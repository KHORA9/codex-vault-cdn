Published April, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is designed primarily to give the farmer a practical working\r\nknowledge of electricity for use as light, heat, and power on the\r\nfarm. The electric generator, the dynamo, is explained in detail; and\r\nthere are chapters on electric transmission and house-wiring, by which\r\nthe farm mechanic is enabled to install his own plant without the aid\r\nand expense of an expert.\r\n\r\nWith modern appliances, within the means of the average farmer, the\r\ngeneration of electricity, with its unique conveniences, becomes\r\nautomatic, provided some dependable source of power is to be had--such\r\nas a water wheel, gasoline (or other form of internal combustion)\r\nengine, or the ordinary windmill. The water wheel is the ideal prime\r\nmover for the dynamo in isolated plants. Since water-power is running\r\nto waste on tens of thousands of our farms throughout the country,\r\nseveral chapters are devoted to this phase of the subject: these\r\ninclude descriptions and working diagrams of weirs and other simple\r\ndevices for measuring the flow of streams; there are tables and\r\nformulas by which any one, with a knowledge of simple arithmetic, may\r\ndetermine the power to be had from falling water under given\r\nconditions; and in addition, there are diagrams showing in general the\r\nmethod of construction of dams, bulkheads, races, flumes, etc., from\r\nmaterials usually to be found on a farm. The tiny unconsidered brook\r\nthat waters the farm pasture frequently possesses power enough to\r\nsupply the farmstead with clean, cool, safe light in place of the\r\ndangerous, inconvenient oil lamp; a small stream capable of developing\r\nfrom twenty-five to fifty horsepower will supply a farmer (at\r\npractically no expense beyond the original cost of installation) not\r\nonly with light, but with power for even the heavier farm operations,\r\nas threshing; and in addition will do the washing, ironing, and\r\ncooking, and at the same time keep the house warm in the coldest\r\nweather. Less than one horsepower of energy will light the farmstead;\r\nless than five horsepower of energy will provide light and small\r\npower, and take the drudgery out of the kitchen.\r\n\r\nFor those not fortunate enough to possess water-power which can be\r\ndeveloped, there are chapters on the use of the farm gasoline engine\r\nand windmill, in connection with the modern storage battery, as\r\nsources of electric current.\r\n\r\nIt is desired to make acknowledgment for illustrations and assistance\r\nin gathering material for the book, to the editors of _The Country\r\nGentleman_, Philadelphia, Pa.; The Crocker-Wheeler Company, Ampere, N.\r\nJ.; The General Electric Company, Schenectady, N.

He would probably spend uncounted hours behind\r\nthe barn learning to throw a lariat; and one fine day he would sally\r\nforth to capture a horsepower or two--and, once captured, he would use\r\nstrength and strategy breaking the wild beast to harness. A single\r\nhorsepower--animal--will do the work of lifting 23,000 pounds one foot\r\nin one minute, providing the animal is young, and sound, and is fed\r\n12 quarts of oats and 10 or 15 pounds of hay a day, and is given a\r\nchance to rest 16 hours out of 24--providing also it has a dentist to\r\ntake care of its teeth occasionally, and a blacksmith chiropodist to\r\nkeep it in shoes. On the hoof, this horsepower is worth about\r\n$200--unless the farmer is looking for something fancy in the way of\r\ndrafters, when he will have to go as high as $400 for a big fellow.\r\nAnd after 10 or 15 years, the farmer would look around for another\r\nhorse, because an animal grows old.\r\n\r\nThis animal horsepower isn't a very efficient horsepower. In fact, it\r\nis less than three-fourths of an actual horsepower, as engineers use\r\nthe term. A real horsepower will do the work of lifting 33,000 pounds\r\none foot in one minute--or 550 pounds one foot in one second. Burn a\r\npint of gasoline, with 14 pounds of air, in a gasoline engine, and the\r\nengine will supply one 33,000-pound horsepower for an hour. The\r\ngasoline will cost about 2 cents, and the air is supplied free. If it\r\nwas the air that cost two cents a pound, instead of the gasoline, the\r\nautomobile industry would undoubtedly stop where it began some fifteen\r\nyears ago. It is human nature, however, to grumble over this two\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nYet the average farmer who would get excited if sound young chunks and\r\ndrafters were running wild across his pastures, is not inspired by any\r\nsimilar desire of possession and mastery by the sight of a brook, or a\r\nrivulet that waters his meadows. This brook or river is flowing down\r\nhill to the sea. Every 4,000 gallons that falls one foot in one\r\nminute; every 400 gallons that falls 10 feet in one minute; or every\r\n40 gallons that falls 100 feet in one minute, means the power of one\r\nhorse going to waste--not the $200 flesh-and-blood kind that can lift\r\nonly 23,000 pounds a foot a minute--but the 33,000 foot-pound kind.\r\nThousands of farms have small streams in their very dooryard, capable\r\nof developing five, ten, twenty, fifty horsepower twenty-four hours a\r\nday, for the greater part of the year. Within a quarter of a mile of\r\nthe great majority of farms (outside of the dry lands themselves)\r\nthere are such streams. Only a small fraction of one per cent of them\r\nhave been put to work, made to pay their passage from the hills to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe United States government geological survey engineers recently made\r\nan estimate of the waterfalls capable of developing 1,000 horsepower\r\nand over, that are running to waste, unused, in this country. They\r\nestimated that there is available, every second of the day and night,\r\nsome 30,000,000 horsepower, in dry weather--and twice this during the\r\neight wet months of the year. The waterfall capable of giving up 1,000\r\nhorsepower in energy is not the subject of these chapters. It is the\r\nsmall streams--the brooks, the creeks, the rivulets--which feed the\r\n1,000 horsepower torrents, make them possible, that are of interest to\r\nthe farmer. These small streams thread every township, every county,\r\nseeking the easiest way to the main valleys where they come together\r\nin great rivers.\r\n\r\nWhat profitable crop on your farm removes the least plant food? A\r\nbee-farmer enters his honey for the prize in this contest. Another\r\nfarmer maintains that his ice-crop is the winner. But electricity\r\ngenerated from falling water of a brook meandering across one's acres,\r\ncomes nearer to the correct answer of how to make something out of\r\nnothing. It merely utilizes the wasted energy of water rolling down\r\nhill--the weight of water, the pulling power of gravity. Water is\r\nstill water, after it has run through a turbine wheel to turn an\r\nelectric generator. It is still wet; it is there for watering the\r\nstock; and a few rods further down stream, where it drops five or ten\r\nfeet again, it can be made to do the same work over again--and over\r\nand over again as long as it continues to fall, on its journey to the\r\nsea. The city of Los Angeles has a municipal water plant, generating\r\n200,000 horsepower of electricity, in which the water is used three\r\ntimes in its fall of 6,000 feet; and in the end, where it runs out of\r\nthe race in the valley, it is sold for irrigation.\r\n\r\nOne water-horsepower will furnish light for the average farm; five\r\nwater-horsepower will furnish light and power, and do the ironing and\r\nbaking. The cost of installing a plant of five water-horsepower should\r\nnot exceed the cost of one sound young horse, the $200 kind--under\r\nconditions which are to be found on thousands of farms and farm\r\ncommunities in the East, the Central West, and the Pacific States.\r\nThis electrical horsepower will work 24 hours a day, winter and\r\nsummer, and the farmer would not have to grow oats and hay for it on\r\nland that might better be used in growing food for human beings. It\r\nwould not become \"aged\" at the end of ten or fifteen years, and the\r\nexpense of maintenance would be practically nothing after the first\r\ncost of installation. It would require only water as food--waste\r\nwater. Two hundred and fifty cubic feet of water a minute, falling ten\r\nfeet, will supply the average farm with all the conveniences of\r\nelectricity. This is a very modest creek--the kind of brook or creek\r\nthat is ignored by the man who would think time well spent in putting\r\nin a week capturing a wild horse, if a miracle should send such a\r\nbeast within reach. And the task of harnessing and breaking this\r\nwater-horsepower is much more simple and less dangerous than the task\r\nof breaking a colt to harness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nWATER-POWER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY FOR THE FARM\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nA WORKING PLANT\r\n\r\n     The \"agriculturist\"--An old chair factory--A neighbor's\r\n     home-coming--The idle wheel in commission again--Light, heat and\r\n     power for nothing--Advantages of electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us take an actual instance of one man who did go ahead and find\r\nout by experience just how intricate and just how simple a thing\r\nelectricity from farm water-power is. This man's name was Perkins, or,\r\nwe will call him that, in relating this story.\r\n\r\nPerkins was what some people call, not a farmer, but an\r\n\"agriculturist,\"--that is, he was a back-to-the-land man. He had been\r\nborn and raised on a farm. He knew that you must harness a horse on\r\nthe left side, milk a cow on the right, that wagon nuts tighten the\r\nway the wheel rims, and that a fresh egg will not float.\r\n\r\nHe had a farm that would grow enough clover to fill the average dairy\r\nif he fed it lime; he had a boy coming to school age; and both he and\r\nhis wife wanted to get back to the country. They had their little\r\nsavings, and they wanted, first of all, to take a vacation, getting\r\nacquainted with their farm. They hadn't taken a vacation in fifteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHe moved in, late in the summer, and started out to get acquainted\r\nwith his neighbors, as well as his land. This was in the New England\r\nhills. Water courses cut through everywhere. In regard to its\r\nbountiful water supply, the neighborhood had much in common with all\r\nthe states east of the Mississippi, along the Atlantic seaboard, in\r\nthe lake region of the central west, and in the Pacific States. With\r\nthis difference; the water courses in his neighborhood had once been\r\nof economic importance.\r\n\r\nA mountain river flowed down his valley. Up and down the valley one\r\nmet ramshackle mills, fallen into decay. Many years ago before\r\nrailroads came, before it was easy to haul coal from place to place\r\nto make steam, these little mills were centers of thriving industries,\r\nwhich depended on the power of falling water to make turned articles,\r\nspin cotton, and so forth. Then the railroads came, and it was easy to\r\nhaul coal to make steam. And the same railroads that hauled the coal\r\nto make steam, were there to haul away the articles manufactured by\r\nsteam power. So in time the little manufacturing plants on the river\r\nback in the hills quit business and moved to railroad stations. Then\r\nNew England, from being a manufacturing community made up of many\r\nsmall isolated water plants, came to be a community made up of huge\r\narteries and laterals of smoke stacks that fringed the railroads.\r\nWhere the railroad happened to follow a river course--as the\r\nConnecticut River--the water-power plants remained; but the little\r\nplants back in the hills were wiped off the map--because steam power\r\nwith railroads at the front door proved cheaper than water-power with\r\nrailroads ten miles away.\r\n\r\nOne night Perkins came in late from a long drive with his next-door\r\nneighbor. He had learned the first rule of courtesy in the country,\r\nwhich is to unhitch his own side of the horse and help back the buggy\r\ninto the shed. They stumbled around in the barn putting up the horse,\r\nand getting down hay and grain for it, by the light of an oil lantern,\r\nwhich was set on the floor in a place convenient to be kicked over. He\r\nwent inside and took supper by the light of a smoky smelly oil lamp,\r\nthat filled the room full of dark corners; and when supper was over,\r\nthe farmwife groped about in the cellar putting things away by the\r\nlight of a candle.\r\n\r\nThe next day his neighbor was grinding cider at his ramshackle water\r\nmill--one of the operations for which a week must be set aside every\r\nfall. Perkins sat on a log and listened to the crunch-crunch of the\r\napples in the chute, and the drip of the frothy yellow liquid that\r\nfell into waiting buckets.\r\n\r\n\"How much power have you got here?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Thirty or forty horsepower, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you do with it, besides grinding cider to pickle your\r\nneighbors' digestion with?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much. I've got a planer and a moulding machine in there, to\r\nwork up jags of lumber occasionally. That's all. This mill was a\r\nchair-factory in my grandfather's day, back in 1830.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you use it thirty days in a year?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not half that.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with it this winter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing; I keep the gate open and the wheel turning, so it won't\r\nfreeze, but nothing else. I am going to take the family to Texas to\r\nvisit my wife's folks for three months. We've worked hard enough to\r\ntake a vacation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you rent me the mill while you are gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead; you can have it for nothing, if you will watch the ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; let me know when you come back and I'll drive to town and\r\nbring you home.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThree months went by, and one day in February the city man, in\r\nresponse to a letter, hitched up and drove to town to bring his\r\nneighbor back home. It was four o'clock in the afternoon when they\r\nstarted out, and it was six--dark--when they turned the bend in the\r\nroad to the farm house. They helped the wife and children out, with\r\ntheir baggage, and as Perkins opened the door of the house, he reached\r\nup on the wall and turned something that clicked sharply.\r\n\r\nInstantly light sprang from everywhere. In the barn-yard a street lamp\r\nwith an 18-inch reflector illuminated all under it for a space of 100\r\nfeet with bright white rays of light. Another street lamp hung over\r\nthe watering trough. The barn doors and windows burst forth in light.\r\nThere was not a dark corner to be found anywhere. In the house it was\r\nthe same. Perkins led the amazed procession from room to room of the\r\nhouse they had shut up for the winter. On the wall in the hall\r\noutside of every room was a button which he pushed, and the room\r\nbecame as light as day before they entered. The cellar door, in\r\nopening, automatically lighted a lamp illuminating that cavern as it\r\nhad never been lighted before since the day a house was built over it.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the farmer and his family were reduced to a state of\r\nspeechlessness.\r\n\r\n\"How the deuce did you do it?\" finally articulated the farmer.\r\n\r\n\"I put your idle water wheel to work,\" said Perkins; and then,\r\nsatisfied with this exhibition, he put them back in the sleigh and\r\ndrove to his home, where his wife had supper waiting.\r\n\r\nWhile the men were putting up the team in the electric lighted barn,\r\nthe farmwife went into the kitchen. Her hostess was cooking supper on\r\nan electric stove. It looked like a city gas range and it cooked all\r\ntheir meals, and did the baking besides. A hot-water tank stood\r\nagainst the wall, not connected to anything hot, apparently. But it\r\nwas scalding hot, by virtue of a little electric water heater the size\r\nof a quart tin can, connected at the bottom. Twenty-four hours a day\r\nthe water wheel pumped electricity into that \"can,\" so that hot water\r\nwas to be had at any hour simply by turning a faucet. In the laundry\r\nthere was an electric pump that kept the tank in the attic filled\r\nautomatically. When the level of water in this tank fell to a certain\r\npoint, a float operated a switch that started the pump; and when the\r\nwater level reached a certain height, the same float stopped the pump.\r\nA small motor, the size of a medium Hubbard squash operated a washing\r\nmachine and wringer on wash days. This same motor was a\r\nman-of-all-work for this house, for, when called on, it turned the\r\nseparator, ground and polished knives and silverware, spun the sewing\r\nmachine, and worked the vacuum cleaner.\r\n\r\nOver the dining room table hung the same hanging shade of old days,\r\nbut the oil lamp itself was gone. In its place was a 100-watt\r\ntungsten lamp whose rays made the white table cloth fairly glisten.\r\nThe wires carrying electricity to this lamp were threaded through the\r\nchains reaching to the ceiling, and one had to look twice to see where\r\nthe current came from. In the sitting room, a cluster of electric\r\nbulbs glowed from a fancy wicker work basket that hung from the\r\nceiling. The housewife had made use of what she had throughout the\r\nhouse. Old-fashioned candle-shades sat like cocked hats astride\r\nelectric bulbs. There is little heat to an electric bulb for the\r\nreason that the white-hot wire that gives the light is made to burn in\r\nhigh vacuum, which transmits heat very slowly. The housewife had taken\r\nadvantage of this fact and from every corner gleamed lights dressed in\r\nfancy designs of tissue paper and silk.\r\n\r\n\"Now we will talk business,\" said Perkins when supper was over and\r\nthey had lighted their pipes.\r\n\r\nThe returned native looked dubious. His New England training had\r\nwarned him long ago that one cannot expect to get something for\r\nnothing, and he felt sure there was a joker in this affair.\r\n\r\n\"How much do I owe you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" said Perkins. \"You furnish the water-power with your idle\r\nwheel, and I furnish the electric installation. This is only a small\r\nplant I have put in, but it gives us enough electricity to go around,\r\nwith a margin for emergencies. I have taken the liberty of wiring your\r\nhouse and your horse-barn and cow-barn and your barn-yard. Altogether,\r\nI suppose you have 30 lights about the place, and during these long\r\nwinter days you will keep most of them going from 3 to 5 hours a night\r\nand 2 or 3 hours in the early morning. If you were in town, those\r\nlights would cost you about 12 cents an hour, at the commercial rate\r\nof electricity. Say 60 cents a day--eighteen dollars a month. That\r\nisn't a very big electric light bill for some people I know in\r\ntown--and they consider themselves lucky to have the privilege of\r\nbuying electricity at that rate. Your wheel is running all winter to\r\nprevent ice from forming and smashing it. It might just as well be\r\nspinning the dynamo.\r\n\r\n\"If you think it worth while,\" continued Perkins,--\"this $18 worth of\r\nlight you have on tap night and morning, or any hour of the day,--we\r\nwill say the account is settled. That is, of course, if you will give\r\nme the use of half the electricity that your idle wheel is grinding\r\nout with my second-hand dynamo. We have about eight electrical\r\nhorsepower on our wires, without overloading the machine. Next spring\r\nI am going to stock up this place; and I think about the first thing I\r\ndo, when my dairy is running, will be to put in a milking machine and\r\nlet electricity do the milking for me. It will also fill my silo,\r\ngrind my mowing-machine knives, saw my wood, and keep water running in\r\nmy barn. You will probably want to do the same.\r\n\r\n\"But what it does for us men in the barn and barn-yard, isn't to be\r\ncompared to what it does for the women in the house. When my wife\r\nwants a hot oven she presses a button. When she wants to put the\r\n'fire' out, she presses another. That's all there is to it. No heat,\r\nno smoke, no ashes. The same with ironing--and washing. No oil lamps\r\nto fill, no wicks to trim, no chimneys to wash, no kerosene to kick\r\nover and start a fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say the current you have put in my house would cost me about $18\r\na month, in town.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, about that. Making electricity from coal costs money.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it cost here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Practically nothing. Your river, that has been running to waste ever\r\nsince your grandfather gave up making chairs, does the work. There is\r\nnothing about a dynamo to wear out, except the bearings, and these can\r\nbe replaced once every five or ten years for a trifle. The machine\r\nneeds to be oiled and cared for--fill the oil cups about once in three\r\ndays. Your water wheel needs the same attention. That's all there is\r\nto it. You can figure the cost of your current yourself--just about\r\nthe cost of the lubricating oil you use--and the cost of the time you\r\ngive it--about the same time you give to any piece of good machinery,\r\nfrom a sulky plow to a cream separator.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a true story. This electric plant, where Perkins furnishes the\r\nelectric end, and his neighbor the water-power, has been running now\r\nfor two years, grinding out electricity for the two places twenty-four\r\nhours a day. Perkins was not an electrical engineer. He was just a\r\nplain intelligent American citizen who found sufficient knowledge in\r\nbooks to enable him to install and operate this plant. Frequently he\r\nis away for long periods, but his neighbor (who has lost his original\r\nterror of electricity) takes care of the plant. In fact, this farmer\r\nhas given a lot of study to the thing, through curiosity, until he\r\nknows fully as much about it now as his city neighbor.\r\n\r\nHe had the usual idea, at the start, that a current strong enough to\r\nlight a 100 candlepower lamp would kick like a mule if a man happened\r\nto get behind it. He watched the city man handle bare wires and\r\nfinally he plucked up courage to do it himself.\r\n\r\nIt was a 110-volt current, the pressure used in our cities for\r\ndomestic lighting. The funny part about it was, the farmer could not\r\nfeel it at all at first. His fingers were calloused and no current\r\ncould pass through them. Finally he sandpapered his fingers and tried\r\nit again. Then he was able to get the \"tickle\" of 110 volts. It wasn't\r\nso deadly after all--about the strength of a weak medical battery,\r\nwith which every one is familiar. A current of 110 volts cannot do any\r\nharm to the human body unless contact is made over a very large\r\nsurface, which is impossible unless a man goes to a lot of trouble to\r\nmake such a contact. A current of 220 volts pressure--the pressure\r\nused in cities for motors--has a little more \"kick\" to it, but still\r\nis not uncomfortable. When the pressure rises to 500 volts (the\r\npressure used in trolley wires for street cars), it begins to be\r\ndangerous. But there is no reason why a farm plant should be over 110\r\nvolts, under usual conditions; engineers have decided on this pressure\r\nas the best adapted to domestic use, and manufacturers who turn out\r\nthe numerous electrical devices, such as irons, toasters, massage\r\nmachines, etc., fit their standard instruments to this voltage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Farm labor and materials built this crib and stone\r\ndam]\r\n\r\nAs to the cost of this co-operative plant--it was in the neighborhood\r\nof $200. As we have said, it provided eight electrical horsepower on\r\ntap at any hour of the day or night--enough for the two farms, and a\r\nsurplus for neighbors, if they wished to string lines and make use of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo, a direct-current machine, 110 volts pressure, and what is\r\nknown in the trade as \"compound,\"--that is, a machine that maintains a\r\nconstant pressure automatically and does not require an attendant--was\r\npicked up second-hand, through a newspaper \"ad\" and cost $90. The\r\nswitchboard, a make-shift affair, not very handsome, but just as\r\nserviceable as if it were made of marble, cost less than $25 all told.\r\nThe transmission wire cost $19 a hundred pounds; it is of copper, and\r\ncovered with weatherproofed tape. Perkins bought a 50-cent book on\r\nhouse-wiring, and did the wiring himself, the way the book told him\r\nto, a simple operation. For fixtures, as we have said, his wife\r\ndevised fancy shades out of Mexican baskets, tissue paper, and silk,\r\nin which are hidden electric globes that glow like fire-flies at the\r\npressing of a button. The lamps themselves are mostly old-style carbon\r\nlamps, which can be bought at 16 cents each retail. In his living room\r\nand dining room he used the new-style tungsten lamps instead of\r\nold-style carbon. These cost 30 cents each. Incandescent lamps are\r\nrated for 1,000 hours useful life. The advantage of tungsten lights is\r\nthat they give three times as much light for the same expenditure of\r\ncurrent as carbon lights. This is a big advantage in the city, where\r\ncurrent is costly; but it is not so much of an advantage in the\r\ncountry where a farmer has plenty of water-power--because his current\r\ncosts him practically nothing, and he can afford to be wasteful of it\r\nto save money in lamps. Another advantage he has over his city cousin:\r\nIn town, an incandescent lamp is thrown away after it has been used\r\n1,000 hours because after that it gives only 80% of the light it did\r\nwhen new--quite an item when one is paying for current. The experience\r\nof Perkins and his neighbor in their coöperative plant has been that\r\nthey have excess light anyway, and if a few bulbs fall off a fifth in\r\nefficiency, it is not noticeable. As a matter of fact most of their\r\nbulbs have been in use without replacing for the two years the plant\r\nhas been in operation. The lamps are on the wall or the ceiling, out\r\nof the way, not liable to be broken; so the actual expense in\r\nreplacing lamps is less than for lamp chimneys in the old days.\r\n\r\nInsurance companies recognize that a large percentage of farm fires\r\ncomes from the use of kerosene; for this reason, they are willing to\r\nmake special rates for farm homes lighted by electricity. They\r\nprescribe certain rules for wiring a house, and they insist that their\r\nagent inspect and pass such wiring before current is turned on. Once\r\nthe wiring is passed, the advantage is all in favor of the farmer\r\nwith electricity over the farmer with kerosene. The National Board of\r\nFire Underwriters is sufficiently logical in its demands, and powerful\r\nenough, so that manufacturers who turn out the necessary fittings find\r\nno sale for devices that do not conform to insurance standards.\r\nTherefore it is difficult to go wrong in wiring a house.\r\n\r\nFinally, as to the added value a water-power electric plant adds to\r\nthe selling price of a farm. Let the farmer answer this question for\r\nhimself. If he can advertise his farm for sale, with a paragraph\r\nrunning: \"Hydroelectric plant on the premises, furnishing electricity\r\nfor light, heat, and power\"--what do you suppose a wide-awake\r\npurchaser would be willing to pay for that? Perkins and his neighbor\r\nbelieve that $1,000 is a very modest estimate added by their electric\r\nplant to both places. And they talk of doing still more. They use only\r\na quarter of the power of the water that is running to waste through\r\nthe wheel. They are figuring on installing a larger dynamo, of say 30\r\nelectrical horse-power, which will provide clean, dry, safe heat for\r\ntheir houses even on the coldest days in winter. When they have done\r\nthis, they will consider that they are really putting their small\r\nriver to work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA LITTLE PROSPECTING\r\n\r\n     Small amount of water required for an electric plant--Exploring, on\r\n     a dull day--A rough and ready weir--What a little water will\r\n     do--The water wheel and the dynamo--Electricity consumed the\r\n     instant it is produced--The price of the average small plant, not\r\n     counting labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe average farmer makes the mistake of considering that one must have\r\na river of some size to develop power of any practical use. On your\r\nnext free day do a little prospecting. We have already said that 250\r\ncubic feet of water falling 10 feet a minute will provide light, heat\r\nand small motor power for the average farm. A single water horsepower\r\nwill generate enough electricity to provide light for the house and\r\nbarn. But let us take five horsepower as a desirable minimum in this\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Measuring a small stream with a weir]\r\n\r\nIn your neighborhood there is a creek three or four feet wide,\r\ntoiling along day by day, at its task of watering your fields. Find a\r\nwide board a little longer than the width of this creek you have\r\nscorned. Set it upright across the stream between the banks, so that\r\nno water flows around the ends or under it. It should be high enough\r\nto set the water back to a dead level for a few feet upstream, before\r\nit overflows. Cut a gate in this board, say three feet wide and ten\r\ninches deep, or according to the size of a stream. Cut this gate from\r\nthe top, so that all the water of the stream will flow through the\r\nopening, and still maintain a level for several feet back of the\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nThis is what engineers call a weir, a handy contrivance for measuring\r\nthe flow of small streams. Experts have figured out an elaborate\r\nsystem of tables as to weirs. All we need to do now, in this rough\r\nsurvey, is to figure out the number of square inches of water flowing\r\nthrough this opening and falling on the other side. With a rule,\r\nmeasure the depth of the overflowing water, from the bottom of the\r\nopening to the top of the dead level of the water behind the board.\r\nMultiply this depth by the width of the opening, which will give the\r\nsquare inches of water escaping. For every square inch of this water\r\nescaping, engineers tell us that stream is capable of delivering,\r\nroughly, one cubic foot of water a minute.\r\n\r\nThus, if the water is 8 inches deep in an opening 32 inches wide, then\r\nthe number of cubic feet this stream is delivering each minute is 8\r\ntimes 32, or 256 cubic feet a minute. So, a stream 32 inches wide,\r\nwith a uniform depth of 8 inches running through our weir is capable\r\nof supplying the demands of the average farm in terms of electricity.\r\nProviding, of course, that the lay of the land is such that this water\r\ncan be made to fall 10 feet into a water wheel.\r\n\r\nGo upstream and make a rough survey of the fall. In the majority of\r\ninstances (unless this is some sluggish stream in a flat prairie) it\r\nwill be found feasible to divert the stream from its main channel by\r\nmeans of a race--an artificial channel--and to convey it to a not\r\nfar-distant spot where the necessary fall can be had at an angle of\r\nabout 30 degrees from horizontal.\r\n\r\nIf you find there is _twice_ as much water as you need for the amount\r\nof power you require, a five-foot fall will give the same result. Or,\r\nif there is only _one-half_ as much water as the 250 cubic feet\r\nspecified, you can still obtain your theoretical five horsepower if\r\nthe means are at hand for providing a fall of twenty feet instead of\r\nten. Do not make the very common mistake of figuring that a stream is\r\ndelivering a cubic foot a minute to each square inch of weir opening,\r\nsimply because it _fills_ a certain opening. It is the excess water,\r\nfalling _over_ the opening, after the stream has set back to a\r\npermanent dead level, that is to be measured.\r\n\r\nThis farmer who spends an idle day measuring the flow of his brook\r\nwith a notched board, may say here: \"This is all very well. This is\r\nthe spring of the year, when my brook is flowing at high-water mark.\r\nWhat am I going to do in the dry months of summer, when there are not\r\n250 cubic feet of water escaping every minute?\"\r\n\r\nThere are several answers to this question, which will be taken up in\r\ndetail in subsequent chapters. Here, let us say, even if this brook\r\ndoes flow in sufficient volume only 8 months in a year--the dark\r\nmonths, by the way,--is not electricity and the many benefits it\r\nprovides worth having eight months in the year? My garden provides\r\nfresh vegetables four months a year. Because it withers and dies and\r\nlies covered with snow during the winter, is that any reason why I\r\nshould not plow and manure and plant my garden when spring comes\r\nagain?\r\n\r\nA water wheel, the modern turbine, is a circular fan with curved iron\r\nblades, revolving in an iron case. Water, forced through the blades of\r\nthis fan by its own weight, causes the wheel to revolve on its axis;\r\nand the fan, in turn causes a shaft fitted with pulleys to revolve.\r\n\r\nThe water, by giving the iron-bladed fan a turning movement as it\r\nrushes through, imparts to it mechanical power. The shaft set in\r\nmotion by means of this mechanical power is, in turn, belted to the\r\npulley of a dynamo. This dynamo consists, first, of a shaft on which\r\nis placed a spool, wound in a curious way, with many turns of\r\ninsulated copper wire. This spool revolves freely in an air space\r\nsurrounded by electric magnets. The spool does not touch these\r\nmagnets. It is so nicely balanced that the weight of a finger will\r\nturn it. Yet, when it is revolved by water-power at a predetermined\r\nspeed--say 1,500 revolutions a minute--it generates electricity,\r\ntransforms the mechanical power of the water wheel into another form\r\nof energy--a form of energy which can be carried for long distances on\r\ncopper wires, which can, by touching a button, be itself converted\r\ninto light, or heat, or back into mechanical energy again.\r\n\r\nIf two wires be led from opposite sides of this revolving spool, and\r\nan electric lamp be connected from one to the other wire, the lamp\r\nwill be lighted--will grow white hot,--hence _incandescent light_.\r\nThe instant this lamp is turned on, the revolving spool feels a\r\nstress, the magnets by which it is surrounded begin to pull back on\r\nit. The power of the water wheel, however, overcomes this pull. If one\r\nhundred lights be turned on, the backward pull of the magnets\r\nsurrounding the spool will be one hundred times as strong as for one\r\nlight. For every ounce of electrical energy used in light or heat or\r\npower, the dynamo will require a like ounce of mechanical power from\r\nthe water wheel which drives it.\r\n\r\nThe story is told of a canny Scotch engineer, who, in the first days\r\nof dynamos, not so very long ago, scoffed at the suggestion that such\r\na spool, spinning in free air, in well lubricated bearings, could\r\nbring his big Corliss steam engine to a stop. Yet he saw it done\r\nsimply by belting this \"spool,\" a dynamo, to his engine and asking the\r\ndynamo for more power in terms of light than his steam could deliver\r\nin terms of mechanical power to overcome the pull of the magnets.\r\n\r\nElectricity must be consumed the instant it is generated (except in\r\nrare instances where small amounts are accumulated in storage\r\nbatteries by a chemical process). The pressure of a button, or the\r\nthrow of a switch causes the dynamo instantly to respond with just\r\nenough energy to do the work asked of it, always in proportion to the\r\namount required. Having this in mind, it is rather curious to think of\r\nelectricity as being an article of export, an item in international\r\ntrade. Yet in 1913 hydro-electric companies in Canada \"exported\" by\r\nmeans of wires, to this country over 772,000,000 kilowatt-hours (over\r\none billion horsepower hours) of electricity for use in factories near\r\nthe boundary line.\r\n\r\nThis 250 cubic feet of water per minute then, which the farmer has\r\nmeasured by means of his notched board, will transform by means of its\r\nfalling weight mechanical power into a like amount of electrical\r\npower--less friction losses, which may amount to as much as 60% in\r\nvery small machines, and 15% in larger plants. That is, the brook\r\nwhich has been draining your pastures for uncounted ages contains the\r\npotential power of 3 and 4 young horses--with this difference: that it\r\nworks 24 hours a day, runs on forever, and requires no oats or hay.\r\nAnd the cost of such an electric plant, which is ample for the needs\r\nof the average farm, _is in most cases less than the price of a good\r\nfarm horse_--the $200 kind--not counting labor of installation.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of these chapters to awaken the farmer to the\r\npossibilities of such small water-power as he or his community may\r\npossess; to show that the generating of electricity is a very simple\r\noperation, and that the maintenance and care of such a plant is within\r\nthe mechanical ability of any American farmer or farm boy; and to show\r\nthat electricity itself is far from being the dangerous death-dealing\r\n\"fluid\" of popular imagination. Electricity must be studied; and then\r\nit becomes an obedient, tireless servant. During the past decade or\r\ntwo, mathematical wizards have studied electricity, explored its\r\natoms, reduced it to simple arithmetic--and although they cannot yet\r\ntell us _why_ it is generated, they tell us _how_. It is with this\r\nsimple arithmetic, and the necessary manual operations that we have to\r\ndo here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHOW TO MEASURE WATER-POWER\r\n\r\n     What is a horsepower?--How the Carthaginians manufactured\r\n     horsepower--All that goes up must come down--How the sun lifts\r\n     water up for us to use--Water the ideal power for generating\r\n     electricity--The weir--Table for estimating flow of streams, with a\r\n     weir--Another method of measuring--Figuring water horsepower--The\r\n     size of the wheel--What head is required--Quantity of water\r\n     necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a man were off in the woods and needed a horsepower of energy to\r\nwork for him, he could generate it by lifting 550 pounds of stone or\r\nwood, or whatnot, one foot off the ground, and letting it fall back in\r\nthe space of one second. As a man possesses capacity for work equal to\r\none-fifth horsepower, it would take him five seconds to do the work of\r\nlifting the weight up that the weight itself accomplished in falling\r\ndown. All that goes up must come down; and by a nice balance of\r\nphysical laws, a falling body hits the ground with precisely the same\r\nforce as is required to lift it to the height from which it falls.\r\n\r\nThe Carthaginians, and other ancients (who were deep in the woods as\r\nregards mechanical knowledge) had their slaves carry huge stones to\r\nthe top of the city wall; and the stones were placed in convenient\r\npositions to be tipped over on the heads of any besieging army that\r\nhappened along. Thus by concentrating the energy of many slaves in one\r\nbatch of stones, the warriors of that day were enabled to deliver\r\n\"horsepower\" in one mass where it would do the most good. The farmer\r\nwho makes use of the energy of falling water to generate electricity\r\nfor light, heat, and power does the same thing--he makes use of the\r\ncapacity for work stored in water in being lifted to a certain height.\r\nAs in the case of the gasoline engine, which burns 14 pounds of air\r\nfor every pound of gasoline, the engineer of the water-power plant\r\ndoes not have to concern himself with the question of how this\r\nnatural source of energy happened to be in a handy place for him to\r\nmake use of it.\r\n\r\nThe sun, shining on the ocean, and turning water into vapor by its\r\nheat has already lifted it up for him. This vapor floating in the air\r\nand blown about by winds, becomes chilled from one cause or another,\r\ngives up its heat, turns back into water, and falls as rain. This\r\nrain, falling on land five, ten, a hundred, a thousand, or ten\r\nthousand feet above the sea level, begins to run back to the sea,\r\npicking out the easiest road and cutting a channel that we call a\r\nbrook, a stream, or a river. Our farm lands are covered to an average\r\ndepth of about three feet a year with water, every gallon of which has\r\nstored in it the energy expended by the heat of the sun in lifting it\r\nto the height where it is found.\r\n\r\nThe farmer, prospecting on his land for water-power, locates a spot on\r\na stream which he calls Supply; and another spot a few feet down hill\r\nnear the same stream, which he calls Power. Every gallon of water that\r\nfalls between these two points, and is made to escape through the\r\nrevolving blades of a water wheel is capable of work in terms of\r\nfoot-pounds--an amount of work that is directly proportional to the\r\n_quantity_ of water, and to the _distance_ in feet which it falls to\r\nreach the wheel--_pounds_ and _feet_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Efficient Water Wheel_\r\n\r\nAnd it is a very efficient form of work, too. In fact it is one of the\r\nmost efficient forms of mechanical energy known--and one of the\r\neasiest controlled. A modern water wheel uses 85 per cent of the total\r\ncapacity for work imparted to falling water by gravity, and delivers\r\nit as rotary motion. Compare this water wheel efficiency with other\r\nforms of mechanical power in common use: Whereas a water wheel uses 85\r\nper cent of the energy of its water supply, and wastes only 15 per\r\ncent, a gasoline engine reverses the table, and delivers only 15 per\r\ncent of the energy in gasoline and wastes 85 per cent--and it is\r\nrather a high-class gasoline engine that can deliver even 15 per cent;\r\na steam engine, on the other hand, uses about 17 per cent of the\r\nenergy in the coal under its boilers and passes the rest up the\r\nchimney as waste heat and smoke.\r\n\r\nThere is still another advantage possessed by water-power over its two\r\nrivals, steam and gas: It gives the most even flow of power. A gas\r\nengine \"kicks\" a wheel round in a circle, by means of successive\r\nexplosions in its cylinders. A reciprocating steam engine \"kicks\" a\r\nwheel round in a circle by means of steam expanding first in one\r\ndirection, then in another. A water wheel, on the other hand, is made\r\nto revolve by means of the pressure of water--by the constant force of\r\ngravity, itself--weight. Weight is something that does not vary from\r\nminute to minute, or from one fraction of a second to another. It is\r\nalways the same. A square inch of water pressing on the blades of a\r\nwater wheel weights ten, twenty, a hundred pounds, according to the\r\nheight of the pipe conveying that water from the source of supply, to\r\nthe wheel. So long as this column of water is maintained at a fixed\r\nheight, the power it delivers to the wheel does not vary by so much as\r\nthe weight of a feather.\r\n\r\nThis property of falling water makes it the ideal power for generating\r\nelectricity. Electricity generated from mechanical power depends on\r\nconstant speed for steady pressure--since the electric current, when\r\nanalyzed, is merely a succession of pulsations through a wire, like\r\nwaves beating against a sea wall. Water-power delivers these waves at\r\na constant speed, so that electric lights made from water-power do not\r\nflicker and jump like the flame of a lantern in a gusty wind. On the\r\nother hand, to accomplish the same thing with steam or gasoline\r\nrequires an especially constructed engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Simple Weir_\r\n\r\nSince a steady flow of water, and a constant head, bring about this\r\nideal condition in the water wheel, the first problem that faces the\r\nfarmer prospector is to determine the amount of water which his stream\r\nis capable of delivering. This is always measured, for convenience,\r\nin _cubic feet per minute_. (A cubic foot of water weighs 62.5 pounds,\r\nand contains 7-1/2 gallons.) This measurement is obtained in several\r\nways, among which probably the use of a weir is the simplest and most\r\naccurate, for small streams.\r\n\r\nA weir is, in effect, merely a temporary dam set across the stream in\r\nsuch a manner as to form a small pond; and to enable one to measure\r\nthe water escaping from this pond.\r\n\r\nIt may be likened to the overflow pipe of a horse trough which is\r\nbeing fed from a spring. To measure the flow of water from such a\r\nspring, all that is necessary is to measure the water escaping through\r\nthe overflow when the water in the trough has attained a permanent\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of home-made weir]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross-section of weir]\r\n\r\nThe diagrams show the cross-section and detail of a typical weir,\r\nwhich can be put together in a few minutes with the aid of a saw and\r\nhammer. The cross-section shows that the lower edge of the slot\r\nthrough which the water of the temporary pond is made to escape, is\r\ncut on a bevel, with its sharp edge upstream. The wing on each side of\r\nthe opening is for the purpose of preventing the stream from narrowing\r\nas it flows through the opening, and thus upsetting the calculations.\r\nThis weir should be set directly across the flow of the stream,\r\nperfectly level, and upright. It should be so imbedded in the banks,\r\nand in the bottom of the stream, that no water can escape, except\r\nthrough the opening cut for that purpose. It will require a little\r\nexperimenting with a rough model to determine just how wide and how\r\ndeep this opening should be. It should be large enough to prevent\r\nwater flowing over the top of the board; and it should be small\r\nenough to cause a still-water pond to form for several feet behind the\r\nweir. Keep in mind the idea of the overflowing water trough when\r\nbuilding your weir. The stream, running down from a higher level\r\nbehind, should be emptying into a still-water pond, which in turn\r\nshould be emptying itself through the aperture in the board at the\r\nsame rate as the stream is keeping the pond full.\r\n\r\nYour weir should be fashioned with the idea of some permanency so that\r\na number of measurements may be taken, extending over a period of\r\ntime--thus enabling the prospector to make a reliable estimate not\r\nonly of the amount of water flowing at any one time, but of its\r\nfluctuations.\r\n\r\nUnder expert supervision, this simple weir is an exact\r\ncontrivance--exact enough, in fact, for the finest calculations\r\nrequired in engineering work. To find out how many cubic feet of water\r\nthe stream is delivering at any moment, all that is necessary is to\r\nmeasure its depth where it flows through the opening. There are\r\ninstruments, like the hook-gauge, which are designed to measure this\r\ndepth with accuracy up to one-thousandth of an inch. An ordinary foot\r\nrule, or a folding rule, will give results sufficiently accurate for\r\nthe water prospector in this instance. The depth should be measured\r\nnot at the opening itself, but a short distance back of the opening,\r\nwhere the water is setting at a dead level and is moving very slowly.\r\n\r\nWith this weir, every square inch of water flowing through the opening\r\nindicates roughly one cubic foot of water a minute. Thus if the\r\nopening is 10 inches wide and the water flowing through it is 5 inches\r\ndeep, the number of cubic feet a minute the stream is delivering is 10\r\n× 5 = 50 square inches = 50 cubic feet a minute. This is a very small\r\nstream; yet, if it could be made to fall through a water wheel 10 feet\r\nbelow a pond or reservoir, it would exert a continuous pressure of\r\n30,000 pounds per minute on the blades of the wheel--nearly one\r\ntheoretical horsepower.\r\n\r\nThis estimate of one cubic foot to each square inch is a very rough\r\napproximation. Engineers have developed many complicated formulas for\r\ndetermining the flow of water through weirs, taking into account fine\r\nvariations that the farm prospector need not heed. The so-called\r\nFrancis formula, developed by a long series of actual experiments at\r\nLowell, Mass., in 1852 by Mr. James B. Francis, with weirs 10 feet\r\nlong and 5 feet 2 inches high, is standard for these calculations and\r\nis expressed (for those who desire to use it for special purposes) as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Q = 3.33 L H^(3/2) or, Q = 3.33 L H sqrt(H),\r\n\r\nin which Q means _quantity_ of water in cubic feet per second, L is\r\nlength of opening, in feet; and H is height of opening in feet.\r\n\r\nThe following table is figured according to the Francis formula, and\r\ngives the discharge in cubic feet per minute, for openings one inch\r\nwide:\r\n\r\nTABLE OF WEIRS\r\n\r\n    Inches        0         1/4        1/2        3/4\r\n       1        0.403      0.563      0.740      0.966\r\n       2        1.141      1.360      1.593      1.838\r\n       3        2.094      2.361      2.639      2.927\r\n       4        3.225      3.531      3.848      4.173\r\n       5        4.506      4.849      5.200      5.558\r\n       6        5.925      6.298      6.681      7.071\r\n       7        7.465      7.869      8.280      8.697\r\n       8        9.121      9.552      9.990     10.427\r\n       9       10.884     11.340     11.804     12.272\r\n      10       12.747     13.228     13.716     14.208\r\n      11       14.707     15.211     15.721     16.236\r\n      12       16.757     17.283     17.816     18.352\r\n      13       18.895     19.445     19.996     20.558\r\n      14       21.116     21.684     22.258     22.835\r\n      15       23.418     24.007     24.600     25.195\r\n      16       25.800     26.406     27.019     27.634\r\n      17       28.256     28.881     29.512     30.145\r\n      18       30.785     31.429     32.075     32.733\r\n\r\nThus, let us say, our weir has an opening 30 inches wide, and the\r\nwater overflows through the opening at a uniform depth of 6-1/4\r\ninches, when measured a few inches behind the board at a point before\r\nthe overflow curve begins. Run down the first column on the left to\r\n\"6\", and cross over to the second column to the right, headed \"1/4\".\r\nThis gives the number of cubic feet per minute for this depth one inch\r\nwide, as 6.298. Since the weir is 30 inches wide, multiply 6.298 × 30\r\n= 188.94--or, say, 189 cubic feet per minute.\r\n\r\nOnce the weir is set, it is the work of but a moment to find out the\r\nquantity of water a stream is delivering, simply by referring to the\r\nabove table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Another Method of Measuring a Stream_\r\n\r\nWeirs are for use in small streams. For larger streams, where the\r\nconstruction of a weir would be difficult, the U. S. Geological Survey\r\nengineers recommend the following simple method:\r\n\r\nChoose a place where the channel is straight for 100 or 200 feet, and\r\nhas a nearly constant depth and width; lay off on the bank a line 50\r\nor 100 feet in length. Throw small chips into the stream, and measure\r\nthe time in seconds they take to travel the distance laid off on the\r\nbank. This gives the surface velocity of the water. Multiply the\r\naverage of several such tests by 0.80, which will give very nearly the\r\nmean velocity. Then it is necessary to find the cross-section of the\r\nflowing water (its average depth multiplied by width), and this\r\nnumber, in square feet, multiplied by the velocity in feet per second,\r\nwill give the number of cubic feet the stream is delivering each\r\nsecond. Multiplied by 60 gives cubic feet a minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Figuring a Stream's Horsepower_\r\n\r\nBy one of the above simple methods, the problem of _Quantity_ can\r\neasily be determined. The next problem is to determine what _Head_ can\r\nbe obtained. _Head_ is the distance in feet the water may be made to\r\nfall, from the Source of Supply, to the water wheel itself. The power\r\nof water is directly proportional to _head_, just as it is directly\r\nproportional to _quantity_. Thus the typical weir measured above was\r\n30 inches wide and 6-1/4 deep, giving 189 cubic feet of water a\r\nminute--_Quantity._ Since such a stream is of common occurrence on\r\nthousands of farms, let us analyze briefly its possibilities for\r\npower: One hundred and eighty-nine cubic feet of water weighs 189 ×\r\n62.5 pounds = 11,812.5 pounds. Drop this weight one foot, and we have\r\n11,812.5 foot-pounds. Drop it 3 feet and we have 11,812 × 3 =\r\n35,437.5 foot-pounds. Since 33,000 foot-pounds exerted in one minute\r\nis one horsepower, we have here a little more than one horsepower. For\r\nsimplicity let us call it a horsepower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of a water-power plant, showing setting of\r\nwheel, and dynamo connection]\r\n\r\nNow, since the work to be had from this water varies directly with\r\n_quantity_ and _head_, it is obvious that a stream _one-half_ as big\r\nfalling _twice_ as far, would still give one horsepower at the wheel;\r\nor, a stream of 189 cubic feet a minute falling _ten times_ as far, 30\r\nfeet, would give _ten times_ the power, or _ten_ horsepower; a stream\r\nfalling _one hundred times_ as far would give _one hundred_\r\nhorsepower. Thus small quantities of water falling great distances, or\r\nlarge quantities of water falling small distances may accomplish the\r\nsame results. From this it will be seen, that the simple formula for\r\ndetermining the theoretical horsepower of any stream, in which\r\nQuantity and Head are known, is as follows:\r\n\r\n                               Cu. Ft.\r\n                               per       Feet\r\n                               minute  × head × 62.5\r\n  (A) Theoretical Horsepower = ----------------------\r\n                                       33,000\r\n\r\n_As an example, let us say that we have a stream whose weir\r\nmeasurement shows it capable of delivering 376 cubic feet a minute,\r\nwith a head (determined by survey) of 13 feet 6 inches. What is the\r\nhorsepower of this stream?_\r\n\r\n  Answer:\r\n\r\n         Cu. ft. p. m.   head   pounds\r\n            376        × 13.5 ×  62.5\r\n  H.P. = ----------------------------- = 9.614 horsepower\r\n                     33,000\r\n\r\nThis is _theoretical horsepower_. To determine the _actual_ horsepower\r\nthat can be counted on, in practice, it is customary, with small water\r\nwheels, to figure 25 per cent loss through friction, etc. In this\r\ninstance, the actual horsepower would then be 7.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Size of the Wheel_\r\n\r\nWater wheels are not rated by horsepower by manufacturers, because the\r\nsame wheel might develop one horsepower or one hundred horsepower, or\r\neven a thousand horsepower, according to the conditions under which\r\nit is used. With a given supply of water, the head, in feet,\r\ndetermines the size of wheel necessary. The farther a stream of water\r\nfalls, the smaller the pipe necessary to carry a given number of\r\ngallons past a given point in a given time.\r\n\r\nA small wheel, under 10 × 13.5 ft. head, would give the same power\r\nwith the above 376 cubic feet of water a minute, as a large wheel\r\nwould with 10 × 376 cubic feet, under a 13.5 foot head.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the _acceleration of gravity_ on falling bodies. A\r\nrifle bullet shot into the air with a muzzle velocity of 3,000 feet a\r\nsecond begins to diminish its speed instantly on leaving the muzzle,\r\nand continues to diminish in speed at the fixed rate of 32.16 feet a\r\nsecond, until it finally comes to a stop, and starts to descend. Then,\r\nagain, its speed accelerates at the rate of 32.16 feet a second, until\r\non striking the earth it has attained the velocity at which it left\r\nthe muzzle of the rifle, less loss due to friction.\r\n\r\nThe acceleration of gravity affects falling water in the same manner\r\nas it affects a falling bullet. At any one second, during its course\r\nof fall, it is traveling at a rate 32.16 feet a second in excess of\r\nits speed the previous second.\r\n\r\nIn figuring the size wheel necessary under given conditions or to\r\ndetermine the power of water with a given nozzle opening, it is\r\nnecessary to take this into account. The table on page 51 gives\r\nvelocity per second of falling water, ignoring the friction of the\r\npipe, in heads from 5 to 1000 feet.\r\n\r\nThe scientific formula from which the table is computed is expressed\r\nas follows, for those of a mathematical turn of mind:\r\n\r\nVelocity (ft. per sec.) = sqrt(2gh); or, velocity is equal to the\r\nsquare root of the product (g = 32.16,--times head in feet, multiplied\r\nby 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n    SPOUTING VELOCITY OF WATER, IN FEET PER SECOND, IN HEADS\r\n    OF FROM 5 TO 1,000 FEET\r\n\r\n      Head   Velocity\r\n\r\n       5       17.9\r\n       6       19.7\r\n       7       21.2\r\n       8       22.7\r\n       9       24.1\r\n      10       25.4\r\n      11       26.6\r\n      11.5     27.2\r\n      12       27.8\r\n      12.5     28.4\r\n      13       28.9\r\n      13.5     29.5\r\n      14       30.0\r\n      14.5     30.5\r\n      15       31.3\r\n      15.5     31.6\r\n      16       32.1\r\n      16.5     32.6\r\n      17       33.1\r\n      17.5     33.6\r\n      18       34.0\r\n      18.5     34.5\r\n      19       35.0\r\n      19.5     35.4\r\n      20       35.9\r\n      20.5     36.3\r\n      21       36.8\r\n      21.5     37.2\r\n      22       37.6\r\n      22.5     38.1\r\n      23       38.5\r\n      23.5     38.9\r\n      24       39.3\r\n      24.5     39.7\r\n      25       40.1\r\n      26       40.9\r\n      27       41.7\r\n      28       42.5\r\n      29       43.2\r\n      30       43.9\r\n      31       44.7\r\n      32       45.4\r\n      33       46.1\r\n      34       46.7\r\n      35       47.4\r\n      36       48.1\r\n      37       48.8\r\n      38       49.5\r\n      39       50.1\r\n      40       50.7\r\n      41       51.3\r\n      42       52.0\r\n      43       52.6\r\n      44       53.2\r\n      45       53.8\r\n      46       54.4\r\n      47       55.0\r\n      48       55.6\r\n      49       56.2\r\n      50       56.7\r\n      55       59.5\r\n      60       62.1\r\n      65       64.7\r\n      70       67.1\r\n      75       69.5\r\n      80       71.8\r\n      85       74.0\r\n      90       76.1\r\n      95       78.2\r\n     100       80.3\r\n     200      114.0\r\n     300      139.0\r\n     400      160.0\r\n     500      179.0\r\n    1000      254.0\r\n\r\n\r\n_In the above example, we found that 376 cubic feet of water a minute,\r\nunder 13.5 feet head, would deliver 7.2 actual horsepower. Question:\r\nWhat size wheel would it be necessary to install under such\r\nconditions?_\r\n\r\nBy referring to the table of velocity above, (or by using the\r\nformula), we find that water under a head of 13.5 feet, has a spouting\r\nvelocity of 29.5 feet a second. This means that a solid stream of\r\nwater 29.5 feet long would pass through the wheel in one second. _What\r\nshould be the diameter of such a stream, to make its cubical contents\r\n376 cubic feet a minute or 376/60 = 6.27 cubic feet a second?_ The\r\nfollowing formula should be used to determine this:\r\n\r\n                             144 × cu. ft. per second\r\n  (B) Sq. Inches of wheel = --------------------------\r\n                             Velocity in ft. per sec.\r\n\r\nSubstituting values, in the above instance, we have:\r\n\r\n  Answer: Sq. Inches of wheel =\r\n\r\n       144 × 6.27 (Cu. Ft. Sec.)\r\n      --------------------------- = 30.6 sq. in.\r\n          29.5 (Vel. in feet.)\r\n\r\nThat is, a wheel capable of using 30.6 square inches of water would\r\nmeet these conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What Head is Required_\r\n\r\nLet us attack the problem of water-power in another way. _A farmer\r\nwishes to install a water wheel that will deliver 10 horsepower on the\r\nshaft, and he finds his stream delivers 400 cubic feet of water a\r\nminute. How many feet fall is required?_ Formula:\r\n\r\n                      33,000 × horsepower required\r\n  (C) Head in feet = ------------------------------\r\n                       Cu. Ft. per minute × 62.5\r\n\r\nSince a theoretical horsepower is only 75 per cent efficient, he would\r\nrequire 10 × 4/3 = 13.33 theoretical horsepower of water, in this\r\ninstance. Substituting the values of the problem in the formula, we\r\nhave:\r\n\r\n                  33,000 × 13.33\r\n  Answer: Head = ---------------- = 17.6 feet fall required.\r\n                    400 × 62.5\r\n\r\n_What capacity of wheel would this prospect (400 cubic feet of water a\r\nminute falling 17.6 feet, and developing 13.33 horsepower) require?_\r\n\r\nBy referring to the table of velocities, we find that the velocity for\r\n17.5 feet head (nearly) is 33.6 feet a second. Four hundred feet of\r\nwater a minute is 400/60 = 6.67 cu. ft. a second. Substituting these\r\nvalues, in formula (B) then, we have:\r\n\r\n  Answer: Capacity of wheel =\r\n\r\n      144 × 6.67\r\n      ---------- = 28.6 square inches of water.\r\n         33.6\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quantity of Water_\r\n\r\nLet us take still another problem which the prospector may be called\r\non to solve: _A man finds that he can conveniently get a fall of 27\r\nfeet. He desires 20 actual horsepower. What quantity of water will be\r\nnecessary, and what capacity wheel?_\r\n\r\nTwenty actual horsepower will be 20 × 4/3 = 26.67 theoretical\r\nhorsepower. Formula:\r\n\r\n                              33,000 × Hp. required\r\n  (D) Cubic feet per minute = ---------------------\r\n                              (Head in feet × 62.5)\r\n\r\nSubstituting values, then, we have:\r\n\r\n  Cu. ft. per minute =\r\n\r\n  33,000 × 26.67\r\n  -------------- = 521.5 cubic feet a minute.\r\n    27 × 62.5\r\n\r\nA head of 27 feet would give this stream a velocity of 41.7 feet a\r\nsecond, and, from formula (B) we find that the capacity of the wheel\r\nshould be 30 square inches.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember that the square inches of wheel capacity does\r\nnot refer to the size of pipe conveying water from the head to the\r\nwheel, but merely to the actual nozzle capacity provided by the wheel\r\nitself. In small installations of low head, such as above a penstock\r\nat least six times the nozzle capacity should be used, to avoid losing\r\neffective head from friction. Thus, with a nozzle of 30 square inches,\r\nthe penstock or pipe should be 180 square inches, or nearly 14 inches\r\nsquare inside measurement. A larger penstock would be still better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE WATER WHEEL AND HOW TO INSTALL IT\r\n\r\n     Different types of water wheels--The impulse and reaction\r\n     wheels--The impulse wheel adapted to high heads and small amount of\r\n     water--Pipe lines--Table of resistance in pipes--Advantages and\r\n     disadvantages of the impulse wheel--Other forms of impulse\r\n     wheels--The reaction turbine, suited to low heads and large\r\n     quantity of water--Its advantages and limitations--Developing a\r\n     water-power project: the dam; the race; the flume; the penstock;\r\n     and the tailrace--Water rights for the farmer.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, there are two types of water wheels, the _impulse_ wheel\r\nand the _reaction_ wheel. Both are called turbines, although the name\r\nbelongs, more properly, to the reaction wheel alone.\r\n\r\nImpulse wheels derive their power from the _momentum_ of falling\r\nwater. Reaction wheels derive their power from the _momentum and\r\npressure_ of falling water. The old-fashioned _undershot_, _overshot_,\r\nand _breast_ wheels are familiar to all as examples of impulse\r\nwheels. Water wheels of this class revolve in the air, with the energy\r\nof the water exerted on one face of their buckets. On the other hand,\r\nreaction wheels are enclosed in water-tight cases, either of metal or\r\nof wood, and the buckets are entirely surrounded by water.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned undershot, overshot, and breast wheels were not very\r\nefficient; they wasted about 75 per cent of the power applied to them.\r\nA modern impulse wheel, on the other hand, operates at an efficiency\r\nof 80 per cent and over. The loss is mainly through friction and\r\nleakage, and cannot be eliminated altogether. The modern reaction\r\nwheel, called the _turbine_, attains an equal efficiency. Individual\r\nconditions govern the type of wheel to be selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Impulse, or Tangential Water Wheel_\r\n\r\nThe modern impulse, or tangential wheel (so called because the driving\r\nstream of water strikes the wheel at a tangent) is best adapted to\r\nsituations where the amount of water is limited, and the head is\r\nlarge. Thus, a mountain brook supplying only seven cubic feet of water\r\na minute--a stream less than two-and-a-half inches deep flowing over a\r\nweir with an opening three inches wide--would develop two actual\r\nhorsepower, under a head of 200 feet--not an unusual head to be found\r\nin the hill country. Under a head of one thousand feet, a stream\r\nfurnishing 352.6 cubic feet of water a minute would develop 534.01\r\nhorsepower at the nozzle.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily these wheels are not used under heads of less than 20 feet.\r\nA wheel of this type, six feet in diameter, would develop six\r\nhorsepower, with 188 cubic feet of water a minute and 20-foot head.\r\nThe great majority of impulse wheels are used under heads of 100 feet\r\nand over. In this country the greatest head in use is slightly over\r\n2,100 feet, although in Switzerland there is one plant utilizing a\r\nhead of over 5,000 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Runner of Pelton wheel, showing peculiar shape of the\r\nbuckets]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Fitz overshoot wheel\r\n\r\nEfficient Modern Adaptations of the Archaic Undershot and Overshot\r\nWater Wheels]\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned impulse wheels were inefficient because of the fact\r\nthat their buckets were not constructed scientifically, and much of\r\nthe force of the water was lost at the moment of impact. The impulse\r\nwheel of to-day, however, has buckets which so completely absorb the\r\nmomentum of water issuing from a nozzle, that the water falls into the\r\ntailrace with practically no velocity. When it is remembered that the\r\nnozzle pressure under a 2,250-foot head is nearly 1,000 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch, and that water issues from this nozzle with a velocity of\r\n23,000 feet a minute, the scientific precision of this type of bucket\r\ncan be appreciated.\r\n\r\nA typical bucket for such a wheel is shaped like an open clam shell,\r\nthe central line which cuts the stream of water into halves being\r\nground to a sharp edge. The curves which absorb the momentum of the\r\nwater are figured mathematically and in practice become polished like\r\nmirrors. So great is the eroding action of water, under great\r\nheads--especially when it contains sand or silt--that it is\r\noccasionally necessary to replace these buckets. For this reason the\r\nlarger wheels consist merely of a spider of iron or steel, with each\r\nbucket bolted separately to its circumference, so that it can be\r\nremoved and replaced easily. Usually only one nozzle is provided; but\r\nin order to use this wheel under low heads--down to 10 feet--a number\r\nof nozzles are used, sometimes five, where the water supply is\r\nplentiful.\r\n\r\nThe wheel is keyed to a horizontal shaft running in babbited bearings,\r\nand this same shaft is used for driving the generator, either by\r\ndirect connection, or by means of pulleys and a belt. The wheel may be\r\nmounted on a home-made timber base, or on an iron frame. It takes up\r\nvery little room, especially when it is so set that the nozzle can be\r\nmounted under the flooring. The wheel itself is enclosed, above the\r\nfloor, in a wooden box, or a casing made of cast or sheet iron, which\r\nshould be water-tight.\r\n\r\nSince these wheels are usually operated under great heads, the problem\r\nof regulating their water supply requires special consideration. A\r\ngate is always provided at the upper, or intake end, where the water\r\npipe leaves the flume. Since the pressure reaches 1,000 pounds the\r\nsquare inch and more, there would be danger of bursting the pipe if\r\nthe water were suddenly shut off at the nozzle itself. For this reason\r\nit is necessary to use a needle valve, similar to that in an ordinary\r\ngarden hose nozzle; and by such a valve the amount of water may be\r\nregulated to a nicety. Where the head is so great that even such a\r\nvalve could not be used safely, provision is made to deflect the\r\nnozzle. These wheels have a speed variation amounting to as much as 25\r\nper cent from no-load to full load, in generating electricity, and\r\nsince the speed of the prime mover--the water wheel--is reflected\r\ndirectly in the voltage or pressure of electricity delivered, the\r\nwheel must be provided with some form of automatic governor. This\r\nconsists usually of two centrifugal balls, similar to those used in\r\ngoverning steam engines; these are connected by means of gears to the\r\nneedle valve or the deflector.\r\n\r\nAs the demand for farm water-powers in our hill sections becomes more\r\ngeneral, the tangential type of water wheel will come into common use\r\nfor small plants. At present it is most familiar in the great\r\ncommercial installations of the Far West, working under enormous\r\nheads. These wheels are to be had in the market ranging in size from\r\nsix inches to six feet and over. Wheels ranging in size from six\r\ninches to twenty-four inches are called water motors, and are to be\r\nhad in the market, new, for $30 for the smallest size, and $275 for\r\nthe largest. Above three feet in diameter, the list prices will run\r\nfrom $200 for a 3-foot wheel to $800 for a 6-foot wheel. Where one has\r\na surplus of water, it is possible to install a multiple nozzle wheel,\r\nunder heads of from 10 to 100 feet, the cost for 18-inch wheels of\r\nthis pattern running from $150 to $180 list, and for 24-inch wheels\r\nfrom $200 to $250. A 24-inch wheel, with a 10-foot head would give\r\n1.19 horsepower, enough for lighting the home, and using an electric\r\niron. Under a 100-foot head this same wheel would provide 25.9\r\nhorsepower, to meet the requirements of a bigger-than-average farm\r\nplant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Pipe Line_\r\n\r\nThe principal items of cost in installing an impulse wheel are in\r\nconnection with the pipe line, and the governor. In small heads, that\r\nis, under 100 feet, the expense of pipe line is low. Frequently,\r\nhowever, the governor will cost more than the water motor itself,\r\nalthough cheaper, yet efficient, makes are now being put on the market\r\nto meet this objection. In a later chapter, we will take up in detail\r\nthe question of governing the water wheel, and voltage regulation, and\r\nwill attempt to show how this expense may be practically eliminated by\r\nthe farmer.\r\n\r\nTo secure large heads, it is usually necessary to run a pipe line many\r\nhundreds (and in many cases, many thousands) of feet from the flume to\r\nthe water wheel. Water flowing through pipes is subject to loss of\r\nhead, by friction, and for this reason the larger the pipe the less\r\nthe friction loss. Under no circumstances is it recommended to use a\r\npipe of less than two inches in diameter, even for the smallest water\r\nmotors; and with a two-inch pipe, the run should not exceed 200 feet.\r\nWhere heavy-pressure mains, such as those of municipal or commercial\r\nwater systems, are available, the problem of both water supply and\r\nhead becomes very simple. Merely ascertain the pressure of the water\r\nin the mains _when flowing_, determine the amount of power required\r\n(as illustrated in a succeeding chapter of this book), and install the\r\nproper water motor with a suitably sized pipe.\r\n\r\nWhere one has his own water supply, however, and it is necessary to\r\nlay pipe to secure the requisite fall, the problem is more difficult.\r\nFriction in pipes acts in the same way as cutting down the head a\r\nproportional amount; and by cutting down the head, your water motor\r\nloses power in direct proportion to the number of feet head lost. This\r\nhead, obtained by subtracting friction and other losses from the\r\nsurveyed head, is called the _effective head_, and determines the\r\namount of power delivered at the nozzle.\r\n\r\nThe tables on pages 66-67 show the friction loss in pipes up to 12\r\ninches in diameter, according to the amount of water, and the length\r\nof pipe.\r\n\r\nIn this example it is seen that a 240-foot static head is reduced by\r\nfriction to 230.1 feet effective head. By referring to the table we\r\nfind the wheel fitting these conditions has a nozzle so small that it\r\ncuts down the rate of flow of water in the big pipe to 4.4 feet a\r\nsecond, and permits the flow of only 207 cubic feet of water a minute.\r\nThe actual horsepower of this tube and nozzle, then, can be figured by\r\napplying formula (A), Chapter III, allowing 80 per cent for the\r\nefficiency of the wheel. Thus:\r\n\r\n  Actual horsepower =\r\n\r\n      207 × 230.1 × 62.5\r\n      ------------------ = 90.21 × .80 = 72.168 Hp.\r\n            33,000\r\n\r\nTo calculate what the horsepower of this tube 12 inches in diameter\r\nand 900 feet long, would be without a nozzle, under a head of 240\r\nfeet, introduces a new element of friction losses, which is too\r\ncomplicated to figure here. Such a condition would not be met with in\r\nactual practice, in any event. The largest nozzles used, even in the\r\njumbo plants of the Far West, rarely exceed 10 inches in diameter; and\r\nthe pipe conveying water to such a nozzle is upwards of eight feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PIPE FRICTION TABLES\r\n\r\n    INDICATING THE CALCULATED LOSS OF HEAD DUE TO FRICTION IN RIVETED\r\n    STEEL PIPE WITH VARIOUS WATER QUANTITIES AND VELOCITIES\r\n\r\n    [Courtesy of the Pelton Water Wheel Company]\r\n\r\n    Heavy-faced figures = Loss of head in feet for each one thousand\r\n    feet of pipe.

The heavy-faced figures above\r\n    207 indicate that the loss per 1000 feet of pipe length is 11 feet.\r\n    Therefore, since the pipe in the example is 900 feet long, the loss\r\n    will be\r\n\r\n    11.' × 900/1000 or 9.9 feet, and the effective head will be\r\n    240' - 9.9' = 230.1'\r\n\r\n\r\nSteel tubing for supply pipes, from 3 to 12 inches in diameter is\r\nlisted at from 20 cents to $1.50 a foot, according to the diameter and\r\nthickness of the material. Discounts on these prices will vary from 25\r\nto 50 per cent. The farmer can cut down the cost of this pipe by\r\nconveying his supply water from its natural source to a pond, by means\r\nof an open race, or a wooden flume. An ingenious mechanic can even\r\nconstruct his own pipe out of wood, though figuring labor and\r\nmaterials, it is doubtful if anything would be saved over a riveted\r\nsteel pipe, purchased at the regular price. This pipe, leading from\r\nthe pond, or forebay, to the water wheel, should be kept as short as\r\npossible; at the same time, the fall should not be too sharp. An angle\r\nof 30° will be found very satisfactory, although pipe is frequently\r\nlaid at angles up to 50°.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Types of Impulse Wheels_\r\n\r\nIn recent years more efficient forms of the old-fashioned overshoot,\r\npitch-back breast, and undershoot wheels have been developed, by\r\nsubstituting steel or other metal for wood, and altering the shape of\r\nthe buckets to make better use of the power of falling water.\r\n\r\nIn some forms of overshoot wheels, an efficiency of over 90 per cent\r\nis claimed by manufacturers; and this type offers the additional\r\nadvantage of utilizing small quantities of water, as well as being\r\nefficient under varying quantities of water. They utilize the falling\r\nweight of water, although by giving the water momentum at the point of\r\ndelivery, by means of the proper fall, impulse too is utilized in some\r\nmeasure. The modern steel overshoot wheel receives water in its\r\nbuckets from a spout set a few degrees back of dead center; and its\r\nbuckets are so shaped that the water is retained a full\r\nhalf-revolution of the wheel. The old-style overshoot wheel was\r\ninefficient principally because the buckets began emptying themselves\r\nat the end of a quarter-revolution. Another advantage claimed for\r\nthese wheels over the old style is that, being made of thin metal,\r\ntheir buckets attain the temperature of the water itself, thus\r\nreducing the danger of freezing to a minimum. They are manufactured in\r\nsizes from 6 feet in diameter to upwards of fifty feet; and with\r\nbuckets of from 6 inches to 10 feet in width. In practice it is usual\r\nto deliver water to the buckets by means of a trough or pipe, through\r\na suitable spout and gate, at a point two feet above the crown of the\r\nwheel. For this reason, the diameter of the wheel corresponds very\r\nclosely to the head in feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Reaction Turbine_\r\n\r\nThe reaction turbine is best adapted to low heads, with a large supply\r\nof water. It is not advisable, under ordinary circumstances, to use it\r\nunder heads exceeding 100 feet, as its speed is then excessive. It\r\nmay be used under falls as low as two feet. Five thousand cubic feet\r\nof water a minute would give approximately 14 actual horsepower under\r\nsuch a head. A sluggish creek that flows in large volume could thus be\r\nutilized for power with the reaction turbine, whereas it would be\r\nuseless with an impulse wheel. Falls of from five to fifteen feet are\r\nto be found on thousands of farm streams, and the reaction turbine is\r\nadmirably adapted to them.\r\n\r\nReaction turbines consist of an iron \"runner\" which is in effect a\r\nrotary fan, the pressure and momentum of the column of water pressing\r\non the slanted blades giving it motion and power. These wheels are\r\nmanufactured in a great variety of forms and sizes; and are to be\r\npurchased either as the runner (set in bearings) alone, or as a runner\r\nenclosed in an iron case. In case the runner alone is purchased, the\r\nowner must enclose it, either with iron or wood. They vary in price\r\naccording to size, and the means by which the flow of water is\r\ncontrolled. A simple 12-inch reaction turbine wheel, such as would be\r\nsuitable for many power plants can be had for $75. A twelve-inch\r\nwheel, using 18 or 20 square inches of water, would generate about\r\n7-1/2 horsepower under a 20-foot head, with 268 cubic feet of water a\r\nminute. Under a 30-foot head, and with 330 cubic feet of water such a\r\nwheel will give 14 horsepower. A 36-inch wheel, under a 5-foot head,\r\nwould use 2,000 cubic feet of water, and give 14 horsepower. Under a\r\n30-foot head, this same wheel, using 4,900 cubic feet of water a\r\nminute, would develop over 200 horsepower. If the farmer is confronted\r\nby the situation of a great deal of water and small head, a large\r\nwheel would be necessary. Thus he could secure 35 horsepower with only\r\na 3-foot head, providing his water supply is equal to the draft of\r\n8,300 cubic feet a minute.\r\n\r\nFrom these sample figures, it will be seen that the reaction turbine\r\nwill meet the requirements of widely varying conditions up to, say a\r\nhead of 100 feet. The farmer prospector should measure first the\r\nquantity of water to be depended on, and then the number of feet fall\r\nto be had. The higher the fall, with certain limits, the smaller the\r\nexpense of installation, and the less water required. When he has\r\ndetermined _quantity_ and _head_, the catalogue of a reputable\r\nmanufacturer will supply him with what information is necessary to\r\ndecide on the style and size wheel he should install. In the older\r\nsettled communities, especially in New England, a farmer should be\r\nable to pick up a second-hand turbine, at half the price asked for a\r\nnew one; and since these wheels do not depreciate rapidly, it would\r\nserve his purpose as well, in most cases, as a new one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical vertical turbine]\r\n\r\nReaction turbines may be either horizontal or vertical. If they are\r\nvertical, it is necessary to connect them to the main shaft by means\r\nof a set of bevel gears. These gears should be substantially large,\r\nand if the teeth are of hard wood (set in such a manner that they can\r\nbe replaced when worn) they will be found more satisfactory than if of\r\ncast or cut metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two wheels on a horizontal shaft\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of the C. P. Bradway Company, West Stafford, Conn.)]\r\n\r\nThe horizontal turbine is keyed to its shaft, like the impulse wheel,\r\nso that the wheel shaft itself is used for driving, without gears or a\r\nquarter-turn belt. (The latter is to be avoided, wherever possible.)\r\nThere are many forms of horizontal turbines; they are to be had of the\r\nduplex type, that is, two wheels on one shaft. These are arranged so\r\nthat either wheel may be run separately, or both together, thus\r\npermitting one to take advantage of the seasonal fluctuation in water\r\nsupply. A convenient form of these wheels includes draft tubes, by\r\nwhich the wheel may be set several feet above the tailrace, and the\r\nadvantage of this additional fall still be preserved. In this case the\r\ndraft tube must be airtight so as to form suction, when filled with\r\nescaping water, and should be proportioned to the size of the wheel.\r\nTheoretically these draft tubes might be 34 feet long, but in practice\r\nit has been found that they should not exceed 10 or 12 feet under\r\nordinary circumstances. They permit the wheel to be installed on the\r\nmain floor of the power station, with the escape below, instead of\r\nbeing set just above the tailrace level itself, as is the case when\r\ndraft tubes are not used.\r\n\r\nReaction turbines when working under a variable load require water\r\ngovernors (like impulse wheels) although where the supply of water is\r\nlarge, and the proportion of power between water wheel and dynamo is\r\nliberal--say two to one, or more--this necessity is greatly reduced.\r\nReaction wheels as a rule govern themselves better than impulse\r\nwheels, due both to the fact that they use more water, and that they\r\noperate in a small airtight case. The centrifugal ball governor is the\r\ntype usually used with reaction wheels as well as with impulse wheels.\r\nThis subject will be discussed more fully later.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Installing a Power Plant_\r\n\r\nIn developing a power prospect, the dam itself is usually not the site\r\nof the power plant. In fact, because of danger from flood water and\r\nice, it is better to locate it in a more protected spot, leading the\r\nwater to the wheel by means of a race and flume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bird's-eye view of a developed water-power plant]\r\n\r\nA typical crib dam, filled with stone, is shown in section in the\r\ndiagram, and the half-tone illustration shows such a dam in course of\r\nconstruction. The first bed of timbers should be laid on hard-pan or\r\nsolid rock in the bed of the stream parallel to its flow. The second\r\ncourse, across the stream, is then begun, being spiked home by means\r\nof rods cut to length and sharpened by the local blacksmith, from\r\n3/4-inch Norway iron. Hemlock logs are suitable for building the crib;\r\nand as the timbers are finally laid, it should be filled in and made\r\nsolid with boulders. This filling in should proceed section by\r\nsection, as the planking goes forward, otherwise there will be no\r\nescape for the water of the stream, until it rises and spills over\r\nthe top timbers. The planking should be of two-inch chestnut, spiked\r\nhome with 60 penny wire spikes. When the last section of the crib is\r\nfilled with boulders and the water rises, the remaining planks may be\r\nspiked home with the aid of an iron pipe in which to drive the spike\r\nby means of a plunger of iron long enough to reach above the level of\r\nthe water. When the planking is completed, the dam should be well\r\ngravelled, to within a foot or two of its crest. Such dams are\r\nsubstantial, easily made with the aid of unskilled labor, and the\r\nmaterials are to be had on the average farm with the exception of the\r\nhardware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross-section of a rock and timber dam]\r\n\r\nThis dam forms a pond from which the race draws its supply of water\r\nfor the wheel. It also serves as a spillway over which the surplus\r\nwater escapes. The race should enter the pond at some convenient\r\npoint, and should be protected at or near its point of entrance by a\r\nbulkhead containing a gate, so that the supply of water may be cut off\r\nfrom the race and wheel readily. The lay of the land will determine\r\nthe length and course of the race. The object of the race is to secure\r\nthe required head by carrying a portion of the available water to a\r\npoint where it can escape, by a fall of say 30° to the tailrace. It\r\nmay be feasible to carry the race in a line almost at right angles to\r\nthe stream itself, or, again, it may be necessary to parallel the\r\nstream. If the lay of the land is favorable, the race may be dug to a\r\ndistance of a rod or so inshore, and then be permitted to cut its own\r\ncourse along the bank, preventing the water escaping back to the river\r\nor brook before the site of the power plant is reached, by building\r\nsuitable retaining embankments. The race should be of ample size for\r\nconveying the water required without too much friction. It should end\r\nin a flume constructed stoutly of timbers. It is from this flume that\r\nthe penstock draws water for the wheel. When the wheel gate is closed\r\nthe water in the mill pond behind the dam, and in the flume itself\r\nshould maintain an approximate level. Any surplus flow is permitted to\r\nescape over flushboards in the flume; these same flushboards maintain\r\na constant head when the wheel is in operation by carrying off what\r\nlittle surplus water the race delivers from the pond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of bulkhead gate]\r\n\r\nAt some point in the race or flume, the flow should be protected from\r\nleaves and other trash by means of a rack. This rack is best made of\r\n1/4 or 1/2-inch battens from 1-1/2 to 3 inches in width, bolted\r\ntogether on their flat faces and separated a distance equal to the\r\nthickness of the battens by means of iron washers. This rack will\r\naccumulate leaves and trash, varying with the time of year and should\r\nbe kept clean, so as not to cut down the supply of water needed by the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThe penstock, or pipe conveying water from the flume to the wheel,\r\nshould be constructed of liberal size, and substantially, of two-inch\r\nchestnut planking, with joints caulked with oakum, and the whole well\r\nbound together to resist the pressure of the water. Means should be\r\nprovided near the bottom for an opening through which to remove any\r\nobstructions that may by accident pass by the rack. Many wheels have\r\nplates provided in their cases for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe tailrace should be provided with enough fall to carry the escaping\r\nwater back to the main stream, without backing up on the wheel itself\r\nand thus cutting down the head.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to make any estimates of the cost of such a\r\nwater-power plant. The labor required will in most instances be\r\nsupplied by the farmer himself, his sons, and his help, during times\r\nwhen farm operations are slack.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Water Rights of the Farmer_\r\n\r\nThe farmer owns the bed of every stream not navigable, lying within\r\nthe boundary lines of the farm; and his right to divert and make use\r\nof the water of such streams is determined in most states by common\r\nlaw. In the dry-land states where water is scarce and is valuable for\r\nirrigation, a special set of statutes has sprung up with the\r\ndevelopment of irrigation in this country.\r\n\r\nA stream on the farm is either public or private; its being navigable\r\nor \"floatable\" (suitable for floating logs) determining which. Water\r\nrights are termed in law \"riparian\" rights, and land is riparian only\r\nwhen water flows over it or along its borders.\r\n\r\nGreen (Law for the American Farmer) says:\r\n\r\n\"Water is the common and equal property of every one through whose\r\nland it flows, and the right of each land-owner to use and consume it\r\nwithout destroying, or unreasonably impairing the rights of others, is\r\nthe same. An owner of land bordering on a running stream has the right\r\nto have its waters flow naturally, and none can lawfully divert them\r\nwithout his consent. Each riparian proprietor has an equal right with\r\nall the others to have the stream flow in its natural way without\r\nsubstantial reduction in volume, or deterioration in quality, subject\r\nto a proper and reasonable use of its waters for domestic,\r\nagricultural and manufacturing purposes, and he is entitled to use it\r\nhimself for such purposes, but in doing so must not substantially\r\ninjure others. In addition to the right of drawing water for the\r\npurposes just mentioned, a riparian proprietor, if he duly regards the\r\nrights of others, and does not unreasonably deplete the supply, has\r\nalso the right to take the water for some other proper uses.\"\r\n\r\nThus, the farmer who seeks to develop water-power from a stream\r\nflowing across his own land, has the right to divert such a stream\r\nfrom its natural channel--providing it is not a navigable or floatable\r\nstream--but in so doing, he must return it to its own channel for\r\nlower riparian owners. The generation of water-power does not pollute\r\nthe water, nor does it diminish the water in quantity, therefore the\r\nfarmer is infringing on no other owner's rights in using the water for\r\nsuch a purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen a stream is a dividing line between two farms, as is frequently\r\nthe case, each proprietor owns to the middle of the stream and\r\ncontrols its banks. Therefore to erect a dam across such a private\r\nstream and divert all or a part of the water for power purposes,\r\nrequires the consent of the neighboring owner. The owner of the dam is\r\nresponsible for damage due to flooding, to upstream riparian owners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DYNAMO; WHAT IT DOES, AND HOW\r\n\r\n     Electricity compared to the heat and light of the Sun--The simple\r\n     dynamo--The amount of electric energy a dynamo will generate--The\r\n     modern dynamo--Measuring power in terms of electricity--The\r\n     volt--The ampere--The ohm--The watt and the kilowatt--Ohm's Law of\r\n     the electric circuit, and some examples of its application--Direct\r\n     current, and alternating current--Three types of direct-current\r\n     dynamos: series, shunt, and compound.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a farmer really does in generating electricity from water that\r\nwould otherwise run to waste in his brook, is to install a private Sun\r\nof his own--which is on duty not merely in daylight, but twenty-four\r\nhours a day; a private Sun which is under such simple control that it\r\nshines or provides heat and power, when and where wanted, simply by\r\ntouching a button.\r\n\r\nThis is not a mere fanciful statement. When you come to look into it\r\nyou find that electricity actually is the life-giving power of the\r\nSun's rays, so transformed that it can be handily conveyed from place\r\nto place by means of wires, and controlled by mechanical devices as\r\nsimple as the spigot that drains a cask.\r\n\r\nNature has the habit of traveling in circles. Sometimes these circles\r\nare so big that the part of them we see looks like a straight line,\r\nbut it is not. Even parallel lines, according to the mathematicians,\r\n\"meet in infinity.\" Take the instance of the water wheel which the\r\nfarmer has installed under the fall of his brook. The power which\r\nturns the wheel has the strength of many horses. It is there in a\r\nhandy place for use, because the Sun brought it there. The Sun, by its\r\nheat, lifted the water from sea-level, to the pond where we find\r\nit--and we cannot get any more power out of this water by means of a\r\nturbine using its pressure and momentum in falling, than the Sun\r\nitself expended in raising the water against the force of gravity.\r\n\r\nOnce we have installed the wheel to change the energy of falling water\r\ninto mechanical power, the task of the dynamo is to turn this\r\nmechanical power into another mode of motion--electricity. And the\r\ntask of electricity is to change this mode of motion back into the\r\noriginal heat and light of the Sun--which started the circle in the\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nAstronomers refer to the Sun as \"he\" and \"him\" and they spell his name\r\nwith a capital letter, to show that he occupies the center of our\r\nsmall neighborhood of the universe at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magnets and Magnetism_\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is a mechanical engine, like the steam engine, the water\r\nturbine or the gas engine; and it converts the mechanical motion of\r\nthe driven wheel into electrical motion, with the aid of a magnet.\r\nMany scientists say that the full circle of energy that keeps the\r\nworld spinning, grows crops, and paints the sky with the Aurora\r\nBorealis, begins and ends with magnetism--that the sun's rays are\r\nmagnetic rays. Magnetism is the force that keeps the compass needle\r\npointing north and south. Take a steel rod and hold it along the\r\nnorth and south line, slightly inclined towards the earth, and strike\r\nit a sharp blow with a hammer, and it becomes a magnet--feeble, it is\r\ntrue, but still a magnet.\r\n\r\nTake a wire connected with a common dry battery and hold a compass\r\nneedle under it and the needle will immediately turn around and point\r\ndirectly across the wire, showing that the wire possesses magnetism\r\nencircling it in invisible lines, stronger than the magnetism of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_Courtesy of the Crocker-Wheeler Company_)\r\n\r\nA direct-current dynamo or motor, showing details of construction]\r\n\r\nInsulate this wire by covering it with cotton thread, and wind it\r\nclosely on a spool. Connect the two loose ends to a dry battery, and\r\nyou will find that you have multiplied the magnetic strength of a\r\nsingle loop of wire by the number of turns on the spool--concentrated\r\nall the magnetism of the length of that wire into a small space. Put\r\nan iron core in the middle of this spool and the magnet seems still\r\nmore powerful. Lines of force which otherwise would escape in great\r\ncircles into space, are now concentrated in the iron. The iron core\r\nis a magnet. Shut off the current from the battery and the iron is\r\nstill a magnet--weak, true, but it will always retain a small portion\r\nof its magnetism. Soft iron retains very little of its magnetism. Hard\r\nsteel retains a great deal, and for this reason steel is used for\r\npermanent magnets, of the horseshoe type so familiar.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Simple Dynamo_\r\n\r\nA dynamo consists, first, of a number of such magnets, wound with\r\ninsulated wire. Their iron cores point towards the center of a circle\r\nlike the spokes of a wheel; and their curved inner faces form a circle\r\nin which a spool, wound with wire in another way, may be spun by the\r\nwater wheel.\r\n\r\nNow take a piece of copper wire and make a loop of it. Pass one side\r\nof this loop in front of an electric magnet.\r\n\r\nAs the wire you hold in your hands passes the iron face of the magnet,\r\na wave of energy that is called electricity flows around this loop at\r\nthe rate of 186,000 miles a second--the same speed as light comes to\r\nus from the sun. As you move the wire away from the magnet, a second\r\nwave starts through the wire, flowing in the opposite direction. You\r\ncan prove this by holding a compass needle under the wire and see it\r\nwag first in one direction, then in another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A wire \"cutting\" the lines of force of an\r\nelectro-magnet]\r\n\r\nThis is a simple dynamo. A wire \"cutting\" the invisible lines of\r\nforce, that a magnet is spraying out into the air, becomes\r\n\"electrified.\" Why this is true, no one has ever been able to explain.\r\n\r\nThe amount of electricity--its capacity for work--which you have\r\ngenerated with the magnet and wire, does not depend alone on the\r\npulling power of that simple magnet. Let us say the magnet is very\r\nweak--has not enough power to lift one ounce of iron. Nevertheless,\r\nif you possessed the strength of Hercules, and could pass that wire\r\nthrough the field of force of the magnet many thousands of times a\r\nsecond, you would generate enough electricity in the wire to cause the\r\nwire to melt in your hands from heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross-section of an armature revolving in its field]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forms of annealed steel discs used in armature\r\nconstruction]\r\n\r\nThis experiment gives the theory of the dynamo. Instead of passing\r\nonly one wire through the field of force of a magnet, we have hundreds\r\nbound lengthwise on a revolving drum called an armature. Instead of\r\none magnetic pole in a dynamo we have two, or four, or twenty\r\naccording to the work the machine is designed for--always in pairs, a\r\nNorth pole next to a South pole, so that the lines of force may flow\r\nout of one and into another, instead of escaping in the surrounding\r\nair. If you could see these lines of force, they would appear in\r\ncountless numbers issuing from each pole face of the field magnets,\r\npressing against the revolving drum like hair brush bristles--trying\r\nto hold it back. This drum, in practice, is built up of discs of\r\nannealed steel, and the wires extending lengthwise on its face are\r\nheld in place by slots to prevent them from flying off when the drum\r\nis whirled at high speed. The drum does not touch the face of the\r\nmagnets, but revolves in an air space. If we give the electric\r\nimpulses generated in these wires a chance to flow in a circuit--flow\r\nout of one end of the wires, and in at the other, the drum will\r\nrequire more and more power to turn it, in proportion to the amount of\r\nelectricity we permit to flow. Thus, if one electric light is turned\r\non, the drum will press back with a certain strength on the water\r\nwheel; if one hundred lights are turned on it will press back one\r\nhundred times as much. Providing there is enough power in the water\r\nwheel to continue turning the drum at its predetermined speed, the\r\ndynamo will keep on giving more and more electricity if asked to,\r\nuntil it finally destroys itself by fire. You cannot take more power,\r\nin terms of electricity, out of a dynamo that you put into it, in\r\nterms of mechanical motion. In fact, to insure flexibility and\r\nconstant speed at all loads, it is customary to provide twice as much\r\nwater wheel, or engine, power as the electrical rating of the dynamo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An armature partly wound, showing slots and commutator]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that a water wheel is 85 per cent efficient under ideal\r\nconditions. A dynamo's efficiency in translating mechanical motion\r\ninto electricity, varies with the type of machine and its size. The\r\nlargest machines attain as high as 90 per cent efficiency; the\r\nsmallest ones run as low as 40 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measuring Electric Power_\r\n\r\nThe amount of electricity any given dynamo can generate depends,\r\ngenerally speaking, on two factors, i. e., (1) the power of the water\r\nwheel, or other mechanical engine that turns the armature; and (2) the\r\nsize (carrying capacity) of the wires on this drum.\r\n\r\nStrength, of electricity, is measured in _amperes_. An ampere of\r\nelectricity is the unit of the rate of flow and may be likened to a\r\ngallon of water per minute.\r\n\r\nIn surveying for water-power, in Chapter III, we found that the\r\nnumber of gallons or cubic feet of water alone did not determine the\r\namount of power. We found that the number of gallons or cubic feet\r\nmultiplied by the distance in feet it falls in a given time, was the\r\ndetermining factor--pounds (quantity) multiplied by feet per\r\nsecond--(velocity).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing the analogy of water to volts and amperes of\r\nelectricity]\r\n\r\nThe same is true in figuring the power of electricity. We multiply the\r\n_amperes_ by the number of electric impulses that are created in the\r\nwire in the course of one second. The unit of velocity, or pressure of\r\nthe electric current is called a _volt_. Voltage is the pressure which\r\ncauses electricity to flow. A volt may be likened to the velocity in\r\nfeet per second of water in falling past a certain point. If you\r\nthink a moment you will see that this has nothing to do with quantity.\r\nA pin-hole stream of water under 40 pounds pressure has the same\r\nvelocity as water coming from a nozzle as big as a barrel, under the\r\nsame pressure. So with electricity under the pressure of one volt or\r\none hundred volts.\r\n\r\nOne volt is said to consist of a succession of impulses caused by _one\r\nwire cutting 100,000,000 lines of magnetic force in one second_. Thus,\r\nif the strength of a magnet consisted of one line of force, to create\r\nthe pressure of one volt we would have to \"cut\" that line of force\r\n100,000,000 times a second, with one wire; or 100,000 times a second\r\nwith one thousand wires. Or, if a magnet could be made with\r\n100,000,000 lines of force, a single wire cutting those lines once in\r\na second would create one volt pressure. In actual practice, field\r\nmagnets of dynamos are worked at densities up to and over 100,000\r\nlines of force to the square inch, and armatures contain several\r\nhundred conductors to \"cut\" these magnetic lines. The voltage then\r\ndepends on the speed at which the armature is driven. In machines for\r\nisolated plants, it will be found that the speed varies from 400\r\nrevolutions per minute, to 1,800, according to the design of dynamo\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pressure determines volume of flow in a given time]\r\n\r\nMultiplying amperes (strength) by volts (pressure), gives us _watts_\r\n(power). Seven hundred and forty-six watts of electrical energy is\r\nequal to one horsepower of mechanical energy--will do the same work.\r\nThus an electric current under a pressure of 100 volts, and a density\r\nof 7.46 amperes, is one horsepower; as is 74.6 amperes, at 10 volts\r\npressure; or 746 amperes at one volt pressure. For convenience (as a\r\nwatt is a small quantity) electricity is measured in _kilowatts_, or\r\n1,000 watts. Since 746 watts is one horsepower, 1,000 watts or one\r\nkilowatt is 1.34 horsepower. The work of such a current for one hour\r\nis called a _kilowatt-hour_, and in our cities, where electricity is\r\ngenerated from steam, the retail price of a kilowatt-hour varies from\r\n10 to 15 cents.\r\n\r\nNow as to how electricity may be controlled, so that a dynamo will not\r\nburn itself up when it begins to generate.\r\n\r\nAgain we come back to the analogy of water. The amount of water that\r\npasses through a pipe in any given time, depends on the size of the\r\npipe, if the pressure is maintained uniform. In other words the\r\n_resistance_ of the pipe to the flow of water determines the amount.\r\nIf the pipe be the size of a pin-hole, a very small amount of water\r\nwill escape. If the pipe is as big around as a barrel, a large amount\r\nwill force its way through. So with electricity. Resistance,\r\nintroduced in the electric circuit, controls the amount of current\r\nthat flows. A wire as fine as a hair will permit only a small quantity\r\nto pass, under a given pressure. A wire as big as one's thumb will\r\npermit a correspondingly greater quantity to pass, the pressure\r\nremaining the same. The unit of electrical resistance is called the\r\n_ohm_--named after a man, as are all electrical units.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ohm's Law_\r\n\r\nThe _ohm_ is that amount of _resistance_ that will permit the passage\r\nof _one ampere_, under the pressure of _one volt_. It would take two\r\nvolts to force two amperes through one ohm; or 100 volts to force 100\r\namperes through the resistance of one ohm. From this we have Ohm's\r\nLaw, a simple formula which is the beginning and end of all electric\r\ncomputations the farmer will have to make in installing his\r\nwater-power electric plant. Ohm's Law tells us that the density of\r\ncurrent (amperes) that can pass through a given resistance in ohms (a\r\nwire, a lamp, or an electric stove) equals _volts_ divided by\r\n_ohms_--or _pressure_ divided by _resistance_. This formula may be\r\nwritten in three ways, thus:\r\n\r\nC = E/R, or R = E/C or, E = C × R. Or to express the same thing in\r\nwords, _current_ equals _volts_ divided by _ohms_; _ohms_ equals\r\n_volts_ divided by _current_; or _volts_ equals _current_ multiplied\r\nby _ohms_. So, with any two of these three determining factors known,\r\nwe can find the third. As we have said, this simple law is the\r\nbeginning and end of ordinary calculations as to electric current, and\r\nit should be thoroughly understood by any farmer who essays to be his\r\nown electrical engineer. Once understood and applied, the problem of\r\nthe control of the electric current becomes simple a b c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Examples of Ohm's Law_\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate its application by an example. The water wheel is\r\nstarted and is spinning the dynamo at its rated speed, say 1,500\r\nr.p.m. Two heavy wires, leading from brushes which collect electricity\r\nfrom the revolving armature, are led, by suitable insulated supports\r\nto the switchboard, and fastened there. They do not touch each other.\r\nDynamo mains must not be permitted to touch each other _under any\r\nconditions_. They are separated by say four inches of air. Dry air is\r\na very poor conductor of electricity. Let us say, for the example,\r\nthat dry air has a resistance to the flow of an electric current, of\r\n1,000,000 ohms to the inch--that would be 4,000,000 ohms. How much\r\nelectricity is being permitted to escape from the armature of this\r\n110-volt dynamo, when the mains are separated by four inches of dry\r\nair? Apply Ohm's law, C equals E divided by R. E, in this case is 110;\r\nR is 4,000,000; therefore C (amperes) equals 110/4,000,000--an\r\ninfinitesimal amount--about .0000277 ampere.\r\n\r\nLet us say that instead of separating these two mains by air we\r\nseparated them by the human body--that a man took hold of the bare\r\nwires, one in each hand. The resistance of the human body varies from\r\n5,000 to 10,000 ohms. In that case C (amperes) equals 110/5,000, or\r\n110/10,000--about 1/50th, or 1/100th of an ampere. This illustrates\r\nwhy an electric current of 110 volts pressure is not fatal to human\r\nbeings, under ordinary circumstances. The body offers too much\r\nresistance. But, if the volts were 1,100 instead of the usual 110 used\r\nin commercial and private plants for domestic use, the value of C, by\r\nthis formula at 5,000 ohms, would be nearly 1/5th ampere. To drive\r\n1/5th ampere of electricity through the human body would be fatal in\r\nmany instances. The higher the voltage, the more dangerous the\r\ncurrent. In large water-power installations in the Far West, where the\r\ncurrent must be transmitted over long distances to the spot where it\r\nis to be used, it is occasionally generated at a pressure of 150,000\r\nvolts. Needless to say, contact with such wires means instant death.\r\nBefore being used for commercial or domestic purposes, in such cases,\r\nthe voltage is \"stepped down\" to safe pressures--to 110, or to 220, or\r\nto 550 volts--always depending on the use made of it.\r\n\r\nNow, if instead of interposing four inches of air, or the human body,\r\nbetween the mains of our 110-volt dynamo, we connected an incandescent\r\nlamp across the mains, how much electricity would flow from the\r\ngenerator? An incandescent lamp consists of a vacuum bulb of glass, in\r\nwhich is mounted a slender thread of carbonized fibre, or fine\r\ntungsten wire. To complete a circuit, the current must flow through\r\nthis wire or filament. In flowing through it, the electric current\r\nturns the wire or filament white hot--incandescent--and thus turns\r\nelectricity back into light, with a small loss in heat. In an ordinary\r\n16 candlepower carbon lamp, the resistance of this filament is 220\r\nohms. Therefore the amount of current that a 110-volt generator can\r\nforce through that filament is 110/220, or 1/2 ampere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Armature and field coils of a direct current dynamo]\r\n\r\nOne hundred lamps would provide 100 paths of 220 ohms resistance each\r\nto carry current, and the amount required to light 100 such lamps\r\nwould be 100 × 1/2 or 50 amperes. Every electrical device--a lamp, a\r\nstove, an iron, a motor, etc.,--must, by regulations of the Fire\r\nUnderwriters' Board be plainly marked with the voltage of the current\r\nfor which it is designed and the amount of current it will consume.\r\nThis is usually done by indicating its capacity in watts, which as we\r\nhave seen, means volts times amperes, and from this one can figure\r\nohms, by the above formulas.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Short Circuit_\r\n\r\nWe said a few paragraphs back that under no conditions must two bare\r\nwires leading from electric mains be permitted to touch each other,\r\nwithout some form of resistance being interposed in the form of lamps,\r\nor other devices. Let us see what would happen if two such bare wires\r\ndid touch each other. Our dynamo as we discover by reading its plate,\r\nis rated to deliver 50 amperes, let us say, at 110 volts pressure.\r\nModern dynamos are rated liberally, and can stand 100% overload for\r\nshort periods of time, without dangerous overheating. Let us say that\r\nthe mains conveying current from the armature to the switchboard are\r\nfive feet long, and of No. 2 B. & S. gauge copper wire, a size which\r\nwill carry 50 amperes without heating appreciably. The resistance of\r\nthis 10 feet of No. 2 copper wire, is, as we find by consulting a wire\r\ntable, .001560 ohms. If we touch the ends of these two five-foot wires\r\ntogether, we instantly open a clear path for the flow of electric\r\ncurrent, limited only by the carrying capacity of the wire and the\r\nback pressure of .001560 ohms resistance. Using Ohm's Law, C equals E\r\ndivided by R, we find that C (amperes) equals 110/.001560 or _70,515\r\namperes_!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A direct current dynamo]\r\n\r\nUnless this dynamo were properly protected, the effect of such a\r\ncatastrophe would be immediate and probably irreparable. In effect, it\r\nwould be suddenly exerting a force of nearly 10,000 horsepower against\r\nthe little 10 horsepower water wheel that is driving this dynamo. The\r\nmildest thing that could happen would be to melt the feed-wire or to\r\nsnap the driving belt, in which latter case the dynamo would come to a\r\nstop. If by any chance the little water wheel was given a chance to\r\nmaintain itself against the blow for an instant, the dynamo, rated at\r\n50 amperes, would do its best to deliver the 70,515 amperes you called\r\nfor--and the result would be a puff of smoke, and a ruined dynamo.\r\nThis is called a \"short circuit\"--one of the first \"don'ts\" in\r\nhandling electricity.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact every dynamo is protected against such a calamity\r\nby means of safety devices, which will be described in a later\r\nchapter--because no matter how careful a person may be, a partial\r\nshort circuit is apt to occur. Happily, guarding against its\r\ndisastrous effects is one of the simplest problems in connection with\r\nthe electric plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Direct Current and Alternating Current_\r\n\r\nWhen one has mastered the simple Ohm's Law of the electric circuit,\r\nthe next step is to determine what type of electrical generator is\r\nbest suited to the requirements of a farm plant.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, electric current is divided into two classes of\r\ninterest here--_alternating_, and _direct_.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that when a wire is moved through the field of a magnet,\r\nthere is induced in it two pulsations--first in one direction, then in\r\nanother. This is an _alternating_ current, so called because it\r\nchanges its direction. If, with our armature containing hundreds of\r\nwires to \"cut\" the lines of force of a group of magnets, we connected\r\nthe beginning of each wire with one copper ring, and the end of each\r\nwire with another copper ring, we would have what is called an\r\n_alternating-current_ dynamo. Simply by pressing a strap of flexible\r\ncopper against each revolving copper ring, we would gather the sum of\r\nthe current of these conductors. Its course would be represented by\r\nthe curved line in the diagram, one loop on each side of the middle\r\nline (which represents time) would be a _cycle_. The number of\r\n_cycles_ to the second depends on the speed of the armature; in\r\nordinary practice it is usually twenty-five or sixty. Alternating\r\ncurrent has many advantages, which however, do not concern us here.\r\nExcept under very rare conditions, a farmer installing his own plant\r\nshould not use this type of machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of alternating and direct current]\r\n\r\nIf, however, instead of gathering all the current with brushes bearing\r\non two copper rings, we collected all the current traveling in one\r\ndirection, on one set of brushes--and all the current traveling in the\r\nother direction on another set of brushes,--we would straighten out\r\nthis current, make it all travel in one direction. Then we would have\r\na _direct current_. A direct current dynamo, the type generally used\r\nin private plants, does this. Instead of having two copper rings for\r\ncollecting the current, it has a single ring, made up of segments of\r\ncopper bound together, but insulated from each other, one segment for\r\neach set of conductors on the armature. This ring of many segments, is\r\ncalled a _commutator_, because it commutates, or changes, the\r\ndirection of the electric impulses, and delivers them all in one\r\ndirection. In effect, it is like the connecting rod of a steam engine\r\nthat straightens out the back-and-forth motion of the piston in the\r\nsteam cylinder and delivers the motion to a wheel running in one\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nSuch a current, flowing through a coil of wire would make a magnet,\r\none end of which would always be the north end, and the other end the\r\nsouth end. An alternating current, on the other hand, flowing through\r\na coil of wire, would make a magnet that changed its poles with each\r\nhalf-cycle. It would no sooner begin to pull another magnet to it,\r\nthan it would change about and push the other magnet away from it, and\r\nso on, as long as it continued to flow. This is one reason why a\r\ndirect current dynamo is used for small plants. Alternating current\r\nwill light the same lamps and heat the same irons as a direct current;\r\nbut for electric power it requires a different type of motor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Types of Direct Current Dynamos_\r\n\r\nJust as electrical generators are divided into two classes,\r\nalternating and direct, so direct current machines are divided into\r\nthree classes, according to the manner in which their output, in\r\namperes and volts, is regulated. They differ as to the manner in which\r\ntheir field magnets (in whose field of force the armature spins) are\r\nexcited, or made magnetic. They are called _series_, _shunt_, and\r\n_compound_ machines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Series Dynamo_\r\n\r\nBy referring to the diagram, it will be seen that the current of a\r\n_series_ dynamo issues from the armature mains, and passes through the\r\ncoils of the field magnets before passing into the external circuit to\r\ndo its work. The residual magnetism, or the magnetism left in the\r\niron cores of the field magnets from its last charge, provides the\r\ninitial excitation, when the machine is started. As the resistance of\r\nthe external circuit is lowered, by turning on more and more lights,\r\nmore and more current flows from the armature, through the field\r\nmagnets. Each time the resistance is lowered, therefore, the current\r\npassing through the field magnets becomes more dense in amperes, and\r\nmakes the field magnets correspondingly stronger.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the voltage depends on the number of lines of\r\nmagnetic force cut by the armature conductors in a given time. If the\r\nspeed remains constant then, and the magnets grow stronger and\r\nstronger, the voltage will rise in a straight line. When no current is\r\ndrawn, it is 0; at full load, it may be 100 volts, or 500, or 1,000\r\naccording to the machine. This type of machine is used only in street\r\nlighting, in cities, with the lights connected in \"series,\" or one\r\nafter another on the same wire, the last lamp finally returning the\r\nwire to the machine to complete the circuit. This type of dynamo has\r\ngained the name for itself of \"mankiller,\" as its voltage becomes\r\nenormous at full load. It is unsuitable, in every respect, for the\r\nfarm plant. Its field coils consist of a few turns of very heavy wire,\r\nenough to carry all the current of the external circuit, without\r\nheating.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connections of a series dynamo]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Shunt Dynamo_\r\n\r\nThe shunt dynamo, on the other hand, has field coils connected\r\ndirectly _across_ the circuit, from one wire to another, instead of in\r\n\"series.\" These coils consist of a great many turns of very fine wire,\r\nthus introducing _resistance_ into the circuit, which limits the\r\namount of current (amperes) that can be forced through them at any\r\ngiven voltage. As a shunt dynamo is brought up to its rated speed, its\r\nvoltage gradually rises until a condition of balance occurs between\r\nthe field coils and the armature. There it remains constant. When\r\nresistance on the external circuit is lowered, by means of turning on\r\nlamps or other devices, the current from the armature increases in\r\nworking power, by increasing its amperes. Its voltage remains\r\nstationary; and, since the resistance of its field coils never\r\nchanges, the magnets do not vary in strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connections of a shunt dynamo]\r\n\r\nThe objection to this type of machine for a farm plant is that, in\r\npractice, the armature begins to exercise a de-magnetizing effect on\r\nthe field magnets after a certain point is reached--weakens them;\r\nconsequently the voltage begins to fall. The voltage of a shunt dynamo\r\nbegins to fall after half-load is reached; and at full load, it has\r\nfallen possibly 20 per cent. A rheostat, or resistance box on the\r\nswitchboard, makes it possible to cut out or switch in additional\r\nresistance in the field coils, thus varying the strength of the field\r\ncoils, within a limit of say 15 per cent, to keep the voltage\r\nconstant. This, however, requires a constant attendance on the\r\nmachine. If the voltage were set right for 10 lights, the lights would\r\ngrow dim when 50 lights were turned on; and if it were adjusted for 50\r\nlights, the voltage would be too high for only ten lights--would cause\r\nthem to \"burn out.\"\r\n\r\nShunt dynamos are used for charging storage batteries, and are\r\nsatisfactory for direct service only when an attendant is constantly\r\nat hand to regulate them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Compound Dynamo_\r\n\r\nThe ideal between these two conditions would be a compromise, which\r\nincluded the characteristics of both _series_ and _shunt_ effects.\r\nThat is exactly what the _compound_ dynamo effects.\r\n\r\nA compound dynamo is a shunt dynamo with just enough series turns on\r\nits field coils, to counteract the de-magnetizing effect of the\r\narmature at full load. A machine can be designed to make the voltage\r\nrise gradually, or swiftly, by combining the two systems. For country\r\nhomes, the best combination is a machine that will keep the voltage\r\nconstant from no load to full load. A so-called _flat-compounded_\r\nmachine does this. In actual practice, this voltage rises slightly at\r\nthe half-load line--only two or three volts, which will not damage the\r\nlamps in a 110-volt circuit.\r\n\r\nThe compound dynamo is therefore self-regulating, and requires no\r\nattention, except as to lubrication, and the incidental care given to\r\nany piece of machinery. Any shunt dynamo can be made into a compound\r\ndynamo, by winding a few turns of heavy insulated wire around the\r\nshunt coils, and connecting them in \"series\" with the external\r\ncircuit. How many turns are necessary depends on conditions. Three or\r\nfour turns to each coil usually are sufficient for \"flat compounding.\"\r\nIf the generating plant is a long distance from the farm house where\r\nthe light, heat, and power are to be used, the voltage drops at full\r\nload, due to resistance of the transmission wires. To overcome this,\r\nenough turns can be wound on top of the shunt coils to cause the\r\nvoltage to rise at the switchboard, but remain stationary at the spot\r\nwhere the current is used. The usual so-called flat-compounded dynamo,\r\nturned out by manufacturers, provides for constant voltage at the\r\nswitchboard. Such a dynamo is eminently fitted for the farm electric\r\nplant. Any other type of machine is bound to cause constant trouble\r\nand annoyance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connections of a compound dynamo]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nWHAT SIZE PLANT TO INSTALL\r\n\r\n     The farmer's wife his partner--Little and big plants--Limiting\r\n     factors--Fluctuations in water supply--The average plant--The\r\n     actual plant--Amount of current required for various\r\n     operations--Standard voltage--A specimen allowance for electric\r\n     light--Heating and cooking by electricity--Electric power: the\r\n     electric motor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe farmer's wife becomes his partner when he has concluded the\r\npreliminary measurements and surveys for building his water-power\r\nelectric plant. Now the question is, how big a plant is necessary, or\r\nhow small a plant can he get along with. Electricity may be used for a\r\nmultitude of purposes on the farm, in its sphere of furnishing\r\nportable light, heat and power; but when this multitude of uses has\r\nbeen enumerated, it will be found that the wife shares in the benefits\r\nno less than the farmer himself. The greatest dividend of all,\r\nwhether dividends are counted in dollars or happiness, is that\r\nelectricity takes the drudgery out of housework. Here, the work of the\r\nfarmer himself ends when he has brought electricity to the house, just\r\nas his share in housework ends when he has brought in the kerosene,\r\nand filled the woodbox. Of the light and heat, she will use the lion's\r\nshare; and for the power, she will discover heretofore undreamed-of\r\nuses. So she must be a full partner when it comes to deciding how much\r\nelectricity they need.\r\n\r\nHow much electricity, in terms of light, heat, and power, will the\r\nfarmer and his wife have use for? How big a plant should be installed\r\nto meet the needs of keeping house and running the farm?\r\n\r\nThe answer hangs mainly on how much water-power there is available,\r\nthrough all the seasons of the year, with which to generate\r\nelectricity. Beyond that, it is merely a question of the farmer's\r\npocketbook. How much money does he care to spend? Electricity is a\r\ncumulative \"poison.\" The more one uses it, the more he wants to use\r\nit. After a plant has been in operation a year, the family have\r\ndiscovered uses for electricity which they did not think of in the\r\nbeginning. For this reason, it is well to put in a plant larger than\r\nthe needs of the moment seem to require. An electrical horsepower or\r\ntwo one way or another will not greatly change the first cost, and you\r\nwill always find use for any excess.\r\n\r\nOnce for all, to settle the question of water-power, the water wheel\r\nshould be twice the normal capacity of the dynamo it drives, in terms\r\nof power. This allows for overload, which is bound to occur\r\noccasionally; and it also insures smooth running, easy governing, and\r\nthe highest efficiency. Since the electric current, once the plant is\r\ninstalled, will cost practically nothing, the farmer can afford to\r\nignore the power going to waste, and consider only how to get the best\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Two Extremes_\r\n\r\nThe amount of water to be had to be turned into electricity, will vary\r\nwith location, and with the season. It may be only enough, the\r\ngreater part of the year, for a \"toy\" plant--a very practical toy, by\r\nthe way--one that will keep half a dozen lights burning in the house\r\nand barn at one time; under some conditions water may be so scarce\r\nthat it must be stored for three or four days to get enough power to\r\ncharge a storage battery for these six or eight lights. A one-quarter,\r\nor a one-half kilowatt electrical generator, with a one horsepower (or\r\nsmaller) wheel, will light a farmstead very satisfactorily--much\r\nbetter than kerosene lamps.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the driving power of your wheel may be sufficient\r\nto furnish 50 or 100 lights for the house, barn, and out-buildings,\r\nand barn-yard and drives; to provide ample current for irons,\r\ntoasters, vacuum cleaners, electric fans, etc.; to do all the cooking\r\nand baking and keep the kitchen boiler hot; and to heat the house in\r\nthe coldest weather with a dry clean heat that does not vitiate the\r\nair, with no ashes, smoke or dust or woodchopping--nothing but an\r\nelectric switch to turn on and off; and to provide power for motors\r\nranging from tiny ones to run the sewing machine, to one of 15\r\nhorsepower to do the threshing. A plant capable of developing from 30\r\nto 50 kilowatts of electricity, and requiring from 50 to 100\r\nhorsepower at the water wheel, would do all this, depending on the\r\nsize of the farmstead. One hundred horsepower is a very small water\r\nproject, in a commercial way; and there are thousands of farms\r\npossessing streams of this capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fluctuations in Water Supply_\r\n\r\nIt would be only during the winter months that such a plant would be\r\ndriven to its full capacity; and since water is normally plentiful\r\nduring these months, the problem of power would be greatly simplified.\r\nThe heaviest draft on such a plant in summer would be during\r\nharvesting; otherwise it would be confined to light, small power for\r\nroutine work, and cooking. Thus, a plant capable of meeting all the\r\nordinary requirements of the four dry months of summer, when water is\r\napt to be scarce, doubles or quadruples its capacity during the\r\nwinter months, to meet the necessities of heat for the house.\r\n\r\nA dynamo requires only as much power to drive it, at any given time,\r\nas is being used in terms of electricity. There is some small loss\r\nthrough friction, of course, but aside from this the power required of\r\nthe prime mover (the water wheel) is always in proportion to the\r\namount of current flowing. When water is scarce, and the demands for\r\ncurrent for heating are low, it is good practice to close a portion of\r\nthe buckets of the turbine wheel with wooden blocks provided for this\r\npurpose. It is necessary to keep the speed of the dynamo uniform under\r\nall water conditions; and where there is a great fluctuation between\r\nhigh and low water periods, it is frequently necessary to have a\r\nseparate set of pulleys for full gate and for half-gate. The head must\r\nremain the same, under all conditions. Changing the gate is in effect\r\nchoking or opening the nozzle supplying the wheel, to cut down or\r\nincrease its consumption of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Average Plant_\r\n\r\nIt will be the exceptional plant, however, among the hundreds of\r\nthousands to be had on our farms, which will banish not only the oil\r\nlamp and kitchen stove, but all coal or wood burning stoves as\r\nwell--which will heat the house in below-zero weather, and provide\r\npower for the heavier operations of the farm. Also, on the other hand,\r\nit will be the exceptional plant whose capacity is limited to\r\nfurnishing a half-dozen lights and no more.\r\n\r\nA happy medium between these two conditions is the plant large enough\r\nto supply between five and ten electrical horsepower, in all seasons.\r\nSuch a plant will meet the needs of the average farm, outside of\r\nwinter heating and large power operations, and will provide an excess\r\non which to draw in emergencies, or to pass round to one's neighbors.\r\nIt is such a plant that we refer to when we say that (not counting\r\nlabor) its cost, under ordinary conditions should not greatly exceed\r\nthe price of one sound young horse for farm work.\r\n\r\nSince the plant we described briefly in the first chapter, meets the\r\nrequirements of this \"average plant\" let us inquire a little more\r\nfully into its installation, maintenance, and cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Actual Plant_\r\n\r\nIn this instance, the water-power was already installed, running to\r\nwaste, in fact. The wheel consists of the so-called thirty-six inch\r\nvertical turbine, using 185 square inches of water, under a 14-foot\r\nhead. Water is supplied to this wheel by a wooden penstock 33 inches\r\nsquare, inside measurements, and sloping at an angle of 30° from the\r\nflume to the wheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of voltmeter or ammeter]\r\n\r\nThis wheel, under a 14-foot head, takes 2,312 cubic feet of water a\r\nminute; and it develops 46.98 actual horsepower (as may be figured by\r\nusing the formulas of Chapter III). The water supply is provided by a\r\nsmall mountain river. The dam is 10 feet high, and the race, which\r\nfeeds the flume from the mill pond is 75 yards long. The race has two\r\nspillways, one near the dam, and the second at the flume itself, to\r\nmaintain an even head of water at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Half-Gate_\r\n\r\nSince the water supply varies with the seasons, it has been found\r\npractical to run the wheel at half-gate--that is, with the gate only\r\nhalf-open. A set of bevel gears work the main shaft, which runs at\r\napproximately 200 revolutions per minute; and the dynamo is worked up\r\nto its required speed of 1,500 revolutions per minute through a\r\ncountershaft.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is a modern four-pole machine, compound-wound, with a rated\r\noutput of 46 amperes, at 125 volts--in other words a dynamo of 5.75\r\nkilowatts capacity, or 7.7 electrical horsepower. At full load this\r\ndynamo would require a driving power of 10 horsepower, counting it as\r\n75 per cent efficient; and, to conform to our rule of two water\r\nhorsepower to one electrical horsepower, the wheel should be capable\r\nof developing 20 horsepower. As a matter of fact, in this particular\r\ninstance, shutting down the wheel to half-gate more than halves the\r\nrated power of the wheel, and little more than 15 horsepower is\r\navailable. This allowance has proved ample, under all conditions met\r\nwith, in this plant.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is mounted on a firm floor foundation; and it is belted\r\nfrom the countershaft by an endless belt running diagonally. A\r\nhorizontal belt drive is the best. Vertical drive should be avoided\r\nwherever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Switchboard_\r\n\r\nThe switchboard originally consisted of a wooden frame on which were\r\nscrewed ordinary asbestos shingles, and the instruments were mounted\r\non these. Later, a sheet of electric insulating fibre was substituted,\r\nfor look's sake. The main requisite is something substantial--and\r\nfireproof. The switchboard instruments consist of a voltmeter, with a\r\nrange of from 0 to 150 volts; an ammeter, with a range, 0 to 75\r\namperes; a field regulating rheostat (which came with the dynamo); a\r\nmain switch, with cartridge fuses protecting the machine against a\r\ndraft of current over 60 amperes; and two line switches for the two\r\nowners, one fuse at 20 amperes, and the other at 40 amperes. Electric\r\nfuses are either cartridges or plugs, enclosing lead wire of a size\r\ncorresponding to their rating. All the current of the line they\r\nprotect passes through this lead wire. If the current drawn exceeds\r\nthe capacity of the lead wire, it melts from the heat, and thus opens\r\nthe circuit, and cuts off the current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A switchboard and its connections: _G._ Dynamo; _A._\r\nShunt field coils; _B._ Series coils; _DD._ Fuses; _FF._ Main switch;\r\n_F._ Field switch; _C._ Ammeter; _V._ Voltmeter; _E._ Lamp; _R._\r\nRheostat. Dotted lines show connections on back of board]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Items of Cost_\r\n\r\nThis water wheel would cost $250 new. There is a duplicate in the\r\nneighborhood bought at second-hand, for $125. The dynamo cost $90,\r\nand was picked up second-hand in New York City. New it would cost\r\n$150. The voltmeter cost $7, and the ammeter $10; and the switches and\r\nfuses could be had for $5. A wheel one-half the size, using one-half\r\nthe amount of water at full gate, would do the work required, and the\r\ncost would be correspondingly less.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capacity_\r\n\r\nThis plant supplies two farms with electric light. One farm (that of\r\nthe owner of the wheel) has 30 lamps, of 16 candlepower each, and two\r\nbarn-yard lamps of 92 candlepower each. His wife has an electric iron\r\nand an electric water heater. Needless to say, all these lamps, and\r\nthe iron and water heater are not in use at one time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carbon Lamps Gem Type (1/4 scale)]\r\n\r\nThe partner who owns the electric part of the plant has 30 lamps in\r\nhis house and barn, many of them being 25 watt tungsten, which give\r\nmore light for less power, but cost more to buy. They are not all in\r\nuse at one time, though (since the current costs nothing) the\r\ninclination is to turn them on at night and let them burn. In his\r\nkitchen he has an electric range, and a water heater for the 40 gallon\r\nboiler. In addition to this he has all sorts of appliances,--irons,\r\ntoasters, grills, a vacuum cleaner, a vibrator, etc. Naturally all\r\nthese appliances are not in use at one time, else the draft on the\r\nplant would be such as to \"blow\" the fuses. For instance, all the\r\nbaking is done in daylight; and when the oven is used after dark, they\r\nare careful to turn off all lights not needed. An ideal plant, of\r\ncourse, would be a plant big enough to take care of the sum of lamps\r\nand handy devices used at one time.\r\n\r\nTo make this plant ideal, (for, being an actual affair, it has\r\ndeveloped some short-comings, with the extension of the use of\r\nelectricity) it would require a dynamo whose capacity can be figured,\r\nfrom the following:\r\n\r\n                                                        Watts\r\n    15 carbon lamps, 16 candlepower, @60 watts each      900\r\n    10 tungsten lamps, 20 candlepower, @25 watts each    250\r\n    2 tungsten lamps, 92 candlepower, @100 watts each    200\r\n    Water heater, continuous service                     800\r\n    Toaster, occasional service                          600\r\n    Iron, occasional service                             400\r\n    Oven-baking, roasting, etc                         2,000\r\n    2 stove plates @1,000 watts each                   2,000\r\n    1 stove plate                                        400\r\n    Vacuum cleaner, occasional service                   200\r\n    Vibrator, occasional service                         100\r\n    Small water heater, quart capacity                   400\r\n    Small motor, 1/4 horsepower, occasional              250\r\n    Motor, 1/2 hp, pumping water, etc                    500\r\n    Electric fan, occasional service                     100\r\n                                                     -------\r\n             Total current, one house                  9,100\r\n\r\n\r\n    30 carbon lamps, 16 candlepower, @60               1,800\r\n    2 lamps, 100 watt tungsten                           200\r\n    Electric iron                                        400\r\n    Small water or milk heater                           600\r\n                                                     -------\r\n             Total current, 2nd house                  3,000\r\n                            1st house                  9,100\r\n                                                     -------\r\n                                                      12,100\r\n\r\nThus, in this plant, if every electrical device were turned on at\r\nonce, the demand on the dynamo would be for 12.1 kilowatts, or an\r\noverload of over 100 per cent. The main-switch fuse, being for 60\r\namperes, would \"blow\" or melt, and cut off all current for the\r\nmoment. To repair the damage would be merely the work of a second--and\r\nat a cost of a few cents--simply insert a new fuse, of which there\r\nmust be a supply on hand at all times. Or, if either owner exceeded\r\nhis capacity, the line fuses (one for 20 amperes, and the other for 40\r\namperes) would instantly cut off all current from the greedy one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25 and 40 watt Mazda tungsten lamps (1/4 scale)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lessons From This Plant_\r\n\r\nThe story of this plant illustrates two things which the farmer and\r\nhis wife must take into account when they are figuring how much\r\nelectricity they require. First, it illustrates how one uses more and\r\nmore current, as he finds it so serviceable and labor-saving, and at\r\nthe same time free. The electric range and the water boiler, in the\r\nabove instance, were later acquisitions not counted on in figuring the\r\noriginal installation. Second, it illustrates, that while the normal\r\nload of this generator is _5.75_ kilowatts, one does not have to limit\r\nthe electrical conveniences in the home to this amount. True, he\r\ncannot use more electricity than his plant will produce _at any one\r\ntime_,--but it is only by a stretch of the imagination that one may\r\nconceive the necessity of using them all at once. Ironing, baking, and\r\nthe use of small power are usually limited to daylight hours when no\r\nlights are burning.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, this plant has proved satisfactory in every way;\r\nand only on one or two occasions have fuses been \"blown\", and then it\r\nwas due to carelessness. A modern dynamo is rated liberally. It will\r\nstand an overload of as much as 100 per cent for a short time--half an\r\nhour or so. The danger from overloading is from heating. When the\r\nmachine grows too hot for the hand, it is beginning to char its\r\ninsulation, to continue which, of course would ruin it. The best plant\r\nis that which works under one-half or three-quarters load, under\r\nnormal demands.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Standard Voltage_\r\n\r\nWe are assuming the farmer's plant to be, in 99 cases out of 100, the\r\nstandard 110-volt, direct current type. Such a plant allows for at\r\nleast a 10 per cent regulation, in voltage, up or down the scale;\r\nsupplies for this voltage are to be had without delay in even the more\r\nremote parts of the country, and (being sold in greater volume) they\r\nare cheaper than those for other voltages.\r\n\r\nThere are two general exceptions to this rule as to 110-volt plants:\r\n(1) If the plant is located at a distance greater than a quarter of a\r\nmile from the house, it will be found cheaper (in cost of transmission\r\nline, as will be shown later) to adopt the 220-volt plant; (2), If the\r\nwater supply is so meagre that it must be stored for many hours at a\r\ntime, and then used for charging storage batteries, it will be found\r\nmost economical to use a 30-volt plant. A storage battery is made up\r\nof cells of approximately 2 volts each; and, since more than 55 such\r\ncells would be required for a 110-volt installation, its cost would\r\nbe prohibitive, with many farmers.\r\n\r\nSo we will assume that this plant is a 110-volt plant, to be run\r\nwithout storage battery. It will be well to make a chart, dividing the\r\nfarm requirements into three heads--light, heat, and power.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Light_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 60 and 100 watt Mazda tungsten lamp. These lamps may be\r\nhad in sizes from 10 to 500 watts (1/4 scale)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The lamp of the future. A 1000 watt Mazda nitrogen\r\nlamp, giving 2000 candlepower (1/4 scale)]\r\n\r\nLight is obtained by means of incandescent lamps. There are two styles\r\nin common use, the carbon and the tungsten lamp. It requires 3.5 to 4\r\nwatts of electricity to produce one candlepower in a carbon lamp. It\r\nrequires from 1 to 1.25 watt to produce one candlepower in the\r\ntungsten lamp. The new nitrogen lamp, not yet in general use, requires\r\nonly 1/2 watt to the candlepower. Since tungsten lamps give three\r\ntimes the light of the carbon lamp, they are the most economical to\r\nuse in the city or town where one is paying for commercial current.\r\nBut, in the country where water-power furnishes current for nothing,\r\nit will be found most economical to use the carbon lamp, since its\r\ncost at retail is 16 cents, as compared with 30 cents for a\r\ncorresponding size in tungsten. A 60 watt carbon lamp, of 16\r\ncandlepower; or a 25 watt tungsten lamp, of 20 candlepower, are the\r\nsizes to use. In hanging lamps, as over the dining room table, a 100\r\nwatt tungsten lamp, costing 70 cents, and giving 92 candlepower light\r\nis very desirable; and for lighting the barn-yard, these 100 watt\r\ntungsten lamps should be used. For reading lamps, the tungsten style,\r\nof 40 or 60 watt capacity, will be found best. Otherwise, in all\r\nlocations use the cheaper carbon lamp. Both styles have a rated life\r\nof 1,000 hours, after which they begin to fall off in efficiency. Here\r\nagain, the farmer need not worry over lack of highest efficiency, as a\r\nlamp giving only 80 per cent of its rated candlepower is still\r\nserviceable when he is not paying for the current. With care not to\r\nuse them at voltages beyond their ratings, lamps will last for years.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Specimen Light Allowance_\r\n\r\nBelow is a typical table of lights for a large farm house, the barns\r\nand barn-yard. It is given merely as a guide, to be varied for each\r\nindividual case:\r\n\r\n                                                        Watts\r\n    Kitchen, 2 lights @60 watts                          120\r\n    Dining room, 1 light, tungsten                       100\r\n    Living room, table lamp with 3 tungstens @40         120\r\n    Living room, 2 wall fixtures, 4 lamps @60 watts      240\r\n    Parlor, same as living room                          360\r\n    Pantry, 1 hanging lamp                                60\r\n    Cellar, one portable lamp                             60\r\n    Woodshed, 1 hanging lamp                              60\r\n    2 bedrooms, 2 lights each @ 60                       240\r\n    2 bed rooms, 1 light each @60                        120\r\n    Bathroom, 1 \"turn-down\" light, @60                    60\r\n    Hall, downstairs, 2 lights @60                       120\r\n    Hall, upstairs, 1 light                               60\r\n    Attic, 1 light                                        60\r\n    Porch, 1 light                                        60\r\n    Barn and barn-yard:\r\n    Barn-yard entrance, 1 tungsten                       100\r\n    Watering trough,    1    \"                           100\r\n    Front gate,         1    \"                           100\r\n    Horse barn, 4 lights @60                             240\r\n    Cow barn, 4 lights @60                               240\r\n    Pig house, 1 light                                    60\r\n    Hay barn, 2 lights, @60                              120\r\n                                                     -------\r\n    Total for farmstead                                2,800\r\n\r\nThis provides for 44 lights, an extremely liberal allowance. How many\r\nof these lights will be burning at any one time? Probably not one-half\r\nof them; yet the ideal plant is that which permits all fixtures to be\r\nin service at one time on the rare occasions when necessary. Thus, for\r\nlighting only, 2,800 watts maximum service would require a 4 kilowatt\r\ngenerator, and 10 water horsepower, on the liberal rating of two to\r\none. A 3 kilowatt generator would take care of these lights, with a 30\r\nper cent overload (which is not excessive) for maximum service. The\r\nabove liberal allowance of lights may be cut in two, or four--or even\r\neight--and still throw a kerosene lamp in shadow. It all depends on\r\nthe number of lights one wants burning at one time; and the power of\r\nthe water wheel.\r\n\r\nIf the 36 carbon lights in the above table were replaced by 25 watt\r\ntungsten lights, the saving in power would be 35 watts each, or 1,260\r\nwatts, nearly two electrical horsepower; while the added first cost\r\nwould be 14 cents a light, or $5.04. A generator of 2 kilowatt\r\ncapacity would take care of all these lights then, with 460 watts to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heating_\r\n\r\nElectric heating and cooking is in its infancy, due to the prohibitive\r\ncost of commercial current in our cities. Here the farmer has the\r\nadvantage again, with his cheap current.\r\n\r\nFor heating the house, it is calculated that 2 watts is required for\r\neach cubic foot of air space in a room, during ordinary winter\r\nweather. Thus, a room 10 × 12, and 8 feet high, would contain 960\r\ncubic feet, and would require 1,820 watts energy to heat it in cold\r\nweather. Five such rooms would require 9.1 kilowatts; and 10 such\r\nrooms, or their equivalent, would require 18.2 kilowatts.\r\n\r\nElectric heating devices are divided into two classes: (1) those which\r\ncan be used on lamp circuits, _and do not draw more than 660 watts\r\neach_; and (2) those which draw more than 660, therefore _require\r\nspecial wiring_. The capacity of these devices is approximately as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Lamp circuit devices:              Watts\r\n        Electric iron                400 to 660\r\n        Toaster                      350 to 660\r\n        Vacuum cleaner               200 to 400\r\n        Grill                        400 to 660\r\n        Small water heater           400 to 660\r\n        Hot plates                   400 to 660\r\n\r\n    Lamp circuit devices:\r\n        Coffee percolator            400 to 660\r\n        Chafing dish                 400 to 660\r\n        Electric fan                 100 to 250\r\n\r\n    Special circuit devices:\r\n        Hot water boiler heater      800 to 1,200\r\n        Small ovens                  660 to 1,200\r\n        Range ovens                1,200 to 3,000\r\n        Range, hot plates            400 to 1,300\r\n        Radiators (small)            750 to 1,500\r\n        Radiators (large)          1,500 to 6,000\r\n\r\nThe only device in the above list which is connected continuously, is\r\nthe hot water boiler, and this can be credited with at least one\r\nelectrical horsepower 24 hours a day. It is a small contrivance, not\r\nmuch bigger than a quart can, attached to the back of the kitchen\r\nboiler, and it keeps the water hot throughout the house at all hours.\r\nIts cost will vary with the make, ranging from $8 to $15; and since it\r\nis one of the real blessings of the farm kitchen and bathroom, it\r\nshould be included in all installations where power permits. Electric\r\nradiators will be used 24 hours a day in winter, and not at all in\r\nsummer. They are portable, and can be moved from room to room, and\r\nonly such rooms as are in actual use need be heated. The other devices\r\nare for intermittent service, many of them (like the iron) for only a\r\nfew hours each week.\r\n\r\nThe grill, chafing dish, coffee percolator, etc., which are used on\r\nthe dining room table while the family is at meals, each draw an\r\nequivalent of from 6 to 10 carbon lights. By keeping this in view and\r\nturning off spare lights, one can have the use of them, with even a\r\nsmall plant. Thus, a one kilowatt plant permits the use of any one of\r\nthese lamp circuit devices at a time, with a few lights in addition.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Power_\r\n\r\nElectric power is to be had through motors. A direct current dynamo\r\nand a direct current motor are identical in construction. That is, a\r\nmotor becomes a generator if belted to power; and a generator becomes\r\na motor, if connected to electric mains. This is best illustrated by\r\nciting the instance of a trans-continental railroad which crosses the\r\nBitter Root Mountains by means of electric power. Running 200 miles up\r\na 2 per cent grade, it is drawn by its motors. Coasting 200 miles\r\ndown the 2 per cent grade on the other side of the mountains, its\r\nmotors become generators. They act as brakes, and at the same time\r\nthey pump the power of the coasting weight of this train back into the\r\nwires to help a train coming up the other side of the mountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connections of shunt motor and starting rheostat]\r\n\r\nJust as there are three types of direct current generators, so there\r\nare three types of direct current motors: _series_, _shunt_, and\r\n_compound_, with features already explained in the case of generators.\r\nMotors are rated by horsepower, and generators are rated by kilowatts.\r\nThus a one kilowatt generator has a capacity of 1,000 watts; as a\r\nmotor, it would be rated as 1000/746 horsepower, or 1.34 horsepower.\r\nTheir efficiency varies with their size, ranging from 40 to 60 per\r\ncent in very small motors, and up to 95 per cent in very large ones.\r\nThe following table may be taken as a guide in calculating the power\r\nrequired by motors, on 110-volt circuits:\r\n\r\n     1/4 Horsepower     2-1/2 amperes, or 275 watts\r\n     1/2 hp             4-1/2 amperes, or 500 watts\r\n      1  hp             9     amperes, or 990 watts\r\n      2  hp            17     amperes, or 1.97 kilowatts\r\n      3  hp            26     amperes, or 2.86 kilowatts\r\n      5  hp            40     amperes, or 4.40 kilowatts\r\n    7-1/2 hp           60     amperes, or 6.60 kilowatts\r\n     10  hp            76     amperes, or 8.36 kilowatts\r\n     15  hp           112     amperes, or 12.32 kilowatts\r\n\r\nAn electric motor, in operation, actually generates electricity, which\r\nit pushes back into the line as a counter-electromotive-force. The\r\nstrength of this counter force, in volts, depends on the motor's\r\nspeed, the same as if it were running as a dynamo. For this reason,\r\nwhen a motor is started, and before it comes up to speed, there would\r\nbe a rush of current from the line, with nothing to hold it back, and\r\nthe motor would be burned out unless some means were provided to\r\nprotect it for the moment. This is done by means of a starting\r\nrheostat, similar to the regulating rheostat on the dynamo\r\nswitchboard. This resistance box is connected in \"series\" with the\r\narmature, in the case of shunt and compound motors; and with the\r\nentire motor circuit in the case of a series machine.\r\n\r\nA _series_ motor has a powerful starting torque, and adjusts its speed\r\nto the load. It is used almost altogether in street cars. It can be\r\nused in stump pulling, or derrick work, such as using a hay fork. It\r\nmust always be operated under load, otherwise, it would increase in\r\nspeed until it tore itself to pieces through mechanical strain. The\r\ningenious farmer who puts together an electric plow, with the mains\r\nfollowing behind on a reel, will use a series motor.\r\n\r\nA _shunt_ motor should be used in all situations where a fairly\r\nuniform speed under load is required, such as separating, in milking\r\nmachines, running a lathe, an ensilage cutter, vacuum cleaners,\r\ngrinders, etc.\r\n\r\nThe _compound_ motor has the characteristics of the series and shunt\r\nmotors, giving an increased starting torque, and a more nearly\r\nconstant speed under varying loads than the shunt motor, since the\r\nlatter drops off slightly in speed with increasing load.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flexible Power_\r\n\r\nAn electric motor is an extremely satisfactory form of power because\r\nit is so flexible. Thus, one may use a five horsepower motor for a one\r\nhorsepower task, and the motor will use only one electrical horsepower\r\nin current--just enough to overcome the task imposed on it. For this\r\nreason, a large-sized motor may be used for any operation, from one\r\nrequiring small power, up to its full capacity. It will take an\r\noverload, the same as a dynamo. In other words it is \"eager\" for any\r\ntask imposed on it; therefore it must be protected by fuses, or it\r\nwill consume itself, if too big an overload is imposed on it.\r\n\r\nA one horsepower shunt or compound motor is very serviceable for\r\nroutine farm operations, such as operating the separator, the churn,\r\nthe milking machine, grinder, pump, and other small power jobs. Motors\r\nof 1/4 horsepower are handy in the kitchen, for grinding knives,\r\npolishing silver, etc., and can be used also for vacuum cleaners, and\r\nrunning the sewing machine. For the larger operations, motors will\r\nvary from three horsepower for cutting ensilage, to fifteen horsepower\r\nfor threshing. They can be mounted on trucks and conveyed from one\r\npoint to another, being fed current from the mains by means of\r\nsuitable wires wound on reels.\r\n\r\nRemember, in estimating the size of your plant for light, heat, and\r\npower, that it does not have to be big enough to use all the devices\r\nat one time. Also remember, that two water horsepower to one\r\nelectrical horsepower is a very liberal allowance; and that a\r\ngenerator working under one-half or two-thirds capacity at normal\r\nloads will require less attention than a machine constantly being\r\nworked above its capacity. Therefore, let your generator be of liberal\r\nsize, because the difference in cost between a 5 and 10 kilowatt\r\nmachine is not in proportion to their capacity. In fact (especially\r\namong second-hand machines), the difference in cost is very small. The\r\nmere fact that the generator is of 110 electrical horsepower capacity\r\ndoes not require a turbine of 20 horsepower. The chances are that\r\n(unless you wish to heat your house and do large power jobs) you will\r\nnot use more than 3 to 5 electrical horsepower normally; therefore an\r\nallowance of 10 water horsepower, in this case, would be ample. A\r\nplant used simply for lighting the house and barn, for irons, and\r\ntoasters, and one horsepower motors, need not exceed 2 or 2-1/2\r\nkilowatts for the generator, and 5 or 6 horsepower for the turbine\r\nwheel. Normally it would not use one-half this capacity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTRANSMISSION LINES\r\n\r\n     Copper wire--Setting of poles--Loss of power in transmission--Ohm's\r\n     Law and examples of how it is used in figuring size of\r\n     wire--Copper-wire tables--Examples of transmission lines--When to\r\n     use high voltages--Over-compounding a dynamo to overcome\r\n     transmission loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving determined on the location of the farm water-power electric\r\nplant, and its capacity, in terms of electricity, there remains the\r\nwiring, for the transmission line, and the house and barn.\r\n\r\nFor transmission lines, copper wire covered with waterproof braid--the\r\nso-called weatherproof wire of the trade--is used. Under no\r\ncircumstances should a wire smaller than No. 8, B. & S. gauge be used\r\nfor this purpose, as it would not be strong enough mechanically. The\r\npoles should be of chestnut or cedar, 25 feet long, and set four feet\r\nin the ground. Where it is necessary to follow highways, they should\r\nbe set on the fence line; and in crossing public highways, the\r\nordinance of your own town must guide you. Some towns prescribe a\r\nheight of 19 feet above the road, others 27 feet, some 30. Direct\r\ncurrent, such as is advised for farm installations, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, does not affect telephone wires, and therefore\r\ntransmission lines may be strung on telephone poles. Poles are set at\r\nan average distance of 8 rods; they are set inclined outward on\r\ncorners. Sometimes it is necessary to brace them with guy wires or\r\nwooden braces. Glass insulators are used to fasten the wires to the\r\ncross-arms of the poles, and the tie-wires used for this purpose must\r\nbe the same size as the main wire and carry the same insulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Size of Wire for Transmission_\r\n\r\nTo determine the size of the transmission wires will require knowledge\r\nof the strength of current (in amperes) to be carried, and the\r\ndistance in feet. In transmission, the electric current is again\r\nanalogous to water flowing in pipes. It is subject to resistance,\r\nwhich cuts down the amount of current (in watts) delivered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bringing wires into the house or barn]\r\n\r\nThe loss in transmission is primarily measured in volts; and since the\r\ncapacity of an electric current for work equals the _volts_ multiplied\r\nby _amperes_, which gives _watts_, every volt lost reduces the working\r\ncapacity of the current by so much. This loss is referred to by\r\nelectrical engineers as the \"C^2R loss,\" which is another way of\r\nsaying that the loss is equal to the _square of the current in\r\namperes_, multiplied by _ohms_ resistance. Thus, if the amperes\r\ncarried is 10, and the ohms resistance of the line is 5, then the loss\r\nin watts to convey that current would be (10 × 10) × 5, or 500 watts,\r\nnearly a horsepower.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of _one volt_ (as we have seen in another chapter) is\r\nsufficient to force _one ampere_, through a resistance of _one ohm_.\r\nSuch a current would have no capacity for work, since its pressure\r\nwould be consumed in the mere act of transmission.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the pressure were _110 volts_, and the current _one\r\nampere_, and the resistance _one ohm_, the effective pressure after\r\ntransmission would be 110-1, or 109 volts.\r\n\r\nTo force a 110-volt current of _50 amperes_ through the resistance of\r\n_one ohm_, would require the expenditure of _50 volts_ pressure. Its\r\ncapacity for work, after transmission, would be 110-50, or _60 volts,\r\n× 50 amperes_, or 3,000 watts. As this current consisted of _110 ×\r\n50_, or 5,500 watts at the point of starting, the loss would be 2,500\r\nwatts, or about 45 per cent. It is bad engineering to allow more than\r\n10 per cent loss in transmission.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of keeping this loss down. One is by increasing\r\nthe size of the transmission wires, thus cutting down the resistance\r\nin ohms; the other way is by raising the voltage, thus cutting down\r\nthe per cent loss. For instance, suppose the pressure was 1,100 volts,\r\ninstead of 110 volts. Five amperes at 1,100 volts pressure, gives the\r\nsame number of watts, power, as 50 amperes, at 110 volts pressure.\r\nTherefore it would be necessary to carry only 5 amperes, at this rate.\r\nThe loss would be 5 volts, or less than 1/2 of 1 per cent, as compared\r\nwith 45 per cent with 110 volts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Splicing transmission wire]\r\n\r\nIn large generating stations, where individual dynamos frequently\r\ngenerate as much as 20,000 horsepower, and the current must be\r\ntransmitted over several hundred miles of territory, the voltage is\r\nfrequently as high as 150,000, with the amperes reduced in proportion.\r\nThen the voltage is lowered to a suitable rate, and the amperage\r\nraised in proportion, by special machinery, at the point of use.\r\n\r\nIt is the principle of the C^2R loss, which the farmer must apply in\r\ndetermining the size of wire he is to use in transmitting his current\r\nfrom the generator switchboard to his house or barn. The wire table on\r\npage 159, together with the formula to be used in connection with it,\r\nreduce the calculations necessary to simple arithmetic. In this table\r\nthe resistance of the various sizes of wire is computed from the fact\r\nthat a wire of pure copper 1 foot long, and 1/1000 inch in diameter\r\n(equal to one circular mill) offers a resistance of 10.6 ohms to the\r\nfoot. The principle of the C^2R loss is founded on Ohm's Law, which is\r\nexplained in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nThe formula by which the size of transmission wire is determined, for\r\nany given distance, and a given number of amperes, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Distance ft. one way × 22 × No. of amperes   circular\r\n  ------------------------------------------ =  mills.\r\n             Number of volts lost\r\n\r\nIn other words, multiply the _distance in feet_ from mill to house by\r\n22, and multiply this product by the _number of amperes_ to be\r\ncarried. Then divide the product by the _number of volts_ to be lost;\r\nand the result will be the diameter of the wire required _in circular\r\nmills_. By referring to the table above, the B. & S. gauge of the wire\r\nnecessary for transmission, can be found from the nearest\r\ncorresponding number under the second column, entitled \"circular mills\r\narea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n     COPPER WIRE TABLE\r\n\r\n  --------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n          |          | _Area in  | _(R) Ohms |           |\r\n  _B.& S. | _Feet    | circular  | per 1,000 | _Feet     | _(R) Ohms\r\n  Gauge_  | per Lb._ | mills_    | feet_     | per Ohm_  | per pound_\r\n  --------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n   0000   |   1.561  | 211,600   |   .04904  | 20,392.90 |  .00007653\r\n   000    |   1.969  | 167,805   |   .06184  | 16,172.10 |  .00012169\r\n   00     |   2.482  | 133,079   |   .07797  | 12,825.40 |  .00019438\r\n   0      |   3.130  | 105,534   |   .09829  | 10,176.40 |  .00030734\r\n     1    |   3.947  |  83,694   |   .12398  |  8,066.00 |  .00048920\r\n     2    |   4.977  |  66,373   |   .15633  |  6,396.70 |  .00077784\r\n     3    |   6.276  |  52,634   |   .19714  |  5,072.50 |  .00123700\r\n     4    |   7.914  |  41,742   |   .24858  |  4,022.90 |  .00196660\r\n     5    |   9.980  |  33,102   |   .31346  |  3,190.20 |  .00312730\r\n     6    |  12.58   |  26,250   |   .39528  |  2,529.90 |  .00497280\r\n     7    |  15.87   |  20,816   |   .49845  |  2,006.20 |  .00790780\r\n     8    |  20.01   |  16,509   |   .62840  |  1,591.10 |  .01257190\r\n     9    |  25.23   |  13,094   |   .79242  |  1,262.00 |  .01998530\r\n    10    |  31.82   |  10,381   |   .99948  |  1,000.50 |  .03178460\r\n    11    |  40.12   |   8,234.0 |  1.26020  |    793.56 |  .05054130\r\n    12    |  50.59   |   6,529.9 |  1.58900  |    629.32 |  .08036410\r\n    13    |  63.79   |   5,178.4 |  2.00370  |    499.06 |  .12778800\r\n    14    |  80.44   |   4,106.8 |  2.52660  |    395.79 |  .20318000\r\n    15    | 101.4    |   3,256.7 |  3.18600  |    313.87 |  .32307900\r\n    16    | 127.9    |   2,582.9 |  4.01760  |    248.90 |  .51373700\r\n    17    | 161.3    |   2,048.2 |  5.06600  |    197.39 |  .81683900\r\n    18    | 203.4    |   1,624.3 |  6.38800  |    156.54 | 1.29876400\r\n  --------+----------+-----------+-----------+-----------+------------\r\n\r\n\r\n     CARRYING CAPACITY OF WIRES AND WEIGHT\r\n\r\n  -----------+-------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n             | _Weight 1,000 ft. | _Carrying capacity | _Carrying capacity\r\n  _B. & S.   |  Weatherproof     | Weatherproof       | rubber cov.\r\n  Gauge No._ |  (Pounds)_        | (Amperes)_         | (Amperes)_\r\n  -----------+-------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n    0000     |        800        |        312         |        175\r\n     000     |        666        |        262         |        145\r\n      00     |        500        |        220         |        120\r\n       0     |        363        |        185         |        100\r\n       1     |        313        |        156         |         95\r\n       2     |        250        |        131         |         70\r\n       3     |        200        |        110         |         60\r\n       4     |        144        |         92         |         50\r\n       5     |        125        |         77         |         45\r\n       6     |        105        |         65         |         35\r\n       7     |         87        |         55         |         30\r\n       8     |         69        |         46         |         25\r\n      10     |         50        |         32         |         20\r\n      12     |         31        |         23         |         15\r\n      14     |         22        |         16         |         10\r\n      16     |         14        |          8         |          5\r\n      18     |         11        |          5         |          3\r\n  -----------+-------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nSince two wires are required for electrical transmission, the above\r\nformula is made simple by counting the distance only one way, in feet,\r\nand doubling the resistance constant, 10.6, which, for convenience is\r\ntaken as 22, instead of 21.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Examples of Transmission Lines_\r\n\r\nAs an example, let us say that Farmer Jones has installed a\r\nwater-power electric plant on his brook, _200 yards distant_ from his\r\nhouse. The generator is a 5 kilowatt machine, capable of producing _45\r\namperes_ at _110 volts pressure_. He has a 3 horsepower motor, drawing\r\n26 amperes at full load; he has 20 lights of varying capacities,\r\nrequiring 1,200 watts, or 10 amperes when all on; and his wife uses\r\nirons, toasters, etc., which amount to another 9 or 10 amperes--say 45\r\naltogether. The chances are that he will never use all of the\r\napparatus at one time; but for flexibility, and his own satisfaction\r\nin not having to stop to think if he is overloading his wires, he\r\nwould like to be able to draw the full _45 amperes_ if he wishes to.\r\nHe is willing to allow _5 per cent loss_ in transmission. _What size\r\nwires will be necessary, and what will they cost?_ Substituting these\r\nvalues in the above formula, the result is:\r\n\r\n  Answer: 600 × 22 × 45\r\n          ------------- = 108,000 circular mills.\r\n               5.5\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Transmission wire on glass insulator]\r\n\r\nReferring to the table, No. 0 wire is 105,534 circular mills, and is\r\nnear enough; so this wire would be used. It would require 1,200 feet,\r\nwhich would weigh, by the second table, 435.6 pounds. At 19 cents a\r\npound, it would cost $82.76.\r\n\r\nFarmer Jones says this is more money than he cares to spend for\r\ntransmission. As a matter of fact, he says, he never uses his motor\r\nexcept in the daytime, when his lights are not burning; so the maximum\r\nload on his line at any one time would be _26 amperes_, not 45. _What\r\nsize wire would he use in this instance?_\r\n\r\nSubstituting 26 for 45 in the equation, the result is 61,300 circular\r\nmills, which corresponds to No. 2 wire. It would cost $57.00.\r\n\r\nNow, if Farmer Jones, in an emergency, wished to use his motor at the\r\nsame time he was using all his lights and his wife was ironing and\r\nmaking toast--in other words, if he wanted to use the _45 amperes_\r\ncapacity of his dynamo, _how many volts would he lose?_ To get this\r\nanswer, we change the formula about, until it reads as follows:\r\n\r\n   Distance in feet × 22 × amperes\r\n  --------------------------------- = Number of volts lost\r\n           circular mills\r\n\r\nSubstituting values, we have, in this case, 600 × 22 × 45/66,373 (No.\r\n2) = 9 volts, nearly, less than 10 per cent. This is a very efficient\r\nline, under the circumstances. Now if he is willing to lose 10 per\r\ncent on _half-load_, instead of full load, he can save still more\r\nmoney in line wire. In that case (as you can find by applying the\r\nformula again), he could use No. 5 wire, at a cost of $28.50. He would\r\nlose 11 volts pressure drawing 26 amperes; and he would lose 18 volts\r\npressure drawing 45 amperes, if by any chance he wished to use full\r\nload.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, this dynamo would be regulated, by means of the\r\nfield resistance, to register 110 plus 11 volts, or 121 volts at the\r\nswitchboard to make up for the loss at half-load. At full load, his\r\nvoltage at the end of the line would be 121 minus 18, or 103 volts;\r\nhis motor would run a shade slower, at this voltage, and his lights\r\nwould be slightly dimmer. He would probably not notice the difference.\r\nIf he did, he could walk over to his generating station, and raise\r\nthe voltage a further 7 volts by turning the rheostat handle another\r\nnotch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A barn-yard light]\r\n\r\nThousands of plants can be located within 100 feet of the house. If\r\nFarmer Jones could do this, he could use No. 8 wire, costing $2.62.\r\nThe drop in pressure would be 5.99 volts at full load--so small it\r\ncould be ignored entirely. In this case the voltmeter should be made\r\nto read 116 volts at the switchboard, by means of the rheostat.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, this plant were 1,000 feet away from the house\r\nand the loss 10 volts the size wire would be\r\n\r\n  1,000 × 22 × 45\r\n  ---------------  = 99,000 circular mills;\r\n        10\r\n\r\na No. 0 wire comes nearest to this figure, and its cost, for 2,000\r\nfeet, at 19 cents a pound, would be $137.94. A No. 0000 wire, costing\r\n$294.00, would give a 5 per cent drop at full load. In this case, the\r\ncost of transmission can be reduced to a much lower figure, by\r\nallowing a bigger drop at half-load, with regulation at the\r\nswitchboard. Thus, a No. 2 wire here, costing but $95, would be\r\nsatisfactory in every way. The loss at half-load would be about 9\r\nvolts, and the rheostat would be set permanently for 119 or 120 volts.\r\nA modern dynamo can be regulated in voltage by over 25 per cent in\r\neither direction, without harm, if care is taken not to overload it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Benefit of Higher Voltages_\r\n\r\nIf Farmer Jones' plant is a half of a mile away from the house, he\r\nfaces a more serious proposition in the way of transmission. Say he\r\nwishes to transmit 26 amperes with a loss of 10 volts. What size wire\r\nwill be necessary?\r\n\r\n        2640 × 22 × 26\r\n  Thus: -------------- = 151,000 circular mills.\r\n              10\r\n\r\nA No. 000 wire is nearest this size, and 5,280 feet of it would cost\r\nover $650.00. This cost would be prohibitive. If, however, he\r\ninstalled a 220-volt dynamo--at no increase in cost--then he would\r\nhave to transmit only a half of 26 amperes, or 13 amperes, and he\r\ncould allow 22 volts loss, counting 10 per cent. In this case, the\r\nproblem would work out as follows:\r\n\r\n  2640 × 22 × 13\r\n  -------------- = 34,320 circular mills,\r\n        22\r\n\r\nor approximately a No. 5 wire which, at 19 cents a pound, would cost\r\n$120.65.\r\n\r\nInstall a 550-volt generator, instead of a 220-volt machine and the\r\namperes necessary would be cut to 5.2, and the volts lost would be\r\nraised to 55. In this case a No. 12 wire would carry the current; but\r\nsince it would not be strong enough for stringing on poles, a No. 8\r\nwire would be used, costing about $63.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen from these examples how voltage influences the\r\nefficiency of transmission. Current generated at a pressure in excess\r\nof 550 volts is not to be recommended for farm plants unless an expert\r\nis in charge. A safer rule is not to exceed 220 volts, for while 550\r\nvolts is not necessarily deadly, it is dangerous. When one goes into\r\nhigher voltages, it is necessary to change the type of dynamo to\r\n_alternating current_, so that the current can be transformed to safe\r\nvoltages at the point where it is used. Since only the occasional farm\r\nplant requires a high-tension system, the details of such a plant will\r\nnot be gone into here.\r\n\r\nIn transmitting the electric current over miles of territory,\r\nengineers are accustomed to figure 1,000 volts for each mile. Since\r\nthis is a deadly pressure, it should not be handled by any one not an\r\nexpert, which, in this case, the farmer is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Over-Compounding the Generator_\r\n\r\nOne can absorb the loss in transmission frequently, by\r\nover-compounding the machine. In describing the compound machine, in\r\nChapter Five, it is shown that the usual compound dynamo on the market\r\nis the so-called flat-compounded type. In such a dynamo, the voltage\r\nremains constant at the switchboard, from no load to full load,\r\nallowing for a slight curve which need not be taken into account.\r\n\r\nNow, by adding a few more turns to the series wires on the field coils\r\nof such a dynamo, a machine is to be had which gradually raises its\r\nvoltage as the load comes on in increasing volume. Thus, one could\r\nsecure such a machine, which would begin generating at 110 volts, and\r\nwould gradually rise to 150 at full load. Yet the voltage would remain\r\nconstant at the point of use, the excess being absorbed in\r\ntransmission. A machine of this type can be made to respond to any\r\nrequired rise in voltage.\r\n\r\nAs an example of how to take advantage of this very valuable fact, let\r\nus take an instance:\r\n\r\nSay that Farmer Jones has a transmission line 1,000 feet long strung\r\nwith No. 7 copper wire. This 2,000 feet of wire would introduce a\r\nresistance of one ohm in the circuit. That is, every ampere of current\r\ndrawn at his house would cause the working voltage there to fall one\r\nvolt. If he drew 26 amperes, the voltage would fall, at the house, 26\r\nvolts. If his switchboard voltage was set at say 120, the voltage at\r\nhis house, at 26 amperes of load, would fall to 94 volts, which would\r\ncause his lights to dim considerably. It would be a very\r\nunsatisfactory transmission line, with a flat-compounded dynamo.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if his dynamo was over-compounded 25 per cent--that\r\nis, if it gained 28 volts from no load to full load, the system would\r\nbe perfect. In this case, the dynamo would be operated at 110 volts\r\npressure at the switchboard with no load. At full load the voltmeter\r\nwould indicate 110 plus 26, or 136 volts. The one or two lights burned\r\nat the power plant would be subject to a severe strain; but the 50 or\r\n100 lights burned at the house and barn would burn at constant\r\nvoltage, which is very economical for lamps.\r\n\r\nThe task of over-compounding a dynamo can be done by any trained\r\nelectrician. The farmer himself, if he progresses far enough in his\r\nstudy of electricity, can do it. It is necessary to remove the top or\r\n\"series\" winding from the field coils. Count the number of turns of\r\nthis wire to each spool. Then procure some identical wire in town and\r\nbegin experimenting. Say you found four turns of field wire to each\r\nspool. Now wind on five, or six, being careful to wind it in the same\r\ndirection as the coils you removed and connect it in the same way. If\r\nthis additional number of turns does not raise the voltage enough, in\r\nactual practice, when the dynamo is running from no load to full load,\r\nadd another turn or two. With patience, the task can be done by any\r\ncareful mechanic. The danger is in not winding the coils the same way\r\nas before, and getting the connections wrong. To prevent this mistake,\r\nmake a chart of the \"series\" coils as you take them off.\r\n\r\nTo make the task of over-compounding your own dynamo even more simple,\r\nwrite to the manufacturers, giving style and factory number of your\r\nmachine. Tell them how much voltage rise you wish to secure, and ask\r\nthem how many turns of \"series\" wire should be wound on each spool in\r\nplace of the old \"series\" coil. They could tell you exactly, since\r\nthey have mathematical diagrams of each machine they make.\r\n\r\nAvoid overloading an over-compounded machine. Since its voltage is\r\nraised automatically, its output in watts is increased a similar\r\namount at the switchboard, and, for a given resistance, its output in\r\namperes would be increased the same amount, as can be ascertained by\r\napplying Ohm's Law. Your ammeter is the best guide. Your machine is\r\nbuilt to stand a certain number of amperes, and this should not be\r\nexceeded in general practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWIRING THE HOUSE\r\n\r\n     The insurance code--Different kinds of wiring described--Wooden\r\n     moulding cheap and effective--The distributing panel--Branch\r\n     circuits--Protecting the circuits--The use of porcelain tubes and\r\n     other insulating devices--Putting up chandeliers and wall\r\n     brackets--\"Multiple\" connections--How to connect a wall\r\n     switch--Special wiring required for heat and power circuits--Knob\r\n     and cleat wiring, its advantages and drawbacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe task of wiring your house is a simple one, with well-defined rules\r\nprescribed by your insurance company. Electricity, properly installed,\r\nis much safer than oil lamps--so much so indeed that insurance\r\ncompanies are ready to quote especial rates. But they require that the\r\nwiring be done in accordance with rules laid down by their experts,\r\nwho form a powerful organization known as the National Board of Fire\r\nUnderwriters. Ask your insurance agent for a copy of the code rules.\r\n\r\nDanger of fire from an electric current comes from the \"short\r\ncircuit,\" partial or complete; and it is against this danger that the\r\nrules guard one. The amount of electricity flowing through a short\r\ncircuit is limited only by the fuse protecting that line; and since\r\nthere is no substance known that can withstand the heat of the\r\nelectric arc, short circuits must be guarded against. Happily the\r\ncurrent is so easily controlled that the fire hazard is eliminated\r\nentirely--something which cannot be done with oil lamps.\r\n\r\nIn house-wiring for farm plants, the wire should be rubber-covered,\r\nand not smaller than No. 14 B. & S. gauge. This is the wire to use on\r\nall lamp circuits. It costs about $0.85 cents per 100 feet. There are\r\nfour kinds of wiring permitted, under the insurance code:\r\n\r\n(1) _Flexible armoured cable_: This consists of two-wire cable,\r\nprotected with a covering of flexible steel. It is installed out of\r\nsight between the walls, and provides suitable outlets for lamps,\r\netc., by means of metal boxes set flush with the plaster. It is\r\neasily installed in a house being built, but requires much tearing\r\ndown of plaster for an old house. Since its expense prohibits it in\r\nthe average farm house, this system will not be described in detail\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n(2) _Rigid and flexible conduit_: As the name implies this system\r\nconsists of iron pipe, in connection with flexible conduit, run\r\nbetween the walls. It differs from the above system, in that the pipes\r\nwith their fittings and outlet boxes are installed first, and the\r\nwires are then \"fished\" through them. Duplex wires--the two wires of\r\nthe circuit woven in one braid--are used; and a liberal amount of\r\nsoapstone, and occasionally kerosene, are used to make the wires slip\r\neasily into place. This is the most expensive system, and the best;\r\nbut it is difficult to install it in an old house without tearing down\r\na good deal of plaster. It has the advantage of being absolutely\r\nwaterproof and fireproof.\r\n\r\n(3) _Wooden moulding_: This is simply moulding, providing two\r\nraceways for the insulated wires to run in, and covered with a\r\ncapping. It is nailed or screwed firmly to the wall, on top of the\r\nplaster; and when the wires have been installed in their respective\r\nslots and the capping tacked on, the moulding is given a coat of paint\r\nto make it in harmony with the other moulding in the room. This system\r\nis cheap, safe, and easily installed, and will be described in detail\r\nhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of wooden moulding]\r\n\r\n(4) _Open wiring_: In open wiring, the wires are stretched from one\r\nsupport to another (such as beams) and held by means of porcelain\r\ncleats, or knobs. It is the simplest to install; but it has the\r\nobjection of leaving the wires unprotected, and is ugly. It is very\r\nsatisfactory in barns or out-buildings however.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Distributing Panel_\r\n\r\nThe first point to consider in wiring a house with wooden moulding is\r\nthe distribution board. It should be located centrally, on the wall\r\nnear the ceiling, so as to be out of ordinary reach. It consists of a\r\npanel of wood--though fireproof material is better--firmly screwed to\r\nthe wall, and containing in a row, the porcelain cut-outs, as shown in\r\nthe cut, from which the various branch circuits are to be led. Each\r\ncut-out provides for two branch circuits; and each branch contains\r\nreceptacles for two plug fuses. These fuses should be of 6 amperes\r\neach. The Insurance Code limits the amount of electricity that may be\r\ndrawn on any branch lamp circuit to 660 watts; and these fuses protect\r\nthe circuit from drafts beyond this amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Porcelain cut-out and plug fuse]\r\n\r\nThe mains, leading from the entrance switch, as shown in the diagram,\r\nto the panel board, should be of the same size as the transmission\r\nwire itself, and rubber-covered. These mains terminate at the\r\ndistributing board. They are connected to the terminals of the\r\ncut-outs by means of heavy brass screws.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wire Joints_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Examples of cleat and knob wiring, 1, 2, 3; wire\r\njoints, 4; flexible armoured conductor, 5]\r\n\r\nThe branch circuits are, as has been said, of No. 14 rubber-covered\r\nwire, running concealed in wooden moulding. All joints or splices in\r\nthis wire are made, as shown in the illustration, by first scraping\r\nthe wires bright, and fastening them stoutly together. This joint is\r\nthen soldered, to make the connection electrically perfect. Soft\r\nsolder is used, with ordinary soldering salts. There are several\r\ncompounds on the market, consisting of soft solder in powder form,\r\nready-mixed with flux. Coat the wire joint with this paste and apply\r\nthe flame of an alcohol lamp. The soldered joint is then covered with\r\nrubber tape, and over this ordinary friction tape is wound on. A neat\r\njoint should not be larger than the diameter of the wire before\r\ninsulation is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Branch Circuits_\r\n\r\nFirst, make a diagram of your rooms and indicate where you wish lamps,\r\nor outlets for other purposes. Since wooden moulding can be run across\r\nceilings, and up or down walls, lamps may be located in places where\r\nthey are out of the way. In planning the circuit, remember that you\r\nwill want many outlets in handy places on the walls, from which\r\nportable cords will convey current to table lamps, to electric irons\r\nand toasters and other handy devices which can be used on the lamp\r\ncircuit. These outlets are made of porcelain, in two pieces. One\r\npiece is merely a continuation of the moulding itself; and the other\r\nis a cap to connect permanently to the end of the lamp or iron cord,\r\nwhich may be snapped into place in a second. Since there are a great\r\nmany designs of separable current taps on the market, it is well to\r\nselect one design and stick to it throughout the house, so that any\r\ndevice can be connected to any outlet.\r\n\r\nThe code permits 660 watts on each circuit. This would allow 12 lamps\r\nof 55 watts each. It is well to limit any one circuit to 6 lamps; this\r\nwill give leeway for the use of small stoves, irons, toasters, etc.\r\nwithout overloading the circuit and causing a fuse to blow.\r\n\r\nHaving installed your distributing board, with its cut-outs, figure\r\nout the course of your first branch circuit. Let us say it will\r\nprovide lights and outlets for the dining room and living room. It\r\nwill be necessary to run the wires through the partitions or floors in\r\nseveral places. For this purpose porcelain tubes should be used,\r\ncosting one to three cents each. Knock holes in the plaster at the\r\ndetermined point, insert the tubes so they project 3/4 inch on each\r\nside, and fill up the ragged edge of the hole neatly with plaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The distributing panel]\r\n\r\nWhen all the tubes have been set in place, begin laying the moulding.\r\nRun it in a straight line, on the wall against the ceiling wherever\r\npossible, mitering the joints neatly. Whenever it is necessary to\r\nchange the run from the ceiling to the wall and a miter cannot be\r\nmade, the wires should be protected in passing from one slot to the\r\nother by being enclosed in non-metallic flexible conduit, called\r\ncircular loom.\r\n\r\nIn running wooden moulding, avoid brick walls liable to sweat or draw\r\ndampness; keep away from places where the heat of a stove might\r\ndestroy the rubber insulation of the wires; do not pass nearer than\r\nsix inches to water pipes when possible--and when it is necessary to\r\npass nearer than this, the wooden moulding should pass above the pipe,\r\nnot below it, with at least an inch of air space intervening, thus\r\navoiding dampness from sweating of pipes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snap switch connections]\r\n\r\nPlaces where chandeliers or wall bracket lamps are to be installed\r\npermanently are fitted with wooden terminal blocks, which fit over\r\nthe moulding and flush with the plaster. These, after holes have been\r\nbored in them for the wires, and the wires drawn through, should be\r\nscrewed firmly to the wall or ceiling, always choosing a joist or beam\r\nfor support. Then a crow's-foot, or tripod of iron, tapped and\r\nthreaded for iron pipe, is screwed to the terminal block. The iron\r\npipe of the chandelier or wall bracket is then screwed home in this\r\ncrow's-foot.\r\n\r\nDo not begin stringing wires until all the moulding of the circuit has\r\nbeen laid. Then thread the wires through the wall or floor tubes and\r\nlay them in their respective slots. If trouble be found making them\r\nstay in place before the capping is put on, small tacks may be driven\r\ninto the moulding beside them to hold them. When a terminal block is\r\nreached, a loop is made of each wire, through the hole cut in the\r\nblock, if the circuit is to continue in the same direction. If it is\r\nto end there, the two wires are drawn through taut, and cut off at a\r\nlength of 5 or 6 inches. These end wires, or loops, are then scraped\r\nbare and spliced to the two wires coming out of the chandelier or\r\nwall bracket. This joint is then soldered and covered with tape, and\r\nthe shell of the chandelier is screwed into place, covering the joint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of wooden moulding]\r\n\r\nIf the moulding is run along the walls flush with the ceiling, as is\r\nusual, a branch is made for a wall light, or wall tap, by means of a\r\nporcelain \"T,\" or branch-block, which provides the means for running\r\nthe circuit at right angles to itself without letting the wires come\r\nin contact with each other where they cross. Separable current taps\r\nshould be installed in handy places on all circuits, so that small\r\nheating devices may be used without removing the lamps from their\r\nsockets. The two wires are bared for half an inch where they run\r\nthrough these current taps, and are fastened by means of brass screws.\r\n\r\n\r\n_\"Multiple\" Connections_\r\n\r\nAll electric devices for this installation--lamps, irons, vacuum\r\ncleaners, motors--must be connected _across_ the circuit--that is,\r\nbridged, from one wire to the other. This is called _multiple_, or\r\nshunt connection. There is only one exception to it, in wiring the\r\nhouse. That one exception is installing a wall switch, the ordinary\r\nsnap switch. Since this wall switch, is, in effect, merely an\r\ninstrument, which opens or closes a circuit, it should be connected to\r\nonly one wire, which is cut to provide two ends for the screw\r\nconnections in the switch. When a moulding branch is run down from the\r\nceiling to some convenient spot for a snap switch (with which to turn\r\nthe lights of a room on or off), a porcelain \"T\" is not used. All that\r\nis necessary to do is to loop the bottom wire of the circuit down\r\nthrough the branch moulding, and connect it to the switch at a\r\nterminal block, or porcelain base.\r\n\r\nIn wiring lamp fixtures, No. 14 rubber-covered wire will usually prove\r\ntoo large. For this purpose, No. 18 may be used, with one lamp to each\r\nloop. Hanging lamps may not be supported by electric lamp cord itself,\r\nif there is more than one lamp in the cluster, because the weight is\r\napt to break the electrical connections. In such a case, the lamp\r\nshould be supported by a chain, and the twisted cord conveying current\r\nto the electric bulbs, is woven in the links of the chain. For the\r\npantry, kitchen, woodshed, barn, etc., a single hanging lamp may be\r\nsuspended from a fielding rosette, as shown in the cut, provided a\r\nsingle knot is tied inside both the rosette and the lamp socket, to\r\nmake it secure. This makes a very cheap fixture. The rosette of\r\nporcelain will cost 15 cents; the lamp socket 20 cents, and the lamp\r\ncord suspending the lamp and carrying the current will cost 1-1/2\r\ncents a foot; while a tin shade will cost another 15 cents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of simple hanging lamp supported by rosette]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Official Inspection_\r\n\r\nIn all communities, your insurance agent must inspect and pass your\r\nwiring before you are permitted to throw the main switch and turn on\r\nthe electricity. Frequently they require that the moulding be left\r\nuncapped, until they have inspected it. If you have more than 660\r\nwatts in lamps to a circuit; if your joints are not soldered and well\r\ntaped; if the moulding is used in any concealed or damp place, the\r\nagent is liable to condemn your work and refuse permission to turn on\r\nthe electricity. However the rules are so clearly defined that it is\r\ndifficult to go wrong; and a farmer who does his own wiring and takes\r\npride in its appearance is more apt to be right than a professional\r\nelectrician who is careless at his task. After the work has been\r\npassed, tack on the moulding capping, with brads, and paint the\r\nmoulding to match the woodwork.\r\n\r\nWooden moulding wiring is perfectly satisfactory if properly\r\ninstalled. It is forbidden in many large cities, because of the\r\nliability of careless workmanship. It should never be installed in\r\ndamp places, or out of sight. If the work is well done, the system\r\nleaves nothing to be desired; and it has the additional advantage of\r\nbeing cheap, and easily done by any farmer who can use carpenter\r\ntools. Farmers with moulding machinery can make their own moulding.\r\nThe code prescribes it shall be of straight-grained wood; that the\r\nraceways for the wires shall be separated by a tongue of wood one-half\r\ninch wide; and that the backing shall be at least 3/8 inch thick. It\r\nmust be covered, inside and out, with at least two coats of\r\nmoisture-repellant paint. It can be had ready-made for about 2 cents a\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Heating Circuits_\r\n\r\nIf one plans using electricity for heavy-duty stoves, such as ranges\r\nand radiators, it is necessary to install a separate heating circuit.\r\nThis is the best procedure in any event, even when the devices are all\r\nsmall and suited to lamp circuits. The wire used can be determined by\r\nreferring to the table for carrying capacity, under the column headed\r\n\"rubber-covered.\" A stove or range drawing 40 amperes, would require a\r\nNo. 4 wire, in moulding. A good plan is to run the heating circuit\r\nthrough the basement, attaching it to the rafters by means of\r\nporcelain knobs. Branches can then be run up through the floor to\r\nplaces where outlets are desired. Such a branch circuit should carry\r\nfuses suitable to the allowed carrying capacity of the wire.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Knob and Cleat Wiring_\r\n\r\nKnob and cleat wiring, such as is used extensively for barns and\r\nout-buildings, requires little explanation. The wires should not be\r\ncloser than 2-1/2 inches in open places, and a wider space is better.\r\nThe wires should be drawn taut, and supported by cleats or knobs at\r\nleast every four feet. In case of branch circuits, one wire must be\r\nprotected from the other it passes by means of a porcelain tube. It\r\nshould never be used in damp places, and should be kept clear of dust\r\nand litter, and protected from abrasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Knob and cleat wiring]\r\n\r\nKnob and tube wiring is frequently used in houses, being concealed\r\nbetween walls or flooring. In this case, the separate wires are\r\nstretched on adjoining beams or rafters, and porcelain tubes are used,\r\nin passing through cross beams. For a ceiling or wall outlet, a\r\nspliced branch is passed through the plaster by means of porcelain\r\ntubes or flexible loom.\r\n\r\nWires from the house to the barn should be uniform with transmission\r\nwires. At the point of entry to buildings they must be at least six\r\ninches apart, and must take the form of the \"drop loop\" as shown in\r\nthe illustration. A double-pole entrance switch must be provided,\r\nopening downward, with a double-pole fuse. In passing over buildings\r\nwires must not come closer than 7 feet to flat roofs, or one foot to a\r\nridge roof. Feed-wires for electric motors should be determined from\r\nthe table of safe carrying capacities, and should be of liberal size.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC PLANT AT WORK\r\n\r\n     Direct-connected generating sets--Belt drive--The\r\n     switchboard--Governors and voltage regulators--Methods of achieving\r\n     constant pressure at all loads: Over-compounding the dynamo; A\r\n     system of resistances; (A home-made electric radiator); Regulating\r\n     voltage by means of the rheostat--Automatic devices--Putting the\r\n     plant in operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDynamos may be connected to water wheels either by means of a belt, or\r\nthe armature may spin on the same shaft as the water wheel itself. The\r\nlatter is by far the more desirable way, as it eliminates the loss of\r\npower through shafting and belting, and does away altogether\r\nwith the belts themselves as a source of trouble. An installation\r\nwith the water wheel and armature on the same shaft is called a\r\n\"direct-connected set\" and is of almost universal use in large power\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nTo be able to use such a direct-connected set, the dynamo must be\r\ndesigned to develop its full voltage when run at a speed identical\r\nwith that of the water wheel. That is, if the dynamo is wound to be\r\nrun at a speed of 800 revolutions per minute, it must be driven by a\r\nwater wheel which runs at this speed and can be governed within narrow\r\nlimits. Small impulse wheels running under great heads attain high\r\nspeed, and for such wheels it is possible to obtain a suitable dynamo\r\nat low cost. For instance, a 12-inch impulse wheel, running under a\r\n200-foot head will develop 6-3/4 horsepower when running at a speed of\r\n875 revolutions per minute. A dynamo for direct coupling to such a\r\nwheel should have a rated speed within 5 per cent of 875 r.p.m.; and,\r\nas generators of this speed are to be had from the stock of almost all\r\nmanufacturers, there would be no extra charge.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to the larger wheels, however, of the impulse type, or\r\nto turbines operating under their usual head the question becomes a\r\nlittle more difficult. In such cases, the speed of the water wheel\r\nwill vary from 150 revolutions per minute, to 400, which is slow\r\nspeed for a small dynamo. As a general rule, the higher the speed of a\r\ndynamo, the lower the cost; because, to lower the speed for a given\r\nvoltage, it is necessary either to increase the number of conductors\r\non the armature, or to increase the number of field coils, or both.\r\nThat means a larger machine, and a corresponding increase in cost.\r\n\r\nIn practice, in large plants, with alternating-current machines it has\r\nbecome usual to mount the field magnets on the shaft, and build the\r\narmature as a stationary ring in whose air space the field coils\r\nrevolve. This simplifies the construction of slow-speed, large-output\r\ndynamos. Such a machine, however, is not to be had for the modest\r\nisolated plant of the farmer with his small water-power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Instantaneous photograph of high-pressure water jet\r\nbeing quenched by buckets of a tangential wheel]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A tangential wheel, and a dynamo keyed to the same\r\nshaft--the ideal method for generating electricity. The centrifugal\r\ngovernor is included on the same base]\r\n\r\nDynamos can be designed for almost any waterwheel speed, and, among\r\nsmall manufacturers especially, there is a disposition to furnish\r\nthese special machines at little advance in price over their stock\r\nmachines. Frequently it is merely a matter of changing the winding on\r\na stock machine. The farmer himself, in many cases, can re-wind an old\r\ndynamo to fit the speed requirements of a direct-connected drive if\r\nthe difference is not too great. All that would be necessary to\r\neffect this change would be to get the necessary winding data from the\r\nmanufacturer himself, and proceed with the winding. This data would\r\ngive the gauge of wire and the number of turns required for each spool\r\nof the field magnets; and the gauge of wire and number of turns\r\nrequired for each slot in the armature. The average boy who has\r\nstudied electricity (and there is something about electricity that\r\nmakes it closer to the boy's heart than his pet dog) could do this\r\nwork. The advantages of direct drive are so many that it should be\r\nused wherever possible.\r\n\r\nWhen direct drive cannot be had, a belt must be used, either from a\r\nmain shaft, or a countershaft. The belt must be of liberal size, and\r\nmust be of the \"endless\" variety--with a scarfed joint. Leather belt\r\nlacing, or even the better grades of wire lacing, unless very\r\ncarefully used, will prove unsatisfactory. The dynamo feels every\r\nvariation in speed, and this is reflected in the lights. There is\r\nnothing quite so annoying as flickering lights. Usually this can be\r\ntraced to the belt connections. Leather lacing forms a knot which\r\ncauses the lights to flicker at each revolution of the belt. The\r\nendless belt does away with this trouble. Most dynamos are provided\r\nwith sliding bases, by which the machine can be moved one way or\r\nanother a few inches, to take up slack in the belt. To take advantage\r\nof this, the belt must be run in a horizontal line, or nearly so.\r\nVertical belting is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is mounted on a wooden base, in a dry location where it is\r\nprotected from the weather, or dampness from any source. It must be\r\nmounted firmly, to prevent vibration when running up to speed; and the\r\nswitchboard should occupy a place within easy reach. Wires running\r\nfrom the dynamo to the switchboard should be protected from injury,\r\nand must be of ample size to carry the full current of the machine\r\nwithout heating. A neat way is to carry them down through the flooring\r\nthrough porcelain tubes, thence to a point where they can be brought\r\nup at the back of the switchboard. If there is any danger of injury to\r\nthese mains they may be enclosed in iron pipe. Keep the wires out of\r\nsight as much as possible, and make all connections on the back of the\r\nswitchboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Switchboard_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connecting switchboard instruments]\r\n\r\nThe switchboard is constructed of some fireproof material, preferably\r\nslate or marble. When the cost of this material is an item to\r\nconsider, build a substantial wooden frame for your switchboard. You\r\ncan then screw asbestos shingles to this to hold the various\r\ninstruments and with a little care such a switchboard can be made to\r\nlook business-like, and it is fully as serviceable as the more\r\nexpensive kind. The switchboard instruments have already been\r\ndescribed briefly. They consist of a voltmeter (to measure voltage);\r\nan ammeter (to measure the strength of the current drawn, in amperes),\r\na rheostat (to regulate the voltage of the machine to suit the\r\nindividual requirements); and the usual switches and fuses. The main\r\nswitch should be so wired that when open it will throw all the current\r\noff the line, but still leave the field coils, the voltmeter, and the\r\nswitchboard lamp in circuit. The main-switch fuses should have a\r\ncapacity about 50 per cent in excess of the full load of the dynamo.\r\nIf the machine is rated for 50 amperes, 75-ampere fuses should be\r\ninstalled. This permits throwing on an overload in an emergency; and\r\nat the same time guards against a short circuit. If the capacity of\r\nthe machine is under 30 amperes, plug fuses, costing 3 cents each, can\r\nbe used. If it is above this capacity, cartridge fuses, costing a\r\nlittle more, are required. A supply of these fuses should be kept\r\nhandy at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Governors and Voltage Regulators_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A centrifugal governor (Courtesy of the C. P. Bradway\r\nCompany, West Stafford, Conn.)]\r\n\r\nThe necessity for water wheel governors will vary with conditions. As\r\na general rule, it may be said that reaction turbines working under a\r\nlow head with a large quantity of water do not require as much\r\ngoverning as the impulse wheel, working under high heads with small\r\nquantities of water. When governing is necessary at all, it is because\r\nthe prime mover varies in speed from no load to full load. Planning\r\none's plant with a liberal allowance of power--two water horsepower to\r\none electrical horsepower is liberal--reduces the necessity of\r\ngovernors to a minimum. As an instance of this, the plant described\r\nin some detail in Chapters One and Six of this volume, runs without a\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\nHowever, a surplus of water-power is not usual. Generally plants are\r\ndesigned within narrow limits; and then the need of a governor becomes\r\nimmediately apparent. There are many designs of governors on the\r\nmarket, the cheapest being of the centrifugal type, in which a pair of\r\nwhirling balls are connected to the water wheel gate by means of\r\ngears, and open or close the gate as the speed lowers or rises.\r\n\r\nConstant speed is necessary because voltage is directly dependent on\r\nspeed. If the speed falls 25 per cent, the voltage falls likewise; and\r\na plant with the voltage varying between such limits would be a\r\nconstant source of annoyance, as well as expense for burned-out lamps.\r\n\r\nSince constant voltage is the result aimed at by the use of a\r\ngovernor, the same result can be attained in other ways, several of\r\nwhich will be explained here briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Over-Compounding_\r\n\r\n(1) Over-compounding the dynamo. This is simple and cheap, if one buys\r\nthe right dynamo in the first instance; or if he can do the\r\nover-compounding himself, by the method described in the concluding\r\nparagraphs of Chapter Seven. If it is found that the speed of the\r\nwater wheel drops 25 per cent between no load and full load, a dynamo\r\nwith field coils over-compounded to this extent would give a fairly\r\nconstant regulation. If you are buying a special dynamo for direct\r\ndrive, your manufacturer can supply you with a machine that will\r\nmaintain constant voltage under the normal variations in speed of your\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A System of Resistances_\r\n\r\n(2) Constant load systems. This system provides that the dynamo shall\r\nbe delivering a fixed amount of current at all times, under which\r\ncircumstances the water wheel would not require regulation, as the\r\ndemands on it would not vary from minute to minute or hour to hour.\r\n\r\nThis system is very simply arranged. It consists of having a set of\r\n\"resistances\" to throw into the circuit, in proportion to the amount\r\nof current used.\r\n\r\nLet us say, as an example, that a 50-ampere generator is used at a\r\npressure of 110 volts; and that it is desirable to work this plant at\r\n80 per cent load, or 40 amperes current draft. When all the lights or\r\nappliances were in use, there would be no outside \"resistance\" in the\r\ncircuit. When none of the lights or appliances were in use (as would\r\nbe the case for many hours during the day) it would be necessary to\r\nconsume this amount of current in some other way--to _waste it_. A\r\nresistance permitting 40 amperes of current to flow, would be\r\nnecessary. Of what size should this resistance be?\r\n\r\nThe answer is had by applying Ohm's Law, explained in Chapter Five.\r\nThe Law in this case, would be read R = E/C. Therefore, in this case R\r\n= 110/40 = 2-3/4 ohms resistance, would be required, switched across\r\nthe mains, to keep the dynamo delivering its normal load.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest form of this resistance would be iron wire. In place of\r\niron wire, German silver wire could be used. German silver wire is to\r\nbe had cheaply, and is manufactured in two grades, 18% and 30%, with a\r\nresistance respectively 18 and 30 times that of copper for the same\r\ngauge. Nichrome wire has a resistance 60 times that of copper; and\r\nmanganin wire has a resistance 65 times that of copper, of the same\r\ngauge.\r\n\r\nFirst figure the number of feet of copper wire suitable for the\r\npurpose. Allowing 500 circular mills for each ampere, the gauge of the\r\nwire should be 40 × 500 = 20,000 circular mills, or approximately No.\r\n7 B. & S. gauge. How many feet of No. 7 copper wire would give a\r\nresistance of 2-3/4 ohms? Referring to the copper wire table, we find\r\nthat it requires 2006.2 of No. 7 wire to make one ohm. Then 2-3/4 ohms\r\nwould require 5,517 feet.\r\n\r\nSince 30 per cent German silver wire is approximately 30 times the\r\nresistance of copper, a No. 7 German silver wire, for this purpose,\r\nwould be 1/30 the length of the copper wire, or 186 feet. If nichrome\r\nwire were used, it would be 1/60th the length of copper for the same\r\ngauge, or 93 feet. This resistance wire can be wound in spirals and\r\nmade to occupy a very small space. As long as it is connected in\r\ncircuit, the energy of the dynamo otherwise consumed as light would be\r\nwasted as heat. This heat could be utilized in the hot water boiler or\r\nstove when the lights were turned off.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, however, the resistance necessary to keep the\r\ndynamo up to full load permanently, would not be furnished by one set\r\nof resistance coils. Each lamp circuit would have a set of resistance\r\ncoils of its own. A double-throw switch would turn off the lamps and\r\nturn on the resistance coils, or _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nLet us say a lamp circuit consisted of 6 carbon lamps, of 16\r\ncandlepower each. It would consume 6 × 1/2 ampere, or 3 amperes of\r\ncurrent, and interpose a resistance of 36.6 ohms--say 37 ohms. Three\r\namperes would require a wire of at least 1,500 circular mills in area\r\nfor safety. This corresponds to a No. 18 wire. A No. 18 copper wire\r\ninterposes a resistance of one ohm, for each 156.5 feet length. For 37\r\nohms, 5,790 feet would be required, for copper wire, which of course\r\nwould be impractical. Dividing by 30 gives 193 feet for 30% German\r\nsilver wire; and dividing by 60 gives 96 feet of nichrome wire of the\r\nsame gauge.\r\n\r\nIt is simple to figure each circuit in this way and to construct\r\nresistance units for each switch. Since the resistance units develop\r\nconsiderable heat, they must be enclosed and protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Home-made Stove or Radiator_\r\n\r\nWhile we are on the subject of resistance coils it might be well here\r\nto describe how to make stoves for cooking, and radiators for heating\r\nthe house, at small expense. These stoves consist merely of\r\nresistances which turn hot--a dull red--when the current is turned on.\r\nIron wire, German silver wire, or the various trade brands of\r\nresistance wire, of which nichrome, calido, and manganin are samples,\r\ncan be used. In buying this wire, procure the table of resistance and\r\ncarrying capacity from the manufacturers. From this table you can make\r\nyour own radiators to keep the house warm in winter. Iron wire has the\r\ndisadvantage of oxidizing when heated to redness, so that it goes to\r\npieces after prolonged use. It is cheap, however, and much used for\r\nresistance in electrical work.\r\n\r\nLet us say we wish to heat a bathroom, a room 6 × 8, and 8 feet\r\nhigh--that is a room containing 384 cubic feet of air space. Allowing\r\n2 watts for each cubic foot, we would require 768 watts of current, or\r\npractically 7 amperes at 110 volts. What resistance would be required\r\nto limit the current to this amount? Apply Ohm's Law, as before, and\r\nwe have R equals E divided by C, or R equals 110 divided by 7, which\r\nis 15.7 ohms. Forty-two feet of No. 20 German silver wire would emit\r\nthis amount of heat and limit the current output to 7 amperes. In the\r\nFar West, it is quite common, in the outlying district, to find\r\nelectric radiators made out of iron pipe covered with asbestos, on\r\nwhich the requisite amount of iron wire is wound and made secure. This\r\npipe is mounted in a metal frame. Or the frame may consist of two\r\npipes containing heating elements; and a switch, in this case, is so\r\narranged that either one or two heating elements may be used at one\r\ntime, according to the weather. An ingenious mechanic can construct\r\nsuch a radiator, experimenting with the aid of an ammeter to ascertain\r\nthe length of wire required for any given stove.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Regulating Voltage at Switchboards_\r\n\r\nThe voltage of any given machine may be regulated, within wide limits,\r\nby means of the field rheostat on the switchboard.\r\n\r\nA dynamo with a rated speed of 1,500 revolutions per minute, for 110\r\nvolts, will actually attain this voltage at as low as 1,200 r.p.m. if\r\nall the regulating resistance be cut out. You can test this fact with\r\nyour own machine by cutting out the resistance from the shunt field\r\nentirely, and starting the machine slowly, increasing its speed\r\ngradually, until the voltmeter needle registers 110 volts. Then\r\nmeasure the speed. It will be far below the rated speed of your\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the speed of such a machine runs up to 2,500 or\r\nover--that is, an excess of 67%--the voltage would rise\r\nproportionally, unless extra resistance was cut in. By cutting in such\r\nresistance--by the simple expedient of turning the rheostat handle on\r\nthe switchboard,--the field coils are so weakened that the voltage is\r\nkept at the desired point in spite of the excessive speed of the\r\nmachine. Excessive speeds are to be avoided, as a rule, because of\r\nmechanical strain. But within a wide range, the switchboard rheostat\r\ncan be used for voltage regulation.\r\n\r\nAs it would be a source of continual annoyance to have to run to the\r\nswitchboard every time the load of the machine was varied greatly this\r\nplan would not be practical for the isolated plant, unless the\r\nrheostat could be installed,--with a voltmeter--in one's kitchen.\r\nThis could be done simply by running a small third wire from the\r\nswitchboard to the house. Then, when the lights became dim from\r\nexcessive load, a turn of the handle would bring them back to the\r\nproper voltage; and when they flared up and burned too bright, a turn\r\nof the handle in the opposite direction would remedy matters. By this\r\nsimple arrangement, any member of the family could attend to voltage\r\nregulation with a minimum of bother.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Automatic Devices_\r\n\r\nThere are several automatic devices for voltage regulation at the\r\nswitchboard on the market. These consist usually of vibrator magnets\r\nor solenoids, in which the strength of the current, varying with\r\ndifferent speeds, reacts in such a way as to regulate field\r\nresistance. Such voltage regulators can be had for $40 or less, and\r\nare thoroughly reliable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo sum up the discussion of governors and voltage regulators: If you\r\ncan allow a liberal proportion of water-power, and avoid crowding\r\nyour dynamo, the chances are you will not need a governor for the\r\nordinary reaction turbine wheel. Start your plant, and let it run for\r\na few days or a few weeks without a governor, or regulator. Then if\r\nyou find the operation is unsatisfactory, decide for yourself which of\r\nthe above systems is best adapted for your conditions. Economy as well\r\nas convenience will affect your decision. The plant which is most\r\nnearly automatic is the best; but by taking a little trouble and\r\ngiving extra attention, a great many dollars may be saved in extras.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Starting the Dynamo_\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to put your plant in operation. Your dynamo has been\r\nmounted on a wooden foundation, and belted to the countershaft, by\r\nmeans of an endless belt.\r\n\r\nSee that the oil cups are filled. Then throw off the main switch and\r\nthe field switch at the switchboard; open the water gate slowly, and\r\noccasionally test the speed of the dynamo. When it comes up to rated\r\nspeed, say 1,500 per minute, let it run for a few minutes, to be sure\r\neverything is all right.\r\n\r\nHaving assured yourself that the mechanical details are all right, now\r\nlook at the voltmeter. It is probably indicating a few volts pressure,\r\nfrom 4 to 8 or 10 perhaps. This pressure is due to the residual\r\nmagnetism in the field cores, as the field coils are not yet\r\nconnected. If by any chance, the needle does not register, or is now\r\nback of 0, try changing about the connections or the voltmeter on the\r\nback of the switchboard.\r\n\r\nNow snap on the field switch. Instantly the needle will begin to move\r\nforward, though slowly; and it will stop. Turn the rheostat handle\r\ngradually; as you advance it, the voltmeter needle will advance.\r\nFinally you will come to a point where the needle will indicate 110\r\nvolts.\r\n\r\nIf you have designed your transmission line for a drop of 5 volts at\r\nhalf-load, advance the rheostat handle still further, until the\r\nneedle points to 115 volts. Let the machine run this way for some\r\ntime. When assured all is right, throw on the main switch, and turn on\r\nthe light at the switchboard. Then go to the house and gradually turn\r\non lights. Come back and inspect the dynamo as the load increases. It\r\nshould not run hot, nor even very warm, up to full load. Its brushes\r\nshould not spark, though a little sparking will do no harm.\r\n\r\nYour plant is now ready to deliver current up to the capacity of its\r\nfuses. See that it does not lack good lubricating oil, and do not let\r\nits commutator get dirty. The commutator should assume a glossy\r\nchocolate brown color. If it becomes dirty, or the brushes spark\r\nbadly, hold a piece of fine sandpaper against it. Never use emery\r\npaper! If, after years of service, it becomes roughened by wear, have\r\nit turned down in a lathe. Occasionally, every few weeks, say, take\r\nthe brushes out and clean them with a cloth. They will wear out in the\r\ncourse of time and can be replaced for a few cents each. The bearings\r\nmay need replacing after several years' continuous use.\r\n\r\nOtherwise your electric plant will take care of itself. Keep it up to\r\nspeed, and keep it clean and well oiled. Never shut it down unless you\r\nhave to. In practice, dynamos run week after week, year after year,\r\nwithout stopping. This one, so long as you keep it running true to\r\nform, will deliver light, heat and power to you for nothing, which\r\nyour city cousin pays for at the rate of 10 cents a kilowatt-hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nGASOLINE ENGINES, WINDMILLS, ETC. THE STORAGE BATTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nGASOLINE ENGINE PLANTS\r\n\r\n     The standard voltage set--Two-cycle and four-cycle gasoline\r\n     engines--Horsepower, and fuel consumption--Efficiency of small\r\n     engines and generators--Cost of operating a one-kilowatt plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nElectricity is of so much value in farm operations, as well as in the\r\nfarm house, that the farmer who is not fortunate enough to possess\r\nwater-power of his own, or to live in a community where a coöperative\r\nhydro-electric plant may be established, should not deny himself its\r\nmany conveniences. In place of the water wheel to turn the dynamo,\r\nthere is the gasoline engine (or other forms of internal combustion\r\nengine using oil, gas, or alcohol as fuel); in many districts where\r\nsteam engines are used for logging or other operations, electricity\r\nmay be generated as a by-product; and almost any windmill capable of\r\npumping water can be made to generate enough electricity for lighting\r\nthe farm house at small expense.\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of water-power is that the expense of\r\nmaintenance--once the plant is installed--is practically nothing. This\r\nadvantage is offset in some measure by the fact that other forms of\r\npower, gas, steam, or windmills, are already installed, in many\r\ninstances and that their judicious use in generating electricity does\r\nnot impair their usefulness for the other farm operations for which\r\nthey were originally purchased. In recent years gasoline engines have\r\ncome into general use on farms as a cheap dependable source of power\r\nfor all operations; and windmills date from the earliest times. They\r\nmay be installed and maintained cheaply, solely for generating\r\nelectricity, if desired. Steam engines, however, require so much care\r\nand expert attention that their use for farm electric plants is not to\r\nbe advised, except under conditions where a small portion of their\r\npower can be used to make electricity as a by-product.\r\n\r\nThere are two types of gasoline engine electric plants suitable for\r\nthe farm, in general use:\r\n\r\nFirst: The Standard Voltage Set, in which the engine and dynamo are\r\nmounted on one base, and the engine is kept running when current is\r\nrequired for any purpose. These sets are usually of the 110-volt type,\r\nand all standard appliances, such as irons, toasters, motors, etc.,\r\nmay be used in connection with them. Since the electricity is drawn\r\ndirectly from the dynamo itself, without a storage battery, it is\r\nnecessary that these engines be efficient and governed as to speed\r\nwithin a five per cent variation from no load to full load.\r\n\r\nSecond: Storage Battery Sets, in which the dynamo is run only a few\r\nhours each week, and the electricity thus generated is \"stored\" by\r\nchemical means, in storage batteries, for use when required. Since, in\r\nthis case, the current is drawn from the battery, instead of the\r\ndynamo, when used for lighting or other purposes, it is not necessary\r\nthat a special type of engine be used to insure constant speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Standard Voltage Set_\r\n\r\nIn response to a general demand, the first type (the direct-connected\r\nstandard voltage set) has been developed to a high state of efficiency\r\nrecently, and is to be had in a great variety of sizes (ranging from\r\none-quarter kilowatt to 25 kilowatts and over) from many\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the gasoline engine as motive power is so familiar to\r\nthe average farmer that it needs but a brief description here.\r\nGasoline or other fuel (oil, gas, or alcohol) is transformed into\r\nvapor, mixed with air in correct proportions, and drawn into the\r\nengine cylinder and there exploded by means of a properly-timed\r\nelectric spark.\r\n\r\nInternal combustion engines are of two general types--four-cycle and\r\ntwo-cycle. The former is by far the more common. In a four-cycle\r\nengine the piston must travel twice up and down in each cylinder, to\r\ndeliver one power stroke. This results in one power impulse in each\r\ncylinder every two revolutions of the crank shaft. On its first down\r\nstroke, the piston sucks in gas. On its first up stroke, it compresses\r\nthe gas. At the height of this stroke, the gas is exploded by means of\r\nthe electric spark and the piston is driven down, on its power stroke.\r\nThe fourth stroke is called the scavening stroke, and expels the\r\nburned gas. This completes the cycle.\r\n\r\nA one-cylinder engine of the ordinary four-cycle type has one power\r\nstroke for every two revolutions of the fly wheel. A two-cylinder\r\nengine has one power stroke for one revolution of the fly wheel; and a\r\nfour-cylinder engine has two power strokes to each revolution. The\r\ngreater the number of cylinders, the more even the flow of power. In\r\nautomobiles six cylinders are common, and in the last year or two,\r\neight-cylinder engines began appearing on the market in large numbers.\r\nA twelve-cylinder engine is the prospect for the immediate future.\r\n\r\nSince the dynamo that is to supply electric current direct to lamps\r\nrequires a steady flow of power, the single-cylinder gas or gasoline\r\nengine of the four-cycle type is not satisfactory as a rule. The\r\nlights will flicker with every other revolution of the fly wheel. This\r\nwould be of no importance if the current was being used to charge a\r\nstorage battery--and right here lies the reason why a cheaper engine\r\nmay be used in connection with a storage battery than when the dynamo\r\nsupplies the current direct for lighting.\r\n\r\nA two-cylinder engine is more even in its flow of power and a\r\nfour-cylinder engine still better. For this reason, standard voltage\r\ngenerating sets without battery are usually of two or four cylinders\r\nwhen of the four-cycle type. When a single-cylinder engine is used, it\r\nshould be of the two-cycle type. In the two-cycle engine, there is one\r\npower stroke to each up-and-down journey of the piston. This effect is\r\nproduced by having inlet and exhaust ports in the crank case, so\r\narranged that, when the piston arrives at the bottom of the power\r\nstroke, the waste gases are pushed out, and fresh gas drawn in before\r\nthe up stroke begins.\r\n\r\nFor direct lighting, the engine must be governed so as not to vary\r\nmore than five per cent in speed between no load and full load. There\r\nare many makes on the market which advertise a speed variation of\r\nthree per cent under normal loads. Governors are usually of the\r\ncentrifugal ball type, integral with the fly wheel, regulating the\r\namount of gas and air supplied to the cylinders in accordance with the\r\nspeed. Thus, if such an engine began to slow down because of increase\r\nin load, the centrifugal balls would come closer together, and open\r\nthe throttle, thus supplying more gas and air and increasing the\r\nspeed. If the speed became excessive, due to sudden shutting off of\r\nlights, the centrifugal balls would fly farther apart, and the\r\nthrottle would close until the speed was again adjusted to the load.\r\n\r\nThese direct-connected standard voltage sets are as a rule fitted with\r\nthe 110-volt, direct current, compound type of dynamo, the duplicate\r\nin every respect of the machine described in previous chapters for\r\nwater-power plants. They are practically automatic in operation and\r\nwill run for hours without attention, except as to oil and gasoline\r\nsupply. They may be installed in the woodshed or cellar without\r\nannoyance due to noise or vibration. It is necessary to start them, of\r\ncourse, when light or power is desired, and to stop them when no\r\ncurrent is being drawn. There have appeared several makes on the\r\nmarket in which starting and stopping are automatic. Storage batteries\r\nare used in connection with these latter plants for starting the\r\nengine. When a light is turned on, or current is drawn for any\r\npurpose, an automatic switch turns the dynamo into a motor, and it\r\nstarts the engine by means of the current stored in the battery.\r\nInstantly the engine has come up to speed, the motor becomes a dynamo\r\nagain and begins to deliver current. When the last light is turned\r\noff, the engine stops automatically.\r\n\r\nSince the installation of a direct-connected standard voltage plant of\r\nthis type is similar in every respect, except as to motive power, to\r\nthe hydro-electric plant, its cost, with this single exception, is the\r\nsame. The same lamps, wire, and devices are used.\r\n\r\nWith gasoline power, the cost of the engine offsets the cost of the\r\nwater wheel. The engine is more expensive than the ordinary gasoline\r\nengine; but even this item of cost is offset by the cost of labor and\r\nmaterials used in installing a water wheel.\r\n\r\nThe expense of maintenance is limited to gasoline and oil.\r\nDepreciation enters in both cases; and though it may be more rapid\r\nwith a gasoline engine than a water wheel, that item will not be\r\nconsidered here. The cost of lubricating oil is inconsiderable. It\r\nwill require, when operated at from one-half load to full load,\r\napproximately one pint of gasoline to each horsepower hour. When\r\noperated at less than half-load, its efficiency lowers. Thus, for a\r\nquarter-load, an average engine of this type may require three pints\r\nof gasoline for each horsepower hour. For this reason it is well, in\r\ninstalling such a plant, to have it of such size that it will be\r\noperating on at least three-fourths load under normal draft of\r\ncurrent. Norman H. Schneider, in his book \"Low Voltage Electric\r\nLighting,\" gives the following table of proportions between the engine\r\nand dynamo:\r\n\r\n     Actual watts    Actual Horsepower    Nearest engine size\r\n       150                   .5                 1/2\r\n       225                   .7                 3/4\r\n       300                   .86              1\r\n       450                  1.12              1-1/4\r\n       600                  1.5               1-1/2\r\n       750                  1.7               1-3/4\r\n      1000                  2.3               2-1/2\r\n      2000                  4.5               5\r\n      4000                  9.0              10\r\n\r\nThis table is figured for an efficiency of only 40 per cent for the\r\nsmaller generators, and 60 per cent for the larger. In machines from 5\r\nto 25 kilowatts, the efficiency will run considerably higher.\r\n\r\nTo determine the expense of operating a one-kilowatt gasoline\r\ngenerator set of this type, as to gasoline consumption, we can assume\r\nat full load that the gasoline engine is delivering 2-1/2 horsepower,\r\nand consuming, let us say, 1-1/4 pint of gasoline for each horsepower\r\nhour (to make allowance for lower efficiency in small engines). That\r\nwould be 3.125 pints of gasoline per hour. Allowing a ten per cent\r\nloss of current in wiring, we have 900 watts of electricity to use,\r\nfor this expenditure of gasoline. This would light 900 ÷ 25 = 36 lamps\r\nof 25 watts each, a liberal allowance for house and barn, and\r\npermitting the use of small cooking devices and other conveniences\r\nwhen part of the lights were not in use. With gasoline selling at 12\r\ncents a gallon, the use of this plant for an hour at full capacity\r\nwould cost $0.047. Your city cousin pays 9 cents for the same current\r\non a basis of 10 cents per kilowatt-hour; and in smaller towns where\r\nthe rate is 15 cents, he would pay 13-1/2 cents.\r\n\r\nRunning this plant at only half-load--that is, using only 18 lights,\r\nor their equivalent--would reduce the price to about 3 cents an\r\nhour--since the efficiency decreases with smaller load. It is\r\ncustomary to figure an average of 3-1/2 hours a day throughout the\r\nyear, for all lights. On this basis the cost of gasoline for this\r\none-kilowatt plant would be 16-1/2 cents a day for full load, and\r\napproximately 10-1/2 cents a day for half-load. This is extremely\r\nfavorable, as compared with the cost of electric current in our cities\r\nand towns, at the commercial rate, especially when one considers that\r\nlight and power are to be had at any place or at any time on the farm\r\nsimply by starting the engine. A smaller plant, operating at less cost\r\nfor fuel, would furnish ample light for most farms; but it is well to\r\nremember in this connection plants smaller than one kilowatt are\r\npractical for light only, since electric irons, toasters, etc., draw\r\nfrom 400 to 660 watts each. Obviously a plant of 300 watts capacity\r\nwould not permit the use of these instruments, although it would\r\nfurnish 10 or 12 lamps of 25 watts each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE STORAGE BATTERY\r\n\r\n     What a storage battery does--The lead battery and the Edison\r\n     battery--Economy of tungsten lamps for storage batteries--The\r\n     low-voltage battery for electric light--How to figure the capacity\r\n     of a battery--Table of light requirements for a farm\r\n     house--Watt-hours and lamp-hours--The cost of storage battery\r\n     current--How to charge a storage battery--Care of storage\r\n     batteries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the man who has a small supply of water to run a water wheel a few\r\nhours at a time, or who wishes to store electricity while he is doing\r\nroutine jobs with a gasoline engine or other source of power, the\r\nstorage battery solves the problem. The storage battery may be likened\r\nto a tank of water which is drawn on when water is needed, and which\r\nmust be re-filled when empty. A storage battery, or accumulator is a\r\ndevice in which a chemical action is set up when an electric current\r\nis passed through it. This is called _charging_. When such a battery\r\nis charged, it has the property of giving off an electric current by\r\nmeans of a reversed chemical action when a circuit is provided,\r\nthrough a lamp or other connection. This reversed action is called\r\n_discharging_. Such a battery will discharge nearly as much current as\r\nis required originally to bring about the first chemical action.\r\n\r\nThere are two common types of storage battery--the lead accumulator,\r\nmade up of lead plates (alternately positive and negative); and the\r\ntwo-metal accumulator, of which the Edison battery is a\r\nrepresentative, made up of alternate plates of iron and nickel. In the\r\nlead accumulator, the \"positive\" plate may be recognized by its brown\r\ncolor when charging, while the \"negative\" plate is usually light gray,\r\nor leaden in color. The action of the charging current is to form\r\noxides of lead in the plates; the action of the discharging current is\r\nto reduce the oxides to metallic lead again. This process can be\r\nrepeated over and over again during the life of the battery.\r\n\r\nBecause of the cost of the batteries themselves, it is possible (from\r\nthe viewpoint of the farmer and the size of his pocketbook) to store\r\nonly a relatively small amount of electric current. For this reason,\r\nthe storage battery was little used for private plants, where expense\r\nis a considerable item, up to a few years ago. Carbon lamps require\r\nfrom 3-1/2 to 4 watts for each candlepower of light they give out; and\r\na lead battery capable of storing enough electricity to supply the\r\naverage farm house with light by means of carbon lamps for three or\r\nfour days at a time without recharging, proved too costly for private\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tungsten Lamp_\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the new tungsten lamp, however, reducing the\r\ncurrent requirements for light by two-thirds, the storage battery\r\nimmediately came into its own, and is now of general use.\r\n\r\nSince incandescent lamps were first invented scientists have been\r\ntrying to find some metal of high fusion to use in place of the carbon\r\nfilament of the ordinary lamp. The higher the fusing point of this\r\nfilament of wire, the more economical would be the light. Edison\r\nsought, thirty years ago, for just the qualities now found in tungsten\r\nmetal. Tungsten metal was first used for incandescent lamps in the\r\nform of a paste, squirted into the shape of a thread. This proved too\r\nfragile. Later investigators devised means of drawing tungsten into\r\nwire; and it is tungsten wire that is now used so generally in\r\nlighting. A tungsten lamp has an average efficiency of 1-1/4 watts per\r\ncandlepower, compared with 3-1/2 to 4 watts of the old-style carbon\r\nlamp. In larger sizes the efficiency is as low as .9 watt per\r\ncandlepower; and only recently it has been found that if inert\r\nnitrogen gas is used in the glass bulb, instead of using a high vacuum\r\nas is the general practice, the efficiency of the lamp becomes still\r\nhigher, approaching .5 watt for each candlepower in large lamps. This\r\nnew nitrogen lamp is not yet being manufactured in small domestic\r\nsizes, though it will undoubtedly be put on the market in those sizes\r\nin the near future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Fairbanks Morse oil engine storage battery set]\r\n\r\nThe tungsten lamp, requiring only one-third as much electric current\r\nas the carbon lamp, for the same amount of light, reduces the size\r\n(and the cost) of the storage battery in the same degree, thus\r\nbringing the storage battery within the means of the farmer. Some idea\r\nof the power that may be put into a small storage battery is to be had\r\nfrom the fact that a storage battery of only 6 volts pressure, such as\r\nis used in self-starters on automobiles, will turn a motor and crank a\r\nheavy six-cylinder engine; or it will run the automobile, without\r\ngasoline, for a mile or more with its own accumulated store of\r\nelectric current.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Low Voltage Battery_\r\n\r\nThe 30-volt storage battery has become standard for small lighting\r\nplants, since the introduction of the tungsten lamp. Although the\r\nvoltage of each separate cell of this battery registers 2.5 volts when\r\nfully charged, it falls to approximately 2 volts per cell immediately\r\ndischarging begins. For this reason, it is customary to figure the\r\nworking pressure of each cell at 2 volts. This means that a 30-volt\r\nbattery should consist of at least 15 cells. Since, however, the\r\nvoltage falls below 2 for each cell, as discharging proceeds, it is\r\nusual to include one additional cell for regulating purposes. Thus,\r\nthe ordinary 30-volt storage battery consists of 16 cells, the last\r\ncell in the line remaining idle until the lamps begin to dim, when it\r\nis switched in by means of a simple arrangement of connections. This\r\nmaintains a uniform pressure of 30 volts from the beginning to the end\r\nof the charge, at the lamp socket.\r\n\r\nWe saw in earlier chapters that the 110-volt current is the most\r\nsatisfactory, under all conditions, where the current is to be used\r\nfor heating and small power, as well as light. But a storage battery\r\nof 110 volts would require at least 55 cells, which would make it too\r\nexpensive for ordinary farm use. As a 30-volt current is just as\r\nsatisfactory for electric light, this type has become established, in\r\nconnection with the battery, and it is used for electric lighting\r\nonly, as a general rule.\r\n\r\nBatteries are rated first, as to voltage; second, as to their capacity\r\nin ampere hours--that is, the number of amperes that may be drawn from\r\nthem in a given number of hours. Thus, a battery rated at 60 ampere\r\nhours would give 60 amperes, at 30 volts pressure, for one hour; 30\r\namperes for 2 hours; 15 amperes for 4 hours; 7-1/2 amperes for 8\r\nhours; 3-3/4 amperes for 16 hours; etc., etc. In practice, a battery\r\nshould not be discharged faster than its 8-hour rate. Thus, a\r\n60-ampere hour battery should not be drawn on at a greater rate than\r\n7-1/2 amperes per hour.\r\n\r\nThis 8-hour rate also determines the rate at which a battery should\r\nbe re-charged, once it is exhausted. Thus, this battery should be\r\ncharged at the rate of 7-1/2 amperes for 8 hours, with another hour\r\nadded to make up for losses that are bound to occur. A battery of\r\n120-ampere hour capacity should be charged for 8 or 9 hours at the\r\nrate of 120 ÷ 8, or 15 amperes, etc.\r\n\r\nTo determine the size of battery necessary for any particular\r\ninstance, it is necessary first to decide on the number of lamps\r\nrequired, and their capacity. Thirty-volt lamps are to be had in the\r\nmarket in sizes of 10, 15 and 20 watts; they yield respectively 8, 12,\r\nand 16 candlepower each. Of these the 20-watt lamp is the most\r\nsatisfactory for the living rooms; lamps of 10 or 15 watts may be used\r\nfor the halls, the bathroom and the bedrooms. At 30 volts pressure\r\nthese lamps would require a current of the following density in\r\namperes:\r\n\r\n     Candle\r\n     Power     30-volt lamp    Amperes\r\n       8         10 watts        0.33\r\n      12         15 watts        0.50\r\n      16         20 watts        0.67\r\n\r\nLet us assume, as an example, that Farmer Brown will use 20-watt\r\nlamps in his kitchen, dining room, and sitting room; and 10-watt lamps\r\nin the halls, bathroom, and bedrooms. His requirements may be figured\r\neither in lamp hours or in watt-hours. Since he is using two sizes of\r\nlamps, it will be simpler to figure his requirements in watt-hours.\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n                          Number     Size of   Hours    Watt-\r\n          Room          of lamps     lamps     burned   hours\r\n\r\n         Kitchen           1           20        4       80\r\n         Dining room       2           20        2       80\r\n         Sitting room      3           20        4      240\r\n    (3)  Bedrooms          1 (each)    10        1       30\r\n         Bathroom          1           10        2       20\r\n    (2)  Halls             1 (each)    10        4       80\r\n         Pantry            1           10        1       10\r\n         Cellar            1           10        1       10\r\n                                                       ----\r\n           Total                                        550\r\n\r\nSince amperes equal watts divided by volts, the number of ampere hours\r\nrequired in this case each night would be 550 ÷ 30 = 18.3 ampere\r\nhours; or approximately 4-1/2 amperes per hour for 4 hours.\r\n\r\nSay it is convenient to charge this battery every fourth day. This\r\nwould require a battery of 4 × 18.3 ampere hours, or 73.2 ampere\r\nhours. The nearest size on the market is the 80-ampere hour battery,\r\nwhich would be the one to use for this installation.\r\n\r\nTo charge this battery would require a dynamo capable of delivering 10\r\namperes of current for 9 hours. The generator should be of 45 volts\r\npressure (allowing 2-1/2 volts in the generator for each 2 volts of\r\nbattery) and the capacity of the generator would therefore be 450\r\nwatts. This would require a 1-1/4 horsepower gasoline engine. At 1-1/4\r\npints of gasoline for each horsepower, nine hours work of this engine\r\nwould consume 14 pints of gasoline--or say 16 pints, or two gallons.\r\nAt 12 cents a gallon for gasoline, lighting your house with this\r\nbattery would cost 24 cents for four days, or 6 cents a day. Your city\r\ncousin, using commercial current, would pay 5-1/2 cents a day for the\r\nsame amount of current at 10 cents a kilowatt-hour; or 8-1/4 cents at\r\na 15-cent rate. If the battery is charged by the farm gasoline engine\r\nat the same time it is doing its other work, the cost would be still\r\nless, as the extra gasoline required would be small.\r\n\r\nThis figure does not take into account depreciation of battery and\r\nengine. The average farmer is too apt to overlook this factor in\r\nfiguring the cost of machinery of all kinds, and for that reason is\r\nunprepared when the time comes to replace worn-out machinery. The\r\ndynamo and switchboard should last a lifetime with ordinary care, so\r\nthere is no depreciation charge against them. The storage battery, a\r\n30-volt, 80-ampere hour installation, should not cost in excess of\r\n$100; and, if it is necessary to buy a gasoline engine, a 1-1/4\r\nhorsepower engine can be had for $50 or less according to the type.\r\nStorage batteries of the lead type are sold under a two-years'\r\nguarantee--which does not mean that their life is limited to that\r\nlength of time. With good care they may last as long as 10 years; with\r\npoor care it may be necessary to throw them away at the end of a year.\r\nThe engine should be serviceable for at least 10 years, with ordinary\r\nreplacements; and the storage battery may last from 6 to 10 years,\r\nwith occasional renewal of parts. If it were necessary to duplicate\r\nboth at the end of ten years, this would make a carrying charge of\r\n$1.25 a month for depreciation, which must be added to the cost of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Figuring by Lamp Hours_\r\n\r\nIf all the lamps are to be of the same size--either ten, fifteen, or\r\ntwenty watts, the light requirements of a farm house can be figured\r\nreadily by lamp hours. In that event, the foregoing table would read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n                                             Lamp hours\r\n    Kitchen, 1 lamp, 4 hours                      4\r\n    Sitting room, 3 lamps, 4 hours each          12\r\n    Dining room, 2 lamps, 2 hours each            4\r\n    Bedrooms, 3 lamps, 1 hour each                3\r\n    Halls, 2 lamps, 4 hours each                  8\r\n    Bathroom, 1 lamp, 2 hours                     2\r\n    Pantry and cellar, 2 lamps, 1 hour each       2\r\n\r\nTo determine the ampere hours from this table, multiply the total\r\nnumber of lamp hours by the current in amperes required for each lamp.\r\nAs 10, 15, and 20-watt tungsten lamps require .33, .50 and .67\r\namperes, respectively at 30 volts pressure, the above requirements in\r\nampere hours would be 12, 17-1/2, or 24 ampere hours, according to the\r\nsize of lamp chosen. This gives the average current consumption for\r\none night. If it is desired to charge the battery twice a week on the\r\naverage, multiply the number of lamp hours by 4, to get the size of\r\nbattery required.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing illustration is not intended to indicate average light\r\nrequirements for farms, but is given merely to show how a farmer may\r\nfigure his own requirements. In some instances, it will be necessary\r\nto install a battery of 120 or more ampere hours, whereas a battery of\r\n40 or 60 ampere hours would be quite serviceable in other instances.\r\nIt all depends on how much light you wish to use and are willing to\r\npay for, because with a storage battery the cost of electric light is\r\ndirectly in proportion to the number of lights used.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, a larger generator and engine are required for a\r\nlarger battery--although it is possible to charge a large battery\r\nwith a small generator and engine by taking more time for the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How to Charge a Storage Battery_\r\n\r\nDirect current only can be used for charging storage batteries. In the\r\nrare instance of alternating current only being available, it must be\r\nconverted into direct current by any one of the many mechanical,\r\nchemical, or electrical devices on the market--that is, the\r\nalternating current must be straightened out, to flow always in one\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nA shunt-wound dynamo must be used; else, when the voltage of the\r\nbattery rises too high, it may \"back up\" and turn the dynamo as a\r\nmotor, causing considerable damage. If a compound dynamo is already\r\ninstalled, or if it is desired to use such a machine for charging\r\nstorage batteries, it can be done simply by disconnecting the series\r\nwindings on the field coils, thus turning the machine into a shunt\r\ndynamo.\r\n\r\nThe voltage of the dynamo should be approximately 50 per cent above\r\nthe working pressure of the battery. For this reason 45-volt machines\r\nare usually used for 30 or 32-volt batteries. Higher voltages may be\r\nused, if convenient. Thus a 110-volt dynamo may be used to charge a\r\nsingle 2-volt cell if necessary, although it is not advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Direction of Current_\r\n\r\nElectricity flows from the positive to the negative terminal. A\r\ncharging current must be so connected that the negative wire of the\r\ndynamo is always connected to the negative terminal of the battery,\r\nand the positive wire to the positive terminal. As the polarity is\r\nalways marked on the battery, there is little danger of making a\r\nmistake in this particular.\r\n\r\nWhen the storage battery is charged, and one begins to use its\r\naccumulation of energy, the current comes out in the opposite\r\ndirection from which it entered in charging. In this respect, a\r\nstorage battery is like a clock spring, which is wound up in one\r\ndirection, and unwinds itself in the other. With all storage battery\r\noutfits, an ammeter (or current measure) is supplied with zero at the\r\ncenter. When the battery is being charged, the indicating needle\r\npoints in one direction in proportion to the strength of the current\r\nflowing in; and when the battery is being discharged, the needle\r\npoints in the opposite direction, in proportion to the strength of the\r\ncurrent flowing out.\r\n\r\nSometimes one is at loss, in setting about to connect a battery and\r\ngenerator, to know which is the positive and which the negative wire\r\nof the generator. A very simple test is as follows:\r\n\r\nStart the generator and bring it up to speed. Connect some form of\r\nresistance in \"series\" with the mains. A lamp in an ordinary lamp\r\nsocket will do very well for this resistance. Dip the two ends of the\r\nwire (one coming from the generator, the other through the lamp) into\r\na cup of water, in which a pinch of salt is dissolved. Bring them\r\nalmost together and hold them there. Almost instantly, one wire will\r\nbegin to turn bright, and give off bubbles. The wire which turns\r\nbright and gives off bubbles is the _negative_ wire. The other is the\r\npositive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A rough-and-ready farm electric plant, supplying two\r\nfarms with light, heat and power; and a Ward Leonard-type\r\ncircuit-breaker for charging storage batteries]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Care of Battery_\r\n\r\nSince specific directions are furnished with all storage batteries, it\r\nis not necessary to go into the details of their care here. Storage\r\nbattery plants are usually shipped with all connections made, or\r\nplainly indicated. All that is necessary is to fill the batteries with\r\nthe acid solution, according to directions, and start the engine. If\r\nthe engine is fitted with a governor, and the switchboard is of the\r\nautomatic type, all the care necessary in charging is to start the\r\nengine. In fact, many makes utilize the dynamo as a \"self-starter\" for\r\nthe engine, so that all that is necessary to start charging is to\r\nthrow a switch which starts the engine. When the battery is fully\r\ncharged, the engine is stopped automatically.\r\n\r\nThe \"electrolyte\" or solution in which the plates of the lead battery\r\nare immersed, is sulphuric acid, diluted with water in the proportion\r\nof one part of acid to five of water, by volume.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of ordinary commercial sulphuric acid is 1.835.\r\nSince its strength is apt to vary, however, it is best to mix the\r\nelectrolyte with the aid of the hydrometer furnished with the battery.\r\nThe hydrometer is a sealed glass tube, with a graduated scale somewhat\r\nresembling a thermometer. The height at which it floats in any given\r\nsolution depends on the density of the solution. It should indicate\r\napproximately 1.15 for a storage battery electrolyte before charging.\r\nIt should not be over 1.15--or 1,150 if your hydrometer reads in\r\nthousandths.\r\n\r\nOnly pure water should be used. Distilled water is the best, but fresh\r\nclean rain water is permissible. Never under any circumstances use\r\nhydrant water, as it contains impurities which will injure the\r\nbattery, probably put it out of commission before its first charge.\r\n\r\n_Pour the acid into the water._ Never under any circumstances pour the\r\nwater into the acid, else an explosion may occur from the heat\r\ndeveloped. Mix the electrolyte in a stone crock, or glass container,\r\nstirring with a glass rod, and testing from time to time with a\r\nhydrometer. Let it stand until cool and then pour it into the battery\r\njars, filling them to 1/2 inch above the top of the plates.\r\n\r\nThen begin charging. The first charge will probably take a longer time\r\nthan subsequent charges. If the installation is of the automatic type,\r\nall that is necessary is to start the engine. If it is not of the\r\nautomatic type, proceed as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst be sure all connections are right. Then start the engine and\r\nbring the dynamo up to its rated speed. Adjust the voltage to the\r\npressure specified. Then throw the switch connecting generator to\r\nbattery. Watch the ammeter. It should register in amperes, one-eighth\r\nof the ampere-hour capacity of the battery, as already explained. If\r\nit registers too high, reduce the voltage of the generator slightly,\r\nby means of the field rheostat connected to the generator. This will\r\nalso reduce the amperes flowing. If too low, raise the voltage until\r\nthe amperes register correctly. Continue the charging operation until\r\nthe cells begin to give off gas freely; or until the specific gravity\r\nof the electrolyte, measured by the hydrometer, stands at 1.24. Your\r\nbattery is now fully charged. Throw the switch over to the service\r\nline, and your accumulator is ready to furnish light if you turn on\r\nyour lamps.\r\n\r\nOccasionally add distilled water to the cells, to make up for\r\nevaporation. It is seldom necessary to add acid, as this does not\r\nevaporate. If the battery is kept fully charged, it will not freeze\r\neven when the thermometer is well below zero.\r\n\r\nA storage battery should be installed as near the house as\r\npossible--in the house, if possible. Since its current capacity is\r\nsmall, transmission losses must be reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIn wiring the house for storage battery service, the same rules apply\r\nas with standard voltage. Not more than 6 amperes should be used on\r\nany single branch circuit. With low voltage batteries (from 12 volts\r\nto 32 volts) it is well to use No. 10 or No. 12 B. & S. gauge\r\nrubber-covered wire, instead of the usual No. 14 used with standard\r\nvoltage. The extra expense will be only a few cents for each circuit,\r\nand precious volts will be saved in distribution of the current.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBATTERY CHARGING DEVICES\r\n\r\n     The automatic plant most desirable--How an automobile lighting and\r\n     starting system works--How the same results can be achieved in\r\n     house lighting, by means of automatic devices--Plants without\r\n     automatic regulation--Care necessary--The use of heating devices on\r\n     storage battery current--Portable batteries--An electricity\r\n     \"route\"--Automobile power for lighting a few lamps.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe water-power electric plants described in preceding chapters are\r\npractically automatic in operation. This is very desirable, as such\r\nplants require the minimum of care. It is possible to attain this same\r\nend with a storage battery plant.\r\n\r\nAutomatic maintenance approaches a high degree of perfection in the\r\nelectric starting and lighting device on a modern automobile. In this\r\ncase, a small dynamo geared to the main shaft is running whenever the\r\nengine is running. It is always ready to \"pump\" electricity into the\r\nstorage battery when needed. An electric magnet, wound in a peculiar\r\nmanner, automatically cuts off the charging current from the dynamo,\r\nwhen the battery is \"full;\" and the same magnet, or \"regulator,\"\r\npermits the current to flow into the battery when needed. The\r\nprinciple is the same as in the familiar plumbing trap, which\r\nconstantly maintains a given level of water in a tank, no matter how\r\nmuch water may be drawn from the tank. The result, in the case of the\r\nautomobile battery, is that the battery is always kept fully charged;\r\nfor no sooner does the \"level\" of electricity begin to drop (when used\r\nfor starting or lighting) than the generator begins to charge. This is\r\nvery desirable in more ways than one. In the first place, the energy\r\nof the battery is always the same; and in the second place, the mere\r\nfact that the battery is always kept fully charged gives it a long\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe same result can be achieved in storage battery plants for house\r\nlighting, where the source of power is a gasoline or other engine\r\nengaged normally in other work. Then your electric current becomes\r\nmerely a by-product of some other operation.\r\n\r\nTake a typical instance where such a plant would be feasible: Farmer\r\nBrown has a five horsepower gasoline engine--an ordinary farm engine\r\nfor which he paid probably $75 or $100. Electric light furnished\r\ndirect from such an engine would be intolerable because of its\r\nconstant flickering. This five horsepower engine is installed in the\r\nmilk room of the dairy, and is belted to a countershaft. This\r\ncountershaft is belted to the vacuum pump for the milking machine, and\r\nto the separator, and to a water pump, any one of which may be thrown\r\ninto service by means of a tight-and-loose pulley. This countershaft\r\nis also belted to a small dynamo, which runs whenever the engine is\r\nrunning. The milking machine, the separator, and the water pump\r\nrequire that the gasoline engine be run on the average three hours\r\neach day.\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is connected by wires to the house storage battery through\r\na properly designed switchboard. The \"brains\" of this switchboard is\r\na little automatic device (called a regulator or a circuit breaker),\r\nwhich opens and shuts according to the amount of current stored in the\r\nbattery and the strength of the current from the generator. When the\r\nbattery is \"full,\" this regulator is \"open\" and permits no current to\r\nflow. Then the dynamo is running idle, and the amount of power it\r\nabsorbs from the gasoline engine is negligible. When the \"level\" of\r\nelectricity in the battery falls, due to drawing current for light,\r\nthe regulator is \"shut,\" that is, the dynamo and battery are\r\nconnected, and current flows into the battery.\r\n\r\nThese automatic instruments go still farther in their brainy work.\r\nThey do not permit the dynamo to charge the battery when the voltage\r\nfalls below a fixed point, due to the engine slowing down; neither do\r\nthey permit the dynamo current to flow when the voltage gets too high\r\ndue to sudden speeding up of the engine.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, an instrument which will take care of a battery in this\r\nway, is intricate in construction. That is not an argument against it\r\nhowever. A watch is intricate, but so long as we continue to wind it\r\nat stated intervals, it keeps time. So with this storage battery\r\nplant: so long as Farmer Brown starts his engine to do his farm chores\r\nevery day, his by-product of electricity is stored automatically.\r\n\r\nSuch installations are not expensive. A storage battery capable of\r\nlighting 8 tungsten lamps, of 16 candlepower each, continuously for 8\r\nhours (or fewer lamps for a longer time); a switchboard containing all\r\nthe required regulating instruments; and a dynamo of suitable size,\r\ncan be had for from $250 to $300. All that is necessary to put such a\r\nplant in operation, is to belt the dynamo to the gasoline engine so\r\nthat it will run at proper speed; and to connect the wires from dynamo\r\nto switchboard, and thence to the house service. The dynamo required\r\nfor the above plant delivers 10 amperes at 45 volts pressure, or 10 ×\r\n45 = 450 watts. A gasoline, gas, or oil engine, or a windmill of\r\n1-1/2 horsepower furnishes all the power needed. If the farmer uses\r\nhis engine daily, or every other day, for other purposes, the cost of\r\npower will be practically negligible. With this system electric lights\r\nare available at any time day or night; and when the gasoline engine\r\nis in service daily for routine farm chores, the battery will never\r\nrun low.\r\n\r\nThis system is especially desirable where one uses a windmill for\r\npower. The speed of the windmill is constantly fluctuating, so much so\r\nin fact that it could not be used for electric light without a storage\r\nbattery. But when equipped with a regulator on the switchboard which\r\npermits the current to flow only when the battery needs it, and then\r\nonly when the speed of the windmill is correct, the problem of turning\r\nwind power into electric light is solved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf the farmer does not desire to go to the additional expense of\r\nautomatic regulation, there are cheaper plants, requiring attention\r\nfor charging. These plants are identical with those described above,\r\nexcept they have no regulators. With these plants, when the battery\r\nruns low (as is indicated by dimming of the lights) it is necessary to\r\nstart the engine, bring it up to speed, adjust the dynamo voltage to\r\nthe proper pressure, and throw a switch to charge the battery. For\r\nsuch plants it is customary to run the engine to charge the battery\r\ntwice a week. It is necessary to run the engine from 8 to 10 hours to\r\nfully charge the discharged battery. When the battery approaches full\r\ncharge, the fact is evidenced by so-called \"gassing\" or giving off of\r\nbubbles. Another way to determine if the battery is fully charged is\r\nby means of the voltmeter, as the volts slowly rise to the proper\r\npoint during the process of charging. A third way, and probably the\r\nmost reliable is by the use of the hydrometer. The voltage of each\r\ncell when fully charged should be 2.5; it should never be discharged\r\nbelow 1.75 volts. Many storage battery electric light plants on the\r\nmarket are provided with a simple and inexpensive circuit breaker,\r\nwhich automatically cuts off the current and stops the engine when the\r\nbattery is charged. The current is then thrown from the dynamo to the\r\nhouse service by an automatic switch. If such a circuit breaker is not\r\nincluded, it is necessary to throw the switch by hand when charging is\r\nbegun or ended.\r\n\r\nSince the principal item of first cost, as well as depreciation, in a\r\nstorage battery electric light plant is the storage battery itself,\r\nthe smallest battery commensurate with needs is selected. Since the\r\namount of current stored by these batteries is relatively small,\r\nelectric irons and heating devices such as may be used freely on a\r\ndirect-connected plant without a battery, are rather expensive\r\nluxuries. For instance, an electric iron drawing 400 watts an hour\r\nwhile in use, requires as much energy as 20 tungsten lamps of 16\r\ncandlepower each burning for the same length of time. Its rate of\r\ncurrent consumption would be over 13 amperes, at 30 volts; which would\r\nrequire a larger battery than needed for light in the average farm\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe use to which electricity from a storage battery is put, however,\r\nis wholly a matter of expense involved; and if one is willing to pay\r\nfor these rather expensive luxuries, there is no reason why he should\r\nnot have them. Heating, in any form, by electricity, requires a large\r\namount of current proportionally. As a matter of fact, there is less\r\nheat to be had in thermal units from a horsepower-hour of electricity\r\nthan from three ounces of coal. When one is generating current from\r\nwater-power, or even direct from gasoline or oil, this is not an\r\nargument against electric heating devices. But it becomes a very\r\nserious consideration when one is installing a storage battery as the\r\nsource of current, because of the high initial cost, and depreciation\r\nof such a battery.\r\n\r\nFarmers who limit the use of their storage battery plants to lighting\r\nwill get the best service.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Portable Batteries_\r\n\r\nAbroad it is becoming quite common for power companies to deliver\r\nstorage batteries fully charged, and call for them when discharged.\r\nWithout a stretch of the imagination, we can imagine an ingenious\r\nfarmer possessing a water-power electric plant building up a thriving\r\nbusiness among his less fortunate neighbors, with an \"electricity\"\r\nroute. It could be made quite as paying as a milk route.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Connections for charging storage batteries on 110-volt\r\nmains]\r\n\r\nMany communities have water or steam power at a distance too great to\r\ntransmit 110-volt current by wire economically; and because of lack of\r\nexpert supervision, they do not care to risk using current at a\r\npressure of 500 volts or higher, because of its danger to human life.\r\n\r\nIn such a case it would be quite feasible for families to wire their\r\nhouses, and carry their batteries to the generating plant two or\r\nthree times a week to be charged. There are a number of portable\r\nbatteries on the market suitable for such service, at voltages ranging\r\nfrom 6 to 32 volts. The best results would be obtained by having two\r\nbatteries, leaving one to be charged while the other was in use; and\r\nif the generating station was located at the creamery or feed mill,\r\nwhere the farmer calls regularly, the trouble would be reduced to a\r\nminimum.\r\n\r\nSuch a battery would necessarily be small, and of the sealed type,\r\nsimilar to those used in automobiles. It could be used merely for\r\nreading lamps--or it could be used for general lighting, according to\r\nthe expense the farmer is willing to incur for batteries.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary storage battery used in automobile ignition and lighting\r\nsystems is of the 6-volt, 60-ampere type, called in trade a \"6-60.\"\r\nLamps can be had for these batteries ranging in sizes from 2\r\ncandlepower to 25 candlepower. A lamp of 15 candlepower, drawing 2-1/2\r\namperes, is used for automobile headlights, and, as any one knows\r\nafter an experience of meeting a headlight on a dark road, they give a\r\ngreat deal of light. A \"6-60\" battery keeps one of these lamps running\r\nfor 24 hours, or two lamps running 12 hours. A minimum of wiring would\r\nbe required to install such a battery for the reading lights in the\r\nsitting room, and for a hanging light in the dining room. The\r\ncustomary gates for charging these batteries in a large city is 10\r\ncents; but in a country plant it could be made less.\r\n\r\nTo charge such a battery on a 110-volt direct current, it is necessary\r\nto install some means of limiting the amount of current, or in other\r\nwords, the charging rate. This charging rate, for 8 hours should be,\r\nas we have seen, one-eighth of the ampere-hour capacity of the\r\nbattery. Thus a \"6-60\" battery would require a 7-1/2 ampere current.\r\n\r\nConnecting two such batteries in \"series\" (that is, the negative pole\r\nof one battery to the positive pole of the second) would make a\r\n12-volt battery. Ten or twelve such batteries could be connected in\r\n\"series,\" and a 110-volt direct current generator would charge them in\r\n8 hours at a 7-1/2 ampere rate.\r\n\r\nThe diagram on page 259 shows the connections for charging on a\r\n110-volt circuit.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary 16-candlepower carbon lamp is of 220 ohms resistance, and\r\n(by Ohm's Law, C equals E divided by R) permits 1/2 ampere of current\r\nto flow. By connecting 15 such lamps across the mains, in parallel,\r\nthe required 7-1/2 amperes of current would be flowing from the\r\ngenerator through the lamps, and back again. Connect the battery in\r\n\"series\" at any point on either of the two mains, between the lamps\r\nand the generator, being careful to connect the positive end to the\r\npositive pole of the battery, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nLamps are the cheapest form of resistance; but in case they are not\r\navailable, any other form of resistance can be used. Iron wire wound\r\nin spirals can be used, or any of the many makes of special resistance\r\nwire on the market. First it is necessary to determine the amount of\r\nresistance required.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen that the charging rate of a 60-ampere hour battery\r\nis 7-1/2 amperes. Applying Ohm's Law here, we find that ohms\r\nresistance equals volts divided by amperes, or R = 110/7.5 = 14.67\r\nohms. With a 220-volt current, the ohms resistance required in series\r\nwith the storage battery of this size would be 29.33 ohms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Automobile Power for Lighting_\r\n\r\nThere are many ingenious ways by which an automobile may be utilized\r\nto furnish electric light for the home. The simplest is to run wires\r\ndirect from the storage battery of the self-starting system, to the\r\nhouse or barn, in such a way that the current may be used for reading\r\nlamps in the sitting room. By a judicious use of the current in this\r\nway, the normal operation of the automobile in the daytime will keep\r\nthe battery charged for use of the night lamps, and if care is used,\r\nsuch a plan should not affect the life of the battery. Care should be\r\nused also, in this regard, not to discharge the battery too low to\r\nprevent its utilizing its function of starting the car when it was\r\ndesired to use the car. However, if the battery were discharged below\r\nits starting capacity, by any peradventure, the car could be started\r\nby the old-fashioned cranking method.\r\n\r\nUsing an automobile lighting system for house lighting implies that\r\nthe car be stored in a garage near the house or barn; as this battery\r\nis too low in voltage to permit transmitting the current any distance.\r\nOne hundred feet, with liberal sized transmission wires is probably\r\nthe limit.\r\n\r\nThat such a system is feasible is amply proved by an occurrence\r\nrecently reported in the daily papers. A doctor summoned to a remote\r\nfarm house found that an immediate operation was necessary to save the\r\npatient's life. There was no light available, except a small kerosene\r\nlamp which was worse than nothing. The surgeon took a headlight off\r\nhis car, strung a pair of wires through a window, and instantly had at\r\nhis command a light of the necessary intensity.\r\n\r\nAnother manner in which an automobile engine may be used for house\r\nlighting is to let it serve as the charging power of a separate\r\nstorage battery. The engine can be belted to the generator, in such a\r\ncase, by means of the fly wheel. Or a form of friction drive can be\r\ndevised, by means of which the rear wheels (jacked up off the floor)\r\nmay supply the necessary motive power. In such a case it would be\r\nnecessary to make allowance for the differential in the rear axle, so\r\nthat the power developed by the engine would be delivered to the\r\nfriction drive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following pages contain advertisements of Macmillan books by the\r\nsame author or on related subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER POWER ENGINEERS\r\n\r\nDESIGNERS AND MANUFACTURERS\r\n\r\nHUNT SUPERIOR QUALITY\r\n\r\nComplete equipments for developing water powers including:--Water\r\nWheels, Flumes, Governors, Supply Pipes, Gates, Hoists, Valves,\r\nScreens, Gears, Pulleys, Clutches, Bearings, Shafting, etc.\r\n\r\nThree types of water power developing wheels, ranged to meet every\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n     Div.

H. BAILEY\r\n\r\n_Four Volumes. Each, cloth, 12mo. Uniform binding, attractively boxed.\r\n$5.00 per set; carriage extra. Each volume also sold separately._\r\n\r\nIn this set are included three of Professor Bailey's most popular\r\nbooks as well as a hitherto unpublished one,--\"The Country-Life\r\nMovement.\" The long and persistent demand for a uniform edition of\r\nthese little classics is answered with the publication of this\r\nattractive series.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY LIFE MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n_Cloth, 12mo, 220 pages, $1.25 postage extra_\r\n\r\nThis hitherto unpublished volume deals with the present movement for\r\nthe redirection of rural civilization, discussing the real\r\ncountry-life problem as distinguished from the city problem, known as\r\nthe back-to-the-land movement.\r\n\r\nTHE OUTLOOK TO NATURE (New and Revised Edition)\r\n\r\n_Cloth, 12mo, 195 pages, $1.25 postage extra_\r\n\r\nIn this alive and bracing book, full of suggestions and encouragement,\r\nProfessor Bailey argues the importance of contact with nature, a\r\nsympathetic attitude toward which \"means greater efficiency,\r\nhopefulness, and repose.\"\r\n\r\nTHE STATE AND THE FARMER (New Edition)\r\n\r\n_Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 postage extra_\r\n\r\nIt is the relation of the farmer to the government that Professor\r\nBailey here discusses in its varying aspects. He deals specifically\r\nwith the change in agricultural methods, in the shifting of the\r\ngeographical centers of farming in the United States, and in the\r\ngrowth of agricultural institutions.\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE STUDY IDEA (New Edition)\r\n\r\n_Cloth, 12mo, $1.25 postage extra_\r\n\r\n\"It would be well,\" the critic of _The Tribune Farmer_ once wrote, \"if\r\n'The Nature Study Idea' were in the hands of every person who favors\r\nnature study in the public schools, of every one who is opposed to it,\r\nand most important, of every one who teaches it or thinks he does.\" It\r\nhas been Professor Bailey's purpose to interpret the new school\r\nmovement to put the young into relation and sympathy with nature,--a\r\npurpose which he has admirably accomplished.\r\n\r\n  THE MACMILLAN COMPANY\r\n  PUBLISHERS\r\n  64-66 Fifth Avenue\r\n  NEW YORK\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\nThe square root symbol is indicated by sqrt(..)\r\n\r\nExponents are indicated by ^\r\n\r\nBold in a table is indicated by =..=",
