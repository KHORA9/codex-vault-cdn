PHILADELPHIA, _Third Month, 1820._  _No. 3._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE DESULTORY REMARKER.\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n                          Virtue is a good,\r\n    No foe can spoil, and lasting to the grave.\r\n                                        _Glover_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo that branch of the harmonious family of Literature, of which the\r\nESSAYIST is a legitimate member, one peculiar immunity has uniformly\r\nbeen accorded. He has permission, at all times, to commune with his\r\nreaders, unrestrained by drawing-room etiquette, and without being\r\nrequired to appear in full dress. He can, in this respect, plead\r\nimmemorial usage, or literary common law, as a privileged personage.\r\nBut, as neatness of costume and decorous deportment are never\r\ndisregarded, by the well-bred man, in any circumstances; so, the\r\nwell-bred writer will not fail in his observance of neatness of style,\r\nand, what is of infinitely more importance, correctness of sentiment.\r\nFamiliarity, inordinately indulged, is another name for rudeness.\r\nMotives of the most imperious character, calculated to prompt him to\r\nsuch a course of conduct, may be found, in contemplating the splendid\r\nunion of talent and virtue, by which many of those were distinguished,\r\nwho have trodden the same path before him. They were, alternately\r\nengaged, in culling, from its borders, flowers variegated with every\r\ntint of beauty, or in gathering the ripest, most salutary, and most\r\ndelightful fruit. Although, on the authority of Bacon and Roscommon,\r\nthe author of the \"English Dictionary\" has defined an ESSAY to be \"_an\r\nirregular, indigested piece_,\" yet there are other eminent scholars,\r\nwho, it would appear, did not consider such a definition as perfectly\r\ncorrect. JOHN LOCKE, one of the greatest men, of whom Great Britain can\r\nboast, and the late Dr. SMITH, of Princeton, have imparted a degree\r\nof dignity to the term, not in exact accordance with the generally\r\nreceived acceptation of its import. These may, however, be viewed in\r\nthe light of exceptions to a general rule. While furnished with the\r\nopportunity, permit me to dwell for a moment, with some emphasis, on\r\nthe meritorious ESSAYS of these celebrated writers. The philosophy of\r\nLOCKE has no affinity, whatever, with the infidel philosophy of more\r\nrecent times. He was a firm believer in the sublime, and inexpressibly\r\nimportant, truths of Revelation; and consequently, a serious and devout\r\nChristian. His analysis of mind, and the index he has given by which\r\nto ascertain where its strength may be profitably exerted, and where\r\nthe depths of profundity present themselves, which its limited line\r\ncannot fathom, are calculated to teach its true nature and powers. The\r\nperusal of such a work, will necessarily widen the mental horizon of\r\nevery intelligent reader, and, at the same time, impart a taste for\r\nthat practical mode of inquiry which is characterized by closeness\r\nof research. He advances step by step in his investigations; you are\r\nnever solicited to adopt his conclusions, but they are made manifest,\r\nin the broad and clear light of truth. Dr. SMITH, a countryman of our\r\nown, was a man of profound learning, possessing a genius of the highest\r\norder. One reason, for entertaining a high opinion of his ESSAY on the\r\ncauses of the difference of complexion, &c. in the human species, shall\r\nbe stated. We all have our prejudices; some of which, viewed through\r\nthe deceptive medium of education and habit, are probably concealed\r\nfrom ourselves.--Amongst these prejudices, there are none, perhaps,\r\nstronger or more inveterate, even in Pennsylvania, than those which\r\nexist against the unfortunate and injured African. Oh, my country! thou\r\nart madly provoking the tremendous indignation of Heaven, by a perilous\r\nperseverance in wrong and injustice!\r\n\r\n    And hast thou then no law besides thy will,\r\n    No just criterion fix'd to good and ill?\r\n\r\nFuturity is wisely concealed from our view; but of this solemn truth\r\nthere can be no question,--VICE and OPPRESSION _will not always\r\ngo unpunished_. Almost unconscious of it, the unjust bias, above\r\nalluded to, had in some degree taken possession of my mind; but was,\r\nit is hoped, almost entirely removed, by an attentive and thorough\r\nexamination of his doctrines. He, as well as LOCKE, contemplates true\r\nphilosophy in the elevated character of a hand-maid to Revelation. One\r\nof his leading objects is, to establish, by a course of fair and manly\r\nreasoning, the veracity of the Mosaic account of the creation.\r\n\r\nWhen I sat down at my desk, I had intended to consult a few of the\r\npages of our early history, for the purpose of finding some profitable\r\nlessons for the instruction of the present generation; but, by\r\nindulging a _desultory_ propensity, the original purpose has almost\r\nbeen lost sight of. The salutary effect, which results from frequently\r\nascending to first principles, has been long known and acknowledged.\r\nThere is many a prodigal spendthrift among us, who would do well,\r\nin various respects, to imitate the example of his industrious and\r\nunostentatious ancestor, from whom he has inherited the means of\r\nindulging his extravagant desires. He should remember, that the highest\r\nprivilege of wealth is to aid the meritorious who stand in need of\r\nassistance; and that industry, properly directed, does, even to the man\r\nwhose necessities do not require such exertion, always bring with it an\r\nample reward. \"Health and length of days are in her right hand, and in\r\nher left riches and honour!\"\r\n\r\nThe corner stone of this Commonwealth was laid in immutable justice;\r\nand the hands of her founders were never stained by the blood of an\r\nIndian. Our primitive annals, therefore, solicit, and will endure,\r\nthe closest and most rigid scrutiny. The first settlers were plain in\r\ntheir habits, and simple in their manners. They laboured indefatigably\r\nwith their own hands, and their lives were distinguished by pure\r\nmorals, and unaffected piety. The blessing of Providence followed\r\nthem; and their descendants have become a great people. But how long\r\nwill this prosperity last, should their maxims of economy, simplicity,\r\nand temperance, continue to be utterly disregarded? Necessity, it is\r\nbelieved, is at the present time, teaching some of them with effect.\r\nWILLIAM PENN, whose amiable and great qualities furnish an opulent\r\nsubject, on which, if the narrowness of my page did not forbid, I\r\nshould delight to dwell, was one of those bright luminaries which, at\r\ndistant intervals, have cheered and irradiated a benighted world.\r\n\r\n    Thus lovely halcyons dive into the main,\r\n    Then show far off their shining plumes again.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to relate an anecdote of the great lawgiver,\r\nwhich is traditional, it is true, but, at the same time, direct and\r\nauthentic. Being on a visit at the house of one of his friends, who\r\nresided at GWYNEDD, a Welch settlement, twenty miles from Philadelphia,\r\nhe remained there during the night. When shown into his chamber, in\r\nwhich there was a considerable quantity of grain, apologies were made\r\nto him, and regrets expressed, that no better accommodations could be\r\nfurnished, on such an occasion. With that urbanity and goodness of\r\nheart, for which he was so remarkable, he immediately put to rest every\r\nanxiety, which had previously existed, by a single observation: \"_I do\r\nnot wish to see more appropriate furniture in a new settlement; nothing\r\ncould give me more pleasure._\" It should not be forgotten, that PENN\r\ncould number among his _intimate_ friends, many of the English nobility\r\nand gentry; and had stood, with no infrequency, in the presence of\r\nprinces, but still his humility and unassuming manners were unimpaired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n                   How little can be known!\r\n    This is the wise man's sigh;--how far we err!\r\n    This is the good man's not unfrequent pang!\r\n                                _Wordsworth_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no faculty of the mind, of which man is more proud, than of\r\nREASON. It is this which most strikingly distinguishes him from the\r\nbrute creation, to which he owes his empire over the elements, and by\r\nwhich he dares ever to explore the councils of the Deity. The triumphs\r\nof reason, however, have chiefly been in the fields of philosophy, and\r\namidst the stillness of solitude, \"in regions mild of calm and serene\r\nair.\" In the ordinary pursuits of life, her voice is drowned amidst\r\nthe clamour of contending passions; and every successive generation\r\nof mankind, has to travel over the same course of inexperience and\r\npresumption, of error and misconduct, of remorse and repentance. The\r\ntriumphs of reason in philosophy endure from age to age, and are not\r\nonly glorious in themselves, but the means of acquiring new conquests.\r\nThose victories, which she obtains over the passions, are confined\r\nto the lives, and written in the experience, of individuals. The\r\ntruths, which it required the utmost capacity of the human intellect\r\nto develope, are now familiar to the apprehension of every school-boy:\r\nbut human nature continues to be as prone to evil, as selfish and\r\nuntoward, as if the divine Author of our religion had never walked on\r\nearth. There is, in this view of the subject, much that may humble the\r\nmost aspiring intellect. It shows, that the greatest genius affords no\r\nexemption from the ordinary weaknesses and vices of our nature, and\r\nthat the mere force of reason cannot destroy the propensities which for\r\never drag us down to earth.\r\n\r\nEven in those pursuits which are purely abstract, the different\r\ndegrees of intellect approximate more nearly to each other than we\r\ncommonly imagine. There are certain brilliant talents which we are apt\r\nto regard with a kind of superstitious feeling, and which we suppose\r\nto be gifted with an almost intuitive knowledge. Yet, the truth is,\r\nthat those qualities which most easily attract the vulgar gaze, are\r\nfallacious and superficial. The highest and most lasting rewards of\r\nfame, have been earned by slow and patient labour; while the more\r\ndazzling career of genius has often terminated in disappointment\r\nand obscurity. He who trusts to the mere force and splendour of his\r\ntalents, will find that they cannot sustain his flight, and that the\r\nmost brilliant inventions of the human mind fade before the realities\r\nof nature; that there is no real glory in philosophy, separate from\r\nthat of truth, and no key which will unlock her treasures, save that\r\nof patient investigation. There can be no discipline, better fitted\r\nto humble the pride and silence the vanity of man, than that of the\r\ninductive philosophy; for it teaches him that the only disposition\r\nof mind, in which he can acquire substantial knowledge, is that of\r\ndocility to the voice of experience; and that patience and humility are\r\nfar more valuable and efficient in a philosopher, than the brightest\r\ngenius. When Newton commenced the researches that conducted him to an\r\neminence, which no other mortal has attained, it was by careful and\r\nunprejudiced observation. He suffered no previous opinion to mislead\r\nhis judgment, no weak ambition to disturb his mind; but watched, with\r\nuntiring patience, for the illuminations of truth. It was, probably, to\r\nthis careful exclusion of prejudice and vanity, as much as to any other\r\ncause, that he owed his wonderful achievements; for they must have been\r\nattained by regular advances, by steps which the meanest understanding\r\nis capable of following.\r\n\r\nIf these remarks are correct as regards philosophical, they are more\r\nstrikingly so in relation to moral truth. The fabric of philosophy\r\nis the work of ages, and its dimensions are as capacious as those of\r\nnature; but the edifice of moral truth can be perfected in the sphere\r\nof action, and during the life of every individual. Its foundation\r\nis laid by the hand of the Creator in the heart of every intelligent\r\nbeing, and is spoken of in Scripture, as the rock on which the wise\r\nman built, and under the type of a light which has enlightened every\r\nman, of a word which is nigh us in our heart and in our mouth. This\r\nlight may be darkened by superstition, distorted by prejudice, or\r\nburied beneath the cumbrous systems of a false philosophy; but can\r\nnever be totally extinguished. He who would follow its illuminations,\r\nand become the votary of truth, must separate himself from these\r\ntroubled elements of life. He must listen in quiet seclusion to\r\nher voice, and acquire, by humble and patient watchfulness, that\r\nhabitual mastery over his mind, which is the groundwork, and the only\r\nfoundation, of permanent excellence; and thus will he gradually come to\r\nknow the truth as it is.\r\n\r\nHe who thinks to hear her still and small voice amidst the agitations\r\nof contending passions, will find himself deaf to its monitions.\r\nIn our intercourse with the world, and our chase of its glittering\r\nphantoms, our interests and desires continually mislead us. We follow\r\ntheir guidance, rather than that of truth; we hurry down the stream\r\nof pleasure and business, and make our reason itself the slave of\r\nour appetites. There is something in the alternations of hope and\r\nfear, in the longings of ambition, and the first flushes of success,\r\nthat engrosses and fills the mind. But when the zeal, with which we\r\nfollowed some object of unworthy ambition, is spent; when the violence\r\nof passion is exhausted, and satiety has succeeded to enjoyment, we\r\nsink down into the bitterness of self-reproach and remorse. We then\r\nperceive how fatally we have wandered from the path of reason, and\r\ndetermine, while our passions are spent and asleep, to chain them at\r\nher feet. Alas! they will awake, like the tiger from his lair, with the\r\nscent of blood in his nostrils, more furious and more powerful from\r\nevery success.\r\n\r\nThese loose and general remarks may serve to illustrate the admirable\r\neconomy of Providence. The truths, which it is important for us to\r\nknow, are easily comprehended. Those qualities, by the possession of\r\nwhich the great end of our being is to be answered, are within the\r\nattainment of every rational creature. By a wonderful law of equality,\r\nthe difference which appears to exist between different orders of\r\nintellect, is scarcely sensible in its effects upon the happiness and\r\nvirtue of individuals. Brilliant talents, and rare accomplishments,\r\ndo but expose their owner to more dangerous and subtle temptations,\r\nand too often furnish the weapon which destroys the peace of their\r\npossessor; while humbler virtues pass along, unconscious of these\r\nself-inflicted tortures. The latter pursue, from instinct and choice,\r\nthat path of humble and quiet action, which the former will find, after\r\nall his wanderings, to be the only one that leads to peace, and is\r\nlighted by the pure and unwavering radiance of truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nSEEDS.\r\n\r\nFrom the Plough-Boy's Cottage.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis morning, as I awoke from my slumbers, these words came before me,\r\n\"_Take care what you sow!_\" The reflections they have awakened, amidst\r\nthe wonderings such a salutation of the morning beam has excited; may\r\nnot prove idle or merely speculative.\r\n\r\nThe husbandman, when he commits his seed to the earth, conscious of\r\nhaving done all within his power, rests in the goodness of HIM who\r\nrules these lower elements, for the completion of the work. The white\r\nmantle of Nature is thrown over the germs of future sustenance, by the\r\ngenial breath of Spring; \"the early and the latter rains,\" and the\r\nvivifying heat of the sun, awaken those germs into beauty, clothe them\r\nwith luxuriance, and ripen them for the sickle. But the husbandman well\r\nknows, that unless he be careful to select seed of the proper kind, and\r\nweight and purity, the product, he will reap, will deteriorate in its\r\nnature. However good the soil may be, his granary will receive a value\r\nproportioned only to his attention to the maxim--_Take care what you\r\nsow._\r\n\r\nBut there are SEEDS, whose value is infinitely greater than wheat, or\r\nrye, or barley. Give me your ears, ye honest hearts of our rich farms,\r\nye independent men of our beautiful vallies, and let me caution you to\r\n_take care how you sow_!\r\n\r\nIt is recorded, with great truth, that \"books, men and things are lying\r\nconstantly in wait to deceive souls, and bring them to perdition:\" and\r\nbooks are here very correctly placed first on the list of deceivers.\r\nThey are more dangerous, because less suspected; and the _seeds_,\r\nwhich are sown, by pernicious volumes, in the minds of the young and\r\ninexperienced, in the silence of solitude, take very deep root, and\r\nbring forth fruits of vice and corruption. O! how the spirit of genuine\r\nsensibility laments the widely spreading evils, which cast desolation\r\nover _fields of beauty!_ Beware! ye noble-minded yeomen, how you admit\r\ninto your little libraries, these insidious seducers, these _tares_,\r\nwhich grow amidst the tender plants which the LORD of the heritage has\r\ndeposited in the soil he loves, and committed to your charge. It is\r\nin your power to aid the growth of the germs of goodness and piety,\r\nwhich may flourish under your fostering care, by the blessing of the\r\ngreat Husbandman, and make your children the glory of our country!\r\nAim, therefore, at a judicious selection, that the _seeds_ you sow may\r\nnot want either weight or purity; and then \"the early and the latter\r\nrain,\" which descend _from above_, will mature them into strength and\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\nThis caution is also peculiarly applicable to those who have the\r\ndirection of the numerous village libraries, that have latterly arisen\r\nin our favoured land. On these men, an awful responsibility rests.\r\nThey have, in their hands, the future characters of the people, who\r\nmay live in their respective neighbourhoods. They have, under their\r\ncare, _the destinies of an unborn race_! The _seeds_, which are\r\nnow sown in the hearts of the young, will, when they shall become\r\nparents, be transmitted to other soils. What an incalculable magnitude\r\nand importance invest this subject! Let them beware, therefore,\r\nas they shall answer at a high tribunal. \"Take care,\"--said a\r\nmonitor to the celebrated statuary, BACON, as he tapped him on the\r\nshoulder,--\"remember, you are working for posterity!\"--and the caution\r\nwas reciprocated to the divine. _Take care_, says the Plough-Boy, to\r\nthe directors of village libraries, _what you sow_!\r\n\r\nMany a lovely damsel, whose rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes once\r\nindicated the sweetness and the purity of innocence, has had her heart\r\ntarnished, corrupted, ruined, by the insidious poison of books,--books\r\nread in secret, remote from the vigilant eye of a tender parent or kind\r\nfriend. Into the recesses of the solitude of these; yes, even at the\r\nhour when the remainder of the family is reposing in peace, and when\r\nthe rays of the midnight lamp are thrown on the idle, the romantic, or\r\nvicious page, let the warning voice of the Plough-Boy enter. May his\r\naccents thunder in their ears, _Take care how you sow_!\r\n\r\nThe vast increase of _taverns_, in our country and villages, calls\r\nus to beware of _men_, as well as of books. There is a great\r\ndifference, my father tells me, between the simplicity of manners,\r\nwhich characterized the times when he was a boy, and the idleness\r\nand dissipation which have now spread over the country. Then it was\r\nconsidered a _disgrace_, to a young farmer, to be seen at a tavern,\r\nexcepting when absolute necessity called him thither. Now, visit one\r\nof these seductive inns, in an afternoon, and we can see a band of\r\nhardy striplings, smoking their segars, drinking their cans of beer,\r\nor tossing off their glasses of \"real Holland,\" and permitting their\r\nminds to be agitated by the evanescent politics of the day, while\r\ntheir families are either ignorant of their habits, or mourning over\r\nthe tares, which the enemy is sowing in a fruitful field. Alas! even\r\nin his time, the Plough-Boy has witnessed the robust young husbandman,\r\ngraced with an athletic form, adorned with vivid health and manly\r\nbeauty, and blessed with a lovely wife and innocent prattlers, sink\r\ninto an early grave, opened by Infamy and closed by Despair, solely in\r\nconsequence,--first, of suffering his mind to be led aside from his\r\nbusiness by the solicitations of idle men, and losing his precious time\r\nat the tavern; and then, of \"just taking a social glass,\" which they\r\nhave told him it would be unmanly to refuse.\r\n\r\nBeware, my youthful companions, of these _first_, and apparently\r\ninsignificant steps in idleness. No man suddenly becomes wicked. The\r\npower of habit is enlisted on the side of virtue, until its barrier be\r\nbroken down by repeated _small_ attacks; and he, who in former times\r\ncould indignantly exclaim, \"Is thy servant a _dog_, that he would do\r\nthis thing?\" yet committed the very evils at which an exalted spirit\r\nhad shuddered with terror. _Take care_, ye young noblemen of Nature!\r\n_how you sow_.\r\n\r\nVarious other incitements are widely spread through our country,\r\nto lead men to sow seeds of vice and ignominy in their fields. It\r\nbecomes not the Plough-Boy to enter too much into detail. The evils\r\nare abroad, and walking their desolating course; and he who can, in\r\nthe hour of solitude, yield his mind to the dominion of reflection,\r\nwill be at no loss to discover the peculiar inducements to idleness or\r\ndissoluteness, in his own vicinity. To all, therefore, who value the\r\n_seeds of immortal beauty_, let the warning voice of the Plough-Boy of\r\nthe valley, reach with effect; and the gentle salutation of the morning\r\nray, which visited his own spirit, may not have been sent without an\r\ninstructive purpose. To all, this lesson is deeply interesting; for\r\nthe happiness of the long, long ages of eternity, depends upon it.\r\n\"Whatsoever a man shall sow, that will he reap. If ye sow to the flesh,\r\nye shall reap corruption; but if to the spirit, the life which is\r\neternal.\"\r\n\r\n  _Downington, January 29, 1820._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\"IS IT PEACE, JEHU?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evanescent sorrows of infancy have faded from the recollection, the\r\nflowery scenes of childhood are passed, the thraldom of pupilage is\r\nover, the fetters of minority are dissevered, and Youth steps boldly on\r\nthe threshold of life, proud of the superiority, and conscious of the\r\nattributes of MAN.\r\n\r\n    \"The world is all before him where to choose.\"\r\n\r\nSociety courts him to the enjoyment of rational and of sensual\r\npleasure. The anticipation of evil finds no place in his imagination.\r\nAll of friendship is faithful, and love pure as attractive. A short\r\ncareer in the busy round of existence, while it proves the fallacy\r\nof some of his crude conceptions, only affords a confirmation of\r\nothers. If trusted friendship discover its instability, or cherished\r\nlove its inconstancy, still Fancy promises, in other fountains, the\r\nunadulterated source of happiness. He looks not to the mind to supply\r\nthe vacuum they have left. Youth is not the season for reflection. Fame\r\nhas not yet animated the daring spirit of enterprise, and the social\r\ncircle and the midnight revel display all their attractions. Lost in\r\nthe whirl of inebriating delights, Reason maintains but a divided\r\nempire. But let her \"still small voice\" be heard in the intervals of\r\npassion, and will it not whisper to his heart, _Is it peace?_\r\n\r\nThe bowl has ceased to exhilarate; this species of excitement is\r\nhappily relinquished, and, in the active scenes of business, he finds\r\na stimulant to exertion and enjoyment. The acquisition of wealth will\r\nenable him to astonish the world with his magnificence; or, if a more\r\nworthy motive prevail, will furnish the means to relieve indigence,\r\nextricate virtuous misfortune from the fetters that chain it to the\r\nearth, and wipe the tear of want from the eye of the widow and the\r\norphan. Glorious reward for days of toilsome industry. How soon may\r\nhe find some more sordid spirit grasping the object that eludes his\r\npursuit, and the anguish of disappointment displace the glowing visions\r\nof his fancy. While the strife of hopes and fears drive repose from his\r\npillow, when the howling of the wind reminds him of the instability of\r\nthat element on which he has adventured many a _rich argosie_, it would\r\nbe mockery for him to ask of Care, _Is it peace?_\r\n\r\nFortune, however, while she laughed to scorn his dreams of princely\r\nsplendour, has deigned to crown his days of anxiety with competence,\r\nand Philosophy bids him be content. He chooses a partner of his joys\r\nand sorrows, and sees a hopeful progeny around him. Once more Fancy\r\nspreads the glowing landscape of the future to his eye. Through those\r\ndear ones, whose infantine pleasures now amuse his paternal mind, he\r\nwill attain the object of his hopes. His daughters shall wed with the\r\nfirst families that now tower above him; his sons--\r\n\r\n\"Visions of glory spare his aking sight;\"--\r\n\r\nhe eagerly anticipates the moment of their matured existence, when he\r\nshall exultingly exclaim, in the fulness of his heart, after the detail\r\nof their unrivalled achievements, I AM THEIR FATHER. A few years roll\r\naway; the fiat of Omniscience is gone forth, and all, but one, of those\r\nthat but now cheered his domestic board, are gathered into the garner\r\nof eternity. That one, the first--the last--remains his only comfort.\r\nOn that loved one, he, and the beloved partner of his afflictions,\r\nbowed down with sorrow rather than with years, now place their only\r\nhopes. He will support their tottering footsteps; he sooth the sorrows\r\nand smooth the pillow of their waning age. Alas! the haunts of\r\ndissipation receive him; premature infirmities, racking pains, palsied\r\nlimbs, hasten him, with rapid and unerring steps, to the grave--and all\r\nbeyond it. It were in vain to ask of his agonized bosom,--agonized by\r\nthe conviction of his fatal paternal indulgence,--_Is it peace!_\r\n\r\nIs not the quiver of affliction exhausted? One shaft is left. That\r\ndear mourner, that has partaken so largely of the cup of his sorrows,\r\ncannot sustain the recollection\r\n\r\n\"That such things were, and were most dear to her.\"\r\n\r\nSilent and uncomplaining, she bows before the storm. Her ashes rest\r\nwith those of her children. Where is now that eager spirit, grasping at\r\nphantoms, and soaring into the regions of uncreated imagination. Hope\r\nis extinguished in his bosom; his soul is black with the very midnight\r\nof despair. Frail man! Didst thou ever ask, _Of whom did I receive\r\nthese precious gifts?_ Bow before the throne of Omnipotence; bless that\r\nPower who gave and who took away; pray to him for resignation; and,\r\nwhen the spirit of vital religion pours its holy influence into thy\r\nheart, thou needest not ask of thyself or the world, _Is it peace?_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n_Letters of a Citizen to his Friends in the Country._\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\nIf the form of government with which we are blessed, is to be durable,\r\nit will depend upon the _virtue and intelligence of the people_.\r\nIgnorance and vice cannot sustain a republican system. It becomes,\r\ntherefore, a duty of the highest order, to spread practical learning\r\nover every mind, and cultivate piety in every heart. To do this, the\r\nestablishment of good schools, on the plan suggested in my last letter,\r\nis of great importance. But other means are also to be employed.\r\nParents, guardians, and masters, should discharge their duty toward\r\nthose who are entrusted to their care, by judicious advice and good\r\nexample, for the conduct of life. The domestic circle ought to be\r\nregarded as a _moral garden_, under the especial care of the head\r\nof every family. Here he may plant good seed, and this he is bound\r\nto protect from all pernicious weeds. Let him therefore frequently\r\nexamine the premises; he cannot be too assiduous, and vigilant. In\r\nthis particular department, more is to be accomplished, than many are\r\ndisposed to admit. And if ever our condition as a people is improved,\r\nin the degree to which it is susceptible, it will owe much to judicious\r\n_family discipline_. In the city, as well as in the country, we have\r\nbeen too relax in the performance of these manifest obligations.\r\nPrivate happiness and the public welfare are intimately connected with\r\nthe minute government, and careful training, of the minds of youth.\r\n\r\nAmong other auxiliaries, I would take the liberty to recommend the\r\nestablishment of libraries, to be composed of useful books. These might\r\nbe located in the school-houses of each neighbourhood, and the teacher\r\nshould be appointed to the care of the establishment. In the country,\r\nit is customary to assemble but once, in the day assigned, for social\r\nworship; in the afternoon of that day, the library might be opened\r\nfor the delivery and reception of books. How much better would it be,\r\nto witness the people passing, in an orderly manner, to, and from\r\nthe library of the vicinage, than assembling at taverns, or employed\r\nin idle and pernicious sports, on the evening of a day, set apart by\r\nChristian professors, for the worship, which is publicly due _to the\r\nSovereign of the world_!\r\n\r\nYou may suppose, fellow citizens, that these suggestions are the\r\noffspring of a visionary brain; but the period is coming, with no tardy\r\nstep, when sound morals and undefiled religion will be found to be the\r\nbest estate. Men and governments prosper solely in proportion as they\r\nare regulated by principles which GOD approves. It is idle, in the last\r\ndegree, to expect prosperity from any other source. All history, sacred\r\nand civil, teaches but one lesson; VICE AND IGNORANCE CONDUCT NATIONS\r\nTO THE TOMB!\r\n\r\nThis epistle is shorter than I had designed it to be; various\r\navocations have claimed my attention. I have only to solicit your\r\nattention to the subjects submitted in it to your notice, and to assure\r\nyou of my good will.\r\n\r\n                                                                  CIVIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreatise on Agriculture.\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\nOf the actual state of Agriculture in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Holland_, though essentially commercial has, from causes rarely\r\noccurring, become also highly agricultural. To the descendants of\r\nDutchmen, the following description of her industry, in this respect,\r\ncannot but be acceptable. It is from the pen of an excellent judge and\r\nfaithful narrator.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] M. Yoarst, professor of agriculture at Elfort. See his introductory\r\naddress to his class, in 1806.\r\n\r\n\"Their rotation of crops, always begins with the culture either of some\r\nleguminous plant or profitable root, and generally with the potato, as\r\nthe best preparative of the ground. Whatever may be the grain which\r\nfollows, whether wheat, rye, &c. &c. it is generally sown with _red\r\nclover_; and where it is not, the stubble is ploughed in immediately\r\nafter harvest, and a crop of turnips taken and either consumed on\r\nthe ground or housed for the winter. A single department (that of\r\nZealand) obtains by the culture of madder alone, an annual profit\r\nof six millions of florins; while that of Brabant boasts its twenty\r\nthousand bee-hives; in a word, this commendable nation, upon an extent\r\nof surface not exceeding seventeen hundred square leagues, (the greater\r\npart of which has been redeemed from the ocean) counts two hundred and\r\nforty-three thousand horses, seven hundred and sixty thousand horn\r\ncattle, about a million of sheep, from ten to twelve thousand goats,\r\nfour hundred and eighty-nine thousand hogs, and about three millions of\r\npoultry, of every species. Their stock of manure is necessarily great,\r\nand is both well understood and well managed.\"\r\n\r\n9. The same causes, physical and moral, operate against the existence\r\nof a productive agriculture in _Denmark_ and _Sweden_--severity of\r\nclimate, poverty of soil, and vassalage of tenants.[2]--Their resources\r\nare also alike, and exist principally in manufactures and commerce, and\r\nin mines, forests and fisheries. The former boasts fine pasturage and\r\ncattle, in Holstein.\r\n\r\n[2] To give to despotism the air of freedom, the _serfs of the crown_\r\nwere liberated at the revolution--but the example was neither approved\r\nnor followed.\r\n\r\n10. Under the common name of Germany, we include Prussia, Saxony,\r\nAustria, Wurtemburg, and Bavaria, and shall say a few words of each,\r\ncalculated to give a general idea of their husbandry. It was not to be\r\nexpected that the great Frederick of _Prussia_ (so devoted to national\r\nglory and strength) would disregard the interest of agriculture;\r\nand the less so, as in theory he considered it \"_Les mamelles de\r\nl'elat_.\" We accordingly find him employed in draining marshes of\r\ngreat extent,[3] in filling them with industrious colonists, and in\r\nconverting barren sands into fertile fields, by placing his capital in\r\nthe midst of them. But amongst these good works, he forgot that the\r\n_hands of the labourer, to be efficient, must be free_; he found the\r\npeasants slaves, and left them such.\r\n\r\n[3] In the _Dollart_ what was lost by the sea was regained, and the\r\nmarshes on the _Netz_ and the _Warth_ at _Friedburg_ and in _Pomerania_\r\nwere drained, and the country rendered habitable.\r\n\r\nThe _Saxon_ peasant, on the other hand is _free_ and protected by the\r\nlaw; he holds his farm on lease, which he sells or transmits to his\r\nchildren at will: and _this_ is the principal cause of the flourishing\r\nstate of Saxon agriculture. In Lusatia, a different legislation\r\nproduces different effects; but for some years past, the government and\r\ngreat proprietors have concurred in changing the _vassalage_ of the\r\npeasants into a _mild_ and _salutary dependence_. Saxony is remarkable\r\nfor its grain products, and Lusatia for its stock--the latter counts\r\nfour hundred thousand head of sheep of the merino race.\r\n\r\nGeographers give to _Austria_ and her dependencies 1965 leagues in\r\ncircumference. In a surface like this, there is necessarily a great\r\nvariety, as well of climate as of soil; but in general, both are\r\nfavourable to agriculture. \"In the districts of the Inn, of Lower\r\nStira, of Istria, and of Carniola, the land is of good quality, well\r\ncultivated and very productive. In the last, they have two crops in\r\nthe year; sowing buck-wheat on wheat or rye stubble, and millet on\r\nthat of hemp and flax.--They every where cultivate Indian corn, and in\r\nStyria (as in Virginia) it forms the ordinary bread of the country.\"\r\nIn Bohemia, Moravia, and Galitia,[4] the soil is uncommonly rich, and\r\nunder proper management would be very productive. Austrian Silesia\r\nis less fitted for the production of grain, but excels in forage and\r\ncattle. Hungary, Transylvania and Croatia, abound in every species\r\nof agricultural produce. Their flocks and pasturage are not inferior\r\nto those of the Ukraine; and wheat, buck-wheat, Indian corn, millet,\r\nrice, hemp, flax and tobacco, yield immense harvests to very small\r\ndegrees of labour. Yet is agriculture far from being in a flourishing\r\ncondition!--Writers on political economy ascribe this fact principally\r\nto two causes--\r\n\r\n[4] Geographic Math.\r\n\r\n1st. The degradation and oppression of the labouring part of the\r\ncommunity; and\r\n\r\n2d. The want of convenient commercial outlets for the produce of the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWe shall find in Hungary a striking illustration of the correctness of\r\nthis opinion. \"The _Populus Hungaricus_,\" is divided into four estates,\r\nthe magnates, the nobles, and the clergy, who possess all the lands,\r\nand the \"_misera contribuens plebs_,\" who (besides tithes, rents and\r\ncorvees) pay all the taxes. This wretched populace is composed of the\r\nburghers and the peasantry, of which there are three kinds--_slaves for\r\nlife, temporary slaves_, and a third sort called _liberæ emigrationis_,\r\nwho, as their name indicates, have loco motive powers and rights.\r\nOf the condition of this people, since the year 1764, (and before\r\nthat period it was much worse) we may form an idea from the edict of\r\nMaria Theresa, called the _urbarium_, or law of contracts between\r\nlandlord and tenant, by which it is declared, that corporal punishment\r\n(inflicted by the master for insolent words or conduct) shall not\r\nexceed twenty-four strokes with a cane for a man, and the same number\r\nwith a switch for a woman. Nor is the _commercial_ condition of this\r\npeople better than the _civil_; they are not only obliged to take from\r\nAustria many things which they could have had in other places of a\r\nbetter quality and at a lower price, but they are also compelled to\r\ncarry to Vienna the products of their own soil and labour, where their\r\nsale is embarrassed and their value lessened by heavy and oppressive\r\ntaxes. The same remark applies to Galitia, whose natural outlet is the\r\nVistula, or the Nieper; but of these she is not permitted to avail\r\nherself, and, like her sister kingdoms, is compelled to seek the\r\nmarkets furnished by the Danube and Trieste. \"The consequences are\r\nobvious--the tenant works only to satisfy hunger, and the landlord is\r\nsatisfied with little more than '_victum et vestitum_.'\"[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Geog. Math. vol. 4. art. Hungary.\r\n\r\nThe amount of lands annually cultivated in _Bavaria_, is one million\r\none hundred and sixty-five thousand acres, which produce about six\r\nmillions of bushels of grain, of which two millions are surplus.\r\nThe Palatinate, (one of the dependencies of Bavaria) is also very\r\nproductive. The route between Heidelberg and D'Armstadt, called the\r\n_Bergstrass_, traverses one of the finest districts of Germany, and\r\nperhaps of Europe; where are seen extensive vineyards, vast meadows\r\nand fertile fields, producing wheat, barley, tobacco, madder, rhubarb,\r\nturnips, &c. &c. In the year 1799, all the electorial possessions\r\nwithin the circle of Bavaria, contained 199,000 horses, 160,000 oxen,\r\n465,000 cows, 961,000 sheep, 320,000 hogs, and 378,000 goats. Yet are\r\nthe Bavarians, compared with the inhabitants of the north of Germany,\r\nhalf a century in the rear. The people are, extremely ignorant and\r\nfantastical: like the people of Rome and Lisbon, they sacrifice\r\nmuch time to processions and fetes, and like them also are slaves of\r\nthe vilest appetites. Debauchery is no where more flagrant than in\r\nMunich.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] Geog. Math. &c. art. Bavaria. Compare the productiveness of Bavaria\r\nwith England--the comparison is in favour of the former.\r\n\r\n_Wurtemburg_ is ranked among the most fertile and well cultivated\r\ncountries of Germany. The mountainous parts produce potatoes, oats,\r\nhemp and flax; the less hilly abound in wheat, spelts, rye, buck-wheat,\r\nIndian corn and barley; and in the vallies we find tobacco, madder and\r\nvineyards, in which the grapes of France, Cyprus, and Persia succeed\r\nperfectly. Apples, pears, &c. are of common product and excellent\r\nquality.[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Idem.\r\n\r\n11. It has been justly remarked, that to know the state of husbandry in\r\nany country, you have but to examine the _instruments_ employed, the\r\n_succession_ of _crops_, and the _condition_ of _labourers_.--Tried\r\nby these tests, the agriculture of _Russia_ will be found to be in\r\na state of great degradation.--The plough (called _soka_) which\r\nis commonly used, is very light, of simple construction, and but\r\ncalculated to enter the ground _one inch and a half_; the _harrow_\r\nconsists of one or more young pine trees (whose branches are cut off\r\nabout eight inches from the stem) steeped in water to add to their\r\nweight, and tied together. With such miserable instruments, each drawn\r\nby a single horse, the farmer scratches the ground, and without always\r\ncovering the seed, which is no doubt the reason that in dry seasons\r\ntheir harvests are very bad.[8] In the best soil their _succession_ of\r\n_crops_ is of _eight years_--two in barley, two in oats, two in winter\r\nrye, and two in spring rye. Lands of less fertility are sown _two_\r\nyears out of _three_, and mountainous tracts one year in three, when\r\nthey are abandoned to weeds, until rest shall have reinstated them.\r\n\"To manure them would, in the opinion of a Russian peasant, make them\r\npoorer;[9] and therefore he suffers his dunghill to accumulate into\r\na nuisance, while he goes on to clear and exhaust new fields.\" \"The\r\ngrains raised are rye, spelts, barley, millet and oats, which, from\r\nwant of sufficient roads and markets, are often low priced; as are\r\nhorned cattle and horses: an ox selling for a ruble and a half, a cow\r\nfor one ruble, and a horse for three rubles.\"[10] To this wretchedness\r\nwe must add, (what perhaps occasions much of it) that throughout the\r\n_civilized_ part of Russia, the labours of agriculture are performed by\r\n_slaves_ confounded with the soil, and bought and sold with it. In a\r\ngreat portion of the northern section of this vast empire, agriculture\r\nis unknown; and the chase, the fisheries, cattle and rein-deer, furnish\r\nthe only means of subsistence.\r\n\r\n[8] Pallas, pages 3 and 4. vol. 1.\r\n\r\n[9] Pallas, vol. 5. page 60.\r\n\r\n[10] A ruble is equal to 5 livres, or 1 dollar Spanish.\r\n\r\n                           (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Nicholson's Prize Essay.\r\n\r\n_On a Rotation of Crops, and the most profitable mode of collecting,\r\npreserving and applying Manures._\r\n\r\n(Communicated to the Albany County Agricultural Society.)\r\n\r\n[CONCLUDED.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf manures which may be termed fossils we will mention the various\r\nkinds of calcareous substances, the stony matter called pyrites, coal,\r\nsalt, peaty substances, silicious and aluminous earths. Limestone,\r\ngypsum, chalk and marle, are the calcareous substances we shall notice,\r\nand each in their order.\r\n\r\nLimestone, (carbonate of lime,) has always more or less aluminous\r\nor silicious earth in its composition. Frequently also it contains\r\nmagnesia. Limestone of this latter description, when calcined, makes\r\nwhat the English farmers call _hot_ lime, which is more powerful in\r\nits effects, and therefore less of it should be applied at once to the\r\nsoil. That without any mixture of magnesia is considered more durable\r\nin its operation, but less powerful. Magnesian limestone is known by\r\nits effervescing but little when plunged in nitric or other acid, while\r\nlimestone that is not magnesian, when thus immersed produces a strong\r\neffervescence. The magnesian, also, when immersed in diluted nitric\r\nacid, or aqua fortis, renders the liquid of a milky appearance. It is\r\nusually of a brownish or pale yellow colour. Being more caustic when\r\ncalcined, than common limestone, it is more efficacious in decomposing\r\npeaty earths, and is best adapted for soils which have too much either\r\nof peaty or vegetable matter in them.----Where lands have been injured\r\nby too plentiful an application of this lime, peaty earth should be\r\napplied to them to correct the evil.\r\n\r\nThe trials of lime in this country have been quite limited, and\r\nconfined mostly to the middle states, particularly Pennsylvania. It\r\nhas usually been applied there at the rate of about forty bushels\r\nto the acre; but whether the lime used there is magnesian, we have\r\nnever understood. Lime may be applied as a top dressing or mixed with\r\nthe soil. Its application has been found most successful when the\r\nfirst succeeding crop was Indian corn; afterwards wheat is grown to\r\nadvantage. Instances are mentioned in the memoirs of the agricultural\r\nsociety of Philadelphia, where gypsum had no effect on worn out lands\r\ntill they were first manured with lime.\r\n\r\nBritish writers say that lime may be applied with equal advantage\r\neither when newly slaked or afterwards, that its effects are not\r\nalways the same particularly where soils are different, but that\r\nusually it is a very durable manure. A much larger quantity is,\r\nhowever, applied in Great Britain than has been usual here; but perhaps\r\nthe coolness of the summers there renders more requisite. We pretend\r\nto advise to no particular rules in the application of lime in this\r\ncountry, farther than that about forty bushels to the acre be first\r\ntried; but less for sandy soils, and perhaps more for those which are\r\nstiff clays would be advisable. In clays of this description, lime is\r\nparticularly useful in destroying the adhesive quality of such soils,\r\nand thereby rendering them a more friable loam. Such has been its\r\neffects on the clay lands which abound so much in England. Where the\r\nlime is magnesian, let trials be made of about twenty bushels to the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nThat country abounds much in the calcareous matter denominated chalk,\r\nwhich is also converted into lime by calcination, and used as a manure.\r\nIt forms a weaker sort of lime. As this substance, however, is hardly\r\nto be found in this country, it will be unnecessary further to speak of\r\nthis manure.\r\n\r\nGypsum, (sulphate of lime) is a most powerful stimulant to the growth\r\nof many crops in all dry soils in this country, but with the following\r\nexceptions: it has no sensible effect on lands newly cleared, on those\r\nin the vicinity of the ocean, nor on those which have been completely\r\nexhausted by severe cropping. In soils of this latter description, some\r\npabulous matter must be given them for the gypsum to digest or act\r\nupon; and this may be a previous manuring with lime, marl, bog-earth,\r\nbarn dung, or perhaps any substance that is calculated to improve the\r\ncondition of the soil. It should also be observed that the application\r\nof gypsum frequently fails entirely of producing its effects if\r\nfollowed by uncommon drought, or unusually wet weather. It is generally\r\nmost powerful when applied to growths of leguminous plants, to those\r\nextending in vines, such as the various species of the gourd tribe, the\r\nstrawberry, &c. and to several sorts of the green crops, particularly\r\npotatoes, clover-grasses, lucern, &c. On fibrous rooted grasses, and\r\nthose grain plants most nearly related to them, such as wheat, rye,\r\noats, barley, &c. it has no sensible effect when applied as a top\r\ndressing to the growing plants. On Buckwheat it is very powerful, and\r\nfor Indian corn it is also valuable. Judge Peters, (of Penn.) whose\r\nexperience of its uses has been long and extensive, says that although\r\nhe has found this manure of little use to many sorts of plants, when\r\napplied to them as a top dressing, yet he has invariably found that all\r\nplants derive benefit from their seeds being rolled in gypsum, after\r\nbeing soaked in some liquid, before sowing or planting. As a manure,\r\nhowever, for wheat or grain crops of similar kinds, immense benefit\r\nmay be derived from it by applying it to the sward, as a top dressing,\r\na suitable length of time before the ground is broken up. In this way\r\ntwo bushels of gypsum may be made to give an additional increase of\r\neight or ten bushels of wheat to the acre. Take, for instance, land\r\nwhich in its natural state, and with the usual culture, will only yield\r\nten bushels of wheat to the acre; in the fall or early in the spring,\r\ngive it a top dressing of two bushels of gypsum to the acre; by the\r\nmiddle of June following, the land will exhibit a fresh green sward,\r\nprincipally of white clover; and when land is thus clothed in verdure,\r\nit is a sure indication of a great addition to its fertility, and that\r\na good crop may then be expected. When, therefore, the green sward is\r\nthus formed, turn it under, and then, with the usual culture, twenty\r\nbushels of wheat to the acre may be expected, where only ten would\r\nhave been had without this previous enriching of the ground by the\r\napplication of gypsum. Yet the same quantity of this manure, applied as\r\na top dressing to the growing crop of wheat, would have had no sensible\r\neffect. It should therefore be understood, that for all growths which\r\nderive little or no benefit from gypsum, when applied as a top dressing\r\nto the growing plants, the ground should be previously enriched by\r\napplying this manure to the sward, a suitable length of time before it\r\nis to be broken up, which length of time will usually be from two to\r\nthree months. At all events as soon as the sward fully exhibits the\r\neffects of the gypsum it may then be turned under. Wherever a sward\r\nis to be turned under, this practice should be invariably pursued in\r\norder that the ground be rendered more fruitful for the crop that is to\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nIn this country gypsum is a great source of wealth, wherever soils are\r\nsensible to its effects. It has tended much to equalize the value of\r\nlands, by imparting an artificial fertility to those naturally more\r\nsterile, and that at a small expense.--But gypsum alone is by no means\r\na sufficient source of dependence as a manure for keeping lands in the\r\nimproved condition that is necessary for raising the best crops, and\r\nof course deriving the greatest profits. The farmer should attend also\r\nto making the most of such other manures as come conveniently within\r\nhis reach. We are, however, no advocate for obtaining manures at any\r\nprice; they may cost too much; but almost every farmer whose lands\r\nare of suitable quality, and who stocks them with as many cattle as\r\nhe can keep in good order, and then makes the best use of the manure\r\nthey afford, may usually, with this supply, and with the judicious\r\nuse of gypsum, added to good culture, keep his lands in an improving\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nBut some soils are so constituted as to be of diminished value without\r\na suitable mixture of other earths than those of which they are\r\ncomposed, and in such case are permanently benefited by such additions\r\nof earthy substances. If lands, for instance, are too sandy, or\r\ngravelly, the addition of clay to them, or what is better, of upland\r\nmarle, will permanently improve the soil; and where these earths can\r\nbe found within reasonable distance it will usually be labour well\r\nexpended in making such applications. We will state a case in point.\r\nIn the rear of the city of Albany lies an immense body of calcarious\r\nearth, which may properly be called a schistic marle. It is commonly\r\ncalled blue clay. This, when mixed with a due proportion of sand, forms\r\na very fertile and durable soil. Farther west of the city lie large\r\ntracts of sandy lands, which require suitable proportions of this marle\r\nto render them fit for good culture, and with such additions much of\r\nthem would be found very valuable. Where they lie sufficiently level,\r\nand are not too sandy, it will probably be found that from half a ton\r\nto a ton for every rod square would be sufficient to render them very\r\nfertile, and fitted for the most profitable rotations of crops.\r\n\r\nThis sort of marle, which may be found in various parts of the country,\r\nand very frequently under tracts of sandy lands, is a very valuable and\r\npermanent manure in all dry soils which are deficient of calcarious\r\nmatter, and have not already too great a proportion of clay in their\r\ncomposition. This manure should be laid on the land as a top dressing,\r\nin order that it may be completely pulverized before it is mixed with\r\nthe soil.\r\n\r\nUpland marle is sometimes found of silicious texture, in which case\r\nit is good for stiff soils, as well as for others. It is also found\r\nof different colours, when combined with argillaceous matter, and of\r\ndifferent qualities; that containing most lime or calcarious matter\r\nbeing always the best. Marles of this description are often very\r\nvaluable in forming a principal ingredient in composts, of which we\r\nshall presently speak, and the same may be observed of the superior\r\nsorts of this manure found in bog swamps, of which something shall now\r\nbe said.\r\n\r\nThis sort of marle is found, at greater or less depths, beneath the\r\nsurface of many bog swamps, and is of a whitish, a greyish, or a\r\nbrownish colour. The whitish is the most powerful, having most lime\r\nin its composition; the greyish is next in quality. The super stratum\r\nis either a bog earth, to wit, vegetable matter totally decomposed;\r\nor it is a peaty substance, or vegetable matter in a partial state of\r\ndecomposition. The bog earth is good manure of itself, and may be used\r\nseparately, or mixed with the marle; the peaty substance must undergo\r\na further decomposition before it is rendered valuable as a manure, it\r\nbeing then rendered similar to bog earth. These manures when applied\r\nto growing crops are somewhat similar in their effects to those of\r\ngypsum. They are valuable as top dressings, or for mixing with the\r\nsoil. Their effects are very powerful on Indian corn, and they are more\r\nor less valuable when applied to almost every sort of upland crop,\r\nwith the exception of wheat, rye, barley, &c. For these they are to be\r\napplied to the sward, a suitable time before breaking it up, as has\r\nbeen mentioned in regard to gypsum. It should, however, be observed,\r\nthat neither decomposed peat, nor bog earth, should be applied to soils\r\nwhich already contain too great a proportion of decomposed vegetable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nThe condition of clay soils is also permanently improved by mixing\r\na due proportion of sand in them. The most durable and perfect soil\r\nis chiefly composed of certain proportions of sand, clay, lime, and\r\nvegetable matter in a state of decomposition, and, whenever any soil\r\nis destitute of a due proportion of any of these, the addition of such\r\nearthy substance can never fail to serve as a manure.\r\n\r\nThe stony earth called Pyrites, when pulverised by the aid of a proper\r\ndegree of calcination, is much used; and highly esteemed in Flanders\r\nas a top dressing for grass lands, as is mentioned in a communication\r\nof the late Chancellor Livingston to the Society for the promotion of\r\nthe useful arts in this state. We will refer the reader to the 2d vol.\r\npublished by that Society for the manner of preparing this manure, and\r\nthe quantity to be used, &c.\r\n\r\nOf coal, we shall merely state that, from the results of experiments\r\nmade by the late Mr. Muhlenburg, (of Penn.) about 40 bushels to the\r\nacre of this substance, pulverised in the manner of gypsum, was found a\r\ngood manure, when applied as a top dressing.\r\n\r\nCommon salt, pulverised, and applied as a top dressing, at the rate of\r\nfrom two to four bushels to the acre, has, in many instances, powerful\r\neffects as a manure. Sea-water is peculiarly adapted for this purpose.\r\nMr. Deane, in his Farmer's Dictionary, mentions an instance where\r\na crop of potatoes, and another of flax, were greatly increased in\r\nproduct by an application of sea-water to them while growing. About a\r\npint of the water was applied to each hill of potatoes, and for the\r\nflax crop the water was sprinkled over the ground.\r\n\r\nSome trials have been made in this country of using burnt clay as a\r\nmanure, and its use is recommended, particularly for all dry arable\r\nlands, not inclining to clay. The first step in preparation for burning\r\nclay, is to have a considerable quantity of this earth dug up in spits,\r\nand laid to dry in the sun: when pretty well dried you prepare for\r\nburning by raising a little pile of dry wood in the shape of a pyramid,\r\nsay 4 or 5 feet high;--round this you build up the dried spits of clay,\r\nleaving a hole at the bottom, for the entrance of the air, and another\r\nat the top for it to pass off. Such, at least, was the method formerly\r\npractised in Great Britain, but the modern improvement of retaining the\r\nsmoke within the mass, agreeably to the plan spoken of by Mr. Cobbett,\r\nfor burning earth, ought also to be pursued in burning clay. After the\r\nfire has been set to the wood you continue digging up fresh clay and\r\npiling it around and over the heap, as fast as the fire penetrates\r\nthe mass, taking care, however, not to pile on so much at once as to\r\nextinguish the fire. If there be danger of its becoming extinguished,\r\nit may be advisable to make one or more holes in the sides of the\r\nheap by running a hole into it. The fresh earth is to be added during\r\npleasure or until a sufficient quantity is burned. After the heap has\r\ncooled it is fit for use, either by mixing with the soil as directed by\r\nMr. Cobbett, for applying burnt earth, of which we will next speak.\r\n\r\nBy a late improvement, earths, other than those of clay, are\r\nsuccessfully converted into good manure, by the process of burning. It\r\nis effected by retaining the smoke within the mass of earth while in a\r\nstate of ignition. Mr. Cobbett says he has tried this manure for the\r\nruta-baga crop, and found it as efficacious as barn dung. His manner\r\nof preparing it, and which we believe would also be the best method of\r\npreparing burnt clay, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I make a circle,\" says Mr. C. \"or an oblong square. I cut sods and\r\nbuild a wall all round three feet thick, and four feet high. I then\r\nlight a fire in the middle with straw, dry sticks, boughs, or such like\r\nmatter. I go on making this fire larger and larger, till it extend over\r\nthe whole bottom of the pit or kiln. I put on roots of trees or any\r\nrubbish wood, till there be a good thickness of strong coals. I then\r\nput on the _driest_ of the clods that I have ploughed up round about,\r\nso as to cover all the fire over. The earth thus put in will burn. You\r\nwill see the smoke coming out at little places here and there. Put\r\nmore clods wherever the smoke appears. Keep on thus for a day or two.\r\nBy this time a great mass of fire will be in the inside. And now you\r\nmay dig out the clay, or earth, any where round the kiln, and fling it\r\non without ceremony, always taking care to _keep in the smoke_; for,\r\nif you suffer that to continue coming out at any one place, a hole\r\nwill soon be made; the main force of the fire will draw to that hole;\r\na blaze like that of a volcano, will come out, and the fire will be\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\n\"A very good way is to put your finger into the top of the heap\r\nhere and there; and if you find the fire _very near_, throw on more\r\nearth.--Not _too much at a time_, for that weighs too heavily on the\r\nfire, and keeps it back; and, at _first_ will put it partially out. You\r\nkeep on thus augmenting the kiln, till you get to the top of the walls,\r\nand then you may, if you like, raise the walls and still go on. No rain\r\nwill affect the fire, when once it is become strong.\r\n\r\n\"The principle is to _keep out air_, whether at the top or the sides,\r\nand this you are sure to do, if you _keep in the smoke_. I burnt, this\r\nlast summer, about thirty wagon loads in one round kiln, and never saw\r\nthe smoke at all after the first four days. I put in my finger to try\r\nwhether the fire was near the top; and when I found it approaching, I\r\nput on more earth. Never was a kiln more completely burnt.\r\n\r\n\"Now, this may be done on the skirt of any wood where the matters are\r\nall at hand. This mode is far preferable to the _above ground_ burning\r\nin _heaps_. Because in the next place, the _smoke escapes there_,\r\nwhich is the finest part of the burnt matter. _Soot_, we know well, is\r\nmore powerful than ashes, and, soot is composed of the _grossest parts\r\nof the smoke_. That which flies out of the chimney is the best part of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"In case of a want of wood wherewith to begin the fire, the fire may be\r\nlighted precisely as in the case of _paring and burning_. If the kiln\r\nbe large, the oblong square is the best figure.--About _ten feet wide_,\r\nbecause then a man can fling the earth easily over every part. The mode\r\nthey pursue in England when there is no _wood_, is to make a sort of\r\nbuilding in the kiln with turfs and leave air holes at the corners of\r\nthe walls, till the fire be well begun. But this is tedious work; and\r\nis in this country wholly unnecessary. Care must, however, be taken,\r\nthat the fire be well lighted. The matter put in _at first_ should be\r\nsuch as is of the lightest description; so that a body of earth on fire\r\nmay be obtained, before it be too heavily loaded.\r\n\r\n\"The burning being completed, having got the quantity you want, let the\r\nkiln remain. The fire will continue to work, until all is ashes. If you\r\nwant _use_ the ashes sooner, open the kiln. They will be cold enough to\r\nremove in a week.\"\r\n\r\nA practice has long prevailed in Europe of paring and burning soils for\r\nthe purpose of improving their texture and increasing their fertility.\r\nOn clay lands, and such as contain too much vegetable matter, we\r\nconceive the process might be advisable if not too expensive. Its\r\neffect on clays is to destroy the adhesive quality of the soil, as the\r\nearth burned becomes rather of a silicious texture; and at the same\r\ntime the surface is much enriched by the operation. In the other case\r\nit is calculated to reduce the redundancy of vegetable matter, as well\r\nas to enrich the soil. The operation is performed in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\nWhen the ground is in a good sward of grass let it be carefully turned\r\nover with the plough, the irons of which should be well sharpened. Let\r\nthe plough run about three inches deep.--Then cross plough with a very\r\nsharp coulter, and the sward will all be cut into squares of about 10\r\nor 12 inches. You then proceed to set these square chunks up edgeways,\r\nby leaning two together, in which situation they will soon dry.--When\r\nwell dried build a part of them tip in the form of little ovens, and\r\nlet this be done at the distance of about every 18 feet each way. These\r\nare all to have a little opening or door, at a common windward side,\r\nfor the air to enter, and another opening above for the smoke to pass\r\noff. On some dry day when the wind is fair for blowing into the holes\r\nbelow place some straw or other dry rubbish into the holes and set fire\r\nto it. As soon as the fires have got fully going in each of the heaps,\r\nlet the holes in the tops be stopped up, for the purpose of retaining\r\nthe smoke, and keep gradually building up the heaps as the fire\r\npenetrates them, until all the chunks of earth are piled up round them;\r\nand when the heaps have fully burned and sufficiently cooled, they are\r\nto be evenly spread over the ground, and ploughed in.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Great Britain it has been the practice to burn peat\r\nearth, in a manner very similar to that before described for burning\r\nclay, and the ashes thus obtained from the mass were used for top\r\ndressings; but we believe this practice has mostly given way to that\r\nof rotting or decomposing peat in compost, the method of which is as\r\nfollows: you form the compost heap of about one half of peat, a fourth\r\nof lime, and a fourth of barn dung, and these substances are to be\r\nseparately laid along in a manner most convenient to be afterwards\r\nthrown into the compost heap in their proper proportions. You commence\r\nat one end with spreading a layer of peat on the ground, say, ten\r\nfeet square and four inches in depth; then a layer of lime on this\r\nand another of barn dung, each two inches thick; then another layer\r\nof peat, as before, and then the lime and barn dung, as before, until\r\nin this way the heap is raised about four feet high, and let the last\r\nlayer be of peat: then commence another ten feet square along side of\r\nthis, and raise it as before, till you raise it to the same height;\r\nthen with another ten feet square, at the end of this mass, and so on,\r\ntill the heap is completed. After the heap has stood a while, it will\r\nheat, and when the heat begins to subside, you commence again at one\r\nend of the heap and cut the whole down to the bottom, with the spade,\r\nand form a new heap, throwing the exterior parts of the heap, thus\r\ncut down, into the middle of the other. A second heating of the mass\r\nwill then commence, and when that subsides, the peat will be found\r\nsufficiently decomposed, and the whole an excellent mass of manure.\r\n\r\nIn this country peaty substances are usually to be found in morasses;\r\nas the superstratum of marle, as before-mentioned; as the principal\r\ningredient of the salt marshes contiguous to the ocean, and as the\r\nsuperstratum of tracts of cold lands which are covered with growths of\r\nevergreen trees.\r\n\r\nIn making composts with upland marle, before-mentioned, the proportions\r\nof the marle, with that of the lime and dung, may be similar to those\r\njust mentioned for the peat composts, or perhaps the marle may be in\r\ngreater proportion. The layers of each may be as before described, but\r\nthe heap only raised to such height that it may be cleft down to the\r\nbottom with the plough, then thrown together in a ridge again with this\r\nimplement; and let these operations be repeated, at intervals, till the\r\nwhole becomes well mixed, pulverised, and in a state of fermentation,\r\nwhen it is fit for use, and should be immediately applied to the soil\r\nin the manner before-mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe use of wood ashes as a manure, is well known. It is good for\r\nalmost all crops, and is to be used as a top dressing. It is much more\r\nefficacious as a manure in some parts of the country than others,\r\nparticularly on Long Island. It is most valuable on light dry soils,\r\nparticularly those which are sandy. Soot, as a top dressing, is much\r\nmore valuable than ashes, and is proper for almost all arable lands. It\r\nis most efficacious when well pulverised before its application.\r\n\r\nThe dung of fowls of every sort has much calcareous matter in it, and\r\nis very efficacious, applied as top dressings. Malt dust is good in the\r\nsame way--40 bushels of it is a proper allowance to the acre.\r\n\r\n_Night shade_ should be mixed with earth, say, two thirds of the latter\r\nto one of the former, and in the course of a few months it forms an\r\nexcellent manure. In most European cities this excrement is carefully\r\ncollected, for manure, while in this country its use has been neglected.\r\n\r\nMany liquids are furnished from every domicile, and particularly the\r\nkitchen, which, mixed with earths, and other substances, would form\r\nvaluable masses of manure. The liquids to which we principally refer,\r\nare the soap-suds, dish-water, brine of meat, urine, &c.; these should\r\nall be preserved, by being absorbed in rich earthy substances, together\r\nwith the contents of the hog-sty; and in this way a large heap of good\r\nmanure may be made that is commonly lost for want of attention in\r\nsaving these ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE RECORD.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Education._\r\n\r\n\r\nNo cause has more retarded the progress of education in the\r\nagricultural part of the community than a mistaken opinion, in regard\r\nto the use that can be made of it.--That the advantages of learning,\r\nin every state of society, should not be appreciated by the grossly\r\nignorant, is not to be wondered at; but that men well informed on many\r\nsubjects, should fall into the vulgar error of denying the advantages\r\narising from extensive knowledge is really surprising.\r\n\r\nWe hear it frequently observed by farmers, who have sons to educate,\r\nthat they intend such a one to follow his own occupation; and it will\r\nbe necessary that he should be taught to read, write, and cypher\r\nto the \"Rule of Three.\" Now it is believed with these _extensive_\r\nacquirements, a farmer will be able to keep his accounts tolerably\r\ndecent; to estimate the amount of any number of bushels of grain, at a\r\ngiven sum per bushel: but I shall forbear to mention all the advantages\r\nwhich this kind of knowledge may confer. The intelligent farmer well\r\nknows it has a boundary, and a very limited one too. To endeavour\r\nby force of reason to induce this class of farmers to abandon their\r\nerrors, would be time spent to little purpose; their minds are not\r\nrecipient for truths which lie beyond the narrow boundary of their\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nIt is to the enlightened and public spirited yeomanry of our\r\ncountry, that we are to look for a change in the education of our\r\nyouth.--Change, did I say? Rather an entire new system of education.\r\nI ask this class of farmers if they have any such a thing as an\r\nagricultural education among them. I mean an elementary, a systematic\r\none: we train our youth (at school) for the counting-house, and not\r\nfor the farm. We teach them the mysteries of the _cent per cent_; all\r\nthe dark intricacies of annuities, all the crooks and turns, and all\r\nthe advantages of barter, discount and fellowship. While of Natural\r\nPhilosophy, Chemistry, Botany, Mineralogy, Geology and other sciences,\r\ndirectly or indirectly connected with agriculture, they remain as\r\nignorant as if they never were to apply any of the principles to\r\npractice. Can it then be wondered that agriculture has advanced so\r\nlittle? Ought we not rather to wonder that it has advanced so much as\r\nit has, since so little pains are taken to qualify our youth to make\r\nimprovement in it? As an art it is perhaps more capable of improvement\r\nthan any other, because the sciences on which it is founded, are more\r\nnumerous and more extensive in their nature.\r\n\r\nBy whom are improvements to be made? by men whose knowledge of the art\r\nhas never deviated from the beaten track which their forefathers had\r\ntrodden, and this knowledge was bequeathed to them with this condition,\r\n\"thus far shalt thou go and no farther?\" Common sense answers in\r\nthe negative. Do we expect important improvements in our present\r\nsystems of agriculture, from men who have been educated merchants\r\nor schoolmasters? Their minds cannot be sufficiently interested in\r\nsuch subjects to pursue them either with ardour or with profit. They\r\nhave never acquired a taste for those studies which would render the\r\ndifferent operations of farming a series of philosophical experiments.\r\n\r\nIn too many instances, farmers' sons, who have been educated as\r\nabove described, lose all relish for their occupation, and engage in\r\nsome mercantile business. In many instances they contrive to worry\r\nthrough life without deserting their calling, though they receive\r\nlittle pleasure from any part of it, except counting the money which\r\nit yields. The source from which we have received our new systems of\r\nfarming lay in quite a different quarter. Inhabitants of cities, or men\r\nwho have been educated for some learned profession, are our teachers\r\nin the rules of husbandry. We will suppose these men to be well\r\nversed in the sciences above alluded to. But have they ever learned\r\ntheir application to agriculture? If not, as well might they adduce\r\nprinciples on that subject, as a person to attempt solving an abstruse\r\nproblem in surveying, who has only learned the elements of geometry.\r\nWhen I spoke of an _agricultural education_, I did not confine my\r\nviews to the sciences above specified. _Practice_ is an indispensable\r\npart of this education. The chemist may sit in his laboratory and\r\ngive us a system of agriculture, stolen from European treatises, and\r\nmay occasionally sprinkle it with some hard words of his own; but\r\nit is only the _practical and scientific farmer_ that can draw from\r\nthis heterogenous mass, all that is valuable and applicable to his\r\nown purpose, and nothing more. The principles he receives from books\r\nmust be tested by experiment. To make important deductions from these\r\nexperiments, unwearied patience must be exercised, in order to sift\r\nreal conclusions from those which are only plausible. Let him not sit\r\ndown supinely, after having ascertained a rule, for general rules in\r\nthis science as in most others have their exceptions, and an accurate\r\nknowledge of these exceptions will require much time for discernment,\r\nand investigation. If agriculture, then, is an art of calling forth all\r\nthe faculties of the mind, why is it not taught like other arts by a\r\nregular and systematic education?\r\n\r\n                                                               AGRICOLA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCER.\r\n\r\n_On the Grape Vine, with its wines, brandies, salt, and dried fruits._\r\n\r\nNo. II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of these papers is to excite to objects of agriculture,\r\nmanufacture, commerce, and consumption of the utmost importance to\r\nthe prosperity of our country. The forms and niceties of literary\r\ncomposition will yield their claim to attention to the more solid\r\nsubstance of the pertinent information and suggestions.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the consideration of this subject, several letters\r\nfrom living friends to our prosperity have been brought together. The\r\nremainder of this paper will be appropriated to the publication of one\r\nof those letters, of very recent date, from a native of the United\r\nStates, of the best opportunities, in _Bordeaux_, the emporium of that\r\npart of the kingdom of France which gives to us the largest quantities\r\nof the most esteemed wines and brandies which enter into our regular\r\nconsumption. It here follows, in its own clear and instructive terms.\r\n\r\n\"I have been favoured by your letter of the 24th. _Chaptal_, sur la\r\nCulture de Vine, _l'Abbe Rozier's_ memoire sur le mellieure maniere\r\nde faire et gouverner les Vins, and _Jullien's_ Topographie de tout\r\nles Vignobles, are the authors the most in repute in France on the\r\nvine and on wine. The first and last can be had in Philadelphia; and\r\nif _Rozier's_ memoir is not to be found, as it is an old book, you\r\ncan doubtless find at your French book stores, his Dictionary of\r\nAgriculture, 5 vols. in 4to. which, under the head of _Vine_, will give\r\nyou all the information you desire.\r\n\r\n\"The district which produces the best wine, about Bordeaux, is _Medoc_.\r\nThat county is divided into upper and lower _Medoc_, lying between the\r\nGironde and Garonne and the Bay of Biscay. It is much such a country,\r\nas to hill and dale, or general surface, as that between Philadelphia\r\nand Trenton, of a sandy, sandy-loam, and gravelly soil, with some\r\nfew exceptions of small patches. About seven leagues from north to\r\nsouth, and three from east to west, of this district, is occupied with\r\nvineyards, which produce the best wine, whose expositions are from\r\neast to south.\r\n\r\n\"In this district, Lafitte, Chateau Margaux, Latour, Leoville, La Rose,\r\nBraune Mouton, and St. Julien, with various other qualities of Claret,\r\nare produced, which bring from $60 dollars the ton, of 4 hogsheads, (or\r\n252 gallons,) to $600, according to the estimation they are held in.\r\nThe vines in this district are not suffered to grow above three feet\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n\"_Hautbriant_ is produced on a single estate of that name, lying in\r\nLa Grave, about a league south of Bordeaux. The soil is sandy and\r\ngravelly; so much so that you would hardly suppose it capable of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\n\"The districts which produce _Sauterne_, _Barsac_, and _Grave_ wines,\r\nlie from the skirts of the city south about four leagues, presenting\r\nmuch the same swell of surface as that part of New Jersey through which\r\nthe mail runs between Trenton and Brunswick. The name of this district,\r\n(or, more properly speaking, the northern part of it,) _Grave_, denotes\r\nits soil _Gravier_--_Gravel_. I have seen hundreds of acres of vines in\r\n_Grave_, growing in pebbles, from the size of a bean and nutmeg to that\r\nof an egg, without the least vestige of earth, cracking under foot,\r\nand filling one's shoes. Of the white wines of Bordeaux, _Sauterne_,\r\n_Barsac_, and _Corbonnieux_ are of the first quality; but there are\r\nmany other growths which vie with them, and the ordinary qualities of\r\nthese white wines are various. I have purchased good pleasant white\r\nwine at six dollars the cask of sixty-three gallons. The quantities\r\nsent to this country cost from $12 the cask to $40. Of the other wines\r\nyou mention, I have no knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"It has been stated that two millions of acres are taken up in the\r\ncultivation of the vine, in France, producing, one year with another,\r\nfive hogsheads of sixty-three gallons to the acre; which, at the\r\nmoderate price of fifty francs, or ten dollars, the hogshead, gives\r\none hundred millions of dollars. This produce is immense; and, what\r\nrenders it still more valuable is, that it does not lessen the quantity\r\nof other necessary productions, such as wheat, &c.; for where the\r\nvine generally grows _in France_, nothing else will grow: such is the\r\npoverty of the soil generally employed for vines.\r\n\r\n\"They have the wild vine in France. I have seen large quantities of it\r\nnear _Bayonne_, and round the foot of the Pyrenees, up to _Pau_: the\r\ninhabitants make beautiful hedges of it, and I have been assured by\r\na distinguished naturalist, Mr. Pennieres, who is now in the Alabama\r\nterritory, that some of the excellent grapes of France have been\r\nproduced from the wild vine, after some years of careful cultivation.\r\nHe is now engaged in inoculating our wild vines with those of France,\r\nfrom which he expects the most favourable results.\r\n\r\n\"I shall conclude these hasty observations by an extract from _Rozier_:\r\n\r\n\"'The vine is a plant whose transpiration and _suction_ is _abundant_\r\nand _vehement, which sufficiently indicates the soil and exposition\r\nnatural to it_. For this reason, grounds, _composed of sand, gravel\r\nstones, and rotten rocks_, are excellent for its cultivation.\r\n\r\n\"'A _sandy_ soil produces _a fine pure_ wine. The _gravelly_ and\r\n_stony_ a delicate wine. Rotten and broken rocks a fumy generous wine,\r\nof a superior quality.\r\n\r\n\"'A rich, strong, compact, cold or humid soil, which is pressed down\r\nby the rains, and which the sun hardens or bakes, is essentially\r\nprejudicial to the quality of the wine.\r\n\r\n\"'The most advantageous exposition for the vine is that of a gentle\r\nslope, or side of a hill, facing east and south, on which the rays of\r\nthe sun continue the longest time.\r\n\r\n\"'Hills, in the neighbourhood of the ocean and rivers, ought to be\r\npreferred to all others.' The lower parts of these hills are not so\r\nfavourable to the vine as the upper, and neither are equal to the\r\nmiddle region, the soil being the same.\r\n\r\n\"'_All trees are unfriendly to the vine_, as much from their roots as\r\ntheir shade. All who cultivate the vine, should remember this precept\r\nof Virgil: _Apertos Bacchus amat colles._--The vine flourishes in the\r\nopen unshaded hills.\r\n\r\n\"'In a word, the vine ought never to be planted in soils that can\r\nproduce grain, &c. because it wants nothing but heat, and thrives best\r\nin the poorest ground. This will appear ridiculous to those who look\r\nfor _quantity_: but as to the quality of the wine, it is in strict\r\nconformity with the laws of vegetation and with experience. I must\r\nbe understood to speak here of countries only whose temperatures are\r\nfavourable to the success of vineyards. We must except those in more\r\nnorthern latitudes. These general precepts admit of no exceptions: They\r\nwill be acknowledged by all those who, with good faith, and free of\r\nprejudices, have studied the cultivation of the vine. If other modes\r\nand precepts are followed, we cannot answer for the age of the vine, or\r\nthe quality of the wine.'\"\r\n\r\nThese views of the locality, soils, and exposures of the fine\r\n_Bordeaux_ wines, such as the white, or _Sauterne_, and _vin de Grave_,\r\nand the red or clarets, such as _La Fitte_, _Chateau Margaux_, &c. will\r\nbe left, for the present, on the public mind, with a firm confidence in\r\ntheir due impression, accompanied by the remarks that the difference\r\nbetween our temperatures, in our present wooded condition, and that\r\nof the south west of France, may be safely taken at eleven or twelve\r\ndegrees; and that the progress of clearing lands and draining swamps\r\nwill reduce that difference, in a few years, below ten degrees. Thus,\r\nSt. Mary's, in Georgia, will ultimately prove about as warm, for\r\nvegetation, as Oporto in Portugal, and the productions of Europe,\r\nin any given latitude, may be found in, or, as we drain and clear,\r\nintroduced into the United States, in latitudes nine or ten degrees\r\nfarther south.

By WILLIAM\r\nTILGHMAN, L. L. D.; chief justice of the State of Pennsylvania, and one\r\nof the Vice Presidents of the Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nADDRESS.\r\n\r\nGentlemen of the Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\nWhen you did me the honour of requesting me to deliver this Address,\r\nyou did not expect that I should enter into minute details of the\r\nprocess of Agriculture. Such an attempt might expose my own ignorance,\r\nbut could not add to your information. The object of our Society is\r\n_the promotion of Agriculture_. Whatever conduces to this end, either\r\nimmediately or even remotely, is worthy of our attention, and within\r\nthe scope of our Association. In this view of the subject, I perceive\r\nso wide a range, that there is less difficulty in finding objects,\r\nthan in making a proper selection. To call forth the exertions of\r\nthe Society its zeal must be excited. But zeal is not to be excited,\r\nwithout a conviction of the importance of the cause in which we are\r\nengaged. May I be permitted then, to declare my conviction, that amidst\r\nthe profusion of Societies with which the present age abounds, there is\r\nnone more useful, or more dignified, than that for the _promotion of\r\nAgriculture_. Indeed, in point of _utility_, I might justly say that\r\nit _precedes_ all others. Because, even if mankind could exist without\r\nAgriculture, yet they could exist only in a savage state, and in small\r\nnumbers. The great command \"_increase and multiply_,\" could not be\r\nobeyed. There could be nothing worthy the name of art, or science, or\r\nliterature. When I cast my eye on the map of Pennsylvania, and view\r\nthe vast quantity of excellent land, in the rude state in which nature\r\nformed it, I am struck with astonishment at the multitudes which throng\r\nour cities, struggling with hunger, cold, and disease. Nor is my wonder\r\nconfined to the lower orders of society. For I see many of liberal\r\neducation, and with the means of acquiring a competency in the country,\r\nwasting their lives in disgraceful idleness, or fruitless efforts\r\nto force their way through the crowds which block up every avenue\r\nto profit or preferment. The flood of commerce which set upon our\r\nshores during five and twenty years of war and disorder in Europe, has\r\ngiven to our cities a premature growth. In every branch of trade and\r\ncommerce there are too many competitors. Labourers are too numerous.\r\nEvery mechanic art, every liberal profession is overdone. Happy would\r\nit be for the city, and happy for the country, if any efforts of this\r\nSociety could inspire a respect, and a taste, for an _art_ in which no\r\nman need be ashamed to employ his faculties; for a _condition_, which\r\nafter all, seems most congenial to the nature of man. It is a life,\r\nto which, at one time or other, we all aspire. For who is there, that\r\namidst the eager pursuit of wealth or ambition, does not sometimes\r\npause, and console himself with the fond, though often fallacious hope,\r\nof passing his latter days in the independence, the ease, the plenty,\r\nthe safety, and the innocence of the country! In Pennsylvania, young\r\nmen of education would have peculiar advantages in spreading themselves\r\nthrough the country, for it is a fact (and we are every day feeling\r\nthe effects of it) that in no state in the union, is education so much\r\nconfined to towns. There are many inhabitants of this city, who hold\r\nextensive tracts of land, which neither they nor their children have\r\never seen. This is a bad state of things. For, through ignorance of\r\nthe quality, the situation, and value of their lands, these persons\r\nare sometimes a prey to speculators, and sometimes, erring on the\r\ncontrary extreme, they conceive extravagant notions, and refuse to\r\nsell at a fair price. Hence Agriculture suffers--either the land\r\nremains a desert, or they are occupied by poor intruders, who knowing\r\nthe instability of their title, are afraid to attempt any valuable\r\nimprovement. These people, with few exceptions, lead a wretched life,\r\nand are apt to imbibe sentiments hostile to the proprietors of the\r\nsoil, whom they consider as natural enemies. Could the parties but see\r\neach other, very different feelings might prevail. A little kindness\r\nand condescension on the part of the proprietor, might convert a\r\ndiscontented trespasser, into a useful tenant or purchaser. That this\r\nhas happened in many instances, I know; which induces me to think,\r\nthat were the trial made, it would happen in many more. Where large\r\nproperty of this kind, is in the hands of heads of families with\r\nseveral children, one or two of the sons might manage the estate to\r\ngreat advantage, by living on the spot. Agents are expensive, and often\r\nunfaithful. But one may confide in his own blood. Besides, the very\r\ncircumstance of a well educated young man residing in any place, will\r\nnaturally attract others of similar qualifications, to the same spot;\r\nand thus an agreeable society might be formed, and great encouragement\r\nafforded to the labouring poor of the neighbourhood. In this kind\r\nof policy, the state of New York has set us a good example. And the\r\nconsequences of her conduct are obvious; a greater proportion of her\r\nlands is settled, and her unsettled lands, of equal quality, sell for\r\na higher price than ours. Although the views of our society are not\r\nconfined to the limits of the state, and our earnest wishes are for\r\nthe prosperity of the whole, and every part of the union, yet it may\r\nbe considered as our duty to direct our attention more particularly\r\nto Pennsylvania. We cannot be accused then of acting with ungenerous\r\npolicy, if we endeavour to promote the settlement of our own lands in\r\npreference to those of our neighbours. We may, without impropriety,\r\nsuggest all fair and honourable arguments, to convince the emigrants\r\nfrom the eastern states, and from Europe, that it is their interest\r\nto establish themselves here, rather than seek a residence in a\r\ndistant country, to the west or the south. It is not my intention to\r\nenter deeply into this subject. It might be enough, to suggest to the\r\nSociety, the utility of circulating good pamphlets, which have already\r\nbeen written, or may be written hereafter. But, one or two leading\r\nfacts it may not be amiss to mention. The rich productions of the\r\nsouth, are not to be attained, but by men of considerable capital.\r\nThe object is tempting, but when offered to the consideration of\r\nemigrants from Europe, or our sister states to the eastward, they will\r\nremember that the climate where rice, cotton, tobacco, indigo, and\r\nsugar flourish, is generally unfavourable to health; and that these\r\narticles are not to be cultivated to advantage, without slaves. They\r\nhave therefore to engage in a new kind of life, opposed to the habits\r\nand principles in which they have been educated, and which, however\r\nflattering the outset, will probably terminate in an enfeebled body and\r\ndiscontented mind.\r\n\r\nBut the great class of emigrants, is that of people who have small\r\ncapitals, and must seek their bread, by the labour of their own hands.\r\nTo such persons, health is every thing. The languid eye of sickness\r\ndwells without pleasure, on the fairest prospects of nature. In vain is\r\nthe fertile bottom, or the rich prairie, offered to the arm unnerved\r\nby disease. It is a notorious fact, that rich, low, level countries,\r\nare subject to fevers. They should therefore be shunned by those who\r\nare to live by their own labour. Another great inconvenience in those\r\ncountries is, that they are badly supplied with water, either for\r\ndrinking or machinery. If, indeed, the lands in the western region,\r\nwere extremely cheap, and those in Pennsylvania at a price beyond\r\nthe reach of a poor man, he must go to the west from necessity. But\r\nthat is not the case,--our lands are believed to be as low priced, as\r\nthose beyond the Ohio; and much more so, when there is taken into the\r\ncalculation (as there ought to be) the expense of the journey. Another\r\nimportant circumstance in our favour, is a much better market for the\r\nsale of our productions, and the purchase of necessary articles. This\r\nis important at all times, but peculiarly in war, when the Mississippi,\r\nthe only inlet or outlet of the whole western country, may be blockaded\r\nby a hostile fleet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed, that the interests of Agriculture and of\r\nCommerce are at variance. On the contrary, they are inseparable. Of\r\nthis the Agriculturists of the United States have had good proof.\r\nNo persons on earth have profited more by commerce. During the long\r\nwars of Europe, the staple productions of the middle states sold at\r\ndouble price, and those of the southern states were very high, both\r\nduring the war and after. Those prices were produced, in part, by the\r\ninflux of wealth, which occasioned an increased consumption at home,\r\nand in part by exportation to foreign countries, but principally by\r\nthe latter. Both causes, however, sprang from commerce; and both, as\r\nlong as commerce exists, will continue to operate in a greater or\r\nless degree. Indeed, if we could suppose a nation cut off from all\r\nintercourse with other nations, (that is, from all foreign commerce)\r\nthat nation, though abounding in all the necessaries of life, would be\r\nbarbarous, selfish, illiteral, and ignorant. Neither let us give way to\r\nthe idea, that either agriculture, or commerce, are incompatible with\r\ndomestic manufactures. Unwise laws, may injure either one or the other,\r\nby unjust preferences; but under proper regulations, they will aid,\r\nand invigorate each other. This is not the place for entering into a\r\ndisquisition of the degree of encouragement which should be afforded by\r\n_law_, to manufactures. That important subject is before the national\r\nlegislature, where it will no doubt, receive an impartial and mature\r\nconsideration. But thus much may be said, with certainty; that it is\r\nthe _duty_, as well as the _interest_, of all of us, to use _our own_,\r\nin preference to _foreign_ manufactures, where they can be furnished\r\non reasonable terms. It cannot be denied, that manufactures afford a\r\nsure market, for the productions of the neighbouring country; and as\r\nthey are multiplied, in the same ratio, are the markets increased. And\r\nthere is a peculiar advantage in markets of this kind, at a distance\r\nfrom navigable waters; that, the consumption being at home, the\r\nexpense of carriage is saved. But, there is a kind of manufacture,\r\n_domestic in the strictest sense_, the benefit of which is inestimable,\r\nbecause while it adds to the _stock_ of the family, it protects their\r\n_morals_.--I allude to spinning, weaving, and such things as are\r\ndone by the hands of the husband, the wife, or the children, without\r\nleaving their home. It guards them against _idleness_, that child of\r\nfolly, and parent of vice, and is often clear gain, as it occupies\r\nthose hours which would have been passed in inaction. I am afraid,\r\nthat in this kind of industry, we have rather degenerated. A very\r\nrespectable gentleman, a member of the Society of Friends, informed me,\r\nthat about the year 1764, he attended a meeting, in Chester county,\r\nnear the borders of Maryland, and that most of his society in that\r\nneighbourhood, were clothed _completely_ and _handsomely_ in dress\r\nof their own manufacture. Were he to visit that meeting now, I doubt\r\nwhether he would see his friends in the same kind of apparel. Yet\r\nmeritorious examples are not wanting, even now, and I hope I shall be\r\nexcused for mentioning one lately communicated to me. In the western\r\npart of Pennsylvania, on this side of the Alleghany river, lives a\r\nman, who, ten or twelve years ago, seated himself on a tract of land,\r\nto which he had no title, in the humble character of a _squatter_.[11]\r\nThis man has converted a wilderness into a fine farm; and, with the\r\nassistance of an industrious wife, brought up a large family of\r\nchildren. He raises on his farm all the materials for clothing the\r\nfamily; and whatever they wear, of linen or woollen texture, excellent\r\nin their kinds, is spun, woven, and manufactured in the house. They\r\nalso make their own sugar, from the maple; and their own leather; and\r\n_purchase_ (or rather _barter_ for) nothing but iron, and salt. Their\r\nfarming utensils are chiefly homemade.--But what is more commendable\r\nthan all (and perhaps the cause of all) _very little whiskey or ardent\r\nspirits is drunk_ by any of them. To finish the picture, I have to add,\r\nthat the proprietor of the land, with views, no less _politic_ than\r\n_liberal_, has confirmed these good people in their title, on moderate\r\nterms--so that this little story contains a moral, from which, both\r\n_settlers_, and _proprietors_, may profit.\r\n\r\n[11] A term in use, in New York and Pennsylvania, to denote a man who\r\nseats himself on land to which he has no title.\r\n\r\nIt has been apprehended by some, that the late fall in the price of\r\nland, and its productions, would damp the ardour of cultivators,\r\nand deter men of capital from employing their funds in the purchase\r\nof real property. This apprehension appears to be ill founded. If\r\nthe profits of farming have been diminished, so likewise have the\r\nprofits of all other business; so that there is no particular reason\r\nfor withholding funds from an investment in land. We are in a state\r\nof distress, which I trust, will be but temporary; for the country\r\nhas great resources, and sufficient knowledge to bring them into\r\naction. A stagnation of commerce was to be expected, on the cessation\r\nof the wars in Europe.[12] But this stagnation is not peculiar to\r\nAmerica--she shares it in common with all the world--we have indeed,\r\nparticular distress, arising from our own errors, on the subject of\r\nbanks. An immoderate issue of bank paper, afforded an unhappy facility\r\nof borrowing. The money when borrowed, must be made use of in some\r\nway--many of the borrowers, having no good use for it, either trifled\r\nit away, in unnecessary expenses, or in the purchase of land, which\r\nsoon rose, nominally, to twice its value. Such a state of things could\r\nnot last long--the delusion is past. It is to be lamented, that many\r\ngood people have been the victims of this infatuation; but we must\r\ncomfort ourselves with the hope, that some good will result from it, if\r\na cure is not attempted by rash and violent means. As a people, we had\r\nbecome too extravagant and too luxurious. The slow but sure progress\r\nof industry was despised. Every man was in haste to be rich, by some\r\nvisionary project, dignified with the name of _speculation_. But we\r\nare now suffering for these follies, and by suffering, we shall be\r\npurified, and brought back to better habits. This will be a lasting\r\ngood. Instead of desponding then, let us prosecute our business with\r\nincreased vigour and economy, and we shall soon find, that although\r\nwe have fewer paper dollars, we have more real wealth, and what is of\r\nmuch greater importance, better morals, and of course more happiness.\r\nA large capital is at present locked up, because the owners are in\r\ndoubt how to employ it. When business shall flow in decided channels,\r\nthis capital will be brought into activity. It is almost certain, that\r\nneither commerce, nor bank stock will be as profitable as they have\r\nbeen; so that there is a strong probability of an investment of a\r\nlarge capital, in real estate, which, after all, possesses a stability\r\nunknown to any other kind of property.\r\n\r\n[12] In a letter of the late President Adams, published since the\r\ndelivery of this Address, he says he remembers that the like depression\r\nof commerce, manufactures and real estate, took place after the wars,\r\nwhich ended in 1748, 1763, and 1783.\r\n\r\nBut, it is in our own power, to increase the value of our lands by\r\nan improved state of Agriculture. Much has been done, but much more\r\nremains to be done. Though not at the bottom of the hill, we have\r\nnot yet ascended half its height. It may be encouraging however to\r\nstop for a moment, and take a glance at the progress we have made.\r\nBefore the war of the revolution, little of science was blended with\r\nthe art of agriculture--things had gone on in their natural course.\r\nThe counties first settled, now known by the names of Philadelphia,\r\nDelaware, Chester, Montgomery, and Bucks, though not rich (except the\r\nmeadows) were sufficient to yield good crops at first, and tolerable\r\nones for a number of years. But the soil near the surface, composed of\r\nvegetable substances accumulated during the lapse of ages, became at\r\nlength exhausted by repeated tillage without refreshment. Red clover\r\nwas introduced before the war, but it was produced in small quantities,\r\nand almost solely for the purpose of hay. The system of melioration by\r\na rotation of crops, in which grass took its turn, was not understood.\r\nNatural meadow was in great demand, and not much hay being produced\r\non the uplands, it was impossible to support during winter, a stock\r\nsufficiently large to amass a great quantity of manure. Consequently\r\nthe crops of grain, and particularly of wheat were much diminished.\r\nIndeed, the _wheat_ crops were trifling. Gypsum had been imported, in\r\nsmall quantities before the revolution; but it was very little used,\r\nand very little talked of; and that little not to its credit, for an\r\nold proverb, said to come from Germany, was brought up against it,\r\n\"_that gypsum made rich fathers, but poor sons_.\" Notwithstanding this\r\nprejudice, it was brought into general use, some years after the war,\r\nby the persevering efforts of a few, _and principally of the President\r\nof this Society_, to whom future generations will render thanks for\r\nthis important service. Through the efficacy of this fossil, the face\r\nof the country experienced a magic change. The uplands were clothed\r\nwith rich herbage, to which succeeded plenteous crops of grain. I have\r\nnot been able to trace with certainty, the progress of the cultivation\r\nof clover aided by gypsum, but I believe, that Philadelphia was the\r\ncentre, from which it spread in all directions. In Chester county, so\r\ngreat were its effects, that (as I heard it proved in the trial of a\r\ncause at West Chester,) the price of lands was doubled in a few years.\r\nNor is there any reason to suppose that it was less beneficial in other\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nBut as the excess of even a good thing may be pernicious, so may it be\r\nwith gypsum. That it promotes the growth of many vegetables, and of\r\nclover in particular, is certain; though its mode of operation does\r\nnot seem to be clearly understood. An increased quantity of grass,\r\nwill support an increased quantity of stock, from which will proceed\r\nan increased quantity of manure, and that should be considered as the\r\ngreat end of gypsum. Not that great advantages may not be derived\r\nfrom ploughing in the green clover. But if that is relied on, as the\r\nonly mode of meliorating the soil, (and in some publications which I\r\nhave seen, it is asserted to be quite sufficient) we shall probably\r\nbe disappointed. In Sir John Sinclair's Code of Agriculture, it is\r\nsaid that the practice of ploughing in green vegetables, as a manure,\r\nhas been tried, in England, and found not to answer; and that more\r\nbenefit is derived from those crops, when they are consumed by stock,\r\nand converted into dung; and Col. John Taylor, (of Caroline county,\r\nVirginia) to whose valuable labours the world is so much indebted,\r\nis also of opinion, that we ought not to rely on green vegetables\r\nonly. In the first edition of his _Arator_, he seemed to think, that\r\nnothing more was necessary than clover, but in the second edition, he\r\nacknowledged his error, which had been demonstrated by the result of\r\ntwo crops of Indian corn. In 80 acres of land, improved by turning in\r\nthe grass, without other manure, the crop averaged 25 bushels an acre.\r\nBut in 200 acres, where the clover was turned in and the ground also\r\nmanured, the average was 50 bushels. It is probable, indeed, that the\r\nploughing in of clover, may have a greater effect in many parts of\r\nthe United States, than in England. For, that large crops of grain\r\nhave been produced by it, is so strongly attested, that it must not\r\nbe denied. This may be owing to the Superior efficacy of the gypsum,\r\nwhich, no doubt, acts more powerfully here, than generally in England,\r\nand therefore produces a greater quantity of clover. But, as it is\r\ncertain, that the manure of dung, incorporated with putrefied vegetable\r\nmatter, is more efficacious than simple green vegetables; what I\r\nintend, is to exhort our farmers not to trust to the latter alone, nor\r\nrelax their efforts to collect the former in as great quantities as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAnother important circumstance is to be attended to. We are not to\r\nexpect, that land will continue to produce luxuriant crops of clover,\r\nfor ever, even when aided by gypsum.--It would be contrary to the order\r\nof nature; which delights in change. Our _second_ crop of clover,\r\nhas, for many years, been of little value, though the cause remains\r\nunexplained. A gentleman of veracity, who lives on the Delaware,\r\nbetween eight or ten miles above the city, assured me, that gypsum,\r\nwhich had done wonders for a long time, had at length ceased to have\r\nany effect on his land; and that the same was the case of some of his\r\nneighbours. I am informed also, that the same remark has been made by\r\nfarmers in Montgomery county. Now it is not to be supposed, that the\r\ngypsum has changed its nature, or lost its virtue.--But the earth,\r\nbeing exhausted of those particles which are favourable to the growth\r\nof clover, no longer offers to the gypsum the same matter to act upon.\r\nThat the matter, necessary for the formation of a particular plant, may\r\nbe exhausted, while the same earth suffices for the vigorous production\r\nof other plants, is proved by daily experience; and is an accordance\r\nwith the best theory.\r\n\r\nIn a late English publication, there is an offer of a considerable\r\npremium to the person who shall discover a grass which shall be a good\r\nsubstitute for clover, it being understood that clover no longer grew\r\nas formerly; and of another premium to the person who shall discover\r\nthe means of restoring lands, which once bore clover, to a capacity of\r\nproducing it again. It would, therefore, be wise in us, to look out in\r\ntime, for some grass, to take the place of clover, when it shall be\r\nfound no longer to succeed. In the mean time, we may avail ourselves\r\n(and it may perhaps be a very long time) of the united efficacy of\r\ngypsum and clover.\r\n\r\nI said that we had much to do before we attained that degree of\r\nperfection which was practicable in agriculture. I presume, that our\r\nlands, in their natural state, were full as good as those of England.\r\nIn England, the average crops of grain of all kinds, on 8,000,000\r\nof acres, are estimated at twenty-four bushels the acre. I take\r\nthis estimate from Sir John Sinclair, who says, moreover, that in\r\n\"fertile districts and propitious seasons, from thirty-two to forty\r\nbushels of wheat an acre, may be confidently expected; from forty-two\r\nto fifty of barley, from fifty-two to sixty-four of oats, and from\r\ntwenty-eight to thirty-two of beans.\" The best county in Pennsylvania,\r\nis supposed to be Lancaster. The matter cannot be spoken of with any\r\nkind of certainty; but, from the best information I have been able to\r\ncollect, I should doubt whether the _wheat_ crops of the whole county\r\nof Lancaster, averaged more than fifteen bushels an acre, though many\r\nindividual farmers get from twenty to thirty; and some from thirty to\r\nforty. But, when we compare the agriculture of two countries, we must\r\ntake it in large masses. Penn's Valley, in Pennsylvania, is supposed to\r\nyield crops of _wheat_, averaging at least twenty bushels an acre; but\r\nthat is owing to something peculiar in the climate; for the crops do\r\nnot ripen in less than two weeks later than in most other parts of the\r\nstate. The soil in Penn's valley, is limestone, and the water lies very\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that the agriculture of Pennsylvania is\r\nsteadily improving, and is at present actually improved as highly as\r\nthat of any state in the union. In buildings for agricultural purposes\r\n(perhaps too expensive) she is unrivalled; so that without being over\r\nsanguine, we may promise ourselves an annual increase of the value of\r\nour lands. How this progress may be quickened, is a question which\r\nthis Society should keep constantly in view.--To devise the means\r\nof acceleration, should be their study.--To the first great step\r\ntowards general improvement, the organization of societies in every\r\npart of the state, we have one what was in our power, by petitioning\r\nthe legislature to take the subject into consideration, and aid the\r\nundertaking with necessary funds. Nor is there any reason to doubt\r\nof success; for the legislature is always liberal when the general\r\ninterest demands it. The institution of county societies, with the\r\ndistribution of premiums, will be a powerful stimulus to the dormant\r\nfaculties of thousands. The Eastern States, including New York, have\r\nalready made the experiment with success; and I honour them for the\r\nexample. Our Society, being situated in the capital, has the best\r\nmeans of correspondence; so that we can reciprocate information on\r\nagricultural subjects, with the different societies throughout this,\r\nand other states, and with countries beyond the sea. Hence will be\r\ncollected a stock of knowledge, which being condensed, and methodized,\r\nmay be offered to the public with great advantage.\r\n\r\nA pattern farm is an object we have long had at heart, and it is not\r\nto be relinquished. But the time is not come, for carrying our wishes\r\ninto effect. At present, we have not sufficient funds; and to incur a\r\ndebt, in our corporate capacity, without the means of payment, would\r\njustly dishonour us. But the want of a pattern farm may be in some\r\nmeasure supplied, by the exertions of members of the society, who\r\npossess farms within a few miles of the city. Some of them are blessed\r\nwith ample means, as well as inclination, to give a fair trial to every\r\nimprovement which can be rationally suggested, either in instruments\r\nof husbandry, the application of manures, or the cultivation of new\r\nplants, grains, or grasses.\r\n\r\nWe may render ourselves useful, by collecting and diffusing the\r\ninformation contained in books recently published in Europe or America.\r\nIn Europe the principal nobility and gentry are paying due honours to\r\nAgriculture. Chemistry has been called to her aid, from which important\r\ndiscoveries must result. Earths, minerals, and manures of all kinds are\r\nanalysed. Philosophy is in the right path. Facts are first ascertained,\r\nand then accounted for. The increased power of magnifying glasses,\r\nlays open the hidden parts of plants, and minute animals. Hence may be\r\ndiscovered the _causes_, and consequently the _cure_, of many disorders\r\nby which plants are infested. Already it is asserted, (I vouch not for\r\nthe truth of it) that the disease in wheat called the _smut_, is no\r\nother than a parasite plant, which adhering to the seed-wheat, grows\r\nwith it, and may be destroyed by proper applications, before the seed\r\nis sown. Perhaps some fortunate observer may let us into the nature\r\nof that scourge of Agriculture, known by the name of the Hessian fly,\r\nso that we may get rid of it, as we did of the weevil fly, some forty\r\nyears ago. Such a man would deserve a statue of gold, and I think the\r\nfarmers would gladly erect it.\r\n\r\nAnother point of duty, to which we have not been wanting, is the\r\nimportation of such foreign grains, grasses, and plants, as are\r\nsuitable to our climate. Of all the grains which now grow in the\r\nmiddle states, I recollect none, but maize, (Indian corn) which\r\nis native. Perhaps we have not yet collected all which might be\r\nprofitably cultivated; and even if we have, a change of seed is of\r\ngreat importance. What wealth has flowed into the southern states, from\r\ncotton, which, thirty years ago, was scarce known there! Something new\r\nis always turning up, and we should be on the alert, to avail ourselves\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThe Society has heretofore given admonition of the necessity of change\r\nin seed-grain. I do not mean merely the change of one grain for another\r\nof a different kind, (as _wheat_ for _rye_, &c.) but a change of seed,\r\nwhere there is no change of kind. Farmers do not seem aware of this\r\nnecessity, nor of the great advantage of procuring seed of the very\r\nbest kind, and cleaning it in the most perfect manner. Or if they are\r\naware, they are deterred from paying attention to it, by a little\r\ntrouble and a little expense. It would be well to keep the subject\r\nbefore their eyes, until a conviction of its importance shall produce\r\nan alteration of practice.\r\n\r\nThe importation of foreign animals is not to be neglected. It is not\r\nthe business of this Society, nor have they the means of importing\r\nthem;--but they may point them out. We have, in Pennsylvania, good\r\nhorses; but in the best breeds of cattle, hogs and sheep, we are\r\ndefective. I know that some enterprising gentlemen in the city have\r\ngone to great expense in importing cattle, and others are in possession\r\nof excellent breeds of hogs, but they are not yet diffused through\r\nthe state. It is understood, that in the Eastern States, no pains or\r\nexpense have been spared, in procuring animals of the finest shape\r\nand quality. But it may be some time, before they have a surplus for\r\nexportation.\r\n\r\nWe are well situated for obtaining models of all newly invented\r\nimplements of husbandry. Our workmen are ingenious, and able to execute\r\nany thing which is planned for them; and the genius of our countrymen\r\nin the application of the mechanic powers, is conspicuous. The high\r\nprice of labour, rendered its abridgement of primary importance. What\r\nwonderful effects have been produced by Whitney's cotton gin? We are\r\nwell supplied with implements for breaking the earth, and for cutting\r\nall kinds of straw, and cheap machines for shelling Indian corn. But a\r\nmachine effectual for the threshing of wheat, and not too high-priced,\r\nis a desideratum. The machine for dressing flax, of British invention,\r\nis said to be a very great improvement, but is not yet much in use\r\namong us.\r\n\r\nRoads, bridges, canals, and all internal public improvements, are\r\nsubjects, which though not within our control, have such an immediate\r\nbearing on Agriculture, by expediting and cheapening carriage, that\r\nit will be always proper to do what little is in our power, for their\r\nsuccess. Works of such magnitude are not to be executed, without the\r\ncombined exertions of many persons, sanctioned by the authority of the\r\nlegislature, and assisted by the public purse. Our legislature has\r\ndone nobly for roads and bridges, and we trust it will do the same for\r\ncanals. The first great object of that kind, is the junction of the\r\nwaters of the Susquehanna and the Schuylkill, which empties into the\r\nDelaware. That being accomplished, we may look westward to the waters\r\nof the Alleghany, and northward to the Seneca lake, which being once\r\nentered, and entered it may be with no great difficulty, we have the\r\nDelaware connected with the great northern lakes, by means of the\r\nmagnificent work now in rapid progress, in the state of New York. The\r\nproject is grand;--I may not live to see it executed, yet it is by no\r\nmeans so improbable as many things once appeared, which in my time have\r\nbeen accomplished.\r\n\r\nYet, it must be confessed, that in canals, we linger behind other\r\nstates, who have boldly led the way. Except the works now carrying\r\non, for the improvement of the navigation on the Schuylkill and the\r\nLehigh, we have nothing to show but the Conewago canal of a single\r\nmile, which will be of little use, unless the Susquehanna and Delaware\r\nare united. Our tardiness may be accounted for. Five and twenty years\r\nago, when the Conewago canal was begun, public spirit mounted perhaps\r\ntoo high. Great efforts were made, which, from causes not necessary\r\nnow to mention, proved abortive.--Hence, a despondence on the subject\r\nof canals, from which we have scarce yet recovered. But it is high\r\ntime to rouse ourselves. On the one side we have New York making great\r\nand successful exertions; on the other, Maryland, endeavouring to\r\navail herself of the road, made at the expense of the United States,\r\nfrom Cumberland, on the Potowmac, to Wheeling, on the Ohio; on which\r\nwagons travel free from toll. But, if we can have water carriage from\r\nPhiladelphia to Susquehanna, we shall be on a better footing than\r\nBaltimore; and preserve our wagon carriage to Pittsburg until the\r\nSusquehanna shall be joined to the Alleghany. This wagon carriage is\r\nof immense importance. It has been supposed, that between Philadelphia\r\nand Pittsburg, the yearly sum paid for carriage, amounted to 730,000\r\ndollars. Nor is this the only consideration. A very great sum is\r\nexpended all along the line of the turnpike road, which is diffused\r\nthrough the country to a considerable distance. A six horse wagon\r\nconsumes five bushels of oats a day, besides hay. Now, it appears from\r\nan official return, made by the keeper of the turnpike gate, at the\r\nChesnut Ridge, between Stoys Town, and Greensburg, that there passed\r\nthrough that gate, during the year ending May, 1818; among other\r\nthings, 281 four-horse, 2412 five-horse, and 2698 six-horse teams; and\r\nit is said, that a gentleman, living on the road near Pittsburg, in the\r\nyear 1813, counted the number of wagons, laden with merchandize, which\r\npassed his house that year, and that they amounted to 4055. Through the\r\ncounties of Bedford and Somerset, the road, being generally on ridges,\r\nruns through a poor country, to which the market afforded by the\r\nwagons, is essential. Somerset abounds in _grass_; and for _oats_ is\r\nsuperior to any county in the state.--But the soil is not favourable to\r\nwheat; and, except in the southern part, Indian corn will scarce arrive\r\nat maturity. It appears, clearly, therefore, that the Agriculture\r\nof Pennsylvania is very much interested, even in parts far west of\r\nthe Susquehanna, in a water communication between that river and the\r\nDelaware, as the most effectual means of preserving the land carriage\r\nto Pittsburg. Another weighty consideration is, the protection which\r\nought to be afforded to Pittsburg, against the effect of the United\r\nStates' turnpike from Cumberland to Wheeling. Pittsburg ought to be to\r\nthe western part of the state, what Philadelphia is to the eastern: the\r\nreservoir of wealth sufficient to afford a market to the surrounding\r\ncountry. There is no rivalship between these cities. The prosperity of\r\none promotes the prosperity of the other. Why then should we hesitate?\r\nNew York has completed 120 miles of canal in less than two years and\r\nfive months. By a line of less than half that length, the Delaware and\r\nSusquehanna are united.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania has been accused of want of attention to gardening, and I\r\nam afraid she must plead guilty to the charge. A good kitchen garden\r\ncontributes much to the health, and even the elegance of life; the\r\nsaving of meat makes it a source of economy, and the neatness which is\r\nnecessary to keep it in order, may have an effect on the _manners_\r\nof the family. The females might execute a good deal of the work, and\r\nfor their sake it should be interspersed with flowers. I believe my\r\nfeelings are not at all singular, and I declare that I am struck with\r\na sensation of pleasure, at the sight of a flourishing, well enclosed\r\ngarden. May I be allowed to add, that I have the same feelings, at\r\nsight of a neat inclosure in front of the dwelling house, separating\r\nit from the highway. With surprise and regret, I perceive this often\r\nneglected, by wealthy and liberal farmers, merely because they have\r\nbeen in the habit of living without it. Such things might be remedied\r\nat a very trifling expense, but they are of no trifling consequence.\r\nThey have an influence on manners.\r\n\r\nI say nothing on the subject of _hedges_, their importance, and the\r\nbest mode of raising them have been fully shown by one of our Vice\r\nPresidents, on a former occasion.\r\n\r\nThe limits of this discourse confine me to _hints_, on subjects which\r\nmerit _treatises_. May not means be taken to tincture the youthful\r\nmind, with the spirit of Agriculture? In _colleges_, natural philosophy\r\nand chemistry might sometimes be directed to that special purpose.\r\nBut something may be done at an _earlier age_; particularly where\r\nopportunities are offered, in teaching the learned languages, which\r\nbeing acquired slowly and with difficulty, leave lasting impressions;\r\nfor instance, besides the Georgics of Virgil, which are in general use,\r\nselect passages might be read from Columella, one of the most ancient\r\nwriters on rural affairs, which have reached us, in the Latin tongue.\r\nI am afraid mischief is done, by putting into the hands of boys, those\r\nfinished models of Grecian and Roman eloquence, in which are painted,\r\nin too vivid colours, the pleasures of wine, and love, and the glory of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nHaving touched the subject of education, I will add, that when the\r\nbenevolent intention of the constitution of Pennsylvania, shall be\r\ncarried into effect, by \"_the establishment of schools throughout\r\nthe state, in such manner, that the poor may be taught gratis_,\"\r\nAgriculture will reap her full share of the benefit. Reading, writing,\r\nand common arithmetic, if not essential, are very serviceable to the\r\nfarmer. And even the labourer will derive incalculable advantage from\r\nthe improvement of his intellectual faculties. Work cannot be continued\r\nwithout intermission, and time hangs heavy on the mind which is torpid\r\nduring the hours of repose. Exercise is as necessary to the mind as\r\nthe body. How desirable then, that men should be qualified for that\r\nkind of reading, which gratifies and strengthens the mind, without the\r\nfatigue of severe study, while the body is at rest during the intervals\r\nof labour? Our legislature is not unmindful of the duty imposed by the\r\nconstitution--the act \"to provide for the education of children at the\r\npublic expense within the city and county of Philadelphia,\" is working\r\ngreat good. By the first annual report of the controllers of these\r\nschools, made in February last, it appears that 2845 children were then\r\nin a course of education; and I am informed that the number is now\r\nmuch increased. Moreover, a most important fact is established--that\r\nby adopting the Lancasterian mode of teaching, which will do in all\r\nthickly settled districts, the annual expense will not exceed _four\r\ndollars_ for each child. Upon efforts like these the blessing of God\r\nmay be confidently hoped for.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more effectual for the diffusion of the spirit of\r\nChristianity, than a moderate cultivation of the understanding. Men\r\nwill thus become more mild, better content with the condition in which\r\nProvidence has placed them, more attentive to their duties both moral\r\nand religious, more charitable towards each other, less jealous and\r\nvindictive in their feelings towards foreign nations, less prone to\r\nrapine, under whatever name disguised, and less easily dazzled by the\r\nfalse splendour of war.\r\n\r\nBut I must indulge myself on this topic no longer, lest it seduce me\r\nfrom my main design.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with Agriculture is the subject of leases. Though\r\nnot so important in the United States, as in other countries, because\r\nthe body of tenantry is smaller here, yet it is not undeserving of\r\nattention. The leases generally in use, are for a short term, with a\r\nreservation, by way of rent, of a certain share of the produce of the\r\nland. This system is liable to two great objections. The shortness of\r\nthe tenure, precludes all hope of improvement of the soil, and the mode\r\nof payment, (the rendering a share of the crop,) holds out inducements\r\nto fraud, which few tenants are able to resist. When the landlord\r\nlives upon the estate, he has some chance of checking the tenant, by\r\nobtaining an accurate knowledge of the amount of the crop; and if he\r\nis liberal, he may have something done in the way of improvement. But\r\nwhere he lives at a distance, the probability is, that the estate\r\nwill go to ruin, while he receives but a small part of his due.\r\nThe objections to long leases, for rents in money, are, that if the\r\nlandlord parts with the possession for a long time, he may be injured\r\nby a bad tenant; that he precludes himself from the chance of a sale,\r\nif a good price should be offered, and that the great fluctuations in\r\nthe price of grain, make it impossible to fix a rent in money, without\r\ndanger to both parties. Where a man has it in view to sell his estate,\r\nhe may be right, in making a short lease; that case forms an exception\r\nto the general rule. But where he means to keep it, the objection is\r\nremoved; then, as to fluctuation of price, the matter might be easily\r\nmanaged, by reserving a rent of a certain quantity of grain, giving the\r\ntenant an election to pay the market price, in money, which might be\r\nmore convenient than delivering the grain. That point being settled, a\r\nlease for a longer term, fixing the rotation in which the fields should\r\nbe cultivated, with other proper covenants, would leave the landlord\r\nsufficiently protected, while it gave the tenant encouragement to\r\nmeliorate the soil for his own interest. At the end of such a lease,\r\nthe value of the estate would be increased, and the rent might be\r\nraised. With great deference I submit these remarks to gentlemen of the\r\ncity, who have farms at some distance, or even in the neighbourhood,\r\nwhich are intended as a provision for their families.\r\n\r\nOne thing more remains, which I cannot in conscience pass by, and in\r\nwhich, perhaps the Society may find means to do some good. Can no\r\nmethod be devised, to check the inordinate use of spirituous liquors?\r\nThis shocking habit, strikes at the root of agriculture, by robbing it\r\nof the labour necessary for its support. It would be a waste of time,\r\nto enumerate the ills which flow from this disgraceful vice, because\r\nthey are obvious to everyone. Perhaps a small addition to the wages,\r\nwould induce labourers to forego the use of this poisonous liquid; or\r\nthey might consent to take as a substitute, beer, or cider, or some\r\nother harmless drink. The subject deserves the deepest consideration,\r\nand I cannot help hoping, that when societies shall be organized in the\r\nseveral counties, a plan may be formed, which being acted upon at once,\r\nthroughout the state, may greatly lessen, if not eradicate the evil.\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured, gentlemen, to obey your commands, in hopes that my\r\nexample may call forth the efforts of others, better qualified to do\r\njustice to the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Law Case._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following opinion delivered by JACOB RUSH, President of the Court\r\nof Common Pleas of the City and County of Philadelphia, will be found\r\nparticularly interesting by persons residing in the Country, and who\r\nmay be exposed to controversies about line fences, and their repairs.\r\nThe examination of the provisions of the act of Assembly, and of\r\nthe principles of law on the points involved in the case will be\r\ninteresting and useful to every Lawyer.\r\n\r\n  Overseers of the Poor  } Common Pleas, Philadelphia\r\n      of Byberry,        }       County,\r\n        _vs._            }     Certiorari.\r\n        F.I.             }\r\n\r\nA Certiorari issued out of this Court, directed to Joshua Jones and\r\nElisha Gordon, Esquires, requiring them to transmit certain proceedings\r\nhad before them under the fence law of 1700, in which John T.\r\nTownshend and Israel Walton, Overseers of the poor of Byberry are the\r\ncomplainants, and F. I. the defendant.\r\n\r\nPrior to stating the facts on the return, it will be proper to give a\r\nbrief exposition of the very obscure law upon which the controversy has\r\narisen.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1700, for the regulation of fences, gives authority to fence\r\nviewers in two cases.--1st. Where a person finding a fence actually\r\nerected, takes advantage of such existing fence, and makes it a part of\r\na subsequent enclosure. The person making such subsequent enclosure,\r\nand deriving a benefit from his neighbours fence, is bound to pay one\r\nhalf the expense of such fence. He is equally bound afterwards himself\r\nto keep in repair one half of it, or to pay the expense of repairing\r\nit.--Which leads to the 2d. point, and this consists in the power\r\nthe fence viewers have over fences, either erected or subsequently\r\ndivided, by agreement between two neighbours. The fence viewers cannot\r\ncompel a person to join fences with his neighbour, every man having an\r\nundoubted right to erect a fence upon his own ground. The authority\r\nof the viewers is derived from the consent of the parties expressed\r\nor implied. In the case of a person deriving a benefit from making a\r\nfence actually existing, a part of the enclosure around his own field,\r\nhe virtually agrees by his conduct, to make compensation.--In the 2d.\r\ncase, viz: repairing fences, the parties are supposed to have joined\r\noriginally in erecting the fence, or by some subsequent contract, to\r\nhave come under an engagement to keep in repair a moity of the fence.\r\n\r\nThe viewers being only judges of the value, or of the sufficiency of\r\nfences, cannot order a _new_ fence to be erected. In the former case,\r\nthat is, the value, they are to award compensation; in the latter,\r\nthey are to direct the party delinquent to repair the fence, and in\r\ncase of his neglecting it for ten days, then upon application and\r\nproof thereof before two Justices, they are to order the _persons\r\naggrieved_ to repair the fence, who shall be reimbursed by the party\r\nrefusing to repair the fence. When the party _aggrieved_, has repaired\r\nthe the fence, in obedience to the order of the two justices, the\r\nfence viewers, who by the law are the _sole judges_ of the charge to\r\nbe borne by the delinquent, must be called upon to fix the amount\r\nof compensation, to be reimbursed by the delinquent, for which sum,\r\ntogether with costs, the justices are required to issue a warrant\r\nagainst him to be levied upon his goods and chattels.\r\n\r\nIf the viewers and the two justices have in all respects conformed to\r\nthe law, and have kept _within_ their jurisdiction, the facts cannot\r\n_now_ be controverted. What are the facts in this case?\r\n\r\nThe viewers have been legally summoned to view and examine a fence\r\nwhich separates the lands of the complainant's from the land of the\r\ndefendants. They say they were called to view a _partition fence_\r\nbetween the said parties, and that on such examination, they found the\r\ndefendant's part to be deficient, or not lawful, and that they directed\r\nhim to make a good and sufficient fence _on the line_ within ten days.\r\nThis order of the viewers is dated 21st January, 1815.\r\n\r\nThe defendants having neglected to repair the fence for _more_ than\r\nten days, the complainants did according to law, apply to two justices\r\nfor an order to be issued to him to repair the fence, which order, the\r\nsaid justices, after being satisfied by due proof, that the defendant\r\nhad neglected to repair the fence, for ten days, did issue on the 26th\r\nAugust, 1815.--To this order the complainants have returned to the\r\njustices that they have complied therewith and repaired the fence.\r\n\r\nAs far as the proceedings have gone, every thing has been done\r\nagreeable to the law.\r\n\r\nFour exceptions however have been filed by the defendant. The first and\r\nsecond objections may be comprised in one, and present a difficulty\r\nof a legal nature, that the complainants represent a corporate body,\r\nand are therefore not included in the law that relates to fences.--If\r\nthis objection were well founded, its operation would be conclusive\r\nin favour of the defendant, because a law that does not bind both\r\nparties in interest, never ought to be carried into execution against\r\n_either_.--In our opinion, however, the law in the case before us\r\nincludes _corporate bodies_, as well as natural persons. The statute\r\n22. H. 8. ch. 5. for the repair of bridges which subjects to taxation,\r\nthe _inhabitants_ of every Shire, Riding, City, or Town, and for\r\nnon-payment of which their goods may be seized and sold, has been\r\nuniversally acknowledged and held to include _Corporations_. 2 inst.\r\n703. comp. 79. Sir T. Jones 167.\r\n\r\nThe word _Inhabitants_, says Sir Edward Coke, is the largest word of\r\nthe kind, and includes every corporation or Body Politic, residing in\r\nany County, Riding, City or Town. To these authorities we shall only\r\nadd, that in 2 Bac. Abr. Wilson's Edition, page 10, it is expressly\r\nlaid down, that _Corporations_ in the character of _owners_ or\r\n_occupiers_ of houses or lands, are subject to the same burden to which\r\n_individuals_ are subject, in the same character.\r\n\r\nThe good sense of these decisions, must strike every body, as their\r\ntendency is to place natural and artificial bodies on the same footing.\r\n\r\nThe third exception filed by the defendant, viz: that the two justices\r\nordered the complainants to put up the fence, _without_ requiring proof\r\nthat the defendant had _not_ complied with the order of the viewers,\r\nis destitute of foundation. The record of the justices show that this\r\nexception is founded in mistake.\r\n\r\nThe fourth exception is, that the viewers had no authority to order the\r\ndefendant to put up and repair his fence _on the line_.\r\n\r\nIt is certain they could not order him to put it up or repair it _off\r\nthe line_; and having directed him to repair it _on the line_, cannot\r\ninvalidate the order. Viewing the words, _on the line_, in the most\r\nexceptionable light, they can be deemed nothing but surplusage. The\r\nsubstantial drift of the order is, that the defendant shall repair the\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the affidavit of the defendant of the 6th of January,\r\n1816, that he has enclosed completely the burial ground on his _own_\r\nground, leaving an interval of 10 feet between the line of the burial\r\nground and the fence he has put up, the Court would remark, that\r\ngenerally speaking, a man has a right to put up a fence upon his own\r\nland, and as many as he pleases. A man must however so exercise his\r\nright, as not to injure those of another. Having once joined fences\r\nwith his neighbours he cannot, when ordered to repair his share of\r\nit, evade the law, by removing it, and placing it altogether upon his\r\n_own_ ground. Where the law has once laid its hands upon a man, he\r\nmust not be allowed to escape from its operation. Nothing can meet the\r\napprobation of a Court, that would look like an evasion of the law. A\r\nman cannot in one and the same breath, say he is bound and not bound.\r\nWhether a person might remove his share of a _division fence_ and\r\nplace it upon his _own_ ground, prior to an inspection by the fence\r\nviewers, is a point not now before the Court. But we are very clearly\r\nof opinion, removing a fence _after_ it had been repaired in obedience\r\nto the order of two Justices, cannot exempt him from the operation of\r\nthe law.\r\n\r\nThere being no error in point of law in the proceedings removed, the\r\njudgment of the Court is, they must be confirmed.\r\n\r\n                                             [_Poulson's Am. daily Adv._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modes of salutation._--From the form of salutations among different\r\nnations we may learn something of their character, at least of their\r\nmanners. In the southern provinces of China the common people ask \"Ya\r\nTan,\" that is, How have you eaten your rice; for in that is their\r\ngreatest felicity. If two Dutchmen meet in the morning they wish each\r\nother good appetite. \"Smaakelyk leten.\" In Cairo the inhabitants ask\r\nhow do you sweat? for the not sweating is the symptom of an approaching\r\nfever. The Italian and Spaniard ask How does it stand? \"Come sta.\" The\r\nFrenchman, How do you carry yourself? \"Comment vous portez vous?\" The\r\nGerman, How do you find yourself? \"Wie befinden sie sich.\" The English,\r\n\"How do you do?\" The Dutchman says, How fare you. \"Hau vaart uwe.\"\r\nThere is one nation (we forget which) which ask \"How do you live,\" and\r\nthese are certainly the most wise of all.\r\n\r\n_To make starch._--To make starch from wheat, the grain is steeped\r\nin cold water until it becomes soft and yields a milky juice by\r\npressure; it is then put into sacks of linen, and pressed in a vat\r\nfilled with cold water; as long as any milky juice exudes, the pressure\r\nis continued; the fluid gradually becomes clear, and a white powder\r\nsubsides, which is starch.\r\n\r\n_Chestnut wood_ has recently been successfully applied to the purpose\r\nof dyeing and tanning, thus forming a substitute for log-wood, and\r\noak bark. Leather tanned by it, is declared by the gentleman who made\r\nthe experiments, to be superior to that tanned with oak bark; and in\r\ndyeing, its affinity for wool is said, on the same authority, to be\r\ngreater than that of either galls or sumac, and consequently the colour\r\ngiven more permanent. It also makes admirable ink.\r\n\r\n_The ants of Valencia._--M. Humboldt informs, that ants abound to such\r\na degree near Valencia, that their excavations resemble subterraneous\r\ncanals, which are filled with water in the time of the rains, and\r\nbecome very dangerous to the buildings.\r\n\r\nMr. Heathfield has published a pamphlet, in England, proposing to pay\r\noff one half of the national debt, by an assessment of 15 per cent.\r\non the capital of all property in the kingdom. The Courier says the\r\nproject \"is wise, necessary, and will be effectual,\" and permit the\r\nrepeal of twenty millions of taxes.\r\n\r\n_Longitude._--La Baronne De Paris Boisrowvray, has arrived in England\r\nfrom Paris, charged with a commission to present to the Admiralty\r\nBoard, a theory of the compass, which gives the longitude and latitude\r\nof the globe, for the discovery of which the whole world has so long\r\nlooked. The husband of this lady has submitted his theory to the\r\nAcademy at Paris. His wife's mission to London was to prevent delay, as\r\nwell as to have a trustworthy agent.\r\n\r\n_Indian Jurisprudence._--The Cherokees, it is said, have established\r\nsomething like a judiciary system, and introduced into their society\r\nmany of the laws and usages of civilization. Some of their savage\r\ninstitutions are disappearing, under the ameliorating influence of\r\nmoral justice. As a specimen of the manner in which they dispense\r\njustice in cases of trivial import, we relate the following anecdote,\r\nsaid to be authentic:\r\n\r\nAn Indian assaulted another, of which regular information was made.\r\nThe judge ordered the sheriff to bring the parties before him. The\r\nsheriff went in pursuit of them, but returned without them. \"Where\r\nare your prisoners?\" said the judge. \"I caught them,\" replied the\r\nsheriff,--\"What did you do with them?\" \"I gave the defendant fifteen\r\nlashes.\" \"What did you do with the plaintiff?\" \"Gave him fifteen too.\"\r\n\"What with the informer or witness?\" \"Why I gave him twenty-five\r\nlashes--for, had he held his tongue, there would have been none of this\r\nfuss and trouble.\" It would be well if all the dispensations of justice\r\ncould be so equally and promptly administered.\r\n\r\n                                                     [_Savannah Museum._\r\n\r\n_Preservation of Water at Sea._--M. Pernet, after an examination of\r\nthe means which are, or may be adopted for the preservation of fresh\r\nwater at sea, gives the preference to the following: 1½ parts of oxide\r\nof manganese in powder is mixed with 250 parts of water, and agitated\r\nevery fifteen days. In this way water has been preserved unchanged for\r\nseven years.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Annales de Chimie observes, that oxide of manganese\r\nhas the power, not only of preserving water, but of rendering that\r\nsweet which has become putrid; but he also points out the important\r\ncircumstance, that the oxide is slightly soluble in water, and\r\ntherefore recommends the use of iron tanks for the water, as in England.\r\n\r\n_A species of limestone_ has been discovered in working the canal\r\nthrough the state of New York, and since in many parts of the country,\r\nso well adapted for water cement as to supercede the necessity\r\nof importing, as heretofore done, at great expense the principal\r\ningredient of hydraulic mortar.\r\n\r\n_Charleston, January 27._--We have seen a specimen of white marble,\r\nrecently discovered in Spartenburg district, about five miles from\r\nBroad river. It is acknowledged to be very superior; and its grain is\r\nsaid to surpass that of the Italian marble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIED,\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Charleston, (S.
