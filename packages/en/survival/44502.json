For the most part the scientific delvers whose efforts have\r\nheld our attention have been tacitly unmindful, or even explicitly\r\ncontemptuous, of the influence upon practical life of the phenomena to\r\nthe investigation of which they have devoted their lives. They were and\r\nare obviously seekers of truth for the mere love of truth.\r\n\r\nBut the phenomena of nature are not dissociated in fact, however\r\nmuch we may attempt to localize and classify them. And so it chances\r\nthat even the most visionary devotee of abstract science is forever\r\nbeing carried into fields of investigation trenching closely upon the\r\npracticalities of every-day life. A Black investigating the laws of\r\nheat is preparing the way explicitly, however unconsciously, for a Watt\r\nwith his perfected mechanism of the steam engine.\r\n\r\nSimilarly a Davy working at the Royal Institution with his newly\r\ninvented batteries, and intent on the discovery of new elements and the\r\nelucidation of new principles, is the direct forerunner of Jablochkoff,\r\nBrush, and Edison with their commercial revolution in the production of\r\nartificial light.\r\n\r\nAgain Oersted and Faraday, earnestly seeking out the fundamental facts\r\nas to the relations of electricity and magnetism, invent mechanisms\r\nwhich, though they seem but laboratory toys, are the direct forerunners\r\nof the modern dynamos that take so large a share in the world's work.\r\n\r\nIn a word, all along the line there is the closest association\r\nbetween what are commonly called the theoretical sciences and what\r\nwith only partial propriety are termed the applied sciences. The\r\nlinkage of one with the other must never be forgotten by anyone who\r\nwould truly apprehend the status of those practical sciences which\r\nhave revolutionized the civilization of the nineteenth and twentieth\r\ncenturies in its most manifest aspects.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there is, to casual inspection, a somewhat radical\r\ndistinction between theoretical and practical aspects of science--just\r\nas there are obvious differences between two sides of a shield.\r\nAnd as the theoretical aspects of science have largely claimed our\r\nattention hitherto, so its practical aspects will be explicitly\r\nput forward in the pages that follow. In the present volume we are\r\nconcerned with those primitive applications of force through which\r\nman early learned to add to his working efficiency, and with the\r\nelaborate mechanisms--turbine wheels, steam engines, dynamos--through\r\nwhich he has been enabled to multiply his powers until it is scarcely\r\nexaggeration to say that he has made all Nature subservient to his\r\nwill. It is this view which justifies the title of the volume, which\r\nmight with equal propriety have been termed the Story of the World's\r\nWork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF NATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nMAN AND NATURE\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Young men,\" said a wise physician in addressing a class of graduates\r\nin medicine, \"you are about to enter the battle of life. Note that I\r\nsay the 'battle' of life. Not a playground, but a battlefield is before\r\nyou. It is a hard contest--a battle royal. Make no mistake as to that.\r\nYour studies here have furnished your equipment; now you must go forth\r\neach to fight for himself.\"\r\n\r\nThe same words might be said to every neophyte in whatever walk of\r\nlife. The pursuit of every trade, every profession is a battle--a\r\nstruggle for existence and for supremacy. Partly it is a battle against\r\nfellow men; partly against the contending powers of Nature. The\r\nphysician meets rivalry from his brothers; but his chief battle is with\r\ndisease. In the creative and manufacturing fields which will chiefly\r\nconcern us in the following volumes, it is the powers of Nature that\r\nfurnish an ever-present antagonism.\r\n\r\nNo stone can be lifted above another, to make the crudest wall or\r\ndwelling, but Nature--represented by her power of gravitation--strives\r\nat once to pull it down again. No structure is completed before the\r\nelements are at work defacing it, preparing its slow but certain ruin.\r\nSummer heat and winter cold expand and contract materials of every\r\nkind; rain and wind wear and warp and twist; the oxygen of the air\r\ngnaws into stone and iron alike;--in a word, all the elements are at\r\nwork undoing what man has accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE\r\n\r\nIn the field of the agriculturist it is the same story. The earth which\r\nbrings forth its crop of unwholesome weeds so bountifully, resists\r\nman's approaches when he strives to bring it under cultivation. Only by\r\nthe most careful attention can useful grains be made to grow where the\r\nwildlings swarmed in profusion. Not only do wind and rain, blighting\r\nheat and withering cold menace the crops; but weeds invade the fields,\r\nthe germs of fungoid pests lurk everywhere; and myriad insects attack\r\norchard and meadow and grain field in devastating legions.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the beasts which were so rugged and resistant while in\r\nthe wild state, become tender and susceptible to disease when made\r\nuseful by domestication. Aforetime they roamed at large, braving every\r\ntemperature and thriving in all weathers. But now they must be housed\r\nand cared for so tenderly that they become, as Thoreau said, the\r\nkeepers of men, rather than kept by men, so much more independent are\r\nthey than their alleged owners. Tender of constitution, domesticated\r\nbeasts must be housed, to protect them from the blasts in which of yore\r\ntheir forebears revelled; and man must slave day in and day out to\r\nprepare food to meet the requirements of their pampered appetites.\r\n\r\nHe must struggle, too, to protect them from disease, and must care for\r\nthem in time of illness as sedulously as he cares for his own kith and\r\nkin. Truly the ox is keeper of the man, and the seeming conquest that\r\nman has wrought has cost him dear.\r\n\r\nBut of course the story has another side. After all, Nature is not so\r\nmalevolent as at first glance she seems. She has opposed man at every\r\nstage of his attempted progress; yet at the same time she has supplied\r\nhim all his weapons for waging war upon her. Her great power of\r\ngravitation opposes every effort he makes; yet without that same power\r\nhe could do nothing--he could not walk or stay upon the earth even; and\r\nno structure that he builds would hold in place for an instant.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the wind that smites him and tears at his handiwork, may be\r\nmade to serve the purposes of turning his windmills and supplying him\r\nwith power.\r\n\r\nThe water will serve a like purpose in turning his mills; and, changed\r\nto steam with the aid of Nature's store of coal, will make his steam\r\nengines and dynamos possible. Even the lightning he will harness and\r\nmake subject to his will in the telegraphic currents and dynamos.\r\n\r\nAnd in the fields, the grains which man struggles so arduously to\r\nproduce are after all no thing of his creating. They are only adopted\r\nproducts of Nature, which he has striven to make serve his purpose by\r\ngrowing them under artificial conditions. So, too, the domesticated\r\nbeasts are creatures that belong in the wilds and in distant lands. Man\r\nhas brought them, in defiance of Nature, to uncongenial climes, and\r\nmade them serve as workers and as food-suppliers where Nature alone\r\ncould not support them. Turn loose the cow and the horse to forage for\r\nthemselves here in the inhospitable north, and they would starve. They\r\nsurvive because man helps them to combat the adverse conditions imposed\r\nby Nature, yet no one of them could live for an hour were not the vital\r\ncapacities supplied by Nature still in control.\r\n\r\nEverywhere, then, it is the opposing of Nature, up to certain limits,\r\nwith the aid of Nature's own tools, that constitutes man's work in the\r\nworld. Just in proportion as he bends the elements to meet his needs,\r\ntransforms the plants and animals, defies and exceeds the limitations\r\nof primeval Nature--just in proportion as he conquers Nature, in a\r\nword, is he civilized.\r\n\r\nBarbaric man is called a child of Nature with full reason. He must\r\naccept what Nature offers. But civilized man is the child grown to\r\nadult stature, and able in a manner to control, to dominate--if you\r\nplease to conquer--the parent.\r\n\r\nIf we were to seek the means by which developing man has gradually\r\nachieved this conquest, we should find it in the single word, Tools;\r\nthat is to say, machines for utilizing the powers of Nature, and, as\r\nit were, multiplying them for man's benefit. So unique is the capacity\r\nthat man exerts in this direction, that he has been described as\r\n\"the tool-making animal.\" The description is absolutely accurate; it\r\nis inclusive and exclusive. No non-human animal makes any form of\r\nimplement to aid it in performing its daily work; and contrariwise\r\nevery human tribe, however low its stage of savagery, makes use of more\r\nor less crude forms of implements. There must have been a time, to be\r\nsure, when there existed a man so low in intelligence that he had not\r\nput into execution the idea of making even the simplest tool. But the\r\nperiod when such a man existed so vastly antedates all records that it\r\nneed not here concern us. For the purpose of classifying all existing\r\nmen, and all the tribes of men of which history and pre-historic\r\narchæology give us any record, the definition of man as the tool-making\r\nanimal is accurate and sufficient.\r\n\r\nAt first thought it might seem that an equally comprehensive definition\r\nmight describe man as the working animal. But a moment's consideration\r\nshows the fallacy of such a suggestion. Man is, to be sure, the animal\r\nthat works effectively, thanks to the implements with which he has\r\nlearned to provide himself; but he shares with all animate creatures\r\nthe task of laboring for his daily necessities. This is indeed a\r\nwork-a-day world, and no creature can live in it without taking\r\nits share in that perpetual conflict which bodily necessities make\r\nimperative. Most lower animals confine their work to the mere securing\r\nof food, and to the construction of rude habitations. Some, indeed,\r\ngo a step farther and lay up stores of food, in chance burrows or\r\nhollow trees; a few even manufacture relatively artistic and highly\r\neffective receptacles, as illustrated by the honeycomb made by the\r\nbees and their allies. Again, certain animals, of which the birds\r\nare the best representatives, construct temporary structures for the\r\npurpose of rearing their young that attain a relatively high degree of\r\nartistic perfection. The Baltimore oriole weaves a cloth of vegetable\r\nfibre that is certainly a wonderful texture to be made with the aid of\r\nclaws and bill alone. It may be doubted whether human hands, unaided by\r\nimplements, could duplicate it. But it is crude enough compared with\r\neven the coarsest cloth which barbaric races manufacture with the aid\r\nof implements.\r\n\r\nSo it is with any comparison of animal work with the work of man, in\r\nwhatever field. The crudest human endeavor is superior to the best\r\nnon-human efforts; and the explanation is found always in the fact that\r\nthe ingenuity of man has enabled him to find artificial aids that add\r\nto his power of manipulation. So large a share have these artificial\r\naids taken in man's evolution, that it has long been customary, in\r\nstudying the development of civilization, to make the use of various\r\ntypes of implements a test of varying stages of human progress.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\nThe student of primitive life assures us, basing his statements on the\r\narchæological records, that there was a time when the most advanced of\r\nmankind had no tools made of better material than chipped stone. By\r\ncommon consent that time is spoken of as the Rough Stone Age.\r\n\r\nWe are told that then in the course of immeasurable centuries man\r\nlearned to polish his stone implements, doubtless by rubbing them\r\nagainst another stone, or perhaps with the aid of sand, thus producing\r\na new type of implement which has given its name to the Age of Smooth\r\nor Polished Stone.\r\n\r\nThen after other long centuries came a time when man had learned\r\nto smelt the softer metals, and the new civilization which now\r\nsupplanted the old, and, thanks to the new implements, advanced upon it\r\nimmeasurably, is called the Age of Bronze.\r\n\r\nAt last man learned to accomplish the wonderful feat of smelting the\r\nintractable metal, iron, and in so doing produced implements harder,\r\nsharper, and cheaper than his implements of bronze; and when this\r\ncrowning feat had been accomplished, the Age of Iron was ushered in.\r\n\r\nBy common consent, students of the history of the evolution of society\r\naccept these successive ages, each designated by the type of implements\r\nwith which the world's work was accomplished, as representing real and\r\ndefinite stages of human progress, and as needing no better definition\r\nthan that supplied by the different types of implements.\r\n\r\nCould the archæologist trace the stream of human progress still farther\r\nback toward its source, he would find doubtless that there were several\r\ngreat epochal inventions preceding the time of the Rough Stone Age,\r\neach of which was in its way as definitive and as revolutionary in\r\nits effects upon society, as these later inventions which we have just\r\nnamed. To attempt to define them clearly is to enter the field of\r\nuncertainty, but two or three conjectures may be hazarded that cannot\r\nbe very wide of the truth.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, for example, that if we go back in imagination to the very\r\nremotest ancestors of man that can be called human, we must suppose a\r\nvast and revolutionary stage of progress to have been ushered in by the\r\nfirst race of men that learned to make habitual use of the simplest\r\nimplement, such as a mere club. When man had learned to wield a club\r\nand to throw a stone, and to use a stone held in the hand to break the\r\nshell of a nut, he had attained a stage of culture which augured great\r\nthings for the future. Out of the idea of wielded club and hurled stone\r\nwere to grow in time the ideas of hammer and axe and spear and arrow.\r\n\r\nThen there came a time--no one dare guess how many thousands of years\r\nlater--when man learned to cover his body with the skin of an animal,\r\nand thus to become in a measure freed from the thraldom of the weather.\r\nHe completed his enfranchisement by learning to avail himself of the\r\nheat provided by an artificial fire. Equipped with these two marvelous\r\ninventions he was able to extend the hitherto narrow bounds of his\r\ndwelling-place, passing northward to the regions which at an earlier\r\nstage of his development he dared not penetrate. Under stress of more\r\nexhilarating climatic conditions, he developed new ideals and learned\r\nto overcome new difficulties; developing both a material civilization\r\nand the advanced mentality that is its counterpart, as he doubtless\r\nnever would have done had he remained subject to the more pampering\r\nconditions of the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe most important, perhaps, of the new things which he was taught\r\nby the seemingly adverse conditions of an inhospitable climate, was\r\nto provide for the needs of a wandering life and of varying seasons\r\nby domesticating animals that could afford him an ever-present food\r\nsupply. In so doing he ceased to be a mere fisher and hunter, and\r\nbecame a herdsman. One other step, and he had conceived the idea of\r\nproviding for himself a supply of vegetable foods, to take the place\r\nof that which nature had provided so bountifully in his old home in\r\nthe tropics. When this idea was put into execution man became an\r\nagriculturist, and had entered upon the high road to civilization.\r\n\r\nAll these stages of progress had been entered upon prior to the time of\r\nwhich the oldest known remains of the cave-dweller give us knowledge.\r\nIt were idle to conjecture the precise sequence in which these earliest\r\nsteps toward civilization were taken, and even more idle to conjecture\r\nthe length of time which elapsed between one step and its successor.\r\nBut all questions of precise sequence aside, it is clear that here were\r\nfour or five great ages succeeding one to another, that marked the\r\nonward and upward progress of our primeval ancestor before he achieved\r\nthe stage of development that enabled him to leave permanent records of\r\nhis existence. And--what is particularly significant from our present\r\nstandpoint--it is equally clear that each of the great ages thus\r\nvaguely outlined was dependent upon an achievement or an invention\r\nthat facilitated the carrying out of that scheme of never-ending work\r\nwhich from first to last has been man's portion. How to labor more\r\nefficiently, more productively; how to produce more of the necessaries\r\nand of the luxuries that man's physical and mental being demands,\r\nwith less expenditure of toil--that from first to last has been the\r\never-insistent problem. And the answer has been found always through\r\nthe development of some new species of mechanism, some new labor-saving\r\ndevice, some ingenious manipulation of the powers of Nature.\r\n\r\nIf, turning from the hypothetical period of our primitive ancestor,\r\nwe consider the sweep of secure and relatively recent history, we\r\nshall find that precisely the same thing holds. If we contrast the\r\ncivilization of Old Egypt and Babylonia--the oldest civilizations of\r\nwhich we have any secure record--with the civilization of to-day, we\r\nshall find that the differences between the one and the other are such\r\nas are due to new and improved methods of accomplishing the world's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIndeed, if we view the subject carefully, it will become more and\r\nmore evident that the only real progress that the historic period has\r\nto show is such as has grown directly from the development of new\r\nmechanical inventions. The more we study the ancient civilizations\r\nthe more we shall be struck with their marvelous resemblance, as\r\nregards mental life, to the civilization of to-day. In their moral\r\nand spiritual ideals, the ancient Egyptians were as brothers to the\r\nmodern Europeans. In philosophy, in art, in literature, the Age of\r\nPericles established standards that still remain unexcelled. In all the\r\nsubtleties of thought, we feel that the Greeks had reached intellectual\r\nbounds that we have not been able to extend.\r\n\r\nBut when, on the other hand, we consider the material civilization of\r\nthe two epochs, we find contrasts that are altogether startling. The\r\nlittle world of the Greeks nestled about the Mediterranean, bounded\r\non every side at a distance of a few hundred leagues by a _terra\r\nincognita_. The philosophers who had reached the confines of the\r\nfield of thought, had but the narrowest knowledge of the geography of\r\nour globe. They traversed at best a few petty miles of its surface\r\non foot or in carts; and they navigated the Mediterranean Sea, or at\r\nmost coasted out a little way beyond the Pillars of Hercules in boats\r\nchiefly propelled by oars. By dint of great industry they produced a\r\nreally astonishing number of books, but the production of each one was\r\na long and laborious task, and the aggregate number indited during\r\nthe Age of Pericles in all the world was perhaps not greater than an\r\nafternoon's output of a modern printing press.\r\n\r\nIn a word, these men of the classical period of antiquity, great as\r\nwere their mental, artistic, and moral achievements, were as children\r\nin those matters of practical mechanics upon which the outward\r\nevidences of civilization depend. Should we find a race of people\r\nto-day in some hitherto unexplored portion of the earth--did such\r\nunexplored portions still exist--living a life comparable to that\r\nof the Age of Pericles, we should marvel no doubt at their artistic\r\nachievements, while at the same time regarding them as scarcely better\r\nthan barbarians. Indeed this is more than unsupported hypothesis;\r\nfor has it not been difficult for the Western world to admit the\r\ntruly civilized condition of the Chinese, simply because that highly\r\nintellectual race of Orientals has not kept abreast of the Occidental\r\nchanges in applied mechanics? Say what we will, this is the standard\r\nwhich we of the Western world apply as the test of civilization.\r\n\r\nIf, sweeping over in retrospect the history of the world since the time\r\nwhen the Egyptian and Babylonian civilizations were at their height,\r\nwe attempt some such classification of the stages of progress as that\r\nwhich we a moment ago applied to pre-historic times, we shall be led to\r\nsome rather startling conclusions. In the broadest view, it will appear\r\nthat the age which ushered in the historic period continued unbroken\r\nby the advance of any great revolutionary invention throughout the\r\nlong centuries of pre-Christian antiquity, and well into the so-called\r\nMiddle Ages of our newer era. Then came the invention of gunpowder, or\r\nat least its introduction to the Western world--since the Chinaman here\r\nlays claim to vague centuries of precedence. Following hard upon the\r\nintroduction of gunpowder, with its capacity to add to the destructive\r\nefficiency of man's most sinister form of labor, came a mechanism no\r\nless epoch-making in a far different field--the printing press.\r\n\r\nBut even these inventions, great as was their influence upon the\r\nprogress of civilization, can scarcely be considered, it seems to me,\r\nas taking rank with the great epochal discoveries that gave their\r\nnames to the preceding ages. Nor can any invention of the sixteenth\r\nor seventeenth century be hailed as really ushering in a new era. The\r\ninvention for which that honor was reserved was a development of the\r\neighteenth century; and did not come fully to its heritage until the\r\nearly days of the nineteenth century. The invention was the application\r\nof steam to the purposes of mechanics. When this application was made,\r\nas wide a gap was crossed as that which separated the Stone Age from\r\nthe Age of Metal; then the epoch in which the world was living when\r\nhistory begins was brought to a close, and a new era, the Age of Steam,\r\nwas ushered in.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the world begun to adjust itself to the new conditions of\r\nthe Age of Steam, when yet another power was made subservient to man's\r\nneeds, and the Age of Steam was supplemented, not to say supplanted, by\r\nthe Age of Electricity. Of course the new progressive movements did not\r\nnecessarily imply elimination of old conditions; they imply merely the\r\nsubordination of old powers to newer and better ones. Stone implements\r\nby no means ceased to have utility at once when metal implements came\r\ninto vogue. Bronze long held its own against iron, and still has its\r\nutility. And iron itself finds but an added sphere of usefulness in the\r\nAge of Steam and Electricity.\r\n\r\nAll great changes are relatively slow. It is only as we look back upon\r\nthem and view them in perspective that they seem cataclysmic. Gunpowder\r\ndid not at once supplant the crossbow, and the cannon was long held\r\nto be inferior to the catapult. The printed book did not instantly\r\nmake its way against the work of the scribe. Neither did the steam\r\nengine immediately supplant water power and the direct application of\r\nhuman labor. But in each case the new invention virtually rang the\r\ndeath knell of the old method from the hour of its inauguration, and\r\nthe end was no less sure because it was delayed. And it requires no\r\ngreat powers of divination to foretell that in the coming age, the\r\nelectric dynamo driven by water power may take the place of the steam\r\nengine. The Age of Steam may pass, with only at most a few generations\r\nof domination. And it is within the possibilities that the Age of\r\nElectricity will scarcely come into its own before it may be displaced\r\nby an Age of Radio-Activity. To press that point, however, would be to\r\nenter the field of prophecy, which is no part of my present purpose.\r\n\r\nAll that I have wished to point out is that for some thousands of\r\nyears after man learned to make implements of iron, the industrial\r\nworld and the human civilization that depends upon it, pursued a\r\nrelatively static course, like a broad, sluggish current, with no\r\nnew revolutionary discovery to impel it into new channels; and that\r\nthen one revolutionary discovery succeeded another with bewildering\r\nsuddenness, so that we of the early days of the twentieth century\r\nare farther removed, in an industrial way, from our forerunners of\r\ntwo hundred years ago, than those children of the eighteenth century\r\nwere from the earliest civilization that ever developed on our globe.\r\nIndeed, this startling contrast would still hold true, were we to\r\nconsider the newest era as compassing only the period of a single\r\nlife. There are men living to-day who were born in that epoch when\r\nthe steam engine was for the first time used to turn the wheels of\r\nfactories. There are many men who can well remember the first practical\r\napplication of steam to railway traffic. Hosts of men can remember when\r\nthe first commercial message was transmitted by electricity along a\r\nwire. Even middle-aged men recall the first cable message that linked\r\nthe old world with the new. And the application of the dynamo to the\r\npurposes of the world's work is an affair of but yesterday.\r\n\r\nThe historian of the future, casting his eye back across the long\r\nperspective of history, will find civilized man pursuing an even and\r\nunbroken course across the ages from the time of the pyramids of Egypt\r\nto about the time of the French Revolution. There will be no dearth\r\nof incident to claim his attention in the way of wars and conquests,\r\nand changing creeds, and the rise and fall of nations, each pursuing\r\nvirtually the same course of growth and decay as all the others. But\r\nwhen he comes to the close of the eighteenth century, it will not be\r\nthe social paroxysm of a nation, or the meteoric career of a Napoleon\r\nthat will claim his attention so much as the introduction of that new\r\nmethod of utilizing the powers of Nature which found its expression in\r\nthe mechanism called the steam engine.\r\n\r\nIf the name of any individual stands out as the great and memorable one\r\nof that epoch of transition, at which the static current of previous\r\ncivilization changed suddenly to a Niagara-current of progress, it will\r\nbe the name of the great scientific inventor, rather than that of the\r\ngreat military conqueror--the name of James Watt, rather than that of\r\nNapoleon.\r\n\r\nThe military conqueror had his day of surpassing glory and departed,\r\nto leave the world only a little worse than he found it. But the\r\nmechanical inventor left a heritage that was to add day by day to the\r\nwealth and happiness of humanity, supplying millions of artificial\r\nhands, and making possible such beneficent improvements as no previous\r\nage had dreamed of. Tasks that human hands had performed slowly,\r\nlaboriously, and inadequately, were now to be performed swiftly, with\r\nease, and well by the artificial hands provided with the aid of the new\r\npower. Where carts drawn by horses had toiled slowly across the land,\r\nand ships driven by the wind had drifted slowly through the waters,\r\nmassive trains of cars were to hurtle to the four corners of the earth\r\nwith inconceivable speed, and floating palaces were to course the\r\nwaters with almost equal defiance to the limitations of time and space.\r\n\r\nAnd then there came that still weirder conquest of time and space,\r\nwrought by the electric current. The moment when man first spoke with\r\nman from continent to continent in defiance of the oceans, marked\r\nthe dawning of that larger day when all mankind shall constitute one\r\nbrotherhood and all peoples but a single nation. Within a half century\r\nthe sun of that new day has risen well above the horizon, and far\r\nsooner than even the optimist of to-day dare predict with certainty, it\r\nseems destined to reach its zenith.\r\n\r\nBut here again we verge upon the dangerous field of prophecy. Let\r\nus turn from it and cast an eye back across the most wonderful of\r\ncenturies, contrasting the conditions of to-day in each of a half-dozen\r\nfields of the world's work, with the conditions that obtained at the\r\nclose of the eighteenth century. Such a brief survey will show us\r\nperhaps more vividly than we could otherwise be shown, how vast has\r\nbeen the progress, how marvelous the development of civilization, in\r\nthe short decades that have elapsed since the coming of the Age of\r\nSteam.\r\n\r\nLet us pay heed first to the world of the agriculturist. Could we\r\nturn back to the days of our grandparents, we should find farming a\r\nvery different employment from what it is to-day. For the most part\r\nthe farmer operated but a few small fields; if he had thirty or forty\r\nacres of ploughed land, he found ample employment for his capacities.\r\nHe ploughed his fields with the aid of either a yoke of oxen or a\r\nteam of horses; he sowed his grain by hand; he cultivated his corn\r\nwith a hoe; he reaped his oats and wheat with a cradle--a device but\r\none step removed from a sickle; he threshed his grain with a flail;\r\nhe ground such portion of it as he needed for his own use with the\r\naid of water power at a neighboring mill; and such portion of it as\r\nhe sold was transported to market, be it far or near, in wagons that\r\ncompassed twenty or thirty miles a day at best. As regards live stock,\r\neach farmer raised a few cattle, sheep, and hogs, and butchered them\r\nto supply his own needs, selling the residue to a local dealer who\r\nsupplied the non-agricultural portion of the neighborhood. Any live\r\nstock intended for a distant market was driven on foot across the\r\ncountry to its destination. Each town and city, therefore, drew almost\r\nexclusively for its supply from the immediately surrounding country.\r\n\r\nTo-day the small farmer has become almost obsolete, and the farms\r\nof the eastern states that were the nation's chief source of supply\r\na century ago are largely allowed to lie fallow, it being no longer\r\npossible to cultivate them profitably in competition with the rich\r\nfarm lands of the middle west. In that new home of agriculture, the\r\nfarm that does not comprise two or three hundred acres is considered\r\nsmall; and large farms are those that number their acres by thousands.\r\nThe soil is turned by steam ploughs; the grain is sown with mechanical\r\nseeders and planters; the corn is cultivated with a horse-drawn\r\nmachine, having blades that do the work of a dozen men; harvesters\r\ndrawn by three or four horses sweep over the fields and leave the grain\r\nmechanically tied in bundles; the steam thresher places the grain in\r\nsacks by hundreds of bushels a day; and this grain is hurried off in\r\nsteam cars to distant mills and yet more distant markets.\r\n\r\nMeantime the raising of live stock has become a special department,\r\nwith which the farmer who deals in cereals often has no concern.\r\nThe cattle roam over vast pastures and are herded in the winter for\r\nfattening in great droves, and protected from the cold in barns\r\nthat, when contrasted with the sheds of the old-time farmer, seem\r\nalmost palatial. When in marketable condition, cattle are no longer\r\nslaughtered at the farm, but are transported in cars to one of the\r\nfew great centres, chief of which are the stock yards of Chicago and\r\nof Kansas City. At these centres, slaughter houses and meat-packing\r\nhouses of stupendous magnitude have been developed, capable of\r\nhandling millions of animals in a year. From these centres the meat is\r\ntransported in refrigerator cars to the seaboards, and in refrigerator\r\nships to all parts of the world. Beef that grew on the ranges of the\r\nfar west may thus be offered for sale in the markets of New England\r\nvillages, at a price that prohibits local competition.\r\n\r\nA more radical metamorphosis in agricultural conditions than all this\r\nimplies could not well be conceived. And when we recall once more that\r\nthe agricultural conditions that obtained at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century were closely similar to those that obtained in each\r\nsuccessive age for a hundred preceding centuries, we shall gain a vivid\r\nidea of the revolutionizing effects of new methods of work in the most\r\nimportant of industries. It is little wonder that in this short time\r\nthe world has not solved to the satisfaction of the economists all the\r\nnew problems thus so suddenly developed.\r\n\r\nTurn now to the manufacturing world. In the days of our\r\ngreat-grandparents almost every household was a miniature factory where\r\ncotton and wool were spun and the products were woven into cloth.\r\nIt was not till toward the close of the eighteenth century--just at\r\nthe time when Watt was perfecting the steam engine--that Arkwright\r\ndeveloped the spinning-frame, and his successors elaborated the\r\nmachinery that made possible the manufacture of cloth in wholesale\r\nquantities; and the nineteenth century was well under way before\r\nthe household production of cloth had been entirely supplanted by\r\nfactory production. It is nothing less than pitiful to contemplate in\r\nimagination our great-great-grandmothers--and all their forebears of\r\nthe long centuries--drudging away day after day, year in and year out,\r\nat the ceaseless task of spinning and weaving--only to produce, as the\r\noutput of a lifetime of labor, a quantity of cloth equivalent perhaps\r\nto what our perfected machine, driven by steam, and manipulated by\r\na factory girl, produces each working hour of every day. Similarly,\r\ncarpets and quilts were of home manufacture; so were coats and dresses;\r\nand shoes were at most the product of the local shoemaker around the\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nIn the kitchen, food was cooked over the coals of a great fireplace\r\nor in the brick oven connected with that fireplace. Meat was supplied\r\nfrom a neighboring farm; eggs were the product of the housewife's own\r\npoultry yard; the son or daughter of the farmer milked the cow and\r\ndrove her to and from the pasture; the milk was \"set\" in pans in the\r\ncellar--on a swinging shelf, preferably, to make it inaccessible to the\r\nrats; and twice a week the cream was made into butter in a primitive\r\nchurn, the dasher of which was operated by the vigorous arm of the\r\nhousewife herself, or by the unwilling arms of some one of her numerous\r\nprogeny.\r\n\r\nTo give variety to the dietary, fruits grown in the local garden\r\nor orchard were preserved, each in its season, by the industrious\r\nhousewife, and stored away in the capacious cellar; where also might be\r\nfound the supply of home-grown potatoes, turnips, carrots, parsnips,\r\nand cabbages to provide for the needs of the winter. Fuel to supply\r\nthe household needs, both for cooking and heating, was cut in the\r\nneighboring woodland, and carefully corded in the door-yard, where it\r\nprovided most uncongenial employment for the youth of the family after\r\nschool hours and of a Saturday afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe ashes produced when this wood was burned in the various fireplaces,\r\nwere not wasted, but were carefully deposited in barrels, from which\r\nin due course lye was extracted by the simple process of pouring water\r\nover the contents of the barrel. Meantime scraps of fat from the table\r\nwere collected throughout the winter and preserved with equal care; and\r\nin due course on some leisure day in the springtime--heaven knows how a\r\nleisure day was ever found in such a scheme of domestic economy!--the\r\nlye drawn from the ash-barrels and the scraps of fat were put into a\r\ngigantic kettle, underneath which a fire was kindled; with the result\r\nthat ultimately a supply of soft soap was provided the housewife, with\r\nwhich her entire establishment, progeny included, could be kept in a\r\nstate of relative cleanness.\r\n\r\nThe reader of these pages has but to cast his eye about him in the\r\nhousehold in which he lives, and contrast the conditions just depicted\r\nwith those of his every-day life, to realize what change has come over\r\nthe aspects of household economy in the course of a short century.\r\nNor need he be told in each of the various departments of which the\r\nactivities are here outlined, that the changes which he observes have\r\nbeen due to the application of machinery in all the essential lines of\r\nwork in question. We need not pause to detail the multitudinous devices\r\nfor the economy of household labor which owe their origin to the same\r\nagency. There still remains, to be sure, enough of drudgery in the task\r\nof the housewife; yet her most strenuous day seems a mere playtime in\r\ncomparison with the average day of her maternal forebear of three or\r\nfour generations ago.\r\n\r\nBut we must not here pause for further outlines of a subject which it\r\nis the purpose of this and succeeding volumes to explicate in detail.\r\nAll our succeeding chapters will but make it more clear how marvelous\r\nare the elaborations of method and of mechanism through which the\r\nworld's work of to-day is accomplished. We shall consider first the\r\nmechanical principles that underlie work in general, passing on to\r\nsome of the principal methods of application through which the powers\r\nof Nature are made available. We shall then take up in succession\r\nthe different fields of industry. We shall ask how the work of the\r\nagriculturist is done in the modern world; how the multitudinous lines\r\nof manufacture are carried out; how transportation is effected; we\r\nshall examine the _modus operandi_ of the transmission of ideas; we\r\nshall even consider that destructive form of labor which manifests\r\nitself in the production of mechanisms of warfare. As we follow out the\r\nstories of the all-essential industries we shall be led to realize more\r\nfully perhaps than we have done before, the meaning of work in its\r\nrelations to human development; and in particular the meaning of modern\r\nwork, as carried out with the aid of modern mechanical contrivances, in\r\nits relations to modern civilization.\r\n\r\nThe full force of these relations may best be permitted to unfold\r\nitself as the story proceeds. There is, however, one fundamental\r\nprinciple which I would ask the reader to bear constantly in mind, as\r\nan aid to the full appreciation of the importance of our subject. It\r\nis that in considering the output of the worker we have constantly to\r\ndo with one form or another of property, and that property is the very\r\nfoundation-stone of civilization. \"It is impossible,\" says Morgan,\r\nin his work on Ancient Society, \"to overestimate the influence of\r\nproperty in the civilization of mankind. It was the power that brought\r\nthe Aryan and Semitic nations out of barbarism into civilization.\r\nThe growth of the idea of property in the human mind commenced in\r\nfeebleness and ended in becoming its master passion. Governments and\r\nlaws are instituted with primary reference to its creation, protection,\r\nand enjoyment. It introduced human slavery in its production; and,\r\nafter the experience of several thousand years, it caused the\r\nabolition of slavery upon the discovery that the freeman was a better\r\nproperty-making machine.\" If, then, we recall that without labor there\r\nis no property, we shall be in an attitude of mind to appreciate the\r\nimportance of our subject; we shall realize, somewhat beyond the bounds\r\nof its more tangible and sordid relations, the essential dignity, the\r\nfundamental importance--in a word, the true meaning--of Work.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly there is a modern tendency to accept this view of the\r\ndignity of physical labor. At any rate, we differ from the savage in\r\nthinking it more fitting that man should toil than that his wife should\r\nlabor to support him--though it cannot be denied that even now the\r\nnumber of physical toilers among women greatly exceeds the number of\r\nsuch toilers among men. But in whatever measure we admit this attitude\r\nof mind, there can be no question that it is exclusively a modern\r\nattitude. Time out of mind, physical labor has been distasteful to\r\nmankind, and it is a later development of philosophy that appreciates\r\nthe beneficence of the task so little relished.\r\n\r\nThe barbarian forces his wife to do most of the work, and glories in\r\nhis own freedom. Early civilization kept conquered foes in thraldom,\r\ndeveloping an hereditary body of slaves, whose function it was to do\r\nthe physical work.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew explained the necessity for labor as a curse imposed upon\r\nFather Adam and Mother Eve. Plato and Aristotle, voicing the spirit of\r\nthe Greeks, considered manual toil as degrading.\r\n\r\nTo-day we hear much of the dignity of labor; but if we would avoid cant\r\nwe must admit that now--scarcely less than in all the olden days--the\r\nphysical toiler is such because he cannot help himself. Few indeed are\r\nthe manual laborers who know any other means of getting their daily\r\nbread than that which they employ. The most strenuous advocates of the\r\nstrenuous life are not themselves tillers of the soil or workers in\r\nfactories or machine shops.\r\n\r\nThe farm youth of intelligence does not remain a farmer; he goes to\r\nthe city, and we find him presently at the head of a railroad or a\r\nbank, or practising law or medicine. The more intelligent laborer\r\nbecomes finally a foreman, and no longer handles the axe or sledge. We\r\nshould think it grotesque were we to see a man of intellectual power\r\nobstinately following a pursuit that cost him habitual physical toil.\r\nWhen now and then a Tolstoi offers an exception to this rule, we feel\r\nthat he is at least eccentric; and we may be excused the doubt whether\r\nhe would follow the manual task cheerfully if he did not know that he\r\ncould at any moment abandon it. It is because he knows that the world\r\nunderstands him to be only a dilettante that he rejoices in his task.\r\n\r\nAfter all, then, judged by the modern practice, rather than by the\r\nphilosopher's precept, the old Hebrew and Greek ideas were not so\r\nfar wrong. Using the poetical language which was so native to them,\r\nit might be said that the necessity for physical labor is a curse--a\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nA partial explanation of this may be found in the fact that the most\r\nuncongenial tasks are also the worst paid, while the congenial tasks\r\ncommand the high emoluments. Generally speaking there is no distinction\r\nbetween one laborer and another in the same field--except where the\r\neminently fair method of piece work can be employed. Even the skilled\r\nlaborer is usually paid by the day, and the amount he is to receive is\r\ncommonly fixed by a Union regardless of his efficiency as compared with\r\nother laborers of the same class. And there is no possibility of his\r\nreceiving any such sums as the man who plans the work, but does nothing\r\nwith his own hands.\r\n\r\nIt has always been so. Just as \"those who think must govern those that\r\ntoil,\" so the thinker must command the high reward. Partly this is\r\nbecause man, considered as a mere toiler, is so relatively inefficient\r\na worker. When he strives to work with his hands, his effort is but a\r\npitiful one; he can by no possibility compete (as regards mere quantity\r\nof labor) with the ox and the horse. He is impatient of his own puerile\r\nefforts. It is only when he brings the products of ingenuity to his\r\naid that he is able to show his superiority, and to justify his own\r\negotism. So it is that in every age he has striven to find means of\r\nadding to his feeble powers of body through the use of his relatively\r\ngigantic powers of mind. And in proportion as he thus is able to \"make\r\nhis head work for his hands\" as the saying goes, he verges toward the\r\nheights of civilization. To accomplish this more and more fully has\r\never been the task of science as applied to the industries.\r\n\r\nIt will be our object in the ensuing chapters to inquire how far\r\nscience has accomplished the protean task thus set for it. We shall see\r\nthat much has been done; but that much still remains to be done. In\r\nproportion as the problems are unsolved, science is reproached for its\r\nshortcomings--and stimulated to new efforts.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as labor has been minimized and production increased--in\r\njust that proportion has science justified itself; and in the same\r\nproportion has the Conquest of Nature been carried toward completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHOW WORK IS DONE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word energy implies capacity to do work. Work, considered in\r\nthe abstract, consists in the moving of particles of matter against\r\nsome opposing force, or in aid of previously acting forces. In the\r\nlast analysis, all energy manifests itself either as a push or as a\r\npull. But there is a modification of push and pull which is familiar\r\nto everyone in practice under the name of prying. Illustrations may\r\nbe seen on every hand, as when a workman pries up a stone, or when\r\na housewife pries up a tack with the aid of a hammer. The principle\r\nhere involved is that of the lever--a principle which in its various\r\npractical modifications is everywhere utilized in mechanics. Very\r\nseldom indeed is the direct push or pull utilized; since the modified\r\npush or pull, as represented by the lever in its various modifications\r\nof pulley, ratchet-wheel, and the like, has long been known to meet the\r\nneeds of practical mechanics.\r\n\r\nThe very earliest primitive man who came to use any implement whatever,\r\nthough it were only a broken stick, must have discovered the essential\r\nprinciple of the lever, though it is hardly necessary to add that he\r\ndid not know his discovery by any such high-sounding title. What he\r\ndid know, from practical experience, was that with the aid of a stick\r\nhe could pry up stones or logs that were much too heavy to be lifted\r\nwithout this aid.\r\n\r\nThis practical knowledge no doubt sufficed for a vast number of\r\ngenerations of men who used the lever habitually, without making\r\nspecific study of the relations between the force expended, the lengths\r\nof the two ends of the lever, and the weight raised. Such specific\r\nexperiments were made, however, more than two thousand years ago by the\r\nfamous Syracusan, Archimedes. He discovered--or if some one else had\r\ndiscovered it before him, he at least recorded and so gains the credit\r\nof discovery--the specific laws of the lever, and he also pointed out\r\nthat levers, all acting on the same principle, may be different as to\r\ntheir practical mechanism in three ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, the fulcrum may lie between the power and the weight, as in the\r\ncase of the balance with which we were just experimenting. This is\r\ncalled a lever of the first class, and familiar illustrations of it are\r\nfurnished by the poker, steelyard, or a pair of scissors. The so-called\r\nextensor muscles of the body--those for example, that cause the arm to\r\nextend--act on the bones in such a way as to make them levers of this\r\nfirst class.\r\n\r\nThe second type of lever is that in which the weight lies between the\r\nforce and the fulcrum, as illustrated by the wheelbarrow, or by an\r\nordinary door.\r\n\r\nIn the third class of levers the power is applied between weight and\r\nfulcrum, as illustrated by a pair of tongs, the treadle of a lathe,\r\nor by the flexor muscles of the arm, operating upon the bones of the\r\nforearm.\r\n\r\nBut in each case, let it be repeated, precisely the same principles are\r\ninvolved, and the same simple law of the relations between positions\r\nof power, weight, and fulcrum are maintained. The practical result\r\nis always that a weight of indefinite size may be moved by a power\r\nindefinitely long. If one arm of the lever is ten times as long as the\r\nother, the power of one pound will lift or balance a ten-pound weight;\r\nif the one arm is a thousand times as long as the other the power of\r\none pound will lift or balance a thousand pounds. If the long arm of\r\nthe lever could be made some millions of miles in length, the power\r\nthat a man could exert would balance the earth.\r\n\r\nHow fully Archimedes realized the possibilities of the lever is\r\nillustrated in the classical remark attributed to him, that, had he\r\nbut a fulcrum on which to place his lever, he could move the world. As\r\notherwise quoted, the remark of Archimedes was that, had he a place\r\non which to stand, he could move the world, a remark which even more\r\nthan the other illustrates the full and acute appreciation of the\r\nlaws of motion; since, as we have already pointed out, action and\r\nreaction being equal, the most infinitesimal push must be considered as\r\ndisturbing even the largest body.\r\n\r\nTremendous as is the pull of gravity by which the earth is held in\r\nits orbit, yet the smallest push, steadily applied from the direction\r\nof the sun, would suffice ultimately to disturb the stability of our\r\nearth's motion, and to push it gradually through a spiral course\r\nfarther and farther away from its present line of elliptical flight.\r\nOr if, on the other hand, the persistent force were applied from the\r\nside opposite the sun, it would suffice ultimately to carry the earth\r\nin a spiral course until it plunged into the sun itself. Indeed it has\r\nbeen questioned in modern times whether it may not be possible that\r\nprecisely this latter effect is gradually being accomplished, through\r\nthe action of meteorites, some millions of which fall out of space into\r\nthe earth's atmosphere every day. If these meteorites were uniformly\r\ndistributed through space and flying in every direction, the fact that\r\nthe sun screens the earth from a certain number of them, would make\r\nthe average number falling on the side away from the sun greater, and\r\nthus would in the course of ages produce the result just suggested. All\r\nthat could save our earth from such a fate would be the operation of\r\nsome counteracting force. Such a counteracting force is perhaps found\r\nin solar radiation. It may be added that the distribution of meteorites\r\nin space is probably too irregular to make their influence on the earth\r\npredicable in the present state of science; but the principle involved\r\nis no less sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEELS AND PULLEYS\r\n\r\nReturning from such theoretical applications of the principle of\r\nmotion, to the practicalities of every-day mechanisms, we must note\r\nsome of the applications through which the principle of the lever is\r\nmade available. Of these some of the most familiar are wheels, and the\r\nvarious modifications of wheels utilized in pulleys and in cogged\r\nand bevelled gearings. A moment's reflection will make it clear that\r\nthe wheel is a lever of the first class, of which the axle constitutes\r\nthe fulcrum. The spokes of the wheel being of equal length, weights\r\nand forces applied to opposite ends of any diameter are, of course,\r\nin equilibrium. It follows that when a wheel is adjusted so that a\r\nrope may be run about it, constituting a simple pulley, a mechanism is\r\ndeveloped which gives no gain in power, but only enables the operator\r\nto change the direction of application of power. In other words, pound\r\nweights at either end of a rope passed about a simple pulley are\r\nin equilibrium and will balance each other, and move through equal\r\ndistances in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSE AND CATTLE POWER.\r\n\r\nThe large picture shows a model of a familiar mechanism for utilizing\r\nhorse power. The small picture shows a similar apparatus in actual\r\noperation, actuated by cattle, in contemporary Brittany.]\r\n\r\nIf, however, two or more pulley wheels are connected, to make the\r\nfamiliar apparatus of a compound pulley, we have accomplished by an\r\ninteresting mechanism a virtual application of the principle of the\r\nlong and short arm of the lever, and the relations between the weight\r\nat the loose end of the rope and the weight attached to the block\r\nwhich constitutes virtually the short end of the lever, may be varied\r\nindefinitely, according to the number of pulley-wheels that are used.\r\nA pound weight may be made to balance a thousand-pound weight; but,\r\nof course, our familiar principle still holding, the pound weight\r\nmust move through a distance of a thousand feet in order to move\r\na thousand-pound weight through a distance of one foot. Familiar\r\nillustrations of the application of this principle may be seen on every\r\nhand; as when, for example, a piano or a safe is raised to the upper\r\nwindow of a building by the efforts of men whose power, if directly\r\nexpended, would be altogether inefficient to stir the weight.\r\n\r\nThe pulley was doubtless invented at a much later stage of human\r\nprogress than the simple lever. It was, however, well known to the\r\nancients. It was probably brought to its highest state of practical\r\nperfection by Archimedes, whose experiments are famous through the\r\nnarrative of Plutarch. It will be recalled that Archimedes amazed\r\nthe Syracusan general by constructing an apparatus that enabled\r\nhim, sitting on shore, to drag a ponderous galley from the water.\r\nPlutarch does not describe in detail the apparatus with which this\r\nwas accomplished, but it is obvious from his description of what took\r\nplace, that it must have been a system of pulleys.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the pulley is a mechanism that enables the\r\nuser to transmit power to a distance. But this indeed is true in a\r\ncertain sense of every form of lever. Numberless other contrivances\r\nare in use by which power is transmitted, through utilization of the\r\nsame principle of the lever, either through a short or through a\r\nrelatively long distance. A familiar illustration is the windlass,\r\nwhich consists of a cylinder rotating on an axis propelled by a long\r\nhandle, a rope being wound about the cylinder. This is a lever of\r\nthe second class, the axis acting as fulcrum, and the rope operating\r\nabout the circumference of the cylinder typifying the weight, which\r\nmay be actually at a considerable distance, as in the case of the\r\nold-fashioned well with its windlass and bucket, or of the simple form\r\nof derrick sometimes called a sheerlegs.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER MEANS OF TRANSMITTING POWER\r\n\r\nPower is transmitted directly from one part of a machine to another,\r\nin the case of a great variety of machines, with the aid of cogged\r\ngearing wheels of various sizes. The modifications of detail in the\r\napplication of these wheels may be almost infinite, but the principle\r\ninvolved is always the same. The case of two wheels toothed about\r\nthe circumference, the teeth of the two wheels fitting into one\r\nanother, illustrates the principle involved. A consideration of the\r\nmechanism will show that here we have virtually a lever fixed at both\r\nends, represented by the radii of the two wheels, the power being\r\napplied through the axle of one wheel, and the weight, for purposes\r\nof calculation, being represented by the pressure of the teeth of one\r\nwheel upon those of the other. So this becomes a lever of the second\r\nclass, and the relations of power between the two wheels are easily\r\ncalculated from the relative lengths of the radii. If, for example,\r\none radius is twice as long as the other, the transmission of power\r\nwill be, obviously, in the proportion of two to one, and meantime the\r\ndistance traversed by the circumference of one wheel will be twice as\r\ngreat as that traversed by the other.\r\n\r\nA modification of the toothed wheel is furnished by wheels which may be\r\nseparated by a considerable distance, and the circumferences of which\r\nare connected by a belt or by a chain. The principle of action here\r\nis precisely the same, the belt or chain serving merely as a means of\r\nlengthening out our lever. The relative sizes of the wheels, and not\r\nthe length of the belt or chain, is the determining factor as regards\r\nthe relative forces required to make the wheels revolve.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious all along, of course, since action and reaction\r\nare equal, that all of the relations in question are reciprocal.\r\nWhen, for example, we speak of a pound weight on the long end of a\r\nlever balancing a ten-pound weight on the short end, it is equally\r\nappropriate to speak of the ten-pound weight as balancing the one-pound\r\nweight. Similarly, when power is applied to the lever, it may be\r\napplied at either end. Ordinarily, to be sure, the power is applied\r\nat the long end, since the object is to lift the heavy weight; but in\r\ncomplicated machinery it quite as often happens that these conditions\r\nare reversed, and then it becomes desirable to apply strong power to\r\nthe short end of the lever, in order that the relatively small weight\r\nmay be carried through the long distance. In the inter-relations of\r\ngearing wheels, such conditions very frequently obtain, practical ends\r\nbeing met by a series of wheels of different sizes. But the single\r\nrule, already so often outlined, everywhere holds--wherever there is\r\ngain of power there is loss of distance, and we can gain distance only\r\nby losing power. The words gain and loss in this application are in a\r\nsense misnomers, since, as we have already seen, gain and loss are only\r\napparent, but their convenience of application is obvious.\r\n\r\nA familiar case in which there is first loss of speed and gain of\r\npower, and then gain of speed at the expense of power in the same\r\nmechanism, is furnished by the bicycle, where (1) the crank shaft\r\nturns the sprocket wheel that constitutes a lever of the second class\r\nwith gain of power; where (2) power is further augmented through\r\ntransmission from the relatively large sprocket wheel to the small\r\nsprocket of the axle; and where (3) there is great loss of power and\r\ncorresponding gain of speed in transmitting the force from the small\r\nsprocket wheel at the axle to the rubber rim of the bicycle proper,\r\nthis last transmission representing a lever of the third class. The net\r\ngain of speed is tangibly represented by the difference in distance\r\ntraversed by the man's feet in revolving the pedals, and the actual\r\ndistance covered by the bicycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCLINED PLANES AND DERRICKS\r\n\r\nA less obvious application of the principle of reciprocal equivalence\r\nof distance and weight is furnished by the inclined plane, a familiar\r\nmechanism with the aid of which a great gain of power is possible. The\r\ninclined plane, like the lever, has been known from remotest antiquity.\r\nIts utility was probably discovered by almost the earliest builders.\r\nDiodorus Siculus tells us that the great pyramids of Egypt were\r\nconstructed with the aid of inclined planes, based on a foundation of\r\nearth piled about the pyramids. Diodorus, living at a period removed by\r\nsome thousands of years from the day of the building of the pyramids,\r\nmay or may not have voiced and recorded an authentic tradition, but we\r\nmay well believe that the principle of the inclined plane was largely\r\ndrawn upon by the mechanics of old Egypt, as by later peoples.\r\n\r\nThe law of the inclined plane is that in order to establish equilibrium\r\nbetween two weights, the one must be to the other as the height of\r\nthe inclined plane is to its length. The steeper the inclined plane,\r\ntherefore, the less will be the gain in power; a mechanical principle\r\nwhich familiar experience or the simplest experiment will readily\r\ncorroborate.\r\n\r\nIn its elemental form the inclined plane is not used very largely in\r\nmodern machinery, but its modified form of the wedge and the screw have\r\nmore utility. The screw, indeed, which is obviously an inclined plane\r\nadjusted spirally about a cylinder or a cone, is familiar to everyone,\r\nand is constantly utilized in applying power.\r\n\r\nThe crane or derrick furnishes a familiar but relatively elaborate\r\nillustration of a mechanism for the transmission of power, in which\r\nall the various devices hitherto referred to are combined, without the\r\nintroduction of any new principle.\r\n\r\nDerricks have been employed from a very early day. The battering-rams\r\nof the ancient Egyptians and Babylonians, for example, were virtually\r\nderricks; and no doubt the same people used the device in raising\r\nstones to build their temples and city walls, and in putting into\r\nposition such massive sculptures as the obelisks of Egypt and the\r\nmonster graven bulls and lions of Nineveh and Babylon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRANES AND DERRICKS.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure shows a floating derrick, the lower right-hand figure\r\na combined derrick and weighing machine, and the lower left-hand figure\r\na so-called sheerlegs, which is a simple derrick and windlass operated\r\nby hand or by steam power with the aid of compound pulleys.]\r\n\r\nThe modern derrick, made of steel, and operated by steam or\r\nelectricity, capable of lifting tons, yet absolutely obedient to the\r\nhand of the engineer, is a really wonderful piece of mechanism. A\r\nsteam-scoop, for example, excavating a gravel bank, seems almost\r\na thing of intelligence; as it gores into the bank scooping up\r\nperhaps a half ton of earth, its upward sweeping head reminds one of\r\nan angry bull. Then as it swings leisurely about and discharges its\r\nload at just the right spot into an awaiting car, its hinged bottom\r\nswings back and forth two or three times before closing, with curious\r\nresemblance to the jaw of a dog; the similarity being heightened\r\nby the square bull-dog-headed shape of the scoop itself. Yet this\r\nremarkable contrivance, with all its massive steel beams and chains\r\nand cog wheels, employs no other principles than the simple ones of\r\nlever and pulley and inclined plane that we have just examined. The\r\npower that must be applied to produce a given effect may be calculated\r\nto a nicety. The capacities of the machine are fully predetermined\r\nin advance of its actual construction. But of course this is equally\r\ntrue of every other form of power-transmitter with which the modern\r\nmechanical engineer has to deal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRICTION\r\n\r\nIn making such calculations, however, there is an additional element\r\nwhich the engineer must consider, but which we have hitherto\r\ndisregarded. In all methods of transmission of power, and indeed in all\r\ncases of the contact of one substance with another, there is an element\r\nof loss through friction. This is due to the fact that no substance\r\nis smooth except in a relative sense. Even the most highly polished\r\nglass or steel, when viewed under the microscope, presents a surface\r\ncovered with indentations and rugosities. This granular surface of\r\neven seemingly smooth objects, is easily visualized through the analogy\r\nof numberless substances that are visibly rough. Yet the vast practical\r\nimportance of this roughness is seldom considered by the casual\r\nobserver. In point of fact, were it not for the roughened surface of\r\nall materials with which we come in contact, it would be impossible for\r\nany animal or man to walk, nor could we hold anything in our hands.\r\nAnyone who has attempted to handle a fish, particularly an eel, fresh\r\nfrom the water, will recall the difficulty with which its slippery\r\nsurface was held; but it may not occur to everyone who has had this\r\nexperience that all other objects would similarly slip from the hand,\r\nhad their surfaces a similar smoothness. The slippery character of the\r\neel is, of course, due in large part to the relatively smooth surface\r\nof its skin, but partly also to the lubricant with which it is covered.\r\nAny substance may be rendered somewhat smoother by proper lubrication;\r\nit is necessary, however, that the lubricant should be something\r\nwhich is not absorbed by the substance. Thus, wood is given increased\r\nfriction by being moistened with oil, but, on the other hand, is made\r\nslippery if covered with graphite, soap, or any other fatty substances\r\nthat it does not absorb.\r\n\r\nRecalling the more or less roughened surface of all objects, the source\r\nof friction is readily understood. It depends upon the actual jutting\r\nof the roughened surfaces, one upon the other. It virtually constitutes\r\na force acting in opposition to the motion of any two surfaces\r\nupon each other. As between any different materials, under given\r\nconditions, it varies with the pressure, in a definite and measurable\r\nrate, which is spoken of as the coefficient of friction for the\r\nparticular substances. It is very much greater where the two substances\r\nslide over one another than where the one rolls upon the other, as in\r\nthe case of the wheel. The latter illustrates what is called rolling\r\nfriction, and in practical mechanics it is used constantly to decrease\r\nthe loss--as, for example, in the wheels of wagons and cars. The use of\r\nlubricants to decrease friction is equally familiar. Without them, as\r\neveryone knows, it would be impossible to run any wheel continuously\r\nupon an axle at high speed for more than a very brief period, owing\r\nto the great heat developed through friction. Friction is indeed a\r\nperpetual antagonist of the mechanician, and we shall see endless\r\nillustrations of the methods he employs to minimize its influence. On\r\nthe other hand, we must recall that were it rendered absolutely _nil_,\r\nhis machinery would all be useless. The car wheel, for example, would\r\nrevolve indefinitely without stirring the train, were there absolutely\r\nno friction between it and the rail.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY\r\n\r\nWe have pointed out that every body whatever contains a certain store\r\nof energy, but it has equally been called to our attention that, in\r\nthe main, these stores of energy are not available for practical use.\r\nThere are, however, various great natural repositories of energy upon\r\nwhich man is able to draw. The chief of these are, first, the muscular\r\nenergy of man himself and of animals; second, the energy of air in\r\nmotion; third, the energy of water in motion or at an elevation; and\r\nfourth, the molecular and atomic energies stored in coal, wood, and\r\nother combustible materials. To these we should probably add the energy\r\nof radio-active substances--a form of energy only recently discovered\r\nand not as yet available on a large scale, but which may sometime\r\nbecome so, when new supplies of radio-active materials have been\r\ndiscovered. It will be the object of succeeding chapters to point out\r\nthe practical ways in which these various stores of energy are drawn\r\nupon and made to do work for man's benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE ANIMAL MACHINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe muscular system is not only the oldest machine in existence,\r\nbut also the most complex. Moreover, it is otherwise entitled to\r\nprecedence, for even to-day, in this so-called age of steam and\r\nelectricity, the muscular system remains by far the most important of\r\nall machines. In the United States alone there are some twenty million\r\nhorses doing work for man; and of course no machine of any sort is\r\never put in motion or continues indefinitely in operation without\r\naid supplied by human muscles. All in all, then, it is impossible to\r\noverestimate the importance of this muscular machine which is at once\r\nthe oldest and the most lasting of all systems of utilizing energy.\r\n\r\nThe physical laws that govern the animal machine are precisely similar\r\nto those that are applied to other mechanisms. All the laws that have\r\nbeen called to our attention must therefore be understood as applying\r\nfully to the muscular mechanism. But in addition to these the muscular\r\nsystem has certain laws or methods of action of its own, some of which\r\nare not very clearly understood.\r\n\r\nThe prime mystery concerning the muscle is its wonderful property of\r\ncontracting. For practical purposes we may say that it has no other\r\nproperty; the sole function of the muscle is to contract. It can, of\r\ncourse, relax, also, to make ready for another contraction, but this\r\nis the full extent of its activities. A microscopic examination of\r\nthe muscle shows that it is composed of minute fibres, each of which\r\non contraction swells up into a spindle shape. A mass of such fibres\r\naggregated together constitutes a muscle, and every muscle is attached\r\nat either extremity, by means of a tendon, to a bone. Both extremities\r\nof a muscle are never attached to the same bone--otherwise the muscle\r\nwould be absolutely useless. Usually there is only a single bone\r\nbetween the two ends of a muscle, but in exceptional cases there may be\r\nmore. As a rule, the main body of a muscle lies along the bone to which\r\none end of it is attached, the other end of the muscle being attached\r\nto the contiguous bone placed not far from the point. The first bone,\r\nthen, serves as a fulcrum on which the second bone moves as a lever,\r\nand, as already pointed out, the familiar laws of the lever operate\r\nhere as fully as in the inanimate world. But a moment's reflection\r\nwill make it clear that the object effected by this mechanism is the\r\nincrease of motion with relative loss of energy. In other words, the\r\nmuscular force is applied to the short end of the lever, and a far\r\ngreater expenditure of force is required when the muscle contracts than\r\nthe power externally manifested would seem to indicate.\r\n\r\nA moment's consideration of the mechanism of the arm, having regard to\r\nthe biceps muscle which flexes the elbow, will make this clear. If a\r\nweight is held in the hand it is perhaps twelve inches from the elbow.\r\nIf, while holding the weight, you will grasp the elbow with the other\r\nhand, you will feel the point of attachment of the biceps, and discover\r\nthat it does not seem to be, roughly speaking, more than about an inch\r\nfrom the joint. Obviously, then, if you are lifting a pound weight, the\r\nactual equivalent of energy expended by the contracting biceps must\r\nbe twelve pounds. But, in the meantime, when the pound weight in your\r\nhand moves through the space of one inch, the muscle has contracted by\r\none-twelfth of an inch; and you may sweep the weight through a distance\r\nof two feet by utilizing the two-inch contraction, which represents\r\nabout the capacity of the muscle.\r\n\r\nA similar consideration of the muscles of the legs will show how the\r\nmuscular system which is susceptible of but trifling variation in size,\r\ngives to the animal great locomotive power. With the aid of a series of\r\nlevers, represented by the bones of our thighs, legs, and feet, we are\r\nable to stride along, covering three or four feet at each step, while\r\nno set of the muscles that effect this propulsion varies in length by\r\nmore than two or three inches. It appears, then, that the muscular\r\nsystem gives a marvelous illustration of capacity for storing energy in\r\na compact form and utilizing it for the development of motion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO TYPES OF MUSCLES\r\n\r\nThe muscles of animals and men alike are divided into two systems,\r\none called voluntary, the other involuntary. The voluntary muscles,\r\nas their name implies, are subject to the influence of the will,\r\nand under ordinary conditions contract in response to the voluntary\r\nnervous impulses. Certain sets of them, indeed, as those having to\r\ndo with respiration, have developed a tendency to rhythmical action\r\nthrough long use, and ordinarily perform their functions without\r\nvoluntary guidance. Their function may, however, become voluntary\r\nwhen attention is directed toward it, and is then subject to the\r\naction of the will within certain bounds. Should a voluntary attempt\r\nbe made, however, to prevent their action indefinitely, the so-called\r\nreflex mechanism presently asserts itself. All of which may be easily\r\nattested by anyone who will attempt to stop breathing. All systems of\r\nvoluntary muscles are subject to the influence of habit, and may assume\r\nactivities that are only partially recognized by consciousness. As an\r\nillustration in point, the muscles involved in walking come, in the\r\ncase of every adult, to perform their function without direct guidance\r\nof the will. Such was not the case, however, in the early stage of\r\ntheir development, as the observation of any child learning to walk\r\nwill amply demonstrate. In the case of animals, however, even those\r\nmuscles are so under the impress of hereditary tendencies as to perform\r\ntheir functions spontaneously almost from the moment of birth. These,\r\nhowever, are physiological details that need not concern us here. It\r\nsuffices to recall that the voluntary muscles may be directed by the\r\nwill, and indeed are always under what may be termed subconscious\r\ndirection, even when the conscious attention is not directed to them.\r\n\r\nThe strictly involuntary muscles, however, are placed absolutely beyond\r\ncontrol of the will. The most important of these muscles are those\r\nthat constitute the heart and the diaphragm, and that enter into the\r\nsubstance of the walls of blood vessels, and of the abdominal organs.\r\nIt is obvious that the functioning of these important organs could not\r\nadvantageously be left to the direction of the will; and so, in the\r\nlong course of evolution they have learned, as it were, to take care\r\nof themselves, and in so doing to take care of the organism, to the\r\nlife of which they are so absolutely essential. As the physiologist\r\nviews the matter, no organism could have developed which did not\r\ncorrespondingly develop such involuntary action of the vital organs.\r\nIt will be seen that the involuntary muscles differ from the voluntary\r\nmuscles in that they are not connected with bones. Instead of being\r\nthus attached to solid levers, they are annular in structure, and in\r\ncontracting virtually change the size of the ring which their substance\r\nconstitutes. Each fibre in contracting may be thought of as pulling\r\nagainst other fibres, instead of against a bony surface, and the joint\r\naction changes the size of the organ, as is obvious in the pulsing of\r\nthe heart.\r\n\r\nThough the rhythmical contractions of the involuntary muscles are\r\nindependent of voluntary control, it must not be supposed that they\r\nare independent of the control of the central nervous mechanism. On\r\nthe contrary, the nerve supply sent out from the brain to the heart\r\nand to the abdominal organs is as plentiful and as important as that\r\nsent to the voluntary muscles. There is a centre in the brain scarcely\r\nlarger than the head of a pin, the destruction of which will cause the\r\nheart instantly to cease beating forever. From this centre, then, and\r\nfrom the other centres of the brain, impulses are constantly sent to\r\nthe involuntary muscles, which determine the rate of activity. Nor are\r\nthese centres absolutely independent of the seat of consciousness, as\r\nanyone will admit who recalls the varied changes in the heart's action\r\nunder stress of varying emotions.\r\n\r\nThat the voluntary muscles are controlled by the central nervous\r\nmechanism needs no proof beyond the appeal to our personal experiences\r\nof every moment. You desire some object that lies on the table in front\r\nof you, and immediately your hand, thanks to the elaborate muscular\r\nmechanism, reaches out and grasps it. And this act is but typical of\r\nthe thousand activities that make up our every-day life. Everyone is\r\naware that the channel of communication between the brain and the\r\nmuscular system is found in a system of nerves, which it is natural\r\nnow-a-days to liken to a system of telegraph wires. We speak of the\r\nimpulse generated in the brain as being transmitted along the nerves to\r\nthe muscle, causing that to contract. We are even able to measure the\r\nspeed of transfer of such an impulse. It is found to move with relative\r\nslowness, compassing only about one hundred and twelve feet per second,\r\nbeing in this regard very unlike the electric current with which it is\r\nso often compared. But the precise nature of this impulse is unknown.\r\nIts effect, however, is made tangible in the muscular contraction\r\nwhich it is its sole purpose to produce. The essential influence of\r\nthe nerve impulse in the transaction is easily demonstrable; for if\r\nthe nerve cord is severed, as often happens in accidents, the muscle\r\nsupplied by that nerve immediately loses its power of voluntary\r\ncontraction. It becomes paralyzed, as the saying is.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURE OF MUSCULAR ACTION\r\n\r\nPaying heed, now, to the muscle itself, it must be freely admitted\r\nthat, in the last analysis, the activities of the substance are as\r\nmysterious and as inexplicable as are those involved in the nervous\r\nmechanism. It is easy to demonstrate that what we have just spoken\r\nof as a muscle fibre consists in reality of a little tube of liquid\r\nprotoplasm, and that the change in shape of this protoplasm constitutes\r\nthe contraction of which we are all along speaking. But just what\r\nmolecular and atomic changes are involved in this change of form of the\r\nprotoplasm, we cannot say. We know that the power to contract is the\r\none universal attribute of living protoplasm. This power is equally\r\nwonderful and equally inexplicable, whether manifested in the case\r\nof the muscle cell or in the case of such a formless single-celled\r\ncreature as the amoeba. When we know more of molecular and atomic\r\nforce, we may perhaps be able to form a mental picture of what goes on\r\nin the structure of protoplasm when it thus changes the shape of its\r\nmass. Until then, we must be content to accept the fact as being the\r\nvital one upon which all the movements of animate creatures depend.\r\n\r\nBut if, here as elsewhere, the ultimate activities of molecules and\r\natoms lie beyond our ken, we may nevertheless gain an insight into\r\nthe nature of the substances involved. We know, for example, that the\r\nchief constituents of all protoplasm are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and\r\nnitrogen; and that with these main elements there are traces of various\r\nother elements such as iron, sulphur, phosphorus, and sundry salts.\r\nWe know that when the muscle contracts some of these constituents\r\nare disarranged through what is spoken of as chemical decomposition,\r\nand that there results a change in the substance of the protoplasm,\r\naccompanied by the excretion of a certain portion of its constituents,\r\nand by the liberation of heat. Carbonic acid gas, for example, is\r\ngenerated and is swept away from the muscular tissues in the ever\r\nactive bloodstreams, to be carried to the lungs and there expelled--it\r\nbeing a noxious poison, fatal to life if retained in large quantities.\r\nEqually noxious are other substances such as uric acid and its\r\ncompounds, which are also results of the breaking down of tissue that\r\nattends muscular action. In a word, there is an incessant formation of\r\nwaste products, due to muscular activity, the removal of which requires\r\nthe constant service of the purifying streams of blood and of the\r\nvarious excretory organs.\r\n\r\nBut this constant outflow of waste products from the muscle\r\nnecessitates, of course, in accordance with the laws of the\r\nconservation of matter and of energy, an equally constant supply\r\nof new matter to take the place of the old. This supply of what is\r\nvirtually fuel to be consumed, enabling the muscle to perform its\r\nwork, is brought to the muscle through the streams of blood which flow\r\nfrom the heart in the arterial channels, and in part also through the\r\nlymphatic system. The blood itself gains its supply from the digestive\r\nsystem and from the lungs. The digestive system supplies water, that\r\nall-essential diluent, and a great variety of compounds elaborated into\r\nthe proper pabulum; while the vital function of the lungs is to supply\r\noxygen, which must be incessantly present in order that the combustion\r\nwhich attends muscular activity may take place. What virtually happens\r\nis that fuel is sent from the digestive system to be burned in the\r\nmuscular system, with the aid of oxygen brought from the lungs.\r\n\r\nIn this view, the muscular apparatus is a species of heat engine. In\r\npoint of fact, it is a curiously delicate one as regards the range of\r\nconditions within which it is able to act. The temperature of any given\r\norganism is almost invariable; the human body, for example, maintains\r\nan average temperature of 98-2/5 degrees, Fahrenheit. The range of\r\nvariation from this temperature in conditions of health is rarely\r\nmore than a fraction of a degree; and even under stress of the most\r\nsevere fever the temperature never rises more than about eight degrees\r\nwithout a fatal result. That an organism which is producing heat in\r\nsuch varying quantities through its varying muscular activities should\r\nmaintain such an equilibrium of temperature, would seem one of the most\r\nmarvelous of facts, were it not so familiar.\r\n\r\nThe physical means by which the heat thus generated is rapidly given\r\noff, on occasion, to meet the varying conditions of muscular activity,\r\nis largely dependent upon the control of the blood supply, in which\r\ninvoluntary muscles, similar to those of the heart, are concerned.\r\nIn times of great muscular activity, when the production of heat is\r\nrelatively enormous, the arterioles that supply the surface of the\r\nbody are rapidly dilated so that a preponderance of blood circulates\r\nat the surface of the body, where it may readily radiate its heat into\r\nspace; the vast system of perspiratory ducts, with which the skin is\r\neverywhere supplied, aiding enormously in facilitating this result,\r\nthrough the secretion of a film of perspiration, which in evaporating\r\ntakes up large quantities of heat.\r\n\r\nThe flushed, perspiring face of a person who has violently exercised\r\ngives a familiar proof of these physiological changes; and the contrary\r\ncondition, in which the peripheral circulation is restricted, and in\r\nwhich the pores are closed, is equally familiar. Moreover, the same\r\ncutaneous mechanism is efficient in affording the organism protection\r\nfrom the changes of external temperature; though the human machine,\r\nthanks to the pampering influence of civilization, requires additional\r\nprotection in the form of clothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS OF MUSCULAR ENERGY\r\n\r\nHaving thus outlined the conditions under which the muscular machine\r\nperforms its work, we have now to consider briefly the external\r\nmechanisms with the aid of which muscular energy is utilized.\r\nOf course, the simplest application of this power, and the one\r\nuniversally employed in the animal world is that in which a direct\r\npush or pull is given to the substance, the position of which it\r\nis desired to change. We have already pointed out that there is no\r\nessential difference between pushing and pulling. The fact receives\r\nanother illustration in considering the muscular mechanism. We speak\r\nof pushing when we propel something away from a body, of pulling when\r\nwe draw something toward it, yet, as we have just seen, each can be\r\naccomplished merely through the contraction of a set of muscles, acting\r\non differently disposed levers. All the bodily activities are reducible\r\nto such muscular contractions, and the diversified movements in which\r\nthe organism constantly indulges are merely due to the large number and\r\nelaborate arrangement of the bony levers upon which these muscles are\r\noperated.\r\n\r\nWe may well suppose that the primitive man continued for a long\r\nperiod of time to perform all such labors as he undertook without\r\nthe aid of any artificial mechanism; that is to say, without having\r\nlearned to gain any power beyond that which the natural levers\r\nof his body provided. A brief observation of the actions of a\r\nman performing any piece of manual labor will, however, quickly\r\ndemonstrate how ingeniously the bodily levers are employed, and how\r\nby shifting positions the worker unconsciously makes the most of a\r\ngiven expenditure of energy. By bending the arms and bringing them\r\nclose to the body, he is able to shorten his levers so that he can\r\nlift a much greater weight than he could possibly raise with the arms\r\nextended. On the other hand, with the extended arm he can strike a\r\nmuch more powerful blow than with the shorter lever of the flexed\r\narm. But however ingenious the manipulation of the natural levers, a\r\nfull utilization of muscular energy is possible only when they are\r\nsupplemented with artificial aids, which constitute primitive pieces of\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nThese aids are chiefly of three types, namely, inclined planes,\r\nfriction reducers, and levers. The use of the inclined plane was very\r\nearly discovered and put into practise in chipped implements, which\r\ntook the form of the wedge, in such modifications as axes, knives, and\r\nspears of metal. All of these implements, it will be observed, consist\r\nessentially of inclined planes, adapted for piercing relatively soft\r\ntissues of wood or flesh, and hence serving purposes of the greatest\r\npractical utility.\r\n\r\nThe knife-blade is an extremely thin wedge, to be utilized by force of\r\npushing, without any great aid from acquired momentum. The hatchet, on\r\nthe other hand--and its modification the axe--has its blunter blade\r\nfastened to a handle; that the principle of the wedge may be utilized\r\nat the long end of a lever and with the momentum of a swinging blow.\r\nAges before anyone could have explained the principle involved in such\r\nobscuring terms as that, the implement itself was in use for the same\r\npurpose to which it is still applied. Indeed, there is probably no\r\nother implement that has played a larger part in the history of human\r\nindustry. Even in the Rough Stone Age it was in full favor, and the\r\nearliest metallurgists produced it in bronze and then in iron. The\r\nblade of to-day is made of the best tempered steel, and the handle\r\nor helve of hickory is given a slight curve that is an improvement on\r\nthe straight handle formerly employed; but on the whole it may be said\r\nthat the axe is a surviving primitive implement that has held its own\r\nand demonstrated its utility in every generation since the dawn, not of\r\nhistory only, but of barbarism, perhaps even of savagery.\r\n\r\nThe saw, consisting essentially of a thin elongated blade, one ragged\r\nor toothed edge, is a scarcely less primitive and an equally useful and\r\nfamiliar application of the principle of the inclined plane--though it\r\nrequires a moment's reflection to see the manner of application. Each\r\ntooth, however minute, is an inclined plane, calculated to slide over\r\nthe tissue of wood or stone or iron even, yet to tear at the tissue\r\nwith its point, and, with the power of numbers, ultimately wear it away.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHEEL AND AXLE\r\n\r\nThe primitive friction reducer, which continues in use to the present\r\nday unmodified in principle, is the wheel revolving on an axle.\r\nDoubtless man had reached a very high state of barbarism before he\r\ninvented such a wheel. The American Indian, for example, knew no\r\nbetter method than to carry his heavy burdens on his shoulders, or\r\ndrag them along the ground, with at most a pair of parallel poles or\r\nrunners to modify the friction; every move representing a very wasteful\r\nexpenditure of energy. But the pre-historic man of the old world had\r\nmade the wonderful discovery that a wheel revolving on an axle vastly\r\nreduces the friction between a weight and the earth, and thus enables\r\na man or a woman to convey a load that would be far beyond his or her\r\nunaided powers. It is well to use both genders in this illustration,\r\nsince among primitive peoples it is usually the woman who is the bearer\r\nof burdens. And indeed to this day one may see the women of Italy and\r\nGermany bearing large burdens on their backs and heads, and dragging\r\ncarts about the streets, quite after the primitive method.\r\n\r\nThe more one considers the mechanism, the more one must marvel at the\r\ningenuity of the pre-historic man who invented the wheel and axle. Its\r\nutility is sufficiently obvious once the thing has been done. In point\r\nof fact, it so enormously reduces the friction that a man may convey\r\nten times the burden with its aid that he can without it. But how was\r\nthe primitive man, with his small knowledge of mechanics, to predict\r\nsuch a result? In point of fact, of course, he made no such prediction.\r\nDoubtless his attention was first called to the utility of rolling\r\nbodies by a chance observation of dragging a burden along a pebbly\r\nbeach, or over rolling stones. The observation of logs or round stones\r\nrolling down a hill might also have stimulated the imagination of some\r\ninventive genius.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BELGIAN MILK-WAGON.\r\n\r\nIn many of the countries of Europe the dog plays an important part as\r\na beast of burden. Stringent laws are enforced in these countries to\r\nprevent possible abuse or neglect of the animals.]\r\n\r\nProbably logs placed beneath heavy weights, such as are still employed\r\nsometimes in moving houses, were utilized now and again for many\r\ngenerations before the idea of a narrow section of a log adjusted on\r\nan axis was evolved. But be that as it may, this idea was put into\r\npractise before the historic period begins, and we find the earliest\r\ncivilized races of which we have record--those, namely, of Old Egypt\r\nand of Old Babylonia--in full possession of the principle of the wheel\r\nas applied to vehicles. Modern mechanics have, of course, improved the\r\nmechanism as regards details, but the wheels depicted in Old Egyptian\r\nand Babylonian inscriptions are curiously similar to the most modern\r\ntypes. Indeed, the wheel is a striking illustration of a mechanism\r\nwhich continued century after century to serve the purposes of the\r\npractical worker, with seemingly no prospect of displacement.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODIFIED LEVERS\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the mechanisms which primitive man learned early to\r\nuse in adding to his working efficiency, and which are still used by\r\nthe hand laborer, are virtually all modifications of our familiar\r\ntype-implement, the lever. A moment's reflection will show that the\r\ndiversified purposes of the crowbar, hoe, shovel, hammer, drill,\r\nchisel, are all accomplished with the aid of the same principles.\r\nThe crowbar, for example, enables man to regain the power which he\r\nlost when his members were adapted to locomotion. His hands, left\r\nto themselves, as we have already pointed out, give but inadequate\r\nexpression to the power of his muscles. But by grasping the long end of\r\nsuch a lever as the crowbar, he is enabled to utilize his entire weight\r\nin addition to his muscular strength, and, with the aid of this lever,\r\nto lift many times his weight.\r\n\r\nThe hoe, on the other hand, becomes virtually a lengthened arm,\r\nenabling a very slight muscular motion to be transformed into the\r\nlong sweep of the implement, so that with small expenditure of energy\r\nthe desired work is accomplished. Similarly, the sledge and the axe\r\nlengthen out the lever of the arms, so that great momentum is readily\r\nacquired, and with the aid of inertia a relatively enormous force can\r\nbe applied. It will be observed that a laborer in raising a heavy\r\nsledge brings the head of the implement near his body, thus shortening\r\nthe leverage and gaining power at the expense of speed; but extends his\r\narms to their full length as the sledge falls, having now the aid of\r\ngravitation, to gain the full advantage of the long arm of the lever in\r\nacquiring momentum.\r\n\r\nEven such elaborately modified implements as the treadmill and the\r\nrowboat are operated on the principle of the lever. These also are\r\nmechanisms that have come down to us from a high antiquity. Their\r\nutility, however, has been greatly decreased in modern times, by\r\nthe substitution of more elaborate and economical mechanisms for\r\naccomplishing their respective purposes. The treadmill, indeed--which\r\nmight be likened to an overshot waterwheel in which the human foot\r\nsupplied the place of the falling water in giving power--has become\r\nobsolete, though a modification of it, to be driven by animal power, is\r\nstill sometimes used, as we shall see in a moment.\r\n\r\nAll these are illustrations of mechanisms with the aid of which human\r\nlabor is made effective. They show the devices by which primitive man\r\nused his ingenuity in making his muscular system a more effective\r\nmachine for the performance of work. But perhaps the most ingenious\r\nfeat of all which our primitive ancestor accomplished was in learning\r\nto utilize the muscular energy of other animals. Of course the example\r\nwas always before him in the observed activity of the animals on every\r\nside. Nevertheless, it was doubtless long before the idea suggested\r\nitself, and probably longer still before it was put into practise, of\r\nutilizing this almost inexhaustible natural supply of working energy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATED ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe first animal domesticated is believed to have been the dog, and\r\nthis animal is still used, as everyone knows, as a beast of burden in\r\nthe far North, and in some European cities, particularly in those of\r\nGermany. Subsequently the ox was domesticated, but it is probable that\r\nfor a vast period of time it was used for food purposes, rather than as\r\na beast of burden. And lastly the horse, the worker _par excellence_,\r\nwas made captive by some Asiatic tribes having the genius of invention,\r\nand in due course this fleetest of carriers and most efficient of\r\ndraught animals was introduced into all civilized nations.\r\n\r\nDoubtless for a long time the energy of the horse was utilized in an\r\nuneconomical way, through binding the burden on its back, or causing it\r\nto drag the burden along the ground. But this is inferential, since,\r\nas we have seen, the wheel was invented in pre-historic times, and at\r\nthe dawn of history we find the Babylonians driving harnessed horses\r\nattached to wheeled vehicles. From that day to this the method of\r\nusing horse-power has not greatly changed. The vast majority of the\r\nmany millions of horses that are employed every day in helping on the\r\nworld's work, use their strength without gain or loss through leverage,\r\nand with only the aid of rolling friction to increase their capacity as\r\nbeasts of burden.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent horse-power is still used with the aid of the\r\nmodified treadmill just referred to--consisting essentially of an\r\ninclined plane of flexible mechanism made into an endless platform,\r\nwhich the horse causes to revolve as he goes through the movements of\r\nwalking upon it. In agricultural districts this form of power is still\r\nsometimes used to run threshing machines, cider mills, wood-saws,\r\nand the like. Another application of horse-power to the same ends\r\nis accomplished through harnessing a horse to a long lever like the\r\nspoke of a wheel, fastened to an axis, which is made to revolve as the\r\nhorse walks about it. Several horses are sometimes hitched to such\r\na mechanism, which becomes then a wheel of several spokes. But this\r\nmechanism, which was common enough in agricultural districts two or\r\nthree decades ago, has been practically superseded in recent years by\r\nthe perambulatory steam engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO APPARATUSES FOR THE UTILIZATION OF ANIMAL POWER.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure shows the type of portable horse-power machine used\r\nfor threshing grain in 1851. The lower figure is an inclined-plane\r\nhorse-gear. The horse stands on the sloping platform tied to the bar in\r\nfront, so that it is compelled to walk as the platform recedes.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the amount of work which a horse can accomplish\r\nmust vary greatly with the size and quality of the horse, and with the\r\nparticular method by which its energy is applied. For the purposes\r\nof comparison, however, an arbitrary amount of work has been fixed\r\nupon as constituting what is called a horse-power. This amount is the\r\nequivalent of raising thirty-three thousand pounds of weight to the\r\nheight of one foot in one minute. It would be hard to say just why this\r\nparticular standard was fixed upon, since it certainly represents more\r\nthan the average capacity of a horse. It is, however, a standard which\r\nlong usage (it was first suggested by Watt, of steam-engine fame) has\r\nrendered convenient, and one which the machinist refers to constantly\r\nin speaking of the efficiency of the various types of artificial\r\nmachines. All questions of the exact legitimacy of this particular\r\nstandard aside, it was highly appropriate that the labor of the horse,\r\nwhich has made up so large a share of the labor of the past, and which\r\nis still so extensively utilized, should continue to be taken as the\r\nmeasuring standard of the world's work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF AIR AND WATER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe store of energy contained in the atmosphere and in the waters of\r\nthe globe is inexhaustible. Its amount is beyond all calculation; or if\r\nit were vaguely calculated the figures would be quite incomprehensible\r\nfrom their very magnitude. It is not, however, an altogether simple\r\nmatter to make this energy available for the purposes of useful work.\r\nWe find that throughout antiquity comparatively little use was made of\r\neither wind or water in their application to machinery.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the earliest use of air as a motive power was through the\r\napplication of sails to boats. We know that the Phoenicians used a\r\nsimple form of sail, and no doubt their example was followed by all the\r\nmaritime peoples of subsequent periods. But the use of the sail even by\r\nthe Phoenicians was as a comparatively unimportant accessory to the\r\ngalaxies of oars, which formed the chief motive power. The elaboration\r\nof sails of various types, adequate in extent to propel large ships,\r\nand capable of being adjusted so as to take advantage of winds blowing\r\nfrom almost any quarter, was a development of the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of work with the aid of running water were also but\r\nlittle understood by the ancients. In the days of slave labor it was\r\nscarcely worth while to tax man's ingenuity to invent machines, since\r\nso efficient a one was provided by nature. Yet the properties of both\r\nair and water were studied by various mechanical philosophers, at the\r\nhead of whom were Archimedes, whose work has already been referred to,\r\nand the famous Alexandrian, Ctesibius, whose investigations became\r\nfamiliar through the publications of his pupil, Hero.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable device invented by Ctesibius was a\r\nfire-engine, consisting of an arrangement of valves constituting a\r\npump, and operating on the principle which is still in vogue. It is\r\nknown, however, that the Egyptians of a much earlier period used\r\nbuckets having valves in their bottoms, and these perhaps furnished the\r\nfoundation for the idea of Ctesibius. It is unnecessary to give details\r\nof this fire-engine. It may be noted, however, that the principle of\r\nthe lever is the one employed in its operation to gain power. A valve\r\nconsists essentially of any simple hinged substance, arranged so that\r\nit may rise or fall, alternately opening and closing an aperture.\r\nA mere flap of leather, nailed on one edge, serves as a tolerably\r\neffective valve. At least one of the valves used by Ctesibius was a\r\nhinged piece of smooth metal. A piston fitted in a cylinder supplies\r\nsuction when the lever is raised, and pressure when it is compressed,\r\nalternately opening the valve and closing the valve through which the\r\nwater enters the tube. Meantime a second valve alternating with the\r\nfirst permits the water to enter the chamber containing air, which\r\nthrough its elasticity and pressure equalizes the force of the stream\r\nthat is ejected from the chamber through the hose.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCTION AND PRESSURE\r\n\r\nIn the construction of this and various other apparatus, Ctesibius and\r\nHero were led to make careful studies of the phenomena of suction. But\r\nin this they were not alone, since numerous of their predecessors had\r\nstudied the subject, and such an apparatus as the surgeon's cupping\r\nglass was familiarly known several centuries before the Christian era.\r\nThe cupping glass, as perhaps should be explained to the reader of the\r\npresent day--since the apparatus went out of vogue in ordinary medical\r\npractise two or three generations ago--consists of a glass cup in which\r\nthe air is exhausted, so as to suck blood from any part of the surface\r\nof a body to which it is applied. Hero describes a method of exhausting\r\nair by which such suction may be facilitated. But neither he nor any\r\nother philosopher of his period at all understood the real nature of\r\nthis suction, notwithstanding their perfect familiarity with numerous\r\nof its phenomena. It was known, for example, that when a tube closed\r\nat one end is filled with water and inverted with the open end beneath\r\nthe surface of the water, the water remains in the tube, although one\r\nmight naturally expect that it would obey the impulses of gravitation\r\nand run out, leaving the tube empty. A familiar explanation of this and\r\nallied phenomena throughout antiquity was found in the saying that\r\n\"Nature abhors a vacuum.\" This explanation, which of course amounts\r\nto no explanation at all, is fairly illustrative of the method of\r\nmetaphysical word-juggling that served so largely among the earlier\r\nphilosophers in explanation of the mysteries of physical science.\r\n\r\nThe real explanation of the phenomena of suction was not arrived\r\nat until the revival of learning in the seventeenth century. Then\r\nTorricelli, the pupil of Galileo, demonstrated that the word suction,\r\nas commonly applied, had no proper application; and that the phenomena\r\nhitherto ascribed to it were really due to the pressure of the\r\natmosphere. A vacuum is merely an enclosed space deprived of air, and\r\nthe \"abhorrence\" that Nature shows to such a space is due to the fact\r\nthat air has weight and presses in every direction, and hence tends\r\nto invade every space to which it can gain access. It was presently\r\ndiscovered that if the inverted tube in which the water stands was\r\nmade high enough, the water will no longer fill it, but will sink to a\r\ncertain level. The height at which it will stand is about thirty feet;\r\nabove that height a vacuum will be formed, which, for some reason,\r\nNature seems not to abhor. The reason is that the weight of any given\r\ncolumn of water about thirty feet in height is just balanced by the\r\nweight of a corresponding column of atmosphere. The experiments that\r\ngave the proof of this were made by the famous Englishman, Boyle. He\r\nshowed that if the heavy liquid, mercury, is used in place of water,\r\nthen the suspended column will be only about thirty inches in height.\r\nThe weight or pressure of the atmosphere at sea level, as measured by\r\nthese experiments, is about fifteen pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\nBoyle's further experiments with the air and with other gases developed\r\nthe fact that the pressure exerted by any given quantity of gas is\r\nproportional to the external pressure to which it is subjected, which,\r\nafter all, is only a special application of the law that action and\r\nreaction are equal. The further fact was developed that under pressure\r\na gas decreases at a fixed rate in bulk. A general law, expressing\r\nthese facts in the phrase that density and elasticity vary inversely\r\nwith the pressure in a precise ratio, was developed by Boyle and the\r\nFrenchman, Mariotte, independently, and bears the name of both of its\r\ndiscoverers. No immediate application of the law to the practical\r\npurposes of the worker was made, however, and it is only in recent\r\nyears that compressed air has been extensively employed as a motive\r\npower. Even now it has not proved a great commercial success, because\r\nother more economical methods of power production are available. In\r\nparticular cases, however, it has a certain utility, as a relatively\r\nlarge available source of energy may be condensed into a very small\r\nreceptacle.\r\n\r\nA very striking experiment illustrating the pressure of the air was\r\nmade by a famous contemporary of Boyle and Mariotte, by the name of\r\nOtto von Guericke. He connected an air pump with a large brass sphere,\r\ncomposed of two hemispheres, the edges of which fitted smoothly, but\r\nwere not connected by any mechanism. Under ordinary conditions the\r\nhemispheres would fall apart readily, but von Guericke proved, by\r\na famous public demonstration, that when the air was exhausted in\r\nthe sphere, teams of horses pulling in opposite directions on the\r\nhemispheres could not separate them. This is famous as the experiment\r\nof the Magdeburg spheres, and it is often repeated on a smaller scale\r\nin the modern physical laboratory, to the astonishment of the tyro in\r\nphysical experiments.\r\n\r\nThe first question that usually comes to the mind of anyone who has\r\npersonally witnessed such an experiment, is the question as to how\r\nthe human body can withstand the tremendous force to which it is\r\nsubjected by an atmosphere exerting a pressure of fifteen pounds on\r\nevery square inch of its surface. The explanation is found in the\r\nuniform distribution of the pressure, the influence of which is thus\r\ncounteracted, and by the fact that the tissues themselves contain\r\neverywhere a certain amount of air at the same pressure. The familiar\r\nexperiment of holding the hand over an exhausted glass cylinder--which\r\nexperiment is indeed but a modification of the use of the cupping\r\nglass above referred to--illustrates very forcibly the insupportable\r\ndifficulties which the human body would encounter were not its entire\r\nsurface uniformly subjected to the atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIR IN MOTION\r\n\r\nAt about the time when the scientific experiments with the pressure of\r\ngases were being made, practical studies of the effects of masses of\r\nair in motion were undertaken by the Dutch philosopher, Servinus. The\r\nuse of the windmill in Holland as a means of generating power doubtless\r\nsuggested to Servinus the possibility of attaching a sail to a land\r\nvehicle. He made the experiment, and in the year 1600 constructed a\r\nsailing car which, propelled by the wind, traversed the land to a\r\nconsiderable distance, on one occasion conveying a company of which\r\nPrince Maurice of Orange was a member. But his experiments have seldom\r\nbeen repeated, and indeed their lack of practical feasibility scarcely\r\nneeds demonstration.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the wind, however, in generating the power in a\r\nstationary mechanism is familiar to everyone. Windmills were\r\nconstructed at a comparatively early period, and notwithstanding all\r\nthe recent progress in the development of steam and electrical power,\r\nthis relatively primitive so-called prime mover still holds its own in\r\nagricultural districts, particularly in its application to pumps. A\r\nwindmill consists of a series of inclined planes, each of which forms\r\none of the radii of a circle, or spokes of a wheel, to the axle of\r\nwhich a gearing is adjusted by which the power generated is utilized.\r\nThe wheel is made to face the wind by the wind itself blowing against a\r\nsort of rudder which projects from the axis. The wind blowing against\r\nthe inclined surfaces or vanes of the wheel causes each vane to move in\r\naccordance with the law of component forces, thus revolving the wheel\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINDMILLS OF ANCIENT AND MODERN TYPES.\r\n\r\nThe smaller figures show Dutch windmills of the present day, many of\r\nwhich are identical in structure with the windmills of the middle ages.\r\nIt will be seen that the sails can be furled when desired to put the\r\nmill out of operation. In the mill of modern type (large figure) the\r\nsame effect is produced by slanting the slats of the wheel.]\r\n\r\nIt has been affirmed that the Romans had windmills, but \"the silence of\r\nVitruvius, Seneca, and Chrysostom, who have spoken of the advantages of\r\nthe wind, makes this opinion questionable.\" It has been supposed by\r\nother writers that windmills were used in France in the sixth century,\r\nwhile still others have maintained that this mechanism was unknown in\r\nEurope until the time of the Crusades. All that is tolerably certain\r\nis that in the twelfth century windmills were in use in France and\r\nEngland. It is recorded that when they began to be somewhat common\r\nPope Celestine III. determined that the tithes of them belonged to the\r\nclergy.\r\n\r\n\r\nINHERENT DEFECTS OF THE WINDMILL\r\n\r\nThe mediæval European windmill was supplied with great sails of cloth,\r\nand its picturesque appearance has been made familiar to everyone\r\nthrough the famous tale of _Don Quixote_. The modern windmill, acting\r\non precisely the same principle, is a comparatively small affair,\r\ncomprising many vanes of metal, and constituting a far more practical\r\nmachine. The great defect of all windmills, however, is found in the\r\nfact that of necessity they furnish such variable power, since the\r\nforce of the wind is incessantly changing. Worst of all, there may be\r\nprotracted periods of atmospheric calm, during which, of course, the\r\nwindmill ceases to have any utility whatever. This ineradicable defect\r\nrelegates the windmill to a subordinate place among prime movers, yet\r\non the other hand, its cheapness insures its employment for a long time\r\nto come, and the industry of manufacturing windmills continues to be an\r\nimportant one, particularly in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUNNING WATER\r\n\r\nThe aggregate amount of work accomplished with the aid of the wind is\r\nbut trifling, compared with that which is accomplished with the aid of\r\nwater. The supply of water is practically inexhaustible, and this fluid\r\nbeing much more manageable than air, can be made a far more dependable\r\naid to the worker. Every stream, whatever its rate of flow, represents\r\nan enormous store of potential energy. A cubic foot of water weighs\r\nabout sixty-two and a half pounds. The working capacity of any mass\r\nof water is represented by one-half its weight into the square of its\r\nvelocity; or, stated otherwise, by its weight into the distance of its\r\nfall. Now, since the interiors of the continents, where rivers find\r\ntheir sources, are often elevated by some hundreds or even thousands\r\nof feet, it follows that the working energy expended--and for the most\r\npart wasted--by the aggregate water current of the world is beyond all\r\ncalculation. Meantime, however, a portion of the energy which in the\r\naggregate represents an enormous working power is utilized with the aid\r\nof various types of water wheels.\r\n\r\nWatermills appear to have been introduced in the time of Mithridates,\r\nJulius Cæsar, and Cicero. Strabo informs us that there was a watermill\r\nnear the residence of Mithridates; and we learn from Pomponius Sabinus,\r\nthat the first mill seen at Rome was erected on the Tiber, a little\r\nbefore the time of Augustus. That they existed in the time of Augustus\r\nis obvious from the description given of them by Vitruvius, and the\r\nepigram of Antipater, who is supposed to have lived in the time of\r\nCicero. But though mills driven by water were introduced at this early\r\nperiod, yet public mills did not appear till the time of Honorius and\r\nArcadius. They were erected on three canals, which conveyed water to\r\nthe city, and the greater number of them lay under Mount Janiculum.\r\nWhen the Goths besieged Rome in 536, and stopped the large aqueduct and\r\nconsequently the mills, Belisarius appears to have constructed, for the\r\nfirst time, floating mills upon the Tiber. Mills driven by the tide\r\nexisted at Venice in the year 1046, or at least in 1078.\r\n\r\nThe older types of water wheel are exceedingly simple in construction,\r\nconsisting merely of vertical wheels revolving on horizontal axes,\r\nand so placed as to receive the weight or pressure of the water on\r\npaddles or buckets at their circumference. The water might be allowed\r\nto rush under the wheel, thus constituting an under-shot wheel; or\r\nmore commonly it flows from above, constituting an over-shot wheel.\r\nWhere the natural fall is not available, dams are employed to supply an\r\nartificial fall.\r\n\r\nThis primitive type of water wheel has been practically abandoned\r\nwithin the last generation, its place having been taken by the much\r\nmore efficient type of wheel known as the turbine. This consists of\r\na wheel, usually adjusted on a vertical axis, and acting on what is\r\nvirtually the principle of a windmill. To gain a mental picture of the\r\nturbine in its simplest form, one might imagine the propelling screw\r\nof a steamship, placed horizontally in a tube, so that the water could\r\nrush against its blades. The tiny windmills which children often make\r\nby twisting pieces of paper illustrate the same principle. Of course,\r\nin its developed form the turbine is somewhat elaborated, in the aim to\r\nutilize as large a proportion of the energy of the falling water as is\r\npossible; but the principle remains the same.\r\n\r\nThe turbine wheel was invented by a Frenchman named Fourneyron, about\r\nthree-quarters of a century ago (1827), but its great popularity, in\r\nAmerica in particular, is a matter of the last twenty or thirty years.\r\nTo-day it has virtually supplanted every other type of water wheel.\r\nTo use any other is indeed a wasteful extravagance, as the perfected\r\nturbine makes available more than eighty per cent. of the kinetic\r\nenergy of any mass of falling water. A turbine wheel two feet in\r\ndiameter is able to do the work of an enormous wheel of the old type.\r\n\r\nTurbine wheels are of several types, one operating in a closed tube to\r\nwhich air has no access, and another in an open space in the presence\r\nof air. The water may also be made to enter the turbine at the side\r\nor from below, thus serving to support the weight of the mechanism--a\r\nconsideration of great importance in the case of such gigantic turbines\r\nas those that are employed at Niagara Falls, which we shall have\r\noccasion to examine in detail in a later chapter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER WHEELS.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows a model of the so-called breast wheel, a familiar type of\r\nwater wheel that has been in use since the time of the Romans. Figs.\r\n2 and 3 show similar wheels as used to-day in Belgium. Fig. 4 shows a\r\nmodel of Fourneyron's turbine. This wheel was made in 1837, but the\r\noriginal turbine was introduced by Fourneyron in 1827. The turbine\r\nwheel has now almost supplanted the other forms of water wheel except\r\nin rural districts.]\r\n\r\nThe power generated by a revolution of the turbine wheel may, of\r\ncourse, be utilized directly by belts or gearings attached to its\r\naxle, or it may be transferred to a distance, with the aid of a\r\ndynamo generating electricity. The latter possibility, which has only\r\nrecently been developed, and which we shall have occasion to examine\r\nin detail in connection with our studies of the power at Niagara, gives\r\na new field of usefulness to the turbine wheel, and makes it probable\r\nthat this form of power will be vastly more used in the future than\r\nit has been in the past. Indeed, it would not be surprising were it\r\nultimately to become the prime source of working energy as utilized in\r\nevery department of the world's work.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward H. Sanborn, in an article on Motive Power Appliances in the\r\nTwelfth Census Report of the United States, comments upon the recent\r\nadvances in the use of water wheels as follows:\r\n\r\n\"One notable advance in turbine construction has been the production\r\nof a type of wheel especially designed for operating under much higher\r\nheads of water than were formerly considered feasible for wheels of\r\nthis type. Turbines are now built for heads ranging from 100 to 1,200\r\nfeet, and quite a number of wheels are in operation under heads of from\r\n100 to 200 feet. This is an encroachment upon the field occupied almost\r\nexclusively by wheels variously known as the 'impulse,' 'impact,'\r\n'tangential,' or 'jet' type, the principle of which is the impact of\r\na powerful jet of water from a small nozzle upon a series of buckets\r\nmounted upon the periphery of a small wheel.\"\r\n\r\n\"The impact water wheel,\" Mr. Sanborn continues, \"has come largely\r\ninto use during the last ten years, principally in the far West,\r\nwhere higher heads of water are available than can be found in other\r\nparts of the country. With wheels of this type, exceedingly simple\r\nin construction and of comparatively small cost, a large amount of\r\npower is developed with great economy under the great heads that are\r\navailable. With the tremendous water pressure developed by heads of\r\n1,000 feet and upward, which in many cases are used for this purpose,\r\nwheels of small diameter develop an extraordinary amount of power.\r\nTo the original type of impact wheel which first led the field have\r\nbeen added several styles embodying practically the same principle.\r\nConsiderable study has been given to the designing of buckets with a\r\nview to securing free discharge and the avoidance of any disturbing\r\neddies, and important improvements have resulted from the thorough\r\ninvestigation of the action of the water during, and subsequent to,\r\nits impact on the buckets. The impact wheel has been adapted to a wide\r\nrange of service with great variation as to the conditions under which\r\nit operates, wheels having been made in California from 30 inches to\r\n30 feet in diameter, and to work under heads ranging from 35 to 2,100\r\nfeet, and at speeds ranging from 65 to 1,100 revolutions per minute. A\r\nnumber of wheels of this type have been built with capacities of not\r\nless than 1,000 horse-power each.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC POWER\r\n\r\nA few words should be said about the familiar method of transmitting\r\npower with the aid of water, as illustrated by the hydrostatic press.\r\nThis does not indeed utilize the energy of the water itself, but it\r\nenables the worker to transmit energy supplied from without, and to\r\ngain an indefinite power to move weights through a short distance,\r\nwith the expenditure of very little working energy. The principle on\r\nwhich the hydrostatic press is based is the one which was familiar to\r\nthe ancient philosophers under the name of the hydrostatic paradox.\r\nIt was observed that if a tube is connected with a closed receptacle,\r\nsuch as a strong cask, and cask and tube are filled with water, the\r\ncask will presently be burst by the pressure of the water, provided the\r\ntube is raised to a height, even though the actual weight of water in\r\nthe tube be comparatively slight. A powerful cask, for example, may be\r\nburst by the water poured into a slender pipe. The result seems indeed\r\nparadoxical, and for a long time no explanation of it was forthcoming.\r\nIt remained for Servinus, whose horseless wagon is elsewhere noticed,\r\nto discover that the water at any given level presses equally in all\r\ndirections, and that its pressure is proportionate to its depth, quite\r\nregardless of its bulk. Then, supposing the tube in our experiment to\r\nhave a cross-section of one square inch, a pressure equal to that in\r\nthe tube would be transmitted to each square inch of the surface of the\r\ncask; and the pressure might thus become enormous.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of a tube lifted to a height, the same tube is connected\r\nwith a force pump operated with a lever--an apparatus similar to the\r\nfire-engine of Ctesibius--it is obvious that precisely the same effect\r\nmay be produced; whatever pressure is developed in the piston of the\r\nforce pump, similar pressure will be transferred to a corresponding\r\narea in the surface of the cask or receptacle with which the force pump\r\nconnects. In practise this principle is utilized, where great pressure\r\nis desired, by making a receptacle with an enormous piston connecting\r\nwith the force pump just described.\r\n\r\nAn indefinite power may thus be developed, the apparatus constituting\r\nvirtually a gigantic lever. But the principle of the equivalence of\r\nweight and distance still holds, precisely as in an actual lever,\r\nand while the pressure that may be exerted with slight expenditure\r\nof energy is enormous, the distance through which this pressure acts\r\nis correspondingly small. If, for example, the piston of the force\r\npump has an area of one square inch, while the piston of the press\r\nhas an area of several square feet, the pressure exerted will be\r\nmeasured in tons, but the distance through which it is exerted will be\r\nalmost infinitesimal. The range of utility of the hydrostatic press\r\nis, therefore, limited, but within its sphere, it is an incomparable\r\ntransmitter of energy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDRAULIC PRESS AND HYDRAULIC CAPSTAN.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure shows Bramah's original hydraulic pump and press,\r\nnow preserved in the South Kensington Museum, London. The machine was\r\nconstructed in 1796 by Joseph Bramah to demonstrate the principle of\r\nhis hydraulic press. The discrepancy in size between the small lever\r\nworked by hand and the enormous lever carrying a heavy weight gives a\r\nvivid impression of the gain in power through the use of the apparatus.\r\nThe lower figure shows the hydraulic capstan used on many modern ships,\r\nin which the same principle is utilized.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is possible to reverse the action of the hydraulic\r\napparatus so as to gain motion at the expense of power. A familiar type\r\nof elevator is a case in point. The essential feature of the hydraulic\r\nelevator consists of a ram attached to the bottom of the elevator and\r\nextending down into a cylinder, slightly longer than the height to\r\nwhich the elevator is to rise. The ram is fitting into a cylinder with\r\nwater-tight packing, or a cut leather valve. Water under high pressure\r\nis admitted to the cylinder through the valve at the bottom, and the\r\npressure thus supplied pushes up the ram, carrying the elevator with\r\nit, of course. Another valve allows the water to escape, so that ram\r\nand elevator may descend, too rapid descent being prevented by the\r\npartial balancing of ram and elevator with weights acting over pulleys.\r\nThe ram, to the end of which pressure is thus applied, need be but a\r\nfew inches in diameter. Water pressure is secured by bringing water\r\nfrom an elevation. Such an elevator acts slowly, but is a very safe\r\nand in many ways satisfactory mechanism. Such elevators are still used\r\nextensively in Europe, but have been almost altogether displaced in\r\nAmerica by the electric elevator.\r\n\r\nThe hydraulic elevator just described is virtually a water engine, the\r\nram acting as piston. A veritable engine, of small size, to perform\r\nany species of mechanical work, may be constructed on precisely the\r\nsame principle, the piston in this case acting in a cylinder similar to\r\nthat of the ordinary steam engine. Such an engine operates slowly but\r\nwith great power. It has special utility where it is desirable to apply\r\npower intermittently, as in various parts of a dockyard, or in handling\r\nguns and ammunition on shipboard. In the former case in particular,\r\nit is often inconvenient to use steam power, as steam sent from a\r\ncentral boiler condenses in a way to interfere with its operation. In\r\nsuch a case any number of small water-pressure engines may be operated\r\nfrom a single tank where water is at a high elevation, or where the\r\nrequisite pressure is secured artificially. In the latter case, the\r\nwater is kept under pressure by a large piston or ram heavily weighted,\r\nthe entire receptacle being, of course, of water-tight construction\r\nand adapted to withstand pressure. The pump that supplies the tank is\r\nordinarily made to work automatically, ceasing operation as soon as the\r\nram rises to the top of the receptacle, and beginning again whenever,\r\nthrough use of water, the ram begins to descend. Such an apparatus is\r\ncalled an accumulator. Such water engines have come into vogue only in\r\ncomparatively recent times, being suggested by the steam engine. As\r\nalready pointed out, their utility is restricted, yet the total number\r\nof them in actual use to-day is large, and their share in the world's\r\nwork is not altogether inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nCAPTIVE MOLECULES: THE STORY OF THE STEAM ENGINE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe come now to that all-important transformer of power, the steam\r\nengine. Everybody knows that steam is a state of water in which,\r\nunder the influence of heat, the molecules have broken away from the\r\nmutual attraction of cohesion, and are flying about at inconceivable\r\nspeed, rebounding from one another after collision, in virtue of their\r\nelasticity, exerting in the aggregate an enormous pressure in every\r\ndirection. It is this consideration of the intimate character of steam\r\nthat justifies the title of the present chapter; a title that has\r\nfurther utility as drawing a contrast between the manner of working\r\nwith which we are now to be concerned, and the various types of workers\r\nthat we have previously considered.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the animal machine and of work accomplished by the air\r\nand the water, we have been concerned primarily with masses of matter,\r\npossessing and transmitting energy. Of course molecules--since they\r\nmake up the substance of all matter--could not be altogether ignored,\r\nbut in the main we have had to do with molar rather than with molecular\r\nmotion. Now, however, we are concerned with a mechanism in which the\r\nmolecular activities are directly concerned in performing work.\r\n\r\nEven in the aggregate the molecules make up a mere intangible gas,\r\nwhich requires to be closely confined in order that its energy may be\r\nmade available. Once the molecules have performed their work, they\r\nare so changed in their activities that they sink back, as it were,\r\nexhausted, into a relatively quiescent state, which enables their\r\nlatent cohesive forces to reduce them again to the state of a liquid.\r\nIn a word, we are concerned with the manifestation of energy which\r\ndepends upon molecular activities in a way quite different from what\r\nhas been the case with any of the previously considered mechanisms.\r\nThe tangible manifestation of energy which we term heat is not merely\r\na condition of action and a by-product, as it was in the case of\r\nthe animal machine; it is the essential factor upon which all the\r\nefficiency of the mechanism depends.\r\n\r\nIt should perhaps be stated that this explanation of the action of\r\nthe steam engine is a comparatively modern scientific interpretation.\r\nThe earlier experimenters brought the steam engine to a high state of\r\nefficiency, without having any such conception as this of the nature\r\nof steam itself. For practical purposes it suffices to note that water\r\nwhen heated takes the form of steam; that this steam has the property\r\nof powerful and indefinite expansion; and thirdly, that when allowed to\r\nescape from a state of pressure, sudden expansion of the steam cools it\r\nsufficiently to cause the recondensation of part of its substance, thus\r\ncreating a vacuum.\r\n\r\nStated in few words, the entire action of the steam depends upon these\r\nsimple mechanical principles. The principles are practically applied\r\nby permitting the steam to enter the cylinder where it can act on\r\na piston, to which it gives the thrust that is transmitted to an\r\nexternal mechanism by means of a rod attached to the piston. When the\r\npiston has been driven to the end of the desired thrust, the valve is\r\nopened automatically, permitting the steam to escape, thus producing a\r\nvacuum, and insuring the return thrust of the piston, which is further\r\nfacilitated, ordinarily, by the admission of steam to the other side\r\nof the piston. Practical operation of this mechanism is familiar to\r\neveryone, though the marvel of its power and efficiency seems none the\r\nless because of its familiarity.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that this relatively simple device, in its\r\nfirst general application, marked one of the most important turning\r\npoints in the history of civilization. To its influence, more than to\r\nany other single cause, must be ascribed the revolutionary change that\r\ncame over the character of practical life in the nineteenth century.\r\nFrom prehistoric times till well toward the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, there was scarcely any important change in carrying out the\r\nworld's work. And in the few generations that have since elapsed, the\r\nentire aspect of the mechanical world has been changed, the working\r\nefficiency of the individual has been largely increased; mechanical\r\ntasks have become easy which hitherto were scarcely within the range of\r\nhuman capacity.\r\n\r\nBefore we go on to the detailed study of the machine which has produced\r\nthese remarkable results, it is desirable to make inquiry as to the\r\nhistorical development of so important an invention.\r\n\r\nThe practical steam engine in its modern form dates, as just mentioned,\r\nfrom the latter part of the eighteenth century, and was perfected by\r\nJames Watt, who is commonly thought of as being its inventor. In point\r\nof fact, however, the history of most inventions is duplicated here, as\r\non examination it appears that various forerunners of Watt had been on\r\nthe track of the steam engine, and some of them, indeed, had produced a\r\nworkable machine of no small degree of efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe very earliest experiments were made away back in the Alexandrian\r\ndays in the second century before the Christian era, the experimenter\r\nbeing the famous Hero, whose work in an allied field was referred to\r\nin the preceding chapter. Hero produced--or at least described and so\r\nis credited with producing, though the actual inventor may have been\r\nCtesibius--a little toy mechanism, in which a hollow ball was made to\r\nrevolve on an axis through the agency of steam, which escaped from\r\ntwo bent tubes placed on opposite sides of the ball, their orifices\r\npointing in opposite directions. The apparatus had no practical\r\nutility, but it sufficed to establish the principle that heat, acting\r\nthrough the agency of steam, could be made to do mechanical work. Had\r\nnot the age of Hero been a time of mental stasis, it is highly probable\r\nthat the principle he had thus demonstrated would have been applied\r\nto some more practical mechanism in succeeding generations. As it\r\nwas, however, nothing practical came of his experiment, and the steam\r\nturbine engine was remembered only as a scientific toy.\r\n\r\nNo other worker continued the experiments, so far as is known, until\r\nthe time of the great Italian, Leonardo da Vinci, who, late in the\r\nfifteenth century, gave a new impulse to mechanical invention. Leonardo\r\nexperimented with steam, and succeeded in producing what was virtually\r\nan explosion engine, by the agency of which a ball was propelled along\r\nthe earth. But this experiment also failed to have practical result.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF MODERN DISCOVERY\r\n\r\nSuch sporadic experiments as these have no sequential connection with\r\nthe story of the evolution of the steam engine. The experiments which\r\nled directly on to practical achievements were not begun until the\r\nseventeenth century. In the very first year of that century, an Italian\r\nnamed Giovanni Battista della Porta published a treatise on pneumatics,\r\nin which the idea of utilizing steam for the practical purpose of\r\nraising water was expressly stated. The idea of this inventor was put\r\ninto effect in 1624 by a French engineer and mathematician, Solomon de\r\nCaus. He invented two different machines, the first of which required a\r\nspherical boiler having an internal tube reaching nearly to the bottom;\r\na fire beneath the boiler produced steam which would force the water in\r\nthe boiler to a height proportional to the pressure obtained. In the\r\nother machine, steam is led from the boiler into the upper part of a\r\nclosed cistern containing water to be elevated. To the lower portion of\r\nthe cistern a delivery pipe was attached so that water was discharged\r\nunder a considerable pressure. This arrangement was precisely similar\r\nto the apparatus employed by Hero of Alexandria in various of his\r\nfountains, as regards the principle of expanding gas to propel water.\r\nAn important difference, however, consists in the fact that the\r\nscheme of della Porta and of de Caus embodied the idea of generating\r\npressure with the aid of steam, whereas Hero had depended merely on the\r\nexpansive property of air compressed by the water itself.\r\n\r\nWhile these mechanisms contained the germ of an idea of vast\r\nimportance, the mechanisms themselves were of trivial utility. It is\r\nnot even clear whether their projectors had an idea of the properties\r\nof the condensation of vapor, upon which the working of the practical\r\nsteam engine so largely depends. This idea, however, was probably\r\ngrasped about half a century later by an Englishman, Edward Somerset,\r\nthe celebrated Marquis of Worcester, who in 1663 described in his\r\n_Century of Inventions_ an apparatus for raising water by the expansive\r\nforce of steam. His own account of his invention is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"An admirable and most forcible way to drive up water by fire; not by\r\ndrawing or sucking it upwards, for that must be as the philosopher\r\ncalleth it, _intra sphæram activitatis_, which is but at such a\r\ndistance. But this way hath no bounder, if the vessel be strong enough:\r\nfor I have taken a piece of whole cannon, whereof the end was burst,\r\nand filled it three-quarters full of water, stopping and screwing up\r\nthe broken end, as also the touch-hole; and making a constant fire\r\nunder it, within twenty-four hours it burst and made a great crack; so\r\nthat having a way to make my vessels so that they are strengthened by\r\nthe force within them, and the one to fill after the other, I have seen\r\nthe water run like a constant stream, forty feet high: one vessel of\r\nwater, rarefied by fire, driveth up forty of cold water; and the man\r\nthat tends the work is but to turn two cocks, that one vessel of water\r\nbeing consumed, another begins to force and refill with cold water,\r\nand so successively; the fire being tended and kept constant, which\r\nthe self-same person may likewise abundantly perform in the interim,\r\nbetween the necessity of turning the said cocks.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the Marquis did not give a more elaborate\r\ndescription of this remarkable contrivance. The fact that he treats it\r\nso casually is sufficient evidence that he had no conception of the\r\npossibilities of the mechanism; but, on the other hand, his description\r\nsuffices to prove that he had gained a clear notion of, and had\r\nexperimentally demonstrated, the tremendous power of expansion that\r\nresides in steam. No example of his steam pump has been preserved, and\r\nhistorians of the subject have been left in doubt as to some details\r\nof its construction, and in particular as to whether it utilized the\r\nprinciple of a vacuum created through condensation of the steam.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SAVERY'S STEAM PUMP\r\n\r\nThis principle was clearly grasped, however, by another Englishman,\r\nThomas Savery, a Cornish mine captain, who in 1698 secured a patent for\r\na steam engine to be applied to the raising of water, etc. A working\r\nmodel of this machine was produced before the Royal Society in 1699.\r\nThe transactions of the Society contain the following: \"June 14th,\r\n1699, Mr. Savery entertained the Royal Society with showing a small\r\nmodel of his engine for raising water by help of fire, which he set to\r\nwork before them: the experiment succeeded according to expectation,\r\nand to their satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\nThe following very clear description of Savery's engine is given in the\r\nintroduction to Beckmann's _History of Inventions_:\r\n\r\n\"This engine, which was used for some time to a considerable extent for\r\nraising water from mines, consisted of a strong iron vessel shaped like\r\nan egg, with a tube or pipe at the bottom, which descended to the place\r\nfrom which the water was to be drawn, and another at the top, which\r\nascended to the place to which it was to be elevated. This oval vessel\r\nwas filled with steam supplied from a boiler, by which the atmospheric\r\nair was first blown out of it. When the air was thus expelled and\r\nnothing but pure steam left in the vessel, the communication with the\r\nboiler was cut off, and cold water poured on the external surface. The\r\nsteam within was thus condensed and a vacuum produced, and the water\r\ndrawn up from below in the usual way by suction. The oval vessel was\r\nthus filled with water; a cock placed at the bottom of the lower pipe\r\nwas then closed, and steam was introduced from the boiler into the\r\noval vessel above the surface of the water. This steam being of high\r\npressure, forced the water up the ascending tube, from the top of\r\nwhich it was discharged, and the oval vessel being thus refilled with\r\nsteam, the vacuum was again produced by condensation, and the same\r\nprocess was repeated. By using two oval steam vessels, which would act\r\nalternately--one drawing water from below, while the other was forcing\r\nit upwards, an uninterrupted discharge of water was produced. Owing to\r\nthe danger of explosion, from the high pressure of the steam which was\r\nused, and from the enormous waste of heat by unnecessary condensation,\r\nthese engines soon fell into disuse.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS SAVERY'S STEAM ENGINE.\r\n\r\nThe principle involved is that of the expansion of steam exerting a\r\npropulsive force and its subsequent condensation to produce a vacuum.\r\nThese are the principles employed in the modern steam engine, but the\r\nonly use to which they were put in Savery's engine was the elevation of\r\nwater by suction.]\r\n\r\nThis description makes it obvious that Savery had the clearest\r\nconception of the production of a vacuum by the condensation of steam,\r\nand of the utilization of the suction thus established (which suction,\r\nas we know, is really due to the pressure of outside air) to accomplish\r\nuseful work. Savery also arranged this apparatus in duplicate, so that\r\none vessel was filling with water while the other was forcing water\r\nto the delivery pipe. This is credited with being the first useful\r\napparatus for raising water by the combustion of fuel. There was a\r\ngreat waste of steam, through imparting heat to the water, but the\r\nfeasibility of the all-important principle of accomplishing mechanical\r\nlabor with the aid of heat was at last demonstrated.\r\n\r\nAs yet, however, the experimenters were not on the track of the\r\nmethod by which power could be advantageously transferred to outside\r\nmachinery. An effort in quite another direction to accomplish this\r\nhad been made as early as 1629 by Giovanni Branca, an Italian\r\nmathematician, who had proposed to obtain rotary motion by allowing\r\na jet of steam to blow against the vanes of a fan wheel, capable of\r\nturning on an axis. In other words, he endeavored to utilize the\r\nprinciple of the windmill, the steam taking the place of moving air.\r\nThe idea is of course perfectly feasible, being indeed virtually that\r\nwhich is employed in the modern steam turbine; but to put the idea\r\ninto practise requires special detailed arrangements of steam jet and\r\nvanes, which it is not strange the early inventor failed to discover.\r\nHis experiments appear not to have been followed up by any immediate\r\nsuccessor, and nothing practical came of them, nor was the principle\r\nwhich he had attempted to utilize made available until long after a\r\nform of steam engine utilizing another principle for the transmission\r\nof power had been perfected.\r\n\r\n\r\nDENIS PAPIN INVENTS THE PISTON ENGINE\r\n\r\nThe principle in question was that of causing expanding steam to press\r\nagainst a piston working tightly in a cylinder, a principle, in short,\r\nwith which everyone is familiar nowadays through its utilization in\r\nthe ordinary steam engine. The idea of making use of such a piston\r\nappears to have originated with a Frenchman, Denis Papin, a scientific\r\nworker, who, being banished from his own country, was established as\r\nprofessor of mathematics at the University of Marburg. He conceived the\r\nimportant idea of transmitting power by means of a piston as early as\r\n1688, and about two years later added the idea of producing a vacuum in\r\na cylinder, by cooling the cylinder,--the latter idea being, as we have\r\njust seen, the one which Savery put into effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAMS OF EARLY ATTEMPTS TO UTILIZE THE POWER OF\r\nSTEAM. GIOVANNI BRANCA 1629 GUILLAUME AMONTONS 1699 Two attempts\r\nto give rotation to a mechanical apparatus through the action of\r\nheated air or steam. Nothing practical came of either effort, but the\r\nmechanisms depicted are of historical interest.]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that Papin's invention antedated that of Savery; to\r\nthe Frenchman, therefore, must be given the credit of hitting upon two\r\nimportant principles which made feasible the modern steam engine. Papin\r\nconstructed a model consisting of a small cylinder in which a solid\r\npiston worked. In the cylinder beneath the piston was placed a small\r\nquantity of water, which, when the cylinder was heated, was turned\r\ninto steam, the elastic force of which raised the piston. The cylinder\r\nwas then cooled by removing the fire, when the steam condensed, thus\r\ncreating a vacuum in the cylinder, into which the piston was forced by\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSuch an apparatus seems crude enough, yet it incorporates the essential\r\nprinciples, and required but the use of ingenuity in elaborating\r\ndetails of the mechanism, to make a really efficient steam engine.\r\nIt would appear, however, that Papin was chiefly interested in the\r\ntheoretical, rather than in the really practical side of the question,\r\nand there is no evidence of his having produced a working machine of\r\npractical power, until after such machines worked by steam had been\r\nconstructed elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS NEWCOMEN'S IMPROVED ENGINE\r\n\r\nAs has happened so often in other fields, Englishmen were the first\r\nto make practical use of the new ideas. In 1705 Thomas Newcomen, a\r\nblacksmith or ironmonger, and John Cawley, a plumber and glazier,\r\npatented their atmospheric engine, and five years later, in the year\r\n1710, namely, Newcomen had on the market an engine which is described\r\nin the _Report of the Department of Science and Arts of the South\r\nKensington Museum_, as \"the first real pumping engine ever made.\"\r\n\r\nThe same report describes the engine as \"a vertical steam cylinder\r\nprovided with a piston connected at one end of the beam, having a\r\npivot or bearing in the middle of its length, and at the other end of\r\nthe beam pump rods for working the pump. The cylinder was surrounded\r\nby a second cylinder or jacket, open at the top, and cold water could\r\nbe supplied to this outer cylinder at pleasure. The single or working\r\ncylinder could be supplied with steam when desired from a boiler below\r\nit. There was a drain pipe from the bottom of the working cylinder,\r\nand one from the outer cylinder. For the working of the engine steam\r\nwas admitted to the working cylinder, so as to fill it and expel all\r\nthe air, the piston then being at the top, owing to the weight of the\r\npump rods being sufficient to lift it; then the steam was shut off and\r\nthe drain cocks closed and cold water admitted to the outer cylinder,\r\nso that the steam in the working cylinder condensed, and, leaving a\r\npartial vacuum of pressure of the atmosphere, forced the piston down\r\nand drew up the pump rods, thus making a stroke of the pump. Then the\r\nwater was drawn off from the outer cylinder and steam admitted to the\r\nworking cylinder before allowing the piston to return to the top of its\r\nstroke, ready for the next down stroke.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this machine adopts the principle, with only\r\na change of mechanical details, of the Papin engine just described. A\r\nlater improvement made by Newcomen did away with the outer cylinder\r\nfor condensing the steam, employing instead an injection of cold water\r\ninto the working cylinder itself, thus enabling the engine to work more\r\nquickly. It is said that the superiority of the internal condensing\r\narrangement was accidentally discovered through the improved working\r\nof an engine that chanced to have an exceptionally leaky piston or\r\ncylinder. Many engines were made on this plan and put into practical\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nAnother important improvement was made by a connection from the beam\r\nto the cocks or valves, so that the engine worked automatically,\r\nwhereas in the first place it had been necessary to have a boy or man\r\noperate the valves,--a most awkward arrangement, in the light of modern\r\nimprovements. As the story is told, the duty of opening and closing\r\nthe regulating and condensing valves was intrusted to boys called\r\ncock boys. It is said that one of these boys named Humphrey Potter\r\n\"wishing to join his comrades at play without exposing himself to the\r\nconsequences of suspending the performance of the engine, contrived, by\r\nattaching strings of proper length to the levers which governed the two\r\ncocks, to connect them with the beam, so that it should open and close\r\nthe cocks as it moved up and down with the most perfect regularity.\"\r\n\r\nThis story has passed current for almost two centuries, and it has been\r\nused to point many a useful moral. It seems almost a pity to disturb\r\nso interesting a tradition, yet it must have occurred to more than one\r\niconoclast that the tale is almost too good to be true. And somewhat\r\nrecently it has been more than hinted that Desaguliers, with whom the\r\nstory originated, drew upon his imagination for it. A print is in\r\nexistence, made so long ago as 1719, representing an engine erected\r\nby Newcomen at Dudley Castle, Staffordshire, in 1712, in which an\r\nautomatic valve gear is clearly shown, proving that the Newcomen engine\r\nwas worked automatically at this early period. That the admirable\r\nstory of the inventive youth, whose wits gave him leisure for play,\r\nmay not be altogether discredited, however, it should be added that\r\nunquestionably some of the early engines had a hand-moved gear, and\r\nthat at least one such was still working in England after the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century. It seems probable, then, that the very first\r\nengines were without the automatic valve gear, and there is no inherent\r\nreason why a quick-witted youth may not have been the first to discover\r\nand remedy the defect.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Report of the Department of Science and Arts of\r\nthe South Kensington Museum: \"The adoption of Newcomen's engine was\r\nrapid, for, commencing in 1711 with the engine at Wolverhampton, of\r\ntwenty-three inch diameter and six foot stroke, they were in common use\r\nin English collieries in 1725; and Smeaton found in 1767 that, in the\r\nneighborhood of Newcastle alone there were fifty-seven at work, ranging\r\nin size from twenty-eight inch to seventy-five inch cylinder diameter,\r\nand giving collectively about twelve hundred horse-power. As Newcomen\r\nobtained an evaporation of nearly eight pounds of water per pound of\r\ncoal, the increase of boiler efficiency since his time has necessarily\r\nbeen but slight, although in other requisites of the steam generator\r\ngreat improvements are noticeable.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MODEL OF THE NEWCOMEN ENGINE.\r\n\r\nThis engine has particular interest not only because it was a practical\r\npumping engine, but also because it was while repairing an engine of\r\nthis type that Watt was led to the experiments that resulted in his\r\nepoch-making discovery.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMING OF JAMES WATT\r\n\r\nThe Newcomen engine had low working efficiency as compared with the\r\nmodern engine; nevertheless, some of these engines are still used in a\r\nfew collieries where waste coal is available, the pressure enabling the\r\nsteam to be generated in boilers unsafe for other purposes. The great\r\nimportance of the Newcomen engine, however, is historical; for it was\r\nwhile engaged in repairing a model of one of these engines that James\r\nWatt was led to invent his plan of condensing the steam, not in the\r\nworking cylinder itself, but in a separate vessel,--the principle upon\r\nwhich such vast improvements in the steam engine were to depend.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to overestimate the importance of the work which Watt\r\naccomplished in developing the steam engine. Fully to appreciate it,\r\nwe must understand that up to this time the steam engine had a very\r\nlimited sphere of usefulness. The Newcomen engine represented the\r\nmost developed form, as we have seen; and this, like the others that\r\nit had so largely superseded, was employed solely for the pumping of\r\nwater. In the main, its use was confined to mines, which were often\r\nrendered unworkable because of flooding. We have already seen that a\r\nconsiderable number of engines were in use, yet their power in the\r\naggregate added but a trifle to man's working efficiency, and the work\r\nthat they did accomplish was done in a most uneconomical manner. Indeed\r\nthe amount of fuel required was so great as to prohibit their use in\r\nmany mines, which would have been valuable could a cheaper means have\r\nbeen found of freeing them from water. Watt's inventions, as we shall\r\nsee, accomplished this end, as well as various others that were not\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nIt was through consideration of the wasteful manner of action of the\r\nsteam engine that Watt was led to give attention to the subject.\r\nThe great inventor was a young man at the University of Glasgow. He\r\nhad previously served an apprenticeship of one year with a maker of\r\nphilosophical instruments in London, but ill health had prevented him\r\nfrom finishing his apprenticeship, and he had therefore been prohibited\r\nfrom practising his would-be profession in Glasgow. Finally, however,\r\nhe had been permitted to work under the auspices of the University;\r\nand in due course, as a part of his official duties, he was engaged\r\nin repairing a model of the Newcomen engine. This incident is usually\r\nmentioned as having determined the line of Watt's future activity.\r\n\r\nIt should be recalled, however, that Watt had become a personal friend\r\nof the celebrated Professor Black, the discoverer of latent heat, and\r\nthe foremost authority in the world, in this period, on the study of\r\npneumatics. Just what share Black had in developing Watt's idea, or\r\nin directing his studies toward the expansive properties of steam,\r\nit would perhaps be difficult to say. It is known, however, that the\r\nsubject was often under discussion; and the interest evinced in it by\r\nBlack is shown by the fact that he subsequently wrote a history of\r\nWatt's inventions.\r\n\r\nIt is never possible, perhaps, for even the inventor himself to re-live\r\nthe history of the growth of an idea in his own mind. Much less is it\r\npossible for him to say precisely what share of his progress has been\r\ndue to chance suggestions of others. But it is interesting, at least,\r\nto recall this association of Watt with the greatest experimenter of\r\nhis age in a closely allied field. Questions of suggestion aside,\r\nit illustrates the technical quality of Watt's mind, making it\r\nobvious that he was no mere ingenious mechanic, who stumbled upon his\r\ninvention. He was, in point of fact, a carefully trained scientific\r\nexperimenter, fully equipped with all the special knowledge of his time\r\nin its application to the particular branch of pneumatics to which he\r\ngave attention.\r\n\r\nThe first and most obvious defect in the Newcomen engine was, as Watt\r\ndiscovered, that the alternating cooling and heating of the cylinder\r\nresulted in an unavoidable waste of energy. The apparatus worked, it\r\nwill be recalled, by the introduction of steam into a vertical cylinder\r\nbeneath the piston, the cylinder being open above the piston to admit\r\nthe air. The piston rod connected with a beam suspended in the middle,\r\nwhich operated the pump, and which was weighted at one end in order\r\nto facilitate the raising of the piston. The steam, introduced under\r\nlow pressure, scarcely more than counteracted the pressure of the air,\r\nthe raising of the piston being largely accomplished by the weight in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nOf course the introduction of the steam heated the cylinder. In order\r\nto condense the steam and produce a vacuum, water was injected, the\r\ncylinder being thereby cooled. A vacuum being thus produced beneath\r\nthe cylinder, the pressure of the air from above thrust the cylinder\r\ndown, this being the actual working agent. It was for this reason\r\nthat the Newcomen engine was called, with much propriety, a pneumatic\r\nengine. The action of the engine was very slow, and it was necessary to\r\nemploy a very large piston in order to gain a considerable power.\r\n\r\nThe first idea that occurred to Watt in connection with the probable\r\nimprovement of this mechanism did not look to the alteration of any of\r\nthe general features of the structure, as regards size or arrangement\r\nof cylinder, piston, or beam, or the essential principle upon which\r\nthe engine worked. His entire attention was fixed on the discovery\r\nof a method by which the loss of heat through periodical cooling of\r\nthe cylinder could be avoided. We are told that he contemplated the\r\nsubject long, and experimented much, before he reached a satisfactory\r\nsolution. Naturally enough his attention was first directed toward the\r\ncylinder itself. He queried whether the cylinder might not be made of\r\nwood, which, through its poor conduction of heat, might better equalize\r\nthe temperature. Experiments in this direction, however, produced no\r\nsatisfactory result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATT'S EARLIEST TYPE OF PUMPING ENGINE.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure shows the ruins of Watt's famous engine \"Old Bess.\"\r\nThe upper figure shows a reconstructed model of the \"Old Bess\" engine.\r\nIt will be noted that the walking beam is precisely of the Newcomen\r\ntype. In fact, the entire engine is obviously only a modification\r\nof the Newcomen engine. It had, however, certain highly important\r\nimprovements, as described in the text.]\r\n\r\nThen at last an inspiration came to him. Why not connect the cylinder\r\nwith another receptacle, in which the condensation of the steam could\r\nbe effected? The idea was a brilliant one, but neither its originator\r\nnor any other man of the period could possibly have realized its vast\r\nand all-comprehending importance. For in that idea was contained the\r\ngerm of all the future of steam as a motive power. Indeed, it scarcely\r\nsuffices to speak of it as the germ merely; the thing itself was\r\nthere, requiring only the elaboration of details to bring it to\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nWatt immediately set to work to put his brilliant conception of the\r\nseparate condenser to the test of experiment. He connected the cylinder\r\nof a Newcomen engine with a receptacle into which the steam could be\r\ndischarged after doing its work on the piston. The receptacle was\r\nkept constantly cooled by a jet of water, this water and the water\r\nof condensation, together with any air or uncondensed steam that\r\nmight remain in the receptacle, being constantly removed with the\r\naid of an air pump. The apparatus at once demonstrated its practical\r\nefficiency,--and the modern steam engine had come into existence.\r\n\r\nIt was in the year 1765, when Watt was twenty-nine years old, that he\r\nmade his first revolutionary experiment, but his first patents were\r\nnot taken out until 1769, by which time his engine had attained a\r\nrelatively high degree of perfection. In furthering his idea of keeping\r\nthe cylinder at an even temperature, he had provided a covering for it,\r\nwhich might consist of wood or other poorly conducting material, or a\r\nso-called jacket of steam--that is to say, a portion of steam admitted\r\ninto the closed chamber surrounding the cylinder. Moreover, the\r\ncylinder had been closed at the top, and a portion of steam admitted\r\nabove the piston, to take the place of the atmosphere in producing the\r\ndown stroke. This steam above the piston, it should be explained, did\r\nnot connect with the condensing receptacle, so the engine was still\r\nsingle-acting; that is to say it performed work only during one stroke\r\nof the piston. A description of the mechanism at this stage of its\r\ndevelopment may best be given in the words of the inventor himself, as\r\ncontained in his specifications in the application for patent on his\r\nimprovements in 1769.\r\n\r\n\"My method of lessening the consumption of steam, and consequently\r\nfuel, in fire-engines, consists of the following principles:\r\n\r\n\"First, That vessel in which the powers of steam are to be employed to\r\nwork the engine, which is called the cylinder in common fire-engines,\r\nand which I call the steam vessel, must, during the whole time the\r\nengine is at work, be kept as hot as the steam that enters it; first\r\nby enclosing it in a case of wood, or any other materials that\r\ntransmit heat slowly; secondly, by surrounding it with steam or other\r\nheated bodies; and, thirdly, by suffering neither water nor any other\r\nsubstance colder than the steam to enter or touch it during that time.\r\n\r\n\"Secondly, In engines that are to be worked wholly or partially\r\nby condensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed in vessels\r\ndistinct from the steam vessels or cylinders, although occasionally\r\ncommunicating with them; these vessels I call condensers; and, whilst\r\nthe engines are working, these condensers ought at least to be kept as\r\ncold as the air in the neighborhood of the engines, by application of\r\nwater or other cold bodies.\r\n\r\n\"Thirdly, Whatever air or other elastic vapor is not condensed by the\r\ncold of the condenser, and may impede the working of the engine, is to\r\nbe drawn out of the steam vessels or condensers by means of pumps,\r\nwrought by the engines themselves, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"Fourthly, I intend in many cases to employ the expansive force of\r\nsteam to press on the pistons, or whatever may be used instead of them,\r\nin the same manner in which the pressure of the atmosphere is now\r\nemployed in common fire-engines. In cases where cold water can not be\r\nhad in plenty, the engines may be wrought by this force of steam only,\r\nby discharging the steam into the air after it has done its office.\r\n\r\n\"Sixthly, I intend in some cases to apply a degree of cold not capable\r\nof reducing the steam to water, but of contracting it considerably,\r\nso that the engines shall be worked by the alternate expansion and\r\ncontraction of the steam.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, Instead of using water to render the pistons and other parts\r\nof the engine air-and steam-tight, I employ oils, wax, resinous bodies,\r\nfat of animals, quicksilver and other metals in their fluid state.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nROTARY MOTION\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that Watt's engine was at first used exclusively\r\nas an apparatus for pumping. For some time there was no practical\r\nattempt to apply the mechanism to any other purpose. That it might\r\nbe so applied, however, was soon manifest, in consideration of the\r\nrelative speed with which the piston now acted. It was not until 1781,\r\nhowever, that Watt's second patent was taken out, in which devices are\r\ndescribed calculated to convert the reciprocating motion of the piston\r\ninto motion of rotation, in order that the engine might drive ordinary\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be conceded that Watt was himself the originator of the\r\nidea of making the application through the medium of a crank and\r\nfly-wheel such as are now universally employed. But the year before\r\nWatt took out his second patent, another inventor named James Picard\r\nhad patented this device of crank and connecting rod, having, it is\r\nalleged, obtained the idea from a workman in Watt's employ. Whatever\r\nbe the truth as to this point, Picard's patent made it necessary for\r\nWatt to find some alternative device, and after experimenting, he hit\r\nupon the so-called sun and planet gearing, and henceforth this was used\r\non his rotary engines until the time for the expiration of Picard's\r\npatent, after which the simpler and more satisfactory crank and\r\nfly-wheel were adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Watt had associated himself with a business partner\r\nnamed Boulton, under the firm name of Boulton and Watt. In 1776 a\r\nspecial act of legislation extending the term of Watt's original patent\r\nfor a period of twenty-five years had been secured. All infringements\r\nwere vigorously prosecuted, and the inventor, it is gratifying to\r\nreflect, shared fully in the monetary proceeds that accrued from his\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATT'S ROTATIVE ENGINE.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure shows the earliest type of mechanism through which\r\nWatt applied his engine to other uses than that of pumping. The\r\nso-called sun-and-planet gearing, through which rotary motion was\r\nattained, is seen at the lower right-hand corner of the figure. The\r\nupper figure shows a later and much improved type of the Watt engine,\r\nin which the sun-and-planet gearing has been supplanted by a simple\r\ncrank.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the early recognition of the possibility of securing\r\nrotary motion with Watt's perfected Newcomen engine, it was long\r\nbefore the full possibilities of the application of this principle\r\nwere realized, even by the most practical of machinists. Watt himself\r\napparently appreciated the possibilities no more fully than the\r\nothers, as the use of his famous engines \"Beelzebub\" and \"Old Bess\"\r\nin the establishment of Boulton and Watt amply testifies. It appears\r\nthat Boulton had been an extensive manufacturer of ornamental metal\r\narticles. To drive his machinery at Soho he employed two large water\r\nwheels, twenty-four feet in diameter and six feet wide. These sufficed\r\nfor his purpose under ordinary conditions, but in dry weather from\r\nsix to ten horses were required to aid in driving the machinery. When\r\nWatt's perfected engine was available, however, this was utilized to\r\npump water from the tail race back to the head race, that it might be\r\nused over and over. \"Old Bess\" had a cylinder thirty-three inches in\r\ndiameter with seven-foot stroke, operating a pump twenty-four inches\r\nin diameter; it therefore had remarkable efficiency as a pumping\r\napparatus. But of course it utilized, at best, only a portion of the\r\nworking energy contained in the steam; and the water wheels in turn\r\ncould utilize not more than fifty per cent. of the store of energy\r\nwhich the pump transferred to the water in raising it. Therefore, such\r\nuse of the steam engine involved a most wasteful expenditure of energy.\r\n\r\nIt was long, however, before the practical machinists could be made to\r\nbelieve that the securing of direct rotary power from the piston could\r\nbe satisfactorily accomplished. It was only after the introduction of\r\nhigher speed and heavier fly-wheels, together with improved governors,\r\nthat the speed of rotation was so equalized as to meet satisfactorily\r\nthe requirements of the practical engineer, and ultimately to displace\r\nthe wasteful method of securing rotary motion indirectly through the\r\naid of pump and water wheel. It may be added, that the centrifugal\r\ngovernor, with which modern engines are provided to regulate their\r\nspeed, was the invention of Watt himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINAL IMPROVEMENTS AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES\r\n\r\nIn the year 1782 Watt took out patents which contained specifications\r\nfor the two additional improvements that constituted his final\r\ncontribution to the production of the steam engine. The first of these\r\nprovided for the connection of the cylinder chamber on each side of the\r\npiston with the condenser, so that the engine became double acting. The\r\nsecond introduced the very important principle,--from the standpoint of\r\neconomy in the use of steam--of shutting off the supply of steam from\r\nthe cylinder while the piston has only partially traversed its thrust,\r\nand allowing the remainder of the thrust to be accomplished through\r\nthe expansion of the steam. The application of the first of these\r\nprinciples obviously adds greatly to the efficiency of the engine, and\r\nin practise it was found that the application of the second principle\r\nproduces a very great saving in steam, and thus adds materially to the\r\neconomical working of the engine.\r\n\r\nAll of Watt's engines continued to make use of the walking beam\r\nattached to the piston for the transmission of power; and engineers\r\nwere very slow indeed to recognize the fact that in many--in fact in\r\nmost--cases this contrivance may advantageously be done away with. The\r\nrecognition of this fact constitutes one of the three really important\r\nadvances that have been made in the steam engine since the time of\r\nWatt. The other two advances consist of the utilization of steam under\r\nhigh pressure, and of the introduction of the principle of the compound\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nNeither of these ideas was unknown to Watt, since the utilization\r\nof steam under high pressure was advocated by his contemporary,\r\nTrevithick, while the compound engine was invented by another\r\ncontemporary named Hornblower. Perhaps the very fact that these rival\r\ninventors put forward the ideas in question may have influenced Watt\r\nto antagonize them; in particular since his firm came into legal\r\nconflict with each of the other inventors. At any rate, Watt continued\r\nto the end of his life to be an ardent advocate of low pressure for\r\nthe steam engine, and his firm even attempted to have laws passed\r\nmaking it illegal--on the ground of danger to human life--to utilize\r\nhigh-pressure steam, such as employed by Trevithick.\r\n\r\nPossibly the conservatism of increasing age may also have had its\r\nshare in rendering Watt antagonistic to the new ideas; for he was\r\nsimilarly antagonistic to the idea of applying steam to the purposes\r\nof locomotion. Trevithick, among others, had, as we shall see in due\r\ncourse, made such application with astonishing success, producing\r\na steam automobile which traversed the highway successfully. In\r\nhis earlier years Watt had conceived the same idea, and had openly\r\nexpressed his opinion that the steam engine might be used for this\r\npurpose. But late in life he was so antipathetic to the idea that he\r\nis said to have put a clause in the lease of his house, providing that\r\nno steam carriage should under any pretext be allowed to approach it.\r\n\r\nThese incidents have importance as showing--as we shall see illustrated\r\nagain and again in other fields--the disastrous influence in retarding\r\nprogress that may be exercised by even the greatest of scientific\r\ndiscoverers, when authority well earned in earlier years is exercised\r\nin an unfortunate direction later in life. But such incidents as\r\nthese are inconsequential in determining the position among the\r\nworld's workers of the man who was almost solely responsible for the\r\ntransformation of the steam engine from an expensive and relatively\r\nineffective pumping apparatus, to the great central power that has ever\r\nsince moved the major part of the world's machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME IMPORTANCE OF WATT\r\n\r\nIt is speaking well within bounds to say that no other invention\r\nwithin historical times has had so important an influence upon the\r\nproduction of property--which, as we have seen, is the gauge of the\r\nworld's work--as this invention of the steam engine. We have followed\r\nthe history of that invention in some detail, because of its supreme\r\nimportance. To the reader who was not previously familiar with that\r\nhistory, it may seem surprising that after a lapse of a little over\r\na century one name and one alone should be popularly remembered in\r\nconnection with the invention; whereas in point of fact various workers\r\nhad a share in the achievement, and the man whose name is remembered\r\nwas among the last to enter the field. We have seen that the steam\r\nengine existed as a practical working machine several decades before\r\nWatt made his first invention; and that what Watt really accomplished\r\nwas merely the perfecting of an apparatus which already had attained a\r\nconsiderable measure of efficiency.\r\n\r\nThere would seem, then, to be a certain lack of justice in ascribing\r\nsupreme importance to Watt in connection with the steam engine. Yet\r\nthis measure of injustice we shall find, as we examine the history of\r\nvarious inventions, to be meted always by posterity in determining the\r\nstatus of the men whom it is pleased to honor. One practical rule, and\r\none only, has always determined to whom the chief share of glory shall\r\nbe ascribed in connection with any useful invention.\r\n\r\nThe question is never asked as to who was the originator of the idea,\r\nor who made the first tentative efforts towards its utilization,--or,\r\nif asked by the historical searcher, it is ignored by the generality of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nSo far as the public verdict, which in the last resort determines\r\nfame, is concerned, the one question is, Who perfected the apparatus\r\nso that it came to have general practical utility? It may be, and\r\nindeed it usually is the case, that the man who first accomplished the\r\nfinal elaboration of the idea, made but a comparatively slight advance\r\nupon his predecessors; the early workers produced a machine that was\r\n_almost_ a success; only some little flaw remained in their plans. Then\r\ncame the perfecter, who hit upon a device that would correct this last\r\ndefect,--and at last the mechanism, which hitherto had been only a\r\ncuriosity, became a practical working machine.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the steam engine, it might be said that even a smaller\r\nfeat than this remained to be accomplished when Watt came upon the\r\nscene; since the Newcomen engine was actually a practical working\r\napparatus. But the all-essential thing to remember is that this\r\nNewcomen engine was used for a single purpose. It supplied power for\r\npumping water, and for nothing else. Neither did it have possibilities\r\nmuch beyond this, until the all-essential modification was suggested by\r\nWatt, of exhausting its steam into exterior space.\r\n\r\nThis modification is in one sense a mere detail, yet it illustrates\r\nonce more the force of Michelangelo's famous declaration that trifles\r\nmake perfect; for when once it was tested, the whole practical\r\ncharacter of the steam engine was changed. From a wasteful consumer of\r\nfuel, capable of running a pump at great expense, it became at once a\r\nrelatively economical user of energy, capable of performing almost any\r\nmanner of work.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, its possibilities in this direction were not\r\nimmediately realized, in theory or in practise; yet the conquest that\r\nit made of almost the entire field of labor resulted in the most\r\nrapid transformation of industrial conditions that the world has ever\r\nexperienced. After all, then, there is but little injustice in that\r\npublic verdict which remembers James Watt as the inventor, rather than\r\nas the mere perfecter, of the steam engine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERSONALITY OF JAMES WATT\r\n\r\nThe man who occupies this all-important position in the industrial\r\nworld demands a few more words as to his personality. His work we have\r\nsufficiently considered, but before we pass on to the work of his\r\nsuccessors, it will be worth our while to learn something more of the\r\nestimate placed upon the man himself. Let us quote, then, from some\r\nrecords written by men who were of the same generation.\r\n\r\n\"Independently of his great attainments in mechanics, Mr. Watt was\r\nan extraordinary and in many respects a wonderful man. Perhaps no\r\nindividual in his age possessed so much, or remembered what he had read\r\nso accurately and well. He had infinite quickness of apprehension, a\r\nprodigious memory, and a certain rectifying and methodizing power of\r\nunderstanding which extracted something precious out of all that was\r\npresented to it. His stores of miscellaneous knowledge were immense,\r\nand yet less astonishing than the command he had at all times over\r\nthem. It seemed as if every subject that was casually started in\r\nconversation had been that which he had been last occupied in studying\r\nand exhausting; such was the copiousness, the precision, and the\r\nadmirable clearness of the information which he poured out upon it\r\nwithout effort or hesitation. Nor was this promptitude and compass of\r\nknowledge confined, in any degree, to the studies connected with his\r\nordinary pursuits.\r\n\r\n\"That he should have been minutely and extensively skilled in\r\nchemistry, and the arts, and in most of the branches of physical\r\nscience, might, perhaps, have been conjectured; but it could not have\r\nbeen inferred from his usual occupations, and probably is not generally\r\nknown, that he was curiously learned in many branches of antiquity,\r\nmetaphysics, medicine, and etymology, and perfectly at home in all\r\nthe details of architecture, music, and law. He was well acquainted,\r\ntoo, with most of the modern languages, and familiar with their most\r\nrecent literature. Nor was it at all extraordinary to hear the great\r\nmechanician and engineer detailing and expounding, for hours together,\r\nthe metaphysical theories of the German logicians, or criticizing the\r\nmeasures or the matter of the German poetry.\r\n\r\n\"It is needless to say, that with those vast resources, his\r\nconversation was at all times rich and instructive in no ordinary\r\ndegree. But it was, if possible, still more pleasing than wise, and\r\nhad all the charms of familiarity, with all the substantial treasures\r\nof knowledge. No man could be more social in his spirit, less assuming\r\nor fastidious in his manners, or more kind and indulgent towards\r\nall who approached him. His talk, too, though overflowing with\r\ninformation, had no resemblance to lecturing, or solemn discoursing;\r\nbut, on the contrary, was full of colloquial spirit and pleasantry.\r\nHe had a certain quiet and grave humor, which ran through most of his\r\nconversation, and a vein of temperate jocularity, which gave infinite\r\nzest and effect to the condensed and inexhaustible information which\r\nformed its main staple and characteristic. There was a little air of\r\naffected testiness, and a tone of pretended rebuke and contradiction,\r\nwhich he used towards his younger friends, that was always felt by\r\nthem as an endearing mark of his kindness and familiarity, and prized\r\naccordingly, far beyond all the solemn compliments that proceeded from\r\nthe lips of authority. His voice was deep and powerful; though he\r\ncommonly spoke in a low and somewhat monotonous tone, which harmonized\r\nadmirably with the weight and brevity of his observations, and set off\r\nto the greatest advantage the pleasant anecdotes which he delivered\r\nwith the same grave tone, and the same calm smile playing soberly on\r\nhis lips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES WATT.]\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing of effort, indeed, or of impatience, any more than\r\nof pride or levity, in his demeanor; and there was a finer expression\r\nof reposing strength, and mild self-possession in his manner, than we\r\never recollect to have met with in any other person. He had in his\r\ncharacter the utmost abhorrence for all sorts of forwardness, parade,\r\nand pretension; and indeed never failed to put all such impostors out\r\nof countenance, by the manly plainness and honest intrepidity of his\r\nlanguage and deportment.\r\n\r\n\"He was twice married, but has left no issue but one son, associated\r\nwith him in his business and studies, and two grandchildren by a\r\ndaughter who predeceased him. He was fellow of the Royal Societies both\r\nof London and Edinburgh, and one of the few Englishmen who were elected\r\nmembers of the National Institute of France. All men of learning and\r\nof science were his cordial friends; and such was the influence of his\r\nmild character, and perfect fairness and liberality, even upon the\r\npretender to these accomplishments, that he lived to disarm even envy\r\nitself, and died, we verily believe, without a single enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nTHE MASTER WORKER\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out at some length that, in the hands of Watt,\r\nthe steam engine came at once to be a relatively perfect apparatus, and\r\nthat only three really important modifications have been applied to it\r\nsince the day of its great perfecter. These modifications, as already\r\nnamed, are the doing away with the walking beam, the utilization of\r\nhigh pressure steam, and the development of the compound engine. Each\r\nof these developments requires a few words of explanation.\r\n\r\nThe retention of the heavy walking beam for so long a time after the\r\nsteam engine of Watt had been applied to the various purposes of\r\nmachinery, illustrates the power of a pre-conceived idea. With the\r\nNewcomen engine this beam was an essential, since it was necessary\r\nto have a weight to assist in raising the piston. But with the\r\nintroduction of steam rather than air as the actual power to push the\r\npiston, and in particular with the elaboration of the double-chamber\r\ncylinder, with steam acting equally on either side of the piston, the\r\nnecessity for retaining this cumbersome contrivance no longer existed.\r\nYet we find all the engines made by Watt himself, and nearly all those\r\nof his contemporaries, continuing to utilize this means of transmitting\r\nthe power of the piston. Even the road locomotive, as illustrated by\r\nthat first wonderful one of Trevithick's and such colliery locomotives\r\nas \"Puffing Billy\" and \"Locomotion,\" utilized the same plan. It was not\r\nuntil almost a generation later that it became clear to the mechanics\r\nthat in many cases, indeed in most cases, this awkward means of\r\ntransmitting power was really a needlessly wasteful one, and that with\r\nthe aid of fly-wheel and crank-shaft the thrust of the piston might be\r\ndirectly applied to the wheel it was destined to turn, quite as well as\r\nthrough the intermediary channel of the additional lever.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the beam has, indeed, still commended it for certain\r\npurposes, notably for the propulsion of side-wheel steamers, such as\r\nthe familiar American ferryboat. But aside from such exceptional uses,\r\nthe beam has practically passed out of existence.\r\n\r\nThere was no new principle involved in effecting this change. It was\r\nmerely another illustration of the familiar fact that it is difficult\r\nto do things simply. As a rule, inventors fumble for a long time with\r\nroundabout and complex ways of doing things, before a direct and simple\r\nmethod occurs to them. In other words, the highest development often\r\npasses from the complex to the simple, illustrating, as it were, an\r\noscillation in the great law of evolution. So in this case, even so\r\ngreat an inventor as Watt failed to see the utility of doing away with\r\nthe cumbersome structure which his own invention had made no longer\r\na necessity, but rather a hindrance to the application of the steam\r\nengine. However, a new generation, no longer under the thraldom of\r\nthe ideas of the great inventor, was enabled to make the change,\r\ngradually, but in the end effectively.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH-PRESSURE STEAM\r\n\r\nAs regards the use of steam under high pressure, somewhat the same\r\nremarks apply, so far as concerns the conservatism of mankind, and\r\nthe influence which a great mind exerts upon its generation. Just why\r\nWatt should have conceived an antagonism to the idea of high-pressure\r\nsteam is not altogether clear. It has been suggested, indeed, that\r\nthis might have been due to the fact that a predecessor of Watt had\r\ninvented a high-pressure engine which did not use the principle of\r\ncondensation, but exhausted the steam into open space. As early as\r\n1725, indeed, Leupold in his _Theatrum Machinarum_, had described\r\nsuch a non-condensing engine, which, had it been made practically\r\nuseful, would have required a high pressure of steam. Partly through\r\nthe influence of this work, perhaps, there came to be an association\r\nbetween the words high pressure and non-condensing, so that these terms\r\nare considered to be virtually synonymous; and since Watt's great\r\ncontribution consisted of an application of the idea of condensation,\r\nhe was perhaps rendered antagonistic to the idea of high pressure,\r\nthrough this psychological suggestion. In any event, the antagonism\r\nunquestionably existed in his mind; though it has often enough been\r\npointed out that this seems the more curious since high-pressure steam\r\nwould so much better have facilitated the application of that other\r\nfamous idea of Watt, the use of the expansive property of steam.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, however, the influence of Watt led to experiments\r\nin high-pressure steam through an indirect channel. The contemporary\r\ninventor, Trevithick, in connection with his partner, Bull, had made\r\ndirect-acting pumping engines with an inverted cylinder, fixed in line\r\nwith the pump rod, and actually dispensing with the beam. But as these\r\nengines used a jet of cold water in the exhaust pipe to condense the\r\nsteam, Boulton and Watt brought suit successfully for infringement of\r\ntheir patent, and thus prevented Trevithick from experimenting further\r\nin that direction. He was obliged, therefore, to turn his attention to\r\na different method, and probably, in part at least, in this way was\r\nled to introduce the non-condensing, relatively high-pressure engine.\r\nThis was used about the year 1800. At the same time somewhat similar\r\nexperiments were made by Oliver Evans in America.\r\n\r\nBoth Trevithick and Evans applied their engines to the propulsion of\r\nroad vehicles; and Trevithick is credited with being the first man\r\nwho ran a steam locomotive on a track,--a feat which he accomplished\r\nas early as the year 1804. We are not here concerned with the details\r\nof this accomplishment, which will demand our attention in a later\r\nchapter, when we come to discuss the entire subject of locomotive\r\ntransportation. But it is interesting to recall that the possibilities\r\nof the steam engine were thus early realized, even though another\r\ngeneration elapsed before they were finally demonstrated to the\r\nsatisfaction of the public. It is particularly interesting to note that\r\nin his first locomotive engine, Trevithick allowed the steam exhaust\r\nto escape into the funnel of the engine to increase the draught,--an\r\nexpedient which was so largely responsible for Stephenson's success\r\nwith his locomotive twenty years later, and which retains its utility\r\nin the case of the most highly developed modern locomotive.\r\n\r\nTrevithick was, however, entirely subordinated by the great\r\ninfluence of Watt, and the use of high pressure was in consequence\r\ndiscountenanced by the leading mechanical engineers of England for some\r\ndecades. Meantime, in America, the initiative of Evans led to a much\r\nearlier general use of high-pressure steam. In due course, however, the\r\nadvantages of steam under high pressure became evident to engineers\r\neverywhere, and its conquest was finally complete.\r\n\r\nThe essential feature of super-heated steam is that it contains, as\r\nthe name implies, an excess of heat beyond the quantity necessary to\r\nproduce mere vaporization, and that the amount of water represented\r\nin this vapor is not the maximum possible under given conditions. In\r\nother words, the vapor is not saturated. It has been already explained\r\nthat the amount of vapor that can be taken up in a given space under a\r\ngiven pressure varies with the temperature of the space. Under normal\r\nconditions, when a closed space exists above a liquid, evaporation\r\noccurs from the surface of the liquid until the space is saturated,\r\nand no further evaporation can occur so long as the temperature and\r\npressure are unchanged. If now the same space is heated to a higher\r\ndegree, more vapor will be taken up until again the point of saturation\r\nis attained. But, obviously, if the space were disconnected with the\r\nliquid, and then heated, it would acquire a capacity to take up more\r\nvapor, and so long as this capacity was latent, the vapor present would\r\nexist in a super-heated condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD IDEAS AND NEW APPLIED TO BOILER CONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure shows Robert Trevithick's famous boiler, used in\r\noperating his locomotive about the year 1804. The original is preserved\r\nin the South Kensington Museum, London. The upper figure shows a modern\r\ntubular boiler, by way of contrast.]\r\n\r\nIt will be understood from what has been said before, that with all\r\naccessions of heat, the expansive power of the vapor is increased,--its\r\nmolecules becoming increasingly active; hence one of the very obvious\r\nadvantages of super-heated steam for the purpose of pushing a piston.\r\nThere are other advantages, however, which are not at first sight\r\nso apparent, having to do with the properties of condensation. To\r\nunderstand these, we must pay heed for a few moments to the changes\r\nthat take place in steam itself in the course of its passage through\r\nthe cylinder, where it performs its work upon the piston.\r\n\r\nMany of these changes were not fully understood by the earlier\r\nexperimenters, including Watt. Indeed the theory of the steam engine,\r\nor rather the general theory of the heat engine, was not worked out\r\nuntil the year 1824, when the Frenchman Carnot took the subject in\r\nhand, and performed a series of classical experiments, which led to a\r\nnearly complete theoretical exposition of the subject. It remained,\r\nhowever, for the students of thermo-dynamics, about the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, with Clausius and Rankine at their head, to perfect\r\nthe theory of the steam engine, and the general subject of the mutual\r\nrelations of heat and mechanical work.\r\n\r\nWe are not here concerned with any elaboration of details, but merely\r\nwith a few of the essential principles which enter practically into\r\nthe operation of the steam engine. It appears, then, that when steam\r\nenters the cylinder and begins to thrust back the piston of the steam\r\nengine, a portion of the steam is immediately condensed on the walls\r\nof the cylinder, owing to the fact that previous condensation of steam\r\nhas cooled these walls to a certain extent. We have already pointed\r\nout that Watt endeavored in his earlier experiments to overcome this\r\ndifficulty, by equalizing the temperature of the cylinder walls to the\r\ngreatest practicable extent.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his efforts, however, and those of numberless later\r\nexperimenters, it still remains true that under ordinary conditions,\r\nparticularly if steam enters the cylinder at the saturation point,\r\na very considerable condensation occurs. Indeed this may amount to\r\nfrom thirty to fifty per cent. of the entire bulk of water contained\r\nin the quantity of steam that enters the cylinder. This condensation\r\nobviously militates against the expansive or working power of the\r\nsteam. But now as the steam expands, pushing forward the cylinder, it\r\nbecomes correspondingly rarefied, and immediately a portion of the\r\ncondensed steam becomes again vaporized, and in so doing it takes up\r\na certain amount of heat and renders it latent. This disadvantageous\r\ncycle of molecular transformations is very much modified in the case of\r\nsuper-heated steam, for the obvious reason that such steam may be very\r\nmuch below the saturation point, and hence requires a very much greater\r\nlowering of temperature in order to produce condensation of any portion\r\nof its mass. Without elaborating details, it suffices to note that in\r\nall highly efficient modern engines, steam is employed at a relatively\r\nhigh pressure, and that sometimes this pressure becomes enormous.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND ENGINES\r\n\r\nAs to the compound engine, that also, as has been pointed out, was\r\ninvented by a contemporary of Watt, Jonathan Hornblower by name, whose\r\npatent bears date of 1781. In Hornblower's engine, steam was first\r\nadmitted to a small cylinder, and then, after performing its work on\r\nthe piston, was allowed to escape, not into a condensing receptacle,\r\nbut into a larger cylinder where it performed further work upon another\r\npiston. This was obviously an instance of the use of steam expansively,\r\nand it has been pointed out that, in consequence, Hornblower was\r\nthe first to make use of this idea in practise, although it is said\r\nthat Watt's experiments had even at that time covered this field.\r\nThe application of the idea to the movement of the second cylinder,\r\nhowever, appears to have been original with Hornblower. Certainly it\r\nowed nothing to Watt, who refused to accept the idea, and continued\r\nthroughout his life to frown upon the compound engine.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the device had great utility, as subsequent experiments\r\nwere very fully to demonstrate. The compound engine was revived by\r\nWoolf in 1804, and his name rather than Hornblower's is commonly\r\nassociated with it. The latter experimenter demonstrated that the\r\ncompound engine has two important merits as against the simple engine.\r\nOne of these is that the sum of the two forces exerted by the joint\r\naction results in a more even and continuous pressure throughout the\r\ncycle than could be accomplished by the action of a single cylinder.\r\n\r\nTo understand this it must be recalled that when using the expansive\r\nproperty of steam, the piston thrust could not possibly be uniform,\r\nsince the greatest pressure exerted by the steam would be exerted at\r\nthe moment before it was shut off from the boiler, and its pressure\r\nmust then decrease progressively, as it exerts more and more work upon\r\nthe piston and becomes more expanded, thus obviously retaining less\r\nelastic energy. The operation of the fly-wheel largely compensates\r\nthis difference of pressure in practise, but it would be obviously\r\nadvantageous could the pressure be equalized; and, as just stated, the\r\ncompound engine tends to produce this result.\r\n\r\nThe second, and perhaps the more important merit of the compound\r\nengine is, that it is found in practise to keep the cylinders at a\r\nmore uniform temperature. A moment's reflection makes it clear why\r\nthis should be the case, since in a single-cylinder engine the exhaust\r\nconnects with the cool condenser, whereas in the compound engine the\r\nexhaust from the first cylinder connects with the second cylinder at\r\nonly slightly lower temperature.\r\n\r\nIn many modern engines a third cylinder and sometimes even a fourth\r\nis added, constituting what are called respectively triple-expansion\r\nand quadruple-expansion engines. The triple-expansion system is very\r\ngenerally employed, especially where it is peculiarly desirable to\r\neconomize fuel, as, for example, in the case of ships.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPOUND ENGINES.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure illustrates the use of a modern compound engine,\r\ndirectly operating the propeller shaft of a steamship. The middle\r\nfigure shows a similarly direct application of power to the axes of\r\npaddle wheels. The upper figure shows the application of power through\r\na walking beam similar in principle to that of the original Newcomen\r\nand Watt engines.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROTARY ENGINES\r\n\r\nAll these improvements, it will be observed, have to do with details\r\nthat do not greatly modify the steam engine from the original type. The\r\ncylinder with its closely fitting piston, as introduced in the Newcomen\r\nengine, is retained and constitutes the essential mechanism through\r\nwhich the energy of steam is transferred into mechanical energy. But\r\nfrom a comparatively remote period the idea has prevailed that it might\r\nbe possible to utilize a different principle; that, in short, if the\r\nsteam instead of being made to press against a piston were allowed\r\nto rush against fan-like blades, adjusted to an axle, it might cause\r\nblades and axle to revolve, precisely as a windmill is made to revolve\r\nby the pressure of the wind, or the turbine wheel by the pressure of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn a word, it has been believed that a turbine engine might be\r\nconstructed, which would utilize the energy of the steam as\r\nadvantageously as it is utilized in the piston engine, and at the same\r\ntime would communicate its power as a direct rotation, instead of as a\r\nstraight thrust that must be translated into a rotary motion by means\r\nof a crank or other mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, James Watt himself invented such an engine, and\r\npatented it in 1782, though there is no evidence that he ever\r\nconstructed even a working model. His patent specifications show \"a\r\npiston in the form of a closely-fitting radial arm, projecting from an\r\naxial shaft in a cylinder. An abutment, arranged as a flap is hinged\r\nnear a recess in the side of the cylinder, and swings while remaining\r\nin contact with the piston. Steam is admitted to the chamber on one\r\nside of the flap, and so causes an unbalanced pressure upon the radial\r\narm.\"\r\n\r\nThis arrangement has been re-invented several times. Essentially the\r\nsame principle is utilized by Joshua Routledge, whose name is well\r\nknown in connection with the engineer's slide-rule. A model of this\r\nengine is preserved in the South Kensington Museum, and the apparatus\r\nis described in the catalogue of the Museum as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The piston revolves on a shaft passing through the centre of the\r\ncylinder casing. The flap or valve hinged to the casing, with its free\r\nend resting upon the piston, acts like the bottom of an ordinary engine\r\ncylinder. The steam inlet port is on one side of the hinge, and the\r\nexhaust port on the other. The admission of steam is controlled by a\r\nside valve, actuated by an eccentric on the fly-wheel shaft, so that\r\nthe engine could work expansively, and the steam pressure resisting the\r\nlifting of the flap would also be greatly reduced, so diminishing the\r\nknock at this point, which, however, would always be a serious cause\r\nof trouble. The exhaust steam passes down to a jet condenser, provided\r\nwith a supply of water from a containing tank, from which the injection\r\nis admitted through a regulating valve. The air pump, which draws the\r\nair and water from the condenser and discharges them through a pipe\r\npassing out at the end of the tank, is a rotary machine constructed\r\nlike the engine and driven by spur gearing from the fly-wheel shaft.\r\nSome efforts have been made to prevent leakage by forming grooves in\r\nthe sides of the revolving piston and filling them with soft packing.\"\r\n\r\nSundry other rotary engines, some of them actual working models, are\r\nto be seen at the South Kensington Museum. There is, for example, one\r\ninvented by the Rev. Patrick Bell, a gentleman otherwise known to fame\r\nas one of the earliest inventors of a practical reaping machine. In\r\nthis apparatus, \"A metal disc is secured to a horizontal axis carried\r\nin bearings, and the lower half of the disc is enclosed by a chamber\r\nof circular section having its axis a semi-circle. One end of this\r\nchamber is closed and provided with a pipe through which steam enters,\r\nthe exhaust taking place through the open end. The disc is provided\r\nwith three holes, each fitted with a circular plate turning on an\r\naxis radial to the disc, and these plates when set at right angles\r\nto the disc become pistons in the lower enclosing chamber. Toothed\r\ngearing is arranged to rotate these pistons into the plane of the disc\r\non leaving the cylinder and back again immediately after entering,\r\nlocking levers retaining them in position during the intervals. The\r\nsteam pressure upon these pistons forces the disc round, but the engine\r\nis non-expansive, and although some provision for packing has been\r\nmade, the leakage must have been considerable and the wear and tear\r\nexcessive.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated that almost the same arrangement was proposed by Lord\r\nArmstrong in 1838 as a water motor, and that a model subsequently\r\nconstructed gave over five horse-power at thirty revolutions per\r\nminute, with an efficiency of ninety-five per cent.\r\n\r\nAnother working model of a rotary engine shown at the Museum is one\r\nloaned by Messrs. Fielding and Platt in 1888. \"The action of this\r\nengine depends upon the oscillating motion which the cross of a\r\nuniversal joint has relative to the containing jaws when the system is\r\nrotated.\r\n\r\n\"Two shafts are set at an angle of 165 deg. to each other and connected\r\nby a Hooke's joint; one serves as a pivot, the power being taken from\r\nthe other. Four curved pistons are arranged on the cross-piece, two\r\npointing towards one shaft and two towards the other, and on each\r\nshaft or jaw are formed two curved steam cylinders in which the curved\r\npistons work. The steam enters and leaves the base of each cylinder\r\nthrough ports in the shaft, which forms a cylindrical valve working in\r\nthe bearing as a seating.\r\n\r\n\"On the revolution of the shafts the pistons reciprocate in their\r\ncylinders in much the same way as in an ordinary engine, and the\r\nvalve arrangement is such that while each piston is receding from its\r\ncylinder the steam pressure is driving it, and during the in-stroke\r\nof each, its cylinder is in communication with the exhaust. There are\r\nthus four single-acting cylinders making each a double stroke for one\r\nrevolution of the driving-shaft. The engine has no dead centres, and\r\nhas been at 1,000 revolutions per minute.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROTARY ENGINES.\r\n\r\nThe three types of rotary engines here shown are similar in principle,\r\nand none of them is of great practical value, though the upper figure\r\nshows an engine that has met with a certain measure of commercial\r\nsuccess.]\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to describe other of the rotary engines that have\r\nbeen made along more or less similar lines by numerous inventors,\r\nmodels of which are for the most part, as in the case of those just\r\ndescribed, to be seen more commonly in museums than in practical\r\nworkshops. Reference may be made, however, to a rotary engine\r\nwhich was invented by a Mr. Hoffman, of Buffalo, New York, about the\r\nbeginning of the twentieth century, an example of which was put into\r\nactual operation in running the machinery of a shop in Buffalo, in 1905.\r\n\r\nThis engine consists of a solid elliptical shaft of steel, fastened to\r\nan axle at one side of its centre, which axis is also the shaft of the\r\ncylinder, which revolves about the central ellipse in such a way that\r\nat one part of the revolution the cylinder surface fits tightly against\r\nthe ellipse, while the opposite side of the cylinder supplies a free\r\nchamber between the ellipse and the cylinder walls. Running the length\r\nof the cylinder are two curved pieces of steel, like longitudinal\r\nsections of a tube. These flanges are adjusted at opposite sides of\r\nthe cylinder and so arranged that their sides at all times press\r\nagainst the ellipse, alternately retreating into the substance of the\r\ncylinder, and coming out into the free chamber. Steam is admitted to\r\nthe free chamber through one end of the shaft of ellipse and cylinder\r\nand exhausted through the other end. The pressure of the steam against\r\nfirst one end and then the other of the flanges supplies the motive\r\npower. This pressure acts always in one direction, and the entire\r\napparatus revolves, the cylinder, however, revolving more rapidly than\r\nthe central ellipse.\r\n\r\nFor this engine the extravagant claim is made that there is no limit\r\nto its speed of revolution, within the limit of resistance of steel\r\nto centrifugal force. It has been estimated that a locomotive might\r\nbe made to run two hundred or three hundred miles an hour without\r\ndifficulty, with the Hoffman engine. Such estimates, however, are\r\ntheoretical, and it remains to be seen what the engine can do in\r\npractise when applied to a variety of tasks, and what are its\r\nlimitations. Certainly the apparatus is at once ingenious and simple in\r\nprinciple, and there is no obvious theoretical reason why it should not\r\nhave an important future.\r\n\r\n\r\nTURBINE ENGINES\r\n\r\nWhatever the future may hold, however, it remains true that the first\r\npractical solution of the problem of securing direct rotary motion from\r\nthe action of steam, on a really commercial scale, was solved with an\r\napparatus very different from any of those just described, the inventor\r\nbeing an Englishman, Mr. C. A. Parsons, and the apparatus the steam\r\nturbine, the first model of which he constructed in 1884, and which\r\nbegan to attract general attention in the course of the ensuing decade.\r\nPublic interest was fully aroused in 1897, when Mr. Parson's boat, the\r\n_Turbinia_, equipped with engines of this type, showed a trial speed\r\nof 32-3/4 knots per hour, a speed never hitherto attained by any other\r\nspecies of water craft. More recently, a torpedo boat, the _Viper_,\r\nequipped with engines developing about ten thousand horse-power,\r\nattained a speed of 35-1/2 knots. The success of these small boats led\r\nto the equipment of large vessels with the turbine, and on April first,\r\n1905, the first transatlantic liner propelled by this form of engine\r\nsteamed into the harbor of Halifax, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nThis first ocean liner equipped with the turbine engine is called the\r\n_Victorian_. She is a ship five hundred and forty feet long and sixty\r\nfeet wide, carrying fifteen hundred passengers. The _Victorian_ had\r\nshown a speed of 19-1/2 knots an hour on her trial trip, and it had\r\nbeen hoped that she would break the transatlantic record. On her first\r\ntrip, however, she encountered adverse winds and seas, and did not\r\nattain great speed. Her performance was, however, considered entirely\r\nsatisfactory and creditable.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing half-decade several large ships were equipped with\r\nengines of the same type, the most famous of these being the Cunard\r\nliners, _Carmania_, _Lusitania_, and _Mauretania_. The two last-named\r\nships are sister craft, and they are the largest boats of any kind\r\nhitherto constructed. The _Lusitania_ was first launched and she\r\nentered immediately upon a record-breaking career, only to be surpassed\r\nwithin a few months by the _Mauretania_, which soon acquired all\r\nrecords for speed and endurance.\r\n\r\nFuller details as to the performance of these vessels will be found in\r\nanother place. Here we are of course concerned with the Parsons turbine\r\nengine itself rather than with its applications.\r\n\r\nThis turbine engine constitutes the first really important departure\r\nfrom the old-type steam engine, thus realizing the dream of the\r\nseventeenth-century Italian, Branca, to which reference was made\r\nabove. Mr. Parsons' elaboration of the idea developed a good deal of\r\ncomplexity as regards the number of parts involved, yet his engine\r\nis of the utmost simplicity in principle. It consists of a large\r\nnumber of series of small blades, each series arranged about a drum\r\nwhich revolves. Between the rings of revolving blades are adjusted\r\ncorresponding rings of fixed blades, which project from the casing\r\nto the cylinder, and by means of which the steam is regulated in\r\ndirection, so that it strikes at the proper angle against the revolving\r\nblades of the turbine.\r\n\r\nIn practise, three series of cylindrical drums are used, each\r\ncontaining a large number of rings of blades of uniform size; but each\r\nsuccessive drum having longer blades, to accommodate the greater volume\r\nof the expanding steam. The steam is fed against the first series of\r\nblades in gusts, which may be varied in frequency and length to meet\r\nthe requirements of speed. After impinging on the first circle of\r\nblades, the steam passes to the next under slightly reduced pressure,\r\nand the pressure is thus successively stepped down from one set of\r\nblades to another until it is ultimately reduced from say two hundred\r\npounds to the square inch, to one pound to the square inch before it\r\npasses to the condenser and ceases to act.\r\n\r\nThere is thus a fuller utilization of the kinetic energy of the gas,\r\nthrough carrying it from high to low pressure, than is possible with\r\nthe old type of cylinder-and-piston engine. On the other hand, there is\r\na constant loss due to the fact that the blades of the turbine can not\r\nfit with absolute tightness against the cylinder walls. The net result\r\nis that the compound turbine, as at present developed, appears to have\r\nabout the same efficiency as the best engine of the old type.\r\n\r\nOne capital advantage of the turbine is that it keeps the cylinder\r\nwalls at a more uniform temperature than is possible even with a\r\ncompound engine of the old type. Another advantage is that the power\r\nof the turbine is applied directly to cause rotation of the shaft,\r\nwhereas no satisfactory means has ever been discovered hitherto of\r\nmaking the action of the steam engine rotary, except with the somewhat\r\ndisadvantageous crank-shaft. This fact of adjustment of the turbine\r\nblades to the revolving shaft seems to make this form of engine\r\nparticularly adapted to use in steamships. It is also highly adapted\r\nto revolving the shaft of a dynamo, and has been largely applied to\r\nthis use. Needless to say, however, it may be applied to any other\r\nform of machinery. It would be difficult at the present stage of\r\nits development to predict the extent to which the turbine will\r\nultimately supersede the old type of engine. Its progress has already\r\nbeen extraordinary, however, as an engineer pointed out in the London\r\n_Times_ of August 14, 1907, in the following words:\r\n\r\n\"When the steam turbine was introduced by Mr. Parsons some 25 years\r\nago, in the form of a little model, which is now in the South\r\nKensington Museum, and the rotor of which may easily be held stationary\r\nby the hand against the full blast of the steam, who would have been\r\nrash enough to predict, except perhaps the far-seeing inventor himself,\r\nthat a vessel 760 feet long, loaded to 37,000 tons displacement,\r\ndrawing 32 ft. 9 in. of water, and providing accommodation for 2,500\r\npeople, could be propelled at a speed of 24.5 knots per hour, which it\r\nis hoped she may maintain over the 3,000 miles of the Atlantic voyage?\r\n\r\n\"From this small model, which will in time become as historic as the\r\n_Rocket_ of Stephenson, and which is only some few inches in diameter,\r\nthe turbine has been developed gradually in size. The cylindrical\r\ncasings which take the place of the complicated machinery of the\r\npiston engine in the engine room of the _Lusitania_ contain drums,\r\nwhich in the high-pressure turbines are 8 feet in diameter and in the\r\nlow-pressure 11 ft. 8 in., and from which thousands of curved blades\r\nproject, the longest of which are 22 inches, and against which the\r\nsteam impinges in its course from the boiler to the condenser.\r\n\r\n\"Not only has the steam turbine justified the confidence of those who\r\nhave labored so successfully in its development, but no other great\r\ninvention has proceeded from the laboratory stage to such an important\r\nposition in the engineering world in such a short space of time. This\r\nwould not have happened if some inherent drawback, such as lack of\r\neconomy in steam consumption, existed, and as the turbine has been\r\nproved to be, for land purposes, very economical, there seems to be\r\nno reason to doubt that marine turbines, working as they do at full\r\nload almost continually, will show likewise that the coal bill is not\r\nincreased, but perhaps diminished by their use.\r\n\r\n\"The records of the vibrations of the hull which were taken during the\r\ntrials by Schlick's instruments showed that the vertical vibration\r\nwas 60 per minute on the run, which was due to the propellers, and\r\nwhich may be further modified. The horizontal vibration was almost\r\nunnoticeable, while the behavior of the ship in the heavy seas she\r\nencountered in her long-distance runs was good, the roll from side to\r\nside having a period of 18 seconds. The great length of this ship and\r\nthe gyrostatic action of the heavy rotating masses of the machinery\r\nought to render her almost insensible to the heaviest Atlantic rollers;\r\ncertainly as far as pitching is concerned.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ORIGINAL PARSON'S TURBINE ENGINE AND THE\r\nRECORD-BREAKING SHIP FOR WHICH IT IS RESPONSIBLE.\r\n\r\nThis small turbine engine, with which Mr. Parson's early experiments\r\nwere made in 1884, is preserved in the South Kensington Museum, London.\r\nAt the time when it was made it seemed scarcely more than a toy, and\r\nengineers in general doubted that the principle it employed could ever\r\nbe made commercially available. Yet within the lifetime of its inventor\r\nengines built on this model have come to be the most powerful of force\r\ntransmuters. The \"Mauretania,\" the largest, and thanks to her turbine\r\nengines the speediest, of ships, is here presented on the same page\r\nwith the little original turbine model, as illustrating vividly the\r\npractical development of a seemingly visionary idea.]\r\n\r\nA more general comment upon the turbine engine, with particular\r\nreference to its use in America, is made by Mr. Edward H. Sanborn in an\r\narticle on _Motive Power Appliances_, in the Twelfth Census Report of\r\nthe United States, Vol. X. part IV.\r\n\r\n\"Apart from its demonstrated economy,\" says Mr. Sanborn, \"other\r\nimportant advantages are claimed for the steam turbine, some of which\r\nare worthy of brief mention.\r\n\r\n\"There is an obvious advantage in economy of space as compared with\r\nthe reciprocating engine. The largest steam turbine constructed in the\r\nUnited States is one of 3,000 horse-power, which is installed in the\r\npower house of the Hartford Electric Light Company, Hartford, Conn. The\r\ntotal weight of this motor is 28,000 pounds, its length over all is 19\r\nfeet 8 inches, and its greatest diameter six feet. With the generator\r\nto which it is directly connected, it occupies a floor space of 33 feet\r\n3 inches long by 8 feet 9 inches wide.\r\n\r\n\"Friction is reduced to a minimum in the steam turbine, owing to the\r\nabsence of sliding parts and the small number of bearings. The absence\r\nof internal lubrication is also an important consideration, especially\r\nwhen it is desired to use condensers.\r\n\r\n\"As there are no reciprocating parts in a steam turbine, and as a\r\nperfect balance of its rotating parts is absolutely essential to its\r\nsuccessful operation, vibration is reduced to such a small element that\r\nthe simplest foundations will suffice, and it is safe to locate steam\r\nturbines on upper floors of a factory if this be desirable or necessary.\r\n\r\n\"The perfect balance of the moving parts and the extreme simplicity\r\nof construction tend to minimize the wear and increase the life of a\r\nturbine, and at the same time to reduce the chance of interruption\r\nin its operation through derangement of, or damage to, any of its\r\nessential parts.\r\n\r\n\"Although hardly beyond the stage of its first advent in the\r\nmotive-power field, the steam turbine has met with much favor, and\r\nthere is promise of its wide use for the purposes to which it is\r\nparticularly adapted. At present, however, its uses are restricted to\r\nservice that is continuous and regular, its particular adaptability\r\nbeing for the driving of electrical generators, pumps, ventilating\r\nfans, and similar work, especially where starting under load is not\r\nessential.\r\n\r\n\"Steam turbines are now being built in the United States in all sizes\r\nup to 3,000 horse-power. Their use abroad covers a longer period and\r\nhas become more general. The largest turbines thus far attempted\r\nare those of the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company,\r\nof London, embracing four units of 10,000 horse-power each. Several\r\nturbines of large size have been operated successfully in Germany.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be added that the compound turbine wheel of Parsons is not\r\nthe only turbine wheel that has proved commercially valuable. There\r\nis a turbine consisting of a single ring of revolving blades, the\r\ninvention of Dr. Gustav De Laval, which has proved itself capable of\r\ncompeting with the old type of engine. To make this form of single\r\nturbine operate satisfactorily, it is necessary to have steam under\r\nhigh pressure, and to generate a very high speed of revolution. In\r\npractice, the De Laval machines sometimes attain a speed of thirty\r\nthousand revolutions per minute. This is a much higher rate of speed\r\nthan can advantageously be utilized directly in ordinary machinery, and\r\nconsequently the shaft of this machine is geared to another shaft in\r\nsuch a way as to cause the second shaft to revolve much more slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nGAS AND OIL ENGINES\r\n\r\n\r\nJust at the time when the type of piston-and-cylinder engine has thus\r\nbeen challenged, it has chanced that a new motive power has been\r\napplied to the old type of engine, through the medium of heated gas.\r\nThe idea of such utilization of a gas other than water vapor is by no\r\nmeans new, but there have been practical difficulties in the way of the\r\nconstruction of a commercial engine to make use of the expansive power\r\nof ordinary gases.\r\n\r\nThe principle involved is based on the familiar fact that a gas expands\r\non being heated and contracts when cool. Theoretically, then, all that\r\nis necessary is to heat a portion of air confined in a cylinder, to\r\nsecure the advantage of its expansion, precisely as the expansion of\r\nsteam is utilized, by thrusting forward a piston. Such an apparatus\r\nconstitutes a so-called \"caloric\" or hot-air engine. As long ago\r\nas the year 1807 Sir G. Cayley in England produced a motor of this\r\ntype, in which the heated air passed directly from the furnace to the\r\ncylinder, where it did work while expanding until its pressure was not\r\ngreater than that of the atmosphere, when it was discharged. The chief\r\nmechanical difficulty encountered resulted from the necessity for the\r\nemployment of very high temperatures; and for a long time the engine\r\nhad no great commercial utility. The idea was revived, however, about\r\nthree-quarters of a century later and an engine operated on Cayley's\r\nprinciple was commercially introduced in England by Mr. Buckett. This\r\nengine has a cold-air cylinder above the crank-shaft and a large\r\nhot-air cylinder below, while the furnace is on one side enclosed in an\r\nair-tight chamber. The fuel is supplied as required through a valve and\r\ndistributing cone arranged above the furnace and provided with an air\r\nlock in which the fuel is stored. At about the time when this hot-air\r\nengine was introduced, however, gas and oil engines of another and more\r\nimportant type were developed, as we shall see in a moment.\r\n\r\nMeantime, an interesting effort to utilize the expansive property of\r\nheated air was made by Dr. Stirling in 1826; his engine being one\r\nin which heat was distributed by means of a displacer which moved\r\nthe mass of air to and fro between the hot and cold portions of the\r\napparatus. He also compressed the air before heating it, thus making a\r\ndistinct advance in the economy and compactness of the engine. From an\r\nengineering standpoint his design has further interest in that it was\r\na practical attempt to construct an engine working on the principle\r\nof the theoretically perfect heat engine, in which the cycle of\r\noperations is closed, the same mass of air being used throughout. In\r\nthe theoretically perfect heat engine, it may be added, the cycle of\r\noperations may be reversed, there being no loss of energy involved; but\r\nin practice, of course, an engine cannot be constructed to meet this\r\nideal condition, as there is necessarily some loss through dissipation\r\nof heat. Dr. Stirling's practical engine had its uses, but could not\r\ncompete with the steam engine in the general field of mechanical\r\noperations to which that apparatus is applied.\r\n\r\nAnother important practical experimenter in the construction of\r\nhot-air engines was John Ericsson, who in 1824 constructed an engine\r\nsomewhat resembling the early one of Cayley, and in 1852 built caloric\r\nengines on such a scale as to be adapted to the propulsion of ships.\r\nNotwithstanding the genius of Ericsson, however, engines of this\r\ntype did not prove commercially successful on a large scale, and\r\nin subsequent decades the hot-air motors constructed for practical\r\npurposes seldom exceeded one horse-power. Such small engines as\r\nthese are comparatively efficient and absolutely safe, and they are\r\nthoroughly adapted for such domestic purposes as light pumping.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty with all these engines operated with heated air\r\nhas been, as already suggested, that their efficiency of action is\r\nlimited by the difficulties incident to applying high temperatures\r\nto large masses of the gas. There is, however, no objection to the\r\nsuper-heating of small quantities of gas, and it was early suggested\r\nthat this might be accomplished by exploding a gaseous mixture\r\nwithin a cylinder. It was observed by the experimenters of the\r\nseventeenth century that an ordinary gun constitutes virtually an\r\ninternal-combustion engine; and such experimenters as the Dutchman\r\nHuyghens, and the Frenchmen Hautefeuille and Papin, attempted to make\r\npractical use of the power set free by the explosion of gunpowder,\r\ntheir experiments being conducted about the years 1678 to 1689.\r\nTheir results, however, were not such as to give them other than an\r\nhistorical interest. About a century later, in 1794, the Englishman\r\nRobert Street suggested the use of inflammable gases as explosives, and\r\never since that time there have been occasional experimenters along\r\nthat line. In 1823 Samuel Brown introduced a vacuum gas engine for\r\nraising water by atmospheric pressure. The first fairly practical gas\r\nengine, however, was that introduced by J. J. E. Lenoir, who in 1850\r\nproposed an engine working with a cycle resembling that of a steam\r\nengine. His engine patented in 1860 proved to be a fairly successful\r\napparatus. This engine of Lenoir prepared the way for gas engines that\r\nhave since become so enormously important. Its method of action is this:\r\n\r\n\"To start the engine, the fly-wheel is pulled round, thus moving the\r\npiston, which draws into the cylinder a mixture of gas and air through\r\nabout half its stroke; the mixture is then exploded by an electric\r\nspark, and propels the piston to the end of its stroke, the pressure\r\nmeanwhile falling, by cooling and expansion, to that of the atmosphere\r\nwhen exhaust takes place. In the return stroke the process is repeated,\r\nthe action of the engine resembling that of the double-acting steam\r\nengine, and having a one-stroke cycle. The cylinder and covers are\r\ncooled by circulating water. The firing electricity was supplied by two\r\nBunsen batteries and an induction coil, the circuit being completed at\r\nthe right intervals by contact pieces on an insulating disc on the\r\ncrank-shaft; the ignition spark leaped across the space between two\r\nwires carried about one-sixth of an inch apart in a porcelain holder.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Mons. P. Hugon patented an engine similar to that of Lenoir,\r\nexcept that ignition was accomplished by an external flame instead of\r\nby electricity. The ignition flame was carried to and fro in a cavity\r\ninside a slide valve, moved by a cam so as to get a rapid cut-off, and\r\npermanent lights were maintained at the ends of the valve to re-light\r\nthe flame-ports after each explosion. The gas was supplied to the\r\ncylinder by rubber bellows, worked by an eccentric on the crank-shaft.\r\nThis engine could be operated satisfactorily, except as to cost, but\r\nthe heavy gas consumption made it uneconomical.\r\n\r\nAn important improvement in this regard was introduced by the Germans,\r\nHerrn. E. Langen and N. A. Otto, who under patents bearing date of\r\n1866 introduced a so-called \"free\" piston arrangement--that is to say\r\nan arrangement by which the piston depends for its action partly upon\r\nthe momentum of a fly-wheel. This principle had been proposed for a\r\ngas engine as early as 1857, but the first machine to demonstrate its\r\nfeasibility was that of Langen and Otto. Their engine greatly decreased\r\nthe gas consumption and hence came to be regarded as the first\r\ncommercially successful gas engine. It was, however, noisy and limited\r\nto small sizes. The cycle of operations of an engine of this type is\r\ndescribed as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GAS AND OIL ENGINES.\r\n\r\nLower right-hand figure, a very early type of commercially successful\r\ngas engine. It has a \"free\" piston, an arrangement that was first\r\nproposed for a gas engine in 1857, but only brought into practical form\r\nby Langen & Otto under their patent of 1866. Upper figure, the gas\r\nengine patented by Lenoir in 1860, one of the very first practically\r\nsuccessful engines. Lower left-hand figure, a sectional view of a\r\nmodern gas engine of the type used as the motor of the automobile.]\r\n\r\n\"(a) The piston is lifted about one-tenth of its travel by the momentum\r\nof the fly-wheel, thus drawing in a charge of gas and air.\r\n\r\n\"(b) The charge is ignited by flame carried in by a slide valve.\r\n\r\n\"(c) Under the impulse of the explosion, the piston shoots upward\r\nnearly to the top of the cylinder, the pressure in which falls by\r\nexpansion to about 4 lbs. absolute, while absorbing the energy of the\r\npiston.\r\n\r\n\"(d) The piston descends by its own weight and the atmospheric\r\npressure, and in doing so causes a roller-clutch on a spur-wheel\r\ngearing with a rack on the piston-rod to engage, so that the fly-wheel\r\nshaft shall be driven by the piston; during this down-stroke the\r\npressure increases from 4 lbs. absolute to that of the atmosphere, and\r\naverages 7 lbs. per square inch effective throughout the stroke.\r\n\r\n\"(e) When the piston is near the bottom of the cylinder, the pressure\r\nrises above atmospheric, and the stroke is completed by the weight of\r\nthe piston and rack, and the products of combustion are expelled.\r\n\r\n\"(f) The fly-wheel now continues running freely till its speed, as\r\ndetermined by a centrifugal governor, falls below a certain limit when\r\na trip gear causes the piston to be lifted the short distance required\r\nto recommence the cycle.\r\n\r\n\"Ignition is performed by an external gas jet, near a pocket in the\r\nslide valve by which the charge is admitted; this pocket carries flame\r\nto the charge, thus igniting it without allowing any escape. The valve\r\nalso connects the interior of the cylinder with the exhaust pipe,\r\nand a valve in the latter controlled by the governor throttles the\r\ndischarge, and so defers the next stroke until the speed has fallen\r\nbelow normal. To run the engine empty about four explosions per minute\r\nare necessary, and at full power 30 to 35 are made, so that about 28\r\nexplosions per minute are available for useful work under the control\r\nof the governor.\"\r\n\r\nThe definitive improvement in this gas engine was introduced in 1876\r\nby Dr. N. A. Otto, when he compressed the explosive mixture in the\r\nworking cylinder before igniting it. This expedient--so all-important\r\nin its results--had been suggested by William Barnett in 1838, but at\r\nthat time gas engines were not sufficiently developed to make use of\r\nthe idea. Now, however, Dr. Otto demonstrated that by compressing the\r\ngas before exploding it a much more diluted mixture can be fired, and\r\nthat this gives a quieter explosion, and a more sustained pressure\r\nduring the working stroke, while as the engine runs at a high speed the\r\nfly-wheel action is generally sufficient to correct the fluctuations\r\narising from there being but one explosion for four strokes of the\r\npiston.\r\n\r\nIn this perfected engine, then, the method of operation is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe piston is pulled forward with the application of some outside\r\nforce, which in practice is supplied by the inertia of the fly-wheel,\r\nor in starting the engine by the action of a crank with which every\r\nuser of an automobile is familiar. In being pulled forward, the piston\r\ndraws gas into the cylinder; as the piston returns, this gas is\r\ncompressed; the compressed gas, constituting an explosive mixture, is\r\nthen ignited by a piece of incandescent metal or by an electric spark;\r\nthe exploding gas expands, pushing the piston forward, this being the\r\nonly thrust during which work is done; the returning piston expels the\r\nexpanded gas, completing the cycle. Thus there are three ineffective\r\npiston thrusts to one effective thrust. Nevertheless, the engine has\r\nproved a useful one for many purposes.\r\n\r\nThis so-called Otto cycle has been adopted in almost all gas and oil\r\nengines, the later improvements being in the direction of still higher\r\ncompression, and in the substitution of lift for slide valves. There\r\nhas been a steady increase in the size and power of such engines, the\r\nlarge ones usually introducing two or more working cylinders so as to\r\nsecure uniform driving. Cheap forms of gas have been employed such as\r\nthose made by decomposing water by incandescent fuel, and it has been\r\nproved possible thus to operate gas-power plants on a commercial scale\r\nin competition with the most economical steam installations.\r\n\r\nA practical modification of vast importance was introduced when it\r\nwas suggested that a volatile oil be employed to supply the gas for\r\noperation in an internal combustion engine. There was no new principle\r\ninvolved in this idea, and the Otto cycle was still employed as\r\nbefore; but the use of the volatile oil--either a petroleum product\r\nor alcohol--made possible the compact portable engine with which\r\neveryone is nowadays familiar through its use in automobiles and\r\nmotor boats. The oil commonly used is gasoline which is supplied to\r\nthe cylinder through a so-called carburettor in which the vapors of\r\ngasoline are combined with ordinary air to make an explosive mixture.\r\nThe introduction of this now familiar type of motor is to a large\r\nextent due to Herr G. Daimler, who in 1884 brought out a light and\r\ncompact high-speed oil engine. About ten years later Messrs. Panhard\r\nand Levassor devised the form of motor which has since been generally\r\nadopted. Few other forms of mechanisms are better known to the general\r\npublic than the oil engine with its two, four, six, or even eight\r\ncylinders, as used in the modern automobile. As everyone is aware, it\r\nfurnishes the favorite type of motor, combining extraordinary power\r\nwith relative lightness, and making it feasible to carry fuel for a\r\nlong journey in a receptacle of small compass.\r\n\r\nWith the gas engines a complication arises precisely opposite to that\r\nwhich is met with in the case of the cylinder of the steam engine--the\r\ntendency, namely, to overheating of the cylinder. To obviate this it\r\nis customary to have the cylinder surrounded by a water jacket, though\r\nair cooling is used in certain types of machines. About fifty per cent.\r\nof the total heat otherwise available is lost through this unavoidable\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nThe rapid introduction of the gas engine in recent years suggests that\r\nthis type of engine may have a most important future. It has even\r\nbeen predicted that within a few years most trans-Atlantic steamers\r\nwill be equipped with this type of engine, producing their own gas\r\nin transit. It is possible, then, that through this medium the old\r\npiston-and-cylinder engine may retain its supremacy, as against the\r\nturbine. For the moment, at any rate, the gas engine is gaining\r\npopularity, not merely in its application to the automobile, but for\r\nnumerous types of small stationary engines as well.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it will be interesting to quote the report of the\r\nSpecial Agent of the Twelfth Census of the United States, as showing\r\nthe status of gas engines and steam engines in the year 1902.\r\n\r\n\"The decade between 1890 and 1900,\" he says, \"was a period of marked\r\ndevelopment in the use of gas engines, using that term to denote all\r\nforms of internal combustible engines, in which the propelling force\r\nis the explosion of gaseous or vaporous fuel in direct contact with\r\na piston within a closed cylinder. This group embraces those engines\r\nusing ordinary illuminating gas, natural gas, and gas made in special\r\nproducers installed as a part of the power plant, and also vaporised\r\ngasoline or kerosene. This form of power for the first time is an item\r\nof consequence in the returns of the present census, and the very large\r\nincrease in the horse-power in 1900 as compared with 1890 indicates the\r\ngrowing popularity of this class of motive power.\r\n\r\n\"In 1890 the number of gas engines in use in manufacturing plants\r\nwas not reported, but their total power amounted to only 8,930\r\nhorse-power, or one-tenth of one per cent of the total power utilized\r\nin manufacturing operations. In 1900, however, 14,884 gas engines were\r\nreported, with a total of 143,850 horse-power, or 1.3 per cent of the\r\ntotal power used for manufacturing purposes. This increase from 8,930\r\nhorse-power to 143,850 horse-power, a gain of 134,920 horse-power, is\r\nproportionately the largest increase in any form of primary power shown\r\nby a comparison of the figures of the Eleventh and Twelfth censuses,\r\namounting to 1,510.9 per cent.\r\n\r\n\"Within the past decade, and more particularly during the past\r\nfive years, there has been a marked increase in the use of this\r\npower in industrial establishments for driving machinery, for\r\ngenerating electricity, and for other kindred uses. At the same time,\r\ninternal-combustion engines have increased in popularity for uses apart\r\nfrom manufacturing, and the amount of this kind of power in use for all\r\npurposes in 1900 was, doubtless, very much larger than indicated by the\r\nfigures relating to manufacturing plants alone.\r\n\r\n\"The average horse-power per gas engine in 1900 was 9.7 horse-power.\r\nThere are no available statistics upon which to base a comparison of\r\nthis average with the average for 1890, but it is doubtful if there\r\nhas been any very material change in ten years; for while gas engines\r\nare built in much larger sizes than ever before, there has been also a\r\ngreat increase in the number of small engines for various purposes.\r\n\r\n\"The large increase in the use of internal-combustion engines has\r\nbeen due to the rapid improvements that have been made in them, their\r\nincreased efficiency and economy, their decreased cost, and the wider\r\nrange of adaptability that has been made practicable.\r\n\r\n\"Steam still continues to be preeminently the power of greatest\r\nimportance, and the census returns indicate that the proportion of\r\nsteam to the total of all powers has increased very largely in the past\r\nthirty years. In 1870 steam furnished 1,215,711 horse-power, or 51.8\r\nper cent of a total of 2,346,142; in 1880 the amount of steam power\r\nused was 2,185,458 horse-power out of a total of 3,410,837, or 64.1 per\r\ncent; in 1890 out of an aggregate of 5,954,655 horse-power, 4,581,595,\r\nor 76.9 per cent was steam; while in 1900 steam figured to the extent\r\nof 8,742,416 horse-power, or 77.4 per cent, in a total of 11,300,081.\r\nThis increase in thirty years, from 51.8 per cent to 77.4 per cent of\r\nthe total power, shows how much more rapidly the use of steam power has\r\nincreased than other primary sources of power.\r\n\r\n\"The tendency toward larger units in the use of steam power is shown\r\ninadequately by the increase in the average horse-power per engine from\r\n39 horse-power in 1880, to 51 horse-power in 1890, and 56 horse-power\r\nin 1900.\r\n\r\n\"The tendency toward great operations which has been such a conspicuous\r\nfeature of industrial progress during the past ten years, has shown\r\nitself strikingly in the use of units of larger capacity in nearly\r\nevery form of machinery, and nowhere has this tendency been more marked\r\nthan in the motive power by which the machinery is driven. At the same\r\ntime there has been an increase in the use of small units, which tends\r\nto destroy the true tendency in steam engineering in these statistics.\r\nFor example, a steam plant consisting of one or more units of several\r\nthousand horse-power may also embrace a number of small engines of\r\nonly a few horse-power each, the use of which is necessitated by the\r\nmagnitude of the plant, for the operation of mechanical stokers, the\r\ndriving of draft fans, coal and ash conveyors, and other work requiring\r\npower in small units. On this account the average horse-power of steam\r\nengines in use at different census periods fails to afford a true\r\nbasis for measuring progress toward larger units during the past ten\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"Developments of the past few years in the distribution of power by the\r\nuse of electric motors have served to accelerate the tendency toward\r\nlarger steam units and the elimination of small engines in large plants\r\nand to change completely the conditions just described. For example:\r\nIn one of the largest power plants in the world, which is now being\r\ninstalled, all the stokers, blowers, conveyors, and other auxiliary\r\nmachinery are to be driven by electric motors. Such rapidly changing\r\nconditions tend to invalidate any comparisons of statistical averages\r\ndeduced from figures for periods even but a few years apart.\r\n\r\n\"Comparison of two important industries will illustrate the foregoing.\r\nThe average horse-power of the steam engine used in the cotton mills of\r\nthe United States in 1890 was 198, and in 1900 it was 300.\r\n\r\n\"In the iron and steel industry the average horse-power per engine in\r\n1890 was 171, and in 1900 it was 235. In the cotton mills the use of\r\nsingle large units of motive power, with few auxiliary engines of small\r\ncapacity, gives the largest horse-power per engine of any industry;\r\nwhile in the iron and steel industry the average of the motive power\r\nproper, although probably larger than in the manufacture of cotton\r\ngoods, is reduced by the large number of small engines which are used\r\nfor auxiliary purposes in every iron and steel plant.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be understood that the object of exploding the mixed gases in\r\nthe oil engine is to produce sudden heating of the entire gas. There\r\nis no reason whatever for introducing the gasoline beyond this. Could\r\na better method of heating air be devised, the oil might be entirely\r\ndispensed with, and the safety of the apparatus enhanced, as well as\r\nthe economy of operation. Efforts have been made for fifty years to\r\nconstruct a hot-air engine that would compete with steam successfully.\r\nIn the early fifties, as already noted, Ericsson showed the feasibility\r\nof substituting hot air for steam, but although he constructed large\r\nengines, their power was so slight that he was obliged to give up the\r\nidea of competing with steam, and to use his engines for pumping where\r\nvery small power was required.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty was that it was not found practicable to heat\r\nthe air rapidly. All subsequent experimenters have met with the same\r\ndifficulty until somewhat recently. It is now claimed, however, that\r\na means has been found of rapidly heating the air, and it is even\r\npredicted that the hot-air engine will in due course entirely supersede\r\nthe steam engine. Mr. G. Emil Hesse, in an article in _The American\r\nInventor_, for April 15, 1905, describes a Svea caloric engine as\r\nhaving successfully solved the problem of rapidly heating air. The\r\nmethods consist in breaking up the air into thin layers and passing\r\nit over hot plates, where it rapidly absorbs heat. It passes from the\r\nheater to the power cylinder which resembles the cylinder of a steam\r\nengine; thence after expanding and doing its work it is exhausted into\r\nthe atmosphere. Large engines may use the same air over and over again\r\nunder pressure of one hundred pounds per square inch, alternately\r\nheating and cooling it. A six horse-power engine of this type is\r\nsaid to have a cylinder four and one-half inches in diameter and a\r\nstroke of four and seven-eighth inches, and makes four hundred and\r\nfifty revolutions per minute. The heater is twenty inches in diameter,\r\nsixteen inches long, and has a heating surface of sixty square feet.\r\nThe total weight of heater and engine complete is four hundred pounds\r\nfor a half horse-power Ericsson engine.\r\n\r\n\"The Svea heater,\" says Mr. Hesse, \"absorbs the heat as perfectly\r\nas an ordinary steam boiler, and the heat-radiating surface of both\r\nheater and engine is not larger than that of a steam plant of the same\r\npower, thereby placing the two motors on the same basis, as far as the\r\nutilization of the heat in the fuel itself is concerned.\r\n\r\n\"The advantage which every hot-air engine has over the steam engine is\r\nthe amount of heat saved in the vaporization of the water. It is now\r\nwell known that one gas is as efficient as another for the conversion\r\nof heat into power. Air and steam at 100° C. are consequently on the\r\nsame footing and ready to be superheated. The amount of heat required\r\nto bring the two gases to this temperature is, however, very different.\r\n\r\n\"With an initial temperature of 10° C. for both air and water, we find\r\nthat one kilogram of steam requires 90 + 537 = 627 thermal units,\r\nand one kilogram of air 0.24 × 90 = 21.6 thermal units. Some heat is\r\nrecovered if the feed water is heated and the steam condensed, but\r\nthe difference is still so great as to altogether exclude steam as a\r\ncompetitor, provided air can be as readily handled.\r\n\r\n\"Having now the means to rapidly heat the air, the outlook for the\r\nexternal-combustion engine is certainly very promising.\r\n\r\n\"The saving of more than half the coal now used by the steam engine\r\nwill be of tremendous importance to the whole world.\"\r\n\r\nTo what extent this optimistic prediction will be verified is a problem\r\nfor the future to decide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SMALLEST WORKERS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our studies of the steam engine and gas engine we have been\r\nconcerned with workers of infinitesimal size. Yet, if we are to believe\r\nthe reports of the modern investigator, the molecules of steam or of\r\nignited gas are small only in a relative sense, and there is a legion\r\nof workers compared with which the molecules are really gigantic in\r\nsize. These workers are the atoms, and the yet more minute particles\r\nof which, according to the most recent theories, they are themselves\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\nThese smallest conceivable particles, the constituents of the atoms,\r\nare called electrons. They are a discovery of the physicists of the\r\nmost recent generation. According to the newest theories they account\r\nfor most--perhaps for all--of the inter-molecular and inter-atomic\r\nforces; they are indeed the ultimate repositories of those stores of\r\nenergy which are known to be contained in all matter. The theories\r\nare not quite as fully developed as could be wished, but it would\r\nappear that these minutest particles, the electrons, are the essential\r\nconstituents of the familiar yet wonderful carrier of energy which\r\nwe term electricity. In considering the share of electricity in\r\nthe world's work, therefore, we shall do well at the outset to put\r\nourselves in touch with recent views as to the nature of this most\r\nremarkable of workers.\r\n\r\nOn every side in this modern world we are confronted by this strange\r\nagent, electricity. The word stares us in the face on every printed\r\npage. The thing itself is manifest in all departments of our every-day\r\nlife. You go to your business in an electric car; ascend to your\r\noffice in an electric elevator; utilize electric call-bells; receive\r\nand transmit messages about the world and beneath the sea by electric\r\ntelegraph. Your doctor treats you with an electric battery. Your\r\ndentist employs electric drills and electric furnaces. You ride in\r\nelectric cabs; eat food cooked on electric stoves; and read with the\r\naid of electric light. In a word, the manifestations of electricity are\r\nso obvious on every side that there can be no challenge to the phrasing\r\nwhich has christened this the Age of Electricity.\r\n\r\nBut what, then, is this strange power that has produced all these\r\nmultifarious results? It would be hard to propound a scientific query\r\nthat has been more variously answered. Ever since the first primitive\r\nman observed the strange effect produced by rubbing a piece of amber,\r\nthoughtful minds must have striven to explain that effect. Ever since\r\nthe eighteenth-century scientist began his more elaborate studies of\r\nelectricity, theories in abundance have been propounded. And yet we\r\nare not quite sure that even the science of to-day can give a correct\r\nanswer as to the nature of electricity. At the very least, however, it\r\nis able to give some interesting suggestions which seem to show that\r\nwe are in a fair way to solve this world-old mystery. And, curiously\r\nenough, the very newest explanations are not so very far away from\r\nsome eighteenth-century theories which for a long time were looked\r\nat askance if not altogether discarded. In particular, the theory of\r\nBenjamin Franklin, which considered electricity as an immaterial fluid\r\nbearing certain curious relations to tangible matter, is found to serve\r\nsingularly well as an aid to the interpretation of the very newest\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN'S ONE-FLUID THEORY\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, we must consider this theory of Franklin's\r\nsomewhat in detail. Perhaps we cannot do better than state the theory\r\nin the words of the celebrated physicist, Dr. Thomas Young, as given\r\nin his work on natural philosophy, published in 1807. By quoting from\r\nthis old work we shall make sure that we are not reading any modern\r\ninterpretations into the theory. \"It is supposed,\" says Young, \"that a\r\npeculiar ethereal fluid pervades the pores, if not the actual substance\r\nof the earth and of all other material bodies, passing through them\r\nwith more or less facility, according to their different powers of\r\nconducting it; that particles of this fluid repel each other, and are\r\nattracted by particles of common matter; that particles of common\r\nmatter also repel each other; and that these attractions and repulsions\r\nare equal among themselves, and vary inversely as to squares of the\r\ndistances of the particles. The effects of this fluid are distinguished\r\nfrom those of all other substances by an attractive or repulsive\r\nquality, which it appears to communicate to different bodies, and\r\nwhich differs in general from other attractions and repulsions by\r\nits immediate diminution or cessation when the bodies, acting on\r\neach other, come into contact, or are touched by other bodies.... In\r\ngeneral, a body is said to be electrified when it contains, either as\r\na whole or in any of its parts, more or less of the electric fluid\r\nthan is natural to it.... In this common neutral state of all bodies,\r\nthe electrical fluid, which is everywhere present, is so distributed\r\nthat the various forces hold each other exactly in equilibrium and\r\nthe separate results are destroyed, unless we choose to consider\r\ngravitation itself as arising from a comparatively slight inequality\r\nbetween the electrical attractions and repulsions.\"\r\n\r\nThe salient and striking feature of this theory, it will be observed,\r\nis that the electrical fluid, under normal conditions, is supposed to\r\nbe incorporated everywhere with the substance of every material in\r\nthe world. It will be observed that nothing whatever is postulated as\r\nto the nature or properties of this fluid beyond the fact that its\r\nparticles repel each other and are attracted by the particles of common\r\nmatter; it being also postulated that the particles of common matter\r\nlikewise repel each other under normal conditions.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Franklin propounded his theory, there was a rival\r\ntheory before the world, which has continued more or less popular ever\r\nsince, and which is known as the two-fluid theory of electricity.\r\nAccording to this theory, there are two uncreated and indestructible\r\nfluids which produce electrical effects. One fluid may be called\r\npositive, the other negative. The particles of the positive fluid are\r\nmutually repellent, as also are the particles of the negative fluid,\r\nbut, on the other hand, positive particles attract and are attracted by\r\nnegative particles. We need not further elaborate the details of this\r\ntwo-fluid theory, because the best modern opinion considers it less\r\nsatisfactory than Franklin's one-fluid theory. Meantime, it will be\r\nobserved that the two theories have much in common; in particular they\r\nagree in the essential feature of postulating an invisible something\r\nwhich is not matter, and which has strange properties of attraction and\r\nrepulsion.\r\n\r\nThese properties of attraction and repulsion constituted in the\r\nearly day the only known manifestations of electricity; and the same\r\nproperties continue to hold an important place in modern studies of\r\nthe subject. Electricity is so named simply because amber--the Latin\r\n_electrum_--was the substance which, in the experience of the ancients,\r\nshowed most conspicuously the strange property of attracting small\r\nbodies after being rubbed. Modern methods of developing electricity\r\nare extremely diversified, and most of them are quite unsuggestive\r\nof the rubbing of amber; yet nearly all the varied manifestations of\r\nelectricity are reducible, in the last analysis, to attractions and\r\nrepulsions among the particles of matter.\r\n\r\nAs to the alleged immaterial fluids which, according to the theories\r\njust mentioned, make up the real substance of electricity, it was\r\nperfectly natural that they should be invented by the physicists of the\r\nelder day. All the conceptions of the human mind are developed through\r\ncontact with the material world; and it is extremely difficult to get\r\naway, even in theory, from tangible realities. When the rubbed amber\r\nacquires the property of drawing the pith ball to it, we naturally\r\nassume that some change has taken place in the condition of the amber;\r\nand since the visible particles of amber appear to be unchanged--since\r\nits color, weight, and friability are unmodified--it seems as if some\r\nimmaterial quality must have been added to, or taken from it. And it\r\nwas natural for the eighteenth-century physicist to think of this\r\nimmaterial something as a fluid, because he was accustomed to think of\r\nlight, heat, and magnetism as being also immaterial fluids. He did not\r\nknow, as we now do, that what we call heat is merely the manifestation\r\nof varying \"modes\" of motion among the particles of matter, and that\r\nwhat we call light is not a thing _sui generis_, but is merely our\r\nrecognition of waves of certain length in the all-pervading ether.\r\nThe wave theory of light had, indeed, been propounded here and\r\nthere by a philosopher, but the theory which regarded light as a\r\ncorpuscular emanation had the support of no less an authority than\r\nSir Isaac Newton, and he was a bold theorist that dared challenge it.\r\nWhen Franklin propounded his theory of electricity, therefore, his\r\nassumption of the immaterial fluid was thoroughly in accord with the\r\nphysical doctrines of the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERN VIEWS\r\n\r\nBut about the beginning of the nineteenth century the doctrine\r\nof imponderable fluids as applied to light and heat was actively\r\nchallenged by Young and Fresnel and by Count Rumford and Humphry Davy\r\nand their followers, and in due course the new doctrines of light and\r\nheat were thoroughly established. In the light of the new knowledge,\r\nthe theory of the electric fluid or fluids seemed, therefore, much\r\nless plausible. Whereas the earlier physicists had merely disputed as\r\nto whether we must assume the existence of two electrical fluids or\r\nof only one, it now began to be questioned whether we need assume the\r\nexistence of any electrical fluid whatever. The physicists of about\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century developed the wonderful doctrine\r\nof conservation of energy, according to which one form of force may be\r\ntransformed into another, but without the possibility of adding to, or\r\nsubtracting from, the original sum total of energy in the universe.\r\nIt became evident that electrical force must conform to this law.\r\nFinally, Clerk-Maxwell developed his wonderful electromagnetic theory,\r\naccording to which waves of light are of electrical origin. The work of\r\nMaxwell was followed up by the German Hertz, whose experiments produced\r\nthose electromagnetic waves which, differing in no respect except in\r\ntheir length from the waves of light, have become familiar to everyone\r\nthrough their use in wireless telegraphy. All these experiments showed\r\na close relation between electrical phenomena, and the phenomena of\r\nlight and of radiant heat, and a long step seemed to be taken toward\r\nthe explanation of the nature of electricity.\r\n\r\nThe new studies associated electricity with the ether, rather than with\r\nthe material substance of the electrified body. Many experiments seemed\r\nto show that electricity in motion traverses chiefly the surface of\r\nthe conductor, and it came to be believed that the essential feature of\r\nthe \"current\" consists of a condition of strain or stress in the ether\r\nsurrounding a conductor, rather than of any change in the conductor\r\nitself. This idea, which is still considered valid, has the merit of\r\ndoing away with the thought of action at a distance--the idea that was\r\nso repugnant to the mind of Faraday.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. But what determines the ether strain? There is\r\nsurely _something_ that is not matter and is not ether. What is this\r\nsomething? The efforts of many of the most distinguished experimenters\r\nhave in recent years been directed toward the solution of that\r\nquestion; and these efforts, thanks to the new methods and new\r\ndiscoveries, have met with a considerable measure of success. I must\r\nnot attempt here to follow out the channels of discovery, but must\r\ncontent myself with stating briefly the results. We shall have occasion\r\nto consider some further details as to the methods in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nBriefly, then, it is now generally accepted, at least as a working\r\nhypothesis, that every atom of matter--be it oxygen, hydrogen, gold,\r\niron, or what not--carries a charge of electricity, which is probably\r\nresponsible for all the phenomena that the atom manifests. This charge\r\nof electricity may be positive or negative, or it may be neutral, by\r\nwhich is meant that the positive and negative charges may just balance.\r\nIf the positive charge has definite carriers, these are unknown except\r\nin association with the atom itself; but the negative charge, on the\r\nother hand, is carried by minute particles to which the name electron\r\n(or corpuscle) has been given, each of which is about one thousand\r\ntimes smaller than a hydrogen atom, and each of which carries uniformly\r\na unit charge of negative electricity.\r\n\r\nElectrons are combined, in what may be called planetary systems, in the\r\nsubstance of the atom; indeed, it is not certain that the atom consists\r\nof anything else but such combinations of electrons, held together\r\nby the inscrutable force of positive electricity. Some, at least, of\r\nthe electrons within the atom are violently active--perhaps whirling\r\nin planetary orbits,--and from time to time one or more electrons may\r\nescape from the atomic system. In thus escaping an electron takes away\r\nits charge of negative electricity, and the previously neutral atom\r\nbecomes positively electrified. Meanwhile the free electron may hurtle\r\nabout with its charge of negative electricity, or may combine with some\r\nneutral atom and thus give to that neutral atom a negative charge.\r\nUnder certain conditions myriads of these electrons, escaped thus from\r\ntheir atomic systems, may exist in the free state. For example, the\r\nso-called _beta_ (ß) rays of radium and its allies consist of such\r\nelectrons, which are being hurtled off into space with approximately\r\nthe speed of light. The cathode rays, of which we have heard so much in\r\nrecent years, also consist of free electrons.\r\n\r\nBut, for that matter, all currents of electricity whatever, according\r\nto this newest theory, consist simply of aggregations of free\r\nelectrons. According to theory, if the electrons are in uniform motion\r\nthey produce the phenomena of constant currents of electricity; if\r\nthey move non-uniformly they produce electromagnetic phenomena (for\r\nexample, the waves used in wireless telegraphy); if they move with\r\nperiodic motion they produce the waves of light. Meanwhile stationary\r\naggregations of electrons produce the so-called electrostatic\r\nphenomena. All the various ether waves are thus believed to be produced\r\nby changes in the motions of the electrons. A very sudden stoppage,\r\nsuch as is produced when the cathode ray meets an impassable barrier,\r\nproduces the X-ray.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations in mind, it will be obvious how closely this\r\nnewest interpretation of electricity corresponds in its general\r\nfeatures with the old one-fluid theory of Franklin. The efforts of\r\nthe present-day physicist have resulted essentially in an analysis of\r\nFranklin's fluid, which gives to this fluid an atomic structure. The\r\nnew theory takes a step beyond the old in suggesting the idea that\r\nthe same particles which make up the electric fluid enter also into\r\nthe composition--perhaps are the sole physical constituents--of every\r\nmaterial substance as well. But while the new theory thus extends\r\nthe bounds of our vision, we must not claim that it fully solves the\r\nmystery. We can visualize the ultimate constituent of electricity as\r\nan electron one thousand times smaller than the hydrogen atom, which\r\nhas mass and inertia, and which possesses powers of attraction and\r\nrepulsion. But as to the actual nature of this ultimate particle we are\r\nstill in the dark. There are, however, some interesting theories as to\r\nits character, which should claim at least incidental attention.\r\n\r\nWe have all along spoken of the electron as an exceedingly minute\r\nparticle, stating indeed, that in actual size it is believed to be\r\nabout one thousand times smaller than the hydrogen atom, which hitherto\r\nhad been considered the smallest thing known to science. But we have\r\nnow to offer a seemingly paradoxical modification of this statement.\r\nIt is true that in _mass_ or weight the electron is a thousand times\r\nsmaller than the hydrogen atom, yet at the same time it may be\r\nconceived that the limits of space which the electron occupies are\r\nindefinitely large. In a word, it is conceived (by Professor J. J.\r\nThomson, who is the chief path-breaker in this field) that the electron\r\nis in reality a sort of infinitesimal magnet, having two poles joined\r\nby lines or tubes of magnetic force (the so-called Faraday tube), which\r\nlines or tubes are of indefinite number and extent; precisely as, on\r\na large scale, our terrestrial globe is such a magnet supplied with\r\nsuch an indefinite magnetic field. That the mass of the electron is so\r\ninfinitesimally small is explained on the assumption that this mass\r\nis due to a certain amount of universal ether which is bound up with\r\nthe tubes where they are thickest; close to the point in space from\r\nwhich they radiate, which point in space constitutes the focus of the\r\ntangible electron.\r\n\r\nIt will require some close thinking on the part of the reader to gain\r\na clear mental picture of this conception of the electron; but the\r\nresult is worth the effort. When you can clearly conceive all matter as\r\ncomposed of electrons, each one of which cobwebs space with its system\r\nof magnetic tubes, you will at least have a tangible picture in mind of\r\na possible explanation of the forces of cohesion and gravitation--in\r\nfact, of all the observed cases of seeming action at a distance. If\r\nat first blush the conception of space as filled with an interminable\r\nmeshwork of lines of force seems to involve us in a hopeless mental\r\ntangle, it should be recalled that the existence of an infinity of such\r\nmagnetic lines joining the poles of the earth may be demonstrated at\r\nany time by the observation of a compass, yet that these do not in any\r\nway interfere with the play of other familiar forces. There is nothing\r\nunthinkable, then, in the supposition that there are myriads of minor\r\nmagnetic centres exerting lesser degrees of force throughout the same\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nAll that can be suggested as to the actual nature of the Faraday\r\ntubes is that they perhaps represent a condition of the ether. This,\r\nobviously, is heaping hypothesis upon hypothesis. Yet it should be\r\nunderstood that the hypothesis of the magnetic electron as the basis of\r\nmatter, has received an amount of experimental support that has raised\r\nit at least to the level of a working theory. Should that theory be\r\ndemonstrated to be true, we shall apparently be forced to conclude not\r\nmerely that electricity is present everywhere in nature, but that, in\r\nthe last analysis, there is absolutely no tangible thing other than\r\nelectricity in all the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ELECTRICITY IS DEVELOPED\r\n\r\nTurning from this very startling theoretical conclusion to the\r\npracticalities, let us inquire how electricity--which apparently\r\nexists, as it were, in embryo everywhere--can be made manifest. In so\r\ndoing we shall discover that there are varying types of electricity,\r\nyet that these have a singular uniformity as to their essential\r\nproperties. As usually divided--and the classification answers\r\nparticularly well from the standpoint of the worker--electricity is\r\nspoken of as either statical or dynamical. The words themselves are\r\nsuggestive of the essential difference between the two types. Statical\r\nelectricity produces very striking manifestations. We have already\r\nspoken of it as theoretically due to the conditions of the electrons\r\nat rest. It must be understood, however, that the statical electricity\r\nwill, if given opportunity, seek to escape from any given location to\r\nanother location, under certain conditions, somewhat as water which is\r\nstored up in a reservoir will, when opportunity offers, flow down to a\r\nlower level. The pent-up static electricity has, like the water in the\r\nreservoir, a store of potential energy. The physicist speaks of it as\r\nhaving high tension. In passing to a condition of lower tension, the\r\nstatical electricity may give up a large portion of its energy.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, on a winter day in a cold climate, you walk briskly\r\nalong a wool carpet, the friction of your feet with the carpet\r\ngenerates a store of statical electricity, which immediately passes\r\nover the entire surface of your body. If now you touch another person\r\nor a metal conductor, such as a steam radiator or a gas pipe, a\r\nbrilliant spark jumps from your finger, and you experience what is\r\nspoken of as an electrical shock. If the day is very cold, and the air\r\nconsequently very dry, and if you will take pains to rub your feet\r\nvigorously or slide along the carpet, you may light a gas jet with\r\nthe spark which will spring from your finger to the tip of the jet,\r\nprovided the latter is of metal or other conducting substance; and even\r\nif you attempt to avoid the friction between your feet and the carpet\r\nas much as possible, you may be constantly annoyed by receiving a shock\r\nwhenever you touch any conductor, since, in spite of your efforts, the\r\nnecessary amount of friction sufficed to generate a store of statical\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nAn illustration of the development of this same form of electricity,\r\non a large scale, is supplied by the familiar statical machine, which\r\nconsists of a large circle of glass, so adjusted that it may be\r\nrevolved rapidly against a suitable friction producer. With such a\r\nmachine a powerful statical current is produced, capable of generating\r\na spark that may be many inches or even several feet in length,--a\r\nveritable flash of lightning. It is with such a supply of electricity\r\nconducted through a vacuum tube that the cathode ray and the Roentgen\r\nray are produced.\r\n\r\nSuch effects as this suggest considerable capacity for doing work.\r\nYet in reality, notwithstanding the very sporadical character of the\r\nresult, the quantity of electricity involved in such a statical current\r\nmay be very slight indeed. Even a lightning flash is held to represent\r\na comparatively small amount of electricity. Faraday calculated that\r\nthe amount of electricity that could be generated from a single drop\r\nof water, through chemical manipulation, would suffice to supply the\r\nlightning for a fair-sized thunder-storm. Nevertheless the destructive\r\nwork that may be done by a flash of lightning may be considerable, as\r\neveryone is aware. But, on the other hand, while the visible effect of\r\na stroke of lightning on a tree trunk, for example, makes it seem a\r\npowerful agency, yet the actual capacity to do work--the power to move\r\nconsiderable masses of matter--is extremely limited. The effect on a\r\ntree trunk, it will be recalled, usually consists of nothing more than\r\nthe stripping off of a channel of bark. In other words, the working\r\nenergy contained in a seemingly powerful supply of statical electricity\r\ncommonly plays but an insignificant part.\r\n\r\nThe working agent, and therefore the form of electricity which concerns\r\nus in the present connection, is the dynamical current. This may be\r\ngenerated in various ways, but in practice these are chiefly reducible\r\nto two. One of these depends upon chemical action, the other upon the\r\ninter-relations of mechanical motion and magnetic lines of force. A\r\ncommon illustration of the former is supplied by the familiar voltaic\r\nor galvanic battery. The electromagnetic form has been rendered\r\neven more familiar in recent times by the dynamo. This newest and\r\nmost powerful of workers will claim our attention in detail in the\r\nsucceeding chapter. Our present consideration will be directed to the\r\nolder method of generating the electric current as represented by the\r\nvoltaic cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF THE DYNAMICAL CURRENT\r\n\r\nLet us draw our illustration from a familiar source. Even should your\r\nhousehold otherwise lack electrical appliances, you are sure to have\r\nan electric call-bell. The generator of the electric current, which\r\nis stored away in some out-of-the-way corner, is probably a small\r\nso-called \"dry-cell\" which you could readily carry around in your\r\npocket; or it may consist of a receptacle holding a pint or two of\r\nliquid in which some metal plates are immersed. Such an apparatus\r\nseems scarcely more than a toy when we contrast it with the gigantic\r\ndynamos of the power-house; yet, within the limits of its capacities,\r\none is as surely a generator of electricity as the other. If we are\r\nto accept the latest theory, the electrical current which flows from\r\nthis tiny cell is precisely the same in kind as that which flows from\r\nthe five-thousand-horse-power dynamo. The difference is only one of\r\nquantity.\r\n\r\nTo understand the operation of this common household appliance we must\r\nbear in mind two or three familiar experimental facts in reference\r\nto the action of the voltaic cell. Briefly, such a cell consists of\r\ntwo plates of metal--for example, one of copper and the other of\r\nzinc--with a connecting medium, which is usually a liquid, but which\r\nmay be a piece of moistened cloth or blotting-paper. So long as the two\r\nplates of metal are not otherwise connected there is no electricity in\r\nevidence, but when the two are joined by any metal conductor, as, for\r\nexample, a piece of wire--thus, in common parlance, \"completing the\r\ncircuit\"--a current of electricity flows about this circuit, passing\r\nfrom the first metal plate to the second, through the liquid and back\r\nfrom the second plate to the first through the piece of wire. The wire\r\nmay be of any length. In the case of your call-bell, for example, the\r\nwire circuit extends to your door, and is there broken, shutting off\r\nthe current.\r\n\r\nWhen you press the button you connect the broken ends of the wire, thus\r\nclosing the circuit, as the saying is, and the re-established current,\r\nacting through a little electromagnet, rings the bell. In another case,\r\nthe wire may be hundreds of miles in length, to serve the purposes of\r\nthe telegrapher, who transmits his message by opening and closing the\r\ncircuit, precisely as you operate your door-bell. For long-distance\r\ntelegraphy, of course, large cells are required, and numbers of them\r\nare linked together to give a cumulative effect, making a strong\r\ncurrent; but there is no new principle involved.\r\n\r\nThe simplest study of this interesting mechanism makes it clear that\r\nthe cell is the apparatus primarily involved in generating the electric\r\ncurrent; yet it is equally obvious that the connecting wire plays an\r\nimportant part, since, as we have seen, when the wire is broken there\r\nis no current in evidence. Now, according to the electron theory, as\r\npreviously outlined, the electric current consists of an actual flow\r\nalong the wire of carriers of electricity which are unable to make\r\ntheir way except where a course is provided for them by what is called\r\na conductor. Dry air, for example, is, under ordinary circumstances,\r\nquite impervious to them. This means, then, that the electrons flow\r\nfreely along the wire when it is continuous, but that they are\r\npowerless to proceed when the wire is cut. When you push the button of\r\nyour call-bell, therefore, you are virtually closing the switch which\r\nenables the electrons to proceed on their interrupted journey.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF ELECTRICAL ACTION\r\n\r\nBut all this, of course, leaves quite untouched the question of the\r\norigin of the electrons themselves. That these go hurtling from one\r\nplate or pole of the battery to the other, along the wire, we can\r\nunderstand at least as a working theory; that, furthermore, the\r\nelectrons have their origin either in the metal plates or in the liquid\r\nthat connects them, seems equally obvious; but how shall we account for\r\ntheir development? It is here that the chemist with his atomic theory\r\nof matter comes to our aid. He assures us that all matter consists\r\nin the last analysis of excessively minute particles, and that these\r\nparticles are perpetually in motion. They unite with one another to\r\nform so-called molecules, but they are perpetually breaking away from\r\nsuch unions, even though they re-establish them again. Such activities\r\nof the atoms take place even in solids, but they are greatly enhanced\r\nwhen any substance passes from the solid into the liquid state.\r\n\r\nWhen, for example, a lump of salt is dissolved in water, the atoms of\r\nsodium and of chlorine which joined together make up the molecules of\r\nsalt are held in much looser bondage than they were while the salt\r\nwas in a dry or crystalline form. Could we magnify the infinitesimal\r\nparticles sufficiently to make them visible we should probably see\r\nlarge numbers of the molecules being dissociated, the liberated atoms\r\nmoving about freely for an instant and then reuniting with other atoms.\r\nThus at any given instant our solution of salt would contain numerous\r\nfree _atoms_ of sodium and of chlorine, although we are justified in\r\nthinking of this substance as a whole as composed of sodium-chlorine\r\n_molecules_. It is only by thus visualizing the activity of the atoms\r\nin a solution that we are able to provide even a thinkable hypothesis\r\nas to the development of electricity in the voltaic cell.\r\n\r\nWhat puts us on the track of the explanation we are seeking is the\r\nfact that the diverse atoms are known to have different electrical\r\nproperties. In our voltaic cell, for example, sodium atoms would\r\ncollect at one pole and chlorine atoms at the other. Humphry Davy\r\ndiscovered this fact in the early days of electro-chemistry, just about\r\na century ago. He spoke of the sodium atom as electro-positive, and\r\nof the chlorine atom as electro-negative, and he attempted to explain\r\nall chemical affinity as merely due to the mutual attraction between\r\npositively and negatively electrified atoms. The modern theorist goes\r\none step farther, and explains the negative properties of the chlorine\r\natom by assuming the presence of one negative electron or electricity\r\nin excess of the neutralizing charge. The assumption is, that the\r\nsodium atom has lost this negative electron and thus has become\r\npositively electrified. The chlorine atom, harboring the fugitive\r\nelectron, becomes negatively electrified. Hence the two atoms are\r\nattracted toward opposite poles of the cell.\r\n\r\nThis disunion of atoms, be it understood, must be supposed to take\r\nplace in the case of any solution of common salt, whether it rests\r\nin an ordinary cup or forms a part of the ocean. Here we have, then,\r\nmaterial for the generation of the electrical current, if some means\r\ncould be found to induce the chlorine atom to give up the surplus\r\nelectron which from time to time it carries. And this means is provided\r\nwhen two pieces of metal of different kinds, united with a metal\r\nconductor, are immersed in the liquid. Then it comes to pass that the\r\nelectrons associated with the chlorine atoms that chance to lie in\r\ncontact with one of these plates of metal, find in this metal an avenue\r\nof escape. They rush off eagerly along the metal and the connecting\r\nwire, and in so doing establish a current which acts--if we may venture\r\na graphic analogy from an allied field of physics--as a sort of\r\nsuction, attracting other chlorine atoms from the body of the liquid\r\nagainst the metal plate that they also may discharge their electrons.\r\nIn other words, the electrical current passes through the liquid as\r\nwell as through the outside wire, thus completing the circuit.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, then, the electrical energy in evidence in\r\nthe current from the voltaic cell, is drawn from a store of potential\r\nenergy in the atoms of matter composing the liquid in the cell. In\r\npractice, as is well known, the liquid used is one that affects one\r\nof the metal poles more actively than the other, insuring vigorous\r\nchemical activity. But the principle of atomic and electrical\r\ndissociation just outlined is the one involved, according to theory,\r\nin every voltaic cell, whatever the particular combination of metals\r\nand liquids of which it is composed. It should be added, however,\r\nthat while we are thus supplied with a thinkable explanation of the\r\norigin of this manifestation of electrical energy, no explanation is\r\nforthcoming, here any more than in the case of the dynamo, as to why\r\nthe electrons rush off in a particular direction and thus establish an\r\nelectrical current. Perhaps we should recall that the very existence of\r\nthis current has at times been doubted. Quite recently, indeed, it has\r\nbeen held that the seeming current consists merely of a condition of\r\nstrain or displacement of the ether. But we are here chiefly concerned\r\nwith the electron theory, according to which, as we have all along\r\nnoted, the seeming current is an actual current; the ether strain, if\r\nsuch exists, being due to the passage of the electrons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL USES OF ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\nVarious effects of the current of electrons have been hinted at above.\r\nConsidered in detail, the possible ways in which these currents may be\r\nutilized are multifarious. Yet, they may be all roughly classified into\r\nthree divisions as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, cases in which the current of electricity is used to transmit\r\nenergy from one place to another, and reproduce it in the form of molar\r\nmotion. The dynamo, in its endless applications, illustrates one phase\r\nof such transportation of energy; and the call-bell, the telegraph,\r\nand the telephone represent another phase. In one case a relatively\r\nlarge quantity of electricity is necessary, in the other case a small\r\nquantity; but the principle involved--that of electric and magnetic\r\ninduction--is the same in each.\r\n\r\nThe second method is that in which the current, generated by either\r\na dynamo or a battery of voltaic cells, is made to encounter a\r\nrelatively resistant medium in the course of its flow along the\r\nconducting circuit. Such resistance leads to the production of active\r\nvibrations among the particles of the resisting medium, producing the\r\nphenomena of heat and, if the activity is sufficient, the phenomena of\r\nlight also. It will thus appear that in this class of cases, as in the\r\nother, there is an actual re-transformation of electrical energy into\r\nthe energy of motion, only in this case the motion is that of molecules\r\nand not of larger bodies. The principle is utilized in the electrical\r\nheater, with which our electric street-cars are commonly provided,\r\nand which is making its way in the household for purposes of general\r\nheating and of cooking. It is utilized also in various factories,\r\nwhere the very high degree of heat attainable with the electrical\r\nfurnace is employed to produce chemical dissociation and facilitate\r\nchemical combinations. By this means, for example, a compound of\r\ncarbon and silicon, which is said to be the hardest known substance,\r\nexcept the diamond, is produced in commercial quantities. A familiar\r\nhousehold illustration of the use of this principle is furnished by the\r\nelectric light. The carbon filament in the electric bulb furnishes such\r\nresistance to the electric current that its particles are set violently\r\naquiver. Under ordinary conditions the oxygen of the air would\r\nimmediately unite with the carbon particles, volatilizing them, and\r\nthus instantly destroying the filament; but the vacuum bulb excludes\r\nthe air, and thus gives relative permanency to the fragile thread.\r\n\r\nThe third class of cases in which the electric current is commercially\r\nutilized is that in which the transformations it effects are produced\r\nin solutions comparable to those of the voltaic cell, the principles\r\ninvolved being those pointed out in the earlier part of the present\r\nchapter. By this means a metal may be deposited in a pure state upon\r\nthe surface of another metal made to act as a pole to the battery; as,\r\nfor example, when forks, spoons, and other utensils of cheap metals\r\nare placed in a solution of a silver compound, and thus electroplated\r\nwith silver. To produce the powerful effects necessary in the various\r\ncommercial applications of this principle, the poles of the voltaic\r\ncell--which cell may become in practice a large tank--are connected\r\nwith the current supplied by a dynamo. Various chemical plants at\r\nNiagara utilize portions of the currents from the great generators\r\nthere in this way. Another familiar illustration of the principle is\r\nfurnished by the copper electroplates from which most modern books are\r\nprinted.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that all the multifarious uses of electricity in\r\nmodern life are reducible to a few simple principles of action, just\r\nas electricity itself is reduced, according to the analysis of the\r\nmodern physicist, to the activities of the elementary electron. There\r\nis nothing anomalous in this, however, for in the last analysis the\r\nmechanical principles involved in doing all the world's work are few\r\nand relatively simple, however ingenious and relatively complex may be\r\nthe appliances through which these principles are made available.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nMAN'S NEWEST CO-LABORER: THE DYNAMO\r\n\r\n\r\nAs you stand waiting for your train at elevated or subway station you\r\nmust have noticed the third rail. To outward appearance it is not\r\ndifferent from the other rails. It seems a mere inert piece of steel.\r\nYet you are well aware that a strange power abides there unseen--a\r\npower that pulls the train, and that lurks in hiding to strike a\r\ndeath-blow to any chance unfortunate whose foot or hand comes in\r\ncontact with the rail. As the heavy train dashes up, dragged by this\r\nunseen power, probably you, in common with the rest of the world, have\r\nbeen led to remark, \"Is it not marvelous?\"\r\n\r\nMarvelous it surely seems. Yet the cause of our astonishment is to be\r\nsought in the relative newness of the phenomena rather than in the\r\nnature of the phenomena themselves. At first glance it may seem that\r\nthe intangible character of the electrical power gives it a unique\r\nclaim on our wonderment. But a moment's reflection dispels this\r\nillusion. After all, electricity is no more intangible than heat.\r\nNeither the one nor the other can be seen or heard, but each alike may\r\nbe felt. Yet we observe without astonishment a locomotive propelled\r\nby the power of heat--simply because the locomotive has become an old\r\nstory. Again, electricity is far less intangible than gravitation.\r\nNot merely may electricity be felt, but it may be generated through\r\ntransformation of other forms of energy; it may be stored away and\r\nmeasured; may be conducted at will through tortuous channels, or\r\nobstructed in its flight by the intervention of non-conductors. But\r\ngravitation submits to no such restrictions. It eludes all of our\r\nsenses, and it absolutely disregards all barriers. To its catholic\r\ntaste all substances are alike. It holds in bondage every particle of\r\nmatter in the universe, and can enforce its influence over every kind\r\nof atom with an impartiality that is as astounding as it is inexorable.\r\nMoreover, this weird force, gravitation, has thus far evaded all man's\r\nefforts to classify or label it. No man has the slightest inkling as\r\nto what gravitation really is. If, as you glance at these lines, you\r\nshould chance to release your hold and allow the volume to drop to the\r\nfloor, you will have performed a miracle which no scientist in the\r\nworld can even vaguely explain.\r\n\r\nAs regards our electric train, then, the fact that it stands there\r\nfirmly, held fast to the rails by gravitation, is in reality as great\r\nand as inexplicable a marvel as the fact that the electric current\r\ngives it propulsion. Not only so, but the fact that the train goes\r\nforward of its own inertia, as we say, for a time after the current\r\nis shut off, presents to us yet another inexplicable marvel. It is a\r\nfundamental property of matter, we say, when once in motion to continue\r\nin motion until stopped by some counter-force; but that phrasing,\r\nexpressive though it be of a fact upon which so many physical phenomena\r\ndepend, is in no proper sense of the word an explanation.\r\n\r\nOnce for all, then, there is nothing unique, nothing preternaturally\r\nmarvelous, about the phenomena of electricity. And indeed, it is\r\ninteresting to note how quickly we become accustomed to these\r\nphenomena, and how little wonder they excite so soon as they cease\r\nto be novel. Even imaginative people have long since ceased to give\r\nthought to the trolley car; and within a week of the opening of New\r\nYork's subway the average man came to regard it as much as a matter of\r\ncourse as if he had been accustomed to it from boyhood.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in another sense of the word, the electric motor is a\r\nwonderful contrivance. As an example of what man's ingenuity can\r\naccomplish toward transforming the powers of nature and adapting them\r\nto his own use, it is fully entitled to be called a marvel. Moreover,\r\nin the last analysis, we are as helpless to explain the nature of\r\nelectricity as we are to explain the nature of gravitation. It is only\r\nthe proximal phenomena of the electric current that can be explained.\r\nThese phenomena, however, are full of interest. Let us examine them\r\nsomewhat in detail, allowing them to lead us back from electric train\r\nto power-house and dynamo, and from dynamo as far toward the mystery of\r\nelectric energy as present-day science can guide us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANISM OF THE DYNAMO\r\n\r\nIf we could look into the interior of a mechanism in connection with\r\nthe trucks beneath the car, we should find an apparatus consisting\r\nessentially of coils of wire adjusted compactly about an axis, and\r\nclosely fitted between the poles of a powerful electromagnet. These\r\ncoils of wire constitute what is called an armature. When the current\r\nis switched on it passes through this armature, as well as through the\r\nelectromagnet, and the mutual attractions and repulsions between the\r\nmagnetic poles and the electric current in the coils of wire, cause\r\nthe armature to revolve with such tremendous energy as to move the\r\ntrain--the motion of its axis being transmitted to the axle of the\r\ncar-wheels by a simple gearing.\r\n\r\nAll this is simple enough if we regard only the _how_ and not the _why_\r\nof the phenomena. Ignoring the _why_ for the moment, let us seek the\r\norigin of the current which, by being conducted through the armature,\r\nhas produced the striking effect we have just witnessed. This current\r\nreaches the car through an overhead or underground wire. All that is\r\nessential is that some conducting medium, such as an iron rail, or\r\na copper wire, shall form an unbroken connection between the motor\r\napparatus and the central dynamo where the power is generated--the\r\nreturn circuit being made either by another wire or by the ordinary\r\nrails.\r\n\r\nThe central dynamo in question will be found, if we visit the\r\npower-house, to be a ponderous affair, suggestive to the untechnical\r\nmind of impenetrable mysteries. Yet in reality it is a device\r\nessentially the same in construction as the motor which drives\r\nthe train. That is to say, its unit of construction consists of a\r\nwire-wound armature revolving on an axis and fitted between the\r\npoles of an electromagnet. Here, however, the sequence of phenomena\r\nis reversed, for the armature, instead of receiving a current of\r\nelectricity, is made to revolve by a belt adjusted to its axis and\r\ndriven by a steam engine. The wire coils of the armature thus made to\r\nrevolve cut across the so-called lines of magnetic force which connect\r\nthe two poles of the magnet, and in so doing generate a current of\r\ninduced electricity, which flows away to reach in due course the third\r\nrail or the trolley-wire, and ultimately to propel the motor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lower figure copyrighted by N. Y. Edison Co.\r\n\r\nAN ELECTRIC TRAIN AND THE DYNAMO THAT PROPELS IT.\r\n\r\nThe lower figure gives an interior view of a power house of the\r\nManhattan Elevated Railway Company. The upper figure shows one of the\r\nelectric engines operating on the New York Central Lines just outside\r\nof New York. The power is conveyed to the engine by a third rail\r\nclearly shown in the picture.]\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to state that in actual practice this generating\r\ndynamo is a complex structure. The armature is a complex series of\r\ncoils of wire; the electromagnets surrounding the armature are several\r\nor many; and there is an elaborate system of so-called commutators\r\nthrough which the currents of electricity--which would otherwise\r\noscillate as the revolving coil cuts the lines of magnetic force in\r\nopposite directions--are made to flow in one direction. But details\r\naside, the foundation facts upon which everything depends are (1) that\r\na coil of wire when forced to move so that it cuts across the lines of\r\nforce in any magnetic field develops a so-called induced current of\r\nelectricity; and (2) that such an induced current possesses power of\r\nmagnetic attraction and repulsion. These facts were discovered more\r\nthan sixty years ago, and carefully studied by Michael Faraday, Joseph\r\nHenry, and others. Faraday found that such an induced current could be\r\nproduced not merely with the aid of an iron magnet, but even by causing\r\na wire to cut the lines of force that everywhere connect the north and\r\nsouth poles of the earth,--the earth being indeed, as William Gilbert\r\nlong ago demonstrated, veritably a gigantic magnet. Moreover, these\r\nrelations are reciprocal; so that if a wire through which a current\r\nof electricity is passing is placed across a magnetic field, the wire\r\nis impelled to move in a plane at right angles to the direction of the\r\nlines of force. It is forcibly thrust aside. This side-thrust acting on\r\ncoils of wire is what produces the revolution of the armature of the\r\nelectric motor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF THE DYNAMO\r\n\r\nThe very first studies that had to do with the mutual relations\r\nof electricity and magnetism were made by Hans Christian Oersted,\r\nthe Dane, as early as 1815. He discovered that a magnetic needle\r\nis influenced by the passage near it of a current of electricity,\r\ndemonstrating, therefore, that the electric current in some way invades\r\nthe medium surrounding any conductor along which it is passing.\r\nOersted's experiments were repeated, and some new phenomena observed by\r\nthe Frenchman André Marie Ampère and Dominique François Arago. Arago\r\nconstructed an interesting device, in which a metal disk was made to\r\nrevolve in the presence of a current of electricity; but neither he nor\r\nanyone else at the time was able to explain the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn 1824 an advance was made through the construction of the first\r\nelectric magnet by Sturgeon. Hitherto it had not been known that a\r\nmagnet could be made artificially, except by contact with a previously\r\nexisting magnet. Sturgeon showed that any core of iron may be rendered\r\nmagnetic if wound with a conducting wire, through which a current\r\nof electricity is passed. The experiments thus inaugurated were\r\nfollowed up in America by Joseph Henry of Albany who made enormous\r\nelectromagnets, capable of sustaining great weights. One of his\r\nmagnets, operated by a single cell, was able to lift six hundred and\r\nfifty pounds of metal.\r\n\r\nIt was this apparatus which was subsequently to make possible the\r\nutilization of electricity as a working force, but as yet no one\r\nsuspected its possibilities in this direction.\r\n\r\nIt remained for Michael Faraday, in 1831, to make the final\r\nexperiment which laid the secure foundation for the new science of\r\nelectrodynamics. Faraday constructed a tiny apparatus, consisting of a\r\nmagnet between the poles of which a metal disk was placed in such a way\r\nthat it could revolve on an axis, the disk being connected with a wire\r\nconveying an electric current.\r\n\r\nThe details as to this most ingenious mechanism need not be given here.\r\nSuffice it that Faraday demonstrated the interrelations of magnetism\r\nand electricity and the possibility of causing a metal disk to revolve\r\nthrough this mutual interaction. In so doing he constructed the first\r\ndynamo-electric machine. In his hands it was a mere laboratory toy,\r\nbut the principles involved were fully elaborated by the original\r\nexperimenter, and stated in precise language which modern investigators\r\nhave not been able to improve upon.\r\n\r\nSeveral decades elapsed after Faraday's initial experiment before the\r\nphenomena of magneto-electricity were proved to have any considerable\r\ncommercial significance. A vast amount of ingenuity was required to\r\ndevise a mechanism which could advantageously utilize the principle\r\nin question for commercial purposes. Indeed the early experimenters\r\ndid not at once get upon the right track, as their efforts were\r\ninfluenced disadvantageously by an attempt to follow the principle of\r\nthe steam engine. Some interesting mechanisms were devised whereby the\r\nmotion of an armature in being drawn toward an electromagnet could be\r\ntranslated into rotary motion through the use of crank-shafts and even\r\nof beams, precisely comparable to those employed in the steam engine.\r\nSuch devices worked with a comparatively low degree of efficiency and\r\nwere totally abandoned so soon as the idea of getting rotary motion\r\ndirectly from the magnet or armature was made feasible. The names of\r\nSaxton, Clarke, Woolrich, Wheatstone, and Werner Siemens are intimately\r\nconnected with the early efforts at utilization of magneto-electric\r\npower. The shuttle-wound armature of Siemens, invented in 1854, marked\r\nan important progressive step.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECTING THE DYNAMO\r\n\r\nThe first separately excited dynamos were constructed by Dr. Henry\r\nWilde, F.R.S., between 1863 and 1865, and this invention paved the way\r\nfor rapid progress. In 1866-7 Varley, Siemens, Wheatstone, and Ladd\r\nconstructed machines with several iron electromagnets, self-excited,\r\nwhich were described as dynamo-electric machines, a term afterward\r\ncontracted to dynamos. In 1867 Dr. Wilde improved the armature by\r\nintroducing several coils arranged around a cylinder; the current\r\nfrom a few of the coils was rectified and used to excite the field\r\nmagnet, while the main current as given off by the rest of the coils\r\nwas taken off by ring-contacts, the machine being a self-exciting,\r\nalternating-current dynamo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILDE'S SEPARATELY EXCITED DYNAMO.\r\n\r\nDr. Wilde invented and patented (1863-5) the first separately excited\r\ndynamo, with which he demonstrated that the feeble current from a small\r\nmagneto-electric machine would, by the expenditure of mechanical power,\r\nproduce currents of great strength from a large dynamo.]\r\n\r\nThe Italian, Picnotti, in 1864 invented a ring armature which,\r\nalthough provided with teeth was wound with coils in such a way as to\r\nobtain a very uniform current; but the practical introduction of the\r\ncontinuous-current machines dates from 1870, when Gramme re-invented\r\nthe ring and gave it the form which is still in vogue. Von Alteneck in\r\n1873 converted the Siemens shuttle armature along the same lines and so\r\nintroduced the drum arrangement which has since been very extensively\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThus through the efforts of a great number of workers the idea of\r\nutilizing electromagnetic energy for the purposes of the practical\r\nworker came to be a reality. Numberless machines have been made\r\ndiffering only as to details that need not detain us here. Everyone\r\nis familiar with sundry applications of the dynamo to the purposes of\r\nto-day's applied science. It must be understood, of course, that the\r\namount of electricity generated in any dynamo is precisely measurable,\r\nand that by no possibility could the energy thus developed exceed\r\nthe energy required to move the coils of wire. Were it otherwise the\r\ngreat law of the conservation of energy would be overthrown. In actual\r\npractice, of course, there is loss of energy in the transaction. The\r\ncurrent of electricity that flows from the very best dynamo represents\r\nconsiderably less working power than is expended by the steam engine in\r\nforcibly revolving the armature. In the early days of experiments the\r\nloss was so great as to be commercially prohibitive. With the perfected\r\nmodern dynamo the loss is not greater than fifteen per cent; but even\r\nthis, it will be noted, makes electricity a relatively expensive power\r\nas compared with steam,--except, indeed, where some natural power, like\r\nthe Falls of Niagara, can be utilized to drive the armature.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MYSTERIOUS MECHANISM\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the modern dynamo is due largely to the fact that\r\nwhen the poles of the magnet are made to face each other, the lines\r\nof magnetic force passing between these poles are concentrated into a\r\nnarrow compass. With the ordinary bar magnet, as everyone is aware,\r\nthese lines of force circle out in every direction from the poles in\r\nan almost infinite number of loops, all converging at the poles, and\r\nbecoming relatively separated at the equator in a manner which may be\r\ngraphically illustrated by the lines of longitude drawn on an ordinary\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that with a magnet of such construction only a small\r\nproportion of the lines of magnetic force could be utilized in\r\ngenerating electricity. But, as already mentioned, when the magnet\r\nis so curved that its poles face each other, the lines of force,\r\ninstead of widely diverging, pass from pole to pole almost in a direct\r\nstream. The strength of this magnetic stream may be increased almost\r\nindefinitely by winding the iron core of the magnet with the coil of\r\nwire through which the electric current is passed, thus constituting\r\nthe electromagnet which has replaced the old permanent magnet in all\r\nmodern commercial dynamos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EVOLUTION OF THE DYNAMO.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.--A small example of the original commercial form of the drum\r\narmature machine, patented in 1873 by Dr. Werner Siemens and F. Von\r\nHefner Alteneck. The armature is a development of the Siemens shuttle\r\nform of 1856, and gives a nearly continuous current. Fig. 2.--An early\r\nexperimental dynamo. Fig. 3.--Ferranti's original dynamo, patented in\r\n1882-1883. The field magnets are stationary and consist of two sets\r\nof electro-magnets each with 16 projecting pull pieces, between which\r\nthe armature revolves. Fig. 4.--The gigantic rotary converters of the\r\nManhattan Elevated Railway.]\r\n\r\nAn electromagnet may be sufficiently powerful to lift tons of iron.\r\nThe force it exerts, therefore, is very tangible in its results. Yet\r\nit seems mysterious, because so many substances are unaffected by it.\r\nYou may place your head, for example, between the poles of the most\r\npowerful magnet without experiencing any sensation or being in any\r\nobvious way affected. You may wave your hand across the lines of force\r\nas freely as you may wave it anywhere else in space. Apparently nothing\r\nis there. But were you to attempt to pass a dumb-bell or a bar of iron\r\nacross the same space, the unseen magnetic force would wrench it from\r\nyour grasp with a power so irresistible as to be awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the armature, when its coils of wire are adjusted between\r\nthe poles of the magnet, is held in a vise-like grip by the invisible\r\nbut potent lines of magnetic force which tend to make it revolve.\r\nIt requires a tremendous expenditure of energy--supplied by the\r\nsteam-engine or by water power--to enable the coiled wires of the\r\ngenerating armature to stem the current of magnetic force, which is\r\nvirtually what is done when the armature revolves in such a way as to\r\nproduce electrical energy. Part of the mechanical energy thus expended\r\nis transformed into heat and dissipated into space; but the main\r\nportion is carried off, as we have seen, through the coiled wires of\r\nthe armature in the form of what we term the current of electricity, to\r\nbe re-transformed in due course into the mechanical energy that moves\r\nthe car.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the phenomena of the electric dynamo depend upon\r\nthe curious relations that exist between magnetism and electricity.\r\nGranted the essential facts of magneto-electric induction, all the\r\nphenomena of the dynamo are explicable. But how explain these facts\r\nthemselves? Why is an electric current generated in a coil of wire\r\nmoving in a magnetic field? And why is a wire carrying a current of\r\nelectricity, when placed across a magnetic field, impelled to move at\r\nright angles to the lines of magnetic force? No thoughtful person can\r\nconsider the subject without asking these questions. But as yet no\r\ndefinitive answer is forthcoming. Some suggestive half-explanations,\r\nbased on an assumed condition of torsion or strain in the ether, have\r\nbeen attempted, but they can hardly be called more than scientific\r\nguesses.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it may be understood that the mutual relations of the\r\nmagnetic and electrical forces just referred to are not at all\r\ndependent upon the manner in which the electric current is generated.\r\nThe magneto-electric motor may be operated as well with a chemical\r\nbattery as with such a mechanical generating dynamo as has just been\r\ndescribed. The storage-batteries which have been employed in some\r\nstreet railways and those which propel the electric cabs about our\r\ncity streets furnish cases in point. The only reason these are not\r\nmore generally employed is that the storage battery has not yet been\r\nperfected so that it can produce a large supply of electricity in\r\nproportion to its weight, and produce it economically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nNIAGARA IN HARNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Harnessing Niagara\"--the phrase has been a commonplace for a\r\ngeneration; but until very recently indeed it was nothing more than a\r\nphrase. Almost since the time when the Falls were first viewed by a\r\nwhite man the idea of utilizing their powers has been dreamed of. But\r\nuntil our own day--until the last decade--science had not shown a way\r\nin which the great current could be economically shackled. A few puny\r\nmill-wheels have indeed revolved for thirty years or so, but these\r\nwere of no greater significance than the thousands of others driven by\r\nmountain streams or by the currents of ordinary rivers. But about a\r\ndecade ago the engineering skill of the world was placed in commission,\r\nand to-day Niagara is fairly in harness.\r\n\r\nIf you have ever seen Niagara--and who has not seen it?-you must have\r\nbeen struck with the metamorphosis that comes over the stream about\r\nhalf a mile above the falls. Above this point the river flows with a\r\nsmooth sluggish current. Only fifteen feet have the waters sunk in\r\ntheir placid flowing since they left Lake Erie. But now in the course\r\nof half a mile they are pitched down more than two hundred feet. If\r\nyou follow the stream toward this decline you shall see it undergo\r\na marvelous change. Of a sudden the placid waters seem to feel the\r\nbeckoning of a new impulse. Caught with the witchery of a new motion,\r\nthey go swirling ahead with unwonted lilt and plunge, calling out with\r\nribald voices that come to the ear in an inchoate chorus of strident,\r\nhigh-pitched murmurings. Each wavelet seems eager to hurry on to the\r\nfull fruition of the cataract. It lashes with angry foam each chance\r\nobstruction, and gurgles its disapproval in ever-changing measures.\r\nEven to the most thoughtless observer the mighty current thus unchained\r\nattests the sublimity of almost irresistible power. Could a mighty\r\nmill-wheel be adjusted in that dizzy current, what labors might it\r\nnot perform? Five million tons of water rush down this decline each\r\nhour, we are told; and the force that thus goes to waste is as if\r\nthree million unbridled horses exhausted their strength in ceaseless\r\nplunging. This estimate may be only a guess, but it matters not whether\r\nit be high or low; all estimates are futile, all comparisons inadequate\r\nto convey even a vague conception of the majesty of power with which\r\nthe mighty waters rush on to their final plunge into the abysm.\r\n\r\nIt is here, you might well suppose, where the appalling force of the\r\ncurrent is made so tangible, that man would place the fetters of his\r\nharness, making the madcap current subject to his will. You will\r\nperhaps more than half expect to see gigantic mechanisms of man's\r\nconstruction built out over the rapids or across the face of the\r\ncataract--so much has been said of æstheticism versus commercialism in\r\nconnection with the attempt to utilize Niagara's power. But whatever\r\nyour fears in this regard, they will not be realized. Inspect the\r\nrapids and the falls as you may, you will see no evidence that man\r\nhas tampered with their pristine freedom. Subtler means have been\r\nemployed to tame the wild steed. The mad waves that go dashing down\r\nthe rapids are as free and untrammeled to-day as they were when the\r\nwild Indian was the only witness of their tempestuous activity. Such\r\nportions of the current as reach the rapids have full license to pass\r\non untrammeled, paying no toll to man. The water which is made to pay\r\ntribute is drawn from the stream up there above the rapids, where it\r\nlies placid and as yet unstirred by the beckoning incline. To see\r\nNiagara in harness, then, you must leave the cataract and the rapids\r\nand pass a full mile up the stream where the great river looks as calm\r\nas the Hudson or the Mississippi, and where, under ordinary conditions,\r\nnot even the sound of the falls comes to your ear.\r\n\r\nProsaic enough it seems to observe here nothing more startling than a\r\nbroad _cul de sac_ of stagnant water, like the beginning of a broad\r\ncanal, extending in for a few hundred yards only from the main stream;\r\nits waters silent, currentless, seemingly impotent. This stagnant\r\npool, then, not the whirling current below, is to furnish the water\r\nwhose reserve force of energy of position is drawn upon to serve man's\r\ngreedy purpose. Coming from the rapids and cataract to this stagnant\r\ncanal, you seem to step from the realm of poetic beauty to the sordid\r\nrealities of the work-a-day world. Of a truth it would seem that\r\n\"harnessing Niagara\" is but a far-fetched metaphor.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITHIN THE POWER-HOUSE\r\n\r\nAnd yet if you will turn aside from the canal and enter one of the\r\nlong, low buildings that flank it on either side, you will soon be\r\nmade to feel that the metaphor was amply justified. Little as there\r\nwas exteriorly to suggest it, you are entering a fairyland of applied\r\nscience, and within these plain walls you shall witness evidences\r\nof the ingenuity of man that should appeal scarcely less to your\r\nimagination than the sight of the cataract itself in all its sublimity\r\nof power.\r\n\r\nFor within these walls, by a miracle of modern science, the potential\r\nenergy which resides in the water of the canal is transformed into\r\nan electrical current which is sent out over a network of wires to\r\ndistant cities to perform a thousand necromantic tasks,--propelling a\r\nstreet car in one place, effecting chemical decompositions in another;\r\nturning the wheels of a factory here and lighting the streets of a city\r\nthere; in short, subserving the practical needs of man in devious and\r\nwonderful ways.\r\n\r\nEven as you gazed disdainfully at the stagnant canal, its waters,\r\nmiraculously transformed, were propelling the trolley cars along the\r\nbrink of the cliff over there on the Canadian shore, and at the same\r\ntime were turning the wheels in many a factory in the distant city of\r\nBuffalo. After all, then, the quiet pool of water was not so prosaic as\r\nit seemed.\r\n\r\nAs you stand in the building where this wonderful transformation of\r\npower is effected, the noble simplicity of the vista heightens the\r\nmystery. The most significant thing that strikes the eye is a row\r\nof great mushroom-like affairs, for all the world like giant tops,\r\nthat stand spinning--and spinning. These great tops are about a dozen\r\nfeet in diameter. They are whirling, so we are told, at a rate of two\r\nhundred and fifty revolutions per minute. Hour after hour they spin on,\r\nnever varying in speed, never faltering; day and night are alike to\r\nthem, and one day is like another. They are as ceaselessly active, as\r\nunwearying as Niagara itself, whose power they symbolize; and, like the\r\ngreat Falls, they murmur exultingly as they work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW IN ONE OF THE POWER HOUSES AT NIAGARA.\r\n\r\nEach of the top-like dynamos generates 5000 horse-power.]\r\n\r\nThe giant tops which thus seem to bid defiance to the laws of motion\r\nare in reality electric dynamos, no different in principle from the\r\nelectric generators with which some visit to a street-car power-house\r\nhas doubtless made you familiar. The anomalous feature of these\r\ndynamos--in addition to their size--is found in the fact that they\r\nrevolve on a vertical shaft which extends down into a hole in the earth\r\nfor more than a hundred feet, and at the other end of which is adjusted\r\na gigantic turbine water-wheel. Water from the canal is supplied this\r\ngreat turbine wheel through a steel tube or penstock, seven feet in\r\ndiameter. As the turbine revolves under stress of this mighty column\r\nof water, the long shaft revolves with it, thus turning the electric\r\ngenerator at the other end of the shaft--the generator at which we\r\nare looking, and which we have likened to a giant top--without the\r\ninterposition of any form of gearing whatever.\r\n\r\nTo gain a vivid mental picture of the apparatus, we must take an\r\nelevator and descend to the lower regions where the turbine wheel is\r\nin operation. As we pass down and down, our eyes all the time fixed on\r\nthe vertical revolving shaft, which is visible through a network of\r\nbars and gratings, it becomes increasingly obvious that to speak of\r\nthis shaft as standing in \"a hole in the ground\" is to do the situation\r\nvery scant justice. A much truer picture will be conceived if we think\r\nof the entire power-house as a monster building, about two hundred feet\r\nhigh, all but the top story being underground. What corresponds to\r\nthe ground floor of the ordinary building is located one hundred and\r\nfifty feet below the earth's surface; and it is the top story which we\r\nentered from the street level, thus precisely reversing the ordinary\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENSTOCKS AND TURBINES\r\n\r\nAs we descend now and reach at last the lowest floor of the building,\r\nwe step out into a long narrow room, the main surface of which is taken\r\nup with a series of gigantic turnip-shaped mechanisms, each one having\r\na revolving shaft at its axis; while from its side projects outward and\r\nthen upward a seven-foot steel tube, for all the world like the funnel\r\nof a steamship. This seeming funnel--technically termed a penstock--is\r\nin reality the great tube through which the massive column of water\r\nfinds access to the turbine wheel, which of course is incased within\r\nthe turnip-shaped mechanism at its base.\r\n\r\nAs you stand there beside this great steel mechanism a sense of\r\nwonderment and of utter helplessness takes possession of you. As you\r\nglance down the hall at this series of great water conduits, and\r\nstrain your eyes upward in the endeavor to follow the great funnel to\r\nits very end, an oppressive sense of the irresistible weight of the\r\ngreat column of water it supports comes to you, and you can scarcely\r\navoid a feeling of apprehension. Suppose one of the great tubes were to\r\nburst?--we should all be drowned like rats in a hole. There is small\r\ndanger, to be sure, of such a contingency; but it is well worth while\r\nto have stood thus away down here at the heart of the great power-house\r\nto have gained an awed sense of what man can accomplish toward rivaling\r\nthe wonders of nature. To have stood an hour ago on the ice bridge at\r\nthe foot of the most tremendous cataract in the world, where Nature\r\nexhausts her powers amidst the mad rush and roar of seething waters;\r\nand now to stand beneath this other column of water which effects a no\r\nless wonderful transformation of energy, serenely, silently,--is to\r\nhave run such a gamut of emotions as few other hours in all your life\r\ncan have in store for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MIRACULOUS TRANSFORMATION OF ENERGY\r\n\r\nThere are eleven of these great turbine mechanisms, each with a\r\nsupplying funnel of water and a revolving shaft extending upward to its\r\ncompanion dynamo, in the room in which we stand. Energy representing\r\nfifty-five thousand horse-power is incessantly transformed and made\r\navailable for man's use in the subterranean building in which we stand.\r\nAnd there is not a pound of coal, not a lick of flame, not an atom\r\nof steam involved in the transformation. There are no dust-grimed\r\nlaborers; there is no glare of furnace, no glow of heat, no stifling\r\nodor of burning fuel;--there is only the restful hum of the machinery\r\nthat responds to the ceaseless flow of the silent and invisible waters.\r\nDay and night the mighty river here pulls away at its turbine harness;\r\nand man, having once adjusted that harness, may take his ease and enjoy\r\nthe fruits of his ingenuity.\r\n\r\nAs we return now to the top of the building, we shall view the spinning\r\ndynamos with renewed interest, and a few facts regarding their output\r\nof energy may well claim our attention. In their principle of action,\r\nas we have seen, all dynamos are alike,--depending upon the mutual\r\nrelations between the wire-wound armature and a magnetic field. In the\r\npresent case the magnets are made to revolve and the armatures are\r\nstationary, but this is a mere detail. There is one feature of these\r\ndynamos, however, which is of greater importance,--the fact namely that\r\nthey operate without commutators, and therefore produce alternating\r\ncurrents. This fact has an important bearing upon the distribution of\r\nthe current. Each of the dynamos before us generates the equivalent\r\nof five thousand horse-power of energy. There are eleven such dynamos\r\nhere before us; there are ten more in the power-house on the other\r\nside of the canal, giving a total of one hundred and five thousand\r\nhorse-power for this single plant; and there are five such plants now\r\nin existence or in course of construction to utilize the waters of\r\nNiagara, three being on the Canadian shore. When in full operation the\r\naggregate output of these plants will be six or seven hundred thousand\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBTERRANEAN TAIL-RACES\r\n\r\nAs we step from the door of the power-house and stand again beside the\r\ncanal whose waters produce the wonderful effects we have witnessed\r\nin imagination, one question remains to be answered: What becomes of\r\nthe water after it has passed through the turbine wheels down there\r\nin the depths? The answer is simple: All the water from the various\r\nturbines flows away into a great subterranean canal which passes down\r\nbeneath the city of Niagara Falls, and discharges finally at the level\r\nof the rapids a few hundred yards below the Falls. The construction of\r\nthis subterranean canal would in itself have been considered a great\r\nengineering feat a few decades ago; but of late years mountain tunnels,\r\nsuch subterranean railways as the London \"tube system\" and tunnels\r\nbeneath rivers have robbed such structures of their mystery. It may be\r\nadded that another such subterranean canal, to serve as a tail-race for\r\none of the new Canadian plants, extends beneath the cataract itself,\r\ndischarging not far from the centre of the Horseshoe Falls. Another of\r\nthe power companies utilizes the water of the old surface canal which\r\nextends to the brink of the gorge some distance below the Falls. Yet\r\nanother company on the Canadian side conveys water from far above the\r\nrapids in a gigantic closed tube to the brink of the gorge just below\r\nthe Canadian Falls, above the point where their power-house is located.\r\n\r\nBut the principle involved is everywhere the same. The idea is merely\r\nto utilize the weight of falling water. The water of Niagara River\r\nis of course no different from any other body of water of equal size.\r\nIt is merely that its unique position gives the engineer an easy\r\nopportunity to utilize the potential energy that resides in any body\r\nof water--or, for that matter, in any other physical substance--lying\r\nat a high level. In due course, doubtless, other bodies of water,\r\nsuch as mountain lakes and mountain streams will be similarly put\r\ninto electrical harness. The electrical feature is of course the one\r\nthat most appeals to the imagination. But it may be well to recall\r\nthat the ultimate source of all the power in question is gravitation.\r\nPeople fond of philosophical gymnastics may reflect with interest that,\r\naccording to the newest theory, gravitation itself is, in the last\r\nanalysis, an electrical phenomenon--a reflection which, it will be\r\nnoted, leads the mind through a very curious cycle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT ON THE FALLS\r\n\r\nMuch solicitude has been expressed as to the possible effect, upon the\r\nFalls themselves, of this withdrawal of water. For the present, it is\r\nadmitted, there is no visible effect; and to the casual observer it\r\nmay seem that almost any quantity of water the power-houses are likely\r\nto need might be withdrawn without seriously marring the wonderful\r\ncataract. But the statistics supplied by the power companies, taken in\r\nconnection with estimates as to the bulk of water that passes over the\r\nFalls, do not support this optimistic view. Taking what seems to be a\r\nreasonable estimate for a basis of computation it would appear that\r\nwhen the power-houses now rapidly approaching completion are in full\r\noperation, the total withdrawal of water from the stream will represent\r\na very appreciable fraction of its entire bulk--one-twenty-fifth at\r\nthe very least, perhaps as much as one-tenth. Such a diminution as\r\nthis will by no means ruin the Falls, yet it would seem as if it must\r\nsensibly affect them, particularly at some places near Goat Island,\r\nwhere the water flows at present in a very shallow stream. Be that as\r\nit may, however, the power-houses are there, and it is probable that\r\ntheir number will be added to as years go on. Whether commercialism or\r\næstheticism will win in the end, it remains for the legislators of the\r\nfuture to decide.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, it is gratifying to reflect that for the present the Falls\r\nretain their pristine beauty, even though part of the water that is\r\ntheir normal due is turned aside and made to do service for man in\r\nanother way. There is only one reason why the Falls have escaped\r\ndesecration so long as they have; that reason being the very practical\r\none that until quite recently man has not known how to utilize their\r\npowers to advantage. The effort was indeed made, a full generation\r\nago, through the construction of the canal leading from the upper\r\nriver to the bluffs overlooking the gorge below the cataract. Here\r\na few mill-wheels were set whirling, and a tiny fraction of the\r\npotential energy of the water was utilized. There was no mechanical\r\ndifficulty involved in the utilization of this power. Mill-wheels are\r\na familiar old-time device, and even the turbine wheel is modern only\r\nin a relative sense of the word. And it must be understood that the\r\nturbine water-wheel utilizes the greatest proportion of the power of\r\nfalling water of any contrivance as yet known to mechanics. It was\r\npossible, then, to utilize the water of Niagara with full effectiveness\r\nfifty years ago, so far as the direct action of the water-wheel upon\r\nmachinery near at hand was concerned. The sole difficulty lay in the\r\nfact that only a small amount of machinery can be placed in any one\r\nlocation. The real problem was not how to produce the power, but how to\r\ntransmit it to a distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSMISSION OF POWER\r\n\r\nFor fifty years mechanical engineers have looked enviously upon\r\nunshackled Niagara, and have striven to solve the problem of\r\ntransmitting its power. It were easy enough to harness the great Fall,\r\nbut futile to do so, so long as the power generated must be used in the\r\nimmediate vicinity. So, many schemes for transmitting power were tried\r\none after another, and as often laid aside. There was one objection\r\nto even the best of them--the cost. At one time it was thought that\r\ncompressed air might solve the problem. But repeated experiments did\r\nnot justify the hope. Then it was believed that the storage battery\r\nmight be made available. The storage battery, it might be explained,\r\ndoes not really store electricity in the sense in which the Leyden\r\njar, for example, stores it. Rather is it to be likened to an ordinary\r\nvoltaic cell, the chemical ingredients of which have been rendered\r\nactive by the passage of the electric current. The active ingredients\r\nof the storage battery are usually lead compounds, which through action\r\nof the electric currents have been decomposed and placed in a state of\r\nchemical instability. The dissociated molecule of the lead compound,\r\nwhen permitted to reunite with the atoms with which it was formerly\r\nassociated, will give up electrical energy.\r\n\r\nSuch a storage battery might readily be charged with electricity\r\ngenerated at Niagara Falls. It might then be conveyed to any part of\r\nthe world, and, its poles being connected, the charge of electricity\r\nwould be made available. Such storage batteries are in common use\r\nin connection with electric automobiles, as we have seen. But the\r\ngreat difficulty is that they are enormously heavy in proportion to\r\nthe amount of electricity that they can generate; therefore, their\r\ntransportation is difficult and expensive. In practice it is cheaper\r\nto produce electricity through the operation of a steam engine in a\r\ndistant city than to transmit the electricity with the aid of a storage\r\nbattery from Niagara. So the storage battery served as little as\r\ncompressed air to solve the engineer's problem.\r\n\r\nWhen the electric dynamo became a commercial success for such purposes\r\nas the operation of trolley lines it seemed as if the Niagara problem\r\nwas on the verge of solution. And so, in point of fact, it really was,\r\nthough more time was required for it than at first seemed needed. The\r\npower generated by the dynamo could, indeed, be transmitted along a\r\nwire, but not without great loss. Sir William Siemens, in 1877, had\r\npointed out in connection with this very subject of the wasted power\r\nof Niagara, that a thousand horse-power might be transmitted a distance\r\nof, say, thirty miles over a copper rod three inches in diameter. But a\r\ncopper rod three inches in diameter is enormously expensive, and when\r\nSiemens further stated that sixty per cent of the power involved would\r\nbe lost in transmission, it was obvious that the method was far too\r\nwasteful to be commercially practicable.\r\n\r\nFor a time the experimenters with the transmission of electricity\r\nalong a wire were on the wrong track. They were experimenting with a\r\ncontinuous current which, as we have seen, is produced from an ordinary\r\ndynamo with the aid of a commutator. But hosts of experiments finally\r\nmade it clear that this form of current, no matter how powerful it\r\nmight be, is unable to traverse considerable distance without great\r\nloss, being frittered away in the form of heat.\r\n\r\nBut the very term \"continuous current\" implies the existence of a\r\ncurrent that is not continuous. In point of fact, we have already\r\nseen that a dynamo, if not supplied with a commutator, will produce\r\nwhat is called an alternating current, and such a current has long\r\nbeen known to possess properties peculiar to itself. It is, in\r\neffect, an interrupted current, and it is sometimes spoken of as if\r\nit really consisted of an alternation of currents which move first in\r\none direction and then in another. Such a conception is not really\r\njustifiable. The more plausible explanation is that the alternating\r\ncurrent is one in which the electrons are not evenly distributed and\r\nmove with irregular motion. Perhaps we may think of the individual\r\nelectrons of such a current as oscillating in their flight, and, as\r\nit were, boring their way into the resisting medium. In any event,\r\nexperience shows that such a current, under proper conditions, may be\r\nable to traverse a conducting wire for a long distance with relatively\r\nsmall loss.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood, however, that the mere fact that a current\r\nalternates is not in itself sufficient to make feasible its\r\ntransmission to a remote distance. To meet all the requirements a\r\ncurrent must be of very high voltage. This means, in so far as we\r\ncan represent the conditions of one form of energy in the terms of\r\nanother, that it shall be under high pressure. Fortunately a relatively\r\nsimple apparatus enables the electrician to transform a current from\r\nlow to high voltage without difficulty. And so at last the problem\r\nof transmitting power to a distance of many miles has been solved.\r\nElectrical currents representing thousands of horse-power are to-day\r\ntransmitted from Niagara Falls to the city of Buffalo over ordinary\r\nwires, with a loss that is relatively insignificant. A plant is in\r\nprocess of construction that will similarly transmit the power to\r\nToronto; and it is predicted that in the near future the powers of\r\nNiagara will be drawn upon by the factories of cities even as far\r\ndistant as New York and Chicago. Practical difficulties still stand in\r\nthe way of such very distant transmission, to be sure, but these are\r\nmatters of detail, and are almost certain to be overcome in the near\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nAll this being explained, it will be understood that the sole reason\r\nwhy the new power-houses at Niagara generate electricity is that\r\nelectricity is the one readily transportable carrier of energy. We have\r\nalready explained that there is loss of energy when the steam engine\r\noperates the dynamo. At Niagara, of course, no steam is involved; it\r\nis the energy of falling water that is transformed into the energy of\r\nthe electrical current. Moreover, the revolving dynamo is attached to\r\nthe same shaft with the turbine water-wheel, so that there is no loss\r\nthrough the interposition of gearing. Yet even so, the electric current\r\nthat flows from the dynamo represents somewhat less of energy than\r\nthe water current that flows into the turbine. This loss, however, is\r\ncompensated a thousandfold by the fact that the energy of the electric\r\ncurrent may now be distributed in obedience to man's will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"STEP UP\" AND \"STEP DOWN\" TRANSFORMERS\r\n\r\nThe dynamos in operation at Niagara do not differ in principle from\r\nthose in the street-car power-house, except in the fact that they\r\nare not supplied with commutators. We have seen that these dynamos\r\nare of enormous size. Those already in operation generate five\r\nthousand horse-power; others in process of construction will develop\r\nten thousand. The generator which produces this enormous current is\r\nabout eleven feet in diameter, and it makes two hundred and fifty\r\nrevolutions per minute. The armatures are so wound that the result is\r\nan alternating current of electricity of twenty-two hundred volts.\r\nThis current represents, it has been said, raw material which is to\r\nbe variously transformed as it is supplied to different uses. To\r\nfactories near at hand, indeed, the current of twenty-two hundred\r\nvolts is supplied unchanged; but for more distant consumption it is\r\nraised to ten thousand volts; and that portion which is sent away to\r\nthe factories of Buffalo and other equally distant places is raised to\r\ntwenty-two thousand volts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELECTRICAL TRANSFORMERS.\r\n\r\nThe upper figure shows Ferranti's experimental transformer built in\r\n1888. It has a closed iron circuit, built up of thin strips filling the\r\ninterior of the coil and having their ends bent over and overlapping\r\noutside. The lower figure shows a simple transformer known as\r\nSturgeon's induction coil. The middle figure gives a view of the series\r\nof converters in the power house of the Manhattan Elevated Railway.]\r\n\r\nThe transformation from a relatively low voltage to the high one\r\nis effected by means of what is called a step-up transformer. This\r\nis an apparatus which brings into play a principle of electric\r\ninduction not very different from that which was responsible for the\r\ngeneration of the current of electricity in the dynamo. The principle\r\nis that evidenced in the familiar laboratory apparatus known as the\r\nRuhmkorff coil. The transformer consists essentially of a primary\r\ncoil of relatively large wire, surrounded by, but insulated from, a\r\nsecondary coil of relatively fine wire. When the interrupted current\r\nis sent through the primary coil of such an apparatus, an induced\r\ncounter-current is generated in the secondary coil. Of course there is\r\nno gain in the actual quantity of electricity, but the voltage of the\r\ncurrent generated in the finer wire is greatly increased. For example,\r\nas we have seen, the current that came from the dynamo at twenty-two\r\nhundred volts is raised to ten thousand or twenty-two thousand volts.\r\nThese proportions may be varied indefinitely by varying the relative\r\nsizes and lengths of the primary and secondary coils.\r\n\r\nHow shall we picture to ourselves the actual change in the current\r\nrepresented by this difference in voltage? We might prove, readily\r\nenough, that the difference is a real one, since a wire carrying a\r\ncurrent of low voltage may be handled with impunity, while a similar\r\nwire carrying a current of high voltage may not safely be touched. But\r\nwhen we attempt to visualize the difference in the two currents we are\r\nall at sea. We may suppose, of course, that electrons spread out over a\r\nlong stretch of the secondary coil must be more widely scattered. One\r\ncan conceive that the electrons, thus relatively unimpeded, may acquire\r\na momentum, and hence a penetrative power, which they retain after they\r\nare crowded together in a straight conductor. But this suggestion at\r\nbest merely hazards a guess.\r\n\r\nArrived at the other end of its journey, the current which travels\r\nunder this high voltage is retransformed into a low-voltage current\r\nby means of an apparatus which simply reverses the conditions\r\nof the step-up transformer, and which, therefore, is called a\r\nstep-down transformer. The electricity which came to Buffalo as a\r\ntwenty-two-thousand-volt current is thus reduced by any desired\r\namount before it is applied to the practical purposes for which it is\r\ndesigned. It may, for example, be \"stepped-down\" to two thousand volts\r\nto supply the main wires of an electric-lighting plant; and then again\r\n\"stepped-down\" to two hundred volts to supply the electric lamps of an\r\nindividual house.\r\n\r\nWho that reads by the light of one of these electric lamps, let us say\r\nin Buffalo, and realizes that he is reading by the transformed energy\r\nof Niagara River, dare affirm that in our day there is nothing new\r\nunder the sun?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE BANISHMENT OF NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nOne great fundamental advantage that man has won over the other\r\nanimals is that although by nature a diurnal animal he has made night\r\nalmost equally subject to his dominion through the use of artificial\r\nlight. He thus establishes an average day of sixteen or eighteen\r\nhours in place of the twelve-hour day within which his activities\r\nwould otherwise be restricted. Of course this conquest of the night\r\nbegan at an early stage of the human development, since a certain\r\nfamiliarity with the uses of fire was attained long before man came out\r\nof the ages of savagery. But when the transition had been made from\r\nthe primitive torch to the simplest type of lamp, there was for many\r\ncenturies a cessation of progress in this direction, and it remained\r\nfor comparatively recent generations to provide more efficient methods\r\nof lighting. Indeed, the culminating achievements are matters which\r\nmake the most recent history. It is the purpose of the ensuing pages\r\nto narrate the story of the successive practical achievements through\r\nwhich man has been enabled virtually to turn night into day.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE TORCH AND OPEN LAMP\r\n\r\nTo moderns, in an age when even the time-honored gas jets and kerosene\r\nlamps are regarded as obsolescent, that ancient form of illuminant,\r\nthe candle, seems about the most primitive form of light-producing\r\napparatus. In point of fact, however, the candle holds no such place\r\nin the chronological order of lighting-device discovery, being a\r\nrelatively late innovation. Indeed, lamps of various kinds, even those\r\nburning petroleum, were used thousands of years before the relatively\r\nclean and effective candle was invented.\r\n\r\nThe camp fires of primitive man must have suggested the use of a\r\nfire-brand for lighting purposes almost as soon as the discovery of\r\nfire itself; but the development of any means of lighting his caves or\r\nrude huts, even in the form of torches, was probably a slow process.\r\nFor our earliest ancestors were not the nocturnal creatures their\r\ndescendants became early in the history of civilization. To them the\r\nperiod of darkness was the time for sleeping, and their waking hours\r\nwere those between dawn and dusk. It was only when man had reached a\r\nrelatively high plane above the other members of the animal kingdom,\r\ntherefore, that he would wish to prolong the daylight, and then the use\r\nof the torch made of some resinous wood would naturally suggest itself.\r\n\r\nJust when the ancient lamp was invented in the form of a vessel\r\nfilled with oil into which some kind of wick was dipped, cannot be\r\nascertained, but its invention certainly antedated the Christian Era\r\nby several centuries. And it is equally certain that once this smoky,\r\nfoul-smelling lamp had been discovered, it remained in use, practically\r\nwithout change or improvement, until the end of the twelfth century,\r\nthe date of the invention of the candle. Such lamps were used by the\r\nGreeks and Romans, great quantities of them being still preserved. They\r\nwere simply shallow, saucer-like vessels for holding the oil, into\r\nwhich the wick was laid, so arranged that the upper end rested against\r\nthe edge of the vessel. Here the oil burned and smoked, capillarity\r\nsupplying oil to the burning end of the wick, which was pulled up from\r\ntime to time as it became shortened by burning, either with pincers\r\nmade for the purpose, or perhaps more frequently by the ever useful\r\nhairpin of the matron.\r\n\r\nAs the thick wick did not allow the air to penetrate to burn the carbon\r\nof the oil completely, a nauseous smoke was given off constantly which\r\nwas stifling when a draught of air prevented its escape through the\r\nhole in the roof--the only chimney used by the Greeks. And since this\r\nwas the only kind of lamp known at the time, the palace of the Roman\r\nEmperor and hut of the Roman peasant were necessarily alike in their\r\nmethods of lighting if in little else. The Emperor's lamps might be\r\nmodeled of gold and set with precious stones, while those of the\r\npeasant were of rudely modeled clay; but each must have evoked, along\r\nwith its dim light, an unwholesome modicum of smoke and malodor.\r\n\r\nIt was this form of lamp, practically unaltered except occasionally in\r\ndesign, that remained in common use during the Middle Ages; and when,\r\nat the close of the twelfth century, the \"tallow candle\" was invented,\r\nthat now despised device must have been almost as revolutionary in its\r\neffect as the incandescent burner and the electric bulb were destined\r\nto be in a more recent generation. It burned with dazzling brilliancy\r\nin comparison with the oil lamp; it gave off no smoke and little smell;\r\nit needed no care, and it occupied little space. Then for the first\r\ntime in the history of the world reasonably good house illumination\r\nbecame possible. Several additional centuries elapsed, however, before\r\nthe idea was developed of placing a candle in a covered glass-sided\r\nreceptacle, to form a lantern or a street lamp.\r\n\r\nFor generations the candle held supreme place, though its cost made it\r\nsomething of a luxury; doubly so if wax was substituted for tallow in\r\nits composition. But toward the close of the eighteenth century, when\r\nthe action of combustion had begun to be better understood, attempts\r\nwere made to improve the wicks and burners of oil lamps. In 1783, an\r\ninventor named Leger, of Paris, produced a burner using a broad, flat,\r\nribbonlike wick in which practically every part of the oil supply was\r\nbrought into contact with the air, producing, therefore, a steady flame\r\nrelatively free from smoke. The flame, while broad, was extremely thin,\r\nand its light was consequently radiated very unevenly. Portions of a\r\nroom lying in the direction of the long axis of the flame were but\r\npoorly lighted. To overcome this difficulty, a curved form of burner\r\nwas adopted; and this led eventually to the invention of the circular\r\nArgand burner, the prototype of the best modern lamp-burners.\r\n\r\n\r\nTALLOW CANDLE AND PERFECTED OIL LAMP\r\n\r\nStated in scientific terms, the problem of the ideal lamp-wick resolves\r\nitself into a question of how to supply oxygen to every portion of\r\nthe flame in sufficient quantities to bring all the carbon particles\r\nto a temperature at which they are luminous. It occurred to Argand\r\nthat this could be done by giving the wick a circular form like a\r\ncylindrical tube, giving the air free access to the centre of the tube\r\nas well as to its outer surface. In his lamp the reservoir of oil was\r\nplaced at a little distance from, and slightly above, the tube holding\r\nthe burner, connected with it by a small tube much as the tank of\r\nthe modern \"student lamp\" connects with the burner. In this manner a\r\nfairly good lamp was produced,--a decided improvement over any made\r\nheretofore,--and when, in 1765, Quinquet added a glass chimney to this\r\nlamp a new epoch of artificial lighting was inaugurated. \"This date is\r\nof as much importance in artificial lighting as is 1789 in politics,\"\r\nsays one writer. \"Between the ancient lamps and the lamps of Quinquet\r\nthere is as much difference as between the chimney-place of our parlors\r\nand the fireplaces of our original Aryan ancestors, formed by a hole\r\ndug in the ground in the centre of their cabins.\"\r\n\r\nA little later Carcel still further improved the Quinquet lamp by\r\nadapting a clock movement that forced the oil to rise to the wick,\r\nso that it was no longer necessary to have the burner and the\r\nreservoir separated by a tube. This was still further improved upon\r\nby substituting a spring for the clockwork, the result being a lamp\r\nof great simplicity, yet one which gave such results that it replaced\r\nthe candle as a unit for measuring the illuminating power of different\r\nsources of light.\r\n\r\nThese various burners should not be confused with the modern burners of\r\nthe ordinary kerosene lamps. Mineral oils had not as yet come into use\r\nfor illuminating purposes, except as torches or in simple lamps like\r\nthose of the Romans, as refining processes had not been perfected, and\r\nthe smoke and odors from crude petroleum were absolutely intolerable in\r\nclosed rooms.\r\n\r\nMany other substances were tried in place of the heavy oils, such as\r\nthe volatile hydrocarbons and alcohols, but with no great success.\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century a lamp burning turpentine, under\r\nthe name of \"camphine,\" was invented that gave a good light and was\r\nsmokeless; but like most others of its type, it was dangerous owing\r\nto its liability to explode. And it was not until methods of refining\r\npetroleum had been improved that \"mineral-oil lamps\"--the predecessors\r\nof the modern type of lamps--came into use.\r\n\r\nThe invention of this type of lamp was a relatively easy task--a\r\nsimple transition and adaptation as processes of refining the oil were\r\nperfected. The principle of combustion was, of course, the same as in\r\nthe Argand type of lamps burning animal and vegetable oils; but mineral\r\noils are of such consistency that capillarity causes an abundant supply\r\nof oil to rise in the wick, so that clockwork and spring devices, such\r\nas were used in the Carcel lamps, could be dispensed with.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS LIGHTING\r\n\r\nWhile the rivalry between the candle and the new forms of lamps was at\r\nits height, and just as the lamp was gaining complete supremacy, a new\r\nmethod of artificial illumination was discovered that was destined to\r\neclipse all others for half a century, and then finally to succumb to a\r\nstill better form. As early as the beginning of the eighteenth century\r\nthe Rev. Joseph Clayton, in England, had made experiments in the\r\ndistillation of coal, producing a gas that was inflammable. A little\r\nlater Dr. Stephen Hales published his work on _Vegetable Staticks_, in\r\nwhich he described the process of distilling coal in which a definite\r\namount of gas could be obtained from a given quantity of coal.\r\n\r\nNo practical use was made of this discovery, however, until over\r\nhalf a century later. But just at the close of the century a Scot,\r\nWilliam Murdoch, became interested in the possibilities of gases\r\nas illuminants, and finally demonstrated that coal gas could be\r\nput to practical use. In 1798, being employed in the workshops of\r\nBoulton and Watt in Birmingham, he fitted up an apparatus in which he\r\nmanufactured gas, lighting the workshops by means of jets connected by\r\ntubes with this primitive plant. Shortly after this, a Frenchman, M.\r\nLebon, lighted his house in Paris with gas distilled from wood, and\r\nthe Parisians soon became interested in the new illuminant. England\r\nseems to have been the first country to use it extensively in public\r\nbuildings, however, the London Lyceum Theatre being lighted with gas\r\nin 1803. By 1810 the great Gas-Light and Coke Company was formed, and\r\nwithin the next five years gas street-lamps had become familiar objects\r\nin the streets of London, and house illumination by this means a common\r\nthing among the wealthier classes.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of gas-lighting the results were frequently\r\ndisappointing, because no suitable and efficient type of burner had\r\nbeen devised; but in 1820 Neilson of Glasgow discovered the principle\r\nof the now familiar flat burner, of which more examples still remain\r\nin use the world over than of all other kinds combined. Indeed, this\r\nsimple, but as we now regard it, inefficient burner, would probably\r\nhave remained the best-known type for many years longer than it did\r\nhad not the possibilities of lighting by electricity aroused persons\r\ninterested in the great gas-plants to the fact that the new illuminant\r\nwas jeopardizing their enormous investments; making it clear that they\r\nmust bestir themselves and improve their flat burners if they would\r\narrest disaster. To be sure, several modifications of the round Argand\r\nburner had been introduced from time to time, some of them being a\r\ndistinct improvement over the flat burner, but these did not by any\r\nmeans seriously compete with electric light. And it was not until the\r\nincandescent mantle was perfected that gas as a brilliant illuminant\r\nwas able to make a stand against its new competitor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCANDESCENT GAS MANTLE\r\n\r\nIt has been known almost since the beginnings of civilization that all\r\nsolids can be made to emit light when heated to certain temperatures.\r\nSome substances were known to be peculiarly adapted to this purpose,\r\nsuch as lumps of lime, and for many years the calcium light or\r\n\"lime-light\" as it is popularly called, had been in use for special\r\npurposes, and was the most intense light known. This light is made by\r\nheating a block of lime to the highest practicable temperature by means\r\nof a blast of oxygen and coal gas; but such lights were too complicated\r\nand expensive for general purposes. It had been determined even as\r\nearly as the beginning of the nineteenth century, however, that the\r\nhigh temperature necessary for producing this light was due in part at\r\nleast to the fact that such a large amount of material had to be raised\r\nto incandescence. It was evident, therefore, that if a small amount\r\nof some such substance as lime and magnesia could be spread out so as\r\nto present a large surface in a small space, such as is represented\r\nby basket-work, sufficient heat for making it incandescent might be\r\nobtained from an ordinary gas-and-air blowpipe.\r\n\r\nHere then was the germ of the \"mantle\" idea; and such an apparatus,\r\nknown as the Clamond mantle, which was made of threads of calcined\r\nmagnesia, was shown at the Crystal Palace Exhibition, in London, in\r\n1882. Curiously enough, this mantle and burner worked in an inverted\r\nposition, the mantle being suspended bottom upwards below the burner\r\nthrough which the blast of gas was forced. The light given by this\r\nmantle was most brilliant--little short of the older calcium light,\r\nin fact--but the device itself was too complicated to be of service\r\nfor ordinary lighting purposes. The principle was correct, but the\r\nconstruction of the mantle was defective.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a German scientist, Dr. Auer von Welsbach, who had become\r\nfamous in the scientific world for his researches on rare metals, was\r\nexperimenting with certain oxides of different metals, and developing\r\na method of handling them that finally resulted in the perfected\r\nincandescent burner in use at present. His process, which in theory at\r\nleast was not entirely original with him, was to dip an open fabric\r\nof cotton into a solution of the nitrates of the metals to be used,\r\ndrying it, and converting the nitrates into oxides by burning; the\r\ncotton fabric disappearing but leaving the skeleton of the oxide, which\r\nretained its original shape.\r\n\r\nAt the same time corresponding improvements were made in the type of\r\nburner, which is quite as essential to success as the mantle itself.\r\nIt had been found that it was absolutely essential for such a burner\r\nto give a practically non-luminous flame, as otherwise the deposit of\r\ncarbon particles will ruin the mantle. Two ways of obtaining this are\r\npossible; one by mixing a certain quantity of air with the gas before\r\ncombustion, the other to burn the gas in so thin a flame that the air\r\npermeates it freely. Several burners of both types were used at first,\r\nbut gradually the burners in which the air is mixed with the gas became\r\nthe more popular, and most of the incandescent burners now on the\r\nmarket are of this type.\r\n\r\nIn the construction of mantles at the present time, while the principle\r\nof their use remains the same as that of the lime-light, lime itself\r\nis not used, the oxides of certain other metals having proved better\r\nadapted for the purpose. Thus the Welsbach patent of 1886 covered the\r\nuse of thoria, either alone or mixed with other substances such as\r\nzirconia, alumina, magnesia, etc.; thoria being considered as having\r\na very high power of light emission. Later it was discovered that\r\npure thoria emits very little light by itself, although it possesses\r\na refractory nature that gives a stability to the mantle unequalled\r\nby any other material as yet discovered. When combined with a small\r\ntrace of the oxides of certain rare metals, however, such as uranium,\r\nterbium, or cerium, thoria mantles have a very high power of light\r\nemission, most modern mantles being composed of about ninety-nine per\r\ncent. thoria with one per cent. cerium.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary method of manufacturing such mantles, a cotton-net\r\ncylinder about eight inches long, more or less according to the size\r\nof mantle required, is made, one end being contracted by an asbestos\r\nthread. A loop of the same material, or in some cases a platinum wire,\r\nis fastened across the opening, to be used for suspending the mantle\r\nwhen in use. The cotton-thread cylinder is soaked in a solution of\r\nthe nitrates of the metals thorium and cerium, and is then wrung out\r\nto remove the excess, stretched on a conical mold, and dried. The\r\nflame of an atmospheric burner being applied to the upper part at the\r\nconstricted position, the burning extends downward, converting the\r\nnitrates into oxides, and removing the organic matter. Considerable\r\nskill is required in this part of the process, as the regular shape of\r\nthe mantle is largely dependent upon the regularity of the burning.\r\nAs a finishing process a flame is applied to the inside of the mantle\r\nafter it has cooled, to remove all traces of carbon that may remain.\r\n\r\nThe mantle is now ready for use, but is so fragile that it can scarcely\r\nbe touched without breaking, and such handling as would be necessary\r\nfor shipment would be out of the question. It is therefore strengthened\r\ntemporarily by being dipped into a mixture of collodion and castor oil,\r\nwhich, when dry, forms a firm but elastic jacket surrounding all parts.\r\nIt is this collodion jacket that is burned away when the new mantle is\r\nplaced on the burner before the gas is turned on.\r\n\r\nQuite recently the method of manufacturing mantles used by Clamond has\r\nbeen revived. In this method the cotton thread is dispensed with, the\r\nthread used being made from a paste containing the mantle material\r\nitself. The paste is placed in a proper receptacle the bottom of\r\nwhich is perforated with minute openings, and subjected to pressure,\r\nsqueezing out the material in long filaments. When dry these are wound\r\non bobbins, and, after being treated by certain chemical processes, are\r\nready for weaving into mantles. It is claimed for mantles made on this\r\nprinciple that they last much longer and retain their light-emitting\r\npower more uniformly than mantles made by the older process.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF ACETYLENE GAS\r\n\r\nWhen the incandescent mantle had been perfected so as to be an\r\neconomical as well an as efficient light-giver, the position of coal\r\ngas as an illuminant seemed again secured against the encroachments\r\nof its rivals, the arc and incandescent electric lights. But just at\r\nthis time another rival appeared in the field that not only menaced\r\nthe mantle lamp but the arc and incandescent light as well. Curiously\r\nenough, this new rival, acetylene gas, had been brought into existence\r\ncommercially by the electric arc itself. For although it had been\r\nknown as a possible illuminant for many years, the calcium carbide for\r\nproducing it could not be manufactured economically until the advent of\r\nthe electric furnace, itself the outcome of Davy's arc light.\r\n\r\nEven as early as 1836 an English chemist had made the discovery that\r\none of the by-products of the manufacture of metallic potassium would\r\ndecompose water and evolve a gas containing acetylene; and this was\r\nlater observed independently from time to time by several chemists in\r\ndifferent countries. No importance was attached to these discoveries,\r\nhowever, and nothing was done with acetylene as an illuminant until the\r\nlast decade of the nineteenth century. By this time electric furnaces\r\nhad come into general use, and it was while working with one of these\r\nfurnaces in 1892 that Mr. Thomas F. Wilson, in preparing metallic\r\ncalcium from a mixture of lime and coal, produced a peculiar mass of\r\ndark-colored material, calcium carbide, which, when thrown into water,\r\nevolved a gas with an extremely disagreeable odor. When lighted, this\r\ngas burned with astonishing brilliancy, and, as its cost of production\r\nwas extremely small, the idea of utilizing it for illuminating was at\r\nonce conceived and put into practice.\r\n\r\nThe secret of the cheap manufacture of the carbide lies in the\r\nfact that the extremely high temperature required--about 4500°\r\nFahrenheit--can be obtained economically in the electric furnace,\r\nbut not otherwise. Thus electricity created its own greatest rival\r\nas an illuminant. It followed naturally that the ideal place for\r\nmanufacturing the carbide would be at the source of the cheapest supply\r\nof electricity, and as the \"harnessed\" Niagara Falls represented the\r\ncheapest source of electric supply, this place soon became the centre\r\nof the carbide industry. Here the process of manufacture is carried out\r\non an enormous scale. In practice, lime and ground coke are thoroughly\r\nmixed in the proportion of about fifty-six parts of lime to thirty-six\r\nparts of coke. When this mixture has been subjected to the heat of the\r\nelectric furnace for a short time an ingot of pure calcium carbide is\r\nformed, surrounded by a crust of less pure material. The ingot and\r\ncrust together represent sixty-four parts of the original ninety-two\r\nparts of lime and coke, the remaining twenty-eight parts being\r\nliberated as carbon-monoxide gas.\r\n\r\nCalcium carbide as produced by this process is a dark-brown crystalline\r\nsubstance which may be heated to redness without danger or change. It\r\nwill not burn except when heated in oxygen, and will keep indefinitely\r\nif sealed from the air. Chemically it consists of one atom of lime\r\ncombined with two atoms of carbon (CaC2); and to produce acetylene\r\ngas, which is a combination of carbon and hydrogen (C2H2) it is\r\nonly necessary to bring it into contact with water, acetylene gas and\r\nslaked lime being formed. One pound of pure carbide will produce five\r\nand one half cubic feet of gas of greater illuminating power than\r\nany other known gas. The flame is absolutely white and of blinding\r\nbrilliancy, giving a spectrum closely approximating that of sunlight.\r\nThe light is so strongly actinic that it is excellent for photography.\r\n\r\nHere was a gas that could be made in any desired quantities simply by\r\nadding water to a substance costing only about three cents a pound;\r\nits cost of production, therefore, representing only about one sixth\r\nof the dollar-per-thousand-feet rate usually charged for illuminating\r\ngas in our cities. It could be used in lamps and lanterns made with\r\nspecial burners and with the simple mechanism of a small water tank\r\nwhich allowed water to drip into a receptacle holding the carbide;\r\nor--reversing the process--an apparatus that dropped pieces of carbide\r\ninto the water tanks. It was, in short, the cheapest illuminant known,\r\ngenerated by an apparatus that was simplicity itself.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, two defects in this gas: its odor was\r\nintolerable--the \"smell of decayed garlic,\" it has been aptly\r\ncalled--and when mixed with air it was highly explosive. The first of\r\nthese defects could be overcome easily; when the burner consumed all\r\nthe gas there was no odor. The second, the explosive quality, presented\r\ngreater difficulties. These were emphasized and magnified by the number\r\nof defective lamps that soon flooded the market, many of these being so\r\nbadly constructed that explosions were inevitable. As a result a strong\r\nprejudice quickly arose against the gas, some countries passing laws\r\nprohibiting its use.\r\n\r\nBut further inquiry into the cause of the frequent disasters revealed\r\nthe fact that when the burner of a lamp was constructed so that the air\r\nfor combustion was supplied after the gas issued from the jet, there\r\nwas no danger of explosion. And as lamps carefully constructed on this\r\nprinciple replaced the early ones of faulty construction, confidence\r\nin acetylene was restored. Methods were devised for supplying the gas\r\nfor house-illumination like ordinary gas, and the occupants of country\r\nhouses were afforded a means of lighting their houses on a scale of\r\nbrilliancy hitherto unapproached, yet with economy and relative safety.\r\n\r\nIt was found also that the brilliancy of the acetylene flame was of\r\nsuch intensity that it could be used, like the electric arc light, as a\r\nsearch-light. It thus furnished a simple means of supplying small boats\r\nand vehicles with such lights, which they could not otherwise have\r\nhad. It also supplied army signal-corps with an apparatus for flashing\r\nmessages--an apparatus that was ideal on account of its simplicity and\r\nsmall size.\r\n\r\nAt the Pan-American Exhibition at Buffalo the various illuminating\r\nexhibits were among the most conspicuous and attractive features. But\r\neven amid the dazzling electrical displays the Acetylene Building was\r\na noteworthy object. \"It was the most brilliantly and beautifully\r\nlighted building in the grounds,\" declared one observer. \"It sparkled\r\nlike a diamond, and was the admiration of all visitors. In it were\r\ngenerators of all types--most of them supplying the gas for their own\r\nexhibits--several being the latest exponents of the art, so simple that\r\nthey can be safely managed by unskilled labor; in fact, 'the brains are\r\nin the machines,' and when the attendant has charged them with carbide\r\nand filled them with water--given them food and drink--they will work\r\nsteadily until they need another meal.\" Indeed, these exhibits at the\r\nPan-American Exhibition demonstrated conclusively that acetylene gas\r\noccupies a field by itself as a practical illuminant.\r\n\r\nAt the same exposition a standard was established for good stationary\r\nacetylene generators for house-lighting, and the fact that a large\r\nnumber of generators fulfilled the requirements of the set of rules\r\nlaid down showed how thoroughly the problem of handling this gas has\r\nbeen solved. Some of these rules used as tests are instructive to\r\nanyone interested in the subject, and a few of them are given here.\r\nThey specified, for example, that--\r\n\r\n\"The carbide should be dropped into the water,\" the reverse process of\r\nletting the water drip on the carbide, as was done in most of the early\r\ngenerators, being condemned. \"There must be no possibility of mixing\r\nair with the acetylene gas. Construction must be such that an addition\r\nto the charge of carbide can be made at any time without affecting the\r\nlights. Generators must be entirely automatic in their action--that is\r\nto say: after a generator has been charged, it must need no further\r\nattention until the carbide has been entirely exhausted. The various\r\noperations of discharging the refuse, filling with fresh water,\r\ncharging with carbide, and starting the generator must be so simple\r\nthat the generator can be tended by an unskilled workman without danger\r\nof accident. When the lights are out, the generation of gas should\r\ncease. The carbide should be fed automatically into the water in\r\nproportion to the gas consumed.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most significant thing, showing the stage of progress that\r\nhas been made in overcoming the danger of explosions from acetylene\r\ngas, is that the use of generators meeting some such requirements as\r\nthe above is not prohibited by fire underwriters. This in itself is\r\nvery convincing evidence of their safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\nThroughout the ages primitive man had had constantly before him two\r\nsources of light other than that of the sun, moon, and stars. One\r\nof these, the fire of ordinary combustion, he could understand and\r\nutilize; the other, more powerful and more terrible, which flashed\r\nacross the heavens at times, he could not even vaguely understand, and,\r\nnaturally, did not attempt to utilize. But early in the seventeenth\r\ncentury some scientific discoveries were made which, although their\r\ndestination was not even imagined at the time, pointed the way that\r\neventually led to man's imitating in the most striking manner Nature's\r\nelectrical illumination.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Otto von Guericke, the burgomaster-philosopher of\r\nMagdeburg, in the course of his numerous experiments, had discovered\r\nsome of the properties of electricity, by rubbing a sulphur ball, and\r\namong other things had noticed that when the ball was rubbed in a\r\ndarkened room, a faint glow of light was produced. He was aware, also,\r\nthat in some way this was connected with the generation of electricity,\r\nbut in what manner he had no conception. In the opening years of the\r\nfollowing century Francis Hauksbee obtained somewhat similar results\r\nwith glass globes and tubes, and made several important discoveries\r\nas to the properties of electricity that stimulated an interest in\r\nthe subject among the philosophers of the time. Gray in England, and\r\nDufay in France, who became enthusiastic workers in the field, soon\r\nestablished important facts regarding conduction and insulation, and\r\nby the middle of the eighteenth century the production of an electric\r\nspark had become a commonplace demonstration.\r\n\r\nBut until this time it had not been demonstrated that this electric\r\nspark was actual fire, although there was no disputing the fact that\r\nit produced light. In 1744, however, this point was settled definitely\r\nby the German, Christian Friedrich Ludolff, who projected a spark\r\nfrom a rubbed glass rod upon the surface of a bowl of ether, causing\r\nthe liquid to burst into flame. A few years later Benjamin Franklin\r\ndemonstrated with his kite and key that lightning is a manifestation of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nBut neither the galvanic cell nor the dynamo had been invented at\r\nthat time, and there was no possibility of producing anything like a\r\nsustained artificial light with the static electrical machines then\r\nin use. It was not until the classic discovery of Galvani and the\r\nresulting invention of the voltaic, or galvanic, cell shortly after,\r\nthat the electric light, in the sense of a sustained light, became\r\npossible. And even then, as we shall see in a moment, such a light was\r\ntoo expensive to be of any use commercially.\r\n\r\n\r\nDAVY AND THE FIRST ELECTRIC LIGHT\r\n\r\nAs soon as Volta's great invention was made known a new wave of\r\nenthusiasm in the field of electricity swept over the world, for the\r\nconstant and relatively tractable current of the galvanic battery\r\nsuggested possibilities not conceivable with the older friction\r\nmachines. Batteries containing large numbers of cells were devised; one\r\nhaving two thousand such elements being constructed for Sir Humphry\r\nDavy at the Royal Institution, of London. By bringing two points of\r\ncarbon, representing the two poles of the battery, close together, Davy\r\ncaused a jet of flame to play between them--not a momentary spark, but\r\na continuous light--a true voltaic arc, like that seen in the modern\r\nstreet-light to-day.\r\n\r\n\"When pieces of charcoal about an inch long and one-sixth of an inch in\r\ndiameter were brought near each other (within the thirtieth or fortieth\r\nof an inch),\" wrote Davy in describing this experiment, \"a bright\r\nspark was produced, and more than half the volume of charcoal became\r\nignited to whiteness; and, by withdrawing the points from each other, a\r\nconstant discharge took place through the heated air, in a space equal\r\nto at least four inches, producing a most brilliant ascending arch of\r\nlight, broad and conical in form in the middle. When any substance was\r\nintroduced into this arch, it instantly became ignited; platina melted\r\nin it as readily as wax in a common candle; quartz, the sapphire,\r\nmagnesia, lime, all entered into fusion; fragments of diamond and\r\npoints of charcoal and plumbago seemed to evaporate in it, even when\r\nthe connection was made in the receiver of an air-pump; but there was\r\nno evidence of their having previously undergone fusion. When the\r\ncommunication between the points positively and negatively electrified\r\nwas made in the air rarefied in the receiver of the air-pump, the\r\ndistance at which the discharge took place increased as the exhaustion\r\nwas made; and when the atmosphere in the vessel supported only\r\none-fourth of an inch of mercury in the barometrical gauge, the sparks\r\npassed through a space of nearly half an inch; and, by withdrawing the\r\npoints from each other, the discharge was made through six or seven\r\ninches, producing a most brilliant coruscation of purple light; the\r\ncharcoal became intensely ignited, and some platina wire attached to\r\nit fused with brilliant scintillations and fell in large globules upon\r\nthe plate of the pump. All the phenomena of chemical decomposition were\r\nproduced with intense rapidity by this combination.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this that as far as the actual lighting-part of\r\nDavy's apparatus was concerned, it was completely successful. But the\r\nsource of the current--the most essential part of the apparatus--was\r\nsuch that even the wealthy could hardly afford to indulge in it as a\r\nluxury. The initial cost of two thousand cells was only a small item of\r\nexpense compared with the cost of maintaining them in working order,\r\nand paying skilled operators to care for them. So that for the moment\r\nno practical results came from this demonstration, conclusive though\r\nit was, and the introduction of a commercial electric light was of\r\nnecessity deferred until a cheaper method of generating electricity\r\nshould be discovered.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was not made for another generation, but then, as\r\nseems entirely fitting, it was made by Davy's successor and former\r\nassistant at the Royal Institution, Sir Michael Faraday. His discovery\r\nof electromagnetic induction in 1831 for the first time made possible\r\nthe electric dynamo, although still another generation passed before\r\nthis invention took practical form. In the meantime, however, the\r\nmagneto-electric machine of Nollet was used for generating an electric\r\ncurrent for illuminating purposes as early as 1863; and when finally\r\nthe dynamo-electric machine was produced by Gramme in 1870, engineers\r\nand inventors had at their disposal everything necessary for producing\r\na practical electric illuminant.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that inventors stood by patiently\r\nwith folded hands waiting for the coming of a machine that would\r\nfurnish them with an adequate current without attempting to produce\r\nelectric lamps. On the contrary, they were constantly wrestling with\r\nthe problem, in some instances being fairly successful, even before the\r\ninvention of the magneto-electric machine. Great advances had been made\r\nin batteries and cell construction over the primitive cells of the time\r\nof Davy, and for exhibition purposes, and even for lighting factories\r\nand large buildings, fairly good electric lights had been used before\r\n1863.\r\n\r\nThe first practical application of electric lighting seems to have\r\nbeen made in France in 1849. During the production of the opera \"The\r\nProphet\" the sun was to appear, and for this purpose an electric arc\r\nlight was used. The success of this effort--an artificial sun being\r\nproduced that seemed almost as dazzling to the astonished audience as\r\nOld Sol himself--stimulated further efforts in the same direction. The\r\nprevious year W. E. Staite in England made experiments along similar\r\nlines in the large hall of the hotel of Sunderland. He generated a\r\nlight \"resembling the sun, or the light of day, and making candles\r\nappear as obscure as they do by daylight,\" according to the _Times_ of\r\nthe following morning. The electric light was therefore proved to be a\r\npractical illuminator, although it was not until the introduction of\r\nthe Gramme dynamo-electric machine that its great economic utility was\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JABLOCHKOFF CANDLE\r\n\r\nIn Sir Humphry Davy's experiments with his arc light he was led to\r\nbelieve that the light between the two points of carbon would be\r\nproduced even in an absolute vacuum, if it were possible to create one.\r\nSeveral scientists at the time disputed this contention, and M. Masson,\r\nProfessor of Physics in the _École Centrale des Arts et Manufactures_\r\nin Paris was particularly active in combatting the idea, maintaining\r\nthat the arc had the same cause as the electric spark--the transport\r\nby electricity of the incandescent particles of the electrodes through\r\nthe atmosphere. It was certain, at any rate, that no light was produced\r\nwhen the opposing carbons were brought into contact with each other,\r\nor were, on the other hand, separated too widely; and since there\r\nwas a constant wearing away and shortening of the points, and thus\r\na constantly increasing space between them, the great difficulty in\r\nmaking a practical lamp lay in regulating this distance automatically.\r\nIt was finally accomplished, however, by the invention of a Russian\r\nofficer, M. Jablochkoff, in 1876. The \"Jablochkoff candle,\" as his\r\nlamp was called, marked an epoch in the history of electric lighting.\r\nOne great merit of this invention was its simplicity, and while it\r\nhas long since gone out of use, having been superseded by still\r\nsimpler and better devices, it must always be recalled as an important\r\nstepping-stone in the progress of artificial illumination.\r\n\r\nThe name \"candle\" for Jablochkoff's lamp was suggested by the fact\r\nthat the two carbons were placed side by side, instead of point to\r\npoint, the light at the top thus suggesting a candle. Between these\r\ntwo carbons, and extending their whole length except at the very tips,\r\nwas an insulating material that the arc could not pierce, but which\r\nburned away at a rate commensurate with the shortening of the carbons.\r\nIn this manner the points were kept constantly at the proper distance\r\nwithout regulating-machinery of any kind. This ingenious apparatus\r\nhad the additional advantage that it could be placed on any kind of a\r\nbracket or chandelier that was properly wired, thus dispensing with the\r\ncumbersome frames and machines of the point-to-point carbon arc lights\r\nthen being introduced.\r\n\r\nOne difficulty at first encountered in using the Jablochkoff candle was\r\nthe starting of the voltaic arc. In doing this it was necessary that\r\ncontact be made between two carbon points, whether they lie parallel or\r\npoint to point, and the necessary slight separation for producing the\r\nlight effected later. To accomplish this Jablochkoff joined the tips of\r\nthe carbons of his candle with a thin strip of carbon, which quickly\r\nburned away when the current was turned on, leaving the necessary space\r\nbetween the points for the arc.\r\n\r\nThere was one difficulty with the \"candle\" that seemed insurmountable\r\nfor a time--the wasting of the two carbons was unequal, as in any arc\r\nlight, the points thus gradually drawing apart until the passage of the\r\ncurrent was no longer possible. To overcome this the rapidly wasting\r\npositive carbon was made double the thickness of its mate; but while\r\nthis answered fairly well the thinner negative carbon gradually became\r\nheated by the increased resistance, and burned up too rapidly. The\r\ndifficulty was finally overcome by the simple expedient of alternating\r\nthe flow of the current, so that each carbon was alternately a\r\npositive and a negative pole. As the magneto-electric machines then in\r\nuse produced alternating currents it was only necessary to use such\r\nmachines for generating the current to produce an equal destruction of\r\nboth carbons.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity and excellence of the light of these \"candles\" brought\r\nthem at once into general popularity, not only in the large cities of\r\nEurope, but in many out-of-the-way places. Greece, Portugal, and other\r\nobscure European countries adopted them, and even Brazil, La Plata,\r\nand Mexico installed many plants. But stranger still, they were soon\r\nused for illuminating the palaces of the Shah of Persia and the King\r\nof Cambodia, and a little later were introduced into the residence of\r\nthe savage King of Burma. In short, their use became universal almost\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IMPROVED ARC LIGHT\r\n\r\nAbout the time that Jablochkoff's candles were making such a sensation\r\nin Europe, Charles F. Brush, of Cleveland, Ohio, invented an arc light\r\nin which the carbons were set point to point, the distance being\r\nmaintained and the necessary feed produced automatically in much the\r\nsame manner as in the lamps used at present. Other inventions soon\r\nfollowed, some of the lamps being regulated by clockwork, some by\r\nelectricity and magnetism.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this type of arc lamp over the candle type--an\r\nadvantage that led to its general adoption--was largely that of\r\nefficiency, a far greater amount of light being obtainable from the\r\nsame expenditure of power by the point-to-point type of lamp.\r\n\r\nIn this lamp it is necessary that the points of carbon shall come in\r\ncontact when the current is off, but be drawn apart a moment after the\r\ncurrent is turned on, and remain at this fixed distance. To accomplish\r\nthis, the lower carbon is usually made stationary, the feeding being\r\nregulated by the position of the upper carbon. In the usual type of\r\nmodern lamp the passage of the current causes the points to separate\r\nthe required distance through the action of an electromagnet the coils\r\nof which are traversed by the current. A clutch holds the carbon in\r\nplace, the position of this being also determined by an electromagnet.\r\nThe action is regulated by the difference in the resistance to the\r\npassage of the current caused by the increase in the separation of the\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nIn the older type of arc lamp it was necessary to \"trim\" the lights by\r\nreplacing the carbons every day; but recently lamps have been perfected\r\nin which the carbons last from one hundred to one hundred and twenty\r\nhours. In these the arc is enclosed in a glass globe which is made as\r\nnearly air-tight as possible with the necessary feed devices. This\r\nclosed chamber is fitted with a valve opening outward, which allows\r\nthe air to be forced out by the heat of the lamp, but does not admit a\r\nreturn current. In this manner a rarefied chamber is produced in which\r\nthe carbons are oxidized very slowly; yet there is no diminution in the\r\nbrilliancy of the light.\r\n\r\nEarly in the history of electric lighting it became apparent that the\r\nproper construction of the carbon electrodes was a highly important\r\nitem in the manufacture of a lighting apparatus. The value of carbons\r\ndepends largely upon their purity and freedom from ash in burning, and\r\nit required a countless number of experiments to develop the highly\r\nefficient carbons now in general use. Davy made use of pieces of wood\r\ncharcoal in his experiments, but these were too fragile to be of\r\npractical value, even if their other qualities had been ideal. Later\r\nexperimenters tried various compounds, and in 1876 Carré in France\r\nproduced excellent carbons made of coke, lampblack, and syrup. From\r\nthese were developed the present carbons, usually made by mixing some\r\nfinely divided form of carbon, such as soot or lampblack made from\r\nburning paraffin or tar, with gum or syrup to form a paste. Rods of\r\nproper size and shape are made by forcing this paste through dies by\r\nhydraulic pressure, subsequently baking them at a high temperature.\r\nSometimes they are given a coating of copper, a thin layer of the metal\r\nbeing deposited upon them by electrolysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDISON AND THE INCANDESCENT LAMP\r\n\r\nThe familiar incandescent electric-light bulb seems such a simple\r\napparatus to-day, being nothing apparently but a small wire enclosed in\r\nan ordinary glass bulb, that it is almost impossible to realize what\r\nan enormous amount of money, energy, and that particular quality of\r\nmentality which we call \"genius\" has been required to produce it. First\r\nand foremost among the names of the men of genius who finally evolved\r\nthis lamp is that of Thomas A. Edison; and only second to this foremost\r\nname are those of Swan, Lane-Fox, and Hiram Maxim. But Edison's name\r\nmust stand preeminent; and there are probably very few, even among\r\nEuropeans, who would attempt or wish to deny him the enviable place as\r\nthe actual perfecter of the incandescent-light bulb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS A. EDISON AND THE DYNAMO THAT GENERATED THE FIRST\r\nCOMMERCIAL ELECTRIC LIGHT.]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Edison first conceived the idea of an incandescent\r\nelectric light while on a trip to the Rocky Mountains in company\r\nwith Draper, in 1878. Be this as it may, he certainly set to work\r\nimmediately after completing this journey, and never relaxed or ceased\r\nhis efforts until a practical incandescent lamp had been produced. His\r\nidea was to perfect a lamp that would do everything that gas could do,\r\nand more; a lamp that would give a clear, steady light, without odor,\r\nor excessive heat such as was given by the arc lights--in short, a\r\nhousehold lamp.\r\n\r\nEarly in his experiments he abandoned the voltaic arc, deciding that\r\na successful lamp must be one in which incandescence is produced by a\r\nstrong current in a conductor, the heat caused by the resistance to\r\nthe current producing the glow and light. But when search was made for\r\na suitable substance possessing the necessary properties to be the\r\nincandescent material, the inventor was confronted by a vast array of\r\ndifficulties. It was of course essential that the substance must remain\r\nincandescent without burning, and at the same time offer a resistance\r\nto the passage of the current precisely such as would bring about\r\nthe heating that produced incandescence. It should be infusible even\r\nunder this high degree of heat, or otherwise it would soon disappear;\r\nand it must not be readily oxidizable, or it would be destroyed as\r\nby ordinary combustion. It should also be of material reducible to\r\na filament as fine as hair, but capable of preserving a rigid form.\r\nThese, among others, were the qualities to be considered in selecting\r\nthis apparently simple filament for the incandescent lamp. It was not a\r\ntask for the tyro, therefore, that Edison undertook when he began his\r\nexperiments for producing an \"ideal lamp.\"\r\n\r\nThe substance in nature that seemed to possess most of the necessary\r\nqualities just enumerated was the metal platinum, and Edison began\r\nat once experimenting with this. He made a small spiral of very fine\r\nplatinum wire, which he enclosed in a glass globe about the size of an\r\nordinary baseball. The two ends of the wires connected with outside\r\nconducting wires, which were sealed into the base of the bulb. The air\r\nin the bulb had to be exhausted and a vacuum maintained to diminish the\r\nloss of heat and of electricity and to prevent the oxidation of the\r\nplatinum. But when the current was passed through the spiral wire in\r\nthis vacuum a peculiar change took place in the platinum itself. The\r\ngases retained in the pores of the metal at once escaped, and the wire\r\ntook on such peculiar physical properties that it was supposed for a\r\ntime by some physicists that a new metal had been produced. The metal\r\nacquired a very high degree of elasticity and became susceptible of a\r\nhigh polish like silver, at the same time becoming almost as hard as\r\nsteel. It also acquired a greater calorific capacity so that it could\r\nbe made much more luminous without fusing. To diminish the loss of\r\nheat the wire was coated with some metallic oxide, and the slope of\r\nthe spiral also aided in this as each turn of the spiral radiated heat\r\nupon its neighbor, thus utilizing a certain amount that would otherwise\r\nhave been lost. But despite all this, Edison found, after tedious\r\nexperimenting, that platinum did not fulfil the requirements of a\r\npractical filament for his lamp; it either melted or disintegrated in a\r\nshort time and became useless; and the other experimenters had met with\r\nthe same obstacles to its use, and were forced to the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nSome other substance must be found. The use of carbon for arc lights\r\nand Edison's own experiments with carbon in his work on the telephone\r\nnaturally suggested this substance as a possibility. It is said that\r\nthis idea was brought forcibly to the inventor's attention by noticing\r\nthe delicate spiral of vegetable carbon left in his hand after using\r\na twisted bit of paper, one day, for lighting a cigar. This spiral of\r\ncarbon was, of course, too fragile to be of use in its ordinary form.\r\nBut it occurred to Edison that if a means of consolidating it could\r\nbe found, there was reason to hope that it would answer the purpose.\r\nExperiments were begun at once, therefore, not only with processes of\r\nconsolidation but also with various kinds of paper, and neither effort\r\nnor expense was spared to test every known variety of paper. Moreover,\r\nmany new varieties of paper were manufactured at great expense from\r\nsubstances having peculiar fibres. One of these, made from a delicate\r\ncotton grown on some little islands off South Carolina, gave a carbon\r\nfree from ash, and seemed to promise good results; but later it was\r\nfound that the current of electricity did not circulate through this\r\nsubstance with sufficient regularity to get protracted and uniform\r\neffects. Nevertheless, since many things pointed to this fibre carbon\r\nas the ideal substance, Edison set about determining the cause of the\r\nirregularity in the circulation of the current in the filament, and a\r\nnumber of other experimenters soon became interested in the problem.\r\n\r\nIt was soon determined that the arrangement of the fibres themselves\r\nwere directly responsible for the difficulty. In ordinary paper the\r\nfibres are pressed together without any special arrangement, like wool\r\nfibres in felting. In passing through such a substance, therefore, the\r\ncurrent cannot travel along a continuous fibre, but must jump from\r\nfibre to fibre, \"like a man crossing a brook on stepping-stones.\" Each\r\npiece of fibre constitutes a lamp or miniature voltaic arc, so that the\r\ncurrent is no longer a continuous one; and the little interior sparks\r\nthus generated quickly destroy the filament. This discovery made it\r\napparent that such an artificial, feltlike substance as paper could not\r\nbe made to answer the purpose, and Edison set about searching for some\r\nnatural substance having fibres sufficiently long to give the necessary\r\nhomogeneity for the passage of the current.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose specimens of all the woods and fibre-substances of\r\nall countries were examined. Special agents were sent to India, China,\r\nJapan, South America, in quest of peculiar fibrous substances. The\r\nvarious woods thus secured were despatched to the Edison plant at Menlo\r\nPark and there carefully examined and tested. Without dwelling on the\r\nendless details of this tedious task, it may be said at once that only\r\nthree substances out of all the mass withstood the tests reasonably\r\nwell. Of these, a species of Japanese bamboo was found to answer the\r\npurpose best. Thus the practical incandescent lamp, which had cost so\r\nmuch time, ingenuity, and money, came into existence, fulfilling the\r\nexpectation of the most sanguine dream of its inventor.\r\n\r\nIn using these bamboo carbon filaments the original spiral form of\r\nfilament was abandoned, the now familiar elongated horseshoe being\r\nadopted, as the carbon could not be bent into the tortuous shapes\r\npossible with platinum. Later various modifications in the shape of the\r\nfilament were made, usually as adaptations to changes in the shape of\r\nthe bulbs.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Edison was succeeding with his bamboo carbon\r\nfilaments, J. W. Swan had been almost as successful with a filament\r\nformed by treating cotton thread with sulphuric acid, thus producing a\r\n\"parchmentized thread,\" which was afterwards carbonized. A modification\r\nof this process eventually supplanted the Edison bamboo filament; and\r\nthe filament now in common use--the successor of the \"parchmentized\r\nthread\"--is made of a form of soluble cellulose prepared by dissolving\r\npurified cotton wool in a solution of zinc chloride, and then pressing\r\nthe material out into long threads by pressing it through a die.\r\n\r\nThe long thread so obtained is a semi-transparent substance, resembling\r\ncatgut, which when carbonized at a high temperature forms a very\r\nelastic form of carbon filament. To prepare the filament the cellulose\r\nthreads are cut into the proper lengths, bent into horseshoe shape,\r\ndouble loops, or any desired form, and then folded round carbon formers\r\nand immersed in plumbago crucibles. On heating these crucibles to a\r\nhigh temperature the organic matter of the filaments is destroyed,\r\nthe carbon filaments remaining. These filaments are then ready for\r\nattachment to the platinum leading-in wires, which is accomplished\r\neither by means of a carbon cement or by a carbon-depositing process.\r\nThey are then placed in the glass bulbs and the wires hermetically\r\nsealed, after which the bulbs are exhausted, tested, fitted with the\r\nfamiliar brass collars, and are ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe combined discoveries of all experimenters had made it evident\r\nthat certain conditions were necessary to success, regardless of\r\nthe structure of the carbon filament. It was essential that the\r\nvessel containing the filament should be entirely of glass; that the\r\ncurrent should be conveyed in and out this by means of platinum wires\r\nhermetically sealed through the glass; and that the glass globe must\r\nbe as thoroughly exhausted as possible. This last requirement proved\r\na difficult one for a time, but by improved methods it finally became\r\npossible to produce almost a perfect vacuum in the bulbs, with a\r\ncorresponding increase in the efficiency of the lamps.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUNGSTEN LAMP\r\n\r\nFor twenty years the carbon-filament lamp stood without a rival.\r\nBut meanwhile the science of chemistry was making rapid strides and\r\nputting at the disposal of practical inventors many substances hitherto\r\nunknown, or not available in commercial quantities. Among these were\r\nthree metals, osmium, tantalum, and tungsten, and these metals soon\r\nmenaced the apparently secure position of the highly satisfactory,\r\nalthough expensive, Edison lamp.\r\n\r\nIt will be recalled that the early experimenters had used two metals,\r\nplatinum and iridium, for lamp filaments; and that these two, although\r\nunsatisfactory, were the only ones that had given even a promise\r\nof success. But in 1898 Dr. Auer von Welsbach took out patents, and\r\nin 1903 produced a lamp using an osmium filament. Its advent marked\r\nthe beginning of the return to metal-filament lamps, although the\r\nlamp itself did not prove to be very satisfactory and was quickly\r\ndisplaced by a lamp invented by Messrs. Siemens and Halske, having\r\na tantalum filament. On account of its ease to manufacture, its\r\nbrilliant light, and relatively low consumption of power, this lamp\r\ngained great popularity at once, and for a single year was practically\r\nwithout a rival. Then, in 1904, patents were taken out by Just and\r\nHanaman, Kuzel, and Welsbach, for lamps using filaments of tungsten,\r\nand the superiority of these lamps over the tantalum lamps gave\r\nthem an immediate popularity never attained by either of the other\r\nmetal-filament lamps.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say there is good ground for this popularity, which may be\r\nexplained by the simple statement that the tungsten lamp gives more\r\nlight with much less consumption of power per candle power than any of\r\nits predecessors. Unlike the carbon filament, which projects in the\r\nfamiliar elongated horse-shoe loop, or double loop, into the exhausted\r\nbulb, the tungsten filament is wound on a frame, so that several\r\nfilaments (usually eight or more) are used for producing the light\r\nin each bulb. The chief defect of this lamp is the fragility of the\r\nfilament, which breaks easily when subjected to mechanical vibration.\r\nOn the other hand, tungsten lamps can be used in places at a long\r\ndistance from the central generating plant, where the electric current\r\nis too weak for carbon-filament lamps.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MERCURY-VAPOR LIGHT OF PETER COOPER HEWITT\r\n\r\n\"On an evening in January, 1902, a great crowd was attracted to the\r\nentrance of the Engineers' Club in New York city. Over the doorway\r\na narrow glass tube gleamed with a strange blue-green light of such\r\nintensity that print was easily readable across the street, and yet\r\nso softly radiant that one could look directly at it without the\r\nsensation of blinding discomfort which accompanies nearly all brilliant\r\nartificial lights. The hall within, where Mr. Hewitt was making the\r\nfirst public announcement of his great discovery, was also illuminated\r\nby the wonderful new tubes. The light was different from anything ever\r\nseen before, grateful to the eyes, much like daylight, only giving the\r\nface a curious, pale-green, unearthly appearance. The cause of this\r\nphenomenon was soon evident; the tubes were seen to give forth all the\r\nrays except red,--orange, yellow, green, blue, violet,--so that under\r\nits illumination the room and the street without, the faces of the\r\nspectators, the clothing of the women, lost all their shades of red;\r\nindeed, changing the face of the world to a pale green-blue.\r\n\r\n\"The extraordinary appearance of this lamp and its profound\r\nsignificance as a scientific discovery at once awakened a wide\r\npublic interest, especially among electricians who best understood\r\nits importance. Here was an entirely new sort of electric light.\r\nThe familiar incandescent lamp, though the best of all methods of\r\nillumination, is also the most expensive. Mr. Hewitt's lamp, though\r\nnot yet adapted to all the purposes served by the Edison lamp, on\r\naccount of its peculiar color, produces eight times as much light with\r\nthe same amount of power. It is also practically indestructible, there\r\nbeing no filament to burn out; and it requires no special wiring. By\r\nmeans of this invention electricity, instead of being the most costly\r\nmeans of illumination becomes the cheapest--cheaper even than kerosene.\r\nNo further explanation than this is necessary to show the enormous\r\nimportance of this invention.\"\r\n\r\nAs just stated, the defect of the Edison incandescent lamp is its\r\ncost, due to its utilizing only a small fraction of the power used\r\nin producing the incandescence, and, of much less importance, the\r\nrelatively short life of the filament itself. Only about three per\r\ncent. of the actual power is utilized by the light, the remaining\r\nninety-seven per cent. being absolutely wasted; and it was this\r\nenormous waste of energy that first attracted the attention of Mr.\r\nHewitt, and led him to direct his energies to finding a substitute that\r\nwould be more economical. A large part of the waste in the Edison bulb\r\nis known to be due to the conversion of the energy into useless heat,\r\ninstead of light, as shown by the heated glass. Mr. Hewitt attempted to\r\nproduce a light that would use up the power in light alone--to produce\r\na cool light, in short.\r\n\r\nInstead of directing his efforts to the solids, Mr. Hewitt turned his\r\nattention to gaseous bodies, believing that an incandescent gas would\r\nprove the more nearly ideal substance for a cool light. The field of\r\nthe passage of electricity through gases was by no means a virgin\r\none, but was nevertheless relatively unexplored: and Mr. Hewitt was,\r\ntherefore, for the most part obliged to depend upon his own researches\r\nand experiments. In these experiments hundreds of gases were examined,\r\nsome of them giving encouraging results, but most of them presenting\r\ninsurmountable difficulties. Finally mercury vapor was tried, with the\r\nresult that the light just referred to was produced.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of mercury-vapor gas had long been vaguely\r\nsuspected--suspected, in fact, since the early days of electrical\r\ninvestigation, two centuries before. The English philosopher, Francis\r\nHauksbee, as early as 1705 had shown that light could be produced by\r\npassing air through mercury in an exhausted receiver. He had discovered\r\nthat when a blast of air was driven up against the sides of the glass\r\nreceiver, it appeared \"all round like a body of fire, consisting of an\r\nabundance of glowing globules,\" and continuing until the receiver was\r\nabout half full of air. Hauksbee called this his \"mercurial fountain,\"\r\nand although he was unable to account for the production of this\r\npeculiar light, which he remarked \"resembled lightning,\" he attributed\r\nit to the action of electricity.\r\n\r\nBetween Hauksbee's \"mercurial fountain\" and Hewitt's mercury-vapor\r\nlight, however, there is a wide gap, and, as it happened, this gap\r\nis practically unbridged by intermediate experiments, for Mr. Hewitt\r\nhad never chanced to hear anything of Hauksbee's early experiments,\r\nor of any of the tentative ones of later scientists. But this, on the\r\nwhole, may have been rather advantageous than otherwise, as, being\r\nignorant, he was perhaps in a more receptive state of mind than if\r\nhampered by false or prejudicial conceptions. Be this as it may, he\r\nbegan experimenting with mercury confined in a glass tube from which\r\nthe air had been exhausted, the mercury being vaporized either by\r\nheating, or by a current of electricity. No results of any importance\r\ncame of his numerous experiments for a time, but at last he made the\r\nall-important discovery that once the high resistance of the cold\r\nmercury was overcome, a comparatively weak current would then be\r\nconducted, producing a brilliant light from the glow of the mercury\r\nvapor. Here, then, was the secret of the use of mercury vapor for\r\nlighting--a powerful current of electricity for a fraction of a second\r\npassed through the vapor to overcome the initial resistance, and then\r\nthe passage of an ordinary current to produce the light.\r\n\r\nIn practice this apparent difficulty in overcoming the initial\r\nresistance with a strong current is easily overcome by the use of a\r\n\"boosting coil,\" which supplies the strong current for an instant, and\r\nis then shut off automatically, the ordinary current continuing for\r\nproducing the light. The mechanism is hardly more complex than that of\r\nthe ordinary incandescent light, but the current of ordinary strength\r\nproduces an illumination about eight times as intense as the ordinary\r\nincandescent bulb of equal candle-power.\r\n\r\nThe form of lamp used is that of a long, horizontal tube suspended\r\noverhead in the room, a brilliant light being diffused, which, lacking\r\nthe red rays of ordinary lights, gives a bluish-green tone to objects,\r\nand a particularly ghastly and unpleasant appearance to faces and\r\nhands, as referred to a moment ago. In many ways this feature of the\r\nlight is really a peculiarity rather than a defect, and for practical\r\npurposes in work requiring continued eye-strain the absence of the\r\nred rays is frequently advantageous. In such close work as that of\r\npen-drawing, for example, some artists find it advantageous to use\r\nglobes filled with water tinted a faint green color, placed between\r\nthe lamps and their paper, the effect produced being somewhat the same\r\nas that of the mercury-vapor light. For such work the absence of the\r\nred rays of the Hewitt light would not be considered a defect; and in\r\nworkshops and offices where Mr. Hewitt's lamps are used the workmen\r\nhave become enthusiastic over them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the fact that the color-values of objects are so\r\ncompletely changed makes this light objectionable for ordinary use;\r\nso much so, in fact, that the inventor was led to take up the problem\r\nof introducing red rays in some manner so as to produce a pure white\r\nlight. He has partly accomplished this by means of pink cloth colored\r\nwith rhodium thrown around the glass; but this causes a distinct loss\r\nof brilliancy.\r\n\r\nThe most natural method of introducing the red rays, it would seem,\r\nwould be to use globes of red glass; but a moment's reflection will\r\nshow that this would not solve the difficulty. Red glass does not\r\nchange light waves, but simply suppresses all but the red rays; and\r\nsince there are no red rays in the mercury-vapor light the result of\r\nthe red globe would be to suppress all the light. Obviously, therefore,\r\nthis apparently simple method does not solve the difficulty; but those\r\nfamiliar with Mr. Hewitt's work will not be surprised any day to hear\r\nthat he has finally overcome all obstacles, and produced a perfectly\r\nwhite light. In the meantime the relatively expensive arc light and\r\nthe incandescent bulb with its filament of carbon or metal hold\r\nunchallenged supremacy in the commercial field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nTHE MINERAL DEPTHS\r\n\r\n\r\nAges before the dawn of civilization, primitive man had learned to\r\nextract certain ores and metals from the earth by subterranean mining.\r\nSuch nations as the Egyptians, for example, understood mining in most\r\nof its phases, and worked their mines in practically the same manner as\r\nall succeeding nations before the time of the introduction of the steam\r\nengine. The early Britons were good miners and the products of their\r\nmines were carried to the Orient by the Phoenicians many centuries\r\nbefore the Christian era. The Romans were, of course, great miners, and\r\nremains of the Roman mines are still in existence, particularly good\r\nexamples being found in Spain.\r\n\r\nEven the aborigines of North America possessed some knowledge of\r\nmining, as attested by the ancient copper mines in the Lake Superior\r\nregion, although by the time of the discovery of America, and probably\r\nmany centuries before, the interloping races of Indians who had driven\r\nout or exterminated the Lake Superior copper mines had forgotten the\r\nart of mining, if indeed they had ever learned it. But the fact that\r\ntheir predecessors had worked the copper mines is shown by the number\r\nof stone mining implements found in the ancient excavations about Lake\r\nSuperior, these implements being found literally by cart loads in some\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe great progress in mining methods, however, as in the case of most\r\nother mechanical arts, began with the introduction of steam as a means\r\nof utilizing energy; and another revolution is in rapid progress owing\r\nto the perfection of electrical apparatus for furnishing power, heat,\r\nand light. Methods of mining a hundred years ago were undoubtedly\r\nsomewhat in advance of the methods used by the ancients; but the\r\ngap was not a wide one, and the progress made by decades after the\r\nintroduction of steam has been infinitely greater than the progress\r\nmade by centuries previous to that time.\r\n\r\nThis progress, of course, applies to all kinds of mines and all phases\r\nof mining; but steam and electricity are not alone responsible for\r\nthe great nineteenth-century progress. Geology, an unknown science\r\na century ago, has played a most active and important part; and\r\nchemistry, whose birth as a science dates from the opening years of the\r\nnineteenth century, is responsible for many of the great advances.\r\n\r\nObviously a very important feature of any mine must be its location,\r\nand the determination of this must always constitute the principal\r\nhazard in practical mining. Prospecting, or exploring for suitable\r\nmining sites, has been an important occupation for many years, and\r\nhas in fact become a scientific one recently. Formerly mines were\r\nfrequently stumbled upon by accident, but such accidental discoveries\r\nare becoming less and less frequent. The prospector now draws largely\r\nupon the knowledge of the scientist to aid him in his search. Geology,\r\nfor example, assists him in determining the region in which his mines\r\nmay be found, if it cannot actually point out the location for sinking\r\nhis shaft; and at least a rough knowledge of botany and chemistry\r\nis an invaluable aid to him. It is obvious that it would be useless\r\nto prospect for coal in a region where no strata of rocks formed\r\nduring the Carboniferous or coal-forming age are to be found within a\r\nworkable distance below the surface of the earth. The prospector must,\r\ntherefore, direct his efforts within \"geological confines\" if he would\r\nhope to be successful, and in this he is now greatly aided by the\r\ngeological surveys which have been made of almost every region in the\r\nUnited States and Europe.\r\n\r\nAn example of what science has done in this direction was shown a few\r\nyears ago in a western American town during one of the \"oil booms\"\r\nthat excited so many communities at that time. In the neighborhood\r\nof this town evidences of oil had been found from time to time--some\r\nof them under peculiar and suspicious circumstances, to be sure--and\r\nthe members of the community were in an intense state of excitement\r\nover the possibility of oil being found on their lands. Prices of land\r\njumped to fabulous figures, and the few land-owners that could be\r\ninduced to part with their farms became opulent by the transactions. An\r\n\"oil expert\" appeared upon the scene about this time--just \"happening\r\nto drop in\"--who declared, after an examination, that the entire region\r\nabounded in oil. He backed up his assertion by offering to stake his\r\nexperience against the capital of a company which was formed at his\r\nsuggestion. Before any wells were actually started, however, a prudent\r\nmember of the company consulted the State geologist on the subject,\r\nreceiving the assurance that no oil would be found in the neighborhood.\r\nStrangely enough the word of the man of science triumphed over that of\r\nthe \"oil expert,\" and although some tentative borings were made on a\r\nminor scale, no great amount of money was sunk. It developed afterwards\r\nthat the evidences of oil found from time to time had been the secret\r\nwork of the \"expert.\"\r\n\r\nIn general, prospecting for oil differs pretty radically from\r\nprospecting for most other minerals. A very common way of locating an\r\nore-mine is by the nature of the out-crop,--that is, the broken edges\r\nof strata of rocks protruding from hillsides, or tilted at an angle on\r\nlevel areas. If the ore-bearing vein is harder than the surrounding\r\nstrata it will be found as a jutting edge, protruding beyond the\r\nsurface of the other layers of rocks which, being softer, are more\r\neasily worn away. On the other hand, if this stratum is soft or\r\ndecomposable it will show as a depression, or \"sag\" as it is called. Of\r\ncourse such protrusions and depressions may only be seen and examined\r\nwhere the rocks themselves are exposed; vegetation, drift, and snow\r\npreventing such observations. But the vegetation may in itself serve\r\nas a guide to the experienced prospector in determining the location\r\nof a mine, peculiar mineral conditions being conducive to the growth\r\nof certain forms of vegetation, or to the arrangement of such growth.\r\nAlterations in the color of the rocks on a hillside are also important\r\nguides, as such discolorations frequently indicate that oxidizable\r\nminerals are located above.\r\n\r\nIn hilly or mountainous regions, where the underlying rocks are covered\r\nwith earth, portions of these surfaces are sometimes uncovered by the\r\nmethod known as \"booming.\" In using this method the prospector selects\r\na convenient depression near the top of a hill and builds a temporary\r\ndam across the point corresponding to the lowest outlet. When snow and\r\nrain have turned the basin so formed into a lake, the dam is burst\r\nand the water rushing down the hillside cuts away the overlying dirt,\r\nexposing the rocks beneath. This method is effective and inexpensive.\r\n\r\nThe beds of streams, particularly those in hilly and mountainous\r\nregions, are fertile fields for prospecting, particularly for precious\r\nmetals. Stones and pebbles found in the bed are likely to reveal the\r\nore-foundations along the course of the stream, and the shape of\r\nthese pebbles helps in determining the approximate location of such\r\nfoundations. An ore-bearing pebble, well worn and rounded, has probably\r\ntraveled some little distance from its original source, being rounded\r\nand worn in its passage down the stream. On the other hand, if it is\r\nstill angular it has come a much shorter distance, and the prospector\r\nwill be guided accordingly in his search for the ore-vein.\r\n\r\nBut prospecting is not limited to these simple surface methods. In\r\nenterprises undertaken on a large scale, borings are frequently made\r\nin regions where there are perhaps no specific surface indications.\r\nIn such regions a shaft may be sunk or a tunnel may be dug, and the\r\ncondition of the underlying strata thus definitely determined. This\r\nlast is, of course, a most expensive method, the simpler and more usual\r\nway being that of making borings to certain depths. The difficulty with\r\nsuch borings is that rich veins may be passed by the borer without\r\ndetection; or, on the other hand, a small vein happening to lie in the\r\nsame plane as the drill may give a wrong impression as to the extent of\r\nthe vein.\r\n\r\nOne of the most satisfactory ways of making borings is by means of the\r\ndiamond drill. This drill is made in the form of a long metal tube,\r\nthe lower edge of which is made into a cutting implement by black\r\ndiamonds fixed in the edge of the metal. By rotating this tube a ring\r\nis cut through the layers of rock, the solid cylinder or core of rock\r\nremaining in the hollow centre of the drill. This can be removed from\r\ntime to time, the nature and thickness of the geological formation\r\nthrough which the drill is passing being thus definitely determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS TO BE CONSIDERED IN MINING\r\n\r\nThree great problems always confront the mine operator--light, power,\r\nand ventilation. Of these ventilation is the most important from the\r\nworkman's standpoint, although the problem of light is scarcely\r\nless so. Obviously a cavity of the earth where hundreds of men are\r\nconstantly consuming the atmosphere and vitiating it, and where\r\nthousands of lights are burning, would become like the black hole of\r\nCalcutta in a few minutes if some means were not adopted to relieve\r\nthis condition. But besides this vitiation of the atmosphere caused by\r\nthe respiration of the men and the burning of lamps there are likely\r\nto be accumulations of poisonous gases in mines, that are even more\r\ndangerous. Of the two classes of dangerous gases--those that asphyxiate\r\nand those that explode or burn--it may be said in a general way that\r\nthe suffocating or poisonous gases, such as carbonic acid, which is\r\nknown as black damp, or choke damp, are more likely to occur in ore\r\nmines, while the explosive gases are found more frequently in coal\r\nmines.\r\n\r\nChoke damp, which is a gas considerably heavier than the atmosphere,\r\nis usually found near the bottom of mines, running along declines and\r\nfalling into holes in much the same manner as a liquid. It kills by\r\nsuffocation, and, as it will not support combustion, it may be detected\r\nby lowering a lighted candle into a suspected cavity, the light being\r\nextinguished at once if the gas is present. To rid the cavity of it,\r\nforced ventilation is used where possible, the gas being scattered by\r\ndraughts of fresh air. If this is impracticable, and the cavity small,\r\nthe choke damp may be dipped out with buckets.\r\n\r\nBut the problem of the mining engineer is not so much to rid cavities\r\nof gas as to prevent its accumulation. In modern mining, with proper\r\nventilation and drainage, there is comparatively little danger of\r\nextensive accumulation of this gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FLINT-AND-STEEL OUTFIT, AND A MINER'S STEEL MILL.\r\n\r\nThe upper picture shows a flint-and-steel outfit, the implements for\r\nlighting a fire before the days of matches. The lower picture shows a\r\nminer's steel mill, which was used for giving light in mines before the\r\nday of the safety-lamp. It consists of a steel disk which is rotated\r\nrapidly against a piece of flint, producing a stream of sparks. It was\r\nthought that such sparks would not ignite fire-damp--a belief which is\r\nnow known to be erroneous.]\r\n\r\nThe danger from this choke damp, therefore, is one that concerns the\r\nindividual workman rather than large bodies of men or the structure of\r\nthe mine itself. With fire damp, however, the case is different, as an\r\nexplosion of this gas may destroy the mine itself and all the workmen\r\nin it. It is, therefore, the most dreaded factor in mining, and is the\r\none to which more attention has been directed than to almost any other\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nThis fire damp is a mixture of carbonic oxide and marsh gas which,\r\nbeing lighter than air, tends to rise to the upper part of the mines.\r\nFor this reason explosions are more likely to occur near the openings\r\nof the mine, frequently entombing the workmen in a remote part of the\r\nmine even when not actually killing them by the explosion. As this gas\r\nis poisonous as well as explosive the miners who survive the explosion\r\nmay succumb eventually to suffocation.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1816 no means had been devised for averting the\r\nexplosions of fire damp except the uncertain one of watching the flame\r\nof the candle with which the miner was working. On coming in contact\r\nwith air mildly contaminated with fire damp the candle flame takes\r\non a blue tint and assumes a peculiarly elongated shape which may be\r\ninstantly detected by a watchful workman. But miners were, and still\r\nare, a proverbially careless class of men even where a matter of life\r\nand death is concerned, and too frequently gave no heed to the warning\r\nflame. But in 1816 Sir Humphrey Davy invented his safety lamp, a\r\ndevice that has been the means of saving thousands of lives, and which\r\nhas not as yet been entirely supplanted by any modern invention.\r\n\r\nIn making his numerous experiments, Davy had observed that iron-wire\r\ngauze is such a good conductor of heat that a flame enclosed in\r\nsuch gauze could not pass readily through meshes to ignite a gas on\r\nthe outside. He found by experiment that a considerable quantity of\r\nexplosive gas might be brought into contact with the gauze surrounding\r\na flame, and no explosion occur. At the same time this gas would give\r\nwarning of its presence by changing the color of the flame. When a\r\nlamp was made with a surrounding gauze having seven hundred and eighty\r\nmeshes to the square inch, it was found to give sufficient light and\r\nat the same time to be practically non-explosive in the presence of\r\nordinary quantities of gas.\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that such a life-saving invention would have been\r\neagerly adopted by the men whose lives it protected; but, as a matter\r\nof fact, owing to certain inconveniences of Davy's lamps, many miners\r\nrefused to use them until forced to do so by the mine-owners. One\r\nof these disadvantages was that this safety lamp gave a poor light\r\noverhead. This is particularly annoying to the miner, who wishes always\r\nto watch the condition of the ceiling under which he is working. When\r\nnot under constant observation, therefore, a miner would frequently\r\nremove the gauze of the lamp and work by the open flame, regardless\r\nof consequences. Or again, he would sometimes forgetfully use the\r\nflame for lighting his pipe. To overcome the possibility of such\r\nforgetfulness or wilful disobedience, it was found necessary to equip\r\nsafety lamps with locking devices, so that the miner had no means of\r\naccess to the open flame of his lamp once it had been lighted.\r\n\r\nSince the time of the first Davy safety lamp there have been numerous\r\nimprovements in mechanical details, although the general principle\r\nremains unchanged. One of these improvements is a device whereby the\r\nlamp, when accidentally extinguished, may be relighted without opening\r\nit, and without the use of matches. This is done by means of little\r\nstrips of paper containing patches of a fulminating substance which\r\nis ignited by friction, working on the same principle as the paper\r\npercussion caps used on toy pistols.\r\n\r\nBut even the improved safety lamp seems likely to disappear from mines\r\nwithin the next few years, now that electricity has come into such\r\ngeneral use. As yet, however, no satisfactory portable electric lamp\r\nor lantern has been perfected, such lamps being as a rule too heavy,\r\nexpensive, and unreliable. Even if these defects were remedied, the\r\nadvantage would still lie with the Davy lamp, since the electric lamp,\r\nbeing enclosed, cannot be used for the detection of fire damp. But\r\nthis advantage of the safety lamp is becoming less important, since\r\nwell-regulated mines are now more thoroughly ventilated, and the danger\r\nfrom fire damp correspondingly lessened.\r\n\r\nIn some Continental mines the experiment has been tried of constantly\r\nconsuming the fire damp, before it has had time to accumulate in\r\nexplosive quantities, by means of numerous open lights kept constantly\r\nburning. This method is effective, but since the numerous lights\r\nconsume the precious oxygen of the air as well as the damp, the method\r\nhas never become popular. Obviously, then, the question of mine\r\nventilation is closely associated with that of lighting.\r\n\r\nProbably the simplest method of properly ventilating a mine is that of\r\nhaving two openings at the surface, one on a much higher level than\r\nthe other if the mine is on a hillside, the lower one corresponding to\r\nthe lowest portion of the mine where possible. By such an arrangement\r\nnatural currents will be established, and may be controlled and\r\ndistributed through the mine by doors or permanent partitions, or aided\r\nby fans. But of course only a comparatively small number of mines are\r\nso situated that this system can be used.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, of course, to ventilate a mine from a single shaft or\r\nopening by use of double sets of pipes, one for admitting air and the\r\nother for expelling it; but this system is obviously not an ideal one,\r\nand is prohibited by law in most mining districts. Such laws usually\r\nstipulate that there must be at least two openings situated at some\r\ndistance from each other.\r\n\r\nThe older method of creating air currents was by means of furnaces,\r\nbut this method, while very effective, is expensive and dangerous. In\r\nusing this system a furnace is built near the outlet of the air shaft,\r\nthe combustion of the fuel creating the necessary draught. But in the\r\nnature of things this furnace is a constant menace to the mine, besides\r\nbeing an extremely wasteful expenditure of energy. The modern method\r\nof ventilating is by means of rotary fans, the electric fan having\r\npractically solved the problem. The air currents established by such\r\nfans are controlled either by the doors in the passages, or by means of\r\nauxiliary fans. In addition, jets of compressed air are sometimes used,\r\nand have become very popular.\r\n\r\nAnother important problem that constantly confronts the mining engineer\r\nis that of drainage. Mines are, of course, great reservoirs for the\r\naccumulation of water, which must be drained or pumped out continually;\r\nand as the shafts are sunk deeper and deeper it becomes increasingly\r\ndifficult to raise the water to the surface. Special means and\r\nmachinery are employed for this purpose which will be considered more\r\nin detail in a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC MACHINERY IN MINING\r\n\r\nElectricity is, of course, the great revolutionary factor in modern\r\nmining. There is scarcely a department of mining in which electric\r\npower has not wrought revolutionary changes in recent years; and the\r\nsubject has become so important and so thoroughly specialized as to\r\n\"create a literature and a technology of its own.\" From the electric\r\ndrill, working hundreds of feet below the surface of the earth, to the\r\ndelicate testing-instruments in the laboratory of the assaying offices,\r\nthe effect of this electrical revolution is being felt progressively\r\nmore and more every year.\r\n\r\nMoreover, electricity, on account of its transmutability, has made\r\naccessible many important mining sites hitherto unworkable. Rich mines\r\nare now in operation on an economical basis which, thirty years ago,\r\nwere worthless on account of their isolation. When such mines were\r\nsituated in mountainous regions where there was no coal supply at hand\r\nfor creating steam power, and where the only available water power was\r\nperhaps several miles away, operations on a paying basis were out of\r\nthe question before the era of electric power.\r\n\r\nAt present, however, the question of distance of the seat of power\r\nhas been practically eliminated by the possibilities of electric\r\nconduction. A stream, situated miles away, when harnessed to a turbine\r\nand electric motors may afford a source of power more economical than\r\ncould be furnished a few years ago by a power plant supplied with\r\nfuel at the very door of the mine. We need not enter into the details\r\nof this transmission of power, however, since the subject has been\r\ndiscussed in a general way in another place. Our subject here is\r\nrather to deal with the application of electricity to certain mining\r\nimplements of special importance.\r\n\r\nOne of the most useful acquisitions to the equipment of the modern\r\nminer is a portable mechanical drill, which makes it possible for\r\nhim to dispense with the time-honored pick, hammer, and hand-drill.\r\nBut it is only recently that inventors have been able to produce\r\nthis implement. The great difficulty has lain in the fact that a\r\nreciprocating motion, which is essential for certain kinds of drilling,\r\nis not readily secured with electric power. The use of steam or\r\ncompressed air for operating such reciprocating drills presents no\r\nmechanical difficulties, and the fact that power of this kind can be\r\ntransmitted long distances by the use of flexible tubes made such\r\ndrills popular for several years. But the cost of operating such drills\r\nis so much greater than that of the new electric drills that they are\r\nrapidly being replaced in mining work.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts to produce an electric drill with a reciprocating\r\nmotion were so unsuccessful that inventors turned their attention to\r\nperfecting some rotary device. This proved more successful, and rotary\r\ndrills, operating long augers and acting like ordinary wood-boring\r\nmachines, are now used extensively for certain kinds of drilling. The\r\nmore recent forms perform the same amount of work as the air drill,\r\nwith a consumption of about one-tenth the power. Moreover, none of\r\nthe energy is lost at high altitudes as in the case of air drills,\r\nand they are not affected by low temperatures which sometimes render\r\nthe air drill inoperable. On the other hand, the air drill is a hardy\r\nimplement, capable of withstanding very rough usage, whereas the\r\nelectric drill is probably the more economical, as well as the more\r\nconvenient drill of the two.\r\n\r\nIn certain kinds of mining, such as in the potash mines of Europe and\r\nthe coal mines of America, these electric drills operating their long\r\naugers have been found particularly useful. The ordinary type of drill\r\nis so arranged that it can be operated at any angle, vertically or\r\nhorizontally. The lighter forms are mounted on upright stands, with\r\nscrews at the ends for fastening to the floor and roof, although the\r\nheavier types are sometimes mounted on trucks. The motor, which is\r\nnot much larger or heavier than an ordinary fan motor, is fastened to\r\nthe upright and is from four to six horse-power. This connects with a\r\nflexible wire which transmits the power from the generating station,\r\nfrequently several miles away. The auger, which is about the largest\r\npart of the machine and entirely out of proportion to the little motor\r\nthat drives it, is simply a long bar of steel, twisted spirally at the\r\ncutting-end like an ordinary wood auger.\r\n\r\nFrom the workman's standpoint these rotary drills are infinitely\r\nsuperior to reciprocating or percussion drills, where the constant\r\njarring of the machine, besides being extremely tiresome, sometimes\r\nproduces the serious disease known as neuritis. Various means have\r\nbeen attempted to prevent this, such as by overcoming the jar in a\r\nmeasure by flexible levers which do not transmit the vibrations to the\r\nhands and arms; but such attempts are only partially successful, and\r\na certain amount of jarring cannot be avoided. In the rotary electric\r\ndrills there is none of this, the workmen simply controlling the drill\r\nand the motor with levers, and receiving at most only a slight jar from\r\nthe vibrations of the auger.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACTION IN MINING\r\n\r\nIn recent years electric traction engines for use in mines have been\r\nrapidly replacing horse-and mule-power, and have become important\r\neconomic factors in mining operations. The pioneer of this type of\r\nlocomotive seems to have been one built by Mr. W. M. Schlessinger\r\nfor one of the collieries of the Pennsylvania Railroad about 1882,\r\nand which has remained in active use ever since. The total weight of\r\nthis locomotive was five tons and it was equipped with thirty-two\r\nhorse-power electric motors. The current was supplied through a trolley\r\npole which took the current from a T-shaped rail placed above and at\r\none side of the track. The train hauled by this locomotive consisted of\r\nfifteen cars, carrying from two to three tons of coal each.\r\n\r\nFollowing this first mining-locomotive a great number were quickly\r\nproduced. In Pennsylvania alone something like four hundred are now\r\nin use, and in Illinois two million tons of coal were hauled in this\r\nmanner in twelve mines in 1901. It was estimated at the beginning of\r\nthe present century that some 3,000 electric locomotives specially\r\nbuilt for mining were in use in the United States alone.\r\n\r\nThe earlier types of mining-locomotives were much higher and bulkier\r\nthan those of more recent construction, the motors being mounted above\r\nthe trucks and geared downward. Very soon, however, the \"turtle-back\"\r\nor \"terrapin-back\" type was developed, with the motors brought close\r\nto the ground, so that even quite a heavy locomotive might not be\r\nmuch higher than the diameter of its driving-wheels. When these\r\nqueer-looking machines were boxed in so that even the wheels were\r\ncovered, they lost all resemblance to locomotives or vehicles of any\r\nkind, appearing like low, rectangular metal boxes placed upon the car\r\ntracks, that glided along the rails in some mysterious manner. The\r\npresence of the trolley pole helped to dispel this illusion, but in\r\nsome instances this is wanting, the power being taken from a third rail.\r\n\r\nWith these locomotives, some of them not more than two and a half\r\nfeet high, it was possible to haul trains even in very low and narrow\r\npassages--much lower, in fact, than could be entered by the little\r\nmules used in former years. This in itself was revolutionary in its\r\neffects, as many thin veins were thus made workable.\r\n\r\nThis type of low locomotive is the one that has come into general use\r\nthroughout the world. Such locomotives range in size from two to twenty\r\ntons, with wheel gauges from a foot and a half wide to the standard\r\nrailway gauge of four feet, eight and a half inches. Locomotives\r\nweighing more than twenty tons are not in general use on account of the\r\nsmall size of the mine entrances.\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary types the motorman sits in front, controlling the\r\nlocomotive with levers and mechanical brakes placed within easy reach,\r\nbut sunk as low as possible. As a rule, the motors are geared to the\r\ntruck axles, either inside or outside the locomotive frame. An overhead\r\ncopper wire supplies the current by contact with a grooved trolley\r\nwheel mounted on the end of the regulation trolley pole. An electric\r\nheadlight is used, and the ordinary speed attained by the compact\r\nmotors is from six to ten miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe amount of work that can be performed by one of these little,\r\nflat, box-like locomotives is entirely out of proportion to its size.\r\nA 10-ton locomotive in a Pennsylvania mine hauled about 150,000\r\ntons of coal in a year at a cost of less than one-tenth of a cent per\r\nton for repairs. The usual train was made up of thirty-five cars,\r\neach loaded with about 3,700 pounds of coal, which was hauled up a\r\nthree-per-cent grade. The cost of such haulage was only about 2.76\r\ncents per ton, as against 7.15 cents when hauled by mule-power. These\r\nfigures may be considered representative, as other mines show similar\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOCOMOTIVE \"PUFFING BILLY\" AND A MODERN COLLIERY\r\nTROLLEY.\r\n\r\nThis locomotive was constructed in 1813 at Wylam Colliery, England,\r\nby William Hedley. It was entirely successful, and was in operation\r\nfor almost half a century, up to the time of its removal in 1862 to\r\nthe South Kensington Museum. The vertical cylinders and arrangement of\r\nwalking beams for transmitting power are particularly interesting. The\r\npower was transmitted through cogged wheels to the rear axle, as is\r\ndone with modern automobiles.]\r\n\r\nA particular advantage has been gained by the use of electric\r\nlocomotives over older methods in the process of \"gathering\" the cars.\r\nIn many coal mines, even when the main hauling is done by electricity,\r\nthe gathering or collecting of cars from the working faces of the rooms\r\nwas formerly done either by mule-power or by hand. In some low-veined\r\nmines, hand power alone was used, on account of the low roof.\r\n\r\nIn such places, low, compressed-air locomotives were sometimes used;\r\nbut these were very expensive. These have now been very generally\r\nreplaced by \"turtle-back\" electric locomotives, operated at a distance\r\nfrom the main trolley wire by means of long, flexible cables, so geared\r\nthat they can be paid out or coiled as desired.\r\n\r\nOn the main line these locomotives take the current from the trolley\r\nwire by means of the trolley pole, but when the place for gathering is\r\nreached, the connection is made by means of the flexible cable, and the\r\ntrolley pole fastened down so as not to be in the way. This allows the\r\nlocomotive to push the little cars into the rooms far removed from the\r\nmain line, with passages too low and narrow to allow the use of the\r\ntrolley pole. By the time the last cars have been delivered the first\r\ncars of the train have been filled, and the process of gathering may be\r\nbegun at once, and the loaded train made up for the return trip. With\r\nsuch a locomotive two men can distribute and gather up from one hundred\r\nto one hundred and twenty cars in an ordinary eight-hour working-day,\r\nhauling from three hundred to three hundred and fifty tons of coal.\r\n\r\nIn certain regions, a system of third-rail current-supply is used, this\r\nrail being also a tooth rail with which a cog on the locomotive works\r\nfrictionally. For climbing steep grades this system of cogged rails has\r\nmany advantages over other systems.\r\n\r\nAnother type of electric locomotive used in some mines is a\r\nself-propelling or automobile one equipped with storage batteries. Such\r\nlocomotives do away with the inconvenience and dangers of contact rails\r\nor trolley wires, but are heavy and expensive. A compromise locomotive,\r\nparticularly useful for gathering, is one equipped with both trolley\r\npole and storage batteries. This locomotive is so made that the storage\r\nbatteries are charged while it is running with the trolley connection,\r\nso that no time is lost in the charging process. Such locomotives\r\nhave been found very satisfactory for many purposes, and but for the\r\nimperfections common to all storage batteries would be ideal in many\r\nways. They can be worked over any improvised track, regardless of\r\ndistance, which is an advantage over the flexible-cable system where\r\ndistances are limited by the length of cable; and the first cost of\r\nthe battery is no more than the outlay on trolley wires and supports.\r\nIt is also claimed that the cost of maintenance is relatively low, but\r\nit is doubtful if it equals the trolley or third-rail systems in this\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the systems of traction by electric locomotives, is\r\nthe modern electric telpherage system. Until quite recently the haulage\r\nof ores and other raw materials used in mining, when done aerially,\r\nhas been by means of travelling rope or cable. When distances to be\r\ntravelled in this manner are short, such as across streams or valleys,\r\nwhere no supports are used, the term \"cableway\" is generally applied;\r\nbut where the distance is so long that supports are necessary, the term\r\n\"tramway cable\" is used. It is to these longer systems that electric\r\ntelpherage is particularly applicable.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of such an electric system over the older method is\r\nthe same as the advantages of the trolley road over the cable, all\r\nropes and cables being stationary, the electric motor, or \"telpher,\"\r\ntravelling along on one cable and taking its current by means of a\r\ntrolley pole from a wire above. For heavier work metal rails supported\r\nbetween posts are employed in place of a flexible cable, and over such\r\nsystems loads of several tons can be hauled.\r\n\r\nSuch an electric telpher system is used in one of the Cuban limestone\r\nquarries, the telpher and cars travelling a long distance upon cables,\r\nexcept at some of the curves, where solid rails are substituted,\r\nhauling a load of a thousand pounds at a speed of from twelve to\r\nfifteen miles an hour. The current comes from a distant source, and the\r\ntelpher is so arranged that it travels automatically when the current\r\nis turned on, stopping when the current is cut off. This is quite a\r\ncommon arrangement for smaller telphers, but in the larger ones a man\r\ntravels with the telpher and load, controlling the train just as in the\r\ncase of the ordinary trolley system.\r\n\r\nThe various processes of hoisting in mines by electricity is closely\r\nakin to that of traction, since, after all, \"an elevator is virtually a\r\nrailway with a 100-per-cent grade.\" As such work is done spasmodically,\r\nlong periods of rest intervening between actual periods of work, a\r\ngreat deal of energy is wasted by steam hoisting engines, where a\r\ncertain pressure of steam in the boiler must be maintained at all\r\ntimes. For this reason electrical energy for hoisting has come rapidly\r\ninto popularity in recent years. \"The throttling of steam to control\r\nspeed,\" said Mr. F. O. Blackwell in addressing the American Institute\r\nof Mining Engineers, \"the necessity for reversing the engine, the\r\nvariation in steam pressure, the absence of condensing apparatus, the\r\ncooling and large clearance of cylinders, and the condensation and\r\nleakage of steam pipes when doing no work, are all against the steam\r\nhoisting engine. One of the largest hoisting engines in the world was\r\nrecently tested and found to take sixty pounds of steam per indicated\r\nhorse-power per hour. The electric motor, on the other hand, is ideal\r\nfor intermittent work. It wastes absolutely no energy when at rest,\r\nthere being no leakage or condensation. Its efficiency is high, from\r\none-quarter load to twice full load.\"\r\n\r\nThere seems to be practically no difference as far as the element of\r\ndanger is concerned between steam and electric hoists. The difference\r\nis largely one of economy. The importance of this is shown by the\r\nrecent comparisons in a gold mine which has replaced its steam\r\napparatus by electricity. In this mine the hoist moves through the\r\nshaft at a rate of over twelve hundred feet per minute, elevating five\r\nhundred tons of ore daily on double-decked cages. It is estimated that\r\nthis system shows an efficiency of 75 per cent, taking into account\r\nlosses of all kinds, with a resulting reduction of cost of from seven\r\nto twenty dollars per horse-power per month.\r\n\r\nResults comparing very favorably with these have been obtained also\r\nin some of the mines in Germany and Bohemia, where electricity has\r\nbeen introduced extensively in mining. In one of these mines the daily\r\nhoisting capacity is twenty-seven hundred tons from a depth of over\r\nsixteen hundred feet, at a speed of over fifty-two feet per second. In\r\nthe Comstock mine, at Virginia City, Nev., electric hoists are used\r\nwhich obtain their power from a plant situated on the Truchee River\r\nthirty-two miles away.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC MINING PUMPS\r\n\r\nIn pumping, which is always one of the important items in mining, the\r\nuse of electric power has been found quite as advantageous as in the\r\nother fields of its application. No special features are embodied in\r\nmost of the types of mining pumps over the rotary and reciprocating\r\ntypes used for ordinary purposes, except perhaps a type of pump known\r\nas the sinking pump. This is a movable pump that can be easily lowered\r\nfrom one place to another, and has proved to be a great time-saver over\r\nsteam or air pumps used for similar purposes.\r\n\r\nFor some time the question of the durability of electric pumps was in\r\ndispute, but developments in quite recent years seem to prove that, in\r\nsome instances at least, such pumps are practically indestructible.\r\n\r\n\"The question of what would happen to an electric motor in a mine\r\nif pumps and motors get flooded has often come up. From tests made\r\nrecently at the University of Liège, Belgium, it appears that a\r\nsuitably designed polyphase alternating-current motor of a type largely\r\nused on the continent of Europe was completely submerged in water.\r\nIt was run for a quarter of an hour; it was then stopped and allowed\r\nto remain submerged, under official seal, for twenty-four hours, at\r\nthe end of which time it was again run for a few minutes. It was next\r\nremoved from the water, again put under seal, and left to dry for\r\ntwenty-four hours. The insulation was then tested, and the motor was\r\nfound to be in perfect order. It would be hard to imagine a test more\r\nsevere than this.\r\n\r\n\"As bearing upon this question it is interesting to note that among\r\nthe pumps in use around Johannesburg, South Africa, at the beginning\r\nof the Anglo-Boer War, there were twelve of a well-known American\r\nmake, each of which was operated by a 50-horse-power induction motor\r\nof American construction with three 15-kilowatt transformers. When the\r\nmines were shut down, upon the breaking out of the war, the water\r\nrose so rapidly that it was impossible to remove the pumps, motors,\r\ntransformers, etc., and consequently they remained under 500 to 1,000\r\nfeet of water. Two and a half years later, when peace was declared in\r\nSouth Africa, the water in the shaft was pumped out and the electrical\r\napparatus was removed to the surface. Three of the motors were stripped\r\nand completely rewound, but to the general surprise of the experts the\r\ncondition of the insulation indicated that the rewinding might not be\r\nabsolutely necessary. Accordingly the other nine motors were thoroughly\r\ndried in an oven and then soaked in oil. After this treatment they were\r\nrigidly tested, proved to be all right, and were at once restored to\r\nregular service in the mine. The transformers were treated in the same\r\nmanner as the motors, with equally gratifying results.\r\n\r\n\"An interesting illustration of the flexibility and adaptability of\r\nelectric motors for pumping purposes is furnished by the Gneisenau\r\nmine, near Dortmund, Germany, where a very large electric mining plant\r\nwas installed in 1903. In this instance the pump is located more than\r\n1,200 feet below the surface, and the difficulties of installing the\r\napparatus were so great, on account of the small cross section of the\r\nshaft, that it was necessary to build up the motor in the pumping\r\nchamber, the material being transported through the wet shaft and the\r\nwinding of the coils being performed _in situ_.\r\n\r\n\"An interesting use of the electric pump associated with the telephone\r\nin connection with mining is noted by Mr. W. B. Clarke. In one coal\r\nmine, where an electric pump is located in a worked-out portion of the\r\nmine, the circuits are so arranged that the pump is started from the\r\npower house, some distance away. Near the pump is placed a telephone\r\ntransmitter connected to a receiver in the power house. To start the\r\nmotors, or to ascertain whether the pumps are working properly, the\r\nengineer merely listens at the telephone receiver, without leaving his\r\npost.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY IN COAL MINING\r\n\r\nIn coal mining the effect of the use of electrical machinery has been\r\nrevolutionary in recent years, particularly in the development of\r\nelectric coal cutters. The old method of picking out coal by hand,\r\nwhere the miner labored with the heavy pick, working in all manner of\r\ncramped and dangerous positions, was supplanted a few years ago by\r\nthe \"puncher\" machine, worked by steam or compressed air. With these\r\nmachines the coal was picked out just as in the case of the hand\r\nmethod, except that the energy was derived from some power other than\r\nmuscular. So that while these machines worked more rapidly than the\r\nhand picks, they utilized the same general principle in applying their\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\nWithin recent years, however, various coal-cutting machines have been\r\ndevised, with which the coal was actually cut, or sawed out, these\r\nmachines being peculiarly well adapted to using the electric current.\r\nThe most practical and popular form of machine is one in which the\r\nsawing is done by an endless chain, the links of which are provided\r\nwith a cutting blade. These have been very generally replacing the\r\ncompressed-air or pick type of machine, and their popularity accounts\r\nlargely for the enormous increase in the use of coal-mining machinery\r\nduring the past decade. Thus in 1898 there were 2,622 coal-mining\r\nmachines in use in the United States. Four years later this number had\r\nmore than doubled, the increase being due largely to the adoption of\r\nchain machines.\r\n\r\nLike electric locomotives, and for similar reasons, the coal-cutting\r\nmachines are low, broad, flat machines, from eighteen to twenty-eight\r\ninches high. They rest upon a flat shoeboard that can be moved\r\neasily along the face of the coal. An ordinary machine weighs in the\r\nneighborhood of a ton, and requires two men to operate. The apparatus\r\nis described briefly as follows:\r\n\r\n\"On an outside frame, consisting of two steel channel bars and two\r\nangle irons riveted to steel cross ties, rests a sliding frame\r\nconsisting of a heavy channel or centre rail, to which is bolted the\r\ncutter head. The cutter head is made entirely of two milled steel\r\nplates, which bolt together, forming the front guide for the cutter\r\nchain. This chain, which is made of solid cast steel links connected\r\nby drop forge straps, is carried around idlers or sprockets placed at\r\neach end of the cutter head and along the chain guides at the side to\r\nthe rear of the machine, where it engages with and receives its power\r\nfrom a third sprocket, under the motor. The electric motor, which is\r\nof ironclad multipolar type, rests upon a steel carriage, which forms\r\nthe bearing for the main shaft.... A reversing switch is provided, so\r\nthat the truck can travel in either direction, and when the machine has\r\nreached its stopping point, either forward or backward, it is checked\r\nby an automatic cut-off. The return travel is made in about one-fourth\r\nof the time required to make the cut.\"\r\n\r\nIn veins of coal of a thickness from twenty-eight to thirty inches,\r\nsuch a machine will cut about one hundred tons of coal in a day. The\r\ncost of production with such machines has been estimated at about\r\nsixty-three cents a ton, as against ninety cents as the cost of pick\r\nmining in rooms,--a saving of about twenty-seven cents a ton. Since it\r\nis estimated that for a cost of $10,000 an electrical equipment can\r\nbe installed capable of working four such machines besides affording\r\npower for lighting, pumping, ventilation of the mine, etc., thus saving\r\nsomething like $100 a day for the operator, the great popularity of\r\nthese machines is readily understood.\r\n\r\nAfter such a machine has been placed in position, a cut some four feet\r\nwide, four or five inches high, and six feet deep can be made in five\r\nminutes, with the expenditure of very little energy on the part of the\r\nworkmen. One of the largest cuttings ever recorded by one of these\r\nmachines is 1,700 square feet in nine and one-half hours, although this\r\nmay have been exceeded and not recorded.\r\n\r\nAmong the several advantages claimed for the chain machine over the\r\nolder pick machines is the small amount of slack coal produced, and\r\nthe absence of the racking vibrations that exhaust the workmen, and,\r\nlike the air drills, sometimes cause serious diseases. On the other\r\nhand the advocates of the pick machines point out that they can be\r\nused in mines too narrow for the introduction of chain machines. They\r\nshow also that there is a constant element of danger from motor-driven\r\nmachines in mines where the quantity of gas present makes it necessary\r\nto use safety lamps, on account of the sparking of the machines which\r\nmay produce explosions. Both these claims are valid, but apply only\r\nto special cases, or to certain mines, and do not affect the general\r\npopularity of the chain machines.\r\n\r\nThere are several different types of chain cutting machines, such as\r\n\"long-wall machines,\" and \"shearing machines,\" but these need not be\r\nconsidered in detail here. The general principle upon which they work\r\nis the same as the ordinary chain machine, the difference being in the\r\nmethod of applying it for use in special situations.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LIGHTING OF MINES\r\n\r\nFor many obvious reasons the ideal light for mining purposes is one\r\nin which the danger from the open flame is avoided, particularly in\r\nwell-ventilated mines, or mines under careful supervision, where the\r\ndanger from inflammable gases is slight. The incandescent electric\r\nlight, therefore, has become practically indispensable in modern\r\nmining operations. For certain purposes and in certain locations where\r\nan intense light is desirable and where there is no danger from\r\ncombustible gases, arc lights are used to a limited extent. But there\r\nis constant danger from the open flame in using such lights, and also\r\nfrom the connecting wires leading to them. Furthermore, such intense\r\nlight is not usually necessary in the narrow passages of the mine.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, there is a certain element of danger even with incandescent\r\nlights on account of the possibility of breakage of the globes, and of\r\nshort-circuiting where improper wiring has been done. To overcome as\r\nmuch as possible the dangers from these sources, special precautions\r\nare taken in wiring mines, and special bulbs are used. In general the\r\nincandescent lamps as used in mining are made of stout round bulbs\r\nof thick glass which are not likely to crack from the effects of\r\nwater dripping upon them while heated. As a further protection it is\r\ncustomary to enclose the bulbs in wire cages. It is also customary to\r\nuse low-current lamps with a rather high voltage, although this must be\r\nlimited, as excessive voltage may in itself become a source of danger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF STEEL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe iron industry has of late years become more and more merged into\r\nthe steel industry, as steel has been gradually replacing the parent\r\nmetal in nearly every field of its former usefulness. Steel is so much\r\nsuperior to iron for almost every purpose and the process of making\r\nit has been so simplified by Bessemer's discovery that it may justly\r\nbe said that civilization has emerged from the Iron Age, and entered\r\nthe Age of Steel. While iron is mined more extensively now than at\r\nany time in the history of the world, the ultimate object of most of\r\nthis mining is to produce material for manufacturing steel. We still\r\nspeak of boiler iron, railroad iron, iron ships, etc., but these names\r\nare reminiscent, for in the construction of modern boilers and modern\r\nships, steel is used exclusively. In the past decade it is probable\r\nthat no railroad rails even for the smallest and cheapest of tracks\r\nhave been made of anything but steel.\r\n\r\nThe last half of the nineteenth century has been one of triumph of\r\nsteel manufacture and production in America, and at the present time\r\nthe United States stands head and shoulders above any other nation in\r\nthis industry. In the middle of the century both Germany and England\r\nwere greater producers than America; but by the close of the century\r\nthe annual output in the United States was above fifteen million tons\r\nas against England's ten and Germany's seven; and since 1900 this lead\r\nhas been greatly increased. The steel industry has become so great, in\r\nfact, that it is \"a sort of barometer of trade and national progress.\"\r\n\r\nThe great advances in the quantity of steel produced have been made\r\npossible by corresponding advances in methods of winning the iron ore\r\nfrom the earth. Mining machinery has been revolutionized at least twice\r\nduring the last half century, first by improved machines driven by\r\nsteam, and again by electricity and compressed air. Ore is still mined\r\nto a limited extent by men with picks and shovels, but these implements\r\nnow play so insignificant a part in the process that they cannot be\r\nconsidered as important factors. Steam shovels, automatic loaders and\r\nunloaders, dynamite and blasting powder, have taken the place of brawn\r\nand muscle, which is now mostly expended in directing and guiding\r\nmining machinery rather than in actually handling the ore.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAKE SUPERIOR MINES\r\n\r\nAt the present time the greatest iron-ore fields lie in the Lake\r\nSuperior region, and it is in this region that the greatest progress\r\nin mining methods has been made in recent years. There are, of course,\r\nextensive mines in other sections of the United States, but at least\r\nthree-quarters of all the iron produced in America comes from the\r\nLake Superior mines, and the systems of mining pursued there may be\r\nconsidered as representative of the most advanced modern methods.\r\n\r\nWhere the iron ore of these mines is found near the surface of the\r\nearth, the great system of \"open-pit\" mining is practised; but as only\r\na relatively small portion of the ore is so situated, modifications\r\nof older mining methods are still employed. Of these the three most\r\nimportant are known as \"overhead scooping,\" \"caving,\" and \"milling.\"\r\n\r\nIn the overhead method a shaft is sunk into the earth to a depth of\r\nseveral hundred feet, according to the depth of the ore, this shaft\r\nbeing lined with timbers for support. From this shaft horizontal\r\ntunnels are made in all directions in the ore deposits, and through\r\nthese tunnels the ore is conveyed to the shaft and thence to the\r\nsurface. As the ore is removed and the earth thus honeycombed in\r\nall directions, supports of various kinds must be made to prevent\r\ncaving. For this purpose columns of the ore itself may be left, or\r\nsupports of masonry or wood or steel may be introduced. Under certain\r\ncircumstances, however, these supports are not employed, the earth\r\nbeing allowed gradually to cave in at the surface as the ore is\r\nremoved, this being the method of mining known as \"caving.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the ore deposit occurs in a favorable hillside the \"milling\"\r\nsystem is frequently employed. In working this system a large\r\nhorizontal tunnel, twenty or more feet in diameter, is dug into the\r\nhillside. Perpendicular shafts are then sunk from the top of the hill,\r\nconnected with openings leading directly into the top of the main\r\nhorizontal shaft. By this arrangement the ore, when loosened in these\r\nperpendicular shafts, falls directly into the bins placed for its\r\nreception about the openings, or into the rows of cars in waiting to\r\nreceive it. In this method dynamite and powder take the place of hand\r\nlabor, the main mass of ore being dislodged and thrown into the shaft\r\nby blasting, instead of by hand labor.\r\n\r\nBut all these methods are overshadowed in magnitude by the great \"open\r\npit\" systems, where the ore is taken from the surface and handled\r\nentirely by machinery, the only part played by the miner's pick being\r\nthat of assisting in loosing certain fragments so that they may be\r\nmore easily seized by the machines. Indeed, this system of mining\r\npartakes of the nature of quarrying rather than that of mining in the\r\nordinary sense, the ore being scooped from the surface of the ground.\r\nOne naturally thinks of a mine as being subterranean; but in the great\r\nopen-pit mines in the Lake Superior region, which are the largest mines\r\nin the world, all the mining is done at the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIt should not be understood, however, that in such mines nature has\r\nleft the red iron ore exposed at the surface in any great quantities.\r\nOn the contrary, it is usually covered by a layer of earth ranging from\r\na yard to ten or more yards in depth, and this, of course, must be\r\nremoved before open-pit methods can be practised. Prospecting for such\r\ndeposits is therefore just as necessary as in cases where the deposit\r\nis situated much deeper in the earth; and the business of prospecting\r\nby \"test pit\" men is as important an industry as ever.\r\n\r\nWhen an available open-pit mine of sufficient extent has been located\r\nthe gigantic task of \"stripping\" or removing the overlying layer of\r\nearth begins. Immense areas of land have been thus stripped in some of\r\nthese undertakings, no difficulties being considered insurmountable.\r\nIf a small river-bed lies in an unfavorable position, the course of\r\nthe river is changed regardless of expense. Farms and farm houses\r\nare purchased and literally carted away, neither land nor houses\r\nrepresenting values worth considering when compared with the stratum\r\nof ore beneath them. The single contract for stripping one area in the\r\nLake Superior region was let for a sum amounting to half a million\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a sufficiently large area has been stripped, railroads are\r\nconstructed into the pit, steam shovels are run into place, and the\r\nactual work of mining begins. Five shovels full make a car-load, and\r\nunder ordinary circumstances the five loads may be delivered in as many\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nThe number of men required to manipulate one of these steam shovels is\r\nfrom ten to twelve. The ore itself is frequently so hard that the scoop\r\nof the shovel could not penetrate it until loosened and broken up, and\r\nit is the business of the gang of workmen to do this and slide the ore\r\ndown within easy working distance of the shovel. This is mostly done\r\nby blasting with dynamite and powder, little of the actual labor being\r\nperformed by hand. In blasting, a deep hole is first drilled into\r\nthe ore near the top of the embankment, and into this hole a stick of\r\ndynamite is dropped and exploded. This enlarges the cavity sufficiently\r\nso that a quantity of blasting powder may be poured in and set off,\r\ntumbling the ore down within reach of the shovel.\r\n\r\nThis ore is frequently almost as hard as iron itself, many of the\r\npieces thus dislodged being too large for convenient handling, either\r\nby the steam shovel or in the chutes at the wharves, and must be still\r\nfurther broken up. This is sometimes done by the men with picks; but\r\nin mining on a large scale, where the deposit is all of a very hard\r\nnature, crushing machines are used.\r\n\r\nIn this manner the steam shovel is kept constantly supplied with ore\r\nfor the waiting train of cars. These trains are arranged on a track\r\nrunning parallel with the track from which the steam shovel operates,\r\nand at such a distance that the centre of the car will be directly\r\nunder the opening in the bottom of the shovel when it is swung around\r\non its crane. The engineer in charge of the locomotive drawing the\r\ntrain stops it in a position so that the first shovelful of ore will\r\nbe dumped into the forward end of the first car. As each successive\r\nshovelful is deposited, representing about one-fifth of a car-load,\r\nthe train is pulled or backed along the track about one-fifth of a\r\ncar-length. In this manner it is only necessary for the steam shovel to\r\nbe swung into the same position and dumped at the same point each time\r\nto insure the proper loading of the cars.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it will be seen that in this open-pit mining\r\nthe steam engine and steam locomotive still play a conspicuous part;\r\nbut in the other forms of iron mining, electric or compressed-air\r\nmotors are used, as much better adapted for underground work. In\r\nthe Lake Superior region, where everything is done by the most\r\nmodern methods, the use of horses and mules for hauling purposes is\r\npractically unknown.\r\n\r\nThe cars used for hauling the ore are of peculiar construction. The\r\nlatest types are built of steel with a carrying capacity of fifty tons\r\nof ore, and are so made that by simply knocking loose a few pins their\r\nbottoms open and discharge the ore into the receiving bins on the\r\nwharves, or into the chutes leading to the waiting boats.\r\n\r\nA perennial problem in iron mining, whether surface or subterranean,\r\njust as in all other kinds of mining, is the removal of accumulations\r\nof water, some of these mines filling at the rate of from twenty-five\r\nto thirty thousand gallons an hour. But an equally important problem\r\nis that of removing moisture from the ore itself. Obviously every\r\nadditional pound of moisture adds to the cost and difficulty in\r\nhandling, and inasmuch as this ore must be transported a distance of\r\nsomething like a thousand miles, necessitating three or four handlings\r\nin the process, the aggregate amount of wasted energy caused by each\r\nton of water is enormous. It has been found that at least ten per\r\ncent of the moisture may be dried out of the ore before shipping, and\r\nthat the ore does not tend to absorb moisture again under ordinary\r\ncircumstances once it has been dried. This is of course of great\r\nadvantage where it is found necessary to store it in heaps some little\r\ntime before shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MINE TO FURNACE\r\n\r\nIn most industries, particularly where the percentage of waste products\r\nis large, it is found advantageous and economical to establish\r\nfactories as near the source of supply of raw material as possible. But\r\nthe iron ore mined in the Lake Superior region is transported something\r\nlike a thousand miles before being delivered to the factories. The\r\nquestion naturally arises, Why is not the ore turned into pig iron or\r\nsteel ingots at once as near the mouths of the mines as possible, and\r\nsent in this condensed form to the factories, thus saving more than\r\nhalf the cost of transportation? The answer is simple: the coal mines\r\nand steel factories lie in the East, one established by nature, the\r\nother by man many years before iron ore was found in the Lake region.\r\nAnd it is found just as cheap and easy to transport the iron to the\r\ncoal regions as it would be to transport the coal to the ore regions.\r\nFurthermore, the factories in the neighborhood of Pittsburg and along\r\nthe southern shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario are near the great\r\ncentres of civilization, and are accessible the year round; while the\r\nLake Superior region is \"frozen in\" for at least three months in the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in place of a great traffic of coal westward to the Lake\r\nSuperior regions, there is a great eastward traffic of ore, by rail and\r\nwater, passing from the mines to furnaces and factories a thousand\r\nmiles away. Indeed, this is probably the greatest and most remarkable\r\nsystem of transportation in the world. Specially constructed trains,\r\nwharves, boats, and machinery, used for this single purpose, and not\r\nduplicated either in design or extent, make this stupendous enterprise\r\na unique, as well as a purely American one.\r\n\r\nThe transportation begins with the train loads of ore that run from\r\nthe mines to the lake shore and out upon the wharves built to receive\r\nthem. These wharves are enormous structures, sometimes half a mile in\r\nlength, built up to about the height of the masts of ore boats. On the\r\nsides and in the centres of these towering structures are huge bins for\r\nholding the ore, these bins communicating directly with the holds of\r\nthe ore steamers tied up alongside. Four tracks are frequently laid on\r\nthe top of the wharves, and are so arranged that trains four abreast\r\ncan dump the ore into the bins, or waiting ships, at the same time.\r\nIf the bins are empty and boats waiting to receive a cargo, the ore\r\nis discharged by long chutes into the holds from the cars. Otherwise\r\nthe bins are filled, the trains returning to the mines as quickly as\r\npossible for fresh loads.\r\n\r\nThe boats for receiving this cargo are of special design, many of\r\nthem differing very greatly in appearance from ordinary ocean liners\r\nof corresponding size. This is particularly true of the \"whale-backs\"\r\nwhich have little in common in appearance with ordinary steamers except\r\nin the matter of funnels; and even these are misplaced sternwards to\r\na distance quite out of drawing with the length of the hull. Their\r\nshape is that of the ordinary type of submarine boat--that is,\r\ncigar-shaped--this effect being obtained by a curved deck completely\r\ncovering the place ordinarily occupied by a flat deck. A wheel-house,\r\nlike a battle-ship's conning-tower, is placed well forward, supported\r\non steel beams some distance above the curved deck for observation\r\npurposes; and engines, boilers, and coal bunkers occupy a small space\r\nin the stern. The boat, therefore, is mostly hold.\r\n\r\nBut the \"whale-backs\" form only a small portion of the ore-fleet. The\r\nordinary type of boat conforms more nearly to the shape of ocean boats,\r\nexcept that the bridge, wheel-house, and engines are located as in the\r\nwhale-backs. The bows of these boats are blunt, the desideratum in\r\nsuch craft being hull-capacity rather than speed. For sea-worthiness\r\nthey are equal to any ocean boats, as the battering waves of Lake\r\nSuperior are quite as powerful and even more treacherous than those\r\nof the Atlantic or Pacific. Some of these boats are five hundred feet\r\nlong, equal to all but the largest ocean vessels. Their coal-carrying\r\ncapacity is relatively small, since coaling stations are numerous at\r\nvarious points on the journey, and every available inch of space is\r\nutilized for the precious iron ore.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate loading, the decks are literally honey-combed\r\nwith hatches, some boats having fifteen or sixteen openings extending\r\nthe width of the deck. By this arrangement the time of loading is\r\nreduced to a matter of a few hours, as a dozen chutes, each discharging\r\nseveral tons of ore per minute, soon fill the yawning compartments\r\nwith the necessary six, eight, or nine thousand tons, that make up the\r\ncargo.\r\n\r\nQuite recently lake-navigators have learned, what rivermen have long\r\nknown, that cheap transportation may be effected on a large scale by\r\nbarges and towing. Before the outbreak of the Civil War forty years\r\nago, the Mississippi river swarmed with great cargo-carrying steamers,\r\nemploying armies of men and consuming enormous quantities of fuel.\r\nBut after the war the experiment was tried of hauling the cargoes on\r\nbarges towed by tug boats, and this proved to be so much cheaper that\r\nthe fleet of great river boats soon disappeared. In somewhat the same\r\nway the barge has come into use of late years in the ore-traffic, and\r\nthe great ore-steamers now tow behind them one or two barges equal in\r\ncarrying capacity to themselves. In this way three ships' cargoes of\r\nore are transported a thousand miles by a score of men, a dozen on the\r\nsteamer and three or four on each of the barges. The barges themselves\r\nare rigged as ships, and if necessary can shift for themselves by means\r\nof sails attached to their stubby masts. But these are used only on\r\nspecial and unusual occasions, as in case of accidental parting of the\r\nhawsers during a storm.\r\n\r\nThe problem of loading the ships at the ore wharves is a simple one as\r\ncompared with the equally important one of transferring the ore from\r\nthe hold to trains of cars in waiting at the eastern end of the water\r\nroute. For four handlings of the ore are necessary before it is finally\r\ndeposited in the furnaces in the east. The first of these is from the\r\nmine to cars; the second from the cars to the boats; the third from the\r\nboats to cars; and the fourth from the cars to the blast furnaces.\r\n\r\nFor many years about the only hand work done in any of these processes\r\nwas that of transferring from the boats to the ore-trains, and even\r\nhere \"automatic unloaders\" are now rapidly supplanting the tedious hand\r\nmethod. By the older methods a travelling crane, or swinging derrick,\r\ndropped a bucket into the hold of the ore-vessel, where workmen\r\nshovelled it full of the red ore. It was then lifted out by machinery\r\nand the contents dumped into cars in much the same manner as that of\r\nthe steam shovel in the mines. Recently, however, a machine has been\r\nperfected which scoops up the ore from the ship's hold and transfers\r\nit to the cars without the aid of shovellers. The only human aid given\r\nthis gigantic machine is to guide it by means of controlling levers--to\r\nfurnish brains for it, in short--the \"muscle\" being furnished by steam\r\npower. The great arm of this automatic unloader, resembling the sweep\r\nof the old-fashioned well in principle, moves up and down, burying\r\nthe jaws of the shovel into the ore in the hold, and pulling them out\r\nagain filled with ore, with monotonous regularity, quickly emptying the\r\nvessel under the guidance of half a dozen men, and performing the labor\r\nof hundreds.\r\n\r\nThus the last field of activity for the laborer and his shovel, in the\r\niron-ore industry, has been usurped by mechanical devices. From the\r\ntime the ore is taken from the mine until it appears as molten metal\r\nfrom the furnaces, it is not touched except by mechanisms driven by\r\nsteam, compressed air, or electricity. And yet, so rapid is the growth\r\nof the iron and steel industry that there is almost always a demand for\r\nmore workmen.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, and perhaps because of the \"American spirit\" among\r\nworkmen, innovations in the way of labor-saving machinery are not\r\nresisted among the mine laborers. The American workman seldom resists\r\nor attacks machinery on the ground that it \"throws him out of a job,\"\r\nas does his English cousin. It would be unjust to attribute this\r\nattitude to superior acumen on the part of the American workman, and it\r\nis probably a difference in conditions and surroundings that accounts\r\nfor the diametrically opposite views held by laborers on the two sides\r\nof the Atlantic. But after all, results must speak for themselves, and\r\nthe advantage all lies in favor of the progressive attitude of the\r\nwestern laborer, if we may judge by the relative social status and\r\nfinancial standing of European and American workmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CONVERSION OF IRON ORE INTO IRON AND STEEL\r\n\r\nSince steel is a compound substance composed essentially of two\r\nelementary substances in varying proportions, it appears that the\r\nname \"steel,\" like wood, refers to a class of which there are several\r\nvarieties. This, of course, is the case, but for the moment we may\r\nconsider steel as a single substance composed chiefly of iron and\r\ncontaining a certain percentage of carbon. In this respect it\r\nresembles cast iron, steel having a smaller amount of carbon. Wrought\r\niron, on the other hand, contains no carbon at all, or at least only a\r\ntrace of it. But whatever the ultimate destiny of iron ore--whether it\r\nis to become aristocratic manganese steel, or plebeian cast iron--it\r\nmust first pass through certain processes before being \"converted.\"\r\n\r\nTo extract the pure iron from the iron ore it is necessary to heat\r\nthe ore in a furnace containing a certain quantity of coal, coke, or\r\ncharcoal, and limestone. The furnaces used in this process are known\r\nas blast-furnaces, and in these about one ton of iron is extracted for\r\nevery two tons of Lake Superior ore, one and a quarter tons of coke,\r\nand half a ton of limestone used. These quantities are by no means\r\nconstant, of course, but they may be taken as representing roughly the\r\nrelative amounts of material that must be fed into the furnaces.\r\n\r\nLike everything else in the world of iron and steel, these\r\nblast-furnaces have undergone revolutionary improvements during the\r\npast quarter of a century. From being most dangerous and destructive\r\nstructures causing frightful loss of life and producing only about one\r\nton of iron a day for every man working about them, as formerly, they\r\nhave now become relatively harmless monsters, capable of turning out\r\nsix times that quantity of ore for each man employed.\r\n\r\nThe older blast-furnace was a huge, chimney-like structure, perhaps a\r\nhundred feet high, into which the ore, coal, and limestone were poured.\r\nMost of the work about these furnaces was done by manual labor, or\r\nat least manual labor was an active assistant to the machinery used\r\nin manipulating the furnaces. The top of the furnace was closed in by\r\na great movable lid, or \"bell,\" and the material for charging it was\r\nhauled up the sides by elevators and dumped in at the top. About the\r\ntop of the furnace was constructed a staging upon which the workmen\r\nstood, an elevator shaft connecting the staging with the ground. The\r\nore and other materials were brought to the foot of the shaft on cars\r\nfrom which it was shovelled into peculiarly designed wheelbarrows,\r\ntrundled to the elevator, and hauled to the top.\r\n\r\nIn order to dump the wheelbarrow loads into the furnaces it was\r\nnecessary to raise the bell. This was always dangerous, and frequently\r\nresulted in the suffocation or injury of the workmen on the staging.\r\nFor when the bell was raised there was an escape of poisonous gases,\r\nwhich might flare out in a sheet of flame, with the possibility of\r\nburning or suffocating the workmen. The fumes from these gases, if\r\ninhaled in small quantities, might simply cause coughing, hiccoughing,\r\nor dizziness; but when inhaled in large quantities they struck down\r\na man like the fumes of chloroform, suffocating him in a few seconds\r\nif he was not removed at once into a purer atmosphere. Indeed, the\r\nlikelihood of this was so great that at many of these furnaces a\r\nspecial workman was detailed to take the position on the staging, well\r\nout of range of the gas, his sole duty being to rescue any of the men\r\nwho might be overcome, and hurry them as quickly as possible down the\r\nelevator shaft into the pure atmosphere below. It was not an uncommon\r\nthing in the neighborhood of these older furnaces to see stretched\r\nabout on the ground at the base several workmen in various stages of\r\nsuffocation. Fortunately, by use of precautionary measures, fatal\r\naccidents were rather unusual, the men being overcome only temporarily,\r\nand usually recovering quickly and returning to work.\r\n\r\nBut the poisonous gas coming from the top of the furnace was not the\r\nonly, nor the worst, danger constantly menacing the men on the staging.\r\nTheir greatest dread was the possibility of explosions occurring in the\r\nfurnace, which might hurl the bell into the air and deluge the upper\r\nstructure with molten metal. Against this possibility there was no\r\nsafeguard in the older furnaces, explosions occurring without warning\r\nand frequently with terrible effects. But fortunately these older types\r\nof furnaces are being rapidly replaced by the newer forms in which the\r\ndanger to life, at least from gas and explosions, is minimized. And\r\neven in the older furnaces, improvements in the structure of the bell\r\nand in methods of filling have greatly lessened the dangers.\r\n\r\nIn the modern type of blast-furnace the work at the top formerly\r\nperformed by men on the staging is accomplished entirely by machinery.\r\nThe general appearance of these furnaces is that of huge iron pipes or\r\nkettles mounted on several iron legs. The outer structure, or shaft,\r\nis constructed of plate iron, but this is lined with fire brick of\r\nconsiderable thickness, and may have a water jacket interposed between\r\nthese bricks and the shaft. About this large kettle are smaller\r\nkettles of somewhat similar shape having pipes leading from their tops\r\nto the larger structure. These smaller kettles are the \"stoves\" used in\r\nproducing the hot air for the furnace.\r\n\r\nThe working capacity of some of these furnaces is in the neighborhood\r\nof a thousand tons of iron a day, although the average furnace produces\r\nonly about half that quantity. The powerful machinery used for charging\r\nthese monster caldrons hauls the ore and other charging materials to\r\nthe top and dumps it in car-load lots.\r\n\r\nIn the older methods of manufacturing steel, the contents of the\r\nblast-furnaces were first drawn off into molds and allowed to cool\r\ninto what is known as pig-iron. It was then necessary to re-heat\r\nthis iron and treat it by the various methods for producing the kind\r\nof steel desired. By the newer methods, however, time and money are\r\nsaved by converting the liquid iron from the blast-furnace directly\r\ninto steel without going through the transitional stage of cooling it\r\ninto pigs. Pigs of iron are still made in enormous quantities, to be\r\nsure, but mostly for shipment to distant places or for stores as stock\r\nmaterial. For statistical purposes, however, the entire product of the\r\nblast-furnace, whether liquid or solid, is known as \"pig iron.\"\r\n\r\nThe older method of removing the iron from the blast furnaces was by\r\ntapping at the opening near the bottom, the stream of liquid iron being\r\nallowed to flow into a connected series of sand molds, each mold being\r\nabout three feet long by three or four inches wide. The bottom of\r\nthese molds was flat but as the metal cooled in them the upper surface\r\nbecame round in shape, assuming a fanciful resemblance to a pig's back.\r\nIn this molding a great amount of time was wasted in the slow process\r\nof cooling, and a large expenditure of energy wasted in this handling\r\nand re-handling of the metal.\r\n\r\nIn modern smelting works, however, pigs are no longer cast in sand\r\nmolds, the molten metal from the furnace being discharged directly into\r\niron molds attached to an endless chain. These molds are long, narrow,\r\nand shallow, having the general shape of sand molds. Each mold as it\r\npasses beneath the opening in the furnace remains just long enough to\r\nreceive the requisite amount of metal to fill it, and then moves on to\r\na point where it is either sprayed with water, or cooled by actually\r\npassing through a tank of water, emerging from this bath with the metal\r\nsufficiently solidified so that it may be dropped into a waiting car at\r\nthe turning point of the endless chain. In this manner the charge from\r\nthe blast-furnace may be drawn, cooled, and converted into pigs, loaded\r\ninto cars, and hauled away without extra handlings or loss of time, the\r\nwhole process occupying practically no more time than the initial step\r\nof tapping by the older method.\r\n\r\nWhere the contents of the blast-furnace are to be converted into\r\nsteel at once, the molten metal is run off into movable tanks which\r\ncarry it directly to the steel furnaces. These tanks, holding perhaps\r\ntwenty tons of metal, are made of thick iron lined with fire brick,\r\nand arranged on low, flat cars designed specially for the purpose.\r\nThese tanks are run under the spout of the furnace, filled with molten\r\nmetal, and drawn to the steel works, possibly five miles away. As a\r\nrule, the distance is much less, but as far as the condition of the\r\nmetal is concerned distance seems to make little difference, as even\r\nat the extreme distance there is no apparent cooling of the seething\r\nmass. The intense heat given off by these trains necessitates specially\r\nconstructed cars, tracks, bridges, and crossings.\r\n\r\nThe destination of this train load of iron pots is the \"mixer\"--a great\r\n200-ton kettle in which the products from the various furnaces are\r\nmixed and rendered uniform in quality. On the arrival of the train at\r\nthe mixer, Titanic machinery seizes the twenty-ton pots and dumps their\r\ncontents bodily into the glowing pool in the great crucible. Like the\r\nfilling process, this operation occupies only a few minutes.\r\n\r\nFrom the mixer the metal is poured out into ladles and transferred\r\nimmediately to the \"converter\"--the important development of Sir Henry\r\nBessemer's discovery that has made possible the modern steel industry.\r\nThis converter resembles in shape some of the old mortars used in the\r\nAmerican Civil War--barrel-shaped structures suspended vertically by\r\ntrunnions at the middle and having an opening at the top. Into this\r\nopening at the top the metal from the mixer is poured and when the\r\nconverter has been sufficiently charged a blast of cooled air is blown\r\nin at the bottom through the molten metal. This blast emerges at the\r\ntop as a long roaring flame, of a red color at first but gradually\r\nchanging into white, and then faint blue. These changes in color are\r\nindicative of the changes that are taking place in the metal, and the\r\nappearance of a certain shade of color indicates that the conversion\r\ninto steel is complete, and that it is time for shutting off the blast\r\nof air. Any mistake in this matter--even the variation of thirty\r\nseconds' time--means a loss of thousands of dollars in the quality of\r\nsteel produced. The man whose duty it is to determine this important\r\npoint, therefore, holds an exceptionally delicate and responsible\r\nposition, and receives pay accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn deciding the exact moment when the blast shall be turned off, this\r\nworkman is guided entirely by the sense of sight. Mounted on a platform\r\ncommanding the best possible view of the mouth of the converter and\r\nwearing green glass goggles of special construction, this man watches\r\nthe change of color in the flame until a certain shade is reached--a\r\nshade that to the ordinary untrained observer does not differ in\r\nappearance from that of a moment before--when he gives the signal to\r\nshut off the blast. When this signal is given the contents of the\r\nconverter is no longer common-place cast iron, but steel, ready to be\r\nmolded into rails, boilers, or a thousand and one other useful things.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the converter may now be drawn off as liquid steel into\r\nmolds of any desired shape and size, and when cooled will be ready for\r\nshipment. But in the great steel factories the metal is not ordinarily\r\nallowed to cool completely before being sent to the rolling mills,\r\nbeing drawn off into molds placed along the surface of small, flat\r\ncars. These molds are rectangular, ordinarily four or five feet high by\r\nless than two feet in diameter. The metal is poured into openings in\r\nthe top of each mold, and allowed to cool, solidify, and to contract\r\nenough to permit the outer casings of the molds to be pulled off by\r\nmachinery, leaving the glowing \"ingots\" of steel ready for molding by\r\nmachinery in the mills.\r\n\r\nThe process just described is the one by which \"Bessemer steel\" is\r\nmade. There is another important process in use, the \"open hearth\"\r\nmethod, which differs considerably from this; but before considering\r\nthis process something more should be said of the man whose discoveries\r\nmade possible the modern steel industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR HENRY BESSEMER\r\n\r\nIn the history of the progress of science and invention some one great\r\nname is usually pre-eminently associated with epoch-marking advances,\r\nalthough there may be a cluster of important but minor associates. This\r\nis true in the history of the modern steel industry, and the central\r\nname here is that of Sir Henry Bessemer.\r\n\r\nBessemer was born at Charlton, England, on Jan. 19, 1813. Always\r\nof an inventive turn of mind, his attention was first directed to\r\nimproving the methods then in use for the manufacture of steel, while\r\nexperimenting with the manufacture of guns. After several years of\r\nexperimenting in his little iron works near London, he reached some\r\ndefinite results which he announced to the British Association in 1856.\r\nIn this paper he described a process of converting cast iron into\r\nsteel by removing the excess of carbon in the molten metal by a blast\r\nof air driven through it. This paper, in short, described the general\r\nprinciples still employed in the Bessemer process of manufacturing\r\nsteel. And although the first simple process described by Bessemer has\r\nbeen modified and supplemented in recent years, it was in this paper\r\nthat the process which placed steel upon the market as a comparatively\r\ncheap, and infinitely superior, substitute for ordinary iron, was first\r\ndisclosed.\r\n\r\nThis famous paper before the British Association aroused great interest\r\namong the English ironmasters, and applications for licenses to use\r\nthe new process were made at once by several firms. But the success\r\nattained by these firms was anything but satisfactory, although\r\nBessemer himself was soon able to manufacture an entirely satisfactory\r\nproduct. The disappointed ironmasters, therefore, returned to the\r\nearlier processes, the inventor himself being about the only practical\r\nironmaster who persisted in using it.\r\n\r\nRecognizing the defects in his process, Bessemer set about overcoming\r\nthem, and at the end of two years he had so succeeded in perfecting\r\nhis methods that his product, equal in every respect to that of the\r\nolder process, could be manufactured at a great saving of time and\r\nmoney. But the ironmasters were now skeptical, and refused to be again\r\ninveigled into applying for licenses. Bessemer, therefore, with the\r\naid of friends, erected extensive steel works of his own at Sheffield,\r\nand began manufacturing steel in open competition with the other steel\r\noperators. The price at which he was able to sell his product and\r\nrealize a profit was so much below the actual cost of manufacture by\r\nthe older process, that there was soon consternation in the ranks of\r\nhis rivals. For when it became known that the firm of Henry Bessemer &\r\nCo. was selling steel at a price something like one hundred dollars a\r\nton less than the ordinary market price, there was but one thing left\r\nfor the ironmasters to do--surrender, and apply for licenses to be\r\nallowed to use the new process.\r\n\r\nBy this means, and through the profits of his own establishment,\r\nBessemer eventually amassed a well-earned fortune. Moreover, he was\r\nhonored in due course by a fellowship in the Royal Society, and\r\nknighted by his government.\r\n\r\nOne other name is usually associated with that of Bessemer in the\r\npractical development of the inventor's original idea. That is the\r\nname of Robert Mushet, and the \"Bessemer-Mushet\" process is still in\r\nuse. Mushet's improvement over Bessemer's original process was that\r\nof adding a certain quantity of _spiegeleisen_, or iron containing\r\nmanganese, which, for some reason not well understood, simplifies the\r\nprocess of steel making. Mushet, therefore, must be considered as the\r\ndiscoverer of a useful, though not an absolutely essential, accessory\r\nto the Bessemer process.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN-HEARTH METHOD\r\n\r\nIn the open-hearth method the metal from the blast-furnaces is not\r\nsent to the converter, but is poured into oven-like structures built\r\nof fire brick, and in these heated to a terrific temperature. This\r\nheat has the same effect upon the metal as the blast of air in the\r\nBessemer converter, and this open-hearth process has become very\r\npopular for manufacturing certain kinds of steel. While in the method\r\nof application this process differs greatly from that of Bessemer, it\r\ndiffers largely in the fact that the oxygen necessary to burn off the\r\ncarbonic oxide, silicon, etc., is made to play over the molten mass\r\ninstead of passing through it.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted that the old type of blast-furnace gave off great\r\nquantities of combustible gases which became waste products. Even gases\r\ncontaining something like 20 or 25 per cent. of carbonic acid may be\r\nhighly inflammable, and thus an enormous quantity of valuable fuel\r\nwas constantly wasted. In some furnaces, to be sure, they were put to\r\npractical use for heating the blast, but as the quantities given off\r\nwere greatly in excess of the amount necessary for this purpose, there\r\nwas a constant loss even with such furnaces.\r\n\r\nQuite recently it has been found that the gases can be used directly\r\nin gas engines, developing three or four times as much energy in this\r\nway as if they were used as fuel under ordinary steam boilers. These\r\nengines are now used for operating the rolling-mill machinery, and the\r\nmachinery of shops adjoining the furnaces, which, however, must not be\r\nsituated at any very great distances from the furnaces. This accounts\r\npartly for the grouping together of blast-furnaces, rolling mills,\r\nand machine shops, the economical feature of this arrangement being\r\nso great that segregated establishments find it next to impossible to\r\ncompete in the open market with such \"communities\" under the conditions\r\nprevailing in the steel industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLOY STEELS\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Krupp steel, or nickel, for armor plates, a few\r\nyears ago, called attention in a popular way to the fact that for\r\ncertain purposes pure steel--that is, iron plus a certain quantity of\r\ncarbon--was not as useful as an alloy of steel with some other metal.\r\nAn alloy was a great improvement over ordinary steel or iron plates\r\nused in warfare; but in the more peaceful pursuits, as well as in\r\nwarfare, certain alloyed steels, such as chrome steel, tungsten steel,\r\nand manganese steel play a very important part.\r\n\r\nChrome steel, for example, in the form of projectiles, is the most\r\ndreaded enemy of nickel-steel armor plates, because of the hardness\r\nand elasticity of armor-piercing projectiles made of it. Such a\r\nsteel contains about two per cent. of chromium with about one or\r\ntwo per cent. of carbon, which when suddenly cooled is extremely\r\nhard and tough. This kind of steel and manganese steel are the best\r\nguards against the burglar and safe-blower, as they resist even very\r\nhighly tempered and hardened drills. As this steel is relatively\r\ncheap to manufacture, it is frequently used in the construction of\r\nsafes and burglar-proof gratings. For this purpose, however, it is\r\nsometimes combined in alternate layers with soft wrought iron, the\r\nsteel resisting the point of the drill, while the iron furnishes the\r\nnecessary elasticity to resist the blows of the sledge. The bars used\r\nin modern jails and prisons are often made in a similar manner of\r\nalternate sheaths of iron and chrome steel. Against the time-honored\r\n\"hack-saw,\" the bugbear of prison officials for generations, such\r\nbars an inch and a quarter in diameter offer an almost insurmountable\r\nobstacle; and they are equally effective against a heavy sledge hammer.\r\n\r\nAt least one case is recorded in which the use of these \"composite\"\r\nbars resulted in a disastrous fire in a prison. A small blaze having\r\nstarted in the basement of this prison, attempts to reach it with a\r\nstream of water were defeated by the bars of the steel gratings at the\r\nwindows, which would not admit the nozzle of the hose. A corps of men\r\narmed with hack-saws, crow-bars, and sledges attacked this grating,\r\nwhich, if made of ordinary steel, could have been readily broken. But\r\nagainst these composite bars they produced no appreciable effect.\r\nMeanwhile the fire gained rapidly, threatening the building and its\r\neight hundred inmates, and was only checked after holes had been made\r\nthrough fire-proof floors and ceilings for admitting the nozzle.\r\n\r\nManganese steel is peculiar in becoming ductile by sudden cooling, and\r\nbrittle on cooling slowly--precisely the reverse of ordinary steel. It\r\ncontains about 1.50 per cent. of carbon, and about 12 per cent. of\r\nmanganese. If a small quantity of manganese, that is, 1 or 2 per cent.,\r\nis used the steel is very brittle, and becomes more so as greater\r\nquantities of the manganese are used, up to about 5 per cent. From that\r\npoint, however, it becomes more ductile as the quantity of manganese\r\nis increased, until at about 12 per cent. it reaches an ideal state.\r\nWhen used for safes and money vaults this steel has one great advantage\r\nover chrome steel--it is not affected by heat. By using a blow-pipe\r\nand heating a limited area of steel, the burglar is able to \"draw the\r\ntemper\" of ordinary steel to a sufficient depth so that he can drill\r\na hole to admit a charge of dynamite; but manganese steel retains\r\nits temper under the blow-pipe no matter how long it may be applied.\r\nAgainst attacks of the sledge, however, it is probably inferior to\r\nchrome steel.\r\n\r\nLike manganese steel, tungsten steel retains its temper even when\r\nheated to high temperatures. For this reason it is used frequently in\r\nmaking tools for metal-lathe work where thick slices of iron are to be\r\ncut, as even at red heat such a tool continues to cut off metal chips\r\nas readily as when kept at a lower temperature. This steel contains\r\nfrom 6 to 10 per cent. of tungsten, a metallic element with which we\r\nhave previously made acquaintance in our studies of the incandescent\r\nlamp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nSOME RECENT TRIUMPHS OF APPLIED SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nNot long ago a little company of men met in a lecture hall of Columbia\r\nUniversity to discuss certain questions in applied science. It was\r\na small gathering, and its proceedings were so unspectacular as to\r\nbe esteemed worth only a few lines of newspaper space. The very\r\nname--\"Society of Electro-Chemistry\"--seemed to mark it as having to do\r\nwith things that are caviar to the general. The name seems to smack of\r\nfumes of the laboratory, far removed from the interests of the man in\r\nthe street. Yet Professor Chandler said in his address of welcome to\r\nthe members of the society, that though theirs was the very youngest\r\nof scientific organizations, he could confidently predict for it a\r\nfuture position outranking that of all its sister societies; and his\r\nprediction was based on the belief that electro-chemistry is destined\r\nto revolutionize vast and important departments of modern industry. A\r\nmajority of the heat-using methods of mechanics will owe their future\r\ndevelopment to the new science.\r\n\r\nIn a word, then, despite its repellent name, the society in question\r\nhas to do with affairs that are of the utmost importance to the man in\r\nthe street. Though its members may sometimes deal in occult formulas\r\nand abstruse calculations, yet the final goal of their studies has to\r\ndo not with abstractions but with practicalities,--with the saving\r\nof fuel, the smelting of metals, the manufacture of commodities. But\r\ntheory in the main must precede practice--the child creeps before it\r\nwalks. \"The later developments of industrial chemistry,\" says Sir\r\nWilliam Ramsey, \"owe their success entirely to the growth of chemical\r\ntheory; and it is obvious,\" he adds significantly, \"that that nation\r\nwhich possesses the most competent chemists, theoretical and practical,\r\nis destined to succeed in the competition with other nations for\r\ncommercial supremacy and all its concomitant advantages.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately this interdependence of science and industry is not a\r\nmere matter of prophecy--for the future tense is never quite so\r\nsatisfying as the present. Vastly important changes have already\r\nbeen accomplished; old industries have been revolutionized, and new\r\nindustries created. The commercial world of to-day owes vast debts to\r\nthe new science. Professor Chandler outlined the character of one or\r\ntwo of these in the address just referred to. He cited in some detail,\r\nfor example, the difference between old methods and new in such an\r\nindustry as the manufacture of caustic soda. He painted a vivid word\r\npicture of the distressing conditions under which soda was produced\r\nin the old-time factories. Salt and sulphuric acid were combined to\r\nproduce sulphate of soda, which was mixed with lime and coal and heated\r\nin a reverberatory furnace. Each phase of the process was laborious.\r\nThe workmen operating the furnaces sweltered all day long in an\r\nalmost unbearable atmosphere--stripped to the waist, dripping with\r\nperspiration, sometimes overcome with heat. Their task was one of the\r\nmost trying to which a man could be subjected.\r\n\r\nBut to-day, in such establishments as the soda manufactories at Niagara\r\nFalls, all this is changed. A salt solution circulates continuously in\r\nretorts where it can be acted upon by electricity supplied from dynamos\r\noperated by the waters of the Niagara River. The workmen, comfortably\r\ndressed and moving about in a normal temperature, have really nothing\r\nto do but refill the retorts now and then and remove the finished\r\nproduct. \"It almost seems,\" Professor Chandler added with a smile, \"as\r\nif workmen ought to be glad to pay for the privilege of participating\r\nin so pleasant an occupation. At all events it is, in all seriousness,\r\na pleasure for the visitor who knows nothing of old practices to\r\nwitness this triumph of a modern scientific method.\"\r\n\r\nEven more interesting, said Professor Chandler, are the processes\r\nemployed in the modern method of producing the metal aluminum by the\r\nelectrolytic process. The process is based on the discovery made\r\nby Mr. Charles M. Hall while he was a student working in a college\r\nlaboratory, that the mineral cryolite will absorb alumina to the extent\r\nof twenty-five per cent. of its bulk, as a sponge absorbs water. The\r\nsolution of this compound is then acted on by electricity, and the\r\naluminum is deposited as pure metal. A curiously interesting practical\r\ndetail of the process is based on the fact that pulverized coke remains\r\nperfectly dry and rises to the surface when stirred into a crucible\r\ncontaining the hot alumina solution: moreover, it rises to the surface\r\nand remains there as a shield to protect the workmen against the heat\r\nof the solution. It serves yet another purpose, as the powdered alumina\r\nmay be sifted upon it and left there to dry before being stirred into\r\nthe crucible. A most ingenious yet simple device tells the workman when\r\nany particular crucible is in need of replenishing. A small, ordinary,\r\nincandescent electric-light bulb is placed in circuit between the poles\r\nthat convey the electric current through the alumina solution. So long\r\nas the crucible contains alumina, the bulb does not glow, because\r\ntwenty volts of electricity are required to make it incandescent,\r\nwhereas seven volts pass through the solution. But so soon as the\r\nalumina becomes exhausted, resistance to the current rises in the\r\ncryolite solution and, as it were, dams back the electric current\r\nuntil it overflows into the wire at sufficient pressure to start the\r\nsignal lamp. Then it is necessary merely for a workman to stir into\r\nthe solution the dry alumina resting on the surface, along with the\r\ncoke that supports it. This, of course, reestablishes the electrolytic\r\nprocess; the lamp goes out and the coke, unaffected by its bath, rises\r\nto the surface to support a fresh supply of alumina.\r\n\r\nSuch a process as this, contrasted with the usual methods of smelting\r\nmetals in fiercely heated furnaces, seems altogether wonderful. Here\r\na pure metal is extracted from the clayey earth of which it formed\r\na part, without being melted or subjected to any of the familiar\r\nprocesses of the picturesque, but costly, laborious, and even\r\ndangerous, blast-furnaces. There is no glare and roar of fires; there\r\nare no showers of sparks; there is no gush of fiery streams of molten\r\nmetal. A silent and invisible electric current, generated by the fall\r\nof distant waters, does the work more expeditiously, more efficiently,\r\nand more cheaply than it could be done by any other method as yet\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nFully to appreciate the importance of the method just outlined, we\r\nmust reflect that aluminum is a metal combining in some measure the\r\nproperties of silver, copper, and iron. It rivals copper as a conductor\r\nof electricity; like silver it is white in color and little subject\r\nto tarnishing; like iron it has great hardness and tensile strength.\r\nTrue, it does not fully compete with the more familiar metals in their\r\nrespective fields; but it combines many valuable qualities in fair\r\ndegree; and it has an added property of extreme lightness that is all\r\nits own. Add to this the fact that aluminum is extremely abundant\r\neverywhere in nature--it is a constituent of nearly all soils and is\r\ncomputed to form about the twelfth part of the entire crust of the\r\nearth--whereas the other valuable metals are relatively rare, and it\r\nwill appear that aluminum must be destined to play an important part in\r\nthe mechanics of the future. There is every indication that the iron\r\nbeds will begin to give out at no immeasurably distant day; but the\r\nsupply of aluminum is absolutely inexhaustible. Until now there has\r\nbeen no means known of extracting it cheaply from the clay of which\r\nit forms so important a constituent. But at last electro-chemistry\r\nhas solved the problem; and aluminum is sure to take an important\r\nplace among the industrial metals, even should it fall short of\r\nthe preeminent position as \"the metal of the future\" that was once\r\nprematurely predicted for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nNITROGEN FROM THE AIR\r\n\r\nThere is a curious suggestiveness about this finding of aluminum at our\r\nvery door, so to speak, some scores of centuries after the relatively\r\nrare and inaccessible metals had been known and utilized by man. But\r\nthere is another yet more striking instance of an abundant element\r\nwhich man needed, but knew not how to obtain until the science of our\r\nown day solved the problem of making it available. This is the case of\r\nthe nitrogen of the air. As every one knows, this gas forms more than\r\nthree-fourths of the bulk of the atmosphere. But, unlike the other\r\nchief constituent, oxygen, it is not directly available for the use of\r\nplants and animals. Yet nitrogen is an absolutely essential constituent\r\nof the tissues of every living organism, vegetable and animal. Any\r\nliving thing from which it is withheld must die of starvation, though\r\nevery other constituent of food be supplied without stint; and the fact\r\nthat the starving organism is bathed perpetually in an inexhaustible\r\nsea of atmosphere chiefly composed of nitrogen would not abate by one\r\njot the certainty of its doom.\r\n\r\nTo be made available as food for plants (and thus indirectly as food\r\nfor animals) nitrogen must be combined with some other element, to\r\nform a soluble salt. But unfortunately the atoms of nitrogen are\r\nvery little prone to enter into such combinations; under all ordinary\r\nconditions they prefer a celibate existence. In every thunder-storm,\r\nhowever, a certain quantity of nitrogen is, through the agency\r\nof lightning, made to combine with the hydrogen of dissociated\r\nwater-vapor, to form ammonia; and this ammonia, washed to the earth\r\ndissolved in rain drops, will in due course combine with constituents\r\nof the soil and become available as plant food. Once made captive\r\nin this manner, the nitrogen atom may pass through many changes and\r\nvicissitudes before it is again freed and returned to the atmosphere.\r\nIt may, for example, pass from the tissues of a plant to the tissues\r\nof a herbivorous animal and thence to help make up the substance of a\r\ncarnivorous animal. As animal excreta or as residue of decaying flesh\r\nit may return to the soil, to form the chief constituent of a guano\r\nbed, or of a nitrate bed,--in which latter case it has combined with\r\nlime or sodium to form a rocky stratum of the earth's crust that may\r\nnot be disturbed for untold ages.\r\n\r\nA moment's reflection on the conditions that govern vegetable and\r\nanimal life in a state of nature will make it clear that a soil once\r\nsupplied with soluble nitrates is likely to be replenished almost\r\nperpetually through the decay of vegetation. But it is equally clear\r\nthat when the same soil is tilled by man, the balance of nature is\r\nlikely to be at once disturbed. Every pound of grain or of meat\r\nshipped to a distant market removes a portion of nitrogen; and unless\r\nthe deficit is artificially supplied, the soil becomes presently\r\nimpoverished.\r\n\r\nBut an artificial supply of nitrogen is not easily secured--though\r\nsomething like twenty-five million tons of pure nitrogen are weighing\r\ndown impartially upon every square mile of the earth's surface. In the\r\nmidst of this tantalizing sea of plenty, the farmer has been obliged\r\nto take his choice between seeing his land become yearly more and more\r\nsterile and sending to far-off nitrate beds for material to take the\r\nplace of that removed by his successive crops. The most important of\r\nthe nitrate beds are situated in Chili, and have been in operation\r\nsince the year 1830. The draft upon these beds has increased enormously\r\nin recent years, with the increasing needs of the world's population.\r\nIn the year 1870, for example, only 150,000 tons of nitrate were\r\nshipped from the Chili beds; but in 1890 the annual output had grown\r\nto 800,000 tons; and it now exceeds a million and a half. Conservative\r\nestimates predict that at the present rate of increased output the\r\nentire supply will be exhausted in less than twenty years. And for some\r\nyears back scientists and economists have been asking themselves, What\r\nthen?\r\n\r\nBut now electro-chemistry has found an answer--even while the alarmists\r\nwere predicting dire disaster. Means have been found to extract the\r\nnitrogen from the atmosphere, in a form available as plant food, and at\r\na cost that enables the new synthetic product to compete in the market\r\nwith the Chili nitrate. So all danger of a nitrogen famine is now at\r\nan end,--and applied science has placed to its credit another triumph,\r\nsecond to none, perhaps, among all its conquests. The author of this\r\ntruly remarkable feat is a Swedish scientist, Christian Birkeland\r\nby name, Professor of Physics in the University of Christiania. His\r\nexperiments were begun only about the year 1903, and the practical\r\nmachinery for commercializing the results--in which enterprise\r\nProfessor Birkeland has had the co-operation of a practical engineer,\r\nMr. S. Eyde--is still in a sense in the experimental stage,--albeit\r\na large factory was put in successful operation in 1905 at Notodden,\r\nNorway.\r\n\r\nProfessor Birkeland has thus accomplished what many investigators in\r\nvarious parts of the world have been striving after for years. The\r\nsignificance of his accomplishment consists in the fact that he has\r\ndemonstrated the possibility of making nitrogen combine with oxygen in\r\nlarge quantities and at a relatively low expense. The mere fact of the\r\ncombination, as a laboratory possibility, had been demonstrated in an\r\nelder generation by Cavendish, and more recently by such workers as\r\nSir William Crookes, and Lord Rayleigh in England and Professors W.\r\nMutjmaan and H. Hofer in Germany. Moreover, the experiments of Messrs.\r\nBradley and Lovejoy, conducted on a commercial scale at Niagara Falls,\r\nhad seemed to give promise of a complete solution of the problem;\r\nhad, indeed, produced a nitrogen compound from the air in commercial\r\nquantity, but not, unfortunately, at a cost that made competition\r\nwith the Chili nitrate possible. Equally unsuccessful in solving this\r\nimportant part of the problem had been the experiments, conducted on a\r\nlarge scale, of Professors Kowalski and Moscicki, at Freiburg.\r\n\r\nAll these experimenters had adopted the same agent as the means of, so\r\nto say, forcing the transformation--namely, electricity. The American\r\ninvestigators employed a current of ten thousand volts; the German\r\nworkers carried the current to fifty thousand volts. The flame of the\r\nelectric arc thus produced ignited the nitrogen with which it came in\r\ncontact readily enough; but the difficulty was that it came in contact\r\nwith so little. Despite ingenious arrangements of multiple poles, the\r\nburning-surface of the multiple arc remained so small in proportion to\r\nthe expenditure of energy that the cost of the operation far exceeded\r\nthe commercial value of the product. Such, at least, must be the\r\ninference from the fact that the establishments in question did not\r\nattain commercial success.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of Professor Birkeland's method is based upon the\r\ncurious fact that when the electric arc is made to pass through a\r\nmagnetic field, its line of flame spreads out into a large disk--\"like\r\na flaming sun.\" The sheet of flame thus produced represents no greater\r\nexpenditure of energy than the lightning flash of light that the same\r\ncurrent would produce outside the magnetic field; but it obviously\r\nadds enormously to the arc-light surface that comes in contact with\r\nthe air, and hence in like proportion to the amount of nitrogen that\r\nwill be ignited. In point of fact, this burning of nitrogen takes\r\nplace so rapidly in laboratory experiments as to vitiate the air of\r\nthe room very quickly. In the commercial operation, with powerful\r\nelectro-magnets and a current of five thousand volts, operating, of\r\ncourse, in closed chambers, the ratio between energy expended and\r\nresult achieved is highly satisfactory from a business standpoint,\r\nand will doubtless become still more so as the apparatus is further\r\nperfected.\r\n\r\nTo the casual reader, unaccustomed to chemical methods, there may seem\r\na puzzle in the explanation just outlined. He may be disposed to say,\r\n\"You speak of the nitrogen as being ignited and burned; but if it is\r\nburned and thus consumed, how can it be of service?\" Such a thought\r\nis natural enough to one who thinks of burning as applied to ordinary\r\nfuel, which seems to disappear when it is burned. But, of course, even\r\nthe tyro in chemistry knows that the fuel has not really disappeared\r\nexcept in a very crude visual sense; it has merely changed its form.\r\nIn the main its solid substance has become gaseous, but every atom of\r\nit is still just as real, if not quite so tangible, as before; and the\r\nchemist could, under proper conditions, collect and weigh and measure\r\nthe transformed gases, and even retransform them into solids.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the atmospheric nitrogen, as in the case of ordinary\r\nfuel, a burning \"consists essentially in the union of nitrogen atoms\r\nwith atoms of oxygen.\" The province of the electric current is to\r\nproduce the high temperature at which alone such union will take place.\r\nThe portion of nitrogen that has been thus \"burned\" is still gaseous,\r\nbut is no longer in the state of pure nitrogen; its atoms are united\r\nwith oxygen atoms to form nitrous oxide gas. This gas, mixed with the\r\natmosphere in which it has been generated, may now be passed through a\r\nreservoir of water, and the new gas combines with a portion of water\r\nto form nitric acid, each molecule of which is a compound of one atom\r\nof hydrogen, one atom of nitrogen, and three atoms of oxygen; and\r\nnitric acid, as everyone knows, is a very active substance, as marked\r\nin its eagerness to unite with other substances as pure nitrogen is in\r\nits aloofness.\r\n\r\nIn the commercial nitrogen-plant at Notodden, the transformed nitrogen\r\ncompound is brought into contact with a solution of milk of lime,\r\nwith the resulting formation of nitrate of lime (calcium nitrate),\r\na substance identical in composition--except that it is of greater\r\npurity--with the product of the nitrate beds of Chili. Stored in closed\r\ncans as a milky fluid, the transformed atmosphere is now ready for the\r\nmarket. A certain amount of it will be used in other manufactories for\r\nthe production of various nitrogenous chemicals; but the bulk of it\r\nwill be shipped to agricultural districts to be spread over the soil as\r\nfertilizer, and in due course to be absorbed into the tissues of plants\r\nto form the food of animals and man.\r\n\r\n\r\nANOTHER METHOD OF NITROGEN FIXATION\r\n\r\nJust at the time when the Scandinavian experimenters were solving\r\nthe problem of securing nitrogen from the air, other experimenters\r\nin Italy, operating along totally different lines, reached the same\r\nimportant result. The process employed by these investigators is known\r\nas the Frank and Caro process, and it bids fair to rival the Norwegian\r\nmethod as a commercial enterprise. The process is described as\r\nfollows by an engineering correspondent of the London _Times_ in the\r\nEngineering Supplement of that periodical for January 22, 1908:\r\n\r\n\"This process is based upon the absorption of nitrogen by calcium\r\ncarbide, when this gas, in the pure form, is passed over the carbide\r\nheated to a temperature of 1,100 degrees centigrade in retorts of\r\nspecial form and design. The calcium carbide required as raw material\r\nfor the cyanamide manufacture is produced in the usual manner by\r\nheating lime and coke to a temperature of 2,500 degrees centigrade in\r\nelectric furnaces of the resistance type.\r\n\r\n\"The European patent rights of the Frank and Caro process have\r\nbeen purchased by the Societa Generale per la Cianamide of Rome,\r\nand the various subsidiary companies promoting the manufacture in\r\nItaly, France, Switzerland, Norway, and elsewhere, are working under\r\narrangement with the parent company as regards sharing of profits.\r\n\r\n\"The first large installation of a plant for carrying out this process\r\nwas erected at Piano d'Orta, in Central Italy, and was put into\r\noperation in December, 1905. The power for this factory is developed\r\nby an independent company, and is obtained by taking water from the\r\nriver Pescara and leading it to a point above the generating station\r\nat Tramonti. A head of 90 feet, equivalent to 8,400 horse-power, is\r\nhere made available for the industries of the district. The power of\r\nthe cyanamide factory is transmitted a distance of 6-1/4 miles at 6,000\r\nvolts. An aluminum and chemical works are also dependent upon the same\r\npower station.\r\n\r\n\"The Piano d'Orta works contains six furnaces for the manufacture of\r\ncyanamide, each furnace containing five retorts for absorption of the\r\nnitrogen by the carbide. A retort is capable of working off three\r\ncharges of 100 kilograms (220 pounds) of carbide per day of 24 hours,\r\nthe weight of the charge increasing to 125 kilograms by the nitrogen\r\nabsorbed. The present carbide consumption of the Piano d'Orta factory\r\nis, therefore, at the rate of about 3,000 tons per annum, and the\r\noutput of calcium cyanamide is about 3,750 tons per annum. The company\r\ncontrolling the manufacture at Piano d'Orta is named the _Societa\r\nItaliana per la Fabbricazione di Prodotti Azotati_. Extensions of\r\nthe factory at this place to a capacity of 10,000 tons per annum are\r\nalready in progress. Another company is also planning the erection\r\nof similar works at Fiume and at Sebenico, on the eastern borders\r\nof the Adriatic Sea. The additional electric power required will be\r\nobtained by carrying out the second portion of the power development\r\nscheme on the river Pescara. A fall of 235 feet, equivalent to 22,000\r\nhorse-power, is available at the new power station, which is being\r\nerected at Piano d'Orta.\"\r\n\r\nAfter stating that companies to operate the Frank and Caro process have\r\nbeen organized in France, in Switzerland, in Germany, in England, and\r\nin America,--the last-named plant being at Muscle Shoals, Tennessee\r\nRiver, in Northern Alabama--the writer continues:\r\n\r\n\"These facts prove that the manufacture of the new nitrogenous manure\r\nwill soon be carried on in all the more important countries on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic. If the financial results come up to the\r\npromoter's expectations the industry in five years' time will have\r\nbecome one of considerable magnitude.\r\n\r\n\"A modification of the original process of some importance has been\r\nsuggested by Polzeniusz. This chemist has found that the addition of\r\nfluorspar (CaF2) to the carbide reduces the temperature required\r\nfor the absorption process by 400 degrees centigrade, while it also\r\nproduces a less deliquescent finished material.\r\n\r\n\"As regards cost of manufacture, no very reliable figures are yet\r\navailable, but the companies promoting the new manufacture are\r\nregulating their sale prices by those of the two rival artificial\r\nmanures--ammonium sulphate and nitrate of soda. Calcium cyanamide is\r\nnow being sold in Germany at 1s. to 1s. 6d. (25 to 37 cents) per unit\r\nof combined nitrogen cheaper than ammonium sulphate, and 3s. to 3s. 6d.\r\n(75 to 87 cents) per unit cheaper than nitrate of soda. Whether the\r\nmanufacture will prove remunerative at this price of about £10 10s.\r\n($102.50) per ton remains to be seen. It is evident that, as the raw\r\nmaterial of the cyanamide manufacture (calcium carbide) costs at least\r\n£8 ($40) per ton to produce under the most favorable conditions, the\r\nmargin of profit will not be large, and that very efficient management\r\nwill be required to earn fair dividends on the capital sunk in the new\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\"It must be noted, however, that the processes are new and are\r\ndoubtless capable of improvement as experience is gained in working\r\nthem; while, on the other hand, the competition of the two rival\r\nartificial manures is likely to diminish as the years pass on.\r\n\r\n\"The new industry is, therefore, likely to be a permanent addition to\r\nthe list of electro-metallurgical processes. But for the present its\r\nsuccess can only be expected in centres of very cheap water-power, as,\r\nfor instance, in those localities where the electric horse-power year\r\ncan be generated and transmitted to the cyanamide works at an inclusive\r\ncost of £2 ($10) or under.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICAL ENERGY AND HIGH TEMPERATURES\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the active instrumentality by which the\r\nindustrial feats thus far outlined have been accomplished, is that\r\nweird conveyer of energy known as electricity. In the case of the\r\naluminum manufacture, electricity operated according to the strange\r\nprocess of electrolysis, in virtue of which certain atoms of matter\r\nmove to one pole of a battery while other atoms move to the opposite\r\npole, thus effecting a separation--the result being, in the case in\r\nquestion, the deposit of pure aluminum at the negative pole. In the\r\ncase of the nitrogen factories, however, the manner of operation of\r\nthe electric current is quite different. Electricity, as such, is not\r\nreally concerned in the matter; the efficiency of the current depends\r\nsolely upon the production of heat. For example, any other agency\r\nthat brought the atmosphere to a corresponding temperature would be\r\nequally efficacious in igniting the nitrogen. But in actual practice,\r\nfor this particular purpose, no other known means of producing high\r\ntemperatures could at all compete with the electric arc.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other operations involving the employment of high\r\ntemperatures in which electricity is equally preeminent. It is feasible\r\nwith the electric arc to attain a temperature of about 3,600 degrees\r\ncentigrade--and even this might be exceeded were it not that carbon,\r\nof which the electrodes are composed, volatilizes at that temperature.\r\nMeantime, the highest attainable temperature with ordinary fuels in\r\nthe blast furnace is only about 1,800 degrees; and the oxy-hydrogen\r\nflame is only about two hundred degrees higher. A mixture of oxygen and\r\nacetylene, however, burns at a temperature almost equaling that of the\r\nelectric arc; and this flame, manipulated with the aid of a blowpipe,\r\noffers a useful means of applying a high temperature locally, for such\r\nprocesses as the welding of metals. The very highest temperatures yet\r\nreached in laboratory or workshop, however, are due to the use of\r\nexplosive mixtures. Thus a mixture of the metal aluminum granulated,\r\nand oxide of iron, when ignited by a fulminating powder, readjusts its\r\natoms to form oxide of aluminum and pure iron, and does this with such\r\nfervor that a temperature of about three thousand degrees is reached,\r\nthe resulting iron being not merely melted but brought almost to the\r\nboiling point. Practical advantage is taken of this reaction for the\r\nrepair of broken implements of iron or steel, the making of continuous\r\nrails for trolleys, and the like.\r\n\r\nThis reaction of aluminum and iron does not, to be sure, give a higher\r\ntemperature than the electric arc; but this culminating feat has been\r\nachieved, in laboratory experiments, through the explosion of cordite\r\nin closed steel chambers; the experimenters being the Englishmen Sir\r\nAndrew Noble and Sir F. Abel. It is difficult to estimate accurately\r\nthe degree of heat and pressure attained in these experiments; but it\r\nis believed that the temperature approximated 5,000 degrees centigrade,\r\nwhile the pressure represented the almost inconceivable push of ninety\r\ntons to the square inch.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to explain that cordite is a form of smokeless\r\npowder composed of gun cotton, nitroglycerine, and mineral jelly. No\r\ndoubt the extreme heat produced by its explosion is associated with\r\nthe suddenness of the reaction; corresponding to the efficiency as a\r\npropellant that has led to the adoption of this powder for use in the\r\nsmall arms of the British Army. No commercial use has yet been made\r\nof cordite as a mere producer of heat; but there is an interesting\r\nsuggestion of possible future uses in the fact that crystals of diamond\r\nhave been found in the residue of the explosion chamber--microscopic\r\nin size, to be sure, but veritable diamonds in miniature. Sir\r\nWilliam Crookes has suggested that, could the reaction be prolonged\r\nsufficiently, \"there is little doubt that the artificial formation of\r\ndiamonds would soon pass from the microscopic stage to a scale more\r\nlikely to satisfy the requirements of science, if not those of personal\r\nadornment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS OF TO-DAY AND TO-MORROW\r\n\r\nIn attempting to suggest the importance of science in its relation\r\nto modern industries, I have thought it better to cite three or\r\nfour illustrative cases in some detail rather than to attempt a\r\ncomprehensive summary of the almost numberless lines of commercial\r\nactivity that have a similar origin and dependence.\r\n\r\nTo attempt a full list of these would be virtually to give a catalogue\r\nof mechanical industries. It may be well, however, to point out a few\r\nfamiliar instances, in order to emphasize the economic importance of\r\nthe subject; and to suggest a few of the lines along which present-day\r\ninvestigators are seeking further conquests.\r\n\r\nVery briefly, then, consider how the application of scientific\r\nknowledge has changed the aspect of the productive industries. Thanks\r\nto science, farming is no longer a haphazard trade. The up-to-date\r\nfarmer knows the chemical constitution of the soil; understands what\r\nconstituents are needed by particular crops and what fertilizing\r\nmethods to employ to keep his land from deteriorating. He knows how\r\nto select good seed according to the teaching of heredity; how to\r\ncombat fungoid and insect pests by chemical means; how to meet the\r\nencroachments of the army of weeds. In the orchard, he can tell by the\r\nappearance of leaf and bark whether the soil needs more of nitrogen,\r\nof potash, or of humus; he uses sprays as a surgeon uses antiseptics;\r\nhe introduces friendly insects to prey on insect pests; he irrigates\r\nor surface-tills or grows cover crops in accordance with a good\r\nunderstanding of the laws of capillarity as applied to water in the\r\nearth's crust. In barnyard and dairy he applies a knowledge of the\r\nchemistry of foods in his treatment of flock and herd; he ventilates\r\nhis stables that the stock may have an adequate supply of oxygen; he\r\nmilks his cows with a mechanical apparatus, extracts the cream with a\r\ncentrifugal \"separator,\" and churns by steam or by electric power.\r\n\r\nIn the affairs of manufacturer and transporter of commodities, methods\r\nare no less revolutionary. Steam power and electric dynamo everywhere\r\nhold sway; trolley and electric light and telephone have found their\r\nway to the most distant hamlet; electricians and experimental chemists\r\nare searching for new methods in the factories; artificial stone is\r\ncompeting with the product of the quarries; artificial dyes have\r\nsounded the doom of the madder and indigo industries.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it requires no great gift of prophecy to see that what has been\r\naccomplished is only an earnest of what is to come in the not distant\r\nfuture. In every direction eager experimenters are on the track of new\r\ndiscoveries. Any day a chance observation may open new and important\r\nfields of exploration, just as Hall's observation about the power\r\nof cryolite to absorb aluminum pointed the way to the new aluminum\r\nindustry; and as Birkeland's chance observation of the electric arc in\r\na magnetic field unlocked the secret of the unresponsive nitrogen. It\r\nwill probably not be long, for example, before a way will be found to\r\nproduce electric light without heat--in imitation of the wonderful lamp\r\nof the glow-worm.\r\n\r\nThen in due course we must learn to use fuel without the appalling\r\nwaste that at present seems unavoidable. A modern steam-engine makes\r\navailable only five to ten per cent. of the energy that the burning\r\nfuel gives out as heat--the rest is dissipated without serving man the\r\nslightest useful purpose. Moreover, the new studies in radio-activity\r\nhave taught us that every molecule of matter locks up among its\r\nwhirling atoms and corpuscles a store of energy compared with which\r\nthe energy of heat is but a bagatelle. It is estimated that a little\r\npea-sized fragment of radium has energy enough in store--could we\r\nbut learn to use it--to drive the largest steamship across the\r\nocean--taking the place of hundreds of tons of coal as now employed.\r\nThe mechanics of the future must learn how to unlock this treasury of\r\nthe molecule; how to get at these atomic and corpuscular forces, the\r\nvery existence of which was unknown to science until yesterday. The\r\ngeneration that has learned that secret will look back upon the fuel\r\nproblems of our day somewhat as we regard the flint and steel and the\r\nopen fire of the barbarian.\r\n\r\nIf problems of energy offer such alluring possibilities as this,\r\nproblems of matter are even more inspiring. The new synthetic chemistry\r\nsets no bounds to its ambitions. It has succeeded in manufacturing\r\nmadder, indigo, and a multitude of minor compounds. It hopes some day\r\nto manufacture rubber, starch, sugar--even albumen itself, the very\r\nbasis of life. Rubber is a relatively simple compound of hydrogen and\r\ncarbon; starch and sugar are composed of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen;\r\nalbumen has the same constituents, plus nitrogen. The raw materials\r\nfor building up these substances lie everywhere about us in abundance.\r\nA lump of coal, a glass of water, and a whiff of atmosphere contain\r\nall the nutritive elements, could we properly mix them, of a loaf of\r\nbread or a beefsteak. And science will never rest content until it has\r\nlearned how to make the combination. It is a long road to travel, even\r\nfrom the relatively advanced standpoint of to-day; but sooner or later\r\nscience will surely travel it.\r\n\r\nAnd then--who can imagine, who dare predict, the social and economic\r\nrevolution that must follow? Our social and business life to-day\r\ndiffers more widely from that of our grandfathers than theirs differed\r\nfrom the life of the Egyptian and Babylonian of three thousand years\r\nago; but this gap is as ditch to cañon compared with the gap that\r\nseparates us from the life of that generation of our descendants which\r\nshall have learned the secret of making food-stuffs from inorganic\r\nmatter in the laboratory and factory. It is a long road to travel, I\r\nrepeat; but modern science travels swiftly and with many short-cuts,\r\nand it may reach this goal more quickly than any conservative dreamer\r\nof to-day would dare to predict.\r\n\r\nAll speed to the ambitious voyager!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nREFERENCE LIST AND NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nMAN AND NATURE\r\n\r\nFor a general discussion of primitive conditions of labor and\r\nprehistoric man's civilization, it will be of interest in connection\r\nwith this chapter to consult volume I., chapter I., which deals with\r\nprehistoric science.
