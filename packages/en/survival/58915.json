Those who were\r\nfortunate enough to be with the science teams during those weeks will\r\nlong remember the experience; it was like being in the crow’s nest of a\r\nship during landfall and passage through an archipelago of strange\r\nislands. We had known that Jupiter would be remarkable, for man had been\r\nstudying it for centuries, but we were far from prepared for the torrent\r\nof new information that the Voyagers poured back to Earth.\r\n\r\nSome of the spirit of excitement and connection is captured in this\r\nvolume. Its senior author was a member of the Imaging Team. It is not\r\ncommon that a person can both “do science” at the leading edge and also\r\npresent so vivid an inside picture of a remarkable moment in the history\r\nof space exploration.\r\n\r\n  April 30, 1980\r\n                                                         Thomas A.

We had, of course, expected a number\r\nof discoveries because we had never before been able to study in detail\r\nthe atmospheric motions on a planet that is a giant spinning sphere of\r\nhydrogen and helium, nor had we ever observed planet-sized objects such\r\nas the Jovian satellites Ganymede and Callisto, which are half\r\nwater-ice. We had never been so close to a Moon-sized satellite such as\r\nIo, which was known to be dispersing sodium throughout its Jovian\r\nneighborhood and was thought to be generating a one-million-ampere\r\nelectrical current that in some way results in billions of watts of\r\nradio emission from Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe closer Voyager came to Jupiter the more apparent it became that the\r\nscientific richness of the Jovian system was going to greatly exceed\r\neven our most optimistic expectations. The growing realization among\r\nVoyager scientists of the wealth of discovery is apparent in their\r\ncomments, discussions, and reports as recounted by the authors in their\r\ndescriptions of the two encounters.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the discoveries occurred in the few weeks around each\r\nencounter, they were, of course, the result of more than those few weeks\r\nof effort. In fact, planning started a decade earlier, and the Voyager\r\nteam of engineers and scientists had been designing, building, and\r\nplanning for the encounters for seven years. The Pioneer spacecraft made\r\nthe first reconnaissance of Jupiter in 1973-1974, providing key\r\nscientific results on which Voyager could build, and discoveries from\r\ncontinuing ground-based observations suggested specific Voyager studies.\r\nVoyager is itself just the second phase of exploration of the Jovian\r\nsystem. It will be followed by the Galileo program, which will directly\r\nprobe Jupiter’s atmosphere and provide long-term observations of the\r\nJovian system from an orbiting spacecraft. In the meantime, the Voyager\r\nspacecraft will continue their journey to Saturn, and possibly Uranus\r\nand Neptune, planets even more remote from Earth and about which we know\r\neven less than we knew of Jupiter before 1979.\r\n\r\nAs is clearly illustrated in this recounting of the voyage to Jupiter,\r\nscientific endeavors are human endeavors; just as Galileo could not have\r\nforeseen the advancement in our knowledge initiated by his discoveries\r\nof the four Jovian moons in 1610, neither can we fully comprehend the\r\nscientific heritage that our exploration of space is providing future\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\n  April 1980\r\n                                                         Edward C.

Larger than all the other planets and satellites combined,\r\nJupiter is a true giant. If intelligent beings exist on planets circling\r\nnearby stars, it is probable that Jupiter is the only member of our\r\nplanetary system they can detect. They can see the Sun wobble in its\r\nmotion with a twelve-year period as Jupiter circles it, pulling first\r\none way, then the other with the powerful tug of its gravity. If\r\nastronomers on some distant worlds put telescopes in orbit above their\r\natmospheres, they might even be able to detect the sunlight reflected\r\nfrom Jupiter. But all the other planets—including tiny inconspicuous\r\nEarth—would be hopelessly lost in the glare of our star, the Sun.\r\n\r\nJupiter is outstanding among planets not only for its size, but also for\r\nits system of orbiting bodies. With fifteen known satellites, and\r\nprobably several more too small to have been detected, it forms a sort\r\nof miniature solar system. If we could understand how the Jovian system\r\nformed and evolved, we could unlock vital clues to the beginning and\r\nultimate fate of the entire solar system.\r\n\r\nAncient peoples all over the world recognized Jupiter as one of the\r\nbrightest wandering lights in their skies. Only Venus is brighter, but\r\nVenus, always a morning or evening star, never rules over the dark\r\nmidnight skies as Jupiter often does. In Greek and Roman mythology the\r\nplanet was identified with the most powerful of the gods and lord of the\r\nheavens—the Greek Zeus; the Roman Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAs befits the king of the heavens, the planet Jupiter moves at a slow\r\nand stately pace. Twelve years are required for Jupiter to complete one\r\norbit around the Sun. For about six months of each year, Jupiter shines\r\ndown on us from the night sky, more brightly and steadily than any star.\r\nDuring the late 1970s it was a winter object, but in 1980 it will\r\ndominate the spring skies, becoming a summer “star” about 1982.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Early Discoveries\r\n\r\nEven seen through a small telescope or pair of binoculars, Jupiter looks\r\nlike a real world, displaying a faintly banded disk quite unlike the\r\ntiny, brilliant image of a star. It also reveals the brightest members\r\nof its satellite family as starlike points spread out along a straight\r\nline extended east-west through the planet. There are four of these\r\nplanet-sized moons; with their orbits seen edge-on from Earth, they seem\r\nto move constantly back and forth, changing their configuration hourly.\r\n\r\nIn January 1610, in his first attempt to apply the newly invented\r\ntelescope to astronomy, Galileo discovered the four large satellites of\r\nJupiter. He correctly interpreted their motion as being that of objects\r\ncircling Jupiter—establishing the first clear proof of celestial motion\r\naround a center other than the Earth. The discovery of these satellites\r\nplayed an important role in supporting the Copernican revolution that\r\nformed the basis for modern astronomy.\r\n\r\nA few decades later the satellites of Jupiter were used to make the\r\nfirst measurement of the speed of light. Observers following their\r\nmotions had learned that the satellite clock seemed to run slow when\r\nJupiter was far from Earth and to speed up when the two planets were\r\ncloser together. In 1675 the Danish astronomer Ole Roemer explained that\r\nthis change was due to the finite velocity of light: The satellites only\r\nseemed to run slow at large distances because the light coming from them\r\ntook longer to reach Earth. Knowing the dimensions of the orbits of\r\nEarth and Jupiter and the amount of the delay (about fifteen minutes),\r\nRoemer was able to calculate one of the most fundamental constants of\r\nthe physical universe—the speed of light (about 300 000 kilometers per\r\nsecond).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Galileo’s notes summarizing his first observations of\r\n    the Jovian satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto in January\r\n    1610 were made on a piece of scratch paper containing the draft of a\r\n    letter presenting a telescope to the Doge in Venice. These\r\n    observations were the result of Galileo’s first attempt to apply the\r\n    telescope to astronomical research.]\r\n\r\nThe four great moons of Jupiter are called the Galilean satellites after\r\ntheir discoverer. Their individual names—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and\r\nCallisto—were proposed by Simon Marius, a contemporary and rival of\r\nGalileo. (Marius claimed to have discovered the satellites a few weeks\r\nbefore Galileo did, but modern scholars tend to discredit his claim.)\r\nIo, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto are names of lovers of the god\r\nJupiter in Greco-Roman mythology. Since Jupiter was not at all shy about\r\ntaking lovers, there are enough such names for the other eleven Jovian\r\nsatellites, as well as for those yet to be discovered.\r\n\r\nIn the century following Galileo’s death, improvements in telescopes\r\nmade it possible to measure the size of Jupiter and to note that it\r\nbulged at the equator. The equatorial diameter is known today to be 142\r\n800 kilometers, while from pole to pole Jupiter measures only 133 500\r\nkilometers. For comparison, the diameter of the Earth is 12 900\r\nkilometers, only about one-tenth as great, and the flattening of Earth\r\nis also much smaller (less than one percent). By measuring the orbits of\r\nthe satellites and applying the laws of planetary motion discovered by\r\nJohannes Kepler and Isaac Newton, astronomers were also able to\r\ndetermine the total mass of Jupiter—about 2 × 10²⁴ tons, or 318 times\r\nthe mass of the Earth.\r\n\r\nOnce the size and mass are known, it is possible to calculate another\r\nfundamental property of a planet—its density. The density, which is the\r\nmass divided by the volume, provides important clues to the composition\r\nand interior structure of a planetary body. The density of Earth, a body\r\ncomposed primarily of rocky and metallic materials, is 5.6 times the\r\ndensity of water. The mass of Jupiter is 318 times that of Earth; its\r\nvolume is 1317 times that of Earth. Thus Jupiter’s density is\r\nsubstantially lower than Earth’s, amounting to 1.34 times the density of\r\nwater. From this low density, it was evident long ago that Jupiter was\r\nnot just a big brother of Earth and the other rocky planets in the inner\r\nsolar system. Rather, Jupiter is the prototype of the giant, gas-rich\r\nplanets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. These giant planets must,\r\nfrom their low density, have a composition fundamentally different from\r\nthat of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Moon, and Mars.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Jupiter Through the Telescope\r\n\r\nJupiter is a beautiful sight seen with the naked eye on a clear night,\r\nbut only through a telescope does it begin to reveal its magnificence.\r\nThe most prominent features are alternating light and dark bands,\r\nrunning parallel to the equator and subtly shaded in tones of blue,\r\nyellow, brown, and orange. However, these bands are not the planet’s\r\nonly conspicuous markings. In 1664 the English astronomer Robert Hooke\r\nfirst reported seeing a large oval spot on Jupiter, and additional spots\r\nwere noted as telescopes improved. As the planet rotates on its axis,\r\nsuch spots are carried across the disk and can be used to measure\r\nJupiter’s speed of rotation. The giant planet spins so fast that a\r\nJovian day is less than half as long as a day on Earth, averaging just\r\nunder ten hours.\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century, observers using increasingly\r\nsophisticated telescopes were able to see more complex detail in the\r\nband structure, with wisps, streaks, and festoons that varied in\r\nintensity and color from year to year. Furthermore, observations\r\nrevealed the remarkable fact that not all parts of the planet rotate\r\nwith the same period; near the equator the apparent length of a Jovian\r\nday is several minutes shorter than the average day at higher latitudes.\r\nIt is thus apparent that Jupiter’s surface is not solid, and astronomers\r\ncame to realize that they were looking at a turbulent kaleidoscope of\r\nshifting clouds.\r\n\r\nAlthough the face of Jupiter is always changing, some spots and other\r\ncloud features survive for years at a time, much longer than do the\r\nlargest storms on Earth. The record for longevity goes to the Great Red\r\nSpot. This gigantic red oval, larger than the planet Earth, was first\r\nseen more than three centuries ago. From decade to decade it has changed\r\nin size and color, and for nearly fifty years in the late eighteenth\r\ncentury no sightings were reported, but since about 1840 the Great Red\r\nSpot has been the most prominent feature on the disk of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: This ground-based photograph of Jupiter showing the\r\n    Great Red Spot in the southern hemisphere was taken with the\r\n    Catalina Observatory’s 61-inch telescope in December 1966.]\r\n\r\nIt was not until the twentieth century that the composition of the\r\natmosphere of Jupiter could be measured. In 1905 spectra of the planet\r\nrevealed the presence of gases that absorb strongly at red and infrared\r\nwavelengths; thirty years later these were identified as ammonia and\r\nmethane. These two poisonous gases are the simplest chemical compounds\r\nof hydrogen combined with nitrogen and carbon, respectively. In the\r\natmosphere of Earth they are not stable, because oxygen, which is highly\r\nactive chemically, destroys them. The existence of methane and ammonia\r\non Jupiter demonstrated that free oxygen could not be present and that\r\nthe atmosphere was dominated by hydrogen—a reducing, rather than\r\noxidizing, condition. Subsequently, hydrogen was identified\r\nspectroscopically. Although much more abundant than methane or ammonia,\r\nhydrogen is harder to detect.\r\n\r\nIn the 1940s and 1950s the German-American astronomer Rupert Wildt used\r\nall the available data to derive a picture of Jupiter that is still\r\ngenerally accepted. He noted that both the low total density and the\r\nobserved presence of hydrogen-rich compounds in the atmosphere were\r\nconsistent with a bulk composition similar to that of the Sun and stars.\r\nThis “cosmic composition” is dominated by the two simplest elements,\r\nhydrogen and helium, which together make up nearly 99 percent of all the\r\nmaterial in the universe. Wildt hypothesized that the giant planets,\r\nbecause of their large size, had succeeded in retaining this primordial\r\ncomposition, whereas the hydrogen and helium had escaped from the\r\nsmaller inner planets. He also used his knowledge of the properties of\r\nhydrogen and helium to calculate what the interior structure of Jupiter\r\nmight be like, concluding that the planet is mostly liquid or gas. Wildt\r\nsuggested that there probably was a core of solid material deep in the\r\ninterior, but that much of Jupiter is fluid—extremely viscous and\r\ncompressed deep below the visible atmosphere, but still not solid. The\r\natmosphere seen from above is just the thin, topmost layer of an ocean\r\nof gases thousands of kilometers thick.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Recent Earth-Based Studies of Jupiter\r\n\r\nIn the past, a great deal of planetary research was basically\r\ndescriptive, consisting of visual observations and photography.\r\nBeginning in the 1960s, a new generation of planetary scientists began\r\nto apply the techniques of modern astrophysics and geophysics to the\r\nstudy of the solar system. Inspired in part by the developing space\r\nprograms of the United States and the Soviet Union, scientists began to\r\nask more quantitative questions: What are the surfaces and atmospheres\r\nmade of? What are the temperatures and wind speeds? Exactly what\r\nquantities of different elements and isotopes are present? And how can\r\nthese new data be used to infer the origin and evolution of the planets?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The major features of Jupiter are shown in schematic\r\n    form. The planet is a banded disk of turbulent clouds; all its\r\n    stripes are parallel to the bulging equator. Large dusky gray\r\n    regions surround each pole. Darker gray or brown stripes called\r\n    belts intermingle with lighter, yellow-white stripes called zones.\r\n    Many of the belts and zones are permanent features that have been\r\n    named. One feature of particular note is the Great Red Spot, an\r\n    enigmatic oval larger than the planet Earth, which was first seen\r\n    more than three centuries ago. During the years the spot has changed\r\n    in size and color, and it escaped detection entirely for nearly\r\n    fifty years in the 1700s. However, since the mid-nineteenth century\r\n    the Great Red Spot has been the most prominent feature on the face\r\n    of Jupiter.

Undetected but possibly also present were nitrogen,\r\nneon, argon, and water vapor. The abundance of helium was particularly a\r\nproblem; although it was presumably the second-ranking gas after\r\nhydrogen, it has no spectral features in visible light and its presence\r\nremained only a hypothesis, unconfirmed by observation.\r\n\r\nAlthough the presence of a gas can usually be inferred from\r\nspectroscopy, solids or liquids cannot normally be detected in this way.\r\nThus the composition of Jupiter’s clouds could not be determined\r\ndirectly. However, the presence of ammonia gas provided an important\r\nclue. At the temperatures expected in the upper atmosphere of the\r\nplanet, ammonia gas must freeze to form tiny crystals of ammonia ice,\r\njust as water vapor in the Earth’s atmosphere freezes to form cirrus\r\nclouds. Most investigators agreed that the high clouds covering much of\r\nJupiter must be ammonia cirrus. But ammonia crystals are white, so the\r\npresence of this material provides no explanation for the many colors\r\nseen on Jupiter. Additional materials must be present—perhaps colored\r\norganic compounds, produced in small amounts by the action of sunlight\r\non the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nBecause Jupiter is five times farther from the Sun than is the Earth, a\r\ngiven area on Jupiter receives only about four percent as much solar\r\nheating as does a comparable area on Earth. Thus Jupiter is colder than\r\nEarth; even though it may be warm deep below its blanket of clouds,\r\nJupiter presents a frigid face.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: These blue filter photographs of Jupiter were taken\r\n    at Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii. They show changes on Jupiter’s\r\n    surface between 1973 and 1978, with the dates of the observations.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: July 25, 1973]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: October 5, 1974]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: October 2, 1975]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: November 20, 1976.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: January 28, 1978.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: December 19, 1978.]\r\n\r\nThe development of a new science, infrared astronomy, in the 1960s made\r\nit possible to measure these low temperatures directly. In the case of a\r\ncloudy planet like Jupiter, the infrared emission evident at various\r\nwavelengths originates at different depths in the atmosphere. It is a\r\ngeneral property of any mixed, convecting atmosphere that the\r\ntemperature varies with depth; the rate of variation depends only on the\r\ncomposition of the atmosphere, the gravity of the planet, and the\r\npresence or absence of condensible materials to form clouds. On Jupiter\r\nit is about 1.9° C warmer for each kilometer of descent through the\r\natmosphere. Thus, although the ammonia clouds are very cold, a little\r\nabove -173° C, if one goes deep enough one can reach temperatures that\r\nare quite comfortable. With a variation of 1.9° C per kilometer,\r\nterrestrial “room temperature” would be reached about 100 kilometers\r\nbelow the clouds.\r\n\r\nTo measure the total energy radiated by a planet, it is necessary to\r\nutilize infrared radiation at wavelengths more than one hundred times\r\nlonger than the wavelengths of visible light. Even when detectors were\r\ndeveloped that could measure such radiation, it was impossible to\r\nobserve celestial sources such as Jupiter because of the opacity of the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere. Even a tiny amount of water vapor in our own\r\natmosphere can block our view of long-wave infrared. To make the\r\nrequired measurements, it is necessary to carry a telescope to very high\r\naltitudes, above all but a fraction of a percent of the offending water\r\nvapor.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960s a Lear-Jet airplane was equipped with a telescope and\r\nmade available by NASA to astronomers to carry out long-wave infrared\r\nobservations from above 99 percent of the terrestrial water vapor. In\r\n1969 Frank Low of the University of Arizona and his colleagues used this\r\nsystem to make a remarkable discovery: Jupiter was radiating more heat\r\nthan it received from the Sun! Repeated observations demonstrated that\r\nbetween two and three times as much energy emanated from the planet as\r\nwas absorbed. Thus Jupiter must have an internal heat source; in effect,\r\nit shines by its own power as well as by reflected sunlight. Theoretical\r\nstudies suggest that the heat is primordial, the remnant of an\r\nincandescent proto-Jupiter that formed four and one-half billion years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Images of Jupiter in visible light (below) and\r\n    five-micrometer infrared light show the planet’s characteristic\r\n    belts and zones. The infrared image reveals areas that emit large\r\n    amounts of thermal energy. The source of the energy is thought to be\r\n    breaks in the Jovian cloud cover, which allow investigators a\r\n    glimpse of the deep regions of the atmosphere. One of the mysteries\r\n    of Jupiter concerns its heat balance: The planet appears to radiate\r\n    more heat than it receives from the Sun. [P-20957]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Jupiter in visible light.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time that the internal heat source on Jupiter was being\r\nrevealed with long-wave airborne infrared telescopes, a new discovery\r\nwas being made from short-wave infrared observations. The clouds of\r\nJupiter are too cold to emit any detectable thermal radiation at a\r\nwavelength of 5 micrometers (about ten times the wavelength of green\r\nlight). Nevertheless, images of Jupiter at 5 micrometers revealed a few\r\nsmall spots where large amounts of thermal energy were being emitted.\r\nThe sources of the energy appeared to be holes or breaks in the clouds,\r\nwhere it was possible to see deeper into hotter regions. The discovery\r\nof these hot spots opened the possibility of probing deep regions of the\r\nJovian atmosphere that had previously been beyond the reach of direct\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Jovian Magnetosphere\r\n\r\nThe discovery of planetary magnetospheres began in 1959 when the first\r\nU.S. Explorer satellite detected the radiation belts around the Earth.\r\nNamed for James Van Allen of the University of Iowa, whose\r\ngeiger-counter instrument aboard Explorer 1 first measured them, these\r\nbelts are regions in which charged atomic particles—primarily electrons\r\nand protons—are trapped by the magnetic field of the Earth. They are one\r\nmanifestation of the terrestrial magnetosphere—a large, dynamic region\r\naround the Earth in which the magnetic field of our planet interacts\r\nwith streams of charged particles emanating from the Sun.\r\n\r\nAt almost the same time that the terrestrial magnetosphere was being\r\ndiscovered by artificial satellites, astronomers were finding evidence\r\nto suggest similar phenomena around Jupiter. Radio astronomy is a branch\r\nof science that measures radiation from celestial bodies at radio\r\nfrequencies, which correspond to wavelengths much longer than those of\r\nvisible or infrared light. All planets emit weak thermal radio\r\nradiation, but in the late 1950s investigators found that Jupiter was a\r\nmuch stronger long-wave radio source than would be expected for a planet\r\nwith its temperature. This radiation bore the signature of higher-energy\r\nprocesses. Physicists had seen similar emissions produced in synchrotron\r\nelectron accelerators, huge machines in which electrons are whirled\r\naround at nearly the speed of light so that they can be used for\r\nexperiments in nuclear physics. The Russian theorist I. S. Shklovsky\r\nidentified the Jovian radio radiation as also resulting from the\r\nsynchrotron process, due to spiraling electrons trapped in the planet’s\r\nmagnetic field. From the intensity and spectrum of the observed\r\nsynchrotron radiation, it was clear that both the magnetic field of the\r\nplanet and the energy of charged particles in its Van Allen belts were\r\nmuch greater than was the case for Earth.\r\n\r\nUsing radio telescopes of high sensitivity, astronomers determined the\r\napproximate strength and orientation of the magnetic field of Jupiter.\r\nAlthough they were able to measure synchrotron radiation only from the\r\ninnermost parts of the Jovian magnetosphere, they could infer that the\r\ntotal volume occupied by the magnetosphere was enormous. If our eyes\r\nwere sensitive to magnetospheric emissions, Jupiter would look more than\r\ntwice the diameter of the full moon in the sky.\r\n\r\nAll four Galilean satellites orbit within the magnetosphere of Jupiter;\r\nin contrast, our Moon lies well outside the terrestrial magnetosphere.\r\nStriking evidence of the interaction of the satellites and the\r\nmagnetosphere was provided when it was found that the innermost large\r\nsatellite—Io—actually affects the bursts of radio static produced by\r\nJupiter. Only when Io is at certain places in its orbit are these strong\r\nbursts detected. Theorists suggested that electric currents flowing\r\nbetween the satellite and the planet might be responsible for this\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Jovian Satellites\r\n\r\nFor nearly three centuries after their discovery in 1610, the only known\r\nmoons of Jupiter were the four large Galilean satellites. In 1892 E. E.\r\nBarnard, an American astronomer, found a much smaller fifth satellite\r\norbiting very close to the planet, and between 1904 and 1974 eight\r\nadditional satellites were found far outside the orbits of the Galilean\r\nsatellites. The outer satellites are quite faint and presumably no more\r\nthan a few tens of kilometers in diameter, and all have orbits that are\r\nmuch less regular than those of the five inner satellites. Four of them\r\nrevolve in a retrograde direction, opposite to that of the inner\r\nsatellites and Jupiter itself.\r\n\r\nIn 1975 the International Astronomical Union assumed the responsibility\r\nfor assigning names to the non-Galilean satellites of Jupiter. Following\r\ntradition, they named the inner satellite Amalthea for the she-goat that\r\nsuckled the young god Jupiter. The outer eight were named for lovers of\r\nJupiter: Leda, Himalia, Lysithea, Elara, Ananke, Carme, Pasiphae, and\r\nSinope. For the non-Galilean satellites, the “e” ending is reserved for\r\nsatellites with retrograde orbits; those with normal orbits have names\r\nthat end in “a.”\r\n\r\nBecause they are so large, the Galilean satellites have attracted the\r\nmost attention from astronomers. More than fifty years ago large\r\ntelescopes were used to estimate their sizes, and a careful series of\r\nmeasurements of their light variation showed that all four always keep\r\nthe same face pointed toward Jupiter, just as our Moon always turns the\r\nsame face toward Earth. Also, the subtle gravitational perturbations\r\nthey exert on each other were used to determine the approximate mass of\r\neach.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The pattern of the Galilean satellites changes from\r\n    hour to hour, as seen from Earth. Viewed edge-on, the nearly\r\n    circular orbits produce an apparent back and forth motion with\r\n    respect to Jupiter. These images recreate the kinds of observations\r\n    first made by Galileo in 1610.]\r\n\r\nCallisto, the outermost Galilean satellite, is larger than the planet\r\nMercury. It also has the lowest reflectivity, or albedo, of the four,\r\nsuggesting that its surface may be composed of some rather dark,\r\ncolorless rock. Callisto takes just over two weeks to orbit once around\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nGanymede, which requires only seven days for one orbit, is the largest\r\nsatellite in the Jovian system, being only slightly smaller than the\r\nplanet Mars. Its albedo is much higher than that of Callisto, or of the\r\nrocky planets such as Mercury, Mars, or the Moon. In 1971 astronomers\r\nfirst measured the infrared spectrum of reflected sunlight from Ganymede\r\nand found the characteristic absorptions of water ice, indicating that\r\nthis satellite is partially covered with highly reflective snow or ice.\r\n\r\nEuropa, which is slightly smaller than the Moon, circles Jupiter in half\r\nthe time required by Ganymede. Its surface reflects about sixty percent\r\nof the incident sunlight, and the infrared spectrum shows prominent\r\nabsorptions due to water ice; Europa appears to be almost entirely\r\ncovered with ice. However, its color in the visible and ultraviolet part\r\nof the spectrum is not that of ice, so some other material must also be\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIo, innermost of the Galilean satellites, is the same size as our Moon.\r\nIt orbits the planet in 42 hours, half the period of Europa. Like\r\nEuropa, it has a very high reflectivity, but, unlike Europa, it has no\r\nspectral absorptions indicative of water ice. Before Voyager,\r\nidentification of the surface material on Io presented a major problem\r\nto planetary astronomers.\r\n\r\nWhen the sizes and masses of these satellites were measured, astronomers\r\ncould calculate their densities. The inner two, Io and Europa, both have\r\ndensities about three times that of water—nearly the same as the density\r\nof the Moon, or of rocks in the crust of the Earth. Callisto and\r\nGanymede have densities only half as large, far too low to be consistent\r\nwith a rocky composition. The most plausible alternative to rock is a\r\ncomposition that includes ice as a major component. Calculations showed\r\nthat if these satellites were composed of rock and ice, approximately\r\nequal quantities of each were required to account for the measured\r\ndensity. Thus the two outer Galilean satellites were thought to\r\nrepresent a new kind of solar system object, as large as one of the\r\nterrestrial planets, but composed in large part of ice.\r\n\r\nIn 1973 the attention of astronomers was dramatically drawn to Io when\r\nRobert Brown of Harvard University detected the faint yellow glow of\r\nsodium from the region of space surrounding it. It seemed that this\r\nsatellite had an atmosphere, composed of the metal sodium! Continued\r\nobservations showed, however, that this was not an atmosphere in the\r\nusual sense of the word. The gas atoms were not bound gravitationally to\r\nIo, but continuously escaped from it to form a gigantic cloud enveloping\r\nthe orbit of the satellite. Fraser Fanale and Dennis Matson of the\r\nCaltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory suggested that bombardment of Io by\r\nhigh-energy particles from the Jovian Van Allen belts was knocking off\r\natoms of sodium by a process called sputtering, releasing these atoms\r\nand allowing them to expand outward to form the observed sodium cloud.\r\nNo one anticipated then that powerful volcanic eruptions on Io might\r\nalso be contributing to this remarkable gas cloud.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Galilean satellites in orbit around Jupiter,\r\n    along with the outer satellites, constitute a miniature solar\r\n    system. Here they are shown relative to the size of Mercury and that\r\n    of the Moon. The portrayal of their internal and external\r\n    composition is based on theoretical models that preceded the Voyager\r\n    flybys. [PC-17054AC]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: This image of Io’s extended sodium cloud was taken\r\n    February 19, 1977, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Table Mountain\r\n    Observatory. A picture of Jupiter, drawings of the orbital geometry,\r\n    and Io’s disk (the small circle on the left) are included for\r\n    perspective. The sodium cloud image has been processed for removal\r\n    of sky background, instrumental effects, and the like. This\r\n    photograph demonstrates that the cloud is highly elongated and that\r\n    more sodium precedes Io in its orbit than trails it. [P-20047]]\r\n\r\nThis picture of the satellites was developed just as the first space\r\nprobe reached the Jovian system. In the next chapter we describe the\r\nPioneer program by which scientists reached out across nearly a million\r\nkilometers of space to explore Jupiter, its magnetosphere, and its\r\nsystem of satellites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneer 10 was launched on March 2, 1972, at 8:49\r\n    p.m. from Cape Canaveral, Florida. A powerful Atlas-Centaur rocket\r\n    served as the launch vehicle, which propelled the space probe to its\r\n    goal nearly a billion kilometers away. The beauty of the night\r\n    launch was enhanced by the rumbling thunder and flashing lightning\r\n    of a nearby storm.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 2\r\n                          PIONEERS TO JUPITER\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Reaching for the Outer Planets\r\n\r\nSince the beginning of the Space Age, scientists had dreamed of sending\r\nprobes to Jupiter and its family of satellites. Initially, robot\r\nspacecraft were limited to studying the Earth and its Moon. In 1962,\r\nhowever, the first true interplanetary explorer, Mariner 2, succeeded in\r\nescaping the Earth-Moon system and crossing 100 million kilometers of\r\nspace to encounter Venus, studying Earth’s sister planet at close range\r\nusing half a dozen scientific instruments. By the mid 1960s a U.S.\r\nplanetary spacecraft had also flown to Mars, there had been a second\r\nflyby of Venus, and an ambitious program was under way for two more\r\nflybys of Mars in 1969, followed by a Mars orbiter in 1971. Based on\r\nthis success with the inner planets, NASA scientists and engineers began\r\nto plan seriously to meet the challenge of the outer solar system.\r\n\r\nNot only Jupiter, but Saturn and even Uranus and Neptune, were\r\nconsidered as possible targets. However, the distances between the outer\r\nplanets are so vast that many years of flight would be required for a\r\nspacecraft to reach them, even using the most powerful rocket boosters\r\nthen contemplated. If a cautious exploration program were followed,\r\ninvestigating one planet at a time before designing the next mission, it\r\nwould be well into the twenty-first century before even a first\r\nreconnaissance of the solar system could be achieved. A way to bridge\r\nthe space between planets in a more efficient, economical manner was\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nIn the late 1960s celestial mechanicians—scientists who study the\r\nmotions of planets and spacecraft—began to solve problems posed by the\r\nimmensity of the outer solar system. If a spacecraft is aimed to fly\r\nclose to a planet in just the right way, it can be accelerated by the\r\ngravity of the planet to higher speeds than could ever be obtained by\r\ndirect launch from Earth. If a second, more distant planet is in the\r\ncorrect alignment, the gravity boost given by the first encounter can\r\nspeed the craft on to the second. Jupiter, with its huge size and strong\r\ngravitational pull, could be used as the fulcrum for a series of\r\nmissions to Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and even distant Pluto. In\r\naddition, the early 1980s would offer an exceptional opportunity, one\r\nrepeated only about once every two centuries. At that time, all four\r\ngiant planets would be in approximate alignment, so that gravity-assist\r\nmaneuvers could be done sequentially. A single spacecraft, after being\r\nboosted from Jupiter to Saturn, could use the acceleration of Saturn to\r\ncontinue to Uranus, and in turn could be accelerated all the way out to\r\nNeptune. Such an ambitious, multiplanet mission was named the Grand\r\nTour.\r\n\r\nThe first essential step in the Grand Tour was a flyby of Jupiter.\r\nHowever, this planet is ten times farther away from Earth than Venus or\r\nMars. In addition, there were two potentially lethal hazards that had\r\nnot been faced before in interplanetary flights: the asteroid belt and\r\nthe Jovian magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nThe first danger was presented by the many thousands of asteroids that\r\noccupy a belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. The largest\r\nasteroid, Ceres, was discovered in 1801 and was initially thought to be\r\nthe “missing planet” sometimes hypothesized as lying between Jupiter and\r\nMars. However, Ceres is only 1000 kilometers in diameter, too small to\r\ndeserve the title of planet. Hundreds more of these minor planets were\r\ndiscovered during the nineteenth century, and by the 1960s more than\r\n3000 had well-determined orbits. Most were only a few tens of kilometers\r\nin diameter, and astronomers estimated that 50 000 existed that were 1\r\nkilometer or more in diameter. Any spacecraft to Jupiter would have to\r\ncross this congested region of space.\r\n\r\nEven 50 000 minor bodies spread through the volume of space occupied by\r\nthe asteroid belt would present little direct danger, although a chance\r\ncollision with an uncatalogued object was always possible. Much more\r\nserious was the possibility that these larger objects were accompanied\r\nby large amounts of debris, from the size of boulders down to\r\nmicroscopic dust, that were undetectable from Earth. Collisions with\r\npebble-sized stones could easily destroy a spacecraft. The only way to\r\nevaluate this danger was to go there and find out how much small debris\r\nwas present.\r\n\r\nA second danger was posed by Jupiter itself. In order to use the gravity\r\nboost of Jupiter to speed on to another planet, a spacecraft would have\r\nto fly rather close to the giant. But this would mean passing right\r\nthrough the regions of energetic charged particles surrounding the\r\nplanet. Some estimates of the number and energy of these particles\r\nindicated that the delicate electronic brains of a spacecraft would be\r\ndamaged before it could penetrate this region. Again, only by going\r\nthere could the danger be evaluated properly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      The Pioneer Jupiter Mission\r\n\r\nIn 1969 the U.S. Congress approved the Pioneer Jupiter Mission to\r\nprovide a reconnaissance of interplanetary space between Earth and\r\nJupiter and a first close look at the giant planet itself. The Project\r\nwas assigned by NASA to the Ames Research Center in Mountain View,\r\nCalifornia. The primary objectives were defined by NASA:\r\n\r\n  Explore the interplanetary medium beyond the orbit of Mars.\r\n\r\n  Investigate the nature of the asteroid belt, assessing possible\r\n  hazards to missions to the outer planets.\r\n\r\n  Explore the environment of Jupiter, including its inner magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer spacecraft was designed for economy and reliability, based\r\non previous experience at Ames with Pioneers 6 through 9, all of which\r\nhad proven themselves by years of successful measurement of the\r\ninterplanetary medium near the Earth. Unlike the Mariner class of\r\nspacecraft being used to investigate Venus and Mars, the Pioneer craft\r\nrotated continuously around an axis pointed toward the Earth. This\r\nspinning design was extremely stable, like the wheels of a fast-moving\r\nbicycle, and required less elaborate guidance than a nonspinning craft.\r\nIn addition, the spin provided an ideal base for measurements of\r\nenergetic particles and magnetic fields in space, since the motion of\r\nthe spacecraft itself swept the viewing direction around the sky and\r\nallowed data to be acquired rapidly from many different directions. The\r\nonly major disadvantage of a spinning spacecraft is that it does not\r\nallow a stabilized platform on which to mount cameras or other\r\ninstruments that require exact pointing. Thus the spacecraft design was\r\noptimized for measurements of particles and fields in interplanetary\r\nspace and in the Jovian magnetosphere, but had limited capability for\r\nobservations of the planet and its satellites.\r\n\r\nAs finally assembled, the Pioneer Jupiter spacecraft had a mass of 258\r\nkilograms. One hundred forty watts of electrical power at Jupiter were\r\nsupplied by four radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which\r\nturned heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium into electricity.\r\nThe launch vehicle for the flight to Jupiter was an Atlas-Centaur\r\nrocket, equipped with an additional solid-propellant third stage. This\r\npowerful rocket could accelerate the spacecraft to a speed of 51 500\r\nkilometers per hour, sufficient to escape the Earth and make the\r\nbillion-kilometer trip to Jupiter in just over two years. The specific\r\nscientific investigations to be carried out on Pioneer were selected\r\ncompetitively in 1969 from proposals submitted by scientists from U.S.\r\nuniversities, industry, and NASA laboratories, and also from abroad.\r\nEleven separate instruments would be flown, in addition to two\r\nexperiments that would make use of the spacecraft itself.\r\n\r\nThree complete Pioneer spacecraft, with their payloads of 25 kilograms\r\nof scientific instruments, were built: one as a test vehicle and two for\r\nlaunch to Jupiter. One of these—the test vehicle—is now on display at\r\nthe National Air and Space Museum in Washington. The first opportunity\r\nto launch—the opening of the “launch window”—was on February 27, 1972.\r\nHowever, it was not until shortly after dark on March 2 that all systems\r\nwere ready, and Pioneer 10 began its historic trip to Jupiter.\r\n\r\nPioneer 10 was the first human artifact launched with sufficient energy\r\nto escape the solar system entirely. Fittingly, the craft carried a\r\nmessage designed for any possible alien astronauts who might, in the\r\ndistant future, find the derelict Pioneer in the vastness of\r\ninterstellar space. A small plaque fastened to the spacecraft told the\r\ntime and planet from which it had been launched, and carried a symbolic\r\ngreeting from humanity to the cosmos.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Two identical Pioneer spacecraft were designed and\r\n    fabricated by TRW Systems Group at their Redondo Beach, California\r\n    facility. Each weighed only about 260 kilograms, yet carried eleven\r\n    highly sophisticated instruments capable of operating unattended for\r\n    many years in space. Data systems on board controlled the\r\n    instrumentation, received and processed commands, and transmitted\r\n    information across the vast distance to Earth.]\r\n\r\nThe second Pioneer was to wait more than a year before launch. By\r\nfollowing far behind Pioneer 10, its trajectory—in particular how deeply\r\nit penetrated the radiation belts during Jupiter flyby—could be\r\nmodified, depending on the fate of the first spacecraft. At dusk on\r\nApril 5, 1973, Pioneer 11 blasted from the launch pad at Cape Canaveral\r\nand followed its predecessor on the long, lonely journey into the outer\r\nsolar system.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Flight to Jupiter\r\n\r\nWithin a few hours of launch, each Pioneer spacecraft shed the shroud\r\nthat had protected it and unfurled booms supporting the science\r\ninstruments and the RTG power generators. After each craft had been\r\ncarefully tracked and precise orbits calculated, small onboard rockets\r\nwere commanded to fire to correct its trajectory for exactly the desired\r\nflyby at Jupiter. Pioneer 10 was targeted to fly by the planet at a\r\nminimum distance of 3 Jupiter radii (R_J) from the center, or 2 R_J\r\n(about 140 000 kilometers) above the clouds. This close passage, inside\r\nthe orbit of Io, allowed the craft to pass behind both Io and Jupiter as\r\nseen from Earth, so that its radio beam could probe both the planet and\r\nits innermost large satellite. Pioneer 11 was intended to fly even\r\ncloser to Jupiter, but the exact targeting options were held open until\r\nafter the Pioneer 10 encounter.\r\n\r\nOn Pioneer 10, all instruments appeared to be working well as the craft\r\npassed the orbit of Mars in June 1972, just 97 days after launch. At\r\nthis point, as it headed into unexplored space, it truly became a\r\npioneer. In mid-July it began to enter the asteroid belt, and scientists\r\nand engineers anxiously watched for signs of increasing particulate\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nPioneer 10 carried two instruments designed to measure small particles\r\nin space. One, with an effective area of about 0.6 square meters,\r\nmeasured the direct impact of dust grains as small as one-billionth of a\r\ngram. The other looked for larger, more distant grains by measuring\r\nsunlight reflected from them. To the surprise of many, there was little\r\nincrease in the rate of dust impacts recorded as the craft penetrated\r\nmore and more deeply into the belt. At about 400 million kilometers from\r\nthe Sun, near the middle of the belt, there appeared to be an increase\r\nin the number of larger particles detected optically, but not to a level\r\nthat posed any hazard. In February 1973 the spacecraft emerged unscathed\r\nfrom the asteroid belt, having demonstrated that the much-feared\r\nconcentration of small debris in the belt did not exist. The pathway was\r\nopen to the outer solar system!\r\n\r\nOn November 26, 1973, the long-awaited encounter with Jupiter began. On\r\nthat date, at a distance of 6.4 million kilometers from the planet,\r\ninstruments on board Pioneer 10 detected a sudden change in the\r\ninterplanetary medium as the spacecraft crossed the point—the bow\r\nshock—at which the magnetic presence of Jupiter first becomes evident.\r\nAt the bow shock, the energetic particles of the solar wind are suddenly\r\nslowed as they approach Jupiter. At noon the next day, Pioneer 10\r\nentered the Jovian magnetosphere at a distance of 96 R_J from the\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\nAs the spacecraft hurtled inward toward regions of increasing magnetic\r\nfield strength and charged plasma particles, the instruments designed to\r\nlook at Jupiter began to play their role. A simple line-scan camera that\r\ncould build up an image from many individual brightness scans (like a\r\nnewspaper picture transmitted by wire) obtained its first pictures of\r\nthe planet, and ultraviolet and infrared photometers prepared to observe\r\nit also. By December 2, when the spacecraft had crossed the orbit of\r\nCallisto, the outermost of the large Galilean satellites, the line-scan\r\nimages were nearly equal in quality to the best telescopic photos taken\r\npreviously, and as each hour passed they improved in resolution. Near\r\nclosest approach, Pioneer 10 transmitted partial frames of Jupiter that\r\nrepresented a threefold improvement over any Earth-based pictures ever\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The asteroid belt is a region between Mars and\r\n    Jupiter that is populated by thousands of minor planets, most only a\r\n    few kilometers in diameter. Before 1970, some theorists suggested\r\n    that large quantities of abrasive dust might damage spacecraft\r\n    passing through the asteroid belt. Pioneer 10 proved that this\r\n    danger was not present, thus opening the way to the outer solar\r\n    system.]\r\n\r\n  Earth at encounter\r\n  Earth at launch\r\n  Jupiter at encounter\r\n  Jupiter at launch\r\n  Asteroid belt\r\n\r\nTension increased as the spacecraft plunged deeper into the radiation\r\nbelts of Jupiter. Would it survive the blast of x-rays and gamma-rays\r\ninduced in every part of the craft by the electrons and ions trapped by\r\nthe magnetic field of Jupiter? Several of the instruments measuring the\r\ncharged particles climbed to full scale and saturated. Others neared\r\ntheir limits but, as anxious scientists watched the data being sent\r\nback, the levels flattened off. Meanwhile, the spacecraft itself began\r\nto feel the effects of the radiation, and occasional spurious commands\r\nwere generated. Several planned high-resolution images of Jupiter and\r\nits satellites were lost because of these false signals. But again the\r\nsystem stabilized, and no more problems occurred as, just past noon on\r\nDecember 3, 1973, Pioneer 10 reached its closest point to Jupiter, 130\r\n000 kilometers above the Jovian cloud tops. Pioneer had passed its most\r\ndemanding test with flying colors, and at a news conference at Ames,\r\nNASA Planetary Program Director Robert Kraemer pronounced the mission\r\n“100 percent successful.” He added, “We sent Pioneer off to tweak a\r\ndragon’s tail, and it did that and more. It gave it a really good yank,\r\nand it managed to survive.” The Project Science Chief pronounced it “the\r\nmost exciting day of my life,” and most of the hundreds of scientists\r\nand engineers who participated in the encounter probably agreed with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nPioneer 11 continued to follow steadily, emerging from the asteroid belt\r\nin March 1974. Based on the performance and findings of Pioneer 10, it\r\nwas decided to send Pioneer 11 still closer to Jupiter, but on a more\r\ninclined trajectory. On April 19 thrusters on the spacecraft fired to\r\nmove the Pioneer 11 aimpoint just 34 000 kilometers above the clouds of\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nIn using the Pioneer 10 data to assess the hazard to Pioneer 11,\r\nscientists had to consider three aspects of the charged particle\r\nenvironment. First was the energy distribution of the particles: The\r\nmost energetic presented the most danger. Second was the flux, the rate\r\nat which particles struck the craft. Third was the total radiation dose.\r\nOne can make an analogy with a boxing match. The energy distribution\r\ntells you how hard the blows of your opponent are. The flux is a measure\r\nof how many times a minute he hits you, and the total dose measures how\r\nmany blows land. The spacecraft reacts just like a boxer; the crucial\r\nquestion is how much total dose it absorbs. Enough radiation blows, and\r\nthe system is knocked out. The trajectory chosen for Pioneer 11 resulted\r\nin higher flux, since the craft probed more deeply into Jupiter’s inner\r\nmagnetosphere than had Pioneer 10. But by moving at a high angle across\r\nthe equatorial regions where the flux is highest, the total dose could\r\nbe kept below that experienced by Pioneer 10.\r\n\r\nPioneer 11 entered the Jovian magnetosphere on November 26, 1974, just a\r\nyear after its predecessor. Closest approach took place on December 2.\r\nAs with Pioneer 10, the radiation dose taxed the spacecraft to its\r\nlimit. Again spurious commands were issued, this time affecting the\r\ninfrared radiometer more than the imaging system. The craft flew at high\r\nlatitude over the north polar region of Jupiter, an area never seen from\r\nEarth, and returned several excellent high-resolution pictures. Once\r\nmore the little Pioneers had succeeded against the odds in opening the\r\nway to the giant planets.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneer 10 and 11 encounters with Jupiter are shown\r\n    as viewed from the celestial North Pole. Pioneer 10 swung around the\r\n    giant planet in the counterclockwise direction, while Pioneer 11\r\n    followed a clockwise approach. In this view, Jupiter rotates\r\n    counterclockwise.]\r\n\r\n  Pioneer 11\r\n  Pioneer 10\r\n  Callisto\r\n  Ganymede\r\n  Europa\r\n  Io\r\n  Amalthea\r\n\r\nFollowing their encounters with Jupiter, both Pioneer spacecraft\r\nreturned to their normal routine of measuring the interplanetary medium.\r\nPioneer 10 had gained speed from the gravity field of Jupiter and became\r\nthe first craft to achieve the velocity needed to escape from the solar\r\nsystem. Pioneer 11, however, had used the pull of Jupiter to bend its\r\ntrajectory inward, aiming it across the solar system toward Saturn.\r\nFollowing the successes at Jupiter, NASA announced that Pioneer 11 would\r\nbe targeted for a close flyby of Saturn five years later, which was\r\nsuccessfully carried out in September 1979. In early 1980, far beyond\r\ntheir design lifetimes, both spacecraft were still performing\r\nbeautifully.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: In this view of Jupiter, the Great Red Spot is\r\n    prominent and the shadow of Io traverses the planetary disk. The\r\n    gross morphology of the belts and zones, with structures showing\r\n    turbulence and convective cells in the middle latitudes, is clearly\r\n    seen. The small white spots surrounded by dark rings, seen mainly in\r\n    the southern hemisphere, indicate regions of intense vertical\r\n    convective activity, somewhat similar to cumulonimbus or\r\n    thunderclouds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Jupiter Results\r\n\r\nThe scientific results of the Pioneer flybys of Jupiter were many and\r\nvaried. As is always the case, some old questions were answered and new\r\nproblems were raised by the spacecraft data. Highlights of these results\r\nare summarized below.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Photographs of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe line-scan imaging systems of Pioneer returned some remarkable\r\npictures of the planet during the two encounters, showing individual\r\nfeatures as small as 500 kilometers across. In addition, the Pioneers\r\nwere able to look at Jupiter from angles never observable from Earth.\r\n\r\nOne of the discoveries made from these pictures was the great variety of\r\ncloud structures near the boundaries between the light zones and dark\r\nbelts. Many individual cloud patterns suggested rising and falling air.\r\nThe convoluted swirls evident in these regions appeared to be the result\r\nof dynamic motions; unfortunately, with only the few “snapshots”\r\nobtained during the hours of the flyby, the actual motions of these\r\nclouds could not be followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Thermal Emission.\r\n\r\nIn the year the Pioneer Project was begun, astronomers on Earth had\r\nmeasured that Jupiter emitted more heat than it absorbed from the Sun.\r\nFrom the Earth these measurements could be made only of the sunlit part\r\nof the planet; neither the night side nor the poles could be seen. One\r\nof the main objectives of the Pioneer flybys was to determine the heat\r\nbudget accurately from temperature measurements at many points on both\r\nthe sunlit and the night sides.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer data confirmed the presence of a heat source in Jupiter and\r\nsupplied a quantitative estimate of its magnitude. The global effective\r\ntemperature was found to be -148° C, to a precision of ±3 degrees. This\r\ntemperature implies that Jupiter radiates 1.9 times as much heat as it\r\nreceives from the Sun. The corresponding internal heat source is 10¹⁷\r\nwatts. Surprisingly, the poles were as warm as the equator; apparently,\r\nthe atmosphere is very efficient at transferring solar heat absorbed\r\nnear the equator up to high latitudes, or perhaps the internal component\r\nof the heat comes preferentially from the polar regions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Helium in the Atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneer infrared experiment made the first measurement of the amount\r\nof helium on Jupiter. The ratio of the number of helium atoms to the\r\nnumber of hydrogen atoms was found to be He/H₂ = 0.14 ± 0.08. This is\r\nconsistent with the known solar ratio of He/H₂ = 0.11. Measurements of\r\nhelium in the upper atmosphere were also made by the ultraviolet\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: One of the best Pioneer images of Jupiter was\r\n    obtained at a range of 545 000 kilometers by Pioneer 11. Structure\r\n    within the Great Red Spot and the surrounding belts and zones can be\r\n    seen.

Near the equator, at a level where the atmospheric pressure is\r\nthe same as that on the surface of the Earth (1 bar), the temperature is\r\n-108° C. About 150 kilometers higher, where the pressure drops to 0.1\r\nbar, is the minimum atmospheric temperature of about -165° C. Above this\r\npoint the temperature rises again, reaching about -123° C near a\r\npressure level of 0.03 bar. Presumably this temperature rise is due to\r\nabsorption of sunlight by a thin haze of dust particles in the upper\r\natmosphere of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Internal Structure.\r\n\r\nThe measurements of the amount of helium, of the gravitational field,\r\nand of the size of the internal heat source on Jupiter greatly clarified\r\nscientists’ understanding of the deep interior of the planet.\r\nCalculations showed that the core of Jupiter must be so hot that\r\nhydrogen cannot become solid, but must remain a fluid throughout the\r\ninterior. Even at great depths, therefore, Jupiter does not have a solid\r\nsurface. The theory that the Great Red Spot was the result of\r\ninteractions with a surface feature below the clouds thus became\r\nuntenable. Whatever its exact nature, the Red Spot must be a strictly\r\natmospheric phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Magnetic Field.\r\n\r\nPioneer data showed that the magnetic field of Jupiter has a dipolar\r\nnature, like that of the Earth, but 2000 times stronger. The calculated\r\nsurface fields measured about 4 gauss, compared to a field of about 0.5\r\ngauss on the Earth. The axis of the magnetic field was tilted 11 degrees\r\nwith respect to the rotation axis, and it was offset by about 10 000\r\nkilometers (0.1 R_J) from the center of the planet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneers 10 and 11 did not obtain very detailed\r\n    pictures of the satellites of Jupiter. The best view was of\r\n    Ganymede, which showed a surface of contrasting light and dark spots\r\n    of unknown nature.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A less detailed image of Europa clearly reveals the\r\n    illuminated crescent but supplies little information about the\r\n    surface of this ice-covered satellite.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Satellite Atmospheres.\r\n\r\nTwo experiments yielded exciting new information on possible atmospheres\r\nof the Galilean satellites. First was an occultation, in which the\r\nPioneer 10 spacecraft was targeted to pass behind Io as seen from Earth.\r\nAt the moments just before the spacecraft disappeared, and just after\r\nreemergence from behind the satellite, the radio signal was influenced\r\nby a thin layer of ionized gas, in which the electrons had been stripped\r\nfrom the atoms by absorbed sunlight or by other processes. The\r\nionosphere thus discovered had a peak density of about 60 000 electrons\r\nper cubic centimeter. In addition, a very extended far-ultraviolet glow,\r\nprobably due to atomic hydrogen, was found near the orbit of Io by the\r\nultraviolet photometer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Masses of Jupiter and Its Satellites.\r\n\r\nPrecise radio tracking of the Pioneers as they coasted past Jupiter and\r\nits satellites revealed that Jupiter is about one percent heavier than\r\nhad been anticipated, and several satellites were found to have masses\r\nthat differ by more than ten percent from values determined previously.\r\nThese improvements in knowledge of the masses were required to achieve\r\nthe close satellite flybys being planned for later missions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Pioneer spacecraft carried this plaque on the\r\n    journey beyond the solar system, bearing data that tell where and\r\n    when the human species lived and that convey details of our\r\n    biological form. When Pioneer 10 flew by Jupiter it acquired\r\n    sufficient kinetic energy to carry it completely out of the solar\r\n    system. Some time between one and ten billion years from now, the\r\n    probe may pass through the planetary system of a remote stellar\r\n    neighbor, one of whose planets may have evolved intelligent life. If\r\n    the spacecraft is detected and then inspected, Pioneer’s message\r\n    will reach across the eons to communicate its greeting.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Inner Magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nA great deal of the scientific emphasis of the Pioneer missions was\r\ndirected at characterizing the particles and fields in the inner\r\nmagnetosphere, the region in which charged particles are trapped in\r\nstable orbits. The Pioneers found that it extended to about 25 R_J, well\r\nbeyond the orbit of Callisto. Within this region, instruments on the\r\nspacecraft recorded the numbers and energy of electrons, protons, and\r\nions. The electrons reached a maximum concentration near 3 R_J, and\r\ntheir numbers remained almost constant from there in toward the planet.\r\nThe maximum concentration of protons observed by Pioneer 10 was at 3.4\r\nR_J, a little inside the orbit of Io. Pioneer 11 penetrated deeper and\r\nfound another maximum, about twenty times higher, at 1.9 R_J; at this\r\ndistance, 10 million energetic protons hit each square centimeter of the\r\nspacecraft every second. It was believed that the gap between these two\r\npeaks was due to tiny Amalthea, the innermost satellite, which orbits at\r\n2.5 R_J. Apparently this satellite sweeps up the particles as it circles\r\nJupiter. Another large dip in the proton distribution was attributed to\r\nsweeping by Io, with smaller effects seen near the orbits of Europa and\r\nGanymede. There was an additional small effect at 1.8 R_J, later found\r\nby Voyager to be due to Jupiter’s ring and its fourteenth satellite.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        The Outer Magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nFrom about 25 R_J outward to its boundary near 100 R_J, the Jovian\r\nmagnetosphere is a complex and dynamic place. Beyond about 60 R_J, both\r\nPioneers found the boundary to be highly unstable, apparently blown in\r\nand out by variations in the pressure of the solar wind, which consists\r\nof charged particles flowing outward from the Sun. In this region\r\nconcentrations of Jovian particles are sometimes seen that rival the\r\ninner magnetosphere in intensity. Between 60 R_J and 25 R_J, a region\r\nsometimes called the middle magnetosphere, the particle motions are more\r\nordered, and for the most part electrons and protons are carried along\r\nwith the planet’s rotation by its magnetic field. Near the equatorial\r\nplane, the flow of these particles produces an electric current circling\r\nthe planet, and this current in turn generates its own magnetic field,\r\nwhich approaches in strength that of Jupiter itself. Occasionally the\r\nouter magnetosphere collapses down to about 60 R_J, and energetic\r\nparticles are squirted from the middle region into space; these bursts\r\nof Jovian particles can sometimes be detected as far away as Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time that Pioneer scientists were analyzing their results\r\nand developing new concepts of the Jupiter system, a new team of\r\ninvestigators had been selected for the next mission to Jupiter. From\r\nabout 1975 on, attention shifted from Pioneer to its successor—Voyager.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager spacecraft are among the most\r\n    sophisticated, automatic, and independent robots ever sent to\r\n    explore the planets.

In 1969, the\r\nsame year in which the Pioneer Project received Congressional approval,\r\nNASA began to design the Grand Tour. At the same time, the Space Science\r\nBoard of the National Academy of Sciences completed a study called “The\r\nOuter Solar System,” chaired by James Van Allen of the University of\r\nIowa, which recommended that the United States undertake an exploration\r\nprogram:\r\n\r\n  1. To conduct exploratory investigations of the appearance, size,\r\n  mass, magnetic properties, and dynamics of each of the outer planets\r\n  and their major satellites;\r\n\r\n  2. To determine the chemical and isotopic composition of the\r\n  atmospheres of the outer planets;\r\n\r\n  3. To determine whether biologically important organic substances\r\n  exist in these atmospheres and to characterize the lower atmospheric\r\n  environments in terms of biologically significant parameters;\r\n\r\n  4. To describe the motions of the atmospheres of the major planets and\r\n  to characterize their temperature-density-composition structure;\r\n\r\n  5. To make a detailed study for each of the outer planets of the\r\n  external magnetic field and respective particle population, associated\r\n  radio emissions, and magnetospheric particle-wave interactions;\r\n\r\n  6. To determine the mode of interaction of the solar wind with the\r\n  outer planets, including the interaction of the satellites with the\r\n  planets’ magnetospheres;\r\n\r\n  7. To investigate the properties of the solar wind and the\r\n  interplanetary magnetic field at great distances from the Sun at both\r\n  low and high solar latitudes, and to search for the outer boundary of\r\n  the solar wind flow;\r\n\r\n  8. To attempt to obtain the composition, energy spectra, and fluxes of\r\n  cosmic rays in interstellar space, free of the modulating effects of\r\n  the solar wind.\r\n\r\nThe report also noted that “exceptionally favorable astronomical\r\nopportunities occur in the late 1970s for multiplanet missions,” and\r\nthat “professional resources for full utilization of the\r\nouter-solar-system mission opportunities in the 1970s and 1980s are\r\namply available within the scientific community, and there is a\r\nwidespread eagerness to participate in such missions.”\r\n\r\nAn additional Academy study, chaired by Francis S. Johnson of the\r\nUniversity of Texas at Dallas and published in 1971, was even more\r\nspecific: “An extensive study of the outer solar system is recognized by\r\nus to be one of the major objectives of space science in this decade.\r\nThis endeavor is made particularly exciting by the rare opportunity to\r\nexplore several planets and satellites in one mission using long-lived\r\nspacecraft and existing propulsion systems. We recommend that\r\n[Mariner-class] spacecraft be developed and used in Grand Tour missions\r\nfor the exploration of the outer planets in a series of four launches in\r\nthe late 1970s.”\r\n\r\nThus the stage was set to initiate the Outer Planets Grand Tours. NASA’s\r\ntimetable called for dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976\r\nand 1977, and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, at\r\na total cost over the decade of the 1970s of about $750 million.\r\n\r\nA necessary step was to obtain from the scientific community the best\r\npossible set of instruments to fly on the spacecraft. Following its\r\ninitial internal studies, NASA turned for its detailed scientific\r\nplanning to an open competition in which any scientist or scientific\r\norganization was invited to propose an investigation. In October 1970\r\nNASA issued an “Invitation for Participation in the Mission Development\r\nfor Grand Tour Missions to the Outer Solar System,” and a year later it\r\nhad selected about a dozen teams of scientists to formulate specific\r\nobjectives for these missions. At the same time, an advanced spacecraft\r\nengineering design was carried out by the Caltech Jet Propulsion\r\nLaboratory (JPL), and studies were also supported by industrial\r\ncontractors. In fiscal year 1972, plans called for an appropriation by\r\nCongress of $30 million to fund these developments, leading toward a\r\nfirst launch in 1976.\r\n\r\nEven as the scientific and technical problems of the Grand Tour were\r\nbeing solved, however, political and budgetary difficulties intervened.\r\nThe Grand Tour was an ambitious and expensive concept, designed in the\r\nenthusiasm of the Apollo years. In the altered national climate that\r\nfollowed the first manned lunar landings, the United States began to\r\npull back from major commitments in space. The later Apollo landings\r\nwere canceled, and in fiscal year 1972 only $10 million of the $30\r\nmillion needed to complete Grand Tour designs was appropriated. It\r\nsuddenly became necessary to restructure the exploration of the outer\r\nplanets to conform to more modest space budgets.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The original plan for the Outer Planets Grand Tour\r\n    envisaged dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in the\r\n    mid-1970s, and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in\r\n    1979. However, political and budgetary constraints altered the plan,\r\n    and the Voyager mission to Jupiter and Saturn, with an optional\r\n    encounter with Uranus, was formulated to replace it. Here the\r\n    original Grand Tour trajectories from Earth to the outer planets are\r\n    shown. [P-10612AC]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Redesign of the Mission\r\n\r\nThe new mission concept that replaced the Grand Tour dropped the\r\nobjectives of exploring the outer three planets—Uranus, Neptune, and\r\nPluto. In this way the lifetime of the mission was greatly shortened,\r\nplacing less stringent demands on the reliability of the millions of\r\ncomponents that go into a spacecraft. Limiting the mission to Jupiter\r\nand Saturn also relieved problems associated with spacecraft power, and\r\nwith communicating effectively over distances of more than 2 billion\r\nkilometers. The total cost of the new mission was estimated at $250\r\nmillion, only a third of that previously planned for the Grand Tour.\r\nBecause it was based on the proven Mariner spacecraft design, the new\r\nmission was initially named Mariner Jupiter Saturn, or MJS; in 1977 the\r\nname was changed to Voyager. In January 1972 the President’s proposed\r\nfiscal year 1973 budget included $10 million specifically designated for\r\nVoyager; after authorization and appropriation by Congress, the official\r\nbeginning of Voyager was set for July 1, 1972.\r\n\r\nWith approval of the new mission apparently assured in the Congress,\r\nNASA issued an “Announcement of Flight Opportunity” to select the\r\nscientific instruments to be carried on Voyager. Seventy-seven proposals\r\nwere received; 31 from groups of scientists with designs for\r\ninstruments, and 46 from individuals desiring to participate in\r\nNASA-formed teams. Of these 77 proposals, 24 were from NASA\r\nlaboratories, 48 were from scientists in various U.S. universities and\r\nindustry, and 5 were from foreign sources. After extensive review, 28\r\nproposals were accepted: 9 for instruments and 19 for individual\r\nparticipation. The newly selected Principal Investigators and Team\r\nLeaders met for the first time at JPL just before Christmas, 1972. To\r\ncoordinate all the science activity of the Voyager mission, NASA and JPL\r\nselected Edward Stone of Caltech, a distinguished expert on\r\nmagnetospheric physics, to serve as Project Scientist.\r\n\r\nThe team assembled in 1972 by JPL and its industrial contractors\r\nincluded more than a thousand highly trained engineers, scientists, and\r\ntechnical managers who assumed responsibility for the awesome task of\r\nbuilding the most sophisticated unmanned spacecraft ever designed and\r\nlaunching it across the farthest reaches of the solar system. At the\r\nhead of the organization was the Project Manager, Harris (Bud)\r\nSchurmeier. Later, Schurmeier was succeeded by John Casani, Robert\r\nParks, and Ray Heacock. This team had only four years to turn the paper\r\nconcepts into hardware, ready to deliver to Kennedy Space Center for\r\nlaunch in the summer of 1977.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Project Scientist Edward C. Stone]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Project Manager Harris (Bud) Schurmeier]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       The Objectives of Voyager\r\n\r\nVoyager is one of the most ambitious planetary space missions ever\r\nundertaken. Voyager 1, which encountered Jupiter on March 5, 1979, was\r\nto investigate Jupiter, its large satellites Io, Ganymede, and Callisto,\r\nand tiny Amalthea; Saturn, its rings, and several of its\r\nsatellites—including Titan, the largest satellite in the solar system.\r\nVoyager 2, which arrived at Jupiter on July 9, 1979, was to examine\r\nJupiter, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Saturn and several of its\r\nsatellites, after which it was to be hurled on toward an encounter with\r\nthe Uranian system in 1986. Both spacecraft were also designed to study\r\nthe interplanetary medium and its interactions with the solar wind.\r\n\r\nScientific objectives as well as the orbital positions of the planets\r\nand satellites influenced the choice of spacecraft trajectories, which\r\nwere designed to provide close flybys of all four of Jupiter’s Galilean\r\nsatellites and six of Saturn’s satellites—featuring a very close\r\napproach to Titan—and occultations of the Sun and Earth by Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, Titan, and the rings of Saturn. However, all these objectives\r\ncould not be accomplished by a single spacecraft. No single path through\r\nthe Jupiter system, for instance, can provide close flybys of all four\r\nGalilean satellites. Specifically, a trajectory for Voyager 1 that\r\nincluded a close encounter with Io precluded a close encounter with\r\nEuropa and did not allow the spacecraft the option of being targeted\r\nfrom Saturn to Uranus without having to travel through the rings of\r\nSaturn. On the other hand, a trajectory that would send Voyager 2 on to\r\nUranus precluded not only a close encounter with Io, but also a close\r\nencounter with Titan and with Saturn’s rings. The alignment of the\r\nplanets and their satellites was such that encounter with Jupiter on or\r\nbefore April 4, 1979 was necessary for optimum investigation of Io, but\r\nencounter with Jupiter after June 15, 1979 was mandatory for a\r\ntrajectory that would maintain the option to go on to Uranus. The latter\r\ntrajectory also allowed Voyager 2 to maintain a healthier distance from\r\nJupiter, avoiding the full dose of radiation that would be experienced\r\nby Voyager 1.\r\n\r\nAlthough the two Voyager trajectories do have certain fundamental\r\ndifferences, they also have a great deal in common: Both spacecraft were\r\ndesigned to study the interplanetary medium, and both would investigate\r\nJupiter and Saturn and have close flybys with several of their major\r\nsatellites. Also, if it were decided not to send Voyager 2 on to Uranus,\r\nthis spacecraft could be retargeted to a Saturn trajectory similar to\r\nthat of Voyager 1, providing a close flyby of Titan and a closer look at\r\nthe rings. The flight paths of Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 complement each\r\nother—allowing the planets and some of the satellites to be viewed from\r\na number of angles and over a longer period of time than would be\r\npossible with only one spaceprobe—yet the trajectories were also\r\ndesigned to be more or less capable of duplicating each other’s\r\nscientific investigations. This redundancy helps to ensure, so far as is\r\npossible, the success of the mission.\r\n\r\nThe redundancy built into the mission is evident, not only in the design\r\nof the trajectories, but in the spacecraft themselves. Voyagers 1 and 2\r\nare identical spacecraft. In addition, many crucial elements are\r\nduplicated on each: For example, the computer command subsystem (CCS),\r\nthe flight data subsystem (FDS), and the attitude and articulation\r\ncontrol subsystem (AACS)—which function as onboard control systems—each\r\nhave multiple reprogrammable digital computers. In addition, the CCS,\r\nwhich decodes commands from ground control and can instruct other\r\nsubsystems from its own memory, contains duplicates for all its\r\nfunctional units. The AACS, which controls the spacecraft’s\r\nstabilization and orientation, has duplicate star trackers and Sun\r\nsensors. The communications system contains two radio receivers and four\r\ntransmitters, two each to transmit both S-band (frequency of about 2295\r\nmegahertz) and X-band (frequency of about 8418 megahertz).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Project Manager John Casani]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Spacecraft\r\n\r\nThe Voyager spacecraft are more sophisticated, more automatic, and more\r\nindependent than were the Pioneers. This independence is important\r\nbecause the giant planets are so far away that the correction of a\r\nmalfunction by engineers on Earth would take hours to perform. Even at\r\n“nearby” Jupiter, radio signals take about forty minutes to travel in\r\none direction between the spacecraft and Earth. Saturn is about twice as\r\nfar away as Jupiter, and Uranus is twice as far as Saturn, slowing\r\ncommunication even more.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: About the same size and weight of a subcompact car,\r\n    the Voyager spacecraft carry instruments for eleven science\r\n    investigations of the outer planets and their satellites.

The Voyager itself, with a mass of 815\r\nkilograms and typical dimensions of about 3 meters, is almost the size\r\nand weight of a subcompact car—but enormously more complex. A better\r\nanalogy might be made with a large electronic computer—but no\r\nterrestrial computer was ever asked to supply its own power source and\r\nto operate unattended in the vacuum of space for up to a decade.\r\n\r\nEach Voyager spacecraft carries instruments for eleven science\r\ninvestigations covering visual, infrared, and ultraviolet regions of the\r\nspectrum, and other remote sensing studies of the planets and\r\nsatellites; studies of radio emissions, magnetic fields, cosmic rays,\r\nand lower energy particles; plasma (ionized gases) waves and particles;\r\nand studies using the spacecraft radios. Each Voyager has a science boom\r\nthat holds high and low resolution TV, photopolarimeter, plasma and\r\ncosmic ray detectors, infrared spectrometer and radiometer, ultraviolet\r\nspectrometer, and low energy charged particle detector; in addition,\r\neach spacecraft has a planetary radio astronomy and plasma wave antenna\r\nand a long boom carrying a low- and a high-field magnetometer.\r\n\r\nCommunication with Earth is carried out via a high-gain antenna 3.7\r\nmeters in diameter, with a smaller low-gain antenna as backup. The large\r\nwhite dish of the high-gain antenna dominates the appearance of the\r\nspacecraft, setting it off from its predecessors, which were able to use\r\nmuch smaller antennas to communicate over the more modest distances that\r\nseparate the planets of the inner solar system. Although the transmitter\r\npower is only 23 watts—about the power of a refrigerator light bulb—this\r\nsystem is designed to transmit data over a billion kilometers at the\r\nenormous rate of 115 200 bits per second. Data can also be stored for\r\nlater transmission to Earth; an onboard digital tape recorder has a\r\ncapacity of about 500 million (5 × 10⁸) bits, sufficient to store nearly\r\n100 Voyager images.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Project Manager Ray Heacock]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: During the early assembly stage, technicians at\r\n    Caltech’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory equip Voyager’s extendable boom\r\n    with low- and high-field magnetometers that measure the intensity\r\n    and direction of the outer planets’ magnetic fields. [373-7179BC]]\r\n\r\nRadioisotope thermoelectric generator (RTGs), rather than solar cells,\r\nprovide electricity for the Voyager spacecraft. The RTG use radioactive\r\nplutonium oxide for this purpose. As the plutonium oxide decays, it\r\ngives off heat which is converted to electricity, supplying a total of\r\nabout 450 watts to the spacecraft at launch. This power slowly declines\r\nas the plutonium is used up, with less than 400 watts expected at Saturn\r\nflyby five years after launch. Hydrazine fuel is used to make mid-course\r\ncorrections in trajectory and to control the spacecraft’s orientation.\r\n\r\nSince the Voyagers must fly through the inner magnetosphere of Jupiter,\r\nit was imperative that the hardware systems be able to withstand the\r\nradiation from Jovian charged particles. The electronic microcircuits\r\nthat form the heart and brain of the spacecraft and its scientific\r\ninstruments are especially susceptible to radiation damage. Three\r\ntechniques were used to “harden” components against radiation:\r\n\r\n  1. Special design using radiation-resistant materials;\r\n\r\n  2. Extensive testing to select those electronic components which come\r\n  out of the manufacturing process with highest reliability; and\r\n\r\n  3. Spot shielding of especially sensitive areas with\r\n  radiation-absorbing materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  VOYAGER’S GREETINGS TO THE UNIVERSE\r\n\r\nThe Voyager spacecraft will be the third and fourth human artifacts to\r\nescape entirely from the solar system. Pioneers 10 and 11, which\r\npreceded Voyager in outstripping the gravitational attraction of the\r\nSun, both carried small metal plaques identifying their time and place\r\nof origin for the benefit of any other spacefarers that might find them\r\nin the distant future. With this example before them, NASA placed a more\r\nambitious message aboard Voyager 1 and 2—a kind of time capsule,\r\nintended to communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials.\r\n\r\nThe Voyager message is carried by a phonograph record—a 12-inch\r\ngold-plated copper disk containing sounds and images selected to portray\r\nthe diversity of life and culture on Earth. The contents of the record\r\nwere selected for NASA by a committee chaired by Carl Sagan of Cornell\r\nUniversity. Dr. Sagan and his associates assembled 115 images and a\r\nvariety of natural sounds, such as those made by surf, wind and thunder,\r\nbirds, whales, and other animals. To this they added musical selections\r\nfrom different cultures and eras, and spoken greetings from Earthpeople\r\nin sixty languages, and printed messages from President Carter and U.N.\r\nSecretary General Waldheim.\r\n\r\nEach record is encased in a protective aluminum jacket, together with a\r\ncartridge and needle. Instructions, in symbolic language, explain the\r\norigin of the spacecraft and indicate how the record is to be played.\r\nThe 115 images are encoded in analog form. The remainder of the record\r\nis in audio, designed to be played at 16⅔ revolutions per second. It\r\ncontains the spoken greetings, beginning with Akkadian, which was spoken\r\nin Sumer about six thousand years ago, and ending with Wu, a modern\r\nChinese dialect. Following the section on the sounds of Earth, there is\r\nan eclectic 90-minute selection of music, including both Eastern and\r\nWestern classics and a variety of ethnic music.\r\n\r\nOnce the Voyager spacecraft leave the solar system (by 1990, both will\r\nbe beyond the orbit of Pluto), they will find themselves in empty space.\r\nIt will be forty thousand years before they come within a light year of\r\na star, called AC + 79 3888, and millions of years before either might\r\nmake a close approach to any other planetary system. As Carl Sagan has\r\nnoted, “The spacecraft will be encountered and the record played only if\r\nthere are advanced spacefaring civilizations in interstellar space. But\r\nthe launching of this bottle into the cosmic ocean says something very\r\nhopeful about life on this planet.”\r\n\r\n                      LANGUAGES ON VOYAGER RECORD\r\n\r\n  Sumerian\r\n  Akkadian\r\n  Hittite\r\n  Hebrew\r\n  Aramaic\r\n  English\r\n  Portuguese\r\n  Cantonese\r\n  Russian\r\n  Thai\r\n  Arabic\r\n  Roumanian\r\n  French\r\n  Burmese\r\n  Spanish\r\n  Indonesian\r\n  Kechua\r\n  Dutch\r\n  German\r\n  Bengali\r\n  Urdu\r\n  Hindi\r\n  Vietnamese\r\n  Sinhalese\r\n  Greek\r\n  Latin\r\n  Japanese\r\n  Punjabi\r\n  Turkish\r\n  Welsh\r\n  Italian\r\n  Nguni\r\n  Sotho\r\n  Wu\r\n  Korean\r\n  Armenian\r\n  Polish\r\n  Netali\r\n  Mandarin\r\n  Gujorati\r\n  Ila (Zambia)\r\n  Nyanja\r\n  Swedish\r\n  Ukrainian\r\n  Persian\r\n  Serbian\r\n  Luganada\r\n  Amoy (Min dialect)\r\n  Marathi\r\n  Kannada\r\n  Telugu\r\n  Oriya\r\n  Hungarian\r\n  Czech\r\n  Rajasthani\r\n\r\n                   SOUNDS OF EARTH ON VOYAGER RECORD\r\n\r\n  Whales\r\n  Planets (music)\r\n  Volcanoes\r\n  Mud pots\r\n  Rain\r\n  Surf\r\n  Crickets, frogs\r\n  Birds\r\n  Hyena\r\n  Elephant\r\n  Chimpanzee\r\n  Wild dog\r\n  Footsteps and heartbeats\r\n  Laughter\r\n  Fire\r\n  Tools\r\n  Dogs, domestic\r\n  Herding sheep\r\n  Blacksmith shop\r\n  Sawing\r\n  Riveter\r\n  Morse code\r\n  Ships\r\n  Horse and cart\r\n  Horse and carriage\r\n  Train whistle\r\n  Tractor\r\n  Truck\r\n  Auto gears\r\n  Jet\r\n  Lift-off Saturn 5 rocket\r\n  Kiss\r\n  Baby\r\n  Life signs—EEG, EKG\r\n  Pulsart\r\n\r\n                    VOYAGER RECORD PHOTOGRAPH INDEX\r\n\r\n  Calibration circle\r\n  Solar location map\r\n  Mathematical definitions\r\n  Physical unit definitions\r\n  Solar system parameters\r\n  The Sun\r\n  Solar spectrum\r\n  Mercury\r\n  Mars\r\n  Jupiter\r\n  Earth\r\n  Egypt, Red Sea, Sinai Peninsula and the Nile\r\n  Chemical definitions\r\n  DNA structure\r\n  DNA structure magnified\r\n  Cells and cell division\r\n  Anatomy (eight)\r\n  Human sex organs\r\n  Diagram of conception\r\n  Conception\r\n  Fertilized ovum\r\n  Fetus diagram\r\n  Fetus\r\n  Diagram of male and female\r\n  Birth\r\n  Nursing mother\r\n  Father and daughter (Malaysia)\r\n  Group of children\r\n  Diagram of family ages\r\n  Family portrait\r\n  Diagram of continental drift\r\n  Structure of Earth\r\n  Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef of Australia)\r\n  Seashore\r\n  Snake River and Grand Tetons\r\n  Sand dunes\r\n  Monument Valley\r\n  Forest scene with mushrooms\r\n  Leaf\r\n  Fallen leaves\r\n  Sequoia\r\n  Snowflake\r\n  Tree with daffodils\r\n  Flying insect with flowers\r\n  Diagram of vertebrate evolution\r\n  Seashell (Xancidae)\r\n  Dolphins\r\n  School of fish\r\n  Tree toad\r\n  Crocodile\r\n  Eagle\r\n  Waterhold\r\n  Jane Goodall and chimps\r\n  Sketch of Bushmen\r\n  Bushmen hunters\r\n  Man from Guatemala\r\n  Dancer from Bali\r\n  Andean girls\r\n  Thailand craftsman\r\n  Elephant\r\n  Old man with beard and glasses (Turkey)\r\n  Old man with dog and flowers\r\n  Mountain climber\r\n  Cathy Rigby\r\n  Sprinters\r\n  Schoolroom\r\n  Children with globe\r\n  Cotton harvest\r\n  Grape picker\r\n  Supermarket\r\n  Underwater scene with diver and fish\r\n  Fishing boat with nets\r\n  Cooking fish\r\n  Chinese dinner party\r\n  Demonstration of licking, eating and drinking\r\n  Great Wall of China\r\n  House construction (African)\r\n  Construction scene (Amish country)\r\n  House (Africa)\r\n  House (New England)\r\n  Modern house (Cloudcroft, New Mexico)\r\n  House interior with artist and fire\r\n  Taj Mahal\r\n  English city (Oxford)\r\n  Boston\r\n  UN Building, day\r\n  UN Building, night\r\n  Sydney Opera House\r\n  Artisan with drill\r\n  Factory interior\r\n  Museum\r\n  X-ray of hand\r\n  Woman with microscope\r\n  Street scene, Asia (Pakistan)\r\n  Rush hour traffic, India\r\n  Modern highway (Ithaca)\r\n  Golden Gate Bridge\r\n  Train\r\n  Airplane in flight\r\n  Airport (Toronto)\r\n  Antarctic expedition\r\n  Radio telescope (Westerbork, Netherlands)\r\n  Radio telescope (Arecibo)\r\n  Page of book (Newton, _System of the World_)\r\n  Astronaut in space\r\n  Titan Centaur launch\r\n  Sunset with birds\r\n  String quartet (Quartetto Italiano)\r\n  Violin with music score (Cavatina)\r\n\r\n                        MUSIC ON VOYAGER RECORD\r\n\r\n  Bach Brandenberg Concerto Number Two, First Movement\r\n  “Kinds of Flowers” Javanese Court Gamelan\r\n  Senegalese Percussion\r\n  Pygmy girls initiation song\r\n  Australian Horn and Totem song\r\n  “El Cascabel” Lorenzo Barcelata\r\n  “Johnny B.

These\r\ncapabilities resulted from three interconnected onboard computer\r\nsystems: the AACS (attitude and articulation control subsystem); the FDS\r\n(flight data subsystem); and the CCS (computer command system).\r\nOperating from “loads” of instructions transmitted earlier from Earth,\r\nthese computers could issue commands to the spacecraft and the science\r\ninstruments and react automatically to problems or changes in operating\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe complex sequence of scientific observations and the associated\r\nengineering functions were executed by the spacecraft under the control\r\nof an updatable program stored in the CCS by ground command. At\r\nappropriate times, the CCS issued commands to the AACS for movement of\r\nthe scan platform or spacecraft maneuvers; to the FDS for changes in\r\ninstrument configuration or telemetry rate; or to numerous other\r\nsubsystems within the spacecraft for specific actions. The two identical\r\n(redundant) 4096-word memories within the CCS contained both fixed\r\nroutines (about 2800 words) and a variable section (about 1290 words)\r\nfor changing science sequencing functions. A single 1290-word science\r\nsequence load could easily generate 300 000 discrete commands, thus\r\nproviding significantly more sequencing capability than would be\r\npossible through ground commands. A 1290-word sequencing load in the CCS\r\ncontrolled both the science and engineering functions of the spacecraft\r\nfor a period lasting for ¾ day at closest approach and for up to 100\r\ndays during cruise.\r\n\r\nEach 1290-word program (or load) was built from specific science\r\nmeasurement units called links. Some links were used repeatedly in a\r\nlooping cyclic (like a computer DO loop) to perform the same observation\r\nnumerous times; other links that involved special measurement geometry\r\nor critical timing occurred only once. About 175 science links were\r\ndefined for the Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter. It took almost two years to\r\nconvert the desired science objectives and measurements first into\r\nlinks, then into a minute-by-minute timeline for the 98-day encounter\r\nperiod, and finally into the specific computer instructions that could\r\nbe loaded into the CCS memory for that portion of the encounter time\r\nrepresented by a particular load. The total Voyager 1 Jupiter encounter\r\nperiod used eighteen sequence memory loads, supplemented by about 1000\r\nground commands to modify the sequences because of changing conditions\r\nor calibration requirements.\r\n\r\nFor the Voyager 2 encounter, concern about the ailing spacecraft\r\nreceiver limited the number of loads that could be transmitted,\r\nparticularly while the spacecraft was deep within the Jovian\r\nmagnetosphere, where radiation effects caused the receiver frequency to\r\ndrift unpredictably. However, a careful redesign of the planned\r\nsequences permitted the accomplishment of very nearly the original set\r\nof observations even with these constraints.\r\n\r\nAll three approaches were required on the Voyager craft, especially\r\nafter Pioneer 10 and 11 demonstrated that the radiation at Jupiter was\r\neven more intense than had been assumed in early design studies.\r\n\r\nThe steady streams of engineering and scientific data received on Earth\r\nare transmitted from the receiving stations of the Deep Space Network\r\n(DSN) to JPL, where the Voyager control functions are centered. There,\r\ndozens of technicians check and recheck every subsystem to search for\r\nthe slightest hint of malfunction. In case of problems, there are thick\r\nnotebooks of instructions and racks of precoded computer tapes ready to\r\nbe used to correct any apparent malfunction.\r\n\r\nNormally Voyager runs itself. Detailed instructions are programmed into\r\nits onboard computers and command systems for dealing with such\r\npotential emergencies as a stuck valve in the fuel system, loss of\r\norientation in the star trackers, erratic gyroscope functions, failure\r\nof radio communications, or a thousand and one other nightmares. The\r\ninstructions for operating the scientific instruments are also stored on\r\nboard, with new blocks of commands sent up once every few days to\r\nreplace those for tasks already completed. Whether in the calm of cruise\r\nmode or the intense excitement of a planetary encounter, the Voyager\r\ncraft is alone in space, continuously sensing and reacting to its\r\nenvironment, tied by only a tenuous thread of radio communication to the\r\nanxious watchers back on Earth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Project Manager Robert Parks]\r\n\r\n                       NASA PLANETARY MISSIONS\r\n    Spacecraft       Launch    Destination   Encounter    Type of\r\n                      Date                      Date     Encounter\r\n\r\n  Mariner 2           8/26/62  Venus           12/14/62  flyby\r\n  Mariner 4          11/28/64  Mars             7/14/65  flyby\r\n  Mariner 5           6/14/67  Venus           10/19/67  flyby\r\n  Mariner 6           2/25/69  Mars             7/31/69  flyby\r\n  Mariner 7           3/27/69  Mars             8/05/69  flyby\r\n  Mariner 9           5/30/71  Mars            11/13/71  orbiter\r\n  Pioneer 10          3/03/72  Jupiter         12/04/73  flyby\r\n  Pioneer 11          4/06/73  Jupiter         12/03/74  flyby\r\n                               Saturn           9/01/79  flyby\r\n  Mariner 10         11/03/73  Venus            2/05/74  flyby\r\n                               Mercury          3/29/74  flyby\r\n  Viking 1            8/20/75  Mars             6/19/76  orbiter\r\n                                                7/20/76  lander\r\n  Viking 2            9/09/75  Mars             7/07/76  orbiter\r\n                                                9/03/76  lander\r\n  Voyager 1           8/20/77  Jupiter          3/05/79  flyby\r\n  Voyager 2           9/05/77  Jupiter          7/09/79  flyby\r\n  Pioneer Venus       5/20/78  Venus           12/04/78  orbiter\r\n                       8/8/78  Venus           12/09/78  probe\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager scan platform contains sophisticated\r\n    instruments that gather data for Voyager’s remote sensing\r\n    investigations.

Science and exploration\r\nhave always gone hand in hand, whether in the transcontinental journey\r\nof Lewis and Clark or the Pacific voyages of Captain James Cook. In this\r\ncentury, as exploration has become more and more dependent on advances\r\nin technology, the scientific element has attained increased prominence.\r\nThe greatest legacy of the NASA Planetary Program is the knowledge it\r\nhas provided of the other worlds that share our corner of the universe.\r\n\r\nDespite the central role of science in motivating missions to the\r\nplanets, specific scientific considerations are not dominant during most\r\nof the development of a mission such as Voyager. The problem of building\r\na spacecraft and getting it to the outer solar system is too demanding.\r\nOf the ton of mass in a Voyager spacecraft, the scientific instruments\r\nmake up only 115 kilograms (about eleven percent). Similarly, the cost\r\nof these instruments amounts to only about 10 percent of the cost of the\r\nspacecraft and launch vehicle. Unless the launch and operation of the\r\nspacecraft are nearly perfect, there can be no scientific return in any\r\ncase; even the most sophisticated package of scientific instruments will\r\nnot tell much about Jupiter if, following launch, it rests at the bottom\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean. But it is equally true that the ultimate purpose\r\nof the mission is scientific discovery, and NASA makes every effort to\r\nensure that the very best instruments are flown and that a broad\r\nscientific community is given the opportunity to participate in each\r\nmission.\r\n\r\nA decade before the 1977 launch, many astronomers and space scientists\r\nbegan their involvement with the Voyager mission through participation\r\nin study groups convened by NASA and by the National Academy of\r\nSciences. They came primarily from universities, but also in significant\r\nnumbers from NASA laboratories, from industry, and from abroad. In 1971\r\nthe Outer Planets Grand Tours mission definition group carried out a\r\none-year final study of the mission that was to become Voyager. A\r\ncompetition was held in 1972 to select the Voyager flight instruments\r\nand science teams, and a third review stage followed a year later to\r\nconfirm this selection. Out of this process emerged eleven science\r\ninvestigations, with which more than one hundred scientists were\r\nassociated. In this chapter we look at the instruments and the persons\r\nwho designed them for this challenging task.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Direct and Remote Measurements\r\n\r\nThe diverse measurements made by Voyager of a planet and its environment\r\ncan be divided into two broad categories, usually called direct or _in\r\nsitu_ measurements and remote sensing measurements. A direct measurement\r\ninvolves the analysis of the immediate environment of the spacecraft;\r\nremote measurements can be made by analyzing radiation from distant\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nThe direct measurement instruments on Voyager measure cosmic ray\r\nparticles, low energy charged particles, magnetic fields, plasma\r\nparticles, and plasma waves. Their activity began immediately after\r\nlaunch, monitoring the Earth environment and then interplanetary space\r\nuntil the magnetosphere of Jupiter was reached a few days before the\r\nactual flyby. Long after the flybys of Jupiter and Saturn are completed,\r\nparticles and fields data can continue to be acquired by the Voyagers as\r\nthey speed outward into previously unexplored regions of space.\r\n\r\nThe remote sensing investigations are essentially astronomical in\r\nnature, measuring the light reflected from or emitted by the planet and\r\nits satellites. On Voyager, however, these instruments far outstrip\r\ntheir terrestrial counterparts in capability. Primarily, they derive\r\ntheir advantage from their proximity to what they observe—at its\r\nclosest, Voyager was more than a thousand times nearer to Jupiter than\r\nare Earth-based telescopes; and for the still closer satellite\r\nencounters, Voyager was nearly ten thousand times nearer than\r\nastronomers on Earth. In addition, Voyager provided perspectives, such\r\nas views of the night side of Jupiter, that are impossible from Earth.\r\nFinally, these instruments could exploit the full spectrum of\r\nelectromagnetic radiation without concern for the opacity of the\r\nterrestrial atmosphere, which restricts ground-based astronomers to\r\ncertain spectral windows and blocks all observation at other\r\nwavelengths.\r\n\r\nFive of the remote sensing instruments—the two TV cameras, the infrared\r\nspectrometer, the ultraviolet spectrometer, and the photopolarimeter—are\r\nmounted together on a scan platform. This platform can be pointed to\r\nalmost any direction in space, allowing exact targeting of the\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nOne remote sensing instrument, the planetary radio astronomy receiver,\r\nis not on the scan platform. It measures long-wave radio emission\r\nwithout requiring special pointing.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The fully deployed Voyager spacecraft is capable of a\r\n    wide variety of direct and remote sensing measurements. The\r\n    instruments and their objectives were selected many years before the\r\n    first Jupiter encounter. Because of the exploratory nature of the\r\n    Voyager mission, every effort was made to fly versatile instruments\r\n    that could yield valuable results no matter what the nature of the\r\n    Jovian system.

[353-2992BC]]\r\n\r\nA final Voyager investigation did not fit into this pattern of direct\r\nversus remote sensing instruments. In fact, it required no special\r\ninstrument at all. This investigation deals with radio science, and it\r\nutilizes the regular communications link between the spacecraft and\r\nEarth to derive the masses of Jupiter and its satellites, to probe the\r\natmosphere of Jupiter, and to study properties of the interplanetary\r\nmedium.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager Imaging Science Team]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Imaging\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Voyager are in its imaging system.

NASA\r\nassigned the development of the cameras directly to JPL, to be\r\nintegrated from the beginning with the design of the Voyager spacecraft\r\nand its subsystems. The members of the Voyager Imaging Science Team were\r\nselected, as individuals, on the basis of the scientific studies they\r\nproposed to carry out. Initially, ten members of the Imaging Science\r\nTeam were selected, but by the time of the Jupiter encounters, the team\r\nhad been expanded to 22 scientists.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Bradford A. Smith, imaging science Team Leader]\r\n\r\nThe Team Leader is Bradford A. Smith, a professor in the Department of\r\nPlanetary Science at the University of Arizona.

He was also active in ground-based photography of Jupiter at\r\nboth New Mexico State University and University of Arizona, and he is a\r\nmember of the team developing a planetary camera for the Space\r\nTelescope, scheduled for operation in Earth orbit in the mid-1980s.\r\n\r\nOriginally, the Deputy Team Leader was Geoffrey A. Briggs, a young\r\nBritish-born physicist from JPL. However, in 1977 Briggs took a position\r\nat NASA Headquarters in Washington and was replaced by geologist\r\nLaurence A. Soderblom of the U.S. Geological Survey in Flagstaff,\r\nArizona. An energetic and articulate scientist, Soderblom, with his\r\ninterest in satellite geology, complemented Smith, whose personal\r\nscientific interests are directed more toward the atmosphere of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of imaging involved multicolor photography of Jupiter and\r\nits satellites. Both wide- and narrow-angle cameras were needed to\r\nobtain the highest possible resolution while retaining the capability to\r\nstudy global-scale features on Jupiter and the satellites. In normal\r\nphotographic terms, both cameras used telephoto lenses. For the\r\nwide-angle camera, a focal length of 200 millimeters was selected,\r\ngiving a field of view of about 3 degrees. This field is similar to that\r\nobtained with a 400-millimeter telephoto lens on a 35-millimeter camera.\r\nThe narrow-angle Voyager camera has a focal length of 1500 millimeters\r\nand field of view of 0.4 degrees. The camera optics are combinations of\r\nmirrors and lenses, designed for extreme stability of focus and for\r\nfreedom from distortion.\r\n\r\nEach camera has a rotating filter wheel that can be used to select the\r\ncolor of the light that reaches the camera. For the wide-angle camera,\r\nthese colors are clear, violet, blue, green, orange, and three special\r\nbands for selective observation in sodium light (589-nanometer\r\nwavelength), and in methane spectral lines at 541 nanometers and 618\r\nnanometers. For the narrow-angle camera, the filters are clear,\r\nultraviolet, violet, blue, green, and orange. To create a color picture,\r\nthe cameras are commanded to take, in rapid succession, pictures of the\r\nsame area in blue, green, and orange light. These three pictures can\r\nthen be reconstructed on Earth into a “true” color image. Other\r\ncombinations of colors are used to investigate particular scientific\r\nproblems and to determine the spectrum of sunlight reflected from\r\nfeatures on Jupiter and its satellites.\r\n\r\nThe detector in the cameras is not photographic film but the surface of\r\na selenium-sulfur vidicon television tube, 11 millimeters square. Unlike\r\nmost commercial TV cameras, these tubes are designed for slow-scan\r\nreadout, providing 48 seconds to acquire each picture. The shutter speed\r\ncan be varied from a fraction of a second (for Jupiter and Io) to many\r\nminutes (for searches for faint features, such as aurorae on the night\r\nside of Jupiter).\r\n\r\nEach picture consists of many numbers, each of which represents the\r\nbrightness of a single picture element, or pixel, on the image. There\r\nare 640 000 pixels in each Voyager image, representing a square image of\r\n800 × 800 points. This information content is more than twice that of an\r\nordinary television picture, which has only 520 lines. For each pixel,\r\neight binary numbers are required to specify the brightness; the total\r\ninformation in a single image is thus 8 × 640 000 = 5 120 000 bits. Even\r\nat a transmission of one frame per 48 seconds, the “bit rate” is more\r\nthan 100 000 bits per second. For comparison, the bit rate from the\r\nfirst spacecraft to Mars (Mariner 4) was about 10 bits per second,\r\nrequiring a week to transmit 21 pictures, with a total information\r\ncontent equivalent to a single Voyager picture. Altogether, Voyager took\r\nnearly 20 000 pictures at each Jupiter encounter, representing 10¹¹—a\r\nhundred billion—bits of information.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rudolph Hanel, infrared spectrometer Principal\r\n    Investigator]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Infrared Spectrometer\r\n\r\nThe infrared investigation on Voyager is based on one of the most\r\nsophisticated instruments ever flown to another planet. In the past,\r\nmost infrared instruments on planetary spacecraft measured at only a few\r\nwavelengths, but Voyager carries a true spectrometer, capable of\r\nmeasuring at nearly 2000 separate wavelengths, covering the spectrum\r\nfrom 4 to 50 micrometers.\r\n\r\nTwelve scientists, led by Principal Investigator Rudolph Hanel of the\r\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Maryland, proposed this\r\ninfrared instrument. Hanel is an acknowledged world leader in infrared\r\nspectroscopy from space. With his co-workers at Goddard, he has\r\npioneered in adapting the extremely complex art of interferometric\r\nspectroscopy to the rigors of space flight. His spectrometers have made\r\nmany studies of the Earth’s atmosphere from meteorological satellites,\r\nand a Hanel interferometer flew successfully to Mars on Mariner 9.\r\n\r\nThe primary goals of the infrared spectrometer investigation are\r\ndirected toward analysis of the composition and structure of the\r\natmosphere of Jupiter. Among the molecules to be searched for on Jupiter\r\nwere hydrogen (H₂), helium (He), methane (CH₄), ammonia (NH₃), phosphine\r\n(PH₃), water (H₂O), carbon monoxide (CO), simple compounds of silicon\r\nand sulfur, and a variety of organic compounds consisting of atoms of\r\ncarbon and hydrogen (e.g., C₂H₂, C₂H₄, C₂H₆). In addition to indicating\r\nthe abundance of these constituents of the atmosphere, the infrared\r\nspectra also contain information on atmospheric structure, that is, on\r\nthe variation of temperature and pressure with altitude. The presence of\r\nclouds or dust layers can also be inferred from the shapes of spectral\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its spectroscopy of Jupiter, the Voyager instrument could\r\nbe used as a heat-measuring device to map the temperatures of both the\r\nsatellites and the atmosphere of Jupiter. Particularly interesting for\r\nthe satellites are measurements of the surface cooling and heating\r\nrates, since these rates reveal the physical compactness of the surface,\r\neasily distinguishing between rock and sand or dust.\r\n\r\nThe infrared instrument is a Michelson interferometer at the focus of a\r\ngold-plated telescope of 51-centimeter aperture. The spectrum is not\r\nobtained directly, by moving a prism or grating, but indirectly through\r\nthe interference effects of light of different wavelengths: hence its\r\nname, an interferometer. The complex interference pattern generated by\r\nthe motion of one of the mirrors in the light path is transmitted to\r\nEarth, where computer analysis is required to transform it into a\r\nrecognizable spectrum. The entire instrument, which has a mass of 20\r\nkilograms, is called IRIS, for infrared interferometer spectrometer.\r\n\r\nThe development of the infrared system for Voyager posed many problems.\r\nIRIS was designed to cover the optimum spectral region for studies of\r\nthe atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. However, when it was decided in\r\n1974 that an extended Voyager mission might also allow a visit to\r\nUranus, Hanel and his colleagues realized that their instrument had\r\nserious deficiencies for investigation of that colder and more distant\r\nplanet, and they proposed that a modified IRIS (MIRIS) be substituted\r\nfor the original design. A crash program was authorized to develop MIRIS\r\nin parallel with IRIS, and in early 1977, as launch approached, it\r\nappeared that the improved instrument would be ready. Problems occurred\r\nduring testing, however, and for several weeks in June and July the\r\ndecision hung in the balance. Unfortunately, there simply was not enough\r\ntime to solve all the problems; both Voyagers were launched carrying the\r\noriginal IRIS, and the final flight qualification of MIRIS came in\r\nOctober, about six weeks after launch. With no other missions planned\r\nbeyond Saturn, no alternate use for MIRIS has been found; it remains “on\r\nthe shelf,” one of the rare cases where a technological gamble by NASA\r\ndid not pay off.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Lyle Broadfoot, ultraviolet spectrometer Principal\r\n    Investigator]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Ultraviolet Spectrometer\r\n\r\nA second spectroscopic instrument on the Voyager scan platform examines\r\nshort-wave, or ultraviolet, radiation. The Principal Investigator for\r\nthe ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) is A. Lyle Broadfoot of Kitt Peak\r\nNational Observatory in Tucson, Arizona. Broadfoot’s expertise lies in\r\ninstrumentation for atmospheric research, and he was previously the\r\nPrincipal Investigator for a similar ultraviolet instrument on the\r\nMariner 10 mission to Venus and Mercury. Associated with Broadfoot in\r\nthe Voyager investigation are fourteen other scientists from the United\r\nStates, Canada, and France.\r\n\r\nIn the upper atmosphere of a planet, the lighter gases tend to diffuse,\r\nrising above their heavier neighbors, and unusual chemical reactions\r\ntake place as the action of sunlight breaks some chemical bonds and\r\nstimulates the formation of others. The study of these tenuous regions\r\nof planetary atmospheres is called aeronomy. Many of the exotic chemical\r\nprocesses that occur can best be studied by examining radiation of very\r\nshort wavelength, and it is to these problems that much of the work of\r\nthe UVS team is directed.\r\n\r\nThe observations are also sensitive to special processes in the Jovian\r\natmosphere resulting from the magnetosphere. At the very top of the\r\natmosphere, energetic charged particles interacting with the atmospheric\r\nmolecules produce ultraviolet aurorae that indicate the location and\r\nnature of the bombarding electrons and ions. Emissions from atoms in the\r\nextended gas clouds around Io and possibly around other satellites were\r\nalso expected to be observable.\r\n\r\nThe ultraviolet instrument is a relatively straightforward optical\r\nspectrometer, adapted for use in space. A diffraction grating disperses\r\nthe light into a spectrum, and the other optical elements are\r\ngold-coated mirrors. The field of view is rectangular, about 0.1 degrees\r\n× 0.9 degrees. An array of sensitive electronic detectors provides\r\nsimultaneous measurements in 128 wavelength channels over a wavelength\r\nrange from 50 to 170 nanometers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Photopolarimeter\r\n\r\nThe fourth scan-platform instrument is designed to measure the\r\nbrightness and polarization of light with high precision. Unlike the\r\nimaging system, however, it can look at only a single point (one pixel)\r\nat a time; thus it sacrifices spatial capability in favor of precision\r\nof measurement. The prime objectives of this photopolarimeter are\r\nrelated to study of the clouds of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nDuring the development stage for this instrument, the Principal\r\nInvestigator was Charles F. Lillie of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and\r\nSpace Physics of the University of Colorado at Boulder. Later, the\r\nPrincipal Investigator’s role was assumed by Lillie’s colleague, Charles\r\nW. Hord, a physicist with considerable experience in space missions,\r\nprimarily with ultraviolet instruments. Four other scientists are\r\nCo-Investigators on the photopolarimeter.\r\n\r\nThe instrument itself is essentially a small Cassegrain reflecting\r\ntelescope of 15-centimeter aperture. Two consecutive filter wheels\r\nselect the color and polarization of the light, which is then detected\r\nand measured by a photomultiplier tube. The entire photopolarimeter\r\nweighs just 2.5 kilograms.\r\n\r\nIn spite of their apparent simplicity, however, the Voyager\r\nphotopolarimeters were plagued with troubles almost from the moment of\r\nlaunch. A succession of mechanical failures on Voyager 1 led to the\r\nsticking first of the polarization wheel and then of the filter wheel.\r\nEven when repeated commands from Earth managed to free the wheels, their\r\nbehavior was erratic. Ultimately an electronic failure also took place,\r\nleading to the reluctant decision to shut down the Voyager 1\r\nphotopolarimeter. On Voyager 2, similar mechanical problems greatly\r\nrestricted the ability of the instrument to carry out its observations.\r\nThe photopolarimeter thus was unable to contribute its share to\r\nunraveling the mysteries of Jupiter and its satellites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Charles W. Hord, photopolarimeter Principal\r\n    Investigator]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: James W. Warwick, planetary radio astronomy Principal\r\n    Investigator]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Planetary Radio Astronomy\r\n\r\nThe final Voyager remote sensing instrument is designed to measure radio\r\nemission from Jupiter and Saturn over a wide range of frequencies. These\r\nemissions, which sound like hiss or static if played through an audio\r\nreceiver, result from interactions of charged particles in the\r\nmagnetospheres and ionospheres of the giant planets. The planetary radio\r\nastronomy (PRA) Principal Investigator is James W. Warwick, an\r\nastronomer in the Department of Astro-Geophysics of the University of\r\nColorado at Boulder. Eleven colleagues from the United States and France\r\nparticipate as Co-Investigators. Warwick has been studying Jupiter\r\nlonger than any other Voyager Principal Investigator. He has monitored\r\nits radio emissions since the 1960s, and he played a central role in the\r\ndiscovery that Io influenced these emissions.\r\n\r\nJupiter emits many kinds of radio radiation, ranging from bland thermal\r\nemission at short (centimeter) wavelengths, to synchrotron emission from\r\nenergetic electrons at intermediate (decimeter) wavelengths, to erratic,\r\nextremely intense bursts at long (meter and decameter) wavelengths. The\r\norigin of these latter, nonthermal emissions constitutes one of the\r\nmajor unsolved problems of the Jovian system, and, more generally, of\r\nthe physics of plasmas. One of the most important advantages of the\r\nVoyager PRA for studying Jovian radio emission lies in its proximity to\r\nJupiter and hence its ability to locate the sources of different kinds\r\nof radio bursts.\r\n\r\nThe PRA instrument consists of an antenna and a radio receiver. The\r\nantenna is made up of two thin metal poles, each 10 meters long,\r\nextended from the spacecraft after launch at an angle of 90 degrees to\r\neach other. These are electrically connected to two receivers of\r\nextremely high sensitivity and broad frequency response: from 1.2\r\nkilohertz to 40.5 megahertz. The PRA can operate in a number of modes,\r\ndepending on the measurements desired. At its lowest level of activity,\r\nit monitors intensity in all 198 bands and transmits the data at 266\r\nbits per second. In its highest mode, where searches are made for\r\nvariations with very short time scales, the data rate goes up to 108 000\r\nbits per second, essentially the same as that required by imaging. In\r\nfact, the high-rate PRA data actually use an imaging frame as a display\r\nform, and occasionally throughout the mission an unfamiliar looking\r\n“image” was transmitted that was actually a block of PRA data—a portrait\r\nof electrical events in the Jovian atmosphere and magnetosphere that\r\nonly Warwick and his colleagues could interpret.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Norman F. Ness, magnetometer Principal Investigator]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager’s 13-meter-long magnetometer boom is shown\r\n    fully extended. In space, under zero gravity conditions, the\r\n    triangular epoxy glass mast spirals from its housing and provides a\r\n    rigid support for two magnetometer instruments—one at the end of the\r\n    boom and another at about the midpoint. [260-181]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Magnetometer\r\n\r\nThe first of the direct sensing instruments to be discussed is the\r\nmagnetometer, designed to measure the magnetic fields surrounding the\r\nspacecraft. Such measurements can be interpreted to yield the intrinsic\r\nfields of Jupiter and its satellites and to characterize, in conjunction\r\nwith data from particle and plasma instruments, the processes taking\r\nplace in the magnetosphere of the planet. The Principal Investigator for\r\nthis instrument is Norman F. Ness of the NASA Goddard Space Flight\r\nCenter. Ness is an intense, competitive scientist with a great deal of\r\nprevious experience in spacecraft magnetometers, primarily on board\r\nEarth satellites. Ness is also the only Voyager Principal Investigator\r\nwho has previous experience at Jupiter; he was Principal Investigator on\r\none of the two magnetometer instruments flown on Pioneer 11. For the\r\nVoyager investigation, Ness is joined by four colleagues from Goddard\r\nand one from Germany.\r\n\r\nThe magnetometer instrument consists of two systems: a high-field\r\nmagnetometer and a low-field magnetometer. Each system contains two\r\nidentical three-axis magnetometers that measure the intensity and\r\ndirection of the magnetic field. The low-field system requires isolation\r\nfrom magnetic fields induced by electric circuits in the spacecraft\r\nitself. To achieve this isolation, it is mounted on the largest\r\ncomponent of Voyager—a 13-meter boom, about as long as the width of a\r\ntypical city house lot. This boom was coiled tightly in a canister\r\nduring launch; later, when the package was opened, it uncurled and\r\nextended automatically.\r\n\r\nBy using two magnetometers, Ness and his colleagues are able to correct\r\nfor the residual artificial magnetic fields that reach even 13 meters\r\nfrom the main spacecraft. The dynamic range extends from a maximum field\r\nof 20 gauss down to 2 × 10⁻⁸ gauss—a factor of one billion. The fields\r\ncan be measured as frequently as 17 times per second. The total mass,\r\nexclusive of the 13-meter boom, is 5.6 kilograms.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Herbert S. Bridge, plasma particle Principal\r\n    Investigator]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Plasma Particles\r\n\r\nPlasma is the term given to a “gas” of charged particles; the electrons\r\nand protons are separate, yet there are equal numbers of each, producing\r\na zero net charge. If the velocities of the electrons and protons are\r\nless than about 0.1 percent of the speed of light, they can be measured\r\nby the Voyager plasma instrument; if their energies are higher, they are\r\nmeasured by one of the other two particle instruments—the low energy\r\ncharged particle (LECP) detector or the cosmic ray detector. The plasma\r\ninstrument, like the magnetometer, was designed to provide basic data on\r\nthe particles and fields environment of Voyager.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator for the plasma instrument is Herbert S.\r\nBridge of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,\r\nMassachusetts. An experienced space physicist, Bridge has flown similar\r\ninstruments on many Earth satellites and planetary probes. He also holds\r\nthe position of Director of the Laboratory for Space Experiments at MIT.\r\nOn the Voyager experiment, he is joined by one German and ten U.S.\r\nCo-Investigators.\r\n\r\nThe objectives of the plasma investigation are directed toward study of\r\nboth the interplanetary medium and the Jovian magnetosphere. At Jupiter,\r\nBridge expected to determine the plasma populations and processes in the\r\ninner and outer regions of the magnetosphere and in the plasma tail that\r\nextends beyond Jupiter, much as a comet tail is blown outward by the\r\nsolar wind. The densities and temperature of electrons were measured,\r\nand their origins determined: Some originate near Jupiter and diffuse\r\noutward through the magnetosphere; others derive from the solar wind.\r\n\r\nThe plasma instrument, with a mass of 9.9 kilograms, was designed to\r\nview in two directions: one toward the Earth and Sun, primarily to study\r\nthe solar wind, and the other sideways, looking toward the direction\r\nplasma would flow if it were caught up in the rotating Jovian magnetic\r\nfield. If it is desired to look in other directions, the entire\r\nspacecraft must be tipped, a maneuver that was carried out several times\r\nnear Jupiter. The detectors directly sense the flow of electrons,\r\nprotons, and alpha particles (helium nucleii, made up of two protons and\r\ntwo neutrons each). Analysis of the energy spectra can also yield data\r\non positive ions of higher mass.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Frederick L. Scarf, plasma wave Principal\r\n    Investigator]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Plasma Waves\r\n\r\nThe plasma wave investigation on Voyager was a late addition to the\r\nscientific payload. It was selected to broaden the capability of the\r\nmission to study a wide variety of plasma processes. Because of the\r\nelectrically charged nature of the plasma, it responds to energy inputs\r\nin ways that ordinary gas cannot. One of these modes of response yields\r\nplasma waves, which are oscillations in density and electric field that\r\ngenerally cover the audio range of frequencies. Measurement of such\r\nwaves characterizes the density and temperature of the local plasma\r\nsurrounding the spacecraft, and it also allows remote sensing detection\r\nof distant events from the plasma waves they produce.\r\n\r\nThe plasma wave Principal Investigator is physicist Frederick L. Scarf\r\nof the TRW Defense and Space Systems Group of Redondo Beach,\r\nCalifornia—he is the only Voyager Principal Investigator to come from\r\nindustry. Scarf has been associated with many particles and fields\r\ninvestigations in the terrestrial magnetosphere, although he is better\r\nknown as a theorist than as an experimenter. A member of the Space\r\nScience Board of the National Academy of Sciences, he is familiar in\r\nWashington as an eloquent advocate of space physics—the study of\r\nplasma-physical processes in the space environment.\r\n\r\nThe plasma wave instrument shares with the planetary radio astronomy\r\ninvestigation a pair of 10-meter-long antennas. Whereas the PRA uses\r\nthese as electric antennas to detect radio radiation, the plasma wave\r\nsystem uses them to detect directly the oscillations in the plasma near\r\nthe spacecraft. Waves are measured over a broad frequency range, from 10\r\nhertz (a bit deeper than the lowest bass note we can hear) to 56\r\nkilohertz (about three times higher than the highest pitch to which the\r\nhuman ear responds). The instrument electronics have a total mass of\r\nonly 1.4 kilograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Low Energy Charged Particles\r\n\r\nCharged particles with energies greater than a few thousand electron\r\nvolts are not easily measured by a plasma instrument such as that\r\ndesigned by Herb Bridge. Instead, these faster moving particles, with\r\nspeeds up to a few percent the speed of light, are the subject of a pair\r\nof Voyager instruments called collectively the LECP, or low energy\r\ncharged particle instrument. Like the other particles and fields\r\ninvestigation, the LECP is designed to provide basic data on\r\nplasma-physical processes in the Jovian magnetosphere and the solar\r\nwind, and on their interactions.\r\n\r\nThe Principal Investigator for the LECP investigation is Stamatios Mike\r\nKrimigis, a Greek-born physicist from Johns Hopkins University. Krimigis\r\nhas participated in a number of satellite studies of the terrestrial\r\nmagnetosphere, and he now serves as Head of Space Physics and\r\nInstrumentation at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory. He is\r\njoined in this investigation by one German and five U.S.\r\nCo-Investigators.\r\n\r\nThe LECP instrument consists of two subsystems. The first, called the\r\nlow energy magnetospheric particle analyzer, is optimized for\r\nmeasurement of particles within the Jovian magnetosphere, with high\r\nsensitivity over a broad dynamic range. Measurements of electrons,\r\nprotons, and other positive ions can be carried out, determining the\r\nenergy and composition of individual particles. The total energy ranges\r\ncovered are 10 kiloelectron volts (keV) to 11 million electron volts\r\n(MeV) for electrons and 15 keV to 150 MeV for protons and ions.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Stamatios Mike Krimigis, low energy charged particle\r\n    Principal Investigator]\r\n\r\nThe second LECP subsystem is a low energy charged particle telescope,\r\ndesigned to operate where the density of charged particles is low, such\r\nas in interplanetary space or the outer magnetosphere of Jupiter. For\r\nprotons and positive ions, the energy range is from 50 keV to 40 MeV per\r\nnucleon. The energy and species resolution is again sufficient to\r\ndetermine the composition, both chemical and isotopic, of many ions\r\nencountered. In order to provide directional discrimination even on a\r\nspacecraft of fixed orientation, both LECP subsystems are mounted on a\r\nmoving platform that steps through eight positions in a time that can be\r\ncommanded to vary from 48 seconds to 48 minutes. The mass of the\r\ninstrument and its platform is 6.7 kilograms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Cosmic Rays\r\n\r\nThe solar system is constantly bombarded by extremely energetic charged\r\nparticles. These are called cosmic rays, although they are particles,\r\nnot photons—“rays” are only produced when the particles strike\r\nsomething, such as the molecules of the Earth’s atmosphere, and give up\r\ntheir energy in a flash of x-rays and gamma-rays. One of the Voyager\r\ninstruments is designed to study these galactic cosmic rays,\r\nparticularly to look from beyond the orbit of Saturn, where the cosmic\r\nray particles will be less affected by the solar magnetic field and\r\nsolar wind than they are near Earth.\r\n\r\nThe cosmic ray Principal Investigator is Rochus E. Vogt of the\r\nCalifornia Institute of Technology. Vogt has measured cosmic rays from\r\nthe ground, from balloons, and from spacecraft for many years. During\r\n1977 and 1978 he served as Chief Scientist at JPL, and then assumed the\r\njob of directing the physics, mathematics, and astronomy programs at\r\nCaltech. Among his six Co-Investigators is Ed Stone, the Voyager Project\r\nScientist.\r\n\r\nBecause the cosmic ray instrument was not directed principally toward\r\nmeasurements of the Jovian system, it is described only briefly. Like\r\nthe LECP, it is designed to determine the energy and composition of\r\nindividual electrons and positive ions. For electrons, the energy range\r\nis from 3 to 110 MeV, and for ions from 1 to 500 MeV per nucleon; the\r\ncorresponding velocities are from about 10 percent to 99 percent of the\r\nspeed of light. For the positive ions, composition can be determined for\r\nelements from hydrogen to iron. At Jupiter, this system could be used to\r\ndetermine the nature of the rare particles accelerated to very high\r\nenergies in the Jovian magnetosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Radio Science\r\n\r\nThe final Voyager science investigation is in the field of radio\r\nscience. No special instrument was required for this study; rather, NASA\r\nselected members of a Radio Science Team who proposed investigations\r\nthat could be carried out using the already existing spacecraft\r\ntelecommunication system.\r\n\r\nThe radio science Team Leader is Von R. Eshleman of the Center for Radio\r\nAstronomy at Stanford University. Eshleman is a radar physicist who has\r\nbeen interpreting spacecraft radio occultation data since the first such\r\nprobe was carried out when Mariner 4 passed behind Mars in 1964. The\r\nDeputy Team Leader is G. Leonard Tyler, a colleague of Eshleman’s at\r\nStanford. There are five other radio team members, four of them from\r\nJPL.\r\n\r\nThe radio science investigations are divided into two groups. The first\r\ndeals with the atmosphere of Jupiter. During the Voyager flybys, the\r\nspacecraft passed behind the planet as seen from Earth, and the radio\r\nsignal was dimmed by the atmosphere before it was finally extinguished.\r\nDuring an occultation, the propagation of the radio waves is slowed down\r\nby passage through the neutral atmosphere and is speeded up by passage\r\nthrough the electrically charged ionosphere. Because of the extreme\r\nstability of the ground-based and spacecraft radio transmitters, it is\r\npossible to measure these shifts in the signal with high precision. The\r\nshifts are proportional to electron density for the ionosphere, and to\r\ngas density for the atmosphere. From a careful study of the interactions\r\nof the transmitted beam with the Jovian atmosphere, Eshleman and his\r\ncolleagues can reconstruct a temperature-pressure profile of the\r\nionosphere and the upper atmosphere of Jupiter. The same approach can be\r\nused to search for tenuous atmospheres on the satellites.\r\n\r\nThe second area of study is in the field of celestial mechanics. The\r\nfrequency stability of the communications system permits measurements of\r\nthe speed of the spacecraft, relative to Earth, to a precision of one\r\npart in several million. By careful tracking, gravitational\r\nperturbations on the spacecraft can be detected and used to measure the\r\ngravitational fields, and hence the masses, of Jupiter and its\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Rochus E. Vogt, cosmic ray Principal Investigator]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Von R. Eshleman, radio science Team Leader]\r\n\r\nThese scientific instruments and their objectives were selected many\r\nyears before the first Jupiter encounter in March 1977. Because Voyager\r\nwas an exploratory mission, every effort was made to fly versatile\r\ninstruments that could yield valuable results no matter what the nature\r\nof the Jovian system. In addition, the Voyager spacecraft control system\r\npermitted the instruments to receive commands from Earth to adjust their\r\nsensitivities and observing sequences in response to new information. By\r\nthe spring of 1977, all the instruments were completed, ready to be\r\ninstalled in the Voyager spacecraft for testing and launch.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The first picture to capture crescent Earth and\r\n    crescent Moon in the same frame was taken by Voyager 1, the\r\n    second-launched spacecraft, on September 18, 1977, at a distance of\r\n    12 million kilometers from Earth.

It was the last time such a launch vehicle\r\nwas scheduled to be used, as, according to plan, the Space Shuttle would\r\ntake over in the 1980s. Thus the launching of the two Voyagers signified\r\nboth an end and a beginning: a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to\r\nexplore, in only 8½ years’ time, perhaps fifteen major bodies of the\r\nouter solar system.\r\n\r\nBut long before even the first Voyager was to make its closest approach\r\nto Jupiter—in fact, even before Voyager 2 was off the launch pad—there\r\nwere problems to overcome.\r\n\r\nIn early August 1977, about three weeks before launch, failures in the\r\nattitude and articulation control subsystem (AACS) and the flight data\r\nsubsystem (FDS), two of the spacecraft’s three main computer subsystems,\r\nprevented the VGR77-2 spacecraft, originally scheduled for launch on\r\nAugust 20, from becoming Voyager 2. Instead, the “spare” spacecraft\r\nVGR77-3 was substituted, becoming Voyager 2 upon launch August 20, and\r\nVGR77-2, after proper repairs, became Voyager 1. Minor problems\r\ncontinued right up to launch. The low energy charged particle instrument\r\nfailed and had to be replaced, and as late as T minus five minutes there\r\nwas a halt in the countdown to check on a stuck valve. Unlike a jinxed\r\ndress rehearsal, which is said to “assure” an opening-night success,\r\nVoyager 2’s prelaunch problems were a portent of difficulties to come.\r\n\r\nThe Voyager 2 launch was witnessed by thousands as the spacecraft\r\nascended gracefully into the blue Florida sky, accompanied by the\r\ndeep-throated rumblings of its rocket, echoing for miles across the\r\nbeaches and scrub forests of Cape Canaveral. The Titan-Centaur\r\nperformance was nearly flawless, and Voyager 2 quickly achieved an\r\naccurate trajectory toward Jupiter. However, even while the engines were\r\nstill firing, the spacecraft began to experience a baffling series of\r\nproblems that would absorb the attention of hundreds of persons from\r\nPasadena to Washington, D.C., for the next several weeks until they were\r\nbrought under control.\r\n\r\nDuring the first minutes of flight, there seemed to be two difficulties\r\nwith the AACS. The first was a problem with one of the three stabilizing\r\ngyroscopes, but fortunately, the gyroscope began operating normally\r\nwithout intervention from the ground. The other problem appeared to be\r\nwith one of the AACS computers; the spacecraft switched to a backup\r\ncomputer during the Titan burn, and initial data transmissions were\r\nincomplete. Early analysis seemed to indicate that an event during the\r\nlaunch itself, rather than a faulty spacecraft computer system, was the\r\ncause of the data loss. At first, on August 23, officials suspected that\r\nperhaps the spacecraft had been bumped by the rocket motor one hour\r\nafter liftoff and again about seventeen hours later, when telemetry\r\nsignals indicated that the spacecraft had been jolted. However, by the\r\nnext day, flight engineers determined that electronic gyrations in the\r\nAACS seemed to have caused the difficulty.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Titan-Centaur rocket used to launch Voyager stood\r\n    as tall as a 15-story building and weighed nearly 700 tons. Here the\r\n    rocket waits for launch at Kennedy Space Center, with the Voyager\r\n    spacecraft enclosed in the white protective shroud at the top.\r\n    [P-19471A]]\r\n\r\nWithin an hour after launch, Voyager 2’s science scan platform boom was\r\nto have been fully extended and locked. Instructions to deploy were\r\ngiven, and the boom moved outward; however, there was no signal to\r\nindicate that the boom was actually locked in place. Efforts to command\r\nthe boom to move into the locked position were thwarted by the\r\nspacecraft. The first maneuver designed to try to lock the boom was\r\naborted by the computer command subsystem (CCS) when the AACS\r\nerroneously indicated that it was in trouble. Three days later another\r\nmaneuver was scheduled to reprogram the faulty computer in the AACS, to\r\nalign the Sun sensors, and to try to lock the science boom. To provide a\r\ndirect check of the boom position, the scan platform was turned so that\r\nthe TV cameras could see the spacecraft. Careful measurement of these\r\npictures verified that the boom was within ½ degree of full deployment,\r\nbut still there was no indication that it was locked into place.\r\nUltimately, it was decided that the sensor to signal actuation of the\r\nlock was at fault, and that the boom itself was almost certainly fully\r\nextended and operational.\r\n\r\nBecause of the postlaunch problems of Voyager 2, the launch of Voyager 1\r\nwas delayed twice—from September 1 to September 3 and then to September\r\n5—in order to inspect Voyager 1’s science boom and to try to prevent a\r\nrepetition of Voyager 2’s problems. An extra spring was attached to the\r\nscience boom to assure its full extension. Finally, as if to make up for\r\nthe troubles of the first launch, Voyager 1’s launch was both “flawless\r\nand accurate.” All launch and postlaunch events went smoothly. The\r\nlaunch window opened at 8:56 a.m. EDT, and Voyager took off promptly at\r\n8:56:01. The booms and antennas deployed and locked in the first hours\r\nafter launch; all instruments scheduled to be on were on and working\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE TITAN/CENTAUR LAUNCH VEHICLE\r\n\r\nThe two Voyager spacecraft were carried into space and accelerated\r\ntoward Jupiter by the Titan III-E Centaur rocket, the largest launch\r\nvehicle in the NASA arsenal after the retirement of the Saturn rockets\r\nin 1975. The Titan and Centaur vehicles were originally developed\r\nseparately and have been used with other rocket stages for many NASA\r\nlaunches. They were first combined for the two Viking launches to Mars\r\nin 1975, and this powerful four-stage launch vehicle was used again in\r\n1977 for Voyager.\r\n\r\nThe Titan/Centaur stands nearly 50 meters tall, about the height of a\r\nfifteen-story building. Fully fueled, it weighs nearly 700 tons. At\r\ntakeoff, the thrust of the two solid-propellant Stage-0 motors is about\r\n10.7 million newtons. These motors, which burn for 122 seconds, use\r\npowdered aluminum as fuel and ammonium perchlorate as oxidizer.\r\nTogether, they have a mass of 500 tons.\r\n\r\nThe first stage of the liquid propellant core of the Titan rocket\r\nignites about 112 seconds after takeoff. The propellant is hydrazine as\r\nfuel and nitrogen tetroxide as oxidizer. The first stage is 3 meters in\r\ndiameter and 20 meters tall. Fueled, it has a mass of 130 tons. The\r\nmotor provides a thrust of 2.5 million newtons for a duration of 146\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nAbout 4.3 minutes after takeoff the Titan Stage II liquid propellant\r\nmotor begins to fire, and the first stage is separated and falls back\r\ninto the Atlantic. The second stage is 3 meters in diameter and more\r\nthan 7 meters long, with a fueled mass of 35 tons. The single liquid\r\nfuel motor burns for 210 seconds with a thrust of half a million\r\nnewtons. During the second stage burn, the shroud covering the Voyager\r\nspacecraft is jettisoned.\r\n\r\nThe Centaur and Titan vehicles separate 8 minutes into the flight, and\r\nthe Centaur main engine begins its burn. The Centaur is nearly 20 meters\r\ntall and 3 meters in diameter, with a mass of 17 tons. The motors have a\r\nthrust of almost 200 000 newtons, operating on the most powerful\r\nchemical fuels known: liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. The Centaur\r\nburns for only 1 minute and 36 seconds as it attains Earth parking\r\norbit; the engine then shuts down as the vehicle begins a half-hour\r\ncoasting period that carries it nearly half way around the Earth. During\r\nthis time, careful tracking of the spacecraft supplies the data needed\r\nfor Earth-based computers to calculate the proper time to leave parking\r\norbit and start the long trip toward Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAbout 50 minutes after liftoff, from a position high above the Indian\r\nOcean, the second burn of the Centaur main engine begins. Six minutes of\r\nadditional thrust provides enough energy to break out of Earth’s orbit.\r\nThe Voyager then separates from the Centaur for a final boost toward\r\nJupiter. The solid rocket motor in the spacecraft propulsion module\r\n(acting as final stage of this five-stage launch sequence) fires for 45\r\nseconds at a thrust of 68 000 newtons. Just an hour after liftoff, the\r\nVoyager spacecraft is on its way, coasting on an orbit toward Jupiter at\r\na speed of more than 10 kilometers per second.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager spacecraft is dominated by the large\r\n    3.7-meter-diameter antenna used for communication with Earth. Here\r\n    the spacecraft undergoes final tests before launch. The science\r\n    instrument scan platform is folded against the spacecraft on the\r\n    right; the three cylinders on the left are the RTG power sources.\r\n    [260-108BC]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager 2 was the first of the spacecraft to be\r\n    launched, on August 20, 1977, propelled into space in a\r\n    Titan/Centaur rocket. [P-19450AC]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The First Year Is the Roughest\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn of 1977 Voyager 2, and to a lesser extent Voyager 1,\r\ncontinued to plague controllers with erratic actions. Thrusters fired at\r\ninappropriate times, data modes shifted, instrument filter and analyzer\r\nwheels became stuck, and the various computer control systems\r\noccasionally overrode ground commands. Apparently, the spacecraft\r\nhardware was working properly, but the computers on board displayed\r\ncertain traits that seemed almost humanly perverse—and perhaps a little\r\npsychotic. In general, these reactions were the result of programming\r\ntoo much sensitivity into the spacecraft systems, resulting in panic\r\nover-reaction by the onboard computers to minor fluctuations in the\r\nenvironment. Ultimately, part of the programming had to be rewritten on\r\nEarth and then transmitted to the Voyagers, to calm them down so that\r\nthey would ignore minor perturbations, yet still be ready to perform\r\nautomatic sequences required to protect the spacecraft from major\r\nthreats. Meanwhile, however, more serious problems were developing.\r\n\r\nOn February 23, 1978, during a series of movements or slews, Voyager 1’s\r\nscan platform slowed and stopped before completing the maneuver. This\r\nfailure caused a great deal of concern, since the scan platform houses\r\nthe optical instruments that are crucial to the observation of the\r\nJovian system—the ultraviolet spectrometer, the IRIS, the\r\nphotopolarimeter, and the two TV cameras. At JPL, tests were run on a\r\nproof-test model—an exact copy of the Voyager spacecraft—to try to find\r\nout why Voyager 1’s scan platform had become stuck. On March 17, Voyager\r\n1’s scan platform was tested—JPL engineers instructed the platform to\r\nmove slowly for a short distance, and Voyager responded as ordered.\r\nFurther tests were conducted on March 23. This time the scan platform\r\nwas ordered to execute a sequence of four slews, moving away from the\r\npart of the sky where the original failure had occurred and ending with\r\nthe position that it would be most useful to leave the platform in—just\r\nin case the platform should become stuck again. On April 4 the scan\r\nplatform was commanded to perform a sequence of 38 slews, and fifty more\r\nslews were performed on April 5. All were successful. Yet engineers were\r\nstill hesitant to force the platform to move through the region where it\r\nhad originally stuck, and extensive discussions were held to determine\r\nif the Jupiter observations could be carried out without risking a\r\nreturn to the danger area. It was argued, however, that full mobility of\r\nthe scan platform really was required, and on May 31 commands were sent\r\nto maneuver the scan platform through the danger region. It moved\r\nnormally: The scan platform was operating properly again. After\r\nadditional slewing tests were run in mid-June, the scan platform was\r\npronounced fit for operation. Engineers suspected that the material\r\ncaught in the platform gears must have been crushed or moved out of the\r\nway by the continued slewing, allowing the platform to move once more.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager 1 was launched on September 5, 1977. The\r\n    launch was delayed 5 days to make last-minute adjustments to avoid\r\n    the postlaunch difficulties experienced by Voyager 2. [P-19480AC]]\r\n\r\nAn even more serious crisis soon endangered the Voyager 2 spacecraft. In\r\nlate November 1977, the S-band radio receiver began losing amplifier\r\npower in its high-gain mode, so the solid-state amplifier was switched\r\nto its low-power position. No further problems were noted until April 5,\r\n1978, when Voyager 2’s primary radio receiver suddenly failed, and\r\nshocked engineers discovered that the backup receiver was also faulty.\r\nThe trouble was detected after Voyager’s computer command subsystem\r\ndirected the spacecraft to switch from the primary radio receiver to the\r\nbackup receiver. This command was issued as part of a special protection\r\nsequence: If the primary radio receiver receives no commands from Earth\r\nfor seven days, the backup receiver is switched on instead; if the\r\nsecondary receiver in turn receives no instructions over a twelve-hour\r\nperiod, the system reverts to the main receiver. When, on April 5,\r\nVoyager 2’s radio reception was switched from the primary to the\r\nsecondary receiver, flight engineers found that they were unable to\r\ncommunicate with the spacecraft—the secondary receiver’s tracking loop\r\ncapacitor was malfunctioning. That meant that the secondary receiver\r\ncould not follow a changing signal frequency sent out from Earth. The\r\nfrequencies of signals transmitted from Earth are affected by the\r\nDoppler effect—just as the siren on a fire engine seems first to rise in\r\npitch as the truck approaches, then falls as the truck speeds away, so\r\nthe frequency of signals transmitted from Earth fluctuates with the\r\nEarth’s rotation as the Deep Space Network’s radio antennas move toward\r\nor away from the spacecraft. The engineers had to wait until the primary\r\nradio receiver was switched back on before they could communicate with\r\nthe spacecraft. Once the primary receiver was on, Voyager 2 began\r\nreceiving instructions from Earth, but approximately thirty minutes\r\nlater, there was an apparent power surge in the receiver. The fuses\r\nblew. There was no recourse. The main receiver had failed; its loss was\r\npermanent. It remained for the engineers to devise a way to communicate\r\nwith the slightly deaf spacecraft.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Each Voyager spacecraft follows a billion-kilometer\r\n    path to Jupiter. Except for minor thruster firings to achieve small\r\n    trajectory corrections, each Voyager coasts from Earth to Jupiter,\r\n    guided by the gravitational pull of the Sun. At Jupiter, the\r\n    powerful tug of the giant planet deflects the spacecraft and speeds\r\n    them up, imparting an extra kick to send them on their way toward\r\n    Saturn.]\r\n\r\n  Voyager 1\r\n  Voyager 2\r\n      Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus\r\n    Sun\r\n    Earth 8/20/77\r\n    Earth 9/1/77\r\n    Mars 8/20/77\r\n    Jupiter 8/20/77\r\n    Jupiter 3/5/79\r\n    Jupiter 7/9/79\r\n    Saturn 8/20/77\r\n    Saturn 11/13/80\r\n    Saturn 8/27/81\r\n    Uranus 8/20/77\r\n    Uranus 1/30/86\r\n\r\nBecause the switching of the radio receivers was still controlled by the\r\nspecial protection sequence discussed earlier, flight engineers would\r\nhave to wait for seven days—until April 13—before they could attempt\r\ncommunication with the spacecraft again. During that week special\r\nprocedures were established and rehearsed so that commands could be sent\r\nto Voyager in the short time that the backup receiver would be on. On\r\nThursday, April 13, 1978, the seven days were up and the spacecraft\r\nshould have shifted from the dead main receiver to the sick backup\r\nsystem. There was just a twelve-hour “window” in which to restore\r\ncommunication. At about 3:30 a.m. PST the Madrid tracking station of the\r\nDeep Space Network sent its first order to the spacecraft, approximately\r\n474 million kilometers away. Almost an hour later, word arrived from\r\nVoyager that the command had been accepted. (One-way light time for a\r\nsignal to travel the distance from Earth to Voyager at that time was\r\nalmost 27 minutes.) Elated flight controllers went ahead and transmitted\r\nnine hours of commands to the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nVoyager 2 was successfully commanded again on April 18 and April 26. The\r\nApril 26 commands included a course change maneuver that was executed\r\nproperly on May 3. On June 23, Voyager 2 was programmed for a backup\r\nautomatic mission at Saturn in the event that the secondary radio\r\nreceiver should also fail. These backup mission instructions would\r\noperate all the science experiments, but only a minimum amount of data\r\nwould be returned, since the scan platform would only be programmed to\r\nmove through three positions rather than thousands as it would in normal\r\noperation. Instructions for a backup minimum automatic encounter at\r\nJupiter were transmitted to Voyager 2 in two segments, the second of\r\nthese on October 12, 1978.\r\n\r\nWith the backup instructions recorded on board the spacecraft, Voyager\r\npersonnel felt their fears partially allayed. If Voyager 2’s secondary\r\nradio receiver failed, the spacecraft would still obtain some science\r\ndata at Jupiter and Saturn. But that would mean that there would be no\r\nmission beyond Saturn; our first opportunity to explore Uranus, its\r\nsatellites, its newly discovered ring system, and possibly even to get a\r\nlook at Neptune, would not come in this century.\r\n\r\nAnother major concern affecting both Voyager spacecraft was the proper\r\nmanagement of hydrazine fuel reserves. Hydrazine is used by the\r\nthrusters on the Voyagers for stabilization of the spacecraft and for\r\ntrajectory correction maneuvers (TCM). Each Voyager was loaded with 105\r\nkilograms of hydrazine budgeted for use on the long flight to Jupiter,\r\nSaturn, and beyond. Because of the excellent performance of the launch\r\nrockets, both Voyagers required less hydrazine than anticipated for\r\ntheir final boost into proper trajectory toward Jupiter, and at first it\r\nlooked as though both spacecraft would have plenty of propellant to\r\nspare.\r\n\r\nCharles E. Kolhase, Manager of Mission Analysis and Engineering for the\r\nVoyager Project, later explained the situation: “Voyager 1 should have\r\nbeen launched September 1. Had it been launched on September 1—and I’m\r\nglad it wasn’t—the maneuver to correct the trajectory for a Titan flyby\r\nwould have required a change in velocity of 100-110 meters per second—an\r\nenormous maneuver—and we would have had a propellant margin for going on\r\nto Saturn of perhaps 4.5 kilograms. But, by launching on the fifth of\r\nSeptember we increased our margin to 23 kilograms. Fortunately, for\r\nevery launch date that went by, that velocity change maneuver was\r\nshrinking at a rate of 10 meters per second per day. Now, a 1 meter per\r\nsecond change uses about a pound of hydrazine [about 0.5 kilogram]. So\r\nwhen we launched on the fifth of September, now we suddenly had 40\r\npounds of hydrazine excess over what we would have had if we had\r\nlaunched on the first of September. As a result, Voyager 1 is in great\r\nshape as far as hydrazine is concerned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE DEEP SPACE NETWORK\r\n\r\nA vital component of the Voyager Mission is the communications system\r\nlinking the spacecraft with controllers and scientists on Earth. The\r\nability to communicate with spacecraft over the vast distances to the\r\nouter planets, and particularly to return the enormous amounts of data\r\ncollected by sophisticated cameras and spectrometers, depends in large\r\npart on the transmitters and receivers of the Deep Space Network (DSN),\r\noperated for NASA by JPL.\r\n\r\nThe original network of these receiving stations was established in 1958\r\nto provide round-the-world tracking of the first U.S. satellite,\r\nExplorer 1. By the late 1970s, the DSN had evolved into a system of\r\nlarge antennas, low-noise receivers, and high-power transmitters at\r\nsites strategically located on three continents. From these sites the\r\ndata are forwarded (often using terrestrial communications satellites)\r\nto the mission operations center at JPL.\r\n\r\nThe three DSN stations are located in the Mohave desert at Goldstone,\r\nCalifornia; near Madrid, Spain; and near Canberra, Australia. Each\r\nlocation is equipped with two 26-meter steerable antennas and a single\r\ngiant steerable dish 64 meters in diameter, with approximately the\r\ncollecting area of a football field. In addition, each is equipped with\r\ntransmitting, receiving, and data handling equipment. The transmitters\r\nin Spain and Australia have 100-kilowatt power, while the 64-meter\r\nantenna at Goldstone has a 400-kilowatt transmitter. Most commands to\r\nVoyager are sent from Goldstone, but all three stations require the\r\nhighest quality receivers to permit continuous recording of the data\r\nstreams pouring in from the spacecraft.\r\n\r\nSince the mid-1960s, the DSN’s standard frequency has been S-band (2295\r\nmegahertz). Voyager introduces a new, higher frequency telemetry link at\r\nX-band (8418 megahertz). The X-band signal can carry more information\r\nthan S-band with similar power transmitters, but it requires more exact\r\nantenna performance. In addition, the X-band signal is absorbed by\r\nterrestrial clouds and, especially, rain. Fortunately, all three DSN\r\nstations are in dry climates, but during encounters the weather\r\nforecasts on Earth become items of crucial concern if precious data are\r\nnot to be lost by storm interference.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the development of larger antennas and improved\r\nelectronics, the DSN command capabilities and telemetry data rates have\r\nincreased dramatically over the years. For example, in 1965 Mariner 4\r\ntransmitted from Mars at a rate of only 8⅓ bits of information per\r\nsecond. In 1969, Mariners 6 and 7 transmitted picture data from Mars at\r\n16 200 bits per second. Mariner 10, in 1973, achieved 117 200 bits per\r\nsecond from Mercury. Voyager operates at a similar rate from Jupiter,\r\nabout six times farther away. Many of these improvements in data\r\ntransmission result from changes in the DSN rather than in the\r\nspacecraft transmitters.\r\n\r\nProblems with hydrazine management developed, however. Voyager 1’s first\r\ntrajectory correction maneuver achieved only 80 percent of the required\r\nspeed change. Exhaust plumes from the thrusters apparently struck part\r\nof the spacecraft, causing a 20 percent loss in velocity. That being the\r\ncase, Voyager might require more fuel than had been expected to complete\r\nthe mission. The extra fuel requirements did not threaten Voyager 1\r\nitself, since it held ample fuel to reach Saturn; the concern was for\r\nVoyager 2, where the effective loss of fuel might be enough to\r\njeopardize the Uranus mission.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Project members.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Project members.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the plume impingement problem on Voyager 1, Voyager 2’s first\r\ntrajectory correction maneuver was adjusted to allow for the possibility\r\nof a 20 percent loss in thrust. The Voyager 2 maneuver was successful,\r\nbut controllers felt that additional action was required to conserve\r\nfuel. One way to save was by reducing requirements on control of the\r\nspacecraft orientation. Less control fuel would be needed if the already\r\nminiscule pressure exerted on the spacecraft by the solar wind could be\r\nreduced. Flight engineers at JPL calculated that the pressure would be\r\nreduced if the spacecraft were tipped upside down; however, to\r\naccomplish this, the spacecraft would have to be steered by a new set of\r\nguide stars. By reprogramming the attitude control system it was found\r\npossible to substitute the northern star, Deneb, in the constellation of\r\nCygnus, for the original reference star, Canopus, in the southern\r\nconstellation of Carina. With this change, as well as readjustment of\r\nVoyager 2’s trajectory near Jupiter, inflight consumption of hydrazine\r\nwas reduced significantly.\r\n\r\nIn late August 1978 both Voyagers were reprogrammed to ensure better\r\nscience results at Jupiter encounter; for example, the reprogramming\r\nwould prevent imaging (TV) photographs from blurring when the tape\r\nrecorder was operating. By early November, flight crews had begun\r\ntraining exercises to rehearse for the Voyager 1 flyby of Jupiter on\r\nMarch 5, 1979. A near encounter test was performed on December 12-14,\r\n1978: a complete runthrough of Voyager 1’s 39-hour near encounter\r\nperiod, which would take place March 3-5, 1979. Participants included\r\nthe flight team, the Deep Space Network tracking stations, the\r\nscientists, and the spacecraft itself. Results: Voyager and the Voyager\r\nteam were all ready for the encounter.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the spacecraft were busy returning scientific data to Earth.\r\nTechnically, the Voyagers were in the cruise phase of the mission—a\r\nperiod that, for Voyager 2, would last until April 24, 1979, and for\r\nVoyager 1, until January 4, 1979, when each spacecraft would enter its\r\nrespective observatory phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Cruise Phase Science\r\n\r\nIn the first few days after launch, the spacecrafts’ instruments were\r\nturned on and calibrated; various tests for each instrument would\r\ncontinue to be performed throughout the cruise phase. This period\r\npresented a great opportunity for the Voyagers to study the\r\ninterplanetary magnetic fields, solar flares, and the solar wind. In\r\naddition, ultraviolet and infrared radiation studies of the sky were\r\nperformed. In mid-September 1977 the television cameras on Voyager 1\r\nrecorded a number of photographs of the Earth and Moon. A photograph\r\ntaken September 18 captured both crescent Moon and crescent Earth. It\r\nwas the first time the two celestial bodies had ever been photographed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn November both Voyagers crossed the orbit of Mars, entering the\r\nasteroid belt a month later. On December 15, at a distance of about 170\r\nmillion kilometers from Earth, Voyager 1 finally speeded past its slower\r\ntwin. The journey through the asteroid belt was long but uneventful:\r\nVoyager 1 emerged safely in September 1978, and Voyager 2 in October.\r\nUnlike Pioneers 10 and 11, the Voyagers carried no instruments to look\r\nat debris in the asteroid belt.\r\n\r\nBy April both spacecraft were already halfway to Jupiter and, about two\r\nmonths later, Voyager 1, still approximately 265 million kilometers from\r\nJupiter, began returning photographs of the planet that showed\r\nconsiderable detail, although less than could be obtained with\r\ntelescopes on Earth. Both the imaging (TV) and the planetary radio\r\nastronomy instruments began observing Jupiter, and, by October 2, 1978,\r\nofficials announced that “the polarization characteristics of Jupiter’s\r\nradio emissions have been defined. In the high frequencies, there is\r\nconsistent right-hand circular polarization, while in the low\r\nfrequencies, there is a consistent left-hand circular polarization. This\r\nwas an unexpected result.” In addition to scientific studies of the\r\ninterplanetary medium and a first look at Jupiter, the plasma wave\r\ninstrument, which studies waves of charged particles over a range of\r\nfrequencies that includes audio frequencies, was able to record the\r\nsound of the spacecraft thrusters firing, as hydrazine fuel is\r\ndecomposed and ejected into space. The sound was described as being\r\n“somewhat like a 5-gallon can being hit with a leather-wrapped mallet.”\r\n\r\nOn December 10, 1978, 83 million kilometers from Jupiter, Voyager 1 took\r\nphotographs that surpassed the best photographs ever taken from\r\nground-based telescopes, and scientists were anxiously awaiting the\r\nstart of continuous coverage of the rapidly changing cloud forms. These\r\npictures, together with data from several ground-based observatories,\r\nwere carefully scrutinized by a team of scientists at JPL to select the\r\nfinal targets in the atmosphere of Jupiter to be studied at high\r\nresolution during the flyby. The observatory phase of Voyager 1’s\r\njourney to Jupiter was about to begin.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: As Voyager 1 approached Jupiter, the resolution of\r\n    the images steadily improved. In October 1978, at a distance of\r\n    about 125 million kilometers, the image was less clear than would be\r\n    obtained with an Earth-based telescope. [P-20790]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: By December 10, the spacecraft had moved to a\r\n    distance of 85 million kilometers, and the resolution was about 2000\r\n    kilometers, comparable to the best telescopic images.

[P-20945C]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         The Observatory Phase\r\n\r\nThe observatory phase, originally scheduled to start on December 15,\r\n1978, eighty days before encounter, was postponed until January 4, 1979,\r\nto provide the flight team a holiday-season break. For the next two\r\nmonths, Voyager would carry out a long-term scientific study—a “time\r\nhistory”—of Jupiter, its satellites, and its magnetosphere. On January\r\n6, Voyager 1 began photographing Jupiter every two hours—each time\r\ntaking a series of four photographs through different color filters as\r\npart of a long-duration study of large-scale atmospheric processes, so\r\nscientists could study the changing cloud patterns on Jupiter. Even the\r\nfirst of these pictures showed that the atmosphere was dynamic “with\r\nmore convective structure than had previously been thought.”\r\nParticularly striking were the changes in the planet, especially near\r\nthe Great Red Spot, that had taken place since the Pioneer flybys in\r\n1973 and 1974. Jupiter was wearing a new face for Voyager.\r\n\r\nIn mid-January, photos of Jupiter were already being praised for\r\n“showing exceptional details of the planet’s multicolored bands of\r\nclouds.” Still 47 million kilometers from the giant, Voyager 1 had by\r\nnow taken more than 500 photographs of Jupiter. Movements of cloud\r\npatterns were becoming more obvious; feathery structures seemed painted\r\nacross some of the bands that encircle the planet; swirling features\r\nwere huddled near the Great Red Spot. The satellites were also beginning\r\nto look more like worlds, with a few bright spots visible on Ganymede\r\nand dark red poles and a bright equatorial region clearly seen on Io\r\nwhen it passed once each orbit across the turbulent face of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nFrom January 30 to February 3, Voyager sent back one photograph of\r\nJupiter every 96 seconds over a 100-hour period. Using a total of three\r\ndifferent color filters, the spacecraft thus produced one color picture\r\nevery 4¾ minutes, in order to make a “movie” covering ten Jovian “days.”\r\nTo receive these pictures, sent back over the high-rate X-band\r\ntransmitter, the Deep Space Network’s 64-meter antennas provided\r\nround-the-clock coverage. Voyager 1 was ready for its far encounter\r\nphase.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Galilean satellites of Jupiter first began to\r\n    show as tiny worlds, not mere points of light, as the Voyager 1\r\n    observatory phase began. In this view taken January 17, 1979, at a\r\n    range of 47 million kilometers, the differing sizes and surface\r\n    reflectivities (albedos) of Ganymede (right center) and Europa (top\r\n    right) are clearly visible. The view of Jupiter is unusual in that\r\n    the Great Red Spot is not easily visible, but can just be seen at\r\n    the right edge of the planet. Most pictures selected for publication\r\n    include the photogenic Red Spot. [P-20938C]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Far Encounter Phase\r\n\r\nBy early February Jupiter loomed too large in the narrow-angle camera to\r\nbe photographed in one piece; 2 × 2 three-color (violet, orange, green)\r\nsets of pictures were taken for the next two weeks; by February 21,\r\nJupiter had grown too large even for that, and 3 × 3 sets were scheduled\r\nto begin. When these sets of pictures are pasted together to form a\r\nsingle picture, the result is called a mosaic.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: By February 1, 1979, Voyager 1 was only 30 million\r\n    kilometers from Jupiter, and the resolution of the imaging system\r\n    corresponded to about 600 kilometers at the cloud tops of the giant\r\n    planet. At this time, a great deal of unexpected complexity became\r\n    apparent around the Red Spot, and movie sequences clearly showed the\r\n    cloud motions, including the apparent six-day rotation of the Red\r\n    Spot. [P-20993C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: One of the most spectacular planetary photographs\r\n    ever taken was obtained on February 13 as Voyager 1 continued its\r\n    approach to Jupiter. By this time, at a range of 20 million\r\n    kilometers, Jupiter loomed too large to fit within a single\r\n    narrow-angle imaging frame. Passing in front of the planet are the\r\n    inner two Galilean satellites. Io, on the left, already shows\r\n    brightly colored patterns on its surface, while Europa, on the\r\n    right, is a bland ice-covered world. The scale of all of these\r\n    objects is huge by terrestrial standards; Io and Europa are each the\r\n    size of our Moon, and the Red Spot is larger than the Earth.\r\n    [P-21082C]]\r\n\r\nWhile the imaging experiments were in the limelight, the other\r\nscientific instruments had also begun to concentrate on the Jovian\r\nsystem. The ultraviolet spectrometer had been scanning the region eight\r\ntimes a day; the infrared spectrometer (IRIS) spent 1½ hours a day\r\nanalyzing infrared emissions from various longitudes in Jupiter’s\r\natmosphere; the planetary radio astronomy and plasma wave instruments\r\nlooked for radio bursts from Jupiter and for plasma disturbances in the\r\nregion; the photopolarimeter had begun searching for the edge of Io’s\r\nsodium torus; and a watch was begun for the bow shock—the outer boundary\r\nof the Jovian magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nOn February 10, Voyager 1 crossed the orbit of Sinope, Jupiter’s\r\noutermost satellite. Yet the spacecraft even then had a long way to\r\ngo—still 23 million kilometers from Jupiter, but closing in on the\r\nplanet at nearly a million kilometers a day. A week later, targeted\r\nphotographs of Callisto began to provide coverage of the satellite all\r\naround its orbit; similar photos of Ganymede began on February 25.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile excitement was building. As early as February 8 and 9, delight\r\nwith the mission and anticipation of the results of the encounter in\r\nMarch were already evident. Garry E. Hunt, from the Laboratory for\r\nPlanetary Atmospheres, University College, London, a member of the\r\nImaging Team, discussing the appearance of Jupiter’s atmosphere as seen\r\nby Voyager during the previous month, said “It seems to be far more\r\nphotogenic now than it did during the Pioneer encounters; I’m more than\r\ndelighted by it—it’s an incredible state of affairs. There are\r\ninfinitely more details than ever imagined.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager Project was operated from the Jet\r\n    Propulsion Laboratory managed for NASA by the California Institute\r\n    of Technology. Located in the hills above Pasadena, California, JPL\r\n    is the main center for U.S. exploration of the solar system.\r\n    [JB17249BC]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager TV cameras do not take color pictures\r\n    directly as do commercial cameras. Instead, a color image is\r\n    reconstructed on the ground from three separate monochromatic\r\n    images, obtained through color filters and transmitted separately to\r\n    Earth. There are a number of possible filter combinations, but the\r\n    most nearly “true” color is obtained with originals photographed in\r\n    blue (480 nanometers), green (565 nanometers), and orange (590\r\n    nanometers) light. Before these can be combined, the individual\r\n    frames must be registered, correcting for any change in spacecraft\r\n    position or pointing between exposures. Often, only part of a scene\r\n    is contained in all three original pictures. Shown here is a\r\n    reconstruction of a plume on Jupiter, photographed on March 1, 1979.\r\n    The colors used to print the three separate frames can be seen\r\n    clearly in the nonoverlapping areas. For other pictures in this\r\n    book, the nonoverlapping partial frames are omitted. [P-21192]]\r\n\r\nThe pictures from Voyager are “clearly spectacular,” said Lonne Lane,\r\nAssistant Project Scientist for Jupiter. “We’re getting even better\r\nresults than we had anticipated. We have seen new phenomena in both\r\noptical and radio emissions. We have definitely seen things that are\r\ndifferent—in at least in one case, unanticipated—and are begging for\r\nanswers we haven’t got.” There was already, still almost a month from\r\nencounter, a strong feeling of accomplishment among the scientists and\r\nengineers; they had done a difficult task and it has been successful.\r\n\r\nBy the last week of February 1979, the attention of thousands of\r\nindividuals was focused on the activities at JPL. Scientists had arrived\r\nfrom universities and laboratories around the country and from abroad,\r\nmany bringing graduate students or faculty colleagues to assist them.\r\nEngineers and technicians from JPL contractors joined NASA officials as\r\nthe Pasadena motels filled up. Special badges were issued and reserved\r\nparking areas set aside for the Voyager influx. Twenty-four hours a day,\r\nlights burned in the flight control rooms, the science offices, the\r\ncomputer areas, and the photo processing labs. In order to protect those\r\nwith critical tasks to perform from the friendly distraction of the new\r\narrivals, special computer-controlled locks were placed on doors, and\r\nsecurity officers began to patrol the halls. By the end of the month the\r\npress had begun to arrive. Amid accelerating excitement, the Voyager 1\r\nencounter was about to begin.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The smaller-scale clouds on Jupiter tend to be more\r\n    irregular than the large ovals and plumes. At the lower right, one\r\n    of the three large white ovals clearly shows internal structure,\r\n    with the swirling cloud pattern indicating counterclockwise, or\r\n    anticyclonic, flow. A smaller anticyclonic white feature near the\r\n    center is surrounded by a dark, cloud-free band where one can see to\r\n    greater depths in the atmosphere. This photo was taken March 1 from\r\n    a distance of 4 million kilometers. [P-21183C]]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER 6\r\n                          THE FIRST ENCOUNTER\r\n\r\n\r\n                     The Giant Is Full of Surprises\r\n\r\nThe Voyager 1 encounter took place at 4:42 a.m. PST, March 5, 1979.\r\nAbout six hours before, while the spacecraft continued to hurtle on\r\ntoward Jupiter, overflow crowds had poured out of Beckman Auditorium on\r\nthe campus of the California Institute of Technology. There had been a\r\nsymposium entitled Jupiter and the Mind of Man. More than one face that\r\nevening had turned to look toward the Pasadena night, for there,\r\nglittering against the fabric of the sky, was the “star” of the show—a\r\nplanet so huge that the Earth would be but a blemish on its Great Red\r\nSpot. One might have tried to imagine Voyager 1, large by spacecraft\r\nstandards, rapidly closing in on Jupiter—a pesky, investigative\r\n“mosquito” buzzing around the Jovian system.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, at JPL, pictures taken by Voyager 1 were flashing back every\r\n48 seconds, pictures that were already revealing more and more of\r\nJupiter’s atmosphere and would soon disclose four new worlds—the\r\nGalilean satellites. The encounter was almost at hand.\r\n\r\n4:42 a.m.—Voyager 1 had made its closest approach to Jupiter 37 minutes\r\nearlier. Only now were the signals that had been sent out from the\r\nspacecraft at 4:05 a.m. reaching the Earth.\r\n\r\nBut the moment of closest encounter did not have the same impact a\r\nlanding would have had. Although the champagne would flow later for\r\nthose who had worked so long and hard on this successful mission, there\r\nwas none now. In the press room there were just four coffeepots working\r\novertime to help keep the press alert. In the science areas, focus had\r\nshifted to the satellite encounters, which would stretch over the next\r\n24 hours; meanwhile, a few persons tried to catch a little sleep at\r\ntheir desks before the first closeups of Io came in. The instant of\r\nencounter came ... and went ... with no screams, no New Year’s\r\nnoisemakers. All the excitement of the mission lay both behind ... and\r\nahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Thursday, February 22.\r\n\r\nThe encounter activity was kicked off in Washington, D.C., by a press\r\nconference at NASA Headquarters. After introductory statements by NASA\r\nand JPL officials, some of the scientific results from the observatory\r\nand far encounter phases were presented.\r\n\r\nBoth the plasma wave and the planetary radio astronomy instruments had\r\ndetected very-low-frequency radio emission that generally increased in\r\nintensity whenever either the north or south magnetic pole of Jupiter\r\ntipped toward the spacecraft. The plasma wave experiment had also\r\ndetected radiation that seemed to come from a region either near or\r\nbeyond the orbit of Io—perhaps even as far as the outer magnetosphere.\r\nIn addition, Frederick L. Scarf, Principal Investigator for the plasma\r\nwave instrument, released a recording of the ion sound waves created by\r\n5 to 10 kilovolt energy protons traveling upstream from Jupiter.\r\n\r\nJames Warwick, Principal Investigator of the radio astronomy\r\ninvestigation, enthusiastically reported the detection of a striking new\r\nlow-frequency radiation from Jupiter, at wavelengths of tens of\r\nkilometers. Such radio waves cannot penetrate the ionosphere of the\r\nEarth, and thus had never been detected before. Because of their huge\r\nscale, these bursts probably did not originate at Jupiter itself, but in\r\nmagnetospheric regions above the planet—perhaps in association with the\r\nhigh-density plasma torus associated with Io. Warwick commented that\r\n“only from the magnificent perspective of the Voyager as it approaches\r\nJupiter have we been able to get this complete picture.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager 1 encounter with Jupiter took place\r\n    during a little more than 48 hours, from the inbound to the outbound\r\n    crossing of the orbit of Callisto.

The\r\nscientists had expected to find very weak ultraviolet emissions on the\r\nsunlit side of Jupiter, caused by sunlight being scattered from hydrogen\r\nand helium in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. “Instead we are seeing a\r\nspectacular auroral display. There are two features of the emission—the\r\nauroral emission which comes from the planet and a second type of\r\nemission which appears to come from a radiating torus or shell around\r\nthe planet at the orbit of Io. The spectral content of these two\r\nradiating sources is distinctly different. What we find is that the\r\nauroral emission from Jupiter’s atmosphere is so strong that it\r\ncompletely dominates the emission spectrum even on the sunlit side of\r\nthe atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“Not since Mariner 4 carried its TV camera to Mars fifteen years ago\r\nhave we been less prepared—have we been less certain of what we are\r\nabout to see over the next two weeks,” said Bradford Smith, Imaging Team\r\nLeader. He mentioned the time-lapse “rotation movie,” in which the\r\ncolorful planet spun through ten full Jupiter days; tiny images of the\r\nsatellites passed across Jupiter’s face as though being whipped along by\r\nthe rotation of the giant. A week or so earlier, when this film had been\r\nshown for the first time to the full Imaging Team, it provided an\r\noccasion for good-humored rivalry between planet people and satellite\r\npeople, with jokes about the satellites getting in the way of the\r\nimportant studies of Jupiter. For the next few days, the imaging focus\r\nremained on Jupiter; it shifted to Io, Ganymede, and Callisto, as each\r\nwas passed in turn after closest approach to the planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Tuesday, February 27.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 7.1 million kilometers_). At a distance of 660\r\nmillion kilometers from Earth, within 90 Jovian radii (R_J) of Jupiter,\r\nVoyager 1 was prepared to begin the encounter with the planet’s\r\nmagnetosphere. On the previous day the spacecraft had crossed the point,\r\nat 100 R_J, at which Pioneers 10 and 11 had found the bow shock, the\r\nfirst indication of the magnetospheric boundary. The start of Voyager’s\r\nplunge into the Jovian magnetosphere was overdue, and scientists\r\nanxiously watched the data from the particles and fields instruments,\r\nlooking for the first indication of disordered magnetic fields and\r\naltered particle densities that would mark the bow shock. Apparently,\r\nhigher solar wind pressure, associated with increased solar activity\r\nsince 1974, had compressed the magnetosphere, but no one could predict\r\nhow strong this compression might be.\r\n\r\n                  ENCOUNTER DISTANCES FOR VOYAGER 1\r\n     Object      Range to Center at Closest   Best Image Resolution\r\n                    Approach (kilometers)       (km per line pair)\r\n\r\n  Jupiter                            349 000                       8\r\n  Amalthea                           417 000                       8\r\n  Io                                  21 000                       1\r\n  Europa                             734 000                      33\r\n  Ganymede                           115 000                       2\r\n  Callisto                           126 000                       2\r\n\r\nFor the first time since its discovery, Lyle Broadfoot and his UVS\r\ncolleagues suggested a probable identification for the unexpected\r\nultraviolet emission near the orbit of Io. The most likely candidate was\r\nsulfur atoms with two electrons removed (S III), at an inferred\r\ntemperature perhaps as high as 200 000 K. An additional indication of\r\nsulfur came from Mike Krimigis, who reported that the low-energy charged\r\nparticles instrument had detected bursts of sulfur ions streaming away\r\nfrom Jupiter that had apparently escaped from the inner magnetosphere.\r\nNo explanations were offered, however, for the presence of large amounts\r\nof this element.\r\n\r\nAt JPL, a press room had been opened in Von Karman Auditorium to\r\naccommodate the hundred or so reporters expected to arrive. To keep all\r\nthe interested people informed of Voyager progress, frequent television\r\nreports were beamed over closed-circuit TV throughout JPL. From an\r\nin-lab television studio called the Blue Room, JPL scientist Al Hibbs,\r\nwho had played a similar role during the Viking Mission to Mars,\r\nprovided hourly reports and interviewed members of the Voyager teams. As\r\nthe pressure for constant commentary and instant analysis increased,\r\nGarry Hunt of the Imaging Team was also called on to host activities in\r\nthe Blue Room, where his British accent added an additional touch of\r\nclass to the operation.\r\n\r\nAs the encounter progressed, the JPL television reports reached a wider\r\naudience. In the Los Angeles area, KCET Public Television began a\r\nnightly “Jupiter Watch” program, with Dr. Hibbs as host. During the\r\nencounter days, service was extended to interested public television\r\nstations throughout the nation. In this way, tens of thousands of\r\npersons were able to experience the thrill of discovery, seeing the\r\ncloseup pictures of Jupiter and its satellites at the same moment as the\r\nscientists at JPL saw them, and listening to the excited and frequently\r\nawestruck commentary as the first tentative interpretations were\r\nattempted. Unfortunately, the commercial television networks did not\r\nmake use of this opportunity, and the greatest coverage available to\r\nmost of the country was a 90-second commentary on the nightly network\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Wednesday, February 28.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 5.9 million kilometers_). At 6:33 a.m., at a range\r\nof 86 R_J, Voyager 1 finally reached Jupiter’s bow shock. But by 12:28\r\np.m. the solar wind had pushed the magnetosphere back toward Jupiter,\r\nand Voyager was once more outside, back in the solar wind. Not until\r\nMarch 2, at a distance of less than 45 R_J, would the spacecraft enter\r\nthe magnetosphere for the final time.\r\n\r\nAt 11 a.m. the first daily briefing to the press was given. “After\r\nnearly two months of atmospheric imaging and perhaps a week or two of\r\nsatellite viewing, [we’re] happily bewildered,” said Brad Smith. The\r\nJovian atmosphere is “where our greatest state of confusion seems to\r\nexist right at the moment, although over the next several days we may\r\nfind that some of our smirking geology friends will find themselves in a\r\nsimilar state. I think, for the most part, we have to say that the\r\nexisting atmospheric circulation models have all been shot to hell by\r\nVoyager. Although these models can still explain some of the coarse\r\nzonal flow patterns, they fail entirely in explaining the detailed\r\nbehavior that Voyager is now revealing.” It was thought, from Pioneer\r\nresults, that Jupiter’s atmosphere showed primarily horizontal or zonal\r\nflow near the equatorial region, but that the zonal flow pattern broke\r\ndown at high latitudes. But Voyager found that “zonal flow exists\r\npoleward as far as we can see.”\r\n\r\nSmith also showed a time-lapse movie of Jupiter assembled from images\r\nobtained during the month of January. Once each rotation, approximately\r\nevery ten hours, a color picture had been taken. Viewed consecutively,\r\nthese frames displayed the complex cloud motions on a single hemisphere\r\nof Jupiter, as they would be seen from a fixed point above the equator\r\nof the planet. The film revealed that clouds move around the Great Red\r\nSpot in a period of about six days, at speeds of perhaps 100 meters per\r\nsecond. The Great Red Spot, as well as many of the smaller spots that\r\ndot the planet, appeared to be rotating anticyclonically. Anticyclonic\r\nmotion is characteristic of high-pressure regions, unlike terrestrial\r\nstorms. Smith noted that “Jupiter is far more complex in its atmospheric\r\nmotions than we had ever imagined. We are seeing a much more complicated\r\nflow of cyclonic and anticyclonic vorticity, circulation. We see\r\ncurrents which flow along and seem to interact with an obstacle and turn\r\naround and flow back.” There is a Jovian jet stream that is “moving\r\nalong at well over 100 meters per second. Several of these curious\r\nlittle dark features that appear to be small brown spots near Jupiter’s\r\nnorth temperate region have been seen to overtake one another and gobble\r\neach other up. And then they occasionally spit out a piece here and\r\nthere as they move along.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Thursday, March 1.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 4.8 million kilometers_). At 5 a.m., at a distance\r\nof 71 R_J, Voyager crossed the bow shock for the third time, catching up\r\nwith the contracting magnetosphere of the planet. About noon, at 66 R_J,\r\nthe spacecraft finally reached the boundary of the magnetosphere, called\r\nthe magnetopause. Herbert Bridge, the plasma instrument Principal\r\nInvestigator, noted that the solar wind pressure as monitored by Voyager\r\n2, still between the Sun and Jupiter, had been for several days from two\r\nto five times greater than its level during the Pioneer 10 and 11\r\nencounters. Presumably, this high pressure was the cause of the\r\ncompressed state of the magnetosphere. However, in the previous few\r\nhours the solar pressure had dropped, so Bridge anticipated that the\r\nJovian magnetosphere might soon inflate and expand outward.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The southern hemisphere of Jupiter presents a\r\n    tremendous diversity of atmospheric structure and motion. The Great\r\n    Red Spot rotates counterclockwise in about six days; above and below\r\n    it high-speed jet streams flow to the right and the left, while a\r\n    complex, dynamic cloud pattern develops in its wake. This picture\r\n    was taken on February 25, when Voyager 1 was 9 million kilometers\r\n    from the planet. [P-21151C]]\r\n\r\nFred Scarf intrigued the press with a tape of the sounds made by\r\nhigh-energy protons coming upstream from Jupiter. The plasma wave\r\ninstrument had recorded the noise of the protons, mixed with the noise\r\nof the spacecraft itself, producing sound effects that sounded somewhat\r\nlike a mixture of singing whales, a Nor’easter, and the Daytona 500.\r\n\r\nAt the press briefing, interest in the imaging results began to shift\r\nfrom Jupiter toward the satellites. Pictures of each of the four big\r\nGalilean moons revealed bright and dark features as small as about 200\r\nkilometers across. Unfortunately, this resolution is not enough to be\r\ndiagnostic—the spots cannot be interpreted in terms of recognizable\r\ngeological features, such as mountains or craters. Today one could only\r\nspeculate, but tomorrow or the next day the answers would begin to come\r\nin. Deputy Imaging Team Leader Larry Soderblom conveyed his excitement\r\nthrough a metaphor that would be repeated many times during the next\r\nweek: “We’re beginning a stage in this mission which represents, I\r\nthink, one of the most exciting points in man’s scientific exploration\r\nof the solar system—in the next few days, we’ll explore four new\r\nworlds,” seeing in a few days’ time what it took us centuries to learn\r\nabout other worlds in our solar system. In terms of our experience with\r\nthe exploration of Mars, “it is about 1700 AD this morning, tomorrow it\r\nwill be about 1800, and it will be about 1976 [the year of Viking] by\r\nTuesday evening.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Friday, March 2.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 3.6 million kilometers_). Early in the morning, a\r\ntwelvefold increase in solar wind pressure caused another contraction of\r\nthe magnetosphere, which was behaving like a spring, compressing in\r\nresponse to outside forces. As the magnetopause boundary moved rapidly\r\ninward, it crossed the spacecraft at 59 R_J from the planet. An hour\r\nlater the bow shock also flashed past, and Voyager was once more in the\r\ninterplanetary medium. By noon reinflation of the magnetosphere began\r\nagain; Voyager crossed the bow shock for the fifth and final time at 55\r\nR_J, followed by three more magnetopause crossings, as the\r\nmagnetospheric boundary flopped in and out between 45 R_J and 50 R_J.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A few days before encounter, the Voyager images of\r\n    the larger Galilean satellites, Callisto and Ganymede, were\r\n    beginning to show distinctive surfaces with many bright spots. These\r\n    two pictures were taken on March 5 at a range of 8 million\r\n    kilometers; the resolution is about 100 kilometers. Although\r\n    extremely tantalizing, these images were uninterpretable, because\r\n    the spots could not be associated with any recognizable geological\r\n    features, such as mountains or craters. Like a naked-eye view of the\r\n    Moon, these pictures seemed to reveal more than was actually\r\n    meaningful. [P-21188C and P-21150C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ganymede]\r\n\r\nSome Project officials began to worry about the contracted state of the\r\nmagnetosphere. The radiation “hardening” of Voyager was carried out to\r\nprotect against the energetic particle fluxes observed by Pioneers 10\r\nand 11. Under the new conditions, would the particles in the inner\r\nmagnetosphere be more concentrated and perhaps increase the radiation\r\nlevels beyond the design limits? Scientists asked how long the\r\ncompression might last and speculated about how much energy might be\r\npumped into the Jovian radiation belts, but only time could provide the\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\n   VOYAGER 1 BOW SHOCK (S) AND MAGNETOPAUSE (M) CROSSINGS\r\n       Boundary              Day          Distance (R_J)\r\n                         _Inbound_\r\n\r\n  S                                2/28                 86\r\n  S                                2/28                 82\r\n  S                                3/01                 72\r\n  M                                3/01                 67\r\n  M                                3/02                 59\r\n  S                                3/02                 58\r\n  S                                3/02                 56\r\n  M                                3/03                 47\r\n\r\n                         _Outbound_\r\n\r\n  M                                3/13                158\r\n  M                                3/13                163\r\n  M                                3/13                165\r\n  S                                3/16                199\r\n  S                                3/18                227\r\n  S                                3/18                227\r\n  S                                3/19                240\r\n  S                                3/20                256\r\n  S                                3/20                258\r\n\r\nAccurate recording of the X-band data being sent from Voyager at 115\r\nthousand bits per second required fairly clear weather at the tracking\r\nsites. The three Deep Space Network (DSN) stations in California, Spain,\r\nand Australia are located at normally dry sites. However, early in the\r\nmorning, heavy rain at the Australian site interfered with reception of\r\nthe Voyager signal for fourteen minutes. Fortunately, the loss occurred\r\nwhen the DSN tracking of the spacecraft was being switched from\r\nGoldstone, California, to the Australian station. Mission control was\r\nable to extend Goldstone coverage for several minutes so that only about\r\nthree minutes’ worth of data was lost completely.\r\n\r\nA more positive announcement was made at the press conference that\r\nmorning by Donald Shemansky of the Ultraviolet Spectroscopy Team: the\r\ndiscovery of a high-energy torus of doubly ionized sulfur (S III)\r\ncircling Jupiter in the region of Io’s orbit. “We were surprised out of\r\nour chairs to see a spectacularly bright emission in the 650-1100\r\nangstrom region, immediately implying that we were looking at a plasma\r\nthat had to be at a temperature of about 100 000 degrees.” The\r\nscientists estimated that the density of this torus must be at least 500\r\nions per cubic centimeter, and that the power needed to keep this plasma\r\nat such a high temperature must be in the neighborhood of 500 billion\r\nwatts. As Al Hibbs mentioned on “Jupiter Watch” that night, 500 billion\r\nwatts of power is the total amount of installed generating capacity of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Saturday, March 3.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 2.5 million kilometers_). Early in the morning the\r\nfinal crossing of the magnetopause took place at 47 R_J, and Voyager\r\nfinally joined the Jovian system. At the end of the day, the rapidly\r\nmoving spacecraft crossed the orbit of Callisto, but that satellite\r\nitself was on the far side of the planet. Not until the outbound\r\ncrossing of its orbit on March 6 would closeup views of Callisto be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nDuring the preceding night, a severe summer thunderstorm in Australia\r\nagain caused a loss of data. A line of storms over the tracking station\r\nblocked the high-rate, X-band science data for three hours and twenty\r\nminutes. Attempts were made to save a part of the data by commanding the\r\nspacecraft to slow its transmission rate, rather like speaking slowly to\r\na partially deaf listener. But by the time the craft received the signal\r\nand responded, the storms had intensified, and no signal could get\r\nthrough. Closeups of the Great Red Spot and an extended series of\r\nobservations of the glowing sodium cloud around Io were lost.\r\n\r\nA black-and-white movie assembled from photos obtained in January and\r\nFebruary was shown at the press conference. The movie was taken from\r\nobservatory phase pictures photographed in blue light. From these\r\npictures, the imaging team “put together this so-called ‘blue movie’,”\r\nsaid Brad Smith, introducing the film. The film showed changes taking\r\nplace in Jupiter’s atmosphere over a period of about seventy Jovian\r\ndays. Near the equator there were “bright plumes floating by—at high\r\nspeed the plumes seem to wave around, something like a flag waving in\r\nthe breeze.” Farther north, along the edge of the north temperate zone,\r\none could see one of the dark ovals—“a rather fuzzy one would move up,\r\ncatch up with the one just ahead of it, get stuck to the outside and\r\nroll around on it for a while, then get ejected a little later.” Dr.\r\nSmith also showed new closeup views of the region around the Red Spot,\r\nshowing not only the anticyclonic features but filamentary\r\n“spaghettilike” material which was rotating in a cyclonic direction,\r\nindicating a low-pressure region. “The filamentary material still seems\r\nto be rather a mystery—very difficult to see the details of the motion.”\r\nBut the photographs were already showing what seemed to be stream lines\r\nin the white ovals. “In appearance the white ovals seem to resemble the\r\nRed Spot. The stream lines are at least suggestive of divergent flow,\r\nthat is, material in each of these spots which is upwelling in these\r\nareas and then moving out tends to go around in a counterclockwise\r\nanticyclonic motion but may, at the same time, be slowly diverging\r\noutward.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: At a resolution of about 100 kilometers a planetary\r\n    surface just begins to reveal its personality. Io was photographed\r\n    against the disk of Jupiter on February 26, from a distance of about\r\n    8 million kilometers. Such early pictures whetted the appetites of\r\n    the Voyager scientists at JPL as they anxiously speculated about\r\n    what they would find in closer views of the surface of this\r\n    remarkable satellite. [P-21185 B/W]]\r\n\r\nThe large white ovals are about forty years old. Dr. Smith explained how\r\nthey formed: Between 1939 and 1940, “where those three white spots exist\r\nright now, was a rather bright band similar to the north temperate zone\r\nwe see on Jupiter right now. In that time period of a year or so, three\r\ndarkish spots formed. A dark cloud spread out at each one of those three\r\nlocations and just kept spreading longitudinally until the white\r\nmaterial condensed between them.” In the end, everything was dark except\r\nfor the three ovals, which have persisted ever since.\r\n\r\nTorrence Johnson of the Imaging Team commented on a photo of Io in which\r\nfeatures resembling circular crater-type structures seemed to be\r\nvisible. “Whatever they are, [those circular features] are approaching\r\nthe size of the things that we would call basins if they were impact\r\nstructures on other planets. We don’t really know whether they’re impact\r\nstructures. They have some characteristics that look reminiscent of\r\nimpact structures. They could be endogenic—volcanic in origin—or\r\ninternally generated in some other way.” Johnson also showed another\r\nphotograph of Io, this one taken against black sky, showing a\r\n“strikingly different face” looking, perhaps, like someone’s nightmare,\r\nglaring back at the intruder from Earth. One huge feature—a “bullseye”\r\nor “hoof print” on Io—appeared to be approximately 1000 kilometers long.\r\nNo one had ever seen such a feature, and the imaging scientists could\r\nonly speculate about its significance.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Small-scale structures in the jet streams of\r\n    Jupiter’s north tropical zone reveal details of atmospheric\r\n    circulation. The small dark oval near the right edge of the zone may\r\n    offer a glimpse deep into Jupiter’s atmosphere. Between the\r\n    regularly spaced dark ovals near the bottom of the frame are more\r\n    small-scale features that are being studied for their roles in\r\n    Jovian atmospheric activity. The blue-gray regions along the shear\r\n    line between the equatorial zone and the north equatorial belt also\r\n    appear to be windows into the deeper regions of the atmosphere. This\r\n    photo was taken February 19 by Voyager 1 from a distance of 14\r\n    million kilometers. [P-21160C]]\r\n\r\nA few days earlier, someone had posted in the Imaging Team area a quote\r\nfrom a 1975 review paper on the Jovian satellites by David Morrison and\r\nJoseph Burns. The section on Io began, “Io is one of the most intriguing\r\nobjects in the solar system.” This statement seemed more and more\r\nappropriate as Voyager images improved. Johnson referred to this day as\r\nequivalent to the “late 1960s” in our study of the Jovian satellites.\r\n“We can see much more clearly than ever before, but still not clearly\r\nenough to provide understanding of what we are seeing.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Sunday, March 4.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 1.2 million kilometers_). At 4:37 a.m., the near\r\nencounter phase began: Voyager 1 was almost there! In the press room,\r\nsomeone taped a fortune cookie message to the Voyager TV monitor: “There\r\nis a prospect of a thrilling time ahead for you.”\r\n\r\nPulled by the powerful gravity of Jupiter, the spacecraft was now on a\r\ncurved path through the inner Jovian system. At 2 p.m. PST, it crossed\r\nthe orbit of Ganymede, and later in the afternoon it passed within less\r\nthan 2 million kilometers of Europa, providing Voyager 1’s closest look\r\nat this satellite. During the afternoon and evening, a number of views\r\nwere obtained of Amalthea, the small inner satellite, at a range of less\r\nthan 500 000 kilometers. At 8 p.m. the orbit of Europa was crossed, and\r\nincreasing attention was drawn to the coming encounter with Io. At about\r\n7 p.m. a full-frame color sequence of Io was received with a resolution\r\nof 16 kilometers. During the night, as Imaging Team members scratched\r\ntheir heads trying to prepare a press release caption to interpret the\r\npeculiar structures seen, the JPL Image Processing Lab rushed to prepare\r\na color version for release the next day.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Great Red Spot became more and more spectacular\r\n    as Voyager 1 approached, with each day revealing new and intricate\r\n    detail in the clouds.

Just barely visible to Voyager 1, these streaks\r\n    were dramatically apparent to Voyager 2 in its closer flyby in July.\r\n    [P-21208C]]\r\n\r\nOnce again, tracking station problems interrupted the smooth flow of\r\ndata from the spacecraft. Failure at Madrid to reestablish the correct\r\nreceiver frequency after a spacecraft maneuver resulted in the loss of\r\n53 minutes of irreplaceable data; an additional eleven minutes were lost\r\nan hour later. As the first problem was being corrected, the tracking\r\nantenna became misaligned, resulting in a noisy data return. Meanwhile,\r\nonly a few of the watchers at JPL mourned the lost data, so exciting\r\nwere the other new results that kept pouring in.\r\n\r\n“For the highlights of this morning Dr. Soderblom will come up and show\r\nsome beautiful satellite pictures,” Brad Smith announced at the daily\r\npress briefing. Larry Soderblom’s excitement was hard to contain. “Today\r\nis probably going to turn out to be one of the most memorable days in\r\nour exploration program. For the planetary geologists it’s truly\r\nChristmas Eve. We see tonight the beginning of the exploration of four\r\nnew worlds. We’re racing through time and space at an incredible\r\nrate—the rate at which we are learning things is awe-inspiring in\r\nitself.” Callisto was still too far away to see well “but the things\r\nwe’re seeing on the closer three satellites have really got us charged\r\nin anticipation.” Ganymede—“What can I say? Loops and swirls and\r\nincredible patches that are difficult now to hazard a guess about.”\r\nIo—an eerie-looking red, orange, and yellow world—“this one we’ve got\r\nall figured out. [Laughter from the press and applause.] It is covered\r\nwith thin candy shells of anything from sulfates and sulfur and salts to\r\nall kinds of strange things.”\r\n\r\nThe low energy charged particle instrument had discovered high-speed\r\nsulfur in the outer Jovian magnetosphere, ten times as far from the\r\nplanet as the sulfur torus around Io. The high-speed sulfur, which\r\nwhizzed by Voyager 1 at 8000 kilometers per second, was first detected\r\nas the spacecraft crossed the magnetopause and entered the\r\nmagnetosphere. Apparently this sulfur had picked up speed as it moved\r\noutward from Io’s torus, but the mechanism for this acceleration was not\r\nknown. Roby Vogt reported that the cosmic ray instrument was detecting\r\ntwo distinct groups of atoms closer in to the planet. One group was\r\napparently of solar composition (derived from the solar wind), and the\r\nother showed enhanced oxygen as well as sulfur. The plasma instrument\r\nhad also begun to measure sulfur in the same form (S III) as that\r\ndetected by the UVS in the Io torus. Where, the scientists asked, could\r\nthe oxygen and sulfur be coming from? Could Io be the source of these\r\natoms?\r\n\r\nAt one point, as questions from the press became too detailed, asking\r\nfor “instant analyses” of the data, Dr. Smith was prompted to make the\r\nfollowing statement: “I want to say something about what’s going on\r\nright now in the imaging area because we get a lot of pointed questions.\r\nWe have a remarkably good system that is getting extremely good\r\nphotographs. Not only are the cameras working well, but Jupiter and the\r\nsatellites are cooperating by showing a lot of truly remarkable detail.\r\nAnd it may sound unprofessional, but a lot of the people up in the\r\nImaging Team area are just standing around with their mouths hanging\r\nopen watching the pictures come in, and you don’t like to tear yourself\r\naway to go and start looking at numbers on a printout. We will do that,\r\nbut in the meantime we’re just caught up in the excitement of what’s\r\ngoing on.”\r\n\r\nWhile the press briefing was underway, between 11:38 and 11:50 a.m., a\r\nspecial experiment was being tried on board the Voyager. As the\r\nspacecraft passed through the plane of the equator of Jupiter, it aimed\r\nits narrow-angle camera to a point in space halfway between the cloud\r\ntops and the orbit of Amalthea and took a single, eleven-minute\r\nexposure. The purpose: to search for a possible faint ring around\r\nJupiter, which, if present, could best be seen by sighting along the\r\nplane of the equator. The image appeared briefly on the TV monitors,\r\nclearly showing something—a strange band of light—streaking across the\r\ncenter of the frame. Up in the imaging area, analyses began at once to\r\ndetermine if the strange band were really the sought-for ring, but it\r\nwould not be until March 7 that the identification would be confirmed\r\nand the discovery announced.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The “bullseye” of Io was first photographed at a\r\n    range of 2.8 million kilometers on March 3, and this color version\r\n    was released on March 4. At the time, Imaging Team scientists wrote\r\n    that “The large heart-shaped feature with a dark spot near its\r\n    center could be Io’s equivalent of an impact basin such as Mare\r\n    Orientale on the Moon. Its outer dimensions are about 800 by 1000\r\n    kilometers. Subsequent high-resolution coverage should reveal\r\n    whether the small dark spots are impact craters, or perhaps\r\n    something more exotic such as volcanoes. The reddish color of Io has\r\n    been attributed to sulfur in the salts which are believed by some to\r\n    make up the surface of Io.” It would be another week before this\r\n    feature, later named “Pele” for the Hawaiian volcano goddess, would\r\n    be recognized as an active, erupting volcano. [P-21187C]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Monday, March 5.\r\n\r\n(_Encounter Day. Minimum range to Jupiter, 780 000 kilometers; speed of\r\nspacecraft, almost 100 000 kilometers per hour_). Many celebrities,\r\nincluding the Governor of California, spent the night at JPL to witness\r\nthe historic occasion. In Washington, D.C., a special TV monitor was set\r\nup in the White House for the President and his family.\r\n\r\nAs late Sunday night eased into the early morning of encounter, closeup\r\nimages of Jupiter, looking more like abstract art than like planetary\r\nscience, flashed across the TV screens, and verbal images far less wild\r\nthan the visuals from Jupiter were heard from commentators and from\r\nmembers of the press. “Are you sure Van Gogh didn’t paint that?” “That’s\r\nnot Jupiter; it looks like a closeup of a salad.” “They’re not showing\r\nus Jupiter, that’s some medical school anatomy slide.”\r\n\r\nShortly before closest approach to Jupiter, Voyager began its intensive\r\nobservations of Io. Much of this information, taken while the Australian\r\nstation was tracking the spacecraft, was recorded on Voyager’s onboard\r\ntape-recorder for playback later that day. But even before the results\r\nof that imaging were known, Larry Soderblom was calling Io “one of the\r\nmost spectacular bodies in the solar system.” As more and more vivid\r\nphotos of Io appeared on the monitors, members of the Imaging Team in\r\nthe Blue Room buzzed with excitement. “This is incredible.” “The element\r\nof surprise is coming up in every one of these frames.” “I knew it would\r\nbe wild from what we saw on approach but to anticipate anything like\r\nthis would have required some sort of heavenly perspective. I think this\r\nis incredible.”\r\n\r\nAt 7:35 a.m. Voyager was scheduled to pass through the flux tube of Io,\r\nthe region in which tremendous electric currents were calculated to be\r\nflowing back and forth between the satellite and Jupiter. Norm Ness\r\nsuggested, after examining magnetometer data, that Voyager skirted the\r\nedge of the flux tube, and that the current in the tube was about one\r\nmillion amps. As the flux tube results were received, champagne bottles\r\nbegan to pop in the particles and fields science offices, in celebration\r\nof the successful passage through the inner magnetosphere. Meanwhile, at\r\n7:47 a.m., closest approach to Io occurred, at a range of only 22 000\r\nkilometers. Voyager was 25 000 times closer to this satellite than were\r\nthe watchers on Earth.\r\n\r\nAt 8:14 a.m., while still within 30 000 kilometers of Io, the spacecraft\r\npassed out of sight behind the edge of Jupiter. All scientific data for\r\nthe next two hours and six minutes were stored on the onboard tape\r\nrecorder for later transmission to Earth. Meanwhile, the radio\r\ncommunication signal was used to probe the atmosphere of Jupiter,\r\nyielding a profile of electron density in the ionosphere and of the gas\r\npressure and temperature in the upper atmosphere. While out of sight\r\nfrom Earth, at 9:07 a.m., Voyager plunged into the shadow of Jupiter. As\r\nthe Sun set on the spacecraft, the ultraviolet instrument used the\r\nabsorption of sunlight to determine the composition and temperature of\r\nthe upper atmosphere. In the darkness, the infrared IRIS measured the\r\nnight-side temperatures of the planet, and long-exposure images were\r\ntaken to search for aurora, lightning, and fireballs in the Jovian\r\natmosphere. At 10:20 a.m., Voyager reappeared from behind Jupiter and\r\nradio contact was restored; at 11:24 a.m., it emerged from shadow into\r\nsunlight, speeding on toward encounter with Ganymede.\r\n\r\nAt 8 a.m. a special press conference was held to mark the successful\r\nJupiter flyby. Noel Hinners, Associate Administrator for Space Science\r\nand the highest ranking NASA official present, congratulated all those\r\nwho had made the Voyager Mission a success. The encounter was the\r\n“culmination of a fantastic amount of dedication and effort. The result\r\nis a spectacular feat of technology and a beginning of a new era of\r\nscience for the solar system. Just watching the data come in has been\r\nfantastic. I had a fear that things on the satellites were going to look\r\nlike the lunar highlands. Nature wins again. If we’re going to see\r\nexploration of this nature occurring in the 1980s and 1990s we must\r\ncontinue to expound the results of what we’re finding here, the role of\r\nexploration in the history of our country, what it means to us as a\r\nvigorous national society.”\r\n\r\nAs time passed, it became apparent that Voyager 1 had been affected by\r\nJupiter’s radiation environment. The basic timing—the main clock on the\r\nspacecraft—had slowed down. First it slowed by 6.3 seconds, but by March\r\n6 it was found to have slowed a total of eight seconds. In addition, the\r\ntwo central computers apparently got out of synchronization both with\r\nthemselves and with the flight data subsystem. On March 6 it was\r\nreported that the spacecraft cameras were shuttering one frametime (48\r\nseconds) early; this was partly offset by the eight-second spacecraft\r\n“masterclock” slow-down resulting in images (according to our clocks)\r\nbeing photographed forty seconds early. This timing error resulted in\r\nthe camera taking some pictures while the scan platform was moving,\r\ncausing some blurred images. A number of the highest resolution images\r\nof Io and Ganymede were seriously degraded by this malfunction.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: When the first color close-up of Io was released,\r\n    Imaging Team Leader Brad Smith said that he had seen “better looking\r\n    pizzas”; hence this view, taken March 4 at a range of about 860 000\r\n    kilometers, became known as “the pizza picture.” The circular\r\n    feature in the center (the piece of pepperoni) was later revealed to\r\n    be the active volcano Prometheus, but at the time of its release\r\n    this lovely but bizarre picture baffled scientists and press alike.\r\n    [P-21457C]]\r\n\r\nAt the regular 11 a.m. press briefing, Brad Smith glowed. “We’re all\r\nrecovering from what I would call the most exciting, the most\r\nfascinating, what may ultimately prove to be the most scientifically\r\nrewarding mission in the unmanned space program. The Io pictures this\r\nmorning were truly spectacular and the atmosphere up in the imaging area\r\nwas punctuated by whoops of joy or amazement or both.” The new color\r\nphoto of Io taken the night before was released, showing strange surface\r\nfeatures in tones of yellow, orange, and white. The image defied\r\ndescription; the Imaging Team used terms like “grotesque,” “diseased,”\r\n“gross,” “bizarre.” Smith introduced the picture with the comment, “Io\r\nlooks better than a lot of pizzas I’ve seen.” Larry Soderblom added,\r\n“Well, you may recall [that we] told you yesterday that when we flew by\r\nwe’d figure all this out. I hope you didn’t believe it.”\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain: There were no impact craters on Io. Unless the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter had somehow been shielded from the meteoric\r\nimpacts that cratered objects such as the Moon, Mars, and Mercury, the\r\nabsence of craters must indicate the presence of erosion or of internal\r\nprocesses that destroy or cover up craters. Io did not look like a dead\r\nplanet. Imaging Team member Hal Masursky, looking at the “pizza”\r\npicture, estimated that the surface of Io must be no more than 100\r\nmillion years old—that is, some agent must have erased impact craters\r\nduring the last 100 million years. This interpretation depended on how\r\noften cratering impacts occur on Io. No one could be sure that there had\r\nbeen any interplanetary debris in the Jovian system to impact the\r\nsurfaces of the satellites. Perhaps none of them would be cratered. The\r\nforthcoming flybys of Ganymede and Callisto would soon provide this\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The giant volcanic feature Pele, about 1000\r\n    kilometers across, mystified Voyager scientists when this picture of\r\n    Io was taken on March 5 from a distance of about 400 000 kilometers.\r\n    The brilliant colors, the strange shapes of the surface deposits,\r\n    and the absence of impact craters all testified that Io was unlike\r\n    any world previously encountered in the exploration of the solar\r\n    system. [P-21226C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: As Voyager 1 approached Io, the images of the surface\r\n    became more and more spectacular. On the morning of March 5, at a\r\n    range of 130 000 kilometers, this picture was taken centered near\r\n    longitude 320° and latitude 10°S. The width of the picture is about\r\n    1000 kilometers (the distance from the Mexican border to the\r\n    northern edge of California). There are no impact craters,\r\n    signifying a geologically young surface, and the dark center with\r\n    radiating red flows indicates recent volcanic activity of some sort.\r\n    [P-21277C]]\r\n\r\nThe close flyby of Ganymede took place at 6:53 p.m., at a range of 115\r\n000 kilometers. During the preceding four hours, photos revealed a\r\nsurface covered with impact craters. Watching these photos and supplying\r\ncommentary for the television listeners, David Morrison remarked, “While\r\nI’m delighted to see craters, it’s just the opposite of what I would\r\nhave expected. I was telling everyone a few days ago that I thought Io\r\nwould have plenty of craters and that Ganymede, because of the ice\r\nsurface, simply would not be able to hold large craters over geological\r\ntime. So this is fascinating and this is confusing—both what has\r\nhappened on Io to erase the craters and why Ganymede’s surface is strong\r\nenough to preserve them.”\r\n\r\nJust before closest approach, at 6:35 p.m., the ultraviolet instrument\r\nwatched as a bright star passed behind Ganymede and reemerged ten\r\nminutes later. No dimming that could be attributed to an atmosphere was\r\nseen; when the data were analyzed later, scientists set an upper limit\r\nfor any gas on this satellite at one-billionth of the atmospheric\r\npressure at the surface of the Earth.\r\n\r\nAs encounter day drew to a close, celebrations took place all over JPL.\r\nFor many, however, the excitement was tempered by exhaustion. After 48\r\nhours of intense activity, sleep was imperative for some. But the close\r\napproach to Callisto was still to come, as was an examination of the\r\ndata already received.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: After its close flyby of Io, Voyager 1 headed for\r\n    Ganymede, the largest of the Galilean satellites. This global view\r\n    of Ganymede, taken on March 4 at a range of 2.6 million kilometers,\r\n    shows features as small as 50 kilometers across. At the time,\r\n    Voyager scientists speculated that the numerous white spots were\r\n    impact craters, surrounded in some cases by icy ejecta blankets\r\n    splashed onto the surrounding surface. However, many narrow white\r\n    streaks, especially those in the lower left quadrant, promised new\r\n    and exciting geological features on this satellite. [P-21207C]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Tuesday, March 6.\r\n\r\nVoyager was now receding from Jupiter, accelerated on a new\r\ntrajectory—one that would speed it on toward its November 1980 encounter\r\nwith Saturn. But first came the encounter with Callisto, with closest\r\napproach at 9:50 a.m., at a range of 126 000 kilometers. The satellite\r\nwas littered with craters and there appeared one huge “bullseye” pattern\r\nthat might have been the result of an impact. As the photos of Callisto\r\ncame in, Garry Hunt described the scene in the imaging area: “The\r\nactivity around the monitors now is quite incredible with people caught\r\nbreathless by the pictures coming in. Every satellite we’ve seen has\r\nbeen a different world.” Asked how he felt about the images of Jupiter’s\r\natmosphere, he replied, “I’m absolutely delighted with what I’ve seen,\r\nand I’m delighted Voyager 2 is not far behind since I’m convinced that\r\nwe’ll see yet another face of Jupiter by then. The weather will have\r\nchanged by July.”\r\n\r\nAt the morning press briefing, the wealth of new data began to be\r\nrevealed. “If Jupiter had ever posed for Monet, it would probably have\r\nturned out like this,” said Brad Smith as he introduced some enhanced\r\n(exaggerated) color images that had been specially processed to show\r\nmore detail in the Great Red Spot region. Indeed, these photographs did\r\nlook like paintings with Jupiter displaying some of its best abstract\r\nart.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: As Voyager 1 approached Ganymede on March 5, many\r\n    strange new surface features became visible. In this frame, taken\r\n    from a distance of 250 000 kilometers and showing features as small\r\n    as 5 kilometers across, three distinct types of terrain are seen:\r\n    polygons of old dark surface, extensive areas of lighter, younger\r\n    material, and brilliant white ejecta patterns (probably water-ice)\r\n    around fresh craters. The bright rays in the upper part of the\r\n    picture are 300-500 kilometers long; at the bottom are several\r\n    craters with only faint, muted ejecta patterns. [P-21262C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager 1 found that the surface of Ganymede was\r\n    geologically very complex. This frame, taken March 5 from a range of\r\n    250 000 kilometers, shows a region about 1000 kilometers across\r\n    centered near longitude 0° and latitude 20°S. The surface displays\r\n    many craters, some (probably the younger ones) with bright ray\r\n    systems. Bright grooved bands traverse the surface in various\r\n    directions. One of these bands, running in a north-south direction\r\n    in the lower left of the picture, is offset along a white line that\r\n    may represent a fault. Ganymede is the only Galilean satellite to\r\n    show indications of such lateral offsets in the crust. [P-21266]]\r\n\r\nThe first picture of Amalthea was shown, revealing an elongated, dark,\r\nreddish object about 265 kilometers long. Smith reported: “There is\r\nactually some structure that one can see—a crater—a couple of bright\r\nfeatures for which we have no interpretation and some other evidence of\r\ncratering. It doesn’t look like much, but after all, Amalthea has never\r\nbeen seen as anything more than a point of light from the Earth, and, in\r\nfact, there are very few people that have even seen it as a point of\r\nlight. I doubt that more than one astronomer out of a hundred has\r\nactually seen Amalthea.”\r\n\r\nLarry Soderblom introduced new photographs of the satellites. Io still\r\nshowed no craters, even at high resolution. The craters that “should”\r\nhave been on Io were on Ganymede and Callisto. Ganymede not only had\r\ncraters, it had fault lines as well. “There is transverse motion along\r\nthese faults. Things get offset, apparently, for hundreds of kilometers.\r\nSo it’s the first time we’ve seen major kinds of transverse motion on\r\nthe surface of another planet.” Ganymede, in effect, had shown evidence\r\nof having its own icy version of the San Andreas Fault.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Amalthea was thought to be the innermost satellite of\r\n    Jupiter until Voyager 2 discovered tiny Adrastea (1979J1). The\r\n    Voyager 1 camera revealed Amalthea as an irregular dark reddish\r\n    object with dimensions of 270 × 160 kilometers. These three images\r\n    have resolutions of (b) 25 kilometers; (c) 13 kilometers; (d) 8\r\n    kilometers. [260-503]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Observation geometry for Amalthea]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (b)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (c)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (d)]\r\n\r\nAlthough Callisto was heavily covered with craters up to 200 kilometers\r\nin diameter, Dr. Soderblom commented on the absence of larger impact\r\nbasins. Perhaps there was one in the huge bullseye feature; however, it\r\nwas not a “standard” looking basin like those on the Moon. Callisto was\r\n“extremely smooth and free of any relief. The structure [the bullseye],\r\nif impact caused, shows no relief; the limb does not show any relief;\r\nmaybe it’s possible that Callisto cannot support relief.” By the next\r\nday, the geologists on the Imaging Team were becoming more convinced\r\nthat the Callisto “bullseye” was the frozen remnant of an enormous\r\nimpact into Callisto’s surface. Since Callisto is composed in large part\r\nof water and has an icy crust, the team speculated that any raised\r\nfeatures created by the impact would eventually “slide” back into the\r\nsurface, “and the ripple marks from the shock wave caused by the impact\r\nwere frozen” into the surface.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Callisto was the last of the Galilean satellites to\r\n    be studied by Voyager 1. In this photo, taken March 5 from a\r\n    distance of 1.2 million kilometers, with a resolution of about 25\r\n    kilometers, the extensive cratering of the surface began to be\r\n    apparent. Near the upper left edge is the large impact basin\r\n    Valhalla; the numerous light spots are craters 100 kilometers or\r\n    more in diameter. This is the same side of Callisto that was\r\n    photographed at higher resolution during the Voyager 1 flyby of the\r\n    satellite a day later. [P-21284C]]\r\n\r\nLyle Broadfoot announced that the ultraviolet spectrometer had detected\r\nvery strong auroral emission in Jupiter’s north and south polar regions.\r\nThe aurora seemed to be caused primarily by the excitation of molecular\r\nhydrogen, although some atomic hydrogen was also detected. Auroral\r\nemissions from helium atoms were not detected.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The largest ancient impact basin on Callisto is\r\n    called Valhalla. The central light area is about 600 kilometers\r\n    across. Surrounding it is a set of concentric low ridges, looking\r\n    like frozen ripple marks, extending about 1500 kilometers from the\r\n    center. This picture was taken by Voyager 1 on March 6 at a range of\r\n    350 000 kilometers. [P-21287C]]\r\n\r\nThe IRIS infrared measurements required more computer processing than\r\nother Voyager data, and therefore they were not available until a day or\r\ntwo after the observations were made. However, Rudy Hanel already had\r\ntwo new results to report. First, the Great Red Spot was about 3° C\r\ncooler than its surroundings, and this cooling extended many kilometers\r\nabove the clouds, into the thin upper atmosphere. Second, the thermal\r\nemission from Io was peculiar, with an unexpected shape to the spectrum.\r\nTentatively, Hanel suggested there might be some hot spots on the\r\nsurface of the satellite.\r\n\r\nJupiter has been full of surprises, but the excitement was far from\r\nover. Major discoveries were yet to be made.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager 1 discovered the rings of Jupiter on March 4\r\n    in a single eleven-minute exposure with the narrow-angle camera.\r\n    Spacecraft motion during the time exposure streaked the picture, as\r\n    can be seen from the hairpin-like images of the stars. (The star\r\n    field was unusually rich, since it happened to include the Beehive\r\n    star cluster in Cancer.) The ring image itself is a multiple\r\n    exposure, with six separate images side by side. The ring does not\r\n    extend out of the right side of the picture, indicating that this\r\n    image captured the outer edge of the ring, about halfway between the\r\n    cloud tops and the orbit of Amalthea. [P-21258]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Camera with fields of view]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Wednesday, March 7.\r\n\r\nAt the press briefing, Brad Smith made a spectacular announcement: “This\r\nmorning I would like to add yet another important discovery to be\r\nclaimed by this outstanding mission—that of a thin flat ring of\r\nparticles surrounding Jupiter. Thus Jupiter now joins Saturn and Uranus\r\nto become the third planet of our solar system known to possess a\r\nplanetary ring system and leaves Neptune as the only member of the group\r\nof giant planets without a known ring. The discovery of the ring was\r\nunexpected in that the current theory which treats long-term stability\r\nof planetary rings would not predict the existence of such a ring around\r\nJupiter. The single Voyager camera image which recorded the ring was\r\nplanned by the Voyager Imaging Team several years ago, not really with\r\nany great expectation of a positive result, but more for the purpose of\r\nproviding a degree of completeness to Voyager’s survey of the entire\r\nJupiter system. The observation, as planned, involved looking off to the\r\nright of the limb of Jupiter in the planet’s equatorial plane at the\r\nexact moment that the spacecraft would be crossing the equatorial plane.\r\nThe image actually was taken at 16 hours and 52 minutes before encounter\r\nfrom a distance of about 1.2 million kilometers. Exposure time was 11.2\r\nminutes. We weren’t certain of the exact moment that we would cross the\r\nequatorial plane, so we planned to open our shutter and leave it open as\r\nwe went through.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Since the Voyager 1 ring photograph was taken exactly\r\n    edge-on, it was not possible to determine the width of the ring. In\r\n    this artist’s conception, the ring is drawn as if it were\r\n    ribbon-like, with very little width, quite unlike the broad flat\r\n    rings of Saturn. Voyager 2 later showed this to have been a lucky\r\n    guess. [P-21259]]\r\n\r\nThe image showed six exposures of the ring, together with streaked\r\ntrails of background stars. Smith reported that the thickness of the\r\nring was less than 30 kilometers, and that it extended to a point 128\r\n000 kilometers from the center of Jupiter, or 57 000 kilometers above\r\nthe clouds. In response to this discovery, scientists were eagerly\r\nplanning to alter the Voyager 2 encounter sequence to try to obtain\r\nadditional information on the ring.\r\n\r\nThe newspapers carried stories of the ring discovery on Thursday, March\r\n8. One story was seen by two University of Hawaii astronomers, Eric\r\nBecklin and Gareth Wynn-Williams, who were observing at Mauna Kea\r\nObservatory, at an altitude of 4200 meters on the Big Island of Hawaii.\r\nWithin two days they had succeeded in detecting the rings by their\r\nreflected sunlight, at an infrared wavelength of 2.2 micrometers,\r\nproviding a rapid confirmation of the Voyager discovery.\r\n\r\nAs the plasma measurements from the Io flyby were analyzed, an\r\nadditional clue to the origin of sulfur and oxygen was revealed. Herb\r\nBridge reported the detection of sulfur dioxide (SO₂), the simplest\r\nmolecule composed of these two atoms.\r\n\r\nThe high-resolution tape-recorded pictures of Io baffled imaging\r\nscientists. A number of features looked like volcanic flows; together\r\nwith the absence of impact craters, these features indicated a\r\ngeologically active planet. A central point of discussion was the recent\r\ntheoretical work on Io by Stanton Peale of the University of California\r\nand two NASA scientists, Pat Cassen and Ray Reynolds. These authors had\r\njust published a paper in the March 2 issue of _Science_ showing how\r\ntidal heating from Jupiter’s gravity could melt the interior of Io. They\r\nwrote that “widespread and recurrent surface volcanism might occur.” It\r\nbegan to look as if the prediction had been correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Thursday, March 8.\r\n\r\nThe last Voyager 1 press briefing was held. Each speaker was allotted\r\nonly a few minutes, prompting Larry Soderblom to preface his remarks by\r\ntrying to explain how difficult it was to describe four new planets—the\r\nGalilean satellites—in the time allowed. “Torrence [Johnson] was sitting\r\nwith me last night, puzzling. He said, ‘You know, Larry, it’s sort of\r\nlike imagining we’d flown into the solar system the day before\r\nyesterday, and said, “There’s a thing we’ll call Mercury, and there’s\r\nthe Moon, and there’s Earth, and there’s Mars. Now let’s explain them in\r\nten minutes”.’” There was Callisto, with the highest density of craters\r\nof any Galilean satellite—the oldest of the Galilean surfaces—featuring\r\na huge “bullseye” that is “the largest single contiguous feature seen so\r\nfar in the solar system.” There was Ganymede, cratered, but also overrun\r\nwith fault lines that looked, according to one person, like “tire tracks\r\nin the desert,” showing a surface that “had laterally slid—faulted and\r\nsheared and sheared again—twisted and torn apart.” There was Io, the\r\nmost bizarre—the one that scientists had thought would be most\r\nlunarlike—showing a surface that had apparently been “cooked and steamed\r\nand fumed out leaving deposits all over the surface much like you might\r\nsee around a fumarole at Yellowstone National Park. The fact that these\r\nthings exhibit such youth makes it likely that the planet is still\r\nvolcanically active.” There was Europa, with huge linear features unlike\r\nthose of the other three Galileans—Europa the mystery satellite, waiting\r\nfor the probing eyes of Voyager 2 to survey it in early July.\r\n\r\nEd Stone summed it all up: “I think we have had almost a decade’s worth\r\nof discovery in this two-week period, and I think that all of the people\r\nwho have been talking to you feel the same saturation of new information\r\nwhich has occurred. And in fact, we will probably be studying it in\r\ngreat detail for at least five years.”\r\n\r\nOver the next day or so the press packed up and went home. The TV\r\nmonitors showed the spacecraft’s parting glance at a crescent Jupiter,\r\nonly hinting at the vastness of space Voyager 1 would travel until its\r\nencounter with Saturn in the autumn of 1980. Maybe now there would be a\r\nrelative calm that would allow the scientists to begin analyzing that\r\n“decade’s worth of data.” But things were not to be calm just yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Fire and Brimstone\r\n\r\nAt about 5 a.m. on March 8, Voyager had taken a historic picture.\r\nLooking back at a crescent Io from a distance of 4.5 million kilometers,\r\nthe camera had been used to obtain a long-exposure view for the\r\nspacecraft navigation team—one that showed the satellite against the\r\nfield of background stars. During the day, Linda Morabito, an optical\r\nnavigation engineer, began to work with this picture on her\r\ncomputer-controlled image display. She noted what appeared to be a\r\ncrescent cloud, extending beyond the edge of Io. But Io has no\r\natmosphere, so a cloud rising hundreds of kilometers above the surface\r\ndid not seem to make sense.\r\n\r\nThe next day, working with her colleagues, Morabito eliminated all\r\npossibilities for the new feature on Io except the obvious—a cloud. If\r\nit were a cloud, it must be the result of an ongoing volcanic eruption\r\nof incredible violence. The picture was shown to members of the Imaging\r\nTeam, who agreed with the identification. But it was Friday and Brad\r\nSmith and Larry Soderblom, along with most of the other team members,\r\nhad left for the weekend to try to get some rest.

At the terminator,\r\n    the border between day and night on Io, a second smaller cloud from\r\n    the volcano Loki (P₂) catches the sunlight. These two\r\n    eruptions—captured on this single discovery photograph—are much\r\n    larger than the largest terrestrial volcanic eruption known.\r\n    [P-21306 B/W]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Once the existence of giant volcanic eruptions on Io\r\n    was recognized, a reexamination of the Voyager 1 encounter pictures\r\n    revealed many more plumes.

The plume\r\n    itself rose more than 100 kilometers above Io’s surface. [P-21294]]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, new information about Jupiter was released to the public. A\r\nlong-exposure (three minutes and twelve seconds) image of the dark side\r\nof the planet, taken with the wide-angle camera while in the shadow of\r\nthe planet, caught Jupiter showing off some Jovian “fireworks.” A long,\r\nbroad, white streak across the picture was a visible aurora, the largest\r\naurora ever seen—almost 29 000 kilometers long. In addition, nineteen\r\nsmaller bright splotches, looking insignificant by comparison, were in\r\nreality “superbolts” of lightning. Since huge electrical discharges such\r\nas lightning can, under the right circumstances, power chemical\r\nreactions that form complex organic molecules, the discovery of\r\nlightning on Jupiter could have profound implications. Was\r\n“lightning-inspired” organic synthesis going on in Jupiter’s atmosphere?\r\nNo one knew.\r\n\r\nReturning to JPL on Sunday night, Brad Smith got his first look at the\r\nMorabito picture of the volcanic cloud. Early Monday morning, other\r\nImaging Team scientists saw it. As soon as the JPL computers were\r\noperating, Joseph Veverka and Robert Strom began working with the two\r\ninteractive TV terminals to look for evidence in other pictures of\r\nongoing eruptions. Faint clouds or plumes would not show up in normally\r\nprocessed pictures, but could be brought out easily with the\r\ncomputer-controlled displays. By midmorning, several additional volcanic\r\nplumes had been found.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Linda Morabito shows the discovery photo of the\r\n    volcanic eruptions on Io. [P-21718]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The dark side of Jupiter revealed many surprising\r\n    phenomena to Voyager 1. A wide-angle view, taken on March 5, led to\r\n    the discovery of a double auroral arc at north-polar latitudes and\r\n    numerous flashes of lightning illuminating the clouds during this\r\n    3-minute, 12-second exposure, taken at a range of half a million\r\n    kilometers. [260-460]]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on March 11, John Pearl of the IRIS team had independently\r\ndrawn the conclusion that volcanic activity must be taking place on Io.\r\nHe and Rudy Hanel found evidence of strongly enhanced thermal emission\r\nfrom parts of the satellite. The most prominent was a source nearly 200°\r\nC hotter than its surroundings. On March 12, Pearl brought his new\r\nresults to the Imaging Team, and sure enough, the hot spot was located\r\nnear one of the volcanic plumes! A month later, continuing analysis of\r\nIRIS spectra yielded identification of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) gas over\r\nthis same erupting volcano. At last a source had been located for the\r\nenigmatic sulfur and oxygen ions in the magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nThe volcanoes provided a thread with which to weave together the\r\ndisparate data on Io. A few months earlier there had been a report of a\r\nsudden brightening of Io in the infrared; now it seemed plausible that\r\nthermal emission from an eruption was the source. The Voyager\r\nultraviolet experimenters had been worrying over the source of the\r\nintense sulfur emissions they had seen and had been disturbed by the\r\nchanges in the gas clouds around Io since the Pioneer 10 and 11 flybys;\r\nnow a variable source for these gas clouds was identified. In addition,\r\nthe craterfree surface and bizarre features seen in the Voyager images\r\ncould be recognized as the product of violent explosive eruptions on Io.\r\nIt appeared that Peale, Cassen, and Reynolds had found, in their\r\ntheoretical calculations, the key to the most geologically active body\r\never encountered in the solar system.\r\n\r\nNews of the discovery was released to the press on Monday, March 12.\r\nDuring the next few days, a total of eight gigantic eruptions were\r\nlocated in the Voyager pictures of Io. Within a few weeks, scientists\r\nall over the world were thinking with renewed energy about this\r\nincredible satellite.\r\n\r\nWith four new planet-sized satellites now photographed, there was a\r\nsudden requirement for maps and for names to be assigned to the newly\r\ndiscovered features. The maps were produced from Voyager images at the\r\nAstrogeology Branch of the U.S. Geological Survey at Flagstaff, Arizona.\r\nThe names, proposed by a group of scientists headed by Voyager Imaging\r\nTeam members Tobias Owen and Hal Masursky, were given official approval\r\nby the International Astronomical Union in August. For a time, a dual\r\nnomenclature persisted for the erupting volcanoes on Io. The eruption\r\nplumes were given numbers, P₁, P₂, etc., while the volcanic features\r\nwere given names taken from the mythology of fire and volcano legends.\r\nThus the “hoof print” of Io was called Pele, for the Hawaiian volcano\r\ngoddess, and the 280-kilometer-high plume associated with it was called\r\nP₁. By the time of the Voyager 2 encounter, scientists had prepared maps\r\non which to plot their new discoveries.\r\n\r\nWhile the Voyager scientists fanned out across the world to share their\r\nfindings with colleagues, attention at JPL turned to Voyager 2. In\r\nresponse to the discoveries of the first encounter, changes were\r\nrequired in the sequencing of scientific observations for July. Voyager\r\n2, still troubled by a faulty receiver, might require more coddling from\r\nthe spacecraft team than had its sister spacecraft, now safely on the\r\nway to Saturn.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The particles of the rings of Jupiter are stronger\r\n    reflectors of red light than of blue, as can be seen in this view,\r\n    assembled from two images taken in orange and violet light. Since\r\n    the images were registered on the rings, not the planet, the bright\r\n    bands of colors along the edge of Jupiter are an artifact of\r\n    misalignment.

The scientists had come days or weeks earlier to\r\nlook at data being transmitted from the second Voyager as it approached\r\nJupiter and its satellites. The mood at JPL seemed quieter than it had\r\nbeen in March for Voyager 1, although the press room would once again be\r\ndeluged with observers on the day of encounter. This would be our second\r\ngood, close look at the Jovian system, but it was to be no summer rerun.\r\nVoyager 2 would have a different view of each world, and, in addition,\r\nboth Io and Jupiter had undergone changes, as though to ensure that no\r\none would become bored and fall asleep in front of a TV monitor. In a\r\nsense, this encounter was to be another first look at Jupiter and its\r\nsatellites, with a view of each object that was quite different from\r\nwhat had been seen before.\r\n\r\nChanges in Jupiter’s cloud formations became noticeable long before\r\nJuly. After a gap of six weeks following the first flyby, Voyager 2’s\r\nobservatory phase began on April 24, 1979, seventy-six days before its\r\nJuly 9 encounter with Jupiter. During this time, the spacecraft’s\r\nultraviolet and fields and particles instruments studied the Jovian\r\nsystem and its interaction with the solar wind. Between April 24 and May\r\n27, Voyager 2’s imaging system concentrated on the motions in Jupiter’s\r\natmosphere, creating another approach time-lapse “movie.” From May 27 to\r\n29 photographs were taken in a more rapid sequence, showing the planet\r\nduring five 10-hour rotations. From these studies it was apparent that\r\nGarry Hunt’s prediction had been right—the weather _had_ changed by\r\nJuly. A month before the encounter JPL’s Voyager Bulletin—Mission Status\r\nReport announced that “Jupiter is sporting quite a different face than\r\nit did just four months ago. The bright ‘tongue’ extending upward from\r\nthe Red Spot is interacting with a thin, bright cloud above it that has\r\ntraveled twice around Jupiter in four months.” The turbulent region west\r\nof the Great Red Spot had begun to break up and separate from the Red\r\nSpot. The white ovals south of the Red Spot had drifted to the east\r\n(about 0.35 degrees a day), while the Red Spot itself had drifted west\r\n(about 0.26 degrees a day). The white zone seen just south of the Red\r\nSpot by Voyager 1 had become very narrow—like a thin white line just\r\nbarely outlining the bottom of the spot. The Red Spot had also changed:\r\nIt had become a more uniform orange-red, perhaps reverting to the color\r\nseen by Pioneers 10 and 11. The brown spots that had been seen in the\r\nnorth temperate region at the same longitude as the Red Spot were now on\r\nthe other side of the planet. A dark brown spot not present during the\r\nVoyager 1 flyby had developed along the northern edge of the brown\r\nequatorial region on the Red Spot side of the planet. Some of the white\r\nmarkings that seemed to have protruded into the equatorial region at the\r\ntime of the first flyby were missing in the Voyager 2 photographs.\r\n\r\nAs Voyager 2 entered the far encounter period on May 29, all instruments\r\non the spacecraft (except for the photopolarimeter) seemed to be in good\r\nshape for encounter. As was the case with Voyager 1, the polarization\r\nwheel on Voyager 2’s photopolarimeter was stuck, so the instrument was\r\nable to obtain only color photometry measurements.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: In early June, as Voyager 2 carried out its\r\n    observatory phase, additional changes in Jupiter’s face began to be\r\n    apparent.

[P-21753C]]\r\n\r\nAlthough Voyager 2’s radio receiver still could not track a\r\nDoppler-shifted radio signal from Earth (the problem is that it “hears a\r\nmonotone,” explained Deputy Project Manager Esker K. Davis), the Deep\r\nSpace Network engineers had learned to work with the spacecraft,\r\ndetermining what frequency the spacecraft would listen to at any\r\nparticular time. They had discovered that some of the “housekeeping”\r\ntelemetry signals from the receiver were sensitive to the match between\r\nthe incoming frequency and the receiver frequency. By monitoring these\r\nsignals, they could detect a frequency drift in time to correct the\r\ntransmission, thus keeping the system in tune in spite of slow changes\r\nin the receiver. The system was slow and demanding but effective; all\r\nthe necessary command sequences were successfully loaded into the\r\ncomputer, and communications during the encounter were entirely\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe timing offset experienced by Voyager 1 as a result of Jupiter’s\r\nintense radiation environment was not expected to be a problem on\r\nVoyager 2 for two reasons: Even at closest approach, Voyager 2 would\r\nstill be more than twice as far from Jupiter as Voyager 1 had been, and\r\nthe Voyager 2 computer was programmed to resynchronize the spacecraft’s\r\ntiming systems automatically every hour. In this way, even if the\r\nradiation environment proved to be much higher than anticipated, the\r\nimage smear that might occur from a timing offset would be prevented.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Complex activity in the southern hemisphere of\r\n    Jupiter continued during the Voyager 2 encounter, although changes\r\n    had occurred in the region of the Great Red Spot. A white oval,\r\n    different from the one observed in a similar position at the time of\r\n    the Voyager 1 encounter, was situated south of the Red Spot. The\r\n    region of white clouds extended from east of the Red Spot and around\r\n    its northern boundary, preventing small cloud vortices from circling\r\n    the feature. The disturbed region west of the Red Spot had also\r\n    changed since the equivalent Voyager 1 image. The picture was taken\r\n    on July 3 from a distance of 6 million kilometers. [P-21742C]]\r\n\r\nAs a result of the discoveries made by Voyager 1, the project scientists\r\ndecided to modify some of Voyager 2’s preplanned sequences. As early as\r\nApril 1, the painstaking job of constructing new computer commands\r\nbegan. A ten-hour Io Volcano Watch was added to the spacecraft’s\r\nprogram, taking advantage of the fact that shortly after closest\r\napproach to Jupiter, the spacecraft would remain within about 1 million\r\nkilometers of Io for a long period, keeping nearly the same face in\r\nview. Provisions were also made to take extensive ultraviolet\r\nmeasurements of the emission from the glowing torus surrounding Jupiter\r\nnear the orbit of Io. Further studies would be made of the dark side of\r\nJupiter to search for lightning and auroral activity, and there was also\r\nthe hope that the plasma wave instrument would be able to detect\r\nlightning whistlers (radio signals created by lightning bolts) as the\r\nVoyager 1 instrument had done. A high priority was given to observations\r\nof the newly discovered ring, which had not been in the original Voyager\r\n2 sequence at all. The spacecraft would cross the ring plane twice,\r\nphotographing the ring during both the inbound and the outbound\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nAs was originally planned, Voyager 2 would make its closest approaches\r\nto Callisto, Ganymede, Europa, and Amalthea before encounter with\r\nJupiter. Because of the difference in the trajectories of the two\r\nspacecraft, Voyager 2 would see the faces of Callisto and Ganymede not\r\nseen by Voyager 1. The most important difference, however, was that the\r\nsecond Voyager would fly much closer to Europa than Voyager 1 did,\r\ngiving scientists their first good look at the mysterious streaks\r\nscratched on the surface of that bright golden world. Voyager 2 would\r\nalso have a closer flyby of Ganymede, giving us a second chance to\r\nexamine its strange “snowmobile tracks.” The major loss, of course, was\r\nIo, which would be seen from Voyager 2 only at distances of a million\r\nkilometers or more.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Io appeared in front of Jupiter as seen by Voyager on\r\n    June 25, at a range of 12 million kilometers. At a resolution of\r\n    about 200 kilometers, the bright and dark spots on the satellite are\r\n    just beginning to be resolved, but it was not possible to determine\r\n    if any eruptions were still in progress. [P-21719C]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The Encounter\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Wednesday, July 4.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 5.3 million kilometers; range to Earth, 921 million\r\nkilometers_). While most of the nation celebrated Independence Day with\r\npicnics, sports events, and fireworks, the scientists and engineers at\r\nJPL were working around the clock. Voyager 2 had already entered\r\nJupiter’s territory, crossing the bow shock for the first time on July 2\r\nat a distance of 99 R_J from Jupiter, indicating that the magnetosphere\r\nhad expanded in the interval between the two encounters. At about noon\r\non July 3, the spacecraft encountered the magnetopause, but on July 4,\r\nthe data from the particles and fields instruments were ambiguous.\r\nApparently the magnetosphere was pulsating in response to changing\r\npressures, and the spacecraft was playing tag with the rapidly shifting\r\nboundaries of the bow shock and the magnetopause.\r\n\r\nAs the low energy charged particle instrument began to measure particles\r\ncoming from inside the Jovian magnetosphere, it became apparent that\r\nsome important changes had taken place since Voyager 1’s encounter. From\r\nthe composition of the particles, it appeared that they were largely of\r\nsolar origin, unlike the heavy concentrations of ions of sulfur and\r\noxygen seen by Voyager 1. Scientists began to speculate that the Io\r\nvolcanoes, which presumably eject sulfur and oxygen into the\r\nmagnetosphere, might have declined in activity. In the evening, the\r\nfirst images of Io at a resolution high enough to allow the volcanic\r\nplumes to be seen would be beamed back to Earth.\r\n\r\n                  ENCOUNTER DISTANCES FOR VOYAGER 2\r\n     Object      Range to Center at Closest   Best Image Resolution\r\n                    Approach (kilometers)       (km per line pair)\r\n\r\n  Jupiter                            722 000                      15\r\n  Amalthea                           558 000                      10\r\n  Io                               1 130 000                      20\r\n  Europa                             206 000                       4\r\n  Ganymede                            62 000                       1\r\n  Callisto                           215 000                       4\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager scientists anxiously awaited the first views\r\n    of Io that would show whether the volcanic eruptions seen in March\r\n    were still active.

The press room at Von\r\nKarman Auditorium opened and the members of the press, most of them\r\nveterans of the first encounter, arrived at JPL. Meanwhile, the\r\nspacecraft continued to measure fluctuations in the magnetospheric\r\nboundary. By noon, JPL had reported at least eleven crossings of the bow\r\nshock as the solar wind flirted with Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Apparently\r\nthe solar wind was much more variable in July than it had been in March.\r\nAt times the bow shock seemed to be thicker than that experienced by\r\nVoyager 1; one Voyager 2 crossing took ten minutes, whereas the longest\r\nVoyager 1 crossing was only one minute long. Even though the processes\r\naffecting the magnetosphere seemed more complex, the magnetosphere was\r\nless compressed; when Voyager 2 actually entered the magnetosphere at a\r\ndistance of 62 R_J, it was much farther from Jupiter than Voyager 1 had\r\nbeen at its final crossing (47 R_J).\r\n\r\nPhotos obtained the day before from over 4 million kilometers showed\r\nthat at least one of Io’s volcanoes was still active. A total of eight\r\nongoing eruptions had been seen by Voyager 1, and scientists were\r\nanxious to see how many of these were still erupting four months later.\r\n\r\n  VOYAGER 2 BOW SHOCK (S) AND MAGNETOPAUSE (M) CROSSINGS\r\n      Boundary            Day           Distance (R_J)\r\n                       _Inbound_\r\n\r\n         S                7/02          99  (multiple)\r\n         S                7/02          97\r\n         S                7/03          87\r\n         M                7/04          72  (multiple)\r\n         M                7/05          71\r\n         S                7/05          69\r\n         S                7/05          67\r\n         M                7/05          62\r\n\r\n                       _Outbound_\r\n\r\n         M                7/23         169\r\n         M                7/23         173\r\n         M                7/24         174\r\n         M                7/24         175\r\n         M                7/24         176\r\n         M                7/24         177\r\n         M                7/25         184\r\n         M                7/25         185\r\n         M                7/27         213\r\n         M                7/31         253\r\n         M                8/01         258\r\n         M                8/01         262  (multiple)\r\n         M                8/03         279  (multiple)\r\n         S                8/03         283  (multiple)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Although Voyager 2 did not come as close to Io as had\r\n    Voyager 1, some changes in the surface during the four months\r\n    between encounters were so large that they could still be easily\r\n    seen.

[260-687AC]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Volcano Pele on Io.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Volcano Pele on Io.]\r\n\r\nWhile attention at JPL focused on the unfolding drama of the Jupiter\r\nencounter, many members of the world’s press seemed more interested in\r\nthe fate of Skylab, which was nearing its death plunge into the Earth’s\r\natmosphere. Launched in 1973, Skylab had been one of NASA’s more\r\nsuccessful projects. Three crews of astronauts had visited it, carrying\r\nout intensive studies of the Sun and breaking one record after another\r\nfor the duration of manned space flight. Since the departure of the\r\nfinal group of three astronauts in 1974, Skylab had been sinking\r\ngradually lower as a result of friction with the extreme upper\r\natmosphere of Earth. During the past year, higher temperatures in the\r\natmosphere had increased this drag, and now the end was near. With a\r\nstrange fascination, the world watched the end of this old spacecraft,\r\nalmost seeming to forget the spectacular new results being transmitted\r\nfrom Jupiter. To the frustration of the Voyager team and the press\r\n“camped out” in Von Karman Auditorium for the second encounter, the\r\nexaggerated stories of a possible Skylab disaster took precedence over\r\nVoyager news. Ultimately, Skylab fell over the Indian Ocean and\r\nAustralia on Wednesday, July 11, just as the major findings of Voyager 2\r\nwere being released.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Friday, July 6.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 3.5 million kilometers_). With the first satellite\r\nencounter still two days away, Voyager 2 continued to make a variety of\r\nmeasurements of Jupiter and all the Galilean satellites. As the distance\r\nto Io decreased, it was possible to see detailed surface features as\r\nwell as to look for the volcanic plumes at the edge of the disk,\r\nsilhouetted against black space. By the end of the day, the Great Red\r\nSpot loomed so large that six imaging frames (a 2 × 3 mosaic) were\r\nrequired to encompass it and its immediate surroundings.\r\n\r\nAt the first formal press conference of the Voyager 2 encounter, Project\r\nScientist Ed Stone reviewed the progress of the mission. Because the\r\nailing spacecraft receiver was working so well, Ray Heacock, Voyager\r\nProject Manager, announced that the major trajectory correction maneuver\r\nat Jupiter had been rescheduled to take place only two hours after\r\nclosest approach. Since the geometry was especially favorable at this\r\ntime, the 76-minute rocket burn could put the spacecraft on its planned\r\nroute to Saturn with a minimum expenditure of fuel, thereby preserving\r\nthe option of sending the spacecraft on to Uranus.\r\n\r\nThe Io torus was under observation, both directly by the ultraviolet\r\nspectrometer, and indirectly by the charged particle instruments. The\r\nLECP instrument had begun to pick up sulfur ions, but at lower energies\r\nand lower concentrations than those recorded during the first encounter.\r\nIn the ultraviolet, glows could be seen both from the torus and from\r\naurorae in the polar regions of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nPhotographs of Io showed that the heart-shaped feature surrounding Pele\r\n(P₁), Io’s largest volcano, had changed shape. The indentation of the\r\nheart had disappeared, making the heart into an oval. Apparently a new\r\ndeposit of volcanic ejecta had blanketed the surface, altering its\r\ncolor. Perhaps an earlier obstruction in the volcanic vent, or the shape\r\nof the vent itself, had caused the area surrounding Pele to look\r\nheart-shaped. In any case, whatever had caused the indentation was now\r\ngone. At the same time, new photos failed to show a plume above Pele,\r\nand there was speculation that changes in this eruption might be related\r\nto the altered population of charged particles in the magnetosphere.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Voyager 2 pictures of Callisto looked remarkably\r\n    similar to those obtained of the other side of the satellite by\r\n    Voyager 1. Seen from a distance of 2.3 million kilometers, the large\r\n    craters (100 kilometers or more across) appear as light spots. No\r\n    new major impact features such as Valhalla, discovered by Voyager 1,\r\n    are visible on the hemisphere seen by Voyager 2. [P-21740C]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Saturday, July 7.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 2.6 million kilometers_). As the spacecraft rapidly\r\nclosed on Callisto, better and better photographs were taken of the\r\npreviously unseen hemisphere. As with the Voyager 1 observations,\r\nhowever, the main impression was one of heavy cratering, unrelieved by\r\nother geologic structures. Meanwhile, the coverage of Io had improved as\r\nthe satellite rotated to the point at which a census of the volcanic\r\neruptions seen in the first encounter began to emerge.\r\n\r\nAt the 11:00 a.m. press conference, Larry Soderblom announced that four\r\nof the volcanoes discovered by Voyager 1 had been looked at again by\r\nVoyager 2, and three of them—Prometheus (P₂), Loki (P₃), and Marduk\r\n(P₇)—were still active. However, there was no trace of volcanic activity\r\ncoming from Pele, the source of the largest plume seen by Voyager 1. P₁\r\nwas either greatly subdued or had turned off completely.\r\n\r\nDr. Soderblom also announced that Voyager 2 images had detected another\r\ngiant ring structure on Callisto, bringing the total to three, and there\r\nwere probably more. This particular ring feature was estimated to be\r\nabout 1500 kilometers across. It was also noted that although Callisto\r\ngenerally seemed to be saturated with shoulder-to-shoulder craters, the\r\ncrater density near the ring structures seemed to be lower.\r\n\r\nSaturday was a fairly quiet time for the scientists but not for the\r\nspacecraft or the spacecraft team. “We blocked out about 7½ hours,”\r\nexplained Michael Devirian, Ground Data Systems Development,\r\nIntegration, and Test Director, “in which we could send it a set of\r\ncommands and re-send it if necessary to make sure all close-encounter\r\ncommands were received by Voyager 2 until all the commands got through.\r\nThe whole thing went perfectly the first time.” So everything was “go”\r\nfor close encounter. The near encounter phase began at 6:36 p.m. PDT.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A new face of Ganymede was revealed to Voyager 2.\r\n    This image was taken July 7 from a distance of 1.2 million\r\n    kilometers and clearly shows the large dark area Regio Galileo, as\r\n    well as much of the lighter grooved terrain discovered by Voyager 1.\r\n    The bright spots are impact craters. This image also shows what\r\n    appear to be polar caps, extending down to about latitude 45° in\r\n    both the northern and southern hemispheres. [260-670]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Sunday, July 8.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter, 1.5 million kilometers_). At 2:30 a.m. the first\r\nlong-exposure sequence of ring pictures was taken, and at 3:00 a.m. the\r\nintensive period of the Callisto encounter began. Eighty high-resolution\r\nimages were obtained of the satellite, centered around closest approach\r\n(215 000 kilometers) at 6:13 a.m. Incoming photos showed some features\r\nthat looked like double-walled craters, but no more giant ring\r\nstructures were seen. It appeared that there was an asymmetry in the\r\ndistribution of large impact features over Callisto’s surface. “Callisto\r\nmay turn out to be the most heavily cratered body in the solar system,”\r\nTorrence Johnson remarked. Garry Hunt was to add later on, “There’s just\r\nnot room for another crater on that body—it’s totally full.”\r\n\r\nAt the press conference, Brad Smith confirmed the earlier finding that\r\nIo’s volcano Pele was quite dead—at least for now. Although P₄ had not\r\nyet been looked at, all other volcanoes discovered by Voyager 1 were\r\nstill active, but no new plumes had been found. However, new ultraviolet\r\nimages of P₂ (Loki) suggested that the eruption had increased in size.\r\n(In a later report, the imaging team announced that P₂ had increased in\r\nheight to 175 kilometers and had changed to a two-column plume.) The new\r\nphotographs of Jupiter’s ring showed it to be quite narrow and\r\nribbonlike, Dr. Smith announced. The artist’s drawing (released during\r\nthe Voyager 1 encounter), intended to show the outer edge of the ring,\r\nturned out to be a good representation of the actual ring, Dr. Smith\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThere seemed to be less high-speed sulfur and oxygen inside Jupiter’s\r\nmagnetosphere than there had been during the Voyager 1 encounter, George\r\nGloeckler announced. Voyager 2’s low energy charged particle instrument\r\nwas finding substantial amounts of carbon, silicon, magnesium, and other\r\nelements of solar origin, but the Io-associated elements were almost\r\ndepleted. The ultraviolet instrument had found as much glowing sulfur in\r\nIo’s torus as before, but less of it seemed to be raised to energies\r\nhigh enough to leave the torus and be detected elsewhere in the\r\nmagnetosphere.\r\n\r\nThere were other indications of Jupiter’s changing weather. In a Voyager\r\nreport Sunday evening, Garry Hunt remarked, “One very exciting\r\nobservation came the other day which caused major excitement down in the\r\nimaging area. We actually saw a white cloud starting to intrude across a\r\ndark barge [large brownish oval-shaped feature in Jupiter’s northern\r\nhemisphere]. Atmospheric scientists get very excited by that because\r\nthis is showing us how the colors layer themselves up—that white cloud\r\nis clearly above the dark brown. We’re desperately trying to understand\r\nthe relationship of colors on Jupiter.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The first close-up views of Europa were both exciting\r\n    and perplexing to Voyager scientists. The best Voyager 1 resolution\r\n    had been only about 30 kilometers, but the Voyager 2 trajectory\r\n    permitted a much closer flyby. These pictures, taken on July 9 at a\r\n    range of 240 000 kilometers, have a resolution of about 5\r\n    kilometers. The bright icy crust of Europa is covered with a\r\n    spectacular series of dark streaks, giving the satellite a cracked\r\n    appearance. In a few cases, narrower light lines run down the\r\n    centers of the dark streaks, which are typically a few tens of\r\n    kilometers in width. Very few, if any, impact craters are visible on\r\n    Europa. [P-21760C and P-21764C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Europa]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Monday, July 9.\r\n\r\n(_Range to Jupiter at encounter, 722 000 kilometers_). Encounter day!\r\nAnd not just one encounter, but a whole sequence: Ganymede, Europa,\r\nAmalthea, Jupiter, and Io. By early Sunday evening, a wealth of new data\r\non Ganymede was pouring in. Not only was this a side of the satellite\r\nnot seen before, but Voyager 2 would pass closer to Ganymede than had\r\nVoyager 1. Encounter took place at 1:06 a.m., at a range of 62 000\r\nkilometers. Between 9:00 p.m. Sunday night and 1:30 a.m. Monday morning\r\na total of 217 photos, plus infrared and ultraviolet spectra, were\r\nscheduled. Sixty-nine photos were sent back in real time; others were\r\nrecorded for playback later.\r\n\r\nAs the Ganymede pictures appeared on the TV screens, they revealed a\r\nworld of tremendous variety. Some regions were heavily cratered:\r\n“Ganymede looks like Mercury or the highlands of the moon,” one Voyager\r\nscientist remarked. Other parts of the surface, however, showed very\r\ndifferent features: long, parallel mountain ridges that looked like\r\ngrooves made with a giant’s rake; narrow, segmented lines; white ejecta\r\nblankets from impacts that looked like a dazzling, snow-covered\r\nlandscape. Some of the pictures suggested cracking and slipping of\r\nGanymede’s crust, while others showed what appeared to be remnants of\r\nancient terrain unaffected by subsequent intense geologic activity. Many\r\nof the highest resolution frames were not seen at this time; they were\r\nrecorded on the spacecraft for playback later.\r\n\r\nStarting at about 8 a.m., Earth began receiving the first closeup views\r\nof Europa. Europa “could be the most exciting satellite in the whole\r\nJovian system,” said Larry Soderblom, “because it’s sort of the\r\ntransition body between the solid silicate body, Io, and the ice balls,\r\nGanymede and Callisto.” The icy crust looked as though it “had been\r\nruptured all over—as though it was in pieces—just as though it had been\r\nbroken in place and left there.” At 11:43 a.m., closest approach took\r\nplace at a range of 206 000 kilometers. By this time the scientists were\r\ndazzled by what they had seen; some were calling Europa the most bizarre\r\nof all the Galilean satellites. In the Imaging Team viewing area, David\r\nMorrison compared Europa’s surface to “a cracked egg,” and Gene\r\nShoemaker said, “It looks like sea ice to me.” When someone commented\r\nthat the canal-like streaks were reminiscent of Mars, Torrence Johnson\r\nreplied, “It looks like some pictures of Mars I’ve seen, but only on the\r\nwalls of Lowell Observatory.” Another quipped, “Where is Percival\r\nLowell, now that we need him!”\r\n\r\nThere were to be two press conferences: one to present spacecraft and\r\nscientific results and one to celebrate the second successful flyby and\r\nto talk of new goals—Saturn, and perhaps Uranus.\r\n\r\nAt the first conference, Ed Stone began by discussing the radiation\r\nVoyager was experiencing. One of Jupiter’s surprises was that the\r\nradiation environment was greater than had been anticipated, and this\r\ncaused problems with the radio receiver. The receiver frequency was\r\nshifting “more rapidly than we had anticipated,” said Ray Heacock, “and\r\nwe have not been able to keep an uplink continuously with the\r\nspacecraft.” The solution was to keep sending up commands at different\r\nfrequencies until a frequency the spacecraft would accept was found.\r\nJust how bad were the radiation levels? Ed Stone commented, “The\r\npenetrating radiation at a given distance is more intense now at this\r\ndistance than it was when Voyager 1 flew by.” From a preliminary\r\nanalysis it seemed that, overall, Voyager 2 would still be subjected to\r\nlower radiation levels than Voyager 1 had been, but to higher levels\r\nthan had been expected. In addition, Voyager 2’s radio receiver was much\r\nmore sensitive. The higher than expected radiation intensity also led\r\nVoyager scientists to have the ultraviolet spectrometer shut off, since\r\nthat instrument was also quite sensitive to the radiation.\r\n\r\nThe fourth member of the Galilean satellites had finally been seen, and\r\nLarry Soderblom happily introduced Europa. “Well, some few months ago,\r\nbefore the Voyager 1 encounter, we thought we had some idea of what\r\nplanets were like—at least the planets in the inner solar system: Mars,\r\nMercury, the Moon, the Earth. And we’ve discovered many times over in\r\nthe last couple of months how narrow our vision really was. Included in\r\nthe Jovian collection of satellites are the oldest (Callisto), the\r\nyoungest (Io), the darkest (Amalthea), the brightest (Europa), the\r\nreddest (Amalthea and Io), the whitest (Europa), the most active (Io),\r\nand the least active (Callisto). Today we found the flattest (Europa).”\r\n\r\nIn spite of the appearance of a cracked or broken surface, Europa showed\r\nno topography at all. Toward the sunset line, where the low angle of\r\nillumination should reveal even low relief, “the surface disappears—as\r\nif it were the surface of a billiard ball.” It seemed clear that Europa\r\nhas much less relief than the other two icy satellites, Ganymede and\r\nCallisto. But why can’t Europa’s surface support relief? Perhaps Europa\r\nhas a thick ice mantle—on the order of 100 kilometers. If Europa is\r\naffected by tidal heating, then such an ice mantle might be “sort of\r\nsoft and slushy” rather than rigid as are the crusts of Ganymede and\r\nCallisto. “The fact that the surface of Europa cannot support relief of\r\nany substantial amount suggests that the surface must be soft.” But, Dr.\r\nSoderblom added, there does not appear to be much lateral motion or\r\nrotation causing the surface markings—they don’t seem to be\r\noffset—rather, “it’s as if Europa had been cracked, broken, by some\r\nprocess which crushed it like an eggshell and just left the pieces\r\nsitting there. Expansion and contraction of ice and water are a good way\r\nto crunch up the surface.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Regio Galileo is the largest remnant of the ancient,\r\n    heavily cratered crust of Ganymede. This Voyager 2 color\r\n    reconstruction was made from pictures taken at a range of 310 000\r\n    kilometers; the scene is about 1300 kilometers across. Numerous\r\n    craters, many with central peaks, are visible. The large bright\r\n    circular features have little relief and are probably the remnants\r\n    of old large craters that have been annealed by the flow of icy\r\n    near-surface material. The closely spaced, arcuate linear features\r\n    are analogous to features on Callisto, such as the “ripple” marks\r\n    surrounding the ancient impact feature Valhalla. [P-21761C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: At high resolution, the grooved terrain on Ganymede\r\n    shows a wonderful complexity. Surface features as small as 1\r\n    kilometer across can be seen in this mosaic of Voyager 2 images\r\n    taken July 9. The grooves are basically long, parallel mountain\r\n    ridges, 10 to 15 kilometers from crest to crest—about the same scale\r\n    as the Appalachian mountains in the Eastern United States. The\r\n    numerous impact craters superposed on the mountain ridges indicate\r\n    that they are old—probably formed several billion years ago.\r\n    [260-637]]\r\n\r\nThe other side of Ganymede presented quite a different face from the one\r\nVoyager 1 had seen. Here were the dark ancient cratered terrains, the\r\nshoulder-to-shoulder craters reminiscent of Callisto, and there was a\r\nhuge circular feature on Ganymede looking like the remnant of a\r\nCallisto-style ringed basin, preserved in the ancient, dark terrain. The\r\nvery large dark feature revealed by Voyager in the northern hemisphere\r\nwhich bears these impact scars was later named “Regio Galileo,” for the\r\ndiscoverer of the Galilean satellites. It was seen in the low-resolution\r\nPioneer 10 picture of Ganymede taken in 1973, but its nature was not\r\nunderstood. It is so large it has even been glimpsed on occasions of\r\nexceptionally stable “seeing” with ground-based telescopes.\r\n\r\n3:29 p.m. PDT—Jupiter Encounter! In the press room half a dozen cameras\r\nclicked in unison as the universal clock declared the Voyager 2 had made\r\nits closest approach to Jupiter—650 000 kilometers from the cloud tops,\r\nzipping by at about 73 000 kilometers per hour—neither as close nor as\r\nfast as Voyager 1. By the time of the special press conference at 4:30\r\np.m., everyone at JPL was in a party mood. Thomas A. Mutch, who had\r\nreplaced Noel Hinners as NASA Associate Administrator for Space Science,\r\nRobert Parks, and Rodney Mills were the speakers.\r\n\r\nThe Jovian system is a place of “incredible beauty and mystery. Jupiter\r\nhas been a nice place to go by, but we wouldn’t want to stop there—we’re\r\ngoing on to Saturn,” Rod Mills explained, and Bob Parks agreed.\r\n\r\nTim Mutch had a different perspective. “Although we have just heard\r\nJupiter somewhat downgraded in favor of Saturn, nonetheless what we have\r\nbeen witnessing, first in March and now, in July, is a truly\r\nrevolutionary journey of exploration. We have gone beyond the familiar\r\npart of the solar system to objects that are so exotic that their very\r\nexistence, at least as far as I’m concerned, was something I’d accepted\r\nintellectually, but didn’t really accept in an immediate sense. We’re\r\nstarting out in our own space program on a new stage of space\r\nexploration—on our own long journeys beyond the solar system to distant\r\nlands. We never like to think, or rather, it’s statistically unlikely,\r\nthat we’re at a turning point in history. But if you look back at\r\nhistory books, such events are clearly read into the record. And I\r\nsubmit to you that when the history books are written a hundred years\r\nfrom now, two hundred years from now, the historians are going to cite\r\nthis particular period of exploration as a turning point in our\r\ncultural, our scientific, our intellectual development.”\r\n\r\nAlthough everyone was already celebrating another successful mission,\r\nthe encounter was far from over. Data continued to come in; there was\r\nstill the ten-hour Io Volcano Watch, which had begun at 4:31 p.m.; there\r\nwere more observations of Jupiter, including scheduled ring observations\r\nand dark side searches for aurorae and lightning bolts. There was a lot\r\nof work and excitement yet to come. Jupiter had another surprise in\r\nstore for Voyager 2.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: During the 10-hour Io volcano watch on July 9, the\r\n    spacecraft kept nearly the same face of Io in view. Most of the\r\n    surface was turned away from the Sun, however, and only a thin\r\n    crescent could be seen, shrinking as the observations continued.\r\n    These four frames were all photographed with identical exposures\r\n    from a range of about 1 million kilometers. These images show\r\n    Amirani (P₅) and Maui (P₆) on the west edge, brightening as the Sun\r\n    illuminates them more nearly from behind.

The Io watch continued\r\nthrough the night. As time passed, the satellite rotated in the same\r\ndirection as the motion of the spacecraft, keeping nearly the same side\r\nin view. Because of this, a few volcanoes could be closely watched, but\r\nmost would be missed entirely. During the sequence, the illuminated\r\ncrescent steadily shrank, until at the end, volcanic plumes could be\r\nseen on both edges, one illuminated by the setting Sun, the other\r\nshining in the dawn light.\r\n\r\nAt the 11 a.m. press conference, Esker Davis announced that engineers\r\nhad lost contact with the spacecraft radio receiver Monday evening\r\n(probably due to Jupiter’s radiation) and had to “chase it around most\r\nof the night,” sending commands at various frequencies until they locked\r\non to the frequency the spacecraft would accept. The major trajectory\r\ncorrection maneuver, begun at about the same time contact with the\r\nreceiver was lost, was successful. The 76-minute thruster firing, done\r\nat periapsis instead of two weeks after encounter, enabled the\r\nspacecraft to get a bigger “boost” from Jupiter than was originally\r\nplanned, amounting to a fuel saving of about 10 kilograms of hydrazine,\r\nenough to preserve the option of going on from Saturn to Uranus.\r\n\r\nAndrew Ingersoll discussed some results of the analysis of the Jovian\r\natmosphere. “At first, Voyager seemed to do nothing but emphasize the\r\nchaos, not the order.” But, with the help of ground-based observations,\r\nReta Beebe found that there is a “regular alternation of eastward and\r\nwestward jets” underlying the seemingly chaotic visible features. “The\r\nturbulence we see in the visible clouds seems to be a minor side show,\r\nor a process without much energy or mass compared to the very great\r\nenergy and mass that might be moving around in the deep atmosphere.”\r\n\r\n“We’re continuing to operate in our panic mode to try to get pictures to\r\nthe press,” Brad Smith said as he introduced new photographs of the\r\nsatellites. In earlier photos, Ganymede had seemed to have two different\r\nkinds of terrain—an ancient, cratered, Callisto-like surface, and the\r\nstranger, grooved terrain—terrains that might be representative of two\r\nvery different types of major episodes in Ganymede’s history. The most\r\nrecent images showed a much more confused picture, with several\r\nadditional types of surface geology.\r\n\r\nAt the daily project science briefing, another interpretation was being\r\ndiscussed. Lyle Broadfoot reported that new measurements of the position\r\nof the ultraviolet aurora demonstrated that it was caused by charged\r\nparticles from the Io torus, not from the outer parts of the\r\nmagnetosphere. Apparently these plasma particles arise in the volcanic\r\neruptions, are trapped for a time in the torus, and then fall into the\r\npolar regions of Jupiter, where they excite auroral emissions. A\r\nterrestrial aurora, in contrast, is caused by particles that originate\r\nin the solar wind. Jim Sullivan of the plasma investigation estimated\r\nthat about two tons of material each second are fed from Io into the\r\nplasma torus. This plasma, driven by the rotation of the Jovian magnetic\r\nfield, appears to be able to supply the million-million watts of power\r\nradiated in the ultraviolet.\r\n\r\nBy 5:00 p.m. the excitement had died down; many of the scientists had\r\nparties to attend that evening, and some members of the press were\r\nplanning parties of their own. The schedule of spacecraft activities\r\nalso seemed to have slowed. There were dark-side observations planned to\r\nsearch for lightning and aurorae. There would be a few more ring\r\npictures—not too much to see on the monitors that night ... or so many\r\npeople thought. But a few people were waiting around, perhaps to catch a\r\nglimpse of lightning or auroral activity, or to wait for another look at\r\nJupiter’s faint ring.\r\n\r\nBetween 5:52 and 6:16 p.m., six long-exposure, wide-angle photographs of\r\nthe dark side of Jupiter had been scheduled to search for aurorae and\r\nlightning. The spacecraft was 1 450 000 kilometers from Jupiter and\r\nabout two degrees below the equatorial plane.\r\n\r\nShortly after 6 p.m., the first of these ring photographs appeared on\r\nthe TV monitors with unexpected brilliance. Taken in orange and violet\r\nlight, the images showed the outline of Jupiter and, protruding from it,\r\ntwo narrow lines—one reaching all the way to Jupiter’s limb, the other\r\nbroken off, apparently hidden by the shadow of the giant planet. Seen\r\nfrom the new perspective of the shadow of Jupiter, the tenuous rings\r\nwere remarkably clear. A sudden renewal of excitement surged through the\r\ndevotees remaining in the press room. About 6:15, Brad Smith came down\r\nto join the press to watch the remainder of this series of pictures come\r\nin. “Hey Brad, are you going to burn out the camera with the ring?”\r\nsomeone joked. “Well, the rings do forward scatter nicely, don’t they?”\r\nDr. Smith replied. As the wide-angle pictures were followed by\r\nnarrow-angle views, more and more detail became apparent. For the first\r\ntime, a definite width for the ring could be seen, and there was even a\r\nhint of additional material inside the main ring. All in all, Voyager\r\nhad provided one more splendid series of pictures before it took off for\r\nSaturn.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: From a vantage point 2.5 degrees above the ring\r\n    plane, Voyager 2 was able for the first time to determine the width\r\n    of Jupiter’s ring. This picture shows that the ring is ribbon-like\r\n    and only a few thousand kilometers wide, quite unlike the broad\r\n    rings of Saturn. [P-21757B/W]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Wednesday, July 11.\r\n\r\nJPL Public Information Officer Frank Bristow opened the 10 a.m. press\r\nconference with an announcement: “We’ll have the report from the Imaging\r\nTeam including the tremendous pictures that we received here last night\r\nof the Jupiter ring that excited the entire team.”\r\n\r\nBrad Smith showed the ring pictures. “As many of you who were here last\r\nnight know, we got some rather nice pictures of the ring of Jupiter.\r\nIt’s as though Voyager 2 was fearful that we might be becoming just a\r\nlittle bit apathetic after this series of marvelous discoveries and felt\r\nthat it had to dazzle us one more time before it left for Saturn. The\r\nrings appear very much brighter than we had expected them to be.” The\r\nouter ring is about 6500 kilometers wide. There is material inside the\r\nring. There is a rather sharp outer boundary and a somewhat diffuse\r\ninner region. “And it is now our belief that the material in the ring\r\ngoes all the way down to the surface of Jupiter.” There is a very narrow\r\nrelatively bright outer ring and an extremely faint inner ring that goes\r\nall the way down to Jupiter’s cloud tops.\r\n\r\nLarry Soderblom summarized the satellite data: With respect to the\r\nGalilean satellites, “We’re in a relatively high state of ignorance.”\r\n\r\nThe Io Volcano Watch images seemed to indicate that plume P₂ was now the\r\nhighest volcano on Io, since P₁ seemed to have become quiet. Io may be\r\nthe easiest Galilean satellite to try to understand, because we can\r\nactually see the geological processes that are shaping the planet. Io’s\r\n“twin,” Europa, seems to be where “our highest state of ignorance” lies.\r\n“The faint bright streaks which show some relief are evidently different\r\nfrom the diffuse dark bands which don’t seem to show topography, but the\r\nsimilarity of these forms [that both the light and dark markings are of\r\nplanetary scale] suggests that they must be related.”\r\n\r\nEd Stone speculated about the other two Galilean satellites. Ganymede\r\nand Callisto are essentially identical in size, mass, and probably\r\ncomposition. By examining them, we can perhaps learn what happens when\r\nbodies with very similar chemistry have different “life histories” and\r\ndifferent surface properties (there are indications that Ganymede’s\r\ncrust may not have been as rigid as Callisto’s). Going further, he added\r\nthat Callisto and Mercury, the least dense and the most dense,\r\nrespectively, of the terrestrial-style planets, although totally\r\ndifferent in composition and density, seem to have similar surfaces and\r\nsimilar histories. What would have happened to Mercury if it had been\r\nmade of ice, water, and rock as Callisto is? Would it have evolved as\r\nCallisto did?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: One of the most spectacular of the Voyager 2 images\r\n    was obtained from inside the shadow of Jupiter. Looking back toward\r\n    the planet and the rings with its wide-angle camera, the spacecraft\r\n    took these photos on July 10 from a distance of 1.5 million\r\n    kilometers. The ribbon-like nature of the rings is clearly shown.\r\n    The planet is outlined by sunlight scattered from a haze layer high\r\n    in the atmosphere.

The surface consists\r\nprimarily of uniformly bright terrain crossed by linear markings and\r\nvery low ridges.\r\n\r\nThere are four basic terrain types on Ganymede, including younger,\r\nsmooth terrain and a rugged impact basin first observed by Voyager 2.\r\n\r\nCallisto’s entire surface is densely cratered and is likely to be\r\nseveral billion years old.\r\n\r\nEquatorial surface temperatures on the Galilean satellites range from 80\r\nK (night) to 155 K (the subsolar point on Callisto).\r\n\r\n                             Magnetosphere\r\n\r\nThe outer region of the magnetosphere contains a hot plasma consisting\r\nprimarily of hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur ions.\r\n\r\nThe hot plasma generally flows in the corotation direction out to the\r\nboundary of the magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nBeyond about 160 R_J, the hot plasma streams nearly antisunward.\r\n\r\nOutbound the spacecraft experienced multiple magnetopause crossings\r\nbetween 204 R_J and 215 R_J.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of oxygen and sulfur relative to helium at high energy\r\nincreases with decreasing distance from Jupiter.\r\n\r\nMeasurements of high energy oxygen suggest that these nuclei are\r\ndiffusing inward toward Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe ultraviolet emission from the Io plasma torus was twice as bright as\r\nfour months earlier and the temperature had decreased by 30 percent to\r\n60 000 K.\r\n\r\nThe low-frequency (kilometric) radio emissions from Jupiter have a\r\nstrong latitude dependence and often contain narrowband emissions that\r\ndrift to lower or higher frequencies with time.\r\n\r\nA complex magnetospheric interaction with Ganymede was observed in the\r\nmagnetic field, plasma, and energetic particles up to about 200 000\r\nkilometers from the satellite.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3]Adapted from a summary prepared by E.

[P-22172]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            A New Satellite\r\n\r\nOne of the most fascinating discoveries of Voyager 2 was not recognized\r\nat first. Graduate student David Jewitt of the California Institute of\r\nTechnology, working with Imaging Team member Ed Danielson, began a\r\ndetailed analysis of all the ring photos in late summer. In early\r\nOctober he determined that a short streak on a photo taken July 8,\r\npreviously presumed to be an image of a star trailed by the time\r\nexposure, did not correspond to any known star position. Perhaps this\r\nwas a new satellite! Additional sleuthing turned up a second image of\r\nthe same part of the ring that also showed the anomalous object,\r\ntogether with trails due to known stars. The differing angles and\r\nlengths of the trails of the object and the stars confirmed that this\r\nwas indeed a 14th satellite of Jupiter. Following the guidelines of the\r\nInternational Astronomical Union, it was designated 1979J1, pending\r\nlater assignment of a mythological name. The proposed name is Adrastea,\r\na nymph who nursed the infant Zeus in Greek legend.\r\n\r\nThe newly discovered satellite orbits Jupiter at a distance of 58 000\r\nkilometers above the equatorial cloud tops, placing it just at the outer\r\nedge of the ring and much closer to the planet than is Amalthea,\r\npreviously thought to be the innermost satellite. It travels at 30\r\nkilometers per second (nearly 70 000 miles per hour), circling Jupiter\r\nin just seven hours and eight minutes. From its brightness, scientists\r\nguessed that it might be 30-40 kilometers in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of Adrastea to the ring suggests a relationship between\r\nthe two. When the discovery was announced to the press in mid-October,\r\nit was speculated that the ring material might originate on the\r\nsatellite, perhaps eroded away by the energetic charged particles in the\r\ninner Jovian magnetosphere. Once again, Voyager had added to our\r\nperspective on planetary processes, suggesting that undiscovered but\r\nsimilar small satellites might also be associated with the rings of\r\nSaturn and Uranus.\r\n\r\nVoyager 2 had certainly added a few years’ of data of its own to Voyager\r\n1’s “ten years’ worth of data.” It had given a different view of the\r\nJovian system, helping to solve some of the mystery surrounding Jupiter\r\nand its satellites, and creating new mysteries. As Voyager 2 sped out\r\naway from Jupiter, riding along the giant planet’s huge magnetotail,\r\nattention turned to Saturn: What would Pioneer 11, the Pathfinder,\r\ndiscover in September 1979? What would the Voyagers learn in November\r\n1980 and August 1981? Would all go well? Would Voyager 2 fly on to\r\nUranus?\r\n\r\nThere was also a yearning to examine more closely, with the Galileo\r\nProject, what had been unknown for so long, yet had become so familiar\r\nin only a few months’ time—the little dark, red “potato” Amalthea, the\r\nvolcano-covered world Io, the mysterious “cracked billiard ball” Europa,\r\ncratered and groovy Ganymede, ancient Callisto, and the king of the\r\nplanets itself, a colorful, banded world of stable climate and\r\never-changing weather patterns.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A fifteenth satellite of Jupiter was discovered in\r\n    the spring of 1980 by Steven Synnott of JPL. It was first seen on\r\n    this Voyager 1 image taken March 5, 1979, in which the\r\n    75-kilometer-diameter satellite shows as a dark oval against the\r\n    planet.

The giant revealed by Voyager is a gas planet of great\r\ncomplexity; its atmosphere is in constant motion, driven by heat\r\nescaping from a glowing interior as well as by sunlight absorbed from\r\nabove. Energetic atomic particles stream around it, caught in a magnetic\r\nfield that reaches out nearly 10 million kilometers into the surrounding\r\nspace, embracing the seven inner satellites. From its deep interior\r\nthrough its seething clouds out to its pulsating magnetosphere, Jupiter\r\nis a place where forces of incredible energy contend.\r\n\r\nAt its birth, Jupiter shone like a star. The energy released by\r\ninfalling material from the solar nebula heated its interior, and the\r\nlarger it grew the hotter it became. Theorists calculate that when the\r\nnebular material was finally exhausted, Jupiter had a diameter more than\r\nten times its present one, a central temperature of about 50 000 K, and\r\na luminosity about one percent as great as that of the Sun today.\r\n\r\nAt this early stage, Jupiter rivaled the Sun. Had it been perhaps 70\r\ntimes more massive than it was, it would have continued to contract and\r\nincrease in temperature, until self-sustaining nuclear reactions could\r\nignite in its interior. If this had happened, the Sun would have been a\r\ndouble star, and the Earth and the other planets might not have formed.\r\nHowever, Jupiter did not make it as a star; after a brief flash of\r\nglory, it began to cool.\r\n\r\nAt first Jupiter continued to collapse. Within the first ten million\r\nyears of its life, the planet was reduced to nearly its present size,\r\nwith only a few percent additional shrinkage during the past 4.5 billion\r\nyears. The luminosity also dropped as internal heat was carried to the\r\nsurface by convection and radiated away to space. After a million years\r\nJupiter emitted only one-hundred thousandth as much radiation as the\r\nSun, and today its luminosity is only one-ten billionth of the Sun’s.\r\n\r\nJupiter’s internal energy, although small by stellar standards, has\r\nimportant effects on the planet. About 10¹⁷ watts of power, comparable\r\nto that received by Jupiter from the Sun, reach the surface from the\r\nstill-luminous interior. The central temperature is still thought to be\r\nabout 30 000 K, sufficient to maintain the interior in a molten state.\r\nScientists generally agree that Jupiter is an entirely fluid planet,\r\nwith no solid core whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 Composition and Atmospheric Structure\r\n\r\nBecause of its great mass, Jupiter has been undiscriminating in its\r\ncomposition. All gases and solids available in the early solar nebula\r\nwere attracted and held by its powerful gravity. Thus it is expected\r\nthat Jupiter has the same basic composition as the Sun, with both bodies\r\npreserving a sample of the original cosmic material from which the solar\r\nsystem formed.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Jupiter is a gas giant, composed of the same elements\r\n    as the Sun and stars—primarily hydrogen and helium. Its internal\r\n    structure is dominated by the properties of hydrogen, its most\r\n    abundant constituent and by the high temperatures in the deep\r\n    interior that remain from its luminous youth. Most of the interior\r\n    is liquid: metallic hydrogen at great depths and high pressures, and\r\n    normal hydrogen nearer the surface. In the upper few thousand\r\n    kilometers, the hydrogen is a gas. The primary known or suspected\r\n    cloud layers are, from the top down, thin hydrocarbon “smog”;\r\n    ammonia; ammonium hydrosulfide; water-ice, and liquid water.\r\n    [260-828]]\r\n\r\n  Cloud top-aerosols\r\n  Ammonia crystals\r\n  Ammonium hydrosulfide clouds\r\n  Ice crystal clouds\r\n  Water droplets\r\n  Trace compounds\r\n  Fluid molecular hydrogen\r\n  Transition Zone\r\n  Fluid metallic hydrogen\r\n  Possible core\r\n\r\nThe primary constituents of Jupiter have long been suspected to be\r\nhydrogen and helium, the two simplest and lightest atoms. However, it\r\nhas proved impossible to derive accurate measurements of the abundance\r\nof these two elements from astronomical observations. On the basis of a\r\nrather simple infrared measurement, Pioneer investigators found He/H₂ =\r\n0.14 ± 0.08. On Voyager, IRIS was able to obtain much improved infrared\r\nspectra, yielding an initial value of He/H₂ = 0.11 ± 0.3. Voyager\r\nscientists expect that further analysis will reduce the uncertainty to\r\nabout ± 0.01. The ratio of 0.11 is in excellent agreement with the solar\r\nvalue of about 0.12, supporting the idea that Jupiter and the Sun have\r\nsimilar elemental compositions.\r\n\r\nAstronomers have known for a long time that, in addition to hydrogen and\r\nhelium, the compounds methane (CH₄) and ammonia (NH₃) are present in the\r\nvisible atmosphere of Jupiter. In the 1970s, additional spectra in the\r\ninfrared resulted in the discovery of water (H₂O), ethane (C₂H₆),\r\ngermane (GeH₄), acetylene (C₂H₂), phosphine (PH₃), carbon monoxide (CO),\r\nhydrogen cyanide (HCN), and carbon dioxide (CO₂). All these are trace\r\nconstituents, with two of them, ethane and acetylene, apparently formed\r\nat high altitudes by the action of sunlight on methane.\r\n\r\nA total of approximately 100 000 infrared spectra, many of small regions\r\non the disk, were obtained by IRIS. These spectra generally show\r\nhydrogen, helium, methane, ammonia, phosphine, ethane, and acetylene. In\r\naddition, excellent spectra were obtained in “hot spots,” regions in\r\nwhich breaks in the upper clouds permit radiation from deeper layers to\r\nescape. (The hot spots generally correspond to dark brown regions on\r\nphotographs of the planet.) IRIS measured temperatures in the hot spots\r\nup to -13° C but no higher; apparently this temperature corresponds to\r\nthe top of a deeper cloud deck. Spectral features indicative of the\r\npresence of water vapor and germane were clearly seen in the hot spots.\r\n\r\nFurther analysis of the IRIS spectra will be required to derive the\r\nabundances of the gases detected. However, even the preliminary data\r\nshowed how variable Jupiter can be, especially in its upper atmosphere.\r\nThe two hydrocarbons, ethane and acetylene, vary in relative abundance\r\nwith latitude; there is less acetylene near the poles. In addition to\r\nthis planetwide trend, smaller variations were seen from place to place\r\nand between the observations in March and July. All the variations will\r\neventually provide information on the processes of formation,\r\ntransportation, and destruction of hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere.\r\n\r\n     ELEMENTS DETECTED IN THE JOVIAN MAGNETOSPHERE\r\n      Element       Atomic          Instruments\r\n                    Number\r\n\r\n  Hydrogen (H)            1  UVS, Plasma, LECP, CRS\r\n  Helium (He)             2  Plasma, LECP\r\n  Carbon (C)              6  LECP\r\n  Nitrogen (N)            7  CRS\r\n  Oxygen (O)              8  UVS, Plasma, LECP, CRS\r\n  Neon (Ne)              10  CRS\r\n  Sodium (Na)            11  LECP, CRS\r\n  Magnesium (Mg)         12  CRS\r\n  Silicon (Si)           14  CRS\r\n  Sulfur (S)             16  UVS, Plasma, LECP, CRS\r\n  Iron (Fe)              26  CRS\r\n\r\nVoyager did not make any direct measurements of the chemical composition\r\nof the clouds, but theorists generally agree that the uppermost clouds\r\nare ammonia cirrus, and that layers of ammonium hydrosulfide (NH₄SH) and\r\nwater exist at deeper levels. All these clouds are formed in the\r\ntroposphere, the layer of the atmosphere in which convection takes\r\nplace. The top of the ammonia cloud deck is thought to have a pressure\r\nof about 1 atmosphere and a temperature of about -113° C.\r\n\r\nAmmonia cirrus is white, yet Jupiter’s clouds display a spectacular\r\nrange of colors. Voyager did not determine the nature of the coloring\r\nagents; they may be minor constituents—trace impurities in a sea of\r\nwhite clouds. Perhaps organic polymers, formed from atmospheric\r\nchemicals such as methane and ammonia that have reacted with lightning,\r\nare responsible for the oranges and yellows. The color of the Red Spot\r\ncould be caused by red phosphorus (P₄). According to this theory,\r\nphosphine (PH₃) from deep in Jupiter’s atmosphere is brought to high\r\naltitudes by the upwelling of the Great Red Spot. Ultraviolet light,\r\npenetrating the upper reaches of the Red Spot, splits the phosphine\r\nmolecules, and, through a series of chemical reactions, converts the\r\nphosphine into pure phosphorus. However, this theory fails to explain\r\nthe existence of the smaller red spots on Jupiter; these spots are not\r\nat such high altitudes as the Great Red Spot (which is the highest and\r\ncoldest of Jupiter’s visible clouds), so it is unlikely that ultraviolet\r\nlight could react with any phosphine in these areas to produce red\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Although the Voyager spacecraft never flew over the\r\n    poles of Jupiter, it is possible to reconstruct from several images\r\n    the View that would be seen from directly above or below the planet.\r\n    Note the absence of a strong banded structure near both poles. The\r\n    regular spacing of cloud features is obvious. In the Southern\r\n    hemisphere, the three white ovals are 90 degrees apart in longitude,\r\n    but a fourth oval at the other quadrant is missing. The irregular\r\n    black areas at each pole are places for which no Voyager data exist.\r\n    The resolution of the original pictures from which these polar\r\n    projections were made was about 600 kilometers.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: North pole.

Sulfur forms polymers (S₃, S₄, S₅, S₈,) that\r\nare yellow, red, and brown, but no sulfur in any form has been detected\r\non Jupiter. “We never promised you we were going to identify the colors\r\non Jupiter with this mission,” one of the atmospheric scientists\r\nremarked, “but we will have a probe that is going into the atmosphere in\r\nthe mid-1980s—Galileo.” Perhaps the mystery of the Jovian clouds will\r\nhave to wait till then.\r\n\r\nTemperature maps of Jupiter were obtained by IRIS in radiation arising\r\nat different levels above the clouds. Maps show temperatures at\r\npressures of 0.8 atmosphere near the clouds, and 0.2 atmosphere near the\r\ntop of the troposphere. In addition to the low temperatures over the\r\nbright zones and the higher temperatures over dark belts, there is a\r\ngreat deal of smaller scale structure. It is interesting that a cold\r\narea corresponding to the Great Red Spot is clearly visible even near\r\nthe top of the troposphere, indicating that this feature disturbs the\r\natmosphere to very high altitudes.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the atmosphere of Jupiter above the troposphere was\r\ninvestigated through the radio occultation experiment as well as by\r\nIRIS. The level in which the minimum temperature of about -173° C occurs\r\nhas a pressure of 0.1 atmosphere. Above this point lies the\r\nstratosphere, in which temperatures increase with altitude as a result\r\nof sunlight absorbed by the gas or by aerosol particles resembling smog.\r\nAt 70 kilometers above the ammonia clouds, the temperature is about\r\n-113° C. Above this level, the temperature stays approximately constant,\r\nalthough at extreme altitudes the temperature again rises in the\r\nionosphere.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: If one could “unwrap” Jupiter like a map, views such\r\n    as these would be obtained. The comparison between the pictures\r\n    shows the relative motions of features in Jupiter’s atmosphere. It\r\n    can be seen, for example, that the Great Red Spot moved westward and\r\n    the white ovals eastward during the time between the acquisition of\r\n    these pictures. Regular plume patterns are equidistant around the\r\n    northern edge of the equator, while a train of small spots moved\r\n    eastward at approximately latitude 80° S. In addition to these\r\n    relative motions, significant changes are evident in the\r\n    recirculating flow east of the Great Red Spot, in the disturbed\r\n    region west of the Great Red Spot, and as seen in the brightening of\r\n    material spreading into the equatorial region from the more\r\n    southerly latitudes. [P-21771C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The planet as it appeared about March 1.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: As it was in early July.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Weather on Jupiter\r\n\r\nThe Voyager pictures reveal a planet of complex atmospheric motions.\r\nSpots chase after each other, meet, whirl around, mingle, and then split\r\nup again; filamentary structures curl into spirals that open outward;\r\nfeathery cloud systems reach out toward neighboring regions; cumulus\r\nclouds that look like ostrich plumes may brighten suddenly as they float\r\ntoward the east; spots stream around the Red Spot or get caught up in\r\nits vortical motion—all in an incredible interplay of color, texture,\r\nand eastward and westward flows. Such changes can be noticed in the\r\nspace of only a few Jovian days.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Differing characteristics of Jupiter’s meteorology\r\n    are apparent in high-resolution images, such as this one taken by\r\n    Voyager 1 on March 2 at a range of 4 million kilometers. The\r\n    well-defined pale orange line running from southwest to northeast\r\n    (north is at the top) marks the high-speed north temperate current\r\n    with wind speeds of about 120 meters per second. Toward the top of\r\n    the picture, a weaker jet of approximately 30 meters per second is\r\n    characterized by wave patterns and cloud features which have been\r\n    observed to rotate in a clockwise manner at these latitudes of about\r\n    35°N. These clouds have been observed to have lifetimes of one to\r\n    two years. [P-21193C]]\r\n\r\nOn a broader time scale, greater changes on the face of Jupiter can be\r\nseen. Features drift around the planet; even the large white ovals and\r\nthe Great Red Spot slide along in their respective latitudes. Belts or\r\nzones intrude upon each other, resulting in one of the banded structures\r\nsplitting up or seeming to squeeze together and eventually disappear.\r\nSmall structures form, then die. The largest spots may slowly shrink in\r\nsize, and the Red Spot itself changes its size and color.\r\n\r\nThe Jupiter of Pioneers 10 and 11 was quite unlike the planet seen by\r\nVoyager 1. At the time of the Pioneer exploration, the Great Red Spot,\r\nembedded in a huge white zone, was more uniformly colored, and pale\r\nbrown bands circled the northern hemisphere. In the intervening years,\r\nthe south temperate latitudes have changed completely, developing the\r\ncomplex turbulent clouds seen around the Red Spot by Voyager 1. Yet,\r\neven between the two Voyagers, Jupiter appeared to be undergoing a\r\ndynamic “facelift.” At a quick glance, Voyager 2 photographs showed the\r\nvisage that had been familiar since early in 1979, but a closer look\r\nshowed that it is not quite the same. The white band below the Great Red\r\nSpot, fairly broad during the first flyby, had become a thin white\r\nribbon where it rims the southern edge of the Spot. The turbulence to\r\nthe west of the Red Spot had stretched out and become “blander” than it\r\nwas before. Small rotating clouds seemed to be forming out of the waves\r\nin this region. The cloud structure that had been east of the Red Spot\r\nduring the Voyager 1 flyby spread out, covering the northern boundary\r\nand preventing small clouds from circling the huge red oval. The Red\r\nSpot itself also changed. Its northern boundary seemed—at least\r\nvisually—to be more set off from the clouds that surround it, and the\r\nfeature appeared to be more uniform in color, perhaps reverting back to\r\nthe personality it had in Pioneer days.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Jupiter’s cloud patterns changed significantly in the\r\n    few months between the two Voyager flybys. Most of the changes are\r\n    the result of differential rotation, in which the prevailing winds\r\n    at different latitudes shift long-lived features with respect to\r\n    those north or south. Thus, for example, the three large white ovals\r\n    shifted nearly 90 degrees in longitude, relative to the Great Red\r\n    Spot, between March and July. [P-21599]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Cloud patterns from Voyager 2.]\r\n\r\nThe most obvious features in the atmosphere of Jupiter, after the banded\r\nbelts and zones, are the Great Red Spot and the three white ovals. These\r\nhave often been described as “storms” in Jupiter’s atmosphere. The ovals\r\nare about the size of the Moon, and the Red Spot is larger than the\r\nEarth. Voyager has revealed that in many respects the white ovals, which\r\nformed in 1939, resemble their ancient red relative. All four spots are\r\nsouthern hemispheric anticyclonic features that exhibit counterclockwise\r\nmotion; hence they are meteorologically similar. Other smaller bright\r\nelliptical and circular spots also exhibit anticyclonic motion, rotating\r\nclockwise in the northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere. In general, these features are circled by\r\nfilamentary rings that are darker than the spots they surround. Hints of\r\ninterior spiral structure can be seen in some of these spots. All the\r\nelliptical features in the southern hemisphere lie to the south of the\r\nstrong westward-blowing jet streams. The spots tend to become rounder\r\nthe closer they are to the poles.\r\n\r\nAlong the northern edge of the equator are a number of cloud plumes,\r\nwhich appear to be regularly spaced all around the planet. Some of the\r\nplumes have been observed to brighten rapidly, which may be an\r\nindication of convective activity; indeed, some of the plume structures\r\nseem to resemble the convective storms that form in the Earth’s tropics.\r\nThe plumes travel eastward at speeds ranging from about 100 to 150\r\nmeters per second, but they do not move as a unit.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Great Red Spot of Jupiter is a magnificent sight,\r\n    whether viewed in normal or exaggerated color. These pictures were\r\n    taken by Voyager 1 at a range of about 1 million kilometers; the\r\n    area shown is about 25 000 kilometers, with features visible on the\r\n    originals that are as small as 30 kilometers across. The Red Spot is\r\n    partly obscured on the north by a thin layer of overlying ammonia\r\n    cirrus cloud. South of the Red Spot is one of the three white ovals,\r\n    which are also anticyclonic vortices in the atmosphere.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: This frame is in natural color. [P-21430C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The red and blue have been greatly exaggerated in\r\n    this frame to bring out fine detail in the cloud structure.\r\n    [P-21431C]]\r\n\r\nThe most visible cloud interactions take place in the region of the\r\nGreat Red Spot. Material within the Red Spot rotates about once every\r\nsix days. Infrared measurements show that the Red Spot is a region of\r\natmospheric upwelling, which extends to very high altitudes; however,\r\nthe divergent flow suggested by this upwelling seems to be very\r\nsmall—one bright feature was observed to circle the Red Spot for sixty\r\ndays without appreciably changing its distance from the spot’s center.\r\nDuring the Voyager 1 flyby, spots were seen to move toward the Red Spot\r\nfrom the east, flow along its northern border, then either flow on to\r\nthe west past the Red Spot or into the outer regions of its vortex. A\r\nspot caught on the outer edge of the Red Spot flow might break in two as\r\nit reached the eastern edge of the spot, with one piece remaining in the\r\nvortex and the other moving off to the east. Alternatively, a spot\r\nfloating toward the Red Spot from the east might be pushed northward to\r\njoin the eastward current flowing north of the giant red oval.\r\n\r\nBy the time of the second Voyager encounter, a ribbon of white clouds\r\ncurled around the northern border of the Red Spot, blocking the motion\r\nof small spots that might otherwise have been caught up in the vortex.\r\nSpots approaching the Red Spot from the east just turned around and\r\nheaded back in the direction from which they had come.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager 2 captured the Red Spot region four months\r\n    after Voyager 1, when some changes had taken place in the cloud\r\n    circulation pattern around it. This is a mosaic of Voyager 2 frames,\r\n    taken on July 6. The white oval to the south is not the same one\r\n    that was present in a similar location during the Voyager 1 flyby,\r\n    because of differential rotation at the two latitudes. [260-606]]\r\n\r\nIn the northern hemisphere, small brown anticyclonic features speed\r\naround the planet, often colliding with one another. On collision, the\r\nspots may combine and roll around together for a while. Ultimately, part\r\nof the mass of the combined spots is ejected as a streamer, and the\r\nremaining material continues on its eastward path.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Order out of Chaos\r\n\r\nDespite all the turbulence in Jupiter’s atmosphere—this ever-changing\r\nchaotic mixture of cyclonic and anticyclonic flows, of ovals and\r\nfilaments, of reds, browns, and whites—a pattern may be emerging: There\r\nis an underlying order to the seemingly random mixing of patterns we see\r\nin the Jovian atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFirst, the changing weather patterns are in some sense cyclic. The fact\r\nthat Jupiter may be reverting to the appearance it presented at the time\r\nof Pioneers 10 and 11 is not surprising. From Earth-based studies,\r\nastronomers have found that the face of Jupiter often goes through a\r\nmajor change every few years. The transition is very rapid, but the\r\nplanet maintains its new “look” for some time—until the next major\r\ntransition. At the time of the Pioneer flybys, “The Red Spot was\r\nprominent, but it was surrounded by intense cloud. There was no visible\r\nstructure at all in the south tropical zone—it was totally bland. You\r\ncouldn’t see the turbulent area to the west,” explained Garry Hunt.\r\n“And, I believe that the buildup of cloud that we’re seeing to the east\r\nof the Red Spot is the beginning of the transition that will produce the\r\nPioneer look.”\r\n\r\nThere is even more order underlying Jupiter’s changing atmosphere. This\r\norder is revealed in part in the alternating belts and zones. It is\r\nbelieved that the cloud-covered zones are regions of rising air, and the\r\nbelts are regions of descending air. The internal energy of Jupiter\r\nprovides the power to maintain this pattern of slow vertical\r\ncirculation. In addition, there are horizontal or zonal flows that are\r\nmuch more regular than the changing cloud patterns.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The three large white ovals are the longest-lived\r\n    features in Jupiter’s atmosphere, after the Great Red Spot. Like the\r\n    Red Spot, they are anticyclonic, or high-pressure, regions. During\r\n    Voyager 2 encounter, one of the ovals was just south of the Red\r\n    Spot. This picture shows the other two ovals as they looked in early\r\n    July. The clouds show very similar internal structures. To the east\r\n    of each of them, recirculating currents are clearly seen.\r\n    [P-21754C]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: In this frame, a similar structure is seen to the\r\n    west of the cloud.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A sequence of pictures of Jupiter, taken once per\r\n    rotation (about ten hours), can be used to construct a time-lapse\r\n    movie of the circulation of the Jovian atmosphere. These frames are\r\n    from the Voyager 1 “Blue Movie” of the Great Red Spot region. Every\r\n    odd Jovian rotation is shown, so the 24 frames correspond to 48\r\n    Jupiter days, or about 20 Earth days. White spots can be seen\r\n    entering the Red Spot from the upper right and being carried around\r\n    by its six-day rotation until they are ejected toward the lower\r\n    right. Above the Red Spot, the flow is toward the right; below it,\r\n    toward the left. The rotation of the Spot is counterclockwise, or\r\n    anticyclonic. [260-449]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: At different latitudes, the strong prevailing zonal\r\n    winds produce different apparent rotation rates. Plotted here are\r\n    the horizontal velocities measured from a pair of Voyager images\r\n    taken one rotation (about ten hours) apart. Also shown for\r\n    comparison are older ground-based measurements obtained from careful\r\n    timings of the apparent rotation rate at different latitudes. The\r\n    excellent agreement of the two plots indicates the stability of the\r\n    zonal winds. Also, the wind pattern shows much greater symmetry\r\n    between northern and southern hemispheres than do the more\r\n    superficial cloud patterns.]\r\n\r\n“At first, Voyager seemed to do nothing but emphasize the chaos, not the\r\norder in Jupiter’s atmosphere,” Andy Ingersoll stated. “There are\r\nturbulent regions in which individual little spots seem to change every\r\nJovian rotation. And the whole texture in certain turbulent regions is\r\nunrecognizable in one earth day.” With the Voyager spacecraft, more\r\ndetail could be seen than ever before; in addition, changes could be\r\nobserved on a small timescale, as they happened. “It became much more of\r\na mystery how large-scale order could exist in the face of all this\r\nsmall-scale chaos. But I think we are beginning to see the order\r\nunderneath. What we are looking at when we observe Jupiter are minute\r\ncloud particles representing only a small fraction of the mass of the\r\natmosphere.” The large-scale order the scientists had found was a\r\nregular alternation of eastward and westward jets. “If we take all the\r\nmeasurements from Earth-based observations over the last 75 years, we\r\nfind that every current that has ever been seen from the Earth over 75\r\nyears is visible in one ten-hour rotation. They’re all there—they were\r\njust invisible.” The ever-changing appearance was dancing above a\r\nregular, almost stationary pattern of alternating flows, which may come\r\nfrom deep within Jupiter’s atmosphere. Why this alternating pattern\r\npersists remains a mystery. Even if the underlying pattern can be\r\nthought of as a sort of Jovian climate, it still does not explain the\r\nmechanics of “the minor sideshow”—the changing weather patterns.\r\nAnalysis of the Voyager pictures is sure to keep planetary\r\nmeteorologists busy for many years to come.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        Lights in the Night Sky\r\n\r\nToward the end of the first encounter period, Voyager 1 flew behind\r\nJupiter, and the spacecraft’s wide-angle camera scanned the northern\r\nhemisphere on the nightside of the planet, searching for aurorae and\r\nlightning bolts. The most impressive darkside feature found was a\r\ntremendous aurora in the north polar region. But this was not the first\r\ntime Jovian aurorae had been detected. Very-high-energy auroral\r\nemissions resulting from ultraviolet glows of atomic and molecular\r\nhydrogen had been detected prior to encounter on the bright side of\r\nJupiter by the ultraviolet spectrometer. The ultraviolet observations\r\nindicate that atmospheric temperatures in the auroral regions are at\r\nleast 1000 K. In both the visible and the ultraviolet spectra, the\r\naurorae are confined to the polar regions and result from charged\r\nmagnetospheric particles striking the upper atmosphere. The ultraviolet\r\naurorae are created when high-energy particles from the Io plasma torus\r\nspiral in toward Jupiter on magnetic field lines.\r\n\r\nSeveral meteor trails were also evident in the darkside pictures of\r\nJupiter’s atmosphere. Traveling at roughly 60 kilometers per second as\r\nthey entered, these fireballs brightened quickly and seemed to survive\r\nfor about 1000 kilometers before they died.\r\n\r\nClusters of lightning bolts—indicative of electrical storms—were also\r\ndiscovered on Jupiter’s nightside. This particular phenomenon does not\r\nseem to depend on latitude. The Voyager 1 photograph that captured the\r\nhuge Jovian aurora also caught the electrical discharges of 19\r\nsuperbolts of lightning, and Voyager 2 photographs located eight\r\nadditional flashes. Radio emission (whistlers) from lightning discharges\r\nwere also detected by the Voyager radio astronomy receivers and the\r\nplasma wave instrument.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The night side of Jupiter is not dull. A large aurora\r\n    (northern light) arcs across the northern horizon, while farther\r\n    south about twenty large bolts of lightning illuminate electrical\r\n    storms in the clouds. Similar pictures also revealed fireballs, or\r\n    large meteors, burning up in the atmosphere of Jupiter.\r\n    [P-21283B/W]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Magnetic Field\r\n\r\nDeep in the interior of Jupiter, the pressures are so great that\r\nhydrogen becomes an electrical conductor, like a metal. Currents driven\r\nby the rapid rotation of the planet are thought to flow in this metallic\r\ncore. The result is a magnetic field that penetrates the space around\r\nJupiter.\r\n\r\nDirect measurements of the Jovian magnetic field were first made by the\r\nPioneers, and Voyager results generally confirm the initial findings.\r\nThe strength of the Jovian field is about 4000 times greater than that\r\nof the Earth. The dipolar axis is not at the center of Jupiter, but\r\noffset by about 10 000 kilometers and tipped by 11 degrees from the axis\r\nof rotation. Each time the planet spins, the field wobbles up and down,\r\ncarrying with it the trapped plasma of the radiation belts. The Voyager\r\nparticles and fields instruments concentrated not on the planetary\r\nmagnetic field but on the processes taking place in the magnetosphere.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A probe of the Jovian atmosphere is obtained each\r\n    time a spacecraft passes behind the planet as seen from the Earth.\r\n    Passage through the ionosphere and atmosphere alters the phase of\r\n    the radio telemetry signal, and subsequent computer analysis allows\r\n    members of the Radio Science Team to reconstruct the profile of the\r\n    atmosphere. Shown here is the atmospheric temperature as a function\r\n    of pressure as derived from the Voyager 1 X-band occultation data,\r\n    corresponding to a point at latitude 12°S, longitude 63°. The two\r\n    curves represent extreme interpretations of the same data; the best\r\n    fit lies somewhere between. Accuracy is high at greater depths but\r\n    poor at levels above a pressure of about 0.03 bar. Clearly shown is\r\n    the temperature minimum near 0.1 bar and the steady increase of\r\n    temperature with depth as the radio beam probed toward the cloud\r\n    level near 1.0 bar.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: At a wavelength near 5 micrometers, the primary gases\r\n    in the atmosphere of Jupiter are particularly transparent, and the\r\n    infrared radiation from the planet comes from relatively great\r\n    depths. At these depths, it is possible to see evidence of gases\r\n    such as water vapor that condense at higher altitudes where the\r\n    temperatures are lower. This IRIS spectrum in the 5-micrometer\r\n    spectral region shows features identified with water (H₂O), germane\r\n    (GeH₄), and deuterated methane (CH₃D), as well as the more easily\r\n    detected ammonia (NH₃).]\r\n\r\n  Wavelength (µm)\r\n    H₂O\r\n    CH₃D\r\n    GeH₄\r\n    NH₃\r\n    Voyager 1\r\n    Voyager 2\r\n  Wave number (cm⁻¹)\r\n  Voyager 1 brightness temperature (K)\r\n  Voyager 2 brightness temperature (K)\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The structure of the Jovian atmosphere can be derived\r\n    from infrared spectra as well as from the radio occultation data.\r\n    This profile of temperature as a function of pressure covers the\r\n    same range of altitudes as does the preceding figure and is in good\r\n    agreement.

Surprisingly, the cool region\r\n    associated with the Great Red Spot (latitude 23°S) is more apparent\r\n    at high altitude.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The observed temperature at a depth near the cloud\r\n    tops (0.8 bar).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The observed temperature at an altitude about 30\r\n    kilometers higher (0.15 bar).]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           The Magnetosphere\r\n\r\nGiant Jupiter has an enormous realm—from the size of its satellite\r\nsystem to its tremendous aurorae and superbolts of lightning, to the\r\nhuge planet-sized cloud features that surround its atmosphere. The most\r\ngargantuan Jovian feature is its magnetosphere, which envelopes the\r\nsatellites and constantly changes in size, pumping in and out at the\r\nwhim of the solar wind. The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft provided four\r\ncuts through this dynamic region, showing that its borders in the upwind\r\nsolar direction lie between 50 R_J and 100 R_J from Jupiter. Downwind,\r\naway from the Sun, the magnetosphere extends much farther; some\r\nscientists postulate that a magnetotail may reach as far as the orbit of\r\nSaturn.\r\n\r\nCharged particles in the magnetosphere are subject to powerful forces.\r\nTightly embedded in Jupiter, the magnetic field spins with a ten-hour\r\nperiod as the planet rotates. The particles are caught in the spinning\r\nfield and accelerated to high speeds. The result is a co-rotating plasma\r\nin the magnetic equator of Jupiter, extending outward to at least 20\r\nR_J. Beyond this distance, the flow breaks up and the magnetosphere is\r\nmore unstable. Within the co-rotation region, the spinning plasma sets\r\nup a powerful electric current girdling the planet.\r\n\r\nCharged particles can be accelerated in the magnetosphere to high\r\nenergies, corresponding to speeds tens of thousands of kilometers per\r\nsecond. Some of these particle streams escape from the inner parts of\r\nthe magnetosphere and can penetrate the magnetopause and be ejected from\r\nthe Jovian system. On Voyager 1, the low energy charged particle\r\ninstrument began detecting these streams of “hot” plasma on 22 January,\r\nwhen Voyager 1 was still 600 R_J (almost 50 million kilometers) from the\r\nplanet. Voyager 2 first detected Jovian particles at an even greater\r\ndistance, 800 R_J. Hydrogen and helium ions (protons and alpha\r\nparticles) dominate the magnetosphere at great distances from Jupiter,\r\nbut increasing amounts of sulfur and oxygen appeared as the spacecraft\r\ncrossed the magnetopause. The heavier ions presumably originate from Io.\r\n\r\nIn the inner magnetosphere, the Galilean satellites have a powerful\r\ninfluence on the populations of fast-moving particles. During the\r\nVoyager 1 encounter, the primary effect was observed at Io, where the\r\nsatellite apparently sweeps up energetic electrons. In the million-volt\r\nenergy range, these particles are depleted near Io, with peaks observed\r\nboth inside and outside the satellite’s orbit. Voyager 2 passed close to\r\nGanymede, and here also major effects were seen, with the satellite\r\napparently absorbing electrons. In the wake created by the motion of the\r\nco-rotating plasma past Ganymede, the particle populations showed large\r\nand complex variations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The magnetosphere of Jupiter can be “seen” from Earth\r\n    by its emissions at radio wavelengths. The recent development of\r\n    imaging radio telescopes in Great Britain, The Netherlands, and the\r\n    United States allows frequent mapping of the large-scale features of\r\n    the innermost magnetosphere, inside the orbit of Io. These six\r\n    images showing one rotation of Jupiter were obtained near the time\r\n    of the Voyager 1 flyby by Imke de Pater at the Westerbork Radio\r\n    Observatory near Leiden. The brightest emission is shown by dark red\r\n    or black. The size of the planet is indicated by a dotted white\r\n    circle. The tilt of the magnetosphere relative to the rotation axis\r\n    of the planet can be seen by the wobble of the magnetosphere as\r\n    Jupiter rotates.]\r\n\r\nJust inside the Jovian magnetosphere is the “hot spot” of the solar\r\nsystem: a 300-400 million degree plasma detected by Voyager 1 while it\r\nwas still about 5 million kilometers from Jupiter. T. P. Armstrong\r\ncommented, “Even the interior of the Sun is estimated to be less than 20\r\nmillion degrees.” S. M. Krimigis added that the temperature of this\r\nplasma is “the highest yet measured anywhere in the solar system.”\r\nFortunately for Voyager, this region of incredibly hot plasma is also\r\none of the solar system’s best vacuums. The spacecraft was in little\r\ndanger because the bow shock protects this region from the solar wind,\r\nand most of the particles in Jupiter’s magnetosphere are held in much\r\ncloser to the planet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Each Voyager passed through the boundaries of the\r\n    magnetosphere—the bow shock (BS) and the magnetopause (MP)—on both\r\n    the inbound and the outbound legs of its passage through the Jovian\r\n    system. In this diagram, the heavy solid line represents the\r\n    spacecraft trajectory, as seen looking down from the north. Also\r\n    shown are the positions of the bow shock in March and of the\r\n    magnetosphere in both March and July.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Several regions of plasma (charged particles) make up\r\n    the Jovian magnetosphere. These sketches, based on Voyager data,\r\n    show the magnetosphere as viewed from above (a) and as seen from the\r\n    Jovian equatorial plane (b). Most of the plasma co-rotates with the\r\n    planet and is confined near the magnetic equator, where it forms a\r\n    broad plasma sheet about 100 R_J across.]\r\n\r\nThe very hot plasma in the outer magnetosphere discovered by Voyager is\r\nthought to play an important role in establishing the size of the Jovian\r\nmagnetosphere. Although the density is low, only about one charged\r\nparticle per hundred cubic centimeters, this plasma actually carries a\r\ngreat deal of energy because of the high speed of the particles. It is\r\nthis plasma pressure, rather than the magnetic field pressure, that\r\nappears to hold off the pressure of the solar wind. However, the balance\r\nbetween hot plasma inside the magnetopause and the solar wind outside is\r\nnot very stable. The Voyager experimenters suggest that a small change\r\nin solar wind pressure can cause the boundary to become suddenly\r\nunstable. A large quantity of the hot plasma can then be lost, producing\r\nthe bursts seen at large distances and permitting a sudden collapse of\r\nthe outer magnetosphere. Continued injection of hot plasma from within\r\nwould then reinflate the magnetosphere, which would expand like a\r\nballoon until another instability developed. Processes of this sort may\r\nbe the cause of the rapidly varying magnetospheric boundaries observed\r\nby both Voyager spacecraft.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The rings of Jupiter are best seen when looking\r\n    nearly in the direction of the Sun, since the small particles that\r\n    comprise them are good forward scatterers of sunlight. This mosaic\r\n    is of Voyager 2 images (two wide angle and four narrow angle)\r\n    obtained from a perspective behind the planet and inside the shadow\r\n    of Jupiter. The spacecraft was 2 degrees below the equator of\r\n    Jupiter and 1.5 million kilometers from the rings. The shadow of the\r\n    planet can be seen to obscure the near segment of the ring near the\r\n    edge of the planet. The brightest region of the ring is about 1.8\r\n    R_J from the center of Jupiter. [260-678B]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Rings of Jupiter\r\n\r\nOne of the spectacular discoveries of Voyager was the existence of a\r\nring system of small particles circling Jupiter. Saturn and Uranus were\r\nknown to have rings, but none had been seen before at Jupiter.\r\n\r\nAs revealed by the Voyager cameras, the rings extend outward from the\r\nupper atmosphere to a distance of 53 000 kilometers above the cloud\r\ntops, 1.8 R_J from the center of the planet. The main rings, however,\r\nare much narrower, spanning from 47 000 to 53 000 kilometers above\r\nJupiter. There are two main rings, a 5000-kilometer-wide segment, and a\r\nbrighter, outer 800-kilometer segment. The thickness of the rings is\r\nunknown, except that it is certainly less than 30 kilometers, and\r\nprobably under 1 kilometer.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Structure within the ring can be seen in the best\r\n    Voyager 2 images, taken about 27 hours after closest approach to\r\n    Jupiter. This enlarged portion of a wide-angle picture taken with a\r\n    clear filter shows a bright core about 800 kilometers across with a\r\n    dimmer region a few thousand kilometers across on the inside, and a\r\n    narrow dim region on the outside. [260-674]]\r\n\r\nThe rings of Jupiter are quite tenuous, which explains why they are\r\ninvisible from Earth [although they have been detected from Earth since\r\nVoyager]. Seen face on, the brightest part of the ring blocks less than\r\none part in ten thousand of the light passing through, making it\r\nessentially transparent. In fact, the ring does not even offer much\r\nresistance to a spacecraft; Pioneer 11 traversed the ring in 1974 with\r\nno obvious ill consequences. Apparently the individual particles that\r\nmake up the ring are widely dispersed. They can be seen only when the\r\nrings are viewed nearly edge-on, or toward the Sun, where they show up\r\nwell in forward scattered light. It is this extra brilliance when\r\nbacklit that created the excellent photos taken by Voyager 2 from inside\r\nthe shadow of Jupiter.\r\n\r\nThe individual ring particles are probably dark, rocky fragments that\r\nare very small—essentially dust grains. They move around Jupiter in\r\nindividual orbits, circling the planet in 5 - 7 hours. Scientists\r\npostulate that such orbits are not stable and that the particles fall\r\nslowly in toward Jupiter. Apparently the rings are constantly renewed\r\nfrom some source, which may be the satellite Adrastea (J14), discovered\r\nby Voyager 2. There has also been speculation that Adrastea may\r\ninfluence the ring structure by sweeping particles out of the ring. At\r\npresent the rings of Jupiter remain mysterious. They are clearly very\r\ndifferent from the rings of Saturn and Uranus, and reaching an\r\nunderstanding of their origins and dynamics presents many challenges to\r\nplanetary scientists.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The four Galilean satellites of Jupiter are\r\n    planet-like worlds, revealed by Voyager to be as diverse and\r\n    fascinating as the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and\r\n    Mars. In this Voyager 1 composite, all four are shown in their\r\n    correct relative size, as they would appear from a distance of about\r\n    1 million kilometers.

Much\r\nhad been learned from telescopic studies, but not until the Voyager\r\nflights had we truly seen the Galilean satellites. The historic hours as\r\nVoyager 1 cruised past each satellite on March 5 and 6, 1979,\r\nfundamentally altered our perspective. Four new worlds were revealed, as\r\ndiverse and fascinating as the more familiar terrestrial planets.\r\nAlthough not yet household words, the names Io, Europa, Ganymede and\r\nCallisto have now been added to Mercury, Venus, Moon, and Mars in the\r\nlexicon of important “Earth-sized” bodies in the solar system.\r\n\r\nJupiter has fifteen known satellites, counting the two new satellites\r\ndiscovered by Voyager. These moons vary greatly in size, composition,\r\nand orbit. The four outermost satellites, Sinope, Pasiphae, Carme, and\r\nAnanke, circle the planet in retrograde orbits of high inclination;\r\ntheir distances from Jupiter vary between 20 and 24 million kilometers\r\n(290 R_J to 333 R_J). These small bodies, none more than 50 kilometers\r\nin diameter, require nearly two years for each orbit of Jupiter. It is\r\npossible that they are captured asteroids, but so little is known about\r\nthem that astronomers cannot tell if their surface properties resemble\r\nthose of asteroids, or if these four satellites are even similar to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe next group of Jovian satellites consists of four small\r\ndifficult-to-observe objects. These are Lysithea, Elara, Himalia, and\r\nLeda, the latter discovered by Charles Kowal of Hale Observatories in\r\n1974. They have similar orbits, varying in distance from Jupiter between\r\n11 and 12 million kilometers (about 160 R_J). Like the outer group,\r\nthese satellites have orbits of high inclination; unlike the outer\r\ngroup, they move in the proper, prograde direction around Jupiter. The\r\nlargest, Himalia (170 kilometers in diameter) and Elara (80 kilometers\r\ndiameter), are known to be very dark, rocky objects, and it seems\r\nprobable that the others are similar. It is unlikely that the census of\r\nthe outer groups of irregular satellites is complete, and new satellites\r\nless than 10 kilometers in diameter will probably be discovered.\r\n\r\nThe Jovian system is dominated, of course, by the large Galilean\r\nsatellites, which vary in size from just smaller than the Moon (Europa)\r\nto nearly as large as Mars (Ganymede). These satellites are in regular,\r\nnearly circular orbits in the same plane as the equator of Jupiter, and\r\nall four lie within the inner magnetosphere of Jupiter, where they\r\ninteract strongly with energetic charged particles and plasma. Most of\r\nthis chapter will be devoted to a discussion of these fascinating\r\nworlds.\r\n\r\nWe now know of three additional small satellites inside the orbit of Io,\r\norbiting close to Jupiter. The first, Amalthea, was discovered in 1892;\r\nit orbits Jupiter in just twelve hours at a distance of 181 000\r\nkilometers (2.55 R_J). A smaller object, Adrastea (officially 1979J1 for\r\nthe first new satellite of Jupiter discovered in 1979), is much closer,\r\nat 134 000 kilometers (1.76 R_J). As described in Chapter 7, it skirts\r\nthe outer edge of the ring, circling Jupiter in just over seven hours.\r\nThe inner satellite moves faster than Jupiter’s rotation; seen from the\r\nplanet, it would rise in the west and set in the east. Both Amalthea and\r\nAdrastea are buried deep within the inner magnetosphere where they are\r\ncontinually bombarded by energetic electrons, protons, and ions.\r\nDepletion of the Jovian radiation belt particles was observed at the\r\norbits of both satellites by Pioneer 11, which went much closer to\r\nJupiter than the Voyagers, testifying to the intensity of the\r\ninteraction between these objects and their surroundings.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Callisto was revealed by the Voyager cameras to be a\r\n    heavily cratered and hence geologically inactive world. This mosaic\r\n    of Voyager 1 images, obtained on March 6 from a distance of about\r\n    400 000 kilometers, shows surface detail as small as 10 kilometers\r\n    across. The prominent old impact feature Valhalla has a central\r\n    bright spot about 600 kilometers across, probably representing the\r\n    original impact basin. The concentric bright rings extend outward\r\n    about 1500 kilometers from the impact center.

Initially\r\ndesignated 1979J2, the unexpected new satellite orbits the planet at\r\n3.17 R_J, between Io and Amalthea. Stephen Synnott of the JPL Optical\r\nNavigation Team discovered the satellite on pictures taken during the\r\nVoyager 1 events on March 5, 1979, while searching for additional images\r\nof satellite 1979J1. It is about 75 kilometers in diameter, but nothing\r\nelse is known about its physical properties.\r\n\r\nTogether, the 15 satellites circling giant Jupiter form a mini-solar\r\nsystem. Perhaps the outer, irregular satellites were captured or\r\nresulted from the catastrophic collisions of one or more larger\r\nsatellites with passing asteroids. The inner seven satellites constitute\r\na coherent system, almost certainly formed together with Jupiter and\r\nsharing a common 4.5-billion-year history. They are fascinating as\r\nindividual worlds, and also as brothers and sisters, and the study of\r\ntheir interrelationships undoubtedly will provide insights into the\r\ngeneral problems of planetary formation and evolution.\r\n\r\n     SIZES AND DENSITIES OF THE GALILEAN SATELLITES\r\n       Name           Diameter     Density (grams per\r\n                    (kilometers)    cubic centimeter)\r\n\r\n  Io                         3640                  3.5\r\n  Europa                     3130                  3.0\r\n  Ganymede                   5270                  1.9\r\n  Callisto                   4840                  1.8\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Callisto\r\n\r\nCallisto is the least active geologically of the Galilean satellites.\r\nBasically a dead world, it bears the scars of innumerable meteoric\r\nimpacts, with virtually no sign of major internal activity. Callisto is\r\na world of craters, and to understand it we must explore the role that\r\ncratering plays in molding planetary surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe space between the planets is filled with debris, ranging from the\r\nlarger asteroids, hundreds of kilometers in size, down to microscopic\r\ngrains of dust. Inevitably, each planet collides with some of these\r\nfragments. The smaller particles do little damage; in the case of a\r\nplanet with an atmosphere, like Earth, they burn up as meteors before\r\nreaching the surface, whereas on an airless planet, they erode the\r\nsurface by sandblasting the exposed rock. The larger impacts are another\r\nmatter, and the craters they produce can be the dominant features on the\r\nsurface of a planet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyagers 1 and 2 photographed most of the surface of\r\n    Callisto at resolutions of a few kilometers or better. Shown here is\r\n    a preliminary shaded relief map. Additional measurements will\r\n    improve the accuracy of the coordinate system. [260-672]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Callisto is a world of craters, as is well shown in\r\n    this Voyager 2 photomosaic taken from a distance of 400 000\r\n    kilometers. Craters about 100 kilometers in diameter cover the\r\n    surface uniformly. Many have bright rims, perhaps composed of\r\n    exposed water-ice. There are very few craters larger than 150\r\n    kilometers in diameter, however, indicating that the scars of very\r\n    large impacts do not survive on the surface of Callisto.\r\n    [P-21746B/W]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The concentric rings surrounding Valhalla are perhaps\r\n    the most distinctive geological feature on Callisto. This Voyager 1\r\n    close-up shows a segment of the ridged terrain. The presence of\r\n    superposed impact craters shows that the rings formed early in\r\n    Callisto’s history; however, the density of craters is less here\r\n    than on other parts of the satellite, where the surface is older.\r\n    [P-22194]]\r\n\r\nWe who live on Earth tend not to realize the importance of cratering,\r\nfor the simple reason that our planet has very few craters, and these\r\nare frequently of volcanic rather than meteoric origin. Why are we so\r\nfavored? Is there an invisible shield to protect us from the cosmic\r\nshooting gallery? Clearly not; the Earth has experienced just as many\r\ncratering impacts as has the Moon or other planets. The difference is\r\nnot that craters are formed less often, but that the great geological\r\nactivity of Earth—erosion, volcanism, mountain building, continental\r\ndrift, etc.—erases craters as fast as they are formed. On the average, a\r\n10-kilometer-wide crater is formed on Earth about once every million\r\nyears, but all those older than a few million years have been eroded\r\naway, filled in, or crushed beyond recognition by crustal motion.\r\n\r\nIf a planet lacks great internal geologic forces, large craters can\r\nsurvive almost indefinitely. Such is the case for the Moon. Most of the\r\nvolcanism and other activity on the Moon ceased 3½ billion years ago, as\r\nthe dating of lunar samples obtained by the Apollo astronauts showed.\r\nSince that time, the lunar surface has been passively accumulating\r\nimpact scars. The longer any particular surface area has been exposed,\r\nthe more densely packed are the craters. Thus crater density is the\r\nfirst thing a planetary geologist looks for in photos of a new world.\r\nCraters are the touchstone of this field, revealing the degree of\r\ninternal activity and allowing the determination of the relative ages of\r\ndifferent surface units.\r\n\r\nOn Callisto the density of craters is very high. In some places they are\r\npacked as closely as one can imagine, particularly for craters several\r\ntens of kilometers in diameter. Although no one knows the exact rate of\r\nformation of impact craters on the Jovian satellites, geologists on the\r\nVoyager Imaging Team estimate that it would require several billion\r\nyears to accumulate the number of craters found on Callisto. They\r\ntherefore conclude that Callisto has been geologically inactive almost\r\nsince the time of its formation.\r\n\r\nAlthough superficially similar to the heavily cratered surfaces of the\r\nMoon and Mercury, Callisto is far from identical to these rocky worlds.\r\nOne of the most obvious differences is a lack of craters larger than\r\nabout 150 kilometers on Callisto, together with a tendency for large\r\ncraters to have much shallower depths. Apparently the ice-rock\r\ncomposition of Callisto alters the ability of the crust to retain large\r\ncraters. Geologists speculate that the ice flows over many millions of\r\nyears, filling in crater floors and gradually obliterating the largest\r\ncraters. There is also a conspicuous absence of mountains on Callisto,\r\nagain suggestive of a weak, icy crust.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The IRIS instrument measured the temperature of spots\r\n    on the surface of Callisto as each Voyager sped past. The\r\n    measurements shown here were all made at equatorial latitudes\r\n    (between -10° and 25°). Shown are very low predawn temperatures\r\n    (-190° C) followed by an increase to a noon-time maximum of about\r\n    -120° C, and then a drop again as the Sun sets. [260-735]]\r\n\r\nThe most prominent features in the Voyager pictures are the ghost\r\nremnants of what must have been immense impact basins. The largest of\r\nthese, the “bullseye” of the Voyager 1 images, has been named Valhalla,\r\nfor the home of the Norse gods. These ghost basins have lost nearly all\r\ntheir vertical relief. What remains is a central, light-colored zone\r\n(probably the location of the original crater), surrounded by numerous\r\nconcentric rings of subdued, bright ridges. Such features had never been\r\nseen before on any planet, and they appear to be the characteristic\r\ngeologic feature of an ice-rock planet.\r\n\r\nLittle is known about the composition of Callisto’s surface, the\r\nmaterial from which sunlight is reflected. It appears to be primarily\r\ndark rock or soil, but it lacks diagnostic spectral features, except for\r\none infrared band due to water molecules bound in the soil. The many\r\nlighter spots and arcs that outline craters in the high-resolution\r\npictures may be regions in which the ice is showing through, but these\r\ncover only a very small fraction of the exposed surface. (It should be\r\nnoted that, although Callisto is the darkest of the Galilean satellites,\r\nthe term “dark” is relative, for even Callisto is brighter than Earth’s\r\nmoon.)\r\n\r\nThe daytime surface temperature of Callisto, observed both from the\r\nground and by Voyager, is about -118° C. The Voyager infrared\r\ninterferometer spectrometer also determined the minimum temperature,\r\nreached just before dawn, of -193° C. No atmosphere is expected at these\r\ncold temperatures, and none was seen.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of Voyager images provided an improved diameter for Callisto of\r\n4840 kilometers, yielding an average density of 1.8 grams per cubic\r\ncentimeter. As noted previously, it is this low density that leads to\r\nthe conclusion that ice or water is an important component of the\r\ninterior of Callisto. The ice has never been detected directly, but the\r\npeculiar nature of the craters seen by Voyager adds strong\r\ncircumstantial support to this conclusion.\r\n\r\nCallisto, with its heavy cratering, is the most familiar-looking of the\r\nGalilean satellites; if all of them had turned out to be as geologically\r\ndead as Callisto, planetary geologists would certainly have been\r\ndisappointed. However, each satellite, progressing in toward Jupiter,\r\npresents increasing evidence of internal activity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                Ganymede\r\n\r\nThe largest of the Galilean satellites (5270 kilometers in diameter),\r\nGanymede was expected to be similar to Callisto in many ways. Both have\r\nlow densities (for Ganymede, 1.9 grams per cubic centimeter), indicating\r\na bulk composition of about half rocky materials and half water. In\r\naddition, their diameters differ by only eight percent, and both are far\r\nenough from Jupiter to escape the severe pounding Io receives from\r\nmagnetospheric charged particles. Thus it was with great interest that\r\nVoyager scientists looked at the differences that emerged between these\r\ntwo satellites.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Shaded relief map of Ganymede. [260-673]]\r\n\r\nThe surface of Ganymede as revealed by the Voyager cameras is one of\r\ngreat diversity, indicating differing periods of geologic activity. At\r\none extreme there are numerous dark areas that resemble the surface of\r\nCallisto in both albedo (reflectivity) and crater density. The largest\r\nof these, Regio Galileo, stretches from the equator to latitude +45° and\r\nis 4000 kilometers across, nearly as large as the continental United\r\nStates. This ancient terrain even preserves the remnants of a\r\nCallisto-type impact basin in the form of a system of parallel, curving,\r\nsubdued ridges about 10 kilometers wide, 100 meters high, and spaced\r\nabout 50 kilometers apart. The central part of this ghost basin is\r\nmissing, however; it was presumably destroyed by subsequent geologic\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nOther regions of the surface of Ganymede are clearly the product of\r\nintense internal geologic activity. Generally, these regions are of\r\nhigher albedo and consist of many straight parallel lines of mountains\r\nand valleys. The Voyager geologists call these the grooved terrain\r\nbecause of their appearance from a great distance. Typically, these\r\nmountain ridges are 10-15 kilometers across and about 1000 meters high,\r\nsimilar in scale to some sections of the Appalachian Mountains in the\r\nEastern United States. No higher relief exists, presumably for the same\r\nreason it is absent on Callisto. In many places the grooved terrain\r\nforms between areas of the older, darker surface, giving the appearance\r\nof mountains extruded between separating plates of ancient crust. In\r\nother areas the relationships are much more complex, with curved systems\r\nof grooves and ridges overlying each other, displaying intricate\r\ncrosscutting relationships. Apparently Ganymede has experienced a series\r\nof mountain-building events.\r\n\r\nThe grooved terrains show a substantial range in age, as indicated by\r\nthe crater densities. The oldest have nearly the same density as the\r\nancient, dark plains, suggesting that formation of the grooved terrain\r\nbegan early, perhaps 4 billion years ago. The youngest grooved terrain\r\nhas only about one-tenth as many craters, but this is still as many as\r\nare seen in the 3.5-billion-year-old lunar plains. The Voyager\r\ngeologists believe that even in these areas geologic activity ceased\r\nbillions of years ago.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The hemisphere of Ganymede that faces away from the\r\n    Sun displays a great variety of terrain. In this Voyager 2 mosaic,\r\n    photographed at a range of 300 000 kilometers, the ancient dark area\r\n    of Regio Galileo lies at the upper left. Below it, the lighter\r\n    grooved terrain forms bands of varying width, separating older\r\n    surface units. On the right edge, a prominent crater ray system is\r\n    probably caused by water-ice splashed out in a relatively recent\r\n    impact. [260-671]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The sinuous nature of some of the narrower Ganymede\r\n    groove systems can be seen in this oblique view, obtained on March 5\r\n    by Voyager 1. The area shown is about the size of California, with\r\n    features visible as small as 5 kilometers across. The ridges appear\r\n    to be the result of deformation of the crust of Ganymede. [P-21235]]\r\n\r\nOther types of surfaces are seen on Ganymede. Some regions are lightly\r\ncratered and smooth, with no indication of mountain building. In one\r\nplace, there is a rough mountainous area that looks more like the\r\njumbled lunar mountains than the long ridges and valleys of the rest of\r\nGanymede. Many of the larger craters are distinguished by brilliant\r\nwhite halos and rays that suggest that impacts may have splashed large\r\nquantities of water or ice over the surface.\r\n\r\nMany of the geologic features seen on Ganymede appear to have been\r\ncaused by breaking, faulting, or spreading of the crust. In a few cases,\r\nthere even seem to be indications of transverse, or sideways, motion\r\nalong faults. This evidence is extremely exciting to geologists, since\r\nsimilar crustal motion on Earth is associated with the drift of\r\ncontinental plates, drawn by convection currents deep in the mantle.\r\nSuch activity has never been seen before on another planet.\r\n\r\nAstronomers on Earth had known since 1971 that about half the surface of\r\nGanymede was covered with exposed water ice and about half with darker\r\nrock. An examination of the albedo variations in the Voyager pictures\r\nsuggests that the ice is exposed near large craters and, to a lesser\r\nextent, in the grooved terrain, but no direct measurements were made by\r\nVoyager of the composition of different parts of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe presence of ice on the surface suggested to many astronomers that\r\nGanymede might have a very tenuous atmosphere of water vapor or oxygen,\r\nwhich might be released by the breakdown of water vapor by sunlight.\r\nDuring the Voyager 1 flyby, a sensitive test for an atmosphere was made\r\nby the ultraviolet instrument from observations of the star Kappa\r\nCentauri as it was occulted by Ganymede. No dimming of the starlight was\r\nseen, yielding an upper limit for the surface pressure of the gases\r\noxygen, water vapor, or carbon dioxide of 10⁻¹¹ bar, or one\r\nhundred-billionth the atmospheric pressure at Earth.\r\n\r\nThe differences between the geologic histories of Ganymede and Callisto\r\nare surprisingly large. No one knows the reason. Perhaps only a small\r\nincrease in internal temperature is necessary to initiate geologic\r\nactivity in an icy planet, and for some reason Ganymede crossed this\r\nthreshold for a part of its history, whereas Callisto did not.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The complex patterns of the grooved terrain on\r\n    Ganymede are apparent in high-resolution images. This picture, taken\r\n    by Voyager 1 on March 5, has a resolution of about 3 kilometers and\r\n    shows a region about the size of the state of Pennsylvania. The\r\n    mountain ridges are spaced about 10 to 15 kilometers apart and rise\r\n    about 1000 meters, similar to many of the mountains of Pennsylvania.\r\n    The transections of different mountain systems indicate that they\r\n    formed at different times. A degraded crater near the left center of\r\n    the picture is crossed by ridges, indicating that it predated the\r\n    period of crustal deformation and mountain building. [P-21279]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Ray systems of exposed water-ice are visible in this\r\n    high-resolution mosaic of Ganymede, obtained by Voyager 2 on July 9\r\n    at a range of about 100 000 kilometers. The rough mountainous\r\n    terrain at lower right is the outer portion of a large fresh impact\r\n    basin that postdates most of the other terrain. At the bottom,\r\n    portions of grooved terrain transect other portions, indicating an\r\n    age sequence. The dark patches of heavily cratered terrain (right\r\n    center) are probably ancient icy material formed prior to the\r\n    grooved terrain. The large rayed crater at upper center is about 150\r\n    kilometers in diameter. [P-21770B/W]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The many variants of smooth and grooved terrain on\r\n    Ganymede suggest a complex geologic history for this satellite.

This was an\r\nunexpected effect. Callisto and Ganymede were expected to have unusual\r\nproperties as a result of their large percentage of ice. The densities\r\nof Europa and Io are more normal for the smaller, terrestrial-type\r\nplanets, and before Voyager many scientists expected these two\r\nsatellites might look much like the Moon, which they resemble in size.\r\n\r\nEuropa, with a diameter of 3130 kilometers, is about 15 percent smaller\r\nthan the Moon. Its density is 3.0 grams per cubic centimeter, indicating\r\na basically rocky composition. However, cosmic mixtures of rocky and\r\nmetallic materials are often a bit denser than this, leaving room for a\r\nsubstantial component of ice or water. Calculations indicate that if all\r\nthe ice were at the surface, it might form a crust up to 100 kilometers\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Shaded relief map of Europa. [260-659]]\r\n\r\nTelescopic observations of Europa demonstrated long before Voyager that\r\nthis satellite is almost completely covered with ice. It is a white,\r\nhighly reflecting body, looking, from a great distance, like a giant\r\nsnowball. In the early Voyager pictures, Europa always showed a bland,\r\nwhite disk, in striking contrast to the spottiness of Ganymede or the\r\nbrilliant colors of Io.\r\n\r\nVoyager 1 never got closer to Europa than 734 000 kilometers, and at\r\nthat distance it remained a nearly featureless planet, with no obvious\r\nimpact craters or other familiar geologic structures. What did show in\r\nthe Voyager 1 pictures, however, were numerous thin, straight dark lines\r\ncrisscrossing the surface, some extending up to 3000 kilometers in\r\nlength. To the members of the Imaging Team, these features were\r\n“strongly suggestive of global-scale tectonic processes, induced either\r\nexternally (as by tidal despinning) or internally (as by convection).”\r\nIt was with the greatest interest that the Voyager 2 images, taken from\r\nabout four times closer, were anticipated.\r\n\r\nThe spectacular pictures obtained of the satellite in July were perhaps\r\nmore confusing than clarifying. Europa is entirely covered with dark\r\nstreaks that vary in width from several kilometers to approximately 70\r\nkilometers and in length from several hundred to several thousand\r\nkilometers. Most streaks are straight, but others are curved or\r\nirregular. The streaks lie on otherwise smooth, bright terrain,\r\nfeatureless except for numerous random dark spots, most less than 10\r\nkilometers in diameter.\r\n\r\nVoyager 2 photos showed, in addition to the smooth terrain with its dark\r\nstreaks, regions of darker, mottled terrain. This mottled terrain\r\nappears rough on a small scale, and it may contain small craters just on\r\nthe limit of resolution (about 4 kilometers). Only three definite impact\r\ncraters have been identified, each about 20 kilometers across. This\r\nsmall number of craters suggests either that the surface is relatively\r\nyoung or that craters are not preserved for long in the icy crust.\r\n\r\nAlthough the dark streaks give Europa a cracked appearance, the streaks\r\nthemselves are not obviously cracks. They are not depressed below their\r\nsurroundings; in fact, they have no topographic structure whatever.\r\nEuropa is extraordinarily smooth, and the dark streaks look rather like\r\nmarks made with a felt-tipped pen on a white billiard ball. The streaks\r\nare not even very dark; the contrast with adjacent smooth terrain is\r\nonly about 10 percent.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable geologic phenomena discovered by Voyager is\r\nthe light streaks that appear on Europa. These are smaller than the dark\r\nstreaks, only about 10 kilometers in width, but much more uniform. Seen\r\nat low Sun angle, they also show vertical relief of less than a few\r\nhundred meters. These light ridges are seen best at low Sun and tend to\r\nbe invisible at higher illumination angles.\r\n\r\nThe most amazing thing about the light ridges is their form. Instead of\r\nbeing straight, they form scallops or cusps, with smooth curves that\r\nrepeat regularly on a scale of 100 to a few hundred kilometers. In some\r\nof the low-Sun-angle pictures, the surface of Europa seems to be covered\r\nwith a beautiful network of these regular curving lines. The impression\r\nis so bizarre that one tends not to believe the reality of what is seen.\r\nNothing remotely like it has ever been seen on any other planet.\r\n\r\nAt present the geology of Europa remains beyond our understanding.\r\nPresumably there is a thick ice crust, perhaps floating on a liquid\r\nwater ocean. Presumably there is sufficient heat coming from the\r\ninterior to have produced cracking or motion in the ice crust, and the\r\nlight and dark streaks preserve a pattern in some way related to this\r\ninternal activity. However, the actual mechanisms for producing the\r\nobserved features so lightly traced on this smooth white world remain\r\nfor scientists to decipher.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Europa looks like a cracked egg in this computer\r\n    mosaic of the best Voyager 2 images. In this presentation, the\r\n    variation of surface brightness due to the angle of the Sun has been\r\n    removed by computer processing, so that surface features can be seen\r\n    equally well at all places. The many broad dark streaks show up\r\n    well, but this presentation does not bring out the much fainter and\r\n    more enigmatic light streaks. These pictures were taken from a\r\n    distance of about 250 000 kilometers and show features as small as 5\r\n    kilometers across. [260-686]]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   Io\r\n\r\nThe most spectacular of the Galilean satellites is Io. Even in\r\nlow-resolution images, its brilliant colors of red, orange, yellow, and\r\nwhite set it apart from any other planet. The dramatic scale of its\r\nvolcanic activity confirms that Io is in a class by itself as the most\r\ngeologically active planetary body in the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe diameter of Io is 3640 kilometers, and its density is 3.5 grams per\r\ncubic centimeter. Both values are nearly identical to those of our Moon.\r\nWere it not for Io’s proximity to Jupiter, it would probably be a dead,\r\nrocky world much like Earth’s satellite.\r\n\r\nCareful examination of all the Voyager images of Io, some of which have\r\nresolutions as good as 1 kilometer, has failed to reveal a single impact\r\ncrater. Yet the flux of crater-producing impacts at Io must be even\r\ngreater than for the other Galilean satellites, because of the focusing\r\neffect of Jupiter’s gravity. The absence of craters alone would indicate\r\nthat Io has an extremely young and dynamic planetary surface, even\r\nwithout the observation of active volcanoes. Calculations indicate that\r\ncraters on Io must be filled in or otherwise obliterated at a rate\r\ncorresponding to the deposition of at least 100 meters per million\r\nyears, and quite probably a factor of ten greater, or 1 meter every\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: One of the most remarkable of all the Voyager\r\n    discoveries was the arcuate white ridges on Europa. Visible only at\r\n    very low Sun angle, these curved bright streaks are 5 to 10\r\n    kilometers wide and rise at most a few hundred meters above the\r\n    surface. Their graceful scalloped pattern is unique to this planet\r\n    and has defied explanation. Also visible in this view, taken by\r\n    Voyager 2 on July 9 at a range of 225 000 kilometers, are dark\r\n    bands, more diffuse than the light ridges, typically 20 to 40\r\n    kilometers wide and hundreds to thousands of kilometers long.\r\n    [P-21766]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Shaded relief map of Io as it appeared in early March\r\n    1979.

A great variety of color and albedo is\r\n    seen on the surface, now thought to be the result of surface\r\n    deposits of various forms of sulfur and sulfur dioxide. The two\r\n    great volcanoes Pele and Loki (upper left) are prominent. [260-464]]\r\n\r\nIn place of impact craters, the surface of Io has a great many volcanic\r\ncenters, which generally take the form of black spots a few tens of\r\nkilometers across. In a few cases, high-resolution pictures show the\r\ncharacteristic shapes associated with volcanic calderas on Earth and\r\nMars, and, if the other volcanic centers are similar, about 5 percent of\r\nthe entire surface of Io is occupied by calderas. These are extremely\r\nblack, reflecting less than 5 percent of the sunlight; often they are\r\nsurrounded by irregular, diffuse halos nearly as black as the central\r\nspot. The calderas seem more like the Valles caldera in New Mexico,\r\nwhich is associated with vents that produced large quantities of ash,\r\nthan with those of Hawaiian-type shield volcanic mountains.\r\n\r\nThere is evidence in many of the Voyager photos of extensive surface\r\nflows on Io. These originate in dark volcanic centers and either spread\r\nto fan shapes, typically 100 kilometers across, or else snake out in\r\nlong, twisting tentacles. Some of the flows are lighter than the\r\nbackground and some are darker. Most are red or orange in color, often\r\noutlined by fringes of contrasting albedo.\r\n\r\nThe equatorial regions of Io are quite flat, with no vertical relief\r\ngreater than about 1 kilometer high; indeed, many of the volcanic\r\ncenters do not appear to correspond to mountains or domes at all. There\r\nare, however, a number of long, curvilinear cliffs or scarps and narrow,\r\nstraight-walled valleys a few hundred meters deep. These appear to be\r\nplaces in which the crust has broken under tension, somewhat similar to\r\nterrestrial faults and the valleys called graben. A few rugged mountains\r\nof uncertain origin are visible in low Sun elevation pictures.\r\n\r\nNear the poles of Io the terrain is more irregular. There are few\r\nvolcanic centers, but more mountains, some with heights of several\r\nkilometers. In addition, there are regions that appear to be made of\r\nstacked layers of material. These so-called layered terrains are\r\nrevealed when erosion cuts into them, exposing the layers along the\r\ncliff or scarp. The largest such plateau or mesa has an area of about\r\n100 000 square kilometers. The scarps sometimes intersect each other,\r\nsuggesting a complex history of deposition, faulting, and erosion.\r\nVoyager geologists believe that these scarps may be areas in which the\r\nrelease of liquid sulfur or sulfur dioxide has undercut cliffs,\r\nanalogous to internal sapping by groundwater at similar scarps on Earth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most distinctive surface features on Io are the circular or\r\noval albedo markings that surround the great volcanoes. The first of\r\nthese to be seen was the 300-kilometer-wide white donut of Prometheus,\r\non the equator at longitude 150°. Much more spectacular is the hoofprint\r\nof Pele, about 700 by 1000 kilometers. These symmetric rings mark the\r\nlocations of the kinds of eruptions that generate large fountains or\r\nplumes, and may be produced by condensible sulfur or sulfur dioxide\r\nraining down from the volcanic fountain. At least one new ring appeared\r\nduring the four months between the Voyager encounters, centered at\r\nlongitude 330°, latitude +20°, but by the time Voyager 2 photographed\r\nthis area, no plume remained active.\r\n\r\nDuring the Voyager 1 flyby, temperature scans of the surface of Io were\r\nmade with the infrared interferometer spectrometer (IRIS). A number of\r\nlocalized warm regions were found, the most dramatic being just south of\r\nthe volcano Loki. Here the images showed a strange, U-shaped black\r\nfeature about 200 kilometers across. The IRIS team interpreted its data\r\nto indicate a temperature for the black feature of 17° C (or room\r\ntemperature), in contrast to the surrounding surface at -146° C. Perhaps\r\nthe dark feature was some sort of lava lake, either of molten rock or\r\nmolten sulfur. The melting point of sulfur is 112° C. If there were a\r\nscum of solidifying sulfur on top of the “lake,” this interpretation\r\nmight well be the correct one.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant reds and yellows of the surface of Io immediately suggest\r\nthe presence of sulfur. When heated to different temperatures and\r\nsuddenly cooled, sulfur can assume many colors, ranging from black\r\nthrough various shades of red to its normal light-yellow appearance.\r\n\r\nEven before Voyager, laboratory studies had shown that sulfur matches\r\nthe overall properties of the spectrum of Io, including the low albedo\r\nin the ultraviolet and the high reflectivity throughout the infrared.\r\nContemporary with the Voyager flybys, additional telescopic observations\r\nand laboratory studies by Fraser Fanale at JPL and Dale Cruikshank at\r\nthe University of Hawaii identified another component on Io, sulfur\r\ndioxide. Sulfur dioxide is an acrid gas released from terrestrial\r\nvolcanoes, where it combines with water in the Earth’s atmosphere to\r\nproduce sulfuric acid. At the temperature of the surface of Io, sulfur\r\ndioxide is a white solid. Researchers guessed that the extensive bright\r\nwhite areas in the Voyager pictures of Io might be covered with sulfur\r\ndioxide frost or snow. The presence of this material on Io was confirmed\r\nwhen the infrared IRIS instrument obtained a spectrum of sulfur dioxide\r\ngas over the erupting volcano Loki during the Voyager 1 encounter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Close-ups of Io reveal a wide variety of volcanic\r\n    phenomena. This Voyager 1 view of an equatorial region near\r\n    longitude 300° shows several large surface flows that originate in\r\n    volcanic craters or calderas. At the right edge is a light flow\r\n    about 250 kilometers long. Another dark, lobate flow with bright\r\n    edges is just left of center, with an exceedingly dark caldera to\r\n    its left. [260-468A]]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the ongoing eruptions on Io, made shortly after the\r\nVoyager 1 flyby, did much to clarify the confused evidence pouring in\r\nconcerning the apparent youth of Io’s surface. Here, under the very eyes\r\nof Voyager, eruptions were taking place on a scale that dwarfed anything\r\never seen before. The discovery picture alone, taken from a distance of\r\n4 million kilometers, showed two eruptions (Pele and Loki), each of\r\nwhich was much larger than the most violent volcanic eruption ever\r\nrecorded on Earth.\r\n\r\nVoyager 1 found eight giant eruptions, with fountains or plumes rising\r\nto heights of between 70 and 280 kilometers. To reach these altitudes,\r\nthe material must have been ejected from the vents at speeds of between\r\n300 and 1000 meters per second, several times greater than the highest\r\nejection velocities from terrestrial volcanoes. Although widely spaced\r\nin longitude, these volcanoes were concentrated toward the equator;\r\nseven of the eight were at latitudes between +30° and -30°, and the\r\neighth at -44°.\r\n\r\nWhen Voyager 2 arrived four months later, it was able to reobserve seven\r\nof the eight volcanoes. (To be identified reliably, the volcanic plumes\r\nmust be silhouetted against dark space at the edge of the disk.) Six of\r\nthese were still erupting; one, Pele, the largest plume seen by Voyager\r\n1, had ceased activity. The plume associated with Loki had also changed\r\nmarkedly, increasing in height from 100 to 210 kilometers in visible\r\nlight. (All the plumes appear larger when viewed in the ultraviolet.)\r\nLoki had developed a more complex structure; in March it appeared to\r\noriginate near the south end of a 250-kilometer-long dark feature, but\r\nin July there was a double plume, with activity at both ends of the dark\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Differences in surface elevation can clearly be seen\r\n    in a few of the Io close-ups from Voyager 1. This remarkable picture\r\n    is of the center of the great volcano Pele, at latitude 15°S and\r\n    longitude 224°. A low mountain with flow features can be seen. In\r\n    the background, there are several large irregular depressions with\r\n    flat floors that appear to be the result of collapse. The diffuse\r\n    dark features in the center are probably the ejecta plumes being\r\n    erupted from the Pele vent. [P-21220B/W]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: At the highest resolution obtained by the Voyager\r\n    cameras, Io revealed some landscapes that looked familiar to\r\n    terrestrial geologists. This picture, taken by Voyager 1 at a range\r\n    of only 31 000 kilometers, shows a region about the size of the\r\n    state of Maryland at a resolution of 300 meters.

This volcano is located at about\r\n    longitude 330°, latitude 70°S. [260-502]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: In addition to its giant volcanic plumes or\r\n    fountains, Io possesses other indications of current volcanic\r\n    activity. One of these takes the form of intermittent blue-white\r\n    patches that may be caused by gas venting from the interior. In this\r\n    pair of photographs, the same region of the surface is shown about\r\n    six hours apart. On the right, there is an arcuate bright gas cloud;\r\n    on the left the same region is black. It is believed that the\r\n    venting gas is sulfur dioxide, and that the condensation of this gas\r\n    produces fine particles of “snow” that look blue. [260-508]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Some of the most dramatic changes in the surface of\r\n    Io between March and July took place in the vicinity of the volcano\r\n    Loki, at longitude 310° and latitude 15°N. On the left is a Voyager\r\n    1 view; on the right, one from Voyager 2. The “lava lake” associated\r\n    with Loki has become less distinct, apparently as a result of\r\n    deposits that fell on the northern part of the dark U-shaped\r\n    feature. Perhaps the surface had also cooled between these photos.\r\n    In the upper left center, a new dark volcanic caldera with bright\r\n    spots near it and a large, faint bright ring had appeared by July,\r\n    although it was not active at the time Voyager 2 flew by.\r\n    [260-687AC]]\r\n\r\nNo new eruptions were seen by Voyager 2; between them, the two\r\nspacecraft effectively surveyed the whole surface of Io for plumes down\r\nto 40 kilometers height. Interestingly, the smallest plume seen was 70\r\nkilometers high; there appeared to be a real absence of smaller\r\neruptions.\r\n\r\nFrom the number and size of the observed eruptions, it is possible to\r\ncalculate the resurfacing rate for Io due to these plumes. The result is\r\nthat each plume is erupting about 10 000 tons of material per second, or\r\nmore than 100 billion tons per year. This quantity corresponds to about\r\n10 meters of deposition over the whole surface in a million years. When\r\nadditional note is taken of surface flows, the deposition rate could\r\neasily be ten times higher, or 100 meters per million years, in\r\nagreement with the rate estimated from the absence of impact craters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Energy for the Io Volcanoes\r\n\r\nClearly, something extraordinary is happening to Io to generate the\r\nobserved level of volcanism. The primary heat source for the interiors\r\nof the terrestrial planets is the decay of the long-lived radioactive\r\nelements thorium and uranium. But Io would have to be supplied with a\r\nhundred times its quota of these elements to explain the observed\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nA way out of this difficulty was provided by a theoretical investigation\r\ncarried out by Stanton Peale of the University of California at Santa\r\nBarbara and Pat Cassen and Ray Reynolds at the NASA Ames Research\r\nLaboratory. Working in the months before the first Voyager flyby, they\r\ncalculated that the tidal effects of Jupiter on Io could generate\r\nlarge-scale heating of the satellite. Io is about the same distance from\r\nJupiter as the Moon from Earth, but the much greater mass of Jupiter\r\nraises enormous tides in its satellite. These tides distort its shape,\r\nbut no other effect would be present if Io remained at a constant\r\ndistance from Jupiter. What Peale, Cassen, and Reynolds realized was\r\nthat the distance of Io from Jupiter varies as the result of small\r\ngravitational perturbations from the other Galilean satellites.\r\nTherefore the tidal distortions also vary, in effect squeezing and\r\nunsqueezing Io each orbit. Such flexing pumps energy into the interior\r\nof Io in the form of heat; theorists calculated that the heat supplied\r\ncould be as high as 10¹³ watts. They predicted, in a paper published\r\njust three days before the Voyager flyby of Io, that “widespread and\r\nrecurrent surface volcanism might occur,” and that “consequences of a\r\nlargely molten interior may be evident in pictures of Io’s surface\r\nreturned by Voyager.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Voyager 2 obtained beautiful views of the volcanic\r\n    eruptions during its ten-hour Io volcano watch on July 9.

The blue color is probably the result of sunlight\r\n    scattered by tiny particles of sulfur dioxide snow condensing in the\r\n    erupting plume.

[260-642B]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: When this Voyager 1 picture was taken, the main\r\n    eruptive activity (P₂) came from the lower left of the dark linear\r\n    feature (perhaps a rift) in the center. Below it is the “lava lake,”\r\n    a U-shaped dark area about 200 kilometers across. In this specially\r\n    processed image, detail can be seen in the dark surface of this\r\n    feature, possibly due to “icebergs” of solid sulfur in a liquid\r\n    sulfur lake.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: (Bottom) The IRIS on Voyager 1 found this “lava lake”\r\n    to be the hottest region on Io, with a temperature about 150° C\r\n    higher than that of the surrounding area.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: One model for the structure of Io indicates that an\r\n    ocean of liquid sulfur with a solid sulfur crust covers most of the\r\n    satellite. Heat escapes from the interior in the form of lava, which\r\n    erupts beneath the sulfur ocean. Secondary eruptions in the sulfur\r\n    ocean heat liquid sulfur dioxide, which is mixed with solid sulfur\r\n    in the crust. The rapid expansion of sulfur dioxide gas then\r\n    produces the great eruptive plumes, which consist of a mixture of\r\n    solid sulfur, sulfur dioxide gas, and sulfur dioxide snow.]\r\n\r\n  Solid sulfur + solid SO₂\r\n  Solid sulfur + liquid SO₂\r\n  Molten sulfur\r\n  Solid silicate\r\n\r\nThe Voyager observations appear to confirm the theoretical calculations.\r\nThe tidal heat source has presumably been acting since Io was formed\r\nmore than 4 billion years ago. With a totally molten interior and\r\ncontinuing large-scale volcanism, Io has had an opportunity to\r\nthoroughly sort out its composition. In the process it would have lost\r\nall the volatile gases such as water and carbon dioxide, explaining why\r\nIo now has no appreciable atmosphere in spite of the outpouring of\r\nmaterial from the interior. In addition, most of the sulfur from the\r\ninterior could have risen to the surface, where it would be constantly\r\nrecycled through volcanic activity.\r\n\r\nThe presence of large amounts of sulfur on the surface may help explain\r\nthe extraordinary nature of the Io volcanoes. One model considered for\r\nthe satellite postulates that it is covered by a sea of liquid sulfur\r\nseveral kilometers deep, with a crust of solid sulfur and, below the\r\nsurface, liquid sulfur dioxide. Calculations by Sue Kieffer of the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey and others indicate that the expansion of the sulfur\r\ndioxide in such a model can explain the observed eruption velocities of\r\nup to a kilometer per second.\r\n\r\nThe volcanic plumes on Io appear to be made primarily of sulfur and\r\nsulfur dioxide. Both are molten as they emerge from the vent, but they\r\nquickly cool as the plume rises 100 or more kilometers into the near\r\nvacuum of space. Unlike terrestrial volcanoes, there is almost no gas in\r\nthe plumes. It requires about half an hour for the fine particles of\r\nsolidified sulfur and sulfur dioxide snow to fall back to the surface,\r\nwhere they form the colorful rings that mark the major eruptive sites.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the roughly 100 000 tons of material erupted each second by\r\nthe Io volcanoes snows back to the surface. But apparently a\r\npart—perhaps 10 tons per second—escapes from Io and is captured by the\r\nJovian magnetosphere. Another part contributes to an ionosphere—a\r\ntenuous atmosphere of electrons and ions—that surrounds Io. The\r\ninjection of several tons of particles each second into the\r\nmagnetosphere has dramatic consequences that can be seen even from\r\nEarth.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Direct evidence of an atmosphere on Io was obtained\r\n    during the Voyager 1 flyby by the IRIS. In the region near the\r\n    volcano Loki and its associated “lava lake,” infrared spectra\r\n    clearly showed the signature of sulfur dioxide gas. It is not known\r\n    whether this gas was a temporary feature associated with the\r\n    eruption of Loki or if it might be present on Io more generally.\r\n    Other evidence, however, points to the sulfur dioxide atmosphere as\r\n    a transient feature. A small amount of the sulfur dioxide escapes\r\n    and is broken apart by sunlight to provide the oxygen and sulfur\r\n    ions observed in the Io torus.]\r\n\r\n  Sulfur dioxide gas cloud\r\n  Plume\r\n  -235° F\r\n  Hot surface areas (45° F)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Io Torus\r\n\r\nSurrounding Jupiter at the distance of Io is a donut-shaped volume, or\r\ntorus, of plasma that originates at the satellite. At first, the atoms\r\nescaping from Io expand outward as a gas, but soon they are stripped of\r\nelectrons and become electrically charged. Some of these gases, such as\r\nsulfur dioxide, apparently originate in the large volcanic eruptions;\r\nother, such as the sodium cloud being studied with Earth-based\r\ntelescopes, result from sputtering of surface materials by energetic\r\nparticles in the magnetosphere. After they are ionized by the loss of\r\none or more electrons, the atoms are caught by the spinning magnetic\r\nfield of Jupiter and become a part of what is called a co-rotating\r\nplasma, spinning at 74 kilometers per second with the same ten-hour\r\nperiod as Jupiter itself.\r\n\r\nThe Io torus was easily detected on Voyager by the ultraviolet\r\nspectrometer, even from a distance of 150 million kilometers. The\r\nstrongest ultraviolet radiation comes from twice-ionized sulfur (atoms\r\nthat have lost two electrons) (S III), emitting a wavelength of 69\r\nnanometers or about one-eighth the wavelength of visible light. The\r\nspectrometer also detected glows from atoms of triply ionized sulfur (S\r\nIV) and twice-ionized oxygen (O III).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: At the time of the Voyager 1 encounter, the most\r\n    abundant heavy ions in the Jovian magnetosphere were sulfur and\r\n    oxygen. Multiply ionized sulfur and oxygen both emit strongly in the\r\n    ultraviolet, where they could be observed by the ultraviolet\r\n    spectrometer. This spectrum of the Io torus registers the tremendous\r\n    amount of ultraviolet energy (about a million million watts) being\r\n    radiated. To emit so strongly, the temperatures in the torus must be\r\n    near 100 000 K.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Direct measurement of the heavy ions associated with\r\n    the Io torus were made by the Voyager 1 LECP instrument. Here the\r\n    amounts of various elements are shown for two cases: the Jovian\r\n    inner magnetosphere (solid line) and a typical solar event. Both the\r\n    Jovian and the solar particles have been scaled to show similar\r\n    amounts of oxygen, but the solar particles are also rich in carbon\r\n    and iron, whereas Jupiter has a great deal of sulfur. Evidence such\r\n    as this demonstrates that the sulfur does not come from the Sun;\r\n    rather, the sulfur and most of the oxygen appear to be the product\r\n    of the Io sulfur dioxide volcanic eruptions.]\r\n\r\nScans across the torus showed that it had a thickness of 1.0 R_J and was\r\ncentered at a distance of 5.9 R_J from Jupiter. The torus is centered on\r\nthe magnetic, rather than the rotational, equator of the planet. To\r\nproduce the intense glow observed, the electron temperatures in the\r\ntorus must be 100 000 K, with an electron density of about 1000 per\r\ncubic centimeter. The brightness in the ultraviolet corresponds to a\r\nradiated power of more than a million million (10¹²) watts. This\r\nenormous amount of energy must be continuously supplied by the\r\nmagnetosphere.\r\n\r\nThe ultraviolet emissions from the Io torus seen by Voyager were\r\ndramatically different from those seen in 1973 and 1974 with the simpler\r\nultraviolet instrument on board Pioneers 10 and 11. These changes\r\ncorrespond to more than a factor of 10 in brightness. As noted by the\r\nVoyager Team, “Because of the remarkable differences we conclude that\r\nthe Jupiter-Io environment has changed significantly since December\r\n1973. The observed differences are so spectacularly large that this\r\nconclusion does not depend on a detailed comparison of the two\r\ninstruments, their calibrations, or the observing geometry.” The reason\r\nfor this change, or the degree to which it reflects a large-scale\r\nvariation in the volcanic activity of Io, is one of the major questions\r\narising from the Voyager mission.\r\n\r\nThe Io torus can also be observed from the ground. In 1976, spectra\r\nshowed the glow of singly ionized sulfur (S II), and in 1979 singly\r\nionized oxygen (O II) was detected. The observations of S II and O II\r\nare particularly interesting because they provide a measure of the\r\ndensity and temperature of the plasma. In April 1979, between the two\r\nVoyager flybys, Carl Pilcher of the University of Hawaii succeeded in\r\nobtaining a telescopic image of the torus in the light of S II. He\r\nmeasured nearly the same ring diameter (5.3-5.7 R_J) as had Voyager;\r\ninterestingly, both agree that the sulfur torus is centered slightly\r\ninside the orbit of Io (6.0 R_J).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The emission of light from sulfur ions in the Io\r\n    torus is so strong it can be measured from the Earth. In these\r\n    pictures, University of Hawaii astronomer Carl Pilcher photographed\r\n    the torus in the light of ionized sulfur on the night of April 9,\r\n    1979. As the planet rotates, the torus is seen first partly opened,\r\n    then edge-on, and again opened in the opposite direction. The dark\r\n    band on the right of each image is due to light from Jupiter\r\n    scattered in the telescope, as shown in the bottom picture, which\r\n    contains the scattered light only.]\r\n\r\nDirect measurements of the torus were made from Voyager 1 as the\r\nspacecraft passed twice through this region, once inbound and once\r\noutbound. The low energy charged particle instrument and the cosmic ray\r\ninstrument both determined that the composition of the ions in the Io\r\ntorus was primarily sulfur and oxygen. Ionized sodium was also observed.\r\nFor several years, ground-based telescope observations had revealed a\r\ncloud of neutral sodium around Io; the Voyager instruments picked up\r\nthese atoms after they had each lost an electron and become trapped in\r\nthe magnetosphere. These instruments also derived the electron and ion\r\ndensity (about 1000 per cubic centimeter) and confirmed that the ions\r\nwere co-rotating with the inner magnetosphere.\r\n\r\nAnother Io-associated phenomenon searched for by Voyager was the Io flux\r\ntube. As a conductor moving through the Jovian magnetic field, Io\r\ngenerates an electric current, estimated to have a strength of about 10\r\nmillion (10⁷) amperes and a power of the order of a million million\r\n(10¹²) watts. The region of space through which this current flows from\r\nthe satellite to Jupiter is called the flux tube.\r\n\r\nVoyager 1 was targeted to fly through the Io flux tube. This was an\r\nimportant decision, since this option precluded the possibility of\r\nobtaining occultations by either Io or Ganymede. The event was to take\r\nplace on March 5, just after closest approach to Io. The effects of the\r\nflux tube were clearly observed by the magnetometer, the LECP\r\ninstrument, and other particle and field instruments; however,\r\nsubsequent analysis indicated that the spacecraft had not penetrated the\r\nregion of maximum current flow; it probably missed the center of the\r\nflux tube between 5000 and 10 000 kilometers.\r\n\r\nThe flux tube is not the only connection between Io and Jupiter. Radio\r\nemissions from the atmosphere are triggered by Io’s orbital position,\r\nand the aurorae that illuminate Jupiter’s polar regions are the result\r\nof charged particles falling into the planet from the Io torus. Other\r\ncharged particles can occasionally escape outward and be detected as far\r\naway as Earth.\r\n\r\nIo is unquestionably a remarkable world. The only planetary body known\r\nto be geologically more active than the Earth, it provides many extreme\r\nexamples to test the theories of geoscientists. Its intimate\r\ninterconnections with the Jovian magnetosphere and the planet itself\r\nprovide a unifying theme to the complex processes taking place in the\r\ninner parts of the Jovian system.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Galileo Probe will make a fiery entry into the\r\n    Jovian atmosphere, carrying a payload of scientific instruments for\r\n    the first direct sampling of the atmosphere of a giant planet.

Both the giant planet and its system of satellites\r\nwill almost certainly play a central role in any future program of solar\r\nsystem exploration and research. Thus, even as the two Voyager\r\nspacecraft directed their attention further outward toward Saturn, NASA\r\nhad begun development of the next Jupiter mission, named Galileo.\r\n\r\nGalileo is an ambitious, multiple-vehicle planetary mission. It has two\r\nmajor interlocking elements: a probe to be placed in the atmosphere of\r\nJupiter and an orbiter to explore Jupiter, its satellites, and its\r\nmagnetosphere. By using individual satellite flybys to alter its orbit,\r\nthe Galileo spacecraft can carry out a satellite “tour” consisting of\r\nflybys of the Galilean satellites at different geometries and a deep\r\npenetration into the magnetosphere in the unexplored region of space\r\nbehind Jupiter.\r\n\r\nBoth an atmospheric probe for the planet and a long-lived orbiter to\r\nstudy the satellites and magnetosphere are logical successors to\r\nVoyager. In 1974, three years before Voyager launch, the Space Science\r\nBoard of the National Academy of Sciences was already emphasizing the\r\nscientific advantages of both of these approaches. In suggesting goals\r\nfor 1975-1985, the Board wrote, “We recommend that a significant effort\r\nin the NASA planetary program over the next decade be devoted toward the\r\nouter solar system. Jupiter is the primary object of outer solar system\r\nexploration.” Looking at specific mission goals, the Board recommended\r\nthat “the primary objectives in the exploration of Jupiter and its\r\nsatellites for the period 1975-1985 in order of importance are (1)\r\ndetermination of the chemical composition and physical state of its\r\natmosphere, (2) the chemical composition and physical state of the\r\nsatellites, and (3) the topology and behavior of the magnetic field and\r\nthe energetic particle fluxes. In order to carry out this program, it\r\nwill be necessary to utilize orbiting spacecraft and probe-delivering\r\nspacecraft.”\r\n\r\nIn the same period NASA carried out studies of two possible orbiter and\r\nprobe missions. Working through the Ames Research Center, a scientific\r\npanel chaired by James Van Allen explored the adaptation of the Pioneer\r\n10 and 11 spinning spacecraft to carry a probe to Jupiter and to carry\r\nout an orbiter mission emphasizing magnetospheric studies. William B.\r\nHubbard of the University of Arizona chaired a JPL-based panel\r\ninvestigating the use of a Mariner-class fully stabilized spacecraft\r\nsimilar to Voyager to carry out a satellite-oriented orbiter mission. In\r\n1976 these concepts were combined in a study, again chaired by Dr. Van\r\nAllen, of a Voyager-type orbiter with probe-carrying capability. This\r\nmission concept was given the name JOP, for Jupiter Orbiter Probe, and\r\nlead responsibility was assigned by NASA to JPL, with Ames carrying out\r\nthe design of the probe.\r\n\r\nIn 1977, as Voyager activity was building toward autumn launch, a\r\nstruggle was underway in Washington to obtain approval for the new\r\nJupiter orbiter and probe mission. Budgeting authority was requested in\r\nthe President’s Fiscal Year 1978 budget, but only after extensive\r\ntestimony and several Congressional votes was the mission approved. The\r\nofficial new start for JOP, soon to be renamed Galileo, was set for July\r\n1, 1977, and the scientific investigators and their instruments were\r\nselected in August.\r\n\r\nAt JPL, many members of the Voyager Team made a smooth transition to the\r\nGalileo Project. Much of the knowledge that had gone into the design of\r\nthe Voyager spacecraft and its subsystems was now incorporated into\r\nGalileo. Similarly, at Ames the knowledge gained from the design of the\r\nPioneer Venus probes, which were launched to Venus in 1978, a year after\r\nVoyager launch, was applied to design of a Jupiter probe. Among the\r\nindividuals who brought their Voyager experience to Galileo were John\r\nCasani, who left the position of Voyager Project Manager to become\r\nGalileo Project Manager, and Torrence Johnson of the Voyager Imaging\r\nTeam, who became Galileo Project Scientist.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The Scientific Capability of Galileo\r\n\r\nThe investigations of Jupiter and its system planned for the Galileo\r\nProject represented substantial advances over those carried out by\r\nVoyager. In part, this was the result of new spacecraft capabilities,\r\nparticularly the atmospheric entry probe. It also represented increasing\r\nsophistication in scientific instrumentation over the seven-year\r\ninterval between the selection of the payloads for the two missions.\r\n\r\nThe main emphasis in the study of Jupiter itself is on direct\r\nmeasurements with the Probe. For the first time it will be possible to\r\nexamine directly the atmosphere of a giant planet. By measuring the\r\ntemperature and pressure as it descends through the clouds, the Probe\r\ncan determine the structure of the atmosphere with much higher precision\r\nthan could ever be obtained from remote observations. The structure, in\r\nturn, provides information on dynamics—the circulation and heat balance\r\nof the Jovian atmosphere. In addition, the Probe can make direct\r\nmeasurements of the composition of the gases, with sensitivity in some\r\ncases to quantities as low as a few parts per billion. In addition to\r\nthe elemental abundance, the amount of different isotopes can also be\r\nmeasured.\r\n\r\nDirect studies of the clouds of Jupiter can be made from the Galileo\r\nProbe. With a device called a nephelometer (literally, cloud-meter), the\r\nsizes and compositions of individual aerosol particles will be\r\ndetermined. An infrared instrument will determine the temperatures of\r\nthe cloud layers and measure the amounts of sunlight deposited in\r\ndifferent regions of the atmosphere. Another instrument will search for\r\nlightning; it has the ability to detect both the flash of light and the\r\nradio static generated by each bolt.\r\n\r\nAdditional studies of the atmosphere, similar to those of Voyager, can\r\nbe carried out from the Galileo Orbiter. Television pictures,\r\nultraviolet and infrared spectra, and measurements of the polarization\r\nof reflected light will all be obtained with the same scan platform\r\ninstruments that are used to study the surfaces of the satellites.\r\n\r\nA full battery of fields and particles instruments is planned for the\r\nGalileo Orbiter. Many of these are direct descendants of Voyager\r\ninstruments. In general, their capabilities have been improved,\r\nparticularly their ability to determine the composition of charged\r\nparticles. There is a steady progression from Pioneer to Voyager to\r\nGalileo: The early measurements were concentrated on particle energies,\r\nbut more sophisticated instruments yield the composition of the ions and\r\nthe details of their motion.\r\n\r\nMany of the advances expected from Galileo in magnetospheric studies\r\nresult from the Orbiter’s ability to explore many parts of the\r\nenvironment of Jupiter. The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft made single\r\ncuts through the magnetosphere, and often it was difficult to\r\ndistinguish temporal from spatial effects. Galileo will repeatedly swing\r\naround Jupiter, sampling conditions at many distances from the planet\r\nover a time span of two years or more. In addition, it is planned to\r\nadjust the orbit of Galileo to swing out into the magnetotail, the\r\nturbulent region of the magnetosphere that stretches “downwind” from\r\nJupiter for hundreds of Jupiter radii. No flybys can reach the\r\nmagnetotail; an orbiting spacecraft is required.\r\n\r\nThe Galilean satellites naturally will be a primary focus of Galileo\r\nscience, particularly after Voyager. It is planned to have as many as a\r\ndozen individual encounters, most of them at much closer range than the\r\nVoyager flybys. To take advantage of these opportunities, the Galileo\r\nscan platform will carry two new remote sensing systems.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Orbiter section of the Galileo spacecraft will\r\n    carry both remote sensing and direct measuring instruments for the\r\n    study of Jupiter, its satellites, and its magnetosphere. Several\r\n    remote sensing instruments—an imagery system, a near infrared\r\n    mapping spectrometer, an ultraviolet spectrometer, and a\r\n    photopolarimeter/radiometer—will be mounted on a scan platform. The\r\n    particles and fields instruments will be on a spinning section of\r\n    the spacecraft. The Orbiter is expected to operate for at least two\r\n    years around Jupiter, providing one close flyby of Io and several\r\n    each of Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. [P-20772]]\r\n\r\nInstead of the vidicon television camera on Voyager, Galileo imaging\r\nwill be done with a new solid-state detector called a charged coupled\r\ndevice (CCD). The CCD has a wider spectral response and greater\r\nphotometric accuracy. In addition, its increased sensitivity permits\r\nshorter exposures, so that even on very close flybys the pictures will\r\nnot be blurred by spacecraft motion. Substantial coverage at a\r\nresolution of 100 meters should be possible, compared to Voyager’s best\r\nresolution of 1 kilometer for Io and 4 kilometers for Europa.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Galileo will be launched by the Space Shuttle, the\r\n    central element of the new NASA Space Transportation System.\r\n    Together with its upper stage launch rocket, Galileo will be placed\r\n    into Earth’s orbit in the large Shuttle bay, about 20 meters long\r\n    and 5 meters in diameter. After releasing Galileo, the Shuttle will\r\n    be piloted back to a landing at Cape Canaveral, to be used again for\r\n    many future flights. [5-78-23599]]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The Space Shuttle and the Inertial Upper Stage of\r\n    Galileo as they will appear in Earth orbit. The upper stage has been\r\n    released from the Shuttle bay and is being prepared for launch to\r\n    Jupiter.]\r\n\r\nTo determine the composition of satellite surface materials, Galileo\r\nwill also carry a near-infrared mapping spectrometer (NIMS). This\r\ninstrument will obtain measurements over the visible and infrared\r\nspectra of areas as small as 10 kilometers across. With NIMS, it should\r\nbe possible to investigate the composition of individual features as\r\nsmall as the volcanic calderas on Io or the ejecta blankets of\r\nGanymede’s craters.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Galileo Mission Design\r\n\r\nThe Galileo Orbiter and Probe are to be launched with NASA’s new Space\r\nShuttle and Inertial Upper Stage. To carry the maximum possible payload\r\nto Jupiter, a close flyby of Mars is planned en route. The gravitational\r\nfield of Mars will give a boost to Galileo, just as that of Jupiter was\r\nused by Voyager to swing on to Saturn.\r\n\r\nThe exact launch date and trajectory for Galileo have not yet been\r\nspecified, but if all goes well, the Orbiter spacecraft will approach\r\nJupiter from the dawn side of the planet sometime in the mid-1980s. It\r\nwill not be moving as fast as Voyager, since it must be placed into\r\norbit around Jupiter rather than flashing past on its way to the outer\r\nsolar system. On its initial trajectory, Galileo will probably come\r\nwithin 5 R_J of Jupiter, slightly closer than Voyager 1. At this time it\r\nwill fire its rocket engines (supplied by the Federal Republic of\r\nGermany in a cooperative program with NASA) to shed excess speed and let\r\nitself be captured by Jupiter’s gravity. The first pass will also be the\r\ntime for a close flyby of Io.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: The most critical period of the Galileo flight will\r\n    be the Probe entry at Jupiter. The Probe must strike the atmosphere\r\n    at precisely the correct angle and speed to be slowed down without\r\n    being destroyed. At a pressure level of about 0.1 bar the rapid\r\n    deceleration period ends and the heat shield is released. A\r\n    parachute is deployed to slow the descent further, and the Probe\r\n    then has a period of nearly an hour to study the atmosphere and\r\n    clouds of Jupiter. The Probe mission ends when its batteries run\r\n    down or when it is crushed by the pressure of the Jovian atmosphere\r\n    near the 20-bar level, whichever comes first.

To do so would risk damage to the spacecraft electronics\r\nand a premature end to the mission. Additional thruster firing during\r\nthe first orbit can be used to raise the periapse to 10 R_J or greater.\r\nNo more close passes by Io will be possible, but studies of this\r\nsatellite can be made on each subsequent orbit with imaging resolutions\r\nof about 10 kilometers, sufficient to see details of the volcanic\r\neruptions and monitor volcano-associated changes in the surface.\r\n\r\nAt each subsequent orbit, Galileo will be programmed for a close flyby\r\nof one of the other satellites. Several passes each of Callisto,\r\nGanymede, and Europa should be possible. The satellite tour does not\r\nneed to be fully planned in advance; by adjusting the spacecraft\r\ntrajectory with small bursts of the thruster motors, navigation\r\nengineers can modify the orbit to permit adaptation to scientific needs.\r\nAs the Orbiter mission progresses, the spacecraft will also sample many\r\nparts of the magnetosphere, including one long excursion, at least 150\r\nR_J, into the magnetotail.\r\n\r\nThe total duration of the Orbiter mission is planned to be at least 20\r\nmonths. Additions to the basic mission are possible if the spacecraft\r\nremains healthy and fuel reserves are adequate. In contrast, the Galileo\r\nProbe mission lasts only a few hours.\r\n\r\nAs the Probe approaches the atmosphere of Jupiter at the awesome speed\r\nof 26 kilometers per second, it will be traversing a region of space\r\nnever before explored. An energetic particle detector will investigate\r\nthe innermost magnetosphere before the entry begins. Then, within a\r\nperiod of just a few minutes, friction with the upper atmosphere must\r\ndissipate the Probe energy until it is falling gently in the Jovian air.\r\n\r\nJupiter, being the largest planet, presents the most challenging\r\natmospheric entry mission ever undertaken by NASA. The design of the\r\nGalileo Probe calls for a massive heat shield to protect the instruments\r\nduring the high-speed entry phase. After the Probe has slowed to\r\nsubsonic velocities, a parachute will be deployed, and the heat shield,\r\nhaving done its job, will be dropped free.\r\n\r\n                  GALILEO ORBITER SCIENCE INVESTIGATIONS\r\n                   Project Scientist: T.

During this time it will make most of its scientific measurements,\r\nrelaying them back to Earth via the Probe carrier. Designers expect the\r\nProbe to sink through regions of ammonia clouds, ammonium hydrosulfide\r\nclouds, and ice and water clouds during this hour.\r\n\r\nBy the time it has descended below the water clouds, the increasing\r\npressure will exceed the strength of some Probe components. Engineers\r\nexpect the Probe to have completed its mission, exhausted its battery\r\npower, and been crushed by the atmospheric pressure before the 20-bar\r\nlevel is reached. Lifeless, it will then sink on into the thick, hot\r\nlower atmosphere of Jupiter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: During its two years in orbit, the Galileo Orbiter\r\n    will carry out many investigations of the planet, the Galilean\r\n    satellites, and the Jovian magnetosphere. Repeated close flybys of\r\n    the satellites are used to modify and shape the orbit to provide\r\n    additional flybys at an optimum viewing geometry. Initially, the\r\n    orbit is a long loop that extends in the general direction of the\r\n    sunset side of Jupiter. The orbit is then contracted, and the\r\n    encounters with the satellites rotate it behind the planet for a\r\n    long excursion into the magnetotail late in the tour.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Beyond Galileo\r\n\r\nAfter Galileo, the future cannot be predicted. Perhaps there will no\r\nlonger be a program of planetary exploration. But if humanity still has\r\nthe vision to seek a future in the stars, there will surely be other\r\nJupiter missions.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the next mission will concentrate on Jupiter itself. Probes\r\ncould be built to withstand pressures as high as several hundred bars,\r\nfeeling their way deep into the murky depths of the planet. Or a hot-air\r\nballoon could be deployed from a probe to carry instruments for\r\nlong-term studies of the atmosphere. A number of proposals have also\r\nbeen made for additional satellite missions, including orbiters or\r\nlanders for Ganymede and Callisto. Or perhaps it will be desirable to\r\nland a vehicle on one of the satellites and collect a sample and return\r\nit to Earth for laboratory analysis.\r\n\r\nWhatever the future holds, it is clear that the Pioneer and Voyager\r\nmissions blazed the path to Jupiter and beyond. The little Pioneers\r\nproved that it could be done, and the Voyagers expanded their vision,\r\nexploring and discovering new worlds more remarkable and exciting than\r\nanyone could have imagined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX A\r\n               PICTORIAL MAPS OF THE GALILEAN SATELLITES\r\n\r\n\r\nThese maps were prepared for the Voyager Imaging Team by the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey in cooperation with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\r\nCalifornia Institute of Technology and the National Aeronautics and\r\nSpace Administration.
