Until comparatively recent times the rather narrow outlook and\r\nthe technical difficulties of the study made it one which could only be\r\nappreciated by specialists. This has been gradually changed, owing to the\r\ndetailed anatomical work which it was found possible to do on the\r\ncarboniferous plants, and which proved to be of great botanical\r\nimportance. About ten years ago textbooks in English were written, and\r\nthe subject was included in the work of the honours students of Botany at\r\nthe Universities. To-day the important bearing of the results of this\r\nbranch of Science on several others, as well as its intrinsic value, is\r\nso much greater, that anyone who is at all acquainted with general\r\nscience, and more particularly with Botany and Geology, must find much to\r\ninterest him in it.\r\n\r\nThere is no book in the English language which places this really\r\nattractive subject before the non-specialist, and to do so is the aim of\r\nthe present volume. The two excellent English books which we possess,\r\nviz. Seward’s _Fossil Plants_ (of which the first volume only has\r\nappeared, and that ten years ago) and Scott’s _Studies in Fossil Botany_,\r\nare ideal for advanced University students. But they are written for\r\nstudents who are supposed to have a previous knowledge of technical\r\nbotany, and prove very hard or impossible reading for those who are\r\nmerely acquainted with Science in a general way, or for less advanced\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of fossil types in the South Kensington syllabus for Botany\r\nindicates the increasing importance attached to palæobotany, and as vital\r\nfacts about several of those types are not to be found in a simply\r\nwritten book, the students preparing for the examination must find some\r\ndifficulty in getting their information. Furthermore, Scott’s book, the\r\nonly up-to-date one, does not give a complete survey of the subject, but\r\njust selects the more important families to describe in detail.\r\n\r\nHence the present book was attempted for the double purpose of presenting\r\nthe most interesting discoveries and general conclusions of recent years,\r\nand bringing together the subject as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe mass of information which has been collected about fossil plants is\r\nnow enormous, and the greatest difficulty in writing this little book has\r\nbeen the necessity of eliminating much that is of great interest. The\r\nauthor awaits with fear and trembling the criticisms of specialists, who\r\nwill probably find that many things considered by them as particularly\r\ninteresting or essential have been left out. It is hoped that they will\r\nbear in mind the scope and aim of the book. I try to present only the\r\nstructure raised on the foundation of the accumulated details of\r\nspecialists’ work, and not to demonstrate brick by brick the exposed\r\nfoundation.\r\n\r\nThough the book is not written specially for them, it is probable that\r\nUniversity students may find it useful as a general survey of the whole\r\nsubject, for there is much in it that can only be learned otherwise by\r\nreference to innumerable original monographs.\r\n\r\nIn writing this book all possible sources of information have been\r\nconsulted, and though Scott’s _Studies_[1] naturally formed the\r\nfoundation of some of the chapters on Pteridophytes, the authorities for\r\nall the general part and the recent discoveries are the numerous memoirs\r\npublished by many different learned societies here and abroad.\r\n\r\nAs these pages are primarily for the use of those who have no very\r\ntechnical preliminary training, the simplest language possible which is\r\nconsistent with a concise style has always been adopted. The necessary\r\ntechnical terms are either explained in the context or in the glossary at\r\nthe end of the book. The list of the more important authorities makes no\r\npretence of including all the references that might be consulted with\r\nadvantage, but merely indicates the more important volumes and papers\r\nwhich anyone should read who wishes to follow up the subject.\r\n\r\nAll the illustrations are made for the book itself, and I am much obliged\r\nto Mr. D. M. S. Watson, B.Sc., for the microphotos of plant anatomy which\r\nadorn its pages. The figures and diagram are my own work.\r\n\r\nThis book is dedicated to college students, to the senior pupils of good\r\nschools where the subject is beginning to find a place in the higher\r\ncourses of Botany, but especially to all those who take an interest in\r\nplant evolution because it forms a thread in the web of life whose design\r\nthey wish to trace.\r\n\r\n                                                           M.

But all the plants which are now alive are the\r\ndescendants of those which lived a few years ago, and those again came\r\ndown through generation after generation from the plants which inhabited\r\nthe world before the races of men existed. If, therefore, we wish to know\r\nand understand the vegetation living to-day we must look into the past\r\nhistories of the families of plants, and there is no way to do this at\r\nonce so simple and so direct (in theory) as to examine the remains of the\r\nplants which actually lived in that past. Yet when we come to do this\r\npractically we encounter many difficulties, which have discouraged all\r\nbut enthusiasts from attempting the study hitherto, but which in reality\r\nneed not dismay us.\r\n\r\nWhen Lindley and Hutton, in 1831, began to publish their classical book\r\n_The Fossil Flora of Great Britain_, they could give but isolated\r\nfragments of information concerning the fossils they described, and the\r\nresults of their work threw but little light on the theoretical problems\r\nof morphology and classification of living plants. Since then great\r\nadvance has been made, and now the sum of our knowledge of the subject,\r\nthough far from complete, is so considerable and has such a far-reaching\r\ninfluence that it is becoming the chief inspiration of several branches\r\nof modern botany. Of the many workers who have contributed to this stock\r\nof knowledge the foremost, as he was the pioneer in the investigations on\r\nmodern lines, is Williamson, who was a professor at Manchester\r\nUniversity, and whose monographs and specimens are classics to-day. Still\r\nliving is Dr. Scott, whose greatness is scarcely less, as well as an\r\never-increasing number of specialists in this country, who are\r\ncontinually making discoveries. Abroad, the chief Continental names are\r\nRenault, Bertrand, Count Solms Laubach, Brongniart, Zeiller; and in\r\nAmerica is Dr. Wieland; while there are innumerable other workers in the\r\nfield who have deepened and widened the channels of information. The\r\nliterature on fossil plants is now vast; so great that to give merely the\r\nnames of the publications would fill a very large volume.\r\n\r\nBut, like the records left by the plants themselves, most of this\r\nliterature is unreadable by any but specialists, and its really vital\r\ninterest is enclosed in a petrifying medium of technicalities. It is to\r\ngive their results in a more accessible form that the present volume has\r\nbeen written.\r\n\r\nThe actual plants that lived and died long ago have left either no trace\r\nof their form and character, or but imperfect fragments of some of their\r\nparts embedded in hard rock and often hidden deep in the earth. That such\r\ndifficulties lie in our way should not discourage us from attempting to\r\nlearn all the fossils can teach. Many an old manuscript which is torn and\r\npartly destroyed bears a record, the fragments of which are more\r\ninteresting and important than a tale told by a complete new book. The\r\nvery difficulty of the subject of fossil botany is in itself an incentive\r\nto study, and the obstacles to be surmounted before a view of the ancient\r\nplants can be seen increase the fascination of the journey.\r\n\r\nThe world of to-day has been nearly explored; but the world, or rather\r\nthe innumerable world-phases of the past, lie before us practically\r\nunknown, bewilderingly enticing in their mystery. These untrodden regions\r\nare revealed to us only by the fossils lying scattered through the rocks\r\nat our feet, which give us the clues to guide us along an adventurous\r\npath.\r\n\r\nFables of flying dragons and wondrous sea monsters have been shown by the\r\nstudents of animal fossils to be no more marvellous than were the actual\r\ncreatures which once inhabited the globe; and among the plants such\r\nwonderful monsters have their parallels in the floras of the past. The\r\ntrees which are living to-day are very recent in comparison with the\r\nancestors of the families of lowlier plants, and most of the modern\r\nforest trees have usurped a position which once belonged to the monster\r\nmembers of such families as the Lycopods and Equisetums, which are now\r\nhumble and dwindling. An ancient giant of the past is seen in the\r\nfrontispiece, and the great girth of its stem offers a striking contrast\r\nto the feeble trailing branches of its living relatives, the Club-mosses.\r\n\r\nAs we follow their histories we shall see how family after family has\r\nrisen to dominate the forest, and has in its turn given place to a\r\nsucceeding group. Some of the families that flourished long since have\r\nliving descendants of dwarfed and puny growth, others have died out\r\ncompletely, so that their very existence would have been unsuspected had\r\nit not been revealed by their broken fragments entombed in the rocks.\r\n\r\nFrom the study of the fossils, also, we can discover something of the\r\ncourse of the evolution of the different parts of the plant body, from\r\nthe changes it has passed through in the countless ages of its existence.\r\nJust as the dominant animals of the past had bodies lacking in many of\r\nthe characters which are most important to the living animals, so did the\r\nearly plants differ from those around us to-day. It is the comparative\r\nstudy of living and fossil structures which throws the strongest light on\r\nthe facts and factors of evolution.\r\n\r\nWhen the study of fossil organisms goes into minute detail and embraces\r\nthe fine subtleties of their internal structure, then the student of\r\nfossil plants has the advantage of the zoological observer, for in many\r\nof the fossil plants the cells themselves are petrified with a perfection\r\nthat no fossil animal tissues have yet been found to approach. Under the\r\nmicroscope the most delicate of plant cells, the patterns on their walls,\r\nand sometimes even their nuclei can be recognized as clearly as if they\r\nwere living tissues. The value of this is immense, because the external\r\nappearance of leaves and stems is often very deceptive, and only when\r\nboth external appearance and internal structure are known can a real\r\nestimate of the character of the plant be made. In the following chapters\r\na number of photographs taken through the microscope will show some of\r\nthe cell structure from fossil plants. Such figures as fig. 11 and fig.\r\n96, for example, illustrate the excellence of preservation which is often\r\nfound in petrified plant tissues. Indeed, the microscope becomes an\r\nessential part of the equipment of a fossil botanist; as it is to a\r\nstudent of living plants. But for those who are not intending to\r\nspecialize on the subject micro-photographs will illustrate sufficient\r\ndetail, while in most modern museums some excellently preserved specimens\r\nare exhibited which show their structure if examined with a magnifying\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nWe recognize to-day the effect the vegetation of a district has on its\r\nscenery, even on its more fundamental nature; and we see how the plants\r\nkeep in close harmony with the lands and waters, the climates and soils\r\nof the places they inhabit. So was it in the past. Hence the fossil\r\nplants of a district will throw much light on its physical characters\r\nduring the epoch when they were living, and from their evidence it is\r\npossible to build up a picture of the conditions of a region during the\r\nepochs of its unwritten history.\r\n\r\nFrom every point of view a student of living plants will find his\r\nknowledge and understanding of them greatly increased by a study of the\r\nfossils. Not only to the botanist is the subject of value, the geologist\r\nis equally concerned with it, though from a slightly different viewpoint,\r\nand all students of the past history of the earth will gain from it a\r\nwider knowledge of their specialty.\r\n\r\nTo all observers of life, to all philosophers, the whole history of\r\nplants, which only approaches completion when the fossils are studied,\r\nand compared or contrasted with living forms, affords a wonderful\r\nillustration of the laws of evolution on which are based most of the\r\nmodern conceptions of life. Even to those whose profession necessitates\r\npurely practical lines of thought, fossil botany has something to teach;\r\nthe study of coal, for instance, comes within its boundaries. While to\r\nall who think on the world at all, the story told by the fossil plants is\r\na chapter in the Book of Life which is as well worth reading as any in\r\nthat mystical volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                     VARIOUS KINDS OF FOSSIL PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the rocks which form the solid earth of to-day, a very large\r\nproportion have been built up from the deposits at the bottom of ancient\r\noceans and lakes. The earth is very old, and in the course of its history\r\ndry land and sea, mountains and valleys have been formed and again\r\ndestroyed on the same spot, and it is from the silt at the bottom of an\r\nocean that the hills of the future are built.\r\n\r\nThe chief key we have to the processes that were in operation in the past\r\nis the course of events passing under our eyes to-day. Hence, if we would\r\nunderstand the formation of the rocks in the ancient seas, we must go to\r\nthe shores of the modern ones and see what is taking place there. One of\r\nthe most noticeable characters of a shore is the line of flotsam that is\r\nleft by the edge of the waves; here you may find all kinds of land plants\r\nmixed with the sea shells and general rubbish, plants that may have\r\ndrifted far. Much of the débris (outside towns) is brought down by the\r\nrivers, and may be carried some distance out to sea; then part becomes\r\nwaterlogged and sinks, and part floats in to shore, perhaps to be carried\r\nout again, or to be buried under the coarse sand of the beach. When we\r\nexamine sandstone rock, or the finer grained stones which are hardened\r\nmud, we find in them the remains of shells, sometimes of bones, and also\r\nof plant leaves and stems, which in their time had formed the flotsam of\r\na shore. Indeed, one may say that nearly every rock which has not been\r\nformed in ancient volcanoes, or been altered by their heat, carries in it\r\n_some_ trace of plant or animal. These remains are often very fragmentary\r\nand difficult to recognize, but sometimes they are wellnigh as perfect as\r\ndried specimens of living things. When they are recognizable as plant or\r\nanimal remains they are commonly called “fossils”, and it is from their\r\ntestimony that we must learn all we can know about the life of the past.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1.—The Face of a Quarry, showing layers or “beds”\r\n  of different rock, _a_, _b_, and _c_. The top gravel and soil _s_ has\r\n  been disintegrated by the growing plants and atmosphere.]\r\n\r\nIf we would find such stones for ourselves, the quarries offer the best\r\nhunting ground, for there several layers of rock are exposed, and we can\r\nreach fresh surfaces which have not been decayed by rain and storm. Fig.\r\n1 shows a diagram of a quarry, and illustrates the almost universal fact\r\nthat the beds of rock when undisturbed lie parallel to each other. Rock\r\n_a_ in the figure is fine-grained limestone, _b_ black friable shale\r\nmixed with sand, and _c_ purer shale. In such a series of rocks the best\r\nfossils will be found in the limestone; its harder and finer structure\r\nacting as a better preservative of organisms than the others. In\r\nlimestone one finds both plant and animal fossils, very often mixed\r\ntogether as the flotsam on the shore is mixed. Many limestones split\r\nalong parallel planes, and may break into quite thin sheets on whose\r\nsurfaces the flattened fossils show particularly well.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, with the plant fossils that we must concern ourselves,\r\nand among them we find great variety of form. Some are more or less\r\ncomplete, and give an immediate idea of the size and appearance of the\r\nplant to which they had belonged; but such are rare. One of the\r\nbest-known examples of this type is the base of a great tree trunk\r\nillustrated in the frontispiece. With such a fossil there is no shadow of\r\ndoubt that it is part of a giant tree, and its spreading roots running so\r\nfar horizontally along the ground suggest the picture of a large crown of\r\nbranches. Most fossils, however, are much less illuminating, and it is\r\nusually only by the careful piecing together of fragments that we can\r\nobtain a mental picture of a fossil plant.\r\n\r\nA fossil such as that illustrated in the frontispiece—and on a smaller\r\nscale this type of preservation is one of the commonest—does not actually\r\nconsist of the plant body itself. Although from the outside it looks as\r\nthough it were a stem base covered with bark, the whole of the inner\r\nportion is composed of fine hard rock with no trace of woody tissue. In\r\nsuch specimens we have the shape, size, and form of the plant preserved,\r\nbut none of its actual structure or cells. It is, in fact, a Cast. Fossil\r\ncasts appear to have been formed by fine sand or mud silting round a\r\nsubmerged stump and enclosing it as completely as if it had been set in\r\nplaster of Paris; then the wood and soft tissue decayed and the hollow\r\nwas filled up with more fine silt; gradually all the bark also decayed\r\nand the mud hardened into stone. Thus the stone mould round the outside\r\nof the plant enclosed a stone casting. When, after lying for ages\r\nundisturbed, these fossils are unearthed, they are so hard and “set” that\r\nthe surrounding stone peels away from the inner part, just as a plaster\r\ncast comes away from an object and retains its shape. There are many\r\nvarieties of casts among fossil plants. Sometimes on breaking a rock it\r\nwill split so as to show the perfect form of the surface of a stem, while\r\nits reverse is left on the stone as is shown in fig. 2. Had we only the\r\nreverse we should still have been able to see the form of the leaf bases\r\nby taking a wax impression from it; although there is nothing of the\r\nactual tissue of the plant in such a fossil. Sometimes casts of leaf\r\nbases show the detail preserved with wonderful sharpness, as in fig. 3.\r\nThis is an illustration of the leaf scars of _Lepidodendron_, which often\r\nform particularly good casts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2.—A, Cast of the Surface showing the Shape of Leaf\r\n  Bases of _Sigillaria_; B, the reverse of the impression left on the\r\n  adjacent layer of rock. (Photo.)]\r\n\r\nIn other instances the cast may simply represent the internal hollows of\r\nthe plant. This happens most commonly in the case of stems which\r\ncontained soft pith cells which quickly decayed, or with naturally hollow\r\nstems like the Horse-tails (_Equisetum_) of to-day. Fine mud or sand\r\nsilted into such hollows completely filling them up, and then, whether\r\nthe rest of the plant were preserved or not, the shape of the inside of\r\nthe stem remains as a solid stone. Where this has happened, and the outer\r\npart of the plant has decayed so as to leave no trace, the solid plug of\r\nstone from the centre may look very much like an actual stem itself, as\r\nit is cylindrical and may have surface markings like those on the\r\noutsides of stems. Some of the casts of this type were for long a puzzle\r\nto the older fossil botanists, particularly that illustrated in fig. 4,\r\nwhere the whole looks like a pile of discs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3.—Cast of the Leaf Bases of _Lepidodendron_,\r\n  showing finely marked detail. (Photo.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.—“_Sternbergia._” Internal cast of the stem of\r\n  _Cordaites_.]\r\n\r\nThe true nature of this fossil was recognized when casts of the plan were\r\nfound with some of the wood preserved outside the castings; and it was\r\nthen known that the plant had a hollow pith, with transverse bands of\r\ntissue across it at intervals which caused the curious constrictions in\r\nthe cast.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5.—Leaf Impressions of “Fern” _Sphenopteris_ on\r\n  Shale. (Photo.)]\r\n\r\nAnother form of cast which is common in some rocks is that of seeds. As a\r\nrule these casts are not connected with any actually preserved tissue,\r\nbut they show the external form, or the form of the stony part of the\r\nseed. Well-known seeds of this type are those of _Trigonocarpon_, which\r\nhas three characteristic ridges down the stone. Sometimes in the fine\r\nsandstone in which they occur embedded, the _internal_ cast lies embedded\r\n_in the external_ cast, and between them there is a slight space, now\r\nempty, but which once contained the actual shell of the seed, now\r\ndecayed. Thus we may rattle the “stone” of a fossil fruit as we do the\r\ndried nuts of to-day—the external resemblance between the living and the\r\nfossil is very striking, but of the actual tissues of the fossil seed\r\nnothing is left.\r\n\r\nCasts have been of great service to the fossil botanists, for they often\r\ngive clear indications of the external appearance of the parts they\r\nrepresent; particularly of stems, leaf scars, and large seeds. But all\r\nsuch fossils are very imperfect records of the past plants, for none of\r\nthe actual plant tissues, no minute anatomy or cell structure, is\r\npreserved in that way.\r\n\r\nA type of fossil which often shows more detail, and which usually retains\r\nsomething of the actual tissues of the plant, is that known technically\r\nas the Impression. These fossils are the most attractive of all the many\r\nkinds we have scattered through the rocks, for they often show with\r\nmarvellous perfection the most delicate and beautiful fern leaves, such\r\nas in fig. 5. Here the plant shows up as a black silhouette against the\r\ngrey stone, and the very veins of the midrib and leaves are quite\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nFig. 6 shows another fernlike leaf in an impression, not quite flat like\r\nthat shown in fig. 5, but with a slight natural curvature of the leaves\r\nsimilar to what would have been their form in life. Though an impression,\r\nthis specimen is not of the “pressed plant” type, it almost might be\r\ndescribed as a _bas-relief_.\r\n\r\nSometimes impressions of fern foliage are very large, and show highly\r\nbranched and complex leaves like those of tree ferns, and they may cover\r\nlarge sheets of stone. They are particularly common in the fine shales\r\nabove coal seams, and are best seen in the mines, for they are often too\r\nbig to bring to the surface complete.\r\n\r\nIn most impressions the black colour is due to a film of carbon which\r\nrepresents the partly decomposed tissues of the plant. Sometimes this\r\nfilm is cohesive enough to be detached from the stone without damage.\r\nBeautiful specimens of this kind are to be seen in the Royal Scottish\r\nMuseum, Edinburgh where the coiled bud of a young fern leaf has been\r\nseparated from the rock on which it was pressed, and mounted on glass.\r\nSuch specimens might be called mummy plants, for they are the actual\r\nplant material, but so decayed and withered that the internal cells are\r\nno longer intact. In really well preserved ones it is sometimes possible\r\nto peel off the plant film, and then treat it with strong chemical agents\r\nto clear the black carbon atoms away, and mount it for microscopic\r\nexamination, when the actual outline of the epidermis cells can be seen.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6.—Impression of _Neuropteris_ Leaf, showing\r\n  details of veins, the leaves in partial relief. (Photo.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 7.—Leaf Impression of _Ginkgo_, of which the film\r\n  was strong enough to peel off complete]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 7, the impression is that of a _Ginkgo_ leaf, and after treatment\r\nthe cells of the epidermis were perfectly recognizable under the\r\nmicroscope, with the stomates (breathing pores) also well preserved. This\r\nis shown in fig. 8, where the outline of the cells was drawn from the\r\nmicroscope. In such specimens, however, it is only the outer skin which\r\nis preserved, the inner soft tissue, the vital anatomy of the plant, is\r\ncrushed and carbonized.\r\n\r\nLeaves, stems, roots, even flowers (in the more recent rocks) and seeds\r\nmay all be preserved as impressions; and very often those from the more\r\nrecently formed rocks are so sharply defined and perfect that they seem\r\nto be actual dried leaves laid on the stone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8.—Outline of the Cells from Specimen of Leaf shown\r\n  in fig. 7\r\n\r\n  _c_, Ordinary cells; _s_, stomates; _v_, elongated cells above the\r\n  vein.]\r\n\r\nMuch evidence has been accumulated that goes to show that the rocks which\r\ncontain the best impressions were originally deposited under tranquil\r\nconditions in water. It might have been in a pool or quiet lake with\r\novershadowing trees, or a landlocked inlet of the sea where silt quietly\r\naccumulated, and as the plant fragments fell or drifted into the spot\r\nthey were covered by fine-grained mud without disturbance. In the case of\r\nthose which are very well preserved this must have taken place with\r\nconsiderable rapidity, so that they were shut away from contact with the\r\nair and from the decay which it induces.\r\n\r\nImpressions in the thin sheets of fine rock may be compared to dried\r\nspecimens pressed between sheets of blotting paper; they are flattened,\r\npreserved from decay, and their detailed outline is retained. Fossils of\r\nthis kind are most valuable, for they give a clear picture of the form of\r\nthe foliage, and when, as sometimes happens, large masses of leaves, or\r\nbranches with several leaves attached to them, are preserved together, it\r\nis possible to reconstruct the plant from them. It is chiefly from such\r\nimpressions that the inspiration is drawn for those semi-imaginary\r\npictures of the forests of long ago. From them also are drawn many facts\r\nof prime importance to scientists about the nature and appearance of\r\nplants, of which the internal anatomy is known from other specimens, and\r\nalso about the connection of various parts with each other.\r\n\r\nSometimes isolated impressions are found in clay balls or nodules. When\r\nthe latter are split open they may show as a centre or nucleus a leaf or\r\ncone, round which the nodule has collected. In such cases the plant is\r\noften preserved without compression, and may show something of the minute\r\ndetails of organization. The preservation, however, is generally far from\r\nperfect when viewed from a microscopical standpoint. Fig. 9 shows one of\r\nthese smooth, clayey nodules split open, and within it the cone which\r\nformed its centre, also split into two, and standing in high relief, with\r\nits scales showing clearly. Similar nodules or balls of clay are found\r\nto-day, forming in slowly running water, and it may be generally observed\r\nthat they collect round some rubbish, shell, or plant fragment. These\r\nnodules are particularly well seen nowadays in the mouth of the Clyde,\r\nwhere they are formed with great rapidity.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 9.—Clay Nodule split open, showing the two halves\r\n  of the cone which was its centre. (Photo.)]\r\n\r\nAnother kind of preservation is that which coats over the whole plant\r\nsurface with mineral matter, which hardens, and thus preserves the _form_\r\nof the plant. This process can be observed going on to-day in the\r\nneighbourhood of hot volcanic streams where the water is heavily charged\r\nwith minerals. In most cases such fossils have proved of little\r\nimportance to science, though there are some interesting specimens in the\r\nFrench museums which have not yet been fully examined. A noteworthy\r\nfossil of this type is the _Chara_, which, growing in masses together,\r\nhas sometimes been preserved in this way in large quantities, indicating\r\nthe existence of an ancient pond in the locality.\r\n\r\nThere is quite a variety of other types of preservation among fossil\r\nplants, but they are of minor interest and importance, and hardly justify\r\ndetailed consideration. One example that should be mentioned is Amber.\r\nThis is the gum of old resinous trees, and is a well-known substance\r\nwhich may rank as a “fossil”. Jet, too, is formed from plants, while coal\r\nis so important that the whole of the next chapter will be devoted to its\r\nconsideration. Even the black lead of pencils possibly represents plants\r\nthat were once alive on this globe.\r\n\r\nThough such remains tell us of the existence of plants at the place they\r\nwere found at a known period in the past, yet they tell very little about\r\nthe actual structure of the plants themselves, and therefore very little\r\nthat is of real use to the botanist. Fortunately, however, there are\r\nfossils which preserve every cell of the plant tissues, each one perfect,\r\ndistended as in life, and yet replaced by stone so as to be hard and to\r\nallow of the preparation of thin sections which can be studied with the\r\nmicroscope. These are the vegetable fossils which are of prime importance\r\nto the botanist and the scientific enquirer into the evolution of plants.\r\nSuch specimens are commonly known as Petrifactions.\r\n\r\nSometimes small isolated stumps of wood or branches have been completely\r\npermeated by silica, which replaces the cell walls and completely\r\npreserves and hardens the tissues. This silicified wood is found in a\r\nnumber of different beds of rock, and may be seen washed out on the shore\r\nin Yorkshire, Sutherland, and other places where such rocks occur. When\r\nsuch a block is cut and polished the annual rings and all the fine\r\nstructure or “grain” of the wood become as apparent as in recent wood.\r\nFrom these fossils, too, microscopic sections can be cut, and then the\r\nindividual wood cells can be studied almost as well as those of living\r\ntrees. A particularly notable example of fossil tree trunks is the\r\nTertiary forest of the Yellowstone Park. Here the petrified trunks are\r\nweathered out and stand together much as they must have stood when alive;\r\nthey are of course bereft of their foliage branches.\r\n\r\nSuch specimens, however, are usually only isolated blocks of wood, often\r\nfragments from large stumps which show nothing but the rings of\r\nlate-formed wood. It is impossible to connect them with the impressions\r\nof leaves or fruits in most cases, so that of the plants they represent\r\nwe know only the anatomical structure of the secondary wood and nothing\r\nof the foliage or general appearance of the plant as a whole. Hence these\r\nspecimens also give a very partial representation of the plants to which\r\nthey belonged.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, there is still another type of preservation of\r\nfossils, a type more perfect than any of the others and sometimes\r\ncombining the advantages of all of them. This is the special type of\r\npetrifaction which includes, not a single piece of wood, but a whole mass\r\nof vegetation consisting of fragments of stems, roots, leaves, and even\r\nseeds, sometimes all together. These petrifactions are those of masses of\r\nforest débris which were lying as they dropped from the trees, or had\r\ndrifted together as such fragments do. The plant tissues in such masses\r\nare preserved so that the most delicate soft tissue cells are perfect,\r\nand in many cases the sections are so distinct that one might well be\r\ndeluded into the belief that it is a living plant at which one looks.\r\n\r\nVery important and well-known specimens have been found in France and\r\ndescribed by the French palæobotanists. As a rule these specimens are\r\npreserved in silica, and are found now in irregular masses of the nature\r\nof chert. Of still greater importance, however, owing partly to their\r\ngreater abundance and partly to the quantity of scientific work that has\r\nbeen done on them, are the masses of stone found in the English coal\r\nseams and commonly called “coal balls”.\r\n\r\nThe “coal balls” are best known from Lancashire and Yorkshire, where they\r\nare extremely common in some of the mines, but they also occur in\r\nWestphalia and other places on the Continent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10.—Mass of Coal with many “coal balls” embedded in\r\n  it\r\n\r\n  _a a_, In surface view; _b b_, cut across. All washed with acid to make\r\n  the coal balls show up against the black coal. (Photo by Lomax.)]\r\n\r\nIn external appearance the “coal balls” are slightly irregular roundish\r\nmasses, most generally about the size of potatoes, and black on the\r\noutside from films of adhering coal. Their size varies greatly, and they\r\nhave been found from that of peas up to masses with a diameter of a foot\r\nand a half. They lie embedded in the coal and are not very easily\r\nrecognizable in it at first, because they are black also, but when washed\r\nwith acid they turn greyish-white and then can be recognized clearly.\r\nFig. 10 shows a block of coal with an exceptionally large number of the\r\n“coal balls” embedded in it. This figure illustrates their slightly\r\nirregular rounded form in a typical manner. By chemical analysis they are\r\nfound to consist of a nearly pure mixture of the carbonates of lime and\r\nmagnesia; though in some specimens there is a considerable quantity of\r\niron sulphide, and in all there is at least 5 per cent of various\r\nimpurities and some quantity of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe important mineral compounds, CaCO_3 and MgCO_3, are mixed in very\r\ndifferent quantities, and even in coal balls lying quite close to each\r\nother there is often much dissimilarity in this respect. In whatever\r\nproportion these minerals are combined, it seems to make but little\r\ndifference to their preservative power, and in good “coal balls” they may\r\ncompletely replace and petrify each individual cell of the plants in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 11.—Photograph of Section across Stem of\r\n  _Sphenophyllum_ from a Lancashire “coal ball”, showing perfect\r\n  preservation of woody tissue\r\n\r\n  W, wood; _c_, cortex.]\r\n\r\nFig. 11 shows a section across the wood of a stem preserved in a “coal\r\nball”, and illustrates a degree of perfection which is not uncommon. In\r\nthe course of the succeeding chapters constant reference will be made to\r\ntissues preserved in “coal balls”, and it may be noticed that not only\r\nthe relatively hard woody cells are preserved but the very softest and\r\nyoungest tissues also appear equally unharmed by their long sojourn in\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 12.—Photograph of Section through a Bud of\r\n  _Lepidodendron_, showing many small leaves tightly packed round the\r\n  axis. From a “coal ball”]\r\n\r\nThe particular value of the coal balls as records of past vegetation lies\r\nin the fact that they are petrifactions, not of individual plants alone,\r\nbut of masses of plant débris. Hence in one of these stony concretions\r\nmay lie twigs with leaves attached, bits of stems with their fruits, and\r\nfine rootlets growing through the mass. A careful study and comparison of\r\nthese fragments has led to the connection, piece by piece, of the various\r\nparts of many plants. Such a specimen as that figured in fig. 12 shows\r\nhow the soft tissues of young leaves are preserved, and how their\r\nrelation to each other and to the axis is indicated.\r\n\r\nHitherto the only concretions of the nature of “coal balls” containing\r\nwell preserved plant débris, have been found in the coal or immediately\r\nabove it, and are of Palæozoic age (see p. 34). Recent exploration,\r\nhowever, has resulted in the discovery of similar concretions of Mesozoic\r\nage, from which much may be hoped in the future. Still, at present, it is\r\nto the palæozoic specimens we must turn for nearly all valuable knowledge\r\nabout ancient plants, and primarily to that form of preservation of the\r\nspecimens known as structural petrifactions, of which the “coal balls”\r\nare both the commonest and the most perfect examples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n               COAL, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF PLANT REMAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the many forms which are taken by fossil plants were shortly\r\ndescribed in the last chapter, but the most important of all, namely\r\ncoal, must now be considered. Of the fossils hitherto mentioned many are\r\ndifficult to recognize without examining them very closely, and one might\r\nsay that all have but little influence on human life, for they are of\r\nlittle practical or commercial use, and their scientific value is not yet\r\nvery widely known. Of all fossil plants, the great exception is coal. Its\r\ncommercial importance all over the world needs no illustration, and its\r\nappearance needs no description for it is in use in nearly every\r\nhousehold. Quite apart from its economic importance, coal has a unique\r\nplace among fossils in the eyes of the scientist, and is of special\r\ninterest to the palæontologist.\r\n\r\nIn England nearly all the coal lies in rocks of a great age, belonging to\r\na period very remote in the world’s history. The rocks bearing the coal\r\ncontain other fossils, principally those of marine animals, which are\r\ncharacteristic of them and of the period during which they were formed,\r\nwhich is generally known as the “Coal Measure period”. There is\r\ngeological proof that at one time the coal seams were much more widely\r\nspread over England than they are at present; they have been broken up\r\nand destroyed in the course of ages, by the natural movements among the\r\nrocks and by the many changes and processes of disintegration and decay\r\nwhich have gone on ever since they were deposited. To-day there are but\r\nrelatively small coal-bearing areas, which have been preserved in the\r\nhollows of the synclines.[2]\r\n\r\nThe seams of coal are extremely numerous, and even the same seam may vary\r\ngreatly in thickness. From a quarter of an inch to five or six feet is\r\nthe commonest thickness for coal in this country, but there are many beds\r\nabroad of very much greater size. Thin seams often lie irregularly in\r\ncoarse sandstone; for example, they may be commonly seen in the Millstone\r\nGrit; but typical coal seams are found embedded between rocks of a more\r\nor less definite character known as the “roof” and “floor”.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 13.—Diagram of a Series of Parallel Coal Seams with\r\n  Underclays and Shale Roofs of varying thicknesses]\r\n\r\nBasalts, granites, and such rocks do not contain coal; the coal measures\r\nin which the seams of coal occur are, generally speaking, limestones,\r\nfine sandstones, and shales, that is to say, rocks which in their origin\r\nwere deposited under water. In detail almost every seam has some\r\nindividual peculiarity, but the following represents two types of typical\r\nseams. In many cases, below the coal, the limestone or sandstone rocks\r\ngive place to fine, yellow-coloured layers of clay, which varies from a\r\nfew inches to many feet in thickness and is called the “underclay”. This\r\nfine clay is generally free from pebbles and coarse débris of all kinds,\r\nand is often supposed to be the soil in which the plants forming the coal\r\nhad been growing. The line of demarcation between the coal and the clay\r\nis usually very sharp, and the compact black layers of hard coal stop\r\nalmost as abruptly on the upper side and give place to a shale or\r\nlimestone “roof”; see fig. 13, layers 5, 6, and 7. Very frequently a\r\nnumber of small seams come together, lying parallel, and sometimes\r\nsucceeding each other so rapidly that the “roof” is eliminated, and a\r\nclay floor followed by a coal seam, is succeeded immediately by another\r\nclay floor and another coal seam, as in fig. 13, layers 10, 11, and 12.\r\nThe relative thickness of these beds also varies very greatly, and over\r\nan underclay of seven or eight feet the coal seam may only reach a couple\r\nof inches, while a thick seam may have a floor of very slight dimensions.\r\nThese relations depend on such a variety of local circumstances from the\r\nday they were forming, that it is only possible to unravel the causes\r\nwhen an individual case is closely studied. The main sequence, however,\r\nis constant and is that illustrated in fig. 13.\r\n\r\nThe second type of seam is that in which the underclay floor is not\r\npresent, and is replaced either by shales or by a special very hard rock\r\nof a finely granular nature called “gannister”. In the gannister floor it\r\nis usual to find traces of rootlets and basal stumps of plants, which\r\nseem to indicate that the gannister was the ground in which the plants\r\nforming the coal were rooted. The coal itself is generally very pure\r\nplant remains, though between its layers are often found bands of shaly\r\nstone which are called “dirt bands”. These are particularly noticeable in\r\nthick seams, and they may be looked on as corresponding to the roof\r\nshales; as though, in fact, the roof had started to form but had only\r\nreached a slight development when the coal formation began again.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 14.—Diagram of Coal Seam with Gannister Floor, in\r\n  which are traces of rootlets _r_, and of stumps of root-like organs _s_]\r\n\r\nThat the coal is strikingly different from the rocks in which it lies is\r\nvery obvious, but that alone is no indication of its origin. It is now so\r\nuniversally known and accepted that coal is the remains of vegetables\r\nthat no proofs are usually offered for the statement. It is, however, of\r\nboth interest and importance to marshal the evidence for this belief. The\r\ngrounds for recognizing coal as consisting of practically pure plant\r\nremains are many and various, so that only the more important of them\r\nwill be considered now. The most direct suggestion lies in the\r\nimpressions of leaves and stems which are found between its layers; this,\r\nhowever, is confronted by the parallel case of plant impressions found in\r\nshales and limestones which are not of vegetable origin, so that it might\r\nbe argued that those plants in the coal drifted in as did those in the\r\nlimestone. But when we examine the black impressions on limestone or\r\nsandstone, an item of value is noticeable; it is often possible to peel\r\noff a film, lying between the upper and lower impression, of black coaly\r\nsubstance, sometimes an eighth of an inch thick, and hard and shining\r\nlike coal. This follows the outline of the plant form of the impression,\r\nand it is certain that this minute “coal seam” was formed from the plant\r\ntissues. It is, in fact, a coal seam bearing the clearest possible\r\nevidence of its plant nature. We have only to imagine this multiplied by\r\nmany plants lying tightly packed together, with no mineral impurities\r\nbetween, to see that it would yield a coal seam like those we find\r\nactually existing.\r\n\r\nIn some cases in the coal itself a certain amount of the structure of the\r\nplants which formed it remains, though usually, in the process of their\r\ndecay the tissues have entirely decomposed, and left only their\r\ncarbonized elements. Chemical analysis reveals that, beyond the\r\npercentage of mineral ash which is found in living plants, there is\r\nlittle in a pure sample of coal that is not carbonaceous. All the\r\ndeposits of carbon found in any form in nature can be traced to some\r\nanimal or vegetable remains, so that it is logical to assume that coal\r\nalso arose from either animal or plant débris. But were coal of an animal\r\norigin, the amount of mineral matter in it would be much larger as well\r\nas being of a different nature; for almost all animals have skeletons,\r\neven the simplest single-celled protozoa often own calcareous shells,\r\nsponges have siliceous spicules, molluscs hard shells, and the higher\r\nanimals bones and teeth. These things are of a very permanent nature, and\r\nwould certainly be found in quantities in the coal had animals formed it.\r\nFurther, the peat of to-day, which collects in thick compact masses of\r\nvegetable, shows how plants may form a material consisting of carbonized\r\nremains. By certain experiments in which peat was subjected to pressure\r\nand heat, practically normal coal was made from it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15.—Part of a Coal Ball, showing the concentric\r\n  bandings in it which are characteristic of concretions]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 16.—Mass of Coal with Coal Balls, A and B both\r\n  enclosing part of the same stem L]\r\n\r\nStill a further witness may be found in the structure of the “coal balls”\r\ndescribed in the last chapter. These stony masses, lying in the pure\r\ncoal, might well be considered as apart from it and bearing no relation\r\nto its structure; but recent work has shown that they were actually\r\nformed at the same time as the coal, developing in its mass as mineral\r\nconcretions round some of the plants in the soft, saturated, peaty mass\r\nwhich was to be hardened into coal later on.[3] All “coal balls” do not\r\nshow their concretionary structure so clearly, but sometimes it can be\r\nseen that they are made with concentric bands or markings like those\r\ncharacteristic of ordinary mineral concretions (see fig. 15). Concretions\r\nare formed by the crystallization of minerals round some centre, and it\r\nmust have happened that in the coal seams in which the coal-ball\r\nconcretions are found that this process took place in the soft plant mass\r\nbefore it hardened. Recent research has found that there is good evidence\r\nthat those seams[4] resulted from the slow accumulation of plant débris\r\nunder the salt or brackish water in whose swamps the plants were growing,\r\nand that as they were collecting the ground slowly sank till they were\r\nquite below the level of the sea and were covered by marine silt. At the\r\nsame time some of the minerals present in the sea water, which must have\r\nsaturated the mass, crystallized partly and deposited themselves round\r\ncentres in the plant tissues, and by enclosing them and penetrating them\r\npreserved them from decay till the mineral structure entirely replaced\r\nthe cells, molecule by molecule. Evidence is not wanting that this\r\nprocess went on without disturbance, for in fig. 16 is shown a mass of\r\ncoal in which lie several coal balls, two of which enclose parts of the\r\nsame plant. This means that round different centres in the same stem two\r\nof the concretions were forming and preserving the tissues; the two stone\r\nmasses, however, did not enlarge enough to unite, but left a part of the\r\ntissue unmineralized, which is now seen as a streak of coal. We have here\r\nthe most important proof that the coal balls are actually formed in the\r\ncoal and of the plants making the coal, for had those coal balls come in\r\nas pebbles, or in any way from the outside into the coal, they could not\r\nhave remained in such a position as to lie side by side enclosing part of\r\nthe same stem. There are many other details which may be used in this\r\nproof, but this one illustration serves to show the importance of coal\r\nballs when dealing with the theories of the origin of coal, for they are\r\nperfectly preserved samples of what the whole coal mass was at one time.\r\n\r\nThere are but few seams, however, which contain coal balls, and about\r\nthose in which they do not occur our knowledge is very scanty. It is\r\noften assumed that the plant impressions in the shales above the coal\r\nseams can be taken as fair samples of those which formed the coal itself;\r\nbut this has been recently shown to be a fallacious argument in some\r\ncases, so that it is impossible to rely on it in general. The truth is,\r\nthat though coal is one of the most studied of all the geological\r\ndeposits, we are still profoundly ignorant of the details of its\r\nformation except in a few cases.\r\n\r\nThe way in which coal seams were formed has been described often and\r\nvariously, and for many years there were heated discussions between the\r\nupholders of the different views as to the merits of their various\r\ntheories. It is now certain that there must have been at least four\r\nprincipal ways in which coal was formed, and the different seams are\r\nillustrations of the products of different methods. In all cases more or\r\nless water is required, for coal is what is known as a sedimentary\r\ndeposit, that is, one which collects under water, like the fine mud and\r\nsilt and débris in a lake. It will be understood, however, that if the\r\nplant remains were collecting at any spot, and the water brought in sand\r\nand mud as well, then the deposit could not have resulted in pure coal,\r\nbut would have been a sandy mixture with many plant remains, and would\r\nhave resulted in the formation of a rock, such as parts of the millstone\r\ngrit, where there are many streaks of coal through the stone.\r\n\r\nAmong various coal seams, evidence for the following modes of coal\r\nformation can be found:—\r\n\r\n(_a_) _In fresh water._—In still freshwater lakes or pools, with\r\noverhanging plants growing on the banks, twigs and leaves which fell or\r\nwere blown into the water became waterlogged and sank to the bottom. With\r\na luxuriant growth of plants rapidly collecting under water, and there\r\npreserved from contact with the air and its decaying influence, enough\r\nplant remains would collect to form a seam. After that some change in the\r\nlocal conditions took place, and other deposits covered the plants and\r\nbegan the accumulations which finally pressed the vegetable mass into\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nTo freshwater lakes of large size plants might also have been brought by\r\nrivers and streams; they would have become waterlogged in time, after\r\nfloating farther than the sand and stones with which they came, and would\r\nthus settle and form a deposit practically free from anything but plant\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _As peat._—Peat commonly forms on our heather moors and bogs to-day\r\nto a considerable thickness. This also took place long ago in all\r\nprobability, and when the level of the land altered it would have been\r\ncovered by other deposits, pressed, and finally changed into coal.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _In salt or brackish water, growing in situ._—Trees and undergrowth\r\ngrowing thickly together in a salt or brackish marsh supplied a large\r\nquantity of débris which fell into the mud or water below them, and were\r\nthus shut off from the air and partly preserved. When conditions favoured\r\nthe formation of a coal seam the land level was slowly sinking, and so,\r\nthough the débris collected in large quantities, it was always kept just\r\nbeneath the water level. Finally the land sank more rapidly, till the\r\nvegetable mass was quite under sea water, then mud was deposited over it,\r\nand the materials which were afterwards hardened to form the roof rocks\r\nwere deposited. This was the case in those seams in which “coal balls”\r\noccur, and the evidence of the sea water covering the coal soon after it\r\nwas deposited lies in the numerous sea shells found in the roof\r\nimmediately above it.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _In salt water, drifted material._—Tree trunks and large tangled\r\nmasses of vegetation drifted out to sea by the rivers just as they do\r\nto-day. These became waterlogged, and finally sank some distance from the\r\nshore. (Those sinking near the shore would not form pure coal, for sand\r\nand mud would be mixed with them, also brought down by rivers and stirred\r\nup from the bottom by waves.) The currents would bring numbers of such\r\nplants to the same area until a large mass was deposited on the sea\r\nfloor. Finally the local conditions would have changed, the currents then\r\nbringing mud or sand, which covered the vegetable mass and formed the\r\nmineral roof of the resulting coal seam. There is a variety of what might\r\nbe called the “drifted coals”, which appears to have been formed of\r\nnothing but the _spores_ of plants of a resinous nature. These structures\r\nmust have been very light, and possibly floated a long distance before\r\nsinking.\r\n\r\nIf we could but obtain enough evidence to understand each case fully we\r\nshould probably find that every coal seam represents some slightly\r\ndifferent mode of formation, that in each case there was some local\r\npeculiarity in the plants themselves and the way they accumulated in\r\ncoal-forming masses, but the above four methods will be found to cover\r\nthe principal ways in which coal has arisen.\r\n\r\nCoal, as we now know it, has a great variety of qualities. The\r\ndifferences probably depend only to a small extent on the varieties among\r\nthe plants forming it, and are almost entirely due to the many later\r\nconditions which have affected the coal after its original formation.\r\nSome such conditions are the various upheavals and depressions to which\r\nthe rocks containing the coal have been subjected, the weight of the beds\r\nlying over the coal seams, and the high temperatures to which they may\r\nhave been subjected when lying under a considerable depth of\r\nlater-deposited rocks. The influence on the coal of these and many other\r\nphysical factors has been enormous, but they are purely cosmical and\r\nbelong to the special realm of geological study, and so cannot be\r\nconsidered in detail now.\r\n\r\nTo return to our special subject, namely, the plants themselves which are\r\nnow preserved in the coal. Their nature and appearance, their affinities\r\nand minute structure, can only be ascertained by a detailed study, to\r\nwhich the following chapters will be devoted, though in their limited\r\nspace but an outline sketch of the subject can be drawn.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated by some writers that in the Coal Measure period plants\r\nwere more numerous and luxuriant than they ever were before or ever have\r\nbeen since. This view could only have been brought forward by one who was\r\nconsidering the geology of England alone, and in any case there appears\r\nto be very little real evidence for such a view. Certainly in Europe a\r\nlarge proportion of the coal is of this age, and to supply the enormous\r\nmasses of vegetation it represents a great growth of plants must have\r\nexisted. But it is evident that just at the Carboniferous period in what\r\nis now called Europe the physical conditions of the land which roughly\r\ncorresponded to the present Continent were such as favoured the\r\naccumulation of plants, and the gradual sinking of the land level also\r\nfavoured their preservation under rapidly succeeding deposits. Of the\r\ncountless plants growing in Europe to-day very few stand any chance of\r\nbeing preserved as coal for the future; so that, unless the physical\r\nconditions were suitable, plants might have been growing in great\r\nquantity at any given period without ever forming coal. But now that the\r\ngeology of the whole world is becoming better known, it is found that\r\ncoal is by no means specially confined to the Coal Measure age. Even in\r\nEurope coals of a much later date are worked, while abroad, especially in\r\nAsia and Australia, the later coals are very important. For example, in\r\nJapan, seams of coal 14, 20, and even more feet in thickness are worked\r\nwhich belong to the Tertiary period (see p. 34), while in Manchuria coal\r\n100 feet thick is reported of the same age. When these facts are\r\nconsidered it is soon found that all the statements made about the unique\r\nvegetative luxuriance of the Coal Measure period are founded either on\r\ninsufficient evidence or on no evidence at all.\r\n\r\nThe plants forming the later coals must have had in their own structure\r\nmuch that differed from those forming the old coals of Britain, and the\r\ngradual change in the character of the vegetation in the course of the\r\nsucceeding ages is a point of first-rate importance and interest which\r\nwill be considered shortly in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                      THE SEVEN AGES OF PLANT LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nLife has played its important part on the earth for countless series of\r\nyears, of the length of whose periods no one has any exact knowledge.\r\nMany guesses have been made, and many scientific theories have been used\r\nto estimate their duration, but they remain inscrutable. When numbers are\r\nimmense they cease to hold any meaning for us, for the human mind cannot\r\ncomprehend the significance of vast numbers, of immense space, or of æons\r\nof time. Hence when we look back on the history of the world we cannot\r\nattempt to give even approximate dates for its events, and the best we\r\ncan do is to speak only of great periods as units whose relative position\r\nand whose relative duration we can estimate to some extent.\r\n\r\nThose who have studied geology, which is the science of the world’s\r\nhistory since its beginning, have given names to the great epochs and to\r\ntheir chief subdivisions. With the smaller periods and the subdivisions\r\nof the greater ones we will not concern ourselves, for our study of the\r\nplants it will suffice if we recognize the main sequence of past time.\r\n\r\nThe main divisions are practically universal, and evidence of their\r\nexistence and of the character of the creatures living in them can be\r\nfound all over the world; the smaller divisions, however, may often be\r\nlocal, or only of value in one continent. To the specialist even the\r\nsmallest of them is of importance, and is a link in the chain of evidence\r\nwith which he cannot dispense; but we are at present concerned only with\r\nthe broad outlines of the history of the plants of these periods, so will\r\nnot trouble ourselves with unnecessary details.[5] Corresponding to\r\ncertain marked changes in the character of the vegetation, we find seven\r\nimportant divisions of geological time which we will take as our unit\r\nperiods, and which are tabulated as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Cainozoic\r\n        I. Present Day.\r\n        II. Tertiary.\r\n  Mesozoic\r\n        III. Upper Cretaceous (or Chalk).\r\n        IV. The rest of the Mesozoic.\r\n        V. Newer Palæozoic, including\r\n              Permian.\r\n              Carboniferous.\r\n              Devonian.\r\n  Palæozoic\r\n        VI. Older Palæozoic.\r\n  Eozoic\r\n        VII. Archæan.\r\n\r\nNow the actual length of these various periods was very different. The\r\nepoch of the Present Day is only in its commencement, and is like a thin\r\nline if compared with the broad bands of the past epochs. By far the\r\ngreatest of the periods is the Archæan, and even the Older Palæozoic is\r\nprobably longer than all the others taken together. It is, however, so\r\nremote, and the rocks which were formed in it retain so little plant\r\nstructure that is decipherable, so few specimens which are more than mere\r\nfragments, that we know very little about it from the point of view of\r\nthe plant life of the time. It includes the immense indefinite epochs\r\nwhen plants began to evolve, and the later ones when animals of many\r\nkinds flourished, and when plants, too, were of great size and\r\nimportance, though we are ignorant of their structure. Of all the seven\r\ndivisions of time, we can say least about the two earliest, simply for\r\nwant of anything to say which is founded on fact rather than on\r\ntheoretical conclusions.\r\n\r\nAlthough these periods seem clearly marked off from one another when\r\nlooked at from a great distance, they are, of course, but arbitrary\r\ndivisions of one long, continuous series of slow changes. It is not in\r\nthe way of nature to make an abrupt change and suddenly shut off one\r\nperiod—be it a day or an æon—from another, and just as the seasons glide\r\nalmost imperceptibly into one another, so did the great periods of the\r\npast. Thus, though there is a strong and very evident contrast between\r\nthe plants typical of the Carboniferous period and of the Mesozoic, those\r\nof the Permian are to some extent intermediate, and between the beginning\r\nof the Permian and the end of the Carboniferous—if judged by the flora—it\r\nis often hard to decide.\r\n\r\nIt must be realized that almost any given spot of land—the north of\r\nEngland, for example—has been beneath the sea, and again elevated into\r\nthe air, at least more than once. That the hard rocks which make its\r\npresent-day hills have been built up from the silt and débris under an\r\nocean, and after being formed have seen daylight on a land surface long\r\nago, and sunk again to be covered by newer deposits, perhaps even a\r\nsecond or a third time, before they rose for the time that is the\r\npresent. Yet all these profound changes took place so slowly that had we\r\nbeen living then we could have felt no motion, just as we feel no motion\r\nto-day, though the land is continuing to change all around us. The great\r\nalternations between land and water over large areas mark out to some\r\nextent the main periods tabulated on p. 34, for after each great\r\nsubmersion the rising land seems to have harboured plants and animals\r\nwith somewhat different characters from those which inhabited it before.\r\nSimilarly, when the next submersion laid down more rocks of limestone and\r\nsandstone, they enclosed the shells of some creatures different from\r\nthose which had inhabited the seas of the region previously.\r\n\r\nThrough all the periods the actual rocks formed are very similar—shales,\r\nlimestones, sandstones, clays. When any rocks happen to have preserved\r\nneither plant nor animal remains it is almost impossible to tell to which\r\nepoch they belong, except from a comparative study of their position as\r\nregards other rocks which do retain fossils. This depends on the fact\r\nthat the physical processes of rock building have gone on throughout the\r\nhistory of the globe on very much the same lines as they are following at\r\npresent. By the sifting power of water, fine mud, sand, pebbles, and\r\nother débris are separated from each other and collected in masses like\r\nto like. The fine mud will harden into shales, sandgrains massed together\r\nharden into sandstones, and so on, and when, after being raised once more\r\nto form dry land, they are broken up by wind and rain and brought down\r\nagain to the sea, they settle out once again in a similar way and form\r\nnew shales and sandstones; and so on indefinitely. But meantime the\r\nliving things, both plant and animal, have been changing, growing,\r\nevolving, and the leafy twig brought down with the sandgrains in the\r\nflooded river of one epoch differs from that brought down by the river of\r\na succeeding epoch—though it might chance that the sandgrains were the\r\nsame identical ones. And hence it is by the remains of the plants and\r\nanimals in a rock that we can tell to which epoch it belonged. Unless, of\r\ncourse, ready-formed fossils from an earlier epoch get mixed with it,\r\ncoming as pebbles in the river in flood—but that is a subtle point of\r\ngeological importance which we cannot consider here. Such cases are\r\nalmost always recognizable, and do not affect the main proposition.\r\n\r\nFrom the various epochs, the plants which have been preserved as fossils\r\nare in nearly all cases those which had lived on the land, or at least on\r\nswamps and marshes by the land. Of water plants in the wide sense,\r\nincluding both those growing in fresh water and those in the sea, we have\r\ncomparatively few. This lack is particularly remarkable in the case of\r\nthe seaweeds, because they were actually growing in the very medium in\r\nwhich the bulk of the rocks were formed, and which we know from recent\r\nexperiments acts as a preservative for the tissues of land plants\r\nsubmerged in it. It must be remembered, however, that almost all the\r\nplants growing in water have very soft tissues, and are usually of small\r\nsize and delicate structure as compared with land plants, and thus would\r\nstand less chance of being preserved, and would also stand less chance of\r\nbeing recognized to-day were they preserved. The mark on a stone of the\r\nimpression of a soft film of a waterweed would be very slight as compared\r\nwith that left by a leathery leaf or the woody twig of a land plant.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, exceptions, and, as will be noted later on (see\r\nChapter XVII), there are fossil seaweeds and fossil freshwater plants,\r\nbut we may take it on the whole that the fossils we shall have to deal\r\nwith and that give important evidence, are those of the land which had\r\ndrifted out to sea, in the many cases when they are found in rocks\r\ntogether with sea shells.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider very shortly the salient features of the seven epochs\r\nwe have named as the chief divisions of time. The vegetation of the\r\nCarboniferous Period is better known to us than that of any other period\r\nexcept that of the present day, so that it will form the best\r\nstarting-point for our consideration.\r\n\r\nAt this period there were, as there are to-day, oceans and continents,\r\nhigh lands, low lands, rivers and lakes, in fact, all the physical\r\nfeatures of the present-day world, but they were all in different places\r\nfrom those of to-day. If we confine our attention to Britain, we find\r\nthat at that period the far north, Scotland, Wales, and Charnwood were\r\nhigher land, but the bulk of the southern area was covered by flat swamps\r\nor shallow inlets, where the land level gradually changed, slowly sinking\r\nin one place and slowly rising in others, which later began also to sink.\r\nGrowing on this area wherever they could get a foothold were many plants,\r\nall different from any now living. Among them none bore flowers. A few\r\nfamilies bore seeds in a peculiar way, differing widely from most\r\nseed-bearing plants of to-day. The most prevalent type of tree was that\r\nof which a stump is represented in the frontispiece, and of which there\r\nwere many different species. These plants, though in size and some other\r\nways similar to the great trees of to-day, were fundamentally different\r\nfrom them, and belonged to a very primitive family, of which but few and\r\nsmall representatives now exist, namely the Lycopods. Many other great\r\ntrees were like hugely magnified “horsetails” or Equisetums; and there\r\nwere also seed-bearing Gymnosperms of a type now extinct. There were\r\nferns of many kinds, of which the principal ones belong to quite extinct\r\nfamilies, as well as several other plants which have no parallel among\r\nliving ones. Hence one may judge that the vegetation was rich and\r\nvarious, and that, as there were tall trees with seeds, the plants were\r\nalready very highly evolved. Indeed, except for the highest group of all,\r\nthe flowering plants, practically all the main groups now known were\r\nrepresented. The flora of the Devonian was very similar in essentials.\r\n\r\nIf that be so, it may seem unsatisfactory to place all the preceding æons\r\nunder one heading, the Older Palæozoic. And, indeed, it is very\r\nunsatisfactory to be forced to do so. We know from the study of animal\r\nfossils that this time was vast, and that there were several well-defined\r\nperiods in it during which many groups of animals evolved, and became\r\nextinct after reaching their highest development; but of the plants we\r\nknow so little that we cannot make any divisions of time which would be\r\nof real value in helping us to understand them.\r\n\r\nFossil plants from the Early Palæozoic there are, but extremely few as\r\ncompared with the succeeding period, and those few but little\r\nilluminative. In the later divisions of the Pre-Carboniferous some of the\r\nplants seem to belong to the same genera as those of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod. There is a fern which is characteristic of one of the earlier\r\ndivisions, and there are several rather indefinite impressions which may\r\nbe considered as seaweeds. There is evidence also that even one of the\r\nhigher groups bearing seeds (the _Cordaiteæ_) was in full swing long\r\nbefore the Carboniferous period began. Hence, though of Older Palæozoic\r\nplants we know little of actual fact, we can surmise the salient truths;\r\nviz., that in that period those plants must have been evolving which were\r\nimportant in the Devonian and Carboniferous periods; that in the earlier\r\npart of that period they did not exist, and the simpler types only\r\nclothed the earth; and that further back still, even the simpler types\r\nhad not yet evolved.\r\n\r\nNames have been given to many fragmentary bits of fossils, but for\r\npractical purposes we might as well be without them. For the present the\r\nactual plants of the Older Palæozoic must remain in a misty obscurity,\r\ntheir forms we can imagine, but not know.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, of the more recent periods, those succeeding the\r\nCarboniferous, we have a little more knowledge. Yet for all these\r\nperiods, even the Tertiary immediately preceding the present day, our\r\nknowledge is far less exact and far less detailed than it is for that\r\nunique period, the Carboniferous itself.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic plants of the Carboniferous period are all very\r\ndifferent from those of the present, and every plant of that date is now\r\nextinct. In the succeeding periods the main types of vegetation changed,\r\nand with each succeeding change advanced a step towards the stage now\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThe Permian, geologically speaking, was a period of transition. Toward\r\nthe close of the Carboniferous there were many important earth movements\r\nwhich raised the level of the land and tended to enclose the area of\r\nwater in what is now Eastern Europe, and to make a continental area with\r\ninland seas. Many of the Carboniferous genera are found to extend through\r\nthe Permian and then die out, while at the same time others became quite\r\nextinct as the physical conditions changed. The seed-bearing plants\r\nbecame relatively more important, and though the genus _Cordaites_ died\r\nout at the end of the period it was succeeded by an increasing number of\r\nothers of more advanced type.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the older Mesozoic rocks, we have in England at any rate\r\nan area which was slowly submerging again. The more important of the\r\nplants which are preserved, and they are unfortunately all too few, are\r\nof a type which has not yet appeared in the earlier rocks, and are in\r\nsome ways like the living _Cycas_, though they have many characters\r\nfundamentally different from any living type. In the vegetation of this\r\ntime, plants of Cycad-like appearance seem to have largely predominated,\r\nand may certainly be taken as the characteristic feature of the period.\r\nThe great Lycopod and Equisetum-like trees of the Carboniferous are\r\nrepresented now only by smaller individuals of the same groups, and\r\npractically all the genera which were flourishing in the Carboniferous\r\ntimes have become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe Cycad-like plants, however, were far more numerous and varied in\r\ncharacter and widely spread than they ever were in any succeeding time.\r\nStill, no flowers (as we understand the word to-day) had appeared, or at\r\nleast we have no indication in any fossil hitherto discovered, that true\r\nflowers were evolved until towards the end of the period (see, however,\r\nChapter X).\r\n\r\nThe newer Mesozoic or Upper Cretaceous period represents a relatively\r\ndeep sea area over England, and the rocks then formed are now known as\r\nthe chalk, which was all deposited under an ocean of some size whose\r\nwater must have been clear, and on the whole free from ordinary débris,\r\nfor the chalk is a remarkably homogeneous deposit. From the point of view\r\nof plant history, the Upper Mesozoic is notable, because in it the\r\nflowering plants take a suddenly important position. Beds of this age\r\n(though of very different physical nature) are known all over the world,\r\nand in them impressions of leaves and fruits, or their casts, are well\r\nrepresented. The leaves are those of both Monocotyledons and\r\nDicotyledons, and the genera are usually directly comparable with those\r\nnow living, and sometimes so similar that they appear to belong to the\r\nsame genus. The cone-bearing groups of the Gymnosperms are still present\r\nand are represented by a number of forms, but they are far fewer in\r\nvarieties than are the groups of flowering plants—while the Cycad-like\r\nplants, so important in the Lower Mesozoic, have relatively few\r\nrepresentatives. There is, it almost seems, a sudden jump from the\r\nflowerless type of vegetation of the Lower Mesozoic, to a flora in the\r\nUpper Mesozoic which is strikingly like that of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary period is a short one (geologically speaking, and compared\r\nwith those going before it), and during it the land level rose again\r\ngradually, suffering many great series of earth movements which built\r\nmost of the mountain chains in Europe which are standing to the present\r\nday. In the many plant-containing deposits of this age, we find specimens\r\nindicating that the flora was very similar to the plants now living, and\r\nthat flowering plants held the dominant position in the forests, as they\r\ndo to-day. In fact, from the point of view of plant evolution, it is\r\nalmost an arbitrary and unnecessary distinction to separate the Tertiary\r\nepoch from the present, because the main features of the vegetation are\r\nso similar. There are, however, such important differences in the\r\ndistribution of the plants of the Tertiary and those of the present\r\ntimes, that the distinction is advisable; but it must always be\r\nremembered that it is not comparable with the wide differences between\r\nthe other epochs.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants now living we find representatives of most, though not\r\nof all, of the great _groups_ of plants which have flourished in the\r\npast, though in the course of time all the species have altered and those\r\nof the earliest earth periods have become extinct. The relative\r\nimportance of the different groups changes greatly in the various\r\nperiods, and as we proceed through the ages of time we see the dominant\r\nplace in the plant world held successively by increasingly advanced\r\ntypes, while the plants which dominated earlier epochs dwindle and take a\r\nsubordinate position. For example, the great trees of the Carboniferous\r\nperiod belonged to the Lycopod family, which to-day are represented by\r\nsmall herbs creeping along the ground. The Cycad-like plants of the\r\nMesozoic, which grew in such luxuriance and in such variety, are now\r\nrestricted to a small number of types scattered over the world in\r\nisolated localities.\r\n\r\nDuring all the periods of which we have any knowledge there existed a\r\nrich and luxuriant vegetation composed of trees, large ferns, and small\r\nherbs of various kinds, but the members of this vegetation have changed\r\nfundamentally with the changing earth, and unlike the earth in her\r\nrock-forming they have never repeated themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                       STAGES IN PLANT EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo attempt any discussion of the _causes_ of evolution is far beyond the\r\nscope of the present work. At present we must accept life as we find it,\r\nendowed with an endless capacity for change and a continuous impulse to\r\nadvance. We can but study in some degree the _course_ taken by its\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nFrom the most primitive beginnings of the earliest periods, enormous\r\nadvance had been made before we have any detailed records of the forms.\r\nYet there remain in the world of to-day numerous places where the types\r\nwith the simplest structure can still flourish, and successfully compete\r\nwith higher forms. Many places which, from the point of view of the\r\nhigher plants, are undesirable, are well suited to the lower. Such\r\nplaces, for example, as the sea, and on land the small nooks and crannies\r\nwhere water drops collect, which are useless for the higher plants,\r\nsuffice for the minute forms. In some cases the lower plants may grow in\r\nsuch masses together as to capture a district and keep the higher plants\r\nfrom it. Equisetum (the horsetail) does this by means of an extensive\r\nsystem of underground rhizomes which give the plant a very strong hold on\r\na piece of land which favours it, so that the flowering plants may be\r\nquite kept from growing there.\r\n\r\nIn such places, by a variety of means, plants are now flourishing on the\r\nearth which represent practically all the main stages of development of\r\nplant life as a whole. It is to the study of the simpler of the living\r\nforms that we owe most of our conceptions of the course taken by\r\nevolution. Had we to depend on fossil evidence alone, we should be in\r\nalmost complete ignorance of the earliest types of vegetation and all the\r\nsimpler cohorts of plants, because their minute size and very delicate\r\nstructure have always rendered them unsuitable for preservation in stone.\r\nAt the same time, had we none of the knowledge of the numerous fossil\r\nforms which we now possess, there would be great gaps in the series which\r\nno study of living forms could supply. It is only by a study and\r\ncomparison of both living and fossil plants of all kinds and from beds of\r\nall ages that we can get any true conception of the whole scheme of plant\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nGrouping together all the main families of plants at present known to us\r\nto exist or to have existed, we get the following series:—\r\n\r\n      Group.        Common examples of typical families in the group.\r\n\r\n  Thallophyta\r\n      Algæ               Seaweeds.\r\n      Fungi              Moulds and toadstools.\r\n  Bryophyta\r\n      Hepaticæ           Liverworts.\r\n      Musci              Mosses.\r\n  Pteridophyta\r\n      Equisetales        Horsetails.\r\n      Sphenophyllales*   fossil only, _Sphenophyllum_.\r\n      Lycopodales        Club-moss.\r\n      Filicales          Bracken fern.\r\n  Pteridospermæ\r\n      Lyginodendræ*      fossil only, _Sphenopteris_.\r\n  Gymnosperms\r\n      Cycadales          Cycads.\r\n      Bennettitales*     fossil only, _Bennettites_.\r\n      Ginkgoales         Maidenhair Tree.\r\n      Cordaitales*       fossil only, _Cordaites_.\r\n      Coniferales        Pine, Yew.\r\n      Gnetales           Welwitschia.\r\n  Angiosperms\r\n      Monocotyledons     Lily, Palm, Grass.\r\n      Dicotyledons       Rose, Oak, Daisy.\r\n\r\nIn this table the different groups have not a strictly equivalent\r\nscientific value, but each of those in the second column represents a\r\nlarge and well-defined series of primary importance, whose members could\r\nnot possibly be included along with any of the other groups.\r\n\r\nThose marked with an asterisk are known only as fossils, and it will be\r\nseen that of the seventeen groups, so many as four are known only in the\r\nfossil state. This indicates, however, but a part of their importance,\r\nfor in nearly every other group are many families or genera which are\r\nonly known as fossils, though there are living representatives of the\r\ngroup as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn this table the individual families are not mentioned, because for the\r\npresent we need only the main outline of classification to illustrate the\r\nprincipal facts about the course of evolution. As the table is given, the\r\nsimplest families come first, the succeeding ones gradually increasing in\r\ncomplexity till the last group represents the most advanced type with\r\nwhich we are acquainted, and the one which is the dominant group of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nThis must not be taken as a suggestion that the members of this series\r\nhave evolved directly one from the other in the order in which they stand\r\nin the table. That is indeed far from the case, and the relations between\r\nthe groups are highly complex.\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked here that it is often difficult, even impossible, to\r\ndecide which are the most highly evolved members of any group of plants.\r\nEach individual of the higher families is a very complicated organism\r\nconsisting of many parts, each of which has evolved more or less\r\nindependently of the others in response to some special quality of the\r\nsurroundings. For instance, one plant may require, and therefore evolve,\r\na very complex and well-developed water-carriage system while retaining a\r\nsimple type of flower; another may grow where the water problem does not\r\ntrouble it, but where it needs to develop special methods for getting its\r\novules pollinated; and so on, in infinite variety. As a result of this,\r\nin almost all plants we have some organs highly evolved and specialized,\r\nand others still in a primitive or relatively primitive condition. It is\r\nonly possible to determine the relative positions of plants on the scale\r\nof development by making an average conclusion from the study of the\r\ndetails of all their parts. This, however, is beset with difficulties,\r\nand in most cases the scientist, weighed by personal inclinations,\r\narbitrarily decides on one or other character to which he pays much\r\nattention as a criterion, while another scientist tends to lay stress on\r\ndifferent characters which may point in another direction.\r\n\r\nIn no group is this better illustrated than among the Coniferæ, where the\r\nrelative arrangement of the different families included in it is still\r\nvery uncertain, and where the observations of different workers, each\r\ndealing mainly with different characters in the plants, tend to\r\ncontradict each other.\r\n\r\nThis, however, as a byword. Notwithstanding these difficulties, which it\r\nwould be unfair to ignore, the main scheme of evolution stands out\r\nclearly before the scientist of to-day, and his views are largely\r\nsupported by many important facts from both fossil and living plants.\r\n\r\nVery strong evidence points to the conclusion that the most primitive\r\nplants of early time were, like the simplest plants of to-day, water\r\ndwellers. Whether in fresh water or the sea is an undecided point, though\r\nopinion seems to incline in general to the view that the sea was the\r\nfirst home of plant life. It can, however, be equally well, and perhaps\r\neven more successfully argued, that the freshwater lakes and streams were\r\nthe homes of the first families from which the higher plants have\r\ngradually been evolved.\r\n\r\nFor this there is no direct evidence in the rocks, for the minute forms\r\nof the single soft cells assumed by the most primitive types were just\r\nsuch as one could not expect to be successfully fossilized. Hence the\r\nearliest stages must be deduced from a comparative study of the simplest\r\nplants now living. Fortunately there is much material for this in the\r\nnumerous waters of the earth, where swarms of minute types in many stages\r\nof complexity are to be found.\r\n\r\nThe simplest type of plants now living, which appears to be capable of\r\nevolution on lines which might have led to the higher plants, is that\r\nfound in various members of the group of the Protococcoideæ among the\r\nAlgæ. The claim of bacteria and other primitive organisms of various\r\nkinds to the absolute priority of existence is one which is entirely\r\nbeyond the scope of a book dealing with fossil plants. The early\r\nevolution of the simple types of the Protococcoideæ is also somewhat\r\nbeyond its scope, but as they appear to lie on the most direct “line of\r\ndescent” of the majority of the higher plants it cannot be entirely\r\nignored. From the simpler groups of the green Algæ other types have\r\nspecialized and advanced along various directions, but among them there\r\nseems an inherent limitation, and none but the protococcoid forms seem to\r\nindicate the possibility of really high development.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17.—A Protococcoid Plant consisting of one cell\r\n\r\n  _p_, Protoplasm; _n_, nucleus; _g_, colouring body or chloroplast; _w_,\r\n  cell wall.]\r\n\r\nIn a few words, a typical example of one of the simple Protococcoideæ may\r\nbe described as consisting of a mass of protoplasm in which lie a\r\nrecognizable nucleus and a green colouring body or chloroplast, with a\r\ncell wall or skin surrounding these vital structures, a cell wall that\r\nmay at times be dispensed with or unusually thickened according as the\r\nneed arises. This plant is represented in fig. 17 in a somewhat\r\ndiagrammatic form.\r\n\r\nIn such a case the whole plant consists of one single cell, living\r\nsurrounded by the water, which supplies it with the necessary food\r\nmaterials, and also protects it from drying up and from immediate contact\r\nwith any hard or injurious object. When these plants propagate they\r\ndivide into four parts, each one similar to the original cell, which all\r\nremain together within the main cell wall for a short time before they\r\nseparate.\r\n\r\nIf now we imagine that the four cells do not separate, but remain\r\ntogether permanently, we can see the possibility of a beginning of\r\nspecialization in the different parts of the cell. The single living cell\r\nis equally acted on from all sides, and in itself it must perform all the\r\nlife functions; but where four lie together, each of the four cells is no\r\nlonger equally acted on from all sides. This shows clearly in the diagram\r\nof a divided cell given in fig. 18. Here it is obvious that one side of\r\neach of the four cells, viz. that named _a_ in the diagram, is on the\r\noutside and in direct contact with the water and external things; but\r\nwalls _b_ and _c_ touch only the corresponding walls of the neighbouring\r\ncells. Through walls _b_ and _c_ no food and water can enter directly,\r\nbut at the same time they are protected from injury and external\r\nstimulus. Hence, in this group of four cells there is a slight\r\ndifferentiation of the sides of the cells. If now we imagine that each of\r\nthe four cells, still remaining in contact, divides once more into four\r\nmembers, each of which reaches mature size while all remain together,\r\nthen we have a group of sixteen cells, some of which will be entirely\r\ninside, and some of which will have walls exposed to the environment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 18.—Diagram of Protococcoid Cell divided into four\r\n  daughter cells. Walls _a_ are external, and walls _b_ and _c_ in\r\n  contact with each other.]\r\n\r\nIf the cells of the group all divide again, in the manner shown the mass\r\nwill become more than one cell thick, and the inner cells will be more\r\ncompletely differentiated, for they will be entirely cut off from the\r\noutside and all direct contact with water and food materials, and will\r\ndepend on what the outer cells transmit to them. The outer cells will\r\nbecome specialized for protection and also for the absorption of the\r\nwater and salts and air for the whole mass. From such a plastic group of\r\ngreen cells it is probable that the higher and increasingly complex forms\r\nof plants have evolved. There are still living plants which correspond\r\nwith the groups of four, sixteen, &c., cells just now theoretically\r\nstipulated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 19.—A, Details of Part of the Tissues in a Stem of\r\n  a Flowering Plant. B, Diagram of the Whole Arrangement of Cross Section\r\n  of a Stem: _e_, Outer protecting skin; _g_, green cells; _s_,\r\n  thick-walled strengthening cells; _p_, general ground tissue cells. V,\r\n  Groups of special conducting tissues: _x_, vessels for water carriage;\r\n  _px_, first formed of the water vessels; _c_, growing cells to add to\r\n  the tissues; _b_, food-conducting cells; _ss_, strengthening cells.]\r\n\r\nThe higher plants of to-day all consist of very large numbers of cells\r\nforming tissues of different kinds, each of which is specialized more or\r\nless, some very elaborately, for the performance of certain functions of\r\nimportance for the plant body as a whole. With the increase in the number\r\nof cells forming the solid plant body, the number of those living wholly\r\ncut off from the outside becomes increasingly great in comparison with\r\nthose forming the external layer. Some idea of the complexity and\r\ndifferentiation of this cell mass is given in fig. 19, A, which shows the\r\nrelative sizes and shapes of the cells composing a small part of the stem\r\nof a common flowering plant. The complete section would be circular and\r\nthe groups V would be repeated round it symmetrically, and the whole\r\nwould be enclosed by an unbroken layer of the cells marked _e_, as in the\r\ndiagram B.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 20.—Conducting Cells and Surrounding Tissue seen in\r\n  fig. 19, A, cut lengthways. _px_, First formed vessels for water\r\n  conduction; _x_, larger vessel; _b_, food-conducting cells; _ss_,\r\n  strengthening cells; _p_, general ground tissue.]\r\n\r\nIn the tissues of the higher plants the most important feature is the\r\ncomplex system of conducting tissues, shown in the young condition in V\r\nin fig. 19, A. In them the food and water conducting elements are very\r\nmuch elongated and highly specialized cells, which run between the others\r\nmuch like a system of pipes in the brickwork of a house. These cells are\r\nshown cut longitudinally in fig. 20, where they are lettered to\r\ncorrespond with the cells in fig. 19, A, with which they should be\r\ncompared. In such a view the great difference between the highly\r\nspecialized cells _x_, _px_, _b_, &c., and those of the main mass of\r\nground tissue _p_ becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nEven in the comparatively simply organized groups of the Equisetales and\r\nLycopodiales the differentiation of tissues is complete. In the mosses,\r\nand still more in the liverworts, it is rudimentary; but they grow in\r\nvery damp situations, where the conduction of water and the protection\r\nfrom too much drying is not a difficult problem for them. As plants grow\r\nhigher into the air, or inhabit drier situations, the need of\r\nspecialization of tissues becomes increasingly great, for they are\r\nincreasingly liable to be dried, and therefore need a better flow of\r\nwater and a more perfect protective coat.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to point out how the individual cells of a plant, such as\r\nthat figured in figs. 19 and 20, have specialized away from the simple\r\ntype of the protococcoid cell in their mature form. In the young growing\r\nparts of a plant, however, they are essentially like protococcoid cells\r\nof squarish outline, fitting closely to each other to make a solid mass,\r\nfrom which the individual types will differentiate later and take on the\r\nform suitable for the special part they have to play in the economy of\r\nthe whole plant.\r\n\r\nTo trace the specialization not only of the tissues but of the various\r\nparts of the whole plant which have become elaborate organs, such as\r\nleaves, stems, and flowers, is a task quite beyond the present work to\r\nattempt. From the illustrations given of tissue structure from plants at\r\nthe two ends of the series much can be imagined of the inevitable\r\nintermediate stages in tissue evolution.\r\n\r\nAs regards the elaboration of organs, and particularly of the\r\nreproductive organs, details will be found throughout the book. In\r\njudging of the place of any plant in the scale of evolution it is to the\r\nreproductive organs that we look for the principal criteria, for the\r\nreproductive organs tend to be influenced less by their physical\r\nsurroundings than the vegetative organs, and are therefore truer guides\r\nto natural relationships.\r\n\r\nIn the essential cells of the reproductive organs, viz. the egg cell and\r\nthe male cell, we get the most primitively organized cells in the plant\r\nbody. In the simpler families both male and female cells return to the\r\ncondition of a free-swimming protococcoid cell, and in all but the\r\nhighest families the male cell requires a liquid environment, in which it\r\n_swims_ to the egg cell. In the higher families the necessary water is\r\nprovided within the structure of the seed, and the male cell does not\r\nswim, a naked, solitary cell, out into the wide world, as it does in all\r\nthe families up to and including the Filicales. In the Coniferæ and\r\nAngiosperms the male cell does not swim, but is passive (or largely so),\r\nand is brought to the egg cell. One might almost say that the whole\r\nevolution of the complex structures found in fruiting cones and flowers\r\nis a result of the need of protection of the delicate, simple\r\nreproductive cells and the embryonic tissues resulting from their fusion.\r\nThe lower plants scatter these delicate cells broadcast in enormous\r\nnumbers, the higher plants protect each single egg cell by an elaborate\r\nseries of tissues, and actually bring the male cell to it without ever\r\nallowing either of them to be exposed.\r\n\r\nIt must be assumed that the reader possesses a general acquaintance with\r\nthe living families tabulated on p. 44; those of the fossil groups will\r\nbe given in some detail in succeeding chapters which deal with the\r\nhistories of the various families. It is premature to attempt any general\r\ndiscussion of the evolution of the various groups till all have been\r\nstudied, so that this will be reserved for the concluding chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n      MINUTE STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS—LIKENESSES TO LIVING ONES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe individual plants of the Coal Measure period differed entirely from\r\nthose now living; they were more than merely distinct species, for in the\r\nmain even the families were largely different from the present ones.\r\nNevertheless, when we come to examine the minute anatomy of the fossils,\r\nand the cells of which they are composed, we find that between the living\r\nand the fossil cell types the closest similarity exists.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of which we have any knowledge the elements of\r\nthe plant body have been the same, though the types of structures which\r\nthey built have varied in plan. Individual _cells_ of nearly every type\r\nfrom the Coal Measure period can be identically matched with those of\r\nto-day. In the way the walls thickened, in the shapes of the wood,\r\nstrengthening or epidermal cells, in the form of the various tissues\r\nadapted to specific purposes, there is a unity of organization which it\r\nis reasonable to suppose depends on the fundamental qualities inherent in\r\nplant life.\r\n\r\nThis will be illustrated best, perhaps, by tabulating the chief\r\nmodifications of cells which are found in plant tissues. The\r\nillustrations of these types in the following table are taken from living\r\nplants, because from them figures of more diagrammatic clearness can be\r\nmade, and the salient characters of the cells more easily recognized.\r\nComparison of these typical cells with those illustrated from the fossil\r\nplants reveals their identity in essential structure, and most of them\r\nwill be found in the photos of fossils in these pages, though they are\r\nbetter recognized in the actual fossils themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Principal Types of Plant Cells\r\n\r\nEpidermal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 21\r\n\r\n  _Epidermis._—Protecting layer or skin.

Compare fig. 114, fossil.]\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many minor varieties of cells, but these illustrate\r\nall the main types.\r\n\r\nAmong the early fossils, however, one type of wood cell and one type of\r\nbast cell, so far as we know, are not present. These cells are the true\r\n_vessels_ of the wood of flowering plants, and the long bast cells with\r\ntheir companion proteid cells. The figure of a metaxylem wood cell, shown\r\nin fig. 31, _t_, shows the more primitive type of wood cell, which has an\r\noblique cross wall. This type of wood cell is found in all the fossil\r\ntrees, and all the living plants except the flowering plants. The vessel\r\ntype, which is that in the big wood vessels of the flowering plants, and\r\nhas no cross wall, is seen in fig. 20, _x_.\r\n\r\nThe similarity between the living cells and those of the Coal Measure\r\nfossils is sufficiently illustrated to need no further comment. This\r\nsimilarity is an extremely helpful point when we come to an\r\ninterpretation of the fossils. In living plants we can study the\r\nphysiology of the various kinds of cells, and can deduce from experiment\r\nexactly the part they play in the economy of the whole plant. From a\r\nstudy of the tissues in any plant structure we know what function it\r\nperformed, and can very often estimate the nature of the surrounding\r\nconditions under which the plant was growing. To take a single example,\r\nthe palisade tissue, illustrated in fig. 25, _p_, in living plants always\r\ncontains green colouring matter, and lies just below the epidermis,\r\nusually of leaves, but sometimes also of green stems. These cells do most\r\nof the starch manufacture for the plant, and are found best developed\r\nwhen exposed to a good light. In very shady places the leaves seldom have\r\nthis type of cell. Now, when cells just like these are found in fossils\r\n(as is illustrated in fig. 34), we can assume all the physiological facts\r\nmentioned above, and rest assured that that leaf was growing under normal\r\nconditions of light and was actively engaged in starch-building when it\r\nwas alive. From the physiological standpoint the fossil leaf is entirely\r\nthe same as a normal living one.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 34.—From a Photo of a Fossil Lea\r\n\r\n  _e_, Epidermis; _p_, palisade cells; _pr_, soft parenchyma cells\r\n  (poorly preserved); _s_, sclerenchyma above the vascular bundle.]\r\n\r\nFrom the morphological standpoint, also, the features of the plant body\r\nfrom the Coal Measure period fall into the same divisions as those of the\r\npresent. Roots, stems, leaves, and reproductive organs, the essentially\r\ndistinct parts of a plant, are to be found in a form entirely\r\nrecognizable, or sufficiently like that now in vogue to be interpreted\r\nwithout great difficulty. In the detailed structure of the reproductive\r\norgans more changes have taken place than in any others, both in internal\r\norganization and external appearance.\r\n\r\nAlready, in the Early Palæozoic period, the distinction between leaves,\r\nstems, roots, and reproductive organs was as clearly marked as it is\r\nto-day, and, judging by their structure, they must each have performed\r\nthe physiological functions they now do. Roots have changed least in the\r\ncourse of time, probably because, in the earth, they live under\r\ncomparatively uniform conditions in whatever period of the world’s\r\nhistory they are growing. Naturally, between the roots of different\r\nspecies there are slight differences; but the likeness between fern roots\r\nfrom the Palæozoic and from a living fern is absolutely complete. This is\r\nillustrated in fig. 35, which shows the microscopic structure of the two\r\nroots when cut in transverse direction. The various tissues will be\r\nrecognized as coming into the table on p. 54, so that both in the details\r\nof individual cells and in the general arrangement of the cell groups or\r\ntissues the roots of these fossil and living ferns agree.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 35.—A, Root of Living Fern. B, Root of Palæozoic\r\n  Fossil Fern. _c_, Cortex; _px_, protoxylem in two groups; _m_,\r\n  metaxylem; _s_, space in fossil due to decay of soft cells.]\r\n\r\nAmong stems there has been at all periods more variety than among the\r\nroots of the corresponding plants, and in the following chapter, when the\r\ndifferences between living and fossil plants will be considered, there\r\nwill be several important structures to notice. Nevertheless, there are\r\nvery many characters in which the stems from such widely different epochs\r\nagree. The plants in the palæozoic forests were of many kinds, and among\r\nthem were those with weak trailing stems which climbed over and supported\r\nthemselves on other plants, and also tall, sturdy shafts of woody trees,\r\nmany of which were covered with a corky bark. Leaves were attached to the\r\nstems, either directly, as in the case of some living plants, or by leaf\r\nstalks. In external appearance and in general function the stems then\r\nwere as stems are now. In the details of the individual cells also the\r\nlikeness is complete; it is in the grouping of the cells, the anatomy of\r\nthe tissues, that the important differences lie. It has been remarked\r\nalready that increase in complexity of the plant form usually goes with\r\nan increase in complexity of the cells and variety of the tissues. The\r\ngeneral ground tissue in nearly all plants is very similar; it is\r\nprincipally in the vascular system that the advance and variety lie.\r\n\r\nPlant anatomists lay particular stress on the vascular system, which, in\r\ncomparison with animal anatomy, holds an even more important position\r\nthan does the skeleton. To understand the essential characters of stems,\r\nboth living and fossil, and to appreciate their points of likeness or\r\ndifference, it is necessary to have some knowledge of the general facts\r\nof anatomy; hence the main points on which stress is laid will be given\r\nnow in brief outline.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside consideration of the more rudimentary and less defined\r\nstructure of the algæ and mosses, all plants may be said to possess a\r\n“vascular system”. This is typically composed of elongated wood (or\r\nxylem) with accessory cells (see p. 57, table), and bast (phloem), also\r\nwith accessory cells. These specialized conducting elements lie in the\r\nground tissue, and in nearly all cases are cut off from direct contact\r\nwith it by a definite sheath, called the endodermis (see p. 55, fig. 26).\r\nVery often there are also groups or rings of hard thick-walled cells\r\nassociated with the vascular tissues, which protect them and play an\r\nimportant part in the consolidation of the whole stem.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 36.—Diagram of Simplest Arrangement of Complete\r\n  Stele in a Stem\r\n\r\n  W, Central solid wood; P, ring of bast; E, enclosing sheath of\r\n  endodermis; C, ground tissue or cortex.]\r\n\r\nThe simplest, and probably evolutionally the most primitive form which is\r\ntaken by the vascular tissues, is that of a single central strand, with\r\nthe wood in the middle, the bast round it, and a circular endodermis\r\nenclosing all, as in fig. 36, which shows a diagram of this arrangement.\r\nSuch a mass of wood and bast surrounded by an endodermis, is technically\r\nknown as a _stele_, a very convenient term which is much used by\r\nanatomists. In its simplest form (as in fig. 36) it is called a\r\n_protostele_, and is to be found in both living and fossil plants. A\r\nnumber of plants which get more complex steles later on, have protosteles\r\nin the early stages of their development, as in _Pteris aurita_ for\r\nexample, a species allied to the bracken fern, which has a hollow ring\r\nstele when mature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 37.—Diagram of a Stele with a few Cells of Pith _p_\r\n  in the Middle of the Wood. Lettering as in fig. 36]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 38.—Diagram showing Extensive Pith _p_ in the Wood.\r\n  Lettering as in fig. 36]\r\n\r\nThe next type of stele is quite similar to the protostele, but with the\r\naddition of a few large unspecialized cells in the middle of the wood\r\n(_p_, fig. 37); these are the commencement of the hollowing process which\r\ngoes on in the wood, resulting later in the formation of a considerable\r\npith, as is seen in fig. 38, where the wood is now a hollow cylinder, as\r\nthe phloem has been from the first. When this is the case, a second\r\nsheath or endodermis generally develops on the inner side of the wood,\r\noutside the pith, and cuts the vascular tissues off from the inner\r\nparenchyma. A further step is the development of an inner cylinder of\r\nbast so that the vascular ring is completely double, with endodermis on\r\nboth sides of the cylinder, as is seen in fig. 39.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 39.—A Cylindrical Stele, with _e_, inner\r\n  endodermis, and _ph_, inner phloem; W, wood; P, outer phloem; E, outer\r\n  endodermis. L, part of the stele going out to supply a large leaf, thus\r\n  breaking what would otherwise appear as a closed ring stele]\r\n\r\nIn all these cases there is but one strand or cylinder, of vascular\r\ntissue in the stem, but one stele, and this type of anatomy is known as\r\nthe _monostelic_ or single-steled type.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 40.—A Ring Stele apparently broken up into a Number\r\n  of Protosteles by many Leaf Gaps]\r\n\r\nWhen from the double cylinder just described a strand of tissue goes off\r\nto supply a large leaf, a considerable part of the stele goes out and\r\nbreaks the ring. This is shown in fig. 39, where L is the part of the\r\nstele going to a leaf, and the rest the broken central cylinder. When the\r\nstem is short, and leaves grow thickly so that bundles are constantly\r\ngoing out from the main cylinder, this gets permanently broken, and its\r\nappearance when cut across at any given point is that of a group of\r\nseveral steles arranged in a ring, each separate stele being like the\r\nsimple protostele in its structure. See fig. 40. This type of stem has\r\nlong been known as _polystelic_ (_i.e._ many-steled), and it is still a\r\nconvenient term to describe it by. There has been much theoretical\r\ndiscussion about the true meaning of such a “polystelic” stem, which\r\ncannot be entered into here; it may be noted, however, that the various\r\nstrands of the broken ring join up and form a meshwork when we consider\r\nthe stem as a whole, it is only in a single section that they appear as\r\nquite independent protosteles. Nevertheless, as we generally consider the\r\nanatomy of stems in terms of single sections, and as the descriptive word\r\n“polystelic” is a very convenient and widely understood term, it will be\r\nused throughout the book when speaking of this type of stem anatomy.\r\n\r\nSuch a type as this, shown in fig. 40, is already complex, but it often\r\nhappens that the steles branch and divide still further, until there is a\r\nhighly complicated and sometimes bewildering system of vascular strands\r\nrunning through the ground tissue in many directions, but cut off from it\r\nby their protective endodermal sheaths. Such complex systems are to be\r\nfound both in living and fossil plants, more especially in many of the\r\nlarger ferns (see fig. 88).\r\n\r\nHigher plants in general, however, and in particular flowering plants, do\r\nnot have a polystelic vascular arrangement, but a specialized type of\r\nmonostele.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 41.—Monostele in which the Central Pith is\r\n  Star-shaped, and the Wood breaking up into Separate Groups\r\n\r\n  _p_, Pith; W, wood; P, phloem; E, endodermis; C, cortex.]\r\n\r\nReferring again to fig. 37 as a starting-point, imagine the pith in the\r\ncentre to spread in a star-shaped form till the points of the star\r\ntouched the edges of the ring, and thus to break the wood ring into\r\ngroups. A stage in this process (which is not yet completed) is shown in\r\nfig. 41, while in fig. 42 the wood and bast groups are entirely distinct.\r\nIn the flowering plants the cells of the endodermis are frequently poorly\r\ncharacterized, and the pith cells resemble those of the cortical ground\r\ntissue, so that the separate groups of wood and bast (usually known as\r\n“vascular bundles”, in distinction from the “steles” of fig. 40) appear\r\nto lie independently in the ground tissue. These strands, however, must\r\nnot be confused with steles, they are only fragments of the single\r\napparently broken up stele which runs in the stem.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 42.—Monostele in which the Pith has invaded all the\r\n  Tissues as far as the Endodermis, and broken the Wood and Phloem up\r\n  into Separate Bundles. These are usually called “vascular bundles” in\r\n  the flowering plants]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 43.—Showing actively growing Zone _c_ (Cambium) in\r\n  the Vascular Bundles, and joining across the ground tissue between them]\r\n\r\nThe vascular bundle, of all except the Monocotyledons, has a potentiality\r\nfor continued growth and expansion which places it far above the stele in\r\nvalue for a plant of long life and considerable growth. The cells lying\r\nbetween the wood and the bast, the soft parenchyma cells always\r\naccompanying such tissues, retain their vitality and continue to divide\r\nwith great regularity, and to give rise to a continuous succession of new\r\ncells of wood on the one side and bast on the other; see fig. 33, _c_,\r\n_b_. In this way the primary, distinct vascular bundles are joined by a\r\nring of wood, see fig. 43, to which are added further rings every season,\r\ntill the mass of wood becomes a strong solid shaft. This ever-recurring\r\nactivity of the cambium gives rise to what are known as “annual rings” in\r\nstems, see fig. 44, in which the wood shows both primary distinct groups\r\nin the centre, and the rings of growth of later years.\r\n\r\nCambium with this power of long-continued activity is found in nearly all\r\nthe higher plants of to-day (except the Monocotyledons), but in the fern\r\nand lycopod groups it is in abeyance. Certain cases from nearly every\r\nfamily of the Pteridophytes are known, where some slight development of\r\ncambium with its secondary thickening takes place, but in the groups\r\nbelow the Gymnosperms cambium has almost no part to play. On the other\r\nhand, so far back as the Carboniferous period, the masses of wood in the\r\nPteridophyte trees were formed by cambium in just the same way as they\r\nare now in the higher forms. Its presence was almost universal at that\r\ntime in the lower groups where to-day there are hardly any traces of it\r\nto be found.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 44.—Stem with Solid Cylinder of Wood developed from\r\n  the Cambium, showing three “annual rings”. In the centre may still be\r\n  seen the separate groups of the wood of the primary “vascular bundles”]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this short outline of the vascular system of plants,\r\nthat there is much variety possible from modifications of the fundamental\r\nprotostele. It is also to be noted that the plants of the Coal Measures\r\nhad already evolved all the main varieties of steles which are known to\r\nus even now,[6] and that the development of secondary thickening was very\r\nwidespread. In several cases the complexity of type exceeds that of\r\nmodern plants (see Chap. VII), and there are to be found vascular\r\narrangements no longer extant.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the _Reproductive Organs_, we find that the points of\r\nlikeness between the living and the fossil forms are not so numerous or\r\nso direct as they are in the case of the vegetative system.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 45.—Fern Sporangia\r\n\r\n  A, fossil; B, living.]\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated, the families of plants typical of the Coal\r\nMeasures were not those which are the most prominent to-day, but belonged\r\nto the lower series of Pteridophytes. In their simpler forms the\r\nfructifications then and now resemble each other very closely, but in the\r\nmore elaborate developments the points of variety are more striking, so\r\nthat they will be dealt with in the following chapter. Cases of likeness\r\nare seen in the sporangia of ferns, some of which appear to have been\r\npractically identical with those now living. This is illustrated in fig.\r\n45, which shows the outline of the cells of the sporangia of living and\r\nfossil side by side.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 46.—A, Living Lycopod cone; B, _Lepidodendron_\r\n  (fossil) cone. _a_, Axis; _s_, scale; S, sporangium with spores. One\r\n  side of a longitudinal section]\r\n\r\nIn the general structure also of the cones of the simpler types of\r\n_Lepidodendron_ (fossil, see frontispiece) there is a close agreement\r\nwith the living Lycopods, though as regards size and output of spores\r\nthere was a considerable difference in favour of the fossils. The plan of\r\neach is that round the axis of the cone simple scales are arranged, on\r\neach of which, on its upper side, is seated a large sporangium bearing\r\nnumerous spores all of one kind (see fig. 46).\r\n\r\nEqually similar are the cones of the living Equisetum and some of the\r\nsimple members of the fossil family Calamiteæ, but the more interesting\r\ncases are those where differences of an important morphological nature\r\nare to be seen.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second[7] generation there is some very important\r\nevidence, from extremely young stages, which has recently been given to\r\nthe world. In a fern sporangium _germinating spores_ were fossilized so\r\nas to show the first divisions of the spore cell. These seem to be\r\nidentical with the first divisions of some recent ferns (see fig. 47).\r\nThis is not only of interest as showing the close similarity in detail\r\nbetween plants of such widely different ages, but is a remarkable case of\r\ndelicate preservation of soft and most perishable structures in the “coal\r\nballs”.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 47.—Germinating Fern Spores\r\n\r\n  A and B, from carboniferous fossils; C, living fern. (A and B after\r\n  Scott.)]\r\n\r\nWhile these few cases illustrate points of likeness between the\r\nfructifications of the Coal Measures and of to-day, the large size and\r\nsuccessful character of the primitive Coal Measure plants was accompanied\r\nby many developments on the part of their reproductive organs which are\r\nno longer seen in living forms, and the greater number of palæozoic\r\nfructifications must be considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n     MINUTE STRUCTURE OF FOSSIL PLANTS—DIFFERENCES FROM LIVING ONES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the last chapter that the main morphological divisions,\r\nroots, stems, leaves, and fructifications, were as distinct in the Coal\r\nMeasure period as they are now. There is one structure, however, found in\r\nthe Coal Measure fossils, which is hardly paralleled by anything similar\r\nin the living plants, and that is the fossil known as _Stigmaria_.\r\n_Stigmaria_ is the name given, not to a distinct species of plant, but to\r\nthe large rootlike organs which we know to have belonged to all the\r\nspecies of _Lepidodendron_ and of _Sigillaria_. In the frontispiece these\r\norgans are well seen, and branch away at the foot of the trunk, spreading\r\nhorizontally, to all appearance merely large roots. They are especially\r\nregularly developed, however, the main trunk giving rise always to four\r\nprimary branches, these each dividing into two equal branches, and so\r\non—in this they are unlike the usual roots of trees. They bore numerous\r\nrootlets, of which we know the structure very well, as they are the\r\ncommonest of all fossils, but in their internal anatomy the main “roots”\r\nhad not the structure which is characteristic of roots, but were like\r\n_stems_. In living plants there are many examples of stems which run\r\nunderground, but they always have at least the rudiments of leaves in the\r\nform of scales, while the fossil structures have apparently no trace of\r\neven the smallest scales, but bear only rootlets, thus resembling true\r\nroots. The questions of morphology these structures raise are too complex\r\nto be discussed here, and Stigmaria is only introduced as an example, one\r\nof the very few available, of a palæozoic structure which seems to be of\r\na nature not clearly determinable as either root, stem, leaf, or\r\nfructification. Among living plants the fine rootlike rhizophores of\r\nSelaginella bear some resemblance to Stigmaria in essentials, though so\r\nwidely different from them in many ways, and they are probably the\r\nclosest analogy to be found among the plants of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe individual cells, we have already seen, are strikingly similar in the\r\ncase of fossil and living plants. There are, of course, specific\r\nvarieties peculiar to the fossils, of which perhaps the most striking\r\nseem to be some forms of _hair_ cells. For example, in a species of fern\r\nfrom the French rocks there were multicellular hairs which looked like\r\nlittle stems of Equisetum owing to regular bands of teeth at the\r\njunctions of the cells. These hairs were quite characteristic of the\r\nspecies—but hairs of all sorts have always abounded in variety, so that\r\nsuch distinction has but minor significance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 48.—Stele of _Lepidodendron_ W, surrounded by a\r\n  small ring of secondary wood S]\r\n\r\nAs was noted in the table (p. 58) the only cell types of prime importance\r\nwhich were not evolved by the Palæozoic plants were the wood vessels,\r\nphloem and accompanying cells which are characteristic of the flowering\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossils the vascular arrangements are most interesting, and, as\r\nwell as all the types of stele development noted in the previous chapter\r\nas common to both living and fossil plants, there are further varieties\r\nfound only among the fossils (see fig. 50).\r\n\r\nThe simple protostele described (on p. 61) is still found, particularly\r\nin the very young stages of living ferns, but it is a type of vascular\r\narrangement which is not common in the mature plants of the present day.\r\nIn the Coal Measure period, however, the protostele was characteristic of\r\none of the two main groups of ferns. In different species of these ferns,\r\nthe protostele assumed a large variety of shapes and forms as well as the\r\nsimple cylindrical type. The central mass of wood became five-rayed in\r\nsome, star-shaped, and even very deeply lobed, with slightly irregular\r\narms, but in all these cases it remained fundamentally monostelic.\r\nFrequently secondary tissue developed round the protosteles of plants\r\nwhose living relatives have no such tissue. A case of this kind is\r\nillustrated in fig. 48, which shows a simple circular stele surrounded by\r\na zone of secondary woody tissue in a species of _Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 49.—_Lepidodendron_, showing Part of the Hollow\r\n  Ring of Primary Wood W, with a relatively large amount of Secondary\r\n  Tissue S, surrounding it]\r\n\r\nIn many species of _Lepidodendron_ the quantity of secondary wood formed\r\nround the primary stele was very great, so that (as is the case in higher\r\nplants) the primary wood became relatively insignificant compared with\r\nit. In most species of _Lepidodendron_ the primary stele is a hollow ring\r\nof wood (cf. fig. 38, p. 62) round which the secondary wood developed, as\r\nis seen in fig. 49. These two cases illustrate a peculiarity of fossil\r\nplants. Among living ones the solid and the simple ring stele are almost\r\nconfined to the Pteridophytes, where secondary wood does not develop, but\r\nthe palæozoic Pteridophytes, while having the simple primary types of\r\nsteles, had quantities of secondary tissue, which was correlated with\r\ntheir large size and dominant position.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 50.—Diagram of Steles of  the English _Medullosa_,\r\n  showing three irregular, solid, steles A, with secondary thickenings S,\r\n  all round each. _a_, Small accessory steles]\r\n\r\nAmong _polystelic_ types (see p. 63) we find interesting examples in the\r\nfossil group of the _Medulloseæ_, which are much more complex than any\r\nknown at present, both owing to their primary structure and also to the\r\npeculiar fact that all the steles developed secondary tissue towards the\r\ninner as well as the outer side. One of the simpler members of this\r\nfamily found in the English Coal Measures is illustrated in fig. 50. Here\r\nthere are three principal protosteles (and several irregular minor ones)\r\neach of which has a considerable quantity of secondary tissue all round\r\nit, so that a portion of the secondary wood is growing in towards the\r\nactual centre of the stem as a whole—a very anomalous state of affairs.\r\n\r\nIn the more complex Continental type of _Medullosa_ there are _very_\r\nlarge numbers of steles. In the one figured from the Continent in fig. 51\r\nbut a few are represented. There is a large outer double-ring stele, with\r\nsecondary wood on both sides of it, and within these a number of small\r\nsteles, all scattered through the ground tissue, and each surrounded by\r\nsecondary wood. In actual specimens the number of these central steles is\r\nmuch greater than that indicated in the diagram.\r\n\r\nNo plant exists to-day which has such an arrangement of its vascular\r\ncylinder. It almost appears as though at the early period, when the\r\nMedulloseæ flourished, steles were experimenting in various directions.\r\nSuch types as are illustrated in figs. 50 and 51 are obviously wasteful\r\n(for secondary wood developing towards the centre of a stem is bound to\r\nfinally meet), and complex, but apparently inefficient, which may partly\r\naccount for the fact that this type of structure has not survived to the\r\npresent, though simpler and equally ancient types have done so.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 51.—Continental _Medullosa_, showing R, outer\r\n  double-ring stele with secondary wood all round it; S, inner stellate\r\n  steles, also surrounded in each case by secondary tissue]\r\n\r\nFurther details of the anatomy of fossils will be mentioned when we come\r\nto consider the individual families; those now illustrated suffice to\r\nshow that in the Coal Measures very different arrangements of steles were\r\nto be found, as well as those which were similar to those existing now.\r\nThe significance of these differences will become apparent when their\r\nrelation to the other characters of the plants is considered.\r\n\r\nThe fructifications, always the most important parts of the plant, offer\r\na wide field, and the divergence between the commoner palæozoic and\r\nrecent types seems at first to be very great. Indeed, when palæozoic\r\nreproductive bodies have to be described, it is often necessary to use\r\nthe common descriptive terms in an altered and wider sense.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants of to-day there are many varieties of the simple\r\nsingle-celled reproductive masses which are called _spores_, and which\r\nare usually formed in large numbers inside a spore case or sporangium.\r\nAmong the higher plants _seeds_ are also known in endless variety, all of\r\nwhich, compared with spores, are very complex, for they are many-celled\r\nstructures, consisting essentially of an embryo or young plant enclosed\r\nin various protective coats. The distinction between the two is sharp and\r\nwell defined, and for the student of living plants there exists no\r\ndifficulty in separating and describing seeds and spores.\r\n\r\nBut when we look back through the past eras to palæozoic plants the\r\nsubject is not so easy, and the two main types of potentially\r\nreproductive masses are not sharply distinct. The seed, as we know it\r\namong recent plants, and as it is generally defined, had not fully\r\nevolved; while the spores were of great variety and had evolved in\r\nseveral directions, some of which seem to have been intermediate stages\r\nbetween simple spores and true seeds. These seedlike spores served to\r\nreproduce the plants of the period, but their type has since died out and\r\nleft but two main methods among living plants, namely the essentially\r\nsimple spores, the very simplicity of whose organization gives them a\r\nsecure position, and the complex seeds with their infinite variety of\r\nmethods for protecting and scattering the young embryos they contain.\r\n\r\nAmong the Coal Measure fossils we can pick up some of the early stages in\r\nthe evolution of the seed from the spore, or at least we can examine\r\nintermediate stages between them which give some idea of the possible\r\ncourse of events. Hence, though the differences from our modern\r\nreproductive structures are so noticeable a feature of the palæozoic\r\nones, it will be seen that they are really such differences as exist\r\nbetween the members at the two ends of a series, not such as exist\r\nbetween unrelated objects.\r\n\r\nVery few types can be mentioned here, and to make their relations clear a\r\nshort series of diagrams with explanations will be found more helpful\r\nthan a detailed account of the structures.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 52.—Spores\r\n\r\n  Each spore a single cell which develops with three others in tetrads\r\n  (groups of four). Very numerous tetrads enclosed in a spore case or\r\n  sporangium which develops on a leaflike segment called the sporophyll.\r\n  Each spore germinates independently of the others after being\r\n  scattered, all being of the same size.

Some fossils have such sporangia with eight spores,\r\n  or some other small number; living Selaginellas have four.

Only found in fossils,\r\n  one of the methods of reproduction in _Lepidodendron_. Other sporangia\r\n  with small spores were developed which gave rise to the male organs.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 55.—“Seed”\r\n\r\n  In appearance this is like a seed, but differs from a true seed in\r\n  having no embryo, and is like the preceding structure in having a very\r\n  large spore, S, though there is no trace of the three aborting ones.\r\n  The spore develops in a special mass of tissue known as the nucellus,\r\n  _n_, which partly corresponds to the sporangium wall of the previous\r\n  types. In it a cavity, _p c_, the pollen chamber, receives the pollen\r\n  grains which enter at the apex of the “seed”. There is a complex coat,\r\n  C, which stands round the nucellus but is not joined to it, leaving the\r\n  space _l_ between them. Only in fossils; _Trigonocarpus_ (see p. 122)\r\n  is similarly organized.

Small “spores” form the pollen grains.\r\n  Typical of living Dicotyledons.]\r\n\r\nThese few illustrations represent only the main divisions of an army of\r\nstructures with an almost unimaginable wealth of variety which must be\r\nleft out of consideration.\r\n\r\nFor the structures illustrated in figs. 54, 55, and 56 we have no name,\r\nfor their possible existence was not conceived of when our terminology\r\nwas invented, and no one has yet christened them anew with distinct\r\nnames. They are evidently too complex in organization and too similar to\r\nseeds in several ways to be called spores, yet they lack the essential\r\nelement in a seed, namely, an embryo. The term “ovule” (usually given to\r\nthe young seed which has not yet developed an embryo) does not fit them\r\nany better, for their tissues are ripened and hard, and they were of\r\nlarge size and apparently fully grown and mature.\r\n\r\nFor the present a name is not essential; the one thing that is important\r\nis to recognize their intermediate character and the light they throw on\r\nthe possible evolution of modern seeds.\r\n\r\nA further point of great interest is the manner in which these “seeds”\r\nwere borne on the plant. To-day seeds are always developed (with the\r\nexception of Cycas) in cones or flowers, or at least special\r\ninflorescences. But the “seed” of _Lagenostoma_ (fig. 56), as well as a\r\nnumber of others in the group it represents, were not borne on a special\r\nstructure, but directly on the green foliage leaves. They were in this on\r\na level with the simple sporangia of ferns which appear on the backs of\r\nthe fronds, a fact which is of great significance both for our views on\r\nthe evolution of seeds as such, and for the bearing it has on the\r\nrelationships of the various groups of allied plants. This will be\r\nreferred to subsequently (Chapter XI), and is mentioned now only as an\r\nexample of the difference between some of the characters of early fossils\r\nand those of the present day.\r\n\r\nIt is true that botanists have long recognized the organ which bears\r\nseeds as a modified leaf. The carpels of all the higher plants are looked\r\non as _homologous_ with leaves, although they do not appear to be like\r\nthem externally. Sometimes among living plants curious diseases cause the\r\ncarpels to become foliar, and when this happens the diseased carpel\r\nreverts more or less to the supposed ancestral leaf-like condition. It is\r\nonly among the ancient (but recently discovered) fossils, however, that\r\nseeds are known to be borne normally on foliage leaves.\r\n\r\nFrom Mesozoic plants we shall learn new conceptions about flowers and\r\nreproductive inflorescences in general, but these must be deferred to the\r\nconsideration of the family as a whole (Chapter XIII).\r\n\r\nEnough has been illustrated to show that though the individual cells, the\r\nbricks, so to speak, of plant construction, were so similar in the past\r\nand present, yet the organs built up by them have been continually\r\nvarying, as a child builds increasingly ambitious palaces with the same\r\nset of bricks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                    I. Flowering Plants, Angiosperms\r\n\r\n\r\nIn comparison with the other groups of plants the flowering families are\r\nof recent origin, yet in the sense in which the word is usually used they\r\nare ancient indeed, and the earliest records of them must date at least\r\nto periods hundreds of thousands of years ago.\r\n\r\nThrough all the Tertiary period (see p. 34) there were numerous flowering\r\nplants, and there is evidence that many families of both Monocotyledons\r\nand Dicotyledons existed in the Upper Cretaceous times. Further back than\r\nthis we have little reliable testimony, for the few specimens of\r\nso-called flowering plants from the Lower Mesozoic are for the most part\r\nof a doubtful nature.\r\n\r\nThe flowering plants seem to stand much isolated from the rest of the\r\nplant world; there is no _direct_ evidence of connection between their\r\noldest representatives and any of the more primitive families. So far as\r\nour actual knowledge goes, they might have sprung into being at the\r\nmiddle of the Mesozoic period quite independently of the other plants\r\nthen living; though there are not wanting elaborate and almost convincing\r\ntheories of their connection with more than one group of their\r\npredecessors (see p. 108).\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiarly unfortunate fact that although the rocks of the\r\nCretaceous and Tertiary are so much less ancient than those of the Coal\r\nMeasures, they have preserved for us far less well the plants which were\r\nliving when they were formed. Hitherto no one has found in Mesozoic\r\nstrata masses of exquisitely mineralized Angiosperm fragments[8] like\r\nthose found in the Coal Measures, which tell us so much about the more\r\nancient plants. Cases are known of more or less isolated fragments with\r\ntheir microscopical tissues mineralized. For example, there are some\r\npalms and ferns from South America which show their anatomical structure\r\nvery clearly preserved in silica, and which seem to resemble closely the\r\nliving species of their genera. The bulk of the plants preserved from\r\nthese periods are found in the form of casts or impressions (see p. 10),\r\nwhich, as has been pointed out already, are much less satisfactory to\r\ndeal with, and give much less reliable results than specimens which have\r\nalso their internal structure petrified. The quantity of material,\r\nhowever, is great, and impressions of single leaves innumerable, and of\r\nspecimens of leaves attached to stems, and even of flowers and fruits,\r\nare to be found in the later beds of rock. These are generally clearly\r\nrecognizable as belonging to one or other of the living families of\r\nflowering plants. Leaf impressions are by far the most frequent, and our\r\nknowledge of the Tertiary flora is principally derived from a study of\r\nthem. Their outline and their veins are generally preserved, often also\r\ntheir petioles and some indication of the thickness and character of the\r\nfleshy part of the leaf. From the outline and veins alone an expert is\r\ngenerally able to determine the species to which the plant belongs,\r\nthough it is not always quite safe to trust to these determinations or to\r\ndraw wide-reaching conclusions from them.\r\n\r\nIn fig. 59 is shown a photograph of the impression of a Tertiary leaf,\r\nwhich illustrates the condition of an average good specimen from rocks of\r\nthe period. Its shape and the character of the veins are sufficient to\r\nmark it out immediately as belonging to the Dicotyledonous group of the\r\nflowering plants.\r\n\r\nSeeds and fruits are also to be found; and in some very finely preserved\r\nspecimens from Japan stamens from a flower and delicate seeds are seen\r\nclearly impressed on the light stone. In fig. 60 is illustrated a couple\r\nof such seeds, which show not only their wings but also the small\r\nantennæ-like stigmas. Specimens so perfectly preserved are practically as\r\ngood as herbarium material of recent plants, and in this way the\r\nexternals of the Tertiary plants are pretty well known to us.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 59.—Dicotyledonous Leaf Impression from Tertiary\r\n  Rocks]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 60.—Seeds from Japanese Tertiary Rocks; at _a_ are\r\n  seen the two stigmas still preserved]\r\n\r\nA problem which has long been discussed, and which has aroused much\r\ninterest, is the relative antiquity of the Monocotyledonous and the\r\nDicotyledonous branches of the flowering plants. A peculiar fascination\r\nseems to hang over this still unsolved riddle, and a battle of flowers\r\nmay be said to rage between the lily and the rose for priority. Recent\r\nwork has thrown no decisive light on the question, but it has undoubtedly\r\ndemolished the old view which supposed that the Monocotyledons (the lily\r\ngroup) appeared at a far earlier date upon this earth than the\r\nDicotyledons. The old writers based their contention on incorrectly\r\ndetermined fossils. For instance, seeds from the Palæozoic rocks were\r\ndescribed as Monocotyledons because of the three or six ribs which were\r\nso characteristic of their shell; we know now that these seeds\r\n(_Trigonocarpus_) belong to a family already mentioned in another\r\nconnection (p. 72), the Medulloseæ (see p. 122), the affinity of which\r\nlies between the cycads and the ferns. Leaves of _Cordaites_, again,\r\nwhich are broad and long with well-marked parallel veins, were described\r\nas those of a Monocotyledonous plant like the Yucca of to-day; but we now\r\nknow them to belong to a family of true Gymnosperms possibly distantly\r\nrelated to _Taxus_ (the Yew tree).\r\n\r\nRecent work, which has carefully sifted the fossil evidence, can only say\r\nthat no true Monocotyledons have yet been found below the Lower\r\nCretaceous rocks, and that at that period we see also the sudden inrush\r\nof Dicotyledons. Hence, so far as palæontology can show, the two parallel\r\ngroups of the flowering plants arose about the same time. It is of\r\ninterest to note, however, that the only petrifaction of a flower known\r\nfrom any part of the world is an ovary which seems to be that of one of\r\nthe Liliaceæ. In the same nodules, however, there are several specimens\r\nof Dicotyledonous woods, so that it does not throw any light on the\r\nquestion of priority.\r\n\r\nWith the evidence derived from the comparative study of the anatomy of\r\nrecent flowering plants we cannot concern ourselves here, beyond noting\r\nthat the results weigh in favour of the Dicotyledons as being the more\r\nprimitive, though not necessarily developed much earlier in point of\r\ntime. Until very much more is discovered than is yet known of the origin\r\nof the flowering plants as a whole, it is impossible to come to a more\r\ndefinite conclusion about this much-discussed subject.\r\n\r\nLet us now attempt to picture the vegetable communities since the\r\nappearance of the flowering plants. The facts which form the bases of the\r\nfollowing conceptions have been gathered from many lands by numerous\r\nworkers in the field of fossil botany, from scattered plant remains such\r\nas have been described.\r\n\r\nWhen the flowering plants were heralded in they appeared in large\r\nnumbers, and already by the Cretaceous period there were very many\r\ndifferent species. Of these a number seem to belong to genera which are\r\nstill living, and many of them are extremely like living species. It\r\nwould be wearisome and of little value to give a list of all the recorded\r\nspecies from this period, but a few of the commoner ones may be mentioned\r\nto illustrate the nature of the plants then flourishing.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of _Quercus_ (the Oak) appeared early, particularly\r\n_Quercus Ilex_; leaves of the _Juglandaceæ_ (Walnut family) were very\r\ncommon, and among the Tertiary fossils appear its fruits. Both _Populus_\r\n(the Poplar) and _Salix_ (the Willow) date from the early rocks, while\r\n_Ficus_ (the Fig) was very common, and _Casuarina_ (the Switch Plant)\r\nseems to have been widely spread. Magnolias also were common, and it\r\nappears that _Platanus_ (the Plane) and _Eucalyptus_ coexisted with them.\r\n\r\nIt will be immediately recognized that the above plants have all living\r\nrepresentatives, either wild or cultivated, growing in this country at\r\nthe present day, so that they are more or less familiar objects, and\r\nthere appears to have been no striking difference between the early\r\nflowering plants and those of the present day. Between the ancient\r\nLycopods, for example, and those now living the differences are very\r\nnoteworthy; but the earliest of the known flowering plants seem to have\r\nbeen essentially like those now flourishing. It must be remembered in\r\nthis connection that the existing flowering plants are immensely nearer\r\nin point of time to their origin than are the existing Lycopods, and that\r\nwhen such æons have passed as divide the present from the Palæozoic, the\r\nflowering plants of the future may have dwindled to a subordinate\r\nposition corresponding to that held by the Lycopods now.\r\n\r\nA noticeable character of the early flowering-plant flora, when taken as\r\na whole, is the relatively large proportion of plants in it which belong\r\nto the family _Amentiferæ_ (oaks, willows, poplars, &c.). This is\r\nsupposed by some to indicate that the family is one of the most primitive\r\nstocks of the Angiosperms. This view, however, hardly bears very close\r\nscrutiny, because it derives its main support from the large numbers of\r\nthe Amentiferæ as compared with other groups. Now, the Amentiferæ were\r\n(and are) largely woody resistant plants, whose very nature would render\r\nthem more liable to be preserved as impressions than delicate trees or\r\nherbs, which would more readily decay and leave no trace. Similarly based\r\non uncertain evidence is the surmise that the group of flowers classed as\r\n_Gamopetalæ_ (flowers with petals joined up in a tube, like convolvulus)\r\ndid not flourish in early times, but are the higher and later development\r\nof the flower type. Now, _Viburnum_ (allied to the honeysuckle) belongs\r\nto this group, and it is found right down in the Cretaceous, and\r\n_Sambucus_ (Elder, of the same family) is known in the early Tertiary.\r\nThese two plants are woody shrubs or small trees, while many others of\r\nthe family are herbs, and it is noteworthy that it is just these woody,\r\nresistant forms which are preserved as fossils; their presence\r\ndemonstrates the antiquity of the group as a whole, and the absence of\r\nother members of it may be reasonably attributed to accidents of\r\npreservation. In the Tertiary also we get a member of the heath family,\r\nviz. _Andromeda_, and another tube-flower, _Bignonia_, as well as several\r\nmore _woody_ gamopetalous flowers.\r\n\r\nHence it is wise to be very cautious about drawing any important\r\nconclusions from the relative numbers of the different species, or the\r\nabsence of any type of plant from the lists of those as yet known from\r\nthe Cretaceous. When quantities of structurally preserved material can be\r\nexamined containing the flowering plants in petrifactions, then it will\r\nbe possible to speak with some security of the nature of the Mesozoic\r\nflora as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe positive evidence which is already accumulated, however, is of great\r\nvalue, and from it certain deductions may be safely made. Specimens of\r\nCretaceous plants from various parts of the world seem to indicate that\r\nthere was a very striking uniformity in the flora of that period all over\r\nthe globe. In America and in Central Europe, for example, the same types\r\nof plants were growing. We shall see that, as time advanced, the various\r\ntypes became separated out, dying away in different places, until each\r\ngreat continent and division of land had a special set of plants of its\r\nown. At the commencement of the reign of flowering plants, however, they\r\nseem to have lived together in the way we are told the beasts first lived\r\nin the garden of Eden.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Tertiary period there were still many tropical\r\nforms, such as Palms, Cycads, _Nipa_, various _Artocarpaceæ_, _Lauraceæ_,\r\n_Araliaceæ_, and others, growing side by side with such temperate forms\r\nas _Quercus_, _Alnus_, _Betula_, _Populus_, _Viburnum_, and others of the\r\nsame kind. Before the middle of the Tertiary was reached the last Cycads\r\ndied in what is now known as Europe; and soon after the middle Tertiary\r\nall the tropical types died out of this zone.\r\n\r\nAt the same time those plants whose leaves appear to have fallen at the\r\nend of the warm season began to become common, which is taken as an\r\nindication of a climatic influence at work. Some writers consider that in\r\nthe Cretaceous times there was no cold season, and therefore no regular\r\nperiod of leaf fall, but as the climate became temperate the deciduous\r\ntrees increased in numbers; yet the Gymnospermic and Angiospermic woods\r\nwhich are found with petrified structure show well-marked annual rings\r\nand seem to contradict this view.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the Tertiary times there were practically no more\r\ntropical forms in the European flora, though there still remained a\r\nnumber of plants which are now found either only in America or only in\r\nAsia.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial epoch at the close of the Tertiary appears to have driven all\r\nthe plants before it, and afterwards, when its glaciers retreated,\r\nshrinking up to the North and up the sides of the high mountains, the\r\nplant species that returned to take possession of the land in the\r\nQuaternary or present period were those which are still inhabiting it,\r\nand the floras of the tropics, Asia, and America were no longer mixed\r\nwith that of Europe.[9]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                         II. Higher Gymnosperms\r\n\r\n\r\nThe more recent history of the higher Gymnosperms, in the Upper\r\nCretaceous and Tertiary periods, much resembles that of the flowering\r\nplants as sketched in the previous chapter. Many of the genera appear to\r\nhave been those still living, and some of the species even may have come\r\nvery close to or have been identical with those of to-day. The forms now\r\ncharacteristic of the different continents were growing together, and\r\nappear to have been widely distributed over the globe. For example,\r\n_Sequoia_ and _Taxodium_, two types now characteristic of America, and\r\n_Glyptostrobus_, at present found in Asia, were still growing with the\r\nother European types in Europe so late as middle Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the Angiosperms, the fossils we have of Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary Gymnosperms are nearly all impressions and casts, though some\r\nmore or less isolated stems have their structure preserved. Hence our\r\nknowledge of these later Gymnosperms is far from complete. From the older\r\nrocks, however, we have both impressions and microscopically preserved\r\nmaterial, and are more fully acquainted with them than with those which\r\nlived nearer our own time. Hard, resistant leaves, which are so\r\ncharacteristic of most of the living genera of Gymnosperms, seem to have\r\nbeen also developed in the past members of the group, and these tend to\r\nleave clear impressions in the rocks, so that we have reliable data for\r\nreconstructing the external appearance of the fossil forms from the\r\nPalæozoic period.\r\n\r\nThe resinous character of Gymnosperm wood probably greatly assisted its\r\npreservation, and fragments of it are very common in rocks of all ages,\r\ngenerally preserved in silica so as to show microscopic structure. The\r\nisolated wood of Gymnosperms, however, is not very instructive, for from\r\nthe wood alone (and usually it is just fragments of the secondary wood\r\nwhich are preserved) but little of either physiological or evolutional\r\nvalue can be learned. When twigs with primary tissues and bark and leaves\r\nattached are preserved, then the specimens are of importance, for their\r\ntrue character can be recognized. Fortunately among the coal balls there\r\nare many such fragments, some of which are accompanied by fruits and male\r\ncones, so that we know much of the Palæozoic Gymnosperms, and find that\r\nin some respects they differ widely from those now living.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, much more to be said about the fossil Gymnosperms\r\nthan about the Angiosperms, both because of the better quality of their\r\npreservation and because their history dates back to a very much earlier\r\nperiod than does the Angiospermic record. Indeed, we do not know when the\r\nGymnosperms began; the well-developed and ancient group of _Cordaiteæ_\r\nwas flourishing before the Carboniferous period, and must therefore date\r\nback to the rocks of which we have no reliable information from this\r\npoint of view, and the origin of the Gymnosperms must lie in the\r\npre-Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nThe group of Gymnosperms includes a number of genera of different types,\r\nmost of which may be arranged under seven principal families. In a sketch\r\nof this nature it is, of course, quite impossible to deal with all the\r\nless-important families and genera. Those that will be considered here\r\nare the following:—\r\n\r\n  Coniferales (see p. 90).\r\n      _Araucareæ_, _e.g._ Monkey-puzzle\r\n          Genera both living and fossil.\r\n          Fossil forms undoubted so far back as the Jurassic, and\r\n                presumably further.\r\n      _Abietineæ_, _e.g._ Pine and Larch\r\n          Genera both living and fossil.\r\n          Fossils recognized as far back as the Lower Cretaceous.\r\n      _Cupresseæ_, _e.g._ Juniper, Cypress\r\n          Genera both living and fossil.\r\n          Fossils recognized as far back as the Jurassic.\r\n      _Taxeæ_, _e.g._ Yew\r\n          Genera living and fossil.\r\n          Fossils recognized as far back as the Cretaceous.\r\n  Cordaitales (see p. 92).\r\n      _Cordaiteæ_, _e.g._ Cordaites\r\n          Fossil only.\r\n          Characteristic of Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian periods.\r\n      _Poroxyleæ_, _e.g._ Poroxylon\r\n          Fossil only.\r\n          Characteristic of the Carboniferous and Permian.\r\n  Ginkgoales (see p. 98).\r\n      _Ginkgoaceæ_, _e.g._ Ginkgo\r\n          Fossil and living, dating back, apparently with little change,\r\n                to Palæozoic times.\r\n\r\nWe must pay the most attention to the two last groups, as they are so\r\nimportant as fossils, and the _Cordaiteæ_ were a very numerous family in\r\nCoal Measure times. They had their period of principal development so\r\nlong ago that it is probable that no direct descendants remain to the\r\npresent time, though some botanists consider that the _Taxeæ_ are allied\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nOf the groups still living it is difficult, almost impossible, to say\r\nwhich is the highest, the most evolved type. In the consideration of the\r\nGymnosperm family it is brought home with great emphasis how incomplete\r\nand partial our knowledge is as yet. Many hold that the _Araucareæ_ are\r\nthe most primitive of the higher Gymnosperms. In support of this view the\r\nfollowing facts are noted. They have a simple type of fructification,\r\nwith a single seed on a simple scale, and many scales arranged round an\r\naxis to form a cone. In the microscopic structure of their wood they have\r\ndouble rows of bordered pits, a kind of wood cell which comes closer to\r\nthe old fossil types than does the wood of any of the other living\r\ngenera. Further than this, wood which is almost indistinguishable from\r\nthe wood of recent Araucarias is found very far back in the rocks, while\r\ntheir leaves are broad and simple, and attached directly to the stem in a\r\nway similar to the leaves of the fossil _Cordaiteæ_, and very different\r\nfrom the needle leaves on the secondary stems of the Pine family; so that\r\nthere appears good ground for considering the group an ancient and\r\nprobably a primitive one.[10]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are not wanting scientists who consider the\r\n_Abietineæ_ the living representatives of the most primitive and ancient\r\nstock, though on the whole the evidence seems to indicate more clearly\r\nthat the Pine-tree group is specialized and highly modified. Their double\r\nseries of foliage leaves, their complex cones (whose structures are not\r\nyet fully understood), and their wood all support the latter view.\r\n\r\nSome, again, consider the _Taxeæ_ as a very primitive group, and would\r\nplace them near the Cordaiteæ, with which they may be related. Their\r\nfleshy seeds, growing not in cones but on short special axes, support\r\nthis view, and it is certainly true that in many ways the large seeds,\r\nwith their succulent coats and big endosperm, are much like those of the\r\nlower Gymnosperms and of several fossil types. Those, however, who hold\r\nto the view that the Abietineæ are primitive, see in the _Taxeæ_ the\r\nlatest and most modified type of Gymnosperm.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from this that there is no lack of variety regarding the\r\ninterpretation of Gymnosperm structures.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosperms do not stand in such an isolated position as do the\r\nAngiosperms. Whatever the variety of views held about the details of the\r\nrelative placing of the families within the group, all agree in\r\nrecognizing the evidence which enables us to trace with confidence the\r\nconnection between the lower Gymnosperms and the families of ferns. There\r\nare many indications of the intimate connection between higher and lower\r\nGymnosperms. Between the series exist what might be described as\r\ndifferent degrees of cousinship, and in the lower groups lie unmistakable\r\nclues to their connection with more ancient groups in the past which\r\nbridge over the gaps between them and the ferns.\r\n\r\nFor the present, however, let us confine ourselves to the history of the\r\nmore important Gymnosperms, the discussion of their origin and the groups\r\nfrom which they may have arisen must be postponed until the necessary\r\ndetails about those groups have been mentioned.\r\n\r\nTo a consideration of the living families of _Araucareæ_, _Abietineæ_,\r\n_Cupresseæ_, and _Taxeæ_ we can allow but a short space; their general\r\ncharacters and appearance are likely to be known to the reader, and their\r\ndetails can be studied from living specimens if they are not. For\r\npurposes of comparison with the fossils, however, it will be necessary to\r\nmention a few of the principal features which are of special importance\r\nin discussing phylogeny.\r\n\r\nThe Araucariaceæ are woody trees which attain a considerable size, with\r\nbroad-based, large leaves attached directly to the stem. In the leaves\r\nare a series of numerous parallel vascular bundles. The wood cells in\r\nmicroscopic section show two rows or more of round bordered pits. The\r\ncones are very large, but the male and female are different in size and\r\norganization. The female cone is composed of series of simple scales\r\narranged spirally round the axis, and each scale bears a single seed and\r\na small ligule.\r\n\r\nThe pollen grains from the male cone are caught on the ligule and the\r\npollen tubes enter the micropyle of the ovule, bringing in passive male\r\ncells which may develop in large numbers in each grain. The seeds when\r\nripe are stony, and some are provided with a wing from part of the tissue\r\nof the scale. In the ripe cones the scales separate from the cone axis.\r\n\r\nThe Abietineæ are woody trees, some reaching a great height, all with a\r\nstrong main stem. The leaves are of two kinds: primary ones borne\r\ndirectly attached to the stem (as in first-year shoots of the Larch), and\r\nsecondary ones borne in tufts of two (in Pine) or a large number (in\r\nolder branches of Larch) on special short branches, the primary leaves\r\nonly developing as brown scales closely attached to the stems. Leaves\r\ngenerally very fine and needlelike, and with a central vascular bundle.\r\nThe wood in microscopic section shows a single row of round bordered pits\r\non the narrow tracheæ.\r\n\r\nThe female cones are large, male and female differing greatly in size and\r\norganization. The female cone, composed of a spiral series of pairs of\r\nscales, which often fuse together as the cone ripens. Each upper scale of\r\nthe pair bears two seeds. The pollen grains from the male cone enter the\r\nmicropyle of the seed and are caught in the tissue (apex of nucellus)\r\nthere; the pollen tubes discharge passive male cells, only two of which\r\ndevelop in each grain. The seeds when ripe are stony and provided with a\r\nwing from the tissue of the scale on which they were borne.\r\n\r\nThe Cupresseæ are woody trees reaching no great height, and of a bushy,\r\nbranching growth. The leaves are attached directly to the main stem, and\r\narrange themselves in alternating pairs of very small leaves, closely\r\npressed to the stem. The wood in microscopic section shows a single row\r\nof round bordered pits on the tracheæ.\r\n\r\nThe cones are small, and the scales forming them arranged in cycles. The\r\nfemale scales bear a varying number of seeds. The pollen grain has two\r\npassive male cells. The seeds when ripe are stony, with wings, though in\r\nsome cases (species of Juniper) the cone scales close up and become\r\nfleshy, so that the whole fruit resembles a berry.\r\n\r\nThe Taxeæ are woody, though not great trees, bushily branched. The leaves\r\nare attached spirally all round the stem, but place themselves so as to\r\nappear to lie in pairs arranged in one horizontal direction. The wood in\r\nmicroscopic section shows a single row of round bordered pits on the\r\ntracheæ.\r\n\r\nThere are small male cones, but the seeds are not borne on cones, growing\r\ninstead on special short axes, where there may be several young ovules,\r\nbut on which usually two seeds ripen. The seeds are big, and have an\r\ninner stone and outer fleshy covering. Some have special outer fleshy\r\nstructures known as “arils”, _e.g._ the red outer cup round the yew\r\n“berry” (which is not a berry at all, but a single unenclosed seed with a\r\nfleshy coat).\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to the Cordaiteæ we come to a group of plants which bears\r\ndistinct relationship to the preceding, but which has a number of\r\nindividual characters. It is a group of which we should know nothing were\r\nit not for the fossils preserved in the Palæozoic rocks; yet,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that it flourished so long ago, it is a family\r\nof which we know much. At the time of the Coal Measures and the\r\nsucceeding Permo-carboniferous period, it was of great importance, and,\r\nindeed, in some of the French deposits it would seem as though whole\r\nlayers of coal were composed entirely of its leaves.\r\n\r\nAmong the fossil remains of this family there are impressions, casts, and\r\ntrue petrifactions, so that we know both its external appearance and the\r\ninternal anatomy of nearly every part of several species of the genus.\r\nFor a long time the various fossil remains of the plant were not\r\nrecognized as belonging to each other and together forming the records of\r\none and the same plant—the broad, long leaves with their parallel veins\r\nwere looked on as Monocotyledons (see fig. 61); the pith casts (see fig.\r\n63) were thought to be peculiar constricted stems, and were called\r\n_Sternbergia_; while the wood, which was known from its microscopic\r\nstructure, was called _Araucarioxylon_—but the careful work of many\r\nmasters of fossil botany, whose laborious studies we cannot describe in\r\ndetail here, brought all these fragments together and proved them to\r\nbelong to _Cordaites_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 61.—Leaf of _Cordaites_, _l_, attached by its broad\r\n  base to a Stem, _s_]\r\n\r\nWe now know that _Cordaites_ were large trees, with strong upright shafts\r\nof wood, to whose branches large simple leaves were attached. The leaves\r\nwere much bigger than those of any living Gymnosperm, even than those of\r\nthe Kauri Pine (a member of the Araucariaceæ), and seem in some species\r\nto have exceeded 3 ft. in length. The trees branched only at the top of\r\nthe main shaft, and with their huge sword-like leaves must have differed\r\ngreatly in appearance from any plant now living. The leaves had many\r\nparallel veins, as can be seen in fig. 61, and were attached by a broad\r\nbase directly to the main stem; thus coming closer to the Araucarias than\r\nthe other groups of Gymnosperms in their leaf characters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 62A.—Microscopic Section of Part of a Leaf of\r\n  _Cordaites_\r\n\r\n  V, Vascular bundle; W, wood of bundle; _sh_, its sheath; S^1, large\r\n  sclerenchyma mass alternating with bundles; S^2 and S^3, sclerenchyma\r\n  caps of bundle; P, soft tissue of leaf.]\r\n\r\nThe internal anatomy is often well preserved, and there is a number of\r\nspecies of leaves whose anatomy is known. As will be expected from the\r\nparallel veins, in each section there are many vascular bundles running\r\nequidistantly through the tissue. Fig. 62A shows the microscopic details\r\nfrom a well-preserved leaf. In all the species patches of sclerenchyma\r\nwere developed, and everything indicates that they were tough and well\r\nprotected against loss of water, even to a greater extent than are most\r\nof the leaves of living Gymnosperms.\r\n\r\nIn the stems the pith was much larger than that in living Gymnosperms\r\n(where the wood is generally very solid), and it was hollow in older\r\nstems, except for discs of tissue across the cavity. The internal cast\r\nfrom these stems has been described before, and is seen in fig. 63.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 62B.—Much-magnified Wood Elements from _Cordaites_\r\n  Stem seen in longitudinal section, the type known as _Araucarioxylon_.\r\n  Note the hexagonal outlines of the bordered pits, which lie in several\r\n  rows]\r\n\r\nThe wood was formed in closely packed radiating rows by a normal cambium\r\n(see p. 66), and the tracheæ so formed had characteristic rows of\r\nbordered pits (see fig. 62B). The wood comes nearer to that of the living\r\nAraucarias than any other, and indeed the numerous pieces of fossil wood\r\nof this type which are known from all the geological periods are called\r\n_Araucarioxylon_.[11] A double strand goes out from the main mass of\r\nwood, which afterwards divides and subdivides to provide the numerous\r\nbundles of the leaf.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 63.—Cast of Hollow Pith of _Cordaites_, the\r\n  constrictions corresponding to discs of solid tissue across the cavity]\r\n\r\nIn the case of these fossils we are fortunate enough to have the\r\nfructifications, both male and female, in a good state of preservation.\r\nAs in other Gymnosperms, the male and female cones are separate, but they\r\ndiffered less from each other in their arrangement than do those of any\r\nof the living types hitherto mentioned. They can hardly be described as\r\ntrue cones, though they had something of that nature; the seeds seem to\r\nbe borne on special short stems, round which are also sterile scales. In\r\nthe seed and the way it is borne perhaps the Cordaiteæ may be compared\r\nmore nearly with the Taxeæ than with the other groups. A seed, not yet\r\nripe, is shown in slightly diagrammatic form in fig. 64, where the\r\nessential details are illustrated. The seeds of this family sometimes\r\nreached a considerable size, and had a fleshy layer which was thick in\r\ncomparison with the stone, and externally comparable with a\r\ncherry—though, of course, of very different nature in reality, for\r\n_Cordaites_, like _Taxus_, is a Gymnosperm, with simple naked seeds,\r\nwhile a cherry is the fruit of an Angiosperm.\r\n\r\nIn a few words, these are the main characters of the large group of\r\n_Cordaites_, which held the dominant position among Gymnosperms in the\r\nPalæozoic era. They have relationships, or perhaps one should say\r\nlikenesses, to many groups. Their stem- and root-anatomy is similar to\r\nthe Coniferæ of the present day, the position of the ovules is like that\r\nin the Taxaceæ, the male cones in some measure recall those of _Ginkgo_,\r\nthe anatomy of their leaves has points which are comparable with those of\r\nthe Cycads, to which group also the large pith in the stem and the\r\nstructure of some details in the seeds unite them. Their own specially\r\ndistinctive characters lie in their crown of huge leaves, and unbranched\r\nshaft of stem, the similarity of their male and female inflorescences,\r\nand some points in their pollen grains which have not been mentioned. The\r\ntype is a very complex one, possibly coming near the stock which, having\r\nbranched out in various directions, gave rise to several of the living\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 64.—Representation of _Cordaites_ Seed and its Axis\r\n  with Scales, slightly diagrammatic, modified from Renault.\r\n\r\n  A, Axis with _s_, scales; _c_, coat of the seed, from which the inner\r\n  parts have shrunk away; _n_, nucellus; _p.c_, pollen chamber containing\r\n  pollen grains which enter through _m_.]\r\n\r\nPlants which come very near to the Cordaiteæ are the Poroxyleæ. Of this\r\ngroup we have unfortunately no remains of fructifications in organic\r\nconnection, so that its actual position must remain a little doubtful\r\ntill they are discovered. There seems no doubt that they must have borne\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nStill, it has been abundantly demonstrated in recent years that the\r\nanatomy of the root, stem, and leaves indicates with considerable\r\nexactness the position of any plant, so that, as these are known, we can\r\ndeduce from them, with a feeling of safety, the position that _Poroxylon_\r\ntakes in the natural system. In its anatomy the characters are those of\r\nthe Cordaiteæ, with certain details which show a more primitive nature\r\nand seem to be characteristic of the groups below it in organization.\r\n\r\n_Poroxylon_ is not common, and until recently had not been found in the\r\nLower Coal Measures of England. The plants appear to have been much\r\nsmaller than _Cordaites_, with delicate stems which bore relatively large\r\nsimple leaves. The anatomy of the root was that common in Gymnosperms,\r\nbut the stem had a very large pith, and the leaves were much like those\r\nof _Cordaites_ in having parallel veins. An important character in the\r\nanatomy of the stem was the presence of what is known as _centripetal\r\nwood_. This must be shortly explained. In all the stems hitherto\r\nconsidered, the first-formed wood cells (protoxylems, see p. 57)\r\ndeveloped at the central point of the wood, towards the pith (see fig.\r\n19, _px_, p. 49). This is characteristic of all Angiosperms and the\r\nhigher Gymnosperms (except in a couple of recently investigated Pines),\r\nbut among the lower plants we find that part of the later wood develops\r\nto the inner side of these protoxylem masses. The distinction is shown in\r\nfig. 65.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 65.—A, Normal bundle of higher plant; _x_,\r\n  protoxylem on inner side next the pith _p_, and the older wood _w_\r\n  outside it, _centrifugal_ wood. B, Bundle with wood cells _c_ developed\r\n  on inner side of protoxylem, _centripetal_ wood; the arrow indicates\r\n  the direction of the centre of the stem.]\r\n\r\nThis point is one to which botanists have given much attention, and on\r\nwhich they have laid much weight in considering the affinities of the\r\nlower Gymnosperms and the intermediate groups between them and the ferns,\r\nwhich are found among the fossils. In _Cordaites_ this point of\r\nconnection with the lower types is not seen, but in _Poroxylon_, which\r\nhas otherwise a stem anatomy very similar to _Cordaites_, we find groups\r\nof _centripetal_ wood developed inside the protoxylem of primary bundles.\r\nFor this reason, principally, is _Poroxylon_ of interest at present, as\r\nin its stem anatomy it seems to connect the _Cordaites_ type with that of\r\nthe group below it in general organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nGinkgoales.—Reference to p. 44 shows that _Ginkgo_, the Maidenhair tree,\r\nbelongs to the Ginkgoales, a group taking equal rank with the large and\r\ncomplex series of the Coniferales. The Ginkgoales of the present day,\r\nhowever, have but one living representative. _Ginkgo_ stands alone, the\r\nsingle living species of its genus, representing a family so different\r\nfrom any other living family that it forms a prime group by itself.\r\n\r\nHad the tree not been held sacred in China and Japan, it is probable that\r\nit would long since have been extinct, for it is now known only in\r\ncultivation. It is indeed a relic from the past which has been\r\nfortunately preserved alive for our examination. It belongs to the fossil\r\nworld, as a belated November rose belongs to the summer.\r\n\r\nBecause of its beauty and interest the plant is now widely distributed\r\nunder cultivation, and is available for study almost as freely as the\r\nother types of living Gymnosperms already mentioned, so that but a short\r\nsummary of its more important features is needed here.\r\n\r\nOld plants, such as can be seen growing freely in Japan (in Kew Gardens\r\nthere is also a fine specimen), are very tall handsome woody trees, with\r\nnoble shafts and many branches. The leaves grow on little side shoots and\r\nare the most characteristic external feature of the tree; their living\r\nform is illustrated in fig. 66, which shows the typical simple shape as\r\nwell as the lobed form of the leaf which are to be found, with all\r\nintermediate stages, on the same tree. No other plant (save a few ferns,\r\nwhich can generally be distinguished from it without difficulty) has\r\nleaves at all like these, so that it is particularly easy to identify the\r\nfossil remains, of which there are many.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 66.—A, Tuft of _Ginkgo_ Leaves, showing their\r\n  “maidenhair”-like shape. B, Single deeply-divided Leaf to be found on\r\n  the same tree, usually on young branches.]\r\n\r\nThe wood is compact and fine grained, the rings of secondary tissue being\r\ndeveloped from a normal cambium as in the case of the higher Gymnosperms,\r\nand the individual tracheæ have round bordered pits. There are small male\r\ncones, but the seeds are not borne in cones. They develop on special\r\nstalks on which are no scales, but a small mass of tissue at the base of\r\nthe seed called the “collar”. Usually there are two young ovules, of\r\nwhich often only one ripens to a fleshy seed, though both may mature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 67.—Ripe Stage of _Ginkgo_ Seeds attached to their\r\n  Stalk. _c_, “Collar” of seed.]\r\n\r\nThe ripe seed reaches the size shown in the diagram, and is orange\r\ncoloured and very fleshy; within it is a stone encasing the endosperm,\r\nwhich is large, _green_, and starchy, and contains the embryo with two\r\ncotyledons. This embryo is small compared with the endosperm, cf. fig.\r\n57, p. 76, which is somewhat similar to that of _Ginkgo_ in this stage.\r\n\r\nOf the microscopic characters of the reproductive organs the most\r\nremarkable is the male cell. This is not a passive nucleus, as in the\r\nplants hitherto considered, but is an _actively swimming_ cell of some\r\nsize, provided with a spiral of cilia (hairlike structures) whose\r\nmovements propel it through the water. In the cavity of the unripe seed\r\nthese swim towards the female cell, and actively penetrate it. The\r\narrangements of the seed are diagrammatically shown in fig. 68, which\r\nshould be compared with that of _Cycas_, fig. 76, with which it has many\r\npoints in common.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 68.—Section through Seed of _Ginkgo_\r\n\r\n  _p.c_, Pollen chamber in the nucellus _n_, which is fused to the coat\r\n  _c_ to the level _l_; _sc_, stony layer in coat; S, the big spore,\r\n  filled with endosperm tissue (in this case green in colour); _e_, egg\r\n  cells, one of which will produce the embryo after fertilization.]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the male cell in _Cordaites_ is not yet known, but there is\r\nreason to suspect it may have been actively swimming also. As this is\r\nuncertain, however, we may consider _Ginkgo_ the most highly organized\r\nplant which has such a primitive feature, a feature which is a bond of\r\nunion between it and the ferns, and which, when it was discovered about a\r\ndozen years ago, caused a considerable sensation in the botanical world.\r\n\r\nTo turn now to the fossil records of this family. Leaf impressions of\r\n_Ginkgo_ are found in rocks of nearly all ages back even to the Upper\r\nPalæozoic. They show a considerable variety of form, and it is certain\r\nthat they do not all belong to the same _species_ as the living plant,\r\nbut probably they are closely allied. Fig. 69 shows a typical impression\r\nfrom the Lower Mesozoic rocks. In this specimen, the cells of the\r\nepidermis were fortunately sufficiently well preserved to be seen with\r\nthe microscope, and there is a distinct difference in the size and shape\r\nof the cells of living and fossil species, see fig. 70; but this\r\ndifference is slight as compared with the great similarity of form and\r\nappearance, as can be seen on comparing figs. 69 and 66, B, so that the\r\nfossil is at the most a different species of the genus _Ginkgo_. Among\r\nthe fossil leaves there is greater variety than among the living ones,\r\nand some which are very deeply lobed so as to form a divided palm-like\r\nleaf go by different names, e.g. _Baiera_, but they are supposed to\r\nbelong to the same family. Fossil seeds and male cones are also known as\r\nimpressions, and are found far back in the Mesozoic rocks. From the\r\nfossil impressions it is certain that _Ginkgo_ and plants closely allied\r\nto it were very widespread in the past, as they are found all over Europe\r\nas well as the other continents. Particularly in the Lower Mesozoic rocks\r\n_Ginkgo_ seems to have been a world-wide type growing in great abundance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 69.—Leaf Impression of _Ginkgo_ from Mesozoic Rocks\r\n  of Scotland]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 70.—Showing Epidermis with Stomates from the lower\r\n  side of the Leaf seen in fig. 69\r\n\r\n  _e_, Epidermis cells; _s_, stomates; _v_, long cells of epidermis lying\r\n  over the veins.]\r\n\r\nIn the Palæozoic the records are not so undoubted, but there is strong\r\nevidence which leads us to suppose that if the genus now living were not\r\nthen extant, at least other closely related genera were, and there seems\r\nto be good grounds for supposing that _Ginkgo_ and _Cordaites_ may have\r\nboth arisen from some ancient common stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                         III. The Bennettitales\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fascinating family is known only from the fossils, and is so remote\r\nin its organization from any common living forms that it may perhaps be a\r\nlittle difficult for those who do not know the Cycads to appreciate the\r\nposition of Bennettites. It would probably be better for one studying\r\nfossil plants for the first time to read the chapters on the Cycads,\r\nPteridosperms, and Ferns before this chapter on the present group, which\r\nhas characters connecting it with that series.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the bulk of the fossils which are found as impressions of\r\nstems and foliage of this family were very naturally classed as Cycads.\r\nThey are extremely common in the Mesozoic rocks (the so-called Age of\r\nCycads), and in the external appearance of both stems and leaves they are\r\npractically identical with the Cycads.\r\n\r\nA few incomplete fructifications of some species have been known in\r\nEurope for many years, but it is only recently that they have been fully\r\nknown. This is owing to Wieland’s[12] work on the American species, which\r\nhas made known the complete organization of the fructifications from a\r\nmass of rich and well-petrified material.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Cretaceous and Upper Jurassic rocks of America these plants\r\nabound, with their microscopic structure well preserved, and their\r\nfructifications show an organization of a different nature from that of\r\nany past or present Cycad.\r\n\r\nProbably owing to their external appearance, Wieland describes the plants\r\nas “Cycads” in the title of his big book on them; but the generic name he\r\nuses, _Cycadeoidea_, seems less known in this country than the equally\r\nwell-established name of _Bennettites_, which has long been used to\r\ndenote the European specimens of this family, and which will be used in\r\nthe following short account of the group.\r\n\r\nAt the present time no family of fossils is exciting more interest. Their\r\ncompletely Cycadean appearance and their unique type of fructification\r\nhave led many botanists to see in them the forerunners of the\r\nAngiosperms, to look on them as the key to that mystery—the origin of the\r\nflowering plants. This position will be discussed and the many facts in\r\nits favour noted, but we must not forget that the _Bennettitales_ have\r\nonly recently been realized fully by botanists, and that a new toy is\r\never particularly charming, a new cure particularly efficacious, and a\r\nnew theory all-persuasive.\r\n\r\nFrom their detailed study of the flowering plants botanists have leaned\r\ntoward different groups as the present representatives of the primitive\r\ntypes. The various claims of the different families to this position\r\ncannot be considered here; probably that of the Ranales (the group of\r\nfamilies round Ranunculaceæ as a central type) is the best supported. Yet\r\nthese plants are most frequently delicate herbs, which would have stood\r\nrelatively less chance of fossilization than the other families which may\r\nbe considered primitive. They are peculiarly remote from the group of\r\nBennettiteæ in their vegetative structure, a fact the importance of which\r\nseems to have been underrated, for in the same breath we are assured that\r\nthe Bennettites are a kind of cousin to the ancient Angiosperms, and that\r\nthe Ranales are among the most primitive living Angiosperms, and\r\ntherefore presumably nearest the ancient ones.\r\n\r\nHowever, let us leave the charms of controversy on one side and look at\r\nthe actual structure of the group. They were widely spread in Lower\r\nMesozoic times, the plants being preserved as casts, impressions, and\r\nwith structure in great numbers. The bulk of the described structural\r\nspecimens have been obtained from the rocks of England, France, Italy,\r\nand America, although leaf impressions are almost universally known. The\r\ngenus _Williamsonia_ belongs to this family, and is one of the best known\r\nof Mesozoic plant impressions.\r\n\r\nExternally the Bennettiteæ were identical in appearance with stumpy\r\nCycads, and their leaves it is which gave rise to the surmise, so long\r\nprevalent, that the Lower Mesozoic was the “Age of Cycads”, just as it\r\nwas the Pteridosperm leaves that gave the Palæozoic the credit of being\r\nthe “Age of Ferns”. In the anatomy of both stem and leaf, also, the\r\ncharacters are entirely Cycadean; the outgoing leaf trace is indeed\r\nsimpler in its course than that of the Cycads.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 71.—Half of a Longitudinal Section through a Mature\r\n  Cone of _Bennettites_\r\n\r\n  A, Short conical axis; _s_, enclosing bracts; S, seeds; _sc_, sterile\r\n  scales between the seeds.]\r\n\r\nThe fructifications, however, differ fundamentally from those of the\r\nCycads, as indeed they do from those of any known family. They took the\r\nform of compact cones, which occurred in very large numbers in the mature\r\nplants hidden by the leaf bases. In _Williamsonia_, of which we know much\r\nless detail, the fructifications stood away from the main axis on long\r\npedicels.\r\n\r\nIn _Bennettites_ the cones were composed of series of sheathing scales\r\nsurrounding a short conical axis on which stood thin radiating stalks,\r\neach bearing a seed. Between them were long-stalked sterile scales with\r\nexpanded ends. A part of a cone is illustrated diagrammatically in fig.\r\n71. The whole had much the appearance of a complex fruit. In some\r\nspecimens these features alone are present in the cones, but in younger\r\ncones from the American plants further structures are found attached.\r\nBelow the main axis of the seed-bearing part of the cone was a series of\r\nlarge complex leaflike structures closely resembling fern leaves in their\r\nmuch-divided nature. On the pinnæ of these leaves were crowded\r\ninnumerable large sporangia, similar to those of a fern, which provided\r\nthe pollen grains. The fossils are particularly well preserved, and have\r\nbeen found with these male (pollen-bearing) organs in the young unopened\r\nstages, and also in the mature unfolded condition, as well as the\r\nripening seed cones from which they have faded, just as the stamens fade\r\nfrom a flower when the seeds enlarge.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 72.—Diagram of Complete Cone of _Bennettites_\r\n\r\n  A, Central axis of conical shape terminating in the seed-bearing cone\r\n  S. (After Wieland), and bearing successively Br., bracts, comparable\r\n  with floral leaves; M, large complex leaves with pollen sacs.]\r\n\r\nIt appears that these huge complex leaflike structures were really\r\nstamens, but nevertheless they were rolled up in the circinate form as\r\nare young fern leaves, and as they unrolled and spread out round the\r\ncentral cone they must have had the appearance of a whorl of leaves (see\r\nfig. 72).\r\n\r\nThis, in a few words, is the main general character of the\r\nfructification. The most important features, on which stress is laid, are\r\nthe following. The association of the male and female structures on the\r\nsame axis, with the female part _above_ the male. This arrangement is\r\nfound only in the flowering plants; the lower plants, which have male and\r\nfemale on the same cone, have them mixed, or the female below, and are in\r\nany case much simpler in their entire organization. The conical form of\r\nthe axis is also important, as is the fact that it terminates in the\r\nseed-bearing structures.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 73.—Diagram of Cross Section of _Bennettites_,\r\n  Seed, with Embryo\r\n\r\n  _c_, Double-layered seed coat; _n_, crushed nucellus; _cot._, two\r\n  cotyledons which practically fill the seed.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the individual seeds, each on the end of a single stalk,\r\nis remarkable, as are the long-stalked bracts whose shield-like ends join\r\nin the protection of the seeds. These structures together give the cone\r\nmuch of the appearance of a complex fruit of a flowering plant, but the\r\nstructure of the seeds themselves is that of a simple Gymnosperm.\r\n\r\nIn the seeds, however, was an _embryo_. In this they differ from all\r\nknown seeds of an earlier date, which, as has been already noted (see p.\r\n77), are always devoid of one. This embryo is one of the most important\r\nfeatures of the plant. It had two cotyledons which filled the seed space\r\n(see fig. 73), and left almost no trace of the endosperm. Reference to p.\r\n112 will show that this is an advance on the Cycad seed, which has a\r\nsmall embryo embedded in a large mass of endosperm, and that it\r\npractically coincides with the Dicotyledonous type.\r\n\r\nThe seed with its embryo suggested comparison with the Angiosperms long\r\nbefore the complete structure of the fructification was known.\r\n\r\nThe fern-like nature of the pollen-bearing structures is another very\r\nimportant point. Were any one of these leaflike “stamens” found isolated\r\nits fern-like nature would not have been questioned a year or two ago,\r\nand their presence in the “flower” of _Bennettites_ is a strong argument\r\nin favour of the Fern-Pteridosperm affinities of the group.\r\n\r\nHad the parts of this remarkable fructification developed on separate\r\ntrees, or on separate branches or distinct cones of the same one, they\r\nwould have been much less suggestive than they are at present, and the\r\nfructifications might well have been included among those of the\r\nGymnosperms, differing little more (apart from the embryo) from the other\r\nGymnosperm genera than they do from each other. In fact, the extremely\r\nfern-like nature of the male organs is almost more suggestive of a\r\nPteridosperm affinity, for even the simplest Cycads have well-marked\r\nscaly cones as their male organs. The female cone, again, considered as\r\nan isolated structure, can be interpreted as being not vitally different\r\nfrom _Cordaites_, where the seeds are borne on special short stalks\r\namidst scales.\r\n\r\nThe embryo would, in any case, point to a position among advanced types;\r\nbut it is so common for one organ of a plant to evolve along lines of its\r\nown independently, or in advance of the other organs, that the embryo\r\nstructure alone could not have been held to counterbalance the Cycadean\r\nstems and leaves, the Pteridosperm-like male organs, and the Gymnospermic\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nBut all these parts occur on the same axis, arranged in the manner\r\ntypical of Angiosperms. The seed-bearing structures at the apex, the\r\n“stamens” below them, and a series of expanded scales below these again,\r\nwhich it takes little imagination to picture as incipient petals and\r\nsepals; and behold—the thing is a flower!\r\n\r\nAnd being a “flower”, is in closest connection with the ancestors of the\r\nmodern flowering plants, which must consequently have evolved from some\r\nCycadean-like ancestor which also gave rise to the Bennettitales. Thus\r\ncan the flowering plants be linked on to the series that runs through the\r\nCycads directly to the primitive ferns!\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this group, of all those known among the fossils,\r\ncomes most closely to an approximation of Angiospermic structure and\r\narrangement. Enough has been said to show that in their actual nature\r\nthey are not Angiosperms, though they have some of their characters,\r\nwhile at the same time they are not Cycads, though they have their\r\nappearance. They stand somewhere between the two. Though many botanists\r\nat present hold that this mixture of characters indicates a relationship\r\nequivalent to a kind of cousinship with the Angiosperms, and both groups\r\nmay be supposed to have originated from a Cycadean stock, this theory has\r\nnot yet stood the test of time, nor is it supported by other evidence\r\nfrom the fossils. We will go so far as to say that it appears as though\r\n_some_ Angiosperms arose in that way; but flowering plants show so many\r\npoints utterly differing from the whole Cycadean stock that a little\r\nscepticism may not be unwholesome.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remember the Lycopods, where (as we shall see, p. 141)\r\nstructures very like seeds were developed at the time when the Lycopods\r\nwere the dominant plants, and we do not find any evidence to prove that\r\nthey led on to the main line of seed plants. Similarly, Cycads may have\r\ngot what practically amounted to flowers at the time when they were the\r\ndominant group, and it is very conceivable that they did not lead on to\r\nthe main line of flowering plants.\r\n\r\nWhatever view may be held, however, and whatever may be the future\r\ndiscoveries relating to this group of plants, we can see in the\r\nBennettitales points which throw much light on the potentialities of the\r\nCycadean stock, and structures which have given rise to some most\r\ninteresting speculations on the subject of the Angiosperms. This group is\r\nanother of the jewels in the crown of fossil botany, for the whole of its\r\nstructures have been reconstructed from the stones that hold all that\r\nremains of this once extensive and now extinct family of plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                             IV. The Cycads\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group of the _Cycadales_, which has a systematic value equivalent to\r\nthe _Ginkgoales_, contains a much larger variety of genera and species\r\nthan does the latter. There are still living nine genera, with more than\r\na hundred and fifty species, which form (though a small one compared with\r\nmost of the prime groups) a well-defined family. They are the most\r\nprimitive Gymnosperms, the most primitive seed-bearing plants now living,\r\nand in their appearance and characters are very different from any other\r\nmodern type. Their external resemblance to the group of the\r\nBennettitales, however, is very striking, and indeed, without the\r\nfructifications it would be impossible to distinguish them.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the genera is that of _Cycas_, of which an illustration\r\nis given in fig. 74. The thick, stumpy stem and crown of “palm”-like\r\nleaves give it a very different appearance from any other Gymnosperm.\r\nCommonly the plants reach only a few feet in height, but very old\r\nspecimens may grow to the height of 30 ft. or more. The other genera are\r\nsmaller, and some have short stems and a very fern-like appearance, as,\r\nfor example, the genus _Stangeria_, which was supposed to be a fern when\r\nit was first discovered and before fruiting specimens had been seen.\r\n\r\nThe large compound leaves are all borne directly on the main stem,\r\ngenerally in a single rosette at its apex, and as they die off they leave\r\ntheir fleshy leaf bases, which cover the stem and remain for an almost\r\nindefinite number of years.\r\n\r\nThe wood of the main trunks differs from that of the other Gymnosperms in\r\nbeing very loosely built, with a large pith and much soft tissue between\r\nthe radiating bands of wood. There is a cambium which adds zones of\r\nsecondary tissue, but it does not do its work regularly, and the cross\r\nsection of an old Cycad stem shows disconnected rings of wood,\r\naccompanied by much soft tissue. The cells of the wood have bordered pits\r\non their walls, and in the main axis the wood is usually all developed in\r\na centrifugal direction, but in the axis of the cones some centripetal\r\nwood is found (refer to _c_, fig. 65, p. 97).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 74.—Plant of _Cycas_, showing the main stem with\r\n  the crown of leaves and the irregular branches which come on an old\r\n  plant]\r\n\r\nIn their fructifications the Cycads stand even further apart from the\r\nrest of the Gymnosperms. One striking point is the enormous size of their\r\n_male_ cones. The male cones consist of a stout axis, round which are\r\nspiral series of closely packed simple scales covered with pollen-bearing\r\nsacs (which bear no inconsiderable likeness to fern sporangia), the whole\r\ncone reaching 1½ ft. in length in some genera, and weighing several\r\npounds. All the other Gymnosperms, except the Araucareæ, where they are\r\nan inch or two long, have male cones but a fraction of an inch in length.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 75.—Seed-bearing Scale of _Cycas_, showing its\r\n  lobed and leaflike character\r\n\r\n  _s_, Seeds attached on either side below the divisions of the\r\n  sporophyll.]\r\n\r\nIn all the members of the family, excepting _Cycas_ itself, the female\r\nfructifications also consist of similarly organized cones bearing a\r\ncouple of seeds on each scale instead of the numerous pollen sacs. In\r\n_Cycas_ the male cones are like those of the other genera, and reach an\r\nenormous size; but there are no female cones, for the seeds are borne on\r\nspecial leaflike scales. These are illustrated in fig. 75, which shows\r\nalso that there are not two seeds (as in the other genera with cones) to\r\neach scale, but an indefinite number.\r\n\r\nThe leafy nature of the seed-bearing scale is an important and\r\ninteresting feature. Although theoretically botanists are accustomed to\r\naccept the view that seeds are always borne on specially modified leaves\r\n(so that to a botanist even the “shell” of a pea-pod and the box of a\r\npoppy capsule are leaves), yet in _Cycas_ alone among living plants are\r\nseeds really found growing on a large structure which has the appearance\r\nof a leaf. Hence, from this point of view (see p. 45, however, for a\r\ncaution against concluding that the whole plant is similarly lowly\r\norganized), _Cycas_ is the most primitive of all the living plants that\r\nbear seeds, and hence presumably the likest to the fossil ancestors of\r\nthe seed-bearing types. In this character it is more primitive than the\r\nfossil group of the _Cordaiteæ_, and comes very close to an intermediate\r\ngroup of fossils to be considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 76.—Seed of _Cycas_ cut open\r\n\r\n  _n_, The nucellus, fused at the level _l_ to the coat _c_; _sc_, stony\r\n  layer of coat; _p.c_, pollen chamber in apex of the nucellus; S,\r\n  “spore”, filled with endosperm, in which lies the embryo _e_.]\r\n\r\nTo enter into the detailed anatomy of the seeds would lead us too far\r\ninto the realms of the specialist, but we must notice one or two points\r\nabout them. Firstly, their very large size, for ripe seeds of _Cycas_ are\r\nas large as peaches (and peaches, it is to be noted, are fruits, not\r\nseeds), and particularly the large size they attain _before_ they are\r\nfertilized and have an embryo. Among the higher plants the young seeds\r\nremain very minute until an embryo is secured by the act of\r\nfertilization, but in the Cycads the seeds enlarge and lay in a big store\r\nof starch in the endosperm before the embryo appears, so that in the\r\ncases in which fertilization is prevented large, sterile “seeds” are\r\nnevertheless produced. This must be looked on as a want of precision in\r\nthe mechanism, and as a wasteful arrangement which is undeniably\r\nprimitive. An even more wasteful arrangement appears to have been common\r\nto the “seeds” of the Palæozoic period, for, though many fossil “seeds”\r\nare known in detail from the old rocks, not one is known to have any\r\ntrace of an embryo. A general plan of the _Cycas_ seed is shown in fig.\r\n76, which should be compared with that of _Ginkgo_ (fig. 68). The large\r\nsize of the endosperm and the thick and complex seed-coats are\r\ncharacteristic features of both these structures. Another point that\r\nmakes the Cycad seeds of special interest is the fact that the male cells\r\n(as in _Ginkgo_) are developed as active, free-swimming sperms, which\r\nswim towards the female cell in the space provided for them in the seed\r\n(see _p.c_, fig. 76).\r\n\r\nThe characters of the Cycads as they are now living prove them to be an\r\nextremely primitive group, and therefore presumably well represented\r\namong the fossils; and indeed among the Mesozoic rocks there is no lack\r\nof impressions which have been described as the leaves of Cycads. There\r\nis, however, very little reliable material, and practically none which\r\nshows good microscopic structure. Leaf impressions alone are most\r\nunsafe—more unsafe in this group, perhaps, than in any other—for reasons\r\nthat will be apparent later on, and the conclusions that used to be drawn\r\nabout the vast number of Cycads which inhabited the globe in the early\r\nMesozoic must be looked on with caution, resulting from the experience of\r\nrecent discoveries proving many of these leaves to belong to a different\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThere remain, however, many authentic specimens which show that _Cycas_\r\ncertainly goes back very far in history, and specimens of this genus are\r\nknown from the older Mesozoic rocks. We cannot say, however, as securely\r\nas used to be said, that the Mesozoic was the “Age of Cycads”, although\r\nit was doubtless the age of plants which had much of the external\r\nappearance of Cycads.\r\n\r\nFrom the Palæozoic we have no reliable evidence of the existence of\r\nCycads, though the plants of that time included a group which has an\r\nundoubted connection with them.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so far as fossil evidence goes, we must suppose that the Cycads,\r\nsince their appearance, possibly at the close of the Palæozoic, have\r\nnever been a dominant or very extensive family, though they grew in the\r\npast all over the world, and in Europe seem to have remained till the\r\nmiddle of the Tertiary epoch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                            V. Pteridosperms\r\n\r\n\r\nThis group consists entirely of plants which are extinct, and which were\r\nin the height of their development in the Coal Measure period. As a group\r\nthey are the most recently discovered in the plant world, and but a few\r\nyears ago the name “Pteridosperm” was unknown. They form, however, both\r\none of the most interesting of plant families and one of the most\r\nnumerous of those which flourished in the Carboniferous period.\r\n\r\nTo mention first the vital point of interest in their structure, they\r\nshow _leaves which in all respects appear like ordinary foliage leaves,\r\nand yet bear seeds_. These leaves, which we now know bore the seeds, had\r\nlong been considered as typical fern leaves, and had been named and\r\ndescribed as fern leaves. There are two extremely important results from\r\nthe discovery of this fossil group, viz. that leaves, to all appearance\r\nlike ordinary foliage, can directly bear seeds, and that the leaves,\r\nthough like fern leaves, bore seeds like those of a Cycad.\r\n\r\nAs the name _Pteridosperm_ indicates, the group is a link between the\r\nferns and the seed-bearing plants, and as such is of special interest and\r\nvalue to botanists.\r\n\r\nThe gradual recognition of this group from among the numerous plant\r\nfragments of Palæozoic age is one of the most interesting of the\r\naccumulative discoveries of fossil botany. Ever since fossil remains\r\nattracted the attention of enquiring minds many “ferns” have been\r\nrecognized among the rich impressions of the Coal Measures. Most of them,\r\nhowever, were not connected with any structural material, and were given\r\nmany different names of specific value. So numerous were these fern\r\n“species” that it was supposed that in the Coal Measure period the ferns\r\nmust have been the dominant class, and it is often spoken of even yet as\r\nthe “Age of Ferns”. From the rocks of the same age, preserved with their\r\nmicroscopical structure perfect, were stems which were called\r\n_Lyginodendron_. In the coal balls associated with these stems (which\r\nwere the commonest of the stems so preserved) were also roots, petioles,\r\nand leaflets, but they were isolated, like the most of the fragments in a\r\ncoal ball, and to each was given its name, with no thought of the various\r\nfragments having any connection with each other. Gradually, however,\r\nvarious fragments from the coal balls had been recognized as belonging\r\ntogether; one specimen of a petiole attached to a stem sufficed to prove\r\nthat all the scattered petioles of the same type belonged also to that\r\nkind of stem, and when leaves were found attached to an isolated fragment\r\nof the petiole, the chain of proof was complete that the leaves belonged\r\nto the stem, and so on. By a series of lengthy and painstaking\r\ninvestigations all the parts of the plant now called _Lyginodendron_ have\r\nbeen brought together, and the impressions of its leaves have been\r\nconnected with it, these being of the fernlike type so long called\r\n_Sphenopteris_, illustrated in fig. 77.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 77.—_Sphenopteris_ Leaf Impression, the fernlike\r\n  foliage of _Lyginodendron_]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 78A.—Diagram of the Transverse Section of Stem of\r\n  the _Lyginodendron_\r\n\r\n  _p_, Pith; P, primary wood groups; W, secondary wood; _l.t_, leaf\r\n  trace; _s_, sclerized bands in the cortex; S, longitudinal view of wood\r\n  elements to show the rows of bordered pits.]\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of the main stem is very suggestive of that of a Cycad. The\r\nzones of secondary wood are loosely built, the quantity of soft tissue\r\nbetween the radiating bands of wood, and the size of the pith being\r\nlarge, while from the main axis double strands of wood run out to the\r\nleaf base. The primary bundles, however, are not like those of a Cycad\r\nstem, but have groups of _centripetal_ wood within the protoxylem, and\r\nthus resemble the primary bundles of _Poroxylon_ (see p. 97), which are\r\nmore primitive in this respect than those of the Cycads.\r\n\r\nThe roots of _Lyginodendron_, when young, were like those of the\r\nMarattiaceous ferns, their five-rayed mass of wood being characteristic\r\nof that family, and different from the type of root found in most other\r\nferns (cf. fig. 78B with fig. 35 on p. 60). Unlike fern roots of any\r\nkind, however, they have well-developed zones of secondary wood, in which\r\nthey approach the Gymnospermic roots (see fig. 78B, _s_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 78B.—Transverse Section of Root of _Lyginodendron_\r\n\r\n  _w_, Five-rayed mass of primary wood; _s_, zone of secondary wood; _c_,\r\n  cortical and other soft tissues.]\r\n\r\nA further mixture of characters is seen in the vascular bundles of the\r\npetioles. A double strand, like that in the lower Gymnosperms, goes off\r\nto the leaf base from the main axis, but in the petiole itself the bundle\r\nis like a normal fern stele, and shows no characters in transverse\r\nsection which would separate it from the ferns. Such a petiole is\r\nillustrated in fig. 79, with its V-shaped fernlike stele. On the petioles\r\nand stems were certain rough, spiny structures of the nature of complex\r\nhairs. In some cases they are glandular, as is seen in _g_ in fig. 79,\r\nand as they seem to be unique in their appearance they have been of great\r\nservice in the identification of the various isolated organs of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nAs is seen from fig. 77, the leaves were quite fern-like, but in\r\nstructural specimens they have been found with the characteristic\r\nglandular hairs of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe seeds were so long known under the name of _Lagenostoma_ that they\r\nare still called by it, though they have been identified as belonging to\r\n_Lyginodendron_. They were small (about ¼ in. in maximum length) when\r\ncompared with those of most other plants of the group, or of the Cycads,\r\nwith which they show considerable affinity. They are too complex to\r\ndescribe fully, and have been mentioned already (see p. 76), so that they\r\nwill not be described in much detail here. The diagrammatic figure (fig.\r\n56) shows the essential characters of their longitudinal section, and\r\ntheir transverse section, as illustrated in fig. 80, shows the complex\r\nand elaborate mechanism of the apex.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 79.—Transverse Section through Petiole of\r\n  _Lyginodendron_\r\n\r\n  _v_, Fern-like stele; _c_, cortex; _g_, glandular hairlike\r\n  protuberances.]\r\n\r\nRound the “seed” was a sheath, something like the husk round a hazel nut,\r\nwhich appears to have had the function of a protective organ, though what\r\nits real morphological nature may have been is as yet an unsolved\r\nproblem. On the sheath were glandular hairs like those found on the\r\npetiole and leaves, which were, indeed, the first clues that led to the\r\ndiscovery of the connection between the seed and the plant\r\n_Lyginodendron_.\r\n\r\nThe pollen grains seem to have been produced in sacs very like fern\r\nsporangia developed on normal foliage leaves, each grain entered the\r\ncavity _pc_ in the seed (see fig. 56), but of the nature of the male cell\r\nwe are ignorant. In none of the fossils has any embryo been found in the\r\n“seeds”, so that presumably they ripened, or at least matured their\r\ntissues, before fertilization.\r\n\r\nThese, in a few words, are the essentials of the structures of\r\n_Lyginodendron_. But this plant is only one of a group, and at least two\r\nother of the Pteridosperms deserve notice, viz. _Medullosa_, which is\r\nmore complex, and _Heterangium_, which is simpler than the central type.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 80.—Diagram of Transverse Section of _Lagenostoma_\r\n  Seed near the Apex, showing the nine flutings _f_ of the coat _c_; _v_,\r\n  the vascular strand in each; _nc_, cone of nucellar tissue standing up\r\n  in the fluted apex of the nucellus _n_; _pc_, the pollen chamber with a\r\n  few pollen grains; _s_, space between nucellus and coat. Compare with\r\n  diagram 56.]\r\n\r\n_Heterangium_ is found also in rocks rather older than the coal series of\r\nEngland, though of Carboniferous age, viz. in the Calciferous sandstone\r\nseries of Scotland, it occurs also in the ordinary Coal Measure nodules.\r\nIt is in several respects more primitive than _Lyginodendron_, and in\r\nparticular in the structure of its stele comes nearer to that of ferns.\r\nThe stele is, in fact, a solid mass of primary wood and wood parenchyma,\r\ncorresponding in some degree to the protostele of a simple type (see p.\r\n61, fig. 36), but it has towards the outside groups of protoxylem\r\nsurrounded by wood in both centripetal and centrifugal directions, which\r\nare just like the primary bundles in _Lyginodendron_. Outside the primary\r\nmass of wood is a zone of secondary wood, but the quantity is not large\r\nin proportion to it (see fig. 81), as is common in Lyginodendron.\r\n\r\nThough the primary mass is so fernlike in appearance the larger tracheids\r\nshow series of bordered pits, as do most of the tracheids of the\r\nPteridosperms, in which they show a Gymnosperm-like character.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 81.—_Heterangium_\r\n\r\n  A, Half of the stele of a stem, showing the central mass of wood S\r\n  mixed with parenchyma _p_. The protoxylem groups _p. x._ lie towards\r\n  the outside of the stele. Surrounding it is the narrow zone of\r\n  small-celled secondary wood W. B, A few of the wood cells in\r\n  longitudinal view: _p. x._, Protoxylem; _p_, parenchyma. S, Large\r\n  vessels with rows of bordered pits.]\r\n\r\nThe foliage of _Heterangium_ was fernlike, with much-divided leaves\r\nsimilar to those of _Lyginodendron_. We have reason to suspect, though\r\nactual proof is wanting as yet, that small Gymnosperm-like seeds were\r\nborne directly on these leaves.\r\n\r\n_Medullosa_ has been mentioned already (see p. 72) because of the\r\ninteresting and unusually complex type of its vascular anatomy. Each\r\nindividual stele of the group of three in the stem, however, is\r\nessentially similar to the stele of a Heterangium.\r\n\r\nThough the whole arrangement appears to differ so widely from other stems\r\nin the plant world, careful comparison with young stages of recent Cycads\r\nhas indicated a possible remote connection with that group, while in the\r\nprimary arrangements of the protosteles a likeness may be traced to the\r\nferns. The roots, even in their primary tissues, were like those of\r\nGymnosperms, but the foliage with its compound leaves was quite fern-like\r\nexternally. A small part of a leaf is shown in fig. 83, and is clearly\r\nlike a fern in superficial appearance. The leaves were large, and the\r\nleaf bases strong and well supplied with very numerous branching vascular\r\nbundles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 82.—Steles of _Medullosa_ in Cross Section of the\r\n  Stem\r\n\r\n  A, Primary solid wood; S, surrounding secondary wood.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 83.—Part of a Leaf of _Medullosa_, known as\r\n  _Alethopteris_, for long supposed to be a Fern]\r\n\r\nThe connection between this plant and certain large three-ribbed seeds\r\nknown as _Trigonocarpus_ is strongly suspected, though actual continuity\r\nis not yet established in any of the specimens hitherto discovered. These\r\nseeds have been mentioned before (p. 76 and p. 82). They were larger than\r\nthe other fossil seeds which we have mentioned, and, with their fleshy\r\ncoat, were similar in general organization to the Cycads, though the fact\r\nthat the seed coat stood free from the inner tissues right down to the\r\nbase seems to mark them as being more primitive (cf. fig. 55, p. 76).\r\n\r\nOf impressions of the Pteridosperms the most striking is, perhaps, the\r\nfoliage known as _Neuropteris_ (see fig. 6, p. 13), to which the large\r\nseeds are found actually attached (cf. fig. 85).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 84.—Diagrammatic Section of a Transverse Section of\r\n  a Seed of _Trigonocarpus_\r\n\r\n  S, Stone of coat with three main ridges and six minor ones. F, Flesh of\r\n  coat: _i f_, inner flesh; _n_, nucellus, crushed and free from coat;\r\n  _s_, spore wall.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 85.—Fragment of Foliage of _Neuropteris_ with Seed\r\n  attached, showing the manner in which the seeds grew on the normal\r\n  foliage leaves in the Pteridosperms]\r\n\r\nEver-increasing numbers of the “ferns” are being recognized as belonging\r\nto the Pteridosperms, but _Heterangium_, _Lyginodendron_, and _Medullosa_\r\nform the three principal genera, and are in themselves a series\r\nindicating the connection between the fernlike and Cycadean characters.\r\n\r\nBefore the fructifications were suspected of being seeds the anatomy of\r\nthese plants was known, and their nature was partly recognized from it\r\nalone, though at that time they were supposed to have only fernlike\r\nspores.\r\n\r\nThe very numerous impressions of their fernlike foliage from the\r\nPalæozoic rocks indicate that the plants which bore such leaves must have\r\nexisted at that time in great quantity. They must have been, in fact, one\r\nof the dominant types of the vegetation of the period. The recent\r\ndiscovery that so large a proportion of them were not ferns, but were\r\nseed-bearing plants, alters the long-established belief that the ferns\r\nreached their high-water mark of prosperity in the Coal Measure period.\r\nIndeed, the fossils of this age which remain undoubtedly true ferns are\r\nfar from numerous. It is the seed-bearing Pteridosperms which had their\r\nday in Palæozoic times. Whether they led directly on to the Cycads is as\r\nyet uncertain, the probability being rather that they and the Cycads\r\nsprang from a common stock which had in some measure the tendencies of\r\nboth groups.\r\n\r\nThat the Pteridosperms in themselves combined many of the most important\r\nfeatures of both Ferns and Gymnosperms is illustrated in the account of\r\nthem given above, which may be summarized as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                Salient Characters of the Pteridosperms\r\n                          _G_=_Gymnospermic_     _F_=_Fernlike_\r\n\r\n  _F_    Primary structure of root.\r\n  _G_    Secondary thickening of root.\r\n  _F_    In _Heterangium_ and _Medullosa_ the\r\n  _F_    solid centripetal primary wood of stele.\r\n  _G_    Pits on tracheæ of primary wood.\r\n  _G_    Secondary thickening of stem.\r\n  _G_    Double leaf trace.\r\n  _F_    Fernlike stele in petiole.\r\n  _F_    Fernlike leaves.\r\n  _F_    Sporangia pollen-sac-like.\r\n  _F_    Reproductive organs borne directly on ordinary foliage leaves.\r\n  _G_    General organization of the seed.\r\n\r\nThus it can be seen at a glance, without entering into minutiæ, that the\r\ncharacters are divided between the two groups with approximate equality.\r\nThe connection with Ferns is clear, and the connection with Gymnosperms\r\nis clear. The point which is not yet determined, and about which\r\ndiscussion will probably long rage, is the position of this group in the\r\nwhole scheme of the plant world. Do they stand as a connecting link\r\nbetween the ferns on one hand and the whole train of higher plants on the\r\nother, or do they lead so far as the Cycads and there stop?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                             VI. The Ferns\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the records in the rocks do not go back so far as to touch\r\nwhat must have been the most interesting period in the history of the\r\nferns, namely, the point where they diverged from some simple ancestral\r\ntype, or at least were sufficiently primitive to give indications of\r\ntheir origin from some lower group.\r\n\r\nBefore the Devonian period all plant impressions are of little value, and\r\nby that early pre-Carboniferous time there are preserved complex leaves,\r\nwhich are to all appearance highly organized ferns.\r\n\r\nTo-day the dominant family in this group is the _Polypodiaceæ_. It\r\nincludes nearly all our British ferns, and the majority of species for\r\nthe whole world. This family does not appear to be very old, however, and\r\nit cannot be recognized with certainty beyond Mesozoic times.\r\n\r\nFrom the later Mesozoic we have only material in the form of impressions,\r\nfrom which it is impossible to draw accurate conclusions unless the\r\nspecimens have sporangia attached to them, and this is not often the\r\ncase. The cuticle of the epidermis or the spores can sometimes be studied\r\nunder the microscope after special treatment, but on the whole we have\r\nvery little information about the later Mesozoic ferns.\r\n\r\nA couple of specimens from the older Mesozoic have been recently\r\ndescribed, with well-preserved structure, and they belong to the family\r\nof the Osmundas (the so-called “flowering ferns”, because of the\r\nappearance of special leaves on which all the sporangia are crowded), and\r\nshow in the anatomical characters of their stems indications that they\r\nmay be related to an old group, the _Botryopterideæ_, in which are the\r\nmost important of the Palæozoic ferns.\r\n\r\nIn the Palæozoic rocks there are numerous impressions as well as fern\r\npetrifactions, but in the majority of cases the connection between the\r\ntwo is not yet established. There were two main series of ferns, which\r\nmay be classed as belonging to\r\n\r\n  I. Marattiaceæ.\r\n  II. Botryopterideæ.\r\n\r\nOf these the former has still living representatives, though the group is\r\nsmall and unimportant compared with what it once was; the latter is\r\nentirely extinct, and is chiefly developed in the Carboniferous and\r\nsucceeding Permian periods.\r\n\r\nThe latter group is also the more interesting, for its members show great\r\nvariety, and series may be made of them which seem to indicate the course\r\ntaken in the advance towards the Pteridosperm type. For this reason the\r\ngroup will be considered first, while the structure of the Pteridosperms\r\nis still fresh in our minds.\r\n\r\nThe Botryopterideæ formed an extensive and elaborate family, with its\r\nnumerous members of different degrees of complexity. There is,\r\nunfortunately, but little known as to their external appearance, and\r\nalmost no definite information about their foliage. They are principally\r\nknown by the anatomy of their stems and petioles. Some of them had\r\nupright trunks like small tree ferns (living tree ferns belong to quite a\r\ndifferent family, however), others appear to have had underground stems,\r\nand many were slender climbers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 86.—Stele of _Asterochlaena_, showing its deeply\r\n  lobed nature]\r\n\r\nIn their anatomy all the members of the family have monostelic structure\r\n(see p. 62). This is noteworthy, for at the present time though a number\r\nof genera are monostelic, no family whose members reach any considerable\r\nsize or steady growth is exclusively monostelic. In the shape of the\r\nsingle stele, there is much variety in the different genera, some having\r\nit so deeply lobed that only a careful examination enables one to\r\nrecognize its essentially monostelic nature. In fig. 86 a radiating\r\nstar-shaped type is illustrated. Between this elaborate type of\r\nprotostele in _Asterochlaena_, and the simple solid circular mass seen in\r\n_Botryopteris_ itself (fig. 88) are all possible gradations of structure.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 87.—The Stele of a Botryopteridean Stem, showing\r\n  soft tissue in the centre of the solid wood of the protostele.\r\n  (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nIn several of the genera the centre of the wood is not entirely solid,\r\nbut has cells of soft tissue, an incipient pith, mixed with scattered\r\ntracheids, as in fig. 87.\r\n\r\nIn most of the genera numerous petioles are given off from the main axis,\r\nand these are often of a large size compared with it, and may sometimes\r\nbe thicker than the axis itself. Together with the petiole usually come\r\noff adventitious roots, as is seen in fig. 88, which shows the main axis\r\nof a _Botryopteris_. The petioles of the group show much variety in their\r\nstructure, and some are extremely complex. A few of the shapes assumed by\r\nthe steles of the petioles are seen in fig. 89; they are not divided into\r\nseparate bundles in any of the known forms, as are many of the petiole\r\nsteles of other families.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 88.—Main Axis of _Botryopteris_ with simple solid\r\n  Protostele _x_. A petiole about to detach itself _p_ and the strand\r\n  going out to an adventitious root _r_ are also seen.\r\n  (Micro-photograph.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 89.—Diagrams showing the Shapes of the Steles in\r\n  some of the Petioles of different Genera of Botryopterideæ\r\n\r\n  A, _Zygopteris_; B, _Botryopteris_; C, _Tubicaulis_; D,\r\n  _Asterochlaena_.]\r\n\r\nIn one genus of the family secondary wood has been observed. This is\r\nhighly suggestive of the condition of the stele in _Heterangium_, where\r\nthe large mass of the primary wood is surrounded by a relatively small\r\nquantity of secondary thickening, developed in normal radial rows from a\r\ncambium.\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy point in the wood of these plants is the thickening of\r\nthe walls of the wood cells. Many of them have several rows of bordered\r\npits, and are, individually, practically indistinguishable from those of\r\nthe Pteridosperms, cf. fig. 81 and fig. 90. These are unlike the\r\ncharacteristic wood cells of modern ferns and of the other family of\r\nPalæozoic ferns.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of most members of the family is unknown, or at least, of the\r\nmany impressions which possibly belong to the different genera, the most\r\npart have not yet been connected with their corresponding structural\r\nmaterial. There are indications, however, that the leaves were large and\r\ncomplexly divided.\r\n\r\nThe fructifications were presumably fern sporangia of normal but rather\r\nmassive type. Of most genera they are not known, though in a few they\r\nhave been found in connection with recognizable parts of their tissue.\r\nThe best known of the sporangia are large, in comparison with living\r\nsporangia (actually about 2.5 millimetres long), oval sacs clustered\r\ntogether on little pedicels. The spores within them seem in no way\r\nessentially different from normal fern spores.\r\n\r\nThe coexistence of the Botryopterideæ and Pteridosperms, and the several\r\npoints in the structure of the former which seem to lead up to the\r\ncharacters of the latter group, are significant. The Botryopterideæ, even\r\nwere they an entirely isolated group, would be interesting from the\r\nvariety of structures and the variations of the monostele in their\r\nanatomy; and the prominent place they held in the Palæozoic flora, as the\r\ngreatest family of ferns of that period, gives them an important position\r\nin fossil botany.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 90.—Tracheæ of Wood of Botryopteridean Fern in\r\n  Longitudinal Section, showing the rows of pits on the walls.\r\n  (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nThe other family of importance in Palæozoic times, the Marattiaceæ, has\r\ndescendants living at the present day, though the family is now\r\nrepresented by a small number of species belonging to but five genera\r\nwhich are confined to the tropics. Perhaps the best known of these is the\r\ngiant “Elephant Fern”, which sends up from its underground stock huge\r\ncomplex fronds ten or a dozen feet high. Other species are of the more\r\nusual size and appearance of ferns, while some have sturdy trunks\r\nabove-ground supporting a crown of leaves. The members of this family\r\nhave a very complex anatomy, with several series of steles of large size\r\nand irregular shape. Their fructifications are characteristic, the\r\nsporangia being placed in groups of about five to a dozen, and fused\r\ntogether instead of ripening as separate sacs as in the other fern\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\nImpressions of leaves with this type of sorus (group of fern sporangia)\r\nare found in the Mesozoic rocks, and these bridge over the interval\r\nbetween the living members of the family and those which lived in\r\nPalæozoic times.\r\n\r\nIn the Coal Measure and Permian periods these plants flourished greatly,\r\nand there are remains of very numerous species from that time. The family\r\nwas much more extensive then than it is now, and the individual members\r\nalso seem to have reached much greater dimensions, for many of them had\r\nthe habit of large tree ferns with massive trunks. Up till Triassic times\r\nhalf of the ferns appear to have belonged to this family; since then,\r\nhowever, they seem to have dwindled gradually down to the few genera now\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent fossils of this type with well-preserved structure have\r\nlong been known to the general public, as their anatomy gave the stones a\r\nvery beautiful appearance when polished, so that they were used for\r\ndecorative purposes by lapidaries before their scientific interest was\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Palæozoic Marattiaceæ which have structure preserved\r\ngenerally go by the generic name _Psaronius_, in which there is a great\r\nnumber of species. They show considerable uniformity in their essential\r\nstructure (in which they differ noticeably from the group of ferns just\r\ndescribed), so that but one type will be considered.\r\n\r\nIn external appearance they probably resembled the “tree ferns” of the\r\npresent day (though these belong to an entirely different family), with\r\nmassive stumps, some of which reached a height of 60 ft. The large\r\nspreading leaves were arranged in various ways on the stem, some in a\r\ndouble row along it, as is seen by the impressions of the leaf scars, and\r\nothers in complex spirals. On the leaves were the spore sacs, which were\r\nin groups, some completely fused like those of the modern members of the\r\nfamily, and others with independent sporangia massed in well-defined\r\ngroups. In their microscopic structure also they appear to have been\r\nclosely similar to those of the living Marattiaceæ.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section of a stem shows the most characteristic and\r\nbest-known view of the plant. This is shown in fig. 91, in somewhat\r\ndiagrammatic form.\r\n\r\nThe mass of rootlets which entirely permeate and surround the outer\r\ntissues of the stem is a very striking and characteristic feature of all\r\nthe species of _Psaronius_. Though such a mass of roots is not found in\r\nthe living species, yet the microscopic structure of an individual fossil\r\nroot is almost identical with that of a living _Marattia_.\r\n\r\nThough these plants were so successful and so important in Palæozoic\r\ntimes, the group even then seems to have possessed little variety and\r\nlittle potentiality for advance in new directions. They stand apart from\r\nthe other fossils, and the few forms which now compose the living\r\nMarattiaceæ are isolated from the present successful types of modern\r\nferns. From the _Psaronieæ_ we can trace no development towards a modern\r\nseries of plants, no connection with another important group in the past.\r\nThey appear to have culminated in the later Palæozoic and to have slowly\r\ndwindled ever since. It has been suggested that the male fructifications\r\nof the Bennettiteæ and the Pteridosperms show some likeness to the\r\nMarattiaceæ, but there does not seem much to support any view of\r\nphylogenetic connection between them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 91.—Transverse Section of Stem of _Psaronius_\r\n\r\n  _v_, Numerous irregularly-shaped steles; _s_, irregular patches of\r\n  sclerenchyma; _l_, leaf trace going out as a horseshoe-shaped stele;\r\n  _c_, zone of cortex with numerous adventitious roots _r_ running\r\n  through it; _sc_, sclerized cortical zone of roots; _w_, vascular\r\n  strand of roots.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the palæozoic ferns, mention should be made of the very\r\nnumerous leaf impressions which seem to show true fern characters, though\r\nthey have not been connected with material showing their internal\r\nstructure. Among them it is rare to get impressions with the _sori_ or\r\nsporangia, but such are known and are in themselves enough to prove the\r\ncontention that true ferns existed in the Palæozoic epoch. For it might\r\nbe mentioned as a scientific curiosity, that after the discovery that so\r\nmany of the leaf impressions which had always been supposed to be ferns,\r\nreally belonged to the seed-bearing Pteridosperms, there was a period of\r\npanic among some botanists, who brought forward the startling idea that\r\nthere were _no_ ferns at all in the Palæozoic periods, and that modern\r\nferns were degenerated seed-bearing plants!\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 92.—Impression of Palæozoic Fern, showing _sori_ on\r\n  the pinnules. (Photo.)]\r\n\r\nThese two big groups from the Palæozoic include practically all the ferns\r\nthat then flourished. They have been spoken of (together with a few other\r\ntypes of which little is known) as the _Primofilices_, a name which\r\nemphasizes their primitive characters. As can be seen by the complex\r\norganization of the genera, however, they themselves had advanced far\r\nbeyond their really primitive ancestors. There is clear indication that\r\nthe Botryopterideæ were in a period of change, what might almost be\r\ntermed a condition of flux, and that from their central types various\r\nfamilies separated and specialized. Behind the Botryopterideæ, however,\r\nwe have no specimens to show us the connection between them and the\r\nsimpler groups from which they must have sprung. From a detailed\r\ncomparative study of plant anatomy we can deduce some of the essential\r\ncharacters of such ancestral plants, but here the realm of fossil botany\r\nceases, to give place to theoretical speculation. As a fact, there is a\r\ndeep abyss between the ferns and the other families of the Pteridophytes,\r\nwhich is not yet bridged firmly enough for any but specialists, used to\r\nthe hazardous footing on such structures, to attempt to cross it. Until\r\nthe buttresses and pillars of the bridge are built of the strong stone of\r\nfossil structures we must beware of setting out on what would prove a\r\nperilous journey.\r\n\r\nIn the Coal Measures and previous periods we see the ferns already\r\nrepresented by two large families, differing greatly from each other, and\r\nfrom the main families of modern ferns which sprung at a later date from\r\nsome stock which we have not yet recognized. But though their past is so\r\nobscure, the palæozoic ferns and their allies throw a brilliant light on\r\nthe course of evolution of the higher groups of plants, and the gulf\r\nbetween ferns and seed-bearing types may be said to be securely bridged\r\nby the Botryopterideæ and the Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                           VII. The Lycopods\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present-day members of this family are not at all impressive, and in\r\ntheir lowliness may well be overlooked by one who is not interested in\r\nunpretending plants. The fresh green mosslike _Selaginella_ grown by\r\nflorists as ornamental borders in greenhouses and the creeping “club\r\nmoss” twining among the heather on a Highland moor are probably the best\r\nknown of the living representatives of the Lycopods. In the past the\r\ngroup held a very different position, and in the distant era of the Coal\r\nMeasures it held a dominant one. Many of the giants of the forest\r\nbelonged to the family (see frontispiece), and the number of species it\r\ncontained was very great.\r\n\r\nLet us turn at once to this halcyon period of the group. The history of\r\nthe times intervening between it and the present is but the tale of the\r\ndying out of the large species, and the gradual shrinking of the family\r\nand dwarfing of its representative genera.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give the characters of a scientific family in a few\r\nsimple words; but perhaps we may describe the living Lycopods as plants\r\nwith creeping stems which divide and subdivide into two with great\r\nregularity, and which bear large numbers of very small pointed leaves\r\nclosely arranged round the stem. The fruiting organs come at the tips of\r\nthe branches, and sometimes themselves divide into two, and in these\r\ncone-like axes the spore cases are arranged, a single one on the upper\r\nside of each of the scales (see p. 67, fig. 46, A). In the Lycopods the\r\nspores are all alike, in the Selaginellas there are larger spores borne\r\nin a small number (four) in some sporangia (see fig. 53, p. 75), and\r\nothers in large numbers and of smaller size on the scales above them. The\r\nstems are all very slender, and have no zones of secondary wood. They\r\ngenerally creep or climb, and from them are put out long structures\r\nsomething like roots in appearance, which are specially modified\r\nstem-like organs giving rise to roots.\r\n\r\nFrom the fossils of the Coal Measures _Lepidodendron_ must be chosen as\r\nthe example for comparison. The different species of this genus are very\r\nnumerous, and the various fossilized remains of it are among the\r\ncommonest and best known of palæontological specimens. The huge stems are\r\nobjects of public interest, and have been preserved in the Victoria Park\r\nin Glasgow in their original position in the rocks, apparently as they\r\ngrew with their spreading rootlike organs running horizontally. A great\r\nstump is also preserved in the Manchester Museum, and is figured in the\r\nfrontispiece. While among the casts and impressions the leaf bases of the\r\nplant are among the best preserved and the most beautiful (see fig. 93).\r\nThe cone has already been illustrated (see fig. 46 and fig. 9), and is\r\none of the best known of fossil fructifications.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 93.—Photo of Leaf Bases of _Lepidodendron_\r\n\r\n  C, Scar of leaf; S, leaf base. In the scar: _v_, mark of severed\r\n  vascular bundle, and _p_, of parichnos. _l_, Ligule scar.]\r\n\r\nFrom the abundant, though scattered material, fossil botanists have\r\nreconstructed the plants in all their detail. The trunks were lofty and\r\nof great thickness, bearing towards the apex a much-branched crown, the\r\nbranches, even down to the finest twigs, all dividing into two equal\r\nparts. The leaves, as would be expected from the great size of the\r\nplants, were much bigger than those of the recent species (fig. 93 shows\r\nthe actual size of the leaf bases), but they were of the same\r\n_relatively_ small size as compared with the stems, and of the same\r\nsimple pointed shape. A transverse section across the apex of a fertile\r\nbranch shows these closely packed leaves arranged in series round the\r\naxis, those towards the outside show the central vascular strand which\r\nruns through each.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 94.—Section across an Axis surrounded by many\r\n  Leaves, which shows their simple shape and single central vascular\r\n  bundle _v_]\r\n\r\nThe markings left on the well-preserved leaf-scars indicate the main\r\nfeatures of the internal anatomy of the leaves. They had a single central\r\nvascular strand (_v_, fig. 93), on either side of which ran a strand of\r\nsoft tissue _p_ called the parichnos, which is characteristic of the\r\nplants of this group. While another similarly obscure structure\r\nassociated with the leaf is the little scale-like ligule _l_ on its upper\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe anatomy of the stems is interesting, for in the different species\r\ndifferent stages of advance are to be found, from the simple solid\r\nprotostele with a uniform mass of wood to hollow ring steles with a pith.\r\nAn interesting intermediate stage between these two is found in\r\n_Lepidodendron selaginoides_ (see fig. 95), where the central cells of\r\nthe wood are not true water-conducting cells, but short irregular\r\nwater-storage tracheides (see p. 56), which are mixed with parenchyma.\r\nAll the genera of these fossils have a single central stele, round which\r\nit is usual to find a zone of secondary wood of greater or less extent\r\naccording to the age of the plant.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 95.—Transverse Section of _Lepidodendron\r\n  selaginoides_, showing the circular mass of primary wood, the central\r\n  cells of which are irregular water-storage tracheides\r\n\r\n  _s_, Zone of secondary wood; _c_, inner cortical tissues; _r_,\r\n  intrusive burrowing rootlet; _oc_, outer cortical tissues with corky\r\n  external layers _k_. (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nSome stems instead of this compact central stele have a ring of wood with\r\nan extensive pith. Such a type is illustrated in fig. 96, which shows but\r\na part of the circle of wood, and the zone of the secondary wood outside\r\nit, which greatly exceeds the primary mass in thickness. This zone of\r\nsecondary wood became very extensive in old stems, for, as will be\r\nimagined, the primary wood was not sufficient to supply the large trunks.\r\nThe method of its development from a normal cambium in radiating rows of\r\nuniform tracheides is quite similar to that which is found in the pines\r\nto-day. This is the most important difference between the living and the\r\nfossil stems of the family, for no living plants of the family have such\r\nsecondary wood. On the other hand, the individual elements of this wood\r\nare different from those of the higher families hitherto considered, and\r\nhave narrow slit-like pits separated by bands of thickening on the\r\nlongitudinal walls. Such tracheides are found commonly in the\r\nPteridophytes, both living and fossil. Their type is seen in fig. 96, B,\r\nwhich should be compared with that in figs. 78, A and 62, B to see the\r\ncontrast with the higher groups.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 96.—A, _Lepidodendron_ Stem with Hollow Ring of\r\n  Wood W and Zone of Secondary Wood S. B, Longitudinal View of the Narrow\r\n  Pits of the Wood Elements.]\r\n\r\nTo supply the vascular tissues of the leaf traces, simple strands come\r\noff from the outer part of the primary wood, where groups of small-celled\r\nprotoxylem project (see _px_ in fig. 97). The leaf strands _lt_ move out\r\nthrough the cortex in considerable numbers to supply the many leaves,\r\ninto each of which a single one enters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 97.—Transverse Section of Outer Part of Primary\r\n  Wood of _Lepidodendron_, showing _px_, projecting protoxylem groups;\r\n  _lt_, leaf trace coming from the stele and passing (as _lt_^1) through\r\n  the cortex]\r\n\r\nAs regards the fructifications of _Lepidodendron_ much could be said were\r\nthere space. The many genera of _Lepidodendron_ bore several distinct\r\ntypes of cones of different degrees of complexity. In several of the\r\ngenera the cones were simple in organization, directly comparable with\r\nthose of the living Lycopods, though on a much larger scale (see p. 67).\r\nIn some the spores were uniform, all developing equally in numerous\r\ntetrads. The sporophyll was radially extended, and along it the large\r\nsausage-shaped sporangia were attached (see fig. 98). The tips of the\r\nsporophylls overlapped and afforded protection to the sporangia. The axis\r\nof the cone had a central stele with wood elements like those in the\r\nstem. The appearance of a transverse section of an actual cone is shown\r\nin fig. 99. Here the sporangia are irregular in shape, owing to their\r\ncontraction after ripeness and during fossilization. Other cones had\r\nsporangia similar in size and shape, but which produced spores of two\r\nkinds, large ones resulting from the ripening of only two or three\r\ntetrads in the lower sporangia, and numerous small ones in the sporangia\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 98.—Longitudinal Diagram, showing the arrangement\r\n  of the elongated sporangia on the sporophylls\r\n\r\n  _a_, Main axis, round which the sporophylls are inserted; S,\r\n  sporangium; _s_, leaflike end of sporophyll.]\r\n\r\nThe similarity between the _Lepidodendron_ and the modern Lycopod cone\r\nhas been pointed out already (p. 67), and it is this which forms the\r\nprincipal guarantee that they belong to the same family, though the size\r\nand wood development of the palæozoic and the modern plants differ so\r\ngreatly.\r\n\r\nThe large group of the Lepidodendra included some members whose\r\nfructifications had advanced so far beyond the simple sporangial cones\r\ndescribed above as to approach very closely to seeds in their\r\nconstruction. This type was described on p. 75, fig. 54, in a series of\r\nfemale fructifications, so that its essential structure need not be\r\nrecapitulated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 99.—Transverse Section through Cone of\r\n  _Lepidodendron_\r\n\r\n  A, Main axis with woody tissue; _st_, stalks of sporophylls cut in\r\n  oblique longitudinal direction; _s_, tips of sporophylls cut across; S,\r\n  sporangia with a few groups of spores. (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nThe section shown in fig. 100 is that cut at right angles to that in\r\nwhich the sporangia are shown in fig. 98, viz. tangential to the axis. A\r\nremarkable feature of the plant is that there were also round those\r\nsporangia which bore the numerous small spores (corresponding to pollen\r\ngrains) enclosing integument-like flaps similar to those shown in fig.\r\n100, _sp. f_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 100.—Section through one Sporangium of\r\n  _Lepidocarpon_\r\n\r\n  _sp_, Sporophyll; _sp.f._, flaps of sporophyll protecting sporangium;\r\n  S, large spore within the sporangium wall _w_; _s_, the three aborted\r\n  spores of the tetrad to which S belongs.]\r\n\r\nThis type of fructification is the nearest approach to seed and pollen\r\ngrains reached by any of the Pteridophytes, and its appearance at a time\r\nwhen the Lycopods were one of the dominant families is suggestive of the\r\neffect that such a position has on the families occupying it, however\r\nlowly they may be. The simple Pteridophyte Lycopods had not only the tall\r\ntrunks and solid woody structure of a modern tree, but also a semblance\r\nof its seeds. Whether this line of development ever led on to any of the\r\nhigher families is still uncertain. The feeling of most specialists is\r\nthat it did not; but there are not wanting men who support the view that\r\nthe lycopod affinity evolved in time and entered the ranks of the higher\r\nplants, and indeed there are many points of superficial likeness between\r\nthe palæozoic Lycopods and the Coniferæ. Judged from their internal\r\nstructure, however, the series through the ferns and Pteridosperms leads\r\nmuch more convincingly to the seed plants.\r\n\r\nIn their roots, or rather in the underground structures commonly called\r\nroots, the Lepidodendrons were also remarkable. Even more symmetrically\r\nthan in their above-ground branching, the base of their trunks divided;\r\nthere were four main large divisions, each of which branched into two and\r\nthese into two again. These structures were called _Stigmaria_, and were\r\ncommon to all species of _Lepidodendron_ and also the group of\r\n_Sigillaria_ (see fig. 102). On these horizontally running structures\r\n(well shown in the frontispiece) small appendages were borne all over\r\ntheir surface in great profusion, which were, both in their function and\r\nmicroscopic structure, rootlets. They left circular scars of a\r\ncharacteristic appearance on the big trunks, of which they were the only\r\nappendages. These scars show clearly on the fragments along the ledge to\r\nthe left of the photograph. The exact morphological nature of the big\r\naxes is not known; their anatomy is not like that of roots, but is that\r\nof a stem, yet they do not bear what practically every stem, whether\r\nunderground or not, has developed, namely leaves, or scales representing\r\nreduced leaves. Their nature has been commented on previously (p. 69),\r\nand we cannot discuss the point further, but must be content to consider\r\nthem as a form of root-bearing stem, practically confined to the Lycopods\r\nand principally developed among the palæozoic fossils of that group.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 101.—Transverse Section through a Rootlet of\r\n  _Stigmaria_\r\n\r\n  _oc_, Outer cortex; _s_, space; _ic_, inner cortex; _w_, wood of\r\n  vascular strand (wood only preserved); _px_, protoxylem group.]\r\n\r\nIn microscopic structure the rootlets are extremely well known, because\r\nin their growth they have penetrated the masses of the tissues of other\r\nplants which were being petrified and have become petrified with them.\r\nThe mass of decaying vegetable tissue on which the living plants of the\r\nperiod flourished were everywhere pierced by these intrusive rootlets,\r\nand they are found petrified inside otherwise perfect seeds, in the\r\nhearts of woody stems, in leaves and sporangia, and sometimes even inside\r\neach other! Fig. 95 shows such a root _r_ lying in the space left by the\r\ndecay of the soft tissue of the inner cortex in an otherwise excellently\r\npreserved _Lepidodendron_ stem (see also fig. 101). In fig. 101 their\r\nsimple structure is seen. They are often extremely irregular in shape,\r\nowing to the way they seem to have twisted and flattened themselves in\r\norder to fit into the tissues they were penetrating. No root hairs seem\r\nto have been developed in these rootlets, but otherwise their structure\r\nis that of a typical simple root, and very like the swamp-penetrating\r\nrootlets of the living Isoetes.\r\n\r\nThe Stigmarian axes and their rootlets are very commonly found in the\r\n“underclays” and “gannister” beds which lie below the coal seams (see p.\r\n25), and they may sometimes be seen attached to a bit of the trunk\r\ngrowing upwards through the layers. They and the aerial stems of\r\nLepidodendron are perhaps the commonest and most widely known of fossil\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the palæozoic Lycopods another genus must be mentioned,\r\nwhich is also a widely spread and important one, though it is less well\r\nknown than its contemporary. The genus _Sigillaria_ is best known by its\r\nimpressions and casts of stems covered by leaf scars. The stems were\r\nsometimes deeply ribbed, and the leaf scars were arranged in rows and\r\nwere more or less hexagonal in outline, as is seen in fig. 102, which\r\nshows a cast and its reverse of the stem of a typical _Sigillaria_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 102.—Cast and Reverse of Leaf Scars of\r\n  _Sigillaria_. In A the shape of the leaf bases is clearly shown, the\r\n  central markings in each being the scar of the vascular bundle and\r\n  parichnos]\r\n\r\nIn its primary wood _Sigillaria_ differed from _Lepidodendron_ in being\r\nmore remote from the type with a primary solid stele. Its woody structure\r\nwas that of a ring, in some cases irregularly broken up into\r\ncrescent-shaped bundles. The secondary wood was quite similar to that of\r\n_Lepidodendron_.\r\n\r\n_Stigmaria_ and its rootlets belong equally to the two plants, and\r\nhitherto it has been impossible to tell whether any given specimen of\r\n_Stigmaria_ had belonged to a _Lepidodendron_ or a _Sigillaria_. Between\r\nthe two genera there certainly existed the closest affinity and\r\nsimilarity in general appearance.\r\n\r\nThese two genera represent the climax of development of the Lycopod\r\nfamily. In the Lower Mesozoic some large forms are still found, but all\r\nthrough the Mesozoic periods the group dwindled, and in the Tertiary\r\nlittle is known of it, and it seems to have taken the retiring position\r\nit occupies to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                          VIII. The Horsetails\r\n\r\n\r\nThe horsetails of to-day all belong to the one genus, _Equisetum_, among\r\nthe different species of which there is a remarkably close similarity.\r\nMost of the species love swampy land, and even grow standing up through\r\nwater; but some live on the dry clay of ploughed fields. Wherever they\r\ngrow they usually congregate in large numbers, and form little groves\r\ntogether. They are easily recognized by their delicate stems, branching\r\nin bottle-brush fashion, and the small leaves arranged round them in\r\nwhorls, with their narrow teeth joined to a ring at the base. At the end\r\nof some of the branches come the cones, with compactly arranged and\r\nsimple sporophylls all of one kind. In England most plants of this family\r\nare but a few inches or a foot in height, though one species sometimes\r\nreaches 6 ft., while in South America there are groves of\r\ndelicate-stemmed plants 20 ft. high.\r\n\r\nThe ribbed stems and the whorls of small, finely toothed leaves are the\r\nmost important external characteristics of the plants, while in their\r\ninternal anatomy the hollow stems have very little wood, which is\r\narranged in a series of small bundles, each associated with a hollow\r\ncanal in the ground tissue.\r\n\r\nThe family stands apart from all others, and even between it and the\r\ngroup of Lycopods there seems to be a big gap across which stretch no\r\nbonds of affinity. Has the group always been in a similar position, and\r\nstood isolated in a backwater of the stream of plant life?\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 103.—Impression of Leaf Whorl of _Equisetites_ from\r\n  the Mesozoic Rocks, showing the narrow toothed form of the leaves.\r\n  (Photo.)]\r\n\r\nIn the late Tertiary period they seem to have held much the same position\r\nas they do now, and we learn nothing new of them from rocks of that age.\r\nWhen, however, we come to the Mesozoic, the members of the family are of\r\ngreater size, though they appear (to judge from their external\r\nappearance) to have been practically identical with those now living in\r\nall their arrangements. In some beds their impressions are very numerous,\r\nbut unfortunately most are without any indication of internal structure.\r\nFossils from the Mesozoic are called _Equisetites_, a name which\r\nindicates that they come very close to the living ones in their\r\ncharacters. In the Lower Mesozoic some of these stems seem to have\r\nreached the great size of a couple of feet in circumference, but to have\r\nno essential difference from the others of the group.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we come to the Palæozoic rocks we find many specimens with\r\ntheir structure preserved, and we are at once in a very different\r\nposition as regards the family.\r\n\r\nFirst in the Permian we meet with the important genus of plant called\r\n_Calamites_, which were very abundant in the Coal Measures. Many of the\r\nCalamites were of great size, for specimens with large trunks have been\r\nfound 30 ft. and more long, which when growing must certainly have been\r\nmuch taller than that. The number of individuals must also have been very\r\ngreat, for casts and impressions of the genus are among the commonest\r\nfossils. They were, in fact, one of the dominant groups of the period.\r\nLike the Lycopods, the Equisetaceæ reached their high-water mark of\r\ndevelopment in the Carboniferous period; at that time the plants were\r\nmost numerous, and of the largest size and most complicated structure\r\nthat they ever attained.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 104.—Small Branches attached to stouter Axis of\r\n  _Calamites_. Photo of Impression]\r\n\r\nAs will be immediately suspected from analogy with the Lycopods, they\r\ndiffered from the modern members of the family in their strongly\r\ndeveloped anatomy, and in the strength and quantity of their secondary\r\nwood. Yet in their external appearance they probably resembled the living\r\ngenus in all essentials, and the groves of the larger ones of to-day\r\ngrowing in the marshes probably have the appearance that the palæozoic\r\nplants would have had if looked at through a reversed opera glass.\r\n\r\nFig. 104 is a photograph of some of the small branches of a Calamite, in\r\nwhich the ribbed stem can be seen, and on the small side twigs the fine,\r\npointed leaves lying in whorls.\r\n\r\nIn most of the fossil specimens, however, particularly the larger ones,\r\nthe ribs are not those of the true surface, but are those marked on the\r\n_internal cast_ of the pith.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 105.—Transverse Section of _Calamites_ Stem with\r\n  Secondary Wood _w_ formed in Regular Radial Rows in a Solid Ring\r\n\r\n  _c_, Canals associated with the primary bundles; _p_, cells of the\r\n  pith, which is hollow with a cavity _l_, _cor_, Cortex and outer\r\n  tissues well preserved. (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nAmong tissue petrifactions there are many Calamite stems of various\r\nstages of growth. In the very young ones there are only primary bundles,\r\nand these little stems are like those of a living Equisetum in their\r\nanatomy, and have a hollow pith and small vascular bundles with canals\r\nassociated. The fossil forms, however, soon began to grow secondary wood,\r\nwhich developed in regular radial rows from a cambium behind the primary\r\nbundles and joined to a complete ring.\r\n\r\nA stem in this stage of development is seen in fig. 105, where only the\r\nwood and internal tissues are preserved. The very characteristic canals\r\nassociated with the primary bundles are clearly shown. The amount of\r\nsecondary wood steadily increased as the stems grew (there appear to have\r\nbeen no “annual rings”) till there was a very large quantity of secondary\r\ntissue of regular texture, through which ran small medullary rays, so\r\nthat the stems became increasingly like those of the higher plants as\r\nthey grew older. It is the primary structure which is the important\r\nfactor in considering their affinity, and that is essentially the same as\r\nin the other members of the family in which secondary thickening is not\r\ndeveloped. As we have seen already in other groups of fossils, secondary\r\nwood appears to develop on similar lines whenever it is needed in any\r\ngroup, and therefore has but little value as an indication of systematic\r\nposition. This important fact is one, however, which has only been\r\nrealized as a result of the study of fossil plants.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 106.—Diagram of the Arrangement of the Bundles at\r\n  the Node of a _Calamite_, showing how those of consecutive internodes\r\n  alternate\r\n\r\n  _n_, Region of node]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 107.—Leaf of _Calamites_ in Cross Section\r\n\r\n  _v_, Vascular bundles; _s_, cells of sheath, filled with blackened\r\n  contents; _p_, palisade cells; _e_, epidermis.]\r\n\r\nThe longitudinal section of the stems, when cut tangentially, is very\r\ncharacteristic, as the bundles run straight down to each node and there\r\ndivide, the neighbouring halves joining so that the bundles of each node\r\nalternate with those of the ones above and below it (see fig. 106).\r\n\r\nThe leaves which were attached at the nodes were naturally much larger\r\nthan those of the present Equisetums, though they were similarly simple\r\nand undivided. Their anatomy is preserved in a number of cases (see fig.\r\n107), and was simple, with a single small strand of vascular tissue lying\r\nin the centre. They had certain large cells, sometimes very black in the\r\nfossils, which may have been filled with mucilage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 108.—Transverse Section of Young Root of\r\n  _Calamites_\r\n\r\n  _w_, Wood of axis; _l_, spaces in the lacunar cortex, whose radiating\r\n  strands _r_ are somewhat crushed; _ex_, outermost cells of cortex with\r\n  thickened wall.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 109.—Diagram of Cone of _Calamites_\r\n\r\n  A, Main axis; _br_, sterile bracts; _sp_, sporophylls with four\r\n  sporangia S attached to each, of which two only are seen.]\r\n\r\nThe young roots of these plants have a very characteristic cortex, which\r\nconsists of cells loosely built together in a lacelike fashion, with\r\nlarge air spaces, so that they are much like water plants in their\r\nappearance (see fig. 108). Indeed, so unlike the old roots and the stems\r\nare they, that for long they were called by another name and supposed to\r\nbe submerged stems, but their connection with _Calamites_ is now quite\r\ncertain. As their woody axis develops, the secondary tissue increases and\r\npushes off the lacelike cortex, and the roots become very similar in\r\ntheir anatomy to the stems. Both have similar zones of secondary wood,\r\nbut the roots do not have those primary canals which are so\r\ncharacteristic of the stems, and thereby they can be readily\r\ndistinguished from them.\r\n\r\nThe fructifications of the Calamites were not unlike those of the living\r\ntypes of the family, though in some respects slightly more complex. Round\r\neach cone axis developed rings of sporophylls which alternated with\r\nsterile sheathing bracts. Each sporophyll was shaped like a small\r\numbrella with four spokes, and stood at right angles to the axis, bearing\r\na sporangium at each of the spokes. A diagram of this arrangement is seen\r\nin fig. 109.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 110.—Longitudinal Section of Part of _Calamites_\r\n  Cone\r\n\r\n  _br_, Sterile bracts attached to axis; _sp_, attachment of sporophylls;\r\n  S, sporangia. At X a group of four sporangia is seen round the\r\n  sporophyll, which is seen at _a_. (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nA photograph of an actual section of such a cone, cut slightly obliquely\r\nthrough the length of the axis, is seen in fig. 110, where the upper\r\ngroups of sporangia are cut tangentially, and show their grouping round\r\nthe sporophyll to which they are attached.\r\n\r\nA few single tetrads of spores are enlarged in fig. 111, where it will be\r\nseen that the large spores are of a similar size, but that the small ones\r\nof the tetrads are very irregular. They are aborting members of the\r\ntetrad, and appear to have been used as food by the other spores. In each\r\nsporangium large numbers of these tetrads develop and all the ripe spores\r\nseem to have been of one size.\r\n\r\nIn a species of _Calamites_ (_C. casheana_), otherwise very similar to\r\nthe common one we have been considering, there is a distinct difference\r\nin the sizes of the spores from different sporangia. The small ones,\r\nhowever, were only about one-third of the diameter of the large ones, so\r\nthat the difference was very much less marked than it was between the\r\nsmall and large spores of the Lycopods.\r\n\r\nAmong the palæozoic members of the group are other genera closely allied\r\nto, but differing from _Calamites_ in some particulars. One of these is\r\n_Archæocalamites_, which has a cone almost identical with that of the\r\nliving Equisetums, as it has no sterile bracts mingled with the\r\numbrella-like sporophylls. Other genera are more complex than those\r\ndescribed for _Calamites_, and even in the simple coned _Archæocalamites_\r\nitself the leaves are finely branched and divided instead of being simple\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nBut no genus is so completely known as is _Calamites_, which will itself\r\nsuffice as an illustration of the palæozoic Equisetaceæ. Though the\r\ngenus, as was pointed out above, shows several important characters\r\ndiffering from those of Equisetum, and parallel to some extent to those\r\nof the palæozoic Lycopods, yet these features are more of a physiological\r\nnature than a systematic one, and they throw no light on the origin of\r\nthe family or on its connection with the other Pteridophytes. It is in\r\nthe extinct family dealt with in the next chapter that we find what some\r\nconsider as a clue to the solution of these problems.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 111.—Tetrads of Spores of _Calamites_\r\n\r\n  S, Normal-sized spores; _a_, _b_, &c., aborting spores.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                          IX. Sphenophyllales\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group to which _Sphenophyllum_ belongs is of considerable interest\r\nand importance, and is, further, one of those extinct families whose very\r\nexistence would never have been suspected had it not been discovered by\r\nfossil botanists. Not only is the family as a whole extinct, it also\r\nshows features in its anatomy which are not to be paralleled among living\r\nstems. _Sphenophyllum_ became extinct in the Palæozoic period, but its\r\ninterest is very real and living to-day, and in the peculiar features of\r\nits structure we see the first clue that suggests a common ancestor for\r\nthe still living groups of Lycopods and Equisetaceæ, which now stand so\r\nisolated and far apart.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, we can consider the affinities of the group, we must\r\ndescribe the structure of a typical plant belonging to it. The genus\r\n_Sphenophyllum_ includes several species (for which there are no common\r\nEnglish names, as they are only known to science) whose differences are\r\nof less importance than their points of similarity, so that one species\r\nonly, _S. plurifoliatum_, will be described.\r\n\r\nWe have a general knowledge of the external appearance of _Sphenophyllum_\r\nfrom the numerous impressions of leaves attached to twigs which are found\r\nin the rocks of the Carboniferous period. These impressions present a\r\ngood deal of variety, but all have rather delicate stems with whorls of\r\nleaves attached at regular intervals. The specimens are generally easy to\r\nrecognize from the shape of the leaves, which are like broad wedges\r\nattached at the point (see fig. 112). In some cases the leaves are more\r\nfinely divided and less fanlike, and it may even happen that on the same\r\nbranch some may be wedge-shaped like those in fig. 112, and others almost\r\nhairlike. This naturally suggests comparison with water plants, which\r\nhave finely divided submerged leaves and expanded aerial ones. In the\r\ncase of _Sphenophyllum_, however, the divided leaves sometimes come at\r\nthe upper ends of the stems, quite near the cones, and so can hardly have\r\nbeen those of a submerged part. The very delicate stems and some points\r\nin their internal anatomy suggest that the plant was a trailing creeper\r\nwhich supported itself on the stouter stems of other plants.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 112.—Impression of _Sphenophyllum_ Leaves attached\r\n  to the Stem, showing the wedge-shaped leaflets arranged in whorls]\r\n\r\nThe stems were ribbed, but unlike those of the Calamites the ribs ran\r\nstraight down the stem through the nodes, and did not alternate there, so\r\nthat the bundles at the node did not branch and fuse as they did in\r\n_Calamites_.\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of the long slender cones was not unlike that of\r\nthe Calamite cones, though their internal details showed important\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\nIn one noticeable external feature the plants differed from those of the\r\nlast two groups considered, and that was in their _size_. Palæozoic\r\nLycopods and Equisetaceæ reached the dimensions of great trees, but\r\nhitherto no treelike form of _Sphenophyllum_ has been discovered, and in\r\nthe structure-petrifactions the largest stems we know were less than an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn the internal anatomy of these stems lies one of the chief interests\r\nand peculiarities of the plants. In the very young stage there was a\r\nsharply pointed solid triangle of wood in the centre (fig. 113), at each\r\nof the corners of which was a group of small cells, the protoxylems. The\r\nstructure of such a stem is like that of a root, in which the primary\r\nwood all grows inwards from the protoxylems towards the centre, and had\r\nwe had nothing but these isolated young stems it would have been\r\nimpossible to recognize their true nature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 113.—_Sphenophyllum_, Transverse Section of Young\r\n  Stem\r\n\r\n  _c_, Cortex, the soft tissue within which has decayed and left a space,\r\n  in which lies the solid triangle of wood, with the small protoxylem\r\n  groups _px_ at each corner. (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nSuch very young stems are rare, for the development of secondary wood\r\nbegan early, and it soon greatly exceeded the primary wood in amount.\r\nFig. 114 shows a photograph of a stem in which the secondary wood is well\r\ndeveloped. The primary triangle of wood is still to be seen in the\r\ncentre, and corresponds to that in fig. 113, while closely fitting to it\r\nare the bays of the first-formed secondary wood, which makes the wood\r\nmass roughly circular. Outside this the secondary wood forms a regular\r\ncylinder round the axis, which shows no sign of annual rings. The cells\r\nof the wood are large and approximately square in shape, while at the\r\nangles formed at the junction of every four cells is a group of small,\r\nthin-walled parenchyma, see fig. 115. There are no medullary rays going\r\nout radially through the wood, such as are found in all other zones of\r\nsecondary wood, and in this arrangement of soft tissue the plants are\r\nunique.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 114.—_Sphenophyllum_, Transverse Section with\r\n  Secondary Wood W. At _c_ the cork formation is to be seen.\r\n  (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\nBeyond the wood was a zone of soft tissue and phloem, which is not often\r\npreserved, while outside that was the cork, which added to the cortical\r\ntissues as the stem grew (see fig. 114, _c_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 115.—Group of Wood Cells _w_, showing their shape\r\n  and the small soft-walled cells at the angles between them _p_]\r\n\r\nPetrified material of leaves and roots is rare, and both are chiefly\r\nknown through the work of the French palæobotanist Renault. The leaves\r\nare chiefly remarkable for the bands of sclerized strengthening tissue,\r\nand generally had the structure of aerial, not submerged leaves. The\r\nroots were simple in structure, and, as in _Calamites_, had secondary\r\ntissue like that in the stems.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the fructifications it is the English material which has\r\nyielded the most illuminating specimens. The cones were long and slender,\r\nexternally covered by the closely packed tips of the scales, which\r\noverlapped deeply. Between the whorls of scales lay the sporangia,\r\nattached to their upper sides by slender stalks. A diagram will best\r\nexplain how they were arranged (see fig. 116). Two sporangia were\r\nattached to each bract, but their stalks were of different lengths, so\r\nthat one sporangium lay near the axis and one lay outside it toward the\r\ntip of the bract.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 116.—Diagram of Arrangement of Scales and Sporangia\r\n  in Cones of _Sphenophyllum_\r\n\r\n  A, Axis; _br_, bract; S, sporangium, with stalk _st_.]\r\n\r\nIn its anatomy the stalk of the cone has certain features similar to\r\nthose in the stem proper, which were among the first indications that led\r\nto the discovery that the cone belonged to _Sphenophyllum_. There were\r\nnumerous spores in each of the sporangia, which had coats ornamented with\r\nlittle spines when they were ripe (fig. 117, if examined with a\r\nmagnifying glass, will show this). Hitherto the only spores known are of\r\nuniform size, and there is no evidence that there was any differentiation\r\ninto small (male) and large (female) spores such as were found in some of\r\nthe Lepidodendrons. In this respect _Sphenophyllum_ was less specialized\r\nthan either _Lepidodendron_ or _Calamites_.\r\n\r\nIn the actual sections of _Sphenophyllum_ cones the numerous sporangia\r\nseem massed together in confusion, but usually some are cut so as to show\r\nthe attachment of the stalk, as in fig. 117, _st_. As the stalk was long\r\nand slender, but a short length of it is usually cut through in any one\r\nsection, and to realize their mode of attachment to the axis (as shown in\r\nfig. 116) it is necessary to study a series of sections.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 117.—Part of Cone of _Sphenophyllum_, showing\r\n  sporangia _sp_, some of which are cut so as to show a part of their\r\n  stalks _st_. B, Bract. (Microphoto.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the other plants belonging to the group, _Bowmanites Römeri_ is\r\nspecially interesting. Its sporangia were borne on stalks similar to\r\nthose of _Sphenophyllum_, but each stalk had two sporangia attached to\r\nit. Two sporangia are also borne on each stalk in _S. fertile_. These\r\nplants help in elucidating the nature of the stalked sporangia of\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, for they seem to indicate a direct comparison between\r\nthem and the sporophylls of the Equisetales.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, further, another plant, of which we only know the cone, of\r\nstill greater importance. This cone (_Cheirostrobus_) is, however, so\r\ncomplex that it would take far too much space to describe it in detail.\r\nEven a diagram of its arrangements is extraordinarily elaborate. To the\r\nspecialist the cone is peculiarly fascinating, for its very complexity\r\ngives him great scope for weaving theories about it; but for our purposes\r\nmost of these are too abstruse.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 118.—A, Diagram of Three-lobed Bract from Cone of\r\n  _Cheirostrobus_. _a_, Axis; _br_, the three sterile lower lobes of the\r\n  bract; _sp_, the three upper sporophyll-like lobes, to each of which\r\n  were attached four sporangia S. B, Part of the above seen in section\r\n  longitudinal to the axis. (Modified from Scott.)]\r\n\r\nIts most important features are the following. Round the axis were series\r\nof scales, twelve in each whorl, and each scale was divided into an upper\r\nand a lower portion, each of which again divided into three lobes. The\r\nlower three of each of these scale groups were sterile and bractlike,\r\ncomparable, perhaps, with the bracts in fig. 116; while the upper three\r\ndivisions were stalks round each of which were four sporangia. Each\r\nsporophyll segment thus resembled the sporophyll of _Calamites_, while\r\nthe long sausage-shaped sporangia themselves were more like those of\r\n_Lepidodendron_. In fig. 118 is a diagram of a trilobed bract with its\r\nthree attached sporophylls. Round the axis were very numerous whorls of\r\nsuch bracts, and as the cone was large there were enormous numbers of\r\nspore sacs.\r\n\r\nA point of interest is the character of the wood of the main axis, which\r\nis similar to that of Lepidodendron in many respects, being a ring of\r\ncentripetally developed wood with twelve projecting external points of\r\nprotoxylem.\r\n\r\nThis cone[13] is the most complex fructification of any of the known\r\nPteridophytes, whether living or fossil, which alone ensures it a special\r\nimportance, though for our purpose the mixed affinities it shows are of\r\ngreater interest.\r\n\r\nTo mention some of its characters:—The individual segments of the\r\nsporophylls, each bearing four sporangia, are comparable with those of\r\n_Calamites_, while the individual sporangia and the length of the\r\nsporophyll stalk are similar in appearance to those of _Lepidodendron_.\r\nThe wood of the main axis also resembles that of a typical\r\n_Lepidodendron_. The way the vascular bundles of the bract pass out from\r\nthe axis, and the way the stalks bearing the sporangia are attached to\r\nthe sterile part of the bracts, are like the corresponding features in\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, and still more like _Bowmanites_.\r\n\r\nMany other points of comparison are to be found in these plants, but\r\nwithout going into further detail enough has been indicated to support\r\nthe conclusion that _Cheirostrobus_ is a very important clue to the\r\naffinities of the Sphenophyllales and early Pteridophytes. It is indeed\r\nconsidered to have belonged to an ancient stock of plants, from which the\r\nEquisetaceæ, and _Sphenophylla_, and possibly also the Lycopods all\r\nsprang.\r\n\r\n_Sphenophyllum_, _Bowmanites_, and _Cheirostrobus_, a series of forms\r\nthat became extinct in the Palæozoic, remote in their structure from any\r\nliving types, whose existence would have been entirely unsuspected but\r\nfor the work of fossil botany, are yet the clues which have led to a\r\npartial solution of the mysteries surrounding the present-day Lycopods\r\nand Equisetums, and which help to bridge the chasm between these remote\r\nand degenerate families.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n                    PAST HISTORIES OF PLANT FAMILIES\r\n                          X. The Lower Plants\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the plant world of to-day there are many families including immense\r\nnumbers of species whose organization is simpler than that of the groups\r\nhitherto considered. Taken all together they form, in fact, a very large\r\nproportion of the total number of living species, though the bulk of them\r\nare of small size, and many are microscopic.\r\n\r\nThese “lower plants” include all the mosses, and the flat green\r\nliverworts, the lichens, the toadstools, and all the innumerable moulds\r\nand parasites causing plant diseases, the green weeds growing in water,\r\nand all the seaweeds, large and small, in the sea, the minute green cells\r\ngrowing in crevices of the bark of trees, and all the similar ones living\r\nby millions in water. Truly a host of forms with an endless variety of\r\nstructures.\r\n\r\nYet when we turn to the fossil representatives of this formidable\r\nmultitude, we find but few. Indeed, of the fossil members of all these\r\ngroups taken together we know less that is of importance and real\r\ninterest than we do of any single family of those hitherto considered.\r\nThe reasons for this dearth of fossils of the lower types are not quite\r\napparent, but one which may have some bearing on it is the difficulty of\r\nmineralization. It is self-evident that the more delicate and soft-walled\r\nany structure is the less chance has it of being preserved without decay\r\nlong enough to be fossilized. As will have been understood from Chapter\r\nII, even when the process of fossilization took place, geologically\r\nspeaking, rapidly, it can never have been actually accomplished quickly\r\nas compared with the counter processes of decay. Hence all the lower\r\nplants, with their soft tissue and lack of wood and strengthening cells,\r\nseem on the face of it to stand but little chance of petrifaction.\r\n\r\nThere is much in this argument, but it is not a sufficient explanation of\r\nthe rarity of lower plant fossils. All through the preceding chapters\r\nmention has been made of very delicate cells, such as pith, spores, and\r\neven germinating spores (see fig. 47, p. 68), with their most delicate\r\noutgrowing cells. If then such small and delicate elements from the\r\nhigher plants are preserved, why should not many of the lower plants\r\n(some of which are large and sturdy) be found in the rocks?\r\n\r\nAs regards the first group, the mosses, it is probable that they did not\r\nexist in the Palæozoic period, whence our most delicately preserved\r\nfossils are derived. There seems much to support the view that they have\r\nevolved comparatively recently although they are less highly organized\r\nthan the ferns. Quite recently experiments have been made with their near\r\nallies the liverworts, and those which were placed for one year under\r\nconditions similar to those under which plant petrifaction took place,\r\nwere found to be perfectly preserved at the end of the period; though\r\nthey would naturally decay rapidly under usual conditions. This shows\r\nthat Bryophyte cells are not peculiarly incapable of preservation as\r\nfossils, and adds weight to the negative evidence of the rocks,\r\nstrengthening the presumption of their late origin.\r\n\r\nThat some of the lower plants, among the very lowest and simplest, can be\r\nwell preserved is shown in the case of the fossil fungi which often occur\r\nin microscopic sections of palæozoic leaves, where they infest the higher\r\nplants as similar parasitic species do to-day.\r\n\r\nWe must now bring forward the more important of the facts known about the\r\nfossils of the various groups of lower plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nBryophytes.—_Mosses._ Of this family there are no specimens of any age\r\nwhich are so preserved as to show their microscopical structure. Of\r\nimpressions there are a few from various beds which show, with more or\r\nless uncertainty in most cases, stems and leaves of what appear to be\r\nmosses similar to those now extant, but they nearly all lack the\r\nfructifications which would determine them with certainty. These\r\nimpressions go by the name of _Muscites_, which is a dignified cloak for\r\nignorance in most cases. The few which are quite satisfactory as\r\nimpressions belong to comparatively recent rocks.\r\n\r\n_Liverworts_ are similarly scanty, and there is nothing among them which\r\ncould throw any light on the living forms or their evolution. The more\r\ncommon are of the same types as the recent ones, and are called\r\n_Marchantites_, specimens of which have been found in beds of various\r\nages, chiefly, however, in the more recent periods of the earth’s\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIt is of interest to note that among all the delicate tissue which is so\r\nwell preserved in the “coal balls” and other palæozoic petrifactions,\r\nthere are no specimens which give evidence of the existence of mosses at\r\nthat time. It is not unlikely that they may have evolved more recently\r\nthan the other groups of the “lower” plants.\r\n\r\nCharaceæ.—Members of this somewhat isolated family (Stoneworts) are\r\nbetter known, as they frequently occur as fossil casts. This is probably\r\ndue to their character, for even while alive they tend to cover their\r\ndelicate stems and leaves, and even fruits, with a limy incrustation.\r\nThis assists fossilization to some degree, and fossil Charas are not\r\nuncommon. Usually they are from the recently deposited rocks, and the\r\nearliest true Charas date only to the middle of the Mesozoic.\r\n\r\nAn interesting occurrence is the petrifaction of masses of these plants\r\ntogether, which indicate the existence of an ancient pool in which they\r\nmust have grown in abundance at one time. A case has been described where\r\nmasses of _Chara_ are petrified where they seem to have been growing, and\r\nin their accumulations had gradually filled up the pond till they had\r\naccumulated to a height of 8 feet.\r\n\r\nThe plants, however, have little importance from our present point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\nFungi.—Of the higher fungi, namely, “toadstools”, we have no true\r\nfossils. Some indications of them have been found in amber, but such\r\nspecimens are so unsatisfactory that they can hardly afford much\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 119.—The Hyphæ of Fungi Parasitic on a Woody Tree\r\n\r\n  _c_, Cells of host; _h_, hyphæ of fungus, with dividing cell walls.]\r\n\r\nThe lower fungi, however, and in particular the microscopic and parasitic\r\nforms, occur very frequently, and are found in the Coal Measure fossils.\r\nPenetrating the tissues of the higher plants, their hosts, the parasitic\r\ncells are often excellently preserved, and we may see their delicate\r\nhyphæ wandering from cell to cell as in fig. 119, while sometimes there\r\nare attached swollen cells which seem to be sporangia. From the Palæozoic\r\nwe get leaves with nests of spores of the fungus which had attacked and\r\nspotted them as so many do to leaves to-day (see fig. 120). What is\r\nspecially noticeable about these plants is their similarity to the living\r\nforms infesting the higher plants of the present day. Already in the\r\nPalæozoic the sharp distinction existed between the highly organized\r\nindependent higher plants and their simple parasites. The higher plants\r\nhave changed profoundly since that time, stimulated by ever-changing\r\nsurroundings, but the parasites living within them are now much as they\r\nwere then, just sufficiently highly organized to rob and reproduce.\r\n\r\nA form of fungus inhabitant which seems to be useful to the higher plant\r\nappears also to have existed in Palæozoic times, viz. _Mycorhiza_. In the\r\nroots of many living trees, particularly such as the Beech and its\r\nallies, the cells of the outer layers are penetrated by many fungal forms\r\nwhich live in association with the tree and do it some service at the\r\nsame time as gaining something for themselves. This curious, and as yet\r\nincompletely understood physiological relation between the higher plants\r\nand the fungi, existed so far back as the Palæozoic period, from which\r\nroots have been described whose cells were packed with minute organisms\r\napparently identical with _Mycorhiza_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 120.—Fossil Leaf _l_ with Nests of Infesting Fungal\r\n  Spores _f_ on its lower side]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlgæ.—_Green Algæ_ (pond weeds). Many impressions have been described as\r\nalgæ from time to time, numbers of which have since been shown to be a\r\nvariety of other things, sometimes not plants at all. Other impressions\r\nmay really be those of algæ, but hitherto they have added practically\r\nnothing to our knowledge of the group.\r\n\r\nSeveral genera of algæ coat themselves with calcareous matter while they\r\nare alive, much in the same way as do the Charas, and of these, as is\r\nnatural, there are quite a number of fossil remains from Tertiary and\r\nMesozoic rocks. This is still more the case in the group of the _Red\r\nAlgæ_ (seaweeds), of which the calcareous-coated genera, such as\r\n_Corallina_ and others, have many fossil representatives. These plants\r\nappear so like corals in many cases that they were long held to be of\r\nanimal nature. The genus _Lithothamnion_ now grows attached to rocks, and\r\nis thickly encrusted with calcareous matter. A good many species of this\r\ngenus have been described among fossils, particularly from the Tertiary\r\nand Cretaceous rocks. As the plant grew in association with animal\r\ncorals, it is not always very easy to separate it from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrown Algæ (seaweeds) have often been described as fossils. This is very\r\nnatural, as so many fossils have been found in marine deposits, and when\r\namong them there is anything showing a dark, wavy impression, it is\r\nusually described as a seaweed. And possibly it may be one, but such an\r\nimpression does not lead to much advance in knowledge. From the early\r\nPalæozoic rocks of both Europe and America a large fossil plant is known\r\nfrom the partially petrified structure of its stem. There seem to be\r\nseveral species, or at least different varieties of this, known under the\r\ngeneric name _Nematophycus_. Specimens of this genus are found to have\r\nseveral anatomical characters common to the big living seaweeds of the\r\n_Laminaria_ type, and it is very possible that the fossils represent an\r\nearly member of that group. In none of these petrified specimens,\r\nhowever, is there any indication of the microscopic structure of\r\nreproductive organs, so that the exact nature of the fossils is not\r\ndeterminable. It is probable that though perhaps allied to the Laminarias\r\nthey belong to an entirely extinct group.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and even amusing chapter might be written on all the\r\nfossils which look like algæ and even have been described as such. The\r\nminute river systems that form in the moist mud of a foreshore, if\r\npreserved in the rocks (as they often are, with the ripples and raindrops\r\nof the past), look extraordinarily like seaweeds—as do also countless\r\nimpressions and trails of animals. In this portion of the study of\r\nfossils it is better to have a healthy scepticism than an illuminating\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiatoms, with their hard siliceous shells, are naturally well preserved\r\nas fossils (see fig. 121), for even if the protoplasm decays the mineral\r\ncoats remain practically unchanged.\r\n\r\nDiatoms to-day exist in great numbers, both in the cold water of the\r\npolar regions and in the heat of hot springs. Often, in the latter, one\r\ncan see them actually being turned into fossils. In the Yellowstone Park\r\nthey are accumulating in vast numbers over large areas, and in some\r\nplaces have collected to a thickness of 6 feet. At the bottoms of\r\nfreshwater lakes they may form an almost pure mud of fine texture, while\r\non the floor of deep oceans there is an ooze of diatoms which have been\r\nseparated from the calcareous shells by their greater powers of\r\nresistance to solution by salt water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 121.—Diatom showing the Double Siliceous Coat]\r\n\r\nThere are enormous numbers of species now living, and of fossils from the\r\nTertiary and Upper Mesozoic rocks; but, strangely enough, though so\r\nnumerous and so widely distributed, both now and in these past periods,\r\nthey have not been found in the earlier rocks.\r\n\r\nIn one way the diatoms differ from ordinary fossils. In the latter the\r\nsoft tissues of the plant have been replaced by stone, while in the\r\nformer the living cell was enclosed in a siliceous case which does not\r\ndecompose, thus resembling more the fossils of animal shells.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacteria are so very minute that it is impossible to recognize them in\r\nordinary cases. In the matrix of the best-preserved fossils are always\r\nminute crystals and granules that may simulate bacterial shapes\r\nperfectly. _Bacillus_ and _Micrococcus_ of various species have been\r\ndescribed by French writers, but they do not carry conviction.\r\n\r\nAs was stated at the beginning of the chapter, from all the fossils of\r\nall the lower-plant families we cannot learn much of prime importance for\r\nthe present purpose. Yet, as the history of plants would be incomplete\r\nwithout mention of the little that is known, the foregoing pages have\r\nbeen added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n             FOSSIL PLANTS AS RECORDS OF ANCIENT COUNTRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe land which to-day appears so firm and unchanging has been under the\r\nsea many times, and in many different ways has been united to other land\r\nmasses to form continents. At each period, doubtless, the solid earth\r\nappeared as stable as it is now, while the country was as well\r\ncharacterized, and had its typical scenery, plants, and animals. We know\r\nwhat an important feature of the character of any present country is its\r\nflora; and we have no reason to suspect that it was ever less so than it\r\nis to-day. Indeed, in the ages before men interfered with forest growth,\r\nand built their cities, with their destructive influences, the plants\r\nwere relatively more important in the world landscape than they are\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nAs we go back in the periods of geological history we find the plants had\r\nan ever-increasing area of distribution. To-day most individual species\r\nand many genera are limited to islands or parts of continents, but before\r\nthe Glacial epoch many were distributed over both America and Europe. In\r\nthe Mesozoic _Ginkgo_ was spread all over the world, and in the present\r\nepoch it was confined to China and Japan till it was distributed again by\r\ncultivation; while in the Palæozoic period _Lepidodendron_ seemed to\r\nstretch wellnigh from pole to pole.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the relation of plant structure to the climate and\r\nlocal physical conditions under which it was growing cannot be too much\r\ninsisted upon. Modern biology and ecology are continually enlarging and\r\nrendering more precise our views of this interrelation, so that we can\r\nsafely search the details of anatomical structure of the fossil plants\r\nfor sidelights on the character of the countries they inhabited and their\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked already that most of the fossils which we have well\r\npreserved, whether of plants or animals, were fossilized in rocks which\r\ncollected under sea water; yet it was also noted that of marine plants we\r\nhave almost no reliable fossils at all. How comes this seeming\r\ncontradiction?\r\n\r\nThe lack of marine plant fossils probably depends on their easily\r\ndecomposable nature, while the presence of the numerous land plants\r\nresulted from their drifting out to sea in streams and rivers, or\r\ndropping into the still salt marshes where they grew. Hence, in the rocks\r\ndeposited in a sea, we have the plants preserved which grew on adjacent\r\nlands. In fresh water, also, the plants of the neighbourhood were often\r\nfossilized; but actually on the land itself but little was preserved. The\r\nwinds and rains and decay that are always at work on a land area tend to\r\nbreak down and wash away its surface, not to build it up.\r\n\r\nThere are many different details which are used in determining the\r\nevidence of a fossil plant. Where leaf impressions are preserved which\r\nexhibit a close similarity to living species (as often happens in the\r\nTertiary period), it is directly assumed that they lived under conditions\r\nlike those under which the present plants of that kind are living; while,\r\nif the anatomy is well preserved (as in the Palæozoic and several\r\nMesozoic types), we can compare its details with that of similar plants\r\ngrowing under known conditions, and judge of the climate that had\r\nnurtured the fossil plant while it grew.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the present period there was what is so well known as the\r\nGlacial epoch. In the earthy deposits of this age in which fossils are\r\nfound plants are not uncommon. They are of the same kind as those now\r\ngrowing in the cold regions of the Arctic circle, and on the heights of\r\nhills whose temperature is much lower than that of the surrounding\r\nlowlands. Glacial epochs occurred in other parts of the world at\r\ndifferent times; for example, in South Africa, in the Permo-Carboniferous\r\nperiod, during which time the fossils indicate that the warmth-loving\r\nplants were driven much farther north than is now the case.\r\n\r\nIt is largely from the nature of the plant fossils that we know the\r\nclimate of England at the time preceding the Glacial epoch. Impressions\r\nof leaves and stems, and even of fruits, are abundant from the various\r\nperiods of the Tertiary. Many of them were Angiosperms (see Chap. VIII),\r\nand were of the families and even genera which are now living, of which\r\nnot a few belong to the warm regions of the earth, and are subtropical.\r\nIt is generally assumed that the fossils related to, or identical with,\r\nthese plants must therefore have found in Tertiary Northern Europe a much\r\nwarmer climate than now exists. Not only in Northern Europe, but right up\r\ninto the Arctic circle, such plants occur in Tertiary rocks, and even if\r\nwe had not their living representatives with which to compare them, the\r\nlarge size and thin texture of their leaves, their smoothness, and a\r\nnumber of other characteristics would make it certain that the climate\r\nwas very much milder than it is at present, though the value of some of\r\nthe evidence has been overestimated.\r\n\r\nFrom the Tertiary we are dependent chiefly on impressions of fossils;\r\nanatomical structure would doubtless yield more details, but even as it\r\nis we have quite enough evidence to throw much light on the physiography\r\nof the Tertiary period. The causes for such marked changes of climate\r\nmust be left for the consideration of geologists and astronomers. Plants\r\nare passive, driven before great climatic changes, though they have a\r\nconsiderable influence on rainfall, as has been proved repeatedly in\r\nIndia in recent times.\r\n\r\nFrom the more distant periods it is the plants of the Carboniferous,\r\nwhose structure we know so well, that teach us most. Although there is\r\nstill very much to be done before knowledge is as complete as we should\r\nwish, there are sufficient facts now discovered to correct several\r\npopular illusions concerning the Palæozoic period. The “deep,\r\nall-enveloping mists, through which the sun’s rays could scarcely\r\npenetrate”, which have taken the popular imagination, appear to have no\r\nfoundation in fact. There is nothing in the actual structure of the\r\nplants to indicate that the light intensity of the climate in which they\r\ngrew was any less than it is in a smoke-free atmosphere to-day.\r\n\r\nLook at the “shade leaves” of any ordinary tree, such as a Lime or Maple,\r\nand compare them with those growing in the sunlight, even on the same\r\ntree. They are larger and softer and thinner. To absorb the same amount\r\nof energy as the more brilliantly lighted leaves, they must expose a\r\nlarger surface to the light. Hence if the Coal Measure plants grew in\r\nvery great shade, to supply their large growth with the necessary sun\r\nenergy we should expect to find enormous spreading leaves. But what is\r\nthe fact? No such large leaves are known. _Calamites_ and\r\n_Lepidodendron_, the commonest and most successful plants of the period,\r\nhad narrow simple leaves with but a small area of surface. They were, in\r\nfact, leaves of the type we now find growing in exposed places. The ferns\r\nhad large divided leaves, but they were finely lobed and did not expose a\r\nlarge continuous area as a true “shade leaf” does; while the height of\r\ntheir stems indicates that they were growing in partial shade—at least,\r\nthe shade cast by the small-leaved Calamites and Lepidodendrons which\r\novertopped them.\r\n\r\nIndeed there is no indication from geological evidence that so late as\r\nPalæozoic times there was any great abnormality of atmosphere, and from\r\nthe internal evidence of the plants then growing there is everything to\r\nindicate a dry or physiologically dry[14] sunny condition.\r\n\r\nOf the plant fossils from the Coal Measures we have at least two types.\r\nOne, those commonly found in nodules _in_ the coal itself; and the other,\r\nnodules in the rocks above the coal which had drifted from high lands\r\ninto the sea.\r\n\r\nThe former are the plants which actually formed the coal itself, and from\r\ntheir internal organization we see that these plants were growing with\r\npartly submerged roots in brackish swamps. Their roots are those of water\r\nplants (see p. 150, young root of Calamite), but their leaves are those\r\nof the “protected” type with narrow surface and various devices for\r\npreventing a loss of water by rapid transpiration. If the water they grew\r\nin had been fresh they would not have had such leaves, for there would\r\nhave been no need for them to economize their water, but, as we see in\r\nbogs and brackish or salt water to-day (which is physiologically usable\r\nin only small quantities by the plant), plants even partly submerged\r\nprotect their exposed leaves from transpiring largely.\r\n\r\nThere are details too numerous to mention in connection with these\r\ncoal-forming plants which go to prove that there were large regions of\r\nswampy ground near the sea where they were growing in a bright atmosphere\r\nand uniform climate. Extensive areas of coal, and geological evidence of\r\nstill more extensive deposits, show that in Europe in the Coal Measure\r\nperiod there were vast flats, so near the sea level that they were\r\nconstantly being submerged and appearing again as débris drifted and\r\ncollected over them. Such a land area must have differed greatly from the\r\nEurope now existing, in all its features. But the whole continent did not\r\nconsist of these flats; there were hills and higher ground, largely to\r\nthe north-east, on which a dry land flora grew, a flora where several of\r\nthe Pteridosperms and _Cordaites_ with its allies were the principal\r\nplants. These plants have leaves so organized as to suggest that they\r\ngrew in a region where the climate was bright and dry.\r\n\r\nA fossil flora which has aroused much interest, particularly among\r\ngeologists, is that known as the Glossopteris flora. This Palæozoic flora\r\nhas in general characters similar to those of the European\r\nPermo-Carboniferous, but it has special features of its own, in\r\nparticular the genus _Glossopteris_ and also the genera _Phyllotheca_ and\r\n_Schizoneura_.\r\n\r\nThese genera, with a few others, are characteristic of the\r\nPermo-Carboniferous period in the regions in the Southern Hemisphere now\r\nknown by the names of Australasia, South Africa, and South America, and\r\nin India. These regions, at that date, formed what is called by\r\ngeologists “Gondwanaland”. In the rocks below those containing the plants\r\nthere is evidence of glacial conditions, and it is not impossible that\r\nthis great difference in climate accounts for the differences which exist\r\nbetween the flora of the Gondwanaland region and the Northern Hemisphere.\r\nUnfortunately we have not microscopically preserved specimens of the\r\nGlossopteris flora, which could be compared with those of our own\r\nPalæozoic.[15]\r\n\r\nTo describe in detail the series of changes through which the seas and\r\ncontinents have passed belongs to the realm of pure geology. Here it is\r\nonly necessary to point out how the evidence from the fossil plants may\r\nafford much information concerning these continents, and as our knowledge\r\nof fossil anatomy and of recent ecology increases, their evidence will\r\nbecome still more weighty. Even now, had we no other sources of\r\ninformation, we could tell from the plants alone where in the past\r\ncontinents were snow and ice, heat and drought, swamps and hilly land.\r\nHowever different in their systematic position or scale of evolutional\r\ndevelopment, plants have always had similar minute structure and similar\r\nphysiological response to the conditions of climate and land surface, so\r\nthat in their petrified cells are preserved the histories of countries\r\nand conditions long past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the stupendous pageant of living things which moves through creation,\r\nthe plants have a place unique and vitally important. Yet so quietly and\r\nso slowly do they live and move that we in our hasty motion often forget\r\nthat they, equally with ourselves, belong to the living and evolving\r\norganisms. When we look at the relative structures of plants divided by\r\nlong intervals of time we can recognize the progress they make; and this\r\nis what we do in the study of fossil botany. We can place the salient\r\nfeatures of the flora of Palæozoic and Mesozoic eras in a few pages of\r\nprint, and the contrast becomes surprising. But the actual distance in\r\ntime between these two types of plants is immense, and must have extended\r\nover several million years; indeed to speak of years becomes meaningless,\r\nfor the duration of the periods must have been so vast that they pass\r\nbeyond our mental grasp. In these periods we find a contrast in the\r\ncharacters of the plants as striking as that in the characters of the\r\nanimals. Whole families died out, and new ones arose of more complex and\r\nadvanced organization. But in height and girth there is little difference\r\nbetween the earliest and the latest trees; there seems a limit to the\r\npossible size of plants on this planet, as there is to that of animals,\r\nthe height of mountains, or the depth of the sea. The “higher plants” are\r\noften less massive and less in height than the lower—Man is less in\r\nstature than was the Dinosaur—and though by no legitimate stretch of the\r\nimagination can we speak of brain in plants, there is an unconscious\r\nsuperiority of adaptation by which the more highly organized plants\r\ncapture the soil they dominate.\r\n\r\nIt has been noted in the previous chapters that so far back as the Coal\r\nMeasure period the vegetative parts of plants were in many respects\r\nsimilar to those of the present, it was in the reproductive organs that\r\nthe essential differences lay. Naturally, when a race (as all races do)\r\ndepends for its very existence on the chain of individuals leading from\r\ngeneration to generation, the most important items in the plant\r\nstructures must be those mechanisms concerned with reproduction. It is\r\nhere that we see the most fundamental differences between living and\r\nfossil plants, between the higher and the lower of those now living,\r\nbetween the forest trees of the present and the forest trees of the past.\r\nThe wood of the palæozoic Lycopods was in the quality and extent and\r\norigin of its secondary growth comparable with that of higher plants\r\nstill living to-day—yet in the fruiting organs how vast is the contrast!\r\nThe Lycopods, with simple cones composed of scales in whose huge\r\nsporangia were simple single-celled spores; the flowering plants, with\r\nmale and female sharply contrasted yet growing in the same cone (one can\r\nlegitimately compare a flower with a cone), surrounded by specially\r\ncoloured and protective scales, and with the “spore” in the tissue of the\r\nyoung seed so modified and changed that it is only in a technical sense\r\nthat comparison with the Lycopod spore is possible.\r\n\r\nTo study the minute details of fossil plants it is necessary to have an\r\nelaborate training in the structure of living ones. In the preceding\r\nchapters only the salient features have been considered, so that from\r\nthem we can only glean a knowledge similar to the picture of a house by a\r\nJapanese artist—a thing of few lines.\r\n\r\nEven from the facts brought together in these short chapters, however, it\r\ncannot fail to be evident how large a field fossil botany covers, and\r\nwith how many subjects it comes in touch. From the minute details of\r\nplant anatomy and evolution pure and simple to the climate of departed\r\ncontinents, and from the determination of the geological age of a piece\r\nof rock by means of a blackened fern impression on it to the chemical\r\nquestions of the preservative properties of sea water, all is a part of\r\nthe study of “fossil botany”.\r\n\r\nTo bring together the main results of the study in a graphic form is not\r\nan easy task, but it is possible to construct a rough diagram giving some\r\nindication of the distribution of the chief groups of plants in the main\r\nperiods of time (see fig. 122).\r\n\r\nSuch a diagram can only represent the present state of our imperfect\r\nknowledge; any day discoveries may extend the line of any group up or\r\ndown in the series, or may connect the groups together.\r\n\r\nIt becomes evident that so early as the Palæozoic there are nearly as\r\nmany types represented as in the present day, and that in fact\r\neverything, up to the higher Gymnosperms, was well developed (for it is\r\nhard indeed to prove that _Cordaites_ is less highly organized than some\r\nof the present Gymnosperm types), but flowering plants and also the true\r\ncycads are wanting, as well as the intermediate Mesozoic Bennettitales.\r\nThe peculiar groups of the period were the Pteridosperm series,\r\nconnecting links between fern and cycad, and the Sphenophyllums,\r\nconnecting in some measure the Lycopods and Calamites. With them some of\r\nthe still living groups of ferns, Lycopods, and Equisetaceæ were\r\nflourishing, though all the species differed from those now extant. This\r\nshows us how very far from the beginning our earliest information is, for\r\nalready in the Palæozoic we have a flora as diversified as that now\r\nliving, though with more primitive characters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 122.—Diagram showing the relative distribution of\r\n  the main groups of plants through the geological eras. The dotted lines\r\n  connecting the groups and those in the pre-Carboniferous are entirely\r\n  theoretical, and merely indicate the conclusions reached at present.\r\n  The size of the surface of each group roughly indicates the part it\r\n  played in the flora of each period. Those with dotted surface bore\r\n  seeds, the others spores.]\r\n\r\nIn Mesozoic times the most striking group is that of the Cycads and\r\nBennettitales, the latter branch suggesting a direct connection between\r\nthe fern-cycad series and the flowering plants. This view, so recently\r\npublished and upheld by various eminent botanists, is fast gaining\r\nground. Indeed, so popular has it become among the specialists that there\r\nis a danger of overlooking the real difficulties of the case. The\r\nmorphological leap from the leaves and stems of cycads to those of the\r\nflowering plants seems a much more serious matter to presuppose than is\r\nat present recognized.\r\n\r\nAs is indicated in the diagram, the groups do not appear isolated by\r\ngreat unbridged gaps, as they did even twenty years ago. By means of the\r\nfossils either direct connections or probable lines of connection are\r\ndiscovered which link up the series of families. At present the greatest\r\ngap now lies hedging in the Moss family, and, as was mentioned (p. 163),\r\nfossil botany cannot as yet throw much light on that problem owing to the\r\nlack of fossil mosses.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis glimpse into the past suggests a prophecy for the future. Evolution\r\nhaving proceeded steadily for such vast periods is not likely to stop at\r\nthe stage reached by the plants of to-day. What will be the main line of\r\nadvance of the plants of the future, and how will they differ from those\r\nof the present?\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the past how the differentiation of size in the spores\r\nresulted in sex, and in the higher plants in the modifications along\r\nwidely different lines of the male and female; how the large spore\r\n(female) became enclosed in protecting tissues, which finally led up to\r\ntrue seeds (see p. 75), while the male being so temporary had no such\r\nelaboration. As the seed advances it becomes more and more complex, and\r\nwhen we reach still higher plants further surrounding tissues are pressed\r\ninto its service and it becomes enclosed in the carpel of the highest\r\nflowering plants. After that the seed itself has fewer general duties,\r\nand instead of those of the Gymnosperms with large endosperms collecting\r\nfood before the embryo appears, small ovules suffice, which only develop\r\nafter fertilization is assured. The various families of flowering plants\r\nhave gone further, and the whole complex series of bracts and fertile\r\nparts which make up a flower is adapted to ensure the crossing of male\r\nand female of different individuals. The complex mechanisms which seem\r\nadapted for “cross fertilization” are innumerable, and are found in the\r\nhighest groups of the flowering plants. But some have gone beyond the\r\nstage when the individual flowers had each its device, and accomplished\r\nits seed-bearing independently of the other flowers on the same branch.\r\nThese have a combination of many flowers crowded together into one\r\ncommunity, in which there is specialization of different flowers for\r\ndifferent duties. In such a composite flower, the Daisy for example, some\r\nare large petalled and brightly coloured to attract the pollen-carrying\r\ninsects, some bear the male organs only, and others the female or\r\nseed-producing. Here, then, in the most advanced type of flowering plant\r\nwe get back again to the separation of the sexes in separate flowers; but\r\nthese flowers are combined in an organized community much more complex\r\nthan the cones of the Gymnosperms, for example, where the sexes are\r\nseparate on a lower plane of development.\r\n\r\nIt seems possible that an important group, if not the dominant group, of\r\nflowering plants in the future will be so organized that the individual\r\nflowers are very simple, with fewer parts than those of to-day, but that\r\nthey will be combined in communities of highly specialized individuals in\r\neach flower head or cluster.\r\n\r\nAs well as this, in other species the minute structure of the vital\r\norgans may show a development in a direction contrary to what has\r\nhitherto seemed advance. Until recently flowers and their organs have\r\nappeared to us to be specialized in the more advanced groups on such\r\nlines as encourage “cross fertilization”. In “cross fertilization”, in\r\nfact, has appeared to lie the secret of the strength and advance of the\r\nraces of plants. But modern cytologists have found that many of the\r\nplants long believed to depend on cross fertilization are either\r\nself-fertilized or not fertilized at all! They have passed through the\r\nperiod when their complex structures for ensuring cross fertilization\r\nwere used, and though they retain these external structures they have\r\ntaken to a simpler method of seed production, and in some cases have even\r\ndispensed with fertilization of the egg cell altogether. The female\r\nvitality increased, the male becomes superfluous. It is simpler and more\r\ndirect to breed with only one sex, or to use the pollen of the same\r\nindividual. Many flowers are doing this which until recently had not been\r\nsuspected of it. We cannot yet tell whether it will work successfully for\r\ncenturies to come or is an indication of “race senility”.\r\n\r\nWhether in the epochs to come flowering plants will continue to hold the\r\ndominant position which they now do is an interesting theoretical\r\nproblem. Flowers were evolved in correlation with insect pollination. One\r\ncan conceive of a future, when all the earth is under dominion of man, in\r\nwhich fruits will be sterilized for man’s use, as the banana is now, and\r\nseed formation largely replaced by gardeners’ “cuttings”.\r\n\r\nIn those plants which are now living where the complex mechanisms for\r\ncross-fertilization have been superseded by simple self-fertilization,\r\nthe external parts of the more elaborate method are still produced,\r\nthough they are apparently futile. In the future these vestigial organs\r\nwill be discarded, or developed in a more rudimentary form (for it is\r\nremarkable how organs that were once used by the race reappear in members\r\nof it that have long outgrown their use), and the morphology of the\r\nflower will be greatly simplified.\r\n\r\nThus we can foresee on both sides much simplified individual flowers—in\r\nthe one group the reduced individuals associating together in communities\r\nthe members of which are highly specialized, and in the other the\r\nsolitary flowers becoming less elaborate and conspicuous, as they no\r\nlonger need the assistance of insects (the cleistogamic flowers of the\r\nViolet, for example, even in the present day bend toward the earth, and\r\nlack all the bright attractiveness of ordinary flowers), and perhaps\r\nfinally developing underground, where the seeds could directly germinate.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetative organs less change is to be expected, the examples from\r\nthe past lead us to foresee no great difference in size or general\r\norganization of the essential parts, though the internal anatomy has\r\nvaried, and probably will vary, greatly with the whole evolution of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nBut one more point and we must have done. Why do plants evolve at all?\r\nWhy did they do so through the geological ages of the past, and why\r\nshould we expect them to do so in the future? The answer to this question\r\nmust be less assured than it might have been even twenty years ago, when\r\nthe magnetism of Darwin’s discoveries and elucidations seemed to obsess\r\nhis disciples. “Response to environment” is undoubtedly a potent factor\r\nin the course of evolution, but it is not the cause of it. There seems to\r\nbe something inherent in life, something apparently (though that may be\r\ndue to our incomplete powers of observation) apart from observable\r\nfactors of environment which causes slight spontaneous changes,\r\n_mutations_, and some individuals of a species will suddenly develop in a\r\nnew direction in one or other of their parts. If, then, this places them\r\nin a superior position as regards their environment or neighbours, it\r\npersists, but if not, those individuals die out. The work of a special\r\nbranch of modern botany seems clearly to indicate the great importance of\r\nthis seemingly inexplicable spontaneity of life. In environment alone the\r\nthoughtful student of the present cannot find incentive enough for the\r\ngreat changes and advances made by organisms in the course of the world’s\r\nhistory. The climate and purely physical conditions of the Coal Measure\r\nperiod were probably but little different from those in some parts of the\r\nworld to-day, but the plants themselves have fundamentally changed. True,\r\ntheir effect upon each other must be taken into account, but this is a\r\nless active factor with plants than with men, for we can imagine nothing\r\nequivalent to citizenship, society, and education in the plant\r\ncommunities, which are so vital in human development.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been proved that plants and animals may, at certain\r\nunknown intervals, “mutate”; and mutation is a fine word to express our\r\nrecent view of one of the essential factors in evolution. But it is a\r\ncloak for an ignorance avowedly less mitigated than when we thought to\r\nhave found a complete explanation of the causes of evolution in\r\n“environment”.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a sketch such as the present, outlines alone are possible, detail\r\ncannot be elaborated. If it has suggested enough of atmosphere to show\r\nthe vastness of the landscape spreading out before our eyes back into the\r\npast and on into the future, the task has been accomplished. There are\r\nmany detailed volumes which follow out one or other special line of\r\nenquiry along the highroads and by-ways of this long traverse in\r\ncreation. If the bird’s-eye view of the country given in this book\r\nentices some to foot it yard by yard under the guidance of specialists\r\nfor each district, it will have done its part. While to those who will\r\nmake no intimate acquaintance with so far off a land it presents a short\r\naccount by a traveller, so that they may know something of the main\r\nfeatures and a little of the romance of the fossil world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX I\r\n            LIST OF REQUIREMENTS FOR A COLLECTING EXPEDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain the best possible results from an expedition, it is\r\nwell to go fossil hunting in a party of two, four, or six persons. Large\r\nparties tend to split up into detachments, or to waste time in trying to\r\nkeep together.\r\n\r\nEach individual should have strong suitable clothes, with as many pockets\r\narranged in them as possible. The weight of the stones can thus be\r\ndistributed over the body, and is not felt so much as if they were all\r\ncarried in a knapsack. Each collector should also provide himself with—\r\n\r\n  A satchel or knapsack, preferably of leather or strong canvas, but not\r\n  of large size, for when the space is limited selection of the specimens\r\n  is likely to be made carefully.\r\n\r\n  One or two hammers. If only one is carried, it should be of a fair size\r\n  with a square head and strong straight edge.\r\n\r\n  One chisel, entirely of metal, and with a strong straight cutting edge.\r\n\r\n  Soft paper to wrap up the more delicate fossils, in order to prevent\r\n  them from scraping each other’s surfaces; and one or two small\r\n  cardboard boxes for very fragile specimens.\r\n\r\n  A map of the district (preferably geologically coloured). Localities\r\n  should be noted in pencil on this, indicating the exact spot of finds.\r\n  For general work the one-inch survey map suffices, but for detailed\r\n  work it is necessary to have the six-inch maps of important districts.\r\n\r\n  A small notebook. Few notes are needed, but those few _must_ be taken\r\n  on the spot to be reliable.\r\n\r\n  A pencil or fountain pen, preferably both.\r\n\r\n  A penknife, which, among other things, will be found useful for working\r\n  out very delicate fossils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX II\r\n                         TREATMENT OF SPECIMENS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The commonest form in which fossils are collected is that which has\r\nbeen described as _impression material_ (see p. 12). In many cases these\r\nwill need no further attention after the block of stone on which they lie\r\nhas been chipped into shape.\r\n\r\nIn chipping a block down to the size required it is best to hold it\r\nfreely in the left hand, protecting the actual specimen with the palm\r\nwhere possible, and taking the surplus edges away by means of short sharp\r\nblows from the hammer, striking so that only small pieces come away with\r\neach blow. For delicate specimens it is wise to leave a good margin of\r\nthe matrix round the specimen, and to do the final clearing with a\r\nthin-bladed penknife, taking away small flakes of the stone with delicate\r\ntaps on the handle of the knife.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from fine sandstones, shales, and limestones are usually\r\nthoroughly hard and resistant, and are then much better if left without\r\ntreatment; by varnishing and polishing them many amateur collectors spoil\r\ntheir specimens, for a coat of shiny varnish often conceals the details\r\nof the fossil itself. Impressions of plants on friable shales, on the\r\nother hand, or those which have a tendency to peel off as they dry, will\r\nrequire some treatment. In such cases the best substance to use is a\r\ndilute solution of size, in which the specimen should soak for a short\r\nperiod while the liquid is warm (not hot), after which it should be\r\nslightly drained and the size allowed to dry in. The congealed substance\r\nthen holds the plant film on to the rock surface and prevents the rock\r\nfrom crumbling away, while it is almost invisible and does not spoil the\r\nplant with any excessive glaze.\r\n\r\n2. For specimens of _casts_ the same treatment generally applies, though\r\nthey are more apt to separate completely from the matrix after one or two\r\nsharp blows, and thus save one the work of picking out the details of\r\ntheir structure.\r\n\r\n3. Those blocks which contain _petrifactions_, and can therefore be made\r\nto show microscopic details, will require much more treatment. In some\r\ncases mere polishing reveals much of the structure—such, for instance,\r\nwere the “Staarsteine” of the German lapidaries, where the axis and\r\nrootlets of a fossil like a treefern show their very characteristic\r\npattern distinctly.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, it is better, and for any detailed work it is\r\nessential, to cut thin sections transversely across and longitudinally\r\nthrough the axis of the specimen and to grind them down till they are so\r\ntransparent that they can be studied through the microscope. The cutting\r\ncan be done on a lapidary’s wheel, where a revolving metal disc set with\r\ndiamond powder acts as a knife. The comparatively thin slice thus\r\nobtained is fastened on to glass by means of hard Canada balsam, and\r\nrubbed down with carborundum powder till it is thin enough.\r\n\r\nThe process, however, is very slow, and an amateur cannot get good\r\nresults without spending a large amount of time and patience over the\r\nwork which would be better spent over the study of the plant structures\r\nthemselves. Therefore it is usually more economical to send specimens to\r\nbe cut by a professional, if they are good enough to be worth cutting at\r\nall, though it is often advisable to cut through an unpromising block to\r\nsee whether its preservation is such as would justify the expense.\r\n\r\nIn the case of true “coal balls” much can be seen on the cut surface of a\r\nblock, particularly if it be washed for a minute in dilute hydrochloric\r\nacid and then in water, and then dried thoroughly. The acid acts on the\r\ncarbonates of which the stone is largely composed, and the treatment\r\naccentuates the black-and-white contrast in the petrified tissues (see\r\nfig. 10). After lying about for a few months the sharpness of the surface\r\ngets rubbed off, as the acid eats it into very delicate irregularities\r\nwhich break and form a smearing powder; but in such a case all that is\r\nneeded to bring back the original perfection of definition is a quick\r\nwash of dilute acid and water. If the specimens are not rubbed at all the\r\nsurface is practically permanent. Blocks so treated reveal a remarkable\r\namount of detail when examined with a strong hand lens, and form very\r\nvaluable museum specimens.\r\n\r\nThe microscope slides should be covered with glass slips (as they would\r\nnaturally be if purchased), and studied under the microscope as sections\r\nof living plants would be.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic slides of fossils make excellent museum specimens when\r\nmounted as transparencies against a window or strong light, when a\r\nmagnifying glass will reveal all but the last minutiæ of their structure.\r\n\r\n4. _Labelling_ and numbering of specimens is very important, even if the\r\ncollection be but a small one. As well as the paper label giving full\r\ndetails, there should be a reference number on every specimen itself. On\r\nthe microscope slides this can be cut with a diamond pencil, and on the\r\nstones sealing wax dissolved in alcohol painted on with a brush is\r\nperhaps the best medium. On light-coloured close-textured stones ink is\r\ngood, and when quite dry can even be washed without blurring.\r\n\r\nThe importance of marking the stone itself will be brought home to one on\r\ngoing through an old collection where the paper labels have peeled or\r\nrubbed off, or their wording been obliterated by age or mould.\r\n\r\nA notebook should be kept in which the numbers are entered, with a note\r\nof all the items on the paper label, and any additional details of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX III\r\n                               LITERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nA short list of a few of the more important papers and books to which a\r\nstudent should refer. The innumerable papers of the specialists will be\r\nfound cited in these, so that, as they would be read only by advanced\r\nstudents, there is no attempt to catalogue them here.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarruthers, W., “On Fossil Cycadean Stems from the Secondary Rocks of\r\nBritain,” published in the _Transactions of the Linnean Society_, vol.\r\nxxvi, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Geikie, A., _A Text-Book of Geology_, vols. i and ii, London, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrand’Eury, C., “Flore Carbonifère du département de la Loire et du\r\ncentre de la France”, published in the _Mémoirs de l’Académie des\r\nSciences_, Paris, vol. xxiv, 1877.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Kidston, R., _Catalogue of the Palæozoic Plants in the Department of\r\nGeology and Palæontology of the British Museum_, London, 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Lapworth, C., _An Intermediate Text-Book of Geology_, twelfth edition,\r\nLondon, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\nLaurent, L., “Les Progrès de la paléobotanique angiospermique dans la\r\ndernière decade”, _Progressus Rei Botanicæ_, vol. i, Heft 2, pp. 319-68,\r\nJena, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nLindley, J., and Hutton, W., _The Fossil Flora of Great Britain_, 3\r\nvols., published in London, 1831-7.\r\n\r\n\r\nLyell, C., _Principles of Geology_ and _The Student’s Lyell_, edited by\r\nJ.

See p.\r\n25.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus.—A small group within a family which includes all the plants very\r\nlike each other, to which are all given the same “surname”; e.g. _Pinus\r\nmontana_, _Pinus sylvestris_, _Pinus Pinaster_, &c. &c., are all members\r\nof the genus _Pinus_, and would be called “pine trees” in general (see\r\n“Species”).\r\n\r\n\r\nHyphæ.—The delicate elongated cells of Fungi.\r\n\r\n\r\nMolecule.—The group of chemical elements, in a definite proportion, which\r\nis the basis of any compound substance; _e.g._ two atoms of hydrogen and\r\none atom of oxygen form a molecule of water, H_2O. A lime carbonate\r\nmolecule (see definition of “Carbonate”) is represented as CaCO_3.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonostelic.—A type of stem that contains only one stele.\r\n\r\n\r\nMorphology.—The study of the features of plants, their shapes and\r\nrelations, and the theories regarding the origin of the organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nNucellus.—The tissue in a Gymnosperm seed in which the large “spore”\r\ndevelops. See figs. 55 and 56, p. 76.\r\n\r\n\r\nNucleus.—The more compact mass of protoplasm in the centre of each living\r\ncell, which controls its growth and division. See fig. 17, _n._\r\n\r\n\r\nPalæobotany.—The study of fossil plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nPalæontology.—The study of fossil organisms, both plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetiole.—The stalk of a leaf, which attaches it to the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhloem.—Commonly called “bast”. The elongated vessel-like cells which\r\nconduct the manufactured food. See p. 57.\r\n\r\n\r\nPollen Chamber.—The cavity inside a Gymnosperm seed in which the pollen\r\ngrains rest for some time before giving out the male cells which\r\nfertilize the egg-cell in the seed. See p. 76.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolystelic.—A type of stem that appears, in any transverse section, to\r\ncontain several steles. See note on the use of the word on p. 63.\r\n\r\n\r\nProtoplasm.—The colourless, constantly moving mass of finely granulated,\r\njelly-like substance, which is the essentially living part of both plants\r\nand animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nRock.—Used by a geologist for all kinds of earth layers. Clay, and even\r\ngravel, are “rocks” in a geological sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nRoof, of a coal seam. The layers of rock—usually shale, limestone, or\r\nsandstone—which lie just above the coal. See p. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\nSclerenchyma.—Cells with very thick walls, specially modified for\r\nstrengthening the tissues. See fig. 28, p. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeed.—Essentially consisting of a young embryo and the tissues round it,\r\nwhich are enclosed in a double coat. See definition of “Fruit”.\r\n\r\n\r\nShale.—A fine-grained soft rock, formed of dried and pressed mud or silt,\r\nwhich tends to split into thin sheets, on the surface of which fossils\r\nare often found.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies.—Individuals which in all essentials are identical are said to be\r\nof the same species. As there are many variations which are not\r\nessential, it is sometimes far from easy to draw the boundary between\r\nactual species. The specific name comes after that of the genus, e.g.\r\n_Pinus montana_ is a species of the genus _Pinus_, as is also _Pinus\r\nsylvestris_. See “Genus”.\r\n\r\n\r\nSporangium.—The saclike case which contains the spores. See figs. 52 and\r\n53, p. 75.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpore.—A single cell (generally protected by a cell wall) which has the\r\npower of germinating and reproducing the plant of which it is the\r\nreproductive body. See p. 75.\r\n\r\n\r\nSporophyll.—A leaf or part of a leaf which bears spores or seeds, and\r\nwhich may be much or little modified.\r\n\r\n\r\nStele.—A strand of vascular tissue completely enclosed in an endodermis.\r\nSee p. 62.\r\n\r\n\r\nStigma.—A special protuberance of the carpel in flowering plants which\r\ncatches the pollen grains.\r\n\r\n\r\nStomates.—Breathing pores in the epidermis, which form as a space between\r\ntwo curved liplike cells. See fig. 23, p. 54.\r\n\r\n\r\nTetrads.—Groups of four cells which develop by the division of a single\r\ncell called the “mother cell”. Spores and pollen grains are nearly always\r\nformed in this way. See p. 75.\r\n\r\n\r\nTracheid.—A cell specially modified for conducting or storing of water,\r\noften much elongated. The long wood cells of Ferns and Gymnosperms are\r\ntracheids.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderclay.—The fine clay found immediately below some coal seams. See p.\r\n24.\r\n\r\n\r\nVascular Tissue.—The elongated cells which are specialized for conduction\r\nof water and semifluid foodstuffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]My book was entirely written before the second edition of Scott’s\r\n    _Studies_ appeared, which, had it been available, would have tempted\r\n    me to escape some of the labour several of the chapters of this\r\n    little book involved.\r\n\r\n[2]The student would do well to read up the general geology of this very\r\n    interesting subject. Such books as Lyell’s _Principles of Geology_,\r\n    Geikie’s textbooks, and many others, provide information about the\r\n    process of “mountain building” on which the form of our coalfields\r\n    depends. A good elementary account is to be found in Watt’s _Geology\r\n    for Beginners_, p. 96 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[3]See note on p. 28.\r\n\r\n[4]This refers only to the “coal-ball”-bearing seams; there are many\r\n    other coals which have certainly collected in other ways. See Stopes\r\n    & Watson, Appendix, p. 187.\r\n\r\n[5]For a detailed list of the strata refer to Watts, p. 219 (see\r\n    Appendix).\r\n\r\n[6]Though the Angiosperm was not then evolved, the Gymnosperm stem has\r\n    distinct vascular bundles arranged as are those of the Angiosperm,\r\n    the difference here lies in the type of wood cells.\r\n\r\n[7]The gametophyte generation (represented in the ferns by the\r\n    prothallium on which the sexual organs develop) alternates with the\r\n    large, leafy sporophyte. Refer to Scott’s volume on _Flowerless\r\n    Plants_ (see Appendix) for an account of this alternation of\r\n    generations.\r\n\r\n[8]Material recently obtained by the author and Dr. Fujii in Japan does\r\n    contain some true petrifactions of Angiosperms and other plant\r\n    debris. The account of these discoveries has not yet been published.\r\n\r\n[9]A fuller account of the Angiospermic flora can be had in French, in M.\r\n    Laurent’s paper in _Progressus Rei Botanicæ_. See Appendix for\r\n    reference.\r\n\r\n[10]From the Cretaceous deposits of North America several fossil forms\r\n    (_Brachyphyllum_, _Protodammara_) are described which show clear\r\n    affinities with the family as it is now constituted. (See Hollick and\r\n    Jeffrey; reference in the Appendix.)\r\n\r\n[11]The addition of _-oxylon_ to the generic name of any living type\r\n    indicates that we are dealing with a fossil which closely resembles\r\n    the living type so far as we have information from the petrified\r\n    material.\r\n\r\n[12]See reference in the Appendix to this richly illustrated volume.\r\n\r\n[13]For fuller description of this interesting cone, see Scott’s\r\n    _Studies_, p. 114 _et seq._\r\n\r\n[14]A brackish swampy land is physiologically dry, as the plants cannot\r\n    use the water. See Warming’s _Oecology of Plants_, English edition,\r\n    for a detailed account of such conditions. For a simple account see\r\n    Stopes’ _The Study of Plant Life_, p. 170.\r\n\r\n[15]The student interested in this special flora should refer to Arber’s\r\n    British Museum _Catalogue of the Fossil Plants of the Glossopteris\r\n    Flora_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n             (_Italicized numbers refer to illustrations_)\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abietineæ, 88, 89, 90.\r\n  — family characters of, 91.\r\n  Algæ, 44, 47, 165.\r\n  — brown, 166.\r\n  — green, 165.\r\n  — red, 165.\r\n  _Alnus_, 85.\r\n  Amber, 17.\r\n  Amentiferæ, 84.\r\n  Anatomy of fossil plants, likeness in detail to that of living plants,\r\n          53 et seq.\r\n  — — — — differences in detail from that of living plants, 69 et seq.\r\n  _Andromeda_, 84.\r\n  Angiosperms, comparison with Bennettitales, 103.\r\n  — early history of, 79 et seq.\r\n  — general distribution of in time, 177.\r\n  — later evolution of, 178.\r\n  — male cell of, 52.\r\n  Araliaceæ, 85.\r\n  Araucareæ, 88, 90, 111.\r\n  — description of, 90.\r\n  — primitive characters of, 89.\r\n  _Araucarioxylon_, 93, 95.\r\n  Arber, 173.\r\n  _Archæocalamites_, 152.\r\n  Artocarpaceæ, 85.\r\n  _Asterochlaena_, 126, 127, _86_, _89_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Bacillus_, 167.\r\n  Bacteria, 167.\r\n  _Baiera_, 101.\r\n  Bast, 57, _32_.\r\n  Bennettitales, 44, 102, 131.\r\n  — general distribution of in time, 177.\r\n  _Bennettites_, 103 et seq.\r\n  — external appearance of, 103.\r\n  — flower-like nature of fructification, 108.\r\n  — fructification of, 104, _71_, 105, _72_.\r\n  — seed of, 106, _73_.\r\n  Bertrand, 2.\r\n  _Betula_, 85.\r\n  _Bignonia_, 84.\r\n  Botryopterideæ, 125, 132.\r\n  — description of group, 125.\r\n  — fructifications of, 128.\r\n  — petioles of, 127, _89_.\r\n  — stem anatomy of, 126, _86_, _87_.\r\n  — wood of, 128, _90_.\r\n  _Botryopteris_, 126, 127.\r\n  — axis with petiole, 127, _88_, _89_.\r\n  _Bowmanites Römeri_, 158, 160.\r\n  _Brachyphyllum_, 89.\r\n  Brongniart, 2.\r\n  Bryophytes, 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Calamites_, 147, 154, 157, 159, 160, 171.\r\n  — branch of, 147, _104_.\r\n  — _casheana_, 152.\r\n  — cone of, 150, _109_, 151, _110_.\r\n  — leaf of, 149, _107_.\r\n  — node of, 149, _106_.\r\n  — spores of, 152, _111_.\r\n  — young roots of, 150, _108_.\r\n  — young stem of, 148, _105_.\r\n  Cambium, 57, _33_, 65, _43_, 66, _44_.\r\n  Carbon, film of representing decayed plant, 12.\r\n  Carbonate of magnesium, 20.\r\n  Carbonates of lime, 19.\r\n  Carpels, modified leaves, 78.\r\n  Carruthers, 186.\r\n  Casts of fossil plants, 8, 9, _2_, 10, _3_, _4_, 11, 12.\r\n  — of seeds, 11, 12.\r\n  — treatment of specimens of, 184.\r\n  _Casuarina_, 83.\r\n  Cells, similarity of living and fossil types of, 53.\r\n  — principal types of, 53 et seq., _22_-_33_.\r\n  Cell wall, 47, _17_.\r\n  Centrifugal wood, 97, _65_.\r\n  Centripetal wood, 97, _65_, 116.\r\n  _Chara_, 16.\r\n  Characeæ, 163.\r\n  _Cheirostrobus_, 159, _118_, 160.\r\n  Chloroplast, 47, _17_.\r\n  Coal, origin of, 29 et seq.\r\n  — of different ages, 33.\r\n  — seams in the rocks, 24, _13_, _14_.\r\n  — vegetable nature of, 25 et seq.\r\n  — importance of, 17, Chap.
