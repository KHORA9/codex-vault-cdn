The early white settlers\r\nwere of different nationalities,--Dutch, Swedes, English, and French.\r\nThe geographical names of the state are interesting reminders of the\r\nvarious occupants.\r\n\r\nThe first exploration of the state was made by Henry Hudson, who, in\r\nthe employ of the Dutch East India Company, sailed for a week in 1609\r\non the waters of Delaware Bay and Delaware River, which the Dutch\r\ncalled South River, in search of a northwest passage to India. Failing\r\nto find it, he sailed north and entered New York Bay and Hudson River,\r\nor North River, as it is still called. In 1614 the Dutch founded New\r\nAmsterdam, afterwards New York, and, about the same time, established a\r\ntrading post in what is now Hudson County. Later the Swedes attempted\r\nsettlements in the southwestern part of the state, but were expelled by\r\nthe Dutch. The Dutch made settlements at various places, some of which\r\nproved to be only temporary. The first permanent settlement in New\r\nJersey was at Bergen, now a part of Jersey City, to which was granted a\r\ntown form of government, separate from that of New Amsterdam, in 1660.\r\n\r\nIn 1664 the English took possession of New Netherland--the Dutch Colony\r\nincluding New York and New Jersey, King Charles II granted it to his\r\nbrother, the Duke of York, who in turn granted that part of it lying\r\nbetween the Hudson and Delaware rivers to Lord John Berkeley and Sir\r\nGeorge Carteret. The latter had been governor of the Isle of Jersey,\r\nand their new grant was named New Jersey in his honor. Disagreements\r\nbetween Carteret and Berkeley led the latter to sell his interest to\r\nother proprietors, among whom afterwards was William Penn. In 1676 the\r\ncolony was divided into East Jersey and West Jersey by a line running\r\nfrom Little Egg Harbor to the Delaware in the northern part of the\r\nstate. It is because of this division that the state is still often\r\nreferred to as \"the Jerseys.\" In 1702 the proprietors surrendered their\r\nproprietary rights to the crown. From that time to its independence the\r\nwhole of New Jersey was under royal government.\r\n\r\nFive representatives from New Jersey signed the Declaration of\r\nIndependence. The position of the state made it \"The War Path of the\r\nRevolution.\" Paulus Hook, Springfield, Morristown, Monmouth, Princeton,\r\nand Trenton are famous names in Revolutionary history. The troops of\r\nthe state were in every conflict. In the army of General Wayne, which\r\npunished the Indians after the Wyoming massacre, one third were New\r\nJersey soldiers under General Maxwell.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trenton Battle Monument]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Physical and Political New Jersey (north half)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Physical and Political New Jersey (south half)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSITION AND SIZE\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Jersey lies between 73° 55′ and 75° 32′ west longitude and between\r\n38° 56′ and 41° 21′ north latitude. Its northernmost point is marked by\r\na rock on the shore of the Delaware River just south of Port Jervis,\r\nNew York, known as Tri-States Rock. From this point to Cape May the\r\nlength of the state is 166 miles. Its narrowest part, between Trenton\r\nand Raritan Bay, is 335 miles wide. Its widest part, measured on a line\r\nextending northwest from Great Egg Inlet, is 57 miles wide.\r\n\r\nIt is the smallest of the Middle Atlantic states and has an area of\r\n8224 square miles, of which 7514 square miles are land surface and 710\r\nsquare miles are water surface. It is the forty-fifth of the states in\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a general way the surface of New Jersey may be described as\r\nmountainous in the northern part, undulating in the middle part, and\r\nlow and sandy in the southern part. The state is divided into four\r\nprovinces or zones; namely, the Appalachian zone, the Highlands, the\r\nPiedmont Plateau, and the Coastal Plain. These zones extend from\r\nsouthwest to northeast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tri-States Rock in the Delaware River. The rock on which\r\nthe man stands is at the intersection of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nNew York boundaries]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Topographic provinces of New Jersey]\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian zone, which consists of Kittatinny Mountain and\r\nKittatinny Valley, extends across the northwestern part of the state\r\nfrom the Delaware River in the vicinity of the Delaware Water Gap to\r\nthe New York state line. The width of this belt varies from twelve to\r\nfourteen miles. The Kittatinny Mountain extends along the Delaware\r\nRiver for thirty miles in the northwestern corner of the state. It\r\nextends into Pennsylvania, where it is known as Blue Mountain. The\r\nheight of this range varies from 1500 feet to 1800 feet. Its highest\r\npoint and the highest in the state is High Point, which has an\r\nelevation of 1804 feet. The Kittatinny Valley is on the southeast side\r\nof Kittatinny Mountain and runs parallel with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Relief map of New Jersey]\r\n\r\nThe Appalachian zone, with its rugged surface, extensive forests, and\r\nmany lakes, is noted for its beautiful scenery, which attracts many\r\nsummer visitors. The Delaware Water Gap is particularly noted on this\r\naccount. This is a break in the Kittatinny Mountain through which the\r\nDelaware River flows. Because of the rough surface this section of\r\nthe state is not adapted to agriculture, although on the bottom lands\r\nbordering on the streams and in the Kittatinny Valley there are many\r\nfarms devoted to the raising of crops and to grazing.\r\n\r\nThe second zone, The Highlands, immediately southeast of the\r\nAppalachian zone, extends from the Delaware River into New York. Its\r\nsoutheastern boundary passes near Morristown and Boonton. This zone\r\nis from ten to twenty miles wide. Its height generally varies from\r\n900 feet to 1400 feet. Hamburg Mountain and Wawayanda Mountain reach\r\nan altitude of 1469 feet. The Highlands, as well as the Appalachian\r\nzone, belong to the Appalachian region, but in New Jersey the term\r\n\"Appalachian\" is applied only to the region consisting of Kittatinny\r\nMountain and Valley.\r\n\r\nThe Highlands contain many irregular mountain masses, interspersed with\r\nfertile valleys, and much forest land. The zone contains, besides, many\r\nlakes, most of which are of glacial origin. The section is consequently\r\none of great natural beauty, and is a popular resort for many who\r\ndesire out-door recreation. There is much fertile farm land and land\r\nsuitable for grazing. Parts of it are specially suitable for the\r\nraising of peaches and other fruits. It contains many valuable mineral\r\ndeposits, including gravel, cement rock, zinc, and iron.\r\n\r\nNext to the Highlands and parallel with it is the Piedmont Plateau.\r\nThis extends from the Delaware River to the northeast corner of the\r\nstate and is about thirty miles wide. Its southeastern boundary is a\r\nline running from Trenton to Woodbridge in Middlesex County, which\r\nrepresents in this state the Fall Line (Sec. 47). It comprises about\r\none fifth of the area of the state. Its elevation varies from sea level\r\nto about 900 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Piedmont Plateau is characterized by the presence of red sandstone\r\nand shale. Its surface is very irregular. In its eastern part it is\r\nundulating or rolling. In the western, it contains higher lands which\r\nmay be called plateaus. It contains also irregular ridges such as\r\nthe Watchung Mountains, the Palisades, and the mountains in Hunterdon\r\nCounty. The Watchung Mountains and the Palisades are composed of trap\r\nrock, which in a molten condition was forced up through overlying rock\r\nstrata. The eastern sides of these trap ridges are steep slopes. The\r\nunderlying sandstone has been worn away while the harder trap rock has\r\nresisted erosion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Palisades of the Hudson]\r\n\r\nThe Falls of the Passaic River at Paterson are located in this section.\r\nThese falls, which are seventy feet high, were formed by the water\r\npassing over the hard trap rock and wearing away the softer rock below.\r\n\r\nBecause of the nearness of the Piedmont Plateau to the great commercial\r\ncenters of the country and the excellent facilities for transportation,\r\nmost of the larger cities of the state are located in this zone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barnegat lighthouse]\r\n\r\nThe fourth zone, the Coastal Plain, includes the remainder of the state\r\nsouth and east of the Fall Line. The land of this zone is highest\r\nin the interior along a range of elevations extending from Atlantic\r\nHighlands in the northeast to Mount Holly in the southwest, and slopes\r\noutward from these elevations towards the margins of the zone. The\r\ngreatest elevation is 390 feet, which is found in Monmouth County.\r\nAbout three fourths of this portion of the state has an elevation of\r\nless than 100 feet and about one third has an elevation of less than 50\r\nfeet. The Coastal Plain is bordered along Delaware Bay and the Atlantic\r\nCoast by salt marshes, or tidal marshes, often called salt meadows,\r\nwhose elevation above sea level is rarely as much as four feet. The\r\ntotal area of these marshes, including those of the valley of the\r\nHackensack River, is almost 660 square miles. Along the Atlantic coast\r\nthe marshes are separated from the ocean by beaches. These are low\r\nridges of sand, constructed in the shallow water by the action of the\r\nwaves and wind. These beaches are absent along the shore of Delaware\r\nBay and along the coast from Manasquan to Monmouth Beach. The water\r\nbetween the beaches and the mainland is shallow and is becoming more\r\nshallow because of the deposit of sediment which is washed down from\r\nthe land by streams.\r\n\r\nAlthough the coast line of the state along the Atlantic is 120 miles\r\nlong, there are no good harbors on this line, because of the barrier\r\nbeaches and the shallowness of the water between the beaches and the\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\nThe northern fourth of New Jersey was covered by ice during the Glacial\r\nPeriod (Sec. 32). It therefore contains many moraines, or deposits of\r\nmaterial carried along by the glacier. These deposits consist of clay,\r\nsand, gravel, and bowlders. In some places they take the form of hills\r\nor ridges, in others they are spread out as level sheets. Some valleys\r\nare partly filled by them. Many lakes in the northern part of the state\r\noccupy basins which were scooped out by the glacier, or were formed\r\nfrom river valleys whose outlets were blocked by glacial deposits. The\r\nterminal moraine which marks the southern limit of the glacier extends\r\nfrom Belvidere, through Morristown, to Perth Amboy. As the ice passed\r\nover the hard rocks of the mountains it polished their surfaces, and\r\nleft in them scratches, which indicate the general southward movement\r\nof the glacier.\r\n\r\nThe Coastal Plain was once beneath the ocean and was part of the\r\ncontinental shelf which extends along the Atlantic. The ancient shore\r\nis now the Fall Line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe climate of New Jersey is milder and less subject to extreme\r\nfluctuation than that of the interior states in the same latitude,\r\nbecause it extends along the ocean (Sec. 107). The average annual\r\ntemperature of New Jersey is 51.5°. The average annual temperature of\r\nthe extreme northern part is 5° lower than that of the extreme southern\r\nend of the state. The lower temperature of the northern part of the\r\nstate is due to the higher latitude, its distance from the ocean, and\r\nits greater altitude.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing winds are from the west and northwest. New Jersey is in\r\nthe track of storms, which cross the continent from the west. The south\r\nand east winds blowing from the ocean toward the storm centers bring\r\nwith them much moisture and insure the state an ample rainfall. Local\r\nshowers or thunderstorms which move from the west or northwest are\r\nfrequent in the spring and summer months. In the summer time all along\r\nthe coast the benefit of sea breezes is felt (Sec. 372).\r\n\r\nThe rainfall is sufficient for all kinds of crops which can be grown in\r\nthe state. It is greatest in the northeastern part of the state, where\r\nthe annual precipitation is more than fifty inches; and least in the\r\nsouthern and southwestern part along Delaware Bay, where it is about\r\nforty-one inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sandy Hook from the Highland Light]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drainage basins in New Jersey]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe divide between the streams that flow into the Delaware River and\r\nDelaware Bay on the west and those that flow into the Hudson River,\r\nNewark Bay, New York Bay, Raritan Bay, Sandy Hook Bay, and Atlantic\r\nOcean on the east is a very irregular line extending from the northwest\r\ncorner of the state to Cape May. It is so near the Delaware River and\r\nDelaware Bay that only a little more than one third of the state is\r\ndrained into these waters. The tributaries which drain this basin are,\r\ntherefore, small. The eastern drainage area contains several rivers\r\nof considerable size. The Wallkill River flows northeast through the\r\nnorthwestern part of this state and through the southeast corner of\r\nNew York into the Hudson River. The Hackensack River rises in New\r\nYork and flows south into Newark Bay. The Passaic River, which has as\r\ntributaries Saddle River, Pompton River, Ramapo River, Wanaque River\r\nwith Greenwood Lake, Pequannock River, and Rockaway River, follows\r\na very tortuous course and flows into Newark Bay. Just north of the\r\nmiddle of the state is the Raritan River, which rises near the Delaware\r\nRiver and flows into Raritan Bay.\r\n\r\nAll the rivers which flow into the Atlantic Ocean or into the bays\r\nwhich border the state are affected by the tidal flow, and the largest\r\nare navigable for at least some parts of their courses. In the case\r\nof the Delaware the tide extends to Trenton. Important cities which\r\nare located on tidal waters are Hoboken, Jersey City, Bayonne, Newark,\r\nElizabeth, New Brunswick, Perth Amboy, Long Branch, Asbury Park,\r\nAtlantic City, Camden, and Trenton.\r\n\r\nBetween the Watchung Mountains on the east and south and the Highlands\r\non the northwest is a broad, flat basin, which is drained by the\r\nPassaic River. Before the Glacial Period the Passaic River did not flow\r\nfrom this basin through the mountains at Little Falls and Paterson, as\r\nit does now. This area was then drained by a stream which crossed the\r\nWatchung Mountains near Summit and Millburn and flowed southeast into\r\nthe sea. During the Glacial Period most of this basin was covered by\r\nthe ice sheet. As the ice receded, this gap in the Watchung Mountains\r\nwas filled with glacial drift and there was formed a large lake, which\r\nthe geologists call Lake Passaic and which was drained for a long time\r\nby a stream which flowed southwest through the hills near Liberty\r\nCorner into the Raritan River. As the ice sheet receded still farther\r\nnorth, the gaps through the mountains at Little Falls and Paterson were\r\nexposed. As these gaps are lower than the older outlets, the water\r\nof Lake Passaic escaped through them over the present course of the\r\nPassaic River to Newark Bay, and the lake disappeared. These changes in\r\nthe drainage of the Passaic basin explain the presence of much swampy\r\nland in this section.\r\n\r\nThe water power generated by the rapid descent of the streams in the\r\npart of the state lying north of the Fall Line has long been utilized\r\nfor manufacturing purposes, and mills are found along all the streams\r\nin this part of the state. The location of Paterson as a manufacturing\r\ncenter is due to the water power developed from the Passaic Falls. At\r\nTrenton, water power is secured from the rapids of the Delaware River.\r\nIn the northern part of the state, several streams and lakes are used\r\nto provide electric power and light.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with drainage systems and dependent largely upon them\r\nare the methods of supplying water to the people of towns and cities\r\nfor domestic purposes. Formerly water for such purposes was obtained\r\nfrom near-by springs, wells, and streams. As population increased,\r\nthe local sources of water supply became contaminated and dangerous\r\nto health. This danger and the larger quantity of water required by\r\nthe increased population and by manufacturing interests have forced\r\nthe larger cities to make provision for securing their water supply\r\nfrom sources, more or less remote, which are not subject to pollution.\r\nTheir water-supply systems include pumping stations, reservoirs for\r\nstorage, and long pipe lines. The drainage basins from which water is\r\ntaken for municipal purposes are located in the thinly populated parts\r\nof the state. The northern mountainous section, which is not specially\r\nprofitable for agriculture and other purposes, is particularly useful\r\nin furnishing sources of water supply. The many large cities in the\r\nnorthern part of the state draw their water from the upper parts of the\r\nHackensack, Passaic, and Raritan basins. Formerly Newark and Jersey\r\nCity drew their water from the Passaic River not far above the former\r\ncity. This river was gradually so polluted by the sewage and the waste\r\nof factories discharged into it, that it had to be abandoned as a\r\nsource of supply. These cities now bring their water long distances,\r\nNewark using the Pequannock basin, and Jersey City the Rockaway. In\r\nsome cases water is obtained from artesian wells.\r\n\r\nThe pollution of streams by city sewers and drains from factories\r\ndestroys fish in fresh-water streams. The damage extends even into\r\ntidal waters, and many oyster and clam fisheries in the bays have\r\nbeen abandoned. The state is alive to the necessity of protecting its\r\nstreams against contamination of all kinds and has enacted legislation\r\ndesigned to maintain their purity by preventing the flow of sewage\r\nand other objectionable matter into them. It has provided for the\r\nconstruction of a trunk-line sewer along the valley of the Passaic from\r\nPaterson to the sea, into which the sewers of the cities along its\r\ncourse will be discharged. In cooperation with Pennsylvania the state\r\nhas passed laws to prevent the pollution of the Delaware River.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTS AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Forests.=--When the state was first settled it was covered with a vast\r\nprimeval forest, consisting of pine, oak, maple, chestnut, hickory,\r\nash, walnut, tulip, poplar, and cedar. For many years lumbering was\r\nan important industry, but it ceased a long time ago, after the best\r\ntimber had been cut down. In the northern part of the state, where\r\nagriculture is difficult or impossible, the mountains are still covered\r\nwith forests which promise to be of great value in the future. In the\r\nsouthern part, the section called \"The Pines\" is covered with stunted\r\npines mingled with scrub oak. In all parts of the state are isolated\r\nforested areas of varied extent. About forty per cent of the total land\r\nsurface of the state is covered with forest growth.\r\n\r\nUntil a very recent period no organized efforts were made to protect\r\nforest trees against forest fires or other destructive agencies, or\r\nto provide for reforestation. The state has, however, realized the\r\ncommercial value of its forests and the importance of promoting their\r\ngrowth on lands that are not available for farming purposes. The\r\nstate has also recognized the value of forests in preventing floods\r\n(Secs. 93, 136, 224). In recent years an additional reason for forest\r\nprotection is the necessity of preserving the soils of the forested\r\nareas in the drainage basins from which the cities obtain their supply\r\nof water, so that by the storage of water in the soils and underlying\r\nrock strata the supply may at all times be constant and sufficient.\r\nThe use of trees for shade and wind breaks and their natural beauty\r\nalso justify their protection and care. For these reasons the state has\r\nadopted legislation which provides for the growth of trees and forests.\r\nIt owns and maintains six forest reserves located in different parts\r\nof the state, containing nearly 14,000 acres, which are being devoted\r\nto forest culture. It has authorized the counties to create extensive\r\nparks and has provided for the diffusion of important information\r\nregarding the care of forests. It maintains lookout stations from which\r\nforest fires may be detected, and a force of firewardens to prevent or\r\nextinguish fires and to arrest those who cause them. This state and\r\nNew York, acting together, have created the Palisades Interstate Park,\r\nwhich embraces thousands of acres of forest land in the latter state\r\nand the Palisades for a distance of twelve miles along the Hudson in\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shipping tomatoes, Swedesboro]\r\n\r\n=Animals.=--The larger wild animals have practically disappeared,\r\nalthough the red deer is still frequently found in the northern and\r\nsouthern parts of the state because of the protection afforded this\r\nanimal by the laws. Here are, also, still many of the smaller animals,\r\nsuch as the rabbit and squirrel. In many parts of the state wild ducks\r\nand quail are numerous.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water streams and lakes abound in bass, trout, pickerel, and\r\nperch. In the spring the shad fisheries along the Delaware are very\r\nprofitable. The catch of sturgeon is also very large. All these waters\r\nare constantly restocked by means of the hatcheries near Hackettstown\r\nwhich the state maintains. The shad fisheries of the Hudson were\r\nformerly extensive, but owing chiefly to destructive methods of fishing\r\nand to the pollution of the river this industry has practically\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nThe sheltered bays and inlets of the state and the nearness of the\r\nfisheries to the markets have made the salt water fisheries very\r\nsuccessful. Bluefish and weakfish for food, and menhaden for oil and\r\nfertilizer are caught along the coast in large quantities, while\r\nin the bays and coves immense quantities of oysters and clams are\r\ngathered. Important centers of this industry are Keyport, Barnegat Bay,\r\nTuckerton, Absecon, Maurice River Cove, and Bivalve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n=Soils.=--In the northern part of the state the sides of the higher\r\nmountains are steep and are in many places denuded of soil. In the\r\nvalleys and on the hills north of the terminal moraine the soil\r\nconsists largely of glacial drift, which is composed of clay, sand,\r\nand gravel mixed with bowlders. This soil is fertile, but a large part\r\nof it is not easy to cultivate, because of the large stones in It and\r\nbecause of the rugged surface. South of the terminal moraine, in the\r\nHighlands and in the Piedmont Plateau, the soil is composed of gravel\r\nand sand washed down by streams from the glacial deposits farther north\r\nand of disintegrated underlying rocks, which in the Highlands consisted\r\nlargely of gneiss and in the Piedmont Plateau of sandstones and shales.\r\nThe soil of the Coastal Plain consists of extensive deposits of gravel,\r\nsand, clay, and marl deposited in the ocean, which once covered this\r\nregion. The gravel, sand, and clay were carried into it by the streams\r\nwhich flowed from the north. The marl consists largely of very small\r\nshells of animals that lived in the sea. This mixed soil is very\r\nfertile, particularly that in which there is an abundance of marl. This\r\nis found in the \"Marl Belt,\" which is a strip of land extending from\r\nthe Atlantic Highlands southwest past Trenton and Mount Holly as far\r\nas Salem. Its width varies, being widest at its northeastern end and\r\nbecoming narrower and less rich in marl toward the southwest. Formerly\r\nmarl was used extensively as a fertilizer to enrich poorer soils, but\r\nit has been generally displaced by the richer commercial fertilizers.\r\nThe so-called \"Pine Barrens\" which cover a large part of the Plain,\r\neast of the Marl Belt, are comparatively unproductive, but by proper\r\ncultivation and the application of fertilizers, these areas can be made\r\nvery productive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gathering peaches, New Jersey]\r\n\r\n=Crops.=--In the production of grain crops the state cannot, on account\r\nof its varied surface and its small farms, compete with the western\r\nstates with their great plains and large farms. Wheat is produced\r\nmainly for local consumption. Corn is grown in large quantities\r\nin all parts of the state. Rye and buckwheat are also raised in\r\nlimited quantities. Much of the land, particularly that which is not\r\nadapted to the growth of other crops, is devoted to pasture and hay.\r\nMany circumstances are extremely favorable to special agricultural\r\nindustries whose products are vegetables, fruits, flowers, poultry,\r\neggs, milk, and butter. These are: the climate, with its mild winters\r\nand generous rainfall; the fertility of the soil; the large permanent\r\npopulation of the state; the presence of thousands of visitors from\r\nother states at the summer resorts of the state; the nearness of\r\nthe farm lands of the state to the great cities of New York and\r\nPhiladelphia; and the excellent facilities for the rapid transportation\r\nof agricultural products to the markets.\r\n\r\nThe constant demand of the large cities makes market gardening very\r\nprofitable, and this industry is carried on in all parts of the state,\r\nbut with special intensity in those sections which are near the cities.\r\nAll kinds of vegetables are raised. Of these the potato crop is the\r\nmost valuable. In the southern counties, which have a sandy soil, large\r\ncrops of sweet potatoes are produced. This section is also prominent\r\nin the cultivation of tomatoes, beans, and peas, great quantities of\r\nwhich are used in the canning industry. Cabbages, celery, and onions\r\nare valuable products. The demand for fresh, early vegetables has\r\nencouraged market gardeners to devote increased attention to growing\r\nvegetables under glass.\r\n\r\nFruits of all kinds are raised in all parts of the state. In the\r\nnorthwestern section of the state, in parts of Warren, Morris, and\r\nHunterdon counties, peaches are grown in great quantities on the stony\r\nsoil of the glacial drift which is not favorable to general farming. In\r\nthe western section apples and pears are abundant. While strawberries,\r\nblackberries, raspberries, and grapes are grown in all parts of the\r\nstate, they are grown in special abundance in the southern part of the\r\nstate. In this section establishments for the bottling of unfermented\r\ngrape juice have grown up. Huckleberries are common in the wooded\r\nsections of the northern and southern parts of the state. Cranberry\r\nbogs are found in Atlantic, Burlington, and Ocean counties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Poultry buildings, New Jersey Experimental Station, New\r\nBrunswick]\r\n\r\n=Animal Products.=--Dairy farming is successful in all parts of the\r\nstate, particularly in the sections in which pasture and hay are easily\r\nobtained, and in which facilities for the prompt transportation of milk\r\nto the cities are at hand. Milk is produced not only by the general\r\nfarmer but also by special dairy farms, which, by devoting special\r\nattention to the care and feeding of cattle and to the handling of\r\nthe milk, produce milk of a superior quality. Poultry raising and the\r\nproduction of eggs are profitable. The poultry industry is especially\r\nextensive in Cumberland, Atlantic, and Ocean counties.\r\n\r\nWith the increase in the population of the cities the farm land of the\r\nstate is growing in extent and value, but it is clear that more rapid\r\ngrowth is possible and desirable. The State Agricultural School at\r\nRutgers College, with Its Experiment Station and practical courses of\r\ninstruction, is doing much to improve agriculture in New Jersey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A dairy farm in Middlesex County. Corn for silage is\r\ngrowing in front of the buildings]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIron ore is found in many parts of the state. The mines of Morris\r\nCounty in the Highlands are the most productive. Iron ore was smelted\r\nat Shrewsbury in the seventeenth century by Colonel Lewis Morris, and\r\nin many places at the time of the Revolution. The iron industry of the\r\nstate was most extensive and successful during the third quarter of the\r\nlast century. The greater abundance and richness of western ores has\r\nsince made it impossible to operate most of the mines and furnaces\r\nof Warren and Morris counties profitably. The industry has therefore\r\ndeclined. A few mines are still worked, however, in these two counties.\r\nVery rich zinc mines are located in Sussex County, in the neighborhood\r\nof Franklin Furnace. In the production of zinc this state ranks fifth\r\namong the states of the Union.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portland cement factories near Phillipsburg]\r\n\r\nGranite of good quality is found in the Appalachian and Highland\r\nzones. The quarrying of this material is a rapidly growing industry.\r\nBesides granite the sandstone of the Piedmont Plateau is widely used\r\nfor building purposes. Slate is quarried to some extent in Sussex and\r\nWarren counties. Talc, or soapstone, which, ground into powder, is used\r\nin making certain kinds of paper and for other purposes, is found in\r\nWarren County. The production of cement from limestone and shale, found\r\nin the western part of the Highlands near Phillipsburg, has grown to\r\nbe a very important industry. This industry and the quarrying of slate\r\nare parts of the great cement and slate industries of the adjacent\r\nsection of Pennsylvania, across the Delaware, near Easton, which are\r\namong the most important in the country. The trap rock of the Piedmont\r\nPlateau is used for building purposes, road making, and railroad beds.\r\nIts hardness makes it particularly valuable for macadam roads. In all\r\nparts of the state are found deposits of sand and gravel necessary in\r\nbuilding operations.\r\n\r\nThe beds of marl found in the Coastal Plain have already been\r\nmentioned. This region also contains very valuable beds of white sand\r\nand fine clay. This sand is used in the making of glass, and has caused\r\nthe establishment of many glass factories in the southwestern part\r\nof the state. Molding sand is also found in great quantity. The most\r\nextensive beds of clay are found in Mercer and Middlesex counties. In\r\nthe former they are used in the making of pottery and in the latter\r\nin the making of brick, terra cotta, tile, and other clay products.\r\nThe enormous industries of Trenton and of Perth Amboy and its vicinity\r\nare due to the presence of these clays. For the finer pottery, clays\r\nbrought from other states or countries are used. Much clay is shipped\r\nfrom this state to other states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pottery works, Trenton]\r\n\r\n=Manufacturing.=--New Jersey is an important manufacturing state.\r\nIn this state the manufacturing industries have been developed in a\r\nremarkable degree by a combination of conditions and causes. Very\r\nearly in the history of New Jersey the people of the state were forced\r\nby their own needs and the demands of their neighbors to establish\r\nmanufacturing, and thus this industry has the advantage of many years\r\nof growth. The state is rich in certain important natural resources,\r\nwhich have been mentioned. It has profited greatly by its nearness to\r\nthe coal and iron fields of Pennsylvania and to the two great cities of\r\nNew York and Philadelphia, with their enormous demands for manufactured\r\nproducts. The number of intelligent and skillful workers in the state\r\nis unusually large. The facilities for rapid transportation, both of\r\nraw materials from all sources and of finished products to all markets,\r\nare unusually abundant. The navigable waters which fringe the state,\r\nand the transcontinental railroad systems with their branches, which\r\ncross it, facilitate shipments to every part of the world.\r\n\r\nAmong the most important manufactures of New Jersey are refined copper,\r\nsilk and silk goods, foundry and machine shop products, petroleum\r\nproducts, packed meats, woolen and felt goods, wire, leather and\r\nleather goods, electrical machinery, tobacco manufactures, chemicals,\r\nand ships. (See Table II for other manufactures.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Warping silk, silk mills, Paterson]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Weaving silk, Paterson]\r\n\r\nNearly one sixth of the people of the state are engaged in the\r\nmanufacturing industries. Only four states, Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, and New Hampshire, show a larger proportion of\r\nworkers engaged in manufacturing. Although New Jersey is forty-fifth in\r\narea and ninth in population, this state is sixth in the total value of\r\nmanufactured goods, first in the manufacture of silk and silk goods, in\r\nthe smelting and refining of copper, in the manufacture of oil cloth\r\nand linoleum and of sewing machines, second in the manufacture of\r\nchemicals, rubber goods, pottery, terra cotta, and fine clay products,\r\nand of paint and varnish, third in the manufacture of electrical\r\nmachinery and supplies, and fourth in the manufacture of soap and gold\r\nand silver articles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAVEL AND TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the state communication between the settlements\r\nwas by Indian trails, which, as travel increased, expanded into roads.\r\nSettlements on the coast were also connected by sailing vessels. The\r\nroads gradually increased in number and length as the interior of the\r\nstate was developed. Little effort was made, however, toward keeping\r\nthe public roads in good condition. The difficulties of travel and\r\ntransportation led to the construction of many \"turnpikes,\" or roads\r\nbuilt by private companies, which charged tolls for their use. With\r\nvery few exceptions these have been made public roads.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the nineteenth century the foundations of\r\ntransportation by steamboat, canals, and railroads were laid. The\r\nMorris Canal, from Phillipsburg to Jersey City, was projected and\r\nconstructed to bring anthracite coal from Pennsylvania to the iron\r\nforges of northern New Jersey and to New York Bay, and to connect\r\nthe towns along its route with the city of New York. The Delaware and\r\nRaritan Canal, from Bordentown to New Brunswick, the Camden and Amboy\r\nRailroad, and the New Jersey Railroad were constructed in order to\r\nincrease transportation facilities between Philadelphia and New York\r\nharbor. Now all parts of the state are connected with each other and\r\nwith those great centers by many railroad lines. The importance of\r\nour railroads has been much increased by the development of the West\r\nand by the geographical location of the state in the path of direct\r\ncommunication between the western states and the city of New York. All\r\nthe trunk lines from the Middle West, with one exception, pass through\r\nNew Jersey, and have terminals in Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken.\r\nThe state has 2464 miles of railroad, a greater mileage compared\r\nwith its area than any other state. Besides, there are 1294 miles of\r\nelectric railway which traverse all parts of the state and connect all\r\nimportant points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oil refinery and tanks, Elizabethport]\r\n\r\nBecause of the superior advantages of railroads, the canals are now\r\nobsolete, the Morris Canal being practically abandoned. The traffic\r\nbetween New York and Philadelphia is growing so rapidly that it is\r\nprobable that the Delaware and Raritan Canal may be widened and\r\ndeepened and thus may become a barge or ship canal.\r\n\r\nCommunication with Pennsylvania over the Delaware is by means of many\r\nferries and bridges. There is no bridge between New Jersey and New York\r\nover the Hudson, but the construction of one has been proposed. Until\r\n1908 the only means of communication was by ferries. The Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad now enters New York by tunnels extending from the Hackensack\r\nmeadows to its terminal in the city, and Jersey City and Hoboken are\r\nalso connected with New York by tunnels. In cooperation with the State\r\nof New York, New Jersey has provided for the construction of a tunnel\r\nfor vehicles between Jersey City and New York, and, in cooperation\r\nwith Pennsylvania, of a bridge over the Delaware between Camden and\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nThe state is noted for its excellent roads. The state and\r\nmunicipalities are spending vast sums of money on their construction\r\nand maintenance. Funds for state roads, which are in charge of a State\r\nHighway Commission, are obtained from the issuance of automobile\r\nlicenses and from a special road tax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECREATION AND HEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Jersey is rich in its facilities for recreation and recuperation.\r\nThe long sea coast is one long line of attractive summer resorts, which\r\nare famous all over the world, while some places are pleasure and\r\nhealth resorts all the year round, and attractions of a different kind\r\nare found in abundance among the mountains, woods, lakes, and streams\r\nof the northern part of the state.\r\n\r\nUnder authority given by state law the counties and cities have\r\nprovided many parks and playgrounds and have adopted progressive plans\r\nfor extending these healthful provisions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Board Walk, Atlantic City]\r\n\r\nThe state has adopted stringent measures regarding sanitation,\r\nprotection against disease, protection against injury in manufacturing,\r\nhousing conditions, safety in travel, protection of minors in\r\npermissible occupations, and the segregation and treatment of the\r\ntuberculous. State laws provide for the payment of damages to persons\r\ninjured in the industries, and of pensions to dependent widows.\r\n\r\nThe salt marshes are a menace to health and comfort because they are\r\nbreeding places for mosquitoes. The counties are authorized by law to\r\nspend large sums of money for the purpose of destroying these pests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT AND EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\n=Government.=--The Constitution of New Jersey divides the government\r\ninto three departments,--legislative, executive, and judicial. The\r\nlegislative department is vested in the legislature, which is composed\r\nof the senate and the general assembly. The senate is composed of one\r\nsenator from each county, elected by the voters for three years. The\r\ngeneral assembly is composed of sixty assemblymen apportioned among\r\nthe counties according to population and elected by the voters for one\r\nyear. The executive power is vested in the governor, who is elected for\r\na term of three years. A person cannot be governor for two successive\r\nterms. The judicial power is vested in many courts, of which the\r\nprincipal are the court of errors and appeals, which is the highest\r\ncourt, court of chancery, supreme court, circuit court, and courts of\r\ncommon pleas or county courts. The judges are appointed by the governor\r\nwith the approval of the senate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: State Capitol, Trenton]\r\n\r\nThe principal state officers, besides the governor, are secretary of\r\nstate, state treasurer, state comptroller, and attorney-general.\r\n\r\nThe state is divided into twenty-one counties, which are again divided\r\ninto townships, cities, boroughs, and towns. Each of these has its\r\nown government, which is administered in accordance with laws passed\r\nby the legislature. The principal county officers besides the judge\r\nare sheriff, county clerk, surrogate, coroner, county collector, and\r\nmembers of the board of freeholders who are elected by vote of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThe counties maintain courthouses, penitentiaries, farms or homes for\r\nthe aged poor, and may provide parental homes or detention homes for\r\njuvenile delinquents or juvenile witnesses.\r\n\r\nThe state is represented in the United States Congress by two senators\r\nand twelve representatives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: State Normal, Montclair\r\n\r\nState Normal, Trenton\r\n\r\nState Normal, Newark]\r\n\r\n=Education.=--The Constitution requires that \"the legislature shall\r\nprovide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient\r\nsystem of free public schools for the instruction\" of the children of\r\nthe state. It is because of this requirement and the desire of the\r\npeople to enforce it that the state has such excellent schools.\r\n\r\nThe principal officers of the state department of public instruction\r\nare the members of the state board of education, the commissioner\r\nof education, and four assistant commissioners. Each county has a\r\ncounty superintendent of schools, and each city and large town has its\r\nown board of education and superintendent of schools or supervising\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nassua Hall, Princeton University]\r\n\r\nIn the school year 1919-1920 the number of pupils who attended the\r\npublic schools was 591,798. The number of teachers was 18,873. Because\r\nof good schools and of compulsory school attendance, there were in\r\n1910, only 113,502 illiterates, or persons of ten years of age and over\r\nwho could not read or write, or 5.6 per cent of the total population.\r\nOf these illiterates, 93,000 were of foreign birth and less than one\r\nper cent were of native white parentage.\r\n\r\nState normal schools for the training of teachers are located at\r\nTrenton, Montclair, Newark, and Glassboro. City normal schools are\r\nmaintained for the same purpose by Jersey City, Paterson, Trenton,\r\nand Camden. The state maintains summer schools for the preparation of\r\nteachers and makes appropriations to the State Agricultural College,\r\na department of Rutgers College at New Brunswick. Special schools\r\nmaintained by the state are: Farnum School, at Beverly, which is\r\nassociated with the Trenton Normal School; the School for the Deaf at\r\nTrenton; and the Manual Training and Industrial School for Colored\r\nYouths at Bordentown. Higher institutions of learning which are located\r\nin New Jersey are: Princeton University at Princeton, Rutgers College\r\nat New Brunswick, Stevens Institute of Technology at Hoboken, St.\r\nPeter's College at Jersey City, College of St. Elizabeth at Convent\r\nStation, Mount St. Mary's College at Plainfield, Drew Theological\r\nSeminary at Madison, Seton Hall College at South Orange, Upsala College\r\nat Kenilworth, Bloomfield Theological Seminary at Bloomfield, and\r\nCollege of Jersey City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The metropolitan district including northeastern New\r\nJersey and southeastern New York]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe population of New Jersey in 1910, according to the United States\r\nCensus, was 2,537,168; and the density of population, or the number of\r\npeople per square mile, was 337.7. In 1920, according to the United\r\nStates Census, the population was 3,155,900, an increase of 24.4 per\r\ncent., giving a density of 420. Compared with other states. New Jersey\r\nwas tenth in population, and third in density of population, Rhode\r\nIsland being first and Massachusetts second. The area of greatest\r\ndensity of population is the northeastern section, including Bergen,\r\nHudson, Passaic, Essex, Union, and Middlesex counties, which with an\r\narea of 1018 square miles had a population of 2,112,933, or more than\r\nsixty-five per cent, of the total population of the state. In this\r\nsection there were more than 2000 persons per square mile. Hudson\r\nCounty, the smallest in the state, had the largest population, which\r\nwas 629,124 or 14,630 per square mile. In Hoboken, with an area of\r\nless than two square miles, the population was more than 68,000 or\r\nmore than 34,000 to the square mile. Other thickly populated sections\r\nare those of which Trenton and Camden are centers. Cape May County had\r\nthe smallest and Ocean County the most scattered population, which was\r\n22,155 or 35 per square mile.\r\n\r\nThe urban population, that is, the number residing in towns of more\r\nthan 2500 people, was 2,486,378 in 1920, or 79 per cent, of the total\r\npopulation. This still leaves a rural population of 669,522, or about\r\n90 per square mile, who are largely engaged in cultivation of the soil\r\nor the raising of stock.\r\n\r\nThe chief occupations of the people of the state are agriculture,\r\nfishing, manufacturing, and commerce. Many thousands of people of New\r\nJersey are engaged in commercial and industrial enterprises and other\r\nbusiness pursuits, in the large cities of the neighboring states. Many\r\nopportunities for comfortable residence with all conveniences and\r\nadvantages and unsurpassed facilities for rapidly traveling back and\r\nforth attract many to this state who are employed in the cities of New\r\nYork and Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Population of New Jersey]\r\n\r\nAccording to the United States Census of 1920 the population of the\r\nNew York City Metropolitan District was 7,750,237. Included in this\r\ndistrict are the cities and towns in Hudson County and in parts\r\nof Bergen, Passaic, Essex, Union, and Middlesex counties, with a\r\npopulation of 1,795,590. In the Metropolitan District of Philadelphia,\r\nwith a population of over 2,000,000, are parts of Burlington, Camden,\r\nand Gloucester counties with a population of 239,740. It is clear,\r\ntherefore, that the occupations of two thirds of our people, at least,\r\nare subject to the direct influence of the commercial and industrial\r\nactivities of these cities. (The United States Census Bureau defines a\r\nMetropolitan District as that which embraces the central city and all\r\ncities or parts of cities which lie within ten miles of its boundaries.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Broad and Market Streets, Newark]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, BOROUGHS, AND VILLAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cities, towns, boroughs, and villages of New Jersey may be placed\r\nin six groups: first, those in the New York City Metropolitan District;\r\nsecond, places lying just outside the Metropolitan District of New\r\nYork; third, Trenton and the towns of the Upper Delaware Valley;\r\nfourth, places in the Philadelphia Metropolitan District; fifth, places\r\nin the southern part of the state, near Delaware Bay; sixth, cities and\r\ntowns on the Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n=Metropolitan District of New York.=--The following are the chief\r\ncities of New Jersey in the Metropolitan District of New York: Newark,\r\nJersey City, Hoboken, Bayonne, Paterson, Elizabeth, and Perth Amboy.\r\n\r\n=Newark and its Environs.=--Newark, in 1910, had a population of\r\n347,469 and in 1920 of 414,216. It is the largest city in the state\r\nand fifteenth in the United States. It was settled in 1666 by settlers\r\nfrom Connecticut. It is located on the Passaic River and Newark Bay\r\nand has a frontage on the river and bay of eleven miles. It has water\r\ncommunication with New York Bay by way of Newark Bay and Kill van Kull.\r\nThe United States government has dredged a channel in the bay three\r\nhundred fifty feet wide by twenty feet deep. This great improvement\r\nand improvements made by the city at great expense will greatly\r\nincrease the commerce of the city. The city enjoys excellent railroad\r\nfacilities. Nine railroads including the great trunk lines have\r\nfourteen stations in the city. It is directly connected with the city\r\nof New York by passenger trains which pass through the Hudson tunnels.\r\nIt has numerous banks, fine office buildings, and large department\r\nstores. Many trolley lines which radiate from it bring to it the trade\r\nof the many neighboring cities.\r\n\r\nNewark is the first city in the state in the variety of its\r\nmanufactures and in the value of its manufactured products. It is\r\neleventh among the cities of the United States in the value of such\r\nproducts. Its great progress in manufactures is due to an early start,\r\nto the stimulus given by the opening of the Morris Canal and by\r\nrailroad and water transportation. It has a large number of important\r\nindustries which include smelting and refining, the making of shoes,\r\nleather goods of all kinds, hats, jewelry, iron, steel, and brass\r\nproducts of all kinds, watch cases, paints and varnishes, clothing,\r\nelectrical machinery and appliances, automobile supplies, tinware,\r\nadvertising novelties, celluloid products, trunks, fertilizers, furs,\r\nbrewery products, and cigars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Storage-battery factory, West Orange]\r\n\r\nNewark has an excellent supply of water which is drawn from the valley\r\nof the Pequannock River in the northern part of the Passaic basin,\r\ntwenty-six miles from the city.\r\n\r\nSurrounding Newark are many important cities and towns which reflect\r\nthe social, commercial, and industrial influences of that city as\r\nwell as those of New York. Among these are =Belleville=, =Nutley=,\r\n=Montclair=, =Glen Ridge=, =Bloomfield=, =Orange=, =East Orange=,\r\n=West Orange=, =South Orange=, =Irvington=, and =Summit=. These are\r\nall largely residential towns whose location and abundance of eligible\r\nsites for homes are attractive. They are all exceptionally active in\r\nproviding educational facilities. They are all closely connected with\r\nNewark and the city of New York by many railroad and trolley lines.\r\nIn most of them land is in such demand for residential purposes, that\r\nit cannot be used profitably for manufacturing purposes, so that\r\nthis industry is naturally discouraged. In some of them, however,\r\nespecially those nearest to Newark, large industrial establishments\r\nhave grown up. =Belleville=, just north of Newark, has long been noted\r\nfor its industrial activity and is rapidly growing in importance in\r\nthis respect. Nutley, farther to the north, is well known as a town\r\nof beautiful homes. =Montclair=, located on the slope of the Orange\r\nMountains, is noted for its beautiful scenery, its commanding view of\r\nmany square miles of surrounding country with many populous cities, and\r\nits multitude of beautiful homes, and is the home of one of the state\r\nnormal schools. =Glen Ridge= and =Bloomfield=, similarly situated,\r\nare also characterized by their fine dwellings. Bloomfield contains\r\nmany extensive manufacturing establishments. Among the products are\r\nelectrical lamps and appliances, woolen and worsted goods, colored\r\nlabels, cream separators, chemicals, rubber goods, and iron and steel\r\nproducts. Besides being an attractive center for residences. =Orange=\r\nis a very productive industrial center. Its principal industry is\r\nthe manufacture of hats. =East Orange= has long been famous because\r\nof its superior attractiveness for dwelling purposes and is filled\r\nwith beautiful homes. While the high cost of land does not invite\r\nmanufactures, several large industries are located here. Electrical\r\nmotors and generators, surgical appliances, electrical appliances,\r\nmachinery, lamps, and hats are manufactured in large quantities.\r\n=West Orange= is noted for the manufacture of phonographs, phonograph\r\nrecords, moving picture instruments and films, and storage batteries.\r\nHats are also extensively manufactured. =South Orange= and =Summit=\r\nare most attractive residential places, and are developing rapidly\r\nalong this line rather than in the line of manufactures. Summit has\r\nan important silk industry. =Irvington=, while long known as a town\r\ndevoted to residences, is feeling the industrial impulse of Newark,\r\nof which it is a suburb, and is rapidly becoming a manufacturing\r\ncenter of great importance. Its industries are varied and include the\r\nproduction of castings, graphite products, tools, cutlery, and gold,\r\nsilver, and platinum products. Across the Passaic River from Newark\r\nare =East Newark=, =Harrison=, and =Kearney=, the last including\r\n=Arlington=. These municipalities are located in Hudson County and are,\r\ntherefore, officially connected with Jersey City as its county seat.\r\nBut they are much nearer Newark, with which they are closely connected\r\nby industrial and commercial ties. They are prosperous manufacturing\r\ncenters with industries of national importance. In =East Newark= the\r\nmost important manufactures are sewing thread and shade rollers. In\r\nHarrison the industries are varied and the products include iron and\r\nsteel, incandescent lamps, steam pumps, roller bearings, elevators,\r\nsteel and tin toys, electric wire, trunks, brass products, tools,\r\nmetal novelties, castings, and machinery. In =Kearney= the important\r\nmanufactures are linoleums, yarns, twine, glue, oils, fertilizers,\r\nships, and castings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jersey City as seen from the Hudson]\r\n\r\n=Jersey City and its Environs.=--A long narrow peninsula lies between\r\nthe Hudson River and New York Bay on the east, and the Hackensack\r\nRiver and Newark Bay on the west. On this peninsula are located many\r\nprosperous cities. On the southern half, which is in Hudson County, is\r\nfound the most densely populated part of the state, with many large\r\ncities of great industrial and commercial importance.\r\n\r\n=Jersey City=, the largest of this group, had, in 1910, a population of\r\n267,779, and in 1920, according to the United States Census, 297,864.\r\nIt is the second city of the state in size, and twenty-first in the\r\nUnited States. Parts of it were occupied by the Dutch soon after New\r\nYork was settled, but the first permanent government was established\r\nin 1660 at Bergen, which is now a part of the city. Here were also\r\nestablished the first school and the first church in the state. It is\r\nlocated on New York Bay and the Hudson River and extends westward from\r\nthese waters to Newark Bay and the Hackensack River. It has a frontage\r\non tidal waters of about twelve miles and has therefore unexcelled\r\nfacilities for transportation by vessels of any size to all the\r\nseaports of the world. Thirteen railroads have terminals in the city.\r\nBesides these, there are eleven other passenger and freight stations\r\nin the city. Here the railroads bring the products of all parts of the\r\ncountry directly to the ships which sail to all parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe city is connected directly with the city of New York by railroads\r\nwhich pass through tunnels under the Hudson. Numerous trolley lines\r\nconnect the different parts of the city with each other and with other\r\nparts of the state. There are nineteen banks and trust companies.\r\nIn manufacturing, Jersey City ranks second in the state. Its great\r\ncommercial and industrial growth is due to its nearness to New York, to\r\nits connection with that city by ferries and railroad tunnels, by which\r\npassengers and freight are carried to the heart of the city of New York\r\nin a few minutes, and to the abundance of facilities for all kinds of\r\ntransportation. The most important products are sugar, printers' type,\r\nsoaps and perfumes, meats, silks and embroideries, graphite products,\r\nlead pencils, tobacco, cigars, iron, steel and brass products, fire\r\nhose, rubber goods, soups, watches, chemicals, electrical supplies,\r\nheating and lighting apparatus, rope, and paints and varnishes.\r\n\r\nThe water used by the city is of excellent quality and is brought from\r\nthe basin of the Rockaway River in the northern part of the state. The\r\ncity has eight municipal parks and one county park, containing nearly\r\ntwo hundred fifty acres. The city maintains a normal school for the\r\ntraining of its teachers and has an excellent public library.\r\n\r\nBesides being an active industrial center it is a residential city.\r\nMany thousands whose occupations are in the city of New York live in\r\nJersey City.\r\n\r\nNorth of Jersey City and adjacent to it is =Hoboken=. It is the most\r\ndensely populated city in the state. It has connections with several\r\nrailroads, and one of the great trunk lines has its terminal station\r\nhere. The steamships of several of the most important transatlantic\r\nlines, including Scandinavian and Dutch, dock in Hoboken. Hoboken is\r\nconnected with the city of New York by the Hudson River tunnels and by\r\nferries and with other cities of the state by many trolley lines. Its\r\nmanufacturing industries include shipbuilding and repairing and the\r\nmaking of lead pencils, surveying and nautical instruments, marine\r\nengines and boilers, silk goods, furniture, and wall paper. Here is\r\nlocated the well-known Stevens Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\nNorth of Hoboken and Jersey City are several cities and towns which\r\nare very important industrially and are rapidly growing in population.\r\nTheir nearness to these cities and to each other makes their industries\r\nand interests similar. These are =West Hoboken=, =Union=, =West New\r\nYork=, =North Bergen=, =Weehawken=, =Guttenberg=, and =Secaucus=. These\r\nare all populous and thriving communities. There are many valuable\r\nindustries, among which the manufacture of silks and embroideries is\r\nthe most important. This section leads the state in the manufacture\r\nof embroideries and is second only to Paterson in that of silk goods.\r\nOther industries are machine shops, marine construction, and the\r\nmanufacture of pianos, lamps, lard, and rubber goods. In =Secaucus=\r\nvegetable gardening is important.\r\n\r\nSouth of Jersey City lies the city of =Bayonne=, which is the third\r\ncity of the state in the value of manufactured products. Its frontage\r\non New York Bay on the east, Newark Bay on the west, and Kill van\r\nKull on the south, gives it exceptional facilities for deep-water\r\ntransportation. It has, besides, ample railroad facilities. It is the\r\nmost important center for the refining of petroleum in the world.\r\nThe oil is brought in pipe lines from the oil fields of Pennsylvania\r\nand Ohio to the refineries, from which the many refined products are\r\ncarried to all parts of the world. There are many other extensive\r\nindustries, of which the following may be mentioned: the manufacturing\r\nof steam boilers, iron, steel, and bronze products, cottonseed oil,\r\nnickel and copper products, borax, insulated wire, and silk goods.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of the peninsula, which is in Bergen County, contains\r\nmany attractive towns which are largely residential in character. Among\r\nthem are =Englewood= and =Fort Lee=. =Edgewater= on the Hudson at the\r\nfoot of the Palisades has important industries. The chief products are\r\nsugar and sirups.\r\n\r\n=Paterson and Neighboring Cities and Towns.=--Paterson, located at the\r\nFalls of the Passaic River, had a population in 1920 of 135,866 and\r\nis the third city of the state in size. The founding of the city was\r\nsuggested by Alexander Hamilton, who foresaw the value of the power\r\ngenerated by the falls and made plans to use it for manufacturing\r\npurposes. Its great growth as a manufacturing center is largely due to\r\nthis power. In the value of its manufactures, it is the fifth among the\r\ncities of the state. Its most important industry is the manufacture of\r\nsilk products of all kinds. In this industry it stands first among the\r\ncities of the country. It has many other extensive industrial plants,\r\nwhich include machine shops, foundries, rolling mills, locomotive\r\nworks, dyeing establishments, and thread and cordage mills.\r\n\r\n=Passaic=, located on the Passaic River a few miles southeast of\r\nPaterson, is specially noted for its manufacture of woolen and worsted\r\ngoods, in which it is the first city of the state. It has other\r\nextensive industries, including the manufacture of handkerchiefs\r\nand other cotton goods, rubber goods, belting and packing material,\r\nmachinery, metal, leather and silk goods, and print and chemical works.\r\nPassaic is, besides, an attractive residential city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Docks at Hoboken. The principal port of embarkation and\r\ndebarkation of United States troops in the World War]\r\n\r\nNortheast of Passaic is =Hackensack= on the Hackensack River, which\r\nis a prosperous residential town. Between Paterson and Passaic are\r\n=Clifton=, a growing manufacturing town, =Lodi=, with its extensive\r\ndyeing industry, and =Garfield= with its large establishments for the\r\nmanufacture of woolen and worsted goods, waxed paper, embroideries,\r\nand yarns. Southwest of Paterson is =Little Falls=, whose principal\r\nmanufactures are carpets and rugs. =Rutherford=, =Hasbrouck Heights=,\r\n=Ridgewood=, and =Westwood= are towns in this section which are\r\nspecially inviting to residents.\r\n\r\n=Elizabeth and Neighboring Towns.=--Elizabeth is one of the oldest\r\ntowns in the state. It was settled in 1664 and was the residence of\r\nSir Philip Carteret, the first Governor of New Jersey. It is most\r\nfavorably situated for both manufacturing and residential purposes. Its\r\nlocation on Arthur Kill and Newark Bay gives it deep water connection\r\nthrough Kill van Kull with New York Bay, and it has besides ample\r\nrailroad facilities. It has many industries, the largest of which, and\r\nthe largest of its kind in the world, is the manufacture of sewing\r\nmachines. Other industries are the manufacture of iron and steel\r\nproducts of all kinds, and of electrical appliances, tanning, printing,\r\nand shipbuilding. It has always been popular as a place of residence\r\nwith many whose business is in New York.\r\n\r\n=Rahway=, a few miles southwest of Elizabeth, is a flourishing city\r\nwhose chief industries are the manufacture of felt, cereals, steel\r\nproducts, clothing, music boxes, and printing and book binding.\r\n=Roselle=, =Roselle Park=, =Cranford=, and =Westfield= are attractive\r\nresidential towns west of Elizabeth, with excellent educational\r\nfacilities. =Garwood=, in this vicinity, is an important manufacturing\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n=Perth Amboy and Neighboring Towns.=--Perth Amboy was settled in 1684\r\nand alternated with Burlington as the meeting place of the New Jersey\r\nassembly after the union of the provinces in 1702. Its great industrial\r\nactivity has increased its population by more than 100 per cent in the\r\nlast fifteen years. Its rapid industrial growth is due to its location\r\nat the mouth of the Raritan River and on Raritan Bay and Arthur Kill,\r\nas well as to its railroad facilities, and to the extensive deposits\r\nof clay which are found here. The development of these has led to the\r\nestablishment of large manufacturing plants whose products are terra\r\ncotta, earthenware, and tile of all kinds. Other important industries\r\nare the refining of gold, silver, copper, and lead, the preparation of\r\nvaseline, boat building, the shipping of coal, and the manufacture of\r\ncigars, insulated wire, chemicals, and steel products. It is the fourth\r\ncity in the state in the value of manufactured products.\r\n\r\nNear Perth Amboy are =Metuchen=, =Woodbridge=, =South Amboy=,\r\n=Sayreville=, and =South River=, which are populous towns and have\r\nextensive industries similar to those of Perth Amboy. In =Woodbridge=\r\nthe output of fire brick is specially important. In =Sayreville= and\r\n=South River= special attention is given to the manufacture of building\r\nbrick. In all there is considerable shipping of clays to other points.\r\nMany varied industries are found in Carteret to the northeast of\r\nWoodbridge.\r\n\r\n=Places on the Outskirts of the Metropolitan District of New\r\nYork.=--Lying just beyond the New York City Metropolitan District, yet\r\nfeeling its influence more and more as the facilities for communication\r\nare increased, are a number of important towns.\r\n\r\n=Morristown=, in Morris County, is famous because of Its Revolutionary\r\nassociations. It is distinctively a residential town, which possesses\r\ngreat municipal and educational advantages. =Madison= is another\r\nresidential town, whose peculiar and most important industry is the\r\ncultivation of roses. =Boonton= and =Dover= have picturesque locations\r\nand are industrially active. Their chief products are boilers,\r\nfurnaces, hosiery, iron, hats, and silk goods.\r\n\r\nIn Union County is =Plainfield=, which is well known on account of its\r\nresidential advantages, its unexcelled schools, and its industrial\r\nimportance. Its principal manufactures are printing presses, electrical\r\nappliances, garments, machine tools, and machine shop products. =North\r\nPlainfield= is a residential suburb.\r\n\r\n=Somerville= is an attractive and prosperous town with industries which\r\nmanufacture clothing, laces, and iron pipe. =Bound Brook= is at the\r\njunction of three trunk line railroads and is located on the Raritan\r\nCanal. It is therefore an active industrial center. At =Finderne=,\r\nbetween Somerville and Bound Brook, are large asbestos works.\r\n\r\n=New Brunswick=, which was built up about the ferry established here in\r\n1697, is situated on the Raritan River and at the eastern end of the\r\nRaritan Canal, and enjoys superior facilities for water and railroad\r\ntransportation. Its most extensive industry is the manufacture of\r\nsurgical dressings. Other manufactured products are machinery, woolen\r\ngoods, iron and steel products, automobiles, cigars, and wall paper.\r\nHere is situated Rutgers College, which includes the State Agricultural\r\nCollege and Experiment Station. The State Home for Boys is located at\r\n=Jamesburg=. =Keyport=, with its fisheries and growing manufacturing\r\nindustries, is situated on lower New York Bay and has rail and water\r\nconnections with that city. =Freehold= is always associated with the\r\nbattle of Monmouth. It has important canning and rug-making industries.\r\n\r\n=Trenton and the Towns of the Upper Delaware Valley.=--Trenton, the\r\ncapital of the state since 1790, was settled about 1679. Here occurred\r\nthe Battle of Trenton, which is commemorated by an imposing monument.\r\nIt is situated on the Delaware at the head of navigation. The Delaware\r\nand Raritan Canal passes through the city. It thus has the advantage\r\nof transportation by water and railway. The water power developed by\r\nthe Falls of the Delaware encouraged the establishment and growth of\r\nthe city's industries, but these have grown so extensive that they\r\ndo not rely upon it. In the neighborhood of Trenton are deposits of\r\nclay which were the basis of the pottery industry. It has forty-eight\r\npotteries and in this industry it is rivaled by only one city in the\r\nUnited States. The local clay is now used very little. The better\r\ngrades of pottery require the finer clays which are obtained from\r\nEngland, France, and some states of this country. It manufactures\r\nmore sanitary earthenware than any other city in the country. Other\r\nextensive industries are automobile factories, iron and steel works,\r\nmachine shops, foundries, rubber works, woolen mills, watch factories,\r\nand oilcloth and linoleum factories.\r\n\r\nThe state and city acting together have created a large public park\r\nwhich extends along the Delaware River and includes the grounds around\r\nthe state capitol. The trade of the surrounding country makes the city\r\na thriving business center.\r\n\r\nNortheast of Trenton is =Princeton=, memorable as the scene of the\r\nBattle of Princeton and rich in historic associations. Here is located\r\nPrinceton University, founded in 1746.\r\n\r\n=Lambertville=, on the Delaware northeast of Trenton, is a prosperous\r\ntown with considerable water power, whose principal industries are\r\nrock quarries, rubber works, and canning factories. =Pennington=\r\nand =Hopewell= in the interior are industrious canning centers. At\r\n=Phillipsburg=, on the Delaware, opposite the mouth of the Lehigh,\r\nfive railroads meet. It is the western terminus of the Morris Canal.\r\nThese transportation facilities make it a strongly industrial town. Its\r\nprincipal products are air compressors and rock drills, horseshoes,\r\ncanisters, iron pipe, boilers, and silks. The principal cement works of\r\nthe state are located near Phillipsburg. =Belvidere=, on the Delaware\r\nabove Phillipsburg; =Washington=, =Hackettstown=, and =Blairstown=, in\r\nthe interior, are popular residential towns. In =Washington= pianos\r\nand organs, and in =Hackettstown= saws and leather, are the chief\r\nindustrial products. In =Hackettstown= and =Blairstown= well-known\r\neducational institutions are located. =Newton= is located in the\r\npicturesque mountain region of Sussex County. Here dairy farming is\r\nimportant. Its chief manufactures are shoes, silks, and dyeing.\r\n\r\n=Flemington= and =High Bridge=, in Hunterdon County, though not located\r\nin the Delaware Valley, are near it. They are important centers of\r\ntrade in agricultural sections with growing industries. =High Bridge=\r\nis in the heart of the peach-growing section and has large steel works.\r\nSo also =Franklin Furnace=, in Sussex County, is in the Wallkill Valley\r\nand is the center of the zinc-mining industry.\r\n\r\n=Camden and Neighboring Cities and Towns.=--In this group are included\r\nthe towns which are located in the southwestern part of the state and\r\nwhich are usually considered as belonging to the Metropolitan District\r\nof Philadelphia or are near it. All are vitally affected by its\r\nstimulating commercial and industrial impulse.\r\n\r\nThe largest city of this group is =Camden=, on the Delaware opposite\r\nPhiladelphia, founded about 1680 and known in colonial days as\r\nCooper's Ferry. It shares with Philadelphia the advantages of the\r\ndeep-water route to the ocean through the Delaware River and Bay.\r\nIt owes Its first industrial impulse to the opening of the Camden\r\nand Amboy Railroad. From It many railroads radiate to all parts\r\nof the state and one crosses the Delaware to Pennsylvania. Direct\r\ncommunication with Philadelphia is maintained by ferries. More rapid\r\ncommunication will soon be obtained when the proposed tunnels under\r\nthe Delaware are completed. Its industries, which are of the most\r\nvaried character, have increased with astonishing rapidity. The most\r\nextensive are the manufacture of talking machines and shipbuilding.\r\nHere the largest battleships and merchant vessels can be built. One of\r\nthe shipbuilding plants is the largest in the country. Other extensive\r\nindustries are foundries, machine shops, woolen mills, chemical works,\r\nfactories for the manufacture of cigars, paints, candies, leather,\r\nlicorice, linoleum, writing pens, and the preparation of soups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canning factory, filling and capping cans, Camden]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camden, Philadelphia, and vicinity]\r\n\r\nNortheast of Camden, on the Delaware, are =Riverside= and =Beverly=,\r\nwhich are important centers of manufacture and of truck farming.\r\nFarther up is =Burlington=, which was settled in 1677 and was the\r\ncapital of West Jersey. It has ample facilities for transportation by\r\nrail and water. Its interests are both agricultural and manufacturing.\r\nIts principal products are shoes, iron pipe, and hardware.\r\n=Bordentown=, the southwestern terminus of the Delaware and Raritan\r\nCanal, also has excellent transportation facilities. Its most important\r\nindustries are the canning of vegetables and the manufacture of yarns\r\nand clay products. In the interior, the old town. =Mount Holly=,\r\nis rich in agricultural products and has industries which produce\r\nhosiery, shoes, and tapestry goods. East and southeast of Camden are\r\n=Merchantville=, =Moorestown=, =Collingswood=, and =Haddonfield=, which\r\nare distinctively residential towns, but in which vegetable raising is\r\nan important industry.\r\n\r\n=Gloucester=, on the Delaware south of Camden, is a growing industrial\r\ncenter. Its products are yarns, paper, and gas mantles. It has\r\ncommunication with Philadelphia by ferries, which transport the produce\r\nof the rich truck and fruit farms of the surrounding country to that\r\ncity. =Woodbury= is a prosperous residential town with industries which\r\nmake pianos and glass bottles. Next to the southward are Swedesboro,\r\n=Glassboro=, and =Clayton=, whose principal industrial activities are\r\nconnected with the making of glass and the raising and canning of\r\nvegetables and fruits.\r\n\r\n=Towns near Delaware Bay.=--Farther south on the outskirts of the\r\nPhiladelphia Metropolitan District are the very active business\r\nand industrial center, =Salem=, settled by the Quakers in 1675,\r\n=Bridgeton=, =Vineland=, and =Millville=.\r\n\r\nIn these towns the glass factories are extensive and make all kinds\r\nof glass articles. In =Bridgeton= and =Millville= many persons are\r\nemployed in the mining and shipping of glass sand. Molding sand is also\r\na product. In and surrounding these towns are large areas of farm land\r\ndevoted to the raising of all kinds of vegetables, berries, and tree\r\nfruits for the markets. Great quantities of these are preserved in the\r\nmany large canning factories which are located in them. =Vineland=\r\nproduces much bottled grape juice. These towns have also diversified\r\nindustries of other kinds.\r\n\r\nIn =Cape May Court House= the important industrial activities are the\r\nmaking of glass bottles and the raising of berries and other fruits.\r\n\r\n=Cities and Towns on the Atlantic Coast.=--Along the Atlantic coast are\r\nmany cities and towns which are popular health and pleasure resorts.\r\nThe many railroads which connect them with the large cities have made\r\nthem convenient of access so that thousands of people visit them in the\r\nsummer time.\r\n\r\nThe largest of these is =Atlantic City=, which is the largest seaside\r\nresort in the country and is devoted entirely to the entertainment of\r\nvisitors. It is said to contain more than one thousand hotels. Its\r\npermanent population numbers somewhat more than 50,000, but in the\r\nsummer time its population is estimated at about 300,000. It has a\r\nclimate favorable to those who are convalescing from illness or seek to\r\nrecuperate their health. On this account it is a popular resort during\r\nthe entire year. It has a superior school system and all the other\r\nfacilities and institutions which mark the progressive city. =Long\r\nBranch=, farther north, is the oldest resort on the coast. Another\r\nresort of many years standing is =Cape May City=. Other well-known\r\nresorts are =Ocean City=, =Point Pleasant=, =Sea Girt=, =Manasquan=,\r\n=Spring Lake=, =Belmar=, =Ocean Grove=, =Asbury Park=, =Sea Bright=,\r\nand =Atlantic Highlands=. =Red Bank=, with its many attractive country\r\nhomes, is situated on the Navesink and is classed as a seaside resort.\r\n\r\n=Lakewood=, among the pines of Ocean County, is a popular winter health\r\nresort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLES\r\n\r\n\r\nTable I.--References on the Geography of New Jersey\r\n\r\n  1.
