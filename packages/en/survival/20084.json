He was thirty-two\r\nyears of age and he had used the sea since twelve--twenty years. His\r\npast was a long succession of fo'c'sles, bar-rooms, blazing suns, storms\r\nand sea happenings so run together that all sequence was lost. Beyond\r\nthem lay a dismal blotch, his childhood. He had entered the world and\r\nliterally and figuratively had been laid at the door of a workhouse; of\r\nhis childhood he remembered little, of his parentage he knew nothing. In\r\ndrink he was quiet, but most dangerous under certain provocations.\r\n\r\nIt was as though deep in his being lay a blazing hatred born of\r\ninjustice through ages and only coming to light when upborne by\r\nballoon-juice. On these occasions a saloon bar with its glitter and\r\nphantom show of mirth and prosperity sometimes called on him to dispense\r\nand destroy it, the passion to fight the crowd seized him, a passion\r\nthat has its origin, perhaps, in sources other than alcohol.\r\n\r\nHe was talking now to Harbutt, scarcely lowering his voice on account of\r\nthe fellows in the bunks. Snoring and drugged with ozone a kick would\r\nonly have made them curse and turn on the other side, and as he talked\r\nhis voice made part of that procession of noises inseparable from the\r\nfo'c'sle of a ship under sail against a head sea. He had been holding\r\nforth on the food and general conditions of this ship compared with the\r\nfood and conditions of his last, when Harbutt cut in.\r\n\r\n\"There's not a pin to choose between owners, and ships is owners as far\r\nas a sailorman's concerned.--Blast them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was in a hooker once,\" said Raft, \"and the Old Man came across a lot\r\nof cheap sugar, served it out to save the m'lasses. It was lead, most of\r\nit, and the chaps that swallowed it their teeth came out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to them then?\"\r\n\r\n\"They croaked. I joined at Bombay, after the business, or I'd have\r\ncroaked too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What ship was that?\" asked Harbutt.\r\n\r\n\"I've forgot her name, it was a good bit back--but it's the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it's the truth,\" replied the other, \"who's doubtin' you, any\r\ndog's trick played on a sailorman's the truth, you can lay to that.\r\nI've had four years of sea and I oughta know.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's this you were?\" asked Raft.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was a lot o' things,\" replied Harbutt. \"Wished I'd never left\r\nthem to join this b--y business, but it's the same ashore, owners all\r\nthe time stuffin' themselves and gettin' rich, workers starvin'.\"\r\n\r\nRaft belonged to the old time labour world dating from Pelagon, he\r\ngrumbled, but had no grudge against owners in general, it was only in\r\ndrink that Pelagon rose in him. Harbutt was an atom of the new voice\r\nthat is heard everywhere now, even in fo'c'sles. He had failed in\r\neverything on land and a'board ship he was a slacker. You cannot be a\r\nvoice and an A.B. at the same time.\r\n\r\n\"What was your last job ashore?\" went on Raft with the persistence of a\r\nchild, always wanting to know.\r\n\r\n\"Cleanin' out pig sties,\" said Harbutt viciously. \"Drove to it. I tell\r\nyou when a chap's down he's down, the chaps that has money tramples on\r\nthe chaps that hasn't. I've been through it and I know. It's the rich\r\nman does it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Raft, \"I don't even remember seeing one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you ever been in no cities?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been in cities right enough, but most by the water-side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've seen chaps in plug hats and chaps drivin' in carriages,\r\nthat's the sort that keeps us down, that's the sort we've got to make\r\nan end of.\"\r\n\r\nRaft did not quite see. He had a respect for Harbutt mixed with a\r\ncontempt for him as a sailor. Harbutt knew a lot--but he could not see\r\nhow the chaps in plug hats kept other people down; the few he had seen\r\nhad always seemed to him away and beyond his world, soft folk, and\r\nalways busy about their own affairs--and how were they to be made an end\r\nof?\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean killing them?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's other ways than killin',\" replied Harbutt. \"It's not them,\r\nit's their money does the trick.\"\r\n\r\nHe finished his patch and turned in. Raft finished his pipe and turned\r\nin also and the fo'c'sle was given over to the noises of the sea and the\r\nstraining timbers of the ship.\r\n\r\nNow that the figures of the two sailors had vanished its personality\r\ntook fuller life, grim, dark, close, like the interior of a grimy hand\r\nclutching the lives of all those sleepers. The beams shewed like the\r\ncurved fingers, and the heel of the bowsprit like the point of the\r\nin-turned thumb, a faint soul-killing rock of kerosene filled it,\r\nintensifying, after the fashion of ambergris, all the other perfumes,\r\nwithout losing in power. Bilge, tobacco and humanity, you cannot know\r\nwhat these things are till they are married with the reek of kerosene,\r\nwith the grunts and snores of weary men, with lamplight dimmed with\r\nsmoke haze; with the heave and fall of the sea; the groaning of timbers\r\nand the boom of the waves. This is the fo'c'sle whose great, great,\r\ngreat grandmother was the lower deck of the trireme where slaves chained\r\nto benches laboured till they died, just as they labour to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nNORTH-WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Albatross_, bound from Cape Town to Melbourne, had been blown out\r\nof her course and south of the Crozet Islands; she was now steering\r\nnorth-west, making towards Kerguelen, across an ice-blue sea, vast, like\r\na country of broken crystal strewn with snow. The sky, against which the\r\ntop-gallant stay-sails shewed gull-white in the sun, had the cold blue\r\nof the sea and was hung round at the horizon by clouds like the white\r\nclouds that hang round the Pacific Trades.\r\n\r\nRaft was at the wheel and Captain Pound the master was pacing the deck\r\nwith Mason the first officer, up and down, pausing now and then for a\r\nglance away to windward, now with an eye aloft at the steadfast canvas,\r\ntalking all the time of subjects half a world away.\r\n\r\nIt was a sociable ship as far as the afterguard was concerned. Pound\r\nbeing a rough and capable man of the old school with no false dignity\r\nand an open manner of speech. He had been talking of his little house at\r\nTwickenham, of Mrs. Pound and the children, of servants and neighbours\r\nthat were unsociable and now he was talking of dreams. He had been\r\ndreaming the night before of Pembroke docks, the port he had started\r\nfrom as a boy. Pembroke docks was a bad dream for Pound, and he said so.\r\nIt always heralded some disaster when it appeared before him in\r\ndreamland.\r\n\r\n\"I've always dreamt before that I was starting from there,\" said he,\r\n\"but last night I was getting the old _Albatross_ in, and the tow rope\r\nwent, and the tug knocked herself to bits, and then the old hooker swung\r\nround and there was Mrs. P. on the quayside in her night attire shouting\r\nto me to put the helm down--under hare sticks in the docks, mind you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dreams are crazy things,\" said Mason. \"I don't believe there's anything\r\nin them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe not,\" said Pound. He glanced at the binnacle card and then\r\nwent below.\r\n\r\nNothing is more impressive to the unaccustomed mind than the spars and\r\ncanvas of a ship under full sail seen from the deck, nothing more\r\nsuggestive of power and the daring of man than the sight of those\r\nleviathan spars and vast sail spaces rising dizzily from main and\r\nforesail in pyramids to where the truck works like a pencil point\r\nwriting on the sky. Nothing more arresting than the power of the\r\nsteersman. A turn of the wheel in the hands of Raft would set all that\r\ncanvas shuddering or thundering, spilling the wind as the water is\r\nspilled from a reservoir, a moment's indecision or slackness might lose\r\nthe ship a mile on her course. But Raft steered as he breathed,\r\nautomatically, almost unconsciously, almost without effort. He, who\r\nashore was hopelessly adrift and without guidance, at the helm was all\r\nwisdom, direction and intuition.\r\n\r\nThe wake of the _Albatross_ lay as if drawn with a ruler.\r\n\r\nHis trick was nearly up, and when he was relieved he went forward;\r\npausing at the fo'c'sle head to light a pipe he fell in talk with some\r\nof the hands, leaning with his back against the bulwarks and blown upon\r\nby the spill of the wind from the head sails.\r\n\r\nAn old shell-back by name of Ponting was holding the floor.\r\n\r\n\"We're comin' up to Kerguelen,\" he was saying. \"Should think I did know\r\nit. Put in there in a sealer out of New Bedford in '82. I wasn't more'n\r\na boy then. The Yanks used to use that place a lot in those days. The\r\nblackest blastedest hole I ever struck. Christmas Island was where we\r\nlay mostly, for two months, the chaps huntin' the wal'uses and killin'\r\nmore than they could carry. The blastedest hole I ever struck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was there in a Dane once,\" began another of the crew. \"It was time of\r\nyear the sea cows was matin' and you could hear the roarin' of them ten\r\nmile off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dane,\" said Ponting, \"what made you ship a'board a Dane--I've heard\r\ntell of Danes. Knew a chap signed on in one of them Leith boots out of\r\nCopenhagen runnin' north, one of them old North Sea cattle trucks turned\r\ninto a passenger tramp, passengers and ponies with a hundred ton of hay\r\nstowed forward and the passengers lyin' on their backs on it smokin'\r\ntheir pipes, and the bridge crawled over with passengers, girls and\r\nchildren, and the chap at the wheel havin' to push 'em out of the way,\r\nkept hittin' reefs all the run from Leith to God knows where, and the\r\nOld Man playin' the fiddle most of the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"That chap said the Danes was a d----d lot too sociable for him.\"\r\n\r\nRaft listened without entirely comprehending. He had always been a\r\nfore-mast hand. He knew practically nothing of steam and he would just\r\nas soon have fancied himself a railway porter as a hand on a passenger\r\nship. He was one of the old school of merchant seamen and the idea of a\r\ncargo of girls and children and general passengers, not to speak of\r\nponies, was beyond him.\r\n\r\nThe girls he had mostly known were of the wharf-side. He finished his\r\npipe and went down below--and turned in.\r\n\r\nHe was rousted out by the voice of the Bo'sw'n calling for all hands on\r\ndeck and slipping into his oilskins he came up, receiving a smack of sea\r\nin his face as he emerged from the fo'c'sle hatch. The wind had shifted\r\nand a black squall coming up from astern had hit the ship. More was\r\ncoming and through the sheeting rain and spindrift the voice of the\r\nBo'sw'n was roaring to let go the fore top-gallant halyards.\r\n\r\nNext moment Raft was in the rigging followed by others. The sail had to\r\nbe stowed. The wind tried to tear him loose and the sheeting rain to\r\ndrown him, but he went on clinging to the top-gallant mast-stays and\r\nlooking down he could see the faces of the others following him, faces\r\nsheeted over with rain and working blindly upwards.\r\n\r\nPonting was the man immediately below him, and taking breath for a\r\nmoment and against the wind, Ponting was now yelling out that they had\r\ntheir work cut out for them.\r\n\r\nThey had.\r\n\r\nThe top-gallant sail had taken charge of itself, and Raft and Ponting as\r\nthey lay out on the yard seemed battling with a thing alive,\r\nintelligent, and desperately wicked.\r\n\r\nThe sail snored and trembled and sang, standing out in great hoods and\r\nfolds, hard as steel; now it would yield, owing to a slackening of the\r\nwind, and then, like a brute that had only been waiting to take them by\r\nsurprise, it would burst out again, releasing itself, whilst the yard\r\nbuckled and sprang, almost casting them from it.\r\n\r\nThen began a battle fought without a sound or cry except the bubbling\r\nand snoring of the great sail struggling for its wicked liberty, it\r\nshrank and they flung themselves on it, it bellied and flung them back,\r\nclinging to the lift they saved themselves, attacking it again with the\r\ndumb fury of dogs or wolves on a fighting prey. Twenty times it tried to\r\ndestroy them and twenty times they all but had it under.\r\n\r\nThe fight died out of the monster for a moment and Raft had nearly an\r\narmful of it in when it stiffened, fighting free of him, owing to\r\nPonting and the other fellow not having made good. They clung for a\r\nmoment without moving, resting, and Raft glancing down saw far away\r\nbelow the narrow deck driving wedge-like through the foam-capped seas.\r\n\r\nThen the struggle began again. The sail, like its would-be captors,\r\nseemed also to have taken breath, it held firm, relaxed, banged out\r\nagain in thunder, developed new hoods and folds as a struggling monster\r\nmight develop new heads and kinks, and then, all of a sudden when it\r\nseemed that no effort was of avail the end came.\r\n\r\nThe wind paused for a moment, as if gathering up all its strength\r\nagainst the dogged persistency which is man, and in that moment the\r\nthree on the yard had the sail under their chests beating and crushing\r\nthe life out of it. Then the gaskets were passed round it and they clung\r\nfor a moment to rest and breathe.\r\n\r\nIt was nothing, or they thought nothing of it, this battle for life with\r\na monster, just the stowing of a top-gallant sail in dirty weather, and\r\nmost likely when they got down the Bo'sw'n would call them farmers for\r\nbeing such a time over it. Meanwhile they clung idly for a moment,\r\npartly to rest and partly to look at something worth seeing.\r\n\r\nThe squall was blowing out, there was nothing behind it and away on the\r\nport quarter the almost setting sun had broken through the smother and\r\nwas lighting the sea.\r\n\r\nThere, set in a thousand square acres of snowcapped tourmaline, white as\r\na gull and beautiful as grace itself, was running a vessel under bare\r\npoles. The two yellow funnels, the cut of the hull, told Ponting what\r\nshe was. He had seen her twice before and no sailor who had once set\r\neyes on her could forget her.\r\n\r\n\"See that blighter,\" he yelled across to Raft. \"Know her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Should think I did, she's the _Gaston de Paree_--a yacht--seen her in\r\nT'lon.\"\r\n\r\nThen they came down, crawling like weary men, and on deck no one abused\r\nthem for their slackness or the time they'd been over their job. The\r\n_Albatross_ was running easy and the Bo'sw'n with others was taken up\r\nwith a momentary curiosity over the great white yacht.\r\n\r\nNo one knew her but Ponting, who had for several years acted as deck\r\nhand on some of the Mediterranean boats.\r\n\r\n\"I know her,\" said he ranging up beside the others. \"She's the _Gaston\r\nde Paree_, a yot--seen her in T'lon harbour and seen her again at Suez,\r\nshe's a thousand tonner, y'can't mistake them funnels nor the width of\r\nthem, she's a twenty knotter and the chap that owns her is a king or\r\nsomethin'; last time I saw her she was off to the China seas, they say\r\nshe's all cluttered up with dredges and dipsy gear, and she mostly\r\nspends her time takin' soundin's and scrabblin' up shell fish and\r\nsuch--that's his way of amusin' himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then he must be crazy,\" said the Bo'sw'n, \"but b'God he's got a beauty\r\nunder him--what's he doin' down here away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ax me another,\" said Ponting. Raft stood with the others, watching the\r\n_Gaston de Paris_ from whose funnels now the smoke was coming festooned\r\non the wind, then he went below to shed his oilskins and smoke.\r\n\r\nShe had ceased to interest him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GASTON DE PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Ponting was right in all his particulars, except one. The owner of\r\nthe _Gaston de Paris_ was not a king, only a prince.\r\n\r\nPrince Selm, a gentleman like his Highness of Monaco with a passion for\r\nthe deep sea and its exploration. The Holy Roman Empire had given his\r\ngreat grandfather the title of prince, and estates in Thuringia gave him\r\nmoney enough to do what he pleased, an unfortunate marriage gave him a\r\ndistaste for High Civilization, and his scientific bent and passion for\r\nthe sea--inherited with a strain of old Norse blood--did the rest.\r\n\r\nHe had chosen well. Cards, women and wine, pleasure and the glittering\r\nthings of life, all these betray one, but the sea, though she may kill,\r\nnever leaves a man broken, never destroys his soul.\r\n\r\nBut Eugene Henry William of Selm for all this sea passion might have\r\nremained a landsman, for the simple reason that he was one of those\r\nthorough souls for whom Life and an Object are synonymous terms. In\r\nother words he would never have made a yachtsman, a creature shifting\r\nfrom Keil to Cowes and Cowes to Naples according to season, a cup\r\ngatherer and club-house haunter.\r\n\r\nBut Exploration gave him the incentive and the Musée Océanographique of\r\nMonaco his inspiration, limitless wealth supplied the means.\r\n\r\nThe _Gaston de Paris_ built by Viguard of Toulon was an ocean going\r\nsteam yacht of twelve hundred and fifty tons with engines by Conturier\r\nof Nantes and everything of the latest from Conturier's twin-action\r\ncentrifugal bilge pumps to the last thing in sea valves. She was\r\nreckoned by those who knew her the finest sea-going yacht in the world\r\nand she was certainly the _chef-d'oeuvre_ of Lafiette, Viguard's chief\r\ndesigner. Lafiette was more than a designer, he was a creator, the sea\r\nwas in his blood giving him that touch of genius or madness, that\r\nsomething eccentric which made him at times cast rules and formulae\r\naside.\r\n\r\nThe decks of the _Gaston de Paris_ ran flush, with little encumbrance\r\nsave a deck-house forward given over to electrical and deep sea\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nForward of the engine room and right to the bulkheads of the fo'c'sle\r\nran a lower deck reached by a hatch aft of the instrument room. Here\r\nwere stowed the dredges and buoys and all the gear belonging to them,\r\ntrawl nets and deep sea traps, cable and spare rope and sounding-wire,\r\nharpoons and grancs and a hundred odds and ends, all in order and spick\r\nand span as the gear of a warship.\r\n\r\nAft of the engine-room the yacht was a little palace. Prince Selm would\r\nlabour like any of his crew over a net coming in or in an emergency, but\r\nhe ate off silver and slept between sheets of exceedingly fine linen.\r\nThough a sailor, almost one might say a fisherman, he was always\r\nMonsieur le Prince and though his hobby lay in the depths of the sea his\r\nintellect did not lie there too. Politics, Literature and Art travelled\r\nwith him as mind companions, whilst in the flesh he often managed to\r\nbring off with him on his \"outlandish expeditions\" more or less pleasant\r\npeople from the great world where Civilisation sits in cities, feeding\r\nArt and Philosophy, Science and Literature with the hearts and souls of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe main saloon of the _Gaston de Paris_ fought in all its details\r\nagainst the idea of shipboard life, the gilt and scrolls of the yacht\r\ndecorator, the mirrors, and all the rest of his abominations were not to\r\nbe found here, panels by Chardin painted for Madame de Pompadour\r\noccupied the walls, the main lamp, a flying dragon by Benvenuto Cellini,\r\nclutching in its claws a globe of fire, had, for satellites, four torch\r\nbearers of bronze by Claus, a library, writing and smoking room,\r\ncombined, opened from the main saloon, and there was a boudoir decorated\r\nin purple and pearl with flower pictures by Lactropius unfaded despite\r\ntheir date of 1685.\r\n\r\nNothing could be stranger to the mind than the contrast between the\r\nfo'c'sle of the _Albatross_ and the after cabins of the _Gaston_,\r\nnothing, except, maybe, the contrast between a garret in Montmartre or\r\nStepney and a drawing-room in the Avenue du Trocadéro or Mayfair.\r\n\r\nDinner was served on board the _Gaston de Paris_ at seven, and to-night\r\nthe Prince and his four guests, seated beneath the flying dragon of\r\nCellini and enjoying their soup, held converse together light-heartedly\r\nand with a spirit that had been somewhat lacking of late. Every sea\r\nvoyage has its periods of depression due to monotony; they had not\r\nsighted a ship for over ten days, and this evening the glimpse of the\r\n_Albatross_ revealed through the break in the weather had in some\r\ncurious way shattered the sense of isolation and broken the monotony.\r\nThe four guests of the Prince were: Madame la Comtesse de Warens, an old\r\nlady with a passion for travel, a free thinker, whose mother was a\r\nfriend of Voltaire in her youth and whose father had been a member of\r\nthe Jacobin club; she was eighty-four years of age, declared herself\r\nindestructible by time, and her one last ambition to be a burial at sea.\r\nShe was also a Socialistic-Anarchist, possessed an income of some forty\r\nthousand pounds a year derived from speculations of her late husband\r\nconducted during the war with Germany in 1870, yet was never known to\r\ngive a sou to charity; her hands were all but the hands of a skeleton\r\nand covered with jewels, she smoked cigarettes incessantly. She was one\r\nof those old women whose energy seems to increase with age, tireless as\r\na gnat she was always the last in bed and the first on deck, though\r\nlying in her bunk half the night reading French novels of which she had\r\na trunkful and smoking her eternal cigarettes.\r\n\r\nBeside her sat her niece, Cléo de Bromsart, English on the mother's side\r\nand educated in England, a girl of twenty, unmarried, dark-haired,\r\nfragile and beautiful as a dream. She was one of the old nobility,\r\nwithout dilution, yet strangely enough with money, for the Bromsarts,\r\nwithout marrying into trade, had adapted themselves to the new times so\r\ncleverly that Eugène de Bromsart the last of his race had retired from\r\nlife leaving his only daughter and the last of her race wealthy, even by\r\nthe standard of wealth set in Paris. She was a sportswoman and, despite\r\nher lack of frailty, had led an outdoor life and possessed a nerve of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nMadame de Warens had brought the girl up after she left school, had\r\nlaboured over her and found her labour in vain. Cléo had no leanings\r\ntowards the People and the opinions of her aunt seemed to her a sort of\r\ndisreputable madness bred on hypocrisy. Cléo looked on the lower classes\r\njust as she looked on animals, beings with rights of their own but\r\nbelonging to an entirely different order of creation, and one thing\r\ncertainly could be said for her--she was honest in her outlook on life.\r\n\r\nBeside her sat Doctor Epinard, the ship's doctor, a serious young man\r\nwho spoke little, and the fifth at table was Lagross, the sea painter,\r\nwho had come for the sake of his health and to absorb the colours of the\r\nocean. The vision of the _Albatross_ with towering canvas breasting the\r\nblue-green seas in an atmosphere of sunset and storm was with him still\r\nas he sat listening to the chatter of the others and occasionally\r\njoining in. He intended to paint that picture.\r\n\r\nIt had come to him as a surprise. They had been playing cards when a\r\nquarter-master called them on deck saying that the weather had moderated\r\nand that there was a ship in sight, and there, away across the tumbling\r\nseas, the _Albatross_ had struck his vision, remote, storm surrounded,\r\nand sunlit, almost a vision of the past in these days of mechanism.\r\n\r\n\"Now tell me, Prince,\" Madame de Warens was saying, \"how long do you\r\npropose staying at this Kerguelen Land of yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than a week,\" replied the Prince. \"I want to take some\r\nsoundings off the Smoky Islands and I shall put in for a day on the\r\nmainland where you can go ashore if you like, but I shan't stay here\r\nlong. It is like putting one's head into a wolf's mouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Weather. You saw that sudden squall we passed through this evening, or\r\nrather you heard it, no doubt, well that's the sort of thing Kerguelen\r\nbrews.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose,\" said the astute old lady, \"it brewed one of those things,\r\nonly much worse, and we were blown ashore?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our engines can fight anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there any natives in this place?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only penguins and rabbits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" said Lagross, \"that three-master we saw just now, would she\r\nbe making for Kerguelen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, she must be out of her course and beating up north. She's not a\r\nwhaler, and ships like that would keep north of the Crozets. Probably\r\nshe was driven down by that big storm we had a week ago. We wouldn't be\r\nwhere we are only that I took those soundings south of Marion Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, after Kerguelen, what land shall we see next?\" asked the old lady.\r\n\r\n\"New Amsterdam, madame,\" replied the Prince, \"and after that the Sunda\r\nIslands and beautiful Java with its sun and palm trees.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Bromsart shivered slightly. She had been silent up to\r\nthis, and she spoke now with eyes fixed far away as if viewing the\r\npicture of Java with its palms and sapphire skies.\r\n\r\n\"Could we not go there now?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\" asked the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Turn the ship round and leave this place behind,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said she, \"perhaps it is what you say about Kerguelen,\r\nor perhaps it was the sight of that big ship all alone out there, but I\r\nfeel--\" she stopped short.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--\"\r\n\r\n\"That ship frightened me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frightened you,\" cried Madame de Warens, \"why, Cléo, what is the matter\r\nwith you to-night? You who are never frightened. I'm not easily\r\nfrightened, but I admit I almost said my prayers in that storm, and you,\r\nyou were doing embroidery.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am not frightened of storms or things in the ordinary way,\" said\r\nthe girl half laughing. \"Physical things have no power over me, an ugly\r\nface can frighten me more than the threat of a blow. It is a question of\r\npsychology. That ship produced on my mind a feeling as though I had seen\r\ndesolation itself, and something worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something worse!\" cried Madame de Warens, \"what can be worse than\r\ndesolation?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Cléo, \"It also made me feel that I wanted to be far\r\naway from it and from here. Then, Monsieur le Prince, with his story of\r\ndesolate Kerguelen, completed the feeling. It is strong upon me now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not wish to go to Kerguelen then?\" said the Prince smiling as he\r\nhelped himself to the entrée that was being passed round.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, monsieur, it is not a question of my wishes at all,\" replied the\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\n\"But, excuse me,\" replied the owner of the _Gaston de Paris_, \"it is\r\nentirely a question of your wishes. We are not a cargo boat, Captain\r\nLepine is on the bridge, he has only to go into his chart house, set his\r\ncourse for New Amsterdam, and a turn of the wheel will put our stern to\r\nthe south.\" He touched an electric bell push, attached to the table, as\r\nhe spoke.\r\n\r\n\"And your soundings?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"They can wait for some other time or some other man, sea depths are\r\npretty constant.\"\r\n\r\nA quarter-master appeared at the saloon door, came forward and saluted.\r\n\r\n\"Ask Captain Lepine to come aft,\" said the Prince. \"I wish to speak to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said Mademoiselle Bromsart. Then to her host. \"No. I will not\r\nhave the course altered for me. I am quite clear upon that point. What I\r\nsaid was foolish and it would pain me more than I can tell to have it\r\nacted upon. I really mean what I say.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her for a moment and seemed to glimpse something of the\r\niron will that lay at the heart of her beauty and fragility.\r\n\r\n\"That will do,\" said he to the quarter-master. \"You need not give my\r\nmessage.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Warens laughed. \"That is what it is to be young,\" said she,\r\n\"if an old woman like me had spoken of changing our course I doubt if\r\nyour quarter-master would have been called, Monsieur. But I have no fads\r\nand fancies, thank heaven, I leave all that to the young women of\r\nto-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, madame,\" said Doctor Epinard speaking for almost the first\r\ntime, \"but in impressions produced by objects upon the mind there is no\r\nroom for the term fancy. I speak of course of the normal mind free of\r\ndisease. Furthermore, we talk of objects as things of secondary\r\nimportance and the mind as everything. Now I am firmly convinced that\r\nthe mind of man, so far from being a thing apart from the objects that\r\nform its environment, is, in fact, nothing else but a mirror or focus\r\nupon which objects register their impressions and that all the thinking\r\nin the world is done not really by the mind but by the objects that form\r\nour thoughts and the reasons, utterly divorced from what we call human\r\nreason, that connect together the objects that form our environment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this a theory of your own, Epinard?\" asked the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"It is, monsieur, and it may be bad or good but I adhere to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say that man is composed entirely of environment, past and\r\npresent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsieur, you have caught my meaning exactly. Past and present.\r\nMan is nothing more than a concretion formed from emanations of all the\r\nobjects whose emanations have impinged upon living tissue since, at the\r\nbeginning of the world, living tissue was formed. He is the sunset he\r\nsaw a million years ago, the water he swam in when he was a fish, the\r\nknight in armour he fought with when he was an ancestor, or rather he is\r\na concretion of the light, touch and sound vibrations from these and a\r\nmillion other things. I have written the matter fully out in a thesis,\r\nwhich I hope to publish some day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you may put my name down for a dozen copies,\" said the Prince,\r\n\"for certainly the theory is less mad than some of the theories I have\r\ncome across explaining the origin of mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what has all that to do with the ship?\" asked Madame de Warens.\r\n\r\n\"Simply, madame, that the ship which one looked at as a structure of\r\ncanvas and wood, once seen by Mademoiselle de Bromsart, has become part\r\nof her mind, just as it has become part of yours and mine, a logical and\r\ndefinite part of our minds; now, mark me, there was also the sunset and\r\nthe storm clouds, those objects also became part of the mind of\r\nMademoiselle de Bromsart, and the reasons interlying between all these\r\nobjects produced in her a definite and painful impression. They were, in\r\nfact, all thinking something which she interpreted.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me,\" said the girl, \"that I saw Loneliness itself, and for\r\nthe first time, and I felt just now that it was following me. It was to\r\nescape from that absurd phantom that I suggested to Monsieur le Prince\r\nthat we should alter our course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Madame de Warens, \"your will has conquered the Phantom. Let\r\nus talk of something more cheerful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" said Mademoiselle de Bromsart. \"It seems to me that the\r\nengines are going slower.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have a quick ear, mademoiselle,\" said the Prince, \"they undoubtedly\r\nare. The Captain has reduced speed. Kerguelen is before us, or rather\r\non our starboard bow, and daybreak will, no doubt, give us a view of it.\r\nWe do not want to be too close to it in the dark hours, that is why\r\nspeed has been reduced.\"\r\n\r\nCoffee was served at table and presently, amidst the fumes of cigarette\r\nsmoke, the conversation turned to politics, the works of Anatole France,\r\nand other absorbing subjects. One might have fancied oneself in Paris\r\nbut for the vibrations of the propeller, the heave of the sea, and the\r\nhundred little noises that mark the passage of a ship under way.\r\n\r\nLater Mademoiselle de Bromsart found herself in the smoking-room alone\r\nwith her host, Madame de Warens having retired to her state-room and the\r\nothers gone on deck.\r\n\r\nThe girl was doing some embroidery work which she had fetched from her\r\ncabin and the Prince was glancing at the pages of the Revue des Deux\r\nMondes. Presently he laid the book down.\r\n\r\n\"I was in earnest,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" she asked, glancing up from her work.\r\n\r\n\"When I proposed altering the course. Nothing would please me more than\r\nto spoil a plan of my own to please you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is good of you to say that,\" she replied, \"all the same I am glad I\r\ndid not spoil your plan, not so much for your sake as my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would rather die than run away from danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you feared danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I did not fear it, but I felt it. I felt a premonition of danger. I\r\ndid not say so at dinner. I did not want to alarm the others.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her curiously for a moment, contrasting her fragility and\r\nbeauty with the something unbendable that was her spirit, her soul--call\r\nit what you will.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said he, \"your slightest wish is my law. I have been going to\r\nspeak to you for the last few days. I will say what I want to say now.\r\nIt is only four words. Will you marry me?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him, meeting his eyes full and straight.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, \"it is impossible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have a very great regard for you--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not love me?\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing, going on with her work calmly as though the\r\nconversation was about some ordinary topic.\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why you should,\" he went on, \"but look around you--how many\r\npeople marry for love now-a-days--and those who do, are they any the\r\nhappier? I have seen a very great deal of the world and I know for a\r\nfact that happiness in marriage has little to do with what the poets\r\ncall love and everything to do with companionship. If a man and woman\r\nare good companions then they are happy together, if not they are\r\nmiserable, no matter how much they may love one another at the start.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen much of the world?\" she raised her eyes again as she\r\nasked the question. \"Have you seen anything really of the world? I do\r\nnot mean to be rude, but this world of ours, this world of society that\r\nholds us all, is there anything real about it, since nearly everything\r\nin it is a sham? Look at the lives we lead, look at Paris and London and\r\nBerlin. Why the very language of society is framed to say things we do\r\nnot mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is civilization. How else would you have it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she replied, \"but I do know it is not life. It is\r\ndishonesty. You say that the only happy married people are those that\r\nare good companions, that love does not count in the long run, and you\r\nare right, perhaps, as far as what you call the World is concerned. I\r\nonly repeat that the thing you call the World is not the real world, for\r\nlove is real, and love is not merely a question of good companionship.\r\nIt is an immortal bond between two spirits and death cannot break it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak as though you were very certain of a thing which, of all\r\nthings, is most hidden from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I speak by instinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the Prince, \"perhaps you are right. We have left behind us\r\nthe simplicity of the old world, we have become artificial, our life is\r\na sham--but what would you have and how are we to alter it? We are all\r\nlike passengers in a train travelling to heaven knows where; the seats\r\nare well cushioned and the dining-car leaves nothing to be desired, but\r\nI admit the atmosphere is stuffy and the long journey has developed all\r\nsorts of unpleasant traits among the passengers--well, what would you\r\ndo? We cannot get out.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose not,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHe rose up and stood for a moment turning over some magazines lying on\r\nthe table. He had received his answer and he knew instinctively that it\r\nwas useless to pursue the business further.\r\n\r\nThen after a few more words he went on deck. The wind had fallen to a\r\nsteady blow but the sky was still overcast and the atmosphere was heavy\r\nand clammy and not consistent. It was as though the low lying clouds\r\ndipped here and there to touch the sea. Every now and then the _Gaston\r\nde Paris_ would run into a wreath of fog and pass through it into the\r\nclear darkness of the night beyond.\r\n\r\nIn the darkness aft of the bridge nothing could be seen but the pale\r\nhint of the bridge canvas and a trace of spars and funnels now wiped out\r\nwith mist, now visible again against the night.\r\n\r\nThe Prince leaned on the weather rail and looked over at the tumble and\r\nsud of the water lit here and there with the gleam of a port light.\r\n\r\nCléo de Bromsart had fascinated him, grown upon him, compelled him in\r\nsome mysterious way to ask her to marry him. He had sworn after his\r\ndisastrous first experience never to marry again. He had attempted to\r\nbreak his oath. Was he in love with her? He could scarcely answer that\r\nquestion himself. But this he knew, that her refusal of him and the\r\nwords she had said were filling his mind with quite new ideas.\r\n\r\nWas she right after all in her statement that he who fancied himself a\r\nman of the world knew nothing of the world except its shams? Was she\r\nright in her statement that love was a bond between two spirits, a bond\r\nunbreakable by death? That old idea was not new to him, he had played\r\nwith it as a toy of the mind constructed for the mind to play with by\r\nthe poets.\r\n\r\nThe new thing was to find this idea in the mind of a young girl and to\r\nhear it expressed with such conviction.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he came forward and went up the steps to the bridge.\r\nCaptain Lepine was in the chart room, the first officer was on the\r\nbridge and Bouvalot, an old navy quarter-master, had the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"We have slowed down,\" said the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, monsieur,\" replied the first officer, \"we are getting close to\r\nland. We ought to sight Kerguelen at dawn.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think of the weather?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think the weather will bother us much, monsieur, that blow had\r\nnothing behind it, and were it not for these fog patches I would ask\r\nnothing better; but then it's Kerguelen--what can one expect!\"\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said the other, \"it's a vile place, by all accounts, as far as\r\nweather is concerned.\"\r\n\r\nHe tapped at the door of the chart room and entered.\r\n\r\nThe chart room of the _Gaston de Paris_ was a pleasant change from the\r\ndark and damp of the bridge. A couch upholstered in red velvet ran along\r\none side of it and on the couch with one leg up and a pipe in his mouth\r\nthe captain was resting himself, a big man of the Southern French navy\r\ntype, with a beard of burnt-up black that reached nearly to his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Prince, telling him not to move, sat down and lit a cigar. Then they\r\nfell into talk.\r\n\r\nLepine was a sailor and nothing else. Had his character been cut out of\r\ncardboard the line of division between the sailor and the rest of the\r\nworld could not have been more sharply marked. That was perhaps why the\r\ntwo men, though divided by a vast social gulf, were friends, almost\r\nchums.\r\n\r\nThey talked for half an hour or so on all sorts of subjects connected\r\nwith the ship.\r\n\r\n\"By the way, Lepine,\" said the Prince suddenly, \"It has been the toss up\r\nof a sou that we are not now steering a course for New Amsterdam.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how is that, monsieur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mademoiselle de Bromsart proposed to me at dinner that we should\r\nalter our course, the idea came to her that some misfortune might happen\r\nto us off Kerguelen and, as you know, I am always anxious to please my\r\nguests--well, I called a quarter-master down. I was going to have sent\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To alter our course?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but Mademoiselle de Bromsart altered her mind. She refused to let\r\nme send for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what gave the young lady that idea?\" asked the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"That big ship we sighted before dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"The three-master?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there was something about it she did not like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur, what an idea--and what was wrong with it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was just a fancy. The sea breeds fancies and superstitions, you\r\nknow that, Lepine, for I believe you are superstitious yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, monsieur; all sailors are, and I have had experiences. There\r\nare bad and good ships, just as there are bad and good men, of that I am\r\nsure. Perhaps that three-master was a bad ship.\" Lepine laughed as\r\nthough at his own words. \"All the same,\" he went on, \"I don't like\r\nwarnings, especially off Kerguelen.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the chart house and came out on the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe wind was still steady but the clouds had consolidated and the night\r\nwas pitch black. On the bridge the _Gaston de Paris_ seemed driving into\r\na solid wall of ebony.\r\n\r\nThe Prince after a glance into the binnacle was preparing to go down the\r\nbridge steps when a cry from the Look-out made him wheel round.\r\nSuddenly, and as if evolved by magic from the blackness, the vague\r\nspectre of a vast ship shewed up ahead on the port bow making to cross\r\ntheir course. Thundering along under full canvas without lights and\r\nseemingly blind, she seemed only a pistol shot away.\r\n\r\nThen the owner of the _Gaston de Paris_ did what no owner ought ever to\r\ndo: seeing Destruction and judging that by a bold stroke it might be\r\nout-leaped, he sprang to the engine room telegraph and flung the lever\r\nto full speed ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDISASTER\r\n\r\n\r\nLeft alone, Mademoiselle de Bromsart finished the all but completed\r\npiece of embroidery in her lap. It did not take her five minutes. Then\r\nshe held up the work and reviewed it with lips slightly pursed, then she\r\nrolled it up, rose, and went off to the state-room of Madame de Warens\r\nto bid her good-night.\r\n\r\nMadame was sitting up in her bunk reading Maurice Barres' \"Greco.\" The\r\nair of the place was stifling with the fume of cigarettes, and the girl\r\nnearly choked as she closed the door and stood facing the old lady in\r\nthe bunk.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you smoke, then you wouldn't mind it,\" cried the latter,\r\nputting her book down and taking off her glasses. \"No, I won't have a\r\nport opened, d'you want me to be blown out of my bunk? Sit down.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't stay,\" replied the other, \"I just came to say\r\ngood-night--and tell you something--He asked me to marry him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who--Selm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said 'No.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you did?--and what's the matter with him--I mean what's the matter\r\nwith you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"How! The best match in Europe and you say 'no' to him--a man who could\r\nmarry where he pleases and whom he pleased and you say 'no.'\r\nGood-looking, without vices, richer than many a crowned head, second\r\nonly to the reigning families--and you say 'no.'\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady was working herself up. This admirer of Anarchasis Clootz\r\nand dilletanti of Anarchism had lately possessed one supreme desire, the\r\ndesire to have for niece the Princess Selm.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you didn't believe in all that,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"All what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Titles, wealth and so forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe in seeing you happy and well-placed. I was not thinking of\r\nmyself--well, there, it's done. There is no use in talking any more, for\r\nI know your disposition. You are hard, mademoiselle, that is your\r\nfailing--without real heart. It is the modern disease. Well, that is all\r\nI have to say. I wish you good-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe put on her spectacles again.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" said the other.\r\n\r\nShe went out, closed the door, and entered her state-room.\r\n\r\nIt was the same as Madame de Warens' only larger, a place to fill the\r\nmind of the old-time seafarers with the wildest surprise, for here was\r\neverything that a mortal could demand in the way of comfort and nothing\r\nof the stuffy upholstery that the word \"state-rooms\" suggests to the\r\nmind of the ordinary traveller.\r\n\r\nThe crimson velvet, so dear to the heart of the ship furnisher, was\r\nsupplanted by ribbed silk, Persian rugs covered the floor, the metal\r\nfittings were of bronze, and worked, where possible, into sea designs:\r\ndolphins, sea-horses, and fucus. There was a writing-table that could be\r\nclosed up into the wall so cunningly that no trace was left of where it\r\nhad been, a tiny library of slim volumes uniformly bound in amber\r\nleather, a miracle of binding, the work of Grossart of Tours, a map-rack\r\ncontaining large scale maps of the world, and a tell-tale compass\r\nshewing the course of the _Gaston de Paris_ to whomever cared to read\r\nit. A long mirror let into the bulkhead aft increased the apparent size\r\nof the place. A bath-room and dressing-room lay forward.\r\n\r\nHaving closed the door she stood for a moment glancing at her reflection\r\nin the mirror. The picture seemed to fascinate her as though it were the\r\nreflection of some stranger. Then, turning from the mirror, she sat down\r\nfor a moment on the couch by the door.\r\n\r\nShe felt disturbed. The words of Madame de Warens had angered her,\r\nproducing the effect of a false accusation to which one is too proud to\r\nreply, but the momentary anger had passed, giving place to a craving for\r\nfreedom and fresh air. The atmosphere of the state-room felt stifling,\r\nshe would go on deck. Then she remembered that she was in a thin evening\r\ndress and that she would have to change.\r\n\r\nThe two women shared a maid, and she was in the act of stretching out\r\nher hand to the electric bell by the couch to summon the maid, when the\r\ncraving to get on deck without delay became so strong that she rose,\r\nwent into the dressing-room and, without assistance, changed her gown\r\nfor a tweed coat and skirt and her thin evening shoes for a pair of\r\nserviceable boots. Then she slipped on her oilskin and sou'wester and\r\ncoming back into the state-room caught a momentary glimpse of herself in\r\nthe mirror, a strange contrast to the elegant and black-gowned figure\r\nthat had glanced at its reflection only ten minutes before.\r\n\r\nShe was coming up the saloon companion-way when the engines, easily\r\nheard from here, suddenly began a thunderous pow-wow; the ship lurched\r\nforward, and from the blackness of the open hatch above came a voice\r\nlike the sudden clamour of sea-gulls. Then she was flung backwards and\r\nstretched, half-stunned, on the mat at the companion-way foot.\r\n\r\nFor a moment she did not know in the least what had happened. She\r\nfancied she had slipped and fallen, then, as she scrambled on to her\r\nhands and knees, someone passed her, nearly treading on her, and rushed\r\nup the companion-way to the deck. It was the chief steward. Rising and\r\nholding on to the rail she followed him.\r\n\r\nThe deck was aslant, and in the windy blackness of the night nothing was\r\nto be seen for a moment; but the darkness was terrific with voices,\r\nvoices from forward of the bridge and voices from alongside as though a\r\nhundred drunken sailors were yelling and blaspheming from a quay.\r\n\r\nFor the tenth of a second the idea of being alongside a quay came to her\r\nwith nightmare effect, heightened by a ruffling and booming from the sky\r\nabove, a rippling and flapping and thundering like the sound of vast and\r\ntangled wings.\r\n\r\nThen a blaze of light shot out, making day.\r\n\r\nThe arc lamp of the fore-mast, always ready to be used for night work,\r\nhad been run up and switched on.\r\n\r\nTo starboard and stern of the _Gaston de Paris_, a great ship, within\r\npistol shot of the deck, and with her canvas spilling the wind and\r\nthrashing and thundering, was dipping her bows in the sea. Men were\r\nfighting for the boats, and the stern was so high that more than half of\r\nthe rudder shewed like a great door swinging on its hinges. On the\r\ncounter in pale letters the word\r\n\r\n    \"_Albatross_\"\r\n\r\nshewed, and to the mind of the gazer all the horror seemed focussed in\r\nthat calm statement, those commonplace letters written upon destruction.\r\n\r\nClinging to the hatch combing she saw, now, as a person sees in a dream,\r\nsailors rushing and struggling aft along the slanting main deck. The\r\nengines had ceased working but the dynamos were running on steam from\r\nthe main boilers, and through the noises that filled the night the\r\nsewing machine sound of them threshed like a pulse. What had happened,\r\nwhat was happening, she did not know. The great ship to port seemed\r\nsinking but the _Gaston de Paris_ seemed safe, but for the horrible\r\nslant of the decks; she called out to the sailors, now clustered here\r\nand there by the boat davits, but her voice blew away on the wind, she\r\nsaw Prince Selm, he was struggling aft along the slippery sloping deck,\r\nclutching at the bulwarks as he came, he seemed like a man engaged in\r\nsome fantastic game--an unreal figure, now he was on the deck on all\r\nfours, now up again, clutching men by the shoulders, shaking them,\r\nshouting. She could hear his voice. The starboard boats were unworkable\r\nowing to the list to port. She did not know that, she only knew, and now\r\nfor the first time, that the _Gaston de Paris_ was in fearful danger.\r\nAnd instantly the thought came to her of the old woman below in her bunk\r\nand, on the thought, the mad instinct to rush below and save her.\r\n\r\nHolding on to the woodwork of the hatch she was crawling towards the\r\nopening when blackness hit her like a blow between the eyes. The arc\r\nlamp had gone out, the dynamos had ceased running.\r\n\r\nOn the stroke of the darkness the _Gaston de Paris_ heeled slightly\r\ndeeper, flinging her to her knees, and as she hung, clutching the\r\nwoodwork, she heard her name.\r\n\r\nIt was the Prince's voice. She answered, and at once on her answer a\r\nhand seized her cruelly as a vice. It caught her by the shoulder. She\r\nfelt herself dragged along, buffeted, lifted, cast down--then nothing\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nVOICES IN THE NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boat tackle of the _Gaston de Paris_ was the latest patent\r\narrangement for lowering boats in a hurry; every boat was provisioned,\r\nand the water casks left nothing to be desired, there were frequent\r\ninspections and boat drills. Yet when the _Gaston de Paris_ foundered\r\nonly three souls were saved.\r\n\r\nThe starboard boats, owing to the list, could not be lowered at all;\r\nevery boat had its canvas cover on, which did not expedite matters. The\r\npatent tackle developed defects in practise, and, to crown all, the men\r\npanicked owing to the sudden darkness that fell on them like a clap on\r\nthe extinction of the electric light. The port quarter-boat into which\r\nthe girl had been flung had two men in her and was lowered away by\r\nPrince Selm, the doctor and the first officer; panic had herded the rest\r\nof the hands towards the pinnace and forward boats, and the pinnace,\r\nover-crowded, was stoved by the sea as soon as she was water-bourne. The\r\nother boats never left their davits, they went with the ship when the\r\ndecks opened and the boilers saluted the night with a column of coloured\r\nsteam and a clap of thunder that resounded for miles.\r\n\r\nThe whole tragedy from impact to explosion lasted only seven minutes.\r\n\r\nThe two men in the boat with the girl had shoved off like demons and\r\ntaken to the oars as soon as the falls were released. If they had not,\r\nbeing so short-handed for the size of the boat, they would have been\r\nstoved; as it was they were nearly wrecked by a balk of timber from the\r\nexplosion. It missed them by a short two fathoms, drenching them with\r\nspray, and then the night shut down pierced by voices, voices of men\r\nswimming and crying for help.\r\n\r\nThe rowers did not know each other. The bow oar shouted to the stern.\r\n\"Is that you Larsen?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Bompard, and you?\"\r\n\r\n\"La Touche--Row--God! Listen, there's a chap ahead.\"\r\n\r\nThe cries ahead ceased, and the boat bumped on something that duddered\r\naway under it and sank.\r\n\r\n\"He's gone, whoever he is,\" cried Bompard. \"No use hunting for him.\r\nListen, there's more.\" Voices shrill and voices bubbling came through\r\nthe blackness from here and from there. The men tried to locate them and\r\nrowed now in this direction, now in that--always wrong. Once a voice\r\nsudden and shrill and close to the boat cried \"A moi,\" and at the same\r\ninstant Bompard's oar struck something, but they found nothing, the\r\nvoice had ceased.\r\n\r\nThey could see, now, the waves like spectres evolving themselves from\r\nthe night, a vision touching the very limit of dimness, and now as they\r\nentered a mist patch--nothing. The voices to port and starboard were\r\nceasing, one by one--being blotted out. Then silence fell, broken only\r\nby the sound of the oars. La Touche shouted and shouted again, but there\r\ncame no response. Then came Bompard's voice. \"Is that hooker gone, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Curse her, yes. I was the lookout. Sailing without lights.\"\r\n\r\n\"This woman seems dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the girl. I heard her squeal out as they hove her in. Let her lie.\r\nWell, this is a start.\"\r\n\r\n\"A black job, but we're out of it, so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, as far as we've got--as far as we've got. Well, there's no use\r\nrowing, there's no sea to hurt her, let her toss.\"\r\n\r\nThe oars came in and the fellows slithered from their seats on to the\r\nbottom boards. Ballasted so the boat rode easy. They lay like shivering\r\ndogs, grumbling and cursing and then, as they lay, the talk went on.\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu! What a thing--but we've grub and water all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, the boats are all right for that.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence and then La Touche began in a high complaining\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"I was lookout, but it was not my fault, that I swear. I saw nothing\r\ntill a big three-master broke out of the smother making to cross our\r\nbows, no lights shewing, snoring along asleep. Then I shouted. The\r\nbridge had seen her too and put the engines full speed ahead. They'd\r\nmistaken the distance, thought to clear her. I got aft. Hadn't reached\r\nthe port alley way when the smash came. It was all the fault of those\r\nfools on the bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows,\" came Bompard's voice. \"Things happen and what is to be must\r\nbe. Well, they're all gone a hundred fathoms deep and here we are\r\ndrifting about with a dead woman. I'd sooner have any other cargo if I\r\nwas given my choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure she's dead?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, she's dead sure enough by the way she's lying, not a breath in\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nNeither man suggested that she should be cast over. She ballasted the\r\nboat, and for Bompard she was something to lean against.\r\n\r\nThe French mercantile marine is divided into two great classes, the\r\nnortherners and southerners. The man from the north is a Ponantaise, the\r\nman from the south a Moco.\r\n\r\nBompard was a Moco, La Touche a Ponantaise. They talked and talked,\r\nrepeating themselves, cursing the \"hooker,\" the Bridge and the\r\nsteersman. Once La Touche, grown hysterical, seemed choking against\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nThen after a while, conversation died out. They had nothing more to talk\r\nabout. The boat rode easy. There was nothing to do, and these men blunt\r\nto life and sea-hardened so that to them all things came in the hour's\r\nwork, nodded off, La Touche curled up in the bow, Bompard with his\r\ngrizzled head on the breast of Mademoiselle de Bromsart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDAWN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe girl was not dead as Bompard imagined, she had been stunned and had\r\npassed from that condition into the pseudo-sleep that follows profound\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nShe was awakened by a flick of spray on her face, a touch from the great\r\nsea that had claimed her for its own.\r\n\r\nLying as she was she could see nothing but the ribbed sides of the boat,\r\nthe grey sky above, and a gull with domed wings and down-curved head,\r\npoised, as though suspended on the end of a string. It screamed at her,\r\nshifted its position, and then passed, as though blown away on the wind.\r\nShe sat up. Bompard had drawn away from her and was lying curled up on\r\nhis side. La Touche on his back, forward, shewed nothing but his knees;\r\nacross the gunnel lay the sea, desolate in the dawn, turbulent, yet\r\nhard and mournful as a view of slated roofs after rain.\r\n\r\nShe had never seen the sea so close before, she had never smelt its\r\nheart and the savour of its soul; bitter, fresh, new and ever renewed by\r\nthe blowing wind.\r\n\r\nThe whole tragedy of the night was alive in her mind as a picture, but\r\nit seemed the picture of what another person had seen. Her past life,\r\nher own personality, seemed vague and unconnected with her as the past\r\nlife and personality of another person. This was reality. Reality new,\r\nterrific, pungent as that which the soul may experience on awakening\r\nafter death.\r\n\r\nShe knew, as though the desolate sea had told her, that the great yacht\r\nwas gone and everyone on board of her; yet the fact, perhaps from its\r\nvery enormity, failed to realize itself fully in her mind. Then, in a\r\nflash and horribly clearly, came the picture of her immediate\r\nenvironment on board the _Gaston de Paris_, quite little things and\r\nthings more important: the silver-plated taps of the bath in the\r\nbath-room, adjoining her cabin, the silk curtains of her bunk, the\r\nhundred and one trifles that made for comfort and ease. She saw the\r\ncabin servants and the face of the chief steward, a fat pale-faced man,\r\na typical _maître d'hôtel_; the dinner of the night before, when the\r\npeople seemed to her phantoms and the food, table equipage, knives,\r\nforks and spoons, realities.\r\n\r\nAll these things stood forth against the blankness and desolation of the\r\nsea, the sea she could touch by dipping her hand over the gunnel, the\r\nsea that had stripped her of everything but life and body, the dress and\r\nboots she wore and the yellow oilskin coat that covered her. Her hand\r\nresting on the gunnel shewed her that she still wore her rings,\r\nexquisite rings of emerald, ruby and diamonds, fresh washed with spray.\r\nThey held her eyes as her mind, swaying just as the boat swayed to the\r\nswell, tried to re-construct yesterday and to feel.\r\n\r\nHorror, pity for the fate of the others, the sense of the great disaster\r\nthat had happened to the _Gaston de Paris_, of these only the latter\r\npossessed any vitality in her mind. The feeling of unreality destroyed\r\nher grip upon all else.\r\n\r\nHer mind was subdued to her own condition. The hard angles of the\r\nwoodwork against which she leaned and the spray upon her face, the boat\r\nand the men in it, the sharp cut wave tops--these were real, with an\r\nappalling reality.\r\n\r\nIt was as though she had never come across a real thing before, and\r\nacross her mind came a vague, vague recognition of that great truth that\r\nreal things bruise one, eat at one, try to make one their own, once they\r\nmanage to break down the barrier of custom that separates the false from\r\nthe true; that quite common things have a power greater than the power\r\nof mind, that only amidst the falsity of civilised life and the stage\r\nare the properties subordinate to the persons and emotions of the\r\nactors.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Bompard, suddenly moving in his sleep, roused himself and\r\nsat up. His rough, weather beaten face was expressionless for a moment,\r\nthen his eyes fell on the girl and recognition seemed to come to him.\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu,\" cried the old fellow as if addressing some unseen person.\r\n\"'Tis all true then--\" Then, as though remembering something--\"but how\r\nis mademoiselle alive?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the girl, unconscious as to what he was referring\r\nto. \"I know you, I have seen you often on deck--who is the other man?\r\nOh, is it possible that we are the only people left?\"\r\n\r\nBompard, without replying, swung his head round, then he rose and came\r\nover the thwarts. He caught La Touche by the leg.\r\n\r\n\"Gaston--rouse up--the lady is alive. It's me. Bompard.\"\r\n\r\nLa Touche sat up, his hair towsled, his face creased, he seemed furious\r\nabout something and pushing Bompard away stared round and round at sea\r\nand sky as if in search of someone.\r\n\r\n\"Bon Dieu,\" cried La Touche. \"The cursed boat.\" He spat as though\r\nsomething bitter were in his mouth and wiped his lips with the back of\r\nhis hand. He did not seem to care a button whether the lady were alive\r\nor not. He had been dreaming that he was in a tavern, just raising a\r\nglass to his mouth, and Bompard had awakened him to this.\r\n\r\nThe girl could not repeat the question to which there seemed no answer,\r\nshe crawled into the stern sheets and sitting there, half bent, watched\r\nthe two men. An observer perched in the sky above might have noticed the\r\ncurious fact that on board the forsaken boat quarter deck and fo'c'sle\r\nstill held sway, that the lady was the lady and the hands the hands,\r\nthat Bompard was talking in an undertone, saying to La Touche: \"Come,\r\nget alive, get alive,\" and that La Touche, after his first outburst, was\r\nholding himself in. They were old yachtsmen, no disaster could shake\r\nthat fact.\r\n\r\nLa Touche, rising and taking his seat on a thwart and looking everywhere\r\nbut in the direction of the girl, as though ashamed of something, began\r\ncutting up some tobacco in a mechanical way, whilst Bompard, on his\r\nknees, was exploring the contents of the forward locker. La Touche was a\r\nfair-haired man, younger than Bompard, a melancholy looking individual\r\nwho always seemed gazing at the worst of things. He spoke now as the\r\ngirl drew his attention to something far away in the east, something\r\nsketched vaguely in the sky as though a picture lay there beyond the\r\nhaze.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's Kerguelen,\" said La Touche.\r\n\r\nBompard, on his knees, and with a maconochie tin in his left hand,\r\nraised his head and looked.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that's Kerguelen,\" said Bompard.\r\n\r\n\"And look,\" said the girl, pointing towards Kerguelen. \"Is not that the\r\nsail of a boat, away ever so far--or is it a gull? Now it's gone. Look,\r\nthere it is again.\"\r\n\r\nBompard looked.\r\n\r\n\"I see nothing,\" said he, \"gull, most like--there wouldn't be any boat\r\nfrom us, they're all gone, unless it was a boat from that hooker we\r\nstruck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boat,\" said La Touche with a dismal laugh. \"She got no boat away, she\r\nwent down by the bows with the fellows like flies on her, this is the\r\nonly boat of the lot that got away.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl with her hand shading her eyes was still looking.\r\n\r\n\"It's gone, whatever it may have been,\" said she, \"can we reach the\r\nland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, mademoiselle,\" said Bompard, \"the wind is setting towards\r\nthere and we have a sail, I am going to step the mast now when I've\r\ntaken stock--well, we won't starve. The tube is provisioned for a full\r\ncrew for a fortnight, water too, we won't starve, that's a fact. La\r\nTouche, get a move on and help me with the sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm coming,\" grumbled La Touche.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the girl that the minds and the tongues and the movements\r\nof the two men were part of some slow-acting, wooden, automatic\r\nmechanism. Whether they reached the land or not seemed a matter almost\r\nof indifference to them. Accustomed to people who talked much and had\r\nmuch to talk about she could not understand. All this was part of the\r\nnew world in which she found herself, part of the boat itself, of the\r\nmast, now stepped against the grey sky, the waves, the gulls, and that\r\ntremendous outline of mountains now more visible to the east--Kerguelen.\r\nA world of things without thought, or all but thoughtless, things that,\r\nyet, dominated mind more profoundly than the power of mind itself.\r\n\r\nBompard was munching a biscuit he had taken from one of the bread bags\r\nas he worked. She noticed the bag, its texture, and the words\r\n\"Traversal--Toulon\" stamped on it. The maconochie tin which he had\r\nplaced on a seat and a tin of beef with a Libby label held her eyes as\r\nthough they were things new and extraordinary. They were. They were\r\nfood. She had never seen food before, food as it really is, the barrier\r\nbetween life and death, food naked and stripped of all pretence.\r\n\r\nBompard coming aft with the sheet shipped the tiller, and, taking his\r\nseat by the girl, put the boat before the wind. La Touche, who had taken\r\nhis seat on the after thwart, was engaged in opening the tin of beef.\r\nThe girl scarcely noticed him. She was experiencing a new sensation, the\r\nsensation of sailing with the wind and the run of the swell. The boat,\r\nfrom a dead thing tossing on the waves, had suddenly become a thing\r\nalive, buoyant, eager and full of purpose, silent, too, for the slapping\r\nand buffeting of the water against the planking had ceased. Running thus\r\nwith the wind and swell there was no opposition, everything was with\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's beef,\" said La Touche who had managed to open the Libby tin,\r\n\"it might be worse.\"\r\n\r\nHe dug out a piece with his knife and presented it to the girl with a\r\nbiscuit, then he helped Bompard and himself, then he scrambled forward,\r\nleaving his beef and biscuit on the thwart, and reappeared with a\r\npannikin of water; it was handed to the lady first.\r\n\r\nThe food seemed to loose their tongues. It was as though the caste\r\ndifference had been broken by the act of eating together.\r\n\r\n\"I'd never thought to set tooth in a biscuit again when that smash came\r\nlast night,\" said Bompard addressing no one in particular.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't thinking of biscuits,\" said La Touche, \"I was bowled over in\r\nthe alley-way. You see, I was running, so it took me harder. What set me\r\nrunning I don't know, my legs took care of themselves--I was just\r\nleaning like this, see, on the look out and between two blinks there was\r\nthe hooker crossing our course or making that way. She'll clear us,\r\nmaybe, said I to myself, then the engines went full speed and I knew we\r\nwere done. Then I cleared aft, running, with no thought in my mind but\r\nto get out of the way, dark, too, but I didn't barge against nothing,\r\ntill the smash came, and I went truck over keel in the alley-way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was coming up the cabin stairs,\" said Cléo, \"and something seemed to\r\nknock me down. Then when I got on deck the light was put on and I saw a\r\ngreat ship on the right hand side; she seemed sinking, but I read her\r\nname, she was quite close. Then the light went out and someone caught me\r\nand threw me--I don't know where, but it must have been into this boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was it,\" said Bompard, talking and eating at the same time, \"us\r\ntwo was in the boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was Larsen,\" cut in La Touche. \"Larsen helped me to get\r\nthe canvas off her, that was when the electric was on--what became of\r\nLarsen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord knows,\" said Bompard. \"I scrambled into her just as the light was\r\nshut off, then the chaps on deck chucked the lady in. Next thing we were\r\nfending her off from the ship. I was shouting to the chaps on deck to\r\njump and we'd pick them up, we'd got the oars out then. I tell you I was\r\nfuddled up for I'd got it in my head that the hooker was to port of us\r\nthough I'd seen her with my own eyes to starboard. I was thinking we'd\r\nbe taken down with the suck of her and I was bent on getting ahead of\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't hear you shouting to the fellows on deck,\" said La Touche,\r\n\"but I heard you shouting to me to row. Then when we'd got her away a\r\nbit the _Gaston_ blew up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blew up,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"The boilers,\" said Bompard, \"they lifted the decks off her. She must\r\nhave gone like a stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you think no one at all escaped but us?\"\r\n\r\nNeither of the men replied for a moment, then La Touche said: \"There\r\nwasn't another boat could have got away.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was well risen now, the clouds were high and breaking and the\r\nfar away land shewed up, vast in the distance, with a white line of\r\nsnow-covered peaks against the sky, desolate as when Kerguelen first\r\nsighted them.\r\n\r\nCléo with her eyes fixed across the leagues of tumbling tourmaline\r\ntinted sea almost forgot the others. That was the place where the wind\r\nwas bearing them to, a place where there was nothing. Neither hotels nor\r\nhouses nor huts, nor men nor women, a place where no landing-stage would\r\nreceive them, no voice welcome them. Her throat worked for a second\r\nconvulsively as she battled with the quite new things that the far off\r\nmountains were telling her.\r\n\r\nIt was now and not till now that she recognised fully what Fate had done\r\nto her. It was now and not till now that she saw Time before her as a\r\nthing from which all the known features had been deleted.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle's bath is quite ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle, the first gong has sounded.\"\r\n\r\nOh, the day--the day with its hundred phases and divisions, the\r\nbreakfast hour, the luncheon hour, the hour that brought afternoon tea,\r\nthe dresses that went with each phase, the emotions and interests, and\r\nchanging forms of being, the day which made a person change to its light\r\nand the person of ten o'clock in the morning quite different from the\r\nperson of noon--this thing which we talk of as the day appeared before\r\nher now as what it really is, life itself, as civilized men know life, a\r\nthing outside ourselves yet of ourselves and without which the circling\r\nof the sun is as the circling of a pointer on a blank dial--. This thing\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nLa Touche had got more forward and was smoking and, though the wind was\r\nwith them, a faint scent of tobacco smoke came on the spill of the wind\r\nfrom the sail. Bompard was chewing, spitting occasionally to starboard\r\nand wiping his mouth with the back of his bronzed tattooed hand.\r\n\r\nThe vague scent of the tobacco threaded up all sorts of things in the\r\ngirl's mind: Madame de Warens, the streets of Paris, the deck of the\r\nyacht. She remembered the piece of embroidery work she had been engaged\r\non last night, and then a scrap of conversation she had overheard\r\nbetween the doctor and the artist towards the end of dinner, they were\r\ntalking of the passéistes and futurists, of the work of Pablo Picasso,\r\nof Sunyer, of Boccioni and Durio, arguing with extraordinary passion\r\nabout the work of these people.\r\n\r\n\"There's weather or something over there,\" said La Touche who had\r\nslipped down and was seated on the bottom boards with his back to a\r\nthwart; he nodded his head towards Kerguelen.\r\n\r\nAround one of the highest peaks a lead-coloured cloud had wrapped itself\r\nturban-wise, and even as they looked the cloud turban increased in\r\nvolume and height, mournful and monstrous as some djin-born vision of\r\nthe Arabian story-tellers.\r\n\r\n\"That's snow,\" said Bompard, \"and by the twist of it it's in a\r\nwhirlwind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bon Dieu, what a place,\" said La Touche.\r\n\r\n\"You may say that,\" said Bompard, \"but that's nothing, it's when we come\r\nto make a landing we'll find what we are against.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we've got so far we'll finish it,\" said La Touche.\r\n\r\nThen began a dismal argument, full of words and repetitions but with few\r\nideas, and from the trend of it the curious fact appeared that La\r\nTouche, the ship's grouser and dismal James, was taking the optimistical\r\nside, whilst Bompard, generally cheerful, was the pessimist.\r\n\r\nLa Touche's optimism was, perhaps, the outcome of fear. What they had\r\ngone through was nothing to the prospect of having to make a landing on\r\nthat tremendous coast, simply because what they had gone through had\r\ncome on them suddenly. This thing had to be faced in cold blood. The\r\ncoward in La Touche refused to face it fully, refused to face the fact\r\nthat with this swell and with all the chances of uncharted and unknown\r\nreefs and rocks the risk was appalling. He grew angry.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be a coward over it,\" said he. That set Bompard off, and for a\r\nmoment the girl thought they would have come to blows. Then it passed\r\nand they were as friendly as before, just as though nothing had\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nTheir talk and the whole business had been conducted as though the girl\r\nwere not there. In the few hours since daybreak, quarter deck and\r\nfo'c'sle had vanished. They had become welded into one community, all\r\nequal, and the lady was no longer the lady. There was no hint of\r\ndisrespect, no hint of respect. They were all equal, equal sharers in\r\nthe chances of the sea.\r\n\r\nMore, the sex standard seemed to have vanished with the social. Nothing\r\nremained but the human, for that is the rule with the open boat at sea.\r\n\r\nWhen they lowered the sail for screening purposes, when they raised it\r\nagain, it was all the same, for the human level is above all little\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nTowards noon and with the coast now closer and well-defined, La Touche\r\nsighted something ahead. It was a rock, high and pointed like a black\r\nspire protruding from the sea and standing there like an outpost of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n\"Had we better give it a wide berth?\" asked La Touche. \"Maybe there's\r\nmore near it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The sea is running smooth enough by it,\" said Bompard. \"I don't see\r\nbreakers, and we don't draw anything to speak of.\" He held on.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shewing through breaks in the high clouds and its light fell\r\non the water and the rock, pied with roosting guillemots. As the boat\r\ndrew near the guillemots gave tongue. The sound came against the wind\r\nfierce and complaining, antagonistic like the voice of loneliness crying\r\nout against them and telling them to be gone--be gone--be gone!\r\n\r\nCléo, as they passed, saw the green water sliding up and falling from\r\nthe polished black rock surface. The sight seemed to bring the hostile\r\ncoast leagues nearer and the bagpipe crying of the guillemots as it died\r\naway behind them seemed a barrier passed, never to be re-crossed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE COAST\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now, away at sea and leagues from the coast they were approaching,\r\nvast islands disclosed themselves suddenly through the sea haze,\r\nstanding like giants waist deep in the ocean, whilst the coast itself\r\nwith its cliffs and rocks of black basalt and dolerite shewed clear,\r\nextraordinarily clear, with every detail defined in the sunlight, from\r\nthe rifts in the basalt to the gulls blowing about in legions and the\r\ngreat sea-geese hovering and fishing.\r\n\r\nThe coast was ferocious, and the whole country from the sea foam to the\r\nfoothills looked tumbled and new, with the newness of infinite\r\nantiquity. The last thunders of creation seemed scarcely to have died\r\naway, the last throe scarcely to have ceased, leaving million-ton rock\r\ncast on rock and the new, shear-cut cliffs spitting back their first\r\ntaste of the bitter sea.\r\n\r\n\"There is nowhere to land,\" said the girl. She was shuddering as a dog\r\nshudders when overstrung.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, it's a brute beast of a place,\" said Bompard, \"well, we must nose\r\nalong on the lookout. There's no coast but hasn't some landing-place\r\nwhere a boat can push in. Y'see it's not like a ship. A boat can go\r\nwhere a ship can't.\"\r\n\r\nHe shifted the helm a bit, keeping the coast parallel to them on the\r\nstarboard side.\r\n\r\n\"Might those islands be better to go to?\" asked she, \"they couldn't be\r\nworse than that.\"\r\n\r\nLa Touche suddenly grew excited. \"Bon Dieu,\" cried he, \"what a thing to\r\nbe saying! Those islands, nothing but rocks--nothing but rocks. Here\r\nthere is land, at all events, good land one can put one's foot on; out\r\nthere there's nothing but rocks. Rather than go out there I would swim\r\nashore--I would--\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, close up,\" said Bompard, \"don't talk about swimming--maybe you'll\r\nhave to.\"\r\n\r\n\"One can always drown,\" said La Touche.\r\n\r\nIt was Bompard who next broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"I've been over cliffs worse than those, for gulls eggs,\" said he, \"take\r\none coast with another, coasts are pretty much the same, you get bad\r\nbits and easy bits, that is all.\"\r\n\r\nLa Touche said nothing.\r\n\r\nAs they drew on the great islands out at sea ranged themselves more\r\ndefinitely and the tremendous coast to starboard shewed more clearly its\r\ndeep cut canons, its sea arches and absolute desolation.\r\n\r\nThe sea had fallen, though the wind still held steady, and this surface\r\ncalmness, under-run by a gentle swell, served only to emphasize the\r\nvastness of the view. The island seemed immensely remote and immense in\r\nsize, the far snow-covered mountains the mountains of a land where\r\ngiants had lived and from which they had departed countless ages ago.\r\n\r\nOyster catches passed the boat with their melancholy cry, but the\r\nfishing gannets and the swimming puffins seemed scarcely to heed the\r\nintruders. Puffins swimming a biscuit toss away as though they had never\r\nlearned the fear of man.\r\n\r\nThey had drawn nearer shore so that the boom of the swell in the caves\r\nand on the rocks came to them with the crying of the shore birds;\r\npassing a headland like a vast lizard they opened a beach curved like\r\nthe new moon and seven miles from horn to horn.\r\n\r\n\"There's our landing-place,\" cried Bompard, \"big enough to pick and\r\nchoose from.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lord!\" shouted La Touche. \"Look over there--moving rocks!\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed half a mile away to seaward.\r\n\r\nBompard looked.\r\n\r\n\"Those crest rocks, they're whales,\" said he.\r\n\r\nA pair of whales shewed, standing up, coupling in the chill blue grey\r\nwater, a miraculous sight, as though they had entered a world where the\r\noriginal things of life still moved and had their being untroubled by\r\nman and untouched by Time.\r\n\r\nBompard shifted the helm, and the boat, heading for the shore and no\r\nlonger running before the wind, moved less easily, shipping an\r\noccasional dash of spray.\r\n\r\nThe change of movement, the dash of spray, the altered course were to\r\nthe girl like the turning of a corner. Running with the wind and with a\r\nparallel shore the boat was the world and the coast and island a\r\npanorama. With the twist of the helm Reality made the coast a\r\ndestination. Up to this moment the uncertainty of whether they could\r\nland had held her mind, up to this moment all sorts of vague\r\npossibilities, the chance of meeting a ship, the chance of being blown\r\nout to sea, the chance of this or that had come between her and the\r\nrealisation of the fact that this prison was hers.\r\n\r\nThe monstrosity of the idea stood fully revealed only now on that beach\r\nwhere there was nothing but sand, nothing but rocks, nothing but gulls.\r\nClose in now Bompard let go the sheet and they unstepped the mast, the\r\nboat rocking in the trough of the swell. Then they got the oars out.\r\n\r\nAs they bent to their work and over the creak of the leather in the\r\nrowlocks the rumble and fume of the seven mile beach came mixed with the\r\nyelping and mewing of the gulls. The boat made slow progress, then a few\r\nyards from the surf line it hung for a moment till the rowers suddenly\r\ngave way and moving like a relieved arrow she came on the crest of a\r\nwave, then the oars came in with a crash and the two men tumbling out\r\ndragged her nose high and dry. They helped the girl out and as they\r\npulled the boat higher she stood, the wind flicking her oilskin coat\r\nabout her and the spindrift blowing in her face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE AWAKENING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great beach of Kerguelen shews above tide mark long stretches where\r\nno sand is, only rock. Basalt planed and smoothed by the seas of\r\ncountless ages, level as a ball-room floor and broken by rifts and pot\r\nholes, between tide marks these pot holes serve as traps for all sorts\r\nof sea creatures. Once the waves must have beaten right up to the low\r\nand broken basalt cliffs full of caves floored with sand, but volcanic\r\naction raising the beach has pushed the tide mark out leaving a shore\r\nvarying in width from half a mile to a few hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThis is the breeding place of the sea elephant. Half way between the\r\nlizard point and the point further to the east a river comes down\r\ndisembarging through three months; on the banks of this river is the\r\nseal nursery where in summer the young sea elephants tumble and play and\r\ntake their swimming lessons, whilst the mothers lie on rocks and the\r\nfathers fish and hunt and fight in battles, the roaring of which\r\nresounds for miles. Here the penguins drill and hold councils and law\r\ncourts and marry and get divorced and hold political meetings, here the\r\nrabbits play and the terns foregather, and here the winds that blow\r\nfrom everywhere but the east, hunt and yell and pile in winter a twenty\r\nfoot sea that breaks in seven miles of thunder under seven miles of\r\nspray thick as the smoke of battle.\r\n\r\nDuck and teal haunt the place and gulls of nearly every known kind snow\r\nit and flick it with movement. Yet above the thunder of the waves and\r\nthe cries of the birds and the shouting of the winds when they blow,\r\nthere hangs a silence--the silence of the remote and prehistoric. The\r\nliving world of men seems cut off from here by far away doors and\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nAfter supper they had explored the cave mouths in the cliff opposite to\r\nwhere the boat had beached. There were three caves just here. One was\r\nimpracticable owing to water dripping from the roof, but the other two,\r\nfloored with hard sand, were good enough for shelter. The men had stowed\r\nthe provisions and themselves in the western mast giving the girl the\r\nother and the boat sail for a pillow.\r\n\r\nIt was old Bompard who thought of the latter. La Touche seemed to have\r\nno thought for any one or anything but himself. He grumbled all the time\r\nduring supper, grumbled at the fact that there was no stuff to make a\r\nfire with, that they had nothing warm to drink, that some time soon\r\ntheir tobacco must run out. It seemed to Cléo as she lay with her head\r\non the hard sailcloth and her body on the hard sand, covered with the\r\noilskin coat which she had taken off to use as a blanket, that through\r\nthe league long rumble of the surf she could hear him grumbling still.\r\nShe did not care. Hard though the floor was she did not mind, she was\r\nchloroformed. Chloroformed by the air of Kerguelen. The air that fills\r\nthe lungs with life, keeps a man going all day with an energy and\r\nbuoyancy unknown elsewhere and then fells him with sleep.\r\n\r\nShe awoke when the whale birds had ceased crying, just after dawn, awoke\r\nfresh and new and full of life. She felt none of that troubled surprise\r\nwhich comes when the mind has to adjust itself to the new situation on\r\nawakening for the first time after a great disaster. It was as though\r\nher mind had already adjusted itself and discounted everything.\r\n\r\nShe rose up and leaving the oilskin coat and sou'wester on the floor of\r\nthe cave came out on to the beach.\r\n\r\nThe fine weather still held and the day was strong, now lighting the\r\nbeach, the sea, and the distant islands through a sky of high, grey\r\neastward drifting clouds. The boat lay where it had been pulled up, the\r\ntide now coming in and legions of birds were flitting and blowing about\r\nand stalking on the sands as far as eye could reach.\r\n\r\nShe came to the cave where the men were. Bompard and La Touche lying on\r\ntheir backs might have been dead but for the sound of their snoring.\r\nBompard was lying with his wrist across his eyes, La Touche with both\r\nhands beside him, clenched. The tins of beef and the bread bags shewed\r\nvaguely in the gloom behind them.\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment watching them and then, turning, she came down to\r\nthe boat lying high and dry on the sand. She was trying to realize, that\r\non the morning of the day before yesterday at this hour she had been\r\nlying in her bunk on board the _Gaston de Paris_, to realize this and\r\nalso the fact that her present position seemed scarcely strange.\r\n\r\nShe ought, so she told herself, to be astonished at what had happened\r\nand to be bewailing her fate, yet, looking back now over yesterday and\r\nthe day before, everything seemed part of a level and logical sequence,\r\nalmost like the events of a stormy day on board ship. The tragedy of the\r\ndestruction of the _Gaston_ only partly experienced could not be fully\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nStanding by the boat she tried to realize it and failed, tried to grasp\r\nwhat she knew to be the horror and pity of it, and failed. She was\r\nneither hard nor insensible, she simply could not grasp it.\r\n\r\nAnd her position here with two rough men, very little food and little\r\nchance of escape, how she would have pitied herself a few days ago could\r\nshe have foreseen! Yet here, with the firm sands under her feet and the\r\nwind blowing in her face, reality, instead of hurting her as it had done\r\nin the boat on awakening yesterday morning, soothed her and reassured\r\nher. Everything seemed firm again and the fear that the ugly coast had\r\nraised in her mind had vanished.\r\n\r\nShe came along the beach looking at the gulls, turned over huge\r\nstar-fish and picked up kelp ribbons to examine them. Half a mile or so\r\nfrom the cave she was about to turn back when her eye caught a strange\r\nappearance on the sea, hundreds and hundreds of moving points drawing in\r\nto the shore, white and black points like a shoal of fish only half\r\nsubmerged. It was a fleet of swimming birds.\r\n\r\nShe sat down on the sand to watch as they took the shore with a rush\r\nthrough the foam. Then, safely beached, the fleet became an army of\r\npenguins. She had seen pictures of penguins so she knew what they were\r\nand she had read Anatole France's \"Penquin Island\"--these, then, were\r\nthe real things and she watched them fascinated as one who sees\r\nstoryland taking visible and concrete form.\r\n\r\nThe penguins formed line, broke into companies, drilled a bit and then\r\nbegan to move up the beach.\r\n\r\nThe figure of the girl did not seem to disturb them in the least.\r\n\r\nOne company passed to the left, one to the right, whilst that\r\nimmediately fronting her halted a few feet away and saluted her, bowing\r\nlike little old-fashioned men in black swallow-tail coats and immaculate\r\nshirt fronts, little old-fashioned men with sharp quizzical eyes,\r\npolished, humorous, polite and entirely friendly.\r\n\r\nThe company on the right wheeled to examine her as did the company on\r\nthe left, so that she found herself almost in a hollow square. Wherever\r\nshe turned there were birds bowing to her or things in the semblance of\r\nbirds, absolutely fearless, so close that she could have touched them\r\nhad she carried a walking-stick.\r\n\r\nShe rose up to allow them to pass and they went on like mechanical\r\nthings wound up and released, forming line again and seeming to forget\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe remembered the guillemots and their rudeness and the way they had\r\nstormed and jeered at the boat--did all that mean more than the\r\npoliteness and friendliness of the penguins? If she were lying dead\r\nwould not the guillemots pass her without enmity and the penguins\r\nwithout friendliness, as indifferent to her fate as the wave of the sea\r\non the blowing wind?\r\n\r\nThey would--as indifferent as the great islands standing out there in\r\nthe distance, mauve and slate grey against the morning. As she came back\r\nalong the beach her mind was battling with a problem that had suddenly\r\nrisen. She had neither brush nor comb nor glass. Her hair was beautiful\r\nand she loved it. Her face was beautiful but she did not love it, it was\r\nherself, she could not view it from an independent standpoint, but she\r\ncould view her hair almost as impartially as a dress and she loved it\r\nwith the strange passion that women have for things of texture.\r\n\r\nThe hair of Cléo de Bromsart had been waited upon like a divinity by\r\nmany a priestess in the form of a maid. It had been dressed and\r\nshampooed and treated by artists and adepts, the hours of brushing alone\r\nif put together would have made a terrific total. The result was\r\nperfection, and even now, after all she had gone through, it shewed\r\nscarcely disarrangement, lustrous and beautiful, dressed with artful\r\nsimplicity in the Greek style and outlining the perfect curves of her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe wind was blowing now in gusto from the sea, but she scarcely noticed\r\nit as she walked, facing the problem that shipwreck had put before her,\r\na problem the first of a long queue ranging from soap to a change of\r\ngarments.\r\n\r\nShe was fighting it and at the same time battling with the strengthening\r\nwind when suddenly something sprang on her with the yell of a tiger and\r\nflung her on the sand, pinning her there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE WOOLEY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the wind. The Wooley, which is the fist of Kerguelen suddenly\r\nclenched and hitting out from the shoulder of the great islands now\r\nsuddenly stormed about with foam and veiled in spray.\r\n\r\nHalf stunned, she twisted round, still lying but fronting it now with\r\nher arm protecting her face. The beach had loudened up in thunder from\r\nend to end but the yelling Wooley as it met the cliffs and howled inland\r\nalmost drowned the thunder of the waves. Then it died down as suddenly\r\nas it had come, and the boom of the surf rose high, as the girl,\r\ngathering herself together, got up and struggled on.\r\n\r\nShe was no longer thinking of her hair. It was the first lesson of the\r\nschool of Kerguelen. \"Here you shall think of nothing but the moment, of\r\nthe ground beneath your feet, of the bite you put in your mouth, of the\r\nrock that stands before you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the cave with her petticoats thrusting about her she\r\nwas met by the two men and as she came up to them La Touche was cursing\r\nthe wind. The Wooley had all but blown him down too. He had got up\r\nsooner than Bompard and had received the full face of it \"in the pit of\r\nthe stomach.\" He seemed to look on it as a personal matter affecting him\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nEven as he spoke a sudden calm fell, lasted for a moment, and was\r\nfollowed by a howl from inland.\r\n\r\nAt a stroke the wind had changed right round and was blowing now from\r\nthe mountains. Here in the shelter of the cliffs they scarcely felt it\r\nbut the shift had raised an appalling cross sea. Right away to the\r\nislands there was nothing but tumbling foam, waves standing up and\r\nfighting waves in a battle that spread for leagues.\r\n\r\n\"It's well for us we didn't fall in with this yesterday,\" said Bompard\r\n\"a ship couldn't stand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what ship will ever poke her nose in here to take us off do you\r\nthink?\" asked La Touche. \"This is what you get every day of the week, if\r\nall accounts are true--this, and worse. I tell you we've come to the\r\nwrong place. There's no getting over it. We've come to the wrong place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, right or wrong, here we are,\" said Bompard \"Mon Dieu! to hear you\r\ntalk you'd think we'd come here on purpose--come, get a move on and\r\nlet's have some grub.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned into the cave and they fetched out the can of beef they had\r\nopened yesterday, some biscuits, and a water breaker, and sitting at the\r\ncave mouth they ate just as the men of the Stone Age ate, with the palms\r\nof their hands for plates and their fingers for forks. They spoke\r\nscarcely at all. The ill-humor of La Touche seemed like a contagious\r\ndisease, even Bompard, the imperturbable, seemed glum.\r\n\r\nIt was the girl who broke the strain.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she began to speak as if giving voice to carefully thought out\r\nideas. Yet what she said was absolutely spontaneous, the result of a\r\nquick, educated mind suddenly grasping the essentials of their position,\r\nsuggestion breeding suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"There's no use in grumbling,\" said she. \"That wind knocked me down as I\r\nwas coming along the beach. I didn't grumble, and there is no use in\r\nthinking. I was thinking as I walked along that I had no brush and comb\r\nto do my hair with, you two have short hair and you can't imagine what\r\nit is to a person with long hair when they find themselves without a\r\nbrush and comb. I was grumbling to myself about it when the wind knocked\r\nme down. I want just to tell you what is in my mind: we will die or go\r\nmad if we do not forget everything as much as we can and not think of\r\nto-morrow or yesterday or ships coming to take us off. We have to fight\r\nall sorts of things that don't care in the least for us and we have to\r\nwork. Everything here is at work in its own way. Well, we must do as\r\neverything else does or die.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's easy to say work,\" said La Touche munching a biscuit, \"but what is\r\none to work at?\"\r\n\r\n\"We want food for one thing, our provisions won't last forever.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's rabbits enough,\" said Bompard. \"Remember those rabbits we saw\r\nrunning out on the beach last evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can snare rabbits all right,\" said La Touche, \"but where's the wire\r\nto make snares with--see--we're caught everywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" said Bompard.\r\n\r\nHe got up and went down to the boat, hunted in one of the lockers and\r\nreturned with a spool of wire.\r\n\r\nHe flung it at La Touche.\r\n\r\n\"There's your wire,\" said he.\r\n\r\nCléo's eyes brightened. The spool of wire seemed to her a fruit suddenly\r\nborn from her words; she had accomplished something, it was perhaps the\r\nfirst real accomplishment in her life.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get it from?\" asked La Touche.\r\n\r\n\"The forward locker,\" replied Bompard.\r\n\r\n\"Are there any other things in the locker?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mon Dieu, yes,\" replied the old fellow. \"There's a lot of truck,\r\nbut it's no use to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's go and see,\" said Cléo. She rose up and came down the beach\r\nfollowed by the others. The wind from the mountains died away but the\r\nsea torment remained and, though the tide was beginning to ebb, the\r\nspray of the waves almost reached the boat.\r\n\r\nIt had been listed to one side by the Wooley but was undamaged and the\r\nforward locker was still open as it had been left by the careless\r\nBompard.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the boats used for fishing and deep sea work, hence the\r\ncontents of the locker.\r\n\r\nThe steel head of a two pronged fish spear, a fisherman's knife in its\r\nsheath with belt, a paternoster, invaluable for the fathoms of fishing\r\nline attached, a small American axe with the head vaselined, a canvas\r\nhousewife with sail-needles, a few darning needles and some pack thread,\r\nand a number of odds and ends including some extra heavy lead sinkers.\r\n\r\nBompard looked on apathetically and La Touche stood with his hands in\r\nhis pockets as the girl fished the things out one by one, placing them,\r\nsome on the sands and some on the thwarts of the boat.\r\n\r\nThe things seemed to have no interest for the men. Accustomed all their\r\nlives to being looked after as far as shelter and food were concerned\r\nthey seemed absolutely helpless in front of new conditions. Men are like\r\nthat, especially men of the people, and when you read of Crusoes and\r\ntheir wonderful doings on desert islands you read Romance.\r\n\r\nThe quick, trained mind of the girl seemed to see clearly where they\r\ncould scarcely see at all, she had imagination and she was a woman--that\r\nis to say a being more gifted than man, with prevision in affairs purely\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nBompard did not see any use in the axe and said so. The girl, with her\r\nhand resting on the gunnel of the boat, stood like a housekeeper trying\r\nto explain to a mere male creature the use of some household implement.\r\n\r\n\"We will want a fire and an axe will chop wood,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and where are you to get the wood?\" asked La Touche. \"There's not a\r\ntree on this blasted place, nor the sign of one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll have to look--there may be trees inland--there's sure to be\r\nbushes of some sort--anyhow we will take these things up to the cave,\r\nthey will be safer there.\"\r\n\r\nThe baling tin of the boat caught her eye, she included it amongst her\r\nprizes.\r\n\r\nThis baling tin, like a psychological instrument, exhibited the mind of\r\nBompard as though that said mind had been scooped out and placed in it.\r\n\r\nTo him it was a baling tin; here there were no boats to be baled\r\nout--where was the use of it?\r\n\r\nTo the woman it was a possible pot to boil things in if they could get a\r\nfire and things to boil.\r\n\r\nShe explained and Bompard saw the light. La Touche saw it, too, but\r\npromptly pointed out that they had no fire and nothing to boil. He\r\nseemed to find an odious satisfaction in the fact, a satisfaction which\r\nBompard faintly reflected, and for a moment the girl seemed to glimpse\r\nin the two men a lethargy of mind almost unthinkable. A lethargy and\r\nlaziness, mulish, and kicking at anything that disturbed it, that\r\nactually fought against betterment because betterment meant exercise of\r\nintellect and action.\r\n\r\nShe felt angry with them, just as a grown person feels angry with lazy\r\nchildren, and putting the belt with the knife round her waist and\r\npicking up some of her treasures she ordered the others to follow with\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nWhen they had been placed in the cave with the provisions, Bompard,\r\nafter his great labours, cut himself some tobacco and La Touche lit his\r\npipe. Then they sat down at their cave opening to smoke and rest\r\nthemselves whilst the girl, who could not keep still, went back to the\r\nboat to explore the other lockers and see if by chance anything else of\r\na useful nature might be found. The two men seated smoking at the cave\r\nmouth watched her as she went. She felt their eyes upon her and guessed\r\nthat they were discussing her, but she did not mind.\r\n\r\nThe ceaseless activity of old Madame de Warens seemed to have descended\r\non her through the air of Kerguelen. The will that Prince Selm had\r\ndivined in her had been aroused; the surroundings seemed to call her to\r\naction from every side; the past and the future seemed phantoms before\r\nthe tremendous and insistent present. Fate could perhaps have broken her\r\nspirit only in one way, by casting her upon the sordid. If she had been\r\nsocially shipwrecked and thrown onto a Paris slum she might have gone\r\nunder. Here where everything was clean, where the air was life, where\r\nnothing was sordid, she swam; here she was miraculously filled with a\r\nnew energy and an extraordinary new interest as though she were peeping\r\nat things for the very first time.\r\n\r\nThe forward locker was now empty, she hunted in the others and\r\ndiscovered two more Maconochie tins that Bompard had overlooked, some\r\ncotton waste, a roll of thick copper wire and a bradawl.\r\n\r\nShe collected the lot and brought them up to the cave before which her\r\ncompanions were seated.\r\n\r\nShe handed them to La Touche, who, without getting up, leaned back and\r\npushed them as far into the cave as he could reach, then he resumed his\r\npipe whilst Cléo standing and shading her eyes looked away up and down\r\nthe beach as though measuring its possibilities.\r\n\r\n\"I found a lot of things down there this morning before the tide was\r\nhigh,\" said she. \"There were star-fish, big ones like what I have seen\r\non the beach at Bordighera; the Italian people eat them. I'm sure there\r\nmust be lots of food to be found here on the beach. Then there is a big\r\nbreak in the cliffs lower down that seems to lead inland. I think the\r\nbest thing we can do is to start now and hunt about and see what we can\r\nfind. You two can go inland, and I will go along the beach. It's\r\nabsolutely necessary to find any sort of food, and wood to make a fire.\"\r\n\r\nThe smokers were disposed to argue.\r\n\r\nYes, it was quite true, one must look round, but there was grub enough\r\nfor a month and there was plenty of time before them. Then La Touche\r\nbegan to argue about star-fish. He had never heard of people eating\r\nstar-fish. If they were to be condemned to eat stuff like that it would\r\nbe better to quit. One might have fancied from his tone that it was\r\nCléo's fault that such a suggestion should be made.\r\n\r\nCléo listened patiently and Bompard sat evidently approving. It was\r\nalmost as though the two were in league against her, just as children\r\nget in league against an adult who insists on unpleasant duties or\r\nuncongenial food.\r\n\r\nBut a will was at work stronger than theirs and presently, tapping out\r\ntheir pipes, they rose up. La Touche, at her direction, placed the new\r\nfound Maconochie tins, the cotton waste, the bradawl and wire with the\r\nrest of the stores, far back in the cave, and then, following her, they\r\nlumbered along down the beach in the direction of the cliff break like\r\ntwo schoolboys after a governess.\r\n\r\nThe cliff break was a narrow gully piercing the basalt and bending upon\r\nitself; here they parted, the men striking up the gulley and the girl\r\ncontinuing her way along the beach.\r\n\r\n\"And be sure to look out for some wood,\" she cried after them, \"any sort\r\nof wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Bompard, \"we'll be on the look out right enough.\"\r\n\r\nThen they vanished and she pursued her way alone, picking up things as\r\nshe went, turning over shells and thinking of her companions.\r\n\r\nThe wind had fanned up again to a strong breeze but the sound of the\r\nsurf had fallen with the receding tide and the stretch of wet sand\r\nbelow high tide mark was strewn with huge kelp ribbons, masses of\r\nseaweed, shells, all empty, cuttle fish bones and the star-fish\r\ndespised of La Touche.\r\n\r\nThen she came upon something that gave her a grue, it seemed at first\r\nlike a white rock, it was a skull. The skull of some enormous creature\r\nhalf-bedded in the sand just above the tide mark, possibly cast up in\r\nsome storm. She thought it might be the skull of a whale and as she\r\nstood looking at it, suddenly, the desolation around came in upon her\r\nwith the fact that she was absolutely alone.\r\n\r\nSuppose the men lost their way--suppose that they never came back? The\r\nthought clutched her heart like a hand. To be here, alone, absolutely\r\nalone, forever!\r\n\r\nFor a moment panic seized her and the wild impulse came upon her to turn\r\nand run back to the cave. Then she mastered herself, fighting down the\r\nsurging in her throat, and continuing her way steadily and with renewed\r\nstrength. She had not cast the thought away, she had mastered it and as\r\nshe went she contemplated it as a victor contemplates the dead body of\r\nan assailant.\r\n\r\nThen she saw the penguins, she had not noticed them before, they were\r\ndrawn up in long lines at the base of the cliff and the sight of them\r\ndestroyed the desolation just as the skull had crystallized it around\r\nher.\r\n\r\nA great pow-wow was going on amongst the penguins. Three birds,\r\nseparate from the others, were standing, two facing one another bowing\r\nand discussing something, the third standing by, putting in a word now\r\nand then and now and then coming right between the disputants.\r\n\r\nShe watched them for awhile and then went on. She had no time to waste.\r\nThe thought of coming back empty handed after all her talk to the men\r\npursued her. She was looking for food and had found none--nothing but\r\nthe star-fish.\r\n\r\nThe gulls evidently found plenty of food. But for a human being there\r\nseemed nothing, and as she went on and on the thought of what would\r\nhappen when those tins in the cave were empty came at her just as the\r\nterror of finding herself alone had come, and this thought was not to be\r\ncombated by an effort of will simply because it was born of Reason.\r\n\r\nHer clear and practical mind saw starvation, over-leaped the slender\r\nfood barrier that held hunger only a month away from them and wandered\r\nin a wilderness where nothing was.\r\n\r\nShe had reached the rock surface now that stretched away level and\r\nsmooth, broken by cracks and pot holes and strewn here and there with\r\nweed. The cliffs had fallen away, giving a view of the broken country\r\nand the mountains with their snow-covered tops, immense, wrapped in\r\ndistance under the dull grey day, remote, yet clearly defined in that\r\nair, crystal clear as the air of Iceland.\r\n\r\nIt was like looking at Silence herself, silence set off and explained\r\nby the beach noises, the sound of the surf, the calling of the terns,\r\nthe mewing of the great white gulls.\r\n\r\nShe saw Kerguelen as it is, as it was, as it ever will be. Standing\r\nthere alone she saw it for the first time in all its utter nakedness. If\r\nno food were to be found on the busy beach, what food could be found in\r\nthat carved, silent, cruel land where not a single tree shewed in all\r\nthe miles of desolation?\r\n\r\nA stealthy scraping sound behind her made her wheel round.\r\n\r\nUp from a rock pond which she had passed without examining had risen a\r\ncrab, its body was not bigger than the two fists of a man put together,\r\nyet it moved standing high up like a spider on slender stilts that if\r\nstretched out would have measured four feet or more. She watched it with\r\ndilated eyes as it scrambled and hurried along, vanishing at last like a\r\nspectre in some cleft of the rock. There was something of a skeleton\r\nabout it as well as something of a spider, it was like a caricature of\r\nfood drawn by Famine. It made the whole beach hideous for a moment and\r\nit made the food hunter almost afraid to go on. She crushed the fear and\r\nwent on, reaching a place where the rocks ceased and a broad level of\r\nsand stretched to where the rocks began again and further on the river\r\nran down.\r\n\r\nWhere the sand met the further rocks a huge conical stone stood with a\r\ngull roosting on its top, and just as a person fixes on some object as\r\nthe limit of his walk she determined to go as far as this stone and then\r\nturn back.\r\n\r\nAs she drew close to it the gull flapped its wings and flew away and she\r\nsaw that the thing was not a stone but the figure-head of a ship, the\r\nform of a woman with ample breasts, broken and scarred by years of\r\nweather and stained with the droppings of gulls. The arms were gone, but\r\nthe great face remained almost in its entirety staring away across the\r\nsands and the sea.\r\n\r\nIt had once worn a crown, but the crown was broken away all but a little\r\nbit on the left side of the head and it had an appearance of life that\r\nalmost daunted the girl as she stood looking, watching it, and listening\r\nto the singing sound of the beach echoes and the mewing and crying of\r\nthe gulls.\r\n\r\nThen as she moved closer her foot struck on something half buried in the\r\nsand, it was a balk of timber, ships timber was all about, sanded over,\r\nand in places half uncovered. Here was firewood enough for twenty years.\r\nIn the figure-head alone there was enough to supply their wants for a\r\nlong time to come.\r\n\r\nShe sat down to rest on a projecting piece of this timber near the\r\nfigure. Close up to it like this it lost its touch of life and became\r\nsimply a block of wood, and from this point she could see the beach over\r\nwhich she had travelled stretching away and away to the Lizard Point\r\nwith the foam breaking around it and flown about by the never-resting\r\ngulls.\r\n\r\nShe had come nearly three miles and she had found something worth\r\nfinding by just keeping on.\r\n\r\nShe remembered the spectre crab. It had nearly turned her back\r\nempty-handed, but she had kept on and she registered that fact deeply in\r\nher mind, dwelling on it with a pleasure she had never felt before.\r\n\r\nThen she fell to thinking of the ship that all this belonged to and the\r\nstorm that must have driven it here. The weeds of the high tide mark did\r\nnot come within ten feet of the wreckage, so the waves must have come a\r\nhundred feet or more beyond where she was sitting. Perhaps it was at\r\nnight with all this coast roaring in the darkness and the wind yelling\r\nabove the shouting of the waves. And all that must have happened years\r\nago, to judge by the work of the weather on the once gaily painted woman\r\nand the depth the timbers had sunk in the sand.\r\n\r\nShe rose up, and before starting back she glanced inland towards the\r\nmountains across the broken country.\r\n\r\nThen she shaded her eyes.\r\n\r\nBeyond the fringe of the beach and amongst the high broken rocks stood a\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE CROSS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thing itself startled her less than the fact that she had not seen\r\nit before. It was as though it had been put up whilst she sat to rest.\r\n\r\nIt was so striking, so palpably evident that anyone coming along towards\r\nthe figure-head as she had done must have been attracted by it. To\r\nverify this she walked a few yards away and even as she did so the cross\r\nvanished, shut out from sight by the rock to the left of it. Only from\r\nthe point of view of the figure-head could it be seen.\r\n\r\nIt was as though the beach had tried to frighten her again.\r\n\r\nShe came towards it, noticing as she came the shortness of the arms. It\r\nwas less a cross than a sign-post, a sign-post raised on a mound of\r\nsmall rocks; it was tarred to preserve it from the weather. From the\r\nleft limb close to the post a metal box was hanging by a wire, and on\r\nthe post itself, a few feet from the base, there was a plate of\r\ngalvanised iron nailed to the wood. On the plate were stamped some\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nShe stepped upon the mound and read: \"Kestrel Expedition. Cache I. Don't\r\ndisturb 19--\"\r\n\r\nThe date was three years back.\r\n\r\nThe cache, whatever it might be, was under the mound. Also, this thing\r\nhad evidently nothing to do with the wreck, for the embossed metal plate\r\nmust have been prepared in some civilized country for the purpose to\r\nwhich it had been put.\r\n\r\nShe reached up and tried to detach the box and pulling on it brought\r\ndown the slat of wood that formed the arms of the cross, the nails that\r\nhad held it having rusted away.\r\n\r\nThen, having detached the box, she examined it. It was an ordinary\r\nsailor's tobacco box, she pressed the spring, opened it, and found a\r\npiece of paper folded in four and inscribed as follows, the writing done\r\nwith a purple indelible pencil:\r\n\r\n          Opened the cach.\r\n          Took nuthing out.\r\n          Stuck in som extry goods\r\n          Put the ship about.\r\n    To any one that finds it in this blasted hole\r\n            Sam Slacum,\r\n               Master Mariner. Thresler 19--\r\n\r\nThen as an after thought:\r\n\r\n          \"Keep up your spirits.\"\r\n\r\nThe date was a year after the date on the post. The cache had not been\r\nvisited evidently since then. For three years it had lain here, and for\r\nthree years, evidently, only one ship had put in. This dismal thought\r\ntook all the pleasure away from the find, she sat down on the rocks\r\nforming the mound and holding the paper in her fingers gave way for a\r\nmoment to a depression that came against her like a black, surging sea.\r\nThen she remembered that the cross had been only visible from one point,\r\nthat vessels might have been here and not have seen it, that men might\r\neven have landed and found it without leaving the fact behind them,\r\nafter the manner of the writer of this paper.\r\n\r\nAnd then, suddenly, and as if from the sky came the thought of\r\nProvidence, the feeling that she had been led along the beach to find\r\nthe wood and to find this. The remembrance of how she had been saved\r\nfrom the _Gaston de Paris_ rose up in her mind also--saved almost by a\r\nmiracle.\r\n\r\nTo a person torn from civilization and flung into the arms of Nature the\r\nmost terrible thing is the sense of the amorphous, the feeling that\r\nthere is no structure in this world where houses are not and laws are\r\nnot and streets are not, no power to intervene between oneself and\r\ninjury, no thread to cling to. The idea of a Providence to such a person\r\nis like brandy.\r\n\r\nThe girl remembered the words she had spoken that morning to her\r\ncompanions when she said that one must not think here but work. There\r\nwas no use in thinking of the past or the future, of ships coming or\r\nnot, they had been taken care of so far and the feeling came to her that\r\nthis would be so to the end.\r\n\r\nShe rose up, put the paper back in the box and the box in her pocket,\r\nthen she turned to the cache.\r\n\r\nShe walked round the mound to a spot where the covering rocks had fallen\r\naway a bit and going down on her knees began pulling them apart and\r\ncarrying them off one by one, dumping them a few yards away. Her rings\r\nhindered her and taking them off she put them in the tobacco box and the\r\nbox in her pocket. Under the rocks lay a covering of sand, she fetched\r\nthe arm of the cross and scraping away at the sand came upon something\r\nhard, it was the end of a barrel. Then she stood up, flushed with her\r\nwork and satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe stores were there, whatever they might be, and with the help of the\r\ntwo men they would easily be uncovered. The question whether they would\r\nbe of any use after all the years they had lain there recurred to her,\r\nbut she put it aside. They would soon see.\r\n\r\nThen she started back for the caves taking the slat of wood with her as\r\na trophy. As she went the recollection of the find followed her\r\nagreeably, she did not know which to congratulate herself most upon, the\r\nwood of the wreck or the cache. Then came the dismal thought of winter,\r\nbegotten of the idea of fires. It was the middle of August. Winter lay\r\nahead. If no ship came to take them off what would their life be like\r\nduring the winter months? Imagine this place at Christmas, covered\r\nperhaps with snow! The gloom of this idea pursued her for a mile or more\r\ntill all of a sudden she stopped and laughed aloud at her own\r\nstupidity. It was not autumn, it was spring. They were south of the line\r\nand summer lay before them, not winter. That gloomy ghost, fear of the\r\nFuture, which spoils so many men's lives in Civilization, had tricked\r\nher and made her miserable and as she cast it from her and pursued her\r\nway she said to herself again: \"I will not think, here the person who\r\nthinks and broods is lost.\"\r\n\r\nWhen she reached the caves the men had not yet returned; leaving the\r\nslat of wood leaning against the cliff she came down to the boat and\r\nstood for a moment looking at the sea. The tide was far out now and\r\ncoming in again, the sea had fallen to a gentle glassy swell and the\r\ntreacherous wind had died away to a faint breeze. Out there where the\r\nwaves were coming in and at the limit of the sands rocks were uncovered,\r\nshaggy, black rocks that seemed covered with fur. She came down to them\r\nand found that the fur was a coating of mussels. Here was another find.\r\nShe began to pick them and then, running back to the cave for the baling\r\ntin, filled it to the brim, and placed it in the boat. Having done this\r\nshe sat down with her back to the boat to rest and wait for the men.\r\n\r\nThey ought to have returned by this. The thought that some disaster had\r\nhappened to them came to her and tried to creep into her mind, but she\r\ndrove it out promptly, stamped on it and began to think of how they\r\nwould cook the mussles. They would make a fire with the slat she had\r\nbrought back, it was tarred and would burn finely, with that and some\r\nof the bottom boards of the boat, unless Bompard could be persuaded to\r\ngo and cut some wood from the wreckage three miles away. Then she\r\nthought how fortunate it was that men smoked. La Touche had a Swedish\r\nmatch box nearly full of matches and Bompard had a tinder box, one of\r\nthe sort that makes a spark by the striking of a wheel against a flint.\r\n\r\nThen she yawned.\r\n\r\nShe had been in the open air since early dawn and it was now noon. She\r\nwas not tired, but she was filled with a craving for something, yet she\r\ncould not tell what this something was that she wanted and without which\r\nshe felt somehow lost. Then she knew--it was a roof.\r\n\r\nA person accustomed to live under a roof and suddenly condemned to live\r\nin the open suffers nothing for the first few hours. Then there\r\ngradually comes upon him a weariness and distress almost unimaginable to\r\nthose who have not experienced it. He craves not only for a roof but for\r\nwalls around him to protect him from the great open spaces that seem\r\nsucking away his individuality. A man living absolutely in the open\r\nwithout tent or cave or house wherein to concentrate himself would\r\nsurely and without doubt either become mad or descend to the level of\r\nthe beasts.\r\n\r\nShe came up the beach to the cave where she had slept, went into it, and\r\nsat down, her mind finding instant relief from the craving that had\r\nfilled it. Her hands went up to her hair and began to arrange it as best\r\nthey could. Had she been alone on the beach she would have taken the\r\npins out and left it loose for the winds to comb and blow about, but the\r\nthought of the men prevented her. She did not like the idea of their\r\nseeing her going about with her hair down; after her experiences in the\r\nboat it seemed absurd to quibble over a thing like this and she tried to\r\nargue with herself without avail. It seemed to her that if she went\r\nabout in _negligé_ like that she would lower herself. How? There was\r\nnothing unwomanly in flowing hair, there was nothing indelicate. No, but\r\nwomen of her class never appeared before men in that fashion, she would\r\nlower herself socially.\r\n\r\nA fool would have laughed at her, holding that amidst castaways there\r\nwas no such thing as social position, and, though fools are not\r\ninevitably wrong in their opinions, he would have been wrong.\r\n\r\nThough Bompard and La Touche had dropped the \"mademoiselle\" in\r\naddressing her, they treated her since landing with a certain respect\r\nwhich would have been wanting had she been a woman of their own class.\r\n\r\nThe class difference held and was a greater protection to her than\r\nanything else. In their eyes she was not a woman, but a lady, a fact\r\nthat chilled familiarity, or worse, and, with the aid of her superior\r\nintelligence, gave her authority.\r\n\r\nShe felt this instinctively and determined that at no time and in no\r\nmanner would she allow her position to degrade.\r\n\r\nThen, having done what she could to her hair she took the rings from the\r\ntobacco box and put them on. She would have much preferred not to have\r\nworn them, they irritated her, but they were part of her insignia and\r\nshe put them on.\r\n\r\nAs she was putting the tobacco box back in her pocket something looked\r\nin at her. It was a rabbit, a grey fat rabbit that had lopped right to\r\nthe cave mouth; it sat up for a moment on its hind legs, looked in, and\r\nthen lopped off without any hurry, as though a girl seated in a cave\r\nwere an accustomed object and a human being something not to be afraid\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThis fearlessness of the rabbit would have started her on a long and\r\ndismal train of thought had she not checked herself in time and like the\r\nman in the haunted house who kept the fear of ghosts away by thinking of\r\nplum puddings, she started to work, re-folding the sail that had served\r\nher for a pillow the night before; then she took the oilskin coat out\r\nand shook it, and folding it, placed it by the left wall of the cave\r\nwith the sou'wester on top of it. She was tidying her house.\r\n\r\nThen she went into the men's cave and did a bit of tidying there,\r\nstacking the tins more neatly and putting the odds and ends together.\r\nThe sight of the cotton waste gave her an idea and going down to the\r\nboat she emptied the mussels from the baling tin on to the sand, filled\r\nthe tin with sea water and bathed her face and hands, drying them on\r\nthe cotton. She had finished this operation and had got the mussels back\r\nin the tin when a shout caused her to turn.\r\n\r\nIt was the men, they were coming along the beach from the break in the\r\ncliffs. Bompard leading, La Touche lagging behind.\r\n\r\nBompard was carrying something under his arm, it was a Kerguelen\r\ncabbage. La Touche carried nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CACHE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen she lay down that night on the hard sand, with the sailcloth\r\nbeneath her head, she could not sleep. The wretchedness of having to lie\r\ndown fully dressed, of being unable to change her clothes, fell on her\r\nlike a blight.\r\n\r\nShe lay fighting the problem. It was impossible to go on like this. One\r\nmight live with little food, but to live always without undressing and\r\nchanging one's things was impossible. This problem was insoluble, or\r\nseemed so. Then she found a half solution. She would discard her\r\nstockings and under garments, make a bundle of them and put them under\r\nthe sailcloth, she would not wear them again, she would suffer from\r\ncold, no matter, anything was better than that feeling of being fully\r\ndressed always. The weather, besides, was fairly warm. She would learn\r\nto do without shoes as well as without stockings. She would have to go\r\nabout without shoes or stockings. She thought of the men. Strangely\r\nenough the thought of going about without shoes or stockings seemed less\r\nrepulsive to her than the thought of going about with her hair loose.\r\n\r\nAs she lay revolving this business in her mind the whale birds flitting\r\nabout in the darkness outside suddenly ceased their crying and through\r\nthe silence came a vague mysterious sound that deepened into a humming\r\nlike the drone of a gigantic top; the humming became a roar, the roar of\r\nrain. Rain falling in solid sheets, coming across the land like a moving\r\nNiagara, now taking the beach and now the sea. Never had she heard such\r\nrain as this, falling in the black and utter darkness. The shelve of the\r\nbeach saved the cave from being flooded and the beetling of the cliff\r\nkept it dry and within a couple of feet of the entrance but it could not\r\nkeep out the rain smell, the raw smell of Kerguelen carried from inland,\r\nthe smell of bog patches and new washed dolerite and bitter vegetation,\r\nkeen, like the smell of the Stone Age. Then after a bit the first great\r\nonslaught slackened.\r\n\r\nThe girl raised herself on her elbow, then she rose and cast off the\r\noilskin coat that had served for a blanket. She undressed in the\r\ndarkness, made a bundle of her stockings and her Jaeger underclothes and\r\nplaced them beneath the sailcloth, then removing the comb from her hair\r\nand letting it fall she came out into the blackness and stood in the\r\ntorrential rain.\r\n\r\nIt beat on her head and shoulders and breast, it cascaded down her\r\nlimbs, soothing as the hand of mesmerism, refreshing, delightful beyond\r\nwords, then she came back into the cave and, finding the cotton waste,\r\ndried herself as well as she could, dried her hair and twisted it into\r\na knot, put on her blouse, coat and skirt and covered herself with the\r\noilskin.\r\n\r\nShe had solved the question of a bath and change of clothes, at least\r\nfor the moment. The discomfort of the rough tweed of the skirt against\r\nher unprotected limbs, of the hard bed, of the sailcloth pillow with\r\nits vague smell of canvas and jute, all these were nothing to that other\r\ndiscomfort. These were physical, that was psychical.\r\n\r\nShe fell asleep and slept till long after dawn. When she came out the\r\nrain had ceased and through air fresh as though from the hand of\r\nCreation vast clouds were rolling away towards the islands over a\r\nblue-green sea.\r\n\r\nThey had made a fire on the night before and had cooked some of the\r\nmussels in the baling tin, the rest had been put by to cook for\r\nbreakfast; hot food of any sort is a revelation if you have been\r\ncondemned to live on cold stuff for any time, but this morning there was\r\nto be nothing hot. The firewood, one of the bottom boards of the boat\r\nchopped up, had been left out in the rain. The sight of it, all soaked,\r\nmade the girl forget her bare feet and her hair roughly tied up in a\r\nknot. The housekeeper that lives in every woman rose up in revolt, all\r\nthe more so as the guilty ones tried to defend themselves.\r\n\r\n\"As for me,\" said La Touche, \"I was listening to the rain, it drove\r\neverything else out of my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is so,\" said Bompard, \"I thought every moment we would be flooded\r\nout. It was no time for a man to be thinking of firewood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you will have no fire and nothing hot,\" said Cléo, \"and those\r\nmussels will be wasted--they won't keep, but there's no use in saying\r\nany more about it--only you must learn to think of things. It's not\r\npleasant, I know, to have to look ahead but one has to do it. You see I\r\nam not wearing my boots and stockings, boots wear out and stockings wear\r\nout quicker, so I just looked ahead last night and said to myself--'your\r\nstockings will soon be worn into holes, so you must begin now to learn\r\nto do without them.' It's not pleasant, but it has to be done. If that\r\nship we ran into had looked ahead we would not have been wrecked.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" said Bompard, anxious to get off the main subject. \"If\r\nthose chaps had eyes in their heads they wouldn't be feeding the\r\nfishes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't all their fault,\" put in La Touche. \"If those chaps on the\r\nbridge hadn't put the engines on we wouldn't have rammed her as we did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Cléo, \"there is no use in going back over things. We have\r\nto get breakfast and then go and open the cache.\"\r\n\r\nShe had told them of the cache overnight and, to her wonder, the thing\r\nhad interested them, so this morning when they had finished their\r\nbiscuits and beef she found not the slightest difficulty in making them\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nShe put on her boots for the journey and then they reeled along the\r\nbeach in the usual order, Cléo first, the two others following; the\r\ngreat skull made them halt and discuss it for a moment but the\r\nfigure-head when they reached it held them entirely in its spell.\r\n\r\nShe could scarcely tear them away, they discussed it from every point of\r\nview, argued over it, pondered over it and were only brought to their\r\nsenses by a hint that it would have to be chopped up for firewood.\r\n\r\nThen, when they reached the cache, there was another long pause for\r\ndiscussion, the two sitting down to smoke whilst they talked it over.\r\n\r\nIt was not till she set to work pulling more stones away that they began\r\nto get busy; then when once started they laboured like negroes. The\r\nglimpse of the barrel end seemed to inflame them, but indeed they did\r\nnot want even that, for the business they had set their hands to had all\r\nthe fascination of treasure hunting mixed with the thrills of\r\nhouse-breaking. Here was \"stuff,\" plunder of some sort, who could tell\r\nwhat?\r\n\r\nAn hour and a half of labour brought them sweating to the end of the\r\nbusiness and the presiding gulls saw exposed to the light of day two big\r\nbarrels, two long cases and an amount of canned meat and vegetables\r\nenough to stock a small shop, also a harpoon of the old type and two\r\nshovels placed by the long cases. Then after a rest of half an hour the\r\nbarrels were sampled. One contained flour, the other blankets and mens'\r\nclothes, sweaters and coats and trousers. One of the long cases\r\ncontained kitchen utensils and tin cups and plates, also knives and\r\nforks and spoons.\r\n\r\nThe other contained \"comforts,\" tea and coffee and sugar in sealed tins,\r\nsome rolls of tobacco, drugs and a few surgical instruments. All the\r\nequipment, in fact, necessary for an expedition of a dozen men for six\r\nmonths. Not a drop of liquor.\r\n\r\nPerhaps that was why the girl was more overjoyed by the details of the\r\nfind than the mariners.\r\n\r\nBompard openly expressed his mind.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bottle of wine or a drop of rum, swabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you've got some tobacco,\" said Cléo, \"and there's tea and coffee\r\nand cups and saucers, and a teapot--no coffeepot--well one can make\r\ncoffee in anything--\" She was running over the stores in her mind,\r\nstanding, reviewing them with no thought of anything else and her soul\r\nfilled with a joy and satisfaction absolutely new.\r\n\r\nBlankets! Tea! Coffee! and clothes--even mens' clothes if it came to the\r\nworst. One might have fancied her to have fixed definitely in her mind\r\nthat she was to spend a very long time on the shores of Kerguelen and to\r\nhave accepted the terrible prospect with equanimity. It was not so. She\r\nwas living in the moment, so entirely in the moment that these things\r\nwere tremendous and vivid and compared with them Art, Music, Religion,\r\nAmbition, and the gauds of Civilization were as nothing.\r\n\r\nThis power to live in the moment is the form of strength that brings\r\nmen through battles and women through adversity. It fells cities and\r\nbuilds them. On Kerguelen it is salvation. For, here to think of the\r\nfuture, unless in terms of material necessities, to dream, to brood,\r\nmeans death or madness.\r\n\r\nBut Bompard and La Touche, resting themselves after their labours, were\r\nnot living in the moment nor in the past nor in the present, they were\r\nliving in that strange sad land called the Might-Have-Been. They might\r\nhave been in the way to a jolly booze by now if that fool who\r\nprovisioned the cache had not forgotten the drink. They were thankful\r\nfor nothing. They had food, they had clothes, they had tobacco. They\r\nwere glad enough of the blankets, but even the thought of the blankets\r\ncould not relieve their depression.\r\n\r\nThey were not drunkards, but the cache had given them hopes of drinks.\r\nThese hopes shattered they sat like discontented children who had been\r\npromised sweets and disappointed.\r\n\r\nBut this did not last long, the Hopeless is its own antidote and after\r\nhalf a pipe of tobacco their cheerfulness, such as it was, returned and\r\nthey fell to discussing with the girl the best way of treating the\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nBompard, considering the difficulty of transporting the stuff to the\r\ncaves, proposed that they should move their abode right up to the cache.\r\n\r\nCléo pointed out that there were no caves here, so, unless they moved\r\nthe caves as well as their belongings, they would have nowhere to sleep\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"I think the best thing we can do,\" said she, \"is to take what we want\r\nand then cover up the rest till we want some more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put the stuff under the rocks again?\" asked Bompard.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu!\" said La Touche.\r\n\r\nIt was not what he said but the way he said it that angered the girl.\r\n\r\nLa Touche was a problem in her mind. She could understand Bompard but\r\nshe could not quite understand La Touche. It seemed to her that he was\r\none of those people who without much intelligence, yet, or perhaps\r\nbecause of that fact, make fine centres of rebellion. She could fancy\r\nhim leading a mob to tear down something that vexed him, and everything\r\nseemed to vex him, at times.\r\n\r\nBut though she was not clear about La Touche she was quite clear about\r\nherself and she was determined to be his master. She felt instinctively\r\nthat he was the leader of Bompard and that Bompard alone would have been\r\na much better individual, in many respects.\r\n\r\n\"There is no use in saying 'Mon Dieu,'\" said she, \"the thing has to be\r\ndone. The gulls and the rabbits will ruin everything if we leave things\r\nabout. Come, Bompard.\"\r\n\r\nBompard rose up at the order and began to assist in sorting out the\r\nthings they were to take back with them. Then La Touche, not to be out\r\nof the business and perhaps ashamed of himself, or of his position as an\r\nidler, joined in.\r\n\r\nHad she given the order direct to him he might have revolted; she had\r\nconquered him for the moment none the less.\r\n\r\nFirst they began to sort out the things to be kept for immediate use. A\r\nsaucepan, three tin cups, three tin plates, knives and forks, the teapot\r\nand kettle, a canister of tea, sugar and salt. The canned stuff,\r\nincluding thirty cans of vegetables, Cléo left untouched. She determined\r\nto keep it in reserve and depend upon the cabbage plants, one of which\r\nBompard had brought back yesterday.\r\n\r\nThen came the question of the flour, that too must be kept in reserve\r\nand the opening they had made in the top of the barrel closed up\r\nproperly. This operation took time and was conducted with a good deal of\r\ngrumbling which fell on deaf ears. The thing was done and that was the\r\nmain thing. Four blankets were taken from the other barrel and that too\r\nwas closed. Then with the shovels the whole lot was sanded over and the\r\nrocks replaced, the girl helping in the work as well as directing.\r\n\r\nWhen everything was finished they made three bundles, using the blankets\r\nas holdalls, and started back.\r\n\r\nIt was now noon and the breeze that had been blowing ever since dawn had\r\ndied away, but great clouds were banking up over the islands, vast,\r\nsolemn, leaden-coloured clouds rolling up from the far sea and piling\r\none on the other like alps on alps.\r\n\r\nThey had nearly reached the caves when a roll of thunder like the ruffle\r\nof muffled drums came over the water, but they got under shelter before\r\nthe rain began to fall, just a few heavy drops, at first, and then in a\r\nmoment a cataract.\r\n\r\nThe islands vanished, the sea vanished to within a few hundred yards of\r\nthe beach, the voices of the gulls and the breaking of the waves became\r\nmerged and vague in the hiss of the sheeting rain.\r\n\r\n\"The chaps that left the truck in that cask forgot to shove in some\r\noilskins,\" said La Touche as he undid his load.\r\n\r\nCléo had come into the men's cave to help to unpack. Half-way back she\r\nhad taken her boots off. Owing to the absence of stockings her right\r\nheel had become chafed and she had taken them off determining not to\r\nwear them any more. She was kneeling now, bare-footed, taking the things\r\nfrom Bompard's bundle and La Touche's remark made her look up. It was\r\nthe tone rather than the words that irritated her. The recollection of\r\nan oilskin coat which she had used when fishing in Norway the year\r\nbefore rose in her mind. It had been put away for a long time and when\r\ntaken out had been found all stuck up and quite ruined.\r\n\r\n\"You can't be much of a sailor,\" said she, \"not to know that oilskin\r\ndoesn't stand packing. The men who buried these things did. If they had\r\nknown that you were so particular about rain they might have put in an\r\numbrella.\"\r\n\r\nDead silence followed this thrust of the tongue which she instantly\r\nregretted, not because of hurting La Touche's feelings, but because she\r\ninstantly felt that it had helped to widen the division between her and\r\nher mates. The extraordinary fact was that she, having assumed the\r\nresponsibility of office, was, seemingly, held responsible by the others\r\nfor all unpleasant happenings; she felt that the rain of Kerguelen was\r\nnow, in a way, being laid at her door.\r\n\r\nThen, again, she had singled out La Touche as a direct opponent. She\r\nfelt that he and she were already matching each other and there was\r\nlikely to be a struggle between them for dominance.\r\n\r\nWomen have been gifted above men with an instinctive knowledge of\r\ncharacter. She divined in La Touche a character weak yet capable of\r\nviolence, incapable of leading yet jealous of being led, and especially\r\nof being led by a woman. That was the danger point.\r\n\r\nHowever, there was no use in trying to say anything smooth and she went\r\non with her work, helping to stow the things and, when that was\r\nfinished, taking off two of the blankets to her own cave.\r\n\r\nA fire was impossible owing to the rain so they dined off biscuits and\r\ncanned stuff, cold.\r\n\r\nBompard and La Touche on this little expedition had discovered a water\r\nsource only a quarter of a mile inland, a deep pond cut in the rocks\r\nand fed by the rains. Bompard referred to it as he ate.\r\n\r\n\"But as long as the boat holds together,\" said he, \"we don't want to\r\nbother about water; she'll catch and hold all we want. I've heard tell\r\nit rains here months on end.\"\r\n\r\n\"When it's not blowing,\" said La Touche. Cléo said nothing. It came to\r\nher almost as a new impression that conversation as we know it was\r\nalmost impossible with her companions. They had no outlook over anything\r\nbut the material and they seemed to see nothing but the black side of\r\nthings. She felt also that any attempt to rally them and cheer them\r\nwould be dumbly resented and would only help to widen even more the\r\ndivision between her and them.\r\n\r\nWhen the meal was finished she put the plates out in the rain to wash\r\nthem. Then a bright idea came to her and getting the roll of wire she\r\nasked La Touche to shew her how to make rabbit snares.\r\n\r\nLa Touche took the roll of wire and held it in his hands for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"This is all very well,\" said he, \"but where is your wire cutters?\"\r\n\r\nThey had nothing to cut the wire with, and he seemed to look on the fact\r\nas a triumph of his own cleverness over Cléo's, till Bompard intervened\r\nand shewed how, by knotting the wire and pulling hard, a break might be\r\nmade. This accomplished, and three lengths of wire having been\r\nprocured, the surly one proceeded to make a snare and to demonstrate how\r\nit might be set.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the business the girl regretted that she had ever started\r\nit. She had put herself under the tuition of La Touche and allowed the\r\nintimacy of master and pupil, allowed even in this slight way that he\r\nwas her superior.\r\n\r\nA yelling wind from the mountains arose that afternoon and drove the\r\nrain away across the islands. It held for half an hour and then of a\r\nsudden ceased and a howling wind from the islands rose and drove the\r\nrain back again towards the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe sea suddenly seemed to go mad, with cross currents meeting. Waves\r\nseemed fighting waves and the gulls seemed filled with the general\r\ntorment, clanging and blowing about hither and thither like leaves in\r\nautumn.\r\n\r\nCléo went to her cave and wrapping herself in one of the blankets, with\r\nthe other folded double to lie upon, took her place upon the floor with\r\nher head on the sailcloth.\r\n\r\nIt was her first really bad moment. Her first moment of real depression.\r\nThe rain and the fact that their position as regarded food was secure,\r\nso that there was nothing to fight against at the moment, conspired to\r\noverthrow her.\r\n\r\nHitherto she had fought bravely and the struggle had kept her up; the\r\nsudden easing of the situation had brought new forces against her. Time\r\nsuddenly appeared before her eyes asking: \"How are you to kill me? You\r\ncan't, you have no weapons. Would you like a book? Would you like\r\nembroidery work to do, companions to talk with, music to listen to?\r\nFate, under the name of civilization, gave you all these and more, they\r\nhave been taken from you and now you see me as I am, the great terror.\"\r\n\r\nShe fought this Bogey by thinking of La Touche. She had raised La Touche\r\nagainst herself. She knew that something in herself had risen against La\r\nTouche.\r\n\r\nShe felt that his respect for a woman of the higher classes was, as\r\nregarded herself, wearing thin, owing to propinquity. That he resented\r\nbeing \"bossed\" by a woman, that her superior quickness of mind and\r\nenergy vexed him and that one day he would try to master her. He was of\r\nthe type that is too mean to rule, yet hates to be ruled. There was also\r\nthe jealousy of the male at the superiority of the female. She was\r\nphysically weaker than he, a fact that means little in civilized life\r\nwhere power is in the hands of Order, but which means everything in\r\nprimitive life. And they were steadily drifting to the primitive.\r\n\r\nThese thoughts, troublesome enough, were still excellent in their way.\r\nThey gave her occupation for her mind.\r\n\r\nThen she fell asleep, awaking towards evening to find Bompard at the\r\ncave mouth telling her that supper was ready.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE QUARREL\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning broke fine. She was awakened by voices quarrelling and came\r\nout to find a breezy and absolutely cloudless day, with the sea running\r\nsmooth and the sunlight on the far islands.\r\n\r\nThe two men, who had fallen out over some trifle, were wrangling like\r\nfish-women, Bompard having the worst of it, as his ineffectual southern\r\noaths were no match for the language of the other.\r\n\r\nThe girl stood looking at La Touche, but he seemed not to mind in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nThen she turned away and walked down to the boat.\r\n\r\nShe heard Bompard say: \"There, you have sent her off, talking like\r\nthat,\" and what La Touche replied she could not hear, but she guessed it\r\nwas something not complimentary to Bompard or herself.\r\n\r\nThe boat was half full of rain-water. She rinsed her hands in it, then,\r\nstanding with the warm sun upon her, she almost forgot the men, looking\r\nat the purple islands and the gulls like new minted gold and the great\r\narch of the bay lined out with a thread of creamy foam.\r\n\r\nAfter a while, turning round, she saw that Bompard was lighting a fire\r\nwith the remains of the wood and, coming up, she helped in the business.\r\n\r\nHe had arranged the little fire between pieces of rock so as to make a\r\nstand for the kettle, and La Touche was opening the hermetically sealed\r\ncanister of tea with his knife; neither man was speaking and the meal\r\npassed off almost in silence.\r\n\r\nShe felt that any moment the quarrel might break out again and her\r\ninstinct was to get away from them.\r\n\r\nShe had left the fisherman's knife and belt in her cave; she went to the\r\ncave and strapped the belt around her waist. The boat hook was lying on\r\nthe sand; she picked it up and, carrying it, walked away down the beach\r\nin the direction of the cache.\r\n\r\nThe boat hook was a weapon of sorts and it was better out of the men's\r\nway; the knife was different. It had come to her that in this place it\r\nwas better to be armed and she determined always to wear it.\r\n\r\nBut no sounds of quarrelling followed her, only the quarrelling of the\r\ngulls, and half a mile away, looking back, she saw that the men had\r\nseparated. La Touche was standing by the boat and Bompard was walking\r\ntowards the Lizard point. She sat down to rest for a moment and she\r\nwatched the figure of Bompard. It grew smaller and smaller till it\r\nreached the point, then it vanished over the rocks.\r\n\r\nShe saw La Touche walk away towards the caves; he disappeared, and the\r\nbeach, now destitute of life, lay sung to by the sea and flown over by\r\nthe gulls. Nothing speaking of man lay there but the boat that looked\r\nlike a toy cast there by a child. It held her eyes, focussed her\r\nthoughts, and became the centre of a sudden longing, a desire soul\r\nsearching as the desire for water--the desire for civilization, for the\r\nthings and people that she knew.\r\n\r\nHer companions had become horrible to her. To go on living with them\r\nseemed appalling. The rocks, the sea, the gulls, even the rain, all\r\nthese fitted with her mind--they seemed in some way familiar, but with\r\nthe men she had nothing in common.\r\n\r\nIt is worse to be wrecked on a social state than on a desert shore. She\r\nwas wrecked on both.\r\n\r\nShe recognised surely that at the rate things were going she would soon,\r\nso far from being above her companions, be below them on account of her\r\nweakness. She recognised that superiority of mind would count little\r\nafter a while with these minds, incapable of distinguishing grades, or\r\nvalues, beyond money value and the distinction of master from man, and\r\nthat sex so far from being a protection would be a danger.\r\n\r\nHer brave mind allowed itself to be borne along for a while on these\r\ncurrents of thought, then it reacted against them, repeating again the\r\nold formula that to think, here, on other things than the moment and\r\nthe material was to die or go distraught.\r\n\r\nShe got up and shifted her position, sitting with her back towards the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nShe could see the penguins, now, drilling beneath the cliff and beyond\r\nthe penguins the figure-head of the ship and beyond that the fuming beach\r\nwith its snow storm of gulls. She was soon to see something that many\r\nwould travel a thousand miles to witness, but unconscious of what was\r\ncoming she sat watching the penguins, then with the boat hook point she\r\nbegan scratching figures on the sand, but with difficulty, on account of\r\nthe length of the staff.\r\n\r\nSitting like this her eyes were suddenly attracted seaward to a point in\r\nthe water beyond the line of the figure-head. Things were moving out\r\nthere, moving rapidly and drawing in-shore and now, riding an incoming\r\nwave, like a half submerged canoe, she saw a dark elongated form. It\r\ncame shooting through the foam just like a beaching canoe and as it\r\ndragged itself up the sand a sound like the far off roar of a lion came\r\nechoing along the cliffs.\r\n\r\nShe knew at once what it was, a sea elephant. Prince Selm had described\r\nthem and how they came ashore at Kerguelen to breed, journeying there\r\nthrough thousands of miles of ocean and arriving in hundreds and\r\nthousands at different points of the coast.\r\n\r\nThis was the first of the great herd and, as she watched, more were\r\ncoming, breasting the waves and breaking from the foam and coming up the\r\nbeach like vast, rapidly-moving slugs.\r\n\r\nThe sight held her fascinated. Every newcomer saluted the land with a\r\nroar. They were the males; the females of the herd, still far out at sea\r\nbeyond the islands, would not land to give birth to their young for\r\nanother fortnight.\r\n\r\nShe watched till perhaps two hundred had beached, then the invasion\r\nceased; there was no more roaring, and over the army of invaders,\r\nlumping along hither and thither on the flat rocks, the sea-gulls flew\r\nand screamed in anger or in welcome, who could say?\r\n\r\nPrince Selm had spoken of how the sea elephants fought together on\r\nlanding. He was wrong. The great, far-distant brutes instead of fighting\r\nseemed resting and sunning themselves and the girl, rising up, came\r\nalong in their direction. She had forgotten Bompard and La Touche.\r\n\r\nShe reached the river which was spating from the recent rains, but great\r\nflat-topped rocks made it always possible to cross; she crossed it.\r\n\r\nThe sea elephants were close to her now and seemed not in the least\r\ndisturbed by her presence, they lay here and there, vast brutes, twenty\r\nfeet in height, weighing tons, raising themselves occasionally on their\r\nflippers and then sinking back to rest with a sigh of contentment.\r\n\r\nShe measured them with her eye, noted the short trunks that seemed so\r\nuseless, the tusks, the old scar marks got in battle and the splendour\r\nof their strength and mass and muscle. Like the land elephants there was\r\nsomething about them terrible yet benign.\r\n\r\nShe drew closer. As regarded animals of any good sort she had the\r\nfearlessness of a child, the instinct that would have been terrified by\r\na reptile or anything truly ferocious however masked by fur or feather.\r\nThese things she felt to be absolutely harmless, as regarded herself,\r\nand they were a million years closer to her than the penguins.\r\n\r\nThe penguins had amused her, but for all their quaintness and politeness\r\nthey seemed as far apart from her as mechanical toys. Her heart had not\r\ngone out to them with that love of living things which lies in the heart\r\nof children, of women and most men.\r\n\r\nShe drew closer still. The great brutes were now watching her\r\nsteadfastly, but seemingly without fear. She had left the boat hook\r\nbehind a mile away, dropping it because of its weight, and with the\r\nexception of the knife in her belt she was unarmed. Perhaps they knew\r\nthis. Vague in their brains must have lain memories of great hurts when\r\nthey were the hunted and men the hunters; but this vision evidently\r\nstored up no antagonistic feelings. Possibly they knew her sex and\r\npossibly the instinct which never failed them told them that she was\r\nfriendly.\r\n\r\nLess than ten yards away from the nearest bull she sat down on a piece\r\nof rock, and no sooner had she taken her seat than they seemed\r\nimmensely closer and her own position one of absolute helplessness. With\r\na sudden rush, moving with that swiftness with which she had seen them\r\nmoving on first landing, the bull could have reached her, but the bull\r\ndid not move, his lordship from the sea, filled with the absolute and\r\ncomplete contentment of the male at rest, moved only his trunk, he\r\nseemed sniffing her and the momentary fear that had seized her passed\r\nutterly away.\r\n\r\nShe could sniff him too. Just as cows fill the air with the fragrance of\r\nmilk the herd filled the place with the scent of fish and fur and a tang\r\nof deep sea like the smell of beach, only sharper and fresher.\r\n\r\nThen, just as people talk to horses and dogs, leaning forward a bit she\r\nbegan to talk to him.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the sweet soothing voice was magical, and for a moment not\r\nin the least soothing. The near bulls moved, evidently deeply disturbed\r\nin their minds. The majority, including the biggest and nearest bull,\r\nturned half away as if to get off, then turned again as if to renew\r\ntheir astonishment.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed, the timidity of this vast force seemed to her less\r\ntimidity than masculine awkwardness, as though a number of heavy old\r\ngentlemen, taking their ease in their club, were suddenly put to\r\nconfusion and flight by a female charmer appearing before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nWHERE IS BOMPARD?\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they had re-settled themselves she rose to go, nodded to them and\r\nturned away towards the river. Then she looked back. The big bull was\r\nfollowing her and the rest of the herd were moving slightly in the same\r\ndirection. The bull paused when she turned, then, when she went on, he\r\ncontinued following her, lazily and as if drawn by some gentle magnetic\r\nattraction.\r\n\r\nAcross the river she turned and waved her hand to them. Then she went\r\non.\r\n\r\nIn some extraordinary way the creatures had made the place less lonely\r\nand the wonder of them pursued her as she walked, keeping to the sand\r\npatches where the rocks were and then striking along the great levels of\r\npure sand.\r\n\r\nHer feet did not hurt her and she was beginning to recognise that touch\r\nwith the world which comes to those who walk without boots, something\r\nthat humanity has all but forgotten, all but ceased to remember.\r\n\r\nAs she drew near the caves she looked for the men, but the beach was\r\ndeserted. Then, looking into the men's cave, she saw La Touche lying on\r\nhis back asleep, his pipe beside him and his arm flung across his eyes.\r\n\r\nWhere was Bompard?\r\n\r\nHe ought to have been back by this, and as she turned and looked up and\r\ndown the beach a vague uneasiness came upon her.\r\n\r\nIt was as if for the first time she had recognized the value of Bompard\r\nin their small society. Bompard with his age and heaviness and patent\r\nhonesty, despite his stupidity, was a presence not to be despised.\r\n\r\nIf La Touche had been another man she might have awakened him to make\r\nenquiries. As it was, she preferred to let him lie.\r\n\r\nBompard she had last seen crossing the rocks of the Lizard point. It was\r\nthere that she must look for him.\r\n\r\nShe went to the cave where she had left her boots and put them on for\r\nthe climb. When she reached the point she found the work easier than she\r\nhad suspected. The rocks were not strewn at random, they were in reality\r\nbreaks off and tables of the basalt; the whole point was like a great\r\nlizard that, creeping stealthily towards the sea, had been stricken into\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nShe climbed, and in five minutes was on the highest point with a new\r\nview of the coast before her. It was like looking at Ferocity. Here the\r\nrocks were broken and tumbled about, indeed, rocks, huge and spired like\r\nchurches, cliffs black and polished with the washing of the waves,\r\nmonoliths standing out in the blue-green water and all ringing and\r\nsinging to the chime of the sea. Inland, cañons of night and shoulders\r\nof dolerite and plains where nothing grew leading to great level\r\nbastions, fortifications that seemed built by rule and plumb line, with\r\nthe markings of the basalt visible through the clear air. Basalt has\r\nthat terrible peculiarity. It seems the work of a hand, it makes castles\r\nand fortifications whose ruled markings bear the inevitable suggestions\r\nof masonry.\r\n\r\nAnd across all that not a sign of life save the wings of the tireless\r\nbirds, teal and duck, cormorants, and beyond the seaward rocks the great\r\nsea geese fishing and the guillemots flighting and the white tern\r\ndarting like dragon-flies.\r\n\r\nWhere was Bompard?\r\n\r\nHad he, by any chance, come back and taken some other road off the\r\nbeach? There was only one way: the break in the cliffs, beyond the\r\ncaves. She thought it highly improbable that he would have come back\r\nonly to leave the beach by another way, the descent from where she stood\r\nand towards the bed country was quite easy, alluringly easy. No, he\r\nwould have gone on.\r\n\r\nShe sat down to rest and watch.\r\n\r\nAt any moment he might appear in the distance. From where she sat the\r\nsea lay straight before her and the far off islands, to the left the\r\nrock strewn coast, to the right the great curving beach.\r\n\r\nBehind her the country stormed away, stern, grey-grim and treeless, to\r\nthe foothills whose misty mauve lay stretched before the mountains.\r\n\r\nEvery now and then she would turn towards the left searching the country\r\nand cliffs with her eyes, but no form appeared.\r\n\r\nShe remembered now that he had talked about sea birds' eggs and how to\r\nget them. Might he have gone hunting for eggs over those cliffs and\r\nfallen?\r\n\r\nShe remembered also when the two men had come back from their expedition\r\ninland they had brought an alarming story of a bog like a quick sand. La\r\nTouche had blundered into it and he would have gone down only for his\r\ncompanion. They had also said something about pot holes like shafts in\r\nthe basalt. She turned her mind away from these thoughts and passing her\r\nfingers through her hair removed the comb which held it in a rough knot,\r\nshaking it free to the sun and wind. She combed it with her fingers and\r\nrearranged it and then looked again--nothing.\r\n\r\nIt came to her suddenly that though she were to sit there forever the\r\nvigil would be useless, that Bompard had gone--never to return.\r\n\r\nShe reasoned with this feeling, and reason only increased her fears. It\r\nwas now noon, Bompard was not the man to go on a long expedition by\r\nhimself; he was too inactive and easy-going. No, something had happened\r\nto him and he might at that moment be lying dead at the foot of some\r\ncliff or he might have broken a leg and be lying at the foot of some\r\nrock unable to move.\r\n\r\nShe rose up and came swiftly down to the beach. Reaching the caves she\r\nfound La Touche opening a tin. It was dinner-time.\r\n\r\n\"What has become of Bompard?\" she asked. \"Have you seen him since he\r\nwent off this morning over those rocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bompard,\" replied the other, \"Mon Dieu! How do I know? No, I have not\r\nseen him, he is big enough to take care of himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" she replied, \"but accidents happen no matter how big a\r\nman may be. He has not returned--\"\r\n\r\n\"So it would seem,\" said La Touche, who had now got the tin open and was\r\nturning the contents on to a plate. \"But he will return when he\r\nremembers that it is dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\nHer lips were dry with anger, there was a contained insolence in the\r\nmanner and voice of the other that roused her as much as his\r\ncallousness. His mind seemed as cold as his pale blue eyes. All her\r\nmixed feelings towards him focussed suddenly into a point--she loathed\r\nhim; but she held herself in.\r\n\r\n\"If he has not returned when we have finished dinner,\" said she, \"we\r\nwill have to look for him.\" She took a plate and some of the beef he had\r\nturned from the tin and with a couple of biscuits drew off and taking\r\nher place outside in the sun began her wretched meal. A rabbit that had\r\nrun out on the sands sat up and looked at her as she ate, then it ran\r\noff and as she followed it with her eyes she contrasted the little\r\nfriendly form with the form of La Touche, the dark innocent eyes with\r\nthose eyes of washed-out blue, without depth, or, perhaps, veiling\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nWhen she had finished eating she put the plate by her side and sat\r\nwaiting for La Touche to make a movement.\r\n\r\nBompard that morning had left his tinder box behind him in the cave, she\r\nheard the strike of flint on steel. La Touche was lighting his pipe. She\r\nwaited ten minutes or more, then she came to the cave mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Are you not coming to look for Bompard?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go when I choose,\" said he, \"I don't want orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gave you no orders,\" she replied, \"I asked you, are you not coming to\r\nlook for Bompard who may be in difficulties, or lying perhaps with a\r\nbroken limb--and you sit there smoking your pipe. But I give you orders\r\nnow; get up and come and help to look for him. Get up at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet and came right out. It seemed to her that she had\r\nnever seen him before. This was the real La Touche.\r\n\r\n\"One word more from you,\" he shouted, \"and I'll show you who's master.\r\nYou! Talk to me, would you! A--woman more trouble than you're worth. Off\r\nwith you, get down the beach--clear!\"\r\n\r\nHe took a step forward with his right fist ready to strike,\r\nopen-handed. Then he drew back. She had whipped the knife from its\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\nThe boat hook, which she had brought back with her, was propped against\r\nthe cliff behind her and out of his reach, he had no weapon.\r\n\r\nShe did not add a word to the threat of the knife. He stood like a fool,\r\nunable to sustain her gaze, venomous, yet held, as a snake is held by a\r\nman's grip.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" she said, \"get on. Go search for your companion and if you dare\r\nto speak to me again like that I will make you repent it. You thought I\r\nwas weak being a woman and alone. You were going to strike. Coward!--Get\r\non, go and search for your companion.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly and walked off towards the Lizard rocks. \"I'll go\r\nwhere I choose,\" said he.\r\n\r\nIt was a lame and impotent end of his rebellion, but she held no\r\ndelusions. This was only the beginning--if Bompard did not return.\r\n\r\nShe put the knife in its sheath and then she put the boat hook away,\r\nhiding it behind the sailcloth in her cave, then she went into the\r\nmen's cave. La Touche's clasp knife lay there on the sand, it was not\r\nmuch of a weapon but she took it. She examined the dinner knives again.\r\nThey were almost useless as weapons. Then she came out. La Touche had\r\ndisappeared beyond the rocks and she came to the boat. There was nothing\r\nhere in the way of a weapon that he might use, unless the oars. They\r\nwere heavy, but he was strong. She determined to leave nothing to\r\nchance and, carrying the oars down the beach to the break in the cliffs,\r\nshe hid them amongst some scrub bushes. Then she remembered the axe,\r\nsought for it and hid it.\r\n\r\nThen she came back and sat down to reconsider matters.\r\n\r\nThe position was as bad as could be.\r\n\r\nAs bad as La Touche. Once let this man get the upper hand and she was\r\nlost. She would be his slave and worse. She had measured him finely.\r\nInstinct, never at fault, told her that to pull down anything above him\r\nwould be meat and drink to La Touche's true nature and that his hatred\r\nof her superiority was deepened by the fact that she was a woman.\r\n\r\nWere she weak he would beat her and make her cook for him, trample on\r\nher, make her his woman to fetch and carry, and, if Bompard did not come\r\nback, she was here alone with him and would have to fight this thing\r\nout.\r\n\r\nWell, she could not fight it by brooding over it, and she was not\r\nhelping to look for Bompard.\r\n\r\nShe drew the knife from its sheath and held the eight inches of razor\r\nsharp steel balanced in her hand for a moment as though admiring it.\r\nThen she replaced it in the sheath and started towards the Lizard\r\nPoint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH TRAPS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the highest shoulder of the point she could see La Touche\r\nclambering over the seaward rocks.\r\n\r\nHe seemed more in search of shells and seaweed than of Bompard. Then,\r\nclimbing down, she reached the lower ground and struck off inland. If\r\nshe did not succeed in finding Bompard she would at least succeed in\r\navoiding La Touche.\r\n\r\nRight from the Lizard Point the plain stretched to higher ground which\r\nmarked the beginning of the sea cliffs, great rocks strewed the way and\r\nthe ground was torn by the beds of small water courses, depressions that\r\nwould suddenly become little rivers in the deluging rains; stunted\r\nbushes huddled as if for shelter at the rock bases and the voice of the\r\nsea came here, broken and mixing with the whisper of the bushes to the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nThis place had once been a glacier bed, rounded boulders standing in\r\npools of water told that.\r\n\r\nA gull flying in from the sea and carrying a fish in its beak drew her\r\nattention; it was being pursued by a larger gull. They were both of the\r\nBurgomaster type, but the fish carrier was noticeable on account of the\r\nintense blackness of its tail plumage.\r\n\r\nAs they passed the fish dropped, fell on a patch of yellow ground just\r\nin front of the girl, sank, and vanished.\r\n\r\nShe stopped dead and drew back with a chill at her heart. Then she\r\npicked up a stone and cast it on the patch of ground. It vanished even\r\nmore swiftly than the fish.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the bogs the men had spoken of. They had described the\r\ntreacherous ground as white, this was yellowish and not very noticeable,\r\nit was also death and another dozen steps would have led her into it.\r\n\r\nShe advanced cautiously, reached the border line and kneeling down\r\npushed her hand into the yellow mud. It was like pushing it into a cold\r\nslimy mouth. She could scarcely draw it out again, when she did the mud\r\nwas clinging to her hand like a yellow glove.\r\n\r\nShe came back to one of the rock ponds and washed her hand, it was like\r\ntrying to get rid of treacle and, as she washed, she tried to fancy what\r\nwould have happened but for the gull, tried to picture herself being\r\nslowly pulled down into that cold darkness and entombed there forever.\r\n\r\nThen, skirting the place of danger, she went on, cautiously, examining\r\ncarefully the ground before her. She had not gone ten yards when it\r\nseemed to her that a patch right in front of her was ever so slightly\r\ndarker and moister looking than the ground she was treading.\r\n\r\nShe picked up a stone and cast it on the patch. It vanished. Then she\r\nknew the feeling of the man who finds himself ambuscaded.\r\n\r\nThis place was a death trap, or, rather, a series of death traps, there\r\nmight be pits lying in wait for her quite unnoticeable. She turned and\r\nbegan to retrace her steps, so shaken that she would not trust even the\r\nground that she had already covered but kept testing it by casting\r\nstones before her.\r\n\r\nFrom a little distance an observer might have fancied her engaged in\r\nsome new sort of game.\r\n\r\nNear the safety of the Lizard rocks her eyes, closely scanning the\r\nground before her, caught sight of something. It was a half-burned\r\nmatch. No one else but Bompard could have dropped that match. He had\r\nstarted without his tinder-box, had evidently found that match in his\r\npocket, lit his pipe and walked on. There was only one direction in\r\nwhich he would have walked unless he had struck inland, which was\r\nimprobable. He would have made as she had made to cross to the higher\r\nground.\r\n\r\nEven if he had walked inland he would not have escaped, for, casting her\r\neyes in that direction she could see yellow patches spreading between\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nShe knew now what had become of Bompard, and with lips dry as pumice\r\nstone she began to climb till she reached the point where she had sat\r\nthat morning. If the mud had taken Bompard, had he cried out? If so, La\r\nTouche would have heard his cries, for the caves were not so far from\r\nthe Lizard rocks.\r\n\r\nLa Touche was nowhere to be seen, but she had no fear about him, or only\r\nthe fear that he would come back. Bompard was gone. Bompard was dead,\r\nshe knew it as though she had seen him engulfed, and she was here alone,\r\nin this place, with La Touche.\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her side automatically to make sure that the knife\r\nwas there. Then she sat with her eyes fixed on the distant islands,\r\nhaze-purple in the light of the westering sun.\r\n\r\nThe thought of the boat on the beach came to her with the idea that she\r\nmight launch it and escape, make for the islands and put all that sea\r\nbetween herself and the man she hated. But she could not launch the boat\r\nsingle-handed and, if she could, it would have been impossible to work\r\nit single-handed with those big oars.\r\n\r\nShe could see the boat from where she sat and the line of the beach\r\nleading away past the seal-nursery and the sea elephant strand to the\r\nrocks that formed the north-eastern horn of the bay. In stormy weather\r\nthose rocks would be invisible in the smoke of the breakers, to-day they\r\nwere clearly defined. She could see the great seals as they moved slowly\r\nhither and thither and the ship's figure-head as it stood to this side\r\nof them and, like a pin point of white the great white skull on the\r\nsands, a desolate scene, but almost benign when compared to the savagery\r\nof rocks and cliffs visible on her other side and that sinister plain,\r\nwhere the death traps were set and waiting with the patience of\r\nmalignity for what might come to feed them.\r\n\r\nShe had fought the human failing that makes men brood and trouble about\r\nthe future, a failing that is mostly born of houses and artificial life;\r\nalready the struggle against it was less. She was coming more and more\r\nunder that which has dominion over all things that live in the open and\r\nhave to fight for life--the moment. If she had examined her own mind she\r\nwould have found that the death of Bompard, of which she felt certain,\r\naffected her far less than it would have done some days ago, that her\r\ndesire to escape to the islands was caused by the hatred of La Touche\r\nmore than by fear of the future with him.\r\n\r\nShe would have found that her capacity for hatred had increased and also\r\nher dangerous qualities, and she would have found all this because God\r\nhad so ordered life that it is adaptable, making the defensive and\r\noffensive qualities of the being capable of increase or decrease in\r\nanswer to environment or need.\r\n\r\nShe came back to the beach. It wanted, still, a couple of hours of\r\nsun-down. There was no sign yet of La Touche, but, just as she knew in\r\nher heart that Bompard was dead she knew that La Touche was all right.\r\nHe had been keeping to the rocks by the sea, leaving that aside; she\r\nknew that he would come back. He was of the sort that remains unscathed\r\nwhen the better man is taken.\r\n\r\nShe had one dread; that La Touche might get the knife from her, throw it\r\naway, and be master by his superior strength.\r\n\r\nShe had his clasp knife in her pocket, but it was a thing of little\r\naccount in a struggle. Well, she must be on her guard. Then came the\r\nthought: \"But how can I be on my guard when I am asleep?\"\r\n\r\nNothing would be easier, if he were really in earnest, than for him to\r\ncreep upon her whilst she slept, and disarm her.\r\n\r\nShe tried to dismiss this idea. La Touche was not crafty enough for that\r\nand, besides, would he go to the lengths of a physical struggle? He had\r\nbeen on the point of hitting her, it was true, but that was in a moment\r\nof excitement. Was she not painting him in too desperate colours?\r\n\r\nArgue as she would on the question, reason, instinctive reason, always\r\ncame back with the same answer: \"Be on your guard, that knife is the\r\nonly barrier between you and heaven knows what. Without it you would be\r\nat the mercy of a superior force. La Touche is no melodramatic villain;\r\nhe is, what is perhaps worse for you, a creature of low instincts,\r\nstronger than you. Beware of being at his mercy.\"\r\n\r\nWith her mind filled by these thoughts she set to work getting supper\r\nready. La Touche had taken the tinder box with him, so a fire was out of\r\nthe question and she contented herself by laying out the beef that had\r\nserved for dinner, and some biscuits.\r\n\r\nThen she saw that she had only laid two plates. Working\r\nhalf-unconsciously she had ruled Bompard out. She looked at the things\r\nlying there on the sand, then she turned away from them. La Touche had\r\ncrossed the rocks and was coming along the beach. He was trailing a long\r\nribband of seaweed he had picked up and as he drew closer she saw that\r\nhe had left his ill-humor behind him.\r\n\r\n\"There was no sight of Bompard,\" said he, \"he has not come back, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bompard will not come back,\" replied the girl, \"we will never see him\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThen she told of the death traps beyond the rocks and of the match.\r\n\r\nLa Touche listened, standing, and still holding the ribband of seaweed\r\nin his fingers.\r\n\r\nShe could see that he believed what she said and yet his words gave the\r\nlie to what was in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bompard will come back all right,\" said he. \"He's not such a fool\r\nas to get into any of those bogs; he's sulking, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nHe shaded his eyes, looking back towards the rocks as though on the\r\nchance of seeing the missing one; then he sat down before his plate and\r\nhelped himself to food and the girl, loathing him and the food as well,\r\nsat down and made a pretence of eating.\r\n\r\nShe noticed that he was cheerful, for a wonder. He ate with good\r\nappetite and shewed in his movements and manner and voice when he spoke\r\na restrained vivacity new to him.\r\n\r\nHis blondness, the washed-out blue of his eyes, his features, his voice,\r\nshe considered all these anew as she sat opposite to him. It seemed to\r\nher that anything truly manly about him had come from the sea; that\r\nessentially he was a product of Mont Martre or the Banlieu of old Paris.\r\nShe loathed him now as only a woman can loathe a man and, woman-like,\r\nher loathing focussed itself upon his blondness and the colour of his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThen, when she had done with the pretence of eating she rose up and,\r\nleaving him to remove the things, walked down to the water's edge and\r\nalong towards the break in the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe tide was nearly out and the sea scarcely broke on the rocks; she had\r\nnever seen it calmer nor the islands closer. They seemed to have drawn\r\nin shore during the last half hour and as she looked she saw a great\r\nflock of gulls coming landward, and, as she turned to watch them, she\r\nnoticed the far-off mountain tops visible through the cliff break. They\r\nwere fuming. One might have fancied that fires had been lit all along\r\ntheir tops and round the highest peak a turban of cloud was winding\r\nitself, coil on coil.\r\n\r\nThen as she stood watching, and from away over, there came a rumble,\r\ndeep and cavernous, as if a gargantuan dray were being driven over\r\nsubterranean roads. It died out in echoes amongst the foothills and\r\nthe silence returned broken only by the wash of the sea on the beach.\r\n\r\nShe turned towards the sea. It had altered suddenly in colour and from\r\naway beyond the islands the wind was coming. She could see it, raking\r\nthe sea like a comb. Then it struck the beach and yelled away up the\r\nbreak in the cliffs like a hunter in a hurry to get to the wild work\r\ngoing on amidst the hills.\r\n\r\nShe turned back towards the caves.\r\n\r\nLa Touche had left the tin plates lying on the sand and the wind, which\r\nseemed to possess a hundred fingers, was chasing them about. He was\r\ntrying to recapture them and as he brought them back he laughed. It was\r\nthe first time she had seen him laugh. Then as he stowed them away he\r\nshewed a disposition towards intimacy and talkativeness.\r\n\r\n\"That's what the winds are in this place,\" said he, \"no wonder ships\r\nsteer clear of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not thinking of the wind,\" said she, \"I'm thinking of Bompard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bompard will come back all right,\" said he, \"the grub's here and\r\nthat will bring him. Bompard will come back all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said she, \"he will never come back and you know it.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned away from him. Dusk was now falling and as she entered her\r\ncave the wind from the sea suddenly fell dead. Almost immediately it\r\nbegan to blow again, but now from the land and as though this land wind\r\nwere spreading a pall over the sky darkness fell suddenly and with the\r\ndarkness she could hear the rain coming with the sound she had heard\r\nonce before like the murmuring of a great top spun by a giant.\r\n\r\nThen the rain burst on the beach with a roar through which came the hiss\r\nof the rain-swept sea.\r\n\r\nThe sound was almost welcome. As she lay in the darkness it seemed like\r\na protecting wall between herself and La Touche. La Touche's ill-temper\r\nwould have disturbed her less than his cheerfulness and amiability, born\r\nso suddenly and from no apparent reasons. She had determined not to\r\nsleep and she had lain down fully dressed; even to the oilskin coat and\r\nwith her boots on; to-morrow she would go off and hide amongst the\r\nbushes beyond the cliff break and get some sleep, but to-night she would\r\nnot close her eyes; so she told herself.\r\n\r\nShe had taken the knife from its sheath and placed it beside her, her\r\nhand rested on it. An hour passed, and now, as she lay listening to the\r\npouring of the rain her fingers felt the pattern of the hilt. The hilt\r\nwas striated cross-ways to give a better grip, and as her fingers\r\nwandered up and down the strictions the cross bars of a ladder were\r\nsuggested to her. The steady pouring of the rain seemed to work on this\r\nidea and make it more real. Then she was climbing a ladder set against\r\nthe cliffs. La Touche was holding it at the foot and Bompard was waiting\r\nfor her at the cliff top. He helped her up and then the dream changed\r\nto something else, and to something else, till she woke suddenly to the\r\nrecognition that she had been asleep for a long time and that fear,\r\ndeadly fear, was clutching her by the throat.\r\n\r\nShe sat up, leaning on her elbow. The rain was still falling, though the\r\nsound of it was much less, and the blackness was so intense that it\r\nseemed moulded round her. She felt for the knife and found it. Then she\r\nlay down again, listening.\r\n\r\nThe tide was coming in and she recognised, and not for the first time, a\r\ncurious singing, chanting echo that always accompanied the waves of the\r\nincoming tide.\r\n\r\nFear is reasonless, it is also Protean, and this sea voice coming\r\nthrough the night turned the fear of La Touche to the fear of Bompard.\r\nWhat if he were to return, cold and wet, from that terrible grave-yard\r\nbeyond the rocks?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE STROKE\r\n\r\n\r\nAs she lay, listening, through the black darkness and the singing of the\r\nsea came a faint sound as of something dragging itself along the sand at\r\nthe cave entrance. She clutched the knife and sat up. A waft of wind\r\nbrought with it a tang of stale tobacco and rain-wet clothes. It was La\r\nTouche.\r\n\r\nShe drew up her feet and sat crouched against the sailcloth, the knife\r\nhalf-held in her lap, her fingers nerveless, her mind paralysed with the\r\nknowledge that now, immediately, she would _have_ to fight, that the\r\nBeast was all but upon her. She knew.\r\n\r\nShe could hear him breathing now and the faint sound of his hands\r\nfeeling gently over the floor of the cave. He was searching for her, the\r\nfume of him filled the place, he was almost in touch with her, yet still\r\nshe sat helpless as a little child, paralysed in the blackness, as a\r\nbird before a crawling cat. Yet her right hand as though endowed with a\r\nvolition of its own was tightening its grasp upon the hilt of the knife.\r\n\r\nShe had no longer reasoning power. Reasoning power and energy seemed\r\nnow in the possession of the knife.\r\n\r\nThen something touched her left boot and at the touch her hand struck\r\nout into the darkness, blindly and furiously, driving the knife home to\r\nthe hilt in something that fell with a choking sound across her feet.\r\nShe forced her feet from the thing that had suddenly fallen on them,\r\nrose, sprang across it and passed through the cave entrance with the\r\nsurety of a person moving in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nThen the pouring rain on her face brought her to her full senses and\r\nrecognition of what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe knife was still in her hand and her hand was sticky and damp.\r\n\r\nShe said to herself: \"That is his blood.\" The thought that perhaps she\r\nhad killed him did not occur to her. The fear of him was still so\r\nintense, that it made him alive, alive somewhere in the surrounding\r\ndarkness, and waiting to seize her. Then she began to steal off towards\r\nthe sound of the sea. Twice as she went she stopped and turned, ready to\r\nstrike again, then when the water was washing round her feet she came up\r\nthe beach a few paces and crouched down.\r\n\r\nThe sea was at her back and the haunting dread of being followed\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nIt was now that she asked herself the question: \"Have I killed him?\"\r\nMeaning:--\"Have I freed myself of him,\"--hoping this was so.\r\n\r\nThe terror behind her having vanished she was now brave. It seemed to\r\nher that the sound of the sea had become sharper; then she realized that\r\nthe sound of the rain had ceased. Her mind seemed working in a dual\r\nmanner and she had not fully recognized the cessation of the rain till\r\nthe sound of the sea clinched the fact.\r\n\r\nThrough the clear night now came the melancholy crying of the whale\r\nbirds, and through the broken clouds a ray of the moon shewed a faint\r\nlight in which the cliffs began to stand out.\r\n\r\nThe incoming tide washed round her so that she had to move, it seemed\r\ndetermined to drive her up to the caves. She could see now the whole\r\nbeach desolate of life and before her, vaguely sketched in the cliff\r\nwall, the cave openings.\r\n\r\nShe came along the sea edge till she reached the break in the cliffs,\r\nthen, looking behind her again to make sure, she took refuge in the\r\nbushes.\r\n\r\nFor the last few yards before reaching them she seemed wading through\r\ntides of nothingness. In the shelter of the bushes she forgot\r\neverything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nALONE\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was awakened by the light of day. Kerguelen had cleared its face of\r\nclouds and the new risen sun was on sea and mountains and land.\r\n\r\nA whole family of rabbits were disporting themselves close to her in a\r\nclear space between the bushes and as she sat up they darted off, a\r\nglimpse of their cotton white tails shewing for a moment in the sun.\r\n\r\nShe was stiff from the damp, her clothes were wet despite the oilskin\r\ncoat which she had left open, and her throat was sore, every bone ached\r\nas though she had been beaten. Her soul felt sick. It was as though the\r\ncrawling beast of the night before had crawled over it like a slug,\r\npoisoning it. The knife lay beside her; she picked it up and looked at\r\nit; there were red traces upon the hilt and the lines in the palm of her\r\nright hand were red. She rubbed it clean with the damp leaves of the\r\nbushes, then she stood up, shaking and weak, heedless of everything but\r\nthe friendly touch of the sun. Her fear was gone, but the effect of it\r\nremained in a sense of bruising and injury.\r\n\r\nOut on the beach there was nothing, nothing but the breaking sea and the\r\nflying gulls and lines of long legged gulls stalking or standing on the\r\nsands, the 'get-away--get-away' of the kittiwakes came across the water\r\nand the barking of brent geese from beyond the rocks of the Lizard\r\nPoint. The boat lay there on its side, everything was the same.\r\n\r\nShe drew towards the caves. Nothing stirred there. Then she halted and,\r\nchanging her course, came right down to the water's edge. From here she\r\ncould see the three cave mouths dark cut in the cliff. She watched them\r\nfor a moment as though expecting something to appear, then she came up\r\ntowards them, walking more cautiously as she drew near, just as she had\r\nwalked on the plain where the death traps were.\r\n\r\nThe light shone into the cave where she had slept. She saw a naked foot\r\nwith toes dug into the sand and beyond the foot a form lying on its\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThen she drew back with a cry; something was moving there. A rabbit\r\ndashed out of the cave and scuttered away along the cliff base. Then she\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nLa Touche was dead, he would never crawl again. She had killed him. She\r\ncast the knife on the sand and wiped the palm of her hand on her dress\r\nhalf unconsciously, gazing at the foot.\r\n\r\nThe terror of him had burned away anything in her mind that might have\r\nfed remorse. She had not killed him consciously. Searching her memory\r\nshe could vaguely recollect having struck out against something\r\nappalling in the darkness. Now she knew and guessed all, and she could\r\nhave hated him only that death kills hatred.\r\n\r\nShe came to the mouth of the men's cave and sat down in the sun, the\r\nsoreness of her throat, the weariness of her very bones, the feel of her\r\nhorrible wet clothes, all these filled her with a craving for the sun\r\nand its warmth and light, fierce as the craving for drink. She spread\r\nout her hands to it, then, with shaking fingers she began to take off\r\nher clothes. They clung to her like evil things. Had this been a day of\r\npouring rain she might just have lain down and died.\r\n\r\nWithout getting up, and leaning on her elbow, she spread out the skirt\r\nand coat and other things on the sand beside her, then she stretched her\r\naching limbs to the warmth.\r\n\r\nThe wind had fallen to almost a dead calm, and as she lay she saw little\r\nrabbits stealing out to play in the sunshine on the sands. She watched\r\nthem running in circles like things on wheels and moving by clockwork.\r\nThen she closed her eyes, but still she saw them circling, circling,\r\ncircling.\r\n\r\nThen she was in the toy department of the Magazin du Louvre and a\r\nshop-woman was shewing her toy rabbits that ran in circles, five francs\r\neach.\r\n\r\nShe awoke at noon; the sore throat was gone, her bones no longer ached\r\nand the great beach lay under the heat of noon, humming like a\r\nstretched string to the touch of the sea.\r\n\r\nHer left arm and side and thigh were scorched by the sun, but that was\r\nnothing; the sense of illness was gone, and her mind, quite clear and\r\nrenewed, had regained its balance.\r\n\r\nShe remembered everything. La Touche was lying there in the cave, dead.\r\nThe knife that had killed him she could see lying on the sand where she\r\nhad dropped it; she had killed him. All these monstrous facts seemed\r\nold, settled and done with and of little more interest than the things\r\nand events of a year ago.\r\n\r\nWhat seemed new was the beach and its desolation--its emptiness. It was\r\nas though a crowd of people had suddenly vanished from it; a crowd that\r\nany moment might return. The place seemed waiting and watching.\r\n\r\nShe cast her eyes towards the rocks of the Lizard Point and then towards\r\nthe cave mouth; then hurriedly she began to put on her clothes, now dry\r\nand warm, and having dressed she stood for a moment again looking about\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe could see the penguins in the distance going through their endless\r\nevolutions, and the rhythmical sound of the sea came from near and far\r\nmixed with the chanting and crying of the gulls. At any moment Bompard\r\nmight appear labouring over those rocks, at any moment La Touche might\r\nstep from the cave where he lay. That is what the beach told her, though\r\nshe knew that the forms of the two men would appear no more; that she\r\nwas here alone, utterly alone.\r\n\r\nShe took shelter from the sun in the men's cave. Bompard's tinder box\r\nwas lying on the sand and half a box of Swedish matches. The men's\r\nblankets were tossed in a corner and the provisions and utensils were in\r\ntheir proper place. On a plate by the bags of biscuits lay the remains\r\nof the beef from last night's supper; she took it and ate it with a\r\nbiscuit, sitting on the floor of the cave and staring before her out at\r\nthe strip of beach where the boat lay on its side with the sea breaking\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nOn the day the men had gone off inland on their expedition she had\r\nterrified herself with fancies of what it would be like were she to find\r\nherself here alone. Her imagination had gone far from the reality.\r\n\r\nThe thing had happened; the men were gone, gone forever, yet she was not\r\nalone. They filled the place by their absence far more than they had\r\nfilled it by their presence.\r\n\r\nThe louder cry of a gull outside seemed hailing Bompard, the rustle of a\r\nrabbit on the sands seemed the coming of La Touche, the sound of the sea\r\nspoke of them, the boat seemed only waiting for them to launch it. They,\r\nwhom a million years would not bring back.\r\n\r\nShe felt neither regret for the fate of La Touche nor sorrow for the\r\nfate of Bompard, all that seemed unreal, just as the darkness and terror\r\nof the night before seemed unreal. The real thing that touched her\r\nthrough everything was Expectancy. Expectancy, ghostly and attenuated,\r\nyet ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nIt brought her to the cave mouth before she had finished her meal. The\r\nbeach seemed to say to her: \"Come out and look!\" and she came out and\r\nlooked, and the line of foam and the wheeling or stalking gulls held her\r\nfor a moment as though saying--a moment, a moment more and you will see\r\nsomething. They will come. Any moment now you may see Bompard crossing\r\nthe rocks. La Touche is not in that cave, he is here, everywhere.\r\n\r\nShe came back into the cave and sat down and finished her meal, the food\r\nhad renewed her strength and with renewed strength her indifference to\r\nall that had happened began to pass.\r\n\r\nShe had killed La Touche. The reality of that fact was coming home to\r\nher now; she did not reason in the least on the matter saying he\r\ndeserved to be killed, that had all been settled long ago in her mind,\r\nbut the fact that she had killed him was standing strongly out before\r\nher, also the facts that he was dead and lying quite close to her and\r\nthat though she did not mind his dead body she was beginning to dread\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nDead, he was beginning to frighten her just as he had frightened her\r\nwhen living. Then she found that it was just the same with Bompard. He\r\nwas frightening her too.\r\n\r\nSuppose one or the other were to peep in at her, and nod at her--she\r\npictured it and then crushed the picture in her mind and got up and came\r\nout again and stood in the sun.\r\n\r\nThen she came down to the boat and stood with her hand on the gunnel,\r\nand, for a moment as she stood thus, the terror of utter loneliness came\r\nto her in a hundred tongues and ways, and always with reference to the\r\nmen who had vanished.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to stay here alone--alone--absolutely alone; like a\r\nfrightened child her mind appealed against this terror; it climbed the\r\nvacant skies and passed over the desolate hills in search of comfort.\r\nWas there a God? To whom could she run for comfort, for escape--?\r\n\r\nAs if in answer to her wild but unspoken question came a far-off roar\r\nbrought on the wind from the great seal beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nFRIENDS IN DESOLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nShe turned her face that way and stood for a moment with the faint\r\nbreeze blowing her hair. Then she came running up the beach to the\r\ncaves. In the men's cave she stood glancing rapidly about her like a\r\nperson in a burning house seeking what he may save.\r\n\r\nShe picked up the tinder box and the box of matches and put them in her\r\npocket. Then she began to remove everything from the cave. Making a sack\r\nof one of the blankets, she filled it with as much as she could drag\r\nalong and brought it to the break in the cliffs where she dumped the\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nIt took her three journeys. Then, having collected everything in a big\r\npile, she sat down for a moment to rest. The things would be safe here\r\ntill she could fetch them to her new home, and the weather would not\r\nhurt them, except, maybe, the biscuits.\r\n\r\nThe thought of the biscuits troubled her, and the picture of them lying\r\nexposed in one of the torrential rains. Then she caught sight of a cleft\r\nin the basalt. It was dry and big enough to contain the bags and she\r\nplaced them there having taken out some of their contents.\r\n\r\nThese and a couple of tins of meat she placed in one of the blankets,\r\nmaking a sack of it. Then she remembered the knife she had left lying on\r\nthe sand before the cave where the dead man lay.\r\n\r\nShe fought against the idea of returning for it. Then her will made her\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nAs she picked up the knife she glanced once again into the cave and once\r\nagain caught a glimpse of the naked foot with the toe dug into the sand;\r\nthen, placing the knife in its sheath and running like a frightened\r\nchild she reached the break, caught up the sack, the extra blanket and\r\nthe axe, which she had hidden among the bushes, and started.\r\n\r\nIt was not a heavy load, fortunately. Had it been heavy she would have\r\ndropped it, for, once moving, she had to run. The idea that she was\r\ndeserting people who did not want to be deserted pursued her; now and\r\nagain she stopped and turned for a moment--nothing; the Lizard rocks lay\r\njust the same and the beach and the forsaken boat, just the same, and\r\nthe jeering gulls; yet, when she turned again to go on she had to run.\r\n\r\nNear the great skull her right bootlace, getting loose, nearly tripped\r\nher. She sat down and tied it and then went on, walking now, but\r\nswiftly, till, nearing the river and in full sight of her new\r\ncompanions, she found herself suddenly free.\r\n\r\nThe hounds of Fear had given up the chase. The great sea elephants had\r\ndriven them away. Here was no longer loneliness.\r\n\r\nThe great beasts sunning themselves on the flat rocks seemed more\r\nnumerous and, as she crossed the river, a monster coming in from the sea\r\nin a thunder of foam saluted the land with a roar.\r\n\r\nShe recognized, or thought she recognized, the great bull that had\r\nfollowed her, he was lying, to-day, half-tilted to one side, he looked\r\ndrunk with sun and laziness and as she came amongst them and sat down,\r\nas she had sat that day, she found that though a hundred pairs of eyes\r\nwere watching her, scarcely a burly figure moved.\r\n\r\nThey had grown used to her, perhaps, or perhaps they recognized that she\r\ndid not fear them now in the least, or that she had come for refuge and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nThen she rose up and passing amongst them as a friend amongst friends\r\ncame towards the caves in the basalt cliffs. They were smaller than the\r\ncaves to the west but they were dry and free from water drip. She chose\r\none and put her bundle down with the axe beside it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nGOD MADE FRIENDSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place was as populous as a town. That was the soul-satisfying fact\r\nwhich she absorbed as she sat with the bundle and axe beside her. To be\r\nlonely here one would have to be deaf and blind and without the sense of\r\nsmell. Now that their attention was no longer strained by watching her\r\nthe great brutes filled the place with all sorts of sounds, grunts and\r\ngrumbles, puffs and snorts like the escape of steam from a locomotive\r\nand now and then the flop of a great body changing position. There was\r\nanother sound she got to know and recognize, after a while, the\r\ngrumbling and rumbling of their interiors. Infested with sea-lice they\r\nwere always scratching. Quite close to the cave mouth three great bulls\r\nwere lying and every now and then one of them would turn and twist round\r\nand scratch himself with his flippers, the nearest bull had lost an eye\r\nin some past battle and they were all scarred about the necks, and seen\r\nclose like this, in their natural state and as one of their company, the\r\nmarvel of them, was beyond speaking.\r\n\r\nShe took off the oilskin coat and laid it on the sand of the cave, took\r\nthe things from the blanket and spread the two blankets out and folded\r\nthem. As she moved about she saw that the bulls had turned slightly,\r\nattracted by her movements, but they shewed not the slightest sign of\r\nmind disturbance. Then, having placed the things in order, she came out\r\nand walked down to the water's edge, making a detour now and then to\r\navoid treading on the flippers or the tail of a monster. On coming\r\namongst them a few minutes ago she had felt not the slightest fear, but\r\nthis walk in cold blood from the cliff to the sea edge made her hold her\r\nbreath. She felt as she had felt that first day when she sat down close\r\nto them. Angry, and with a sudden movement, one of these creatures could\r\nhave destroyed her as a man destroys a fly; but she held on, and was\r\nrewarded.\r\n\r\nNot one of them shewed any wish to destroy her, or anger, or uneasiness.\r\nThey had accepted her into their company by not attacking or ejecting\r\nher, she ran counter to none of their desires or needs and evidently her\r\nform called up no recollections of the beast Man in their dim brains.\r\n\r\nThen she was a female. Sex is more than a physical difference between\r\none being and another, one can fancy it as one of the outstanding signs\r\nof the Wild to be read by instinct, as instinct reads the weather or\r\nseason signs, or the sea mile posts that lead the seals and sea\r\nelephants thousands of leagues to strike some particular beach as an\r\narrow strikes the bull's eye of a target.\r\n\r\nThe female, unless with young, is not dangerous to the male. One may\r\nfancy that amongst the few but burningly important warnings and\r\ndirections in the book of Instinct.\r\n\r\nHere, at the sea edge and within a few feet of the breaking waves, she\r\nsat down on a projecting rock and tried to measure with her eye the vast\r\nherd. The whole beach from where she sat to where the flat rocks ceased\r\na mile and a half away on her right was spotted with them and she\r\nnoticed that here and there they were always putting out to sea and\r\ncoming ashore again.\r\n\r\nMaking for a spot on the right, a hundred yards from her she saw one\r\ncoming ashore, swift as an arrow, steering with straight steadfast eyes\r\nand landing with the water cascading from his huge shoulders, whilst on\r\nthe left one was putting out to sea in a burst of foam.\r\n\r\nThen, of a sudden, all the shore edge bulls got in commotion slithering\r\nabout, raising themselves on their flippers and blowing off steam.\r\n\r\nA sea elephant was coming towards the beach, moving with a speed thrice\r\nthat of any of the others, his head was raised and she could see the\r\neyes that seemed blazing with wrath or challenge.\r\n\r\nThen, as he came thundering on to the rocks, he lifted the echoes with a\r\nroar that resounded for miles along the beach.\r\n\r\nAll the others had landed in silence.\r\n\r\nShe did not know that this was a newcomer, a belated bull, held days\r\nbehind the arrival of the others by some chance of the sea. Maybe he\r\nhad hung fishing off the South Shetlands or the Horn, or beached for\r\nrepairs after some sea fight off the Falklands; whatever had held him he\r\nwas late.\r\n\r\nHe came swiftly up the rocks, casting his head from side to side but\r\nunchallenged. There were no females there yet to fight for and they\r\nevidently recognized him as one of the herd and not a stranger. The herd\r\ninstinct, without which a nation would be a mob, ruled here and gave the\r\nbelated one his place, and after a while of squattering about and\r\nsniffing and blowing he settled down with quieted eyes to rest. He had\r\nreached one of the stopping stages of his life, with the surety with\r\nwhich he would reach the last, on some desolate beach or reef of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe girl watched him. Not only did these new-found companions chase away\r\nloneliness and ghostly fears, but they brought her comfort. They seemed\r\nso sure, sure of food and life and the right to live, so undisturbed; it\r\nwas as though she felt the presence of the ghostly shepherd who looks\r\nafter the flocks of sea and land and who counts even the sparrows. She\r\ncast her eyes towards the islands and the sea-line; some day a ship would\r\ncome and all this would be a dream of the past. She knew it. Her mind\r\nwent back over all that she had been saved from--the wreck, the\r\ndeathtraps and worst of all--La Touche. It was strange to think that a\r\nman should be worse than the others.\r\n\r\nIf that fisherman's knife had not been included in the gear of the boat!\r\n\r\nIt was now, as she sat thinking this and watching the huge harmless\r\nthings around her, that a hatred of La Touche came into her mind, a\r\nhatred that seemed to have been waiting to enter until her mind was at\r\nrest. He seemed to her evil itself. He seemed to her connected with all\r\nthe disasters that had happened and part of them. He had been the\r\nlookout on the _Gaston de Paris_, his quarrel had sent Bompard to his\r\ndeath, he had nearly unhinged her mind with terror. Had he possessed the\r\nevil eye? Then, for the first time, she recalled her premonition of\r\ndisaster, yet, how she had refused to let the yacht be put off its\r\ncourse. They might now have been at New Amsterdam only for that. Yet it\r\nwas not her fault. She had refused to alter the course, not for any\r\nselfish reason, quite the reverse, she had refused because she did not\r\nwish to spoil the plans of her host. It was Fate, not blind Fate,\r\nbecause the premonition was full sighted, it was Fate obeying some\r\norder. And it seemed to her that she could read in the order that she\r\nwas to be saved. Why? God only knew, but so she read the facts, and she\r\nwould be saved to the end and go back to the life she knew, or had known\r\nand die, perhaps, at last an old, old woman.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that this coming on to the sea elephant beach was a\r\nstage in her great journey that had brought her definitely nearer to the\r\nend of her loneliness. And whether all this were true knowledge or\r\nwhether it was only the fancy of the ego its effect was to give her\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nThen, as she sat there the strangest lonely figure on earth, she\r\nexplored the pocket of her skirt and took the things from it. La\r\nTouche's knife, her rings knotted up in her handkerchief, the tobacco\r\nbox of Captain Slocum, the tinder-box and box of matches. Then she\r\nopened the tobacco box and re-read the purple writing with the tag \"keep\r\nup your spirits.\" She could not visualize the old slab-sided whaling\r\ncaptain who had scrawled that, inspired no doubt by practical knowledge\r\nof disaster and the horrors of Kerguelen, but the message came now as an\r\nadditional comfort, it seemed to her written by a hand other than that\r\nof man. She put the paper back in the box and, then, everything back in\r\nher pocket.\r\n\r\nThen, like a stroke of humour, an incident occurred to lighten the whole\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nA big platoon of penguins had crossed the river and marched up to the\r\nsacred precincts of the seal beach. Turning her head to see what the\r\ndisturbance was about she sighted the penguins just at the end of their\r\nmarch and three bulls fronting them. The penguins wished to pass, either\r\nfrom impudence or a real desire to cross the beach, but the bulls barred\r\nthe way, heading them off, turning and twisting, snorting as if to blow\r\nthe feathered ones away.\r\n\r\nThe penguins bowed and scraped and explained, but the bulls, blind to\r\npoliteness and deaf to argument only presented their heads, then they\r\nraised their rumps and made a half charge. The girl watched the penguins\r\ngoing at the double with heads slewed round as though fearful of their\r\ntails. Then she laughed.\r\n\r\nThe sea elephants had not only made her able to laugh, they had given\r\nher something to laugh over. Then came the thought: why had they refused\r\nthe penguins and accepted her?\r\n\r\nShe did not know that the penguins were rival fishermen, she fancied\r\nthat the sea elephants were somehow friendly to her, divining her\r\nfriendship for them, and maybe she was right, though not perhaps in the\r\nway she fancied, for when God made friendship He made it out of queer\r\nand sometimes negative materials.\r\n\r\nThat night as she lay in her cave with a rolled-up blanket for pillow\r\nand the other blanket for covering, neither Ghosts nor Loneliness came\r\nto trouble her.\r\n\r\nTwo great bulls a few yards from the cave's mouth kept her warm and\r\ncomfortable of mind.\r\n\r\nShe could hear their puffs and grunts and the occasional wobble-wobble\r\nof their digestive organs as they slept, dreaming maybe in their sleep,\r\nfor sometimes they tossed and moved, and once one of them gave a \"woof\"\r\nas though trying to roar under the blanket of sleep.\r\n\r\nShe thought of dogs lying asleep; dogs dreamed and hunted in their\r\ndreams, why should not these?\r\n\r\nThen suddenly the rain came down as though someone had pulled the\r\nstring of a shower bath, but she knew that would not drive them away,\r\nguessing that rain to sea elephants was no more disturbing than sun to\r\npeaches.\r\n\r\nThen she was chasing penguins along the beach, riding on a sea elephant\r\ntowards that absolute oblivion which is the brand of sleep they serve at\r\nKerguelen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt rained off and on for three days, but rain in Kerguelen is not the\r\nsame as rain in England, just as rain at Windmere is not the same as\r\nrain at Birmingham. It does not depress, especially when you are busy.\r\nIn those three days she made three journeys to the break in the cliffs\r\nto recover the things she had left there and she made her journeys, not\r\nto put too fine a point on it, with nothing on but the oilskin coat, the\r\nblanket she used for a sack got hopelessly soaked and her head was\r\nexposed to the rain owing to the fact that the sou'wester was in the\r\ncave where the dead man lay, but she got used to it, especially as\r\nneuralgia and colds are unknown in Kerguelen.\r\n\r\nThe loss of her only towel, the lump of cotton waste, was far worse than\r\nthe loss of the sou'wester and would have been worse still only that she\r\nhad other things to think about, especially on these journeys. They were\r\nterrible and required all her fortitude to make them, and they were\r\nterrible for a new reason. The birds had got at La Touche. Great\r\npredatory birds like cormorants thronged the beach opposite the cave,\r\nshe could see them going in and out of the cave and she could hear them\r\nquarrelling in there in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThen, on her last journey, as she was preparing to come back, happening\r\nto glance that way she saw a gull like a Burgomaster coming out of the\r\ncave mouth and pulling after it something long like a rope upon which\r\nthe other gulls flung themselves. She turned and ran.\r\n\r\nShe had saved everything but one full bag of biscuits; she determined to\r\nleave them. If worst came to the worst there was bread stuff in the\r\ncache.\r\n\r\nThat night the memory of what she had seen haunted her sleep. It was as\r\nthough La Touche, unable to get at her in the material world was\r\ndetermined to torment her in the imaginary.\r\n\r\nShe lay awake listening to the whale birds crying and the divers mewing\r\nand quarrelling like cats, then, dropping asleep, she was awakened at\r\ndawn by a new sound. Outside on the beach she heard a moaning like the\r\nvoice of someone in pain.\r\n\r\nShe raised herself on her elbow. It was a human voice without any manner\r\nof doubt. It ceased, and springing to her feet she came out. But there\r\nwas no human being on the beach, nothing but the bulky forms of the\r\ngreat sea bulls, and quite close to the cave a smaller form, a female\r\nthat had landed during the night and had just given birth to a baby, a\r\nthing like a slug which she was fondling with her flippers.\r\n\r\nThen in the strengthening light the girl could make out here and there\r\non the beach the forms of other females, and by noon that day there were\r\nhundreds and hundreds, and on the next day the beach was one vast\r\nnursery. It was the first great act in the life history of these sea\r\npeople towards which the girl's heart was going out more and more, and\r\nas she sat that day watching the mothers and their babies, and the great\r\nold bulls shuffling about like heavy fathers, sometimes she would smile\r\nand sometimes, sitting and watching, her mind would wander away lost and\r\ntrying to grapple with the great mystery of which all this was only a\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThey were so human, so warm to the heart, and yet only a few days ago\r\nthere was nothing here but the rocks and the cold and trackless sea.\r\nThen she noticed that to-day the bulls were not sunning themselves\r\nlazily, although the sun was out. They seemed disturbed, moving about\r\naimlessly, lifting themselves on their flippers and now and then raising\r\ntheir short trunks.\r\n\r\nSometimes a female would make as if to get back to the sea but she was\r\nalways headed off by a bull.\r\n\r\nWhen dusk fell it seemed that the sentries were doubled, to judge by the\r\nnoise of the flopping and moving about. The girl came to the cave\r\nentrance and looked, and lo and behold! every bull had cleared down\r\ntowards the sea edge. She could see them stretching away into the dim\r\ndistance, a hedge of vast forms broken and moving here and there, but\r\nalways restored.\r\n\r\nShe thought that this line of defence was to keep the females back from\r\nthe water, yet there seemed more than mere precaution at the bottom of\r\nthe general disturbance that filled the beach. Then as she lay awake she\r\ncould hear now and then a distant roar and once a big bull only a few\r\nhundred yards from the cave took it into his head to give tongue with a\r\nblast like the first deep \"woof\" of a siren, then came another sound\r\nquite close to the cave entrance, a sound like the broken lapping of\r\nripples, interrupted by movements and little snorts and sighs. It was a\r\nbaby seal sucking away at the teats of its mother. The pair was just\r\noutside the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nVÆ VICTIS\r\n\r\n\r\nA Howling wind that rose at midnight carrying niagaras of rain oversea\r\nfrom the mountains sank at dawn leaving a clear sky and a falling sea.\r\n\r\nAs she came out into the early morning light she could see boosts of\r\nspray all along the rocks, but by the time she had tidied things up and\r\nfinished her breakfast these had vanished and the water was coming in,\r\nrolling lazily, and the sounds of the breakers came sleepy and evenly\r\nspaced as though ruled by a metronome.\r\n\r\nThe bulls no longer lined the shore, though keeping close to the water\r\nthey had broken up into groups, yet still the sense of disturbance was\r\nthere pervading the beach like an atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe tide was just turning back from the flood, and as she stood watching\r\nshe noticed the curious fact that not a single bull was taking to the\r\nwater; ordinarily, here and there along the rocks, there was always some\r\nmonster taking a header, some vast bulk beaching in a potter of foam.\r\nThis morning there was nothing of this sort.\r\n\r\nPicking her way between the mothers and their babies she came down to\r\nthe sea edge, choosing a broad space left vacant because of the bad\r\nlanding conditions. The rocks here were higher, forming a miniature\r\ncliff some four or five feet in height and from this point looking\r\nseaward something caught her eye.\r\n\r\nThree black objects moving in a line were making a long ripple on the\r\nswell. They were the heads of three sea elephants moving like one. Then\r\nthe line became the segment of a circle bending in shore. But the\r\nswimmers were not going to land; they kept parallel to the rocks and a\r\nfew hundred yards out, and as they passed she could see clearly the\r\ngreat heads and sometimes the massive shoulders rising and washing away\r\nthe water and the eyes, as the heads swung now and then shorewards,\r\nwicked eyes that seemed to blaze with the light of anger or battle.\r\n\r\nShe was not alone in observing them. They had been spotted by a\r\ntrumpet-voiced sentry and instantly the whole place was in commotion.\r\nThe air split with a roar that passed along from section to section of\r\nthe beach whilst the cliffs resounded and a thousand sea-gulls rose as\r\nif from nowhere, crying, cat-calling and making a snowstorm in the\r\nsunlight.\r\n\r\nOn the roar and as if destroyed by it the three heads vanished.\r\n\r\nThen, far out, they reappeared, only to dive again, leaving the sea\r\nblank, but for a school of porpoises passing along on their quiet\r\nbusiness a mile away towards the east.\r\n\r\nThe girl sat watching. There was something in all this of greater import\r\nthan the appearance of three swimming sea elephants. The beach told her\r\nthat. Not a bull in all that vast herd but was in motion, either helping\r\nto crowd the females back towards the cliffs or patrolling the rocks.\r\nShe could see them here and there rising up on their hind-quarters as\r\nthough to get a better view of the sea. They reminded her of dogs\r\nbegging for biscuits. Then, turning her eyes seaward again she saw a\r\nblack spot; it was a moving head. Then another broke the surface and\r\nanother, till in a moment, and for a mile-long stretch, hundreds of\r\nheads appeared, all driving shorewards and then dipping and vanishing\r\nonly to reappear still closer in and closing on the beach with the\r\nswiftness of destroyers.\r\n\r\nThen she knew, and, springing up, turned to run; but her retreat was cut\r\noff towards the caves by the females herded up and, before she could\r\ncollect her thoughts, the army of invasion was flinging itself from the\r\nwater, and the whole sea beach from end to end was filled with the\r\nthunder of battle.\r\n\r\nFor days the lone bulls had been cruising at sea waiting and watching\r\ntill all the females were on shore under guard of their husbands. So it\r\nhappened every year as now, ending in a battle for the possession of\r\nwives, a battle waged without quarter and with a fury whose sound\r\nreached the echoes of the hills.\r\n\r\nSafe on the little rock plateau she watched the thunderous onslaught,\r\nfrightened and then terrified and crying out.\r\n\r\nThe invaders drove in from the sea like the sweep of a curved sword.\r\nThey struck the beach first a mile away and the battle ran towards her\r\nlike fire along tinder, boomed towards her ever loudening till it broke\r\nto right and left where the sea bulls flung themselves on the rocks and\r\nthe land bulls charged the on-comers like battering rams. Some were\r\nhurled back, only to return again, others held their ground. Then the\r\nreal business began whilst the ground trembled and the air shook and the\r\nrocks poured blood.\r\n\r\nRound her, and for a mile away, they fought like rams and they fought\r\nlike dogs and they fought like tigers, and over the roaring siren sounds\r\nof the fight the gulls flew like the fume of it, screaming and swooping\r\nand circling in spirals, and through everything like the continuous\r\nthud-thud of a propeller came the dunch of tons of flesh meeting tons of\r\nflesh head on, shoulder on, or side on.\r\n\r\nShe saw bulls ripped beyond belief, with shoulders slashed as if by the\r\ndown strokes of a sword, yet still fighting as though untouched, with\r\nrumps raised and tails up and teeth in the necks of their enemies, one\r\nhad his eye torn out, yet tremendous and victorious he was literally\r\npunching his antagonist back into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe foam broke red and suddy; she saw that, just as she had seen the\r\nname of the _Albatross_ in the tremendous moment of the great ship's\r\neclipse, and, just as the name, the red breaking foam seemed to\r\nconcentrate in itself the whole terror of the business.\r\n\r\nThen, standing like a person helpless in a dream during the full hour\r\nthat the battle raged, she saw the females break bounds and spread over\r\nthe rocks carrying or pushing their young as if to get closer to the\r\nfight, and then she saw the battle beginning to break. Here and there\r\nbulls beaten and done for were taking to the sea and over all the beach\r\nthe fight had spread inwards towards the cliffs. The sea bulls were\r\nbeating the land bulls as a whole, interpenetrating them, getting closer\r\nto the females, herding the vanquished out.\r\n\r\nAnd she saw, now, as though a curtain had been raised, that the whole\r\ngreat battle was between individuals.\r\n\r\nThe bulls fresh from the sea though attacking _en masse_ were under the\r\ndominion of no enmity in common, each had come to find a rival and\r\nhaving found him had no eyes for anything else. Nor having once\r\nconquered did he pursue.\r\n\r\nAnother, and a wonderful thing, shewed up: the females had grouped\r\nthemselves as if to be taken, and now on the clearing beach could be\r\nseen family parties, some under the dominion of their new lords and\r\nmasters, some still being fought for.\r\n\r\nSo it hung, dwindling little by little till at last only two warriors\r\nwere left like the last-blazing point of the fight.\r\n\r\nThey were the biggest of the two herds; they looked as though they had\r\nbeen rolled in gore and they seemed equally furious and equally\r\nexhausted. All their rage was in their eyes. Too beaten to bite they\r\ncould only boost one against another like two schoolboys trying to push\r\none another off a form.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a miserable and tame ending of their tremendous struggle and\r\nshe recognized, or thought she recognized, that the biggest of them was\r\nthe bull who had followed her that day like a dog towards the river.\r\n\r\nThis shouldering and pushing was his last effort to hold to his wife and\r\nfamily. In war it is the last step that counts, could he make it? Then a\r\nstrange thing happened. The two monsters paused in their pushing,\r\nrelaxed, and seemed for a moment to forget the existence of one another.\r\nThat tremendous weariness lasted for a minute and then they woke up and\r\nthe biggest bull began to shuffle off to the sea.\r\n\r\nHis heart or his mind had failed him. The closer he got to the water's\r\nedge the swifter he moved and the plunge of his body into the water was\r\nthe last sound of that battle.\r\n\r\nNot a corpse lay on the beach, nothing but the victorious lords and\r\ntheir ladies, and the lords seemed to pay as little attention to their\r\nghastly wounds as they did to their old or newly got wives, who, now\r\nthat peace was restored, were busy suckling their young.\r\n\r\nA queer people, humorous and terrifying, making the girl feel that she\r\nhad placed her hand on something likeable, almost lovable, that had yet,\r\nof a sudden, nearly frightened her to death.\r\n\r\nShe sat recovering herself and helped by the regiment of penguins who\r\nmarched up to the seal beach and, knowing better than to attempt to\r\ncross it, stood bowing to the world in general and talking one to the\r\nother perhaps on the horrors of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTIME PASSES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not good to be alone. As the weeks passed she began to lose and\r\nforget the feeling of surety in rescue and at times, now, she found\r\nherself talking out loud, putting what was in her mind into speech as\r\nthough a companion were by, and sometimes she would hear a voice\r\nhallooing to her and start and cast her eyes over the desolate beach\r\nonly to see the gulls.\r\n\r\nThe beach was always haunted by queer noises; the chanting sound of the\r\nwaves coming in, a faint sound like the beating of a drum at very low\r\ntide, to say nothing of the booming of bitterns and the barking of brent\r\ngeese and the hundred voices of the wind. She would listen and listen,\r\nher mind wandering aimlessly, and in the great rains, when the whole sea\r\nwas shut out by the downpour, the noise would lull her like opium.\r\n\r\nThe baby sea elephants lost their long black coats and put on their\r\nsuits of fine yellow fur and took themselves to the nursery by the\r\nriver, where all day long they played and tumbled and swam, and then she\r\nwould sit and watch them like a mother watching her children.\r\n\r\nThe great battle of the bulls seemed like something far away beyond\r\nwhich other things were becoming vague. Something that was not meant to\r\nbe seen so close by human eyes, something that had pushed her still\r\nfurther from man.\r\n\r\nIt was full summer now, the season of tremendous sunsets and when the\r\nsky was clear, vast conflagrations lit themselves beyond the Lizard\r\nPoint painting the islands and purpling the skies, and one evening as\r\nshe sat in the western blaze watching the moving beach and listening to\r\nthe playing and quarrelling of the nursery a voice said to her:\r\n\r\n\"Some day all these will take to the sea and leave you. There will be\r\nnothing here but the rocks and the sea.\"\r\n\r\nIt was as though the sunset had spoken.\r\n\r\nThe thought aroused her as a knock on the door arouses a sleeper.\r\nFighting against it her mind became more fully awake. She said to\r\nherself: \"If they go I will go too.\"\r\n\r\nFor a long time now she had lived without hot food or drink. On coming\r\nhere first she had cut some wood from the figure-head to make a fire,\r\nbut it was damp, just damp enough to prevent it from kindling, so she\r\nhad let things go as women do in the matter of food when they have not\r\nany one else to feed; she had burrowed into the cache and got at some of\r\nthe tins of vegetables and on these and biscuits and tinned meat she\r\nmade out, eating less and less as time went on.\r\n\r\nIt is bad to be alone, even with sea elephants to ward off fears, even\r\nwith provisions enough for a year and a cave to shelter one.\r\n\r\nShe had never given in. She had fought the future and refused to be\r\nfrightened by it, she had worked for life and taken refuge in the\r\nmoment, and now the moment was taking its revenge for being too much\r\nlived in.\r\n\r\nTo eat was almost too much trouble and presently the seal nursery became\r\ntoo long a walk and the little sea elephants at play had lost their\r\npower to interest her. Sleep began to take the place of food and\r\nsometimes, and for no reason, she would weep like a child.\r\n\r\nThe food she ate sometimes seemed to poison her, bringing on vomiting\r\nand dysentery, and it poisoned her because her stomach failed to digest\r\nit.\r\n\r\nShe was being poisoned, poisoned by loneliness. Had her stomach not\r\nfailed her mind would have given, as it was the weakness of malnutrition\r\nsaved her reason as it slowly destroyed her hold on life.\r\n\r\nHer dreams became sometimes more vivid than reality and they always held\r\nher to the beach where she watched without terror battles between\r\nmonstrous sea elephants and processions of penguins infinite in length,\r\npenguins that passed her bowing, bowing, bowing till she woke in the\r\ndark with the palms of her hands dry and burning and her lips like\r\npumice stone and her tongue feeling hard like the tongue of a parrot,\r\nbut the worst experience of all was a shock that came nearly every time\r\nshe lay down at night and just before sleep took her.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like the blow of a fist, a fist that hit her everywhere,\r\nmaking her start and draw up her legs and cry out.\r\n\r\nAll this, perhaps, was what she had foreseen when long ago she had\r\nwatched a great ship that had told her of Desolation--and something\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nThis was what no one had ever imagined in connection with Desolation.\r\nIts power to kill with its own hand. To gently destroy, sucking the\r\nvitality like a vampire and fanning the victim to dullness with its\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nThe sea elephants might have noticed that the female creature to whom\r\nthey had grown so accustomed appeared little now, a shrinking vision\r\nthat every day shortened its wanderings; that it walked differently,\r\nthat it seemed more bent. But the sea elephants knew nothing of\r\nLoneliness or its works, nor did they notice, one morning, that though\r\nthe sun was shining the figure did not appear at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nA NEWCOMER\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, brilliant, with the deceptive brilliancy of Kerguelen, a\r\nbig man, rough and red-bearded and carrying a bundle slung over his\r\nshoulder, stood on the rocks that formed the eastern point of the great\r\nbeach; the sun was at his back and before him lay the seven mile stretch\r\nof sand and rock leading to the far-off Lizard Point.\r\n\r\nHe was over six feet in height but so strongly built that he scarcely\r\nlooked his inches. He was a sailor. The gulls might have told that by\r\nthe way he stood, and his eyes, accustomed to roving over vast spaces,\r\nswept the beach before him from end to end, took in the sea elephants\r\nmoving like slugs and the seal-nursery and the river and the sands\r\nbeyond and the Lizard Point crawling out to sea beyond the sands.\r\n\r\nThen he cast his eyes inland.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to get to the west and he had to choose between seven miles of\r\nbroken country or seven miles of easy beach.\r\n\r\nThe sea elephants were a bar across the beach. He could gauge their size\r\nfrom where he stood, they looked formidable, but they were less so than\r\nthe rocks strewing that broken country. He had climbed over rocks and\r\ngone round rocks and nearly fallen from rocks till rocks had become in\r\nhis mind enemies bitter, brutal, callous, and far more formidable than\r\nlive things. He chose the beach and came down to it, taking his way\r\nalong the sea edge as a person takes his way along a pavement edge,\r\ngiving possibly turbulent people the wall.\r\n\r\nAs he closed up towards the seal beach he kept his eyes fixed on the\r\ngreat bulls and their families, and the bulls, as he drew closer,\r\nshifted their position to watch him, beyond that they shewed no sign.\r\nThen as he began to pass them he recognised that he had nothing to fear,\r\nthe females alone, here and there, shewed any sign of disturbance,\r\nshuffling towards him with wicked eyes, rising on their flippers, but\r\nalways sinking down and shuffling back as he went on.\r\n\r\nFurther along, though followed and met by a hundred pairs of eyes, even\r\nthe females began to treat him with indifference. It was as though the\r\nwhole herd were under the dominion of one brain that recognized him as\r\nharmless and passed him along. He would pause now and then to look at\r\nthem with the admiration of strength for strength. He was of their type,\r\na bull man, rough from the sea as themselves.\r\n\r\nThen he saw the caves and would have passed them only for something that\r\ncaught his eye. A red labelled Libby tin was lying on the dark sand\r\nclose to the mouth of one of the caves, and if you wish to know how an\r\nold tomato tin or an old beef tin can shout, you must go alone to the\r\ngreat beach of Kerguelen and find one there--which you will not.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the tin made him start and catch in his breath. The tin was\r\neverything he knew of ships and men focussed in a point, a knight in\r\narmour riding along the beach would have astonished him no more, would\r\nhave heated his blood far less.\r\n\r\nHe struck up towards it, took it in his hand, examined it inside and out\r\nand then cast his eye at the cave before which it had lain. He saw\r\nsomething in the cave, it was a woman; a woman lying on the sand with a\r\nrolled-up blanket under her head. She was lying on her back and he saw a\r\nthin white hand, so small, so thin, so strange that he drew slightly\r\nback, glanced over his shoulder, as if to make sure that everything was\r\nall right with the world, and then glanced again, drawing closer.\r\n\r\nThen he called out and the woman moved. He could see her face now,\r\nwhite, and thin and drawn, and great eyes, terrible eyes, fixed on him.\r\n\r\nAway out at sea, terribly near the coast of Death she saw him, a living\r\nbeing, as the castaway sees a ship on the far horizon.\r\n\r\nHe saw her hold out her arms to him and then, throwing his bundle aside,\r\nhe was down on his knees beside her, holding the hands that sought his\r\nand with those terrible eyes holding him too.\r\n\r\nHe saw her lips moving, saw that they were dry and parched. Then he\r\nknew. She wanted water.\r\n\r\nAn empty baling tin was lying near her. The sight of the river close by\r\nwas in his mind, he released the hands, picked up the tin and scrambled\r\nout of the cave. As he ran to the river heedless of sea elephants or\r\nanything else he kept crying out: \"Oh, the poor woman. Oh, the poor\r\nwoman.\" He seemed like a huge thing demented. The baby sea elephants\r\nscuttered out of his way and as he came running back he spilt half the\r\ncontents of the tin. Then he was down beside her again, dipping his\r\nfinger in the water and moistening her lips.\r\n\r\nShe sucked his finger as a baby sucks and the feel of that made him\r\ncurse with the tears running down into his beard. The size of the baling\r\ntin seemed horrible beyond words; he couldn't get it to her lips. Still\r\nhe went on, not knowing that it was his finger that was giving her back\r\nlife; the blessed touch of a human being that had come almost too late.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting on his heels, and now, casting his great head from side\r\nto side, he saw things stacked behind her, tins and a bag and metal\r\nthings that shone dimly. Putting out his hand he caught a corner of the\r\nbag. It was a bread bag, sure enough, and as he pulled it towards him\r\nthe other things came clattering down almost hitting her, and amongst\r\nthem, God-sent, a little tin spoon.\r\n\r\nHe seized it and filled it and brought the tip to her lips and she\r\nswallowed the water making movements with her throat muscles as though\r\nit were half a cupful. He did this a dozen times and then rested, spoon\r\nin hand, watching her. She made a couple of slight movements with her\r\nhead as if nodding to him and her eyes never left him for a moment, they\r\nseemed holding on to life through him. He offered a spoonful of water\r\nagain, she moved her head slightly as though she had had enough, but her\r\neyes never left him.\r\n\r\nHe knew. If the whole thing had been carefully explained to him he could\r\nnot have known better how she was clinging to him, as a child to a\r\nmother, as a creature to life. And all the time his rough mind in a\r\ntumble of confusion and trouble was trying to think how she came like\r\nthis, with a bread bag close to her and a river within reach.\r\n\r\nA tin cup had come down with the other things, it gave him an idea, and\r\ngetting a biscuit out of the bag he broke it up, put the pieces in the\r\ncup with some water and let them soak. It took a long time and all the\r\nwhile, now and then, he kept talking to her.\r\n\r\n\"There. Y'aren't so bad after all--keep up till I get you something\r\nmore. There's no use in troubling--you'll be on your pins soon.\"\r\n\r\nHe would pause to swear at the biscuit for not softening quicker,\r\nhelping it to crumble with his mighty thumb thrust in the cup. To \"get\r\nfood into her\" was his main idea, it didn't matter about thumbs. He was\r\nnot without experience of starvation and thirst and what they can do to\r\npeople, and, as he worked away talking to her, pictures from the past\r\ncame to him of people he had seen like this, nearly \"done in\" by the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThen he began to feed her with the noxious pap. He managed to get six\r\nspoonfuls \"into her\" and then he saw she would stand no more; still,\r\nthat was something, and as he brooded on his heels watching her he saw\r\nthat she was making a struggle to keep it down, and he knew that if she\r\nbrought it up she was done for. And all the time she kept holding him\r\nwith her eyes as though he were helping her in the struggle.\r\n\r\nHe was. The sight of him gave her just the strength necessary to tide\r\nover the danger point; then she lay still and the food, such as it was,\r\nbegan to do its work.\r\n\r\nOne may say that the stomach thinks; every mood of the mind can touch it\r\nand it can influence every mood of the mind.\r\n\r\nThen the terrible fixed eyes began to grow more human, then to close\r\nslightly. She was still far at sea, but no longer adrift; like a little\r\nboat taken in tow she was heading now back for the shore. She fell\r\nasleep holding his thumb.\r\n\r\nThe bits of wood she had chipped from the figure-head were lying in a\r\nlittle heap near the cave mouth and the axe lay beside them. He noted\r\nthem as he sat motionless as a carved figure till the grip on his thumb\r\nrelaxed, and the dry claw-like hand, now growing moist and human, gave\r\nup its hold.\r\n\r\nThen, crawling out, stealthily and side-ways like a crab, he seized the\r\naxe and, rising up outside, axe in hand, stood looking in at the woman.\r\nHe stood watching her, making sure that she was well asleep, then he\r\nturned towards the seal nursery swinging the axe. There he murdered a\r\nlittle girl sea elephant after a short, sharp chase over the rocks.\r\nThen, close to the caves and with his sailor's knife, he stripped her of\r\nfur and blubber. He placed the blubber on one side, cut up the meat and\r\nretaining the heart and kidneys wrapped the head and the remainders in\r\nthe pelt and dumped them in a crack in the rocks.\r\n\r\nHaving done this he went to the river and washed his hands free of the\r\nblood and grease.\r\n\r\nIn his bundle there was a box with half a dozen matches, they would have\r\nbeen gone long ago only that long ago his tobacco had given out. They\r\nwere useful now.\r\n\r\nHe knelt down and undid the bundle. There was in it beside the match-box\r\na shirt rolled up, two sailors' knives, two tobacco boxes, a couple of\r\nhuge biscuits, a piece of sail cloth and a pair of men's boots, one\r\nmight have fancied from the knives and tobacco boxes that he was the\r\nonly survivor of a party of three cast on the coast and that he had kept\r\nthese things as relics. That was the fact.\r\n\r\nWhen he had secured the matches his next thought was of the firewood and\r\nthe baling tin. There was a saucepan away at the back of the cave under\r\nthe other things but he could not see it. He could see the tin but he\r\ndreaded going in to get it lest he should wake the woman and she should\r\nclutch his thumb again.\r\n\r\nThat was a bad experience and he told himself that if she had not\r\nrelaxed her hold he would have been sitting there still tied hand and\r\nfoot and not daring to move--strength in the clutch of weakness, to whom\r\nGod has given a power greater that that of strength.\r\n\r\nHe crawled in and secured the tin without wakening her and as much\r\nfirewood as he wanted. It was fairly dry and with the help of the\r\nblubber he soon had it burning between two big stones, then he put the\r\ntin on, half filled with water, and dropped in the seal meat cut fine.\r\nHe was making soup for himself as well as for her. He had been without\r\nhot food for ages and the smell of the stuff as it began to cook made\r\nhim sometimes forget her entirely.\r\n\r\nPredatory gulls had found the pelt and the head in the rock crevice and\r\ntheir quarrelling filled the beach. He turned his head sometimes to look\r\nat them as he sat squatting like a gipsy before the little fire, tilting\r\nthe tin by the handle and stirring the contents with his knife. He was a\r\nman of resource for, before filling the tin with fresh water, he had\r\ndipped it in the sea so as to get some salt into the mess.\r\n\r\nThen when the stuff was cooked, having no spoon, he had to wait until it\r\ncooled a bit before tasting it. He went to the cave mouth to have a\r\nlook at the woman. The quarrelling of the great gulls had evidently\r\nawakened her, for her eyes were open, and as his figure cut the light at\r\nthe cave entrance her head moved. He ran back for the precious tin and,\r\ncarrying it carefully, and half carried away by the entrancing smell of\r\nit, knelt down beside her, then picking up the spoon began to feed her\r\nbefore feeding himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took him three days to bring her back safe to life. It poured with\r\nrain during those three days but he managed to light little fires in one\r\nof the caves with seal blubber and routing out the things in her cave he\r\nfound everything she had so carefully salved, the cups and plates, the\r\ntin of coffee, half empty now--everything, even to the tobacco the men\r\nhad taken from the cache, he found Bompard's tinder-box and the Swedish\r\nmatch box belonging to La Touche. He had given the woman life and she\r\nhad given him tobacco and sometimes, sitting in the adjoining cave and\r\nsmoking between nursing times, he would bring his big fist down on his\r\nthigh, just that.\r\n\r\nHere was a woman starving to death and dying of thirst with food enough\r\nfor a ship's company at her elbow. And the tobacco! Where was the\r\nexplanation? She was able to speak a little now. She had spoken at first\r\nin French, which he could not understand, then she spoke in English as\r\ngood as his; another mystery. A woman all gone to pieces that spoke two\r\ntongues and was different somehow from any woman he had ever known.\r\n\r\nThen the things she had said: \"Who are you? I am not dreaming this? Are\r\nyou really, really, truly--Oh, _don't_ leave me.\" Crazy talk like that.\r\nAnd it was always \"Oh, don't leave me.\" Then he would lay his pipe down\r\ncarefully on the sand of the cave and pass through the sheeting rain to\r\nhave a look at her. Sometimes she would have dozed off and he could get\r\nback to his pipe, sometimes she was awake and then he would have to sit\r\ndown beside her and hold her hand and stroke it or play with her fingers\r\njust as one plays with the fingers of a child. At these moments he was\r\ntransformed, he was no longer a man, he was a mother, and the hand that\r\ncould break down the resistance of a bellying sail was the hand of a\r\nchild. He no longer thought of her as the \"poor woman,\" an infant is\r\nsexless, so did she seem, or so would she have seemed had he thought of\r\nthe matter. He didn't. As a matter of fact thought was not his strong\r\nsuit in the game of life. He was a man from the world of Things. That\r\nwas why, perhaps, he made such a good sick nurse. He did not fuss, nor\r\ntalk, his touch was firm, firm as his determination to \"get food into\r\nher\" and his hand, big as a ham, was delicate because it was the hand of\r\na perfect steersman. It was used to handling women in the form of three\r\nthousand ton ships, coaxing them, humouring them--up to a point.\r\n\r\nHe fed her now from one of the tin cups. Every two hours of the day,\r\nunless she was asleep, half a cupful of food went into her whether she\r\nliked it or not; \"hot stuff,\" for though the firewood was done he found\r\nthat the blubber alone was the best fuel in the world.\r\n\r\nOn the second day she was able to raise herself up, and once when he\r\ncame in he found that she had been moving about the cave and that she\r\nhad rearranged the blanket that did for a pillow.\r\n\r\nThen on the morning when the blessed sun shone she was able to come out\r\nand sit on a patch of sand with one of the blankets for a rug.\r\n\r\nShe looked old and worn, but no longer terrible, and as she sat with her\r\nthin hands folded in her lap watching the great sea bulls and the cows,\r\nas if contemplating them for the first time, the man who had helped her\r\nout and placed her there was at a loss--she was a sight to inspire pity\r\nin a savage. He took his seat beside her on a piece of rock and rolling\r\nsome tobacco in his hand stuffed his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"You're all right now,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe nodded her head and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"this is good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky I came along,\" he said, \"wouldn't have seen you only an old tin\r\nhit my eye.\"\r\n\r\nHe put the pipe in his pocket, got up, went to the cave where he did the\r\ncooking and came back with a cup half full of coffee and half a biscuit.\r\n\r\n\"Dip it in,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe did as she was bid. It was the first time he had given her coffee\r\nand the stimulant brought a flush to her cheeks and cheered her heart\r\nso that she began to talk.\r\n\r\n\"There are more biscuits in a place down the beach,\" she said, \"and down\r\nthere,\" she nodded to the left, \"there are a lot of things hidden under\r\na heap of stones. It's beyond the river on the left.\"\r\n\r\nThen the empty cup began to shake in her hand and he took it from her.\r\n\r\n\"You're not over strong yet,\" said he, \"but you'll be better in a bit\r\nwith this sun. Y'aren't afraid of the sea cows, are you?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you wouldn't be,\" said he, \"there's no harm in them. Well, I'll\r\nbe moving about. I'll go and have a look down the beach and see what's\r\nto be found.\"\r\n\r\nHe hung for a moment with the cup in his hand shading his eyes and\r\nlooking seaward, then he turned towards the cave to put the cup back.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" she said, suddenly, bringing him to a halt.\r\n\r\n\"Raft,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Raft,\" she repeated the name several times in a low voice as if\r\ncommitting it to memory or turning it over in her mind.\r\n\r\n\"How long might you have been here?\" he asked, standing in a doubtful\r\nmanner, as though debating in his mind the wisdom of allowing her to\r\nstrain her strength answering questions.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said she, \"a long while. I was wrecked with two men from\r\na yacht. The _Gaston de Paris_. We came here in a boat. They are both\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nAt the name _Gaston de Paris_ Raft nodded his head. Already a suspicion\r\nthat she might be one of the yacht's crowd had come into his mind, so\r\nthe news came scarcely as a surprise.\r\n\r\n\"It was us you hit,\" said he, \"I'm one of the chaps from the old\r\nhooker.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Albatross_?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's her.\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing for a moment, looking away over at the islands. She\r\ncould see the name, still, written as if on the night. Then she\r\nremembered the boat sail she had seen when adrift with Bompard and La\r\nTouche.\r\n\r\n\"There were four of us got off,\" said he, \"we struck them islands over\r\nthere and put in but there was nothing but rocks in that part. Next day\r\nwe put out, but got blown down the coast; we got smashed landing; all\r\nbut a chap named Ponting and me went under, but one chap's body was hove\r\nup and we stripped him. I've got his boots and his knife in that bundle\r\nover there in the cave, and Ponting's. We saved a bag of bread.\"\r\n\r\nHe took his seat again on the rock and, placing the cup beside him, took\r\nthe pipe from his pocket, but he did not light it. He held it, rubbing\r\nthe bowl reflectively. He seemed to have come to an end of his story.\r\n\r\n\"Did the other man die?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"He went getting gulls' eggs one day,\" said Raft, \"and slipped over the\r\ncliff. They're big, the cliffs, down there. I found him all broke up on\r\nthe rocks. He didn't live more than a minute when I got to him and I had\r\nto leave him; the tide was coming up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor man,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHe rose up and, taking the cup, stood for a moment again looking\r\nseaward.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll be off down the beach,\" said he, \"you won't be frightened to\r\nbe here by yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied, \"but don't go very far.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep in sight,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\nHe put the cup in the cave and off he went whilst she sat watching him;\r\neverything, life itself, seemed centred in him. A terrible feeling came\r\nover her at moments that he might vanish, that, looking away for a\r\nmoment and turning again she might find him gone and nothing but the\r\nbeach and the gulls.\r\n\r\nBeyond the river he turned and saw her watching him and waved his hand\r\nas if to reassure her. She waved in reply and then sat watching till he\r\nreached the figure-head and stood to examine it.\r\n\r\nHe seemed very small from here. She saw him standing and looking inland,\r\nhe had seen the cache, no doubt, and he would want to go to it; if he\r\ndid that he would disappear from sight. But he did not go to it, he kept\r\non always in view, exploring the rocks and the sands and stopping now\r\nand then as if to look back.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that he could read her mind and feel her terror of\r\nbeing left alone. Then her mind went back over the last few days.\r\n\r\nShe had been very near death. She had drunk the last of the water in the\r\ntin and had been too feeble to go for more. What had brought her to that\r\npass? It seemed to her that the rocks, the sea and the sky had slowly\r\nsucked her vitality away from her till at last she could not eat, could\r\nnot walk, could not think. All that time her mind had never thought of\r\nloneliness, the thing that was killing her had veiled itself by numbing\r\nher brain and weakening her body. But near death her mind had cleared\r\nand the great grief of desolation stood before her. Then God-sent, a\r\nform had pushed the grief aside and a hand had taken her lonely hand and\r\na finger had moistened her lips. But it was the knowledge that the hand\r\nwas a real hand that gave her the first lead back to life.\r\n\r\nThen the last three days. The feeling of extreme helplessness and\r\nsickness and the knowledge that she was watched over and cared for and\r\nthought for--there was no word to express what all that meant. It turned\r\nthe great rough figure to a spirit, great and tender and benign.\r\n\r\nHe was coming along back now carrying something he had picked up amongst\r\nthe rocks. It was a crab.\r\n\r\nA great satisfactory two pound crab bound up in kelp ribbon so craftily\r\nthat it could neither bite nor escape. He put it on the sand for her to\r\nlook at before taking it off to boil.\r\n\r\nThe sun was hot and as he stood whilst she admired his prize: \"Don't you\r\nfeel the sun to your head?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied, \"I like it. I had a hat--a sou'wester but it's in a\r\ncave away down the beach. There's a dead man there.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dead man?\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I killed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Killed him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was partly accident. He was one of the sailors. He was a bad man.\r\nThe other sailor got lost and never came back and I was left alone with\r\nthis man. He nearly frightened me to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swab,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"Then one night he crawled into my cave in the dark and I struck out\r\nwith the knife and it killed him--he's lying there now. I didn't mean to\r\nkill him, but he frightened me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swab,\" said Raft, two tones deeper. Then he laughed as if to himself.\r\n\"Well, that's a go,\" said he. He took a pull at his beard as he\r\ncontemplated this slayer of men seated on her blankets at his feet. She\r\nglanced up and saw that he was laughing and a wan smile came around her\r\neyes, it seemed to him like a glimmer of sunshine from inside of her.\r\nThen bending down he pulled up the blanket that had slipped from her\r\nleft shoulder and settled it in its place.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you all about it some time,\" said she, \"when I feel\r\nstronger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Raft. Then he went off with the crab to boil it.\r\n\r\nAs he attended to this business in the cave, half-sitting, half-kneeling\r\nbefore the little fire, he chuckled to himself now and then, and now and\r\nthen he would bring his great hand down on his thigh with a slap.\r\n\r\nThe idea of her killing a man seemed to him the height of humour. He\r\ndidn't put much store on men's lives in general, and none at all on the\r\nlife of an unknown swab who deserved his gruel. Then he was of the type\r\nthat admires a fighting thing much more than a peaceful and placid\r\nthing, and he felt the pleasure of a man who has rescued a seemingly\r\nweak and inoffensive creature only to find that it has pluck and teeth\r\nof its own.\r\n\r\nShe had gone up a lot in his estimation. Besides, her feebleness and\r\nforlorn condition had wounded him in a great soft part of his nature\r\nwhere the hurt felt queer. This new knowledge somehow eased the hurt. He\r\ncould think of her now apart from her condition and think more kindly of\r\nher, for the strange fact remains that the very weakness and forlornness\r\nthat had wakened his boundless compassion had antagonized him. When he\r\nhad found the crab the idea had come to him that here was some different\r\nsort of food to \"put into her;\" he was thinking that same thought now\r\nbut with more enthusiasm. Yes, she had gone up a lot in his estimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nA DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\nThis same Raft whom the fo'c'sle could subdue to the surroundings,\r\nmaking him as faithful a part of the picture as the kerosene lamp, on\r\nthe beach stood immense both in size and significance.\r\n\r\nIt was as though the fo'c'sle had the power to dwindle him, the beach,\r\nto expand him.\r\n\r\nThe girl had never seen him in the fo'c'sle so she could not appreciate\r\nthe difference that environment made in him, and perhaps she saw him\r\never so slightly magnified, but it seemed to her that he was big enough\r\nto form part of the landscape, that he was one with the seven mile beach\r\nand the Lizard Point and the great islands and the sea elephants.\r\n\r\nNot only had she been crushed down by loneliness; size had helped. Raft\r\nseemed to reduce the size of things, so that the seven mile strand and\r\nthe vast islands and sea spaces no longer burdened her, and in some\r\nmagical way whilst he reduced the proportions of his surroundings they\r\nincreased his potency and significance. He was in his true setting, part\r\nof a vast picture without a frame.\r\n\r\nIt was not alone his physical dimensions. Bompard had been a big man,\r\nbut Bompard could not fill that beach. No, it was something else--what\r\nwe call, for want of a better expression, \"the man himself.\"\r\n\r\nThen there was another thing about him, he found food of all sorts where\r\nBompard and La Touche had found nothing; he brought in crabs and\r\ncray-fish and penguins eggs, he brought down rabbits with stones. That\r\nwas his great art. A stone in the hand of Raft was a terrible missile\r\nand his aim was deadly.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a week the girl was able to accompany him along the beach\r\nto the cache where he unearthed some stores and came upon the harpoon\r\nwhich he carried back with them.\r\n\r\nThen one day he suddenly appeared before her carrying her lost\r\nsou'wester. He had gone off down the beach in the direction of the\r\nLizard Point and he came back carrying the hat in his hand. He must have\r\nbeen into the cave where the remains of La Touche lay, but he said\r\nnothing about that.\r\n\r\nIt was nearly a fortnight since she had told him of how she had lost it\r\nand he must have treasured the fact up in his mind all that time.\r\n\r\nThe weather had cleared again, after a tremendous blow from the south,\r\nand as they sat that evening in the sunset blaze before the caves, Raft,\r\nwho had been staring steadfastly out to sea as if watching something,\r\nbegan to talk.\r\n\r\n\"That chap Ponting told me this side of the coast is no use for ships,\"\r\nsaid he. \"They keep beyond them islands for fear of the reefs. I reckon\r\nthe old sea cows know that or there wouldn't be so many on this beach.\r\nHe said there was a bay round to the westward where ships put in.\"\r\n\r\n\"How far?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"A goodish bit,\" replied Raft. \"I was making for that bay when I struck\r\nyou. I was thinking,\" he finished, \"that when you were stronger on your\r\npins we might make for there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Raft, \"there's not much use sticking here.\"\r\n\r\nShe said nothing for a moment, she felt disturbed.\r\n\r\nSince her recovery she had fallen into a state of quietude. She who had\r\nbeen the leader of Bompard and La Touche, she who had fought and worked\r\nso determinedly for existence had now no ambition, no desire for\r\nanything but rest. The strength of this man who had given her back her\r\nlife seemed a shield against everything, just as a wall is a shield\r\nagainst the wind; she was content to sit in its shelter and rest. The\r\nidea of new exertions and unknown places terrified her.\r\n\r\n\"But how are you to know the bay?\" asked she, \"there may be a good many\r\nbays along the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Raft, \"Ponting told me there wasn't a decent anchorage but\r\nthis. He said this bay wasn't to be mistook, looks as if it was cut out\r\nwith a spade and the cliffs run high and black, there's a seal beach\r\nthat way and it's after seals the ships come. Well, there's time enough\r\nto think of it seeing you are not fit to move yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'll soon be all right,\" said she. \"I'm getting stronger every\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"What gets me,\" said Raft, \"is how you fell to pieces like that, with\r\nall that stuff at your elbow and a river close by.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was being alone,\" replied she, \"I did not know it at the time, but I\r\ngot so that I did not care to eat and then at last I believe I didn't\r\neat anything at all. I couldn't have imagined that just being alone\r\nwould make a person like that. You see I had food and water. If I had\r\nbeen compelled to hunt about for food I expect I would have been all\r\nright, as it was I had nothing to do and was just driven in on myself.\"\r\n\r\nRaft said nothing for a moment, he was turning this over in his mind. He\r\ncould not understand it. The idea of a person with plenty of food and a\r\ngood set of teeth dying of starvation just because she was lonely seemed\r\nto him outrageous, yet he knew she was speaking the truth. It was\r\nanother strange thing about this strange woman. She was altogether\r\nstrange, different from any human being he had ever met and growing more\r\ndifferent every day now that she was \"filling out,\" and getting her\r\nvoice back.\r\n\r\nThat voice, soft and musical and refined, had disturbed the sea\r\nelephants when she first talked to them as people talk to horses and\r\ndogs, it was something they had never heard before in the language of\r\ntone, and so it was with this sea animal with a red beard. He could not\r\ntell whether he liked it or not, never asked himself the question, it\r\nwas part of her general strangeness and to be considered along with her\r\nclinging, man killing and double-tongued qualities, also with the fact\r\nthat she had starved almost to death because she was alone; also with\r\nher eyes and new face, for she was growing younger looking every day and\r\nbetter looking, and her eyes, naturally lovely, were growing natural\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs he looked at her now sitting in the sunset this return of beauty\r\nstruck him as it almost might have struck the sea elephants. It pleased\r\nhim. Had he put his thoughts into words he would have said that she was\r\nfilling out and getting more pleasant looking. At her very best he would\r\nnever have tacked the word beauty on to her; a buxom, rotund, beady-eyed\r\nyoung female would have made the word beauty spring to his lips--Cléo\r\nde Bromsart, never. But she was getting more pleasant looking and her\r\neyes were getting over their \"stiffness\"--which was something, and he\r\nfelt pleased.\r\n\r\nPresently, alone in his cave, he would bring his fist down on his thigh\r\nwith a bang and chuckle over her contrarieties, reviewing her against\r\nthat terrific picture he had seen in the cave when he had gone to fetch\r\nthe sou'wester; the picture of a man who had been torn to pieces by\r\nBurgomasters and cormorants. It had been necessary to wash the\r\nsou'wester for a long time in sea water before bringing it back.\r\n\r\nShe had done that chap in proper; the work of the gulls and the work of\r\nthe girl were hardly dissociated in his mind--there was the Result. Just\r\nas though a baby had smashed a rock with its fist. Hence the chuckles,\r\nheightened by her clinging ways, her fragility, her musical voice, her\r\nstarvation due to loneliness, her double tongue, her unaccountable\r\ntricks of manner.\r\n\r\nAnd she, as she sat in the sunset not knowing his thoughts, had you\r\nasked her how she felt about him would have answered with steadfast eyes\r\nthat she loved him. Meaning that she loved him as she had learned to\r\nlove the sea-elephants, or as she would have loved a great carthorse\r\nthat had stood between her and danger, or a huge dog. She scarcely\r\nthought of him as a man--just as a great benign thing, human, but nearer\r\nto the heart than any human being life had brought her in contact with\r\ntill now.\r\n\r\nHer almost passionate gratitude had little to do with this measure of\r\nhim; any kindly man might have done what he had done. It was perhaps the\r\nfeeling of his great strength, of his possible fierceness that gave the\r\ntouch of benignity to him.\r\n\r\n\"Weren't you afraid of them sea cows?\" said he at last, \"you must have\r\ncome clean through them to get to that cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she replied, \"I didn't mind them, quite the reverse. I came here\r\nbecause of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They were company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning--\"\r\n\r\n\"Friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Y'mean to say--friends did you call them? Well, I don't know, there's\r\nno accountin'.\"\r\n\r\nHe hung in irons. So she had been keeping company with the sea cows--and\r\nshe talked of them as \"friends.\"\r\n\r\nNow Raft, for all his limitless power of compassion for a female in\r\ndistress would have slaughtered those same \"sea-cows\" to the last bull,\r\nand without a shred of compunction or compassion, had he possessed\r\nkettles to boil down the blubber and a vessel to carry the oil. He had\r\nalready done in two of the babies for food when she was not looking. The\r\nidea of talking about them as friends tickled his mind in a new place.\r\nThen, as he glanced at the great bulls taking headers in the sunset\r\nlight and snorting in from the sea and squatting over the beach, he came\r\nas near as anything to bursting into a roar of laughter.\r\n\r\nThen he suddenly remembered supper and went off to prepare it.\r\n\r\nThe girl, left to herself, smiled. He had given her back that power and,\r\nlike the sea elephants when they repulsed the penguins, he had given her\r\nsomething to smile over. She saw that he could not understand her in the\r\nleast in a lot of little things, whilst she understood him through and\r\nthrough--or so she thought. She had thought the same about the sea\r\nelephants till the great battle, and--she had never seen Raft with\r\nmurder in his eyes making the elements of beef tea.\r\n\r\nHe had made a stew for supper out of mussels, canned vegetables, seal\r\nmeat and a piece of rabbit and when supper was over she went to bed in\r\nthe bed he had made for her, for he had stripped the cache of all its\r\nwearing apparel and the remaining blankets, reserving the blankets for\r\nher use.\r\n\r\nThen as she lay awake before dropping off to sleep she heard a sudden\r\nburst of noise from the night outside. It sounded as though one of the\r\nbulls had suddenly perceived a joke and were giving vent to his\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nShe knew what it was, and she guessed the joke, and then, lying there in\r\nthe dark, she began to laugh softly to herself with laughter that seemed\r\nto ease her mind of some old incubus clinging to it--less laughter than\r\na sort of inverted form of crying and ending up almost in the latter\r\nwith a few sniffs.\r\n\r\nThen she fell asleep and dreamed that Raft had turned into something\r\nthat seemed like a sea lion. She had never seen a sea lion, but this\r\ndream--one looked something like a lion and something like a sea\r\nelephant and something like Raft--with a touch of a carthorse. It had\r\nflippers, then it had wings, and the setting was the Place de la\r\nConcorde which bordered quite naturally the great beach of Kerguelen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nSTORIES ON THE BEACH\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a week after that day not a word was said about their departure for\r\nthat problematical bay to the westward where ships put in, or where they\r\nmight put in should they find themselves in the region of Kerguelen. The\r\nidea seemed to the girl like one of those nightmare ideas, those\r\nterrific tasks which fever or indigestion sets to one in dreams.\r\n\r\nIt blew during that week as it had never blown before; blew from the\r\nnorth and the south and the west Atlantic oceans of rain driving\r\nseawards from the hills and passing off towards the islands, followed by\r\nbreaks of clear weather and blue sparkling skies filled with the tearing\r\nscreaming wind.\r\n\r\nThey talked a good deal during these days and at odd times, and the girl\r\nbegan to get some true glimpses of the mind of her companion, a mind\r\nthat had never grown up, yet had in no wise deteriorated from remaining\r\nungrown. Raft, who had been round the world a dozen times and more, knew\r\nless of the world than a modern child. Fights and roaring drunks and the\r\nsmoke haze of bar rooms, wharf Messalinas and sailors' lodging houses\r\nhad done him no harm at all. His innocence was vast and indestructible\r\nas his ignorance.\r\n\r\nBompard and La Touche were old men of the world compared to Raft; they\r\nwere of different stuff, and being yachtsmen they had been long rubbed\r\nagainst the ways of high civilization.\r\n\r\nTo the girl, born and bred amongst all the intricacies of modern life\r\nand thought, and with a sense of mind-values as delicate as a jeweller's\r\nscales, Raft was a revelation.\r\n\r\nShe tried to sound his past. He had no past beyond the _Albatross_. He\r\ncould tell all about the _Albatross_ and his shipmates and the Old Man\r\nand so forth, but beyond that lay only a ship called the _Pathfinder_,\r\nand beyond that a muddle of ships and ports, a forest of masts\r\nstretching to a grey time an infinite distance away, the time of his\r\nchildhood. He had no professed religion and he could neither read nor\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nYet he had remembered her sou'wester, this man without a memory and he\r\nwas always astonishing her by remembering little things she had said or\r\nthings she had wished for.\r\n\r\nOf social distinction, beyond the division of afterguard from fo'c'sle,\r\nhe seemed to possess little idea, save for a vague echo, caught from the\r\nman Harbutt, about the Rich People; and as to sex, beyond a queer\r\ninstinctive delicacy and a tenderness due to her weakness and the memory\r\nof how he had found her, she might just as well have been a man, or a\r\nchild like himself.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that struck her forcibly was the sense of his good humour.\r\nHis mind seemed to possess an equable warm temperature, a temperature\r\nthat it seemed impossible to lower or raise. She could not fancy him\r\ngetting angry about anything. Had she seen him as in the past during one\r\nof his rare sprees, fighting the crowd and tossing men about like\r\nninepins, she would have said: 'This is not the same man'--and maybe she\r\nwould have been right.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you come from,\" said he one day to her as they sat rain-bound\r\nwatching the gulls dashing about over the crests of the incoming seas.\r\n\r\n\"I came from Paris--you have never been to Paris?\"\r\n\r\nNo, he had never been to Paris. He knew of the place, it was in France.\r\nThen she thought that she would interest him by trying to describe it.\r\nShe spoke of the busy streets and the great Boulevards, then she tried\r\nto describe the people and what they were doing and then, as she talked,\r\nit was just as though Kerguelen had become the big end of a telescope\r\nand the doings of civilisation, as exemplified by Paris, a panorama seen\r\nat the little end.\r\n\r\nWhat _were_ they all doing, those crowds that she could visualize so\r\nplainly?--deputies, lawyers, military men, shop-keepers, pleasure\r\nseekers--towards what end were they going?\r\n\r\nThen, with a strange little shock, it came to her that they were going,\r\nas a mass, nowhere except from dawn to dusk and dusk to dawn; that they\r\nwere exactly like the crowd of sea gulls, each individual rotating in\r\nits own little orbit, and that the wonderful coloured and spangled crust\r\ncalled Civilization was nothing more than the excretion of individual\r\nambitions, desires and energies.\r\n\r\nThen, when she had finished her talk about the wonderful city of Paris,\r\nshe found that Raft, comfortably propped against the cave wall, was\r\nasleep.\r\n\r\nOne of the disconcerting things about this huge creature was his\r\ncapacity for sleep. He would drop asleep like a dog at the shortest\r\nnotice and lie with his face in the crook of his arm like a dead man.\r\nShe would watch him sometimes for half an hour together as he lay like\r\nthis, and at first the vague fear used to come to her that he had been\r\nstricken by some malady in the form of sleeping sickness that made him\r\nact like this. She did not know that he had kept awake all those nights\r\nhe had looked after her and that the same brain that could sleep and\r\nsleep and sleep could put sleep entirely away, just as the great body\r\nthat lolled about like the sea elephants, could, like the sea-elephants,\r\nbecome a thing, tireless, and capable of infinite endurance.\r\n\r\nThen again, he would smoke in silence for ages as though oblivious of\r\nher existence. She had observed the same thing in Bompard and La Touche\r\nwho would sit cheek by jowl without a word, as though they had\r\nquarrelled. This trait pleased her, and she fell in with it\r\nunconsciously as though his mind had moulded hers and were teaching it\r\nthe taciturnity of the sea.\r\n\r\nOne day, during a brief spell of calm when they were seated in the sun,\r\ndinner over and nothing to do, she tried the effect of literature upon\r\nhim. She told him the story of Jack and the Bean Stalk and was delighted\r\nto find him interested when he had got his bearings and knew that a\r\n\"giant\" was a man fifty feet high; the cutting open of the giant--it\r\noccurred in her version--pleased him immensely. Then when she had\r\nfinished she was alarmed to find, from words dropped by him, that he\r\nconsidered the story to be true, or at least to be taken seriously. She\r\ndid not disillusion him; to do so she would have had to tell him that\r\nshe had lied. That was the funny part of the thing. He would have said\r\nto himself \"what made her lie to me about that chap?\" By no possible\r\nmeans could he have imagined a person sitting down to invent in cold\r\nblood for the amusement of others a yarn about what never happened; no,\r\nit would have struck him as one of those lying personal yarns heard in\r\nthe fo'c'sle sometimes and likely to produce a boot aimed at the\r\nteller's head. He had seen men reading books in the fo'c'sle\r\noccasionally and old newspapers, but of literature, fictional or\r\notherwise, he had no more idea than the bull sea elephants of astronomy.\r\n\r\nThis she intuitively felt and so held her tongue. But she had interested\r\nhim, and she went on, producing from her memory the story of the Forty\r\nThieves.\r\n\r\nNow he had accepted the bean stalk explanation, for he had never to his\r\nknowledge seen a bean stalk, but the jars in the Forty Thieves he\r\nrevolted at, for a jar to him was a demijohn, or a thing of that size. A\r\nman could not get into that.\r\n\r\nHowever, on explanation, he passed the jars, and the boiling oil repaid\r\nhim. He seemed to delight in torture and blood.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get that yarn from?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Out of a book,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Got any more?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Plenty,\" she replied casting round in her mind, and wondering how it\r\nhappens that children's stories run so frequently to blood and ferocity.\r\n\r\nShe remembered Anatole France's story of the juggler who juggled before\r\nthe shrine of Our Lady, having no better offering to make to her, and\r\nRaft sat spellbound, after having made out that Our Lady was the Virgin\r\nMary, the patron of Catholic shipmates. She told it so well and so\r\nsimply, with unobtrusive foot notes as to monasteries and their\r\ncontents, that he could not but see the point, the poor man having\r\nnothing to offer but his stock in trade of tricks, offered it.\r\n\r\nWell, what of that? It was the best he had, and, if she could see the\r\nother chaps doing things for her, she could see him. The story, whose\r\nwhole point lies in the supposed non-existence of the virgin as a\r\ndiscerning being, ought to cast its gentle ridicule not on the ignorant\r\njuggler but on the more learned brethren of the monastery. To Raft they\r\nwere all in the same boat, and as to whether she could see them or not\r\nhe didn't know.\r\n\r\nThe story fell flat, horribly flat, told to the absolutely simple\r\nhearted, and to the Teller, after explanations were over, it seemed that\r\nthe Listener had in some way cut open modern genius and exposed a little\r\ntricky mechanism working on a view point of chilled steel.\r\n\r\nThat Raft, in fact, was so big in a formless way that he was much above\r\nthe story.\r\n\r\nShe remedied her blunder on the next storytelling occasion with Blue\r\nBeard.\r\n\r\nThen the weather broke fair and the islands drew away and the clouds\r\nrose high and the white terns, always flitting like dragon-flies amidst\r\nthe other birds, rose like the clouds, they always flew higher in fine\r\nweather, and with the smooth seas a new thing shewed like a sign: the\r\nlittle sea elephants were no longer confining themselves to the river\r\nand near shore. Some of them were taking boldly to the sea. Their small\r\nheads could be seen sometimes quite a long way out.\r\n\r\nThis fact gave the girl food for thought. The summer was getting on.\r\n\r\nIt almost seemed that Ponting was right, that no ships would venture\r\ninto that sea between the islands and the shore, and that their only\r\nhope of rescue lay in that bay away to the west, heaven knew how far.\r\n\r\nThen an idea came to her. Two ships had already been here for certain:\r\nthe wreck and the ship of Captain Slocum, then there was the cache, some\r\nship must have left that.\r\n\r\nShe told Raft what was in her mind but got little consolation from him.\r\nHe opined that the wreck wouldn't have been a wreck if she had kept\r\nclear of this dangerous water, that the cache might have been left by\r\npeople who had landed somewhere else, and as for Captain Slocum's ship\r\nshe might have been a whaler. Whalers according to Raft were always off\r\nthe beaten track and poking their noses into places where honest deep\r\nsea ships would not dare to go.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said she, \"how about that bay you spoke of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that place,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe hung silent for a moment as if revolving the question in his mind.\r\n\r\n\"But you were set against it,\" said he at last.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know, but I am stronger now, and it seems useless staying here\r\ntill perhaps the winter comes.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused and looked towards the islands. She hated the idea of that\r\njourney which she pictured over rocks and across plains, where? In\r\nsearch of a place that might not exist, and where, if it did exist, no\r\nship might perhaps be found. An almost hopeless journey involving\r\nunknown hardships.\r\n\r\n\"You ain't strong enough,\" suddenly said Raft.\r\n\r\nIt was as though he had touched some spring in her character that set\r\nthe machinery of determination working.\r\n\r\n\"I am strong enough,\" she replied. Then after a moment's pause something\r\nin her began speaking, something that seemed allied to conscience,\r\nrather than thought, something that spoke almost against her will.\r\n\r\n\"We ought to go, we ought not to lose any chance. It seems almost\r\nhopeless, but it is the right thing to do. To stay here is not fighting,\r\nand in this place one has to fight if one wants to live or to get away.\r\nI feel that. To sit here with one's hands folded is wicked.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe in making a fight,\" said the other, \"question is, will\r\nwe be any the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's always the chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, there's always a chance.\"\r\n\r\nThen an idea came to her.\r\n\r\n\"How about the boat?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"That old boat along the beach?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, suppose we took her and rowed down the coast.\"\r\n\r\n\"There aren't no oars in her.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are oars. I hid them amongst the bushes and I can find them\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nRaft considered the proposition for a moment, then he shook his head and\r\ntapped the dottle out of his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"Not with them winds that get you here,\" said he, \"they let out when\r\nyou're least expecting it and we'd be on to the rocks and done for. I'm\r\nnot saying if we had a boat crew we mightn't try, but we're\r\nunder-handed. No, we'll have to hoof it if we go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hoof it--what is that?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Walk it,\" replied Raft, \"and I'm thinking it's beyond you, you aren't\r\nfit for travelling rough, like me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't I?--I suppose I don't look strong, but I am, of course I'm not\r\nas strong as you, but I can keep on once I begin, and I have been\r\nthrough a good deal ever since that night we were wrecked, I don't think\r\nany journey we could make would be worse than that. And I was not\r\nprepared for all that as I am now for anything that may happen. Think of\r\nit, we had all been sitting at dinner, it was only a little while after\r\ndinner and I had my evening frock on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your evening which?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dress. They were all rich people on board the yacht and they put on\r\ndifferent clothes always for dinner. It seems stupid--well, I was down\r\nbelow and I suddenly felt that I must get on deck, so I put on these\r\nclothes and my oilskin and sou'wester, then, as I was coming upstairs\r\nthe collision happened. I got on deck and it was quite dark until the\r\nelectric light was put on, then I saw the stern of your ship with the\r\nname on it.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused with a little shudder and seemed visualizing the terrible\r\npicture again.\r\n\r\n\"Heave ahead,\" said Raft interestedly.\r\n\r\n\"Then I was thrown into a boat and forgot everything until I woke in the\r\nearly morning alone with those two men. It was all just like that. I\r\nwasn't prepared for hardship as I am now, and I hadn't a companion like\r\nyou. Those two men were no use.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Well, they were always grumbling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mind that so much, but they were no use, they wouldn't do\r\nthings. I had to make them go and hunt for firewood, they might just as\r\nwell have had no hands. Bompard, the oldest one wasn't so bad--\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the other chap you done in,\" said Raft. \"Well, I reckon you've\r\nbeen through it. Rum thing I saw you first when I was handling a topsail\r\nin that blow. The weather broke and I was holdin' on to the yard when I\r\nsighted you away to starboard with the sun on you. Old Ponting was close\r\nto me and he yelled out he'd seen you before and give you your name, the\r\n_Gaston de Paree_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we sighted you,\" said she, \"I was down below when the steward came\r\nwith a message that there was a ship in sight, I came up and there you\r\nwere with the sun on you and the storm clouds behind, and do you know\r\nyou frightened me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How so?\" asked Raft.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I felt there was going to be a disaster of some sort--it\r\nwas almost like a warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no saying,\" said Raft. \"I've known a chap warned he was\r\ngoing to be drowned, and drowned he was sure enough. I was down below\r\nasleep and shot out of my bunk by the smash; then I was on the main\r\ndeck, the chaps all round shouting for boats, and if you ask me how I\r\ngot off I couldn't tell you. One minute a big light was blazing, then it\r\nwas black as thunder. My mind seemed to go when the black came on, I'd\r\nno more thought than a blind puppy. Something saved me. That's all I\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"God saved you,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe He did,\" said Raft; \"but what made Him let all the other\r\nchaps drown?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she replied, \"but He saved you just as He saved me. I\r\nknow He looks after things. Look at those sea elephants and the gulls;\r\nHe leads them about by instinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Raft.\r\n\r\n\"Instinct,\" said she, suddenly formulating the idea, \"is God's mind, it\r\ntells the birds and elephants where to get food and where to go and how\r\nto avoid danger; you and I have minds of our own, but our minds are\r\nnothing to the minds of the birds and animals. They are never wrong.\r\nLook out there at those porpoises.\"\r\n\r\n\"Them black fish,\" said Raft, shading his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, well, look at the way they are going along, they are on a journey,\r\ngoing somewhere, led by instinct, and I think when human beings find\r\nthemselves having to fight for life they fall back on instinct, the\r\nmind of God comes to help them. Look at me. I believe I found that cache\r\nled by instinct and I would never have pulled through only instinct told\r\nme I would, somehow. God's mind told me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's no saying,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to leave here,\" she went on, \"but I feel we ought to go.\r\nThe chances seem small, even if we find that bay; still, I feel we ought\r\nto go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm feelin' the same way myself,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"Then we will go and the sooner we start the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking of them porpoises,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"What about them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's a saying they hug the shore pretty close if bad weather\r\nis coming. It's fine to-day, but I've a feeling there's going to be\r\nanother blow soon and maybe we'd better wait till it's over--maybe it's\r\ninstinc',\" he finished, looking round shyly.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed. \"If you feel like that,\" said she, \"we had certainly\r\nbetter wait. Maybe the porpoises were sent to tell us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no saying,\" replied he. They were seated on the rocks just\r\nwhere she had watched the great battle and far and near the \"sea cows\"\r\nwere sunning themselves on the rocks whilst beyond the seal beach the\r\npenguins were drilling in long lines. Scarcely a breath of wind stirred\r\nand the sea lay calm like a sheet of dim blue glass to where the islands\r\nsat beneath the sky of summer.\r\n\r\nBut the islands had drawn closer since morning and the birds seemed\r\nbusier than usual and more clamorous. To the eastward where the cliffs\r\nrose higher, guillemots had their home on the ledges of basalt and the\r\nwheezy bagpipe-like cry of them came in bursts every now and then as\r\nthough they were angry about something, whilst the cry of the razorbills\r\nand the \"get-away, get-away\" of the kittiwakes had a sharper note. The\r\npuffins alone were calm, swimming in coveys on the glassy water and\r\nleaving long ripples in their wake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT WIND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun sank, broadened out and banded with mist beyond the Lizard\r\nPoint, and before his upper limb had been swallowed by the rocks the\r\nbusiness began with a blow from the hills.\r\n\r\nMost winds come in gusts and pauses, this wind from the Infernal Regions\r\ncame at first steady and warm, never ceasing, steadily growing like the\r\nthrust of an infinite sword driven with a rapidly increasing momentum\r\nand a murmur like the voice of Speed herself.\r\n\r\nRaft and the girl saw that the sea elephants were herding up into the\r\nshelter of the cliffs and that the gulls had vanished as though they had\r\nnever been.\r\n\r\nAnd still the wind increased, its voice now a long monotonous cry,\r\nsteadily sharpening, yet deepening, stern as the Voice of Wrath.\r\n\r\n\"It's blowing up,\" said Raft, \"and there's more coming.\"\r\n\r\nThen over the cliff and undershot by the last rays of sunset came the\r\nclouds chased and harried by the wind, tearing before and torn by the\r\nteeth of the gale.\r\n\r\nRaft and the girl stood watching till pebbles and rocks the size of\r\ncoconuts began to fall on the beach blown over the cliff edge, till the\r\nsea, flat and milk-white, seemed to bend under the stress, till it would\r\nseem that the very islands would be blown away.\r\n\r\nThe girl felt light-headed and giddy as though the rush above had\r\nrarefied the air under the cliffs. Not a drop of rain fell, the wind\r\nheld the sky and the whole world. It seemed loosed from some mysterious\r\nkeeping never to be recaptured until it had blown the sea away and\r\nflattened the earth.\r\n\r\nAnd still it increased.\r\n\r\nRaft, taking the girl by the arm, drew her back into the cave; she was\r\ntrembling. It seemed to her that this was no storm, that something had\r\ngone wrong with the scheme of things, that this Voice steadily being\r\nkeyed up was the voice of some string keeping everything together,\r\nstretched to its utmost and sure to snap.\r\n\r\nThen it snapped.\r\n\r\nThe whole of Kerguelen seemed to burst like a bomb-shell with a blaze of\r\nlight shewing islands and sea.\r\n\r\nThen again it seemed to burst with a light struggling through a deluge.\r\n\r\nThe boom of the rain on the sea came between the thunder crashes whilst\r\na giant on the hills seemed to stand steadily working a flashlight, a\r\nlight so intense that now and again through broken walls of rain the\r\nislands could be seen like far white ghosts wreathed in mist.\r\n\r\nThey sat down on the floor of the cave and the man put his arm about the\r\ngirl as if to protect her; then something came sniffing at them, it was\r\na little sea elephant that had got astray and scared by the work outside\r\nhad crept in for shelter and company. The girl rested her hand on it and\r\nit lay still.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her now that she could hear the gods of the storm as they\r\nbattled, hear their cries and breathing and trampling, whilst every\r\nmoment a thousand foot giant in full armour would come crashing to\r\nearth, knee, shoulder and helmet hitting the rocks in succession.\r\n\r\n\"It's a big blow,\" came Raft's voice, \"no call to be scared.\"\r\n\r\nHe was holding her to him like a child whilst she held to her the little\r\nsea elephant, and so they remained, the three of them until the big\r\nblow, failing to tear Kerguelen from its foundations, began to pause\r\nlike a spent madman.\r\n\r\nThe flashlight man on the hills began to work his apparatus more slowly\r\nand now the thunder seemed doing its vast work away out at sea and all\r\nsounds became gradually merged in the enormous, continuous sound of the\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nThe little sea elephant seemed suddenly to take fright at the strange\r\ncompany it found itself in and went tumbling and sniffing out to find\r\nits mates, whilst through the night came the occasional \"woof\" of a bull\r\nas if giving praise that the worst was over.\r\n\r\n\"The old sea cows know it's done,\" said Raft, \"now you'd better get\r\nunder your blankets,--you aren't afraid to be alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid a bit now,\" said she. She patted his hand as a child\r\nmight and he crawled out and she heard him swearing at the rain as he\r\nmade for his hole in the cliff.\r\n\r\nShe remembered the porpoises and fell to thinking of what would have\r\nhappened had she and Raft started on their expedition yesterday or the\r\nday before. That wind, which sent rocks flying on to the beach, would\r\nhave blown them away.\r\n\r\nShe said this next morning as they stood watching the sea. The sea was\r\nworth watching. The due-south wind had stirred the heart of the ocean\r\nfrom west of Enderby land, and, like a trumpeter, was leading a vast\r\nflood that split on Heard Island only to re-form and burst on the\r\nsouthern shores of Kerguelen.\r\n\r\nThey could hear the vague far-off roar of it all those leagues away\r\nbeyond the mountains, mixed with the cry of the wind still blowing a\r\nfull gale, and beyond the shelter of the land they could see the islands\r\ngetting it, bombarded by the waves and up to their shoulders in\r\nsea-smoke and foam.\r\n\r\nThen as they stood, suddenly and like a thing shot dead, the wind\r\nceased, and in the silence the roar of the beaches far and near arose\r\nlike a fume of sound. Then, as suddenly, the wind came shouting out of\r\nthe west, piling up a cross sea that leapt like the water in a boiling\r\npot.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking when this blow is over we may have a spell of fine\r\nweather,\" said Raft, \"and it will be just as well for us to be making\r\nour plans and getting things ready so's we won't be behind hand when the\r\nfine spell comes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so too,\" said she, \"we will have to take food with us--how\r\nmuch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough for a month,\" said he, \"who knows, we may have to come back, and\r\nthere's not much to be had elsewhere.\" Then he fell into thought for a\r\nmoment, \"maybe stuff for a fortnight will be enough for there's birds\r\nand rabbits to be got, and gulls' eggs. Them old penguins let you screw\r\ntheir necks as if it come natural to them, we don't want to take too big\r\na load.\"\r\n\r\nThen they found themselves at a loss, it was quite easy to arrange to\r\ntake a fortnight's food, but how much did that mean?\r\n\r\nThey determined to use two blankets for sacks and then made a rough\r\ncalculation, based on imagination, and collected together tins of meat\r\nand vegetables and the remaining biscuits, the result was a burden that\r\ntwo people might have carried but not very far.\r\n\r\n\"We've overshot it,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"We'll never be able to carry all that,\" said the girl, \"or if we did we\r\nwould have to go so slowly that the journey would be much longer--it\r\ncuts both ways.\"\r\n\r\nThey reduced the load by nearly a half.\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing,\" said he, \"there's no call to take water with us,\r\nthere's holes full of water everywhere, seems to me in this place.\"\r\n\r\nThen he turned to look at the weather.\r\n\r\nThe wind was less and the clouds were thinning and the air had the feel\r\nof a break coming. Then, just before sunset the clouds parted in the west\r\nand the sun went down in a sky red as blood.\r\n\r\n\"We'll start tomorrow,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE CORRIDOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning broke grey and fair.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl came out she found that Raft had collected the things to\r\nbe taken in one bundle tied up in a blanket. He had also set out\r\nbreakfast. The remainder of the stores he had stacked at the back of the\r\ncave where he slept.\r\n\r\nThese stores, with what was still in the cache, would be useful if they\r\nhad to come back to the beach.\r\n\r\n\"But what am I to carry?\" asked she.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there's no call for you to trouble,\" answered he, \"you've got your\r\noilskins. I reckon that'll be enough for you to bother with. Them things\r\nin the bundle is no weight for a man.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to argue the question. It seemed to her impossible that any\r\nsingle person could carry that load for long, but she might just as well\r\nhave argued with the gentle wind blowing now shorewards from the\r\nislands. He lifted the bundle with one great hand to demonstrate its\r\nlightness; he was also going to take the harpoon as a sort of walking\r\nstick.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that she had never realized his strength before, nor\r\nhis placid determination that seemed more like an elemental force than\r\nthe will of a man.\r\n\r\nShe gave in and sat down to the meal, biscuits and the remains of a\r\nstew, and as she ate she watched the great sea bulls and the cows and\r\nthe young ones that now were able to land, boosting through the foam\r\nlike their elders, and as she watched she wondered whether she would\r\never see these things again, there, against the setting of the sea and\r\nthe great islands.\r\n\r\nShe had put on her boots for the journey and a pair of men's soft\r\nwoollen socks from the store in the cache. They were small men's socks\r\nand the wool was so fine and soft that the size did not trouble her. In\r\nher pocket she still carried the few odds and ends including the tobacco\r\nbox in which she had placed her rings. She wore the sou'wester, and the\r\noilskin lay beside her folded and ready to be carried on her arm.\r\n\r\nThen, when the meal was finished, Raft washed the plates and stored them\r\nin the cave. He stood looking at the stored things for a moment as if to\r\nmake sure they would be all right, then he kicked an old tin away into a\r\ncleft of the rocks as though to tidy the place, then he took up the\r\nharpoon and slung the bundle on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe girl rose and looked around her. This place where she had suffered\r\nand nearly died was still warm with memories, and the sea creatures were\r\nlike friends, she had grown to love them just as people love trees or\r\nfamiliar inanimate things.\r\n\r\nTo associate the idea of home with that desolate beach, those moving\r\nmonsters, those caves, would seem absurd. Well, it was like leaving\r\nhome, and as she stood looking around her a tightness came in her throat\r\nand her eyes grew misty. But Raft was moving now and she followed him,\r\nglancing back now and then until they crossed the river where she looked\r\nback for the last time. The river was almost deserted now by the young\r\nsea elephants, except at its mouth. A few little girl seals lay about,\r\ndelicate or unadventurous creatures whose lives would doubtless be short\r\nin a world that is only for the strong. These little girl seals had\r\nattracted her attention before, they had almost the ways of fine ladies.\r\nIt was as though some germ of civilization in the herd had become\r\nconcentrated in them and she had wondered whether they would ever pull\r\nthrough the rough and tumble of life, recognising vaguely that nature is\r\nopposed to civilization at heart. They seemed allied to herself and\r\ntheir future seemed as doubtful as her own here where nothing helped,\r\nwhere everything opposed.\r\n\r\nShe caressed them with her eyes for the last time; then as she turned\r\nand followed Raft she forgot them. Her brave mind, that nothing could\r\ndaunt but loneliness, faced the great adventure ahead not only undaunted\r\nbut uplifted. The way was terrific, the chances were small, so small, so\r\nremote, that they could scarcely be called chances, and the penalty of\r\nfailure was return and a winter here when the beach would be deserted by\r\nall but the gulls. The very desperation of the business made it great,\r\nand from the greatness came the uplift.\r\n\r\nThey passed the figure-head with its sphinx-like face staring over the\r\nsea, and the great skull half sanded over by the recent blow. Then they\r\ndrew near the caves and the boat.\r\n\r\nThe boat had been blown over on its other side by the wind and lay with\r\none gunnel deep buried in the sand and its keel presented to the cliffs;\r\nshe glanced only once at the caves, deserted now by the birds who had no\r\ndoubt picked the last fragments of the dead man.\r\n\r\nThen they climbed the Lizard rocks and at the highest point sat down to\r\nrest for a moment.\r\n\r\nRaft, with the bundle beside him and the harpoon held between his knees,\r\nswung his head from the great beach on his right to the broken country\r\non his left.\r\n\r\nHe said nothing, not wishing perhaps to dishearten his companion. It was\r\nshe who spoke.\r\n\r\n\"That's the plain I told you of,\" said she, \"we mustn't cross it, you\r\ncan see from here some of the dangerous patches, those yellow ones, but\r\nthere are others just as bad that you can't tell till you are trapped in\r\nthem. I would have gone down, only a bird flying overhead dropped a fish\r\non the ground right in front of me and the fish disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better get along the sea-shore rocks, seems to me,\" said Raft,\r\n\"the tide's going out, all them rocks between tide marks is pretty\r\nflat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the tide comes in,\" said she, \"and we can't get up the cliffs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we'll have lots of time to make a good way before it comes back,\"\r\nreplied he, \"and we've got to trust a bit to chance, we've got to strike\r\nbold. I reckon we'd better trust to instinc'.\" He laughed in his beard.\r\n\"The same sort of instinc' that made that bird drop the fish to give you\r\nsoundin's of that mud hole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Providence,\" said she, \"yes--you are right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe in strikin' bold,\" said he, almost as though he were talking\r\nto himself. \"It's like fighting with a chap, the fellow that does the\r\nhittin' without bothering about bein' hit. He's the chap. Well, if\r\nyou're restored, we'll be gettin' along.\"\r\n\r\nHe heaved up and led the way, striking right down to the sea and pausing\r\nnow and then to help her. Once he lifted her as though she were a\r\nfeather from one rock to the other. Then, all of a sudden they came to a\r\nten foot drop. There was no getting round that drop, it was a basalt\r\nstep that circled the whole Lizard Point on its seaward side. It did not\r\ndisconcert Raft. He threw the harpoon down, then he lowered himself,\r\nclutching the edge and let himself fall. Following his directions she\r\nthrew him the bundle. It would have felled an ordinary landsman, but he\r\ncaught it, placed it beside him and then ordered her to jump, just as\r\nshe stood, without lowering herself.\r\n\r\n\"Jump with your arms up,\" said he, laughing, \"no call to lower yourself.\r\nI'll catch you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was like an order to commit suicide. It seemed to her impossible, she\r\nthought that he only spoke in fun, then she knew that he was in earnest,\r\nthat he was ordering her. But it was impossible--absolutely. Then she\r\njumped with arms raised, jumped into two great hands that clipped her\r\nround the waist and brought her, feet to ground, with scarcely a jar.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think you'd have done it,\" said he. \"You ain't wanting in\r\npluck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it would be all right if you told me,\" said she, \"but I didn't\r\nwant to do it until the very last moment.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that she would have jumped over a cliff if he had told her. It\r\nseemed to her that he was invincible--infallible.\r\n\r\nA climb of a couple of minutes brought them down to the tide mark rocks,\r\nthe tide was a quarter out and the sea comparatively calm and the rocks\r\nflat-topped like those of the seal beach and free from seaweed except\r\nwhere, here and there, were piled masses of giant kelp torn up from its\r\ndeep sea attachments and cast here by the waves. It lay in ridges that\r\nhad to be climbed over sometimes and seemed entirely confined to the\r\nLizard Point and the rocks beyond, for when they reached where the\r\ncliffs began it ceased to occur.\r\n\r\nWhere the cliffs began they first experienced the true meaning of a\r\njourney along that coast.\r\n\r\nShe had seen these cliffs from the boat, but that view, though\r\nforbidding enough, had told her little of the reality.\r\n\r\nThey rose from two to four hundred feet in height, these cliffs, and\r\nlooking up was like looking up a wall of polished ebony.\r\n\r\nHere and there they were streaked with long lines of white where the\r\nguillemots in their thousands sat on ledges, and here and there they\r\nwere faced by seaward rocks standing out in the water and carved by the\r\nwaves into all sorts of fantastic shapes, but waves and rocks and sea\r\nand sky, all these were nothing, here the cliffs were everything,\r\ndominating the mind and soul, sinister, and tinging every sound from the\r\nwave echoes to the gull voices with tragedy.\r\n\r\nAnd high tide mark was the cliff base in fine weather, in foul, the\r\nwaves would lash and dash and beat fifty feet up, there was not a\r\nguillemot ledge lower than eighty feet, puffins, razorbills and\r\nkittiwakes, who always build above the guillemots did not seem to come\r\nhere at all, keeping to the seaward rocks and the coast line where the\r\ncliffs drew further away from the sea.\r\n\r\nWith the sea so close on the right and the cliffs on the left the girl\r\nfelt like a mouse in a trap designed for an elephant. Alone she would\r\nnever have dared this road, even with Raft leading her she felt timid\r\nand oppressed. The place did not seem to affect Raft. Plodding ahead as\r\nindifferently as though he were on some civilized country road, he\r\ntalked to her now and then over his shoulder, calling attention to queer\r\nshaped crabs or dead kelp fish, and ever as they went their road grew\r\nbroader as the tide drew out.\r\n\r\nIt was now about an hour and a half after high water, that is to say,\r\nquarter ebb; in a little more than ten hours it would be high water\r\nagain, before that they must find a way from the beach or be drowned.\r\nRaft knew this and the girl knew it too. It seemed almost impossible\r\nthat, with so much time before them, they could not find a break in the\r\ncliffs towards safe ground, yet the cliffs seemed to stretch endlessly\r\nbefore them and their pace was slow, not more than three miles an hour.\r\nThey rested sometimes for a moment watching the out-going sea and the\r\ngulls; unused to exercise the girl was tired, and the man knew it. Alone\r\nhe could have travelled swiftly and without resting, but he said\r\nnothing, and though he knew the necessity of speed, it was he who made\r\nthe halts for the sake of his companion. Three hours after noon he took\r\nsome food out of the bundle and made her eat. They had already drunk\r\nfrom a little torrent rushing out of a crack in the cliff wall, but even\r\nso the food seemed dry and she could scarcely swallow it. Anxiety had\r\nher in its grip, the cliffs stretching on and on interminably seemed\r\nlike misfortune itself made visible.\r\n\r\nSaid Raft: \"The tide's near the turn and them cliffs don't shew no sign\r\nof a cut in them, but then there's only two miles or so to be seen from\r\nhere. Round that bend there's no knowing, they may break away beyond\r\nthere. What I'm thinkin' is this. We've time to get back along the road\r\nwe've come by before it's high water again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go back?\"\r\n\r\n\"We've time to do it; if we keep on our course it will take us maybe\r\nnear an hour to get to that shoulder and from there we won't have much\r\ntime to get back before high water again. We've cut it too fine and if\r\nthe tide comes back and catches us before we get to a break we're done.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked forward then she looked back. They were in a veritable\r\ncorridor. The sea formed the right hand wall of this corridor, the\r\ncliffs varying from two hundred to three hundred feet high formed the\r\nleft hand wall, cliffs black as ebony, polished by sea washing,\r\nunclimbable and tremendous as a dream of Dante.\r\n\r\nShe saw their full position. There was time to get back from where they\r\nstood, but if they went on to the cape of cliff before them there would\r\nbe no time to get back, they would have to go on, and the unseen cliffs\r\nbeyond that cape might stretch for twenty miles unclimbable as here.\r\n\r\nYet the idea of going back was horrible, heartbreaking.\r\n\r\nShe saw that Raft was between two moods. Then she said to him.\r\n\r\n\"If you were alone would you go back or go on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Me?\" said Raft. He paused for a moment as if in thought--\"Oh, I reckon\r\nI'd go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinkin' of you,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I know--but I could not bear to go back. If we fail now like that we\r\nwill fail altogether. Imagine going all that way back. No, I couldn't.\r\nWe must risk it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking that way,\" said he.\r\n\r\nHe picked up the bundle and harpoon and they started, and no sooner had\r\nshe taken the first step than Fear laid his hand on her heart and a wild\r\ncraving to return seized her so that she could have cried out.\r\n\r\nShe had once said that she feared an ugly face more than a blow, and the\r\nfear that seized her now was less the fear of death than the fear of the\r\ncliffs and their conspiracy with the murmuring sea that would soon be an\r\ninclosing wall.\r\n\r\nShe fought it down.\r\n\r\nThe cliff shoulder was further away than they thought; it took them an\r\nhour to reach it and, when they turned it, there, before them lay cliffs\r\nhigher, more monstrous and running in a curve to another shoulder seven\r\nmiles away, if a yard. But towards the middle of the curve the cliff\r\nface seemed ridged and broken near the base. Raft shading his eyes,\r\npointed out this broken surface.\r\n\r\n\"It looks as if there was foothold there beyond tide mark,\" said he,\r\n\"we've got to go on anyhow--Lord, but you're tired!\"\r\n\r\nHe made her sit down. The sight of that gargantuan sweep of cliff coming\r\non top of the weariness of the journey had crushed her. To go forward\r\nseemed impossible, to fight against that immensity impossible. She could\r\nhave wept but she had neither tears nor energy. The gods seemed to have\r\nbuilt those bastions to shut out all hope and the voice of the returning\r\nsea seemed like a tide turning over her broken thoughts like pebbles.\r\n\r\nRaft standing over her like a tower said not a word.\r\n\r\nMixed with the voice of the sea came the voices of the gulls and all\r\nsorts of sea echoes from the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThen as she sat she made a supreme effort of mind. She must rise and go\r\non. She struggled to rise, but her limbs had left her, deserted her,\r\nstricken as if by paralysis.\r\n\r\nRaft took off his cap and put it in his pocket, then he went to the\r\ncliff side and rested the harpoon against it, standing up. She watched\r\nhim, vaguely wondering what he was about, then he returned to her and\r\nbent down and she found herself lifted suddenly and seated on his left\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on to my hair,\" cried he. Then he bent and picked up the bundle,\r\nwent to the cliff side and picked up the harpoon and started. The giant\r\nstrength that had caught her when she jumped from the Lizard Point ledge\r\nwas carrying her now like a feather, the crook of his left arm round her\r\nlegs to steady her, the harpoon clutched in his left hand, the bundle\r\nswung over his right shoulder.\r\n\r\nAnd she held on to his hair as a child might, without a word, and as she\r\nheld the strength of him seemed to permeate her through her fingers\r\ncasting fear and misery out.\r\n\r\nShe felt as a tiny tired child feels when caught up and carried by its\r\nmother, and carrying her so he strode on, cursing himself for not having\r\ncarried her before.\r\n\r\nIt was a three-mile journey to that roughness on the cliff and as he\r\ndrew near he saw that they were saved, at least for the time.\r\n\r\nThe rock broke here in ledges like steps and twenty feet up and well\r\nbeyond tide mark ran a little plateau some ten or twelve feet broad.\r\n\r\nShe saw it as well as he and filled with new strength she cried out to\r\nbe set down.\r\n\r\n\"Stay easy,\" said Raft. \"It's easier to carry the bundle with you on my\r\nshoulder, you ain't no weight.\"\r\n\r\nThen when he reached the steps:\r\n\r\n\"Done it b'God,\" said he.\r\n\r\nHe dropped the bundle and harpoon, and, lifting her, set her feet on the\r\nbasalt steps.\r\n\r\n\"Can you climb it?\" asked he.\r\n\r\nWithout a word she climbed and sitting on the little plateau looked down\r\non him.\r\n\r\nThen he followed with the things and took his seat beside her. They sat\r\nfor a while without a word, the bare rocks and the grey sea before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA great rock out at sea, pierced and arched like the frame work of a\r\ndoor, shewed through its opening the sea beyond. Gulls flew round it and\r\ntheir eternal complaint came on the wind blowing, still lightly, from\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nRaft seemed absorbed in thought.\r\n\r\nThen he said: \"It won't be high water until gettin' on for dark. We'd\r\nbetter stick here the night anyhow and get the low tide to-morrow. But\r\nthere's time for me now to get to that next shoulder and see what's\r\nbeyond, it's a matter of four miles there maybe and four miles back.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you,\" said she, \"I'm stronger now.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you stick here,\" said he. \"There's no call for two to go. You'll\r\nwant your strength for the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only for you I wouldn't be here,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe you wouldn't,\" said Raft. \"It's as well I was along with\r\nyou, but you ain't no weight--no more than a kitten. I never thought you\r\nwere as bad as that or I'd have lifted you miles back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you tired?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Me--oh, no, not more than a bit stiff in the arm.\" He stretched his\r\nleft arm out. Then he looked at the bundle.\r\n\r\n\"You don't want nothing to eat just yet?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"Not till you come back,\" she answered. \"I'll watch you from here.\"\r\n\r\nHe scrambled down, picked up the harpoon which he had left on the rocks\r\nand then looked up and nodded to her.\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep in sight,\" said he. Then he started.\r\n\r\nShe watched his great figure as it went, harpoon in hand, growing\r\nsmaller and smaller, till, now, she could have covered it with her thumb\r\nnail. As the distance increased it seemed to go slower and the great\r\nblack cliffs to grow higher.\r\n\r\nAt a dizzy height above her cormorants had their nests, they seemed\r\nangry about something as they clanged and flew, shooting out into the\r\nsky and wheeling back again in an aimless manner. Before her the grey\r\nsea crawled, coming, now, steadily shoreward.\r\n\r\nThe tide seemed coming in faster than usual. She knew that this could\r\nnot be so and that Raft was too wise to allow himself to be cut off, all\r\nthe same a smouldering anxiety fed on her heart as she watched the tiny\r\nfigure now approaching the out-jutting shoulder of cliff. Then it\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nHe had promised to keep in sight.\r\n\r\nEvidently that was impossible if he wanted to get a view of what lay\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nA minute passed, two, three--then the figure reappeared and her heart\r\nthat had lain still sprang to life again.\r\n\r\nAs he drew closer she saw him stoop and pick up something, then he came\r\nright up to the cliff face, paused a minute and continued his way\r\ntowards her, walking more slowly now and carrying the thing in his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nIt was a big shell shaped like an abalone. He had filled it with water\r\nfrom a little torrent running from the cliff and when he reached her he\r\nheld it up to show.\r\n\r\n\"We're all right,\" cried he, \"there's only four or five miles of cliff\r\nbeyond the point, then it breaks away down to the beach. We'll be able\r\nto get clear of this to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe came down the basalt steps and took the shell from him. He had\r\nwashed it in the torrent so that the water had no taint of salt. Then,\r\ncarrying it carefully she got it to the plateau where he followed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nNIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nTowards dark the incoming tide began to hit the cliff base. Raft had\r\ntaken the things from the bundle and had made her wrap herself in the\r\nblanket. \"You ain't used to the weather like me,\" said he, \"and this is\r\nnothing to bother about. Lucky it's not blowing. Lucky we made this\r\nshelf. Hark at that!\"\r\n\r\nThe first full blow of a wave hit the basalt below them with a\r\nheart-sickening thud; then miles of stricken cliff began to boom. The\r\nterrific corridor was no more, and between them and the Lizard point so\r\nmany miles away to the east and the point of safety miles away to the\r\nwest, there was nothing but cliff washed by sea.\r\n\r\n\"A rotten coast,\" said Raft as they listened. \"Only for this shelf we'd\r\nbe down there.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd have been flung against the cliff and beaten to pieces,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"When we get free from this,\" she said, \"let us keep inland. I don't\r\nmind climbing over rocks, anything is better than the coast, under these\r\ncliffs.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to keep pretty close to the cliffs, all the same, to strike\r\nthat bay,\" he replied, \"hope it's there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is there,\" said she. \"I feel--I know it is there and that we will\r\nfind a ship. We are being looked after.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are being led. You remember when you saved me from dying in that\r\ncave, well, you were making for the bay then. If you had not found me\r\nyou would have kept on and you would have crossed that plain where the\r\nbog places are, it looked the easiest way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"Bompard was swallowed up there. You would have been swallowed up too;\r\nyou were led to find me for both our sakes. Then, to-day, I could have\r\ngone no further only for you, and you remember how we thought of going\r\nback? This ledge was here waiting for us. It tells us we have to go on\r\nand be brave and everything will come right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, maybe, you aren't far wrong,\" replied the other, \"we've scraped\r\nthrough so far and maybe we'll scrape through to the end. My main wish\r\nis to have a plank under foot again, there ain't no give and take in\r\nland, I'm never surefooted on land, there's no lift in it. I reckon I'm\r\nlike one of them sea chickens not used to solid stuff underfoot. D'you\r\nknow what one of them gulls does first thing he lands on board a ship by\r\nchance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"He gets sick as a dog.\"\r\n\r\nThe cliff had an echo which, when it was not answering some loud boost\r\nof the sea managed to return words, and between the smack of two waves\r\nthe girl heard it remark something about a dog. But the echo of the\r\ncliff soon had its mouth too full to hold words. The sea now nearly at\r\nfull flood was bringing big waves along with it. In the gloom they could\r\nsee the racing grey ghosts, and here, on account of the curve, there was\r\nlittle rhythm in the sound of it that came like the continuous thunder\r\nof big drums. At their feet, like the licking vicious tongue of the\r\nroaring monster, came the continuous gash-gash of waves washing up and\r\nfalling back.\r\n\r\nThe girl sat with the blanket around her leaning close up against the\r\nman. She felt as a person feels standing before the cage of a tiger\r\nuncertain as to the strength of the bars, sometimes a puff of wind\r\nbrought a touch of spray on her face, whilst the continuous muffled\r\nthunder of the coast leagues seemed like the bastions of the whole world\r\nat war with the sea.\r\n\r\n\"There's no call to be afraid,\" said Raft. He seemed, by some special\r\nfaculty, to be able to divine her feelings.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not exactly afraid,\" she replied. \"It's just that everything seems\r\nso big--and those cliffs, now, even when they are hidden, they make one\r\nknow they are there, they seem wicked and alive, yet not able to move.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've hit it,\" said he, \"they're for all the world as if they were\r\nlooking at a chap. It's a rotten coast, but it's near high water now and\r\nthe tide will soon be drawing out.\"\r\n\r\nThis cheered her.\r\n\r\nThen the whale birds began to cry and flit about. The whale birds are\r\nblind by daylight and their voices scarcely ever heard, they are the\r\nowls of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe girl talked about them for something to say, then she fell to\r\nwondering why on a beach like this there were no sea elephants. Raft\r\nexplained \"sea cows\" would never come to a washed beach like this, there\r\nwere no dry rocks for them to \"hang about\" on.\r\n\r\nHe had lit his pipe with the tinder box and the smell of the tobacco\r\ncame good and comforting, the slap and dash of the waves sounded less\r\nvicious, too, as though the sea had done its worst to get at them and\r\nwas foiled.\r\n\r\nThen she said, apropos of nothing but the last of her wandering\r\nthoughts: \"Have you ever seen a man killed?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed as though over some pleasant reminiscence. \"Dozens.\" Then he\r\nbegan to recall chaps he had seen killed, falling from aloft and\r\notherwise. He had seen one hit the sea such a smack it split him open,\r\nand he had seen a chap under water being pulled to pieces by sharks just\r\nas terriers pull an old shoe.\r\n\r\nThen he wandered off to a bar scene where a dago--it was at\r\nNagasaki--had been drinking rice rum and knifed a man, a regular prosy\r\nold sailor's yarn, with \"I says to him,\" and \"he says to me\" at every\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nThen he found that she was leaning more heavily against him and was\r\nasleep. He put his pipe beside him and slipped an arm round her. Then,\r\nas though sleep were infectious, down he sank still holding her and\r\nthere they lay. He snoring gently and she with her head pillowed on his\r\nchest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE SUMMIT\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will break thee.\" Across Kerguelen those words are written to be read\r\nby the soul of man. The rock, the rain, the wind and the sea, these, as\r\ninstruments, would surely be sufficient for the carrying out of the\r\nthreat; but the soul of man is strong, hence the spirit of Kerguelen has\r\ncalled to its assistance Fog.\r\n\r\nSince landing on the great beach the girl had seen the islands\r\nfog-wreathed several times but the beach itself had only once been\r\nattacked.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke on the rock plateau the first word of Raft to her was\r\n\"fog.\"\r\n\r\nThey had slept as the dead sleep for nine hours and Raft had awoken with\r\nthe girl's head still on his chest and feeling as though he were packed\r\nin damp cotton wool. It was after sun up and the fog was so dense that\r\nthe edge of the plateau was only just visible. Through the fog came the\r\nbreaking of the waves; the tide was coming in again.\r\n\r\nRaft had lit his pipe and the girl, stiff from lying, rose up and\r\nstamped about to warm herself. Neither of them spoke a word in the way\r\nof grumbling.\r\n\r\nThe plateau was about twenty yards in length and by drawing off five\r\nyards or so one could have a dressing-room screened with a fog veil, so\r\nthe fog was not an unmixed evil.\r\n\r\nThen they breakfasted, listening to the slashing of the water just below\r\nand counting the time till the out-going sea would let them loose.\r\n\r\n\"It's a good job I went to the point last night,\" said Raft, \"else we\r\nwouldn't be able to start in this smother, not knowing what was beyond\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will we be able to start in this?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Lord, yes,\" replied he, \"the cliffs will give us a lead, it'll be slow\r\ngoing but we'll do it all right, it's not more than six miles or so to\r\nthe break from the point there.\"\r\n\r\n\"When can we start?\"\r\n\r\nRaft listened to the water below, it was breaking now against the near\r\nrocks but not yet against the cliff base.\r\n\r\n\"In another three hours or maybe a bit more,\" said he.\r\n\r\nAn hour later, as though the Fog spirit had been listening and watching,\r\nand as though it despaired of its attack on the heart of the prisoners,\r\nthe smother began to thin; by the time the tide reluctantly began to\r\nfree them it had broken up and patches of the blessed blue sky shewed\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nBy the time they reached the point and had a view of the great cliff\r\nbreak-down that would give them release it was fine weather, with a\r\ngently heaving sea breaking in beneath a sky of summer.\r\n\r\nIt was as though their troubles were ended. At noon they reached the\r\ngreat break-down and a new form of country.\r\n\r\nStretching inland almost to the foothills lay a broad valley, boulder\r\nstrewn, and looking like the bed of some vanished river. Before them to\r\nthe west the ground rose from the valley, gently, unbroken, desolate,\r\nlike nothing so much as the desolate country that borders the Riff coast\r\nof Morocco. But it was ease itself compared to the tumble of rocks\r\naround and beyond the Lizard Point.\r\n\r\nDown the middle of the valley came a little wimpling rivulet like the\r\nremains of the river that had once been. They drank from it and rested\r\nand had some food, then they started with light hearts, taking the easy\r\nascent to the high ground, treading a moss dark and springy like the\r\nmoss that covers the old lava beds of Iceland.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" said the girl.\r\n\r\nThey had reached the highest point and before them, away to the west,\r\nstretched the same rolling dark-smooth country, making low cliffs at the\r\nsea edge and then, as if weary of little things, springing gigantic and\r\nbold towards the sky.\r\n\r\n\"It's over there the bay would be,\" said Raft. \"Ponting said it was a\r\nblack brute of a bay between two cliffs rising higher than a ship's top\r\nmasts. Well, there's our chance before us--if you call it a chance. It's\r\na long way, taking it how you will.\"\r\n\r\nChance! Despite her optimism and belief in being led, as she stood now\r\nwith the wind blowing in her face it seemed to her that she stood\r\nbefore absolute hopelessness.\r\n\r\nNothing, not even the sea corridor, had balked her like that terrible\r\ndistance, calm, sunlit, yet gloomy like a recumbent giant.\r\n\r\nThe monstrosity of the whole adventure unmasked itself of a sudden;\r\ntravelling to find a bay they had heard of on the chance of finding a\r\nship--a ship on a coast where ships were scarcely to be found.\r\n\r\nAnd even if they found the bay they could not wait for a ship. Here\r\nthere was no food, with the exception of rabbits and gulls. The ship\r\nwould have to be there, waiting for them.\r\n\r\nRaft must have been mad! mad! mad! She herself must have been mad to\r\ndream of such a thing.\r\n\r\nHer lips felt dry as pumice stone and she glanced at her companion as he\r\nstood with the bundle at his feet and the harpoon in his hand, looking\r\nabout him, far and near, as unconcerned as though beyond that great hump\r\non the skyline lay a sure town with a railway station.\r\n\r\nNo, Raft was not mad. He was unconcerned. He knew, even better than she,\r\nthe hopelessness of their position, yet he was calm and unmoved, never\r\nfrom the first moment she had seen him had he been otherwise; before\r\neverything, like a rock, he continued.\r\n\r\nYet it was only now, as he quietly stood there surveying their \"chance,\"\r\nthat he came home to her truly as he was, unbreakable; simple, vast,\r\nforged by the sea. She swallowed down the devil of doubt and despair as\r\nshe stood looking at him standing so, and she was about to speak when,\r\ncatching sight of something along the high ground to the right he\r\npointed it out to her. She saw a white point on the ground a couple of\r\nhundred yards away.\r\n\r\nAs they drew close to it it enlarged and other things shewed. It was the\r\ntop of a skull belonging to a skeleton tucked away in a little hollow as\r\nthough it were sheltering from the wind.\r\n\r\nRags of clothing still hung to it and the boots were there still that\r\nhad once belonged to it.\r\n\r\n\"Wonder what did that poor chap in?\" said Raft as he stood looking at\r\nit. \"Wrecked, most likely and lost himself--well, it's a sign folk have\r\nbeen here, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nHe gauged the measure of the desolation around by his words. Here a\r\nskeleton did not make the desolation more desolate; on the contrary, it\r\nproved that folk had been here.\r\n\r\nSo the girl felt.\r\n\r\n\"He'd have been blown away by this only for that hollow he's in,\" said\r\nRaft, \"well, he's out of his troubles whoever he was and whatever ship\r\nhe hailed from.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't bury him,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"He's buried,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\nHe had summed up Kerguelen in two words and there was almost a trace of\r\nbitterness in his voice. Beyond the remark that it was a brute of a\r\ncoast he had never grumbled against the place or abused it or the\r\nAlmighty for making it, as many a man has done; and now at the summit of\r\nthings two words sufficed him.\r\n\r\nThen, leaving the skeleton to the wind and the sky and the countless\r\nages, they turned and went on their way west.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE BAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took them till dusk to reach the foot of the western rise of ground;\r\nhere they slept under a rock, continuing their way next morning,\r\nclimbing till they reached the summit of the rise and keeping their\r\ncourse along the edge of a cliff that fell a sheer three hundred feet to\r\nthe shore below.\r\n\r\nSometimes Raft peeped over the cliff edge and once the girl drew close\r\nand looked, too, dizzy with the height, made more dreadful by the gulls\r\nflying far below.\r\n\r\nAt noon, far ahead of them, they saw something that made them pause; a\r\nlittle mound. As they drew closer they knew. It was another cache, a\r\ncache made of heaped earth and loose stones with about a foot of sign\r\npost protruding from it. The post had been broken off in some storm and\r\nblown away.\r\n\r\n\"There'll be stuff under there,\" said Raft, \"and if we have to go back\r\nit'll come in handy. It's a pointer to the bay anyhow; there must be\r\nsome landin' place near here, we've only got to keep on.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat down and rested and had some food, eating as much as they\r\nwanted now that they had a store to depend on. They had drunk twice\r\nthat morning from pot holes still half-filled with the rain of a few\r\ndays ago and they had no need of water--it is the one thing a man never\r\nneeds in Kerguelen. They were in good spirits; the haunting fear that\r\ntheir provisions might not be enough to last them for the return journey\r\nwas gone; also, if the bay were near, they could remain now some time,\r\neven take up their quarters here to wait on the chance of a ship.\r\n\r\nThe idea came to them to make a burrow into the cache, now, working with\r\nthe harpoon and their hands, and for the purpose of verifying the\r\ncontents; but they put it away, the desire to get on drove them like a\r\nwhip and they went on, halting towards dusk and sleeping in a hollow\r\nthat gave them shelter from the wind that was blowing from the south.\r\n\r\nTowards dawn the wind changed to the west and at the first rays of light\r\nRaft awoke, sat up and sniffed. Then he laid his hand on the girl's\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Smell that!\" cried he.\r\n\r\nShe sat up, her eyes half-blind with sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Smell the wind!\" said Raft.\r\n\r\nShe turned her face to the west. On the wind was coming the ghost of a\r\nsmell, faint and horrible and soul-searching.\r\n\r\n\"That's a ship,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\n\"A ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"Boiling down blubber. I struck that smell once, seven years ago; it's\r\nblubber. I reckon we're all right.\" He heaved himself on to his feet\r\nand the girl half-rose, kneeling, and looked at him.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure as sure; smell it.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as she sniffed again, she knew. That was not a nature smell;\r\nhorrible though it was it was not the tragic smell of corruption. It had\r\nsomething, almost one might say, low down about it, little, mean,\r\nbusiness-like--it was her first sniff of returning Civilization, the\r\nfirst impression on an olfactory sense cleared and cleaned by the winds\r\nof Kerguelen.\r\n\r\nShe looked at Raft. He was standing, shading his eyes as though staring\r\nat the smell. The dawn was at his back, and across the dawn a flight of\r\nwild duck was making in from the sea.\r\n\r\nImagine a person walking in a garret from absolute penury to find\r\nhimself a millionaire. Such a person, were he normal, would feel what\r\nthe girl felt as the message of that noxious odour struck home to her\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nHer teeth chattered a little as she rose to her feet. She could not\r\nspeak and she had to hold her lower jaw with her hand to still it. Then\r\nthe muscles of her throat did all sorts of queer things on their own\r\naccount and a violent feeling of sickness seized her that would have\r\nended in an attack of vomiting had it not passed as quickly as it came.\r\nRaft, who had ceased staring to the west, saw how she was taken and put\r\nhis hand on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"You'll be all right in a bit,\" said he, \"it comes hard at first. I've\r\nseen chaps go clean off their heads sniffin' land after three months of\r\nhell and weather. We'll start in a bit, there's no call to hurry, and\r\nI'll just take a walk to get the stiffness out of my legs.\"\r\n\r\nOff he went, away and away, disappearing beyond a dip in the ground.\r\n\r\nShe knew that he would be away at least half an hour. Thoughtful as a\r\nmother for her comfort, yet almost as outspoken, sometimes, as a nurse,\r\nhe was wonderful.\r\n\r\nThe dawn broke broader and stronger, peaceful and grey, promising a\r\ncontinuance of the fine weather that had now lasted for three days,\r\nthree days without wind or rain or threat from the mountains that sat\r\nthis morning far away and clear cut against the sky.\r\n\r\nThen as they went on their way the sun broke over the edge of the high\r\nlands and gulls rising above the cliff edge flitted like birds born of\r\nsnow and fire.\r\n\r\nThey stopped for ten minutes to breakfast, then they went on, and now\r\nsuddenly came something new. On the wind they could hear the sound of\r\ngulls quarrelling, a sound quite distinct from the ordinary mewing and\r\nwheezing of the gulls at peace.\r\n\r\n\"We're near there,\" said Raft. \"Hark at the gulls, they're fighting over\r\nthe scraps. Them chaps, whoever they are, have been killing seals and\r\nboiling the blubber. The bay's there.\"\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a higher rise in the ground just before them and to the\r\nfact that the land from there sloped down inland at a terrific rate.\r\n\r\nHe was right.\r\n\r\nTen minutes walking brought them to the end of their journey and to the\r\nedge of a cliff two hundred feet high. It was as though a giant had\r\ntaken a gouge and cut a bay right through the sea cliffs. Far across the\r\nwater of the bay before them the land rose again in a precipice steep as\r\nthe one on whose edge they stood.\r\n\r\nThe ripples of the bay washed in on a beach of black pebbles easily\r\nreached by the declivity of the land and on the beach, stewing like\r\nwitches' cauldrons, queer looking try-pots were sending up their smoke.\r\nNear the pots carcases of sea-bulls lay ripped and gory and being\r\ncleared of their blubber by small men, strange-looking, stripped to the\r\nwaist and with arms and chests splashed by blood.\r\n\r\nBut the clove in this devil's mixture was the ship moored in the cliff\r\nshadows, a small ship like a withered kernel in the shell of the bay,\r\nbarque-rigged, antiquated, high pooped, almost with the lines of a junk.\r\nOne might have fancied her designer to have taken for his model some old\r\npicture of the ships of Drake.\r\n\r\nThe try-pots, carcases and busy men left Raft unmoved. The ship held his\r\nwhole mind.\r\n\r\n\"Lord! Look at her,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE SHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nShe had been built on the Chu Kiang in the great Junk building yards\r\nthat lie just below Canton and her bones had been put together by yellow\r\nmen. Built to a European design China had come out in her lines just as\r\nthe curve of the Tartar tent tops still lingers in the roof of the\r\npagoda.\r\n\r\nShe might have been a hundred and fifty tons, not more, maybe less, and\r\nthe junk pattern had been eliminated and European sticks and decent\r\ncanvas substituted for lateen sails by the direction of the man who\r\nordered her and who was a smuggler.\r\n\r\nShe had been built for swiftness as well as cargo and, her builders\r\nhaving been junk builders since the time of Tiberius, she was a failure,\r\nsailing like a dough dish; and the yard that built her, having seen her\r\nfloat off, went on building junks.\r\n\r\nThen she passed from hand to hand, and dirty hands they were, from the\r\nChu Kiang to the Hoang Ho, and through the Korea Channel into the Japan\r\nsea, trading sometimes, smuggling sometimes, and once, as far as the\r\nKuriles, sealing in forbidden waters. She was caught by the Russians\r\nand her crew clubbed to death or sent to the quicksilver mines and then\r\nshe came back to China, somehow, by way of Vladivostok and was sold and\r\nsold again till she fell into the hands of one, Chang, a sea scraper to\r\nwhom everything came in handy from bêche de mer to barratry and murder.\r\n\r\nChang was modern in some of his ideas, he carried a Swenfoyn-harpoon gun\r\nand, having luck down by the Sundas, he collected half a cargo of oil\r\nwhich he sold at Perth; from Perth he had dough-dished along down to\r\nKerguelen after the \"big seals.\" He had struck this bay by chance and he\r\nhad struck oil, for all to westward of it lay a stretch of unwashed\r\nrock, as good a sea elephant ground as that on the long beach.\r\n\r\nThe girl standing beside Raft viewed the scene below her with a catch at\r\nthe heart. The carcases, the little blood-stained busy men, the try-pots\r\nlike witches' cauldrons and that strange-looking ship which even to her\r\neyes seemed not as other ships were, all these had a tinge of nightmare.\r\nAmongst the men she noted one, big almost as Raft. He seemed their\r\nleader.\r\n\r\n\"Chinks,\" said Raft, \"Chinee--they've got their pigtails rolled up,\r\nwell, they're better than nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe picked up the bundle that he had laid down and led the way to the\r\nslope that gave on the beach.\r\n\r\nAs they came on to the upper part of the beach the \"Chinks\" noticed\r\nthem, paused for a second in their labours and then, finding that it\r\nwas only a solitary man and woman, went on with their work as though the\r\nintruders had been a couple of penguins.\r\n\r\n\"Cool lot,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\nThe girl paused. The sight of the carcases and the blood at close\r\nquarters, the absolute indifference of the blubber strippers at the\r\nsight of an obvious pair of castaways, the whole scene and circumstance\r\nturned her soul and chilled her heart.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like this,\" said she. \"Those men make me afraid, they don't\r\nseem human--they are _horrible_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait you here,\" said Raft.\r\n\r\nHe advanced alone across the black shingle and she stood watching him\r\nand listening to the stones crunching beneath his feet.\r\n\r\nHis advance did not disturb the workers.\r\n\r\nThey seemed working against time. Without any manner of doubt they were\r\nanxious to be done with the business and be out of that bay before the\r\nnext blow came, for the place was fully exposed to the west-nor'west and\r\na storm out of there might easily break their ship from its moorings and\r\nsend her broadside on to the shingle.\r\n\r\nUndersized, agile, with weary-old faces that seemed covered with drawn\r\nparchment, they seemed less like men than automata; all save the leader,\r\na gigantic, imperious-looking Mongolian with a thin cat-like moustache,\r\na man of the true river pirate type with a dash of the Mandarin. This\r\nman held in his hand a long thong of leather. Captain or leader, or\r\nwhatever he might be, he was most evidently the serang of that labour\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nOn the shingle where the ripples washed in lay a boat, half-beached.\r\n\r\nThe big man was Chang, and as Raft approached harpoon in hand, she saw\r\nChang draw himself up to his full height and stand waiting. Then she\r\nheard Raft's voice and saw him pointing at her and inland and then at\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\nChang stood dumb. Then all at once he exploded, shouting and\r\ngesticulating. She could not make out what he said, but she knew. He was\r\nordering them off. He seemed to be ordering them off the earth as well\r\nas the beach. And Raft stood there patient and dumb like a chidden\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThen she saw Raft nod his head and turn away.\r\n\r\nHe came back crunching up the shingle. \"Sit down,\" said he.\r\n\r\nShe sat down and he took his seat beside her. He had dropped the bundle\r\njust there, and as he sat for a moment before speaking he noticed that\r\nthe fish line securing the mouth of the sack was loose, he carefully\r\nretied it.\r\n\r\n\"You saw how that chap carried on,\" said he, \"I had to put a stopper on\r\nmyself. He's the chap; them little yellow bellies don't count. He's the\r\nchap, and I've got to get him aside from the others.\" He spoke rapidly\r\nand she saw that his eyes were injected with blood.\r\n\r\nA new fear seized upon her, a fear akin to the dread she had felt that\r\ndark night in the cave when she had caught the sound of La Touche\r\ndragging himself close to her, the dread of imminently impending action.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go away,\" said she, \"another ship may come; anything is better\r\nthan having a fight with those men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got that knife safe?\" asked Raft. She still wore the\r\nfisherman's knife round her waist. She put her hand on it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the knife is safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that chap downs me for good,\" said Raft, \"stick that knife through\r\nyourself. If he doesn't you take my orders and take them sharp.\"\r\n\r\nHe had risen to his feet and without a word more he came down the\r\nshingle again towards the workers, walking in a leisurely way and\r\ntrailing the harpoon along.\r\n\r\nHe approached Chang who turned on him again with the anger of a busy man\r\nimportuned by a beggar. The most heart-sickening thing to the girl was\r\nthe way in which, after the first driving off of Raft, the great\r\nChinaman and his crew had gone on with their work as though they were\r\nalone on the beach. Pity and humanity seemed as remote from that crowd\r\nas from the carcases they were handling. Active hostility would have\r\nbeen less horrible, somehow, than this absolute indifference to the\r\ncondition of others.\r\n\r\nChang did not wait for Raft to speak, this time; he began the speaking,\r\nor, rather, the shouting, advancing on the other who began to retreat.\r\nChang, as if wishing to have done with this matter for good, followed\r\nhim up and at every step the devil in him seemed to rise higher whilst\r\nhis voice filled the beach.\r\n\r\nWhat a voice that was! Half-singing, half-booming, the\r\n\"whant-whong-goom-along\" of the running coolie chanting as he runs\r\nseemed mixed with it, till, his anger breaking bounds, he let fly with\r\nthe strap in his hand, catching the other across the shoulder of the arm\r\nthat held the harpoon.\r\n\r\nThen Raft killed him.\r\n\r\nThe girl who saw the killing was less appalled for the moment by the\r\ndeed than the doer of it. The blow of the harpoon that sent Chang's\r\nbrains flying like the contents of a smashed custard apple was like a\r\nflash of lightning, it was the thunder that terrified.\r\n\r\nRoaring like a sea bull he sprang from the body of Chang towards the\r\ncrowd who faced him for a moment with their flensing knives like a herd\r\nof jackals. The girl, who had sprung to her feet, plucked the knife from\r\nher belt and came running, terror gone and a wind seeming to carry her\r\nover the shingle; zoned in steel blue light she saw the harpoon flying\r\nfrom right to left destroying everything in its way, knives flying into\r\nthe air as if tossed by jugglers, a yellow greasy back into which she\r\nstruck with her knife, a yellow Chinese face falling backwards with eyes\r\nwide on her, as if the Chinese soul of the creature she had stabbed to\r\nthe heart were trying to cling to her.\r\n\r\nThen she was sitting on the shingle very ill and Raft was coming back to\r\nher, running.\r\n\r\nThe fight was over and the beasts had flown, left and right, she could\r\nsee them crawling like ants away up on the higher ground. They had\r\ndropped their knives and the knives were lying here and there on the\r\nshingle where also lay four dead bodies including the body of Chang.\r\n\r\nTen minutes ago there had been fifteen live Chinamen on that beach.\r\n\r\nRaft was bleeding from a cut on the arm, his face was gashed above the\r\nbeard, a knife had ripped his coat and the back of his left hand shewed\r\nanother wound.\r\n\r\nHe was laughing and carrying on like a man in drink and now that her\r\nstomach was relieved an extraordinary light-headedness seized her. Like\r\nRaft, she seemed drunk.\r\n\r\nShe had been snatched for a moment into a world where to kill was the\r\nonly alternative to death or worse than death. For a moment she had\r\nlived in the Stone Age, she had fought like a savage animal and with the\r\nfury of the female, more terrific than the rage of the male. She had\r\nbeen pushed to the edge of things, and it was she who had turned the\r\nfight. The man she had killed was in the act of knifing Raft in the\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"The boat!\" cried Raft.\r\n\r\nShe struggled to her feet, steadied herself, and came to the boat. They\r\npushed it out till it was nearly water borne; she scrambled in, he\r\nfollowed, and pushed off. Out in the bay the high black cliffs rose\r\nabove them as if pushed by a scene shifter, the light-headed laughing\r\nraving feeling left her, and as they came alongside of the barque to\r\nstarboard and tied up to the channel plates she was clear headed and\r\ncalm and able to get on board by the channel without assistance.\r\n\r\nOn the deck she tottered and fell in the dead swoon of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nIt is a long journey to the Stone Age and back and the man or woman who\r\nmakes it is never quite, quite the same again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE OPIUM SMOKERS\r\n\r\n\r\nRaft had never seen a female swoon before. He thought for a moment that\r\nshe had dropped dead and the shock of the business pulled him together\r\nlike a douche of cold water. Then he saw that she was breathing and took\r\nheart, rubbing her hands and poking her in the ribs and calling on her\r\nto pull herself together. He would have been more frightened only that\r\nhe put her condition down to her general unaccountableness in some ways.\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes she had come to and was leaning on her elbow\r\nand declaring herself to be all right. Then she got on her feet and,\r\ntaking her seat on the side of the open hatch, looked about her at the\r\ndingy deck cumbered with a whale boat and all sorts of raffle. The\r\nslight swell of the bay rocked the barque to the creaking tune of block\r\nand cordage, whilst overhead the sea-gulls flitted mewing against the\r\nvast black cliff that rose three hundred feet sheer from the licking\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\"You're all right now?\" said Raft dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I feel quite right and strong again--just a little dizzy, that's\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mind and don't tumble back down that hatch,\" said he, \"I'll drop below\r\nand see what's to be found if you keep your eye out for them Larrikens.\r\nGive me a call if you sight them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Larrikens were nowhere to be seen; they were in the high ground\r\nhidden, and no doubt holding a council of war, but sight or sound of\r\nthem there was none.\r\n\r\nShe nodded and he dropped below into the cabin.\r\n\r\nThe cabin of Chang was clean, almost dainty. Two smaller cabins opened\r\nfrom it, one evidently for Chang and the other for his second in\r\ncommand. Raft in his hurried look round saw a lot of things including a\r\nrack containing six rifles and two heavy revolvers resting on an\r\nammunition box filled with hundreds of cartridges. He opened the\r\nlazarette beneath the cabin flooring; it seemed well-stored, and on a\r\nshelf in the main cabin there were some provisions including a tin of\r\nbiscuits.\r\n\r\nHe brought up the biscuits, the two revolvers and a pocketful of\r\nammunition and, taking his seat on the hatch edge beside the girl,\r\nopened the tin; then he went forward and hunted for water, found the\r\nwater cask and, getting a tin pannikin from the galley, brought her a\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nHe had never loaded or fired a revolver; the girl had, and she shewed\r\nhim how, the echoes of the cliffs answering to the ear splitting reports\r\nas he made a few practice shots, and the guillemots squalling and rising\r\nin clouds from their perches on the rock.\r\n\r\n\"We're fixed all right now,\" said he, \"and we can have those chaps on\r\nboard when they're ready to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"On board!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they'll come right enough, they've got no grub on land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come--but do you mean to say you will let them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who's to work the hooker out of the bay?\" he answered, \"Not you and me.\r\nWe've got to get them aboard. There's no harm in them now they're\r\nlicked.\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke with a knowledge of men absorbed from the whole world over. The\r\nChinese were licked and like dogs they would come to heel. He knew it,\r\nfor he knew men. He had put the fear of God into them, he and the girl;\r\nthe thing was over. Give the \"Chinks\" time to lick their wounds and\r\nswallow their gruel and they would be right as pie. He had seen a whole\r\nship's company licked by a little man of great will, and in hundreds of\r\nexperiences and fights he had found that a beaten man, be he strong as\r\nten, is to be led like a child. He was right. Next morning--they slept\r\non deck that night keeping watch alternately--the \"Chinks,\" hungry and\r\nstarving for a suck at their opium pipes appeared, the whole eleven of\r\nthem, and coming down the beach like a troop of children stood in a\r\nline; then they began to wail.\r\n\r\nWail and wag their heads and wave their hands. Kerguelen, coming on top\r\nof the licking, had broken them to pieces. Then the whole lot kow-towed\r\nlike one man, knees and forehead on the shingle.\r\n\r\nRaft got into the boat and rowed off for the beach bringing them aboard\r\nfour at a time and as each lot reached the deck they kow-towed to the\r\ngirl and then trotted forward to the fo'c'sle, disappearing like rats,\r\ntheir teeth chattering from exposure during the night, stripped to the\r\nwaist as they were, and never could one have imagined these little\r\ncringing harmless looking men the jackals of the day before.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole lot were in the fo'c'sle Raft gave them time to settle,\r\nthen he went down amongst them revolver in pocket. They had lit a lamp,\r\nsome had lit opium pipes and some were lighting them, and they lay about\r\nlike creatures broken with cold and weariness. He nodded to them and\r\nleft them to the opium that would drive the chill from their bones, then\r\ncoming on deck stood beside the girl.\r\n\r\n\"They'll be able to work the ship to-morrow,\" said he, \"told you they'd\r\nbe all right; reckon they won't mind changing that big chap I knocked\r\nout for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't seem to be able to speak a word of English,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I reckon I'll do the steering till we get clear of this place,\"\r\nsaid he, \"they'll handle the sails without knowing English and once\r\nwe're clear we have only to make north till we strike a Christian\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem so harmless,\" she said, \"and when I think of that fight--and\r\nof what I did--\"\r\n\r\n\"You fought fine--damned fine,\" said Raft, \"damned fine.\" He put his arm\r\nround her, not as a man puts his arm round a woman, but as a shipmate\r\nputs his arm round a shipmate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nMAINSAIL HAUL\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night Raft and the girl took it in turns again to keep watch on\r\ndeck. They might just as well have gone below for all the trouble the\r\ncrew could have given them. These gentry had fought bitterly because\r\nthey had been attacked. Raft had frightened them. There is a form of\r\nbravery which one might liken to inverted terror. Rats shew it when they\r\nare cornered, and so do men. They had seen their boss killed with a blow\r\nand the destroyer hurling himself on them and, though they were\r\npeaceable men, they fought. These same peaceable men, be it understood,\r\nwould, all the same, have murdered a human being for profit could they\r\nhave done so with reasonable safety.\r\n\r\nWhen the girl came on deck in the morning, after her watch below, she\r\nfound the deck busy and Raft with his hands in his pockets leaning\r\nagainst the port bulwarks and watching the busy ones.\r\n\r\n\"They're in a thundering hurry to get out,\" said Raft. \"That chap,\"\r\npointing to a \"chink\" that seemed a cut above the others and was\r\nevidently the mate, \"has been pointing to the sky and out there beyond\r\nthe bay. They seem to smell bad weather coming. I nodded my head to him\r\nand he's working the hands now for all they're worth.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wind is blowing from the land,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Raft, \"it'll take us out without towing, unless it changes.\"\r\n\r\nThe hatch cover had been put on and the boat brought to the davits, some\r\nof the crew were up aloft scrambling about like monkeys, others were\r\nmaking ready to haul on the halyards and a fellow was unlashing the\r\nwheel. There was not a face in all the crowd that did not bear the\r\nsignature of Anxiety writ on parchment.\r\n\r\nThe fear of weather, the fear of Kerguelen, and the fear of that bay,\r\nwhich was evidently haunted by evil spirits, drove them like a whip.\r\n\r\nThe mainsail was set to a chorus like the crying of sea fowl and the\r\nforesail and jib. The tide coming in held the barque to a taut anchor\r\nchain with her stern to the beach and the wind ready to take her. The\r\nmate was at the wheel and now from forward ought to have come the sound\r\nof the windlass pawls and the rasp of the rising anchor chain. It\r\ndidn't. From the group of Chinese collected there came, instead, a clang\r\nfollowed by a splash.\r\n\r\n\"Why, the beggars have knocked the shackle off the chain,\" cried Raft.\r\n\"Lord bless _my_ soul, never waited to raise the mud hook?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does it matter?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure to have a spare one,\" answered he, \"but it gets me, that's Chinee\r\nall over, they're rattled.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" she cried, \"we're moving!\"\r\n\r\nThe cliff's were beginning to glide landward and the bay's mouth to\r\nwiden, sea-gulls flew with them screaming a challenge, and the\r\nguillemots lining the cliff ledges broke into voice, echoes and\r\nguillemots storming at them as they went.\r\n\r\nThen the sea opened wide under the grey breezy day and the great islands\r\nshewed themselves away to the east. To the west and the north all was\r\nclear water.\r\n\r\nRaft and the girl walked to the after-rail and looked at the coast they\r\nwere leaving; it seemed horribly near and the great black cliffs only a\r\ngunshot away. If the infernal wind of Kerguelen were to arise and blow\r\nfrom the north even now they might be seized and dashed back on those\r\nrocks, but the south-east wind held steady and the cliffs drew away and\r\nthe coast lengthened and new cliffs and bays disclosed themselves, till\r\nthey almost fancied they could see, away to the east, the great seal\r\nbeach where the remains of the dead man lay in the cave and where the\r\ngreat sea-bulls were without doubt taking their ease on the rocks.\r\n\r\nAnd now came the last call of Kerguelen, the voice of the kittiwakes:\r\n\r\n\"Get-away--get-away--get-away.\"\r\n\r\nRaft, as they stood and watched, put his arm over the shoulder of the\r\ngirl and as she held the great hand that had saved her and brought her\r\nso far towards safety her mind, miles away, kept travelling the long\r\nroad from the caves.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking of the bundle and all the poor things in it,\" said she,\r\n\"it will lie there forever on the beach, waiting to be picked up--it's\r\nstrange.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinkin' the same thing myself,\" said Raft, \"and the old harpoon\r\nI licked that chap across the head with.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nTHE CARCASSONNE\r\n\r\n\r\nRaft had found other things than arms and ammunition in the cabin, he\r\nhad found a box containing nearly three thousand five hundred dollars,\r\npartly in American money and partly in English gold coin. Chang had\r\nstowed it in his chest, a big cedar-wood affair containing all sorts of\r\noddments, including a can of blue label Canton opium, cigars, a couple\r\nof suits of fine silk and a woman's gold bracelet.\r\n\r\nChang had evidently been well-to-do in his way and a man of refinement.\r\nHis bunk bedding was of the finest quality and on a shelf near the bunk\r\nlay piled new-washed sheets and pillow cases. The girl took his cabin\r\nand slept in his bunk. Long ago, in the world that was slowly coming\r\nback to her, the idea of sleeping in the bunk of a Chinaman she had seen\r\nkilled would have revolted her, now, it did not trouble her at all. She\r\nonly knew that a mattress and clean sheets were heaven, even if she had\r\nto sleep with a revolver under her pillow. Then in a day or two she only\r\nput the revolver there as a matter of routine. The \"Chinks\" gave\r\nevidence that so far from making trouble they were extremely anxious to\r\npropitiate and please, and the man who had evidently served Chang\r\nappeared in the cabin tidying things and laying out the food, whilst the\r\nman who had evidently been mate worked the ship in his own weird way\r\nseeming scarcely ever to sleep. He had laid the course almost due north,\r\ntaking the sun with a back-stick that might have come out of the Ark,\r\nworking out his calculations in the fo'c'sle in his own head. Raft did\r\nnot know, he knew nothing of navigation as a science, nor did he care,\r\nthey were going north and day by day drawing into the track of ships,\r\nthat was enough for him.\r\n\r\nOne day the girl said to him: \"Suppose these men make trouble over that\r\nman you killed--and those others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let them,\" said Raft, \"I'll tell my yarn--it's plain enough--I'm not\r\ngoing to tell no lies. The chap tried to drive us off, and we lost and\r\nnear done for, and he hit me a welt on top of all. He got his gruel.\"\r\n\r\nShe had played with the idea of making up a story for the sake of Raft;\r\nshe felt ashamed of the idea when she heard his words.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking of that money down below,\" said he, \"it belonged by rights\r\nto that big chap. If a ship takes us off we'd better hand it over to the\r\nmate or just leave it there for him to take.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we don't want the money,\" she replied, \"I have plenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"You! Where have you got it?\" asked he, looking her over.\r\n\r\n\"In France,\" she replied. Then she laughed. It was the first time she\r\nhad laughed since that day when the sea-bulls had driven the penguins\r\noff, and Raft, as though her mirth were infectious, laughed also.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a joke to him, somehow, the idea of her having money in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe idea of her being one of the Rich People had never worked its way\r\ninto his head. She was just herself, different it is true in some\r\nindefinable way from anyone he had ever met, speaking differently,\r\nacting differently, but made used to his mind by struggle and adversity.\r\nHe scarcely thought of her as a woman, yet he was hugely fond of her, a\r\nfondness that had begun in pity and had been strengthened and made to\r\ngrow by her pluck. He liked to have her near him and when she was out of\r\nsight he felt a bit astray. He never bothered about the future, so the\r\nidea of parting with her had not come to him.\r\n\r\nAnd she? When Raft was out of her sight she felt astray. Her mind had\r\nspun between them a tie, of a new sort in a world grown cynical and old\r\nand cold; an affection permanent as the hills, warm as summer.\r\nEverything good in her loved Raft, it was the affection of a mother for\r\na child, of a child for a mother.\r\n\r\nHe had nursed her back to life, he had brought her life, and never once\r\nsince that day had he chilled her with a littleness or broken a thread\r\nof what was spinning in her heart. He was illiterate, he was rough, but\r\nhe was Raft. He was the great beach of Kerguelen and the sea-bulls and\r\nthe distant islands, he was the hand that had destroyed Loneliness and\r\ndriven away Death, the child who had listened to Jack and the Bean\r\nStalk, the Lion that had destroyed Chang, the companion in a loneliness\r\nringed with despair.\r\n\r\nOne morning beyond the 40th parallel, and some two hundred miles to the\r\nnor'west of St. Paul, the Chinese mate plucked Raft by the sleeve and\r\npointed into the west.\r\n\r\nThe day was clear with a wind just enough to fill the sails of the\r\nbarque and a long blue leisurely swell running from the south. Away in\r\nthe east was a trace of smoke as though a grimy finger had stained the\r\nsky just above the sea-line.\r\n\r\n\"Ship,\" said the mate.\r\n\r\nIt was the one word of English that he knew. Raft was about to shout and\r\nrun to the cabin hatch to call the girl. Then he held himself back. It\r\nmight be a false hope. Yet if he had thought he might have known that a\r\nship in the east meant a ship right across their course, here, where\r\nthere were no trade tracks north and south.\r\n\r\nThen above the sea-line and clear of smoke he saw her hull.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the halyards and the mate understood. The mate was\r\nevidently desperately anxious to be quit for good of his self-invited\r\npassengers, for when Raft came on deck again with the girl they found\r\nthe barque under bare poles rolling to the swell and a Chinese flag\r\nhalf-masted flicking in the wind.\r\n\r\nAlso, away across the sea, sheering towards them and making to cross\r\ntheir bows a mile away a two funnelled steamer whose funnels closed to\r\none as she shifted her helm to get within speaking distance of them.\r\n\r\nShe was the _Carcassonne_, a seven thousand ton freighter carrying\r\npassengers, a French boat, bound from Sydney to Cape Town and\r\nMarseilles.\r\n\r\nRaft, the day before, had taken the Chinese mate down to the cabin and\r\nshewed him Chang's money and had presented it to him and the crew in\r\npantomime.\r\n\r\nIt was honesty. It was also a good stroke. There was no trouble when the\r\n_Carcassonne_, her huge bulk rolling gently to the swell, dropped a\r\nboat, though indeed had the companions of Chang wished to raise trouble\r\nthey would have found themselves seriously handicapped, dumb as they\r\nwere in every language but their own.\r\n\r\nChang had been their linguist as well as their leader. They had\r\nliterally lost their tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nMARSEILLES\r\n\r\n\r\nOn board the _Carcassonne_ the girl had broken down as though all the\r\nexhaustion she had defied had waited for that moment to fall upon her.\r\n\r\nBut the energy that had held her above defeat and had given her hope\r\nwhen things seemed hopeless was there, undestroyed, and when the turning\r\npoint came she rallied swiftly. She came on deck one morning where\r\nBathurst lay a point invisible beyond the blue sea to starboard and\r\nsitting in a deck chair made friends with the other passengers.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her almost impossible that the same world should hold\r\nKerguelen and at the same time this paradise of azure blue sky and tepid\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nRaft had told her story before reaching Cape Town and the loss of the\r\n_Gaston de Paris_ was now old news in Europe, and the fact that of all\r\nthe _Gaston's_ crowd only the beautiful Cléo de Bromsart had been saved.\r\n\r\nRaft had joined the crew of the _Carcassonne_, sleeping in the foc's'le,\r\nwhere there were several English speaking sailors, and as much out of\r\nhis element as a man used only to masts and spars can be on a\r\nsteamboat. However, he swabbed decks and did odd jobs without a grumble\r\nand he was swabbing the deck on the morning she came up; he dropped the\r\nbusiness for a moment to take the two hands she held out to him.\r\n\r\nAll through that time below she had been wanting Raft and his big hand\r\nto pull her through. Satisfied, knowing he was on board and all right,\r\nbut wanting him all the same.\r\n\r\nOn the old barque once or twice had come the stray thought of how Raft's\r\nfigure would accommodate itself against the background of the world she\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nWell, here was the world she knew, or part of it; a deck, clean as a\r\nball-room floor and as spacious, passengers in deck chairs, reading\r\nnovels, and a manicured French surgeon ready to talk art or philosophy\r\nto her, polished, but rather narrow of shoulder.\r\n\r\nAnd against all that stood Raft, rough and in the clothes he had worn on\r\nthe beach, for there was not a man on board whose clothes would have\r\nfitted him comfortably.\r\n\r\nWell, he was not incongruous with this background, simply because he\r\ndestroyed it. In a ball-room it would have been the same. He carried\r\nwith him his background of high black cliffs and miles of beach and\r\nflying gulls and breaking sea, and in a flash came to her the fact that\r\nhe dwarfed and belittled the other people around just as nature dwarfs\r\nand belittles art.\r\n\r\nShe held both his hands for a moment, managing to pat them, somehow, as\r\nshe held them, asking him what on earth he was doing with the swab he\r\nhad just dropped. She had an idea that the ship people had put him to\r\nwork, but before the idea had risen to indignation heat he reassured\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I must be doing,\" said Raft. \"Not that there's much to be at in this\r\nold kettle. You've got your legs back, well, that's good. I had it out\r\nwith that doctor chap and he told me how you were going from day to day,\r\nbut I've been wanting the sight of you.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his hand on her shoulder as he might on a pal's, then he crossed\r\nhis arms. \"And well you look,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Petit,\" said the girl, speaking in French, \"this is Raft, the\r\nbravest and best man in the world as you will know when I tell you all.\r\nShake hands with him.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor shook hands.\r\n\r\nThe passengers, and the first officer, across the bridge canvas, watched\r\nall this with curiosity. They knew something but they did not know all.\r\nThey did that night when she had told them as best she could.\r\n\r\nAfter that she met him often on deck, giving him a word or stopping for\r\na chat, and it was now that she began to think and make plans as to the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nRaft had become part of herself, they were bound together as perhaps no\r\ntwo such contrary beings had ever been bound. The idea of Love, the idea\r\nof Marriage, all conventional ideas as between grown-ups of opposite sex\r\nwere as absurd in relation to them as they would have been in relation\r\nto two children who had grown attached one to the other.\r\n\r\nAs regarded one another they were in fact two children, for Raft had\r\nnever been anything but a child and Kerguelen and Raft combined had\r\nawakened the primitive and the child in her, giving her the power of\r\naffection that makes a little child throw its arm round the neck of a\r\ndog.\r\n\r\nBut the world could not understand that, and Raft to the world was a\r\nrough sailor man, and she, to the world, was Cléo de Bromsart.\r\n\r\nShe would lie awake at night listening to the pounding of the screws and\r\nthinking of this--contrasting the figure of Raft with the world she knew\r\nand the world she knew with the figure of Raft.\r\n\r\nMadame de Brie, her nearest relation, would pass before her mind's eye\r\nwith her gold eye glasses, and the Comtesse de Mirandole and a host of\r\nothers; and the queer thing was that the vaguest feeling of antagonism\r\ntinged her mind towards these estimable people. They seemed forgeries,\r\nimpudent forgeries of the handwriting that had first written the word\r\nMan on the earth. She had seen the original writing.\r\n\r\nShe felt also towards them the antagonism of the child to the grown up,\r\nand of the person who can't explain to the person who stands waiting\r\nfor an explanation.\r\n\r\nThen she would laugh quietly to herself, for no woman, surely, was ever\r\nin a similar position. Then, casting her mind back, she would sometimes\r\nchoke a little with tears in her throat, tears for herself, dying of\r\nloneliness, and for the hand that had brought her back from death.\r\n\r\nThey passed the entrance of the straits and Gibraltar, and one bright\r\nblue winter's morning they entered the harbour of Marseilles, with\r\nMarseilles before them blazing in the sun and the bugles of Fort St.\r\nJean answering the crying of the gulls and the drums of Fort St.\r\nNicholas.\r\n\r\nCléo was dressed in the same clothes she had worn on her escape from the\r\n_Gaston de Paris_. She had borrowed a hat from one of the ladies on\r\nboard and stockings and other things from another lady; but she still\r\nwore round her waist the leather belt with the empty knife sheath.\r\n\r\nAs she stood on deck, now, waiting whilst the _Carcassonne_ berthed at\r\nthe wharf alongside a great Messagerie steamer, she carried over her arm\r\nthe oilskin coat and, by its elastic band, the sou'wester. They were old\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThen when the hawsers had been passed and the gang plank was being run\r\nout she saw amongst the crowd on the wharf Monsieur de Brie and Madame\r\nde Brie, also a number of well-dressed people, Parisians some of them.\r\n\r\nThen she was being embraced by Madame de Brie and trying at the same\r\ntime to acknowledge the salute of Monsieur Bonvalot, her lawyer and man\r\nof affairs, a stout pale man with long Dundreary whiskers who had come\r\nfrom Paris to receive her.\r\n\r\nAll this crowd had not come purely on account of Cléo. Beside the people\r\ninterested in her there were several friends and relations of Prince\r\nSelm, also his lawyer.\r\n\r\n\"I have taken rooms at the Hotel Noailles,\" said Madame de Brie, \"and I\r\nhave brought you some clothes. Oh, my poor child, what you must have\r\nsuffered. But why did the people on board not lend you some better\r\nthings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my clothes are all right,\" said Cléo, \"people wanted to lend me\r\nthings, but I am quite comfortable in these.\"\r\n\r\nShe was looking about in search of Raft who was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nThen she was seized by the rest, by the Comtesse de Mirandole, by Madame\r\nde Florey, and several others who had stopped at Marseilles--on their\r\nway to Monte Carlo--to meet the _Carcassonne_ and greet the girl who had\r\nalone survived the wreck of the _Gaston de Paris_, some of these people\r\nknew her only slightly, but once a person becomes famous or notorious it\r\nis astonishing how slight acquaintanceship blossoms into full\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nSeveral photographers from the illustrated papers were amongst the crowd\r\nand a Pathé operator was on the quay.\r\n\r\nCléo was already recovering that sixth sense, which one might call the\r\nsocial sense, and, as she talked almost to half a dozen people at once,\r\nanswering questions and receiving felicitations, this sixth sense told\r\nher quite plainly that she was being criticised by her felicitators,\r\nthat in their eyes she was a guy. That the old velour hat she had\r\nborrowed, the hair that shewed beneath it, her face, which had still\r\nupon it a reflection of Kerguelen, her old skirt and coat--all these\r\nthings, singly and taken together, were exciting in the minds of these\r\nParisians a pity which was not unrelated to humour. She did not mind,\r\nshe was looking for Raft.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her that all these people, excellent in their way, had a\r\ntinge of unreality about them. On the voyage she had sometimes vaguely\r\ndreaded that Raft might be pushed away from her, despite herself, by the\r\ncontrast between him and her own order. It had come to her that the\r\ndifference between the beach of Kerguelen and the Avenue Malakoff might\r\ntake her like a giant of mind and divorce her from her allegiance to\r\nhim. That the good companion, the true friend, the person she loved\r\nmight alter completely under the touch of social alchemy.\r\n\r\nRaft was impossible. She knew that. More impossible even than a sea\r\nelephant from that far beach where life was real and Paris a dream.\r\nImpossible in Paris where life was false and the far beach a dream.\r\n\r\nRaft at a dinner party! Raft at one of those elegant afternoons where\r\nthe talk would run on the politics of the moment, on symbolism, on\r\nBergson, or Iturrino or the works of Othon Friesz--! He could not be her\r\ncompanion in that place, in that atmosphere, within leagues of those\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nShe was not thinking that now. \"These people\" around her seemed\r\nstrangers; they had in fact always been strangers, strangers who had\r\nkissed her, conversed with her, dined with her, but strangers; the one,\r\ntrue, living, warm friend, the only one she had ever known, was Raft. It\r\nwas the penguins and sea-bulls over again, the polite, bowing,\r\nabsolutely correct penguins, the warm lumping, living sea-bulls.\r\n\r\nHer heart, chilled by stephanotis-scented kisses, words of felicitation\r\nand the fat smiles of men in tall hats and tight-buttoned overcoats,\r\nchilled by Monsieur de Brie's gold rimmed eye glasses, chilled by a\r\nsocial state that had never warmed her, cried out for Raft. Kerguelen\r\nand that beach, where, even now, the sea-bulls might be lingering,\r\nseemed a warm and blissful vision, real, alive, a place where life meant\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nAh, here he came. He had been helping to fix a hawser at the bows. She\r\nran towards him.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there you are. Now, you are coming with me. I have told the captain\r\nand he said this morning it would be all right as you were not signed\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" said Raft, \"but where are you going?\"\r\n\r\n\"To an hotel.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked about him. He saw the crowd on deck but he did not connect it\r\nwith her. He was out of his reckoning. He had never thought of what\r\nwould happen in port as regarded her, or where he would go or what he\r\nwould do; making plans was not in his way. In the ordinary course of\r\nthings he would have gone to the British consulate and the Shipwrecked\r\nMariners' people would have returned him, carriage paid, to England. He\r\nhad always been in the hands of others and of chance.\r\n\r\nShe--he had always called her She, and here, be it said, he did not know\r\nher name, never having asked--She had now taken him into her hands and\r\nhe felt vaguely that she was a power on this new beach where he was\r\nstranded.\r\n\r\nHad you told him that she was a woman of society and very wealthy his\r\nidea of her power would not have been increased; he knew nothing of\r\nwealth or society. She was She in her old dress that he knew so well,\r\nand still carrying the sou'wester he had fetched from the cave where she\r\nhad done that chap in, and as for any idea of being under an obligation\r\nto her for food or housing he had none. He would have done the same for\r\nher.\r\n\r\nYet, to tell the truth, the docks, with no money in his pocket and the\r\ncold prospect of brilliant Marseilles, had made him feel adrift like a\r\nlost child. Civilisation had affected him as it had affected her, so\r\nthat something, now, made him put his hand on her shoulder to get the\r\ntouch of her, and she, knowing that every eye in all that party behind\r\nher was upon them, took the great hand and held it and patted it.\r\n\r\nIt was as well to take her stand at once, though she was scarcely\r\nbothering about that. Then, still holding his hand, she came along that\r\nwhite deck towards the gang-plank. The officers knew and, as they bade\r\nher good-bye, they nodded to Raft, but the Parisians knew nothing but\r\nthat Cléo had gone clearly mad--and that that awful sailor had placed\r\nhis hand on her shoulder, familiarly!\r\n\r\nThere were several automobiles waiting by the wharf and Madame de Brie,\r\nhalf-dumb and slightly agitated, having pointed out the car she had\r\nreserved for Cléo, the girl introduced Raft.\r\n\r\n\"This is Raft who saved my life,\" said Cléo.\r\n\r\nThen she took Raft by the arm and pushed him into the seat beside the\r\nchauffeur; having done that, she got into the car, following Madame de\r\nBrie. The Comtesse de Mirandole got in, also, followed by Monsieur de\r\nBrie and his gold eye glasses.\r\n\r\nThe mistral was blowing so that the windows of the car had to be kept\r\nclosed.\r\n\r\nUsed to fresh air, the girl nearly choked at first with the stuffiness\r\nof the car. The olfactory nerve is really a prolongation of the brain,\r\nas though the brain, distrusting the other senses, had pushed out a\r\ntrustworthy scout to see what the world and its contents were really\r\nlike. The sense of smell never lies; it is of all senses the truest and\r\nit handed along without comment to the brain of Cléo the faint perfume\r\nof the stephanotis affected by Madame de Brie and of the Yoya-yoya\r\naffected by the Comtesse de Mirandole, also traces from the varnish and\r\nupholstery of the car.\r\n\r\n\"Who, my dear, is that man,\" asked Madame de Brie. She had almost said\r\n\"that dreadful man\" but she had checked herself.\r\n\r\n\"Man--Oh, that is Raft. He saved my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"How delightful,\" said the Countess, \"and he seems quite a character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite,\" said Madame de Brie half-heartedly, \"but my dear Cléo, you will\r\nexcuse an old woman for suggesting it, your generosity must be on its\r\nguard, he placed his hand on your shoulder, quite familiarly it seemed\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the choking Cléo, \"why should he not? I have slept with my\r\nhead on his chest on a rock and I have stabbed a man who was trying to\r\nkill him. Between us we fought a whole crowd of Chinamen. He had a\r\nharpoon and I had a knife and we beat them and took their ship. Do you\r\nmind having the window a wee bit open? I feel rather faint.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's better,\" said she to the speechless other ones, \"I'm so used to\r\nfresh air that I can't bear to be closed in.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my dear Cléo,\" suddenly broke out the old lady, \"what do you intend\r\nto do with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do with him? Nothing. He's my friend, that's all. Ah, here we are.\"\r\n\r\nThe car had drawn up in the courtyard of the Hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LEPER\r\n\r\n\r\nDéjeuner had been prepared for the party in a private room, a big room,\r\nfor there were twelve guests all told, including not only Cléo's friends\r\nbut the business men, and the friends of Prince Selm.\r\n\r\nBut before thinking of déjeuner or anything else she had to see about\r\nRaft.\r\n\r\nShe left him standing in the hall whilst she interviewed the manager.\r\n\r\nActually, the business would have been easier for her had she brought\r\nwith her an animal, even of the largest pattern. The manager, when he\r\nhad caught a glimpse of the intended guest, revolted; not openly, it is\r\ntrue, but with genuflexions and outstretching of hands.\r\n\r\nWhere could this man be put, what could be done with him? The valets and\r\nladies' maids would certainly not eat with him, the visitors would\r\nobject to his presence in the lounge, the servants in the servants'\r\nquarters. He was a common sailor man. Heavens! What a problem that\r\nmanager had to face, something quite new, quite illogical, yet quite\r\nlogical. He had heard of the wreck of the _Gaston_ and he was as\r\ninterested in Clêo as a hotel manager could be. He understood the whole\r\ncase when she told him that Raft had saved her life; he was a man of\r\nbroad mind, but he knew intimately the mental make up of his servants,\r\nhis visitors and their servants. He discussed the matter with Cléo quite\r\nopenly and she saw the reason of all he said. Raft was \"impossible\" in\r\nthat hotel. His heroism did not count a bit; it did with the manager who\r\nwould not have to sit at table with him, it did not with the waiters and\r\nvalets and ladies' maids who would have to associate with him, or the\r\nguests whose eyes would be offended by his presence.\r\n\r\n\"He belongs to a ship,\" said the manager. Then he solved the question\r\nwith a burst.\r\n\r\n\"I will look after him myself.\" He ran into the hall and called Raft to\r\ncome with him; then, followed by Cléo, he led the way to a sitting-room,\r\na most elegant sitting-room upholstered in blue silk.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he to the sea lion, \"will you take your seat and déjeuner\r\nwill be served to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have to leave you for a bit,\" said Cléo, putting her hand on his arm,\r\n\"I won't be long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll wait for you,\" said Raft. He was a bit amazed at all the new\r\nthings around him and blissfully unconscious of trouble. He threw his\r\ncap on a chair and took his pipe from his pocket, the same old pipe he\r\nhad lit that night on the ledge of the sea-corridor, then he produced a\r\nplug of tobacco, the same tobacco whose pungent fume had comforted her\r\nthere, with the sound of the hungry sea coming through the dark.\r\n\r\nThen he sat down on a silk covered chair and the manager and the girl\r\nwent out.\r\n\r\n\"I will serve him myself,\" said the manager. \"I understand; he is a\r\nbrave man but very rough; the servants do not understand these things.\r\nIt is a difficulty, but after--? Mademoiselle--after?\"\r\n\r\n\"After what?\"\r\n\r\n\"After he has had his meal?\"\r\n\r\nShe understood. After he had been fed he was to go. He could go, say, to\r\na sailors' lodging house; she had heard of such things. Or, he would\r\nwalk about the streets; the thing was quite simple. It was only right to\r\ngive him a good meal and some money, a good round sum, seeing all he had\r\ndone for her.\r\n\r\nShe was scarcely heeding the manager. She was viewing, full face, the\r\ntruth that the manager had demonstrated to her clearly. Raft was\r\nimpossible. She had had vague ideas of bringing him to Paris and giving\r\nhim a room for himself in her house on the Avenue Malakoff. She had\r\nnever thought of the servants, she had thought of her friends and that\r\nthey would think her conduct queer. But she saw everything now quite\r\nstraight and in a dry light. Raft was shipwrecked on a social state; to\r\nkeep company with him she would have to renounce everything and live on\r\nhis level; she could not treat him as a servant; even if she could,\r\nservants would resent him. He was not of their type, much lower, a\r\nlabouring man from the sea. Not to lose him as he was to her she would\r\nhave to enter the absolutely impossible and absurd, she would have to\r\ngive up social life and make a world of her own with Raft. With a man\r\nwhose setting was the sea, the wilderness, whose life was action, who\r\nwas ignorant of art, philosophy, the convenances, who was a figure of\r\nscorn to every educated eye when caught against the background of\r\nCivilisation.\r\n\r\nIn three beats of a pendulum all this passed through her mind.\r\n\r\nThen she said to the manager:\r\n\r\n\"Quite so. I understand. I must thank you very much for your real\r\nkindness. I shall give this man a sum of money, and this afternoon you\r\nwill be free of him. He can find shelter at a sailors' home--I have\r\nheard of such places.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mon Dieu! Yes,\" said the manager, vastly relieved, \"and either I or\r\nFritz, my head waiter, will serve him with his food. Fritz is a man of\r\ntemperament and knowledge and I will explain to him.\"\r\n\r\nHe hurried off and she was left alone in the corridor.\r\n\r\nShe opened the door of the little sitting-room. The leper was seated\r\nhunched on his chair just as she had seen him sitting often on a rock;\r\nhe was surrounded with a cloud of tobacco smoke.\r\n\r\nShe had seen the loneliness of Kerguelen but that was nothing to this.\r\n\r\nPoor Raft. The very chairs and tables shouted at him; he looked\r\nridiculous. How in her wildest dreams could she have entertained the\r\nidea of holding him to her, here?\r\n\r\nHe would have looked more ridiculous only that he looked, what he felt,\r\nforlorn. The place was beginning to tell on him, used to the rough and\r\nthe open; the smooth and the closed were getting at him.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw her he took the pipe from his mouth and pressed the burning\r\ntobacco down with his finger nervously, the same finger she had sucked\r\nonce when parched with thirst.\r\n\r\nShe saw, as a matter of fact, that he was nervous, if the term could\r\napply to such a huge and powerful organism, and the fear came to her\r\nthat if left alone he might bolt before she could conduct him in person\r\nto the Sailors' Home.\r\n\r\nStanding with the door held half open she nodded to him.\r\n\r\n\"I want you to stay here,\" said she, \"till I come back. I have to talk\r\nto all those people you saw and I may be a couple of hours. That man\r\nwill bring you something to eat--you don't mind my leaving you here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't mind,\" said Raft \"but you'll be wanting something to eat\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll come back, sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed, nodded to him, and closed the door. Her cheeks were\r\nflushed and her eyes bright, she was strangely worked up; a touch might\r\nhave sent her into a storm of anger or a burst of tears.\r\n\r\nIn the corridor she met Madame de Brie who had been hunting for her.\r\n\r\n\"Cléo, they are waiting déjeuner for you--but, my dear child, you have\r\nnot changed, has no one shewn you to your room?\"\r\n\r\nThe old lady had not only brought along Cléo's maid who, with the rest\r\nof the servants, had been on board wages during her mistress's absence,\r\nbut a trunk full of clothes.\r\n\r\n\"I am not going to change,\" said Cléo, \"I am too busy--and too hungry--\"\r\n\r\nA reporter from the _Gaulois_ stopped her as she was turning towards the\r\nroom, indicated by Madame de Brie, where déjeuner was to be served.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said the reporter, \"I did not like to trouble you\r\nsooner, may I crave the honour of a short interview with you on account\r\nof the _Gaulois_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, monsieur,\" replied the girl. \"Pray come to déjeuner as my\r\nguest, I hope to tell my friends something of my experiences and what I\r\nsay you can repeat; that will be better than a formal interview\r\ntête-à-téte, which, after all, is rather a depressing affair.\"\r\n\r\nThe déjeuner was not a depressing affair. Cléo struck the note. She was\r\nin radiant good humour. Madame de Brie sat on her right, Monsieur de\r\nBrie on her left. Monsieur Bonvalot, her man of affairs, with his long\r\nDundreary whiskers, opposite to her; the rest were scattered on either\r\nside of the long table.\r\n\r\nAt first the conversation was general, then, after a while, Cléo was\r\ntalking and the rest listening.\r\n\r\n\"As I shall be very busy for a long time,\" said Cléo, \"I would like now\r\nto give all the information I can about the loss of the yacht. A\r\ngentleman is present on behalf of the _Gaulois_, and as all details I\r\ncan give relative to the disaster are of world wide interest,\r\nconsidering the position of the late Prince Selm, I take this\r\nopportunity of making them known. Unfortunately they are few.\"\r\n\r\nShe told briefly but clearly the story of the disaster, of her escape\r\nand landing on Kerguelen, of the caves and the cache and the death of\r\nthe two men. She did not tell how La Touche met his end, that business\r\nhad to do with no one but herself and La Touche. She gave it to be\r\nunderstood that he, like Bompard, had met his fate in the quicksands.\r\n\r\nShe told of her loneliness, and how she had been dying simply from\r\nloneliness, how she had been saved by Raft and how he had nursed her\r\nlike a mother.\r\n\r\nIt was then that she really began to talk and shew them pictures. They\r\nsaw the beach and that terrible journey along under the cliffs, cliffs\r\nthat seemed cut out of night and never ending, the sea, like an\r\nobsession, crawling shoreward, and Raft carrying her on his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThey saw the summit where she had stood looking towards the west and the\r\nhopeless prospect of finding a bay that might not be there and an\r\nanchorage where there might be a ship, on a coast where few ships ever\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nFascinated and warmed by Perrier Jouet, they followed her to the place\r\nwhere the wind had brought her the smell of the try pots and to the\r\ncliff edge where Derision shew her the Chinese whaler and the terrible\r\nlittle man, blood-stained, and busy with butchery.\r\n\r\nShe shewed them the great serang--Captain of the Chinese--driving them\r\noff the beach and telling them to begone back into the wilderness, and,\r\nvaguely, the fight where Raft had saved her from death or worse----\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mon Dieu, what a man,\" cried a female voice down the table.\r\n\r\nCléo stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Madame la Comtesse,\" said she, \"but a man beyond the pale, a man\r\nto be ashamed of, a man who, were he to sit in the lounge of this hotel\r\nand smoke his pipe, would drive all the other guests away. A common\r\nsailor. A man rough from the sea and illiterate.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a dead silence.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Bonvalot, a socialist, though a business man, nodded his head.\r\nHe broke the silence.\r\n\r\n\"A man,\" said Monsieur Bonvalot, \"is, after all, a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, monsieur, he is not,\" said Cléo, \"not in Marseilles. But do\r\nnot think I am quarrelling with social conditions. There must, I\r\nbelieve, always be hewers of wood and drawers of water. I am just\r\ntalking of Raft and my own position as regards him. I am not thinking of\r\nthe fact that he saved my life time and again, or that he nursed me with\r\nhis great rough hands as tenderly as a mother. I am thinking of the fact\r\nthat I have discovered something quite new and genuine, a human heart\r\nthat is warm and real and true and simple, simple as the heart of a\r\nchild, a mind that has no crookedness, a man who, in Paris or here in\r\nMarseilles, is absurd, not because he is rough and uncouth, but because\r\nhe is like Monsieur Gulliver amongst the little people. I have seen the\r\ngreat, I have seen the wind and the sun and the sea and the mountains as\r\nthey really are, and life as it really is, for those who really live. I\r\nhave seen death, none of you here have ever seen or imagined death, none\r\nof you here have ever seen life, none of you here have seen the world.\r\nYou all have been protected from the truth of things, and fortunately,\r\nfor the truth of things would break you as it would have broken me but\r\nfor Raft, who sits in a room at the end of that corridor and whom the\r\nmanager of this hotel is serving with food with his own hands because\r\nthe hotel servants would consider it an insult were they asked to carry\r\nhim his food.\r\n\r\n\"I am not grumbling. I quite recognise the logic of the whole thing, but\r\nI feel as though I were looking at everything through the large end of a\r\npair of opera glasses, just as when as a child I used to do so and\r\namuse myself by watching human beings reduced to the size of dolls.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now you have all my story and I have put before you a new view of\r\nthings and I hope I have not shocked you all. My poor Raft must now go\r\nto the Sailors' Home where I am going with him. I want some money,\r\nMonsieur Bonvalot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle,\" said Bonvalot, awaking like a person from hypnotism and\r\ndelighted to find himself on a business footing again, \"certainly, I\r\nhave here your cheque book which I have brought with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we will go to another room and discuss business matters,\" said the\r\ngirl rising. \"Now all you people please enjoy yourselves. You are my\r\nguests whilst you stay in this hotel. Madame de Brie will see that you\r\nhave everything.\"\r\n\r\nShe led the way from the room, Monsieur Bonvalot following. A suite had\r\nbeen engaged for her and here in the sitting-room she started to talk\r\nbusiness with her man of affairs.\r\n\r\nA large fortune is like a delicate animal, always in need of nursing and\r\nattention, it is always changing colour in spots from rosy to dark, a\r\ndepreciation in Peruvian bonds means that your capital has shrunk just\r\nthere and the question comes will it go on shrinking; a big rise in\r\nP.L.M. shares suggests taking the profit and re-investing should they\r\nfall again.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Bonvalot had problems of this sort to set before the girl--she\r\nswept them away. \"I have no time to attend to all that now,\" said she,\r\n\"some other day will do. I want twenty thousand francs, have you got\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty thousand francs,\" said Bonvalot. \"No, Mademoiselle. I brought\r\nfive thousand francs in notes thinking you would want them for your\r\nexpenses here, but you can write a cheque on the Crédit Lyonnais and I\r\nwill get it cashed for you at once.\"\r\n\r\nHe produced from a wallet a bundle of pink and blue bank notes and\r\ncounted out five thousand francs, then she wrote a cheque for fifteen\r\nthousand payable to him. He endorsed it, went off and returned in ten\r\nminutes with the money. She put the notes in a big envelope and the\r\nenvelope in her pocket. That same pocket still contained the old tobacco\r\nbox of Captain Slocum and the other odds and ends which she treasured\r\nmore than gold.\r\n\r\n\"That will do for the present,\" said she, \"to-morrow I will open an\r\naccount at the Marseilles branch of the Crédit Lyonnais, or rather you\r\ncan do it for me to-day. Give them this specimen of my signature and\r\nthey can telegraph to the Paris branch. I would like two hundred\r\nthousand francs put to my credit here.\r\n\r\n\"But are you not coming back to Paris?\" asked Bonvalot.\r\n\r\n\"No, Monsieur Bonvalot, not at present!\" He pulled his whiskers.\r\n\r\nThe idea had suddenly come to him, and come to him strongly, that she\r\nwas about to do \"something foolish.\"\r\n\r\nHe had seen women do very foolish things in the course of his business\r\nlife and all that talk of hers at the luncheon table came back to him\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nHe remembered the beautiful Mademoiselle de Lacy who had run off and\r\nmarried a groom; could it be possible that Cléo contemplated any such\r\nmad act with that terrific sailor man? The idea chilled his heart.\r\n\r\nEquality and Fraternity were parts of his motto and he was an honest\r\nsocialist; he believed honestly that all men were equals and that the\r\nwaiters who served him at table were as good as himself, with a\r\ndifference of course due to the accidents of life, but he believed, with\r\nDaudet, that there is no greater abyss than class difference.\r\n\r\nHis theory was confounded by this practice. But he could say nothing,\r\nfor the matter was too delicate to be touched upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nA NEW HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nRaft was still in the room where she had left him. As they passed\r\nthrough the hall where a number of people were seated about in basket\r\nchairs she felt every eye fixed upon her and her companion. Then out in\r\nthe sunlit Cannabier Prolongué she drew a deep breath just as a person\r\ndraws a deep breath after a dive.\r\n\r\nShe also felt free.\r\n\r\nShe had always been free in theory; possessed of her own money she could\r\nhave done absolutely as she liked, in theory. In practice she had always\r\nbeen a slave. The slave of a thousand and one things and circumstances,\r\nthings and circumstances many of them troublesome, many of them\r\nwearisome, all of them not to be denied.\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle, your bath is ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mademoiselle, the first gong has sounded.\"\r\n\r\n\"What dress will Mademoiselle wear this afternoon?\"\r\n\r\nOh, the day, the day with its hundred phases and divisions, the dresses\r\nthat went with each phase, the lukewarm emotions and interests and\r\nboredom and suppressed hatreds, this thing called the day, which she had\r\nfirst reviewed in the open boat after the wreck of the _Gaston de\r\nParis_ terrified to find it torn from her--this thing had been returned\r\nto her that morning in all its futility. It seemed to her, as she cast\r\nit away, a horrible gaud, a thing made of tinsel, yet a thing that could\r\ndestroy the soul and blind the eyes and numb the heart.\r\n\r\nShe had never been free, she had always been the veriest slave, the\r\nslave of things, of people, of convenances, and of circumstances.\r\n\r\nDoctor Epinard had spoken something of the truth.\r\n\r\nMan may not be an automaton worked by environment, all the same he is\r\nthe slave of environment, and never such a slave as when his environment\r\nis that of high Civilisation.\r\n\r\nFor there the pure motives of the mind have ever to be regulated and\r\nfalsified, the heart crushed, the face veiled.\r\n\r\nTo break with all that falsity means shipwreck.\r\n\r\n\"Which way does the sea lie?\" asked the girl. Raft turned to the left as\r\nthough the smell of the sea were leading him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to be out of there,\" said he, \"I was near smothered in that\r\nplace.\"\r\n\r\n\"So was I,\" said she, \"did that man bring you your food all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Another chap brought it,\" said Raft, \"a Dutchman.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what I was thinking?\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of the time you brought me food when I was nearly dying.\r\nYou didn't tell a Dutchman to bring it. I'd have brought you your food\r\nmyself and we would have had it together only I had to talk to those\r\npeople. Well, I've got rid of them. How would you like to live always in\r\na place like that hotel?\"\r\n\r\nRaft mentally reviewed the room done in blue silk, Fritz, and the rest\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather be out in the open,\" said Raft. \"Not that I have anything to\r\nsay against it--but I'd rather be out in the open.\"\r\n\r\nThey walked along.\r\n\r\nCompanionship with Raft had for her one delightful thing about it, it\r\nwas companionship without restraint. In a way it was like companionship\r\nwith a dog, or a child. Like two old sailors they would hang silent,\r\nsometimes, for a long time, not bothering to speak, content with being\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nShe had never imagined the possibility of a man and a woman of\r\nabsolutely different social position in such a relationship, never drawn\r\nthe ghost of such an idea from all the books she had read, all the plays\r\nshe had seen. Never could she have imagined a common sailor man striking\r\nArt for her to pieces, as he had struck the story of Anatole France, and\r\ncreating above a world he had taught her to despise, a nest for her mind\r\nrough as himself, but in air pure and living.\r\n\r\nRaft, the common man, had made her social world seem vulgar as well as\r\nsmall, chill as well as vulgar.\r\n\r\nShe was thinking just now as she walked beside him how when she had told\r\nhim that the hotel manager would bring him something to eat, he had\r\nsaid, \"but you will want something to eat yourself.\" That was the sort\r\nof thing constantly recurring in all sorts of ways that had brought her\r\nto know him truly, occurring in little ways as well as in that great and\r\nheroic moment when he had told her to destroy herself with the knife if\r\nhe were killed.\r\n\r\nAs they passed along the Cannabier they saw a drunken sailor reeling\r\nalong towards them through the crowd, and Raft drew her by the arm off\r\nthe sidewalk to avoid him.\r\n\r\nThe sight in other times would have made him laugh, or more likely it\r\nwould have been scarcely noticed, but She, in some manner or another,\r\nmade drink discreditable, and the sight of it to be avoided. It would\r\nhave been the same, most likely, had he been taking a child for a walk.\r\nDown near the docks they passed a birdshop before which Raft cast anchor\r\nalmost forgetful of his companion. There were all sorts of birds here,\r\nthose tiny birds from the African coast one sees in the shops of the\r\nRiviera, canaries and parrots.\r\n\r\nThere was one parrot, enormous and coloured like a tropical sunset,\r\ndrowsy-eyed and insolent looking. When he saw the sailor man he seemed\r\nto rouse up. He looked at Raft and Raft at him.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like that chap,\" said Raft, \"he beats the lot of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you shall have him,\" said she.\r\n\r\nHe laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Much good he'd be to a chap like me. Where'd I keep him?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes softened as she looked at the bird and from the bird to the\r\nman. Where, indeed, could he keep him? He who had no home--nothing. Then\r\nit was that Money seemed to her what it really is, a god, beautiful and\r\nbenign.\r\n\r\nIt had often seemed to her as a demon, but Raft, who unconsciously had\r\ncast ridicule on her world, was now, unconsciously, shewing her the\r\ngreat truth she had never seen before, the truth that Money is more\r\nbeautiful than Apollo, more etherial than Psyche, more powerful than\r\nJove.\r\n\r\n\"You will soon have somewhere to keep him,\" said she, \"we will get him\r\nto-morrow. Come on. I want now to find the place where the fishing boats\r\nput in. I saw it the last time I was here in Marseilles, years ago, but\r\nI am not sure of the direction.\"\r\n\r\nShe asked a man who was passing and he pointed the way; it was a long\r\ndistance, but it seemed short, so full was her mind with the plan she\r\nhad formulated before leaving the hotel. She talked as she went. Talked\r\njust as though they were on the Kerguelen beach hunting for a cave.\r\n\r\n\"We will find a place to put the parrot. I want a great big boat, not a\r\nyacht. I've had enough of those. I want a good sea boat and the\r\nfisher-boats I have seen here seemed to me good, and the men are the\r\nright sort of men. I am going to buy one--or hire one--well, we shall\r\nsee. I want you to help to get it ready for us. How good the smell of\r\nthis place is,\" she paused to sniff the tar-sea scents brought by the\r\nafternoon wind. It was like the smell of Freedom.\r\n\r\nThen they came on to the fisher wharf and right into the arms of Captain\r\nJean Bontemps.\r\n\r\nCaptain Jean was about five feet in height and he seemed five feet in\r\nthickness. He was propped against a bollard and he was in his\r\nshore-going clothes. The girl's eye told her at once that here was a\r\nuseful man, a man of authority and knowledge. She approached him, and as\r\nhe took his pipe from his mouth and removed his cap, she opened her\r\nbusiness without parley or hesitation.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to buy or hire a fishing boat, price no object.\r\n\r\nHe did not understand her at first. He seemed suffering from some form\r\nof deafness. Then when she repeated the statement he shewed no surprise.\r\n\r\nHe himself was a fishing boat owner, Captain Bontemps of the\r\n_Arlesienne_, and he was quite willing to sell his boat, for a sum--two\r\nthousand pounds he asked, and she did not know that he was speaking in\r\njest, just as one might speak to a child.\r\n\r\n\"If your boat suits me, I will pay what you ask,\" said she, \"let me see\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThen it came upon Captain Jean that he was either talking to a lunatic\r\nor some wealthy woman with a craze. His sails were taken aback and he\r\nwas left wallowing in a heavy ground sea of the mind with a smell of\r\nspice islands tinging the air.\r\n\r\n_La Belle Arlesienne_, his old boat, was not worth a thousand pounds.\r\nUnder the hammer heaven knows what she would have fetched, but she was\r\nhis wife, or the only female thing that stood in that relationship to\r\nhim. He tapped the dottle out of his pipe, then he took a pouch from his\r\npocket and began to refill and the girl, seeing his condition, drew him\r\naside, asking Raft to wait for her.\r\n\r\nThey went to another bollard and there, the mariner anchoring himself,\r\nshe began to talk. She introduced herself. He knew all about the _Gaston\r\nde Paris_ and Mademoiselle de Bromsart. He put his pipe in his pocket,\r\nfinding himself in such famous company. She went on. In ten minutes she\r\ntold him her whole story, told him just what Raft was and just how they\r\nstood related, and just how he had been treated in the hotel.\r\n\r\n\"It's as though they had turned out my father or my brother,\" said she,\r\n\"we two who have fought and faced everything together have grown into\r\ncompanions. Friends who cannot be parted, Captain Bontemps. If he were a\r\nwoman or I a man it would be easier. As it is things are difficult.\r\nWell, I do not care. I will do exactly as I like. I feel you will be my\r\nfriend, too; you understand me. And I want you to look after him\r\nto-night, for in the whole of Marseilles I do not know where he could go\r\nunless to some wretched Sailors' Home or worse. Ah, it is wicked. Of\r\nwhat use is it to be brave, to be honest, to be true in this world?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu,\" said the Captain, \"I will look after him, if for no other\r\nreason than that he is what you say, mademoiselle; but _La Belle\r\nArlesienne_ is rough, should you use her as a yacht, you would not find\r\nher a yacht. She smells of fish--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am used to rough things,\" said the girl. \"I dread the smooth. Captain\r\nBontemps, for one who has done for me everything should I dread\r\nanything? And a little roughness, what is that to freedom and the life I\r\nhave learned to love with the man I love? For I love Raft, Captain\r\nBontemps, just as I know he loves me. Oh, do not mistake me, it is not\r\nthe sort of thing they call love here amongst houses and streets, it is\r\nnot a woman that is speaking to you but a human being.\"\r\n\r\nHe understood her. To his broad and simple mind the thing was simple;\r\nshe did not want to part with the man who had saved her and fought for\r\nher and who had been \"chucked out\" of a hotel because he was a rough\r\nsailor, and marvellously well he understood that when she said she loved\r\nRaft she did not mean the thing that the dock side called Love. No Paris\r\npoet could have understood her. The old fisher captain did.\r\n\r\nBut he was a practical man. He struck himself a blow on the head.\r\n\r\n\"I have what you want,\" said he, \"_La Belle Arlesienne_, no, it is no\r\nuse, I have something better, a good cruising boat--you say money is no\r\nobject.\"\r\n\r\n\"None.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come with me, you two.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way followed by Raft and the girl to a wharf where a tug lay\r\nmoored and by the tug a fifty ton yawl.\r\n\r\n\"There's your boat,\" said Bontemps, \"built by Pinoli of Genoa for an\r\nAmerican. She has even a bath-room--a main cabin with two cabins off it,\r\nyour man could berth in the fo'c'sle which is big enough for twenty like\r\nhim. Follow me.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way on to the deck of the yawl.\r\n\r\nThe girl went over it down below into the main cabin with two little\r\nsleeping cabins off it. She peeped into the tiny bath-room, examined the\r\npantry well-stored with crockeryware, there was everything even to the\r\nbunk bedding, sheets and towels, she went to the fo'c'sle; compared with\r\nthe fo'c'sle of the _Albatross_ it was a little palace.\r\n\r\nThen she turned to Raft.\r\n\r\n\"This is your new home,\" said she, \"there is room for your parrot here.\"\r\nThen turning to Captain Bontemps. \"Well, that is settled and now I only\r\nwant a crew and a captain--fishermen. I will have no yachtsmen on my\r\nboat. I have had to do with yachtsmen, Captain Bontemps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my faith,\" said the old fellow, \"you will easily find a crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but I won't easily find a captain. I want you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain laughed.\r\n\r\n\"And how about _La Belle Arlesienne_?\" asked he.\r\n\r\n\"You must leave her behind you to be sold. In my service money is no\r\nobject. Now as to this boat, who is the agent from whom I can buy her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Latour and Company,\" replied the old fellow, for the first time in his\r\nlife in the powerful grip of wealth and not knowing exactly whether the\r\ngreat golden hand was holding him heels or head up.\r\n\r\n\"How far is Latour's from here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not far.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl stood for a moment looking round her at the white deck, the\r\nmasts, the rigging, and as she looked some hand seemed to draw aside a\r\nveil revealing the stupid immovable houses of the land filled with\r\nstupid immovable people bound and tied up by soul-killing\r\nconventions--and on the other hand the old mystery of ships, those homes\r\nof Freedom on the road that has no boundaries.\r\n\r\nThen she turned to Bontemps.\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" said she, \"let us go to Latour's.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Cléo,\" said the distracted Madame de Brie, writing to a friend, \"Cléo\r\nmust always have been as mad as her aunt De Warens. Fishermen, it\r\nseems, are the only honest people, and she and her cargo of fishermen,\r\nwith an old man named Bontemps, are now heaven knows where since I met\r\nthem at Portofino.\r\n\r\n\"She calls them her children and when I last saw her she was coming\r\nalong the little quay at Portofino helping that big red bearded man to\r\ncarry provisions.\r\n\r\n\"The times are revolutionary, that's the truth, and women are not what\r\nthey were, and I am old, I suppose, and cannot see things as I ought to\r\nsee them--and the grief is she might have married any one, she might\r\nhave married Royalty itself, and I told her so and she laughed in my\r\nface. She said she never intended to marry any one, that she already had\r\na family of 'children' and that the great bearded man Raft was the\r\nsmallest of them all, that she was teaching him to read and write and to\r\ntalk French so that he could converse with the rest of her family.\r\n\r\n\"She has made Portofino her headquarters, it seems, and she is the lady\r\nbountiful of the fishing folk there, sits in their cottages and talks to\r\nthem, taking up her quarters at the little _auberge_ and sometimes\r\nliving on board her boat.\r\n\r\n\"A strange life, and yet she seems happy, like that poor Mademoiselle La\r\nFontaine, whom I last saw at the Maison de Santé of Doctor\r\nSchwanthaller, seated with a straw crown on her head and imagining\r\nherself a queen.\"\r\n\r\nThere ended the letter of Madame de Brie, and here ends the story of\r\nCléo de Bromsart, a woman of energy and mind who learned from Kerguelen\r\nthat Life is an endless striving, not a peaceful drifting, and that of\r\nall things high the highest is the soul of a child.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Beach of Dreams, by H.
