Cushing Co.--Berwick & Smith Co.\r\nNorwood, Mass., U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventy-nine books on grapes enrich the pomology of North America, not\r\ncounting numerous state and national publications. Pomological writers\r\nin America have been partial to the grape, for other fruits do not\r\nfare nearly so well. Twenty-two books are devoted to the strawberry,\r\nfourteen to the apple, to the peach nine, cranberry eight, plum five,\r\npear nine, quince two, loganberry one, while the cherry, raspberry,\r\nand blackberry are not once separated from other fruits in special\r\nbooks. Thus, though a comparative newcomer among the fruits of the\r\ncountry, the grape has been singled out for a treatise more times than\r\nall other fruits of temperate climates combined--seventy-nine books on\r\nthe grape, seventy on all other fruits.\r\n\r\nThis statement of partiality does not lead to an apology for a new\r\nbook on the grape. There is urgent need for a new book. But three of\r\nthe seventy-nine treatises on this fruit are contemporary, and all but\r\none, a handbook on training, are records from vanished minds. Methods\r\nchange so rapidly and varieties multiply so fast, that to keep pace\r\nthere must be new books on fruits every few years. Besides, the types\r\nof grapes are so diverse, and different soils, climates, and\r\ntreatments produce such widely dissimilar results, that many books are\r\nrequired to do justice to this fruit--the vineyard should be seen\r\nthrough many eyes.\r\n\r\nCommercial grape-growing is now a great industry in America, and\r\ndeserves a treatise or its own. But there are also many demands for\r\ninformation on grape-growing by those who grow fruits for pleasure,\r\nespecially by those who are escaping from cities to suburban homes,\r\nfor the grape is a favorite fruit of the amateur. And so, though\r\nPleasure and Profit are a hard team to drive together, this manual is\r\nwritten for both commercial and amateur grape-growers.\r\n\r\nIn particular, the needs of the amateur are recognized in the chapter\r\non varieties, where many sorts are described which have little or no\r\ncommercial value. No other fruit offers the enchantment of novelty to\r\nbe found in the grape. Alluring flavors, sizes, and colors abound, of\r\nwhich the amateur wants samples. The commercial grower who plants but\r\none variety often finds himself dissatisfied with the humdrum of the\r\nbusiness. He should emulate the amateur and plant more kinds, if only\r\nfor pleasure, remembering the adage, \"No profit grows where is no\r\npleasure ta'en.\" Greater pleasure in grape-growing, then, is offered\r\nas the justification of the long chapter on varieties.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of too broad spreading, the author discusses, in a book\r\nmainly devoted to native grapes, the culture of European grapes in the\r\nfar West. The chief aim is, of course, to set forth information that\r\nwill be helpful to growers of these grapes in the western states,\r\nthere being no treatises to which western growers can refer, other\r\nthan bulletins from state and national agricultural institutions.\r\nThere is, however, another reason for attempting to cover the whole\r\nfield of grape-growing in America. It is certain that eastern\r\ngrape-growers will sometime grow European grapes. Western vineyards\r\nmight well be enlarged with plantings of native grapes. On the\r\nsupposition, then, that the culture of both European and native grapes\r\nis to become less and less restricted in America, the author has\r\nventured to discuss the culture of all grapes for all parts of North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this manual, the author's \"The Grapes of New\r\nYork,\" a book long out of print and never widely distributed, has been\r\nlaid under heavy contribution, especially in the description of\r\nvarieties.

But, more particularly, the materials, the events and the men\r\nwho direct the work of domestication are of interest to those who\r\nbreed and care for animals and plants; the grape-grower should find\r\nmuch profit in the story of the domestication of the grape. What was\r\nthe raw material of a fruit known since the beginning of agriculture\r\nand wherever temperate fruits are grown? How has this material been\r\nfashioned into use? Who were the originative and who the directive\r\nagents? These are fundamental questions in the improvement of the\r\ngrape, answers to which will also throw much light on the culture of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nBotanists number from forty to sixty species of grapes in the world.\r\nThese are widely distributed in the northern hemisphere, all but a few\r\nbeing found in temperate countries. Thus, more than half of the named\r\nspecies come from the United States and Canada, while nearly all of\r\nthe others are from China and Japan, with but one species certainly\r\ngrowing wild in southwestern Asia and bordering parts of Europe. All\r\ntrue grapes have more or less edible fruits, and of the twenty or more\r\nspecies grown in the New World more than half have been or are being\r\ndomesticated. Of the Old World grapes, only one species is cultivated\r\nfor fruit, but this, of all grapes, is of greatest economic importance\r\nand, therefore, deserves first consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EUROPEAN GRAPE\r\n\r\nThe European grape, _Vitis vinifera_ (Fig. 1), is the grape of ancient\r\nand modern agriculture. It is the vine which Noah planted after the\r\nDeluge; the vine of Israel and of the Promised Land; the vine of the\r\nparables in the New Testament. It is the grape and the vine of the\r\nmyths, fables, poetry and prose of all peoples. It is the grape from\r\nwhich the wines of the world are made. From it come the raisins of the\r\nworld. It is the chief agricultural crop of southern Europe and\r\nnorthern Africa and of vast regions in other parts of the world,\r\nhaving followed civilized man from place to place in all temperate\r\nclimates. The European grape has so impressed itself on the human mind\r\nthat when one thinks or speaks of the grape, or of the vine, it is\r\nthis Old World species, the vine of antiquity, that presents itself.\r\n\r\nThe written records of the cultivation of the European grape go back\r\nfive or six thousand years. The ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians, Greeks\r\nand Romans grew the vine and made wine from its fruit. Grape seeds\r\nhave been found in the remains of European peoples of prehistoric\r\ntimes, showing that primitive men enlivened their scanty fare with\r\nwild grapes. Cultivation of the grape in the Old World probably began\r\nin the region about the Caspian Sea where the vine has always run\r\nwild. We have proof of the great antiquity of the grape in Egypt, for\r\nits seeds are found entombed with the oldest mummies. Probably the\r\nPhoenicians, the earliest navigators on the Mediterranean, carried the\r\ngrape from Egypt and Syria to Greece, Rome and other countries\r\nbordering on this sea. The domestication of the grape was far advanced\r\nin Christ's time, for Pliny, writing then, describes ninety-one kinds\r\nof grapes and fifty kinds of wine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. A shoot of _Vitis vinifera_.]\r\n\r\nIt can never be known exactly when the European grape came under\r\ncultivation. There is no word as to what were the methods and\r\nprocesses of domestication, and whose the minds and hands that\r\nremodeled the wild grape of Europe into the grape of the vineyards.\r\nThe Old World grape was domesticated long before the faint traditions\r\nwhich have been transmitted to our day could possibly have arisen. For\r\nknowledge of how wild species of this fruit have been and may be\r\nbrought under cultivation, we must turn to New World records.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN GRAPES\r\n\r\nFew other plants in the New World grow wild under such varied\r\nconditions and over such extended areas as the grape. Wild grapes are\r\nfound in the warmer parts of New Brunswick; on the shores of the Great\r\nLakes; everywhere in the woodlands of the North and Middle Atlantic\r\nstates; on the limestone soils of Kentucky, Tennessee and the\r\nVirginias; and they thrive in the sandy woods, sea plains and\r\nreef-keys of the South Atlantic and Gulf states. While not so common\r\nwest of the Mississippi, yet some kind of wild grape is found from\r\nNorth Dakota to Texas; grapes grow on the mountains and in the cañons\r\nof all the Rocky Mountain states; and several species thrive on the\r\nMexican borders and in the far Southwest.\r\n\r\nWhile it is possible that all American grapes have descended from an\r\noriginal species, the types are now as diverse as the regions they\r\ninhabit. The wild grapes of the forests have long slender trunks and\r\nbranches, whereby their leaves are better exposed to the sunlight. Two\r\nshrubby species do not attain a greater height than four or five feet;\r\nthese grow in sandy soils, or among rocks exposed to sun and air.\r\nAnother runs on the ground and bears foliage almost evergreen. The\r\nstem of one species attains a diameter of a foot, bearing its foliage\r\nin a great canopy. From this giant form the species vary to slender,\r\ngraceful, climbing vines. Wild grapes are as varied in climatic\r\nadaptations as in structure of vine and grow luxuriantly in every\r\ncondition of heat or cold, wetness or dryness, capable of supporting\r\nfruit-culture in America. So many of the kinds have horticultural\r\npossibilities that it seems certain that some grape can be\r\ndomesticated in all of the agricultural regions of the country, their\r\nnatural plasticity indicating, even if it were not known from\r\nexperience, that all can be domesticated.\r\n\r\nLeif the Lucky, the first European to visit America, if the Icelandic\r\nrecords are true, christened the new land Wineland. It has been\r\nsupposed that this designation was given for the grapes, but recent\r\ninvestigations show that the fruits were probably mountain\r\ncranberries. Captain John Hawkins, who visited the Spanish settlements\r\nin Florida in 1565, mentions wild grapes among the resources of the\r\nNew World. Amadas and Barlowe, sent out by Raleigh in 1584, describe\r\nthe coasts of the Carolinas as, \"so full of grapes that in all the\r\nworld like abundance cannot be found.\" Captain John Smith, writing in\r\n1606, describes the grapes of Virginia and recommends the culture of\r\nthe vine as an industry for the newly founded colony. Few, indeed, are\r\nthe explorers of the Atlantic seaboard who do not mention grapes among\r\nthe plants of the country. Yet none saw intrinsic value in these wild\r\nvines. To the Europeans, the grapes of the Old World alone were worth\r\ncultivating, and the vines growing everywhere in America only\r\nsuggested that the grape they had known across the sea might be grown\r\nin the new home.\r\n\r\nThat American viticulture must depend on the native species for its\r\nvarieties began to be recognized at the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when several large companies engaged in growing foreign\r\ngrapes failed, and a meritorious native grape made its appearance. The\r\nvine of promise was a variety known as the Alexander. Thomas\r\nJefferson, ever alert for the agricultural welfare of the nation,\r\nwriting in 1809 to John Adlum, one of the first experimenters with an\r\nAmerican species, voiced the sentiment of grape experimenters in\r\nspeaking of the Alexander: \"I think it will be well to push the\r\nculture of this grape without losing time and efforts in the search\r\nof foreign vines, which it will take centuries to adapt to our soil\r\nand climate.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. A shoot of _Vitis Labrusca_.]\r\n\r\nAlexander is an offshoot of the common fox-grape, _Vitis Labrusca_\r\n(Fig. 2), found in the woods on the Atlantic coast from Maine to\r\nGeorgia and occasionally in the Mississippi Valley. The history of the\r\nvariety dates back to before the Revolutionary War, when, according\r\nto William Bartram, the Quaker botanist, it was found growing in the\r\nvicinity of Philadelphia, by John Alexander, gardener to Governor Penn\r\nof Pennsylvania. Curiously enough, it came into general cultivation\r\nthrough the deception of a nurseryman. Peter Legaux, a French-American\r\ngrape-grower, in 1801 sold the Kentucky Vineyard Society fifteen\r\nhundred grape cuttings which he said had been taken from an European\r\ngrape introduced from the Cape of Good Hope, therefore called the\r\n\"Cape\" grape. Legaux's grape turned out to be the Alexander. In the\r\nnew home the spurious Cape grew wonderfully well and as the knowledge\r\nof its fruitfulness in Kentucky, Ohio and Indiana spread, demand for\r\nit increased, and with remarkable rapidity, considering the time, it\r\ncame into general cultivation in the parts of the United States then\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\n_The Labrusca or fox-grapes._\r\n\r\nOf the several species of American grapes now under cultivation, the\r\nLabrusca, first represented by the Alexander, has furnished more\r\ncultivated varieties than all the other American species together, no\r\nless than five hundred of its varieties having been grown in the\r\nvineyards of the country. There are several reasons why it is the most\r\ngenerally cultivated species. It is native to the parts of the United\r\nStates in which agriculture soonest advanced to a state where fruits\r\nwere desired. In the wild, the Labruscas are the most attractive,\r\nbeing largest and handsomest in color; among all grapes it alone shows\r\nblack-, white- and red-fruited forms on wild vines. There is a\r\nnorthern and a southern form of the species, and its varieties are,\r\ntherefore, widely adapted to climates and to soils. The flavor of the\r\nfruits of this species, all things considered, is rather better than\r\nthat of any other of our wild grapes, though the skins in most of its\r\nvarieties have a peculiar aroma, somewhat pronounced in the well-known\r\nConcord, Niagara and Worden, which is disagreeable to tastes\r\naccustomed to the pure flavors of the European grapes. All Labruscas\r\nsubmit well to vineyard operations and are vigorous, hardy and\r\nproductive, though they are more subject to the dreaded phylloxera\r\nthan are most of the other cultivated native species. Of the many\r\ngrapes of this type, at least two deserve brief historical mention.\r\n\r\nCatawba, probably a pure-bred Labrusca, the first American grape of\r\ncommercial importance, is the most interesting variety of its species.\r\nThe origin of the variety is not certainly known, but all evidence\r\npoints to its having been found about the year 1800 on the banks of\r\nthe Catawba River, North Carolina. It was introduced into general\r\ncultivation by Major John Adlum, soldier of the Revolution, judge,\r\nsurveyor and author of the first American book on grapes. Adlum\r\nmaintained an experimental vineyard in the District of Columbia,\r\nwhence in 1823 he began the distribution of the Catawba. At that time\r\nthe center of American grape culture was about Cincinnati, and an\r\nearly shipment of Adlum's Catawbas went to Nicholas Longworth of that\r\ncity and was by him distributed throughout the grape-growing centers\r\nof the country. As one of the first to test new varieties of American\r\ngrapes, to grow them largely and to make wine commercially from them,\r\nNicholas Longworth is known as the \"father of American grape culture.\"\r\n\r\nCatawba is still one of the four leading varieties in the vineyards of\r\neastern America. The characters whereby its high place is maintained\r\namong grapes are: Great elasticity of constitution, by reason of which\r\nthe vine is adapted to many environments; rich flavor, long-keeping\r\nquality, and handsome appearance of fruit, qualities which make it a\r\nvery good dessert grape; high sugar-content and a rich flavor of\r\njuice, so that from its fruit is made a very good wine and a very good\r\ngrape-juice; and vigor, hardiness and productiveness of vine. The\r\ncharacters of Catawba are readily transmissible, and it has many\r\npure-bred or hybrid offspring which more or less resemble it.\r\n\r\nThe second commercial grape of importance in American viticulture is\r\nConcord, which came from the seed of a wild grape planted in the fall\r\nof 1843 by Ephraim W. Bull, Concord, Massachusetts. The new variety\r\nwas disseminated in the spring of 1854, and from the time of its\r\nintroduction the spread of its culture was phenomenal. By 1860 it was\r\nthe leading grape in America and it so remains. Concord furnishes,\r\nwith the varieties that have sprung from it, seventy-five per cent of\r\nthe grapes grown in eastern America. The characters which distinguish\r\nthe vine are: Adaptability to various soils, fruitfulness, hardiness\r\nand resistance to diseases and insects. The fruits are distinguished\r\nby certainty of maturity, attractive appearance, good but not high\r\nflavor, and by the fact that they may be produced so cheaply that no\r\nother grape can compete with this variety in the markets. Concord is,\r\nas Horace Greeley well denominated it in awarding the Greeley prize\r\nfor the best American grape, \"the grape for the millions.\"\r\n\r\nThe histories of these two grapes are typical of those of five hundred\r\nor more other Labruscas. Out of a prodigious number of native\r\nseedlings, an occasional one is found greatly to excel its fellows and\r\nis brought under cultivation.\r\n\r\n_The Rotundifolia or Muscadine grapes._\r\n\r\nLong before the northern Labruscas had attained prominence in the\r\nvineyards of the North, a grape had been domesticated partially in the\r\nSouth. It is _Vitis rotundifolia_ (Fig. 3), a species which runs riot\r\nfrom the Potomac to the Gulf, thriving in many diverse soils, but\r\ngrowing only in the southern climate and preferring the seacoast.\r\nRotundifolia grapes have been cultivated somewhat for fruit or\r\nornament from the earliest colonial times. It is certain that wine was\r\nmade from this species by the English settlers at Jamestown. Vines of\r\nit are now to be found on arbors, in gardens or half wild on fences\r\nin nearly every farm in the South Atlantic states. That the\r\nRotundifolias have not been more generally brought under cultivation\r\nis due to the bountifulness of the wild vines, which has obviated the\r\nnecessity of domesticating them. The fruit of its varieties, to a\r\npalate unaccustomed to them, is not very acceptable, having a musky\r\nflavor and odor and a sweet, juicy pulp, which is lacking in\r\nsprightliness. Many, however, acquire a taste for these grapes and\r\nfind them pleasant eating. The great defect of this grape is that the\r\nberries part from the pedicels as they ripen and perfect bunches\r\ncannot be secured. In fact, the crop is often harvested by shaking the\r\nvines so that the berries drop on sheets beneath. Despite these\r\ndefects, a score or more varieties of this species are now under\r\ngeneral cultivation in the cotton-belt, and interest in their\r\ndomestication is now greater than in any other species, with great\r\npromise for the future.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. A shoot of _Vitis rotundifolia_.]\r\n\r\n_The Æstivalis or summer-grapes._\r\n\r\nThe South has another grape of remarkable horticultural possibilities.\r\nThis is _Vitis æstivalis_ (Fig. 4), the summer-grape or, to\r\ndistinguish it from the Rotundifolias, the bunch-grape of southern\r\nforests. There are now a score or more well-known varieties of this\r\nspecies, the best known being Norton, which probably originated with\r\nDr. D. N. Norton, Richmond, Virginia, in the early part of the\r\nnineteenth century. The berries of the true Æstivalis grapes are too\r\nsmall, too destitute of pulp and too tart to make good dessert fruits,\r\nbut from them are made our best native red wines. Domestication of\r\nthis species has been greatly retarded by a peculiarity of the species\r\nwhich hinders its propagation. Grapes are best propagated from\r\ncuttings, but this species is not easily reproduced by this means and\r\nthe difficulty of securing good young vines has been a serious\r\nhandicap in its culture.\r\n\r\nThere are two subspecies of _Vitis æstivalis_ which promise much for\r\nAmerican viticulture. _Vitis æstivalis Bourquiniana_, known only under\r\ncultivation and of very doubtful botanical standing, furnishes\r\nAmerican viticulture several valuable varieties. Chief of these is the\r\nDelaware, the introduction of which sixty years ago from the town of\r\nDelaware, Ohio, raised the standard in quality of New World grapes to\r\nthat of Old World. No European grape has a richer or more delicate\r\nflavor, or a more pleasing aroma, than Delaware. While a northern\r\ngrape, it can be grown in the South, and thrives under so many\r\ndifferent climatic and soil conditions and under all is so fruitful,\r\nthat, next to the Concord, it is the most popular American grape for\r\ngarden and vineyard. Without question, however, Delaware contains a\r\ntrace of European blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. A shoot of _Vitis æstivalis_.]\r\n\r\nAnother offshoot of this subspecies is Herbemont, which, in the South,\r\nholds the same rank that Concord holds in the North. The variety is\r\ngrown only south of the Ohio, and in this great region it is esteemed\r\nby all for a dessert grape and for its light red wine. It is one of\r\nthe few American varieties which finds favor in France, being\r\ncultivated in southwest France as a wine-grape. Its history goes back\r\nto a colony of French Huguenots in Georgia before the Revolutionary\r\nWar. Very similar to Herbemont is Lenoir, also with a history tracing\r\nback to the French in the Carolinas or Georgia in the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe other subspecies of _Vitis æstivalis_ is _Vitis æstivalis\r\nLincecumii_, the post-oak grape of Texas and of the southern part of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley. Recently this wild grape has been brought\r\nunder domestication, and from it has been bred a number of most\r\npromising varieties for hot and dry regions.\r\n\r\n_The Vulpina or river-bank grapes._\r\n\r\nThe North, too, has a wine-grape from which wines nearly equaling\r\nthose of the southern Æstivalis are made. This is _Vitis vulpina_ (_V.\r\nriparia_), the river-bank grape, a shoot of which is shown in Fig. 5,\r\nthe most widely distributed of any of the native species. It grows as\r\nfar north as Quebec, south to the Gulf of Mexico and from the Atlantic\r\nto the Rocky Mountains. Fully a century ago, a wine-grape of this\r\nspecies was cultivated under the name Worthington, but the attention\r\nof vineyardists was not turned to the Vulpinas until after the middle\r\nof the last century, when the qualities of its vines attracted the\r\nattention of French viticulturists. Phylloxera had been introduced\r\nfrom America into France and threatened the existence of French\r\nvineyards. After trying all possible remedies for the scourge, it was\r\ndiscovered that the insect could be overcome by grafting European\r\ngrapes on American vines resistant to phylloxera. A trial of the\r\npromising species of New World grapes showed that vines of this\r\nspecies were best suited for the reconstruction of French vineyards,\r\nthe vines being not only resistant to the phylloxera but also vigorous\r\nand hardy. At present, a large proportion of the vines of Europe,\r\nCalifornia and other grape-growing regions are grafted on the roots of\r\nthis or of other American species, and the viticulture of the world\r\nis thus largely dependent on these grapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. A shoot of _Vitis vulpina_.]\r\n\r\nThe French found that a number of the Vulpina (Riparia) grapes\r\nintroduced for their roots were valuable as direct producers for\r\nwines. The fruits of this species are too small and too sour for\r\ndessert, but they are free from the disagreeable tastes and aromas of\r\nsome of our native grapes and, therefore, make very good wines. The\r\nbest known of the varieties of this species is the Clinton, which is\r\ngenerally thought to have originated in the yard of Dr. Noyes, of\r\nHamilton College, Clinton, New York, about 1820. It is, however,\r\nprobably the Worthington, of which the origin is unknown, renamed.\r\nThere are possibly a hundred or more grapes now under cultivation\r\nwholly or in part from Vulpina, most of them hybrids with the American\r\nLabrusca and the European Vinifera, with both of which it hybridizes\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\n_Domesticated species of minor importance._\r\n\r\nIn the preceding paragraphs we have seen that four species of grapes\r\nconstitute the foundation of American viticulture. Nine other species\r\nfurnish pure-bred varieties and many hybrids with the four chief\r\nspecies or among themselves. These are _V. rupestris_, _V. Longii_,\r\n_V. Champinii_, _V. Munsoniana_, _V. cordifolia_, _V. candicans_, _V.\r\nbicolor_, _V. monticola_ and _V. Berlandieri_. Several of these nine\r\nspecies are of value in the vineyard or for stocks upon which to graft\r\nother grapes. The domestication of all of these is just begun, and\r\neach year sees them more and more in use in the vineyards of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.--Two views of vineyards in California. _Top_,\r\na vineyard in the orchard region of central California; _bottom_, a\r\nvineyard in southern California.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nGRAPE REGIONS AND THEIR DETERMINANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nHappily, the grape in its great diversity of forms accommodates itself\r\nto many conditions, so that some variety of the several cultivated\r\nspecies will produce fruit for home use, if not as a market commodity,\r\nin every part of America adapted to general agriculture. But\r\ncommercial grape-growing on this continent is confined to a few\r\nregions, in each of which it is profitable only in ideal situations.\r\nIn fact, few other agricultural industries are more definitely\r\ndetermined by environment than the grape-industry. Where are the grape\r\nregions of America? What determines the suitability of a region for\r\ngrape-growing? Answers to these questions furnish clews to the culture\r\nof this fruit and help in estimating the potentialities of a new\r\nregion or of a location for grape-growing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAPE REGIONS OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nThere are four chief grape-growing regions in North America, with\r\npossibly twice as many more subsidiary ones. These several regions,\r\neach of which has its distinct varieties and to less extent distinct\r\nspecies, and in each of which grapes are grown for somewhat widely\r\ndifferent purposes, give a great variety of industrial conditions to\r\nthe grape-growing of the continent. Nevertheless, the regions have\r\nmuch in common in their environment. It is from their differences and\r\nsimilarities that most can be learned in the brief discussions of the\r\nregions that follow.\r\n\r\n_The Pacific slope._\r\n\r\nThe Pacific slope takes precedence among the grape regions of the\r\ncontinent, exceeding all others combined in the production of grapes\r\nand grape products. California is the viticultural center of this\r\ngreat region, grapes being grown within her bounds from the foot of\r\nMount Shasta on the north to Mexico on the south and from the\r\nfoothills of the Sierras on the east to the forest that borders the\r\ncoast on the west. So outlined, California might appear to be one vast\r\nvineyard, but it is only in favored valleys, plains and low hills in\r\nthe territory bounded that the vine is sufficiently well suited to be\r\nproductive. Outliers of this main region of the Pacific slope run\r\nnorth into Oregon, Washington, Idaho and even into British Columbia,\r\nforced more and more eastward the farther north to escape humidity\r\nfrom the ocean which northward passes farther and farther inland.\r\nOther outliers of the main region are found eastward in Nevada,\r\nArizona, New Mexico and even Utah and Colorado, though for the most\r\npart in these states grape-growing is still insignificant. Plate I\r\nshows typical vineyards in California.\r\n\r\nThe grapes grown on the Pacific slope are almost exclusively Vinifera\r\nvarieties, though a few American grapes are planted in the Pacific\r\nNorthwest. This is not because American varieties cannot be grown,\r\nalthough they succeed rather less well here than on the eastern\r\nseaboard, but because the Viniferas are liked better, and climate and\r\nsoil seem exactly to suit them. Viticulture on the Pacific slope is\r\ndivided into three interdependent industries which are almost never\r\nquite independent of each other--the wine industry, raisin industry\r\nand table-grape industry. Each of these industries depends on grapes\r\nmore or less specially adapted to the product, the special\r\ncharacteristics being secured chiefly through somewhat distinct types\r\nof grapes but depending partly on soil and climatic conditions. The\r\nmanufacture of unfermented grape-juice is not yet a success in this\r\nregion for the reasons that Vinifera grapes do not make a good\r\nunfermented juice, and American grapes are not grown in sufficient\r\nquantities to warrant the establishment of grape-juice plants.\r\n\r\nBioletti gives the extent of the grape-growing industry in California\r\nas follows:[1]\r\n\r\n\"The vineyards of California covered in 1912 about 385,000 acres. Of\r\nthis total, about 180,000 acres were producing wine-grapes. Roughly,\r\n50 per cent of the wine was produced in the great interior valleys,\r\nincluding most of the sweet wines; 35 per cent was produced by the\r\nvalleys and hillsides of the Coast ranges, including most of the dry\r\nwines; the remaining 15 per cent was produced in Southern California\r\nand included both sweet and dry.\r\n\r\n\"The raisin-grape vineyards covered about 130,000 acres, of which\r\nabout 90 per cent were in the San Joaquin Valley, 7 per cent in the\r\nSacramento, and 3 per cent in Southern California.\r\n\r\n\"The shipping-grape vineyards are reckoned at 75,000 acres,\r\ndistributed about as follows: 50 per cent in the Sacramento Valley, 40\r\nper cent in San Joaquin, 6 per cent in Southern California, and 4 per\r\ncent in the Coast ranges.\"\r\n\r\n_The Chautauqua grape-belt._\r\n\r\nThe Chautauqua grape-belt, lying along the northeastern shore of Lake\r\nErie in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio, is the second most important\r\ngrape region in America. The \"belt\" is a narrow strip of lowland\r\naveraging about three miles in width, lying between Lake Erie and a\r\nhigh escarpment which bounds the belt on the south throughout its\r\nentire length of a hundred or more miles. Here climate and soil seem\r\nto be exceptionally favorable for grape-growing. Climate is the chief\r\ndeterminant of the boundaries of this belt, since there are several\r\ntypes of soil upon which grapes do equally well in the region, and\r\nwhen the climate changes at the two extremities of the belt where the\r\nescarpment becomes low, or when the distance between the lake and the\r\nescarpment is great, grape-growing ceases to be profitable.\r\n\r\nThe growers of this region are organized into selling associations so\r\nthat estimates of acreage and yields are obtainable. At present\r\nwriting, 1918, there are in this belt in New York about 35,000 acres\r\nof grapes; in Pennsylvania and Ohio, about 15,000 acres, much the\r\ngreater part of which is in Pennsylvania. The average yield of grapes\r\nto the acre for the region is about two tons. The average total\r\nproduction for the past five years has been about 100,000 tons, of\r\nwhich 65,000 tons are shipped as table-grapes, and 35,000 tons are\r\nused in the manufacture of wine and grape-juice. Among varieties,\r\nConcord reigns supreme in the Chautauqua belt. The writer, in 1906,\r\nmade a canvass of the region, vineyard by vineyard, and found that 90\r\nper cent of the acreage of the belt was set to Concord, 3 per cent to\r\nNiagara, 2 per cent to Worden and the remaining 5 per cent to a dozen\r\nor more varieties of which Moore Early and Delaware led.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of grape-juice on a commercial scale began in the\r\nChautauqua belt and most of this product is still produced in the\r\nregion. Here, only Concord grapes of the best quality are used for\r\ngrape-juice. The growth of this industry is most significant for the\r\nfuture of grape-growing in the region. Twenty years ago grape-juice\r\nwas a negligible factor in the grape industry of this region; at\r\npresent, the annual output is in the neighborhood of 4,000,000\r\ngallons. Grape-juice-makers now determine the price of grapes for the\r\nregion, and while the quantity used is less than that for\r\ntable-grapes, the time is not distant when it will be greater.\r\n\r\n_The Niagara region._\r\n\r\nFifty miles due north of the Chautauqua belt, across the end of Lake\r\nErie and the narrow isthmus of Niagara, is a smaller belt on the\r\nsouthern shore of Lake Ontario so similar in soil, climate and\r\ntopography that in these respects the two regions might be considered\r\nas identical. This is the Niagara region, Canada's chief\r\ngrape-producing area. It is bounded on the north by Lake Ontario; on\r\nthe south, at a distance of one to three miles by the high Niagara\r\nescarpment; to the east it crosses the Niagara River into New York;\r\nand in the west tapers to a point at Hamilton on the westward\r\nextremity of Lake Ontario. Here, again, is the influence of climate\r\ndistinctly manifested. As this belt passes into New York, it widens\r\nand the influence of Lake Ontario is less and less felt to the\r\neastward, and in consequence grape-growing becomes less and less\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\nThere were, according to the Ontario Bureau of Industries, in 1914,\r\nabout 10,850 acres of grapes in the Niagara region in Canada, and\r\npossibly 4,000 acres more near the Niagara River and along the shore\r\nof Lake Ontario in New York. The Niagara grape originated on the\r\nAmerican side of the Niagara region and is here planted more\r\nextensively than elsewhere. Grape-growing in this region is similar in\r\nall respects to that of the Chautauqua belt, the same varieties and\r\nnearly identical methods of pruning, cultivation, spraying and\r\nharvesting being employed. The crop is chiefly used as table-grapes\r\nbut the grape-juice industry is growing.\r\n\r\n_The Central Lakes region of New York._\r\n\r\nIn the central part of western New York are several remarkable bodies\r\nof water known as the Central Lakes. Three of these are large and deep\r\nenough to give ideal climatic conditions for grapes, and about these\r\nlakes are grouped several important areas of vineyards, making this\r\nthe third most important grape region in America. The region assumes\r\nfurther importance because most of the champagne made in America is\r\nproduced here, and it is the chief center of still wines in eastern\r\nAmerica as well. It is further distinguished by its distinctive types\r\nof grapes, Catawba and Delaware taking the place of Concord and\r\nNiagara, the sorts that usually predominate in eastern grape regions.\r\n\r\nThe main body of this region lies on the steep slopes of the high\r\nlands surrounding Keuka Lake. On the shores of this lake there are,\r\napproximately, 15,000 acres of grapes. Adjacent to this main body are\r\nseveral smaller bodies about the neighboring lakes. Thus, at the head\r\nof Canandaigua Lake and on its shores are about 2500 acres; near\r\nSeneca and between Seneca and Cayuga Lakes there are probably 1500\r\nacres more. In a few specially favored places on other of these\r\nCentral Lakes, there are possibly 1000 acres, making all told for this\r\nregion, about 20,000 acres. Again it is climate that sets the seal of\r\napproval on the region for viticulture. In addition to the benefits of\r\ndeep bodies of water, high and sloping lands cause the frosts to cease\r\nearly in the spring and hold them in abeyance in the autumn, giving an\r\nexceptionally long season.\r\n\r\nChampagne-making began here about 1860; at present there are a score\r\nor more manufacturers of champagne, wine and brandy, the output being\r\nannually about 3,000,000 gallons of wine and 2,000,000 bottles of\r\nchampagne. Recently the manufacture of grape-juice has begun and the\r\nindustry is now flourishing.\r\n\r\n_Minor grape regions._\r\n\r\nViticulture is commercially important in several other regions than\r\nthose outlined. Thus, in the valley of the Hudson River, grapes have\r\nbeen grown commercially for nearly a hundred years, the industry\r\nreaching its height between 1880 and 1890, when there were 13,000\r\nacres under cultivation. For some years, however, grape-growing along\r\nthe Hudson has been on the decline. Another region in which\r\nviticulture reaches considerable magnitude is in several islands in\r\nLake Erie near Sandusky, Ohio, the product going largely for the\r\nmanufacture of wine. At one time grapes were grown commercially on the\r\nbanks of the Ohio River about Cincinnati and westward into Indiana.\r\nThe industry here, however, is a thing of the past. Another region in\r\nwhich grape-growing was once of prime importance but now lags has its\r\ncenter at Hermann, Missouri. The newest grape-producing area worthy of\r\nnote is in southwestern Michigan about the towns of Lawton and Paw\r\nPaw. A small but very prosperous grape-growing region has its center\r\nat Egg Harbor, New Jersey. Ives is the mainstay among varieties in\r\nthis region. In the southern states, Muscadine grapes are grown in a\r\nsmall way in every part of the cotton-belt and varieties of other\r\nnative species are to be found in home vineyards in the upland\r\nregions, but nowhere in the South can it be said that grape-growing is\r\na commercial industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DETERMINANTS OF GRAPE REGIONS\r\n\r\nClimate, soil, site, the surface features of the land, insects, fungi\r\nand commercial geography are the chief factors that determine regions\r\nfor money-making in grape-growing. This has been made plain in the\r\nforegoing discussion of grape regions, but the several factors must be\r\ntaken up in greater detail. To bound the regions is of less importance\r\nthan to understand why they exist--less needful to remember, more\r\nneedful to understand. From what has been said, the reader has no\r\ndoubt already concluded that successful grape-growing is in largest\r\nmeasure due to kindliness in climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Climate_\r\n\r\nUnder the assumption, then, that climate, of all factors, is chief in\r\nplaying providence to the grape, let us examine somewhat critically\r\nthe relations of climate to grape-growing. When analyzed, the\r\nessentials of climate, as it governs grape-growing, are found to be\r\nsix: first, length of season; second, seasonal sum of heat; third,\r\namount of humidity in summer weather; fourth, dates of spring and\r\nautumn frosts; fifth, winter temperature; sixth, air currents.\r\n\r\n_Length of season._\r\n\r\nTo reach true perfection, each grape variety has a length of season of\r\nits own. With each, if it is grown in too low a latitude, the vine is\r\nuninterrupted in growth; its leaves tend to become evergreen; and not\r\ninfrequently it produces at the same time blossoms, green fruits and\r\nripe fruits. This is, of course, the extreme to which grapes pass in\r\nthe far South. Again, many northern varieties fail where southern\r\ngrapes succeed because the fruits pass too rapidly from maturity to\r\ndecay. On the other hand, very often southern grapes are hardy in vine\r\nin the North, but the season is not sufficiently long for the fruit to\r\nmature and to acquire sufficient sugar to give them good keeping\r\nquality, properly to pass through vinous fermentation, or even to make\r\na good unfermented grape-juice. In the uneven topography of this\r\ncontinent, it is not possible to state the range in latitude in which\r\ngrapes can be cultivated to advantage, for latitude is often set aside\r\nby altitude. Thus, isothermal lines, or lines of equal temperature,\r\nare much curved in America and do not at all coincide with the\r\nparallels of latitude.\r\n\r\nOther factors, of course, than length of season enter into the\r\nripening of grapes. The daily range in temperature, not always\r\ndependent on latitude, affects ripening. Cool nights may offset warm\r\ndays and delay ripening. Certainly rains, fogs and humid air delay\r\nmaturity. The bottom heat of loose, warm, dry gravelly or stony soils\r\nhastens maturity. Sunshine secured by a sunny aspect or shelter\r\nhastens maturity.\r\n\r\n_The seasonal sum of heat._\r\n\r\nSuccessful cultivation of the grape depends on a sufficient amount of\r\nheat during the summer season. The theory is that buds of the grape\r\ncommence to start when the mean daily temperature reaches a certain\r\nheight, and that the sum of the mean daily temperature must reach a\r\ncertain amount before grapes ripen. Manifestly, this sum must vary\r\nmuch with different varieties, low for the earliest sorts, high for\r\nthe latest. There have been many observations as to the temperatures\r\nat which buds of the grape start growth, so that it is now known that\r\nthe temperature varies in accordance with locality and degree of\r\nmaturity. Roughly speaking, grape buds start at temperatures from 50°\r\nto 60° F. The seasonal sum of heat for ripening is probably 1600 to\r\n2400 units. A variety ought not to be planted, therefore, in a region\r\nin which the average seasonal sum of heat is not sufficiently high.\r\nThe seasonal sum of heat can be determined for a locality from data\r\npublished by the United States Weather Bureau; and by comparing with\r\nthe sum of heat units in localities where a variety is known to\r\nthrive, the grape-grower can determine whether there is sufficient\r\nheat for any particular variety.\r\n\r\nThe grape seldom suffers from hot weather in a grape region. The fruit\r\nis sometimes scalded in the full blaze of a hot sun, but the ample\r\nfoliage of the vine usually furnishes protection against a burning\r\nsun. At maturing time, the heat of an unclouded sun, if the air\r\ncirculates freely, insures a finely finished product. Deep planting\r\nhelps to offset the harmful influences of warm climates.\r\n\r\n_Humidity of summer weather._\r\n\r\nThe grape is very sensitive to moisture conditions, and grows best in\r\nregions where the summer rainfall is comparatively light. A damp and\r\ncloudy summer brings disaster to the vineyard in several ways; as\r\nsmall growth of vine, small set of fruit, a crop of poor quality, and\r\nthe development of the several fungous diseases. Although the grape\r\nstands drought, a superfluity of moisture in the soil may do little\r\nharm, as is shown in irrigated vineyards, but a humid air is fatal to\r\nsuccess especially if the air is both warm and wet. Moist weather\r\nduring the time of maturity is particularly disastrous to the grape,\r\nas are frequent fogs. Cold wet weather in blooming time is the\r\ngrape-grower's vernal bane, since it most effectually prevents the\r\nsetting of fruit. It may be laid down as a rule that the grape lives\r\nby sunlight, warmth and air--it often thrives on the desert's edge.\r\nThese considerations make it manifest that the monthly and seasonal\r\nmeans of precipitation must be considered in selecting a locality to\r\ngrow grapes.\r\n\r\n_Spring and autumn frosts._\r\n\r\nThe average date at which the last killing frost occurs in the spring\r\noften determines the limit in latitude at which the grape can be\r\ngrown. Even in the most favored grape region of the continent, killing\r\nfrosts occasionally destroy the grape crop, and there are few seasons\r\nin which frost does not take some toll. Thus on May 7, 1916, frost all\r\nbut ruined the crop of wine- and table-grapes in the great grape\r\nregion of northern California where frosts are seldom expected in May.\r\nLittle or nothing can be done to protect grapes from frost. Windbreaks\r\nas often favor the frost as the vine, and smudging or heating the\r\nvineyards is too expensive to be practical. In growing grapes,\r\ntherefore, the commonly recognized precaution of selecting a site\r\nnear water, on slopes or in a warm thermal belt must be exercised.\r\n\r\nThe limits of grape culture are also determined by early autumn\r\nfrosts. The grape stands two or three degrees of frost, but anything\r\nlower usually destroys the crop. Here, again, the only precaution is\r\nto take pains in selecting the site.\r\n\r\n_The use of weather data and dates of life events of the grape._\r\n\r\nThese considerations of length of season, humidity and spring and fall\r\nfrosts make it plain that the grape-grower must synchronize these\r\nphases of climate with the life events of the grape. In particular, he\r\nmust study weather data in relation to the blooming and ripening of\r\ngrapes. Usually, the necessary weather data may be secured from the\r\nnearest local weather bureau, while the date of blooming and ripening\r\nmay be obtained from the state experiment stations in the states where\r\nthe grape is an important crop.\r\n\r\n_Winter temperature._\r\n\r\nVarieties of native grapes are seldom injured in America by\r\nwinter-killing, since they are usually planted in climates in which\r\nwild grapes withstand winter conditions. Native varieties follow the\r\nrule that plant and climate are truly congenial in regions in which\r\nthe plant thrives without the aid of man. A few varieties of native\r\ngrapes fare badly in the winter's cold of northern grape regions, and\r\nthe tender Vinifera vine is at the mercy of the winter wherever the\r\nmercury goes below zero. In cold climates, therefore, care must be\r\nexercised in selecting hardy varieties and in following careful\r\ncultural methods with the tender sorts. If other climatic conditions\r\nare favorable, however, winter-killing is not an unsurmountable\r\ndifficulty, since the grape is easily protected from cold, so easily\r\nthat the tender Viniferas may be grown in the cold North with winter\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n_Air currents._\r\n\r\nCurrents of air are of but local importance in growing tree-fruits,\r\nbut are of general and vital importance in growing the grape. The\r\ndirection, force and frequency of prevailing winds are often\r\ncontrolling factors in the suppression of fungous diseases of the\r\ngrape, and the presence of fungi often means success or failure in\r\nregions in which the grape is planted. Winds are beneficial, too, when\r\nthey bring warm air or dry air, and when they keep frosty air in\r\nmotion. The air must move in all grape regions, whether from cañon,\r\nmountain, lake or sea. Sunlight, warmth, and air in motion are life to\r\nthe grape. Sometimes winds may be detrimental; as when too cold, too\r\nblustering, or when they bring hail, the latter being about the most\r\ndisastrous of all natural calamities. Windbreaks are of small value\r\nand are often worse than useless. Having planted his vineyard, the\r\ngrape-grower must take the winds as they blow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils for grapes_\r\n\r\nA prime requisite for a vineyard being earth in which vines will grow,\r\nsuccessful grape-growing is eminently dependent on the selection of\r\nsoil. Many mistakes are made in the great grape regions in planting on\r\nunsuitable soils, the planter going on the assumption that any soil in\r\na grape region should be good enough for the grape. But the crust of\r\nthe earth in grape regions is not all grape soil. In New York, for\r\nexample, much of the land in the three grape regions is better fitted\r\nfor producing crops for the mason or road-mender than for the\r\ngrape-grower. Other soils in these regions are fit for vineyards only\r\nwhen tiled, and tiling does not make all wet land fit for tilling.\r\nHeavy, clammy clays, light sands, soils parched with thirst, thin or\r\nhungry soils--on all of these the grower may plant but will seldom\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\n_The ideal soil._\r\n\r\nGrapes may be well grown in a wide range of soils if the land is well\r\ndrained, open to air and if it holds heat. But without these\r\nessentials, whatever the soil, all subsequent treatment fails to\r\nproduce a good vineyard. Generally speaking, the grape grows best in a\r\nlight, free-working, gravelly loam, but there are many good vineyards\r\nin gravelly or stony clays, gravel or stone to furnish drainage, let\r\nin the air and to hold heat. Contrary to general belief, the grape\r\nseldom thrives in very sandy soils unless there is a fair admixture of\r\nclay, considerable decomposing vegetable matter and a clay subsoil.\r\nThe latter, however, must not come too close to the surface. Some of\r\nthe best vineyard lands in the country are very stony, the stones\r\nhindering only in making the land difficult to till. Nearly all grapes\r\nrequire a friable soil, compactness being a serious defect. Virgil,\r\nwriting in Christ's time, gave good advice as to soil for the vine:\r\n\r\n    \"A free loose earth is what the vines demand,\r\n    Where wind and frost have help'd the lab'rer's hand,\r\n    And sturdy peasants deep have stirr'd the land.\"\r\n\r\nCold, churlish, sticky or clammy clays are never to the liking of the\r\ngrape.\r\n\r\nGreat fertility is not necessary in grape lands. Indeed, the grape is\r\nconspicuous among cultivated plants for ability to nourish itself\r\nwhere the food supply is scant. Soils naturally too rich produce an\r\novergrowth of vine, the season's wood does not mature, the crop does\r\nnot set, and the grapes lack sugar, size, color and flavor. Good\r\nphysical condition and warmth in a well-watered, well-aired soil\r\nenable the grape to search far and wide for its food.\r\n\r\n_Drainage._\r\n\r\nNo cultivated grape endures a wet soil; all demand drainage. A few\r\nsorts may thrive for a time in moist, heavy land, but more often they\r\ndo not live though they may linger. The water-table should be at least\r\ntwo feet from the surface. If by chance this comes naturally, so much\r\nthe better, but otherwise the land must be tile-drained. Sloping land\r\nis by no means always well drained, many hillsides having a subsoil so\r\nimpervious or so retentive of moisture that under-drainage is a\r\nnecessity. The texture of the land is usually improved so greatly by\r\ngood drainage that the grower has little need to rely on the clemency\r\nof the season in carrying on vineyard cultivation in well-drained\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_Soil adaptations._\r\n\r\nIn the refinement of viticulture, grape-growers find that particular\r\nvarieties grow best in a particular soil, the likes and dislikes being\r\ndetermined only by trial, for the peculiarities which adapt a soil to\r\na variety are not analyzable. Some varieties, on the other hand, the\r\nConcord being a good example, grow fruitfully in a great variety of\r\nsoils. Each of the several species with their varieties has quite\r\ndistinct adaptations to soils. This is taken advantage of in planting\r\nvarieties on uncongenial soils after they have been grafted on a vine\r\nwhich finds itself at home in the particular soil. Much has been\r\naccomplished in growing varieties on uncongenial soils by consorting\r\nthem with other stocks, an operation which has brought forth volumes\r\nof discussion as to the adaptabilities of cions to stocks and stocks\r\nto soils, subjects to receive attention on a later page.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insects and fungi_\r\n\r\nThe profitable grape regions of the country have all been established\r\nin regions comparatively free from grape insects and fungi. If pests\r\ncame later in considerable numbers, the industry, in the old days,\r\nperished. Here and there in the agricultural regions of the country\r\nmay be found a sorry company of halt and maimed vines, remnants of\r\nonce flourishing vineyards, brought to their miserable condition by\r\nsome scourge of insects or fungi. The advent of spraying and of better\r\nknowledge of the habits of the pests has greatly lessened the\r\nimportance of parasites as a factor in determining the value of a\r\nregion for grape-growing; but even in the light of the new knowledge,\r\nit is not wise to go against Nature in regions where pests are\r\nstrongly intrenched.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Commercial factors_\r\n\r\nThe dominant factors that lead to the planting of large areas to any\r\none fruit are often economic ones; as transportation, markets, labor,\r\nfacilities for making by-products, and opportunity to join in buying\r\nand selling organizations. All of these factors play an important part\r\nin determining the bounds of grape regions, but a lesser part than in\r\nthe establishment of large areas of other fruits, for the reason that\r\nthe grape is so largely grown for raisins, wine, champagne and\r\ngrape-juice, products condensed in form, made with little labor,\r\neasily transported, which keep long and find ready market at any time.\r\nAgain, where natural conditions are favorable for grape-growing, the\r\ncrop comes almost as a gift from Nature; whereas, if the grower must\r\nbreast the blows of unfavorable natural circumstances, no matter how\r\nfavorable the economic factors may be, the vineyard is seldom\r\nprofitable. Natural factors, therefore, outweigh economic ones in\r\ngrape-growing, but the latter must be considered in seeking a site for\r\na vineyard, a task discussed under several heads to follow.\r\n\r\n_Accessibility to markets._\r\n\r\nMarkets ought to be accessible in commercial grape-growing. A location\r\nin which there is a good local market, and at the same time ample\r\nfacilities for shipping to distant markets, is desirable. If there\r\nare also opportunities to dispose of any surplus to makers of raisins,\r\nwine or grape-juice, the grower has well-nigh attained the ideal.\r\nFurther to be desired are good roads, short hauls, quick\r\ntransportation, reasonable freight rates, refrigerator service and\r\ncoöperative agencies. The more of these advantages a grower has at his\r\ndisposal, the less likely he is to fail in commercial competition.\r\n\r\n_General_ versus _local markets._\r\n\r\nThe grower must be reminded rather than informed that he must decide\r\nin locating his vineyard whether he will grow for distant markets, for\r\nmanufacturing into grape products, or for local markets. Determination\r\nto grow grapes once made, subsequent procedure at every step depends\r\non the disposition to be made of the product. Summarized, the\r\ndifferences in growing grapes for the two markets are: For the general\r\nmarket: the acreage should be large; the market may be distant; the\r\nvarieties few; the cost of production low; sales large and prices low;\r\nthe dealings are with middlemen; and extensive culture is practiced.\r\nFor the local market: the acreage may be small; the market must be\r\nnear and prices must be high; the sales are direct to the consumer;\r\nthere must be succession in ripening; and intensive culture is\r\npracticed. For the general market, the vineyard is the unit; for the\r\nlocal market, the variety should be the unit. In this discussion,\r\nhowever, \"large acreage\" and \"extensive culture\" set against \"small\r\nacreage\" and \"intensive culture\" may mislead. This is a case in which\r\na large endeavor may be a small endeavor, and a small endeavor a large\r\none; or, in which it may be well to take the advice of Virgil, who\r\nadvised Roman vineyardists, \"Praise great estates; farm a small one.\"\r\n\r\nThe grape-growing of the times tends more and more to growing for\r\ngeneral markets. The grower plants to skim a comparatively small\r\nreturn from a large area. This division of grape-growing is now well\r\ndeveloped in America. Intensive grape-growing for local markets is not\r\nwell developed. There are, however, many opportunities in America for\r\neasy triumphs in fruit-growing in the planting of vineyards for local\r\nmarkets. No other fruit responds to fine art in culture so well as the\r\ngrape. Given choicely good varieties and a finely finished product,\r\nand the grower may have almost what he desires for the produce of his\r\nskill. With the grape, too, palm of merit goes with skill in culture;\r\namong all who grow plants, only the florist can rival the\r\nviticulturist in guiding the development of a plant to a special end.\r\nIn cultivating, fertilizing, training, grafting, pruning, spraying, in\r\nevery cultural operation, the grape-grower has opportunities to sell\r\nhis skill not given in so high degree to the grower of other fruits.\r\n\r\n_Labor._\r\n\r\nA great advantage in the congregation of vineyardists in grape regions\r\nis found when labor must be obtained. Skilled labor is required to\r\ncultivate the vine, and such labor can be freely secured only in\r\ncenters of viticulture. Grape-growing is a specialists' business, and\r\nit takes more than a day or a season to make a vine-dresser out of a\r\nfarmer, gardener or an orchardist. Expert labor is most easily\r\nobtained and is of best quality where grapes abound. Common labor must\r\nbe somewhat abundant, also, in good vineyard locations, for such rush\r\ntasks as tying and picking. In these two operations, women, children\r\nor other unskilled labor may be employed to advantage. The grape\r\nharvest must often be hurried, and to keep it in full swing a near-by\r\ncity from which to draw pickers is a great asset.\r\n\r\n_Vineyard sites._\r\n\r\nWithin a grape region, the site is important in determining where to\r\nplant. The site is the local position of the vineyard. Sites cannot\r\nbe standardized, and therefore no two are alike. The cardinal natural\r\nfactors to be secured in a site are warmth, sun, air and freedom from\r\nfrost. These factors have been discussed in a general way under the\r\nclimate of grape regions, but one needs to particularize a little more\r\nclosely to ascertain how they affect individual vineyards. Warmth,\r\nsun, air and frostlessness are best secured by proximity to water,\r\nhigh land and proper exposure.\r\n\r\n_Proximity to water._\r\n\r\nThe favorable influences of water are well illustrated in the grape\r\nregions of New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Canada. All of the grape\r\ndistricts in these regions are bounded on one or more sides by water.\r\nThe equalizing effects of large bodies of water on temperature, warmer\r\nwinter and cooler summer, are so well known as scarcely to need\r\ncomment. Hardly less important than the effects of water on\r\ntemperature are the off-shore breezes of night and the in-shore\r\nbreezes of day which blow on large bodies of water. These keep the air\r\nof the vineyard in constant motion and so prevent frosts in spring and\r\nautumn, and also dry foliage and fruit so that spores of fungi have\r\ndifficulty in finding foothold. But if water brings fogs, dews and\r\nhumidity, as does the Pacific, grapes must be planted inland;\r\notherwise leaf, bloom and fruit are born in the blight of fungi. The\r\nbenign influences of water are felt in the eastern grape regions at\r\ndistances of one to four miles, seldom farther. These narrow belts\r\nabout the eastern waters are bounded on the landward side by high\r\nbluffs over which many showers fail to pass and which protect the\r\nbelts below from heavy dews. Where the background of bluffs in these\r\nregions sinks to level land, vineyards cease.\r\n\r\nVineyards are usually some distance above the water, the range in\r\naltitude running from fifty to five hundred feet. Where the altitude\r\nis much higher, immunity to frosts and winter freezing ceases, for\r\nthe reason that the atmosphere is rarer and drier so that heat\r\nradiates rapidly from the land. As the height increases, also, the\r\nrevels of the wind play havoc with the vines. Yet, one is often\r\nsurprised to find good vineyards at the level of the lakes or, on the\r\nother hand, crowning high hills. Altitude in grape-growing must,\r\ntherefore, be determined by experiment. We know very little of the\r\nformation of the thermal belts on high land so favorable to the grape.\r\n\r\n_The lay of the land._\r\n\r\nWe associate the grape with rugged land; as the vines on the banks of\r\nthe Rhine, the rolling lands of Burgundy, the slopes of Vesuvius and\r\nOlympus, the high hills of Madeira, the cloud-capped mountains of\r\nTeneriffe, mountain slopes in California and the escarpments of grape\r\nregions in eastern America. These examples prove how well adapted\r\nrolling lands, inclined plains and even steep and rocky hillsides are\r\nto the culture of the vine. Virgil long ago wrote, \"Bacchus is partial\r\nto broad, sunny hills.\" Yet rolling lands are not essential to the\r\nculture of the grape, for in Europe and America very good grapes are\r\ngrown on unsheltered plains, provided the land has an elevation on one\r\nor more boundaries above the surrounding country. If the conditions of\r\nsoil and climate which the grape requires can be found on level land\r\nor moderate slopes, such situations are much better than steep\r\ndeclivities, since on these the cost of all vineyard operations is\r\ngreater and heavy rains erode the soil. The soil on hills, too, is\r\noften scant and niggardly. Level land, however, must not be shut in on\r\nall sides by higher land as untimely frost will often lay waste vines\r\nin such a situation.\r\n\r\n_Exposures._\r\n\r\nThe exposure, or the slope of the land toward a point of the compass,\r\nis important in choosing a site for the vineyard, although the value\r\nof particular exposures is often exaggerated. Let it be remembered\r\nthat good grapes may be grown in vineyards exposed to any point of the\r\ncompass, but that slight advantages may sometimes come, depending on\r\nthe particular environment of the plantation, and then solve the\r\nproblem according to conditions. The following are theories as to\r\nexposure: A southern exposure is warmer and hence earlier than a\r\nnorthern, and is, therefore, the best slope for early grapes as well\r\nas for very late ones liable to be caught by frost. Northward and\r\nwestward slopes retard the leafing and blooming period, thus often\r\nenabling the grape to escape untimely spring frosts; though to plant\r\non such slopes may be robbing Peter to pay Paul, as what is gained in\r\nretardation in spring may be lost in the fall with the result that the\r\nvines may be caught by frost and may fail to ripen their crop. Frost\r\ndamage is usually greatest on a bold eastern slope, and vines suffer\r\nmost in winter freezes on this exposure, since the direct rays of the\r\nrising sun strike the frozen plants so that they are more injured than\r\notherwise by rapid thawing. In locations near bodies of water, the\r\nbest slope is toward the water, regardless of direction. The exposure\r\nmay sometimes be selected to advantage with reference to the\r\nprevailing winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.--Fitting the land for planting.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPROPAGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grape commends itself to commercial and amateur growers alike by\r\nits ease of propagation. The vines of all species may be propagated\r\nfrom seed, and all but one of the several cultivated species may be\r\ngrown readily from cuttings or layers. All yield to grafting of one\r\nkind or another. Seeds are planted only to produce new varieties. At\r\none time stocks were grown from seed, but this practice has fallen\r\ninto disrepute because of the great variations in the seedlings.\r\nVarieties on their own roots and stocks are for most part propagated\r\nfrom cuttings. In the production of stocks, the viticulturist sets the\r\norchardist a good example, for there can be no question that all\r\ntree-fruits suffer from being grown on seedling stocks. The grape is a\r\nvigorous, self-assertive plant and once it is started, whether from\r\nseeds, cuttings or layers, seldom fails to grow.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLINGS\r\n\r\nGrowing seedling grapes is the simplest of operations. The seeds are\r\ntaken from the grapes at harvest time, after which they must pass\r\nthrough a resting period of a few months. At once or in a month or\r\ntwo, the seeds should be stratified in moist sand and stored in a cold\r\nplace until spring, when they may be sown in flats or in the open\r\nground; or seed may be sown in a well-prepared piece of garden land in\r\nthe autumn. When planted in the open, autumn or spring, the seeds are\r\nput in at the depth of an inch, an inch or two apart and in rows\r\nconvenient for cultivation. Subsequent care consists of cultivation\r\nif the seed are sown in garden rows, and in pricking out when true\r\nleaves appear if planted in flats. In ground that crusts, an expedient\r\nis to mix grape seed with apple seed; the apple seedlings, being more\r\nvigorous, break the crust and act as nurse plants to the more tender\r\ngrapes. Sometimes it is helpful to the young plants to mulch the\r\nground lightly with lawn clippings or moss. Grape seedlings grow\r\nrapidly, often making from two to three feet of wood in a season.\r\n\r\nThe young plants are thinned or set to stand four or five inches apart\r\nin the nursery row. At the end of the first season, all plants are cut\r\nback severely and almost entirely covered with earth by plowing up to\r\nthe row on both sides. This earth, of course, is leveled the following\r\nspring. If the seasons are propitious and all goes well, the seedlings\r\nare ready for the vineyard at the end of the second season, but if for\r\nany reason they have fared badly during their first two years, it is\r\nmuch better to give them a third season in the nursery. Seedling vines\r\nare seldom as vigorous as those from cuttings, and unusual care must\r\nbe taken in setting in the vineyard, though the operation is\r\nessentially the same as that to be described for vines from cuttings.\r\nThe third season the vines are kept to a single shoot and are pinched\r\nback when the canes reach a length of five or six feet. In the autumn,\r\nthey are pruned back to two or three feet. In the spring of the fourth\r\nseason, the trellis is put up and a few fruits may be allowed to\r\nripen.\r\n\r\nThe vines of promise may now be selected. The plants, however, must\r\nfruit twice or oftener before it can be told whether hopes are\r\nconsummated or must be deferred. Growing seedlings for new varieties\r\nis a game full of chances in which, while there may be little\r\nimmediate or individual gain, there is much pleasure. It is hardly too\r\nmuch to say that the grape industry of eastern America, with its\r\n300,000 acres and 1500 varieties, betokens the good that has come from\r\ngrowing seedling grapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDORMANT CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nVines for vineyards, with the exception of varieties of Rotundifolia,\r\nare propagated from cuttings of hard wood taken from the season's\r\ncanes when the vines are pruned. The inactive buds in these cuttings\r\nmay be brought into active growth, and roots induced to grow from the\r\ncut surfaces by various means. By this miracle of Nature, an infinite\r\nnumber of plants, in an endless procession, may be propagated from the\r\nproduct of a single seed, each plant complete in its heredity and\r\ndiffering from its fellows only in accordance with environment.\r\n\r\n_Time to make cuttings._\r\n\r\nA good cutting should have a protective callus over the cut and this\r\nrequires time, so that the sooner cuttings are made after the wood\r\nbecomes thoroughly dormant the better. Besides, the cutting should use\r\nits stored food material for the formation of adventitious roots\r\nrather than have it pass into buds, as it quickly does late in the\r\ndormant season when buds are about to open. If cuttings must be made\r\nlate in the season, transplanting must be delayed as long as possible,\r\nand the cuttings be set in a northerly aspect to prevent the premature\r\ndevelopment of the buds. However, the grape responds surprisingly well\r\nto the call of Nature in forming roots, and great importance need not\r\nbe attached to the time at which the cuttings are made.\r\n\r\n_Selecting cutting wood._\r\n\r\nCuttings are made from one-year-old wood; that is, canes produced\r\nduring the summer are taken for cuttings in the fall. Immature canes\r\nand those with soft, spongy wood ought not to be used. Strong vigorous\r\ncanes should be given preference over weak growth, but most nurserymen\r\nmaintain that very large canes do not make as good cuttings as do\r\nthose of medium size, the objection to large size being that the\r\ncuttings do not root as well. Short-jointed wood is better than\r\nlong-jointed. Cuttings from vines weakened by insects and fungi are\r\nliable to be weak, soft, immature and poorly stored with food. The\r\nwood should be smooth and straight.\r\n\r\n_Making the cutting._\r\n\r\nGrape cuttings vary in length from four inches to two feet, the length\r\ndepending on the climate and the soil of the nursery and the species\r\nand variety. The hotter and drier the climate and the lighter the\r\nsoil, the longer the cutting needs to be. Six to nine inches, however,\r\nis the usual length in the climate of eastern America, while on the\r\nPacific slope the length varies from eight to fifteen inches. For\r\nconvenience in handling, all cuttings should be approximately of the\r\nsame length, to insure which some kind of simple gauge is needed.\r\nVarious gauges are used, as marks cut in the working table, a stick of\r\nthe required length, or a cutting-box.\r\n\r\nIn making the cuttings, a slanting cut is made close below the lowest\r\nbud, while about an inch of wood is left above the upper bud. When\r\npossible, a heel of old wood is left at the lower end; or, still\r\nbetter, a whorl of buds, as roots usually start from each bud. The\r\nfinished cuttings are tied in bundles, all butts one way, and are then\r\nready to be heeled-in. This is done by burying in trenches, butts up,\r\nand covering with a few inches of soil. It is important to invert the\r\ncuttings in trenching, since otherwise the tops often start to grow\r\nbefore the butts are properly calloused, and it is very essential that\r\nthe tops remain dormant until roots appear to support the new growth.\r\n\r\n_Planting the cuttings._\r\n\r\nCuttings are planted in the nursery in rows wide enough apart for\r\ncultivation and two or three inches apart in the row. Trenches are\r\nmade with a plow; perpendicular if the cuttings are shorter, and a\r\nlittle slanting if longer than six inches. The cuttings are set at a\r\ndepth which permits the upper buds to project above the ground, as\r\nshown in Fig. 6. When the cuttings in a row are placed, two inches of\r\nsoil are put in and pressed firmly about the base of the cuttings.\r\nThen the trench is evenly filled with earth and the cultivator\r\nfollows. Doing duty by the young plants consists in cultivating often\r\nduring the summer to keep the soil moist and mellow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. Planting cuttings.]\r\n\r\nThe cuttings are planted as soon as the ground is warm and dry enough\r\nto work. To delay planting too long invites injury from drought, which\r\nalmost annually parches the land in eastern America. Irrigation gives\r\nmore leeway to planting time in the West. When warm sunny weather,\r\naccompanied by an occasional shower, predominates, the cuttings start\r\ngrowth almost at once, as shown in Fig. 7, and by fall, all things\r\nbeing propitious, make a growth from four to six feet. With the\r\ncuttings three inches and the rows three feet apart, 58,080 vines may\r\nbe grown to the acre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. A cutting beginning growth.]\r\n\r\n_Single-eye cuttings._\r\n\r\nNew and rare varieties are propagated from single-eye cuttings,\r\nthereby doubling the number of plants from the propagating wood. This\r\nmethod gives an opportunity, also, to start the work of propagating\r\nearly in the season, since single-eye cuttings are nearly always\r\nrooted by artificial heat. But the greatest value of the method is\r\nthat some varieties which cannot be propagated in any other way\r\nreadily grow under artificial heat from single-eyes. Well-grown vines\r\nso propagated are as good as those grown by any other method, but the\r\ngreat disadvantage is that unless much care and skill are used, vines\r\nfrom these cuttings are poor and quite worthless. It is also a more\r\nexpensive method than growing from long cuttings out of doors.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of making single-eye cuttings. The most common\r\nform of the cutting is the single bud with an inch of wood above and\r\nbelow, the ends being cut with a slant. Some modify this form by\r\ncutting away the wood on the side opposite the bud, exposing the pith\r\nthe whole length of the cutting. In another form, a square cut is made\r\ndirectly under the bud, leaving an inch and a half of wood above. Or\r\nthis last form is modified by making a long sloping cut from the bud\r\nto the upper end, thereby exposing the maximum amount of cambium.\r\nAdvantages are claimed for each form, but these are mostly imaginary,\r\nand the cutting may be made to suit the fancy of the propagator if a\r\nfew essentials are observed.\r\n\r\nSingle-eye cuttings are made in the fall and are stored in sand until\r\nlate winter, about February in New York. At this time the cuttings are\r\nplanted horizontally an inch deep in a sand propagating bench in a\r\ncool greenhouse. If the cuttings are not well calloused, they remain\r\none or two weeks in a temperature of 40° to 50° without bottom heat,\r\nbut well-made cuttings are calloused and ready to strike root so that\r\nbrisk bottom heat can be applied at once. After six weeks or two\r\nmonths, the young plants are ready to pot off or to transplant in a\r\ncold-frame or cool greenhouse. If but a few plants are to be grown,\r\nthey may be started in two- or three-inch pots, shifting into larger\r\npots once or twice as growth progresses. In early summer, the young\r\nplants are set in nursery rows out of doors and by fall the young\r\nvines should be strong and vigorous.\r\n\r\nSingle-eyes are also started in hot-beds, cold-frames and even in the\r\nopen air without the aid of artificial heat. In hot-beds and\r\ncold-frames, the method is only a modification of that described for\r\ngreenhouses. Out of doors the cuttings are given the same conditions\r\nunder which long cuttings are rooted, except that the whole of the\r\nshort cutting is buried an inch deep in the nursery row.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBACEOUS CUTTINGS\r\n\r\nGrapes are easily propagated from herbaceous cuttings, although since\r\nthe vines are weak and the method expensive, they are seldom used.\r\nGreen cuttings are usually taken from plants forced in greenhouses,\r\nbut may be taken in summer from vineyard vines. A green cutting is\r\nusually cut with two buds with the leaf at the upper one left on. The\r\ncuttings are set in propagating beds of sand, or pots of sand, in\r\nclose frames under which there is brisk bottom heat. To prevent\r\nexcessive evaporation, the frames are kept closed and the atmosphere\r\nwarm and moist. As growth progresses, or if mildew appears, the frames\r\nare more and more ventilated. In two to four weeks, the cuttings\r\nshould have rooted sufficiently well to be transplanted to pots.\r\nHerbaceous cuttings made in the summer must be kept under glass until\r\nthe following spring.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYERING\r\n\r\nThe grape is readily propagated from layers of either green or mature\r\nwood, the method being certain, convenient and producing extra\r\nvigorous plants. The drawback is that fewer plants can be obtained by\r\nlayering than from cuttings with a given amount of wood. Varieties of\r\nsome species, however, cannot be propagated by cuttings, and with\r\nthese layering becomes of supreme importance to the propagator. Nearly\r\nall varieties of Rotundifolia and some of Æstivalis are best grown\r\nfrom layers. So far as is known, all varieties of cultivated species\r\nmay be grown by layering, and since the method is simple and certain\r\nand the vines vigorous and easily handled, this method is commended to\r\nsmall growers of grapes.\r\n\r\n_Dormant wood layering._\r\n\r\nThe work of layering mature wood usually begins in the spring, but the\r\nvines from which the layers are to be taken should have received\r\npreliminary treatment the preceding season. The vines to be layered\r\nare severely cut back a year or more before the layering is to be done\r\nto induce a vigorous growth of canes. Strong vigorous canes are laid\r\nin a shallow trench, two to five inches deep, in which they are\r\nfastened with wood or wire pegs or staples. The trench is then partly\r\nfilled with fine, moist, mellow earth which is firmly packed about the\r\ncane. Roots strike and shoots spring from each joint. When the young\r\nplants are well above ground, the trench is completely filled, and\r\nthen, or a little later, the young plants are staked to keep them out\r\nof the way of the cultivator. The following fall the young vines are\r\nready to transplant.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of layering have been given, but a number of\r\nnon-essentials may be helpful under some conditions. Thus, dormant\r\nwood may be layered in the fall, in which case the cane is usually\r\nnotched or ringed at the joint to induce the formation of roots. The\r\nless the number of joints covered, the stronger the young vines, so\r\nthat while the number is usually five, six or more extra vigorous\r\nplants may be obtained by covering only one or two joints. In\r\npropagating Rotundifolia grapes, it is expected that lateral branches\r\nwill make the tops of the new plants. These, at the time of layering,\r\nare cut back to eight or ten inches, all on the same side of the\r\nvine, and are not left closer together than twelve inches. In nursery\r\npractice, Rotundifolia vines are trained along the ground for\r\nlayering. Vines on arbors, in greenhouses, or on sides of buildings\r\nare easily layered in boxes or pots of soil. Plants grown from layers\r\nare not as conveniently handled as those from cuttings.\r\n\r\n_Green wood layering._\r\n\r\nLayered plants from green wood are sometimes grown to multiply quickly\r\nnew or rare varieties. The work is accomplished in midsummer by\r\nbending down and covering shoots of the present season's growth.\r\nStrong plants are seldom obtained from summer-layering and it is never\r\nsafe to attempt to grow more than one or two plants from a shoot. The\r\nmost forceful culture possible must be given summer-layered plants\r\nafter the separation from the parent vine. It is very generally agreed\r\nthat plants from summer-layers not only do not give good plants, but\r\nthat the parent vine is injured in taking an offspring from it in this\r\nway.\r\n\r\n_Layering to fill vacancies in the vineyard._\r\n\r\nThere is sure to be an occasional gap even in the best vineyard. Young\r\nplants set in vacancies must compete with neighboring full-grown\r\nvines, and often in a bit of land so unfavorable that it may have been\r\nthe cause of the demise of the original occupant. Under these\r\ncircumstances, the newcomer stands a poor chance for life. A plant\r\nintroduced by layering a strong cane from a near-by vine has little\r\ndifficulty in establishing itself on its own roots, after which it can\r\nbe separated from the parent. Such layering is best done by taking in\r\nearly spring a strong, unpruned cane from an adjoining plant in the\r\nsame row and covering an end joint six inches deep in the vacant\r\nplace, but leaving sufficient wood on the end of the cane to turn up\r\nperpendicularly out of the soil. This free end becomes the new plant\r\nand by the following fall or spring may be separated from its parent.\r\nNot infrequently the young plant bears fruit the second season on its\r\nown roots. This method is of especial value in small plantations,\r\nwhereby the trouble of ordering one or two plants is avoided and the\r\nadvantage of early fruiting is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAFTING\r\n\r\nSince grafting grapes is intimately connected with stocks, the growing\r\nof which is a modern practice, grafting is thought of as a new process\r\nin growing this fruit. Quite to the contrary, it is an old practice.\r\nCato, the sturdy old Roman grape-grower who lived nearly two hundred\r\nyears before Christ, speaks of grafting grapes, although Theophrastus,\r\nthe Greek philosopher, wrote a hundred years before \"the vine cannot\r\nbe grafted upon itself.\" However, until it became necessary to grow\r\nVinifera grapes on resistant stocks to avoid the ravages of\r\nphylloxera, grafting the grape was not at all common among\r\nvineyardists and is not now except where vines susceptible to\r\nphylloxera must be grown in consort with roots resistant to this\r\ninsect, or to modify the vigor of the top by a stock more vigorous or\r\nless vigorous. For these two purposes, grafting is now in some grape\r\nregions one of the most important vineyard operations.\r\n\r\nIn grafting the grape, there is a time and a way, not so particular as\r\nmany believe, but rather more particular than in grafting most other\r\nfruits. If the essentials of grafting are kept in mind, one has\r\nconsiderable choice of details. Grafting consists in detaching and\r\ninserting one or several buds of a mother plant on another plant of\r\nthe same or a similar kind; the bud stock is the cion, the rooted\r\nplant is the stock. The essentials may be set forth in three\r\nstatements: First, the prime essential is that the cambium layers, the\r\nhealing tissue lying between the bark and wood, meet in the cion and\r\nstock; second, that method of grafting is best in which the cut\r\ntissues heal most rapidly and most completely; third, the greater the\r\namount of cambium contact, as compared with the whole cut surface, the\r\nmore rapidly and completely the wounds will heal. Out of a great many,\r\nthe following are a few of the simplest methods in use in grafting the\r\ngrape, any one of which may be modified more or less as occasion\r\ncalls.\r\n\r\n_Vineyard grafting in eastern America._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. Cutting off the trunk.]\r\n\r\nIn eastern America, the growing vine is usually grafted. At the New\r\nYork Agricultural Experiment Station, the operation is very\r\nsuccessfully performed on old vines as follows: Preparatory to\r\ngrafting, the earth is removed from around the stock to a depth of two\r\nor three inches. The vines are then decapitated at the surface of the\r\nground and at right angles with the axis of the stock. If the grain is\r\nstraight, the cleft can be made by splitting with a chisel, but more\r\noften it will have to be done with a thin-bladed saw through the\r\ncenter of the stock for at least two inches. The cion is cut with two\r\nbuds, the wedge being started at the lower bud. The cleft in the stock\r\nis then opened, and the cion inserted so that the cambium of stock and\r\ncion are in intimate contact. If the stock is large, two cions are\r\nused. The several operations in grafting are shown in Figs. 8, 9, 10\r\nand 11. Grafting wax is unnecessary, in fact is often worse than\r\nuseless, and if the stock is large the graft is not even tied. Raffia\r\nis used to tie the graft in young vines. It suffices to mound the\r\ngraft to the top of the cion with earth, for the purposes of\r\nprotection and to keep the graft moist. Two or three times during the\r\nsummer, sprouts coming from the stock or roots from the cion should be\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. Cutting the cleft.]\r\n\r\nA method used with fair success at the New York Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station with young vines is to plant one-year-old stocks in\r\nthe nursery row as soon as the ground can be worked in the spring.\r\nJust as the vines start in growth, these are cut off at the surface of\r\nthe ground and whip- or cleft-grafted with a two-eye cion. The graft\r\nis tied with raffia, after which it is all but covered with a mound of\r\nsoil. This is a case in which the work must be done at the accepted\r\ntime, as it is fatal to delay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. Inserting the cion.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. The completed graft.]\r\n\r\nR. D. Anthony describes another method as follows:[2] \"A method which\r\na Pennsylvania grower of Viniferas has found very satisfactory is to\r\nroot the Vinifera cuttings, and grow them one year on their own roots;\r\nthen the vine which is to be used as a stock is planted in the\r\nvineyard and the rooted cutting planted beside it so that the shoots\r\nfrom the two may be brought in contact with each other. In June when\r\nthe plants are in full growth, two vigorous shoots (one from each\r\nvine) are brought together and a cut two or three inches long made in\r\neach parallel to the length of the cane removing from one-third to\r\none-half of the thickness of the shoot. These flat surfaces exposed\r\nby the cuts are then brought into contact with the cambium tissues\r\ntouching and are tied in place. The tops are checked somewhat by\r\nbreaking off some of the growth. The following spring the Vinifera\r\nroots are cut off below the graft and the top of the stock above the\r\ngraft is removed.\"\r\n\r\nIn the subsequent care of these young vines, the grower must take time\r\nby the forelock and tie the grafts to suitable stakes; otherwise they\r\nare liable to be broken off at the union by wind or careless workmen.\r\nGrafted vineyards must have extra good care in all cultural\r\noperations, and even with the best of care from 5 to 50 per cent of\r\nthe grafts will fail or grow so poorly as to make regrafting\r\nnecessary, this being the most unfavorable circumstance of field\r\ngrafting. Regrafting is done one joint lower than the first operation\r\nto avoid dead wood; this brings the union below the surface of the\r\nground, and the vineyardist must expect many cion roots to try his\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n_Vineyard grafting on the Pacific slope._\r\n\r\nVineyard grafting, according to Bioletti,[3] was formerly the\r\ncommonest method of starting resistant vineyards in California. After\r\nstating that it is best whenever possible to plant good cuttings\r\nrather than roots, and that the grafting should usually be done the\r\nyear after planting, Bioletti gives the following directions for\r\ngrafting:[4]\r\n\r\n\"Wherever possible the vines should be grafted at or above the surface\r\nof the ground. In many cases, however, it will be necessary to go\r\nbelow the surface to find a smooth, suitable part of the stock where\r\ngrafting is possible.\r\n\r\n\"The kind of graft to use will depend on the size of the stock. For\r\nstocks up to 2/3 inch in diameter the methods of tongue and wire\r\ngrafting already described are the best. For larger vines up to 3/4\r\ninch a modification of the ordinary tongue graft is the best. If the\r\ntongue graft were made in the usual way with stocks of this size, it\r\nwould be necessary to use excessively large scions, which is\r\nundesirable, or to have the barks unite only on one side. By cutting\r\nthe bevel of the stock only part way through the vines, it is possible\r\nto make a smaller scion unite on both sides. For still larger vines,\r\nthose over 3/4 inch in diameter, the best graft is the ordinary cleft.\r\n\r\n\"No wax or clay should be used on the graft. Anything which completely\r\nexcludes the air prevents the knitting of the tissues. A little clay,\r\ncloth, or a leaf may be placed over the split in the stock when the\r\ncleft graft is used, simply to keep out the soil. Otherwise there is\r\nnothing more suitable or more favorable to the formation of a good\r\nunion that can be put around the graft than loose, moist soil. If the\r\nsoil is clayey, stiff or lumpy, it is necessary to surround the union\r\nwith loose soil or sand brought from outside the vineyard.\r\n\r\n\"It will usually be necessary to tie the grafts. A well-made cleft\r\ngraft often holds the scion with sufficient force to prevent its\r\ndisplacement and no tying is necessary. Wherever there is any danger\r\nof the graft moving, however, it should be tied. There is nothing\r\nbetter for this purpose than ordinary raffia. The raffia should not be\r\nbluestoned, as it will last long enough without and will be sure to\r\nrot in a few weeks, and the trouble of cutting it will be avoided.\r\nCotton string or anything which will keep the graft in place for a few\r\nweeks may also be used.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the graft is made and tied, a stake should be driven and\r\nthe union covered with a little earth. The hilling up of the graft may\r\nbe left for a few hours, except in very hot, dry weather. Finally, the\r\nwhole graft should be covered with a broad hill of loose soil 2 inches\r\nabove the top of the scion.\r\n\r\n\"Field grafting should not be commenced as a rule, except in the\r\nhottest and driest localities, before the middle of March. Before\r\nthat there is too much danger that heavy rains may keep the soil\r\nsoaked for several weeks--a condition very unfavorable to the\r\nformation of good unions. In any case the grafting should not be done\r\nwhile the soil is wet. Grafting may continue as long as the cuttings\r\ncan be kept dormant. It is difficult to graft successfully, however,\r\nwhen the bark of the stock becomes loose, as it does soon after the\r\nmiddle of April in most localities.\"\r\n\r\nAs in the East, it is necessary in California to remove suckers from\r\nthe roots and roots from the cions once or twice during the summer.\r\nSuckers should not be allowed to overshade the graft, though it is\r\nbest not to remove them until danger of disturbing the graft is past.\r\nThe grafts should be staked and the vines looked after as recommended\r\nfor eastern conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III.--Cover-crops. _Top_, cow-horn turnips;\r\n_bottom_, rye.]\r\n\r\n_Bench grafting._\r\n\r\nThe resistant vineyards of France and California are now started\r\nalmost entirely with bench-grafted vines. It has been learned in these\r\nregions that a grafted vine, to be a permanent success, must have the\r\nconsorting parts perfectly united, and that the sooner the grafting is\r\ndone in the life of stock and cion the better the union. Cions of the\r\nvariety wanted are, therefore, grafted on resistant roots or resistant\r\ncuttings in the workshop and then planted in the nursery. Bench\r\ngrafting has the advantage over field grafting in time gained and in\r\nsecuring a fuller stand of vines.\r\n\r\nBench grafting really begins with the selection of cuttings, since\r\nsuccess largely depends on good cuttings of both stock and cion.\r\nCuttings are taken from strong healthy vines and are of medium size,\r\nwith short to medium joints. The best size is one-third of an inch in\r\ndiameter, that of stock and cion being the same since the two must\r\nmatch exactly. The cutting-wood may be taken from the mother vines at\r\nany time during the dormant season up to two weeks before buds swell\r\nin the spring, and the cuttings can then be made as convenience\r\ndictates, though meanwhile the wood must be kept cool and moist, which\r\nis best done by covering them with moist but not wet soil or sand in a\r\ncellar or cool shed. In California, the best results are obtained when\r\nthe grafting is done in February or March, though it may be begun\r\nearlier and continued a month later.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of cuttings._\r\n\r\nThe stocks are cut into lengths of about ten inches, a gauge being\r\nused to secure uniform length. The cut at the bottom is made through a\r\nbud in such a way as to leave the diaphragm. The top cut is made as\r\nnear ten inches from the bottom as possible, leaving about one and\r\none-half inches above the top bud for convenience in grafting. The\r\nstock is then disbudded, taking both visible and adventitious buds,\r\nthe latter indicated by woody enlargements, to keep down the number of\r\nsuckers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. Bench-grafted cuttings of grape, showing both\r\nthe cleft-graft and the whip-graft.]\r\n\r\nThe cion should be made with but one bud, thereby gaining the\r\nadvantage of having every cion the same length so that all unions are\r\nat the same distance below the surface of the ground in the nursery.\r\nThe cion is made with about two and one-half inches of internode below\r\nthe bud and one-half inch above, a sharp knife being the best tool for\r\nmaking the cuts.\r\n\r\nStock and cion cuttings are now graded to exactly the same diameters,\r\nthis being necessary to secure perfection in the unions. Three\r\nmethods of uniting stock and cion are illustrated in Fig. 12. It\r\nsuffices to grade by the eye into three lots--large, small and\r\nmedium--but some nurserymen prefer to secure even greater accuracy by\r\nthe use of any one of several mechanical gauges. The methods of\r\nuniting stock and cion may be described best by quoting Bioletti, from\r\nwhom most of the details already given have been summarized:[5]\r\n\r\n_Tongue grafting._\r\n\r\n\"When the stocks and scions are prepared and graded the grafter takes\r\na box of stocks and a box of the corresponding size of scions and\r\nunites them. Each is cut at the same angle in such a way that when\r\nplaced together the cut surface of one exactly fits and covers the\r\nwhole of the cut surface of the other. The length of cut surface\r\nshould be from three to four times the diameter of the cutting, the\r\nshorter cut for the larger sizes and the longer for the thinner. This\r\nwill correspond to an angle of from 14.5 to 19.5 degrees. The cut\r\nshould be made with a sliding movement of the knife. This will make\r\nthe cut more easily and more smoothly.\r\n\r\n\"The cut should be made with a single quick motion of the knife. If\r\nthe first cut is not satisfactory, a completely new one should be\r\nmade. There should be no paring of the cut, as this will make an\r\nirregular or wavy surface and prevent the cuttings coming together\r\nclosely in all parts.\r\n\r\n\"The tongues are made with a slow, sliding motion of the knife. They\r\nare commenced slightly above one-third of the distance from the sharp\r\nend of the bevel and cut down until the tongue is just a trifle more\r\nthan one-third the length of the cut surface. The tongue should be\r\n_cut_, not _split_. The knife should not follow the grain of the wood,\r\nbut should be slanted in such a way that the tongue will be about\r\none-half as thick as it would be if made by splitting. Before\r\nwithdrawing the knife it is bent over in order to open out the\r\ntongue. This very much facilitates the placing together of stock and\r\nscion.\r\n\r\n\"The stock and scion are now placed together and, if everything has\r\nbeen done properly, there will be no cut surface visible and the\r\nextremity of neither stock nor scion will project over the cut surface\r\nof the other. It is much better that the points should not quite reach\r\nthe bottom of the cut surface than that they should overlap, as the\r\nunion will be more complete and the scions will be less liable to\r\nthrow out roots. If the points do overlap, the overlapping portion\r\nshould be cut off, as in the Champin grafts.\r\n\r\n\"A skillful grafter, by following the above-described method, will\r\nmake grafts most of which will hold together very firmly. Many of them\r\nwould be displaced, however, in subsequent operations, so that it is\r\nnecessary to tie them. This is done with raffia or waxed string. The\r\nonly object of the tying is to keep the stock and scion together until\r\nthey unite by the growth of their own tissues, so that the less\r\nmaterial used the better, provided this object is attained. For the\r\nformation of healing tissue air is necessary, so that clay, wax,\r\ntinfoil or anything that would exclude the air should not be used. The\r\ntying material is passed twice around the point of the scion to hold\r\nit down firmly, and then with one or two wide spirals it is carried to\r\nthe point of the stock, which is fastened firmly with two more turns\r\nand the end of the string passed under the last turn. The less string\r\nis used the more easily it is removed later in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\"Untreated raffia should be used for late grafts which are to be\r\nplanted directly out in the nursery, but if the grafts are to be\r\nplaced first in a callusing bed it is best to bluestone the raffia in\r\norder to prevent rotting before the grafts are planted. This is done\r\nby steeping the bundles of raffia in a three per cent solution of\r\nbluestone for a few hours and then hanging them up to dry. Before\r\nusing, the raffia should be washed quickly in a stream of water in\r\norder to remove the bluestone which has crystallized on the outside\r\nand which might corrode the graft.\r\n\r\n\"Some grafters prefer waxed string for grafting. The string should be\r\nstrong enough to hold the graft, but thin enough to be broken by hand.\r\nNo. 18 knitting cotton is a good size. It is waxed by soaking the\r\nballs in melted grafting wax for several hours. The string will absorb\r\nthe wax, and may then be placed on one side until needed. A good wax\r\nfor this purpose is made by melting together one part of tallow, two\r\nparts of beeswax, and three parts of rosin.\"\r\n\r\n_Wire grafting._\r\n\r\n\"The merits claimed for this method are that it is more rapid,\r\nrequires less skill, and does away with the troublesome tying and\r\nstill more troublesome removal of the tying material. Practiced\r\ngrafters can obtain as large a percentage of No. 1 unions by this\r\nmethod as by any other, and unpracticed grafters can do almost as well\r\nas practiced. Another advantage of the method is that the scions have\r\nless tendency to make roots than with the tongue graft.\r\n\r\n\"It consists essentially of the use of a short piece of galvanized\r\niron wire inserted in the pith of stock and scion for the purpose of\r\nholding them together, thus replacing both tongues and raffia. It has\r\nbeen objected that the iron would have a deleterious effect on the\r\ntissues of the graft, corroding them, or causing them to decay. There\r\nseems, however, no reason to expect any such result, and vines grafted\r\nin this way have been bearing for years without showing any such\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\"The preparation and grading of stocks and scions are exactly the same\r\nfor this method as for the tongue graft.\r\n\r\n\"Stock and scion are cut at an angle of 45 degrees. A piece of\r\ngalvanized iron wire two inches long is then pushed one inch into the\r\nfirmest pith. This will usually be the pith of the stock, but it will\r\ndepend on the varieties being grafted. The scion is then pushed on to\r\nthe wire and pressed down until it is in contact with the stock. If\r\nthe cuttings have large pith it is better to use two pieces of wire,\r\none placed in the stock first and the other in the scion.\r\n\r\n\"The length of wire to use will vary with the size and firmness of the\r\ncuttings, but 2 inches will usually be found most satisfactory. Wire\r\nof No. 17 gauge is the most useful size.\"\r\n\r\n_Making bundles._\r\n\r\n\"If the grafts are to be planted out directly in the nursery, they may\r\nbe simply laid in boxes or trays, covered with damp sacks, and carried\r\nout to be planted as soon as made. It is usually better, however, to\r\nplace them for several weeks in a callusing bed before planting. In\r\nthis case it is necessary for convenience of handling to tie them up\r\ninto bundles. No more than twenty grafts should be placed in a bundle,\r\nand ten is better. If the bundles are too large there is danger of the\r\ngrafts in the middle becoming moldy or dry.\r\n\r\n\"A stand is very convenient. It consists of a piece of board 12\r\ninches, on one end of which is nailed a cleat 6 inches by 4 inches and\r\nunder the other end a support of the same size. Two 4-inch wire nails\r\nare driven through the board from below, 4 inches apart and 5 inches\r\nfrom the cleat. Two other 4-inch nails are driven similarly at 1-1/2\r\ninches from the other end. The grafts are laid on this stand with the\r\nscions resting against the cleat, and are then tied with the two\r\npieces of bluestoned raffia that have previously been placed above\r\neach pair of nails. This arrangement insures all the scions, and\r\ntherefore the unions, being at the same level, and puts both ties\r\nbelow the union where they will not strain the graft. The tying is\r\nmore expeditious and less liable to disturb the unions than if the\r\nbundles are made without a guide.\r\n\r\n\"A skillful grafter will make about one hundred tongue grafts on\r\ncuttings per hour, or from sixty-five to seventy-five per hour if he\r\ndoes the tying as well. Wire grafts can be made at the rate of two\r\nhundred and fifty or more per hour, and by proper division of labor\r\nwhere several grafters are employed this number can be easily\r\nexceeded. These estimates do not include the preparation and grading\r\nof the cuttings.\"\r\n\r\n_Grafting rooted cuttings._\r\n\r\nThe cion may be grafted on a stock rooted in the nursery the previous\r\nseason, much the same methods being used as with cuttings. This method\r\nis employed to utilize cuttings too small to graft, the added sizes\r\nattained in the nursery making them large enough, and in grafting on\r\nstocks which root with difficulty, thus saving the making of grafts\r\nwhich never grow. The stocks, in this method, are cut so that the\r\ncions may be inserted as the original cutting and not as the new\r\ngrowth. The roots, for convenience in handling, are cut back to an\r\ninch or thereabouts in length.\r\n\r\n_The callusing bed._\r\n\r\nIf bench grafts are planted at once in the nursery, most of them fail.\r\nThey are, therefore, stratified in a callusing bed where moisture and\r\ntemperature can be controlled. Bioletti describes a callusing bed and\r\nits use as follows:[6]\r\n\r\n\"This callusing bed is usually a pile of clean sand placed on the\r\nsouth side of a wall or building and surrounded by a board partition\r\nwhere there is no possibility of its becoming too wet by the flow of\r\nwater from a higher level or from an overhanging roof. It should be\r\nprotected, if necessary, by a surrounding ditch. It should be\r\nfurnished with a removable cover of canvas or boards to protect it\r\nfrom rain and to enable the temperature to be controlled by the\r\nadmission or exclusion of the sun's rays. A water-proof wagon-cover,\r\nblack on one side and white on the other, is excellent for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\"The bottom of the callusing bed is first covered with 2 or 3 inches\r\nof sand. The bundles of grafts are then placed in a row along one end\r\nof the bed, and sand well filled in around them. The bundles should be\r\nplaced in a slightly inclined position with the scions uppermost, and\r\nthe sand should be dry enough so that it sifts in between the grafts\r\nin the bundle. The bundles of grafts are then covered up completely\r\nwith sand, leaving it at least 2 inches deep above the top of the\r\nscion. Another row is then placed in the same manner until the bed is\r\nfull. Finally a layer of 2 or 3 inches of moss or straw is placed over\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"In the callusing bed we should endeavor to hasten and perfect the\r\nunion of stock and scion as much as possible while delaying the\r\nstarting of the buds and the emission of the roots. The latter\r\nprocesses require more moisture than the formation of healing tissue,\r\ntherefore the sand should be kept comparatively dry. Between 5 and 10\r\nper cent of water in the sand is sufficient. The purer the sand the\r\nless water is necessary. There should be a little more moisture\r\npresent than in the sand used for keeping the cuttings over winter.\r\nToo much moisture will stimulate the emission of roots and starting of\r\nbuds without aiding the callus formation.\r\n\r\n\"All the vital processes progress more rapidly when the cuttings are\r\nkept warm. To delay them, therefore, we keep the sand cool, and to\r\nhasten them we make it warm. In the beginning of the season and up to\r\nthe middle of March we keep the sand cool. This is done by keeping the\r\nbed covered during the day when the sun is shining, and uncovering\r\noccasionally at night when there is no fear of rain. If the\r\nblack-and-white wagon-cover is used, the white side should be placed\r\noutward to reflect the heat. The temperature should be kept about 60°\r\nF. or lower.\r\n\r\n\"About the middle of March the temperature of the bed should be\r\nraised. This is done by removing the cover during warm days and\r\ncarefully covering at night. If necessary the layer of moss or straw\r\nshould be removed on sunny days and then replaced. The temperature of\r\nthe sand at the level of the unions should be about 75° F. during this\r\nperiod. If the temperature rises higher than this, there will be a\r\nmore abundant production of callus, but it will be soft, easily\r\ninjured, and liable to decay.\r\n\r\n\"At the end of four weeks after warming the bed, the union should be\r\nwell cemented. The callus should not only have formed copiously around\r\nthe whole circumference of the wound, but it should have acquired a\r\ncertain amount of toughness due to the formation of fibrous tissue. It\r\nshould require a pull of several pounds to break the callus and\r\nseparate stock and scion. When the callus has acquired this quality\r\nthe grafts are in condition to be planted in the nursery, and may be\r\nhandled without danger. If taken from the bed while the callus is\r\nstill soft, many unions will be injured and the grafts will fail, or\r\nunite only on one side.\r\n\r\n\"If left as long as this in the callusing bed most of the scion buds\r\nwill have started and formed white shoots. These shoots, however,\r\nshould not be more than 1/2 to 1 inch long. If they are longer the bed\r\nhas been kept too wet or too warm. Roots will also have started from\r\nthe stock, but these also should not be over 1/2 inch long. The grafts\r\nshould be handled as carefully as is practicable, but there is no\r\nobjection to breaking off any scion shoots or stock roots which have\r\ngrown too long. It is almost impossible to save them, and new ones\r\nwill start after the grafts are planted, and make a perfectly\r\nsatisfactory growth.\"\r\n\r\n_Care in the nursery._\r\n\r\nThe grafts are planted in the nursery, and are given much the same\r\ncare recommended for cuttings. They may be set in trenches made with\r\nplow or spade; or they may be planted in very shallow trenches with a\r\ndibble. After planting, the grafts are covered with an inch or two of\r\nsoil, thus forming a wide ridge in the nursery row with the union of\r\nthe grafts at the original level of the soil. Cultivation should begin\r\nat once and be frequent enough to prevent the formation of a crust, in\r\norder that the young shoots may not have difficulty in forcing their\r\nway through the soil. Roots start on the cions sooner than on the\r\nstock, the soil being warmer at the surface, and help sustain the\r\ncions until the stocks are well rooted, at which time all roots\r\nstarted on the cion are removed, and at the same time the tying\r\nmaterial is cut if it has not rotted. Suckers are removed as soon as\r\nthey show above ground. The grafts are dug as soon as the leaves fall\r\nand the young vines become dormant, after which they are sorted in\r\nthree lots, according to size of top and root, and heeled-in in a cool\r\nmoist place until they are to be planted.\r\n\r\n_Nursery_ versus _home-grown vines._\r\n\r\nThe verdict of all vineyardists is that it is better to buy\r\nnursery-grown vines than to attempt to grow them. The high quality of\r\nthe vines which can be purchased and the reasonable purchase price\r\nmake it hardly worth while to try home-grown vines, especially since\r\nconsiderable investment, experience and skill are required to grow\r\ngood vines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"PEDIGREED\" GRAPE VINES\r\n\r\nMany viticulturists, in common with orchardists, believe that their\r\nplants should be propagated only from parents which have good\r\ncharacters, that is, are vigorous, healthy, productive, and bear fruit\r\nof large size, perfect form, good color and good quality. They\r\nbelieve, in short, that varieties can be improved by bud selection.\r\nThere is, however, but little in either theory or fact to\r\nsubstantiate the belief of those who say that varieties once\r\nestablished can be improved; or, on the other hand, that they\r\ndegenerate. Present knowledge and experience indicate that heredity is\r\nall but complete in varieties propagated from parts of plants. The\r\nmultitude of grapes in any variety, all from one seed, are\r\nmorphologically one individual. A few kinds of grapes go back to\r\nChrist's time, and these seem to agree almost perfectly with the\r\ndescriptions of them made by Roman writers 2000 years ago. How, then,\r\ncan the differences between vines of a variety in every vineyard in\r\nthe land be explained?\r\n\r\nAmple explanation is found in \"nurture\" to account for the variation\r\nin vines without involving a change in \"Nature.\" Soil, sunlight,\r\nmoisture, insects, disease, plant-food, and the stock in the case of\r\ngrafted vines, give every vine a distinct environment and hence a\r\ndistinct individuality of its own. Peculiarities in a vine appear and\r\ndisappear with the individual. A variety can be changed temporarily by\r\nits environment, but remove the incidental forces and it snaps back\r\ninto its same old self.\r\n\r\nHeredity is not quite complete in the grape, however; for, now and\r\nthen, sports or mutations appear which are permanent and, if\r\nsufficiently different, become a strain of the parent variety or\r\npossibly a new variety. There are several such sports of the Concord\r\nunder cultivation. The grape-grower can tell these sports from the\r\nmodifications brought about by environment only by propagation. If a\r\nvariation is transmitted unchanged through successive generations of\r\nthe grape, as occasionally happens, it may be looked on as a new form.\r\n\"Pedigreed\" vines, then, should be subject to a test of several\r\ngenerations in an experimental vineyard before the grape-grower pays\r\nthe price demanded for the supposed improvement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV.--A well-tilled vineyard of Concords.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSTOCKS AND RESISTANT VINES\r\n\r\n\r\nPhylloxera, a tiny root-louse, made its appearance in France in 1861\r\nand began multiplying with a fury unparalleled in the insect world. By\r\n1874, the pest had become so widespread in Europe that it threatened\r\nthe very existence of the great vineyard industry of that continent.\r\nAll attempts to bring the pest under control failed, although the\r\nFrench government offered a reward of 300,000 francs for a\r\nsatisfactory remedy. Numerous methods of treating the soil to check\r\nthe ravages of the insect were tried, also, but none was efficacious.\r\nFinally, it dawned on European vineyardists that phylloxera is not a\r\nscourge in America, its habitat, and that European vineyards might be\r\nsaved by grafting Vinifera vines on the roots of immune American\r\ngrapes. At once the reconstruction of vineyards in Europe was begun by\r\ngrafting the grapes on phylloxera-resistant roots. Meanwhile,\r\nconsternation spread to California when it was discovered that\r\nphylloxera was running riot in some of the vineyards of the Pacific\r\nslope; however, with the knowledge derived from viticulturists in\r\nEurope, they too began reconstructing vineyards on immune roots,\r\nwithout the same success as the Europeans, it is true, but with such\r\nmeasure of success that it soon became the approved method of growing\r\ngrapes in this great region.\r\n\r\nThrough the use of resistant stocks, phylloxera is now defied in\r\nVinifera regions. Millions of American stocks are annually struck at\r\nhome, in Europe and wherever Vinifera grapes are grown, to be\r\ntop-worked with varieties susceptible to phylloxera. Seldom has\r\nmastery over a pest been so complete; but, to triumph over the tiny\r\ninsect, the industry has had to be revolutionized. Resistant stocks,\r\nin their turn, brought innumerable new problems, many of which are\r\nstill unsolved. Investigations and experiences in rehabilitating\r\nvineyards have been carried on for forty years, the results set forth\r\nin books and bulletins and yet there are many problems to be solved.\r\nThe grape-grower in regions infested with phylloxera is always under\r\nthe necessity of taking advantage of the latest demonstration of\r\npractices in the use of resistant stocks. These practices are best\r\nstudied in the experiments of state experiment stations and the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture, and in the vineyards of leading\r\ngrape-growers, since even those most needing elucidation can be but\r\nbriefly discussed in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe wild vines of a species are always seedlings and are hence\r\nexceedingly variable. The first vineyards of resistant stocks were\r\nvines grafted on stocks of wild vines, and the results were very\r\nunsatisfactory; for, naturally, there was divergence in many\r\ncharacters and especially in the vigor of the vines. Also, there was\r\ndifficulty in grafting, since some wild vines are stout and others\r\nslender; some bear grafts well, while others do not. It soon became\r\napparent that to succeed, varieties must be selected from the\r\ndifferent species for vineyard work. The great task of the\r\nexperimenter and grape-grower, therefore, has been to select varieties\r\nof the several species sufficiently resistant, vigorous and otherwise\r\npossessed of characters fitting them to become good stocks. Out of\r\nvast numbers tested, a few are now generally recognized as best for\r\nthe several groups of Vinifera grapes and the several distinct regions\r\nin which these grapes are grown.\r\n\r\n_Resistant species and varieties._\r\n\r\nThe reconstruction of phylloxera-ridden vineyards by the use of\r\nresistant stocks is possible only because some species and varieties\r\nare, as has been said, more resistant to the root-louse than others.\r\nAll degrees of resistance exist, as would be suspected, from immunity\r\nto great susceptibility. It is obvious that the foundation of the art\r\nof growing resistant vineyards is exact knowledge of the immunities\r\nand susceptibilities of the many varieties and species of grapes. From\r\nthe first use of resistant vines, experimenters everywhere have set\r\nthemselves at work to determine not only what the most resistant vines\r\nare, but what the causes and conditions of immunity. In spite of a\r\nwealth of empirical discoveries as to what grapes can best resist the\r\nroot-louse, causes and most of the conditions of immunity are still\r\nlittle understood. Definite, useful knowledge, so far, goes little\r\nfurther than the establishment of lists of species and varieties, the\r\nlatter subject to change, that are most useful in setting resistant\r\nvineyards.\r\n\r\nPhylloxera does little damage to species of Vitis native to the same\r\ngeneral region in which the pest has its habitat, but nevertheless\r\nthere are some differences in resistance in American grapes. Munson,\r\none of the best American authorities on the resistance of species to\r\nphylloxera, says:[7] \"Rotundifolia is entirely immune, then Rupestris,\r\nVulpina, Cinerea, Berlandieri, Champini, Candicans, Doaniana,\r\nÆstivalis and Lincecumii are so high in resistance as to be\r\npractically uninjured, though they may be attacked, while Labrusca is\r\nlow in resistance and is much weakened in clay soils, if infested, and\r\nVinifera is entirely non-resistant.\" Some of these species are hard to\r\npropagate and difficult to suit in soil and climate so that but two of\r\nthem are much used for resistant stocks. The two most used are\r\nRupestris and Vulpina (Riparia), of both of which there are varieties\r\nwhich give satisfaction. Bioletti, a leading authority on resistant\r\nstocks in California, says:[8]\r\n\r\n\"Varieties of resistant stocks which will in all probability be used\r\nin California are Rupestris St. George (du Lot), Riparia × Rupestris\r\n3306, Riparia × Rupestris 3309, Riparia Solonis 1616, Mourvèdre ×\r\nRupestris 1202, Aramon × Rupestris 2, Riparia gloire, and Riparia\r\ngrande glabre. These are all varieties which have given excellent\r\nvarieties for years in Europe, and have all been tested successfully\r\nin California. Among them are varieties suitable for nearly all the\r\nvineyard soils of California, with perhaps the exception of some of\r\nthe heavier clays.\r\n\r\n\"The only one of these varieties which has been planted extensively in\r\nCalifornia is the Rupestris St. George. There can be little doubt,\r\nhowever, that it will fail to give satisfaction in many soils, and\r\nthough we may not find something better for all our soils it is\r\nprobable that we will repeat the experience of Southern France and\r\nfind that in most soils there is some other variety that gives better\r\nresults. Without attempting to describe these varieties, but to give\r\nsome idea of their merits and defects and of the soils most suited to\r\neach, the following indications are given, based principally on the\r\nopinions of L. Ravaz and Prosper Gervais, and on a still limited\r\nexperience in California:\r\n\r\n\"The Rupestris St. George is remarkably vigorous and grows very large,\r\nsupporting the graft well even without stakes. It roots easily and\r\nmakes excellent unions with most vinifera varieties. It is well suited\r\nto deep soils where its roots can penetrate. Its defects are that it\r\nis very subject to root-rot, especially in moist soils; it suckers\r\nbadly and it suffers from drought in shallow soils. Its great vigor\r\nproduces coulure with some varieties and often necessitates long\r\npruning.\r\n\r\n\"In moist or wet soils 1616 or 3306 had given better results in France\r\nand gives indications of doing equally well here. In drier soils 3309\r\nwill probably be found preferable.\r\n\r\n\"Aramon Rupestris No. 2 is suited to the same soils as Rupestris St.\r\nGeorge, and does particularly well in extremely gravelly soils. It\r\nhas some of the defects of the St. George and is moreover more\r\ndifficult to graft, and its only advantage in California is that it is\r\nrather less susceptible to root-rot.\r\n\r\n\"There are no better resistant stocks than Riparia gloire and Riparia\r\ngrande glabre, wherever they are put in soils that suit them. They do\r\nwell, however, only in deep, rich, alluvial soils which are neither\r\ntoo wet nor too dry. Their grafts are the most productive of all, and\r\nripen their grapes from one to two weeks earlier than the grafts on\r\nSt. George. Their principal defect is that they are very particular as\r\nto the soil, and they never grow quite as large as the cion. The\r\ngloire is the most vigorous, and the difference of diameter is less\r\nwith this variety than with any other Riparia.\r\n\r\n\"The Mourvèdre × Rupestris 1202 is extremely vigorous, roots and\r\ngrafts easily, and is well adapted to rich, sandy and moist soils. In\r\ndrier and poorer soils its resistance is perhaps not sufficient.\r\n\r\n\"The most promising varieties for general use at present seem to be\r\nthe two hybrids of Riparia and Rupestris, 3306 and 3309. They have\r\ngreat resistance to the phylloxera, root and graft almost as easily as\r\nSt. George, and are quite sufficiently vigorous to support any variety\r\nof vinifera. The former is more suited to the moister soils and\r\nwherever there is danger of root-rot, and the latter to the drier\r\nsoils. In general, they are suited to a larger variety of soils and\r\ncondition than perhaps any other varieties.\r\n\r\n\"Riparia gloire should be planted only on rich, deep alluvial soil\r\ncontaining an abundance of plant food and humus, what would be called\r\ngood garden land, such as river bank soil not liable to overflow.\r\n\r\n\"In most other soils Riparia × Rupestris 3306 is to be recommended,\r\nexcept those that are rather dry, where 3309 is to be preferred, or\r\nthose which are very wet, where Solonis × Riparia 1616 is surer to\r\ngive good results.\"\r\n\r\nThe value of a species or variety for a resistant stock may be judged\r\nsomewhat by the visible effect of the phylloxera on the roots of the\r\nvines. On susceptible species, the punctures of the insects rapidly\r\nproduce swellings which vary in size and number in accordance with\r\nresistance of the species. Technically, the first swelling on the\r\nyoung tender rootlets of the vine is called a nodosity. The presence\r\nof a few nodosities on the root system does not indicate that a vine\r\nis not a valuable resistant stock. When the nodosity begins to decay\r\nand becomes of a cancerous nature, it is called a tuberosity. These\r\ntuberosities decay more or less rapidly and deeply, and when they rot\r\ndeeply cause enfeeblement or death to the vine. Thus, on Vinifera\r\nvarieties the tuberosities are several times larger and decay sets in\r\nmuch more quickly than on American species which show these\r\ntuberosities. Ratings as to resistance of species are usually made\r\nfrom the size and number of the tuberosities, though when these are\r\nfound producing a scab-like wound which scales off, there may be high\r\nresisting power.\r\n\r\nIn order to convey with some degree of definiteness the power of\r\nresistance to phylloxera, an arbitrary scale has been agreed on by\r\nviticulturists. In this scale, maximum resistance is indicated by 20\r\nand minimum by 0. Thus, the resisting power of a good Vulpina is put\r\nas 19.5 and that of a poor Vinifera variety as 0.\r\n\r\n\r\nADAPTATIONS OF RESISTANT STOCKS TO SOILS AND CLIMATES\r\n\r\nResistance, of course, counts for naught in a stock which comes from a\r\nspecies unsuited to the soil and climate or other circumstances of the\r\nlocality in which the vineyard is to be planted. The several species\r\nused for stocks differ widely in the requirements affecting growth so\r\nthat the grower must make certain that the resistant stock he selects\r\nwill find congenial surroundings. Stocks in congenial circumstances\r\nare frequently more resistant than others inherently more resistant,\r\nbut which are not otherwise adapted to the particular conditions of\r\nthe vineyard. Species of grapes vary greatly in their root systems,\r\nsome having thick, others slender roots; the roots of some are soft,\r\nof others hard; some have roots going down deeply, others are almost\r\nat the surface of the ground. Manifestly these various root-forms are\r\nbut adaptations to loose and heavy, dry and moist, deep and shallow\r\nsoils, or to some circumstance of climate. A vine bruised by adversity\r\nis in no condition to withstand phylloxera. Therefore, since the\r\nadaptability of a variety to a soil or climate may be changed by the\r\nstock, the adaptations of stocks to soils and climates must have\r\nattention.\r\n\r\n_Affinity of stock and cion._\r\n\r\nDifferent varieties of grapes do not behave alike on the same stocks,\r\nand different stocks may affect varieties differently. Even when the\r\nkinship is close, some grapes resist all the appliances of art to make\r\na successful union; while, on the other hand, quite distinct species\r\noften seem foreordained to be joined. For example, Rotundifolia, which\r\nhas the highest resistance to phylloxera of any species, is useless as\r\na stock because it is impossible to graft any other grape on it, while\r\nVulpina and Rupestris unite readily with varieties of Vinifera, the\r\nslight decrease in the vigor of the grafted vines serving oftentimes\r\nto increase fruitfulness. Something more is necessary, then, than\r\nbotanical kinship. Just what is necessary, no one knows, beyond: that\r\nthere must be conformity in habit between stock and cion; that the two\r\nmust start in growth at approximately the same time; and that the\r\ntissues must be sufficiently alike that there be proper contact in the\r\nunion. Yet these facts do not sufficiently explain all of the\r\naffinities and antipathies which species and varieties of grapes show\r\nto each other. Unfortunately, the grape-grower has had but little to\r\nguide him in selecting stocks and has had to learn by making repeated\r\ntrials.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPER PLANTING OF GRAFTED VINES\r\n\r\nEuropeans and Californians long ago learned that failures with grafted\r\nvines often came from setting the vines too deep in the soil, the\r\nresult being that the cions struck root and became independent,\r\nwhereupon the stock dies or becomes so moribund that the beneficial\r\neffects are lost. There are grape-growers who argue that it is\r\nbeneficial to the vine to have roots from both stock and cion, but\r\nexperience and experiments very generally teach the contrary, it being\r\nfound that in most grafts the cion roots grow more vigorously than\r\nstock roots and eventually starve out the latter. The disastrous\r\neffects of cion-rooting are often to be found, also, when grafting has\r\nbeen done on old vines in the vineyard; and, again, when the graft is\r\ntoo close to the root system.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of failure is that different stocks require that the\r\nvineyard soil be treated differently, especially at planting time.\r\nVulpina stocks require that the soil be much more deeply plowed than\r\nfor Viniferas on their own roots, since Vulpinas are deep-rooted and\r\nare exacting in the depth of root-run required. Those who have had\r\nmost experience with resistant stocks maintain that all American\r\ngrapes require rather deeper plowing than European grapes on their own\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF THE STOCKS ON THE CION\r\n\r\nUp to the present, the growing of grafted grapes has been carried on\r\nwith little thought of the mutual influence of stock and cion; grapes\r\nhave been grafted only to secure vines resistant to phylloxera. Yet\r\nthere can be no doubt that stock and cion react on one another, and\r\nthat any variety of grapes is influenced for better or worse in\r\ncharacters of vine and fruit by the stock upon which it is grafted. A\r\nplant is a delicate mechanism, easily thrown out of gear, and all\r\nplants, the grape not the least, are more or less changed in the\r\nadjustments of stock and cion. One could fill a large volume on the\r\nsupposed reciprocal influence of stock and cion in fruits. Space\r\nsuffices, here, however, to mention only those proved and those having\r\nto do with the influence of the stock on the cion when the grape is\r\ngrafted.\r\n\r\n_Influence of stocks on European grapes summarized._\r\n\r\nCommon experience in Europe and California indicates that varieties of\r\nVinifera grapes grafted on resistant stocks which are perfectly\r\nadapted to soil and climate produce not only larger crops but sweeter\r\nor sourer grapes; that the crop ripens earlier or later; that the vine\r\nis often more vigorous; and that there are some minor differences\r\ndepending on the stock used. Wine-makers assert that the character of\r\ntheir product may be affected for better or worse by the stock. Often\r\nvines are so improved by grafting that the extra expense of the\r\noperation and of the stock is paid for; although, to be sure, about as\r\noften the effects are deleterious. The successes and failures of\r\nvineyards on resistant stocks make plain that the vine-grower must\r\nstudy the many problems which stocks present and exercise utmost\r\nintelligence in the selection of the proper stock.\r\n\r\n_Influence of stocks on American grapes._\r\n\r\nNo doubt American species of grapes may be as profoundly modified by\r\nstocks as the European species, but there is but little evidence on\r\nthis phase of grape-growing to be drawn from the experience of\r\nvineyardists. One rather conclusive experiment, however, shows that\r\nAmerican grapes may be improved by growing them on stocks which give\r\nthem better adaptations to their environment. The experiment was tried\r\nin the Chautauqua grape-belt in western New York by the New York\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station. The test was carried on for eleven\r\nyears, during which time many interesting possibilities in grafting\r\ngrapes in this region came to light. It was proved that the stock\r\nmaterially affects the vigor and productiveness of the vine and the\r\nquality of the grapes. The following brief account is taken from\r\nBulletin No. 355 of the New York Station:\r\n\r\nIn this experiment a number of varieties were grafted on St. George,\r\nRiparia Gloire and Clevener stocks, and a fourth group on their own\r\nroots. The varieties grafted were: Agawam, Barry, Brighton, Brilliant,\r\nCampbell Early, Catawba, Concord, Delaware, Goff, Herbert, Iona,\r\nJefferson, Lindley, Mills, Niagara, Regal, Vergennes, Winchell and\r\nWorden. The planting plan and all of the vineyard operations were\r\nthose common in commercial vineyards.\r\n\r\nYearly accounts of the vineyard show that the vines passed through\r\nmany vicissitudes. The experiment was started in 1902 when St. George\r\nand Riparia Gloire stocks from California were set and grafted in the\r\nfield. Many of these died the first year. The winter of 1903-04 was\r\nunusually severe, and many more vines were either killed or so\r\nseverely injured that they died during the next two years. The vines\r\non St. George, a very deep-rooting grape, withstood the cold best.\r\nFidia, the grape root-worm, was found in the vineyards early in the\r\nlife of the vines and did much damage in some years. In the years of\r\n1907 and 1909 the crops were ruined by hail.\r\n\r\nBut despite these serious setbacks it was evident throughout the\r\nexperiment that the grafted grapes made better vines and were more\r\nproductive than those on their own roots. As an example of the\r\ndifferences in yield, a summary of the data for 1911 may be given. In\r\nthis year, an average of all the varieties on own roots yielded at the\r\nrate of 4.39 tons to the acre; on St. George, 5.36 tons; on Gloire,\r\n5.32 tons; on Clevener, 5.62 tons. The crops on the grafted vines\r\nwere increased through the setting of more bunches and the development\r\nof larger bunches and berries.\r\n\r\nThe grapes on the vines grafted on Gloire and Clevener ripened a few\r\ndays earlier than those on their own roots, while with St. George a\r\nfew varieties were retarded in ripening. Changing the time of maturity\r\nmay be very important in grape regions where there is danger of early\r\nfrost to late-ripening sorts, and where it is often desirable to\r\nretard the harvest time of early grapes.\r\n\r\nIn the behavior of the vines, the results correspond closely with\r\nthose given for yields. In the growth ratings of varieties on\r\ndifferent stocks, the varieties on their own roots were rated in vigor\r\nat 40; on St. George, at 63.2; on Gloire, at 65.2; on Clevener, at\r\n67.9. There is no way of deciding how much the thrift of the vines\r\ndepends on adaptability to soil, and how much on other factors. Since\r\nall of the varieties were more productive and vigorous on grafted\r\nvines than on their own roots it may be said that a high degree of\r\ncongeniality exists between the stocks and varieties under test.\r\n\r\nThe experiment suggests that it would be profitable to grow fancy\r\ngrapes of American species on grafted vines, and that it is well\r\nwithin the bounds of possibility that main-crop grapes can be grafted\r\nprofitably. In the general tuning-up of agriculture now in progress,\r\nit may be expected that soon American as well as European varieties of\r\ngrapes will be grown under some conditions and for some purposes on\r\nroots other than their own.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECT PRODUCERS\r\n\r\nAttempts innumerable have been and are still being made to secure, by\r\nhybridizing _V. vinifera_ and American species of grapes, varieties\r\nthat will resist phylloxera, the mildew and black-rot. The grapes of\r\nthis continent are relatively immune to all of these troubles, and if\r\nhybrids could be obtained to produce directly, without grafting,\r\ngrapes with the good qualities of the Viniferas--in short, European\r\ngrapes on American vines--the cultivated grape flora of the whole\r\nworld might be changed. So far, a \"direct producer\" that is wholly\r\nsatisfactory in either Europe or California has not been found for the\r\nwine or raisin industries, although a number of varieties are rated as\r\nvery good table grapes, and a few are used in wine-making. The best of\r\nthe direct producers are Lenoir, Taylor, Noah, Norton's Virginia,\r\nAutuchon, Othello, Catawba, and Delaware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V.--Vinifera grapes grown out of doors in New\r\nYork. _Top_, Malvasia; _bottom_, Chasselas Golden.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE VINEYARD AND ITS MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA vineyard is more artificial than other plantations of fruits, since\r\nthe vine requires greater discipline under cultivation than tree or\r\nbush. Yet greater art is required only when the attempt is made to\r\ngrow the grape to perfection, for the vine bears fruit if left to\r\nindulge in riotous growth wheresoever it can strike root. Vineyard\r\nmanagement, therefore, may represent the consummate art of three\r\nthousand or more years of cultural subserviency; or it may be so\r\nprimeval in simplicity as to approach neglect. The grape is so\r\nwonderfully responsive to good care, however, that no true lover of\r\nfruit will profane it with neglect, but will seek, rather, to give it\r\na favorable situation, its choice of soils and such generous care as\r\nwill insure strong, vigorous, productive vineyards of choicely good\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nGrape-growing is a specialists' business, for the culture of the grape\r\nis unlike that of any other fruit. The essentials of vineyard\r\nmanagement, however, are easily learned. Indeed, care of the vine\r\ncomes almost instinctively; for the grape has been cultivated since\r\nprehistoric times and the races of the world are so familiar with it\r\nthrough sacred literatures, myths, fables, stories and poetry, that\r\nits care is prompted by natural impulse. The grape has followed\r\ncivilized man so closely from place to place through the temperate\r\nclimates of the world, that rules and methods of culture have been\r\ndeveloped for almost every condition under which it will grow, so that\r\nevery grape-grower may profit by the successes and failures of the\r\ngenerations that preceded him. Grape-growing is not, however, an art\r\nwholly governed by rules of the past to be carried on by common\r\nlaborers who use hands only, but is one in which its followers may\r\nmake use of science and may put thought, skill and taste into their\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING OUT THE VINEYARD\r\n\r\nVineyards are laid out for the most part after accepted patterns for\r\neach of the great grape regions of America. The vines are always\r\nplanted in rectangles, usually at a less distance apart in the rows\r\nthan the rows are from each other, but sometimes in squares. Pride in\r\nappearance and convenience in vineyard operations make perfect\r\nalignment imperative. Many varieties of grapes, especially of American\r\nspecies, are partially self-sterile, so that some varieties must have\r\nothers interplanted with them for cross-pollination. This is usually\r\ndone by setting alternate rows of the variety to be pollinated and the\r\ncross-pollinator. All self-fertile varieties are set in solid blocks\r\nbecause of convenience in harvesting.\r\n\r\n_Direction of rows._\r\n\r\nSome grape-growers attach considerable importance to the direction in\r\nwhich rows run, holding either that the full blaze of the sun at\r\nmid-day is desirable for vine, soil and fruit, or that it is\r\ndetrimental. Those who desire to provide fullest exposure to the sun\r\nplant rows east and west when the distance between vines is less than\r\nthe distance between rows; north and south when vines are farther\r\napart in the row than the rows are from each other. When shade seems\r\nmore desirable, these directions are reversed. Most often, however,\r\nthe rows are laid out in accordance with the shape of the vineyard;\r\nor, if the land is hilly, the rows follow the contour of the\r\ndeclivities to prevent soil erosion by heavy rains.\r\n\r\n_Alleys._\r\n\r\nFor convenience in vineyard operations, especially spraying and\r\nharvesting, there should always be alleys through a vineyard. On hilly\r\nlands, the alleys are located to secure ease in hauling; on level\r\nlands they are usually arranged to cut the vineyards into blocks twice\r\nas long as wide. An alley is usually made by leaving out a row of\r\nvines. Many vineyards are laid out with rows far enough apart so that\r\nalleys are not needed.\r\n\r\n_Distances between rows and plants._\r\n\r\nThere are great variations in the distances between rows and plants in\r\ndifferent regions, and distances vary somewhat in any one region.\r\nDistances are influenced by the following considerations: Rich soils\r\nand large vigorous varieties require greater distances than poor soils\r\nand less vigorous varieties; sometimes, however, it is necessary to\r\ncrowd a variety in the vineyard so that by reducing its vigor\r\nfruitfulness may be promoted. Usually the warmer the climate, or the\r\nexposure, the greater should be the distance between vines. Very often\r\nthe topography of the land dictates planting distances. But while\r\ntaking in account the preceding considerations, which rightly suggest\r\nthe distances between plants in the row, convenience in vineyard\r\noperations is the factor that most often fixes the distance between\r\nrows. The rows must be far enough apart in commercial vineyards to\r\npermit the use of two horses in plowing, spraying and harvesting.\r\n\r\nPlanted in squares, the distance varies from seven feet in garden\r\nculture to nine feet in commercial vineyards for eastern America. More\r\noften, however, the rows are eight or nine feet apart, with the vines\r\nsix, seven or eight and in the South ten or twelve feet apart in the\r\nrows. Planting distances are less, as a rule, on the Pacific slope\r\nthan in eastern regions; that is, the distances between the rows are\r\nthe same, to permit work with teams, but the distance between plants\r\nin the rows is less, sometimes being no greater than three and a half\r\nor four feet. The rank-growing Rotundifolias of the southern states\r\nneed much room, nine by sixteen feet being none too much. Sunshine\r\nmust govern the distance apart somewhat. Grapes picked in the pleached\r\nalleys of closely set vineyards of the North and East are few, small\r\nand poor; farther south, shade from the vines may be a requisite for a\r\ngood crop.\r\n\r\nThe number of vines to the acre must be determined before growing or\r\nbuying plants. This is done by multiplying the distance in feet\r\nbetween the rows by the distance the plants are apart in the row, and\r\ndividing 43,560, the number of square feet in an acre, by the product.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR PLANTING\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to put too much emphasis on the necessity of thorough\r\npreparation of the land before planting the grape. Extra expenditure\r\nto secure good tilth is amply repaid by increased growth in the grape,\r\nand all subsequent care may fail to start the vines in vigorous growth\r\nif the land is not in good tilth preparatory to planting. The vineyard\r\nis to stand a generation or more, and its soil is virtually immortal,\r\ntwo facts to suggest perfect preparation. The land should be\r\nthoroughly well plowed, harrowed, mixed and smoothed. The better this\r\nwork is done, the greater the potentialities of the vineyard. Here,\r\nindeed, is a time to be mindful of the adage which comes from Cato, a\r\nsturdy old Roman grape-grower of 2000 years ago: \"The face of the\r\nmaster is good for the land.\"\r\n\r\nPreparation is a series of operations in which it is wise to take\r\nadvantage of time and begin a year before the vines are to be set. The\r\nland must be put in training to fit it for the long service it is to\r\nrender. The two great essentials of preparation are provision for\r\ndrainage and thorough cultivation. Both, to be performed as the\r\nwell-being of the grape require, take time, and a year is none too\r\nshort a period in which to do the work. Moreover, newly drained and\r\ndeeply plowed land requires time for frost, air, sunshine and rain to\r\nsweeten and enliven the soil after the mixture by these operations of\r\nlive topsoil with inert subsoil.\r\n\r\n_Drainage._\r\n\r\nThe ideal soil, as we are often told, resembles a sponge, and is\r\ncapable of retaining the greatest possible amount of plant-food\r\ndissolved in water, and at the same time is permeable for air. This\r\nideal, sponge-like condition is particularly desirable for the grape,\r\nespecially native species, because the vines of all are exceedingly\r\ndeep-rooted. Moreover, grapes thrive best in a warm soil. While,\r\ntherefore, the roots may make good use of nutritious solutions, if not\r\ntoo diluted, in an undrained soil, they suffocate and do not receive\r\nsufficient bottom heat. It must be made emphatic that the grape will\r\nnot thrive in water-logged land.\r\n\r\nUnless the land is naturally well drained, under-drainage must be\r\nprovided as the first step in the preparation of land for the\r\nvineyard. Tile-draining is usually best done by those who make\r\nland-draining their business, but information as to every requirement\r\nof land and detail of work may be secured from many texts, so that\r\ngrape-growers may perform the work for themselves. In concluding the\r\ntopic, the reader must be reminded that high and hill lands are not\r\nnecessarily well drained, and low lands are not necessarily wet even\r\nif the surface is level. Often hilltops and hillsides need artificial\r\ndraining; much less often valley lands and level lands may not need\r\nit. To assume, too, that gravelly and shaley soils are always well\r\ndrained often leads directly contrary to the truth. Sandy and gravelly\r\nsoils need drainage nearly as often as loamy and clayey ones.\r\n\r\nFollowing tiling, if the land has had to be under-drained, the\r\nvineyard should be graded to fill depressions and to make the surface\r\nuniform. Usually this can be done with cutaway, tooth or some other\r\nharrow, but sometimes the grader or road-scraper must be put in use.\r\n\r\n_Fitting the land._\r\n\r\nPreparatory cultivation should begin the spring preceding planting by\r\ndeep plowing. If the land has been used long for general farming so\r\nthat a hard plow-sole has been formed by years of shallow plowing, a\r\nsubsoil-plow should follow in the furrow of the surface plow, although\r\nit is seldom advisable to go deeply into the true hardpan. Fitting the\r\nland must not stop here but should continue through the summer with\r\nharrow and cultivator to pulverize the soil almost to its ultimate\r\nparticles. Such cultivation can be sufficiently thorough, and be made\r\nat the same time profitable, by growing some hoed crop which requires\r\nintensive culture. If the soil lacks humus, a cover-crop of clover or\r\nother legume might well be sown in early summer to be plowed under in\r\nlate fall. Or, if stable manure is available, this generally should be\r\napplied the fall before planting. Stable manure applied at this time\r\nto a soil inclined to be niggardly puts an atmosphere in the\r\nforthcoming vineyard wholly denied the grower who must rely on\r\ncommercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe land should be plowed again, deeply and as early in the fall as\r\npossible, harrowed thoroughly, or possibly cross-plowed and then\r\nharrowed. The land must go into the winter ready for early spring\r\nplanting and the fall work must be done promptly and with a sturdy\r\nteam and sharp, bright tools. The grower must keep in mind that no\r\nopportunity will offer during the life of the vineyard to even up for\r\nslackness in the start and that a vineyard of dingy, unhappy vines may\r\nbe the result of neglect at this critical time. Good tilth should\r\nproceed until the earth is fairly animated with growth when the vines\r\nare planted. Plate II shows a piece of land well fitted for planting.\r\n\r\n_Marking for planting._\r\n\r\nGiven level land, a well-made marker, a gentle team and a careful\r\ndriver with a surveyor's eye, and a vineyard may be marked for\r\nplanting with a sled-marker, a modified corn-marker or even a plow.\r\nSome such marker method is commonest in use in laying out vineyard\r\nrows, but it is patent to the eye of every passer-by in grape regions\r\nthat the commonest method is not the best to secure perfect alignment\r\nof row and vine. The combination named for good work with any of the\r\nmarker methods is found too seldom. If the marker method is used, it\r\nis put in practice as follows: The rows being marked at the distance\r\ndecided on, a deep furrow is plowed along the row by going both ways\r\nwith the plow; this done, small stakes are set in the furrow at the\r\nproper distances for the vines, taking care to line them both ways.\r\nPlanting holes are thus dug in the furrow with the stakes as a center.\r\n\r\nMarking by means of a measuring wire or chain is the best method of\r\nlocating vines accurately in a vineyard. The measuring wire varies\r\naccording to the wishes of the user from two to three hundred feet or\r\nmay be even longer. The best wires are made of annealed steel wire\r\nabout an eighth of an inch in diameter. At each end of the wire is a\r\nstrong iron ring to be slipped over stakes. The wire is marked\r\nthroughout its length by patches of solder at the distances desired\r\nbetween rows of vines; to make these places more easily seen, pieces\r\nof red cloth are fastened to them. Sometimes this measuring wire is\r\nmade of several strands of small wire, giving more flexibility and\r\nmaking marking easier, since by separating the strands at the desired\r\npoints, pieces of cloth may be tied to mark distances.\r\n\r\nIn using the wire, the side of the vineyard which is to serve as the\r\nbase of the square is selected and the wire is stretched, leaving at\r\nleast one rod from road or fence for a headland. With the wire thus\r\nstretched, a stake is placed at each of the distance tags to represent\r\nthe first row of vines. Beginning at the starting point, sixty feet\r\nare measured off in the base line and a temporary stake is set; eighty\r\nfeet at a right angle with the first line are then measured off at the\r\ncorner stake, judging the angle with the eye; then run diagonally from\r\nthe eighty-foot stake to the sixty-foot stake. If the distance between\r\nthe two stakes is one hundred feet, the corner is a right angle. With\r\nthe base lines thus started at right angles to each other, one can\r\nmeasure off with the measuring wire as large an area as he desires by\r\ntaking care to have the line each time drawn parallel with the last,\r\nand the stakes accurately placed at the marking points on the wire.\r\n\r\nStill another method which may be put to good use in laying out a\r\nvineyard, especially if the vineyard is small, is to combine measure\r\nand sight. The distances about the vineyard are measured and stakes\r\nset to mark the ends of the rows around the area. Good stakes can be\r\nmade from laths pointed at one end and whitewashed at the other. A\r\nline of stakes is then set across the field each way through the\r\ncenter, in places, of course, which the two central rows of vines will\r\nfill. When these are in place, if the area is not too large or too\r\nhilly, all measurements can be dispensed with and the vines can be set\r\nby sighting. A man at the end of the row has three laths to sight by\r\nin each row and a second man should drive stakes as directed by the\r\nsighter. Accurate work can be done by this method, but it requires\r\ntime, a good eye and much patience in the man who is sighting.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTING AND PREPARING THE VINES\r\n\r\nYoung grape vines covet life, for they are usually vigorous and not\r\neasily injured. Hence, the plants may be brought from a distance\r\nwithout fear of loss. The local nurseryman is, however, a good adviser\r\nas to varieties if he is honest and intelligent, and, other things\r\nequal, he should be patronized. But if the grower's needs cannot be\r\nmet at home, he should not hesitate to seek a nurseryman at a\r\ndistance. This is more necessary with the grape than other fruits\r\nbecause young grapes are well and cheaply grown in certain localities\r\nonly. With the grape, as with all fruit plants, it is much better to\r\nbuy from the grower than from tree peddlers.\r\n\r\n_Selecting vines._\r\n\r\nUnless the buyer knows what he wants, selecting vines is gambling pure\r\nand simple. Fortunately, there are several marks of good vines very\r\nhelpful to those who know them. One should first make sure that the\r\nroots and tops are alive to the remotest parts. The vines should have\r\na good clean, healthy look with trunk diameter large enough to\r\nindicate vigorous growth, and an ample spread of roots. Large size is\r\nnot as desirable as firm, well-matured wood and an abundance of roots.\r\nVines with internodes of medium length for the variety are better than\r\nthose with great length or very short internodes. Such precautions as\r\nare possible should be taken to insure varieties true to name,\r\nalthough here the reputation of the nurseryman must be depended on\r\nexcept for the few varieties which may be known at sight in the\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\nFirst-grade one-year-old vines are usually better than two-year-olds.\r\nStunted vines are not worth planting and two-year-old vines are often\r\nstunted one-year-olds. A few weak-growing varieties gain in vigor if\r\nallowed to remain in the nursery two years--three years, never.\r\n\r\n_Handling and preparing the vines._\r\n\r\nThe better vines are packed, transported and cared for in the field,\r\nthe quicker will the roots take hold and the vines make the vigorous\r\nstart on which so much depends. The nurseryman should be requested not\r\nto prune much before packing and to pack the vines well for shipping.\r\nThe vines should be heeled-in as soon as they reach their destination.\r\nIf the vines are dry on arrival, they should be drenched well before\r\nheeling-in. It sometimes happens that the vines are shriveled and\r\nshrunken from excessive drying, in which case the plants often may be\r\nbrought back to plumpness by burying them root and branch in damp\r\nearth, to remain a week or possibly two. To heel-in, a trench should\r\nbe double furrowed in light, moist soil, the vines spread out in the\r\ntrench two or three deep, and then earth shoveled over the roots and\r\nhalf the tops, sifting it in the roots, after which the soil is\r\nfirmed. The vines may thus be kept in good condition for several weeks\r\nif need arises.\r\n\r\nThe vines are prepared for planting by cutting away all dead or\r\ninjured roots and shortening-in the healthy roots. Grape roots can be\r\ncut severely if healthy stubs remain, the removal of small roots and\r\nfibers doing no harm, since fibers are of value only as indicating\r\nthat the vine is strong and vigorous. Fresh fibers come quickly from\r\nstout, healthy roots. Most of the fibers of a transplanted vine die,\r\nand laying them out in the hole to preserve them, as is so often\r\nrecommended, is but a useless burial rite. On good healthy vines, the\r\nstubs of the roots, when cut back, will be four to eight inches in\r\nlength. The root system having been considerably pruned, the\r\nreciprocity between roots and tops must be taken into account and the\r\ntop pruned accordingly. To reduce the work of the leaves to harmonize\r\nwith the activities of the roots, the top should be pruned to a single\r\ncane and two, never more than three, buds. The vine is now ready for\r\nplanting and, the soil being in readiness, planting should proceed\r\napace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI.--Black Hamburg (×1/2).]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING\r\n\r\nThe dangers and difficulties of planting hardwooded plants are greatly\r\nexaggerated. The tyro, in particular, is impressed with his\r\nresponsibilities at this time, and often sends a hurry-up call to\r\nexperiment station or nurseryman to \"send him a man to plant.\" If the\r\nland is properly prepared and the plants in good condition, the\r\noperation of planting is easily, quickly and safely accomplished.\r\nThere is no need, in planting the vine, of such puttering overniceties\r\nas laying out the roots to preserve the fibers, watering each vine as\r\nit is set, inserting the vine in a gingerly fashion to make sure that\r\nit stands in its new abode as it stood in the old, or puddling the\r\nroots in pail or tub of water. On the other hand, the slap-dash method\r\nof a Stringfellow who cuts off all small roots and uses a crowbar in\r\nplace of a spade is not doing duty by the plant, and burying the roots\r\ndeep in the earth or covering them close to the surface is courting\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n_Digging the holes._\r\n\r\nThis is a simple task in land in good tilth. The holes need only be\r\nlarge and deep enough to hold the roots without undue cramping. Herein\r\nis again manifested the wisdom of thoroughly preparing the land; for,\r\nin well-prepared land, the hole is really as large as the vineyard.\r\nEven in the condition of poor tilth, deep holes are often a menace to\r\nthe life of the plant, especially if drainage is not provided, for the\r\ndeep hole becomes a tub into which water pours and stands to soak the\r\nroots of dying vines. An extra spurt in digging holes cannot take the\r\nplace of perfect fitting of the land.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to commend the practice of digging holes in a leisure\r\ntime that all may be ready when the time to plant arrives. The vines\r\nwill strike root best in the freshly turned, moist soil of newly dug\r\nearth, which can be firmly set about the roots when the vine is\r\nplanted. Neither is time saved in digging beforehand, for the\r\nsun-baked and rain-washed sides of holes long dug would surely have to\r\nbe pared afresh. It is, however, quite worth while to throw the\r\nsurface soil to one side and that lower to the other, that a spadeful\r\nof moist, virile, surface soil may be put next to the roots.\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, some soils in which the holes might be blasted\r\nout with dynamite, as, for instance, in a shallow soil with the\r\nhardpan near the surface and good subsoil beneath. It is very\r\nquestionable, however, whether these defective soils should be used\r\nfor commercial plantings as long as there still remain unplanted many\r\nacres in all grape regions of good deep land for the grape. To such as\r\nare attracted by \"dynamite farming,\" minute descriptions of methods of\r\nuse of dynamite and even demonstrations may be secured from\r\nmanufacturers of the explosive.\r\n\r\n_Time to plant._\r\n\r\nThe best time to plant the vine in cold climates is early spring, when\r\nsun and showers arouse the spirit of growth in plants, and nutritive\r\nsolutions proceed quickly and unerringly to their preappointed places.\r\nAt this time, the much mutilated vine can undertake best the double\r\ntask of making fresh roots and opening the dormant leaves. Fall\r\nplanting puts forward the work, thus diminishing the rush of early\r\nspring when vineyard operations crowd, and, no doubt, when all is\r\nfavorable, enables the vines to start a little more quickly. However,\r\nthere are frequently serious losses from planting in the fall. In cold\r\nwinters the grip of frost is sufficient to wrench the young vine from\r\nits place and sometimes all but heaves it out of the soil. There is,\r\nalso, great liability of winter-killing in vines transplanted in the\r\nautumn, not because of greater tenderness of the plant, but because of\r\ngreater porosity of the loosened soil which enables the cold to strike\r\nto a greater depth. These two objections to fall planting can be\r\novercome largely by mounding up the earth so as practically to cover\r\nthe vines, leveling the mound in early spring; but this extra work\r\nmore than offsets the labor saving in fall planting.\r\n\r\nIn climates in which the soil does not freeze in the winter, the vines\r\nmay be set in the autumn if all is favorable. Often, however,\r\nconditions are not favorable to fall planting in warm climates, since\r\nautumn rains frequently soak the soil so that it cannot be placed\r\nproperly about the roots; and, moreover, in a cold, water-logged soil\r\nthe inactive roots begin to decay; or the soil may be too dry for fall\r\nplanting. Under such conditions, it is often better to delay planting\r\nin warm climates until spring when better soil conditions can be\r\nsecured. Fall or spring, the soil should be reasonably dry, warm and\r\nmellow when the work is done. The best time to plant must necessarily\r\nvary from year to year, and the vineyardist must decide exactly when\r\nto undertake planting in accordance with the conditions of soil and\r\nweather, mindful that the Psalmist's injunction that there is \"a time\r\nto plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted\" is subject to\r\nseveral conditions requiring judgment. The grape puts out its leaves\r\nlate in the spring, making the temptation great to delay planting;\r\nlate-set plants, however, need special care lest they suffer from the\r\nsummer droughts which annually parch the lands of this continent.\r\n\r\n_The operation of planting._\r\n\r\nAll being in readiness, planting proceeds rapidly. A gang of four men\r\nwork to advantage. Two dig holes, a third holds the vines and tramps\r\nthe earth as the remaining man shovels in earth. Except in large\r\nvineyards, four men are seldom available, and gangs of two or three\r\nmust divide the work among its members as best suits conditions. A\r\ntree-setting board is not needed in planting grapes, although some\r\ngrowers use it. The man who holds the vines in the hole and tramps as\r\nthe shoveler fills, must align the plant after the stake is removed\r\nand see that it stands perpendicularly in the hole. The stake, a lath,\r\nis set in its old place in the hole to serve as a support for the\r\ngrowing vine and to mark it so that the cultivator does not pull up\r\nthe young plant. The soil must be set firm about the roots of the\r\nplant, but zeal in tramping should diminish as the hole is filled,\r\nleaving the topsoil untramped, smooth, loose and pulverized, a dust\r\nmulch--the best of all mulches--to prevent evaporation.\r\n\r\nThe depth to which vines should be set is a matter of controversy.\r\nThis should be governed by the soil more than by any other factor,\r\nalthough some varieties need a deeper root-run than others. The rule\r\nto plant to the depth the vine stood in the nursery row is safe under\r\nmost conditions, although in light, hungry or thirsty soils the roots\r\nshould go deeper; and, on the other hand, in heavy soils, not so deep.\r\nDeep planting is a more common mistake than shallow planting, for\r\nroots under most conditions stand exposure better than internment,\r\ngoing down being more natural than coming up for a root seeking a\r\nplace to its liking.\r\n\r\nWatering at planting is necessary only when the land is parched with\r\ndrought or in regions in which irrigation is practiced. When\r\nnecessary, water should be used liberally, at least a gallon or two to\r\na vine. After the earth has been firmed about the roots and the hole\r\nis nearly filled, the water should be poured in and the hole filled\r\nwithout more firming. Under dry weather conditions, some prefer to\r\npuddle the roots; that is, to dip them in thin mud and plant with the\r\nmud adhering. In making the puddle, loose loam and not sticky clay is\r\nused, as clay may bake so hard as to injure the roots. With puddling,\r\nas with watering, the surface soil should be left loose and soft\r\nwithout traces of the puddling below.\r\n\r\nManure or fertilizer about the roots or even in the hole are not\r\nnecessary or even desirable. If the soil is to be enriched at all at\r\nplanting time, the fertilizer should be spread on the surface to be\r\ncultivated in or to have its food elements leak down as rains fall. In\r\nland in which the providential design for grapes is plainly\r\nmanifested, the vine at no time responds heartily to fertilizers, the\r\ngood of stable manure probably coming for the most part from its\r\neffects on the texture and water-holding capacity of the soil. The\r\nnewly set plant is not in need of outside nourishment; to put rank\r\nmanure or strong commercial fertilizers about the roots of a young\r\nnewly set vine is plant infanticide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF YOUNG VINES\r\n\r\nVirgil calls the period in the life of the vine between the setting\r\nand the first vintage, the \"tender nonage,\" and tells us that at this\r\ntime the vines need careful rearing; so they do, now as then, American\r\ngrapes as well as the grapes of ancient Rome. Fortunately, any\r\ndeparture from normal well-being is easily told in the grape, for the\r\ncolor of the leaf is as accurate an index to the health and vigor of\r\nthe vine as the color of the tongue or the beat of the pulse in man. A\r\nchange of color from the luxuriant green of thrifty grape foliage,\r\nespecially the yellow hue indicating that the leaf-green is not\r\nfunctioning properly, suggests that the vines are sick or need nursing\r\nin some detail of care. When all goes well, however, the amazing\r\nenergy of Nature is nowhere better seen among plants than in the\r\ngrowth of the grape, so that much of the care is in the use of the\r\nknife; in fact, as we shall see, the grape almost lives by the knife\r\nthe first two years out.\r\n\r\n_The first year._\r\n\r\nThe vines having been pruned and staked at planting, these operations\r\nneed no attention in the first summer. Many varieties send up several\r\nshoots as growth starts, and, except in the case of grafted plants\r\nand in the event of the suckers coming from the stock, these should be\r\nleft to feed the vine and help to establish a good root system. Vines\r\nmaking a strong growth should be tied to the stake, at least the\r\nstrongest shoot, to keep the wind from whipping it about and to keep\r\nthe plants out of the way of the cultivator. The only knack in tying\r\nis to keep the vine on the windward side of the stake, thus saving the\r\nbreaking of tying material.\r\n\r\nThe first year's pruning, though severe, is easily done. All but the\r\nstrongest cane are cut out and this is pruned back to two buds, nearly\r\nto the ground, so that the vines are much as when set in the vineyard.\r\nThis pruning, and that of the next two years, has as the object the\r\nestablishment of a good root system and the production of a sturdy\r\ntrunk at the height at which the vine is to be headed. It is important\r\nthat the cane from which the trunk is to come be healthy and the wood\r\nwell ripened. Pruning may be done at any time after the leaves fall,\r\nthough most growers give preference to late winter. In cold climates\r\nit is a good practice to plow up to the young vines for winter\r\nprotection, in which case the pruning should be done before plowing.\r\n\r\nEvery detail of vineyard management should be performed with care and\r\nat the accepted time in this critical first year. Cultivation must be\r\nintensive, insects and fungi must be warded off, mechanical injuries\r\navoided, vines that have refused to grow must be marked for discard,\r\nand the vineyard be put down to a cover-crop in early August if it was\r\nnot earlier planted to some hoed catch-crop.\r\n\r\n_The second year._\r\n\r\nWork begins in the spring of the second year with the setting of\r\ntrellis posts on which one wire is put up. The vine is not yet ready\r\nto train but the slender lath of the first season is not sufficient\r\nsupport, and the one wire on the future trellis saves the expense of\r\nstaking. Tying requires some care and is usually done with string or\r\nbast. As the summer proceeds, suckers from the roots are removed and\r\nsome growers thin the shoots on the young vine; some think it\r\nnecessary also to top the growth if it becomes too luxuriant and so\r\nkeep the cane within bounds. Suckers must be cut or broken off at the\r\npoints where they originate, otherwise several new ones may start from\r\nthe base of the old. If the vines are topped, it must be kept in mind\r\nthat summer pruning is weakening, and the tips of shoots should,\r\ntherefore, be taken when small, the object being to direct the growth\r\ninto those parts of the vine which are to become permanent.\r\n\r\nPruning, the second winter the vine is out, depends on the vigor of\r\nthe plant. If a strong, healthy, well-matured cane over-tops the lower\r\nwire of the trellis, it should be cut back so that the cane may be\r\ntied to the wire; otherwise the vine should again be cut almost to the\r\nground, leaving but three or four buds. If the cane be left, in\r\naddition to sturdiness and maturity, it should be straight, for it is\r\nto become the trunk of the mature vine. The training of the young vine\r\nis now at an end, for the next season the vine must be started toward\r\nits permanent form, instructions for which are given in the chapter on\r\npruning.\r\n\r\nThe summer care of the vineyard does not differ materially in the\r\nsecond year from that of the first. Intensive cultivation continues,\r\nthe vines are treated for pests and the annual cover-crop follows\r\ncultivation. Many varieties, if vigorous, will set some fruit in this\r\nsecond summer, but the crop should not be allowed to mature, the\r\nsooner removed the better, as fruiting at this stage of growth\r\nseriously weakens the young vines.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATCH-CROPS AND COVER-CROPS\r\n\r\nA catch-crop is one grown between the rows of another crop for profit\r\nfrom the produce. A cover-crop is a temporary crop grown, as the term\r\nwas first used, to protect the soil, but the word is now used to\r\ninclude green-manuring crops as well. Catch-crops seldom have a place\r\nin most vineyards, but cover-crops are often grown.\r\n\r\n_Catch-crops._\r\n\r\nCatch-crops are not, as a rule, profitable in commercial vineyards;\r\nthey may bring temporary profit but in the long run they are usually\r\ndetrimental to the vines. It may pay and the grape may not be injured\r\nin some localities, if such truck crops as potatoes, beans, tomatoes\r\nand cabbage are grown between the rows or even in the rows for the\r\nfirst year and possibly the second. Land, to do duty by the two crops,\r\nhowever, must be excellent and the care of both crops must be of the\r\nbest. Growing gooseberries, currants, any of the brambles, or even\r\nstrawberries, is a poor procedure unless the vineyard is small, the\r\nland very valuable or other conditions prevail which make intensive\r\nculture possible or necessary. The objections to catch-crops in the\r\nvineyard are two: they rob the vines of food and moisture and endanger\r\nthem to injury from tools in caring for the catch-crop.\r\n\r\nSometimes the grape itself is planted as a catch-crop in the vineyard.\r\nThat is, twice the number of vines required in a row for the permanent\r\nvineyard are set with the expectation of cutting out alternate vines\r\nwhen two or three crops have been harvested and the vines begin to\r\ncrowd. This practice is preferable to inter-planting with bush-fruits,\r\nyet there is not much to commend it if the experience of those who\r\nhave tried it is taken as a guide. Too often the filler vines are left\r\na year too long with the result that the permanent vines are checked\r\nin growth for several years following. The profits from the fillers\r\nare never large, scarcely pay for the extra work, and if the permanent\r\nvines are stunted, the filler must be put down as a liability rather\r\nthan as an asset.\r\n\r\n_Cover-crops._\r\n\r\nIn an experiment being conducted by the New York Agricultural\r\nExperiment Station, grapes do not give a very appreciable response to\r\ncover-crops in yield of fruit or growth of vine.[9] There seem to be\r\nno other experiments to confirm the results at the New York Station,\r\nand grape-growers nowhere have used cover-crops very generally for the\r\nbetterment of their vineyards. There is doubt, therefore, as to\r\nwhether grapes will respond profitably to the annual use of\r\ncover-crops in yield of fruit, which, of course, is the ultimate test\r\nof the value of cover-crops, but a test hard to apply unless the\r\nexperiment runs a great number of years.\r\n\r\nLeaving out the doubtful value of cover-crops in increasing the supply\r\nof plant-food and thereby producing an increase in yield, there are at\r\nleast three ways in which cover-crops are valuable in the vineyard.\r\nThus, it is patent to all who have tried cover-crops in the vineyard\r\nthat the land is in much better tilth and more easily worked when some\r\ngreen crop is turned under in fall or spring; it is not unreasonable\r\nto assume, though it is impossible to secure reliable experimental\r\ndata to confirm the belief, that cover-crops protect the roots of\r\ngrapes from winter-killing; certainly it may be expected that a\r\ncover-crop sowed in midsummer will cause grapes to mature their wood\r\nearlier and more thoroughly so that the vines go into the winter in\r\nbetter condition. The only objection to be raised against cover-crops\r\nin the vineyard is that pickers, mostly women, object to the\r\ncover-crop when wet with rain or dew and usually choose to pick in\r\nvineyards having no such crop. This seemingly insignificant factor\r\noften gives the grape-grower who sows cover-crops much trouble in\r\nharvest time.\r\n\r\nSeveral cover-crops may be planted in vineyards as clover, vetch,\r\noats, barley, cow-horn turnip, rape, rye and buckwheat. Combinations\r\nof these usually make the seed too costly or the trouble of sowing too\r\ngreat. Yet some combinations of a leguminous and non-leguminous crop\r\nwould seem to make the best green crop for the grape. Thus, a bushel\r\nof oats or barley plus ten pounds of clover or twenty pounds of winter\r\nvetch, a combination often used in orchards, should prove satisfactory\r\nin the vineyard. Or, doubling the amount of seed for each, these crops\r\ncould be alternated, with a change in the rotation every four or six\r\nyears, with cow-horn turnip or rape. Turnip and rape require at least\r\nthree pounds of seed to the acre.\r\n\r\nThe cover-crop is sown in midsummer, about the first of August in\r\nnorthern latitudes, and should be plowed under in the fall or early\r\nspring. Under no circumstances should the green crop be permitted to\r\nstand in the vineyard late in the spring to rob the vines of food and\r\nmoisture. The weather map must be watched at sowing time to make sure\r\nof a moist seed-bed. Plate III illustrates two vineyards with\r\nwell-grown cover-crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nTILLAGE\r\n\r\nGrape-growers are not in the fog that befuddles growers of tree-fruits\r\nin regard to tillage. He is a sloven, indeed, who permits his vines to\r\nstand a season in unbroken ground, and there are no growers who\r\nrecommend sod or any of the modified sod-mulches for the grape.\r\nTillage is difficult in hilly regions and the operation is often\r\nneglected in hillside vineyards, as in the Central Lakes region of New\r\nYork, but even here some sort of tillage is universal. The skip of a\r\nsingle season in tilling stunts the vines, and two or three skips in\r\nsuccessive seasons ruin a vineyard. No one complains that grapes\r\nsuffer from over-tilling as one frequently hears of tree-fruits. There\r\nis no tonic for the grape that compares with cultivation when the\r\nleaves lack color and hang limp and the vine has an indefinable air of\r\ndepression; and there is nothing better than cultivation to rouse\r\nlatent vigor in a scorching summer, or when drought lays heavy on the\r\nland.\r\n\r\n_Tillage tools._\r\n\r\nThe tools to be used in tilling grapes vary with the topography of the\r\nvineyard, the kind of soil and the preferences of the vineyardist. The\r\nbest tool is the one with which the ground can be well fitted at least\r\nexpense. Good work in the vineyard requires at least two plows, a\r\nsingle-horse and a two-horse plow. The latter, except on very hilly\r\nland, should be a gang-plow. For commercial vineyards of any\r\nconsiderable size, several cultivators are necessary for different\r\nseasons and conditions of the soil. Thus, every vineyard should have a\r\nspring-tooth and a disc harrow, one of the several types of weeders, a\r\none-horse and a sulky cultivator. If weeds abound, it is necessary to\r\nhave some cutting tool, or an attachment to one of the cultivators, to\r\nslide over the ground and cut off large weeds. Another indispensable\r\ntool in a large vineyard is a one-horse grape-hoe, to supplement the\r\nwork of which there must be heavy hand-hoes. Very often the surface\r\nsoil must be pulverized, and a clod-crusher, roller or a float becomes\r\na necessity. A full complement of bright, sharp tools at the command\r\nof the grape-grower goes far toward success in his business.\r\n\r\n_Tillage methods._\r\n\r\nThere are several reliable guides indicating when the vineyard needs\r\nto be tilled. The vineyardist who is but a casual observer of the\r\nrelation of vineyard operations to the life events and the welfare of\r\nhis vines will take the crop of weeds as his guide. It is, of course,\r\nnecessary to keep down the weeds, but the man who waits until weeds\r\nforce him to till will make a poor showing in his vineyard. The\r\namount of moisture in the soil is a better guide. The chief function\r\nof tillage is to save moisture by checking evaporation and to put the\r\nsoil in such condition that its water-holding capacity is increased.\r\nThe physical condition of the land is another guide. Tilling when the\r\nsoil needs pulverizing furnishes a greater feeding surface for the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nTillage begins with plowing in early spring. Whether provided with a\r\ncover-crop to be turned under or hard and bare, the land must be\r\nbroken each spring with the plow. Plowing is best done by running a\r\nsingle furrow with a one-horse plow up to or away from the vines as\r\noccasion calls and then following with a two-horse or a gang-plow.\r\nSome growers use a disc harrow instead of the plow to break the land\r\nin the spring, but this is a doubtful procedure in most vineyards and\r\nis impossible when a heavy green-crop covers the land. Tillage with\r\nharrow, cultivator, weeder or roller then proceeds at such intervals\r\nas conditions demand, seldom less than once a fortnight, until time to\r\nsow the cover-crop in midsummer. About the time grapes blossom, the\r\ngrape-hoe should be used to level down the furrow turned up to the\r\nvines in the spring plowing. Tillage should always follow a heavy rain\r\nto prevent the formation of a soil crust, this being a time when he\r\nwho tills quickly tills twice. The number of times a vineyard should\r\nbe tilled depends on the soil and the season. Ten times over with the\r\ncultivator in one vineyard or season may not be as effective as _five_\r\ntimes in another vineyard or another season. In some regions, as in\r\nNew York, the grower is so often at the mercy of wet weather in early\r\nspring that the plowing is best done in the fall, and spring\r\noperations must then open with harrowing with some tool that will\r\nbreak the land thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe depth to till is governed by the nature of the soil and the\r\nseason. Heavy soils need deep tilling; light soils, shallow tilling;\r\nin wet weather, till deeply; in dry weather, lightly. Grape roots are\r\nwell down in the soil and there is little danger of injuring them in\r\ndeep tillage. The depth of plowing and cultivating should be varied\r\nsomewhat from season to season to avoid the formation of a plow-sole.\r\nIn some regions plowing and cultivating may be made a means of\r\ncombating insects and fungi, and this regulates the depth of tillage.\r\nThus, in the Chautauqua grape-belt of western New York, the pupa of\r\nthe root-worm, a scourge of the grape in this region, is thrown out\r\nand destroyed by the grape-hoe just as it is about ready to emerge as\r\nan adult to lay its eggs on the vines. In all regions, leaves and\r\nmummied grapes bearing countless myriads of spores of the mildews,\r\nblack-rot and other fungi are interned by the plow and cannot scatter\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe time in the season to stop tillage depends on the locality, the\r\nseason and the variety. It is a good rule to cease cultivation a few\r\nweeks before the grapes attain full size and begin to color, for by\r\nthis time they will have weighted down the vines so that fruit and\r\nfoliage will be in the way of the cultivator. In the North,\r\ncultivation ceases in the ordinary season about the first of August,\r\nearlier the farther south. Rank-growing sorts, as Concord or Clinton,\r\ndo not need to be cultivated as late as those of smaller growth and\r\nscantier foliage, as Delaware or Diamond. The cover-crop seed is\r\ncovered the last time over with the cultivator. Plate IV shows a\r\nwell-tilled vineyard of Concords.\r\n\r\n\r\nIRRIGATION\r\n\r\nThe grape, as a rule, withstands drought very well, several species\r\ngrowing wild on the desert's edge. Even in the semi-arid regions of\r\nthe far West, where other fruits must always be irrigated, the grape\r\noften grows well without artificial watering. Irrigation is practiced\r\nin vineyards in the United States only on the Pacific slope and here\r\nthe practice is not as general as with other fruit crops. Whether the\r\ngrape shall be grown under irrigation or not is a local and often an\r\nindividual question answered with regard to several conditions; as the\r\nlocal rainfall, the depth and character of the soil, the cost of water\r\nand ease of irrigation. These conditions are all correlated and make\r\nabout the most complex and difficult problem the growers of grapes in\r\nsemi-arid regions have to solve. As long, however, as the grape-grower\r\ncan grow fairly vigorous vines and harvest a fairly bountiful crop by\r\nnatural rainfall, he should not irrigate; for, even though the crop\r\noffsets the cost, there are several objections to growing grapes under\r\nirrigation. The vines are subject to more diseases and physiological\r\ntroubles; the fruit is said to lack aroma and flavor; grapes grown on\r\nirrigated land do not stand shipment well, the unduly inflated grapes\r\noften bursting; wine-makers do not like irrigated grapes as well as\r\nthose from non-irrigated lands; and watery grapes from irrigated lands\r\nmake inferior raisins. It is maintained, however, with a show of\r\nreason, that grapes suffer in irrigated vineyards in the ways set\r\nforth only when the vines are over-or improperly irrigated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VII.--Barry (×2/5). Delaware (×2/5).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFERTILIZERS FOR GRAPES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs regards fertilizers, the grape-grower has much to learn and in\r\nlearning he must approach the problem with humility of mind. For in\r\nhis experimenting, which is the best way to learn, he will no sooner\r\narrive at what seems to be a certain conclusion, than another season's\r\nresults or the yields in an adjoining vineyard will upset the findings\r\nof past seasons and those obtained in other places. Unfortunately,\r\nthere is little real knowledge to be obtained on the subject, for\r\ngrape-growers have not yet broken away from time-worn dictums in\r\nregard to fertilizers and still follow recommendations drawn from work\r\nwith truck and field crops. This is excused by the fact that there\r\nhave been almost no comprehensive experiments in the country with\r\nfertilizers for grapes.\r\n\r\nNo fallacies die harder than the pronouncements of chemists a\r\ngeneration ago that fertilizing consists in putting in the soil\r\napproximately that which the plants take out; and that the chemical\r\ncomposition of the crop affords the necessary guide to fertilizing.\r\nThese two theories are the basis of nearly every recommendation that\r\ncan be found for the use of fertilizers in growing crops. The facts\r\napplied to the grape, however, are that the average tillable soil\r\ncontains a hundred or a thousand times more of the chemical\r\nconstituents of plants than the grape can possibly take from the soil;\r\nand many experiments in supplying food to plants show that the\r\nchemical composition of the plant is not a safe guide to their\r\nfertilizer requirements. Later teachings in regard to the use of\r\nfertilizers are: That the quantity of mineral food in a soil may be of\r\nfar less importance than the quantity of water, and that the\r\ncultivator should make certain that there is sufficient moisture in\r\nhis land so that the mineral salts may be readily dissolved and so\r\nbecome available as plant-food; that far too much importance has been\r\nattached to putting chemicals in the soil and too little to the\r\nphysical condition of the soil, whereby the work of bacteria and the\r\nsolvent action of organic acids may make available plant-food that\r\nwithout these agencies is unavailable.\r\n\r\nThese brief and simple statements introduce to grape-growers some of\r\nthe problems with which they must deal in fertilizing grapes, and show\r\nwhat a complex problem of chemistry, physics and biology fertilizing\r\nthe soil is; how difficult experimental work in this field is; and how\r\ncautious workers must be in interpreting results of either experiment\r\nor experience. An account of an experiment in fertilizing a vineyard\r\nmay make even more plain the difficulties in carrying on experiments\r\nin fertilizing fruits and the caution that must be observed in drawing\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EXPERIMENT IN FERTILIZING GRAPES\r\n\r\nThe New York Agricultural Experiment Station is experimenting with\r\nfertilizers for grapes at Fredonia, Chautauqua County, the chief grape\r\nregion in eastern America. The experiment should be of interest to\r\nevery grape-grower from several points of view. It not only shows that\r\nthere are many and difficult problems in fertilizing grapes, but also\r\nthe results of the use of manure, commercial fertilizers and\r\ncover-crops in a particular vineyard; it suggests the fertilizers to\r\nbe used and the methods of use; and it furnishes a plan for an\r\nexperiment by grape-growers who want to try such an experiment and\r\ndraw their own conclusions. An account of the experiment and the\r\nresults for the first five years follows:[10]\r\n\r\n_Tests at Fredonia._\r\n\r\n\"In the vineyard at Fredonia eleven plats were laid out in a section\r\nof the vineyard where inequalities of soil and other conditions were\r\nslight or were neutralized. Each plat included three rows (about\r\none-sixth of an acre) and was separated from the adjoining plats by a\r\n'buffer' row not under test. One plat in the center of the section\r\nserved as a check, and five different fertilizer combinations were\r\nused on duplicate plats at either side of the check. Plats 1 and 7\r\nreceived lime and a complete fertilizer with quick-acting and\r\nslow-acting nitrogen; Plats 2 and 8 received the complete fertilizer\r\nbut no lime; on Plats 3 and 9 potash was omitted from the complete\r\nfertilizer combination; Plats 4 and 10 received no phosphorus; Plats 5\r\nand 11, no nitrogen; and Plat 6 was the check. The materials were\r\napplied at such rates that they provided for the first year 72 pounds\r\nof nitrogen per acre, 25 pounds of phosphorus and 59 pounds of\r\npotassium; and for each of the last four years two-thirds as much\r\nnitrogen and phosphorus and eight-ninths as much potassium. The lime\r\nwas applied the first and fourth years in quantity to make a ton to\r\nthe acre annually. Cover-crops were sown on all plats alike and were\r\nplowed under in late April or early May of each year. These differed\r\nin successive years, but included no legumes. The crops used were rye,\r\nwheat, barley and cow-horn turnips separately and the last two in\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\n\"The cultivation differed only in thoroughness from that generally\r\nused in the Belt, the aim being to maintain a good dust mulch during\r\nthe whole growing season. Pruning by the Chautauqua System was done\r\nthroughout by one man, who pruned solely according to the vigor of the\r\nindividual vines and left four, two or three, or no fruiting canes as\r\nappeared best. The vineyard was thoroughly sprayed, all plats alike.\r\n\r\n\"Low winter temperatures, affecting immature wood and buds caused by\r\nunfavorable weather of the previous season, reduced yields materially\r\nduring two of the five years, and practically neutralized any\r\nanticipated benefit from fertilizers. Following the first of these\r\nlow-crop years, came a season, 1911, in which favorable conditions,\r\nacting upon vines left undiminished in vigor by the light crop of the\r\nprevious year resulted in heavy and quite uniform yields on all the\r\nplats.\r\n\r\n\"The yields for the five years are shown in Table I; and a summary\r\nshowing the average gains from each treatment is given in Table II,\r\nwith the average financial balance after deducting the cost of\r\nfertilizer application from the increased returns from the plats\r\nreceiving them.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.--YIELD OF GRAPES (TONS PER ACRE) IN FERTILIZER EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n  Plat.|                         |      |      |      |      |      |5-year\r\n  No.  |                         | 1909 | 1910 | 1911 | 1912 | 1913 |avg.\r\n  -----+-------------------------+------+------+------+------+------+------\r\n       |                         |_Tons_|_Tons_|_Tons_|_Tons_|_Tons_|_Tons_\r\n     1 |Complete fertilizer; lime| 4.48 | 2.10 | 5.37 | 3.46 | 2.14 | 3.51\r\n     2 |Complete fertilizer      | 4.76 | 2.21 | 5.71 | 4.30 | 2.83 | 3.96\r\n     3 |Nitrogen and phosphorus  | 5.17 | 2.14 | 5.61 | 4.00 | 2.25 | 3.83\r\n     4 |Nitrogen and potash      | 4.25 | 2.55 | 5.64 | 4.10 | 2.85 | 3.87\r\n     5 |Phosphorus and potash    | 3.41 | 2.00 | 5.44 | 4.35 | 1.78 | 3.39\r\n     6 |Check                    | 3.38 | 2.10 | 5.32 | 3.60 | 1.24 | 3.12\r\n     7 |Complete fertilizer; lime| 4.69 | 2.38 | 5.62 | 4.80 | 3.04 | 4.10\r\n     8 |Complete fertilizer      | 4.66 | 2.07 | 5.71 | 4.98 | 2.72 | 4.02\r\n     9 |Nitrogen and phosphorus  | 4.99 | 2.04 | 5.35 | 4.89 | 2.61 | 3.97\r\n    10 |Nitrogen and potash      | 4.79 | 2.26 | 5.91 | 4.89 | 3.07 | 4.18\r\n    11 |Phosphorus and potash    | 4.99 | 1.87 | 5.03 | 4.21 | 1.97 | 3.61\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n\r\nTABLE II.--AVERAGE INCREASE IN GRAPE YIELDS AND AVERAGE FINANCIAL GAIN\r\nFROM FERTILIZER APPLICATIONS\r\n\r\n    N = nitrogen, P = phosphorus, K = potassium, Ca = lime.\r\n    Gains in tons per acre.\r\n\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n                        | N, P,   | N, P,   | N, P.   | N, K.   | P, K.\r\n                        | K, Ca.  | K.      |         |         |\r\n  ----------------------+---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n                        |  _Tons_ |  _Tons_ |  _Tons_ |  _Tons_ |  _Tons_\r\n  First plat of pair    |    3.51 |    3.96 |    3.83 |    3.87 |   3.39\r\n  Second plat of pair   |    4.10 |    4.02 |    3.97 |    4.18 |   3.61\r\n                        |---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n      Average           |    3.80 |    3.97 |    3.90 |    4.02 |   3.50\r\n  Check plat            |    3.12 |    3.12 |    3.12 |    3.12 |   3.12\r\n                        |---------+---------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  Average gain          |     .68 |     .85 |     .78 |     .90 |    .38\r\n  Average financial gain|   $5.82 |  $13.84 |  $14.05 |  $18.54 |  $6.99\r\n  ========================================================================\r\n\r\nFrom this last table the benefit from nitrogen appears quite evident\r\nsince every combination in which it appears gives a substantial gain\r\nover the one from which it is absent. Phosphorus and potassium without\r\nthe nitrogen, lead to only a slight increase over the check; and lime\r\nappears to be of no benefit. Financially, the complete fertilizer and\r\nlime combination, the nitrogen and phosphorus combination and the\r\nphosphorus and potassium combination failed to pay their cost in five\r\nof the ten comparisons; the complete fertilizer was used at a loss\r\nfour times out of ten; and the nitrogen and potassium combination\r\nthree times out of ten. Lime had no appreciable effect on either vines\r\nor fruit.\r\n\r\n\"No effect of the fertilizers on the fruit itself, aside from yield,\r\nwas shown for the first three years; but in 1912, and even more\r\nmarkedly in 1913, the fruit from the plats on which nitrogen had been\r\nused was superior in compactness of cluster, size of cluster and size\r\nof berry. In 1912 also, when early ripening was a decided advantage,\r\nthe fruit on the nitrogen plats matured earlier than that on the\r\ncheck plats. In 1913 the favorable ripening season and the smaller\r\ncrop tended to equalize the time of ripening on all plats. The grapes\r\non the phosphorus-potassium plats were better in quality than those in\r\nthe check plats but not as good as those on the plats where nitrogen\r\nwas used.\r\n\r\n\"Other indexes also show plainly the benefit from nitrogen in this\r\nvineyard; for size and weight of leaf, weight of wood produced and\r\nnumber of fruiting canes left on the vines were all greater where\r\nfertilizers, and particularly nitrogen, had been used. The three-year\r\naverages (1911-1913) of the measurements for these characteristics are\r\nshown in Table III:\r\n\r\nTABLE III.--COMPARATIVE PRODUCTION OF LEAVES, WOOD AND FRUITING CANES\r\nON GRAPE VINES DIFFERENTLY FERTILIZED\r\n\r\n  (Averages for three years.)\r\n\r\n  =======================================================================\r\n     FERTILIZER APPLICATION   | LEAF       | WOOD       | FRUITING\r\n                              | WEIGHT[11] | PRUNED[12] | CANES LEFT[13]\r\n  ----------------------------+------------+------------+----------------\r\n                              |  _Grams._  |   _Lbs._   |\r\n   Complete fertilizer; lime  |   1,033    |   1,295    |   2,468\r\n   Complete fertilizer        |   1,010    |   1,367    |   2,609\r\n   Nitrogen and phosphorus    |   1,047    |   1,272    |   2,585\r\n   Nitrogen and potassium     |   1,069    |   1,401    |   2,646\r\n   Phosphorus and potassium   |     964    |   1,086    |   2,326\r\n   Check                      |     930    |     915    |   2,110\r\n  =======================================================================\r\n\r\n_Coöperative experiments._\r\n\r\n\"In order to secure information as to the behavior of fertilizers on\r\nthe different soils of the Grape Belt, coöperative tests were carried\r\non in six vineyards owned, respectively, by S. S. Grandin, Westfield;\r\nHon. C. M. Hamilton, State Line; James Lee, Brocton; H. S. Miner,\r\nDunkirk; Miss Frances Jennings, Silver Creek; and J. T. Barnes,\r\nProspect Station. The soil in these vineyards included gravelly loam,\r\nshale loam and clay loam, all in the Dunkirk series, and the\r\nexperiments covered from two to two and a half acres in three cases\r\nand about five acres in each of the other vineyards. The work\r\ncontinued four years in all but one of the experiments, which it was\r\nnecessary to end after the second year.\r\n\r\n\"The general plan of the tests was much like that at Fredonia in most\r\nof the vineyards, with the additions of plats for stable manure and\r\nfor leguminous and non-leguminous cover crops with and without lime.\r\nFrom two to six check plats were left for comparison in each vineyard.\r\nAs already stated the results were often inconsistent in duplicate\r\nplats in the same vineyard, and if one test appeared to point\r\ndefinitely in a certain direction, the indication would be negatived\r\nby results in other vineyards. In these experiments the yield of fruit\r\nwas the only index to the effect of treatments as it was not possible\r\nto weigh leaves or pruned wood, or to count the canes left.\r\n\r\n\"Nitrogen and potassium in combination, which gave the largest gains\r\nand greatest profit in the Station vineyard at Fredonia, showed a 13\r\nper ct. increase in yield on one plat in the Jennings vineyard and a 9\r\nper ct. decrease on the other; in the Miner vineyard this combination\r\napparently resulted in a 25 per ct. increase; in the Lee vineyard in a\r\n2-1/2 per ct. loss; in the Hamilton vineyard a 17 per ct. gain; and in\r\nthe Grandin vineyard neither gain nor loss. In only two of the five\r\nvineyards in which this combination was tested was the gain great\r\nenough to pay the cost of the fertilizer applied. Similar\r\ndiscrepancies, or absence of profitable gain, mark the use of the\r\nother fertilizer combinations.\r\n\r\n\"Even stable manure, the standby of the farmer and fruit-grower, when\r\napplied at the rate of five tons per acre each spring, and plowed in,\r\ndid not, on the average, pay for itself. Indeed, there were few\r\ninstances among the 60 comparisons possible, in which more than a\r\nvery moderate profit could be credited to manure. The average increase\r\nin yield following the application of manure alone was less than a\r\nquarter of a ton of grapes to the acre; while the use of lime with the\r\nmanure increased the gain to one-third of a ton per acre. The ton of\r\nlime to the acre annually would not be paid for by the gain of 175\r\npounds of grapes. Cover-crops were used in five of the six coöperative\r\nexperiments and proved even less adapted to increasing crop yields\r\nthan did the manure. There was no appreciable gain, on the average,\r\nfrom the use of mammoth clover; indeed, a slight loss must be recorded\r\nfor the clover except upon the plats which were also limed, and even\r\nwith the lime the average yields on check plats and mammoth clover\r\nplats differed by only one one-hundredth of a ton. Wheat or barley\r\nwith cow-horn turnips made a slightly better showing, as the plats on\r\nwhich these crops were turned under, without lime, averaged about\r\none-twentieth of a ton to the acre better than the checks. With these\r\nnon-legumes, lime was apparently a detriment, as the plants with the\r\nlime yielded a tenth of a ton less, on the average, than those without\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n_Practical lessons from the Fredonia experiment._\r\n\r\nFrom this experiment it becomes clear that the use of fertilizers in a\r\nvineyard is a local problem. General advice is of little value. It is\r\nevident also that the fertilization of vineyards is so involved with\r\nother factors that only carefully planned and long continued work will\r\ngive reliable information as to the needs of vines. Indeed, field\r\nexperiments even in carefully selected vineyards, as the coöperative\r\nexperiments show, may be so contradictory and misleading as to be\r\nworse than useless, if deductions are made from the results of a few\r\nseasons. The experiment, however, has brought forth information about\r\nfertilizing vineyards that ought to be most helpful to grape-growers.\r\nThus, the results suggest:\r\n\r\n_Only vineyards in good condition respond to fertilizers._\r\n\r\nIt is usually waste to make applications of fertilizers in poorly\r\ndrained vineyards, in such as suffer from winter cold or spring\r\nfrosts, where insect pests are epidemic and uncontrolled or where good\r\ncare is lacking. The experiments furnish several examples of\r\ninertness, ineffectiveness or failure to produce profit when the\r\nfertilizers were applied under any of the conditions named. They\r\nemphasize the importance of paying attention to all of the factors on\r\nwhich plant growth is dependent. Moisture, soil temperature, aëration,\r\nthe texture of the soil, freedom from pests, cold and frosts, as well\r\nas the supply of food may limit the yield of grapes.\r\n\r\n_A vineyard soil may have a one-sided wear._\r\n\r\nIt is certain in some of the experiments and strongly indicated in\r\nothers that the soil is having a one-sided wear--that only one or a\r\nvery few of the elements of fertility are lacking. The element most\r\nfrequently lacking is nitrogen. Exception will probably be found in\r\nvery light sands or gravels which are often deficient in potash and\r\nthe phosphates; or on soils so shallow or of such mechanical texture\r\nthat the root range of the vine is limited; or in soils so wet or so\r\ndry as to limit the root range or prevent biological activities. These\r\nexceptions mean, as a rule, that the soils possessing the unfavorable\r\nqualities are unfitted for grape-growing. The grape-grower should try\r\nto discover which of the fertilizing elements his soil lacks and not\r\nwaste by using elements not needed.\r\n\r\n_Grape soils are often uneven._\r\n\r\nThe marked unevenness of the soil in the seven vineyards in which\r\nthese experiments were carried on, as indicated by the crops and the\r\neffects of the fertilizers, furnishes food for thought to\r\ngrape-growers. Maximum profits cannot be approached in vineyards in\r\nwhich the soil is as uneven as in these, which were in every case\r\nselected because there was an appearance of uniformity. A problem\r\nbefore grape-growers is to make uniform all conditions in their\r\nvineyards, and the vines must be kept free from pests if fertilizers\r\nare to be profitably used.\r\n\r\n_How a grape-grower may know when his vines need fertilizers._\r\n\r\nA grape-grower may assume that his vines do not need fertilizers if\r\nthey are vigorous and making a fair annual growth. When the vineyard\r\nis found to be failing in vigor, the first step to be taken is to make\r\nsure that the drainage is good; the second step, to control insect and\r\nfungous pests; the third, to give tillage and good care; and the\r\nfourth step is to apply fertilizers if they be found necessary. Few\r\nvineyards will be found to require a complete fertilizer. What the\r\nspecial requirements of a vineyard are can be ascertained only by\r\nexperiment and are probably not ascertainable by analyses of the soil.\r\nThis experiment furnishes suggestions as to how the grape-grower may\r\ntest the value of fertilizers in his own vineyard.\r\n\r\n_Applying fertilizers._\r\n\r\nWhen it is certain that vines need fertilization, and what is wanted\r\nis known, the fertilizers should be put on in the spring and be worked\r\nin by the spring cultivation. Stable manure should be plowed under.\r\nGrape roots forage throughout the whole top layer of soil so that the\r\nland should be covered with the fertilizer, whether chemical or\r\nbarnyard manure. Applications of commercial fertilizers are generally\r\nspread broadcast, though it is better to drill them in if the foliage\r\nis out on the vines and thus avoid possible injury to tender foliage.\r\nCommercial fertilizers should be mixed thoroughly and in a finely\r\ndivided state. In leachy soils, nitrate of soda ought not to be\r\napplied too early in the season, as it will quickly wash down out of\r\nreach of the grape roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII.--Brighton (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n_Over-rich soils._\r\n\r\nSome soils are too rich for the grape. On these the growth is\r\nover-luxuriant, the wood does not mature in the autumn, fruit-buds do\r\nnot form and the fruit is poor in quality. Certain varieties can stand\r\na richer soil than others. Over-richness is a trouble that may cure\r\nitself as the vines come in full bearing and make greater demands on\r\nthe soil for food. It is well, however, on a soil that is suspected of\r\nbeing too rich or so proved by the behavior of the vines, to provide\r\nan extra wire on the trellis, to prune little and thus take care of\r\nthe rampant growth. Some soils, however, and this is often the case,\r\nare so rich that the grape cannot be made to thrive in them; the vines\r\nwaste their substance in riotous living, producing luxuriant foliage\r\nand lusty wood but little or no fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPRUNING THE GRAPE IN EASTERN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe inexperienced look on pruning as a difficult operation in\r\ngrape-growing. But once a few fundamentals are grasped, grape-pruning\r\nis not difficult. There is much less perplexity in pruning the grape\r\nthan in pruning tree-fruits. Pruning follows accepted patterns in\r\nevery grape region, and when the pattern is learned the difficulties\r\nare easily overcome. The inexperienced are confused by the array of\r\n\"principles,\" \"types,\" \"methods,\" \"systems\" and the many technical\r\nterms that enter into discussions of grape-pruning. Some of the\r\ntechnicalities come from European practices, and others originated in\r\nthe infancy of grape-growing in this country when there was great\r\ndiversity in pruning. Divested of much that is but jargon, an\r\ninexperienced man can easily learn in a few lessons, from word of\r\nmouth or printed page, how to prune grapes.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of pruning has led to slighting the work in commercial\r\nvineyards, by too often trusting it to unskilled hands. Then, too, in\r\nthis age of power-propelled tools, pride in hand labor has been left\r\nbehind, and few grape-growers now take time and trouble to become\r\nexpert in pruning. Simple as the work may seem to those long\r\naccustomed to it, he who wants to put into his pruning painstaking\r\nintelligence and to taste the joy of a task well done finds in this\r\nvineyard operation an ample field for pleasure and for the development\r\nof greater profits. The price to be paid by those who would thus\r\nattempt perfection in pruning the vine is forward vision, the\r\nmechanic's eye, the gardener's touch, patience, and pride in\r\nhandicraft.\r\n\r\nSimple as pruning is, the pruner soon learns that it is an art in\r\nwhich perfection is better known in mind than followed in deed. The\r\ntheory is easy but there are some stumbling blocks to make its\r\nconsummation difficult. It is an art in which rules do not suffice,\r\nfor no two vineyards can be pruned alike in amount or method, and\r\nevery grape-grower finds his vineyard a proper field for the\r\ngratification of his taste in pruning. Happily, however, enlightened\r\ntheory and sound practice are in perfect accord in grape-pruning, so\r\nthat specific advice is well founded on governing principles.\r\n\r\nOne cannot, of course, learn to prune unless he understands the habit\r\nof the grape-vine and is familiar with the terms applied to the\r\ndifferent parts of the vine. As a preliminary to this chapter,\r\ntherefore, knowledge of Chapter XVII, in which the structure of the\r\ngrape-vine is discussed, is necessary. The next step is to distinguish\r\nbetween pruning and training.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING AND TRAINING DISTINGUISHED\r\n\r\nThe grape is pruned to increase in various ways the economic value of\r\nthe plant by increasing the quantity and value of the crop. This is\r\npruning proper. Or grapes are pruned to make well-proportioned plants\r\nwith the parts so disposed that the vines are to the highest degree\r\nmanageable in the vineyard. This is training. To repeat, the\r\ngrape-plant is pruned to regulate the crop; it is trained to regulate\r\nthe vine. Grape-growers usually speak of both operations as \"pruning,\"\r\nbut it is better to keep in mind the two conceptions. The distinctions\r\nbetween pruning and training must be made more apparent by setting\r\nforth in greater detail the results attained by the two operations.\r\n\r\n_Results attained in pruning to regulate the crop._\r\n\r\nProper pruning of vines in their first year in the vineyard, which, as\r\nwe have seen, consists of cutting the young plants back severely,\r\nbrings the vines in productive bearing a year or two years earlier\r\nthan they would have borne had the pruning been neglected. This early\r\npruning, since it is done with an eye to the vigor of each vine,\r\ninsures greater uniformity in the growth and productiveness of the\r\nvineyard. Uniformity thus brought about is important not only for the\r\ntime being, but for the future development of the vines, since weak\r\nvines, if unpruned, are stunted and may require years to overtake more\r\nvigorous vines in the vineyard.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the crop may be regulated by pruning. When vines bear\r\ntoo heavily, the grapes are small, and wine-makers have found that\r\nthey seldom develop sugar and flavor as do grapes on vines not\r\nover-bearing. Grapes on vines too heavily laden seldom ripen or color\r\nwell. Not only are the grapes on poorly pruned and unpruned vines poor\r\nin quality but the grapes on such vines are usually not well\r\ndistributed and therefore ripen and color unevenly. The results just\r\nmentioned follow because the bunches in a poorly distributed crop\r\nreceive varying amounts of light and heat depending on the distance\r\nfrom the ground, the distance from the trunk and on the amount of\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nPruning may be used to regulate the quantity of grapes borne in a\r\nvineyard and so be made somewhat helpful in preventing alternate\r\nbearing. Abnormally large crops are usually followed by partial crop\r\nfailure and biennial bearing sometimes sets in, but the large crop may\r\nbe reduced by pruning and the evil consequences wholly or partly\r\navoided. It follows that pruning must depend much on the vigor of the\r\nvine; for a weak vine may be so pruned as to cause it to overbear;\r\nand, on the other hand, a vigorous vine pruned in the same way might\r\nnot bear at all.\r\n\r\n_Results attained in pruning to regulate the vine._\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to regulate the shape of the vine by training so that\r\ntilling, spraying, pruning and harvesting can be easily performed and\r\nthe crop be kept off the ground. The cost of production is always less\r\nin a well-pruned vineyard because all vineyard operations are more\r\neasily carried out.\r\n\r\nThe life of a vineyard is lengthened when the vines are well trained,\r\nbecause when the parts of a vine are properly disposed on trellis or\r\nstake the plants are less often injured in vineyard operations.\r\nMoreover, not infrequently vines die from over-production and\r\nconsequent breaking of canes or trunks which might have been prevented\r\nby pruning to shape the vine. Suckers and water-sprouts are less\r\ncommon on well-trained vines. It is necessary, too, by training to\r\nkeep the bunches away from trunk, canes and other bunches and so\r\nprevent injury to the grapes.\r\n\r\nLastly, fashion, taste or a more or less abnormal use of the grapes,\r\nmay prescribe the form in which a vine is trained. Fashion and taste\r\nrun from very simple or natural styles to exceedingly complex, formal\r\nones, depending, often, on the variety, the environment or other\r\ncondition, but just as often on the whim of the grape-grower. The\r\ngrape is a favorite ornamental for fences, arbors and to cover\r\nbuildings; for all of these purposes the vines must be trained as\r\noccasion calls.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PRINCIPLES OF PRUNING\r\n\r\nLeaving the shaping of the plant out of consideration and having in\r\nmind pruning proper, all efforts in pruning are directed toward two\r\nobjects: (1) The production of leafy shoots to increase the vigor of\r\nthe plant. (2) The promotion of the formation of fruit-buds. The\r\nfirst, in common parlance, is pruning for wood; the second, pruning\r\nfor fruit.\r\n\r\n_Pruning for wood._\r\n\r\nSome grapes, in common with varieties of all fruits, produce excessive\r\ncrops of fruit so that the plants exhaust themselves, to their\r\npermanent injury and to the detriment of the crop. Something must be\r\ndone to restore and increase vegetative vigor. The most natural\r\nprocedure is to lessen the struggle for existence among the parts of\r\nthe plant. The richer and the more abundant the supply of the food\r\nsolution, the greater the vegetative activity, the larger the leaves\r\nand the larger and stouter the internodes. Obviously, the supply of\r\nfood solution for each bud may be increased by decreasing the number\r\nof buds. The weaker the plants, therefore, the more the vine should be\r\ncut. The severe pruning in the first two years of the vine's existence\r\nis an example of pruning for wood. The vine is pruned for wood in the\r\nresting period between the fall of leaf and the swelling of buds the\r\nfollowing spring.\r\n\r\n_Pruning for fruit._\r\n\r\nGrowers of all fruits soon learn that excessive vegetative vigor is\r\nnot usually accompanied by fruitfulness. Too great vigor is indicated\r\nby long, leafy, unbranching shoots. Some fruit-growers go so far as to\r\nsay that fruitfulness is inversely proportionate to vegetative vigor.\r\nThere are several methods of diminishing the vigor of the vine; as,\r\nwithholding water and fertilizers, stopping tillage, the method of\r\ntraining and by pruning. Pruning is used to decrease the vigor of the\r\nvine, in theory at least, for the practice is not always so\r\nsuccessful, by pruning the roots or by summer-pruning the shoots.\r\n\r\nRoot-pruning the grape at intervals of several years is a regular\r\npractice with some varieties in warm countries, Europe more\r\nespecially, but is seldom or never practiced in America except when\r\nplanting and when roots arise from the cion above the union of stock\r\nand cion.\r\n\r\nSummer-pruning to induce fruitfulness consists in removing new shoots\r\nwith newly developed leaves. These young shoots have been developed\r\nfrom reserve material stored up the preceding season, and until they\r\nare so far developed that they can perform the functions of leaves\r\nthey are to be counted as parasites. When, therefore, these shoots are\r\npruned or pinched away, the plant is robbed of the material used by\r\nthe lusty shoot which up to this time has given nothing in return. The\r\nvigor of the plant is thus checked and fruitfulness increased.\r\nSummer-pruning may become harmful if delayed too long. The time to\r\nprune is past with the grape when the leaves have passed from the\r\nlight green color of new growth to the dark green of mature leaves.\r\n\r\nFruit-bearing may be augmented by bending, twisting or ringing the\r\ncanes, since all of these operations diminish vegetative vigor.\r\nRinging is the only one of these methods in general use, and this only\r\nfor some special variety or special purpose, and usually with the\r\nresult that the vigor of the vine is diminished too much for the good\r\nof the plant. Ringing is discussed more fully in Chapter XVI.\r\n\r\n_The manner of fruit-bearing in the grape._\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to prune, the pruner must understand precisely how\r\nthe grape bears its crop. The fruit is borne near the base of the\r\nshoots of the current season, and the shoots are borne on the wood of\r\nthe previous year's growth coming from a dormant bud. Here is\r\nmanifested one of Nature's energy-saving devices, shoot, leaves,\r\nflowers and fruit spring in a short season from a single bud. In the\r\nlight of this fact, pruning should be looked on as a simple problem to\r\nbe solved mathematically and not as a puzzle to be untangled, as so\r\nmany regard it. For an example, a problem in pruning is here stated\r\nand solved.\r\n\r\nA thrifty grape-vine should yield, let us say, fifteen pounds of\r\ngrapes, a fair average for the mainstay varieties. Each bunch will\r\nweigh from a quarter to a half pound. To produce fifteen pounds on a\r\nvine, therefore, will require from thirty to sixty bunches. As each\r\nshoot will bear two or three bunches, from fifteen to thirty buds must\r\nbe left on the canes of the preceding year. These buds are selected in\r\npruning on one or more canes distributed on one or two main stems in\r\nsuch manner as the pruner may choose, but usually in accordance with\r\none or another of several well-developed methods of training. Pruning,\r\nthen, consists in calculating the number of bunches and buds necessary\r\nand removing the remainder. In essence pruning is thinning.\r\n\r\n_Horizontal_ versus _perpendicular canes._\r\n\r\nAn old dictum of viticulture is that the nearer the growing parts of\r\nthe vine approach the perpendicular, the more vigorous the parts. The\r\nterminal buds, as every grape-grower knows, grow very rapidly and\r\nprobably absorb, unless checked, more than their share of the energy\r\nof the vine. This tendency can be checked somewhat by removing the\r\nterminal buds, which also helps to keep the plants within manageable\r\nlimits, but is better controlled by training the canes to horizontal\r\npositions. Grape canes are tied horizontally to wires to make the\r\nvines more manageable and to reduce their vigor and so induce\r\nfruitfulness; they are trained vertically to increase the vigor of the\r\nvine.\r\n\r\n_Winter-pruning._\r\n\r\nWinter-pruning of the vineyard may be done at any time from the\r\ndropping of the leaves in the autumn to the swelling of the buds in\r\nthe spring. The sap begins to circulate actively in the grape early in\r\nthe spring, even to the extremities of the vine, and most\r\ngrape-growers believe this sap to be a \"vital stream\" and that, if the\r\nvine is pruned during its flow, the plant will bleed to death. The\r\nvine, however, is at this season of so dropsical a constitution that\r\nthe loss of sap is better denominated \"weeping\" than \"bleeding.\" It is\r\ndoubtful whether serious injury results from pruning after the sap\r\nbegins to flow, but it is a safe practice to prune earlier and the\r\nwork is certainly pleasanter. The vine should not be pruned when the\r\nwood is frozen, since at this time the canes are brittle and easily\r\nbroken in handling. On the other hand, it is well to delay pruning in\r\nnorthern climates until after a heavy freeze in the autumn, to\r\nwinterkill and wither immature wood so that it can be removed in\r\npruning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IX.--Campbell Early (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n_Summer-pruning._\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of summer-pruning, the removal of superfluous\r\nshoots, heading-in canes to keep the vines in manageable limits and\r\nthe pruning to induce fruitfulness discussed on a foregoing page,\r\nwhich need not have further consideration. It is very essential that\r\nthe grower keep these three purposes in mind, especially as there is\r\nmuch dispute as to the necessity of two of these operations.\r\n\r\nAll agree that the vine usually bears superfluous shoots that should\r\nbe removed. These are such as spring from small, weak buds or from\r\nbuds on the arms and trunk of the vine. These shoots are useless,\r\ndevitalize the vine, and hinder vineyard operations. A good practice\r\nis to rub off the buds from which these shoots grow as they are\r\ndetected, but in most vineyards the vines must be gone over from time\r\nto time as the shoots appear. Still another kind of superfluous\r\nshoots, which ought to be removed as they appear, are those which grow\r\nfrom the base of the season's shoots, the so-called secondary or\r\naxillary shoots. These are usually \"broken out\" at the time the shoots\r\nfrom weak buds are removed.\r\n\r\nWhile there is doubt as to the value of heading-back the vine in the\r\nsummer for the sole purpose of inducing fruitfulness, there can be no\r\ndoubt that it is desirable for the purpose of keeping some varieties\r\nwithin bounds. Heading-back is not now the major operation it once\r\nwas, the need of severe cutting being obviated by putting the vines\r\nfarther apart, by training high on three or even four wires and by\r\nadopting one of the drooping systems of training. The objections to\r\nheading-back in the summer are that it often unduly weakens the vines,\r\nthat it may induce a growth of laterals which thicken the vines too\r\nmuch, and that it delays the maturing of the wood. These bad effects,\r\nhowever, can be overcome by pruning lightly and doing the work so late\r\nin the season that lateral growths will not start. Most vineyardists\r\nwho keep their plantations up find it necessary to head back more or\r\nless, depending on the season and the variety. The work is usually\r\ndone when the over-luxuriant shoots begin to touch the ground. The\r\nshoots are then topped off with a sickle, corn-cutter or similar tool.\r\n\r\n\r\nRENEWING FRUITING WOOD\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of renewing the fruiting wood on a grape-vine, by\r\ncanes and from spurs. The manner of renewing refers to pruning and not\r\nto training, for either can be used in any method of training.\r\n\r\n_Cane renewals._\r\n\r\nRenewal by canes is made each year by taking one or more canes, cut to\r\nthe desired number of buds, to supply bearing shoots. By this method\r\nthe most of the bearing wood is removed each year, new canes taking\r\nthe place of the old. These renewal canes may be taken either from the\r\nhead of the vine or from the ground, though the latter is little used\r\nexcept where vines must be laid down for winter protection. Canes may\r\nbe renewed indefinitely, if care is exercised in keeping the stubs\r\nshort, without enlarging the head from which the canes are taken out\r\nof proportion to the size of the trunk. Renewing by canes is a more\r\ncommon method than renewal by spurs, as will be found in the\r\ndiscussion of methods of training.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. Vine ready for pruning; _i_, the stem; _g_,\r\narms; _d_, canes; _s_, shoots; _b_, spurs. The faint lines near the\r\nbases of the canes indicate the points where they should be pruned off\r\nin the winter, leaving spurs for the production of shoots the\r\nfollowing season.]\r\n\r\n_Spur renewal._\r\n\r\nIn renewing by spurs, a permanent arm is established to right and left\r\non the canes. Shoots on this arm are not permitted to remain as canes\r\nbut are cut back to spurs in the dormant pruning. Two buds are left at\r\nthis pruning, both of which will produce bearing shoots; the lower\r\none, however, is not suffered to do so but is kept to furnish the spur\r\nfor the next season. The shoot from the upper bud is cut away\r\nentirely. When this process is carried on from year to year, the spurs\r\nbecome longer and longer until they become unwieldy. Occasionally,\r\nhowever, happy chance permits the selection of a shoot on the old wood\r\nfor a new spur. Failing in this, a new arm must be laid down and the\r\nspurring goes on as before. The objections to renewing by spurs are:\r\nit is often difficult to replace spurs with new wood, and the bearing\r\nportion of the vine gets farther and farther from the trunk. For these\r\nreasons, spur-renewing is generally in disfavor with commercial\r\ngrape-growers, though it is still used in one or two prominent\r\nmethods of training, as will be discovered in this discussion. Figure\r\n13 shows a vine ready for pruning.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORK OF PRUNING\r\n\r\nThe pruner may take his choice between several styles of hand\r\npruning-shears with which to do his work. The knife is seldom used\r\nexcept in summer-pruning, and here, more often, the shoots are broken\r\nout or pinched out. In winter-pruning, the cane is cut an inch or\r\nthereabout beyond the last bud it is desired to leave; otherwise the\r\nbud may die from the drying out of the cane. The canes are usually\r\nallowed to remain tied to the wires until the pruning is done, though\r\ngrowers who use the Kniffin method of training may cut them loose\r\nbefore they prune. Two men working together do the work of pruning\r\nbest. The more skilled of the two severs the wood from the bearing\r\nvine, leaving just the number of buds desired for the next season's\r\ncrop. The less skilled man cuts tendrils and severs the cut canes from\r\neach other so that the prunings may be moved from the vineyard without\r\ntrouble by the \"stripper.\"\r\n\r\nNot the least of the tasks of pruning is \"stripping\" the brush and\r\ngetting it out of the vineyard. The prunings cling to the trellis with\r\nconsiderable tenacity and must be pulled loose with a peculiar jerk,\r\nlearned by practice, and placed on the ground between the rows.\r\nStripping is done, usually by cheap labor, at any time after the\r\npruning until spring, but must not be delayed until growth starts or\r\nthe young buds may suffer as the cut wood is torn from the trellis.\r\nThe brush is hauled to the end of the row by hand or by horse-power\r\napplied to any one of a dozen devices used in the several grape\r\nregions. One of the best is the device in common use in the Chautauqua\r\nvineyards of western New York. A pole, twelve feet long, four inches\r\nin diameter at the butt and two at the top, is bored with an inch\r\nhole four feet from the butt. A horse is hitched to this pole by a\r\nrope drawn through the hole, and the pole, butt to the ground, is then\r\npulled between rows, the small end being held in the right hand. The\r\npole, when skillfully used, collects the brush, which is dumped at the\r\nend of the row by letting the small end fly over towards the horse.\r\nThe \"go-devil,\" shown in Fig. 14, is another common device for\r\ncollecting prunings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14. A \"go-devil\" for collecting prunings.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRELLIS\r\n\r\nThe trellis is a considerable item in the grape-grower's budget, since\r\nit must be renewed every fifteen years or thereabouts. Wires are\r\nstrung in the North at the end of the second season after planting,\r\nbut in the South the growth is often so great that the wires must be\r\nput up at the end of the first season. Trellises are of the same\r\ngeneral style for commercial vineyards; namely, two or three wires\r\ntautly stretched on firmly set posts. Occasionally slat trellises are\r\nput up in gardens but these are not to be recommended for any but\r\nornamental purposes.\r\n\r\n_Posts._\r\n\r\nStrong, durable posts of chestnut, locust, cedar, oak or reënforced\r\ncement are placed at such distance apart that two or three vines can\r\nbe set between each two posts. The distance apart depends on the\r\ndistance between vines, although the tendency now is to have three\r\nvines between two posts. The posts are from six to eight feet in\r\nlength, the heaviest being used as end posts. In hard stony soils it\r\nmay be necessary to set the end posts with a spade, but usually\r\nsharpened posts can be driven into holes made with a crowbar. In\r\ndriving, the operator stands on a wagon hauled by a horse and uses a\r\nten- or twelve-pound maul. The posts are driven to a depth of eighteen\r\nor twenty-four inches for the end posts. However set, the posts must\r\nstand firm to hold the load of vines and fruit. The end posts must be\r\nbraced. As good a brace as any is made from a four-by-four timber,\r\nnotched to fit the post halfway up from the ground, and extending\r\nobliquely to the ground, where it is held by a four-by-four stake. A\r\ntwo-wire trellis and a common method of bracing end posts are shown in\r\nFig. 15. The posts on hillsides must lean slightly up-hill, otherwise\r\nthey will almost certainly sooner or later tilt down the slope. The\r\nposts are usually permitted to stand a little higher at first than\r\nnecessary so that they may be driven down should occasion call;\r\ndriving is usually done in the early spring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. A trellis and a common method of bracing end\r\nposts.]\r\n\r\n_Wire for the trellis._\r\n\r\nFour sizes of wire are in common use for vineyard trellises; nos. 9,\r\n10, 11 and 12. Number 9, the heaviest, is often used for the top wire\r\nwith lighter wires lower. The following figures show the length of\r\nwire in a ton:\r\n\r\n    No.  9, 34,483 ft.\r\n    No. 10, 41,408 ft.\r\n    No. 11, 52,352 ft.\r\n    No. 12, 68,493 ft.\r\n\r\nFrom these figures the number of pounds required to the acre is easily\r\ncalculated. Common annealed wire makes a durable trellis, but many\r\ngrowers prefer the more durable galvanized wire, the cost of which is\r\nslightly greater. The wires are fastened to the end posts by winding\r\nonce around the post, and then each wire is firmly looped about\r\nitself; they are secured to the intervening posts by ordinary fence\r\nstaples so driven that the wire cannot pull through of its own weight\r\nbut with space enough to permit tightening from season to season. The\r\nsize and length of the staples depend on whether the posts are hard or\r\nsoft wood. The longest and largest staples are used with soft woods,\r\nas cedar or chestnut. An acre requires from nine to twelve pounds of\r\nstaples. The wires should be placed on the windward sides of posts and\r\non the up-hill side in hillside vineyards. The distance between wires\r\ndepends on the method of pruning.\r\n\r\nThe wires must be stretched taut on the posts, for which purpose any\r\none of a half-dozen good wire stretchers may be purchased at hardware\r\nstores. Some growers loosen the wires after harvest to allow for the\r\ncontraction in cold weather and others use some one of several devices\r\nto relieve the strain. Most growers, however, find it necessary to go\r\nover the vineyard each spring to drive down loosened posts and stretch\r\nsagging wires, and so take no precautions to release wires in the\r\nfall. All agree that the wires must be kept tight during the growing\r\nseason to protect buds, foliage and fruit from being injured from\r\nwhipping.\r\n\r\n_Tying._\r\n\r\nThe canes are tied to the trellis in early spring, and under most\r\nsystems of pruning the growing shoots are tied in the summer. This\r\nwork is done by cheap men, women, boys and girls. A great variety of\r\nmaterial is used to make the tie, as raffia, wooltwine, willow, inner\r\nbark of the linden or basswood, green rye straw, corn husks,\r\ncarpet-rags and wire. The same materials are not usually employed for\r\nboth canes and shoots, since the canes are tied firmly to hold them\r\nsteady and the work is done early before there is danger of breaking\r\nswelling buds, while the summer shoots are tied to hold for a shorter\r\ntime and more loosely to permit growth in diameter. Tying usually\r\nfollows accepted patterns in one region but varies greatly in\r\ndifferent regions. There is a knack to be learned in the use of each\r\none of the materials named, but with none is it difficult, and an\r\ningenious person can easily contrive a tie of his own to suit fancy or\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE X.--Clinton (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF TRAINING GRAPES IN EASTERN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grape-grower takes great liberties with Nature in training his\r\nplants. No other fruit is so completely transformed by the grower's\r\nart from its natural habit of growth. Happily, the grape endures\r\ncutting well, and the pruner may rest assured that he may work his\r\nwill in pruning his vines, following to his heart's desire a favorite\r\nmethod with little fear of seriously injuring his vines. Because of\r\nits accommodation to the desires of man in the disposition of the\r\nvine, there are many methods of training the grape; there being in the\r\ncommercial vineyards of eastern America a dozen or more. However, the\r\ndifferences and similarities are so marked that the several methods\r\nfall into a simple classification which makes conspicuous their chief\r\nfeatures. Thus, all of the methods fall under two chief heads: (1) The\r\ndisposition of shoots; (2) the disposition of canes.\r\n\r\n_The disposition of shoots._\r\n\r\nBearing shoots are disposed of in three ways in training grapes;\r\nshoots upright, shoots drooping, and shoots horizontal. The terms\r\nexplain themselves, but the three methods need amplification since\r\ntheir adoption is not optional with growers but depends on several\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nShoots are trained upright in several methods in which two or more\r\narms or canes are laid to right and left, sometimes horizontally,\r\nsometimes obliquely along or across horizontal wires. As the shoots\r\ngrow upward, they are tied to wires above. The upright methods are\r\nsupposed to distribute the bearing wood more evenly on the vines and\r\nto insure greater uniformity in the fruit. In the upright methods,\r\nalso, the canes and arms are left nearer the ground, which is thought\r\nto be an advantage in small, weak or slow-growing varieties. Delaware,\r\nCatawba, Iona and Diana are examples of varieties thought to grow best\r\nwhen trained to one of the upright methods.\r\n\r\nIn the several methods in which the shoots droop, however the canes\r\nmay be disposed, the shoots are not tied but are allowed to droop at\r\nwill. These methods are comparatively new but are being rapidly\r\nadopted because of several marked advantages. Usually one less wire\r\ncan be used in a drooping method than in an upright one; since the\r\nshoots are not tied, much labor is saved in summer tying; the ground\r\ncan be tilled with less danger to the vines; and there is less\r\nsun-scalding of the fruit, since the pendant foliage protects the\r\nclusters. Grape-growers generally agree that strong-growing varieties\r\nlike Concord, Niagara, Brighton, Diamond and most of the hybrids\r\nbetween European grapes and native species grow best when the shoots\r\ndroop.\r\n\r\nShoots are trained horizontally in but one recognized method, the\r\nHudson Horizontal, to be described in detail later. Since this method\r\nis all but obsolete, there is still less reason for discussing it\r\nhere, the expressive name sufficing for present purposes.\r\n\r\n_Disposition of canes._\r\n\r\nThere are many recognized methods of disposing of the canes in\r\ntraining the grape. The chief of these are discussed in the pages that\r\nfollow, their names being set down for the present in the\r\nclassification that follows.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF METHODS OF TRAINING THE GRAPE IN EASTERN AMERICA\r\n\r\n    I. Shoots upright:\r\n\r\n      1. Chautauqua Arm.\r\n      2. Keuka High Renewal.\r\n      3. Fan.\r\n\r\n    II. Shoots drooping:\r\n\r\n      1. Single-stem, Four-cane Kniffin.\r\n      2.

Shoots upright_\r\n\r\nSystematic training of the grape in America began toward the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century with a method in which the shoots were trained\r\nupright from two permanent horizontal arms. These arms are laid to\r\nright and left on a low wire and bear more or less permanent spurs,\r\nfrom each of which two shoots are produced each season to bear the\r\ncrop. The number of spurs left on each arm depends on the vigor of the\r\nvine and the space between vines. As the shoots grow upward, they are\r\ntied to upper wires, there being three wires on the trellis for this\r\nmethod. This method is now known as the Horizontal Arm Spur. It has a\r\nserious fault in its troublesome spurs and has almost entirely given\r\nway to a modification called the Chautauqua Arm method, much used in\r\nthe great Chautauqua grape-belt. As one of the chief methods of\r\ntraining the grape in eastern America, this must be described in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n_The Chautauqua Arm method._\r\n\r\nThe trellis for this method has two wires, although occasionally three\r\nare used. The lower wire is eighteen or twenty inches above the\r\nground and the second thirty-four inches above the lower. If three are\r\nused, the wires are twenty inches apart. F. E. Gladwin, in charge of\r\nthe vineyard laboratory of the New York Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation at Fredonia, in the heart of the Chautauqua belt, describes\r\nthis method of training as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The vines are cut back to two buds at each pruning the first two\r\nyears. If the vines are vigorous two canes are tied up at the\r\nbeginning of the third year; if scant, but one is left and this, if\r\nthe growth is extremely unfavorable, is cut back to two buds. The\r\ncanes are carried up obliquely to the upper wire when the growth\r\npermits and are there firmly tied either with twine or fine wire, the\r\nlatter being more commonly used. The canes are also loosely tied to\r\nthe lower wire. The pruning for the fourth year consists in cutting\r\naway all but two or three canes and a number of spurs from the arms\r\nformed by tying up the two canes the previous year. The vine now\r\nconsists of two arms, arising from near the ground, with two or three\r\ncanes of the previous year, and several two-bud spurs at intervals\r\nalong the arms. As far as possible such canes as have arisen but a\r\nshort distance above the lower wire are selected. All the old wood\r\nprojecting beyond the last cane retained on each of the arms is cut\r\naway. The arms of the third year are bent down from their oblique\r\nposition and are tied firmly to the lower wire, to the right and left\r\nof the center of the vine. These are now permanent arms. The vine at\r\nthis time consists of two arms, arising from near the ground, tied to\r\nthe lower wire to the right and left of the center, and on these are\r\ntwo or three canes, pruned long enough to reach to the middle wire at\r\nleast, and if possible to the upper. They are tied so that they stand\r\nin a vertical or oblique position. Along the arms at intervals of a\r\nfew inches are spurs, consisting of two buds. If the vineyardist\r\nmaintains the arms permanently, these spurs furnish the fruiting wood\r\nfor the succeeding year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. Chautauqua training; vine ready to prune.]\r\n\r\n\"At the pruning for the fifth year one of the arms is cut away\r\nentirely, close to the point of its origin. The remaining arm,\r\nreaching from the ground to a point a few inches below the level of\r\nthe lower wire, now becomes the permanent stem. The vineyardist must\r\nnow provide for the arm cut away. This is done by the selection of a\r\ncane, arising from the remaining arm at a point below the lower wire,\r\neither directly, or from a spur left for the purpose. This is pruned\r\nto reach the top wire and is tied obliquely to it. This cane at the\r\nnext pruning is tied down to the lower wire and becomes the second\r\narm. Then the same selection of canes and spurs is made from it as was\r\nmade at the previous pruning, and the canes are tied up as before.\r\nHowever, if the grower desires to retain both arms of the preceding\r\nyear for a few years, canes that have grown from the spurs may be tied\r\nup and provision made for the following year through further spurring.\r\nIf but a single arm is retained, it is pruned in the same way. Spurs\r\nmay be obtained from canes that have arisen from dormant buds on the\r\narm, or by spurring in the basal canes of the fruiting wood of the\r\nyear previous. A combination of both methods of renewal will in the\r\nlong run work out the better, as the repeated spurring in of the basal\r\ncanes will result in greatly lengthened spurs that will require\r\nfrequent cutting out. While the canes that arise directly from dormant\r\nbuds on wood two years and over are not necessarily the best fruiting\r\nones, they can, however, be utilized for renewal purposes.\r\n\r\n\"The ideal vine pruned to this system now consists of a stem reaching\r\nfrom sixteen or eighteen inches above the ground level or a few inches\r\nbelow the level of the lower wire. Such a vine is shown in Figure 16.\r\nFrom the head two arms arise, one extending to the right, the other to\r\nthe left and tied along the lower wire, each arm not extending for\r\nmore than two feet and a half to either side of the head. From the\r\narms two canes on each are tied vertically or obliquely to the top\r\nwire. In addition there are left two or three spurs, growing from the\r\nupper side of each arm, located at well-spaced intervals starting\r\nclose to the head; these may be used for the renewal of the arms. The\r\nshoots are not tied.\r\n\r\n\"One of the chief faults of the Chautauqua Arm method is the tendency\r\nof the best matured, and most desirable canes to develop at or near\r\nthe upper wire, while those lower down are often too short, or so\r\npoorly matured as to be unfitted for fruiting purposes. When the wood,\r\nbearing the well-developed upper canes, is brought down for arms, a\r\nconsiderable interval of the arm from the head to the point where the\r\ncanes arise is without fruiting wood. Under such conditions the growth\r\nwill be again thrown to the extremities. If spurring on the arms has\r\nbeen practiced, this undesirable condition is eliminated. With either\r\ntype of renewal, spurring should be practiced. The fruit from vines\r\ntrained by this method reaches its highest development at or near the\r\nlevel of the upper wire, that on the lower shoots is, as a rule, quite\r\ninferior. This comes from the fact that the sap flow is more vigorous\r\nat these upper points, resulting in more and healthier leaves, which,\r\nin turn, influence the fruit for the better.\"\r\n\r\n_Keuka High Renewal._\r\n\r\nSeveral methods of training pass under the general term \"High\r\nRenewal,\" the significance of which becomes apparent in the discussion\r\nof the Keuka High Renewal method which is probably now the most common\r\nof the several types. In most of these methods the trellis is put up\r\nwith three wires, but occasionally only two wires are used and still\r\nless often four. The lowest wire on the three-wire trellis is eighteen\r\nor twenty inches from the ground with twenty-inch intervals between\r\nwires. Gladwin, who has direct charge of vineyard experimental work\r\nabout Keuka Lake for the New York Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\ndescribes current practices in pruning according to this method as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"At each pruning for the first two years the vines are cut back to two\r\nbuds. However, with strong-growing varieties like Concord, Niagara and\r\nIsabella, and under good soil conditions, the stem may be formed the\r\nsecond year. With moderate-growing varieties and under average\r\nconditions, the formation of the stem is left until the third year.\r\nThe straightest and best-matured cane is left for the purpose. This is\r\ncarried to the lower wire and there firmly tied with willow. As soon\r\nas the shoots have made sufficient growth they are loosely tied to the\r\nwires that they may be kept away from the tillage tools. The fourth\r\nyear the head of the vine is formed. This should stand a few inches\r\nbelow the lower wire. Two canes growing from the stem near this\r\nposition are selected, one being tied to the right and the other to\r\nthe left along the lower wire. In the Keuka Lake District, the canes\r\nare tied with willows. In addition, at least two spurs of two buds\r\neach are retained near the head. With Concord, the canes may carry\r\nabout ten buds each, but with Catawba, as grown on the hillsides of\r\nthe Central Lakes Region of New York, the canes should not carry above\r\nsix buds each. As the shoots develop from the horizontal canes, they\r\nare tied with rye straw to the middle and upper wires. This summer\r\ntying is almost continuous after the shoots are long enough to reach\r\nthe middle wire.\r\n\r\n\"The following year all the wood is cut away except two or three canes\r\nthat have developed from the basal buds of the canes put up the\r\nprevious year, or that have grown from the spurs. In the event of a\r\nthird cane being retained, it is tied along the middle wire. Spurs are\r\nagain maintained close to the head for renewal purposes. The other two\r\ncanes are tied along the lower wire as before. If the same spurs are\r\nused for a few years they become so long that the canes arising from\r\nthem reach above the wire and cannot be well managed in the\r\n'willowing.' It is desirable to provide new spurs annually, selecting\r\nthose canes for the purpose that arise from the head of the vine or\r\nnear it. It is possible by careful pruning to so cut away the old wood\r\nthat practically all that remains after each pruning is the stem. Thus\r\nthe vine is renewed almost to the ground. When the stem approaches the\r\nend of its usefulness, a shoot is allowed to grow from the ground, and\r\nthe old one is cut away. Figure 17 shows a vine pruned by the Keuka\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. Keuka method of training.]\r\n\r\n\"This method of training is especially well adapted to slow growing\r\nvarieties, or those situated on poor soils, where but little wood\r\ngrowth is made. It is ideally adapted for the growing of Catawba on\r\nthe hillsides of Keuka Lake. It is well adapted to late-maturing\r\nvarieties planted out of their zone. Concord, growing under average\r\nconditions, is too vigorous to be trained by this method. It makes a\r\ntremendous growth of wood out of all proportion to the quantity of\r\nfruit, which is inclined to be very inferior. The chief objection to\r\nthis method is the amount of summer tying involved which comes at a\r\ntime when attention to tillage should be given. It might prove\r\nprofitable in the growing of dessert varieties that have been\r\ndiscarded because of lack of vigor. On thin hillside soils, Catawba\r\nrequires training modelled after this method but on the heavier upland\r\nones, with shorter pruning, it can be grown on the Chautauqua Arm\r\nplan. Delaware, Iona, Dutchess, Campbell, Eumelan, Jessica, Vergennes\r\nand Regal are, as a rule, grown to better advantage when trained by\r\nthe High Renewal method.\"\r\n\r\n_Fan-training._\r\n\r\nThe only other method now in use in which the shoots may be trained\r\nupright is that in which the canes are disposed of in fan-shape. This\r\nmethod was much used a generation ago but is rapidly becoming\r\nobsolete. In fan-training the renewals are made yearly from spurs near\r\nthe ground, and the fruiting canes are carried up obliquely and so\r\nform a fan. The great advantage in fan-training is that a trunk is\r\nalmost dispensed with, which greatly facilitates laying down the vine\r\nin winter where winter-protection is needed. There are several\r\nobjections to this method in commercial plantations. The chief one is\r\nthat the spurs become long, crooked and almost unmanageable so that\r\nrenewals from the root must be made frequently. Another is that the\r\nfruit is borne close to the ground and becomes soiled with mud in\r\ndashing rains. The vines, also, are inconvenient in shape for tying.\r\nThere are two or three modifications of fan-training which may be\r\ndescribed as mongrel methods between this and the High Renewal and\r\nHorizontal Arm methods, none of which, however, is now in general\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_II. Shoots drooping_\r\n\r\nQuite by accident, William Kniffin, a stone mason living at\r\nClintondale, New York, in the Hudson River grape region, discovered\r\nthat grapes of large size and handsome appearance could be grown on\r\nvines in which the canes were trained horizontally with the shoots\r\ndrooping. He put his discovery in practice and from it have come the\r\nseveral methods of training grapes which bear his name. Kniffin's\r\ndiscovery was made about 1850 and the merits of his methods spread so\r\nrapidly over eastern America that by the end of the century the\r\nvarious Kniffin methods were more generally used than any others.\r\nGrape-growers now agree that strong-growing vines like Concord,\r\nNiagara and Clinton are best trained to one or another of the Kniffin\r\nmethods. There are several modifications of Kniffin's method, three of\r\nwhich are now in common use, the most popular being the Single-stem,\r\nFour-cane Kniffin.\r\n\r\nThe trellis for the three methods carries two wires, the lower placed\r\nat the height of three to three and a half feet and the upper from two\r\nto two and a half feet above it. To permit this height of wires, the\r\nposts must be from eight to eight and a half feet in length, and must\r\nbe firmly set with the end posts well braced.\r\n\r\n_Single-stem, Four-cane Kniffin._\r\n\r\nAs practiced at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, the\r\nvines are trained as follows:\r\n\r\nOne trunk is carried to the top wire the third year after planting, or\r\nif the growth is not long enough at this time, it is carried to the\r\nlower wire and there tied. In this case, the following year a cane is\r\nextended to the top wire. This trunk is permanent. If the stem reaches\r\nthe upper wire the third year, growers break out many of the\r\ndeveloping shoots and allow only the strongest to grow, choosing those\r\nthat arise close to the wires. The stem should be tied tightly to the\r\ntop wire and somewhat loosely to the lower. If girdling results at the\r\ntop, it is not objectionable as the head of the vine should be below\r\nrather than above the wire. When the shoots are sufficiently hardened,\r\nthose growing close to the wires should be loosely tied to prevent\r\ninjury during cultivation. At the beginning of the fourth year, as\r\nshown in Fig. 18, the vine should consist of a stem extending from the\r\nground to a point below the top wire. From this, all but two canes and\r\ntwo spurs of two buds each have been cut away below each wire level.\r\nAs growth is most vigorous at the top of the stem, four to six more\r\nbuds are left on the upper than on the lower canes. A vine of which\r\nthe stem reaches the upper wire the third year should support the next\r\nseason canes, aggregating twenty-two buds with eight additional buds\r\non the spurs. If the growth is weak, only half this number should be\r\nleft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. Single-stem, Four-cane Kniffin training.]\r\n\r\nThe tying at this time consists of fastening the stem loosely, with\r\nordinary grape twine, to the lower wire, and with the same material\r\nthe canes are tied along the two wires to right and left of the stem.\r\nThe canes should be tied tightly toward the trunk so that they cannot\r\nslip out of the twine. Ordinarily tying at this time is sufficient for\r\nthe year, but if conditions for growth are unfavorable, the twine may\r\nrot before the tendrils take hold of the wires, and a partial second\r\ntying may be necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter the fourth season, the pruner has greater choice of\r\nfruiting-wood for the following year. It may be chosen from the basal\r\ncanes of the preceding year's wood or the canes that develop from the\r\nspurs may be used. The choice should depend on the accessibility and\r\nmaturity of the wood. At each pruning, the possibilities for obtaining\r\nfruiting wood for the following year must receive consideration. It is\r\npossible to use the same spurs for two or three years, but after this\r\nthey should be cut away and new ones retained. After the first\r\nspurring, spurs should be selected from wood older than two years. The\r\nshoots from such wood bear but little fruit and hence make good\r\nfruiting canes for the next year.\r\n\r\n_Umbrella Kniffin._\r\n\r\nSince most of the fruit on vines trained by the Four-cane Kniffin\r\nmethod is borne on the two upper canes, some growers in the Hudson\r\nRiver Valley dispense with the lower canes and cut the upper ones long\r\nenough to bear the crop. In this method the trunk is brought to the\r\ntop wire and the head formed as in the Four-cane Kniffin. When the\r\nvines are pruned at the close of the third year, two long canes are\r\nleft at the head of the vine with two renewal spurs. These long canes\r\nare drooped over the upper wire obliquely down to the lower wire to\r\nwhich they are tied just above the last bud, forming an\r\numbrella-shaped top as shown in Fig. 19. The renewals are made as in\r\nthe Four-cane Kniffin. This method reduces the amount of leaf surface\r\nto the minimum, so that care must be taken to insure healthy leaf\r\ngrowth. The amount of fruiting-wood put up is also reduced to the\r\nminimum, so that the yield is low unless good cultivation is provided,\r\nin which case, with some varieties and on some soils, the yield is up\r\nto the average and the crop is first-class as regards size of bunch\r\nand berry, compactness of bunch and maturity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. Umbrella method of training.]\r\n\r\n_The Two-trunk Kniffin._\r\n\r\nThe Two-trunk Kniffin, illustrated in Fig. 20, is another modification\r\nwith the aim of securing greater fruitfulness. This method also\r\nprovides an equal number of buds on both wires. Two trunks are brought\r\nfrom the root, one to the upper, the other to the lower wire. The\r\nfruiting canes are taken off and are disposed of as in the Four-cane\r\nKniffin. The trunks are usually tied together to hold them in place.\r\nThis method is in restricted use in the Hudson River Valley where it\r\nis known under the name given here and as \"Double Kniffin\" and\r\n\"Improved Kniffin.\" In experiments in training grapes at Fredonia, New\r\nYork, under the direction of the New York Experiment Station, this\r\nmethod proves to be one of the poorest in growing Concords. The\r\ngrapes fall short in size of bunch and berry and do not mature as well\r\nas under the other drooping methods of training.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. Two-trunk Kniffin training.]\r\n\r\n_The Y-trunk Kniffin._\r\n\r\nStill another modification of the Kniffin method is one in which a\r\ncrotch or Y is made in the trunk midway between the ground and the\r\nlower wire. The theory on which this method is founded is that sap for\r\nthe lower canes is better supplied than in a straight or continuous\r\ntrunk and that the lower canes thus become as productive as those on\r\nthe upper wire. The theory is probably wrong but is accepted by many\r\nnotwithstanding. The methods of pruning, renewing fruiting-wood and\r\ntying are the same as in the Single-stem Kniffin, except, of course,\r\nthat each stem supports two canes and two spurs. This method was in\r\nsomewhat common use some years ago in parts of western New York but is\r\nnow disappearing.\r\n\r\n_The Munson method._\r\n\r\nAn ingenious modification of the Kniffin principle was devised by\r\nElbert Wakeman, Oyster Bay, Long Island, and afterwards improved and\r\nbrought into prominence by the late T. V. Munson of Denison, Texas; it\r\nis now much used in southern vineyards. The method is described as\r\nfollows by Munson:[14]\r\n\r\n\"The posts should be of some durable strong wood, such as Bois d'Arc\r\n(Osage), Cedar, heartwood of Catalpa, Black Locust or White Oak. The\r\nend posts of every row should be large and strong and be set three and\r\none-half or four feet in the ground and well tamped. The intermediate\r\nposts, which may be much lighter than the end posts, should be six and\r\none-half or seven feet long and set two to two and one-half feet in\r\nthe ground, with twenty-four feet spaces between posts, which will\r\ntake three vines, eight feet apart, or two vines twelve feet apart.\r\nAfter the posts are set, a three-eighths-inch hole should be bored\r\nthrough each post, four feet from the surface of the ground, in the\r\ndirection in which the row runs, leaving six inches or more of post\r\nabove the hole. These holes are for the admittance of the middle,\r\nlower wire of the trellis.\r\n\r\n\"For each end post prepare for cross-arm, a piece of two by four hard\r\npine or oak, two feet long, and at one inch from either end, and one\r\ninch from the upper side, bore a three-eighths of an inch bit-hole, or\r\nsaw into upper side half an inch, which will take less time and do as\r\nwell, to pass the lateral wires through, and in the middle of the\r\nlower side, saw a notch one-half inch deep. For each intermediate\r\npost, prepare a board of similar wood, two feet long, one inch thick\r\nby four broad, and likewise bore or notch.\r\n\r\n\"Through the holes in the posts run a No. 11 galvanized wire, fasten\r\nat one end, tighten at the other end by a wire stretcher and fasten.\r\nThis will be the middle and lower wire of the trellis, and all that\r\nwill be needed the first year, when the young vines are trained up a\r\nstring, tied from the vine (when set) to the wire, and along it. The\r\narms, and the two lateral wires which they bear, need not be put on\r\nthe trellis until after the vines are pruned and tied the next winter.\r\nTo put on the cross-arms, use no bolts or nails, only No. 11\r\ngalvanized wire.\r\n\r\n\"Each end cross-arm is placed inside the post, and against it on top\r\nof the wire, already through the posts, notch-side downward,\r\nstraddling the wire, to keep it from sliding. Then take a piece of\r\nsame size wire, about seven feet long, pass one end through the\r\nbit-hole or saw-notch, in one end of arm and fasten it by looping and\r\ntwisting about six inches of the end back upon itself, then while one\r\nperson holds the cross-arm in place, the operator carries the wire\r\ndown around the post once near the ground, staples it on each side\r\nand brings the other end up to the opposite end of arm, puts it\r\nthrough the bit-hole, or saw-notch, draws it tightly, keeping the arm\r\nlevel, and fastens the end of the wire as was done the other. Wire\r\nnippers and pliers will be needed for this work. Then take another\r\npiece of wire about two feet long, and put it twice around the\r\ncross-arm and the post where they come together, above the middle\r\nwire, and firmly tie them together, crossing the wire as it goes\r\naround. This will hold the arm in place and not weaken or split the\r\narm as do nails and bolts, and will be longer-lasting, quicker and\r\ncheaper, and more elastic, so that when struck by the hames or collar\r\nin cultivation, it gives a little, receiving no damage.\r\n\r\n\"Likewise place the cross-arms on the intermediate posts, leaving the\r\nends of the wire projecting about six inches after fastening, for a\r\npurpose soon to be mentioned. Then draw the two lateral wires through\r\nthe bit-holes in the ends of the arms, or drop into the saw-notches,\r\nif such are made, throughout the row, tighten with the wire stretcher\r\nand fasten. Then return along each lateral wire, wrapping ends of wire\r\nat the ends of the arms very closely and tightly around the\r\nthrough-going lateral wires, as telegraph and telephone wires are\r\nwrapped in splicing. This is quickly done with the proper pliers, and\r\nprevents the arms from slipping out of proper position. Now the\r\ntrellis is complete, and will need little or no repairs, and looks\r\nvery neat, especially if painted.\r\n\r\n\"Pruning and training on the Munson trellis is very simple and easy\r\nwith a little instruction for a few minutes with a vine or two pruned\r\nfor example. The vine the first season is allowed to grow up on to the\r\nmiddle wire by a string around which it is coiled by hand, by going\r\nover the vineyard once or twice until the selected shoot of each vine\r\nis upon the wire, after which it is allowed to ramble at freedom over\r\nthe wires. By getting on to the trellis the first year, one strong\r\nshoot, and allowing no other to grow, a partial crop can be had the\r\nsecond year, without damage, on all but weak growers, like Delaware,\r\nthat should not be allowed to bear until the third year. At the first\r\nregular pruning (all prunings should be done in November or December,\r\nafter leaf fall, and never so late as to cause the vines to bleed),\r\nthe vine should be cut back to two or three buds that have reached the\r\nmiddle wire, if weak growers, if strong, with heavy growth, six or\r\neight buds each, to two arms, one going each way along the lower wire\r\nfrom where the ascending vine first touches the wire. After the vines\r\nare thus pruned, the outer end of each arm is firmly tied to the lower\r\nwire, along which it is gently coiled. These two ties hold the vine\r\nfirmly in place. The buds on the arms push and ascend, passing over\r\nthe lateral wires, clinging thereto with their tendrils, and hang over\r\nlike a beautiful green drapery shading the fruit and body of the vine\r\naccording to its natural habit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XI.--Concord (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\"On the canopy trellis, all the summer pruning required is, to go\r\nthrough the vineyard at or a few days before blooming time, and with a\r\nlight sharp butcher knife, clip off the tips of all advanced shoots to\r\nbe left for bearing, leaving two or three leaves beyond the outer\r\nflower cluster. From the shoots near the crotch, selected for bearing\r\narms the next year, pick the flower clusters, and strip off or rub off\r\nall shoots and buds that start on trunk of vine below crotch. This\r\nlatter is very important, as such shoots, if left, eat up the\r\nnourishment of the land with no return but added work at pruning time.\r\n\r\n\"It will be found that the shoots at the ends of the arms usually\r\nstart first and strongest, and if not clipped back, will not allow the\r\nbuds back toward the crotch to start well, but if clipped, all other\r\ndesirable buds then push.\r\n\r\n\"In about six to ten days after the first clipping, a second one is\r\nusually necessary, especially if the weather is moist and warm, and\r\nthe land rich. The first clipped shoots, as well as those not clipped\r\nthe first time, will need clipping back this time, the end buds on the\r\nfirst clipped having pushed vigorously.\r\n\r\n\"At a second year's pruning and others following, the old arms with\r\nall the bearing shoots on them are cut off down to the new arms and\r\nthe new arms cut back to lengths they can fill with fruit and well\r\nmature. In this, critical judgment and knowledge of capabilities of\r\ndifferent varieties are more required in the pruner than in any other\r\nof the training work. Some varieties, such as the Delaware, cannot\r\ncarry more than three to four arms, two feet long, while Herbemont can\r\nmore easily carry four arms each eight feet long, hence such as\r\nDelaware should be planted eight feet or less apart, while Herbemont\r\nand most of the Post-Oak grape hybrids, should be twelve to sixteen\r\nfeet apart. In other words, each variety should be set that distance\r\napart that it will fill the trellis with fruit from end to end, and\r\nmature it well, so as to better economize space.\r\n\r\n\"By the third year, the vine should come to full bearing, and be\r\npruned with four bearing arms, two to go each way along the lower wire\r\nof trellis, gently coiling around the wire, one arm in one direction,\r\nthe other in opposite direction, and should be in about equal lengths,\r\nso that one firm tie with jute yarn, near the ends, will be all the\r\ntying the vines will need--that is, two ties to each vine--the least\r\nrequired by any trellis system, and the pruning is also simplest and\r\nthe results every way the best.\r\n\r\n\"Some of the advantages of this trellis are its cheapness, its\r\nsimplicity, bringing the work up breast-high so that pruning, tying,\r\nharvesting, spraying, can be done in an erect position, saving back\r\nstrain; perfect distribution of light, heat and air to foliage and\r\nfruit; shielding from sunscald and birds; giving free ventilation and\r\neasy passage of wind through the vineyard without blowing down the\r\ntrellis or tender shoots from the vines, and allowing ready passage\r\nfrom row to row, without going around, thus getting larger and better\r\ncrops at less expense and increasing length of life of vineyard and\r\nthe pleasure of taking care of it.\"\r\n\r\nThis method does not seem to be adapted to the needs of grapes in\r\nnorthern vineyards, and in the South such weak-growing sorts as\r\nDelaware do not thrive when so trained. Several \"modified Munson\r\nmethods\" are in use in the southern states, but those most commonly\r\nemployed do not depart greatly from the method here described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_III. Shoots horizontal_\r\n\r\n_Hudson horizontal._\r\n\r\nThere is now in use but one method of training shoots horizontally. In\r\nthis method the trellis is made by setting posts eight or ten feet\r\napart and connecting them by two slats, one at the top of the posts,\r\nthe other about eighteen inches from the ground. Strands of wire are\r\nstretched perpendicularly between the slats at ten- or twelve-inch\r\nintervals. One cane is trained from a trunk from one to two feet high\r\non the trellis; it rises perpendicularly from the ground and is tied\r\nto the top slat. The shoots push out right and left and are tied\r\nhorizontally to each wire as they reach it. The cane is usually\r\nallowed to bear about six shoots on each side. The grapes set at the\r\nbase of the shoots so that the bunches hang one over the other, making\r\na pretty sight. This method is too expensive for a commercial vineyard\r\nbut is often used in gardens and for ornamental plantings. Only\r\nweak-growing sorts, as Delaware, Iona or Diana are adapted for this\r\nmethod. Delaware does remarkably well under horizontal training. The\r\nuse of slats and wires in horizontal training are often reversed. The\r\nalternative from the method just described is to set posts sixteen or\r\neighteen feet apart upon which are strung two wires as for the\r\nordinary trellis. Perpendicular slats are then fastened to these\r\nwires to which the shoots are tied. Two slats, fifteen inches apart,\r\nare provided on each side of a fruiting cane, which, with the slat for\r\nthe support of the cane, give five to a vine. Or the vine may be\r\nsupported by a stake driven in the ground.\r\n\r\nIn both of these methods, a shoot must be taken out from the head of\r\nthe vine each season for the next season's fruiting-wood. This shoot\r\nis tied to the central wire or slat and is now allowed to fruit. Thus\r\nthe vine starts each spring with a single cane. Grapes are grown under\r\nthese horizontal methods chiefly, if not only, in the Hudson River\r\nValley and even here they are going out of use.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING ON ARBORS, PERGOLAS AND AS ORNAMENTALS\r\n\r\nThe grape is much used to cover arbors, pergolas, lattices and to\r\nscreen the sides of buildings, few climbing plants being more\r\nornamental. Leaf, fruit and vine have been favorite subjects for\r\nreproduction by ornamentalists of all ages. As yet, however, it is\r\nseldom seen in cultivated landscapes except to secure shade and\r\nseclusion.\r\n\r\nGrown for æsthetic purposes, the grape is seldom fruitful, for the\r\nvines can rarely be cultivated or deprived of their luxuriant growth\r\nas in the vineyard. Nevertheless, grapes grown as ornamentals can be\r\ntrained so as to serve the double purpose of ornamental and\r\nfruit-bearing plant. Grown on the sides of a building, the grape often\r\ncan be made to bear large crops of choicely fine fruit. The ancients\r\nhad learned this, for the Psalmist says: \"Thy wife shall be like the\r\nfruitful vine by the sides of thine house.\"\r\n\r\nIn all ornamental plantings on arbors or pergolas, if fruit is to be\r\nconsidered, the permanent trunk is carried to the top of the\r\nstructure. Along this trunk, at intervals of eighteen inches, spurs\r\nare left from which to renew the wood from year to year. The vines\r\nshould stand six or eight feet apart, depending on the variety, and\r\none cane is left, three or four feet long, on each spur when the\r\npruning is done. Shoots springing from these cover intermediate spaces\r\nsoon after growth begins. Provision, of course, must be made for a new\r\ncane each season, and this is done by saving a shoot springing from\r\nspur or trunk at pruning time.\r\n\r\nThe same method of training, with modifications to suit the case, may\r\nbe employed on sides of buildings, walls, fences and lattices. If the\r\nobject to be covered is low, however, and especially if fruit as well\r\nas a covering is wanted, perhaps a better plan is annually to renew\r\nfrom a low trunk or even back to the root. In this low renewal, a new\r\ncane, or two or three if desired, should be brought out each season,\r\nthus securing greater vigor for the vine, but greatly delaying,\r\nespecially in the case of high walls, the production of a screen of\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRUNING AND TRAINING MUSCADINE GRAPES\r\n\r\nThe Muscadine grapes of the South are so distinct in characters of\r\ngrowth and fruit-bearing that their requirements as to pruning and\r\ntraining are quite different from the methods so far given. Until\r\nrecent years when these grapes have become of commercial importance,\r\nit was thought by southern vineyardists that the Muscadines needed\r\nlittle or no pruning and some held that pruning injured the vines. Now\r\nit is found that Muscadines respond quite as readily as other types of\r\ngrapes to pruning and training. Husmann and Dearing[15] give following\r\ndirections for pruning Muscadines:\r\n\r\n\"Two systems of training are employed with Muscadine grapes: (1) The\r\nhorizontal or overhead system, by which the growth is spread as an\r\noverhead canopy about 7 feet above the ground and supported by posts;\r\nand (2) the upright or vertical system, in which the growth is spread\r\nover a trellis.\r\n\r\n\"In the overhead system a single trunk is caused to grow erect from\r\nthe ground alongside a permanent post. When the vine has reached the\r\ntop of the post it is pinched in or cut back, so as to make it throw\r\nout shoots to grow and spread out from the head of the vine as the\r\nspokes of a wheel radiate from the hub. (The overhead training of\r\nMuscadines is shown in Fig. 21; upright training, in Fig. 22.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. Rotundifolia vines trained by the overhead\r\nmethod.]\r\n\r\n\"In the upright systems the fruiting arms are either radiated from a\r\nlow vine head, like the ribs of a fan, or they are taken off as\r\nhorizontal arms from a central vertical trunk.\r\n\r\n\"Where the vineyard is not given close personal attention and pruning\r\nand other vineyard practices are neglected the best results will be\r\nobtained with the overhead trellis. Moreover, such a trellis permits\r\ncross-plowing and cultivation and is better adapted for grazing hogs,\r\nsheep, or cattle on cover crops grown in the vineyard. On the other\r\nhand, the careful vineyardist can expect the best and earliest results\r\nfrom vines on the upright or vertical supports. The upright trellis\r\nfacilitates pruning, harvesting, spraying, and intercropping\r\nthroughout the life of the vineyard; it is also easier to repair and\r\ncan be erected from $10 to $20 an acre cheaper than the overhead\r\ntrellis. The use of both the upright system and the overhead trellis\r\nhas netted the growers profitable returns. Each has its advantages and\r\ndisadvantages. The prospective grower, knowing his own conditions,\r\nmust determine which training system is best suited to his conditions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. A Rotundifolia vine trained by the 6-arm\r\nrenewal method.]\r\n\r\n\"During the first year after planting, a strong stake reaching 4 feet\r\nabove the ground at each vine is sufficient support. A trellis should\r\nbe erected the second season, though the upper wires of an upright\r\ntrellis and the secondary wires of an overhead trellis may be added\r\nlater, as the vines need them. In erecting an upright trellis the\r\nposts should be set midway between the vines, the distances apart\r\nvarying with the distances between the plants. The end posts of the\r\nrows should be firmly braced. Three wires are generally used, placed\r\n24, 42, and from 56 to 60 inches from the ground.\r\n\r\n\"In erecting an overhead trellis, the usual method is to place a\r\nsubstantial, durable post reaching 7 feet above the ground at each of\r\nthe permanent vines. Rows of extra heavy, well-braced posts, running\r\nparallel with and also at the ends of the rows of vines, are set at\r\nthe boundaries of the vineyard. There are a number of different ways\r\nof arranging the wires. Usually No. 10 galvanized wires are securely\r\nfastened to the tops of the boundary posts on the four sides of a\r\nvineyard and then are run along and securely fastened on the tops of\r\nthe inside post down each row in both directions as governor wires. As\r\nneeded, No. 14 wires 2 feet apart are run parallel with the governor\r\nwires until in this manner the entire area has been covered.\r\n\r\n\"A cheaper but less durable overhead trellis is made by running No. 9\r\ngovernor wires in only one direction and the secondary wires only at\r\nright angles to the governor wires, the secondary wires being fastened\r\nto the governor wires wherever they cross.\r\n\r\n\"Some growers construct arbors entirely of wood, using slats or poles\r\ninstead of wires.\r\n\r\n\"The pruning of Muscadine grapes during the first three years is\r\nmainly for the purpose of establishing the permanent parts and\r\nadjusting the other parts of the vine to the desired training system\r\nfor future usefulness. After that the pruning is primarily a matter of\r\nrenewing the bearing surface and keeping the vines healthy, vigorous,\r\nand productive.\r\n\r\n\"During the first season the trunk of the vine should be established.\r\nFrom this the main fruiting branches are started the second season.\r\nThese, under favorable circumstances, will bear a small crop of fruit\r\nthe third season. After that the purpose of pruning should be to renew\r\ngrowth, to increase or decrease the bearing surface, and to maintain\r\nthe shape of the vine.\r\n\r\n\"Severe pruning usually removes most of the fruit-bearing wood and\r\nthrows the vine into vigorous wood growth. No pruning, on the other\r\nhand, causes a growth which is too much distributed, weak, and\r\nincapable of bearing good crops. Therefore, the grape grower should\r\nstudy the vines sufficiently to enable him to judge each year the\r\nproper severity of pruning for the best results. This will depend on\r\nthe variety, the age of the vines, the fertility of the soil, etc.\r\nMuscadine grapes bear their fruit in small clusters. It is therefore\r\nnecessary to maintain a large fruiting surface in order to secure a\r\nproper tonnage of fruit. This is accomplished by developing a series\r\nof fruiting arms, spurring along these, and lengthening them as the\r\nvines become stronger. Such fruiting arms can be maintained for a\r\nnumber of years, but after a time it is desirable to renew them. This\r\nis done by cutting out the arm and starting a new one from a cane that\r\nhas been previously grown for such purposes. It is preferable to renew\r\nsystematically only one or, at most, two arms on a vine each year.\r\nThis gradual renewal does not disturb the vigor of the vine, but keeps\r\nit productive, healthy, and strong. The pruning can be quickly and\r\neasily done if systematically practiced from the time the vines are\r\nstarted.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nREJUVENATING OLD VINES\r\n\r\nWhen pruning and training are neglected, a vineyard soon becomes a\r\nsorry company of halt and maimed vines. These neglected vines can\r\nrarely be reshaped and restored to their pristine vigor. If the old\r\nvines seem capable of throwing out a strong new growth, it is almost\r\nalways better to grow a new top by taking out canes from the roots and\r\nso rejuvenate. The energy and activity of Nature are seldom seen to\r\nbetter advantage than in these new tops, if the old tops are cut back\r\nseverely and the vineyard given good care. The new canes grow with the\r\ngusto of the biblical bay tree, making it difficult oftentimes to keep\r\nthem within bounds.\r\n\r\nUsually this new top can be treated essentially as if it were a new\r\nvine. Not infrequently the cane will make sufficient growth and mature\r\nwell enough so that it may be left as a permanent trunk at the end of\r\nthe first season. If, however, the wood is short, weak and soft, it\r\nshould be cut back in the autumn to two or three buds from one of\r\nwhich a permanent trunk can be trained the next season from which a\r\ngood top can be formed in another season. The old top is discarded as\r\nsoon as the new trunk is tied to the trellis. Old vineyards are often\r\nrejuvenated in this way to advantage and return profits to their\r\nowners for years; but if the soil is poor and the vines weak, attempts\r\nto renew the tops seldom pay.\r\n\r\nOccasionally rejuvenating old vines by pruning is worth while. When\r\nsuch an attempt is made, it is best to cut back severely at the\r\nwinter-pruning, leaving two, three or four canes, depending on the\r\nmethod of training, of six, eight or ten buds. The amount of wood left\r\nmust depend on the vigor of the plant and the variety. The success of\r\nsuch rejuvenation depends much on selecting suitable places on the old\r\nvine from which to renew the bearing wood. It requires good judgment,\r\nconsiderable skill and much experience to rejuvenate successfully an\r\nold vineyard by remodeling the existing top, and if the vines are far\r\ngone with neglect it is seldom worth while.\r\n\r\nSometimes old vines or even a whole vineyard can be rejuvenated most\r\neasily by grafting. This is particularly true when the vines are not\r\nof the kind wanted, and when the vineyard contains an occasional stray\r\nvine from the variety to which it is planted. Directions for grafting\r\nare given on pages 45 to 50. The grafted vine is readily brought into\r\nshape, under any of the several methods of training, by treating it as\r\na young vine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XII.--Diana (×3/5).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nGRAPE-PRUNING ON THE PACIFIC SLOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods of pruning and training native grapes, discussed in the\r\nlast two chapters, do not apply to the Vinifera grapes grown in the\r\nfavored valleys of the Rocky Mountains and on the Pacific slope. As we\r\nhave already seen, the Vinifera or Old World grape differs markedly in\r\nhabits of growth from the American species so that it would not be\r\nexpected that pruning which applies to the one would apply to the\r\nother types. The fundamentals, to be sure, are much the same and the\r\ndifferent species of grapes are about equally subservient to the\r\nshears of the pruner, but while pruning to regulate fruit-bearing\r\nfinds many similarities in Old and New World grapes, the training of\r\nthe vines is radically different.\r\n\r\nEuropean practices in pruning and training Vinifera grapes are so many\r\nand so diverse that the first growers of this fruit in America were at\r\na loss to know how to prune their vines. But, out of a half century of\r\nexperience, American growers of Old World grapes have adapted from\r\nEuropean practices and have devised to meet new conditions, methods\r\nwhich serve very well in the new home for this old grape. Since the\r\nculture of the Old World grape is centered in California, almost\r\nconfined to that state, California practice may be taken as a pattern\r\nin pruning and training the vines of this species.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINE PRUNING IN CALIFORNIA[16]\r\n\r\nThe systems of pruning in use in California may be divided into two\r\nclasses according to the arrangement of the arms on the trunk of the\r\nvine. In the commonest systems, there is a definite head to the trunk,\r\nfrom which all the arms arise symmetrically at nearly the same level.\r\nThe vines of these systems may be called \"headed vines.\" In the other\r\nsystems, the trunk is elongated four to eight feet and the arms are\r\ndistributed regularly along the whole or the greater portion of its\r\nlength. The vines of these systems, owing to the rope-like form of the\r\ntrunks, are called \"cordons.\"\r\n\r\nThe headed vines are divided according to the length of the vertical\r\ntrunk into high, 2-3 feet, medium, 1-1-1/2 feet, and low, 0-6 inches.\r\nThe cordons may be vertical or horizontal, according to the direction\r\nof the trunk, which is from four to eight feet long. The horizontal\r\ncordons may be single (unilateral) or composed of two branches\r\nextending in opposite directions (bilateral). Double and even multiple\r\nvertical cordons occur, but they are very inadvisable and have no\r\nadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the arms of a headed vine may be symmetrical in all\r\ndirections at an angle of about 45 degrees. Such a vine is said to be\r\n\"vase-formed,\" though the hollow center which this term implies is not\r\nessential. This is the form used in the great majority of our\r\nvineyards whether of wine, raisin, or shipping grapes. It is suitable\r\nfor the \"square\" system of planting and cross cultivation. Where vines\r\nare planted in the avenue system, particularly when trellised and\r\nwhere cross cultivation is impossible, the arms are given a\r\n\"fan-shaped\" arrangement in a vertical plane. This arrangement is\r\nconsidered to be essential for the economical and easy working of\r\ntrellised vines.\r\n\r\nOn the vertical or upright cordon, the arms are arranged at as regular\r\nintervals as possible on all sides of the trunk from the top to within\r\ntwelve or fifteen inches of the bottom. On the horizontal cordon the\r\narms are arranged similarly, but as nearly as possible on the upper\r\nside of the trunk only.\r\n\r\nEach of these systems may again be divided into two subsystems,\r\naccording to the management of the annual growth or canes. In one,\r\nspurs of one, two, or three eyes are left for fruit production. This\r\nsystem is called short or spur pruning. In the other, long canes are\r\nleft for fruit production. This is called long or cane pruning. In\r\nrare cases an intermediate form is adopted in which long spurs or\r\nshort canes of five or six eyes are left. In cane pruning, each fruit\r\ncane is accompanied by one or two short renewal spurs. These must also\r\naccompany half-long pruning. Systems of pruning, when only long canes\r\nare left without renewal-spurs, are not in use in California. In all\r\nsystems, replacing-spurs are left wherever and whenever needed.\r\n\r\nOther modifications are introduced by the manner of disposal of the\r\nfruit canes. These may be tied up vertically to a stake driven at the\r\nfoot of each vine or bowed in a circle and tied to this same stake, or\r\nthey may be tied laterally to wires stretching along the rows in a\r\nhorizontal, ascending or descending direction.\r\n\r\nThe different systems differ therefore in: (1) the shape, length, and\r\ndirection of the trunk; (2) the arrangement of the arms; (3) the use\r\nof fruit spurs or fruit canes with renewal spurs; (4) the disposal of\r\nthe fruit canes.\r\n\r\nThe principal possibilities of the pruning are shown in the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n\r\nA. HEAD PRUNING: VASE-FORM\r\n\r\n                      }        { (_a_) Fruit spurs or\r\n                      }        {\r\n    1.

High trunk: Fruit canes and renewal spurs; canes descending.\r\n\r\n2. Medium trunk: Fruit canes and renewal spurs; canes horizontal or\r\nascending.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. CORDON PRUNING\r\n\r\n1. Vertical: Spur; half-long; cane.\r\n\r\n2. Horizontal-unilateral: Spur; half-long; cane.\r\n\r\n3. Horizontal-bilateral: Spur; half-long; cane.\r\n\r\nAll possible combinations indicated by this table represent 24\r\nvariations. Some of these combinations, however, are not used and some\r\nare rare. The most common are shown in Figs. 23, 24, 25, 26 and 27.\r\n\r\nFigure 23 B represents a headed, vase-formed vine, with a medium trunk\r\nand short fruit spurs. This is the most common system used in all\r\nparts of California and is suited for all small growing vines which\r\nbear on the lower buds, for most wine grapes and for Muscats. The unit\r\nof pruning in this case is a fruit spur of 1, 2, or 3 internodes,\r\naccording to the vigor of the variety and of the individual cane.\r\n\r\nFigure 23 A differs from 23 B only in the higher trunk and longer\r\narms. It is commonly used for Tokay and other large growing\r\nvarieties, especially when growing in rich soil and when planted far\r\napart.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23. Forms of head pruning: _A_, spur pruning with\r\nhigh trunk; _B_, spur pruning with medium trunk; _C_, half-long with\r\nmedium trunk.]\r\n\r\nFigure 23 C has the same form of body as A and B, except that the arms\r\nare somewhat less numerous. The unit of pruning is a short fruit cane\r\nof four to five internodes, accompanied by a renewal spur of one\r\ninternode. It is suited for vigorous table grapes, which do not bear\r\nwell on short spurs. It is used especially for the Cornichon and\r\nMalaga in rich soil. This is a difficult system to keep in good shape\r\nowing to the tendency for all the vigor to go to the growth on the\r\nends of the fruit canes. It is difficult to obtain vigorous canes on\r\nthe renewal spurs. Occasional short pruning is usually necessary to\r\nkeep the vines in proper shape.\r\n\r\nFigure 24 A is similar to 23 C in form, but the number of arms is\r\nstill further reduced to 2, 3, or at most 4. The unit of pruning is a\r\nfruit cane of 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 feet with its renewal spur. Owing to the\r\nlength of the fruit canes they require support and are tied to a high\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nThis method is used in a large number of vineyards with Sultanina,\r\nSultana and certain wine grapes, especially Semillon and Cabernet. It\r\nis not to be recommended in any case, as it has several very serious\r\ndefects.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of obtaining new wood from the renewal spurs is even\r\ngreater than in the system shown in Fig. 23 C. The length and vertical\r\nposition of the fruit canes cause the main growth and vigor of the\r\nvine to be expended on the highest shoots. The renewal spurs are thus\r\nso shaded that, even though their buds start, the shoots make but a\r\nweak growth. The result is that at the following pruning all the good\r\nnew wood is at the top of the fruit canes of the previous year, where\r\nit cannot be utilized. The pruner has to choose then between reverting\r\nto spur pruning and getting no crop or using the weak growth from the\r\nrenewal spurs for fruit canes, in which case he may get blossoms but\r\nlittle or no fruit of any value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24. Forms of head pruning: _A_, vertical fruit\r\ncanes and renewal spurs; _B_, bowed fruit canes and renewal spurs.]\r\n\r\nOther defects of this method are that the fruiting shoots are\r\nexcessively vigorous and therefore often tend to drop their blossoms\r\nwithout setting and the fruit when produced is massed together so that\r\nit ripens unevenly and is difficult to gather. It also requires a tall\r\nand expensive stake.\r\n\r\nFigure 24 B represents an improvement on the last system. It differs\r\nonly in the method of treating the fruit canes. These are bent over\r\nin the form of a circle and tied by their middle part to a stake which\r\nmay be smaller and lower than that needed for the vertical canes.\r\n\r\nThis bowing of the canes has several useful effects. The change of\r\ndirection moderates the tendency of the vigor of the vine to expend\r\nitself only on the terminal shoots. More shoots therefore are formed\r\non the fruit canes and as their vigor is somewhat decreased they tend\r\nto be more fruitful. The slight mechanical injury caused by the\r\nbending operates in the same direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25. Head pruning: fan-shaped head; fruit canes\r\ntied to horizontal trellis.]\r\n\r\nThe excess of vigor thus being diverted from the fruit canes causes\r\nthe renewal spurs to form vigorous shoots, which soon grow above the\r\nfruit shoots and obtain the light and air they need for their proper\r\ndevelopment. This method is used successfully for certain wine grapes\r\nsuch as Riesling, Cabernet, and Semillon. It is unsuited to large\r\nvigorous varieties or for vines on rich soil planted wide apart. In\r\nthese cases two fruit canes are usually insufficient and, if more are\r\nused, the grapes and leaves are so massed together that they are\r\nsubject to mildew and do not ripen evenly or well. The bowing and\r\ntying of the canes requires considerable skill and care on the part of\r\nthe workmen.\r\n\r\nThe body, arms, and annual pruning of the system shown in Fig. 25 are\r\nsimilar to those of Fig. 24, with the exception that the arms are\r\ngiven a fan-shaped arrangement in one plane. It differs in the\r\ndisposal of the fruit canes, which are supported by a trellis\r\nstretching along the row from vine to vine.\r\n\r\nThis method is largely used for the Sultanina (Thompson's Seedless),\r\nand is the best system for vigorous vines which require long pruning,\r\nwherever it is possible to dispense with cross cultivation. It is also\r\nsuitable for any long-pruned varieties when growing in very fertile\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nFigure 26 is a photograph of a four-year-old Emperor vine,\r\nillustrating the vertical cordon system. It consists of an upright\r\ntrunk 4-1/2 feet high with short arms and fruit spurs scattered evenly\r\nand symmetrically from the top to within fifteen inches of the bottom.\r\nThis system is used in many Emperor vineyards in the San Joaquin\r\nValley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26. Single vertical cordon with fruit spurs.]\r\n\r\nIts advantages are that it allows the large development of the vine\r\nand the large number of spurs which the vigor of the Emperor demands,\r\nwithout, on the one hand, crowding the fruit by the proximity of the\r\nspurs or, on the other hand, spreading the vine so much that\r\ncultivation is interfered with. It also permits cross cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of its defects is that the fruit is subjected to various degrees\r\nof temperature and shading in different parts of the vine and the\r\nripening and coloring are often uneven. A more vital defect is that it\r\ncannot be maintained permanently. The arms and spurs at the top of\r\nthe trunk tend to absorb the energies of the vine and the lower arms\r\nand spurs become weaker each year until finally no growth at all is\r\nobtained below. After several years, most of the vines therefore lose\r\ntheir character of cordons and become simply headed-vines with\r\nabnormally long trunks.\r\n\r\nThe cordon can be reëstablished in this case by allowing a vigorous\r\nsucker to develop one year from which to form a new trunk the next.\r\nThe following year the old trunk is removed entirely. An objection to\r\nthis method is that it makes very large wounds in the most vital part\r\nof the vine--the base of the trunk.\r\n\r\nFigure 27 is a photograph of a four-year-old Colombar vine,\r\nillustrating the unilateral, horizontal cordon system. It consists of\r\na trunk about seven feet long, supported horizontally by a wire two\r\nfeet from the ground. Arms and spurs are arranged along the whole\r\nhorizontal part of the trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27. Unilateral horizontal cordon with fruit\r\nspurs.]\r\n\r\nThis system accomplishes the same objects as the vertical cordon. It\r\nallows a large development of the vine and numerous fruit spurs\r\nwithout crowding. It is superior to the vertical cordon in the\r\ndistribution of the fruit, which is all exposed to approximately the\r\nsame conditions owing to the uniform distance from the ground of the\r\nfruit spurs. All parts of the trunk producing an annual growth of wood\r\nand fruit are equally exposed to light and the tendency of the growth\r\nto occur principally at the part of the trunk farthest removed from\r\nthe root is counteracted by the horizontal position. There is not the\r\nsame difficulty therefore in maintaining this form of vine permanently\r\nthat there is with the vertical cordon.\r\n\r\nThis system should not be used for small weak vines, whether the\r\nweakness is a characteristic of the variety or due to the nature of\r\nthe soil. It is suited only to very vigorous varieties such as\r\nEmperor, Almeria, and the Persian grapes when growing far apart in\r\nrich, moist soil.\r\n\r\n_Periods of development._\r\n\r\nThe first year in the life of a vine is devoted to developing a\r\nvigorous root system; the next two or three years to building up a\r\nshapely trunk and head, and a like period to forming the full\r\ncomplement of arms. At the end of from five to nine years the\r\nframework of the vine is complete and should undergo no particular\r\nchange of shape except a gradual thickening of trunk and arms.\r\n\r\nThere are, therefore, several periods in the life of the vine with\r\nvarying objects, and the methods of pruning must vary accordingly.\r\nThese periods do not correspond exactly to periods of time, so it may\r\nbe misleading to speak of pruning a two-year-old or a three-year-old\r\nvine. One vine under certain conditions will reach the same stage of\r\ndevelopment in two years that another will reach only in three or four\r\nyears under other conditions. The range of time of these periods is\r\nabout as follows:\r\n\r\n    First period--Formation of a strong root system   1 to 2 years\r\n    Second period--Formation of stem or trunk              1 year\r\n    Third period--Formation of head                   2 to 3 years\r\n    Fourth period--Complete development of the arms   2 to 3 years\r\n      Total time of formation of framework            6 to 9 years\r\n\r\nUnder exceptionally favorable conditions the first and second periods\r\nmay be included in the first year and a completely formed vine may be\r\nobtained in five years.\r\n\r\n_Before planting._\r\n\r\nFor planting, cuttings, one-year-old rooted vines, or bench grafts are\r\nused. In all cases, they need some attention from the pruner.\r\n\r\nThe usual way to prune a good rooted vine of average size having a\r\nsingle cane at the top and several good roots at the bottom is to\r\nshorten the cane to one or two buds and the roots to two or four\r\ninches, according to their size. Shortening the cane makes the vine\r\nless liable to dry out before rooting and forces the growth from the\r\nlower buds which produce more vigorous shoots. The roots are shortened\r\nso that there will be no danger of the ends being turned upwards when\r\nplanted. If they are to be planted in a large hole, they may be left\r\nas long as five or six inches; if to be planted with a crowbar or\r\ndibble, they must be cut back to half an inch.\r\n\r\nIf the rooted vine has several canes, all but one should be removed\r\nentirely, and this one shortened to one or two eyes. The one left\r\nshould be that which is strongest, has the best buds, and is the best\r\nplaced. Where a horizontal cane is left, it should be cut back to the\r\nbase bud. Otherwise the main growth may occur at a higher bud and the\r\nvine will have a crook which will result in a badly formed trunk.\r\n\r\nIf canes are growing from different joints, it is usually best to\r\nleave the lower cane if they are equally vigorous. This brings the\r\nbuds from which growth will come nearer to the roots, and leaves less\r\nof the original cutting, which are advantages. The upper joint between\r\nthe canes is, moreover, often more or less decayed or imperfect.\r\n\r\n_First growing season._\r\n\r\nThe treatment during the first spring and summer will depend on what\r\ngrowth the vines are expected to make and on whether the vines are\r\nstaked the first year.\r\n\r\nWith cuttings and with both rooted vines and grafts where the growth\r\nwill be moderate, staking the first year is unnecessary, though it has\r\nsome slight advantages. In these cases, no pruning of any kind is\r\nnecessary until the winter following the planting, except in the case\r\nof bench grafts. The pruning in the last case is confined to the\r\nremoval of the suckers from the stock and roots from the cion. If the\r\nstocks have been well disbudded by the nurseryman, few suckers will\r\ndevelop. In moist soil, the cion roots may develop vigorously and must\r\nbe removed before they grow too large, or they may prevent the proper\r\ndevelopment of the resistant roots.\r\n\r\nThe removal of roots should usually be done some time in July. For\r\nthis purpose the hill of soil is scraped away from the union and after\r\nthe cion roots and suckers are removed it is replaced. In this second\r\nhilling up, the union should be just barely covered so that the soil\r\nround the union will be dry and unfavorable to a second growth of\r\nroots. Later in the season, about September, the soil should be\r\nremoved entirely from around the union and any new roots that may have\r\nformed removed. The union is then left exposed to harden and mature,\r\nso that it will pass the winter without injury.\r\n\r\n_First winter pruning._\r\n\r\nAt the end of the first growing season, an average good vine will have\r\nproduced from three to five canes, the longest of which will be from\r\ntwo to three feet long.\r\n\r\nSoon after the leaves have fallen in December or early in January the\r\nvines should be pruned. The method is precisely similar to that used\r\nfor rooted vines before planting except that the main roots are not\r\ntouched. All the canes are removed entirely except one. This one\r\nshould be well matured, at least at the base, and should have\r\nwell-formed eyes. It is shortened to two eyes. It is well also to cut\r\noff all shallow roots within three or four inches of the surface. This\r\nis necessary in the case of grafted vines if any have escaped the\r\nsummer root-cutting.\r\n\r\nSome of the vines may have made an exceptionally large growth. Such\r\nvines may sometimes possess a cane large enough from which to start\r\nthe trunk in the way described later for the second winter pruning.\r\n\r\n_Staking._\r\n\r\nIf the vines have not been staked before, the stakes should be driven\r\nsoon after pruning and before the starting of the buds.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve the alignment of the vineyard, the stakes should\r\nbe driven on the same side of every vine at a uniform distance. The\r\nbest distance is about two inches. If driven closer they may injure\r\nlarge roots or even the main underground stem if the vines have not\r\nbeen carefully planted vertically or slanting towards the side on\r\nwhich the stake is to be placed.\r\n\r\nThe side on which the stake should be placed depends on the direction\r\nof the prevailing winds during the growing season. This side is the\r\nleeward. That is, the stake should be so placed that the wind will\r\npress the vine towards the stake instead of away from it. This will\r\nmuch facilitate the work of keeping the vine upright and attached to\r\nthe stake. If the vine is on the other side the pressure of the wind\r\nwill stretch the string tight and the swaying of the vine will\r\ngradually wear the string until it breaks, necessitating retying. By\r\ncarefully observing this rule, very few vines will require retying\r\neven if weak material like binding twine is used.\r\n\r\n_Second summer pruning._\r\n\r\nBefore the starting of the buds, in the spring following the planting,\r\nmost of the vines appear about the same as when they were planted.\r\nThere is, however, a very notable difference, in that they have\r\nwell-developed root systems in the soil where they were formed. The\r\nresult is that they make a much more prompt and early start and will\r\nproduce a much larger growth than they did the first season. For this\r\nreason they require very careful attention from the pruner during the\r\nspring and summer of the second season. Vines neglected at this time,\r\nin this respect, may make as large a growth, but a large part of it\r\nwill be wasted, the vines will be misformed and it will require from\r\none to two years longer to develop a suitable framework and to bring\r\nthem into bearing, even though they are properly handled during\r\nsubsequent years. The more vigorous the vines, the more necessary it\r\nis to handle them properly during this period.\r\n\r\nThe main object during this second growing season is to develop a\r\nsingle, strong, vigorous and well-ripened cane from which to form the\r\npermanent trunk of the vine.\r\n\r\nThis is done by concentrating all the energies of the vine into the\r\ngrowth of a single shoot. As soon as the buds start, or when the most\r\nprecocious has developed a shoot of a few inches in length, the vines\r\nshould be disbudded. This consists in rubbing off with the hand all\r\nbuds and shoots except the two largest and best placed. The lowest,\r\nupright shoots are usually the best. Leave only those which will make\r\na straight vine. It is better to leave less developed buds than a\r\nshoot which, when it grows, will make an awkward crook with the\r\nunderground stem.\r\n\r\nAfter this disbudding, the two shoots left will grow rapidly, as they\r\nreceive all the energies of the root system. When the longest have\r\ngrown from ten to fifteen inches, they should be tied to the stake.\r\nUnless this is done, they are liable to be broken off by any heavy\r\nwind, owing to their soft, succulent texture. Only the best placed and\r\nmost vigorous of the two shoots should be tied up. If this shoot is\r\ngrowing upright and near the stake, this can be done without any\r\ndanger of injuring it. In this case the second shoot should be\r\nremoved. If the shoot has to be bent over in tying it to the stake it\r\nmay be injured. In such a case the second shoot should be allowed to\r\ngrow until it is known whether the first has been injured. In case of\r\ninjury the second shoot can be tied up the next time the vines are\r\nvisited and the injured shoot removed.\r\n\r\nAt the tying up of the reserved shoots, all new shoots which have\r\ndeveloped since the first disbudding should be removed. The shoots\r\nshould be tied up loosely, as they are soft and easily injured, and\r\nthey should be brought around carefully to the windward side of the\r\nstake.\r\n\r\nThe shoots will require tying once more when they have grown another\r\nfoot or eighteen inches. There will then be two ties, one at two or\r\nthree inches from the top of the stake and the other at about the\r\nmiddle. If the vines have a tall stake and are to be headed very high,\r\nanother tying higher up may be needed later.\r\n\r\nWith vines making only a moderate growth, no other pruning will be\r\nneeded until the winter. Exceptionally vigorous vines, however, may\r\nmake a cane eight, ten or more feet long. Such a cane is heavy and is\r\nvery likely to break the ropes by which it is attached to the stake.\r\nIn this case it may break off at the bottom, or at least will form an\r\nawkward crook near the ground when it matures. In either case it is\r\ndifficult to form a good trunk the following year. Even when the ties\r\ndo not break, the cane will not be well suited for the commencement of\r\na trunk, as the joints will be so long that it will be impossible to\r\nleave enough well-placed buds at the winter pruning.\r\n\r\nBoth these difficulties are avoided by timely topping. When such\r\nvigorously growing canes have grown twelve or eighteen inches above\r\nthe top of the stake they are cut back about level with the stake.\r\nThis is most conveniently done with a long-bladed knife or piece of\r\nsplit bamboo. After topping, the cane ceases to grow in length and\r\nlaterals start at most of the joints. It is less exposed to the\r\naction of the wind, and the laterals supply the buds needed for\r\nforming the vine at the winter pruning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIII.--Dutchess (×2/3).]\r\n\r\nThe result of the second season's growth, then, has been to produce a\r\nsingle vigorous cane with or without laterals. This is the cane which\r\nis to develop into the final and permanent trunk of the vine. It must\r\nnot only be large and vigorous, but must be properly matured. If the\r\nvine is allowed to grow too late in the season, an early frost may\r\ndestroy the unmatured cane, and much of the results of the year's\r\ngrowth will be wasted. Such a frost may indeed kill the entire vine.\r\nGrafted vines are particularly liable to injury from this cause, as if\r\nthey are killed down to the union they are completely ruined.\r\nUngrafted vines when killed to the ground may be renewed from a sucker\r\nnext year. This sucker, however, is likely to grow with such vigor\r\nthat it is even more liable to injury from an autumn frost than the\r\noriginal shoot.\r\n\r\nThis late growth is much more likely to occur with young vines than\r\nwith old. The old vines stop growing earlier because their energies\r\nare directed into the crop, and as they produce a larger amount of\r\nfoliage they draw more upon the moisture of the soil, which therefore\r\ndries out earlier.\r\n\r\nLate growth of the young vines must be prevented and the wood matured\r\nbefore frost if possible. This is accomplished by means which promote\r\nthe drying of the soil in autumn. Late irrigations should be avoided.\r\nCultivation should usually stop by midsummer. In very moist, rich\r\nsoils, it is often an advantage to grow corn, sunflowers or similar\r\ncrops between the rows of vines to take off the surplus moisture. In\r\nsome cases it is good practice to let the summer weeds grow for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\n_Second winter pruning._\r\n\r\nWith vines which have been treated as described and to which no\r\naccident has happened, the second winter pruning is very simple. It\r\nconsists simply in cutting back the single cane which has been allowed\r\nto grow to the height at which it is desired to head the vine.\r\n\r\nThe vine so pruned consists of a single cane which with the older wood\r\nat the base reaches nearly to the top of the stake, or fifteen inches.\r\nThis if properly treated will develop into a vine with a trunk of\r\nabout twelve inches, though this length can be modified slightly, as\r\nwill be explained later.\r\n\r\nThis cane consists of about seven or eight joints or internodes, with\r\nan equal number of well-formed eyes and an indefinite number of\r\ndormant buds, principally near the base of the cane or junction of the\r\none- and two-year-old wood. Only the buds on the upper half of this\r\ncane will be allowed to grow. These buds--about four--should give six\r\nto eight bunches of grapes and four, six, or eight shoots from which\r\nto form the spurs at the following winter pruning.\r\n\r\nWith a vine which has been cut back to form a high head, the cane is\r\nabout twenty-four inches long and can be used to form a trunk eighteen\r\ninches high, though this height can be modified as in the last case.\r\nAs with the shorter cane, only the buds on the upper half will be\r\nallowed to produce shoots. These--about six--should give ten to twelve\r\nbunches and the shoots necessary for the formation of spurs.\r\n\r\nIn all cases a full internode has been left above the top bud. This is\r\ndone by cutting through the first bud above the highest which it is\r\ndesired to have grow. This cut is made in such a way as to destroy the\r\nbud but to leave the diaphragm intact and part of the swelling of the\r\nnode. This upper internode is left partly to protect the upper bud,\r\nbut principally to facilitate tying. By making a half-hitch around\r\nthis internode, the vine is held very firmly. If the swelling at the\r\nnode of the destroyed bud is not left, many vines will be pulled out\r\nof the hitch when they become heavy with leaves and supple with the\r\nflow of sap in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn tying the vines, no turns or hitches must be made around any part\r\nexcept this upper internode. A hitch below the top bud will result in\r\na crook-necked vine, as the top will bend over in the summer under the\r\nweight of the foliage. A hitch lower down is even more harmful, as it\r\nwill girdle and strangle the vine.\r\n\r\nA second tie about half way from the upper to the ground is always\r\nnecessary to straighten the cane. Even if the cane is straight when\r\npruned, a second tie is needed to keep it from curving under the\r\npressure of leaves and wind in the spring. For high-headed vines three\r\nties are usually necessary.\r\n\r\nFor the top tie, wire is particularly suitable. It holds better than\r\ntwine and does not wear. Even though it is not removed, it does no\r\nharm, as the part around which it is wound does not grow. The lower\r\nties should be of softer material, as wire has a tendency to cut into\r\nthe wood. They should be placed so that the cane is able to expand as\r\nit grows. With thin and especially with round stakes this means that\r\nthe tie must be loose. With large, square stakes there is usually\r\nsufficient room for expansion, even when the twine is tied tight.\r\n\r\n_Third summer pruning._\r\n\r\nDuring the third season, average well-grown vines will produce their\r\nfirst considerable crop and develop the canes from which will be\r\nformed the first arms.\r\n\r\nSuch a vine, soon after the starting of the buds in spring, will have\r\none vigorous shoot about three inches long grown from the old wood and\r\nfive fruit buds started above on the cane. All the buds and shoots\r\nbelow the middle of the cane should be removed.\r\n\r\nThis will leave the four or five fruit buds and will give the vine the\r\nopportunity to produce eight or ten bunches of grapes. These buds will\r\nproduce also at least four or five shoots. If the vine is very\r\nvigorous and the season favorable, they may produce eight, ten or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nWhen the five shoots grow, the height of the head will be determined\r\nat the next winter pruning by which of the corresponding canes are\r\nleft as spurs. If the highest two canes are cut back to spurs and all\r\nothers removed, the vine will be headed as high as possible, as these\r\ntwo spurs form the two first arms which determine the length of the\r\ntrunk. If the lowest two canes are chosen and all of the vine above\r\nthem removed, the trunk will be made as low as possible. Intermediate\r\nheights can be obtained by using some other two adjacent canes and\r\nremoving the rest. It is often advisable to leave some extra spurs\r\nlower than it is desired to head the vine and to remove these lower\r\nspurs the following winter after they have borne a crop. For example,\r\nthe three or four upper canes might be left, if the vine is vigorous\r\nenough, and the lowest one or two of these removed at the next\r\npruning. This, however, is not often necessary with properly handled\r\nvines and is objectionable because it makes large wounds in the trunk.\r\n\r\n_Third winter pruning._\r\n\r\nAt the end of the third season's growth the vine should have a\r\nstraight, well-developed trunk with a number of vigorous canes near\r\nthe top from which to form the arms.\r\n\r\nFigure 28 represents a well-grown vine at this period. No shoots have\r\nbeen allowed to grow on the lower part of the trunk and the five buds\r\nallowed to grow above have produced nine vigorous canes. The pruner\r\nshould leave enough spurs to supply all the fruit buds that the vine\r\ncan utilize. The number, size and thickness of the canes show that the\r\nvine is very vigorous and can support a large crop. It will depend\r\nsomewhat on the variety how many buds should be left. For a variety\r\nwhose bunches average one pound, and which produces two bunches to the\r\nshoot, twelve fruit buds should give about twenty-four pounds, or\r\nabout seven tons per acre, if the vines are planted 12 by 6 feet, as\r\nthese were. The number of spurs will depend on their length. Six spurs\r\nof two buds each will give the required number, but as some of these\r\ncanes are exceptionally vigorous they should be left a little longer,\r\nin which case a smaller number of spurs will suffice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28. Three-year-old vine ready for pruning.]\r\n\r\nWhen the number and length of the spurs are decided on, the canes\r\nshould be chosen which will leave these spurs in the most suitable\r\nposition for forming arms. This position will depend on whether we\r\nwant a vase-form or fan-shaped vine. In the first case, we choose\r\nthose which will distribute the spurs most evenly and symmetrically on\r\nall sides, avoiding any which cross or point downwards.\r\n\r\nIn the second case, we choose only those canes which run in the\r\ndirection of the trellis, avoiding canes which stick out between the\r\nrows. Downward pointing canes may be used in this case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29. Vine of Fig. 28 after pruning for vase-formed\r\nhead.]\r\n\r\nFigure 29 shows the vine after pruning for a vase-formed head. The\r\npruner has used two of the strongest canes to form two three-bud\r\nspurs and three of medium vigor to form three two-bud spurs. The head\r\nis of good shape, though some of the spurs are a little too low. One,\r\ntwo, or three of these can be removed at the following winter pruning,\r\nand the permanent arms and head of the vine formed from canes which\r\ndevelop on the two highest spurs. If the vine were too high, the head\r\ncould be developed the next year from the three lowest spurs and the\r\nupper part removed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Three-year-old vines: _A_, pruned for a\r\nvase-formed, and _B_, for a fan-shaped head.]\r\n\r\nFigure 30 shows vines of the same age of practically perfect shape.\r\nLess spurs have been left because the vines were less vigorous. It is\r\neasier to properly shape vines which make only a moderate growth\r\nduring the first three seasons. On the other hand, very vigorous vines\r\ncan finally be brought into practically perfect shape and the somewhat\r\nlarger and more numerous wounds necessary are more easily healed by a\r\nvigorous vine.\r\n\r\n_Pruning after the third winter._\r\n\r\nFor the pruner who understands the pruning of young vines and has\r\nbrought them to approximately the form represented in Figs. 29 and 30,\r\nthe subsequent winter pruning is very simple. It involves, however,\r\none new idea--the distinction between fruit and sterile wood.\r\n\r\nUp to the third winter pruning, this distinction is not necessary;\r\nfirst, because practically all the wood is fruit wood, and second,\r\nbecause the necessity of forming the vine controls the choice of wood.\r\nFrom this time on, however, this distinction must be carefully made.\r\nAt each winter pruning a number of spurs of fruit wood must be left to\r\nproduce the crop to be expected from the size and vigor of the vine.\r\nBesides these fruit spurs, it may be necessary to leave spurs of\r\nsterile wood to permit of increasing the number of fruit spurs the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nThis will be made clear by comparing Figs. 30 A and 31. Figure 30 A\r\nshows a vine at the third winter pruning with two fruit spurs of two\r\nbuds each and one fruit spur of one bud--five fruit buds in all.\r\n\r\nIf these five fruit buds all produce vigorous shoots during the\r\nfollowing summer, they will supply five canes of fruit wood which can\r\nbe used to form five fruit spurs at the following winter pruning,\r\nwhich will be about the normal increase necessary. Some of these fruit\r\nbuds, however, may produce weak shoots or shoots so badly placed that\r\nthey would spoil the shape of the head if used for spurs. Other\r\nshoots, however, will be produced from base, secondary and\r\nadventitious buds which, while less fruitful, can be used to form\r\nspurs for the starting of new arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31. Four-year-old vine pruned for vase-formed\r\nhead.]\r\n\r\nFigure 31 shows a vine after the fourth winter pruning which had\r\ndeveloped from a vine similar to that shown in Fig. 30 A. From the\r\nthree fruit spurs left the previous year four canes have been chosen\r\nfor the fruit spurs of this year. The old spur on the left has\r\nfurnished two new spurs and the two old spurs at the right each one\r\nnew spur. The pruner, judging that the vine is sufficiently vigorous\r\nto stand more wood, has formed two spurs from water sprouts which,\r\nwhile not likely to produce much fruit the first season, will supply\r\nfruit wood for the following year. The result is a very well-shaped\r\nvine with six almost perfectly balanced spurs. These spurs will\r\ndevelop into permanent arms, some of them furnishing finally two or\r\nthree.\r\n\r\nFigure 32 shows a high-headed vine of the same age. It has five spurs,\r\nof which four are fruit spurs and one a spur of sterile wood left to\r\nshape the vine. The two more or less horizontal spurs on the right\r\nwill bear fruit the following autumn and will be removed entirely at\r\nthe following winter pruning, as they are badly placed. The arms of\r\nthe vine will then be developed from the three upright spurs, which\r\nare excellently placed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32. Four-year-old vine pruned for high vase-formed\r\nhead.]\r\n\r\nEach year thereafter the same process must be followed. First, enough\r\nfruit spurs, as well placed as possible, must be left to produce the\r\ncrop. Second, on most vines supplementary spurs of sterile wood must\r\nbe left to supply more arms where they are needed, and finally, when\r\nthe full complement of arms has developed, to supply new arms to\r\nreplace those which have become too long or are otherwise defective.\r\n\r\n_Fan-shaped vines._\r\n\r\nWith headed vines, the treatment up to the third winter is the same\r\nexcept for the variations in the height of the head. At the third\r\nwinter pruning, however, the formation of the head commences, and the\r\npruner determines whether it shall be vase-formed or fan-shaped. The\r\nproduction of a vase-formed head has already been described.\r\n\r\nAt the third winter pruning, the vine should be pruned to two spurs,\r\nas shown in Fig. 30 B. More vigorous vines should _not_ be given more\r\nspurs, as in Figs. 29 and 30 A, but the spurs should be made longer,\r\nwith four, five, or even six eyes in some cases. This is in order to\r\nobtain some fruit, which might not be obtained from long pruning\r\nvarieties by leaving many spurs. With extremely vigorous vines one\r\nfruit cane may be left at this pruning. The wires of the trellis\r\nshould be put up this year, if this has not already been done.\r\n\r\nFig. 33 A and 33 B illustrates the second step in the production of a\r\nfan-shaped head. This form of head is used only for trellised vines\r\nand long-pruned varieties. The formation of the head and the\r\nmanagement of the fruit canes are therefore conveniently discussed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33. _A_, before pruning; _B_, after pruning.]\r\n\r\nBy comparing the pruned vine, Fig. 33 B, with the unpruned, Fig. 33 A,\r\nthe method of pruning will be made clear. The unpruned vine shows two\r\narms, the spurs of the previous year, from one of which have grown\r\nthree vigorous canes and from the other two somewhat less vigorous.\r\nThe pruned vine shows a complete unit, that is, a fruit cane with its\r\naccompanying renewal spur on the vigorous side and a spur for the\r\nproduction of fruit wood for the following year on the other side. If\r\nthe vine had been more vigorous two complete units would have been\r\nleft and one or two extra spurs.\r\n\r\nAs the form of the vine is determined by the renewal spurs, special\r\nattention should be paid to their position. In this case, the middle\r\ncane on one arm and the lower cane on the other have been used for\r\nrenewal spurs. This brings them both to the same height above the\r\nground and determines the place of the permanent arms. The next year\r\neach of these spurs will furnish a fruit cane and one or two renewal\r\nspurs. The arms will thus in two or three years be increased to four,\r\nor, with very large vines, to six. These spurs should be chosen as\r\nnearly as possible in the plane of the trellis, that is, they should\r\nnot project out sideways. Figure 25 shows vines of this kind of full\r\nsize and in full bearing.\r\n\r\nThe fruit canes also should be as nearly as possible in the direction\r\nof the trellis, though this is not so important, as they can be bent\r\nover to the wire when tied up, and in any case they are removed the\r\nnext year.\r\n\r\n_Double-headed vines._\r\n\r\nSome growers attempt to arrange the arms of their vines in two stages,\r\none above the other, forming double-headed or two-crowned vines. The\r\nmethod is applied to both vase-formed and trellised vines. It is open\r\nto the same criticisms as the vertical cordon, the chief of which is\r\nthat it cannot be maintained permanently. The lower head or ring of\r\narms finally becomes weak and fails to produce wood.\r\n\r\nIt is easier to maintain in trellised vineyards and has some\r\nadvantages, the chief of which is that it makes it easier to keep the\r\nvine in the single plane and to prevent arms getting into the\r\ninter-rows. The double trunk is not necessary and is, in fact, a\r\ndisadvantage, as one trunk has a tendency to grow at the expense of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n_Vertical and bowed canes._\r\n\r\nFigure 24 A shows a long-pruned vine in which the fruit canes have\r\nbeen tied vertically to a tall stake. This is a method used commonly\r\nin many vineyards. The unit of pruning is the same as in the method\r\njust described, consisting of a fruit cane and a renewal spur. The\r\nframework of the vine consists of a trunk of medium height, with a\r\nvase-formed head consisting of three or four arms. The defects of this\r\nsystem have been pointed out on page 155.\r\n\r\nIt is used with fair success with seedless Sultanas and with some wine\r\ngrapes such as Colombar, Semillon, Cabernet, and Riesling, in the\r\nhands of skillful pruners. The results with Sultanina are very\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nBy this method, on most of the vines, the fruit canes start from high\r\nup near the middle of the stake, and are therefore too short for the\r\nbest results. The canes which start from low down are in most cases\r\nsuckers, and therefore of little value for fruit bearing.\r\n\r\nFigure 24 B shows a vine with bowed canes. The method of pruning is\r\nexactly the same as in the method just described. The bowing of the\r\ncanes, however, overcomes some of the defects of that method. It is\r\nused regularly in many wine grape vineyards of the cooler regions. It\r\nis unsuited for very vigorous vines in rich soil.\r\n\r\n_Vertical cordons._\r\n\r\nIn head pruning, the treatment of young vines up to the second or\r\nthird winter pruning is identical for all systems. In cordon pruning\r\nthe treatment for the first and second is also the same. That is, the\r\nvine is cut back to two buds near the level of the ground until a cane\r\nsufficiently long to serve for the formation of the trunk is obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the vertical cordon the trunk is three to four feet long instead of\r\none to two, as in head pruning. This makes it necessary to have a\r\nlonger and more vigorous cane to start with. It may require a year\r\nlonger to obtain this. That is to say, at the end of the second\r\nseason's growth many vines will not have a single cane sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to give the necessary three and one-half feet of\r\nwell-ripened wood and properly developed buds. At the second winter\r\npruning, therefore, it will often be necessary to cut the vine back to\r\ntwo buds, as at the first winter pruning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34. Vertical cordon, young vine pruned.]\r\n\r\nFinally, a cane of the required length will be obtained. The vine is\r\nthen formed as already described for the second winter pruning of\r\nheaded vines, except that the cane is left longer. When such a vine is\r\npruned, spurs are left at intervals along the trunk, as shown in Fig.\r\n34. Each of these spurs is a fruit spur and is also the commencement\r\nof an arm. The future treatment of these arms is the same as that of\r\nthe arms in head pruning.\r\n\r\n_Horizontal cordons._\r\n\r\nDuring the first two or three years, vines which are to be given the\r\nform of horizontal cordons are treated exactly as for vertical\r\ncordons, that is, they are pruned back to two buds each winter and the\r\ngrowth forced by disbudding into a single cane during the summer.\r\n\r\nAs soon as a well-ripened cane of the required length is obtained, it\r\nis tied to a wire stretched horizontally along the row at from fifteen\r\nto twenty-four inches from the ground.\r\n\r\nFor this system of pruning, the rows should be twelve to fourteen feet\r\napart and the vines six, seven, or eight feet apart in the rows. As\r\nthe cordon or trunk of each vine should reach the next vine, it will\r\nhave to be six to eight feet long. The best shape is obtained when the\r\ntrunk is all formed one year from a single cane. It is necessary,\r\nhowever, sometimes to take two years for the formation of the trunk.\r\nIn any case, the cane first tied down should reach at least half way\r\nto the next vine. The following year a new cane from the end of this\r\nshould be used to complete the full length of the trunk.\r\n\r\nIn attaching the cane to the wire, it must be bent over in a gentle\r\ncurve and care taken not to break or injure it. The proper form of the\r\nbend is shown in Figs. 27 and 35. Sharp bends should be avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35. Unilateral horizontal cordon with half-long\r\npruning.]\r\n\r\nThe cane should be placed on top of the wire, but should not be\r\ntwisted around it. The end should be tied firmly and the rest of the\r\ncane supported by strings tied loosely in order to avoid girdling when\r\nthe cane grows.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring, most of the buds on a good cane will start.\r\nIf the cane is short jointed, some of the shoots should be removed and\r\nonly those shoots allowed to develop which are conveniently situated\r\nfor permanent arms. If the vines are to be short pruned, the arms\r\nshould be developed every eight to twelve inches from a few inches\r\nbeyond the bend to the extreme end. For long pruning, the arms should\r\nbe farther apart, twelve to twenty inches. Shoots starting from the\r\ntop of the cane and growing vertically upwards are to be preferred.\r\n\r\nAs the shoots develop, the strongest should be pinched repeatedly, if\r\nnecessary. This will tend to force the growth of the weaker shoots and\r\nto equalize the vigor of all. At the end of the season, there should\r\nbe from five to ten canes growing on each cordon of full length. These\r\ncanes are then pruned back to two or three buds, or a little longer\r\nfor long-pruned varieties.\r\n\r\nDuring the following spring and summer, the vines should be carefully\r\nsuckered and unnecessary water sprouts removed. Any shoots coming from\r\nthe lower side of the cordon should be removed early to strengthen the\r\ngrowth in the shoots on the upper side. Such vines are apt to become\r\ndry or decayed on the upper side. At the end of this year, which\r\nshould be the fourth or fifth from planting at the latest, the cordon\r\nwill be fully formed and the final style of pruning can be applied. A\r\nshort-pruned cordon vine is shown in Fig. 27. The arms and spurs are a\r\nlittle too numerous and too close together. If this vine required the\r\nnumber of buds shown it would have been better to have left the fruit\r\nspurs longer and to have left fewer and shorter wood spurs.\r\n\r\nThe upper vine of Fig. 35 shows a cordon pruned half long. This is an\r\nexcellent system for Malaga, Emperor, and Cornichon when growing in\r\nvery fertile soil. It gives the half-long fruit canes, which these\r\nvarieties need to produce good crops. The fruit canes may be attached\r\nto a wire twelve or fifteen inches above the cordon or bent down and\r\ntied to the cordon itself, as in the lower vine of the figure. The\r\nfirst method is the more convenient, but the second is necessary where\r\nthere is difficulty in obtaining satisfactory growth from the renewal\r\nspurs. When the fruit canes are tied down, as indicated in the lower\r\nvine, renewal spurs may not be needed, as vigorous shoots will\r\nusually be obtained from the lower buds of the fruit canes.\r\n\r\n_Choice of a system._\r\n\r\nIn choosing a system, we must consider carefully the characteristics\r\nof the particular variety we are growing. A variety which bears only\r\non the upper buds must be pruned \"long,\" that is, must be given fruit\r\ncanes. It should be noted that many varieties, such as Petite Sirah,\r\nwhich will bear with short pruning when grafted on resistant roots\r\nrequire fruit canes when growing on their own roots. In general,\r\ngrafted vines require shorter pruning than ungrafted. If pruned the\r\nsame, the grafted vines may overbear and quickly exhaust themselves.\r\nThis seems to be the principal reason for the frequent failure of\r\nMuscat vines grafted on resistant stock. The cultural conditions also\r\naffect the vine in this respect. Vines made vigorous by rich soil,\r\nabundant moisture, and thorough cultivation require longer pruning\r\nthan weaker vines of the same variety.\r\n\r\nThe normal size of the bunch is also of importance. This size will\r\nvary from one-quarter of a pound to 2 or 3 pounds. It is difficult to\r\nobtain a full crop from a variety whose bunches are very small without\r\nthe use of fruit canes. Spurs will not furnish enough fruit buds\r\nwithout crowding them inconveniently. On the other hand, some shipping\r\ngrapes may bear larger crops when pruned long, but the bunches and\r\nberries may be too small for the best quality.\r\n\r\nThe possibilities of development vary much with different varieties. A\r\nMission or Flame Tokay may be made to cover a quarter of an acre and\r\ndevelop a trunk four or five feet in circumference. A Zinfandel vine\r\nunder the same conditions would not reach a tenth of this size in the\r\nsame time. Vines in a rich valley soil will grow much larger than on a\r\npoor hillside. The size and shape of the trunk must be modified\r\naccordingly and adapted to the available room or number of vines to\r\nthe acre.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the vine must be such as to protect it as much as\r\npossible from various unfavorable conditions. A variety susceptible to\r\noïdium, like the Carignane, must be pruned so that the fruit and\r\nfoliage are not unduly massed together. Free exposure to light and air\r\nare a great protection in this respect. The same is true for varieties\r\nlike the Muscat, which have a tendency to \"coulure\" if the blossoms\r\nare too moist or shaded. In frosty locations, a high trunk will be a\r\nprotection, as the air is always colder close to the ground.\r\n\r\nThe qualities required in the crop also influence our choice of a\r\npruning system. With wine grapes, even, perfect ripening and full\r\nflavor are desirable. These are obtained best by having the grapes at\r\na uniform height from the ground and as near to it as possible. The\r\nsame qualities are desirable in raisin grapes, with the addition of\r\nlarge size of the berries. With shipping grapes, the size and\r\nperfection of the berries and bunches are the most essential\r\ncharacteristics. The vine, therefore, should be so formed that each\r\nbunch hangs clear, free from injurious contact with canes or soil and\r\nequally exposed to light and air.\r\n\r\nThe maximum returns in crop depend on the early bearing of young\r\nvines, the regularity of bearing of mature vines and the longevity of\r\nthe vineyard. These are insured by careful attention to all the\r\ndetails of pruning, but are possible only when the vines are given a\r\nsuitable form.\r\n\r\nThe running expenses of a vineyard depend in a great measure on the\r\nstyle of pruning adopted. Vines of suitable form are cultivated,\r\npruned and the crop gathered easily and cheaply. This depends also\r\nboth on the form of vine adopted and on care in details.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, therefore, to state for any particular variety or\r\nany particular location the best style of pruning to be adopted. All\r\nthat can be done is to give the general characteristics of the variety\r\nand to indicate how these may be modified by grafting, soil or\r\nclimatic or other conditions.\r\n\r\nThe most important characteristic of the variety in making a choice of\r\na pruning system is whether it normally or usually requires short,\r\nhalf-long, or long pruning. With this idea, the principal grapes grown\r\nin California, together with all those grown at the Experiment Station\r\non which data exist, have been divided into five groups in the\r\nfollowing list:\r\n\r\n1. _Varieties which require long pruning under all\r\nconditions._--Clairette blanche, Corinth white and black, Seedless\r\nSultana, Sultanina white (Thompson's Seedless) and rose.\r\n\r\n2. _Varieties which usually require long pruning._--Bastardo, Boal de\r\nMadeira, Chardonay, Chauché gris and noir, Colombar, Crabbe's Black\r\nBurgundy, Durif, Gamais, Kleinberger, Luglienga, Marsanne, Marzemino,\r\nMerlot, Meunier, Muscadelle de Bordelais, Nebbiolo, Pagadebito,\r\nPeverella, Pinots, Rieslings, Robin noir, Ruländer, Sauvignon blanc,\r\nSemillon, Serine, Petite Sirah, Slancamenca, Steinschiller, Tinta Cao,\r\nTinta Madeira, Trousseau, Verdelho, Petit Verdot, Wälcherisling.\r\n\r\n3. _Varieties which usually require short pruning._--Aleatico,\r\nAligoté, Aspiran, Bakator, Bouschets, Blaue Elbe, Beba, Bonarda,\r\nBarbarossa, Catarattu, Charbono, Chasselas, Freisa, Frontignan,\r\nFurmint, Grand noir, Grosseblaue, Green Hungarian, Malmsey, Mantuo,\r\nMonica, Mission, Moscatello fino, Mourisco branco, Mourisco preto,\r\nNegro amaro, Palomino, Pedro Zumbon, Perruno, Pizzutello di Roma,\r\nBlack Prince, West's White Prolific, Quagliano, Rodites, Rozaki, Tinta\r\nAmarella, Vernaccia bianca, Vernaccia Sarda.\r\n\r\n4. _Varieties which require short pruning under all\r\nconditions._--Aramon, Burger, Chardonay, Chauché gris and noir,\r\nColombar, Crabbe's Black Burgundy, Durif, Black Morocco, Mourastel,\r\nMuscat of Alexander, Napoleon, Picpoule blanc and noir, Flame Tokay,\r\nUgni blanc, Verdal, Zinfandel.\r\n\r\n5. _Varieties of table grapes which usually require half-long or\r\ncordon pruning._--Almeria (Ohanez), Bellino, Bermestia bianca and\r\nviolacea, Cipro nero, Dattier de Beirut, Cornichon, Emperor, Black\r\nFerrara, Malaga, Olivette de Cadenet, Pis-de-Chevre blanc,\r\nSchiradzouli, Zabalkanski.\r\n\r\nThese lists must not be taken as indicating absolutely for all cases\r\nhow these varieties are to be pruned. They simply indicate their\r\nnatural tendencies. Certain methods and conditions tend to make vines\r\nmore fruitful. Where these occur, shorter pruning than is indicated\r\nmay be advisable. On the other hand, other methods and conditions tend\r\nto make the vines vigorous at the expense of fruitfulness. Where these\r\noccur, longer pruning may be advisable.\r\n\r\nThe more usual factors which tend towards _fruitfulness_ are:\r\n\r\nGrafting on resistant vines, especially on certain varieties such as\r\nthose of Riparia and Berlandieri;\r\n\r\nOld age of the vines;\r\n\r\nMechanical or other injuries to any part of the vine;\r\n\r\nLarge development of the trunk, as in the cordon systems.\r\n\r\nThe more usual factors which tend towards _vigor_ at the expense of\r\nfruitfulness are:\r\n\r\nRich soil, especially large amounts of humus and nitrogen;\r\n\r\nYouth of the vines;\r\n\r\nExcessive irrigation or rainfall (within limits).\r\n\r\nIn deciding what system of pruning to adopt, all these factors,\r\ntogether with the nature of the vine and the uses to which the fruit\r\nis to be put, must be considered. It is best when the vineyard is\r\nstarted to err on the side of short pruning. While this may diminish\r\nslightly the first one or two crops, the vines will gain in vigor and\r\nthe loss will be made up in subsequent crops. If the style of pruning\r\nadopted results in excessive vigor of the vines, it should be\r\ngradually changed in the direction of longer pruning with the object\r\nof utilizing this vigor in the production of crop.\r\n\r\nThis change should be gradual, or the risk is run of injuring the\r\nvitality of the vines by one or two excessively heavy crops.\r\nFinally, each year the condition of the individual vine should\r\ndetermine the kind of pruning to be adopted. If the vine appears weak,\r\nfrom whatever cause, it should be pruned shorter or given less spurs\r\nor fruit canes than the year before. On the contrary, if it appears\r\nunnecessarily vigorous, more or longer spurs or fruit canes should be\r\nleft. Every vine should be judged by itself. It is not possible to\r\ngive more than general directions for the pruning of the whole\r\nvineyard. It cannot be well pruned unless the men who do the actual\r\npruning are capable of using sufficient judgment to properly modify\r\ntheir methods for each individual vine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIV.--Eaton (×4/5).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN GRAPES IN EASTERN AMERICA\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, there were many efforts to grow European grapes in\r\nAmerica during the first two centuries in the settlement of the\r\ncountry. The various attempts, some involving individuals, others\r\ncorporations and in early days even colonies, form about the most\r\ninstructive and dramatic episodes in the history of American\r\nagriculture. All endeavors, it will be remembered, were failures, so\r\ndismally and pathetically complete that we are wont to think of the\r\ntwo hundred years from the first settlements in America to the\r\nintroduction of the Isabella, a native grape, as time wasted in futile\r\nculture of a foreign fruit. The early efforts were far from wasted,\r\nhowever, for out of the tribulations of two centuries of grape-growing\r\ncame the domestication of our native grapes, one of the most\r\nremarkable achievements of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe advent of Isabella and Catawba wholly turned the thoughts of\r\nvineyardists from Old World to New World grapes. So completely,\r\nindeed, were viticulturists won by the thousand and more native\r\ngrapes, that for the century which followed no one has planted Old\r\nWorld grapes east of the Rockies, while vineyards of native species\r\nmay be found North and South from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, much new knowledge has come to agriculture, old fallacies\r\nhave received many hard knocks and chains of tradition in which the\r\nculture of plants was bound, have been broken. In no field of\r\nagriculture have workers received greater aid from science than in\r\nviticulture. Particularly is this true of the diseases of the vine.\r\nThe reports of the old experimenters were much the same, \"a sickness\r\ntakes hold of the vines and they die.\" What the sickness was and\r\nwhether there were preventatives or remedies, no one knew a hundred\r\nyears ago. But in the last half century we have learned much about the\r\nills of grapes and now know preventatives or remedies for most of\r\nthem. We know also that the early vine-growers failed, in part at\r\nleast, because they followed empirical European practices. Is it not\r\npossible that with the new knowledge we can now grow European grapes\r\nin eastern America? The New York Agricultural Experiment Station has\r\nput this question to test, with results indicating that European\r\ngrapes may now be grown successfully in eastern America. The following\r\nis an account of the work with this fruit at the New York Station.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN GRAPES AT THE NEW YORK EXPERIMENT STATION[17]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1911, the Station obtained cuttings of 101 varieties\r\nof European grapes from the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nand the University of California. The cuttings obtained were grafted\r\non the roots of a heterogeneous collection of seedlings, five years\r\nset, representing a half dozen species of Vitis. These stocks had\r\nlittle to recommend them except that all were vigorous, well\r\nestablished and all were more immune to phylloxera than the Old World\r\nvarieties. From four to six grafts of each of the hundred varieties\r\nwere made and a stand of 380 vines resulted, the percentage of loss\r\nbeing exceedingly small. The success in grafting was probably due to\r\nthe method used, the value of which had been proved in previous work\r\non the Station grounds. The method of grafting and details of care\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n_Details of care._\r\n\r\nIn grafting, the earth was removed from the plants to a depth of two\r\nor three inches. The vines were sawed squarely off below the surface\r\nof the ground. The stock was then split for a cleft graft. Two cions,\r\nmade as described on page 46, were inserted in each cleft and tied in\r\nplace with waxed string. Wax was not used as it does not stick in\r\ngrafting grapes, because of the bleeding of the stock. After setting\r\nthe cion, the earth was replaced and enough more of it used to cover\r\nstock and cion to prevent evaporation. This method of grafting is\r\navailable to those who have old vineyards. It is so simple that the\r\nveriest tyro can thus graft grapes. Were young plants or cuttings used\r\nas stocks, some method of bench grafting would, of course, be resorted\r\nto.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation and spraying were precisely that given native grapes.\r\nThere has been no coddling of vines. The fungous diseases which helped\r\nto destroy the vineyards and vexed the souls of the old experimenters\r\nwere kept in check by two sprayings with bordeaux mixture; the first\r\napplication was made just after the fruit set, the second when the\r\ngrapes were two-thirds grown. Some years a third spraying with a\r\ntobacco concoction was used to keep thrips in check. Phylloxera was\r\npresent in the vineyard but none of the varieties seemed to suffer\r\nfrom this pest. The stocks used were not those best suited either to\r\nthe vines grafted on them or to resist phylloxera. Unquestionably some\r\nof the standard sorts used in France and California from _Vitis\r\nrupestris_ or _Vitis vulpina_, or hybrids of these species, would give\r\nbetter results. From theoretical consideration, it would seem that the\r\n_Vitis vulpina_ stocks should be best suited to the needs of eastern\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt was thought by the old experimenters that European grapes failed in\r\nNew York because of unfavorable climatic conditions. It was said that\r\nthe winters were too cold and the summers too hot and dry for this\r\ngrape. During the years the Station vineyard of Viniferas has been in\r\nexistence, there have been stresses of all kinds of weather to which\r\nthe variable climate of New York is subject. Two winters have been\r\nexceedingly cold, killing peach and pear trees; one summer gave the\r\nhottest weather and hottest day in twenty-five years; the vines have\r\nwithstood two severe summer droughts and three cold, wet summers.\r\nThese test seasons have proved that European grapes will stand the\r\nclimate of New York as well as the native varieties except in the\r\nmatter of cold; they must have winter protection.\r\n\r\nTo growers of American grapes, the extra work of winter protection\r\nseems to be an insuperable obstacle. The experience of several seasons\r\nin New York shows that winter protection is a cheap and simple matter.\r\nTwo methods have been used; vines have been covered with earth and\r\nothers have been wrapped with straw. The earth covering is cheaper and\r\nmore efficient. The vines are pruned and placed full length on the\r\nground and covered with a few inches of earth. The cost of winter\r\nprotection will run from two to three cents a vine. Since European\r\nvines are much more productive than those of American grapes, the\r\nadded cost of winter protection is more than offset by the greater\r\nyield of grapes. Trellising, also, is simpler and less expensive for\r\nthe European grapes, helping further to offset the cost of winter\r\nprotection.\r\n\r\n_Pruning._\r\n\r\nIt is apparent at once that European grapes must have special\r\ntreatment in pruning if they are to be laid on the ground annually.\r\nSeveral modifications of European and California practices can be\r\nemployed in the East to bring the plants in condition for winter\r\nlaying-down. All methods of pruning must have this in common; new wood\r\nmust be brought up from the base of the plant every year to permit\r\nbending the plant. This can be done by leaving a replacing spur at\r\nthe base of the trunk. If two-eye cions are used when the plants are\r\ngrafted and both buds grow, the shoot from the upper can be used to\r\nform the main trunk, while that from the lower bud will supply the\r\nreplacing spur. Each year all but one of the canes coming from this\r\nspur are removed and the remaining one is cut back to one or two buds\r\nuntil the main trunk begins to be too stiff to bend down readily, then\r\none cane from the spur is left for a new trunk and another is pruned\r\nfor a new renewal spur.\r\n\r\nThe main trunk is carried up only to the lower wire of the trellis. At\r\nthe winter pruning, two one-year canes are selected to be tied along\r\nthis wire, one on each side, and the two renewal spurs chosen for\r\ntying up and new renewal spurs left. For the best production,\r\ndifferent varieties require different lengths of fruit canes, but the\r\nwork at Geneva has not progressed far enough so that recommendations\r\ncan be made for particular varieties. It has been found best, however,\r\nto prune weak vines heavily and vigorous ones lightly. Under normal\r\nconditions, from four to eight buds are left on each cane, depending\r\non the vigor of the vine. With some of the older seedlings used for\r\nstocks in 1911 which were so large that two cions were used, and in\r\nmany of those where the roots seemed to have sufficient vigor to\r\nsupport the larger top, two trunks were formed, one from each graft.\r\nBy spreading these into a V and making the inner arms shorter, very\r\nsatisfactory results were secured.\r\n\r\nThe type of growth in Vinifera is different from that of native\r\ngrapes. The young shoots which spring from the one-year canes, instead\r\nof trailing to the ground or running out along the trellis wires, grow\r\nerect. Advantage must be taken of this in the pruning system adopted\r\nin the East. The canes and the renewal spurs as described above are\r\ntied along the lower wire; then the young shoots which come from these\r\ngrow upward to the second wire. When the shoots are four to six\r\ninches above this wire, they are pinched off just above the wire and\r\nany which have not already fastened themselves are tied to prevent the\r\nwind breaking them off. At the same time, if any of the axial buds on\r\nthe shoots have begun to form secondary shoots, they are rubbed off,\r\nbeginning with the node next above the upper cluster and going down to\r\nthe old cane. This gives the cluster more room and better light. Soon\r\nafter the first heading-back, the upper buds of the young shoot start\r\nlateral growth. The secondary branches usually grow upright and when\r\nthey are several inches high they are topped with a sickle. This\r\nheading-back results in stockier and more mature canes for the\r\nfollowing year, and if properly done adds to the fruitfulness of the\r\nvine and the fruit matures better.\r\n\r\n_General considerations._\r\n\r\nThe grower of European grapes grafted on American vines may be\r\nprepared to be surprised at the growth the vines make. At the end of\r\nthe first season, the grafts attain the magnitude of full-sized vines;\r\nthe second season they begin to fruit more or less abundantly, and the\r\nthird year they produce approximately the same number of bunches as a\r\nConcord or Niagara vine; and, as the bunches of most varieties are\r\nlarger than those of the American grapes, the yield, therefore, is\r\ngreater. The European varieties, also, may be set more closely than\r\nthe American sorts, since they are seldom such rampant growers.\r\n\r\nIt is too early to reason from this short experiment that we are to\r\ngrow varieties of European grapes commonly in the East, but the\r\nbehavior of the vines under discussion seems to indicate that we may\r\ndo so. At the New York Station, the European varieties are as vigorous\r\nand thrifty as American vines and quite as easily managed. Why may we\r\nnot grow these grapes if we protect them from phylloxera, fungi and\r\ncold? In Europe, there are varieties of grapes for nearly every soil\r\nand condition in the southern half of the continent. In eastern\r\nEurope and western Asia, the vines must be protected just as they must\r\nbe protected here. It seems almost certain that from the many sorts\r\nselected to meet the various conditions of Europe, we shall be able to\r\nfind kinds to meet the diverse soils and climates of this continent.\r\nAnd here we have one of the chief reasons for wishing to grow these\r\ngrapes that American grape-growing may not be so localized as at\r\npresent. Probably we shall find that European grapes can be grown\r\nunder a greater diversity of conditions than native varieties.\r\n\r\nThe culture of European grapes in the East gives this region\r\nessentially a new fruit. If any considerable degree of success attends\r\ntheir culture, wine-making in eastern America will be revolutionized,\r\nfor the European grapes are far superior to the native sorts for this\r\npurpose. Varieties of these grapes have a higher sugar- and\r\nsolid-content than do those of the American species and for this\r\nreason, as a rule, keep longer. We may thus expect that through these\r\ngrapes the season for this fruit will be extended. The European\r\nvarieties are better flavored, possessing a more delicate and a richer\r\nvinous flavor, a more agreeable aroma, and are lacking in the acidity\r\nand the obnoxious foxy taste of many American grapes. Many consumers\r\nof fruit will like them better and the demand for grapes thus will be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the European grape in the vineyards of eastern America\r\nought to greatly increase the production of hybrids between this\r\nspecies and the American species of grapes. As we have seen, there are\r\nmany such hybrids, but curiously enough scarcely more than a half\r\ndozen varieties of European grapes have been used in crossing. Most of\r\nthese have been greenhouse grapes and not those that could be expected\r\nto give best results for vineyard culture. As we come to know the\r\nvarieties best adapted to American conditions, we ought to be able to\r\nselect European parents to better advantage than we have done in the\r\npast and by using them produce better hybrid sorts.\r\n\r\n_Varieties._\r\n\r\nFrom the eighty-five varieties of European grapes now fruiting on the\r\ngrounds of the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, the following\r\nare named as worth trying in the East for table grapes: Actoni,\r\nBakator, Chasselas Golden, Chasselas Rose, Feher Szagos, Gray Pinot,\r\nLignan Blanc, Malvasia, Muscat Hamburg, Palomino and Rosaki. These and\r\nother European grapes are described in Chapter XVIII; Chasselas Golden\r\nand Malvasia are illustrated in Plate V.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XV.--Eclipse (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nGRAPES UNDER GLASS\r\n\r\n\r\nGrape-growing under glass is on the decline in America. Forty or fifty\r\nyears ago the industry was a considerable one, grapes being rather\r\ncommonly grown near all large cities for the market, and nearly every\r\nlarge estate possessing a range of glass had a grapery. But grapes are\r\nbetter and more cheaply grown in Europe than in America, and the\r\nadvent of quick transportation permits English, French and Belgian\r\ngrape-growers to send their wares to American markets more cheaply\r\nthan they can be grown at home. For the present, the world war has\r\nstopped the importation of luxuries from Europe, and American\r\ngardeners ought to find the culture of grapes under glass profitable;\r\nthey may expect also to be able to hold the markets for many years to\r\ncome because of the destruction of Belgian houses and the shortage of\r\nlabor in Europe resulting from the war.\r\n\r\nAmateur gardeners ought never to let the culture of grapes under glass\r\nwane, since the hot-house grape is the consummation of the gardener's\r\nskill. Certainly the forcing of no other fruit yields such generous\r\nrewards. Grapes grown under glass are handsomer in appearance and\r\nbetter in quality than those grown out-of-doors. The clusters often\r\nattain enormous size, a weight of twenty to thirty pounds being not\r\nuncommon. The impression prevails that to grow grapes under glass, one\r\nmust have expensive houses; this is not necessary, and \"hot-house\r\ngrapes\" is a misnomer, the fruit really being grown in cold or\r\nrelatively cool houses which need not be expensive. Grapes are grown\r\nunder glass with greater ease and certainty than is imagined by those\r\nwho form the opinion from buying the fruit at high prices in\r\ndelicatessen stores. A grapery need not be an expensive luxury, and\r\nthe culture of grapes under glass can be recommended to persons of\r\nmoderate means who are looking for a horticultural hobby.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAPERY\r\n\r\nAlmost any of the various modifications of greenhouses can be adapted\r\nto growing grapes. Firms constructing greenhouses usually have had\r\nexperience in building graperies, and, as a rule, it will pay to have\r\nthese professional builders put up the house. If the actual work is\r\nnot done by a builder, it is possible to purchase plans and estimates,\r\nfrom which, if sufficiently detailed, local builders can work. On\r\nsmall places there is no doubt that the lean-to houses are most\r\nsuitable, being inexpensive and furnishing protection from prevailing\r\nwinds. These lean-tos should face the south and may be built against\r\nthe stable, garage or other building; or better, a brick or stone wall\r\nto the north may be erected. It is possible to build a small grapery\r\nas a lean-to out of hot-house sash.\r\n\r\nIn commercial establishments and for large estates, where the grapery\r\nmust be more or less ornamental, a span-roof house is rather better\r\nadapted to the grapery than a lean-to, especially if the house is not\r\nto be used for the production of grapes early in the season. On\r\naccount of the exposure of the span-roof house on all sides, however,\r\nrather more skill must be exercised in growing grapes in them than in\r\nthe better protected lean-to grapery. Whatever the house, it must be\r\nso constructed as to furnish an abundance of light, a requisite in\r\nwhich much is gained by having large-size glasses for the glazing. The\r\nglass must be of the best quality, otherwise the foliage and fruit\r\nmay be blistered by the sun's rays being focused through defective\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nLight, heat, moisture and good ventilation are all required in the\r\ngrapery. Brick or stone are preferable to woodwork, as heat and\r\nmoisture in the grapery are quickly destructive to wood foundations.\r\nIf wood is used, only the most durable kinds should enter into the\r\nconstruction of the house. The under structure of masonry or of wood\r\nshould be low, not higher than 18 inches or 2 feet before the\r\nsuperstructure of glass begins. The grapery must be well ventilated.\r\nThere must be large ventilators at the peak of the house and small\r\nones just above the foundation walls or in the foundation walls\r\nthemselves. The ventilation should be such that the house can be kept\r\nfree from draughts or sudden changes of temperature, as the grape\r\nunder glass is a sensitive plant, and subject to mildew. Plenty of\r\nair, therefore, is an absolute necessity to the grapes, especially\r\nduring the ripening of the fruit. The lower ventilators in graperies\r\nare seldom much used until the grapes begin to color, at which time\r\nthe new growth, foliage and fruit are hardened, but from this time on\r\nupper and lower ventilators must be so manipulated that the houses are\r\nalways generously aired.\r\n\r\nGrapes can be forced in cold houses without the aid of artificial heat\r\nand formerly these cold graperies were very popular; but in the modern\r\nhouses for growing this fruit, artificial heat is now considered a\r\nnecessity, even though the heating apparatus may seldom be in use. For\r\na finely finished product, a little heat to warm the room and dry the\r\natmosphere may be absolutely necessary at a critical time, this often\r\nsaving a house of grapes. Of heating apparatus, little need be said.\r\nStandard boilers for heating greenhouses with either steam or hot\r\nwater are now to be purchased of many designs for almost every style\r\nand condition of house. Since the grapery seldom requires high heat,\r\nhot water is rather to be preferred to steam, although there is no\r\nobjection to steam, especially if the grapery is a part of a large\r\nrange of glass.\r\n\r\n_The border._\r\n\r\nThe border in which the vines are to be planted is the most important\r\npart of the grapery. All subsequent efforts fail if the border lacks\r\nin two imperatives, good drainage and a soil that is rich but not too\r\nrich. The grapery must be built on well-drained land or elevated above\r\nthe ground to permit the construction of a properly drained border.\r\n\"Border,\" in the sense of its being a strip or a narrow bed just\r\ninside the house, is now a misnomer, though the name undoubtedly comes\r\nfrom the fact that narrow beds inside the house were at one time used\r\nin which to plant vines. The border in a modern grapery now occupies\r\nall of the ground surface inside the house and may extend several feet\r\noutside the house.\r\n\r\nMuch skill is required in building the border. A good formula is: Six\r\nparts loamy turf from an old pasture; one part of well-rotted cow\r\nmanure; one part of old plaster and one part of ground bone. These\r\ningredients are composted and if the work is well done will meet very\r\nwell the soil and food requirements of the grape. This formula can be\r\nvaried according to soil conditions and somewhat in accordance with\r\nthe variety planted. Unless natural drainage is well-nigh perfect, the\r\nborder must be under-drained with tile and in any case a layer of old\r\nbrick or stone is needful to make certain that the drainage is\r\nperfect. At least two feet, better three feet, of the border compost\r\nshould be placed above the drainage material. In a border made as\r\ndescribed, the grape finds ample root-run, but not too much, as in a\r\nsurprisingly short time roots are found throughout all parts of this\r\nextensive border.\r\n\r\nThe care of the border is a matter of considerable moment and varies,\r\nof course, with those in charge. The usual procedure is to spade the\r\noutside border, if the border extends outside, before winter, after\r\nwhich it is covered with a coating of well-rotted manure, without any\r\nparticular attempt having been made to keep out the frost, as a\r\ncertain amount of freezing outside of the house is held to be\r\nbeneficial. The inside border must be spaded just before the vines are\r\nstarted in the spring, having been covered previously with well-rotted\r\nmanure. The time at which the vines are to be started in growth is\r\ndetermined by whether an early or a late crop of grapes is wanted. For\r\nan early crop, the vines must be started early in February; for a late\r\ncrop, a month or even two months later suffices. So started, the first\r\ncrop of grapes comes on in June or July, the later ones following in\r\nAugust or September.\r\n\r\nIt is related that Napoleon I, to secure saltpetre for making\r\ngunpowder, composted \"filth, dead animals, urine and offal with\r\nalternate layers of turf and lime mortar,\" and asserted that \"a\r\nnitre-bed is the very pattern of a vine-border\" and that \"when the\r\nmaterials have been turned over and over again for a year or two they\r\nare in exactly the proper state to yield either gunpowder or grapes.\"\r\nNapoleon's niter-bed is not now considered a good model for a\r\ngrape-border, as the fruit produced in so rich a soil, though\r\nabundant, is coarse and poorly flavored, and the vines complete their\r\nown destruction by over-bearing. Gardeners hold that a grape-border\r\nmay be too rich in plant-food, especially too rich in nitrogen.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES\r\n\r\nOut of the 2000 or more Vinifera grapes, probably not more than a\r\nscore are grown under glass, and of these but a half dozen are\r\ncommonly grown. Black varieties have the preference for indoors,\r\nespecially if grown for the market, where they bring the highest\r\nprices. They are also as a rule more easily handled indoors than the\r\nwhite sorts. However, as we shall see, one or two white kinds are\r\nindispensable in a house of any considerable size.\r\n\r\nOf black grapes, Black Hamburg carries the palm of merit because it is\r\nmost easily grown, best stands neglect, is a heavy producer, sets its\r\nfruit well, the grapes mature early; and, in particular, it meets the\r\nrequirements of the unskilled gardener better than any other grape.\r\nThe clusters are not as large and the flavor not as good as that of\r\nsome other sorts.\r\n\r\nMuscat of Alexandria is the best of the white varieties. It is,\r\nhowever, a hard grape to handle since it requires a high temperature\r\nto bring it to perfection, is a little shy in setting fruit and the\r\ngrapes are not very certain in coming to maturity; it also requires a\r\nlong season. A good quality is that it may be kept long after cutting,\r\nmuch longer than Black Hamburg.\r\n\r\nFor an earlier white grape, Buckland Sweetwater has much to recommend\r\nit; it ripens from two to three weeks earlier than Muscat of\r\nAlexandria and is much more easily grown. It is good in quality but\r\nnot of high quality. Buckland Sweetwater may be well grown in the\r\nhouse with Black Hamburg, whereas it is almost impossible to grow\r\nMuscat of Alexandria in the same house with Black Hamburg.\r\n\r\nMuscat Hamburg is a cross between Black Hamburg and Muscat of\r\nAlexandria, and is an intermediate in most fruit characters between\r\nthese two standard sorts. It is not, however, very generally grown,\r\nalthough it well deserves to be because of its large, beautiful,\r\ntapering clusters of black grapes of finest quality.\r\n\r\nGrizzly Frontignan adds novelty to luxury in the list of indoor\r\ngrapes. The fruits are mottled pink in color, deepening sometimes to a\r\ndark shade of pink, and are borne in long, slender clusters. The\r\ngrapes ripen early and are unsurpassed in quality but are, all in all,\r\nrather difficult to grow.\r\n\r\nBarbarossa and Gros Colman are the two best late black grapes,\r\nespecially for those who are ambitious to grow clusters of large size\r\nwith large berries. Both are very good in quality. Neither of the two\r\nis particularly easy to grow, since they require a long time to ripen;\r\nbut, to offset this, both keep longer than any other sorts after\r\nripening. Because of the large size of the berries, thinning must\r\nbegin early and must be rather more severe than with other grapes.\r\nThis variety is now largely grown in England for exportation to this\r\ncountry in early spring.\r\n\r\nWhite Nice and Syrian are two white sorts which attain largest size in\r\nclusters, specimens weighing thirty pounds being not infrequent, but\r\nare coarse and poor in quality and are, therefore, hardly worth\r\ngrowing.\r\n\r\nAlicante is a black sort often grown for the sake of variety, since it\r\ndeparts from the Vinifera type rather markedly in flavor. The grapes\r\nhave very thick skins and may be kept longer than those of any other\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nLady Downs is another late-keeping black grape of highest quality, but\r\ndifficult to grow. The bunches and berries are small in comparison\r\nwith other standard sorts, characters that do not commend the variety\r\nto most gardeners.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a dozen more sorts might be named worthy of trial in American\r\ngraperies, but the list given covers the needs of commercial\r\nestablishments and will meet the wants of most amateur growers.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANTING AND TRAINING\r\n\r\nTwo-year-old vines are most commonly planted. The vines are set inside\r\nthe house at least a foot from the walls and four feet apart. The\r\ngrapery must be built on piers with spaces of at least two feet\r\nbetween, and the vines are placed opposite these openings in the\r\nfoundation. When planted, the vines are cut back to two or three buds,\r\nand when these start the strongest are selected for training, the\r\nothers being rubbed off. The grapery must be strung with wires\r\nrunning lengthwise of the house at about fifteen inches from the\r\nglass. Greenhouse supply merchants furnish at a low price cast iron\r\nbrackets to be fastened to the rafters to hold these wires. As the\r\ngrowing vines reach one wire after another, they are tied with raffia\r\nto hold them in place. Usually, young vines will reach the peak of the\r\nhouse by midsummer, and as soon as this goal is attained must be\r\npinched so that the cane may thicken up and store food in the lateral\r\nbuds for the coming season. When the wood is well matured, the vine is\r\ncut back to half or one-third its length, depending on the variety,\r\nlaid on the ground and covered for the winter. An item of no small\r\nimportance in winter care is to keep out mice, this pest being\r\ninordinately fond of grape buds, and once the buds are destroyed the\r\nvines are ruined for the coming season.\r\n\r\nThe second year's work is largely a repetition of that of the first.\r\nThe vines are permitted to reach the peak of the house and are again\r\nstopped by pinching. A considerable number of laterals spring up on\r\neach side of the main vine, and these must be thinned as they develop\r\nto stand at the distance apart of the wires to which they are\r\nfastened. This is pre-supposing that the gardener has chosen the spur\r\nmethod of pruning, the method generally used in America and the one,\r\nall things considered, which gives best results. The selection of the\r\nlaterals the second year, therefore, is a matter of much importance\r\nsince spurs are to be developed from them. Care should be taken to\r\nhave these spurs regularly distributed over the length of the vine.\r\nThis second year, grapes must not be permitted to develop on the\r\nterminal shoots, but a few clusters may be taken from the laterals in\r\nwhich case the laterals are pinched two buds beyond the cluster, the\r\npinching continuing throughout the season if the laterals persist in\r\nbreaking, as they will do in most cases. At the end of the season, the\r\nterminal is shortened at least one-half, and the laterals are pinched\r\nback to a bud as close as possible to the main stem. The vines are\r\nthen put down for the winter as at the close of the first season.\r\n\r\nThe work of the third season is a repetition of that of the second,\r\nwith the exception that the vine is permitted to fruit throughout its\r\nwhole length, although not more than one pound of fruit to a foot of\r\nmain vine is permitted. The plants are now established and the only\r\npruning in this and succeeding years is to cut the laterals at the\r\nclose of each season close to the main stem, leaving strong healthy\r\nbuds of which at least one, usually more, will be found close to the\r\nstem. If more than one bud starts, only the strongest is chosen,\r\nalthough often an extra one is needed to fill a vacancy on the\r\nopposite side. After the third or fourth season, depending somewhat on\r\nthe variety, two pounds of fruit or more to the foot of the main stem\r\ncan be permitted. The novice, however, is likely to permit his vines\r\nto overbear with the result that the crop is cast, or the berries\r\nrattle, or the fruit turns sour before ripening. From the beginning to\r\nthe finish of the season, in this method of pruning, much pinching of\r\nlaterals is required. No hard and fast rule can be laid down for this\r\npinching, but, roughly speaking, all new growth beyond the second\r\njoint from the cluster should be pinched out as fast as it shows. With\r\nmost varieties, this means that the lateral is kept about eighteen\r\ninches from the main stem. After a few years, well-developed spurs\r\nform at the base of the original laterals, and from these spurs the\r\nnew wood comes year after year.\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of pruning is to permit the new canes to grow up\r\nfrom a bud near the ground each season. When the vine is well\r\nestablished, this new cane is fruited throughout its entire length,\r\nthe laterals being pinched as described under the spur method. This\r\nmethod of pruning is known as \"the long cane method.\" Gardeners hold\r\nthat they can grow better fruit with this than with the spur method,\r\nbut the difficulties are greater and the crop is not as large.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE VINES\r\n\r\nWith the cultivation of all varieties indoors, more clusters set than\r\nthe vines can carry. This means that a part of the clusters must be\r\nremoved, an operation that depends on the variety and one that\r\nrequires experience and judgment on the part of the gardener. Roughly\r\nspeaking, half the clusters are taken, leaving the other half as\r\nevenly distributed on each side of the vine as possible. The time to\r\ntake these clusters is also a delicate matter, since some sorts are\r\nshy in setting and the clusters must not be taken until the berries\r\nare formed and it can be seen how large the crop will be. As a rule,\r\nhowever, this thinning of clusters may be begun as soon as the form of\r\nthe cluster can be seen.\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary also, especially with all sorts bearing large\r\nberries, that grapes be thinned in the cluster. The time to thin the\r\ncluster varies with the variety. Sorts which set fruit freely can be\r\nthinned sooner than those which are shy in setting. On the one hand,\r\nthe thinning must not be done too soon as it cannot be told until the\r\nberries are of fair size which have set seed and which have not;\r\nhowever, if thinning is neglected too long, the berries become\r\nover-crowded and the task becomes difficult. The thinning is performed\r\nwith slender scissors, and the bunches must not be touched with the\r\nhand, as touching impairs the bloom and disfigures the fruit. The\r\nclusters are turned and steadied by a small piece of pencil-shaped\r\nwood. Thinning is practiced not only to permit the berries to attain\r\ntheir full size but also to permit the bunches to attain as great size\r\nas possible. If too severely thinned, the clusters flatten out after\r\nmaturity. This is especially the case when too many berries are taken\r\nfrom the center of the bunch. A large cluster of grapes is made up of\r\nseveral small clusters, making it necessary to tie up the upper\r\nclusters or shoulders of the bunch to permit the berries to swell\r\nwithout being thinned too severely. Grapes intended for long keeping\r\nrequire more thinning than those to be used at once after picking,\r\nsince, in keeping, the berries mold or damp-off in the center of the\r\nbunch if it is too compact.\r\n\r\nThe vines in the grapery must be watered with considerable care. The\r\namount of water to be used depends on the composition of the borders\r\nand the season of growth. If the border is loose and well-drained, the\r\nsupply of water must be large; if close and retentive, but a small\r\namount of moisture is required. Watering must not be done during the\r\nperiod of blossoming, since dry air is necessary for proper\r\npollination. When the grapes begin to show color, the vines are\r\nheavily watered, after which little if any water is applied. Some\r\ngardeners mulch the vines with hay to retain the moisture in the house\r\nand keep the atmosphere dry.\r\n\r\nVentilating the grapery is another important detail of the season's\r\nwork. Proper ventilation is difficult to secure in the early spring\r\nmonths when the dryness of the sun on the one hand, and cold air on\r\nthe other, make it difficult to avoid draughts and regulate the\r\ntemperature. Another troublesome time is when the grapes begin to\r\ncolor, as it is then necessary for the grapery to have air at night;\r\nbut when too much air enters, there is danger from mildew. Towards the\r\nend of the season, all parts of the plant become harder in texture and\r\nthe grapery may then be more generously aired. After the fruit is cut,\r\nthe houses are ventilated in full so that the wood may ripen properly.\r\n\r\n\r\nPESTS\r\n\r\nSeveral pests vex the gardener in growing grapes indoors. Of these,\r\nmealy-bug, red-spider, thrips and mildew are most troublesome. In a\r\nwell-conducted grapery, there is never an intermission in the warfare\r\nagainst these pests.\r\n\r\nMealy-bug is usually a sign of sloth on the part of the gardener. In\r\na grapery devoted exclusively to grape-growing, it should never be\r\nseen, but, since gardeners must often grow other plants in the\r\ngrapery, mealy-bug sooner or later appears and is often hard to\r\ndislodge. It is best repelled by removing the loose bark on the trunks\r\nwhich harbor the pest and then washing with kerosene emulsion. When\r\nthis becomes necessary, not only the vines but the rafters and all\r\nparts of the house should be sprayed with the emulsion.\r\n\r\nRed-spider is another pest usually found in the grapery, but it\r\nthrives only in a dry atmosphere and is easily gotten rid of by\r\nsyringing. As soon as red-spider appears in a house its appearance is\r\nusually known by the reddish tinge on the foliage; syringing should be\r\nkept up until the pest is disposed of, keeping the house damp in all\r\nexcept dull weather. Syringing is done only when plenty of air can be\r\ngiven and when it can be followed by sunlight so that the water\r\nremains on the vines as short a time as possible.\r\n\r\nThrips, another small insect, is sometimes troublesome but not often\r\nand is now easily controlled by applications of nicotine. Much care\r\nmust be taken in the application of nicotine late in the season,\r\notherwise the fruit will be injured.\r\n\r\nThe only fungous disease of the grape troublesome in the greenhouse is\r\nmildew. Mildew is usually brought on by a sudden change of temperature\r\nor by draughts in the grapery. Gardeners are of the opinion that east\r\nwinds, in particular, give unfavorable conditions for mildew and\r\nprefer to open the ventilators to the west. If taken in time, mildew\r\nis easily kept in check by preventing the conditions which favor it,\r\nand by dusting the vines in dry sunshine with sulfur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVI.--Elvira (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nGRAPE PESTS AND THEIR CONTROL\r\n\r\n\r\nIn common with other cultivated fruits, grapes are at the mercy of\r\nnumerous insect and fungous pests unless man intervenes with remedial\r\nor preventive treatment. Happily for viticulture, knowledge of the\r\npests of the vine has made such advancement in recent years that\r\npractically all are now controlled by remedial or preventive measures.\r\nPossibly no field of agriculture has had greater need, or received\r\ngreater aid from science in the study and control of insects and\r\ndiseases than grape-growing. A separate treatise would be required to\r\ntreat the pathological troubles of the grape fully; only such details\r\nof the life histories of the several pests to be discussed as are\r\nessential to a proper understanding of the control of the parasites\r\ncan be given here.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECT PESTS\r\n\r\nInsects troubling the grapes are numerous, at least 200 having been\r\ndescribed in America, most of which have their habitat on the wild\r\nprototypes of the cultivated vines of this continent. For this reason,\r\nwith a few exceptions, the insect pests of the grape in America are\r\nwidely distributed, abundant, and, therefore, often very destructive\r\nto vineyards unless vigorously combated. The many pestiferous species\r\nvary greatly in importance, depending on locality, weather and the\r\nvariety. Phylloxera, however, the country over, is most common and\r\ndeserves first attention.\r\n\r\n_Phylloxera._\r\n\r\nThis minute sucking insect (_Phylloxera vastatrix_), injures the grape\r\nby feeding on its roots. Decay usually follows its work on the roots\r\nand is often more injurious than the harm done directly by the\r\nparasite. This decay is always much more serious on European vines\r\nthan on those of our native species. The phylloxera is a native of the\r\nUnited States east of the Rocky Mountains, from whence it was\r\nintroduced into France and from France into California, where it\r\ncauses much greater damage than elsewhere in the United States.\r\nWherever the pest is found, it is more injurious in heavy than in\r\nsandy soils. In fact, in very sandy soils the vines are often\r\nsufficiently resistant to be practically immune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36. Leaf-galls of the phylloxera.]\r\n\r\nThe life history of the phylloxera is very complex where the different\r\nforms of the insect appear and need not be entered into in detail\r\nhere. East of the Rockies, the most evident indication of the presence\r\nof the pest is great numbers of leaf-galls on the under side of the\r\nleaves of the grape as shown in Fig. 36. These galls, however, are\r\nseldom to be seen in California and are not present on Concords and\r\nsome other varieties in the East. The winter egg may be taken as the\r\nbeginning of the life cycle of the phylloxera. From a single winter\r\negg a colony may arise, the first insect after hatching making its\r\nway to the leaves where it becomes a gall-maker and gives rise to a\r\nnew generation of egg-laying root-feeders. On varieties and in regions\r\nwhere the gall form is not found, the insect probably goes directly\r\nfrom the winter egg to the roots. Once the pest is established on the\r\nroots, generation follows generation throughout the growing period of\r\nthe vines, as many as seven or eight occurring in one season.\r\n\r\nFrom midsummer until the close of the growing season, some of the eggs\r\ndeposited by the root-feeders develop into nymphs which acquire wings\r\nand emerge from the soil to form new colonies from eggs deposited on\r\nthe under side of the leaf. An individual insect deposits from three\r\nto six eggs of two sizes, from the larger of which come the females\r\nand these, after fertilization, move to the rough bark of the vine and\r\ndeposit the winter egg for the renewal of the cycle.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods of control have been employed in Europe and\r\nCalifornia, as treatment by carbon bisulfide injected in the soil;\r\nflooding in vineyards that can be irrigated; confining the vines to\r\nsandy soils; and, most important, planting vines grafted on resistant\r\nstocks, there being great variation in immunity of species of American\r\ngrapes to phylloxera. The subject of stocks resistant to this pest has\r\nbeen discussed in Chapter IV and need not be taken up again. East of\r\nthe Rockies, treatment is not necessary with American grapes.\r\n\r\n_The grape root-worm._\r\n\r\nThe grape root-worm is the most harmful of the insect pests of grapes\r\nin the grape-belt along the shores of Lake Erie in Ohio, Pennsylvania\r\nand New York. This root-worm (Fig. 37) is the larva of a grayish-brown\r\nbeetle (_Fidia viticida_), shown in Fig. 38. The worms feed at first\r\non the rootlets and later on the bark of the larger roots of the vines\r\nso that the injured plants show roots devoid of rootlets and bark\r\nchanneled by the pest. So plain is the work of the root-worm that the\r\ngrower never need be at a loss as to the cause of vines injured by\r\nthis pest. The worms feed during the latter part of the growing\r\nseason, reaching full growth at this time. The next June they\r\ntransform into pupæ and in late June or early July emerge as adult\r\nbeetles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37. The grape root-worm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38. Root-worm beetle.]\r\n\r\nThe presence of the adult beetles is more easily detected on the\r\nfoliage than is that of the larvæ on the roots, for the feeding\r\nbeetles ravenously devour the upper sides of the leaves, leaving\r\nchain-like markings, shown in Fig. 39, their destructiveness\r\ndecreasing somewhat after a few days from their first appearance. A\r\nfortnight after the beetles begin their attack on the foliage the\r\nfemale begins laying her eggs, to the number of 200, placing them\r\nunder the rough bark of trunk and cane. These hatch in late July or\r\nAugust and the young grubs at once seek the roots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39. Injuries caused by beetles of the grape\r\nroot-worm.]\r\n\r\nTwo methods of control have been devised: destruction of the beetles\r\nbefore they lay their eggs; and destruction of the pupæ while in the\r\nground. When the beetles are present in large numbers, many of them\r\nmay be destroyed by spraying with a mixture of cheap molasses and\r\narsenate of lead, using molasses at the rate of two gallons to a\r\nhundred gallons of water and the arsenate of lead at the rate of six\r\npounds. This should be followed by a second spraying a week later,\r\nusing bordeaux mixture (4-4-50) and three pounds of arsenate of lead.\r\nThis second spray serves to repel migrating beetles from the vines.\r\nThe molasses spray is ineffective unless several days of fair weather\r\nfollow the spraying, as rain washes the material from the foliage.\r\nBordeaux mixture is not easily affected by rain. In moderately\r\ninfested vineyards, bordeaux mixture and arsenate are used instead of\r\nmolasses and arsenate of lead, followed in about ten days with a\r\nsecond application of the same material.\r\n\r\nAn effective method of reducing the number of beetles is the\r\ndestruction of the pupæ. This is best done by leaving a low ridge of\r\nearth under the vines at the last seasonal cultivation to remain until\r\nmost of the larvæ have pupated, and then be leveled with a horse-hoe\r\nand later with a harrow. The horse-hoe and harrow crush many of the\r\npupæ and break the cells of others to the great destruction of the\r\npest. This latter method of control is not adequate in itself and in\r\nbad infestations both should be used. When the infestation is only\r\nmoderate, this latter method is not advised, owing to the lateness of\r\nthe time of horse-hoeing. It is good horticultural practice to\r\nhorse-hoe the latter part of May or early June. To wait for the pupal\r\nstage of the root-worm delays the work until numerous small roots\r\nstart which would be destroyed by the horse-hoe. Spraying will control\r\na moderate infestation.\r\n\r\n_The grape-vine flea-beetle._\r\n\r\nIn the warm days of May and June when the buds of grapes are swelling,\r\na shining steel-blue beetle may often be found in the vineyards of\r\neastern America feeding on the tender buds of the grape. From its\r\ncolor the insect is often called the steely-beetle, and from its\r\nactivity and habit of jumping it is known as the flea-beetle (_Haltica\r\nchalybea_). The vine is seldom seriously injured by this pest but many\r\nbuds are destroyed, causing the loss of the fruit that should have\r\ndeveloped from the buds. It is true that new buds often develop after\r\nthe injury, but these, as a rule, produce only foliage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40. Eggs of grape-vine flea-beetle.]\r\n\r\nThe life history of the flea-beetle is such that the pest is not hard\r\nto control, the chief steps in its development being as follows: The\r\nbeetles deposit small orange-colored eggs, cylindrical in form,\r\nillustrated in Fig. 40, about the buds and in crevices of the bark of\r\nthe canes in May or June. Most of these eggs are hatched by the middle\r\nof June. The larvæ feed upon the foliage until about July first and\r\nthen crawl to the ground in which they form cells and pupate. The\r\nlatter part of July the adults emerge and seek wild vines upon which\r\nthey feed, entering hibernation rather early in the fall. The beetles\r\nhibernate under leaves, in rubbish and in the shelter of the bark of\r\ntrees and vines, but emerge in the warm days the following spring to\r\nseek vineyards.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of control have been developed to keep this pest under.\r\nThe vines should be sprayed with three pounds of arsenate of lead in\r\nfifty gallons of water when the larvæ are feeding on the foliage; or\r\nthe beetles when feeding may be knocked into a pan containing a\r\nshallow layer of kerosene. The former is the cheaper and more\r\neffective method provided the grape-grower has the foresight to\r\ndiscover the larvæ, since the larvæ of this summer produce the beetles\r\nthat will destroy the buds next spring. When the adults migrate from\r\nwild vines, or the larvæ were not destroyed in the vineyard,\r\ncollecting the adults is the only practical method. The destruction of\r\nwild vines near a vineyard helps to give immunity from this pest.\r\n\r\n_The rose-chafer._\r\n\r\nThe rose-chafer (_Macrodactylus subspinosus_), a long-legged beetle of\r\na yellowish-brown color, about a third of an inch in length, often\r\nappears in vineyards in vast swarms toward the middle of June in\r\nnorthern states and about two weeks earlier in southern states east of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Often they overrun gardens, orchards, vineyards\r\nand nurseries, and usually, after having done a vast amount of damage\r\nin the month of their devastating presence, the beetles disappear as\r\nsuddenly as they came. Vineyards on or near sandy soils are most often\r\ninfested, the larvæ of the beetle seeming to live in considerable\r\nnumbers only in these light soils. The chief damage to the grape is\r\ndone to the blossom; in fact the insects, after feeding on the\r\nblossoms during the blossoming period, usually migrate to blossoms of\r\nany one of several shrubs. The larvæ feed on the roots of grasses,\r\nhaving particular liking for the roots of foxtail, timothy and\r\nblue-grass.\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of the life history of these beetles is essential to\r\neffective control. The beetles emerge as adults in June and after\r\nfeeding a short time begin to mate, although egg-laying does not take\r\nplace until the insects have been out for a fortnight or more. The\r\nfemales burrow into the soil and deposit their eggs, seldom more than\r\ntwenty-five in number, which begin to hatch in about ten days. The\r\nyoung larvæ feed during the remainder of the summer on roots of\r\ngrasses. They are seldom found deeper than six inches while feeding,\r\nbut as cold weather approaches they burrow deeper to avoid sudden\r\nchanges of temperature. The following spring they again come near the\r\nsurface to feed. The grubs form cells from which the pupæ emerge, as\r\nwe have seen, about the middle of June, timing their appearance very\r\nclosely to the blossoming of Concord grapes.\r\n\r\nThe methods of control are three, namely: destruction of the larvæ;\r\ncultivation to kill the pupæ; and spraying to kill the beetles. Since\r\nthe larvæ feed on the roots of grasses in sandy soils, it is easy to\r\nlocate the feeding ground of the pest and plant it to cultivated crops\r\nwhich destroy the grasses and therefore the larvæ. The second method\r\nof destruction is similar, consisting of cultivation to kill the pupæ.\r\nThis is accomplished by thorough cultivation during the pupating stage\r\nto break the cells and crush the pupæ, thus preventing the emergence\r\nof the beetles. The third method, however, is the most effective and\r\nconsists of spraying the vineyard with a sweetened arsenical spray.\r\nThe spraying should be done as soon as the beetles appear, using\r\narsenate of lead six pounds, molasses one gallon and water one hundred\r\ngallons. It is often necessary to make a second application a week\r\nlater. If rain occurs within thirty-six hours after spraying, the\r\napplication should be repeated as soon as the weather clears.\r\n\r\n_The grape leaf-hopper._\r\n\r\nFrom Canada to the Gulf and from the Atlantic to the Pacific, wherever\r\nthe grape is grown, the small leaf-hopper (_Typhlocyba comes_) infests\r\nthe grape in greater or less numbers, feeding on the lower surface of\r\nthe leaf. Grape-growers commonly call these insects \"thrips,\" a name,\r\nhowever, which really belongs to a very different class of insects.\r\nThe injury done by this pest varies greatly with the season and the\r\nlocality, in some regions it being comparatively harmless and in\r\nothers exceedingly destructive in seasons when it occurs in abundance.\r\nThere is great variation also in individual vineyards, those near\r\nfavorable hibernating places and early spring food plants often being\r\ninjured seriously season after season in succession. These\r\nleaf-hoppers obtain their food by piercing the epidermis on the under\r\nside of the leaf surface and sucking the sap, and add further injury\r\nby inserting their eggs underneath the skin of the leaf. The punctures\r\ngreatly decrease the starch-producing area of the leaf with the result\r\nthat the vigor of the plant is lowered, and the quality of the fruit\r\ndecreased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41. First four stages of the grape leaf-hopper.\r\n(Enlarged.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42. The fifth and the mature stages of the grape\r\nleaf-hopper. (Enlarged.)]\r\n\r\nThe life history of the leaf-hopper is very well known. The eggs are\r\ndeposited in June or early July, and hatch from June 15 to July 10 in\r\nNew York, the season being earlier or later as one goes south or\r\nnorth. The young leaf-hoppers are wingless, the nymph stage, but reach\r\nthe adult stage in late July and August, at which time many of them\r\nmate, and eggs are laid from which a second brood may develop,\r\nalthough usually only one full brood is produced in a season in the\r\nnorthern states. Figures 41 and 42 show the several life stages of the\r\nleaf-hopper. Insects which become adults in the latter part of July\r\nfeed on the foliage until autumn and then seek winter quarters,\r\npassing the winter in the adult stage under fallen leaves, in dead\r\ngrass or other similar protection. The hibernating place must be dry\r\nand for this reason sandy knolls are most favored by the insects. The\r\nadults emerge in the warm days of spring and then seek food first on\r\nthe strawberry, then migrate to red and black raspberries or\r\nblackberries, if raspberries are not present. They remain upon these\r\nhosts until the grape leaves expand and then migrate to these to feed,\r\nlay their eggs and die.\r\n\r\nThree methods of control are in use to prevent the ravages of the\r\nleaf-hopper: avoiding the planting of raspberries near grapes;\r\nspraying with contact insecticides; and the destruction of hibernating\r\nplaces. Since the leaf-hoppers feed especially on the raspberry before\r\nthe leaves of the grape have expanded in the spring, avoiding planting\r\nthese two plants near each other is a very effective method of\r\ncontrol. The contact spray must touch the body of the insect and must,\r\ntherefore, be applied before the nymphs develop wings. The best spray\r\nis a half pint of Black Leaf 40 to a hundred gallons of water or\r\nbordeaux mixture. It is applied to the under side of the foliage by a\r\ntrailing hose or by an automatic grape leaf-hopper spray devised by F.\r\nZ. Hartzell and described in bulletin 344 of the New York Experiment\r\nStation. The destruction of hibernating places is almost as effective\r\na method of control as spraying. All weeds and strong-stalked grasses\r\nwhich die in the fall and all rubbish in the vineyard should be\r\ndestroyed. It is quite worth while, also, to burn leaves and rubbish\r\nin fence rows and waste places near infested vineyards in the autumn\r\nor early winter. Cover-crops which remain green during the winter do\r\nnot harbor the leaf-hoppers.\r\n\r\n_The grape-berry moth._\r\n\r\nThis pest is widely distributed, attacking the grape wherever grown in\r\nNorth America. The insect feeds on all varieties but is especially\r\ndestructive to grapes with tender skins and such as grow in compact\r\nbunches. Its work is detected usually in compact grape clusters where\r\na number of berries are injured by a \"worm.\" The \"worm\" is a\r\ndark-colored caterpillar, the larva of the grape-berry moth\r\n(_Polychrosis viteana_.) There are two broods of this caterpillar, the\r\nfirst of which feeds on the stems and external portions of the young\r\nberries, while the second attacks the berries. The loss to the\r\nfruit-grower is of two kinds, the loss of the fruit and the marring of\r\nclusters which entails the cost of picking out worthless berries.\r\nFigure 43 shows the work of the grape-berry moth. The damage is\r\nusually greatest near woodlands since the trees cause more snow to\r\nlodge in the adjoining vineyards, this protection permitting a greater\r\npercentage of pupæ to survive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. A bunch of grapes despoiled by the grape-berry\r\nmoth.]\r\n\r\nThe moth passes the winter in the pupal state on leaves underneath the\r\nvine, emerging about the time grapes are blossoming. The sexes then\r\nmate and the eggs are laid on the stems, blossom clusters and newly\r\nset fruit. After reaching full growth, the caterpillars cut out a\r\nportion of the leaf from which they make a pupal case by means of\r\nsilken threads, and here pupate for the second brood which emerges in\r\nlate July and August. Eggs are laid at once and from these come the\r\ncaterpillars which live entirely in the berry. The larvæ leave the\r\nberries about the time the fruit is ripe, form cocoons on the leaves\r\nand hibernate. The moths are small, brown in color, mottled with gray\r\nand so much the color of the grape cane that they can hardly be\r\ndetected when resting on the wood.\r\n\r\nThe grape-berry moth is difficult to control but much can be done to\r\ncurtail its ravages. Spraying after the fruit sets is the most\r\neffective preventive. Bordeaux mixture should be used (4-4-50) to\r\nwhich has been added one and one-half pounds of resin-fish-oil soap\r\nand three pounds arsenate of lead. A second application of the same\r\nspray is advisable in early August. In a small vineyard or with a\r\nslight infestation, it often pays to pick and destroy the berries\r\ninfested by the spring brood. Plowing infested vineyards in late fall\r\nor early spring to bury all leaves prevents the emergence of many of\r\nthe moths. To be effective, this practice must cover the leaves deeply\r\ndirectly under the vines and this earth must remain until after the\r\ntime for the adults to emerge. Plowing under leaves is not as\r\neffective on sandy as on heavy soils, since sandy soils do not become\r\nsufficiently compact to prevent the escape of moths.\r\n\r\n_Insect pests of minor importance._\r\n\r\nOf the 200 species of insects that feed more or less on the grape,\r\nentomologists mention several others than those described that in\r\noccasional years or localities become abundant and cause serious\r\ninjury. Thus, there are several species of cut-worms which sometimes\r\nfeed on the expanding buds of the young leaves of grapes. The damage\r\nof these cut-worms to the grape is greater in California than in other\r\nparts of the United States, but nevertheless they occasionally feed on\r\nthe vines in eastern regions to the detriment of the crop. The most\r\nsatisfactory control measure for cut-worms is the application of\r\npoisoned bait placed on the ground at the base of the vines.\r\n\r\nIn California there is a grape root-worm (_Adoxus obscurus_) quite\r\ndistinct from the grape root-worm of eastern America which injures\r\nboth the roots and the parts of the vine above ground. As in the\r\neastern species, the best evidence of infestation of this pest is the\r\nnarrow chain-like strips eaten out of the leaves, though the insect\r\nalso gouges out part of the petioles, pedicels, berries and shoots and\r\nworks under ground, eating the rootlets and bark of the larger roots.\r\nInfested vines show a stunted condition, the canes fail to attain a\r\nnormal growth and often the vines are killed outright. As in the case\r\nof the eastern species, this root-worm is the larva of a beetle, the\r\nlife history of the insect not being greatly different from that of\r\nthe eastern beetle. Two methods of control are fairly effective: the\r\nadult beetles may be jarred from the vine and captured on a screen\r\nwhen the infestation is restricted to small areas; or the beetles may\r\nbe poisoned with the arsenical spray recommended for the eastern\r\nspecies. Both jarring and spraying often have to be repeated as new\r\ninfestations appear.\r\n\r\nThe grape leaf-folder (_Desmia funeralis_) is another insect pest of\r\nvineyards in California, and occasionally in the East, which works,\r\nhowever, only in restricted localities and in occasional years. In\r\nCalifornia, the insects are detected in a vineyard by the\r\ncharacteristic rolling of the leaves in which a tube rather less than\r\nthe diameter of a lead pencil is formed for the home of the larvæ. The\r\nlarvæ feed on the free edge of the leaf in the interior of the roll\r\nand are thus protected by the outer layers. In the East the\r\ncaterpillar merely folds the edges of the leaves together. This\r\nleaf-folder hibernates as a chrysalis, coming forth in early spring to\r\nlay eggs on the vine shortly after the foliage has appeared. There are\r\ntwo broods in California and the northern states and three broods in\r\nthe southern states. The leaf-folder is easily disposed of by spraying\r\nwith an arsenical spray just after the eggs hatch and before the larva\r\nis protected by its roll of leaves.\r\n\r\nStill another pest found throughout the United States and especially\r\ndestructive in California is the hawk-moth (_Pholus achemon_), the\r\nlarvæ of which occasionally do serious damage to small areas of vines.\r\nThese larvæ are very similar to the large worms, familiar to all,\r\nwhich attack the tomato and tobacco. The insect hibernates in the\r\npupal state in the ground where it may be distinguished as a large\r\ncylindrical object of dark brown color. The moths emerge about the\r\nmiddle of May and deposit their eggs on the leaves of the grape, upon\r\nwhich the larvæ when hatched immediately begin to feed. There are\r\nseveral species of these hawk-moths, all of which have essentially the\r\nsame life history. It is not a difficult pest to control since the\r\nlarvæ are easily killed with arsenical sprays; or if there are but\r\noccasional specimens they may be picked by hand. There are several\r\nspecies of the hawk-moth which attack the grape but this is the common\r\none.\r\n\r\nIn eastern grape-growing regions, there are two other destructive\r\ngrape insects widely distributed, but each noteworthy as pests only in\r\nthe Appalachian region of West Virginia and neighboring states. One is\r\nthe grape-curculio (_Craponius inæqualis_), not essentially different\r\nfrom the familiar curculio of the plum and cherry. This snout-beetle\r\nfeeds freely on the upper surface of the leaves and the bark of fruit\r\nstems, and the female in laying eggs devours the tissues of the grapes\r\nin excavating her egg chamber. The grape-curculio is effectively\r\ndestroyed by spraying with an arsenical spray in the spring as the\r\nbeetles appear on the vines and before egg-laying begins.\r\n\r\nAnother insect pest of this region is the grape-vine root-borer\r\n(_Memythrus polistiformis_) closely allied to the peach-borer, known\r\nby all fruit-growers and the squash-vine borer known to the growers of\r\nvegetables. This borer is the larva of a moth and is a whitish grub\r\nwith a brown head which, when fully grown, is about one and\r\nthree-quarters inches in length. The body is slender, distinctly\r\nsegmented and has a sparse covering of short, stiff hairs. These\r\nlarvæ burrow into the grape-root, at first confining themselves to the\r\nsofter portions of the bark, often encircling the root several times,\r\nbut later bore with the grain of the wood and by the end of the season\r\nso destroy the roots as to leave only the thin membrane of the outer\r\nbark intact. This pest is difficult to deal with. The borers cannot be\r\nremoved by \"worming\" as in the peach, and neither can the roots be\r\nprotected by sprays or washes. No one variety of the grape seems more\r\nimmune than another. Thorough cultivation in the months of June and\r\nJuly to destroy the insects while in their cocoons at the surface of\r\nthe ground seems to be the only method of stopping their ravages, and\r\nthis is not always effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGOUS DISEASES OF THE GRAPE\r\n\r\nThe grape is ravaged by four or five fungous diseases in America,\r\nunless the utmost vigilance is exercised to keep the parasites in\r\ncheck. Happily for commercial viticulture, there are regions, as we\r\nhave seen in the description of grape regions in Chapter I, so\r\nfortunate in their freedom from fungous diseases that there is little\r\nuncertainty in grape-growing and but small expense in controlling\r\ndiseases. Also modern science has discovered the life history of all\r\nthe important diseases and devised fairly effective means of combating\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll of the fungous parasites of the grape in America are indigenous,\r\nhaving long subsisted on wild vines. They are, therefore, all widely\r\ndistributed, and as cultivation has presented to them great numbers of\r\ngrape plants in continuous areas, the diseases have increased rapidly\r\nin intensity, at times have swept like wildfire through grape regions\r\ndevastating and utterly ruining great areas of vines. Means, however,\r\nare now at hand in remedial and preventive treatment, which, while\r\nbecause of cost may not permit the grapes to be grown profitably in\r\nall parts of America, do permit their culture for home use in\r\npractically all agricultural districts in the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVII.--Empire State (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n_Black-rot._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. Work of black-rot of the grape.]\r\n\r\nThis is the most widely distributed and the most destructive fungous\r\ndisease of the grape in the region east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\nFortunately, it is unknown on the Pacific coast. The disease is caused\r\nby a parasitic fungus (_Guignardia Bidwellii_) which gains entrance to\r\nthe grape plant by means of minute spores distributed chiefly by wind\r\nand rain. Black-rot passes the winter in mummied grapes, on dead\r\ntendrils or on small, dead areas on the canes. In the spring, the\r\nfungus spreads from these spots to the leaves and forms brown leaf\r\nspots about a fourth of an inch in diameter, or oblong, black spots on\r\nthe shoots, leaves, petioles and tendrils. Later the disease spreads\r\nto the fruits, not usually attracting attention until the berries are\r\nat least half grown. Soon after the ravages of the fungus become\r\napparent on the berries, the fruits turn black, shrivel and become\r\ncovered with minute black pustules which contain the summer-spores.\r\nFigure 44 shows the work of black-rot. In the winter and spring,\r\nanother form called the winter- or resting-spore is produced upon\r\nthese old, shriveled, mummied berries, and these carry the disease\r\nover from one season to another.\r\n\r\nSince the disease is carried through the winter in mummied fruits and\r\ndiseased wood, the desirability of destroying these mummied grapes and\r\nthe leaves and prunings of infected vines as soon as possible is\r\napparent. This treatment, however, is not sufficient, and the disease\r\ncan be effectually controlled only by thorough spraying with bordeaux\r\nmixture (4-4-50). The first application should be made just before the\r\ngrape blossoms; the second, shortly after blossoming. The amount of\r\nmaterial applied matters less than evenness in distribution and\r\nfineness of the spray as applied. In rainy seasons, perhaps a third or\r\na fourth application should be made in regions where the disease is\r\nserious; the third is made when the berries are the size of a pea; the\r\nfourth, as the berries become large enough to touch each other.\r\n\r\n_Downy-mildew._\r\n\r\nDowny-mildew (_Plasmopara viticola_) rivals black-rot for first place\r\namong fungous diseases of the grape. It is found in all grape regions\r\neast of the Rocky Mountains but does most harm in northern localities.\r\nLike black-rot, downy-mildew attacks all the tender growing parts of\r\nthe vine, but is chiefly found on the foliage and is usually less\r\ndestructive than black-rot. As first seen on the foliage, the work of\r\nthe fungus appears as greenish-yellow, irregular spots upon the upper\r\nsurface which later become reddish-brown. At the same time on the\r\nunder surface of the leaf, a thin, white downy growth puts forth. The\r\nspores of the fungus are produced on this downy growth, and under\r\nfavorable conditions are distributed by wind and water to all tender\r\nparts of the vine, where they germinate and begin their work of\r\ndestruction. The fruit is attacked when partly grown, as shown in Fig.\r\n45, becoming covered with the gray down of the fungus, the \"gray-rot\"\r\nof the grape-grower. If the berries escape the disease until half\r\ngrown, the fungus causes a brownish-purple spot that soon covers the\r\nwhole grape, giving the disease at this stage the name of \"brown-rot.\"\r\nBesides the summer-spores, another form of reproductive bodies is\r\nproduced in the winter to carry the fungus through the resting period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45. Grapes attacked by downy-mildew.]\r\n\r\nDowny-mildew, like black-rot, spreads most rapidly and does most\r\ninjury in hot, wet weather. As with practically all diseases of the\r\ngrape, much can be accomplished in the way of control of the disease\r\nby destroying infested leaves, shoots and berries which contain the\r\nwinter spores, but these sanitary measures are not sufficiently\r\neffective and vineyards must be sprayed as recommended for black-rot,\r\nexcept that the first application should be made before the\r\nblossom-buds appear.\r\n\r\n_Powdery-mildew._\r\n\r\nLess troublesome than downy-mildew in the East, powdery-mildew\r\n(_Uncinula necator_), unless checked, is capable of destroying the\r\nentire crop of European grapes on the Pacific slope. In the East it\r\nsometimes causes great loss on the several varieties known as \"Rogers\r\nhybrids\" and, curiously enough, is often a rather serious disease of\r\nthe Concord. The disease is caused by a superficial fungus which\r\npasses the winter on fallen leaves and also on the canes. The spores\r\nbegin to germinate a few weeks after the grape blossoms, but the\r\ndisease is not often found until the grapes are nearly half grown. The\r\nfine white filaments of the fungus, which constitute the vegetative\r\nportion of the parasite, then attack the leaves, shoots and fruit,\r\nsending up short irregular branches on which great numbers of spores\r\nare borne. These give the upper surface of the leaf a gray, powdery\r\nappearance, hence the name. Eventually the diseased leaves become\r\nlight brown and if the disease is severe, soon fall. Infected berries\r\ntake on a gray, scurfy appearance, speckled with brown, are checked in\r\ngrowth and often burst on one side, exposing the seeds. The berries,\r\nhowever, do not become soft and shrunken as when attacked by the\r\ndowny-mildew. The disease passes the winter in resting-spores produced\r\nlate in the growing season. Powdery-mildew differs from other fungous\r\ndiseases of the grape in being more prevalent in hot, dry seasons than\r\nin cold, wet ones.\r\n\r\nIn eastern America powdery-mildew is controlled by the treatment\r\nrecommended for black-rot. When black-rot is not prevalent, two sprays\r\nwith bordeaux mixture are recommended; the first in early July and the\r\nsecond about two weeks later. On the Pacific coast, however,\r\npowdery-mildew or \"oïdium\" as it is often called there, the name\r\ncoming from Europe, is more cheaply and more successfully combated by\r\ndusting with flowers of sulfur. Dusting is often done by hand or with\r\nperforated cans but this is wasteful and uncertain, and any one of\r\nseveral sulfur-sprayers may be used which does the work better.\r\n\r\n_Anthracnose._\r\n\r\nAnother widespread disease is anthracnose (_Sphaceloma ampelinum_),\r\ncalled \"birds-eye-rot\" because of the peculiar spots produced on the\r\naffected fruits, which attacks leaves, shoots and fruits of the vine.\r\nIt first appears on the leaves in small, irregular, dark brown sunken\r\nspots with a dark margin. Later it appears on the fruits, having much\r\nthe same appearance though the spots are usually larger and more\r\nsunken, the disease being most characteristic on the fruit, however.\r\nFrequently two or more spots unite and so cover the greater part of\r\nthe berry. The fruits become hard, more or less wrinkled, and the\r\ndiseased area often ruptures, exposing the seed, much as with\r\npowdery-mildew. The spores of the fungus are produced in great numbers\r\non diseased areas during the growing season and are borne on\r\nthread-like filaments which live throughout the winter in the tissues\r\nof the vine and are ready for new growth in the spring. Winter-spores\r\nhave not yet been discovered.\r\n\r\nAnthracnose is widely distributed in eastern America but seldom causes\r\ngreat or general loss, most of the commercial grapes being relatively\r\nimmune to the disease. A few sorts rather commonly grown in home\r\nvineyards, as Diamond, Brighton and Agawam, suffer most from\r\nanthracnose. Spraying with bordeaux mixture, as recommended for\r\nblack-rot, is usually sufficient to keep the disease in check.\r\n\r\n_Dead-arm disease._\r\n\r\nA troublesome disease of recent appearance is now doing considerable\r\ndamage in the Chautauqua grape-belt along the shores of Lake Erie,\r\nbeing most common on the Concord. From the fact that it is usually\r\nfound on one arm of the vine it is called \"dead-arm disease\"\r\n(_Cryptosporella viticola_.) The disease is caused by a fungus which\r\npasses the winter in small, black fruiting bodies in the dead parts of\r\nthe vine. Early in the spring the fungus spreads by means of spores to\r\nthe young shoots and later in the season attacks mature berries,\r\nproducing small, black, oblong spots of black-rot. Sooner or later, if\r\nthe diseased shoot is not cut off, the fungus spreads to the arms or\r\ntrunk of the vine, producing a slow, dry rot which eventually kills\r\nthe affected part. Fortunately, the presence of the disease is quickly\r\ndetected by small yellowish leaves, much crimped about the margin.\r\n\r\nThe fungus is easily controlled by marking the diseased arms when the\r\nfirst symptoms appear and cutting these off at pruning time. If the\r\nvine is much mutilated by such pruning, usually suckers can be brought\r\nup from beneath the surface of the ground to renew the vine. The\r\napplications of bordeaux mixture recommended for black-rot are\r\nvaluable in preventing the dead-arm disease. The disease is largely\r\nprevented by renewing the old wood of the vine as soon as the trunk\r\nbegins to show a gnarled appearance.\r\n\r\n_Shelling._\r\n\r\nIn eastern America, especially in the Chautauqua grape-belt,\r\ngrape-growers not infrequently lose a large part of the crop by the\r\npremature falling of the grapes from the stems. The trouble is an\r\nancient one and is designated as \"shelling\" or \"rattling.\" This\r\npremature dropping usually begins at the end of a cluster, and\r\nclusters farthest from the trunk are earliest affected. When vineyards\r\nsuffer badly from this shelling, the vines often take on a sickly\r\nappearance, the foliage falling off in color and the outer margins of\r\nthe leaves drying up more or less. The fallen fruit has an insipid\r\ntaste and is, of course, worthless even if it could be harvested.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the trouble is not known. Grapes may \"rattle\" on high\r\nland or low land, on poor soil or rich soil, on heavy or light soil. A\r\nvineyard may be affected one year and not the next. Grape-growers\r\nusually attribute the trouble to faulty nutrition, but applications of\r\nfertilizers have not proved a preventive. Old and well-established\r\nvineyards seem freer from the trouble than new and poorly established\r\nplantings. The most reasonable theory as to the cause of shelling is\r\nthat it comes from faulty nutrition of the vine, but the conditions so\r\naffecting the nutrition are not yet satisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\n_Diseases of minor importance._\r\n\r\nRipe-rot or bitter-rot (_Glomerella rufomaculans_) is a disease due to\r\nthe same fungus causing the bitter-rot of the apple. As the name\r\nindicates, the disease usually appears on the fruit at ripening time\r\nand under favorable conditions continues after the grapes are picked.\r\nIt may also attack the leaves and stems. The first indication of the\r\nfungus is the appearance of reddish-brown spots which spread and\r\neventually cover the whole fruit. The berries do not shrivel, but the\r\nrotted surface becomes dotted with pustules in which the spores are\r\nborne. It is hard to tell how much damage this disease does, but it is\r\nnot usually great and the late applications of bordeaux mixture for\r\nblack-rot or powdery-mildew are very effective in controlling it.\r\n\r\nCrown-gall, now known to be a bacterial disease which causes knots or\r\ngalls on the roots of various wild and cultivated plants, sometimes\r\nattacks grape roots or even the vines above ground. Occasionally, the\r\ndisease is rather serious, but it is not often to be reckoned with in\r\nthe vineyard regions of America. Fungicides are useless in combating\r\nthe disease and all that can be done is to exercise great care in\r\nplanting infected stock. It is doubtful whether crown-gall ever\r\nseriously injures vines in northern regions, although it may\r\noccasionally do so in the South.\r\n\r\nIn California there is a somewhat mysterious disease known as \"Anaheim\r\ndisease,\" because of its having first made its appearance in the\r\nvicinity of Anaheim. As near as can be learned, the disease first\r\nappeared in 1884 and then spread rapidly from forty to fifty miles\r\nfrom the point where it began its ravages, causing direct and indirect\r\nloss of many millions of dollars, and leading to the abandonment of\r\ngrape-growing in some parts of southern California. Fortunately, in\r\nrecent years the Anaheim disease is less aggressive but still does\r\nmore or less damage. The nature and the treatment of this disease are\r\nnot as yet fully determined, although several experimenters are\r\nstudying the trouble. Californians whose vineyards suffer from this\r\ndisease should apply to the experiment station at Berkeley for the\r\nlatest information in regard to it.\r\n\r\nCoulure is another trouble of the vine in California of which little\r\nis yet known, either as to cause or treatment. The term signifies the\r\nfailure of the fruit to set or to remain on the clusters. The trouble\r\noccurs in varying degrees from the loss of a few berries to the\r\ncomplete shelling of the fruit from the stem. It is worse in some\r\nlocalities than others and in some varieties than others. Various\r\ncauses have been assigned to the disease, chief of which, and most\r\nprobable, are unfavorable climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROL OF INSECTS AND DISEASES\r\n\r\nFrom the number of insects and diseases found on the grape, it would\r\nseem that, literally, \"pestilence walketh in darkness and destruction\r\nwasteth at noonday\" in the vineyards of the country. But not many of\r\nthe ills that grape-flesh is heir to are ever found in one region, and\r\nthe vineyard is seldom attacked by many diseases or insects in a\r\nsingle season. There was a time, as we have said before, when\r\ngrape-growers were so beset by pests which they could not control,\r\nthat viticulture was one of the most uncertain fields in agriculture.\r\nBut one brilliant discovery after another has brought the pests of the\r\ngrape under the hand of man until now there are but few that need\r\ncause much expense in treatment or worry as to the outcome.\r\n\r\nPlants cannot be attacked by diseases unless infection is permitted.\r\nIt follows that by proper sanitation most of the insect pests of the\r\nvine can be kept out of the vineyard.\r\n\r\n_Vineyard sanitation._\r\n\r\nBy changing or modifying environment, immunity can be secured from\r\nmany of the pests of the grape and damage may be reduced with most if\r\nnot all. Cultivation, as has been noted under several insect pests and\r\none or two of the diseases of the grape, is an effective method of\r\neliminating grape pests. In the case of insects, it destroys the\r\ninsects themselves and the hibernating places as well. The vineyard\r\nshould never be kept in sod, but always under thorough and frequent\r\ncultivation. Vineyard sanitation is greatly improved, also, if\r\ncover-crops which remain green during the winter are planted after the\r\nlast cultivation. Cultivation should usually be preceded by deep\r\nplowing in the fall or spring to turn under fallen leaves and weeds or\r\ngrass in which hibernating insects may pass the winter.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of the vineyard should be looked after. Fence-rows\r\nand waste lands which cannot be cultivated may often be burned over to\r\ndestroy the hibernating places of grape insects. As a rule, it is\r\nunwise to plant the bramble berries or even strawberries in\r\nvineyards, or adjoining vineyards, since these plants afford\r\nhibernating places and food plants for some of the grape insects,\r\nespecially the destructive leaf-hopper. Lastly, precaution should be\r\ntaken by destroying all wild grape-vines near vineyards, as these\r\nfrequently harbor insects and diseases, the flea-beetle finding the\r\nwild grape-vine almost a necessity to its existence.\r\n\r\n_Spraying._\r\n\r\nDefinite rules cannot be laid down for spraying vineyards the country\r\nover. The literature on this subject is plentiful in any state in\r\nwhich grapes are largely grown, within the reach of the grape-grower,\r\nand is not difficult to understand once it is in hand. Every\r\ngrape-grower should secure and study the publications of the state\r\nexperiment stations having to do with the control of insects and\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThe number of applications and the sprays to be used vary greatly in\r\ndifferent parts of America. On the Pacific slope the only application\r\nyearly required in most vineyard regions is dusting with flowers of\r\nsulfur for powdery-mildew. Several other pests may, however, from year\r\nto year, or in one locality or another, require special treatment. In\r\nthe grape regions of New York, many grape-growers do not spray at all,\r\nbut these are usually slovens or procrastinators whose profits are\r\nsmall and uncertain. In the grape regions of the northeastern states,\r\norderly vineyardists spray at least once with bordeaux mixture\r\n(4-4-50) in which is put three pounds of arsenate of lead, no matter\r\nhow few insects and fungi are present. This treatment is given soon\r\nafter the blossoms fall. In more southern regions it may be necessary\r\nto make a similar treatment soon after the first leaves appear, again\r\nafter the blossoms fall and every two weeks thereafter until the\r\ngrapes begin to turn in color, making as many as four, five or even\r\nsix applications in all. To these regular applications of bordeaux\r\nmixture and arsenate of lead, contact insecticides, as some of the\r\nnicotine preparations, may have to be added; or, for special purposes\r\nas specified in discussing the several pests, cheap molasses is added.\r\nIt is doubtful, however, whether the grape can be grown with\r\ncommercial success where insects and fungi prevail and are so\r\npestiferous as to require annually more than two or three applications\r\nof spraying mixtures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XVIII.--Herbert (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMARKETING THE CROPS AND VINEYARD RETURNS\r\n\r\n\r\nViticulture, as all divisions of agriculture, is made up of two quite\r\ndistinct phases of activity: growing the crop and marketing the crop.\r\nThe subjects to be treated in this and the next chapter belong rather\r\nmore to marketing than to cultural activities. Treated in detail,\r\nthese operations constitute matter sufficient for a separate treatise,\r\nand only an outline of present practices is in place in a text such as\r\nthis devoted to the culture of the fruit. The several operations to be\r\ndiscussed are picking, packing, storing, shipping and marketing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING IN THE EAST AND NORTH\r\n\r\nAs the consummation of the care of the vine, the in-gathering of the\r\ncrop is celebrated in all European countries with rejoicings in song,\r\ndance and mirth. In America the vintage is less of an event than in\r\nEurope, but it is more picturesque and diverting than the harvest of\r\nmost other crops. It is work in which youth and old age, as well as\r\nthose in the prime of life in both sexes, can take part and is reputed\r\nas a most healthful occupation. For these reasons, the grape harvest\r\nin America, as in Europe, has somewhat the air of a holiday, so that\r\nworkers are usually readily found for the several operations of\r\nharvesting. Laborers come as grapes begin to ripen from near-by cities\r\nand towns and neighboring country-sides in such numbers that the care\r\nof the crop is speedily accomplished.\r\n\r\n_Pickers._\r\n\r\nAs a rule, pickers are hired by the piece rather than by the day,\r\nexperience having demonstrated that so paid they do more and better\r\nwork. There is usually much diversity in race, age and condition of\r\nlife of pickers so that harmonious and efficient work is scarcely\r\npossible without a competent foreman in charge who must often be\r\nassisted by a sub-foreman. Efficient supervision doubles the picking\r\ncapacity of a gang of workers, and, moreover, is necessary to see that\r\nthe fruit is picked and packed with proper care. In hiring pickers, it\r\nis usually stipulated that a part of the pay is to be reserved until\r\nthe close of the season; otherwise those disposed to have a holiday\r\nleave when the weather becomes unpleasant or seek greener pastures\r\nwhen the grapes become scarce.\r\n\r\n_Time to pick._\r\n\r\nUnlike some fruits, grapes must not be picked until they are fully\r\nripe, as unripe grapes do not mature after picking. Grapes not matured\r\nlack the necessary percentage of sugar and solids to keep well and\r\nhave not developed their full flavor. Many growers make the mistake of\r\nsending grapes to the market before fully ripe, a mistake easily made\r\nwith some varieties because they acquire full color before full\r\nmaturity. Color, therefore, is not a good guide as to the time to\r\npick. In the northern and eastern states, late varieties of grapes may\r\nbe allowed to hang on the vines for some little time after maturity,\r\nthe late autumn suns giving them a higher degree of sweetness and\r\nperfection. Some growers run the risks of light frosts to further\r\nmaturity and to secure the added advantage of the removal of many\r\nleaves from the vines. Ripeness is indicated by a combination of signs\r\ndifficult to describe but easily learned by experience. These signs\r\nare: first, a characteristic color; second, full development of flavor\r\nand aroma; third, a softer texture of the pulp and a slight\r\nthickening of the juice so that it is more or less sticky; fourth, the\r\nends of the stems turn from green to brown; fifth, the berries pull\r\nmore readily from their stems; sixth, the seeds are free or more\r\nnearly free from the pulp and usually turn from green to brown.\r\n\r\n_Picking appliances._\r\n\r\nBut few appliances are needed in picking grapes. Shears are a\r\nnecessity. These are of special make and can be bought from dealers in\r\nhorticultural supplies, costing from 75 cents to $1. Some growers,\r\nafter picking, pack the fruit in the field in the receptacles in which\r\nit is to go to market. The greater number, however, pick in trays\r\nwhich are taken to the packing-house and allowed to stand until the\r\nfruit is wilted before packing for shipment. Trays may be of several\r\nsizes and shapes, but are usually shallow flats holding from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-five pounds. The picked fruit is taken from the\r\nvineyard to the packing-shed in a wagon with flexible springs to\r\nprevent jarring and jolting. Large growers usually have specially\r\nbuilt one-horse platform wagons, the front wheels of which pass under\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\n_Picking accounts._\r\n\r\nIt is no small matter to keep a picking account with pickers.\r\nBusiness-like growers use one of several kinds of tickets or tags in\r\nkeeping accounts. Probably the most common method is to give a ticket\r\nto the picker when the receptacle of grapes is delivered, the grower\r\neither keeping half of the original or a duplicate of it. Objections\r\nto ticket systems are that the pickers often lose the tickets, are\r\nirregular in returning them, or exchange them with other pickers. To\r\nobviate the disadvantages of tickets, some growers use tags which bear\r\nthe picker's name and are attached to his person. These tags have\r\nmarginal numbers or divisions which are canceled by a punch as\r\npickers deliver the grapes. Still another method is to keep book\r\naccounts with each picker in which case payment is made by the pound,\r\neach receptacle being put on the scales as brought in from the field,\r\ncredit being given for the number of pounds. It is the duty of those\r\nin charge to see that each picker finishes the row or the part of the\r\nrow to which he is assigned, and that he does not wander over the\r\nvineyard in search of the best picking.\r\n\r\n_Packing-houses and their appliances._\r\n\r\nThe commercial grape-grower must have a house for packing and storing.\r\nHouses differ in design and fitting for almost every vineyard.\r\nSometimes the house is a combination one for packing and storing.\r\nOften the packing-house is a halfway place between the vineyard and\r\nthe shipping station, in which case it is an open shed or a lightly\r\nconstructed building. In these field packing-houses there are usually\r\nno provisions for storing. The better types of combined houses are\r\nprovided with a cellar for the storage of grapes, the first floor is\r\nused for packing, and the attic provides a place for the storage of\r\nbaskets and crates. In all such houses provision must be made for\r\nthorough ventilation, especially for the storage cellar if the grapes\r\nare to be kept for any length of time. Properly ventilated, the\r\ntemperature of the grape cellar can be kept as low as 50° F. during\r\nSeptember and October. The cellar floor in these houses is usually of\r\ndirt better to regulate the moisture-content of the room. Often the\r\nfirst floor is divided into two rooms, one to be used for\r\npacking and the other as a shipping room. A good combination\r\npacking-and-storage-house of this type can be built for $1000 to\r\n$2000. Now that cold storage facilities can be secured in most\r\ngrape-growing regions, and the rates of storage are becoming more\r\nreasonable, there is less need of storage-houses.\r\n\r\nPacking-houses are so simple in construction and may be so different\r\nin design that it is neither possible nor necessary to describe them\r\nin detail. A building that protects the workers from the elements and\r\naffords conveniences in packing serves the purpose. Such a\r\npacking-house, which is often located in the vineyard, should be well\r\nlighted, should be connected with the storage-room for baskets and\r\nshould have advantages for delivering the packages from the\r\nstorage-room to the packing-room and from the packing-room to the\r\nshipping-room. Its size will depend on the quantities of grapes to be\r\npacked. The house must be built so that it can be kept clean and\r\nsweet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46. Packing grapes on a packing-table.]\r\n\r\nEvery packing-house, whatever the design, must be furnished with\r\ntables for holding the trays while the fruit is being packed. Usually\r\nthese tables are so made that the picking trays are set before the\r\npackers on an inclined table. The packer transfers the grapes from the\r\ntrays into the baskets in which the fruit is to be sold. The trays of\r\ngrapes as they come from the field are set before the worker, who then\r\npacks the fruit into the basket from the left. As the baskets are\r\nfilled, they are placed on a flat ledge or shelf in front of the\r\npacker and are then taken off by an attendant. Empty baskets are\r\nusually held in store on a higher shelf convenient to the packer and\r\nfrom time to time are replenished by the attendant. Figure 46 shows a\r\npacking-table of the kind just described. Sometimes the packing-table\r\nis circular and revolves, the packers sitting about the table. The\r\nbaskets are held on the lap and the packer takes the grapes off the\r\ntable which is turned as fresh fruit is brought in. This circular\r\ntable is not in general use; its only advantage is that it permits the\r\npacker to select from a larger quantity of fruit.\r\n\r\n_Grading grapes._\r\n\r\nGrapes are more easily graded than most other fruits; for usually\r\nthere are but two grades, firsts and culls. It is difficult to specify\r\nexactly what firsts are, since a number of factors must be considered\r\nwhich bring in play the judgment of the grader. At least, firsts must\r\nhave the following qualities: The bunches must be approximately\r\nuniform in size; there must be few or no berries missing from the\r\nstems; the grapes must be fully ripe, of a uniform degree of ripeness\r\nand uniformly colored; and the fruit must be free from insect and\r\nfungous injuries. It is easier to give specifications for culls, since\r\nall grapes not firsts are culls.\r\n\r\nIn large vineyards, only good fruit or the best fruit is worth\r\ngrading. It is more advisable to sell poor fruit by the ton with\r\nlittle or no grading. It follows, also, that the higher the price, the\r\nmore special the market, and the more carefully the crop is picked,\r\nthe more profitable it is to grade. The work of grading is done in the\r\npacking-shed when the fruit is transferred from the trays into the\r\nselling receptacles. A pair of slender scissors made for the purpose,\r\nto be purchased from dealers in horticultural supplies, is used to\r\ntrim out diseased and crushed berries. The fruit must be permitted to\r\nwilt for a few hours, a half day or overnight, before it can be graded\r\nto advantage. In this work of grading, the greatest care should be\r\ntaken to keep the fruit clean and fresh, to sort out broken bunches\r\nand to preserve the bloom. The less handling, the more finely finished\r\nis the product.\r\n\r\n_Grape packages in eastern grape regions._\r\n\r\nPackages for grapes are less varied than those for any other fruit,\r\nselling receptacles in the states east of the Rocky Mountains being\r\nmuch the same for all regions. Dessert grapes are universally packed\r\nin gift packages--that is, packages which are given away when the\r\nfruit is sold--and this insures a clean dainty package. It seems\r\nimperative that a uniform style of package should be used the country\r\nover for the general market, but up until this time, although there\r\nhave been both national and state laws passed, uniformity has not been\r\nsecured. A national law is needed establishing standard commercial\r\npackages so that the grower may safely ship from one state to another\r\nwithout being a law-breaker. Such a package should be based on\r\ncubic-measure and not on weight as is often advocated; for grapes\r\ncannot be shipped without some loss from sampling in transit; and\r\nthere are also losses in weight by evaporation so that the grower,\r\nalthough trying to comply with the law, may become technically a\r\nlaw-breaker if the standard is based on weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47. Climax baskets in two sizes.]\r\n\r\nThe most popular package for the grape in eastern grape regions is the\r\nClimax basket made in various styles and sizes. These are cheap,\r\neasily packed and handled, nest well in shipment and are durable.\r\nThree sizes are commonest in use, the five-pound, the ten-pound and\r\nthe twenty-pound basket. The five-pound basket usually holds only a\r\nlittle over four pounds; the ten-pound about eight pounds; and the\r\ntwenty-pound rather less than twenty pounds. Two sizes of Climax\r\nbaskets are shown in Fig. 47. It is commonly understood, however, that\r\nthe packages are short in weight, and as grapes are retailed by the\r\nbasket and not by the pound, short weight does not really deceive.\r\n\r\nThese baskets are made of thin wood veneer with a light wood binding\r\nat the top and bottom. The cover is of wood and is usually fastened on\r\nwith staples. The handle is either of wood or of wire. When well made,\r\nthe baskets are firm and symmetrical, without splinters and are clean\r\nand white. Packages carried over from year to year become dingy in\r\ncolor, but the wood may be whitened by fumigating in the storage-room\r\nwith sulfur. The baskets also become yellow and discolored if left in\r\nthe sun and must, therefore, be stored in clean, dark, dry rooms.\r\n\r\nWhen grapes are sold by weight to manufacturers of wine or\r\ngrape-juice, they are usually delivered in the picking trays which, if\r\nthe market is near at hand, are always returned. If they are to be\r\nshipped far, they go to market in twenty-pound baskets or bushel\r\nbaskets, although the latter are not regarded with favor by consumers.\r\n\r\n_Packing._\r\n\r\nGrapes packed indoors, as has been said, are allowed to stand from a\r\nfew to twenty-four hours after being picked to permit them to wilt.\r\nWhen thus wilted they are much more easily packed and do not shrink in\r\ntransportation, so that the basket usually reaches the market well\r\nfilled with fruit. Each bunch of grapes is placed separately in the\r\nbasket after all unmarketable berries have been removed. The bunches\r\nare arranged in concentric tiers, the top layer being placed with\r\nspecial care. When the basket is filled, the grapes rise a little\r\nabove the level of the basket, care being taken not to have the fruit\r\nproject too much so that the grapes will be crushed when putting on\r\nthe cover. In all this work, the berries are handled as little as\r\npossible, so as not to destroy the bloom. Care is taken, also, that\r\nthe fruit is free from spraying material and is otherwise clean and\r\nfresh. Much less pains need be taken when the grapes are packed in\r\ntrays to be sold by weight, but even in this there must be method in\r\nfilling the trays, otherwise there will be many open spaces and\r\ncorners between bunches.\r\n\r\nPractically all commercial grape-growers now use labels on their\r\npackages. These not only add to the attractiveness of the packages,\r\nbut are a guarantee of the contents, both as to name of the variety\r\nand the quality of the fruit. These labels are, also, a sign by which\r\na grower's fruit may be distinguished and are, therefore, a valuable\r\nadvertising medium. Some growers have registered their labels in the\r\nUnited States Patent Office in order to prevent others from using\r\nthem. Obviously, it is not desirable or worth while to label a poor\r\ngrade of grapes.\r\n\r\n_Storing grapes._\r\n\r\nThe commercial grape-grower now stores his grapes in cold storage\r\nwarehouses if he keeps them any length of time after harvesting. There\r\nis no question but that keeping a part of the crop in artificially\r\ncooled houses is a great benefit to the grape-grower, since it\r\nprolongs the season for selling by some three or four months.\r\nFormerly, native grapes could be secured in general markets only until\r\nThanksgiving time or thereabouts, but now American grapes are very\r\ngenerally offered for sale in January and February, while the European\r\ngrapes from California are in the market nearly the year around. The\r\ngrape-grower need make little or no preparation of his product in\r\nputting it in cold storage except to make sure that the product is\r\nfirst class in every respect. It would be a waste of money and effort\r\nto attempt to store any but clean, sound, well-matured, well-packed\r\ngrapes. The grape-grower, however, seldom need concern himself with\r\nstoring, since the crop is usually stored by the buyers.\r\n\r\nFew small growers seem to have learned the art of keeping grapes in\r\ncommon storage, There are but few difficulties in keeping European\r\ngrapes for several months after picking if they are stored under\r\nfavorable conditions. Not all, but several of the native grapes may\r\nalso be kept practically throughout the winter if proper precautions\r\nare taken. Among these varieties Catawba is the standard winter sort,\r\nbut Diana, Iona, Isabella, Rogers' hybrids and Vergennes, all rather\r\ncommonly grown, may be kept by the small grower.\r\n\r\nTo insure keeping, these native grapes must be handled most carefully.\r\nThe fruit is picked a few days before it is dead ripe and the bunches\r\nplaced in trays holding forty or fifty pounds. It is important that\r\nthe temperature be reduced gradually so that there are no sudden\r\nchanges. If the nights are cool, a valuable aid is to leave the grapes\r\nout-of-doors in crates the night after they are picked, placing them\r\nin a cool building or dry cellar early the next morning. The cellar or\r\nstore-room should be well ventilated and should be such that the\r\ntemperature is not variable, care being taken that the air in every\r\npart of the storage room is changed. Draughts, however, should be\r\navoided or stems and berries will shrivel. If a temperature from 40°\r\nto 50° can be maintained, the varieties named may be kept until March\r\nor April. An expensive store-room is not necessary and ice to cool the\r\nroom is not only unnecessary but undesirable.\r\n\r\nIf the storage-room is too dry, the grapes wilt and lose flavor; if,\r\non the other hand, the atmosphere is too damp, the grapes mold. It is\r\nessential, therefore, to strike a medium between an atmosphere too dry\r\nand one too wet. It is possible that a light fumigation with sulfur or\r\nformaldehyde might help to keep down molds in these common storage\r\ngrape-rooms, but as to the value of fumigation there seems to be no\r\nexperimental evidence.\r\n\r\nGrapes grown on clay lands are said to be firmer and to keep better\r\nthan those grown on gravel or lighter soils. Some years ago there was\r\nan association in Ohio known as The Clay-Growers Association which\r\nhandled only grapes grown on clay lands. The members of this\r\nassociation believed that their grapes were much more desirable for\r\nstorage than grapes from regions where the soil was lighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTING AND HANDLING MUSCADINE GRAPES\r\n\r\nThe Muscadine grapes of the South Atlantic and Gulf states are unique\r\nin vine and fruit, are used for different purposes and go to different\r\nmarkets from the grapes of the North, so that they may be considered\r\nalmost a distinct fruit. Not only are cultural requirements peculiar\r\nto this fruit, as we have seen, but the methods of harvesting and\r\nmarketing are quite distinct. These are well set forth by Husmann and\r\nDearing[18] as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Rotundifolia vines have been almost entirely grown on overhead arbors\r\nin the past, the fruit being made into wine, and under such conditions\r\nthe general practice of jarring the grapes from the vines is perhaps\r\nthe most practical method of harvesting. If the vines are trained to\r\nupright trellises or if the fruit is intended for shipping or table\r\nuse the grapes should be picked by hand in order to be sound and\r\nclean. On account of the presence of leaves, twigs, etc., mixed with\r\nthe grapes jarred from the vines, wine and grape-juice manufacturers\r\nwill pay 5 to 15 cents a bushel more for hand-picked grapes. The\r\ngrowers who make a practice of hand picking claim that the work can be\r\ndone at practically no greater expense than is necessary to shake off\r\nand clean a crop, and the increased price obtained for the fruit will\r\nmore than pay the difference.\r\n\r\n\"A description of the harvesting of the Rotundifolia grapes by the\r\njarring method will be interesting to those not familiar with it.\r\nPoles are attached to sheets of canvas measuring 6 by 12 feet and\r\nhaving leather handles. A man is placed at each end of the sheets and\r\nfour men with two sheets work together. The wide sides of the two\r\nsheets are brought close together under each vine, with the trunk of\r\nthe vine in the middle. The vines are then jarred, the berries falling\r\ninto the sheets. Those not caught by the sheets or that have fallen to\r\nthe ground by the shaking of the trellis when the fruit of the\r\nadjoining vines was harvested, etc., and which are usually of the best\r\nquality, are picked by hand. The writers are informed that it costs\r\napproximately 15 cents a bushel to harvest the fruit on the ground and\r\n12 cents to harvest that which falls on the sheets.\r\n\r\n\"The fruit is put in boxes or barrels, and if the quantity is not\r\nlarge the leaves, sticks, etc., which become mixed with the fruit are\r\nremoved by hand. If there is a considerable quantity of fruit some\r\nmechanical means, such as ordinary grain fan mills, are used to clean\r\nit. After cleaning, the fruit is hauled or shipped to the winery. In\r\nwineries with modern equipment there are blowers which thoroughly\r\nclean the fruit. These are located near the end of the elevators that\r\ncarry the fruit to the crusher.\r\n\r\n\"A common and very objectionable practice followed in harvesting\r\nRotundifolia grapes, especially by the jarring method, is that of\r\ngathering the fruit all at once, whereas there should be at least\r\nthree periods of harvesting. When harvested at one time the best\r\nquality of fruit ripens, falls to the ground, and is lost before the\r\nharvest is commenced and the last part of the crop is thrashed from\r\nthe vines in a half-ripe condition along with the ripe fruit. In this\r\nmanner not only is the first and best fruit entirely lost, but the\r\nharvested fruit is inferior in quality, which necessarily results in a\r\npoor product from the entire yield.\"\r\n\r\n_Returns from Muscadine grapes._\r\n\r\n\"Great variations occur in the yields from Rotundifolia vines. At\r\ntimes there are record-breaking yields and, again, small yields are\r\nreported, the small yields resulting from black-rot, coulure, wet\r\nweather, self-sterility, lack of cultivation, fertilization, lack of\r\npruning, age of vines, and various other causes. In spite of this,\r\nRotundifolia vines are said to be among the safest and most prolific\r\nof fruit-bearing plants. While in one of the largest Rotundifolia\r\nvineyards there has been only a partial crop during the last three\r\nyears, owing to various causes, another grower reports a yield of 177\r\nbushels of grapes from 4-year-old James vines, in addition to a bale\r\nof cotton to the acre. A Florida grower estimated his crop of white\r\nRotundifolia and Thomas grapes for the season of 1911 at 280 bushels\r\nto the acre. An average yield of 27 bushels an acre from 4-year-old\r\nvines, 100 bushels from 5-year-old vines, and 150 bushels to the acre\r\nwhen the vines are in full bearing should be obtained.\r\n\r\n\"The prices paid for Rotundifolia grapes depend on the season, the\r\nquality of fruit, and the market. In years when the crop is short\r\nbetter prices are usually paid than when there is a heavy crop. Aside\r\nfrom the grapes sold and shipped to wineries, grapes as a rule sell\r\nfor more in the cities and larger towns than in smaller places, the\r\nlocal demand being somewhat in proportion to the population. In such\r\nlocalities fruit of good quality will bring a much better price than\r\ninferior fruit. Hand-picked fruit in half-bushel peach baskets or in\r\nberry boxes usually brings from $1 to $2 per bushel. Grapes harvested\r\nby jarring are usually sent to the wineries and bring an average of 75\r\ncents per bushel of 60 pounds. The highest price paid for this quality\r\nof fruit was reached in 1910, when $2.25 per bushel (f.o.b. shipping\r\npoint) was paid for white Rotundifolia.\r\n\r\n\"In many localities certain growers have built up quite a reputation\r\nfor themselves in choice, hand-picked fruit, which they ship to\r\nspecial customers in distant markets. For this purpose the James\r\nvariety is usually grown because the berries adhere well and are of\r\ngood size and flavor. Several growers ship as far north as New York\r\nand Boston, getting from $2.00 to $2.50 gross per bushel crate. In\r\nshipping, three styles of carriers are used--the 24-box strawberry\r\ncrate, the 6-basket peach crate, and the 8-pound basket. More\r\nattention should be given to this phase of the industry. The varieties\r\nbest suited for shipping are the James, Memory, Flowers, and Mish.\r\n\r\n\"In the fall of 1910 shipments of the James, Thomas, and Eden\r\nvarieties were sent from the Rotundifolia experiment vineyard at\r\nWillard, N. C., to Washington D. C., part of the consignment being in\r\nstrawberry boxes and the remainder in bushel baskets. No important\r\ndifference could be noted in the two lots on their arrival in\r\nWashington. The James variety arrived in perfect condition in both\r\npackages; of the Eden 30 per cent and of the Thomas 35 per cent had\r\nshelled. More extensive experiments along this line are contemplated.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING THE GRAPE IN CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nGrapes are grown in California for three purposes, wine, raisins and\r\nthe table. The handling of the crop for raisins and wine is best taken\r\nup in a discussion of these products in the chapter on by-products of\r\nthe grape, leaving only table grapes to be discussed at this place.\r\n\r\nThe table-grape industry of the Pacific slope is dependent on the wide\r\ndistribution of the product in eastern markets for a profitable sale\r\nof the crop, since production is so great that but a small part of the\r\ncrop is consumed in the markets of the Pacific slope. The growers in\r\nthis region, therefore, have special problems, chief of which are\r\nthose of successful shipment over long distances. California annually\r\nships in the neighborhood of 10,000 carloads of table grapes, all of\r\nwhich must be handled within a period of about two months. As\r\ncompetition increases, it becomes more and more necessary to extend\r\nthe area over which the fruit is to be sold; to lengthen the marketing\r\nseason through cold storage; and for both of these purposes to devise\r\nnew or to improve present methods of handling the fruit. The two\r\nrequisites for the successful shipment of this great bulk of grapes\r\nare: The fruit must reach the markets in sound condition; and it must\r\nhave sufficient market-holding quality to remain sound for a\r\nconsiderable length of time after it arrives in the markets.\r\nExperience has thoroughly demonstrated to grape-growers in California\r\nthat decay in grapes is largely dependent on the presence of injuries\r\nto the grape berries, to the pedicels or to the stems of the bunches.\r\nMethods of handling grapes, therefore, and the type of package used,\r\nmust be such that the product is injured as little as possible.\r\n\r\n_Careful handling._\r\n\r\nIn the shipment of European grapes from California, it has been found\r\nthat it pays to go to much extra trouble in handling the crop. The\r\nbunches are picked with care to avoid bruising or crushing berries,\r\nand as far as possible they are lifted only by the main stems. They\r\nare then laid with care in the picking trays which are filled only one\r\nlayer deep. In moving the trays to the packing-house, they are handled\r\ncarefully, the trays being moved only on wagons with springs. In\r\nsorting, special care is taken to remove all injured and unsound\r\nberries and not to injure others in the bunch, here again handling the\r\nclusters by the stems. In packing, the bunches are placed firmly in\r\nthe baskets with care not to crush or bruise the stems or to injure\r\nthe pedicels of the berries. A slight injury of either berry or\r\npedicel permits the spores of the fungus causing decay to gain\r\nentrance into the fruit.\r\n\r\n_Shipping packages._\r\n\r\nThe most common package for table-grapes in California is a square\r\nbasket holding about five pounds. These baskets are placed for\r\nshipment in fours in crates. The bunches of some varieties may be too\r\nlarge for these small baskets, and these extra large-clustered grapes\r\nare packed in oblong baskets holding in the neighborhood of eight\r\npounds, two baskets filling a crate. No good filler seems yet to have\r\nbeen devised for packing grapes in California. The cork dust in which\r\ngrapes from the Mediterranean are received is not available and a good\r\nsubstitute has not yet been found. Sawdust is sometimes used but has\r\nnot proved satisfactory in holding the decay and the fruit absorbs\r\ndisagreeable flavors from the wood. Occasionally, however, grapes from\r\nCalifornia are sent to eastern markets packed in dry redwood sawdust\r\nand these seem to come through in good condition and not to have\r\nabsorbed a disagreeable flavor. Reports seem to indicate that this\r\nspecially selected redwood sawdust is proving much better than the\r\nordinary sawdust experimented with some years ago.\r\n\r\n_Shipping._\r\n\r\nConsiderable work has been done by the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture to determine how table-grapes could best be shipped from\r\nthe far West and reach the eastern markets in good condition. The crop\r\nis, of course, shipped in refrigerator cars and much depends on the\r\ncooling of these cars and especially on the temperature at which the\r\ngrapes are kept while in transit. To carry well over the 3000 miles of\r\nmountain and desert, heat and cold, the best type of refrigerator car\r\nmust be used. It does not appear that the pre-cooling so advantageous\r\nto citrous and other tree-fruits is worth the trouble and expense with\r\ntable-grapes, as it does not seem to prevent decay. Cooling cannot be\r\nsubstituted for careful handling, which seems as yet the most\r\nnecessary precaution to be taken in the preparation of these grapes\r\nfor eastern shipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKETING\r\n\r\nTable-grapes from both eastern and western grape regions are now\r\nalmost entirely shipped in carload lots. Since few grape-growers are\r\nprepared to load a car quickly with grapes, some kind of coöperation\r\nis required, or the crop must be handled by large buyers. Coöperative\r\nmethods are becoming more and more popular, although a large part of\r\nthe grape crop, both East and West, is now handled by buyers.\r\n\r\nThere are several important advantages in selling through a\r\ncoöperative organization. Thus, in selling coöperatively, the grapes\r\nare graded and packed in accordance with one standard; more favorable\r\ntransportation rates can be secured by a coöperative association; and,\r\nmost important of all, the output can be distributed to the grape\r\nmarkets of the country without the disastrous competition that attends\r\nindividual marketing. In some of these organizations, also, supplies\r\nneeded by the grape-grower in producing a crop are purchased more\r\neconomically than by individuals; in particular, grape packages can be\r\npurchased better by an organization than by an individual.\r\n\r\nAs the grape industry and competition grow in the different regions of\r\nthe country, the necessity of forming marketing organizations becomes\r\ngreater. Such organizations must be founded on the principles which\r\nmany experiments have shown best govern fruit-marketing associations.\r\nIt is not possible to discuss these principles at length, but the\r\nfollowing fundamentals will suffice:\r\n\r\nAn ideal coöperative association is one in which there are no profits\r\nnor dividends. Every member of the whole organized association is a\r\nproducer. All of the product grown by a member is sold through the\r\nassociation. The association is democratic, all members having an\r\nequal voice in its management and all sharing alike in its successes\r\nand failures. When profits arise of necessity, they are distributed to\r\nthe members of the association in proportion to the amount of business\r\neach has done. The work of the organization is conducted at as near\r\ncost as possible and profits are declared only after expenses,\r\ndepreciation, interest on capital for future operations are deducted.\r\nThus it is seen that the plan of the organization is to give each\r\nmember as nearly as possible the exact price his fruit has brought in\r\nthe markets.\r\n\r\n\r\nVINEYARD RETURNS\r\n\r\nGrape-growing as a business is a comparatively new industry in\r\nAmerica. It is true that the first attempts at growing this fruit were\r\nmade to found an industry, but these were complete and dismal\r\nfailures, and the start in growing grapes in America eventually came\r\nas a pleasing hobby. In evolving from a hobby into vineyard culture on\r\na large scale, the business side of the industry long lagged. At\r\npresent, with increasing competition, manifold uncertainties in\r\nvineyard conditions, and much unbusinesslike administration, interest\r\nin cultural operations, with which pioneers in the industry were\r\nchiefly concerned, is eclipsed by the conception that grape-growing is\r\na highly developed commercial enterprise requiring for success careful\r\nbusiness management.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately there is nowhere a substantial body of figures from\r\nwhich growers can obtain a fair conception of what the outgo and\r\nincome of average vineyards in grape regions are. The value of such\r\ndata to investors or to those making an effort to keep track of the\r\nfinances of their business is obvious, and an attempt is made here to\r\nput the reader in possession of figures that ought to be helpful. The\r\ndata given, although scant and fragmentary, show fairly accurately the\r\ncost of producing grapes, selling prices and profits in the culture\r\nof this fruit in one of the great grape regions.\r\n\r\nThe New York Agricultural Experiment Station is carrying on\r\nexperiments to determine the outgo and income from vineyards in the\r\nChautauqua grape-belt. The work is not yet finished, nor could the\r\nfindings be published in detail before being sent out by the Station,\r\nbut F. E. Gladwin, in charge of the work, has consented to set down\r\nsummaries of costs and returns taken from vineyards at Fredonia, which\r\nwill serve as a guide to planters of grapes in this region at least:\r\n\r\n    _First Year_\r\n\r\n    Interest on value of land @ $200 per acre                   $12.00\r\n    Preparation of land                                           8.00\r\n    Cost of vines per acre                                       12.00\r\n    Planting                                                      4.00\r\n    Cultivating                                                   6.00\r\n                                                                ------\r\n      Total expenditure for first year                          $42.00\r\n\r\n    _Second Year_\r\n\r\n    Interest on value of vineyard @ $225 per acre               $13.50\r\n    Cultivating, hand hoeing, etc.                                9.25\r\n    Pruning                                                       1.00\r\n                                                                ------\r\n      Total expenditure for second year                         $23.75\r\n\r\n    _Third Year_\r\n\r\n    Interest on value of vineyard @ $250 per acre               $15.00\r\n    Pruning                                                       2.50\r\n    Posts (cost of) @ .10 240                                    24.00\r\n    Setting and driving                                           6.50\r\n    Wire and wiring, staples, etc.                               11.65\r\n    Tying and twine                                               1.45\r\n    Cultivating, plowing, harrowing                               9.25\r\n    Spraying                                                      4.00\r\n    No. baskets sold @ .16 per basket 500                $80.00\r\n    Cost of baskets @ $20 per thousand                           10.00\r\n    Picking @ .01 per basket                                      5.00\r\n    Packing @ .01 per basket                                      5.00\r\n    Hauling .003                                                  1.50\r\n                                                                ------\r\n      Outgo for third year                                      $95.85\r\n                                                         ------\r\n    Income                                               $80.00\r\n\r\n    _Fourth Year_\r\n\r\n    Interest on value of vineyard @ $300 per acre               $18.00\r\n    Pruning                                                       2.50\r\n    Tying                                                         2.90\r\n    Spraying and materials                                        4.00\r\n    Cultivating, plowing, harrowing, hand-hoeing and\r\n    plowing back one furrow                                       9.25\r\n    Trellis upkeep, driving posts, tightening wires, etc.         2.50\r\n    Pulling and poling out brush                                  1.69\r\n    No. baskets sold @ .16 per basket 1000              $160.00\r\n    Cost of baskets @ $20 per thousand                           20.00\r\n    Picking @ .01 per basket                                     10.00\r\n    Packing @ .01 per basket                                     10.00\r\n    Hauling .003                                                  3.00\r\n                                                                ------\r\n      Outgo for fourth year                                     $83.84\r\n                                                        -------\r\n    Income                                              $160.00\r\n\r\n    Outgo for four years                                $245.44\r\n    Income for four years                                240.00\r\n\r\n    _Estimates for Succeeding Years_\r\n\r\n    Gross income                                       $125-200\r\n    Outgo                                                75- 85\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XIX.--Iona (×3/5).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nGRAPE PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOver-production, with the attendant losses caused by glutted markets,\r\nis a factor which, like frosts and freezes, is ever in the mind of the\r\ngrape-grower. No season passes but that some of the grape regions of\r\nthe country suffer from over-production. Not uncommonly the grape\r\nindustry in a region is better off in a season when the crop is small\r\nand prices high, than when the crop is large and prices low. In every\r\npart of the country where grapes are grown, over-production has been a\r\ngreat deterrent to viticulture; this, in spite of the fact that\r\ngrape-growers have availed themselves of the opportunity to\r\nmanufacture products from this fruit. Thus, wine and raisins are made\r\nfrom the grape in California, and a large part of the harvest in the\r\nEast goes into wine, champagne and grape-juice. But the growth of\r\nprohibition now threatens the wine and champagne industries of the\r\ncountry, in fact may be said to have driven them to the wall, making\r\nthe need of new outlets in manufactured products a greater necessity.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, grape-growers must seek in every way to\r\nenlarge the sale of the crop to manufacturers with the hope that thus,\r\ntogether with more perfect distribution of his commodities, the\r\ninroads made by prohibition on the industry may be offset and the\r\nover-production of table-grapes be better prevented. With this brief\r\nemphasis on the importance of manufactured products of the grape, we\r\napproach the discussion of the several possible outlets to\r\nover-production in this fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINE\r\n\r\nThe manufacture and use of wine in America, as has been intimated, is\r\nlikely to cease through prohibition. Therefore, whatever may be said\r\nof this product of the grape is of less and less interest to\r\ngrape-growers. However, a few years of grace probably remain for the\r\nmaking of wines in America, and since wine-making yet offers the\r\ngreatest outlet for the grape crop, next to table-grapes, wine must be\r\nconsidered as a factor in the grape industry.\r\n\r\nSince the demand and price for grapes depend very largely on the kind\r\nof wine to be made, it is necessary to characterize the wines made in\r\nAmerica. Wine, it should be said, is the product of alcoholic\r\nfermentation of the grape. Alcoholic fermentations made from other\r\nfruits are not, strictly speaking, wines. Natural wines are divided\r\ninto three broad groups; dry, sweet and sparkling wines. Dry wines are\r\nthose in which sugar has been eliminated by fermentation; sweet wines\r\nthose in which sufficient sugar remains to give a sweet taste; and\r\nsparkling wines are those which contain sufficient carbonic acid gas\r\nto give a pressure of several atmospheres in the bottle. The carbonic\r\nacid gas is produced in sparkling wines by fermentation in the bottle\r\nof a dry wine.\r\n\r\nThe color in these three classes of wine may be red or white,\r\ndepending on whether or not the color is extracted from the skins in\r\nthe process of fermentation. To make red wine, of course, the grapes\r\nto be fermented must have red coloring matter in skin or juice or\r\nboth. Each of these groups of wine includes a very large number of\r\nkinds distinguished by the name of the region, the locality or the\r\nname of the vineyard in which a wine is made. Wines are still further\r\ndistinguished according to the year of the vintage.\r\n\r\n_Wine-making._\r\n\r\nThere are four distinct stages in the making of wine after the grapes\r\nare grown. The first is the harvesting of the grapes when they have\r\nreached the proper stage of maturity, which is known as \"wine-making\r\nripeness.\" This stage of ripeness is determined by means of a\r\nmust-scale or saccharometer. The wine-maker squeezes the juice from a\r\nnumber of bunches of grapes into a receptacle into which he drops the\r\nmust-scale, whereupon the sugar-content of the juice is indicated on\r\nthe scale, determining whether the proper stage of ripeness has been\r\nreached. Suitable varieties of grapes having been grown, it is\r\nnecessary that they be permitted to hang on the vine until the proper\r\ndegree of ripeness is developed, after which they are delivered at the\r\nwinery as free as possible from injury or decay.\r\n\r\nThe second stage is the preparation of the grapes for fermentation.\r\nThe grapes are weighed on arriving at the winery and are then conveyed\r\neither by hand or more often by a mechanical conveyor to the hopper or\r\ncrusher. The ancient method of crushing, which still prevails in some\r\nparts of Europe, was to tramp the grapes with bare feet or wooden\r\nshoes. Tramping has been superseded by mechanical crushers which break\r\nthe skin but do not crush the seeds. The best mechanical crushers\r\nconsist of two-grooved revolving cylinders. As the grapes pass through\r\nthe crusher, they fall into the stemmer, a machine which tears off the\r\nstems, discharging them at one end, while the seeds, skins, pulp and\r\njuice pass through the bottom to the presses usually on the floor\r\nbelow. There are several types of wine-presses, all of which, however,\r\nare modifications of screw, hydraulic or knuckle-joint power. In large\r\nwineries, the hydraulic press has almost driven out the other two\r\nforms of power and when great quantities of grapes must be handled a\r\nnumber of hydraulic presses are usually in operation. The grape\r\npomace is built up into a \"cheese\" by the use of cloths and racks\r\nvariously arranged. The \"cheese\" is then put under heavy pressure from\r\nwhich the juice or \"must\" is quickly extracted.\r\n\r\nThe third stage is fermentation. The \"must\" is carried from the press\r\ninto open tanks or vats which hold from 500 to 5000 gallons or even\r\nmore. The yeast cells which cause fermentation may be introduced\r\nnaturally on the skins of the grapes; or in many modern wineries the\r\n\"must\" is sterilized to rid it of undesirable micro-organisms and a\r\n\"starter\" of \"wine-yeast\" is added to start the fermentation. Yeast\r\norganisms attack the sugar and must, breaking it up into alcohol and\r\ncarbonic acid gas, the latter passing off as it is formed. When active\r\nfermentation ceases, the new wine is drawn from the pomace and is put\r\ninto closed casks or tanks where it undergoes a secondary\r\nfermentation, much sediment settling at the bottom of the cask. To rid\r\nthe new wine of this sediment, it must be drawn off into clean casks,\r\nan operation called \"racking.\" The first racking usually takes place\r\nwithin a month or six weeks. A second racking is necessary at the end\r\nof the winter and a third is desirable in the summer or fall.\r\n\r\nThe fourth stage is the aging of the wine. Before aging begins,\r\nhowever, the wine usually must be rendered perfectly clear and bright\r\nby \"fining.\" The materials used in fining are isinglass, white of egg\r\nor gelatine. These, introduced into the wine, cause undissolved\r\nmatters to precipitate. The wine is now ready for bottling or\r\nconsumption. Most wines acquire a more desirable flavor through\r\n\"aging,\" a slow oxidation in the bottles.\r\n\r\n_Champagne._\r\n\r\nWhen champagne wines have gone through their first fermentation, they\r\nare racked off into casks to age until their quality can be\r\nascertained, after which a blend of several different wines is made.\r\nThis blend is called the \"cuvée.\" The cuvée is bottled and a second\r\nfermentation starts. The bottles are now put in cool cellars, corded\r\nin horizontal layers with thin strips of wood between each layer of\r\nbottles. The champagne in this stage is said to be in \"tirage.\" The\r\ncarbonic acid gas generated at this second fermentation is confined in\r\nthe bottles and absorbed by the wine. When the bottle is uncorked, the\r\ngas, seeking to escape, produces the sparkling effect desirable in\r\nsparkling wines. After the wine has been in tirage for one or two\r\nyears, the bottles are placed in A-shaped racks, the neck of the\r\nbottle pointing downward so that the sediment formed during\r\nfermentation drops to the cork. To further the settling of the\r\nsediment, workmen turn or shake each bottle daily for a period of one\r\nto three months. The bottles are then taken to the finishing room,\r\ncork down and the wine is \"disgorged.\" Disgorging is accomplished by\r\nfreezing a small quantity of wine in the neck of the bottle containing\r\nthe sediment, after which the cork is removed and with it the frozen\r\nsediment. The bottle is refilled, recorked, wired, capped, and the\r\nchampagne is ready for shipment.\r\n\r\n_The vintage._\r\n\r\nThe wine-making season the world over is known as the \"vintage.\" The\r\ntime at which the vintage begins depends, of course, on the region,\r\nthe variety of grapes, the growing season and the location of the\r\nvineyard. Its duration, also, depends on these same factors. The\r\nseason is usually lengthened by the fact that wine-makers require for\r\ntheir purposes a number of varieties of grapes which ripen at\r\ndifferent times. Before or during the vintage, representatives of wine\r\ncellars usually make contracts for the number of tons of grapes\r\nrequired at a certain price a ton.\r\n\r\nThe notion prevails that grapes for wine and grape-juice need not be\r\nfirst-class. This is far from the truth. To make good wine the grapes\r\nmust be carefully harvested, transported with as little injury as\r\npossible and must be protected from dirt, mold and fermentation before\r\nreaching the winery. European vintagers maintain that grapes picked at\r\nsunrise produce the lightest and most limped wines and yield more\r\njuice. They say, also, that the grapes should not be gathered in the\r\nheat of the day because fermentation sets in at once. These niceties\r\nare not observed in America.\r\n\r\n_Prices paid for wine grapes._\r\n\r\nSupply and demand regulate the price paid for wine grapes. There is\r\nalways demand for good wine grapes, although a poor product often goes\r\nbegging for market. In the East, the highest prices are paid for the\r\ngrapes used in making champagne. The champagne region of the East is\r\nconfined to a few localities along Lake Erie and to western New York\r\nabout Keuka Lake, where the industry is most largely developed. The\r\nvarieties used in champagne-making in the East are Delaware, Catawba,\r\nElvira, Dutchess, Iona, Diamond and a few other sorts. Prices differ\r\nwith the many conditions affecting the grape and champagne industries,\r\nperhaps the average price for Catawba, the grape chiefly used in\r\nmaking champagne in this region, being from $40 to $50 a ton. Choicer\r\ngrapes, as Delaware, Iona and Dutchess, often sell from $75 to $100 a\r\nton. Concords are sometimes utilized in making dry wines in the\r\neastern states, $30 or $40 a ton being the average price. Ives and\r\nNorton are much used for red wines and sell for top prices.\r\n\r\nWine-makers in the East are at a disadvantage in producing wines other\r\nthan champagne, since the price paid on the Pacific slope for wine\r\ngrapes is much lower; Grapes for sweet wine in California often sell\r\nas low as $6 or $7 a ton, the average price being $10 or $12. Grapes\r\nfor dry wines, such as Zinfandel and Burger, bring on the Pacific\r\ncoast from $10 to $12 a ton. Choice varieties of grapes in this\r\nregion, such as Cabernet, Sauvignon, Petite Sirah and Riesling, bring\r\nfrom $22 to $24. The eastern wine-makers, however, have the advantage\r\nof being close to the largest and best markets in the country. Wines\r\nmade in the East are very different from those made in California and\r\nsupply a different market.\r\n\r\nA few years ago most of the Muscadine grapes grown in the South were\r\nused for wine-making. From these grapes wine has been made since\r\ncolonial times, and for a century there have been some large vineyards\r\nof Muscadine grapes in the South from which wine was made in a\r\ncommercial way. Since Muscadine grapes do not sell well in the markets\r\nin competition with the grapes of the North or the Pacific slope, the\r\nMuscadine grape industry has been dependent on the wine industry of\r\nthe section in which the fruit is produced. The growth of prohibition\r\nin the South, however, has driven the wine industry to the North and\r\nWest and there is now little wine manufactured from Muscadine grapes\r\nin the South, although some grapes are shipped North for wine-making.\r\nThe wine made from these grapes is very distinct in flavor and on that\r\naccount a special trade has been developed for it. It is possible that\r\nthis special trade will keep up the demand for Muscadine wine so that\r\nsome part of the crop may be shipped to wine-making states to supply\r\nthis demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPE-JUICE\r\n\r\nWhen properly made, grape-juice is the undiluted, unsweetened,\r\nunfermented juice of the grape and contains no preservatives,\r\nfermentation being prevented by sterilization with heat. The product\r\nis as ancient as wine, and, therefore, as the cultivation of the vine,\r\nfor all wine-making peoples have used new wine or grape-juice as a\r\nbeverage. For centuries physicians in wine-making countries have\r\nprescribed grape-juice as it comes from the wine-press for certain\r\nmaladies, the treatment constituting an essential part of the\r\ngrape-cures of European countries. The process of making an\r\nunfermented grape-juice that will keep from season to season as an\r\narticle of commerce is, however, a modern invention, and is the\r\noutcome of the discoveries of the last half century regarding the\r\ncontrol of the agents of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of commercial grape-juice in America, to which country\r\nthe industry is confined, began as a home practice following the\r\nfundamental processes of canning fruit. Toward the close of the last\r\ncentury, several inventive minds discovered methods of making a\r\ncommercial product and began developing markets for their wares. The\r\nbeginning of the present century found the new industry in full swing,\r\nsince which time its growth has been truly marvelous. In 1900 the\r\namount of grape-juice made in the United States was so small as to be\r\nnegligible in the census report of that year. By 1910, the annual\r\noutput had reached for the whole country over 1,500,000 gallons and at\r\npresent writing, 1918, it is well above 3,500,000 gallons per annum.\r\nThe manufacture of grape-juice is no longer a home industry but a\r\ngreat commercial enterprise. It is an industry closely associated with\r\ngrape-growing, however, and as such needs further consideration here.\r\n\r\n_Grape-juice regions._\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of grape-juice is centered in the Chautauqua\r\ngrape-belt in New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. So far, the demand\r\nseems to be almost wholly for juices made from native grapes, the\r\njuice of European grapes grown on the Pacific slope being so sweet as\r\nto be insipid. Possibly 80 per cent of the grape-juice now\r\nmanufactured in America comes from a single variety, the Concord.\r\nThere can be no question, however, but that sooner or later\r\ngrape-juices of distinct qualities will be made from many varieties of\r\ngrapes, thus giving wider sale and greater variation for the product.\r\nA very good sparkling grape-juice is now on the market and its\r\nreception seems to promise a great increase in the production of an\r\narticle that closely simulates champagne in color and sparkling\r\nvivacity, but not, of course, in taste, since it contains no alcohol.\r\nThe grape-juice industry has been started and is in a flourishing\r\ncondition in several other grape regions than the Chautauqua belt\r\nwhich is now its center. There are factories at Sandusky, Ohio, using\r\ngrapes grown in the Kelly Island district; in southwestern Michigan\r\nthere are several factories; and the industry still survives at\r\nVineland, New Jersey, which probably should be called the original\r\nhome of the manufacture of grape-juice. In the South, some grape-juice\r\nis made from Muscadine grapes, but this product seems not as yet to\r\nhave been well received in the markets.\r\n\r\n_Commercial methods of making grape-juice._\r\n\r\nThere is at present a great diversity of methods and of apparatus\r\nemployed in the grape-juice manufacturing plants throughout the\r\ncountry. Since the industry is in its infancy, and the attempt has\r\nbeen made to hold some of the methods as trade secrets, the diversity\r\nof methods and appliances is not to be wondered at. No doubt there\r\nwill be greater uniformity of method and machinery and, therefore,\r\ngreater efficiency, as the industry develops.\r\n\r\nHusmann[19] gives the following account of the manufacture of\r\ngrape-juice in the eastern states and in California:\r\n\r\n\"Sound, ripe, but not over-ripe, grapes are used. These are first\r\ncrushed or, in case the stems are to be removed, are run through a\r\ncombined stemmer and crusher. If the machinery is stationed high\r\nenough, the crushed fruit can be run through chutes directly into the\r\npresses or kettles; otherwise, it must be pumped into them by means of\r\na pomace or must pump or carried in pomace carts or tubs.\r\n\r\n\"If a white or light colored juice is desired, the crushed grapes are\r\nfirst pressed, the juice which comes from the press being heated to\r\nabout 165° F., skimmed, run through a pasteurizer at a temperature of\r\nbetween 175° and 200° F. into well-sterilized containers, and then\r\nplaced in storage.\r\n\r\n\"If a colored juice is desired, the crushed grapes are heated\r\nimmediately, usually in aluminum kettles having double bottoms, which\r\nprevent the steam from coming in contact with the contents. These\r\nkettles usually contain revolving cylinders, the arms of which keep\r\nthe crushed grapes thoroughly stirred while they are being heated to\r\nabout 140° F. The simultaneous heating and stirring help to extract\r\nthe coloring matter from the skins, tear the cells of the berries,\r\nincrease the quantity of juice obtained per ton of fruit, and give to\r\nthe must many ingredients of red wine, with the substitution of grape\r\nsugar for alcohol of the wine.\r\n\r\n\"The aluminum kettles are filled and emptied in rotation, thereby\r\nmaking continuous manipulation possible. The presses should be\r\nsituated below the kettles, so that the hot juice can be drained\r\ndirectly into them. The expressed juice is then reheated to about 165°\r\nF., skimmed, and run through the pasteurizer in the same manner in\r\nwhich the white juice is handled. The juice passes from the\r\npasteurizer while still hot (about 160° F.) into the container, which\r\nshould be sealed immediately. The lower the temperature (above the\r\nfreezing point) at which these containers are then stored, the less is\r\nthe danger of fermentation and the more rapidly the juice will clear\r\nand deposit its sediment.\r\n\r\n\"The ordinary receptacles in which the juice is stored are 5-gallon\r\ndemijohns, 20-gallon carboys, or clean, new barrels or puncheons, well\r\nwashed and drained. All containers should be thoroughly sterilized\r\nbefore they are filled, and the covers, corks, bungs, cloths, etc.,\r\nused in sealing them should be scrupulously clean and carefully\r\nsterilized. If barrels or puncheons are used as containers, they are\r\nplaced on skids and firmly wedged to prevent movement. As the juice\r\ncools, air laden with fermentation germs is apt to be drawn into the\r\nbarrels by the decrease in the volume of the liquid. In order to\r\nprevent this, tight air-filtering plugs of sterilized cotton are\r\nsometimes used instead of the ordinary bungs of solid wood.\r\n\r\n\"The type of pasteurizer differs in almost every establishment. As the\r\nindustry is of comparatively recent development commercially, there\r\nare few models on the market and each manufacturer has constructed the\r\nmodel best suited to his particular ideas or requirements. There are\r\ntwo general types, however, (1) open, double-bottomed kettles in which\r\nthe juice is heated to the required temperature and then drawn off,\r\nand (2) continuous pasteurizers in which the juice is heated to the\r\nrequired temperature as it passes through the water bath.\r\n\r\n\"The presses also show great variation in different establishments,\r\neither hydraulic, screw or lever power being used, and there is a\r\nmarked difference between the types of pomace containers. Sometimes\r\nthe crushed grapes are heaped on burlap cloths the sides of which are\r\nfolded in, and these burlaps are placed one on top of the other in the\r\npress; sometimes press baskets take the place of these burlaps.\r\n\r\n\"The manufacturers in California and those in the grape-growing\r\nregions of the Rocky Mountains seem to have adopted entirely different\r\nmethods of handling the juice after it is first pasteurized and\r\nstored. Most of the eastern juices are red and are obtained from the\r\nLabrusca varieties, generally the Concord. When the juice comes from\r\nthe presses, some manufacturers strain it to remove the coarse\r\nparticles and then pour it directly into well-sterilized bottles;\r\nothers siphon it off the sediment in the containers in which it is\r\nstored after the first pasteurization and pour it into pasteurized\r\nbottles. In either case, the bottles are securely corked and then\r\nrepasteurized. The California juices, however, both red and white, are\r\nmade exclusively from Vinifera varieties. They are allowed to settle\r\nin the original containers and are siphoned out of these and carefully\r\nfiltered to make them clear and bright.\r\n\r\n\"The clearing of the juice is sometimes facilitated by fining or\r\nadding a small quantity of a substance which coagulates and when\r\nsettling carries down with it the solid matters causing cloudiness in\r\nthe liquid. Such finings may be applied at the time of the first\r\npasteurization or just before the final filtration and bottling. In\r\nthe latter case the juice is drawn off the settlings in containers,\r\nthe finings are added, and the juice again pasteurized into other\r\nreceptacles. When it clears, it is either bottled directly or first\r\npassed through a filter, drawn into carefully sterilized bottles,\r\nsecurely corked, and then repasteurized. Care must be taken that the\r\nfinal sterilization is not at a higher temperature than the previous\r\none; otherwise, solid matter may be precipitated and the must clouded\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"A simple and efficient form of sterilizer consists of a wooden trough\r\nprovided with a wooden grating which is raised 2 inches from the\r\nbottom and on which rest the filled bottles in wire baskets. The\r\ntrough contains enough water to submerge the bottles and is kept at a\r\ntemperature of 185° F. by means of a steam coil beneath the grating.\r\nIt requires about 15 minutes for the must at the bottom of the bottles\r\nto reach that temperature; for packages of other sizes it is necessary\r\nto make a test with a thermometer in order to determine how long it\r\ntakes for the entire contents to reach 185°.\r\n\r\n\"To prevent the corks from being expelled during sterilization, they\r\nare either tied down with a strong twine or with some contrivance such\r\nas the cork holder. In order that mold germs may not enter the must\r\nthrough the corks, especially if a poor quality of cork is used, the\r\nnecks of the corked bottles are dipped in heated paraffin before\r\nputting on the caps, or the corks are sealed down with sealing wax. It\r\nis also well to keep the bottles on their rider to prevent the corks\r\ndrying out.\"\r\n\r\n_Home methods of making grape-juice._\r\n\r\nThe principles involved in making grape-juice in the home are the same\r\nas those used in canning. The grapes may be crushed by hand or in\r\nmills similar or identical with the small cider-mills owned by many\r\nfarmers. In making a light-colored juice, the crushed grapes are put\r\nin a cloth sack and hung up to drain, or the filled sack may be\r\ntwisted by two persons until the greater part of the juice is\r\nexpressed. The juice is then sterilized in a double-boiler by heating\r\nit at a temperature of 180° to 200° F., care being taken that the\r\nthermometer never goes above 200°. The sterilized juice is now poured\r\ninto a glass or enameled vessel to stand for twenty-four hours, after\r\nwhich it is drained from the sediment and strained through several\r\nthicknesses of clean flannel. The juice is now put in clean bottles\r\npreparatory to a second sterilization, care being taken that at least\r\nan inch of space is left at the top for the liquid to expand when\r\nheated. The second sterilization may be conducted in a wash-boiler or\r\nsimilar receptacle. The filled bottles must not rest on the bottom of\r\nthe boiler but should be separated from it with a thin board. The\r\nboiler is filled with water up to within an inch of the tops of the\r\nbottles and heated until the water begins to boil. The bottles should\r\nthen be taken out and corked immediately, using only new corks. After\r\ncorking, the bottles are further sealed by dipping the corks in melted\r\nparaffin. A cheap corking machine is a great convenience in this work,\r\nand in any case the corks should be soaked for at least a half hour in\r\nwarm but not boiling water.\r\n\r\nThe process varies somewhat in the making of red grape-juice. The\r\ncrushed grapes are heated to a temperature of 200° F., and are then\r\nstrained through a drip bag without pressure, after which the liquid\r\nis set away in glass or enamel vessels to settle for twenty-four\r\nhours. Except for this difference in the preliminary treatment of the\r\njuice, the methods are the same in making the red or the light-colored\r\nproduct. For proper keeping it is not necessary to let the juice\r\nsettle after it is strained, but a clearer and brighter product is\r\nobtained if the juice is permitted to settle. In either case the\r\ngrape-juice should keep indefinitely if the work has been well done.\r\nAs soon as bottles are opened, fermentation begins with the formation\r\nof alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAISINS\r\n\r\nThe grape is best conserved as a raisin. Canning is seldom practiced\r\nwith this fruit. A raisin is a dried grape. Tree-fruits are evaporated\r\nas by-products, but the raisin is a primary product. This is a\r\ndifference worth noting; for with tree-fruits the cream of the crop\r\ngoes to the fresh fruit market, while with the grape the entire crop\r\nof raisin varieties may go into the cured product. The raisin industry\r\nis dependent on a sunny and rainless climate and hence in America is\r\nconfined to the grape regions of certain parts of California. In this\r\nstate, raisin-making is a rich resource of the grape-grower, the\r\nannual output now averaging well above 200,000 pounds, grown on\r\n120,000 acres of land, and having a market value of $10,000,000.\r\nFresno County, California, produces nearly 60 per cent of the output\r\nof the state and the city of Fresno is the center of the industry. The\r\nraisin industry does not stand alone in California, as some raisin\r\ngrapes, notably Muscat of Alexandria, are good dessert sorts and are\r\nalso much used for wine and brandy. Only the first crop of the variety\r\nnamed is used for raisins, while practically all of the second crop\r\neach season is made into wine and brandy.\r\n\r\nRaisins proper are mostly made from the Muscat of Alexandria, although\r\nother large, white, sweet grapes are sometimes used. Sultana raisins,\r\nnaturally seedless, are made from Sultanina and the Sultana. The dried\r\ncurrants of commerce are made from grapes, and of these California\r\nproduces small quantities from White Corinth.\r\n\r\nThe following account of raisin-making is given by Husmann:[20]\r\n\r\n\"In the raisin districts grapes are ripe by the middle of August, the\r\nseason often lasting into November. The average time necessary for\r\ndrying and curing a tray of raisins is about three weeks, depending on\r\nthe weather, the earliest picked grapes drying in ten days and the\r\nlater ones often taking four weeks or more.\r\n\r\n\"The method of drying is very simple. The bunches are cut from the\r\nvines and placed in shallow trays 2 feet wide, 3 feet long, and 1 inch\r\nhigh on which the grapes are allowed to sun-dry, being turned from\r\ntime to time by simply placing an empty tray upside down on the full\r\none and then turning both over and taking off the top tray. After the\r\nraisins are dried they are stored away until they are packed and\r\nprepared for shipment. Some of the larger growers, in order not to run\r\nso much risk in drying on account of rain, and also to enable them to\r\nhandle the crop fast enough, have curing houses, where the curing is\r\nfinished after having been partially done outside.\"\r\n\r\n_Dipping and scalding raisins._\r\n\r\n\"The operation of dipping and scalding is designed to accomplish\r\nseveral purposes, namely, to cleanse the fruit, to hasten its drying,\r\nand to give the dried fruit a lighter color. In dipping and drying,\r\nthe fruit, immediately after being cut from the vines, is either\r\ndipped in clear water to first rinse it of particles of dust and other\r\nforeign matter, or it is taken direct to the scalder and immersed in a\r\nboiling alkaline mixture called 'legia' (lye) until the grapes show an\r\nalmost imperceptible cracking of the skin, the operation consuming\r\nperhaps from one-fourth to one-half of a minute. This dipping calls\r\nfor skill on the part of the operator, the duration of the emersion\r\ndepending on the strength and temperature of the mixture and the\r\ncondition of the fruit. Desiccation follows the scalding process,\r\nwhich is accomplished on trays in the sun, the same as undipped\r\nraisins cured entirely by solar heat. On account of the scald they\r\ncure rapidly, and the fruit is also often of lighter color when cured.\r\n\r\n\"The following formula has been used for Sultana and Sultanina grapes\r\nat Fresno:\r\n\r\n    \"Fifteen pounds of 'Greenbank's 98-per cent lye' are boiled in 100\r\n    gallons of water. This mixture is for grapes containing 25 per\r\n    cent of sugar. Should their sugar content be less, enough lye is\r\n    added to remove the bloom and open the pores of the skin of the\r\n    grapes. After dipping, the grapes are spread on trays and\r\n    sulphured for 1 to 1-1/2 hours. Observation will show whether it\r\n    may be necessary to vary this formula a trifle to suit conditions\r\n    of ripeness and influence of temperature. The length of time\r\n    required for dipping is ascertained by experience, and differs\r\n    with the strength of the lye, the heat of the solution, and the\r\n    thickness of the skins of the grapes.\"\r\n\r\n_Packing raisins._\r\n\r\n\"The raisins as received at the packing house are weighed and the\r\nloose raisins and those that are to be shipped as dried grapes are\r\nimmediately run through a stemmer and grader which stems, cleans, and\r\nassorts the raisins into three or four different grades, after which\r\nthey are packed and shipped to various parts of the country, some also\r\nbeing exported. Those producing cluster or layer raisins (if they have\r\nnot already been equalized) are first stored in the equalizing rooms.\r\nIn these rooms the sweat boxes, filled with layers of new raisins, are\r\nstacked and left usually from 10 to 30 days, or long enough for the\r\noverdried berries to absorb moisture from the under-dried ones. This\r\nsweating also properly softens and toughens the stems, which prevents\r\ntheir breaking and enables them to hold the berries better. In\r\nCalifornia, where the climate is so dry, no first class pack could be\r\nmade without thus first equalizing the raisins. After having been\r\nequalized the raisins are taken out, assorted into the different\r\ngrades, and placed in trays holding 5 pounds each. The trays of the\r\nsame grades are then pressed and stacked away in piles ready for\r\npacking.\r\n\r\n\"Pressing the raisins so that they look well and so none are burst\r\nopen is work requiring experience and good judgment. It takes four\r\npressed trays to fill a 20-pound box. The loose raisins that have\r\ndropped from the cluster through handling before they were equalized\r\nare also graded, the largest, of course, making the choicest pack.\"\r\n\r\n_Classes of raisins._\r\n\r\n\"Previous to the consolidated organization of the packers the three\r\nbest grades of raisins on the stems were known as 'Imperial,'\r\n'Dehesia,' and 'Fancy Clusters,' respectively. The California Raisin\r\nGrowers Association established classification and grades similar to\r\nthose of the Spanish raisin packers, on which the French trade names\r\nare also based. The original Spanish, as well as English terms with\r\nwhich they correspond, and the different grades in descending order of\r\nquality are shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n  SPANISH TERMS|FRENCH TERMS   |ENGLISH TERMS         |CALIFORNIA TERMS\r\n  -------------+---------------+----------------------+--------------------\r\n  Imperial     |Imperiaux Extra|Extra Imperial Cluster|Six-Crown Cluster\r\n  Imperial Bajo|Imperiaux      |Imperial Cluster      |Five-Crown Cluster\r\n  Royan Bajo   |Royaux         |Royal Cluster         |Four-Crown Cluster\r\n  Cuarta (4a)  |Surchoix Extra |Choicest              |Three-Crown Cluster\r\n  Quinta (5a)  |Choix Extra    |Choice Cluster        |Two-Crown Cluster\r\n  =========================================================================\r\n\r\n\"The grading is optical, as a result of experience, there being no\r\nlinear or cubic measurement standard. Thus, a nice cluster with all\r\nberries of large size, would be a 'Six-Crown Cluster,' such being the\r\nvery finest raisins on the stem. 'Five-Crown Clusters' were formerly\r\nthe 'Dehesia' cluster, and 'Four-Crown Clusters' were formerly 'Fancy\r\nClusters.' Grades less than 'Four-Crown' on the stems (the\r\n'Three-Crown' and 'Two-Crown') are known as 'Layers,' or 'London\r\nLayers.' These are placed in boxes containing 20 pounds net; in half\r\nboxes of 10 pounds; and quarter boxes of 5 pounds; and in fancy boxes\r\ncontaining 2-1/2 pounds. Loose raisins, or raisins off the stem, are\r\ngraded into Two-Crown, Three-Crown, and Four-Crown raisins by being\r\nrun through screens the meshes of which are thirteen thirty-seconds,\r\nseventeen thirty-seconds, and twenty-two thirty-seconds of an inch in\r\nsize, respectively. The Sultanina (erroneously called Thompson\r\nSeedless), and the Sultana are packed in 12-ounce cartons, 45 to the\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\n_Seeded raisins._\r\n\r\n\"The invention of a raisin-seeding machine by George E. Pettit in the\r\nearly seventies, and its use, has had a wonderful effect on the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\"Seeded raisins were first put on the market by the late Col. William\r\nForsythe, of Fresno, Cal., who at first found it very difficult to\r\ndispose of 20 tons. The output in the last 15 years has increased from\r\n700 tons to 50,000 tons per annum, and their popularity is constantly\r\nincreasing. In 1900 about 14,000 tons were placed on the market, in\r\n1905 about 21,000 tons, in 1910 about 31,000 tons, and in 1913 about\r\n49,000 tons. The seeding machines in present use can turn out 300 tons\r\nper day. Seeded raisins are now the most important branch of the\r\nraisin industry.\r\n\r\n\"A brief outline of how seeded raisins are prepared will prove\r\ninteresting. The raisins are first exposed to a dry temperature of\r\n140° F. for three to five hours, after which they are put through a\r\nchilling process so that the pedicels can be easily removed, and are\r\nthen thoroughly cleansed by being passed through cleaning machines.\r\nThey are then taken by automatic carriers to another room, spread out\r\non trays, and exposed to a moist temperature of 130° F. to bring them\r\nback to their normal condition. The raisins pass to the seeding\r\nmachine, where they are carried between rubber-faced rollers and the\r\nimpaling device of the seeding machine which catches the seeds and\r\nremoves them from the fruits as they are flattened between the\r\nsurfaces of the rollers. The impaled seeds are removed from the roller\r\nby a whisking device in such a way as to be caught in a separate\r\nreceptacle. The seeded raisins pass through chutes to the packing\r\ntables on the floor below.\r\n\r\n\"The seeded or loose raisins are packed in 50-pound boxes; in 1-pound\r\ncartons, 36 to the case; in 12-ounce cartons, 45 to the case; and some\r\nin bulk in 25-pound boxes.\r\n\r\n\"Information has recently been sent out to the effect that the\r\nCalifornia Associated Raisin Co. is arranging to do away with the\r\ngrades in seeded raisins, so there will only be one grade. This\r\ncontemplates using all of the Three-Crown, the smallest of the\r\nFour-Crown, and the best of the Two-Crown in one blended grade.\r\n\r\n\"From the seeds, formerly used as a fuel, a number of by-products are\r\nnow made.\r\n\r\n\"The seeds and pedicels removed from the raisins in seeding vary from\r\n10 to 12 per cent of the original weight of the raisins according to\r\ntheir conditions and quality.\r\n\r\n\"The grading, seeding, facing, and packing have become separate\r\nbranches of the industry, and the work is nearly all done by\r\nespecially trained women, who have become experts at it. The\r\nestablishments in which this work is done furnish employment for over\r\n5000 persons. The aggregate pay roll each month during the season is\r\nbetween $200,000 and $350,000.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPE-VINEGAR\r\n\r\nA very good vinegar can be made from grapes, although as yet this\r\noutlet for over-production is not largely utilized in America. Grapes\r\nwhich are unsuitable for raisins, dessert, wine-making or grape-juice\r\ncan be used for vinegar-making. Under the most favorable conditions,\r\ngrape-vinegar cannot compete in cheapness with vinegar made from\r\nnumerous other products and must, therefore, always sell at a high\r\nprice. Indeed, it is doubtful whether a high-grade grape-vinegar can\r\nbe manufactured at a less price than good wine. The production of\r\ngrape-vinegar requires as much care, but possibly not as much expert\r\nknowledge, as the making of wine. Unlike the latter, however, the\r\nvinegar can be produced on a small scale for domestic purposes by any\r\none possessing a knowledge of wine-making or vinegar-making.\r\n\r\nGrape-vinegar may be manufactured from either white or red grapes,\r\nalthough that from white grapes is generally preferred. It may be made\r\neither directly from grapes or from wine, the acetifying process being\r\nthe same for both. There are, therefore, two distinct stages in the\r\nmanufacture of this product. First, there must be alcoholic\r\nfermentation by which the sugar in the grape is changed into alcohol\r\nwith the escape of carbonic acid gas. Second, acetic fermentation must\r\nfollow the alcoholic fermentation by which the alcohol is changed into\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY-PRODUCTS OF GRAPE INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\nThere are several valuable by-products in the wine-making and\r\ngrape-juice industries, and even raisin-making yields a by-product in\r\nthe seeds taken from the raisins. The utilization of these wastes has\r\nbeen rendered profitable in Europe, and there is no reason why\r\nby-products should not yield considerable profit in America, as a few\r\nalready do. Good authorities state that if all the wastes of the\r\ngrape crop could be utilized the value of the crop would be increased\r\nover 10 per cent.\r\n\r\n_Pomace._\r\n\r\nThe pomace or marc, the residue left after grape pressing, is the most\r\nvaluable of the by-products of the wine and grape-juice manufacturers.\r\nIf the pomace is permitted to ferment, and afterwards is distilled, a\r\nproduct called pomace-brandy is made. Unscrupulous wine-makers often\r\nadd water and sugar to pomace, after which it is refermented and the\r\nresulting product is sold as wine. Notwithstanding the fact that the\r\nword \"wine\" as applied to this product is a misnomer, the total amount\r\nof such wine made and consumed in America is large. Piquette is\r\nanother product in which the pomace is put into fermenting vats,\r\nsprinkled with water and the liquid after a time is drawn off,\r\ncarrying with it the wine contained in the pomace. This liquid is\r\nre-used in other pomace, until it is high enough in alcoholic\r\nstrength, when it is distilled into \"piquette\" or \"wash.\"\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the pomace from stemmed grapes is said to make a sheep and\r\ncattle food of more or less value when salted slightly and stored in\r\nsilos. The pomace is also oftentimes used as a manure, for which it\r\nhas considerable to recommend it, being rich in potash and nitrogen.\r\nAcetic acid is made from pomace by drying it in vapor-tight rooms,\r\nduring which process 50 to 60 per cent of the weight of the pomace\r\nbecomes vapor, and this, condensed, yields considerable quantities of\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\n_Cream-of-tartar._\r\n\r\nThe lees of wine, the sediment which settles in the casks in which new\r\nwine or grape-juice is stored, form a grayish or reddish crust on the\r\ninside of the receptacle. This is the argol or wine-stone of the\r\nwine-maker, and from it is made cream-of-tartar, an article\r\nconsiderably used in medicine, the arts and for culinary purposes.\r\nFrom 20 to 70 per cent of the lees consist of either cream-of-tartar,\r\nor of calcium tartrate, the latter also having commercial value. Red\r\nwines are much richer in argol than white wines. A ton of grapes\r\nyields from one to two pounds of argol. This product becomes a source\r\nof considerable profit in large wineries and in grape-juice\r\nmanufacturing plants.\r\n\r\n_Seeds._\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the seeds are separated from the pomace and used in various\r\nways. They are also utilized to a smaller extent in America,\r\nespecially when separated from raisins. The seeds are used as food for\r\nhorses, cattle and poultry, for which they are said to have\r\nconsiderable value. If crushed and ground, the seeds yield a clear\r\nyellow oil which burns without smoke or smell and which may also be\r\nemployed as a substitute for olive oil. A ton of grapes yields from\r\nforty to one hundred pounds of seeds from which may be made from three\r\nto sixteen pounds of oil. This oil is also used as a substitute for\r\nlinseed oil and in soap-making. Besides oil, the seeds yield tannin.\r\nAfter the oil and tannin have been taken from the seeds, there remains\r\na meal which may still be utilized as a stock food or as a fertilizer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTIC USES FOR GRAPES\r\n\r\nAt present, when food conservation is being emphasized everywhere,\r\nmention of the domestic use for grapes is particularly appropriate.\r\nThe country over, no fruit is more generally grown than the grape; yet\r\ngrape products are not as common for home use as those of several\r\nother fruits, although many attractive and appetizing preserves can be\r\nmade from grapes without the use of large quantities of sugar, spices\r\nor other ingredients. Few housekeepers realize the high quality and\r\nthe cheapness of the products that can be made from the grape. Thus,\r\ngrape-juice, jelly, jam, marmalade, grape-butter, catsup, spiced\r\ngrapes, canned grapes, conserves in which grapes are used, preserves\r\nand mince-meat are among the desirable culinary products easily and\r\ncheaply prepared from home-grown grapes or those bought in the market.\r\nOnly simple domestic utensils are needed in the preparation of any of\r\nthese products.\r\n\r\nGrape-sirup is less easily produced, yet can be made in any home\r\nwithout the addition of sugar. It is not only a good table sirup, but\r\nis a most useful sugar substitute for the preparation of other\r\nculinary products. The Muscadine grapes in the South, to be purchased\r\nby almost every householder in southeastern United States, in\r\nparticular, are useful for these domestic products. Recipes for all of\r\nthese products can be found in cook books, and one or two bulletins\r\nand circulars from the United States Department of Agriculture give\r\nrecipes for preparing grapes for domestic purposes. Farmers' Bulletin\r\n859 entitled _Home Uses for Muscadine Grapes_ is a particularly\r\nvaluable publication on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that several large manufacturers of\r\ngrape-juice are putting on the market grape jams, jellies and\r\nmarmalades. It would seem that these delicious and wholesome products\r\nwould find a ready sale in the markets of the country, and that their\r\nmanufacture would prove profitable to the maker and to the\r\ngrape-grower. The greater the use of grapes for their products, the\r\nbetter the grower can breast the blows of unfavorable markets and\r\nover-production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XX.--Isabella (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nGRAPE-BREEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nChance, pure and simple, has been the greatest factor in the\r\nproduction of varieties of American grapes. From the millions of wild\r\nplants, an occasional grape of pre-eminent merit has caught the eye of\r\nthe cultivator and has been brought into the vineyard to be the\r\nprogenitor of a new variety. Or in the vineyards, more often in\r\nnear-by waste lands, from the prodigious number of seedlings that\r\nspring up, pure or cross-bred, a plant of merit becomes the foundation\r\nof a new variety. An interesting fact in the domestication of the four\r\nchief species of American grapes is that none came under cultivation\r\nuntil forms of them, striking in value, had been found. Catawba,\r\nrepresenting the Labrusca grapes; the Scuppernong, the Rotundifolias;\r\nNorton, from _Vitis æstivalis_; Delaware and Herbemont from the\r\nBourquiniana grapes; and Clinton from _Vitis vulpina_, are, after a\r\ncentury, scarcely excelled, although in each species there are now\r\nmany new varieties.\r\n\r\nThat our best grapes have come from chance is not because of a lack of\r\nhuman effort to produce superior varieties. Of all fruits, the grape\r\nhas received most attention in America from the generation of\r\nplant-breeders just passing. Grape-breeders have produced 2000 or more\r\nvarieties, a medley of the heterogeneous characters of a dozen\r\nspecies. That so many of this vast number are worthless is due more to\r\na lack of knowledge of plant-breeding than to a lack of effort, for\r\nthe order and system in plant-breeding that now prevail, disclosed by\r\nrecent brilliant discoveries, were unknown to grape-breeders of the\r\nlast century.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAPE HYBRIDS\r\n\r\nAs early as 1822, Nuttall, a noted botanist, then at Harvard,\r\nrecommended \"hybrids betwixt the European vine and those of the United\r\nStates which would better answer the variable climates of North\r\nAmerica.\" In 1830, William Robert Prince, Fig. 48, fourth proprietor\r\nof the then famous Linnean Botanic Nursery at Flushing, Long Island,\r\ngrew 10,000 seedling grapes \"from admixture under every variety of\r\ncircumstance.\" This was probably the first attempt on a large scale to\r\nimprove the native grapes by hybridizing, although little seems to\r\nhave come of it. Later, a Dr. Valk, also of Flushing, grew hybrids\r\nfrom which he obtained Ada, the first named hybrid, the introduction\r\nof which started hybridizers to work in all parts of the country where\r\ngrapes were grown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48. William Robert Prince.]\r\n\r\nSoon after Valk's hybrid was sent out, E. S. Rogers, Fig. 49, Salem,\r\nMassachusetts, and J. H. Ricketts, Newburgh, New York, began to give\r\nviticulturists hybrids of the European Vinifera and the American\r\nspecies which were so promising that enthusiasm and speculation in\r\ngrape-growing ran riot. Never before nor since has grape-growing\r\nreceived the attention in America as given during the introduction of\r\nRogers' hybrids. It was the expectation of all that we were to grow in\r\nAmerica, in these hybrids, grapes but little inferior, if at all, to\r\nthose of Europe.\r\n\r\nA statement of the difference between European and American grapes\r\nshows why American viticulturists have been so eager to grow either\r\npure-breds from the foreign grape or hybrids with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49. E. S. Rogers.]\r\n\r\nEuropean grapes have a higher sugar-and-solid content than the\r\nAmerican species; they, therefore, make better wines and keep much\r\nlonger after harvesting and can be made into raisins. Also, they have\r\na greater variety of flavors, which are more delicate, yet richer,\r\nwith a pleasanter aroma, seldom so acid, and are always lacking the\r\ndisagreeable, rancid odor and taste, the \"foxiness,\" of many American\r\nvarieties. There is, however, an unpleasant astringency in some of the\r\nforeign grapes, and many varieties are without character of flavor.\r\nAmerican table-grapes, on the other hand, are more refreshing, the\r\nunfermented juice makes a pleasanter drink, and lacking sweetness and\r\nrichness, they do not cloy the appetite so quickly. The bunches and\r\nberries of the European grapes are larger, more attractive and are\r\nborne in greater quantities. The pulp, seeds and skins are somewhat\r\nobjectionable in all of the native species and scarcely so at all in\r\nthe Old World sorts. The berries of the native grapes shell from the\r\nstem so quickly that the bunches do not ship well. The vines of the\r\nOld World grapes are more compact in habit and require less pruning\r\nand training than do those of the native grapes; and, as a species,\r\nprobably through long cultivation, they are adapted to more kinds of\r\nsoil, to greater differences in environment and are more easily\r\npropagated than the American species.\r\n\r\nBecause of these points of superiority in the Old World grape, since\r\nValk, Allen and Rogers showed the way, American grape-breeders have\r\nsought to unite by hybridization the good characters of the Old World\r\ngrape with those of the American. Nearly half of the 2000 grapes\r\ncultivated in eastern America have more or less European blood in\r\nthem. Yet, despite the efforts of the breeders, few of these hybrids\r\nhave commercial value. Whether because they are naturally better\r\nfixed, or long cultivation has more firmly established them, the vine\r\ncharacters of _Vitis vinifera_ more often appear in varieties arising\r\nas primary hybrids between that and the native species, and the\r\nweaknesses of the foreign grape, which prevent their cultivation in\r\nAmerica, crop out. Hybrids in which the vinifera blood is more\r\nattenuated, as secondary or tertiary crosses, give better results.\r\n\r\nSeveral secondary hybrids now rank among the best of the cultivated\r\ngrapes. Examples are Brighton and Diamond. The first is a cross\r\nbetween Diana-Hamburg, a hybrid of a Vinifera and a Labrusca, crossed\r\nin its turn with Concord, a Labrusca; the second is a cross between\r\nIona, also a hybrid between a Vinifera and a Labrusca, crossed with\r\nConcord. Both were grown from seed planted by Jacob Moore, Brighton,\r\nNew York, in 1870. Brighton was the first secondary hybrid to attract\r\nthe attention of grape-breeders, and its advent marked an important\r\nstep in breeding grapes.\r\n\r\nThe signal success achieved by hybridizers of the European grape with\r\nnative species quickly led to similar amalgamations among American\r\nspecies. Jacob Rommel, of Morrison, Missouri, beginning work about\r\n1860, hybridized Labrusca and Vulpina grapes so successfully that a\r\ndozen or more of his varieties are still cultivated. All are\r\ncharacterized by great vigor and productiveness; and, although they\r\nlack the qualities which make good table-grapes, they are among the\r\nbest for wine-making. Rommel has had many followers in hybridizing\r\nnative species, chief of whom was the late T. V. Munson, Fig. 50,\r\nDenison, Texas, who literally made every combination of grapes\r\npossible, grew thousands of seedlings and produced many valuable\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50. T. V. Munson.]\r\n\r\n_Improvement by selection._\r\n\r\nSelection, continued through successive generations, so important in\r\nthe improvement of field and garden plants, has played but small part\r\nin the domestication of the grape. The period between planting and\r\nfruiting is so long that progress would be slow indeed were this\r\nmethod relied on. Moreover, selection, as a method in breeding, is\r\npossible only when plants are bred pure, and it is the experience of\r\ngrape-breeders that in pure breeding this fruit loses in vigor and\r\nproductiveness and that the variations are exceedingly slight and\r\nunstable. Many pure-bred grapes have been raised on the grounds of the\r\nNew York Agricultural Experiment Station under the eyes of the writer,\r\nof which very few have surpassed the parent or have shown promise for\r\nthe practice of selection.\r\n\r\n_New varieties from sports._\r\n\r\nBud-sports or mutations now and then arise in grapes. But not more\r\nthan two or three of the 2000 varieties now under cultivation are\r\nsuspected of having arisen in this way. It is true that mutations\r\nseem to occur rather often in grapes, but they are easily confused\r\nwith variations due to environment and are usually too vague to lay\r\nhands on. Until the causes of these mutations are known and until they\r\ncan be produced and controlled, but little can be hoped for in the\r\namelioration of grapes through mutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBRIDIZING THE GRAPE\r\n\r\nHybridization has been the chief means of improving the grape. At\r\npresent, from what is being accomplished by many workers, it looks as\r\nif it will long continue to be the best means of improving this fruit.\r\nSince the grape-grower must depend on new varieties for progress, as\r\nold varieties cannot be changed, it should be the ambition of growers\r\nto produce varieties better than those we now have. Many amateur and\r\nprofessional grape-growers in the past have found breeding grapes a\r\npleasing and profitable hobby, so that much knowledge has accumulated\r\nin regard to manipulating the plants in hybridization, and the results\r\nthat follow in the offspring of hybridization.\r\n\r\n_How to hybridize._\r\n\r\nIt is assumed that the reader is familiar with the botany of flowers\r\nand the essential principles in crossing plants. If he is not, he must\r\ncarefully study the structure of flowers, especially those of the\r\ngrape, so as to be able to distinguish the different organs and to\r\ndiscover when the pollen and stigma are ready for the work of\r\npollination. He should, also, read any one of several current books on\r\nplant-breeding.\r\n\r\nThe first task in crossing grapes is to remove the anthers before the\r\nflower opens, a process known as emasculation. This is necessary to\r\nprevent self-pollination. This first operation having been performed,\r\nthe cluster of grape-flowers must be tied securely in a bag to protect\r\nit from foreign pollen which otherwise would surely be carried to the\r\nstigma by insects. As soon as the stigma is ready to receive the\r\npollen, the bag is removed and pollen from the male parent is applied,\r\nafter which the bag is again put on the flower to remain until the\r\ngrapes are well set. By examining the stigmas in the flowers of\r\nuncovered grapes, the operator can tell approximately whether the\r\ncovered stigma is ready to receive pollen. The time required after\r\ncovering depends, of course, on the age of the bud when emasculation\r\ntakes place. It is, by the way, best to delay emasculation until just\r\nbefore the flowers open, but one must be certain that the anthers have\r\nnot discharged their pollen before the flower has been emasculated.\r\n\r\nEmasculation is a simple operation. The essential organs of the\r\ngrape-flower are covered by a small cap; this in some grapes must be\r\nremoved before the anthers can be reached. In many native grapes,\r\nhowever, the cap and the anthers may be removed at one stroke by the\r\noperator. The best tool for this is a small pair of forceps. Each of\r\nthe blades of the forceps in working with native grapes should have a\r\nsharp cutting surface, but with Vinifera sorts, where the cap must be\r\nremoved before the anthers can be reached, forcep blades with a flat\r\nsurface are best. There is, of course, some danger when the buds are\r\nwell developed that the pollen may be squeezed out and so reach the\r\nstigma or adhere to the instrument and thus contaminate future\r\ncrosses. The first danger must be avoided carefully by the skill of\r\nthe operator, while the second is easily overcome by sterilizing the\r\nforceps in alcohol. An effort should be made to fertilize as many of\r\nthe flowers in the cluster as possible, but success is not always\r\ncertain; when there is doubt, the uncertain flower should be removed\r\nfrom the cluster.\r\n\r\nThe flower from which the pollen is to be taken must be protected from\r\nwind and insects; otherwise pollen from another flower may be left on\r\nit. Protection should be given by tying the flowers in a bag while\r\nstill in bud. There are various ways of obtaining pollen from ripe\r\nanthers and applying it to the stigma of the flowers to be crossed.\r\nThe simplest is to crush the anthers, thus squeezing out the pollen,\r\nafter which, with a brush, scalpel or other instrument, it may be\r\nplaced upon the stigma. A brush is very wasteful of pollen and often\r\nbecomes a source of contamination to future crosses, so that the\r\nscalpel is the better implement of the two. When pollen is plentiful,\r\nas will usually be the case when a man is working with vines in his\r\nown vineyard, by far the best method is to take the cluster from the\r\nmale vine and apply the pollen directly to the stigma of the flower to\r\nbe crossed, thereby making certain of fresh pollen and an abundance of\r\nit. The stigma, if pollen suffice, should be covered with pollen.\r\n\r\nGrape pollen does not keep well and an effort should be made to have\r\nit as fresh as possible. The work of pollination is best performed in\r\nbright, sunny weather when the pollen is very dry. As may be seen from\r\nthe foregoing statements, tools and methods are of less importance\r\nthan care in doing the work. The only tool absolutely necessary is a\r\npair of forceps, although a hand-lens is often helpful. Bags for\r\ncovering the flowers should be just large enough and no larger. A bag\r\nto cover the pollen-producing flower may well be an ordinary manilla\r\nbag sufficiently large to amply cover the flower-cluster. It is\r\nhelpful, however, to have a light transparent oiled bag through which\r\none can see the condition of the anthers. It is desirable that the bag\r\nfor the female flower be permitted to remain until the fruits ripen as\r\na protection against birds and fungi. It must, therefore, be of larger\r\nsize. While the bags are still flat, a hole is made near the opening\r\nthrough which a string is passed which can be tied when the upper end\r\nof the bag is squeezed about the cluster.\r\n\r\n_Choosing the parents._\r\n\r\nVery much depends on the immediate parentage in hybridizing grapes.\r\nSome varieties when crossed produce much higher averages of worthy\r\noffspring than others. There is so much difference in varieties in\r\nthis respect that to discover parents so endowed should be the first\r\ntask of the grape-breeder. Fortunately, considerable work has been\r\ndone by several experiment stations in breeding grapes, and their\r\naccumulated knowledge, together with that from such workers as Rogers,\r\nRicketts, Campbell and Munson, furnishes beginners with good starting\r\npoints. There is no way possible of discovering what the best\r\nprogenitors are except by records of performance. Very often varieties\r\nof high cultural value are worthless in breeding because their\r\ncharacters seem not to be transmitted to their progeny and, to the\r\ncontrary, a good-for-nothing variety in the vineyard is often valuable\r\nin breeding.\r\n\r\nFrom present knowledge it does not appear that new characters are\r\nintroduced in plants by hybridizing. A new variety originating from\r\nhybridization is but a recombination of the characters of the parents;\r\nthe combination is new but the characters are not. Thus, one parent of\r\na hybridized grape may contribute color, size, flavor and practically\r\nall the characters of the fruit, while the other parent may contribute\r\nvigor, hardiness, resistance to disease and the characters of the\r\nvine. Or these and other characters in the make-up of a new grape may\r\nbe intermingled in any mathematical way possible. The grape-breeder\r\nmust make certain that one or the other of the parents possesses the\r\nparticular characters he desires in his new grape.\r\n\r\nIt is now known that the characters of the grape, in common with those\r\nof other plants, are inherited in accordance with certain laws\r\ndiscovered by Mendel. The early workers in grape-breeding did not know\r\nof these laws and could not take aim in the work they were doing.\r\nConsequently, hybridization was a maze in which these breeders often\r\nlost themselves. Mendel's discoveries, however, assure a regularity of\r\naverages and give a definiteness and constancy of action which enable\r\nthe grape-breeder to attain with fair certainty what he wants if he\r\nkeeps patiently at his task. The grape-breeder should inform himself\r\nas to what Mendel's laws are, and on the work that has been done on\r\nthe inheritance of characters of the grape. A technical bulletin\r\npublished by the State Experiment Station at Geneva, New York, and\r\nanother from the North Carolina Station at Raleigh give much\r\ninformation on the inheritance of characters in certain grapes, and\r\nfurther information can be secured by applying to the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture at Washington for literature on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe grape-breeder can hope to progress only by making many\r\ncombinations between different varieties and growing large numbers of\r\nseedlings. He should extend his work to all varieties which show\r\npromise in the breeding of grapes for the particular purpose he has in\r\nmind. The seed may be saved and planted as directed in the chapter on\r\npropagation. Unless he desires to make scientific interpretations of\r\nhis results, weak seedlings should be discarded the first year, and a\r\nsecond discard may be made before the young plants go in the vineyard.\r\nThe breeder will soon discover that he can tell fairly well from the\r\ncharacter of the seedlings whether they are of sufficient promise to\r\nkeep. Thus, if the number of leaves is small or if the leaves\r\nthemselves are small, the vine is of doubtful value; if the internodes\r\nare exceedingly long, the prospect is poor; slenderness of cane, if\r\naccentuated, does not promise well; on the other hand, great stoutness\r\nand very short internodes are not desirable indications. Through these\r\nand other signs, the breeder will come quickly to know which vines\r\nshould eventually go to the vineyard.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF GRAPE-BREEDING\r\n\r\nThere are now 2000 or more varieties of grapes of American origin, all\r\nproduced within approximately a century. It is doubtful whether any\r\nother cultivated plant at any time in the history of the world has\r\nattained such importance in so short a time from the wild state as\r\nAmerican grapes. It would seem that almost every possible combination\r\nbetween species worth considering has been made. Through\r\nhybridization, species and varieties have become so mixed that the\r\ngrape-breeder cannot now work intelligently with these gross forms and\r\nmust work with characters rather than with species and varieties which\r\nare but combinations of characters. Great progress, it is true, has\r\nbeen made in the past in breeding grapes in America, but the work has\r\nbeen wholly empirical and extremely wasteful. Many varieties have been\r\ncalled, but few have been chosen. With the new knowledge of breeding\r\nand with the experience of past workers, progress should be made with\r\ngreater certainty. From what has been done and from work now under\r\nway, it is not too much to say that we shall soon be growing grapes\r\neverywhere in America, and kinds so diverse that they will meet not\r\nonly all purposes to which grapes are now put, but also the demand for\r\nbetter grapes made by more critical consumers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXI.--Jefferson (×3/5).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMISCELLANIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere yet remain several phases of grape-culture essential to success,\r\nnone of which quite deserves a chapter and none of which properly\r\nfalls into any of the foregoing chapters. The subjects are not closely\r\nrelated, are by no means of equal importance, yet all are too\r\nimportant to be relegated to the limbo of an appendix and are,\r\ntherefore, thrown into a chapter of miscellanies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSS-POLLINATION\r\n\r\nThe blooming of the vine had little significance to the grape-grower,\r\nthe blooming period being so late that grapes are seldom caught by\r\nfrost, until the discovery was made that many varieties of grapes are\r\nunable to fertilize themselves, and that failure of crops of these\r\nvarieties was often due to the self-sterility of the variety. Until\r\nthis discovery, the uncertainty attending the setting of the grape in\r\nthese varieties was one of the discouragements of grape-growing.\r\nFollowing investigations of the self-sterility of the tree-fruits, an\r\ninvestigation of the grape showed that the vines of this fruit are\r\noften self-sterile. This knowledge has in some degree modified the\r\nplanting of all home collections and has more or less affected the\r\nplantings of commercial sorts.\r\n\r\nVarieties of American grapes show most remarkable differences in the\r\ndegree of self-fertility. Many sorts fruit perfectly without\r\ncross-pollination. Others set no fruit whatsoever if cross-pollination\r\nis not provided for. Most varieties, however, are found in groups\r\nbetween the two extremes, neither self-fertile nor self-sterile.\r\nFigure 51 shows staminate and perfect clusters on one vine. Some\r\nvarieties show no variation in the degree of self-sterility or\r\nself-fertility; others behave differently in regard to these\r\ncharacters under different environment. Now and then the widest\r\nvariations are to be found in a variety in respect to self-fertility.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. Staminate and perfect clusters on one vine;\r\n_right_, staminate; _left_, perfect.]\r\n\r\nFollowing the lead of Beach at the New York Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation, several workers have made careful studies of the\r\nself-fertility of the grape, and now the cultivated varieties of\r\nnative grapes are divided into four groups in accordance with the\r\ndegree of self-fertility. Class I includes self-fertile varieties\r\nhaving perfect or nearly perfect clusters; Class II includes\r\nself-fertile varieties having clusters loose but marketable; Class III\r\nincludes varieties which are so imperfectly self-fertile that the\r\nclusters are generally too loose to be marketable; Class IV includes\r\nself-sterile varieties. The following is a list of commonly cultivated\r\ngrapes classified according to the divisions just given:\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF GRAPES ACCORDING TO SELF-FERTILITY\r\n\r\nCLASS I.

Self-sterile. No fruit develops on covered clusters.\r\n\r\n    America\r\n    Aminia\r\n    Barry\r\n    Black Eagle\r\n    Clevener\r\n    Creveling\r\n    Eldorado\r\n    Faith (?)\r\n    Gaertner\r\n    Grein Golden\r\n    Hercules\r\n    Jewel\r\n    Massasoit\r\n    Maxatawney (?)\r\n    Merrimac\r\n    Montefiore\r\n    Requa\r\n    Salem\r\n    Wyoming\r\n\r\nIn the main, the cause of infertility, as with other fruits, is the\r\nimpotency of pollen on the pistils of the same variety. There are a\r\nfew cases in which pollen does not seem to be formed abundantly, but\r\nthese are very few. There are a few cases, also, in which the pistil\r\ndoes not become receptive until after the pollen has lost its\r\nvitality; these, however, are very few. In a greater number of cases\r\nthe pollen is found defective. However, dismissing all of these as the\r\nexception, the rule is that self-sterility is due, as has been said,\r\nto the lack of affinity between pollen and pistils produced on the\r\nvines of some varieties.\r\n\r\nNature is helpful to the grape-grower in giving a guide to\r\nself-fertility. The length of stamens is a fairly safe indication of\r\nself-fertility. All grapes which are self-fertile bear flowers with\r\nlong stamens, although the latter are not a sure sign of\r\nself-fertility, as a few varieties with long stamens are self-sterile.\r\nOn the other hand, short or recurved stamens are always associated\r\nwith complete or nearly complete self-sterility.\r\n\r\nThe remedy for self-sterility is inter-planting. Only the varieties\r\nnamed in Classes I and II in the foregoing classification should be\r\nplanted alone. The sorts named in Classes III and IV must be planted\r\nnear other sorts which bloom at the same time in order that their\r\nflowers may be cross-pollinated.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the grape-grower must have some knowledge of the\r\nrelative time that grapes bloom, if he is to plant intelligently to\r\nsecure cross-pollination. The following table, taken from Bulletin 407\r\nof the New York Agricultural Experiment Station, shows the blooming\r\ntime of grapes at that Station. Variations due to location and season\r\nmust be expected, but within the bounds of the regions in which these\r\ngrapes are grown variations will be slight. When this table is used\r\nfor other regions than New York, it must be borne in mind that the\r\nfarther south, the longer the blooming season; the farther north, the\r\nshorter the season.\r\n\r\n_Blooming dates of grapes._\r\n\r\nFrom three years' records, the average length of blooming season for\r\ngrapes was twenty days, nineteen days in 1912 and 1914 and twenty-two\r\ndays in 1913. The first date in the average year of 1912 was June 14,\r\nwhile for 1914, it was June 7:\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.--SHOWING BLOOMING TIME OF GRAPES\r\n\r\n

objects may be attained by ringing: unproductive plants may be\r\nbrought into bearing by ringing; the size of the fruits may be\r\nincreased and thereby the plants be made more productive; and the\r\nmaturity of the fruit may be hastened. In European countries, ringing\r\nhas long been practiced with all tree-fruits and the grape, but in\r\nAmerica the operation is recommended only for the apple and the grape\r\nand with neither fruit is ringing widely practiced. Experiments\r\ncarried on at the New York Agricultural Experiment Station by Paddock,\r\nas reported in Bulletin 151 from this Station, show that ringing may\r\nwell be practiced by grape-growers under some conditions. Since\r\nPaddock's experiments, and possibly to some extent before, the grape\r\nhas been ringed to produce exhibition fruits or a fancy product for\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nRinging consists in taking from the vine a layer of bark around the\r\nvine through the cortex and bast of the plant. The width of the wound\r\nvaries from that of a simple cut made with a knife to a band of bark\r\nan inch in diameter. The operation is performed during that period of\r\ngrowth in which the bark peels most readily from the vine, the period\r\nof greatest cambial activity. The term \"ringing\" is preferred to\r\n\"girdling,\" a word sometimes used, since the latter properly\r\ndesignates a wound which extends into and usually kills the plant.\r\n\r\nThe theory of ringing is simple. Unassimilated sap passes from the\r\nroots of the plant to the leaves through the outer layer of the woody\r\ncylinder. In the leaves this raw material is acted on by various\r\nagents, after which it is distributed to the several organs of the\r\nplant through vessels in the inner bark. When plants are ringed, the\r\nupward flow of sap is continued as before the operation, but the newly\r\nmade food compounds cannot pass beyond the injury, and therefore the\r\ntop of the plant is supplied with an extra amount of food at the\r\nexpense of the parts below the ring. The extra food produces the\r\nresults noted.\r\n\r\nIt turns out in practice that ringing is usually harmful to the plant,\r\nas one might expect from so unnatural an operation. Injury to the\r\nplant arises from the fact that parts of the vine are starved at the\r\nexpense of other parts; and because, when the bark is removed, the\r\nouter layers of the woody cylinder dry out very quickly and thus check\r\nto some extent the upward flow of sap through evaporation from the\r\nexposed wood. Thus, not infrequently, the plant's vitality is\r\nseriously drained. Nevertheless, vineyards may be found in which\r\nringing has been extensively practiced many seasons in succession and\r\nwhich continue to yield profitable crops, the growers having learned\r\nto perform the work of ringing so as to injure the vines but little.\r\n\r\nRinging without harm to the plant depends much on the way in which the\r\nvines have been pruned. For instance, if the vines are pruned to the\r\ntwo-arm Kniffin method, the ringing of bark should be done from both\r\narms just beyond the fifth bud. Thus, the ten buds left on the vine\r\nproduce enough leaf surface to supply the food necessary to keep the\r\nvine in vigorous condition. When the four-arm Kniffin method is used,\r\nthe two top arms only are ringed, and even so three or four buds must\r\nbe left on each for renewals. Whatever the method of training, it will\r\nbe seen from these examples that some unringed wood must be left to\r\nthe vine with which to supply leafy shoots to support the vine. Some\r\ngrowers ring their vines only every other year, thus giving them an\r\nopportunity to recover from whatever loss of vigor they may have\r\nsustained in the season of ringing.\r\n\r\nSeveral other considerations are important in ringing: First, the\r\nvines must not be permitted to carry too large a crop. Again, the\r\namount of fruit on the ringed portion of the vine must depend on the\r\namount of leaf surface not only of the plant but of the ringed arms,\r\neach ringed arm acting somewhat independently so far as its crop is\r\nconcerned. If too many clusters are left on the ringed arms, it always\r\nfollows that the fruit is inferior and often worthless. Lastly, all\r\nfruit between the rings and the trunk must be removed, for it does not\r\nmature properly and so adds only to the drain on the plant's vitality.\r\n\r\nAs to the results, it is certain from the experiments that have been\r\nconducted and from the experience of grape-growers, that the maturity\r\nof the fruit is hastened, and berries and bunches are larger when the\r\nringing has been done intelligently. Many growers hold that fruit\r\nproduced on ringed vines is never quite up to the mark in quality and\r\nin firmness of fruit. There seems to be a difference in opinion about\r\nthis falling off in quality, however, although unquestionably, choice\r\nsorts, as Delaware, Iona and Dutchess, suffer more or less in quality.\r\nIt is commonly agreed, also, that varieties, the fruits of which crack\r\nbadly, as the Worden, suffer more from cracking on ringed than on\r\nunringed vines.\r\n\r\nExperiment and experience prove that the best results of ringing are\r\nobtained if the work is done when the grapes are about one-third\r\ngrown. Of course the exact time depends on the season and on the\r\nvariety. The operation is variously performed and is easily done with\r\na sharp knife, but when large vineyards are to be ringed the grower\r\nought to provide himself with some simple tool. Paddock, in the\r\nbulletin previously mentioned, pictures two of these tools and these\r\nare reproduced in Fig. 52.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52. Tools used in ringing grape-vines are shown in\r\n1 and 2; while 3 and 4 show ringed vines at the beginning and the\r\nclose of the season.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it must be said that it is doubtful whether the gains\r\nattained by ringing offset the losses. The practice is chiefly of\r\nvalue only when exhibition clusters of grapes are wanted or when it is\r\nnecessary to hasten the maturity of the crop. Always, however, the\r\nwork must be performed with intelligence and judgment or the losses\r\nwill offset the gains.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAGGING GRAPES\r\n\r\nIn some localities bagging is considered an essential to profitable\r\ngrape-growing. The bags serve to protect the grapes against birds. In\r\nsome grape regions vineyards suffer more from the depredations of\r\nrobins and other birds than from all other troubles. Grapes bearing\r\nsmall berries and having tender pulp and those which shell most\r\nreadily from the stem suffer most. Of standard sorts, Delaware is\r\nprobably more enticing to robins than any other variety. There is only\r\none way of preventing damage to grapes from birds and that is by\r\nbagging the clusters.\r\n\r\nBagging is also an effective means of protecting the grape from\r\nseveral fungi and insects. In home plantations or small commercial\r\nvineyards, bagging the bunches often eliminates the necessity of\r\nspraying for fungi and for most of the insects that trouble the grape.\r\nBecause of the warmth afforded by the bags, bagged grapes ripen a\r\nlittle earlier and are of somewhat higher quality than those not\r\nbagged. Grapes bagged are protected from early frost, thus prolonging\r\nthe season. Grapes that have been protected from the elements during\r\nthe summer are more attractive than those exposed to the weather,\r\nsince the fruits are free from weather marks and present a fresh,\r\nbright appearance, which puts them in a grade above unbagged grapes.\r\nBagging often enables the grower to sell his crop as a fancy product.\r\n\r\nGrapes are bagged as soon as the fruits are well set, the sooner the\r\nbetter if protection against fungi is one of the purposes. Under no\r\ncircumstances, however, should the clusters be bagged while in\r\nblossom. A patent bag made for the purpose may be purchased or,\r\nserving equally well, the common one and one-half and two-pound manila\r\nbags used by grocers prove satisfactory. One of the patent bags which\r\nis known as the Ideal Clasp Bag has a metal clasp attached to the top\r\nfor securing the bag in place over the cluster. In using the grocer's\r\nbag, before it is put in place the corners of both the top and bottom\r\nare cut off by placing several bags on a firm level surface and using\r\na broad-shaped chisel. Cutting off the corners of the top enables the\r\noperator to close the bag neatly over the cluster, while cutting off\r\nthe corners of the bottom furnishes a means of escape for any water\r\nthat gets in the bag. In putting the bag in place, the top is pinned\r\nabove the lateral from which the bunch hangs, and must not be fastened\r\nabout the small stem of the cluster, as the wind blowing the bag\r\nalmost invariably breaks the cluster from the vine. The largest pins\r\nto be purchased in dry-goods stores are used in pinning the bags. The\r\nbags remain until the grapes are picked. Wet weather does not injure\r\nbags and seemingly they grow stronger with exposure to sun and wind.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the bags and the work of putting them on is no small item.\r\nTo secure the best results, the work must be done at the period\r\nbetween the dropping of the blossoms and the formation of the seeds,\r\nwhen the grapes are about the size of a small pea. This is a busy time\r\nfor the grape-grower, which adds to the cost. When the work is\r\nconducted on a large scale, the cost is about two dollars a thousand\r\nbags, this figure covering both the cost of bags and labor. Women do\r\nthe work more expeditiously than men and soon become very skillful in\r\nputting on the bags. Despite the trouble and cost of bagging, growers\r\nseeking to produce a fancy product find that the expenditure proves\r\nprofitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER-PROTECTION OF GRAPES\r\n\r\nWith a little care as to winter-protection, grapes may be grown\r\nprofitably in northern regions where, without protection, the vines\r\nare killed or injured by low temperatures. Indeed, it is little short\r\nof amazing how well grapes can be grown in northern regions where\r\nnature wears a most austere countenance in winter, if hardy early\r\nsorts are planted in warm soils and situations, and the vines are\r\ncovered in the winter. Occasionally one finds grapes grown profitably\r\nin commercial vineyards in the northern states in regions where\r\nprotection must be given to prevent winter-killing, the extra work of\r\ngiving protection being more than offset by the high price received in\r\nlocal markets for the fruit.\r\n\r\nIn all locations in which winter-protection must be given, several\r\nother precautions are helpful or even necessary. Thus, cultivation\r\nmust cease early in the season, and a cover-crop be sown to help\r\nharden and mature the vines. The grapes, also, must not be planted in\r\nsoils rich in nitrogen, and nitrogenous fertilizers must be applied\r\nwith care. The pruning should be such as does not induce great growth.\r\nThese simple precautions to hasten maturity often suffice in climates\r\nwhere the danger of winter-killing is but slight, but where danger is\r\nimminent the vines must be covered either by wrapping or by laying\r\ndown. Wrapping with straw may suffice for a few vines, but when many\r\nvines are to be protected, laying them down is cheaper and much more\r\neffectual.\r\n\r\nBy laying down is meant that the vines must be placed on the ground\r\nand there be protected by earth and snow or other covering. It is\r\nobvious that to protect thus, the vines must receive special training;\r\notherwise the trunks may be too stiff for bending. Some method of\r\ntraining must be chosen in which renewals may be made rather\r\nfrequently from the ground so that if the trunks become large, clumsy\r\nand unpliable, a more manageable trunk can be trained. If the\r\nprovisions for renewal are kept in mind, any one of the several\r\nmethods of training grapes explained in Chapter VIII on training may\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\nLaying down must be preceded by pruning, after which the arms and\r\ntrunk are loosened from the wires and bent to the ground. Bending is\r\nfacilitated by removing a spade full of earth from the side of the\r\nvine in the direction in which the vine is to be bent. The trunk is\r\nthen laid on the earth and sufficient soil placed on it to keep it in\r\nplace on the ground. If the danger of winter-killing is great because\r\nof the tenderness of the variety or the austerity of the climate, it\r\noften becomes necessary to cover the whole plant lightly with earth.\r\nSmall growers often make use of coarse manure, straw, corn-stalks or\r\nsimilar covering, in which case the vines are held on the ground by\r\nfence-rails or other timbers; but protecting with material that must\r\nbe brought into the vineyard is expensive and not more satisfactory\r\nthan earth.\r\n\r\nThe vines can be put down at any time after the leaves drop and before\r\nthe earth begins to freeze. It is more important that the vines be\r\ntaken up at the proper time in the spring. If uncovered too early and\r\ncold weather follows, injury may result and more harm be done than if\r\nthe vines had not been covered. On the other hand, if the earth is\r\npermitted to remain too long, foliage and vine are tender both to\r\nsunshine and frost. A grape-grower in New York who has had much\r\nexperience in laying down vines in a vineyard of some thirty or forty\r\nacres says that the work may be done at a cost of $6 an acre at the\r\naverage wage paid for farm-labor. It must be expected in a large\r\nplantation, no matter how well the work of covering is done, that\r\noccasionally a trunk will be broken, making it necessary to graft the\r\nvine if a shoot does not spring up from below the break.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIPENING DATES AND LENGTH OF SEASON FOR GRAPES\r\n\r\nEvery grape-grower should know when his varieties may be expected to\r\nripen and the length of season that they will keep. The commercial\r\nfruit-grower by all means should have this information. It is not\r\nsufficient that he know only roughly at what season his varieties\r\nripen; for, to take the turn of the market, he must know exactly when\r\na variety will ripen and how long it will keep. He needs this\r\ninformation, also, that he may distribute his labor better throughout\r\nthe picking season.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the data as to ripening time given by originators\r\nand introducers of varieties are not always reliable. This\r\nuntrustworthiness of data is readily accounted for in several ways:\r\nFirst, growers do not generally agree as to when grapes are ripe nor\r\nas to how long they are fit to eat. Again, much confusion as to when\r\nvarieties ripen and how long they will keep arises from the fact that\r\ngrapes ripen at different times in different places, and it is\r\ndifficult for the grape-grower in Maine to make allowance in season\r\nfor varieties, the time of ripening of which is given for Maryland.\r\nThere are also other causes than the seasonal differences in grape\r\nregions for variability in ripening time; thus, some soils are warmer\r\nand quicker than others, and on these grapes ripen earlier.\r\nApplication of nitrogenous fertilizers may delay the period of\r\nripening somewhat. Grapes ripen perceptibly earlier on old plants than\r\non young ones. Lastly, every vineyard in a particular region has its\r\nown particular climate caused by the lay of land, nearness to water,\r\nair currents and altitude which cause small differences in ripening.\r\n\r\nThe following table taken from Bulletin No. 408 of the New York\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station gives the ripening dates of grapes at\r\nGeneva, New York. It is necessary that the reader know something about\r\nthe conditions affecting the ripening time at Geneva. The latitude is\r\n42° 50' 46\". The altitude is 525 feet above sea level. The vineyard\r\nlies a mile west of a relatively large body of water. The soil is a\r\ncold heavy clay which must delay ripening time somewhat. The land is\r\nlevel. The data are given as an average for three seasons, 1913-1915.\r\n\r\nThe figures given for \"weeks in common storage\" cover a variable\r\nnumber of years, but for all varieties three or more years. The\r\ngrapes, after being picked, were at once placed in common storage in a\r\nroom on the second floor of a building. There conditions were not\r\nideal, and no doubt the season of storage would have been prolonged\r\nsomewhat had the fruit been kept in a better storage-room.\r\n\r\nTABLE V.--SHOWING THE RIPENING

Lucile (×1/2).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nGRAPE BOTANY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe grape-grower must know the gross structure and the habits of\r\ngrowth of the plants properly to propagate, transplant, prune and\r\notherwise care for the grape. Certainly he must have knowledge of the\r\nseveral species from which varieties come if he is to know the kinds\r\nof grapes, understand their adaptations to soils and climates, their\r\nrelation to insects and fungi, and their value for table, wine,\r\ngrape-juice and other purposes. Fortunately, the botany of the grape\r\nis comparatively simple. The organs of vine and fruit are distinctive\r\nand easily discerned and there are no nearly related plants cultivated\r\nfor fruit with which the grape can possibly be confused. Botanists, it\r\nis true, have dug pitfalls for those who seek exact knowledge as to\r\nthe names and characters of the many species, but, fortunately, each\r\nof the cultivated species constitutes a natural group so distinct that\r\nthe grape-grower can hardly mistake one for another in either fruit or\r\nvine.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANT CHARACTERS AND GROWTH HABITS OF THE GRAPE\r\n\r\nA grape plant is a complex organism with its many separate parts\r\nespecially developed to do one or a few kinds of work. The part of a\r\nplant devoted to one or a group of functions is called an organ. The\r\nchief organs of the plant are the root, stem, bud, flower, leaf, fruit\r\nand seed. Flowers and leaves, it is true, develop from buds and the\r\nseeds are parts of the fruits, but for descriptive purposes the vine\r\nmay well be divided into the parts named. These chief organs are\r\nfurther divided as follows:\r\n\r\n_The root._\r\n\r\n    _Root-crown_: The region of the plant in which root and stem\r\n                  unite.\r\n    _Tap-root_: The prolongation of the stem plunging vertically\r\n                downward.\r\n    _Rootlets_: The ultimate divisions of the root; usually of one\r\n                season's growth.\r\n    _Root-tips_: The extreme ends of the rootlets.\r\n\r\nThe roots of some species of the grape are soft and succulent as those\r\nof _V. vinifera_, while the same organs in other species, as in most\r\nAmerican grapes, are hard and fibrous. They may also be few or\r\nnumerous, deep or shallow, spreading or restricted, fibrous or\r\nnon-fibrous. The structure of the root thus becomes important in\r\ndistinguishing species.\r\n\r\n_The stem._\r\n\r\n    _Stem or trunk_: The unbranched main axis of the plant above\r\n                     ground.\r\n    _Branches or arms_: Main divisions of the trunk.\r\n    _Head_: The region from which branches arise.\r\n    _Old wood_: Parts of the vine older than one year.\r\n    _Canes_: Wood of the current season.\r\n    _Spurs_: Short pieces of the bases of canes; usually one or two\r\n             nodes with a bud each.\r\n    _Renewal spurs_: Spurs left to bear canes the following year.\r\n    _Shoots_: Newly developed succulent stems with their leaves.\r\n    _Fruit-shoots_: Flower and fruit-bearing shoots.\r\n    _Wood-shoots_: Shoots which bear leaves only.\r\n    _Laterals_: Secondary shoots arising from main shoots.\r\n    _Water sprouts_: Shoots arising from adventitious buds.\r\n    _Suckers_: Shoots arising from below ground.\r\n    _Nodes_: Joints in the stem from which leaves are or may be borne.\r\n    _Internodes_: The part between two nodes.\r\n    _Diaphragm_: The woody tissue which interrupts the pith at the\r\n                 node.\r\n    _Bloom_: The powdery coating on the cane.\r\n    _Tendril_: The coiled, thread-like organ by which the vine grasps\r\n               an object and clings to it.\r\n\r\nSpecies of grapes have very characteristic vines. A glance at a vine\r\nenables one to tell the European grape from any of the American\r\ngrapes; so, also, one is able to distinguish most of the American\r\nspecies by the aspect of the vine. Many varieties of any species of\r\ngrape are readily told by the size and habits of the plant. Size of\r\nvine is rather more variable than other gross characters because of\r\nthe influence of environment, such as food, moisture, light, isolation\r\nand pests; yet, size in a plant or the parts of a plant is a very\r\nreliable character when proper allowances are made for environment.\r\n\r\nThe degree of hardiness is a very important diagnostic character in\r\ndetermining both species and varieties of grapes and very largely\r\nindicates their value for the vineyard. Thus, the varieties of the\r\nEuropean grape are less hardy than the peach, while our American\r\nLabruscas and Vulpinas are as hardy as the apple. The range of\r\nvarieties as to hardiness falls within that of the species, and\r\ncultivated varieties hardier than the wild grape are not found. Grapes\r\nare designated in descriptions of varieties and species as hardy,\r\nhalf-hardy and tender.\r\n\r\nHabit of growth varies but little with changing conditions and is thus\r\nan important means of distinguishing species and varieties and not\r\ninfrequently stamps the variety as fit or unfit for the vineyard.\r\nHabit of growth gives aspect to the vine. Thus, a vine may be upright,\r\ndrooping, horizontal, stocky, straggling, spreading, dense or open.\r\nThe vine may grow rapidly or slowly and may be long-lived or\r\nshort-lived; the trunk may be short and stocky or long and slender.\r\nThese several characters largely determine whether a vine is\r\nmanageable in the vineyard. Productiveness, age of bearing and\r\nregularity of bearing are distinctive characters with cultivated\r\ngrapes. The care given the vine influences these characters; yet all\r\nare helpful in identifying species and varieties and all must be\r\nconsidered by the grape-grower.\r\n\r\nImmunity and susceptibility to diseases and insects are most valuable\r\ndiagnostic characters of species and varieties of grapes. Thus,\r\nspecies differ widely in resistance to phylloxera, the grape-louse, to\r\nthe grape leaf-hopper, the flea-beetle, berry-moth, root-worm,\r\npowdery-mildew, downy-mildew, anthracnose and other insect and fungous\r\ntroubles of this fruit.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the bark is an important distinguishing character for\r\nsome species, but is of little importance in identifying the variety\r\nand has no economic value to the fruit-grower. In most species of\r\ngrapes, the bark has distinct lenticels and on the old wood separates\r\nin long thin strips and fibers; but in two species from southeastern\r\nNorth America, the bark bears prominent lenticels and never shreds.\r\nSmoothness, color and thickness are other attributes of the bark to be\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nCanes of different species vary greatly in total length and in length\r\nof internodes. They vary also in size, in number and in color, while\r\nthe shape in some species is quite distinctive, being in some round,\r\nin others angular and in still others flattened. The direction of\r\ngrowth in canes, whether sinuous, straight or zigzag, is an important\r\ncharacter. Nodes and internodes are indicative characters in some\r\nspecies, being more or less prominent, angular or flattened, while the\r\ninternodes are long or short.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm distinguishes several species of grapes. The cane\r\ncontains a large pith and this in most species is interrupted by woody\r\ntissue, forming a diaphragm at the nodes. In the Rotundifolia grapes\r\nthe diaphragm is absent, while in several other American species it is\r\nvery thin and in still others quite thick. The character of the\r\ndiaphragm is best observed in year-old canes. In studying the\r\ndiaphragm, notice should be taken also of the pith, which is very\r\nvariable in size.\r\n\r\nYoung shoots of the grape offer a ready means of distinguishing\r\nspecies and varieties through their color and the amount and\r\ncharacter of the pubescence. Shoots may be glabrous, pubescent or\r\nhairy and even spiny.\r\n\r\nThe tendril is one of the organs most used in determining species and\r\nvarieties of grapes. In some species, as _V. Labrusca_, there is a\r\ntendril or an inflorescence opposite nearly every leaf, continuous\r\ntendrils. All other species have two leaves with a tendril opposite\r\neach and a third leaf without a tendril, intermittent tendrils. To\r\nstudy this organ it is necessary to have vigorous, healthy, typical\r\ncanes. Tendrils may be long or short, stout or slender; simple,\r\nbifurcated or trifurcated; or smooth, pubescent or warty.\r\n\r\nThe number of inflorescences borne by species is an important\r\ncharacter in some cases. All species, excepting _V. Labrusca_, average\r\ntwo inflorescences to a cane, but _V. Labrusca_ may bear from three to\r\nsix inflorescences, each in the place of a tendril opposite the leaf.\r\n\r\n_The bud._\r\n\r\n    _Bud_: An undeveloped shoot.\r\n    _Fruit-bud_: A bud in which a shoot bearing flowers originates.\r\n    _Wood-bud_: A bud in which a shoot bearing only leaves originates.\r\n    _Latent bud_: A bud which remains dormant for one or more seasons.\r\n    _Adventitious bud_: A bud arising elsewhere than the normal\r\n                        position at a node.\r\n    _Eye_: A compound bud.\r\n    _Main bud_: The central bud of an eye.\r\n    _Secondary bud_: The lateral bud of an eye.\r\n\r\nBuds of different species of grapes vary greatly in time of opening as\r\nthey do somewhat in varieties, so that the time the buds begin to\r\nswell is a fine mark of distinction. The angle at which the bud stands\r\nout from the branch is of some value in determining species.\r\nDifferences in color, size, shape, position and amount of pubescence\r\nof buds must all be noted in describing grapes. The scales of the buds\r\nvary more or less in size and in thickness.\r\n\r\n_The flower._\r\n\r\n    _Staminate_: Having stamens and not pistils; a male flower.\r\n    _Pistillate_: Having pistils and not stamens; a female flower.\r\n    _Dioecious_: Said when the stamens are on one plant and the\r\n                 pistils on another.\r\n    _Polygamous_: Said when flowers on a plant are in part perfect\r\n                  (having both stamens and pistils) while others are\r\n                  staminate or pistillate.\r\n    _Hermaphrodite_: Said of a flower having both stamens and pistils.\r\n    _Fertile_: Said of a flower capable of bearing seed without pollen\r\n               from another flower.\r\n    _Sterile_: Said of a flower without or with abortive pistils.\r\n    _Perfect_: Said of a flower having both stamens and pistils.\r\n    _Imperfect_: Said of a flower wanting either stamens or pistils.\r\n    _Peduncle_: The stalk of a flower-cluster.\r\n    _Pedicel_: The stalk of each particular flower.\r\n\r\nThe time of bloom is an easy mark of distinction between several\r\nspecies of grapes and helps to distinguish varieties in a species as\r\nwell. Most species of grapes bear fertile flowers on one vine and\r\nsterile flowers on another and are, therefore, polygamous-dioecious.\r\nSterile vines bear male flowers with abortive pistils so that, while\r\nthey never produce fruits themselves, they usually assist in\r\nfertilizing others. Fertile flowers are capable of ripening fruits\r\nwithout cross-pollination. Vines with female flowers only are seldom\r\nfound. In most species of the grape, plants with sterile flowers and\r\nthose with complete flowers are found mixed in the wild state, but\r\nusually only the fertile plants have been selected for cultivation.\r\nPlants raised from seeds of any of the species, however, furnish many\r\nsterile vines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53. The grape flower. I. Opening bud showing the\r\nway in which the cap becomes loosened at the base. II. Diagrammatic\r\nillustration of grape stamens.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe degree of fertility of blossoms is also a fine mark of distinction\r\nin species and varieties of the grape. Fertile vines are of two kinds\r\nin most species. The flowers on one kind are perfect hermaphrodites,\r\nwhile in the other kind the stamens are smaller and shorter than the\r\npistil and eventually bent down and curved under. The two kinds of\r\nstamens are shown in Figs. 53 and 54. These may be called imperfect\r\nhermaphrodites since they are seldom as fruitful as the perfect\r\nhermaphrodites unless fertilized from another plant. Examined with a\r\nmicroscope, it is found that self-sterile plants usually bear abortive\r\npollen and that the percentage of abortive pollen grains varies\r\ngreatly in different varieties. The upright or depressed stamen does\r\nnot always indicate the condition of the pollen, since there are many\r\ninstances in which upright stamens bear impotent pollen and\r\noccasionally the depressed stamens bear perfect pollen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54. Grape flowers. _Left_, upright stamens of\r\nDelaware; _right_, depressed stamens of Brighton.]\r\n\r\n_The leaf._\r\n\r\n    _Blade_: The expanded portion of the leaf.\r\n    _Lobe_: The more or less rounded division of the leaf.\r\n    _Sinus_: The recess or bay between two lobes.\r\n    _Petiole_: The leaf-stalk.\r\n    _Petiolar sinus_: The sinus about the petiole.\r\n    _Basal sinuses_: The two sinuses toward the base of the blade.\r\n    _Lateral sinuses_: The two sinuses toward the apex of the blade.\r\n\r\nThe size, shape and color of the leaves are quite distinctive of\r\nspecies and more or less so of varieties, if allowances are made for\r\nvariation due to environment. The lobing of leaves is a very uniform\r\ncharacter in most species, some having lobes and others having entire\r\nleaves. The upper surface of the leaf in some species is smooth,\r\nglossy and shiny and in others is rough and dull. The lower surface\r\nshows similar variations and has, besides, varying amounts of\r\npubescence, down and bloom. In some species the down resembles\r\ncobwebs. The number, size and shape of the lobes are important in\r\ndistinguishing both varieties and species, as are also the petiolar,\r\nbasal and lateral sinuses. As in most plants, the margins of the\r\nleaves, whether serrate, dentate or crenate, are often distinguishing\r\ncharacters. The petiole in different species varies from short to long\r\nand from stout to slender. Lastly, the time at which the leaves fall\r\nis often a good distinguishing mark.\r\n\r\n_The fruit._\r\n\r\n    _Peduncle and pedicel_: Defined as in flower.\r\n    _Brush_: The end of the pedicel projecting into the fruit.\r\n    _Base_: The point of attachment of bunch or berry.\r\n    _Apex_: The point opposite the base.\r\n    _Bloom_: The powdery coating on the fruit.\r\n    _Pigment_: The coloring matter in the skin.\r\n    _Quality_: The combination of characters that makes grapes\r\n               pleasant to the palate, sight, smell and touch.\r\n    _Foxiness_: The rancid taste and smell of some grapes which are\r\n                similar to the effluvium of a fox.\r\n\r\nOf all organs the fruit is most responsive to changed conditions and\r\nhence most variable. Yet the fruits furnish most valuable characters\r\nfor determining both species and varieties. Size, shape, compactness\r\nand the number of clusters on a shoot must be noted. Coming to the\r\nberry, size, shape, color, bloom, adherence of stigma to the apex and\r\nadhesion of fruit to the pedicel are all of value. Difference in\r\nadherence of the skin to the pulp separates European from all American\r\ngrapes. The thickness, toughness, flavor and pigment of the skin have\r\nmore or less value. The color, firmness, juiciness, aroma and flavor\r\nof the flesh, as well as its adherence to seed and skin, are valuable\r\nmarks in describing grapes. All species and varieties are well\r\ndistinguished by the time of ripening and by keeping quality. The\r\ncolor of the juice is a plain and certain dividing line between some\r\nspecies and many varieties.\r\n\r\n_The seed._\r\n\r\n    _Beak_: The narrow prolonged base of the seed.\r\n    _Hilum_: The scar left where the seed was attached to the\r\n             seed-stalk.\r\n    _Chalaza_: The place where the seed-coats and kernel are\r\n               connected.\r\n    _Raphe_: The line or ridge which runs from the hilum to the\r\n             chalaza.\r\n\r\nSeeds are accounted of much value in determining species. The size and\r\nweight of seed differ greatly in different species, as they do also in\r\nvarieties of any one species. Thus, of native grapes, Labrusca has the\r\nlargest and heaviest seeds and Vulpina has the smallest seed, while\r\nthose of Æstivalis are of medium size and weight. The shape and color\r\nof seed offer distinguishing marks, while the size, shape and position\r\nof the raphe and chalaza furnish very certain marks of distinction in\r\nsome species.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENUS VITIS\r\n\r\nThe genus Vitis belongs to the vine family (Vitaceæ) in which most\r\nbotanists also put the wood-vines (Ampelopsis), of which Virginia\r\ncreeper is the best-known plant. The genus Cissus, to which belong\r\nmany southern climbers, is combined with Vitis by some botanists.\r\nVitis is separated from Ampelopsis and Cissus by marked differences in\r\nseveral organs, of which, horticulturally at least, those in the\r\nfruit best serve to distinguish the group. Species of Vitis, with\r\npossibly one or two exceptions, bear pulpy edible fruits; species of\r\nAmpelopsis and Cissus bear fruits with pulp so scant that the berries\r\nare inedible. Vitis is further distinguished as follows: The plants\r\nare climbing or trailing, rarely shrubby, with woody stems and mostly\r\nwith coiling, naked-tipped tendrils. The leaves are simple, palmately\r\nlobed, round-dentate or heart-shaped-dentate. The stipules are small,\r\nfalling early. The flowers are polygamo-dioecious (some plants with\r\nperfect flowers, others staminate with at most a rudimentary ovary),\r\nfive-parted. The petals are separated only at the base and fall off\r\nwithout expanding. The disk is hypogynous with five nectariferous\r\nglands which are alternate with the stamens. The berry is globose or\r\novoid, few-seeded and pulpy. The seeds are pyriform and beak-like at\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIES OF AMERICAN GRAPES\r\n\r\nThe number of species of grapes in the world depends on the arbitrary\r\nlimits set for a species of this fruit, and knowledge of the genus is\r\nyet too meager to set these limits with certainty. Indeed, the men who\r\nhave made grape species have seldom been able to outline the habitats\r\nof their groups with much certainty. In habitat, it should be said,\r\ngrapes are confined almost wholly to temperate and subtropical\r\nregions. However, the grape-grower is not much concerned with species\r\nof grapes other than those that have horticultural value. Of these, in\r\nAmerica, there are now ten more or less cultivated either for fruit or\r\nfor stocks. The following descriptions of these ten species are\r\nadapted from the author's The Grapes of New York, published in 1908 by\r\nthe state of New York (Chapter IV, pages 107-156).\r\n\r\nCONSPECTUS OF CULTIVATED SPECIES OF VITIS\r\n\r\n    _A._ Skin of mature berry separating freely from the pulp.\r\n      _B._ Nodes without diaphragms; tendrils simple.\r\n                                                 1. _V. rotundifolia._\r\n                                                 2. _V.

Muscadine Grape. Bull Grape. Bullet\r\nGrape. Bushy Grape. Bullace Grape. Scuppernong. Southern Fox Grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, sometimes, when without support, shrubby and\r\n    only three or four feet high; when growing in the shade often\r\n    sending down aërial roots. Wood hard, bark smooth, not scaling,\r\n    with prominent warty lenticels; shoots short-jointed, angled, with\r\n    fine scurfy pubescence; diaphragms absent; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    simple. Leaves small, broadly cordate or roundish; petiolar sinus\r\n    wide, shallow; margin with obtuse, wide teeth; not lobed; dense in\r\n    texture, light green color, glabrous above, sometimes pubescent\r\n    along veins below. Cluster small (6-24 berries), loose; peduncle\r\n    short; pedicels short, thick. Berries large, globular or somewhat\r\n    oblate, black or greenish-yellow; skin thick, tough and with a\r\n    musky odor; pulp tough; ripening unevenly and dropping as soon as\r\n    ripe. Seeds flattened, shallowly and broadly notched; beak very\r\n    short; chalaza narrow, slightly depressed with radiating ridges\r\n    and furrows; raphe a narrow groove. Leafing, flowering and\r\n    ripening fruit very late.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of this species is southern Delaware, west through\r\nTennessee, southern Illinois, southeastern Missouri, Arkansas (except\r\nthe northwestern portions), to Grayson County, Texas, as a northern\r\nand western boundary, to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf on the east\r\nand south. It becomes rare as one approaches the western limit but is\r\ncommon in many sections of the great region outlined above, being most\r\nabundant on sandy, well-drained bottom lands and along river banks and\r\nin swampy, thick woodlands and thickets. The climate most suitable for\r\nRotundifolia is that in which cotton grows, and it thrives best in the\r\nlower portions of the cotton-belt of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Rotundifolia is very characteristic. The skin is thick,\r\nhas a leathery appearance, adheres strongly to the underlying flesh\r\nand is marked with lenticel-like russet dots. The flesh is more or\r\nless tough but the toughness is not localized around the seed as in\r\nthe case of Labrusca. The fruit and most of the varieties of the\r\nspecies are characterized by a strong, musky aroma and are lacking in\r\nsugar and acid. Some varieties yield over four gallons of must to the\r\nbushel. Wine-makers are divided in opinion as to its value for\r\nwine-making, but at present the most promising outlook for\r\nRotundifolia varieties is as wine, grape-juice and culinary grapes.\r\nRotundifolia does not produce fruit suitable for shipping as dessert\r\ngrapes chiefly because the berries ripen unevenly and when ripe drop\r\nfrom the cluster. The common method of gathering the fruit of this\r\nspecies is to shake the vines at intervals so that the ripe berries\r\ndrop on sheets spread below the vines. The juice which exudes from the\r\npoint where the stem is broken off causes the berries to become\r\nsmeared and gives them an unattractive appearance. Owing, however, to\r\nthe tough skin, the berries do not crack as badly as other grapes\r\nwould under the same conditions, but nevertheless they are not adapted\r\nto long-distance shipments. Under reasonably favorable conditions, the\r\nvines attain great age and size and when grown on arbors, as they\r\noften are, and without pruning, they cover a large area.\r\n\r\nRotundifolia is remarkably resistant to the attacks of all insects and\r\nto fungal diseases. The phylloxera do not attack its roots and it is\r\nconsidered as resistant as any other, if not the most resistant of all\r\nAmerican species. The vines are grown from cuttings only with\r\ndifficulty and this prevents the use of this species as a resistant\r\nstock. However, under favorable circumstances, and with skillful\r\nhandling, this is a successful method of propagation. Under\r\nunfavorable circumstances, or when only a few vines are desired, it is\r\nbetter to depend on layers. As a stock upon which to graft other\r\nvines, this species has not been a success. There is great difficulty\r\nin crossing Rotundifolia with other species, but several Rotundifolia\r\nhybrids are now on record.\r\n\r\n2. _Vitis Munsoniana_, Simpson. Florida Grape. Everbearing grape. Bird\r\nGrape. Mustang Grape of Florida.\r\n\r\n    Vine slender, usually running on the ground or over low bushes.\r\n    Canes angular; internodes short; tendrils intermittent, simple.\r\n    Leaves smaller and thinner than Rotundifolia and rather more\r\n    circular in outline; not lobed; teeth open and spreading; petiolar\r\n    sinus V-shaped; both surfaces smooth, rather light green. Cluster\r\n    with more berries but about the same size as in Rotundifolia.\r\n    Berry one-third to one-half the diameter, with thinner and more\r\n    tender skin; black, shining; pulp less solid, more acid and\r\n    without muskiness. Seeds about one-half the size of those of\r\n    Rotundifolia, similar in other respects. Leafing, flowering and\r\n    ripening fruit very late.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of _V. Munsoniana_ is central and southern Florida and the\r\nFlorida Keys. It extends south of the habitat of Rotundifolia and\r\nblends into this species at their point of meeting. Munsoniana appears\r\nto be a variation of Rotundifolia, fitted to subtropical conditions.\r\nIt is tender, not enduring a lower temperature than zero. In the\r\nmatter of multiplication, it differs from _V. rotundifolia_ in that it\r\ncan be propagated readily from cuttings. Like Rotundifolia it is\r\nresistant to phylloxera.\r\n\r\n3. _Vitis rupestris_, Scheele. Mountain Grape. Rock Grape. Bush Grape.\r\nSand Grape. Sugar Grape. Beach Grape.\r\n\r\n    A small, much branched shrub or, under favorable circumstances,\r\n    climbing. Diaphragm thin; tendrils few, or if present, weak,\r\n    usually deciduous. Leaves small; young leaves frequently folded on\r\n    midrib; broadly cordate or reniform, wider than long, scarcely\r\n    ever lobed, smooth, glabrous on both surfaces at maturity;\r\n    petiolar sinus wide, shallow; margin coarsely toothed, frequently\r\n    a sharp, abrupt point at terminal. Cluster small. Berries small,\r\n    black or purple-black. Seeds small, not notched; beak short,\r\n    blunt; raphe distinct to indistinct, usually showing as a narrow\r\n    groove; chalaza pear-shaped, sometimes distinct, but usually a\r\n    depression only. Leafing, blossoming and ripening early.\r\n\r\nThis species is an inhabitant of southwestern Texas, extending\r\neastward and northward into New Mexico, southern Missouri, Indiana and\r\nTennessee to southern Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. Its\r\nfavorite places are gravelly banks and bars of mountain streams or the\r\nrocky beds of dry watercourses. This species is rather variable both\r\nin type and growth. It was introduced into France at about the same\r\ntime as Vulpina, and the French vineyardists selected the most\r\nvigorous and healthy forms for grafting stock. These pass under the\r\nvarious names of Rupestris Mission, Rupestris du Lot, Rupestris\r\nGanzin, Rupestris Martin, Rupestris St. George and others. In France,\r\nthese varieties have given particularly good results on bare, rocky\r\nsoils with hot, dry exposures. In California, Rupestris does not\r\nflourish in dry locations, and as it suckers profusely and does not\r\ntake the graft as readily as Vulpina and Æstivalis, it is not largely\r\npropagated.\r\n\r\nThe clusters of fruit are small, with berries about the size of a\r\ncurrant and varying from sweet to sour. The berry is characterized by\r\nmuch pigment under the skin. The fruit has a sprightly taste wholly\r\nfree from any disagreeable foxiness. Rupestris under cultivation is\r\nsaid to be very resistant to rot and mildew of the foliage. The vine\r\nis considered hardy in the Southwest. The attention of hybridizers was\r\nattracted to this species over thirty years ago, and various hybrids\r\nhave been produced of great promise for grape-breeding. The root\r\nsystem of Rupestris is peculiar in that the roots penetrate at once\r\ndeeply into the ground instead of extending laterally as in other\r\nspecies. Like those of Vulpina, the roots are slender, hard and\r\nresistant to phylloxera. The species is easily propagated by cuttings.\r\nThe vines bench-graft readily but are difficult to handle in field\r\ngrafting.\r\n\r\n4. _Vitis vulpina_, Linn. (_V. riparia_, Michx.). Winter Grape. River\r\nGrape. Riverside Grape. Riverbank Grape. Sweet-scented Grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, climbing. Shoots cylindrical or angled,\r\n    usually smooth, slender; diaphragms thin; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    slender, usually bifid. Leaves with large stipules; leaf-blade\r\n    large, thin, entire, three- or lower ones often five-lobed;\r\n    sinuses shallow, angular; petiolar sinus broad, usually shallow;\r\n    margin with incised, sharply serrate teeth of variable size; light\r\n    green, glabrous above, glabrous but sometimes pubescent on ribs\r\n    and veins below. Cluster small, compact, shouldered; peduncle\r\n    short. Berries small, black with a heavy blue bloom. Seeds two to\r\n    four, small, notched, short, plump, with very short beak; chalaza\r\n    narrowly oval, depressed, indistinct; raphe usually a groove,\r\n    sometimes distinct. Very variable in flavor and time of ripening.\r\n\r\nVulpina is the most widely distributed of any American species of\r\ngrape. It has been discovered in parts of Canada north of Quebec and\r\nfrom thence southward to the Gulf of Mexico. It is found from the\r\nAtlantic coast westward, most botanists say, to the Rocky Mountains.\r\nUsually it grows on river banks, on islands or in upland ravines.\r\nVulpina has always been considered of great promise in the evolution\r\nof American grapes. It can hardly be said that it has fulfilled\r\nexpectations, there probably being no pure variety of this species of\r\nmore than local importance, and the results of hybridizing it with\r\nother species have not been wholly successful. Attention was early\r\nturned to Vulpina because of the qualities presented by the vine\r\nrather than those of the fruit, particularly its hardiness and vigor.\r\nHowever, both of these qualities are rather variable, although it is\r\nonly reasonable to suppose that in such a widely distributed species,\r\nplants found in a certain region would have adapted themselves to the\r\nconditions there present; thus, it should be expected that the\r\nnorthern plants would be more hardy than those from the South, and\r\nthat the western prairie forms would be more capable of resisting\r\ndrouth than those from humid regions. It is, consequently, impossible\r\nto say what conditions best suit this species. It may be said,\r\nhowever, that Vulpina is adapted to a great variety of soils and\r\nlocations; vines have withstood a temperature of 40 to 60 degrees\r\nbelow zero and they show equal ability in withstanding the injurious\r\neffects of high temperatures in the summer. On account of its habit of\r\nearly blooming, the blossoms sometimes suffer from late frosts in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nWhile Vulpina is not a swamp grape and is not found growing under\r\nswampy conditions, it is fond of water. In the semi-arid regions\r\nalways, and in humid regions usually, it is found growing along the\r\nbanks of streams, in ravines, on the islands of rivers and in wet\r\nplaces. It is not nearly so capable of withstanding drouth as\r\nRupestris. Vulpina likes a rather rich soil, but in France has been\r\nfound to do poorly on limestone land and calcareous marls. The French\r\ntell us, however, that this is a characteristic of all our American\r\ngrapes, and that Vulpina is more resistant to the injurious effects of\r\nan excess of lime than either Rupestris or Æstivalis.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Vulpina is usually small, there being occasional\r\nvarieties of medium size or above. The clusters are of medium size\r\nand, if judged from the standpoint of number of berries, might\r\nfrequently be called large. The flavor is usually sharply acid but\r\nfree from foxiness or any disagreeable wild taste. If eaten in\r\nquantity, the acidity is likely to affect the lips and end of the\r\ntongue. When the acidity is somewhat ameliorated, as in the case of\r\nthoroughly ripe or even over-ripe and shriveled fruit, the flavor is\r\nmuch liked. The flesh is neither pulpy nor solid and dissolves in the\r\nmouth and separates readily from the seed. The must of Vulpina is\r\ncharacterized by an average amount of sugar, varying considerably in\r\nthe fruit from different vines, and by an excess of acid.\r\n\r\nVulpina is very resistant to phylloxera, the roots are small, hard,\r\nnumerous and branch freely. The roots feed close to the surface and do\r\nnot seem to be well adapted to forcing their way through heavy clays.\r\nVulpina grows readily from cuttings and makes a good stock for\r\ngrafting, its union with other species being usually permanent. When\r\nVulpinas were first sent to France to be used as a stock in\r\nreconstituting the French vineyards, it was found that many of the\r\nvines secured from the woods were too weak in growth to support the\r\nstronger-growing Viniferas. On this account the French growers\r\nselected the more vigorous forms of the Vulpinas, to which they gave\r\nvarietal names, as Vulpina Gloire, Vulpina Grand Glabre, Vulpina\r\nSchribner, Vulpina Martin and others. With these selected Vulpinas,\r\nthe graft does not outgrow the stock. Vulpina is less resistant to\r\nblack-rot than Æstivalis but somewhat more resistant than Labrusca.\r\nThe foliage is rarely attacked by mildew. One of the chief failings\r\nof this species is the susceptibility of the leaves to the attack of\r\nthe leaf-hopper. The Vulpinas are generally late in ripening; the\r\nfruit is better in quality in long seasons and should be left on the\r\nvines as late as possible.\r\n\r\n5. _Vitis cordifolia_, Michx. Winter Grape. Frost Grape. Fox Grape.\r\nChicken Grape. Heart-leaved Vitis. Possum Grape. Sour Winter Grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, climbing. Shoots slender; internodes long,\r\n    angular, usually glabrous, sometimes pubescent; diaphragms thick;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, long, usually bifid. Leaves with short,\r\n    broad stipules; leaf-blade medium to large, cordate, entire or\r\n    indistinctly three-lobed; petiolar sinus deep, usually narrow,\r\n    acute; margin with coarse angular teeth; point of leaf acuminate;\r\n    upper surface light green, glossy, glabrous; glabrous or sparingly\r\n    pubescent below. Clusters medium to large, loose, with long\r\n    peduncle. Berries numerous and small, black, shining, little or no\r\n    bloom. Seeds medium in size, broad, beak short; chalaza oval or\r\n    roundish, elevated, very distinct; raphe a distinct, cord-like\r\n    ridge. Fruit sour and astringent and frequently consisting of\r\n    little besides skins and seeds. Leafing, flowering and ripening\r\n    fruit very late.\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that Cordifolia and Vulpina have been badly\r\nconfused, the limits of the habitat of this species are difficult to\r\ndetermine. The best authorities give the northern limit as New York or\r\nthe Great Lakes. The eastern limit is the Atlantic Ocean and the\r\nsouthern limit, the Gulf of Mexico. It extends westward, according to\r\nEngelmann, to the western limits of the wooded portion of the\r\nMississippi Valley in the North, and, according to Munson, to the\r\nBrazos River, Texas, in the South. It is found along creeks and river\r\nbanks sometimes mixed with Vulpina, having about the same soil\r\nadaptations as that species. It is a very common species in the middle\r\nstates and frequently grows on limestone soils, but is not indigenous\r\nto such soils.\r\n\r\nCordifolia makes a good stock for grafting, being vigorous and forming\r\na good union with most of our cultivated grapes. It is seldom used\r\nfor this purpose, however, on account of the difficulty of propagating\r\nit by means of cuttings. For the same reason vines of it are seldom\r\nfound in cultivation.\r\n\r\n6. _Vitis Berlandieri_, Planch. Mountain-Grape. Spanish Grape. Fall\r\nGrape. Winter Grape. Little Mountain Grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, climbing; shoots more or less angled and pubescent;\r\n    pubescence remaining only in patches on mature wood; canes mostly\r\n    with short internodes; diaphragms thick; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    long, strong, bifid or trifid. Leaves with small stipules;\r\n    leaf-blade large, broadly cordate, notched or shortly three-lobed;\r\n    petiolar sinus rather open, V- or U-shaped, margin with broad but\r\n    rather shallow teeth, rather dark glossy green above, grayish\r\n    pubescence below when young; becoming glabrous and even glossy\r\n    except on ribs and veins, when mature. Clusters large, compact,\r\n    compound, with long peduncle. Berries small, black, with thin\r\n    bloom, juicy, rather tart but pleasant tasting when thoroughly\r\n    ripe. Seeds few, small, short, plump, oval or roundish, with short\r\n    beak; chalaza oval or roundish, distinct; raphe narrow, slightly\r\n    distinct to indistinct. Leafing, flowering and ripening fruit very\r\n    late.\r\n\r\nBerlandieri is a native of the limestone hills of southwest Texas and\r\nadjacent Mexico. It grows in the same region with _V. monticola_, but\r\nis less restricted locally, growing from the tops of the hills down\r\nand along the creek bottoms of these regions. Its great virtue is that\r\nit withstands a soil largely composed of lime, being superior to all\r\nother American species in this respect. This and its moderate degree\r\nof vigor have recommended it to the French growers as a stock for\r\ntheir calcareous soils. The roots are strong, thick, and very\r\nresistant to phylloxera. It is propagated by cuttings with comparative\r\nease, but its varieties are variable, some not rooting at all easily.\r\nWhile the fruit of this species shows a large cluster, the berries are\r\nsmall and sour, and Berlandieri is not regarded as having promise for\r\nculture in America.\r\n\r\n7. _Vitis æstivalis_, Michx. Blue Grape. Bunch Grape. Summer Grape.\r\nLittle Grape. Duck-shot Grape. Swamp Grape. Chicken Grape. Pigeon\r\nGrape.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, shoots pubescent or smooth when young;\r\n    diaphragms thick; tendrils intermittent, usually bifid. Leaves\r\n    with short, broad stipules; leaf-blade large, thin when young but\r\n    becoming thick; petiolar sinus deep, usually narrow, frequently\r\n    overlapping; margin rarely entire, usually three- to five-lobed;\r\n    teeth dentate, shallow, wide; upper surface dark green; lower\r\n    surface with more or less reddish or rusty pubescence which, in\r\n    mature leaves, usually shows in patches on the ribs and veins;\r\n    petioles frequently pubescent. Clusters long, not much branched,\r\n    with long peduncle. Berries small, with moderate amount of bloom,\r\n    usually astringent. Seeds two to three, of medium size, plump,\r\n    smooth, not notched; chalaza oval, distinct; raphe a distinct\r\n    cord-like ridge. Leafing and ripening fruit late to very late.\r\n\r\nThe division of the original species has reduced the habitat\r\nmaterially, confining it to the southeastern part of the United States\r\nfrom southern New York to Florida and westward to the Mississippi\r\nRiver. Æstivalis grows in thickets and openings in the woods and shows\r\nno such fondness for streams as Vulpina, or for thick timber as\r\nLabrusca, but is generally confined to uplands. Under favorable\r\ncircumstances, the vines grow to be very large. Æstivalis is\r\npreëminently a wine grape. The fruit usually has a tart, acrid taste,\r\ndue to the presence of a high percentage of acid, but there is also a\r\nlarge amount of sugar, the scale showing that juice from this species\r\nhas a much higher percentage of sugar than the sweeter-tasting\r\nLabruscas. The wine made from varieties of Æstivalis is very rich in\r\ncoloring matter and is used by some European vintners to mix with the\r\nmust of European sorts in order to give the combined product a higher\r\ncolor. The berries are destitute of pulp, have a comparatively thin,\r\ntough skin and a peculiar spicy flavor. The berries hang to the bunch\r\nafter becoming ripe much better than do those of Labrusca.\r\n\r\nThis species thrives in a lighter and shallower soil than Labrusca and\r\nappears to endure drought better, although not equaling in this\r\nrespect either Vulpina or Rupestris. The French growers report that\r\nÆstivalis is very liable to chlorosis on soils which contain much\r\nlime. The leaves are never injured by the sun and they resist the\r\nattacks of insects, such as leaf-hoppers, better than any other\r\nAmerican species under cultivation. Æstivalis is rarely injured by\r\nblack-rot or mildew, according to American experience, but French\r\ngrowers speak of its being susceptible to both. The hard roots of\r\nÆstivalis enable it to resist phylloxera, and varieties with any great\r\namount of the blood of this species are seldom seriously injured by\r\nthis insect. An objection to Æstivalis, from a horticultural\r\nstandpoint, is that it does not root well from cuttings. Many\r\nauthorities speak of it as not rooting at all from cuttings, but this\r\nis an over-statement of the facts, as many of the wild and cultivated\r\nvarieties are occasionally propagated in this manner, and some\r\nsouthern nurseries, located in particularly favorable situations, make\r\na practice of propagating it by this method. Varieties of this species\r\nbear grafting well, especially in the vineyard.\r\n\r\n_Vitis æstivalis Lincecumii_, Munson. Post-oak Grape. Pine-wood Grape.\r\nTurkey Grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, sometimes climbing high upon trees, sometimes\r\n    forming a bushy clump from two to six feet high; canes\r\n    cylindrical, much rusty wool on shoots; tendrils intermittent.\r\n    Leaves very large, almost as wide as long; entire or three-,\r\n    five-, or rarely seven-lobed; lobes frequently divided; sinuses,\r\n    including petiolar sinus, deep; smooth above, and with more or\r\n    less rusty pubescence below. (The north-Texas, southwestern\r\n    Missouri and northern Arkansas form shows little or no pubescence\r\n    but has fine prickly spines at base of shoots and shows much blue\r\n    bloom on shoots, canes and the under side of the leaves.) Fruit\r\n    small to large, usually larger than typical Æstivalis, usually\r\n    black, with heavy bloom. Seeds larger than Æstivalis, pear-shaped;\r\n    chalaza roundish.\r\n\r\nLincecumii inhabits the eastern half of Texas, western Louisiana,\r\nOklahoma, Arkansas and southern Missouri on high sandy land,\r\nfrequently climbing post-oak trees, hence the name, post-oak grape, by\r\nwhich it is locally known.\r\n\r\nLincecumii has attracted considerable attention through the work of H.\r\nJaeger and T. V. Munson in domesticating it, both of whom considered\r\nit one of the most, if not the most, promising form from which to\r\nsecure cultivated varieties for the Southwest. The qualities which\r\nrecommend it are: First, vigor; second, capacity to withstand rot and\r\nmildew; third, hardiness and capacity to endure hot and dry summers\r\nwithout injury; fourth, the large cluster and berry which were found\r\non certain of the wild vines. The fruit is characteristic because of\r\nits dense bloom, firm, yet tender texture and peculiar flavor. The\r\ncultivated varieties have given satisfaction in many sections of the\r\nCentral Western and Southern states. Like Æstivalis, it is difficult\r\nto propagate from cuttings.\r\n\r\nThe north-Texas glaucous form of this variety mentioned in the\r\ntechnical description above is the _V. æstivalis glauca_ of Bailey.\r\nThis is the type of Lincecumii that Munson has used in breeding work.\r\n\r\n_Vitis æstivalis Bourquiniana_, Bailey. Southern Æstivalis.\r\n\r\nBourquiniana differs chiefly from the type in having thinner leaves;\r\nthe shoots and under side of the leaves are only slightly\r\nreddish-brown in color; the pubescence usually disappears at maturity;\r\nthe leaves are more deeply lobed than is common in Æstivalis; and the\r\nfruit is larger, sweeter and more juicy. Bourquiniana is known only in\r\ncultivation. The name was given by Munson, who ranks the group as a\r\nspecies. He includes therein many southern varieties, the most\r\nimportant of which are: Herbemont, Bertrand, Cunningham and Lenoir,\r\ngrouped in the Herbemont section; and Devereaux, Louisiana and Warren,\r\nin the Devereaux section. Munson has traced the history of this\r\ninteresting group and states that it was brought from southern France\r\nto America over one hundred fifty years ago by the Bourquin family of\r\nSavannah, Georgia. Many botanists are of the opinion that\r\nBourquiniana is a hybrid. The hybrid supposition is corroborated to a\r\ndegree by the characters being more or less intermediate between the\r\nsupposed parent species, and also by the fact that up to date no wild\r\nform of Bourquiniana has been found. The only northern variety of any\r\nimportance supposed to have Bourquiniana blood is the Delaware, and in\r\nthis variety only a fraction of Bourquiniana blood is presumably\r\npresent. Bourquiniana can be propagated from cuttings more easily than\r\nthe typical Æstivalis but not so readily as Labrusca, Vulpina or\r\nVinifera. Many of the varieties of Bourquiniana show a marked\r\nsusceptibility to mildew and black-rot; in fact, the whole Herbemont\r\ngroup is much inferior in this respect to the Norton group of\r\nÆstivalis. The roots are somewhat hard, branch rather freely and are\r\nquite resistant to phylloxera.\r\n\r\n8. _Vitis bicolor_, Le Conte. Blue Grape. Northern Summer Grape.\r\nNorthern Æstivalis.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, climbing; shoots cylindrical or angled, with long\r\n    internodes, generally glabrous, usually showing much blue bloom,\r\n    sometimes spiny at base; diaphragms thick; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    long, usually bifid. Leaves with short, broad stipules; leaf-blade\r\n    large; roundish-cordate, usually three-, sometimes on older growth\r\n    shallowly five-lobed, rarely entire; petiolar sinus variable in\r\n    depth, usually narrow; margin irregularly dentate; teeth\r\n    acuminate; glabrous above, usually glabrous below and showing much\r\n    blue bloom which sometimes disappears late in the season; young\r\n    leaves sometimes pubescent; petioles very long. Cluster of medium\r\n    size, compact, simple; peduncle long. Berries small, black with\r\n    much bloom, acid but pleasant tasting when ripe. Seeds small,\r\n    plump, broadly oval, very short beak; chalaza oval, raised,\r\n    distinct; raphe distinct, showing as a cord-like ridge.\r\n\r\nBicolor is readily distinguished from Æstivalis by the absence of the\r\nreddish pubescence and by blooming slightly later. The habitat of\r\nBicolor is to the north of that of Æstivalis, occupying the\r\nnortheastern, whereas Æstivalis occupies the southeastern quarter of\r\nthe United States. Like Æstivalis, this species is not confined to\r\nstreams and river banks but frequently grows on higher land also. It\r\nis found in north Missouri, Illinois, southwestern Wisconsin, Indiana,\r\nsouthern Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New York,\r\nsouthwestern Ontario, New Jersey and Maryland and by some botanists is\r\nreported as far south as western North Carolina and west Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe horticultural characters of Bicolor are much the same as those of\r\nÆstivalis. About the only points of difference are that it is much\r\nhardier (some of the Wisconsin vines stand a temperature as low as 20\r\ndegrees below zero); it is said to be slightly less resistant to\r\nmildew and more resistant to phylloxera. Like Æstivalis, Bicolor does\r\nnot thrive on limy soils and it is difficult to propagate from\r\ncuttings. The horticultural possibilities of Bicolor are probably much\r\nthe same as those of Æstivalis, although many think it to be more\r\npromising for the North. It is as yet cultivated but little. Its chief\r\ndefect for domestication is the small size of the fruit.\r\n\r\n9. _Vitis candicans_, Englem. Mustang Grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, climbing; shoots and petioles densely wooly,\r\n    whitish or rusty; diaphragm thick; tendrils intermittent. Leaves\r\n    with large stipules; blade small, broadly cordate to\r\n    reniform-ovate, entire or in young shoots and on young vines and\r\n    sprouts usually deeply three- to five-, or even seven-lobed; teeth\r\n    shallow, sinuate; petiolar sinus shallow, wide, sometimes lacking;\r\n    dull, slightly rugose above, dense whitish pubescence below.\r\n    Clusters small. Berries medium to large, black, purple, green, or\r\n    even whitish, thin blue bloom or bloomless. Seeds usually three or\r\n    four, large, short, plump, blunt, notched; chalaza oval,\r\n    depressed, indistinct; raphe a broad groove.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of this grape extends from southern Oklahoma, as a\r\nnorthern limit, southwesterly into Mexico. The western boundary is the\r\nPecos River. It is found on dry, alluvial, sandy or limestone bottoms\r\nor on limestone bluff lands and is said to be especially abundant\r\nalong upland ravines. Candicans grows well on limestone lands,\r\nenduring as much as 60 per cent of carbonate of lime in the soil. The\r\nspecies blooms shortly before Labrusca and a week later than Vulpina.\r\nIt requires the long hot summers of its native country and will stand\r\nextreme drouth but is not hardy to cold, 10 or 15 degrees below zero\r\nkilling the vine outright unless protected; and a lesser degree of\r\ncold injuring it severely. The berries, which are large for wild\r\nvines, have thin skins under which there is a pigment which gives\r\nthem, when first ripe, a fiery, pungent taste but which partly\r\ndisappears with maturity. The berries are very persistent, clinging to\r\nthe pedicel long after ripe. Candicans is difficult to propagate from\r\ncuttings. Its roots resist phylloxera fairly well. It makes a good\r\nstock for Vinifera vines in its native country, but owing to the\r\ndifficulty of propagation is seldom used for that purpose. In the\r\nearly days of Texas, it was much used for the making of wine but as it\r\nis deficient in sugar, and as the must retains the acrid, pungent\r\nflavor, it does not seem to be well adapted for this purpose. It is\r\nnot regarded as having great promise for southern horticulture and\r\ncertainly has none for the North.\r\n\r\n10. _Vitis Labrusca_, Linn. Fox-Grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, stocky, climbing; shoots cylindrical, densely\r\n    pubescent; diaphragms medium to thick; tendrils continuous,\r\n    strong, bifid or trifid. Leaves with long, cordate stipules;\r\n    leaf-blade large, thick, broadly cordate or round; entire or\r\n    three-lobed, frequently notched; sinuses rounded; petiolar sinus\r\n    variable in depth and width, V-shaped; margin with shallow,\r\n    acute-pointed, scalloped teeth; upper surface rugose, dark green,\r\n    on young leaves pubescent, becoming glabrous when mature; lower\r\n    surface covered with dense pubescence, more or less whitish on\r\n    young leaves, becoming dun-colored when mature. Clusters more or\r\n    less compound, usually shouldered, compact; pedicels thick;\r\n    peduncle short. Berries round; skin thick, covered with bloom,\r\n    with strong musky or foxy aroma. Seeds two to four, large,\r\n    distinctly notched, beak short; chalaza oval in shape, indistinct,\r\n    showing as a depression; raphe, a groove.\r\n\r\nLabrusca is indigenous to the eastern part of North America, including\r\nthe region between the Atlantic Ocean and the Alleghany Mountains. It\r\nis sometimes found in the valleys and along the western slopes of the\r\nAlleghanies. Many botanists say it never occurs in the Mississippi\r\nValley. In the first-named area it ranges from Maine to Georgia. It\r\nhas the most restricted habitat of any American species of\r\nhorticultural importance, being much exceeded in extent of territory\r\nby _V. rotundifolia_, _V. æstivalis_ and _V. vulpina_.\r\n\r\nLabrusca has furnished more cultivated varieties, either pure-breeds\r\nor hybrids, than all other American species together. The reason for\r\nthis is partly, no doubt, that it is native to the portion of the\r\nUnited States first settled and is the most common grape in the region\r\nwhere agriculture first advanced to the condition at which fruits were\r\ndesired. This does not wholly account for its prominence, however,\r\nwhich must be sought elsewhere. In its wild state, Labrusca is\r\nprobably the most attractive to the eye of any of our American grapes\r\non account of the size of its fruit, and this undoubtedly turned the\r\nattention of those who were early interested in the possibilities of\r\nAmerican grape-growing to this species rather than to any other.\r\n\r\nThe southern Labrusca is quite different from the northern form and\r\ndemands different conditions for its successful growth; in the North,\r\nat least two types of the species may be distinguished. Vines are\r\nfound in the woods of New England which resemble Concord very closely\r\nin both vine and fruit, excepting that the grapes are much smaller in\r\nsize and more seedy. There is also the large-fruited, foxy Labrusca,\r\nusually with reddish berries, represented by such cultivated varieties\r\nas Northern Muscadine, Dracut Amber, Lutie and others. Labrusca is\r\npeculiar amongst American grapes in showing black-, white- and\r\nred-fruited forms of wild vines growing in the woods. Because of this\r\nvariability, it is impossible to give the exact climatic and soil\r\nconditions best adapted to the species. It is reasonable to suppose,\r\nhowever, that the ideal conditions for this species under cultivation\r\nare not widely different from those prevailing where the species is\r\nindigenous. In the case of Labrusca, this means that it is best\r\nadapted to humid climates, and that the temperature desired varies\r\naccording to whether the variety comes from the southern or northern\r\nform of the species.\r\n\r\nThe root system of Labrusca does not penetrate the soil deeply, but\r\nthe vine is said to succeed better in deep and clayey soils than\r\nÆstivalis. It endures an excess of water in the soil, and, on the\r\nother hand, requires less water for successful growing than Æstivalis\r\nor Vulpina. In spite of its ability to withstand clayey soils, it\r\nseems to prefer loose, warm, well-drained sandy lands to all others.\r\nThe French growers report that all varieties of this species show a\r\nmarked antipathy to a limestone soil, the vines soon becoming affected\r\nwith chlorosis when planted in soils of this nature. In corroboration\r\nof this, it may be said that Labrusca is not often found wild in\r\nlimestone soils. The Labruscas succeed very well in the North and\r\nfairly well in the Middle West as far south as Arkansas, where they\r\nare raised on account of their fruit qualities, for here the vines are\r\nnot nearly so vigorous and healthy as are those of other species. In\r\nAlabama, they are reported to be generally unsatisfactory, and in\r\nTexas the vines are short-lived, unhealthy, and generally\r\nunsatisfactory, particularly in the dry regions. There are some\r\nexceptions to this, as for instance, in the Piedmont region of the\r\nCarolinas, where, owing to elevation or other causes, the climate of a\r\nsouthern region is semi-northern in its character.\r\n\r\nThe grapes of Labrusca are large and usually handsomely colored. The\r\nskin is thick, covering a layer of adhering flesh, which gives the\r\nimpression of its being thicker than it actually is; the berry is\r\nvariable in tenderness, sometimes tough, but in many cultivated\r\nvarieties is so tender that it cracks in transportation. The skin of\r\nthis species usually has a peculiar aroma, generally spoken of as\r\nfoxy, and a slightly acid, astringent taste. Beneath the skin there is\r\na layer of juicy pulp, quite sweet and never showing much acidity in\r\nripe fruit. The center of the berry is occupied by rather dense pulp,\r\nmore or less stringy, with considerable acid close to the seeds. Many\r\nobject to the foxy aroma of this species, but, nevertheless, the most\r\npopular American varieties are more or less foxy. Analyses show that\r\nthe fruit is usually characterized by a low percentage of sugar and\r\nacid, the very sweet-tasting fox-grapes not showing as high a\r\nsugar-content as some of the disagreeably tart Æstivalis and Vulpina\r\nsorts. This, in addition to the foxiness which furnishes an excess of\r\naroma in the wine, has prevented Labrusca varieties from becoming\r\nfavorites with the wine-makers, but most of the grape-juice now\r\nmanufactured is made from them.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the characters enumerated, it may be said that Labrusca\r\nsubmits well to vineyard culture, is fairly vigorous and generally\r\nquite productive. It grows readily from cuttings and in hardiness is\r\nintermediate between Vulpina, the hardiest of our American species,\r\nand Æstivalis. The roots are soft and fleshy (for an American grape)\r\nand in some localities subject to attacks of phylloxera. None of the\r\nvarieties of Labrusca has ever been popular in France on this account.\r\nIn the wild vines, the fruit is inclined to drop when ripe. This\r\ndefect is known as \"shattering\" or \"shelling\" among grape-growers and\r\nis a serious weakness in some varieties. Labrusca is said to be more\r\nsensitive in its wild state to mildew and black-rot than any other\r\nAmerican species, but the evidence on this point does not seem to be\r\nwholly conclusive. In the South, and in some parts of the Middle West,\r\nthe leaves of all varieties of Labrusca sunburn and shrivel in the\r\nlatter part of the summer. The vines do not endure drouth as well as\r\nÆstivalis or Vulpina and not nearly so well as Rupestris.\r\n\r\n11. _Vitis vinifera_, Linn.\r\n\r\n    Vine variable in vigor, not so high climbing as most American\r\n    species; tendrils intermittent. Leaves round-cordate, thin,\r\n    smooth, and when young, shining, frequently more or less deeply\r\n    three-, five-, or even seven-lobed; usually glabrous but in some\r\n    varieties the leaves and young shoots are hairy and even downy\r\n    when young; lobes rounded or pointed; teeth variable; petiolar\r\n    sinus deep, narrow, usually overlapping. Berries very variable in\r\n    size and color, usually oval though globular. Seeds variable in\r\n    size and shape, usually notched at upper end and characterized\r\n    always by a bottle-necked, elongated beak; chalaza broad, usually\r\n    rough, distinct; raphe indistinct. Roots large, soft and spongy.\r\n\r\nThe original habitat of the species is not positively known. De\r\nCandolle, as noted in the first part of this work, considered the\r\nregion about the Caspian Sea as the probable habitat of the Old World\r\ngrape. There is but little doubt that the original home of _V.\r\nvinifera_ is some place in western Asia.\r\n\r\nNeither American nor European writers agree as to the climate desired\r\nby Vinifera, for the reason, probably that all of the varieties in\r\nthis variable species do not require the same climatic conditions.\r\nThere are certain phases of climate, however, that are well agreed on:\r\nthe species requires a warm, dry climate and is more sensitive to\r\nchange of temperature than American species. Varieties of this species\r\ncan be grown successfully in a wide variety of soils, being much less\r\nparticular as to soils than American sorts.\r\n\r\nCertain characters of the fruit of this species are not found in any\r\nAmerican forms: First, the skin, which is attached very closely to the\r\nflesh and which is never astringent or acid, can be eaten with the\r\nfruit; second, the flesh is firm, yet tender, and uniform throughout,\r\ndiffering in this respect from all American grapes which have a sweet,\r\nwatery and tender pulp close to the skin with a tough and more or less\r\nacid core at the center; third, the flavor has a peculiarly sprightly\r\nquality known as vinous; fourth, the berry adheres firmly to the\r\npedicel, the fruit seldom \"shattering\" or \"shelling\" from the cluster.\r\n\r\nIn the various hybrids that have been made between American and\r\nVinifera varieties, it is usually found that the desirable qualities\r\nof Vinifera are inherited in about the same proportion as the\r\nundesirable ones. The fruit is improved in the hybrid but the vine is\r\nweakened; quality is usually purchased at the expense of hardiness and\r\ndisease-resisting power. Vinifera may be grown very readily from\r\ncuttings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIII.--Lutie (×1/2). Pocklington (×1/2).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF GRAPES\r\n\r\n\r\nNature has expended her bounties in fullest measure for the vineyard.\r\nMore than 2000 varieties of grapes are described in American\r\nviticultural literature, and twice as many more find mention in\r\nEuropean treatises on the vine. Few other fruits offer the novelties\r\ngiven the grape in flavors, aromas, sizes, colors and uses. The\r\nvineyard, then, to fulfill commercial potentialities, should supply\r\ngrapes throughout the whole season, and of the several colors and\r\nflavors and for all uses. A prime requisite for a vineyard being\r\nwell-selected varieties, an assortment of all kinds and for all places\r\nin America is here described.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTONI\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nActoni is a table-grape of the Malaga type which ripens at Geneva, New\r\nYork, late in October, too late for the average season in the East but\r\nworth trying in favorable locations. It is grown in California but is\r\nnot a favorite sort. The following brief description is made from\r\nfruit grown at Geneva:\r\n\r\n    Clusters large, shouldered, tapering, loose; berries medium to\r\n    very large, long-oval to oval, clear green yellow; flesh crisp,\r\n    firm; flavor sweet; quality good.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGAWAM\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Randall, Rogers No. 15_\r\n\r\nThe qualities commending Agawam are large size and attractive\r\nappearance of bunch and berry; rich, sweet aromatic flavor; vigor of\r\nvine; and capacity for self-fertilization. For a grape having its\r\nproportion of European parentage, the vine is vigorous, hardy and\r\nproductive. The chief defects in fruit are a thick and rough skin,\r\ncoarse, solid texture of pulp and foxy flavor. The vine is susceptible\r\nto the mildews and in many localities does not yield well. Although\r\nAgawam ripens soon after Concord, it can be kept much longer and even\r\nimproves in flavor after picking. The vines prefer heavy soils, doing\r\nbetter on clay than on sand or gravel. This is one of the grapes grown\r\nby E. S. Rogers, Salem, Massachusetts. It was introduced as No. 15 but\r\nin 1861 was given the name it now bears.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes thick, dark brown; nodes\r\n    enlarged, flattened; internodes short; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    bifid to trifid. Leaves thick; upper surface light green, dull,\r\n    smooth; lower surface pale green, pubescent, flocculent; lobes\r\n    lacking; terminus acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; lateral\r\n    sinus very shallow; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers on plan of six,\r\n    nearly self-fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps until midwinter. Clusters medium to large,\r\n    short, broad, tapering, loose; pedicel short; brush very short,\r\n    pale green. Berries large, oval, dark purplish-red with thin\r\n    bloom, very persistent; skin thick, tough, adherent, astringent;\r\n    flesh pale green, translucent, tough, stringy, solid, foxy; good.\r\n    Seeds adherent, two to five, large, long, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nALMERIA\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the varieties commonly found in eastern markets from\r\nAlmeria and Malaga, Spain, although occasionally it may come from\r\nCalifornia where the variety, or similar varieties confused with it,\r\nis now grown. This sort is remarkable for its wonderful keeping\r\nqualities; it is adapted only to hot interior regions. The Almeria\r\ncultivated by the California Experiment Station is described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"Vine vigorous; leaves of medium size, round and slightly or not\r\n    at all lobed, quite glabrous on both sides, teeth obtuse and\r\n    alternately large and small; bunches large, loose or compact,\r\n    irregular conical; berries from small to large, cylindrical,\r\n    flattened on the ends, very hard and tasteless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Rupestris)\r\n\r\nThe notable qualities of America are vigor of growth and health of\r\nfoliage in vine, and persistence of berries, which have strongly\r\ncolored red juice, high sugar-content and excellent flavor. The grapes\r\nwholly lack the foxy taste and aroma of Labrusca and the variety,\r\ntherefore, offers possibilities for breeding sorts lacking the foxy\r\nflavor of Concord and Niagara. America has great resistance to heat\r\nand cold. Also, it is said to be a suitable stock upon which to graft\r\nVinifera varieties to resist phylloxera. The vigor of the vine and the\r\nluxuriance of the foliage make it an excellent sort for arbors.\r\nAmerica was grown by T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, from seed of Jaeger\r\nNo. 43 pollinated by a male Rupestris. It was introduced about 1892.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous, dark\r\n    reddish-brown with heavy bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, long, bifid. Leaves small, thin; upper\r\n    surface glossy, smooth; lower surface light green, hairy; lobes\r\n    lacking or faint, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus deep and\r\n    wide; teeth of average depth and width. Flowers self-sterile,\r\n    usually on plan of six, open late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season or later, keeps well. Clusters large, long,\r\n    broad, tapering, irregular, single-shouldered, compact; pedicel\r\n    short, slender with small warts; brush short, thick with red\r\n    tinge. Berries small, variable in size, round, purplish-black,\r\n    glossy with purplish-red pigment, astringent; flesh dull white\r\n    with faint red tinge, translucent, tender, melting, spicy, vinous,\r\n    sweet; good. Seeds free, two to five, long, pointed,\r\n    yellowish-brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMINIA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nAminia is one of the best early grapes, its season being with or a\r\nlittle after Moore Early. The grapes are of high quality and\r\nattractive appearance, but the bunches are small, variable in size,\r\nnot well formed and the berries ripen unevenly. The vine is vigorous\r\nbut is neither as hardy nor as productive as a commercial variety\r\nshould be. In 1867 Isadora Bush, a Missourian, planted vines of Rogers\r\nNo. 39 from several different sources. When these came into bearing,\r\nhe distinguished three varieties. Bush selected the best of the three\r\nand, with the consent of Rogers, named it Aminia. In spite of Bush's\r\ncare, there are two distinct grapes cultivated under this name.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, precariously hardy, lacking in productiveness.\r\n    Canes rough, long, thick, dark brown; nodes enlarged; internodes\r\n    long; tendrils intermittent, long, trifid or bifid, persistent.\r\n    Leaves large; upper surface dull, smooth; lower surface light\r\n    green, pubescent; lobes three; terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, narrow, often closed and overlapping; basal sinus usually\r\n    lacking; lateral sinus shallow, narrow; teeth shallow, wide.\r\n    Flowers open in mid-season, self-sterile; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters small, broad, irregular,\r\n    conical, sometimes with a long shoulder, loose; pedicel long with\r\n    few warts; brush short, thick, brownish-red. Berries variable,\r\n    round, dull black with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin thick,\r\n    tender, adherent with purplish-red pigment, astringent; flesh\r\n    greenish, translucent, tender, solid, coarse, foxy; good. Seeds\r\n    adherent, one to six, very large.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST GIANT\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nAugust Giant is a hybrid between Labrusca and Vinifera in which the\r\nfruit characters are those of the latter species. In appearance and\r\ntaste of berry, the variety resembles Black Hamburg. The vine is\r\nusually vigorous and, considering its parentage, is very hardy. The\r\nfoliage is thick and luxuriant but subject to mildew. Vigor of vine,\r\nbeauty of foliage and the quality of the fruit make the variety\r\ndesirable for the amateur. It needs a long-maturing season. August\r\nGiant was grown by N. B. White, Norwood, Massachusetts, in 1861, from\r\nseed of an early, large-berried, red Labrusca pollinated by Black\r\nHamburg.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, subject to mildew. Canes long,\r\n    numerous, thick, dark brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils continuous, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves large,\r\n    thick; upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth; lower surface\r\n    pale green or bronzed, pubescent; lobes three, terminal one acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus deep, narrow, frequently closed and overlapping;\r\n    lateral sinus shallow or a notch; teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers\r\n    open in mid-season, self-sterile; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters of average size, short,\r\n    broad, irregularly tapering, single-shouldered, loose; pedicel\r\n    long, thick with large warts; brush short, thick, green or with\r\n    brown tinge. Berries large, oval, purplish-red or black, dull with\r\n    thick bloom, firm; skin tough, adherent, astringent; flesh green,\r\n    translucent, tough, stringy; good. Seeds adherent, one to four,\r\n    large, blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACCHUS\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nBacchus is an offspring of Clinton which it resembles in vine and leaf\r\ncharacters, but surpasses in quality of fruit and in productiveness of\r\nvine. The special points of merit of the variety are: resistance to\r\ncold, resistance to phylloxera, freedom from fungi and insects,\r\nproductiveness, ease of multiplication and capacity to bear grafts.\r\nIts limitations are: poor quality for table use, inability to\r\nwithstand dry soils or droughts, and nonadaptability to soils\r\ncontaining much lime. The variety originated with J. H. Ricketts,\r\nNewburgh, New York, and was first exhibited by him in 1879.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes numerous,\r\n    dark brown with bloom at the nodes which are enlarged and\r\n    flattened; tendrils bifid. Leaves small; upper surface dark green,\r\n    glossy, smooth; lower surface dull green, smooth; lobes three,\r\n    terminal one acuminate; petiolar sinus shallow, narrow, sometimes\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus shallow, wide.\r\n    Flowers open early, self-sterile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well, hangs long. Clusters small, slender,\r\n    uniform, cylindrical, single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    slender with a few small warts; brush short, wine-colored. Berries\r\n    small, round, black, glossy, covered with thin bloom, hang well to\r\n    pedicels, firm; skin thin, adherent, contains much wine-colored\r\n    pigment, slightly astringent; flesh dark green, translucent,\r\n    fine-grained, tough, vinous, spicy; fair quality. Seeds clinging,\r\n    one to four, many abortive, large, short and wide, plump, sharply\r\n    pointed, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKATOR\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThis is a Hungarian wine grape but its high quality and early season\r\nmake it a desirable table-grape in the East. It seems to be grown but\r\nlittle on the Pacific slope. The following description is made from\r\nfruit grown at Geneva, New York:\r\n\r\n    Vine medium in vigor, productive. Young leaves tinged red at\r\n    edges, upper surface glossy; mature leaves large, round, upper\r\n    surface dull, lower surface downy; lobes five, terminal lobe\r\n    acuminate; basal sinus deep, medium to narrow, closed to\r\n    overlapping; lower lateral sinus deep, variable in width; upper\r\n    lateral sinus deep, usually narrows; margins dentate, teeth\r\n    shallow to medium deep. Flowers appear late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens at Geneva the first or second week in October and\r\n    keeps well in storage; clusters above medium in size, medium in\r\n    length, broad, frequently double-shouldered, tapering, medium to\r\n    loose; berries medium to small, oval, light red becoming dark when\r\n    fully ripe, with thick bloom; skin thin, tender, adherent to the\r\n    pulp; flesh greenish, juicy, tender, melting, vinous, sweet;\r\n    quality very good.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARRY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nBarry (Plate VII) is one of the best American black grapes, resembling\r\nin berry and in flavor and keeping quality of fruit its European\r\nparent, Black Hamburg. The appearance of berry and bunch is\r\nattractive. The vine is vigorous, hardy and productive but susceptible\r\nto mildew. The ripening season is just after that of Concord. For the\r\ntable, for winter keeping and for the amateur, this variety may be\r\nhighly recommended. Barry was dedicated in 1869, by E. S. Rogers, who\r\noriginated it, to Patrick Barry, distinguished nurseryman and\r\npomologist. The variety is grown in gardens throughout the grape\r\nregions of eastern America.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive, susceptible to mildew. Canes\r\n    long, numerous, thick, dark brown with heavy bloom; nodes\r\n    flattened; shoots glabrous; tendrils intermittent, bifid or\r\n    trifid. Leaves large; upper surface light green, glossy, smooth;\r\n    lower surface pale green, pubescent; lobes one to three, terminus\r\n    acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, sometimes closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow,\r\n    narrow; teeth shallow. Flowers open in mid-season, self-sterile;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters short, very broad,\r\n    tapering, often subdividing into several parts, compact; pedicel\r\n    with small warts. Berries large, oval, dark purplish-black,\r\n    glossy, covered with heavy bloom, adherent; skin thin, tough,\r\n    adherent; flesh pale green, translucent, tender, stringy, vinous,\r\n    pleasant-flavored; good. Seeds adherent, one to five, large,\r\n    deeply notched, with enlarged neck, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEACON\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nAnother of T. V. Munson's hybrids is Beacon. It is not well adapted to\r\nnorthern regions but does very well in the South. The vine is vigorous\r\nand bears a handsome, compact mass of foliage which retains its color\r\nand freshness through drouths and heat. Munson grew Beacon in 1887\r\nfrom seed of Big Berry (a variety of Lincecumii) pollinated by\r\nConcord, the vine bearing first in 1889.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, precariously hardy, productive. Canes short,\r\n    slender, light brown. Leaves healthy, thick, dark green, sometimes\r\n    rugose; veins showing indistinctly through the slight pubescence\r\n    of the lower surface. Flowers open in mid-season, on plan of five\r\n    or six, self-fertile.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, long, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, usually high-shouldered, compact. Berries variable in\r\n    size, round, purplish-black, dull with heavy bloom, firm; skin\r\n    tough, adherent with a large amount of purplish-red pigment,\r\n    astringent; flesh tender, aromatic, spicy, vinous, mildly subacid;\r\n    good. Seeds free, large, broad, blunt, notched.\r\n\r\n\r\nBERCKMANS\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\nIn Berckmans we have the fruit of Delaware on the vine of Clinton. The\r\nberry and bunch resemble Delaware in shape; the fruit is of the same\r\ncolor; bunch and berry are larger; the grapes keep longer; the flesh\r\nis firmer but the quality is not so good, the flesh lacking tenderness\r\nand richness in comparison with Delaware. The vine of Berckmans is not\r\nonly more vigorous, but is less subject to mildew than that of\r\nDelaware. The vine characters are not, however, as good as those of\r\nClinton. The variety is poorly adapted to some soils, and on these the\r\ngrapes do not color well. In spite of many good qualities, Berckmans\r\nis but an amateur's grape. The name commemorates the viticultural\r\nlabors of P. J. Berckmans, a contemporary and friend of A. P. Wylie,\r\nof Chester, South Carolina, who originated the variety. Berckmans came\r\nfrom Delaware seed fertilized by Clinton, the seed having been sown in\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous, slender,\r\n    dark brown; nodes prominent, flattened; internodes short; shoots\r\n    glabrous; tendrils intermittent, long, bifid. Leaves small, thin;\r\n    upper surface light green, smooth; lower surface pale green,\r\n    glabrous; lobes one to three, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    shallow, wide; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow.\r\n    Flowers open early, self-fertile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens with Delaware. Clusters shouldered, compact, slender;\r\n    pedicel long, slender with few warts; brush short, light green.\r\n    Berries small, oval, Delaware-red, darker when well ripened,\r\n    covered with thin bloom, persistent; skin thin, tough, adherent,\r\n    astringent; flesh pale yellowish-green, translucent, fine-grained,\r\n    tender, melting, vinous, sweet, sprightly; very good. Seeds free,\r\n    one to four, small, broad, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK EAGLE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Black Eagle is of the best, but the vine lacks in vigor,\r\nhardiness and productiveness and is self-sterile. Bunch and berry are\r\nlarge and attractive. The season is about with Concord. Black Eagle\r\nhas wholly failed as a commercial variety, and its several weaknesses\r\nprevent amateurs from growing it widely. The variety originated with\r\nStephen W. Underhill, Croton-on-Hudson, New York, from seed of Concord\r\npollinated by Black Prince. It fruited first in 1866.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, precariously hardy, unproductive. Canes rough,\r\n    thick, reddish-brown with light bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened\r\n    internodes long; tendrils continuous, long, bifid or trifid.\r\n    Leaves thick; upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth to rugose;\r\n    lobes five; terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus deep; lateral\r\n    sinus wide, narrowing towards top, deep. Flowers open in\r\n    mid-season, self-sterile; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, long, tapering,\r\n    single-or double-shouldered, compact; pedicel long, slender with\r\n    few warts; brush short, pale green. Berries variable in size,\r\n    oval, black, glossy with thick bloom; skin tender, thin, adherent\r\n    with wine-colored pigment; flesh pale green, translucent, tender,\r\n    vinous; good. Seeds free, one to four, large.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK HAMBURG\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nBlack Hamburg (Plate VI) is an old European sort, long the mainstay in\r\nforcing-houses in Belgium, England and America and now popular out of\r\ndoors in California. It is an excellent table-grape but, while it\r\nkeeps well, its tender skin does not permit its being shipped far,\r\nespecially when grown out of doors. The vine is subject to disease.\r\nThe following description of the fruit is made from grapes grown in\r\nthe greenhouse:\r\n\r\n    Bunches very large, often a foot in length and weighing several\r\n    pounds; very broad at the shoulder and gradually tapering to a\r\n    point; compact, oftentimes too compact; berries very large, round\r\n    or slightly round-oval; skin rather thick; dark purple becoming\r\n    black at full maturity; flesh firm, juicy, sweet and rich; quality\r\n    very good or best. Season early in the forcing-house but rather\r\n    late out of doors.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK MALVOISE\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThis variety is rather widely grown in California as an early\r\ntable-grape and might be worth trying in eastern grape regions. While\r\nthe fruit is not of the best quality, it is good. The following\r\ndescription is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy and productive; wood long-jointed, rather\r\n    slender, light brown. Leaves of medium size, oval, evenly and\r\n    deeply five-lobed; basal sinus open, with nearly parallel sides;\r\n    upper surface smooth, almost glabrous; lower surface slightly\r\n    tomentose on the veins and veinlets. Bunches large, loose,\r\n    branching; berries large, oblong, reddish black with faint bloom;\r\n    flesh firm, juicy, crisp; flavor lacking in richness and\r\n    character; quality not high. Season early, keeping and shipping\r\n    but poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK MOROCCO\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nBlack Morocco very generally meets the approval of grape-growers on\r\nthe Pacific slope without being a prime favorite for either home use\r\nor commerce. The grapes are not high enough in quality for a home\r\nvineyard, and, while they ship well, are hard to handle because of the\r\nlarge size and rigidity of the bunches. Another fault is that the\r\nvines are subject to root-knot. The chief asset of the variety is\r\nhandsome appearance of fruit. This variety is remarkable for the\r\nnumber of second-crop bunches which it produces on the laterals. The\r\nfollowing description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, productive; canes spreading, few. Leaves\r\n    medium to small, very deeply five-lobed; the younger leaves\r\n    truncate at base, giving them a semi-circular outline, with long,\r\n    sharp teeth alternating with very small ones; glabrous, or nearly\r\n    so, on both sides. Bunches very large, short, shouldered, compact\r\n    and rigid; berries very large, round, often misshapen from\r\n    compression; dull purple, lacking color in the center of the\r\n    bunch; flesh firm, crisp, neutral in flavor, lacking in richness;\r\n    quality rather low. Season late, keeping and shipping well.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIGHTON\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nBrighton (Plate VIII) is one of the few Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids\r\nwhich have attained prominence in commercial vineyards. It ranks as\r\none of the leading amateur grapes in eastern America and is among the\r\nten or twelve chief commercial sorts of this region. Its good points\r\nare: for the fruit, high quality; for the vine, vigorous growth,\r\nproductiveness, adaptability to various soils and ability to withstand\r\nfungi. Brighton has two serious defects which keep it from taking\r\nhigher rank as a commercial variety: it deteriorates in quality very\r\nquickly after maturity, so that it cannot be kept for more than a few\r\ndays at its best, hence cannot well be shipped to distant markets; and\r\nit is self-sterile to a more marked degree than any other\r\ncommonly-grown grape. Brighton is a seedling of Diana Hamburg\r\npollinated by Concord, raised by Jacob Moore, Brighton, New York. The\r\noriginal vine fruited first in 1870.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive, subject to mildew. Canes long,\r\n    numerous, light brown; nodes enlarged, usually flattened;\r\n    internodes long; tendrils continuous, long, bifid. Leaves large,\r\n    thick; upper surface dark green, dull, smooth; lower surface pale\r\n    green, pubescent; lobes three when present, terminal one acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus intermediate in depth and width; lateral sinus\r\n    shallow; teeth narrow. Flowers open late, self-sterile; stamens\r\n    reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season. Clusters large, long, broad, tapering, heavily\r\n    shouldered, loose; pedicel thick; brush pale green with brown\r\n    tinge, thick, short. Berries irregular, large, oval, light red,\r\n    glossy with heavy bloom, persistent, soft; skin thick, tender,\r\n    adherent, astringent; flesh green, transparent, tender, stringy,\r\n    melting, aromatic, vinous, sweet; very good. Seeds free, one to\r\n    five, broad, light brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIV.--Moore Early (×3/5).]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRILLIANT\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\nBrilliant is a cross between Lindley and Delaware. In cluster and size\r\nof berry it resembles Lindley; in color and quality of fruit it is\r\nabout the same as Delaware, differing chiefly in having more\r\nastringency in the skin. Its season is about with Delaware. The grapes\r\ndo not crack or shell, therefore ship well, and have very good keeping\r\nqualities, especially on the vine where they often hang for weeks. The\r\nvine is vigorous and hardy. The defects which have kept Brilliant from\r\nbecoming one of the standard commercial sorts are: marked\r\nsusceptibility to fungi, variability in size of cluster, unevenness in\r\nripening and unproductiveness. In favorable situations this variety\r\npleases the amateur, and the commercial grower often finds it\r\nprofitable. The seed which produced Brilliant was planted by T. V.\r\nMunson, Denison, Texas, in 1883 and the variety was introduced in\r\n1887.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, rather unproductive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    thick, dark brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, long, bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface gray-green, downy;\r\n    obscurely three-lobed with terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, narrow; basal and lateral sinuses obscure and shallow when\r\n    present; teeth intermediate in depth and width. Flowers open late,\r\n    self-fertile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season, keeps well. Clusters medium, blunt,\r\n    cylindrical, usually shouldered, compact; pedicel short, thick\r\n    with a few small warts; brush short, thick, pale green with\r\n    reddish tinge. Berries round, dark red, glossy with thin bloom,\r\n    strongly adherent, firm; skin thin, tough, adherent; flesh pale\r\n    green, transparent, juicy, stringy, fine-grained, vinous, sweet;\r\n    good. Seeds clinging, one to four, large, broad, elongated, plump,\r\n    light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROWN\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nIn spite of many encomiums in the past quarter century, Brown has not\r\nreceived favorable recognition from fruit-growers. The quality is not\r\nhigh, the berries shatter badly, and the vine is lacking in vigor.\r\nBrown is a seedling of Isabella which came up in a yard at Newburgh,\r\nNew York, about 1884.\r\n\r\n    Vine hardy, productive. Canes short, slender, dark brown; tendrils\r\n    continuous. Leaves healthy, light green, glossy; veins well\r\n    defined, distinctly showing through the thick bronze of the lower\r\n    surface. Flowers open early, self-fertile stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit large, keeps well. Clusters small to medium, slender,\r\n    cylindrical or tapering, usually single-shouldered. Berries\r\n    intermediate in size, oval, black with thick bloom, drop soon\r\n    after ripening; skin adherent; flesh juicy, tough, fine-grained, a\r\n    little foxy, mild next the skin but tart at center; good. Seeds\r\n    short, blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPBELL EARLY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe meritorious qualities of Campbell Early (Plate IX) are: The grapes\r\nare high in quality when mature; free from foxiness and from acidity\r\nabout the seeds; have small seeds which easily part from the flesh;\r\nare early, ripening nearly a fortnight before Concord; bunch and berry\r\nare large and handsome; and the vines are exceptionally hardy.\r\nCampbell Early falls short in not being adapted to many soils; the\r\nvariety lacks productiveness; the grapes attain full color before they\r\nare ripe and are, therefore, often marketed in an unripe condition;\r\nthe bunch is variable in size; and the color of the berry is not\r\nattractive. George W. Campbell, Delaware, Ohio, grew this variety\r\nfrom a seedling of Moore Early pollinated by a Labrusca-Vinifera\r\nhybrid. It bore first in 1892.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes thick, dark reddish-brown,\r\n    surface roughened with small warts; nodes flattened; internodes\r\n    short; shoots pubescent; tendrils intermittent, short, bifid or\r\n    trifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface green, glossy; lower\r\n    surface bronze, heavily pubescent; lobes three, usually entire,\r\n    terminal one acute; petiolar sinus shallow, wide; basal sinus\r\n    pubescent; lateral sinus wide or a notch; teeth shallow, narrow.\r\n    Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps and ships well. Clusters usually large, long,\r\n    broad, tapering, single-shouldered; pedicel short, slender with\r\n    small warts; brush long, light wine color. Berries usually large,\r\n    round, oval, dark purplish-black, dull with heavy bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin tough, thin, adherent with dark red\r\n    pigment, astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy, coarse,\r\n    vinous, sweet from skin to center; good. Seeds free, one to four,\r\n    light brown, often with yellow tips.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nCanada is considered the most desirable hybrid between Vulpina and\r\nVinifera. The variety shows Vinifera more than Vulpina parentage;\r\nthus, in susceptibility to fungal diseases, in shape, color and\r\ntexture of foliage, in the flavor of the fruit and in the seeds, there\r\nare marked indications of Vinifera; while the vine, especially in the\r\nslenderness of its shoots and in the bunch and berry, shows Vulpina.\r\nCanada has little value as a dessert fruit but makes a very good red\r\nwine or grape-juice. Canada is a seedling of Clinton, a\r\nLabrusca-Vulpina hybrid, fertilized by Black St. Peters, a variety of\r\nVinifera. Charles Arnold, Paris, Ontario, planted the seed which\r\nproduced Canada in 1860.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    slender, ash-gray, reddish-brown at nodes with heavy bloom; nodes\r\n    enlarged; internodes short; tendrils intermittent, short, trifid\r\n    or bifid. Leaves thin; upper surface light green, smooth; lower\r\n    surface pale green, hairy; terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, narrow; basal sinus variable in depth and width; lateral\r\n    sinus deep and narrow; teeth deep and wide. Flowers self-sterile,\r\n    early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters long, slender, uniform,\r\n    cylindrical, compact; pedicel long, slender, smooth; brush short,\r\n    light brown. Berries small, round, purplish-black, glossy with\r\n    heavy bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin, tough, adherent; flesh\r\n    dark green, very juicy, fine-grained, tender, spicy, pleasant\r\n    vinous flavor, agreeably tart; good. Seeds free, one to three,\r\n    blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANANDAIGUA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nCanandaigua is worth attention because of the exceptionally good\r\nkeeping qualities of the grapes. The flavor is very good at picking\r\ntime but seems, if anything, to improve in storage. The vine\r\ncharacters are those of Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids, and in these the\r\nvariety is the equal of the average cultivated hybrid of these two\r\nspecies. The characters of the fruit, also, show plainly an admixture\r\nof Vinifera and Labrusca so combined as to make the grapes very\r\nsimilar to the best of such hybrids. Canandaigua is a chance seedling\r\nfound by E. L. Van Wormer, Canandaigua, New York, growing among wild\r\ngrapes. It was distributed about 1897.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, productive. Canes long, few,\r\n    reddish-brown, faint bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils\r\n    semi-continuous, bifid, dehisce early. Leaves large, thin; upper\r\n    surface light green; lower surface gray-green. Flowers sterile or\r\n    sometimes partly self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season, keeps unusually well. Clusters variable in\r\n    size, usually heavily single-shouldered, loose to medium. Berries\r\n    large, oval, black, covered with thick bloom, persistent; skin\r\n    adherent, thin, tough; flesh firm, sweet and rich; good, improves\r\n    as season advances. Seeds long with enlarged neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARMAN\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Vinifera, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nCarman is a grape having the characters of three species and hence is\r\nof interest to grape improvers. It has not become popular with\r\ngrowers, chiefly because the grapes ripen very late and are not of\r\nhigh quality. The most valuable character of the variety is that of\r\nlong keeping, whether hanging on the vine or after harvesting. T. V.\r\nMunson, Denison, Texas, raised Carman from seed of a wild post-oak\r\ngrape taken from the woods, pollinated with mixed pollen of Triumph\r\nand Herbemont. It was introduced in 1892.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, rather productive. Canes long,\r\n    numerous, thick, reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes long; tendrils intermittent, long, trifid. Leaves\r\n    large, thick; upper surface light green, glossy, older leaves\r\n    rugose; lower surface pale green, pubescent; terminal lobe acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus deep; basal sinus absent or shallow; lateral sinus\r\n    shallow when present. Flowers self-fertile or nearly so, open very\r\n    late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters variable in size, tapering,\r\n    single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, slender, smooth; brush\r\n    short, slender, wine-colored. Berries small, round, slightly\r\n    oblate, purplish-black, glossy, covered with heavy bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin thin, tough, free; flesh yellowish-green,\r\n    tender, post-oak flavor, vinous, spicy; good to very good. Seeds\r\n    free, one to four, small, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATAWBA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Arkansas, Catawba Tokay, Cherokee, Fancher, Keller's White, Lebanon,\r\nLincoln, Mammoth Catawba, Mead's Seedling, Merceron, Michigan, Muncy,\r\nOmega, Rose of Tennessee, Saratoga, Singleton, Tekomah, Tokay,\r\nVirginia Amber._\r\n\r\nCatawba has long been the standard red grape in the markets of eastern\r\nAmerica, chiefly because the fruit keeps well and is of high quality.\r\nThe vine is vigorous, hardy and productive, but the foliage and fruit\r\nare susceptible to fungi. These two faults account for the decline of\r\nCatawba in grape regions in the United States and for its growing\r\nunpopularity. In botanical characters and in adaptations and\r\nsusceptibilities, the variety suggests Vinifera crossed with Labrusca.\r\nThe characters of Catawba seem readily transmissible to its offspring\r\nand, besides having a number of pure-bred descendants which more or\r\nless resemble it, it is a parent of a still greater number of\r\ncross-breeds. As with Catawba, most of its progeny show Vinifera\r\ncharacters, as intermittent tendrils, Vinifera color of foliage, a\r\nvinous flavor wholly or nearly free from foxiness, and the\r\nsusceptibilities of Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids to certain diseases and\r\ninsects. Catawba was introduced by John Adlum, District of Columbia,\r\nabout 1823. Adlum secured cuttings from a Mrs. Scholl, Clarksburgh,\r\nMontgomery County, Maryland, in the spring of 1819. Its further\r\nhistory is not known.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes numerous, thick, dark\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged; tendrils continuous, bifid or trifid.\r\n    Leaves large; upper surface light green, dull, smooth; lower\r\n    surface grayish-white, heavily pubescent; lobes sometimes three,\r\n    terminal one acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; basal sinus often\r\n    lacking; lateral sinus narrow; teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers\r\n    self-fertile, open late, stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters large, long, broad, tapering,\r\n    single-or sometimes double-shouldered, loose; pedicel with a few\r\n    inconspicuous warts; brush short, pale green. Berries of medium\r\n    size, oval, dull purplish-red with thick bloom, firm; skin thick,\r\n    adherent, astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, vinous, sprightly, sweet and rich; very good. Seeds\r\n    free, frequently abortive, two, broad-necked, distinctly notched,\r\n    blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAMPION\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Beaconsfield, Early Champion, Talman's Seedling_\r\n\r\nChampion is a favorite early grape with some growers, although the\r\npoor quality of the fruit should have driven it from cultivation long\r\nago. The characters which have kept it in the market are earliness,\r\ngood shipping qualities, attractive appearance of fruit, and a\r\nvigorous, productive, hardy vine. The hardiness of the vine and the\r\nshort season of fruit development make it a good variety for northern\r\nclimates. This grape is best in appearance of fruit, in quality and in\r\nthe quantity produced, on light sandy soils. The origin of Champion is\r\nunknown. It was first grown about 1870 in New York.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy and productive. Canes of average size,\r\n    dark brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short; shoots\r\n    pubescent; tendrils continuous, long, bifid. Leaves large; upper\r\n    surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface dull gray, downy;\r\n    lobes usually three, often obscurely five, terminal one acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus deep; teeth shallow. Flowers self-fertile, early;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, three weeks before Concord, season short. Clusters\r\n    medium in size, blunt, cylindrical, usually not shouldered,\r\n    compact; pedicel short with inconspicuous warts; brush white\r\n    tinged with bronze. Berries medium in size, round, dull black\r\n    covered with heavy bloom, soft; skin thick, tender, adherent,\r\n    astringent; flesh light green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained,\r\n    tender, foxy; poor in quality. Seeds adherent, one to five, broad,\r\n    long, blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHASSELAS GOLDEN\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Chasselas Dore, Fontainebleau, Sweetwater_\r\n\r\nSeveral qualities have made Chasselas Golden a favorite grape wherever\r\nit can be grown. The variety is adapted to widely differing\r\nenvironments; the season of ripening is early; while not choicely\r\nhigh, the quality of the grapes is good and they are beautiful, clear\r\ngreen tinged with beautiful golden bronze where exposed to the sun.\r\nChasselas Golden is a popular variety on the Pacific slope and should\r\nbe one of the first Viniferas to be tried in the East. The following\r\ndescription was made from fruit grown at Geneva, New York:\r\n\r\n    Vine medium in vigor, very productive; buds open in mid-season.\r\n    Young leaves tinged with red on both upper and lower surfaces,\r\n    thinly pubescent to glabrous; mature leaves medium to above in\r\n    size, slightly cordate; upper surface glabrous, lower surface\r\n    slightly pubescent along the veins; lobes five in number, terminal\r\n    lobe acuminate; basal sinus broad and rather deep; lower lateral\r\n    sinus variable, usually broad and sometimes deep; upper lateral\r\n    sinus broad and frequently deep; teeth large, obtuse to rounded.\r\n    Flowers late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens early and keeps well in storage; clusters large,\r\n    long, broad, tapering, sometimes with a single shoulder,\r\n    compactness medium; berries medium to above, slightly oval, pale\r\n    green to clear yellow, with thin bloom; skin thin, tough,\r\n    adherent, slightly astringent; flesh greenish, translucent, firm,\r\n    juicy, tender, sweet; good.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHASSELAS ROSE\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nChasselas Rose is very similar to Chasselas Golden, differing chiefly\r\nin smaller bunch and berry and slightly different flavor which is\r\npossibly better. It is a standard sort in California and should be\r\nplanted in the East where the culture of Viniferas is attempted. The\r\ndescription is made from fruit grown at Geneva, New York:\r\n\r\n    Vine of medium vigor, productive. Opening leaves tinged with red\r\n    on both surfaces, mature leaves small, round; upper surface medium\r\n    green, somewhat dull, smooth; lower surface glabrous; lobes three;\r\n    basal sinus medium in depth and of variable width; lateral sinus\r\n    deep, narrow; teeth shallow, wide, dentate. Flowers appear late;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens the second week in October and is a good keeper\r\n    though it loses its flavor in storage; clusters above and below\r\n    medium, long, tapering to cylindrical, compact; berries medium in\r\n    size, roundish-oval, light red changed to violet-red by the bloom;\r\n    skin thin, astringent, juicy, tender, sweet, mild; quality good.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUTAUQUA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nIn appearance of fruit, Chautauqua is very similar to Concord, its\r\nparent, but the grapes ripen a few days earlier and are of better\r\nquality, although they do not differ in these respects sufficiently to\r\nmake the variety much more than an easily recognized strain of\r\nConcord. Chautauqua is a volunteer seedling of Concord, found near\r\nBrocton, New York, by H. T. Bashtite about 1890.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, unproductive. Canes long, thick,\r\n    cylindrical; internodes long; tendrils continuous, trifid. Leaves\r\n    large, irregularly round, dark green; upper surface dark green;\r\n    lower surface tinged with bronze; leaf entire or faintly\r\n    three-lobed. Flowers semi-fertile, open in mid-season or earlier;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early in mid-season. Clusters medium to large, broad,\r\n    sometimes single-shouldered, compact. Berries large, round or\r\n    slightly oval, purplish-black with abundant bloom, shatter badly;\r\n    skin thin, very astringent; flesh tough, vinous, sweet at skin,\r\n    acid at center; good to very good. Seeds few, free, broad, plump.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEVENER\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nThis variety has long been grown in New Jersey and New York, and in\r\nboth states is highly esteemed as a wine-grape. The fruit is\r\nremarkable in coloring very early and in ripening late. The vine is\r\nhardy, very vigorous, succeeds in various soils, and since it bears\r\ngrafts well is an excellent sort upon which to graft varieties not\r\nthriving on their own roots. Clevener is self-sterile and must be\r\nplanted with some other variety to set fruit well. In spite of its\r\ngood qualities, Clevener is hardly holding its own in commercial\r\nvineyards, and it is not a desirable fruit for the amateur who wants a\r\ntable-grape. Clevener has been raised in the vicinity of Egg Harbor,\r\nNew Jersey, since about 1870, but its place and time of origin are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n    Vine a rampant grower, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    thick, dark reddish-brown with heavy bloom; nodes enlarged;\r\n    tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves unusually large, dark green\r\n    with well-defined ribs showing through the thin pubescence of the\r\n    under surface; lobes wanting or faint; teeth deep, wide. Flowers\r\n    self-sterile, open very early; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters do not always fill well, small,\r\n    short, slender, irregularly tapering, often with a single\r\n    shoulder. Berries small, round or slightly flattened, black,\r\n    glossy, covered with heavy bloom, persistent, firm; skin tough,\r\n    thin, inclined to crack, adherent with much purplish-red pigment;\r\n    flesh reddish-green, juicy, tender, soft, fine-grained, aromatic,\r\n    spicy; good. Seeds free, notched, sharp-pointed, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLINTON\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Worthington_\r\n\r\nClinton (Plate X) came into prominence because of vigor, hardiness,\r\nfruitfulness and immunity to phylloxera. A serious defect is that the\r\nvines bloom so early that the blossoms are often caught by late frosts\r\nin northern climates. Other defects are: the fruit is small and sour,\r\nand the seeds and skins prominent. The fruit colors early in the\r\nseason but does not ripen until late, a slight touch of frost\r\nimproving the flavor. Clinton bears grafts well, making a quick and\r\nfirm union with Labrusca and Vinifera, and the vines are easily\r\npropagated from cuttings. This variety has been used widely in\r\ngrape-breeding, and its blood can be traced in many valuable\r\nvarieties. The offspring of Clinton are usually very hardy, and this,\r\ntaken with its other desirable characters, makes it an exceptionally\r\ngood starting-point for breeding grapes for northern latitudes.\r\nClinton is an old sort, the Worthington, known as early as 1815,\r\nrenamed; it began to attract attention about 1840.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    slender, reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; shoots smooth;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, sometimes continuous, bifid. Leaves hang\r\n    until late in the season, small, thin; upper surface dark green,\r\n    smooth; lower surface pale green, glabrous; petiolar sinus deep,\r\n    narrow, urn-shaped; basal and lateral sinuses shallow; teeth wide.\r\n    Flowers self-fertile, open early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season. Clusters small, slender, cylindrical, uniform,\r\n    single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, very slender, smooth;\r\n    brush tinged with red. Berries small, round, oval, purplish-black,\r\n    glossy, covered with thick bloom, adherent, firm; skin very\r\n    thin, tough, free from pulp with much wine-colored pigment,\r\n    astringent; flesh dark green, juicy, fine-grained, tough, solid,\r\n    spicy, sour, vinous. Seeds adherent, two, short, blunt, brownish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXV.--Muscat Hamburg (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLERAIN\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nThis is one of the numerous white seedlings of Concord and one of the\r\nfew with sufficient merit to be kept in cultivation. The vine has the\r\ncharacteristic foliage and habit of growth of its parent, but the\r\nfruit is earlier by a week, is of much higher quality and lacks the\r\nfoxiness of most Labruscas. The grapes are sprightly and vinous, and\r\nneither seeds nor skin are as objectionable as in the parent. The\r\nfruit hangs to the vine and keeps well, but owing to tender pulp does\r\nnot ship well. The variety is unproductive in some localities.\r\nColerain is worthy a place in home vineyards. David Bundy, Colerain,\r\nOhio, grew this variety from seed of Concord planted in 1880.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, unproductive. Canes slender, dark\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes flattened; internodes short, bifid. Leaves\r\n    thick; upper surface light green, dull, smooth; lower surface\r\n    bronze, downy; leaf not lobed, terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    wide; basal and lateral sinus very shallow when present; teeth\r\n    shallow. Flowers self-fertile, opening in mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early. Clusters medium in size and length, slender, blunt,\r\n    tapering, irregular, strongly shouldered, compact; pedicel\r\n    slender, smooth; brush green. Berries round, light green, glossy\r\n    with thin bloom, persistent; skin unusually thin, tender,\r\n    adherent, unpigmented, astringent; flesh pale green, translucent,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tender, soft, vinous, sweet; good. Seeds\r\n    free, one to three, small, broad, notched, short, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIAN IMPERIAL\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vulpina)\r\n\r\n_Columbian, Jumbo_\r\n\r\nColumbian Imperial is a Labrusca-Vulpina hybrid chiefly remarkable for\r\nthe great size of its reddish-black berries, although the vine is so\r\nexceptionally healthy and vigorous as to give it prominence for these\r\ncharacters as well. The variety has remarkably thick leathery leaves\r\nwhich seem almost proof against either insects or fungi. The quality\r\nof the fruit, however, is inferior, and the small clusters vary in\r\nnumber of berries and these shell easily. The only value of the\r\nvariety is for exhibition purposes and for breeding to secure the\r\ndesirable characters named. The parentage of Columbian Imperial is\r\nunknown. It originated with J. S. McKinley, Orient, Ohio, in 1885.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, unproductive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    thick, dark reddish-brown, heavily pubescent, spiny; nodes\r\n    prominent; internodes short; tendrils continuous, long, bifid.\r\n    Leaves green, very thick; lower surface pale green shading into\r\n    bronze on older leaves with little pubescence; lobes three,\r\n    indistinct; teeth sharp, shallow, wide. Flowers self-fertile;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late. Clusters medium in size, sometimes shouldered;\r\n    peduncle slender; pedicel long; brush long, slender, green.\r\n    Berries very large, round, slightly oval, dull reddish-black with\r\n    faint bloom, firm; skin thick, tough, unpigmented; flesh juicy,\r\n    tough, sweet at the skin but acid at center; fair in quality.\r\n    Seeds adherent, large, plump, broad, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCORD\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nConcord (Plate XI) is the most widely known of the grapes of this\r\ncontinent, and with its offspring, pure-bred and cross-bred, furnishes\r\n75 per cent of the grapes of eastern America. The preëminently\r\nmeritorious character of Concord is that it adapts itself to varying\r\nconditions; thus, Concord is grown with profit in every grape-growing\r\nstate in the Union and to an extent not possible with any\r\nother variety. A second character which commends Concord is\r\nfruitfulness--the vine bears large crops year in and year out. Added\r\nto these points of superiority, are: hardiness; ability to withstand\r\nthe ravages of diseases and insects; comparative earliness; certainty\r\nof maturity in northern regions; and fair size and handsome\r\nappearance of bunch and berry. Concord also blossoms late in the\r\nspring and does not suffer often from spring frosts, nor is the fruit\r\noften injured by late frosts. The crop hangs well on the vine.\r\n\r\nThe variety is not, however, without faults: the quality is not high,\r\nthe grapes lacking richness, delicacy of flavor and aroma, and having\r\na foxy taste disagreeable to many; the seeds and skin are\r\nobjectionable, the seeds being large and abundant and difficult to\r\nseparate from the flesh, and the skin being tough and unpleasantly\r\nastringent; the grapes do not keep nor ship well and rapidly lose\r\nflavor after ripening; the skin cracks and the berries shell from the\r\nstems after picking; and the vine is but slightly resistant to\r\nphylloxera. While Concord is grown in the South, it is essentially a\r\nnorthern grape, becoming susceptible to fungi in southern climates and\r\nsuffering from phylloxera in dry, warm soils.\r\n\r\nThe botanical characters of Concord indicate that it is a pure-bred\r\nLabrusca. Seeds of a wild grape were planted in the fall of 1843 by E.\r\nW. Bull, Concord, Massachusetts, plants from which fruited in 1849.\r\nOne of these seedlings was named Concord.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes long, thick, dark\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long; shoots\r\n    pubescent; tendrils continuous, long, bifid, sometimes trifid.\r\n    Leaves large, thick; upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth;\r\n    lower surface light bronze, heavily pubescent; lobes three when\r\n    present, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus variable; basal sinus\r\n    usually lacking; lateral sinus obscure and frequently notched;\r\n    teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps from one to two months. Clusters uniform,\r\n    large, wide, broadly tapering, usually single-shouldered,\r\n    sometimes double-shouldered, compact; pedicel thick, smooth; brush\r\n    pale green. Berries large, round, glossy, black with heavy bloom,\r\n    firm; skin tough, adherent with a small amount of wine-colored\r\n    pigment, astringent; flesh pale green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, tough, solid, foxy; good. Seeds adherent, one to\r\n    four, large, broad, distinctly notched, plump, blunt, brownish.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOTTAGE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nIn vine and fruit, Cottage resembles its parent, Concord, having,\r\nhowever, remarkably large, thick, leathery leaves. It is noted also\r\nfor its strong, branching root system and canes so rough as to be\r\nalmost spiny. The fruit is better in quality than that of its parent,\r\nhaving less foxiness and a richer, more delicate flavor. The crop\r\nripens from one to two weeks earlier than Concord. The good qualities\r\nof the variety are offset by comparative unproductiveness and\r\nunevenness in ripening. Cottage is recommended as an early grape of\r\nthe Concord type for the garden. This variety was grown from seed of\r\nConcord by E. W. Bull, Concord, Massachusetts. It was introduced in\r\n1869.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, hardy. Canes rough, hairy, long, numerous,\r\n    dark brown; nodes enlarged; shoots very pubescent; tendrils\r\n    continuous, bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n    glossy, smooth or rugose; lower surface tinged with bronze,\r\n    pubescent; leaf entire with terminal acute; petiolar sinus deep\r\n    and wide; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers self-fertile, open early;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit does not keep well. Clusters of medium size, broad,\r\n    cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    thick with a few small warts; brush dark red. Berries of medium\r\n    size, round, dull black with heavy bloom, drop badly from pedicel,\r\n    firm; skin thick, tender, adherent with dark purplish-red pigment,\r\n    astringent; flesh juicy, tough, solid, foxy; good. Seeds free, one\r\n    to four, large, broad, blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREVELING\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Bloom, Bloomburg, Catawissa, Columbia Bloom_\r\n\r\nCreveling was long a favorite black grape for the garden, where, if\r\nplanted in good soil, it produces fine clusters of large, handsome,\r\nvery good grapes. Under any but the best of care, however, the vine is\r\nunproductive and sets loose, straggling bunches. The variety is\r\nmarkedly self-sterile. The origin of Creveling is uncertain. It was\r\nintroduced about 1857 by F. F. Merceron, Catawissa, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, not hardy, often unproductive. Canes long,\r\n    numerous, thick, reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes long; shoots glabrous; tendrils continuous, long,\r\n    trifid or bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n    dull, rugose; lower surface pale green, pubescent; lobes three, or\r\n    obscurely five, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus deep, closed,\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus very shallow; lateral sinus shallow,\r\n    narrow; teeth shallow. Flowers on plan of six, self-sterile, open\r\n    in mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, does not keep well. Clusters long, broad, irregularly\r\n    tapering, single-shouldered, the shoulder often connected to the\r\n    cluster by a long stem, loose; brush thick, dark wine-color.\r\n    Berries large, oval, dull black, covered with heavy bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin thick, tough, adherent with wine-colored\r\n    pigment, astringent; flesh pale green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    stringy, tender, coarse, foxy; good. Seeds free, one to five,\r\n    broad, notched, blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROTON\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Croton is a feast both to the eye and to the palate.\r\nUnfortunately the vine is difficult to grow, being adapted to but few\r\nsoils and proving unfruitful, weak in growth, precariously tender and\r\nsubject to mildew and rot in unfavorable situations. The grapes have a\r\ndelicate, sweet Vinifera flavor with melting flesh which readily\r\nseparates from the few seeds. The crop hangs on the vines until frost\r\nand keeps well into the winter. In spite of high quality of fruit,\r\nCroton has never become widely distributed, wholly failing as a\r\ncommercial variety. It originated with S. W. Underhill, Croton Point,\r\nNew York, from a seed of Delaware pollinated by a European grape.\r\nFruits were first exhibited in 1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, tender, productive. Canes long, numerous, thick,\r\n    dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged; internodes short; shoots\r\n    glabrous; tendrils intermittent, long, bifid. Leaves of medium\r\n    size, hang late; upper surface light green, dull, smooth; lower\r\n    surface pale green, pubescent; lobes five, terminal one blunt;\r\n    basal sinus narrow; lateral sinus deep and narrow; petiolar sinus\r\n    narrow, often closed and overlapping; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers\r\n    self-fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters uniform, very large, long,\r\n    slender, irregularly tapering with heavy shoulder, very loose;\r\n    pedicel long, thick with inconspicuous warts; brush green. Berries\r\n    irregular in size, round-elongated, yellowish-green with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent, soft; skin thin, tough, adherent, unpigmented;\r\n    flesh green, transparent, very juicy, melting, vinous, pleasant,\r\n    agreeably sweet; very good. Seeds free, one to three, elongated,\r\n    notched, sharply pointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUNNINGHAM\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\n_Long, Prince Edward_\r\n\r\nCunningham is cultivated very little in America, but in France, at one\r\ntime, was one of the best-known grapes, both as a direct producer and\r\nas a stock for European varieties. It was much sought for by the\r\nFrench as a stock for large Vinifera cions, the size of the vine\r\ngiving an opportunity for making a good graft. In the South, where the\r\nvariety originated, Cunningham is not largely grown, as there are\r\nseveral other varieties of its type superior in fruit and vine. The\r\nvine is a capricious grower and is particular as to soil and climate.\r\nThe grapes make a deep yellow wine of a very good quality but have\r\nlittle value as table-grapes. Cunningham originated with Jacob\r\nCunningham, Prince Edward County, Virginia, about 1812.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, spreading, productive. Canes large, long with stiff\r\n    reddish hairs at base; shoots showing considerable bloom; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, usually trifid. Leaves large, thick, round, entire\r\n    or lobed; smooth and dark green above, yellowish green below,\r\n    pubescent; petiolar sinus narrow, frequently overlapping.\r\n\r\n    Clusters of medium size, long, sometimes shouldered, very compact;\r\n    pedicel long, slender with small warts; brush short, light brown.\r\n    Berries small, purplish-black with thin bloom; skin thin, tough\r\n    with much underlying pigment; flesh tender, juicy, sprightly;\r\n    quality poor or but fair. Seeds two to five, oval.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYNTHIANA\r\n\r\n(Æstivalis, Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Arkansas, Red River_\r\n\r\nThere is controversy as to whether this variety differs from Norton.\r\nThe two ripen at separate times, and the fruits differ a little so\r\nthat they must be considered as distinct. Cynthiana is particular as\r\nto soil and location, preferring sandy loams and does not thrive on\r\nclays or limestones. While very resistant to phylloxera, this variety\r\nis not much used as a resistant stock because it is not easily\r\npropagated. The vines are resistant to mildew, black-rot, and\r\nanthracnose and are strong, vigorous growers. The cycle of vegetation\r\nfor Cynthiana is long, the buds bursting forth early and the fruit\r\nmaturing very late. The variety has no value as a table-grape but in\r\nthe South is one of the best grapes for red wine. No doubt it will\r\nprove one of the best southern sorts for grape-juice. Cynthiana was\r\nreceived about 1850 by Prince, of Flushing, Long Island, from\r\nArkansas, where it was found growing in the woods.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes medium in length,\r\n    numerous, reddish-brown with thick bloom; nodes enlarged;\r\n    internodes short; shoots glabrous; tendrils intermittent or\r\n    continuous, bifid. Leaves thick, firm; upper surface dark green,\r\n    dull, rugose; lower surface tinged with blue, faintly pubescent,\r\n    cobwebby; lobes variable in number, terminal one acute; petiolar\r\n    sinus deep, narrow, closed, sometimes overlapping; basal sinus\r\n    shallow; lateral sinus shallow, narrow; teeth shallow; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, keeps well. Clusters medium to small, long,\r\n    tapering, often single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    slender, with numerous warts; brush short, thick, wine-colored.\r\n    Berries small, round, black, covered with heavy bloom, persistent,\r\n    firm; skin thin, tough, adherent with purple pigment, astringent;\r\n    flesh dark green, translucent, juicy, tough, firm, spicy, tart;\r\n    poor in quality. Seeds adherent, one to six, small, short, blunt,\r\n    dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana, Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_French Grape, Gray Delaware, Ladies' Choice, Powell, Ruff_\r\n\r\nDelaware (Plate VII) is used wherever American grapes are grown as the\r\nstandard to gauge the quality of other grapes. Added to high quality\r\nin fruit, the variety withstands climatic conditions to which all but\r\nthe most hardy varieties succumb, is adapted to many soils and\r\nconditions, and bears under most situations an abundant crop. These\r\nqualities make it, next to Concord, the most popular grape for garden\r\nand vineyard now grown in the United States. Besides the qualities\r\nnamed, the grapes mature sufficiently early to make the crop certain,\r\nare attractive in appearance, keep and ship well and are more immune\r\nthan other commercial varieties to black-rot. Faults of the variety\r\nare: small vine, slow growth, susceptibility to mildew, capriciousness\r\nin certain soils and small berries. The first two faults make it\r\nnecessary to plant the vines more closely than those of other\r\ncommercial varieties. Delaware succeeds best in deep, rich,\r\nwell-drained, warm soils, but even on these it must have good\r\ncultivation, close pruning and the crop must be thinned.\r\n\r\nDelaware is grown North and South, westward to the Rocky Mountains. It\r\nis now proving profitable in many southern locations as an early grape\r\nto ship to northern markets. It is an especially desirable grape to\r\ncultivate in small gardens because of its delicious, handsome fruit,\r\nits compact habit of growth and its ample and lustrous green,\r\ndelicately formed leaves which make it one of the most ornamental of\r\nthe grapes. Delaware can be traced to the garden of Paul H. Provost,\r\nFrenchtown, New Jersey, where it was growing early in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, and from whence it was taken to Delaware, Ohio, in 1849 and\r\nfrom there distributed to fruit-growers.\r\n\r\n    Vine weak, hardy, productive. Canes short, numerous, slender, dark\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    short, bifid. Leaves small; upper surface dark green, dull,\r\n    smooth; lower surface pale green, pubescent; lobes three to five\r\n    in number, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus narrow; basal sinus\r\n    narrow and shallow when present; lateral sinus deep, narrow; teeth\r\n    shallow. Flowers self-fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters small, slender, blunt,\r\n    cylindrical, regular, shouldered, compact; pedicel short, slender,\r\n    smooth; brush light brown. Berries uniform in size and shape,\r\n    small, round, light red, covered with thin bloom, persistent,\r\n    firm; skin thin, tough, adherent, unpigmented, astringent; flesh\r\n    light green, translucent, juicy, tender, aromatic, vinous,\r\n    refreshing, sweet; best in quality. Seeds free, one to four,\r\n    broad, notched, short, blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAMOND\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nFew other grapes surpass Diamond in quality and beauty of fruit. When\r\nto its desirable fruit characters are added hardiness, productiveness\r\nand vigor of vine, the variety is surpassed by no other green grape.\r\nDiamond is a diluted hybrid between Labrusca and Vinifera and the\r\ntouch of the exotic grape is just sufficient to give the fruit the\r\nrichness in flavor of the Old World grape and not overcome the\r\nrefreshing sprightliness of the native fox-grapes. The Vinifera\r\ncharacters are wholly recessive in vine and foliage, the plant\r\nresembling closely its American parent, Concord. Diamond is well\r\nestablished North and South and can be grown in as great a range of\r\nlatitude as Concord. Jacob Moore, Brighton, New York, grew Diamond\r\nabout 1870 from Concord seed fertilized by Iona.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes short, brown with a slight\r\n    red tinge; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, bifid. Leaves thick; upper surface light green,\r\n    dull, smooth; lower surface light bronze, downy; lobes three in\r\n    number, indistinct; petiolar sinus very shallow; teeth shallow.\r\n    Flowers self-fertile, open early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters medium to short, broad, blunt,\r\n    cylindrical, often single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    thick with a few inconspicuous warts; brush slender, pale green.\r\n    Berries large, ovate, green with a tinge of yellow, glossy,\r\n    covered with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin, tough,\r\n    adherent, astringent; flesh pale green, transparent, juicy,\r\n    tender, melting, fine-grained, aromatic, sprightly; very good.\r\n    Seeds free, one to four, broad and long, sharp-pointed,\r\n    yellowish-brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIANA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nDiana (Plate XII) is a seedling of Catawba to which its fruit bears\r\nstrong resemblance, differing chiefly in having lighter color, in\r\nbeing less pulpy and more juicy. The flavor resembles that of Catawba\r\nbut has less of the wild taste. The chief point of superiority of\r\nDiana over Catawba is in earliness, the crop ripening ten days sooner,\r\nmaking possible its culture far to the north. The defects of Diana\r\nare: the vine is tender in cold winters; the grapes ripen unevenly;\r\nthe berries and foliage are susceptible to fungi; and the vine is a\r\nshy bearer. Diana demands poor, dry, gravelly soil without much humus\r\nor nitrogen. On clays, loams or rich soils, the vines make a rank\r\ngrowth, and the fruits are few, late and of poor quality. The vine\r\nneeds to be long pruned and to have all surplus bunches removed,\r\nleaving a small crop to mature. Diana is a satisfactory grape for the\r\namateur, and where it does especially well proves profitable for the\r\nlocal market. Mrs. Diana Crehore, Milton, Massachusetts, grew Diana\r\nfrom seed of Catawba, planted about 1834.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, often unproductive. Canes\r\n    pubescent, long, reddish-brown, covered with thin bloom; nodes\r\n    enlarged, flattened; internodes long; tendrils intermittent, long,\r\n    bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface light green, heavily\r\n    pubescent; lobes three to five, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, wide, often closed and overlapping; basal sinus shallow;\r\n    lateral sinus narrow; teeth shallow. Flowers self-fertile, open in\r\n    mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters large, broad, tapering,\r\n    occasionally shouldered, compact; pedicel covered with small\r\n    warts; brush slender, pale green. Berries medium in size, slightly\r\n    ovate, light red covered with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    thick, tough, slightly adherent; flesh pale green, translucent,\r\n    juicy, tough, fine-grained, vinous, good. Seeds adherent, one to\r\n    three, light brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVI.--Niagara (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOWNING\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Æstivalis, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nDowning is well worthy a place in the garden because of the high\r\nquality, handsome appearance and good keeping qualities of the grapes.\r\nAdded to these qualities of the fruits are fair vigor and health of\r\nvine. When grown as far north as New York, the vine should be laid\r\ndown in the winter or receive other protection. In most seasons,\r\nunremitting warfare must be kept up to check mildew. In appearance of\r\nbunch and berry, Downing is distinct, the clusters being large and\r\nwell-formed and the berries having the oval shape of a Malaga. The\r\nflesh, also, shows _Vitis vinifera_ in texture and quality, while\r\nneither seeds nor skins are as objectionable as in pure-bred American\r\nvarieties. J. H. Ricketts, Newburgh, New York, first grew Downing\r\nabout 1865.\r\n\r\n    Vine tender to cold, unproductive. Canes short, few, slender, dark\r\n    green with an ash-gray tinge, surface covered with thin bloom,\r\n    often roughened with a few small warts; nodes much enlarged,\r\n    strongly flattened; internodes short; tendrils intermittent, bifid\r\n    or trifid. Leaves small, round, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n    glossy, rugose; lower surface dark green, glabrous; lobes one to\r\n    five, terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus narrow, closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus shallow and narrow when present; lateral\r\n    sinus shallow, narrow; teeth wide, deep. Flowers open late;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps until spring. Clusters large, long, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, sometimes loosely shouldered; pedicel slender,\r\n    covered with numerous warts; brush long, slender, green. Berries\r\n    large, markedly oval, dark purplish-black, glossy, covered with\r\n    light bloom, strongly persistent, firm; skin thick, tender,\r\n    adherent; flesh green with a yellow tinge, translucent, very\r\n    juicy, tender, fine-grained, vinous, mild; very good in quality.\r\n    Seeds free, one to three, notched, long, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRACUT AMBER\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nDracut Amber is representative of the red type of Labrusca. The fruit\r\nhas no particular merit, its thick skin, coarse pulp, seeds and foxy\r\ntaste all being objectionable. However, the vine is very hardy,\r\nproductive, and ripens its fruit early so that this variety becomes\r\nvaluable in locations where a vigorous, hardy, early grape is wanted.\r\nAsa Clement, Dracut, Massachusetts grew Dracut Amber from seed planted\r\nabout 1855.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous, dark\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils continuous, long, bifid\r\n    or trifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface dark green, dull,\r\n    smooth; lower surface pale green, cobwebby; lobes three to five\r\n    with terminal one obtuse; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; basal sinus\r\n    shallow, wide; teeth shallow. Flowers on plan of six,\r\n    semi-fertile, mid-season.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, season short. Clusters short, broad, cylindrical,\r\n    irregular, rarely shouldered, compact; pedicel short, covered with\r\n    warts; brush long, light yellowish-green. Berries medium to large,\r\n    oval, dull pale red or dark amber, covered with thin bloom, soft;\r\n    skin very thick, tender, adherent, astringent; flesh green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, tough, very foxy; inferior in quality. Seeds\r\n    adherent, two to five, large, broad, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUTCHESS\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana? Æstivalis?)\r\n\r\nDutchess (Plate XIII) is not grown largely in commercial vineyards\r\nbecause of several faults, as: the vine is tender to cold; the berries\r\ndo not ripen evenly; berries and foliage are susceptible to fungi; and\r\nin soils to which it is not adapted, berries and bunches are small. In\r\nspite of these defects, Dutchess should not be discarded by the\r\ngrape-lover, for there are few grapes of higher quality. The grapes\r\nare sweet and rich, yet do not cloy the appetite; although of but\r\nmedium size, they are attractive, being a beautiful amber color with\r\ndistinctive dots; the flesh is translucent, sparkling, fine-grained\r\nand tender; the seeds are small, few and part readily from the pulp;\r\nthe skin is thin, yet tough enough for good keeping; and the bunches\r\nare large and compact when well grown. The variety is self-fertile\r\nand, therefore, desirable when only a few vines are wanted. The\r\nclusters are especially fine when bagged. A. J. Caywood, Marlboro, New\r\nYork, grew Dutchess from seed of a white Concord seedling pollinated\r\nby mixed pollen of Delaware and Walter. The seed was planted in 1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, an uncertain bearer. Canes dark brown with light\r\n    bloom, surface roughened; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils intermittent, short, bifid or trifid. Leaves\r\n    irregular in outline; upper surface pale green, pubescent; leaf\r\n    entire with terminus acute; petiolar sinus narrow; basal sinus\r\n    shallow when present; lateral sinus medium in depth or a mere\r\n    notch. Flowers self-fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters large, long,\r\n    slender, tapering with a prominent single shoulder; pedicel\r\n    slender, smooth; brush amber-colored. Berries of medium size,\r\n    round, pale yellow-green verging on amber, some showing bronze\r\n    tinge with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin sprinkled with small\r\n    dark dots, thin, tough, adherent; flesh pale green, translucent,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tender, vinous, sweet, of pleasant flavor;\r\n    quality high. Seeds free, one, two or occasionally three, small,\r\n    short, sharp-pointed, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY DAISY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nThe qualities of Early Daisy render the variety more than commonplace.\r\nIts earliness commends it, the ripening period being eight or ten days\r\nearlier than Champion or Moore Early, making it one of the very\r\nearliest varieties. For a grape maturing at its season, it both keeps\r\nand ships well. Early Daisy would seem to be as desirable as Hartford\r\nor Champion. The variety originated with John Kready, Mount Joy,\r\nPennsylvania, in 1874, as a seedling of Hartford.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, produces fair crops. Canes of medium length,\r\n    numerous, slender, reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves small, light green; upper\r\n    surface rugose; lower surface slightly pubescent, cobwebby; lobes\r\n    wanting or faintly three; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; teeth\r\n    shallow, narrow. Flowers nearly self-sterile.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early. Clusters small to medium, often blunt at ends,\r\n    cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    slender, smooth; brush reddish, slender. Berries of medium size,\r\n    round, dull black, covered with heavy bloom, persistent; skin\r\n    tough, purplish-red pigment; flesh tough, solid, aromatic, tart at\r\n    the skin, acid at center; inferior in flavor and quality. Seeds\r\n    numerous, adherent, of average size, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY OHIO\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nEarly Ohio is remarkable, chiefly, in being one of the earliest\r\ncommercial grapes. The fruit resembles that of Concord, of which it is\r\nprobably a seedling. Notwithstanding many defects, Early Ohio is grown\r\nsomewhat commonly, although its culture is on the wane. The variety\r\nwas found in 1882 by R. A. Hunt, Euclid, Ohio, between rows of\r\nDelaware and Concord.\r\n\r\n    Vine weak, tender, usually unproductive. Canes short, slender,\r\n    brown with a red tinge; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils continuous, short, bifid. Leaves intermediate in\r\n    size; upper surface light green, dull, smooth; lower surface pale\r\n    green tinged with bronze, pubescent; lobes wanting or one to\r\n    three, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus shallow, wide; basal\r\n    sinus usually absent; lateral sinus shallow, narrow; teeth\r\n    shallow. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, does not keep well. Clusters medium in size,\r\n    tapering; pedicel slender with a few small warts; brush slender,\r\n    tinged with red. Berries variable in size, round, purplish-black,\r\n    glossy with heavy bloom, persistent, firm; skin adherent,\r\n    astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy, tough, aromatic; poor\r\n    in quality. Seeds adherent, one to four, notched, brown with\r\n    yellowish-brown tips.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY VICTOR\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana?)\r\n\r\nEarly Victor is highest in quality of early black grapes. It is\r\nespecially pleasing to those who object to the foxiness so marked in\r\nHartford and Champion. Were the season but a few days earlier and\r\nbunch and berry a little larger, Early Victor would be the best grape\r\nto start the grape season. The vines are hardy, healthy, vigorous and\r\nproductive, with growth and foliage resembling Hartford, which is\r\nprobably one of its parents, Delaware being the other. The bunches are\r\nsmall, compact, variable in shape and the berries are about the size\r\nand shape of those of Delaware. Its season is that of Moore Early or a\r\nlittle later, although, like many black grapes, the fruit colors\r\nbefore it is ripe and is often picked too green. Unfortunately the\r\nfruit is susceptible to black-rot and shrivels after ripening. John\r\nBurr, Leavenworth, Kansas, first grew Early Victor about 1871.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    slender, dark brown, surface pubescent; nodes enlarged; internodes\r\n    long; tendrils continuous, bifid, sometimes trifid. Leaves thick;\r\n    upper surface dark green, smooth; lower surface white, heavily\r\n    pubescent; lobes three to five, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    intermediate in depth and width; basal sinus shallow and wide when\r\n    present; lateral sinus narrow. Flowers semi-sterile, open in\r\n    mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early, does not keep well. Clusters small, variable in\r\n    shape, cylindrical, frequently single-shouldered, compact; pedicel\r\n    short, covered with numerous small warts; brush wine-colored or\r\n    pinkish-red. Berries small, round, dark purplish-black, dull with\r\n    heavy bloom, persistent; skin thin, tough, adherent, contains much\r\n    red pigment, astringent; flesh greenish-white, opaque,\r\n    fine-grained, aromatic, vinous; good. Seeds adherent, one to four,\r\n    broad, notched, blunt, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEATON\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nEaton (Plate XIV) is a pure-bred seedling of Concord which it\r\nsurpasses in appearance but does not equal in quality of fruit. The\r\nflesh is tough and stringy, and though sweet at the skin, is acid at\r\nthe seeds and has the same foxiness that characterizes Concord, but\r\nwith more juice and less richness, so that it is well described as a\r\n\"diluted\" Concord. The grape-skin is very similar to that of Concord,\r\nand the fruit packs, ships and keeps about the same, perhaps not quite\r\nas well because of the greater amount of juice. The season is a few\r\ndays earlier than Concord. The vine is similar in all characters to\r\nthat of its parent. The grapes ripen unevenly, the flowers are\r\nself-sterile, and in some locations the vine is a shy bearer. The\r\nvariety has not found favor with either grower or consumer. Eaton\r\noriginated with Calvin Eaton, Concord, New Hampshire, about 1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes thick, light\r\n    brown with blue bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils continuous, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves large,\r\n    round, thick; upper surface dark green; lower surface tinged with\r\n    bronze, heavily pubescent; lobes three, terminal one acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus shallow, wide; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral\r\n    sinus shallow, narrow, often notched; teeth shallow. Flowers\r\n    semi-sterile, early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season. Clusters large, short, broad, blunt, sometimes\r\n    double-shouldered, compact; pedicel long, thick, smooth; brush\r\n    slender, pale green. Berries large, round, black with heavy bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin tough, adherent, purplish-red pigment,\r\n    astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy, tough, stringy, foxy;\r\n    fair in quality. Seeds adherent, one to four, broad, notched,\r\n    plump, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nECLIPSE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nEclipse (Plate XV) is a seedling of Niagara and, therefore, a\r\ndescendant of Concord which it resembles, differing chiefly in earlier\r\nfruit which is of better quality. Unfortunately, the bunches and\r\nberries are small. The vines are hardly surpassed by those of any\r\nother variety, being hardy, healthy and productive, qualities that\r\nshould commend it for commercial vineyards. The ripe fruit hangs on\r\nthe vines for some time without deterioration, and the grapes do not\r\ncrack in wet weather. The crop ripens several days earlier than that\r\nof Concord. Eclipse originated with E. A. Riehl, Alton, Illinois,\r\nfrom seed planted about 1890.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes medium in length, dark\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes enlarged; tendrils continuous, long, bifid.\r\n    Leaves large; upper surface dark green; lower surface white with a\r\n    bronze tinge, heavily pubescent; lobes wanting or three with\r\n    terminal one acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; basal sinus\r\n    usually lacking; lateral sinus narrow, often notched; teeth\r\n    shallow, narrow. Flowers self-sterile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters of medium size, broad, tapering,\r\n    frequently single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, thick,\r\n    covered with small warts; brush long, pale green. Berries, large,\r\n    oval, dull black with abundant bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    tender, slightly adherent, astringent; flesh pale green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, tender, fine-grained, foxy, sweet; good. Seeds\r\n    free, one to four, short, broad, distinctly notched, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDEN\r\n\r\n(Rotundifolia, Munsoniana?)\r\n\r\nEden is of value as a general-purpose grape for the South and is\r\ninteresting as one of the few supposed hybrids with _V. rotundifolia_.\r\nIt is probably a hybrid between the species named and _V. Munsoniana_,\r\nanother southern wild grape. The vine is exceedingly vigorous and\r\nproductive and thrives on clay soils, whereas most other Rotundifolias\r\ncan be grown successfully only on sandy lands. Eden was found some\r\nyears ago on the premises of Dr. Guild, near Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, productive, healthy and bearing a dense canopy\r\n    of foliage. Canes darker in color than most other Rotundifolias.\r\n    Leaves of medium size and thickness, longer than wide; petiolar\r\n    sinus wide; marginal teeth rounded; leaf-tip blunt. Flowers\r\n    perfect.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, distinct first and second crops, ripens uniformly.\r\n    Clusters large, loose, bearing from five to twenty-five berries\r\n    which adhere fairly well to the pedicels. Berries round, one-half\r\n    inch in diameter, dull black, faintly specked; skin thin, tender;\r\n    flesh soft, juicy, pale green, sprightly; good in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nELDORADO\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Eldorado is delicately flavored, with a distinct aroma\r\nand taste and ripens about with that of Moore Early--a time when there\r\nare few other good white grapes. The vines inherit most of the good\r\nqualities of Concord, one of its parents, excepting ability to set\r\nlarge crops. Even with cross-pollination, Eldorado sometimes fails to\r\nbear and is not worth growing unless planted in a mixed vineyard. The\r\nclusters are so often small and straggling under the best conditions\r\nthat the variety cannot be recommended highly to the amateur; yet its\r\ndelightful flavor and its earliness commend it. J. H. Ricketts,\r\nNewburgh, New York, grew Eldorado about 1870 from seed of Concord\r\nfertilized by Allen's Hybrid.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, an uncertain bearer. Canes long, few, thick,\r\n    flattened, bright reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, rarely continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves\r\n    large to medium, irregularly round, dark green; upper surface\r\n    rugose on older leaves; lower surface tinged with brown,\r\n    pubescent; lobes wanting or faintly three; petiolar sinus deep;\r\n    teeth shallow. Flowers self-sterile, open late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters do not always set perfectly and\r\n    are variable in size, frequently single-shouldered; pedicel short,\r\n    slender, smooth; brush short, yellow. Berries large, round,\r\n    yellowish-green changing to golden yellow, covered with thin\r\n    bloom; flesh tender, foxy, sweet, mild, high flavored; good to\r\n    very good in quality. Seeds intermediate in size and length,\r\n    blunt, yellowish-brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nELVIRA\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nAlthough it has never attained popularity in the North, Elvira (Plate\r\nXVI), after its introduction into Missouri about forty years ago,\r\nreached the pinnacle of popularity as a wine-grape in the South. The\r\nqualities which commended it were: great productiveness; earliness,\r\nripening in the North with Concord; exceedingly good health, being\r\nalmost free from fungal diseases; great vigor, as shown by a strong,\r\nstocky growth and ample foliage; and almost perfect hardiness even as\r\nfar north as Canada. Its good qualities are offset by two defects:\r\nthin skin which bursts easily, thus wholly debarring it from distant\r\nmarkets; and flavor and appearance not sufficiently good to make it a\r\ntable-grape. Elvira originated with Jacob Rommel, Morrison, Missouri,\r\nfrom seed of Taylor.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes numerous, dark\r\n    brown; nodes flattened; internodes short; tendrils continuous,\r\n    trifid or bifid. Leaves large, thin; upper surface light green,\r\n    pubescent, hairy; lobes wanting or one to three with terminus\r\n    acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, sometimes closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow,\r\n    often notched; teeth deep, wide. Flowers self-fertile, open early;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, does not keep well. Clusters short, cylindrical,\r\n    usually single-shouldered, compact; pedicel smooth; brush short,\r\n    greenish-yellow with brown tinge. Berries medium in size, round,\r\n    green with yellow tinge, dull with thin bloom, firm; skin very\r\n    thin, tender, adherent, astringent; flesh green, juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, tender, foxy, sweet; fair in quality. Seeds free,\r\n    one to four, medium to large, blunt, plump, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPEROR\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nEmperor is one of the standard shipping grapes of the Pacific slope,\r\nbeing one of the mainstays of the interior valleys. On the coast and\r\nin southern California, it is irregular in bearing, and on the coast\r\nthe fruits often fail to ripen. It is chiefly grown in the San Joaquin\r\nValley. It could hardly be expected to ripen even in the most favored\r\ngrape regions in the East. The following brief description is\r\ncompiled:\r\n\r\n    Vine strong, healthy and productive. Leaves very large, with five\r\n    shallow lobes; teeth short and obtuse; light green in color;\r\n    glabrous above, wooly beneath. Bunches very large, loose,\r\n    sometimes inclined to be straggling, long-conical. Berries large,\r\n    dull purple, oval; flesh firm and crisp; skin thick; flavor and\r\n    quality good. Ripens late and keeps and ships well.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPIRE STATE\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nEmpire State (Plate XVII) competes with Niagara and Diamond for\r\nsupremacy among green grapes. The variety is as vigorous in growth, as\r\nfree from parasites, and on vines of the same age is as productive,\r\nbut is less hardy, and the grapes are not as attractive in appearance\r\nas those of the other varieties named. In particular, the clusters are\r\nsmall in some localities, a defect which can be overcome only by\r\nsevere pruning or by thinning. The quality is very good, approaching\r\nthe flavor of the Old World grapes, its slight wild taste suggesting\r\none of the Muscats. Empire State ripens early, hangs long on the vine\r\nand keeps well after picking without losing flavor. This grape\r\noriginated with James H. Ricketts, Newburgh, New York, bearing fruit\r\nfirst in 1879.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, somewhat tender. Canes short, few, slender,\r\n    brownish; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    bifid. Leaves small; upper surface light green, glossy, smooth or\r\n    somewhat rugose; lower surface tinged with bronze, heavily\r\n    pubescent; lobes three to five when present, terminal one\r\n    acuminate; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, often closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus variable in depth and width; lateral\r\n    sinus deep, narrow, often enlarged at base; teeth deep, wide.\r\n    Flowers self-fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, long, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, frequently single-shouldered, compact; pedicel\r\n    slender with small warts; brush short, light green. Berries medium\r\n    or small, round, pale yellowish-green, covered with thin bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin thick, adherent to the pulp, slightly\r\n    astringent; flesh pale yellowish-green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, tender, agreeably flavored; good to very good. Seeds\r\n    adherent, one to four, small, broad, notched, short, blunt, plump,\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVII.--Salem (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\nETTA\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nIn appearance, taste and texture of fruit, Etta is very similar to\r\nElvira, of which it is a seedling. The small, yellow clusters which\r\ncharacterize Elvira are reproduced in Etta, which differs chiefly in\r\nhaving a shoulder quite as large as the main bunch itself and in\r\nhaving a better flavor, lacking the slight foxiness of Elvira. The\r\nvine is very vigorous, hardy, and is productive to a fault. The fruit\r\nripens with that of Catawba. The tendency of Elvira to crack and\r\noverbear influenced the originator of that variety, Jacob Rommel,\r\nMorrison, Missouri, to try for a grape without these faults, and the\r\nresult was Etta from seed of Elvira. The fruit was first exhibited in\r\n1879.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous, light\r\n    to dark brown; tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves large, thick;\r\n    upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth; lower surface pale\r\n    green, somewhat cobwebby. Flowers self-fertile, early; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters small, short, broad, irregularly\r\n    cylindrical, usually with a short, single shoulder but sometimes\r\n    so heavily shouldered as to form a double bunch, very compact.\r\n    Berries small, round, pale green, dull with thin bloom, shattering\r\n    when over-ripe, firm; skin thin, tender; flesh juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, tough, stringy, slightly foxy, mild; fair in\r\n    quality. Seeds free, long, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUMELAN\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Æstivalis)\r\n\r\n_Washington_\r\n\r\nThe good qualities of Eumelan are: vines above the average in vigor,\r\nhardiness and productiveness; clusters and berries well formed, of\r\ngood size and handsome color; flesh tender, dissolving into wine-like\r\njuice under slight pressure; and pure flavor, rich, sweet, vinous. The\r\nseason is early, yet the fruit keeps much better than that of most\r\nother grapes maturing with it and becomes, therefore, a mid-season\r\nand late grape. The defects of the variety are susceptibility to\r\nmildew, self-sterile flowers and difficulty in propagation. The latter\r\ncharacter has greatly hindered its culture, as the vines can be\r\nsecured only at extra expense and nurserymen are loath to grow the\r\nvariety at all. Eumelan may be recommended to amateur growers. It is a\r\nchance seedling which grew from seed, about 1847, in the yard of a Mr.\r\nThorne, Fishkill Landing, New York.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes numerous, covered with\r\n    bloom; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    long, trifid or bifid. Leaves large; upper surface dark green,\r\n    glossy, smooth; lower surface pale green, smooth; lobes usually\r\n    three with terminal one acute; petiolar sinus deep, variable in\r\n    width; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow, narrow;\r\n    teeth shallow. Flowers self-sterile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps until late winter. Clusters long, slender,\r\n    tapering, often with a long, loose, single shoulder; pedicel\r\n    short, slender with a few small warts; brush short, stubby, pale\r\n    green. Berries of medium size, round, black, glossy with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent, firm; skin tough, adherent with wine-colored\r\n    pigment, astringent; flesh dark green, juicy, fine-grained,\r\n    tender, stringy, spicy and aromatic, sweet; good. Seeds adherent,\r\n    one to four, large, wide, blunt, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAITH\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nAlthough spoken of as a desirable grape in some regions, Faith is of\r\nlittle value in most localities. The fruit is unattractive in\r\nappearance, and the quality is not high. If the variety has any\r\npreëminently good character, it is productiveness. The blossoms put\r\nforth so early that they often suffer from spring frosts. Faith is of\r\nthe same breeding as Etta and from the same originator, Jacob Rommel,\r\nMorrison, Missouri, both having come from seed of Elvira.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    thick, cylindrical; nodes prominent; internodes long; tendrils\r\n    continuous, bifid. Leaves large, dark green; upper surface dark\r\n    green, dull; lower surface grayish-green, thinly pubescent; lobes\r\n    wanting or faint; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers self-sterile to\r\n    partly self-fertile, open early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, does not keep well. Clusters medium in size, variable\r\n    in length, usually slender, often heavily single-shouldered,\r\n    loose; pedicel short, slender, warty; brush pale green, slender.\r\n    Berries small, round, dull green, frequently with a yellow tinge\r\n    changing to pale amber, with abundant bloom, persistent, soft;\r\n    skin thin, adherent, astringent; flesh juicy, tender, agreeably\r\n    flavored; fair to good in quality. Seeds numerous, broad, dark\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEHER SZAGOS\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThis variety succeeds rather well at Geneva, New York, bearing fruits\r\nof excellent quality. It has two defects, dull color of the berries\r\nand irregular bunches. It is worth trying in the East. Feher Szagos is\r\nsaid to make a very good raisin in California and usually appears in\r\nlists of table-grapes for that state.\r\n\r\n    Vines vigorous, somewhat uncertain bearers. Opening leaves\r\n    pubescent, red along the edges and a tinge of red on the upper\r\n    surface. Flowers have upright stamens. Fruit usually ripens the\r\n    first week in October and does not keep well in storage; clusters\r\n    large to medium, broad, loose, frequently irregular because of\r\n    poor setting of fruit; berries large, oval to elliptical, rather\r\n    dull green, with thin bloom; skin thick, tender, neutral; flesh\r\n    greenish, translucent, juicy, meaty, tender, sweet; quality of the\r\n    best; seeds free.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERN MUNSON\r\n\r\n(Lincecumii, Vinifera, Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Admirable, Fern, Hilgarde, Munson's No. 76_\r\n\r\nFern Munson is a southern grape not adapted to northern regions, 40°\r\nnorth latitude being its limit of adaptation. The fruits show some\r\nvery good characters, as attractive appearance, agreeable quality and\r\nunobjectionable seeds and skin. The vines are vigorous and\r\nproductive, but the foliage is not healthy although very abundant.\r\nThis variety originated with T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, from seed\r\nof Post-oak with mixed pollen. The seed was planted in 1885, and the\r\nvariety was introduced by the originator in 1893.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy. Canes long, numerous, thick, dark\r\n    brown with a faint red tinge; tendrils intermittent, bifid. Leaves\r\n    large, thick; upper surface rugose and heavily wrinkled; lower\r\n    surface dull, pale green with a bronze tinge, faintly pubescent.\r\n    Flowers semi-fertile, open very late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters large, irregularly tapering,\r\n    usually single-shouldered, often with many abortive fruits.\r\n    Berries large, round, slightly flattened, dark purplish-black,\r\n    glossy, covered with thin bloom, strongly persistent, firm; skin\r\n    thin, tough, astringent; flesh juicy, tough, firm, fine-grained,\r\n    vinous, briskly subacid; good. Seeds adherent, broad.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAME TOKAY\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThis is the leading shipping grape of the Pacific slope where it is\r\neverywhere grown under the name \"Tokay,\" with several modifying terms,\r\nas \"Flame,\" \"Flame-colored\" and \"Flaming.\" The fruit is not especially\r\nhigh in quality nor attractive in appearance, but it ships and keeps\r\nwell, qualities making it popular in commercial vineyards. The\r\ndescription is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, luxuriant in growth of canes, shoots and\r\n    leaves; very productive; wood dark brown, straight with long\r\n    joints. Leaves dark green with a brown tinge; lightly lobed.\r\n    Bunches very large, sometimes weighing eight or nine pounds,\r\n    moderately compact; shouldered. Berries large, oblong, red when\r\n    mature, covered with lilac bloom; flesh firm, crisp, sweet;\r\n    quality good. Season late, keeps and ships well.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERS\r\n\r\n(Rotundifolia)\r\n\r\nFlowers is a late, dark-colored Rotundifolia very popular in the\r\nCarolinas. The variety is noted for its vigorous and productive\r\nvines, its large fruit-clusters and grapes that cling in the cluster\r\nunusually well for a variety of this species. The crop ripens in North\r\nCarolina in October and November. The fruit is valuable only for wine\r\nand grape-juice, having little to recommend it for dessert purposes.\r\nFlowers was found in a swamp near Lamberton, North Carolina, more than\r\na hundred years ago by William Flowers. Improved Flowers, probably a\r\nseedling of Flowers, was found near Whiteville, North Carolina, about\r\n1869. It differs from its supposed parent in having a more vigorous\r\nand productive vine and larger clusters, the berries of which cling\r\neven more tenaciously.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, upright, open, very productive. Canes\r\n    long, slender, numerous. Leaves variable but average medium in\r\n    size, longer than broad, pointed, cordate, thick, dark green,\r\n    smooth, leathery; margins sharply serrate; flowers perfect.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late, keeps well. Clusters, large, consisting of ten to\r\n    twenty-five berries. Berries large, round-oblong, purple or\r\n    purplish-black, clinging well to the cluster-stem; skin thick,\r\n    tough, faintly marked with dots; pulp white, lacking in juice,\r\n    hard, sweetish, austere in flavor; poor for a table-grape but\r\n    excellent for grape-juice.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAERTNER\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nThe berries and clusters of Gaertner are large and handsomely colored,\r\nmaking a very showy grape. The plant is vigorous, productive and as\r\nhardy as any of the hybrids between Labrusca and Vinifera. In view of\r\nthese qualities, Gaertner has not received the attention it deserves,\r\nprobably because it is more capricious as to soils than some others of\r\nits related hybrids. As a market grape, the variety has the faults of\r\nripening unevenly and of shipping poorly. The fruit keeps well and\r\nthis, with the desirable qualities noted, makes it an excellent grape\r\nfor the home vineyard. Gaertner is often compared with Massasoit, the\r\ntwo varieties being very similar in fruit characters, but Gaertner is\r\nof distinctly better quality than Massasoit. The variety originated\r\nwith E. S. Rogers, Salem, Massachusetts. It was first mentioned about\r\n1865.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy except in severe winters, productive. Canes\r\n    long, dark reddish-brown, surface covered with thin bloom;\r\n    tendrils continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves medium in size,\r\n    round; upper surface dark green; lower surface pale green,\r\n    pubescent. Flowers self-sterile, open late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, matures unevenly, keeps only fairly well.\r\n    Clusters medium in size, short, cylindrical, usually with a single\r\n    shoulder but sometimes double-shouldered, loose with many abortive\r\n    fruits. Berries large, round-oval, light to dark red, glossy,\r\n    covered with bloom, persistent; skin thin, tender; flesh pale\r\n    green, juicy, fine-grained, tough, stringy, agreeably vinous; good\r\n    to very good. Seeds free, large, broad, distinctly notched, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENEVA\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nGeneva is surpassed by so many other grapes of its season in quality\r\nthat it has never become popular, although it has much to recommend\r\nit. The vine is vigorous and productive, although not quite hardy, and\r\nthe berries and clusters are attractive; the fruit is nearly\r\ntransparent and there is so little bloom that the grapes are a\r\nlustrous green or iridescent in sunlight; the berries cling well to\r\nthe stem and the fruit keeps exceptionally well. Geneva originated\r\nwith Jacob Moore, Brighton, New York, from seed planted in 1874 from a\r\nhybrid vine fertilized by Iona.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, productive. Canes covered with thin bloom;\r\n    tendrils intermittent or continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves\r\n    medium in size; upper surface light green, dull; lower surface\r\n    grayish-white, pubescent; lobes three to five, acute; petiolar\r\n    sinus, shallow, wide; teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers self-sterile\r\n    or partly fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ships well and keeps into the winter. Clusters\r\n    large, blunt at the ends, usually not shouldered, with many\r\n    abortive fruits; pedicel long, slender, smooth; brush long, green.\r\n    Berries large, oval, dull green changing to a faint yellow with\r\n    thin bloom; skin thick, tough, unpigmented; flesh pale green,\r\n    tender, soft, vinous, sweet at skin but tart at center; fair to\r\n    good. Seeds of medium size and length.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOETHE\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nOf all Rogers' hybrids, Goethe shows Vinifera characters most,\r\nresembling in appearance the White Malaga of Europe, and not falling\r\nfar short of the best Old World grapes in quality. But the variety is\r\ndifficult to grow, especially where the seasons are not long enough\r\nfor full maturity. The vine is vigorous to a fault; it is fairly\r\nimmune to mildew, rot and other diseases; and, where it succeeds, the\r\nvines bear so freely that thinning becomes a necessity. Added to high\r\nquality, which makes it an excellent table-grape, Goethe keeps well.\r\nGoethe was first mentioned in 1858 under the name of Rogers' No. 1.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy. Canes short, dark brown; nodes enlarged,\r\n    flattened; internodes short; tendrils continuous or intermittent,\r\n    long, bifid to trifid. Leaves irregularly round, thin; upper\r\n    surface light green, glossy; lower surface pale green, pubescent;\r\n    leaf usually not lobed, terminus broadly acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    narrow, closed and overlapping; basal sinus usually lacking;\r\n    lateral sinus shallow, often a notch; teeth shallow, narrow.\r\n    Flowers partly self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters short, broad, tapering,\r\n    frequently single-shouldered, usually two bunches to shoot;\r\n    pedicel long, thick with numerous conspicuous warts; brush long,\r\n    slender, yellowish-brown. Berries very large, oval, pale red\r\n    covered with thin bloom, persistent; skin thin, tender, adherent,\r\n    faintly astringent; flesh pale green, translucent, tender with\r\n    Vinifera flavor; very good. Seeds adherent, one to three, large,\r\n    long, notched, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOLD COIN\r\n\r\n(Æstivalis, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nIn the South, where alone it thrives, Gold Coin is a handsome market\r\nvariety of very good quality. The vines are productive and are\r\nunusually free from attacks of fungal diseases. The variety\r\noriginated with T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, from seed of Cynthiana\r\nor Norton pollinated by Martha and was introduced by the originator in\r\n1894.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes slender, numerous;\r\n    tendrils continuous, sometimes intermittent, trifid or bifid.\r\n    Leaves medium in size; upper surface light green, slightly rugose;\r\n    lower surface pale green, tinged with bronze, heavily pubescent.\r\n    Flowers self-fertile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season, keeps long. Clusters medium to small,\r\n    usually single-shouldered. Berries large, round-oval,\r\n    yellowish-green with a distinct trace of reddish-amber, with thin\r\n    bloom, usually persistent; skin covered with small, scattering\r\n    brown dots, thin, tough; flesh faintly aromatic, tart from skin to\r\n    center; good. Seeds free, numerous, medium in size.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREEN EARLY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nGreen Early is a white grape coming in season with Winchell, which\r\nsurpasses it in most characters, quality in particular. Green Early\r\nwas found in 1885, growing by the side of a ditch near a Concord\r\nvineyard, on land belonging to O. J. Green, Portland, New York.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes variable in length and\r\n    thickness, dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes short; tendrils continuous, sometimes intermittent,\r\n    bifid or trifid. Leaves variable in size, medium green; upper\r\n    surface dark green, glossy; lower surface pale green, pubescent;\r\n    lobes wanting or faintly five; teeth shallow, narrow; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, does not keep well. Clusters variable in size, length\r\n    and breadth, sometimes single-shouldered, variable in compactness.\r\n    Berries large, oval, light green tinged with yellow, with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent, soft; skin thin, tender, inclined to crack;\r\n    flesh tough and aromatic, sweet at skin but acid at center; fair\r\n    in quality. Seeds medium in size, length and breadth,\r\n    sharp-pointed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREIN GOLDEN\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nGrein Golden is very similar to Riesling, but the vine is much\r\nstronger in growth. For a variety of the Taylor group, both cluster\r\nand berry are large and uniform, which, with the attractive color of\r\nthe berries, make it a most handsome fruit. The flavor, however, is\r\nnot at all pleasing, being an unusual commingling of sweetness and\r\nacidity very disagreeable to most palates. The quality of the fruit\r\ncondemns it for table use, although it is said to make a very good\r\nwhite wine. Nicholas Grein, Hermann, Missouri, first grew Grein Golden\r\nabout 1875.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous, slender,\r\n    dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, trifid or bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, dull, smooth; lower surface pale green,\r\n    lightly pubescent; lobes lacking or one to three with terminus\r\n    acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; basal sinus usually lacking;\r\n    lateral sinus shallow, wide, obscure; teeth deep. Flowers\r\n    self-sterile, open in mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season. Clusters large, long, broad, tapering,\r\n    irregular, often heavily single-shouldered, loose; pedicel with a\r\n    few inconspicuous warts; brush slender, pale green. Berries\r\n    uniform in size, large, round, golden yellow, glossy with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent; skin very thin, tender; flesh green,\r\n    translucent, very juicy, tender, vinous; good. Seeds free, one to\r\n    four, broad, plump, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROS COLMAN\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Dodrelabi_\r\n\r\nGros Colman has the reputation of being the handsomest black\r\ntable-grape grown. It is one of the favorite hot-house grapes in\r\nEngland and eastern America and is commonly grown out of doors in\r\nCalifornia. The variety is remarkable for having the largest berries\r\nof any round grape, borne in immense bunches, and for the long-keeping\r\nqualities, although the tender skins sometimes crack. The following\r\ndescription is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy and productive; wood dark brown. Leaves\r\n    very large, round, thick, but slightly lobed; teeth short and\r\n    blunt; glabrous above, wooly below. Bunches very large, short,\r\n    well filled but rather loose; berries very large, round, dark\r\n    blue; skin thick but tender; flesh firm, crisp, sweet and good;\r\n    quality not of the highest. Season late and the fruits keep long.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARTFORD\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nThe vine of Hartford may be well characterized by its good qualities,\r\nbut the fruit is best described by its faults, because of which the\r\nvariety is passing out of cultivation. The plants are vigorous,\r\nprolific, healthy and the fruit is borne early in the season. The\r\ncanes are remarkable for their stoutness and for the crooks at the\r\njoints. The bunches are not unattractive, but the quality of the fruit\r\nis low, the flesh being pulpy and the flavor insipid and foxy. The\r\nberries shell badly on the vine and when packed for shipping, so that\r\nthe fruit does not ship, pack or keep well. The grapes color long\r\nbefore ripe, and the flowers are only partly self-fertile, so that in\r\nseasons when there is bad weather during blooming time the clusters\r\nare loose and straggling. The original vine of Hartford was a chance\r\nseedling in the garden of Paphro Steele, West Hartford, Connecticut.\r\nIt fruited first in 1849.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, very productive. Canes long, dark brown, covered\r\n    with pubescence; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short;\r\n    tendrils continuous, long, bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface pale green, thinly\r\n    pubescent; lobes variable; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; basal\r\n    sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow, narrow; teeth\r\n    shallow. Flowers partly self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early. Clusters medium in size, long, slender, tapering,\r\n    irregular, often with a long, large, single shoulder, loose;\r\n    pedicel short with a few small warts; brush greenish. Berries\r\n    medium in size, round-oval, black, covered with bloom, drop badly;\r\n    skin thick, tough, adherent, contains much purplish-red pigment,\r\n    astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy, firm, stringy, foxy;\r\n    poor in quality. Seeds free, one to four, broad, dark brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXVIII.--Triumph (×3/5).]\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYES\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the Massachusetts Horticultural Society awarded a certificate\r\nof merit to Hayes for high quality in fruit. This brought it\r\nprominently before grape-growers and for a time it was popular, but\r\nwhen better known several defects became apparent. The vine is hardy\r\nand vigorous, but the growth is slow and the variety is a shy bearer.\r\nBoth bunches and berries are small, and the crop ripens at a time, a\r\nweek or ten days earlier than Concord, when there are many other good\r\ngreen grapes. Excellent though it is in quality, the variety is hardly\r\nworth a place in any vineyard. John B. Moore, Concord, Massachusetts,\r\nis the originator of Hayes. It is a seedling of Concord out of the\r\nsame lot of seedlings as Moore Early. It was first fruited in 1872.\r\n\r\n    Vine variable in vigor and productiveness, hardy and healthy.\r\n    Canes numerous, slender; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves uniform in\r\n    size; upper surface dark green; lower surface pubescent; lobes one\r\n    to three; teeth shallow, small. Flowers almost self-sterile, open\r\n    medium late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters variable in size and length,\r\n    often single-shouldered; pedicel long, slender; brush small, pale\r\n    green. Berries medium in size, round, greenish-yellow, covered\r\n    with thin bloom, persistent; skin thin, tender with a few small\r\n    reddish-brown dots; flesh fine-grained, tender, vinous, sweet at\r\n    the skin, agreeably tart at center, mild; good. Seeds few, of\r\n    average size, short, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEADLIGHT\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\nHeadlight is more desirable for southern than for northern vineyards,\r\nyet it is worthy of trial in the North. Its meritorious characters\r\nare: productiveness, outyielding Delaware, with which it competes;\r\ndisease-resistant foliage and vines; more than average vigor of vine;\r\nhigh quality of fruit, being almost the equal of Delaware in flavor\r\nand having tender, melting pulp which readily parts from the seeds;\r\nand earliness, ripening before Delaware and hanging on the vines or\r\nkeeping after being picked for some time without deterioration. The\r\noriginator of Headlight, T. V. Munson, states that the variety came\r\nfrom seed of Moyer fertilized by Brilliant. The seed was planted in\r\n1895 and the grape was introduced in 1901.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, very productive. Canes short, few in number,\r\n    slender, reddish-brown; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    continuous, short, bifid, very persistent. Leaves small, thick;\r\n    upper surface light green, dull, smooth; lower surface pale green,\r\n    pubescent; lobes one to three with terminus obtuse; petiolar sinus\r\n    intermediate in depth and width; basal sinus usually lacking;\r\n    lateral sinus shallow, narrow; teeth shallow. Flowers\r\n    self-sterile, open in mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters small, short, tapering,\r\n    frequently single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, slender,\r\n    covered with a few small warts; brush yellowish-brown. Berries\r\n    small, round, dark red with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    tough, adherent, astringent; flesh green, translucent, very juicy,\r\n    tender, fine-grained, vinous, sweet; very good. Seeds free, one to\r\n    three, small, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBEMONT\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\n_Bottsi, Brown French, Dunn, Herbemont's Madeira, Hunt, Kay's\r\nSeedling, McKee, Neal, Warren, Warrenton_\r\n\r\nIn the South, Herbemont holds the same rank as Concord in the North.\r\nThe vine is fastidious as to soil, requiring a well-drained warm soil,\r\nand one which is abundantly supplied with humus. Despite these\r\nlimitations, this variety is grown in an immense territory, extending\r\nfrom Virginia and Tennessee to the Gulf and westward through Texas.\r\nThe vine is remarkably vigorous, being hardly surpassed in this\r\ncharacter by any other of our native grapes. The fruits are\r\nattractive because of the large bunch and the glossy black of the\r\nsmall berries, and are borne abundantly and with certainty in suitable\r\nlocalities. The flesh characters of the fruit are good for a small\r\ngrape, neither flesh, skin nor seeds being objectionable in eating;\r\nthe pulp is tender, juicy, rich, sweet and highly flavored. The ample,\r\nlustrous green foliage makes this variety one of the attractive\r\nornamental plants of the South. Herbemont is known to have been in\r\ncultivation in Georgia before the Revolutionary War, when it was\r\ngenerally called Warren and Warrenton. In the early part of the last\r\ncentury, it came to the hands of Nicholas Herbemont, Columbia, South\r\nCarolina, whose name it eventually took.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous. Canes long, strong, bright green, with more or\r\n    less purple and heavy bloom; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, round, entire, or\r\n    three to seven-lobed, nearly glabrous above and below; upper\r\n    surface clear green; lower surface lighter green, glaucous.\r\n    Flowers self-fertile.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late. Clusters large, long, tapering, prominently\r\n    shouldered, compact; pedicels short with a few large warts; brush\r\n    pink. Berries round, small, uniform, reddish-black or brown with\r\n    abundant bloom; skin thin, tough; flesh tender, juicy; juice\r\n    colorless or slightly pink, sweet, sprightly. Seeds two to four,\r\n    small, reddish-brown, glossy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERBERT\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nIn all that constitutes a fine table-grape, Herbert (Plate XVIII) is\r\nas near perfection as any American variety. For a Vinifera-Labrusca\r\nhybrid, the vine is vigorous, hardy and fruitful, ranking in these\r\nrespects above many pure-bred Labruscas. While the fruit ripens with\r\nConcord, it keeps much later and packs and ships better. The variety\r\nis self-sterile and must be set near other varieties. Herbert is\r\ndeserving attention from commercial growers who supply a\r\ndiscriminating market, and its many good qualities give it high place\r\nas a garden grape. The variety is one of Rogers' hybrids, named\r\nHerbert in 1869.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, productive. Canes long, numerous, thick, dark\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, round; upper\r\n    surface dark green, dull, smooth; lower surface pale green with\r\n    some pubescence; leaf entire, terminus obtuse; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, narrow, closed, overlapping; basal and lateral sinuses\r\n    lacking; teeth shallow. Flowers self-sterile, open in mid-season;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, broad, tapering, two\r\n    to three clusters per shoot, heavily single-shouldered, loose;\r\n    pedicel thick with small russet warts; brush yellowish-green.\r\n    Berries large, round-oval, flattened, dull black, covered with\r\n    thick bloom, persistent, firm; skin thick, tough, adherent,\r\n    astringent; flesh light green, translucent, juicy, tender,\r\n    fine-grained; very good. Seeds adherent, three to six, large,\r\n    broad, notched, long with swollen neck, blunt, brown with yellow\r\n    tips.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERCULES\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nHercules is characterized by very large berries, fruit handsomely\r\ncolored and cluster large and well-formed. The flavor, while not of\r\nthe best, is good. Added to the desirable qualities of the fruit, the\r\nvines are hardy, vigorous and productive. These good characters,\r\nhowever, cannot make up for the several defects of the variety. The\r\ngrapes drop and crack badly and the pulp is tough and adheres too\r\nfirmly to the seed for a dessert grape, so that the variety is\r\nworthless except for breeding purposes. Hercules was introduced by G.\r\nA. Ensenberger, Bloomington, Illinois, about 1890; its parentage is\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, very productive. Canes long, dark\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long;\r\n    tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves large; upper surface light\r\n    green, glossy, smooth; lower surface grayish-green, pubescent;\r\n    lobes one to three, terminus acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow;\r\n    basal sinus usually absent; lateral sinus shallow; teeth shallow.\r\n    Flowers self-sterile, open in mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters very large, broad,\r\n    tapering, one to three clusters per shoot, compact; brush pale\r\n    green. Berries very large, round, black, glossy with heavy bloom,\r\n    firm; skin adherent, astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    very tough, coarse, stringy, foxy; fair in quality. Seeds\r\n    adherent, one to five, large, broad, deeply notched, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKS\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nHicks is a remarkably good grape and were it not that the fruit is\r\nalmost identical with that of Concord, ripening with it or a little\r\nearlier, it would have a place in the viticulture of the country.\r\nHowever, since it was introduced some years ago and has not found\r\ngreat favor with growers, it seems that it cannot make headway against\r\nConcord, with which it must compete. In many localities the vines are\r\nmore prolific than those of Concord and of stronger growth. Hicks was\r\nintroduced in 1898 by Henry Wallis, Wellston, Missouri, who states\r\nthat it is a chance seedling sent from California about 1870 to\r\nRichard Berry, a nurseryman of St. Louis County, Missouri.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, very productive. Canes medium to long,\r\n    numerous, reddish-brown, covered with thin bloom; tendrils\r\n    continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface\r\n    dark green, glossy; lower surface white, changing to a heavy\r\n    bronze, strongly pubescent. Flowers self-fertile, open early;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, long, broad,\r\n    tapering, often single-shouldered. Berries large, round,\r\n    purplish-black with heavy bloom, shatter when over-ripe, firm;\r\n    skin tender with dark wine-colored pigment; flesh green, juicy,\r\n    tough, fine-grained, faintly foxy; good. Seeds adherent, large,\r\n    short, broad, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIDALGO\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\nThe grapes of Hidalgo are rich, sweet, delicately flavored, and with\r\ncolor, size and form of berry and bunch so well combined as to make\r\nthe fruits singularly handsome. The skin is thin but firm and the\r\nvariety keeps and ships well. The vines, however, are doubtfully\r\nhardy, variable in vigor and not always fruitful. While Hidalgo may\r\nnot prove of value for the commercial vineyard, in favorable\r\nsituations it may give a supply of choice fruit for the amateur. The\r\nparentage of Hidalgo, as given by its originator, T. V. Munson, is\r\nDelaware, Goethe and Lindley. The variety was introduced by the\r\noriginator in 1902.\r\n\r\n    Vine variable in vigor, hardiness and productiveness. Canes thick,\r\n    dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils\r\n    intermittent or continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves large,\r\n    irregularly round, thick; upper surface light green, dull, rugose;\r\n    lower surface pale green, bronzed, heavily pubescent; lobes three\r\n    when present; petiolar sinus narrow, sometimes closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus wanting; lateral sinus shallow, narrow;\r\n    teeth very shallow, narrow. Flowers semi-fertile, open after\r\n    mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters large, long,\r\n    slender, cylindrical, often blunt, not shouldered, one to two\r\n    bunches per shoot, compact; pedicel long, slender with small\r\n    warts; brush yellowish-green with brown tinge. Berries large,\r\n    oval, greenish-yellow, glossy with thin bloom, persistent, firm;\r\n    skin thin, tough, adherent, astringent; flesh green, transparent,\r\n    juicy, tender, melting, aromatic, sweet; very good to best. Seeds\r\n    free, two to four, large, plump, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHLAND\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nFew varieties of black grapes equal Highland in appearance and quality\r\nof fruit. When given good care under favorable conditions, the bunches\r\nare unusually large and handsome in appearance, sometimes attaining a\r\nweight of two pounds, and bear beautiful bluish-black berries with the\r\nfine flavor and tender texture of Jura Muscat, one of its parents. The\r\nflesh is solid, firm and the fruit keeps and ships well. The vine is\r\nvigorous, productive to a fault but is doubtfully hardy. Where the\r\nclimate is temperate and the season long enough for the vine and\r\nfruit of Highland to develop, this is one of the choicest grapes for\r\nthe amateur. The variety originated about the close of the Civil War\r\nwith J. H. Ricketts, Newburgh, New York, from seed of Concord\r\nfertilized by Jura Muscat.\r\n\r\n    Vine variable in vigor, productive, healthy. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    dark brown with thin bloom; nodes enlarged; internodes long;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves large; upper\r\n    surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface grayish-green,\r\n    pubescent; lobes one to five, terminal one acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, variable in width; basal sinus shallow, narrow; lateral\r\n    sinus a notch; teeth deep, wide. Flowers self-fertile, open in\r\n    mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters large, long, broad, tapering,\r\n    usually single-shouldered, usually two bunches per shoot; pedicel\r\n    long, thick, smooth; brush green with yellow tinge. Berries large,\r\n    round-oval, purplish-black, dull with heavy bloom, persistent,\r\n    firm; skin tough, free; flesh green, translucent, juicy, tender,\r\n    vinous; good. Seeds free, one to six, large, long, notched, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOPKINS\r\n\r\n(Rotundifolia)\r\n\r\nHopkins is named by grape-growers in the South Atlantic states as the\r\nbest early Rotundifolia grape. Its season in North Carolina begins\r\nearly in August, nearly a month before any other. It is, also, one of\r\nthe best in quality and for quality and earliness should be in every\r\nhome vineyard in the region in which it grows. Hopkins was found near\r\nWilmington, North Carolina, about 1845, by John Hopkins.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, slender,\r\n    upright. Leaves of medium size, variable, cordate, longer than\r\n    broad, thick, leathery, smooth, dark green; margins sharply\r\n    serrate. Flowers self-fertile.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early. Clusters large, containing from four to ten\r\n    berries. Berries large, dark purple or almost black, round-oblong,\r\n    shelling badly; skin thick, tough, faintly marked with dots; pulp\r\n    white, tender, juicy with a sweet, pleasant flavor; one of the\r\n    best of the Rotundifolias in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOSFORD\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nHosford is an offspring of Concord, differing from the parent chiefly\r\nin the greater size of bunch and berry and in being less fruitful. The\r\nvariety is surpassed by Worden and Eaton, of the same type, and is\r\nprobably not worth cultivation. It is claimed by some that Hosford is\r\nidentical with Eaton but there are noticeable differences in both vine\r\nand fruit characters. The vine looks very like that of Concord except\r\nthat the indentations along the margins of the leaves are deeper.\r\nHosford originated in the garden of George Hosford, Ionia, Michigan,\r\nabout 1876, as a chance seedling growing between two Concord vines.\r\n\r\n    Vines lacking in vigor, hardy, unproductive. Canes short, few in\r\n    number, slender; nodes enlarged; internodes very short; tendrils\r\n    continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves medium in size; upper surface\r\n    light green, rugose; lower surface grayish-white to bronze,\r\n    heavily pubescent; lobes faint; petiolar sinus wide; teeth small,\r\n    sharp. Flowers shallow, semi-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, does not keep well. Clusters large, tapering,\r\n    slightly shouldered, compact; pedicel short with small warts;\r\n    brush slender, green. Berries large, round-oval, dull black with\r\n    abundant bloom, persistent; skin thick, tender; flesh pale green,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tender, vinous, sweet; good. Seeds few,\r\n    large, broad, blunt, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYBRID FRANC\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Rupestris)\r\n\r\nHybrid Franc is the best-known cross between Rupestris and Vinifera.\r\nIt is one of the few varieties used in Europe as a resistant stock now\r\nrecommended for a direct producer. The vines are hardy, vigorous and\r\nvery productive. The fruit is fit only for wine or grape-juice, being\r\ntoo acid to eat out of hand. The coloring matter in the fruit is very\r\nintense and might be used in giving color to grape products. The\r\nvariety is of French origin.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes numerous, thick, light\r\n    brown with blue bloom; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves small, thin; upper\r\n    surface light green, glossy, smooth; lower surface green, hairy\r\n    along ribs and large veins; lobes three to five with terminal one\r\n    acute; petiolar sinus narrow, sometimes closed and overlapping;\r\n    lateral sinus a notch. Flowers semi-fertile, open early; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, does not keep well. Clusters medium in size,\r\n    short, cylindrical, single-shouldered, compact; pedicel long,\r\n    slender with few small warts; brush short, wine-colored. Berries\r\n    small, oblate, black, glossy with thick bloom, persistent, firm;\r\n    skin thin, tender with very dark wine-colored pigment; flesh green\r\n    with reddish tinge, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tender,\r\n    spicy, tart; fair in quality. Seeds free, one to five, small,\r\n    short, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nIDEAL\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\nIdeal is a handsome seedling of Delaware, from which it differs\r\nchiefly in being larger in bunch and berry, attaining in both of these\r\ncharacters nearly the size of Catawba. In Kansas and Missouri, this\r\nvariety is highly recommended, not only for the high quality of the\r\nfruit, ranking with Delaware in quality, but because of vigorous,\r\nhealthy, productive vines. But farther north the vines are\r\nprecariously hardy and not sufficiently fruitful, healthy nor vigorous\r\nto warrant high recommendation. Ideal originated with John Burr,\r\nLeavenworth, Kansas, from seed of Delaware, about 1885.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, productive; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, bifid or trifid. Canes long, numerous, slender, dark\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long. Leaves large,\r\n    variable in color; lobes three to five; petiolar sinus deep, wide;\r\n    teeth deep, narrow; upper surface light green, dull; lower surface\r\n    pale green, pubescent.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, broad, heavily\r\n    shouldered; pedicel thick; brush green. Berries large, round,\r\n    dark red with thin bloom, usually persistent, firm; skin thick,\r\n    tough, adherent; flesh green, tender, aromatic, sweet next the\r\n    skin, acid at the center; good to very good. Seeds adherent,\r\n    large, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nIONA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nIn flavor, the fruit of Iona (Plate XIX) has a rare combination of\r\nsweetness and acidity, pure, delicate and vinous. The flesh is\r\ntransparent, melting, tender, juicy and of uniform consistency quite\r\nto the center. The seeds are few and small and part readily from the\r\nflesh. The color is a peculiar dark-red wine with a tint of amethyst,\r\nvariable and not always attractive. The bunch is large but loose, with\r\nberries varying in size and ripening unevenly. The fruit may be kept\r\nuntil late winter. The vine characters of Iona are not as good as\r\nthose of the fruit. To do well, the vine must have a soil exactly\r\nsuited to its wants, seemingly thriving best in deep, dry, sandy or\r\ngravelly clays. Iona responds especially well when trained against\r\nwalls or buildings, attaining under such conditions rare perfection.\r\nThe vines are doubtfully hardy and in many parts of the North must\r\nhave winter protection; they are not vigorous and are inclined to\r\noverbear, to remedy which they must have close pruning. In localities\r\nin which mildew and rot thrive, the variety is badly attacked by these\r\ndiseases. Iona originated with C. W. Grant, Iona Island, New York,\r\nfrom seed of Diana planted in 1885.\r\n\r\n    Vine weak, doubtfully hardy, unproductive. Canes short, light\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    bifid. Leaves thick; upper surface light green, dull, smooth;\r\n    lower surface grayish-green, heavily pubescent; lobes three to\r\n    five with terminal one acute; petiolar sinus of medium depth and\r\n    width; basal sinus shallow; lateral sinus shallow, wide; teeth\r\n    shallow. Flowers self-fertile, open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters medium in size, sometimes\r\n    double-shouldered, slender, tapering, loose; brush pale green.\r\n    Berries uniform, oval, round, dull, light and dark red with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent, firm; skin tough, adherent, slightly\r\n    astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tender,\r\n    melting, vinous; very good. Seeds free, one to four, small, broad,\r\n    plump, brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXIX.--Vergennes (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\nISABELLA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Alexander, Black Cape, Christie's Improved Isabella, Conckling's\r\nWilding, Constantia, Dorchester, Gibb's Grape, Hensell's Long Island,\r\nPayne's Early, Helene, Woodward_\r\n\r\nIsabella (Plate XX) is now of little more than historical interest, it\r\nhaving been one of the mainstays of American viticulture. In\r\nappearance, the fruit of Isabella is fully as attractive as that of\r\nany black grape, the clusters being large and well formed and the\r\nberries glossy black with thick bloom. The flavor is good, but the\r\nthick skin and muskiness in taste are objectionable. The grapes keep\r\nand ship well. Isabella is surpassed in vine characters by many other\r\nkinds, notably Concord, which has taken its place. The lustrous green,\r\nample foliage which remains late in the season, and the vigor of the\r\nvine, make this variety an attractive ornamental, well adapted for\r\ngrowing on arbors, porches and trellises. The origin of Isabella is\r\nnot known. It was obtained by William Prince, Flushing, Long Island,\r\nabout 1816 from Mrs. Isabella Gibbs, Brooklyn, New York.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes short, numerous with heavy\r\n    pubescence, thick, light brown; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes short; tendrils continuous, long, bifid or trifid.\r\n    Leaves thick; upper surface dark green, smooth, glossy; lower\r\n    surface whitish-green, heavily pubescent; lobes three when present\r\n    with terminal lobe obtuse; petiolar sinus shallow, narrow, often\r\n    closed, overlapping; basal sinus usually wanting; lateral sinus\r\n    shallow, narrow, frequently notched; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers\r\n    self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps and ships well. Clusters large, cylindrical,\r\n    frequently single-shouldered; pedicel slender, smooth; brush\r\n    long, yellowish-green. Berries medium to large, oval, black with\r\n    heavy bloom, persistent, soft; skin thick, tough, adherent,\r\n    astringent; flesh pale green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained,\r\n    tender, meaty, some foxiness, sweet; good. Seeds one to three,\r\n    large, broad, distinctly notched, short, brown with yellow tips.\r\n\r\n\r\nISABELLA SEEDLING\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nIsabella Seedling is an early, vigorous, productive offspring of\r\nIsabella. In fruit characters it greatly resembles its parent, but\r\nripens its crop earlier and has a more compact bunch. Like that of its\r\nparent, the fruit is of good quality and keeps remarkably well. This\r\nseedling is now grown more than Isabella and, while not of any\r\nconsiderable commercial importance, is far more deserving attention as\r\na market grape than some of the poorly flavored kinds more generally\r\ngrown. There are several varieties under this name. Two are mentioned\r\nby Warder; one of Ohio and one of New York origin. The Isabella\r\nSeedling here described originated with G. A. Ensenberger,\r\nBloomington, Illinois, in 1889.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, hardy, productive. Canes long, thick, dark\r\n    brown, often with a red tinge, with thin bloom; nodes prominent,\r\n    flattened; internodes long; tendrils intermittent or continuous,\r\n    bifid. Leaves healthy, large, thick; upper surface green, dull;\r\n    lower surface pale green or grayish-green, occasionally with a\r\n    tinge of bronze, pubescent. Flowers self-fertile; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters large, long, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, usually single-shouldered, loose, compact. Berries\r\n    large, oval, often pear-shaped, dull black with thick bloom,\r\n    persistent, soft; skin thick with some red pigment; flesh pale\r\n    green, juicy, tender, coarse, vinous; good. Seeds numerous, free,\r\n    large, broad, notched, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nISRAELLA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nIsraella came from C. W. Grant contemporaneously with Iona and was\r\nheralded as the earliest good grape in cultivation. For several years\r\nafter its introduction, it was widely tried but was almost everywhere\r\ndiscarded because of the poor quality and unattractive appearance of\r\nthe fruit and lack of vigor, hardiness and productiveness in the vine.\r\nGrant grew Israella from seed of Isabella planted in 1885.\r\n\r\n    Vine lacking in vigor, unproductive. Canes slender, dark brown;\r\n    nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short; tendrils continuous,\r\n    bifid. Leaves large; upper surface light green, dull, rugose;\r\n    lower surface pale green, pubescent; lobes one to five, faint;\r\n    petiolar sinus deep, narrow; teeth shallow, sharp; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters large, of medium length and\r\n    breadth, tapering, often single-shouldered, compact, frequently\r\n    with many abortive fruits. Berries of medium size, round-oval,\r\n    black or purplish-black with thin bloom, inclined to drop, soft;\r\n    skin thick, tough with a large amount of purplish-red pigment;\r\n    flesh pale green, juicy, stringy, mild, sweet from skin to center;\r\n    fair in quality. Seeds free, medium in size, notched, blunt, light\r\n    brown, often covered with grayish warts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIVES\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Æstivalis)\r\n\r\n_Ives' Madeira, Ives' Seedling, Kittredge_\r\n\r\nIves has a high reputation as a grape for making red wine, being\r\nsurpassed only by Norton for this purpose. The vine is hardy, healthy,\r\nvigorous and fruitful. The fruit is poor in quality, colors long\r\nbefore ripe, has a foxy odor, and the flesh is tough and pulpy. The\r\nbunches are compact, with well-formed, jet-black grapes, which make\r\nthem attractive. The vine is easily propagated and is adapted to any\r\ngood grape soil, but is so rampant in growth that it is difficult to\r\nmanage. The variety is not widely cultivated. Ives was grown by Henry\r\nIves from seed planted in 1840 in his garden in Cincinnati, Ohio.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes long, thick,\r\n    reddish-brown with thin bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes short; tendrils continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves\r\n    large; upper surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface pale\r\n    green, pubescent; lobes three to five when present with terminal\r\n    one acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, sometimes closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus shallow; lateral sinus narrow; teeth\r\n    shallow.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, tapering,\r\n    frequently single-shouldered, compact, often with numerous\r\n    abortive berries; pedicel slender with numerous small warts; brush\r\n    short, slender, pale with a reddish-brown tinge. Berries oval,\r\n    jet-black with heavy bloom, very persistent, firm; skin tough,\r\n    adherent, wine-colored pigment, astringent; flesh pale green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tough, foxy; good. Seeds\r\n    adherent, one to four, small, often abortive, broad, short, blunt,\r\n    plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMES\r\n\r\n(Rotundifolia)\r\n\r\nJames is one of the largest of the Rotundifolia grapes and probably\r\nthe best general-purpose variety of this species. The vine is noted\r\nfor vigor and productiveness. It cannot be grown north of Maryland. It\r\nthrives in sandy loam soils with clay subsoil. The variety was found\r\nby B. W. M. James, Pitt County, North Carolina. It was introduced\r\nabout 1890 and was placed on the grape list of the American\r\nPomological Society fruit catalog in 1899.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, productive. Canes slender, numerous, long,\r\n    slightly trailing. Leaves of medium size, thick, smooth, leathery,\r\n    cordate, as broad as long, with a serrate margin. Flowers open\r\n    late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens late, hangs on the vine for three weeks, keeps well.\r\n    Clusters small, containing from four to twelve berries, irregular,\r\n    loose. Berries large, three-fourths to one and one-fourth inches\r\n    in diameter, round, blue-black, marked with specks; skin thick,\r\n    tough. Pulp juicy, sweet; good in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nJANESVILLE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vulpina)\r\n\r\nEndowed with a constitution enabling it to withstand cold to which\r\nmost other grapes succumb, Janesville has made a place for itself in\r\nfar northern localities. Moreover, the grapes ripen early, being about\r\nthe first to color although they are not ripe until some time after\r\ncoloring. The vine also is healthy, vigorous and productive. The\r\nfruit, however, is worthless when better sorts can be grown. The\r\nclusters and berries are small, the grapes are pulpy, tough, seedy,\r\nhave a thick skin and a disagreeable acid taste. Janesville was grown\r\nby F. W. Loudon, Janesville, Wisconsin, from chance seed planted in\r\n1858.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes spiny, numerous,\r\n    dark brown; nodes flattened; internodes long; tendrils\r\n    intermittent or continuous, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves small,\r\n    thin; upper surface glossy, smooth; lower surface pale green,\r\n    lightly pubescent; leaf usually not lobed with terminus acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus narrow, often closed and overlapping; basal and\r\n    lateral sinuses lacking; teeth shallow. Flowers self-fertile, open\r\n    very early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters small, short, cylindrical,\r\n    usually single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, slender,\r\n    covered with small, scattering warts; brush dark wine color.\r\n    Berries round, dull black with heavy bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    thick, tough, adherent with dark wine-colored pigment, astringent;\r\n    flesh pale reddish-green, translucent, juicy, tough, coarse,\r\n    vinous, acid; fair in quality. Seeds adherent, one to six, large,\r\n    broad, angular, blunt, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEFFERSON\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nJefferson (Plate XXI) is an offspring of Concord crossed with Iona,\r\nand resembles Concord in vigor, productiveness and healthiness of\r\nvine, and Iona in color and quality of fruit. The vine produces its\r\nfruit two weeks later than Concord and is not as hardy, faults that\r\ndebar it from taking high rank as a commercial grape. Fortunately the\r\nvines yield readily to laying down for winter protection so that even\r\nin commercial plantations it is not difficult to prevent winter\r\ninjury. The bunches of Jefferson are large, well-formed, compact with\r\nberries of uniform size and color. The flesh is firm yet tender, juicy\r\nwith a rich, vinous flavor and a delicate aroma which persists even\r\nafter the berries have dried into raisins. The fruit ships and keeps\r\nwell, the berries adhering to the cluster and the fruit retaining its\r\nfreshness into late winter. Jefferson is widely distributed and is\r\nwell known by viticulturists in eastern America. It is not particular\r\nas to localities, if the season be long and the climate temperate, and\r\nthrives in all soils. The variety originated with J. H. Ricketts,\r\nNewburgh, New York; it fruited first in 1874.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, doubtfully hardy, productive. Canes short,\r\n    numerous, light to dark brown; nodes enlarged, round; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils intermittent, short, bifid or trifid. Leaves\r\n    healthy; upper surface light green, older leaves rugose; lower\r\n    surface pale green, strongly pubescent; leaf usually not lobed\r\n    with terminus acute; petiolar sinus narrow, sometimes closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus usually absent; lateral sinus shallow,\r\n    often a mere notch; teeth regular, shallow. Flowers self-fertile,\r\n    open late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps and ships well. Clusters large, cylindrical,\r\n    usually single-shouldered, sometimes double-shouldered, compact;\r\n    pedicel short, slender with a few inconspicuous warts; brush long,\r\n    slender, pale yellowish-green. Berries medium in size, oval, light\r\n    and dark red, glossy with thin bloom, persistent, very firm; skin\r\n    thick, tough, free, slightly astringent; flesh light green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, coarse-grained, tender, vinous; good to best.\r\n    Seeds free, one to four, broad, short, blunt, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nJESSICA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nJessica is an early, hardy, green grape. The fruit is sweet, rich,\r\nsprightly and almost free from foxiness, but is unattractive and does\r\nnot keep well. The clusters and berries are small, and the clusters\r\nare too loose for a good grape. Jessica may be commended for earliness\r\nand hardiness and is, therefore, desirable, if at all, in northern\r\nregions. William H. Read, Port Dalhousie, Ontario, grew Jessica from\r\nseed planted some time between 1870 and 1880.\r\n\r\n    Vine medium in vigor, healthy, hardy, productive. Canes long,\r\n    thick, dark brown with red tinge; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes short; tendrils continuous or intermittent, bifid or\r\n    trifid. Leaves small; upper surface dark green, glossy, often\r\n    rugose; lower surface pale green, very pubescent; lobes three;\r\n    petiolar sinus narrow; teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers\r\n    self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very early. Clusters small, slender, tapering, usually\r\n    single-shouldered. Berries small, round, light green, often tinged\r\n    with yellow, covered with thin bloom, persistent, soft; skin thin,\r\n    adherent, faintly astringent; flesh pale green, transparent,\r\n    juicy, tender, soft, sprightly, sweet; good. Seeds adherent,\r\n    medium to broad, notched, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nJEWEL\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe notable characters of Jewel are earliness and high quality in\r\nfruit; although, as compared with Delaware, its parent, the vine is\r\nvigorous, healthy and hardy. In form and size of bunch and berry,\r\nJewel closely resembles Delaware, but the grapes are deep black in\r\ncolor. The flesh characters and flavor of the fruit are much like\r\nthose of Delaware, the pulp being tender yet firm, and the flavor\r\nhaving the same rich, sprightly, vinous taste found in the parent. The\r\nseeds are few and small. The skin is thin but tough, and the grapes\r\nship well, keep long, do not shell, and although early, hang until\r\nfrost. Jewel is a most excellent grape, worthy the place among black\r\ngrapes that Delaware has among red varieties. In particular, it is\r\nrecommended for earliness and for localities in the North where\r\nstandard varieties do not ripen. John Burr, Leavenworth, Kansas, grew\r\nJewel from seed of Delaware planted about 1874.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, hardy, productive. Canes slender, light\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short;\r\n    tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves scant, thick; upper surface\r\n    light green, dull, rugose; lower surface tinged with bronze,\r\n    heavily pubescent; lobes three when present with terminus acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus narrow; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus\r\n    shallow, wide; teeth shallow. Flowers self-sterile, open in\r\n    mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early. Clusters small, slender, cylindrical,\r\n    single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, slender; brush short,\r\n    wine-colored. Berries medium in size, round, dark purplish-black,\r\n    dull with heavy bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin, tough,\r\n    adherent, wine-colored pigment; flesh pale green, translucent,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tender, sprightly, vinous, sweet; very good.\r\n    Seeds adherent, one to four, frequently one-sided, blunt, light\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nKENSINGTON\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Vulpina)\r\n\r\nKensington has several very meritorious fruit and vine characters. The\r\nvine resembles that of Clinton, its Vulpina parent, in vigor,\r\nhardiness, growth and productiveness, but the fruit has many of the\r\ncharacters of the European parent, Buckland Sweetwater. The grapes are\r\nyellowish-green, large, oval and borne in loose clusters of medium\r\nsize. In quality the fruit of Kensington is not equal to that of\r\nBuckland Sweetwater but is much better than that of Clinton. The flesh\r\nis tender and juicy with a rich, sweet, vinous flavor. The hardiness\r\nof the vine and the high quality of the fruit should make Kensington a\r\nfavorite green grape in northern gardens. This variety was grown by\r\nWilliam Saunders, London, Ontario. It was sent out some time between\r\n1870 and 1880.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, slender, light\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    persistent, intermittent or continuous, long, bifid or trifid.\r\n    Leaves thin; upper surface light green, glossy, smooth; lower\r\n    surface pale green, pubescent, hairy; lobes wanting or one to\r\n    three with terminus obtuse; petiolar sinus narrow; basal sinus\r\n    shallow when present; lateral sinus shallow, usually a notch;\r\n    teeth deep and wide. Flowers self-fertile, open early, stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season. Clusters large, cylindrical, often heavily\r\n    single-shouldered, loose, frequently with many undeveloped\r\n    berries; pedicel long and slender with small, inconspicuous warts;\r\n    brush short, pale green. Berries variable in size, oval,\r\n    yellowish-green, glossy with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    thin, tough, adherent, faintly astringent; flesh green,\r\n    transparent, juicy, tender, vinous, sweet; good. Seeds free, two\r\n    to four, wrinkled, large, long, broad, sharp-pointed,\r\n    yellowish-brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nKING\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nKing is similar to Concord, compared with which the vine is more\r\nvigorous and prolific, time of ripening and length of season the same,\r\nthe clusters are one-fourth larger, the grapes are more persistent,\r\nthe pulp is more tender, the flavor nearly the same but more\r\nsprightly, the seeds fewer in number, the wood harder and of shorter\r\njoints and the pedicels larger. King was found in the Concord vineyard\r\nof W. K. Munson, Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1892. The vine was set for\r\nConcord and is supposed to be a bud-sport of that variety.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes large, dark\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, slightly flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils continuous or intermittent, trifid or bifid.\r\n    Leaves unusually large, thick; upper surface green, dull; lower\r\n    surface grayish-white changing to slight bronze, pubescent; lobes\r\n    three when present, terminal one acute; teeth shallow, narrow.\r\n    Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, long, broad,\r\n    irregularly tapering, usually single-shouldered, compact. Berries\r\n    large, round, black with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin thick,\r\n    tough, adherent, astringent; flesh pale green, very juicy, tough,\r\n    stringy and with some foxiness; good. Seeds adherent, few, large,\r\n    short, broad, lightly notched if at all, blunt, plump, light\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe vine of Lady is much like that of Concord, its parent, although\r\nnot quite so vigorous nor productive, but ripens its fruit fully two\r\nweeks earlier. The fruit is much superior to that of Concord in\r\nquality, being richer, sweeter and less foxy. The grapes hang on the\r\nvines well but deteriorate rapidly after picking. The term,\r\n\"ironclad,\" used by grape-growers to express hardiness and freedom\r\nfrom disease, is probably as applicable to Lady as to any other of the\r\nLabrusca grapes. The foliage is dense and of a deep glossy green,\r\nneither scalding under a hot sun nor freezing until heavy frosts,\r\nmaking it an attractive ornament in the garden. Lady is deservedly\r\npopular as a grape for the amateur and should be planted for near-by\r\nmarkets. It succeeds wherever Concord is grown, and because of its\r\nearly ripening is especially adapted to northern latitudes where\r\nConcord does not always mature. Although the fruit ripens early, the\r\nbuds start late, often escaping late spring frosts. When Lady was\r\nfirst heard of, it was in the hands of a Mr. Imlay, Muskingum County,\r\nOhio. George W. Campbell, Delaware, Ohio, introduced it in 1874.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, medium in productiveness, healthy. Canes\r\n    short, slender, dark reddish-brown; nodes flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves medium in\r\n    size; upper surface light green, glossy, rugose; lower surface\r\n    pale green, pubescent; lobes one to five with terminal one\r\n    acuminate; petiolar sinus shallow, wide; lateral sinus variable in\r\n    depth and width; teeth shallow. Flowers self-fertile, open in\r\n    mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, does not keep well. Clusters small, short, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, compact; pedicel thick,\r\n    smooth; brush slender, long, greenish-white. Berries large, round,\r\n    light green, often with a tinge of yellow, glossy with thin bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin covered with small, scattering, dark dots,\r\n    thin, tender, adherent, astringent; flesh greenish-white,\r\n    translucent, juicy, tender, aromatic; very good. Seeds free, few,\r\n    broad, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nLady Washington is in many respects a most excellent grape but falls\r\nshort in quality and does not excel in vine characters. The grapes\r\nmake a good appearance, keep and ship well and are tender, juicy and\r\nsweet. The vines are luxuriant, hardy, for a grape with Vinifera\r\nblood, and healthy although slightly susceptible to mildew. As an\r\nexhibition grape, few green varieties show better when grown with care\r\nthan Lady Washington. In the West and Southwest, the variety is said\r\nto succeed better than any other Concord seedling. Lady Washington is\r\nanother of J. H. Ricketts' fine seedlings, this variety having come\r\nfrom seed of Concord fertilized by Allen's Hybrid. It was introduced\r\nin 1878.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, productive. Canes long, few, thick, dark brown;\r\n    nodes greatly enlarged, variable in shape; internodes long;\r\n    tendrils continuous, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thick;\r\n    upper surface dark green, older leaves strongly rugose, glossy;\r\n    lower surface pale green, pubescent; leaf entire with terminal\r\n    acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, frequently closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus usually wanting; lateral sinus shallow;\r\n    teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters large,\r\n    broad, irregularly cylindrical, single-shouldered, frequently\r\n    double-shouldered, loose; pedicel short with numerous conspicuous\r\n    warts; brush very short, greenish. Berries variable in size,\r\n    round-oblate, yellow-amber, glossy with thin bloom, persistent;\r\n    skin thin, tender, adherent; flesh pale green, transparent, juicy\r\n    and tender, stringy, aromatic, sweet; very good. Seeds free, one\r\n    to four, broad, brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXX.--Winchell (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\nLENOIR\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\n_Alabama, Black El Paso, Black July, Black Spanish, Blue French,\r\nBurgundy, Cigar Box Grape, Devereaux, Jack, Jacques, July Sherry,\r\nLongworth's Ohio, MacCandless, Ohio, Springstein, Warren_\r\n\r\nLenoir is a tender southern grape which has been used largely in\r\nFrance and California as a resistant stock and a direct producer. The\r\nfruit is highly valued for its dark red wine and is very good for\r\ntable use. The vine is very resistant to phylloxera and withstands\r\ndrouth well. The origin of Lenoir is unknown. It was in cultivation in\r\nthe South as long ago as the early part of the last century. Nicholas\r\nHerbemont states in 1829 that its name was given from a man named\r\nLenoir who cultivated it near Stateburg, South Carolina.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, thrifty, semi-hardy, productive. Canes numerous,\r\n    with some bloom at the nodes; tendrils intermittent. Leaves from\r\n    two to seven-lobed, usually five, with characteristic bluish-green\r\n    color above and pale green below.\r\n\r\n    Clusters variable, medium to very large, tapering, usually\r\n    shouldered. Berries small, round, dark bluish-purple, nearly black\r\n    with lilac bloom; skin thick, tough; flesh juicy, tender, sweet,\r\n    very rich in coloring matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGNAN BLANC\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_White July, Luglienga, Joannenc_\r\n\r\nAt Geneva, New York, Lignan Blanc ripens first of all grapes, native\r\nor European. It is not of highest quality but is better than any other\r\nearly grape and makes a valuable addition to the home vineyard. It is\r\na favorite grape in Europe and is rather commonly grown in California.\r\nThis variety offers excellent material for hybridization with native\r\ngrapes.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, medium productive; buds open early; opening leaves\r\n    light green, glossy, tinged with red along the edges, thinly\r\n    pubescent. Leaves medium in size, roundish, somewhat dull green,\r\n    slightly rugose; lower surface glabrous; blade thick; lobes\r\n    usually five though sometimes three; petiolar sinus medium in\r\n    depth, wide; lower lateral sinus medium in depth, narrow; upper\r\n    lateral sinus shallow, narrow; margin dentate; teeth long, narrow.\r\n    Flowers appear early for a Vinifera; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens the first of September and is a good keeper; clusters\r\n    above medium in size, tapering, medium compact; berries medium to\r\n    large, oval, yellowish-green, with thin bloom; skin thin, tender,\r\n    neutral; flesh greenish-white, firm, juicy, meaty, sweet; quality\r\n    good.\r\n\r\n\r\nLINDLEY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nBy common consent, Lindley (Plate XXII) is the best of the red grapes\r\noriginated by Rogers in his crosses between Labrusca and Vinifera. The\r\nbunches are of only medium size and are loose, but the berries are\r\nwell-formed, of uniform size and an attractive dark red color. The\r\nflesh is firm, fine-grained, juicy, tender with a peculiarly rich\r\naromatic flavor. The skin is thick and tough but is not objectionable\r\nin fruit fully ripe. The fruit keeps and ships well, and the berries\r\nneither crack nor shatter. The vine is vigorous, hardy for a Vinifera\r\nhybrid, healthy but, as with most of its kind, susceptible to mildew.\r\nThe chief defects of Lindley are self-sterility, precariousness in\r\nbearing and lack of adaptation to many soils. Lindley is a general\r\nfavorite in the garden. In 1869 Rogers gave this grape its name in\r\nhonor of John Lindley, the English botanist.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, usually hardy, susceptible to mildew. Canes very\r\n    long, dark reddish-brown with thin bloom; nodes enlarged, usually\r\n    flattened; internodes long, thick; tendrils continuous, long,\r\n    bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface light green,\r\n    dull, slightly rugose; lower surface grayish-white, pubescent;\r\n    obscurely three-lobed with terminus acute; petiolar sinus deep,\r\n    narrow, often closed and overlapping; teeth shallow. Flowers\r\n    self-sterile, open in mid-season; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters long, broad,\r\n    cylindrical, frequently single-shouldered, the shoulder being\r\n    connected to the bunch by a long stem, loose; pedicel short,\r\n    slender, smooth; brush short, pale green. Berries large,\r\n    round-oval, dark-red with faint bloom; skin tough, adherent,\r\n    unpigmented, strongly astringent; flesh pale green, translucent,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tender, vinous; good to best. Seeds adherent,\r\n    two to five, notched, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUCILE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nIn vigor, health, hardiness and productiveness, Lucile (Plate XXII) is\r\nnot surpassed by any native grape. Unfortunately, the fruit characters\r\nare not so desirable. The size, form and color of bunches and berries\r\nare good, making a very attractive fruit, but the grapes have an\r\nobnoxious, foxy taste and odor and are pulpy and seedy. Lucile is\r\nearlier than Concord, the crop ripening with that of Worden or\r\npreceding it a few days. For an early variety, the fruit keeps well\r\nand in spite of thin skin ships well. The vine thrives in all grape\r\nsoils. Lucile may be recommended where a hardy grape is desired and\r\nfor localities in which the season is short. J. A. Putnam, Fredonia,\r\nNew York, grew Lucile. The vine fruited first in 1890. It is a\r\nseedling of Wyoming, which it resembles in fruit and vine and\r\nsurpasses in both.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, very productive. Canes long, light brown;\r\n    nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short; tendrils continuous,\r\n    bifid or trifid. Leaves large, firm; upper surface light green,\r\n    glossy, smooth; lower surface pale green, pubescent; leaf with\r\n    terminus acute; petiolar sinus shallow, narrow, sometimes closed\r\n    and overlapping; basal sinus usually absent; lateral sinus a notch\r\n    when present; teeth shallow. Flowers self-fertile, open early;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters large, long, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, usually single-shouldered, very compact; pedicel\r\n    short, thick with few, small, inconspicuous warts; brush light\r\n    brown. Berries large, round, dark red with thin bloom, persistent,\r\n    firm; skin thin, tender, astringent; flesh pale green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, tough, stringy, foxy; fair in quality. Seeds\r\n    adherent, one to four, small, broad, short, blunt, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUTIE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nLutie (Plate XXIII) is chiefly valuable for its vine characters. The\r\nvines are vigorous, hardy, healthy and fruitful, although scarcely\r\nequaling Lucile in any of these characters. Pomologists differ widely\r\nas to the merits of the fruit, some claiming high quality for it and\r\nothers declaring that it is no better than a wild Labrusca. The\r\ndifference of opinion is due to a peculiarity of the fruit; if eaten\r\nfresh, the quality, while far from being of the best, is not bad, but\r\nafter being picked for several days it develops so much foxiness of\r\nflavor and aroma that it is scarcely edible. Lutie is a seedling found\r\nby L. C. Chisholm, Spring Hill, Tennessee. It was introduced in 1885.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes short, slender,\r\n    dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    continuous, short, bifid. Leaves medium in size; upper surface\r\n    dark green, rugose; lower surface bronze or whitish-green,\r\n    pubescent; leaf usually not lobed with terminus acute; petiolar\r\n    sinus deep, wide; basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus shallow and\r\n    narrow when present; teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers self-fertile,\r\n    early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, does not keep well. Clusters medium in size, short,\r\n    broad, blunt, cylindrical, usually not shouldered, compact;\r\n    pedicel short with small, scattering warts; brush slender, pale\r\n    green. Berries large, round, dark red, dull with thin bloom, drop\r\n    badly from pedicel, firm; skin tender, adherent, astringent; flesh\r\n    pale green, translucent, juicy, tough, foxy; fair in quality.\r\n    Seeds adherent, one to four, large, broad, short and blunt, dark\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALAGA\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nMalaga is one of the favorite table-grapes in California and also a\r\npopular grape to ship to eastern markets. In some parts of southern\r\nCalifornia, where the Muscats do not thrive, it is much grown, and in\r\nthe San Joaquin Valley it is rather largely used in making raisins. It\r\nrequires a long season and probably could not be grown in eastern\r\nregions except in the most favored localities. The description is\r\ncompiled.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, healthy and productive; wood reddish-brown,\r\n    short-jointed. Leaves of medium size, smooth, leathery; light\r\n    glossy green above, lighter below; deeply lobed. Bunches very\r\n    large, long, loose, shouldered, sometimes scraggly; stem long and\r\n    flexible; berries very large, oval, yellowish-green, covered with\r\n    light bloom; skin thick; flesh firm, crisp, sweet and rich;\r\n    quality good. Season late, keeps and ships well.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcPIKE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nMcPike is noteworthy because of the large size of the berries and\r\nbunches. It is very similar to its parent, Worden, differing in\r\nhaving fewer but larger berries, grapes not as high in flavor and\r\nfewer and smaller seeds. Because of the thin, tender skin, the berries\r\ncrack badly. The grapes shell more or less, and the vines are less\r\nproductive than those of Worden. The faults named debar it from\r\nbecoming a commercial grape and it is not high enough in quality to\r\nmake it of value for the amateur. This variety originated with H. G.\r\nMcPike, Alton, Illinois, from seed of Worden planted in 1890.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, very productive. Canes of medium length,\r\n    dull reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes very\r\n    short; tendrils continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thick;\r\n    upper surface light green, dull, rugose; lower surface\r\n    grayish-white, heavily pubescent; leaf entire with terminus acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus deep; basal and lateral sinuses lacking. Flowers\r\n    nearly self-fertile.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters variable in size, broad,\r\n    irregularly tapering, usually not shouldered; pedicel long, thick,\r\n    smooth; brush long, slender, green with brown tinge. Berries\r\n    unusually large, round, purplish-black with heavy bloom, firm;\r\n    skin cracks, adherent to pulp, astringent; flesh pale green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, tender, stringy, vinous; fair to good. Seeds\r\n    adherent, one to four, short, broad, blunt, plump, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARION\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Black German, Marion Port_\r\n\r\nMarion so closely resembles Clinton in botanical and horticultural\r\ncharacters as to be clearly of the same type. The vine is vigorous and\r\nhardy, but hardly sufficiently productive, and is susceptible to\r\nmildew and leaf-hoppers. The fruit is pleasantly sweet and spicy,\r\nalthough not high enough in quality for a table-grape, but makes a\r\nvery good dark red wine. The fruit colors early but ripens late, hangs\r\nwell on the vines and improves with a touch of frost. Marion was\r\nbrought to notice by a Mr. Shepherd, Marion, Ohio, about 1850.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes very long, dark\r\n    reddish-brown, covered with bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes very long; tendrils continuous, sometimes intermittent,\r\n    long, bifid. Leaves very large; upper surface dark green, glossy;\r\n    lower surface pale green, smooth; leaf entire, terminus acuminate;\r\n    petiolar sinus very deep, narrow, often closed and overlapping;\r\n    basal and lateral sinuses usually lacking; teeth shallow, wide.\r\n    Flowers self-sterile, open very early; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters medium in size, short,\r\n    slender, cylindrical, single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    slender with a few inconspicuous warts; brush very short,\r\n    wine-colored. Berries small, round, black, glossy with heavy\r\n    bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin, tough, adherent with much\r\n    wine-colored pigment, astringent; flesh dark green, translucent,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tough, sprightly, spicy, tart; fair in\r\n    quality. Seeds adherent, one to five, medium in size, broad,\r\n    short, very plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARTHA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nMartha was at one time a popular green grape, but the introduction of\r\nsuperior varieties has reduced its popularity until now it is but\r\nlittle grown. It is a seedling of Concord and resembles its parent,\r\ndiffering chiefly as follows: fruit green, a week earlier, bunch and\r\nberry smaller, flavor far better, being sweeter, more delicate and\r\nless foxy. The vine of Martha is a lighter shade of green, is less\r\nrobust, and the blossoms open a few days earlier than those of\r\nConcord. One of the defects of Martha, and the chief cause of its\r\ngoing out of favor, is that it does not keep nor ship well. The\r\nvariety is still being planted in the South but is generally abandoned\r\nin the North. Samuel Miller, Calmdale, Pennsylvania, grew Martha from\r\nseed of Concord; it was introduced about 1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine hardy, productive, susceptible to attacks of mildew. Canes\r\n    long, dark reddish-brown, surface with thin bloom, roughened;\r\n    nodes enlarged, slightly flattened; tendrils continuous, or\r\n    intermittent, bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface light\r\n    green; lower surface light bronze, heavily pubescent; lobes\r\n    wanting or faint; petiolar sinus shallow, very wide; teeth\r\n    irregular. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season. Clusters medium in size, tapering,\r\n    single-shouldered, loose; pedicel short, slender; brush very\r\n    short, green. Berries medium in size, round, light green with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent; skin thin, very tender, adherent; flesh pale\r\n    green, juicy, tough, fine-grained, slightly foxy; very good. Seeds\r\n    few in number, adherent, broad, blunt, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMASSASOIT\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nMassasoit is distinguished as the earliest of Rogers' hybrids,\r\nripening with Delaware. The grapes have the peculiarity of being best\r\nbefore full maturity, developing, after ripening, a degree of foxiness\r\nwhich impairs the quality. In shape and size of berry and bunch, there\r\nis a striking resemblance to Isabella, but the color is that of\r\nCatawba. The texture of the fruit is especially good, firm but tender\r\nand juicy, while the flavor is rich and sweet. The vine is vigorous,\r\nhardy and productive but subject to mildew and rot. Massasoit is worth\r\na place in the home vineyard and as an early grape of fine quality for\r\nlocal markets.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, very productive, subject to rot and\r\n    mildew. Canes long, thick, dark brown with reddish tinge; nodes\r\n    enlarged, flattened; tendrils continuous, long, trifid or bifid.\r\n    Leaves variable in size; upper surface light green, dull, smooth;\r\n    lower surface pale green, pubescent; lobes three to five with\r\n    terminus acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow; basal sinus shallow,\r\n    narrow, obscure; teeth shallow. Flowers self-sterile, open late;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters variable in size, broad,\r\n    cylindrical, frequently single-shouldered; pedicel slender with a\r\n    few indistinct warts; brush pale green. Berries large, round-oval,\r\n    dark brownish-red, dull with thin bloom, very persistent, firm;\r\n    skin thin, tender, adherent, astringent; flesh pale green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, fine-grained, soft, stringy, foxy; good to\r\n    very good. Seeds adherent, one to five, large, broad, distinctly\r\n    notched, plump, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAXATAWNEY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nWhile at one time very popular, grape-growers now seldom hear of\r\nMaxatawney. It is a southern grape, ripening its fruit in the North\r\nonly occasionally. The variety is interesting historically as being\r\nthe first good green grape and as showing unmistakable Vinifera\r\ncharacters, another example of the fortuitous hybridization which gave\r\nso many valuable varieties before artificial hybridization of Vinifera\r\nwith native grapes had been tried. In 1843, a man living in\r\nEagleville, Pennsylvania, received several bunches of grapes from\r\nMaxatawney. The seeds of these grapes were planted and one grew, the\r\nresulting plant being the original vine of Maxatawney.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, variable in productiveness. Canes\r\n    medium in length, slender, reddish; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes short; tendrils continuous, bifid. Leaves large, dark\r\n    green, thick; lower surface grayish-white with tinge of bronze,\r\n    heavily pubescent; lobes three to five; petiolar sinus narrow;\r\n    teeth shallow. Flowers self-sterile, open in mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters small to medium, short, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, occasionally with a small, single shoulder, compact;\r\n    pedicel long, slender, warty; brush long, yellow. Berries variable\r\n    in size, oval, pale red or dull green with amber tinge, with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent; skin tough, astringent; flesh tender, foxy;\r\n    good to very good. Seeds free, few, large, very broad, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORY\r\n\r\n(Rotundifolia)\r\n\r\nMemory is one of the best of the Rotundifolia grapes for the garden\r\nand local markets, its fruits being especially good for dessert. As\r\nyet, however, the variety has not been widely distributed even in\r\nNorth Carolina where it originated. The vine is given credit for being\r\nthe most vigorous grower and the most productive of the grapes of its\r\nspecies. Memory is probably a seedling of Thomas, which it much\r\nresembles, having been found in a vineyard of Thomas grapes near\r\nWhiteville, North Carolina, by T. S. Memory, about 1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, healthy, productive. Leaves large, longer than\r\n    broad, thick, smooth with coarsely serrate margins. Flowers\r\n    perfect.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens in September in North Carolina; clusters large, with\r\n    from four to twelve berries which hang unusually well for a\r\n    variety of V. Rotundifolia. Berries very large, round-oblong, deep\r\n    brownish-black, almost jet black; skin thick; flesh tender, juicy,\r\n    sweet; good to best.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERRIMAC\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nMerrimac is often accredited as the best black grape among Rogers'\r\nhybrids, but an analysis of the characters of the several black\r\nvarieties grown by Rogers shows that it is surpassed by Wilder,\r\nHerbert and possibly Barry. The vine is strong in growth, productive,\r\nhardy and exempt from fungal diseases; but the grapes are not high in\r\nquality, and flesh, skin and seed characters are such that the fruit\r\nis not as pleasant to eat as the other black varieties named. Merrimac\r\nis worthy a place in collections for the sake of variety. Rogers gave\r\nthis variety the name Merrimac in 1869.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, usually hardy, productive. Canes slender, dark\r\n    brown, surface roughened; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    short; tendrils intermittent, short, bifid. Leaves large, thin;\r\n    upper surface very light green, glossy, smooth; lower surface pale\r\n    green, pubescent and cobwebby; lobes three with terminal one\r\n    obtuse; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, sometimes closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus usually lacking; lateral sinus shallow,\r\n    narrow; teeth shallow. Flowers self-sterile, open in mid-season;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters variable in size,\r\n    broad, tapering; pedicel slender, covered with numerous\r\n    inconspicuous warts; brush wine-colored. Berries large, round,\r\n    black, glossy with abundant bloom, persistent, firm; skin thick,\r\n    tough, adherent, astringent; flesh light green, translucent,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tender, stringy; good. Seeds adherent, one to\r\n    five, broad, long, with enlarged neck, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILLS\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe bunches and berries of Mills are large and well-formed; the\r\nberries are firm and solid, with the skin adherent as in Viniferas;\r\nthe flesh is juicy and parts readily from the seeds; the flavor is\r\nrich, sweet and vinous; and the grapes are hardly surpassed in keeping\r\nquality. But when the fruit characters of Mills have been praised,\r\nnothing further can be said in its favor. The vines are neither\r\nvigorous, hardy nor fruitful and are very subject to mildew; neither\r\nwood nor roots ripen well in the North in average seasons; and the\r\nvariety is a most difficult one for nurserymen to grow. Mills is of\r\ndoubtful commercial value, but for the garden it is possible that the\r\ngrower may be able to graft it to advantage on some variety with\r\nbetter vine characters. William H. Mills, Hamilton, Ontario, grew\r\nMills about 1870 from seed of Muscat Hamburg fertilized by Creveling.\r\n\r\n    Vine medium in vigor, hardiness and productiveness. Canes long,\r\n    thick, light brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thick; upper surface\r\n    dark green, dull, rugose; lower surface pale green, cobwebby;\r\n    lobes three to five with terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    intermediate in depth and width; basal and lateral sinuses deep\r\n    and wide; teeth deep. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, long, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, often double-shouldered, compact; pedicel slender\r\n    with numerous, small warts; brush long, wine-colored. Berries\r\n    large, oval, jet-black with abundant bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    thick, tough, adherent; flesh light green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    rich, tender, sprightly, vinous, sweet; very good to best. Seeds\r\n    free, one to three, large, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISH\r\n\r\n(Rotundifolia)\r\n\r\nMish is a favorite Rotundifolia in North Carolina, being planted\r\nextensively in some parts of that state. Its outstanding characters\r\nare vigor and productiveness in vine and high quality in the fruit.\r\nMish is named by many as the best all-round Rotundifolia, being of\r\nvalue for dessert, wine and grape-juice. The variety was found by W.\r\nM. Mish, about 1846, near Washington, North Carolina.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, productive, healthy, open in growth; canes\r\n    somewhat trailing. Leaves large, round, thick, smooth, leathery\r\n    with coarsely dentate margin. Flowers perfect.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, does not ripen uniformly, keeps and ships well.\r\n    Clusters of medium size with from six to fifteen berries which\r\n    cling well to the pedicel. Berries of medium size, round-oval,\r\n    deep reddish-black with numerous conspicuous dots; skin thin,\r\n    cracking in wet weather; flesh tender, juicy, sweet, exceptionally\r\n    well flavored; very good to best.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSION\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nOf all grapes, Mission has probably played the most important part in\r\nthe vineyards of California. Grown from the earliest times at the old\r\nmissions, its source or its name has never been determined. Its\r\nviticultural value for table and wine-press was early appreciated by\r\nCalifornia grape-growers, and its culture rapidly spread to every\r\ncounty in the state adapted to grape-growing. With vines vigorous,\r\nhealthy and productive, bearing grapes of delicious quality, Mission\r\nis a mainstay on the Pacific slope, surpassed by few vineyard\r\nvarieties for general usefulness. The description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, productive; wood short-jointed,\r\n    grayish-brown, dull, dark. Leaf medium to large, slightly oblong,\r\n    with large, deeply-cut compound teeth; basal sinus widely opened,\r\n    primary sinuses narrow and shallow; smooth on both sides with\r\n    scattered tomentum below, bright green above, lighter below. Bunch\r\n    divided into many small, distinct lateral clusters, shouldered,\r\n    loose, sometimes very loose; berries of medium size, purple or\r\n    almost black with heavy bloom; skin thin; flesh firm, crisp,\r\n    juicy, sweet, rich and delicious. Seeds rather large and\r\n    prominent; season late.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSOURI RIESLING\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nMissouri Riesling attains perfection only in the South. The vines are\r\nhardy, vigorous, productive and healthy in the North, as a rule, but\r\nthe fruit is lacking in quality. In the South, Missouri Riesling is a\r\nbeautiful fruit when well grown and has many good qualities of fruit\r\nand vine. It originated with Nicholas Grein, Hermann, Missouri, about\r\n1870, probably from seed of Taylor.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes very long, numerous,\r\n    thick, dark brown; nodes enlarged; internodes long; tendrils\r\n    continuous, long, trifid or bifid. Leaves large, thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, glossy, smooth; lower surface pale green,\r\n    thinly pubescent; lobes five with terminal one acuminate; petiolar\r\n    sinus deep, narrow; basal sinus shallow, wide; lateral sinus deep,\r\n    wide; teeth deep, wide. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, does not keep nor ship well. Clusters short,\r\n    cylindrical, single-shouldered; pedicel long with few small warts;\r\n    brush green. Berries of medium size, round, yellowish-green\r\n    changing to light red with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    sprinkled with small brown dots, thin, tough, adherent,\r\n    astringent; flesh pale green, translucent, juicy, tender,\r\n    fine-grained, lacking in aroma, mild; fair in quality. Seeds\r\n    adherent, one to four, surface rough, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTEFIORE\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nMontefiore is extensively grown in Missouri and the Southwest but is\r\nalmost unknown in the North and East. It is reported as succeeding in\r\nthe Lake District of Ohio and, with the exception that it is uncertain\r\nin bearing and not always productive, it grows well in sections of New\r\nYork. While it is essentially a wine-grape, yet it is pleasing in\r\ntaste and texture of fruit and is far better in quality than many of\r\nthe coarser Labruscas commonly cultivated. It keeps and ships well\r\nand presents an attractive appearance. Jacob Rommel, Morrison,\r\nMissouri, grew this variety about 1875 from seed of Taylor fertilized\r\nby Ives.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous and hardy. Canes long, thick, dark brown with thin\r\n    bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long; tendrils\r\n    continuous, long, bifid. Leaves thick; upper surface light green,\r\n    dull, smooth; lower surface grayish-white, pubescent; lobes three\r\n    when present with terminus acute; petiolar sinus wide; basal sinus\r\n    lacking; lateral sinus shallow when present; teeth deep. Flowers\r\n    semi-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters small, short, tapering,\r\n    single-shouldered, the shoulder being connected to the bunch by a\r\n    long stem, compact; pedicel short, slender, smooth; brush red.\r\n    Berries small, oval, often compressed, black, glossy with abundant\r\n    bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin, tough, adherent, astringent;\r\n    flesh green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tender, melting,\r\n    vinous, sweet; fair to good. Seeds free, one to five, small,\r\n    broad, faintly notched, short, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE EARLY\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nMoore Early (Plate XXIV) is the standard grape of its season. Its\r\nfruit cannot be described better than as an early Concord. The vines\r\nare readily distinguishable from those of Concord, differing chiefly\r\nin being less productive. To grow the variety satisfactorily, the soil\r\nmust be rich, well-drained and loose, must be frequently cultivated,\r\nand the vines should be pruned severely. The bunches of Moore Early\r\nare not as large as those of Concord and are less compact; the berries\r\nshell rather more easily, and the skin cracks more readily. The flesh\r\ncharacters and the flavor are essentially those of Concord, although\r\nthe quality is not as high as in the older variety. The quality is,\r\nhowever, much higher than that of Champion and Hartford, its chief\r\ncompetitors, and varieties which it should replace. Moore Early is by\r\nno means an ideal grape for its season, but until something better is\r\nintroduced it will probably remain the best early commercial sort.\r\nCaptain John B. Moore, Concord, Massachusetts, originated this\r\nvariety from seed of Concord, planted about 1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, unproductive. Canes short, dark\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short;\r\n    tendrils continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thick; upper\r\n    surface dark green, dull; lower surface tinged with bronze,\r\n    heavily pubescent; leaf usually not lobed, terminus acute;\r\n    petiolar sinus wide; basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus a notch\r\n    when present; teeth shallow, narrow. Flowers fertile, open in\r\n    mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, does not keep well. Clusters medium in size, length,\r\n    and breadth, cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, loose;\r\n    pedicel short, thick, smooth; brush short, pale green. Berries\r\n    large, round, purplish-black, firm; skin tender, adherent; flesh\r\n    green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tough with slight\r\n    foxiness; fair to good. Seeds one to four, large, broad, plump,\r\n    blunt, brown with yellow tinge at tips.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSCATELLO\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Moscatello Nero. Black Muscat_\r\n\r\nBeautiful in appearance and having a delicate Muscat taste and aroma,\r\nthis variety is one of the good table-grapes of the Pacific slope.\r\nUnfortunately it ripens so late that it is hardly worth trying in the\r\nEast. The variety has the reputation of being very productive. The\r\ndescription is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, very productive. Leaves of medium size,\r\n    with deep upper and shallow lower sinuses; glabrous above,\r\n    slightly downy below, very hairy on the veins, with long, sharp\r\n    teeth. Bunch large to very large, long, loose, conico-cylindrical,\r\n    winged; berries very large, borne on long slender pedicels, dark\r\n    purple, almost black; skin thin but tough; flesh rather soft,\r\n    juicy; flavor sweet, rich, aromatic, musky; quality very good.\r\n    Season late, does not keep well.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOYER\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\n_Jordan, Moyer's Early Red_\r\n\r\nMoyer is almost a counterpart of its parent, Delaware. Were it not\r\nthat the variety is from one to two weeks earlier than Delaware, and\r\nsomewhat hardier, hence better adapted for cold regions, it could have\r\nno place in viticulture. Compared with Delaware, the vine is hardly as\r\nvigorous and is less productive, but is freer from rot and mildew. The\r\nbunches are much like those of Delaware but have the fault of setting\r\nfruit imperfectly even when cross-pollination is assured; the berries\r\nare a little larger, of much the same color and of like flavor, rich,\r\nsweet, with pure vinousness and without a trace of foxiness. The fruit\r\nkeeps well, ships well and does not crack nor shell. Moyer is well\r\nestablished in Canada, proving perfectly hardy wherever Concord is\r\ngrown, possibly standing even more cold. W. H. Read, Port Dalhousie,\r\nOntario, raised the original vine of Moyer, about 1880, from seed of\r\nDelaware fertilized by Miller's Burgundy.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, unproductive. Canes numerous,\r\n    slender, dull, dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened;\r\n    internodes short; tendrils continuous, long, bifid or trifid.\r\n    Leaves small; upper surface dark green, dull, smooth; lower\r\n    surface pale green or with faint blue tinge, heavily pubescent;\r\n    lobes two to five with terminus acute; petiolar sinus shallow;\r\n    basal sinus shallow when present; lateral sinus shallow, narrow;\r\n    teeth very shallow, narrow. Flowers self-sterile, open early;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well but loses color if kept too long. Clusters\r\n    small, short, slender, tapering, sometimes single-shouldered;\r\n    pedicel short with small warts; brush yellowish-green. Berries\r\n    small, oblate, dark red with faint bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    tough, free, astringent; flesh translucent, juicy, tender,\r\n    fine-grained, vinous; good to very good. Seeds free, one to four,\r\n    broad, short, very blunt, brown with yellow tinge at tips.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCATEL\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_White Frontignan_\r\n\r\nThis old and standard sort is rather commonly grown in some of the\r\ngrape regions of California to follow Chasselas Golden. It might be\r\ntried with some show of success in favored grape regions in the East.\r\nThe description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Vine of medium size, vigorous, healthy; canes strong, spreading,\r\n    reddish-brown with short internodes. Leaves of medium size, thin,\r\n    five-lobed; glabrous except on the lower sides of the well-marked\r\n    ribs where a few hairs show. Bunches long, cylindrical, regular,\r\n    compact; berries round, golden-yellow becoming amber; flavor\r\n    sweet, rich, aromatic, peculiar; quality very good. Season late\r\n    mid-season, keeps and ships well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXI.--Worden (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCAT HAMBURG\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nMuscat Hamburg (Plate XXV) is an old European grape well known in some\r\nparts of America in greenhouse graperies, since it is one of the best\r\nfor forcing. All who know the beautiful fruits of this variety grown\r\nin forcing-houses will want to test it out of doors, where at the\r\nGeneva, New York, Experiment Station, they have done well, many\r\nclusters attaining a weight of a pound and a half to two pounds. The\r\naccompanying plate, the fruit much less than half natural size, shows\r\nwhat a fine grape Muscat Hamburg is. One is struck with wondering\r\nadmiration at a vine laden with these grapes growing alongside\r\nConcord, Niagara or Delaware. The quality is delectable, the\r\nquintessence of the flavors and aromas which make the grape a favorite\r\nfruit. The grapes keep long and retain their form, size, color and\r\nrich, delicate flavor almost to the end. This variety is a treasure to\r\nthe amateur; and the professional who wants another grape for local\r\nmarkets should try grafting over a few vines of some native to this\r\nsort, following the directions given in Chapter X in caring for the\r\nvines.\r\n\r\n    Vines vigorous, tender, need protection during the winter; canes\r\n    long, numerous, slender to medium, light brown, darker at the\r\n    nodes which are enlarged and flattened. Leaves medium to large,\r\n    intermediate in thickness; upper surface light green, dull; lower\r\n    surface pale green, faintly pubescent, densely hairy.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens in October, ships and keeps well; clusters very\r\n    large, long, broad, tapering, single or double-shouldered. Berries\r\n    large, firm, oval, very dark purplish-red, covered with lilac\r\n    bloom, very persistent; skin thick, adheres strongly to the pulp;\r\n    flesh pale green, translucent, meaty, very juicy, tender, vinous,\r\n    musky, sweet, rich; very good to best; seeds separating easily\r\n    from the pulp, large.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCAT OF ALEXANDRIA\r\n\r\nThis is possibly the leading table- and raisin-grape of the Pacific\r\nslope. From the literature or from a visit to vineyards, one cannot\r\nmake out whether one or several varieties are grown under the name.\r\nProbably there are several strains grown under the distinctive name\r\n\"Muscat\" which applies to these sweet, light yellow, musky grapes.\r\nThis is one of the standard sorts to force indoors but requires too\r\nlong a season for out of doors in the East. The following description\r\nis compiled:\r\n\r\n    Vine short, straggling, bushy, sometimes forming a bush rather\r\n    than a vine, very productive; wood gray with dark spots,\r\n    short-jointed. Leaf round, five-lobed; bright green above, lighter\r\n    green below. Bunches long and loose, shouldered; berry oblong,\r\n    light yellow and transparent when fully mature, covered with white\r\n    bloom; flesh firm, crisp; flavor sweet and very musky; quality\r\n    good. Season late, the laterals producing a second and sometimes\r\n    even a third crop.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIAGARA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nNiagara (Plate XXVI) is the leading American green grape, holding the\r\nrank among grapes of this color that Concord maintains among black\r\nvarieties. It is, however, a less valuable grape than Concord, and it\r\nis doubtful whether it should be ranked much higher than several other\r\ngreen grapes. In vigor and productiveness, when the two grapes are on\r\nequal footing as to adaptability, Niagara and Concord rank the same.\r\nIn hardiness of root and vine, Niagara falls short of Concord; it\r\ncannot be relied on without winter protection where the thermometer\r\nfalls below zero. Niagara has much of the foxiness of the wild\r\nLabrusca, distasteful to many palates. Both bunches and berries of\r\nNiagara are larger than those of Concord and are better formed, making\r\na handsomer fruit if the colors are liked equally well. The fruit\r\nshells as badly as that of Concord and does not keep longer. Both vine\r\nand fruit of Niagara are more susceptible to fungal diseases than\r\nthose of Concord, especially to black-rot, which proves a veritable\r\nscourge with this variety in unfavorable seasons. Niagara was produced\r\nby C. L. Hoag and B. W. Clark, Lockport, New York, from seed of\r\nConcord fertilized by Cassady planted in 1868.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, lacking in hardiness, very productive. Canes long,\r\n    thick, reddish-brown deepening in color at the nodes which are\r\n    enlarged and slightly flattened; internodes long, thick; tendrils\r\n    continuous, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thick; upper\r\n    surface glossy, dark green, smooth; lower surface pale green,\r\n    pubescent; lobes three to five with terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    of medium depth and width; basal sinus shallow, wide, often\r\n    toothed; lateral sinus wide, frequently toothed; teeth shallow,\r\n    variable in width. Flowers self-fertile, open in mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters large, long, broad,\r\n    tapering, frequently single-shouldered, compact; pedicel thick\r\n    with a few, small, inconspicuous warts; brush pale green, long.\r\n    Berries large, oval, pale yellowish-green with thin bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin thin, tender, adherent, astringent; flesh\r\n    light green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tender, foxy; good.\r\n    Seeds free, one to six, deeply notched, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOAH\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nNoah is little grown at present outside of Missouri, where it is still\r\nplanted somewhat. Noah and Elvira are often confused but there are\r\nvery marked differences. The clusters of Elvira are smaller, the\r\nberries are more foxy in taste, and the skins are more tender and\r\ncrack more readily than do those of Noah. The large, dark, glossy\r\ngreen leaves make the vines of this variety very handsome. As with\r\nElvira and other varieties of this group, Noah is of little value in\r\nthe North. It originated with Otto Wasserzieher, Nauvoo, Illinois,\r\nfrom seed of Taylor planted in 1869.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, productive. Canes long, thick,\r\n    dark brown, surface roughened; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils\r\n    continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves large; upper surface dark\r\n    green, glossy, smooth; lower surface pale green, thinly pubescent;\r\n    leaf usually not lobed with terminus acuminate; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, wide; basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus very shallow when\r\n    present; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers semi-fertile, open early;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season, does not ship nor keep well. Clusters\r\n    variable in size, cylindrical, single-shouldered, compact; pedicel\r\n    short with a few small warts; brush short, brown. Berries small,\r\n    round, light green tinged with yellow, dull with thin bloom, firm;\r\n    skin adherent to pulp; flesh yellowish-green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    tough, fine-grained, vinous, sprightly; good. Seeds adherent, one\r\n    to four, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTHERN MUSCADINE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nThat this variety, together with Lucile, Lutie and other grapes with\r\nthe foxy taste strongly marked, has not become popular, in spite of\r\ngood vine characters, is evidence that the American public do not\r\ndesire such grapes. In appearance of fruit, Northern Muscadine is much\r\nlike Lutie, the two being distinguished from other grapes by an\r\nunmistakable odor. A serious defect of the fruit is that the berries\r\nshatter badly as soon as they reach maturity. Taken as a whole, the\r\nvine characters of this variety are very good and offer possibilities\r\nfor the grape-breeder. The variety originated at New Lebanon, New\r\nYork, and was brought to notice by D. J. Hawkins and Philemon Stewart\r\nof the Society of Shakers about 1852.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, productive, healthy, hardy. Canes slender, dark\r\n    brown, heavily pubescent; tendrils continuous, bifid, dehisce\r\n    early. Leaves large, round, thick; upper surface dull, rugose;\r\n    lower surface dark bronze, heavily pubescent. Flowers\r\n    self-fertile, open in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season, does not keep well. Clusters medium in\r\n    size, short, occasionally single-shouldered, compact. Berries\r\n    large, oval, dark amber with thin bloom, drop badly from the\r\n    pedicel; skin tough, adherent, astringent; flesh pale green,\r\n    juicy, fine-grained, tender, soft, very foxy, sweet; poor in\r\n    quality. Seeds free, numerous, large, broad, faintly notched,\r\n    long, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTON\r\n\r\n(Æstivalis, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nNorton is one of the leading wine-grapes in eastern America, the fruit\r\nhaving small value for any other purpose than wine or, possibly,\r\ngrape-juice. The vine is hardy but requires a long, warm season to\r\nreach maturity so that it is seldom grown successfully north of the\r\nPotomac. Norton thrives in rich alluvial clays, gravels or sands, the\r\nonly requisite seemingly being a fair amount of fertility and soil\r\nwarmth. The vines are robust; very productive, especially on fertile\r\nsoils; as free, or more so, from fungal diseases as any other of our\r\nnative grapes; and are very resistant to phylloxera. The bunches are\r\nof but medium size and the berries are small. The grapes are pleasant\r\neating when fully ripe, rich, spicy and pure-flavored but tart if not\r\nquite ripe. The variety is difficult to propagate from cuttings and to\r\ntransplant, and the vines do not bear grafts well. The origin of\r\nNorton is uncertain, but it has been under cultivation since before\r\n1830, when it was first described.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, healthy, half-hardy, productive. Canes long,\r\n    thick, dark brown with abundant bloom; nodes much enlarged;\r\n    internodes long; tendrils intermittent, occasionally continuous,\r\n    long, bifid, sometimes trifid. Leaves large, irregularly round;\r\n    upper surface pale green, dull, rugose; lower surface pale green,\r\n    pubescent; leaf usually not lobed with terminus acute; petiolar\r\n    sinus deep, narrow, sometimes closed and overlapping; basal sinus\r\n    usually absent; lateral sinus shallow or a mere notch when\r\n    present. Flowers self-fertile, late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters medium in size, short, broad,\r\n    tapering, single-shouldered, compact; pedicel slender with a few\r\n    warts; brush dull, wine-colored. Berries small, round-oblate,\r\n    black, glossy with heavy bloom, persistent, soft; skin thin, free\r\n    with much dark red pigment; flesh green, translucent, juicy,\r\n    tender, spicy, tart. Seeds free, two to six, small, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPORTO\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nOporto was at one time in demand as a wine grape because its wine\r\nresembled in color and flavor that from Oporto. The variety is now\r\nscarcely known, being inferior in most of its horticultural characters\r\nto others of its species, but might be valuable in breeding for some\r\nof its characters. The vine is very hardy, unusually free from fungal\r\ndiseases, is very resistant to phylloxera and has been used in France\r\nas a phylloxera-resistant grafting-stock. The juice is very thick and\r\ndark, a deep purple, hence suitable for adding color to wine or\r\ngrape-juice. The origin of Oporto is unknown. It was brought into\r\ncultivation about 1860 by E. W. Sylvester, Lyons, New York.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, healthy, variable in productiveness.\r\n    Canes long, reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    long, diaphragm thin; tendrils continuous, bifid. Stamens\r\n    reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ships and keeps well. Clusters small,\r\n    cylindrical, often single-shouldered. Berries medium in size,\r\n    round, black, glossy with abundant bloom, persistent, firm; skin\r\n    very thin, tender, with much dark wine-colored pigment; flesh\r\n    white, sometimes with purple tinge, juicy, fine-grained, solid,\r\n    sweet, spicy; fair quality. Seeds free, numerous, small, broad,\r\n    faintly notched, sharply pointed, plump, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHELLO\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Arnold's Hybrid, Canadian Hamburg, Canadian Hybrid_\r\n\r\nIn France, Othello does remarkably well as a direct producer and is\r\nused also for a resistant stock. While most of its characters are\r\nspoken of in the superlative by the French, in America the variety is\r\nnot so highly esteemed because of susceptibility to fungi. Moreover,\r\nthe fruit matures so late that it could never become a valuable\r\nvariety for the North. It is in no sense a table-grape but makes a\r\nwell-colored, pleasant wine. Charles Arnold, Paris, Ontario, grew\r\nOthello from seed of Clinton fertilized by Black Hamburg and planted\r\nin 1859.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, brown; nodes\r\n    enlarged, flattened; tendrils continuous, sometimes intermittent,\r\n    bifid or trifid. Leaves of average size; upper surface light\r\n    green, dull and smooth; lower surface pale green, pubescent; lobes\r\n    three to five with terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus deep, very\r\n    narrow, frequently closed and overlapping; basal sinus shallow,\r\n    narrow; lateral sinus deep; teeth deep, wide; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps fairly well. Clusters large, long, broad,\r\n    tapering, frequently with a loose single shoulder, compact;\r\n    pedicel long, slender with numerous small warts; brush short,\r\n    wine-colored. Berries large, oval, black, glossy with abundant\r\n    bloom, very persistent; skin thin, tough, adherent with red\r\n    pigment; flesh dark green, very juicy, fine-grained, tough,\r\n    sprightly; low in quality. Seeds free, one to three, neck\r\n    sometimes swollen, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nOZARK\r\n\r\n(Æstivalis, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nOzark belongs to the South and to Missouri in particular. Its merits\r\nand demerits have been threshed out by the Missouri grape-growers with\r\nthe result that its culture is somewhat increasing. It is a grape of\r\nlow quality, partly, perhaps, from over-bearing, which it habitually\r\ndoes unless the fruit is thinned. The vine is healthy and a very\r\nstrong grower, but is self-sterile, which is against it as a market\r\nsort. In spite of self-sterility and low quality, Ozark is a promising\r\nvariety for the country south of Pennsylvania. Ozark originated with\r\nJ. Stayman, Leavenworth, Kansas, from seed of unknown source. The\r\nvariety was introduced about 1890.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, thick with thin\r\n    bloom, surface roughened; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes\r\n    long; tendrils intermittent, usually bifid. Leaves dense, large;\r\n    upper surface light green; lower surface pale green, thinly\r\n    pubescent, cobwebby; lobes three to five; petiolar sinus deep,\r\n    narrow; serrations shallow, narrow. Flowers self-sterile or nearly\r\n    so, open late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps well. Clusters large, long, usually with a long,\r\n    loose shoulder, very compact; pedicel short, thick, smooth; brush\r\n    long, red. Berries variable in size, dull black with abundant\r\n    bloom, persistent; skin tough with much wine-colored pigment;\r\n    flesh tender, mild; fair in quality. Seeds free, small.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALOMINO\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Golden Chasselas, Listan_\r\n\r\nThis variety seems to be grown in California under the three names\r\ngiven--while in France Palomino is described as a bluish-black grape.\r\nPalomino seems to be grown commonly in California as a table-grape and\r\nis worth trying in eastern America. The variety received under the\r\nname Palomino from California at the New York Experiment Station has\r\nthe following characters, agreeing closely with those set down by\r\nCalifornian viticulturists:\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens about the 20th of October, keeping qualities good;\r\n    clusters medium to large, long, single-shouldered, tapering,\r\n    loose; berries medium to small, roundish, pale greenish-yellow,\r\n    thin bloom; skin and the adhering flesh medium tender and crisp,\r\n    flesh surrounding seeds melting; flavor sweet, vinous; quality\r\n    good.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEABODY\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nPeabody is as yet a comparatively unimportant offspring of Clinton.\r\nThe grapes are of excellent quality. It appears to do better in the\r\nnorthern tier of states or in Canada, than farther south. This\r\nvariety was grown by J. H. Ricketts about 1870.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, numerous, thick,\r\n    light brown with ash-gray tinge, darker at nodes, covered with\r\n    thin bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves medium in size; upper\r\n    surface dark green, thin; lower surface pale green, nearly\r\n    glabrous; lobes three, acuminate; petiolar sinus shallow, wide;\r\n    serration deep, narrow. Flowers semi-fertile, mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters large, long, usually with a\r\n    shoulder connected to the bunch by a long stem, compact; pedicel\r\n    short, slender, warty; brush short, green. Berries oval, black,\r\n    glossy, covered with thin bloom, persistent; skin thick, tough;\r\n    flesh very juicy, tender, vinous, spicy, agreeably sweet at the\r\n    skin, tart at the center; good. Seeds free, broad.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFECTION\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Bourquiniana, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nPerfection is a seedling of Delaware, which it greatly resembles but\r\ndoes not equal in fruit; its fruits being hardly as high in quality,\r\ndo not keep as well, shrivel more before ripening, and shell more\r\nreadily. In its vine characters, it is much more like a Labrusca than\r\nDelaware, suggesting that it is a Delaware cross. In the Southwest,\r\nPerfection is considered a valuable early red grape. J. Stayman,\r\nLeavenworth, Kansas, grew Perfection from seed of Delaware; it was\r\nsent out for testing about 1890.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, injured in severe winters, productive.\r\n    Canes of medium length and number, slender; nodes enlarged,\r\n    flattened; internodes short; tendrils intermittent, trifid or\r\n    bifid. Leaves healthy, medium in size; upper surface light green;\r\n    lower surface grayish-white with a tinge of bronze, heavily\r\n    pubescent; lobes wanting or three to five; petiolar sinus shallow,\r\n    wide; serration shallow. Flowers self-fertile or nearly so, open\r\n    in mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early. Clusters usually single-shouldered, compact; pedicel\r\n    short, slender, smooth; brush short, yellow. Berries small, round,\r\n    red but less brilliant than Delaware with faint bloom, inclined to\r\n    drop from pedicel, soft; skin thin, free from astringency; flesh\r\n    medium in juiciness and tenderness, vinous, mild, sweet; good in\r\n    quality. Seeds adherent, numerous, small, often with an enlarged\r\n    neck.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERKINS\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nAt one time Perkins was grown largely as an early grape but has been\r\ndiscarded very generally on account of the poor quality of the fruit.\r\nThe pulp of the grape is hard and the flavor is that of Wyoming and\r\nNorthern Muscadine, grapes characterized by disagreeable foxiness. As\r\nwith nearly all Labruscas, Perkins is a poor keeper. Notwithstanding\r\nthe faults of its fruit, the variety may have value in regions where\r\ngrape-growing is precarious; for in fruiting it is one of the most\r\nreliable grapes cultivated, the vines being hardy, vigorous,\r\nproductive and free from fungal diseases. Perkins is an accidental\r\nseedling found about 1830 in the garden of Jacob Perkins, Bridgewater,\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes long, numerous,\r\n    thick, dark brown, deepening in color at the nodes, surface\r\n    heavily pubescent; nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes long;\r\n    tendrils continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves medium in size,\r\n    thick; upper surface rugose; lower surface heavily pubescent;\r\n    veins distinct; lobes three; petiolar sinus deep, narrow;\r\n    serration shallow. Flowers self-fertile, early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, ships well. Clusters of medium size and length,\r\n    broad, cylindrical, often with a single shoulder, compact; pedicel\r\n    short, thick, warty; brush long, yellow. Berries large, oval, pale\r\n    lilac or light red with thin bloom, inclined to drop from the\r\n    pedicel, soft; skin thin, tough, without pigment; flesh white,\r\n    juicy, stringy, fine-grained, firm, meaty, very foxy; poor in\r\n    quality. Seeds adherent, numerous, medium in size, notched.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOCKLINGTON\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nBefore the advent of Niagara, Pocklington (Plate XXII) was the leading\r\ngreen grape. The variety has the fatal fault, however, of ripening\r\nits crop late, which with some minor defects has caused it to fall\r\nbelow Niagara for northern grape districts. Pocklington is a seedling\r\nof Concord and resembles its parent in vine characters; the vines are\r\nfully equal to or surpass those of Concord in hardiness, but are of\r\nslower growth and not quite as healthy, vigorous nor productive. In\r\nquality, the grapes are as good if not better than those of Concord or\r\nNiagara, being sweet, rich and pleasantly flavored, although as with\r\nthe other grapes named, it has too much foxiness for critical\r\nconsumers. Pocklington is not equal to several other grapes of its\r\nseason in quality, as Iona, Jefferson, Diana, Dutchess and Catawba,\r\nbut it is far above the average and for this reason should be\r\nretained. John Pocklington, Sandy Hill, New York, grew Pocklington\r\nfrom seed of Concord about 1870.\r\n\r\n    Vine medium in vigor, hardy. Canes of medium length, number and\r\n    size, dark reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils\r\n    continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves variable in size, thick; upper\r\n    surface light green, glossy; lower surface tinged with bronze,\r\n    pubescent; lobes one to three with terminus acuminate; petiolar\r\n    sinus deep, wide; teeth narrow. Flowers self-fertile, mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters large,\r\n    cylindrical, often single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    thick with a few small warts; brush short, green. Berries large,\r\n    oblate, yellowish-green with tinge of amber, with thin bloom,\r\n    firm; skin with scattering russet dots, thin, tender, adherent,\r\n    faintly astringent; flesh light green with yellow tinge,\r\n    translucent, juicy, tough, fine-grained, slightly foxy; good.\r\n    Seeds adherent, one to six, of medium length and breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOUGHKEEPSIE\r\n\r\n(Bourquiniana, Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nPoughkeepsie has been known long on the Hudson River, yet it is now\r\nlittle grown there and has not been disseminated widely elsewhere. In\r\nquality of fruit, it is equal to the best American varieties, but the\r\nvine characters are all poor and the variety is thus effectually\r\ndebarred from common cultivation. Both vine and fruit resemble those\r\nof Delaware, but in neither does it quite equal the latter. In\r\nparticular, the vine is more easily winter-killed and is less\r\nproductive than that of Delaware. The grapes ripen a little earlier\r\nthan those of the last named sort and this, with their beauty and fine\r\nquality, is sufficient to recommend it for the garden at least. About\r\n1865, A. J. Caywood, Marlboro, New York, grew Poughkeepsie from seed\r\nof Iona fertilized by mixed pollen of Delaware and Walter.\r\n\r\n    Vine of medium vigor. Canes short, thick, dark reddish-brown;\r\n    tendrils intermittent, frequently three in line, bifid or trifid.\r\n    Leaves small; upper surface green, glossy, older leaves rugose;\r\n    lower surface grayish-green, pubescent. Flowers self-fertile,\r\n    late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps and ships well. Clusters small, tapering,\r\n    usually single-shouldered, very compact. Berries small, round,\r\n    pale red with thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin, tender,\r\n    without pigment; flesh pale green, very juicy, tender, melting,\r\n    fine-grained, vinous, sweet; very good to best. Seeds free, small,\r\n    broad, with enlarged neck, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRENTISS\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nPrentiss is a green grape of high quality, once well known and\r\ngenerally recommended, but now going out of cultivation because the\r\nvine is tender to cold, lacks in vigor, is unproductive, uncertain in\r\nbearing and is subject to rot and mildew. There are vineyards in which\r\nit does very well and in such it is a remarkably attractive green\r\ngrape, especially in form of cluster and in color of berry, in these\r\nrespects resembling the one-time favorite, Rebecca, although not so\r\nhigh in quality as that variety. Its season is given as both before\r\nand after Concord. Prentiss always must remain a variety for the\r\namateur and for special localities. It originated with J. W. Prentiss,\r\nPulteney, New York, about 1870 from seed of Isabella.\r\n\r\n    Vine weak. Canes thick, light to dark brown; tendrils continuous,\r\n    bifid. Leaves small, thick; upper surface light green, rugose in\r\n    the older leaves; lower surface pale green, pubescent. Flowers\r\n    self-fertile, mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit variable in season, about with Concord, keeps well. Cluster\r\n    medium in size, tapering, sometimes with a single shoulder,\r\n    compact. Berries medium in size, oval, light green with a yellow\r\n    tinge, thin bloom, persistent, firm; skin tough, without pigment;\r\n    flesh pale green, juicy, foxy; good. Seeds adherent, numerous,\r\n    notched, short, sharp-pointed, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPLE CORNICHON\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Black Cornichon_\r\n\r\nBy virtue of attractive appearance and excellent shipping qualities of\r\nthe fruit, this variety takes high place among the commercial grapes\r\nof California. Late ripening is another quality making it desirable,\r\nwhile its curious, long, curved berries add novelty to its\r\nattractions. The fruit does not take high rank in quality. The\r\ndescription has been compiled.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, healthy and productive; wood light brown\r\n    striped with darker brown, short-jointed. Leaves large, longer\r\n    than wide, deeply five-lobed; dark green above, lighter and very\r\n    hairy below; coarsely toothed; with short, thick petiole. Bunches\r\n    very large, loose or sometimes scraggly, borne on long peduncles;\r\n    berries large, long, more or less curved, dark purple, spotted,\r\n    thick-skinned, borne on long pedicels; flesh firm, crisp, sweet\r\n    but not rich in flavor; quality good but not high. Season late,\r\n    keeps and ships well.\r\n\r\n\r\nREBECCA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the last century, when grape-growing was in the hands\r\nof the connoisseurs, Rebecca was one of the sterling green varieties.\r\nIt is wholly unsuited for commercial vineyards and for years has been\r\ndisappearing gradually from cultivation. The fruit is exceptionally\r\nfine, consisting of well-formed bunches and berries, the latter\r\nhandsome yellowish-white and semi-transparent. In quality, the grapes\r\nare of the best, with a rich, sweet flavor and pleasing aroma. But the\r\nvine characters condemn Rebecca for any but the amateur. The vines\r\nlack in hardiness and vigor, are susceptible to mildew and other fungi\r\nand are productive only under the best conditions. The original vine\r\nwas an accidental seedling found in the garden of E. M. Peake, Hudson,\r\nNew York, and bore its first fruit in 1852.\r\n\r\n    Vine weak, sometimes vigorous, doubtfully hardy. Canes long,\r\n    numerous, slender, dull brown, deepening in color at the nodes;\r\n    tendrils continuous or intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves\r\n    variable in size; upper surface dark green, dull, rugose; lower\r\n    surface grayish-green, pubescent. Flowers self-fertile; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season, ships and keeps well. Clusters small,\r\n    short, cylindrical, rarely with a small, single shoulder, compact.\r\n    Berries of medium size, oval, green with yellow tinge verging on\r\n    amber, thin gray bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin, without\r\n    pigment; flesh pale green, very juicy, tender, melting, vinous, a\r\n    little foxy, sweet; good to very good. Seeds free, short, narrow,\r\n    blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED EAGLE\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nRed Eagle is a pure-bred seedling of Black Eagle which it resembles in\r\nall characters except color of fruit. Vine and fruit exhibit the\r\ncharacters found in Rogers' hybrids. It takes high rank as a grape of\r\nquality and can be recommended for the garden. The variety originated\r\nwith T. V. Munson, Denison, Texas, and was sent out in 1888.\r\n\r\n    Vine medium in vigor and hardiness, productive. Canes few,\r\n    slender, dark brown with heavy bloom; nodes prominent, flattened;\r\n    tendrils continuous or intermittent, long, bifid. Leaves thick;\r\n    upper surface light green, dull, rugose; lower surface\r\n    grayish-green, pubescent; lobes three to five with terminus\r\n    obtuse; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, sometimes closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus wide; lateral sinus deep, wide; teeth\r\n    deep, wide. Flowers semi-fertile, late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season, keeps well. Clusters small, broad,\r\n    tapering, single-shouldered, sometimes double-shouldered, loose\r\n    with many abortive berries; pedicel very long, slender; brush\r\n    green with brown tinge. Berries variable in size, round, light to\r\n    very dark red with heavy bloom, persistent, soft; skin thick,\r\n    tender, adherent with some red pigment; flesh green, transparent,\r\n    juicy, very tender, melting, slightly foxy, tart; very good. Seeds\r\n    free, one to five, large, long, blunt, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGAL\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nRegal is an offspring of Lindley, which it greatly resembles. The\r\nfruit is attractive in appearance and high in quality. A seemingly\r\ninsignificant fault might make Regal undesirable in a commercial\r\nvineyard; the clusters are borne so close to the wood that it is\r\ndifficult to harvest the fruit and avoid injury to the berries next to\r\nthe wood. The variety is worthy of extensive culture in vineyards and\r\ngardens. Regal originated with W. A. Woodward, Rockford, Illinois, in\r\n1879.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, very productive. Canes intermediate\r\n    in length and size, numerous, dark reddish-brown. Tendrils\r\n    intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves large; upper surface green,\r\n    glossy and rugose; lower surface pale green with a bronze tinge,\r\n    strongly pubescent. Flowers self-fertile, mid-season; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, keeps well. Clusters small, broad, cylindrical,\r\n    usually with a short single shoulder, sometimes double-shouldered,\r\n    very compact. Berries large, round, purplish-red with faint bloom,\r\n    persistent. Skin thin, tough, without pigment. Flesh pale green,\r\n    very juicy, fine-grained, tender, musky; good. Seeds free,\r\n    numerous, long, narrow, notched, blunt with a short neck, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThis is one of Rogers' hybrids which equals other grapes of its color\r\nand season. The grapes are attractive in cluster and berry and are of\r\nvery good quality but are subject to rot and ripen too late for\r\nnorthern regions. The variety was named Requa in 1869, it having been\r\npreviously known as No. 28.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy except in severe winters, medium in\r\n    productiveness. Canes long, thick; tendrils continuous or\r\n    intermittent, trifid or bifid. Leaves medium in size, dark green,\r\n    often thick and rugose; lower surface grayish-green, pubescent.\r\n    Flowers semi-fertile, late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps long. Clusters large, cylindrical, often with a\r\n    long, single shoulder, compact. Berries large, oval, dark, dull\r\n    red covered with thin bloom, strongly adherent; skin thin, tough,\r\n    adherent; flesh pale green, tender, stringy, vinous, foxy, sweet;\r\n    good to very good. Seeds adherent, medium in size and length,\r\n    broad, blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nROCHESTER\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Rochester is a large-clustered red grape, handsome and\r\nvery good in quality. The vine is a strong grower, productive and free\r\nfrom diseases. The variety is difficult to propagate and, therefore,\r\nnot in favor with nurserymen. The grapes are sweet, rich and vinous\r\nbut should be used as soon as ripe, as they do not keep well and the\r\nberries quickly shatter from the bunch. As an attractive early red\r\ngrape, Rochester is worth a place in the garden and in favored\r\nlocations for a special market. Ellwanger and Barry, Rochester, New\r\nYork, in 1867 grew Rochester from mixed seed of Delaware, Diana,\r\nConcord and Rebecca.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive. Canes long, dark reddish-brown;\r\n    nodes enlarged, flattened; internodes short; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves large; upper surface\r\n    light green, glossy, smooth; lower surface grayish-green,\r\n    pubescent; lobes one to three with terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep; basal sinus absent; lateral sinus shallow; teeth shallow.\r\n    Flowers fertile, mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit does not keep well. Clusters large, broad, tapering, usually\r\n    single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, slender with few warts;\r\n    brush slender, yellowish-brown. Berries medium, oval,\r\n    purplish-red, dull with thin, lilac bloom, drop from the\r\n    pedicel, soft; skin thick, tough, inclined to crack, free, without\r\n    pigment, astringent; flesh pale green, transparent, juicy, tender,\r\n    fine-grained, vinous, sweet; good to very good. Seeds free, one to\r\n    three, large, short, broad, dark brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE XXXII.--Wyoming (×2/3).]\r\n\r\n\r\nROMMEL\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vulpina, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nRommel is rarely cultivated in the North, because the vines lack in\r\nrobustness, hardiness and productiveness and are susceptible to the\r\nleaf-hopper; and the grapes do not attain high quality and crack as\r\nthey ripen. The bunch and berry are attractive in form, size and\r\ncolor. At its best, Rommel is a good table-grape and makes a fine\r\nwhite wine. It is worth growing in the South. T. V. Munson, Denison,\r\nTexas, originated Rommel in 1885, from seed of Elvira pollinated by\r\nTriumph, and introduced it in 1889.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous in the South. Canes long, numerous, thick,\r\n    reddish-brown, surface roughened; nodes enlarged, often flattened;\r\n    internodes short; tendrils intermittent, long, bifid or trifid.\r\n    Leaves medium in size, round, thick; upper surface light green,\r\n    dull, rugose; lower surface pale green, free from pubescence but\r\n    slightly hairy; leaf not lobed, terminus acute to acuminate;\r\n    petiolar sinus deep, narrow, often closed and overlapping; basal\r\n    sinus lacking; lateral sinus shallow when present; teeth deep.\r\n    Flowers semi-fertile, late; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit mid-season, ships and keeps well. Clusters medium to short,\r\n    broad, cylindrical, single-shouldered, compact; pedicel slender,\r\n    smooth; brush short, pale green. Berries large, roundish, light\r\n    green with a yellow tinge, glossy, persistent, firm; skin thin,\r\n    cracks badly, tender, adherent, without pigment or astringency;\r\n    flesh greenish, translucent, juicy, tender, melting, stringy,\r\n    sweet; fair to good. Seeds free, one to four, broad,\r\n    sharp-pointed, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSAKI\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nRosaki is a table-and raisin-grape of southeastern Europe and Asia\r\nMinor. According to some of the California nursery companies, it is\r\ngrown in that state under the name Dattier de Beyrouth, although it\r\nwould seem from French descriptions that there is a separate, very\r\nlate variety of the latter name. Rosaki is similar to Malaga and there\r\nis a possibility that in some of the warmer parts of the East, it may\r\nbe grown commercially as a substitute for the latter. The variety\r\nseems to be little grown on the Pacific slope.\r\n\r\n    Vines vigorous, usually very productive. Leaves large, roundish,\r\n    rugose, usually five-lobed; terminal lobe acuminate; petiolar\r\n    sinus moderately deep to deep, medium broad; lower lateral sinus\r\n    shallow, broad, occasionally lacking; upper lateral sinus shallow\r\n    to medium, broad; margins broadly and bluntly dentate. Fruit\r\n    ripens the third week in October, keeping qualities excellent;\r\n    clusters large, loose, tapering, shouldered; berries large to very\r\n    large, oval to long-oval, pale yellow-green; flesh translucent,\r\n    tender, meaty, vinous, sprightly; quality good to very good.\r\n\r\n\r\nROSE OF PERU\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nRose of Peru is a favorite table-grape in California, confused with\r\nand possibly the same as Black Prince. Its chief commendable\r\ncharacters are handsome appearance and high quality of fruit and very\r\nproductive vines. It is not adapted for shipping and does not enter\r\nplentifully into commerce. Its season is so late that the variety is\r\nhardly worth trying in the East, and yet it has matured in favorable\r\nseasons at Geneva, New York. The following description is compiled:\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, healthy, productive; wood short-jointed, dark\r\n    brown. Leaves of medium size; deep green above, lighter green and\r\n    tomentose below. Bunches very large, shouldered, very loose, often\r\n    scraggly; berry large, round, black with firm, crackling flesh;\r\n    skin rather thin and tender; flavor sweet and rich; quality very\r\n    good to best. Season late, keeping rather well but not shipping\r\n    well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALEM\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Rogers' No. 22, Rogers' No. 53_\r\n\r\nSalem (Plate XXVII) is the one of Rogers' hybrids of which the\r\noriginator is said to have thought most, and to which he gave the name\r\nof his place of residence. The two chief faults, unproductiveness and\r\nsusceptibility to mildew, are not found in all localities, and in\r\nthese districts, near good markets, Salem ought to rank high as a\r\ncommercial fruit. The vine is hardy, vigorous and productive and bears\r\nhandsome fruit of high quality. This variety was christened Salem by\r\nRogers in 1867, two years earlier than his other hybrids were named.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, variable in productiveness. Canes long, dark\r\n    brown; nodes enlarged; tendrils continuous or intermittent, long,\r\n    bifid or trifid. Leaves variable in size; upper surface dark\r\n    green, dull; lower surface pale green with slight bronze tinge,\r\n    pubescent; lobes one to three with terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    deep, narrow, often overlapping; basal sinus lacking; lateral\r\n    sinus shallow, narrow, notched. Flowers sterile, mid-season;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps and ships well. Clusters large, short, broad,\r\n    tapering, heavily shouldered, compact; pedicel short, thick with\r\n    small warts, enlarged at point of attachment to berry; brush\r\n    short, pale green. Berries large, round, dark red, dull,\r\n    persistent, soft; skin thick, adherent, without pigment,\r\n    astringent; flesh translucent, juicy, tender, stringy,\r\n    fine-grained, vinous, sprightly; good to very good. Seeds one to\r\n    six, large, long and broad, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCUPPERNONG\r\n\r\n(Rotundifolia)\r\n\r\n_American Muscadine, Bull, Bullace, Bullet, Fox Grape, Green\r\nScuppernong, Green Muscadine, Hickman, Muscadine, Roanoke_\r\n\r\nScuppernong is preëminently the grape of the South, the chief\r\nrepresentative of the great species, _V. rotundifolia_, which runs\r\nriot in natural luxuriance from Delaware and Maryland to the Gulf and\r\nwestward from the Atlantic to Arkansas and Texas. Scuppernong vines\r\nare found on arbors, in gardens, or half wild, on trees and fences on\r\nnearly every farm in the South Atlantic states. As a rule, these vines\r\nreceive little cultivation, are unpruned and are given no care of any\r\nkind; but even under neglect they produce large crops. The vines are\r\nalmost immune to mildew, rot, phylloxera, or other fungal or insect\r\npests; they give not only an abundance of fruit but on arbors and\r\ntrellises are much prized for their shade and beauty. The fruit, to a\r\npalate accustomed to other grapes, is not very acceptable, having a\r\nmusky flavor and a somewhat repugnant odor, which, however, with\r\nfamiliarity becomes quite agreeable. The pulp is sweet and juicy but\r\nis lacking in sprightliness. The grapes are not suitable for the\r\nmarket since the berries drop from the bunch in ripening and become\r\nmore or less smeared with juice so that their appearance is not\r\nappetizing.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, not hardy in the North, very productive. Canes\r\n    long, numerous, slender, ash-gray to grayish-brown; surface\r\n    smooth, thickly covered with small, light brown dots; tendrils\r\n    intermittent, simple. Leaves small, thin; upper surface light\r\n    green, smooth; lower surface very pale green, pubescent along the\r\n    ribs; veins inconspicuous. Flowers very late; stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, ripens unevenly, berries drop as they mature. Clusters\r\n    small, round, unshouldered, loose. Berries few in a cluster,\r\n    large, round, dull green, often with brown tinge, firm; skin\r\n    thick, tough with many small russet dots; flesh pale green, juicy,\r\n    tender, soft, fine-grained, foxy, sweet to agreeably tart; fair to\r\n    good. Seeds adherent, large, short, broad, unnotched, blunt,\r\n    plump, surface smooth, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECRETARY\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\nInjured by mildew and rot which attack leaves, fruit and young wood,\r\nthe vines of Secretary are able to produce good grapes only in\r\nexceptional seasons and in favored localities. The fruit characters\r\nof Secretary, however, give the grapes exceptionally high quality, the\r\nberries being meaty yet juicy, fine-grained and tender, with a sweet,\r\nspicy, vinous flavor. The bunches are large, well-formed, with\r\nmedium-sized, purplish-black berries covered with thick bloom, making\r\na very handsome cluster. While the vine and foliage somewhat resemble\r\nthose of Clinton, one of its parents, the variety is not nearly as\r\nhardy, vigorous nor productive. Moreover, in any but favored\r\nlocalities in the North, its maturity is somewhat uncertain. These\r\ndefects keep Secretary from becoming of commercial importance and make\r\nit of value only to the amateur. Secretary is one of the first\r\nproductions of J. H. Ricketts, Newburgh, New York, the original vine\r\ncoming from seed of Clinton fertilized by Muscat Hamburg, planted in\r\n1867.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, doubtfully hardy, variable in productiveness. Canes\r\n    numerous, light brown, conspicuously darker at nodes, surface\r\n    covered with thin, blue bloom; tendrils intermittent, bifid.\r\n    Leaves small to medium, thin; upper surface light green, dull,\r\n    smooth; lower surface pale green, glabrous. Flowers semi-fertile,\r\n    early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens after Concord, keeps and ships well. Clusters large,\r\n    long, cylindrical with a large, single shoulder, often loose and\r\n    with many abortive fruits. Berries large, round, flattened at\r\n    attachment to pedicel, dark purplish-black, glossy, persistent,\r\n    firm; skin tough with wine-colored pigment; flesh green, juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, tender, vinous, sweet; good. Seeds free, large,\r\n    broad, notched, long, dark brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSENASQUA\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe vine of Senasqua lacks in vigor, hardiness, productiveness and\r\nhealth. The grapes are of good quality, and when well grown are up to\r\nthe average fruits of the Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids. Unfortunately the\r\nberries have a tendency to crack which is aggravated by the bunches\r\nbeing so compact as to crowd the berries. Senasqua is one of the\r\nlatest grapes to open its buds and is, therefore, seldom injured by\r\nlate frosts. It can be recommended only for the garden for the sake\r\nof variety. Stephen W. Underhill of Crown Point, New York, originated\r\nSenasqua from seed of Concord pollinated by Black Prince.\r\n\r\n    Vine weak and tender, often unproductive. Canes short, few,\r\n    reddish-brown; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    long, trifid or bifid. Leaves light green, glossy, rugose; lower\r\n    surface whitish-green, pubescent; leaf usually not lobed with\r\n    terminus acute; petiolar sinus narrow; basal and lateral sinuses\r\n    shallow and narrow when present. Flowers fertile, late; stamens\r\n    upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit a little later than Concord, keeps well. Clusters large,\r\n    broad, irregularly tapering, usually with a small, single\r\n    shoulder, very compact; pedicel thick, smooth, enlarged at point\r\n    of attachment; brush short, reddish. Berries large, round,\r\n    reddish-black, persistent, firm; skin thick, tender, cracks,\r\n    adherent, contains some wine-colored pigment; flesh green,\r\n    translucent, juicy, tender, meaty, vinous, spicy; good. Seeds\r\n    free, one to five, long, narrow, one-sided, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULTANA\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThis variety was formerly the standard seedless grape in California\r\nfor home use and raisins, but it is now outstripped by Sultanina.\r\nSultana is possibly better flavored than Sultanina but the vines are\r\nhardly as vigorous or productive and the berries often have seeds. The\r\ndescription is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Vines vigorous, upright, productive. Leaves large, five-lobed,\r\n    with large sinuses, light in color, coarsely toothed. Bunches\r\n    large, long, cylindrical, heavily shouldered, sometimes not well\r\n    filled, often loose and scraggly; berries small, round, firm and\r\n    crisp, golden-yellow, sweet with considerable piquancy; quality\r\n    good.\r\n\r\n\r\nSULTANINA\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Thompson's Seedless_\r\n\r\nSultanina is one of the standard seedless grapes of the Pacific slope,\r\ngrown both to eat out of hand and for raisins. Probably it can be\r\ngrown in home plantations in favored parts of eastern America where\r\nthe season is long and warm. The following description is compiled\r\nfrom Californian viticulturists:\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, very productive; trunk large with very long\r\n    canes. Leaves glabrous on both sides, dark yellow-green above,\r\n    light below; generally three-lobed, with shallow sinuses; teeth\r\n    short and obtuse. Bunch large, conico-cylindrical, well filled,\r\n    with herbaceous peduncles; berries oval, beautiful golden-yellow\r\n    color; skin moderately thick; flesh of rather neutral flavor; very\r\n    good.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAYLOR\r\n\r\n(Vulpina, Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Bullitt_\r\n\r\nWhile it is from the species to which Taylor belongs that we must look\r\nfor our hardiest vines, nevertheless this grape and its offspring,\r\nalthough not tender to cold, do best in southern regions, as they\r\nrequire a long warm summer to mature properly. The quality of the\r\nfruit of Taylor is fair to good, the flavor being sweet, pure,\r\ndelicate and spicy and the flesh tender and juicy; but the bunches are\r\nsmall and the flowers are infertile so that the berries do not set\r\nwell, making very imperfect and unsightly clusters. The skin is such,\r\nalso, that it cracks badly, a defect seemingly transmitted to many of\r\nthe seedlings of the variety. The vine is strong, healthy, hardy but\r\nnot very productive. The original vine of Taylor was a wild seedling\r\nfound in the early part of the last century on the Cumberland\r\nMountains near the Kentucky-Tennessee line by a Mr. Cobb.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous to rank, healthy, hardy, variable in productiveness.\r\n    Leaves small, attractive in color, smooth. Flowers bloom early;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripens about two weeks before Isabella. Clusters small to\r\n    medium, shouldered, loose or moderately compact. Berries small to\r\n    medium, roundish, pale greenish-white, sometimes tinged with\r\n    amber; skin very thin; pulp sweet, spicy; fair to good in quality.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIUMPH\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nWhen quality, color, shape and size of bunch and berry are considered,\r\nTriumph (Plate XXVIII) is one of the finest dessert grapes of America.\r\nAt its best, it is a magnificent bunch of golden grapes of highest\r\nquality, esteemed even in southern Europe where it must compete with\r\nthe best of the Viniferas. In America, however, its commercial\r\nimportance is curtailed by the fact that the fruit requires a long\r\nseason for proper development. Triumph has, in general, the vine\r\ncharacters of the Labrusca parent, Concord, especially its habit of\r\ngrowth, vigor, productiveness and foliage characters, falling short in\r\nhardiness, resistance to fungal diseases and earliness of fruit, the\r\nfruit maturing with or a little later than Catawba. While the vine\r\ncharacters of Triumph are those of Labrusca, there is scarcely a\r\nsuggestion of the coarseness, or of the foxy odor and taste of\r\nLabrusca, and the objectionable seeds, pulp and skin of the native\r\ngrape give way to the far less objectionable structures of Vinifera.\r\nThe flesh is tender and melting and the flavor rich, sweet, vinous,\r\npure and delicate. The skins of the berries under unfavorable\r\nconditions crack badly, the variety, therefore, neither shipping nor\r\nkeeping well. Triumph was grown soon after the Civil War by George W.\r\nCampbell, Delaware, Ohio, from seed of Concord fertilized by Chasselas\r\nMusque.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous. Canes long, dark brown with much bloom; nodes\r\n    enlarged; tendrils intermittent, long, trifid, sometimes bifid.\r\n    Leaves large; upper surface light green, dull, rugose; lower\r\n    surface grayish-white, pubescent; leaf usually not lobed with\r\n    terminus obtuse; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, often closed and\r\n    overlapping; basal sinus absent; lateral sinus shallow and narrow\r\n    when present; teeth deep, wide. Flowers self-fertile, late;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit very late. Clusters very large, long, broad, cylindrical,\r\n    sometimes single-shouldered, compact; pedicel slender, smooth;\r\n    brush short, yellowish-green. Berries medium in size, oval, golden\r\n    yellow, glossy with heavy bloom, persistent, firm; skin thin,\r\n    inclined to crack, adherent, without pigment, slightly\r\n    astringent; flesh light green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained,\r\n    tender, vinous; good to very good. Seeds free, one to five, small,\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nULSTER\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe vines of Ulster set too much fruit in spite of efforts to control\r\nthe crop by pruning; two undesirable results follow, the bunches are\r\nsmall and the vines, lacking vigor at best, fail to recover from the\r\noverfruitfulness. These defects keep the variety from becoming of\r\nimportance commercially or even a favorite as a garden grape. The\r\nquality of the fruit is very good, being much like that of Catawba,\r\nand under favorable conditions it is an attractive green with a red\r\ntinge. The fruit keeps well when the variety is grown under conditions\r\nsuited to it. Ulster originated with A. J. Caywood, Marlboro, New\r\nYork, and was introduced by him about 1885. Its parents are said to be\r\nCatawba pollinated by a wild Æstivalis. Both vine and fruit show\r\ntraces of Labrusca and Vinifera, but the Æstivalis characters, if\r\npresent, are not apparent.\r\n\r\n    Vine hardy, productive, overbears. Canes short, slender, dark\r\n    brown, surface roughened and covered with faint pubescence; nodes\r\n    enlarged and flattened; internodes short; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    bifid, dehisce early. Leaves small, thick; upper surface light\r\n    green, glossy, smooth; lower surface grayish-white, pubescent;\r\n    leaf usually not lobed with terminus acute; petiolar sinus medium\r\n    to wide; basal sinus absent; lateral sinus a notch when present;\r\n    teeth shallow, wide. Flowers self-fertile, early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late mid-season. Clusters long, cylindrical, often\r\n    single-shouldered, compact; pedicel slender, with numerous warts;\r\n    brush short, yellowish-green. Berries medium in size, round, dark\r\n    dull red with thin bloom, persistent; skin thick, tough, adherent,\r\n    astringent; flesh pale green, translucent, juicy, tender,\r\n    fine-grained, faintly aromatic, slightly foxy; good to very good.\r\n    Seeds free, one to six, medium in size, plump, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERDAL\r\n\r\n(Vinifera)\r\n\r\n_Aspiran Blanc_\r\n\r\nVerdal is one of the standard late grapes of the Pacific slope,\r\nripening among the last. The grapes are seen seldom in distant markets\r\nand the quality is not quite good enough to make it a very great\r\nfavorite for home plantations. Vigor and hardiness of vines commend it\r\nas do the large and handsome fruits, and these qualities, with late\r\nripening, will probably long keep it on grape lists in the far West.\r\nThe description is compiled.\r\n\r\n    Vines vigorous, hardy, healthy and productive; canes rather\r\n    slender, half erect. Leaves of medium size, glabrous on both\r\n    surfaces, except below near the axis of the main nerve; sinuses\r\n    well marked and generally closed, giving the leaf the appearance\r\n    of having five holes; teeth long, unequal, acuminate. Bunches\r\n    large to very large, irregular, long-conical, usually compact;\r\n    shoulders small or lacking; berries large or very large,\r\n    yellowish-green; skin thick but tender; flesh crisp, firm; flavor\r\n    agreeable but not rich; quality good. Season very late, keeping\r\n    and shipping well.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERGENNES\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nThe most valuable attribute of Vergennes (Plate XXIX) is certainty in\r\nbearing. The vine seldom fails to bear although it often overbears,\r\ncausing variability in size of fruits and time of ripening. With a\r\nmoderate crop, the grapes ripen with Concord, but with a heavy load\r\nfrom one to two weeks later. Vergennes is somewhat unpopular with\r\nvineyardists because of the sprawling habit of the vines which makes\r\nthem untractable for vineyard operations; this fault is obviated by\r\ngrafting on other vines. The grapes are attractive, the quality is\r\ngood, flavor agreeable, the flesh tender, and seeds and skin are not\r\nobjectionable. Vergennes is the standard late-keeping grape for\r\nnorthern regions, being very common in the markets as late as January.\r\nThe original vine was a chance seedling in the garden of William E.\r\nGreene, Vergennes, Vermont, in 1874.\r\n\r\n    Vine variable in vigor, doubtfully hardy, productive, healthy.\r\n    Canes long, dark brown; nodes enlarged, strongly flattened;\r\n    tendrils continuous, long, bifid or trifid. Leaves large, thin;\r\n    upper surface light green, glossy, rugose; lower surface pale\r\n    green, very pubescent; leaf usually not lobed with terminus\r\n    broadly acute; petiolar sinus wide; teeth shallow. Flowers\r\n    semi-sterile, mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit late, keeps and ships well. Clusters of medium size, broad,\r\n    cylindrical, sometimes single-shouldered, loose; pedicel with\r\n    numerous small warts; brush slender, short, pale green. Berries\r\n    large, oval, light and dark red with thin bloom, persistent; skin\r\n    thick, tough, adherent, astringent; flesh pale green, juicy,\r\n    fine-grained, somewhat stringy, tender, vinous; good to very good.\r\n    Seeds free, one to five, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALTER\r\n\r\n(Vinifera, Labrusca, Bourquiniana)\r\n\r\nWere it not almost impossible to grow healthy vines of Walter, the\r\nvariety would rank high among American grapes. But stunted by fungi\r\nwhich attack leaves, young wood and fruit, it is possible only in\r\nexceptionally favorable seasons satisfactorily to produce crops of\r\nthis variety. Besides susceptibility to diseases, the vines are\r\nfastidious to soils, everywhere variable in growth and are injured in\r\ncold winters. As if to atone for the faults of the vine, the fruit of\r\nWalter is almost perfect, lacking only in size of bunch and berry. The\r\nbunch and berry resemble those of Delaware, but the fruit is not as\r\nhigh in quality as that of its parents. Walter is adapted to\r\nconditions under which Delaware thrives. A. J. Caywood, Modena, New\r\nYork, grew this variety about 1850 from seed of Delaware pollinated by\r\nDiana.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous. Canes medium in length and size, dark reddish-brown\r\n    with thin bloom; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils intermittent,\r\n    bifid. Leaves thick; upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth;\r\n    lower surface tinged with bronze, heavily pubescent; lobes one to\r\n    three with terminus acute; petiolar sinus narrow; basal sinus\r\n    lacking; lateral sinus a notch if present. Flowers mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps and ships well. Clusters medium in size, broad,\r\n    cylindrical, usually single-shouldered, compact; pedicel slender,\r\n    with small, scattering warts; brush short, slender, green with\r\n    brown tinge. Berries small, ovate, red, glossy with thin bloom,\r\n    persistent, firm; skin very tough, adheres slightly, unpigmented;\r\n    flesh pale green, translucent, juicy, tough, somewhat foxy,\r\n    vinous, aromatic; good to very good. Seeds adherent, one to four,\r\n    small, sharp-pointed, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWILDER\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera)\r\n\r\nThe fruit of Wilder is surpassed in quality and appearance by other of\r\nRogers' hybrids, but the vine is the most reliable of any of these\r\nhybrid sorts, being vigorous, hardy, productive, and, although\r\nsomewhat susceptible to mildew, as healthy as any. Wilder is not as\r\nwell known in the markets as it should be, and now that fungal\r\ndiseases can be controlled by spraying should be more commonly planted\r\nin commercial vineyards, especially for local markets. Wilder is one\r\nof the forty-five Labrusca-Vinifera hybrids raised by E. S. Rogers,\r\nSalem, Massachusetts, having been described first in 1858.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, productive, susceptible to mildew. Canes\r\n    long, numerous, reddish-brown, darker at the nodes; internodes\r\n    long; tendrils intermittent, bifid or trifid. Leaves large,\r\n    irregularly round; upper surface dark green, glossy, smooth; lower\r\n    surface pale green, pubescent; usually not lobed with terminus\r\n    acute; petiolar sinus deep, narrow, often closed and overlapping;\r\n    basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus shallow, narrow, or a mere\r\n    notch when present. Flowers self-sterile, mid-season; stamens\r\n    reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early mid-season, keeps and ships well. Clusters variable in\r\n    size, short, broad, tapering, heavily single-shouldered, loose;\r\n    pedicel long, thick with numerous warts; brush thick, green with\r\n    tinge of red. Berries large, oval, purplish-black with heavy\r\n    bloom, persistent, firm; skin thick, adherent to pulp, with bright\r\n    red pigment, astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy, tender;\r\n    good. Seeds adherent, one to five, long, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWINCHELL\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera, Æstivalis)\r\n\r\n_Green Mountain_\r\n\r\nThe vines of Winchell (Plate XXX) are vigorous, hardy, healthy,\r\nproductive, and the fruit is early, of high quality and ships\r\nwell--altogether a most admirable early grape. There are some minor\r\nfaults which become drawbacks in the culture of Winchell. The berries,\r\nand under some conditions the bunches, are small and the bunch is\r\nloose with a large shoulder. Sometimes this looseness becomes so\r\npronounced as to give a straggling, poorly-formed cluster; and the\r\nshoulder, when as large as the cluster itself, which often happens,\r\nmakes the cluster unsightly. The grapes shell when fully ripe, a\r\nserious fault. Again, while the crop usually ripens evenly, there are\r\nseasons when two pickings are needed because of the unevenness in\r\nripening. Lastly, the skin is thin and there is danger in unfavorable\r\nseasons of the berries cracking, although this is seldom a serious\r\nfault. These defects do not offset the several good characters of\r\nWinchell which make it the standard early green grape, deserving to\r\nrank with the best early grapes of any color. The original vine was\r\nraised by James Milton Clough, Stamford, Vermont, about 1850 from seed\r\nof an unknown purple grape.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, very productive. Canes long,\r\n    numerous, slender, dark brown with thin bloom; nodes enlarged,\r\n    flattened; tendrils continuous, sometimes intermittent, bifid.\r\n    Leaves large; upper surface light green, glossy, smooth; lower\r\n    surface dull green, tinged with bronze, faintly pubescent; lobes\r\n    three to five with terminal lobe acute; petiolar sinus deep; basal\r\n    sinus shallow; teeth shallow, wide. Flowers fertile, mid-season;\r\n    stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps and ships well. Clusters long, slender,\r\n    cylindrical, often with a long shoulder, compact; pedicel short,\r\n    slender with few inconspicuous warts; brush greenish-white.\r\n    Berries small, round, light green, persistent, soft; skin marked\r\n    with small, reddish-brown spots, thin, tender, slightly\r\n    astringent; flesh green, translucent, juicy, tender, fine-grained,\r\n    sweet; very good to best. Seeds free, one to four, small, plump,\r\n    wide and long, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODRUFF\r\n\r\n(Labrusca, Vinifera?)\r\n\r\nWoodruff is a handsome, showy, brick-red grape with large clusters and\r\nberries, but its taste belies its looks, for the flesh is coarse and\r\nthe flavor poor. The variety would not be worth attention were it not\r\nfor its excellent vine characters; the vines are hardy, productive and\r\nhealthy. The grapes ripen a little before Concord and come on the\r\nmarket at a favorable time, especially for a red grape. Woodruff\r\noriginated from C. H. Woodruff, Ann Arbor, Michigan, as a chance\r\nseedling which came up in 1874 and fruited first in 1877.\r\n\r\n    Vine very vigorous, hardy. Canes dark brown; nodes enlarged,\r\n    flattened; tendrils continuous, bifid or trifid. Leaves round;\r\n    upper surface light green, dull, rugose; lower surface\r\n    greenish-white, pubescent; leaf usually not lobed with terminus\r\n    acute; petiolar sinus wide; basal sinus lacking; lateral sinus\r\n    shallow and narrow when present; teeth shallow. Flowers\r\n    semi-fertile, early; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit ripening before Concord. Clusters broad, widely tapering,\r\n    usually single-shouldered, compact; pedicel short, thick, smooth;\r\n    brush long, pale green. Berries large, round, dark red, dull,\r\n    firm; skin thin, tender, adherent, slightly astringent; flesh pale\r\n    green, translucent, juicy, tough, coarse, very foxy; fair in\r\n    quality. Seeds adherent, one to five, broad, short, plump, blunt,\r\n    brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDEN\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\nOf the many offspring of Concord, Worden (Plate XXXI) is best known\r\nand most meritorious. The grapes differ chiefly from those of Concord\r\nin having larger berries and bunches, in having better quality and in\r\nbeing a week to ten days earlier. The vine is equally hardy, healthy,\r\nvigorous and productive but is more fastidious in its adaptations to\r\nsoil, although now and then it does even better. The chief fault of\r\nthe variety is that the fruit cracks badly, often preventing the\r\nprofitable marketing of a crop. Besides this tenderness of skin, the\r\nfruit-pulp of Worden is softer than that of Concord, there is more\r\njuice, and the keeping qualities are not as good, so that the grapes\r\nhardly ship as well as those of the more commonly grown grape. Worden\r\nis very popular in northern grape regions both for commercial\r\nplantations and the garden. It is a more desirable inhabitant of the\r\ngarden, because of higher quality of fruit than Concord, and under\r\nconditions well suited to it is better as a commercial variety, as the\r\nfruit is handsomer as well as of better quality. In the markets the\r\nfruit ought to sell for a higher price than Concord if desired for\r\nimmediate consumption, and if it can be harvested promptly, as it does\r\nnot hang well on the vines. Its earlier season is against it for a\r\ncommercial variety and, with the defects mentioned, will prevent its\r\ntaking the place of Concord to a great degree. Worden was originated\r\nby Schuyler Worden, Minetto, Oswego County, New York, from seed of\r\nConcord planted about 1863.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes large, thick,\r\n    dark brown with reddish tinge; nodes enlarged, flattened; tendrils\r\n    continuous, slender, bifid, sometimes trifid. Young leaves tinged\r\n    on the under side and along the margins of upper side with\r\n    rose-carmine. Leaves large, thick; upper surface dark green,\r\n    glossy, smooth; lower surface light bronze, pubescent; leaf\r\n    usually not lobed; petiolar sinus wide, often urn-shaped; teeth\r\n    shallow. Flowers fertile, mid-season; stamens upright.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early. Clusters large, long, broad, tapering, usually\r\n    single-shouldered, compact; pedicel slender with a few small\r\n    warts; brush long, light green. Berries large, round, dark\r\n    purplish-black, glossy with heavy bloom, firm; skin tender, cracks\r\n    badly, adheres slightly, contains dark red pigment, astringent.\r\n    Flesh green, translucent, juicy, fine-grained, tough, foxy, sweet,\r\n    mild; good to very good. Seeds adherent, one to five, large,\r\n    broad, short, blunt, brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING\r\n\r\n(Labrusca)\r\n\r\n_Hopkins Early Red, Wilmington Red, Wyoming Red_\r\n\r\nSuch value as Wyoming (Plate XXXII) possesses lies in the hardiness,\r\nproductiveness and healthiness of the vine. The appearance of the\r\nfruit is very good, the bunches are well formed and composed of rich\r\namber-colored berries of medium size. The quality, however, is poor,\r\nbeing that of the wild Labrusca in foxiness of flavor and in flesh\r\ncharacters. It is not nearly as valuable as some other of the red\r\nLabruscas hitherto described and can hardly be recommended either for\r\nthe garden or the vineyard. Wyoming was introduced by S. J. Parker of\r\nIthaca, New York, who states that it came from Pennsylvania in 1861.\r\n\r\n    Vine vigorous, hardy, healthy, productive. Canes numerous,\r\n    slender, dark reddish-brown covered with blue bloom; nodes\r\n    enlarged, frequently flattened; tendrils continuous, short, bifid.\r\n    Leaves of average size and thickness; upper surface light green,\r\n    dull, smooth; lower surface dull green with tinge of bronze,\r\n    pubescent; lobes one to three with terminus acute; petiolar sinus\r\n    shallow, wide; basal sinus usually wanting; lateral sinus shallow\r\n    and wide when present; teeth shallow. Flowers sterile, mid-season;\r\n    stamens reflexed.\r\n\r\n    Fruit early, keeps well. Clusters slender, cylindrical, compact;\r\n    pedicel short, slender with small warts; brush slender, pale green\r\n    with brown tinge. Berries medium, round, rich amber red with thin\r\n    bloom, persistent, firm; skin tender, adherent, astringent; flesh\r\n    pale green, translucent, juicy, tough, solid, strongly foxy,\r\n    vinous; poor in quality. Seeds adherent, one to three, slightly\r\n    notched, light brown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Bioletti, Frederic T. _Report of International Congress of\r\nViticulture_, 88. 1915.\r\n\r\n[2] Anthony, R.
