In fact it is impossible to study either\r\nwithout giving attention to the other two, and therefore, instead of\r\nbeing separate sciences, they are the three branches of a great\r\nscientific trinity.\r\n\r\nThe regions here referred to enjoy the advantage, and at the same time\r\nsuffer the disadvantage, of being comparatively little known to the ever\r\nrestless tide of tourists who naturally hail with pleasure the\r\nannouncement that some easily accessible, and thoroughly charming spot,\r\nhas escaped their attention altogether, with a marvelous store of\r\nattractions which are both extremely old and wholly new.\r\n\r\nEach of these regions has a peculiar geological history not repeated in\r\nany other portions of the earth's surface: each is blessed with its own\r\npeculiar style of beautiful scenery: and each vies with the other and\r\nall the world besides for the supremacy of its truly wonderful caves.\r\nYet it should be well understood that the claims are not based on an\r\nunworthy spirit of rivalry, nor any desire to deny the greatness and\r\nbeauty of already famous members of the Cave family. It is simply an\r\nannouncement that the family is much larger than has been generally\r\nsupposed, and the more recently presented members worthy of the full\r\nmeasure of distinguished honors.\r\n\r\nThe geological authorities of both states have for many years mentioned\r\nthe beauty and importance of these regions, and urged their claims to\r\npublic attention, but have been prevented, by the pressure of other\r\nduties, from giving to the caves such careful study and full reports as\r\nthey deserve, as it would have been a pleasure to give, and as has been\r\npossible in states of less extent where the general work of the\r\ndepartment is more advanced, and the volume of tourist travel created an\r\nearly demand for scientific explanation.\r\n\r\nWithout any great difficulty we can understand the process of cave\r\nexcavation by the action of percolating acidulated water on the\r\nlimestone, and its subsequent removal as the volume of surface drainage\r\ndiverted to the new channel gradually increased. But it is not so easy\r\nto offer a reason for the varied forms with which the caves are\r\nafterwards decorated. Why is it the charmed waters do not leave the\r\nevidence of their slow passage only in plain surfaces of varying widths,\r\nand the stalactites and stalagmites whose formation we can readily\r\naccount for? And why do not the deposits take the same forms in all\r\ncaves with only such variations as would naturally result from\r\ndifferences in topography? The law is written, but in unfamiliar\r\ncharacters that render our reading slow and uncertain. Yet it is\r\nconspicuously noticeable that those caves showing the most delicately\r\nfragile and wonderfully varied forms of decoration are those traversed\r\nby the most sweeping and changeable, or even reversible, currents of\r\nair; which might lead to the conclusion that the moisture is sprayed or\r\nconverted into a light, misty vapor, and then deposited in exactly the\r\nsame manner as the beautiful frost-work at Niagara: the direction and\r\nforce of the current determining the location of the frail deposits.\r\n\r\nSince the largest and most important caves occur in limestone, a little\r\nspecial attention to the cause of their occurrence there may serve to\r\nshow that although speleology has only recently received its name and\r\nbeen elevated to the rank of a separate and independent science, it is\r\none of the earth's ancient institutions.\r\n\r\nOur geologists, who have unearthed many secrets not dreamed of even in\r\nHumboldt's \"good phylosopy,\" have settled the question of how the\r\ndifferent kinds of caves were formed, according to the character of\r\nrocks they are in, or their location and depth, and the natural agencies\r\nto whose action they show signs of having been subjected.\r\n\r\nDr. H.C. Hovey, in his \"Celebrated American Caverns,\" says: \"In visiting\r\ncaves of large extent, one is at first inclined to regard the long\r\nhalls, huge rifts, deep pits and lofty domes, as evidences of great\r\nconvulsions of nature, whereby the earth has been violently rent\r\nasunder. But, while mechanical forces have had their share in the work,\r\nas has been shown, the main agent in every case has been the\r\ncomparatively gentle, invisible gas known as carbonic acid. This is\r\ngenerated by the decay of animal and vegetable substances, and is to a\r\nconsiderable degree soluble in water. Under ordinary circumstances one\r\nmeasure of water will absorb one measure of carbonic acid; and the eye\r\nwill detect no difference in its appearance. Under pressure the power of\r\nabsorption is rapidly increased, until the water thus surcharged has an\r\nacid taste, and effervesces on flowing from the earth, as in Saratoga\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\"Rain-water, falling amid leaves and grass, and sinking into the soil,\r\nabsorbs large quantities of carbonic acid. On reaching the underlying\r\nlimestone, the latter is instantly attacked by the acidulated water in\r\nwhich it is dissolved and carried away.\r\n\r\n\"It is agreed among geologists, amazing as the statement may seem, that\r\nthe immense caverns of Virginia, Kentucky and Indiana, including Mammoth\r\nCave itself (the largest of all), were eaten out of the solid mass of\r\nlimestone by the slow, patient, but irresistible action of acidulated\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor N.S. Shaler says: \"The existence of deep caverns is a sign\r\nthat the region has long been above the sea.\"\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Professor C.J. Norwood, Chief Inspector and\r\nCurator of the Geological Department of Kentucky, it is possible to\r\nquote the first official report made on the caves of that state and\r\npublished in 1856, in Volume I., Kentucky Geological Survey Reports.\r\nDr. Norwood says: \"Referring to the 'Subcarboniferous Limestone' (now\r\nknown as the St. Louis group of the Mississippian series), Dr. Owen\r\nsays: 'The southern belt of this formation is wonderfully cavernous,\r\nespecially in its upper beds, which being more argillaceous, and\r\nimpregnated with earths and alkalies, are disposed to produce salts,\r\nwhich oozing through the pores of the stone effloresce on its surface,\r\nand thus tend to disintegrate and scale off, independent of the solvent\r\neffects of the carbonated water. Beneath overhanging ledges of\r\nlimestone, quantities of fine earthy rubbish can be seen, weathered off\r\nfrom such causes. In these I have detected sulphate of lime, sulphate of\r\nmagnesia, nitrate of lime, and occasionally sulphate of soda. The\r\ntendency which some calcareous rocks have to produce nitrate of lime is,\r\nprobably, one of the greatest causes of disintegration.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Most extensive subterranean areas thus have been excavated or\r\nundermined in Edmonson, Hart, Grayson, Butler, Logan, Todd, Christian\r\nand Trig. In the vicinity of Green River, in the first of these\r\ncounties, the known avenues of the Mammoth Cave amount to two hundred\r\nand twenty-three, the united length of the whole being estimated, by\r\nthose best acquainted with the Cave, at one hundred and fifty miles; say\r\nthat the average width and height of these passages amount to seven\r\nyards each way, which is perhaps near the truth; this would give upwards\r\nof twelve million cubic yards of cavernous space which has been\r\nexcavated through the agency of calcareous waters and atmospheric\r\nvicissitudes.\"\r\n\r\nPage 169: \"On the south side of Green River the platform of limestone\r\nforming the descent into Mammoth Cave is two hundred and thirty-two feet\r\nabove Green River.\"\r\n\r\n\"The entrance to the cave, being thirty-eight feet lower than this bed\r\nof limestone, is one hundred and ninety-four feet above Green River. In\r\nthe above two hundred and thirty-two feet there are several heavy masses\r\nof sandstone, viz.: at one hundred and twenty-five, one hundred and\r\nforty-five, one hundred and fifty, one hundred and sixty and two hundred\r\nand fifteen feet, but it is probable that most of these have tumbled\r\nfrom higher positions in the hill, as no alterations of sandstone have\r\nbeen observed at these levels in the cave. From an elevation of from two\r\nhundred and forty to two hundred and fifty feet, the prevalent rock is\r\nsandstone without pebbles, which can be seen extending up to three\r\nhundred and twelve feet to the foundation of the Cave Hotel. The united\r\nthickness of the limestone beds on this part of Green River, is about\r\ntwo hundred and thirty feet, capped with eighty feet of sandstone.\r\nAbout midway of the section on this part of Green River, are limestones\r\nof an obscure oolitic structure, but no true oolite was observed. Many\r\nof these limestones are of such composition as to be acted on freely by\r\nthe elements of the atmosphere, which, in the form of nitric acid,\r\ncombine with the earthy and alkaline bases of calcareous rock, and give\r\nrise to the formation of nitrates with the liberation of carbonic acid;\r\nhence the disintegrated rubbish of the caves yields nitrate of potash\r\nafter being treated with the ley of ashes and subsequent evaporation of\r\nthe saline lixivium. The wonderfully cavernous character of the\r\nsubcarboniferous limestones of the Green River valley, and, indeed, of\r\nthese particular members of the subcarboniferous group throughout a\r\ngreat part of its range in Kentucky and Indiana, is due in a great\r\nmeasure to this cause, together with the solvent and eroding effects of\r\nwater charged with carbonic acid. The 'rock-houses' frequently\r\nencountered both in this formation and in the limestones of Silurian\r\ndate, are produced by similar causes; the more easily disintegrated beds\r\ngradually crumbling away, while the more durable remain in overhanging\r\nledges. By the oxidation of other elements, sulphates of oxide of iron\r\nand alkalies result, which, by double decomposition, with carbonate of\r\nlime, give rise to the formation of gypsums which appears in the form of\r\nrosettes, festoons and various other imitative forms on the walls and\r\nceilings of the caves. Crystallizations of sulphate of soda and sulphate\r\nof magnesia are not uncommon, both in some of the caves and in sheltered\r\nsituations under shelving rocks.\"\r\n\r\nThe explanations thus given of the excavation and subsequent refilling\r\nand decoration of the limestone caves of Kentucky and Indiana apply\r\nequally well to those of other states; but it is to be remembered that\r\nat the time of Dr. Owen's report, onyx, the most beautiful and valuable\r\nof dripstones, had not yet been discovered in the United States; while\r\nnow especially fine deposits are known in California, Utah, Missouri,\r\nSouth Dakota and Arkansas; the Missouri supply being exceptionally\r\nvaluable on account of the marvelous delicacy and beauty of its\r\ncoloring; nor can it soon be exhausted, as deposits have been found in\r\neight counties and further exploration will no doubt discover more.\r\n\r\nConcerning the Subcarboniferous, or Mississippian Series in Part I.,\r\nVol. IV., Missouri Geological Survey, Dr. C.R. Keyes says: \"In the great\r\ninterior basin of the Mississippi the basal series is exposed more or\r\nless continuously over broad areas, extending from northern Iowa to\r\nAlabama, and from Ohio to Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this broadly extended series of limestone is honey-combed in many\r\nplaces and all directions by wonderful caverns, those of the Ozark\r\nregions in Missouri, although comparatively little known, are well worth\r\nknowing, and are possibly the most ancient limestone caves in the world.\r\nOf the region in which they occur, Dr. Keyes, in the volume last quoted,\r\nsays: \"The chief typographical feature of the state has long been known\r\nin the Ozark uplift, a broad plateau with gentle quaquaversal slopes\r\nrising to a height of more than one thousand five hundred feet above\r\nmean tide, and extending almost entirely across the southern part of the\r\ndistrict. On all sides the borders of this highland area are deeply\r\ngrooved by numberless streams flowing in narrow gorges. Against its\r\nnucleus of very ancient granites and porphyries the Ozark series of\r\nmagnesian limestone was laid down. Then the area occupied by these rocks\r\nwas elevated, and around its margins were deposited successively the\r\nother members of the Paleozoic. The Ozark region was thus the first land\r\nto appear within the borders of the present state of Missouri.\" He\r\nfurther says: \"Although it has long been known that the Magnesian\r\nLimestones are older than the Trenton, and that they lie immediately\r\nupon and against the Archæan crystallines unconformably, their exact\r\ngeological age has always remained unsettled. There seems to be but\r\nlittle doubt, however, that part of the series is equivalent to the\r\nCalciferous of other regions. It is also pretty well determined that\r\ncertain of the lower beds, all below the 'Saccharoidal' Sandstone\r\nperhaps, are representatives of the Upper Cambrian or Potsdam. These\r\nconclusions appear well grounded both upon stratigraphical and faunal\r\nevidence. The rocks of the Ozark region have not as yet received the\r\nnecessary detailed study to enable the several lines of demarkation to\r\nbe drawn with certainty. This investigation is now being carried on as\r\nrapidly as possible, and promises very satisfactory and interesting\r\nresults in the near future.\"\r\n\r\n\"The early geological reports represent the Magnesian Limestone series\r\nas made up of seven members. Following Swallow, these may be briefly\r\ndescribed in the present connection. Beginning at the top, they are:\r\n\r\nFirst Magnesian Limestone.\r\nFirst, or Saccharoidal Sandstone.\r\nSecond Magnesian Limestone.\r\nSecond Sandstone.\r\nThird Magnesian Limestone.\r\nThird Sandstone.\r\nFourth Limestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Fourth\" Magnesian Limestone, or lowest number of the Ozark series\r\nrecognized, has its typical exposures along the Niangua and Osage rivers\r\nin Morgan and Camden counties.\r\n\r\nProfessor Swallow, in his Missouri Geological Survey Reports I. and II.,\r\n1853 and 1854, says: \"Caves, natural bridges and subterranean streams\r\noccur in the valley of the Osage and its tributaries.\" The same\r\nauthority of forty years ago also mentions that \"Some of the grandest\r\nscenery in the State is produced by the high castellated and mural\r\nbluffs of this (Third Magnesian Limestone) Formation, on the Niangua and\r\nthe Osage.\" Another reference to the scenery on these rivers describes\r\nit as \"Wild and grand, beautiful and unique;\" with \"gaudy-colored\r\nbluffs.\" In the section on building materials he remarks: \"One of the\r\nmost desirable of the Missouri marbles is in the Third Magnesian\r\nLimestone on the Niangua. It is fine-grained, crystalline,\r\nsilico-magnesian limestone of a light drab, slightly tinged with\r\npeach-blossom, and beautifully clouded with the same hue or flesh color.\r\nIt is twenty feet thick and crops out in the bluffs. This marble is\r\nrarely surpassed in the qualities which fit it for ornamental\r\narchitecture.\"\r\n\r\nThe Ozarks in the extreme southern portion of the state are even less\r\nknown to the world, but the scenery is grand, the climate delightful,\r\nand the caves worthy of a visit for themselves alone. The State of\r\nMissouri being one third larger than England, and of equal size to\r\nSwitzerland, Holland, Belgium and Denmark combined, it is not surprising\r\nthat interesting discoveries are still to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe climate is so varied on account of the range in latitude and\r\naltitude, and the natural resources are so great, the claim has been\r\nmade that if the State were surrounded by an impassable wall, its\r\ncitizens need not be deprived of any article necessary to a refined and\r\nluxurious mode of living: and according to Mr. Henry Gannett in \"The\r\nBuilding of a Nation,\" the population in 1890 was 73.42 per cent. native\r\nwhites of native parents, the colored a little less than 6 per cent.,\r\nand nearly two-thirds of the balance, native born of parents, one or\r\nboth of whom were foreign.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Ozark region has not yet received sufficient attention to\r\ndull its charm for the explorer, the fact has been established that its\r\nearliest sedimentary rocks are of the Cambrian Age and still occupy\r\nmainly the position in which they were originally deposited. Therefore\r\nwe need not be surprised to discover that some, at least, of the\r\nexcavations are proportionately ancient; and that the Natural Bridges\r\nare the last remaining positive evidence of their former existence and\r\nfinal collapse. That the Natural Bridges of Missouri mark the\r\ndestruction of more ancient caves than the one preserved to geological\r\nhistory by Virginia's grand attraction, seems quite evident. The greater\r\nage of the rocks indicates the possibility of earlier excavation while\r\ntheir undisturbed position suggests that destruction resulted, not from\r\nviolent earth movement, but from the slow action of agencies requiring\r\nlong periods of time.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to a discussion of the caves visited personally for\r\nthe gratification of private interest, it is desirable to know what\r\nattention has been given to the subject, incidentally, in the course of\r\nregular official duty on the Missouri Geological Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVES DESCRIBED IN THE STATE REPORTS.\r\n\r\nAlthough many unknown caves must yet be discovered in the imperfectly\r\nexplored portions of the vast Ozark forests, these finds are already so\r\nnumerous as to seldom attract attention according to their just\r\ndesserts.\r\n\r\nOne of the comparatively recent of these discoveries is Crystal Cave, at\r\nJoplin, described on page 566, Vol. VII., Missouri Geological Survey\r\nReport 1894.[1] It was opened in the lower workings of a shaft of the\r\nEmpire Zinc Company, and \"The entire surface of the cave, top, sides and\r\nbottom, is lined with calcite crystals, so closely packed together as\r\nto form a continuous sheet and most of them of great size, and well\r\nformed faces. Scalenohedra as much as two feet long are sometimes seen,\r\nand others a foot or more in length are common. Planes or crystal\r\nghosts, sometimes with pyrite crystals, marking stages of growth in the\r\ncalcite crystals, are often distinguishable. The entire absence of\r\nanything like stalactites is noticeable, and together with the presence\r\nof the crystals, show that the cave was completely filled with water\r\nduring their growth.\" In the same volume, all those counties in the\r\nextreme southwest corner of the state, whose geological age has not\r\nheretofore been considered positively determined, are mapped as Lower\r\nCarboniferous, and Lower Silurian, with the Coal Measures covering\r\nportions of Barton and Jasper and appearing in a few small, scattered\r\nspots in Dade, Polk, Green and Christian counties, and some scanty lines\r\nof Devonian fringing the edges of the Silurian in Barton and McDonald.\r\n\r\nOther State reports make mention of many caves and fine springs, and\r\nalso several natural bridges worthy of special notice. In Mr. G.C.\r\nBroadhead's report for 1873-1874, he gives a short but interesting\r\nchapter on caves and water supplies, in which he says that \"Caves occur\r\nin the Third Magnesian Limestone, Saccharoidal Sandstone, Trenton,\r\nLithographic, Encrinital and St. Louis Limestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Eastern and Northeast Missouri there have not been found many large\r\ncaves in the Encrinital Limestone, but the lower beds of this formation\r\nin Southwest Missouri often enclose very large caverns; among the latter\r\nmay be included the caves of Green County with some in Christian and\r\nMcDonald. Those in McDonald I have not seen, but they are reported to be\r\nvery extensive and probably are situated in the Encrinital Limestone.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Special Descriptions\" he says: \"On Sac River, in the\r\nnorth part of Green County, we find a cave with two entrances, one at\r\nthe foot of a hill, opening toward Sac River, forty-five feet high and\r\neighty feet wide. The other entrance is from the hill-top, one hundred\r\nand fifty feet back from the face of the bluff. These two passages\r\nunite. The exact dimensions of the cave are not known, but there are\r\nseveral beautiful and large rooms lined with stalactites and stalagmites\r\nwhich often assume both beautiful and grotesque life-like forms. The\r\ncave has been explored for several hundred yards, showing the formations\r\nto be thick silicious beds of the Lower Carboniferous formations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Knox cave, in Green County, is said to be of large dimensions. I have\r\nnot seen it, but some of its stalactites are quite handsome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wilson's Creek sinks beneath the Limestone and appears again below.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are several caves near Ozark, Christian County, which issue from\r\nthe same formation as those in Green County. On a branch of Finly Creek\r\na stream disappears in a sink, appearing again three-quarters of a mile\r\nsoutheast through an opening sixty feet high by ninety-eight feet wide.\r\nUp stream the cave continues this size for a hundred yards and then\r\ndecreases in size, and for the next quarter of a mile further it is\r\ngenerally ten by fourteen feet wide. A very clear, cool stream passes\r\nout, in which by careful search crawfish without eyes can be found.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is another cave a few miles south of Ozark, and another ten miles\r\nsoutheast occurs in the Magnesian Limestone.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Boone County there are several caves in the Encrinital Limestone.\r\nConner's, the largest, is said to have been explored for a distance of\r\neight miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"In Pike and Lincoln there are several small caves occurring in the\r\nupper beds of Trenton Limestone, which are often very cavernous. On\r\nSulphur Fork of Cuivre, there is a cave and Natural Bridge, to which\r\nparties for pleasure often resort. The bridge is tubular with twenty\r\nfeet between the walls, and is one hundred feet long.\"\r\n\r\n\"At J.P. Fisher's on Spencer Creek, Ralls County, there is a cave having\r\nan entrance of ninety feet wide by twenty feet high. The Lower Trenton\r\nbeds occupy the floor, with the upper cavernous beds above. On the\r\nbluff, at a distance of one hundred and fifty yards back, there is a\r\nsink-hole which communicates with the cave. Within the cave is a cool,\r\nclear spring of water, and Mr. F. said he could keep meat fresh there\r\nfor six weeks during midsummer.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Third Magnesian Limestone which occupies such a large portion of\r\nSouthwest Missouri, often contains very large caves. One of them, known\r\nas Friede's cave, is six or eight miles Northwest of Rolla, on Cave\r\nSpring Creek.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is said to have been explored for several miles, but I only passed\r\nin a few hundred yards. The stalactites here are very beautiful,\r\nassuming the structure of satin spar. A very clear stream of water\r\nissues out. West of the Gasconade, on Clifty Creek, is a remarkable\r\nNatural Bridge which I have elsewhere described in Geological Survey of\r\nMissouri, 1855-71, page 16.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Meek speaks of a large and interesting cave on Tavern Creek, in\r\nMiller County. Dr. Shumard estimates a cave on Bryant's Fork, in Ozark\r\nCounty, to be a mile and a half long.\"\r\n\r\nThis description of Dr. Shumard's is in the Geological Survey of\r\nMissouri, 1855-71, page 196, where he says:\r\n\r\n\"The entrance is thirty-five feet wide and thirty feet high, and is\r\nsituated at the foot of a perpendicular cliff, and far above the\r\nwater-level of Bryant. Just within the entrance it expands to sixty or\r\nseventy feet, with a height of about fifty feet; and this part of the\r\ncave has been used by the citizens of the county as a place for holding\r\ncamp-meeting. I estimated its length at not far short of one mile and a\r\nhalf. The main passage is in general quite spacious, the roof elevated,\r\nand the floor tolerably level, but often wet and miry. For some distance\r\nbeyond the entrance there is not much to attract attention; but as we\r\nproceed, at the far extremity the chambers are quite as picturesque as\r\nthe most noted of the well-known Mammoth Cave. The ceilings, sides and\r\nfloor are adorned with a multitude of stalactites and stalagmites\r\narranged in fanciful combinations, and assuming a variety of fantastic\r\nand beautiful forms.\"\r\n\r\nMany of these caves contain niter, which occurs as a mineral and not as\r\nevidence of former animal occupation, it being found in the form of\r\neffervescenses on the walls. Dr. Shumard mentions several of this\r\ncharacter in Pulaski County, the most noted being Niter Cave, in the\r\nThird Magnesian Limestone, with a wide entrance thirty feet above the\r\nlevel of the Gasconade. On page 201, he also gives a charming\r\ndescription of one of the immense springs that are numerous in this\r\nregion and that I have never seen elsewhere. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Ozark County is bountifully supplied with springs of the finest water,\r\nand some of them of remarkably large size. The largest one is situated\r\nnear the North Fork, in T. 24, R. 11 W., Sec. 32, and is known under the\r\nname of the Double Spring. It issues from near the base of a bluff of\r\nSandstone and Magnesian Limestone, a few feet above the level of the\r\nNorth Fork. This spring discharges an immense volume of water, which is\r\ndivided by a huge mass of Sandstone into two streams, with swift\r\ncurrents flowing in opposite directions to join the North Fork about one\r\nhundred and fifty yards distant from the spring. I estimated the width\r\nof these streams at not less than fifty yards. They are separated from\r\nthe North Fork by a pretty wooded island one hundred yards long. The\r\nupper stream affords a good mill-site. I am informed that the quantity\r\nof water discharged by this magnificent spring is not materially\r\ndiminished during the dryest seasons of the year. The temperature of the\r\nwater measured at the edge of the spring, was found to be 56°; the\r\ntemperature of the air at the same time, 59°. Other springs of\r\nconsiderable magnitude occur in various portions of the county, giving\r\nrise to beautiful and limpid streams.\"\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of the Natural Bridge and Friede's cave, near Rolla,\r\npreviously referred to as being on page 16 of the same volume, are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"On Clifty Creek found the chert bed of Sec. 21-5 occurring about sixty\r\nfeet from the top of the Third Magnesian Limestone, with a road passing\r\nover its upper surface, presenting it very favorably for observation. It\r\nseemed here to be broken by vertical cracks into large rhomboidal\r\nblocks. Further up this creek in a wild and secluded spot, observed a\r\nNatural Bridge with six feet of this chert bed at its base, and\r\nSilicious Magnesian Limestone above. The span of this bridge is about\r\nthirty feet, an elevation of opening about fifteen feet above the water,\r\nthe thickness of the rock above is about twelve feet, and width on top\r\nabout fifteen feet. Two small streams come together, one from the west\r\nand another from the south-west. A point of the bluff on the south-west\r\nfork spans the northern fork, and terminates about sixty feet beyond in\r\na sharp point; a few large masses of rock lie near the termination of\r\nthe promontory, and fifty feet beyond, the bluffs of the opposite hills\r\nrise abruptly from the bottoms. The bluffs, both above and below, are\r\nvery precipitous, the middle and lower beds of the Third Magnesian\r\nLimestone forming perpendicular escarpments, frequently studded with\r\ncedar, some occurring on top of the bridge. A perfectly clear stream of\r\nwater courses through this valley. The bottoms near are overspread with\r\na dense growth of trees and vines, among which latter I noticed the\r\nMuscadine grape. The valley at this part being shut in by its\r\nperpendicular cliffs with not a path to guide the traveler through the\r\ndense thickets, is wildly picturesque and romantic in its loneliness.\"\r\n\r\nOf the cave he says: \"This cave is a quarter of a mile east of Cave\r\nSpring Creek, and has a wide and elevated entrance; passing into it a\r\nhundred yards or more, the passage narrows, and in order to go further a\r\nstream of water has frequently to be waded through; this passage has\r\nbeen followed by some persons several miles without finding any object\r\nof interest; but a few hundred yards from the entrance, by diverging to\r\nthe right, we enter a large chamber, studded with stalactites and\r\nstalagmites, many uniting and forming solid columns of support. Many of\r\nthese are very beautiful, and often as white as alabaster. There are\r\nother large rooms, but they possess no peculiar interest. Found large\r\ndeposits of earth on the floor having a saline taste.\"\r\n\r\nOf the extensive pine forests in Ozark County, he says: \"The size and\r\nquality of the timber will compare favorably with that of the\r\ncelebrated pineries of Wisconsin and Minnesota.\"\r\n\r\nIn several other counties the pine is equally good, and other valuable\r\ntimber everywhere abundant, although in a school geography published in\r\n1838, the following descriptions of this region occur:\r\n\r\n\"The lowlands of the Mississippi are bounded by the region of the Ozark\r\nMountains. With the exception of the alluvial tracts on the borders of\r\nthe streams, it is extremely hilly and broken. The mountains rise from\r\neight hundred to eighteen hundred feet above the streams, with rounded\r\nsummits and often perpendicular cliffs, and have a rocky surface, which\r\nadmits only a scanty growth of timber.\" * *\r\n\r\n\"Missouri is generally a region of prairies and table lands, much of\r\nwhich, as already described, is almost destitute of timber and water. It\r\nis crossed by the Ozark Mountains, which form a rugged tract of\r\nconsiderable extent. Earthquakes are not infrequent in some parts of\r\nthis state. The soil is not generally productive.\"\r\n\r\nA comparison of these curious views with the latest official reports is\r\nhighly amusing, as well as suggestive that early impressions are liable\r\nto require modification.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the wonderful springs of pure water, there are numerous\r\nfine mineral springs, among which are a number of Epsom salt springs.\r\nAt Jacksonville, in Randolph County, there is a large mineral spring\r\nfrom which it is said an over-heated horse may drink all he will without\r\ninjury. Epsom-salts, or Epsomite, frequently occurs, as does the Niter,\r\nin a crystalline form of the pure mineral, as an efflorescence on rocks\r\nin many of the caves and in other sheltered positions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Surveyed Portions of Marble Cave Stone County\r\nMissouri\r\n\r\nSurveyed and Plotted by Fred Prince. 1894\r\n\r\nScale of 100 feet]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Lead and Zinc. Prof. C.R. Keyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nMARBLE CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMarble Cave, which is the finest yet explored in Missouri, is southeast\r\nof the center of Stone County, a short distance north of the picturesque\r\nWhite River. The nearest station is Marionville on the St. Louis and San\r\nFrancisco railroad, and the drive of forty miles is delightful, but can\r\nbe divided, into two of twenty each by a stop at Galena. The road, for\r\nthe most part, is naturally macadamized and is through a most charming\r\ncountry whose roughness and beauty increase together as the journey\r\nadvances. At first it winds along fertile valleys between wooded hills,\r\ncrossing many times a shallow stream of water so clear as to afford no\r\nconcealment for an occasional water-moccasin, whose bite is said to be\r\nnot poisonous if inflicted under water, and which must be true because\r\nthe horses showed not the least uneasiness.\r\n\r\nThe second week in May found the vegetation in its summer beauty;\r\nstrawberries were ripe, and the weather without a fault.\r\n\r\nGalena is pleasantly situated on the hills overlooking the James River,\r\nand is entirely invisible from the road by which it is approached until\r\na slight curve in the line of ascent ends the first half of the journey\r\nwith surprising suddenness. In the immediate vicinity there are several\r\nsmall caves which are worthy of attention and will be described later\r\non.\r\n\r\nTo properly picture the twenty miles of changing and charming views\r\nbetween Galena and Marble Cave would require the light and skillful\r\ntouch of a special artist gifted with a tangible perception of\r\natmospheric values. Gradually the road forsakes the pretty valleys with\r\ntheir fields and streams, to take the summit of the hills and then be\r\nknown as the \"Ridge Road,\" which affords a wide range of vision not\r\npreviously enjoyed, presenting scenes not to be found reproduced\r\nelsewhere with any degree of exactness. Looking into the depth of the\r\nforest as it slopes away on either side, the impression is of a\r\nmagnificent park, undefaced by what are called improvements. This effect\r\nis produced by the scarcity, or entire absence of underbrush, and a\r\nbeautiful surface covering of grasses or flowering plants of all kinds\r\nand colors, varied here and there with masses of ferns of unusual size\r\nand delicate beauty. The most unexpected and lavish feature of the rich\r\ndisplay is the many miles of fragrant honeysuckle that grows only\r\neighteen inches high in the forest shade, but if transplanted to a sunny\r\nspot develops into the familiar vine. The most beautiful portion of\r\nall this is called The Wilderness, and seems designed for a National\r\nPark. Such a park reserve, even if very small, could not fail to be a\r\nlasting pleasure, since it would be more accessible to large centers of\r\npopulation than other reserves, and its most delightful seasons are\r\nspring and autumn when the Yellowstone is under snow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Mill-Site Near Marble Cave.]\r\n\r\nThe distant view obtained through open spaces is an undulating forest in\r\nall directions, being apparently both trackless and endless. The great\r\nvariety of greens observed in the foliage blends in the distance into\r\none dark shade, then changes to dark blue, which gradually fades out to\r\na hazy uncertainty where it is lost at the sky-line.\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1853, the variety and abundance of the natural growth of\r\nfruits throughout the Ozarks was observed by Professor Swallow, who then\r\nadvised the planting of vines.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Wilderness is the Marble Cave property and the entrance to\r\nthe Cave is through a large sink-hole in the top of Roark Mountain. This\r\nhole is said to be about two hundred feet long, one hundred feet wide\r\nand thirty-five feet deep. It is shaped like a great oblong bowl with\r\nsloping sides, divided irregularly near the middle, and having the\r\nbottom broken out in a jagged way that is very handsome and gives an\r\nample support to the growth of ferns, wild roses, and other vegetation\r\nwith which it is abundantly decorated. About half of the descent into\r\nthe basin is accomplished by scrambling down the roughly broken rocks,\r\nand the balance by a broad wooden stairway ending at a narrow platform\r\nthat supports the locked gate.\r\n\r\nFor kind and valuable assistance rendered to insure the success and\r\npleasure of the visit to the wonderful cave, which they regard with\r\naffection and pride, very cordial thanks are due to Capt. T.S. Powell,\r\nformer manager, his son, Mr. Will Powell, the first guide, and Mr. Fred\r\nPrince, who has made the only official survey and map. It may be stated\r\nhere that the survey and map are far from complete, and many known\r\npassages have never yet been entered.\r\n\r\nBeing the first visiting party of the season, certain disadvantages were\r\nencountered in a great accumulation of wet clay and rubbish, washed in\r\nby the rains since the previous summer; but the gate was opened with\r\nconsiderable effort, and slowly and cautiously we descended the\r\nslippery, clay-banked stairs to the immense mound of debris forty-five\r\nfeet below the gate, to behold, at last, the grandeur of the Auditorium.\r\n\r\nThe magnificence of that one chamber should give to Marble Cave a\r\nworld-wide fame even if there were nothing more beyond. The blue-gray\r\nlimestone walls have a greater charm than those of an open cañon, owing\r\nto the fact that they sweep away from any given point in long, true\r\ncurves to form an elliptical chamber three hundred and fifty feet long\r\nby one hundred and twenty-five feet wide, with the vault above showing\r\nabsolute perfection of arch, and measuring, by the survey, from its\r\nlowest to its highest point, one hundred and ninety-five feet. These\r\nmeasurements are said to be indisputably correct, and if so, the\r\nAuditorium of Marble Cave is the largest unsupported, perfect arch in\r\nthe world; it being one hundred feet longer than the famous Mormon\r\nTabernacle at Salt Lake City. In addition to the artistic superiority of\r\narchitectural form, its acoustic properties having been tested, it is\r\nfound to be truly an auditorium. The curving walls and pure atmosphere\r\ncombine to aid the voice, and carry its softest tones with marvelous\r\ndistinctness to every portion of the immense inclosed space. As a\r\nconcert hall its capacity has been tested by musicians who are said to\r\nhave been enthusiastic over the success of their experiments. Several\r\nyears ago a piano was lowered into the cave for use on a special\r\noccasion, and still occupies a position on the dancing platform, where\r\nit will probably remain indefinitely under the scant protection of a\r\nsmall canvas tent.\r\n\r\nThe chief ornament of the Auditorium is the White Throne, a stalagmitic\r\nmass that when viewed from the stairway appears to rest solidly against\r\nthe most distant wall, and looks so small an object in that vast space\r\nas to render a realization of its actual measurement impossible. The\r\nheight of the Throne is sixty-five feet and the girth two hundred. It is\r\na mass of dripstone resting on a limestone base reserved from the\r\nancient excavation to receive it, and on careful inspection the\r\nperpendicular lines, observed on the front, are found to be a set of\r\nrather large organ pipes. A fresh fracture shows the Throne to be a most\r\nbeautiful white and gold onyx. The outer surface has now received a thin\r\ncoating of yellow clay which was, of course, regretted, but later\r\nobservations on onyx building reveals the pleasing fact that if the\r\ncrystal-bearing waters continue to drip, the yellow clay will supply the\r\ncoloring matter for a golden band of crystal.\r\n\r\nThe Throne is hollow and has a natural opening in one side by which it\r\nmay be entered, but the space within is too limited to invite a lengthy\r\nstay. That portion of the outside which is nearest the wall is formed\r\nwith sufficient irregularity of outline to admit of an ascent to the\r\ntop, and the view obtained is well worth the difficult scramble up and\r\nthe apprehensive slide down. Being raised so high above all objects that\r\ndivide attention or in some degree obstruct the view, permits a freedom\r\nof outlook that sensibly increases the appreciation of the vastness of\r\nthe enclosed chamber and its enclosing walls. Efforts to establish the\r\nage of the deposit by observations on the yearly growth, would afford\r\nlittle satisfaction, for the obvious reason that conditions governing\r\nthe growth are dependent, in a measure, on each season's vegetation.\r\nDeposit began, of course, after the erosion of the chamber ceased, and\r\ntherefore represents only a fraction of the age of the cave itself.\r\nAbout thirty feet west of the White Throne and against the wall, stands\r\nthe next onyx attraction in the form of a beautiful fluted column nearly\r\ntwenty feet high, tapering up from a base three feet in diameter, and\r\nknown as the Spring Room Sentinel, because the Spring of Youth is just\r\nbehind it although not directly connected with the Auditorium; it being\r\nthe first chamber on the left in Total Depravity Passage, a wet and\r\ndangerous way of which next to nothing is known, but the entrance to\r\nwhich is a fine arch a few feet west of the Sentinel. The Spring of\r\nYouth is reached by climbing through a window-like opening, and is very\r\nsmall, very wet, very cold, and very beautiful. It is not more than ten\r\nfeet high nor six in its greatest length and breadth, but every inch of\r\nits irregular surface is composed of dripstone of a bright yellowish-red\r\nand colorless crystal; and down the glittering walls trickles clear and\r\nalmost ice-cold water, to the onyx floor where it is caught and held in\r\na marvelous fluted bowl of its own manufacture. This is said to be the\r\ngem of the whole cave and seems to have been placed where it is for the\r\nconsolation of those who are unable to enjoy the peculiar grandeur of\r\nthe Auditorium, and leave it as some actually are said to do, with a\r\nsense of disappointment, because it is not the gleaming white hall of\r\nmarble which some writers for reputable journals have allowed their\r\nimaginations to create.\r\n\r\nIn winter the Spring of Youth Room takes on a complete coating of ice,\r\nwith icicles of all sizes hanging from the ceiling and projections. The\r\neffect is described as being wonderfully beautiful.\r\n\r\nFurther down Total Depravity Passage we were not urged to go, because at\r\nthat season of the year it is wet and difficult, without any sufficient\r\npromise of a brilliant compensation for the achievement of such a\r\njourney. But the Spring of Youth Room, or as it is generally called, the\r\nSpring Room, is more than ample justification for the existence of the\r\npassage, and would still be if that passage were several miles in length\r\nand the attraction located at the most distant limit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wall in Spring Room. Page 32.]\r\n\r\nThe various passages in Marble Cave are by no means alike or even\r\nsimilar; some having been opened by the action of water assisted only by\r\nacid carried in solution; while others are the unmistakable crevices of\r\nearthquake origin, afterwards enlarged, or perhaps only remodeled, as we\r\nmight say, by the water's untiring energy in changing the position of\r\nrock masses without obliterating evidences of original design.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map shows the sudden breaking off of the various\r\npassages represented; the end, however, is not of the passages\r\nthemselves, but only of the exploration or the survey of them, and there\r\nis a possibility that future developments will lead to the discovery of\r\nmore caves than are yet known. However that may be, the glimpses already\r\nhad into the beyond are said to be alluring.\r\n\r\nTo the north of the Auditorium, which was until recently called the\r\nGrand Amphitheater, there opens out a kind of alcove extension known as\r\nthe Mother Hubbard Room, and spreading out from this is the corridor, a\r\nroom about one hundred and twenty-five feet long and seventy-five feet\r\nin width, with a low, narrow passage, or crawl, leading from the\r\nnortheast into the Grotto, a dome-shaped room formerly called the\r\nBattery, on account of the great number of bats that used to congregate\r\nin it. It is about forty feet in diameter and fifty feet in height. On\r\none side of this room is a narrow \"squeeze\" opening into a passage\r\nseveral feet lower than the floor level of the Grotto and leading to the\r\nSpanish Room, which when discovered bore indications of having been\r\noccupied by a human being who had tried to escape by tunneling, or by\r\nreaching a hole in the roof; which is said to be impossible for him to\r\nhave done without outside assistance. As no bones have been found we may\r\nhope the assistance arrived in time. When the discovery of the room was\r\nmade, a quantity of loose rock was piled before the entrance, so if he\r\never escaped it was not by that way.\r\n\r\nAfter crawling back to the Corridor, through the same small, but dry\r\npassage of seventy feet length, we saw a narrow ledge of fine crystals,\r\na deposit of Epsom salts, and a few bats that in the dim light looked\r\nwhite but are a light tan color with brown wings. A good specimen\r\nhanging on a projecting ledge of the wall remained undisturbed by us and\r\nour lights, giving an opportunity for careful inspection so that we\r\npresently discovered it to be a mummy; which naturally suggests that\r\nthis portion of the cave, being dry and opening out of the great\r\ntemple-like Auditorium as an alcove, could be converted into an imposing\r\ncrypt.\r\n\r\nMaking our way across the room to its southwest extremity over a varied\r\nassortment of bowlders and down a drop of eight or ten feet, we crawled\r\ninto another tight-fitting dry passage lined with beautiful glittering\r\nonyx like clear ice banded with narrow lines of red, of which broken\r\nfragments covered the narrow floor and made a dazzling, but\r\ndistressingly painful rug to crawl over. This is the West Passage and\r\nleads to the Grand Crevice, of which only a small portion has been\r\nsurveyed; midway of the passage are the Epsom Rooms, two in number, and\r\nwell supplied with epsomite or native Epsom salts; this is sometimes\r\ncalled the Windy Passage, on account of a rushing current of air met\r\nsuddenly at the first bend and, no doubt, due to the meeting here of\r\nfresh air coming in from the outside with that chemically changed in the\r\nEpsom Rooms.\r\n\r\nThe cave contains a great many dangerous places, as we correctly\r\nsurmised on the morning of our introduction; when Mr. Powell's blessing\r\non the breakfast was lost in so fervent a prayer for the safe and\r\nsuccessful accomplishment of our undertaking, it seemed inconsiderate\r\nnot to present the reassuring appearance of inexhaustible endurance.\r\n\r\nIn the Corridor can be seen one of the three old Spanish ladders found\r\nin the cave when it was rediscovered; but when and for what purpose the\r\nSpaniards used the cave there seems to be no means of finding out. It\r\nshould be remembered that this part of the United States was occupied\r\nfirst by the Spaniards and then by the French, and is a portion of the\r\nLouisiana Purchase, a tract of 897,931 square miles, or 70,000 square\r\nmiles more than the original thirteen states. The price asked and paid\r\nwas $12,000,000 and the assumption of claims which citizens of this\r\ncountry had against the French Government for about $3,750,000 more. The\r\nFrench offered to make the sale on account of being thoroughly\r\ndiscouraged with constant troubles arising with the Indians, whom they\r\nhad decided it would be impossible to persuade or compel to recognize\r\nany laws other than those established by each tribe for itself, or\r\naccepted by friendly treaty with the council and disregarded by\r\nindividuals on both sides:--and the United States accepted the offer,\r\nnot for any expected value in the land, but for the unrestricted\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi River. Therefore Missouri was never under\r\nBritish rule and never changed hands by force of arms.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Spanish ladder, it is a tall pine tree notched on\r\nthe sides for steps, and the stump of a branch left or a peg inserted at\r\nconsiderable intervals, for hand supports to assist in raising the\r\nweight of the body.\r\n\r\nReturning to the Auditorium, we entered a passage behind the Great White\r\nThrone and started on what might well be called the Water Route, for no\r\ndry spot is touched on the round trip; but if one goes prepared for\r\nsuch a journey it is well worth the effort and the mud. If the visitor\r\nis a man, the suit worn should be one he is ready to part with, or\r\noveralls; ladies receive the same advice even to the overalls, as some\r\nof the most beautiful portions of the cave, which we failed to see, can\r\nbe visited only in that objectionable costume. To visit any cave\r\ncomfortably a short dress is necessary and if any thing like a thorough\r\nknowledge of the ramifications is desired, the unavoidable climbing will\r\nsoon prove the superior claims of a divided skirt; but if it is properly\r\nmade, only the wearer need be conscious of the divide. Rubber boots and\r\nwater-proof protection for the head and shoulders complete a costume\r\nthat is not exactly an artistic creation, unless our ideas of art have\r\nbeen gathered in the school of Socrates, but it is suited to the\r\nrequirements of the occasion and makes the explorations far more easy\r\nand profitable than they otherwise could be.\r\n\r\nThe passage back of the White Throne is called the Serpentine Passage,\r\nand most of it is sufficiently high for traveling in an erect position;\r\nyet there are several places that require crawling. The first stopping\r\npoint is the Gulf of Doom Room, or as it is also known, the Register\r\nRoom, because here visitors usually write their names in the peculiar\r\ndark red clay, which is moist but firm and cuts with a polish. This\r\nroom is twenty-five feet high and fifty feet wide, and looks off into\r\nthe Gulf of Doom, which seems rightly named when a rock is thrown into\r\nit and you note the lapse of time before any sound returns; and when the\r\nawful Gulf is made visible by lights thrown in, one involuntarily seeks\r\na firmer footing and clings to a projecting rock. The height of the Gulf\r\nis ninety-five feet and the distant sound of falling water is not\r\nreassuring. The walls are not smoothly worn away, but have the rough and\r\nweird appearance of having been torn by a torrent in a narrow mountain\r\ngorge, and are stained with the dark clay.\r\n\r\nRetracing our steps a short distance, if that style of locomotion could\r\nbe called steps, we turned into Doré's Gallery, and surely that artist\r\nwas in his usual working mood when he conceived this awful method of\r\nconnecting the upper regions with the lower. Great bowlders have fallen\r\ndown without helping to fill the black holes that received them, and\r\ninto this real Inferno we proceeded to descend by narrow, ladder-like\r\nstairs provided with a light hand rail, and trembling slightly with the\r\nresponsibility they assumed. If any one's courage trembled too, no\r\nnotice was taken of it, and a record of exploring experiences does not\r\nnecessarily include a confession of any doubts.\r\n\r\nOn all the ladders in this Gallery was a fine white fungus growth in the\r\nform of a thick, heavy mold, that the lightest touch destroyed. In caves\r\nwhere some care is taken to protect this mold, it attains a growth of\r\nsix or more feet and assumes the forms of sea-weed.\r\n\r\nOnce down the first and longest flight of stairs, without any signs of a\r\nDoré dragon raising its huge body by heavy claws to a resting place\r\namong the rocks, awe divides more evenly with admiration; and being\r\nalready well besmeared with mud, we climbed over the clay-covered\r\nbowlders and crawled through narrow holes with perfect satisfaction,\r\nenjoying each novel scene to the utmost.\r\n\r\nOff from the Doré Gallery is a small chamber containing the Fountain of\r\nYouth, that must be seen, but the way, like that of the transgressor, is\r\nhard. Arrived at the entrance we hesitated a moment, for although\r\ngetting in looked possible, the way out again seemed not so simple; but\r\nfinally trusting to Providence, through the direct agency of our careful\r\nguardians, of course, we sat down on the edge of the large slippery\r\nbowlder on which we stood, and reaching out caught a projection of the\r\nwall on one side and a bowlder crag on the other, swung off and dropped\r\ninto the soft mud below. This chamber proved to be a little gem; small\r\nbut high, and beautifully adorned with calcite crystal. Down a wall of\r\nred onyx on one side clear water flows into a basin in the irregular,\r\nrocky floor, just behind the bowlder we had used for a hand-rest at the\r\nentrance; the perfectly transparent water in the basin appears to be\r\nonly a few inches deep, but measures three feet, and is several degrees\r\ncolder than the air, which in this portion of the cave is warm. The\r\nother wall of this room is an almost perpendicular bank of the soft dark\r\nred clay, in which small selenite crystals are sprouting like plants in\r\na garden.\r\n\r\nSuddenly we heard a heavy, rolling noise like distant thunder, and\r\nasking if it were possible to hear a thunder storm so far below the\r\nsurface, were told it was the protest of angry bats against a further\r\nadvance on the quarters to which they have retreated from the main body\r\nof the cave, and their orders were obeyed: so of what may be in that\r\ndirection, we gained no positive knowledge besides bats, and the fact\r\nthat, small as they are, their great numbers make them dangerous when\r\nangry. Returning to the gallery and continuing the journey down over\r\nslippery rock and slender ladders we came at length to the bottom of the\r\nGulf of Doom, into which we had looked from the room now high above us;\r\nand we needed no stimulating help to the imagination to pronounce it a\r\nfit termination to an artist's troubled dream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Waterfall. Page 41.]\r\n\r\nThen climbing over an assortment of bowlders of all sizes, going up a\r\nlittle, and swinging or sliding down, we came to a point in the narrow\r\npassage where the floor is a flat slab, like a large paving stone,\r\ntilted up at a steep angle against one wall and not reaching the other\r\nby about fifteen inches, with darkness of unknown depth below: about\r\nthree feet above this opening the wall projects in a narrow, shelving\r\nledge, and everything is covered with a thin coating of slippery wet\r\nclay. The only way to cross that uninviting bridge is to brace the feet\r\nagainst the slab, and leaning on the ledge, slowly work across. A little\r\nmore rough work and the descent of the two short ladders, brought us, at\r\nlast, under the beautiful Waterfall, where we stood as in a heavy shower\r\nof rain at the lowest point yet reached in the cave, which according to\r\nthe survey of Mr. Prince is four hundred feet below the surface. The\r\nfalling water has ornamented the walls, which in this portion of the\r\ncave expose over two hundred feet of Magnesian Limestone, with unique\r\nforms of dripstone; and the steeply sloping floor has received the\r\nover-charge of calcium carbonate until it has become a shining mass of\r\nonyx, retaining pools of cold, transparent water in the depressions. In\r\nthe lowest corner there is only mud, and above it rises, to a height of\r\nat least fifteen feet a bank of miry, yellow clay, at the top of which a\r\nhole in the wall is the only known entrance to Blondy's Throne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Longitudinal and Cross-Sections of Passages in Marble\r\nCave, Stone Co., Missouri.\r\n\r\nPlotted by Fred Prince, 1894.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMARBLE CAVE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn account of the long \"crawl\" through mud and cold water, it was at\r\nfirst suggested and then strongly advised, that we should not undertake\r\nto make the trip to Blondy's Throne: and yearning to see what is\r\nconsidered the cave's chief beauty was not easy to overcome, but after\r\ncareful attention to the deep mire of the approach the advice seemed\r\ngood, especially as Mr. Powell kindly promised to write a description of\r\nits trials and treasures; which he promptly did, thereby making it\r\npossible for us to continue the journey now without a disappointing\r\ninterruption, so we will proceed to wade that mud bank with him in his\r\nown way. He says: \"As Mecca is to the Mohammedan, so is Blondy's Throne\r\nRoom to the pilgrim who invades the chaos and penetrates the mysteries\r\nof Marble Cave. When the subject is mentioned to the guide, he shrugs\r\nhis shoulders and assumes an imploring look, and begins at once to\r\nmention the difficulties of getting there. But if you insist upon it he\r\nwill go. The passage by which this room has to be reached, if passage it\r\nmay be called, must be entered from the Waterfall Room, and a steep\r\nascent must be made until an elevation of fifty feet is reached above\r\nthe bottom of that room. This ascent has been called Hughse's Slide, as\r\na man of that name once lost his footing at the top and slid on the wet\r\nand very slippery clay all the way to the bottom, leaving a very sleek\r\ntrail. The ascent is difficult, as the soft clay is deep and wet and the\r\nsides are reeking and covered also with soft yielding clay. When the top\r\nof the slide is once reached, a low passage six feet wide and two feet\r\nhigh is discovered, and stooping low, or actually lying flat down, you\r\nenter. The top of the passage is of smooth rock and the bottom is of wet\r\nclay with an occasional variation of sharp gravel. The air is good, and\r\nas a lizard, you start forward. In places the passage widens to ten or\r\ntwelve feet and again narrows to six feet.\r\n\r\n\"In about one hundred feet you encounter a small pond of water filling\r\nthe whole width of the passage and extending twenty to thirty feet, but\r\nthe guide tells you it is only one foot deep, and calls attention to the\r\nfact that the water does not come within a foot of the roof of the\r\npassage and you can easily keep your chin above it, and with this\r\nassurance through you go.\r\n\r\n\"Within the next one hundred feet you encounter and pass in the same\r\nmanner three more ponds of varying sizes. The guide calls your\r\nattention to the fact that you are not alone, and looking about you by\r\nthe dim light of your candle you see numbers of small eyeless\r\nsalamanders, from four inches to one foot long. They are peaceable and\r\nharmless, appear to have no teeth and are easily caught, if you so\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\n\"Another hundred feet and the Rest Room, or Egyptian Temple is reached,\r\nand rising to your feet you may rest. The room is small, but contains\r\nbeautifully fluted walls, resembling basaltic columns; and natural marks\r\nof erosion that resemble hieroglyphic inscriptions. From the other side\r\nof this room the passage goes on with the same characteristics, but as\r\nyou enter to go forward a sound strikes the ear, and you pause to\r\nlisten. It is a confusion of sounds, a babel of voices; and sounds like\r\na distant conversation carried on by a large number of people. So\r\nstriking is this resemblance that you instantly ask the guide if there\r\nare people in the room ahead, and hardly believe him when he says, 'No.'\r\n\r\n\"You hear voices of men, voices of boys, babies, girls and ladies, and\r\noccasionally loud laughter; but forward is the word and on you go,\r\nencouraged by the assurance of the guide that you are now over half way\r\nthrough the passage and that the sounds came from Blondy's Throne Room.\r\nSuddenly the passage divides into two much alike, and taking the right\r\nhand one, you make your slow advance until at last, with clothes soaked\r\nand covered with clay mud, and your strength about gone, you begin to\r\nfeel desperate and tell the guide that you will go no further, when you\r\nsee him rise to his feet, and he says: 'Here we are.' You step over a\r\nsteep bank of clay and emerge into a large room. It is almost square in\r\nshape; about eighty feet long and sixty feet wide, and about fifty feet\r\nhigh, with white, smooth walls and a pure white ceiling, and sloping\r\ngradually downward on the left ends in a small, clear lake of water.\r\nThis lake has a beautiful beach of white pebbles, and though shallow on\r\nthe edge seems quite deep at the center; in fact it is believed to have\r\nthere a concealed opening that gives exit to its waters. On the opposite\r\nside from you, a stream of clear water pours into the lake, and in doing\r\nso it gives off the sounds that in the passage you mistook for human\r\nvoices; and this noble stream has been named Mystic River. It enters the\r\nlake from under a beautiful natural arch, about thirty feet across at\r\nthe bottom, and six feet above the water at the center. The bed of the\r\nstream is eroded from strata of sandstone that is extremely hard,\r\ncontaining corundum, and so perfect is its continuity that it conveys\r\nsound distinctly for a distance far beyond the reach of the human voice,\r\nwhen tapped upon with a hammer. The top of the arch is studded with\r\nlovely stalactites, clear as glass, that extend to the outer edge of the\r\narch and form massive and beautiful groups there. Above the arch is a\r\nlarge opening. In truth the side of the room is out, and a great dark\r\nspace appears like a curtain of black. A natural path leads up over one\r\nside of the arch, and following the lead of the guide you go up above\r\nand learn that a room on the higher level extends off in that direction\r\nand gets larger and higher. The walls are stalagmitic columns in cream\r\ncolor and decked in places with blood-red spots or blotches of Titanic\r\nsize. The ceiling you cannot see. It is too high for the lights you have\r\nto reach. On the left you are suddenly confronted by a stalagmitic\r\nformation so large and so grand that all others are dwarfed into\r\ninsignificance. You think of the dome of the Capitol at Washington. You\r\nare standing at the sloping base but cannot see the top. Just here the\r\nguide announces in an awestruck voice 'Blondy's Throne.' And who is\r\nBlondy? Only a fair-haired, blue-eyed, intrepid and daring\r\nfifteen-year-old boy, named Charles Smallwood, who assisted the writer\r\nin exploring the cave in the early days of 1883, and going on in\r\nadvance, reported back that he had found another and a greater throne\r\nthan the Great White Throne in the Auditorium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blondy's Throne. Page 47.]\r\n\r\n\"Well, here we are at Blondy's Throne at last, and surveying the base,\r\nwe find that it is actually only half in the room we are in; the other\r\nhalf forms the side of another room. In a word, the Great Throne divides\r\nthe room into two parts and makes two rooms of it instead of one. Yet\r\nthe one half of the base has a measurement, by tape line, of one hundred\r\nand fifty feet. The guide now makes preparations to ascend the Throne. A\r\nchain has been fastened up towards the top, and by taking hold of this\r\nthe climb can be made up the sloping sides of the Throne. We pass on and\r\nup over the clearest and most ice-like formation, resembling the great\r\nicebergs seen at sea. Reaching an elevation of sixty feet an opening\r\ninto the dome is found, and stooping, you enter. It is a room about\r\ntwenty feet across, with a white ice-like floor, a roof or ceiling ten\r\nfeet above, and from it hang thousands of brilliant stalactites and from\r\nthe floor stalagmites rise up to meet them. They are in all sizes, from\r\nan inch to two feet across. The sides are of the same material joined\r\nand cemented lightly together. Strike any of them and clear musical\r\nnotes are given off; a musician has found two full octaves. Water is\r\ndripping in many places, and in the center of the floor is a tank full\r\nof clear water. It is four feet wide, twelve feet long and of unknown\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n\"On the opposite side of the room from which you enter there is a hole\r\nor opening in the wall. It is large enough to go through but it goes\r\ninto the great dark room on the other side of the Throne. An abyss\r\nconfronts you, a sheer precipice which descends for many feet, perhaps\r\nhundreds. No man knows. This outer room of Blondy's Throne has been\r\nnamed the Chamber of the Fairies. Leaving it and continuing the ascent,\r\nthe top of the Throne is soon reached and is about twenty feet across;\r\nand from several points still higher, rise stalagmitic spires.\r\n\r\n\"The actual height of Blondy's Throne is not known, but is probably\r\nabout one hundred feet. Again look upwards for the ceiling from the\r\ndizzy height on top of the Throne; you cannot see it. Burn magnesium\r\nribbon and look up, and you see a white ceiling spangled with groups of\r\nstalactites. It is surely one hundred feet away. Then look off into the\r\nunknown room which is called the Great Beyond. No human being has ever\r\nexplored or even entered it, but fire balls thrown in reveal the fact\r\nthat it is of great extent; and part of the bottom water and part land.\r\nNo way of getting into it has ever yet been found, so its mysteries,\r\nlessons and revelations are still safe from human intrusion. How far it\r\ngoes, where it stops, and what it leads to, are facts for some future\r\nexplorer to discover. Bats and white salamanders are found in Blondy's\r\nThrone Room, and some larger animals have been heard to jump into the\r\nwater and escape on the approach of man, but their species is not known.\r\n\r\n\"The arched passage of Mystic River has been followed up for a journey\r\nof an hour, but further than that its extent is unknown. It was hoped\r\nthat a way would be thus found into the Great Beyond, but it did not\r\nprove successful. A well equipped party could find there a chance for\r\nsome grand discoveries, and it would be one of the notable pleasures of\r\nthe life of the writer to be one of such a party.\r\n\r\n\"The exit from Blondy's Throne Room is always made with deep regret that\r\nthe waning lights and meager supplies will not allow a longer stay. The\r\nlong crawl, the mud and the water are all forgotten, and notwithstanding\r\nthe terror of the trip one feels well repaid.\"\r\n\r\nWe thank Mr. Powell for a charming journey without its discomfort and\r\ndanger, and resume our travels at the Waterfall.\r\n\r\nFrom the foot of the Waterfall we returned again to the Auditorium, in\r\ntime to enjoy a sight such as we supposed could exist only in a\r\nbrilliant imagination; and the return at that hour was not a lucky\r\naccident of fate, but the result of careful attention to a prearranged\r\ndesign that we should not fail to witness a marvelous display never\r\nsurpassed by lavish Nature. The day outside was one of cloudless\r\nsummer sunshine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blondy's Throne Room. Page 50.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Foot of Waterfall. Page 50.]\r\n\r\nOur eyes having grown accustomed to the dim light of candles in passages\r\nwhere absolute darkness, unrelieved by the stars of midnight, always\r\nreigns, the great Auditorium appeared before us softly flooded with\r\ndaylight diffused from a broad white beam slanting down in long straight\r\nlines from the entrance as from a rift in heavy clouds; only this rift\r\ndisplayed around its edges a brilliant border of vegetation that the\r\nrough rocks cherish with tender care.\r\n\r\nAs we stood lost in almost speechless admiration, and without the\r\nslightest warning of treasure yet in store, the white beam was stabbed\r\nby a narrow, gleaming shaft of yellow sunlight. The glorious, radiant\r\nbeauty of the picture presented is utterly indescribable, but it was of\r\nshort duration, and in a few seconds the golden blade was withdrawn as\r\nsuddenly as it had appeared.\r\n\r\nIf the genius of Elkins had been granted the privilege we enjoyed, the\r\nartist-world of Europe that graciously yielded the highest honor to his\r\n\"Sunbeam on Mount Shasta,\" would have knelt in rapturous humility.\r\nSpeaking of his great work, as we stood before it only a few months\r\nbefore his death, Mr. Elkins said quietly: \"It is no great achievement;\r\nI simply painted it exactly as it looked. Anyone could do the same.\"\r\nBut no one ever has.\r\n\r\nThe white beam was more enduring and by its aid we were able to view the\r\nexpanse of the great Auditorium far better than could have been done in\r\nthe momentary glare of any brilliant artificial light. Every part of the\r\ncloud-gray walls shows a stratification as regularly horizontal as if\r\nthe laying of each course had been done with the assistance of line and\r\nlevel; while in every direction are now seen hundreds of stalactites\r\nthat had not been noticed before, and although they look small, the\r\naverage length, taken with the surveying instruments, is fourteen feet.\r\nThe Hill beneath the entrance is an accumulation of debris, drifted in\r\nfrom the outside, and rising to a height of more than one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five feet; while the great circumference of its supporting base,\r\nrevealed by the banishment of shadows, suggests the possibility of\r\ntragic history of which the only evidence lies buried there and may or\r\nmay not ever be discovered; but let us step lightly, since our feet may\r\npress the covering that shields a final sleep; and also let a grieving\r\nsister in her old age take comfort in the knowledge that here, as in few\r\nother spots, nature provides a certain and gentle burial for the\r\nunfortunate, and for a few seconds each day lights the dim chamber with\r\na heavenly glory--perhaps in appeal to the sons of one country to\r\nharbor no such feelings as deprived Abel of life and for all time and\r\neternity tarnished the honor of Cain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entrance to Cave--Interior View. Page 52.]\r\n\r\nThe chilliness presently recalled us from further indulgence in that\r\ngreat scene, to ordinary affairs; and consulting the reliable\r\nthermometer, it was found to register 42°, while in some of the lower\r\npassages the temperature is 58°; but the variation is not in accordance\r\nwith the accepted theory of one degree to the one hundred feet descent.\r\n\r\nA return to the beautiful Spring of Youth Room was now a necessity, but\r\nwe were careful to allow no drop of water falling from clay-stained\r\nhands to reach the purity of that lovely bowl, and then being happy and\r\nhungry, we retired to the piano's protecting tent for refreshment.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere in Marble Cave has the peculiar bracing and invigorating\r\nquality common to the majority of caves, that seems almost to defy\r\nfatigue and encourage exertion that under ordinary conditions would be\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAfter the exertion necessary in the warmer portions of the cave, the\r\ntemperature of 42° proved rather low for comfort and finally was\r\nadmitted to be a sufficient reason for either leaving the cave or\r\nsending out for the wraps. Slowly and reluctantly the party walked up\r\nthe long winding path to the summit of the Hill where the stairway\r\nfinds support, stopping many times to admire again the perfect curves\r\nand fine color-tones of that wonderful high arch--within a mountain yet\r\nsoftly radiant with the light of day.\r\n\r\nStill lingering regretfully among the fern-decked rocks before quite\r\nfinishing the ascent to the actual outside world, the mercury lost\r\nlittle time in registering eighty degrees.\r\n\r\nSince no official, or even approximately correct map of Marble Cave has\r\nyet been published, and the desirability of maps is particularly urged\r\nby Monsieur E.A. Martel, a special effort was made to secure one, which\r\nwas accompanied by the following remarks from Mr. Prince in regard to\r\nits incompleteness:\r\n\r\n\"There are several passages and rooms which do not appear on the map,\r\nthough some of them are well known, but have not been surveyed and\r\nplatted.\r\n\r\n\"Much further exploration is possible in this great cavern. Lost River\r\nCañon ends abruptly in a bank of red clay, the volume of water being\r\nundiminished. The water from the Great Fall flows by a small serpentine\r\ninto a passage which has never been followed up; its entrance being\r\nseveral hundred feet higher than the nearest water level.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the quantity of water in the cave at the time of the\r\nvisit just described was so unusually great as to render the Lost River\r\nCañon trip impossible.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous season the cave and its surroundings were visited by\r\na prominent naturalist who appears to have been delightfully liberal in\r\nthe diffusion of scientific knowledge and the explanations of methods of\r\npursuing investigations. His practical instruction in snake catching is\r\nparticularly interesting as it was never before introduced into this\r\nstate, where the copperhead and rattler are known to have survived among\r\nthe fittest. Seeing a snake hole and desiring information as to the\r\nfamily record of the proprietor, he inserted a finger, and while waiting\r\nfor results explained that there is no better way to secure a specimen,\r\nas the enraged reptile will fasten its fangs into the intruding member\r\nand then can be easily withdrawn. It is a pleasure to state that even\r\nsnakes recognize the claims of friendship, and no injury was\r\nexperienced.[2]\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Marble Cave there are several choice varieties of\r\nonyx and marble, among them a rare and beautiful onyx in black and\r\nyellow. The coloring, tinting and banding of onyx seem generally to be\r\nregarded as one of the unexplainable mysteries of nature, but is in\r\nreality an extremely simple process that can be easily studied in any\r\nactive cave.\r\n\r\nWhen the percolating acidulated water passes slowly through a pure\r\nlimestone it is filtered of impurities and deposits a crystal, either\r\npure white or transparent; if it comes in contact with metallic bodies\r\nof any kind, it carries away more or less in solution to act as coloring\r\nmatter; the beautiful pale green onyx in several Missouri counties\r\ntaking its tint from the copper; in South Dakota, manganese in various\r\ncombinations produces black and many shades of brown; in both states an\r\nexcessive flow of water often carries a quantity of red or yellow clay\r\nwhich temporarily destroys the beauty of exposed surfaces, but in after\r\nyears becomes a fine band of brilliant color.\r\n\r\nSmall wind caves are numerous in the Ozarks and being cold are\r\nfrequently utilized for the preservation of domestic supplies. The\r\nentrance to one in the neighborhood of Marble Cave is high up on the\r\nhill-side south of Mr. Powell's house and being visible from the porch\r\nwas too tempting to be ignored, and the walk up to it for a better view\r\nwas rewarded with a most charming bit of scenery as well. All the quiet\r\nvalley, divided by a rushing little stream, lay before us in the shadow\r\nof early evening, while to the north and east the hills were brilliant\r\nin summer sunshine, with one small open glade gleaming vividly among\r\nthe darker shades of forest green.\r\n\r\nThe cave was a very small room at the bottom of a steep, rocky, sloping\r\npassage, and contained no standing water, although there had been a\r\nheavy rainfall the night before and the opening is so situated as to\r\nespecially favor the inflow, which naturally indicates a greater cave\r\nbeneath a hidden passage. Here, as in most of the caves of the region,\r\nis found a small lizard: it is totally blind but its ancestors evidently\r\nwere not, as is shown by conspicuous protuberances where the eyes should\r\nbe, but over which the skin is drawn without a wrinkle or seam to\r\nindicate a former opening. These harmless creatures are not scaly, but\r\nare clothed in a soft, shining, well-fitted skin, and the largest seen\r\nwere little more than six inches long.\r\n\r\nThose who love perfect Nature in a most smiling mood should hasten to\r\nvisit Marble Cave while yet no railroad quite touches the county.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] The naturalist referred to is the late Prof. E.D. Cope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFAIRY CAVE AND POWELL CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFairy Cave enjoys the reputation of being the most beautiful yet\r\ndiscovered in that cavernous region, and consequently a visit to it was\r\ncontemplated with considerable eagerness, although the mode of entrance\r\nhad been described with sufficient accuracy to prevent any misconception\r\nof the difficulties to be overcome or the personal risk involved. To go\r\nfrom our temporary abiding place it was necessary to pass Marble Cave,\r\nand when we had gone that far Mr. Powell left us to follow the road,\r\nwhile he, on his mule, took a short cut across the hills and valleys, to\r\ntry to find men not too much occupied with their own affairs on a fine\r\nMonday morning, in corn plowing time, to join our expedition. As neither\r\nour small companion, Merle, nor ourselves, had any knowledge of the\r\nlocality of our destination, we were carefully instructed to follow the\r\nmain road to the Wilderness Ridge, and keeping to that, pass the Indian\r\nCreek road and all others that are plain, but turn down the second dim\r\nroad and follow it until stopped by a new fence where we would be met\r\nand conducted. So long as points to be passed held out, these directions\r\ngave us no trouble whatever, even the first dim road offering no\r\nobstacle to the pleasure of our progress; but the second dim road proved\r\nso elusive we traveled many miles in search of it, finally bringing up\r\nagainst a place Merle was familiar with and knew to be a long way off\r\nthe track of our intentions. As there was nothing to be done but return\r\nwe naturally accepted the situation and did that; presently finding Mr.\r\nPowell and the Messrs. Irwin, on whose land the cave is, patiently\r\nwaiting for us in what was really not a road at all, but rather, in this\r\nregion of fossils, the badly preserved impression of one long since\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nThe new fence was opened at two places that we might drive through and\r\nbe saved the exertion of walking a considerable distance, then the\r\nhorses were left in the shade while we scrambled down the steep\r\nhill-side covered with sharp-edged, broken rock, about mid-way down\r\nwhich is the mouth of the cave, yawning like a narrow, open well. Above\r\nthis a stout windlass has been arranged on two forked logs.\r\n\r\nA few feet below the surface the cave spreads out jug-shaped, so that in\r\ndescending nothing is touched until the floor is reached, one hundred\r\nfeet beneath the surface; consequently the only danger to be apprehended\r\nis a fall.\r\n\r\nEach of the three men present kindly offered to go down and make the\r\nexploration with me, but that would have left only two at the windlass,\r\nand for a man's weight, safety requires four. Should an accident occur,\r\nassistance would be necessary, and some time lost in finding it; so, to\r\nthe undisguised satisfaction of one and equally evident relief of the\r\nothers, it was reluctantly decided that the trip must be given up, and\r\ntherefore we are indebted to the kindness of Captain Powell[3] for the\r\nfollowing description of Fairy Cave:\r\n\r\n     \"The Cave referred to is situated in Section 24, Township 23, Range\r\n     23, in Stone County, Missouri, and is on the homestead of one of\r\n     three brothers named Irwin.\r\n\r\n     \"It was accidentally discovered in the year 1895 and up to the time\r\n     of this writing (June 1896) only six persons have ever entered it.\r\n     It is in a point or spur of the Ozark Mountains which runs to the\r\n     east from the great Wilderness Ridge, and is three miles distant\r\n     from the Marble Cave. Having been one of the first to enter the\r\n     Cave, being called by the owner as a sort of cave expert, I will\r\n     attempt to describe both the adventure and the cave just as they\r\n     were. The measurements are simply estimated, though by long\r\n     practice I have become expert in that line also, but the longest\r\n     measurement here was correctly taken by the rope used.\r\n\r\n     \"Having been invited by the Irwin brothers to come and examine and\r\n     explore a new cave they had found but had only entered and not\r\n     explored, accompanied by my eldest son, W.T. Powell, I reached the\r\n     place one warm Saturday morning. We found about twelve or fourteen\r\n     men waiting for our coming; some discussing the matter of whether\r\n     we would enter when we did come, and others who had volunteered to\r\n     work the windlass, which had been erected over the opening, by\r\n     means of which, with a one hundred foot rope, entrance was to be\r\n     made. The opening was like a small well, and situated under the\r\n     edge of an overhanging cliff of marble, and on the southeast slope\r\n     of the mountain, about one hundred and fifty feet above the bottom\r\n     of a narrow valley, and about the same distance below the top of\r\n     the mountain, which here is three hundred feet high. In order to\r\n     rig a windlass the edge of the cliff had to be broken away. The\r\n     well-like opening descended for about ten feet through strata of\r\n     flat-laying rocks that formed a roof; then all appeared to be\r\n     vacancy and a stone cast in gave back a distant sound.\r\n\r\n     \"Having first tested the air and proved it good by dropping in\r\n     blazing excelsior saturated with turpentine, a stout oak stick was\r\n     attached to the end of the rope, my son sprang astride and was\r\n     lowered to the bottom, just one hundred feet. He reported back 'All\r\n     right.' On the return of the rope I took my position on the stick\r\n     and was soon dangling in mid air. The sensation was strange and\r\n     exhilarating. Looking up I could only see the small opening I came\r\n     through, and a straggling stream of light poured down that, but on\r\n     all sides profound darkness reigned supreme. A spark-like light my\r\n     son lit, reminded me of the lost Pleiad. About twenty-five or\r\n     thirty feet from the top I caught sight of a scene that made me\r\n     call on the men at the windlass to stop.\r\n\r\n     \"This caused them to think something was going wrong and one called\r\n     out to know what was the matter: I heard him say 'He is weakening.'\r\n     I assured them everything was right only I wanted to take a view;\r\n     so they stopped. Off at a distance of perhaps twenty-five feet was\r\n     an opening about ten feet or more wide and twelve feet high. The\r\n     light from the opening struck it fairly, owing to the position of\r\n     the sun at the time. Through this opening I saw into another room,\r\n     large and magnificent. It brought to mind the White City. It was\r\n     snowy white, and thickly studded with stalactites and stalagmites\r\n     of immense size and in great numbers; some looking like spires of\r\n     numerous churches, and many connected as with a lattice-work about\r\n     the bottom. For a short time I gazed on that lovely scene, and\r\n     examined the chances to reach it, but a great gulf intervened that\r\n     we had no means of spanning, and I called to the men to lower me\r\n     down. Approaching the bottom one of the walls trended in towards me\r\n     and I stepped upon solid ground close to the wall, which half way\r\n     up seemed fifty feet away. The opening above now looked like a\r\n     small pale moon, and the next man who came dangling down to join us\r\n     looked no bigger than a toy soldier. Gradually our eyes became\r\n     accustomed to the twilight, and by the time our party was increased\r\n     to six men, I could see quite distinctly.\r\n\r\n     \"The room runs directly into the mountain and is about ninety feet\r\n     high, and where we landed it proved to be twenty feet wide. It\r\n     extended in both directions, but much the farthest towards the\r\n     right hand. The outer room is encrusted in fine white water\r\n     formations. It forms a Gothic ceiling from which hang pendant at\r\n     all places brilliant and sparkling stalactites; some being of\r\n     immense size and length, from ten to twenty-five feet. Others are\r\n     not so large but are brilliant. We created a flood of artificial\r\n     light with dozens of candles and lamps; and then and not until\r\n     then, could we see the slope and contour of the roof. A few bats\r\n     were flitting about, disturbed for the first time. To the left, a\r\n     vast white pillar extended from floor to roof. It was pure white\r\n     and about five feet in diameter all the way up. It was fluted,\r\n     fretted, draped and spangled. I never in my life saw anything more\r\n     chaste and lovely. I thought of the countless ages it must have\r\n     taken to form that monument: of the streams of clear water that had\r\n     fallen and left their calcite deposits, while it grew year after\r\n     year, age after age, century after century, in this profound\r\n     darkness, disturbed by no noises save the rhythmic sound of the\r\n     falling drops and the dull flitting of the bats, who alone were the\r\n     living witnesses of its construction. To the rear of this great\r\n     pillar the room is divided into three galleries, one above another.\r\n     With great difficulty and much danger we climbed into each of\r\n     these. The floors were all like the pillar of pure white onyx, and\r\n     extended back a distance of thirty or more feet. The floor of one\r\n     formed the roof of another. They were brilliant with hanging\r\n     pendants and the side walls were all veneered with the same white\r\n     and crystalline formation. To entirely describe them is impossible.\r\n     A day in each would still leave the observer short of words in\r\n     which to tell of the wonders.\r\n\r\n     \"Turning towards the right hand from the entrance we advance two\r\n     hundred feet up an incline of dry clay, the room widening gradually\r\n     until its width is forty feet, when we reach the top of an\r\n     elevation thirty feet above the starting point, where a sudden\r\n     steep descent brings us to a halt. A stone cast down strikes water\r\n     and the sound of a splash comes back to us. With caution we seek\r\n     our way down the hill and stand on the edge of a small lake or\r\n     pond. Suddenly my son, who is in the lead, rushes back saying:\r\n     'Look out! I put my hand on a snake.' Some of us, being armed with\r\n     hickory canes that had been thrown down, concentrated our lights\r\n     and advanced. Sure enough, there is a snake a yard long coiled up\r\n     on a section of rotten wood. It proves to be a copperhead, the most\r\n     quarrelsome and vicious snake in this country; but his nature is\r\n     changed so that he makes no effort to fight and is killed with a\r\n     blow, and is sent to be hoisted up that we may examine him in\r\n     daylight. No others were found, and probably he had fallen in at\r\n     the opening, and spent a long, weary time in expiation of his\r\n     upper-earth crimes.\r\n\r\n     \"Examining the lake we find it to be about forty feet wide and the\r\n     same long, and it fills the room from wall to wall. We cannot pass\r\n     it so must either stop or wade through. We decide to wade, and on\r\n     measuring the water find it only two or three feet deep, with a\r\n     soft clay bottom, and in many places islands of stalagmite rise\r\n     above the surface.\r\n\r\n     \"On the sides of the lake there are formations in the shape of\r\n     sofas and lounges, and they appear to be cushioned, but the\r\n     cushions are found to be hard, solid rock. As the lights advance\r\n     across the lake new wonders are revealed. Curtains and draperies\r\n     hanging from the top almost touch the water and entirely cut off\r\n     the view beyond. Passing under a curtain at one of the highest\r\n     places, we emerge from the lake, and once more on dry land, advance\r\n     up a slope. Here the water formations have taken human shapes of\r\n     all sizes and several colors now appear and help to present a chaos\r\n     of beauty.\r\n\r\n     \"Two hundred feet more and the chamber ends in a vast waterfall,\r\n     but the water has turned to stone. Above the waterfall is an\r\n     opening, but it is twenty-five feet up a smooth wall and we have no\r\n     ladder. The journey was at an end. Tired, wet and muddy, we started\r\n     on our return trip; recrossed the dark lake, and retraced our steps\r\n     to the place under the opening without realizing that we had spent\r\n     six hours under ground. While the other members of the party, and\r\n     the specimens, were being raised to the surface, the writer sought\r\n     to learn the flora and fauna of this new region. The flora is\r\n     blank. Even the white mold so common in many caves is absent; and\r\n     no fungus grows on the poles, bark and rotten wood that have at\r\n     some past time been cast in.\r\n\r\n     \"In animal life the range is greater. I have mentioned the\r\n     ever-present bats, and dozens of them were seen. There were also\r\n     small, white eyeless salamanders, small, yellow, speckled\r\n     salamanders, with signs of eyes but no sight; also a jet black\r\n     salamander, which like the rest, was blind. The bats were of two\r\n     species--the common brown bat and the larger light grey or yellow\r\n     species. But this was not the time of the year to see many bats in\r\n     caves. In the summer season most of them go out and remain until\r\n     cool weather, and then return to the caves with their young; so I\r\n     was rather surprised to see as many as we did.\r\n\r\n     \"Down comes the rope for the last time, and taking my place, I soon\r\n     feel myself spinning around and slowly rising. As I again pass the\r\n     magic city I saw going down, a stronger wish than ever takes\r\n     possession of me to go there, and I look for any chance to solve\r\n     the problem of how such a journey can be made. 'Thou art so near\r\n     and yet so far.'\r\n\r\n     \"Suddenly I find myself emerging from the ground into a very hot\r\n     world, with the evening sun blazing so that the air feels like the\r\n     scorching heat of an oven; and my late companions are scattered\r\n     about under the trees, no doubt wishing themselves back in the cool\r\n     regions below the hot cliffs.\r\n\r\n     \"My final conclusions in regard to Fairy Cave were that it was\r\n     about six hundred feet long by from fifteen to forty feet wide and\r\n     from eighty to ninety feet high: that in the upper story there are\r\n     rooms that I could not reach, that will amply pay the scientist\r\n     and explorer to investigate in the future: that probably we reached\r\n     all the accessible parts in the level we traveled: that the\r\n     temperature was fifty-six or very near that degree: that small as\r\n     it is, it contains the finest formations and grandest scenery I\r\n     have ever seen in a cave: and I have examined over one hundred of\r\n     various sizes. I believe that for interior beauty its equal is not\r\n     to be found in America, and I sincerely believe that the verdict of\r\n     future exploration will establish the truth of the assertion, but\r\n     as equally good judges differ on such matters, time will be\r\n     required for a true and just decision. There are yet many promising\r\n     caves to be explored in this region, and if my strength holds out a\r\n     few years I hope to see them all.\r\n\r\n                                                   \"T. S. Powell.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPOWELL CAVE.\r\n\r\nAs a measure of consolation for the disappointment of not seeing the\r\nbeauty of Fairy Cave, Mr. Irwin suggested that only a quarter of a mile\r\nfurther on was another, recently discovered and worthy of a visit,\r\nalthough small.\r\n\r\nIn that region of steep hills and sharp-edged rocks, a great amount of\r\ntravel can be added to the experience of a tender-foot in a short\r\ndistance. The quarter of a mile seemed to stretch out in some mysterious\r\nway as we worked on it, but the variety and abundance of attractions are\r\nmore than ample compensation.\r\n\r\nThe view was fine, including as it did the deep ravine and grassy,\r\nwooded slopes rising three hundred feet above, with here and there a\r\nhandsome ledge of marble exposed like the nearly buried ruin of a\r\nforgotten temple of some past age. Scattered about in great profusion\r\namong the broken rock on the surface of these hill-sides we observed a\r\nwater deposit of iron ore. It is a brown hematite and in some cases\r\nshows the structure of the bits of wood it has replaced. Since this\r\nregion has from the earliest time produced a generous growth of\r\nvegetation, the decay of which has yielded a never-failing supply of\r\nacids to assist in carving the caves and then in their decoration, the\r\npresence of the ore is not difficult to account for. The whole Ozark\r\nuplift being rich in iron, the acidulated drainage waters coming into\r\ncontact dissolved and took it in solution, to re-deposit where and when\r\nconditions should be favorable. These conditions were found in the basin\r\namong the hills and along its outlet.\r\n\r\nIn the Popular Science Monthly of January 1897, a short article by J.T.\r\nDonald, entitled \"A Curious Canadian Iron Mine,\" describes the same\r\nthing going on at the present time in Lac a la Tortue, a small body of\r\nwater in the center of a tract of swamp land, which produces the\r\nvegetation necessary to supply the acid required for a base of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nOf the manner of deposition he says: \"The solution of iron in vegetable\r\nacid (in which the iron is in what the chemist calls the form of a\r\nprotosalt) is oxidized by the action of the air on the surface of the\r\nlake into a persalt, which is insoluble, and appears on the surface in\r\npatches that display the peculiar iridescence characteristic of\r\npetroleum floating on water. Indeed, not infrequently these films of\r\nperoxide of iron are incorrectly attributed to petroleum. These films\r\nbecome heavy by addition of new particles; they sink through the water,\r\nand in this manner, in time, a large amount of iron ore is deposited on\r\nthe lake bottom. It must not be supposed that the ore is deposited as a\r\nfine mud or sediment. On the contrary, in this lake ore, as it is\r\ncalled, we have an excellent illustration of what is called\r\nconcretionary action--that is, the tendency of matter when in a fine\r\nstate of division to aggregate its particles into masses about some\r\ncentral nucleus, which may be a fragment of sunken wood, a grain of\r\nsand, or indeed a pre-formed small mass of itself.\"\r\n\r\nIt is claimed for this water ore, which is gathered like oysters, that\r\nmixed with bog ore and magnetic iron, and smelted with charcoal, the\r\nresult as obtained is strong, durable and high priced.\r\n\r\nThe curiously elastic quarter of a mile finally yielded to persistent\r\ntoil, and the cave was reached. The entrance is sufficiently broad to\r\ngive a good first impression, and is under a heavy ledge of limestone\r\nwhich breaks the slope of the hill and is artistically decorated with a\r\nchoice collection of foliage, among which is a coral honeysuckle; the\r\nfragrant variety grows everywhere. Under the ledge is a narrow\r\nvestibule, out of the north end of which is a passage about twenty-four\r\ninches in width, between perpendicular walls, and as steeply inclined as\r\nthe average dwelling-house stairway but without any assisting\r\ndepressions to serve as steps. Mr. Irwin cut a grape vine, and making\r\none end secure at the entrance, provided a hand rail, by the aid of\r\nwhich I was able to easily descend the stepless way and afterwards\r\nremount.\r\n\r\nThe first chamber entered is the principal portion of the cave, and by\r\nactual measurement is forty-nine feet in length by forty-eight in\r\ngreatest width and the height estimated at fifty feet. On account of\r\nirregularities it appears smaller but higher. On opposite sides of the\r\nchamber, at elevation about midway between the floor and ceiling are two\r\nopen galleries. The floor is extremely irregular with its accumulation\r\nof fallen masses of rock, and the action of water has given to portions\r\nof the walls the appearance of pillars supporting the arches of the\r\nroof. The whole aspect is that of a small Gothic chapel. Off to the\r\nnorthwest is another room measuring thirty feet in each direction, and\r\nout of this are several openings, too small to squeeze through, which\r\nindicate the possible existence of other chambers beyond, but they may\r\nbe only drain pipes.\r\n\r\nThe cave contains no drip formations, notwithstanding which it is one of\r\nthe most charming, and when invited to name it I called it Powell Cave,\r\nin honor of the most ardent admirer of caves in that county, and to whom\r\nI am much indebted for valued assistance.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Editor of the county news-paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOTHER STONE COUNTY CAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENTRY CAVE.\r\n\r\nThe cave nearest to Galena, and the first visited by us, is Gentry Cave,\r\nsituated a mile and a half from town. We started in the mail coach, but\r\nthat vehicle met with a misfortune by no means unusual in that region,\r\nthe total wreck of a wheel. Having only that morning arrived from the\r\nrich agricultural portion of the State where no surface rock can be\r\nfound, we were pleased enough with the prospect of a walk in such\r\ncharming spring weather, and set out with a cheerful certainty that the\r\nrough place in the road would soon be passed. But the school of\r\nexperience is always open for the reception of new-comers and we were\r\nadmitted to full duty without question.\r\n\r\nThe topography was nearly as broken, in its way, as the natural \"piking\"\r\nspread over it, and very beautiful with the dense forests lighted by the\r\nslanting yellow rays of the afternoon sun. The way leads up to the\r\n\"ridge road\" which is at length abandoned for no road at all, and\r\ndescending through the forest, more than half the distance down to the\r\nJames River flowing at the base of the hill, we come suddenly in view of\r\nthe cave entrance, which is probably one of the most magnificent pieces\r\nof natural architecture ever seen.\r\n\r\nRounding a corner by a narrow path, we step onto a covered portico\r\nninety-seven feet long, with an average width of ten feet. The floor is\r\nsmooth and level, as also is the ceiling, which is nine feet above,\r\nsupported by handsomely carved pillars and rising in a gray cliff\r\nprojecting from the slope of the hill above, out to the brink of the\r\nmore abrupt descent to the water's edge ninety feet below. Between the\r\npillars are three large door-ways into the cave. The comparison\r\nsuggested is an Egyptian temple, and the idea is continued within, where\r\nthere are no chambers as in other caves; but instead, the entire\r\ninterior is a labyrinth of passages winding about in every direction\r\namong an uncounted number of low massive pillars, some supporting a low\r\nceiling and others connected by high arches, the highest point being\r\nestimated at sixty feet, but appearing to be more, because the enclosed\r\nspace rising to a dome is so narrow that the point of view is\r\nnecessarily directly underneath.\r\n\r\nAll exposed surfaces of pillars and walls inside the cave are of clay or\r\na soft porous rock having the same appearance, and are covered with\r\ncurious little raised markings like the indescribable designs of mixed\r\nnothing generally known as \"Persian patterns.\" This is, of course,\r\neasily explained; the clay being the residuum from disintegrated\r\nlimestone, the markings described are the harder portions of the rock\r\nremaining after particles of clay had been carried out by flowing water\r\nwhile the disintegrating process was yet incomplete.\r\n\r\nThe Drinking Fountain is considered the great attraction of the cave,\r\nand appears to have been fashioned to suggest a model for the handsome\r\nsoda fountains belonging to a later period. The water bowl is a large\r\ndepression worn in the top of a rock which seems to have been built into\r\nthe wall. In front it is five feet high and nine feet across, with\r\nartistic corners approximately alike, and at the back ornamental carving\r\nextends upward towards the ceiling with an opening through the wall at\r\nthe center. This opening is divided by a short column down which water\r\ntrickles to supply the bowl. The ceiling here is about thirty-five feet\r\nhigh and most of the exposed surface is a blue-gray limestone. Only one\r\nportion of Gentry Cave has received a deposit of dripstone and even that\r\nis of limited extent, and located at the end of a narrow slippery\r\npassage between high, slippery walls.\r\n\r\nThe fine entrance is of grey limestone in undisturbed horizontal strata,\r\nand this is so plainly marked in the roof-supporting pillars as to give\r\nthem the appearance of having been prepared by skillful hands, in\r\nseveral blocks, and afterwards arranged in place without the aid of\r\nmortar. Unfortunately, all efforts to photograph this wonderful portico\r\nhave failed to give satisfaction--its position above the river being\r\nsuch as to afford no point for the proper placing of the camera; but a\r\nsecond visit made for the purpose of trying was far from being a loss,\r\nand part of the reward consisted of finding among the sheltered rocks,\r\nscarcely three feet above the floor, two humming birds' nests with their\r\ntreasure of small eggs, and our little companion who discovered them was\r\npleased to leave them untouched.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR TREE HOLLOW CAVE.\r\n\r\nThe name of this cave is due to the fact that the approach is through a\r\n\"hollow\" well wooded with sugar maple trees. It is two miles from Galena\r\nand the drive a beautiful one, as much of the way is through the forest\r\nwithout a road, but with a charming little rushing, crooked stream of\r\nclear, cold water: and in places the green slopes give way to mural\r\nbluffs of grey limestone in undisturbed strata.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the cave is through a hole about two feet high by three\r\nin width, into which we went feet first and wiggled slowly down an\r\nincline covered with broken rock, for a distance of fifteen feet, where\r\na standing depth is reached. A flat, straight, level ceiling extends\r\nover the whole cave without any perceptible variation, and this is\r\nbordered around its entire length and breadth with a heavy cornice of\r\ndripstone, made very ornamental by the forms it assumes, and the\r\nmultitude of depending stalactites that fall as a fringe around the\r\nwalls. The line of contact between the cornice and ceiling is as clear\r\nand strong as if both had been finished separately before the cornice\r\nwas put in place by skillful hands.\r\n\r\nDripstone covers the walls, which vary in height from one foot to twenty\r\nfeet, according to the irregularities of the floor, just as the width of\r\nthis one-room cave varies with the curves of the walls, which are\r\nsweeping and graceful, the average being twenty-nine feet, but is much\r\ngreater at the entrance where the entire slope extends out beyond the\r\nbody of the cave. The length, from north to south, measures two hundred\r\nand thirty-three feet exclusive of an inaccessible extension.\r\n\r\nThe south end of the cave rises by a steep slope to within a foot of the\r\nceiling with which it is connected by short but heavy columns of\r\ndripstone, and another line of pillars of graduated height meets this\r\nat right angles near the middle and ends in an immense stalagmite that\r\nstands at the foot of the slope like a grand newel post.\r\n\r\nThere is no standing water in the cave, but everything is wet with drip,\r\nand consequently the formation of onyx is actively progressing and the\r\nsouth slope already mentioned shows a curious succession of changes in\r\ncave affairs. By the slow action of acidulated waters, the grey\r\nlimestone deteriorated into a yellowish clay-bank, and now its particles\r\nare being re-united into solid rock by the deposit of calcium carbonate\r\nfrom the drip.\r\n\r\nA careful test of the temperature of the atmosphere showed it to be\r\nfifty-eight degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nPINE RUN CAVE.\r\n\r\nThis also is a small cave easily visited from Galena, being less than\r\ntwo miles distant on the Marionville road. The entrance faces the road\r\nand is on the same level, consequently it is one of the easiest to\r\nvisit. Just within is seen an opening in the ceiling, which we are told\r\nis one of the two ways to an upper chamber whose chief attraction is a\r\ndripstone piano, and the means of ascending is at hand in the form of a\r\nSpanish ladder; but an attempt of that sort might even cause the new\r\nwoman to hesitate, and who hesitates is lost. The ascent was not made.\r\nWe advanced on a level with the road for a distance of perhaps twenty\r\nfeet, when the direction of the cave changed with a right angular turn\r\nand we were in a straight gallery about two hundred and fifty feet long\r\nand fifteen feet in width, the height gradually decreasing to about\r\nthree feet towards the upper end, where it widened out into a low but\r\nbroad chamber. The floor of this chamber is most beautiful. It is\r\ncomposed of a series of connected calcite bowls whose beautifully fluted\r\nrims are of regular and uniform height, and all are equally filled with\r\nclear, still water. A great number of these basins are said to have been\r\ndestroyed by an ax in the hands of a poor witless creature for the\r\ngratification of a burst of temper, and a magnificent stalagmitic\r\ncolumn, too heavy for one man to lift, lay detached and broken, in proof\r\nthat his body did not share the feebleness of his mind.\r\n\r\nBeyond these basins is a low passage through which is found the second\r\nentrance to the upper chamber, but the basins must be crossed in order\r\nto reach it, and this is not an easy undertaking even when their water\r\nsupply is low, but in the early summer they are almost full.\r\n\r\nThere are said to be more than one hundred caves in Stone County, one of\r\nwhich is supposed to be fully as large as Marble Cave, if not larger,\r\nand is located in the southern part of the county but has not been\r\nexplored.\r\n\r\nMill Cave is in the northeast of the county, and at the entrance is a\r\nsaw mill which receives its working power from the cave stream. Inside\r\nthe cave there is a lake.\r\n\r\nHermit's Cave is a few miles from Galena, and is so named on account of\r\nhaving been used as a dwelling by its former owner, who kept a coffin in\r\nwhich he intended to place himself before the final summons, but was\r\novertaken by death in the forest and it was never used. He wrote sermons\r\non the rocks in his cave and one of these was afterwards removed.\r\n\r\nWolf's Den is also near Galena, and has been utilized as a sheep fold.\r\n\r\nWild Man's Cave is near Galena, and on account of the stories with which\r\npeople have been frightened, can only be visited by permission and with\r\na guard stationed at the entrance.\r\n\r\nReynard's Cave is four miles west of Galena on the farm of Dr. Fox, but\r\nis so nearly filled up with dripstone that only crawling room remains.\r\nThe doctor's place is a fine locality for the collection of fossils.\r\n\r\nAt a distance of twelve miles from Galena there is said to be a fine\r\nnatural bridge, well worth a visit and sufficiently near Mill Cave for\r\nboth to be seen on the same trip.\r\n\r\nIn Bread Tray Mountain there is supposed to be a cave through which a\r\ntorrent rushes at times, that being the only way in which to explain the\r\nstrange thundering, roaring noise always heard after a storm, and never\r\nat other times.\r\n\r\nBesides being a wonderful cave region, and rich in the great abundance\r\nand variety of native fruits and fine timber, Stone County has a vast\r\namount of mineral wealth, the heaviest deposits being zinc, lead and\r\niron, with some indications of silver, gold and copper, which have been\r\nfound but not in paying quantity. Already since the summer of 1896\r\nseveral exceptionally pure bodies of zinc have been discovered, the\r\nwhite ore of one recently opened deposit giving highly gratifying\r\nindications as to extent. Prospecting may be said to have only commenced\r\nin this very far from over-crowded region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOREGON COUNTY CAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREER SPRING.\r\n\r\nOregon County is also at the extreme southern limit of the State of\r\nMissouri and was visited, not because its caves are supposed to be\r\neither finer or more numerous than those of all the other Ozark\r\ncounties, but on account of remarkable attractions associated with them\r\nthat are not known to be equaled, or even subject to rivalry, by any\r\nsimilar works of nature in any portion of the world.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient railway point is Thayer; the station hotel affords\r\ncomfortable accommodations for headquarters, and the last days of\r\nSeptember proved a charming time. The foliage was in full summer glory,\r\nrefreshed by a gentle and copious rain, and the insinuating tick had\r\nalready retired from active business until the following season.\r\n\r\nThe carriage having been ordered on condition of its being a clear day,\r\nwe left Thayer at eight o'clock on a perfect morning to visit Greer\r\nSpring, and were soon in the depth of the beautiful Ozark forest, from\r\nwhich we did not once emerge until Alton, the county seat, was reached,\r\nthe distance traveled being sixteen miles. Here we stopped for dinner at\r\nthe small hotel kept by one of the old-time early settlers who came to\r\nthe region before the war. The dinner was a surprise, and received the\r\nhighest commendation possible to a dinner, the hearty appreciation of a\r\nboy. A young nephew, Arthur J. Owen, having been invited to act as\r\nescort on the trip, found all the varied experience in cave hunting\r\nfully equal to the pictured joys of anticipation. After a large bell\r\nsuspended somewhere outside had notified the business public that dinner\r\nwas ready to be served, we were invited to the dining-room, where on a\r\nlong table was the abundance of vegetables afforded by the season and\r\nsoil of an almost tropical state, and cooked as the white-capped chef of\r\nthe great hotel, where the warm weeks were spent, had not learned the\r\nsecret of; and the delicately fried chicken was not of that curious\r\nvariety, commonly encountered by travelers, in which the development of\r\nlegs robs the centiped of his only claim to distinction. As the dishes\r\ncooled they were removed and fresh supplies brought in.\r\n\r\nOur driver received directions about the road and we started on another\r\ndrive of seven miles. These directions were \"to follow the main road to\r\nthe forks, and then keep to the Van Buren road and any one could tell\r\nus where Captain Greer lives.\"\r\n\r\nThe road was, as before, through the park-like forest, and as before,\r\nlay chiefly along the ridge, so that where clearings had been made for\r\nfarms there were fine views over the distant country, which everywhere\r\nwas forest-covered hills, of a rich green near at hand but changing with\r\nthe growth of distance, first to dark, and then to lighter blue.\r\n\r\nIn these forests were fine young cattle and horses, and uncounted\r\nnumbers of \"razorbacks,\" or as they are otherwise called,\r\n\"wind-splitters.\" For the benefit of those who may not be familiar with\r\nthe names, it might be well to explain that they are the natural heirs\r\nof the native wild hog of Missouri and Arkansas. The nephew was greatly\r\namused at seeing many of them with wooden yokes on their long necks, to\r\nprevent an easy entrance into fields and gardens by squeezing through\r\nthe spaces between fence rails. These animals are such swift runners it\r\nis said they can safely cross the railroad between trucks of the fast\r\nexpress. Their snouts are so long and thin, it is also claimed that two\r\ncan drink from a jug at the same time; never having seen it done,\r\nhowever, this is not vouched for, but merely repeated as hearsay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wilderness Pinery, Oregon Co. Page 84.]\r\n\r\nAfter a time we stopped to inquire the way of an old man dipping water\r\nfrom a pond by the roadside. He told us he was dipping water to wash\r\nthe wheat he was sowing in the field just over the fence, and that we\r\nreach the forks, then to keep the Van Buren road, pass two houses on the\r\nleft, a white one on the right, another on the left and then inquire the\r\nway--anyone could tell us, and Captain Greer would show us to the\r\nSpring, \"for he is a mighty accommodating man.\"\r\n\r\nOn we went to the forks where in the point of the Y stood a large tree\r\nwith a Van Buren sign-board on one side, and in the direction it\r\npointed, we turned, although rather reluctantly, for it looked little\r\nused and rocky, while the other was in good condition; but we followed\r\nthe sign-board and had no misgivings until it began to be realized that\r\na great deal of time was being passed but no houses. The morning had\r\nbeen very chilly, but now the atmosphere was just at that balmy point\r\nbetween warm and cool that makes mere living an unqualified luxury; and\r\nadded to this we soon found ourselves in a deep cañon no less beautiful\r\nthan the justly celebrated North Cheyenne Cañon near Colorado Springs.\r\n\r\nThere was now no doubt that we were on the wrong road, but such\r\nmagnificence was unexpected and not to be turned from with indifference.\r\n\r\nFor some distance the road makes a gradual and rather perilous looking\r\ndescent along the steep and broken slope on the shady side of the\r\nancient river's great retaining-wall, while that opposite is glorified\r\nby the brilliant glow of the afternoon sun, which adds an equal charm to\r\nthe rich, luxuriant foliage below and the tall stately pines that adorn,\r\nwithout concealing, the grey rock they proudly cling to, or that rises\r\nin a protecting rampart three hundred feet higher than the cañon bed,\r\nwith banners of the long-needled pine waving above to proclaim the\r\nperfection of Nature's undisturbed freedom.\r\n\r\nThe road descending crosses the thread of water still flowing among the\r\ngreat rounded bowlders left by the former torrent, and our view is\r\nchanged to one of dense, but by no means melancholy, shadows, with a\r\ncrown of golden sunlight; and presently the course of the cañon turns to\r\nthe east, and it is all filled with the yellow rays and we notice the\r\nbright red hawthorn berries, and masses of hydrangea still showing\r\nremnants of their late profusion of bloom. We Missourians have a great\r\nlove of fine scenery and generally take long journeys into other states\r\nin order to gratify the taste, while quite unconscious of the wonderful\r\nbeauty and grandeur of the Ozarks.\r\n\r\nWhere the cañon begins to broaden into a small sheltered valley as it\r\napproaches Eleven Points River, we turned and retraced our way to the\r\nforks, and a short distance beyond to a house where we might again\r\ninquire. A woman came to the open door as we stopped and in answer to a\r\nquestion said: \"You ought to have asked me when you passed here a while\r\nago.\"\r\n\r\nApologies for the seeming neglect were offered and accepted, then she\r\nexplained that both roads went to Van Buren but not to Greer Spring,\r\nwhere in due time we at length arrived.\r\n\r\nThe house being in one corner of a \"forty\" and the spring in that\r\ndiagonally opposite, there was a walk of nearly that distance before\r\ncoming to an old road inclining steeply down into what looked to be a\r\nnarrow cañon. About midway of this sloping road, the space confined\r\nbetween perpendicular walls, rising to heights above on one side and\r\ndescending to the stream on the other, widens suddenly and a picturesque\r\nold mill comes into view, it having been wholly screened from the\r\napproach by the rich growth of shrubs and trees. Chief in abundance\r\namong this luxury of leaf was the hydrangea,--a favorite shrub largely\r\nimported into this country from Japan before it was discovered as a\r\nnative. The mill site seems to have been selected for its beauty\r\nalthough we were told that at this point the stream is seventy-two feet\r\nwide, and two and one half feet deep, but could be raised thirty feet\r\nwith perfect safety by a dam, for which the rock is already on the\r\nground and much of it broken ready for use. The flow is said to be two\r\nhundred and eighty yards per minute, with no appreciable variation, and\r\nnever freezes. The high walls of the Greer Spring gorge will, of course,\r\nfar more than double the value it would otherwise possess, when it\r\nbecomes desirable to control and turn to practical account the power now\r\ngoing so cheerily to waste, but the artistic loss will be\r\nproportionately severe.\r\n\r\nThe old mill was the scene of great activity in former times, but was\r\nclosed on account of an unfortunate accident and for years has had no\r\nother duty than simply to serve as a portion of the landscape.\r\n\r\nJust beyond, the cañon makes a curving bend, the road dwindles to a\r\nnarrow path and we behold the most beautiful scene imaginable.\r\n\r\nThe cañon has come to an end and is shut in by a graceful curve of the\r\nhigh, perpendicular grey walls that are crowned with trees and shrubs,\r\nand decked below with a thick carpet of bright green moss. In this\r\nbasin, which is nearly one hundred feet across, Greer Spring plunges up\r\nfrom beneath through an opening nine feet in diameter, in the midst of a\r\npool of water six feet deep, and having an unvarying temperature of\r\nforty-nine degrees throughout the year. This water is so perfectly clear\r\nthat not the least pebble is obscured from view, and the color scheme is\r\nmost marvelous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Greer Spring. Page 88.]\r\n\r\nWhere the great spring forces its way to the surface, the water is a\r\ndeep, brilliant blue with white caps, and its falling weight keeps clear\r\nof moss a large spot of fine, pure, white sandstone, while all the\r\nbalance appears a vivid green from the moss that thrives beneath the\r\nmoving water; and surrounding these are the handsome, foliage-decked\r\ngrey walls. The edges of the basin are thickly strewn with fallen rocks\r\ndeeply covered with moss, in which small ferns are growing, and on these\r\ngay stepping stones we crossed to the head-wall of the cañon to find\r\nourselves at the open mouth of a cave from which flows a clear, shallow\r\nstream to join the waters of the Spring in that wonderful basin. The\r\nentrance to the cave is an arch about fifteen feet wide and twelve feet\r\nhigh, with the clear, shallow stream spreading over the clean rock floor\r\nfrom side to side. Here now was presented a difficulty. Truly the cave\r\nwas _not_ quite dry. The water was about ten inches deep, and my boots\r\nin Thayer. Contrary to advice, however, my nephew had brought his, and\r\nwith a boy's kindness loaned them while he made the trip with bare feet\r\nand rolled up trousers.\r\n\r\nA short distance within, the cave widens and the floor of the extension\r\nbeing somewhat higher, is dry, but the roof drops so low over it that\r\nthe water-course is an easier route of travel; and this soon widens\r\ninto a lake above which the ceiling rises in a broad dome less than\r\ntwenty feet in height, and hung with heavy masses of dripstone draperies\r\nof varying length, from five to seven feet; and all the ceilings are\r\nfringed at various heights with stalactites of every size and age, some\r\nbeing a clear, colorless onyx, while others proclaim their great age in\r\nthe fact that they have so deteriorated that the onyx texture is either\r\npartly or completely lost, and what was once a pure drip crystal has\r\nreturned to a common, porous, dull-colored limestone so soft that\r\nportions can be rubbed to powder in the hand.\r\n\r\nPicking the way carefully as the depth of the lovely lake increased, we\r\nfollowed the sound of falling water and peered into the dark distance in\r\na vain effort to see it, yet expecting to reach that special object of\r\ninterest by keeping to the shallower parts of the lake. These\r\nexpectations were shattered suddenly when the boots filled with water,\r\nand that called to mind the fact that twenty-three miles and a chilly\r\nnight lay between us and dry clothing; so we returned to the outside\r\nworld and rested on the rocks where Captain Greer and our young driver\r\nwaited for us. The cave has never been fully explored, and probably we\r\npenetrated farther than others have ever done, as the owner knew\r\nnothing of the falling water we so distinctly heard and were surely very\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nThe view from the rocks is wonderfully beautiful and includes both the\r\nentrance to the cave, with its flowing stream, and the receiving basin\r\nwith its bounding stream. But it was growing late in the afternoon, and\r\nthere was another cave whose entrance was in the perpendicular wall\r\nabove the end of the path by which we had come. This entrance could be\r\nreached by a dilapidated ladder; assisted by a forked pole and supplied\r\nwith candles and matches, my nephew and I achieved the ascent with not\r\nmuch trouble. Here we found what is, no doubt, one of the oldest caves\r\nknown.\r\n\r\nThe original cavity is nearly filled up with masses of onyx--colorless\r\ncrystal and white striped with pale shades of grey. The cave is\r\nperfectly dry and freshly broken surfaces in some places show signs of\r\ndeterioration, so how can we venture even a guess as to the time it has\r\nrequired to first excavate the cave and then fill it with masses of rock\r\ndeposited by the slow drip process, and later, for that crystalline rock\r\nin a now dry atmosphere to present a perceptible weakening? We went as\r\nfar as passages could be crawled into, which was no great distance, and\r\nat once started on our uncertain descent of the ladder; but this was not\r\na matter of so much concern as the upward trip, for the success of\r\nwhich some doubts were entertained; for going down is always naturally a\r\nless certain matter, as one can fall if more desirable means are\r\nunsuccessful, and I have unexpectedly reached many coveted points in\r\nthis simple manner.\r\n\r\nTaking a last look at Greer Spring with its cave river, grey walls, gay\r\nwith foliage, and all the harmony of color and form combined in the\r\nnarrow cañon that was once the main body of a great cave, I recalled\r\nviews on the Hudson River and in the mountains of Maryland, Virginia and\r\nPennsylvania, and others out in the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and the\r\nWausatch in Utah, but amid all their wonderful grandeur and famous\r\nbeauty, could remember no spot superior to this masterpiece of the\r\nOzarks.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the Spring and a thousand acres of land adjacent, took\r\npersonal possession on the day of Lincoln's first election, to establish\r\na home.\r\n\r\nThe sun having failed to consider our wishes was now about to disappear\r\nin a gleaming flood of gold, so the return to Thayer that night was out\r\nof the question. Our host and his wife observed that fact and cordially\r\ninvited us to remain for the night and as much longer as we would like\r\nto, but being unwilling to impose on kindness to such an extent, we\r\nreturned to the hotel in Alton, and now urgently advise that those who\r\never have an opportunity to enjoy a moonlight drive through the Ozark\r\nforests should not let it pass unimproved.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER CAVES NEAR BY.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve miles from Alton there are three other caves worthy of\r\nattention. Two of these are known only as The Saltpetre Caves, and the\r\nthird as The Bat Cave.\r\n\r\nNot many persons care to visit the Bat Cave, for although its\r\ninhabitants are small, they have evidently decided to profit by the\r\nexperience of the Red Man and take no risks through hospitality. Their\r\nwarnings can be heard like distant thunder for some distance outside the\r\ncave, and any unheeding intruder is set upon in fury by such vast\r\nnumbers of the little creatures that his only safety is in hasty\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the two Saltpetre Caves were worked to a considerable\r\nextent, and also served as safe retreats for the residents of the\r\nregion, as well as the visiting \"Jonny,\" when the vicinity became\r\noppressively \"blue.\"\r\n\r\nBoth of these caves are especially notable on account of the fine\r\nstalactites with which they are abundantly supplied; most of them being\r\nsnow white and from fourteen to twenty feet in length.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, most of the caves in this region have been deprived of\r\ngreat quantities of their beautiful adornments by visitors who are\r\nallowed to choose the best and remove it in such quantities as may suit\r\ntheir convenience and pleasure. Those who own the caves, and those who\r\nvisit them, would do well to remember that if all the natural adornment\r\nshould be allowed to remain in its original position, it would continue\r\nto afford pleasure to many persons for an indefinite time; but if\r\nbroken, removed, and scattered the pleasure to a few will be\r\ncomparatively little and that short-lived. The gift of beauty should\r\nalways be honored and protected for the public good.\r\n\r\nWe were not so fortunate as to discover fossils of any kind in this\r\nlocality, although the search was by no means thorough; but even if it\r\nhad been the result might have been the same, since that county and\r\nothers adjoining have been mapped as Cambrian. The greater part of the\r\nexposed rock is a fine sandstone almost as white as gypsum on a fresh\r\nfracture, and much of it is ripple-marked so as to show a beautifully\r\nfluted surface of remarkable regularity. These ripple flutings are\r\nsometimes more than an inch in width, and often less, but the variations\r\nnever appear on the same level, the smallest being seen on the hill-tops\r\nand the larger outcropping on the downward slopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND GULF.\r\n\r\n\r\nOregon County, Missouri, is also fortunate in having within its limits\r\nthe Grand Gulf, which has been declared by competent judges to be one of\r\nthe wonders of the world; and it offers a combination of attractions\r\nthat certainly entitles it to an important place among a limited few of\r\nAmerica's choicest scenes.\r\n\r\nThe Gulf is nearly nine miles northwest of Thayer, Missouri, and about\r\nequally distant from Mammoth Spring in Arkansas, just a little south of\r\nthe Missouri state line. The drive is a pleasant one, as the road winds\r\namong the forest-clad hills and passes occasional fields of cotton and\r\ncorn; but having been macadamized in very ancient times by the original\r\nand all-powerful general government of that early period is somewhat\r\nrough, yet threatens no danger greater than the destruction of wheels.\r\n\r\nThe only approach to the Gulf is over the hill-tops; and the entrance in\r\npast times, while it was still a cave, must have been a sink-hole in the\r\nroof of the largest chamber. This chamber is now the upper end of the\r\nGrand Gulf, and into it we descended by a rugged path, sufficiently\r\ndifficult to maintain expectations of grandeur that are not doomed to\r\ndisappointment. The precipitous walls, two hundred feet in height, bear\r\na faithful record of the energy of circling floods; but instead of\r\nfrowning, as some good people persistently accuse all noble heights of\r\ndoing, they seem to look with conscious pride towards the windings of\r\nthe great rough chasm, where every available spot has been seized on as\r\na homestead for some form of vegetation. All the great, dark rock masses\r\nthat interfere with easy progress along the lowest depth, were\r\nsurrounded by a feathery setting of blooming white agaratum; and each\r\nturn in the winding course reveals new charms of rock and verdure with\r\ntheir varying lights and shadows until the crowning glory is reached at\r\nthe Natural Bridge, about twelve hundred feet from the upper end of the\r\ncañon. This bridge is magnificent. It was impossible to secure\r\nphotographs because the abrupt curve by which it is approached gave no\r\npoint of view for a small camera; and it was equally impossible to reach\r\ndesirable points for taking measurements, but the open arch is not less\r\nthan twenty feet wide and considerably more than that in height. From\r\nthe floor or bed of the Gulf to the road that crosses the bridge is more\r\nthan two hundred feet. The passage under the bridge makes a curve, the\r\nshortest side of which measures exactly two hundred and nineteen feet,\r\nand as the width varies from twenty to forty feet, the other side is\r\nlonger. Most of the floor is flat and level as also is the ceiling, the\r\ngreatest irregularities being along the wall of greater length which\r\nshows at what points the rushing water has spent its force. No water\r\nflows through here now except in times of heavy rainfall. The other end\r\nof the bridge has a somewhat smaller span but is very handsome, and the\r\noutward views from both are exceedingly fine. After traversing about\r\nfour hundred feet more of the beautiful, high-walled Gulf, we stood\r\nbefore the grand entrance to the cave, which is strikingly similar to\r\nthe first arch of the bridge. The only picture I was able to get was\r\ntaken from the slope of the Bridge-crown, one hundred feet below the\r\nroad, and merely gives a suggestion of the magnificence waiting\r\npeacefully for the crowds of eager and enthusiastic sight-seers who will\r\nin the near future rush to this charming region in the \"Land of the Big\r\nRed Apple.\"\r\n\r\nMy companions were the same as mentioned in the preceding chapter, a\r\nnephew, James Arther Owen, and an obliging, tall young man of twenty,\r\nwho acted as guide and driver.\r\n\r\nRelieving ourselves of all superfluous burdens just within the cave\r\nentrance, we lighted candles and sat down to wait for our eyes to\r\nadjust themselves to the changed condition, from brilliant sunlight to\r\nabsolute darkness, broken only by the feeble strength of three candles.\r\nIt was noticeable that in the moist atmosphere of the Missouri caves,\r\nthree candles were not more than equal to one in the dry caves of South\r\nDakota.\r\n\r\nVery soon we were able to continue the inspection of our surroundings,\r\nand the large passage we were in would more properly be called a long\r\nchamber, of irregular width but averaging about thirty feet. This ends\r\nabruptly nearly five hundred feet from the entrance, but a small passage\r\nscarcely more than six feet high runs off at right angles, and into this\r\nwe turn. It is not quite so nearly dry as the outer chamber, and at a\r\ndistance of less than one hundred feet we suddenly come to the end of\r\ndry land at an elbow of the silently flowing river whose channel we had\r\nalmost stepped into. The ceiling dipped so we were not able to stand\r\nstraight, and the guide said he had never gone farther; but to his\r\nsurprise here was a light boat which I am ready to admit he displayed no\r\neagerness to appropriate to his own use, and swimming about it, close to\r\nshore, were numerous small, eyeless fish, pure white and perfectly\r\nfearless; the first I had ever seen, and little beauties.\r\n\r\nBy burning magnesium ribbon we saw that the passage before us was a low\r\narch and occupied from wall to wall by water, the direction of the flow\r\nbeing into another of somewhat greater size at right angles to that by\r\nwhich we had come, and at the mouth of this lay the boat. The distance\r\nwe could see in either direction was of tantalizing shortness, and the\r\nboat was provided with no means of guidance or control, save an\r\nabundance of slender twine which secured it to a log of drift from the\r\noutside; so I decided to leave my companions in charge of the main coil\r\nof twine while I went on an excursion alone, there being not much\r\nevident cause for apprehension as no living cow could ever have made the\r\ntrip to this favored spot.\r\n\r\nAlthough the water looked perfectly placid, the boat drifted with\r\nsurprising speed, so that the two scared faces peering after me were\r\nsoon lost sight of. The channel was nowhere more than six feet wide,\r\nconsequently as the boat inclined to drive against either wall I was\r\nable with care to keep it off the rocks with my hands, and in the same\r\nway guide it around the sharp turns in safety. After several of these\r\nturns there appeared the mouth of a passage so much smaller that the\r\nroof was only twelve inches above the sides of the boat and I could\r\ntouch both walls at the same time. By running the boat across this it\r\nwas held in place by the current, and I could sit at ease and enjoy the\r\nposition, which even the least imaginative person can readily conceive\r\nto have been a novel one.\r\n\r\nThe small eyeless fish had been noticeable in the water everywhere but\r\nnow came swimming about the boat in an astonishing multitude, and as\r\nunconscious of any possible danger as bees in a flower garden. Having no\r\neyes, they were naturally undisturbed by the light, so the candle could\r\nbe held close to the water for a satisfactory examination of the happy\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nThey bore a striking resemblance to minnows, although a few were larger,\r\nand it is claimed that four or five inches are sizes not unusual, but\r\nthey happened not to be on exhibition. Even dipping a hand into the\r\nwater in their midst occasioned no alarm, and they might have been\r\ncaught by dozens.\r\n\r\nThe guide now loudly called that he had fears of the twine being cut on\r\nthe sharp edges of rock, and that cutting off all possibility of the\r\nboat's return, which being sufficiently reasonable, explorations were\r\nindefinitely suspended, and a landing soon made. The camera and\r\nflash-light were then prepared for taking a view, and a point of light\r\nbeing needed to work by the nephew was asked to sit in the boat with his\r\ncandle, to which he readily consented; but judging from the developed\r\npicture it may be doubted if his pleasure at the time was extremely\r\nkeen.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the cave the guide said it would not be necessary to return\r\nto the upper end of the Gulf in order to reach the surface, as the\r\nascent could be made in another place; and leading the way to the left\r\nof the entrance he started up the nearly perpendicular wall, more than\r\ntwo hundred feet high, by a sort of \"blind trail\" that would have caused\r\na mountain sheep to sigh for wings, but it was very beautiful.\r\n\r\nWe walked over to the wagon road on the high ridge above the middle of\r\nthe bridge and going down the forest-clad slopes to the perpendicular\r\nwall in which is the smaller of the great arches, admired from this fair\r\npoint of view the marvelous grandeur of one of the greatest natural\r\nwonders.\r\n\r\nThe weather being perfect after a rain the day before, there was no need\r\nof haste to get indoors, so we lingered into the afternoon and then\r\ndrove to the Mammoth Spring, in Arkansas, a short distance south of the\r\nMissouri state line, where the Cave River, just visited, comes to the\r\nsurface in a bounding spring of great force. The distance being little\r\nless than nine miles.\r\n\r\nThe basin filled by the Spring might be called a lake, as its size of\r\ntwo hundred by three hundred feet gives it that appearance, and the\r\ncolor is a remarkable deep blue. The volume of water is so nearly\r\nuniform that the height seldom varies more than two or three inches,\r\nbut three years ago a storm of unusual violence carried out most of the\r\nnative fish, and in restocking from Government supplies, the clear, cold\r\nwater suggested an experiment with mountain trout which are found to be\r\ndoing well.\r\n\r\nWhere Mammoth Spring flows out its power is utilized by a flour mill on\r\none bank and a cotton mill on the other, and the water flowing on forms\r\nSpring River, well known for the charm of its beautiful scenery.\r\n\r\nThis Spring is described by Dr. David Dale Owen in his First Report of a\r\nGeological Reconnoissance of the northern counties of Arkansas, 1857 and\r\n1858, pp. 60-61.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK HILLS AND BAD LANDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to thoroughly appreciate and enjoy the wonderful caves of South\r\nDakota, which are found within the limits of the Black Hills, it is\r\nnecessary to have some knowledge of the geological character and history\r\nof that peculiar region.\r\n\r\nProf. J.E. Todd, State Geologist, in his \"Preliminary Report on the\r\nGeology of South Dakota,\" gives an interesting \"Historical Sketch of\r\nExplorations\" in his state, beginning with the expedition of Captains\r\nLewis and Clark to the upper Missouri regions in 1804-6 to explore that\r\nportion of the recent Louisiana Purchase for the government and notify\r\nthe Indians of the transfer; and including all other important\r\nexpeditions since that time down to his own official tour of the Black\r\nHills and Bad Lands in 1894. His own descriptions are so concise and\r\ngraphic as to invite quotation. Of the Hills he says:\r\n\r\n\"The Black Hills have an area of five-thousand square miles of a rudely\r\nelliptical form with its major axis, approximately, north-northwest.\r\nMost of this area lies within our state. The true limit of the Hills is\r\nquite distinctly marked by a sharp ridge of sandstone, three hundred to\r\nsix hundred feet in relative height, which becomes broader and more\r\nplateau-like towards the north and south ends. This ridge is separated\r\nfrom the higher mass of hills within by a valley one to three miles in\r\nbreadth, which is known as the Red Valley, from its brick-red soil, or\r\nthe 'race course,' which name was given it by the Indians because of its\r\nopen and smooth character, affording easy and rapid passage around the\r\nHills. The junction of the outer base of the Hills with the surrounding\r\ntable lands has an altitude of three thousand, five hundred to four\r\nthousand feet. Within this Red Valley one gradually ascends the outer\r\nslope of the Hills and soon enters, at an altitude of four thousand five\r\nhundred or five thousand feet, the woody portion of the region. This\r\nouter slope varies greatly in width and is underlaid by older\r\nsedimentary rocks, cut in almost every direction by narrow deep cañons.\r\nThis feature covers nearly the whole of the western half of the Hills\r\nproper, where erosion has been less active on account of its distance\r\nfrom the main channels of drainage. Usually, from the broken interior\r\nedge of this slope or sedimentary plateau one descends a bluff or\r\nescarpment, and enters the central area of slates, granite, and\r\nquartzites, which is carved into high ridges and sharp peaks cut by many\r\nnarrow and deep valleys and ravines and generally thickly timbered with\r\nthe common pine of the Rocky Mountains. Toward the south, about Harney\r\nPeak, the surface is peculiarly rugged and difficult to traverse. Toward\r\nthe north, also, about Terry and Custer peaks, a smaller rugged surface\r\nappears; but in the central area between and extending west of the\r\nHarney range is a region which is characterized by open and level parks\r\nmuch lower than the surrounding peaks and ridges.\"\r\n\r\nThe Archæan rocks which form the core of the Hills mark the center of\r\nthe various uplifts which have attended their formation and controlled\r\ntheir history. The coarse granite of Harney Peak indicating that, as the\r\ncentral point of the earliest upheaval, and the three porphyries known\r\nas rhyolite, trachyte, and phonolite, showing the uplifts of later\r\nperiods to have had their centers a little more to the north, but the\r\nentire area is said to be only about sixty miles long and twenty-five\r\nmiles in width. It is exceptionally rough and mountainous, and\r\nconsequently has great charms for the lover of fine scenery. Erosion has\r\nonly partially denuded the peaks of the sedimentary rocks through which\r\nthey were thrust up, or by which they were overlaid during the earlier\r\npart of several subsequent periods of submersion. The Hills, in these\r\nremote times, led but a doubtful and precarious existence, being now an\r\nisolated island rising out of a shallow sea, and then, owing to a\r\ngeneral subsidence, submerged in the ocean to so great a depth that even\r\nHarney Peak is supposed to have almost, if not entirely, disappeared.\r\nThis up and down motion continued at intervals until the Fox Hills epoch\r\nof the Cretaceous Age, at the close of which the sea retired forever\r\nfrom that portion of the country. In the next epoch fresh water work\r\nbegan and extensive marshes were formed, with an abundant growth of\r\nvegetation and reptiles. There was also much volcanic violence which\r\nresulted in the fine scenery in the north end of the Black Hills, and\r\nprobably opened the fissures to form Wind Cave, the Onyx Caves in the\r\nsouthern hills and Crystal Cave near the eastern edge toward the north.\r\nThis was near the close of the Cretaceous Age. But here is a point on\r\nwhich the best authorities who have studied the porphyry peaks, have\r\nfailed to agree; Prof. N.H. Winchell believing that the intrusion\r\noccurred, probably, during the Jura Trias, but as Cretaceous beds, of\r\nmore recent date, are found to have been distorted by the outflow, it\r\nseems that Professors Todd, Newton and Carpenter hold the stronger\r\nposition and that the later time is correct.\r\n\r\nNo record of the next geological stage, which was the Eocene, or earlier\r\npart of the Tertiary Age, has been found in the Hills, because they were\r\nat that time dry land with gently flowing, shallow streams, and\r\nconsequently no strata were laid down; but they are supposed, through\r\nlater evidences, to have had a tropical climate and vegetation, enjoyed\r\nby large animals of strange new forms. The volume of fresh water\r\nafterwards became so great that immense lakes spread over large portions\r\nof the west, one of which occupied most of the region around the Black\r\nHills at the beginning of the Miocene, and animal life was more abundant\r\nthan ever before and of higher orders, many species being the same as\r\nare now in existence. The weather became more and more inclement and as\r\nthe storms increased the erosion of the Hills also increased, and the\r\nrivers changed to torrents with deep channels. Earthquakes are supposed\r\nto have occurred and also volcanic eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe Black Hills were now rising steadily, and as the slope of the\r\nstreams increased, the channels cut deeper, and the fissures now known\r\nas caves had long been filled with water.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the numerous animals of the Tertiary Age yet\r\ndiscovered in the Hills and surrounding region, are the Titanotherium or\r\nBrontotherium, similar to our Hippopotamus, the Oreodon, and a small\r\nhorse having three toes on each foot. A little later in the same Age\r\nthe horses were similar to those of the present time and of equal size,\r\nwhich proves that the wild horses of the West were not descended from\r\nthe few lost by the Spanish Invaders. At this time the first lions,\r\ncamels, mastodons, and mammoths also appeared. The remains of these\r\nanimals are so abundant in places as to indicate that they perished in\r\nherds that were overwhelmed suddenly by great floods, and many, no\r\ndoubt, huddled together and perished with cold; for with the beginning\r\nof the present age the Hills had reached their highest elevation, the\r\ninclement weather increased, and the tropical climate suddenly changed\r\nto one extremely cold. It was the beginning of the Glacial Period or Ice\r\nAge, when a large portion of the United States is supposed to have been\r\ncovered by a sheet of ice. The ice is believed to have entered South\r\nDakota from the northeast and its drift across the state limited by a\r\nline so closely following the present course of the Missouri River that\r\nmany of us would be inclined to consider it the western bluff. Beyond\r\nthis line the ice failed to push its way, but the Hills were subject to\r\nheavy rain storms that filled the streams and carried large quantities\r\nof bowlders and other eroded material, both coarse and fine, down into\r\nthe valleys and over the lower hills, where much of the moderately\r\ncoarse can now be seen exposed on the surface, and fine specimens\r\ncollected without the use of a hammer. The brilliantly colored, striped\r\nand mottled agates, and the bright, delicate tints of the quartz\r\ncrystal, are particularly attractive to the majority of visitors. The\r\nbeauty of these gaily colored rocks is quite extensively utilized by the\r\ninhabitants of the southern and southeastern hills to supply the place\r\nof growing plants which are generally denied by the inconvenience of the\r\nwater supply. The quartzite of the Hills is well crystallized and heavy.\r\nI have one beautiful specimen of the dark Indian red variety through\r\nwhich passes a narrow line of pale blue, and the yellow quartzite or\r\njasper sometimes shows dendrite markings. Very great quantities of\r\nagates and jasper, mostly in small pieces, but unlimited variety, are to\r\nbe seen in portions of the Bad Lands, south of the fork of the Cheyenne\r\nRiver, with an almost equal abundance of baculites and numerous other\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nThe wide expanse of deep ravines and sharp, barren ridges in the Bad\r\nLands is a unique departure from the usual phases of natural scenery\r\nthat inspire interest and wonder, but no great admiration, until one\r\nsoon learns that the law of compensation has been strictly observed. The\r\nbeauty of vegetation denied those desolate buttes and ridges is atoned\r\nfor by a marvelous abundance of most wonderful crystals of aragonite,\r\ncalcite, barite and satin spar; each to itself, or two or more combined\r\nin beautiful geodes or else arranged in great flat slabs crystallized on\r\nboth sides of a thin sheet of lime. These slabs are composed of crystals\r\nof uniform size and of a pale green tint. But the geodes show some\r\nstriking combinations of both crystals and colors with an exterior\r\nformed like box work, composed of a very heavy dark material said to be\r\na mixture of barium, calcium and iron. The interior may be a bright\r\ngreen or lemon yellow, or perhaps the two in combination, while others\r\nyet may be either of these varieties with the addition of flat crystals\r\nof almost transparent satin spar. These crystals also occur in masses of\r\nthe same box-like formation rising just so much above the surface of the\r\nbarren ridge they occupy as to give it the appearance of a prairie dog\r\ntown. One hill-top over which an abundance of detached crystals, of the\r\npalest water-green tint, has been spread, gave the impression of being\r\ncovered with crushed ice. This transformation from a richly tropical to\r\na marvelously barren region, was accomplished during the time when\r\nstorms reigned over the Hills and ice ruled the country to the north and\r\neast.\r\n\r\nThe long slender barite crystals of a bright golden brown color are\r\nespecially beautiful but are generally seen in the specimen stores, as\r\nthe deposit is confined to limited areas and the few persons familiar\r\nwith the locations are not over anxious to introduce the general public.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains previously referred to are of course only a few of\r\nthe most important, but it is remarked as a curious and notable fact\r\nthat among the fossils of the lower orders of life in the Bad Lands, the\r\nheads have not been preserved. On account of scarcity of water it is\r\nnecessary for parties to carry a supply even when they expect to be in\r\nthe vicinity of the Cheyenne River and probably ford the South fork, as\r\nthese waters carry in solution a quantity of alkali that renders them\r\nunfit for drinking, although the effects would not be fatal but simply\r\nthe extreme reverse of pleasant.\r\n\r\nNo caves have been discovered in the Bad Lands, unless that name be\r\napplied to some of the geodes which are really grottoes, they being of\r\nsufficient size for a man to stand in. The Black Hills, however, contain\r\nsome of the most remarkable caves ever yet discovered, of which those of\r\ngreatest importance are Wind Cave and the three Onyx Caves near Hot\r\nSprings, in the southeastern part of the Hills, and Crystal Cave near\r\nPiedmont, in the northeast. All of these occur in the Carboniferous\r\nLimestone which forms an outer belt around the central mass or core of\r\nthe Hills and no doubt, as previously suggested, owes its fissures to\r\nearthquakes which preceded or accompanied the porphyry intrusions by\r\nwhich in some localities its strata have been thrown into a vertical\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWIND CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWind Cave was discovered in 1881 by a hunter named Thomas Bingham, who\r\nbeing weary of a fruitless chase sat down to rest, and was soon startled\r\nby the sound of rushing wind on a calm day; and at the same time by a\r\nsingular hair-raising sensation, as his hat was lifted from his head and\r\nthrown high in the air. He is said to have afterwards declared that\r\nalthough frightened nearly out of his wits, he determined to find the\r\ncause of his alarm, and on turning slightly discovered a hole about\r\neight by twelve inches in size through which a roaring wind was issuing\r\nfrom the earth. As his hair maintained the aggressive attitude taken,\r\nthe recovered hat could not be returned to its usual place, so an hour\r\nwas spent in laying it across the opening and watching its instant\r\nprojection into upper space; after which he set out to tell of the\r\nwonderful discovery. The announcement, however, was not received\r\nseriously and he was assured of the impossibility of the wind blowing\r\nthrough a hill of solid rock, and his brother explained to him that he\r\nhad been too self-indulgent and consequently imagined the whole affair.\r\nA protest of total abstinence failed to inspire confidence, but the\r\nbrother promised to go the next day to see for himself, and did. The hat\r\nwas again placed over the opening as before, but instead of taking the\r\nexpected lofty flight, it was drawn in and has never since been seen:\r\nthe current had reversed. Soon after this the hole was enlarged to\r\neighteen by thirty inches and the cave entered by quite a number of\r\nventuresome persons assisted by a long rope and ample personal courage.\r\nNo other improvements were made, and only a short distance was explored,\r\nuntil Mr. J.D. McDonald settled on the property in 1890; since which\r\ntime he and his sons have explored ninety-seven miles of passage and\r\ndone such extensive work in opening up small passages and placing\r\nladders, that it is now possible for visitors to travel long distances\r\nwith surprising ease and comfort. The measure of distances in the cave\r\nis not by the usual guess-work method which has established the\r\nshort-measure reputation for cave miles, but is done with a fair degree\r\nof accuracy by means of the twine used to mark the trail in exploring\r\nnew passages. A careful measurement of the twine has shown it to run\r\nnine balls to the mile with a close average of regularity, so it is the\r\ncustom to add another mile to the cave record as often as a ninth ball\r\nbecomes exhausted.\r\n\r\nWind Cave is twelve miles north of Hot Springs by a good road which\r\noffers somewhat meager attractions to the artist, but is more liberal\r\ntowards the geologist, and especially so in fine exposures of the gypsum\r\nbearing Red Beds of the Triassic. Limited patches of it are also exposed\r\nin each of the caves, generally carrying small quantities of selenite,\r\nwhich is crystallized gypsum, or in other words, crystallized sulphate\r\nof lime. This brilliant red color is so prominent in portions of the\r\nHills, and attracts so much wondering attention in other well known\r\nregions of the West, that it would seem an unpardonable neglect of\r\nopportunity should we fail to again quote Prof. Todd for an explanation\r\nof the cause of the vivid coloring. Commencing he says: \"Newton remarks\r\nconcerning this:[4] 'A large percentage of peroxide of iron in the red\r\nbeds, to which they owe their bright red color, bears an interesting\r\nrelation to the absence of fossils. The material of which sediments are\r\nformed is derived, by the various processes of denudation, from the\r\nrocks of older land surfaces. Whatever iron they contain is dissolved\r\nfrom the land and transported in a condition of protoxide and some proto\r\nsalt, such as the carbonate, and the process is facilitated by the\r\npresence of carbonic acid in the water. Now iron occurs in these older\r\nrocks as protoxide and peroxide, the former of which is soluble and the\r\nlatter insoluble in water. The peroxide, however, by the action of\r\norganic matter, such as is held in solution in boggy waters, may be\r\ndeprived of a portion of its oxygen and converted into protoxide and\r\nthus be rendered soluble. If the iron-bearing water is confined first in\r\na shallow basin and exposed long to the action of the atmosphere the\r\nprotoxide of iron absorbs the oxygen and is precipitated as an insoluble\r\nred peroxide of iron. If, however, plant or animal life be present in\r\nsufficient quantities, this oxidation is prevented. In case but little\r\nforeign material, clay or sand, has been brought by the waters, the\r\ndeposit will be an iron ore. In case large quantities of foreign\r\nmaterial are deposited from the waters at the same time, there will be\r\nproduced, in the absence of life, a brown or red clay or sandstone, and\r\nin its presence a white or light colored formation containing the iron\r\nas a carbonate. We reason therefore from the condition in which the iron\r\nis found in the red beds, that there could have been little or no life,\r\nanimal or vegetable, in the water from which it was deposited. The\r\nconclusion is strengthened by the fact of the large quantities of gypsum\r\nwhich are usually derived from the evaporation of saline waters. The\r\ndegree of saline concentration which the precipitation of gypsum\r\nindicates, would be highly inimical to life. The presence of gypsum\r\nhelps to account for the absence of life, and the absence of life\r\naccounts for the brilliant color. The three prominent characteristics of\r\nthe formation (that is the red beds) are therefore quite in harmony with\r\neach other.'\" (Geol. Blk. Hills, p. 138.)\r\n\r\nContinuing the subject, Professor Todd says: \"Accepting this explanation\r\nof the striking red color, the question remains as to how these\r\ncircumstances, favorable for its formation, were produced.\r\n\r\n\"This red color is quite common in the whole Rocky Mountain region, not\r\nonly on the eastern slope of the mountains, but to the various detached\r\nmembers of the system. We must, therefore, look for some extensive\r\ncondition. If we seek some case in the present, parallel to the one\r\nalready indicated, we perhaps can find none better than one on the\r\neastern shore of the Caspian Sea, where, because of dry climate and the\r\nshallow waters, the deposition of gypsum and salt is now going on. In\r\nthe gulf known as the Kara Boghaz, which is separated from the Caspian\r\nby a narrow strait, the evaporation is so rapid as to produce an almost\r\nconstant flow from the sea into it. This strait and this gulf give the\r\nimpression to an unlearned observer that there must be a mysterious\r\nsubterranean outlet. The water flows in, carrying with it the salt and\r\nother soluble minerals. It then evaporates, leaving the salt and\r\nminerals behind.\"\r\n\r\nThis explanation is calculated to afford particular pleasure to the many\r\nvisitors to the Garden of the Gods, in Colorado, who seldom receive\r\nsatisfactory answers to their questions as to the reasons \"why.\" In that\r\nmuch visited spot, however, the great mass of the deposit has been\r\nremoved by erosion and the curiously shaped remnants are only such\r\nportions as were exceptionally hard and consequently withstood the\r\naction of the submerging waters.\r\n\r\nHaving made a considerable stop on the way to Wind Cave, we will now\r\nhurry on, but with good horses and a fine day the drive is one of great\r\npleasure. The road gradually rises to higher ground and soon reaches a\r\npoint six hundred feet more elevated than Hot Springs, with a charming\r\nview of hill and valley distances, and the way then continues over the\r\nhill-tops. At one point by the roadside a circle of tent-stones still\r\nmarks the spot occupied by Sitting Bull for a week or more after the\r\nCuster massacre, while he camped here and in the security of his\r\ncommanding position watched the movements of the government troops who\r\nwere in search of him.\r\n\r\nHot Springs and Buffalo Gap are both included in the wide-spread view.\r\nBeside the road and scattered about in all directions are fine specimens\r\nof agates and quartz crystal which seem most beautiful and most abundant\r\non the hills in the immediate vicinity of the cave, the crystals being\r\neither rose pink, pale green, yellow, white or colorless.\r\n\r\nArriving at the cave, the entrance is not visible, but between the\r\nravine in which it is located and the road, there is the cave office and\r\nsmall hotel, on the ravine side of which an outer stairway leads down to\r\nthe cave entrance, over which has been built a log cabin.\r\n\r\nOn account of the precautions taken for the protection of visitors,\r\naccidents are so rare that it might almost be said that none occur.\r\nEvery person is required to register before entering the cave and all\r\nreturning parties are carefully counted, although they are usually\r\nunaware of the fact. They are always accompanied by two guides and\r\nothers are added if the party is large. No one is, on any account,\r\npermitted to wander in advance of the head guide or linger behind the\r\none in the rear.\r\n\r\nWithin the cabin the immediate entrance to the cave is securely closed,\r\nand in order that the door may not be forced from its fastenings by the\r\nroaring wind which shakes it threateningly, it opens in, instead of out.\r\nThis wind suggested the name Wind Cave, and will probably be utilized,\r\nat no very distant time, to generate electricity for lighting the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nThe wind is strongest at the surface, and a guide goes down first to\r\nplace lights in sheltered nooks where the force has begun to diminish,\r\nabout fifty feet below the entrance; and here we light our candles\r\nwhich, if guarded somewhat, are not extinguished unless the current is\r\nunusually severe. The balance of the descent of one hundred and\r\nfifty-five feet from the surface to the first chamber is easily\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nThis would be the least interesting room in the cave if it were not the\r\nBride's Chamber, on account of having once been the scene of a marriage\r\nceremony. But no others are in need of assistance of such romantic\r\nnature, as all are curiously and handsomely decorated, with such a\r\ncharming variety of deposits, artistically massed, combined or\r\ncontrasted, that every step brings fresh pleasure, and monotony is\r\nnowhere.\r\n\r\nPassing from this room by a long, narrow passage, in the walls of which\r\nare observed many beautiful little pockets of crystals, attention is\r\npresently called to Lincoln's Fireplace, a perfectly natural specimen of\r\nthe old-fashioned design broadly open in the chimney; doubtless just\r\nsuch an one as Mr. Lincoln's good mother hung the crane in and set the\r\nDutch oven before. A little beyond and on the opposite side of the\r\ncrevice is Prairie-dog town, not a very extensive town, to be sure, but\r\nso true a copy that one unfamiliar with the small animal and his style\r\nof architecture would afterwards easily recognize both. At one time his\r\ndogship was carried away by a too eager collector, but a letter to the\r\nsuspected visitor brought him home by the next freight.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch Clock occupies a position on a shelf near by, and all southern\r\nvisitors greet the Alligator as a familiar friend, as all of us joyfully\r\nmeet any acquaintance from home.\r\n\r\nA long narrow passage, formerly a \"tight crawl,\" but later opened up by\r\nheavy blasting, must be traversed before we come to the Snow Ball Room,\r\nbeautiful with round spots of untinted carbonate of lime, as if fresh\r\nsoft snow had been thrown by the handful over walls and ceilings, with\r\nthe additional ornamentation of calcite crystals. In the crevice beyond\r\nrises the Church Steeple, diminishing regularly, though roughly, in\r\nsize, to a height of sixty feet, but not degraded with the little\r\nsquirming stairway usually seen in Church spires.\r\n\r\nThe next room is the Post Office, in which we are for the first time\r\nintroduced to the greatest peculiarity and most abundant formation known\r\nto the cave. Being a newly discovered addition to geology it has no\r\nscientific name and therefore is simply called box work, because it\r\nresembles boxes of many shapes and sizes. The formation of the box work\r\nis generally regarded as an unexplained and unexplainable mystery, but a\r\ncareful study of various portions of the cave shows it in all stages of\r\ndevelopment and suggests a reasonable theory as to the cause of its\r\norigin and variety of development. The volcanic disturbances which have\r\nalready been discussed as having been responsible for the various\r\nuplifts and depressions of the Black Hills region, and also for opening\r\nthe fissures which gave the cave a beginning, must have supplied the\r\nconditions that were necessary to the formation of box work. And these\r\npreliminary conditions were merely cracks in the rock. By the violence\r\nof earth movement the limestone has been crushed, probably when the land\r\nwas undergoing depression, prior to the upheaval which opened the great\r\nparallel fissures. The varying hardness of the rock, as well as\r\nproximity to the surface, would readily account for the difference in\r\nsize of the fractures, which is from one-half inch to twelve inches; the\r\nlargest being the most distant from the surface. That this crushing was\r\ndone before the salt waters retired from the region, which was towards\r\nthe close of the Cretaceous Age, is sufficiently evident in the fact\r\nthat portions of the Red Beds show similar fractures with the cracks\r\nfilled with gypsum, and gypsum, as we have already seen, is a salt\r\nwater deposit.\r\n\r\nAfter the crushing was done the cracks in the Carboniferous Limestone\r\nwere filled with water heavily charged with calcium carbonate, taken in\r\nsolution from the rock, first from pulverized particles, and afterwards\r\nby percolation and contact with exposed surfaces. This calcium carbonate\r\nwas slowly deposited in crystalline form, so that in time the cracks\r\nwere filled and the crushed rock firmly cemented with calcite seams. But\r\nin the meantime the removal of the calcium carbonate had started\r\ndisintegration of the more exposed portions of the rock, which steadily\r\ncontinuing, finally reduced the porous body between the crystal seams to\r\na soft clay which was gradually dissolved and carried out through small\r\nimperfections in the thin crystal sheets, leaving the empty box work as\r\nwe find it. But where blasting has exposed fresh surfaces, much of the\r\nsolid limestone carries the box-like sheets of crystal.\r\n\r\nThe thinnest box work is seen in the upper levels, from which the waters\r\nretired soonest, and the heaviest and most beautiful is in the Blue\r\nGrotto, on the eighth level where the water remained longest and its\r\ndiminished volume became most heavily charged. In many places, however,\r\nthere is another heavy variety known as pop-corn box work, which seems\r\nto be an impure lime carbonate not so finely crystallized as the other,\r\nbut at the time of my visit no explanation had been given of the manner\r\nof its deposit; and my own theory that it was not formed under water had\r\nnothing to sustain it until, a few weeks later, while visiting Crystal\r\nCave, the work was found in active progress on surfaces occupying every\r\nposition, and the agent was dripping water. In all cases the original\r\nbox work has been in thin sheets of calcite, and the heavy varieties are\r\ndue to later deposits of calcite and aragonite crystals or, pop corn.\r\n\r\nThe colors are white, yellow, blue and chocolate brown; the last named\r\npredominating to a great extent in that portion of the cave most easily\r\ntraveled by visitors, and forming the ceiling and a part of one wall in\r\nthe Post Office, where, as has been said before, it first appears. The\r\neffect is not dreary as might be imagined, and parties are generally\r\nphotographed here because one side of the room is white and greatly\r\nassists the flash. This is a smooth, perpendicular wall marking the line\r\nof the fissure and showing the strata of the rock in horizontal position\r\nwhitened with a thin coating of carbonate of lime. All visitors are\r\ncordially invited to please themselves in leaving cards, letters or\r\npapers in this chamber, which is reserved for that purpose, and to\r\nrefrain from leaving them in other portions of the cave or defacing the\r\nwalls with names.\r\n\r\nRoe's Misery is a long, narrow passage into which, during the early\r\ntimes before its size had been increased by blasting, a large man named\r\nRoe crawled to his sorrow. Being larger than the hole he stuck fast, and\r\nneither his own efforts nor those of the guides could relieve the\r\nsituation until a rope was sent for, and having been brought, was\r\nsecurely fastened to his feet, when a long pull and a strong one finally\r\nopened the passage. It is told that he claimed to have reviewed all the\r\nobjectionable acts of his life, by which his friends understood that he\r\noccupied the motionless position not less than three weeks.\r\n\r\nRed Hall is very nearly described by its name and is quite a showy room,\r\nwith the bright red walls contrasting sharply with their limited\r\nornamentation of pure white carbonate of lime and pearly crystals of\r\ncalcite.\r\n\r\nOff to one side of Red Hall is a beautiful little chamber called Old\r\nMaids' Grotto, probably on account of its trim appearance and ideal\r\nlocation. It is so entirely concealed from the view of those passing on\r\nthe public highway, that its existence is not even suspected, until\r\nspecial attention is called to its cosiness, and then it is necessary to\r\nmount an accumulation of great water-rounded rocks in order to obtain\r\nconvincing evidence of its actual reality. It is a long, narrow room,\r\nshut in by a straight wall sufficiently high for rigid seclusion, or\r\nprotection, without preventing a glimpse of passing events.\r\n\r\nA break in the description is made here for the purpose of inserting a\r\ndescription, written at the author's request, by Mr. E.L. McDonald. He\r\nwas generally our special guide. He has chosen to describe the route\r\ntaken by the majority of visitors and therefore the balance of my\r\nobservations within those limits are omitted.\r\n\r\nAll who are familiar with those passages and chambers will observe while\r\nreading the next chapter that no imaginary attractions are added to the\r\nexisting facts, but many interesting minor points are missing.\r\n\r\nOnly such changes are made as were agreed to as the condition on which\r\nhe would attempt a piece of work so at variance with his usual\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] U.S. Geological Survey. Geology of the Black Hills. Henry Newton, p.\r\n138.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWIND CAVE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FAIR GROUNDS ROUTE.\r\n\r\n\"At 9:30 in the morning the train bringing health-seekers and tourists\r\narrives at Hot Springs, a beautiful little city nestled in the\r\nsouthernmost foot-hills of the world-reputed Black Hills of South\r\nDakota. The choice of a hotel is soon made, and when located, the\r\nnew-comers observe the other guests and acquaint themselves with the\r\nattractions of the resort. Probably during the day they are approached\r\nby the solicitor of the wonderful Wind Cave, who explains that the best\r\nway to reach the cave is by means of the coach and four seen at the\r\nhotel in the morning, and arrangements are made for the following day.\r\nThe next morning, seated in the tally-ho coach with strangers who are\r\nsoon acquaintances, you start on a beautiful twelve-mile drive to one of\r\nnature's most interesting sights.\r\n\r\n\"Immediately after leaving town you begin to admire the scenery and\r\nenjoy the cool, refreshing breezes, wafted from the mountains to the\r\nnorth, down the slopes to the arid plains.\r\n\r\n\"After climbing a gently sloping 'hog-back' for about eight miles, you\r\nare at the top of the divide and one thousand feet higher than Hot\r\nSprings, which may be seen on the left. Looking ahead you can see Harney\r\nPeak, the highest mountain in the Black Hills district; and on the right\r\nyou see Buffalo Gap, through which the creek runs that heads at\r\nMin-ne-pa-juta Springs. The Indians used to drive buffalo through this\r\ngap, hence its name. A small but thriving little town to the eastward\r\ntakes its name from this Buffalo Gap. From here you begin to go down a\r\ngentle and winding incline to the cave, which is reached all too soon.\r\n\r\n\"At the office you register and procure tickets, and then have from\r\none-half to three-quarters of an hour in which to eat lunch or dine at\r\nthe hotel. Then all congregate in the office, from whence the start is\r\nmade, after every one has put on a cave cap, _not a suit, as such is\r\nentirely unnecessary_. The guide leads the way to the entrance of the\r\ncave which is separated from the office by some little distance, and is\r\nlocated in the bed of a long since dry run, which in former times has\r\nbared the carboniferous strata, and within this kind of rock the cave is\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n\"As the author has asked me for an article descriptive of the cave, I\r\nwill only attempt to say something of our medium length route to the\r\nFair Grounds, or in other words, the Fair Grounds' Route. A collective\r\ndescription of the whole cave would take months--even years--to\r\ncomplete. Besides, the above route is the one most used by visitors at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\n\"On entering the Cave House (a log structure) you will in all\r\nprobability ask from whence comes the murmur of a waterfall. The guide\r\nanswers that it is the rushing current of air at the mouth of the cave,\r\nsometimes in and sometimes out. Prof. J.E. Todd, in bulletin No. 1, S.\r\nDakota Geological Survey, p. 48, says: 'This phenomenon is found to\r\ncorrespond with the varying pressure of the barometer, and with its\r\nsingle opening and capacious chambers is easily accounted for.'\r\n\r\n\"The rushing air is sometimes strong enough to require a man's weight to\r\nopen the entrance door. Five days and nights is the longest time the\r\nwind has been known to move in one direction without ceasing. This is\r\none of nature's greatest atmospherical phenomena.\r\n\r\n\"Some one says, 'Tickets, please!' and into the hole we go, single file\r\ndown a lighted passageway to where we can light our candles. After\r\ndescending about one hundred and fifty-five feet we come into the Bridal\r\nChamber (named by some of the earlier explorers before the present\r\nmanagement took hold of the property), which is eight or ten feet in\r\nlength by twenty feet in breadth. Passing along some distance, the\r\nSnow-ball Room is entered. It carries this name on account of little\r\nrosettes of carbonate of lime sticking to the irregular ceiling. This\r\nroom is pretty narrow and some fifty feet in length.\r\n\r\n\"The Post Office is next and soon reached. The ceiling is covered with\r\nthe box work formation somewhat resembling Post Office boxes. You will\r\nno doubt wonder why it carries such a common name.\r\n\r\n\"Just because after searching in what books on geology and other\r\nsciences we could get, we could not find it described nor any formation\r\nresembling it; hence its common name, as we have named the pop-corn\r\nwork, frost work etc., from their appearance.\r\n\r\n\"The dimensions of the Post Office are some eighty feet in length by\r\ntwenty feet in width, with an average ceiling height of probably twelve\r\nfeet. Red Hall is the room next in order, and has on either side a red\r\nbank of sandy, micaceous clay.\r\n\r\n\"Just to the left is a very pretty little grotto of box work. This room\r\nis very odd in make-up. The floor is very rough and dips about fifteen\r\nfeet in its length of sixty feet, and includes a short flight of stairs.\r\nThe lowest end of the room is prettily decorated, and some pleasing\r\nblends of color attract the eye. To the left is the Old Maids' Grotto, a\r\npretty little nook that would please any maid old or young.\r\n\r\n\"After passing through the White Room we turn to the left along the\r\ncrevice, and after traveling some little distance reach The Grand Opera,\r\na very narrow room but some forty feet in length. Chopin's Nocturne is a\r\nsmall grotto in the right hand wall named by the famous violinist,\r\nEdouard Remenji.\r\n\r\n\"The Devil's Lookout is reached by a few steps. It is a crevice about\r\nten feet wide at the base and sixty-five feet in height. This place is\r\nremarkable for its columns of rock just over head. The pathway leads to\r\nMilton's Study, some fifty feet distant. Turning into the crevice again,\r\nsome twenty feet are traveled when attention is called to Seal Rocks.\r\nSampson's Palace is the next room in order: here we see some stalagmitic\r\nwater formation on the left wall and the ceiling is one of the most\r\nbeautiful yet seen on the trip.\r\n\r\n\"We pass along to Swiss Scenery, a very prettily decorated room fifty\r\nfeet in length by fifteen in height. The box work is very pretty,\r\nshading from yellow to dark brown. The general appearance of the room\r\nwould suggest its name, it being rougher than any other in the immediate\r\nvicinity. Passing under an arch we enter the Queen's Drawing-room. Here\r\nthe box work has been developed beyond any on our pathway thus far. From\r\nthe ceiling it hangs like draperies and on the left wall is about\r\ntwenty-four inches in depth. On the whole this room is elegant enough\r\nfor the most exacting queen. We step from this room into the M.E.\r\nChurch. Rev. Mr. Hancher, President of the Black Hills Methodist\r\nCollege, was I believe the first to hold song and prayer service in this\r\nroom; the pulpit is on the left as you pass through. The guides always\r\nask if any wish to sing or worship, as any one has a perfect right in a\r\ndedicated Chapel.\r\n\r\n\"The Giant's Causeway is only a few steps beyond. This bit of scenery\r\nhas some resemblance to the famed basalt attraction on the coast of\r\nIreland. We 'duck' our heads under the Arch of Politeness and rise to a\r\nstanding position in Lena's Arbor, a very irregular shaped room admired\r\nby a great many of our visitors.\r\n\r\n\"We enter Capitol Hall at the side, about midway between the ends. It is\r\nthe largest room yet visited, being some two hundred feet from end to\r\nend, with a very high ceiling. Here we notice the walls and ceiling are\r\nbare of box work and other formation, and are clean and white. The\r\ndecorative appearance exceeds any room yet visited. After getting into\r\nline again we go down a flight of stairs to Odd Fellows' Hall, a chamber\r\nthat on examination suggests its name. In the ceiling is situated the\r\n'All seeing eye,' one of the emblems of that august body, and at a\r\nlittle distance the 'Three links;' also in the ceiling, and just under\r\nthe latter is situated a rock very much resembling a goat. Attention is\r\ncalled to the first appearance of pop-corn work, a very peculiar\r\nformation resembling pop-corn after it has broken open, and in this part\r\nof the cave it is quite plentiful.\r\n\r\n\"We now descend another flight of stairs into Turtle Pass, where a large\r\nturtle rests beside the path, and just beyond is the Confederate\r\nCross-roads, where the fissure is crossed by another forming a cross\r\nwith perfect right angles. The right hand passage is used for specimens\r\nonly; straight ahead leads to the Garden of Eden, the end of our\r\nshortest route; we take the left hand path and journey through Summer\r\nAvenue, some seventy feet in length, and reach the Scenes of Wiclow, a\r\nlarge and high room, beautifully decorated with box work and pop-corn.\r\nThe ceiling and the left wall from floor to ceiling are fine box work.\r\nOn the right you see dark space, as a very large portion of this room is\r\nunused, but we pass the Piper's Pig. List! The guide is pounding on the\r\nSalvation Army Drum, a large projecting rock that on being struck with\r\nthe closed hand gives a sound very much like a bass drum.\r\n\r\n\"After walking across a short plank we enter Kimball's Music Hall, a\r\nvery beautiful room settled between two crevices and lined with box\r\nwork. Viewing the ceiling from the fissure on the right it is seen to\r\nbe smooth and fringed with pop-corn. In some places the boxes are\r\nclosed, resembling finished honey-comb. Over head box work can be seen\r\nas high as the light penetrates. On the whole, I think this is the\r\nfinest crevice in the explored cave.\r\n\r\n\"Looking straight ahead you wonder how the party can travel over such a\r\nroad as presents itself to view, but the guide turns into an arch in the\r\nright hand wall and enters Whitney Avenue. After walking across the\r\nbridge over shadowy depths, our pathway lies for some fifty feet in one\r\nof the most interesting ovens in the cave, at the end of which we enter\r\nMonte Cristo's Palace by going down a flight of stairs. This room has\r\nthe greatest depth beneath the surface of any of the Fair Grounds'\r\nRoute, which is four hundred and fifty feet. In this room is noticed a\r\ndecided change in the box work, which is much heavier than any seen, or\r\nthat will be seen on this route, and the color is light blue.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I will give the party a talk while we rest under Monte Cristo's\r\nDiamonds, a very sparkling cluster, about six inches in diameter, of\r\nsilica crystals.\r\n\r\n\"After studying the cave, it appears that it did not form in the same\r\nmanner as most others; on account of the absence of sink holes, the\r\nregular arrangement of the chambers, the regular dip of the rock to the\r\nsouth-east from five to ten degrees, and the regularity of the long\r\nvertical fissures running north-west south-east. In fact, the whole cave\r\nis made up of these fissures and it seems that the water has entered\r\nnarrow crevices opened by some eruptive force.\r\n\r\n\"You see small holes eaten in the ceilings and walls in every direction,\r\nwhich indicates that the water came from a higher level, and being under\r\ngreat pressure, wanted passage out. It seems the cave was a reservoir\r\nfor a long time, then after the water stopped flowing in it slowly\r\nreceded, and in settling the overcharged waters covered the rocks and\r\nspecimens with a calcareous coating, very thin in the upper portions of\r\nthe cave and getting thicker the deeper you go, giving evidence as you\r\nsee, of slowly settling. Had the waters rushed out they would in all\r\nprobability have left the rocks uncoated as in all other caves, with one\r\nexception, the Crystal Cave, some seventy-five miles to the north of\r\nWind Cave.\r\n\r\n\"As we have some more caves to see we must journey on.\r\n\r\n\"Taking one last look at Monte Cristo's Diamonds we pass into Milliner's\r\nAvenue, a very pretty avenue indeed with nearly as many colors as a\r\nmilliner's show-window would present. About mid-way of this avenue we\r\ncross the bridge over Castle Garden, a room in the eighth tier beneath\r\nthe surface. From this avenue we step into the Assembly Room. Here the\r\nformations are covered with a gypsum crystal that sparkles with\r\nwonderful brilliancy. On the right is a passage leading to the Masonic\r\nTemple, a room that any body of Masons would be proud of could they hold\r\nlodge meetings in it. The passage on the left is the terminus of the\r\nPearly Gates' Route, the longest developed route in the cave. After\r\nmoving along some distance we see the Bad Lands, and then come into the\r\nTennis Court. This room has the net in the ceiling and I suppose the\r\nparty can furnish the raquet (racket). On the right hand side of this\r\nroom there is tier upon tier of box work; looking to the left, you\r\nshudder at the almost bottomless pit just beside the pathway. Here we\r\ntake a rest preparatory to climbing up to the Marble Quarry, a task of\r\ntwo flights of stairs. This is a very large room and has the most uneven\r\nfloor, ceiling and walls of any that our visitors see, and is barren of\r\nspecimens excepting in the first part over the stairs where there is\r\nsome box work of very pretty structure and color. Some distance up the\r\npath we see on one side the Ghost of 'She,' and on the other the Devil's\r\nPunch Bowl, a large rock with a basin-shaped hole about thirty-six\r\ninches across and sixteen inches deep, but lo! the bottom has been\r\nbroken out: which is very appropriate as South Dakota is at present a\r\nprohibition state. A winding path is followed until attention is called\r\nto the Sheep's Head above an arch over the passage, and the ceiling here\r\nis of flint, the ledge of which is four inches thick.\r\n\r\n\"Passing under the arch we enter Johnstone's Camp Ground, so named\r\nbecause Paul Alexander Johnstone camped in this room while accomplishing\r\nthe third of his greatest mind-reading feats, during which he remained\r\nin the cave seventy-two hours. He was locked in his room at the Evans\r\nHotel while a committee secreted the head of a gold pin in the cave. On\r\ntheir return, after being blindfolded, he led them to the livery stable,\r\nand securing a team drove to the cave and found the pin in the Standing\r\nRock Chamber, beyond the Pearly Gates, and then drove back to the city\r\nstill blindfolded.\r\n\r\n\"Down one short flight of stairs and we are in the Waiting Room, so\r\ncalled on account of persons waiting here while the rest of their party\r\nfinished the trip by climbing up the Alpine Way. This difficult climb\r\nwas made until the route was developed via the Marble Quarry. A steep\r\npathway and one flight of stairs now bring us to the Ticket Office, and\r\nanother short stairway leads into the room above, which is the Fair\r\nGrounds. We enter the right wing, which measures two hundred and six\r\nlinks in length and forty-nine in width at the narrowest place. We are\r\nnow in the third level and no box work is seen, but the ceiling (which\r\nis low) shows many interesting fossils. The central dome is some fifty\r\nfeet in height, and passing to the right the guide seats the party in\r\nsuch a position that the frost work on the wall can be seen to\r\nadvantage. This is the largest part of the Fair Grounds and measures six\r\nhundred and forty-five links long, exclusive of the right wing, and has\r\na width of fifty-three links, which with a number of wings added, makes\r\nit one of the largest under-ground rooms within American caverns.\r\n\r\n\"A great many visitors look at their cuff-buttons when told we have\r\ntwenty-five hundred rooms included in ninety-seven miles of passageways.\r\nOf course they do not understand how we get the mileage. In going to the\r\nFair Grounds we travel about three miles. In each fissure there are\r\neight levels, which makes twenty-four miles of cave from the entrance to\r\nthe Fair Grounds.\r\n\r\n\"Of the formations in the cave, the different kinds are on different\r\nlevels, the stalactites and stalagmites nearest the surface on the\r\nsecond, the frost work on the third. This formation is in most instances\r\nas colorless as snow. The mode of its formation is not thoroughly\r\nunderstood, but is found in such positions as suggest its being formed\r\nby vapors overcharged as spoken of about the water. It is almost always\r\non an over-hanging rock, over or near some fissure leading to a deeper\r\nportion of the cave. Box work in this level is scattering and fragile:\r\nin the fourth it is the prevailing formation: in the fifth it is heavier\r\nand a little darker; in the sixth it varies in style and color, and\r\npop-corn appears, a queer formation resembling pop-corn ready to eat. It\r\nis not so purely white here as in the lower levels, seventh and eighth.\r\nIn the seventh the box work is heavier than any seen on the Fair\r\nGrounds' Route and the color is nearly blue, having a faded appearance.\r\nIn this tier is also found a good deal of mineral wool, which must not\r\nbe mistaken for asbestos. It sometimes attains a length of eighteen\r\ninches and at one place where it seems to come out of a hole two inches\r\nin diameter, and drops down like a grey beard, we have named it Noah's\r\nBeard.\r\n\r\n\"In the eighth tier we find very beautiful formations of carbonate of\r\nlime, and the box work is decidedly blue, the boxes larger, and their\r\npartitions one half inch thick.\r\n\r\n\"We have been deeper than the eighth tier but in narrow crevices barely\r\nadmitting a man of average stature. In these the calcareous coating is\r\nmuch thicker than in any higher portions of the cave, but very little\r\nsign of box work is seen.\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes we make a comparison between the cave and a sponge. Take for\r\ninstance a sponge as large as an apple barrel and there would be holes\r\nin it as big as a man's thumb and closed hand. Now take a sponge, four\r\nmiles square and five hundred feet deep with holes in proportion to the\r\nlittle sponge, and you have an illustration of The Wonderful Wind Cave,\r\nof Custer County, South Dakota.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nWIND CAVE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEARLY GATES AND BLUE GROTTO ROUTE.\r\n\r\nA very much longer, more beautiful, and also more difficult journey than\r\nthe one just described may be taken by those in whom the desire to see\r\nis greater than the fear of fatigue, or possibly, some little danger.\r\nWith this object in view the Fair Grounds' Route is followed through\r\nMonte Cristo's Palace and into Milliner's Avenue. Here we leave it by\r\ndropping off the bridge into a rough hole, which proves to be a passage\r\ndescending into Castle Garden directly beneath the Avenue, and a room of\r\nconsiderable size, plentifully supplied with bowlders. Although\r\ninteresting to visit, it has no points of such special merit as would\r\nseem to require a detailed account, the main importance attaching to it\r\nbeing the fact that it is the first portion of the eighth level visited.\r\nA little beyond, however, is something quite new. The floor is covered\r\nwith a light yellow crust of calcite crystal, sufficiently strong to\r\nbear the weight of a limited number of guests without much fracture. It\r\ngenerally gives a hollow sound when struck, which is easily accounted\r\nfor as there are small holes noticed by which steam evidently made its\r\nescape, and through these cavities can be seen but they are shallow. One\r\nplace shows the crust broken up and with the edges of the pieces\r\noverlapped, like ice broken by a sudden rise of back-water, and in this\r\nposition they have been firmly cemented.\r\n\r\nThis is where the slowly receding waters of the cave lingered in shallow\r\npools above the small crevices long after the main portions had become\r\ndry. That the crust was formed on top of the water, instead of beneath\r\nits surface, has been proved by the only body of water now standing in\r\nthe cave. This is called Silent Lake, and being situated on another\r\nroute will be described in its proper place, but when discovered no\r\nwater was visible nor its presence even suspected until the crust gave\r\nway under the weight of an explorer. The thin sheet of yellow calcite\r\ncrystal thus broken was the same as that seen in great abundance in the\r\nnow perfectly dry eighth level. The gradually decreasing volume of water\r\nhas left a smooth yellow coat on portions of the walls where\r\nirregularities or slopes were favorable, and at least one such place is\r\nvividly remembered if once seen. A steep incline of about fifteen feet\r\nleads to a small oval hole through the wall; towards this we crawled\r\nwith no great ease; but getting to the hole was far easier than going\r\nthrough it into a tiny cubby not high enough to sit comfortably upright\r\nin, and too small to permit an average sized human being to turn around.\r\nClose on the left it is shut in by another wall pierced by two holes\r\nsimilar to that just passed, and each revealing a miniature chamber\r\nscarcely more than three feet in either direction and eighteen inches\r\nhigh. Being directed to examine the ceiling of the first, it was done\r\nwith some difficulty and much satisfaction, for there in the center was\r\na most exquisite bit of art work, a circular disk of \"drusy\" quartz\r\nabout twelve inches in diameter and having the appearance of a flat\r\nrosette of fine black lace, in open pattern with small diamonds thickly\r\nstrung on every thread; a brilliant, sparkling mass of gems. After Mr.\r\nMcDonald had carefully removed a geode from the other little chamber, he\r\nslid down into a fourth, the last of the diminutive suite, having\r\nsufficient height to allow a sitting posture with raised head, and\r\nopened the small jewel case, while I examined the place it came from.\r\nHere all was calcite crystal heavily massed in various forms, and a\r\nharmony of blue and brown, with half a dozen round, unbroken, perfect\r\ngeodes hanging from the ceiling like oriole nests. The geode taken\r\nproved on opening to be especially fine, being filled with pearly white\r\ncalcite crystals of both the dog-tooth and nail-head forms, and was\r\nkindly presented to be added to the collection of cave specimens already\r\npurchased in town, to which were also added handsome pieces of \"drusy\"\r\nquartz, cave coral, and tufa and mineral wool.\r\n\r\nFollowing the guide I now slipped down into the larger nook just\r\nvacated, and saw with considerable chagrin that the next step was down a\r\nperpendicular wall more than ten feet in height, facing a high, narrow\r\nfissure, the floor of which was merely two shelves sloping to an open\r\nspace along the middle, almost two feet wide, with the darkness of\r\ncontinuing crevice below. Further progress seemed absolutely impossible.\r\nAll things are, however, possible to those who will, and it had been\r\nwilled to pay a visit to the grandest portion of Wind Cave. In order to\r\ndo so the descent must be made and was. Then some little distance must\r\nbe traveled along the crevice, but the angle of elevation taken by both\r\nsides of the bisected floor served as a sort of prohibitory tax together\r\nwith the calcite paving, since to maintain an upright position on such a\r\nsurface would require long training of a certain professional character.\r\nThat difficulty, too, was overcome by placing a foot on either side of\r\nthe open crevice; the first consideration, of course, being safety and\r\nnot grace.\r\n\r\nWe now came to the enjoyment of the reward of merit. Flooded with the\r\nbrilliant white light of magnesium ribbon, the crevice walls could be\r\nseen drawing together at a height of sixty-five feet, and both composed\r\nentirely of larger box work than any seen before and very heavily\r\ncovered with calcite crystal, colored a bright electric blue and glowing\r\nwith a pearly lustre. This is the Centennial Gallery, and leaving it\r\nwith reluctance we passed on into the Blue Grotto to find it finer\r\nstill. It is somewhat wider and higher, while even the extremely rough,\r\nuneven floor shows no spot bare of heavy box work of a yet deeper blue.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful beauty of this Blue Grotto necessarily stands beyond\r\ncomparison because in all the known world there is nothing like it. The\r\nforms of crystal are chiefly aragonite.\r\n\r\nFrom here we pass to the \"Chamber de Norcutt,\" which would be considered\r\na very handsome room if it had no superiors: and the same can be said of\r\nUnion College, in which, however, is the Fan Rock to claim special\r\nnotice; an immense piece of fallen box work shaped like a lady's fan\r\nhalf opened.\r\n\r\nAn imposing vestibule leads into the extensive but rather dreary\r\nCatacombs, from which we crawled through a little hole into the M.W.A.\r\nHall, emerging at the top of a steep but not high slope covered with the\r\nsmooth yellow crust of calcite encountered at other places, and in\r\ntrying to make a dexterous turn so as to go down feet first, the\r\ndescent was accomplished with uncalculated suddenness and an unsought\r\nbut liberal collection of bruises. This, however, was not a happening of\r\nthe unexpected and could have no attention amid scenes of wonder and\r\nbeauty, and we were close to the Geysers. From a scientific point of\r\nview this is the most important portion of the cave, for here is an\r\nindisputable proof that the water in the cave was hot and that it was\r\nsubject to geyser action. The surrounding region is covered with the\r\ncrust already described, and at the top of a gentle elevation is thrown\r\nup in the unmistakable form of geyser cones; there being two near\r\ntogether on the surface described, with a third visible through one of\r\nthese on a slightly lower level, this one being a new discovery, as it\r\nhad escaped observation until we called attention to it.\r\n\r\nThese small cones show that after the degree of heat and the volume of\r\nwater had become reduced to the merest fraction of their former\r\ngreatness, they continued their accustomed work here in the depth of the\r\nearth long after the once grand old geyser had ceased to show an outward\r\nsign of life. When the water finally became so reduced even here that\r\nthe steam could no longer force it through, or to these latest vents,\r\nthe last rising vapors fringed their edges with a beautiful snow-white\r\nborder of crystallized carbonate of lime as fine and soft as a band of\r\nswan's down, which it resembles. In the pure, still atmosphere of the\r\neighth level, almost five hundred feet beneath the entrance, this silent\r\nproof of ancient action will endure for the admiration and instruction\r\nof many generations yet to come. Few mortals will ever be honored with\r\nmemorials so lasting or so convincing of vanished power.\r\n\r\nProceeding on the journey the next chamber is the A.O.U.W. Hall, a\r\nlarge, irregular room, by the rise of which a return to the seventh\r\nlevel is accomplished; and the next entered is the Tabernacle, not at\r\nall resembling the last, although a similar description would be\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nNow is reached what many consider the cave's greatest charm, The Pearly\r\nGates. And marvelously beautiful it certainly is.\r\n\r\nApproaching by a slightly lower level, we see a gateway opening between\r\nlarge rocks that light up with the soft lustre and varied tints of\r\nmammoth pearls. A wonderful effect is produced by the white calcite\r\ncrystal spread in unequal thickness over the dark surface of the\r\nencrusted rocks. Just without the gate is a short but not golden\r\nstairway leading to it, and immediately within is the Saint's Rest, a\r\nchamber of moderate size beautified by another great rock on which are\r\ncombined the warm, pearly glow of calcite and the cold glitter of frost\r\nby the later addition of lime carbonate vapor-crystals to the calcium\r\ncarbonate aragonite.\r\n\r\nNext beyond is the chamber containing the Standing Rock behind which Mr.\r\nJohnstone made his famous discovery of the concealed pin-head. It is an\r\nimmense great fallen rock on whose dark surface are scattered\r\ntransparent flake-like crystals of satin spar, resembling the congealed\r\ndrops of a summer shower. The mind-reader entered the chamber by the way\r\nwe shall leave it.\r\n\r\nReturning to the spot from which the Pearly Gates were first viewed, we\r\nstand facing the most beautiful of this imposing group of brilliant\r\nscenes, The Mermaid's Resort. This is a small cove with wave marks in\r\nthe white beach sand, above which rises a projecting, sheltering cliff\r\nas purely white as freshly fallen snow, with a fine deposit of frost\r\nwork in thick moss-like patterns two and three inches deep.\r\n\r\nThis crystalline mass, so white and fragile, has to perfection the\r\nappearance of hoar-frost about a steam-vent in extremely cold weather,\r\nand was, no doubt, formed in a somewhat similar manner. It is\r\ncrystallized carbonate of lime, and could have been deposited in such\r\nextremely delicate forms only by the heavily charged vapors rising from\r\nhot water. No one needs to be told that hot water will take and hold in\r\nsolution a much larger quantity of solid matter than is possible to cold\r\nwater, with all other conditions the same; nor is it news that a portion\r\nof the solid substance is carried off in the rising steam. Now the\r\ngeyser cones, so recently visited on the next lower level, prove both\r\nthe heat of the water and its heavy charge of solids, which gave it a\r\nfar more intense heat than pure water could have equaled, and this in\r\nturn drove the steam to greater distances than otherwise it would have\r\nreached. When cooled to such a point as to be reduced to a light vapor,\r\nits movement was checked by various walls, projections, and ceiling as\r\nwere in its upward path, and these received the minute particles of\r\nburden, while the somewhat brisk motion of the atmosphere, occasioned at\r\nthese points by the mixing of that of higher temperature from below with\r\nthe lower from above, is responsible for the dainty and varied forms\r\nassumed by the fragile structure.\r\n\r\nOnce more resuming the journey, we admire the rugged charms of\r\nUniversity Heights, a somewhat larger and higher room than the next, St.\r\nDominic's Chamber, but perhaps not more interesting than the Council\r\nChamber, which besides other attractions is to some extent also a\r\nStatuary Hall. From the Council Chamber the Alpine Way leads up into the\r\nFair Grounds directly above. This Alpine Way is a sort of cork-screw\r\ntwisting through the rocks, not unlike a badly walled well, assisted at\r\nthe lowest portion by a short and nearly perpendicular ladder. Next is\r\nthe Assembly Room, or Crown Chamber, as it is also called on account of\r\na handsome crown conspicuously placed. This room also contains a Moose\r\nso perfectly carved that the skeptic who searches diligently for\r\nimperfections finally clamors for the whole company to celebrate his\r\ndiscovery of the artist's noble skill.\r\n\r\nLeaving this room we re-enter Milliner's Avenue and soon cross the\r\nbridge from which, a few hours ago, we descended into the eighth level\r\nby way of Castle Garden; and now the return to the surface is by the\r\nroute followed before, and we arrive there at last terribly weary, but\r\nmore than well pleased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nWIND CAVE CONCLUDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARDEN OF EDEN, THE GLACIER, AND ICE PALACE.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another long and charming line of travel open to those who\r\nhave sufficiently steady heads and light feet to suffer no loss of\r\nconfidence or depression of spirit when mounting the steep stairway\r\nwhose limit seems lost in the dark distance above.\r\n\r\nThere being but the single entrance, a repetition of the worn and\r\nancient statement that all roads lead to Rome, means that many journeys\r\nmay be taken in Wind Cave, but all must have the same beginning.\r\n\r\nIn the tourist season the guides have not time during the day to bring\r\nout specimens to supply the demand, so on this account night trips are\r\nof frequent occurrence; and on these occasions the number of persons in\r\nall that vast space seldom exceeds half a dozen, but their voices and\r\nlaughter, and the blows of their hammers, can be heard at greater\r\ndistances than would seem possible, and give an agreeable sense of\r\ncompanionship; yet the voice does not travel by any means so far as in\r\nother caves.\r\n\r\nThe evening we were to make the long trip just mentioned, our guide\r\nbeing ready before any others had gone in, we started the advance on the\r\nninety-seven miles of enclosed, unoccupied space and had almost reached\r\nthe level of the Bridal Chamber when he remembered a forgotten and\r\nnecessary roll of magnesium ribbon, for which it was needful to return\r\nto the office in the upper building. I sat down on the lowest step of\r\nthe great stairway to wait, and for a very short time was entirely alone\r\nin the largest cavern in the world, excepting the Mammoth Cave of\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nThe unexpected experience seemed suddenly to become one of the great\r\nevents of a lifetime, and was unmarred by the disturbing apprehensions\r\nof any possible danger. The entire absence of sound was indescribably\r\nawe-inspiring as\r\n\r\n    \"Strata overleaping strata from the center to the crust,\r\n    Rose, Alp-high, in molten silence, as the dead rise from the dust;\"\r\n\r\nbut the feeling of complete isolation from the living world would not\r\nrequire an unlimited time to merit the one word--horrible. Even some\r\nperil with ample companionship would be more agreeable, while it is a\r\ncurious fact that the combination of companionship with silence is\r\ncharming. On the occasion of one visit to the cave it was painful to\r\nobserve the actual suffering of a lover of quiet, from the\r\ngood-natured, but heedless, chatter of two of the party.\r\n\r\nPresently steps on the stairs broke the stillness, a glimmer of light\r\npierced the intense darkness that surrounded the circle of one candle,\r\nand the upper world seemed not so far away.\r\n\r\nThe interrupted journey was resumed, the route being that already\r\ndescribed as far as the Confederate Cross Roads, where, this time, we go\r\nstraight on in the main fissure instead of turning into the\r\ncross-crevice, as was done before.\r\n\r\nWe were overtaken by the specimen party and recognized the three\r\nlaughing young girls only by their voices, as in full suits of overalls\r\nand white duck caps, they looked like boys. Those who reside near the\r\nlarge caves have overcome their objection to this costume, as it gives\r\nmuch greater freedom and ease of movement, besides being a decided\r\neconomy. Feminine garments are so easily destroyed, but for artistic\r\neffect the substitute cannot conscientiously be recommended.\r\n\r\nBeyond the Cross Roads the first chamber is Breckinridge Gallery, a\r\nlong, rambling hall in which are combined the attractions already passed\r\nand those yet to come, but having no striking feature predominating to\r\ngive special character other than the grandeur of extreme roughness,\r\nwhich is also the quality most observed on passing into the Stone\r\nQuarry, where great accumulations of blocks seem waiting preparation for\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\nThe next \"open country\" is protected from public trespass by the Garden\r\nWall, which appears to have been well built in the long ago by masons\r\nproperly trained in their craft, and extends, at a uniform height, to\r\nthe Fallen Flats, where the floor is covered with slabs of enormous size\r\nthat have fallen from the ceiling since water occupation ceased, as is\r\nclearly shown by the sharp edges and surfaces entirely unworn.\r\n\r\nThe journey now becomes more interesting as the Cliff-Climbers' Delight\r\nis reached, and we go steadily up the long nights of stairs until\r\nvisions of St. Peter begin to rise and we wonder which way the key will\r\nturn. Near the top is a handsome growth of snow-white mold hanging in\r\nlong draperies behind the ladder or spread like on asparagus fern\r\nflattened against the rock.\r\n\r\nArrived at the top limits of the stairs the ascent is by no means\r\nfinished, but continues through three large chambers known as Five\r\nPoints, the Omaha Bee Office--named by one of the staff of that well\r\nknown journal--and the W.C.T.U. Hall, dedicated to the service of the\r\norganization by one of its workers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Top of Glacier. Page 155.]\r\n\r\nAt last the upward journey is ended at the Silent Lake in the first, or\r\nhighest, level. This, as has already been observed, is the only body of\r\nwater now standing in the cave, and is not more than ten feet long by\r\nsix in width and twelve inches deep. The scanty volume is maintained by\r\nthe very limited inflow of acidulated percolating water which reaches\r\nthe small receiving basin charged with calcium carbonate; and being\r\ncold, the charge is being precipitated on the bottom instead of forming\r\na crust over the surface as in former times when the controlling\r\ninfluence was a degree of heat sufficient to sustain solid matter\r\nwithout disturbing motion.\r\n\r\nRising above the Silent Lake is the Glacier, its moist surface\r\nsuggesting that the lake is fed by a slight thaw, while the\r\nperpendicular front at the water's edge gives the impression of a berg\r\nhaving recently broken off and floated away.\r\n\r\nThe Glacier flows between two high walls of dark rock, and the steep\r\nincline of perhaps seventy feet, covered with a smooth deposit of\r\ncalcite and shining with moisture, has the appearance of ice and is as\r\nuninviting for a climb. The top is connected with the roof above by a\r\ngroup of short, and for this region, heavy columns of dripstone, the\r\noldest formation of that character in the cave.\r\n\r\nAn occasional overflow of the lake passes out to one side, then turns\r\nand goes under the Glacier where its first few feet of descent are\r\ncalled the Pearl Beds, where a variety of water-polished pebbles are\r\nbeing coated over and cemented together with calcite crystal.\r\n\r\nFrom the Glacier down to the lowest level of the cave by another route\r\nthan that taken for the ascent, there is abundant evidence that at one\r\ntime this portion of the cave was subject to excessively violent\r\nactivity, and if studied with a view to the penetration of the principle\r\nof geyser action, offers many interesting and valuable suggestions that\r\ncan be added to and expanded into definite theories in connection with\r\nthe balance of the cave; all important requirements are clearly shown.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the Glacier is a small circular dome, called\r\nthe Picture Gallery, which evidently was shaped by water forced up from\r\nbelow. The descent from here takes us into the St. Louis Tunnel, a long\r\nrough passage leading down into the great Cathedral, by the still\r\ndescending irregularities of which we finally reach the Garden of Eden,\r\nthe objective point of a favorite tourist route, but usually approached\r\nfrom the opposite direction. It is a large chamber of very irregular\r\nshape, with an extremely uneven ceiling, dipping nearly to the floor and\r\nrising suddenly to distant heights, while every portion of all the\r\nvaried surfaces glitters with a mass of frost work in every form it is\r\nknown to have assumed; the banks of orange buds in different stages of\r\nexpansion being exceptionally handsome. A portion of this wonderful room\r\nespecially admired is Cupid's Alcove, where the frost is tinged with a\r\npinkish flush from the brilliant paint clay captured in minute particles\r\nby the vapors. The whole room is a marvel of loveliness, but\r\nunfortunately visitors have wrought such noticeable damage that wire\r\nscreening must be placed before the general admittance of large parties\r\ncan be resumed.\r\n\r\nPassing out and down to a lower level, by way of Jacob's Well, we find\r\nthe source of that magnificent abundance of frost work to be in the\r\nChamber of Forbidden Fruit, where a yellow calcite floor-crust indicates\r\nthe surface level of water diminishing in volume by evaporation long\r\nafter the upward flow had forever ceased, and from which the rising\r\nvapor ascended to decorate the Garden of Eden, just described. But since\r\nthis water completely disappeared, leaving in evidence only the\r\nrecord-bearing crust, a percolating drip has prepared indisputable proof\r\nof the remote distance of that time by depositing on the crust great\r\nclusters of luscious fruits, chiefly cherries, which appear to have been\r\ncarelessly tossed down in heaps, but are firmly fixed in place.\r\n\r\nThe onward journey continues up and down through Beacon Heights, a large\r\nchamber which imitates Rocky Mountain scenery and terminates at the\r\nCorkscrew Path which, as the name indicates, is a spiral path winding\r\ndown like a great stairway against the wall of an approximately circular\r\nchamber which is perhaps the highest in the cave, and shows the most\r\nviolent water-action. The plunging torrent rushed on from here to tear\r\nout the heavy rock and form the next chamber, known as Dante's Inferno,\r\nwhence, its force being divided, it went more gently in various\r\ndirections. And by one of these passages we now re-enter the main route\r\nof travel once more, and finally return to the face of the earth,\r\nwondering if it will be possible to so describe those wonderful scenes\r\nas to represent with even a limited degree of fairness or justice the\r\nawe-inspiring grandeur of the entire trip, or the perfection of fragile\r\nloveliness formed and preserved as by special miracles in the Garden of\r\nEden.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of this great journey was that the box work, so abundant\r\nin other portions of the cave, was here conspicuously absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRYSTAL PALACE.\r\n\r\nAnother route in Wind Cave is that to the Crystal Palace which, although\r\nthe shortest, is the one most seldom taken by visitors, because of a\r\ncertain amount of difficulty and discomfort being unavoidable. Only a\r\nportion of the great stairway below the entrance is descended, when we\r\nabandon it and climb into a hole in the side-wall of the narrow passage,\r\nfrom which point to the end of the trip our feet prove to be merely\r\nencumbrances.\r\n\r\nThe space crawled into and through widens sufficiently in several places\r\nto form chambers of good size, but the height of the ceiling is nowhere\r\nmore than three feet and most of it only two or even less. The rough\r\nrock floor is partly carpeted with patches of loose moist clay, which is\r\nthe means of our becoming as grimy as tramps, and its source is readily\r\naccounted for by an examination of the ceiling. This is easily made\r\nwhile resting one skinned elbow at the expense of the other. The word\r\n\"abraded\" is inadequate where anything approaching real cave study is\r\nattempted.\r\n\r\nThe box work of the ceiling has almost entirely lost its\r\ncrystallization, and is as ready to crumble as the enclosed clay, which\r\nis still retained because it had not yet reached the necessary point of\r\ndeterioration to be carried out before the great volume of water,\r\nrequired for that service, retired from this high level of the cave.\r\n\r\nWhen finally reached, the Crystal Palace proved worthy of the effort,\r\nits decoration being entirely of dripstone and very beautiful, although\r\non too small a scale to be compared with similar work in many caves: it\r\nis merely an attractive \"extra\" in Wind Cave, and not one of the\r\nimportant attractions that give the Cave the rank that may have a few\r\nequals but no superiors.\r\n\r\nThe first room is scarcely more than twelve feet in either direction and\r\nnot quite six feet high. The glassy ceiling is thickly studded with\r\nsmall stalactites from two to eighteen inches in length, and mostly of\r\nthe hollow \"pipe stem\" variety, from which the surplus drip rests in\r\nwhite masses on the clean floor around a central bowl of good clear\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nDown the middle of the wall directly opposite the entrance a rushing\r\nlittle white cascade has congealed, and on either side just under the\r\nceiling is a hollowed-out nook closely set with short stalactites and\r\nsmall columns, all pure white.\r\n\r\nNear by but not connected is another room too well filled to permit an\r\nentrance, but a portion of the wall having been carried out a\r\nsatisfactory view is not denied. Here the floor rises to within three\r\nfeet of the ceiling, and the deposit is much heavier, so that many fine\r\ncolumns rise from bases that spread and meet or overlap. If the cave had\r\nno greater claim to notice than these small drip rooms, it would still\r\nbe worthy of a visit.\r\n\r\nThe effort to secure flash-light pictures could only be considered\r\nsuccessful because there are none better to be had.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of Wind Cave is marvelously fresh and pure, and possesses\r\nin a high degree the invigorating quality which in most caves renders\r\nunusual exertion not only possible, but agreeable as well. In all the\r\nchambers and passages there is little change in the quality of the air,\r\nand thorough tests with a standard thermometer showed the variations on\r\nthe different levels, from the highest to the lowest, to be about 2°;\r\nbut on different days the range was from 45° to 52°. This curious state\r\nof affairs some one else will have to explain.\r\n\r\nThe only forms of life ever found in Wind Cave are a small fly and the\r\nmountain rat.\r\n\r\nWhile visiting the cave, every one connected with it was most kind and\r\nobliging, especially in showing those beautiful and difficult portions\r\nthat few visitors are so fortunate as to see. While this is very far\r\nfrom being a complete description even of the parts visited, it will\r\nserve to show what a truly grand cavern is located at the south end of\r\nthe Black Hills.\r\n\r\nThe elevation at Hot Springs is three thousand, four hundred feet, and\r\nthat of the entrance to the cave is four thousand and forty feet. A\r\nsource of disappointment in connection with Wind Cave is that its fine\r\nscenery cannot be effectively pictured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ONYX CAVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNorthwest of Hot Springs there is a group of three onyx caves, the\r\ndistance to them being estimated at from seven to ten miles, if the\r\nparty does not get lost, which is the usual fate of those who dispense\r\nwith the service of a driver familiar with the country. In going, the\r\nlonger way, over the hill-tops, claims a preference on account of\r\ndistant views with a favorable light. When the Onyx Cave Ranch is\r\nreached its scenery is found to be charming, with an ideal log house\r\noverlooking the cañon, and itself overlooked by the rising slope of the\r\nwooded hill. The entrance to the cave is in the opposite wall of the\r\ncañon, and is covered by a small cabin, at the door of which the view\r\ndemands a pause for admiration; then the party disappears down a narrow,\r\nrough, sloping passage of sufficient height for comfort to none but know\r\nthe value of comparative degrees. It soon appeared, however, that\r\npersonal comfort would travel only a short distance. The mud increased\r\nwith every step, and in its midst was a small hole through which it was\r\nnecessary to pass to the next lower level. This hole being so small and\r\nits walls slanting, the only way to accomplish the first half of the\r\ndescent was to sit down in the mud and slide, stopping half way to\r\nexamine a fine ledge of beautiful striped onyx, white and a brownish\r\npink, the first outcrop in the cave, but in the next level it is seen in\r\nrich abundance and variety; the colors being red, black and white, brown\r\nin several shades and pure white. All are handsome and of commercial\r\nquality and hardness; and just above them is a ledge of fine blue\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\nThe next chamber is called the Bad Lands, on account of a certain\r\nresemblance to that desolate region. The way into it is through the\r\nDevil's Corkscrew, a most uninviting passage because it stands on end\r\nand is about twelve feet deep with circular, perpendicular walls\r\ndiscouragingly free of prominent irregularities; but careful study\r\nreveals a few available crags and rough edges, by which the descent is\r\nmade. Fortunately the party decreased in size just within the entrance.\r\nClimbing up into a hole in the wall of this room, with no little\r\ndifficulty, the Aerial Lake is the reward of a breathless upward\r\nstruggle, and a satisfying one. The Lake is very small, but under its\r\nclear surface can be seen numerous growing deposits of calcite, while\r\nthe roof of onyx gleams with a mass of small white stalactites.\r\n\r\nReturning again to the main route and traveling to the end of a short\r\npassage we beheld the entrance to Red Hall, a piece of rope ladder\r\ndangling half way down a perpendicular wall, the other half having no\r\nhelp whatever. The way was clear so far as the length of the ladder, and\r\nwith trust in the future soon learned in cave work that distance was at\r\nonce passed, and sitting on the very narrow ledge to cogitate on the\r\npossibility of further progress, Mr. Sidey solved the problem by\r\nsuggesting, rather doubtfully, that the easiest way would be to drop off\r\nand allow him to interrupt the fall. This method had twice proved the\r\nonly means of advance in Wind Cave and can be termed rapid transit. The\r\nwalls of Red Hall are of stratified limestone variegated with patches of\r\nred rock, and clay of the same gay hue. It is the highest chamber in the\r\ncave and probably the largest. A hole in the wall at the floor level,\r\nnear the entrance to the passage beyond, gives a glimpse of the cave\r\nriver flowing on a slightly lower level, not over two feet below the\r\nfloor we stand on. The water is said to have a depth of fifteen feet,\r\nand a rock thrown in gave back the sound of a splash into water not\r\nshallow. Entering the passage already referred to, its dimensions\r\ndecreased to a crawl and then to a squeeze, so that most of its length\r\nwas taken in a very humble position, which permitted no regard to be\r\npaid to the ample mud or little pools of water that must be serenely\r\ndragged through as if carrying them away were an agreeable privilege.\r\nEven a muddy passage ends in time, and at last we gained a standing\r\npoint and after a short climb were in Fairies' Palace, a marvel of\r\ndainty beauty, and worthy of the distasteful trip just taken. We stood\r\nin a narrow passage that divided the small chamber like the central\r\naisle of a cathedral, above which the white roof formed a Gothic arch\r\nfrom which depended countless little stalactites and draperies, while on\r\neither side, six feet above the passage, was a floor of onyx supporting\r\nexquisite columns of which the highest are not more than three feet.\r\nOnly a short distance from the Fairies' Palace is the almost equally\r\nbeautiful Ethereal Hall, and connecting the two I had the pleasure to\r\ndiscover a small arched passage more beautiful than either.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fairies' Palace. Page 165.]\r\n\r\nAlthough much of the cave was still not visited, the long drive to town\r\ndemanded a return to the surface, but several stops were made on the way\r\nto admire masses of onyx and groups of curious forms in deposits of that\r\nfine stone. One high, crooked chimney above the Corkscrew is especially\r\nfine and correspondingly difficult for a grown person weighted down with\r\ngarments dripping mud and water; but Kimball Stone, our boy friend,\r\nscampered up like a squirrel.\r\n\r\nTwo of the Onyx Caves had not been seen at all and Mr. Sidey expressed\r\nspecial regret on account of the latest discovery as no woman had ever\r\nyet entered it; but the sun was low in the west and the road had some\r\ndangerous points that must be passed before dark, so the reeking skirt\r\nwas removed and without waiting to dry by the great fire kindled for the\r\npurpose we hurried off, promising to return if possible, and carrying\r\ntreasures in specimens, besides an ancient lemon, which may not be\r\ncalled a fossil, since soft substances are said not to fossilize; but\r\nhowever that may be, this is a perfect lemon whose particles have been\r\nreplaced with the lasting rock in the same way as the numerous Cycad\r\ntrunks in the same region have been preserved to prove to us\r\nconclusively that formerly the region flourished under tropical\r\nconditions, and supported an abundant animal life of tropical nature and\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving the ranch, we descended by a sort of goat-trail-road\r\ninto a grandly beautiful cañon, along the bed of which the road\r\ncontinues until it flows out as the water did in ages gone. By this time\r\nit had become quite dark, and the chill of the northwest night formed a\r\ncombination with saturated clothing that cannot be highly recommended as\r\na pleasure; but the natural chivalry which prompted our young escort to\r\ninsist on lending his own coat, and his evident disappointment that the\r\nsacrifice was not allowed, afforded a pleasure that will continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE ONYX CAVE.\r\n\r\nA few days later it was convenient to return to the Onyx Cave ranch with\r\nthe special object of entering the newest cave, which could be done with\r\nthe assistance of seventy feet of rope. While necessary preparations\r\nwere pending, a walk up the cañon was proposed. At a distance of perhaps\r\na quarter of a mile above Onyx Cave evidence was seen of a very\r\nremarkable form of ancient life. It is not the usual few bones but is a\r\ncast in the rock of the cañon bed of an animal clothed in its flesh. The\r\nappearance of the head, neck, body and wings is preserved, but the tail\r\nand four limbs have been carried away by eroding waters which even now\r\nhave not quite forsaken the cañon. The containing stratum is not seen in\r\nthe cañon wall, and near the lower end of the cañon a fine white\r\nsandstone crops out beneath. We ask: \"Was the cañon cut to its full\r\ndepth while yet a Cretaceous sea was depositing beach-sand, and did the\r\nearliest horse, with wings, appear at the close of that period? Or, did\r\nan animal with fore limbs developed, retain its wings into Miocene time\r\nand leave record of its life in an arm of the Tertiary lake?\" The body\r\nis that of a horse with wings attached to the shoulders. The head is\r\nunlike that of a modern horse, being much shorter and more rounded, but\r\nthe parted lips give a glimpse of the teeth of a young horse. If only\r\nthe feet could be found, I feel assured they would prove that the\r\nthree-toed horse of ancient time, so abundantly in evidence throughout\r\nthis region, was possessed of wings and in some way furnished the idea\r\nof Pegasus.\r\n\r\nA few feet further down the cañon are a pair of twisted wings that show\r\nthe animal to have perished in company with its mate, while trying to\r\nescape from a sudden flood that rushed down the cañon like a moving\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nAfter some uneasy discussion about the means of entering the new cave,\r\nit was finally decided that the available rope was too short and not of\r\nsufficient strength. This was, of course, a disappointment but not a\r\nsurprise, as a very peculiar quality in the rope used to enter caves of\r\nthis kind had come to notice before. The peculiarity is, that a rope\r\nentirely above suspicion for the safety of a two hundred pound man, at\r\nonce weakens and must be condemned when threatened with one hundred\r\npounds of woman's weight, yet there is an implied compliment hidden\r\nsomewhere about this protective system that tends to reduce the sting of\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nSo it was agreed to spend the afternoon in the White Onyx Cave, which is\r\ngenerally spoken of simply as the Upper Cave because it occupies a\r\nhigher level than the Onyx Cave already described, and is supposed to be\r\nan extension of the same although no connecting passage has been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying friend had not been costumed for caving, but was\r\npersuaded to accept a full suit of overalls, which needed the addition\r\nof a pick and pipe to make the picture perfect. Unfortunately a snap\r\nshot failed.\r\n\r\nThe entrance is in a perpendicular portion of the cañon wall, but a\r\nnarrow path that starts some distance away and appears in eminent danger\r\nof falling off, makes most of the ascent comparatively easy; and the\r\nbalance is completed by a short ladder whose rounds dip toward the cañon\r\nbed in a rather alarming manner, but this only proves the folly of\r\ngiving too much heed to appearances, for it is strong and firmly\r\nfastened to the rocks.\r\n\r\nJust within the entrance there is height sufficient for standing, but\r\nthe roof descends suddenly and the walls come near together, reducing\r\nthe passage to a crawl, and showing that in past times water poured in\r\nat this opening and not out as might be supposed. The first chamber\r\nentered is the Crystal Gallery, but it is so nearly filled with great\r\nmasses of pure white onyx no standing room remains. Drops of water on\r\nportions of the onyx ceiling here are the only moisture remaining in\r\nthis cave. When Mac's[5] head came in contact with the roof he called to\r\nthe guide: \"See here, little boy, you ought to sing out 'low bridge' at\r\nthat sort o' places, 'cause when I'm busy hunting a spot to set my foot\r\nin, I can't see what my head's coming to, and I like to mined a lot o'\r\nthis rock with it.\"\r\n\r\nSlowly, and with no danger and less comfort, we creep over, under and\r\nbetween great massive beds of the fine white crystalline rock until at\r\nlength we enter the Ghost Chamber where no onyx has been deposited, but\r\nwhere numerous mountain rats have evidently been at home for many years,\r\nif we may judge from the enormous quantity of pine needles with which\r\nthey have carpeted the floor. The walls show small box work crumbling to\r\ndust, and Ray climbed high into the chimney-like opening above our\r\nheads, but reported that it ended suddenly and had no attractions to\r\noffer.\r\n\r\nComing out, the way was somewhat varied, but more difficult, as the\r\npassages through the onyx beds were more irregular and more nearly\r\nclosed; Onyx Hall being only a fair specimen of the marvelous results\r\nachieved here by the persistent regularity of an uninterrupted but slow\r\ndrip, continued through hundreds of years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White Onyx Masses. Page 170.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking out of White Onyx Cave. Page 171.]\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that in all these heavy beds there is no line or\r\ntint, or slightest trace of color anywhere, while the other Onyx Cave,\r\nso near as to suggest connection, has a gorgeous variety of rich\r\ncoloring.\r\n\r\nThe view looking out from the entrance of White Onyx Cave is wonderfully\r\nfine, and equally so whether the rain falls or the sun shines, a timely\r\nshower giving us an opportunity to enjoy both.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the ranch, a promise was made by Mr. Sidey to write a\r\nshort description of the other cave, which he kindly did, and it is here\r\ngiven. He says:\r\n\r\n\"In trailing a deer I came across a hole on top of a long divide. On\r\nthrowing a rock down the opening, I could hear it rattling against the\r\nwalls until the sounds gradually died away, but there seemed to be no\r\nbottom to the hole, and I resolved to come again prepared and make\r\nexplorations. After the snow had gone my twelve-year-old son, Ray, and\r\nI, mounted on our trusty horses, Bonnie and Dee, equipped with ropes,\r\ncandles, hammers and a pocketful of matches, set out to explore the new\r\ncave. It was a beautiful, bright spring morning, and after an hour's\r\nhard climbing over fallen timber and rocks, we reached the summit of the\r\nmountain. A search of half an hour revealed the opening which was barely\r\nlarge enough to allow me to pass through.\r\n\r\n\"Fastening our ropes securely to a stout log rolled across the chasm, we\r\nbegan to pay it out, and although we did not feel it touch bottom, I\r\nstarted down to explore, the length of the rope at least. As I descended\r\nI found the opening gradually widened out to eight or ten feet, a sort\r\nof inverted funnel-shaped hole with irregular wall but smooth and\r\naffording little footing. As I neared the bottom I saw the end of the\r\nrope was within four feet of it, so I landed on terra firma and called\r\nto Ray, 'All right, come down!'\r\n\r\n\"Lighting our candles we found ourselves standing on a mound of pure\r\nonyx, and on looking around could see we were in an immense cavern,\r\nwhose walls sparkled and glittered as if studded with diamonds. Going\r\ndown twenty feet we found a smooth-floored room that measured three\r\nhundred feet in length, twenty five feet in width, and thirty feet in\r\nheight. The walls were solid white onyx lined or banded with pink and\r\ngolden stripes. The ceiling was arched, and draped in fantastic shapes,\r\nand hung with stalactites innumerable. The room was so large and the\r\ndrapery and festooning so delicate and beautiful, that we were filled\r\nwith awe and could not speak for a time.\r\n\r\n\"At last we started to further explore this wonderland. On going to the\r\nfarther end of the room we found a passage leading on. This we followed\r\nfor a hundred feet and found the whole cavern lined with onyx and\r\ncrystals clear as glass. After loading up with specimens we retraced our\r\nsteps and on reaching the large room we had first entered we heard a\r\nroaring, rumbling noise. An awful noise truly, which filled us with an\r\nunknown dread.\r\n\r\n\"On approaching the entrance we saw a stream of water pouring down,\r\ncompletely filling the hole.\r\n\r\n\"For a moment we felt like rats caught in a trap, our only way of egress\r\noccupied by a stream of water falling straight down seventy feet, and\r\nthen we wondered how long it would take to fill up the room.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly the thought that there might be an outlet for the water gave\r\nus new hope, so we went to see and sure enough we found a natural\r\nwater-course down through an opening we had overlooked. We gathered up\r\ncourage once more, and thought the best thing would be something to\r\noccupy our time. So we set to work getting out more specimens and in a\r\ncouple of hours the water stopped running and we were ourselves once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n\"Ray grasped the rope, which was soaking wet, and went up the seventy\r\nfeet, hand over hand, like a cat. I, being heavier, found it quite\r\ndifferent from going down. The rope played whip-cracker with me for some\r\ntime and before reaching the top I was covered with bruises. But\r\ndaylight never appeared so beautiful before.\r\n\r\n\"Here we found the cause of so much water. A cloud-burst had occurred on\r\nthe Divide and a large portion of it had poured down the passage way to\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\n\"We found our horses patiently waiting for us and night closing in.\r\nMounting we rode rapidly home, resolved never to venture into this cave\r\nagain without leaving some one at the entrance to give warning in case\r\nof danger.\r\n\r\n\"John F. Sidey.\"\r\n\r\nThe first specimen taken out was given to us on our first visit to the\r\nranch, and is pure white with a stripe of brilliant golden yellow.\r\nHaving been invited to give a name to this new find it seems quite\r\nproper after reading the description of the deluge and seeing the bright\r\nbands of color, and considering the hopeful promise of future\r\npossibilities, to call it The Rainbow Cave.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] Colored driver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nCRYSTAL CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota can boast of yet another cave in the Black Hills that was\r\nformed by volcanic disturbance of the rocks and afterwards decorated in\r\na manner peculiar to itself. This is Crystal Cave. It is nine miles from\r\nPiedmont in the eastern edge of the Hills, and easily visited from that\r\npoint by way of the narrow-gauge road, which winds along the natural\r\ncurves of the beautiful Elk Creek cañon, whose walls are said to expose\r\na depth of almost a mile of geological strata, although the exposure at\r\nany one point does not exceed three hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe disappointment of not having seen this cave during the summer visit\r\nto the Hills grew as the weeks passed, and a request that the owner\r\nshould send a description was answered with an assurance that it was\r\nimpossible. Therefore, on Friday, November 13th, 1896, with a small\r\nnephew, Herbert A. Owen, Jr., for company, the trip was undertaken a\r\nsecond time to complete the unfinished mission.\r\n\r\nThe first glimpse of the Hills is at Edgemont in the early morning, but\r\nthe train makes its way to the north through the heart of the uplift,\r\ntwisting about the curves of the hills and clinging to the sides of a\r\nbeautiful cañon whose high walls give way here and there to fine slopes\r\ndensely covered with forests of pine and spruce. These look black in the\r\ndistance and suggested the name of Black Hills to the Indians, who\r\nalways have a reason for the names they give even to their children.\r\n\r\nThere are great tracts where fire has killed part or all of the timber\r\nbut left much of it standing, while in other places nature has defied\r\nthe power of fire and the hills are re-clothed with young trees. A\r\nrecent storm had further beautified the region with a few inches of\r\nsnow, but as the day advanced a chinook began to blow so that when\r\nDeadwood was reached, soon after noon, only the northern exposures\r\nretained an appearance of winter.\r\n\r\nDeadwood is a most peculiar little city and very attractive in its\r\npeculiarity, being crowded snugly into a depression between a number of\r\nsteep pine-wooded hills, which gives an appearance suggestive of a\r\nbird's nest securely located among the forks of a branching tree, and as\r\nis the case in a nest, business is chiefly transacted at the lowest\r\ndepth of the enclosure. As the busy center of a great gold-mining\r\nregion, the metropolis of the Hills, and the outgrowth of an exciting\r\nhistorical past, it claims and receives interesting attention. And while\r\nthe whole Black Hills region is still distinctly a man's country, it\r\nis called woman's paradise, and surely nowhere else are the daughters of\r\nEve received with a more gracious courtesy or surrounded by an equally\r\nunobtrusive protecting care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Approaching Deadwood. Page 176.]\r\n\r\nThe streets leading up to the residences lack very little of standing on\r\nend, and the houses appear to have been hung in place by means of hooks\r\nand wire cord like pictures on a wall. The smelter has no reception day\r\nbut admits visitors as if their pleasure were a guarantee of profit.\r\n\r\nThe finest scenery in the Hills is said to be that of the Spearfish\r\nCañon, north of Deadwood, and the finest of that at the Falls, but this\r\nmay be doubtful as other points are very beautiful, especially where the\r\nBurlington & Missouri Road requires a distance of seven miles to climb\r\nthe cañon wall.\r\n\r\nPiedmont being the nearest town to Crystal Cave, we took the early\r\nevening train on the Elk Horn Road and soon were located, and shocked to\r\nlearn that the proprietor of the cave had started several days before to\r\ndrive to Wind Cave for specimens. The cave was closed and no one there.\r\nThe trip had been taken for the one purpose of exploring Crystal Cave,\r\nand a letter sent in advance to announce our coming, but the train\r\ncarrying it was an hour late so he drove off without the mail.\r\n\r\nThere seemed at first nothing to be done but take the next returning\r\ntrain, which, under the circumstances, was objectionable. A night's rest\r\nand a telegram that had to be sent twelve miles by special messenger,\r\nimproved the situation. The proprietor was unavoidably detained at Wind\r\nCave, but secured a reliable guide, expressed me the cave keys, and has\r\nsince married the \"specimen\" he had gone in quest of. May great\r\nhappiness dwell at the cave many years!\r\n\r\nThe morning of the third day after our arrival found arrangements all\r\ncomplete, and soon after the train left Piedmont it entered Elk Creek\r\nCañon, which is always beautiful, but on that morning was exceptionally\r\nso on account of a sudden change in the weather having covered every\r\nvisible portion of the passing landscape with heavy frost. The trees on\r\ndistant hills that ordinarily are black, were, for once, all softly\r\nwhite, and when the tall pines in the cañon were shaken by a breeze,\r\nthey cast a shower of flakes like snow.\r\n\r\nHere the cañon walls are in Carboniferous Limestone with a pleasing\r\nvariety of color in the strata, and the erosion-carving not overdone,\r\nthe most notable piece being the Knife-blade. This, at first view,\r\nappears to be a high, round tower, but the train following the curve,\r\nreveals the fact that it is not a tower, but a thin, curved\r\nknife-blade. The sun just for one instant shone through a rift in the\r\nclouds, and added special charm to the scene.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Knife-Blade. Page 178.]\r\n\r\nA short distance beyond is Crystal Cave station, where the guide was\r\nwaiting to take us in charge. He is an intelligent young man who has\r\nserved an enlistment term in the army, is recently married, very\r\nobliging, and proud of being trustworthy.\r\n\r\nThe scenery here is most beautiful as well as grand. The cañon makes a\r\nsharp turn toward the south, and on the north opens out into another\r\ncañon of even greater beauty and higher walls, the perpendicular being\r\nthree hundred feet in places. Crystal Cave is in the hill embraced by\r\nthe junction curve. The natural entrance is more than two hundred feet\r\nabove the cañon bed and was naturally approached from above. A short\r\nwalk up the north cañon, whose name has unfortunately slipped away, was\r\nover ice and snow the chinook had failed to reach, and brought us to a\r\nlong stairway against the wall, which affords a more direct approach\r\nthan nature gave and is a fair test of physical perfection.\r\n\r\nFinally a resting place is reached where the grandeur of the view can be\r\nenjoyed; and then a shorter stairway completes the ascent of the wall,\r\nbut not of the hill, so there is still a considerable upward walk\r\nthrough the forest of tall pines all carpeted with brilliant mats of\r\nkinnikinic with its shining leaves, glowing in shades of green and red,\r\ntrying to rival the bright scarlet berries. The kinnikinic here\r\nresembles the wintergreen of the east, while in the mountains in\r\nColorado it grows in the form of a shrub two to three feet in height,\r\nbut with no variation in the leaf or berry.\r\n\r\nAt last perserverance is rewarded with a view of the cave buildings and\r\nthe summit of the hill rising yet higher beyond, and tall, straight\r\npines swaying in the rising wind over all.\r\n\r\nOne of the two houses was entered and preparations quickly made for\r\nentering the cave, the artificial tunnel entrance being only a little\r\ndistance further on.\r\n\r\nThe door was unlocked, candle-sticks taken from a shelf within, candles\r\nfrom the guide's supply lighted, and we went forward at last, into\r\nCrystal Cave. At the end of the new tunnel, a second door was passed\r\nthrough, which is locked on the inside during the visiting season by the\r\nlast guide to enter, in order that no chance late arrival may enter\r\nalone and be lost.\r\n\r\nThe first room is a small one at the junction of the natural and\r\nartificial entrances, from which we go upstairs to the Resting Room, in\r\nthe highest level of the cave, and perfectly dry but otherwise of no\r\nspecial interest. After a short rest here we went down stairs at the\r\nside opposite that on which we entered, into a passage leading to the\r\ncave's first beauty, the Red Room. As the name indicates, the walls are\r\nvividly colored and represent the uncertain line which separates the\r\nCarboniferous strata from the Triassic rocks. The color is handsomely\r\nbrought out here in contrast with masses of calcite crystal, so as to\r\npresent by the combination a charmingly beautiful room, from which we\r\nretired, feet first, down a \"squeeze\" to the Bridal Chamber, where we\r\nfound ourselves perched on an irregular narrow ledge, high up on the\r\nwall, and cherishing a private conviction that exploration had met a\r\ncheckmate; but the guide reached the floor and my nephew, Herbert,\r\nscrambled down with as much ease as the chipmunk he had chased to the\r\nhouse top a while before; so a little application settled the difficulty\r\nand re-united the party. The room is an artistic study in red, and the\r\nonly reason for its being called the Bridal Chamber is that the way out\r\nis decidedly more rough and difficult than that by which the entrance is\r\neffected; this, however, is an observation not based on official\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nOff to one side of this room is Lost Man's Paradise, also in red and\r\ncrystal, named in honor of the timely rescue of one who had faced the\r\npossibility of becoming a lost soul.\r\n\r\nAnother Fat Man's Misery, on a lower level, leads from the Bridal\r\nChamber to the Big Dome, a large room with a fine dome-shaped ceiling\r\nfrom which heavy masses of crystals have fallen to the floor; and down a\r\nsteep incline from here is Reef Rock, an immense fallen rock with box\r\nwork on the under side, which at one time served to ornament the\r\nceiling; and now this rock marks the beginning of Poverty Flat, a broad,\r\nlow passage of great extent, that has been robbed of all its wonderful\r\ntreasure of crystal and ends in a steep, rough declivity named Bunker\r\nHill by the guides who dreaded to mount it when going out loaded with\r\nspecimens. At the foot of the Hill is a bowlder of enormous size and\r\nwith a pointed top, known as Pyramid Rock and giving the same name to\r\nthe large room in which it stands.\r\n\r\nEvery portion of Crystal Cave has at one time been heavily crusted with\r\ncalcite crystals, mainly of the dog-tooth variety, and any barren places\r\nare so either because the surface has been removed for specimens, or\r\nthrown down by the violence of an earthquake. But where the latter has\r\nbeen the cause of removal, the crystals have in most cases been renewed,\r\nwhich is amply evidenced by the fallen masses being crystallized on all\r\nsides; and these as well as most of the walls, are not covered thinly\r\nwith one crust, but layer has been added to layer until the thickness\r\nis four to ten inches and often more. The ceilings that have been\r\ndenuded by nature's forces during the same early period when water\r\nfilled the cave were also renewed.\r\n\r\nFrom the Pyramid Room a narrow fissure forms a passage to the Cactus\r\nChamber, where there is a marvelous floor on which the crystals are in\r\nbunches like cacti, and the beautiful ceiling is the finest and most\r\nirregular unbroken mass of crystal yet seen.\r\n\r\nPassing through a round hole known as the Needle's Eye, we enter\r\nStatuary Hall, where the latest inrush of water has eroded the sharp\r\npoints from the crystals, leaving only smooth surfaces, and at the same\r\ntime done much curious carving, the most conspicuous pieces of this work\r\nbeing a bear and the heads of an Indian and his baby.\r\n\r\nOut from the Hall are two important routes, one down the steep incline\r\nof Beaver's Slide to The Catacombs, and another, which we followed\r\nfirst, is through Rocky Run, a rough and rocky pass, to a large and\r\nhandsomely crystallized chamber called the I.X.L. Room, on account of\r\nthose three letters, over twelve inches in height, being distinctly and\r\nconspicuously worked in crystal on a magnificent piece of box work that\r\nwould weigh nearly half a ton, for which an offer of five hundred\r\ndollars is said to have been refused.\r\n\r\nThe next chamber beyond is Tilotson Hall, very large and extremely\r\nrough, and named in honor of a teacher from the Normal School, who\r\ndelivered an address here that gave much pleasure to both visitors and\r\nguides.\r\n\r\nThe way to farther advance is now more difficult and through a jagged\r\ncrevice of threatening appearance, but the trip is made in safety and\r\nwith comparative ease, and brings us into Notre Dame, one of the largest\r\nchambers in the cave and perhaps the finest, although where so much is\r\nfine that may be uncertain. The display of box work and crystal is\r\nsufficiently gorgeous to do honor to the famous old cathedral of France,\r\nthe ceiling especially being a masterpiece of the builder's and\r\ndecorator's arts; but the grandest portion, which a visitor recently\r\nreturned from foreign travel called The Russian Castle, on account of\r\nthe magnificence of the large box work and pearly crystal masses, should\r\nrather be known as the great cathedral's crowning glory, The Altar.\r\n\r\nAnother large room, the handsome Council Chamber, is entered just as\r\nthat Altar of pearl is lost to view; and from there an up-hill trip is\r\ntaken through a narrow crevice to Whale Flat, which is the natural\r\nhistory room, with a large whale as the show specimen.\r\n\r\nGoing out from here we enter another crevice which serves as a steep\r\nstairway descending to a lower level, and measures from top to bottom\r\none hundred and eighteen feet. This is called Rip Van Winkle's Stairway,\r\nand although merely a high and crooked crack in the rock, is very\r\nbeautiful because heavily coated with crystal, the effect being\r\nespecially striking at the top where the crystal is partly worn away and\r\nleaves exposed patches of red rock.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the Stairway is the first room containing water, and is\r\ncalled the Gypsy Camp. It is the most charming chamber yet visited, with\r\nnot the smallest spot of plain or common rock visible. The ceiling,\r\nwalls, floor, and groups of fallen rocks, are all unbroken masses of\r\npearly calcite in crystals of varied sizes, with here and there a patch\r\ncoated over with pure white carbonate of lime, or supporting a bunch of\r\nfragile egg-shell, which is a thin, hollow crust of lime carbonate,\r\nalmost invariably having the pointed form of the dog-tooth spar. And\r\nthere are also beautiful mats and banks of dainty white carbonate\r\nflowers. While waiting here for the guide to go in quest of the lunch we\r\nhad carelessly left behind, the time was utilized in measuring the room,\r\nwhich is a small one. The size of the cave and our limited time for\r\nseeing it, prevented much-desired measurements from being taken in all\r\nparts of the cave.\r\n\r\nThis room was found to be forty-eight feet long, the irregular width\r\nvaried from fourteen to thirty feet and the height from four and\r\none-half to ten feet. The crystal water basin is especially beautiful\r\nand the water so clear that we stood looking into it with\r\ndisappointment, being thirsty and thinking it dry, until the guide\r\nlaughingly dipped and offered a cupful. The basin is the segment of a\r\ncircle rounding beneath a massive, overhanging crystal ledge of\r\nwonderful beauty, and is nine feet long by two in width. This room and\r\nthe Stairway into it are alone worthy of a visit, but there is much that\r\nis finer still.\r\n\r\nOut of Gypsy Camp by way of Gunny Sack Crawl, so named by the workmen\r\nwho spread gunny sacks to relieve the torture of crawling over the\r\nbeautiful floor of sharp crystals, we enter the first chamber, where\r\nactive operation is still maintained and certain branches of the great\r\ndecorative industry of the cave may be carefully studied. This operative\r\nchamber, which is unnamed, would no doubt be called a factory in the\r\neast, but in its own locality would more likely be referred to as The\r\nWorks.\r\n\r\nThe next chamber entered is Crystal Flat, whose floor is completely\r\ncovered with immense crystal blocks, and the wonderful crystal ceiling\r\nis exceedingly fine. But time being limited we must pass on into the\r\nLake Room, where is Crystal Lake, the largest body of water in the cave.\r\nIt is about thirty feet long by fifteen wide and its greatest depth\r\nis said to be ten feet. The water is cold and clear, and the gold fish\r\nintroduced as an experiment three years ago are said to have grown\r\nrapidly but not yet turned white, and are not known to have become\r\nblind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bridal Veil. Page 187.]\r\n\r\nAt some little distance from Crystal Lake, and not within the same range\r\nof vision, although in the same room, is Dry Lake, which to the surprise\r\nof the guide we found to be not dry, but full of limpid water through\r\nwhich we could distinctly see the delicate clusters of crystals it is\r\ndepositing. They are of a pale honey yellow and are called Gum-drops on\r\naccount of the resemblance to that variety of confection.\r\n\r\nThe name Dry Lake was given because in blasting out a passage a\r\nmisdirected shot went through the bottom of the Lake, which in\r\nconsequence was soon drained; but the heavily charged water has sealed\r\nup the unfortunate break, and resumed its interrupted work. The ceiling\r\ndrops to a height of little more than three feet directly above the Lake\r\nmargin, and is a beautiful crystal mass, which at a little distance down\r\nthe sloping floor appears as the background for a fine piece of cave\r\nstatuary called The Bridal Veil, and formed of cream-tinted dripstone.\r\nNot a great deal of imagination is required to see a slender girlish\r\nfigure completely enveloped in the flowing folds of a wedding veil that\r\nfalls lightly about her feet. The figure itself is three feet ten inches\r\nin height and stands on an almost flat circular base of the same\r\nmaterial, that measures nine inches in depth and two feet eight inches\r\nin diameter. At times the water rises sufficiently to cover the base, in\r\nproof of which it left a fringe-like border of small sharp crystals,\r\nsuch as could be formed only beneath the water's surface. Most of this\r\nborder has, unfortunately, been chiseled off for specimens, but will be\r\nrenewed in time if left undisturbed; and that condition can easily be\r\nsecured with a few feet of wire netting.\r\n\r\nTo one side of this room is a most daintily beautiful alcove so\r\nprofusely decorated with fragile forms of dripstone that a passage\r\nthrough it without causing damage is extremely difficult. This alcove is\r\nabout twenty-five feet in either direction, with a sloping floor almost\r\ncovered with stalagmitic growths above the earlier deposit of sharp\r\ncrystals, and many of these rise in slender columns to the glass-like\r\nceiling, which varies in height from three to six feet and is thickly\r\nstudded with small stalactites of both varieties--the pointed, solid\r\nform, and those of uniform size, which are always hollow like a pipe\r\nstem. The central ornament is the Chimes, a musical group of stalactites\r\nwhich is scarcely more beautiful than Cleopatra's Needle, at a\r\ndistance of a few feet to one side, a transparent column four feet\r\nin height and having an average circumference of seventeen inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Chimes. Page 188.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Needle. Page 188.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tower of Babel. Page 189.]\r\n\r\nThe Abode of the Fairies is a similar, though smaller room, with The\r\nTower of Babel for a handsome show-piece. While this portion of the cave\r\nis extremely attractive, the measurements given show that in comparison\r\nwith caves of other states the drip deposit here is too small to be\r\nreckoned an important feature in itself, but in conjunction with the\r\nmiles of calc-spar that give the cave a character distinctly its own, it\r\nwell repays all attention.\r\n\r\nLeaving Lake Room we enter a newly opened, long, dry passage to Slab\r\nRoom, where a comparatively recent earthquake has shaken down the\r\nornamental ceiling and spread it in great slabs over the floor; and\r\nhaving since remained perfectly dry it has the appearance of being the\r\nwork of yesterday. This room is remembered as the one in which a party\r\nof workers were lost, and one of their number gave a severe nervous\r\nshock to the junior proprietor by suggesting that as he was acting as\r\nguide and unable to lead them out, it was only right that he should be\r\nthe first victim to satisfy their hunger. A rescuing party with\r\nextinguished candles was listening behind a rock to the blood-curdling\r\nspeech, and came forward to restore cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nA long, irregular, frosty looking crevice called Jack Frost Streak,\r\nconducts us from Slab Room and ends at Mold Ladder, on which we pause to\r\nadmire a wonderful growth of snow-white cave vegetation, before\r\nascending into Santa Claus' Pass, the longest passage in the cave. It is\r\na rough crevice named from the fact of being discovered on Christmas\r\nEve, and ends at the Government Room on the main tourist route where a\r\nU.S. pack saddle and apparently portable bath tub are conspicuous.\r\n\r\nNext beyond is a very large room named New Zealand, on account or its\r\nicy appearance and the undisputed possession of a seal. This room in\r\nturn opens into Mold Chamber, where an old board platform, formerly used\r\nfor the display of specimens, has fostered the most marvelously\r\nbeautiful growth of mold: it hangs in ropes five and six feet long, with\r\ntasseled ends, and in broad, looped draperies; but is most beautiful\r\nwhere it has taken possession of the rocks and spreads out on the flat\r\nsurface like large open fans, with deep, soft feather borders.\r\n\r\nHaving been in the cave eight hours, we now followed the outward passage\r\nfrom Mold Chamber and soon reached an open trap door where the guide\r\nsuggested to Herbert that he would be afraid to go down alone and allow\r\nhim to close the door; but the child surprised him by quietly stepping\r\ndown and then asking why he wished it, only to be told \"because we are\r\ncoming too.\" Which we did and found ourselves in the main entrance\r\npassage, and in due time returned to the outer world where a terrific\r\nwind was roaring through the tall pines and the early winter evening had\r\nalready closed in dark.\r\n\r\nThe guide locked the cave, walked with us to the house where he lighted\r\na lamp and left us to prepare for the return to town; but the lamp,\r\nbelonging to a bachelor, was empty, so we made our preparations in\r\nimitation of the blind. On the guide's return he lighted a candle, but\r\nsuggested that twenty minutes were generally allowed for reaching the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nThe house was accordingly closed and as we walked down the long, curving\r\nslope to the stairway, he told of a new and unknown bob-tailed wolf that\r\nhas recently made its first appearance among the hills in considerable\r\nnumbers and to the terror of stock. It attacks and bites horses or\r\ncattle, and after waiting for the fatal poison inflicted to take effect,\r\nfalls to and eats the victim.\r\n\r\nThe uncovered platform which serves as a station being reached a few\r\nminutes before the train arrived, I expressed an unwillingness to detain\r\nour guide longer on account of his having a walk of four and a half\r\nmiles to his home; but he declined to consider the subject; saying he\r\nhad been directed not to leave us until we were taken safely on the\r\ntrain, which came sweeping round the curve on time and stopped for us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nCRYSTAL CAVE CONCLUDED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to agreement the guide again met us at the station on the\r\nfollowing morning, for another day in the cave, which we entered with no\r\nunnecessary loss of time, and hurrying through the main entrance\r\npassage, Government Room and Statuary Hall, went down Beaver Slide,\r\nwhich, on the previous day, we had passed to enter Rocky Run. Our\r\ndescent into the crevice took us past those portions known as Suspension\r\nBridge and Rebecca's Well, and over some very \"rough country\" to the\r\nmost wonderful parts of the cave. Numerous passages open out in various\r\ndirections; one to rooms of frost work of great beauty; another to the\r\nRibbon Room where the drip deposits on the walls are in ribbon-like\r\nstripes of red, yellow, and white, while others yet are ways to the\r\nCatacombs. And it is the Catacombs we particularly wish to see, as they\r\nmost perfectly represent the individual character of the cave and have,\r\nas yet, received no injury from either time or man; but is a region as\r\ndifficult to travel as the way of the transgressor, and many miles can\r\nbe traversed with no prospect of coming to the end. But where locomotion\r\nis so slow and painful, the owner of a pedometer would find that\r\ninstrument a discouraging companion and soon learn better than to\r\nconsult its record publicly.\r\n\r\nThe Catacombs are a series of connected fissures and small crevices in\r\nwhich every inch of exposed surface is covered with clear, translucent,\r\nalmost transparent, calcite crystals, neither coated with lime nor\r\nstained with clay; nor even is the pearly lustre dimmed with the\r\nslightest trace of dust. The crystals are very sharp and of all sizes,\r\nranging from half an inch to three and a half inches in length, the\r\nlarger sizes being conspicuously abundant. The entire region is an\r\nenormously large, perfectly formed, and undamaged geode. In reality, the\r\nwhole cave is a great cluster of connected geodes, and a similar work\r\nprobably does not exist, but if it does, has never been discovered. The\r\nfissures from which it is formed were opened by volcanic violence and\r\nthen enlarged, and afterwards decorated by the varied power of water, in\r\naction or repose.\r\n\r\nWhen the storms toward the close of the Tertiary period suddenly\r\noverwhelmed with floods the dense growth of tropical vegetation and\r\nmultitudinous animal life in the Northwest, the waters necessarily\r\nbecame heavily charged with the naturally resulting carbonic acid gas,\r\nand this, acting on the limestone rocks, would decompose them, leaving a\r\nresidual clay and taking the chief portions of the mineral components in\r\nsolution, to be afterwards deposited according to circumstances and\r\nconditions; and these are indicated by the various results found in Wind\r\nCave, Crystal Cave, the Onyx Caves and the Bad Lands. The latter being\r\nprevious to that time by no means \"bad,\" but richly luxuriant in\r\ntropical vegetation, which gave shelter from the heat to great numbers\r\nof curious animals.\r\n\r\nSome approximate idea of the extreme age of these caves may be gained\r\nfrom the fact that bones of a three-toed horse have been discovered in a\r\nchamber of Crystal Cave that must be practically unchanged since the\r\nremains were carried in from the outside, as otherwise they would have\r\nbeen buried beneath the fallen masses of crystal covered rock with which\r\nthe entire floor is cumbered. And yet this room is so remote from any\r\npresent connection with the outer world that it is impossible for their\r\nintroduction to have taken place in recent times.\r\n\r\nIn the beautiful Catacombs progress is as slow as in a cactus thicket or\r\na blackberry patch. The crevices lack none of the usual crevice\r\nirregularities; high places must be mounted or descended, chasms crossed\r\nand narrow passages crawled through, while extra caution must be\r\nexercised to avoid striking the head or making a misstep that might\r\nresult in a fall. The hands are in constant use and soon become so\r\nsensitive that holding a soft handkerchief gives infinite relief; but\r\nthe worst experience is the \"crawls\" where only the soles of the feet,\r\nbeing temporarily turned up, seem safe from the savage treatment of the\r\nsharp calcite dog-teeth. The worst crawl encountered was a small one\r\nhaving a downward slope with a jump-off at the end which necessitated\r\nits being taken feet first. Fortunately it was short. But in no place do\r\nthe difficulties outweigh the pleasure of beholding scenes of such\r\nbeauty, or suggest regret for the time, torn garments, and personal\r\nexertion required for its enjoyment.\r\n\r\nIn many portions of the cave the surface layer of crystals has had the\r\npoints worn away by the action of water, later than that in which they\r\nwere formed; but in the Catacombs and other extensive regions as well,\r\nthe finished work of crystallization is preserved in an absolutely\r\nperfect condition. And everywhere the largest crystals are on the under\r\nside of a projection or the roof of a cavity.\r\n\r\nAs the day was passing far too rapidly and many points of special\r\ninterest yet remained unseen, we turned with reluctance from the beauty\r\nand relief from the hardships of exploration in the Catacombs, and made\r\nour way over a crevice into Santa Claus' Pass, which was traversed for\r\na considerable distance and then abandoned for a low crawl terminating\r\nat the Senate Chamber. This is a large room extending to Poverty Flat,\r\nand is brilliantly red and purely white, most of the crystal presenting\r\na smooth surface. Under the Senate Chamber there is said to be some fine\r\nbox work which we had no time to visit. The name of this chamber was\r\ngiven by a visiting party composed of members of both houses of\r\nCongress. A smaller room, which is really an extension of the Senate\r\nChamber, has handsome walls of white and red box work on account of\r\nwhich the same distinguished party called it the Senate Post-office.\r\n\r\nFrom here a difficult crawl, through red rock, well-worn by the action\r\nof water, leads to the Starr Chamber, another large room in white and\r\nred, and named by Senator Starr of South Dakota.\r\n\r\nOpening out from the last room is a curious, dangerous looking, narrow,\r\ncrevice-chamber known as Suicide Room on account of the threatening\r\nappearance of over-hanging rocks, some of which have at times fallen in\r\ngreat masses of various sizes to form an irregular floor; and a descent\r\nof this is necessary in order to reach a short and extremely rough\r\ncrawl, beautifully and painfully decorated with sharp crystals above and\r\nbelow and on the sides. From this we emerge into Rainy Chamber, an\r\nelliptical room not less than two hundred feet long by one hundred feet\r\nwide, with a tent-like ceiling rising high in the center and sloping\r\ndown to meet the floor, which also slopes irregularly toward a deep\r\ncentral depression, giving the room a greater height than any other\r\nvisited. The high points are generally seen in the narrow crevices,\r\nwhile the rooms of generous length and breadth are usually low, many of\r\nthe largest having an average of five feet or even less.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is frequent intersection of crevices, and each chamber\r\nhas passages leading out on every side, the general direction of the\r\ncave is said to be northwest-southeast.\r\n\r\nRainy Chamber is named from the fact that during the early months of\r\nsummer water falls constantly in the form of a light shower; but it\r\ndrips at all times, and in consequence there is an opportunity to study\r\nthe active process of formation of one of the deposits which is very\r\nabundant in Wind Cave and considered the most perplexing. This is the\r\npop-corn, and the theories of its origin have been steadily rejected at\r\nWind Cave because of a doubt being entertained as to whether it has been\r\ndeposited under water or by drippings. Here in Rainy Chamber it is fully\r\nexplained. Near the center of the room the fallen masses are heavily\r\ncrystallized, much of the groundwork being fine box work and the\r\ncrystals in perfect condition. On these crystals the pop-corn is being\r\nformed, and specimens can be seen in all stages of development, from the\r\nbeginning to an approximate degree of finish; and whatever the position\r\nit occupies on the receiving surface, either on top, underneath, or on a\r\nside exposure, it always maintains the same relative position as growing\r\nplants on the mundane sphere. The water falling on the upper surface in\r\nscattering drops forms myriads of minute stalagmites; on side positions\r\nthe falling drop first strikes the point exposed to its line of descent\r\nand then spreads. The scant moisture slowly makes its way down sloping\r\nsides and shelving edges, leaving on each small irregularity a tiny\r\nportion of its volume, to deposit an infinitely small charge of solid\r\nsubstance, and the balance finally hangs in moisture less than drops on\r\nthe growing grains of the under surface.\r\n\r\nPop-corn, therefore, is the globular aragonite of the stalagmitic\r\nvariety. A small specimen from Rainy Chamber, placed beside one of the\r\nsame color from Wind Cave, shows them to be absolutely alike.\r\n\r\nRainy Chamber is the room in which the bones of the three-toed horse,\r\nalready referred to, were found, but their presence has not yet been\r\nexplained; therefore the case is open to conjecture and several\r\ntheories may be advanced and their values considered. The first question\r\nwhen such a discovery is made, is whether the living animal was possibly\r\na cave-dweller; which, as the horse was not, is quickly disposed of and\r\nattention turned to the next, the possibility of a carniverous animal\r\nhaving carried his prey into the dark recesses of the cave in order that\r\nthe enjoyment of his dinner might be undisturbed. This theory is equally\r\nunavailable by reason of the topographical features presented. If the\r\npresent natural entrance to the cave were the only way into this room\r\nfrom the outside, the distance was too great and beset with many\r\ndifficulties; besides which the final passage is too small to admit an\r\nanimal of sufficient size to carry any considerable portion of even a\r\nvery small horse. But if at that period the room had direct\r\ncommunication with the outside through an opening since closed, the\r\nshape of the walls indicate that it must have been a pot-hole in the\r\nroof, and through this an animal could have entered by falling, which\r\nthe horse and others may have done. But it seems most probable that the\r\nremains were carried in by the water through such a hole before it was\r\nclosed at the beginning of the Quaternary period, when the erosion of\r\nthe Hills was most active.\r\n\r\nRainy Chamber also contains a large and beautiful assortment of the\r\nsmall polished and coated pebbles called cave pearls.\r\n\r\nThe guide being anxious that we should not fail to see the Niagara Room,\r\nwe now turned toward a low, broad opening in the wall, a short distance\r\nto the right of the entrance, where the rising floor and descending\r\nceiling, failing to meet, had overlapped; so we made our way up a steep,\r\nsmooth bank, and then down on the other side over a broken, rocky\r\nsurface for a distance of about twenty feet, when the roof at last\r\njoined the floor and two small water-worn holes at the point of junction\r\nrevealed an untempting passage within. The broader of these holes was\r\nthree feet, but too low to be considered an entrance; the other was\r\nround but certainly not so large as our guide, who was preparing to\r\nenter it with doubts of his ability to make the trip, on account of\r\nhaving increased in size since his one entrance there, on which occasion\r\ntwo smaller guides pulled him through the tightest places. Carefully\r\ncomparing his size with that of the hole he sat beside, there was no\r\npossibility of doubt that if the attempt were made he would stick fast,\r\nand that would place our little party in dire straits. Consequently I\r\ninsisted that it should not be, but he was unwilling that Niagara should\r\nbe missed when so near. Finally I positively refused to go unless he\r\nwould consent to give us instructions and remain where he was while we\r\nwent without him, to which he at last yielded with extreme\r\nunwillingness. He had frequently shown us the guide's marks, and now\r\nearnestly cautioned me to advance only as they point, and turn back if\r\nthey should fail.\r\n\r\nThe small nephew went on a reconnoitering expedition to the end of the\r\npassage, and reported that the jump-off there was higher than himself\r\nbut he could get down. I now crawled through the hole and found the\r\npassage to be a \"crawl\" or rather a \"sprawl,\" from fifteen to eighteen\r\ninches high, but having an ample width varying from three to six feet.\r\nThe smooth, straight floor has a steep downward inclination and is\r\nthickly covered with dust.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the widest portion, which is near the end, Herbert\r\ndirected me to turn, so as to come down the jump-off feet first, where\r\nthere was a little difficulty in landing, as the perpendicular wall,\r\nwhich proved to be almost five feet high, offered only one projecting\r\nhelp, and that within a few inches of the base; but in obedience to his\r\nadvice to \"reach one foot a little farther down and then drop,\" I\r\nadvanced the right one, to be told not that, but the other, and was soon\r\ndown where it was possible to observe with interest that the right foot\r\nhad been swinging above an open fissure. We stood in a wide crevice\r\nrunning at right angles to the obnoxious passage we had just quit, and\r\nimmediately found a guide's mark on a large rock, and others followed at\r\nintervals of a few feet over extremely \"rough country\" as the guides\r\nsay. Everywhere the work of water was apparent, not in the crystal\r\ndeposits of still water as in other portions of the cave, but the\r\nerosion due to its rushing through. Carefully following the marks, they\r\nled into a cross-crevice that took us under Rainy Chamber, and ends\r\nthere by widening into a circular chamber of about fifty feet width in\r\neither direction, and rising to a height of nearly fifty feet in a fine\r\ndome. Down the wall from near the top of the dome there appears to flow\r\na beautiful waterfall showing a variety of colors in the straight lines,\r\nas if from refraction. The fall is, of course, dripstone, and I knew we\r\nhad found Niagara, although we had gone beyond the reach of the guide's\r\nvoice almost at the start. A huge rock directly under the dome has\r\nreceived the falling drip until it represents a mountain cataract. These\r\ndeposits testify to the great age of the chamber they adorn, as they\r\nwere necessarily not commenced until all heavy flow ceased, and in\r\nCrystal Cave the accumulation of dripstone is so slow that it is said\r\nsix years' observation can detect no increase whatever.\r\n\r\nSeveral small passages at the floor level gave exit to the great volume\r\nof water that evidently at one time entered this crevice, from Rainy\r\nChamber, by the route we followed, and being checked in its course the\r\nlower end of the crevice became filled, under pressure; and the low\r\nposition of the outlets gave this water a whirling motion that in time\r\nexcavated the dome-shaped room.\r\n\r\nNo part of Crystal Cave has ever been occupied by a river, but its\r\nfissures, opened by the violence of earth movements accompanying nearby\r\nvolcanic disturbances, have been filled more than once by the inrush of\r\nwaters which repeatedly submerged the whole Black Hills region.\r\n\r\nFollowing again the marks which guided us into Niagara Room, we soon\r\ncame within hailing distance of a voice expressive of profound relief;\r\nand as we crawled up the sloping passage, over-heated and breathless\r\nwith the exertion, the guide assured us he was most truly thankful to\r\nsee us again, as he had never in his life experienced so severe a scare\r\nas since it had occurred to him that we had gone beyond the limits of\r\ncommunication without a single match.\r\n\r\nHe also said I had been where no lady had ever gone before, and took\r\nsatisfaction in the fact that many men have refused to make the venture\r\nwith a guide.\r\n\r\nLeaving this portion of the cave, by returning as we came, through\r\nSuicide Room, Starr Chamber, and Senate Chamber, we crawled along the\r\nrocks overhanging a narrow fissure, to reach a ladder at the end, by\r\nwhich we descended to another part of the Catacombs. Here, after\r\ntraveling a long distance over uneven floors covered with sharp\r\ncrystals, as were all surfaces, through large, low rooms, and narrow,\r\ncrooked passages, constantly assisting the difficult advance with our\r\nhands, like monkeys, we finally came to The Grotto, which is probably\r\nthe most remarkable room in this very remarkable cave. It is a large\r\nroom, with much of the irregular ceiling so low that even the small\r\nnephew struck his head severely while turning to warn me, as he often\r\ndid, of threatening inequalities in the floor and light them with his\r\nown candle. The crystals here are exceptionally fine, being very sharp\r\nand of unusual size, besides many of them being double--that is, pointed\r\nat both ends. Through this beautiful ceiling there is a percolating drip\r\nadding stalactites to the crystal-points and piling stalagmites on the\r\ncrystal masses below, varying this with imitation cascades, mats of\r\nsmall flowers, and masses of pop-corn. Off to one side in a kind of\r\nrecess there is a depression in the crystal floor filled with clear,\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\nA glance at the time now showed us to be in danger of failure to meet\r\nthe train to town, and consequently, tired as we were after nine hours\r\nof rough travel and much climbing, it was necessary to make our way out\r\nwith more speed than comfort, and we found the weather turning very\r\ncold. The cave was carefully locked, preparations for the train\r\nhurriedly made, the house closed, and as we left it the train could be\r\nheard coming down the cañon, but we arrived at the station first, though\r\nbreathless, and a few minutes later were in Piedmont, too tired to\r\nproperly enjoy a hot venison supper.\r\n\r\nAs to the size of Crystal Cave, it is impossible to make any positive\r\nstatement; for as Mr. McBride, the proprietor, says, no survey has yet\r\nbeen made. Other persons said that thirty-six miles is the greatest\r\nclaim made for the combined length of all passages, and sixteen miles\r\nthe least, so it may be wise to accept the lesser number until a survey\r\nproves it wrong.\r\n\r\nThe box work in Crystal Cave is not of such great abundance as to demand\r\nspecial attention, but is very beautiful, and one variety deserves\r\nparticular mention. These boxes have been formed in dark red sandstone,\r\nand after being emptied of their original contents, have been completely\r\nfilled with colorless calcite crystals, and over this is spread an outer\r\nsurface of the same crystals tinted a brilliant flame color by red\r\npaint-clay having been taken in solution by the crystal forming waters.\r\nA specimen of this was a temptation too great to be resisted even in the\r\nowner's absence.\r\n\r\nSome of the box work is of such size that a single box may have a\r\ncapacity equal to that of a bushel measure, but it is less beautiful\r\nthan the smaller forms.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we left Piedmont, and having a desire for\r\ngreater personal knowledge of the Hills, took the same train which had\r\ntaken us to the cave, and traveled to its western terminus, Lead City.\r\nThe interesting scenery makes this a desirable trip for any one visiting\r\nthe Hills, but its beauty is chiefly massed at the ends, the middle\r\ndistance being over gradually rising ground, which is without a\r\ncounterpart of the rocky cañon left behind or more than a suggestion of\r\nthe high hills yet to come. The special charm of this portion was the\r\nmagnificent pine forest which covered it until three years ago, when it\r\nwas swept by a terrible fire, from which the settlers escaped with only\r\ntheir lives; and even that would have been impossible if the railroad\r\ncompany had not kept refuge trains waiting for them just ahead of the\r\nflames. The prominent geological feature here is the porphyry dikes,\r\nwhich are becoming more numerous and more prominent, and in many places\r\nresemble a conspicuous group near Harney Peak, called The Needles. These\r\ndykes are of special interest in connection with a study of the caves,\r\nsince they are probably of simultaneous origin.\r\n\r\nThe same volcanic movements that caused the violent upheaval of the\r\nwhole region, and thrust up molten masses through the strata to form a\r\ncentral core to the Hills, must also have rent the nearby regions with\r\nfissures through which probably much gas escaped, and having been\r\nfurther opened and then adorned, now demand our attention as caves of\r\nunique and curious beauty.\r\n\r\nThe approach to Lead is over the hill-tops with a magnificent distant\r\nview, and the first glimpses of that young city famous for having as a\r\ncenter the Homestake mine, the largest gold mine in the world, are\r\ncharming. It is situated far down in a valley among the high hills and\r\nspreads some distance up the surrounding slopes.\r\n\r\nThe works of the great mine are wonderful, and visitors welcome to\r\nexamine whatever they find interesting; any questions they wish to ask\r\nare graciously answered, although every one is busy. This is not a\r\nspecial favor to the exceptional few, but the courtesy shown to all.\r\nVisitors are also welcome to descend into the mine, but as an attendant\r\nis necessary on account of dangers to be avoided, a permit must be\r\nobtained at the office.\r\n\r\nSeveral other caves have been discovered in the Black Hills, the largest\r\nof which is the Davenport Cave at Sturgis. Very little exploration has\r\nyet been done in it, but indications are said to be that it will take\r\nrank among the large ones.\r\n\r\nAt Galena, a new mining town of golden promise, there is reported to be\r\nan Ice Cave, where ice forms at all seasons, and during the warm weather\r\nis a source of comfort and pleasure to the miners.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as train time for continuing the homeward journey\r\napproached, the snow storm which began gently early in the afternoon,\r\ngrew steadily more severe. A carriage to the depot was not to be had, as\r\nevery vehicle in town had gone to the funeral of an old-timer in the\r\nHills and the return delayed by the storm. The situation could not be\r\nregarded as a special pleasure, but cave hunters learn to accept\r\nwhatever is and be thankful for the general average. At the last moment,\r\nhowever, a team was driven up and permission given us to make use of it.\r\nIt proved to be the private conveyance of the hotel proprietor, and the\r\nyoung boy who accompanied us, his son.\r\n\r\nOur train was on time, and the ride through the Hills to their southern\r\nlimit, in the falling snow, was wonderfully beautiful; but the storm\r\ncontinued for many days and was one of the most severe on record.\r\n\r\nThose persons who have been so unfortunate as to permit themselves to\r\naccept a ready made opinion of dangers and roughness to be met with in\r\nthe more newly settled regions, might find a tour of the Hills doubly\r\ninteresting by making a supplementary study of \"The Living Age,\" which\r\ncannot be so correctly viewed from a distance as is sometimes supposed,\r\nsince the specimens exhibited are not always a true average of the\r\nstrata they are supposed to represent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a visit to the marvelous caverns of the Black Hills, much may be\r\nadded to the pleasure already enjoyed, through the explanatory activity\r\nof the Yellowstone National Park, where even the wonderful combinations\r\nof beauty and grandeur are by no means the full measure of attraction\r\nand charm. Here is found evidence to verify theories concerning the\r\ncaves, and those theories in turn contribute in no small degree to a\r\nsatisfactory understanding of the mysteries of geyser action. For\r\nscientific study the two regions should be taken together, since the\r\nnatural conditions are practically the same, and the chief difference\r\nlies in the stages of development; the present of the Park explaining\r\nthe recent past of the Hills, while the present of the Hills foretells\r\nthe future of the Park. It seems that Nature, with a full appreciation\r\nof the limits and restrictions binding our powers to penetrate certain\r\nsecrets of an intermittent force, has in this great western country\r\ncarefully prepared what might quite properly be termed a progressive\r\ncourse of study, wherein each locality makes plain a special point that\r\nsomewhere else appears obscure.\r\n\r\nAs has been said in the preceding chapters, the two great caves in the\r\nBlack Hills of South Dakota cannot be accounted for by the same methods\r\nas are recognized as being responsible for the slow excavation of the\r\nbest known caves of the United States. Although there is every\r\nindication that both these caves have been subject to the action of\r\nenormous volumes of water, there is equally positive evidence that\r\nneither was ever the scene of a flowing cave-river. The lowest levels in\r\nboth show the narrowest fissures and the heaviest deposits of crystal,\r\nby which we infer that the water was held in confinement here, while all\r\nthe higher passages or channels bear witness to the water's flow. But\r\nmany of these channels in Crystal Cave, or indeed we might say, most of\r\nthem, present an unmistakable record of the gauge of the water stage at\r\ndifferent periods. During the earlier time, when the volume of water and\r\nconsequent pressure were greatest, frictional motion must have been\r\nlimited to the main channel connecting with the vent, and the high gauge\r\nof water maintained a fairly uniform degree of heat near its surface. In\r\nconsequence of these conditions geyser action, probably, was constant,\r\nand chemical activity was such that great chambers were formed and then\r\ndecorated, as already described, with wonderful masses of crystal. As\r\nthe water gauge receded to lower levels the higher chambers became\r\nstorage basins for water and steam forced up by the pressure from below,\r\nand the time required for these to fill and accumulate sufficient\r\npressure to continue the ejectment, formed the periods between eruptions\r\nafter the geyser became intermittent. It was during this stage that the\r\nsharp crystals in many of the channels, now called passages, were worn\r\ndown to smooth surfaces; and later, when water occupied only the lowest\r\nlevel, and the great geyser had become reduced to merely a steam vent,\r\nthe channels immediately connecting with that level were in their turn\r\nsubjected to the same smoothing process, and then all action ceased.\r\n\r\nAs no two of the glorious geysers of the Yellowstone Park are alike,\r\nneither do the two great caves of the Hills indicate that they should be\r\nso. The vent-tubing of each is quite unlike that of the other in all the\r\nessential governing points of length, size, shape, angle of inclination\r\nand power-conserving bends. And the differences extend in an almost\r\nequally marked degree throughout the vast and complicated succession of\r\nstorage chambers and their connecting channels. The small vent of Wind\r\nCave shows that the ejected jet was far from being equal to that of the\r\nCrystal Cave in volume; but the nearly perpendicular long arm of its\r\ntube shows also that its jet attained a much greater height, even\r\nsupposing that it should be necessary to make some allowance for a short\r\nelbow at the top.\r\n\r\nDr. Hayden's geological party gave much attention to the Yellowstone\r\nPark while its wonders were new to the world, and observations were made\r\nat various times during the period included between the years 1869 and\r\n1870. The special study, and full report of the geysers became the duty\r\nof Dr. A.C. Peal, whose descriptions and conclusions were published in\r\nU.S. Geological Survey Report, 1878, Part II. In the final pages of his\r\nreport he quotes the leading authorities on geyser action, and applies\r\nthe principles of their theories, according to his own judgment, to the\r\ngeysers of the park. Since copies of this report are not now easily\r\nobtained, nor even always accessible to the increasing number of\r\npersonages who visit the park, it may be well to quote from him some of\r\nthe theories he discussed and the opinions he expressed. On page 416,\r\nbeginning the chapter with the derivation of the word geyser from the\r\nIcelandic word _geysa_--to gush, he continues:\r\n\r\n\"We now come to the definition of a geyser. It may be defined to be a\r\nperiodically eruptive or intermittent _hot_ spring, from which the water\r\nis projected into the air in a fountain-like column. The analogy between\r\ngeysers and volcanoes has frequently been noticed and the former have\r\noften been described as volcanoes which erupt heated water instead of\r\nmelted lava. We have italicized the word hot in the definition just\r\ngiven, because springs containing a large amount of gas may simulate\r\ngeysers.\r\n\r\n\"The difference between geysers and ordinary hot springs is not readily\r\nexplained, nor even always recognized. The difference between a quiet\r\nthermal spring and a geyser in active eruption is very marked, but\r\nbetween the two there is every grade of action. Some geysers appear as\r\nquiet springs, as for instance the Grand Geyser during its period of\r\nquiescence. Others might easily be mistaken for constantly boiling\r\nsprings, as in the case of the Giant Geyser, in which the water is\r\nconstantly in active ebullition. This is true also of the Strockr of\r\nIceland. Many of the springs, therefore, that in the Yellowstone Park\r\nhave been classed as constantly boiling springs may be unsuspected\r\ngeysers. The Excelsior Geyser was not discovered to be a geyser until\r\neight years after the setting aside of the park. Almost all constantly\r\nboiling springs have periods of increased activity, and those which\r\nspurt a few feet into the air have been classed as pseudo-geysers.\r\n\r\n\"It has been noticed that geysers occur where the intensity of volcanic\r\naction is decreasing. In the neighborhood of active volcanoes, such as\r\nVesuvius, the temperature appears to be too high, and the vapor escapes\r\nas steam from what are called stufas. When the rocks at the surface are\r\nmore cooled the water comes forth in liquid form.\r\n\r\n\"We will now pass to the various geyser theories that have been proposed\r\nby different writers.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Peal then proceeds to give the theories of Sir J. Herschell and Sir\r\nGeorge McKenzie, but as they are accepted and extended by others, we may\r\npass on to Bischof's, of which Dr. Peal says: \"Very similar to\r\nMcKenzie's theory is the one adopted by Bischof in his Researches on the\r\nInternal Heat of the Globe (pages 227, 228). It is really the theory of\r\nKrug Von Nidda, who examined the geyser in 1833. Bischof says:\r\n\r\n\"'He (Krug Von Nidda) takes it for granted that these hot springs derive\r\ntheir temperature from the aqueous vapors rising from below. When these\r\nvapors are able to rise freely in a continued column the water at the\r\ndifferent depths must have a constant temperature equal to that at which\r\nwater would boil under the pressure existing at the respective depths;\r\nhence the constant ebullition of the permanent springs and their boiling\r\nheat. If, on the other hand, the vapors be prevented by the complicated\r\nwindings of its channels from rising to the surface; if, for example,\r\nthey be arrested in caverns, the temperature in the upper layers of\r\nwater must necessarily become reduced, because a large quantity of it is\r\nlost by evaporation at the surface, which cannot be replaced from below.\r\nAnd any circulation of the layers of water at different temperatures, by\r\nreason of their unequal specific gravities, seems to be very much\r\ninterrupted by the narrowness and sinuousity of the passage. The\r\nintermitting springs of Iceland are probably caused by the existence of\r\ncaverns, in which the vapor is retained by the pressure of the column of\r\nwater in the channel which leads to the surface. Here this vapor\r\ncollects, and presses the water in the cavern downward until its elastic\r\nforce becomes sufficiently great to effect a passage through the column\r\nof water which confines it. The violent escape of the vapor causes the\r\nthunder-like subterranean sound and the trembling of the earth which\r\nprecedes each eruption. The vapors do not appear at the surface until\r\nthey have heated the water to their own temperature.\r\n\r\n\"'When so much vapor has escaped that the expansive force of that which\r\nremains has become less than the pressure of the confining column of\r\nwater, tranquility is restored, and this lasts until such a quantity of\r\nvapor is again collected as to produce a fresh eruption. The spouting of\r\nthe spring is therefore repeated at intervals, depending on the\r\ncapacity of the cavern, the height of the column of water, and the heat\r\ngenerated below.'\" Dr. Peal continues:\r\n\r\n\"Bishof says that the eruptions of the Geyser and Strockr agree exactly\r\nwith this explanation and he accounts for the two distinct classes of\r\neruption observed in the Geyser as follows:\r\n\r\n\"'The two distinct classes of eruption in the geyser which we have\r\nalready mentioned seem to be attributable to two different cavities. A\r\nsmall cavity fills quicker, and, therefore, empties itself more\r\nfrequently; a larger one fills slower, empties itself seldomer, but with\r\ngreater violence.'\"\r\n\r\nBunsen's theory is the next considered and is somewhat similar to\r\nBischof's but with notable differences. After taking temperatures at\r\ndifferent points in the Geyser tube his first conclusions are that:\r\n\r\n(1) The temperature in the geyser tube increases as we descend.\r\n\r\n(2) At no point does the water in the tube attain the temperature of\r\nebullition which it should have under the pressure to which it is\r\nsubjected, but the temperature depends on the time that has elapsed\r\nsince the last eruption. As a great eruption comes near it approaches\r\nthe boiling point.\r\n\r\n(3) At the depth of about forty-five feet the difference between the\r\ntemperature of the water and the calculated boiling point for that\r\npressure is the least.\r\n\r\nThe main point of his theory appears to be that an eruption takes place\r\nwhen the water in the tube reaches the boiling point, and to account for\r\nit, \"He supposes that the column in the central tube communicates by a\r\nlong and sinuous channel with some space, be it what it may, which is\r\nsubjected to the action of the direct source of subterranean heat. The\r\ntemperature gets raised above the boiling point, due to the pressure,\r\nand a sudden generation of steam is the result. This steam rises in the\r\ncolumn of water, which, being cooler, causes it to condense. Gradually\r\nthe heat of the water is raised until the water of the channel must\r\nboil, and the steam therefore cannot condense, but must accumulate and\r\nacquire a gradually increasing tension. The condensation of the bubbles\r\npossesses a periodic character, and to this is due the uplifting of the\r\nwater in what Bunsen calls conical water hills, which are accompanied by\r\nthe subterranean explosions.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Comstock is quoted as thinking \"Bunsen's theory has not yet been\r\nproved adequate to explain the more prominent features of geyser\r\neruptions. Nor does it, in his opinion, account for all the differences\r\nbetween geysers and hot springs, and he proposes a structural\r\nhypothesis which combines Bischof's and Bunsen's theories.\"\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is illustrated by a figure in which a reservoir partly\r\nfilled with water is connected with the surface by a tube having a\r\ndouble curve, and he explains that the water collecting in the depressed\r\ncurve should confine the steam, rising from the reservoir in the other\r\ncurve until the pressure is sufficient to cause an eruption. His theory\r\nof action being that the water in the reservoir remains in equilibrium\r\nat a certain level, and the constant heat fills the space above with\r\nvapor, which heats the water held in the downward bend of the tube, and\r\nthat also evolves vapor which fills the balance of the tube to the vent.\r\nWhen the combined pressure of this vapor and water are overcome by the\r\nexpansion of vapor accumulated above the reservoir, they are forced out,\r\nand followed by a portion of the water of the reservoir. This theory is\r\nin the report of Captain Jones on Northwestern Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe last theory cited by Dr. Peal is that of S. Baring-Gould, \"Who\r\nvisited the Iceland geysers in 1863, and thinks that a bent tube is\r\nsufficient to explain the action of the Great Geyser. He took an iron\r\ntube and bent it in an angle of 110°, keeping one arm half the length of\r\nthe other. He filled the tube with water and placed the short arm in the\r\nfire. For a moment the surface of the liquid remained quiet, and then\r\nthe pipe began to quiver; a slight overflow took place, without any sign\r\nof ebullition, and then suddenly, with a throb, the whole column was\r\nforced high into the air. With a tube, the long arm of which measured\r\ntwo feet and the bore of which was three-eighths of an inch, he sent a\r\njet to the height of eighteen feet. Steam is generated in the short arm\r\nand presses down the water, causing an overflow until the steam bubble\r\nturns the angle, when it forces out the column in the long arm with\r\nincredible violence.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Peal now goes on to say:\r\n\r\n\"Of the theories that we have just enumerated, perhaps no one is\r\nadequate to explain all the phenomena of geyser action. Bunsen's theory\r\ncomes nearest to it, and in the simplest kinds of geysers is a\r\nsufficient explanation. The variations and modifications in the geyser\r\ntubes and subterranean water passages must undoubtedly be important\r\nfactors entering into any complete explanation of geyser action. Now, of\r\ncourse, we can see what the conditions are at the surface, but in our\r\nexperiments we can penetrate to a very inconsiderable distance. We have,\r\ntherefore, no data to present on these points, and investigations of\r\nthis branch of the subject will have to be carried on in an artificial\r\nmanner; that is artificial geysers will have to be constructed, and\r\nvarious modifications made in the tubes until results are reached\r\nanalogous to those seen in natural geysers. If water in a glass tube be\r\nheated with rapidity from the bottom, it will be expelled from the tube\r\nviolently, and if boiled in a kettle which has a lid and a spout, either\r\nthe lid will be blown off or the water will be forced out through the\r\nspout. The first case is an illustration, in part at least, of Bunsen's\r\ntheory, and the second exemplifies the theories which presuppose the\r\nexistence of subterranean cavities with tubes at or near the surface.\r\nAccording to the former we must suppose that the layer of rock,\r\nextending seventy-five to seventy-seven feet below the surface, contains\r\nsufficient heat to account for geyseric phenomena; or else that the\r\ngeyser tube has some opening, either at the bottom or on the sides, by\r\nwhich steam and superheated water have access to it from a considerably\r\ngreater depth where the temperature is very high. At these depths\r\ncaverns probably exist.\" * * * *\r\n\r\n\"That such cavities exist is more than probable. On page 405 I have\r\nindicated my belief, that all geysers are originally due to a violent\r\noutburst of steam and water, and under such conditions, irregular\r\ncavities and passages are more likely to be formed than regular\r\ntubes.\" * *\r\n\r\n\"In view of what we have just written, Bunsen's conclusion (No. 2)\r\nwould have to be modified somewhat. His conclusion was that at no point\r\nin the tube did the water attain the temperature of ebullition which it\r\nshould have under the pressure to which it is subjected. As far as this\r\nrelates to the straight tube in which his temperatures were taken, it\r\nmay be so; but if he could have taken temperatures in the side conduit,\r\nI have little doubt he would soon have reached a point where the\r\ntemperature would not only be at the boiling point for that depth but\r\neven exceed it. In the Yellowstone Park we obtained a number of surface\r\ntemperatures which were above the boiling point. In the Great Geyser of\r\nIceland, the mass of water in the tube prevents this condition at the\r\nsurface, and when it takes place opposite the aperture an eruption is\r\ncaused. In the main, however, I am inclined to accept Bunsen's theory,\r\nespecially as it seems to me to require subterranean cavities in which\r\nthe water must be heated. Whether these are caverns, enlargements of\r\ntubes, or sinus channels, appears to me to be of no consequence, except\r\nas the interval or period of the geyser might be affected by the form of\r\nthe reservoir holding the water.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Peal has reached conclusions which present an imaginary picture of\r\nthe interior structure of the great geysers of the Park, that bears a\r\nstriking resemblance to what the two caves of the Black Hills prove to\r\nbe the true conditions; although it is evident he had in mind caverns of\r\nno such vast extent, nor of so complicated a system of cavities and\r\ntubes. He overlooked an important feature, however, in not accepting\r\nProfessor Comstock's idea of the tube having a double curve. The double\r\ncurve is, or was, conspicuous in both the caves. Unfortunately, its\r\nperfection in Wind Cave was necessarily partially sacrificed to make the\r\npassage traversable for visitors; but in describing the enormous labor\r\nof opening up the cave, Mr. McDonald showed how an arching \"crawl\" had\r\nbeen worked down by blasting, and the depression beyond filled to raise\r\nit to the desired level for securing the present easy passage at the\r\nbottom of the main tube, which is the entrance passage. This double\r\ncurve in the tube is simply the rough original of the S trap of sanitary\r\nplumbing. In both caves it is somewhat irregular and deformed, but the\r\nfamiliar \"trap\" is easily recognized. The destruction of one of the\r\nYellowstone geysers was, no doubt, due to the breaking of the S. One of\r\nthe many reasons for establishing military control over the Park is said\r\nto have been the disastrous results following the introduction of a\r\nlarge quantity of soap into the geyser to cause a premature eruption.\r\nThe impatience of the party was rewarded by an eruption accompanied by\r\nexplosions that shook the earth for a great distance, and the geyser has\r\nnot been seen in action since.\r\n\r\nDr. Peal finds the theories advanced for the generation of steam\r\nunsatisfactory and insufficient, especially in the class of geysers\r\nhaving a long steam period. He says: (page 423)\r\n\r\n\"The Castle Geyser differs from Old Faithful and the Bee Hive mainly in\r\nthe fact that it has a long steam period, during which the steam pours\r\nout or is pushed from the geyser throat with great violence and a\r\nterrific noise. There appear to be only two possible explanations of\r\nthis difference, viz., either an accumulation of immense volumes of\r\nsteam in the Castle, or an instantaneous formation of steam throughout\r\nthe length of the geyser tube. The former, to our mind, is untenable,\r\nbecause it seems impossible that the water, which is exhausted in\r\nfifteen minutes, should exert enough power to keep down the immense\r\namount of steam that escapes for more than an hour. According to\r\nBunsen's theory, it can be readily explained. The relief afforded by the\r\nfirst part of the eruptions allows the superheated water to rise\r\nrapidly, and before it can reach the top or orifice of the tube it is\r\nall converted into steam from the top downward with inconceivable\r\nrapidity, and must be forced out with the terrific violence which is\r\nnoted in the case of the Castle. On page 208 we have expressed the\r\nopinion that it is the oldest geyser in the region, and it seems to us\r\nthat a greater length in the tube, with a consequent greater supply of\r\nwater, will account for the difference between the Castle and Old\r\nFaithful, the latter of which we consider one of the youngest geysers in\r\nthe Upper Geyser Basin.\"\r\n\r\nA study of the Caves in connection with the active Geysers indicates\r\nthat the theory he suggests and then rejects, is probably the true\r\nexplanation of the difference between the two kinds of geysers. It seems\r\nthat the length of the tube must necessarily have more effect on the\r\nheight of the jet than on the generation of steam; as after an eruption\r\nthe tube is hotter than at any other time and therefore the generation\r\nof steam in it should be less than usual, unless the fresh inflow of\r\nwater was cold. Then if the storage cavities are broad but low, the\r\nsteam cannot accumulate above the water; but when the pressure becomes\r\nsufficient to force a passage through the tube, the water and steam are\r\nexpelled together until the pressure is exhausted. But if the storage\r\nchambers are vertical fissures, as Wind Cave illustrates, vast\r\nquantities of steam must accumulate above the water level in the main\r\nreservoirs before the pressure can become sufficient to expel the water\r\nin the tube, after which steam alone continues to rush out until the\r\npressure is so relieved that it can no longer force a passage through\r\nthe water remaining in the trap, when quiet is restored. By the constant\r\naddition of fresh water from the surface, by percolation or other usual\r\nways of sinking, the necessary conditions for the generation of steam\r\nare maintained with surprising regularity.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the shape and general arrangement of the cavities and\r\ntubes of the two caves, indicate that their action as geysers was very\r\nunlike. Wind Cave evidently sent a rather slender column to a great\r\nheight, nearly perpendicular, and the water eruption was followed by a\r\nlong steam period. Crystal Cave ejected a much larger jet more\r\nfrequently, at a low angle of inclination, the eruption was sooner over,\r\nand was not followed by a steam period of any consequence.\r\n\r\nThus it can be seen that the caves of the Black Hills prove the theories\r\nin regard to geyser action in Yellowstone Park, and those theories, in\r\nturn, prove the past history of the caves. The study of geyser action\r\nalso shows that the conical or dome shape of some of the cave chambers\r\nis not due to the whirl of incoming floods, as in other regions, but to\r\njets of water forced up from lower levels.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the finest geyser basin, and possible cave, ever in existence\r\nwas destroyed when the Grand Cañon of the Yellowstone became a cañon.\r\nEvidences of the former conditions in control of this gorgeously\r\nbrilliant scene are neither wanting nor doubtful. Steam constantly\r\nissues from numerous small vents in the cañon walls, and a field glass\r\nreveals miniature geysers in action down in the depth of the cañon,\r\nnearly half a mile below the top of the wall; while the entire cañon\r\nshows, in both the color and character of its rocks, that chemical\r\nagencies have wrought changes here that have not been effected in other\r\nexposures of similar nature. It seems not improbable that the relation\r\nof Yellowstone River to the Grand Cañon was the same as, at the present\r\ntime, is that of the Firehole to the Upper, Middle, and Lower Geyser\r\nBasins: and that an explosion of great force was followed by a general\r\ncollapse instead of the usual eruption of one of the grandest geysers;\r\none result being the sudden precipitation of the river into a new,\r\nbeautiful, and totally unexpected channel. After its great leap of two\r\nhundred and ninety-seven[6] feet at the Lower Fall, the river flows in a\r\nbrilliant, narrow line of emerald green, broken by the white foam of\r\nfrequent cascades, between magnificent walls of yellow, white, pink, and\r\nred of most vivid hues.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] Measurement by the Hayden Party.",
