Fossils are undoubtedly historic medallions of remote\r\nperiods in the natural history of our earth, and our design is, merely\r\nto illustrate with them a neglected department of ancient zoology, by\r\ndescribing a few which have recently fallen under our own observation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nothing can be more opposed to true science, than to\r\npronounce on the priority of formation, or the comparative age of\r\nrocks, from either their structure, or the organic remains they\r\npresent. M. Alexandre Brongniart thus propounds his opinion: \"In those\r\ncases where characters derived from the nature of the rocks are opposed\r\nto those which we derive from organic remains, I should give the\r\npreponderance to the latter.\" This seems to us to imply an admission,\r\nthat nothing definite can be inferred from the _nature of the rocks_;\r\nmoreover, that between the nature of the rock, and the organic remains,\r\nthere may be a palpable discrepancy; and that these may be even at\r\ncomplete antipodes with each other. The event has proved, from what we\r\nhave already mentioned, that no evidence as to priority can be obtained\r\nfrom the nature of the fossil remains displayed in particular strata.\r\nIn addition to what has been said on this subject, we may further\r\nstate, that _encrinites_, _entrochites_, and _pentacrinites_ are found\r\nin clay slate, grauwacke, transition limestone, alpine limestone,\r\nlias, muschelkalk, and chalk. It may be reasonably asked how these\r\nthree species of fossils could indicate any particular formation, when\r\nthey are found in so many types and structures of rocks altogether\r\ndifferent? If they would go to prove any thing at all, it would be that\r\nof a _contemporaneous_ formation; but certainly not distinct epochas.\r\n_See Eclectic Review, July, 1832._]\r\n\r\nIn some varieties of rocks there is often found the fossil remains of\r\nan animal which bears some resemblance to certain species of the crab.\r\nThe back of this organic relic is commonly divided by two deep grooves\r\nor furrows, into three longitudinal lobes, and from this circumstance,\r\nthe term _Trilobite_ has been applied as a family name to distinguish\r\nthis whole race of beings. This general appellation, however, though in\r\nmost of the species, highly appropriate, is by no means applicable to\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe individuals which compose the family of the trilobites resemble\r\neach other in many important particulars, and form together an\r\nexceedingly natural group. The body, with but few exceptions, is\r\ndivided transversely into three parts. The anterior portion or head\r\noften resembles the buckler of the _horse foot_ or _king crab_\r\n(_limulus polyphemus_), so common on our sea coast. The middle portion\r\nis the _abdomen_, and is always separated transversely into a number\r\nof segments or articulations, generally diminishing in breadth as they\r\nrecede from the head. The posterior end is the _tail_, which, though\r\nin some species, a mere prolongation of the abdomen, that can scarcely\r\nbe distinguished from it, yet in others it assumes a genuine caudal\r\nappendage.\r\n\r\nThe head of the trilobite is also generally divided into three parts:\r\nthe middle is called the _front_, or forehead; and the lateral portions\r\nthe _cheeks_. In most cases, a projecting tubercle, or knob, is\r\nobservable on the anterior surface of each cheek, which has much the\r\nappearance of an eye. Its reticulated structure is in many instances so\r\nanalogous to that of the eyes of some crustaceous animals, and also of\r\nsome species of insects, that there can be but little doubt that these\r\ntubercular projections, were true organs of vision.\r\n\r\nSome of the genera which belong to this remarkable race of fossil\r\nanimals, possessed the power of rolling or coiling themselves up into a\r\nkind of ball, like certain species of insects, or like the armadillo;\r\nand they are always found embedded in the rocks in this attitude.\r\n\r\nSuch are the general characters by which these petrifactions may be\r\nknown, and they will be found illustrated in a manner more or less\r\nstriking, in most of the species. The exceptions, which rarely occur,\r\nwill be distinctly marked, when the species are described.\r\n\r\nThe superior covering, or upper shell of the trilobite is the only part\r\nof the animal, concerning which we have any satisfactory knowledge.\r\nIt is conjectured that it was furnished with articulated feet, but no\r\ntraces of any organs of progressive motion have hitherto been fairly\r\ndiscovered.[2] Hence, it may be reasonably supposed, that the structure\r\nof the lower portions of the animal were so soft and delicate, as to\r\nrender them incapable of sustaining the process of mineralization,\r\nwhich the hard crustaceous covering of the back so successfully\r\nundergoes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. Parkinson states, that in a trilobite which he\r\npossessed he thought he perceived the _points_ of the feet; but on\r\nendeavouring to detach the piece of rock in which it was embedded, the\r\nspecimen was entirely shivered, though he worked at it with the utmost\r\ncare. A portion of the underside of a trilobite (_Isotelus gigas_)\r\nnear the anterior edge of the head, was distinctly ascertained, by Dr.\r\nDekay, but only enough to convince him of its analogy in this part with\r\nthat of the limulus polyphemus no organs of locomotion could be seen.\r\nMr. Stokes, the distinguished fossilist of London, has confirmed the\r\nobservation of Dr. Dekay, by some dissections of his own.]\r\n\r\nThat these petrifactions were once marine animals there can be little\r\ndoubt, for they are always found associated in the same rocks with\r\nshells, and other productions peculiar to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe Trilobite is supposed by many naturalists to be one of the first\r\nanimated beings of our earth called into existence by the great Author\r\nof nature.[3] It was first noticed more than two centuries ago, among\r\nthe petrifactions which abound in a calcareous rock, at Dudley, in\r\nEngland, and was from this circumstance, called for a long time, the\r\n_Dudley fossil_. Linné gave it the name of the _Paradoxical insect_;\r\nbut whether an insect, a crustaceous animal, or a shell, is still\r\nconsidered by many as problematical.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It is obvious, that if most of the gelatinous animals\r\nwhich now inhabit our seas, were to become extinct, few or no traces\r\nof them could be found in any succeeding depositions of earthy matter.\r\nWhatever kind of animal life, therefore, may have been the first which\r\nappeared in our planet, must be entirely hypothetical. All that we\r\ncan with certainty say of it, is, that it was best adapted to the\r\ncircumstances, in which it was to exist, and that it was consistent\r\nwith the wisdom and design which we see every where pervading the\r\nuniverse.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high antiquity of the family of the Trilobites,\r\nand the remarkable characters the different individuals which compose\r\nit, sustain in the animal kingdom; till within a very few years, the\r\nwhole race has been almost entirely neglected by naturalists. The\r\nfirst attempt at any systematic arrangement of the genera and species,\r\nwas made in 1815, by Alexander Brongniart, Professor of Mineralogy,\r\n&c. &c., in Paris.[4] Until that period, the term _Entomolithus\r\nParadoxus_, proposed by Linné, was applied to all the fossil remains,\r\nwhich in their general appearance bore any resemblance to that found at\r\nDudley, and which he first described under that name. The confusion,\r\ntherefore, which existed in this department of natural science, may\r\nreadily be imagined; especially, as the species rapidly multiplied,\r\nwhen they were supposed to throw some rays of light on certain\r\nobscure geological phenomena. Soon after the appearance of Professor\r\nBrongniart's excellent work, the attention of other naturalists was\r\ndirected to this neglected part of creation. The most important memoir,\r\non account of the number of species, well figured and described in\r\nit, is one by Dr. E. W. Dalmann, published in the Transactions of the\r\nSwedish Academy, for 1826. There is also in the Acts of the Royal\r\nSociety, at Upsal, an excellent paper on this subject by Professor\r\nWahlenberg. Our highly esteemed friend, Dr. James E. Dekay, has also\r\ngiven in the first volume of the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural\r\nHistory of New York, some very interesting and ingenious observations\r\non the nature and the structure of the Trilobites, with a description\r\nof a new genus. These are the principal authorities which have been\r\nconsulted in arranging the present work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: I cannot let this opportunity pass, without acknowledging\r\nmy obligations to Professor Brongniart, for his civilities, when on a\r\nlate visit to Paris. Every one whose curiosity leads him to examine the\r\nroyal manufactory of porcelain, at Sevres, of which he is the director,\r\nwill no doubt acknowledge that his talents as a philosopher, are\r\nrivalled by his accomplishments as a gentleman.]\r\n\r\nOur object in the present undertaking being merely to give a monograph\r\nof the species of Trilobites found in the rocks of North America; we\r\nleave to other and abler hands the more difficult and interesting task\r\nof determining with precision the connexion which may exist between\r\nthese organic reliques, and the relative ages of the strata in which\r\nthey are found.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed, indeed, that a sufficient number of well characterized\r\nspecies have not yet been collected and accurately described, to throw\r\nany certain and clear light on otherwise doubtful geological phenomena.\r\nWhat has been remarked by De Candolle, with regard to botanical\r\ngeography, is perhaps true of these fossils as to solving the difficult\r\nproblems of geology--\"Let us not forget,\" says he, \"that this science\r\ncan only be commenced when the study of _species_ has been sufficiently\r\nadvanced to furnish us with numerous and well authenticated facts.\"\r\n\r\nWe are well aware of the difficulty of settling the line which ought\r\nto divide species. Individuals perfectly identical in all their\r\nparts, are rarely, if ever seen; though a general resemblance may be\r\neasily traced. Among fossils, just discriminations of this kind are\r\nmore delicate, than in recent specimens. The hand of time, accidental\r\ncauses, and the influence of atmospheric changes often produce such\r\ncharacters as to render the determination of fossil species an\r\nexceedingly difficult task. We have no doubt, therefore, that a few of\r\nour Trilobites, which are now considered as perfectly identical with\r\nsome found in Europe, will upon fuller examination, be discovered to be\r\ndissimilar, and of course certain geological speculations grounded on\r\nthe first opinion, be ultimately abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of organic remains, is an exceedingly\r\ncurious inquiry. If accurately pursued, without reference to any\r\npreconceived theory, it will no doubt furnish much information as to\r\nthe comparative ages of the different strata which compose the external\r\ncrust of our planet--for that these strata were deposited or formed at\r\nperiods of time more or less remote from each other, every one knows,\r\nto be a generally admitted _geological fact_. The occurrence of similar\r\nfossils in districts of country remotely situated from each other,\r\ncertainly presents a phenomenon highly interesting to the speculative\r\nnaturalist, and apparently indicates that the same powerful and general\r\ncauses must have concurred to produce these isomorphous depositions. No\r\nfossils have contributed more to this kind of information, than those\r\nof shells, and as the mineralized species could not be satisfactorily\r\nstudied, except by accurately comparing them with those which now\r\ninhabit our seas and continents; the search for shells, has become,\r\nfrom a simple amusement, the study of scientific men--or, as a writer\r\nremarks, \"it was only after the period when it was perceived that\r\ngeology and ancient zoology were destined to be enlightened by their\r\nfossil remains, that this research passed from the hands of amateurs\r\ninto those of naturalists.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: We have not unfrequently noticed, both in the writings\r\nand conversation of some geologists, a disposition to sneer at the\r\nsubsidiary branches of natural history. Mineralogy and conchology, are\r\nlight and mean in their estimation, when compared with the study of\r\nextensive strata and ponderous boulders. Like Irving's testy governor\r\nof Manahatta, who settled the accounts of his clients by placing their\r\nbooks in the opposite scales of a balance, they decide on the value\r\nof a science, by the absolute weight of the objects embraced by it.\r\nGeology, as well as any other branch of natural history, may degenerate\r\ninto a mere love for the curious, or have for its principal aim, the\r\nperfection or improvement of some ideal system of classification,\r\nwithout advancing a single step further.]\r\n\r\nAnother curious _geological fact_ appears to be established more\r\nespecially by fossil trilobites; it is that precisely the same species\r\nof animal relic, is the most generally diffused over the globe, in\r\nproportion to the antiquity of the rock which contains it. Thus the\r\ntransition limestone of England, France, Germany and Sweden, contains\r\nthe species called the Calymene of Blumenbach, in common with the same\r\nformation which extends over so large a portion of the United States.\r\n\r\nDifferent genera and species of the trilobite are now found in almost\r\nevery part of the globe, and are frequently exceedingly abundant in the\r\nrocks which contain them. That they must have swarmed in particular\r\nplaces, is abundantly evident from a number of localities in our own\r\ncountry,--millions, for example, must have lived and died not far\r\nfrom Trenton falls, in the State of New York. There are very few of\r\nthe numerous visiters to that romantic cascade, whose curiosity is\r\nnot awaked, by the multitude of these petrified beings, seemingly of\r\nanother world, which are there entombed.\r\n\r\nAlthough many parts of the trilobite are now found distributed through\r\nthe rocks which contain them, in such a manner as to lead to the\r\nconclusion, that they were separated by decomposition, after the death\r\nof the animal; yet the perfect preservation of others, and the rolled\r\nand disjointed attitudes which we should expect such creatures to\r\nassume when disturbed, lead to the conjecture, that they have been\r\noften suddenly destroyed, and as suddenly enveloped in that earthy\r\nmatter, which afterwards became an indurated rock; thus preventing the\r\nseparation of the harder parts, by the slow process of decomposition.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Vide De la Beche's Geological Manual.]\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of the trilobite family, are supposed by most\r\nnaturalists to belong to a race of beings now extinct; but from the\r\nstrong analogy which exists between them and certain species of\r\ncrustaceous animals now living, it is highly probable that they will\r\nyet be found alive. This opinion will not be regarded as visionary,\r\nwhen it is recollected how large a portion of the surface of the earth\r\nis still unexplored by its enlightened and civilized inhabitants--how\r\nsmall the number of animated beings are yet known to the scientific\r\nworld--and above all the fact, that many animals as confidently\r\ndeclared to be peculiar to a former world, are now found to be among\r\nthe creatures at present in existence. This opinion, we think, is\r\nquite as plausible, and far more interesting, than the blank and\r\nunsatisfactory hypothesis that all the trilobites are confined to an\r\norder of things before the present glorious creation.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The incorrectness of the inference that all the genera\r\nand species of fossil animals found in the transition rocks must be\r\nnow extinct, will appear from the following extract from Bakewell's\r\nGeology:--\"The _Madrepora stylina_, so common in transition lime-stone\r\nrock, is entirely wanting in the secondary and tertiary strata, but a\r\nliving animal of this species has been recently discovered in the South\r\nSeas. The Pentacrinus makes its first distinct appearance in the lias;\r\nbut is not frequently met with in the upper strata, and disappears\r\nentirely in the uppermost formations: hence it was long supposed\r\nthat the species was extinct. A living Pentacrinus has recently been\r\ndiscovered in the West Indies, and its stem and branches in a perfect\r\nstate have been sent to this country.\" (England.) In the Museum at\r\nAlbany, N. Y., I have examined a recent Pentacrinus, which I conclude,\r\ncame from the West Indies, from the proprietor's account of the manner\r\nin which he obtained it. It has been a very perfect specimen but the\r\nbranches are gradually dropping off.]\r\n\r\nThere appears to have been known to naturalists, when the improved\r\nedition of Prof. Brongniart's work on the trilobites appeared in 1822,\r\nbut 17 well marked species, and out of which he constructed the five\r\nfollowing genera, which he thus characterizes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus First._ Calymene.\r\n\r\n_Body_ capable of contraction into nearly a semicylindrical sphere.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_ with many tubercles or folds. Two reticulated eye-shaped\r\ntubercles.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen and Post-abdomen_ with entire edges. Abdomen divided by 12 or\r\n14 articulations.\r\n\r\nNo elongated tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Second._ Asaphus.\r\n\r\n_Body_ broad and rather flat. Middle lobe prominent and very distinct.\r\n\r\n_Flanks or lateral lobes_ each double the size of the middle lobe.\r\n\r\n_Submembranaceous expansions_ extending beyond the lateral lobes.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_ semicircular, with two reticulated eye-shaped tubercles.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ divided into 8 or 12 articulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Third._ Ogygia.\r\n\r\n_Body_ much depressed into an oblong ellipsis not contractile into a\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_ edged, a slight longitudinal furrow arising from its anterior\r\nextremity. Posterior angles elongated into points.\r\n\r\n_Without any tubercles_ except the eyes, which are neither prominent\r\nnor reticulated.\r\n\r\n_Longitudinal lobes_ slightly prominent.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ with 8 articulations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Fourth._ Paradoxides.\r\n\r\n_Body_ depressed not contractile.\r\n\r\n_Flanks_ much broader than the middle lobe.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_ nearly semicircular three transverse furrows on the middle\r\nlobe.\r\n\r\n_Eye-shaped tubercles_ none.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ with 12 articulations.\r\n\r\n_Arches_ of the lateral lobes, more or less prolonged beyond the\r\nmembrane which sustains them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Fifth._ Agnostus.\r\n\r\n_Body_ ellipsoidal--semicylindrical.\r\n\r\n_Buckler and flanks_ edged--the edges being slightly elevated.\r\n\r\n_Middle lobe_ with two transverse divisions, each composed of a single\r\npiece.\r\n\r\n_Two glandular_ tubercles on the anterior part of the body.\r\n\r\nIn 1824, Dr. J. E. Dekay added a sixth genus to the family of the\r\ntrilobites, which he describes in the following manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Sixth._ Isotelus.\r\n\r\n_Body_ oval oblong, often contracted, not unfrequently extended.\r\n\r\n_Head_ or _buckler_ large and rounded, equalling the tail in size, with\r\nbut two oculiform tubercles.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ with 8 articulations.\r\n\r\nFrontal process beneath, with two semilunar terminations.\r\n\r\n_Post-abdomen_ or _tail_ broad, expanded with indistinct divisions, as\r\nlarge as the buckler.\r\n\r\n_Longitudinal_ lobes very distinct.\r\n\r\nThis genus, he remarks, will be sufficiently distinguished from the\r\nfive genera proposed by _M. Alexandre Brongniart_ in his valuable and\r\ntruly philosophical work on the trilobites by the following particulars.\r\n\r\nFrom _Calymene_. By the presence of but two tubercles on the buckler\r\nnot reticulated; by the abdomen with but 8 articulations.\r\n\r\nFrom _Asaphus_. By the middle lobe, which is double the size of the\r\nlateral ones; by the absence of a membranaceous expansion on the sides;\r\nby the non-reticulation of the eyes, &c.\r\n\r\nFrom _Ogygia_. By the rolled form, the rounded posterior angles of the\r\nbuckler, and the distinct articulation of the longitudinal lobes.\r\n\r\nFrom _Paradoxide_ and _Agnoste_ by characters too obvious to be\r\nenumerated. (See Annals of N. York Lyceum, Sec. Vol. I. pp. 174-5.)\r\n\r\nIn 1826, J. W. Dalman published in the Transactions of the Swedish\r\nAcademy, and also in a separate work, an account of the trilobites\r\nfound in the North of Europe, in which he has enriched the family by\r\na number of fine species, and with the following genera, which he\r\nmodestly proposes merely as subdivisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Seventh._ Nileus.\r\n\r\n_Body_ short, capable of contraction into a sphere, smooth, convex.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ with about 8 articulations, without any dorsal longitudinal\r\nfurrows.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_ sub-lunate, with large lateral eyes.\r\n\r\n_Tail_ expanded, not so large as the buckler, without lobes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Eighth._ Illænus.\r\n\r\n_Body_ ovate oblong, contractile.\r\n\r\n_Head_ rounded in front, eyes small, in the temples, very remote.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ with from 9 to 10 articulations, trilobate.\r\n\r\n_Tail_ expanded as large as the head.[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Some of the species described by Professor Dalman as\r\nincluded in this genus, we think ought to be referred to that of the\r\nIsotelus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Ninth._ Ampyx.\r\n\r\n_Body_ very short, contractile.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_ large, triangular, gibbous; eyes not remarkable.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ short, articulations few (6?), trilobate.\r\n\r\n_Tail_ expanded, not so large as the head.\r\n\r\nProfessor Dalman has two other genera, which he calls Olenus and\r\nBattus, the first is the Paradoxides, and the second the Agnostus of\r\nBrongniart.\r\n\r\nIn the 8th Volume of Annales des Sciences Naturelles there is a highly\r\nvaluable paper \"Sur les Trilobites et leurs gisemens,\" by the Count\r\nRasoumowsky, in which he describes some new trilobites from Russia;\r\nthe one which he has figured and described as a Calymene[9] from\r\nTzarsko-Selo, undoubtedly belongs to a new genus, very near to the\r\nIsotelus. The middle lobe is visible or naked through its whole extent,\r\nand the lateral lobes near the tail are covered with a thick cuticular\r\nmembrane. This genus we propose to call Hemicrupturus, and may be thus\r\ncharacterized.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The editors of the Annales remark that this is not a\r\nCalymene, but that it appears to belong to the genus Asaphus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Tenth._ Hemicrupturus.[10]--_Green._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: From three Greek words which signify _half-concealed\r\ntail_.]\r\n\r\n_Body_ contractile.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_ oculiferous and not lobate.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ trilobate, with 8 articulations.\r\n\r\n_Tail_, costal arches covered, middle lobe naked.\r\n\r\nThe Asaphus expansus of Dalman, and several other known species may be\r\narranged under this genus.\r\n\r\nAs Count Rasoumowsky has given no specific appellation to the\r\nfossil above alluded to, we propose to call it after his own name,\r\n_Hemicrupturus Rasoumowskii_. We examined the fine specimen from which\r\nour cast is taken in the cabinet of the Baltimore College, and for this\r\nfavour we are indebted to the kindness of Dr. J. J. Cohen, one of the\r\nProfessors in that rising institution.\r\n\r\nThe following list includes _all_ the genera and species of the\r\nTrilobite Family, hitherto described as far as known to the author.

United States.\r\n\r\nFrom the short descriptions given by Professor Rafinesque of the five\r\nlast mentioned fossils, I conclude that they belong to the genus\r\nCalymene of Brongniart.\r\n\r\nThe study of the trilobites naturally leads to the consideration of\r\nthose beings which appear to have inhabited our earth previous to the\r\ncreation of man. Every one knows that the sceptical naturalist has\r\ndrawn from these vestiges of organic life, an argument contradictory\r\nto the Mosaic account of the history of the world, and though every\r\ncavil of the least importance, urged against the truth of the sacred\r\nhistorian, has been triumphantly confuted, still, the geological\r\nsciolist boldly impugns his veracity, whenever any new facts in his\r\nscience can be distorted to his purpose. Such being the case, we\r\ncannot conclude this preface without briefly stating two or three\r\nmethods by which any seeming discrepancies may be explained. First,\r\nthose who imagine that the six periods of creation, mentioned in the\r\nbeginning of the pentateuch, mean literally days of 24 hours each,\r\nbelieve that, as only a small part of the earth was at first required\r\nfor the abode of man and the higher animals, the present continents\r\nmight have remained as long beneath the waters, and have undergone\r\nevery change necessary to solve this geological puzzle.\r\n\r\nAgain, others have thought that Moses, after recording, in the first\r\nsentence of Genesis, the great truth that all things were made by the\r\nwill of an intelligent Creator--passed silently over some intermediate\r\nstate of the earth, which had no direct relation to the history, or to\r\nthe duties of man--and proceeded to describe the successive appearance\r\nof the present order of things. On this supposition, the fossil remains\r\nand peculiarities in the structure of the earth may have belonged to\r\nthat intermediate state.\r\n\r\nA third method of explaining the difficulty, and which we think highly\r\nsatisfactory, is, by understanding the days of creation to mean, not\r\nordinary days, but _periods of time_, in which the recorded events took\r\nplace in the order described so briefly by the sacred historian. It is\r\nacknowledged by every one competent to judge, that among the Hebrews,\r\n_days_ and _weeks_ were often used in this manner. The accordance\r\nbetween the order in which, according to the account of Moses,\r\nthe work of creation was accomplished, and the order in which the\r\nfossil remains of plants and animals are deposited in the earth, has\r\nsurprised, and has been acknowledged by learned sceptics themselves.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: The Baron Cuvier, on this subject, remarks, respecting\r\nthe Jewish legislator--\"His books show us, that he had very perfect\r\nideas respecting several of the highest questions of natural\r\nphilosophy. His cosmogony, especially, considered purely in a\r\nscientific point of view, is extremely remarkable, inasmuch as the\r\norder which it assigns to the different epochs of creation, is\r\nprecisely the same as that which has been deduced from geological\r\nconsiderations.\"]\r\n\r\nIt will be useless to push these arguments further. The catastrophes\r\nwhich have produced the secondary strata, and the diluvian depositions,\r\ncould not have been local or partial phenomena; but rather than call\r\nupon a comet, with the abstracted philosopher, to deluge the earth\r\nfor every new geological epoch--or to change the axis of motion of\r\nour planet--or to resort to any of his wild, fanciful, and impious\r\ntheories, we should, with Sir Humphrey Davy, even prefer the dream that\r\nall the secondary strata were _created_, filled with the remains, as it\r\nwere, of animal life, to confound the speculations of our geological\r\nreasoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery author who attempts a Monograph of any of the departments of\r\nNatural History, must necessarily depend, in a greater or less degree,\r\nupon the kindness and liberality of others. Rare and unique specimens,\r\nparticularly of fossil species, are often scattered through different\r\ncabinets, and his work would be rendered very imperfect, if they were\r\nnot intrusted to his care. In preparing the following Monograph on the\r\nplan of giving exact models of the species, instead of illustrating\r\nthem by engravings in the usual manner, the specimens when used by\r\nthe artist are perhaps more liable to accident, and it was at first\r\nsupposed that this circumstance might have prevented the original\r\ndesign. But in no instance, where an application has been made, either\r\nto a public institution or to a private cabinet, has the author met\r\nwith a refusal; indeed the courtesy, kindness, and liberality which\r\nhe has experienced from naturalists, who have every where aided him\r\nin the prosecution of his work, form no inconsiderable portion of the\r\ngratification which he has received. Besides the acknowledgments to\r\npublic museums, and to individuals, which are made in the body of the\r\nwork, the author is desirous of recording in this place, the following\r\ncabinets from which he has derived much assistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           IN PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n               The Cabinet of John P.

The fossil animals included by it are\r\ncharacterized as having contractile bodies; the buckler as bearing many\r\ntubercles or folds--the cheeks as being oculiferous, and the abdomen\r\nand tail as being composed of from twelve to fourteen articulations\r\nor joints, without any membranaceous expansion. The Calymenes in\r\nthickness are nearly semicylindrical, and the buckler in front presents\r\na _chaperon_ or upper lip more or Jess raised. In perfect specimens,\r\nthere is a small furrow which seems to indicate a separation between\r\nthe upper and under parts of this kind of lip. The eyes are always\r\nraised, and frequently present the remarkable structure observable in\r\nmany of the _crustacea_; but as this part is generally very prominent,\r\nthe _reticulations_ of the eye are commonly worn off or injured.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brongniart places but little confidence in any of the generic\r\ncharacters above enumerated, except the number of articulations of the\r\nabdomen: these, however, in our opinion, are more vague and uncertain\r\nthan most of the others. The genus, however, we think may be readily\r\nidentified, after becoming familiar with one well characterized\r\nspecies. The general aspect of the buckler is peculiar--the body is\r\nnot so depressed as in most other genera, and the lateral lobes are\r\ndestitute of all membranaceous expansion.\r\n\r\nTo the genus Calymene, belongs the celebrated Dudley fossil, called\r\n_Entomolithus paradoxus_ by Blumenbach, but which is not the same\r\norganic relic, to which Linné applied that name.\r\n\r\nThis genus includes a great number of species, and though some of them\r\nare said to be found in different and distant parts of the globe, they\r\nare according to our limited observation, for the most part confined,\r\nlike recent species of animals, to particular districts. The C.\r\npolytoma, C. pulchella, C. bellatula, C. concinna, C. sclerops, and\r\nthe C. punctata, all finely figured by Professor Dalman, and which\r\nare found in Sweden, have not yet been noticed in any part of North\r\nAmerica.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See the valuable and extensive communication of J. W.\r\nDalman, M. D., on the Trilobites, in the Transactions of the Swedish\r\nAcademy for 1820, part 2d.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Blumenbachii. _Brongniart._ Cast No. 1.\r\n\r\n  Clypeo rotundato, tuberculis sex distinctis in fronte; oculis in\r\n  genis emintissimis; corpore tuberculato.\r\n\r\nIn this species the upper lip presents a furrow parallel to its edges.\r\nThe lip is straight. The cheeks are a little projecting. There are\r\nsix rounded tubercles on the front, and fourteen articulations on the\r\nback; the tail is small, and the shell is covered with small rounded\r\ntubercles of unequal sizes.\r\n\r\nThe above is Professor Brongniart's description of this trilobite,\r\nwhich is the famous Dudley fossil described and figured by Littleton,\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions, (London) in 1750. According\r\nto Dalman, several distinct European species have been published\r\nunder this name. The true C. Blumenbachii, he says, has thirteen\r\narticulations to the abdomen, and about eight to the tail. In the\r\ncabinet of G. W. Featherstonhaugh, Esq., we have examined a fine\r\nperfect specimen from Dudley,[13] in which there is fourteen abdominal\r\njoints. There can be no doubt, however, that several species have been\r\nconfounded under the name of C. Blumenbachii; Dalman's C. Tuberculata\r\nand C. Pulchella are, we think, distinct from it, though he has marked\r\nthem only as varieties.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: This famous trilobite, once formed a part of the cabinet\r\nof Mr. Parkinson, the distinguished author of the \"Organic Remains,\"\r\nand is accurately figured on one of the plates of that splendid work.\r\nAt the sale of the late Mr. Parkinson's fossils, it was purchased by\r\nMr. Featherstonhaugh,]\r\n\r\nThe true C. Blumenbachii, no doubt, abounds in North America, and is\r\none of the few examples of the occurrence of an identical species\r\non both continents. The late Abbe Correa sent a perfect specimen to\r\nBrongniart, from the vicinity of Lebanon, in the state of Ohio. We\r\nhave also seen a number of specimens from that state, which could not\r\nbe distinguished from the Dudley trilobite. Our model was taken from a\r\nspecimen found at Trenton Falls, in the state of New York.\r\n\r\nThe three following species found in the United States, will no doubt\r\nbe considered by many as mere varieties of the C. Blumenbachii; we have\r\nventured, however, to call them by distinct names.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Callicephala.[14] _Green._ Cast No. 2.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: From two Greek words, which signify \"beautiful head.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice attenuato, figura liliiformi in fronte depicta;\r\n  oculis minimis; abdomine quatuordecim articulis; corpore plano.\r\n\r\nThe buckler is subtriangular; on the front there is a figure in high\r\nrelief, somewhat resembling a _fleur de lis_; or perhaps more, the\r\ncapital of a Corinthian column. The oculiferous tubercles are rather\r\nlower down on the cheeks than usual. The articulations of the abdomen\r\nand the tail cannot well be distinguished from each, other; fourteen\r\nin all may be easily counted. The middle lobe of the abdomen is nearly\r\nequal in breadth throughout. The ribs, or costal arches, are not\r\ngrooved or bifurcated at their extremities. Length nearly two inches\r\nand a half.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful species is in the Philadelphia Museum, where it is\r\nlabelled as being found in \"Hampshire, Virginia.\" It is mineralized by\r\na dark yellowish limestone. It differs from the C. Blumenbachii, in\r\nthe form and number of its articulations; in the shape of the head; in\r\nhaving only two flat tuberculous elevations on the front; and in other\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nIn the cabinet of the New York Lyceum, and in that of J. P. Wetherill,\r\nEsq. there are some examples of this species from the Miami river, near\r\nCincinnati, Ohio. I have also seen it from Indiana, in a dark coloured\r\nlimestone, very much distorted. It has never been found at Trenton\r\nfalls, or at any other locality, as far as my knowledge extends, which\r\nyields the true C. Blumenbachii.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Selenecephala.[15] _Green._ Cast No. 3.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: From the Greek for \"lunate head.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice rotundato, margine omni valde incrassato; prominentia\r\n  frontali utrinque trituberosa; corpore tuberculato.\r\n\r\nThe buckler is regularly lunate; the margin is slightly reflected or\r\nraised anteriorly, the posterior edge forms a continuous rim, running\r\nnearly parallel with the articulations of the abdomen. The front on\r\neach side has one large and two small tubercles, near its superior\r\nedge. The oculiferous tubercles on the cheeks are on a line with the\r\nlowest frontal tubercle. There are fourteen distinct articulations;\r\nbut as the tail is mutilated and distorted, the total number of\r\njoints cannot, from this specimen, be ascertained. The body appears\r\nto have been covered with small pustules. These are very evident on\r\nthe front. Costal arches simple, or not grooved. Length, one inch and\r\nthree-fourths, breadth of the buckler one inch and one-fourth.\r\n\r\nThis species resembles a little the C. Pulchella of Dalman. The\r\nspecimen from which the model was taken, is in the possession of Mr.\r\nR. Peale, of New York, who willingly lent it for this monograph. He\r\ninformed me that it was found in the state of New York, but he was\r\nunable to name its precise locality. It occurs in a soft ash coloured\r\nlimestone. No other petrifaction is observable in the fragment of rock\r\nwhich contains it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Platys.[16] _Green._ Casts No. 4 and 5.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: From a Greek word which signifies Flat,]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice rotundato; prominentia frontali utrinque quatuor\r\n  tuberculis.\r\n\r\nThe buckler is probably semilunate; but as the anterior portion is\r\nlost, this cannot be determined with precision. The posterior raised\r\nrim is not continuous, as in the C. Selenecephala, but is separated by\r\nthe longitudinal dorsal furrows. The front is distinctly divided from\r\nthe cheeks, and has four tubercular prominences on each side. Three\r\nof them are nearly on a line with the lateral edge of the cheeks, and\r\ngradually diminish in size, as they descend to the anterior part of\r\nthe buckler. The other is smaller, and is between, and a little to\r\nthe side, of the upper two. The cheeks form spherical triangles. The\r\noculiferous prominences are close to the second large tubercle on the\r\nfront. The cheeks are, however, quite imperfect. The articulations\r\nof the back cannot be distinguished from those of the tail. In our\r\nspecimen they are all beautifully distinct, and are twenty-two in\r\nnumber. The posterior raised rim of the buckler seems to form an\r\narticulation; its extremities on each side are a good deal thickened\r\nand expanded. The costal arches suddenly curve downwards and backwards,\r\nnear their middle, so as to divide the abdomen and tail into five\r\nunequal sections. The whole length is nearly three inches. The breadth\r\nof the buckler nearly two inches.\r\n\r\nThis fine large Calymene was accidentally discovered on the Helderberg\r\nmountain, by my friend, Professor T. R. Beck. One of the loose pieces\r\nof sandstone rolling over, near his feet, presented him the fine\r\nnatural mould, from which he has kindly permitted our cast to be taken.\r\nThe animal relic once enclosed in this matrix, must still be near that\r\nlocality, and yet remains undiscovered, to reward the enterprise of\r\nsome more fortunate naturalist.\r\n\r\nOne of our models represents the natural mould found by Dr. Beck. The\r\nother is a cast taken from it and exhibits, more satisfactorily, the\r\nvarious parts of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Microps.[17] _Green._ Cast No. 6.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: From the Greek for \"small eyes.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice subattenuato; occulis minimis in lateribus capitis;\r\n  abdominis articulis a 14 ad 18; corpore depresso.\r\n\r\nThe buckler is semi-elliptical, slightly punctate, and much depressed\r\nanteriorly; the front and cheeks are not very distinctly marked. The\r\neyes are very remote from each other, being situated near the posterior\r\nlateral angles of the head. They are not very prominent, and exhibit\r\nno marks of being reticulated. Before the eye on each side, there is\r\na slight transverse indentation. It is difficult to distinguish the\r\narticulations of the abdomen from those of the tail. They are from\r\nfourteen to eighteen in number. Where the lateral lobes remain perfect,\r\ntwo narrow raised lines appear between each of the ribs; these are\r\nmost evident on the caudal extremities of the animal. The middle lobe\r\nis in the form of a long, slender, and acute cone. The whole animal is\r\nan inch and a quarter long, and is much more depressed than any other\r\nCalymene which we have seen.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. Titian R. Peale for the use of the original from\r\nwhich our model was taken, his liberality to those who cultivate\r\nNatural History is proverbial, and needs no encomium from me. The C.\r\nMicrops is said to have been found near Ripley, Ohio. It occurs in\r\nblack limestone.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of this Calymene are small in comparison with those of some\r\nother species--particularly the C. Bufo, C. Macrophthalma, and C.\r\nAnchiops.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Anchiops.[18] _Green._ Cast No. 7.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: From two Greek words which signify \"eyes approximate.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice, caudaque postice rotundatis; oculis approximis,\r\n  magnis, excertis; articulis vigenti; corpore plano.\r\n\r\nThe buckler of this species is irregularly hemispherical; the front\r\npyriform and without pustulations. The cheeks are almost entirely\r\noccupied by the eyes, which are placed very near each other on the\r\nupper part of the forehead; are very large and trilobate, the side\r\nlobes being elongated and attenuated in front. The articulations\r\nof the back are twenty in number, those of the abdomen not being\r\ndistinguishable from those of the tail. The costal arches of the side\r\nlobes are round near their extremities, and are intersected with two or\r\nthree raised lines. Length nearly four inches. Breadth about two inches.\r\n\r\nIt gives me great satisfaction in being able to describe, and to\r\npresent to naturalists a good cast of this Calymene, which has\r\nexcited for a long time so much interest and perplexity. The original\r\nfossil from which our plaster model was made is now deposited in\r\nthe cabinet of the Albany Institute, and is the identical specimen\r\nfrom which a cast was long since made, by Dr. Hosack of New York, a\r\nspecimen of which he sent in July, 1819, to the Royal Academy of\r\nScience, in France. Professor Brongniart referred the animal from\r\nwhich this model was taken, though with much hesitation and doubt,\r\nto the species, Calymene Macrophthalma. He remarks concerning it,\r\n\"Il est beaucoup plus gros que les autres individus, et a prés de\r\ndneuf centimètres de longueur. C'est avec doute que je rapporté\r\ncette empreinte tres-peu nette à l'espèce actuelle; mais malgré ses\r\nformés obtuses, et l'absence de tout detail, elle est si remarquable\r\npar la grosseur de ces yeux et par le prolongement de son bouclier\r\nqu'on peut présumer qu'elle appartient an calyméne macrophthalme, et\r\navec d'autànt plus de probabilité qu'elle vient aussi des Etats Unis\r\nd'Amérique. Elle a été trouvée, suivant M. Hosack, dans un schiste.\"\r\nWe have seen the cast alluded to in the above note, and are not at all\r\nsurprised at the uncertainty which it has occasioned. The apparent\r\nprolongation of the buckler is entirely occasioned by the loss of a\r\nsmall fragment from that portion of the head. The form and position of\r\nthe eyes, further distinguish it from any of the numerous specimens\r\nof C. Macrophthalma, that we have examined. The raised lines which we\r\nhave noticed as intersecting the costal arches of the lateral lobes\r\nare remarkable, though they may have been produced by accidental\r\nfissures in the epidermal covering of the animal. The head of the C.\r\nMacrophthalma is always marked by minute and prominent granulations,\r\nlike _shagreen_--nothing of this kind appears on the buckler of the C.\r\nAnchiops.\r\n\r\nI am informed by my friend, Dr. T. R. Beck, to whose liberality I owe\r\nthis interesting species, that it was found in Ulster county, New\r\nYork. It was supposed by Dr. Hosack, to have been discovered in the\r\nvicinity of Albany. Respecting the locality and geological relations of\r\nthis trilobite, Professor Brongniart remarks, \"un modéle en plâtre de\r\ntrilobite envoyé à l'Académie des Sciences, en Juillet, 1819, par M.\r\nHosack, et que j'ai rapporté, autant que la chose était possible, et\r\ntoujours avec doute, au calyméne macrophthalme, a été trouvé dans le\r\nterritoire d'Albany, êtat de New York. Or, les environs de cette ville\r\nsont indiqués, sur la carte géologique de M. Maclure, comme formés de\r\nterrains de transition. M. Hosack dit qu'il a été trouvé au milieu d'un\r\nrocher ardoisé, c'est à dire, dans un schiste probablement analogue à\r\ncelui des environs d'Angers, qui renferme les Ogygies, et ce trilobite\r\nce rapproche un peu de ce genre par la grosseur des tubercules qui\r\nrecouvrent les yeux on en tiennent la place.\" The rock in which the\r\nCalymene Anchiops is found, appears to be a clay slate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Diops.[19] _Green._ Cast No. 8, and fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: From the Greek for \"Double Eyes.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo lobato plano; rugis tribus in lateribus frontis; tuberculis\r\n  oculiformibus, eminentissimis et duplicibus; articulis octodecim;\r\n  cauda rotunda.\r\n\r\nThis species is very distinct from every other Calymene that we have\r\nseen. The outline of the buckler is lobate lunate; the front is very\r\nconvex, and a good deal elevated above the cheeks or sides, from\r\nwhich it is divided by a deep furrow; on the posterior margin of the\r\nfront on each side, close to the groove there is a prominent circular\r\ntubercle, before which there are three small transverse wrinkles.\r\nThe cheeks are subtriangular; the oculiform tubercle is near the\r\nposterior superior angle, and is only separated from the tubercle on\r\nthe front, by the furrow or groove, so that the animal seems to have\r\nhad double eyes on each side; there are two curved lines on each side\r\nbelow the eyes, crossed near the front by a deep short canal. The\r\nmiddle lobe of the abdomen and tail is rather longer than the lateral\r\nlobes, and is rounded and very prominent throughout. It is composed\r\nof 18 articulations, seven of which appear to belong to the tail; it\r\nis, however, somewhat difficult to define the length of the tail with\r\nprecision. The costal arches of the lateral lobes, particularly those\r\nnear the tail, are bifurcate. Length almost three inches.\r\n\r\nThe original fossil, from which the cast was taken, is in the New York\r\nMuseum. I am indebted to Mr. Rubens Peale, the liberal proprietor of\r\nthat flourishing and important institution, not only for the use of\r\nit in this Monograph, but also for some valuable information relating\r\nto other species. The precise locality of Mr. Peale's specimen is\r\nnot known, but in the cabinet of J. P. Wetherill, Esq., there is a\r\nfine head of the C. diops which was found in the State of Ohio. Both\r\nspecimens are mineralized by the same kind of soft grey coloured\r\nlimestone--and I have but little doubt that they were derived from the\r\nsame place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Macrophthalma.[20] _Brongniart._ Cast No. 9.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: From the Greek for \"Great eyes.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice, caudaque postice attenuatis, oculis magnis exsertis.\r\n\r\nThis species, according to Al. Brongniart, who first described it,\r\nis remarkable for the magnitude and protuberance of its eye-shaped\r\ntubercles, and by the prolongation of the anterior portion of the\r\nbuckler, in the form of a snout.\r\n\r\nThe back is marked by 12 or 13 articulations, which are thicker than\r\nthose of the tail. The tail is short, pointed, and without expansion.\r\n\r\nThe middle lobe, or front of the _buckler_, in this calymene, is said\r\nby Brongniart to be marked on its sides by three oblique plicæ or\r\nwrinkles, but we have not been able to discover this character in any\r\nof the specimens to which we have access; neither do they exhibit any\r\nremarkable prolongation in the anterior portion of the _buckler_, as\r\nstated in his specific character. The specimens which we have examined,\r\nagree pretty well with the representation he has given of the C.\r\nMacrophthalma, Plate I. fig. 5. A. B. & C. made from a drawing by Mr.\r\nStokes, from a fossil found in Coalbrookdale (Eng.).\r\n\r\nThis trilobite is common in several parts of the United States.\r\nAccording to Dr. J. E. Dekay,[21] the C. Macrophthalma is found on\r\nthe Helderberg mountains, near Albany, and at Coshung creek, not\r\nfar from Seneca lake, in the State of New York. It occurs also at\r\nLeheighton, in Pennsylvania--at the Falls of the Ohio, and at several\r\nother localities. We have examined a number of specimens of the C.\r\nMacrophthalma, contained in the rich cabinet of fossils, in the Academy\r\nof Natural Sciences, and have never seen any individual which resembles\r\nthe fig. 4, Plate I. of Brongniart; and in no instance is the front\r\nof the buckler marked by three oblique folds, a character stated as\r\npeculiar to this species. The C. Macrophthalma, (variety) occurs in\r\nlarge quantities in Leheighton in Pennsylvania, and we are indebted to\r\nMr. D. Keim, for some fine specimens from that locality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: See Annals of Lyceum, Vol. I. p. 188.]\r\n\r\nThe authority of Professor Brongniart is sufficient to place the C.\r\nMacrophthalma among the species of the United States, though we have\r\nbeen unable fully to identify it with his description.[22] He received\r\na specimen, transformed into red jasper, from Prof. Ducatel, said\r\nto be found in the United States--no precise locality is given. Our\r\nmodel represents the animal which is supposed to be the one intended\r\nby Brongniart as the C. Macrophthalma of North America. It is, in our\r\nopinion, a variety of the C. Bufo. There can be no doubt that several\r\nspecies have been confounded under the name of C. Macrophthalma.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: We have seen in the Cabinet of Mr. Featherstonhaugh, a\r\nfine group of trilobites, in the transition limestone, from Dudley,\r\n(Eng.) Among them there is a perfect head, which agrees exactly with\r\nthe description given by Mr. Brongniart of the head of his Calymene\r\nMacrophthalma. If this belongs to the true macrophthalma, our species\r\nunder that name is entirely distinct. Since our work had been prepared\r\nfor the press, Dr. J. J. Cohen, of the Baltimore College, has shown\r\nus the fragment of a calymene from Berkley, Virginia, which agrees\r\nwith Brongniart's description of the macrophthalma, and with the above\r\nfossil from Dudley. We regret that the imperfection of the fossil\r\nprevents our giving a satisfactory cast of it.]\r\n\r\nThe following extract of a letter from Professor Ducatel to the author,\r\nreferring to the locality of this species, will be read with interest.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot be positive as to my recollection of the locality of the\r\nfossil referred to by Brongniart and yourself, but believe it is one\r\nof several found by my friend Dr. M'Culloh, in the neighbourhood of\r\nBerkley Springs, Virginia. I regret that I have not in my possession\r\nanother specimen to present to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Bufo. _Green._ Cast No. 10.\r\n\r\n  Clypeo rotundato, convexo, punctato; abdominis articulis sexdecim;\r\n  cauda attenuata; corpore plano.\r\n\r\nBuckler semilunate, front very large, rounded before and arcuated at\r\nthe insertion of the middle lobe; surface convex, and marked with\r\nnumerous depressed pimples. Mouth large, lunate, resembling that of\r\na toad or frog, with a narrow raised rim on the upper and under lip.\r\nBelow the chin there are no pustulations. Cheeks small, triangular,\r\nand separated from the front by a deep, rectilinear furrow; the eyes\r\nin our specimen are much injured, but they are large, and near the\r\nupper angle of the cheeks. Middle lobe with a series of distinct double\r\narticulations. Lateral lobes wider than the middle lobe, ribs deeply\r\ngrooved near their insertion; articulations of the abdomen twelve; of\r\nthe tail ten. Length four inches and a half; breadth of the buckler\r\nnearly two inches.\r\n\r\nThis fossil was presented to me some time since by Thomas P. Johnson,\r\nEsq., who mentioned that it was found in New Jersey, but that he could\r\nnot learn its precise locality. Near Patterson, in that State, some\r\ntrilobites have been discovered--perhaps the C. Bufo may have been\r\nderived from that locality. It is composed of a dark greyish limestone,\r\neasily cut with a knife.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalymene Bufo. Variety, Rana. Cast Nos. 11 & 12.\r\n\r\nThis fine specimen differs from the one above described, in having the\r\nfront of the buckler rather smaller, and of a different contour. The\r\nwhole of the shell is also covered with granulations, which only appear\r\non the head of the other; this, however, may be only an imperfection in\r\nthe specimens in our cabinet.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the Albany Institute for the originals of the models\r\nNos. 11 & 12. They were found at Seneca, Ontario County, New York, in\r\ndark, slaty limestone, which also contains cubical crystals of iron\r\npyrites. A fortunate blow of the hammer has fractured the rock which\r\ncontains this trilobite, so neatly, as to present us at the same time\r\nwith the petrified animal in an almost perfect state, and also with\r\nthe mould or matrix in which it was imbedded. This arrangement is\r\nbeautifully illustrated by our models.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Asaphus. _Brongniart._\r\n\r\nThis genus derives its name from the Greek word Ασαφης--obscure. It\r\nembraces perhaps more species than any other genus of the family of\r\ntrilobites. About twenty have already been discovered. Most of them\r\nare very characteristic and can easily be determined, but as the genus\r\nAsaphus, is intermediate between Calymene and Ogygia, it is sometimes a\r\nlittle difficult to decide the genus to which the inosculating species\r\non each side, belongs.\r\n\r\nIn general, the Asaphs may be known by the body being very much\r\ndepressed, and by the membranaceous development, which extends beyond\r\nthe lateral lobes. The middle lobe of the abdomen, is rarely more\r\nthan one-fifth the width of the body. As the abdomen and tail of the\r\nAsaph are the only portions of the animal commonly found entire, the\r\ndistinctive characters of the genus above given, may generally be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nProfessor Brongniart remarks, that the ribs of the _Asaph_, which\r\ncorrespond in number and position to the articulations of the middle\r\nlobe, \"are sometimes simple or undivided, at least in the post abdomen,\r\nbut that they are always bifurcated in the _Calymene_\" As far as our\r\nobservations have extended, these remarks do not apply either in the\r\none case or the other.\r\n\r\nThe head or buckler of the _Asaph_, is not so deeply divided into\r\nthree lobes as the _Calymene_; they are, however, quite distinct. The\r\noculiferous tubercles are in some species exceedingly well marked by a\r\nreticulated structure.\r\n\r\nThis genus often occurs at the same localities with the Calymene,\r\nthough in some instances it seems to occupy rocks peculiar to itself.\r\nDr. John Bigsby, in his list of organic remains occurring in the\r\nCanadas, states, that he never found a single species of the genus\r\nCalymene, on the north side of the River St. Lawrence, although\r\nthe Asaphs were very abundant.[23] In his Sketch of the Geology of\r\nthe Island of Montreal, he however observes: \"Of Trilobites, the\r\nAsaph genus is the most abundant, they approach nearest the species\r\n_caudatus_, of Brongniart. I have found no entire Calymene, but many\r\nbucklers or heads of the Blumenbach species, some of them an inch and a\r\nhalf in diameter. They are found whole in considerable numbers in the\r\nvicinity of Quebec.\"[24]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Silliman's Journal, vol. viii. p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Annals New York Lyceum, vol. i. p. 214.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Laticostatus.[25] _Green._ Cast No. 13.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: From the Latin for \"broad ribbed.\"]\r\n\r\n  Cauda prælonga, pars ad marginem vix membranacea; cute coriacea,\r\n  tuberculis minimis; costis latis, convexis et valde distinctis.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of this species, which we have examined, comprise ten\r\narticulations of the middle lobe, and the corresponding ribs of the\r\nsides, all in a very good state of preservation; the extent to which\r\nthe membranaceous expansion reached beyond the tail and the lateral\r\nlobes is very apparent, but it has been unfortunately broken off all\r\nround. Our specimen appears to be a natural cast of the internal part\r\nof the shell, or the coriaceous covering of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe portion of this specimen of trilobite which still remains perfect,\r\nis two inches long, and three inches and a quarter broad. The middle\r\nlobe exhibits the appearance of a very exact and gradually tapering\r\ncone, its articulations being rounded and slightly flattened on the\r\ntop. The ribs of the lateral lobes are nearly straight, slightly\r\narched, broad, rounded, and gradually increase in width from the point\r\nof their insertion; they are simple or not bifurcated throughout, and\r\nare covered with very minute granulations, which are probably produced\r\nby the sandstone in which the animal is mineralized. The membranaceous\r\nexpansion near the caudal termination, is a good deal prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe A. Laticostatus occurs in a light coloured ferruginous sandstone,\r\nwhich contains a multitude of other fossil remains, particularly\r\na large species of Productus and of Terebratula. It is said to\r\nhave been found in Ulster county, in the State of New York, by the\r\nlate Charles Wilson Peale, Esq., the distinguished founder of the\r\nPhiladelphia Museum. During the memorable search after the bones\r\nof the _Mastodon Giganteum_, in the marl pits of that county, this\r\nenterprising naturalist procured our Asaph with many other remarkable\r\npetrifactions. The rocks which contain them were probably found not\r\n_in situ_, but were masses rolled from the neighbouring Shawangunk\r\nmountains,[26] which by some geologists are supposed to be a link in\r\nthe grand chain of the Alleghanies. Mr. R. Peale, of New York, lately\r\nvisited the rich repository of fossils in Ulster County, and procured a\r\nnumber of specimens of the A. Laticostatus, all of which he has kindly\r\npermitted me to examine. These are much smaller than our cast, but in\r\nmany instances the caudal elongation is perfectly developed. The A.\r\nLaticostatus also occurs in the Helderberg mountains, specimens of\r\nwhich are in the Albany Institute.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: The Lenape tribe of Indians, who formerly inhabited this\r\ndistrict of country, gave the name of Shawangunk to this stupendous\r\nridge of hills a name which has been very properly preserved.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Selenurus.[27] _Eaton._ Casts Nos. 14 & 15.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Derived from _Selene_, moon, and _ouros_, tail.]\r\n\r\n  Cauda semilunari; costis angustis, valde distinctis; abdominis\r\n  articulis duodecim; corpore convexo.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Professor Eaton, for two specimens of this very\r\ninteresting species. In his Geological Text Book, he thus describes\r\nit: \"Tail crescent-form, or concavo-convex, with the convex side\r\nforward, upon which the post abdomen terminates: abdomen contains\r\nabout 12 articulations, with an abrupt termination equal in breadth\r\nto one-fourth of the length of the transverse lunate tail; the\r\narticulations of the side lobes gradually incline towards the axis\r\nof the body, until the last pair terminate at the tail. Found in\r\ntransition limestone at Glenn's Falls, and Becroft's mountain, near\r\nHudson. I have a specimen from Becroft's mountain, with part of the\r\noriginal covering of the animal remaining.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we first noticed the remarkable lunate appearance of the tail\r\nof this Asaph, we supposed that it was occasioned by some accident,\r\nbut there seems no doubt that this conformation is natural. In\r\nour specimens of this species, which are not however perfect,\r\nthe articulations of the abdomen do not exceed 8 in number. The\r\nrepresentation of this animal remain given by Mr. Eaton, plate 1,\r\nfigure 1, is exceedingly inaccurate; it will confuse rather than\r\nillustrate the subject. Our cast and the drawing, we believe, are taken\r\nfrom the same specimen, which was kindly loaned by Mr. Eaton for this\r\nwork. It is but justice to the amiable, industrious, and indefatigable\r\nauthor of the Geological Text Book to remark, that he regrets as much\r\nas any one, the insufficiency of his figures of the trilobites, to give\r\nany correct idea of the fossils they are intended to represent.\r\n\r\nIn the cabinet of the Albany Institute there are a number of specimens\r\nof the A. Selenurus. One of our models represents the natural mould\r\nmade by the animal in the rock; the other is an impression taken from\r\nit, in order to exhibit the animal in a more satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Limulurus.[28] _Green._ Cast No. 16.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: From two Greek words, which signify \"Limulus tailed.\"]\r\n\r\n  Cauda longa, spina munita sicut in Limulo; costis abdominis in\r\n  spinis retrorsum flexis, desinentibus.\r\n\r\nIt is very much to be regretted that the abdomen and caudal end only of\r\nthis remarkable Asaph have hitherto been discovered; it is, however,\r\nexceedingly gratifying that the fragment still remains in so perfect a\r\nstate. It forms a part of the magnificent cabinet of organic remains\r\nbelonging to J. P. Wetherill, Esq., now deposited in the Academy of\r\nNatural Sciences, of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDr. J. J. Cohen discovered a small specimen of this species at\r\nLockport, New York, which he has presented to the Athenæum, in\r\nBaltimore.\r\n\r\nEight articulations of the abdomen, and ten of the tail, are all of\r\nthis fine species that we have seen. The ribs, or costal arches of\r\nthe abdomen have a deep furrow on their upper surface, commencing\r\nat the middle lobe, and terminating near their free extremities;\r\nthese extremities appear all detached from each other, and end in\r\nreflected points or spines, so as to give the side of the animal a\r\nserrate appearance. The costal arches of the tail are grooved through\r\ntheir whole extent, and present no spinous terminations. Beyond the\r\nmembranaceous expansion of the tail, which is somewhat similar to that\r\nof the Asaphus Caudatus, there projects a single spine, like that from\r\nthe tail of the _Limulus polyphemus_; this spine may be traced under\r\nthe caudal membrane to its insertion into the middle lobe. A portion\r\nof the crustaceous shell is still entire, and it seems to have been\r\ncovered with very minute granulations. A row of large granulations\r\nmay easily be traced on each side of the middle lobe. Length of the\r\nfragment, one inch and a half. Breadth one inch and a fourth.\r\n\r\nThe A. Limulurus was found in the dark brown, shaly limestone, at\r\nLockport, in the State of New York; it is associated in the same rock\r\nwith the terebratula and several other fossils.\r\n\r\nThe singular spinous projection from the tail of this Asaph, furnishes\r\nanother analogy, between the trilobite and the limulus; an affinity\r\nwhich was suggested by Dr. Dekay; and which has been argued with great\r\ningenuity both by himself and Professor Wahlenberg.[29]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See Nova Acta Regiæ Societatis Upsalensis: 1821. Also,\r\nAnnals of the Lyceum of Natural History. New York. Vol. i. pages\r\n179-185.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Caudatus.[30] _Brünnich. Brongn._ Cast No, 17.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: From the Latin word for \"tailed,\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice subrotundato, postice valde emarginato, angulo\r\n  externo in mucronem producto; oculis exsertis, conicis, truncatis,\r\n  distincte reliculatis; post abdomine in caudam membranaceam, acutam\r\n  extenso. (Vide Brongniart.)\r\n\r\nThe middle lobe of the buckler is marked by three transverse plicæ\r\nor folds on its posterior part, and its cheeks or lateral portions\r\nare triangular; the posterior exterior angles of which, are acute,\r\nand considerably elongated. The cheeks are furnished with conical,\r\ntruncated, semilunar and externally convex tubercles, which were beyond\r\nall doubt the eyes of the animal, being reticulated as in those of\r\nthe Limulus. The middle lobe of the back is narrow, and has twelve\r\narticulations. The lateral lobes are composed of double ribbed costal\r\narches. Beyond the lateral lobes and the caudal termination, there is a\r\nsmooth, thick membranaceous expansion, which forms an acute projection\r\nbelow the central portion of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe specimen in the Philadelphia Museum, by which I have identified\r\nthis species, is marked as coming from Ripley, Ohio. It reposes on a\r\nfragment of ash coloured limestone--which contains also a mutilated\r\nspecimen of what seems to be a calymene, and a few small terebratulæ,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nDr. John Bigsby, in his \"List of Organic Remains, occurring in the\r\nCanadas,\" states that the A. caudatus is frequently met with, thrown\r\nup by the water on the north shore of Lake Superior--on the bank of\r\nRainy river--at the Lake of the Woods, and at several other places. In\r\nsome localities they are astonishingly numerous, and so small as to be\r\nalmost microscopic. They occupy indiscriminately limestone of every\r\ncolour, but are most numerous in that which is brown or crystallized.\r\nThey are composed of the kind of limestone in which they happen to be\r\nembedded.\r\n\r\nWe have seen a number of specimens of this species in the Albany\r\nInstitute, in Mr. Wetherill's cabinet, and in the Baltimore Athenæum;\r\nbut in all of them, the abdomen and caudal extremity only remain\r\nperfect: from their exact resemblance, however, to the same parts of\r\nthe A. caudatus, figured by Brongniart, (plate 2, fig. 4, D.) we have\r\nno hesitation with regard to their identity. The description which\r\nwe have given of the _buckler_, supposed to belong to our Asaph, is\r\ntherefore taken from Brongniart, whose specimens were found at Dudley,\r\nthe celebrated locality of the C. Blumenbachii.[31] The coriaceous\r\nmembrane, which extends beyond the lateral lobes and forms the caudal\r\ntermination of our species, is not covered with minute dots, as in\r\nthe European fossil; and if a new name is to be applied to it on that\r\naccount, it may be called _A. glabratus_.[32] M. Wahlenberg, has given\r\nthe figure of a trilobite which he calls _caudatus_, but ours cannot\r\nbe mistaken for that species, to which Brongniart has very judiciously\r\napplied the name of _A. meucronatus_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: In the first volume, 2d series, of the Transactions of\r\nthe Geological Society of London, Mr. Weaver has published some highly\r\ninteresting observations on the fossils found in Gloucestershire,\r\nEngland. The A. caudatus, he states, is there found in the transition\r\nlimestone, though very much mutilated. (Vide p. 326.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: In the cabinet of G. W. Featherstonhaugh, Esq., I have\r\nexamined a fine specimen of the A. caudatus, from Dudley, England,\r\nbut could not perceive the minute dots on the tail, as mentioned by\r\nBrongniart.]\r\n\r\nThe conical eye-like protuberances on the head of this species, are\r\nvery remarkable, and so much resemble the reticulated eyes of the\r\nlimulus, as to leave no doubt that they once contained the organs of\r\nvision.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Hausmanni. _Brongniart._\r\n\r\n  Cauda rotundata; cute coriacea tuberculis minimis spinulosis tecta.\r\n\r\nIn De la Beche's Geological Manual, there is a list, of the trilobites\r\nwhich have been discovered in the grauwacke group of rocks. This list\r\nwe have given in our introduction. Among the trilobites he states that\r\nthe Asaphus Hausmanni has been found in the United States; as we have\r\nnot seen the species, and presuming the author to be correct in his\r\nlocality, we give the following description from Professor Brongniart.\r\n\r\nI know, he observes, only the tail of this Asaph, but it is so\r\ndifferent from that of other trilobites, that I do not hesitate to\r\nestablish a particular species, upon the consideration of this part\r\nalone. Its general form is that of a semi-ellipsis; the middle lobe\r\nrepresents a very slender cone. The arched ribs of the lateral lobes\r\nare perfectly distinct and simple. I cannot perceive in them the\r\nslightest appearance of bifurcation. This sufficiently characterizes\r\nthe species. But that which further distinguishes it from the others,\r\nare the small, elevated points, scattered, and of course rough\r\n(serrés), with which the skin or epidermis is covered, resembling, in\r\nthis respect, the tail of the _Apus canceriformis_.\r\n\r\nThis fragment of an Asaph is in a homogeneous, compact, blackish\r\nlimestone, which contains no other kind of petrifaction. I know not\r\nwhere it was found. It is in the cabinet of M. de Drée.\r\n\r\nOn plate 2 of Professor Brongniart's work, he has given figures to\r\nillustrate this species; fig. 3 A. represents the whole fragment,\r\nand 3 B. two of the ribs of the lateral lobes, magnified to show the\r\narrangement of the tubercles, which are very peculiar.\r\n\r\nFrom the above description it will be readily perceived, that the A.\r\nHausmanni comes very near to the A. Laticostatus. There are, however,\r\nmany striking differences, which will be obvious to those who compare\r\nour cast with the figures of Brongniart. The shape of the ribs, and the\r\ntubercles upon them; the form of the middle lobe and of the interstices\r\nbetween the articulations, are all peculiar to each. The elongation of\r\nthe tail in our species is alone sufficient to distinguish it. We have\r\nalways been doubtful whether the minute granulations on our species\r\nwere not produced by the sandstone in which it is petrified.\r\n\r\nUpon what authority the A. Hausmanni has been considered as a species\r\nbelonging to the United States we cannot determine. In the valuable\r\nand extensive cabinet of trilobites belonging to the Albany Institute,\r\nthere are a number of specimens labelled with this name by Professor\r\nA. Eaton. If we mistake not, he mentioned to us that similar fragments\r\nof this fossil were sent by him to Brongniart, who, we understand,\r\nis the author of the list of trilobites found in the manual of De la\r\nBeche. The specimens which have been examined, both in the cabinet of\r\nProfessor Eaton, and in that of the Albany Institute, are certainly\r\nnot identical with the figures or descriptions published of the A.\r\nHausmanni. Professor Eaton, in his Geological Text Book, at page 31,\r\nthus describes his A. Hausmanni:--\"Tail rounded, and forming the middle\r\nof a circular arc whose centre is in the fore abdomen, near the head;\r\ncovering tubercled or spined. Found in coral rag on the south shore of\r\nLake Erie. Also, in its underlaying grit slate on the Helderberg.\" Some\r\nother trilobites mentioned in De la Beche's list as occurring in the\r\nUnited States, we have not been so fortunate as to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Pleuroptyx.[33] Cast No. 18.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: From the Greek word for \"grooved ribs.\"]\r\n\r\n  Corpore depresso; cute coriacea tuberculis minimis; costis\r\n  striatis; cauda acuta, brevi.\r\n\r\nThis species like most other specimens of this genus, in our cabinets,\r\nis decapitated--every other part, however, appears to be in a good\r\nstate of preservation.\r\n\r\nThe articulations of the abdomen and tail, which cannot readily be\r\ndistinguished from each other, are seventeen in number. The middle lobe\r\nis flat, and regularly tapers to an obtuse lip; it is marked on each\r\nside with longitudinal impressed lines or little grooves. The costal\r\narches on their upper side have a deep and narrow channel, running\r\nthrough their whole course. The costal arches of the abdomen have no\r\nmembranaceous expansion beyond their terminations; this organization\r\nis only visible immediately below the end of the middle lobe, where it\r\nquickly finishes in an acute point. A large portion of the crustaceous\r\nshell remains, and is covered with distinct granulations; those on the\r\ntail are the least obvious.\r\n\r\nThis species approaches very near the A. caudatus, but the grooves on\r\nthe middle lobe, the smallness of the costal arches, and the limited\r\nextent of the membranaceous expansion round the lower portions of the\r\nshell, will sufficiently distinguish it.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens of this Asaph are in the cabinet of the Albany Institute.\r\nThe one from which our cast is taken, was found on the Helderberg\r\nmountains; it is embedded in a light grey coloured limestone shale. The\r\nother specimen, which is much smaller, was discovered near the Genessee\r\nRiver, in the State of New York. The rock in which it occurs is\r\nidentical in its constitution with the other. It contains other species\r\nof trilobites, and a number of shells.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Micrurus.[34] Cast No. 19. Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: From the Greek, for \"minute tail.\"]\r\n\r\n  Cauda attenuata, acuta; corpore valde convexo; costis striatis;\r\n  parte marginali vix membranacea.\r\n\r\nThis fine, large caudal termination of an Asaph is in the cabinet\r\nof the Albany Institute--and it is a subject of great regret, that\r\nall that has yet been discovered relating to this highly interesting\r\ntrilobite, is to be seen in this fragment.\r\n\r\nThere are eighteen articulations of the tail and abdomen, which cannot\r\nbe distinguished from each other. The middle lobe is composed of a\r\nseries of straight, distinct, parallel articulations, very convex\r\nabout the middle, so as to form a kind of longitudinal ridge down\r\nthe back. The costal arches of the lateral lobes are very distinct,\r\nand are longitudinally striated or grooved on their upper surface,\r\nparticularly those near the upper part of the animal. The membranaceous\r\nexpansion is very narrow along the sides of the body, and forms a sort\r\nof hem; below the central portion of the tail it makes a short acute\r\nprojection, which seems to be supported by a short costal elongation of\r\nthe middle lobe. Length two inches and a half.\r\n\r\nThe A. Micrurus was found in the black fœtid limestone of Trenton\r\nFalls, by M. H. Webster, Esq., and by him placed in the rich collection\r\nof trilobites in the Albany Institute. The limestone in which this\r\nAsaph is embedded, is almost one entire mass of petrifactions. The\r\ngeneral aspect of the A. Micrurus is very similar to that of a\r\ncalymene--but judging from its structure, it could never contract\r\nits shell into a spherical figure. Its minute tail, and narrow\r\nmembranaceous expansion round the terminal edges of the lateral lobes\r\nare quite peculiar, and determine it to be an Asaph.\r\n\r\n\r\nAsaphus Wetherilli.[35] _Green._ Cast No. 20.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: I have named this species in compliment to my friend,\r\nJohn P. Wetherill, Esq., whose magnificent cabinet of fossils in the\r\nAcademy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia, will ever remain as a\r\nmonument of his discrimination, enterprise, and liberality.]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo postice arcuato, sulcato; abdominis articulis duodecim;\r\n  cauda vix membranacea; cute coreacea vix punctata.\r\n\r\nThe contour of this beautiful Asaph is very regularly ovate; unlike\r\nmost of the remains of this genus, the buckler is still attached\r\nto the abdomen, though one of the _cheeks_, and a portion of the\r\n_front_ are obscured by the rock in which the animal is imbedded. The\r\ncheeks form spherical triangles. The oculiferous tubercles, though a\r\ngood deal defaced, seem to have been circular and not lunate, as in\r\nthe A. Caudatus. A raised, curved line passes from and over the eye,\r\nbetween it and the lateral lobe of the abdomen. The central lobe of\r\nthe back is composed of twelve double joints, and that of the tail of\r\nsix single articulations; where the epidermis or shell is perfect,\r\nall the articulations appear single. The last joint of the tail is\r\nlonger than in any other of our species. The ribs of the abdomen are\r\nrather broad, and have a deep furrow scooped out along their upper\r\nsurface; their extremities, where they can be discovered, are detached\r\nfrom each other, and terminate in reflected points, like those of the\r\nA. Limulurus. The costal arches of the tail are delicately grooved,\r\nand terminate in the membrane. The membranaceous expansion round the\r\nedge of the tail is very narrow, and appears to form no projection\r\nbeyond its central part. The whole epidermis is finely marked with\r\ngranulations. Length one inch and three-fourths--breadth one inch and\r\none-fourth.\r\n\r\nThis interesting species was found in limestone shale, near Rochester,\r\nin Munroe County, N. Y.; and is now in the valuable cabinet of the\r\nAlbany Institute. An accidental fissure of the rock disclosed not only\r\na fine specimen of both the mould and the cast of this animal, but\r\nalso another individual of the same species in contact with it. From\r\nthe peculiar attitude which these fossilized animals maintain towards\r\neach other, they appear to have been combatants at the very moment when\r\nthe catastrophe occurred which produced their mineralization. In the\r\nMuseum of the Garden of Plants at Paris, there is a large specimen of\r\ntwo fossil fish, which are supposed by many to have been destroyed and\r\ncovered with mineral matter, when one of them was in the very act of\r\nswallowing the other. Mr. Bake well, however, who accurately examined\r\nthis specimen, is of opinion, that the two heads of the fish had been\r\npressed together by the superincumbent weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Paradoxides. _Brongniart._\r\n\r\nThe animals arranged under this generic name, include the organic\r\nremains described by Linné as Entomolithus paradoxus, and Brongniart\r\nhas given the specific appellation which the great Swedish naturalist\r\napplied to these singular animals, out of compliment to him, though he\r\nconsiders it quite inappropriate. The late Professor Dalman calls this\r\ngenus Olenus, and quotes Paradoxides as a synonyme, but the term of\r\nBrongniart seems to have the priority, and therefore must be preferred.\r\n\r\nThe animals belonging to the Paradoxides have the body very much\r\ndepressed, and the lateral much wider than the middle lobe.\r\n\r\nThe buckler is nearly semicircular, the cheeks are destitute of eyes,\r\nand the front is marked with three transverse furrows. This last\r\ncharacter is probably not a permanent one.\r\n\r\nBut the most distinguishing character, is the prolongation of the\r\ncostal arches, particularly those of the tail, beyond the membrane\r\nwhich they are supposed to support; the termination of these arches\r\nis in teeth or spines. Some species of the Asaph have prolongated\r\nextremities to the ribs of the abdomen, but we have never seen them on\r\nthe arches of the tail.\r\n\r\nThis genus is said to comprise a great number of species, but the only\r\none found in North America, as far as our knowledge extends, is that\r\ndescribed by J. J. Bigsby, in the fourth volume of the Journal of the\r\nAcademy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia. As we have not seen the\r\nspecimen, we add the description of it in the author's own words.\r\n\r\n\r\nParadoxides Boltoni. _Bigsby._ Figure 5.\r\n\r\nOval, blind; surface with small tubercles and striæ; clypeus rounded\r\nbefore; exterior angle extending in a broad spine; abdomen fourteen\r\njointed; segments recurved, falcate; tail membranaceous and serrate.\r\n\r\nThe shape of this individual is oval, approaching ovate; it is\r\nmoderately flat; the whole length is five inches and four-fifths; its\r\nbreadth across the middle is four inches and nine-tenths; wherever the\r\ncutis is not removed, it is covered profusely and irregularly with\r\nsmall tubercles. The denuded portions in this specimen, for the space\r\nof three quarters of an inch from the external margin, is, in a very\r\nsmall degree, depressed, and displays a number of broken and continuous\r\nstriæ, parallel to that margin. There are no traces of organs of\r\nvision. The buckler is nearly the segment of a circle; anterior edge,\r\nin the present case, imperfect; it is four inches and three-fifths\r\nbroad, and one inch and one-ninth long at the centre; it joins the\r\nabdomen by a somewhat sinuous transverse line; cheeks and front of\r\nequal breadth; the former are flat, but rise at the sharp ridge by\r\nwhich they unite with the front; they are triangular in shape; their\r\nouter angles terminating by an acute tip. The striæ mentioned above\r\nare here not quite parallel to the external border; the front is a\r\nshallow depression; rounded but tapering anteriorly; it is intersected\r\nfrom above on each side obliquely towards the mesial line, by a ridge\r\nbifurcating downwards; another smaller ridge nearly bisects the front\r\nperpendicularly.\r\n\r\nThe abdomen and post abdomen are not distinct. The abdomen exclusive\r\nof the cauda is three inches and a half long; it exhibits fourteen\r\ncostæ varying indiscriminately from one-fifth to one-fourth of an inch\r\nin breadth, except the three inferior ones, which are rather broader;\r\nthey occupy the whole abdomen without membranous interspaces, and are\r\nseparated by a black sulcus, not always well defined, and sometimes a\r\nline in diameter. Each costa is canaliculated from the upper and under\r\nangle to the tip.\r\n\r\nThe middle lobe is separated from the lateral by a shallow, rude\r\nsulcus, which however, does not always destroy the continuity of the\r\ncostæ, as they cross it; this lobe is slightly convex, one inch and\r\na half broad at the top, and so continues to the sixth costa, after\r\nwhich it gradually contracts, until at the bottom it is one-fifth of\r\nan inch broad, subsiding insensibly into a flat membrane-like surface;\r\nits longitudinal sulci pass one inch farther downwards, and expanding\r\na little, unite with the costæ on each side the posterior edge of the\r\nspace included by them, being dentated.\r\n\r\nThe lateral lobes are quite flat, one inch and a half broad anteriorly,\r\nand, by gradual prolongation, become at the fourth costa one inch and\r\nfour-fifths in breadth; this dimension is maintained to the ninth\r\narticulation, when it slowly decreases to one inch at the bottom;\r\nthe recurvature of the costæ is gentle in the upper eight, but then\r\ndecreases rapidly. Their extremities, advancing two-fifths and\r\nfour-fifths of an inch into the embedding rock, are falcate with their\r\nraised black edges, and clearly marked points.\r\n\r\nThis trilobite was found by Lieut. Bolton, at Lockport, in the state\r\nof New York, in the black, shaly, horizontal limestone forming the\r\nlower part of the ravine by which the Erie canal ascends the _parallel\r\nridge_ of Lake Ontario. Dr. Bigsby remarks on this locality, \"I am not\r\nprepared to assign to this limestone its exact place in the series\r\nof geological formations; it is above the saliferous sandstone, and\r\ntherefore more recent than the rocks best known as abounding in\r\ntrilobites.\" We have, therefore, in this instance, another fact, which\r\ndemonstrates that blind trilobites are not confined to a geological\r\nperiod more remote than That which has produced the animals with\r\noculiferous tubercles.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Ogygia. _Brongniart._\r\n\r\nIn the vast quarries of slate at Angers, in France, there is frequently\r\nnoticed two very remarkable organic remains, which have for a long\r\ntime excited the attention of naturalists. To receive these curious\r\nrelics, Professor Brongniart established the genus, Ogygia, which he\r\nthus characterizes. Body much depressed--elongated into an ellipse,\r\nterminated in points--nearly equal at its extremities, and not capable\r\nof contracting itself into a spherical form. The buckler is bordered by\r\na slight longitudinal furrow, rising from its anterior extremity, and\r\nits posterior angles terminating in elongated points. The abdomen has\r\neight articulations, and its longitudinal lobes are not very prominent.\r\nThe eyes are neither prominent nor reticulated and there are no other\r\nprotuberances on the buckler.\r\n\r\nIn Professor Brongniart's original work on the Trilobites, he has\r\ndescribed the two specimens from Angers, under the specific names\r\nof Guettardi, and Desmarestii, in compliment to M. M. Guettard and\r\nDesmarest; and in De La Beche's Manual of Geology, we are informed that\r\nhe has since identified two other species; one of which is supposed to\r\nbe found in North America; this he calls _Ogygia Sillimani_; the banks\r\nof the Mohawk River, near Schenectady, is the locality from which it\r\nis said to have been derived.\r\n\r\nAs we have not been able to find any detailed account of this species,\r\nwe have admitted both it and the genus to which it is said to belong\r\ninto our Monograph exclusively on the high authority of Professor\r\nBrongniart, as quoted in the Manual of Geology. We are not ignorant of\r\nthe species of Trilobites found near Schenectady, and if permitted to\r\noffer a suggestion on this subject, it would be, that the description\r\nof the American ogygia, was made out by its distinguished author from\r\nthe fragment of an Isotelus. The Isotelus is not uncommon in that\r\nvicinity, and one of its extremities might, even by a very close\r\nobserver, be mistaken for that of an Ogygia--especially by those who\r\nare not perfectly familiar with the Isotelus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Isotelus. _Dekay._\r\n\r\nThis fine genus of trilobites was established November, 1824, by my\r\nfriend James E. Dekay, M. D. It embraces a considerable number of\r\nspecies so analogous to each other, that except in a very few cases,\r\nit is exceedingly difficult to point out their distinctive characters.\r\nSome of the species of Isotelus, appear to have reached a greater size\r\nthan any other trilobite. In the cabinet of P. A. Browne, Esq., there\r\nis the fragment of one, which must have been fourteen or fifteen inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe Isotelus is found in several parts of North America, but most\r\nabundantly in the black transition limestone, in the northern section\r\nof the country. The richest locality, not only of this genus, but also\r\nof the Calymene and the Asaph, is Trenton Falls, on West Canada Creek,\r\nabout 13 miles to the north of Utica, in the state of New York. The\r\nfollowing extracts from the notes of Professor Renwick, which accompany\r\nDr. Dekay's account of the Isotelus, will give some idea of this vast\r\ndepository of the medals of ancient zoology. West Canada Creek, is one\r\nof the principal branches of the Mohawk River. At Trenton Falls it has\r\nworn itself a passage through the rock for the distance of nearly two\r\nmiles, forming a series of water falls; and has thus laid open to view\r\nthe strata to the depth of probably 300 feet. The layers of the rock\r\nthus disclosed are nearly horizontal, and of various thicknesses: they\r\nare composed of limestone, with the exception of numerous thin veins\r\nof argillaceous matter. The higher strata are composed of carbonate of\r\nlime nearly pure, of a light grey colour and crystalline structure. At\r\ngreater depths it is more compact and darker in colour, and finally it\r\nappears quite black and highly fœtid.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: See Annals of N. Y. Lyceum, vol. i. page 185.]\r\n\r\nAnimal remains are contained in every part of the rock; besides several\r\ngenera of trilobites, we have several species of orthocera. Encrinites\r\nand Fungites--Nautili--Terebratulæ and Producti, are quite common.\r\nThe favosites here are sometimes six inches in diameter, and in such\r\nnumerous columns, as to have induced the late worthy proprietor of\r\nthis interesting spot, Mr. J. Sherman, to consider them as analogous\r\nin structure to the basaltic columns of Staffa and the Giant's\r\nCauseway; he therefore maintains the extravagant theory that these\r\ncolumns are nothing more than gigantic favosites.[37] We visited this\r\nfamous locality of trilobites not long since, and were almost as much\r\ndelighted with the sublimity and grandeur of the cataract, and the\r\npicturesque and romantic character of the glen, as with the reliques of\r\nolden times, which are scattered here in such profusion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: See a Description of Trenton Falls, by John Sherman, p.\r\n17.]\r\n\r\nThe genus Isotelus, derived from Ἱσος, equal, and τελος, extremity, is\r\nthus characterized by Dr. Dekay.\r\n\r\n_Body_ oval often contracted, not unfrequently extended.\r\n\r\n_Head_ or buckler large and rounded, equalling the tail in size, but\r\nwith two oculiform tubercles.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_ with eight articulations.\r\n\r\nFrontal process beneath, with two semilunar terminations.\r\n\r\n_Post abdomen_ or tail, broad, expanded with indistinct divisions, as\r\nlarge as the buckler.\r\n\r\nLongitudinal lobes very distinct.\r\n\r\nOther distinguishing marks by which this genus may be known, have been\r\ngiven in our introduction.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsotelus Gigas. _Dekay_. Casts Nos. 21 and 22.\r\n\r\n_Head_ representing a spherical triangle, surface punctate, convex,\r\ndescending from between the eyes to the anterior border, which has\r\na narrow raised rim; posterior extremity concave and corresponding\r\nto the articulation of the abdomen. Eyes elevated, prominent,\r\nsub-pedunculated; cornea oblong, lunated, highly polished; _abdomen_\r\nwith eight distinct articulations, the middle lobe double the size\r\nof the lateral one: these latter are continuous with the middle\r\nlobe, have a deep furrow impressed on their upper surfaces, which\r\nbecomes gradually effaced towards their narrow free extremities.\r\nThese lateral lobes are rounded at their extremities, and flattened\r\nin such a manner as to allow each lobe to slide easily under the lobe\r\nimmediately preceding. _Tail_ subtriangular, convex, equalling the\r\nhead in size, with the posterior termination rounded. On the centre of\r\nits surface, when accidentally decorticated, a slight elevation may be\r\ntraced, if the specimen be held in a certain light, which appears to\r\nbe a continuation of the middle lobe; this extends to within a short\r\ndistance of the posterior angle of the tail, when it is either entirely\r\neffaced or terminates in an abrupt truncation. Another elevation runs\r\nparallel to and at a short distance from the edge of the tail. These\r\nelevations are connected by obscure parallel lines, imitating the\r\nspaces between the lateral lobes. When the tail is fractured on the\r\nborders, a semilunar depression is visible, exhibiting concentric\r\nstriæ. The whole Surface of the animal has a jet black polish. Length\r\nfrom 6 to 12 inches.\r\n\r\nThe original of our cast is in the cabinet of J. P. Wetherill, and was\r\nfound near Cincinnati, Ohio. It is of a yellowish colour, and occurs in\r\nargillaceous slate. Specimens are common in most cabinets of American\r\nfossils. The Lyceum in New York, possesses a fragment of an individual\r\nof this species, which must have been at least 17 inches long. Our\r\ncast, No. 22, is from the gigantic tail in the cabinet of P. A. Brown,\r\nEsq. Mr. Stokes describes the I. gigas as a new species under the name\r\nof Asaphus Platycephalus, in Geolog. Trans. vol. i. N. Series. His\r\nspecimen was found in the limestone of. St. Joseph's, Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsotelus Planus.[38] _Dekay._ Cast No. 23.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The general usage of naturalists is to prefix a short\r\nLatin caption to the species which they discover--but as some\r\nauthors do not follow this fashion, we are satisfied to suffer their\r\ndescriptions to stand without it. We believe, indeed, that the time is\r\nnot very distant, when every author will be expected to publish his\r\ndiscoveries in his vernacular tongue.]\r\n\r\n_Head_ more rounded than the preceding, and less elevated. _Tail_\r\nflat, rounded. Total length two inches and one-tenth. Breadth one\r\ninch and one-tenth. Length of the head, six-tenths--of the abdomen,\r\neight-tenths, and of the tail seven-tenths.\r\n\r\nDr. Dekay is of opinion that this species may possibly prove to be the\r\nyoung of the preceding. The relative proportions of its buckler and\r\ntail vary considerably from those of the I. gigas; and the depth of\r\nthe lateral lobes, which exceeds three-tenths of an inch, would almost\r\nof itself determine it to be a new species. The original, from which\r\nour cast was taken, is in the cabinet of J. P. Wetherill. It was found\r\nnear Newport, Kentucky, and occurs in argillaceous slate. The fossil is\r\nof a dirty yellow colour.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsotelus Cyclops.[39] _Green._ Cast No. 24. Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: From the Greek for \"round eyes,\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice attenuato, plano; oculis rotundis, proximis; cauda\r\n  ovata, acuminata.\r\n\r\nThe head of this species is much more elongated than it is in the\r\ntwo preceding species. The anterior portion of the buckler is much\r\nprolonged. The eyes are approximate, rounded, and near the posterior\r\nedge of the head. The abdomen is furnished with eight distinct\r\narticulations; the middle lobe is scarcely broader than the lateral\r\nlobes; tail rather broader than the head, and ovate; posterior\r\ntermination more rounded than the buckler. Length nearly three inches.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from which our model was taken belongs to the Albany\r\nMuseum. No label is attached to it, but I was informed by Mr. Meach,\r\none of the proprietors, that it was found in the western part of the\r\nState of New York. It is embedded in an ash-coloured limestone. The\r\nspecimen is a good deal worn--but the peculiar form of the eyes, and\r\nthe narrowness of the middle abdominal lobe, clearly distinguish it\r\nfrom either of Dr. Dekay's species.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsotelus Megalops.[40] _Green._ Cast No. 25.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: From the Greek for \"great eyes.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice subrotundato, postice arcuato; oculis magnis,\r\n  rotundis, eminentissimis; cauda suborbiculari, limbo lato;\r\n  articulis abdominis octo.\r\n\r\nThe buckler in its contour resembles very much the head of the I.\r\ngigas; it is, however, rather more rounded before, and arcuated behind.\r\nThe oculiferous tubercles, are very peculiar, being very large, round,\r\nand exceedingly prominent. They have a good deal the appearance of\r\nsolid hemispheres placed on the forehead of the animal. They are\r\nexactly on a line with the two abdominal furrows. The abdomen is\r\ncomposed of eight distinct articulations; the middle lobe is rather\r\nlarger than the lateral lobes. The tail is suborbicular, convex, and\r\nrather less than the head. Length nearly five inches. Breadth almost\r\nthree inches.\r\n\r\nThis magnificent Isotelus was obtained near Trenton Falls, in New York,\r\nby P. A. Browne, Esq., and now forms a part of his fine collection\r\nof fossils, in this city. It occurs in black transition limestone.\r\nIt differs essentially from the I. gigas of Dekay, in the magnitude,\r\ncollocation, and contour of the eyes. Those of the I. gigas are oblong\r\nand lunate, and nearly half the distance between the anterior and the\r\nposterior edges of the buckler; those of the I. Megalops are not only\r\nmuch larger, but they are round, and very near the posterior border of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsotelus Stegops.[41] Green. Casts Nos. 26 and 27.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: From two Greek words, which signify \"covered eyes.\"]\r\n\r\n  Clypeo antice, caudaque postice attenuatis; cute coreacea punctis\r\n  minimis.\r\n\r\nThe head of this species is nearly in the form of a spherical triangle;\r\nits anterior edge is vertically flattened all round, but does not\r\nproduce a narrow raised rim, such as is described by Dr. Dekay, to\r\nbelong to the I. gigas. The eyes are prominent, and rather nearer the\r\nlateral edge of the buckler, than to its posterior border. The shell\r\nof the buckler forms a remarkable projection over the top of each\r\noculiferous tubercle, something like an eye-lid. Continuous with the\r\nedge of this cuticular projection, there is a curved linear depression,\r\nwhich terminates on both sides, at the edge of the buckler. This\r\nkind of suture, though remarkably developed in this species, is not\r\npeculiar to it, being more or less distinct in most of the Isoteli.\r\nThe articulations of the abdomen are lost; there can be little doubt,\r\nhowever, that they were eight in number. The tail is subtriangular, and\r\nless in magnitude than the buckler.\r\n\r\nThis fossil is among the number of fine specimens in the cabinet of\r\nJ. P. Wetherill. It is in a rolled or contracted attitude, and is\r\nsomewhat distorted. We have given, however, models of the head and\r\nthe tail, in two distinct pieces. The external shell, or calcareous\r\ncovering, is more perfect in this specimen than in any other we have\r\never seen. A considerable portion of the under side of the anterior\r\npart of the buckler, is also well preserved, and perfectly coincides\r\nwith the figure and description given of it by Dr. Dekay and Mr.\r\nStokes. There is another fragment of an Isotelus in the cabinet of Mr.\r\nWetherill, showing eight articulations of the abdomen, which probably\r\nbelongs to another individual of this species. The dorsal shell is in a\r\nhigh state of preservation. This species is embedded in clay slate, and\r\nwas found in Newport, Kentucky.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Cryptolithus. _Green._\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous organic relics embedded in black limestone at\r\nTrenton Falls, in the State of New York, there is often found the\r\nfragment of a trilobite which cannot properly be referred to any of the\r\ngenera already mentioned. Dr. J. Bigsby, in his Sketch of the Geology\r\nof the Island of Montreal, has figured and described a fossil which\r\noccurs at that place, which approaches in its specific characters to\r\nthe fragments found at Trenton--but he does not suggest for his relic\r\nany name. Professor Brongniart has also represented, plate 4, figs.\r\n5 and 7 A. B. C., the fragments of trilobites from Russia and from\r\nLlandillo, in Wales, which seem to differ but little from those above\r\nnoticed, these are also without names. Under such circumstances, we\r\nhave thought it expedient to group these relics under the generic term\r\nof Cryptolithus, a name analogous to Calymene, Asaphus, Ogygia, and\r\nAgnostus, and which may with propriety be applied to the animal, should\r\nit ever be discovered entire.[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: Since the above was written, and the C. Tessellatus\r\npublished, I have received a fine specimen of this trilobite from\r\nProfessor Eaton, in an almost perfect state, so that the entire animal\r\ncan now be described.]\r\n\r\n_Body_, contractile.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_, lunate, convex, outer edge surrounded by a semicircular,\r\nreticulated, or tessellated border.\r\n\r\n_Front_ or middle lobe of the buckler very protuberant.\r\n\r\n_Oculiferous protuberances_, none.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_, much compressed, trilobate.\r\n\r\n\r\nCryptolithus Tessellatus. _Green._ Cast No. 28, and Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n  Clypeo rotundato, fronte valde convexo, capite antice semicirculari\r\n  margine tessellato ornato.\r\n\r\nOutline of the buckler hemispherical, the edge surrounded by a\r\nsemicircular border of tessellated or rounded punctures, in three\r\nconcentric rows in front--on each side near the posterior angle of the\r\nbuckler, these rows of punctures are more numerous; the front is highly\r\nconvex; is rounded before, and gradually tapers towards the abdomen.\r\nThe cheeks form spherical triangles, and are entirely destitute of\r\noculiferous tubercles or any other markings; their posterior angles\r\nproject beyond the sides of the abdomen. Abdomen and tail very much\r\ncompressed, and composed of about ten articulations; costal arches of\r\nthe lateral lobes grooved; tail attenuated. Whole length half an inch.\r\n\r\nThe Cryptolithus Tessellatus, resembles a good deal the Entomostracites\r\nGranulatus of Wahlenberg, and which Dr. D aim an calls Asaphus\r\nGranulatus. The figure of this animal given by Brongniart, table 3,\r\nfig. 7, appears to be quite imperfect, and is very unlike, except\r\nin the buckler, the representation of Wahlenberg's fossil, given by\r\nDalman, table 2, fig. 6. Though the angles of the buckler in the\r\nAsaphus Granulatus are much more elongated than those of the C.\r\nTessellatus, it may perhaps be another species of the same genus.[43]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: The following, is Dr. Dalman's description of the Asaphus\r\nGranulatus:--\r\n\r\n  A. trunco sexarticulato pygidioque lævibus, capite antice\r\n  semicirculari margine granuloso, angulis posticis extensis corpore\r\n  longioribus.\r\n\r\n  Animalculum singulare, inversum si inspicitur, lyram forma fere\r\n  similans.

Bigsby, to which we have\r\nalready referred, seems rather different from our species. His\r\nspecimens were found at Montmorenci, near Quebec, (Canada) more than\r\nan inch and a half in diameter. The following are his remarks on this\r\ntrilobite.[44] \"The front of the buckler is remarkably convex, and has\r\non each side near the base, three very small transverse lines, scarcely\r\nto be called depressions, corresponding to the sulci so strongly marked\r\nin the genus Calymene. There is frequently, but not universally, a\r\nvery minute pisiform process on the centre of the front. The whole\r\nupper edge of the buckler is always surrounded by a very ornamental\r\nsemicircular border, sometimes semi-elliptical, of punctures placed in\r\nthe meshes of a net-work in high relief and arranged close together,\r\nin rays, passing perpendicularly from the buckler and forming at the\r\nsame time when observed transversely, curved lines parallel to its\r\nupper rim or edge, excepting at the sides, where they diverge, leaving\r\na space occupied by other lines of dottings, parallel to the former,\r\nbut speedily terminating on the cheeks of the buckler. The lines which\r\nare complete from side so side, are four in number. The imperfect\r\nadditional ones, vary from two to four; the smallest and inner,\r\nconsisting only of two or three punctures. A plain edging includes the\r\nsemicircle of punctures. In the beds of these casts, the places of\r\nthe punctures are shown by small conical elevations, and those of the\r\nridges of the net-work, by corresponding depressions.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: See Geology of the Island of Montreal, in Lyceum of Nat.\r\nHistory, N. Y. p. 214.]\r\n\r\nShould this prove to be a distinct species, we propose to call it\r\n_Cryptolithus Bigsbii_.\r\n\r\nThe _Nuttainia Concentrica_ of Professor Eaton seems also very nearly\r\nallied to this species; he describes it as having \"four or five\r\nconcentric arcs of punctures in front of the buckler, separated by\r\nalternating arcs of fine elevated ridges.\" The genus Nuttainia, to\r\nwhich he refers this species, cannot include it, and the N. Sparsa; for\r\nthese two relics have scarcely a single essential character in common;\r\nwe have, therefore, confined the genus Nuttainia, to the species which\r\nhe calls _Sparsa_.\r\n\r\nThe Cryptolithus Tessellatus is very common at Trenton falls. In the\r\ntransition limestone at Glenn's falls, in the state of New York, during\r\na very short visit to this place, Dr. R. Harlan procured a large number\r\nof this fossil, but only the buckler, the projecting front of which\r\nexhibited a pisiform protuberance above the level of the strata. Mr.\r\nEaton says that the N. Concentrica \"occurs in the wacke variety of\r\ntransition of argillite, on the Champlain canal,\" between the town of\r\nWaterford and the Mohawk river. The specimen in my cabinet, from which\r\nour cast was made, is from that place.\r\n\r\nThe Cryptolithus Tessellatus occurs also in the limestone which,\r\naccording to Dr. Bigsby, overlays the sandstone in the island of\r\nMontreal. At most of its localities, it is associated with the\r\nIsotelus, the Calymene, and with several species of Asaphus. The\r\nCryptolithus, which is entirely destitute of eyes, being thus found\r\nwith the oculiferous species, is an interesting fact, and controverts\r\nthe opinion of Professor Wahlenberg, that the trilobites, which are\r\nwithout eyes belong to a geological epoch more ancient than those which\r\nare furnished with oculiform tubercles. That organic remains furnish us\r\nwith the most satisfactory evidence of the identity or dissimilarity\r\nof certain formations, is a disputed point with some geologists[45] It\r\ncannot reasonably be doubted, that new and isolated facts have been\r\nmade the basis of a too hasty generalization. On this subject Count\r\nRasoumowsky makes the following remarks:--\"Les divers gisemens des\r\nTrilobites ne me semblent pas non plus pouvoir être déterminés avec\r\nquelque précision. M. Brongniart parait admettre que les trilobites\r\naveugles ne se trouvent que dans de tres anciennes formations dans\r\ndes schistes et des calcaires de transitions; mais nous avons donné\r\nla description d'un trilobite [without eyes] des bords de la Yaousa\r\nprés de Moscow, qui n'appartient certainement pas aux formations de\r\ntransition, ce qui me donné lieu de croire que de nouvelles recherches\r\net de nouvelles observations, prouveront qu'il n'est pas strictement\r\nvrai qu'en France, en Angleterre, en Russie, _il n'existe point de\r\ntrilobites entiérement privés d'yeux_, comme le dit le savant auteur\r\nque je viens de citer.\" See Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Vol. 8.\r\npage 195.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See Eclectic Review, for July, 1832.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Dipleura. _Green._\r\n\r\n_Body_, contractile, not much depressed, and slightly tapering.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_, pustulous, trilobate, cheeks protuberant, with oblique,\r\nannular, oculiferous tubercles.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_, with fourteen articulations, not lobate, the ribs double.\r\n\r\n_Tail_, suborbicular, not so large as the buckler, covered with an\r\nepidermis.\r\n\r\nThis genus derives its name from two Greek words, which signify\r\ndouble ribs; many of the trilobites are thus characterized; but in no\r\nspecies, is this organization so remarkable as in those which belong\r\nto the Genus Dipleura. The expansion of the tail resembles, in some\r\ndegree, that of the Isotelus, but other obvious characters sufficiently\r\ndistinguish it from that interesting genus. The fossils arranged under\r\nthis section are larger than most other trilobites.\r\n\r\n\r\nDipleura Dekayi. _Green._ Casts No. 30, 31, and Figs. 8 & 9.\r\n\r\nClypeo lunato punctato; abdomine quatuordecim articulis duplicibus vix\r\nlobatis; cauda suborbiculari; limbo lato convexo integerrimo; oculis\r\noblique deflexis.\r\n\r\nThe buckler is subtriangular, and covered with granulations; the\r\nanterior portion of our specimen being mutilated, we cannot determine\r\nits form exactly. The cheeks are very prominent, and swell up gradually\r\ntowards the oculiferous protuberances, which are oblique, and marked at\r\ntheir apex with a depression, so as to give them an annular appearance.\r\nThe abdomen is crossed by fourteen double distinct articulations,\r\nnot interrupted in their course, by the two longitudinal furrows,\r\nso common in most of the trilobites; but owing to certain curves or\r\nirregularities in the ribs near their lateral termination, a trilobate\r\nappearance may in some specimens be detected. Tail suborbicular,\r\nconvex, and covered with a thick epidermis.\r\n\r\nThe specific name of this species was given in compliment to Dr. James\r\nE. Dekay, of New York, whose valuable paper on the genus Isotelus,\r\nfirst directed my attention to the American trilobites.\r\n\r\nThe D. Dekayi has been found in several districts of the United States;\r\nat Lockport in the State of New York, it is not uncommon. The small\r\nspecimen from which our cast of the abdomen and caudal end was taken,\r\nis in the fine cabinet of Mr. William Hyde, who permitted me to use\r\nit with his wonted liberality and kindness. It is said to have been\r\nfound in Northumberland, Pennsylvania, and occurs in grey carbonate\r\nof lime. In the Philadelphia Museum, there is a fine fragment of this\r\nspecies, in which there is embedded some crystals of iron pyrites; it\r\nwas obtained in Ulster County, New York. In the cabinet of the Academy\r\nof Natural Sciences, there is a longitudinal and hollow fragment,\r\nfilled with ochre, and the oxide of iron; it is labelled from Lockport,\r\nNew York. At Mount Hope Institution, near Baltimore, there is also a\r\ngood specimen from the same locality. In the _Clinton collection_,\r\nowned by the Albany Institute, there is a large extended fragment,\r\nnearly five inches long. It is embedded in brown limestone, and was\r\nfound in Madison County, N. Y. There are twelve articulations of the\r\nabdomen remaining, and the epidermal covering of the tail is distinctly\r\nmarked with numerous dots. In the same collection there is another\r\nlarge fragment of this species, consisting of the tail and fourteen\r\narticulations. It was found in Steuben County, New York; and occurs\r\nin grey limestone. It is slightly contracted and very much depressed\r\nlaterally. There is also a head in the same kind of limestone, from\r\nCazenovia, Madison County, New York. In the cabinet of the Institute\r\nthere is another specimen of this species, about six inches in length,\r\nand nearly perfect; it is also embedded in a similar rock, and was\r\nbrought from Rochester, Munroe County, New York.\r\n\r\nThe original of the head from which our cast was made, is in the\r\ncabinet of P. A. Browne, Esq., and was found by that enterprising\r\ngeologist near Lehighton, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Trimerus.[46] _Green._\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: From the Greek for \"three divisions.\"]\r\n\r\n_Body_, contractile, tapering, compressed.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_, pustulous, indistinctly lobate, with only two small elevated\r\noculiferous tubercles.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_, with thirteen distinct, double articulations divided into\r\nthree lobes by a slight longitudinal furrow.\r\n\r\n_Flanks_, or lateral lobes, not so broad as the middle lobe.\r\n\r\n_Tail_, tapering to an obtuse point, pustulous, and marked with ten\r\narticulations.\r\n\r\nThis genus resembles in some respects both the Calymene and Dipleura.\r\nThe form of the buckler, the position and structure of the oculiferous\r\ntubercles, and the scarcely lobate divisions of the abdomen, will\r\nreadily distinguish it from the Calymenes. The articulations of the\r\ntail, not being covered with a shelly crust, is a character too obvious\r\nto confound it with the genus Dipleura. There is, we think, a beautiful\r\nchain of gradations of resemblances, between the Isotelus, Dipleura,\r\nHemicrypturus and Trimerus. The lobes of the abdomen of the Isotelus\r\nare very distinct, and the articulations of the tail are hid by a broad\r\nthick shelly crust. The lobes in the Dipleura are scarcely apparent,\r\nthe ribs more numerous; and the covering of the tail much smaller. The\r\nlobes of the Hemicrypturus are like those of the Isotelus; but the\r\nlateral ones only of the tail are covered. In the genus Trimerus the\r\nlobes are like those of Dipleura, but the articulations of the tail are\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrimerus Delphinocephalus. _Green._ Cast No. 32, and Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nClypeo semilunari, antice compresso; oculis minimis, enimentissimis;\r\narticulis duplicibus vix lobatis; cauda attenuata; corpore tuberculata.\r\n\r\nIn the rich cabinet of American fossils in the Albany Institute,\r\nthere are two fine specimens of this species, and I am indebted to\r\nthat rising and liberal institution, for the use of them in the\r\npresent work. Our cast is made from the smaller and more perfect\r\nspecimen of the two. The outline of the buckler forms an irregular\r\nsemi-ellipse. The front is convex between the eyes, and very much\r\ndepressed anteriorly, so as to form a sharp edge. The posterior part\r\nof the buckler is marked with a transverse groove parallel with the\r\narticulations of the back. The cheeks are small and triangular; the\r\nsmall elevated eye-shaped tubercles being placed in the middle, nearly\r\nequidistant from each of the angles. The eyes are not reticulated,\r\nthe summit of each tubercle only presenting a plain oval foramen. The\r\nmiddle lobe of the abdomen is much broader than the lateral lobes, and\r\nhas 13 distinct, double articulations. The side lobes are curved, and\r\neach costal arch is flattened anteriorly near their lower extremities,\r\nno doubt for the purpose of enabling the animal to roll itself into a\r\nball. The tail is tapering, and is composed of ten articulations. The\r\ncrustaceous covering is here more thickly deposited than on any other\r\npart. The entire shell seems to have been covered with minute elevated\r\ndots; these are beautifully distinct on the buckler and on the tail.\r\nWhole length of the specimen described, not quite two inches.\r\n\r\nThe other specimen of this species in the cabinet of the Albany\r\nInstitute, is a large caudal end, three inches and a half\r\nlong, entirely perfect. Both of these fossils were brought from\r\nWilliamsville, Niagara county, New York. They occur in a dark shelly\r\nlimestone, filled with other petrifactions. The calcareous matter which\r\nhas mineralized the trilobite, in this instance, as in most others, is\r\nof a much darker hue than the surrounding rock.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Ceraurus. _Green._\r\n\r\n_Body_, very much depressed, and slightly tapering.\r\n\r\n_Buckler_, scarcely trilobate; cheeks large, flat, with small remote\r\noculiform tubercles; posterior angle of the buckler spinous.\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_, with twelve articulations.\r\n\r\n_Tail_, rounded at the end, but terminating on each side with two\r\nslightly curved spines.\r\n\r\nThe name of this genus is derived from the remarkable spinous\r\nprojections from the caudal end; this peculiar organization separates\r\nit widely from the other genera. The _Paradoxides Spinulosus_ of\r\nWahlenberg, which is supposed to be the old _Entomolithus Paradoxus_\r\nof Linné, the fossil, with which all the trilobites were for a long\r\ntime confounded, has not only projecting spines from the tail, but from\r\nall the costal arches of the lateral lobes. The presence of eyes or of\r\noculiferous tubercles in the _Ceraurus_, would alone be sufficient to\r\nseparate it from the genus to which that interesting fossil belongs. In\r\nthe eighth volume of Annales des Sciences Naturelles, Count Rasoumowsky\r\nhas figured and described the fragment of a very curious relic, which\r\nseems to be an intermediate link between our genus and paradoxides; in\r\naddition to a number of filamentous elongations of the costal arches, a\r\ncurved spine seems to project from the end of the tail, as in the _A.\r\nlimulurus_. No name is given to this trilobite, which appears to have\r\nbeen found on the banks of the Yaousa, near Moscow, where it occurs in\r\nblack, coarse, argillaceous schistus. The Ceraurus is probably a very\r\nrare animal remain, as we have only met with it, in the unrivalled\r\ncabinet of trilobites belonging to the Albany Institute.\r\n\r\n\r\nCeraurus Pleurexanthemus. _Green._ Cast No. 33. Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n  Clypeo postice arcuato, angulo externo in mucronem valde producto;\r\n  oculis minimis remotis, postabdomine in spinam arcuatam acutam\r\n  utrinque extenso.\r\n\r\nThe exact contour of this species cannot be perfectly ascertained from\r\nour specimen; it seems, however, to have been lunate. The horns of the\r\ncrescent which form the posterior angles, are very distinct, and they\r\nproject like curved spines, some distance on each side of the head.\r\nThe middle lobe or front is faintly scalloped on each side along the\r\ncheeks. The cheeks are rather large, and are furnished with two small\r\noculiform tubercles, very remote from each other, and quite near to\r\nthe anterior portion of the buckler. The abdomen is composed of twelve\r\narticulations. The lateral lobes of the abdomen are flat, and each of\r\nthe ribs, at about half their extent, is marked on the upper surface,\r\nwith an elevated pimple. These little pustules are nearly on a line\r\nwith the oculiferous tubercles of the buckler, and present two parallel\r\nranges down the body, one on each side of the middle lobe, and are\r\nterminated by a curved spine, which projects to some distance beyond\r\nthe tail of the animal. Length one inch and a fourth.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable organic relic was found near Newport, in the State of\r\nNew York. It is embedded in black limestone shale, and so exceedingly\r\ndepressed is this animal, that a very thin lamen of the slate removed\r\nfrom the surface would destroy every vestige of its appearance. I am\r\nindebted to my early friend, Professor T. R. Beck, for the use of this\r\nvaluable petrifaction, which now belongs to the cabinet of the Albany\r\nInstitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Triarthrus. _Green._\r\n\r\n_Body_, slightly convex; contractile?\r\n\r\n_Buckler?_\r\n\r\n_Abdomen_, with three articulations, side lobes longitudinal, narrow,\r\nand wedge-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Tail_, broad, rounded, without any membranaceous expansion.\r\n\r\nThe name of this genus is derived from the circumstance, that the\r\nabdomen has but _three_ articulations; an organization which is very\r\npeculiar. These curious fossil animals are very abundant in the rocks\r\nin which they are found; but though I have examined a multitude of\r\nspecimens from different localities, no vestige of the head or buckler\r\ncould, on the most minute examination, be discovered. Whether these\r\nanimals, during their petrifaction, were so contorted or rolled up,\r\nas to bring the extremities of the body together, in such a manner as\r\nto present the posterior folded part only to the view; or whether the\r\nbuckler has been destroyed by the process of mineralization, as appears\r\nfrequently to happen with the asaphs, we are at a loss to determine.\r\n\r\nThe animal remains which belong to the genus Triarthrus, differ so much\r\nin their' form and general characters from all the other trilobites,\r\nthat we perhaps ought to regard them as forming another race of beings.\r\nThey are, however, more nearly allied to this family than the Agnosti\r\nof Professor Brongniart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTriarthrus Beckii. _Green._ Cast No. 34. Fig. 6.\r\n\r\n  Cauda subrotunda, bipunctata; articulis abdominis tribus, absque\r\n  lobis lateralibus consuetis, sed lobo arcuato utrinque apposito.\r\n\r\nThe only portions of this fossil which have yet been found, are the\r\nabdomen and tail. The abdomen is composed of three joints; the first\r\npasses from the side lobes completely over the body, and on its upper\r\nsurface, near the middle of the back, there is often a minute elevated\r\npimple. The other two, pass obliquely from the lateral lobes, and are\r\ninterrupted in their course over the body. The tail, or posterior\r\nportion, is expanded, something like that of the Isotelus or Dipleura,\r\nand has a deep puncture on each side, about half the distance between\r\nits terminal border and the last articulation of the abdomen. The\r\nlateral lobes are unlike those of any other genus. They form narrow\r\ncuneiform appendages to the sides; near the first joint of the abdomen\r\nthey are crossed transversely by an elevated ridge, from which they\r\ngradually taper along the sides of the body, and appear to inosculate\r\nin a delicate point at the central border of the tail. The abdominal\r\narticulations do not pass over these lobes, but just below the last\r\njoint, a little transverse furrow, in perfect specimens, may be\r\nnoticed. The largest specimen of this fragment I have seen is exactly\r\nhalf an inch in length.\r\n\r\nThis fossil occurs in black shaly limestone, on the canal near Cahooes\r\nFalls, in the State of New York, and at a number of other places in\r\nthat State.\r\n\r\nI have named this species in compliment to my early friend, Professor\r\nTheodore Romeyn Beck, M. D., well known both at home and abroad, as\r\nthe learned author of the work on Medical Jurisprudence. Some time\r\nafter commencing this little Monograph, I communicated my plan to Dr.\r\nBeck, and was surprised and gratified to find that he was also engaged\r\nwith the same inquiries, and that he was then busy in arranging and\r\nexamining the unique collection of trilobites belonging to the Albany\r\nInstitute. Without the smallest hesitation, he placed all his specimens\r\nat my disposal, and has facilitated otherwise my undertaking, by every\r\nmeans in his power.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Nuttainia. _Eaton._\r\n\r\nProfessor A. Eaton, in his Geological Text Book, has proposed the\r\nGenus Nuttainia, to include two remarkable trilobites which could not\r\nproperly be arranged in any of the previously established genera. The\r\ntwo fossils here grouped together, bear no generic relation to each\r\nother. The first species which he calls N. Concentrica, belongs to the\r\ngenus Cryptolythus, which was proposed before the appearance of his\r\nwork, and has therefore been noticed in another place.\r\n\r\nThe genus Nuttainia is thus characterized by its author: \"Head in\r\nthree lobes, the middle one most prominent; the two lateral lobes\r\nsub-hemispherical, or sub-quadrantal; the whole head bordered\r\nanteriorly with a punctured fillet; body distinctly three lobed, middle\r\nlobe sub-cylindric, and not so broad as the side lobes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNuttainia Sparsa. _Eaton._ Cast No. 35.\r\n\r\nFillet nearly straight in front of the middle lobe of the head,\r\npunctures of the fillet scattered irregularly, without any alternating\r\nridges; head compressed, covered with scattered punctures, having its\r\nside lobes much smaller than the middle one; middle lobe with straight\r\nsides, giving it somewhat the form of a parallelogram.\r\n\r\nFound in third grauwacke,[47] or grit slate in Coeymans, sixteen miles\r\nsouth-west of Albany. I have the head of one before me two and a half\r\ninches broad, and one and a half long. The whole of the animal must\r\nhave been six or seven inches in length.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: In a manuscript note, Professor Eaton states that the\r\nthird grauwacke, or grit slate of Coeymans, \"_alternates_ with the\r\nunderlaying cherty lime rock.\" This opinion some of our geological\r\nfriends, familiar with the formation at Coeymans, and with the\r\nProfessor's nomenclature of rocks, have called in question.]\r\n\r\nThe above account is copied from the \"Text Book.\" Mr. Eaton was kind\r\nenough to lend me the only specimen of this curious fossil remain,\r\nwhich has yet been found; from which his description was taken, and of\r\nwhich our cast is an exact copy. His generic characters do not in our\r\nopinion at all apply to this fragment. Nothing but the head of this\r\nsingular trilobite remains, and it is doubtful whether what is said\r\nto be the punctured fillet, \"nearly straight in _front_ of the middle\r\nlobe,\" be not the commencement of the articulations of the abdomen. The\r\nwhole fragment looks very much like the head of some large Asaph or\r\nOgygia.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenus Brongniatia. _Eaton._\r\n\r\nProfessor Eaton has proposed the name Brongniatia (Brongniartia?) for a\r\ngenus of trilobites, which we think he has not defined with sufficient\r\naccuracy to be of any practical use. The _Isotelus gigas_ of Dr. Dekay,\r\nwhich has been for a long time so well established, is here ranked\r\nmerely as a species under the name of B. isotela. The relic which we\r\ndescribed before the Geological Text Book appeared as the _Triarthrus\r\nBeckii_, forms the species B. carcinodea--and the trilobite which is\r\nsupposed to be the Asaphus platycephalus of Stokes, is the only other\r\nspecies mentioned. The A. platycephalus,[48] we know to be identical\r\nwith the I. gigas, and as the animal remain described by Mr. Eaton\r\nis entirely different from Dr. Dekay's fine species, we subjoin the\r\naccount given in the \"Text Book.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: For a figure and description of the Asaphus\r\nPlatycephalus, by Mr. Stokes, see Transactions of the Geological\r\nSociety. Second Series, vol. i.]\r\n\r\nGenus Brongniatia--Fore abdomen always, and post abdomen in some\r\ncases, longitudinally divided into three lobes, by regular series of\r\nundulations traversing the joints, without grooves; articulations of\r\nthe side lobes being manifest continuations of those of the middle\r\nlobe, and consequently, agreeing in number.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrongniatia Platycephala. _Eaton._\r\n\r\nHead and fore abdomen very broad and depressed, the abdomen with ten\r\njoints curved forwards at the undulations; post abdomen and tail with\r\nabout fifteen joints curved backwards at the undulations; the three\r\nlobes of the tail more distinctly separated; divisions between the\r\njoints of the abdomen double.\r\n\r\nThe representation of B. platycephala, figure 20, plate 2, of the\r\nGeological Text Book, if it be accurately drawn, is certainly of a\r\ntrilobite never before described. On the buckler, which is without\r\neyes, there is delineated a figure, not unlike some of the leaves of\r\nthe mulberry tree.\r\n\r\nThe tail is also very peculiar. In Silliman's Journal, Volume 21st,\r\npage 136, Professor Eaton proposed for this curious fossil the\r\ntemporary name of Ogygies latissimus. It is found, he observes, \"in the\r\nupper soft slaty variety of the rock which has been so successfully\r\nused for the lias cement at Chitteningo, &c. Dr Smith, of Lockport,\r\n(N. Y.) sent me two specimens, taken from a continuation of the\r\nChitteningo lias rock, immediately beneath the geodiferous lime rock\r\non which the cherty (cornitiferous) reposes.\" The whole animal is six\r\ninches long, and three broad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNature of the Trilobite.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery one familiar with the history of the Trilobites, is aware that\r\na good deal of controversy has existed among naturalists, respecting\r\nthe precise link in the grand chain of organized beings, these\r\nsingular fossil animals, should occupy. Professor Brongniart, Dr.\r\nDekay, Audoúin, and several other acute observers, have placed them\r\nin the vicinity of the Limuli, and other Entomostraca with numerous\r\nfeet; while P. A. Latreille and others, presuming that these animals\r\nwere destitute of locomotive organs, as no vestige of them has ever\r\nbeen discovered, fix their natural position in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Chitones; or rather that they constituted the original stock of\r\nthe Articulata, being connected on the one hand with these latter\r\nMollusca, and on the other with those first mentioned, and even\r\nwith the Glomeris.[49] It was our original intention to have closed\r\nthis Monograph with a short history of these theories--and of the\r\nnotion advanced by Latreille and others, that the Trilobites have\r\nbeen annihilated by some ancient revolution of our planet. All these\r\nmatters, we think, are now put to rest by the late discovery of some\r\nliving Trilobites in the southern seas, near the Falkland Islands. In\r\nthe cabinet of the Albany Institute, we have examined some of these\r\nrecent animals, which have very nearly the size and general appearance\r\nof the Paradoxides Boltoni, as represented on our frontispiece; the\r\nspecies cannot, however, belong to that genus, as the buckler is\r\nfurnished with eyes very similar to those of the Calymene Bufo; its\r\norgans of locomotion are short, numerous, and concealed under the\r\nshell--but I do not feel at liberty to notice the interesting animal\r\nmore minutely. It will probably be described and figured shortly, in\r\na perfectly full and satisfactory manner, by Dr. James Eights, the\r\nenterprising discoverer, together with several other new and remarkable\r\ngenera and species belonging to the Entomostraca.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: See Cuvier's Animal Kingdom, vol. iii. pp. 135-6.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       Index to the Species.\r\n                             ————\r\n\r\n            CALYMENE Blumenbachii,           page 28\r\n                     Callicephala,                30\r\n                     Selenecephala,               31\r\n                     Platys,                      32\r\n                     Microps,                     34\r\n                     Anchiops,                    35\r\n                     Diops,                       37\r\n                     Macrophthalma,               39\r\n                     Bufo,                        41\r\n                     Rana,                        42\r\n            ASAPHUS  Laticostatus,                45\r\n                     Selenurus,                   46\r\n                     Limulurus,                   48\r\n                     Caudatus,                    50\r\n                     Hausmanni,                   52\r\n                     Pleuroptyx,                  55\r\n                     Micrurus,                    56\r\n                     Wetherilli,                  57\r\n            PARADOXIDES Boltoni,                  60\r\n            OGYGIA   Sillimani,                   63\r\n            ISOTELUS Gigas,                       67\r\n                     Planus,                      68\r\n                     Cyclops,                     69\r\n                     Megalops,                    70\r\n                     Stegops,                     71\r\n            CRYPTOLITHUS Tessellatus,             73\r\n                     Bigsbii,                     76\r\n            DIPLEURA Dekayi,                      79\r\n            TRIMERUS Delphinocephalus,            82\r\n            CERAURUS Pleurexanthemus,             84\r\n            TRIARTHRUS Beckii,                    87\r\n            NUTTAINIA Sparsa,                     89\r\n            BRONGNIATIA Platycephala,             91\r\n\r\n\r\n                             JOSEPH BRANO,\r\n\r\n                 No. 12, CASTLE STREET, PHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\n         _Teacher of the Art of Preparing Birds, Quadrupeds,\r\n                         Reptiles, &c. &c._\r\n\r\n                              AND OF THE\r\n\r\n            Art of making Moulds and Casts in Wax, Plaster,\r\n                           and Compositions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the casts taken from the originals of the Trilobites,\r\nhe has also a few fine casts of the bones of the Megalonix Laqueatus,\r\n_Harlan_.--Scaphites Cuvieri, _Morton_.--Mosasaurus tooth, and of\r\nseveral rare fossil American Plants;--all taken from the original\r\nfossils, in the Cabinet of the Academy of Natural Sciences, &c. &c.\r\nThese models are fac similes of the real objects, coloured according to\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAs the originals of the above are in the possession of different\r\npublic and private cabinets throughout the United States, I have at\r\ngreat trouble and expense, taken from them exact patterns, so as\r\nto accommodate museums and scientific gentlemen with them on very\r\nreasonable terms.
