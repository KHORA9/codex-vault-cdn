After some hesitation I decided to purchase a\r\npair that I happened to find mentioned in the price list of Mr. C.\r\nReiche, of Alfeld, as one of the most interesting specimens obtained\r\nduring his expedition to South Africa the year before; but I, also,\r\nfound the sensitiveness and delicacy of the jerboa very trying, for\r\nthe short journey from Alfeld to this city caused the death of the\r\nfemale and reduced her mate to such a condition that when it arrived\r\nthere seemed little hope that it could ever be utilized for scientific\r\nresearch or artistic life studies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERBOA IN THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDEN OF BERLIN.--DRAWN FROM\r\nLIFE BY G. MUTZEL.]\r\n\r\nMy anticipation and pleasure were changed to vexation and grief. The\r\nmost careful nursing--the stiff, weak little legs were dipped into and\r\nrubbed with French brandy--and a warm pen with a dry sanded floor\r\ndirectly over a heater, did their work. As the new-comer got on his\r\nfeet again my hope gained new life, and now our jerboa is my delight.\r\nIt is, indeed, a curious animal. One who saw it only in the day time\r\nasleep would scarcely know what he had before him, for he would see\r\nlittle more than a mass of soft, bright sandy hair. The coming of the\r\nkeeper with the dish of food and the unfastening of the door of the\r\ncage bring life to the ball of hair in the corner; a part of it is\r\nunrolled and the long, black-tipped tail with two lines of hair is\r\nlaid out on the ground, and then on each side of it a leg is run out\r\nwhich is nearly as long as the tail and is provided with blunt,\r\nsmooth, hoof-life nails; and, finally, the head and body are\r\ndistinguishable and the animal stretches out comfortably on its back\r\nin the sand. The fine-skinned, hairless ears still hang limp, the eyes\r\nare half closed and the short fore legs are crossed under the chin.\r\n\r\nBut now the animal gets on its legs by an elastic swing, and its ears\r\nare raised and its eyes wide open, so that we can see that the latter\r\nare large and dark, with long eyelashes. Then the jerboa raises\r\nhimself to his full height and playfully measures his cage by one\r\nbound from corner to corner. Soon after, the fresh food receives due\r\nattention, the animal either jumping toward it in rabbit fashion or\r\ncrawling slowly on all fours. When it has reached its goal it again\r\nassumes the upright position, in which it is evidently most\r\ncomfortable, and begins to eat it in his own peculiar way; that is,\r\nsitting on his hind legs he quickly seizes a piece of bread, turnip or\r\nother food in his fore paws and conveys it to his mouth, apparently\r\nindifferent to the nature of the food before him. He never takes\r\nanything directly in his mouth; even the grass on a piece of turf that\r\nI had given to him as an experiment was not eaten as it would have\r\nbeen eaten by other animals, but was first plucked with the fore paws.\r\nIf we notice the position of the mouth, far back on the under side of\r\nthe head, we will understand that the jerboa could not take his food\r\nin any other way. Besides this, nothing of special interest has been\r\nobserved in this nocturnal creature, but he, of course, lives more\r\nregularly and quietly than if his mate had lived.\r\n\r\nOne who knows anything about the structure of animals' bodies need not\r\nbe told that the jerboa is a rodent. One glance at the peculiar shape\r\nof his head would assure him of that. The form of the rest of its\r\nbody, especially its long hind and short fore legs, give unmistakable\r\nproof that it is related to the jumping rodents; it belongs, in a wide\r\nsense, to the family of the jumping mouse, the scientific name\r\n(Dipodidea, two-footed) of which is very significant, as the very\r\nshort fore legs are usually carried close under the chin and are\r\nscarcely noticeable when the animal is in its normal position, and are\r\nof little use when it moves about. The hind legs are very strong, and\r\nwhen going at full speed the jerboa takes jumps that measure from\r\neight to ten yards, according to the unanimous testimony of various\r\nwitnesses.\r\n\r\nThe jumping mouse of North America, which is somewhat larger than an\r\nordinary mouse, is, according to Brehm, also as swift as an arrow or a\r\nlow-flying bird. This exceptional velocity is not all that reminds us\r\nof a bird, for there is also a strong resemblance in the formation of\r\ncertain parts of the bodies of the two creatures; but, after\r\nconsideration, this should not seem strange, because in animal\r\norganisms similar means are employed to accomplish similar ends. It is\r\nonly natural that there should be peculiarities in the construction of\r\nthe limbs and skulls of the Dipodidea with their bird-like movements\r\nand bird-like sharp-sightedness, that are usually found only among\r\nbirds. The consistency between the construction of their bodies and\r\ntheir mode of life is a beautiful example of fitness; only by\r\nextraordinary quickness of movement and sagacity could the little\r\ndefenseless plant-eaters maintain the struggle for existence in the\r\nbarren steppes and deserts. The formation of the bodies of the\r\ndifferent members of the family varies according to their needs. The\r\njerboa is the largest member of the family. Very little is known of\r\nhis life when free; it being known only that the jerboas are widely\r\nspread over the whole of southern Africa, and are nocturnal burrowers\r\nof the steppes. During the rainy season they remain in a sort of\r\nwinter sleep.--_Dr. L. Heck, in the Illustrirte Zeitung_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE LANGUAGE OF ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nBy M. DE LACAZE DUTHIERS, of the Institute of France.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had occasion in a note published several years ago in the _Revue\r\nScientifique_ to mention a parroquet which I have since continued to\r\nobserve, the manifestations of whose intelligence are both interesting\r\nand instructive. Many acts of birds are difficult of interpretation.\r\nTo speak only of their songs, the meanings of most of the innumerable\r\nvarieties of sounds which they produce, and of their diverse\r\nwarblings, escape us completely. It is not possible to find the\r\nmeaning of these things except by forming suppositions and hypotheses,\r\nor by catching the connections between cries and acts. But instances\r\nof the latter kind are extremely rare in comparison with the great\r\nmajority of the manifestations made by animals.\r\n\r\nThus, to select examples which every one can observe, when a canary\r\nbird is warbling in its cage and becomes deafening, or when a lark\r\nrises straight up in the air and _incantat suum tirile tirile_--sings\r\nits _tirile tirile_--as Linnæus picturesquely expresses it; when a\r\ntomtit, leaping from branch to branch of a willow or among the reeds,\r\nrepeats its florid warblings; when a raven croaks; when a blackbird\r\nwhistles--what significance can we attach to their songs and their\r\ncries? Certainty is impossible, and we can only form more or less\r\nplausible hypotheses concerning the interpretation of them.\r\n\r\nThe parrot furnishes us one more aid in this matter than other birds,\r\nand this helps us, to a certain extent, in overcoming the difficulty\r\nof interpretation. It has an articulate voice, and when we have taught\r\nit a few words, the meaning which it gives them may be better divined\r\nby us according to the tone and the rapidity or slowness of its\r\nutterance. This permits us to discover the feelings that move it, for\r\nwe can better judge from an articulate sound than from one that is\r\nmerely musical.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the language of animals. It is neither my\r\ndesire nor my intention to repeat here all that may have been said on\r\nthis subject. It would take too long and would be of no use. I have\r\noften witnessed facts that may be of interest to those who are\r\noccupied with the mental manifestations of animals. I will simply\r\nrelate them; and of such as are already known, I will merely mention\r\nthem anew, admitting in advance a priority for others which I do not\r\ndemand for myself.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that animals communicate their impressions by an\r\ninarticulate voice. Common sense and the most superficial observations\r\nare opposed to the negative of this proposition. But when a canary\r\nbird warbles till it stuns us, or a nightingale sings in the shadows\r\non the fine nights of June, can we follow and discover the\r\nsignificance of those modulations--now sharply cadenced, now slowly\r\ndrawn out, and ending with a trill long and accurate enough to\r\nchallenge the most skillful musician?\r\n\r\nAll the poets of every country have constantly sung of the songs of\r\nPhilomela. But their fervent and enthusiastic verses cast little light\r\non the value of the nightingale's song. It is said that the male sings\r\nfor the entertainment of the sitting female, but there is no proof of\r\nthe assertion. The note warning of the approach of danger is easier to\r\nrecognize. The bird utters a short, hoarse cry, and repeats it with a\r\nsuccession of _trrre, trrre_, which is impossible to mistake. When we\r\nhear this cry we may be sure that an enemy is near. Music gives way to\r\na cry of distress and warning, and the female leaves her nest if the\r\nsounds become piercing. What do we know of the gobbling of the turkey,\r\nwhich the whistling and the cries of children excite? They are\r\ndoubtless responses to those challenges; but what do they mean?\r\n\r\nThe crowing of the cock, recurring regularly at fixed hours, has some\r\nsignification, but we cannot comprehend it. If on a fine afternoon in\r\nautumn the cock crows, and repeats his strain between two and four\r\no'clock, the countrymen in some places will say there will be a fog on\r\nthe morrow, and they are generally not mistaken. Hens do not mistake\r\nhis notes either; when a leader of the troop, coming upon a spot rich\r\nin food, utters his peculiar chuckle, they run from all around to\r\nshare the find with him. It is evident that the cock has called them\r\nand they have understood him. These facts indicate that there is some\r\ndefinite sense in this inarticulate language; and examples of it,\r\ntaken from other groups, might be multiplied.\r\n\r\nThe dog, intelligent animal as he is, manifests his affection on\r\nmeeting his master, with peculiar cries which vary with the intensity\r\nof his joy. No one could confound these notes of pleasure with those\r\nwhich he utters when he is angrily driving away a beggar, or when he\r\nmeets another dog of unpleasant appearance and puts himself in the\r\nposition of attack.\r\n\r\nAn interesting study of the voice of the dog on guard may be made in\r\nthe country at night. If another dog barks in the distance, the house\r\ndog answers in a peculiar manner. He gives a few growls, stops, seems\r\nto listen, begins again, very often getting answers; and, after two or\r\nthree interruptions, he terminates his barking with abrupt yelps, loud\r\nat the beginning and long drawn out, and gradually dying away. This\r\nending of his cries is habitually accompanied by his raising his head\r\nand throwing it back. I have often, when within the house, on hearing\r\nthe watch dog bark in this way, opened the window to assure myself on\r\nthe subject, and distinguished, as I could not do with the windows\r\nclosed, the voice of another watch dog barking in the same way in the\r\ndistance--the barkings of the two dogs alternating, one answering the\r\nother. There is in such cases an evident communication of impressions.\r\nOne of the dogs, having had his attention aroused by some unusual\r\nnoise, has transmitted his impression to the other, as sentinels\r\nposted at intervals call out theft warnings one to another. I have\r\noften repeated this observation during the long evenings of winter.\r\n\r\nAnother example, little known in thickly populated countries, is drawn\r\nfrom a curious scene which I witnessed during a winter passed in\r\nPerigord Noir. We had remarked that for several nights the three watch\r\ndogs, a young and an old male and a bitch, howled often toward\r\nmidnight, but in a peculiar way. One night in particular, during their\r\ntedious concert, just as we had got to sleep, they mingled with their\r\ncries howlings like those they would have uttered if they had been\r\nbeaten, with a shading hard to define, but which we perceived plainly;\r\nand we remarked that, leaving their kennel in the avenue that led up\r\nto the lodge, they had come to close quarters with one another at the\r\ngate, with alternating howlings and plaintive cries. Inquiring in the\r\nmorning for the cause of these singular cries, the peasants told me\r\nthat a wolf had passed, and predicted that it would return. They said,\r\ntoo, that a neighbor's hunting bitch had disappeared, and its bones\r\nhad been found in the fields near a wood. We were awakened again about\r\nmidnight by the cries of the dogs, and the scene was renewed. Informed\r\nas we now were of the nature of what was going on, we ran to one of\r\nthe windows, whence we could see, in the clear light of the moon, all\r\nthat passed. The three dogs were cowering against the gate, the oldest\r\none howling by the side of the others, while the younger one and the\r\nbitch were exposed at intervals to the attacks of another animal,\r\nbrowner than they, and of about their size, without defending\r\nthemselves, but moaning as if they were undergoing a vigorous\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\nFrightened, doubtless, by the opening of the blinds of the first story\r\nabove him, the strange animal had gone away and was sitting in the\r\nmiddle of the road. We could only see that he had straight ears. While\r\nwe were going down to get a gun the visitor came back to his charge on\r\nthe dogs, which had begun howling after he left them, and resumed the\r\ncries significant of chastisement when they were attacked again. For\r\nsome reason, perhaps because he heard the click of the gun, the foe\r\ndrew back and sat down in a garden walk, concealed by a bunch of\r\nshrubbery. The three dogs, notwithstanding our reiterated urging, were\r\nno more disposed to pursue him than before. If the assailant had been\r\na dog they would have rushed upon him, but they stayed cowering at the\r\ngate and howled distressfully. The bitch was most affected, and they\r\nall seemed paralyzed by fear. It is said in the country that bitches\r\nare especially liable to be attacked by wolves. It was so here. The\r\nmost certain feature in the matter was the terror of the animals. They\r\nwere capable of resisting the attack three times over. The young dog\r\nwas a savage one, and passers-by were afraid of the bitch; but that\r\nnight they were terrorized, and all incapable of defending themselves.\r\nTheir cries were therefore due to the same cause as in the preceding\r\nnight--the presence and attacks of the wolf. I could not have realized\r\ntheir meaning if I had not been a witness of the scene--that is, I\r\ncould not have correlated the cries and the acts.\r\n\r\nA shot at the animal behind the bushes was followed by a hoarse cry.\r\nHe was hit, and ran; but, in spite of our urgings, the dogs stayed at\r\nthe gate and only stopped howling. Under any other conditions, upon\r\nthe signal of the shot they would all have started in pursuit of the\r\nwounded animal.\r\n\r\nA wolf came to the farm during the last winter (1890-91) and attacked\r\nthe same bitch. He would have carried her off, for he had seized her\r\nby the throat, if we could judge from the stifled cries she uttered;\r\nbut this time he found with her a new watch dog--a mountain bitch from\r\nthe Pyrenees--of a breed that attacks the wolf and the bear. The wolf\r\nwould have been caught if he had not run away. He did not return, for\r\nhe had been attacked, and learned what he had to deal with.\r\n\r\nThe Pyrenean breed furnishes excellent watch dogs. I knew one of\r\nremarkable traits. At evening he would go round the house, giving two\r\nor three growls at each door. With his head raised he seemed to listen\r\nto his fine voice, then he would start again and go to another door.\r\nHe seemed desirous to show those who were observing him that he was\r\nattending to his post as guardian. He then went away in silence along\r\nthe walk, through a dark, rising hedgerow, leaping the slight hillock,\r\nyelping toward the wood. He listened, yelped again, and went in. There\r\nwas never any failure in this performance, but every evening as night\r\nwas coming on he began his round, which no one had taught him. It was\r\nall done in his function as a guard. It would be hard to determine\r\nwhat his yelps meant, but there were in them an inflection, a\r\nsonorousness, and a continuance quite different from those he uttered\r\nwhen pursuing a passer-by or when going to meet a person coming toward\r\nthe house. Every one who has a watch dog is able to tell by the sound\r\nof his barking when a person is coming up, and usually what sort of a\r\nvisitor it is.\r\n\r\nThe peasants' dogs of the southwest of France dislike the country\r\nmillers, because of the long whips which they are always carrying and\r\nsnapping, and with which the dogs, running after them, are often\r\nstruck. From as far off as the snapping of the whip can be heard, the\r\ndogs come to wait for the millers and pursue them; and it is easy to\r\nrecognize when the millers are passing, by the behavior of the dogs.\r\nThere is in this also a significance, at once aggressive and\r\ndefensive, in the cries which one can, by giving a little attention,\r\nsoon learn to distinguish.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the reality of the various meanings of the cries of\r\nthe dog under different circumstances is afforded by the companies\r\nthat collect around a female in heat.\r\n\r\nI have a very intelligent and experienced brach hound, the same which\r\nwith the bitch had to face the attack of the wolf. He amuses me much\r\nat my country lunches. Hunting dogs which have been much with their\r\nmasters at lunch do not like to have the drinking glass offered them.\r\nThis dog was much afraid of the glass, and I had only to present it to\r\nhim at lunch time to make him keep his distance. I used to keep my\r\ndoor open at lunch, for the amusement of observing how I could make\r\nhim stop exactly at the threshold without stepping over it. If he had\r\npassed over it I could always send him back by casting toward him a\r\nfew drops of water from the bottom of the glass after drinking.\r\nSitting, as was his habit, on the sill of the door, with the tip of\r\nhis muzzle never extending beyond the plane of the panels, he would\r\nfollow my motions with the closest attention, reminding me, if I\r\nfailed to give him a sign of attention, by a discreet, plaintive cry,\r\nthat he was there. But if I touched my glass, he would spring up at\r\nonce; if I filled it, he would put himself on guard, utter a kind of\r\nsigh, sneeze, lick his lips, yawn, and, shaking his ears briskly, make\r\nlittle stifled cries. Then he would grow impatient, and more and more\r\nwatchful and nervous. When I lifted my glass to my lips he would draw\r\nback, working gradually nearer to the farther door, and at last\r\ndisappear and hide. One who was looking at him without seeing me could\r\ntell by his wails and his attitude the level and position of my glass.\r\nWhen the glass was horizontal, I could see only about half of his\r\nhead, with one eye regarding me fixedly, for that was usually the\r\ncritical moment--the one, also, when the wails and restraints were\r\nmost demonstrative of the anxious fear of my poor animal.\r\n\r\nWhen we dine in the kitchen, which is on the ground floor, the dogs\r\nare usually all put out. There are four of them, three young and not\r\nexperienced, and this old, sagacious brach hound. He insists on coming\r\nin, and, to gain his purpose, tries to have the door opened. Although\r\nno person may be coming up the walk, he dashes down it barking, all\r\nthe others going along too and yelping with him; then he stops,\r\nremains a little behind after having got the others out of the way,\r\nand, turning his head from moment to moment, looks to see if the door\r\nhas been opened, for we generally go to it to see who has come. In\r\nthat case the feigned attack is successful, and the dog, who has\r\nevidently meant to give the alarm so as to have the door opened, comes\r\nin at once and claims a place at the table. He has accomplished his\r\nend, for the door is usually shut without paying attention to his\r\nhaving got in. I have frequently witnessed this stratagem, and when,\r\nduring my kitchen dinner, I suddenly hear the dogs yelping after the\r\nbrach hound has begun, I am pretty sure that nobody is in sight.\r\n\r\nI have forgotten where I found the next story of an old dog who was\r\nalso very sagacious. Hunting dogs, when they grow old, become\r\nrheumatic, or are at least debilitated with pains. We know, too, that\r\nthey crave heat, and get as near the fire as possible--a craving which\r\nincreases as they grow older. One such dog, older than the others, and\r\nslower in getting into the lodge on returning from the hunt, was often\r\ncrowded away from the fire by the other livelier dogs getting all the\r\nbest places before him. Finding himself thus turned out in the cold,\r\nhe would dash toward the door barking, when the others, supposing it\r\nwas an alarm, would rush away too, while the old rheumatic went to the\r\nfire and selected a place to suit him.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to dwell upon the intelligence shown by such acts.\r\nBut it is hardly contestable that the old animal, who knows how to\r\nplay such tricks upon his less experienced companions, deceives them\r\nby his intonations, while he is well aware that no enemy is\r\napproaching the house; but he does it scientifically, by the\r\ninflections of his voice, as a man speaking to other men would do in\r\nannouncing the arrival of an imaginary enemy.\r\n\r\nInarticulate cries are all pretty much the same to us; their\r\ninflections, duration, pitch, abruptness, and prolongation alone can\r\ninform us of their purpose. But experience and close attention have\r\nshown us the connection of these variations with the acts that\r\naccompany or precede them. Animals evidently understand these\r\ninflections at once. We cannot better compare the language of animals\r\nthan with what takes place in a pleasant sport, a kind of pantomime of\r\nthe voice or language which many youth doubtless understand, and which\r\nI venture to refer to here to aid in more easily conceiving of the\r\ncommunication of thought among animals by sounds which seem to us all\r\nalike. When I was engaged in hospitals, the evenings in the guard room\r\nwere sometimes enlivened by the presence of a companion who excelled\r\nin humorous mimicry. He would represent a man in liquor who had\r\nstopped at a fountain that flowed with a gentle sound, somewhat like\r\nthat of his own hiccough. A single oath, pronounced in different\r\ntones, was sufficient to enable us to comprehend all the impressions,\r\nall the states of mind through which this devotee of Bacchus passed.\r\nThe oath, at first pronounced slowly and with an accent expressing\r\nrelief, represented a feeling of satisfaction, with shadings of\r\nprolonged exclamation which it would be hard for one to imagine\r\nwithout suggestion. The continued flowing of the fountain made our\r\ndrunken man impatient, and he wanted it to stop. This state of mind\r\nwas translated by a new modulation of the same word. In a little while\r\nthe gurgling of the fountain produced astonishment. Was it possible\r\nthat he, with all the liquid he had imbibed, could vomit so much and\r\nfor so long a time? This mental condition was expressed by a new\r\nmodulation of the same oath. The first movement of surprise over,\r\nresignation follows, and our man decides to wait patiently for the\r\nend. A period of half lethargy was easily represented by the slowness\r\nand weakness of the man's voice while living up to this decision; but\r\nwhen he comes out of this sleepy condition and hears the fountain\r\nagain, he is possessed with fear; he cannot understand the flood he is\r\npouring out--he dares not move--he believes he is lost. Gradually the\r\nfumes of the liquor pass away, and, his mistake being recognized, the\r\ndrunkard is taken with a laughing and a gayety which are indicated by\r\nthe same oath repeated in tones corresponding with the satisfaction he\r\nis then enjoying. This making the series of impressions a man passes\r\nthrough comprehensible by a single word, varied in pronunciation and\r\nutterance, is very like the language of animals, which is always the\r\nsame, and the significance of which is given by variety of intonations\r\ncorresponding with sensational conditions.\r\n\r\nThe mewing of the cat is always the same; but what a number of mental\r\nconditions it expresses! I had a kitten whose gambols and liveliness\r\nentertained me greatly. I understood well, when it came up to me\r\nmewing, what the sound meant; sometimes the kitten wanted to come up\r\nand sleep in my lap; at other times it was asking me to play with it.\r\nWhen, at my meals, it jumped on my knees, turned round, looked at me,\r\nand spoke in a coaxing and flattering way, it was asking for something\r\nto eat. When its mother came up with a mouse in her jaws, her muffled\r\nand low-toned mew informed the little one from a distance, and caused\r\nit to spring and run up to the game that was brought to it. The cry is\r\nalways the same, but varied in the strength of the inflections and in\r\nits protraction, so as to represent the various states of mind with\r\nwhich my young animal is moved--just as it was with the drunken man in\r\nthe mimicry scene. These facts are probably well known to all\r\nobservers of animals.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that this tonality of the watch dog's cries is competent\r\nto indicate that a person is coming to the house. We find similar\r\ncries of warning uttered by birds. When I was a professor in the\r\nfaculty of Lille, I frequently visited the well known aged Professor\r\nof Physics, M. Delezenne. He had a working room at the end of a\r\ngarden, in which a laughing mew wandered. From the time that any one\r\ncame in till he went out, this bird made the vocal explosions to which\r\nit owes its name; and the good professor was certain, without ever\r\nbeing mistaken, that somebody was coming to his laboratory. He was\r\nnotified. My Jaco in Paris has a warble that answers the ringing of\r\nthe bell. If we have not heard the bell, we are notified by Jaco of\r\nits ringing, and, going to the door, find some one there. I have been\r\ntold of a parrot belonging to the steward of a lyceum which had heard\r\nthe words \"Come in,\" when any one rang the bell. He never failed to\r\ncry, \"Come in,\" when the bell moved, and the visitor was embarrassed\r\nat seeing nobody after having been invited to open the door.\r\n\r\nInstances in which the cries of birds had an incontestable and precise\r\nsignification are numerous; let me refer to a few of the best known.\r\nThe cackle of a hen, after having laid an egg and left her nest, is\r\ndecidedly characteristic. Her clucking when she is impelled to sit on\r\nher eggs, or when she is calling her chicks, is no less demonstrative.\r\nThere is not a farmer who does not recognize it and understand it. In\r\nthese things we see the relation between the tone of the prating or\r\ncluck of the hen and her acts. But when a nightingale sings all night,\r\nor a goldfinch whistles, or a raven croaks, we cannot so easily\r\ninterpret the significance of their inarticulate sounds. The finch\r\ncalls its mate by uttering a few notes followed by a long trill.\r\nMatches of a barbarous character, based on this habit, I were held in\r\nthe north of France while I was living at Lille, between 1855 and\r\n1860. I do not know whether they have been suppressed or not, but the\r\nlaws for the protection of animals ought to take cognizance of them.\r\nThe gamesters put out the eyes of the male finches, and made them,\r\nthus blinded, compete as singers, for which purpose they brought their\r\ncages into proximity. When the birds heard and recognized one\r\nanother's voices, they made their appeal to the female; the one that\r\nrenewed his amorous trills most frequently, protracted them longest\r\nand to the last, gained the prize. The bird that was declared victor\r\nreceived a medal amid the applause of a large and enthusiastic crowd;\r\nand considerable wagers were staked upon the result. I have heard that\r\nthese poor blinded birds sometimes fell down exhausted with singing,\r\nand kept on calling the absent female till they died, not being\r\nwilling to yield to a rival, who on his side was also keeping up his\r\nequally useless appeals.\r\n\r\nThese finch contests were suggested after the meaning of the song of\r\nthe birds was learned. But when these birds, which are more usually\r\nisolated--whence they have been named _Fringilla coelebs_, or\r\ncelibates--hop around our houses and also utter their amorous trills\r\nat another than the mating season, they are evidently not calling the\r\nfemale. Should we not then seek to determine by the tone whether their\r\ncall, which is always the same, is amorous or not?\r\n\r\nIn countries where flocks of turkeys are raised one can learn very\r\nquickly from their gobblings when they have captured a hare. If they\r\nmeet him standing still or lying down, they form in a circle around\r\nhim, and, putting their heads down, repeat continually their peculiar\r\ncries. The hare remains quiet, and it is sometimes possible to take\r\nhim up, terrorized as he is in the midst of the black circle of\r\ngobbling beaks and heads. The language of the turkeys is at that time\r\nincontestably significant. It is warlike, and similar to that of the\r\nmales when they are fighting. In the present instance they have joined\r\nfor war, and they make it on the frightened hare.\r\n\r\nMy Jaco, like all parrots, which are excellent imitators, pronounces a\r\nfew words and repeats them over and over again. Such birds amuse us\r\nbecause the words they know sometimes happen to be ludicrously\r\nfitting. A bird of this kind had been struck by the note sounded by\r\nthe wind blowing into a room through a crack in the glass work\r\nwhenever a certain door was opened; and he had become so perfect in\r\nhis imitation that they sometimes, on hearing the noise, went to shut\r\nthe door when it was not open.\r\n\r\nJaco formerly belonged to a very pious old lady who was accustomed to\r\nsay her litanies with another person. He had caught the words \"Pray\r\nfor us,\" in the invocations to the several saints, and said them so\r\nwell as sometimes to deceive his learned mistress, and cause her to\r\nthink she was saying her litanies with two colleagues. When Jaco was\r\nout of food, and any one passed by him, he would say, \"My poor\r\nCocotte!\" or \"My poor rat!\" in an arch, mawkish, protracted tone that\r\nindicated very clearly what he wanted, and that his drinking cup was\r\nempty. There was no doubt in the house as to his meaning; and whenever\r\none heard it he said: \"He has nothing to eat.\" He was exceedingly fond\r\nof fresh pits of apples and pears, and I was in the habit of\r\ncollecting them and keeping them to give him. So whenever, as I came\r\nnear him, I put my hand into my pocket he never failed to say: \"Poor\r\nCocco!\" in a supplicating tone which it was impossible to mistake. A\r\nsugar plum is a choice morsel to him. He can tell what it is from a\r\ndistance when I hold it out in my fingers; and when I give it to him\r\nhe cannot restrain himself if it has been any considerable time since\r\nhe has had the delicacy. Usually, after having made the first motion\r\nto get it, as if he were ravished and wanted to express his joy in\r\nadvance, he would draw back before taking it, and say, in a comical\r\ntone, \"Hold, my poor Cocotte!\" His manner of thanking in advance is\r\nlikewise amusing. The expression of his eyes and the pose of his head\r\nare all in accord with the tone of his exclamation. When he tastes the\r\nplum he utters a series of _ahs_, and produces a kind of warble by\r\nprolonging some of his notes and shortening up others. We find in\r\nthese examples, without doubt, that the articulate voice makes us\r\nbetter able to judge the meaning of the impressions that are moving\r\nthe animal than inarticulate cries, or merely musical sounds. When\r\nJaco met a child for whom he had a great affection, he would promenade\r\non his perch, or turn the wheel, spreading out his tail and ruffling\r\nthe feathers of his head, while his eyes grew red with excitement if\r\nthe child was too slow in bestowing the accustomed caress. Then he\r\nwould stop, bend down his head, and, looking at his friend, say\r\npleasantly, \"Jaco,\" in a tone and with a manner quite in contrast with\r\nthe pronunciation of the same word when he was hungry.\r\n\r\nIt is not the word he speaks that is of interest; he might have been\r\ntaught another, and it would have been the same; but it is the tone.\r\nIn this case, too, the articulation gives an easier clew to the\r\nmeaning the bird seeks to express, having a meaning according to the\r\nmanner of pronouncing it, than any isolated, simply musical sound,\r\nlike the song of the nightingale, canary bird, and warbler. This\r\nbecame evident to me, not from observing animals for a few moments\r\nwithout seeing them again, but from studying them continuously.\r\n\r\nJaco did not like solitude, and was talkative and fond of being\r\ncaressed, like all of his kind. One day, when there was no one in the\r\ncountry house, all having gone out into the garden or the fields, I\r\nheard him saying over what few words he knew, in different\r\ninflections. I went quietly into the room where he was, without being\r\nseen; but he heard my steps, although I walked in very cautiously,\r\nhoping to surprise him. He ceased his chatter, listened, and, after a\r\nsilence, pronounced \"Jaco\" in a low tone, drawing out the end of the\r\nword. He listened again, and repeated the word in the same tone; then,\r\nafter another silence, repeated it with a rise of the voice. I\r\ncontinued observing him, and, as he heard no one, he raised his tone\r\ngradually, repeating the same word, and ended at last with a genuine\r\ncry of distress. The people ran in from without, supposing something\r\nhad happened to him. He then repeated his name in a lower tone, which\r\nseemed to indicate his satisfaction at finding his isolation ended. I\r\nwent in myself, and his prattle unmistakably betrayed his gladness at\r\nbeing no longer alone.\r\n\r\nIs there not in this an act of real intelligence? While alone, the\r\nparrot entertained himself by talking; but when he heard a sound he\r\nhoped at first to see some one come; and when no one answered him, he\r\nraised his voice, as a person would do who calls, and, getting no\r\nreply, cried out louder and louder till he was heard and answered. The\r\nmeaning of the differences of intonation is as evident in this case as\r\nin that of the drunken man. A parrot raised in the South had learned\r\nto swear in the local _patois_. Being fond of coffee, he was sometimes\r\ngiven a spoonful, which he would come awkwardly up to the table to\r\ndrink with his master. One day the master, not thinking of his bird,\r\nhad already added cognac to his coffee, and gave the parrot the\r\naccustomed spoonful. The parrot took a swallow of it, and, in his\r\nsurprise at the novel taste, raised his head and repeated the oath in\r\na tone that excited laughter in all who were present. The cause of his\r\nsurprise being discovered, he was soothed, and then took his usual\r\nration with evident signs of contentment. The mimicry of language in\r\nthis case clearly represented the shade of the new impression he felt.\r\n\r\nJaco is very timid. In the evening, when he is put to roost in a close\r\nand dark room, he is afraid of the shadow of his perch that is cast by\r\nthe light we carry in our hand; he eyes it, and utters a low cry,\r\nwhich stops when the candle is blown out and he cannot see the shadow\r\nany longer. He stands in dread of blows in the bottom of his cage,\r\nbecause, having a wing broken, he cannot fly, and is afraid of\r\nfalling. Feeling his weakness, his language has a different tone from\r\nthe usual one. Large birds flying in the sky above him annoy him\r\ngreatly, and we can all tell by his voice when such a bird is near or\r\nflying over. He inclines his head and chatters in a low tone as long\r\nas the bird is in sight, paying no attention to anything else. Turkeys\r\nand hens announce the approach of a bird of prey in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nWe find in the facts which we have related, as well as in many others\r\nwhich are cited respecting the ways and habits of parrots, proofs of a\r\nremarkable intelligence. These creatures are distinguished by the\r\nunlimited affection which they bestow upon some persons, as well as by\r\ntheir excessive dislikes, which nothing can explain. Jaco conceived an\r\nextraordinary dislike for a maid who, although she took good care of\r\nhim, was in the habit of washing the bottom of his cage under a\r\nfaucet. He afterward discarded another person, whom he had liked so\r\nmuch that she could do what she pleased with him, even to passing her\r\nhand over his back and taking him by the tail, holding him in her\r\nhands, or putting him in her apron--caresses of a kind that parrots do\r\nnot usually permit. Nothing astonished him or offended him. He proved\r\nvery inconstant toward her, and now, while better disposed toward the\r\nother girl, he is furious against this one. A third miss has come to\r\ncapture his affection; and when he has been left asleep, or resting in\r\nhis cage, he has always the same word, but different in the inflection\r\nwheedling, angry, or nearly indifferent, as either of the three\r\npersons comes near him. Jaco's pronunciation is scanned in many\r\nmeters. Only one young student has had the privilege of retaining his\r\naffection unmarred.\r\n\r\nJaco had been left in the country for a whole week in the winter.\r\nAlone and isolated, he was taken care of by a person who was not\r\nconstantly with him. The young student, accompanied by a tutor, came\r\nto pass a few days in the house. At the sight of the youth, Jaco,\r\nsurprised, called out, \"Momon! Momon!\" \"It was affecting,\" they wrote\r\nme, \"to see so great signs of joy.\" I have also myself witnessed\r\nsimilar signs of joy at the coming of the student. Jaco's speech at\r\nsuch times is always in harmony with his feelings. In the pleasant\r\nseason Jaco's cage is put outdoors; and at meal times, knowing very\r\nwell what is going on within, he keeps up a steady course of suppliant\r\nappeals for attention. His appeals cease at once if I go out with\r\nfruit in my hand, and if I go toward him he utters a prattle of joy\r\nthat sounds like musical laughter. These manifestations indicate that\r\nhe is happy at seeing that he has been thought of.\r\n\r\nI close these anecdotes, as I began them, by repeating that animals\r\ncommunicate their impressions, and the feelings that move them, by\r\nvarious modulations of their inarticulate cries, which are\r\nincomprehensible to us unless we have succeeded by attentive\r\nobservation in connecting them with the acts that follow or precede\r\nthem. We have also seen that the articulation of a few words learned\r\nby parrots aids us greatly in learning the meaning of these different\r\ninflections.\r\n\r\nThe extension of these studies would furnish much of interest; but\r\nfurther observations should be made upon the same animals for a\r\nlongtime continuously, relating especially to their peculiar instincts\r\nas manifested by their various cries. We might then, by comparing and\r\nrelating acts and cries, reach the point of comprehending and perhaps\r\nfixing the meaning in many cases where we are now in ignorance. Every\r\none has noticed a few facts, and has interpreted and related them, but\r\nmuch is still wanting for the co-ordination of them in the point of\r\nview of the signification of the language and communication of animals\r\namong themselves. It has not been made in a general sense.\r\n--_Translated for the Popular Science Monthly from the Revue\r\nScientifique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMODIFICATION OF OUR CLIMATE.\r\n\r\nBy JOSEPH WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery now and then some weather sage predicts extremely cold winters,\r\nand another ventures to say that the sun is gradually losing heat and\r\nin time Arctic cold will prevail over the globe. Whatever may have\r\nbeen the changes during the vast cycles of time prior to the advent of\r\nman, or whatever may be the changes in the time to come, one thing is\r\nquite certain; that our climate has been much modified within the past\r\ntwo or three thousand years.\r\n\r\n\"There have been fifteen climatic changes since the beginning of the\r\nglacial age, each change lasting 10,500 years, and each change\r\nreversing the season in the two hemispheres, the pole which had\r\nenjoyed continuous summer being doomed to undergo perpetual winter for\r\n10,500 years, and then passing to its former state for an equal term.\r\nThe physical changes upon the earth's surface during the past 80,000\r\nyears modified the changes of climate even in the Arctic regions, so\r\nthat the intense cold of the former epochs was much modified during\r\nthe latter epochs.\" Reckoning these climatic changes in their order,\r\nwe had entered the epoch of a more genial temperature about fifteen\r\nhundred years ago; and if no disturbing change takes place during the\r\npresent epoch, we may reasonably expect a gradual modification of our\r\nwinters for nine thousand years to come. The changes to intense cold\r\nfrom perpetual summer during the greater part of the glacial period\r\nare supposed to have been caused by the high temperature of the north\r\npole as compared to that of the south pole, owing to the distribution\r\nof land around the two, the south having almost none. Dr. Croll thinks\r\nit was caused by the varying inclination of the earth's axis, which\r\nproduced the relative position of the two poles toward the sun to be\r\nperiodically reversed at distant periods. Dr. James Geikie agrees with\r\nCroll on the reverse of seasons every 10,500 years during certain\r\nperiods of high ellipticity of the earth's orbit.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked, \"How could the fauna and flora propagate\r\nthemselves under such conditions?\" The flora itself at the quaternary\r\nage was of extreme vigor. We know this from the little which is left\r\nus, but more especially from the presence of a large number of\r\nherbivorous animals--stags, horses, elephants, rhinoceros, etc.--which\r\nanimated the plains and valleys of Europe and America at the same\r\ntime. Evidently they could not have lived and propagated themselves\r\nwithout abundant vegetation for nourishment and development.\r\n\r\nThat which has deceived the adherents of the glacial theory, as\r\nunderstood in its absolute sense, is, they have generally placed a too\r\nhigh estimate on its extent and intensity. It needs but a little\r\neffort of the reasoning powers to come to the conclusion that the\r\nearth had cooled to the degree that all animal and vegetable life\r\ncould exist upon it, and that a portion of the earth's surface\r\npermanently covered with snow and ice was absolutely indispensable to\r\nthe existence, perpetuity, and well-being of animal and vegetable\r\nlife. Again, they have attributed to the glaciers the rocks, gravels,\r\nand other material which they have found spread here and there long\r\ndistances from the mountains. The transportation of the so-called\r\nerratic rocks has appeared inexplicable in any other way, and the\r\npiles of rock and gravel have been considered so many _moraines_, that\r\nis, deposits of diverse material transported by the glaciers. They do\r\nnot regard the probability of other agents taking the place of\r\nglaciers, and undervalue the moving power of water. Water in liquid\r\nstate has often produced analogous effects, and it has often been the\r\nerror of the glacialists to confound the one with the other. The\r\nerratic rocks and the moraines are undoubtedly the ordinary\r\nindications of the ancient gravels, but, taken isolatedly, they are\r\nnot sufficient proof. In order to convince they should be accompanied\r\nwith a third indication, which is the presence of striated rocks which\r\nwe find in the neighborhood of our actual glaciers. When all these\r\nsigns are together then there is hardly a possibility of error, but\r\none alone is not sufficient, because it can be the effect of another\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the temperature was really lower at the quaternary age and at\r\nthe epoch generally assigned to man's advent in European countries,\r\nbut the difference was not so great as some say. A lowering of four\r\ndegrees is sufficient to explain the ancient extension of the\r\nglaciers. We can look on this figure as the maximum, for it is proved\r\nto-day that humanity played the main _role_ in the glacial phenomena.\r\nThe beds of rivers and the alluvia are there to tell that all the\r\nwater was not in a solid state at that time, that the glaciers were\r\nmuch more extended than in our days, and that the courses of the\r\nrivers were infinitely more abundant. When this is understood we can\r\nreasonably reduce the extension of the ancient glaciers, the lowering\r\nof the temperature at the quaternary age, and account for the\r\nuninterrupted life of the fauna and flora. However, we must not fall\r\ninto the opposite excess and assert, as some have done, that the\r\nglacial period is comparatively recent, the traces of which are too\r\nplain and fresh in some localities to assign to it an age prior to\r\nman, and that the temperature has rather lowered itself since this\r\nepoch. The ancient extension of the glaciers has been followed by a\r\ncorresponding growth and extension of animal life, thus proving that\r\nthe permanence of glaciers is a wise provision and absolutely\r\nessential to man and the high orders of animals and vegetation. The\r\nancient extension does not prove alone that it was much colder than in\r\nhistoric times, for the animals themselves are proof of this. At that\r\ntime the plains of Europe, and of France in particular, were animated\r\nby herds of reindeer, gluttons, camels, and marmots, which one does\r\nnot find to-day except in the higher latitudes or more considerable\r\nheights. The mammoth and rhinoceros are no exception to this, for\r\nnaturalists know they were organized to live in cold countries.\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit us to pursue this point further, or speculate on\r\nthe probable climatic conditions of the ice age; but we can carry\r\nourselves back a few thousand years and describe the climate of Europe\r\nand neighboring countries of Africa and Asia. Herodotus describes the\r\nclimate of Scythia in terms which would indicate in our day the\r\ncountries of Lapland and Greenland. He shows us the country completely\r\nfrozen during eight months of the year; the Black Sea frozen up so\r\nthat it bore the heaviest loads; the region of the Danube buried under\r\nsnow for eight months, and watered in summer by the abundant rains\r\nwhich gave to the river its violent course. The historian adds that\r\nthe ass cannot live in Scythia on account of the extreme cold which\r\nreigns there. The following century Aristotle makes the same remarks\r\nconcerning Gaul. His contemporary, Theophrastes, tells us that the\r\nolive tree did not succeed in Greece more than five hundred furlongs\r\nfrom the sea. We can assure ourselves that both the ass and the olive\r\nthrive in these countries at the present day.\r\n\r\nThree centuries later, Cæsar speaks frequently and emphatically of the\r\nrigor of winters and early setting in of cold in France, the abundance\r\nof snow and rain, and the number of lakes and marshes which became\r\nevery moment serious obstacles to the army. He says he is careful not\r\nto undertake any expedition except in summer. Cicero, Varro,\r\nPossidonius, and Strabo insist equally on the rigor of the climate of\r\nGaul, which allows neither the culture of the vine nor the olive.\r\nDiodorus of Sicily confirms this information: \"The cold of the winters\r\nin Gaul is such that almost all the rivers freeze up and form natural\r\nbridges, over which numerous armies pass quite safely with teams and\r\nbaggages; in order to hinder the passengers to slip out upon the ice\r\nand to render the marching more secure, they spread straw thereon.\"\r\n\r\nVirgil and Ovid insist on the severity of cold in the regions of the\r\nDanube. The first describes the inhabitants of these miserable\r\ncountries withdrawing themselves into caves dressed with the skins of\r\nwild beasts. Ovid, who had passed several years of his life in that\r\nregion, is more precise in his description. He says the wine has\r\nchanged itself here (Black Sea) into a solid frozen mass; one gives it\r\nto drink by pieces. Fearing of being accused of poetic exaggeration he\r\nappeals to the testimony of two ancient governors of Moesia, who could\r\nestablish the facts like himself. The author who would give such\r\naccounts of the Black Sea in our days would risk his reputation for\r\nveracity.\r\n\r\nItaly, too, experienced its part of the cold in early days. Virgil\r\ntells us of the snows being, heaped up, rivers which carried ice\r\nalong, the sad winter which split the stone and bound up the course of\r\nlarge streams, and all this in the warmest part of Italy, at the base\r\nof the walls of Taranto. Heratius affirms that the Soracte, a\r\nneighboring mountain of Rome, was whitened with thick snow, rivers\r\nfrozen, and the country covered with snow. To-day the snow stays very\r\nlittle upon the Soracte and never in the country around Rome. During\r\nthe four or five centuries which followed, writers speak of the\r\nseverity of climate in Northern Italy, the lagoons on the Adriatic\r\nbeing frozen over. Algiers was much colder then than now. The Danube,\r\nRhine, and other rivers in Europe, the Nile in Africa, the Amazon in\r\nSouth America, the Mississippi and Missouri in North America, had\r\nquite different volumes two thousand years ago than their present\r\nactual ones, and they especially rolled much greater masses of water.\r\n\r\nThere is everything to show a modification of climate in our own days.\r\nIf this goes on in the future as in the past, there will be a marked\r\ndifference in the temperature two or three hundred years from now.\r\nEven a degree in a thousand years would effect a great change in the\r\ncourse of time. The lowering of four degrees established the ancient\r\nextension of glaciers, though it did not interrupt animal or vegetable\r\nlife. Fifty-four of the fifty-seven species of _Mollusca_ have\r\noutlived the glacial age, and all our savage animals--even a certain\r\nnumber which have disappeared--date equally from the quaternary, and\r\nwere contemporary with the great extension of the glaciers.--_Popular\r\nScience News_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ERUPTION OF KRAKATOA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the year 1883 physical geographers, in speaking of the most\r\ndisastrous volcanic eruption on record, referred first, in point of\r\ntime, to the celebrated eruption of Vesuvius, in A.D. 79, when the\r\ncities of Herculaneum, Pompeii and several smaller towns on the slope\r\nof the mountain were destroyed by lava or buried under a mass of\r\npumice stones and ashes; second to that of Hecla and Skaptar Jokull,\r\ncontiguous mountains in Iceland, in 1783, when two enormous lava\r\nstreams, one 15 miles wide and over 100 ft. deep and the other\r\nscarcely inferior, flowed, the first, 50 miles and the other 40, till\r\nthey reached the sea, pouring a flood of white hot lava into the\r\nocean, destroying everything in their paths and killing in the waters\r\nof the ocean the fish, the mainstay of the inhabitants, who were\r\nreduced by the disaster, directly or indirectly, to less than\r\nfive-sixths of their former strength; and third to that of Galungung,\r\nin 1822, which devastated such an immense area in Java; but all the\r\neruptions known besides were as mere child's play to the terrible one\r\nof Krakatoa in 1883.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will examine the map of the East Indies he will find\r\nrepresented in the straits of Sunda, which lie between Sumatra and\r\nJava, the little island of Krakatoa. In maps made before 1883 he will\r\nhunt in vain for the name, for like Bull Run before 1861, it was then\r\nunknown to fame, though navigators who passed through the straits knew\r\nit as a beautiful tropical isle, with an extinct volcanic cone in the\r\ncenter. In the beginning of 1883, however, the little well behaved\r\nisland showed symptoms of wrath that boded no good to the larger\r\nislands in the vicinity. Noted for the fine fruits with which it\r\nabounded, it was a famous picnic ground for towns and cities even 100\r\nmiles away, and when the subterranean rumblings and mutterings of\r\nwrath became conspicuous the people of the capital of Java, Batavia,\r\nput a steamboat into requisition and visited the island in large\r\nnumbers. For a time the island was constantly in a slight tremor, and\r\nthe subterranean roar was like the continued but distant mutterings of\r\nthunder, but the crisis was reached August 23, at 10 o'clock A.M. It\r\nwas a beautiful Sunday morning and the waters of the straits of Sunda\r\nwere like that sea of glass, as clear as crystal, of which John in his\r\napocalyptic vision speaks. The beauty that morning was enhanced by the\r\nextraordinary transparency of the tropical air, for distant mountain\r\nranges seemed so near that it seemed possible to strike them with a\r\nstone cast from the hand. Only the mysterious rumblings and mutterings\r\nof the pent up forces beneath the island disturbed the breathless calm\r\nand silence that lay on nature--the calm before the terrible\r\nstorm--the mightiest, the most awful on record! It burst forth! Sudden\r\nnight snatched away day from the eyes of the terrified beholders on\r\nthe mainland, but the vivid play of lightnings around the ascending\r\ncolumn of dust penetrated even the deep obscurity to a distance of 80\r\nmiles. This awful darkness stretched within a circle whose diameter\r\nwas 400 miles, while more or less darkness reigned within a circle\r\nwith a diameter three times as great. Within this latter area dust\r\nfell like snow from the sky, breaking off limbs of trees by its weight\r\nmiles distant, while in Batavia, 100 miles away from the scene of the\r\ndisaster, it fell to the depth of several inches. The explosions were\r\nso loud as to be distinctly heard in Hindostan, 1,800 miles away, and\r\nat Batavia the sound was like the constant roar of cannon in a field\r\nof battle. Finally the whole island was blown to pieces, and now came\r\nthe most awful contest of nature--a battle of death between Neptune\r\nand Vulcan; the sea poured down into the chasm millions of tons, only\r\nto be at first converted into vapor by the millions of tons of\r\nseething white hot lava beneath. Over the shores 30 miles away, waves\r\nover 100 ft. high rolled with such a fury that everything, even to a\r\npart of the bedrock, was swept away. Blocks of stone, of 50 tons\r\nweight were carried two miles inland. On the Sumatra side of the\r\nstraits a large vessel was carried three miles inland. The wave, of\r\ncourse growing less in intensity, traveled across the whole Indian\r\nOcean, 5,000 miles, to the Cape of Good Hope and around it into the\r\nAtlantic. The waves in the atmosphere traveled around the globe three\r\ntimes at the rate of 700 miles per hour. The dust from the volcano was\r\ncarried up into the atmosphere fully twenty miles and the finest of it\r\nwas distributed through the whole body of air. The reader doubtless\r\nremembers the beautiful reddish or purple glow at sunrise and sunset\r\nfor fully six months after August, 1883--that glow was caused by\r\nvolcanic dust in the atmosphere interfering with the passage of the\r\nsun's rays of the upper part of the solar spectrum, more manifest at\r\nsun rising and setting than at other times during the day, because at\r\nthese periods the sun's rays have to travel obliquely through the\r\natmosphere, and consequently penetrating a very deep layer, were\r\ndeprived of all their colors except the red.\r\n\r\nThe loss of life was appalling. The last sight on earth to 35,000\r\npeople was that of the awful eruption. Engulfed in the ocean or\r\ncovered with heaps of ashes, a few hours after the eruption commenced\r\nthe awful work was done, and that vast multitude had vanished from off\r\nthe face of the earth. The fact that in the neighborhood of the\r\nmountain there was a sparse population accounts for there not being\r\neven a far greater loss of life.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the awfulness of volcanic and earthquake phenomena,\r\nthere is some silver lining to the dark clouds. They prove that the\r\nearth is yet a _living_ planet. Centuries must pass away before it\r\nwill become like the moon--a dead planet--without water, air or life.\r\nOur satellite is a prophecy indeed of what the earth must eventually\r\nbecome when all its life forces, its internal energies, are dissipated\r\ninto space.--_Granville F. Foster, Min. Sci. Press_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPENTAPTERYGIUM SERPENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is one of five species of Himalayan plants which, until recently,\r\nwere included in the genus vaccinium. The new name for them is ugly\r\nenough to make one wish that they were vacciniums still.\r\nPentapterygium serpens is the most beautiful of the lot, and, so far\r\nas I know, this and P. rugosum are the only species in cultivation in\r\nEngland. The former was collected in the Himalayas about ten years ago\r\nby Captain Elwes, who forwarded it to Kew, where it grows and flowers\r\nfreely under the same treatment as suits Cape heaths. Sir Joseph\r\nHooker says it is abundant on the Sikkim mountains at from 3,000 to\r\n8,000 feet elevation, and that it usually grows on the stout limbs of\r\nlofty trees. In this it resembles many of the rhododendrons of that\r\nregion, and it has been suggested that they are epiphytic from force\r\nof circumstances, not from choice. On the ground they would have no\r\nchance against the other vegetation, which would strangle or starve\r\nthem out. Remove them from this struggle for existence, and they at\r\nonce show their preference for rich soil and plenty of it. All the\r\npentapterygiums have the lower part of the stem often swelling out\r\ninto a prostrate trunk, as thick as a man's leg sometimes, and sending\r\nout stout branching roots which cling tightly round the limbs of the\r\ntree upon which it grows. These swollen stems are quite succulent, and\r\nthey serve as reservoirs of moisture and nourishment. In the wet\r\nseason they push out new shoots, from which grow rapidly wands three\r\nor four feet long, clothed with box-like leaves, and afterward with\r\nnumerous pendulous flowers. These are elegant in shape and richly\r\ncolored. They are urn-shaped, with five ribs running the whole length\r\nof the corolla, and their color is bright crimson with deeper colored\r\nV-shaped veins, as shown in the illustration of the flowers of almost\r\nnatural size. They remain fresh upon the plant for several weeks. The\r\nbeautiful appearance of a well grown specimen when in flower may be\r\nseen from the accompanying sketch of the specimen at Kew, which was at\r\nits best in July, and remained in bloom until the middle of September.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENTAPTERYGIUM SERPENS (FLOWERS NEARLY NATURAL SIZE)]\r\n\r\nP. rugosum is also grown as a greenhouse plant at Kew, where it has\r\nbeen in cultivation about twenty years. It has larger leaves and a\r\nmore bushy habit than P. serpens, while the flowers are produced in\r\nfascicles on the old wood. They are as large as those here figured,\r\nbut differ in color, being whitish, with brown-red V-shaped marks.\r\nBoth species may be propagated from cuttings. The plants thrive in\r\nsandy peat, and they like plenty of moisture at all times.--_W.\r\nWatson, in The Gardeners' Magazine_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PENTAPTERYGIUM SERPENS (FLOWERS DEEP CRIMSON)]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERFORATION OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of the relations and adaptations which exist between\r\nflowers and insects does not appear to excite as much popular\r\nattention as many other branches of natural science which are no more\r\ninteresting. Sprengel, Darwin, and Hermann Muller have been the chief\r\nauthors in giving us our present knowledge and interest in the study;\r\nSir John Lubbock has helped to popularize it, and Prof. W. Trelease\r\nand others have carried on the work in this country.\r\n\r\nThe perforation as well as the fertilization of flowers has received\r\nattention, but there is a wide field for further study for those who\r\nhave leisure to pursue it, as it requires much time and patience, as\r\nwell as closeness and accuracy of observation.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying figures, from drawings by Mr. C.E. Faxon, show a few\r\ncharacteristic perforations and mutilations, and also represent two of\r\nthe principal kinds of insects which make them.\r\n\r\nAny one interested in the subject will find an excellent brief review\r\nof the work already done, a fair bibliography, and a list of\r\nperforated flowers in Professor L.H. Pammel's paper on the\r\n\"Perforation of Flowers,\" in the _Transactions of the St. Louis\r\nAcademy of Science_, vol. v., pp. 246-277.\r\n\r\nThe general beauty of flowers is usually not greatly marred by the\r\nperforations except in a few cases, as when the spurs of columbines\r\nand corollas of trumpet creepers are much torn, which frequently\r\nhappens.\r\n\r\nThe great object of the perforations by insects is the obtaining of\r\nthe concealed nectar in an easy way. Very naturally, flowers which\r\ndepend on insect agency for fertilization rarely produce seed when\r\npunctured if they are not also entered in the normal way. Perforating\r\nis only practiced by a small number of species of insects, and many\r\nbut not all of the perforators do so because their tongues are too\r\nshort to reach the nectar by entering the flower. Some obtain nectar\r\nfrom the same kind of flower both in the normal way and by\r\nperforating.\r\n\r\nThe chief perforators of flowers, in this part of the continent at\r\nleast, appear to be some kinds of humble bees (Bombus) and carpenter\r\nbees (Xylocopa). These insects have developed an unerring instinct as\r\nto the proper point to perforate the corollas from the outside, in\r\norder to readily get at the nectar. The holes made by the humble bees\r\nand by the carpenter bees are usually quite different and easily\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe humble bees have short, stout, blunt jaws, ill adapted for\r\ncutting, and the perforations made by them are apparently always\r\nirregular in shape, and have jagged edges. It has been stated that the\r\nhumble bees often bore through the tubes of their corollas with their\r\nmaxillæ, but in all cases observed by me the mandibles were first\r\nbrought into use in effecting an opening. The noise caused by the\r\ntearing is often audible for a distance of several feet.\r\n\r\nThe true jaws of the carpenter bees are not any more prominent or\r\nbetter adapted for making clean-cut perforations than those of the\r\nhumble bees; but behind the jaws there is a pair of long,\r\nsharp-pointed, knife-like, jointed organs (maxillæ) which seem to be\r\nexclusively used on all ordinary occasions in making perforations. The\r\ninner edges of these maxillæ are nearly straight, and when brought\r\ntogether they form a sharp-pointed, wedge-shaped, plow-like instrument\r\nwhich makes a clean, narrow, longitudinal slit when it is inserted in\r\nthe flower and shoved forward. The slits made by it are often not\r\nreadily seen, because the elasticity of the tissues of some flowers\r\ncauses them to partially close again. When not in use the instrument\r\ncan be folded back, so that it is not conspicuous. The ordinary\r\nobserver usually sees no difference between the humble bees and the\r\ncarpenter bees, but they may be readily distinguished by a little\r\nclose observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PERFORATION OF FLOWERS.\r\n\r\n1.

Corydalis\r\nbulbosa.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt, in some of the recorded cases of perforations, carpenter\r\nbees have been mistaken for humble bees. The heads of all our Northern\r\nhumble bees are rather narrow, retreating from the antennæ toward the\r\nsides, and with a more or less dense tuft of hair between the antennæ.\r\nThe abdomen, as well as the thorax, is always quite densely covered\r\nwith hair, which may be black or yellowish or in bands of either\r\ncolor. With possibly one or two exceptions, the only species I have\r\nseen doing the puncturing is Bombus affinis, Cresson.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter bees (Xylocopa Virginica) of this region have the head\r\nvery broad and square in front, and with no noticeable hair between\r\nthe antennæ. The heads of the male and female differ strikingly. In\r\nthe male the eyes are lighter colored and are hardly half as far apart\r\nas in the female, and the lower part of the face is yellowish white.\r\nThe female has eyes smaller, darker, and very far apart, and the whole\r\nface is perfectly black. The abdomen is broad, of a shining blue-black\r\ncolor, very sparsely covered with black hairs, except on the first\r\nlarge segment nearest the thorax. On this segment they are more dense\r\nand of the same tawny color as those on the thorax. But it is\r\nparticularly from the character of the head that the amateur observer\r\nof the perforators may soon learn to distinguish between a Xylocopa\r\nand a Bombus as they work among the flowers. It is also interesting to\r\nknow that the Xylocopas are not so inclined to sting as the humble\r\nbees, and the males, of course, being without stinging organs, may be\r\nhandled with impunity.\r\n\r\nAmong other insects, honey bees have been said to perforate flowers,\r\nbut authentic instances are rare of their doing much damage, or even\r\nmaking holes. I have only recorded a single instance, and in this a\r\nhoney bee was seen to perforate the fragile spurs of Impatiens. When\r\nsearching for nectar they quite commonly use the perforations of other\r\ninsects. Wasps and other allied insects also perforate for nectar. My\r\nonly observations being a Vespa puncturing Cassandra calyculata, an\r\nAndrena (?) perforating the spurs of Aguilegia, and Adynerus\r\nforaminatus biting holes close to the base on the upper side of\r\nrhododendron flowers. The holes made by some of the wasp-like insects\r\nare often more or less circular and with clean-cut edges. The ravages\r\ncommitted by larvæ, beetles and other insects in devouring flowers, or\r\nparts of them, do not properly come under the head of perforations.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the cause of the handsome corollas of the trumpet\r\ncreeper (Tecoma radicans) being so often split and torn has been\r\naccounted for in various ways in published notes on the subject.\r\nHumming birds and ants have been blamed, the humming birds being such\r\nconstant visitors of these flowers that it really seemed as though\r\nthey must be the authors of the mischief. I have often watched them\r\nwhen they appeared as though they were pecking at the blossoms, but\r\ncareful examinations, both before and after their visits, always\r\nfailed to show any trace of injury. Finally, on July 26, 1890, I was\r\nrewarded by seeing a number of Baltimore orioles vigorously pecking at\r\nand tearing open a lot of fresh blossoms, and this observation was\r\nafterward repeated. That the oriole should do this was not surprising,\r\nconsidering its known habits in relation to some other flowers. J.G.\r\nJACK.\r\n\r\n[Mr. Jack adds a list of sixteen plants whose flowers he has seen\r\npunctured by the carpenter bee and seventeen others whose flowers were\r\npunctured by the humble bee. He names more than thirty other flowers\r\nwhich he has found perforated without having seen or identified the\r\nauthors of the mischief.--ED.]--_Garden and Forest_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY IN HORTICULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of electricity upon vegetation has been the subject of\r\nnumerous investigations. Some have been made to ascertain the effects\r\nof the electric current through the soil; others to ascertain the\r\neffect of the electric light upon growth through the air. Among the\r\nlatter are those of Prof. L.H. Bailey of the Cornell University\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station. In Bulletin No. 30 of the\r\nHorticultural Department is given an account of experiments with the\r\nelectric light upon the growth of certain vegetables, like endive,\r\nspinach, and radish; and upon certain flowers like the heliotrope,\r\npetunia, verbena primula, etc. The results are interesting and\r\nsomewhat variable. The forcing house where the experiments were\r\ncarried on was 20 × 60 ft., and was divided into two portions by a\r\npartition. In one of these the plants received light from the sun by\r\nday and were in darkness at night. In the other they received the\r\nsunlight and in addition had the benefit of an arc light the whole or\r\na part of the night. The experiment lasted from January until April\r\nduring two years, six weeks of the time the first year with a naked\r\nlight and the balance of the time with the light protected by an\r\nordinary white globe. It is not the purpose here to enter into any\r\ngreat details, but to give the general conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the naked light running all night was to hasten\r\nmaturity, the nearer the plants being to the light the greater being\r\nthe acceleration. The lettuce, spinach, etc., \"ran to seed\" in the\r\n\"light\" house long before similar plants in the dark. An examination\r\nof the spinach leaves with the microscope showed the same amount of\r\nstarch in each, but in the electric light plants the grains were\r\nlarger, had more distinct markings and gave a deeper color with\r\niodine.\r\n\r\nWith lettuce it was found that the nearer the plants were to the light\r\nthe worse the effect; and conversely those furthest away were the best\r\ndeveloped. Cress and endive gave the same results. In the case of the\r\nlatter, some of the plants were shaded from the light by an iron post,\r\nand these grew better and were larger than those exposed to its direct\r\nrays. The average weight of eight plants in full light was 49.6\r\ngrains, as opposed to an average of six plants in the shade of 93.8\r\ngrains. Radishes were strongly attracted to the light and moved toward\r\nit during the night. During the day they straightened up, but moved\r\nagain toward the light at night. The plants nearest the lamp made a\r\npoor growth and were nearly dead at the end of six weeks. Averaging\r\nthe weight of plant, of top and of tuber, it was found that those\r\ngrown in the dark were heavier in every instance than those grown in\r\nthe light; and the percentage of marketable tubers from the\r\nlight-grown plants was twenty-seven, as opposed to seventy-eight in\r\nthe dark. Chemical analyses showed the plants in the light to be more\r\nmature than those in the dark, although they were much smaller. Dwarf\r\npeas showed the same facts, those in full light being smaller than\r\nthose in the dark. The former bloomed a week earlier than the latter,\r\nbut the production of seed was less, being only about four-sevenths as\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nFurther experiments were made by excluding the sun during the day and\r\nexposing the plants to the diffused electric light only. In all cases,\r\nwith radishes, lettuce, peas, corn, and potatoes, the plants died in\r\nabout four weeks. Only a little starch and no chlorophyl was found in\r\nthe plants deprived of sunlight and only receiving the electric light.\r\nThus the experiments with a naked light showed conclusively that\r\n\"within range of an ordinary forcing house the naked arc light running\r\ncontinuously through the night is injurious to some plants.\" In no\r\ncase did it prove profitable.\r\n\r\nExperiments with the light inclosed in a white globe and running all\r\nnight were different in their results. The effect was much less\r\nmarked. Lettuce was decidedly better in the light house; radishes were\r\nthrifty but did not produce as much as in the dark house. A third\r\nseries of experiments with the naked light running a part of the night\r\nonly were also made. Radishes, peas, lettuce, and many flowers were\r\nexperimented upon. The lettuce was greatly benefited by the light.\r\n\"Three weeks after transplanting (Feb. 5),\" we are told, \"both\r\nvarieties in the lighthouse were fully 50 per cent. in advance of\r\nthose in the dark house in size, and the color and other characters of\r\nthe plants were fully as good. The plants had received at this time\r\n70½ hours of electric light. Just a month later the first heads were\r\nsold from the light house, but it was six weeks later when the first\r\nheads were sold from the dark house. In other words, the electric\r\nlight plants were two weeks ahead of the others. This gain had been\r\npurchased by 161¾ hours of electric light, worth at current prices of\r\nstreet lighting about $7.\"\r\n\r\nThis experiment was repeated with the same results. In the second\r\nexperiment the plants receiving eighty-four hours of electric light,\r\ncosting $3.50, were ready for market ten days before the plants in the\r\ndark house. The influence of the light upon color of flowers was\r\nvariable. With tulips the colors of the lighted plants were deeper and\r\nricher than the others, but they faded after four or five days.\r\nVerbenas were injured in every case, being of shorter growth and\r\nlosing their flowers sooner than those in the dark house. \"Scarlet,\r\ndark red, blue and pink flowers within three feet of the light soon\r\nturned to a grayish white.\" Chinese primulas seven feet from the light\r\nwere unaffected, but those four feet away were changed. Lilac colors\r\nwere bleached to pure white when the light struck them fairly. An\r\nelaborate series of tables of the effect of the light is given in the\r\npaper. The author believes it possible that the electric light may be\r\nused some day to pecuniary advantage in floricultural establishments.\r\n\r\nThese experiments naturally open up many questions. Those which will\r\nbe of most importance to the practical man will be such as relate to\r\nthe benefits to be derived from the use of the electric light. That\r\nelectricity has a great effect upon vegetation can no longer be\r\ndenied. What remains now is to ascertain how to use the force with the\r\nmost economy and to the best advantage. If by its use early vegetables\r\nwill be made earlier, bright flowers be made brighter, it will be a\r\nquestion of only a short time before it will come into general use. To\r\nthe student of plant physiology there are also many questions of\r\ninterest, but into these it is not the intention to enter. Prof.\r\nBailey's general conclusions are, in part, as follows: \"There are a\r\nfew points which are clear: the electric light promotes assimilation,\r\nit often hastens growth and maturity, it is capable of producing\r\nnatural flavors and colors in fruits, it often intensifies colors of\r\nflowers and sometimes increases the production of flowers. The\r\nexperiments show that periods of darkness are not necessary to the\r\ngrowth and development of plants. There is every reason, therefore, to\r\nsuppose that the electric light can be profitably used in the growing\r\nof plants. It is only necessary to overcome the difficulties, the\r\nchief of which are the injurious influences upon plants near the\r\nlight, the too rapid hastening to maturity in some species, and in\r\nshort the whole series of practical adjustments of conditions to\r\nindividual circumstances. Thus far, to be sure, we have learned more\r\nof the injurious effects than of the beneficial ones, but this only\r\nmeans that we are acquiring definite facts concerning the whole\r\ninfluence of electric light upon vegetation; and in some cases,\r\nnotably in our lettuce tests, the light has already been found to be a\r\nuseful adjunct to forcing establishments.... It is highly probable\r\nthat there are certain times in the life of the plant when the\r\nelectric light will prove to be particularly helpful. Many experiments\r\nshow that injury follows its use at that critical time when the\r\nplanetlet is losing its support from the seed and is beginning to\r\nshift for itself, and other experiments show that good results follow\r\nfrom its later use.... On the whole, I am inclined toward Siemens'\r\nview that there is a future for electro-horticulture.\"\r\n\r\nJOSEPH P.

WARNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that currents of electricity exist in the atmosphere.\r\nClouds are charged and discharged. There is a constant change of\r\nelectricity from earth to air and from air to earth, the latter being\r\nthe great reservoir for all electricity. Hills, mountain peaks, trees,\r\nhigh chimneys, spires, in fact all points elevated above the earth's\r\nsurface assist greatly in charging and discharging the atmosphere.\r\nAgain, if two iron rods are driven into the earth and connected by a\r\ncopper wire with an electrometer in the circuit, the instrument is\r\nalmost immediately affected, showing that currents of electricity are\r\nrunning through the ground. Now, what is the function of these\r\natmospheric and ground electric currents? Many scientists are agreed\r\nthat certain forms of precipitation are due to electrical action; but\r\nmy observations have led me to believe conclusively that electricity\r\nis a potent factor in the economy of nature, and has more to do with\r\nthe growth and development of plants than has hitherto been known.\r\nDavy succeeded in the decomposition of the alkalies, potash and soda,\r\nby means of electric currents. In our laboratories, water and ternary\r\ncompounds are rapidly decomposed by the battery, and we may reasonably\r\nsuppose that that which is effected in our laboratories by artificial\r\nmeans takes place in the great laboratory of nature on a grander and\r\nmore extended scale.\r\n\r\nPlant food is carried throughout the plant by means of the flow of\r\nsap; these currents circulate through all the rootlets and center, as\r\nit were, in the stalk, carrying their tiny burdens of various elements\r\nand depositing them in their proper places. That this phenomenon of\r\ncirculation is due to electricity cannot be doubted. Most plants grow\r\nmore rapidly during the night than in the day. May not the following\r\nbe a reason for this?\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned how electric currents pass from air to earth\r\nand _vice versa_; at night the plant is generally covered with dew and\r\nthe plant itself becomes a good conductor, and, consequently, currents\r\nof electricity pass to each through this medium, and during the\r\npassage convert soil elements into plant food and stimulate the upward\r\ncurrents to gather up the dissolved elements and carry them to their\r\nproper places.\r\n\r\nFrom the time electricity became a science, much research has been\r\nmade to determine its effect, if any, upon plant growth. The earlier\r\ninvestigations gave in many cases contradictory results. Whether this\r\nwas due to a lack of knowledge of the science on the part of the one\r\nperforming the experiments, or some defect in the technical\r\napplications, we are not prepared to say; but this we do know, that\r\nsuch men as Jolabert, Nollet, Mainbray and other eminent physicists\r\naffirmed that electricity favored the germination of seeds and\r\naccelerated the growth of plants; while, on the other hand,\r\nIngenhouse, Sylvestre and other savants denied the existence of this\r\nelectric influence. The heated controversies and animated discussions\r\nattending the opposing theories stimulated more careful and thorough\r\ninvestigations, which establish beyond a doubt that electricity has a\r\nbeneficial effect on vegetation. Sir Humphry Davy, Humboldt, Wollaston\r\nand Becquerel occupied themselves with the theoretical side of the\r\nquestion; but it was not till after 1845 that practical electroculture\r\nwas undertaken. Williamson suggested the use of gigantic electrostatic\r\nmachines, but the attempts were fruitless. The methods most generally\r\nadopted in experiments consisted of two metallic plates--one of copper\r\nand one of zinc--placed in the soil and connected by a wire. Sheppard\r\nemployed the method in England in 1846 and Forster used the same in\r\nScotland. In the year 1847 Hubeck in Germany surrounded a field with a\r\nnetwork of wires. Sheppard's experiments showed that electricity\r\nincreased the return from root crops, while grass perished near the\r\nelectrodes, and plants developed without the use of electricity were\r\ninferior to those grown under its influence. Hubeck came to the\r\nconclusion that seeds germinated more rapidly and buckwheat gave\r\nlarger returns; in all other cases the electric current produced no\r\nresult. Professor Fife in England and Otto von Ende in Germany carried\r\non experiments at the same time, but with negative results, and these\r\nscientists advised the complete abandonment of applying electricity to\r\nagriculture. After some years had elapsed Fichtner began a series of\r\nexperiments in the same direction. He employed a battery, the two\r\nwires of which were placed in the soil parallel to each other. Between\r\nthe wires were planted peas, grass and barley, and in every case the\r\ncrop showed an increase of from thirteen to twenty-seven per cent.\r\nwhen compared with ordinary methods of cultivation.\r\n\r\nFischer, of Waldheim, believing atmospheric electricity to aid much in\r\nthe growth and development of plants, made the following tests:\r\n\r\nHe placed metallic supports to the number of about sixty around each\r\nhectare (2.47 acres) of loam; these supports were provided at their\r\nsummits with electrical accumulators in the form of crowns surmounted\r\nwith teeth. These collectors were united by metallic connection. The\r\nresult of this culture applied to cereals was to increase the crop by\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nThe following experiment was also tried: Metallic plates sixty-five\r\ncentimeters by forty centimeters were placed in the soil. These plates\r\nwere alternately of zinc and copper and placed about thirty meters\r\napart, connected two and two, by a wire. The result was to increase\r\nfrom twofold to fourfold the production of certain garden plants. Mr.\r\nFischer says that it is evidently proved that electricity aids in the\r\nmore complete breaking up of the soil constituents. Finally he says\r\nthat plants thus treated mature more quickly, are almost always\r\nperfectly healthy, and are not affected with fungoid growth.\r\n\r\nLater, N. Specnew, inspired by the results arrived at by his\r\npredecessors, was led to investigate the influence of electricity on\r\nplants in every stage of their development; the results of his\r\nexperiments were most satisfactory and of practical interest. He began\r\nby submitting different seeds to the action of an electric current,\r\nand found that their development was rendered more rapid and complete.\r\nHe experimented with the seeds of haricot beans, sunflowers, winter\r\nand spring rye. Two lots, of twelve groups of one hundred and twenty\r\nseeds each, were plunged into water until they swelled, and while wet\r\nthe seeds were introduced into long glass cylinders, open at both\r\nends. Copper disks were pressed against the seeds, the disks were\r\nconnected with the poles of an induction coil, the current was kept on\r\nfor one or two minutes and immediately afterward the seeds were sown.\r\nThe temperature was kept from 45° to 50° Fahrenheit, and the\r\nexperiments repeated four times. The following table shows the\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n                                   Peas.  Beans.  Barley.  Sunflowers.\r\n                                   Days.   Days.    Days.      Days.\r\nElectrified seeds developed in      2.5      3        2          8.5\r\nNon-electrified seeds developed in  4        6        5         15\r\n\r\nIt was also observed that the plants coming from electrified seeds\r\nwere better developed, their leaves were much larger and their color\r\nbrighter than in those plants growing from non-electrified seeds. The\r\ncurrent did not affect the yield.\r\n\r\nAt the Botanical Gardens at Kew, the following experiment was tried:\r\n\r\nLarge plates of zinc and copper (0.445 meter and 0.712 meter) were\r\nplaced in the soil and connected by wires, so arranged that the\r\ncurrent passed through the ground; the arrangement was really a\r\nbattery of (zinc | earth | copper). This method was applied to pot\r\nherbs and flowering plants and also to the growing of garden produce;\r\nin the latter case the result was a large crop and the vegetables\r\ngrown were of enormous size.\r\n\r\nExtensive experiments in electroculture were also made at Pskov,\r\nRussia. Plots of earth were sown to rye, corn, oats, barley, peas,\r\nclover and flax; around these respective plots were placed insulating\r\nrods, on the top of which were crown-shaped collectors--the latter\r\nconnected by means of wires. Atmospheric electricity was thus\r\ncollected above the seeds, and the latter matured in a highly\r\nelectrified atmosphere; the plots were submitted to identical\r\nconditions and the experiments were carried on for five years. The\r\nresults showed a considerable increase in the yield of seed and straw,\r\nthe ripening was more rapid and the barley ripened nearly two weeks\r\nearlier with electroculture. Potatoes grown by the latter method were\r\nseldom diseased, only to 5 per cent., against 10 to 40 per cent. by\r\nordinary culture.\r\n\r\nGrandeau, at the School of Forestry at Nancy, found by experiment that\r\nthe electrical tension always existing between the upper air and soil\r\nstimulated growth. He found plants protected from the influence were\r\nless vigorous than those subject to it.\r\n\r\nMacagno, also believing that the passage of electricity from air\r\nthrough the vine to earth would stimulate growth, selected a certain\r\nnumber of vines, all of the same variety and all in the same condition\r\nof health and development. Sixteen vines were submitted to experiment\r\nand sixteen were left to natural influences. In the ends of the vines\r\nunder treatment, pointed platinum wires were inserted, to which were\r\nattached copper wires, leading to the tops of tall poles near the\r\nvines; at the base of these same vines other platinum wires were\r\ninserted and connected by copper wires with the soil. At the close of\r\nthe experiment, which began April 15, and lasted till September 16,\r\nthe wood, leaves and fruit of both sets of vines were submitted to\r\ncareful analysis with the following results:\r\n\r\n                        Without conductor.  With conductor.\r\n\r\n  Moisture per cent.          78.21            79.84\r\n  Sugar.                      16.86            18.41\r\n  Tartaric acid.               0.880            0.791\r\n  Bitartrate of potash.        0.180            0.186\r\n\r\nThus we see that the percentage of moisture and sugar is greater and\r\nthe undesirable acid lower in those vines subject to electrical\r\ninfluences than in those left to natural conditions. There are also\r\nexperiments which prove the beneficial effects of electricity on vines\r\nattacked by phylloxera.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments were made at this station: Several plots\r\nwere prepared in the greenhouse, all of which had the same kind of\r\nsoil and were subjected to like influences and conditions. Frames in\r\nthe form of a parallelogram, about three feet by two feet, were put\r\ntogether; across the narrow way were run copper wires in series of\r\nfrom four to nine strands, each series separated by a space about four\r\ninches wide, and the strands by a space of one-half inch. These frames\r\nwere buried in the soil of the plot at a little depth, so that the\r\nroots of the garden plants set would come in contact with the wires,\r\nthe supposition being that the currents of electricity passing along\r\nthe wires would decompose into its constituents the plant food in the\r\nvicinity of the roots and more readily prepare it for the plants. Two\r\nelectric gardens were thus prepared and each furnished with two common\r\nbattery cells, so arranged as to allow continuous currents to pass\r\nthrough each series of wires. Near each electric garden was a plot\r\nprepared in the same manner, save the electrical apparatus. We will\r\ncall the two gardens A and B.\r\n\r\nThe place chosen for the experiments was in a part of the greenhouse\r\nwhich is given up largely to the raising of lettuce, and the gardens\r\nwere located where much trouble from mildew had been experienced. The\r\nreason for this choice of location was to notice, if any, the effect\r\nof electricity upon mildew, this disease being, as it is well known, a\r\nsource of much trouble to those who desire to grow early lettuce. The\r\nsoil was carefully prepared, the material taken from a pile of loam\r\ncommonly used in the plant house.\r\n\r\nGarden A was located where mildew had been the most detrimental; the\r\nexperiments began the first of January and closed the first of April.\r\nFor the garden, fifteen lettuce plants of the head variety were\r\nselected, all of the same size and of the same degree of vitality, as\r\nnearly as could be determined; the plants were set directly over the\r\nwires, so that the roots were in contact with the latter; the plants\r\nwere well watered and cared for as in ordinary culture, and the fluid\r\nin the battery cells was renewed from time to time, that the current\r\nof electricity might not become too feeble. At the close of the\r\nexperiments the following results were noted:\r\n\r\nFive plants died from mildew, the others were well developed and the\r\nheads large. The largest heads were over the greatest number of wires\r\nand nearest the electrodes. It was further noticed that the healthiest\r\nand largest plants, as soon as the current became feeble or ceased\r\naltogether, began to be affected with mildew. On examining the roots\r\nof the plants it was found that they had grown about the wires as if\r\nthere they found the greatest amount of nourishment; the roots were\r\nhealthy and in no way appeared to have been injured by the current,\r\nbut, rather, much benefited by the electrical influences.\r\n\r\nBeside garden A was prepared another plot of the same dimensions,\r\nhaving the same kind of soil and treated in like manner as the first,\r\nbut the electrical apparatus and wires were wanting. At the close of\r\nthe experiments only three plants had partially developed, and two of\r\nthese were nearly destroyed by mildew--one only was free from the\r\ndisease. The results, therefore, show that the healthiest and largest\r\nplants grew in the electric plot.\r\n\r\nIn the second experiment, which we called B, twenty plants of the same\r\nvariety of lettuce and of equal size were taken. The treatment given\r\nwas the same as the plants in plot A received. Five plants only\r\nremained unaffected with mildew; seven died from the disease when they\r\nwere half grown; the rest were quite well developed, but at the last\r\npart of the experiment began to be affected. Several heads were large,\r\nthe largest being over the greatest number of wires and nearest the\r\nelectrodes. Examination of the roots disclosed the same phenomena as\r\nin A.\r\n\r\nNear plot B were also set twenty other plants, subjected to like\r\nconditions as the first, but without electricity; all but one died\r\nfrom mildew before they were half grown, the solitary plant that\r\nsurvived being only partly developed at the close of the experiment,\r\nand even this was badly affected with the disease.\r\n\r\nEverything considered, the results were in favor of electricity. Those\r\nplants subjected to the greatest electrical influence were hardier,\r\nhealthier, larger, had a better color, and were much less affected by\r\nmildew than the others. Experiments were made with various grasses,\r\nbut no marked results were obtained.\r\n\r\nThe question would naturally arise whether there may not be a limit\r\nreached where electricity would completely overcome the attack of\r\nmildew and stimulate the plant to a healthy and vigorous condition\r\nthroughout its entire growth. From the fact that the hardiest,\r\nhealthiest, and largest heads of lettuce grew over the greatest number\r\nof currents and nearest the electrodes, it would seem that electricity\r\nis one of the agents employed by nature to aid in supplying the plant\r\nwith nourishment and to stimulate its growth. To what extent plants\r\nmay be submitted to electrical influence, or what strength of current\r\nis best suited to them and what currents prove detrimental to their\r\ndevelopment, have not been determined as yet, but it is desirable to\r\ncontinue this research until some definite information shall be gained\r\non these points. Probably different varieties of plants differ greatly\r\nin their capacity for enduring the action of electric currents without\r\ninjury--experiment alone must determine this.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that the slow discharge of static electricity\r\nfacilitates the assimilation of nitrogen by plants. Faraday showed\r\nthat plants grown in metallic cages, around which circulated electric\r\ncurrents, contained 50 per cent. less organic matter than plants grown\r\nin the open air. It would seem from the researches of the latter\r\nphysicist that those plants requiring a large percentage of nitrogen\r\nfor their development would be remarkably benefited if grown under\r\nelectric influence.--_Massachusetts Agricultural College, Bulletin No\r\n16._\r\n\r\n[A very interesting article on the Influence of Electricity upon\r\nPlants, illustrated, is given in SUPPLEMENT 806. It presents the\r\nresults of the studies of Prof. Lemstrom, of Helsingfors.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF RATTLESNAKE BITE BY PERMANGANATE OF POTASSIUM,\r\nBASED ON NINE SUCCESSFUL CASES.\r\n\r\nBy AMOS W. BARBER, M.D.,[1] Cheyenne.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Governor of Wyoming.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPoisoned wounds, inflicted by the fangs of the rattlesnake, are\r\nhappily more rare each year, since, as the country is becoming more\r\npopulated, the crotalus is rapidly being exterminated. Yet,\r\nconsidering the recklessness which characterizes the cow boy in his\r\ntreatment of this reptile, it is astonishing that this class of injury\r\nis not more common. Thus it is the invariable custom among the\r\ncattlemen to dismount and destroy these snakes whenever they are seen.\r\nThis is readily accomplished, since a slight blow will break the back.\r\nThis blow is, however, generally delivered by means of the quirt, a\r\nwhip not over two and a half feet long, and hence a weapon which\r\nbrings the one who wields it in unpleasant proximity to the fangs of\r\nthe reptile. A still more dangerous practice, and one which I have\r\nfrequently seen, is a method of playing with the rattlesnake for the\r\ndelectation of the cow boy at the expense of a \"tenderfoot.\" It is\r\nwell known that unless a snake is coiled, or held by the tail or body,\r\nor placed at length in a hole or crevice so narrow that by rendering\r\nits length sinuous a certain amount of support is given, it cannot\r\nstrike. On this theory a mounted cow boy first puts a rattler to\r\nflight, then pushes his pony in pursuit, stoops from the saddle,\r\nseizes it by the tail, gives a quick upward jerk, and, swinging it so\r\nrapidly around his head that it is impossible for it to strike, sets\r\noff in pursuit of whoever has exhibited most terror at the sight of\r\nthe reptile. When within fair distance he hurls the snake at the\r\nunfortunate victim, in the full assurance that even should it strike\r\nhim it cannot bury its fangs in his flesh, since it is impossible for\r\nit to coil till it reaches the ground. This is a jest of which I have\r\nfrequently been the victim, nor have I yet learned to appreciate it\r\nwith unalloyed mirth.\r\n\r\nThe belief that rattlesnakes always give warning before striking is\r\nnot well founded. If come upon suddenly, they often strike first, and\r\nif disturbed when in a space so narrow that the coil cannot be formed,\r\nthey may give no warning of their presence beyond the penetration of\r\nthe fangs into the hand or foot of an intruder. One such case I saw.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be well established that a snake will not voluntarily\r\ncrawl over a hair rope, and in certain parts of the country it is\r\ncommon for campers-out to surround their beds with such a rope, since\r\nthe reptiles seek warmth, and are frequently found under or in the\r\nblankets of those sleeping on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter an exceptionally large experience with wounds inflicted by the\r\nfangs of the rattlesnake, and an experience which, I am glad to say,\r\nhas been most successful in its outcome, I think it my duty to add,\r\nfrom a practical standpoint, my testimony as to the efficacy of\r\npermanganate of potassium in the treatment of this class of cases.\r\nThis drug was first introduced by Lacerda, of Brazil, and, if more\r\ngenerally used, would, I believe, render comparatively innocuous a\r\nclass of injury which now usually terminates in death.\r\n\r\nI make this statement as to the fatality of crotalus poison advisedly.\r\nI know the belief is very common that the poison of a rattlesnake is\r\nreadily combated by full doses of whisky. This is fallacious. I have\r\ntaken the pains to investigate a number of instances of cure resulting\r\nfrom the employment of free stimulation. In each case the fangs did\r\nnot penetrate deeply into the tissues, but either scratched over the\r\nsurface or tore through, making a wound of entrance and exit, so that\r\nthe poison, or at least the major part of it, was not injected into\r\nthe tissues of the person struck. The effect is very much the same as\r\nwhen an inexperienced practitioner picks up a fold of skin for the\r\npurpose of making a hypodermic injection, and plunges his needle\r\nentirely through, forcing the medicament wide of his patient.\r\n\r\nNearly all, if not all, of the cases treated by stimulation alone\r\nhave, according to my experience, perished if they have received a\r\nfull dose of virus from a vigorous snake. One of these cases lived for\r\nupward of a month. He then perished of what might be considered a\r\nchronic pyæmia, the symptoms being those of blood poisoning,\r\naccompanied by multiple abscesses. Another case, not occurring in my\r\nown practice, died at the end of four days apparently of cardiac\r\nfailure. Active delirium persisted all through this case. Two other\r\ncases treated by stimulants also died with symptoms of more or less\r\nacute blood poisoning.\r\n\r\nThe feeling is almost universal among the people of Wyoming that a\r\nfair strike from a rattlesnake is certain death, and that the free use\r\nof stimulants simply postpones the end. I do not for a moment deny\r\nthat a strong, lusty man may be struck fairly by a rattlesnake and if\r\nthe wound is at once opened and cauterized, and the heart judiciously\r\nsupported, he may yet recover; still the fact remains that the great\r\nmajority of these cases perish at a longer or shorter interval\r\nfollowing the infliction of the wound. Hence any treatment that will\r\nsave even the majority of such cases is a distinct gain, and one which\r\nhas saved every one of nine cases to which it has been applied needs\r\nno further commendation.\r\n\r\nThe first case of rattlesnake wound to which I was called occurred in\r\n1885. A cow boy was bitten on the foot, the fang penetrating through\r\nthe boot. He was brought forty miles to Fort Fetterman, where I was\r\nthen stationed. I saw him about twenty-four hours after he was struck.\r\nThere was an enormous swelling, extending up to the knee. The whole\r\nlimb was bronzed in appearance. There was no special discoloration\r\nabout the wound; in fact, the swelling disguised this to such an\r\nextent that it was impossible to determine exactly where the fangs had\r\nentered. The pulse was scarcely perceptible at the wrist; the heart\r\nwas beating with excessive rapidity. The patient was suffering great\r\npain. His mind was clear, but he was oppressed with a dreadful\r\nanxiety. Up to the time I saw him he had received absolutely no\r\ntreatment, excepting the application of a cactus poultice to the leg,\r\nsince there was no whisky at the ranch where he was wounded. I at once\r\nmade free incisions, five or six in number, from one to two inches in\r\ndepth, and about three inches in length. These cuts gave him very\r\nlittle pain, nor was there much bleeding, though there was an enormous\r\namount of serous oozing. Into these wounds was poured a fifteen per\r\ncent. solution of permanganate of potassium, and fully half an hour\r\nwas devoted to kneading this drug into the tissues. In addition I made\r\nmany hypodermic injections into all portions of the swollen tissue,\r\nbut particularly about the wound. Since there was no very distinct\r\nline of demarkation between the swollen and healthy tissue, I did not,\r\nas in other cases, endeavor to prevent the extension of the cellular\r\ninvolvement by a complete circle of hypodermic injections. I employed,\r\nin all, about forty grains of the permanganate. In addition to the\r\nlocal treatment I pushed stimulation, employing carbonate of ammonium\r\nand whisky. By means of diuretics and laxatives the kidneys and bowels\r\nwere encouraged to eliminate as much of the poison as possible.\r\n\r\nThe patient went on to uninterrupted recovery. The wound healed with\r\nvery little sloughing. The patient returned to his work in about a\r\nmonth. The cure of this case was regarded by the cow boys as most\r\nexceptional, since, in their experience, similar cases, even though\r\nvery freely stimulated, had not recovered.\r\n\r\nSome time later I was called to see a girl, aged 14, who was struck by\r\na rattlesnake, fifty-six miles from Fort Fetterman. There was some\r\ntrouble about procuring relays, and I was compelled to ride the same\r\nhorse all the way out. This took a little short of five hours. This,\r\ntogether with the time consumed in sending me word, caused an interval\r\nof about twenty hours between the infliction of the injury and the\r\ntime I saw the patient. I found the fangs had entered on either side\r\nof the distal joint of the middle metacarpal bone. The arm was\r\nenormously swollen, almost to the axilla, and exhibited a bronzed\r\ndiscoloration; this was especially marked about the wound and along\r\nthe course of the lymphatics. The swollen area was _boggy_ to the\r\ntouch, and exhibited a distinct line of demarkation between the\r\nhealthy and diseased tissues, excepting along the course of the\r\nbrachial vessels, where the indurated discolored area extended as a\r\nbroad band into the axilliary lymphatics, which were distinctly\r\nswollen. The patient was delirious, was harrassed by terror,\r\ncomplained bitterly of pain, and had an exceedingly feeble, rapid\r\nheart action. There was marked dyspnoea, and all the signs of\r\nimpending dissolution. I at once made free multiple incisions into all\r\nparts of the inflamed tissue, carrying two of my cuts through the\r\nwounds made by the fangs of the snake. In the arm these incisions were\r\nseveral inches long and from one to two inches deep. As in the former\r\ncase, the bleeding was slight, but there was a free exudation of\r\nserum. Into these wounds a fifteen per cent. permanganate of potassium\r\nsolution was poured, and as much as possible was kneaded into the\r\ntissues. In addition multiple hypodermic injections were made, these\r\nbeing carried particularly into the bitten region, and circularly\r\naround the arm just at the border of the line of demarkation, thus\r\nendeavoring to limit by a complete circle of the antiseptic solution\r\nthe further extension of the inflammatory process. In the region of\r\nthe brachial vessels I hesitated to make my injections as thoroughly\r\nas in the rest of the circumference of the arm, fearing lest the\r\npermanganate of potassium might injure important vessels or nerves.\r\n\r\nThis treatment caused very little pain, but immediately after the\r\nconstitutional symptoms became distinctly aggravated. I stimulated\r\nfreely, and at once made preparations to take the patient to the Fort\r\nFetterman hospital. She was transported over the fifty-six miles, I\r\nriding the same horse back again, and arriving at Fort Fetterman the\r\nsame evening.\r\n\r\nThe after treatment of this case was comparatively simple. She was\r\nstimulated freely as long as cardiac weakness was manifested. As in\r\nthe former case, diuretics and laxatives were employed. The arm was\r\nwrapped in cloth soaked in a weak permanganate solution, was placed in\r\na splint, and was loosely bandaged. There was some sloughing, but this\r\nwas treated on general surgical principles. The patient recovered the\r\nentire use of her arm, and was turned out cured in about six weeks.\r\n\r\nThe third case I saw about fourteen hours after he was struck. The\r\npatient was a healthy blacksmith, about 30 years of age. The wound was\r\nat about the middle of the forearm, the fangs entering toward the\r\nulnar side. When I saw the patient he exhibited comparatively trifling\r\nsymptoms. His heart action was rapid, and he was suffering from the\r\ntypical despondency and terror, but I could not note the profound\r\nsystemic depression characteristic of the great majority of cases.\r\nSurrounding the wound and extending up the forearm for several inches\r\nthere was a boggy swelling, exhibiting a sharp line of demarkation. It\r\nwas bronzed in color, and was apparently spreading. I at once applied\r\nthe intermittent ligature just above the elbow, and injected the\r\npermanganate of potassium solution freely all through the involved\r\ntissues, particularly in the region of the bite and about the\r\nperiphery of the swelling, surrounding the latter by a complete ring\r\nof injections.\r\n\r\nThe general treatment of this patient was continued on the same\r\ngeneral line as described in the former cases, stimulants being\r\nemployed moderately. He recovered without any bad symptoms. There was\r\nno sloughing; the swelling disappeared without any necrosis of tissue.\r\nHe is still pursuing his trade in Cheyenne, and suffers from\r\nabsolutely no disability.\r\n\r\nI saw but one case shortly after the wound was inflicted. This patient\r\nwas a healthy young man, who was struck about the middle of the dorsal\r\nsurface of the hand, the fangs entering on each side of a metacarpal\r\nbone, and the poison lodging apparently in the palm of the hand. The\r\npatient, when seen, exhibited the characteristic terror and\r\ndepression, weak, rapid heart action, and agonizing local pain. I made\r\ntwo small incisions in the region of the wound upon the dorsum of the\r\nhand, and injected permanganate of potassium freely. This patient\r\nultimately recovered, but only after sloughing and prolonged\r\nsuppuration. I believe that had I incised freely and at once from the\r\npalmar surface, I would have been spared this unpleasant complication.\r\n\r\nI have had in all nine cases, and without a single death. The others\r\nare in their general features and in the treatment employed quite\r\nsimilar to those given.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms resulting from snake bite poison are strikingly like\r\nthose dependent upon the violent septic poison seen in pre-antiseptic\r\ntimes. There is often the same prodromal chill, the high elevation of\r\ntemperature, the profound effect on the circulation, and the rapid\r\ncellular involvement. The tissue disturbance following snake poisoning\r\ndiffers from ordinary cellulitis, however, in the following\r\nparticulars: The color is _bronze_, not red; the involved area is\r\n_boggy_, not brawny; and the extension of the process is _exceedingly\r\nrapid_.\r\n\r\nThe treatment applicable to one condition seems to be equally\r\nsuccessful when applied to the other. In cellulitis, free incisions,\r\nantiseptic lotions, and active stimulation are the three means upon\r\nwhich the surgeon mainly depends, and in combating the local and\r\ngeneral symptoms excited by snake bite poisoning, the same treatment\r\nhas given me the successful results detailed above. Whether or not\r\npermanganate of potassium is more active than other antiseptics in\r\nsnake bite poisoning I am not prepared to state, but the high\r\nauthority of S. Weir Mitchell, together with my own experience, does\r\nnot incline me to substitute any other drug at present.\r\n\r\nI would formulate the treatment for poison of the rattlesnake as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. Free incisions to the bottom of the wound and immediate\r\ncauterization; or, if this is not practicable, sucking of the wound.\r\n\r\n2. The immediate application of an intermittent tourniquet, that is,\r\none which is relaxed for a moment at a time, so that the poison may\r\ngain admission into the circulation in small doses.\r\n\r\n3. The free administration of alcohol or carbonate of ammonium.\r\n\r\nThis might be termed the _urgency treatment_ of snake bite poisoning.\r\nThe _curative treatment_ requires--\r\n\r\n4. Free incisions into all portions of the inflamed tissues, and the\r\nthorough kneading into these incisions of a fifteen per cent. solution\r\nof permanganate of potassium.\r\n\r\n5. Multiple injections of the same solution into all the inflamed\r\nregions, but particularly into the region of the wound.\r\n\r\n6. The complete surrounding of all the involved tissues, by\r\npermanganate of potassium injections placed from half an inch to an\r\ninch apart, the needle being driven into the healthy tissue just\r\nbeyond the line of demarkation, and its point being carried to the\r\ndeepest part of the border of the indurated area.\r\n\r\n7. The permanganate of potassium solution should be used freely in\r\nfifteen per cent. solution. I have used one and a half drachms of the\r\npure drug diluted, and would not hesitate to use four times that\r\nquantity were it necessary, since it seems to exert no deleterious\r\neffect, either locally or generally.\r\n\r\n8. The involved area should be dressed by means of lint saturated with\r\nfifteen per cent. permanganate of potassium solution. Stimulants\r\nshould be given according to the indications--i.e., the condition of\r\nthe pulse. Laxatives, diuretics, and diaphoretics should be\r\nadministered to aid in the elimination of the poison. The diet should\r\nbe as nutritious as the stomach can digest.--_The Therapeutic\r\nGazette_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHINESE COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWuchang, on the Yangtsze opposite Hankow, is the capital of the two\r\nprovinces Hupeh and Hunan. Here, every third year, the examination for\r\ncompetitors from both provinces is held, and a correspondent of the\r\n_North China Herald_, of Shanghai, describes the scene at the\r\nexamination at the beginning of September last. The streets, he says,\r\nare thronged with long-robed, large-spectacled gentlemen, who inform\r\nthe world at large by every fold of drapery, every swagger of gait,\r\nevery curve of nail, that they are the aristocracy of the most ancient\r\nempire of the world. Wuchang had from 12,000 to 15,000 bachelors of\r\narts within its walls, who came from the far borders of the province\r\nfor the examination for the provincial degree. About one-half per\r\ncent. will be successful; thousands of them know they have not the\r\nshadow of a chance, but literary etiquette binds them to appear. In\r\nthe wake of these Confucian scholars come a rout of traders, painters,\r\nscroll sellers, teapot venders, candle merchants, spectacle mongers,\r\netc.; servants and friends swell the number, so that the examination\r\nmakes a difference of some 40,000 or 50,000 to the resident\r\npopulation. In the great examination hall, which is composed of a\r\nseries of pens shut off from each other in little rows of 20 or 30,\r\nand the view of which is suggestive of a huge cattle market, there is\r\naccommodation for over 10,000 candidates. The observance of rules of\r\nacademic propriety is very strict. A candidate may be excluded, not\r\nonly for incompetence, but for writing his name in the wrong place,\r\nfor tearing or blotting his examination paper, etc. After the\r\nexamination of each batch a list of those allowed to compete for\r\nhonors is published, and the essay forms for each district are\r\nprepared with proper names and particulars. The ancestors of the\r\ncandidate for three generations must be recorded, they must be free\r\nfrom taint of _yamen_ service, prostitution, the barber's trade and\r\nthe theater, or the candidate would not have obtained his first\r\ndegree. With the forms 300 cash (about 1s.) are presented to each\r\ncandidate for food during the ordeal. The lists being thus prepared,\r\non the sixth day of the eighth moon (Tuesday, the 8th of September, in\r\n1891), the city takes a holiday to witness the ceremony of \"entering\r\nthe curtain,\" i.e., opening the examination hall. For days coolies\r\nhave been pumping water into great tanks, droves of pigs have been\r\ndriven into the inclosure, doctors, tailors, cooks, coffins, printers,\r\netc., have been massed within the hall for possible needs. The\r\nimperial commissioners are escorted by the examination officials to\r\nthe place. A dozen district magistrates have been appointed to\r\nsuperintend within the walls, and as many more outside, two prefects\r\nhave office inside, and the governor of the province has also to be\r\nlocked up during the eight days of examination. The whole company is\r\nfirst entertained to breakfast at the _yamen_, and then the procession\r\nforms; the ordinary umbrellas, lictors, gongs, feathers, and\r\nragamuffins are there in force; the examiners and the highest officers\r\nare carried in open chairs draped in scarlet and covered with tiger\r\nskins. The dead silence that falls on the crowd betokens the approach\r\nof the governor, who brings up the rear. Then the bustle of the actual\r\nexamination begins. The hall is a miniature city. Practically martial\r\nlaw is proclaimed. In the central tower is a sword, and misdemeanor\r\nwithin the limits is punished with instant death. The mandarins take\r\nup their quarters in their respective lodges, the whole army of\r\nwriters whose duty it is to copy out the essays of the candidates, to\r\nprevent collusion, take their places. Altogether there must be over\r\n20,000 people shut in. Cases have been known in which a hopeful\r\ncandidate was crushed to death in the crowd at the gate. Each\r\ncandidate is first identified, and he is assigned a certain number\r\nwhich corresponds to a cell a few feet square, containing one board\r\nfor a seat and one for a desk. Meanwhile the printers in the building\r\nare hard at work printing the essay texts. Each row of cells has two\r\nattendants for cooking, etc., assigned to it, the candidates take\r\ntheir seats, the rows are locked from the outside, the themes are\r\nhanded out, the contest has begun. The examination is divided into\r\nthree bouts of about 36 hours, two nights and a day, each, with\r\nintervals of a day. The first is the production of three essays on the\r\nfour assigned books; the second of five essays on the five classics;\r\nthe third of five essays on miscellaneous subjects. The strain, as may\r\nbe imagined, is very great, and several victims die in the hall. The\r\nliterary ambition which leads old men of 60 and 70 to enter not\r\nunfrequently destroys them. Should any fatal case occur, the coffin\r\nmay on no account be carried out through the gates; it must be lifted\r\nover or sometimes through a breach in the wall. Death must not pollute\r\nthe great entrance. At the end of the third trial, the first batch of\r\nthose who have completed their essays is honored with the firing of\r\nguns, the bows of the officials, and the ministry of a band of music.\r\nThree weeks of anxious waiting will ensue before a huge crowd will\r\nassemble to see the list published. Then the successful candidates are\r\nthe pride of their country side, and well do the survivors of such an\r\nordeal deserve their credit. The case of those who are in the last\r\nselection and are left degreeless, for the stern reason that some must\r\nbe crowded out, is the hardest of all.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGH SPEED ENGINE AND DYNAMO.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe illustrate a high speed engine and dynamo constructed by Easton &\r\nAnderson, London. This plant was used at the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety's show at Doncaster in testing the machinery in the dairy, and\r\nconstituted a distinct innovation, as well as an improvement, on the\r\nappliances previously employed for the purpose. The separator, or\r\nwhatever might be the machine under trial, was driven by an electric\r\nmotor fed by a current from the dynamo we illustrate. A record was\r\nmade of the volts and amperes used, and from this the power expended\r\nwas deduced, the motor having been previously carefully calibrated by\r\nmeans of a brake. So delicate was the test that the observers could\r\ndetect the presence of a warm bearing in the separator from the change\r\nin the readings of the ammeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED HIGH SPEED ENGINE AND DYNAMO.]\r\n\r\nThe engine is carefully balanced to enable it to run at the very high\r\nspeed of 500 revolutions per minute. The cranks are opposite each\r\nother, and the moving parts connected with the two pistons are of the\r\nsame weight. The result is complete absence of vibration, and\r\nexceedingly quiet running. Very liberal lubricating arrangements are\r\nfitted to provide for long runs, while uniformity of speed is provided\r\nfor by a Pickering governor. The high pressure cylinder is 4 in. in\r\ndiameter, and the low pressure cylinder is 7 in. in diameter. The\r\nstroke in each case is 4 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe dynamo is designed to feed sixty lamps of 16 candle power each,\r\nthe current being 60 amperes at 50 volts. The armature is of the drum\r\ntype. The peculiar feature of it is that grooves are planed in the\r\nlaminated core from end to end, and in these grooves the conductors,\r\nwhich are of ribbon section, are laid. Slips of insulating material\r\nare laid between the coils and the dovetailed mouths of the grooves\r\nare closed with bone or vulcanized fiber, or other dielectric. At each\r\nend of the core there are fitted non-magnetic covers. At the\r\ncommutator end the cover is like a truncated cone, and incloses the\r\nconnections completely. One end of the cone is supported on the end\r\nplate of the armature and the other end on a ring on the commutator. A\r\nbell-shaped cover incloses the conductors at the other end of the\r\narmature. The result is that the conductors are completely incased,\r\nprotected from all mechanical injury, and positively driven. They can\r\nneither be displaced nor abraded. The conductors on the magnet coils\r\nare likewise carefully protected from harm by metal coverings. These\r\ndynamos are made in sixteen sizes, of which seven sizes are designed\r\nto feed more than 100 lamps, the largest serving for 600 lamps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\nMessrs. Easton & Anderson are showing machinery of this type at the\r\nCrystal Palace Electrical Exhibition now open in\r\nLondon.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLORINE GAS AND SODA BY THE ELECTROLYTIC PROCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of a solution of common salt, and its conversion\r\ninto chlorine gas and caustic soda solution by means of an electric\r\ncurrent, has long been a study with electro-chemists. Experimentally\r\nit has often been effected, but so far as we are aware, the success of\r\nthis method of production has never until now been demonstrated on a\r\nsound commercial basis. The solution of this important industrial\r\nproblem is due to Mr. James Greenwood, who has been engaged in the\r\ndevelopment of electro-chemical processes for many years. The outcome\r\nof this is that Mr. Greenwood has now perfected an electrolytic\r\nprocess for the direct production of caustic soda and chlorine, as\r\nwell as other chemical products, the operation of which we recently\r\ninspected at Phoenix Wharf, Battersea, London. One of the special\r\nfeatures in connection with Mr. Greenwood's new departure is the novel\r\nand ingenious method by which the electrolyzed products are separated,\r\nand their recombination rendered impossible. This object is attained\r\nby the use of a specially constructed diaphragm which is composed of a\r\nseries of V-shaped glass troughs, fitted in a frame within each other\r\nwith a small space between them, which is lightly packed with asbestos\r\nfiber. Another important feature of the apparatus is a compound anode\r\nwhich consists of carbon plates, with a metal core to increase the\r\nconductivity. The anode is treated in a special manner so as to render\r\nit non-porous and impervious to attack by the nascent chlorine evolved\r\non its surface. No anode appears ever to have been invented that is at\r\nall suitable for working on a large scale, and the successful\r\nintroduction of this compound anode, therefore, constitutes a marked\r\nadvance in the apparatus used in electrolytic methods of production.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus by which the new process is being successfully\r\ndemonstrated on a working scale has been put up by the Caustic Soda\r\nand Chlorine Syndicate, London, and has been in operation for several\r\nmonths past. The installation consists of five large electrolytic\r\nvessels, each of which is fitted up with five anodes and six cathodes\r\narranged alternately. The anodes and cathodes are separated by the\r\nspecial diaphragms, and each vessel is thus divided into ten anode or\r\nchlorine sections and ten cathode or caustic soda sections. The anodes\r\nand cathodes in each vessel are connected up in parallel similar to an\r\nordinary storage battery, but the five electrolytic vessels are\r\nconnected up in series. The current is produced by an Elwell-Parker\r\ndynamo, and the electromotive force required to overcome the\r\nresistance of each vessel is about 4.4 volts, with a current density\r\nof 10 amperes per square foot of electrode surface. The anode\r\nsections, numbering fifty altogether, are connected by means of tubes,\r\nthe inlet being at the bottom and the outlet at the top of each\r\nsection. The whole of the cathode sections are connected in the same\r\nmanner. In commencing operations, the electrolytic vessels are charged\r\nwith a solution of common salt, through which a current of electricity\r\nis then passed, thus decomposing or splitting up the salt into its\r\nelements, chlorine and sodium. In the separation of the sodium,\r\nhowever, a secondary action takes place, which converts it into\r\ncaustic soda. An automatic circulation of the solutions is maintained\r\nby placing the charging tanks at a slight elevation, and the vessels\r\nthemselves on platforms arranged in steps. The solutions are pumped\r\nback from the lowest vessel to their respective charging tanks, the\r\nsalt solution to be further decomposed and the caustic soda solution\r\nto be further concentrated. The chlorine gas evolved in the fifty\r\nanode sections is conveyed by means of main and branch tubes into\r\nseveral absorbers, in which milk of lime, kept in a state of\r\nagitation, takes up the chlorine, thus making it into bleaching or\r\nchlorate liquor as may be required. If the chlorine is required to be\r\nmade into bleaching powder, then it is conveyed into leaden chambers\r\nand treated with lime in the usual manner. The caustic soda formed in\r\nthe fifty cathode sections is more or less concentrated according to\r\nthe particular purpose for which it may be required. If, however, the\r\ncaustic soda is required in solid form, and practically free from\r\nsalt, then the caustic alkaline liquor is transferred from the\r\nelectrolytic vessels to evaporating pans, where it is concentrated to\r\nthe required strength by evaporation and at the same time the salt\r\nremaining in the solution is eliminated by precipitation.\r\n\r\nSuch is the method of manufacturing caustic soda and chlorine by this\r\nprocess, which will doubtless have a most important bearing upon many\r\ntrades and manufactures, more particularly upon the paper, soap, and\r\nbleaching industries. But the invention does not stop where we have\r\nleft it, for it is stated that the process can be applied to the\r\nproduction of sodium amalgam and chlorine for extracting gold and\r\nother metals from their ores. It can also be utilized in the\r\nproduction of caustic and chlorate of potash and other chemicals,\r\nwhich can be manufactured in a state of the greatest purity. A very\r\nimportant consideration is that of cost, for upon this depends\r\ncommercial success. It is therefore satisfactory to learn that the\r\ncost of production has been determined by the most careful electrical\r\nand analytical tests, which demonstrate an economy of over 50 per\r\ncent. as compared with present methods. Highly favorable reports on\r\nthe process have been made by Dr. G. Gore, F.R.S., the eminent\r\nauthority on electro-chemical processes, by Mr. W.H. Preece, F.R.S.,\r\nand by Messrs. Cross & Bevan, consulting chemists. Dr. Gore states\r\nthat the chemical and electrical principles upon which this process is\r\nbased are thoroughly sound, and that the process is of a\r\nscientifically practical character. Should, however, the economy of\r\nproduction even fall somewhat below the anticipations of those who\r\nhave examined into the process very carefully, it can hardly fail to\r\nprove as successful commercially as it has scientifically.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLETION OF THE MERSEY TUNNEL RAILWAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of January (says the _Liverpool Daily Post_) will be\r\nopened for traffic the new station of the Mersey Tunnel Railway at the\r\nbottom of Bold Street. With the completion of the station at Bold\r\nStreet the scheme may be said to have been brought successfully to a\r\nconclusion. It was not until 1879, after the expenditure of\r\n125,000_l._ upon trial borings, that the promoters ventured to appeal\r\nto the public for support, and that a company, of which the Right Hon.\r\nH. Cecil Raikes, M.P., was chairman, was formed for carrying the\r\nproject of the Mersey Railway into effect. The experience of the\r\nengineers in the construction of the tunnel is not a little curious.\r\nIt was proved by the borings that the position in which the tunnel was\r\nproposed to be bored was not only the most important from the point of\r\nview of public convenience, and therefore of commercial advantage, but\r\nwas from the point of view of engineering difficulty decidedly the\r\nmost preferable. In this position the cuttings passed through the\r\nsandstone rock, although on the Liverpool side the shafts were sunk\r\nthrough a considerable depth through \"made\" ground, the whole of Mann\r\nIsland and the Goree being composed of earth and gravel tipped on the\r\nold bank of the river. Indeed the miners passed through the cellars of\r\nold houses and unearthed old water pipes; excavated through a depth of\r\ntipped rubbish on which these houses had evidently been built; and\r\nthen came upon the former strand of the river, beneath which was the\r\nblue silt usually found; then a stratum of bowlder clay; and finally\r\nthe red sandstone rock. Once begun, the works were pushed forward\r\nnight and day, Sundays excepted, until January, 1884, when the last\r\nfew feet of rock were cleared away by the boring machine, and the\r\nmayors of Liverpool and Birkenhead met in fraternal greeting beneath\r\nthe river. The operations gave employment to 3,000 men working three\r\nshifts of eight hours each, but were greatly accelerated by the use of\r\nColonel Beaumont's boring machine, on which disks of chilled iron are\r\nset in a strong iron bar made to revolve by means of compressed air.\r\nThis machine scooped out a tunnel 7 feet in diameter; and by\r\nsuccessive improvements Colonel Beaumont attained a speed of 150 feet\r\nper week, leaving the old method of blasting far behind. As the\r\nmachine moved forward the rock behind was broken out to the size of\r\nthe main tunnel and bricked in in short lengths. One remarkable\r\ncircumstance in connection with the work is that the boring from the\r\nBirkenhead side and the boring from Liverpool were found, when they\r\nwere completed and joined, to be out of line by only 1 inch.\r\n\r\nThis excellent result was attained by careful calculations and\r\nexperiments with perpendicular wires kept in position by weights,\r\nwhich, to avoid oscillation, were suspended in buckets of water. From\r\nshaft to shaft the tunnel is 1,770 yards in length and 26 feet in\r\ndiameter; but for a length of 400 feet at the James Street and\r\nHamilton Square stations the arch is enlarged to 50½ feet. The tunnel\r\nis lined with from six to eight rings of solid brickwork embedded in\r\ncement, the two inner rings being blue Staffordshire or Burnley\r\nbricks. For the purpose of ventilation a smaller tunnel, 7 feet in\r\ndiameter, was bored parallel with the main tunnel, with which it is\r\nconnected in eight places by cross cuts, provided with suitable doors.\r\nBoth at Liverpool and at Birkenhead there are two guibal fans, one 40\r\nfeet and the other 30 feet in diameter. The smaller, which throw each\r\n180,000 cubic feet of air per minute, ventilate the continuations of\r\nthe tunnel under Liverpool and Birkenhead respectively, and the larger\r\ntunnel under the river. The fans remove together 600,000 cubic feet of\r\nair per minute, and by this combined operation the entire air in the\r\ntunnel is changed once in every seven minutes. By the use of\r\nregulating shutters the air passes in a continuous current and the\r\nfans are noiseless. The telegraph and telephone wires pass through the\r\ntunnel, thus avoiding the long detour by Runcorn. Probably, as a feat\r\nof engineering, the construction of the new station at Bold Street is\r\nnot inferior to any part of the scheme advanced. Under very singular\r\nand perplexing difficulties it could only be proceeded with in its\r\nfirst stages from midnight until six o'clock the following morning, it\r\nbeing of course essential that the traffic at the Central Station\r\nshould not be interfered with. During these hours, night after night,\r\ntrenches were cut at intervals of 10 feet across the roadway\r\nconnecting the arrival platforms at the station, and into these were\r\nplaced strong balks of timber, across which planks were laid as a\r\ntemporary roadway. Beneath these planks, which were taken up and put\r\ndown as required, the rock was excavated to a depth of 9 feet, and the\r\nbalks supported upon stout props. Then from the driftway or rough\r\nboring beneath well holes were bored to the upper excavation, and\r\nthrough them the strong upright iron pillars designed to support the\r\nroof of the new tunnel station were passed, bedded and securely fixed\r\nin position. No sooner were they _in situ_ than the most troublesome\r\npart of the task was entered upon, for the balks had then to be\r\nremoved in order to allow to be placed in position the girders running\r\nthe length of the new station, and resting on the tops of the upright\r\npillars. From these longitudinal girders cross girders of great\r\nstrength were placed, and between these were built brick arches,\r\npacked above with concrete. This formed the roof of the new station.\r\nOne portion of it passed under the rails in the station above, and had\r\nto be constructed without stoppage of the traffic. The rails had\r\nconsequently to be supported on a temporary steel bridge of ingenious\r\ndesign, constructed by Mr. C.A. Rowlendson, the resident engineer and\r\nmanager of the company, under whose personal supervision, as\r\nrepresenting Sir Douglas Fox, the work has been carried out. With this\r\ndevice the men were enabled to go on in safety although locomotives\r\nwere passing immediately above their heads. After the completion of\r\nthe roof the station below was excavated by what is technically called\r\n\"plug and feather\" work--that is to say, by drilling holes into which\r\npowerful wedges are driven to split the rock.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STEAM STREET RAILWAY MOTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: North Chicago Street Railroad Engine]\r\n\r\nWhile in Paris, President Yerkes, of the North Chicago Street Railway\r\nCompany, purchased a noiseless steam motor, the results in\r\nexperimenting with which will be watched with great interest. The\r\naccompanying engraving, for which we are indebted to the _Street\r\nRailway Review_, gives a very accurate idea of the general external\r\nappearance. The car is all steel throughout, except windows, doors and\r\nceiling. It is 12 ft. long, 8 ft. wide, and 9 ft. high, and weighs\r\nabout seven tons. The engines, which have 25 horse power and are of\r\nthe double cylinder pattern, are below the floor and connected\r\ndirectly to the wheels. The wheels are four in number and 31 in. in\r\ndiameter. The internal appearance and general arrangement of\r\nmachinery, etc., is about that of the ordinary steam dummy. It will\r\nrun in either direction, and the exhaust steam is run through a series\r\nof mufflers which suppress the sound, condense the steam and return\r\nthe water to the boiler, which occupies the center of the car. The\r\nmotor was built in Ghent, Belgium, and cost about $5,000, custom house\r\nduties amounting to about $2,000 more.--_The Railway Review_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWENTY-FOUR KNOT STEAMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the most important form of steam machinery is the marine\r\nengine, not only because of the conditions under which it works, but\r\nbecause of the great power it is called upon to exert. Naturally its\r\nmost interesting application is to Atlantic steaming. The success of\r\nthe four great liners, Teutonic, Majestic, City of Paris and City of\r\nNew York, has stimulated demand, and the Cunard Company has resolved\r\nto add to its fleet, and place two ships on the Atlantic which will\r\noutstrip the racers we have named.\r\n\r\nThe visitor to the late Naval Exhibition interested in shipping will\r\nhave remarked at each of the several exhibits of the great firms a\r\nmodel of a projected steamer, intended to reduce the present record of\r\nthe six days' voyage across the Atlantic--the _ne plus ultra_ at this\r\ntime of steam navigation. To secure this present result a continuous\r\nsteaming for the six days at 20 knot speed is requisite, not to\r\nmention an extra day or two at each end of the voyage. The City of\r\nParis and the City of New York, Furst Bismarck, Teutonic and Majestic\r\nare capable of this, with the Umbria and Etruria close behind at 18 to\r\n19 knots. Only ten years ago the average passage, reckoned in the same\r\nway as from land to land--or Queenstown to Sandy Hook--was seven days\r\nwith a speed of 17 knots, the performance of such vessels as the\r\nArizona and Alaska. Twenty years ago the length of the voyage was\r\nestimated as seven and a half to eight days at a speed of 16 knots,\r\nthe performance of such vessels as the Germanic and Britannic of the\r\nWhite Star fleet of 5,000 tons and 5,000 horse power. Thirty years ago\r\nthe paddle steamer was not yet driven off the ocean, and we find the\r\nScotia crossing in between eight and nine days, at a speed of 13 or 14\r\nknots. In 1858 ten and a half to twelve and a half days was allowed\r\nfor the passage between Liverpool and New York. So as we recede we\r\nfinally arrive at the pioneer vessels, the Sirius and Great Western,\r\ncrossing in fourteen to eighteen days at a speed of 6 to 8 knots. For\r\nthese historical details an interesting paper may be consulted, \"De\r\nToenemende Grootte der Zee-Stoombooten,\" 1888, by Professor A. Huet,\r\nof the Delft Polytechnic School.\r\n\r\nEach of the last two or three decades has thus succeeded, always,\r\nhowever, with increasing difficulty, in knocking off a day from the\r\nduration of the voyage. But although the present six-day 20 knot boats\r\nare of extreme size and power, and date only from the last two or\r\nthree years, still the world of travelers declares itself unsatisfied.\r\nAlready we hear that another day must be struck off, and that five-day\r\nsteamers have become a necessity of modern requirements, keeping up a\r\ncontinuous ocean speed of 23½ knots to 24 knots. Shipbuilders and\r\nengineers are ashamed to mention the word _impossible_; and designers\r\nare already at work, as we saw in the Naval Exhibition, but only so\r\nfar in the model stage; as the absence of any of the well known\r\ndistinguishing blazons of the foremost lines was sufficient to show\r\nthat no order had been placed for the construction of a real vessel.\r\nIt will take a very short time to examine the task of the naval\r\narchitect required to secure these onerous and magnificent conditions,\r\nfive days' continuous ocean steaming at a speed of 24 knots.\r\n\r\nThe most practical, theory-despising among them must for the nonce\r\nbecome a theorist, and argue from the known to the unknown; and,\r\nfirst, the practical man will turn--secretly perhaps, but wisely--to\r\nthe invaluable experiments and laws laid down so clearly by the late\r\nMr. Froude. Although primarily designed to assist the Admiralty in\r\narguing from the resistance of a model to that of the full size\r\nvessel, the practical man need not thereby despise Froude's laws, as\r\nhe is able to choose his mode: to any scale he likes, and he can take\r\nhis experiments ready made by practice on a large scale, as Newton\r\ntook the phenomena of astronomy for the illustration of the mechanical\r\nlaws. Suppose then he takes the City of Paris as his model, 560 ft. by\r\n63 ft., in round numbers 10,000 tons displacement, and 20,000 horse\r\npower, for a speed of 20 knots, with a coal capacity of 2,000 tons,\r\nsufficient, with contingencies, for a voyage of six to eight days. Or\r\nwe may take a later 20 knot vessel, the Furst Bismarck, 500 ft. by\r\n50ft., 8,000 tons, and 16,000 horse power, speed 20 knots, and coal\r\ncapacity 2,700 tons, to allow for the entire length of voyage to\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn Froude's method of comparison the laws of mechanical similitude are\r\npreserved if we make the displacements of the model and of its copy in\r\nthe ratio of the sixth power of the speeds designed, or the length as\r\nthe square of the speed. Our new 24 knot vessel, taking the City of\r\nParis as a model, would therefore have 10,000 (24 ÷ 20)^{6} = 29,860,\r\nsay 30,000 tons displacement, and would be 800 ft. × 90 ft. in\r\ndimensions. The horse power would have to be as the _seventh_ power of\r\nthe speed, and our vessel would therefore have 20,000 (24 ÷ 20)^{7},\r\nor say 72,000 horse power. Further applications of Froude's laws of\r\nsimilitude will show that the steam pressure and piston speed would\r\nhave to be raised 20 per cent., while the revolutions were discounted\r\n20 per cent., supposing the engines and propellers to be increased in\r\nsize to scale. To provide the requisite enormous boiler power, all\r\ngeometrical scale would disappear; but it would carry us too far at\r\npresent to follow up this interesting comparison.\r\n\r\nOur naval architect is not likely at present to proceed further with\r\nthis monstrous design, exceeding even the Great Eastern in size, if\r\nonly because no dock is in existence capable of receiving such a ship.\r\nHe has however learned something of value, namely, that this vessel,\r\nif the proper similitude is carried out, is capable of keeping up a\r\nspeed of 24 knots for five days with ample coal supply, provided the\r\nboilers are not found to occupy all the available space. For it is an\r\nimmediate consequence of Froude's laws that in similar vessels run at\r\ncorresponding speeds over the same voyage, the coal capacity is\r\nproportionately the same, or that a ton of coal will carry the same\r\nnumber of tons of displacement over the same distance. Thus our\r\nenlarged City of Paris would require to carry about 4,000 tons of\r\ncoal, burning 800 tons a day.\r\n\r\nWith the Britannic and Germanic as models of 5,000 tons and 5,000\r\nhorse power at 16 knot speed, the 24 knot vessel would require to be\r\nof 57,000 tons and 85,000 horse power, to carry sufficient coal for\r\nthe voyage of 3,000 miles. These enormous vessels being out of the\r\nquestion, the designer must reduce the size. But now the City of Paris\r\nwill no longer serve as a model, he must look elsewhere for a vessel\r\nof high speed, and smaller scale, and naturally he picks out a torpedo\r\nboat at the other end of the scale. A speed of 24 knots--and it is\r\nclaimed even of 25, 26, and 27 knots--has been attained on the mile by\r\na torpedo boat. But such a performance is useless for our mode of\r\ncomparison, as sufficient fuel at this high speed for ten or twelve\r\nhours only at most can be carried--a voyage of, say, 500 miles; while\r\nour steamer is required to carry coal for 3,000 miles. The Russian\r\ntorpedo boat Wiborg, for instance, is designed to carry coal for 1,200\r\nmiles at 10 knot speed; but at 20 knots this fuel would last only\r\ntwenty-seven hours, carrying the vessel 540 miles. It will now be\r\nfound that with this limited coal capacity the speed of the ordinary\r\ntorpedo boat must be reduced considerably below 10 knots for it to be\r\nable to cross the Atlantic, 3,000 miles under steam. So that, even at\r\na possible speed of 10 knots for the voyage, the full sized 24 knot\r\nfive-day vessel, of which the best torpedo boat is the model, must\r\nhave (2.4)^{6}, say 200 times the tonnage, and (2.4)^{7}, or 460 times\r\nthe horse power. The enlarged Wiborg would thus not differ much from\r\nthe enlarged City of Paris. A better model to select would be one of\r\nthe recent dispatch boats, commerce destroyers, or torpedo catchers,\r\nrecently designed by Mr. W.H. White, for our navy--the Intrepid or\r\nEndymion, for instance. The Intrepid is 300 ft. by 44 ft., 3,600 tons,\r\nand 9,000 horse power for 20 knot speed, with 800 hours' coal capacity\r\nfor 8,000 miles at 10 knot speed; which will reduce to 3,000 miles at\r\n16 knots, and 2,000 miles at 20 knots.\r\n\r\nThe Endymion is 360 ft. by 60 ft., with coal capacity for 2,800 miles\r\nat 18 knot speed, or for about 144 hours or six days. The enlarged\r\nEndymion for the same voyage of 2,800 miles in five days, or at 21½\r\nknot speed, would be 44 per cent larger and broader, that is 520 ft.\r\nby 86 ft., and of threefold tonnage, and three and a half times, or\r\nabout 30,000 horse power--about the dimensions of the Furst Bismarck,\r\nbut much more powerfully engined. This agrees fairly with the estimate\r\nin the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN of 19th Sept, 1891., where it is stated\r\nthat twenty-two boilers, at a working pressure of 180 lb. on the\r\nsquare inch, would be required, allowing 1½ lb. of coal per horse\r\npower hour.\r\n\r\nThe Intrepid, enlarged to a 24 knot boat, for the same length of\r\nvoyage of 3,000 miles, would be 650 ft. by 100 ft., 40,000 tons, and\r\nabout 45,000 horse power. So now we are nearing the Messrs. Thomson\r\ndesign in the Naval Exhibition of the five-day steamer, 23½ knot\r\nspeed, 630 ft. by 73 ft., and 30,000 to 40,000 horse power.\r\n\r\nNo one doubts the ability of our shipbuilding yards to turn out these\r\nmonsters; and on the measured mile, and for a good long distance, we\r\nshall certainly see the contract speeds attained and some excelled.\r\nBut the whole difficulty turns on the question of the coal capacity,\r\nand whether it is sufficient to last for even five days or for 3,000\r\nmiles. Every effort then must be made to shorten the length of the\r\nvoyage from port to port; and we may yet see Galway and Halifax, only\r\n2,200 miles apart, once more mentioned as the starting points of the\r\nvoyage as of old, in the earliest days of steam navigation. In those\r\ndays the question of fuel supply was a difficulty, even at the then\r\nslow speeds, in consequence of the wasteful character of the engines,\r\nburning from 7 lb. of coal and upward per horse power hour. Dr.\r\nLardner's calculations, based upon the average performance of those\r\ndays, justified him in saying that steam navigation could not pay--as\r\nwas really the case until the introduction of the compound engine.\r\n\r\nIt is recorded in Admiral Preble's \"Origin and Development of Steam\r\nNavigation,\" Philadelphia, 1883, page 160, that the Sirius, 700 tons\r\nand 320 horse power, on her return voyage had to burn up all that old\r\nbe spared on board, and took seventeen days to reach Falmouth. An\r\ninteresting old book to consult now is Atherton's \"Tables of Steamship\r\nCapacity,\" 1854, based as they are upon the performance of the marine\r\nengine of the day. Atherton calculates that a 10,000 ton vessel could\r\nat 20 knots carry only 204 tons of cargo 1,676 miles, while a 5,000\r\nton vessel at 18 knots on a voyage of 3,000 miles could carry no cargo\r\nat all. Also that the cost per ton of cargo at 16 knots would be\r\ntwenty times the cost at eight knots, implying a coal consumption\r\nreaching to 12 lb. per horse power hour. It is quite possible that\r\nsome invention is still latent which will enable us to go considerably\r\nbelow the present average consumption of 2 lb. to 1½ lb. per horse\r\npower hour; but at present our rate of progress appears asymptotic to\r\na definite limit.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the whole difficulty is one of fuel supply, and it is\r\nuseless to employ a fast torpedo boat as our model, except at the\r\nspeed at which the torpedo boat can carry her own fuel to cross the\r\nAtlantic. If the voyage must be reduced in time, let it be reduced\r\nfrom six days to four, by running between Galway and Halifax, a\r\nproblem not too extravagant in its demands for modern engineering\r\ncapabilities. A statement has recently gained a certain amount of\r\ncirculation to the effect that the Inman Company was about to use\r\npetroleum as fuel, in order to obtain more steam. We have the best\r\npossible authority for saying there is not the least syllable of truth\r\nin this rumor. It has also been stated that since solid piston valves\r\nhave been fitted to the Teutonic in lieu of the original spring ring\r\nvalves, she has steamed faster. This rumor is only partially true. Her\r\nrecord, outward passage, of 5 days 16 hours 31 minutes, was made on\r\nher previous voyage. She has, however, since made her three fastest\r\ntrips homeward.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILITARY ENGINEER AND HIS WORK.[1]\r\n\r\nBy Col. W.R. KING.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A lecture delivered before the students of Sibley\r\nCollege, Cornell University, December 4, 1891.--_The Crank_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy matter to present a dry subject in such an\r\nattractive form as to excite a thrilling interest in it, and military\r\nscience is no exception to this rule. An ingenious military instructor\r\nat one of our universities has succeeded in pointing out certain\r\nanalogies between grand tactics and the festive game of football,\r\nwhich appears to have greatly improved the football, if we may judge\r\nfrom the recent victories of the blue over the red and the black and\r\norange, but it is not so clear that the effect of the union has been\r\nvery beneficial to military science; and even if such had been the\r\ncase, I fear there are no similar analogies that would be useful in\r\nenlivening the subject of military engineering.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times of which we have record man has been disposed\r\nto strive with his fellow man, either to maintain his own rights or to\r\npossess himself of some rights or material advantage enjoyed by\r\nothers. When one or only a few men encroach on the rights of others in\r\nan organized community, they may be restrained by the legal machinery\r\nof the state, such as courts, police, and prisons, but when a whole\r\ncommunity or state rises against another, the civil law becomes\r\npowerless and a state of war ensues. It is not proposed here to\r\ndiscuss the ethics of this question, nor the desirability of providing\r\na suitable court of nations for settling all international\r\ndifficulties without war. The great advantage of such a system of\r\navoiding war is admitted by all intelligent people. We notice here a\r\nsingular inconsistency in the principles upon which this strife is\r\ncarried on, viz.: If it be a single combat, either a friendly contest\r\nor a deadly one, the parties are expected to contest on equal terms as\r\nnearly as may be arranged; but if large numbers are engaged, or in\r\nother words, when the contest becomes war, the rule is reversed and\r\neach party is expected to take every possible advantage of his\r\nadversary, even to the extent of stratagem or deception. In fact, it\r\nhas passed into a proverb that \"all things are fair in love and war.\"\r\n\r\nNow one of the first things resorted to, in order to gain an advantage\r\nover the enemy, was to bring in material appliances, such as walls,\r\nditches, catapults, scaling ladders, battering rams, and subsequently\r\nthe more modern appliances, such as guns, forts, and torpedoes, all of\r\nwhich are known as engines of war, and the men who built and operated\r\nthese engines were very naturally called engineers. It is this kind of\r\nan artificer that Shakespeare refers to when he playfully suggests\r\nthat \"'tis the sport to have the engineer hoist with his own petard.\"\r\n\r\nThe early military engineer has left ample records and monuments of\r\nhis genius. The walls of ancient cities, castles that still crown many\r\nhills in both hemispheres, the great Chinese wall, the historical\r\nbridge of Julius Cæsar, which with charming simplicity he tells us was\r\nbuilt because it did not comport with his dignity to cross the stream\r\nin boats, the bridge of boats across the Hellespont, by Xerxes, are\r\nall examples of early military engineering. The Bible tells us \"King\r\nUzziah built towers at the gates of Jerusalem, and at the turning of\r\nthe wall, and fortified them.\" We may note in passing that the\r\nbuttresses, battlements, and bartizans with which our modern\r\narchitects ornament or disfigure churches, peaceful dwellings, and\r\npublic buildings, are copied from the early works of the military\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nComing down to the military engineers of our own country, we find that\r\none of the first acts of the Continental Congress, after appointing\r\nWashington as commander-in-chief, was to authorize him to employ a\r\nnumber of engineers. It was not, however, until 1777 that a number of\r\nengineer officers from the French army arrived in this country, and\r\nwere appointed in the Continental army. General DuPortail was made\r\nChief Engineer, and Colonel Kosciusko, the great Polish patriot, was\r\namong his assistants. Other officers of the Continental army were\r\nemployed on engineering duty; and under their supervision such works\r\nas the forts and the great chain barrier at West Point were built, and\r\nthe siege operations around Boston and Yorktown were carried on.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of the war, in 1794, a Corps of \"Artillerists and\r\nEngineers\" was organized. This corps was stationed at West Point, and\r\nbecame the nucleus of the United States Military Academy. In 1802, by\r\noperation of the law reorganizing the army, this corps was divided, as\r\nthe names would indicate, into an Artillery Corps and Corps of\r\nEngineers. The Corps of Engineers consisted of one major, two\r\ncaptains, four lieutenants, and ten cadets. The Artillery Corps was\r\nagain divided into the Ordnance Corps and several regiments of\r\nartillery, now five in number, while the duties of the Corps of\r\nEngineers were divided between the Engineer Corps and a Corps of\r\nTopographical Engineers, organized at a later date; but on the\r\nbreaking out of the late rebellion it was deemed best to unite the two\r\ncorps, and they have so remained until the present time. The Corps of\r\nEngineers now consists of 118 officers of various grades, from second\r\nlieutenant to brigadier general, of which last grade there is only one\r\nofficer, the chief of the corps, and it requires something more than\r\nan average official lifetime for the aforesaid lieutenant to attain\r\nthat rank. Hardly one in ten of them ever reach it. Daniel Webster's\r\nremark to the young lawyer, that \"there is always room at the top,\"\r\nwill not apply to the Corps of Engineers. The officers are all\r\ngraduates of the Military Academy, which institution continued as a\r\npart of the Corps of Engineers until 1866. The vacancies in the corps\r\nare filled by the assignment to it of from two to six graduates each\r\nyear, and there is attached to the corps a battalion of four companies\r\nof enlisted men, formerly called Sappers and Miners, but now known as\r\nthe Battalion of Engineers.\r\n\r\nWe now come naturally to the duties of our military engineer, and here\r\nI may remark that these duties are so varied and so numerous that a\r\ndetailed recital of them would suggest Goldsmith's \"Deserted Village:\"\r\n\r\n      ... \"And still the wonder grew\r\n      That one small head could carry all he _ought to know_\"\r\n\r\n[Never lose sight of fact for the sake of rhyme.]\r\n\r\nIn general terms, his duties consist of:\r\n\r\n    1. Military surveys and explorations.\r\n\r\n    2. Boundary surveys.\r\n\r\n    3. Geodetic and hydrographic survey of the great lakes.\r\n\r\n    4. Building fortifications--both permanent works and temporary\r\n    or field works.\r\n\r\n    5. Constructing military roads.\r\n\r\n    6. Pontoniering or building military bridges, both with the\r\n    regular bridge trains and with improved materials.\r\n\r\n    7. The planning and directing of siege operations, either\r\n    offensive or defensive; sapping, mining, etc.\r\n\r\n    8. Providing, testing and planting torpedoes for harbor\r\n    defense when operating from shore stations.\r\n\r\n    9. Staff duty with general officers.\r\n\r\n    10. Improving rivers and harbors.\r\n\r\n    11. The building and repairing of lighthouses.\r\n\r\n    12. Various special duties as commissioner of District of\r\n    Columbia, superintendent military academy, commandant engineer\r\n    school, instructors at both of these schools, attaches to\r\n    several foreign legations, for the collection of military\r\n    information, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, exceed the proper limits of a single lecture to\r\ngo into the details of these many duties, but we may take only a\r\npassing glance at most of them, and give more special attention to a\r\nfew that may involve some points of interest. Perhaps the most\r\ninteresting branch of the subject would be that of permanent\r\nfortifications, or what amounts to almost the same thing in this\r\ncountry, sea coast defenses. And here our trouble begins, for, while\r\ncivil engineers have constant experience to guide them, their roads,\r\nbridges, and other structures being in constant use, the military\r\nengineer has only now and then, at long intervals, a war or a siege of\r\nsufficient extent to furnish data upon which he can safely plan or\r\nbuild his structures. Imagine a civil engineer designing a bridge,\r\nroad, or a dam to meet some possible future demand, without having\r\nseen such a structure used for twenty years or more, and you can form\r\nsome estimate of the delightful uncertainties that surround the\r\nmilitary engineer when called upon to design a modern fort. The\r\nproving ground shows him that radical improvements are necessary, but\r\nactual service conditions are almost entirely wanting, and such as we\r\nhave contradict many of the proving ground theories. Thus we have the\r\nrecords of shot going through 25 inches of iron or 25 feet of concrete\r\non the proving ground; but such actual service tests as the\r\nbombardment of Fort Sumter, Fort Fisher, and the forts at Alexandria\r\ncontradict this entirely, and indicate that, except for the moral\r\neffect, our old forts, with modern guns in them and some additional\r\nstrengthening at their weaker points, would answer all purposes so far\r\nas bombardment from fleets is concerned. This is not saying that the\r\nforts are good enough in their present condition, but simply that they\r\ncan readily be made far superior in strength, both offensive and\r\ndefensive, to any fleet that could possibly be provided at anything\r\nlike the same expense, or in fact at any expense that would be\r\njustified by the condition of our treasury, either past, present, or\r\nprobable future. It might be added that a still more serious\r\ndifficulty in the way of the military engineer, so far as practice and\r\nits consequent experiences are concerned, is that for many years past,\r\nuntil quite recently, there have been no funds either for experiments\r\nor actual work on fortifications, so that very little has been done on\r\nthem during the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nWithout going into the question of the necessity for sea coast\r\ndefenses, we may assume that an enemy is likely to come into one of\r\nour harbors and that it is desirable to keep him out. What provisions\r\nmust be made to accomplish this, i.e., to secure the safety of the\r\nharbors and the millions of dollars' worth of destructible property\r\nconcentrated at the great trade centers that are usually located upon\r\nthose harbors? We must first take a look at the enemy and see what he\r\nis like before we can decide what will be needed to repel his attack.\r\nFor this purpose we need not draw on the imagination, but we may\r\nsimply examine some of the more recent armadas sent to bombard\r\nseaports. For example, the fleet sent by Great Britain to bombard the\r\nEgyptian city of Alexandria, in 1882. This fleet consisted of eight\r\nheavy ironclad ships of from 5,000 to 11,000 tons displacement and\r\nfive or six smaller vessels; and the armament of this squadron\r\nnumbered more than one hundred guns of all calibers, from the sixteen\r\ninch rifle down to the seven inch rifle, besides several smaller guns.\r\nBut this fleet represented only a small fraction of England's naval\r\npower. During some recent evolutions she turned out thirty-six heavy\r\nironclads and forty smaller vessels and torpedo boats. The crews of\r\nthese vessels numbered nearly 19,000 officers and men, or about three\r\ntimes the entire number in our navy. Such a fleet, or, more likely, a\r\nmuch larger one, might appear at the entrance say of New York harbor\r\nwithin ten days after a declaration of war, and demand whatever the\r\nnation to which it belonged might choose, with the alternative of\r\nbombardment.\r\n\r\nThe problem of protecting our people and property from such attacks is\r\nnot a new one, and, in fact, most of the conditions of this problem\r\nremain the same as they were fifty years ago, the differences being in\r\ndegree rather than in kind. The most natural thought would be to meet\r\nsuch a fleet by another fleet, but the folly of such a course will\r\nbecome apparent from a moment's consideration. The difficulties would\r\nbe:\r\n\r\n1st. Our fleet must be decidedly stronger than that of the enemy, or\r\nwe simply fight a duel with an equal chance of success or failure.\r\n\r\n2d. In such a duel the enemy would risk nothing but the loss of his\r\nfleet, and even a portion of that would be likely to escape, but we\r\nwould not only risk a similar loss, but we would also lose the city or\r\nsubject it to the payment of a heavy contribution to the enemy.\r\n\r\n3d. Unless we have a fleet for every harbor, it would be impossible to\r\ndepend upon this kind of defense, as the enemy would select whichever\r\nharbor he found least prepared to receive him. It would be of vital\r\nimportance that we defend every harbor of importance, as a neglect to\r\ndo so would be like locking some of our doors and leaving the others\r\nopen to the burglars.\r\n\r\n4th. It might be thought that we could send our fleet to intercept the\r\nenemy or blockade him in his own ports, but this has been found\r\nimpracticable. Large fleets can readily escape from blockaded harbors,\r\nor elude each other on the high seas, and any such scheme implies that\r\nwe are much stronger on the ocean than the enemy, which is very far\r\nfrom the case. To build a navy that would overmatch that of Great\r\nBritain alone would not only cost untold millions, but it would\r\nrequire many years for its accomplishment; and even if this were done,\r\nthere would be nothing unusual in an alliance of two or more powerful\r\nnations, which would leave us again in the minority. _Fleets, then,\r\ncannot be relied on for permanent defense_.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may be said that we have millions of the bravest soldiers in\r\nthe world who could be assembled and placed under arms at a few days'\r\nnotice. This kind of defense would also prove a delusion, for a\r\nhundred acres of soldiers armed with rifles and field artillery would\r\nbe powerless to drive away even the smallest ironclad or stop a single\r\nprojectile from one. In fact, neither of these plans, nor both\r\ntogether, would be much more effective than the windmills and\r\nproclamations which Irving humorously describes as the means adopted\r\nby the early Dutch governors of New York to defend that city against\r\nthe Swedes and Yankees.\r\n\r\nHaving considered some of the means of defense that will _not_ answer\r\nthe purpose, we may inquire what means _will be_ effective. And here\r\nit should be noted that our defenses should be so effective as not\r\nonly to be reasonably safe, but to be so recognized by all nations,\r\nand thus discourage, if not actually prevent, an attack upon our\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we must have heavy guns in such numbers and of\r\nsuch sizes as to overmatch those of any fleet likely to attack us.\r\nThese guns must be securely mounted, so as to be worked with facility\r\nand accuracy, and they must be protected from the enemy's projectiles\r\nat least as securely as his guns are from ours. Merely placing\r\nourselves on equal terms with the enemy, as in case of a duel or an\r\nancient knight's tournament, will not answer, first, because such a\r\nstate of things would invite rather than discourage attack, and\r\nsecondly, because the enemy would have vastly more to gain by success\r\nand vastly less to lose by failure than we would. This can be\r\naccomplished much easier than is generally supposed, either by earthen\r\nparapets of sufficient thickness or by iron turrets or casements. It\r\nis evident that the weight of metal used in these structures may be\r\nvastly greater than could be carried on shipboard. Great weight of\r\nmetal is no objection on land, but, aside from its cost, is a positive\r\nadvantage. This is evident when we consider the enormous quantity of\r\nenergy stored in the larger projectiles moving at high velocities. For\r\nexample, we often hear of the sixteen inch rifle whose projectile\r\nweighs about one ton, and this enormous mass projected at a velocity\r\nof 2,000 feet per second would have a kinetic energy of 60,000 foot\r\ntons, or it would strike a blow equal to that of ten locomotives of 50\r\ntons each running at 60 miles an hour and striking a solid wall. Any\r\nstructure designed to resist such ponderous blows must, therefore,\r\nhave enormous weight, or it will be overturned or driven bodily from\r\nits foundations. If the armor itself is not thick enough to give the\r\nrequired weight as well as resistance to penetration, the additional\r\nstability must be supplied by re-enforcing it with heavy masses of\r\nmetal or masonry. It is evident, therefore, that _quality_ of metal is\r\nless important than _quantity_, and that so long as it is sufficiently\r\ntough to resist fracture, a soft, cheap metal, like wrought iron or\r\nlow steel, is better adapted for permanent works than any of the fancy\r\nkinds of armor that have been tested for naval purposes. As an\r\nillustration of this, we may compare compound or steel-faced armor\r\nwith wrought iron as follows: The best of the former offers only about\r\none-third greater resistance to penetration than the latter, or 12\r\ninches of compound armor may equal 16 inches of wrought iron, but the\r\ncost per ton is nearly double; so that by using wrought iron we may\r\nhave double the thickness, or 24 inches, which would give more than\r\ndouble the resistance to penetration, in addition to giving double the\r\nstability against overturning or being driven bodily out of place. But\r\nour guns may be reasonably well protected by earthen parapets without\r\nany expensive armor by so mounting them that when fired they will\r\nrecoil downward or to one side, so as to come below the parapet for\r\nloading. This method of mounting is called the disappearing principle,\r\nand has been suggested by many engineers, some of whose designs date\r\nback more than one hundred years. We may also mount our guns in deep\r\npits, where they will be covered from the enemy's guns, and fire them\r\nat high elevation, so that the shell will fall from a great height and\r\npenetrate the decks of the enemy's ships. This is known as mortar\r\nfiring, but the modern ordnance used for this purpose is more of a\r\nhowitzer than a mortar, being simply short rifled pieces arranged for\r\nbreech loading. All our batteries should, of course, be as far from\r\nthe city or other object to be protected as possible, to prevent the\r\nenemy from firing over and beyond the batteries into the city.\r\n\r\nBut, with all these precautions, the enemy might put on all steam and\r\nrun by us either at night or in a dense fog, and we must have some\r\nmeans of holding him under the fire of our guns until his ships can be\r\ndisabled or driven away. This object is sought to be accomplished by\r\nthe use of torpedoes anchored in the channels and under the fire of\r\nour guns, so that they cannot be removed by the enemy. These torpedoes\r\nare generally exploded by electricity from batteries located in\r\ncasements on shore, these casements being connected with the torpedoes\r\nby submarine cables. It is easy to see how the torpedo may be so\r\narranged that when struck by a ship the electric current will be\r\nclosed, and, if the battery on shore is connected at the same instant,\r\nan explosion will take place; on the other hand, if the battery on\r\nshore is disconnected a friendly ship may pass in safety over the\r\ntorpedoes. Many ingenious contrivances have also been devised by which\r\nthe torpedo may be made to signal back to the shore station either\r\nthat it has been struck or that it is in good order for service, in\r\ncase the enemy should undertake to run over it. One simple plan for\r\nthis is to have a small telephone in the torpedo with some loose\r\nbuckshot on the diaphragm, which is placed in a horizontal position,\r\nand will be slightly tilted as the torpedo is moved about by the\r\nwaves. By connecting the shore end of the cable with a telephone\r\nreceiver, the rolling of the shot may be distinctly heard if the\r\ntorpedo is floating properly, but if sunk at its moorings, or if the\r\ncable is broken, no sound will be heard.\r\n\r\nThe use of torpedoes involves the use of both electricity and high\r\nexplosives, and a careful study based upon actual experiments has been\r\ncarried on for many years, by the engineers and naval officers in all\r\ncivilized countries. Some of these experiments have supplied\r\ninteresting and useful data, for the use of the agents in question,\r\nfor various industrial purposes.\r\n\r\nAnother form of torpedo is that known as the locomotive torpedo, of\r\nwhich there are several kinds; some are propelled by liquid carbonic\r\nacid, which is carried in a strong tank and acts through a compact\r\nengine in driving the propeller. One of these is steered by\r\nelectricity from the shore, and is known as the Lay-Haight torpedo,\r\nand can run twenty-five miles per hour. The Whitehead torpedo is also\r\npropelled by liquid carbonic acid, but is not steered from shore. Its\r\ndepth is regulated by an automatic device actuated by the pressure of\r\nthe water. The Howell torpedo is driven by a heavy fly wheel which is\r\nset in rapid rotation just before the torpedo is launched. It has but\r\na short range and is intended for launching from ships. Another\r\ntorpedo is propelled and steered from shore by rapidly pulling out of\r\nit two fine steel wires which, in unwinding, drive the twin screw\r\npropellers. This is the Brennan torpedo. The Sims-Edison torpedo is\r\nboth propelled and steered by electricity from the shore, transmitted\r\nto a motor and steering relay in the torpedo by an insulated cable.\r\nThis cable has two cores and is paid out by the torpedo as it travels\r\nthrough the water just as a spider pays out its web. The cable is\r\nabout half an inch in diameter and two miles long, and the torpedo can\r\nbe driven at about eighteen miles per hour with a current of thirty\r\namperes and 1,800 volts pressure.\r\n\r\nStill another auxiliary weapon of defense is the dynamite gun, or\r\nrather, a pneumatic gun, that throws long projectiles carrying from\r\n250 to 450 pounds of dynamite, to a distance of about two miles. The\r\nshells are arranged to explode soon after striking the water, by an\r\ningenious battery that ignites the fuse as soon as the salt water\r\nenters it. The gun, which is known as the Zalinski gun, is some sixty\r\nfeet long and fifteen inches in caliber, the compressed air being\r\nsuddenly admitted to it from the reservoirs at any desired pressure by\r\na special form of valve that regulates the range. These guns are to be\r\nmounted in deep pits and fired at somewhat higher elevations than\r\nordinary guns, but it has great accuracy within reasonable limits of\r\nrange.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD FORTIFICATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn field fortification an enormous quantity of work was done during\r\nour last war. Washington, Richmond, Nashville, Petersburg, Norfolk,\r\nNew Berne, Plymouth, Vicksburg, and many other cities were elaborately\r\nfortified by field works which involved the handling of vast\r\nquantities of earth, and, where the opposing lines were near together,\r\nditches, abbatis, ground torpedoes, and wire entanglements were freely\r\nused. In some cases the same ground was fortified in succession by\r\nboth armies, so that the total amount of work expended, in this way,\r\nwould have built several hundred miles of railway. Around Richmond and\r\nPetersburg alone the development of field works was far greater than\r\nWellington's celebrated lines at Torres Vedras. In all future wars,\r\nwhen large armies are opposed to each other, it is probable that field\r\nworks will play even a more important part than in the past. The great\r\nadvantage of such works, since the introduction of the deadly breech\r\nloading rifles and machine guns, was shown at Plevna, where the\r\nRussians were almost annihilated in attempting to capture the Turkish\r\nintrenchments.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIEGES.\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed to go into historical or other details of this\r\nbranch of the subject, but to give in a condensed form some account of\r\nsiege operations. According to the text books, the first thing to be\r\ndone, if possible, in case of a regular siege, is to \"invest\" the\r\nfortress. This is done by surrounding it as quickly as possible with a\r\ncontinuous line of troops, who speedily intrench themselves and mount\r\nguns bearing outward on all lines of approach to the fortress, to\r\nprevent the enemy from sending in supplies or re-enforcements. As this\r\nline must be at considerable distance from the fort, it is usually\r\nquite long, and so is its name, for it is called the line of\r\n\"Circumvallation.\" Inside of this line is then established a similar\r\nline facing toward the fort, to prevent sorties by the garrison. This\r\nline is called the line of \"Countervallation,\" and should be as close\r\nto the fort as the range of its guns and the nature of the ground will\r\npermit. From this line the troops rush forward at night and open the\r\ntrenches, beginning with what is called the first parallel, which\r\nshould be so laid out as to envelop those parts of the fort which are\r\nto be made the special objects of attack. From this first parallel a\r\nnumber of zigzag trenches are started toward the fort and at proper\r\nintervals other parallels, batteries, and magazines are built; this\r\nmethod of approach being continued until the besieged fort is reached,\r\nor until such batteries can be brought to bear upon it as to breech\r\nthe walls and allow the attacking troops to make an assault.\r\n\r\nDuring these operations of course many precautions must be observed,\r\nboth by the attacking and defending force, to annoy each other and to\r\nprevent surprise, and the work is mostly carried on under cover of the\r\nearth thrown from the trenches. These operations were supposed to\r\noccupy, under normal conditions, about forty-one days, or rather\r\nnights, as most of the work is done after dark, at the end of which\r\ntime the fort should be reduced to such a condition that its\r\ncommander, having exhausted all means of defense, would be justified\r\nin considering terms of surrender.\r\n\r\nThe _Theoretical Journal_ of the siege prescribes just what is to be\r\ndone each day by both attack and defense up to the final catastrophe,\r\nand this somewhat discouraging outlook for the defenders was forcibly\r\nillustrated by the late Captain Derby, better known by the reading\r\npublic as \"John Phoenix,\" who, when a cadet, was called upon by\r\nProfessor Mahan to explain how he would defend a fort, mounting a\r\ncertain number of guns and garrisoned by a certain number of men, if\r\nbesieged by an army of another assumed strength in men and guns,\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n\"I would immediately evacuate the fort and then besiege it and capture\r\nit again in forty-one days.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the fallacy of this reasoning was in the fact that the\r\nbesieging army is generally supposed to be four or five times as large\r\nas the garrison of the fort; the primary object of forts being to\r\nenable a small force to hold a position, at least for a time, against\r\na much larger force of the enemy.\r\n\r\nSieges have changed with the development of engines of war, from the\r\nrude and muscular efforts of personal prowess like that described in\r\nIvanhoe, where the Black Knight cuts his way through the barriers with\r\nhis battle axe, to such sieges as those at Vicksburg, Petersburg, and\r\nPlevna, where the individual counted for very little, and the results\r\ndepended upon the combined efforts of large numbers of men and\r\nsystematic siege operations. It should also be noticed that modern\r\nsieges are not necessarily hampered by the rules laid down in text\r\nbooks, but vary from them according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor example, many sieges have been carried to successful issues\r\nwithout completely investing or surrounding the fortress. This was the\r\ncase at Petersburg, where General Lee was entirely free to move out,\r\nor receive supplies and re-enforcements up to the very last stages of\r\nthe siege. In other cases, as at Fort Pulaski, Sumter, and Macon, the\r\nbreeching batteries were established at very much greater distances\r\nthan ever before attempted, and the preliminary siege operations were\r\nvery much abbreviated and some of them omitted altogether. This is not\r\nan argument against having well defined rules and principles, but it\r\nshows that the engineer must be prepared to cut loose from old rules\r\nand customs whenever the changed state of circumstances requires\r\ndifferent treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILITARY BRIDGES.\r\n\r\nIn the movement of armies, especially on long marches in the enemy's\r\ncountry, one of the greatest difficulties to be overcome is the\r\ncrossing of streams, and this is usually done by means of portable\r\nbridges. These may be built of light trestles with adjustable legs to\r\nsuit the different depths, or of wooden or canvas boats supporting a\r\nlight roadway wide enough for a single line of ordinary wagons or\r\nartillery carriages. The materials for these bridges, which are known\r\nas Ponton Bridges, are loaded upon wagons and accompany the army on\r\nits marches, and when required for use the bridge is rapidly put\r\ntogether, piece by piece, in accordance with fixed rules, which\r\nconstitute, in fact, a regular drill. The wooden boats are quite heavy\r\nand are used for heavy traffic, but for light work, as, for example,\r\nto accompany the rapid movements of the cavalry, boats made of heavy\r\ncanvas, stretched upon light wooden frames, that are put together on\r\nthe spot, are used.\r\n\r\nDuring Gen. Sherman's memorable Georgia campaign and march to the sea,\r\nover three miles of Ponton bridges were built in crossing the numerous\r\nstreams met with, and nearly two miles of trestle bridges. In Gen.\r\nGrant's Wilderness campaign the engineers built not less than\r\nthirty-eight bridges between the Rappahannock and the James Rivers,\r\nthese bridges aggregating over 6,600 feet in length. Under favorable\r\ncircumstances such bridges can be built at the rate of 200 to 300 feet\r\nper hour, and they can be taken up at a still more rapid rate. When\r\nthere is no bridge train at hand the engineer is obliged to use such\r\nimprovised materials as he can get; buildings are torn down to get\r\nplank and trees are cut to make the frame. Sometimes single stringers\r\nwill answer, but if a greater length of bridge is required it may be\r\nsupported on piles or trestles, or in deep water on rafts of logs or\r\ncasks. But the heavy traffic of armies, operating at some distance\r\nfrom their bases, must be transported by rail, and the building of\r\nrailway bridges or rebuilding those destroyed by the enemy is an\r\nimportant duty of the engineer. On the Potomac Creek, in Virginia, a\r\ntrestle bridge 80 feet high and 400 feet long was built in nine\r\nworking days, from timber out of the neighborhood. Another bridge\r\nacross the Etowah River, in Georgia, was built in Gen. Sherman's\r\ncampaign, and a similar bridge was also built over the Chattahoochee.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEYS AND EXPLORATIONS.\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century before the building of the great Pacific\r\nrailways, engineer officers were engaged in making surveys and\r\nexplorations in the great unknown country west of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, and the final map of that country was literally covered with a\r\nnetwork of trails made by them. Several of these officers lost their\r\nlives in such expeditions, while others lived to become more famous as\r\ncommanders during the great rebellion. Generals Kearney, J.E.\r\nJohnston, Pope, Warren, Fremont and Parke, and Colonels Long, Bache,\r\nEmory, Whipple, Woodruff and Simpson, Captains Warner, Stansbury,\r\nGunnison and many other officers, generally in their younger days,\r\ncontributed their quota to the geographical knowledge of the country,\r\nand made possible the wonderful network of railways guarded by\r\nmilitary posts that has followed their footsteps. Their reports fill\r\ntwelve large quarto volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY AND LAKE SURVEYS.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical location of the boundaries of the several States and\r\nTerritories, as well as of the United States, is a duty frequently\r\nrequired of the engineer officer, and such a survey between this\r\ncountry and Mexico is now in progress. The entire line of the 49th\r\nparallel of latitude from the Lake of the Woods to the Pacific Ocean,\r\nwhich forms our northern boundary, was located a few years ago by a\r\njoint commission of English and United States engineers, and monuments\r\nwere established at short intervals over its entire length.\r\n\r\nA careful geodetic and hydrographic survey of the Great Northern\r\nLakes, including every harbor upon them and the rivers connecting\r\nthem, was carried on for many years and was finally completed some ten\r\nyears ago. Maps and charts of these surveys are published from time to\r\ntime for use of pilots navigating these waters.\r\n\r\nNot only are the duties of the military engineer similar in many\r\nrespects to those of the civil engineer, but there are many instances\r\nin which the duties of one branch of the profession have been\r\nperformed by members of the other branch, quite as efficiently as\r\nthough they had been performed by engineers specially educated for the\r\npurpose. During the late civil war there were many illustrations of\r\nthis, all showing that an ingenious engineer can readily adapt himself\r\nto circumstances entirely different from those to which he has been\r\naccustomed. A very good example of this occurred in the Red River\r\nexpedition of General Banks and Admiral Porter. In that memorable but\r\ndisastrous campaign an army accompanied by a fleet of transports and\r\nlight draught gunboats, sometimes called \"tin clads\" because some\r\nparts of them were covered with boiler plate to stop the bullets of\r\nthe enemy, ascended the Red River in Louisiana; but the advance having\r\nbeen checked and a retreat commenced, it was found that the river had\r\nfallen to such a low state that the fleet was caught above the rapids\r\nnear Alexandria, and it would in all probability have been a complete\r\nloss had it not been for the timely application of engineering skill\r\nby Lieut. Col. Joseph Bailey, a civil engineer from Wisconsin, who\r\nbuilt a temporary dam across the river below the rapids and floated\r\nout the entire fleet. This dam was over 750 feet long and in\r\nconnection with some auxiliary dams raised the water level some 6½\r\nfeet. It was built under many difficulties, but by the skill and\r\nability of the engineer and the co-operation of the troops it was\r\ncompleted in ten days. Another case was at the siege of Petersburg,\r\nVa., where Lieut. Col. Pleasants, a Pennsylvania coal miner, ran a\r\ngallery from our lines, under the rebel battery, some 500 feet\r\ndistant, and blew it entirely out of existence. The mine contained\r\nfour tons of powder and produced a crater 200 feet by 50 feet and 25\r\nfeet deep, and was completed in one month. The sequel to this was to\r\nbe an attack on the enemy's line through the gap made by the\r\nexplosion, and such an attack properly followed up would doubtless\r\nhave had a marked effect in shortening the duration of the war, but\r\nthis attack was so badly managed that it utterly failed and caused a\r\nsevere loss to our own army. The mine itself, however, was a great\r\nsuccess and produced a decided moral effect on both sides which lasted\r\nuntil the end of the war.\r\n\r\nIt may be out of place to digress a moment to illustrate the moral\r\neffect of such a convulsion. Several weeks after this great mine\r\nexplosion, the 18th Army Corps, to which I then belonged, was holding\r\na line of works recently captured from the rebels, about six miles\r\nfrom Richmond, when one night the colonel commanding Fort Harrison, a\r\nlarge field work forming a part of this line, came down to\r\nheadquarters and reported that some old Pennsylvania coal miners in\r\nhis command had heard mining going on under the fort. As the nearest\r\npart of the enemy's line was some 400 yards from the fort, I was quite\r\ncertain that they could not have run a gallery that distance in the\r\ntime that had elapsed since we occupied the work, but there was of\r\ncourse the possibility that the mine had been partly built beforehand\r\nso as to be ready in just such a case as had arisen, viz., the capture\r\nof the fort by our troops. I therefore went with the colonel up to the\r\nfort to listen for the mining operations, and got the men who claimed\r\nto have heard the subterranean noises, down in the bottom of the ditch\r\nof the fort, which was ten feet deep, and at the angles formed a\r\nfairly good listening gallery, but nothing unusual could be heard. I\r\ntherefore made arrangements to sink a line of pits in the bottom of\r\nthe ditch, something like ordinary wells; the bottoms of these pits to\r\nbe finally connected by a horizontal gallery which would envelop the\r\nfort and enable us to hear the enemy and blow him up, before he could\r\nget under the fort. Although the commanding officer of that fort was\r\nas brave an officer as the war developed, he would not keep his men in\r\nthe fort after dark, but withdrew them quietly to the flanks of the\r\nwork, where they not only would be safe from an explosion, but would\r\nbe ready to fall upon the enemy in case he should blow up the fort and\r\nrush in to capture the line, as our troops had attempted to do at\r\nPetersburg. No explosion took place, however, and after our\r\ncountermining work was completed, the garrison became reassured and\r\nremained in the fort at night as well as in day time. A few months\r\nlater, when the enemy was driven from his lines, I went through his\r\nworks to see whether any mining had been attempted, and found that a\r\ngallery leading toward Fort Harrison had been carried quite a\r\ndistance, but was still incomplete, and it is barely possible that the\r\nold miners were right, after all, in thinking that they could hear the\r\nsound of the pick, although the distance was almost too great to make\r\nthis theory very probable.\r\n\r\nStill another illustration of the way in which civil engineers can\r\nmake themselves extremely useful in military operations was the\r\nwonderful system of military railways, or railways operated for\r\nmilitary purposes, that formed complete lines of transportation for\r\nthe armies and their enormous quantities of supplies and munitions,\r\nmore especially those in the West and Southwest. Construction trains\r\nwere organized in the most complete style, and when a piece of track\r\nor a number of bridges were destroyed by the enemy, they would be\r\nrebuilt so rapidly that our trains would hardly seem to be delayed by\r\nit. The trains carried spare rails, ties, and bridges of various\r\nlengths ready to put up, and they also carried the necessary rolling\r\nstock and tools for destroying the roads and bridges of the enemy. So\r\nexpert had this construction corps become that the enemy was ready to\r\nbelieve almost any statement in regard to it. General Sherman tells of\r\nan instance where it was proposed to blow up a tunnel, to check his\r\n\"March to the Sea,\" when one of the men objected, saying it was of no\r\nuse, for Sherman had a duplicate tunnel in his train.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is not a sermon, it may not be out of place to point out\r\na few qualifications common to all engineers, for they all deal more\r\nor less with the same materials and forces and employ similar methods\r\nof investigation and construction. Wood, iron, steel, copper and stone\r\nand their compounds are the materials of the civil, mining, mechanical\r\nand electrical, as well as of the military engineers. They all deal\r\nwith the forces of gravitation, cohesion, inertia and chemical\r\naffinity. They all require skill, intelligence, industry, confidence,\r\naccuracy, thoroughness, ingenuity and, beyond all, sound judgment.\r\nWanting in any one of these qualifications, an engineer is more or\r\nless disqualified for important work. It is said that a distinguished\r\nengineer was always afraid to cross his own bridges, although built in\r\nthe most thorough and approved manner. He was deficient in confidence.\r\nAnother engineer distinguished for his mathematical attainments built\r\na bridge which promptly collapsed at the first opportunity. On\r\noverhauling his computations he ejaculated somewhat forcibly, \"That\r\nconfounded minus sign! It should have been plus.\" He was deficient in\r\nsound judgment, or what is sometimes called \"horse sense.\"\r\n\r\nAnother and more common defect in young engineers is a want of\r\nthoroughness. It is generally best to go to the bottom of a question\r\nat first and keep at it until it is thoroughly and fully completed.\r\nConfucius says, \"If thou hast aught to do, first consider, second act,\r\nthird let the soul resume her tranquillity.\" Those who begin a great\r\nmany things and never fully complete them lose a great deal of\r\nvaluable time, but do very little valuable work. The way to avoid this\r\ndifficulty is to be cautious about beginning things, but when once\r\nstarted don't leave it until you are satisfied to leave it for good.\r\nThere is an Arabian saying, \"Never undertake _all_ you can do, for he\r\nwho undertakes _all_ he can do will frequently undertake _more_ than\r\nhe can do.\"\r\n\r\nAnother common error is extravagance. On the plea that \"the best is\r\nalways the cheapest,\" and to be sure of a large factor of safety, or\r\nas the late Mr. Holley called it a \"factor of ignorance,\" without much\r\ntrouble to themselves, some engineers use more or better materials\r\nthan the work requires, and thus greatly increase the cost without any\r\ncorresponding advantage. Almost any engineer can do almost anything in\r\nthe way of engineering if not limited by the cost, but the man who\r\nknows just what materials to use and how to use them so that they will\r\nanswer the purpose as to strength and durability can save his own\r\nsalary to his employer many times over by simply omitting unnecessary\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW MECHANICAL RUBBER GOODS ARE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the manufacture of rubber goods is in no sense a secret\r\nindustry, the majority of buyers and users of such goods have never\r\nstepped inside of a rubber mill, and many have very crude ideas as to\r\nhow the goods are made up. In ordinary garden hose, for instance, the\r\nprocess is as follows: The inner tubing is made of a strip of rubber\r\nfifty feet in length, which is laid on a long zinc-covered table and\r\nits edges drawn together over a hose pole. The cover, which is of what\r\nis called \"friction,\" that is cloth with rubber forced through its\r\nmeshes, comes to the hose maker in strips, cut on the bias, which are\r\nwound around the outside of the tube and adhere tightly to it. The\r\nhose pole is then put in something like a fifty foot lathe, and while\r\nthe pole revolves slowly, it is tightly wrapped with strips of cloth,\r\nin order that it may not get out of shape while undergoing the process\r\nof vulcanizing. When a number of these hose poles have been covered in\r\nthis way they are laid in a pan set on trucks and are then run into a\r\nlong boiler, shut in, and live steam is turned on. When the goods are\r\ncured steam is blown off, the vulcanizer opened and the cloths are\r\nremoved. The hose is then slipped off the pole by forcing air from a\r\ncompressor between the rubber and the hose pole. This, of course, is\r\nwhat is known as hose that has a seam in it.\r\n\r\nFor seamless hose the tube is made in a tubing machine and slipped\r\nupon the hose pole by reversing the process that is used in removing\r\nhose by air compression. In other words, a knot is tied in one end of\r\nthe fifty foot tube and the other end is placed against the hose pole\r\nand being carefully inflated with air it is slipped on without the\r\nleast trouble. For various kinds of hose the processes vary, and there\r\nare machines for winding with wire and intricate processes for the\r\nheavy grades of suction hose, etc. For steam hose, brewers', and acid\r\nhose, special resisting compounds are used, that as a rule are the\r\nsecrets of the various manufacturers. Cotton hose is woven through\r\nmachines expressly designed for that purpose, and afterward has a\r\nhalf-cured rubber tube drawn through it. One end is then securely\r\nstopped up and the other end forced on a cone through which steam is\r\nintroduced to the inside of the hose, forcing the rubber against the\r\ncotton cover, finishing the cure and fixing it firmly in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRUGATED MATTING.\r\n\r\nAfter the mixing of the compound and the calendering, that is the\r\nspreading it in sheets, the great roll of rubber and cloth that is to\r\nbe made into corrugated matting is sent to the pressman. Here it is\r\nhung in a rack and fifteen or twenty feet of it drawn between the\r\nplates of the huge hydraulic steam press. The bottom plate of this\r\npress is grooved its whole length, so that when the upper platen is\r\nlet down the plain sheet of rubber is forced into the grooves and the\r\ncorrugations are formed. While in that position steam is let into the\r\nupper and lower platens and the matting is cured. After it has been in\r\nthere the proper time, cold water is let into the press, it is cooled\r\noff, and the upper platen being raised, it is ready to come out. A\r\nsimple device for loosening the matting from the grooves into which it\r\nhas been forced is a long steel rod, with a handle on one hand like an\r\nauger handle, which, being introduced under the edge and twisted,\r\nallows the air to enter with it and releases it from the mould.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACKING.\r\n\r\nSheet packing is often times made in a press, like corrugated matting.\r\nThe varieties, however, known as gum core have to go through a\r\ndifferent process. Usually a core is squirted through a tube machine\r\nand the outside covering of jute or cotton, or whatever the fabric may\r\nbe, is put on by a braider or is wrapped about it somewhat after the\r\nmanner of the old fashioned cloth-wrapped tubing. The fabric is either\r\ntreated with some heat-resisting mixture or something that is a\r\nlubricant, plumbago and oil being the compound. Other packings are\r\nmade from the ends of belts cut out in a circular form and treated\r\nwith a lubricant. There are scores of styles that make special claims\r\nfor excellences that are made in a variety of ways, but as a rule the\r\ngeneral system as outlined above is followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAR RINGS.\r\n\r\nThe old fashioned way of making jar rings was first to take a large\r\nmandrel and wrap it around with a sheet of compounded rubber until the\r\nthickness of the ring was secured. It was then held in place by a\r\nfurther wrapping of cloth, vulcanized, put in a lathe and cut up into\r\nrings by hand. That manner of procedure, however, was too slow, and it\r\nis to-day done almost wholly by machinery. For example, the rubber is\r\nsquirted out of a mammoth tubing machine in the shape of a huge tube,\r\nthen slipped on a mandrel and vulcanized. It is then put in an\r\nautomatic lathe and revolving swiftly is brought against a sharp\r\nknife blade which cuts ring after ring until the whole is consumed,\r\nwithout any handling or watching.--_India Rubber World_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW ENAMELED LETTERS ARE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of a brief visit by a representative of\r\nthe _Journal of Decorative Art_ to the new factory of the Patent\r\nLetter and Enamel Company, Ltd., situate in the East End of London.\r\n\r\nThe company have recently secured a large freehold plot in the center\r\nof the East End of London, and have built for themselves a most\r\ncommodious and spacious factory, some hundreds of feet in length, all\r\non one floor, and commanded from one end by the manager's office, from\r\nwhence can be seen at a glance the entire premises.\r\n\r\nThe works are divided into two large compartments, and are lighted\r\nfrom the roof, ample provision being made for ventilation, and\r\nattention being given to those sanitary conditions which are, or\r\nshould be, imperative on all well managed establishments.\r\n\r\nWe first explore the stockroom. Here are stored the numerous dies, of\r\nall sizes and shapes, which the company possess, varying in size from\r\nhalf an inch to twelve or sixteen inches. Here, too, is kept the large\r\nstore of thin sheet copper out of which the letters are stamped. Our\r\nreaders are familiar with the form or principle upon which these\r\nletters are made. It is simply a convex surface, the reverse side\r\nbeing concave, and being fixed on to the glass or other material with\r\na white lead preparation. When these letters were first made, the\r\npractice was to cut or stamp them out in flat copper, and then to\r\nround or mould them by a second operation. Recent improvements in the\r\nmachinery, however, have dispensed with this dual process, and the\r\nstamping and moulding is done in the one swift, sharp operation.\r\n\r\nThe process of making an enameled letter has four stages--stamping,\r\nenameling, firing, and filing. There are other and subsequent\r\nprocesses for elaborating, but those named are of the essence of the\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAMPING.\r\n\r\nThe stamping is done by means of presses, and is a very rapid and\r\ncomplete operation.\r\n\r\nThe operator takes a piece of the sheet copper, places it on the\r\npress, the lever descends, there is a sharp crunching, bursting sound,\r\nand in a time shorter than it has taken to describe, the letter is\r\nmade, sharp and perfect in every way.\r\n\r\n\r\nENAMELING.\r\n\r\nThe letters are now taken charge of by a girl, who lays them out on a\r\nwire tray, the hollow side up, and paints them over with a thin\r\nmordant. While they are in this position, and before the mordant\r\ndries, they are taken on the gridiron-like tray to a kind of large\r\nbox, which is full of the powdered enamel, and, holding the tray in\r\nher left hand, the girl takes a fine sieve full of the powder and\r\ndusts it over the letter, all superfluous powder falling through the\r\nopen wirework and into the bin again, so that there is absolutely no\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUSTING THE LETTERS BEFORE FIRING.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRING.\r\n\r\nThe letters are now taken and placed carefully on thin iron disks or\r\nplates on the bench, where they remain until they are fired. It will\r\nbe remembered that we said at the outset that the factory was divided\r\ninto two large compartments, and it is into the second of these that\r\nwe now go.\r\n\r\nHere are ranged the series of furnaces which convert the copper and\r\nsuperincumbent enamel into one common body--fuse the one into the\r\nother. An unwary step soon warns us that we are too near the furnace,\r\nunless we want to run the risk of a premature cremation, and in the\r\ninterests of the readers of this journal we step back to a respectful\r\nand proper distance, and watch the operations from afar.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something innately picturesque about all furnaces\r\nand those who work about them. Whether it is the Rembrandt effects\r\nproduced by the strong light and shade, or whether it is that the\r\nnecessary use of the long iron instruments, such as all furnace\r\nworkers employ, compels a certain dignity and grace of poise and\r\naction, we know not; but certain it is that the grace is there in a\r\nmarked degree, and as we watched the men take their long-handled iron\r\ntongs and place in or lift out the plates of hot metal, we could not\r\nfail to be impressed with the charm of the physical action they\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\nThe disk containing the enameled letters is taken at the end of a long\r\niron handle and carefully placed in a dome-shaped muffle. These\r\nmuffles are all heated from the outside; that is, the fire is all\r\nround the chamber, but not in it, the fumes of the sulphur being\r\ndestructive of the enamel if they are allowed to come into contact\r\nwith it. So intense is the heat, however, that a muffle lasts only\r\nabout nine days, and at the end of that time has to be renewed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRING THE LETTERS]\r\n\r\nAfter the enamel is fused on to the copper, the disk is taken out and\r\nplaced on a side slab, where it is allowed to cool.\r\n\r\nThis process is repeated on the front side of the letter, when all\r\nthat remains to complete it is\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FILING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILING THE LETTERS AFTER ENAMELING.]\r\n\r\nThis is done by girls, who, with very fine files, rub off the edges\r\nand any protuberances which may be there. Every letter is subject to\r\nthis operation, and all are turned out smooth and well finished.\r\n\r\nSometimes the letters are colored or further defined by the addition\r\nof a line, but the essentials are as we have already described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIXING THE ENAMEL]\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUSHING OUT.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, one or two other operations of interest which we\r\nmay notice. The company do not confine their exertions to the making\r\nof letters, various collateral developments having taken place which\r\nfill an important part in this scheme of work.\r\n\r\nOf these, small tablets, containing advertisements or notices, such as\r\nwe see in railway carriages, \"Push after raising window,\" or \"Close\r\nthis door after you,\" or some legend pertaining to Brown's Soap or\r\nRobinson's Washing Powder. These are done by different processes, the\r\ntransfer process, as used in the potteries, being employed, but the\r\none most largely used is that of \"brushing out,\" which is done by\r\nplates.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that the tablet shows white letters on a dark ground,\r\nthe _modus operandi_ is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe tablet has been enameled, as already described, and is white. The\r\noperator now takes a dark enamel and spreads it evenly over the entire\r\nsurface of the tablet. He, or she, now takes a stencil plate, of\r\ntinfoil, out of which the ground is cut, leaving the letter in the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nThis is carefully placed over the tablet and held tight with the left\r\nhand, while with the right hand he holds a fine brush, which he uses\r\nwith a quick, sharp movement over the surface. This action readily\r\nremoves the unfired color from the hard, glassy surface underneath,\r\nand leaves a white letter. This is fired, and is then complete.\r\n\r\nSometimes two and, it may be, three plates are necessary to complete\r\nthe brushing out, as ties must be left, as in the case of ordinary\r\nstencils, and these have to be brushed out with additional plates. Two\r\nor three colors may be introduced by this process, but each separate\r\ncolor means separate firing. If the letters are dark on a light\r\nground, the process is exactly the same, the stencil only being\r\nmodified. In addition to the letters and tablets thus described, the\r\ncompany also undertake the production of large enameled signs, and to\r\ncope with the rapid expansion of this department of their work they\r\nare erecting special furnaces, to enable them to deal with any demand\r\nlikely to be made upon them. The call for things permanent and\r\nwashable in the way of advertising is on the increase, and the\r\nenameled plates made by the company is one of the most successful ways\r\nof meeting the demand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE SMITH A MIGHTY MAN IS HE.\"]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNING BRICK WITH CRUDE OIL FUEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time there is not the least reason why either wood,\r\ncoal, or any other solid fuel should be used for the burning of brick.\r\nThis style of burning brick belongs to a past age. The art of\r\nbrickmaking has made tremendous progress during the past quarter of a\r\ncentury. It is no longer the art of the ignorant; brains, capital,\r\nexperience, science, wide and general knowledge, must in these days be\r\nthe property of the successful brick manufacturer. There are some such\r\nprogressive brick manufacturers in Chicago, who use neither coal nor\r\nwood in the drying or burning of their clay products. Crude oil is the\r\nfuel which they employ, and with this fuel they obtain cheaper and\r\nbetter brick than do manufacturers who employ solid fuel. Some of\r\nthese manufacturers have expressed themselves as preferring to quit\r\nthe brick business rather than return to the use of wood or coal as\r\nfuel in brick burning.\r\n\r\nThis shows plainly that progress in our art, when it does come, comes\r\nto remain. It is true that crude oil for brick-burning purposes is not\r\neverywhere obtainable. But there is a fuel which is even better than\r\ncrude oil, namely, fuel gas, and which can be produced and employed on\r\nany brick yard at a saving of seventy-five per cent. over coal or\r\nother solid fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Rose process for making fuel gas gives a water gas enriched by\r\npetroleum. Roughly, about half the cost of this gas as made at\r\nBellefonte, Pa., was for oil. The gas cost 6.68c. per 1,000 cu. ft.,\r\nwith oil at 2¼c. a gallon. At double this price the gas would cost but\r\n10c., and show that in practice, foot for foot, it equals natural gas.\r\n\r\nFuel gas means a larger investment of capital than does any of the\r\nother modes of brick burning, and is, therefore, not within the reach\r\nof the entire trade. The cost of appliances for burning brick with\r\ncrude oil is not very large, and as all grate bars, iron frames, and\r\ndoors can be dispensed with in the use of crude oil fuel, the cost of\r\nan oil-burning equipment is but little in excess of an equipment of\r\ngrates, etc., for coal-burning kilns.\r\n\r\nAt works using small amounts of fuel, especially if cost of fuel bears\r\nbut a small proportion to total cost of the manufactured product, oil\r\nwill be in the future very largely used. It is clean, as compared with\r\ncoal, can be easily handled, and when carefully used in small\r\nquantities, is safe. There are several methods of burning oil that are\r\nwell adapted to the use of brick manufacturers and other fuel\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Railroad made some very thorough experiments on the\r\nuse of petroleum in their locomotives, and while the results obtained\r\nare reported to have been satisfactory, it was the opinion of those\r\nhaving the experiments in charge that the demand for the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad alone, were it to change its locomotives from coal to oil,\r\nwould consume all the surplus and send up the price of oil to a figure\r\nthat would compel a return to coal.\r\n\r\nIt is true that production has enormously increased in the last three\r\nyears, and the promise for the near future is that a high rate will be\r\nmaintained. It is further true that the production of Russia has\r\nincreased enormously, and will probably be larger this year than ever\r\nbefore. This Russian oil must go to markets and supply demands that\r\nhave been met by American oil, and this will still further increase\r\nthe amount of oil available for fuel purposes.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, therefore, that petroleum has a future for fuel\r\nuses. Many brick manufacturers are ready to use it, notwithstanding\r\nthe possibility of an advance in its cost.\r\n\r\nWhile there are some objections to the use of petroleum as a fuel,\r\ngrowing chiefly out of the risk attending its storage and conveyance\r\nto the point of consumption, it is undoubtedly true that the chief\r\nobjection is the fear that with the increased demand that would follow\r\nany extended use for this purpose would come an increase in price that\r\nwould make its continued use too expensive.\r\n\r\nJust four years ago, when the fuel oil industry was first projected,\r\nit was cried down because, as its enemies claimed, there was not\r\nenough oil fuel to be obtained in America to supply the New York City\r\nfactories alone, to say nothing of other territory, and because of the\r\nhigh prices for oil that were sure to follow its substitution for coal\r\nfuel. Since then the industry has experienced a magnificent success,\r\nthe sales exceeding 20,000,000 barrels a year, while the price is\r\nlower than ever.\r\n\r\nA curious impression seems to have gained ground to the effect that\r\nthe Standard Oil Company does not want to sell oil for fuel. It may be\r\nstated authoritatively that the company is not only able but willing\r\nto sell and deliver oil for fuel purposes in any quantity that may be\r\ndesired. It is now delivering oil for fuel purposes in fourteen States\r\nof the Union. For its sales in Chicago and the West and Northwest, the\r\ndelivery is by tank cars from the terminus of the pipe line at South\r\nChicago, to which point it is pumped from Lima, O. The Chicago price\r\nis 1-2/3c. per gallon, or 70c. per barrel of 42 gallons, f.o.b. cars\r\nat Chicago.\r\n\r\nA great many of the brick manufacturers here and throughout the\r\nNorthwest are beginning to use crude petroleum as a substitute for\r\nsoft coal. It is smokeless, for the fine spray of oil which comes from\r\nthe injector consists of such minute drops of the liquid and is so\r\nthoroughly mixed with oxygen that when it burns the combustion is\r\ncomplete, and only steam and carbonic acid gas go out of the top of\r\nthe kiln. Not a speck of soot comes from the kiln or the smokestack or\r\nsoils the whitewashed purity of the boiler room. Oil fuel is\r\nabsolutely clean. It is labor saving, too. No fireman has to keep\r\nshoveling coal, there are no ashes to be dragged out from under the\r\nfurnace grates, and there are no clinkers to clog up the bars. One\r\nman, by turning a valve, may regulate the heat of a kiln containing\r\none million brick.\r\n\r\nNot only is it cleaner than coal and calls for less labor, but it is\r\nactually cheaper as a fuel. A barrel and a half of crude oil is equal\r\nfor furnace fuel to a ton of the best Illinois bituminous coal, and at\r\n70c. a barrel any one can easily calculate the advantages petroleum\r\nhas over its smoky rival. Theoretically, two barrels of oil equal in\r\nheating power one ton of best Pittsburg coal.\r\n\r\nAn examination into the relative cost of the Pittsburg and Chicago\r\ncoal to the oil consumed shows that the price of oil at Pittsburg is\r\n59c. per barrel of 42 gallons, and slack coal can be purchased at from\r\n70c. to 80c. per ton, and the best quality of lump coal at from $1.10\r\nto $1.25 per ton, while the same quality of fuel can be bought in\r\nChicago at about 70c. a barrel, as against coal at from $2 to $3.50\r\nper ton. It would, therefore, look as though there could be no\r\nquestion whatever as to the economy and advantages to be derived from\r\nthe use of oil as a fuel in this vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe weight of oil required is less than half that of average coal to\r\nproduce the same amount of steam.\r\n\r\nA great advantage in using oil as fuel in brick burning is that the\r\nfires are always under the absolute and direct control of the man in\r\ncharge of the burning, who can regulate the volume of flame to the\r\nnicest degree and throw the heat to any part of the arches that he may\r\ndesire.\r\n\r\nFrom present indications, oil will be the fuel adopted generally for\r\ngenerating power and for brick burning in Chicago, as it saves the\r\nboilers, avoids grate bars, saves dirt and cinders, and reduces\r\nrunning expenses, etc.\r\n\r\nMuch skepticism was at first exhibited in Chicago only a few years ago\r\nwhen one of the leading brick manufacturers attempted to burn a kiln\r\nof brick with coal for fuel. Nearly all the brickmakers then in\r\nbusiness put on wise looks and predicted the failure of the experiment\r\nwith coal. But coal proved to be a better and cheaper fuel than wood,\r\nand in five or six years wood was used only for the kindling of the\r\ncoal fires.\r\n\r\nThen came the attempt to burn brick with crude oil, and the experiment\r\nhaving proved a success, coal has been banished from the leading brick\r\nyards in Chicago and vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe Purington-Kimball Brick Co., Adams J. Weckler, Weber & La Bond,\r\nthe May-Purington Brick Co., the Union Brick Co., and the Pullman\r\nBrick Co., all having headquarters in Chicago, as well as the Peerless\r\nBrick Co. and the Pioneer Fireproof Construction Co., both of Ottawa,\r\nIll., are using crude oil fuel for brick burning.\r\n\r\nLima crude oil is used, and it is atomized by means of steam in small\r\nfurnaces extending about two feet from the face of the brick kilns,\r\nand in which furnaces combustion occurs, and the conversion of the oil\r\nand steam into a gaseous fuel is secured. There is little doubt that\r\nthe fuel employed in the future by the successful brick manufacturer\r\nmust be in the gaseous form. Owing to the enormous cost of handling\r\ncoal, wood, and other crude fuel, and of removing the ash resulting\r\nfrom such fuel, it has been demonstrated in practice by the use of\r\ncrude oil that the expense connected with the burning of brick can be\r\nreduced fully 60 per cent. This large saving is made by converting\r\ncrude petroleum into gas and utilizing this fuel, either directly in\r\nthe arches of the kiln or by converting the crude oil into gas in a\r\ngas producer, and drawing this fuel gas from the producer and burning\r\nthe same as required in kilns of suitable construction.\r\n\r\nCrude oil fuel must in the future play an important part in all\r\nbranches of manufacture requiring high, constant heats, and in which\r\nthe cost of wood, coal, and other solid fuels, together with the labor\r\ncost of handling them, forms a considerable part of the cost of\r\nproduction. Where coal is required to be hauled in carts from the\r\nwharves, or from a line of railway to the brick yard, located a mile,\r\nmore or less, from the places where the coal is received, the cost of\r\nhandling, haulage, and waste is an important item. Added to these\r\ncosts, the deterioration of soft coal under atmospheric influences and\r\nthe waste from imperfect combustion and from the particles which fall\r\nfrom the grate bars into the ash pits, all eat a large hole in the\r\nbrickmakers' profit.\r\n\r\nMr. D.V. Purington, of Chicago, Ill., in speaking on this subject,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n    \"I will say that my fuel bill for oil is cheaper than it would\r\n    cost me for coal. There is a very wide difference in the cost\r\n    of unloading, hauling away ashes and cinders, and getting my\r\n    coal around to the kiln, or boilers, or drier, or wherever I\r\n    use it, and I get very much better results by being able to\r\n    put the heat from oil fuel just where I want it.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to secure the best results with any fuel it is not only\r\nnecessary that a cheap fuel should be used, but that it should be\r\nalways obtainable, and that all of it should be burned and turned to\r\ncommercial account in the operations of brick manufacture.\r\n\r\nOwing to the losses which we have previously mentioned, and resulting\r\nfrom the use of coal, this fuel is destined to be superseded by some\r\nform of fuel which will avoid such losses, and which will dispense\r\nwith all of the inconveniences now encountered in the handling of coal\r\nand of the ashes resulting from combustion. Wood is rapidly becoming\r\ntoo scarce and high near the great centers of man's habitation to be\r\nregarded in the present discussion.\r\n\r\nFully two hundred million of brick a year are being burned in the city\r\nof Chicago with crude oil fuel, and a clamp kiln containing one\r\nmillion brick can be burned with crude oil in Chicago at a labor cost\r\nof less than $100, and at a total cost for labor and oil of about 40c.\r\nper thousand brick.\r\n\r\nThere are not, however, many places in the world where brick can be\r\nburned with oil at such a low cost as in the city of Chicago; the\r\nreason being that oil is not everywhere obtainable so cheaply as in\r\nthis city, and because few clays in the world are so easily burned\r\ninto brick as are the clays of Chicago. In Milwaukee, Wis., and in\r\nother places within a distance of 100 miles from Chicago, the time\r\nrequired to burn building brick with crude oil fuel averages from\r\nsixteen to twenty-one days, whereas the time of burning the Chicago\r\nclays averages only about five days, and splendid \"burns\" have been\r\nsecured there with crude oil in three and one-half days. It is\r\nevident, therefore, that the advantages of using crude oil fuel for\r\nthe burning of brick will vary in different parts of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWhere circumstances and the nature of the clay permit of its use,\r\ncrude oil is, next to fuel gas, the brickmakers' ideal fuel.--_The\r\nBrickmaker_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATION OF A MOUND NEAR JEFFERSON CITY, MO.\r\n\r\nBy A.S. LOGAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently, a party consisting of engineers and employes of the Missouri\r\nRiver Improvement Commission began an exploration of one of the\r\nmounds, a work of a prehistoric race, situated on the bluff, which\r\noverlooks the Missouri River from an elevation of one hundred and\r\nfifty feet, located about six miles below Jefferson City.\r\n\r\nThis mound is one of about twenty embraced in a circle one quarter of\r\na mile in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe above party selected the mound in question apparently at\r\nhaphazard; all the mounds presenting nearly a uniform outline,\r\ndiffering only in size and mostly circular in form, and from twenty to\r\ntwenty-four feet at the base, rising to a height of eight feet and\r\nunder. A trench was cut on a level with the natural soil, penetrating\r\nthe mound about eight feet. A stone wall was encountered which was\r\nbuilt very substantially, making access in that direction difficult,\r\nin consequence of which the earth was removed from the top for the\r\npurpose of entering from that direction. The earth was removed for a\r\ndepth of four feet, when the top of the wall was exposed. Further\r\nexcavation brought to light human bones, some of them fairly well\r\npreserved, especially the bones of the legs. On the removal of these\r\nand a layer of clay, another layer of bones was exposed, but\r\npresenting a different appearance than the first, having evidently\r\nbeen burned or charred, a considerable quantity of charcoal being\r\nmixed with the bones. In this tier were found portions of several\r\nskulls, lying close together, as if they had been interred without\r\nregard to order. They were, in all probability, detached from the body\r\nwhen buried.\r\n\r\nThe portions of the skulls found were those of the back of the head,\r\nno frontal bones being discovered. Some jaw bones with the teeth\r\nattached were among the remains, but only that portion of the jaw\r\ncontaining the molar teeth.\r\n\r\nA few pieces of flint weapons were found in the upper layers, and\r\nnothing else of any significance.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the diggers abandoned the search, and some days later\r\nthe writer, desirous of seeing all that was to be seen, resumed the\r\nwork and removed the earth and remains until the bottom of the vault\r\nwas reached; several layers being thus removed. All of these had\r\nevidently been burned, as charcoal and ashes were mixed with the bones\r\nof each succeeding layer. The layers were about an inch in thickness,\r\nwith from two to four inches of earth between, and small flat stones,\r\nabout the size of a man's hand, spread on each different layer, as if\r\nto mark its division from the next above.\r\n\r\nBetween the bottom layers, mixed with charcoal, ashes and small\r\nportions of burned bones were found what gives value to the search,\r\nnumbering about fifty tools and a smoking pipe.\r\n\r\nThe material of the tools is the same as the rock forming the vault,\r\nlocally known as \"cotton rock.\" I would consider it a species of\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nOverlying the edge of \"cotton rock\" in the bluff is flint in great\r\nquantities, and in every conceivable shape, that these people could\r\nhave resorted to had they been so disposed, and why they used the\r\nsofter material I will leave to some archæologist to determine. The\r\ntools themselves are made after no pattern, but selected for their\r\ncutting qualities, as they all have a more or less keen edge which\r\ncould be used for cutting purposes, and were no doubt highly prized,\r\nas they were found all in a pile in one corner of the vault and on top\r\nof which was found a stone pipe. The pipe is made bowl and stem\r\ntogether, and it is curious that people of such crude ideas of tools\r\nand weapons should manufacture such a perfect specimen of a pipe. It\r\nis composed of a very heavy stone, the nature of which would be\r\ndifficult to determine, as it is considerably burned.\r\n\r\nA description of the vault will be found interesting to many. The wall\r\nof the vault rests upon the natural surface of the ground, about three\r\nfeet high and eight and a half feet square, the inside corners being\r\nslightly rounded; it is built in layers about four inches in thickness\r\nand varying in length upward to three feet, neither cement nor mortar\r\nbeing used in the joints; the corners formed a sort of recess as they\r\nwere drawn inward to the top, in which many of the stones were found.\r\nThe stone for constructing the vault was brought from a distance of\r\nabout a quarter of a mile, as there is none in sight nearer.\r\n\r\nI assume from all these circumstances that these people lived in this\r\nneighborhood anterior to the age of flint tools, as the more recent\r\ninterments indicate that they were then entering upon the flint\r\nindustry, and it may be that the \"cotton rock\" had become obsolete.\r\n\r\nThese people buried their dead on the highest ground, covering and\r\nprotecting them with these great mounds, when it would seem much\r\neasier to bury as at the present day; but instead, they, with great\r\nlabor, carried the rock from a great distance, and it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose, also, that the earth was brought from a distance with which\r\nthey are surrounded, and piled high above, as there is no trace of an\r\nimmediate or local excavation.\r\n\r\nIn my view from the mounds and their surroundings I would\r\nunhesitatingly say the water, the foot hills of the glacier and the\r\nswamps left in its wake were but a short distance to the north of\r\nthem, and during the summer months the melting ice would send a volume\r\nof water down this valley that the Missouri River of to-day is but a\r\nminiature of, and therefore the highest hills were the only land that\r\ncould be used by that ancient race.\r\n\r\nIn this connection I would make the following suggestions that may\r\nlead to more important disclosures: My object is the hope of a more\r\nthorough investigation at some future time. Nearer to the top of the\r\nmound was found, certainly, the remains of a people of more recent\r\ndate than those found in the vault, as their bones were larger, which\r\nwould indicate a more stalwart tribe, and also their mode of burial\r\nwas different, as there was no indication of fire being used, as was\r\nthe case with the lower burials. I would pronounce the upper\r\ninterments those of Indians of the present day; the tools found with\r\nthese were weapons of the chase. On the other hand, those found in the\r\nvault were of a peaceful character, and their surroundings would\r\nreadily comport, in my opinion, to the glacial period. The entire\r\nabsence of flint in the bottom of the mound would show one of two\r\nthings, either they were unacquainted with the use of flint or at that\r\ntime there was no flint to be had. It is there now in great abundance,\r\nin such forms for cutting purposes that would render the \"cotton rock\"\r\nalmost useless. The flint is found in a hill close to the river bank,\r\nabout half a mile from the mound, and the upper portion of the ledge\r\nhas the appearance, to me, of glacial action and probably forms a\r\nmoraine, as it has, evidently, been pushed over the underlying ledge,\r\nand been ground and splintered in a manner that could not have been\r\nwithout great crushing force. It would be reasonable enough to suppose\r\nthat the action of the river may have uncovered this flint by washing\r\naway the softer material since the occupation of the older race.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the Indian interment in the examined mound, I could not\r\nsay distinctly whether the Indian burials had been such as to make\r\nthem aware of former burials or not, but I think from the thickness of\r\nthe clay between the two that they were ignorant of former burials.\r\nThe mounds of the modern Indian, so far as my investigations are\r\nconcerned, would indicate a more rudely formed structure which would\r\nappear to be an imitation of the older mounds, as they are not\r\nfinished with like care nor have they the ulterior structures.--_The\r\nScientist_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION OF CAUSTIC SODA ON WOOD.\r\n\r\nBy M.H. TAUSS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researches of the author upon the action which water exerts upon\r\nwood at a high temperature have shown how much of the incrusting\r\nmaterial can be removed without the aid of any reagent.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the manufacture of cellulose, it is also\r\ninteresting to prosecute at the same time experiments with solutions\r\nof the caustic alkalies, in order to study the mode of action upon\r\nboth wood and pure cellulose. The manufacture of cellulose has for\r\nmany years been an industry, and yet little or nothing from a chemical\r\npoint of view is known of the action of caustic soda upon vegetable\r\nfibers.\r\n\r\nBraconnot, in 1820, obtained alumina by treating wood with an alkali,\r\nbut the first application of wood to the manufacture of paper was due\r\nto Chauchard. By boiling vegetable fibers with caustic lyes, Collier\r\nand Piette obtained cellulose. Again, in 1862, Barne and Blondel\r\nproposed to make cellulose in a similar way, but employed nitric acid\r\nin the place of soda.\r\n\r\nThe first cellulose made exclusively from wood and caustic soda was\r\nproduced at the Manayunk Wood Pulp Works, in 1854, in the neighborhood\r\nof Philadelphia, by Burgess & Watt. The operation consisted in\r\ntreating the wood for six hours at a pressure of from six to eight\r\natmospheres, with a solution of caustic soda of 12° B.\r\n\r\nUngerer noticed that it was sufficient to limit the pressure from\r\nthree to six atmospheres, according to the quality of the wood, and\r\nadvised the use of solutions containing four to five per cent. of\r\ncaustic soda. He employed a series of cylinders, arranged vertically,\r\nin which the wood was subjected to a methodical system of lixiviation.\r\nThe same lye passed through many cylinders, so that when it made its\r\nexit at the end it was thoroughly exhausted, and the wood thus kept\r\ncoming in contact with fresh alkaline solutions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the account of Kiclaner, the disintegration of wood may\r\nbe effected in the following four ways:\r\n\r\n    1. By heating direct in boilers at a pressure of 10\r\n    atmospheres. (See Dresel and Rosehain.)\r\n\r\n    2. In vertical boilers heated direct or by steam, and kept at\r\n    a pressure of from 10 to 14 atmospheres. (Sinclair, Nicol, and\r\n    Behrend.)\r\n\r\n    3. In revolving boilers, maintained at a pressure of 12\r\n    atmospheres by direct steam.\r\n\r\n    4. By means of a series of small vessels communicating with\r\n    each other, and through which a lye circulates at a pressure\r\n    of six atmospheres. (Ungerer.)\r\n\r\nThis latter process is preferable to the others.\r\n\r\nResearches have also been made by the author in order to ascertain the\r\nloss which wood and cellulose suffer at different temperatures or in\r\ncontact with varying quantities of alkali (NaHO).\r\n\r\nThe following is a _resumé_ of the experiments, giving the loss in per\r\ncent. resulting from a \"cooking\" of three hours duration:\r\n\r\n  I.

Moissan to the current number\r\nof the _Comptes Rendus_, describing two interesting new compounds\r\ncontaining boron, phosphorus, and iodine. A few months ago M. Moissan\r\nsucceeded in preparing the iodide of boron, a beautiful substance of\r\nthe composition BI_{3}, crystallizing from solution in carbon bisulphide\r\nin pearly tables, which melt at 43° to a liquid which boils\r\nundecomposed at 210°. When this substance is brought in contact with\r\nfused phosphorus an intense action occurs, the whole mass inflames\r\nwith evolution of violet vapor of iodine. Red phosphorus also reacts\r\nwith incandescence when heated in the vapor of boron iodide. The\r\nreaction may, however, be moderated by employing solutions of\r\nphosphorus and boron iodide in dry carbon bisulphide. The two\r\nsolutions are mixed in a tube closed at one end, a little phosphorus\r\nbeing in excess, and the tube is then sealed. No external application\r\nof heat is necessary. At first the liquid is quite clear, but in a few\r\nminutes a brown solid substance commences to separate, and in three\r\nhours the reaction is complete. The substance is freed from carbon\r\nbisulphide in a current of carbon dioxide, the last traces being\r\nremoved by means of the Sprengel pump. The compound thus obtained is a\r\ndeep red amorphous powder, readily capable of volatilization. It melts\r\nbetween 190° and 200°. When heated _in vacuo_ it commences to\r\nvolatilize about 170°, and the vapor condenses in the cooler portion\r\nof the tube in beautiful red crystals. Analyses of these crystals\r\nagree perfectly with the formula BPI_{2}. Boron phospho-di-iodide is a\r\nvery hygroscopic substance, moisture rapidly decomposing it. In\r\ncontact with a large excess of water, yellow phosphorus is deposited,\r\nand hydriodic, boric, and phosphorus acids formed in the solution. A\r\nsmall quantity of phosphureted hydrogen also escapes. If a small\r\nquantity of water is used, a larger deposit of yellow phosphorus is\r\nformed, together with a considerable quantity of phosphonium iodide.\r\nStrong nitric acid oxidizes boron phospho-di-iodide with\r\nincandescence. Dilute nitric acid oxidizes it to phosphoric and boric\r\nacids. It burns spontaneously in chlorine, forming boron chloride,\r\nchloride of iodine, and pentachloride of phosphorus. When slightly\r\nwarmed in oxygen it inflames, the combustion being rendered very\r\nbeautiful by the fumes of boric and phosphoric anhydrides and the\r\nviolet vapors of iodine. Heated in contact with sulphureted hydrogen,\r\nit forms sulphides of boron and phosphorus and hydriodic acid, without\r\nliberation of iodine. Metallic magnesium when slightly warmed reacts\r\nwith it with incandescence. When thrown into vapor of mercury, boron\r\nphospho-di-iodide instantly takes fire.\r\n\r\nThe second phospho-iodide of boron obtained by M. Moissan is\r\nrepresented by the formula BPI. It is formed when sodium or magnesium\r\nin a fine state of division is allowed to act upon a solution of the\r\ndi-iodide just described in carbon bisulphide; or when boron\r\nphospho-di-iodide is heated to 160° in a current of hydrogen. It is\r\nobtained in the form of a bright red powder, somewhat hygroscopic. It\r\nvolatilizes _in vacuo_ without fusion at a temperature about 210°, and\r\nthe vapor condenses in the cooler portion of the tube in beautiful\r\norange colored crystals. When heated to low redness it decomposes into\r\nfree iodine and phosphide of boron, BP. Nitric acid reacts\r\nenergetically with it, but without incandescence, and a certain amount\r\nof iodine is liberated. Sulphuric acid decomposes it upon warming,\r\nwithout formation of sulphurous and boric acids and free iodine. By\r\nthe continued action of dry hydrogen upon the heated compound the\r\niodine and a portion of the phosphorus are removed, and a new phosphide\r\nof boron, of the composition B_{5}P_{3}, is obtained.--_Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORON SALTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA paper upon the sulphides of boron is communicated by M. Paul\r\nSabatier to the September number of the _Bulletin de la Societe\r\nChimique. Nature_ gives the following: Hitherto only one compound of\r\nboron with sulphur has been known to us, the trisulphide, B_{2}S_{3},\r\nand concerning even that our information has been of the most\r\nincomplete description. Berzelius obtained this substance in an impure\r\nform by heating boron in sulphur vapor, but the first practical mode\r\nof its preparation in a state of tolerable purity was that employed by\r\nWohler and Deville. These chemists prepared it by allowing dry\r\nsulphureted hydrogen gas to stream over amorphous boron heated to\r\nredness. Subsequently a method of obtaining boron sulphide was\r\nproposed by Fremy, according to which a mixture of boron trioxide,\r\nsoot, and oil is heated in a stream of the vapor of carbon bisulphide.\r\nM. Sabatier finds that the best results are obtained by employing the\r\nmethod of Wohler and Deville. The reaction between boron and\r\nsulphureted hydrogen only commences at red heat, near the temperature\r\nof the softening of glass. When, however, the tube containing the\r\nboron becomes raised to the temperature, boron sulphide condenses in\r\nthe portion of the tube adjacent to the heated portion; at first it is\r\ndeposited in a state of fusion, and the globules on cooling present an\r\nopaline aspect. Further along the tube it is slowly deposited in a\r\nporcelain like form, while further still the sublimate of sulphide\r\ntakes the form of brilliant acicular crystals. The crystals consist of\r\npure B_{2}S_{3}; the vitreous modification, however, is usually\r\ncontaminated with a little free sulphur. Very fine crystals of the\r\ntrisulphide may be obtained by heating a quantity of the\r\nporcelain-like form to 300° at the bottom of a closed tube whose upper\r\nportion is cooled by water. The crystals are violently decomposed by\r\nwater, yielding a clear solution of boric acid, sulphureted hydrogen\r\nbeing evolved. On examining the porcelain boat in which the boron had\r\nbeen placed, a non-volatile black substance is found, which appears to\r\nconsist of a lower sulphide of the composition B_{4}S. The same\r\nsubstance is obtained when the trisulphide is heated in a current of\r\nhydrogen; a portion volatilizes, and is deposited again further along\r\nthe tube, while the residue fuses, and becomes reduced to the\r\nunalterable subsulphide B_{4}S, sulphureted hydrogen passing away in\r\nthe stream of gas.\r\n\r\nTwo selenides of boron, B_{2}Se_{3} and B_{4}Se, corresponding to the\r\nabove described sulphides, have also been prepared by M. Sabatier, by\r\nheating amorphous boron in a stream of hydrogen selenide, H_{2}Se. The\r\ntriselenide is less volatile than the trisulphide, and is pale green\r\nin color. It is energetically decomposed by water, with formation of\r\nboric acid and liberation of hydrogen selenide. The liquid rapidly\r\ndeposits free selenium, owing to the oxidation of the hydrogen\r\nselenide retained in solution. Light appears to decompose the\r\ntriselenide into free selenium and the subselenide B_{4}Se.\r\n\r\nSilicon selenide, SiSe_{3}, has likewise been obtained by M. Sabatier\r\nby heating crystalline silicon to redness in a current of hydrogen\r\nselenide. It presents the appearance of a fused hard metallic mass\r\nincapable of volatilization. Water reacts most vigorously with it,\r\nproducing silicic acid, and liberating hydrogen selenide. Potash\r\ndecomposes it with formation of a clear solution, the silica being\r\nliberated in a form in which it is readily dissolved by alkalies.\r\nSilicon selenide emits a very irritating odor, due to the hydrogen\r\nselenide which is formed by its reaction with the moisture of the\r\natmosphere. When heated to redness in the air it becomes converted\r\ninto silicon dioxide and free selenium.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL SULPHIDE OF GOLD.\r\n\r\nBy T.W.T. ATHERTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of gold in the form of a natural sulphide in conjunction\r\nwith pyrites has often been advanced theoretically as a possible\r\noccurrence, but up to the present time this occurrence has, I believe,\r\nnever been established as an actual fact.\r\n\r\nDuring my investigations on the ore of the Deep Creek Mines, I have\r\nfound in them what I believe to be gold existing as a natural\r\nsulphide. The description of this ore will, no doubt, be of interest\r\nto your readers.\r\n\r\nThe lode is a large irregular one of pure arsenical pyrites, existing\r\nin a felsite dike near the sea coast. Surrounding it on all sides are\r\nmicaceous schists, and in the neighborhood is a large hill of granite\r\nabout 800 ft. high. In the lode and the rock immediately adjoining it\r\nare large quantities of pyrophylite, and in some places of the mine\r\nare deposits of this pure white, translucent mineral, but in the ore\r\nitself it is a yellow and pale olive green color, and is never absent\r\nfrom the pyrites.\r\n\r\nFrom the first I was much struck with the exceedingly fine state of\r\ndivision in which the gold existed in the ore. After roasting and very\r\ncarefully grinding down in an agate mortar, I have never been able to\r\nget any pieces of gold exceeding the one-thousandth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and the greater quantity is very much finer than this.\r\nCareful dissolving of the pyrites and gangue, so as to leave the gold\r\nintact, failed to find it in any larger diameter. As this was a very\r\nunusual experience in investigations on many other kinds of pyrites, I\r\nwas led further into the matter. Ultimately, after a number of\r\nexperiments, there was nothing left but to test for gold as a\r\nsulphide.\r\n\r\nTaking 200 grammes of pyrites from a sample assaying 17 ounces fine\r\ngold per ton, grinding it finely, and; heating for some hours with a\r\nsolution of sodium sulphide (Na_{2}S_{2}), on decomposing the filtrate\r\nand treating it for gold I got a result at the rate of 12 ounces gold\r\nper ton. This was repeated several times with the same result.\r\n\r\nThis sample came from the lode at the 140 ft. level, while samples\r\nfrom the higher levels where the ore is more oxidized, although\r\ncarrying the gold in the same degree of fineness, do not give as high\r\na percentage of auric sulphide.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that all the gold in the pyrites (and I have never\r\nfound any apart from it) has originally taken its place there as a\r\nsulphide.\r\n\r\nThe sulphide is an analysis of a general sample of the ore:\r\n\r\n  Silica        13.940 p.c.\r\n  Alumina        6.592  \"\r\n  Lime           0.9025 \"\r\n  Sulphur       16.584  \"\r\n  Arsenic       33.267  \"\r\n  Iron          27.720  \"\r\n  Cobalt         0.964  \"\r\n\r\n                                 Per Ton.\r\n  Nickel                    Traces.\r\n  Gold                      5 ozs. 3 dwts. 8 grs.\r\n  Silver                    0 \"    16 \"    0 \"\r\n                -------\r\n                99.969\r\n\r\nNambucca Head's Gold Mining Company, Deep Creek, N.S.

The Slack and Brownlow\r\napparatus we will deal with first. This purifier is one which is\r\nintended to remove the matter in suspension in the water to be treated\r\nby subsidence and not by filtration. The apparatus consists of a\r\nvertical iron tank or cylinder, inside which are a series of plates\r\narranged in a spiral direction around a fixed center, and sloping at\r\nan angle of 45° on both sides outward. The water to be dealt with\r\nflows through a large inlet tube fixed to the bottom of the cylinder,\r\nrises to the top by passing spirally round the whole circumference,\r\nand depositing on the plates or shelves all solids and impurities at\r\nthe outer edges of the plates. Mud cocks are placed to remove the\r\nsolids deposited during the flow of the water upward to the outlet\r\npipe, placed close to the top of the cylinder. One of these tanks, a\r\nsquare one, is at work purifying the Medlock water at Manchester, and\r\non drawing samples of water from nearly every plate, that from the\r\nlower mud cock showed considerable deposit, which decreased in bulk\r\nuntil the top mud cock was reached, when the water was quite free from\r\ndeposit. It is stated that one man would be sufficient to attend to 20\r\nof these purifiers.\r\n\r\nTo filter or purify 2,000,000 gallons per 24 hours would require 40\r\ntanks, 10 ft. by 7 ft. diameter, each doing 2,000 gallons per hour,\r\nand would cost, with their fittings, £6,400, including all patent\r\nrights, but exclusive of lime mixing tanks, agitators, lime water and\r\nsoftening tanks, engine and boiler, and suitable buildings, the cost\r\nof which would not be far short of £5,000, or a total of £11,400 to\r\nsoften 2,000,000 gallons per 24 hours. The labor and other working\r\nexpenses in connection with this plant would not be less than that\r\nnecessary to work the Porter-Clark process, which is given as O.55d.\r\nper 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe Brock and Minton filter press system is another method. This\r\npatent press is made of steel, perforated with ½ inch holes. On the\r\ninside of the shell there is first laid a layer of fine wire netting,\r\nthen a layer of cloth, and lastly another layer of wire netting of a\r\nlarger mesh than the other. The matter treated is pumped into the body\r\nof the cylinder, the liquid passing through the filtering material to\r\nthe outside, the solids being retained inside, and are got rid of by\r\npartially revolving the upper half to relieve it from the knuckle\r\njoint, and, after being raised, the lower half is turned over by\r\nmachinery, and the solid matter is simply allowed to fall out into\r\nwagons or trucks run underneath for that purpose. Such, in brief, is\r\nthe manner of using this filter press for chemical works' purposes.\r\nThe cost of each filter press, including royalties, is from £250 to\r\n£300, the size being 8 ft. by 4 ft. diameter. Having a filtering area\r\nof 100 square feet, it would require 32 of these applied to softening\r\nwater to effectually deal with 2,000,000 gallons per 24 hours; this,\r\nat the lowest estimate for filters alone, would be £8,000, and, using\r\nthe same figures, £5,000 for lime mixing tanks, etc., as referred to\r\nin the \"Slack and Brownlow\" purifier, would bring the total cost up to\r\n£13,000, and the working expense would not be less than that required\r\nto work the Porter-Clark process, and would probably be very much\r\ngreater. This filter press is not in use anywhere for dealing with\r\nlarge quantities of water in connection with a town water supply.\r\n\r\nA process which has been working for a long time at Southampton is the\r\nAtkins system, which also includes the use of filter presses. The\r\npumping station and softening works are situated at Otterbourne, eight\r\nmiles from Southampton, and were built together as one scheme. The\r\nmixing room has two slaking lime tanks, with agitators driven by steam\r\npower. The mixture is then run as cream of lime into a tank 20 ft.\r\nsquare and is then pumped into the lower ends of two lime water\r\nproducing cylinders. The agitation is here obtained by pressure from a\r\nsmall cistern placed above them with a 12 ft. head, the pipe from\r\nwhich is attached to the lower ends of the cylinders. This has been\r\nfound by experiment to be the most satisfactory means of obtaining the\r\nproper degree of agitation necessary; the clear lime water is then\r\ndrawn off at the top of the cylinders, and flows by gravity into a\r\nmixer, where it comes in contact with the hard water. Both flow\r\ntogether into a distributing trough, from which it overflows into a\r\nsmall softening reservoir, having a capacity of one hour's supply, a\r\nweir being placed along the lower end, over which the water flows to\r\n13 filter presses. The clear water from the filters is then conveyed\r\nto a small well, from which the permanent engines raise it to the\r\nfirst of a series of high level covered service reservoirs.\r\n\r\nIn the filter press there are 20 hollow disks representing a filtering\r\narea of 250 square feet, or a total of 3,250 square feet. The water to\r\nbe filtered passes into the body of the filter and then through a\r\nfiltering medium of cloth laid on a thin perforated zinc plate, into\r\nthe inner side of the disks, from whence it is conveyed through the\r\nhollow shaft, to which the disks are attached, to the high level\r\npumps.\r\n\r\nThe filter cloths are cleaned three times every 24 hours, without\r\nremoval, by jets of softened water from the main, having a pressure of\r\n60 pounds to the square inch. During cleaning operations the disks are\r\nmade to revolve slowly; this only occupies a space of five minutes for\r\neach cleaning. The cloths last from six to eight months without being\r\nrenewed. They also occasionally use for further cleaning the cloths a\r\njet of steam injected upon the center of the disks in order to remove\r\nby partial boiling the insoluble particles engrained in the cloths.\r\nThis has been found to make the cloths last longer. This cloth is\r\nobtained from Porritt Bros. and Austen, Stubbing Vale, Ramsbottom, and\r\ncosts 13½d. per lineal yard of a width to suit the disks.\r\n\r\nThe quantity softened is 2¼ million gallons per 24 hours, but the\r\npresent plant can deal with 2½ million gallons, and the buildings are\r\nerected for 3½ million gallons, additional filters and lime producing\r\ntanks being only required to deal with the increased quantity. The\r\ncosts of the softening works was £10,394, of which £7,844 was for the\r\nsoftening machinery and plant and £2,550 for the reservoir, buildings,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe working expenses, including lime, labor, cloths, general repairs,\r\nand steam, is stated to be 0.225d. per 1,000 gallons, the labor\r\nrequired being only two men, one on the day and the other on the night\r\nshift, with an occasional man to assist.\r\n\r\nThe hardness of the Southampton water on Clark's scale is 18° of total\r\nhardness, and this is reduced down to 6° or 8° by this process.--_Chem.\r\nTr.

NEWTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis method is a synthetical one, and consists in passing a stream of\r\nhydrogen and bromine vapor over a spiral of platinum wire heated to\r\nbright redness by means of an electric current. A glass tube, about 7\r\ninches long and 5/8 of an inch bore, is fitted at each end with a cork\r\ncarrying a short straight piece of small tube; through each cork is\r\nalso fixed a stout wire, and these two wires are joined by means of a\r\nshort spiral of platinum wire, the spiral being about 1 inch long. One\r\nend of this apparatus is connected to a small wash bottle containing\r\nbromine, through which a stream of hydrogen can be bubbled. The other\r\nend is attached to a tube dipping into a vessel of water for the\r\nabsorption of the gas, or, if a large quantity of the solution is\r\nrequired, to a series of Woulf's bottles containing water. Hydrogen is\r\nfirst slowly passed through the tube until the air is displaced, when\r\nthe platinum spiral is heated to bright redness by the passage of a\r\nsuitable electric current. Complete combination takes place in contact\r\nwith the hot wire, and the color imparted to the ingoing gases by the\r\nbromine vapor is entirely removed, and the contents of the tube beyond\r\nthe platinum are perfectly colorless. The vessel containing the\r\nbromine may be heated to a temperature of about 60° C. in a water\r\nbath, at which temperature the hydrogen will be mixed with nearly the\r\nrequisite amount of bromine to combine with the whole of it. So long\r\nas even a slight excess of hydrogen is passing, which is readily seen\r\nby the escape of bubbles through the water in the absorbing vessels,\r\nthe issuing hydrobromic acid will remain perfectly colorless, and\r\ntherefore free from bromine; so that it is not necessary to adopt any\r\nof the usual methods for scrubbing the gas through vessels containing\r\nphosphorus. When the operation is proceeding very rapidly a lambent\r\nflame occasionally appears in the tube just before the platinum wire,\r\nbut this flame is never propagated back through the narrow tube into\r\nthe bromine bottle. The precaution may be taken, however, of plugging\r\nthis narrow tube with a little glass wool, which renders any\r\ninconvenience from this cause quite impossible. By this method a large\r\nquantity of bromine may be rapidly converted into hydrobromic acid\r\nwithout any loss of bromine, and the operation when once started can\r\nbe allowed to proceed without any further attention.--_Chemical News._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSAPOTIN: A NEW GLUCOSIDE.\r\n\r\nBy GUSTAVE MICHAUD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Achras Sapota, L._, is a large tree scattered through the forests of\r\nCentral America and the West Indies; its fruit is often seen upon the\r\nCreole dinner table. This fruit is a berry, the size of an orange, the\r\ntaste of which suggests the flavor of melon, as well as that of\r\nhydrocyanic acid. The fruit contains one or two seeds like large\r\nchestnuts, which, if broken, let fall a white almond. This last\r\ncontains the glucoside which I call _sapotin_.\r\n\r\nI obtained sapotin for the first time by heating dry raspings of the\r\nalmond with 90 per cent. alcohol. While cooling, the filtered liquid\r\ndeposited a good deal of the compound. Since that time I have\r\nadvantageously modified the process and increased the amount of\r\nproduct. I prepare sapotin in the following way: The almonds are\r\nrasped, dried at 100° C. and washed with benzene, which takes away an\r\nenormous quantity of fatty matter. The benzene which remains in the\r\nalmond is driven put first by compression, afterward by heating. Then\r\nthe raspings are exhausted with boiling 90 per cent. alcohol. The\r\nsolution is filtered as rapidly as possible, in order to avoid its\r\ncooling and depositing the sapotin in the filter. As soon as the\r\ntemperature of the filtered liquid begins to fall, a voluminous\r\nprecipitate is seen to form, which is the sapotin.\r\n\r\nIn order to purify it, the precipitate is collected in a filter and\r\nexpressed between sheets of filter paper. When dry it is washed with\r\nether, which takes away the last particles of fatty and resinous\r\nmatter. The purification is completed by two crystallizations from 90\r\nper cent. alcohol. At last the substance is dried at 100°.\r\n\r\nThe sapotin separates from its alcohol solution in the form of\r\nmicroscopic crystals. When dry, it is a white, inodorous powder. Its\r\ntaste is extremely acrid and burning. If the powder penetrate into the\r\nnostrils or the eyes, it produces a persistent burning sensation which\r\nbrings about sneezing and flow of tears. It melts at 240° C., growing\r\nbrown at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt has a laevo-rotatory power of [a]_{j} = -32.11, which was\r\ndetermined with an alcoholic solution, the aqueous solution not being\r\nsufficiently transparent.\r\n\r\nIt is very soluble in water, easily soluble in boiling alcohol, much\r\nless in cold alcohol, and insoluble in ether, chloroform and benzene.\r\nIts alcoholic solution is precipitated by ether.\r\n\r\nTannin has no action on it, but basic acetate of lead produces a\r\ngelatinous precipitate in its aqueous solution. Strange enough, this\r\nprecipitate is entirely soluble in a small excess of basic acetate of\r\nlead. If thrown into concentrated sulphuric acid, sapotin colors it\r\nwith a garnet red tint. It does not reduce Fehling's solution. Its\r\nanalysis gave the following results:\r\n\r\n         Calculated for                     Found.\r\n         C_{29}H_{52}O_{20}.         I.

One hundred parts of sapotin produce 51.58 parts of\r\nglucose and 49.67 of sapotiretin. The equation which represents this\r\nreaction is:\r\n\r\nC_{29}H_{52}O_{20} + 2H_{2}O = 2C_{6}H_{12}O_{6} + C_{17}H_{32}O_{10}\r\n\r\nand requires 50 per cent. of glucose and 55 per cent. of sapotiretin.\r\n\r\nSapotiretin is an amorphous compound, insoluble in water, very soluble\r\nin alcohol, less soluble in chloroform, insoluble in ether.

The oleate of lead is\r\nseparated by ether, and the residuum, consisting of palmitic and\r\narachic acids, is decomposed by hydrochloric acid. The fatty acids are\r\ndissolved, with the aid of heat, in 50 c.c. of 90 per cent. alcohol.\r\nThe arachic acid which separates after cooling is filtered out and\r\nwashed, first with 90 per cent. and afterward with 70 per cent.\r\nalcohol. It is then dissolved in hot alcohol, and the solution\r\nevaporated in a weighed saucer. The weight of the residuum, after\r\ntaking into account the acid dissolved in the alcohol, equals the\r\nwhole amount of arachic acid contained in the oil; the melting point\r\nof this residuum should be 70° to 71° C. With this process the author\r\nhas always been successful; but when the olive oil contains not more\r\nthan 5 to 10 per cent. of peanut oil, it is necessary to make the test\r\nwith 40 grms. of the former, otherwise the melting point of the\r\narachic acid cannot be estimated. Furthermore, the acids which are\r\nseparated from the lead salt by hydrochloric acid must be\r\nrecrystallized repeatedly with 90 per cent. alcohol, until the melting\r\npoint ceases to rise, in case the latter is not found to exceed 70° C.\r\nat the first estimation. When peanut oil is present, the melting point\r\nwill always be above 70°.--_Chem.

Lobry de Bruyn,\r\nand a preliminary account of its mode of preparation and properties is\r\npublished by him in the current number of the _Recueil des travaux\r\nchimiques des Pays-Bas_ (1891, 10, 101). The manner in which the free\r\nbase was obtained was briefly as follows. About a hundred grammes of\r\nhydroxylamine hydrochloride, NH_{2}OH.HCl, were dissolved in six\r\nhundred cubic centimeters of warm methyl alcohol. To this solution a\r\nquantity of sodium dissolved in methyl alcohol was added, in such\r\nproportion that the hydrochloride of hydroxylamine was present in\r\nslight excess over and above that required to convert it to sodium\r\nchloride. After deposition of the separated sodium chloride the\r\nsolution was decanted and filtered.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the methyl alcohol was next removed by\r\ndistillation under the reduced pressure of 160-200 mm. The remainder\r\nwas then treated with anhydrous ether, in order to completely\r\nprecipitate the last traces of dissolved sodium chloride. The liquid\r\neventually separated into two layers, an upper ethereal layer\r\ncontaining about 5 per cent. of hydroxylamine, and a lower layer\r\ncontaining over 50 per cent. of hydroxylamine, the remainder of the\r\nmethyl alcohol, and a little dissolved salt. By subjecting this lower\r\nlayer to fractional distillation under 60 mm. pressure, it was\r\nseparated into three fractions, of which the first contained 27 per\r\ncent. of hydroxylamine, the second 60 per cent., and the third\r\ncrystallized in the ice-cooled receiver in long needles. This third\r\nfraction consisted of free solid NH_{2}OH. Hydroxylamine as thus\r\nisolated in the free state is a very hygroscopic substance, which\r\nrapidly liquefies when exposed to air, owing to the absorption of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe crystals melt at 33°, and the fused substance appears to possess\r\nthe capability of readily dissolving metallic salts. Sodium chloride\r\nis very largely soluble in the liquid; powdered niter melts at once in\r\ncontact with it, and the two liquids then mix. Free hydroxylamine is\r\nwithout odor. It is heavier than water. When rapidly heated upon\r\nplatinum foil it suddenly decomposes in a most violent manner, with\r\nproduction of a large sheet of bright yellow flame. It is only very\r\nslightly soluble in liquid carbon compounds, such as chloroform,\r\nbenzene, ether, acetic ether, and carbon bisulphide. The vapor attacks\r\ncorks, so that the solid requires to be preserved in glass-stoppered\r\nbottles. The free base appears also to act upon cellulose, for, upon\r\nplacing a few drops of the melted substance upon filter paper, a\r\nconsiderable amount of heat is evolved. The pure crystals are very\r\nstable, the base in the free state appearing to possess much greater\r\nstability than when dissolved in water. The instability of the\r\nsolution appears, however, to be influenced to a considerable extent\r\nby the alkalinity of the glass of the containing vessel, for\r\nconcentrated solutions free from dissolved alkali are found to be\r\nperfectly stable. Bromine and iodine react in a remarkable manner with\r\nfree hydroxylamine.\r\n\r\nCrystals of iodine dissolve instantly in contact with it, with\r\nevolution of a gas and considerable rise of temperature. Bromine\r\nreacts with violence, a gas again being explosively evolved and\r\nhydrobromic acid formed. The nature of the gas evolved is now\r\nundergoing investigation. A letter from M. Lobry de Bruyn appears in\r\nthe number of the _Chemiker Zeitung_ for October 31, warning those who\r\nmay attempt to prepare free hydroxylamine by the above method that it\r\nis a dangerously explosive substance when warmed to a temperature of\r\n80°-100°. Upon warming a flask containing the free solid base upon a\r\nwater bath a most violent explosion occurs. A spontaneous\r\ndecomposition appears to set in about 80°, and even in open vessels\r\nthe explosion is very violent. Care must also be taken during the\r\nfractional distillation of the concentrated solution in methyl alcohol\r\nto cool the apparatus before changing the receiver, as if air is\r\nadmitted while the retort is heated the experiment ends with an\r\nexplosion.--_Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\n\r\nARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS EDITION\r\n\r\n$2.50 a Year.
