S.,\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR OF PATHOLOGY AND OPERATIVE SURGERY IN THE VETERINARY COLLEGE\r\nOF PHILADELPHIA; LATE PROFESSOR OF VETERINARY MEDICINE IN THE\r\nAGRICULTURAL COLLEGE OF OHIO; SECRETARY OF THE AMERICAN VETERINARY\r\nASSOCIATION OF PHILADELPHIA; AUTHOR OF \"THE HORSE AND HIS DISEASES,\"\r\n\"CATTLE AND THEIR DISEASES,\" ETC., ETC.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith Numerous Illustrations.\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA:\r\n\r\nJOHN E. POTTER AND COMPANY. 617 SANSOM STREET\r\n\r\nEntered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1864, by\r\n\r\nJOHN E. POTTER,\r\n\r\nIn the Clerk's Office of the District Court of the United States, in and\r\nfor the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the favorable reception of his former works, the author\r\npresents in the following pages what is intended by him as a popular\r\ncompendium relative to Sheep, Swine, and Poultry.\r\n\r\nIt would not have been a difficult matter to collect material bearing\r\nupon each distinct class sufficient for an entire volume of the present\r\nsize. Indeed, the main trouble experienced has been the selecting of\r\nsuch facts and suggestions only as seemed to him of paramount practical\r\nimportance. He has not deemed it advisable to cumber his work with items\r\nof information which could be of service to particular sections and\r\nlocalities only; but has rather endeavored to present, in a concise, yet\r\ncomprehensible shape, whatever is essential to be understood concerning\r\nthe animals in question.\r\n\r\nThe amateur stock-raiser and the wealthy farmer will, of course, call to\r\ntheir aid all the works, no matter how expensive or voluminous, which\r\nare to be found bearing upon the subject in which they are for the time\r\ninterested. The present volume can scarcely be expected to fill the\r\nniche which such might desire to see occupied.\r\n\r\nThe author's experience as a veterinary surgeon among the great body of\r\nour farmers convinces him that what is needed by them in the premises is\r\na treatise, of convenient size, containing the essential features of the\r\ntreatment and management of each, couched in language free from\r\ntechnicality or rarely scientific expressions, and fortified by the\r\nresults of actual experience upon the farm.\r\n\r\nSuch a place the author trusts this work may occupy. He hopes that,\r\nwhile it shall not be entirely destitute of interest for any, it will\r\nprove acceptable, in a peculiar degree, to that numerous and thrifty\r\nclass of citizens to which allusion has already been made.\r\n\r\nThe importance of such a work cannot be overrated. Take the subject of\r\nsheep for example: the steadily growing demand for woollen goods of\r\nevery description is producing a great and lucrative development of the\r\nwool trade. Even light fabrics of wool are now extensively preferred\r\nthroughout the country to those of cotton. Our imports of wool from\r\nEngland during the past six years have increased at an almost incredible\r\nrate, while our productions of the article during the past few years\r\ngreatly exceed that of the same period in any portion of our history.\r\n\r\nRelative to swine, moreover, it may be said that they form so\r\nconsiderable an item of our commerce that a thorough information as to\r\nthe best mode of raising and caring for them is highly desirable; while\r\nour domestic poultry contribute so much, directly and indirectly, to the\r\ncomfort and partial subsistence of hundreds of thousands, that sensible\r\nviews touching that division will be of service in almost every\r\nhousehold.\r\n\r\nTo those who are familiar with the author's previous works upon the\r\nHorse and Cattle, it is needless to say any thing as to the method\r\nadopted by him in discussing the subject of Diseases. To others he would\r\nsay, that only such diseases are described as are likely to be actually\r\nencountered, and such curatives recommended as his own personal\r\nexperience, or that of others upon whose judgment he relies, has\r\nsatisfied him are rational and valuable.\r\n\r\nThe following works, among others, have been consulted: Randall's Sheep\r\nHusbandry; Youatt on Sheep; Goodale's Breeding of Domestic Animals;\r\nAllen's Domestic Animals; Stephens's Book of the Farm; Youatt on the\r\nHog; Richardson on the Hog; Dixon and Kerr's Ornamental and Domestic\r\nPoultry; Bennett's Poultry Book; and Browne's American Poultry Yard.\r\n\r\nTo those professional brethren who have so courteously furnished him\r\nwith valuable information, growing out of their own observation and\r\npractice, he acknowledges himself especially indebted; and were he\r\ncertain that they would not take offence, he would be pleased to mention\r\nthem here by name.\r\n\r\nShould the work prove of service to our intelligent American farmers and\r\nstock-breeders as a body, the author's end will have been attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n  SHEEP AND THEIR DISEASES.\r\n

family which presents so great a diversity of size, color, form,\r\ncovering, and general appearance, as characterizes the sheep; and none\r\noccupy a wider range of climate, or subsist on a greater variety of\r\nfood. This animal is found in every latitude between the Equator and the\r\nArctic circle, ranging over barren mountains and through fertile\r\nvalleys, feeding upon almost every species of edible forage--the\r\ncultivated grasses, clovers, cereals, and roots--browsing on aromatic\r\nand bitter herbs alike, cropping the leaves and barks from stunted\r\nforest shrubs and the pungent, resinous evergreens. In some parts of\r\nNorway and Sweden, when other resources fail, he subsists on fish or\r\nflesh during the long, rigorous winter, and, if reduced to necessity,\r\neven devours his own wool.\r\n\r\nIn size, he is diminutive or massive; he has many horns, or but two\r\nlarge or small spiral horns, or is polled or hornless. His tail may be\r\nbroad, or long, or a mere button, discoverable only by the touch. His\r\ncovering is long and coarse, or short and hairy, or soft and furry, or\r\nfine and spiral. His color varies from white or black to every shade of\r\nbrown, dun, buff, blue, and gray. This wide diversity results from long\r\ndomestication under almost every conceivable variety of condition.\r\n\r\nAmong the antediluvians, sheep were used for sacrificial offerings, and\r\ntheir fleeces, in all probability, furnished them with clothing. Since\r\nthe deluge their flesh has been a favorite food among many nations. Many\r\nof the rude, wandering tribes of the East employ them as beasts of\r\nburden. The uncivilized--and, to some extent, the refined--inhabitants\r\nof Europe use their milk, not only as a beverage, but for making into\r\ncheese, butter, and curds--an appropriation of it which is also noticed\r\nby Job, Isaiah, and other Old Testament writers, as well as most of the\r\nGreek and Roman authors. The ewe's milk scarcely differs in appearance\r\nfrom that of the cow, though it is generally thicker, and yields a pale,\r\nyellowish butter, which is always soft and soon becomes rancid. In dairy\r\nregions the animal is likewise frequently employed at the tread-mill or\r\nhorizontal wheel, to pump water, churn milk, or perform other light\r\ndomestic work.\r\n\r\nThe calling of the shepherd has, from time immemorial, been conspicuous,\r\nand not wanting in dignity and importance. Abel was a keeper of sheep;\r\nas were Abraham and his descendants, as well as most of the ancient\r\npatriarchs. Job possessed fourteen thousand sheep. Rachel, the favored\r\nmother of the Jewish race, \"came with her father's sheep, for she kept\r\nthem.\" The seven daughters of the priest of Midian \"came and drew water\r\nfor their father's flocks.\" Moses, the statesman and lawgiver, \"learned\r\nin all the wisdom of the Egyptians,\" busied himself in tending \"the\r\nflocks of Jethro, his father-in-law.\" David, too, that sweet singer of\r\nIsrael and its destined monarch--the Jewish hero, poet, and divine--was\r\na keeper of sheep. To shepherds, \"abiding in the field, keeping watch\r\nover their flocks by night,\" came the glad tidings of a Saviour's birth.\r\nThe Hebrew term for sheep signifies, in its etymology, fruitfulness,\r\nabundance, plenty--indicative of the blessings which they were destined\r\nto confer upon the human family. In the Holy Scriptures, this animal is\r\nthe chosen symbol of purity and the gentler virtues, the victim of\r\npropitiatory sacrifices, and the type of redemption to fallen man.\r\n\r\nAmong profane writers, Homer and Hesiod, Virgil and Theocritus,\r\nintroduce them in their pastoral themes; while their heroes and\r\ndemi-gods--Hercules and Ulysses, Eneas and Numa--carefully perpetuate\r\nthem in their domains.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, they have engaged the attention of the most enlightened\r\nnations, whose prosperity has been intimately linked with them, wherever\r\nwool and its manufactures have been regarded as essential staples. Spain\r\nand Portugal, during the two centuries in which they figured as the\r\nmost enterprising European countries, excelled in the production and\r\nmanufacture of wool. Flanders, for a time, took precedence of England in\r\nthe perfection of the arts and the enjoyments of life; and the latter\r\ncountry then sent what little wool she raised to the former to be\r\nmanufactured. This being soon found highly impolitic, large bounties\r\nwere offered by England for the importation of artists and machinery;\r\nand by a systematic and thorough course of legislation, which looked to\r\nthe utmost protection and increase of wool and woollens, she gradually\r\ncarried their production beyond any thing the world had ever seen.\r\n\r\nOf the original breed of this invaluable animal, nothing certain is\r\nknown; four varieties having been deemed by naturalists entitled to that\r\ndistinction.\r\n\r\nThese are, 1. The _Musimon_, inhabiting Corsica, Sardinia, and other\r\nislands of the Mediterranean, the mountainous parts of Spain and Greece,\r\nand some other regions bordering upon that inland sea. These have been\r\nfrequently domesticated and mixed with the long-cultivated breeds.\r\n\r\n2. The _Argali_ ranges over the steppes, or inland plains of Central\r\nAsia, northward and eastward to the ocean. They are larger and hardier\r\nthan the Musimon and not so easily tamed.\r\n\r\n3. The _Rocky Mountain Sheep_--frequently called the _Bighorn_ by our\r\nwestern hunters--is found on the prairies west of the Mississippi, and\r\nthroughout the wild, mountainous regions extending through California\r\nand Oregon to the Pacific. They are larger than the Argali--which in\r\nother respects they resemble--and are probably descended from them,\r\nsince they could easily cross upon the ice at Behring's Straits, from\r\nthe north-eastern coast of Asia. Like the Argali, when caught young\r\nthey are readily tamed; but it is not known that they have ever been\r\nbred with the domestic sheep. Before the country was overrun by the\r\nwhite ram, they probably inhabited the region bordering on the\r\nMississippi. Father Hennepin--a French Jesuit, who wrote some two\r\nhundred years ago--often speaks of meeting with goats in his travels\r\nthrough the territory which is now embraced by Illinois, Wisconsin, and\r\na portion of Minnesota. The wild, clambering propensities of these\r\nanimals--occupying, as they do, the giddy heights far beyond the reach\r\nof the traveller--and their outer coating of hair--supplied underneath,\r\nhowever, with a thick coating of soft wool--give them much the\r\nappearance of goats. In summer they are generally found single; but when\r\nthey descend from their isolated, rocky heights in winter, they are\r\ngregarious, marching in flocks under the guidance of leaders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROCKY MOUNTAIN SHEEP.]\r\n\r\n4. The _Bearded Sheep of Africa_ inhabit the mountains of Barbary and\r\nEgypt. They are covered with a soft, reddish hair, and have a mane\r\nhanging below the neck, and large, locks of hair at the ankle.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of the domesticated sheep--that is, all the subjugated\r\nspecies--apparently differ less from their wild namesakes than from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe _fat-rumped_ and the _broad-tailed sheep_ are much more extensively\r\ndiffused than any other, and occupy nearly all the south-eastern part of\r\nEurope, Western and Central Asia, and Northern Africa. They are\r\nsupposed, from various passages in the Pentateuch in which \"the fat and\r\nthe rump\" are spoken of in connection with offerings, to be the\r\nvarieties which were propagated by the patriarchs and their descendants,\r\nthe Jewish race. They certainly give indisputable evidence of remote and\r\ncontinued subjugation. Their long, pendent, drowsy ears, and the highly\r\nartificial posterior developments, are characteristic of no wild or\r\nrecently domesticated race.\r\n\r\nThis breed consists of numerous sub-varieties, differing in all their\r\ncharacteristics of size, fleece, color, etc., with quite as many and\r\nmarked shades of distinction as the modern European varieties. In\r\nMadagascar, they are covered with hair; in the south of Africa, with\r\ncoarse wool; in the Levant, and along the Mediterranean, the wool is\r\ncomparatively fine; and from that of the fat-rumped sheep of Thibet the\r\nexquisite Cashmere shawls of commerce are manufactured. Both rams and\r\newes are sometimes bred with horns, and sometimes without, and they\r\nexhibit a great diversity of color. Some yield a carcass of scarcely\r\nthirty pounds, while others have weighed two hundred pounds dressed. The\r\ntail or rump varies greatly, according to the purity and style of\r\nbreeding; some are less than one-eighth, while others exceed one-third\r\nof the entire dressed weight. The fat of the rump or tail is esteemed a\r\ngreat delicacy; in hot climates resembling oil, and in colder, suet.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether sheep are indigenous to Great Britain; but they\r\nare mentioned as existing there at very early periods.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SHEEP.\r\n\r\nIn North America, there are none, strictly speaking, except the Rocky\r\nMountain breed, already mentioned. The broad-tailed sheep of Asia and\r\nAfrica were brought into the United States about seventy years ago,\r\nunder the name of the Tunisian Mountain sheep, and bred with the native\r\nflocks. Some of them were subsequently distributed among the farmers of\r\nPennsylvania, and their mixed descendants were highly prized as\r\nprolific, and good nurses, coming early to maturity, attaining large\r\nweight, of a superior quality of carcass, and yielding a heavy fleece of\r\nexcellent wool. The principal objection made to them was the difficulty\r\nof propagation, which always required the assistance of the shepherd.\r\nThe lambs were dropped white, red, tawny, bluish, or black; but all,\r\nexcepting the black, grew white as they approached maturity, retaining\r\nsome spots of the original color on the cheeks and legs, and sometimes\r\nhaving the entire head tawny or black. The few which descended from the\r\noriginal importations have become blended with American flocks, and have\r\nlong ceased to be distinguishable from them. The common sheep of Holland\r\nwere early imported by the Dutch emigrants, who originally colonized New\r\nYork; but they, in like manner, have long since ceased to exist as a\r\ndistinct variety.\r\n\r\nImproved European breeds have been so largely introduced during the\r\npresent century, that the United States at present possesses every known\r\nbreed which could be of particular benefit to its husbandry. By the\r\ncensus of 1860, there were nearly twenty-three and a half millions of\r\nsheep in this country, yielding upwards of sixty and a half million\r\npounds of wool. An almost infinite variety of crosses have taken place\r\nbetween the Spanish, English, and \"native\" families; carried, indeed, to\r\nsuch an extent that there are, comparatively speaking, few flocks in the\r\nUnited States that preserve entire the distinctive characteristics of\r\nany one breed, or that can lay claim to unmixed purity of blood.\r\n\r\nThe principal breeds in the United States are the so-called \"Natives;\"\r\nthe Spanish and Saxon Merinos, introduced from the countries whose names\r\nthey bear: the New Leicester, or Bakewell; the South-Down; the Cotswold;\r\nthe Cheviot; and the Lincoln--all from England.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIVE SHEEP.\r\n\r\nThis name is popularly applied to the common coarse-woolled sheep of the\r\ncountry, which existed here previously to the importation of the\r\nimproved breeds. These were of foreign and mostly of English origin, and\r\ncould probably claim a common descent from no one stock. The early\r\nsettlers, emigrating from different sections of the British Empire, and\r\na portion of them from other parts of Europe, brought with them, in all\r\nprobability, each the favorite breed of his own immediate neighborhood,\r\nand the admixture of these formed the mongrel family now under\r\nconsideration. Amid the perils of war and the incursions of beasts of\r\nprey, they were carefully preserved. As early as 1676, New England was\r\nspoken of as \"abounding with sheep.\"\r\n\r\nThese common sheep yielded a wool suitable only for the coarsest\r\nfabrics, averaging, in the hands of good farmers, from three to three\r\nand a half pounds of wool to the fleece. They were slow in arriving at\r\nmaturity, compared with the improved English breeds, and yielded, when\r\nfully grown, from ten to fourteen pounds of a middling quality of mutton\r\nto the quarter. They were usually long-legged, light in the\r\nfore-quarter, and narrow on the breast and back; although some rare\r\ninstances might be found of flocks with the short legs, and some\r\napproximation to the general form of the improved breeds. They were\r\nexcellent breeders, often rearing, almost entirely destitute of care,\r\nand without shelter, one hundred per cent. of lambs; and in small\r\nflocks, a still larger proportion. These, too, were usually dropped in\r\nMarch, or the earlier part of April. Restless in their disposition,\r\ntheir impatience of restraint almost equalled that of the untamed\r\nArgali, from which they were descended; and in many sections of the\r\ncountry it was common to see from twenty to fifty of them roving, with\r\nlittle regard to enclosures, over the possessions of their owner and his\r\nneighbors, leaving a large portion of their wool adhering to bushes and\r\nthorns, and the remainder placed nearly beyond the possibility of\r\ncarding, by the tory-weed and burdock, so common on new lands.\r\n\r\nTo this general character of the native flocks, there was but one\r\nexception--a considerably numerous and probably accidental variety,\r\nknown as the _Otter breed_, or _Creepers_. These were excessively\r\nduck-legged, with well-formed bodies, full chests, broad backs, yielding\r\na close, heavy fleece, of medium quality of wool. They were deserved\r\nfavorites where indifferent stone or wood fences existed, since their\r\npower of locomotion was absolutely limited to their enclosures, if\r\nprotected by a fence not less than two feet high. The quality of their\r\nmutton equalled, while their aptitude to fatten was decidedly superior\r\nto, their longer-legged contemporaries. The race is now quite extinct.\r\n\r\nAn excellent variety, called the Arlington sheep, was produced by\r\nGeneral Washington, from a cross of a Persian ram upon the Bakewell,\r\nwhich bore wool fourteen inches in length, soft, silky, and admirably\r\nsuited to combing. These, likewise, have long since become incorporated\r\nwith the other flocks of the country.\r\n\r\nThe old common stock of sheep, as a distinct family, have nearly or\r\nquite disappeared, owing to universal crossing, to a greater or less\r\nextent, with the foreign breeds of later introduction. The first and\r\nsecond cross with the Merino resulted in a decided improvement, and\r\nproduced a variety exceedingly valuable for the farmer who rears wool\r\nsolely for domestic purposes. The fleeces are of uneven fineness, being\r\nhairy on the thighs, dew-lap, etc.; but the general quality is much\r\nimproved, the quantity is considerably augmented, the carcass is more\r\ncompact and nearer the ground, and they have lost their unquiet and\r\nroving propensities. The cross with the Saxon, for reasons hereafter to\r\nbe given, has not generally been so successful. With the Leicester and\r\nDowns, the improvement, so far as form size, and a propensity to take on\r\nfat are concerned, is manifest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH MERINO.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MERINO RAM.]\r\n\r\nThe Spanish sheep, in different countries, has, either directly or\r\nindirectly, effected a complete revolution in the character of the\r\nfleece. The race is unquestionably one of the most ancient extant. The\r\nearly writers on agriculture and the veterinary art describe various\r\nbreeds of sheep as existing in Spain, of different colors--black, red,\r\nand tawny. The black sheep yielded a fine fleece, the finest of that\r\ncolor which was then known; but the red fleece of Baetica--a considerable\r\npart of the Spanish coast on the Mediterranean, comprising the modern\r\nSpanish provinces of Gaen, Cordova, Seville, Andalusia, and Granada,\r\nwhich was early colonized by the enterprising Greeks--was, according to\r\nPliny, of still superior quality, and \"had no fellow.\"\r\n\r\nThese sheep were probably imported from Italy, and of the Tarentine\r\nbreed, which had gradually spread from the coast of Syria, and of the\r\nBlack Sea, and had then reached the western extremity of Europe. Many of\r\nthem mingled with and improved the native breeds of Spain, while others\r\ncontinued to exist as a distinct race, and, meeting with a climate and\r\nan herbage suited to them, retained their original character and value,\r\nand were the progenitors of the Merinos of the present day. Columella, a\r\ncolonist from Italy, and uncle of the writer of an excellent work on\r\nagriculture, introduced more of the Tarentine sheep into Baetica, where\r\nhe resided in the reign of the Emperor Claudius, in the year 41, and\r\notherwise improved on the native breed; for, struck with the beauty of\r\nsome African rams which had been brought to Rome to be exhibited at the\r\npublic games, he purchased them, and conveyed them to his farm in Spain,\r\nwhence, probably, originated the better varieties of the long-woolled\r\nbreeds of that country.\r\n\r\nBefore his time, however, Spain possessed a valuable breed; since\r\nStrabo, who flourished under Tiberius, speaking of the beautiful woollen\r\ncloths that were worn by the Romans, says that the wool was brought from\r\nTruditania, in Spain.\r\n\r\nThe limited region of Italy--overrun, as it repeatedly was, by hordes of\r\nbarbarians during and after the times of the latest emperors--soon lost\r\nher pampered flocks; while the extended regions of Spain--intersected in\r\nevery direction by almost impassable mountains--could maintain their\r\nmore hardy race, in defiance of revolution or change.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the improvements which have been noticed were carried is\r\nunknown; but as Spain was at that time highly civilized, and as\r\nagriculture was the favorite pursuit of the greater part of the\r\ncolonists that spread over the vast territory, which then acknowledged\r\nthe Roman power, it is highly probable that Columella's experiments laid\r\nthe foundation for a general improvement in the Spanish sheep--an\r\nimprovement, moreover, which was not lost, nor even materially impaired,\r\nduring the darker ages that succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe Merino race possess inbred qualities to an extent surpassed by no\r\nothers. They have been improved in the general weight and evenness of\r\ntheir fleece, as in the celebrated flock of Rambouillet; in the\r\nuniformity and excessive fineness of the fibre, as in the Saxons; and in\r\ntheir form and feeding qualities, in various countries; but there has\r\nnever yet been deterioration, either in quantity or quality of fleece or\r\ncarcass, wherever they have been transported, if supplied with suitable\r\nfood and attention. Most sheep annually shed their wool if unclipped;\r\nwhile the Merino retains its fleece, sometimes for five years, when\r\nallowed to remain unshorn.\r\n\r\nConclusive evidence is thus afforded of continued breeding among\r\nthemselves, by which the very constitution of the wool-producing organs\r\nbeneath the skin have become permanently established; and this property\r\nis transmitted to a great extent, even among the crosses, thus marking\r\nthe Merino as an ancient and peculiar race.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the ancient varieties of color, also, as noticed by\r\nPliny, Solinus, and Columella, may still be discovered in the modern\r\nMerino. The plain and indeed the only reason that can be assigned for\r\nthe union of black and gray faces with white bodies, in the same breed,\r\nis the frequent intermixture of black and white sheep, until the white\r\nprevails in the fleece, and the black is confined to the face and legs.\r\nIt is still apt to break out occasionally in the individual, unless it\r\nis fixed and concentrated in the face and legs, by repeated crosses and\r\na careful selection; and, on the contrary, in the Merino South-Down the\r\nblack may be reduced by a few crosses to small spots about the legs,\r\nwhile the Merino hue overspreads the countenance. This hue--variously\r\ndescribed as a velvet, a buff, a fawn, or a satin-colored countenance,\r\nbut in which a red tinge not infrequently predominates, still indicates\r\nthe original colors of the indigenous breeds of Spain; and the black\r\nwool, for which Spain was formerly so much distinguished, is still\r\ninclined to break out occasionally in the legs and ears of the Merino.\r\nIn some flocks half the ear is invariably brown, and a coarse black hair\r\nis often discernible in the finest pile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SPANISH SHEEP DOG.]\r\n\r\nThe conquest, in the eighth century, by the Moors of those fine\r\nprovinces in the south of Spain, so far from checking, served rather to\r\nencourage the production of fine wool. The conquerors were not only\r\nenterprising, but highly skilled in the useful arts, and carried on\r\nextensive manufactories of fine woollen goods, which they exported to\r\ndifferent countries. The luxury of the Moorish sovereigns has been the\r\ntheme of many writers; and in the thirteenth century, when the woollen\r\nmanufacture flourished in but few places, there were found in Seville no\r\nless than sixteen thousand looms. A century later, Barcelona, Perpignan,\r\nand Tortosa were celebrated for the fineness of their cloths, which\r\nbecame staple articles of trade throughout the greater part of Europe,\r\nas well as on the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nAfter the expulsion of the Moors, in the fifteenth century, by\r\nFerdinand and Isabella, the woollen manufacture languished, and was, in\r\na great degree, lost to Spain, owing to the rigorous banishment of\r\nnearly one million industrious Moors, most of whom were weavers. As a\r\nconsequence, the sixteen thousand looms of Seville dwindled down to\r\nsixty. The Spanish government perceived its fatal mistake too late, and\r\nsubsequent efforts to gain its lost vantage-ground in respect to this\r\nmanufacture proved fruitless. During all that time, however, the Spanish\r\nsheep appear to have withstood the baneful influence of almost total\r\nneglect; and although the Merino flocks and Merino wool have improved\r\nunder the more careful management of other countries, the world is\r\noriginally indebted to Spain for the most valuable material in the\r\nmanufacture of cloth.\r\n\r\nThe perpetuation of the Merino sheep in all its purity, amid the\r\nconvulsions which changed the entire political framework of Spain and\r\ndestroyed every other national improvement, strikingly illustrates the\r\nprimary determining power of blood or breeding, as well as the agency of\r\nsoil and climate--possibly too much underrated in modern times.\r\n\r\nThese Spanish sheep are divided into two classes: the _stationary_, or\r\nthose that remain during the whole of the year on a certain farm, or in\r\na certain district, there being a sufficient provision for them in\r\nwinter and in summer; and the _migratory_, or those which wander some\r\nhundreds of miles twice in the year, in quest of pasturage. The\r\nprincipal breed of stationary sheep consists of true Merinos; but the\r\nbreeds most sought for, and with which so many countries have been\r\nenriched, are the Merinos of the migratory description, which pass the\r\nsummer in the mountains of the north, and the winter on the plains\r\ntoward the south of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe first impression made by the Merino sheep on one unacquainted with\r\nits value would be unfavorable. The wool lying closer and thicker over\r\nthe body than in most other breeds, and being abundant in yolk--or a\r\npeculiar secretion from the glands of the skin, which nourishes the wool\r\nand causes it to mat closely together--is covered with a dirty crust,\r\noften full of cracks. The legs are long, yet small in the bone; the\r\nbreast and the back are narrow, and the sides somewhat flat; the\r\nfore-shoulders and bosoms are heavy, and too much of their weight is\r\ncarried on the coarser parts. The horns of the male are comparatively\r\nlarge, curved, and with more or less of a spiral form; the head is\r\nlarge, but the forehead rather low. A few of the females are horned;\r\nbut, generally speaking, they are without horns. Both male and female\r\nhave a peculiar coarse and unsightly growth of hair on the forehead and\r\ncheeks, which the careful shepherd cuts away before the shearing-time;\r\nthe other part of the face has a pleasing and characteristic velvet\r\nappearance. Under the throat there is a singular looseness of skin,\r\nwhich gives them a remarkable appearance of throatiness, or hollowness\r\nin the neck. The pile or hair, when pressed upon, is hard and\r\nunyielding, owing to the thickness into which it grows on the pelf, and\r\nthe abundance of the yolk, retaining all the dirt and gravel which falls\r\nupon it; but, upon examination, the fibre exceeds, in fineness and in\r\nthe number of serrations and curves, that which any other sheep in the\r\nworld produces. The average weight of the fleece in Spain is eight\r\npounds from the ram, and five from the ewe. The staple differs in length\r\nin different provinces. When fatted, these sheep will weigh from twelve\r\nto sixteen pounds per quarter.\r\n\r\nThe excellence of the Merinos consist in the unexampled fineness and\r\nfelting property of their wool, and in the weight of it yielded by each\r\nindividual sheep; the closeness of that wool, and the luxuriance of the\r\nyolk, which enable them to support extremes of cold and wet quite as\r\nwell as any other breed; the readiness with which they adapt themselves\r\nto every change of climate, retaining, with common care, all their\r\nfineness of wool, and thriving under a burning tropical sun, and in the\r\nfrozen regions of the north; an appetite which renders them apparently\r\nsatisfied with the coarsest food; a quietness and patience into whatever\r\npasture they are turned; and a gentleness and tractableness not excelled\r\nin any other breed.\r\n\r\nTheir defects--partly attributable to the breed, but more to\r\nthe improper mode of treatment to which they are occasionally\r\nsubjected--are, their unthrifty and unprofitable form; a tendency to\r\nabortion, or barrenness; a difficulty of yeaning, or giving birth to\r\ntheir young; a paucity of milk; and a too frequent neglect of their\r\nlambs. They are likewise said, notwithstanding the fineness of their\r\nwool, and the beautiful red color of the skin when the fleece is parted,\r\nto be more subject to cutaneous affections than most other breeds. Man,\r\nhowever, is far more responsible for this than Nature. Every thing was\r\nsacrificed in Spain to fineness and quantity of wool. These were\r\nsupposed to be connected with equality of temperature, or, at least,\r\nwith freedom from exposure to cold; and, therefore, twice in the year, a\r\njourney of four hundred miles was undertaken, at the rate of eighty or a\r\nhundred miles per week--the spring journey commencing when the lambs\r\nwere scarcely four months old. It is difficult to say in what way the\r\nwool of the migratory sheep was, or could be, benefited by these\r\nperiodical journeys. Although among them is found the finest and most\r\nvaluable wool in Spain, yet the stationary sheep, in certain\r\nprovinces--Segovia, Leon, and Estremadura--are more valuable than the\r\nmigratory flocks of others. Moreover, the fleece of some of the German\r\nMerinos--which do not travel at all, and are housed all the\r\nwinter--greatly exceeds that obtained from the best migratory breed--the\r\nLeonese--in fineness and felting property; and the wool of the migratory\r\nsheep has been, comparatively speaking, driven out of the market by that\r\nfrom sheep which never travel. With respect to the carcass, these\r\nharassing journeys, occupying one-quarter of the year, tend to destroy\r\nall possibility of fattening, or any tendency toward it, and the form\r\nand the constitution of the flock are deteriorated, and the lives of\r\nmany sacrificed.\r\n\r\nThe first importation of Merinos into the United States took place in\r\n1801; a banker of Paris, Mr. Delessert, having shipped four, of which\r\nbut one arrived in safety at his farm near Kingston, in New York; the\r\nothers perished on the passage. The same year, Mr. Seth Adams, of\r\nMassachusetts, imported a pair from France. In 1802, Chancellor\r\nLivingston, then American Minister at the court of Versailles, sent two\r\nchoice pairs from the Rambouillet flock--which was started, in 1786, by\r\nplacing four hundred ewes and rams, selected from the choicest Spanish\r\nflocks, on the royal farm of that name, in France--to Claremont, his\r\ncountry-seat, on the Hudson river. In the latter part of the same year,\r\nColonel Humphreys, American Minister to Spain, shipped two hundred, on\r\nhis departure from that country. The largest importations, however, were\r\nmade through Hon. William Jarvis, of Vermont, then American Consul at\r\nLisbon, Portugal, in 1809, 1810, and 1811, who succeeded in obtaining\r\nthe choicest sheep of that country. Various subsequent importations took\r\nplace, which need not be particularized.\r\n\r\nThe cessation of all commercial intercourse with England, in 1808 and\r\n1809, growing out of difficulties with that country, directed attention,\r\nin an especial manner, toward manufacturing and wool-growing. The\r\nMerino, consequently, rose into importance, and so great was the\r\ninterest aroused, that from a thousand to fourteen hundred dollars a\r\nhead was paid for them. Some of the later importations, unfortunately,\r\narrived in the worst condition, bringing with them those scourges of the\r\nsheep family, the scab and the foot-rot; which evils, together with\r\nincreased supply, soon brought them down to less than a twentieth part\r\nof their former price. When, however, it was established, by actual\r\nexperiment, that their wool did not deteriorate in this country, as had\r\nbeen feared by many, and that they became readily acclimated, they again\r\nrose into favor. The prostration of the manufacturing interests of the\r\ncountry, which ensued soon afterwards, rendered the Merino of\r\ncomparatively little value, and ruined many who had purchased them at\r\ntheir previous high prices. Since that period, the valuation of the\r\nsheep which bear the particular wool has, as a matter of course, kept\r\npace with the fluctuations in the price of the wool.\r\n\r\nThe term Merino, it must be remembered, is but the general appellation\r\nof a breed, comprising several varieties, presenting essential points of\r\ndifference in size, form, quality and quantity of wool. These families\r\nhave generally been merged, by interbreeding, in the United States and\r\nother countries which have received the race from Spain. Purity of\r\n_Merino_ blood, and actual excellence in the individual and its\r\nancestors, form the only standard in selecting sheep of this breed.\r\nFamilies have, indeed, sprung up in this country, exhibiting wider\r\npoints of difference than did those of Spain. This is owing, in some\r\ncases, doubtless, to particular causes of breeding; but more often,\r\nprobably, to concealed or forgotten infusions of other blood. The\r\nquestion, which has been at times raised, whether there are any Merinos\r\nin the United States, descendants of the early importations, of\r\nunquestionable purity of blood, has been conclusively settled in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nThe minor distinctions among the various families into which, as has\r\nalready been intimated, the American Merino has diverged, are numerous,\r\nbut may all, perhaps, be classed under three general heads.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ is a large, short-legged, strong, exceedingly hardy sheep,\r\ncarrying a heavy fleece, ranging from medium to fine, free from hair in\r\nproperly bred flocks; somewhat inclined to throatiness, but not so much\r\nso as the Rambouillets; bred to exhibit external concrete gum in some\r\nflocks, but not commonly so; their wool rather long on back and belly,\r\nand exceedingly dense; wool whiter within than the Rambouillets; skin\r\nthe same rich rose-color. Sheep of this class are larger and stronger\r\nthan those originally imported, carry much heavier fleeces, and in\r\nwell-selected flocks, or individuals, the fleece is of a decidedly\r\nbetter quality.\r\n\r\nThe _second_ class embraces smaller animals than the preceding; less\r\nhardy; wool, as a general thing, finer, and covered with a black, pitchy\r\ngum on its extremities; fleece about one-fourth lighter than in the\r\nformer class.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ class, bred at the South, mostly, includes animals still\r\nsmaller and less hardy, and carrying still finer and lighter fleeces.\r\nThe fleece is destitute of external gum. The sheep and wool have a close\r\nresemblance to the Saxon; and, if not actually mixed with that blood,\r\nthey have been formed into a similar variety, by a similar course of\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUT AT PASTURE.]\r\n\r\nThe mutton of the Merino, notwithstanding the prejudices existing on the\r\nsubject, is short-grained, and of good flavor, when killed at a proper\r\nage, and weighs from ten to fourteen pounds to the quarter. It is\r\nremarkable for its longevity, retaining its teeth, and continuing to\r\nbreed two or three years longer than the common sheep, and at least half\r\na dozen years longer than the improved English breeds. It should,\r\nhowever, be remarked, in this connection, that it is correspondingly\r\nslow in arriving at maturity, as it does not attain its full growth\r\nbefore three years of age; and the ewes, in the best managed flocks, are\r\nrarely permitted to breed before they reach that age.\r\n\r\nThe Merino is a far better breeder than any other fine-woolled sheep,\r\nand its lambs, when newly dropped, are claimed to be hardier than the\r\nBakewell, and equally so with the high-bred South-Down. The ewe, as has\r\nbeen intimated, is not so good a nurse, and will not usually do full\r\njustice to more than one lamb. Eighty or ninety per cent. is about the\r\nordinary number of lambs reared, though it often reaches one hundred per\r\ncent., in carefully managed or small flocks.\r\n\r\nAllusion has heretofore been made to the cross between the Merino and\r\nthe native sheep. On the introduction of the Saxon family of the\r\nMerinos, they were universally engrafted on the parent stock, and the\r\ncross was continued until the Spanish blood was nearly bred out. When\r\nthe admixture took place with judiciously selected Saxons, the results\r\nwere not unfavorable for certain purposes. These instances of judicious\r\ncrossing were, unfortunately, rare. Fineness of wool was made the only\r\ntests of excellence, no matter how scanty its quantity, or how\r\ndiminutive or miserable the carcass. The consequence was, as might be\r\nsupposed, the ruin of most of the Merino flocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SAXON MERINO.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous breed of sheep in Saxony resembled that of the\r\nneighboring states, and consisted of two distinct Varieties--one bearing\r\na wool of some value, and the other yielding a fleece applicable only to\r\nthe coarsest manufactures.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the seven years war, Augustus Frederic, the Elector of\r\nSaxony, imported one hundred rams and two hundred ewes from the most\r\nimproved Spanish flocks, and placed a part of them on one of his own\r\nfarms, in the neighborhood of Dresden, which he kept unmixed, as he\r\ndesired to ascertain how far the pure Spanish breed could be naturalized\r\nin that country The other part of the flock was distributed on other\r\nfarms, and devoted to the improvement of the Saxon sheep.\r\n\r\nIt was soon sufficiently apparent that the Merinos did not degenerate in\r\nSaxony. Many parcels of their wool were not inferior to the choicest\r\nLeonese fleeces. The best breed of the native Saxons was also materially\r\nimproved: The majority of the shepherds were, however, obstinately\r\nprejudiced against the innovation; but the elector, resolutely bent upon\r\naccomplishing his object, imported an additional number, and compelled\r\nthe crown-tenants, then occupying lands under him, to purchase a certain\r\nnumber of the sheep.\r\n\r\nCompulsion was not long necessary; the true interest of the shepherds\r\nwas discovered; pure Merinos rapidly increased in Saxony, and became\r\nperfectly naturalized. Indeed, after a considerable lapse of years, the\r\nfleece of the Saxon sheep began, not only to equal the Spanish, but to\r\nexceed it in fineness and manufacturing value. To this result the\r\ngovernment very materially contributed, by the establishment of an\r\nagricultural school, and other minor schools for shepherds, and by\r\ndistributing various publications, which plainly and intelligibly showed\r\nthe value and proper management of the Merino. The breeders were\r\nselected with almost exclusive reference to the quality of the fleece.\r\nGreat care was taken to prevent exposure throughout the year, and they\r\nwere housed on every slight emergency. By this course of breeding and\r\ntreatment the size and weight of the fleece were reduced, and that\r\nhardiness and vigor of constitution, which had universally\r\ncharacterized the migratory Spanish breed, were partially impaired. In\r\nnumerous instances, this management resulted in permanent injury to the\r\ncharacter of the flocks.\r\n\r\nThe first importation of Saxons into this country was made in 1823, by\r\nSamuel Heustan, a merchant of Boston, Massachusetts, and consisted of\r\nfour good rams, of which two went to Boston, and the others to\r\nPhiladelphia. The following year, seventy-seven--about two-thirds of\r\nwhich number only were pure-blooded--were brought to Boston, sold at\r\npublic auction at Brooklyn, N.Y., as \"pure-blooded electoral Saxons,\"\r\nand thus scattered over the country. Another lot, composed of grade\r\nsheep and pure-bloods, was disposed of, not long afterwards, by public\r\nsale, at Brighton, near Boston, and brought increased prices, some of\r\nthem realizing from four hundred to five hundred and fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nThese prices gave rise to speculation, and many animals, of a decidedly\r\ninferior grade, were imported, which were thrown upon the market for the\r\nmost they could command. The sales in many instances not half covering\r\nthe cost of importation, the speculation was soon abandoned. In 1827,\r\nHenry D. Grove, of Hoosic, N.Y., a native of Germany, and a highly\r\nintelligent and thoroughly bred shepherd, who had accompanied some of\r\nthe early importations, imported one hundred and fifteen choice animals\r\nfor his own breeding, and, in the following year, eighty more. These\r\nformed the flock from which Mr. Grove bred, to the time of his decease,\r\nin 1844. The average weight of fleece from his entire flock, nearly all\r\nof which were ewes and lambs, was ten pounds and fourteen ounces,\r\nthoroughly washed on the sheep's back. This was realized after a short\r\nsummer and winter's keep, when the quantity of hay or its equivalent\r\nfed to the sheep did not exceed one and a half pounds, by actual weight,\r\nper day, except to the ewes, which received an additional quantity just\r\nbefore and after lambing. This treatment was attended with no disease or\r\nloss by death, and with an increase of lambs, equalling one for every\r\newe.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon Merino differs materially in frame from the Spanish; there is\r\nmore roundness of carcass and fineness of bone, together with a general\r\nform and appearance indicative of a disposition to fatten. Two distinct\r\nbreeds are noticed. One variety has stouter legs, stouter bodies, head\r\nand neck comparatively short and broad, and body round; the wool grows\r\nmost on the face and legs; the grease in the wool is almost pitchy. The\r\nother breed, called Escurial, has longer legs, with a long, spare neck\r\nand head; very little wool on the latter; and a finer, shorter, and\r\nsofter character in its fleece, but less in quantity.\r\n\r\nFrom what has just been stated it will be seen that there are few Saxon\r\nflocks in the United States that have not been reduced to the quality of\r\ngrade sheep, by the promiscuous admixture of the pure and the impure\r\nwhich were imported together; all of them being sold to our breeders as\r\npure stock. Besides, there are very few flocks which have not been again\r\ncrossed with the Native or the Merino sheep of our country, or with\r\nboth. Those who early purchased the Merino crossed them with the Native;\r\nand when the Saxons arrived those mongrels were bred to Saxon rams. This\r\nis the history of three-quarters, probably, of the Saxon flocks of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAs these sheep have now so long been bred toward the Saxon that their\r\nwool equals that of the pure-bloods, it may well be questioned whether\r\nthey are any worse for the admixture; when crossed only with the Merino,\r\nit is, undoubtedly, to their advantage. The American Saxon, with these\r\nearly crosses in its pedigree, is, by general admission, a hardier and\r\nmore easily kept animal than the pure Escurial or Electoral Saxon.\r\nClimate, feed, and other causes have, doubtless, conspired, as in the\r\ncase of the Merino, to add to their size and vigor; but, after every\r\nnecessary allowance has been made, they generally owe these qualities to\r\nthose early crosses.\r\n\r\nThe fleeces of the American Saxons weigh, on the average, from two or\r\ntwo and a quarter to three pounds. They are, comparatively speaking, a\r\ntender sheep, requiring regular supplies of good food, good shelter in\r\nwinter, and protection in cool weather from storms of all kinds; but\r\nthey are evidently hardier than the parent German stock. In docility and\r\npatience under confinement, in late maturity and longevity, they\r\nresemble the Merinos, from which they are descended; though they do not\r\nmature so early as the Merino, nor do they ordinarily live so long. They\r\nare poorer nurses; their lambs are smaller, fatter, and far more likely\r\nto perish, unless sheltered and carefully watched; they do not fatten so\r\nwell, and, being considerably lighter, they consume an amount of food\r\nconsiderably less.\r\n\r\nTaken together, the American Saxons bear a much finer wool than the\r\nAmerican Merinos; though this is not always the case, and many breeders\r\nof Saxons cross with the Merino, for the purpose of increasing the\r\nweight of their fleeces without deteriorating its quality. Our Saxon\r\nwool, as a whole, falls considerably below that of Germany; though\r\nindividual specimens from Saxons in Connecticut and Ohio compare well\r\nwith the highest German grades. This inferiority is not attributable to\r\nclimate or other natural causes, or to a want of skill on the part of\r\nour breeders; but to the fact that but a very few of our manufacturers\r\nhave ever felt willing to make that discrimination in prices which would\r\nrender it profitable to breed those small and delicate animals which\r\nproduce this exquisite quality of wool.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW LEICESTER.\r\n\r\nThe unimproved Leicester was a large, heavy, coarse-woolled breed of\r\nsheep, inhabiting the midland counties of England. It was a slow feeder,\r\nits flesh coarse-grained, and with little flavor. The breeders of that\r\nperiod regarded only size and weight of fleece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COUNTRY SCENE.]\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the last century, Robert Bakewell, of Dishley, in\r\nLeicestershire, first applied himself to the improvement of the sheep in\r\nthat country. Before his improvements, aptitude to fatten and symmetry\r\nof shape--that is, such shape as should increase as much as possible the\r\nmost valuable parts of the animal, and diminish the offal in the same\r\nproportion--were entirely disregarded. Perceiving that smaller animals\r\nincreased in weight more rapidly than the very large ones, that they\r\nconsumed less food, that the same quantity of herbage, applied to\r\nfeeding a large number of small sheep, would produce more meat than when\r\napplied to feeding the smaller number of large sheep, which alone it\r\nwould support, and that sheep carrying a heavy fleece of wool possessed\r\nless propensity to fatten than those which carried one of a more\r\nmoderate weight, he selected from the different flocks in his\r\nneighborhood, without regard to size, the sheep which appeared to him to\r\nhave the greatest propensity to fatten, and whose shape possessed the\r\npeculiarities which, in his judgment, would produce the largest\r\nproportion of valuable meat, and the smallest quantity of bone and\r\noffal.\r\n\r\nHe was also of opinion that the first object to be attended to in\r\nbreeding sheep is the value of the carcass, and that the fleece ought\r\nalways to be a secondary consideration; and this for the obvious reason\r\nthat, while the addition of two or three pounds of wool to the weight of\r\na sheep's fleece is a difference of great amount, yet if this increase\r\nis obtained at the expense of the animal's propensity to fatten, the\r\nfarmer may lose by it ten or twelve pounds of mutton.\r\n\r\nThe sort of sheep, therefore, which he selected were those possessed of\r\nthe most perfect symmetry, with the greatest aptitude to fatten, and\r\nrather smaller in size than the sheep generally bred at that time.\r\nHaving formed his stock from sheep so selected, he carefully attended to\r\nthe peculiarities of the individuals from which he bred, and, so far as\r\ncan be ascertained--for all of Mr. Bakewell's measures were kept\r\nsecret, even from his most intimate friends, and he died without\r\nthrowing, voluntarily, the least light on the subject--did not object to\r\nbreeding from near relations, when, by so doing, he brought together\r\nanimals likely to produce a progeny possessing the characteristics which\r\nhe wished to obtain.\r\n\r\nHaving thus established his flock, he adopted the practice--which has\r\nsince been constantly followed by the most eminent breeders of sheep--of\r\nletting rams for the season, instead of selling them to those who wished\r\nfor their use. By this means the ram-breeder is enabled to keep a much\r\nlarger number of rams in his possession; and, consequently, his power of\r\nselecting those most suitable to his flock, or which may be required to\r\ncorrect any faults in shape or quality which may occur in it, is greatly\r\nincreased. By cautiously using a ram for one season, or by observing the\r\nproduce of a ram let to some other breeder, he can ascertain the\r\nprobable qualities of the lambs which such ram will get, and thus avoid\r\nthe danger of making mistakes which would deteriorate the value of his\r\nstock. The farmers, likewise, who hire the rams, have an opportunity of\r\nvarying the rams from which they breed much more than they otherwise\r\ncould do; and they are also enabled to select from sheep of the best\r\nquality, and from those best calculated to effect the greatest\r\nimprovement in their flocks.\r\n\r\nThe idea, when first introduced by him, was so novel that he had great\r\ndifficulty in inducing the farmers to act upon it; and his first ram was\r\nlet for sixteen shillings. So eminent, however, was his success, that,\r\nin 1787, he let three rams, for a single season, for twelve hundred and\r\nfifty pounds (about six thousand two hundred dollars), and was offered\r\nten hundred and fifty pounds (about five thousand two hundred dollars)\r\nfor twenty ewes. Soon afterwards he received the enormous price of eight\r\nhundred guineas (or four thousand dollars) for two-thirds of the\r\nservices of a ram for a single season, reserving the other third for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe improved Leicester is of large size, but somewhat smaller than the\r\noriginal stock, and in this respect falls considerably below the coarser\r\nvarieties of Cotswold, Lincoln, etc. Where there is a sufficiency of\r\nfeed, the New Leicester is unrivalled for its fattening propensities;\r\nbut it will not bear hard stocking, nor must it be compelled to travel\r\nfar in search of its food. It is, in fact, properly and exclusively a\r\nlowland sheep. In its appropriate situation--on the luxuriant herbage of\r\nthe highly cultivated lands of England--it possesses unequalled\r\nearliness of maturity; and its mutton, when not too fat, is of a good\r\nquality, but is usually coarse, and comparatively deficient in flavor,\r\nowing to that unnatural state of fatness which it so readily assumes,\r\nand which the breeder, to gain weight, so generally feeds for. The\r\nwethers, having reached their second year, are turned off in the\r\nsucceeding February or March, and weigh at that age from thirty to\r\nthirty-five pounds to the quarter. The wool of the New Leicester is\r\nlong, averaging, after the first shearing, about six inches; and the\r\nfleece of the American animal weighs about six pounds. It is of coarse\r\nquality, and little used in the manufacture of cloth, on account of its\r\nlength, and that deficiency of felting properties common, in a greater\r\nor less extent, to all English breeds. As a combing wool, however, it\r\nstands first, and is used in the manufacture of the finest worsteds, and\r\nthe like textures.\r\n\r\nThe high-bred Leicesters of Mr. Bakewell's stock became shy breeders\r\nand poor nurses; but crosses subsequently adopted have, to some extent,\r\nobviated these defects. The lambs are not, however, generally regarded\r\nas very hardy, and they require considerable attention at the time of\r\nyeaning, particularly if the weather is even moderately cold or stormy.\r\nThe grown sheep, too, are much affected by sudden changes in the\r\nweather; an abrupt change to cold being pretty certain to be registered\r\non their noses by unmistakable indications of catarrh or \"snuffles.\"\r\n\r\nIn England, where mutton is generally eaten by the laboring classes, the\r\nmeat of this variety is in very great demand; and the consequent return\r\nwhich a sheep possessing such fine feeding qualities is enabled to make\r\nrenders it a general favorite with the breeder. Instances are recorded\r\nof the most extraordinary prices having been paid for these animals.\r\nThey have spread into all parts of the British dominions, and been\r\nimported into the other countries of Europe and into the United States.\r\n\r\nThey were first introduced into our own country, some forty years since,\r\nby Christopher Dunn, of Albany, N.Y. Subsequent importations have been\r\nmade by Mr. Powel, of Philadelphia, and various other gentlemen. The\r\nbreed, however, has never proved a favorite with any large class of\r\nAmerican farmers. Our long, cold winters--but, more especially, our dry,\r\nscorching summers, when it is often difficult to obtain the rich, green,\r\ntender feed in which the Leicester delights--together with the general\r\ndeprivation of green feed in the winter, rob it of its early maturity,\r\nand even of the ultimate size which it attains in England. Its mutton is\r\ntoo fat, and the fat and lean are too little intermixed to suit\r\nAmerican taste. Its wool is not very salable, owing to the dearth of\r\nworsted manufactures in our country. Its early decay and loss of wool\r\nconstitute an objection to it, in a country where it is often so\r\ndifficult to advantageously turn off sheep, particularly ewes. But,\r\nnotwithstanding all these disadvantages, on rich lowland farms, in the\r\nvicinity of considerable markets, it will always in all probability make\r\na profitable return.\r\n\r\nThe head of the New Leicester should be hornless, long, small, tapering\r\ntowards the muzzle, and projecting horizontally forward; the eyes\r\nprominent, but with a quiet expression; the ears thin, rather long, and\r\ndirected backward; the neck full and broad at its base, where it\r\nproceeds from the chest, so that there is, with the slightest possible\r\ndeviation, one continued horizontal line from the rump to the poll; the\r\nbreast broad and full; the shoulders also broad and round, and no uneven\r\nor angular formation where the shoulders join either the neck or the\r\nback--particularly no rising of the withers, or hollow behind the\r\nsituation of these bones; the arm fleshy throughout its whole extent,\r\nand even down to the knee; the bones of the leg small, standing wide\r\napart; no looseness of skin about them, and comparatively void of wool;\r\nthe chest and barrel at once deep and round; the ribs forming a\r\nconsiderable arch from the spine, so as, in some cases--and especially\r\nwhen the animal is in good condition--to make the apparent width of the\r\nchest even greater than the depth; the barrel ribbed well home; no\r\nirregularity of line on the back or belly, but on the sides; the carcass\r\nvery gradually diminishing in width towards the rump; the quarters long\r\nand full, and, as with the fore-legs, the muscles extending down to the\r\nhock; the thighs also wide and full; the legs of a moderate length; and\r\nthe pelt also moderately thin, but soft and elastic, and covered with a\r\ngood quantity of white wool, not so long as in some breeds, but\r\nconsiderably finer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH-DOWN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SOUTH-DOWN RAM.]\r\n\r\nA long range of chalky hills, diverging from the chalky stratum which\r\nintersects England from Norfolk to Dorchester, is termed the\r\nSouth-Downs. They enter the county of Sussex on the west side, and are\r\ncontinued almost in a direct line, as far as East Bourne, where they\r\nreach the sea. They may be regarded as occupying a space of more than\r\nsixty miles in length, and about five or six in breadth, consisting of a\r\nsuccession of open downs, with few enclosures, and distinguished by\r\ntheir situation and name from a more northern tract of similar elevation\r\nand soil, passing through Surrey and Kent, and terminating in the cliffs\r\nof Dover, and of the Forelands. On these downs a certain breed of sheep\r\nhas been produced for many centuries, in greater perfection than\r\nelsewhere; and hence have sprung those successive colonies which have\r\nfound their way abroad and materially benefited the breed of\r\nshort-woolled sheep wherever they have gone.\r\n\r\nIt is only, however, within a comparatively recent period that they have\r\nbeen brought to their present perfection. As recently as 1776 they were\r\nsmall in size, and of a form not superior to the common woolled sheep of\r\nthe United States; they were far from possessing a good shape, being\r\nlong and thin in the neck, high on the shoulders, low behind, high on\r\nthe loins, down on the rump, the tail set on very low, perpendicular\r\nfrom the hip-bones, sharp on the back; the ribs flat, not bowing, narrow\r\nin the fore-quarters, but good in the leg, although having big bones.\r\nSince that period a course of judicious breeding, pursued by Mr. John\r\nEllman, of Glynde, in Sussex, has mainly contributed to raise this\r\nvariety to its present value; and that, too, without the admixture of\r\nthe slightest degree of foreign blood.\r\n\r\nThis pure, improved family, it will be borne in mind, is spoken of in\r\nthe present connection; inasmuch as the original stock, presenting, with\r\ntrifling modifications, the same characteristics which they exhibited\r\nseventy-five years ago, are yet to be found in England; and the\r\nintermediate space between these two classes is occupied by a variety of\r\ngrades, rising or falling in value, as they approximate to or recede\r\nfrom the improved blood.\r\n\r\nThe South-Down sheep are polled, but it is probable that the original\r\nbreed was horned, as it is not unusual to find among the male South-Down\r\nlambs some with small horns. The dusky, or at times, black hue of the\r\nhead and legs fully establishes the original color of the sheep, and,\r\nperhaps of all sheep; while the later period at which it was seriously\r\nattempted to get rid of this dingy hue proving unsuccessful, only\r\nconfirms this view. Many of the lambs have been dropped entirely black.\r\n\r\nIt is an upland sheep, of medium size, and its wool--which in point of\r\nlength belongs to the middle class, and differs essentially from Merino\r\nwool of any grade, though the fibre in some of the finest fleeces maybe\r\nof the same apparent fineness with half or one-quarter blood Merino--is\r\ndeficient in felting properties, making a fuzzy, hairy cloth, and is no\r\nlonger used in England, unless largely mixed with foreign wool, even for\r\nthe lowest class of cloths. As it has deteriorated, however, it has\r\nincreased in length of staple, in that country, to such an extent that\r\nimproved machinery enables it to be used as a combing-wool, for the\r\nmanufacture of worsteds. Where this has taken place it is quite as\r\nprofitable as when it was finer and shorter. In the United States, where\r\nthe demand for combing-wool is so small that it is easily met by a\r\nbetter article, the same result would not probably follow. Indeed, it\r\nmay well be doubted whether the proper combing length will be easily\r\nreached, or at least maintained in this country, in the absence of that\r\nhigh feeding system which has undoubtedly given the wool its increased\r\nlength in England. The average weight of fleece in the hill-fed sheep is\r\nthree pounds; on rich lowlands, a little more.\r\n\r\nThe South-Down, however, is cultivated more particularly for its mutton,\r\nwhich for quality takes precedence of all other--from sheep of good\r\nsize--in the English markets. Its early maturity and extreme aptitude to\r\nlay on flesh, render it peculiarly valuable for this purpose. It is\r\nturned off at the age of two years, and its weight at that age is, in\r\nEngland, from eighty to one hundred pounds. High-fed wethers have\r\nreached from thirty-two to even forty pounds a quarter. Notwithstanding\r\nits weight, it has a patience of occasional short keep, and an\r\nendurance of hard stocking, equal to any other sheep. This gives it a\r\ndecided advantage over the bulkier Leicesters and Lincolns, as a mutton\r\nsheep, in hilly districts and those producing short and scanty herbage.\r\nIt is hardy and healthy, though, in common with the other English\r\nvarieties, much subject to catarrh, and no sheep better withstands our\r\nAmerican winters. The ewes are prolific breeders and good nurses.\r\n\r\nThe Down is quiet and docile in its habits, and, though an industrious\r\nfeeder, exhibits but little disposition to rove. Like the Leicester, it\r\nis comparatively a short-lived animal, and the fleece continues to\r\ndecrease in weight after it reaches maturity. It crosses better with\r\nshort and middle-woolled breeds than the Leicester. A sheep possessing\r\nsuch qualities, must, of necessity, be valuable in upland districts in\r\nthe vicinity of markets. The Emperor of Russia paid Mr. Ellman three\r\nhundred guineas (fifteen hundred dollars) for two rams; and, in 1800, a\r\nram belonging to the Duke of Bedford was let for one season at eighty\r\nguineas (four hundred dollars), two others at forty guineas (two hundred\r\ndollars) each, and four more at twenty-eight guineas (one hundred and\r\nforty dollars) each. The first importation into the United States was\r\nmade by Col. J. H. Powell, of Philadelphia. A subsequent importation, in\r\n1834, cost sixty dollars a head.\r\n\r\nThe desirable characteristics of the South-Down may be thus summed up:\r\nThe head small and hornless; the face speckled or gray, and neither too\r\nlong nor too short; the lips thin, and the space between the nose and\r\nthe eyes narrow; the under-jaw or chap fine and thin; the ears tolerably\r\nwide and well-covered with wool, and the forehead also, and the whole\r\nspace between the ears well protected by it, as a defence against the\r\nfly; the eye full and bright, but not prominent; the orbits of the eye,\r\nthe eye-cap or bone not too projecting, that it may not form a fatal\r\nobstacle in lambing; the neck of a medium length, thin toward the head,\r\nbut enlarging toward the shoulders, where it should be broad and high\r\nand straight in its whole course above and below.\r\n\r\nThe breast should be wide, deep, and projecting forward between the\r\nfore-legs, indicating a good constitution and a disposition to thrive;\r\ncorresponding with this, the shoulders should be on a level with the\r\nback, and not too wide above; they should bow outward from the top to\r\nthe breast, indicating a springing rib beneath, and leaving room for it;\r\nthe ribs coming out horizontally from the spine, and extending far\r\nbackward, and the last rib projecting more than others; the back flat\r\nfrom the shoulders to the setting on of the tail; the loin broad and\r\nflat; the rump broad, and the tail set on high, and nearly on a level\r\nwith the spine.\r\n\r\nThe hips should be wide; the space between them and the last rib on each\r\nside as narrow as possible, and the ribs generally presenting a circular\r\nform like a barrel; the belly as straight as the back; the legs neither\r\ntoo long nor too short; the fore-legs straight from the breast to the\r\nfoot, not bending inward at the knee, and standing far apart, both\r\nbefore and behind; the hock having a direction rather outward, and they\r\ntwist, or the meeting of the thighs behind, being particularly full; the\r\nbones fine, yet having no appearance of weakness, and of a speckled or\r\ndark color; the belly well defended with wool, and the wool coming down\r\nbefore and behind to the knee and to the hock; the wool short, close,\r\ncurled and fine, and free from spiny projecting fibres.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COTSWOLD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COTSWOLD.]\r\n\r\nThe Cotswolds, until improved by modern crosses, were a very large,\r\ncoarse, long-legged, flat-ribbed variety, light in the fore-quarter, and\r\nshearing a long, heavy, coarse fleece of wool. They were formerly bred\r\nonly on the hills, and fatted in the valleys, of the Severn and the\r\nThames; but with the enclosures of the Cotswold hills, and the\r\nimprovement of their cultivation, they have been reared and fatted in\r\nthe same district. They were hardy, prolific breeders, and capital\r\nnurses; deficient in early maturity, and not possessing feeding\r\nproperties equalling those of the South-Down or New Leicester.\r\n\r\nThey have been extensively crossed with the Leicester sheep--producing\r\nthus the modern or improved Cotswold--by which their size and fleece\r\nhave been somewhat diminished, but their carcasses have been materially\r\nimproved, and their maturity rendered earlier. The wethers are sometimes\r\nfattened at fourteen months old, when they weigh from fifteen to\r\ntwenty-four pounds to a quarter; and at two years old, increase to\r\ntwenty or thirty pounds.\r\n\r\nThe wool is strong, mellow, and of good color, though rather coarse, six\r\nto eight inches in length, and from seven to eight pounds per fleece.\r\nThe superior hardihood of the improved Cotswold over the Leicester, and\r\ntheir adaptation to common treatment, together with the prolific nature\r\nof the ewes, and their abundance of milk, have rendered them in many\r\nplaces rivals of the New Leicester, and have obtained for them, of late\r\nyears, more attention to their selection and general treatment, under\r\nwhich management still farther improvement has been made. They have also\r\nbeen used in crossing other breeds, and have been mixed with the\r\nHampshire Downs. Indeed, the improved Cotswold, under the name of new,\r\nor improved Oxfordshire sheep, have frequently been the successful\r\ncandidates for prizes offered for the best long-woolled sheep at some of\r\nthe principal agricultural meetings or shows in England. The quality of\r\ntheir mutton is considered superior to that of the Leicester; the tallow\r\nbeing less abundant, with a larger development of muscle or flesh.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which the cross between the Cotswold and Leicester may be\r\ncarried, must depend upon the nature of the old stock, and on the\r\nsituation and character of the farm. In exposed situations, and somewhat\r\nscanty pasture, the old blood should decidedly prevail. On a more\r\nsheltered soil, and on land that will bear closer stocking, a greater\r\nuse may be made of the Leicester. Another circumstance that should guide\r\nthe farmer is the object which he has principally in view. If he expects\r\nto derive his chief profits from the wool, he will look to the\r\nprimitive Cotswolds; if he expects to gain more as a grazier, he will\r\nuse the Leicester ram more freely.\r\n\r\nSheep of this breed, now of established reputation, have been imported\r\ninto the United States by Messrs. Corning and Gotham, of Albany, and\r\nbred by the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEVIOT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHEVIOT EWE.]\r\n\r\nOn the steep, storm-lashed Cheviot hills, in the extreme north of\r\nEngland, this breed first attracted notice for their great hardiness in\r\nresisting cold, and for feeding on coarse, heathery herbage. A cross\r\nwith the Leicester, pretty generally resorted to, constitutes the\r\nimproved variety.\r\n\r\nThe Cheviot readily amalgamates with the Leicester--the rams employed in\r\nthe system of breeding, which has been extensively introduced for\r\nproducing the first cross of this descent, being of the pure Leicester\r\nbreed--and the progeny is superior in size, weight of wool, and tendency\r\nto fatten, to the native Cheviot. The benefit, however, may be said to\r\nend with the first cross; and the progeny of this mixed descent is\r\ngreatly inferior to the pure Leicester in form and fattening\r\nproperties, and to the pure Cheviot in hardiness of constitution.\r\n\r\nThe improved Cheviot has greatly extended itself throughout the\r\nmountains of Scotland, and in many instances supplanted the black-faced\r\nbreed; but the change, though often advantageous, has in some cases been\r\notherwise--the latter being somewhat hardier, and more capable of\r\nsubsisting on heathy pasturage. They are a hardy race, however, well\r\nsuited for their native pastures, bearing, with comparative impunity,\r\nthe storms of winter, and thriving well on poor keep. The purest\r\nspecimens are to be found on the Scotch side of the Cheviot hills, and\r\non the high and stony mountain farms which lie between that range and\r\nthe sources of the Teviot. These sheep are a capital mountain stock,\r\nprovided the pasture resembles those hills, in containing a good\r\nproportion of rich herbage. Though less hardy than the black-faced sheep\r\nof Scotland, they are more profitable as respects their feeding, making\r\nmore flesh on an equal quantity of food, and making it more quickly.\r\n\r\nThey have white faces and legs, open countenances, lively eyes, and are\r\nwithout horns; the ears are large, and somewhat singular, and there is\r\nmuch space between the ears and eyes; the carcass is long; the back\r\nstraight; the shoulders rather light; the ribs circular; and the\r\nquarters good. The legs are small in the bone, and covered with wool, as\r\nwell as the body, with the exception of the face. The wether is fit for\r\nthe butcher at three years old, and averages from twelve to eighteen\r\npounds a quarter; the mutton being of a good quality, though inferior to\r\nthe South-Down, and of less flavor than the black-faced. The Cheviot,\r\nthough a mountain breed, is quiet and docile, and easily managed.\r\n\r\nThe wool is about the quality of Leicester, coarse and long, suitable\r\nonly for the manufacture of low coatings and flushings. It closely\r\ncovers the body, assisting much in preserving it from the effects of wet\r\nand cold. The fleece averages about three and a half pounds. Formerly,\r\nthe wool was extensively employed in making cloths; but having given\r\nplace to the finer Saxony wools, it has sunk in price, and been confined\r\nto combing purposes. It has thus become altogether a secondary\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe Cheviots have become an American sheep by their repeated\r\nimportations into this country. The wool on several choice sheep,\r\nimported by Mr. Carmichael, of New York, was from five to seven inches\r\nlong, coarse, but well suited to combing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LINCOLN.\r\n\r\nThe old breed of Lincolnshire sheep was hornless, had white faces, and\r\nlong, thin, and weak carcasses; the ewes weighed from fourteen to twenty\r\npounds a quarter; the three-year old wethers from twenty to thirty\r\npounds; legs thick, rough and white; pelts thick; wool long--from ten to\r\neighteen inches--and covering a slow-feeding, coarse-grained carcass of\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\nA judicious system of breeding, which avoided Bakewell's errors, has\r\nwrought a decided improvement in this breed. The improved Lincolns\r\npossess a rather more desirable robustness, approaching, in some few\r\nspecimens, almost to coarseness, as compared with the finest Leicesters;\r\nbut they are more hardy, and less liable to disease. They attain as\r\nlarge a size, and yield as great an amount of wool, of about the same\r\nvalue. This breed, indeed, scarcely differs more from the Cotswold than\r\ndo flocks of a similar variety, which have been separately bred for\r\nseveral generations, from each other. They are prolific, and when\r\nwell-fed, the ewes will frequently produce two lambs at a birth, for\r\nwhich they provide liberally from their udders till the time for\r\nweaning. The weight of the fleece varies from four to eight pounds per\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nHaving alluded to the principal points of interest connected with the\r\nvarious breeds of sheep in the United States, our next business is with\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE SHEEP.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF THE SHEEP AS COVERED BY THE MUSCLES.\r\n\r\n1.

Between the _oris_, or sheep, and the\r\n_capra_, or goat, another _genus_ of the same family, the distinctions\r\nare well marked, although considerable resemblance exists between them.\r\nThe horns of the sheep have a spiral direction, while those of the goat\r\nhave a direction upward and backward; the sheep, except in a single wild\r\nvariety, has no beard, while the goat is bearded; the goat, in his\r\nhighest state of improvement, when he is made to produce wool of a\r\nfineness unequalled by the sheep--as in the Cashmere breed--is mainly,\r\nand always, externally covered with hair, while the hair on the sheep\r\nmay, by domestication, be reduced to a few coarse hairs, or got rid of\r\naltogether; and, finally, the pelt or skin of the goat has thickness\r\nvery far exceeding that of the sheep.\r\n\r\nThe age of sheep is usually reckoned, not from the time that they are\r\ndropped, but from the first shearing; although the first year may thus\r\ninclude fifteen or sixteen months, and sometimes more. When doubt exists\r\nrelative to the age, recourse is had to the teeth, since there is more\r\nuncertainty about the horn in this animal than in cattle; ewes that have\r\nbeen early bred, appearing always, according to the rings on the horn, a\r\nyear older than others that have been longer kept from the ram.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nSheep have no teeth in the upper jaw, but the bars or ridges of the\r\npalate thicken as they approach the forepart of the mouth; there also\r\nthe dense, fibrous, elastic matter, of which they are constituted,\r\nbecomes condensed, and forms a cushion or bed, which covers the converse\r\nextremity of the upper jaw, and occupies the place of the upper incisor,\r\nor cutting teeth, and partially discharge their functions. The herbage\r\nis firmly held between the front teeth in the lower jaw and this pad,\r\nand thus partly bitten and partly torn asunder. Of this, the rolling\r\nmotion of the head is sufficient proof.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are the same in number as in the mouth of the ox. There are\r\neight incisors or cutting-teeth in the forepart of the lower jaw, and\r\nsix molars in each jaw above and below, and on either side. The incisors\r\nare more admirably formed for grazing than in the ox. The sheep lives\r\ncloser, and is destined to follow the ox, and gather nourishment where\r\nthat animal would be unable to crop a single blade. This close life not\r\nonly loosens the roots of the grass, and disposes them to spread, but by\r\ncutting off the short suckers and sproutings--a wise provision of\r\nnature--causes the plants to throw out fresh, and more numerous, and\r\nstronger ones, and thus is instrumental in improving and increasing the\r\nvalue of the crop. Nothing will more expeditiously and more effectually\r\nmake a thick, permanent pasture than its being occasionally and closely\r\neaten down by sheep.\r\n\r\nIn order to enable the sheep to bite this close, the upper lip is deeply\r\ndivided, and free from hair about the centre of it. The part of the\r\ntooth above the gum is not only, as in other animals, covered with\r\nenamel, to enable it to bear and to preserve a sharpened edge, but the\r\nenamel on the upper part rises from the bone of the tooth nearly a\r\nquarter of an inch, and presenting a convex surface outward, and a\r\nconcave within, forms a little scoop or gorge of wonderful execution.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the lamb newly dropped is either without incisor teeth or\r\nit has two. The teeth rapidly succeed to each other, and before the\r\nanimal is a month old he has the whole of the eight. They continue to\r\ngrow with his growth until he is about fourteen or sixteen months old.\r\nThen, with the same previous process of diminution as in cattle, or\r\ncarried to a still greater degree, the two central teeth are shed, and\r\nattain their full growth when the sheep is two years old.\r\n\r\nIn examining a flock of sheep, however, there will often be very\r\nconsiderable difference in the teeth of those that have not been\r\nsheared, or those that have been once sheared; in some measure to be\r\naccounted for by a difference in the time of lambing, and likewise by\r\nthe general health and vigor of the animal. There will also be a\r\nmaterial difference in different animals, attributable to the good or\r\nbad keep which they have had. Those fed on good land, or otherwise well\r\nkept, will generally take the start of others that have been half\r\nstarved, and renew their teeth some months sooner than these. There are\r\nalso irregularities in the times of renewing the teeth, not to be\r\naccounted for by either of these circumstances; in fact, not to be\r\nexplained by any known circumstance relating to the breed or the keep of\r\nthe sheep. The want of improvement in sheep, which is occasionally\r\nobserved, and which cannot be accounted for by any deficiency or change\r\nof food, may sometimes be justly attributed to the tenderness of the\r\nmouth when the permanent teeth are protruding through the gums.\r\n\r\nBetween two and three years old the next two incisors are shed; and when\r\nthe sheep is actually three years old, the four central teeth are fully\r\ngrown; at four years old, he has six teeth fully grown; and at five\r\nyears old--one year before the horse or the ox can be said to be\r\nfull-mouthed--all the teeth are perfectly developed. The sheep is a much\r\nshorter-lived animal than the horse, and does not often attain the usual\r\nage of the ox. Their natural age is about ten years, to which age they\r\nwill breed and thrive well; though there are recorded instances of their\r\nbreeding at the age of fifteen, and of living twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe careless examiner may be sometimes deceived with regard to the\r\nfour-year-old mouth. He will see the teeth perfectly developed, no\r\ndiminutive ones at the sides, and the mouth apparently full; and then,\r\nwithout giving himself the trouble of counting the teeth, he will\r\nconclude that the animal is five years old. A process of displacement,\r\nas well as of diminution, has taken place here; the remaining outside\r\nmilk-teeth have not only shrunk to less than a fourth part of their\r\noriginal size, but the four-year-old teeth have grown before them and\r\nperfectly conceal them, unless the mouth is completely opened.\r\n\r\nAfter the permanent teeth have all appeared and are fully grown,\r\nthere is no criterion as to the age of the sheep. In most cases, the\r\nteeth remain sound for one or two years, and then, at uncertain\r\nintervals--either on account of the hard work in which they have been\r\nemployed, or from the natural effect of age--they begin to loosen and\r\nfall out; or, by reason of their natural slenderness, they are broken\r\noff. When favorite ewes, that have been kept for breeding, begin to lose\r\ncondition, at six or seven years old, their mouths should be carefully\r\nexamined. If any of the teeth are loose, they should be extracted, and a\r\nchance given to the animal to show how far, by browsing early and late,\r\nshe may be able to make up for the diminished number of her incisors. It\r\nfrequently happens that ewes with broken teeth, and some with all the\r\nincisors gone, will keep pace in condition with the best in the flock;\r\nbut they must be well taken care of in the winter, and, indeed, nursed\r\nto an extent that would scarcely answer the farmer's purpose to adopt as\r\na general rule, in order to prevent them from declining to such a degree\r\nas would make it very difficult afterward to fatten them for the\r\nbutcher. It may certainly be taken as a general rule, that when sheep\r\nbecome broken-mouthed they begin to decline.\r\n\r\nCauses of which the farmer is utterly ignorant, or over which he has no\r\ncontrol, will sometimes hasten the loss of the teeth. One thing,\r\nhowever, is certain--that close feeding, causing additional exercise,\r\ndoes wear them down; and that the sheep of farmers who stock unusually\r\nand unseasonably hard, lose their teeth much sooner than others do.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the sheep, in common with that of most animals, is composed\r\nof three textures. Externally is the cuticle, or scarf-skin, which is\r\nthin, tough, devoid of feeling, and pierced by innumerable minute holes,\r\nthrough which pass the fibres of the wool and the insensible\r\nperspiration. It seems to be of a scaly texture; although is not so\r\nevident as in many other animals, on account of a peculiar\r\nsubstance--the yolk--which is placed on it, to protect and nourish the\r\nroots of the wool. It is, however, sufficiently evident in the scab and\r\nother cutaneous eruptions to which this animal is liable.\r\n\r\nBelow this cuticle is the _rete mucosum_, a soft structure; its fibres\r\nhaving scarcely more consistence than mucilage, and being with great\r\ndifficulty separated from the skin beneath. This appears to be placed as\r\na defence to the terminations of the blood-vessels and nerves of the\r\nskin, which latter are, in a manner, enveloped and covered by it. The\r\ncolor of the skin, and probably that of the hair or wool also, is\r\ndetermined by the _rete mucosum_; or, at least, the hair and wool are of\r\nthe same color as this substance.\r\n\r\nBeneath the _rete mucosum_ is the _cutis_, or true skin, composed of\r\nnumberless minute fibres crossing each other in every direction; highly\r\nelastic, in order to fit closely to the parts beneath, and to yield to\r\nthe various motions of the body; and dense and firm in its structure,\r\nthat it may resist external injury. Blood-vessels and nerves innumerable\r\npierce it, and appear on its surface in the form of _papillae_, or\r\nminute eminences; while, through thousands of little orifices, the\r\nexhalent absorbents pour out the superfluous or redundant fluid. The\r\ntrue skin is composed, principally or almost entirely, of gelatine; so\r\nthat, although it may be dissolved by long-continued boiling, it is\r\ninsoluble in water at the common temperature. This organization seems to\r\nhave been given to it, not only for the sake of its preservation while\r\non the living animal, but that it may afterwards become useful to man.\r\nThe substance of the hide readily combining with the tanning principle,\r\nis converted into leather.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANATOMY OF THE WOOL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WALLACHIAN SHEEP.]\r\n\r\nOn the skin of most animals is placed a covering of feathers, fur, hair,\r\nor wool. These are all essentially the same in composition, being\r\ncomposed of an animal substance resembling coagulated albumen, together\r\nwith sulphur, silica, carbonate and phosphate of lime, and oxides of\r\niron and manganese.\r\n\r\nWool is not confined to the sheep. The under-hair of some goats is not\r\nonly finer than the fleece of any sheep, but it occasionally has the\r\ncrisped appearance of wool; being, in fact, wool of different qualities\r\nin different breeds--in some, rivalling or excelling that of the sheep,\r\nbut in others very coarse. A portion of wool is also found on many other\r\nanimals; as the deer, elk, the oxen of Tartary and Hudson's Bay, the\r\ngnu, the camel, many of the fur-clad animals, the sable, the polecat,\r\nand several species of the dog.\r\n\r\nJudging from the mixture of wool and hair in the coat of most animals,\r\nand the relative situation of these materials, it is not improbable that\r\nsuch was the character of the fleece of the primitive sheep. It has,\r\nindeed, been asserted that the primitive sheep was entirely covered with\r\nhair; but this is, doubtless, incorrect. There exists, at the present\r\nday, varieties of the sheep occupying extensive districts, that are\r\nclothed outwardly with hair of different degrees of fineness and\r\nsleekness; and underneath the external coat is a softer, shorter, and\r\ncloser one, that answers to the description of fur--according to most\r\ntravellers--but which really possesses all the characteristics of wool.\r\nIt is, therefore, highly improbable that the sheep--which has now\r\nbecome, by cultivation, the wool-bearing animal in a pre-eminent\r\ndegree--should, in any country, at any time, have ever been entirely\r\ndestitute of wool. Sheep of almost every variety have at times been in\r\nthe gardens of the London (Eng.) Zooelogical Society; but there has not\r\nbeen one on which a portion of crisped wool, although exceedingly small,\r\nhas not been discovered beneath the hair. In all the regions over which\r\nthe patriarchs wandered, and extending northward through the greater\r\npart of Europe and Asia, the sheep is externally covered with hair; but\r\nunderneath is a fine, short, downy wool, from which the hair is easily\r\nseparated. This is the case with the sheep at the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nand also in South America.\r\n\r\nThe change from hair to wool, though much influenced by temperature, has\r\nbeen chiefly effected by cultivation. Wherever hairy sheep are now found\r\nthe management of the animal is in a most disgraceful state; and among\r\nthe cultivated sheep the remains of this ancient hairy covering only\r\nexists, to any great extent, among those that are comparatively\r\nneglected or abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe filament of the wool has scarcely pushed itself through the pore of\r\nthe skin, when it has to penetrate through another and singular\r\nsubstance, which, from its adhesiveness and color, is called _the yolk_.\r\nThis is found in greatest quantity about the breast and shoulders--the\r\nvery parts that produce the best, and healthiest, and most abundant\r\nwool--and in proportion as it extends, in any considerable degree, over\r\nother parts, the wool is then improved. It differs in quantity in\r\ndifferent breeds. It is very abundant on the Merinos; it is sufficiently\r\nplentiful on most of the southern breeds, either to assist in the\r\nproduction of the wool, or to defend the sheep from the inclemency of\r\nthe weather; but in the northern districts, where the cold is more\r\nintense and the yolk of wool is deficient, a substitute for it is\r\nsometimes sought by smearing the sheep with a mixture of tar, oil, or\r\nbutter. Where there is a deficiency of yolk, the fibre of the wool is\r\ndry, harsh, and weak, and the whole fleece becomes thin and hairy; where\r\nthe natural quantity of it is found, the wool is soft, oily, plentiful\r\nand strong.\r\n\r\nThis yolk is not the inspissated or thickened perspiration of the\r\nanimal; it is not composed of matter which has been accidentally picked\r\nup, and which has lodged in the wool; but it is a peculiar secretion\r\nfrom the glands of the skin, destined to be one of the agents in the\r\nnourishment of the wool, and at the same time, by its adhesiveness, to\r\nmat the wool together, and form a secure defence from the wet and cold.\r\n\r\nChemical experiments have established its composition, as follows:\r\nfirst, of a soapy matter with a basis of potash, which forms the greater\r\npart of it; second, a small quantity of carbonate of potash; third, a\r\nperceptible quantity of acetate of potash; fourth, lime, in a peculiar\r\nand unknown state of combination; fifth, an atom of muriate of potash;\r\nsixth, an animal oil, to which its peculiar odor is attributable. All\r\nthese materials are believed to be essential to the yolk, and not found\r\nin it by mere accident, since the yolk of a great number of\r\nsamples--Spanish, French, English, and American--has been subjected to\r\nrepeated analyses, with the same result.\r\n\r\nThe yolk being a true soap, soluble in water, it is not difficult to\r\naccount for the comparative ease with which sheep that have the natural\r\nproportion of it are washed in a running stream. There is, however, a\r\nsmall quantity of fatty matter in the fleece, which is not in\r\ncombination with the alkali, and which, remaining attached to the wool,\r\nkeeps it a little glutinous, notwithstanding the most careful washing.\r\n\r\nThe fibre of the wool having penetrated the skin and escaped from\r\nthe yolk, is of a circular form, generally larger toward the extremity,\r\nand also toward the root, and in some instances very considerably\r\nso. The filaments of white wool, when cleansed from grease, are\r\nsemi-transparent; their surface in some places is beautifully polished,\r\nin others curiously incrusted, and they reflect the rays of light in a\r\nvery pleasing manner. When viewed by the aid of a powerful achromatic\r\nmicroscope, the central part of the fibre has a singularly glittering\r\nappearance. Minute filaments, placed very regularly, are sometimes seen\r\nbranching from the main trunk, like boughs from the principal stem. This\r\nexterior polish varies much in different wools, and in wools from the\r\nsame breed of sheep at different times. When the animal is in good\r\ncondition, and the fleece healthy, the appearance of the fibre is really\r\nbrilliant; but when the state of the constitution is bad, the fibre has\r\na dull appearance, and either a wan, pale light, or sometimes scarcely\r\nany, is reflected. As a general rule, the filament is most transparent\r\nin the best and most useful wools, whether long or short. It increases\r\nwith the improvement of the breed, and the fineness and healthiness of\r\nthe fleece; yet it must be admitted that some wools have different\r\ndegrees of the transparency and opacity, which do not appear to affect\r\ntheir value and utility. It is, however, the difference of transparency\r\nin the same fleece, or in the same filament, that is chiefly to be\r\nnoticed as improving the value of the wool.\r\n\r\nAs to the size of the fibre, the terms \"fine\" and \"coarse,\" as commonly\r\nused, are but vague and general descriptions of wool. All fine fleeces\r\nhave some coarse wool, and all coarse fleeces some fine. The most\r\naccurate classification is to distinguish the various qualities of wool\r\nin the order in which they are esteemed and preferred by the\r\nmanufacturer--as the following: first, fineness with close ground, that\r\nis, thick-matted ground; second, pureness; third, straight-haired, when\r\nbroken by drawing; fourth, elasticity, rising after compression in the\r\nhand; fifth, staple not too long; sixth, color; seventh, what coarse\r\nexists to be very coarse; eighth, tenacity; and ninth, not much\r\npitch-mark, though this is no disadvantage, except the loss of weight in\r\nscouring. The bad or disagreeable properties are--thin, grounded, tossy,\r\ncurly-haired, and, if in a sorted state, little in it that is very fine;\r\na tender staple, as elasticity, many dead white hairs, very yolky. Those\r\nwho buy wool for combing and other light goods that do not need milling,\r\nwish to find length of staple, fineness of hair, whiteness, tenacity,\r\npureness, elasticity, and not too many pitch-marks.\r\n\r\nThe property first attracting attention, and being of greater importance\r\nthan any other, is _the fineness_ of the pile--the quantity of fine wool\r\nwhich a fleece yields, and the degree of that fineness. Of the absolute\r\nfineness, little can be said, varying, as it does, in different parts of\r\nthe same fleece to a very considerable degree, and the diameter of the\r\nsame fibre often being exceedingly different at the extremity and the\r\ncentre. The micrometer has sometimes indicated that the diameter of the\r\nformer is five times as much as that of the latter; and, consequently,\r\nthat a given length of yield taken from the extremity would weigh\r\ntwenty-five times as much as the same length taken from the centre and\r\ncleansed from all yolk and grease. That fibre may be considered as\r\ncoarse whose diameter is more than the five-hundredth part of an inch;\r\nin some of the most valuable samples of Saxony wool it has not exceeded\r\nthe nine-hundredth part; yet in some animals, whose wool has not been\r\nused for manufacturing purposes, it is less than one twelve-hundredth\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe extremities of the wool, and frequently those portions which are\r\nnear to the root, are larger than the intermediate parts. The extremity\r\nof the fibre has, generally, the greatest bulk of all. It is the\r\nproduct of summer, soon after shearing-time, when the secretion of the\r\nmatter of the wool is increased, and when the pores of the skin are\r\nrelaxed and open, and permit a larger fibre to protrude. The portion\r\nnear the root is the growth of spring, when the weather is getting warm;\r\nand the intermediate part is the offspring of winter, when under the\r\ninfluence of the cold the pores of the skin contract, and permit only a\r\nfiner hair to escape. If, however, the animal is well fed, the\r\ndiminution of the bulk of the fibre will not be followed by weakness or\r\ndecay, but, in proportion as the pile becomes fine, the value of the\r\nfleece will be increased; whereas, if cold and starvation should go\r\nhand-in-hand, the woolly fibre will not only diminish in bulk, but in\r\nhealth, strength, and worth.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the diameter of the wool in different parts of the\r\nfibre will also curiously correspond with the degree of heat at the time\r\nthe respective portions were produced. The fibre of the wool and the\r\nrecord of the meteorologist will singularly agree, if the variations in\r\ntemperature are sufficiently distinct from each other for any\r\nappreciable part of the fibre to form. It follows from this, that--the\r\nnatural tendency to produce wool of a certain fibre being the\r\nsame--sheep in a hot climate will yield a comparatively coarse wool, and\r\nthose in a cold climate will carry a finer, but at the same time a\r\ncloser and a warmer fleece. In proportion to the coarseness of a fleece\r\nwill generally be its openness, and its inability to resist either cold\r\nor wet; while the coat of softer, smaller, more pliable wool will admit\r\nof no interstices between its fibres, and will bid defiance to frost and\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\nThe natural instinct of the sheep would seem to teach the wool-grower\r\nthe advantage of attending to the influence of temperature upon the\r\nanimal. He is evidently impatient of heat. In the open districts, and\r\nwhere no shelter is near, he climbs to the highest parts of his walk,\r\nthat, if the rays of the sun must still fall on him, he may nevertheless\r\nbe cooled by the breeze; but, if shelter is near, of whatever kind,\r\nevery shaded spot is crowded with sheep. The wool of the Merinos after\r\nshearing-time is hard and coarse to such a degree as to render it very\r\ndifficult to suppose that the same animal could bear wool so opposite in\r\nquality, compared with that which had been clipped from it in the course\r\nof the same season. As the cold weather advances, the fleeces recover\r\ntheir soft quality.\r\n\r\nPasture has a far greater influence on the fineness of the fleece. The\r\nstaple of the wool, like every other part of the sheep, must increase in\r\nlength or in bulk when the animal has a superabundance of nutriment;\r\nand, on the other hand, the secretion which forms the wool must decrease\r\nlike every other, when sufficient nourishment is not afforded. When\r\nlittle cold has been experienced in the winter, and vegetation has\r\nscarcely been checked, the sheep yields an abundant crop of wool, but\r\nthe fleece is perceptibly coarser as well as heavier. When the frost has\r\nbeen severe, and the ground long covered with snow, if the flock has\r\nbeen fairly supplied with nutriment, although the fleece may have lost a\r\nlittle in weight, it will have acquired a superior degree of fineness,\r\nand a proportional increase of value. Should, however, the sheep have\r\nbeen neglected and starved during this continued cold weather, the\r\nfleece as well as the carcass is thinner, and although it may have\r\npreserved its smallness of filament, it has lost in weight, and\r\nstrength, and usefulness.\r\n\r\nConnected with fineness is _trueness of staple_--as equal in growth as\r\npossible over the animals--a freedom from those shaggy portions, here\r\nand there, which are occasionally observed on poor and neglected sheep.\r\nThese portions are always coarse and comparatively worthless, and they\r\nindicate an irregular and unhealthy action of the secretion of wool,\r\nwhich will also probably weaken or render the fibre diseased in other\r\nparts. Included in trueness of fibre is another circumstance to which\r\nallusion has already been made--a freedom from coarse hairs which\r\nproject above the general level of the wool in various parts, or, if\r\nthey are not externally seen, mingle with the wool and debase its\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\n_Soundness_ is closely associated with trueness. It means, generally\r\nspeaking, strength of the fibre, and also a freedom from those breaches\r\nor withered portions of which something has previously been said. The\r\neye will readily detect the breaches; but the hair generally may not\r\npossess a degree of strength proportioned to its bulk. This is\r\nascertained by drawing a few hairs out of the staple, and grasping each\r\nof them singly by both ends, and pulling them until they break. The wool\r\noften becomes injured by felting while it is on the sheep's back. This\r\nis principally seen in the heavy breeds, especially those that are\r\nneglected and half-starved, and generally begins in the winter season,\r\nwhen the coat has been completely saturated with water, and it increases\r\nuntil shearing-time, unless the cob separates from the wool beneath, and\r\ndrops off.\r\n\r\nWool is generally injured by keeping. It will probably increase a\r\nlittle in weight for a few months, especially if kept in a damp place;\r\nbut after that it will somewhat rapidly become lighter, until a very\r\nconsiderable loss will often be sustained. This, however, is not the\r\nmoral of the case; for, except very great care is taken, the moth will\r\nget into the bundles and injure and destroy the staple; and that which\r\nremains untouched by them will become considerably harsh and less\r\npliable. If to this the loss of the interest of money is added, it will\r\nbe seen that he seldom acts wisely who hoards his wool, when he can\r\nobtain what approaches to a fair remunerating price for it.\r\n\r\n_Softness_ of the wool is evidently connected with the presence and\r\nquality of the yolk. This substance is undoubtedly designed not only to\r\nnourish the hair, but to give it richness and pliability. The growth of\r\nthe yolk ought to be promoted, and agriculturists ought to pay more\r\nattention to the quantity and quality of yolk possessed by the animals\r\nselected for the purpose of breeding.\r\n\r\nBad management impairs the pliability of the wool, by arresting the\r\nsecretion of the yolk. The softness of the wool is also much influenced\r\nby the chemical elements of the soil. A chalky soil notoriously\r\ndeteriorates it; minute particles of the chalk being necessarily brought\r\ninto contact with the fleece and mixing with it, have a corrosive effect\r\non the fibre, and harden it and render it less pliable. The particles of\r\nchalk come in contact with the yolk--there being a chemical affinity\r\nbetween the alkali and the oily matter of the yolk--immediately unite,\r\nand a true soap is formed. The first storm washes a portion of it; and\r\nthe wool, deprived of its natural pabulum and unguent, loses some of its\r\nvital properties--its pliability among the rest. The slight degree of\r\nharshness which has been attributed to the English South-Down has been\r\nexplained in this way.\r\n\r\n_The felting property_ of wool is a tendency of the fibres to entangle\r\nthemselves together, and to form a mass more or less difficult to\r\nunravel. By moisture and pressure, the fibres of the wool may become\r\nmatted or felted together into a species of cloth. The manufacture of\r\nfelt was the first mode in which wool was applied to clothing, and felt\r\nhas long been in universal use for hats. The fulling of flannels and\r\nbroadcloths is effected by the felting principle. By the joint influence\r\nof the moisture and the pressure, certain of the fibres are brought into\r\nmore intimate contact with each other; they adhere--not only the fibres,\r\nbut; in a manner, the threads--and the cloth is taken from the mill\r\nshortened in all its dimensions; it has become a kind of felt, for the\r\nthreads have disappeared, and it can be cut in every direction with very\r\nlittle or no unravelling; it is altogether a thicker, warmer, softer\r\nfibre. This felting property is one of the most valuable qualities\r\npossessed by wool, and on this property are the finer kinds of wool\r\nespecially valued by the manufacturer for the finest broadcloths. This\r\nnaturally suggests a consideration of the various forms in the structure\r\non which it depends.\r\n\r\nThe most evident distinction between the qualities of hair and wool is\r\nthe comparative straightness of the former, and _the crisped or\r\nspirally-curling form_ which the latter assumes. If a little lock of\r\nwool is held up to the light, every fibre of it is twisted into numerous\r\nminute corkscrew-like ringlets. This is especially seen in the fleece of\r\nthe short-woolled sheeps; but, although less striking, it is obvious\r\neven in wool of the largest staple.\r\n\r\nThe spirally-curving form of wool used, erroneously, to be considered as\r\nthe chief distinction between the covering of the goat and the sheep;\r\nbut the under-coat of some of the former is finer than that of any\r\nsheep, and it is now acknowledged frequently to have the crisped and\r\ncurled appearance of wool. In some breeds of cattle, particularly in one\r\nvariety of the Devons, the hair assumes a curled and wavy appearance,\r\nand a few of the minute spiral ringlets have been occasionally seen. It\r\nis the same with many of the Highlands; but there is no determination to\r\ntake on the true crisped character, and throughout its whole extent, and\r\nit is still nothing but hair. On some foreign breeds, however, as the\r\nyak of Tartary, and the ox of Hudson's Bay, some fine and valuable wool\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\nThere is an intimate connection between the fineness of the wool and the\r\nnumber of the curves, at least in sheep yielding wool of nearly the same\r\nlength; so that, whether the wool of different sheep is examined, or\r\nthat from different parts of the same sheep, it is enough for the\r\nobserver to take advice of the number of curves in a given space, in\r\norder to ascertain with sufficient accuracy the fineness of the fibre.\r\n\r\nTo this curled form of the wool not enough attention is, as a general\r\nthing, paid by the breeder. It is, however, that on which its most\r\nvaluable uses depend. It is that which is essential to it in the\r\nmanufactory of cloths. The object of the carder is to break the wool in\r\npieces at the curves--the principle of the thread is the adhesion of the\r\nparticles together by their curves; and the fineness of the thread, and\r\nconsequent fineness of the cloth, will depend on the minuteness of\r\nthese curves, or the number of them found in a given length of fibre.\r\n\r\nIt will readily be seen that this curling form has much to do with the\r\nfelting property of wool; it materially contributes to that disposition\r\nin the fibres which enables them to attach and intwine themselves\r\ntogether; it multiplies the opportunities for this interlacing, and it\r\nincreases the difficulty of unravelling the felt.\r\n\r\nThe felting property of wool is the most important, as well as the\r\ndistinguishing one; but it varies essentially in different breeds, and\r\nthe usefulness and the consequent value of the fleece, for clothing\r\npurposes, at least, depend on the degree to which it is pursued.\r\n\r\n_The serrated_--notched, like the teeth of a saw--_edge_ of wool, which\r\nhas been discovered by means of the microscope, is also, as well as the\r\nspiral curl, deemed an important quality in the felting property.\r\nRepeated microscopic observations have removed all doubts as to the\r\ngeneral outline of the woolly fibre. It consists of a central stem or\r\nstalk, probably hollow, or, at least, porous, possessing a\r\nsemi-transparency, not found in the fibre of hair. From this central\r\nstalk there springs, at different distances, on different breeds of\r\nsheep, a circlet of leaf-shaped projections.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG WOOL.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable of the long-woolled fleeces are of British origin. A\r\nconsiderable quantity is produced in France and Belgium; but the\r\nmanufacturers in those countries acknowledge the superiority of the\r\nBritish wool. Long wool is distinguished, as its name would import, by\r\nthe length of its staple, the average of which is about eight inches.\r\nIt was much improved, of late years, both in England and in other\r\ncountries. Its staple has, without detriment to its manufacturing\r\nqualities, become shorter; but it has also become finer, truer, and\r\nsounder. The long-woolled sheep has been improved more than any other\r\nbreed; and the principal error which Bakewell committed having been\r\nrepaired since his death, the long wool has progressively risen in\r\nvalue, at least for curling purposes. Some of the breeds have staples of\r\ndouble the length that has been mentioned as the average one. Pasture\r\nand breeding are the powerful agents here.\r\n\r\nProbably because the Leicester blood prevails in, or, at least, mingles\r\nwith, every other long-woolled breed, a great similarity in the\r\nappearance and quality of this fleece has become apparent, of late\r\nyears, in every district of England. The short-woolled fleeces are, to a\r\nvery considerable degree, unlike in fineness, elasticity, and felting\r\nproperty; the sheep themselves are still more unlike; but the long-wools\r\nhave, in a great degree, lost their distinctive points--the Lincoln, for\r\nexample, has not all of his former gaunt carcass, and coarse, entangled\r\nwool--the Cotswold has become a variety of the Leicester--in fact, all\r\nthe long-woolled sheep, both in appearance and fleece, have almost\r\nbecome of one variety; and rarely, except from culpable neglect in the\r\nbreeder, has the fleece been injuriously weakened, or too much\r\nshortened, for the most valuable purposes to which it is devoted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its length, this wool is characterized by its strength,\r\nits transparency, its comparative stoutness, and the slight degree in\r\nwhich it possesses the felting property. Since the extension of the\r\nprocess of combing to wools of a shorter staple, the application of\r\nthis wool to manufacturing purposes has undergone considerable change.\r\nIn some respects, the range of its use has been limited; but its demand\r\nhas, on the whole, increased, and its value is more highly appreciated.\r\nIndeed, there are certain important branches of the woollen manufacture,\r\nsuch as worsted stuffs, bombazines, muslin-delaines, etc., in which it\r\ncan never be superseded; and its rapid extension in the United States,\r\nwithin the past few years, clearly shows that a large and increasing\r\ndemand for this kind of wool will continue at remunerating prices.\r\n\r\nThis long wool is classed under two divisions, distinguished both by\r\nlength and the fineness of the fibre. The first--_the long-combing\r\nwool_--is used for the manufacture of hard yarn, and the worsted goods\r\nfor which that thread is adapted, and requires the staple to be long,\r\nfirm, and little disposed to felt. _The short-combing wool_ has, as its\r\nname implies, a shorter staple, and is finer and more felty; the felt is\r\nalso closer and softer, and is chiefly used for hosiery goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIDDLE WOOL.\r\n\r\nThis article is of more recent origin than the former, but has rapidly\r\nincreased in quantity and value. It can never supersede, but will only\r\nstand next in estimation to, the native English long fleece. It is\r\nyielded by the half-bred sheep--a race that becomes more numerous every\r\nyear--being a cross of the Leicester ram with the South-Down, or some\r\nother short-woolled ewe; retaining the fattening property and the early\r\nmaturity of the Leicester, or of both; and the wool deriving length and\r\nstraightness of fibre from the one, and fineness and feltiness from the\r\nother. The average length of staple is about five inches. There is no\r\ndescription of the finer stuff-goods in which this wool is not most\r\nextensively and advantageously employed; and the nails, or portions\r\nwhich are broken off by the comb, and left in, whether belonging to this\r\ndescription of wool or to the long wool, are used in the manufacture of\r\nseveral species of cloth of no inferior quality or value.\r\n\r\nUnder the breed of middle wools must be classed those which, when there\r\nwere but two divisions, were known by the name of short wools; and if\r\nEnglish productions were alone treated of, would still retain the same\r\ndistinctive appellation. To this class belong the South-Down and\r\nCheviot; together with the fleece of several other breeds, not so\r\nnumerous, nor occupying so great an extent of country. From the change,\r\nhowever, which insensibly took place in them all--the lengthening, and\r\nthe increased thickness of the fibre, and, more especially, from the\r\ngradual introduction of other wools possessing delicacy of fibre,\r\npliability, and felting qualities beyond what these could claim, and at\r\nthe same time, being cheaper in the market--they lost ground in the\r\nmanufacture of the finer cloths, and have for some time ceased to be\r\nused in the production of them. On the other hand, the changes which\r\nhave taken place in the construction of machinery have multiplied the\r\npurposes to which they may be devoted, and very considerably enhanced\r\ntheir value.\r\n\r\nThese wools, of late, rank among the combing wools; they are prepared as\r\nmuch by the comb as by the card, and in some places more. On this\r\naccount they meet with a readier sale, at fair, remunerating prices,\r\nconsidering the increased weight of each individual fleece, and the\r\nincreased weight and earlier maturity of the carcass. The South-Downs\r\nyield about seven-tenths of the pure short wools grown in the British\r\nkingdoms; but the half-bred sheep has, as has been remarked, encroached\r\non the pure short-woolled one. The average staple of middle-woolled\r\nsheep is three and a half inches.\r\n\r\nThese wools are employed in the manufacture of flannels, army and navy\r\ncloths, coatings, heavy cloths for calico printers and paper\r\nmanufacturers, woollen cords, coarse woollens, and blankets; besides\r\nbeing partially used in cassinettes, baizes, bockings, carpets,\r\ndruggets, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT WOOL.\r\n\r\nFrom this division every wool of English production is excluded. These\r\nwools, yielded by the Merinos, are employed, unmixed, in the manufacture\r\nof the finer cloths, and, combined with a small proportion of wool from\r\nthe English breeds, in others of an inferior value. The average length\r\nof staple is about two and a half inches.\r\n\r\nThese wools even may be submitted to the action of the comb. There may\r\nbe fibres only one inch in length; but if there are others from two and\r\na half to three inches, so that the average of the staple shall be two\r\ninches, a thread sufficiently tenacious may, from the improved state of\r\nmachinery, be spun, and many delicate and beautiful fabrics readily\r\nwoven, which were unknown not many years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCROSSING AND BREEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one breed of sheep combines the highest perfection in all those\r\npoints which give value to this race of animals. One is remarkable for\r\nthe weight, or early maturity, or excellent quality of its carcass,\r\nwhile it is deficient in quality or quantity of wool; and another, which\r\nis valuable for wool, is comparatively deficient in carcass. Some\r\nvarieties will flourish only under certain conditions of food and\r\nclimate; while others are much less affected by those conditions, and\r\nwill subsist under the greatest variations of temperature, and on the\r\nmost opposite qualities of verdure.\r\n\r\nIn selecting a breed for any given locality, reference should be had,\r\n_first_, to the feed and climate, or the surrounding natural\r\ncircumstances; and, _second_, to the market facilities and demand.\r\nChoice should then be made of that breed which, with the advantages\r\npossessed, and under all the circumstances, will yield the greatest net\r\nvalue of the marketable product.\r\n\r\nRich lowland herbage, in a climate which allows it to remain green\r\nduring a large portion of the year, is favorable to the production of\r\nlarge carcasses. If convenient to a market where mutton finds a prompt\r\nsale and good prices, then all the conditions are realized which calls\r\nfor a mutton-producing, as contradistinguished from a wool-yielding,\r\nsheep. Under such circumstances, the choice should undoubtedly be made\r\nfrom the improved English varieties--the South-Down, the New Leicester,\r\nand the improved Cotswolds or New Oxfordshire sheep. In deciding between\r\nthese, minor and more specific circumstances must be taken into account.\r\nIf large numbers are to be kept, the Downs will herd--remain thriving\r\nand healthy when kept together in large numbers--much better than the\r\ntwo larger breeds; if the feed, though generally plentiful, is liable to\r\nbe somewhat short during the droughts of summer, and there is not a\r\ncertain supply of the most nutritious winter feed, the Downs will better\r\nendure occasional short keep; if the market demands a choice and\r\nhigh-flavored mutton, the Downs possess a decided superiority. If, on\r\nthe other hand, but few are to be kept in the same enclosure, the large\r\nbreeds will be as healthy as the Downs; if the pastures are somewhat wet\r\nor marshy, the former will better subsist on the rank herbage which\r\nusually grows in such situations; if they do not afford so fine a\r\nquality of mutton, they--particularly the Leicester--possess an earlier\r\nmaturity, and give more meat for the amount of food consumed, as well as\r\nyield more tallow.\r\n\r\nThe next point of comparison between the long and the middle woolled\r\nfamilies, is the value of their wool. Though not the first or principal\r\nobject aimed at in the cultivation of any of these breeds, it is, in\r\nthis country, an important item of incident in determining their\r\nrelative profitableness. The American Leicester yields about six pounds\r\nof long, coarse, combing wool; the Cotswold, somewhat more; but this\r\nperhaps counterbalanced by these considerations; the Downs grow three to\r\nfour pounds of a low quality of carding wool. None of these wools are\r\nvery salable, at remunerating prices, in the American markets. Both,\r\nhowever, will appreciate in proportion to the increase of manufactures\r\nof worsted, flannels, baizes, and the like. The difference in the weight\r\nof the fleeces between the breeds is, of itself, a less important\r\nconsideration than it would at first appear, for reasons which will be\r\ngiven when the connection between the amount of wool produced and the\r\nfood consumed by the sheep is noticed.\r\n\r\nThe Cheviots are unquestionably inferior to the breeds above named,\r\nexcept in a capacity to endure a vigorous winter and to subsist on\r\nhealthy herbage. Used in the natural and artificial circumstances which\r\nsurround sheep-husbandry in many parts of England--where the fattest and\r\nfinest quality of mutton is consumed, as almost the only animal food of\r\nthe laboring classes--the heavy, early-maturing New Leicester, and the\r\nstill heavier New Oxfordshire sheep seem exactly adapted to the wants of\r\nproducers and consumers, and are of unrivalled value. To depasture\r\npoorer soils, sustain a folding system, and furnish the mutton which\r\nsupplies the tables of the wealthy, the South-Down meets an equal\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\nSufficient attention is by no means paid in many portions of the country\r\nto the profit which could be made to result from the cultivation of the\r\nsheep. One of the most serious defects in the prevalent husbandry of New\r\nEngland, for example, is the neglect of sheep. Ten times the present\r\nnumber might be easily fed, and they would give in meat, wool, and\r\nprogeny, more direct profit than any other domestic animal, while the\r\nfood which they consume would do more towards fertilizing the farms than\r\nan equal amount consumed by any other animal. It is notorious that the\r\npastures of that section of the country have seriously deteriorated in\r\nfertility and become overrun with worthless weeds and bushes to the\r\nexclusion of nutritious grasses.\r\n\r\nWith sheep--as well as with all other animals--much or prolonged\r\nexercise in pursuit of food, or otherwise, is unfavorable to taking on\r\nfat. Some seem to forget, in their earnest advocacy of the merits of the\r\ndifferent breeds, that the general physical laws which control the\r\ndevelopment of all the animal tissues as well as functions, are uniform.\r\nBetter organs will, doubtless, make a better appropriation of animal\r\nfood; and they may be taught, so to speak, to appropriate it in\r\nparticular directions: in one breed, more especially to the production\r\nof fat; in another, of muck, or lean meat; in yet another, of wool. But,\r\nthese things being equal, large animals will always require more food\r\nthan small ones. Animals which are to be carried to a high state of\r\nfatness must have plentiful and nutritious food, and they must exercise\r\nbut little, in order to prevent the unnecessary combustion in the lungs\r\nof that carbon which forms nearly four-fifths of their fat. No art of\r\nbreeding can counteract these established laws of Nature.\r\n\r\nIn instituting a comparison between breeds of sheep for _wool-growing_\r\npurposes, it is undeniable that the question is not, what variety will\r\nshear the heaviest or even the most valuable fleece, irrespective of\r\nthe cost of production. Cost of feed and care, and every other expense,\r\nmust be deducted, in order to fairly test the profits of an animal.\r\nIf a large sheep consume twice as much food as a small one, and give\r\nbut once and a-half as much wool, it is obviously more profitable--other\r\nthings being equal--to keep two of the smaller sheep. The next question,\r\nthen, is,--_from what breed_--with the same expense in other\r\nparticulars--_will the verdure of an acre of land produce the greatest\r\nvalue of wool_?\r\n\r\nAnd, first, as to the comparative amount of food consumed by the several\r\nbreeds. There are no satisfactory experiments which show that _breed_,\r\nin itself considered, has any particular influence on the quantity of\r\nfood consumed. It is found, with all varieties, that the consumption is\r\nin proportion to the live weight of the grown animal. Of course, this\r\nrule is not invariable in its individual application; but its general\r\nsoundness has been satisfactorily established. Grown sheep take up\r\nbetween two and a half and three and a third per cent. of their weight,\r\nin what is equivalent to dry hay, to keep themselves in store condition.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of food, then, being proportioned to the weight, it\r\nfollows that, if one acre is capable of sustaining three Merinos,\r\nweighing one hundred pounds each, it will sustain two Leicesters,\r\nweighing one hundred and fifty each, and two and two-fifth South-Downs,\r\nweighing one hundred and twenty-five each. Merinos of this weight often\r\nshear five pounds per fleece, taking flocks through. The herbage of an\r\nacre, then, would give fifteen pounds of Merino wool, twelve of\r\nLeicester, and but nine and three-fifths of South-Down--estimating the\r\nlatter as high as four pounds to the fleece. Even the finest and\r\nlightest-fleeced sheep known as Merinos average about four pounds to the\r\nfleece; so that the feed of an acre would produce as much of the highest\r\nquality of wool sold under the name of Merino as it would of New\r\nLeicester, and more than it would of South-Down, while the former would\r\nbe worth from fifty to one hundred per cent. more per pound than either\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nNor does this indicate all the actual difference, as in the foregoing\r\nestimate the live weight of the English breeds is placed low, and that\r\nof the Merinos high. The live weight of the five-pound fine-fleeced\r\nMerino does not exceed ninety pounds; it ranges, in fact, from eighty to\r\nninety; so that three hundred pounds of live weight--it being understood\r\nthat all of these live weights refer to ewes in fair ordinary, or what\r\nis called store, condition--would give a still greater product of wool\r\nto the acre. It is perfectly safe, therefore, to say that the herbage of\r\nan acre will uniformly give nearly double the value of Merino that it\r\nwill of any of the English long or middle wools.\r\n\r\nWhat are the other relative expenses of these breeds? The full-blooded\r\nLeicester is in no respect a hardier sheep than the Merino, though some\r\nof its crosses are much hardier than the pure-bred sheep: indeed, it is\r\nless hardy, under the most favorable circumstances. It is more subject\r\nto colds; its constitution more readily gives way under disease; the\r\nlambs are more liable to perish from exposure to cold, when newly\r\ndropped. Under unfavorable circumstances--herded in large flocks,\r\nfamished for feed, or subjected to long journeys--its capacity to\r\nendure, and its ability to rally from sad drawbacks, do not compare,\r\nwith those of the Merino. The high-bred South-Down, though considerably\r\nless hardy than the unimproved parent stock, is still fairly entitled to\r\nthe appellation of a hardy animal; it is, in fact, about on a pace with\r\nthe Merino, though it will not bear as hard stocking, without a rapid\r\ndiminution in size and quality. If the peculiar merits of the animal are\r\nto be considered in determining the expenses, as they surely should be,\r\nthe superior fecundity of the South-Down is a point in its favor, as\r\nwell for a wool-producing as a mutton sheep. The ewe not only frequently\r\nproduces twin lambs--as do both the Merino and Leicester--but, unlike\r\nthe latter, she possesses nursing properties to do justice to them. This\r\nadvantage, however, is fully counterbalanced by the superior longevity\r\nof the Merino. All the English mutton breeds begin to rapidly\r\ndeteriorate in amount of wool, capacity to fatten, and general vigor, at\r\nabout five years old; and their early maturity is no offset to this, in\r\nan animal kept for wool-growing purposes. This early decay requires\r\nearlier and more rapid slaughter than is always economically convenient,\r\nor even possible.\r\n\r\nIt is well, on properly stocked farms, to slaughter or turn off the\r\nMerino wether at four or five years old, to make room for the breeding\r\nstock; but he will not particularly deteriorate, and he will richly pay\r\nthe way with his fleece for several years longer. Breeding ewes are\r\nrarely turned off before eight, and are frequently kept until ten years\r\nold, at which period they exhibit no greater marks of age than do the\r\nDowns and Leicester at five or six. Instances are known of Merino ewes\r\nbreeding uniformly until fifteen years old. The improved Cotswold is\r\nsaid to be hardier than the Leicester; but this variety, from their\r\ngreat size, and the consequent amount of food consumed by them, together\r\nwith the other necessary incidents connected with the breeding of such\r\nlarge animals, is incapacitated from being generally introduced as a\r\nwool-growing sheep. All the coarse races have one advantage over the\r\nMerino: they are less subject to the visitation of the hoof-ail, and\r\nwhen untreated, this disease spreads with less violence and malignity\r\namong them. This has been explained by the fact that their hoofs do not\r\ngrow long and turn under from the sides, as do those of the Merino, and\r\nthus retain dirt and filth in constant contact with the foot.\r\n\r\nTaking into account all the circumstances connected with the peculiar\r\nmanagement of each race, together with all the incidents, exigencies,\r\nand risks of the husbandry of each, it may be confidently asserted that\r\nthe expenses, other than those of feed, are not smaller per head, or\r\neven in the number required to stock an acre, in either of the English\r\nbreeds above referred to, than in the Merino. Indeed, it may well be\r\ndoubted whether any of those English breeds, except the South-Down, is\r\non an equality, even, with the Merino, in these respects. For\r\nwool-growing purposes, the Merino, then, possesses a marked and decided\r\nsuperiority over the best breeds and families of coarse-woolled sheep.\r\nAs a mutton sheep, it is inferior to some of those breeds; although not\r\nso much as is popularly supposed. Many persons, who have never tasted\r\nMerino mutton, and who have, consequently, an unfavorable impression of\r\nit, would, if required to consume the fat and lean together, find it\r\nmore palatable than the luscious and over-fat New Leicester. The mutton\r\nof the cross between the Merino and the Native would certainly be\r\npreferred to the Leicester, by anybody but an English laborer,\r\naccustomed to the latter, since it is short-grained, tender, and of good\r\nflavor. The same is true of the crosses with the English varieties,\r\nwhich will hereafter be treated of more particularly. Grade Merino\r\nwethers, half-bloods, for example, are favorites with the drover and\r\nbutcher, being of good size, extraordinarily heavy for their apparent\r\nbulk, by reason of the shortness of their wool, compared with the coarse\r\nbreeds, making good mutton, tallowing well, and their pelts, from the\r\ngreater weight of wool on them, commanding an extra price. In speaking\r\nof the Merino in this connection, no reference is made to the Saxons,\r\nthough they are, as is well known, pure-blooded descendants of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nAssuming it, then, as settled, that it is to the Merino race that the\r\nwool-grower must look for the most profitable sheep, a few\r\nconsiderations are subjoined as to the adaptability of the widely\r\ndiverse sub-varieties of the race to the wants and circumstances of\r\ndifferent portions of the country.\r\n\r\nUpon the first introduction of the Saxons, they were sought with avidity\r\nby the holders of the fine-woolled flocks of the country, consisting at\r\nthat time of pure or grade Merinos. Under the decisive encouragement\r\noffered both to the wool-grower and the manufacturer by the tariff of\r\n1828, a great impetus was given to the production of the finest wools,\r\nand the Saxon everywhere superseded, or bred out by crossing, the\r\nSpanish Merinos. In New York and New England, the latter almost entirely\r\ndisappeared. In the fine-wool mania which ensued, weight of fleece,\r\nconstitution, and every thing else, were sacrificed to the quality of\r\nthe wool. Then came the tariff of 1832, which, as well as that of 1828,\r\ngave too much protection to both wool-grower and manufacturer, into\r\nwhose pursuits agricultural and mercantile speculators madly rushed.\r\nSkill without capital, capital without skill, and in some cases,\r\nprobably, thirst for gain without either, laid hold of these favored\r\navocations. The natural and inevitable result followed. In the financial\r\ncrisis of 1837, manufacturing, and all other monetary enterprises which\r\nhad not been conducted with skill and providence, and which were not\r\nbased on an adequate and vast capital, were involved in a common\r\ndestruction; and even the most solid and best conducted institutions of\r\nthe country were shaken by the fury of the explosion. Wool suddenly fell\r\nalmost fifty per cent. The grower began to be discouraged. The breeder\r\nof the delicate Saxons--and they comprised the flocks of nearly all the\r\nlarge wool-growers in the country, at that time--could not obtain for\r\nhis wool its actual first cost per pound.\r\n\r\nWhen the Saxon growers found that the tariff of 1842 brought them no\r\nrelief, they began to give up their costly and carefully nursed flocks.\r\nThe example once set, it became contagious; and then was a period when\r\nit seemed as if all the Saxon sheep of the country would be sacrificed\r\nto this reaction. Many abandoned wool-growing altogether, at a heavy\r\nsacrifice of their fixtures for rearing sheep; others crossed with\r\ncoarse-woolled breeds; and, rushing from one extreme to the other, some\r\neven crossed with the English mutton breeds; or some, with more\r\njudgment, went back to the parent Merino stock, but usually selected the\r\nheaviest and coarsest-woolled Merinos, and thus materially deteriorated\r\nthe character of their wool. This period became distinguished by a mania\r\nfor heavy fleeces. The English crosses were, however, speedily\r\nabandoned. The Merino regained his supremacy, lost for nearly a quarter\r\nof a century, and again became the popular favorite. It was generally\r\nadopted by those who were commencing flocks in the new Western States,\r\nand gives its type to the sheep of those regions.\r\n\r\nThe supply of fine wool, then, proportionably decreased, and that of\r\nmedium and coarse increased. Wools, for convenience, may be classified\r\nas follows: _superfine_, the choicest quality grown in the United\r\nStates, and never grown here excepting in comparatively small\r\nquantities; _fine_, good ordinary Saxon; _good medium_, the highest\r\nquality of wool usually known in the market as Merino; _medium_,\r\nordinary Merino; _ordinary_, grade Merino and selected South-Down\r\nfleeces; and, _coarse_, the English long-wools, etc. This subdivision\r\nis, perhaps, minute enough for all practical purposes here.\r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent that, to sustain our manufacturing\r\ninterest--that engaged in the manufacture of fine cloths--the diminution\r\nof fine wools should not only be at once arrested, but that the growth\r\nof them should be immediately and largely increased. An increased\r\nattention was accordingly bestowed upon this branch of industry, and\r\nsections of the country which had previously held aloof from\r\nwool-growing, embarked in that calling with commendable enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe climate north of forty-one degrees, or, beyond all dispute, north\r\nof forty-two degrees, is too severe for any variety of sheep commonly\r\nknown, which bear either superfine or fine wools. In fact, the only such\r\nvariety in any thing like general use is the Saxon; and this, as has\r\nbeen remarked, is a delicate sheep, entirely incapable of safely\r\nwithstanding our northern winters, without good shelter, good and\r\nregularly-administered food, and careful and skilful management in all\r\nother particulars. When the season is a little more than usually\r\nback-hand, so that grass does not start prior to the lambing season, it\r\nis difficult to raise the lambs of the mature ewes; the young ewes will,\r\nin many instances, disown their lambs, or, if they own them, not have a\r\ndrop of milk for them; and if, under such circumstances, as often\r\nhappens, a northeast or a northwest storm comes driving down, bearing\r\nsnow or sleet in its wings, or there is a sudden depression of the\r\ntemperature from any cause, no care will save multitudes of lambs from\r\nperishing. If the time of having the lambs dropped is deferred, for the\r\npurpose of escaping these evils, they will not attain size and strength\r\nsufficient to enable them to pass safely through their first winter.\r\nNorth of the latitude last named, it is necessary, as a general rule,\r\nthat they be dropped in the first half of May, to give them this\r\nrequisite size and strength; and occasional cold storms come, nearly\r\nevery season, up to that period, and, not unfrequently, up to the first\r\nof June.\r\n\r\nThese considerations have had their weight even with the few large\r\nsheep-holders in that section, whose farms and buildings have been\r\narranged with exclusive reference to the rearing of these sheep; many of\r\nwhom have adopted a Merino cross. With the ordinary farmers--the small\r\nsheep-owners, who, in the aggregate, grow by far the largest portion of\r\nthe northern wools--the Saxon sheep is, for these reasons, in marked\r\ndisrepute. They have not the necessary fixtures for their winter\r\nprotection, and are unwilling to bestow the necessary amount of care on\r\nthem. Besides, mutton and wool being about an equal consideration with\r\nthis class, they want larger and earlier maturing breeds. Above all,\r\nthey want a strong, hardy sheep, which demands no more care than their\r\ncattle. The strong, compact, medium-woolled Merino, or, more generally,\r\nits crosses with coarse varieties, producing the wool classed as\r\nordinary, is the common favorite. In the Northwest, this is especially\r\nthe case, where the climate is still worse for delicate sheep.\r\n\r\nAt the South, on the contrary--where these disadvantages do not exist to\r\nso great an extent, certainly--wool varying from good medium upward are\r\nmore profitable staples for cultivation than the lower classes; and in\r\nthat section a high degree of fineness in fleece has been sought in\r\nbreeding the Merino--the four-pound fine-fleeced Merino having received\r\nmarked attention. This is a far more profitable animal than the Saxon,\r\nother things being equal--which is not the case, since the former is\r\nevery way a hardier animal and a better nurse; and, although about\r\ntwenty pounds heavier, and therefore consuming more feed, this\r\nadditional expense is more than counterbalanced by the additional care\r\nand risk attending the husbandry of the Saxon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF THE MERINO.\r\n\r\nFor breeding purposes, the shape and general appearance of the Merino\r\nshould be as follows:--The head should be well carried up, and in the\r\newe hornless. It would be better, on many accounts, to have the ram\r\nalso hornless, but, as horns are usually characteristic of the Merino\r\nram, many prefer to see them. The face should be rather short, broad\r\nbetween the eyes, the nose pointed, and, in the ewe, fine and free\r\nfrom wrinkles. The eye should be bright, moderately prominent, and\r\ngentle in its expression. The neck should be straight--not curving\r\ndownward--short, round, and stout--particularly so at its junction with\r\nthe shoulder, forward of the upper point of which it should not sink\r\nbelow the level of the back. The points of the shoulder should not rise\r\nto any perceptible extent above the level of the back. The back, to\r\nthe hips, should be straight; the crops--that portion of the body\r\nimmediately back of the shoulder-blades--full; the ribs well arched; the\r\nbody large and capacious; the flank well let down; the hind-quarters\r\nfull and round--the flesh meeting well down between the thighs, or in\r\nthe \"twists.\" The bosom should be broad and full; the legs short, well\r\napart, and perpendicular--that is, not drawn under the body toward each\r\nother when the sheep is standing. Viewed as a whole, the Merino should\r\npresent the appearance of a low, stout, plump, and--though differing\r\nessentially from the English mutton-sheep model--a highly symmetrical\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nThe skin is an important point. It should be loose, singularly mellow,\r\nand of a rich, delicate pink color. A colorless skin, or one of a tawny,\r\napproaching to a butternut, hue, indicates bad breeding. On the subject\r\nof wrinkles, there is a difference of opinion. As they are rather\r\ncharacteristic of the Merino--like the black color in a Berkshire hog,\r\nor the absence of all color in Durham cattle--these wrinkles have been\r\nmore regarded, by novices, than those points which give actual value to\r\nthe animal; and shrewd breeders have not been slow to act upon this\r\nhint. Many have contended that more wool can be obtained from a wrinkled\r\nskin; and this view of the case has led both the Spanish and French\r\nbreeders to cultivate them largely--the latter, to a monstrosity. An\r\nexceedingly wrinkled neck, however, adds but little to the weight of the\r\nfleece--not enough, in fact, to compensate for the deformity, and the\r\ngreat impediment thus placed in the way of the shearer. A smoothly drawn\r\nskin, and the absence of all dead lap, would not, on the other hand,\r\nperhaps be desirable.\r\n\r\nThe wool should densely cover the whole body, where it can possibly\r\ngrow--from a point between and a little below the eyes, and well up on\r\nthe cheeks, to the knees and hocks. Short wool may show, particularly in\r\nyoung animals, on the legs, even below the knees and hocks; but long\r\nwool covering the legs, and on the nose, below the eyes, is unsightly,\r\nwithout value; while on the face it frequently impedes the sight of the\r\nanimal, causing it to be in a state of perpetual alarm, and\r\ndisqualifying it to escape real danger. Neither is this useless wool the\r\nslightest indication of a heavy fleece--contrary to what seems to be\r\nthought by some. It is very often seen in Saxons shearing scarcely two\r\npounds of wool, and on the very lightest fleeced Merinos.\r\n\r\nThe amount of gum which the wool should exhibit is another mooted point.\r\nMerino wool should be yolky, or oily, prior to washing--though not to\r\nthe extreme extent, occasionally witnessed, of giving it the appearance\r\nof being saturated with grease. The extreme tips may exhibit a\r\nsufficient trace of gum to give the fleece a darkish cast, particularly\r\nin the ram; but a black, pitchy gum, resembling half-hardened tar,\r\nextending an eighth or a quarter of an inch into the fleece, and which\r\ncannot be removed by ordinary washing, is decidedly objectionable. There\r\nis a white or yellowish concrete gum, not removable by common washing,\r\nwhich appears in the interior of some fleeces, and is equally\r\nobjectionable.\r\n\r\nThe weight of fleece remaining the same, medium length of staple, with\r\ncompactness, is preferable to long, open wool, since it constitutes a\r\nbetter safeguard from inclemencies of weather, and better protects the\r\nanimal from the bad effects of cold and drenching rains in spring and\r\nfall. The wool should be, as nearly as possible, of even length and\r\nthickness over the entire body. Shortness on the flank, and shortness or\r\nthickness on the belly, are serious defects.\r\n\r\nEvenness of fleece is a point of the first importance. Many sheep\r\nexhibit good wool on the shoulder and side, while it is far coarser and\r\neven hairy on the thighs, dew-lap, etc. Rams of this stamp should not be\r\nbred from by any one aiming to establish a superior fine-woolled flock;\r\nand all such ewes should gradually be excluded from those selected for\r\nbreeding.\r\n\r\nThe style of the wool is a point of as much importance as mere fineness.\r\nSome very fine wool is stiff, and the fibres almost straight, like hair.\r\nIt has a dry, cottony look; and is a poor, unsalable article, however\r\nfine the fibre. Softness of wool--a delicate, silky, highly elastic feel\r\nbetween the fingers or on the lips, is the first thing to be regarded.\r\nThis is usually an index, or inseparable attendant, of the other good\r\nqualities; so much so, indeed, that an experienced judge can decide,\r\nwith little difficulty, between the quality of two fleeces, in the\r\ndark. Wool should be finely serrated, or crimped from one extremity to\r\nthe other: that is, it should present a regular series of minute curves;\r\nand, generally, the greater the number of these curves in a given\r\nlength, the higher the quality of the wool in all other particulars. The\r\nwool should open on the back of the sheep in connected masses, instead\r\nof breaking up into little round spiral ringlets of the size of a\r\npipe-stem, which indicate thinness of fleece; and when the wool is\r\npressed open each way with the hands, it should be close enough to\r\nconceal all but a delicate rose-colored line of skin. The interior of\r\nthe wool should be a pure, glittering white, with a lustre and\r\nliveliness of appearance not surpassed in the best silk.\r\n\r\nThe points in the form of the Merino which the breeder is called upon\r\nparticularly to avoid are, a long, thin head, narrow between the eyes; a\r\nthin, long neck, arching downward before the shoulders; narrow loins;\r\nflat ribs; steep, narrow hind-quarters; long legs; thighs scarcely\r\nmeeting at all; and legs drawn far under the body at the least approach\r\nof cold. All these points were, separately or conjointly, illustrated in\r\nmany of the Saxon flocks which have been swept from the country.\r\nSufficient attention has already been paid to the points to be avoided\r\nin the fleece.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING MERINOS.\r\n\r\nThe first great starting-point, among pure-blood animals, is, that \"like\r\nwill beget like.\" If the sire and ewe are perfect in any given points,\r\nthe offspring will generally be; if either is defective, the\r\noffspring--subject to a law which will possibly be noticed--will be\r\nhalf-way between the two; if both are defective in the same points,\r\nthe progeny will be more so than either of its parents--it will\r\ninherit the amount of defect in both parents added together. There are\r\nexceedingly few perfect animals. Breeding, therefore, is a system of\r\ncounterbalancing--breeding out--in the offspring, the defects of one\r\nparent, by the marked excellence of the other parent, in the same\r\npoints. The highest blood confers on the parent possessing it the\r\ngreatest power of stamping its own characteristics on its progeny; but,\r\nblood being the same, the male sheep possesses this power in a greater\r\ndegree than the female. We may, therefore, in the beginning, breed from\r\newes possessing any defects short of cardinal ones, without impropriety,\r\nprovided we possess the proper ram for that purpose; but, where a high\r\nstandard of quality is aimed at, all ewes possessing even considerable\r\ndefects should gradually be thrown out from breeding. Every year should\r\nadd to the vigor of the selection.\r\n\r\nBut, from the beginning--and at the beginning, more than at any other\r\ntime--the greatest care should be evinced in the selection of the ram.\r\nIf he has a defect, that defect is to be inherited by the whole future\r\nflock; if it is a material one--as, for example, a hollow back, bad\r\ncross, or thin fleece, or a highly uneven fleece--the flock will be one\r\nof low quality and little value. If, on the other hand, he is perfect,\r\nthe defects in the female will be lessened, and gradually bred out. It\r\nbeing, however, difficult to find perfect rams, those should be taken\r\nwhich have the fewest and lightest defects, and none of these material,\r\nlike those just enumerated. These defects are to be met and\r\ncounterbalanced by the decided excellence--sometimes, indeed, running\r\ninto a fault--of the ewe, in the same points. If the ram, then, is a\r\nlittle too long-legged, the shortest-legged ewes should be selected for\r\nhim; if gummy, the dryest-woolled; if his fleece is a trifle below the\r\nproper standard of fineness--but he has been retained, as often happens,\r\nfor weight of fleece and general excellence--he is to be put to the\r\nfinest and lightest-fleeced ewes, and so on. With a selection of rams,\r\nthis system of counterbalancing would require but little skill, if each\r\nparent possessed only a single fault. If the ewe be a trifle too\r\nthin-fleeced, and good in all other particulars, it would require no\r\nnice judgment to decide that she should be bred to an uncommonly\r\nthick-fleeced ram. But most animals possess, to a greater or less\r\ndegree, several defects. To select so that every one of these in the\r\ndam shall meet its opposite in the male, and the contrary, requires not\r\nonly plentiful materials from which to select, but the keenest\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nAfter the breeder has successfully established his flock, and given them\r\nan excellent character, he soon encounters a serious evil. He must\r\n\"breed in-and-in,\" as it is called--that is, interbreed between animals\r\nmore or less nearly related in blood--or he must seek rams from other\r\nflocks, at the risk of losing or changing the distinctive character of\r\nhis flock, hitherto so carefully sought, and built up with so much\r\npainstaking. The opponents of in-and-in breeding contend that it renders\r\ndiseases and all other defects hereditary, and that it tends to decrease\r\nof size, debility, and a general breaking up of the constitution. Its\r\ndefenders, on the other hand, insist that, if the parents are perfectly\r\nhealthy, this mode does not, of itself, tend to any diminution of\r\nhealthfulness in the offspring; and they likewise claim--which must be\r\nconceded--that it enables the skilful breeder much more rapidly to\r\nbring his flock to a particular standard or model, and to keep it there\r\nmuch more easily--unless it be true that, in course of time, they will\r\ndwindle and grow feeble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SCOTCH SHEEP-DOG, OR COLLEY.]\r\n\r\nSo far as the effect on the constitution is concerned, both positions\r\nmay be, to a certain extent, true. But it is, perhaps, difficult always\r\nto decide with certainty when an animal is not only free from disease,\r\nbut from all tendency or predisposition towards it. A brother or sister\r\nmay be apparently healthy--may be actually so--but may still possess a\r\npeculiarity of individual conformation which, under certain\r\ncircumstances, will manifest itself. If these circumstances do not\r\nchance to occur, they may live until old age, apparently possessing a\r\nrobust constitution. If tried together, their offspring--by a rule\r\nalready laid down--will possess this individual tendency in a double\r\ndegree. If the ram be interbred with sisters, half-sisters, daughters,\r\ngranddaughters, etc., for several generations, the predisposition toward\r\na particular disease--in the first place slight, now strong, and\r\nconstantly growing stronger--will pervade, and become radically\r\nincorporated into, the constitution of the whole flock. The first time\r\nthe requisite exciting causes are brought to bear, the disease breaks\r\nout, and, under such circumstances, with peculiar severity and\r\nmalignancy. If it be of a fatal character, the flock is rapidly swept\r\naway; if not, it becomes chronic, or periodical at frequently recurring\r\nintervals. The same remarks apply, in part, to those defects of the\r\noutward form which do not at first, from their slightness, attract the\r\nnotice of the ordinary breeder. They are rapidly increased until, almost\r\nbefore thought of by the owner, they destroy the value of the sheep.\r\nThat such are the common effects of in-and-in breeding, with such skill\r\nas it is commonly conducted, all know who have given attention to the\r\nsubject; and for these reasons the system is regarded with decided\r\ndisapprobation and repugnance by nine out of ten of the best practical\r\nfarmers.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-breeder can, however, avoid the effects of in-and-in breeding,\r\nand at the same time preserve the character of his flock, by seeking\r\nrams of the same breed, possessing, as nearly as possible, _the\r\ncharacteristics which he wishes to preserve in his own flock_. If this\r\nrule is neglected--if he draws indiscriminately from all the different\r\nvarieties or families of a breed--some large, and some small--some\r\nlong-woolled, and some short-woolled--some medium, and some superfine in\r\nquality--some tall, and some squatty--some crusted over with black gum,\r\nand some entirely free from it--breeding will become a mere matter of\r\nhap-hazard, and no certain or uniform results can be expected. So many\r\nvarieties cannot be fused into one for a number of generations--as is\r\nevidenced by the want of uniformity in the Rambouillet flock, which was\r\ncommenced by a promiscuous admixture of all the Spanish families; and it\r\nnot merely happens, as between certain classes of Saxons, that\r\nparticular families can never be successfully amalgamated.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the breeder has reached no satisfactory standard--if his\r\nsheep are deficient in the requisites which he desires--he is still to\r\nadhere to the breed--_provided the desired requisites are characteristic\r\nof the breed he possesses_--and select better animals to improve his own\r\ninferior ones. If he has, for instance, an inferior flock of\r\nSouth-Downs, and wishes to obtain the qualities of the best Down dams,\r\nhe should seek for the best rams of that breed. But if he wishes to\r\nobtain qualities _not characteristic of the breed he possesses_, he must\r\ncross with a breed which does possess them. If the possessor of\r\nSouth-Downs wishes to convert them into a fine-woolled sheep similar to\r\nthe Merino, he should cross his flock steadily with Merino\r\nrams--constantly increasing the amount of Merino, and diminishing the\r\namount of South-Down blood. To effect the same result, he would take the\r\nsame course with the common sheep of the country, or with any other\r\ncoarse race.\r\n\r\nThere are those, who, forgetting that some of the finest varieties now\r\nin existence, of several kinds of domestic animals, are the result of\r\ncrosses--bitterly inveigh against the practice of crossing, under any\r\nand all circumstances. It is, it must be admitted, an unqualified\r\nabsurdity, as frequently conducted--as, for example, an attempt to unite\r\nthe fleece of a Merino and the carcass of a Leicester, by crosses\r\nbetween those breeds; but, under the limitations already laid down, and\r\nwith the objects specified as legitimate ones, this objection to\r\ncrossing savors of the most profound prejudice, or the most unblushing\r\nquackery. It is neither convenient, nor within the means of every man\r\nwishing to start a flock of sheep, to commence exclusively with\r\nfull-bloods. With a few to breed rams from, and to begin a full-blood\r\nstock, the breeder will find it his best policy to purchase the best\r\ncommon sheep of his country, and gradually grade them up with Merino\r\nrams. In selecting the ewes, good shape, fair size, and a robust\r\nconstitution, are the main points--the little difference in the quality\r\nof the common sheep's wool being of no consequence. For their wool, they\r\nare to look to the Merino; but good form and constitution they can and\r\nought to possess, so as not to entail deep-rooted and entirely\r\nunnecessary evils on their progeny.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory results have followed crossing a Down ram--small, compact,\r\nexceedingly beautiful, fine and even fleeced--with large-sized Merino\r\newes. The half-blood ewes were then bred to a Merino ram, and also their\r\nfemale progeny, and so on. The South-Downs, from a disposition to take\r\non fat, manifested themselves, to a perceptible extent, in every\r\ngeneration, and the wool of many of the sheep in the third\r\ngeneration--seven-eighths blood Merino, and one-eighth blood Down--was\r\nvery even, and equal to medium, and some of them to good medium Merino.\r\nTheir fleeces were lighter than the full-blood Merinos, but increased in\r\nweight with each succeeding cross back toward the latter. The mutton of\r\nthe first, and even of the second cross was of a beautiful flavor, and\r\nretained, to the last, some of the superiority of South-Down mutton.\r\n\r\nResults are also noted of breeding Leicester ewes--taking one cross of\r\nthe blood, as in the preceding case--toward the Merino. The mongrels, to\r\nthe second generation--beyond which they were not bred--were about\r\nmidway between the parent stock in size--with wool shorter, but far more\r\nfine and compact than the Leicester--their fleeces about the same\r\nweight, five pounds--and, altogether, they were a showy and profitable\r\nsheep, and well calculated to please the mass of farmers. Their fleeces,\r\nhowever, lacked evenness, their thighs remaining disproportionately\r\ncoarser and heavy.\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion exists in relation to the number of crosses\r\nnecessary before it is proper to breed from a mongrel ram. Some high\r\nauthorities assert that it does not admit of the slightest doubt that a\r\nMerino, in the fourth generation, from even the worst-woolled ones, is\r\nin every respect equal to the stock of the sire--that no difference need\r\nto be made in the choice of a ram, whether he is a full-blood, or a\r\nfifteen-sixteenths--and that, however coarse the fleece of the parent\r\newe may have been, the progeny in the fourth generation will not show\r\nit.\r\n\r\nOthers, however--while admitting that the only value of blood or\r\npedigree, in breeding, is to insure the hereditary transmission of the\r\nproperties of the parent to the offspring, and that, as soon as a\r\nmongrel reaches the point where he stamps his characteristics on the\r\nprogeny, with the same certainty that a full-blood does, he is equally\r\nvaluable, provided he is, individually, as perfect an animal--contend\r\nthat this cannot be depended upon, with any certainty, in rams of the\r\nfourth Merino cross. They assert that the offspring of such crosses\r\ninvariably lack the style and perfection of thorough-bred flocks. The\r\nsixth, seventh, or eighth cross might be generally, and the last,\r\nperhaps, almost invariably, as good as pure-blood rams; yet pure blood\r\nis a fixed standard, and were every breeder to think himself at liberty\r\nto depart from it in his rams, each one more or less, according to his\r\njudgment or caprice, the whole blood of the country would become\r\nadulterated. No man, assuredly, can be authorized to sell a ram of any\r\ncross, whether the tenth, or even the twentieth, as a full-blood.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance for those _commencing_ flocks, either of\r\nfull-bloods, or by crossing, to select the choicest rams. A grown ram\r\nmay, by methods which will hereafter be described, be made to serve from\r\none hundred to one hundred and fifty ewes in a season. A good Merino ram\r\nwill, moderately speaking, add more than a pound of wool to the fleece\r\nof the dam, or every lamb got by it, from a common-woolled ewe--that is,\r\nif the ewe at three years old sheared three pounds of wool, the lamb at\r\nthe same age will shear four. This would give one hundred or one hundred\r\nand fifty pounds of wool for the use of a ram for a single season; and\r\nevery lamb subsequently got by him adds a pound to this amount. Many a\r\nram gets, during his life, eight hundred or one thousand lambs. Nor is\r\nthe extra amount of wool all. He gets from eight hundred to one thousand\r\nhalf-blooded sheep, worth double their dams, and ready to be made the\r\nbasis of another and higher stride in improvement. A good ram, then, is\r\nas important and, it may be, quite as valuable an animal as a good\r\nfarm-horse stallion. When the number of a ram's progeny are taken into\r\nconsideration, and when it is seen over what an immense extent, even in\r\nhis own direct offspring, his good or bad qualities are to be\r\nperpetuated, the folly of that economy which would select an inferior\r\nanimal is sufficiently obvious.\r\n\r\nIt will be found the best economy in starting a flock, where the proper\r\nflocks from which to draw rams are not convenient, to purchase several\r\nof the same breed, of course, but _of different strains of blood_. Thus\r\nram No. 2 can be put on the offspring of No. 1, and the reverse; No. 3\r\ncan be put on the offspring of both, and both upon the offspring of No.\r\n3. The changes which can be rung on three distinct strains of blood,\r\nwithout in-and-in breeding close enough to be attended with any\r\nconsiderable danger, are innumerable.\r\n\r\nThe brother and sister, it will be born in mind, are of the same blood;\r\nthe father and daughter, half; the father and granddaughter, one-fourth;\r\nthe father and great-granddaughter, one-eighth; and so on. Breeding\r\nbetween animals possessing one-eighth of the same blood, would not be\r\nconsidered very close breeding; and it is not unusual, in rugged,\r\nwell-formed families, to breed between those possessing one-fourth of\r\nthe same blood.\r\n\r\nIf, however, these rams of different strains are brought promiscuously,\r\nwithout reference to similarity of characteristics, there may, and\r\nprobably will, be difference between them; and it might require time and\r\nskill to give a flock descended from them a proper uniformity of\r\ncharacter. Those who breed rams for sale should be prepared to furnish\r\ndifferent strains of blood, with the necessary individual and family\r\nuniformity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL PRINCIPLES OF BREEDING.\r\n\r\nSome few suggestions upon the general principles to be observed in\r\nbreeding may not be superfluous here, referring the reader, who is\r\ndisposed to investigate this subject in detail, to its full discussion\r\nin the author's treatise upon \"Cattle and their Diseases.\"\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the importance of _breeding only from the best_,\r\ntaking care to avoid structural defects, and especially to secure\r\nfreedom from _hereditary diseases_, since both defects and diseases\r\nappear to be more easily transmissible than desirable qualities, it may\r\nbe remarked that scrofula is not uncommon among sheep, and presents\r\nitself in various forms. Sometimes it is connected with consumption;\r\nsometimes it affects the viscera of the abdomen, and particularly the\r\nmesenteric glands, in a manner similar to consumption in the lungs. The\r\nscrofulous taint has been known to be so strong as to affect the\r\nf[oe]tus, and lambs have occasionally been dropped with it; but much\r\noftener they show it at an early age, and any affected in this way are\r\nliable to fall an easy prey to any ordinary or prevalent disease, which\r\ndevelops in such with unusual severity. Sheep are also liable to several\r\ndiseases of the brain, and of the respiratory and digestive organs.\r\nEpilepsy, or \"fits,\" and rheumatism sometimes occur.\r\n\r\nThe breeder's aim should be to grasp and _render permanent_, and\r\nincrease so far as practicable, _every variation for the better_, and to\r\nreject for breeding purposes such as show a downward tendency. A\r\nremarkable instance of the success which has often attended the\r\nwell-directed efforts of intelligent breeders, is furnished in the new\r\nMauchamp-Merino sheep, which originated in a single animal--a product of\r\nthe law of variation--and which, by skilful breeding and selection, has\r\nbecome an established breed of a peculiar type, and possessing valuable\r\nproperties. Samples of the wool of these sheep were shown at the great\r\nexhibition in London, in 1851, as well as at the subsequent great\r\nagricultural exhibition at Paris, and attracted much attention.\r\n\r\nThis breed was originated by Mons. J. L. Graux. In 1828, a Merino ewe\r\nproduced a peculiar ram lamb, having a different shape from the ordinary\r\nMerino, and possessing wool singularly long, straight, and silky. Two\r\nyears afterward, Mr. Graux obtained by this ram one ram and one ewe,\r\nhaving the silky character of wool. Among the produce of the ensuing\r\nyear were four rams and one ewe with similar fleeces; and in 1833, there\r\nwere rams enough of the new sort to serve the whole flock of ewes. In\r\neach subsequent year, the lambs were of two kinds; one possessing the\r\ncurled, elastic wool of the old Merinos, only a little longer and finer,\r\nand the other like the new breed. At last, the skilful breeder obtained\r\na flock containing the fine, silky fleece with a smaller breed, broader\r\nflanks, and more capacious chest; and several flocks being crossed with\r\nthe Mauchamp variety, the Mauchamp-Merino breed is the result.\r\n\r\nThe pure Mauchamp wool is remarkable for its qualities as a\r\ncombing-wool, owing to the strength, as well as the length and fineness\r\nof the fibre. It is found of great value by the manufacturers of\r\nCashmere shawls, and similar goods, being second only to the true\r\nCashmere fleece, in the fine, flexible delicacy of the fibre; and when\r\nin combination with Cashmere wool, imparting strength and consistency.\r\nThe quantity of this wool has since become as great as that from\r\nordinary Merinos, or greater, while its quality commands twenty-five per\r\ncent. higher price in the French market. Breeders, certainly, cannot\r\nwatch too closely any accidental peculiarity of conformation or\r\ncharacteristic in their flocks.\r\n\r\n_The apparent influence of the male_ first having fruitful intercourse\r\nwith a female, _upon her subsequent offspring by other males_, has been\r\nnoticed by various writers. The following well-authenticated instances\r\nare in point:\r\n\r\nA small flock of ewes, belonging to Dr. W. Wells, in the island of\r\nGranada, was served by a ram procured for the purpose. The ewes were all\r\nwhite and woolly; the ram was quite different, being of a chocolate\r\ncolor, and hairy like a goat. The progeny were, of course, crosses, but\r\nbore a strong resemblance to the male parent. The next season, Dr. Wells\r\nobtained a ram of precisely the same breed as the ewes; but the progeny\r\nshowed distinct marks of resemblance to the former ram, in color and\r\ncovering. The same thing occurred on neighboring estates, under like\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nSix very superior pure-bred black-faced horned ewes, belonging to Mr. H.\r\nShaw, of Leochel, Cushnie, were served by a white-faced hornless\r\nLeicester ram. The lambs were crosses. The next year they were served by\r\na ram of exactly the same breed as the ewes themselves, and their lambs\r\nwere, without an exception, hornless and brownish in the face, instead\r\nof being black and horned. The third year they were again served by a\r\nsuperior ram of their own breed; and again the lambs were mongrels, but\r\nshowed less of the Leicester characteristics than before; and Mr. Shaw\r\nat last parted from these fine ewes without obtaining a single pure-bred\r\nlamb.\r\n\r\nTo account for this result--seemingly regarded by most physiologists as\r\ninexplicable--Mr. James McGillivray, V. S., of Huntley, has offered an\r\nexplanation, which has received the sanction of a number of competent\r\nwriters. His theory is, that when a pure animal of any breed has been\r\npregnant by an animal of a different breed, such pregnant animal _is a\r\ncross ever after_, the purity of her blood being lost, in consequence of\r\nher connection with the foreign animal, and herself becoming a cross\r\nforever, incapable of producing a pure calf of any breed.\r\n\r\nTo cross, _merely for the sake of crossing_, to do so without that care\r\nand vigilance which are highly essential, is a practice which cannot be\r\ntoo much condemned, being, in fact, a national evil, if pushed to such\r\nan extent as to do away with a useful breed of animals, and establish a\r\ngeneration of mongrels in their place--a result which has followed in\r\nnumerous instances amongst every breed of animals.\r\n\r\nThe principal use of crossing is to raise animals for the butcher. The\r\nmale, being generally an animal of a superior breed, and of a vigorous\r\nnature, almost invariably stamps his external form, size, and muscular\r\ndevelopment on the offspring, which thus bear a strong resemblance to\r\nhim; while their internal nature, derived from the dam, well adapts them\r\nto the locality, as well as to the treatment to which their dams have\r\nbeen accustomed.\r\n\r\nWith sheep, where the peculiarities of the soil, as regards the goodness\r\nof feed, and exposure to the severities of the weather, often prevent\r\nthe introduction of an improved breed, the value of using a new and\r\nsuperior ram is often very considerable; and the weight of mutton is\r\nthereby materially increased, without its quality being impaired, while\r\nearlier maturity is at the same time obtained. It involves, however,\r\nmore systematic attention than most farmers usually like to bestow, for\r\nit is necessary to employ a different ram for each purpose; that is, a\r\nnative ram, for a portion of the ewes to keep up the purity of the\r\nbreed, and a foreign ram, to raise the improved cross-bred animals for\r\nfelting, either as lambs or sheep. This plan is adopted by many breeders\r\nof Leicester sheep, who thus employ South-Down rams to improve the\r\nquality of the mutton.\r\n\r\nOne inconvenience attending this plan is the necessity of fattening the\r\nmaiden ewes as well as the wethers. They may, however, be disposed of as\r\nfat lambs, or the practice of spaying (fully explained in \"Cattle and\r\ntheir Diseases\") might be adopted, so as to increase the felting\r\ndisposition of the animal. Crossing, therefore, should be adopted with\r\nthe greatest caution and skill, where the object is to improve the breed\r\nof animals. It should never be practised carelessly or capriciously, but\r\nit may be advantageously pursued, with a view to raising superior and\r\nprofitable animals for the butcher. For the latter purpose, it is\r\ngenerally advisable to use males of a larger breed, provided they\r\npossess a disposition to fatten; yet, in such cases, it is of importance\r\nthat the _pelvis_ of the female should be wide and capacious, so that no\r\ninjury may arise in lambing, in consequence of the increased size of the\r\nheads of the lambs. The shape of the ram's head should be studied for\r\nthe same reason.\r\n\r\nIn crossing, however, for the purpose of establishing a new breed, the\r\nsize of the male must give way to other more important considerations;\r\nalthough it will still be desirable to use a large female of the breed\r\nwhich is sought to be improved. Thus, the South-Downs have vastly\r\nimproved the larger Hampshires, and the Leicester, the huge Lincolns and\r\nthe Cotswolds.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF RAMS.\r\n\r\nMerino rams are frequently used from the first to the tenth year, and\r\neven longer. The lambs of very old rams are commonly supposed not to be\r\nas those of middle-aged ones; though where rams have not been\r\novertasked, and have been properly fed, little if any difference is\r\ndiscoverable in their progeny by reason of their sire's age. A ram lamb\r\nshould not be used, as it retards his growth, injures his form, and, in\r\nmany instances, permanently impairs his vigor and courage. A yearling\r\nmay run with thirty ewes, a two-year-old with from forty to fifty, and a\r\nthree-year-old with from fifty to sixty; while some very powerful,\r\nmature rams will serve seventy or eighty. Fifty, however, is enough,\r\nwhere they _run with_ the ewes. It is well settled that an impoverished\r\nand overtasked animal does not transmit his individual properties so\r\ndecidedly to his offspring as does one in full vigor.\r\n\r\nRams, of course, are not to be selected for ewes by mere chance, but\r\naccording as their qualities may improve those of the ewes. It may not\r\nbe superfluous, though seemingly a repetition, to state that a good ewe\r\nflock should exhibit these characteristics: _strong bone_, supporting a\r\nroomy frame, affording space for a large development of flesh;\r\n_abundance of wool of a good quality_, keeping the ewes warm in\r\ninclement weather, and insuring profit to the breeder; _a disposition to\r\nfatten early_, enabling the breeder readily to get rid of his sheep\r\nselected for the butcher; and _a prolific tendency_, increasing the\r\nflock rapidly, and being also a source of profit. Every one of these\r\nproperties is advantageous in itself; but when all are combined in the\r\nsame individuals of a flock, that flock is in a high state of\r\nperfection. In selecting rams, it should be observed whether or not they\r\npossess one or more of those qualities in which the ewes may be\r\ndeficient, in which case their union with the ewes will produce in the\r\nprogeny a higher degree of perfection than is to be found in the ewes\r\nthemselves, and such a result will improve the state of the future\r\newe-flock; but, on the contrary, if the ewes are superior in all points\r\nto the rams, then, of course, the use of such will only serve to\r\ndeteriorate the future ewe-flock.\r\n\r\nSeveral rams running in the same flock excite each other to an unnatural\r\nand unnecessary activity, besides injuring each other by constant blows.\r\nIt is, in every point of view, bad husbandry, where it can be avoided,\r\nand, as customarily managed, is destructive to every thing like careful\r\nand judicious breeding. The nice adaptation which the male should\r\npossess to the female is out of the question where half a dozen or more\r\nrams are running promiscuously with two or three hundred ewes.\r\n\r\nBefore the rams are let out, the breeding ewes should all be brought\r\ntogether in one yard; the form of each noted, together with the length,\r\nthickness, quality and style of her wool--ascertained by opening the\r\nwool on the shoulder, thigh, and belly. When every point is thus\r\ndetermined, that ram should be selected which, on the whole, is best\r\ncalculated to perpetuate the excellencies of each, both of fleece and\r\ncarcass, and to best counterbalance defects in the mutual offspring.\r\nEvery ewe, when turned in with the ram, should be given a distinct mark,\r\nwhich will continue visible until the next shearing. For this purpose,\r\nnothing is better than Venetian red and hog's lard, well incorporated,\r\nand marked on with a cob. The ewes for each ram require a differently\r\nshaped mark, and the mark should also be made on the ram, as noted in\r\nthe sheep-book. Thus it can be determined at a glance by what ram the\r\newe was tapped, any time before the next shearing. The ewes selected for\r\neach ram are placed in different enclosures, and the chosen ram placed\r\nwith them. Rams require but little preparation on being put among ewes.\r\nIf their skin is red in the flanks when the sheep are turned up, they\r\nare ready for the ewes, for the natural desire is then upon them. Most\r\nof the ewes will be served during the second week the ram is among them,\r\nand in the third, all. It is better, however, not to withdraw the rams\r\nuntil the expiration of four weeks, when the flocks can be doubled, or\r\notherwise re-arranged for winter, as may be necessary. The trouble thus\r\ntaken is, in reality, slight--nothing, indeed, when the beneficial\r\nresults are considered. With two assistants, several hundred ewes may be\r\nproperly classified and divided in a single day.\r\n\r\nWhere choice rams are scarce, so that it is desirable to make the\r\nservices of one go a great way, or where it is impossible to have\r\nseparate enclosures--as on farms where there are a great number of\r\nbreeding ewes, or where the shepherd system is adopted, to the exclusion\r\nof fences--resort may be had to another method. A hut should be built,\r\ncontaining as many apartments as the ram is desired to be used, with an\r\nalley between them, each apartment to be furnished with a feeding-box\r\nand trough in one corner, and gates or bars opening from each into the\r\nalley, and at each end of the alley. Adjoining these apartments, a yard\r\nshould be inclosed, of size just sufficient to hold the flock of\r\nbreeding ewes.\r\n\r\nA couple of strong rams, of any quality, for about every hundred ewes,\r\nare then aproned, their briskets rubbed with Venetian red and hog's\r\nlard, and let loose among the ewes. _Aproning_ is performed by sewing a\r\nbelt of coarse sacking, broad enough to extend from the fore to the hind\r\nlegs, loosely but strongly around the body. To prevent its slipping\r\nforward or back, straps are carried round the breast and back of the\r\nbreech. It should be made _perfectly secure_, or all the labor of this\r\nmethod of coupling will be far worse than thrown away. The pigment on\r\nthe brisket should be renewed every two or three days; and it will be\r\nnecessary to change the \"teasers\"--as these aproned rams are\r\ncalled--about once a week, as they do not long retain their courage\r\nunder such unnatural circumstances. Twice a day the ewes are brought\r\ninto the yard in front of the hut. Those marked on their rumps by the\r\nteasers are taken into the alley. Each is admitted _once_ to the ram for\r\nwhich she is marked, and then goes out _at the opposite end of the\r\nalley_ from which they entered, into a field separate from that\r\ncontaining the flock from which she was taken. A powerful and vigorous\r\nram, from three to seven years old, and properly fed, can thus be made\r\nto serve from one hundred and fifty to even two hundred ewes, with no\r\ngreater injury than from running loose with fifty or sixty. The labor\r\nhere required is likewise more apparent than real, when the operation is\r\nconducted in a systematic manner.\r\n\r\nRams will do better, accomplish more, and last two or three years\r\nlonger, if daily fed with grain, when on service, and it is better to\r\ncontinue it. In all cases, they should, after serving, be put on good\r\npasture, as they will have lost a good deal of condition, being\r\nindisposed to settle during the tapping season. A ram should receive\r\nthe equivalent of from half a pint to a pint of oats daily, when worked\r\nhard. They are much more conveniently fed when kept in huts. If suffered\r\nto run at large, they should be so thoroughly tamed that they will eat\r\nfrom a measure held by the shepherd. Careful breeders thus train their\r\nstock-rams, from the time they are lambs. It is very convenient, also,\r\nto have them halter-broke, so that they can be led about without\r\ndragging or lifting them. An iron ring attached to one of the horns,\r\nnear the point, to which a cord can be fastened for leading, confining,\r\netc., is very useful and convenient. If rams are wild, it is a matter of\r\nconsiderable difficulty to feed them separately, and it can only be\r\neffected by yarding the flock and catching them out. Some breeders, in\r\naddition to extra feeding, take the rams out of the flocks each night,\r\nshutting them up in a barn or stable by themselves. To this practice\r\nthere is no objection, and it greatly saves their strength.\r\n\r\nRams should not be suffered to run with the ewes over a month, at least\r\nin the Northern States. It is much better that a ewe go dry than that\r\nshe have a lamb later than the first of June. Besides, after the rutting\r\nseason is over, the rams grow cross, frequently striking the pregnant\r\newes dangerous blows with their heavy horns, at the racks and troughs.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonably enough conjectured, that if procreation and the first\r\nperiod of gestation take place in cold weather, the f[oe]tus will be\r\nfitted for the climate which rules during the early stages of its\r\nexistence. If this be so--and it is certainly in accordance with the\r\nlaws of Nature--fine-woolled sheep are most likely to maintain their\r\nexcellence by deferring the connection of the male till the commencement\r\nof cold weather; and, in the Northern States, this is done about the\r\nfirst of December, thus bringing the yeaning time in the last of April,\r\nor the first of May, when the early grass affords a large supply and\r\ngood quality of food.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMBING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EWE AND LAMBS.]\r\n\r\nThe ewe goes with young about five months, varying from one hundred and\r\nforty-five to one hundred and sixty-two days. Pregnant ewes require the\r\nsame food as at all other times. Until two or three weeks preceding\r\nlambing, it is only necessary that they, like other store-sheep, be kept\r\nin good, plump, ordinary condition; nor are any separate arrangements\r\nnecessary for them after that period, in a climate where they obtain\r\nsufficient succulent food to provide for a proper secretion of milk. In\r\nbackward seasons in the North, where the grass does not start prior to\r\nthe lambing-time, careful farmers feed their ewes on chopped roots, or\r\nroots mixed with oat and pea-meal, which is excellent economy. Caution\r\nis, however, necessary to prevent injury or abortion, which is often\r\nthe result of excessive fat, feebleness, or disease. The first may be\r\nremedied by blood-letting and spare diet; and both the last by restored\r\nhealth and generous food. Sudden frights, as from dogs or strange\r\nobjects; long or severe journeys, great exertions, unwholesome food,\r\nblows in the region of the f[oe]tus, and some other causes, produce\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\nLambs are usually dropped, in the North, from the first to the fifteenth\r\nof May; in the South, they can safely come earlier. It is not expedient\r\nto have them dropped when the weather is cold or boisterous, as they\r\nrequire too much care; but the sooner the better, after the weather has\r\nbecome mild, and the herbage has started sufficiently to give the ewes\r\nthat green food which is required to produce a plentiful secretion of\r\nmilk. It is customary, in the North, to have fields of clover, or the\r\nearliest grasses, reserved for the early spring-feed of the\r\nbreeding-ewes; and, if these can be contiguous to their stables, it is a\r\ngreat convenience--for the ewes should be confined in the latter, on\r\ncold and stormy nights, during the lambing season.\r\n\r\nIf the weather be warm and pleasant, and the nights moderately warm, it\r\nis better to have the lambing take place in the pasture; since sheep are\r\nthen more disposed to own their lambs, and take kindly to them, than in\r\nthe confusion of a small inclosure. In the latter, sheep, unless\r\nparticularly docile, crowd from one side to another when any one enters,\r\nrunning over young lambs, pressing them severely, etc.; ewes become\r\nseparated from their lambs, and then run violently round from one to\r\nanother, jostling and knocking them about; young and timid ewes, when so\r\nseparated, will frequently neglect their lambs for an hour or more\r\nbefore they will again approach them, while, if the weather is severely\r\ncold, the lamb, if it has never sucked, is in danger of perishing.\r\nLambs, too, when first dropped in a _dirty_ inclosure, tumble about, in\r\ntheir first efforts to rise, and the membrane which adheres to them\r\nbecomes smeared with dirt and dung; and the ewe's refusing to lick them\r\ndry much increases the hazard of freezing.\r\n\r\nIn cold storms, however, and in sudden and severe weather, all this must\r\nbe encountered; and, therefore, every shepherd should teach his sheep\r\ndocility. It requires but a very moderately cold night to destroy the\r\nnew-born Saxon lamb, which--the pure blood--is dropped nearly as naked\r\nas a child. During a severely cold period, of several days continuance,\r\nit is almost impossible to rear them, even in the best shelter. The\r\nMerino, South-Down, and some other breeds, will endure a greater degree\r\nof cold with impunity. Where inclosures are used for yeaning, they\r\nshould be kept clean by frequent litterings of straw--not enough,\r\nhowever, to be thrown on at any one time, to embarrass the lamb about\r\nrising.\r\n\r\nThe predisposing symptoms of lambing are, enlargement and reddening of\r\nthe parts under the tail, and drooping of the flanks. The more immediate\r\nare, when the ewe stretches herself frequently; separating herself from\r\nher companions; exhibiting restlessness by not remaining in one place\r\nfor any length of time; lying down and rising up again, as if\r\ndissatisfied with the place; pawing the ground with a forefoot;\r\nbleating, as if in quest of a lamb; and appearing fond of the lambs of\r\nother ewes. In a very few hours, or even shorter time after the\r\nexhibition of these symptoms, the immediate symptom of lambing is the\r\nexpulsion of the bag of water from the _vagina_. When this is observed,\r\nthe ewe should be narrowly watched, for the pains of labor may be\r\nexpected to come on immediately. When these are felt by her, the ewe\r\npresses or forces with earnestness, changing one place or position for\r\nanother, as if desirous of relief.\r\n\r\nThe ewe does not often require mechanical assistance in parturition. Her\r\nlabors will sometimes be prolonged for three or four hours, and her loud\r\nmoanings will evince the extent of her pain. Sometimes she will go about\r\nseveral hours, and even resume her grazing, with the fore-feet and nose\r\nof the lamb protruding at the mouth of the _vagina_. If let alone,\r\nhowever, Nature will generally relieve her. In case of a false\r\nparturition of the f[oe]tus--which is comparatively rare--the shepherd\r\nmay apply his thumb and finger, after oiling, to push back the lamb, and\r\nassist in gently turning it till the nose and fore-feet appear. Where\r\nfeebleness in expelling the f[oe]tus exists, only the slightest aid\r\nshould be rendered, and that to help the throes of the dam. The\r\nobjection to interfering--except as a last resort--is, that the ewe is\r\nfrightened when caught, and her efforts to expel the lamb cease. When\r\naided, in any case, the gentlest force should be applied, and only in\r\nconjunction with the efforts of the ewe. The clearing, or _placenta_,\r\ngenerally drops from the ewe in the course of a very short time--in many\r\ncases, within a few minutes--after lambing. It should be carried away,\r\nand not allowed to lie upon the lambing-pound.\r\n\r\nCommon kale, or curly-greens, is excellent food for ewes that have\r\nlambed, as its nutritive matter, being mucilaginous, is wholly soluble\r\nin water, and beneficial in encouraging the necessary discharges of the\r\newe at the time of lambing. In these respects, it is a better food than\r\nSwedish turnips--upon which sheep are sometimes fed--which become rather\r\ntoo fibrous and astringent, in spring, for the secretion of milk. In the\r\nabsence of kale or cabbage, a little oil-cake will aid the discharges\r\nand purify the body. New grass also operates medicinally upon the\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANAGEMENT OF LAMBS.\r\n\r\nWhile the lamb is tumbling about and attempting to rise--the ewe,\r\nmeanwhile, licking it dry--it is well to be in no haste to interfere. A\r\nlamb that gets at the teat without help, and procures even a small\r\nquantity of milk, knows how to help itself afterward, and rarely\r\nperishes. If helped, it sometimes continues to expect it, and will do\r\nlittle for itself for two or three days. The same is true where lambs\r\nare fed from a spoon or bottle.\r\n\r\nBut if the lamb ceases to make efforts to rise--especially if the ewe\r\nhas left off licking it while it is wet and chilly--it is time to render\r\nassistance. It is not advisable to throw the ewe down--as is frequently\r\npractised--in order to suckle the lamb; because instinct teaches the\r\nlatter to point its nose _upward_ in search of the teats. It is,\r\ntherefore, doubly difficult to teach it to suck from the bag of the\r\nprostrate ewe; and when it is taught to do this, by being so suckled\r\nseveral times, it is awkward about finding the teat in the natural\r\nposition, when it begins to stand and help itself. Carefully disengaging\r\nthe ewe from her companions, with his crook--which useful article will\r\nbe hereafter described--the assistant should place one hand before the\r\nneck and the other behind the buttocks of the ewe, and then, pressing\r\nher against his knees, he should hold her firmly and still, so that she\r\nwill not be constantly crowding away from the shepherd, who should set\r\nthe lamb on its feet, inducing it to stand, if possible; if not,\r\nsupporting it _on its feet_ by placing one hand under its body; put its\r\nmouth to the teat, and encourage it to suck by tickling it about the\r\nroots of the tail, flanks, etc., with a finger. The lamb, mistaking this\r\nlast for the caresses of its dam, will redouble its efforts to suck.\r\nSometimes it will manifest great dullness, and even apparent obstinacy,\r\nin refusing for a long time to attempt to assist itself, crowding\r\nbackward, etc.; but the kind and gentle shepherd, who will not sink\r\nhimself to the level of brute, by resenting the stupidity of a brute,\r\nwill generally carry the point by perseverance. Sometimes milking a\r\nlittle into the lamb's mouth, holding the latter close to the teat, will\r\ninduce it to take hold.\r\n\r\nIf the ewe has no milk, the lamb should be fed, until the natural supply\r\ncommences, with small quantities of the milk of a _new-milch_ cow. This\r\nshould be mixed, say half and half, with water, with enough molasses to\r\ngive it the purgative effect of the first milk, gently warmed to the\r\nnatural heat--not scalded and suffered to cool--and then fed through a\r\nbottle with a sponge in the opening of it, which the lamb should _suck_,\r\nif it can be induced so to do. If the milk is poured in its mouth from a\r\nspoon or bottle, it is frequently difficult, as before stated, to induce\r\nit to suck. Moreover, unless milk is poured into the mouth slowly and\r\nwith care--no faster than the lamb can swallow--a speedy wheezing, the\r\ninfallible precursor of death, will show that a portion of the fluid\r\nhas been forced into the lungs. Lambs have been frequently killed in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\nIf a lamb becomes chilled, it should be wrapped in a woollen blanket,\r\nplaced in a warm room, and given a little milk as soon as it will\r\nswallow. A trifle of pepper is sometimes placed in the milk, and\r\nwith good effect, for the purpose of rousing the cold and torpid\r\nstomach into action. In New England, under such circumstances, the lamb\r\nis sometimes \"baked,\" as it is called--that is, put in a blanket in a\r\nmoderately-heated oven, until warmth and animation are restored; others\r\nimmerse it in tepid water, and subsequently rub it dry, which is said to\r\nbe an excellent method where the lamb is nearly frozen. A good blanket\r\nhowever, a warm room, and sometimes, perhaps, a little gentle friction\r\nwill generally suffice.\r\n\r\nIf a strong ewe, with a good bag of milk, chance to lose her lamb, she\r\nshould be required to bring up one of some other ewe's twins, or the\r\nlamb of some feeble or young ewe, having an inadequate supply of milk.\r\nHer own lamb should be skinned as soon as possible after death, and the\r\nskin sewed over the lamb which she is to foster. She will sometimes be a\r\nlittle suspicious for a day or two; and if so, she should be kept in a\r\nsmall pen with the lamb, and occasionally looked to. After she has taken\r\nwell to it, the false skin may be removed in three or four days. If no\r\nlamb is placed on a ewe which lost her lamb, and which has a full bag of\r\nmilk, the milk should be drawn from the bag once or twice, or garget may\r\nensue; even if this is not the result, permanent indurations, or other\r\nresults of inflammatory action, will take place, injuring the subsequent\r\nnursing properties of the animal. When milked, it is well to wash the\r\nbag for some time in cold water, since it checks the subsequent\r\nsecretions of milk, as well as allays inflammation.\r\n\r\nSometimes a young ewe, though exhibiting sufficient fondness for her\r\nlamb, will not stand for it to suck; and in this case, if the lamb is\r\nnot very strong and persevering, and particularly if the weather is\r\ncold, it soon grows weak, and perishes. The conduct of the dam, in such\r\ninstances, is occasioned by inflammatory action about the bag or teats,\r\nand perhaps somewhat by the novelty of her position. In this case, the\r\nsheep should be caught and held until the lamb has exhausted her bag,\r\nand there will not often be any trouble afterward; though it may be well\r\nenough to keep them in a pen together until the fact is determined.\r\n\r\nSuch pens--necessary in a variety of cases other than those\r\nmentioned--need not exceed eight or ten feet square, and should be built\r\nof light materials, and fastened together at the corners, so that they\r\ncan be readily moved by one man, or, at the most, two, from place to\r\nplace, where they are wanted. Their position should be daily shifted,\r\nwhen sheep are in them, for cleanliness and fresh feed. Light pine poles\r\nlaid up like a fence, and each nailed and pegged to the lower ones at\r\nthe corners, or laid on, are quite serviceable. Two or three sides of a\r\nfew of them should be wattled with twigs, and the tops partly covered,\r\nin order to shield feeble lambs from cold rains, piercing winds, and the\r\nlike.\r\n\r\nYoung lambs are subject to what is commonly known as \"pinning\"--that is,\r\ntheir first excrements are so adhesive and tenacious that the orifice of\r\nthe anus is closed, and subsequent evacuations prevented. The adhering\r\nmatter, in such cases, should be entirely removed, and the part rubbed\r\nwith a little dry clay, to prevent subsequent adhesion. Lambs will\r\nfrequently perish from this cause, if not looked to for the first few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe ewes and their young ought to be divided into small flocks, and have\r\na frequent change of pasture. Some careful shepherds adopt the plan of\r\nconfining their lambs, allowing them to suck two or three times a day.\r\nBy this method they suffer no fatigue, and thrive much faster. It is,\r\nhowever, troublesome as well as injurious, since the exercise is\r\nessential to the health and constitution of the lamb intended for\r\nrearing. It is admissible only when they are wanted for an early market;\r\nand with those who rear them for this purpose it is a common practice.\r\n\r\nWhere there are orphans or supernumeraries in the flock, the deserted\r\nlambs must be brought up by hand. Such animals, called pet lambs, are\r\nsupported on cow's milk, which they receive warm from the cows each time\r\nthey are milked, and as much as they can drink. In the intervals of\r\nmeals, in bad weather, they are kept under cover; in good weather they\r\nare put into a grass enclosure during the day, and sheltered at night\r\nuntil the nights become warm. They are fed by hand out of a small\r\nvessel, which should contain as much milk as it is known each can drink.\r\nThey are first taught to drink out of the vessel with the fingers, like\r\na calf, and as soon as they can hold a finger steady in the mouth, a\r\nsmall tin tube, about three inches in length, and of the thickness of a\r\ngoose-quill, should be covered with several folds of linen, sewed\r\ntightly on, to use as a substitute for a teat, by means of which they\r\nwill drink their allowance of milk with great ease and quickness. A\r\ngoose-quill would answer the same purpose, were it not easily squeezed\r\ntogether by the mouth. When the same person feeds the lambs--and this\r\nshould be the dairy-maid--they soon become attached to her, and desire\r\nto follow her everywhere; but to prevent their bleating, and to make\r\nthem contented, an apron or a piece of cloth, hung on a stake or bush in\r\nthe inclosure, will keep them together.\r\n\r\nIt is much better for the lambs and for their dams that they be _weaned_\r\nfrom three and a half to four months old. When taken away, they should\r\nbe put for several days in a field distant from the ewes, that they may\r\nnot hear each other's bleatings, as the lambs, when in hearing of their\r\ndams, continue restless much longer, and make constant and, frequently,\r\nsuccessful efforts to crawl through the fences which separate them. One\r\nor two tame old ewes are turned into the field with them, to teach them\r\nto come at the call, find salt when thrown to them, and eat out of\r\ntroughs when winter approaches.\r\n\r\nWhen weaned, the lambs should be put on the freshest and tenderest\r\ngrass--rich, sweet food, but not too luxuriant. The grass and clover,\r\nsown the preceding spring, on grain-fields seeded down, is often\r\nreserved for them. The dams, on the contrary, should be put for a\r\nfortnight on short, dry feed, to stop the flow of milk. They should be\r\nlooked to after a day or two, and if the bags of any are found much\r\ndistended, the milk should be drawn away, and the bags washed for a\r\nlittle time in cold water. On short feed, they rarely give much trouble\r\nin this respect. When thoroughly dried off, they should have the best\r\nfare, to enable them to recover condition for subsequent breeding and\r\nwintering. The fall is a critical period in which to lose flesh, either\r\nfor sheep or lambs; and if any are found deficient, they should at once\r\nbe provided with extra feed and attention. If cold weather overtake\r\nthem, poor or in ill health, they will scarcely outlive it; or if by\r\nchance they survive, their emaciated carcass, impaired constitution, and\r\nscant fleece will ill repay the food and attention they will have cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION AND DOCKING.\r\n\r\nSome breeders advocate castration in a day or two after birth, while\r\nothers will not allow the operation to be performed until the lamb is a\r\nmonth old. The weight of authority, however, is in favor of any time\r\nbetween two and six weeks after birth, when the creature has attained\r\nsome strength, and the parts have not become too rigid. In such\r\ncircumstances, the best English breeders recommend from ten to fifteen\r\ndays old as the proper time. A lamb of a day old cannot be confirmed in\r\nall the functions of its body, and, indeed, in many instances, the\r\ntesticles can then scarcely be found. At a month old, on the other hand,\r\nthe lamb may be so fat, and the weather so warm, that the operation may\r\nbe attended with febrile action. Dry, pleasant weather should be\r\nselected for this: a cool day, if possible; if warm, it should be done\r\nearly in the morning.\r\n\r\nCastration is a simple and safe process. Let a man hold a lamb with its\r\nback pressed firmly against his breast and stomach, and all four legs\r\ngathered in front in his hands. Cut off the bottom of the pouch, free\r\nthe testicle from the inclosing membrane, and then draw it steadily out,\r\nor clip the cord with a knife if it does not snap off at a proper\r\ndistance from the testicle. Some shepherds draw both testicles at once\r\nwith their teeth. It is usual to drop a little salt into the pouch.\r\nWhere the weather is very warm, some touch the end of the pouch with an\r\nointment, consisting of tar, lard, and turpentine. As a general thing,\r\nhowever, the animal will do as well without any application.\r\n\r\nThe object of _docking_ is to keep the sheep behind clean from filth and\r\nvermin; since the tail, if left on, is apt to collect filth, and, if the\r\nanimal purges, becomes an intolerable nuisance. The tail, however,\r\nshould not be docked too short, since it is a protection against cold in\r\nwinter. This operation is by many deferred till a late period, from\r\napprehension of too much loss of blood; but, if the weather be favorable\r\nand the lamb in good condition, it may be performed at the same time as\r\ncastration with the least trouble and without injury.\r\n\r\nThe tail should be laid upon a plank, the animal being held in the same\r\nposition as before. With one hand the skin is drawn toward the body,\r\nwhile another person, with a two-inch chisel and mallet, strikes it off\r\nat a blow, between the bone-joints, leaving it from one and a half to\r\ntwo inches long. The skin immediately slips back over the wound, which\r\nis soon healed. Should bleeding continue--as, however, rarely\r\nhappens--so long as to sicken the lamb, a small cord should be tied\r\nfirmly round the end of the tail; but this must not be allowed to remain\r\non above twenty-four hours, as the points of the tail would slough off.\r\nEwe lambs should be docked closer than rams. To prevent flies and\r\nmaggots, and assist in healing, it is well to apply an ointment composed\r\nof lard and tar, in the proportion of four pounds of the former to one\r\nquart of the latter. The lambs should be carefully protected from cold\r\nand wet till they are perfectly well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFEEDING AND MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the warm weather approaches and the grass appears, sheep\r\nbecome restive and impatient for the pasture. This instinct should be\r\nrepressed till the ground has become thoroughly dry, and the grass has\r\nacquired substance. They ought, moreover, to be provided for the change\r\nof food by the daily use of roots for a few days before turning out. The\r\ntendency to excessive purging which is induced by the first\r\nspring-feed, may be checked by housing them at night and feeding them\r\nfor the first few days with a little sound, sweet hay. They must be\r\nprovided with pure water and salt; for, though they may do tolerably\r\nwell without either, yet thrift and freedom from disease are cheaply\r\nsecured by this slight attention.\r\n\r\nAs to _water_, it may be said that it is not indispensable in the summer\r\npastures, since the dews and the succulence of the feed answer as a\r\nsubstitute; but a wide experience having demonstrated that free access\r\nto it is advantageous, particularly to those having lambs, it should be\r\nconsidered a matter of importance on a sheep-farm so to arrange the\r\npastures, if possible, as to bring water into each of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COVERED SALTING BOX.]\r\n\r\nSALT is indispensable to the health, especially in the summer. It is\r\ncommon to give it once a week, while they are at grass. It is still\r\nbetter to give them free access to it, at all times, by keeping it in a\r\ncovered box, open on one side, as in the engraving annexed. A large\r\nhollow log, with holes cut along the side for the insertion of the heads\r\nof the animals, answers very well. A sheep having free access to salt at\r\nall times will never eat too much of it; and it will take its supply at\r\nsuch times and in such quantities as Nature demands, instead of eating\r\nof it voraciously at stated periods, as intermediate abstinence will\r\nstimulate it to do. When salt is fed but once a week, it is better to\r\nhave a stated day, so that it will not be forgotten; and it is well to\r\nlay the salt on flat stones--though if laid in little handfuls on the\r\ngrass, very little of it will be lost.\r\n\r\nTAR. This is supposed by many to form a very healthful condiment for\r\nsheep, and they smear the nose with it, which is licked and swallowed as\r\nthe natural heat of the flesh, or that of the weather, causes it to\r\ntrickle down over the nostrils and lips. Others, suffering the flock to\r\nget unusually salt-hungry, place tar upon flat stones, or in troughs,\r\nand then scatter salt upon it so that both may be consumed together.\r\nApplied to the nose, in the nature of a cataplasm, it may be\r\nadvantageous in catarrhs; and in the same place, at the proper periods,\r\nits odor may, perhaps, repel the fly, the eggs of which produce the\r\n\"gout in the head,\" as it is termed. However valuable it may be as a\r\nmedicine, and even as a debergent in the case specified, there is but\r\nslight ground for confidence in it merely as a condiment.\r\n\r\n_Dry_, _sweet pastures_, and such as abound in aromatic and bitter\r\nplants, are best suited for sheep-walks. No animal, with the exception\r\nof the goat, crops so great a variety of plants. They eat many which are\r\nrejected by the horse and the ox, which are even essential to their own\r\nwants. In this respect they are valuable assistants to the husbandman,\r\nas they feed greedily on wild mustard, burdock, thistles, marsh-mallows,\r\nmilk-weed, and various other offending plants; and the Merino exceeds\r\nthe more recent breeds in the range of his selections.\r\n\r\nIn pastures, however, where the dry stalks of the burdock, or the\r\nhound's-tongue, or tory-weed have remained standing over the winter, the\r\nburs are caught in the now long wool, and, if they are numerous, the\r\nwool is rendered entirely unmarketable and almost valueless. Even the\r\ndry prickles of the common and Canada thistles, where they are very\r\nnumerous, get into the neck-wool of sheep, as they thrust their heads\r\nunder and among them to crop the first scarce feed of the northern\r\nspring; and, independently of injuring the wool, they make it difficult\r\nto wash and otherwise handle the sheep. Indeed, it is a matter of the\r\nsoundest policy to keep sheep on the cleanest pastures, those free from\r\nthese and similar plants; and in a region where they are pastured the\r\nyear round, they should be kept from contact with them for some months\r\nprior to shearing.\r\n\r\nMany prepare _artificial pastures_ for their flocks, which may be done\r\nwith a number of plants. Winter rye, or wheat sown early in the season,\r\nmay be fed off in the fall, without injury to the crop; and, in the\r\nfollowing spring, the rye may be pastured till the stalks shoot up and\r\nbegin to form a head. This affords an early and nutritious food. Corn\r\nmay be sown broadcast, or thickly in drills, and either fed off in the\r\nfields or cut and carried to the sheep in their folds. White mustard is\r\nalso a valuable crop for this purpose.\r\n\r\nTo give sheep sufficient variety, it is better _to divide their range_\r\ninto several smaller ones, and change them as often, at least, as once a\r\nweek. They seek a favorite resting-place, on a dry, elevated part of the\r\nfield, which soon becomes soiled. By removing them from this for a few\r\ndays, rain will cleanse or the sun dry it, so as to make it again\r\nsuitable for them. More sheep may be kept, and in better condition,\r\nwhere this practice is adopted, than where they are confined to the same\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nSHADE. No one who has observed with what eagerness sheep seek shade in\r\nhot weather, and how they pant and apparently suffer when a hot sun is\r\npouring down upon their nearly naked bodies, will doubt that, both as a\r\nmatter of humanity and utility, they should be provided, during the hot\r\nsummer-months, with a better shelter than that afforded by a common\r\nrail-fence. Forest trees are the most natural and the best shades, and\r\nit is as contrary to utility as it is to good taste to strip them\r\nentirely from the sheep-walks. A strip of stone-wall or close board\r\nfence on the south and west sides of the pasture, forms a tolerable\r\nsubstitute for trees. But in the absence of all these and of buildings\r\nof any kind, a shade can be cheaply constructed of poles and brush, in\r\nthe same manner as the sheds of the same materials for winter shelter,\r\nwhich will be hereafter described.\r\n\r\nFENCES. Poor _fences_ will teach ewes and wethers, as well as rams, to\r\njump; and for a jumping flock there is no remedy but immoderately high\r\nfences, or extirpation. One jumper will soon teach the trick to a whole\r\nflock; and if one by chance is brought in, it should be immediately\r\nhoppled or killed. The last is by far the surest and safest remedy.\r\n\r\nHOPPLING is done by sewing the ends of a leather strap, broad at the\r\nextremities, so that it will not cut into the flesh, to a fore and hind\r\nleg, just above the pastern joints, leaving the legs at about the\r\nnatural distance apart. _Clogging_ is fastening a billet of wood to the\r\nfore leg by a leather strap. _Yoking_ is fastening two rams two or three\r\nfeet apart, by bows around their necks, inserted in a light piece of\r\ntimber, some two or three inches in size. _Poking_ is done by inserting\r\na bow in a short bit of light timber, into which bit--worn on the under\r\nside of the neck--a rod is inserted, which projects a couple of feet in\r\nfront of the sheep.\r\n\r\nThese and similar devices, to prevent rams from scaling fences, may be\r\nemployed as a last resort by those improvident farmers who prefer, by\r\nsuch troublesome, injurious, and, at best, insecure means, to guard\r\nagainst that viciousness which they might so much more easily have\r\nprevented from being acquired.\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS RAMS. From being teased and annoyed by boys, or petted and\r\nplayed with when young, and sometimes without any other stimulant than a\r\nnaturally vicious temper, rams occasionally become very troublesome by\r\ntheir propensity to attack men or cattle. Some will allow no man to\r\nenter the field where they are without making an immediate onset upon\r\nhim; while others will knock down the ox or horse which presumes to\r\ndispute a lock of hay with them. A ram which is known to have acquired\r\nthis propensity should at once be _hooded_, and, if not valuable, at the\r\nproper season converted into a wether. But the courage thus manifested\r\nis usually the concomitant of great strength and vigor of constitution,\r\nand of a powerfully developed frame. If good in other particulars, it is\r\na pity to lose the services of so valuable an animal. In such cases,\r\nthey may be hooded, by covering their faces with leather in such a\r\nmanner that they can only see a little backward and forward. They must\r\nthen, however, be kept apart from the flock of rams, or they will soon\r\nbe killed or injured by blows, which they cannot see to escape.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that a usually quiet-tempered ram will suddenly\r\nexhibit some pugnacity when one is salting or feeding the flock. If such\r\na person turns to run, he is immediately knocked down, and the ram\r\nlearns, from that single lesson, the secret of his mastery, and the\r\npropensity to exercise it. As the ram gives his blow from the summit of\r\nthe parietal and the posterior portion of the frontal bones on _the top_\r\nof his head, and not from the forehead, he is obliged to crouch his head\r\nso low when he makes his onset that he does not see forward well enough\r\nto swerve suddenly from his right line, and a few quick motions to the\r\nright and left enable one to escape him. Run in upon him, as he dashes\r\nby, with pitch-fork, club, or boot-heel, and punish him severely by\r\nblows about the head, if the club is used, giving him no time to rally\r\nuntil he is thoroughly cowed. This may be deemed harsh treatment, and\r\nlikely to increase the viciousness of the animal. Repeated instances\r\nhave, however, proved the contrary; and if the animal once is forced to\r\nacknowledge that he is overcome, he never forgets the lesson.\r\n\r\nPRAIRIE FEEDING. Sheep, when destined for the prairies, ought to\r\ncommence their journey as early after the shearing as possible, since\r\nthey are then disencumbered of their fleece, and do not catch and retain\r\nas much dust as when driven later; feed is also generally better, and\r\nthe roads are dry and hard. Young and healthy sheep should be selected,\r\nwith early lambs; or, if the latter are too young, and the distance\r\ngreat, they should be left, and the ewes dried off. A large wagon ought\r\nto accompany the flock, to carry such as occasionally give out; or they\r\nmay be disposed of whenever they become enfeebled. With good care, a\r\nhardy flock may be driven at the rate of twelve or fourteen miles a day.\r\nConstant watchfulness is requisite, in order to keep them healthy and in\r\ngood plight. One-half the expense of driving may be saved by the use of\r\nwell-trained shepherd-dogs.\r\n\r\nWhen arrived at their destination, they must be thoroughly washed, to\r\nfree them from all dirt, and closely examined as to any diseases which\r\nthey may have contracted, that these may be promptly removed. A variety\r\nof suitable food and good shelter must be provided for the autumn,\r\nwinter, and spring ensuing, and every necessary attention given to them.\r\nThis would be necessary if they were indigenous to the country; but it\r\nis much more so when they have just undergone a campaign to which\r\nneither they nor their race have been accustomed.\r\n\r\nSheep cannot be kept on the prairies without much care, artificial food,\r\nand proper attention; and losses have often occurred, by reason of a\r\nfalse system of economy attempted by many, from disease and mortality in\r\nthe flocks, amply sufficient to have made a generous provision for the\r\ncomfort and security of twice the number lost. More especially do they\r\nrequire proper food and attention after the first severe frosts set in,\r\nwhich wither and kill the natural grasses. By nibbling at the bog--the\r\nfrostbitten, dead grass--they are inevitably subject to constipation,\r\nwhich a bountiful supply of roots, sulphur, etc., is alone sufficient to\r\nremove.\r\n\r\nRoots, grain, good hay, straw, corn-stalks, and pea or bean-vines are\r\nessential to the preservation of their health and thrift during the\r\nwinter, everywhere north of thirty-nine degrees. In summer, the natural\r\nherbage is sufficient to sustain them in fine condition, till they shall\r\nhave acquired a denser population of animals, when it will be found\r\nnecessary to stock their meadows with the best varieties of artificial\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\nThe prairies seem adapted to the usual varieties of sheep introduced\r\ninto the United States; and of such are the flocks made up, according to\r\nthe taste or judgment of the owners. Shepherd dogs are invaluable to the\r\nowners of flocks, in these unfenced, illimitable ranges, both as a\r\ndefence against the small prairie wolves, which prowl around the sheep,\r\nbut have been rapidly thinned off by the settlers, and also as\r\nassistants to the shepherds in driving and herding their flocks on the\r\nopen ground.\r\n\r\nFALL FEEDING. In the North, the grass often gets very short by the tenth\r\nor fifteenth of November, and it has lost most of its nutritiousness\r\nfrom repeated freezing and thawing. At this time, although no snow may\r\nhave fallen, it is best to give the sheep a light, daily foddering of\r\nbright hay, and a few oats in the bundle. Given thus for the ten or\r\ntwelve days which precede the covering of the ground by snow, fodder\r\npays for itself as well as at any other time during the year. It is well\r\nto feed oats in the bundle, or threshed oats, about a gill to the head,\r\nin the feeding-troughs, carried to the field for that purpose.\r\n\r\nWINTER FEEDING. The time for taking sheep from the pastures must depend\r\non the state of the weather and food. Severe frosts destroy much of the\r\nnutriment in the grasses, and they soon after cease to afford adequate\r\nnourishment. Long exposure to cold storms, with such food to sustain\r\nthem, will rapidly reduce the condition of these animals. The only safe\r\nrule is to transfer them to their winter-quarters the first day they\r\ncease to thrive abroad.\r\n\r\nThere is no better food for sheep than well-ripened, sound Timothy hay;\r\nthough the clovers and nearly all the cultivated grasses may be\r\nadvantageously fed. Hundreds and thousands of northern flocks receive,\r\nduring the entire winter, nothing but ordinary hay, consisting mainly of\r\nTimothy, some red and white clover, and frequently a sprinkling of gum,\r\nor spear grass. Bean and pea straw are valuable, especially the former,\r\nwhich, if properly cured, they prefer to the best hay; and it is well\r\nadapted to the production of wool. Where hay is the principal feed, it\r\nmay be well, where it is convenient, to give corn-stalks every fifth or\r\nsixth feed, or even once a day; or the daily feed, not of hay, might\r\nalternate between stalks, pea-straw, straws of the cereal grains, etc.\r\nIt is mainly a question of convenience with the farmer, provided a\r\nproper supply of palatable nutriment within a proper compass is given.\r\nIt would not, however, be entirely safe to confine any kind of sheep to\r\nthe straw of the cereal grains, unless it were some of those little\r\nhardy varieties of animals which would be of no use in this country.\r\n\r\nThe expediency of feeding _grain_ to store-sheep in winter depends much\r\non circumstances. If in a climate where they can obtain a proper supply\r\nof grass or other green esculents, it would, of course, be unnecessary;\r\nnor is it a matter of necessity where the ground is frozen or covered\r\nwith snow for weeks or months, provided the sheep be plentifully\r\nsupplied with good dry fodder. Near markets where the coarser grains\r\nfind a quick sale at fair prices, it is not usual, in the North, to feed\r\ngrain. Remote from markets it is generally fed by the holders of large\r\nflocks. Oats are commonly preferred, and they are fed at the rate of a\r\ngill a head per day. Some feed half the same amount of yellow corn.\r\nFewer sheep, particularly lambs and yearlings, get thin and perish where\r\nthey receive a daily feed of grain; they consume less hay, and their\r\nfleeces are increased in weight. On the whole, therefore, it is\r\nconsidered good economy. Where no grain is fed, three daily feeds of hay\r\nare given. The smaller sizes of the Saxon may be well sustained on two\r\npounds of hay; but larger sheep will consume from three and a half to\r\nfour or even five pounds per day. Sheep, in common with all other\r\nanimals, when exposed to cold, will consume much more than if well\r\nprotected, or during a warmer season.\r\n\r\nIt is a common and very good practice to feed greenish cut oats in the\r\nbundle, at noon, and give but two feeds of hay, one at morning and one\r\nat night. Some feed greenish cut peas in the same way. In warm, thawing\r\nweather, when sheep get to the ground and refuse dry hay, a little grain\r\nassists materially in keeping up their strength and condition. When the\r\nfeed is shortest in winter, in the South, there are many localities\r\nwhere sheep can get enough grass to take off their appetite for dry hay,\r\nbut not quite enough to keep them in prime order. A moderate daily feed\r\nof oats or pease, placed in the depository racks, would keep them strong\r\nand in good plight for the lambing season, and increase their weight of\r\nwool.\r\n\r\nFew Northern farmers feed _Indian corn_ to store-sheep, as it is\r\nconsidered too hot and stimulating, and sheep are thought to become more\r\nliable to become \"cloyed\" on it than on oats, pease, etc. Yellow corn is\r\nnot generally judged a very safe feed for lambs and yearlings.\r\nStore-sheep should be kept in good, fair, plump condition. Lambs and\r\nyearlings may be as fat as they will become on proper feeding. It is\r\nstated that sheep will eat _cotton-seed_, and thrive on it.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that sheep are not to be allowed to get thin\r\nduring the winter, with the idea that their condition can at any time be\r\nreadily raised by better feed, as with the horse or ox. It is always\r\ndifficult, and, unless properly managed, expensive and hazardous, to\r\nattempt to raise the condition of a poor flock in the winter, especially\r\nif they have reached that point where they manifest weakness. If the\r\nfeeding of a liberal allowance of grain be suddenly commenced, fatal\r\ndiarrh[oe]a will often supervene. All extra feeding, therefore, must be\r\nbegun very gradually; and it does not appear, in any case, to produce\r\nproportionable results.\r\n\r\n_Roots_, such as ruta-bagas, Irish potatoes, and the like, make a good\r\nsubstitute for grain, or as extra feed for grown sheep. The ruta-baga is\r\npreferable to the potato in its equivalents of nutriment. No root,\r\nhowever, is as good for lambs and yearlings as an equivalent of grain.\r\nSheep may be taught to eat nearly all the cultivated roots. This is done\r\nby withholding salt from them, and then feeding the chopped roots a few\r\ntimes, rubbed with just sufficient salt to induce them to eat the root\r\nto obtain it; but not enough to satisfy their appetite for salt before\r\nthey have acquired a taste for the roots.\r\n\r\nIt is customary with some farmers to cut down, from time to time in the\r\nwinter, and draw into the sheep-yards, young trees of the _hemlock_,\r\nwhose foliage is greedily eaten by the sheep, after being confined for\r\nsome time to dry feed. This browse is commonly used, like tar, for some\r\nsupposed medicinal virtues. It is pronounced \"healthy\" for sheep. Much\r\nthe same remarks might be made about this as have been already made\r\nconcerning tar. No tonics and stimulants are needed for a healthy\r\nanimal. If the foliage of the hemlock were constantly accessible to\r\nthem, there would be no possible objection to their eating it, since\r\ntheir instincts, in that case, would teach them whether, and in what\r\nquantities, to devour it; but when entirely confined to dry feed for a\r\nprotracted period, sheep will consume injurious and even poisonous\r\nsucculents, and of the most wholesome ones, hurtful quantities. As a\r\nmere _laxative_, an occasional feed of hemlock may be beneficial;\r\nthough, in this point of view, a day's run at grass, in a thaw, or a\r\nfeed of roots, would produce the same result. In a climate where grass\r\nis procurable most of the time, browse for medicinal purposes is\r\nentirely unnecessary.\r\n\r\nSheep undoubtedly require _salt_ in winter. Some salt their hay when it\r\nis stored in the barn or stack. This is objectionable, since the\r\nappetite of the sheep is much the safest guide in the premises. It may\r\nbe left accessible to them in the salt-box, as in summer; or an\r\noccasional feed of grined hay or straw may be given them in warm,\r\nthawing weather, when their appetite is poor. This last is an excellent\r\nplan, and serves a double purpose. With a wisp of straw, sprinkle a thin\r\nlayer of straw with brine, then another layer of straw, and another\r\nsprinkling, and so on. Let this lie until the next day, for the brine to\r\nbe absorbed by the straw, and then feed it to all the grazing animals on\r\nthe farm which need salting.\r\n\r\n_Water_ is indispensable, unless sheep have access to succulent food, or\r\nclean snow. Constant access to a brook or spring is best; but, in\r\ndefault of this, they should be watered at least _once a day_ in some\r\nother way.\r\n\r\nFEEDING WITH OTHER STOCK. Sheep should not run, or be fed, _in yards_,\r\nwith any other stock. Cattle hook them, often mortally; and colts tease\r\nand frequently injure them. It is often said that \"colts will pick up\r\nwhat sheep leave.\" But well-managed sheep rarely leave any thing; and,\r\nif they chance so to do, it is better to rake it up and throw it into\r\nthe colts' yard, than to feed them together. If sheep are not required\r\nto eat their food pretty clean, they will soon learn to waste large\r\nquantities. If, however, they are over-fed with either hay or grain, it\r\nis not proper to compel them, by starvation, to come back and eat it.\r\nThis they will not do, unless sorely pinched. Clean out the troughs, or\r\nrake up the hay, and the next time feed less.\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF FLOCKS. If flocks are shut up in small inclosures during\r\nwinter, according to the northern custom, it is necessary to divide them\r\ninto flocks of about one hundred each, consisting of sheep of about the\r\nsame size and strength; otherwise, the stronger rob the weaker, and the\r\nlatter rapidly decline. This is not so important where the sheep roam at\r\nlarge; but, even in that case, some division and classification are\r\nbest. It is best, indeed, even in summer. The poorer and feebler can by\r\nthis means receive better pasture, or a little more grain and better\r\nshelter in winter.\r\n\r\nBy those who grow wool to any extent, breeding ewes, lambs, and wethers,\r\nare invariably kept in separate flocks in winter; and it is best to keep\r\nyearling sheep by themselves with a few of the smallest two-year-olds,\r\nand any old crones which are kept for their excellence as breeders, but\r\nwhich cannot maintain themselves in the flock of breeding ewes.\r\n\r\nOld and feeble or wounded sheep, late-born lambs, etc., should be\r\nplaced by themselves, even if the number be small, as they require\r\nbetter feed, warmer shelter, and more attention. Unless the sheep are of\r\na peculiarly valuable variety, however, it is better to sell them off in\r\nthe fall at any price, or to give them to some poor neighbor who has\r\ntime to nurse them, and who may thus commence a flock.\r\n\r\nREGULARITY IN FEEDING. If any one principle in sheep husbandry deserves\r\ncareful attention more than others, it is, that _the utmost regularity\r\nmust be preserved in feeding_.\r\n\r\nFirst, there should be regularity as to _the times_ of feeding. However\r\nabundantly provided for, when a flock are foddered sometimes at one hour\r\nand sometimes at another--sometimes three times a day, and sometimes\r\ntwice--some days grain, and some days none--they cannot be made to\r\nthrive. They will do far better on inferior keep, if fed with strict\r\nregularity. In a climate where they require hay three times a day, the\r\nbest times for feeding are about sunrise in the morning, at noon, and an\r\nhour before dark at night. Unlike cattle and horses, sheep do not feed\r\nwell in the dark; and, therefore, they should have time to consume their\r\nfood before night sets in. Noon is the common time for feeding grain or\r\nroots, and is the best time, if but two fodderings of hay are given. If\r\nthe sheep receive hay three times, it is not a matter of much\r\nconsequence with which feeding grain is given, only that the practice be\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is highly essential that there should be regularity in _the\r\namount_ fed. The consumption of hay will, it is true, depend much upon\r\nthe weather; the keener the cold, the more the sheep will eat. In the\r\nSouth, much depends upon the amount of grass obtained. In many places, a\r\nlight, daily foddering supplies; in others, a light foddering placed in\r\nthe depository racks once in two days, answers the purpose. In the\r\nsteady cold weather of the North, the shepherd readily learns to\r\ndetermine about how much hay will be consumed before the next foddering\r\ntime. And this amount should, as near as may be, be regularly fed. In\r\nfeeding grain or roots, there is no difficulty in preserving entire\r\nregularity; and it is vastly more important than in feeding hay. Of the\r\nlatter, a sheep will not over-eat and surfeit itself; of the former, it\r\nwill. Even if it be not fed grain to the point of surfeiting, it will\r\nexpect a like amount, however over-plenteous, at the next feeding;\r\nfailing to receive which, it will pine for it, and manifest uneasiness.\r\nThe effect of such irregularity on the stomach and system of any animal\r\nis bad; and the sheep suffers more from it than any other animal. It is\r\nmuch better that the flock receive no grain at all, than that they\r\nreceive it without regard to regularity in the amount. The shepherd\r\nshould _measure_ out the grain to the sheep in all instances, instead of\r\n_guessing_ it out, and measure it to each separate flock.\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF FOOD. Well-fed sheep, as has been previously remarked, produce\r\nmore wool than poorly fed ones. No doctrine is more clearly recognized\r\nin agricultural chemistry than that animal tissues derive their chemical\r\ncomponents from the same components existing in their food. Various\r\nanalyses show that the chemical composition of wool, hair, hoofs, nails,\r\nhorns, feathers, lean meat, blood, cellular tissue, nerves, etc., are\r\nnearly identical.\r\n\r\nThe organic part of wool, according to standard authorities, consists of\r\ncarbon, 50.65; hydrogen, 7.03; nitrogen, 17.71; oxygen and sulphur,\r\n24.61. The inorganic constituents are small. When burned, it leaves but\r\na trifling per cent. of ash.\r\n\r\nThe large quantity of nitrogen contained in wool shows that its\r\nproduction is increased by highly azotized food; and from various\r\nexperiments made, a striking correspondence has been found to exist\r\nbetween the amount of wool and the amount of nitrogen in food. _Pease_\r\nrank first in increasing the wool, and very high in the average\r\ncomparative increase which they produce in all the tissues.\r\n\r\nThe increase of fat and muscle, as of wool, depends upon the nature of\r\nthe food. It is not very common, in the North, for wool-growers to\r\nfatten their wethers for market by extra winter feeding. Some give them\r\na little more generous keep the winter before they are to be turned off,\r\nand then salt them when they have obtained their maximum fatness the\r\nsucceeding fall.\r\n\r\nStall-feeding is lost on an ill-shaped, unthrifty animal. The perfection\r\nof form and health, and the uniform good condition which characterizes\r\nthe thrifty one, indicate, too plainly to be misunderstood, those which\r\nwill best repay the care of their owner. The selection of any\r\nindifferent animal for stall-fattening will inevitably be attended with\r\nloss. Such ought to be got rid of, when first brought from the pasture,\r\nfor the wool they will bring.\r\n\r\nWhen winter fattening is attempted, sheep require warm, dry shelters,\r\nand should receive, in addition to all the hay they will eat, meal twice\r\na day in troughs--or meal once and chopped roots once. The equivalent of\r\nfrom half a pint to a pint of yellow corn meal per head each day is\r\nabout as much as ordinary stocks of Merino wethers will profitably\r\nconsume; though in selected flocks, consisting of large animals, this\r\namount is frequently exceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nYARDS.\r\n\r\nExperience has amply demonstrated that--in the climate of the Northern\r\nand Eastern States, where no grass grows from four to four and a half\r\nmonths in the winter, and where, therefore, all that can be obtained\r\nfrom the ground is the repeatedly frozen, unnutritious herbage left in\r\nthe fall--it is better to keep sheep confined in yards, excepting where\r\nthe ground is covered with snow. If suffered to roam over the fields at\r\nother times, they get enough grass to take away their appetite for dry\r\nhay, but not enough to sustain them; they fall away, and toward spring\r\nthey become weak, and a large proportion of them frequently perish.\r\nFlocks of some size are here, of course, alluded to, and on properly\r\nstocked farms. A few sheep would do better with a boundless range.\r\n\r\nSome let out their sheep occasionally for a single day, during a thaw;\r\nothers keep them entirely from the ground until let out to grass in the\r\nspring. The former course is preferable where the sheep ordinarily get\r\nnothing but dry fodder. It affords a healthy laxative, and a single\r\nday's grazing will not take off their appetite from more than one\r\nsucceeding dry feed. It is necessary, in the North, to keep sheep in the\r\nyards until the feed has got a good start in the spring, or they will\r\nget off from their feed--particularly the breeding ewes--and get weak at\r\nthe most critical time for them in the year.\r\n\r\nYards should be firm-bottomed, dry, and, in the northern climate, kept\r\nwell littered with straw. The yarding system is not practised to any\r\ngreat extent in the South; nor should it be, where sheep can get their\r\nliving from the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING-RACKS.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground is frozen, and especially when covered with snow, the\r\nsheep eats hay well on the ground; but when the land is soft, muddy, or\r\nfoul with manure, they will scarcely touch hay placed on it--or, if they\r\ndo, will tread much of it into the mud, in their restlessness while\r\nfeeding. It should then be fed in racks, which are more economical, even\r\nin the first-named case; since, when the hay is fed on the ground, the\r\nleaves and seeds, the most valuable part of the fodder, are almost\r\nwholly lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CONVENIENT BOX-RACK.]\r\n\r\nTo make an economical _box-rack_--the one in most general use in the\r\nNorth--take six light pieces of scantling, say three inches square, one\r\nfor each corner, and one for the centre of each side. Boards of pine or\r\nhemlock, twelve or fifteen feet long, and twelve or fourteen inches\r\nwide, may then be nailed on to the bottom of the posts for the sides,\r\nwhich are separated by similar boards at the ends, two and a half feet\r\nlong. Boards twelve inches wide, raised above the lower ones by a space\r\nof from nine to twelve inches, are nailed on the sides and ends, which\r\ncompletes the rack. The edges of the opening should be made perfectly\r\nsmooth, to prevent chafing or tearing out the wool. The largest\r\ndimensions given are suitable for the large breeds, and the smallest for\r\nthe Saxon; and still smaller are proper for the lambs. These should be\r\nset on dry ground, or under the sheds; and they can be easily removed\r\nwherever necessary. Unless over-fed, sheep waste very little hay in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSome prefer the racks made with slats, or smooth, upright sticks, in the\r\nform of the common horse-rack. This kind should always be accompanied by\r\na broad trough affixed to the bottom, to catch the fine hay which falls\r\nin feeding. These racks may be attached to the side of a building, or\r\nused double. A small lamb requires fifteen inches of space, and a large\r\nsheep two feet, for quiet, comfortable feeding; and this amount of room,\r\nat least, should be provided around the racks for every sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A HOLE-RACK.]\r\n\r\nWith what is termed a _hole-rack_, sheep do not crowd and take advantage\r\nof each other so much as with log-racks; but they are too heavy and\r\nunnecessarily expensive for a common out-door rack. This rack is\r\nbox-shaped, with the front formed of a board nailed on horizontally, or,\r\nmore commonly, by nailing the boards perpendicularly, the bottoms on the\r\nsill of a barn, and the tops to horizontal pieces of timber. The holes\r\nshould be at least eight inches wide, nine inches high, and eighteen\r\ninches from centre to centre.\r\n\r\nIn the South, racks are not so necessary for that constant use to which\r\nthey are put in colder sections, as they are for depositories of dry\r\nfood, for the occasional visitation of the sheep. In soft, warm\r\nweather, when the ground is unfrozen, and any kind of green herbage is\r\nto be obtained, sheep will scarcely touch dry fodder; though the little\r\nthey will then eat will be highly serviceable to them. But in a sudden\r\nfreeze, or on the occurrence of cold storms, they will resort to the\r\nracks, and fill themselves with dry food. They anticipate the coming\r\nstorm by instinct, and eat an extra quantity of food to sustain the\r\nanimal heat during the succeeding depression of temperature. They should\r\nalways have racks of dry fodder for resort in such emergencies.\r\n\r\nThese racks should have covers or roofs to protect their contents from\r\nrain, as otherwise the feed would often be spoiled before but a small\r\nportion of it would be consumed. Hay or straw, saturated with water, or\r\nsoaked and dried, is only eaten by the sheep as a matter of absolute\r\nnecessity. The common box-rack would answer the purpose very well by\r\nplacing on the top a triangular cover or roof, formed of a couple of\r\nboards, one hung at the upper edge with iron or leather hinges, so that\r\nit could be lifted up like a lid; making the ends tight; drawing in the\r\nlower edges of the sides, so that it should not be more than a foot wide\r\non the bottom; inserting a flow; and then mounting it on, and making it\r\nfast to, two cross-sills, four or five inches square, to keep the floor\r\noff from the ground, and long enough to prevent it from being easily\r\noverturned. The lower side-board should be narrow, on account of the\r\nincreased height given its upper edge by the sills.\r\n\r\nA rack of the same construction, with the sides like those described for\r\nthe hole-rack, would be still better, though somewhat more expensive; or\r\nthe sides might consist of rundles, the top being nailed down in either\r\ncase, and the fodder inserted by little doors in the ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOPPER-RACK.]\r\n\r\nWhat is termed the _hopper-rack_, serving both for a rack and a\r\nfeeding-trough, is a favorite with many sheep-owners. The accompanying\r\ncut represents a section of such a rack. A piece of durable wood, about\r\nfour and a half feet long, six or eight inches deep, and four inches\r\nthick, having two notches, _a a_, cut into it, and two troughs, made of\r\ninch boards, _b b b b_, placed in these notches, and nailed fast,\r\nconstitute the formation. If the rack is to be fourteen feet long, three\r\nsills are required. The ends of the rack are made by nailing against the\r\nside of the sill-boards that reach up as high as it is desired to have\r\nthe rack; and nails driven through these end-boards into the ends of the\r\nside-boards, _f f_, secure them. The sides may be further strengthened\r\nby pieces of board on the outside of them, fitted into the trough. A\r\nroof may be put over all, if desired, by means of which the fodder is\r\nkept entirely from the weather, and no seeds or chaff can get into the\r\nwool.\r\n\r\n\r\nTROUGHS.\r\n\r\nThreshed grain, chopped roots, etc., when fed to sheep, should be placed\r\nin troughs. With either of the racks which have been described, except\r\nthe last, a separate trough would be required. The most economical are\r\nmade of two boards of any convenient length, ten to twelve inches wide.\r\nNail the lower side of one upon the edge of the other, fastening both\r\ninto a two or three-inch plank, fifteen inches long, and a foot wide,\r\nnotched in its upper edge in the form required. In snowy sections they\r\nare turned over after feeding, and when falls of snow are anticipated\r\none end is laid on the yard-fence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ECONOMICAL SHEEP-TROUGH.]\r\n\r\nVarious contrivances have been brought to notice for keeping grain where\r\nsheep can feed on it at will, a description of which is omitted, since\r\nit is not thought best, by the most successful stock-raisers, in feeding\r\nor fattening any quadrupeds, to allow them grain at will, stated feeds\r\nbeing preferred by them; and the same is true of fodder. If this system\r\nis departed from in using depository racks, as recommended, it is\r\nbecause it is rendered necessary by the circumstances of the case. A\r\nMerino store-sheep, allowed as much grain as it chose to consume, would\r\nbe likely to inflict injury on itself; and grain so fed would, generally\r\nspeaking, be productive of more damage than benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNS AND SHEDS.\r\n\r\nShelters, in northern climates, are indispensable to profitable\r\nsheep-raising; and in every latitude north of the Gulf of Mexico, they\r\nwould probably be found advantageous. An animal eats much less when thus\r\nprotected; he is more thrifty, less liable to disease, and his manure\r\nis richer and more abundant. The feeding may be done in the open yard in\r\nclear weather, and under cover in severe storms: for, even in the\r\nvigorous climate of the North, none but the breeders of Saxons make a\r\nregular practice of feeding under cover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP-BARN WITH SHEDS.]\r\n\r\nHumanity and economy alike dictate that, in the North, sheep should be\r\nprovided with shelters under which to lie nights, and to which they can\r\nresort at will. It is not an uncommon circumstance in New York and New\r\nEngland for snow to fall to the depth of from twenty to thirty inches\r\nwithin twenty-four or forty-eight hours, and then to be succeeded by a\r\nstrong and intensely cold west or northwest wind of several days\r\ncontinuance, which lifts the snow, blocking up the roads, and piling\r\nhuge drifts to the leeward of fences, barns, etc.\r\n\r\nA flock without shelter will huddle closely together, turning their\r\nbacks to the storm, constantly stepping, and thus treading down the snow\r\nas it rises about them. Strong, close-coated sheep do not seem to suffer\r\nas much from the cold, for a period, as would be expected. It is,\r\nhowever, almost impossible to feed them enough, or half enough, under\r\nsuch circumstances, without an immense waste of hay--entirely\r\nimpossible, indeed, without racks. The hay is whirled away in an instant\r\nby the wind; and, even if racks are used, the sheep, leaving their\r\nhuddle, where they were kept warm and even moist by the melting snow in\r\ntheir wool, soon get chilled, and are disposed to return to their\r\nhuddle. Imperfectly filled with food, the supply of animal heat is\r\nlowered, and, at the end of the second or third day, the feeble ones\r\nsink down hopelessly, the yearlings, and those somewhat old, receive a\r\nshock from which nothing but the most careful nursing will enable them\r\nto rally, and even the strongest suffer an injurious loss in condition.\r\n\r\nFew persons, therefore, who own as many as forty or fifty sheep, attempt\r\nto get along without some kind of shelters, which are variously\r\nconstructed, to suit their tastes or circumstances. A sheep-barn, built\r\nupon a side-hill, will afford two floors: one underneath, surrounded by\r\nthree sides of wall, should open to the south, with sliding or swinging\r\ndoors to guard against storms; and another may be provided above, if the\r\nfloors are perfectly tight, with proper gutters to carry off the urine;\r\nand sufficient storage for the fodder can be furnished by scaffolds\r\noverhead. They may also be constructed with twelve or fifteen-feet posts\r\non level ground, allowing the sheep to occupy the lower part, with the\r\nfodder stored above.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, however, _thorough ventilation should be provided_; for of\r\nthe two evils, of exposure to cold or of too great privation of air, the\r\nformer is to be preferred. Sheep cannot long endure close confinement\r\nwithout injury. In all ordinary weather, a shed, closely boarded on\r\nthree sides, with a light roof, is sufficient protection; especially if\r\nthe open side is shielded from bleak winds, or leads into a\r\nwell-inclosed yard. If the floors above are used for storage, they\r\nshould be made tight, that no hay, chaff, or dust can fall upon the\r\nfleece. The sheds attached to the barn are not usually framed or silled,\r\nbut are supported by some posts of durable timber set in the ground. The\r\nroofs are formed of boards battened with slats. The barn has generally\r\nno partitions within, and is entirely filled with hay.\r\n\r\nThere are many situations in which open sheds are very liable to have\r\nsnow drifted under them by certain winds, and they are subject in all\r\nsevere gales to have the snow carried over them to fall down in large\r\ndrifts in front, which gradually encroach on the sheltered space, and\r\nare very inconvenient, particularly when they thaw. For these reasons,\r\nmany prefer sheep-houses covered on all sides, with the exception of a\r\nwide doorway for ingress and egress, and one or two windows for the\r\nnecessary ventilation. They are convenient for yarding sheep, and the\r\nvarious processes for which this is required; as for shearing, marking,\r\nsorting, etc., and especially so for lambing-places, or the confinement\r\nof newly-shorn sheep in cold storms. They should have so much space\r\nthat, in addition to the outside racks, others can be placed temporarily\r\nthrough the middle when required.\r\n\r\nThe facts must not be overlooked--as bearing upon the question of\r\nshelter, even in the warmer regions of the country--that cold rains, or\r\nrains of any temperature, when immediately succeeded by cold or freezing\r\nweather, or cold, piercing winds, are more hurtful to sheep than even\r\nsnow-storms; and that, consequently, sheep must be adequately guarded\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SHED OF RAILS.]\r\n\r\nSHEDS. The simplest and cheapest kind of shed is formed by poles or\r\nrails, the upper end resting on a strong horizontal pole supported by\r\ncrotched posts set in the ground. It may be rendered rain-proof by\r\npea-vines, straw, or pine boughs. In a region where timber is very\r\ncheap, planks or boards, of a sufficient thickness not to spring\r\ndownward, and thus open the roof, battened with slats, may take the\r\nplace of the poles and boughs; and they would make a tighter and more\r\ndurable roof. If the lower ends of the boards or poles are raised a\r\ncouple of feet from the ground, by placing a log under them, the shed\r\nwill shelter more sheep.\r\n\r\nThese movable sheds may be connected with hay-barns--\"hay-barracks\"--or\r\nthey may surround an inclosed space with a stack in the middle. In the\r\nlatter case, the yard should be square, on account of the divergence in\r\nthe lower ends of the boards or poles, which a round form would render\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nSheds of this description are frequently made between two stacks. The\r\nend of the horizontal supporting-pole is placed on the stack-pens when\r\nthe stacks are built, and the middle is propped by crotched posts. The\r\nsupporting-pole may rest, in the same way, on the upper girts of two\r\nhay-barracks; or two such sheds, at angles with each other, might form\r\nwings to this structure.\r\n\r\nOn all large sheep-farms, convenience requires that there be one barn of\r\nconsiderable size, to contain the shearing-floor, and the necessary\r\nconveniences about it for yarding the sheep, etc. This should also, for\r\nthe sake of economy, be a hay-barn, where hay is used. It may be\r\nconstructed in the corner of four fields, so that four hundred sheep can\r\nbe fed from it, without racking flocks of improper size. At this barn it\r\nwould be expedient to make the best shelters, and to bring together all\r\nthe breeding-ewes on the farm, if their number does not exceed four\r\nhundred. The shepherd would thus be saved much travel at all times, and\r\nparticularly at the lambing-time, and each flock would be under his\r\nalmost constant supervision.\r\n\r\nThe size of this barn is a question to be determined entirely by the\r\nclimate. For large flocks of sheep, the storage of some hay or other\r\nfodder for winter is an indispensable precautionary measure, at least in\r\nany part of the United States; and, other things being equal, the\r\nfarther north, or the more elevated the land, the greater would be the\r\namount necessary to be stored.\r\n\r\nHAY-HOLDER. Where hay or other fodder is thrown out of the upper door of\r\na barn into the sheep-yard--as it always must necessarily be in any mere\r\nhay-barn--or where it is thrown from a barrack or stack, the sheep\r\nimmediately rush on it, trampling it and soiling it, and the succeeding\r\nforkfuls fall on their backs, filling their wool with dust, seed, and\r\nchaff. This is obviated by hay-holders--yards ten feet square--either\r\nportable, by being made of posts and boards, or simply a pen of rails,\r\nplaced under the doors of the barns, and by the sides of each stack or\r\nbarrack. The hay is pitched into this holder in fair weather, enough for\r\na day's foddering at a time, and is taken from it by the fork and placed\r\nin the racks.\r\n\r\nThe poles or rails for stack-pens or hay-holders should be so small as\r\nto entirely prevent the sheep from inserting their heads in them after\r\nhay. A sheep will often insert his head where the opening is wide enough\r\nfor that purpose, shove it along, or get crowded, to where the opening\r\nis not wide enough to withdraw the head, and it will hang there until\r\nobserved and extricated by the shepherd. If, as often happens, it is\r\nthus caught when its foreparts are elevated by climbing up the side of\r\nthe pen, it will continue to lose its footing in its struggles, and will\r\nsoon choke to death.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAGGING.\r\n\r\nTagging, or clatting, is the removal from the sheep of such wool as is\r\nliable to get fouled when the animal is turned on to the fresh pastures.\r\nIf sheep are kept on dry feed through the winter, they will usually\r\npurge, more or less, when let out to green feed in the spring. The wool\r\naround and below the anus becomes saturated with dung, which forms into\r\nhard pellets, if the purging ceases. Whether this take place or not, the\r\nadhering dung cannot be removed from the wool in the ordinary process of\r\nwashing; and it forms a great impediment in shearing, dulling and\r\nstraining the shears to cut through it, when in a dry state, and it is\r\noften impracticable so to do. Besides, it is difficult to force the\r\nshears between it and the skin, without frequently and severely\r\nwounding the latter. Occasionally, too, flies deposit their eggs under\r\nthis mass of filth prior to shearing; and the ensuing swarm of maggots,\r\nunless speedily discovered and removed, will lead the sheep to a\r\nmiserable death.\r\n\r\nBefore the animals are let out to grass, each one should have the wool\r\nsheared from the roots of the tail down the inside of the thighs; it\r\nshould likewise be sheared from off the entire bag of the ewe, that the\r\nnewly-dropped lamb may more readily find the teat, and from the scrotum,\r\nand so much space round the point of the sheath of the ram as is usually\r\nkept wet. If the latter place is neglected, soreness and ulceration\r\nsometimes ensue from the constant maceration of the urine.\r\n\r\nAn assistant should catch the sheep and hold them while they are tagged.\r\nThe latter process requires a good shearer, as the wool must be cut off\r\nclosely and smoothly, or the object is but half accomplished, and the\r\nsheep will have an unsightly and ridiculous appearance when the\r\nremainder of their fleeces is taken off; while, on the other hand, it is\r\nnot only improper to cut the skin of a sheep at any time, but it is\r\npeculiarly so to cut that or the bag of a ewe when near lambing. The\r\nwool saved by tagging will far more than pay the expenses of the\r\noperation. It answers well for stockings and other domestic purposes, or\r\nit will sell for nearly half the price of fleece-wool.\r\n\r\nCare should be exercised at all times in handling sheep, especially ewes\r\nheavy with lamb. It is highly injurious and unsafe to chase them about\r\nand handle them roughly; for, even if abortion, the worst consequence of\r\nsuch treatment, is avoided, they become timid and shy of being touched,\r\nrendering it difficult to catch them or render them assistance at the\r\nlambing period, and even a matter of difficulty to enter the cotes, in\r\nwhich it is sometimes necessary to confine them at that time, without\r\nhaving them driving about pell-mell, running over their lambs, etc. If a\r\nsheep is suddenly caught by the wool on her running, or is lifted by the\r\nwool, the skin is to a certain extent loosened from the body at the\r\npoints where it is thus seized; and, if killed a day or two afterward,\r\nblood will be found settled about those parts.\r\n\r\nWhen sheep are to be handled, they should be inclosed in a yard just\r\nlarge enough to hold them without their being crowded, so that they\r\nshall have no chance to run and dash about. The catcher should stop them\r\nby seizing them by the hind-leg just above the hock, or by clapping one\r\nhand before the neck and the other behind the buttocks. Then, not\r\nwaiting for the sheep to make a violent struggle, he should throw its\r\nright arm over and about immediately back of the shoulders, place his\r\nhand on the brisket, and lift the animal on his hip. If the sheep is\r\nvery heavy, he can throw both arms around it, clasp his fingers under\r\nthe brisket, and lift it up against the front part of his body. He\r\nshould then set it carefully on its rump upon the tagging-table, which\r\nshould be eighteen or twenty inches high, support its back with his\r\nlegs, and hold it gently and conveniently until the tagger has performed\r\nhis duty. Two men should not be allowed to lift the same sheep together,\r\nas it will be pretty sure to receive some strain between them. A good\r\nshearer and assistant will tag two hundred sheep per day.\r\n\r\nWhen sheep receive green feed all the year round--as they do in many\r\nparts of the South--and no purging ensues from eating the\r\nnewly-starting grasses in the spring, tagging is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHING.\r\n\r\nMany judicious farmers object to washing sheep, on account of its\r\ntendency to produce colds and catarrhal affections, to which this animal\r\nis particularly subject; but it cannot well be dispensed with, as the\r\nwool is always rendered more salable; and if the operation is carefully\r\ndone, it need not be attended with injury.\r\n\r\nMr. Randall, the extensive sheep-breeder of Texas, states that he does\r\nnot wash his sheep at all, for what he deems good reasons. About the\r\nmiddle of April, or at the time when one-half of the ewes have young\r\nlambs at their sides, and the balance about to drop, would be the only\r\ntime in that region when he could wash them. At this period he would not\r\nrace or worry his ewes at all, on any account; as they should be\r\ntroubled as little as possible, and no advantage to the fleece from\r\nwashing could compensate for the injury to the animal. In his high\r\nmountain-region, lambing-time could not prudently come before the latter\r\npart of March or April--the very period when washing and shearing must\r\nbe commenced--since in February, and even up to the fifteenth or\r\ntwentieth of March, there is much bad weather, and a single cold, rainy\r\nor sleety norther would carry off one-half of the lambs dropped during\r\nits continuance.\r\n\r\nIn most of that portion of the United States lying north of forty\r\ndegrees, the washing is performed from the middle of May till the first\r\nof June, according to the season and climate. When the streams are hard,\r\nwhich is frequently the case in limestone regions, it is better to\r\nattend to it immediately after an abundant rain, which proportionately\r\nlessens the lime derived from the springs. The climate of the Southern\r\nStates would admit of an earlier time. The rule should be to wait until\r\nthe water has acquired sufficient warmth for bathing, and until cold\r\nrains and storms and cold nights are no longer to be expected.\r\n\r\nThe practice of a large majority of farmers is to drive their sheep to\r\nthe watering-ground early in the morning, on a warm day, leaving the\r\nlambs behind. The sheep are confined on the bank of the stream by a\r\ntemporary enclosure, from which they are taken, and, if not too heavy,\r\ncarried into water sufficiently deep to prevent their touching bottom.\r\nThey are then washed, by gently squeezing the fleece with the hands,\r\nafter which they are led ashore, and as much of the water pressed out as\r\npossible before letting them go, as the great weight retained in the\r\nwool frequently staggers and throws them down.\r\n\r\nBy the best flock-masters, sheep are usually washed in vats. A small\r\nstream is dammed up, and the water taken from it in an aqueduct, formed\r\nby nailing boards together, and carried till a sufficient fall is\r\nobtained to have it pour down a couple of feet or more into the vat. The\r\nbody of water, to do the work fast and well, should be some twenty-four\r\ninches wide, and five or six deep; and the swifter the current the\r\nbetter. The vat should be some three and a half feet deep, and large\r\nenough for four sheep to swim in it. A yard is built near the vat, from\r\nthe gate of which a platform extends to and incloses the vat on three\r\nsides. This keeps the washer from standing in the water, and makes it\r\nmuch easier to lift the sheep in and out. The yard is built opposite the\r\ncorners of two fields--to take advantage of the angle of one of them to\r\ndrive the sheep more readily into the yard, which should be large enough\r\nto contain the entire flock, if it does not exceed two hundred; and the\r\nbottom of it, as well as the smaller yard, unless well sodded over,\r\nshould be covered with coarse gravel, to avoid becoming muddy. If the\r\nsame establishment is used by a number of flock-masters, gravelling will\r\nalways be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the flocks are confined in the middle yard, the lambs are all\r\nimmediately caught out from among them, and set over the fence into the\r\nyard to the left, to prevent their being trampled down, as often\r\nhappens, by the old sheep, or straying off, if let loose. As many sheep\r\nare then driven out of the middle yard into the smaller yard to the\r\nright, as it will conveniently hold. A boy stands by the gate next to\r\nthe vat, to open and shut it, or the gate is drawn together with a chain\r\nand weight, and two men, catching the sheep as directed under the head\r\nof \"tagging,\" commence placing them in the water for the preparatory\r\nprocess of \"wetting.\" As soon as the water strikes through the wool,\r\nwhich occupies but an instant, the sheep is lifted out and let loose.\r\nWhere there are conveniences for so doing, this process may be more\r\nreadily performed by driving them through a stream deep enough to compel\r\nthe sheep to swim; but _swimming_ the compact-fleeced, fine-woolled\r\nsheep for any length of time--as is practised with the long-wools in\r\nEngland--will not properly cleanse the wool for steaming. The vat\r\nshould, of course, be in an inclosed field, to prevent their escape. The\r\nwhole flock should thus be passed over, and again driven round through\r\nthe field into the middle yard, where they should stand for about an\r\nhour before washing commences.\r\n\r\nThere is a large per centage of potash in the wool oil, which acts upon\r\nthe dirt independent of the favorable effect which would result from\r\nthus soaking it with water alone for some time. If washed soon after a\r\ngood shower, previous wetting might be dispensed with; and it is not,\r\nperhaps, absolutely necessary in any case. If the water is warm enough\r\nto allow the sheep to remain in it for the requisite period, they may be\r\ngot clean by washing without any previous wetting; though the snowy\r\nwhiteness of fleece, which has such an influence on the purchaser, is\r\nnot so often nor so perfectly attained in the latter way. But little\r\ntime is saved by dispensing with \"wetting,\" as it takes proportionably\r\nlonger to wash, and it is not so well for the sheep to be kept so long\r\nin the water at once.\r\n\r\nWhen the washing commences, two and sometimes four sheep are plunged in\r\nthe vat. When four are put in, two soak while two are washed. This\r\nshould not, however, be done, unless the water is very warm, and the\r\nwashers are uncommonly quick and expert; and it is, upon the whole,\r\nrather an objectionable practice, since few animals suffer so much from\r\nthe effects of a chill as the sheep; and, if they have been previously\r\nwetted, it is wholly unnecessary. When the sheep are in the water, the\r\ntwo washers commence kneading the wool with their hands about the\r\ndirtier parts--the breech, belly, etc.--and they continue to turn the\r\nsheep so that the descending current of water can strike into all parts\r\nof the fleece.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sheep are clean, which may be known by the water running\r\nentirely clear, each washer seizes his own animal by the foreparts,\r\nplunges it deep in the vats, and, taking advantage of the rebound, lifts\r\nit out, setting it gently down on its breech upon the platform. He\r\nthen--if the sheep is old and weak, and it is well in all cases--presses\r\nout some of the water from the wool, and after submitting the sheep to a\r\nprocess presently to be mentioned, lets it go.\r\n\r\nThere should be no mud about the vat, the earth not covered with sod,\r\nbeing gravelled. Sheep should be kept on clean pastures, from washing to\r\nshearing--not where they can come in contact with the ground, burnt\r\nlogs, and the like--and they should not be driven over dusty roads. The\r\nwashers should be strong and capable men, and, protected as they are\r\nfrom any thing but the water running over the sides of the vat, they can\r\nlabor several hours without inconvenience. Two hundred sheep will employ\r\ntwo experienced men not over half a day, and this rate is at times much\r\nexceeded.\r\n\r\nIt is a great object, not only as a matter of propriety and honesty, but\r\neven as an item of profit, to get the wool clean, and of a snowy\r\nwhiteness, in which condition it will always sell for more than enough\r\nextra to offset the increased labor and the diminution in weight. The\r\naverage loss in American Saxon wool in scouring, after being washed on\r\nthe back, is estimated at thirty-six per cent.; and in American Merino\r\nforty-two and a half per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCUTTING THE HOOFS.\r\n\r\nAs the hoofs of fine-woolled sheep grow rapidly, turning up in front and\r\nunder at the sides, they must be clipped as often as once a year, or\r\nthey become unsightly, give an awkward, hobbling gait to the animal, and\r\nthe part of the horn which turns under at the sides holds dirt or dung\r\nin constant contact with the soles, and even prevents it from being\r\nreadily shaken or washed out of the cleft of the foot in the natural\r\nmovement of the sheep about the pastures, as would take place were the\r\nhoof in its proper place. This greatly aggravates the hoof-ail, and\r\nrenders the curing of it more difficult; and it is thought by many to be\r\nthe exciting cause of the disease.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to clip the hoofs at tagging, or at or soon after the\r\ntime of shearing. Some employ a chisel and mallet to shorten the hoofs;\r\nbut the animal must afterward be turned upon its back, to pare off the\r\ncrust which projects and turns under. If the weather be dry, or the\r\nsheep have stood for some time on dry straw, as at shearing, the hoofs\r\nare as tough as horn, and are cut with great difficulty; and this is\r\nincreased by the grit and dirt adhering to the sole, which immediately\r\ntakes the edge off from the knife. These periods are ill-chosen, and the\r\nmethod slow and bungling. It is particularly improper to submit\r\nheavily-pregnant ewes to all this unnecessary handling at the time of\r\ntagging.\r\n\r\nWhen the sheep is washed and lifted out of the vat, and placed on its\r\nrump upon the platform, the gate-keeper should advance with a pair of\r\ntoe-nippers, and the washer present each foot separately, pressing the\r\ntoes together so that they can be severed at a single clip. The\r\nnippers--which can be made by any blacksmith who can temper an axe or a\r\nchisel--must be made strong, with handles a little more than a foot\r\nlong, the rivet being of half-inch iron, and confined with a nut, so\r\nthat they may be taken apart for sharpening. The cutting-edge should\r\ndescend upon a strip of copper inserted in the iron, to prevent it from\r\nbeing dulled. With this powerful instrument, the largest hoofs are\r\nsevered by a moderate compression of the hand. Two well-sharpened\r\nknives, which should be kept in a stand or box within reach, are then\r\ngrasped by the washer and assistant, and with two dexterous strokes to\r\neach foot, the side-crust, being free from dirt, and soaked almost as\r\nsoft as a cucumber, is reduced to the level of the sole. Two expert men\r\nwill go through these processes in a very short space of time. The\r\ncloser the paring and clipping the better, if blood be not drawn. An\r\noccasional sheep may require clipping again in the fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOE-NIPPERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEARING.\r\n\r\nThe time which should elapse between washing and shearing depends\r\naltogether on circumstances. From four to six days of bright, warm\r\nweather is sufficient; if cold, or rainy, or cloudy, more time must\r\nintervene. Sometimes the wool remains in a condition unfit for shearing\r\nfor a fortnight after washing. The rule to be observed is, that the\r\nwater should be thoroughly dried out, and the natural oil of the wool\r\nshould so far exude as to give the wool an unctious feeling, and a\r\nlively, glittering look. If it is sheared when dry, like cotton, and\r\nbefore the oil has exuded, it is very difficult to thrust the shears\r\nthrough, the umer is checked, and the wool will not keep so well for\r\nlong periods. If it is left until it gets too oily, either the\r\nmanufacturer is cheated, or, what more frequently happens, the owner\r\nloses on the price.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLEECE.]\r\n\r\nShearing, in this country, is always done on the threshing-floors of the\r\nbarns--sometimes upon low platforms, some eighteen or twenty inches\r\nhigh, but more commonly on the floor itself. The place where the sheep\r\nremain should be well littered down with straw, and fresh straw thrown\r\non occasionally, to keep the sheep clean while shearing. No chaff or\r\nother substance which will stick in the wool should be used for this\r\npurpose. The shearing should not commence until the dew, if any, has\r\ndried off from the sheep. All loose straws sticking to the wool should\r\nbe picked off, and whatever dung may adhere to any of the feet brushed\r\noff. The floor or tables used should be planed or worn perfectly smooth,\r\nso that they will not hold dirt, or catch the wool. They should all be\r\nthoroughly cleaned, and, if necessary, washed, preparatory to the\r\nprocess. If there are any sheep in the pen dirty from purging, or other\r\ncauses, they should first be caught out, to prevent them from\r\ncontaminating others.\r\n\r\nThe manner of shearing varies with almost every district; and it is\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to give intelligible practical\r\ninstructions, which would guide an entire novice in skilfully shearing\r\na sheep. Practice is requisite. The following directions are as plain,\r\nperhaps, as can be made:\r\n\r\nThe shearer may place the sheep on that part of the floor assigned to\r\nhim, resting on its rump, and himself in a posture with his right knee\r\non a cushion, and the back of the animal resting against his left thigh.\r\nHe grasps the shears about half-way from the point to the bow, resting\r\nhis thumb along the blades, which gives him better command of the\r\npoints. He may then commence cutting the wool at the brisket, and,\r\nproceeding downward, all upon the sides of the belly to the extremity of\r\nthe ribs, the external sides of both sides to the edges of the flanks;\r\nthen back to the brisket, and thence upward, shearing the wool from the\r\nbreast, front, and both sides of the neck, but not yet the back of it,\r\nand also the poll, or forepart, and top of the head. Then \"the jacket is\r\nopened\" of the sheep, and its position, as well as that of the shearer,\r\nis changed by the animal's being turned flat upon its side, one knee of\r\nthe shearer resting on the cushion, and the other gently pressing the\r\nfore-quarter of the animal, to prevent any struggling. He then resumes\r\ncutting upon the flank and rump, and thence onward to the head. Thus one\r\nside is complete. The sheep is then turned on the other side--in doing\r\nwhich great care is requisite to prevent the fleeces being torn--and the\r\nshearer proceeds as upon the other, which finishes. He must then take\r\nthe sheep near to the door through which it is to pass out, and neatly\r\ntrim the legs, leaving not a solitary lock anywhere as a lodging-place\r\nfor ticks. It is absolutely necessary for him to remove from his stand\r\nto trim, otherwise the useless stuff from the legs becomes intermingled\r\nwith the fleece-wool. In the use of the shears, the blades should be\r\nlaid as flat to the skin as possible, the points not lowered too much,\r\nnor should more than from one to two inches be cut at a clip, and\r\nfrequently not so much, depending on the part, and the compactness of\r\nthe wool.\r\n\r\nThe wool should be cut off as close as conveniently practicable, and\r\neven. It may, indeed, be cut too close, so that the sheep can scarcely\r\navoid sun-scald; but this is very unusual. If the wool is left in\r\nridges, and uneven, it betrays a want of workmanship very distasteful to\r\nthe really good farmer. Great care should be taken not to cut the wool\r\ntwice in two, as inexperienced shearers are apt to do, since it is a\r\ngreat damage to the wool. This results from cutting too far from the\r\npoints of the shears, and suffering them to get too elevated. In such\r\ncases, every time the shears are pushed forward, the wool before, cut\r\noff by the points, say a quarter or three-eighths of an inch from the\r\nhide, is again severed. To keep the fleece entire, which is of great\r\nimportance to its good appearance when done up, and, therefore, to its\r\nsalableness, it is very essential that the sheep be held easily for\r\nitself, so that it will not struggle violently. No man can hold it still\r\nby main strength, and shear it well. The posture of the shearer should\r\nbe such that the sheep is actually confined to its position, so that it\r\nis unable to start up suddenly and tear its fleece; but it should not be\r\nconfined there by severe pressure or force, or it will be continually\r\nkicking and struggling. Clumsy, careless men, therefore, always complain\r\nof getting the most troublesome sheep. The neck, for example, may be\r\nconfined to the floor by placing it between the toe and knee of the leg\r\non which the shearer kneels; but the lazy or brutal shearer who suffers\r\nhis leg to rest directly on the neck, soon provokes that struggle which\r\nthe animal is obliged to make to free itself from severe pain, and even,\r\nperhaps, to draw its breath.\r\n\r\nGood shearers will shear, on the average, twenty-five Merinos per day;\r\nbut a new beginner should not attempt to exceed from one-third to\r\none-half of that number. It is the last process in the world which\r\nshould be hurried, as the shearer will, in that case, soon leave more\r\nthan enough wool on his sheep to pay for his day's wages. Wool ought not\r\nto be sheared, and must not be done up with any water in it. If wounds\r\nare made, as sometimes happens with unskilful operators, a mixture of\r\ntar and grease ought to be applied.\r\n\r\nShearing lambs is, in the Northern climate, at least, an unprofitable\r\npractice; since the lamb, at a year old, will give the same amount of\r\nwool, and it is thus stripped of its natural protection from cold when\r\nit is young and tender, for the mere pittance of the interest on a\r\npound, or a pound and a half of wool for six months, not more than two\r\nor three cents, and this all consumed by the expense of shearing. Much\r\nthe same may be said of the custom, which obtains in some places, of\r\nshearing from sheep twice a year. There may be a reason for it, where\r\nthey receive so little care that a portion are expected to disappear\r\nevery half year, and the wool to be torn from the backs of the remainder\r\nby bushes, thorns, etc., if left for a long period; but when sheep are\r\ninclosed, and treated as domestic animals, although there may be less\r\nbarbarity in shearing them in the fall also, than in the case of the\r\ntender lambs, there is no ground for it on the score of utility; since\r\nany gain accruing from it cannot pay the additional expense which it\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nCOLD STORMS occurring soon after shearing sometimes destroy sheep, in\r\nthe northern portions of the country, especially the delicate Saxons;\r\nforty or fifty of which have, at times, perished out of a single flock,\r\nfrom one night's exposure. Sheep, in such cases, should be housed; or,\r\nwhere this is impracticable, driven into dense forests.\r\n\r\nSUN-SCALD. When they are sheared close in very hot weather, have no\r\nshade in their pastures, and especially where they are driven\r\nimmediately considerable distances, or rapidly, over burning and dusty\r\nroads, their backs are sometimes so scorched by the sun that their wool\r\ncomes off. If let alone, the matter is not a serious one; but the\r\napplication of refuse lard to the back will hasten the cure, and the\r\nstarting of the wool.\r\n\r\nTICKS. These vermin, when very numerous, greatly annoy and enfeeble the\r\nsheep in winter, and should be kept entirely out of the flock. After\r\nshearing, the heat and cold, the rubbing and biting of the sheep, soon\r\ndrive off the tick, and it takes refuge in the wool of the lamb. Let a\r\nfortnight elapse after shearing, to allow all to make this change of\r\nresidence. Then boil refuse tobacco leaves until the decoction is strong\r\nenough to kill ticks beyond a peradventure, which may be ascertained by\r\nexperiment. Five or six pounds of cheap plug tobacco, or an equivalent\r\nin stems, and the like, may be made to answer for a hundred lambs.\r\n\r\nThis decoction is poured into a deep, narrow box, kept for the purpose,\r\nwhich has an inclined shelf on one side, covered with a wooden grate.\r\nOne man holds the lamb by its hind legs, while another clasps the fore\r\nlegs in one hand, and shuts the other about the nostrils, to prevent the\r\nliquid from entering them, and then the animal is entirely immersed. It\r\nis then immediately lifted out, laid on one side upon the grate, and the\r\nwater squeezed out of its wool, when it is turned over and squeezed on\r\nthe other side. The grate conducts the fluid back into the box. If the\r\nlambs are regularly dipped every year, ticks will never trouble a flock.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKING OR BRANDING.\r\n\r\nThe sheep should be marked soon after shearing, or mistakes may occur.\r\nEvery sheep-owner should be provided with a marking instrument, which\r\nwill stamp his initials, or some other distinctive mark, such as a small\r\ncircle, an oval, a triangle, or a square, at a single stroke, and with\r\nuniformity, on the sheep. It is customary to have the mark cut out of a\r\nplate of thin iron, with an iron handle terminating in wood; but one\r\nmade by cutting a type, or raised letter, or character, on the end of a\r\nstick of light wood, such as pine or basswood, is found to be better. If\r\nthe pigment used be thin, and the marker be thrust into it a little too\r\ndeeply, as often happens, the surplus will not run off from the wood, as\r\nit does from a thin sheet of iron, to daub the sides of the sheep, and\r\nspoil the appearance of the mark; and, if the pigment be applied hot,\r\nthe former will not get heated, like the latter, and increase the danger\r\nof burning the hide.\r\n\r\nVarious pigments are used for marking. Many boil tar until it assumes a\r\nglazed, hard consistency when cold, and give it a brilliant, black color\r\nby stirring in a little lampblack during the boiling. This is applied\r\nwhen just cold enough not to burn the sheep's hide, and it forms a\r\nbright, conspicuous mark all the year round. The manufacturer, however,\r\nprefers the substitution of oil and turpentine for tar, as the latter\r\nis cleansed out of the wool with some difficulty. It should be boiled in\r\nan iron vessel, with high sides, to prevent it from taking fire, on a\r\nsmall furnace or chafing-dish near which it is to be used. When cool\r\nenough, forty or fifty sheep can be marked before it gets too stiff. It\r\nis then warmed from time to time, as necessary, on the chafing-dish.\r\nPaint, made of lampblack, to which a little spirits of turpentine is\r\nfirst added, and then diluted with linseed or lard oil, is also used.\r\nThe rump is a better place to mark than the side, since it is there\r\nabout as conspicuous under any circumstances, and more so when the sheep\r\nare huddled in a pen, or running away from one. Besides, should any wool\r\nbe injured by the mark, that on the rump is less valuable than that on\r\nthe side. Ewes are commonly distinguished from wethers by marking them\r\non different sides of the rump.\r\n\r\nMany mark each sheep as it is discharged from the barn by the shearer;\r\nbut it consumes much less time to do it at a single job, after the\r\nshearing is completed; and it is necessary to take the latter course if\r\na hot pigment is used.\r\n\r\nMAGGOTS. Rams with horns growing closely to their heads are very liable\r\nto have maggots generated under them, particularly if the skin on the\r\nsurrounding parts becomes broken by fighting; and these, unless removed,\r\nsoon destroy the animal. Boiled tar, or the marking substance first\r\ndescribed, is both remedy and preventive. If it is put under the horns\r\nat the time of marking, no trouble will ever arise from this cause.\r\n\r\nSometimes when a sheep scours in warm weather, and clotted dung adheres\r\nabout the anus, maggots are generated under it, and the sheep perishes\r\nmiserably. As a preventive, the dung should be removed; as a remedy, the\r\ndung and maggots should be removed--the latter by touching them with a\r\nlittle turpentine--and sulphur and grease afterward applied to the\r\nexcoriated surface.\r\n\r\nMaggot-flies sometimes deposit their eggs on the backs of the long,\r\nopen-woolled English sheep, and the maggots, during the few days before\r\nthey assume the _pupa_ state, so tease and irritate the animal, that\r\nfever and death ensue. Tar and turpentine, or butter and sulphur,\r\nsmeared over the parts, are admirable preventives. The Merino and Saxon\r\nare exempt from these attacks.\r\n\r\nSHORTENING THE HORNS. A convolution of the horn of a ram sometimes so\r\npresses in upon the side of the head or neck that it is necessary to\r\nshave or rasp it away on the under side, to prevent ultimately fatal\r\neffects. The point of the horn of both ram and ewe both frequently turn\r\nin so that they will grow into the flesh, and sometimes into the eye,\r\nunless shortened. The toe-nippers will often suffice on the thin\r\nextremity of a horn; if not, a fine saw must be used. The marking-time\r\naffords the best opportunity for attending to this operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND DIVISION.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of annually weeding the flock, by excluding all its\r\nmembers falling below a certain standard of quality, and the points\r\nwhich should be regarded in fixing that standard, have already been\r\nbrought to notice in connection with the principles of breeding.\r\n\r\nThe time of shearing is by far the most favorable period for the\r\nflock-master to make his selection. He should be present on the\r\nshearing-floor, and inspect the fleece of every sheep as it is gradually\r\ntaken off; since, if there are faults about it, he will then discover it\r\nbetter than at any other time. A glance will likewise reveal to him\r\nevery defect in form, previously concealed, wholly, or in part, by the\r\nwool, as soon as the newly-shorn sheep is permitted to stand up on its\r\nfeet. A remarkably choice ewe is frequently retained until she dies of\r\nold age; a rather poor nurse or breeder is excluded for the slightest\r\nfault, and so on. Whatever animals are to be excluded, may be marked on\r\nthe shoulder with Venetian red and hog's lard, conveniently applied with\r\na brush or cob. Such of the wethers as have attained their prime, and\r\nthose ewes that have passed it, should be provided with the best feed,\r\nand fitted for the butcher. If they have been properly pushed on grass,\r\nthey will be in good flesh by the time they are taken from it; and, if\r\nnot intended for stall-feeding, the sooner they are then disposed of the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThose _divisions_, also, in large flocks, which utility demands, are\r\ngenerally made at or soon after shearing. Not more than two hundred\r\nsheep should be allowed to run together in the pastures; although the\r\nnumber might, perhaps, be safely increased to three hundred, if the\r\nrange is extensive.\r\n\r\nWethers and dry ewes to be turned off should be kept separate from the\r\nnursing-ewes; and if the flock is large enough to require a third\r\ndivision, it is customary to put the yearling and two-year-old ewes and\r\nwethers, and the old, feeble sheep together. It is better, in all cases,\r\nto separate the rams from all the other sheep at the time of shearing,\r\nand to inclose them in a field which is particularly well-fenced. If\r\nthey are put even with wethers, they are more quarrelsome; and when cool\r\nnights arrive, will worry themselves and waste their flesh in constant\r\nefforts to ride the wethers.\r\n\r\nThe Merino ram, although a quiet animal compared with the common-woolled\r\none, will be tempted to jump, by poor fences, or fences half the time\r\ndown; and if he is once taught this trick, he becomes very troublesome\r\nas the rutting period approaches, unless hoppling, yoking, clogging, or\r\npoking is resorted to, either of which causes him to waste his strength,\r\nbesides being the occasion of frequent accidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROOK.\r\n\r\nThis convenient implement for catching sheep is of the form represented\r\nin the cut accompanying, of three-eighths inch round iron, drawn smaller\r\ntoward the point, which is made safe by a knot. The other end is\r\nfurnished with a socket, which receives a handle six or eight feet long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEPHERD'S CROOK.]\r\n\r\nIn using it, the hind leg is hooked in from behind the sheep, and it\r\nfills up the narrow part beyond that point, while passing along it until\r\nit reaches the loop, when the animal is caught by the hook, and when\r\nsecured, its foot easily slips through the loop. Some caution is\r\nrequired in its use; for, should the animal give a sudden start forward\r\nto get away, the moment it feels the crook, the leg will be drawn\r\nforcibly through the narrow part, and strike the bone with such violence\r\nagainst the bend of the loop as to cause the animal considerable pain,\r\nand even occasion lameness for some days. On first embracing the leg,\r\nthe crook should be drawn quickly toward the shepherd, so as to bring\r\nthe bend of the loop against the leg as high up as the hock, before the\r\nsheep has time even to break off; and being secure, its struggles will\r\ncease the moment the hand seizes the leg.\r\n\r\nNo shepherd should be without this implement, as it saves much yarding\r\nand running, and leads to a prompt examination of every improper or\r\nsuspicious appearance, and a seasonable application of remedy or\r\npreventive, which would often be deferred if the whole flock had to be\r\ndriven to a distant yard to effect the catching of a single sheep.\r\n\r\nDexterity in its use is speedily acquired by any one; and if a flock are\r\nproperly tame, any one of its number can be readily caught by it at\r\nsalting-time, or, generally, at other times, by a person with whom the\r\nflock are familiar. It is, however, at the lambing-time, when sheep and\r\nlambs require to be so repeatedly caught, that the crook is more\r\nparticularly serviceable. For this purpose, at that time alone, it will\r\npay for itself ten times over in a single season, in saving time, to say\r\nnothing of the advantage of the sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIVING AND SLAUGHTERING.\r\n\r\nDRIVING. Mutton can be grown cheaper than any other kind of meat. It is\r\nfast becoming better appreciated; and, strange as it may seem, good\r\nmutton brings a higher price in our best markets than the same quality\r\ndoes in England. Its substitution in a large measure for pork would\r\ncontribute materially to the health of the community.\r\n\r\nWinter fattening of sheep may often be made very profitable and\r\ndeserves greater attention, especially where manure is an object; and\r\nthe instances are few, indeed, where it is not. In England, it is\r\nconsidered good policy to fatten sheep, if the increase of weight will\r\npay for the oil-cake or grain consumed; the manure being deemed a fair\r\nequivalent for the other food--that is, as much straw and turnips as\r\nthey will eat. Lean sheep there usually command as high a price per\r\npound in the fall as fatted ones in the spring; while, in this country,\r\nthe latter usually bear a much higher price, which gives the feeder a\r\ngreat advantage.\r\n\r\nThe difference may be best illustrated by a simple calculation. Suppose\r\na wether of a good mutton breed, weighing eighty pounds in the fall, to\r\ncost six cents per pound, amounting to four dollars and eighty cents,\r\nand to require twenty pounds of hay per week, or its equivalent in other\r\nfood, and to gain a pound and a half each week; the gain in weight in\r\nfour months would be about twenty-five pounds, which, at six cents per\r\npound, would be one dollar and fifty cents, or less than ten dollars per\r\nton for the hay consumed; but if the same sheep could be bought in the\r\nfall for three cents per pound, and sold in the spring for six cents,\r\nthe gain would amount to three dollars and ninety cents, or upwards of\r\ntwenty dollars per ton for the hay--the manure being the same in either\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nFor fattening, it is well to purchase animals as large and thrifty, and\r\nin as good condition as can be had at fair prices; and to feed\r\nliberally, so as to secure the most rapid increase that can be had\r\nwithout waste of food. The fattening of sheep by the aid of oil-cake, or\r\ngrain purchased for the purpose, may often be made a cheaper mode of\r\nobtaining manure than by the purchase of artificial fertilizers, as\r\nguano, super-phosphate of lime, and the like; and it is altogether\r\npreferable. It is practised extensively and advantageously abroad, and\r\ndeserves at least a fair trial among us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHEPHERD AND HIS FLOCK.]\r\n\r\nSheep which are to be driven to market should not begin their journey\r\neither when too full or too hungry; in the former state, they are apt to\r\npurge while on the road, and in the latter, they will lose strength at\r\nonce. The sheep selected for market should be those in the best\r\ncondition at the time; and to ascertain this, it is necessary to examine\r\nthe whole lot, and separate the fattest from the rest, which is best\r\ndone at about mid-day, before the sheep feed again in the afternoon. The\r\nselected ones are placed in a field by themselves, where they remain\r\nuntil the time for starting. If there be rough pasture to give them,\r\nthey should be allowed to use it, in order to rid themselves of some of\r\nthe food which might be productive of inconvenience on the journey. If\r\nthere is no such pasture, a few cut turnips will answer. All their\r\nhoofs should be carefully examined, and every unnecessary appendage\r\nremoved, though the firm portion of the horn should not be touched.\r\nEvery clotted piece of wool should also be removed with the shears, and\r\nthe animals properly marked.\r\n\r\nBeing thus prepared, they should have feed early in the morning, and be\r\nstarted, in the cold season, about mid-day. Let them walk quietly away;\r\nand as the road is new to them, they will go too fast at first, to\r\nprevent which, the drover should go before them, and let his dog bring\r\nup the rear. In a short time they will assume the proper speed--about\r\none mile an hour. Should the road they travel be a green one, they will\r\nproceed nibbling their way onward at the grass along both sides; but if\r\nit is a narrow turnpike, the drover will require all his attention in\r\nmeeting and being passed by various vehicles, to avoid injury to his\r\ncharge. In this part of their business, drovers generally make too much\r\nado; and the consequence is, that the sheep are driven more from side to\r\nside of the road than is requisite. Upon meeting a carriage, it would be\r\nmuch better for the sheep, were the drover to go forward, instead of\r\nsending his dog, and point off with his stick the leading sheep to the\r\nnearest side of the road; and the rest will follow, as a matter of\r\ncourse, while the dog walks behind the flock and brings up the\r\nstragglers. Open gates to fields are sources of great annoyance to\r\ndrovers, the stock invariably making an endeavor to go through them. On\r\nobserving an open gate ahead, the drover should send his dog behind him\r\nover the fence, to be ready to meet the sheep at the gate. When the\r\nsheep incline to rest, they should be allowed to lie down.\r\n\r\nWhen the animals are lodged for the night, a few turnips or a little hay\r\nshould be furnished to them, if the road-sides are bare. If these are\r\nplaced near the gate of the field which they occupy, they will be ready\r\nto take the road again in the morning. As a precaution against worrying\r\ndogs, the drover should go frequently through the flock with a light,\r\nretire to rest late, and rise up early in the morning. These precautions\r\nare necessary; since, when sheep have once been disturbed by dogs, they\r\nwill not settle again upon the road. The first day's journey should be a\r\nshort one, not exceeding four or five miles. The whole journey should be\r\nso marked out as that, allowance being made for unforeseen delays, the\r\nanimals may have one day's rest near the market.\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF FAT SHEEP. The formation of fat, in a sheep destined to be\r\nfattened, commences in the inside, the web of fat which envelopes the\r\nintestines being first formed, and a little deposited around the\r\nkidneys. After that, fat is seen on the outside; and first upon the end\r\nof the rump at the tail-head, continuing to move on along the back, on\r\nboth sides of the spine, or back-bone, to the bend of the ribs to the\r\nneck. Then it is deposited between the muscles, parallel with the\r\ncellular tissue. Meanwhile, it is covering the lower round of the ribs\r\ndescending to the flanks, until the two sides meet under the belly,\r\nwhence it proceeds to the brisket, or breast, in front, and the sham or\r\ncod behind, filling up the inside of the arm-pits and thighs. While all\r\nthese depositions are proceeding on the outside, the progress in the\r\ninside is not checked, but rather increased, by the fattening\r\ndisposition encouraged by the acquired condition; and, hence,\r\nsimultaneously, the kidneys become entirely covered, and the space\r\nbetween the intestines and the lumbar region, or loin, gradually filled\r\nup by the web and kidney fat.\r\n\r\nBy this time the cellular spaces around each fibre of muscle are\r\nreceiving their share; and when fat is deposited there in quantity, it\r\ngives to the meat the term _marbled_. These inter-fibrous spaces are the\r\nlast to receive a deposition of fat; but after this has begun, every\r\nother part at the same time receives its due share, the back and kidneys\r\nsecuring the most, so much so that the former literally becomes\r\n_nicked_, as it is termed--that is, the fat is felt through the skin to\r\nbe divided into two portions, from the tail-head along the back to the\r\ntop of the shoulder; and the tail becoming thick and stiff, the top of\r\nthe neck broad, the lower part of each side of the neck toward the\r\nbreasts full, and the hollows between the breast-bone and the inside of\r\nthe fore legs, and between the cod and the inside of the hind thighs,\r\nfilled up. When all this has been accomplished, the sheep is said to be\r\n_fat_, or _ripe_.\r\n\r\nWhen the body of a fat sheep is entirely overlaid with fat, it is in the\r\nmost valuable state as mutton. Few sheep, however, lay on fat entirely\r\nover their body; one laying the largest proportion on the rump, another\r\non the back; one on the parts adjoining the fore-quarter, another on\r\nthose of the hind-quarter; and one more on the inside, and another more\r\non the outside. Taking so many parts, and combining any two or more of\r\nthem together, a considerable variety of condition will be found in any\r\nlot of fat sheep, while any one is as ripe in its way as any other.\r\n\r\nWith these data for guides, the state of a sheep in its progress toward\r\nripeness may be readily detected by handling. A fat sheep, however, is\r\neasily known by the eye, from the fullness exhibited by all the\r\nexternal parts of the particular animal. It may exhibit want in some\r\nparts when compared with others; but those parts, it may easily be seen,\r\nwould never become so ripe as the others; and this arises from some\r\nconstitutional defect in the animal itself; since, if this were so,\r\nthere is no reason why all the parts should not be alike ripe. The state\r\nof a sheep that is obviously not ripe cannot altogether be ascertained\r\nby the eye. It must be handled, or subjected to the scrutiny of the\r\nhand. Even in so palpable an act as handling, discretion is requisite. A\r\nfull-looking sheep needs hardly to be handled on the rump; for he would\r\nnot seem so full, unless fat had first been deposited there. A\r\nthin-looking sheep, on the other hand, should be handled on the rump;\r\nand if there be no fat there, it is useless to handle the rest of the\r\nbody, for certainly there will not be so much as to deserve the name of\r\nfat. Between these two extremes of condition, every variety exists; and\r\non that account examination by the hand is the rule, and by the eye\r\nalone the exception. The hand is, however, much assisted by the eye,\r\nwhose acuteness detects deficiencies and redundancies at once.\r\n\r\nIn handling sheep, the points of the fingers are chiefly employed; and\r\nthe accurate knowledge conveyed by them, through practice, of the exact\r\nstate of the condition, is truly surprising, and establishes a\r\nconviction in the mind that some intimate relation exists between the\r\nexternal and internal state of an animal. Hence originates this\r\npractical maxim in judging stock of all kinds--that no animal will\r\nappear ripe to the eye, unless as much fat had previously been acquired\r\nin the inside as constitutional habit will allow.\r\n\r\nThe application of this rule is easy. When the rump is found nicked, on\r\nhandling, fat is to be found on the back; when the back is found nicked,\r\nfat is to be expected on the top of the shoulder and over the ribs; and\r\nwhen the top of the shoulder proves to be nicked, fat may be anticipated\r\non the under side of the belly, To ascertain its existence below, the\r\nanimal must be _turned up_, as it is termed; that is, the sheep is set\r\nupon his rump, with his back down, and his hind feet pointing upward and\r\noutward. In this position, it can be seen whether the breast and thighs\r\nare filled up. Still, all these alone would not disclose the state of\r\nthe inside of the sheep, which should, moreover, be looked for in the\r\nthickness of the flank; in the fullness of the breast, that is, the\r\nspace in front from shoulder to shoulder toward the neck; in the\r\nstiffness and thickness of the root of the tail; and in the breadth of\r\nthe back of the neck. All these latter parts, especially with the\r\nfullness of the inside of the thighs, indicate a fullness of fat in the\r\ninside; that is, largeness of the mass of fat on the kidneys, thickness\r\nof net, and thickness of layers between the abdominal muscles. Hence,\r\nthe whole object of feeding sheep on turnips and the like seems to be to\r\nlay fat upon all the bundles of fleshy fibres, called muscles, that are\r\ncapable of acquiring that substance; for, as to bone and muscle, these\r\nincrease in weight and extent independently of fat, and fat only\r\nincreases in their magnitude.\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTERING. Sheep are easily slaughtered, and the operation is\r\nunattended with cruelty. They require some preparation before being\r\ndeprived of life, which consists in food being withheld from them for\r\nnot less than twenty-four hours, according to the season. The reason for\r\nfasting sheep before slaughtering is to give time for the paunch and\r\nintestines to empty themselves entirely of food, as it is found that,\r\nwhen an animal is killed with a full stomach, the meat is more liable to\r\nputrefy, and it not so well flavored; and, as ruminating animals always\r\nretain a large quantity of food in their intestines, it is reasonable\r\nthat they should fast somewhat longer to get rid of it, than animals\r\nwith single stomachs.\r\n\r\nSheep are placed on their side--sometimes upon a stool, called a\r\nkilling-stool--to be slaughtered, and, requiring no fastening with\r\ncords, are deprived of life by the use of a straight knife through the\r\nneck, between its bone and the windpipe, severing the carotid artery and\r\nthe jugular vein of both sides, from which the blood flows freely out,\r\nand the animal soon dies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DROVER'S OR BUTCHER'S DOG.]\r\n\r\nThe skin, as far as it is covered with wool, is taken off, leaving that\r\non the legs and head, which are covered with hair, the legs being\r\ndisjointed by the knee. The entrails are removed by an incision along\r\nthe belly, after the carcass has been hung up by the tendons of the\r\nboughs. The net is carefully separated from the viscera, and rolled up\r\nby itself; but the kidney fat is not then extracted. The intestines are\r\nplaced on the inner side of the skin until divided into the _pluck_,\r\ncontaining the heart, lungs, and liver; the bag, containing the stomach;\r\nand the _puddings_, consisting of the viscera, or guts. The latter are\r\nusually thrown away; though the Scotch, however, clean them and work\r\nthem up into their favorite _haggis_. The skin is hung over a rope or\r\npole under cover, with the skin-side uppermost, to dry in an airy place.\r\n\r\nThe carcass should hang twenty-four hours in a clean, cool, airy, dry\r\napartment before it is cut down. It should be cool and dry; for, if\r\nwarm, the meat will not become firm; and, if damp, a clamminess will\r\ncover it, and it will never feel dry, and present a fresh, clean\r\nappearance. The carcass is divided in two, by being sawed right down the\r\nback-bone. The kidney-fat is then taken out, being only attached to the\r\nperitoneum by the cellular membrane, and the kidney is extracted from\r\nthe _suet_, the name given to sheep-tallow in an independent state.\r\n\r\nCUTTING UP. Of the two modes of cutting up a carcass of mutton, the\r\nEnglish and the Scotch--of the former, the practice in London being\r\ntaken as the standard, and of the latter, that of Edinburgh, since more\r\ncare is exercised in this respect in these two cities--the English is,\r\nperhaps, preferable; although the Scotch accomplish the task in a\r\ncleanly and workmanlike manner.\r\n\r\nThe _jigot_ is the most handsome and valuable part of the carcass,\r\nbringing the highest price, and is either a roasting or a boiling piece.\r\nA jigot of Leicester, Cheviot, or South-Down mutton makes a beautiful\r\nboiled leg of mutton, which is prized the more the fatter it is--this\r\npart of the carcass being never overloaded with fat. The _loin_ is\r\nalmost always roasted, the flap of the flank being skewered up, and it\r\nis a juicy piece. Many consider this piece of Leicester mutton, roasted,\r\nas too rich; and when warm this is, probably, the case; but a cold\r\nroast loin is an excellent summer dish. The _back-rib_ is divided into\r\ntwo, and used for very different purposes. The forepart--the neck--is\r\nboiled, and makes sweet barley-broth; and the meat, when boiled, or\r\nrather the whole simmered for a considerable time beside the fire, eats\r\ntenderly. The back-ribs make an excellent roast; indeed, there is not a\r\nsweeter or more varied one in the whole carcass, having both ribs and\r\nshoulder. The shoulder-blade eats best cold, and the ribs, warm. The\r\nribs make excellent chops, the Leicester and South-Down affording the\r\nbest. The _breast_ is mostly a roasting-piece, consisting of rib and\r\nshoulder, and is particularly good when cold. When the piece is large,\r\nas of the South-Down or Cheviot, the gristly parts of the ribs may be\r\ndivided from the true ribs, and helped separately. This piece also boils\r\nwell; or, when corned for eight days, and served with onion sauce, with\r\nmashed turnips in it, there are few more savory dishes at a farmer's\r\ntable. The _shoulder_ is separated before being dressed, and makes an\r\nexcellent roast for family use, being eaten warm or cold, or carved and\r\ndressed as the breast mentioned above. The shoulder is best from a large\r\ncarcass of South-Down, Cheviot, or Leicester. The _neck-piece_ is partly\r\nlaid bare by the removal of the shoulder, the forepart being fitted for\r\nboiling and making into broth, and the best part for roasting or\r\nbroiling into chops. On this account, it is a good family piece, and\r\ngenerally preferred to any part of the hind-quarter. Heavy sheep, such\r\nas the Leicester, South-Down, and Cheviot, supply the most thrifty\r\nneck-piece.\r\n\r\nRELATIVE QUALITIES. The different sorts of mutton in common use differ\r\nas well in quality as in quantity. The flesh of the _Leicester_ is\r\nlarge, though not coarse-grained, of a lively red color, and the\r\ncellular tissue between the fibres contains a considerable quantity of\r\nfat. When cooked, it is tender and juicy, yielding a red gravy, and\r\nhaving a sweet, rich taste; but the fat is rather too much and too rich\r\nfor some people's tastes, and can be put aside. It must be allowed that\r\nthe lean of fat meat is far better than lean meat that has never been\r\nfat. _Cheviot_ mutton is smaller in the grain, not so bright of color,\r\nwith less fat, less juice, not so tender and sweet; but the flavor is\r\nhigher, and the fat not so luscious. The mutton of _South-Downs_ is of\r\nmedium fineness in grain, color pleasant red, fat well intermixed with\r\nthe meat, juicy, and tenderer than Cheviot. The mutton of rams of any\r\nbreed is always hard, of disagreeable flavor, and, in autumn, not\r\neatable; that of old ewes is dry, hard, and tasteless; of young ones,\r\nwell enough flavored, but still rather dry; while wether-mutton is the\r\nmeat in perfection, according to its kind.\r\n\r\nThe want of relish, perhaps the distaste, for mutton has served as an\r\nobstacle to the extension of sheep husbandry in the United States. The\r\ncommon mistake in the management of mutton among us is, that it is\r\neaten, as a general thing, at exactly the wrong time after it is killed.\r\nIt should be eaten immediately after being killed, and, if possible,\r\nbefore the meat has time to get cold; or, if not, then it should be kept\r\na week or more--in the ice-house, if the weather require--until the time\r\nis just at hand when the fibre passes the state of toughness which it\r\ntakes on at first, and reaches that incipient or preliminary point in\r\nits process toward putrefaction when the fibres begin to give way, and\r\nthe meat becomes tender.\r\n\r\nAn opinion likewise generally prevails that mutton does not attain\r\nperfection in juiciness and flavor much under five years.\r\n\r\nIf this be so, that breed of sheep must be very unprofitable which takes\r\nfive years to attain its full state; and there is no breed of sheep in\r\nthis country which requires five years to bring it to perfection. This\r\nbeing the case, it must be folly to restrain sheep from coming to\r\nperfection until they have reached that age. Lovers of five-year-old\r\nmutton do not pretend that this course bestows profit on the farmer, but\r\nonly insist on its being best at that age. Were this the fact, one of\r\ntwo absurd conditions must exist in this department of agriculture:\r\nnamely, the keeping a breed of sheep that cannot, or that should not be\r\nallowed to, attain to perfection before it is five years old; either of\r\nwhich conditions makes it obvious that mutton cannot be in its _best_\r\nstate at five years.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the idea of mutton of this age being especially excellent,\r\nis founded on a prejudice, arising, probably, from this circumstance:\r\nbefore winter food was discovered, which could maintain the condition of\r\nstock which had been acquired in summer, sheep lost much of their summer\r\ncondition in winter, and, of course, an oscillation of condition\r\noccurred, year after year, until they attained the age of five years;\r\nwhen their teeth beginning to fail, would cause them to lose their\r\ncondition the more rapidly. Hence, it was expedient to slaughter them at\r\nnot exceeding five years of age; and, no doubt, mutton would be\r\nhigh-flavored at that age, that had been exclusively fed on natural\r\npasture and natural hay. Such treatment of sheep cannot, however, be\r\njustified on the principles of modern practice; because both reason and\r\ntaste concur in mutton being at its best whenever sheep attain their\r\nperfect state of growth and condition, not their largest and heaviest;\r\nand as one breed attains its perfect state at an earlier age than\r\nanother, its mutton attains its best before another breed attains what\r\nis its best state, although its sheep may be older; but taste alone\r\nprefers one kind of mutton to another, even when both are in their best\r\nstate, from some peculiar property. The cry for five-year-old mutton is\r\nthus based on very untenable grounds; the truth being that well-fed and\r\nfatted mutton is never better than when it gets its full growth in its\r\nsecond year; and the farmer cannot afford to keep it longer, unless the\r\nwool would pay for the keep, since we have not the epicures and men of\r\nwealth who would pay the butcher the extra price, which he must have, to\r\nenable him to pay a remunerating price to the grazier for keeping his\r\nsheep two or three years over.\r\n\r\nAll writers on diet agree in describing mutton as the most valuable of\r\nthe articles of human food. Pork may be more stimulating, beef perhaps\r\nmore nutritious, when the digestive powers are strong; but, while there\r\nis in mutton sufficient nutriment, there is also that degree of\r\nconsistency and readiness of assimilation which renders it most\r\ncongenial to the human stomach, most easy of digestion, and most\r\npromotive of human health. Of it, almost alone, can it be said that it\r\nis our food in sickness, as well as in health; its broth is the first\r\nthing, generally, that an invalid is permitted to taste, the first thing\r\nthat he relishes, and is a natural preparation for his return to his\r\nnatural aliment. In the same circumstances, it appears that fresh\r\nmutton, broiled or boiled, requires three hours for digestion; fresh\r\nmutton, roasted, three and one-fourth hours; and mutton-suet, boiled,\r\nfour and one-half hours.\r\n\r\nGood _ham_ may be made of any part of a carcass of mutton, though the\r\nleg is preferable; and for this purpose it is cut in the English\r\nfashion. It should be rubbed all over with good salt, and a little\r\nsaltpetre, for ten minutes, and then laid in a dish and covered with a\r\ncloth for eight or ten days. After that, it should be slightly rubbed\r\nagain, for about five minutes, and then hung up in a dry place, say the\r\nroof of the kitchen, until used. Wether mutton is used for hams, because\r\nit is fat, and it may be cured any time from November to May; but\r\nram-mutton makes the largest and highest-flavored ham, provided it be\r\ncured in spring, because it is out of season in autumn.\r\n\r\nThere is an infallible rule for ascertaining the _age_ of mutton by\r\ncertain marks on the carcass. Observe the color of the breast-bone, when\r\na sheep is dressed--that is, where the breast-bone is separated--which,\r\nin a lamb, or before it is one year old, will be quite red; from one to\r\ntwo years old, the upper and lower bone will be changing to white, and a\r\nsmall circle of white will appear round the edges of the other bones,\r\nand the middle part of the breast-bone will yet continue red; at three\r\nyears old, a very small streak of red will be seen in the middle of the\r\nfour middle bones, and the others will be white; and at four years, all\r\nthe breast-bone will be of a white or gristly color.\r\n\r\nCONTRIBUTIONS TO MANUFACTURES. The products of sheep are not merely\r\nuseful to man; they provide his luxuries as well. The skin of sheep is\r\nmade into _leather_, and, when so manufactured with the fleece on, makes\r\ncomfortable mats for the doors of rooms, and rugs for carriages. For\r\nthis purpose, the best skins are selected, and such as are covered with\r\nthe longest and most beautiful fleece. _Tanned sheep-skin_ is used in\r\ncoarse book-binding. _White sheep-skin_, which is not tanned, but so\r\nmanufactured by a peculiar process, is used as aprons by many classes of\r\nworkmen, and, in agriculture, as gloves in the harvest; and, when cut\r\ninto strips, as twine for sewing together the leather coverings and\r\nstuffings of horse-collars. _Morocco leather_ is made of sheep-skins, as\r\nwell as of goat-skins, and the bright red color is given to it by\r\ncochineal. _Russia leather_ is also made of sheep-skins, the peculiar\r\nodor of which repels insects from its vicinity, and resists the mould\r\narising from damp, the odor being imparted to it in currying, by the\r\nempyreumatic oil of the bark of the birch-tree. Besides soft leather,\r\nsheep-skins are made into a fine, flexible, thin substance, known by the\r\nname of _parchment_; and, though the skins of all animals might be\r\nconverted into writing materials, only those of the sheep and the\r\nshe-goat are used for parchment. The finer quality of the substance,\r\ncalled _vellum_, is made of the skins of kids and dead-born lambs; and\r\nfor its manufacture the town of Strasburgh has long been celebrated.\r\n\r\nMutton-suet is used in the manufacture of common _candles_, with a\r\nproportion of ox-tallow. Minced suet, subjected to the action of\r\nhigh-pressure steam in a digester, at two hundred and fifty or two\r\nhundred and sixty degrees of Fahrenheit, becomes so hard as to be\r\nsonorous when struck, whiter, and capable, when made into candles, of\r\ngiving very superior light. _Stearic candles_, the invention of the\r\ncelebrated Guy Lussac, are manufactured solely from mutton-suet.\r\n\r\nBesides the fat, the intestines of sheep are manufactured into various\r\narticles of luxury and utility, which pass under the absurd name of\r\n_catgut_. All the intestines of sheep are composed of four layers, as in\r\nthe horse and cattle. The outer, or _peritoneal_ one, is formed of that\r\nmembrane, by which every portion of the belly and its contents is\r\ninvested, and confined in its natural and proper situation. It is highly\r\nsmooth and polished, and secretes a watery fluid which contributes to\r\npreserve that smoothness, and to prevent all friction and concussion\r\nduring the different motions of the animal. The second is the _muscular_\r\ncoat, by means of which the contents of the intestines are gradually\r\npropelled from the stomach to the rectum, thence to be expelled when all\r\nthe useful nutriment is extracted. The muscles, as in all the other\r\nintestines, are disposed in two layers, the fibres of the outer coat\r\ntaking a longitudinal direction, and the inner layer being circular--an\r\narrangement different from that of the muscles of the [oe]sophagus, and\r\nin both beautifully adapted to the respective functions of the tube. The\r\n_submucous_ coat comes next. It is composed of numerous glands,\r\nsurrounded by cellular tissue, and by which the inner coat is\r\nlubricated, so that there may be no obstruction to the passage of the\r\nfood. The _mucous_ coat is the soft villous one lining the intestinal\r\ncavity. In its healthy state, it is always covered with mucus; and when\r\nthe glands beneath are stimulated, as under the action of physic, the\r\nquantity of mucus is increased; it becomes of a more watery character;\r\nthe contents of the intestines are softened and dissolved by it; and by\r\nmeans of the increased action of the muscular coat, which, as well as\r\nthe mucous one, feels the stimulus of the physic, the faeces are\r\nhurried on more rapidly and discharged.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of some sorts of _cords_ from the intestines of\r\nsheep, the outer peritoneal coat is taken off and manufactured into a\r\nthread to sew intestines, and make the cords of rackets and battledores.\r\nFuture washings cleanse the guts, which are then twisted into\r\ndifferent-sized cords for various purposes; some of the best known of\r\nwhich are whip-cords, hatter's cords for bow-strings, clock-maker's\r\ncords, bands for spinning-wheels, now almost obsolete, and fiddle and\r\nharp-strings. Of the last class, the cords manufactured in Italy are\r\nsuperior in goodness and strength; and the reason assigned is, that the\r\nsheep of that country are both smaller and leaner than the breeds most\r\nin vogue in England and in this country. The difficulty in manufacturing\r\nfrom other breeds of sheep lies, it seems, in making the treble strings\r\nfrom the fine peritoneal coat, their chief fault being weakness; by\r\nreason of which the smaller ones are hardly able to bear the stretch\r\nrequired for the higher notes in concert-pitch, maintaining, at the same\r\ntime, in their form and construction, that tenuity or smallness of\r\ndiameter which is required in order to produce a brilliant and clear\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND THEIR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dry and healthful climate, the rolling surface, and the sweet and\r\nvaried herbage, which generally prevail in the United States, insure\r\nperfect health to an originally sound and well-selected flock, unless\r\nthey are peculiarly exposed to disease. No country is better suited to\r\nsheep than most of the Northern and some of the Southern portions of our\r\nown. In Europe, and especially in England, where the system of\r\nmanagement is, necessarily, in the highest degree artificial,\r\nconsisting, frequently, in an early and continued forcing of the system,\r\nfolding on wet, ploughed ground, and the excessive use of that watery\r\nfood, the Swedish turnip, there are numerous and fatal diseases, a long\r\nlist of which invariably cumbers the pages of foreign writers on this\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe diseases incident to our flocks, on the contrary, may generally be\r\nconsidered as casualties, rather than as inbred, or necessarily arising\r\nfrom the quality of food, or from local causes. It may be safely\r\nasserted that, with a dry pasture, well stocked with varied and\r\nnutritious grasses; a clear, running stream; sufficient shade and\r\nprotection against severe storms; a constant supply of salt, tar, and\r\nsulphur in summer; good hay, and sometimes roots, with ample shelters in\r\nwinter--young sheep, originally sound and healthy, will seldom or never\r\nbecome diseased on American soil.\r\n\r\nThe comparatively few diseases, which it may be necessary here to\r\nmention, are arranged in alphabetical order--as in the author's \"Cattle\r\nand their Diseases\"--for convenience of reference, and treated in the\r\nsimplest manner. Remedies of general application, to be administered\r\noften by the unskilful and ignorant, must neither be elaborate nor\r\ncomplicated; and, if expensive, the lives of most sheep would be dearly\r\npurchased by their application.\r\n\r\nA sheep, which has been reared or purchased at the ordinary price, is\r\nthe only domestic animal which can die without material loss to its\r\nowner. The wool and felt will, in most instances, repay its cost, while\r\nthe carcass of other animals will be worthless, except for manure. The\r\nloss of sheep, from occasional disease, will leave the farmer's pocket\r\nin a very different condition from the loss of an equal value in horses\r\nor cattle. Humanity, however, alike with interest, dictates the use of\r\nsuch simple remedies, for the removal of suffering and disease, as may\r\nbe within reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTERING MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nThe stomach into which medicines are to be administered is the fourth,\r\nor digesting stomach. The comparatively insensible walls of the rumen,\r\nor paunch, are but slightly acted upon, except by doses of very improper\r\nmagnitude. Medicine, to reach the fourth stomach, should be given in a\r\nstate as nearly approaching fluidity as may be. Even then it may be\r\ngiven in such a manner as to defeat the object in view.\r\n\r\nIf the animal forcibly gulps fluids down, or if they are given hastily\r\nand bodily, they will follow the caul at the base of the gullet with\r\nconsiderable momentum, force asunder the pillars, and enter the rumen;\r\nif they are drunk more slowly, or administered gently, they will trickle\r\ndown the throat, glide over these pillars, and pass on through the\r\nmaniplus to the true stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the ears or tail, as is commonly practised, rarely\r\nextracts a quantity of blood sufficient to do any good where bleeding is\r\nindicated. To bleed from the eye-vein, the point of a knife is usually\r\ninserted near the lower extremity of the pouch below the eye, pressed\r\ndown, and then a cut made inward toward the middle of the face.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the angular or cheek-vein is recommended, in the lower\r\npart of the cheek, at the spot where the root of the fourth tooth is\r\nplaced, which is the thickest part of the cheek, and is marked on the\r\nexternal surface of the bone of the upper jaw by a tubercle,\r\nsufficiently prominent to be very sensible to the finger when the skin\r\nof the cheek is touched. This tubercle is a certain index to the\r\nangular vein, which is placed below. The shepherd takes the sheep\r\nbetween his legs; his left hand more advanced than his right, which he\r\nplaces under the head, and grasps the under jaw near to the hinder\r\nextremity, in order to press the angular vein, which passes in that\r\nplace, for the purpose of making it swell; he touches the right cheek at\r\nthe spot nearly equidistant from the eye and mouth, and there finds the\r\ntubercle which is to guide him, and also feels the angular vein swelled\r\nbelow this tubercle; he then makes the incision from below upward, half\r\na finger's breadth below the middle of the tubercle. When the vein is no\r\nlonger pressed upon, the bleeding will commonly cease; if not, a pin may\r\nbe passed through the lips of the orifice, and a lock of wool tied round\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nFor thorough bleeding, the jugular vein is generally to be preferred.\r\nThe sheep should be firmly held by the head by an assistant, and the\r\nbody confined between his knees, with its rump against a wall. Some of\r\nthe wool is then cut away from the middle of the neck over the jugular\r\nvein, and a ligature, brought in contact with the neck by opening the\r\nwool, is tied around it below the shorn spot near the shoulder. The vein\r\nwill soon rise. The orifice may be secured, after bleeding, as before\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe good effects of bleeding depend almost as much on the _rapidity_\r\nwith which the blood is abstracted, as the _amount_ taken. This is\r\nespecially true in acute diseases. _Either bleed rapidly or do not bleed\r\nat all._ The orifice in the vein, therefore, should be of some length,\r\nand made lengthwise with the vein. A lancet is by far the best\r\nimplement; and even a short-pointed penknife is preferable to the\r\nbungling gleam. Bleeding, moreover, should always be resorted to, when\r\nit is indicated at all, as nearly as possible to the _commencement_ of\r\nthe malady.\r\n\r\nThe amount of blood drawn should never be determined by admeasurement,\r\nbut by constitutional effect--the lowering of the pulse, and indications\r\nof weakness. In urgent cases--apoplexy, or cerebral inflammation, for\r\nexample--it would be proper to bleed until the sheep staggers or falls.\r\nThe quantity of blood in the sheep is less, in comparison, than that in\r\nthe horse or ox. The blood of the horse constitutes about one-eighteenth\r\npart of his weight; and that of the ox at least one-twentieth; while\r\nthat of the sheep, in ordinary condition, is one-twenty-second. For this\r\nreason, more caution should be exercised in bleeding the latter,\r\nespecially in frequently resorting to it; otherwise, the vital powers\r\nwill be rapidly and fatally prostrated. Many a sheep has been destroyed\r\nby bleeding freely in disorders not requiring it, and in disorders which\r\ndid require it at the commencement, but of which the inflammatory stage\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEELING THE PULSE.\r\n\r\nThe number of pulsations can be determined by feeling the heart beat on\r\nthe left side. The femoral artery passes in an oblique direction across\r\nthe inside of the thigh, and about the middle of the thigh its\r\npulsations and the character of the pulse can be most readily noted. The\r\npulsations per minute, in a healthy adult sheep, are sixty-five in\r\nnumber; though they have been stated at seventy, and even seventy-five.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOPLEXY.\r\n\r\nSoon after the sheep are turned to grass in the spring, one of the\r\nbest-conditioned sheep in the flock is sometimes suddenly found dead.\r\nThe symptoms which precede the catastrophe are occasionally noted. The\r\nsheep leaps frantically into the air two or three times, dashes itself\r\non the ground, and suddenly rises, and dies in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nWhere animals in somewhat poor condition are rather forced forward for\r\nthe purpose of raising their condition, it sometimes happens that they\r\nbecome suddenly blind and motionless; they will not follow their\r\ncompanions; when approached, they run about, knocking their heads\r\nagainst fences, etc.; the head is drawn round toward one side; they\r\nfall, grind their teeth, and their mouths are covered with a frothy\r\nmucus. Such cases are, unquestionably, referable to a determination of\r\nblood to the brain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ If the eyes are prominent and fixed, the membranes of the\r\nmouth and nose highly florid, the nostrils highly dilated, and the\r\nrespiration labored and stertorous, the veins of the head turgid, the\r\npulse strong and rather slow, and these symptoms attended by a partial\r\nor entire loss of sight and hearing, it is one of those decided cases of\r\napoplexy which require immediate and energetic treatment. Recourse\r\nshould at once be had to the jugular vein, and the animal bled until an\r\nobvious constitutional effect is produced--the pulse lowered, and the\r\nrigidity of the muscles relaxed. An aperient should at once follow\r\nbleeding; and if the animal is strong and plathoric, a sheep of the size\r\nof the Merino would require at least two ounces of Epsom salts, and one\r\nof the large mutton sheep, more. If this should fail to open the\r\nbowels, half an ounce of the salts should be given, say twice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAXY.\r\n\r\nThis is manifested by uneasiness; loathing of food; frequent drinking;\r\ncarrying the head down; drawing the back up; swollen belly; feverish\r\nsymptoms; and avoidance of the flock. It appears mostly in late autumn\r\nand spring, and may be induced by exposure to severe storms, plunging in\r\nwater when hot, and especially by constipation, brought on by feeding on\r\nfrostbitten, putrid, or indigestible herbage. Many sheep die on the\r\nprairies from this disease, induced by exposure and miserable forage.\r\nEntire prevention is secured by warm, dry shelters, and nutritious, dry\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Remedies, to be successful, must be promptly applied. Bleed\r\nfreely; and to effect this, immersion in a tub of hot water may be\r\nnecessary, in consequence of the stagnant state of the blood. Then give\r\ntwo ounces of Epsom salts, dissolved in warm water, with a handful of\r\ncommon salt. If this is unsuccessful, give a clyster, made with a\r\npipeful of tobacco, boiled for a few minutes in a pint of water.\r\nAdminister half; and if this is not effectual, follow with the\r\nremainder. Then bed the animal in dry straw, and cover with blankets;\r\nassisting the purgatives with warm gruels, followed by laxative\r\nprovender till well.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nWhere sheep are subject to pneumonia, they are liable to bronchitis as\r\nwell, which is an inflammation of the mucous membrane, which lines the\r\nbronchial tubes, or the air-passages of the lungs. The _symptoms_ are\r\nthose of an ordinary cold, but attended with more fever, and a\r\ntenderness of the throat and belly when pressed upon.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Administer salt in doses of from one and a half to two\r\nounces, with six or eight ounces of lime-water, given in some other part\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH.\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane, which lines the nasal\r\npassages, and it sometimes extends to the larynx and pharynx. In the\r\nfirst instance--where the lining of the nasal passages is alone and not\r\nvery violently affected--it is merely accompanied by an increased\r\ndischarge of mucus, and is rarely attended with much danger. In this\r\nform, it is usually termed _snuffles_; and high-bred English\r\nmutton-sheep, in this country, are apt to manifest more or less of it,\r\nafter every sudden change of weather. When the inflammation extends to\r\nthe mucous lining of the larynx and the pharynx, some degree of fever\r\nusually supervenes, accompanied by cough, and some loss of appetite. At\r\nthis point, bleeding and purging are serviceable.\r\n\r\nCatarrh rarely attacks the American fine-woolled sheep with sufficient\r\nviolence in summer to require the application of remedies. Depletion, in\r\ncatarrh, in our severe winter months, however, rapidly produces that\r\nfatal prostration, from which it is almost impossible to bring the sheep\r\nback, without bestowing an amount of time and care upon it, costing far\r\nmore than the worth of an ordinary animal.\r\n\r\nThe best course is to _prevent_ the disease by judicious precaution.\r\nWith that amount of attention which every prudent farmer should bestow\r\non his sheep, the American Merino is but little subject to it. Good,\r\ncomfortable, and well-ventilated shelters, constantly accessible to the\r\nsheep in winter, with a sufficiency of food regularly administered, are\r\nusually a sufficient safeguard.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIGNANT EPIZOOeTIC CATARRH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN ENGLISH RACK FOR FEEDING SHEEP.]\r\n\r\nEssentially differing, in type and virulence, from the preceding, is an\r\nepidemic, or, more properly speaking, an epizooetic malady, which, as\r\noften as once in every eight or ten years, sweeps over extended sections\r\nof the Northern States, destroying more sheep than all other diseases\r\ncombined. It commonly makes its appearance in winters characterized by\r\nrapid and violent changes of temperature, which are spoken of by the\r\nfarmers as \"bad winters\" for sheep. The disease is sometimes termed the\r\n\"distemper,\" and also, but erroneously, \"grub in the head.\" The winter\r\nof 1846-7 proved peculiarly destructive to sheep in New York, and some\r\nof the adjoining States; some owners losing one-half, others\r\nthree-quarters, and a few seven-eighths, of their flocks. One person\r\nlost five hundred out of eight hundred; another, nine hundred out of a\r\nthousand. These severe losses, however, mainly fell on the holders of\r\nthe delicate Saxons, and perhaps, generally, on those possessing not the\r\nbest accommodations, or the greatest degree of energy and skill.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The primary and main disease, in such instances, is a\r\nspecies of catarrh; differing, however, from ordinary catarrh in its\r\ndiagnosis, and in the extent of the lesions accompanying both the\r\nprimary and the symptomatic diseases. The animals affected do not,\r\nnecessarily, at first show any signs of violent colds, as coughing,\r\nsneezing, or labored respiration; the only indications of catarrh\r\nnoticed, oftentimes, being a nasal discharge. Animals having this\r\ndischarge appear dull and drooping; their eyes run a little, and are\r\npartially closed; the caruncle and lids look pale; their movements are\r\nlanguid, and there is an indisposition to eat; the pulse is nearly\r\nnatural, though at times somewhat too languid. In a few days these\r\nsymptoms are evidently aggravated; there is rapid emaciation,\r\naccompanied with debility; the countenance is exceedingly dull and\r\ndrooping; the eye is kept more than half closed; the caruncle, lids,\r\netc., are almost bloodless; a gummy, yellow secretion about the eye;\r\nthick, glutinous mucus adhering in and about the nostrils; appetite\r\nfeeble; pulse languid; and muscular energy greatly prostrated. They\r\nrapidly grow weaker, stumble, and fall as they walk, and soon become\r\nunable to rise; the appetite grows feebler; the mucus at the nose is, in\r\nsome instances, tinged with dark, grumous blood; the respiration becomes\r\noppressed; and the animals die within a day or two after they become\r\nunable to rise. Upon a _post-mortem_ examination, the mucous membrane\r\nlining the whole nasal cavity is found highly congested and thickened\r\nthroughout its entire extent, accompanied with the most intense\r\ninflammation; slight ulcers are found on the membranous lining, at the\r\njunction of the cellular ethmoid bones with the cribriform plate, in the\r\nethmoidal cells; and the inflammation extends to the mucous membrane of\r\nthe pharynx, and some inches, from two to four, of the upper portion of\r\nthe [oe]sophagus.\r\n\r\nNo sheep, affected with this disease, recovers after emaciation and\r\ndebility have proceeded to any great extent. In the generality of\r\ninstances, the time, from the first observed symptoms until death,\r\nvaries from ten to fifteen days; although death, in some cases, results\r\nmore speedily.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Nothing has been found so serviceable as mercury, which,\r\nfrom its action on the entire secretory system, powerfully tends to\r\nrelieve the congested membranes of the head. Dissolve one grain of\r\nbi-chloride of mercury--corrosive sublimate--in two ounces of water; and\r\ngive one-half ounce of the water, or one-eighth of a grain of corrosive\r\nsublimate, daily, in two doses. To stimulate and open the bowels, give,\r\nalso, rhubarb in a decoction, the equivalent of ten or fifteen grains at\r\na dose, accompanied with the ordinary carminative and stomachic\r\nadjuvants, ginger and gentian in infusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLIC.\r\n\r\nSheep are occasionally seen, particularly in the winter, lying down and\r\nrising every moment or two, and constantly stretching their fore and\r\nhind legs so far apart that their bellies almost touch the ground. They\r\nappear to be in much pain, refuse all food, and not unfrequently die,\r\nunless relieved. This disease, popularly known as the \"stretches,\" is\r\nerroneously attributed to an involution of the part of the intestine\r\nwithin another; it being, in reality, a species of flatulent colic,\r\ninduced by costiveness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Half an ounce of Epsom salts, a drachm of Jamaica ginger,\r\nand sixty drops of essence of peppermint. The salts alone, however, will\r\neffect the cure; as will, also, an equivalent dose of linseed oil, or\r\neven hog's lard.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty is removed by giving two table-spoonfuls of castor oil\r\nevery twelve hours, till the trouble ceases; or give one ounce of Epsom\r\nsalts. This may be assisted by an injection of warm weak suds and\r\nmolasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRH[OE]A.\r\n\r\nCommon diarrh[oe]a--purging, or scours--manifests itself simply by the\r\ncopiousness and fluidity of the alvine evacuations. It is generally\r\nowing to improper food, as bad hay, or noxious weeds; to a sudden\r\nchange, as from dry food to fresh grass; to an excess, as from\r\noverloading the stomach; and sometimes to cold and wet. It is important\r\nto clearly distinguish this disease from dysentery. In diarrh[oe]a,\r\nthere is no apparent general fever; the appetite remains good; the\r\nstools are thin and watery, but unaccompanied with slime, or mucus, and\r\nblood; odor of the faeces is far less offensive than in dysentery; and\r\nthe general condition of the animal is but little changed. When it is\r\nlight, and not of long continuance, no remedy is called for, since it is\r\na healthful provision of Nature for the more rapid expulsion of some\r\noffending matter in the system, which, if retained, might lead to\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Confinement to dry food for a day or two, and a gradual\r\nreturn to it, often suffices, in the case of grown sheep. With lambs,\r\nespecially if attacked in the fall, the disease is more serious. If the\r\npurging is severe, and especially if any mucus is observed with the\r\nfaeces, the feculent matter should be removed from the bowels by a gentle\r\ncathartic; half a drachm of rhubarb, or an ounce of linseed oil, or half\r\nan ounce of Epsom salts to a lamb. This should be followed by an\r\nastringent; and, in nine cases out of ten, the latter will serve in the\r\nfirst instance. Give one quarter of an ounce of prepared chalk in half a\r\npint of tepid milk, once a day for two or three days; at the end of\r\nwhich, and frequently after the first dose, the purging will have\r\nordinarily abated, or entirely ceased.\r\n\r\n\"Sheep's cordial\" is also a safe and excellent remedy--in severe cases,\r\nbetter than simple chalk and milk. Take of prepared chalk, one ounce;\r\npowdered catechu, half an ounce; powdered Jamaica ginger, two drachms;\r\nand powdered opium, half a drachm; mix with half a pint of peppermint\r\nwater; give two or three table-spoonfuls morning and night to a grown\r\nsheep, and half that quantity to a lamb.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASE OF THE BIFLEX CANAL.\r\n\r\nFrom the introduction of foreign bodies into the biflex canal, or\r\nfrom other causes, it occasionally becomes the seat of inflammation.\r\nThis canal is a small orifice, opening externally on the point of each\r\npastern, immediately above the cleft between the toes. It bifurcates\r\nwithin, a tube passing down on each side of the inner face of the\r\npastern, winding round and ending in a _cul de sac_. Inflammation\r\nof this canal causes an enlargement and redness of the pastern,\r\nparticularly about the external orifice of the canal. The toes are\r\nthrown wide apart by the tumor. It rarely attacks more than one foot,\r\nand should not be allowed to proceed to the point of ulceration\r\nwhich it will do, if neglected. There is none of that soreness and\r\ndisorganization between the back part of the toes, and none of that\r\npeculiar fetor which distinguishes the hoof-ail, with which disease it\r\nis sometimes confounded.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Scarify the coronet, making one or two deeper incisions in\r\nthe principal swelling around the mouth of the canal; and cover the foot\r\nwith tar.\r\n\r\n\r\nDYSENTERY.\r\n\r\nThis is occasioned by an inflammation of the mucous or inner coat of the\r\nlarger intestines, causing a preternatural increase in their secretions,\r\nand a morbid alteration in their character. It is frequently consequent\r\non that form of diarrh[oe]a, which is caused by an inflammation of the\r\nmucous coat of the smaller intestines. The inflammation extends\r\nthroughout the whole alimentary canal, increases in virulence, and\r\nbecomes dysentery, a disease frequently dangerous and obstinate in its\r\ncharacter, but, fortunately, not common among sheep, generally, in the\r\nUnited States. Its diagnosis differs from that of diarrh[oe]a, in\r\nseveral readily observed particulars. There is evident fever; the\r\nappetite is capricious, commonly very feeble; the stools are as thin as\r\nin diarrh[oe]a, or even thinner, but much more adhesive, in consequence\r\nof the presence of large quantities of mucus. As the erosion of the\r\nintestines advances, the faeces are tinged with blood; their odor is\r\nintolerably offensive; and the animal rapidly wastes away, the course of\r\nthe disease extending from a few days to several weeks.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Moderate bleeding should be resorted to, in the first or\r\ninflammatory shape, or whenever decided febrile symptoms are found to be\r\npresent. Two doses of physic having been administered, astringents are\r\nserviceable. The \"sheep's cordial,\" already described, is as good as\r\nany; and to this, tonics may soon begin to be added; an additional\r\nquantity of ginger may enter into the composition of the cordial, and\r\ngentian powder will be an useful auxiliary. With this, as an excellent\r\nstimulus to cause the sphincter of the anus to contract, and also the\r\nmouths of the innumerable secretory and exhalent vessels opening on the\r\ninner surface of the intestines, a half grain of strychnine may be\r\ncombined. Smaller doses should be given for three or four days.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLIES.\r\n\r\nThe proper treatment, upon the appearance of flies or maggots, has\r\nalready been detailed under the head of \"FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT,\" to\r\nwhich the reader is referred.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOULS.\r\n\r\nSheep are much less subject to this disease than cattle are; but\r\nencounter it, if kept in wet, filthy yards, or on moist, poachy ground.\r\nIt is an irritation of the integument in the cleft of the foot, slightly\r\nresembling incipient hoof-ail, and producing lameness. It occasions,\r\nhowever, no serious structural disorganization, disappears without\r\ntreatment, is not contagious, and appears in the wet weather of spring\r\nand fall, instead of in the dry, hot period of summer, when the hoof-ail\r\nrages most. A little solution of blue vitriol, or a little spirits of\r\nturpentine--either followed by a coating of warm tar--promptly cures it.\r\n\r\nFor foul noses, dip a small swab in tar, then roll it in salt; put some\r\non the nose, and compel the sheep to swallow a small quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES.\r\n\r\nIf there be no wound of the soft parts, the bone simply being broken,\r\nthe treatment is extremely easy. Apply a piece of wet leather, taking\r\ncare to ease the limb when swelling supervenes. When the swelling is\r\nconsiderable, and fever present, the best course is to open a vein of\r\nthe head or neck, allowing a quantity of blood to escape, proportioned\r\nto the size and condition of the animal, and the urgency of the\r\nsymptoms. Purgatives in such cases should never be neglected. Epsom\r\nsalts, in ounce doses, given either as a gruel or a drench, will be\r\nfound to answer the purpose well. If the broken bones are kept steady,\r\nthe cure will be complete in from three to four weeks, the process of\r\nreunion always proceeding faster in a young than in an old sheep. Should\r\nthe soft parts be injured to any extent, or the ends of the bone\r\nprotrude, recovery is very uncertain; and it will become a question\r\nwhether it would not be better to convert the animal at once into\r\nmutton.\r\n\r\n\r\nGARGET.\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of the udder, sometimes known as \"caked bag,\"\r\nwith or without general inflammation. Where it is simply an inflammation\r\nof the udder, it is usually caused by too great an accumulation of milk\r\nin the latter prior to lambing, or in consequence of the death of the\r\nlamb.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Drawing the milk partly from the bag, so that the hungry\r\nlamb will butt and work at it an unusual time in pursuit of its food,\r\nand bathing it a few times in _cold_ water, usually suffices. If the\r\nlamb is dead, the milk should be drawn a few times, at increasing\r\nintervals, washing the udder for some time in cold water at each\r\nmilking. In cases of obdurate induration, the udder should be anointed\r\nwith iodine ointment. If there is general fever in the system, an ounce\r\nof Epsom salts may be given. If suppuration forms, the part affected\r\nshould be opened with the lancet.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOITRE.\r\n\r\nThe \"swelled neck\" in lambs is, like the goitre, or bronchocele, an\r\nenlargement of the thyroid glands, and is strikingly analogous to that\r\ndisease, if not identical with it. It is congenital. The glands at birth\r\nare from the size of a pigeon's egg to that of a hen's _egg_, though\r\nmore elongated and flattened than an egg in their form. The lamb is\r\nexceedingly feeble, and often perishes almost without an effort to suck.\r\nMany even make no effort to rise, and die as soon as they are dropped.\r\nIt is rare, indeed, that one lives.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of lambs annually perish from this disease, which\r\ndoes not appear to be an epizooetic, though it is more prevalent in some\r\nseasons than in others. It does not seem to depend upon the water, or\r\nany other natural circumstances of a region, as goitre is generally\r\nsupposed to, since it may not prevail in the same flock, or on the same\r\nfarm, once in ten years; nor can it be readily traced to any particular\r\nkind of food. When it does appear, however, its attacks are rarely\r\nisolated; from which circumstance some have inferred that it is induced\r\nby some local or elimentary cause. Losses from this disease have ranged\r\nfrom ten per cent. to twenty, thirty, and even fifty per cent. of the\r\nwhole number of lambs. Possibly, high condition in the ewes may be one\r\nof the inducing causes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ None is known which will reach the case. Should one having\r\nthe disease chance to live, it would scarcely be worth while to attempt\r\nreducing the entanglement of the glands. Perhaps keeping the\r\nbreeding-ewes uniformly in fair, plump, but not _high_ condition, would\r\nbe as effectual a preventive as any.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRUB IN THE HEAD.\r\n\r\nWhat is popularly known as the \"grub\" is the larva of the _[oe]strus\r\noris_, or gad-fly of the sheep. It is composed of five rings; is\r\ntiger-colored on the back and belly, sprinkled with spots and patches of\r\nbrown; its wings are striped.\r\n\r\nThe sheep gad-fly is led by instinct to deposit its eggs within the\r\nnostrils of the sheep. Its attempts to do this--most common in July,\r\nAugust, and September--are always indicated by the sheep, which collect\r\nin close clumps, with their heads inward, and their noses thrust close\r\nto the ground, and into it, if any loose dirt or sand is within reach.\r\nIf the fly succeeds in depositing its egg, the latter is immediately\r\nhatched by the warmth and moisture of the part, and the young grubs, or\r\nlarvae, crawl up the nose, finding their devious way to the sinuses,\r\nwhere, by means of their tentaculae, or feelers, they attach themselves\r\nto the mucous membrane lining those cavities. During the ascent of the\r\nlarvae, the sheep stamps, tosses its head violently, and often dashes\r\naway from its companions wildly over the field. The larvae remain on the\r\nsinuses, feeding on the mucus secreted by the membrane, and apparently\r\ncreating no further annoyance, until ready to assume their _pupa_ form\r\nin the succeeding spring.\r\n\r\nHaving remained in the sinuses during the fall and winter, they abandon\r\nthem as the warm weather approaches in the latter part of spring. They\r\ncrawl down the nose, creating even greater irritation and excitement\r\nthan when they originally ascended, drop on the ground, and rapidly\r\nburrow into it. In a few hours, the skin of the larvae has contracted,\r\nbecome of a dark-brown color, and it has assumed the form of chrysalis.\r\nThis fly never eats; the male, after impregnating two or three females,\r\ndies; and the latter, having deposited their _ova_ in the nostrils of\r\nthe sheep, also soon perish.\r\n\r\nThe larvae in the heads of sheep may, and probably do, add to the\r\nirritation of those inflammatory diseases, such as catarrh, which attack\r\nthe membranous lining of the nasal cavities; and they are a powerful\r\nsource of momentary irritation in the first instance, when ascending to,\r\nand descending from, their lodging-place in the head. But in the\r\ninterval between these events, extending over a period of several\r\nmonths, not a movement of the sheep indicates the least annoyance at\r\ntheir presence. They are, moreover, found in the heads of nearly all\r\nsheep, the healthy as well as the diseased, at the proper season.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Though the presence of the grub constitutes no disease,\r\nsome think it well to diminish their number by all convenient means. One\r\nsimple way of effecting this is, by turning up with a plough a furrow of\r\nearth in the sheep-pasture, into which the sheep will thrust their noses\r\non the approach of the _[oe]strus_, and thus many of them escape its\r\nattacks. Some farmers smear the noses of their sheep occasionally With\r\ntar, the odor of which is believed to repel the fly. Another plan,\r\ndeemed efficacious in dislodging the larvae from the sinuses, is as\r\nfollows: Take half a pound of good Scotch snuff, and two quarts of\r\nboiling water; stir, and let it stand till cold. Inject about a\r\ntable-spoonful of this liquid and sediment up each nostril, with a\r\nsyringe; repeat this three or four times, at intervals, from the middle\r\nof October till January. The efficacy of the snuff will be increased by\r\nadding half an ounce of asaf[oe]tida, pounded in a little water. The\r\neffects on the sheep are immediate prostration and apparent death; but\r\nthey will soon recover. A decoction of tobacco affords a substitute for\r\nsnuff; and some recommend blowing tobacco smoke through the tail of a\r\npipe into each nostril.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOF-AIL.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of this troublesome malady, known, likewise, as\r\nfoot-ail, which is ordinarily noticed, is a lameness of one or both of\r\nthe fore-feet. On daily examining, however, the feet of a flock which\r\nhave the disease among them, it will readily be seen that the lesions\r\nmanifest themselves for several days before they are followed with\r\nlameness.\r\n\r\nThe horny covering of the sheep's foot extends up, gradually thinning\r\nout, some way between the toes and divisions of the hoof, and above\r\nthese horny walls the cleft is lined with skin. When the points of the\r\ntoes are spread apart, this skin is shown in front, covered with short,\r\nsoft hair. The back part of the toes, or the heels, can be separated\r\nonly to a little distance, and the skin in the cleft above them is\r\nnaked. In a healthy foot, the skin throughout the whole cleft is as\r\nfirm, dry, and uneroded as on any other part of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of hoof-ail is a slight erosion, accompanied with\r\ninflammation and heat of the naked skin in the _back parts_ of the\r\nclefts, immediately above the heels. The skin assumes a macerated\r\nappearance, and is kept moist by the presence of a sanious discharge\r\nfrom the ulcerated surface. As the inflammation extends, the friction of\r\nthe parts causes pain, and the sheep limps. At this stage, the foot,\r\n_externally_, in a great majority of cases, exhibits not the least trace\r\nof disease, with the exception of a slight redness, and sometimes the\r\nappearance of a small sore at the upper edge of the cleft, when viewed\r\nfrom behind.\r\n\r\nThe ulceration of the surface rapidly extends. The thin upper edges of\r\nthe inner walls of the hoof are disorganized, and an ulceration is\r\nestablished between the hoof and the fleshy sole. A purulent fetid\r\nmatter is discharged from the cavity. The extent of the separation\r\nincreases daily, and the ulcers also form sinuses deep into the fleshy\r\nsole. The bottom of the hoof disappears, eaten away by the acrid matter,\r\nand the outer walls, entirely separated from the flesh, hang only by\r\ntheir attachments at the coronet. The whole fleshy sole is now entirely\r\ndisorganized, and the entire foot is a mass of black, putrid\r\nulceration; or, as more commonly happens, the fly has struck it, and a\r\ndense mass of writhing maggots cover the surface, and burrow in every\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nThe fore-feet are generally first attacked; and, most usually but one of\r\nthem. The animal at first manifests but little constitutional\r\ndisturbance, and eats as usual. By the time that any considerable\r\ndisorganization of the structures has taken place in the first foot, and\r\nsometimes sooner, the other forefoot is attacked. That becoming as lame\r\nas the first, the miserable animal seeks its food on its knees; and, if\r\nforced to rise, its strange, hobbling gait betrays the intense agony\r\noccasioned by bringing its feet in contact with the ground. There is a\r\nbare spot under the brisket, of the size of a man's hand, which looks\r\nred and inflamed. There is a degree of general fever, and the appetite\r\nis dull. The animal rapidly loses condition. The appearance of the\r\nmaggot soon closes the scene. Where the rotten foot is brought in\r\ncontact with the side, in lying down, the filthy, ulcerous matter\r\nadheres to, and saturates the short wool--it being but a month and a\r\nhalf, or two months, after shearing--and maggots are either carried\r\nthere by the foot, or they are soon generated there. A black crust is\r\nspeedily formed round the spot, which is the decomposition of the\r\nsurrounding structures; and innumerable maggots are at work below,\r\nburrowing into the integuments and muscles, and eating up the wretched\r\nanimal alive. The black, festering mass rapidly spreads, and the poor\r\nsufferer perishes, apparently in tortures the most excruciating.\r\n\r\nSometimes but one forefoot is attacked, and subsequently one or both\r\nhind ones. There is no uniformity in this particular; and it is a\r\nsingular fact that, when two or even three of the feet are dreadfully\r\ndiseased, the fourth may be entirely sound. So, also, one foot may be\r\ncured, while every other one is laboring under the malady. The highly\r\noffensive odor of the ulcerated feet is so peculiar that it is strictly\r\ncharacteristic of the disease, and would reveal its character, to one\r\nfamiliar with it, in the darkest night.\r\n\r\nHoof-ail is probably propagated in this country exclusively by\r\ninoculation--the contact of the matter of a diseased foot with the\r\ninteguments lining the bifurcation of a healthy foot. That it is\r\npropagated in some of the ways classed under the ordinary designation of\r\n_contagion_, is certain. That it may be propagated by inoculation, has\r\nbeen established by experiment. The matter of diseased feet has been\r\nplaced on the skin lining the cleft of a healthy foot under a variety of\r\ncircumstances--sometimes when that skin is in its ordinary and natural\r\nstate, sometimes after a very slight scorification, sometimes when\r\nmacerated by moisture; and under each of these circumstances the\r\ndisease has been communicated. The same inference may be drawn, also,\r\nfrom the manner in which the disease attacks flocks. The whole, or\r\nany considerable number, though sometimes rapidly, are never\r\n_simultaneously_ attacked, as would be expected, among animals so\r\ngregarious, if the disease could be transmitted by simple contact,\r\ninhaling the breath, or other effluvium.\r\n\r\nThe matter of diseased feet is left on grass, straw, and other\r\nsubstances, and thus is brought in contact with the inner surfaces of\r\nhealthy feet. Sheep, therefore, contract the disease from being driven\r\nover the pastures, yarded on the straw, etc., where diseased sheep have\r\nbeen, perhaps even days, before. The matter would probably continue to\r\ninoculate, until dried up by the air and heat, or washed away by the\r\nrains. The stiff, upright stems of closely mown grass, as on meadows,\r\nare almost as well calculated to receive the matter of diseased feet,\r\nand deposit it in the clefts of healthy ones, as any means which could\r\nbe artificially devised. It is not entirely safe to drive healthy sheep\r\nover roads, and especially into washing-yards, or sheep houses, where\r\ndiseased sheep have been, until rain has fallen, or sufficient time has\r\nelapsed for the matter to dry up. On the moist bottom of a washing-yard,\r\nand particularly in houses or sheds, kept from sun and wind and rain,\r\nthis matter might be preserved for some time in a condition to\r\ninoculate.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease has been well kept under during the first season of its\r\nattack, but not entirely eradicated, it will almost or entirely\r\ndisappear as cold weather approaches, and it does not manifest itself\r\nuntil the warm weather of the succeeding summer. It then assumes a\r\nmitigated form; the sheep are not rapidly and simultaneously attacked;\r\nthere seems to be less inflammatory action constitutionally, and in the\r\ndiseased parts; the course of the disease is less malignant and more\r\ntardy, and it more readily yields to treatment. If well kept under the\r\nsecond summer, it is still milder the third. A sheep will occasionally\r\nbe seen to limp; but its condition will scarcely be affected, and\r\ndangerous symptoms will rarely supervene. One or two applications made\r\nduring the summer, in a manner presently to be described, will suffice\r\nto keep the disease under. At this point, a little vigor in the\r\ntreatment will rapidly extinguish the disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ The preparation of the foot, where any separate individual\r\ntreatment is resolved upon, is always necessary, at least in bad cases.\r\nSheep should be yarded for the operation immediately after a rain, if\r\npracticable, as the hoofs can then be readily cut. In a dry time, and\r\nafter a night which left no dew upon the grass, their hoofs are almost\r\nas tough as horn. They must be driven through no mud, or soft dung, on\r\ntheir way to the yard, which would double the labor of cleaning their\r\nfeet. The yard should be small, so that they can be easily caught, and\r\nit must be kept well littered down, to prevent their filling their feet\r\nwith their own excrement. If the straw is wetted, their hoofs will not,\r\nof course, dry and harden as rapidly as in dry straw. If the yard could\r\nbe built over a shallow, gravelly-bottomed brook, it would be an\r\nadmirable arrangement; for this purpose, a portion of any little brook\r\nmight be prepared, by planking the bottom, and widening it, if\r\ndesirable. By such means the hoofs would be kept so soft that the\r\ngreatest and most unpleasant part of the labor, as ordinarily performed,\r\nwould be in a great measure saved, and they would be kept free from that\r\ndung which, by any other arrangement, will, more or less, get into their\r\nclefts.\r\n\r\nThe principal operator seats himself on a chair, having within his reach\r\na couple of good knives, a whetstone, the powerful toe-nippers already\r\ndescribed, a bucket of water with a couple of linen rags in it, together\r\nwith such medicines as may be deemed necessary. The assistant catches a\r\nsheep and lays it partly on its back and rump, between the legs of the\r\nforeman, the head coming up about to his middle. The assistant then\r\nkneels on some straw, or seats himself on a low stool at the hinder\r\nextremity of the sheep. If the hoofs are long, and especially if they\r\nare dry and tough, the assistant presents each foot to the operator who\r\nshortens the hoof with the toe-nippers. If there is any filth between\r\nthe toes, each man takes his rag from the bucket of water, and draws it\r\nbetween the toes, and rinses it, until the filth is removed. Each then\r\ntakes a knife, and the process of paring away the horn commences, _upon\r\nthe effectual performance of which_ all else depends. A glance at the\r\nfoot will show whether it is the seat of the diseased action. The least\r\nexperience cannot fail in properly settling this question. An\r\nexperienced finger, even, placed upon the back of the pastern close\r\nabove the heel, will at once detect the local inflammation, in the dark,\r\n_by its heat_.\r\n\r\nIf the disease is in the first stage--that is, if there are merely\r\nerosion and ulceration of the cuticle and flesh in the cleft _above_ the\r\nwalls of the hoof--no paring is necessary. But if ulceration has\r\nestablished itself between the hoof and the fleshy sole, _the ulcerated\r\nparts_, however extensive, _must be entirely stripped of their horny\r\ncovering_, no matter what amount of time and care it may require. It is\r\nbetter not to wound the sole so as to cause it to bleed freely, as the\r\nrunning blood will wash off the subsequent application; but no fear of\r\nwounding the sole must prevent a full compliance with the rule laid down\r\nabove. At the worst, the blood will stop flowing after a little while,\r\nduring which time no application needs to be made to the foot.\r\n\r\nIf the foot is in the third stage--a mass of rottenness, and filled with\r\nmaggots--pour, in the first place, a little spirits of turpentine--a\r\nbottle of which, with a quill through the cork, should be always\r\nready--on the maggots, and most of them will immediately decamp, and the\r\nothers can be removed with a probe or small stick. Then _remove every\r\nparticle of loose horn_, though it should take the entire hoof, as it\r\ngenerally will in such cases. The foot should next be cleansed with a\r\nsolution of chloride of lime, in the proportion of one pound of chloride\r\nto one gallon of water. If this is not at hand, plunging the foot\r\nrepeatedly in hot water, just short of scalding hot, will answer every\r\npurpose. The great object is _to clean the foot thoroughly_. If there is\r\nany considerable \"proud flesh,\" it should be removed with a pair of\r\nscissors, or by the actual cautery--hot iron.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most popular remedies: Take two ounces of\r\nblue vitriol and two ounces of verdigris, to a junk-bottle of wine; or\r\nspirits of turpentine, tar, and verdigris in equal parts; or three\r\nquarts of alcohol, one pint of spirits of turpentine, one pint of strong\r\nvinegar, one pound of blue vitriol, one pound of copperas, one and a\r\nhalf pounds of verdigris, one pound of alum, and one pound of saltpetre,\r\npounded fine; mix in a close bottle, shake every day, and let it stand\r\nsix or eight days before using; also mix two pounds of honey and two\r\nquarts of tar, which must be applied after the preceding compound. Or\r\napply diluted aquafortis--nitric acid--with a feather to the ulcerated\r\nsurface; or diluted oil of vitriol--sulphuric acid--in the same way; or\r\nthe same of muriatic acid; or dip the foot in tar nearly at the boiling\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn the first and second stages of the disease, before the ulcers have\r\nformed sinuses into the sole, and wholly or partly destroyed its\r\nstructure, the best application is a saturated solution of blue\r\nvitriol--sulphate of copper. In the third stage, when the foot is a\r\nfestering mass of corruption, after it has been cleansed as already\r\ndirected, it requires some strong caustic to remove the unhealthy\r\ngranulations--the dead muscular structures--and to restore healthy\r\naction. Lunar caustic, which is preferable to any other application, is\r\ntoo expensive; chloride of antimony is excellent, but frequently\r\nunattainable in the country drug-stores; and muriatic acid, or even\r\nnitric or sulphuric acids, may be used instead. The diseased surface is\r\ntouched with the caustic, applied with a swab, formed by fastening a\r\nlittle tow on the end of a stick, until the objects above pointed out\r\nare attained. The foot is then treated with the solution of blue\r\nvitriol, and subsequently coated over with tar which has been boiled,\r\nand is properly cooled, for the purpose of protecting the raw wound from\r\ndirt, flies, etc. Sheep in this stage of the disease should certainly be\r\nseparated from the main flock, and looked to as often as once in three\r\ndays. With this degree of attention, their cure will be rapid, and the\r\nobliterated structures of the foot will be restored with astonishing\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe common method of using the solution of blue vitriol is to pour it\r\nfrom a bottle with a quill in the cork, into the foot, when the animal\r\nlies on its back between the operators, as already described. In this\r\nway a few cents' worth of vitriol will answer for a large number of\r\nsheep. The method is, however, imperfect; since, without extraordinary\r\ncare, there will almost always be some slight ulcerations not uncovered\r\nby the knife, which the solution will not reach, the passages to them\r\nbeing devious, and perhaps nearly or quite closed. The disease will thus\r\nbe only temporarily suppressed, not cured.\r\n\r\nA flock of sheep which were in the second season of the disease, had\r\nbeen but little looked to during the summer, and as cold weather set in,\r\nmany of them became considerably lame, and some of them quite so. Their\r\nfeet were thoroughly pared; and into a large washing-tub, in which two\r\nsheep could conveniently stand, a saturated solution of blue vitriol and\r\nwater, _as hot as could be endured by the hand even for a moment_, was\r\npoured. The liquid was about four inches deep on the bottom of the tub,\r\nand was kept at that depth by frequent additions of hot solution. As\r\nsoon as a sheep's feet were pared, it was placed in the tub, and held\r\nthere by the neck. A second one was then prepared, and placed beside it;\r\nwhen the third was ready, the first was taken out; and so on. Two sheep\r\nwere thus constantly in the tub, each remaining some five minutes. The\r\ncure was perfect; there was not a lame sheep in the flock during the\r\nwinter or the next summer. The hot liquid penetrated to every cavity of\r\nthe foot; and doubtless had a far more decisive effect, even on the\r\nuncovered ulcers, than would have been produced by merely wetting them.\r\nThe expense attending the operation was about _four cents_ per sheep.\r\nThree such applications, at intervals of a week, would effectually cure\r\nthe disease, since every new case would thus be arrested and cured\r\nbefore it would have time to inoculate others. It would, undoubtedly,\r\naccomplish this at any time of year, and even during the first and most\r\nmalignant prevalence of the contagion, _provided the paring was\r\nsufficiently thorough_. The second and third parings would be a mere\r\ntrifle; and the liquid left at the first and second applications could\r\nagain be used. Thus sheep could be cured at about twelve cents per head,\r\nwhich is much cheaper, in the long run, than any ordinary temporizing\r\nmethod, where the cost of a few pounds of blue vitriol is counted, but\r\nnot the time consumed; and the disease is thus kept lingering in the\r\nflock for years.\r\n\r\nSome Northern farmers drive their sheep over dusty roads as a remedy for\r\nthis disease; and in cases of ordinary virulence, especially where the\r\ndisease is chronic, it seems to dry up the ulcers, and keep the malady\r\nunder. Sheep are also sometimes cured by keeping them on a dry surface,\r\nand driving them over a barn-floor daily, which is well covered with\r\nquick-lime. It may sometimes, and under peculiar circumstances, be cured\r\nby dryness, and repeated washing with soap-suds.\r\n\r\nMany farmers select rainy weather as the time for doctoring their sheep.\r\nTheir feet are then soft, and it is therefore on all accounts good\r\neconomy, when the feet are to be pared, and each separately treated,\r\n_provided_ they can be kept in sheep-houses, or under shelters of any\r\nkind, until the rain is over, and the grass again dry. If immediately\r\nlet out in wet grass of any length, the vitriol or other application is\r\nmeasurably washed away. This is avoided by many, by dipping the feet in\r\nmore tar--an admirable plan under such circumstances.\r\n\r\nA flock of sheep which have been cured of the hoof-ail, is considered\r\nmore valuable than one which has never had it. They are far less liable\r\nto contract the disease from any casual exposure; and its ravages are\r\nfar less violent and general among them.\r\n\r\nThis ailment should not be confounded with a temporary soreness, or\r\ninflammation of the hoof, occasioned by the irritation from the long,\r\nrough grasses which abound in low situations, which is removed with the\r\ncause; or, if it continues, white paint or tar may be applied, after a\r\nthorough washing.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOOVE.\r\n\r\nThis is not common, to any dangerous degree, among sheep; but, if turned\r\nupon clover when their stomachs are empty, it will sometimes ensue.\r\n\r\nHoove is a distension of the paunch by gas extricated from the\r\nfermentation of its vegetable contents, and evolved more rapidly, or in\r\nlarger quantities, than can be neutralized by the natural alkaline\r\nsecretions of the stomach. When the distention is great, the blood is\r\nprevented from circulating in the vessels of the rumen, and is\r\ndetermined to the head. The diaphragm is mechanically obstructed from\r\nmaking its ordinary contractions, and respiration, therefore, becomes\r\ndifficult and imperfect. Death, in such cases, soon supervenes.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ In ordinary cases, gentle but prolonged driving will effect\r\na cure. When the animal appears swelled almost to bursting, and is\r\ndisinclined to move, it is better to open the paunch at once. At the\r\nmost protruberant point of the swelling, on the left side, a little\r\nbelow the hip bone, plunge a trochar or knife, sharp at the point and\r\ndull on the edge, into the stomach. The gas will rapidly escape,\r\ncarrying with it some of the liquid and solid contents of the stomach.\r\nIf no measures are taken to prevent it, the peristaltic motion, as well\r\nas the collapse of the stomach, will soon cause the orifices through the\r\nabdomen and paunch not to coincide, and thus portions of the contents of\r\nthe former will escape into the cavity of the latter.\r\n\r\nHowever perfect the cure of hoove, these substances in the belly will\r\nultimately produce fatal irritation. To prevent this, a canula, or\r\nlittle tube, should be inserted through both orifices as soon as the\r\npuncture is made. Where the case is not imminent, alkalies have\r\nsometimes been successfully administered, which combine with the\r\ncarbonic acid gas, and thus at once reduce its volume. A flexible\r\nprobang, or in default of it, a rattan, or grape-vine, with a knot on\r\nthe end, may be gently forced down the gullet, and the gas thus\r\npermitted to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDATID ON THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of this disease, known as turnsick, sturdy, staggers, water\r\nin the head, etc., are a dull, moping appearance, the sheep separating\r\nfrom the flock, a wandering and blue appearance of the eye, and\r\nsometimes partial or total blindness; the sheep appears unsteady in its\r\nwalk, will sometimes stop suddenly and fall down, at others gallop\r\nacross the field, and, after the disease has existed for some time, will\r\nalmost constantly move round in a circle--there seems, indeed, to be an\r\naberration of the intellect of the animal. These symptoms, though rarely\r\nall present in the same subject, are yet sufficiently marked to prevent\r\nany mistake as to the nature of the disease.\r\n\r\nOn examining the brain of sheep thus affected, what appears to be a\r\nwatery bladder, called a hydatid, is found, which may be either small or\r\nof the size of a hen's egg. This hydatid, one of the class of entozooens,\r\nhas been termed by naturalists the _hydatis polycephalus cerebralis_, or\r\nmany-headed hydatid of the brain; these heads being irregularly\r\ndistributed on the surface of the bladder, and on the front part of each\r\nhead there is a mouth surrounded by minute sharp hooks within a ring of\r\nsucking disks. These disks serve as the means of attachment, by forming\r\na vacuum, and bring the mouth in contact with the surface, and thus, by\r\nthe aid of the hooks, the parasite is nourished. The coats of the\r\nhydatid are disposed in several layers, one of which appears to possess\r\na muscular power. These facts are developed by the microscope, which\r\nalso discloses numerous little bodies adhering to the internal membrane.\r\nThe fluid in the bladder is usually clear but occasionally turbid, and\r\nthen it has been found to contain a number of minute worms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ This is deemed an almost incurable disorder. Where the\r\nhydatid is not imbedded in the brain, its constant pressure, singularly\r\nenough, causes a portion of the cranium to be absorbed, and finally the\r\npart immediately over the hydatid becomes thin and soft enough to yield\r\nunder the pressure of the finger.\r\n\r\nWhen such a spot is discovered, the English veterinarians usually\r\ndissect back the muscular integuments, remove a portion of the bone,\r\ncarefully divide the investing membranes of the brain, and then, if\r\npossible, remove the hydatid whole; or, failing to do this, remove its\r\nfluid contents. The membranes and integuments are then restored to their\r\nposition, and an adhesive plaster placed over the whole. The French\r\nveterinarians usually simply puncture the cranium and the cyst with a\r\ntrochar, and laying the sheep on its back, allow the fluid to run out\r\nthrough the orifice thus made. A common awl would answer every purpose\r\nfor such a puncture; and the puncture is the preferable method for the\r\nunskilled practitioner. An instance is, indeed, recorded of a cure\r\nhaving been effected, where the animal had been given up, by boring with\r\na gimlet into the soft place on the head, when the water rushed out,\r\nand the sheep immediately followed the others to the pasture.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the hazard and cruelty attending the operation, under the\r\nmost favorable circumstances, are considered, as well as the conceded\r\nliability of a return of the malady--the growth of new hydatids--it is\r\nevident that in this country, it would not be worth while, except in the\r\ncase of uncommonly valuable sheep, to adopt any other remedy than\r\ndepriving the miserable animal of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION OF THE GULLET.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BARRACK FOR STORING SHEEP-FODDER.]\r\n\r\nAfter pouring a little oil in the throat, the obstructing substance\r\nwhich occasions the \"choking,\" can frequently be removed up or down by\r\nexternal manipulation. If not, it may usually be forced down with the\r\nflexible probang, described in \"Cattle and their Diseases,\" or a\r\nflexible rod, the head of which is guarded by a knot, or a little bag of\r\nflax-seed. The latter having been dipped in hot water for a minute or\r\ntwo, is partly converted into mucilage, which constantly exudes through\r\nthe cloth, and protects the [oe]sophagus, or gullet, from laceration.\r\nBut little force must be used, and the whole operation conducted with\r\nthe utmost care and gentleness; or the [oe]sophagus will be so far\r\nlacerated as to produce death, although the obstruction is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPHTHALMIA.\r\n\r\nOphthalmia, or inflammation of the eyes, is not uncommon in this\r\ncountry; but it is little noticed, as, in most cases, it disappears in a\r\nfew days, or, at worst, is only followed by cataract, which, being\r\nusually confined to one eye, does not appreciably effect the value of\r\nthe animal, and therefore has no influence on its market price.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Some recommend blowing pulverized red chalk in the inflamed\r\neye; others squirt into it tobacco juice. As a matter of humanity, blood\r\nmay be drawn from under the eye, and the eye bathed in tepid water, and\r\noccasionally with a weak solution of the sulphate of zinc combined with\r\ntincture of opium. These latter applications diminish the pain, and\r\nhasten the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALSY.\r\n\r\nParalysis, or palsy, is a diminution or entire loss of the powers of\r\nmotion in some parts of the body. In the winter, poor lambs, or poor\r\npregnant ewes, or poor feeble ewes immediately after yeaning in the\r\nspring, occasionally lose the power of walking or standing rather too\r\nsuddenly to have it referable to increasing debility. The animal seems\r\nto have lost all strength in its loins, and the hind-quarters are\r\npowerless; it makes ineffectual attempts to rise, and cannot stand if\r\nplaced upon its feet.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Warmth, gentle stimulants, and good nursing may raise the\r\npatient; but, in the vast majority of cases, it is more economical and\r\nequally humane, to deprive it of life at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nPELT-ROT.\r\n\r\nThis is often mistaken for the scab, but it is, in fact, a different and\r\nless dangerous disease. The wool falls off, and leaves the sheep nearly\r\nnaked; but it is attended with no soreness, though a reddish crust will\r\ncover the skin, from the wool which has dropped. It generally arises\r\nfrom hard keeping and much exposure to cold and wet; and, in fact, the\r\nanimal often dies in severe weather from the cold it suffers on account\r\nof the loss of its coat.\r\n\r\nThe _remedy_ is full feeding, a warm stall, and anointing the hard part\r\nof the skin with tar, oil, and butter. Some, however, do nothing for it,\r\nscarcely considering it a disease. Such say that if the condition of a\r\npoor sheep is raised as suddenly as practicable, by generous keep in the\r\nwinter, the wool is very apt to drop off; and, if yet cold, the sheep\r\nwill require warm shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nPneumonia--or inflammation of the lungs--is not a common disease in the\r\nNorthern States; but undoubted cases of it sometimes occur, after sheep\r\nhave been exposed to sudden cold, particularly when recently shorn. The\r\nadhesions occasionally witnessed between the lungs and pleura of\r\nslaughtered sheep, betray the former existence of this disease in the\r\nanimal--though, in many instances, it was so slight as to be mistaken,\r\nat the time, for a hard cold.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The animal is dull, ceases to ruminate, neglects its food,\r\ndrinks frequently and largely, and its breathing is rapid and laborious;\r\nthe eye is clouded; the nose discharges a tenacious, fetid matter; the\r\nteeth are ground frequently, so that the sound is audible at some\r\ndistance; the pulse is at first hard and rapid, sometimes intermits, but\r\nbefore death it becomes weak. During the height of the fever, the flanks\r\nheave violently; there is a hard, painful cough during the first stages,\r\nwhich becomes weaker, and seems to be accompanied with more pain as\r\ndeath approaches.\r\n\r\nAfter death, the lungs are found more or less hepatized--that is,\r\npermanently condensed and engorged with blood, so that their structure\r\nresembles that of the _hepar_, or liver--and they have so far lost their\r\nintegrity that they are torn asunder by the slightest force. It may here\r\nbe remarked that when sheep die from any cause, _with their blood in\r\nthem_, the lungs have a dark, hepatized appearance. Whether they are\r\nactually hepatized or not, can readily be decided by compressing the\r\nwindpipe, so that air cannot escape through it, and then between such\r\ncompression and the body of the lungs, in a closely fitting orifice,\r\ninserting a goose-quill, or other tube, and continuing to blow until the\r\nlungs are inflated as far as they can be. As they inflate, they will\r\nbecome of a lighter color, and plainly manifest their cellular\r\nstructure. If any portions of them cannot be inflated, and retain their\r\ndark, liver-like consistence, and color, they exhibit hepatization--the\r\nresult of high inflammatory action--and a state utterly incompatible, in\r\nthe living animal, with the discharge of the natural functions of the\r\nviscus.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ In the first, or inflammatory stages, bleeding and\r\naperients are clearly called for. Some recommend early and copious\r\nbleeding, repeated, if necessary, in a few hours; this followed by\r\naperient medicines, such as two ounces of Epsom salts, which may be\r\nrepeated in smaller doses, if the bowels are not sufficiently relaxed.\r\nThe following sedative may also be given with gruel, twice a day:\r\nnitrate of potash, one drachm; powdered digitalis, one scruple; and\r\ntartarized antimony, one scruple.\r\n\r\nWhile depletion may be of inestimable value during the continuance--the\r\nshort continuance--of the febrile state, yet excitation like this will\r\nsoon be followed by corresponding exhaustion, when the bleeding and\r\npurging would be murderous expedients; and gentian, ginger, and the\r\nspirits of nitrous ether will afford the only hope of cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISON.\r\n\r\nSheep will often, in the winter or spring, eat greedily of the low\r\nlaurel. The animal appears afterward to be dull and stupid, swells a\r\nlittle, and is constantly gulping up a feverish fluid, which it swallows\r\nagain; a part of it will trickle out of its mouth, and discolor its\r\nlips. The plant probably brings on a fermentation in the stomach, and\r\nnature endeavors to throw off the poisonous herb by retching or\r\nvomiting.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ In the early stages, if the greenish fluid be allowed to\r\nescape from the stomach, the animal generally recovers. To effect this,\r\ngag the sheep, which may be done in this manner: Take a stick of the\r\nsize of the wrist, six inches long--place it in the animal's mouth--tie\r\na string to one end of it, pass it over the head and down to the other\r\nend, and there make it fast. The fluid will then run from the mouth as\r\nfast as thrown up from the stomach. In addition to this, give roasted\r\nonions and sweetened milk freely. A better plan, however, is to force a\r\ngill of melted lard down the throat; or, boil for an hour the twigs of\r\nthe white ash, and give one-half to one gill of the strong liquor\r\nimmediately; to be repeated, if not successful. Drenchers of milk and\r\ncastor-oil are also recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nROT.\r\n\r\nThis disease, which sometimes causes the death of a million of sheep, in\r\nEngland, in a single year, is comparatively unknown in this country. It\r\nprevails somewhat in the Western States, from allowing sheep to pasture\r\non land that is overflowed with water. Even a crop of green oats, early\r\nin the fall, before a frost comes; has been known to rot young sheep.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._ The first are by no means strongly marked; there is no loss\r\nof condition, but rather the contrary, to all appearance. A paleness and\r\nwant of liveliness of the membranes, generally, may be considered as the\r\nfirst symptoms, to which may be added a yellowness of the caruncle at\r\nthe corner of the eye. When in warm, sultry, or rainy weather, sheep\r\nthat are grazing on low and moist lands, feed rapidly, and some of them\r\ndie suddenly, there is ground for fearing that they have contracted the\r\nrot. This suspicion will be farther increased if, a few days afterward,\r\nthe sheep begin to shrink and grow flaccid about the loins. By pressure\r\nabout the hips at this time, a crackling is perceptible now or soon\r\nafterward, the countenance looks pale, and upon parting the fleece, the\r\nskin is found to have changed its vermilion tint for a pale red, and the\r\nwool is easily separated from the felt; and as the disorder advances,\r\nthe skin becomes dappled with yellow or black spots. To these symptoms\r\nsucceed increased dullness, loss of condition, and greater paleness of\r\nthe mucous membranes, the eye-lids becoming almost white, and afterward\r\nyellow. This yellowness extends to other parts of the body, and a watery\r\nfluid appears under the skin, the latter becoming loose and flabby, and\r\nthe wool coming off readily. The symptoms of dropsy often extend over\r\nthe body, and sometimes the sheep becomes _chockered_, as it is termed;\r\na large swelling forms under the jaw, which, from the appearance of the\r\nfluid which it contains, is sometimes called the _watery poke_. The\r\nduration of the disease is uncertain; the animal occasionally dies\r\nshortly after becoming affected, but more frequently it extends to from\r\nthree to six months, the sheep gradually losing flesh and pining away,\r\nparticularly if, as is frequently the case, an obstinate purging\r\nsupervenes.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem._ The whole cellular tissue is found to be infiltrated, and\r\na yellow serous fluid everywhere follows the knife. The muscles are soft\r\nand flabby, having the appearance of being macerated. The kidneys are\r\npale, flaccid, and infiltrated. The mesenteric glands are enlarged, and\r\nengorged with yellow serous fluid. The belly is frequently filled with\r\nwater, or purulent matter; the peritoneum is everywhere thickened, and\r\nthe bowels adhere together by means of an unnatural growth. The heart is\r\nenlarged and softened, and the lungs are filled with tubercles. The\r\nprincipal alterations of structure are in the liver, which is pale,\r\nlivid, and broken down with the slightest pressure; and on being boiled,\r\nit will almost dissolve away. When the liver is not pale, it is often\r\ncuriously spotted; in some cases it is speckled, like the back of a\r\ntoad; some parts of it, however, are hard and schirrous; others are\r\nulcerated, and the biliary ducts are filled with flukes. The malady is,\r\nunquestionably, inflammation of the liver. This fluke is from\r\nthree-quarters of an inch to an inch and a quarter in length, and from\r\none-third to one-half an inch in its greatest breadth. These fluke-worms\r\nundoubtedly aggravate the disease, and perpetuate a state of\r\nirritability and disorganization, which must necessarily undermine the\r\nstrength of any animal.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ This must, to a considerable extent, be very\r\nunsatisfactory. After the use of dry food and dry bedding, one of the\r\nbest _preventives_ is the abundant use of pure salt. In violent attacks,\r\ntake eight, ten, or twelve ounces of blood, according to the\r\ncircumstances of the case; to this, let a dose of physic succeed--two or\r\nthree ounces of Epsom salts; and to these means add a change of diet,\r\ngood hay in the field, and hay, straw, or chaff in the yard. After the\r\noperation of the physic--an additional dose having been administered,\r\noftentimes, in order to quicken the action of the first--two or three\r\ngrains of calomel may be given daily, mixed with half the quantity of\r\nopium, in order to secure its beneficial, and ward off its injurious\r\neffects on the ruminant. To this should be added common salt, which acts\r\nas a purgative and a tonic. A mild tonic, as well as an aperient, is\r\nplainly indicated soon after the commencement of rot. The doses should\r\nbe from two to three drachms, repeated morning and night. When the\r\ninflammatory stage is clearly passed, stronger tonics may be added to\r\nthe salt, and there are none superior to the gentian and ginger roots;\r\nfrom one to two drachms of each, finely pounded, may be added to each\r\ndose of the salt. The sheep having a little recovered from the disease,\r\nshould still continue on the best and driest pasture on the farm, and\r\nshould always have salt within their reach. The rot is not infectious.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCAB.\r\n\r\nThis is a cutaneous disease, analogous to the mange in horses and the\r\nitch in man, and is caused and propagated by a minute insect, the\r\n_acarus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BROAD-TAILED SHEEP.]\r\n\r\nIf one or more female _acari_ are placed on the wool of a sound sheep,\r\nthey quickly travel to the root of it, and bury themselves in the skin,\r\nthe place at which they penetrate being scarcely visible, or only\r\ndistinguishable by a minute red point. On the tenth or twelfth day, a\r\nlittle swelling may be detected with the finger, and the skin changes\r\nits color, and has a greenish blue tint. The pustule is now rapidly\r\nformed, and about the sixteenth day breaks, when the mothers again\r\nappear, with their little ones attached to their feet, and covered by a\r\nportion of the shell of the egg from which they have just escaped. These\r\nlittle ones immediately set to work, penetrate the neighboring skin,\r\nbury themselves beneath it, find their proper nourishment, and grow and\r\npropagate, until the poor creature has myriads of them preying upon him.\r\nIt is not wonderful that, under such circumstances, he should speedily\r\nsink. The male _acari_, when placed on the sound skin of a sheep, will\r\nlikewise burrow their way and disappear for a while, the pustule rising\r\nin due time; but the itching and the scab soon disappear without the\r\nemployment of any remedy. The female brings forth from eight to fifteen\r\nyoung at a time.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, this disease is comparatively little known, and\r\nnever originates spontaneously. The fact, that short-woolled sheep--like\r\nthe Merino--are much less subject to its attacks, is probably one reason\r\nfor this slight comparative prevalence. The disease spreads from\r\nindividual to individual, and from flock to flock, not only by means of\r\ndirect contact, but by the _acari_ left on posts, stones, and other\r\nsubstances against which diseased sheep have rubbed themselves. Healthy\r\nsheep are, therefore, liable to contract the malady, if turned on\r\npastures previously occupied by scabby sheep, although some considerable\r\ntime may have elapsed since the departure of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe sheep laboring under the scab is exceedingly restless. It rubs\r\nitself with violence against trees, stones, fences, etc.; scratches\r\nitself with its feet, bites its sores, and tears off its wool with its\r\nteeth; as the pustules are broken, their matter escapes, and forms\r\nscabs, causing red, inflamed sores, which constantly extend, increasing\r\nthe misery of the tortured animal; if unrelieved, he pines away, and\r\nsoon perishes.\r\n\r\nThe _post-mortem_ appearances are very uncertain and inconclusive. There\r\nis generally chronic inflammation of the intestines, with the presence\r\nof a great number of worms. The liver is occasionally schirrous, and the\r\nspleen enlarged; and there are frequently serous effusions in the belly,\r\nand sometimes in the chest. There has been evident sympathy between the\r\ndigestive and the cutaneous systems.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ First, separate the sheep; then cut off the wool as far as\r\nthe skin feels hard to the finger; the scab is then washed with\r\nsoap-suds, and rubbed hard With a shoe-brush, so that it may be cleansed\r\nand broken. For this use take a decoction of tobacco, to which add\r\none-third, by measure, of the lye of wood-ashes, as much hog's lard as\r\nwill be dissolved by the lye, a small quantity of tar from a tar-bucket,\r\nwhich contains grease, and about one-eighth of the whole, by measure, of\r\nspirits of turpentine. This liquor is rubbed upon the part infected, and\r\nspread to a little distance around it, in three washings, with an\r\ninterval of three days each. This will invariably effect a cure, when\r\nthe disorder is only partial.\r\n\r\nOr, the following: Dip the sheep in an infusion of arsenic, in the\r\nproportion of half a pound of arsenic to twelve gallons of water. The\r\nsheep should be previously washed in soap and water. The infusion must\r\nnot be permitted to enter the mouth or nostrils.\r\n\r\nOr, take common mercurial ointment; for bad cases, rub it down with\r\nthree times its weight of lard--for ordinary cases, five times its\r\nweight. Rub a little of this ointment into the head of the sheep. Part\r\nthe wool so as to expose the skin in a line from the head to the tail,\r\nand then apply a little of the ointment with the finger the whole way.\r\nMake a similar furrow and application on each side, four inches from the\r\nfirst; and so on, over the whole body. The quantity of ointment after\r\ncomposition with the lard, should not exceed two ounces; and, generally,\r\nless will suffice. A lamb requires but one-third as much as a grown\r\nsheep. This will generally cure; but, if the animal should continue to\r\nrub itself, a lighter application of the same should be made in ten\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nOr, take two pounds of lard or palm oil; half a pound of oil of tar; and\r\none pound of sulphur; gradually mix the last two, then rub down the\r\ncompound with the first. Apply as before. Or, take of corrosive\r\nsublimate, one half a pound; white hellabore, powdered, three-fourths of\r\na pound; whale or other oil, six gallons; rosin, two pounds; and tallow,\r\ntwo pounds. The first two to be mixed with a little of the oil, and the\r\nrest being melted together, the whole to be gradually mixed. This is a\r\npowerful preparation, and must not be applied too freely.\r\n\r\nAn erysipelatous scab, or erysipelas, attended with considerable\r\nitching, sometimes troubles sheep. This is a febrile disease, and is\r\ntreated with a cooling purgative, bleeding, and oil or lard applied to\r\nthe sores.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALL-POX.\r\n\r\nThe author acknowledges himself indebted for what follows under this\r\nhead to R. McClure, V. S., of Philadelphia, author of a Prize Essay on\r\nDiseases of Sheep, read before the U. S. Agricultural Society, in 1860,\r\nfor which a medal and diploma were awarded.\r\n\r\nAlthough the small-pox in domestic animals has, fortunately, been as yet\r\nconfined to the European Continent--where it has been chiefly limited to\r\nEngland--no good reason can ever be assigned why it should not at some\r\nfuture time make its appearance among us, especially when we remember\r\nhow long a period elapsed, during which we escaped the cattle plague,\r\nalthough the Continent had long been suffering from it.\r\n\r\nThe small-pox in sheep--_variola overia_--is, at times, epizooetic in the\r\nflocks of France and Italy, but was unknown in England until 1847, when\r\nit was communicated to a flock at Datchett and another at Pinnier by\r\nsome Merinos from Spain. It soon found its way into Hampshire and\r\nNorfolk, but was shortly afterward supposed to be eradicated. In 1862,\r\nhowever, it suddenly reappeared in a severe form among the flocks of\r\nWiltshire; for which reappearance neither any traceable infection nor\r\ncontagion could be assigned. With the present light upon the subject, it\r\nwould seem to be an instance of the origination _anew_ of a malignant\r\ntype of varioloid disease. Such an origin is, in fact, assigned to this\r\ndisease in Africa, it being well established that certain devitalizing\r\natmospheric influences produce skin diseases, and facilitate the\r\nappearance of pustular eruptions.\r\n\r\nThe disease once rooted soon becomes epizooetic, and causes a greater\r\nmortality than any other malady affecting this animal. Out of a flock\r\nnumbering 1720, 920 were attacked in a natural way, of which 50 per\r\ncent. died. Of 800 inoculated cases, but 36 per cent. died.\r\n\r\nNumerous experiments have proved beyond all doubt that this disease in\r\nsheep is both infectious and contagious; its period of incubation varies\r\nfrom seven to fourteen days. The mortality is never less than 25 per\r\ncent., and not unfrequently whole flocks have been swept away, death\r\ntaking place in the early stages of the eruption, or in the stages of\r\nsuppuration and ulceration.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ may be mapped out as follows: The animal is seized with a\r\nshivering fit, succeeded by a dull stupidity, which remains until death\r\nor recovery results; on the second or third day, pimples are seen on the\r\nthighs and arm-pits, accompanied with extreme redness of the eyes,\r\ncomplete loss of appetite, etc., etc. It is needless to enumerate other\r\nsymptoms which exist in common with those of other disorders.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._ At present, but two modes are resorted to, for the purpose\r\nof preventing the spread of the disease, which promise any degree of\r\ncertainty of success. The first is by _inoculation_, which was\r\nrecommended by Professor Simonds, of London. This distinguished\r\npathologist appears to have overlooked the fact that he was thereby only\r\nenlarging the sphere of mischief, by imparting the disease to animals\r\nthat, in all probability, would otherwise have escaped it. By\r\ninoculation, moreover, a form of the disease is given, not of a modified\r\ncharacter, but with all the virulence of the original affection which is\r\nto be arrested, and equally as potent for further destruction of others.\r\nBy such teaching, inoculation and vaccination would be made one and the\r\nsame thing, notwithstanding their dissimilarity. Even vaccination will\r\nnot protect the animal, as has been already shown by the experiments of\r\nHurbrel D'Arboval.\r\n\r\nThe second and best plan of prevention is _isolation and destruction_,\r\nas recommended by Professor Gamgee, of the Edinburgh Veterinary College.\r\nThis proved a great protection to the sheep-farmers of Wiltshire, in\r\n1862. In all epizooetic diseases, individual cases occur, which, when\r\npointed out and recognized as soon as the fever sets in and the early\r\neruptions appear, should be slaughtered at once and buried, and the rest\r\nof the flock isolated. By this means the disease has been confined to\r\nbut two or three in a large flock.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ In treating this disease, resort has of late been had to a\r\nplant, known as _Sarracenia purpura_--Indian cup, or pitcher\r\nplant--used for this purpose by the Micmacs, a tribe of Indians in\r\nBritish North America. This plant is indigenous, perennial, and is found\r\nfrom the coast of Labrador to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, growing\r\nin great abundance on wet, marshy ground. The use of this plant is\r\nbecoming quite general, and good results have almost uniformly attended\r\nit.\r\n\r\nTake from one to two ounces of the dried root, and slice in thin pieces;\r\nplace in an earthen pot; add a quart of cold water, and allow the liquid\r\nto simmer gently over a steady fire for two or three hours, so as to\r\nlose one-fourth of the quantity. Give of this decoction three\r\nwine-glassfuls at once, and the same quantity from four to six hours\r\nafterwards, when a cure will generally be affected. Weaker and smaller\r\ndoses are certain preventives of the disease. The public are indebted to\r\nDr. Morris, physician to the Halifax (Nova Scotia) Dispensary, for the\r\nmanner of preparing this eminently useful article.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE FACE.\r\n\r\nSheep feeding on pastures infested with John's wort, frequently exhibit\r\nan irritation of skin about the nose and face, which causes the hair to\r\ndrop off from the parts. The irritation sometimes extends over the\r\nentire body. If this plant is eaten in too large quantities, it produces\r\nviolent inflammation of the bowels, and is frequently fatal to lambs,\r\nand sometimes to adults.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Rub a little sulphur and lard on the irritated surface. If\r\nthere are symptoms of inflammation of the bowels, this should be put\r\ninto the mouth of the sheep with a flattened stick. Abundance of salt is\r\ndeemed a _preventive_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORE MOUTH.\r\n\r\nThe lips of sheep sometimes become suddenly sore in the winter, and\r\nswell to the thickness of a man's hand. The malady occasionally attacks\r\nwhole flocks, and becomes quite fatal. It is usually attributed to\r\nnoxious weeds cut with the hay.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Daub the lips and mouth plentifully with tar.\r\n\r\n\r\nTICKS.\r\n\r\nThe treatment necessary as a preventive against these insects, and a\r\nremedy for them, has already been indicated under the head of \"FEEDING\r\nAND MANAGEMENT,\" to which the reader is referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SWINE AND THEIR DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND BREEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hog is a cosmopolite, adapting itself to almost every climate;\r\nthough its natural haunts--like those of the hippopotamus, the elephant,\r\nthe rhinoceros, and most of the thick-skinned animals--are in warm\r\ncountries. They are most abundant in China, the East Indies, and the\r\nimmense range of islands extending throughout the whole Southern and\r\nPacific oceans; but they are also numerous throughout Europe, from its\r\nSouthern coast to the Russian dominions within the Arctic.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the records of history extend, this animal appears to\r\nhave been known, and his flesh made use of as food. Nearly fifteen\r\nhundred years before Christ, Moses gave those laws to the Israelites\r\nwhich have given rise to so much discussion; and it is evident that, had\r\nnot pork been the prevailing food of that nation at the time, such\r\nstringent commandments and prohibitions would not have been necessary.\r\nThe various allusions to this kind of meat, which repeatedly occur in\r\nthe writings of the old Greek authors, show the esteem in which it was\r\nheld among that nation; and it appears that the Romans made the art of\r\nbreeding, rearing, and fattening pigs a study. In fact, the hog was very\r\nhighly prized among the early nations of Europe; and some of the\r\nancients even paid it divine honors.\r\n\r\nThe Jews, the Egyptians, and the Mohammedans alone appear to have\r\nabstained from the flesh of swine. The former were expressly denied its\r\nuse by the laws of Moses. \"And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and\r\nbe cloven-footed, yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean unto you.\"\r\nLev. xi. 7. Upon this prohibition, Mohammed, probably, founded his own.\r\nFor the Mosaic prohibition, various reasons have been assigned: the\r\nalleged extreme filthiness of the animal; it being afflicted with a\r\nleprosy; the great indigestibility of its flesh in hot climates; the\r\nintent to make the Jews \"a peculiar people;\" a preventive of gluttony;\r\nand an admonition of abstinence from sensual and disgusting habits.\r\n\r\nAt what period the animal was reclaimed from his wild State, and by what\r\nnation, cannot be stated. From the earliest times, in England, the hog\r\nhas been regarded as a very important animal, and vast herds were tended\r\nby swineherds, who watched over their safety in the woods, and collected\r\nthem under shelter at night. Its flesh was the staple article of\r\nconsumption in every household, and much of the wealth of the rich and\r\nfree portion of the community consisted in these animals. Hence bequests\r\nof swine, with land for their support, were often made; rights and\r\nprivileges connected with their feeding, and the extent of woodland to\r\nbe occupied by a given number, were granted according to established\r\nrules. Long after the end of the Saxon dynasty, the practice of feeding\r\nswine upon the mast and acorns of the forest was continued till the\r\nforests were cut down, and the land laid open for the plough.\r\n\r\nNature designed the hog to fulfil many important functions in a forest\r\ncountry. By his burrowing after roots and the like, he turns up and\r\ndestroys the larvae of innumerable insects, which would otherwise injure\r\nthe trees as well as their fruit. He destroys the slug-snail and adder,\r\nand thus not only rids the forests of these injurious and unpleasant\r\ninhabitants, but also makes them subservient to his own nourishment, and\r\ntherefore to the benefit of mankind. The fruits which he eats are such\r\nas would otherwise rot on the ground and be wasted, or yield nutriment\r\nto vermin; and his diggings for earth-nuts and the like, loosens the\r\nsoil, and benefits the roots of the trees. Hogs in forest land may,\r\ntherefore, be regarded as eminently beneficial; and it is only the abuse\r\nwhich is to be feared.\r\n\r\nThe hog is popularly regarded as a stupid, brutal, rapacious, and filthy\r\nanimal, grovelling and disgusting in all his habits, intractable and\r\nobstinate in temper. The most offensive epithets among men are borrowed\r\nfrom him, or his peculiarities. In their native state, however, swine\r\nseem by no means destitute of natural affections; they are gregarious,\r\nassemble together in defence of each other, herd together for warmth,\r\nand appear to have feelings in common; no mother is more tender to her\r\nyoung than the sow, or more resolute in their defence. Neglected as this\r\nanimal has ever been by authors, recorded instances are not wanting of\r\ntheir sagacity, tractability, and susceptibility of affection. Among the\r\nEuropean peasantry, where the hog is, so to speak, one of the family, he\r\nmay often be seen following his master from place to place, and grunting\r\nhis recognition of his protectors.\r\n\r\nThe hog, in point of actual fact, is also a much more cleanly animal\r\nthan he has the credit of being. He is fond of a good, cleanly bed; and\r\nwhen this is not provided for him, it is oftentimes interesting to note\r\nthe degree of sagacity with which he will forage for himself. It is,\r\nhowever, so much the vogue to believe that he may be kept in any state\r\nof neglect, that the terms \"pig,\" and \"pig-sty\" are usually regarded as\r\nsynonymous with all that is dirty and disgusting. His rolling in the mud\r\nis cited as a proof of his filthy habits. This practice, which he shares\r\nin common with all the pachydermatous animals, is undoubtedly the\r\nteaching of instinct, and for the purpose of cooling himself and keeping\r\noff flies.\r\n\r\nPigs are exceedingly fond of comfort and warmth, and will nestle\r\ntogether in order to obtain the latter, and often struggle vehemently to\r\nsecure the warmest berth. They are likewise peculiarly sensitive of\r\napproaching changes in the weather, and may often be observed suddenly\r\nleaving the places in which they had been quietly feeding, and running\r\noff to their styes at full speed, making loud outcries. When storms are\r\noverhanging, they collect straw in their mouths, and run about as if\r\ninviting their companions to do the same; and if there is a shed or\r\nshelter near at hand, they will carry it there and deposit it, as if for\r\nthe purpose of preparing a bed.\r\n\r\nIn their domesticated state, they are, undeniably, very greedy animals;\r\neating is the business of their lives; nor do they appear to be very\r\ndelicate as to the kind or quality of food which is placed before them.\r\nAlthough naturally herbivorous animals, they have been known to devour\r\ncarrion with all the voracity of beasts of prey, to eat and mangle\r\ninfants, and even gorge their appetites with their own young. It is not,\r\nhowever, unreasonable to believe that the last revolting act--rarely if\r\never happening in a state of nature--arises more from the pain and\r\nirritation produced by the state of confinement, and often filth, in\r\nwhich the animal is kept, and the disturbances to which it is subjected,\r\nthan from any actual ferocity; for it is well known that a sow is always\r\nunusually irritable at this period, snapping at all animals that\r\napproach her. If she is gently treated, properly supplied with\r\nsustenance, and sequestered from all annoyance, there is little danger\r\nof this practice ever happening.\r\n\r\nAll the offences which swine commit are attributed to a disposition\r\ninnately bad; whereas they too often arise from bad management, or total\r\nneglect. They are legitimate objects for the sport of idle boys, hunted\r\nwith curs, pelted with stones, often neglected and obliged to find a\r\nmeal for themselves, or wander about half-starved. Made thus the\r\nIshmaelites of our domestic animals, is it a matter of wonder that they\r\nshould, under such circumstances, incline to display Ishmaelitish\r\ntraits? In any well-regulated farm-yard, the swine are as tractable and\r\nas little disposed to wander or trespass as any of the animals that it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\nThe WILD BOAR is generally admitted to be the parent of the stock from\r\nwhich all our domesticated breeds and varieties have sprung. This animal\r\nis generally of a dusky brown or iron-gray color, inclining to black,\r\nand diversified with black spots or streaks. The body is covered with\r\ncoarse hairs, intermixed with a downy wool; these hairs become bristles\r\nas they approach the neck and shoulders, and are in those places so long\r\nas to form a mane, which the animal erects when irritated. The head is\r\nshort, the forehead broad and flat, the ears short, rounded at the tips,\r\nand inclined toward the neck, the jaw armed with sharp, crooked tusks,\r\nwhich curve slightly upward, and are capable of inflicting fearful\r\nwounds, the eye full, neck thick and muscular, the shoulders high, the\r\nloins broad, the tail stiff, and finished off with a tuft of bristles at\r\nthe tip, the haunch well turned, and the leg strong. A full-grown wild\r\nboar in India averages from thirty to forty inches in height at the\r\nshoulder; the African wild boar is about twenty-eight or thirty inches\r\nhigh.\r\n\r\nThe wild boar is a very active and powerful animal, and becomes fiercer\r\nas he grows older. When existing in a state of nature, he is generally\r\nfound in moist, shady, and well-wooded situations, not far remote from\r\nstreams or water. In India, they are found in the thick jungles, in\r\nplantations of sugar-cane or rice, or in the thick patches of high, long\r\ngrass. In England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, their resorts have\r\nbeen in the woods and forests. This animal is naturally herbivorous,\r\nand appears to feed by choice upon plants, fruits, and roots. He will,\r\nhowever, eat the worms and larvae which he finds in the ground, also\r\nsnakes and other such reptiles, and the eggs of birds. They seldom quit\r\ntheir coverts during the day, but prowl about in search of food during\r\ntwilight and the night. Their acute sense of smell enables them to\r\ndetect the presence of roots or fruits deeply imbedded in the soil, and\r\nthey often do considerable mischief by ploughing up the ground in search\r\nof them, particularly as they do not, like the common hog, root up a\r\nlittle spot here and there, but plough long, continuous, furrows.\r\n\r\nThe wild boar, properly so called, is neither a solitary nor a\r\ngregarious animal. For the first two or three years, the whole herd\r\nfollows the sow, and all unite in defence against any enemies, calling\r\nupon each other with loud cries in case of emergency, and forming in\r\nregular line of battle, the weakest occupying the rear. When arrived at\r\nmaturity, the animals wander alone, as if in perfect consciousness of\r\ntheir strength, and appear as if they neither sought nor avoided any\r\nliving creature. They are reputed to live about thirty years; as they\r\ngrow old, the hair becomes gray, and the tusks begin to show symptoms of\r\ndecay. Old boars rarely associate with a herd, but seem to keep apart\r\nfrom the rest, and from each other.\r\n\r\nThe female produces but one litter in the year, much smaller in number\r\nthan those of the domestic pig; she carries her young sixteen or twenty\r\nweeks, and generally is only seen with the male during the rutting\r\nseason. She suckles her young for several months, and continues to\r\nprotect them for some time afterward; if attacked at that time, she will\r\ndefend herself and them with exceeding courage and fierceness. Many\r\nsows will often be found herding together, each followed by her litter\r\nof young; and in such parties they are exceedingly formidable to man and\r\nbeast. Neither they nor the boar, however, seem desirous of attacking\r\nany thing; and only when roused by aggression, or disturbed in their\r\nretreat, do they turn upon their enemies and manifest the mighty\r\nstrength with which Nature has endowed them. When attacked by dogs, the\r\nwild boar at first sullenly retreats, turning upon them from time to\r\ntime and menacing them with his tusks; but gradually his anger rises,\r\nand at length he stands at bay, fights furiously for his life, and tears\r\nand rends his persecutors. He has even been observed to single out the\r\nmost tormenting of them, and rush savagely upon him. Hunting this animal\r\nhas been a favorite sport, in almost all countries in which it has been\r\nfound, from the earliest ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WILD BOAR AT BAY.]\r\n\r\nWild boars lingered in the forests of England and Scotland for several\r\ncenturies after the Norman conquest, and many tracts of land in those\r\ncountries derived their name from this circumstance; while instances of\r\nvalor in their destruction are recorded in the heraldic devices of many\r\nof their noble families. The precise period at which the animal became\r\nexterminated there cannot be precisely ascertained. They had, however,\r\nevidently been long extinct in the time of Charles I., since he\r\nendeavored to re-introduce them, and was at considerable expense to\r\nprocure a wild boar and his mate from Germany. They still exist in Upper\r\nAustria, on the Syrian Alps, in many parts of Hungary, and in the\r\nforests of Poland, Spain, Russia, and Sweden; and the inhabitants of\r\nthose countries hunt them with hounds, or attack them with fire-arms, or\r\nwith the proper boar-spear.\r\n\r\nAll the varieties of the domestic hog will breed with the wild boar; the\r\nperiod of gestation is the same in the wild and the tame sow; their\r\nanatomical structure is identical; their general form bears the same\r\ncharacters; and their habits, so far as they are not changed by\r\ndomestication, remain the same. Where individuals of the pure wild race\r\nhave been caught young and subjected to the same treatment as a domestic\r\npig, their fierceness has disappeared, they have become more social and\r\nless nocturnal in their habits, lost their activity, and lived more to\r\neat. In the course of one or two generations, even the form undergoes\r\ncertain modifications; the body becomes larger and heavier; the legs\r\nshorter, and less adapted for exercise; the formidable tusks of the\r\nboar, being no longer needed as weapons of defence, disappear; the shape\r\nof the head and neck alters; and in character as well as in form, the\r\nanimal adapts itself to its situation. Nor does it appear that a return\r\nto their native wilds restores to them their original appearance; for,\r\nin whatever country pigs have escaped from the control of man, and bred\r\nin the wilderness and woods, not a single instance is on record in which\r\nthey have resumed the habits and form of the wild boar. They, indeed,\r\nbecome fierce, wild, gaunt, and grisly, and live upon roots and fruits;\r\nbut they are, notwithstanding, merely degenerated swine, and they still\r\nassociate together in herds, and do not walk solitary and alone, like\r\ntheir grim ancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SWINE.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, swine have been an object of attention since its\r\nearliest settlement, and whenever a profitable market has been found for\r\npork abroad, it has been exported to the full extent of the demand.\r\nSwine are not, however, indigenous to this country, but were doubtless\r\noriginally brought hither by the early English settlers; and the breed\r\nthus introduced may still be distinguished by the traces they retain of\r\ntheir parent stock. France, also, as well as Spain, and, during the\r\nexistence of the slave-trade, Africa, have also combined to furnish\r\nvarieties of this animal, so much esteemed throughout the whole of the\r\ncountry, as furnishing a valuable article of food. For nearly twenty\r\nyears following the commencement of the general European wars, soon\r\nafter the organization of our national government, pork was a\r\ncomparatively large article of commerce; but exports for a time\r\ndiminished, and it was not until within a more recent period that this\r\nstaple has been brought up to its former standard as an article of\r\nexportation to that country. The recent use which has been made of its\r\ncarcass in converting it into lard oil, has tended to still further\r\nincrease its consumption. By the census of 1860, there were upward of\r\nthirty-two and a half millions of these animals in the United States.\r\n\r\nThey are reared in every part of the Union, and, when properly managed,\r\nalways at a fair profit. At the extreme North, in the neighborhood of\r\nlarge markets, and on such of the Southern plantations as are\r\nparticularly suited to sugar or rice, they should not be raised beyond\r\nthe number required for the consumption of the coarse or refuse food\r\nproduced. Swine are advantageously kept in connection with a dairy or\r\norchard; since, with little additional food besides what is thus\r\nafforded, they can be put in good condition for the butcher.\r\n\r\nOn the rich bottoms and other lands of the West, however, where Indian\r\ncorn is raised in profusion and at small expense, they can be reared in\r\nthe greatest numbers and yield the largest profit. The Scioto, Miami,\r\nWabash, Illinois, and other valleys, and extensive tracts in Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, Missouri, and some adjoining States, have for many years\r\ntaken the lead in the production of Swine; and it is probable that the\r\nclimate and soil, which are peculiarly suited to their rapid growth, as\r\nwell as that of their appropriate food, will enable them to hold their\r\nposition as the leading pork-producers of the North American Continent.\r\n\r\nThe breeds cultivated in this country are numerous; and, like our native\r\ncattle, they embrace many of the best, and a few of the worst, to be\r\nfound among the species. Great attention has been paid, for many years,\r\nto their improvement in the Eastern States; and nowhere are there better\r\nspecimens than in many of their yards. This spirit has rapidly extended\r\nWest and South; and among most of the intelligent farmers, who make them\r\na leading object of attention, on their rich corn-grounds, swine have\r\nattained a high degree of excellence. This does not consist in the\r\nintroduction and perpetuity of any distinct races, so much as in the\r\nbreeding up to a desirable size and aptitude for fattening, from such\r\nmeritorious individuals of any breed, or their crosses, as come within\r\ntheir reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BYEFIELD.\r\n\r\nThis breed was formerly in high repute in the Eastern States, and did\r\nmuch good among the species generally. They are white, with fine curly\r\nhair, well made and compact, moderate in size and length, with broad\r\nbacks, and at fifteen months attaining some three hundred to three\r\nhundred and fifty pounds net.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEDFORD.\r\n\r\nThe Bedford or Woburn is a breed originating with the Duke of Bedford,\r\non his estate at Woburn, and brought to their perfection, probably, by\r\njudicious crosses of the Chinese hog on some of the best English swine.\r\nA pair was sent by the duke to this country, as a present to General\r\nWashington; but they were dishonestly sold by the messenger, in\r\nMaryland, in which State, and in Pennsylvania, they were productive of\r\nmuch good at an early day, by their extensive distribution through\r\ndifferent States. Several other importations of this breed have been\r\nmade at various times, and especially by the enterprising masters of the\r\nLiverpool packets, in the neighborhood of New York. They are a large,\r\nspotted animal, well made, and inclining to early maturity and\r\nfattening. This is an exceedingly valuable hog, but nearly extinct, both\r\nin England and in this country, as a breed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEICESTER.\r\n\r\nThe old Leicestershire breed, in England, was a perfect type of the\r\noriginal hogs of the midland counties; large, ungainly, slab-sided\r\nanimals, of a light color, and spotted with brown or black. The only\r\ngood parts about them were their heads and ears, which showed greater\r\ntraces of breeding than any other portions. These have been materially\r\nimproved by various crosses, and the original breed has nearly lost all\r\nits peculiarities and defects. They may now be characterized as a large,\r\nwhite hog, generally coarse in the bone and hair, great eaters, and slow\r\nin maturing. Some varieties differ essentially in these particulars, and\r\nmature early on a moderate amount of food. The crosses with small\r\ncompact breeds are generally thrifty, desirable animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YORKSHIRE.\r\n\r\nThe old Yorkshire breed was one of the very large varieties, and one of\r\nthe most unprofitable for a farmer, being greedy feeders, difficult to\r\nfatten, and unsound in constitution. They were of a dirty white or\r\nyellow color, spotted with black, had long legs, flat sides, narrow\r\nbacks, weak loins, and large bones. Their hair was short and wirey, and\r\nintermingled with numerous bristles about the head and neck, and their\r\nears long. When full grown and fat, they seldom weighed more than from\r\nthree hundred and fifty to four hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThese have been crossed with pigs of the improved Leicester breed; and\r\nwhere the crossings have been judiciously managed, and not carried too\r\nfar, a fine race of deep-sided, short-legged, thin-haired animals has\r\nbeen obtained, fattening kindly, and rising to a weight of from two\r\nhundred and fifty to four hundred pounds, when killed between one and\r\ntwo years old; and when kept over two years, reaching even from five\r\nhundred to seven hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nThey have also been crossed with the Chinese, Neapolitan, and Berkshire\r\nbreeds, and hardy, profitable, well-proportioned animals thereby\r\nobtained. The original breed, in its purity, size, and defectiveness, is\r\nnow hardly to be met with, having shared the fate of the other large old\r\nbreeds, and given place to smaller and more symmetrical animals. The\r\n_Yorkshire white_ is among the large breeds deserving commendation among\r\nus. To the same class belong also the large _Miami white_, and the\r\n_Kenilworth_; each frequently attaining, when dressed, a weight of from\r\nsix hundred to eight hundred pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINESE.\r\n\r\nThis hog is to be found in the south-eastern countries of Asia, as Siam,\r\nCochin China, the Burman Empire, Cambodia, Malacca, Sumatra, and in\r\nBatavia, and other Eastern islands; and is, without doubt, the parent\r\nstock of the best European and American swine.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct varieties, the _white_ and the _black_; both\r\nfatten readily, but from their diminutive size attain no great weight.\r\nThey are small in limb, round in body, short in the head, wide in the\r\ncheek, and high in the chime; covered with very fine bristles growing\r\nfrom an exceedingly thin skin; and not peculiarly symmetrical, since,\r\nwhen fat, the head is so buried in the neck that little more than the\r\ntip of the snout is visible. The pure Chinese is too delicate and\r\nsusceptible to cold ever to become a really profitable animal in this\r\ncountry; it is difficult to rear, and the sows are not good nurses; but\r\none or two judicious crosses have, in a manner, naturalized it. This\r\nbreed will fatten readily, and on a comparatively small quantity of\r\nfood; the flesh is exceedingly delicate, but does not make good bacon,\r\nand is often too fat and oily to be generally esteemed as pork. They are\r\nchiefly kept by those who rear sucking-pigs for the market, as they make\r\nexcellent roasters at three weeks or a month old. Five, and even seven,\r\nvarieties of this breed are distinguished, but these are doubtless the\r\nresults of different crosses with our native kinds; among these are\r\nblack, white, black and white, spotted, blue and white, and sandy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHINESE HOG.]\r\n\r\nMany valuable crosses have been made with these animals; for the\r\nprevalent fault of the old English breeds having been coarseness of\r\nflesh, unwieldiness of form, and want of aptitude to fatten, an\r\nadmixture of the Chinese breed has materially corrected these defects.\r\nMost of our smaller breeds are more or less indebted to the Asiatic\r\nswine for their present compactness of form, the readiness with which\r\nthey fatten on a small quantity of food, and their early maturity; but\r\nthese advantages are not considered, in the judgment of some, as\r\nsufficiently great to compensate for the diminution in size, the\r\nincreased delicacy of the animals, and the decrease of number in the\r\nlitters. The best cross is between the Berkshire and Chinese.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFOLK.\r\n\r\nThe old Suffolks are white in color, long-legged, long-bodied, with\r\nnarrow backs, broad foreheads, short hams, and an abundance of bristles.\r\nThey are by no means profitable animals. A cross between the Suffolk and\r\nLincoln has produced a hardy animal, which fattens kindly, and attains\r\nthe weight of from four hundred to five hundred and fifty, and even\r\nseven hundred pounds. Another cross, much approved by farmers, is that\r\nof the Suffolk and Berkshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SUFFOLK PIG.]\r\n\r\nThere are few better breeds, perhaps, than the improved Suffolk--that\r\nis, the Suffolk crossed with the Chinese. The greater part of the pigs\r\non the late Prince Albert's farm, near Windsor, were of this breed. They\r\nare well-formed, compact, of medium size, with round, bulky bodies,\r\nshort legs, small heads, and fat cheeks. Many, at a year or fifteen\r\nmonths old, weigh from two hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds;\r\nat which age they make fine bacon hogs. The sucking-pigs are also very\r\ndelicate and delicious.\r\n\r\nThose arising from Berkshire and Suffolk are not so well shaped as the\r\nlatter, being coarser, longer-legged, and more prominent about the hips.\r\nThey are mostly white, with thin, fine hair; some few are spotted, and\r\nare easily kept in fine condition; they have a decided aptitude to\r\nfatten early, and are likewise valuable as store-pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BERKSHIRE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BERKSHIRE BOAR.]\r\n\r\nThe Berkshire pigs belong to the large class, and are distinguished by\r\ntheir color, which is a sandy or whitish brown, spotted regularly with\r\ndark brown or black spots, and by their having no bristles. The hair is\r\nlong, thin, somewhat curly, and looks rough; the ears are fringed with\r\nlong hair round the outer edge, which gives them a ragged or feathery\r\nappearance; the body is thick, compact, and well formed; the legs short,\r\nthe sides broad, the head well set on, the snout short, the jowl thick,\r\nthe ears erect, skin exceedingly thin in texture, the flesh firm and\r\nwell flavored, and the bacon very superior. This breed has generally\r\nbeen considered one of the best in England, on account of its smallness\r\nof bone, early maturity, aptitude to fatten on little food, hardihood,\r\nand the females being good breeders. Hogs of the pure original breed\r\nhave been known to weigh from eight hundred to nine hundred and fifty\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nNumerous crosses have been made from this breed; the principal foreign\r\nones are those with the Chinese and Neapolitan swine, made with the view\r\nof decreasing the size of the animal, improving the flavor of the flesh,\r\nand rendering it more delicate; and the animals thus attained are\r\nsuperior to almost any others in their aptitude to fatten; but are very\r\nsusceptible to cold, from being almost entirely without hair. A cross\r\nwith the Suffolk and Norfolk also is much improved, which produces a\r\nhardy kind, yielding well when sent to the butcher; although, under most\r\ncircumstances, the pure Berkshire is the best.\r\n\r\nNo other breeds have been so extensively diffused in the United States,\r\nwithin comparatively so brief a period, as the Berkshires, and they have\r\nproduced a marked improvement in many of our former races. They weigh\r\nvariously, from two hundred and fifty to four hundred pounds net, at\r\nsixteen months, according to their food and style of breeding; and some\r\nfull-grown have dressed to more than eight hundred pounds. They\r\nparticularly excel in their hams, which are round, full, and heavy, and\r\ncontain a large proportion of lean, tender, and juicy meat, of the best\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nNone of our improved breeds afford long, coarse hair or bristles; and it\r\nis a gratifying evidence of our decided improvement in this department\r\nof domestic animals, that our brush-makers are obliged to import most of\r\nwhat they use from Russia and northern Europe. This improvement is\r\nmanifest not only in the hair, but in the skin, which is soft and mellow\r\nto the touch; in the finer bones, shorter head, upright ears, dishing\r\nface, delicate muzzle, and wild eye; and in the short legs, low flanks,\r\ndeep and wide chest, broad back, and early maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE HOG.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF THE HOG AS COVERED BY THE MUSCLES.\r\n\r\n1.

Of this genus there are five\r\nvarieties.\r\n    _Sus Scropa_, or Domestic Hog.\r\n    _Sus Papuensis_, or Bene.\r\n    _Sus Guineensis_, or Guinea Hog.\r\n    _Sus Africanus_, or Masked Boar.\r\n    _Sus Babirussa_, or Babirussa.\r\n\r\nA very slight comparison of the face of this animal with that of any\r\nother will prove that strength is the object in view--strength toward\r\nthe inferior part of the bone. In point of fact, the snout of the hog is\r\nhis spade, with which, in his natural state, he digs and ruts in the\r\nground for roots, earth-nuts, worms, etc. To render this implement more\r\nnearly perfect, an extra bone is added to the nasal bone, being\r\nconnected with it by strong ligaments, cartilages, and muscles, and\r\ntermed the snout-bone, or spade-bone, or ploughshare. By it and its\r\ncartilaginous attachment, the snout is rendered strong as well as\r\nflexible, and far more efficient than it otherwise could be; and the hog\r\noften continues to give both farmers and gardeners very unpleasant\r\nproofs of its efficiency, by ploughing up deep furrows in newly-sown\r\nfields, and grubbing up the soil in all directions in quest of living\r\nand dead food.\r\n\r\nAs roots and fruits buried in the earth form the natural food of the\r\nhog, his face terminates in this strong, muscular snout, insensible at\r\nthe extremity, and perfectly adapted for turning up the soil. There is a\r\nlarge plexus or fold of nerves proceeding down each side of the nose;\r\nand in these, doubtless, resides that peculiar power which enables the\r\nhog to select his food, though buried some inches below the surface of\r\nthe ground. The olfactory nerve is likewise large, and occupies a middle\r\nrank between that of the herbivorous and carnivorous animals; it is\r\ncomparatively larger than that of the ox; indeed, few animals--with the\r\nexception of the dog, none--are gifted with a more acute sense of smell\r\nthan the hog. To it epicures are indebted for the truffles which form\r\nsuch a delicious sauce, for they are the actual finders. A pig is turned\r\ninto a field, allowed to pursue his own course, and watched. He stops,\r\nand begins to grub up the earth; the man hurries up, drives him away,\r\nand secures the truffle, which is invariably growing under that spot;\r\nand the poor pig goes off to sniff out another, and another, only now\r\nand then being permitted, by way of encouragement, to reap the fruits of\r\nhis research.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMATION OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe hog has fourteen _molar_ teeth in each jaw, six _incisors_, and two\r\n_canines_; these latter are curved upward, and commonly denominated\r\n_tushes_. The molar teeth are all slightly different in structure, and\r\nincrease in size from first to last; they bear no slight resemblance to\r\nthose of the human being. The incisors are so fantastic in form that\r\nthey cannot well be described, and their destined functions are by no\r\nmeans clear. Those in the lower jaw are long, round, and nearly\r\nstraight; of those in the upper jaw, four closely resemble the\r\ncorresponding teeth in the horse; while the two corner incisors bear\r\nsomething of the shape of those of the dog. These latter are placed so\r\nnear the tushes as often to obstruct their growth, and it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to draw them, in order to relieve the animal and enable him to\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\nThe hog is born with two molars on each side of the jaw; by the time he\r\nis three or four months old, he is provided with his incisive milk-teeth\r\nand the tushes; the supernumerary molars protrude between the fifth and\r\nseventh month, as does the first back molar; the second back molar is\r\ncut at about the age of ten months; and the third, generally, not until\r\nthe animal is three years old. The upper corner teeth are shed at about\r\nthe age of six or eight months; and the lower ones at about seven, nine,\r\nor ten months old, and replaced by the permanent ones. The milk tushes\r\nare also shed and replaced between six and ten months old. The age of\r\ntwenty months, and from that to two years, is denoted by the shedding\r\nand replacement of the middle incisors, or _pincers_, in both jaws, and\r\nthe formation of a black circle at the base of each of the tushes. At\r\nabout two years and a half or three years of age, the adult middle teeth\r\nin both jaws protrude, and the pincers are becoming black and rounded at\r\nthe ends.\r\n\r\nAfter three years, the age may be computed by the growth of the tushes;\r\nat about four years, or rather before, the upper tushes begin to raise\r\nthe lip; at five, they protrude through the lips; and at six years, the\r\ntushes of the lower jaw begin to show themselves out of the mouth, and\r\nassume a spiral form. These acquire a prodigious length in old animals,\r\nand particularly in uncastrated boars; and as they increase in size,\r\nthey become curved backward and outward, and at length are so crooked as\r\nto interfere with the motion of the jaws to such a degree that it is\r\nnecessary to cut off those projecting teeth, which is done with the\r\nfile, or with nippers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBREEDING AND MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING\r\n\r\nIn the selection of a boar and sow for breeding, much more attention and\r\nconsideration are requisite than is generally imagined. It is as easy,\r\nwith a very little judgment and management, to procure a good as an\r\ninferior breed; and the former is much more remunerative, in proportion\r\nto the outlay, than the latter can possibly ever be.\r\n\r\nThe object of the farmer or breeder is to produce and retain such an\r\nanimal as will be best adapted to the purpose he has in view, whether\r\nthat is the consumption of certain things which could not otherwise be\r\nso well disposed of, the converting into hams, bacon, and pork, or the\r\nraising of sucking-pigs and porkers for the market. Almost all farmers\r\nkeep one or more pigs to devour the offal and refuse, which would\r\notherwise be wasted. This is, however, a matter totally distinct from\r\nbreeding swine. In the former case, the animal or animals are purchased\r\nyoung for a small price, each person buying as many as he considers he\r\nshall have food enough for, and then sold to the butcher, or killed,\r\nwhen in proper condition; and thus a certain degree of profit is\r\nrealized. In the latter, many contingencies must be taken into account:\r\nthe available means of feeding them; whether or not the food may be more\r\nprofitably disposed of; the facilities afforded by railroads, the\r\nvicinity of towns, or large markets, etc., for disposing of them.\r\n\r\nIn the breeding of swine, as much as that of any other livestock, it is\r\nimportant to pay great attention, not only to the breed, but also to the\r\nchoice of individuals. The sow should produce a great number of young\r\nones, and she must be well fed to enable her to support them. Some sows\r\nbring forth ten, twelve, or even fifteen pigs at a birth; but eight or\r\nnine is the usual number; and sows which produce fewer than this must be\r\nrejected. It is, however, probable that fecundity depends also on the\r\nboar; he should, therefore, be chosen from a race which multiplies\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nIf a bacon and a late market be objects, the large and heavy varieties\r\nshould be selected, care being taken that the breed has the character of\r\npossessing those qualities most likely to insure a heavy return--growth,\r\nand facility of taking fat. Good one-year bacon-hogs being in great\r\ndemand, they may be known by their long bodies, low bellies, and short\r\nlegs. With these qualities are usually coupled long, pendulous ears,\r\nwhich attract purchasers. If, however, hogs are to be sold at all\r\nseasons to the butchers, the animals must attain their full growth and\r\nbe ready for killing before they are a year old. This quality is\r\nparticularly prominent in the Chinese breed; but among our ordinary\r\nvarieties, hogs are often met with better adapted for this purpose than\r\nfor producing large quantities of bacon and lard. The Berkshire crossed\r\nwith Chinese is an excellent porker.\r\n\r\nThe sow should be chosen from a breed of proper size and shape, sound\r\nand free from blemishes and defects. In every case--whether the object\r\nbe pork or bacon--the _points_ to be looked for in the _sow_ are a\r\nsmall, lively head; a broad and deep chest; round ribs; capacious\r\nbarrel; a haunch falling almost to the hough; deep and broad loin; ample\r\nhips; and considerable length of body, in proportion to its height. One\r\nqualification should ever be kept in view, and, perhaps, should be the\r\nfirst point to which the attention should be directed--that is,\r\nsmallness of bone. She should have at least twelve teats; for it is\r\nobserved that each pig selects a teat for himself and keeps to it, so\r\nthat a pig not having one belonging to him would be starved. A good sow\r\nshould produce a great number of pigs, all of equal vigor. She must be\r\nvery careful of them, and not crush them by her weight; above all, she\r\nmust not be addicted to eating the after-birth, and, what may often\r\nfollow, her own young. If a sow is tainted with those bad habits, or if\r\nshe has difficult labors, or brings forth dead pigs, she must be spayed\r\nforthwith. It is, therefore, well to bring up several young sows at\r\nonce, so as to keep those only which are free from defects. Breeding\r\nsows and boars should never be raised from defective animals. Sows that\r\nhave very low bellies, almost touching the ground, seldom produce large\r\nor fine litters. A good-sized sow is generally considered more likely to\r\nprove a good breeder and nurse, and to farrow more easily and safely\r\nthan a small, delicate animal.\r\n\r\nThe ancients considered the distinguishing marks of a good _boar_ to be\r\na small head, short legs, a long body, large thighs and neck, and this\r\nlatter part thickly covered with strong, erect bristles. The most\r\nexperienced modern breeders prefer an animal with a long, cylindrical\r\nbody; small bones; well-developed muscles; a wide chest, which denotes\r\nstrength of constitution; a broad, straight back; short head and fine\r\nsnout; brilliant eyes; a short, thick neck; broad, well-developed\r\nshoulders; a loose, mellow skin; fine, bright, long hair, and few\r\nbristles; and small legs and hips. Some give the preference to long,\r\nflapping ears; but experience seems to demonstrate that those animals\r\nare best which have short, erect, fine ears. The boar should always be\r\nvigorous and masculine in appearance.\r\n\r\nFew domesticated animals suffer so much from in-and-in breeding as\r\nswine. Where this system is pursued, the number of young ones is\r\ndecreased at every litter, until the sows become, in a manner, barren.\r\nThis practice also undoubtedly contributes to their liability to\r\nhereditary diseases, such as scrofula, epilepsy, and rheumatism; and\r\nwhen those possessing any such diseases are coupled, the ruin of the\r\nflock is easily and speedily effected, since they are propagated by\r\neither parent, and always most certainly and in most aggravated form,\r\nwhen occurring in both. As soon as the slightest degeneracy is observed,\r\nthe breed should be crossed from time to time, keeping sight, however,\r\nwhile so doing, of the end in view. The Chinese will generally be found\r\nthe best which can be used for this purpose; since a single cross, and\r\neven two, with one of these animals, will seldom do harm, but often\r\neffect considerable improvements. The best formed of the progeny\r\nresulting from this cross must be selected as breeders, and with them\r\nthe old original stock crossed back again. Selection, with judicious and\r\ncautious admixture, is the true secret of forming and improving the\r\nbreed. Repeated and indiscriminate crosses are as injurious as an\r\nobstinate adherence to one particular breed, and as much to be avoided.\r\n\r\nThe following rules for the selection of the best stock of hogs will\r\napply to all breeds:\r\n\r\n_Fertility._ In a breeding sow, this quality is essential, and it is one\r\nwhich is inherited. Besides this, she should be a careful mother. A\r\nyoung, untried sow will generally display in her tendencies those which\r\nhave predominated in the race from which she has descended. Both boar\r\nand sow should be sound, healthy, and in fair, but not over fat,\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n_Form._ Where a farmer has an excellent breed, but with certain defects,\r\nor too long in the limb, or too heavy in the bone, the sire to be\r\nchosen, whether of a pure or of a cross breed, should exhibit the\r\nopposite qualities, even to an extreme; and be, moreover, one of a\r\nstrain noted for early and rapid fattening. If in perfect health, young\r\nstock selected for breeding will be lively, animated, hold up the head,\r\nand move freely and nimbly.\r\n\r\n_Bristles._ These should be fine and scanty, so as to show the skin\r\nsmooth and glossy; coarse, wirey, rough bristles usually accompany heavy\r\nbones, large, spreading hoofs, and flapping ears, and thus become one of\r\nthe indications of a thick-skinned and low breed.\r\n\r\n_Color._ Different breeds of high excellence have their own colors;\r\nwhite, black, parti-colored, black and white, sandy, mottled with large\r\nmarks of black, are the most prevalent. A black skin, with short, scanty\r\nbristles, and small stature, demonstrate the prevalence of the\r\nNeapolitan strain, or the black Chinese, or, perhaps, an admixture of\r\nboth. Many prefer white; and in sucking-pigs, destined for the table,\r\nand for porkers, this color has its advantages, and the skin looks more\r\nattractive; it is, however, generally thought that the skin of black\r\nhogs is thinner than that of white, and less subject to eruptive\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nThe influence of a first impregnation upon subsequent progeny by other\r\nmales is at times curiously illustrated. This has been noticed in\r\nrespect of the sow. A sow of the black and white breed, in one instance,\r\nbecame pregnant by a boar of the wild breed of a deep chestnut color.\r\nThe pigs produced were duly mixed, the color of the boar being very\r\npredominant in some. The sow being afterwards put to a boar of the same\r\nbreed as herself, some of the produce were still stained or marked with\r\nthe chestnut color which prevailed in the first litter; and the same\r\noccurred after a third impregnation, the boar being then of the same\r\nkind as herself. What adds to the force of this case is, that in the\r\ncourse of many years' observation, the breed in question was never\r\nknown to produce progeny having the slightest tinge of chestnut color.\r\n\r\nA sow is capable of conceiving at the age of six or seven months; but it\r\nis always better not to let her commence breeding too early, as it tends\r\nto weaken her. From ten to twelve months--and the latter is\r\npreferable--is about the best age. The boar should be, at least, a\r\ntwelvemonth old--some even recommend eighteen months, at least--before\r\nhe is employed for the purpose of propagating his species. If, however,\r\nthe sow has attained her second year, and the boar his third, a vigorous\r\nand numerous offspring is more likely to result. The boar and sow retain\r\ntheir ability to breed for almost five years; that is, until the former\r\nis upward of eight years old, and the latter seven. It is not advisable,\r\nhowever, to use a boar after he has passed his fifth year, nor a sow\r\nafter her fourth, unless she has proved a peculiarly valuable\r\nbreeder--in which case she might produce two or three more litters.\r\n\r\nA boar left on the pasture, at liberty with the sows, might suffice for\r\nthirty or forty of them; but as he is commonly shut up, and allowed\r\naccess at stated times only, so that the young ones may be born at\r\nnearly the same time, it is usual to allow him to serve from six to\r\nten--on no account should he serve more. The best plan is, to shut up\r\nthe boar and sow in a sty together; for, when turned in among several\r\nfemales, he is apt to ride them so often that he exhausts himself\r\nwithout effect. The breeding boar should be fed well and kept in high\r\ncondition, but not fat. Full grown boars being often savage and\r\ndifficult to tame, and prone to attack men and animals, should be\r\ndeprived of their tusks.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is practicable, it should always be so arranged that the\r\nanimals shall farrow early in the spring, and at the latter end of\r\nsummer, or quite the beginning of autumn. In the former case, the young\r\npigs will have the run of the early pastures, which will be a benefit to\r\nthem, and a saving to their owners; and there will also be more whey,\r\nmilk, and other dairy produce which can be spared for them by the time\r\nthey are ready to be weaned. In the second case, there will be\r\nsufficient time for the young to have grown and acquired strength before\r\nthe cold weather comes on, which is always very injurious to\r\nsucking-pigs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS OF A GOOD HOG.\r\n\r\nIt may be not amiss to group together what is deemed desirable under\r\nthis head. No one should be led away by mere name in his selection of a\r\nhog. It may be called a Berkshire, or a Suffolk, or any other breed most\r\nin estimation, and yet, in reality, may possess none of this valuable\r\nblood. The only sure way to avoid imposition is, to make _name_ always\r\nsecondary to _points_. If a hog is found possessing such points of form\r\nas are calculated to insure early maturity and faculty of taking on\r\nflesh, one needs to care but little by what name he is called; since no\r\nmere name can bestow value upon an animal deficient in the qualities\r\nalready indicated.\r\n\r\nThe true Berkshire--that possessing a dash of the Chinese and Neapolitan\r\nvarieties--comes, perhaps, nearer to the desired standard than any\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe chief points which characterize such a hog are the following:--In\r\nthe first place, sufficient depth of carcass, and such an elongation of\r\nbody as will insure a sufficient lateral expansion. The loin and breast\r\nshould be broad. The breadth of the former denotes good room for the\r\nplay of the lungs, and, as a consequence, a free and healthy\r\ncirculation, essential to the thriving or fattening of any animal. The\r\nbone should be small, and the joints fine--nothing is more indicative of\r\nhigh breeding than this; and the legs should be no longer than, when\r\nfully fat, would just prevent the animal's belly from trailing upon the\r\nground. The leg is the least profitable portion of the hog, and no more\r\nof it is required than is absolutely necessary for the support of the\r\nrest. The feet should be firm and sound; the toes should lie well\r\ntogether, and press straightly upon the ground; the claws, also, should\r\nbe even, upright and healthy.\r\n\r\nThe form of the head is sometimes deemed of little or no consequence, it\r\nbeing generally, perhaps, supposed that a good hog may have an ugly\r\nhead; but the head of all animals is one of the very principal points in\r\nwhich pure or impure breeding will be most obviously indicated. A\r\nhigh-bred animal will invariably be found to arrive more speedily at\r\nmaturity, to take flesh more easily, and at an earlier period, and,\r\naltogether, to turn out more profitably than one of questionable or\r\nimpure stock. Such being the case, the head of the hog is a point by no\r\nmeans to be overlooked. The description of head most likely to\r\npromise--or, rather to be the accompaniment of--high breeding, is one\r\nnot carrying heavy bones, not too flat on the forehead, or possessing a\r\nsnout too elongated; the snout should be short, and the forehead rather\r\nconvex, curving upward; and the ear, while pendulous, should incline\r\nsomewhat forward, and at the same time be light and thin. The carriage\r\nof the pig should also be noticed. If this be dull, heavy, and dejected,\r\none may reasonably suspect ill health, if not some concealed disorder\r\nactually existing, or just about to break forth; and there cannot be a\r\nmore unfavorable symptom than a hung-down, slouching head. Of course, a\r\nfat hog for slaughter and a sow heavy with young, have not much\r\nsprightliness of deportment.\r\n\r\nColor is, likewise, not to be disregarded. Those colors are preferable\r\nwhich are characteristic of the most esteemed breeds. If the hair is\r\nscant, black is desirable, as denoting connection with the Neapolitan;\r\nif too bare of hair, a too intimate alliance with that variety may be\r\napprehended, and a consequent want of hardihood, which--however\r\nunimportant, if pork be the object--renders such animals a hazardous\r\nspeculation for store purposes, on account of their extreme\r\nsusceptibility of cold, and consequent liability to disease. If white,\r\nand not too small, they are valuable as exhibiting connection with the\r\nChinese. If light, or sandy, or red with black marks, the favorite\r\nBerkshire is detected; and so on, with reference to every possible\r\nvariety of hue.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT DURING PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nSows with pigs should be well and judiciously fed; that is to say, they\r\nshould have a sufficiency of wholesome, nutritious food to maintain\r\ntheir strength and keep them in good condition, but should by no means\r\nbe allowed to get fat; as when they are in high condition, the dangers\r\nof parturition are enhanced, the animal is more awkward and liable to\r\nsmother and crush her young, and, moreover, never has as much or as good\r\nmilk as a leaner sow. She should also have a separate sty; for swine are\r\nprone to lie so close together that, if she is even among others, her\r\nyoung would be in great danger; and this sty should be perfectly clean\r\nand comfortably littered, but not so thickly as to admit of the young\r\nbeing able to bury themselves in the straw.\r\n\r\nAs the time of her farrowing approaches, she should be well supplied\r\nwith food, especially if she be a young sow, and this her first litter,\r\nand also carefully watched, in order to prevent her devouring the\r\nafter-birth, and thus engendering a morbid appetite which will next\r\ninduce her to fall upon her own young. A sow that has once done this can\r\nnever afterward be depended upon. Hunger, thirst, or irritation of any\r\nkind, will often induce this unnatural conduct, which is another reason\r\nwhy a sow about to farrow should have a sty to herself, and be carefully\r\nattended to, and have all her wants supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means of so common occurrence in the case of the sow as in\r\nmany other of the domesticated animals. Various causes tend to produce\r\nit: insufficiency of food, eating too much succulent vegetable food, or\r\nunwholesome, unsubstantial diet; blows and falls; and the animal's habit\r\nof rubbing itself against hard bodies, for the purpose of allaying the\r\nirritation produced by the vermin or cutaneous eruptions to which it is\r\nsubject. Reiterated copulation does not appear to produce abortion in\r\nthe sow; at least to the extent it does in other animals.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms indicative of approaching abortion are similar to those of\r\nparturition, but more intense. There are, generally, restlessness,\r\nirritation, and shivering; and the cries of the animal evince the\r\npresence of severe labor-pains. Sometimes the rectum, vagina, or\r\nuterus, becomes relaxed, and one or the other protrudes, and often\r\nbecomes inverted at the moment of the expulsion of the f[oe]tus,\r\npreceded by the placenta, which presents itself foremost.\r\n\r\nNothing can be done, at the last hour, to prevent abortion; but, from\r\nthe first, every predisposing cause should be removed. The treatment\r\nwill depend upon circumstances. Where the animal is young, vigorous, and\r\nin high condition, bleeding will be beneficial--not a copious\r\nblood-letting, but small quantities taken at different times; purgatives\r\nmay also be administered. If, when abortion has taken place, the whole\r\nof the litter was not born, emollient injections may be resorted to with\r\nconsiderable benefit; otherwise, the after treatment should be made the\r\nsame as in parturition, and the animal should be kept warm, quiet, and\r\nclean, and allowed a certain degree of liberty. Whenever one sow has\r\naborted, the causes likely to have produced this accident should be\r\nsought, and an endeavor made, by removing them, to secure the rest of\r\nthe inmates of the piggery from a similar mishap.\r\n\r\nIn cases of abortion, the f[oe]tus is seldom born alive, and often has\r\nbeen dead for some days; where this is the case--which may be readily\r\ndetected by a peculiarly unpleasant putrid exhalation, and the discharge\r\nof a fetid liquid from the vagina--the parts should be washed with a\r\ndiluted solution of chloride of lime, in the proportion of one part of\r\nchloride to three parts of water, and a portion of this lotion gently\r\ninjected into the uterus, if the animal will submit to it. Mild doses of\r\nEpsom salts, tincture of gentian, and Jamaica ginger, will also act\r\nbeneficially in such cases, and, with attention to diet, soon restores\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTURITION.\r\n\r\nThe period of gestation varies according to age, constitution, food, and\r\nthe peculiarities of the individual breed. The most usual period during\r\nwhich the sow carries her young is, according to some, three months,\r\nthree weeks, and three days, or one hundred and eight days; according to\r\nothers, four lunar months, or sixteen weeks, or about one hundred and\r\nthirteen days. It may safely be said to range from one hundred and nine\r\nto one hundred and forty-three days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD HOGS.]\r\n\r\nThe sow produces from eight to thirteen young at a litter, and sometimes\r\neven more. Young and weakly sows not only produce fewer pigs, but farrow\r\nearlier than those of maturer age and sounder condition; and besides, as\r\nmight be expected, their offspring are deficient in vigor, oftentimes,\r\nindeed, puny and feeble. Extraordinary fecundity is not however,\r\ndesirable, for nourishment cannot be afforded to more than twelve, the\r\nsow's number of teats. The supernumerary pigs must therefore suffer; if\r\nbut one, it is, of course, the smallest and weakest; a too numerous\r\nlitter are all, indeed, generally undersized and weakly, and seldom or\r\nnever prove profitable; a litter not exceeding ten will usually be found\r\nto turn out most advantageously. On account of the discrepancy between\r\nthe number farrowed by different sows, it is a good plan, if it can be\r\nmanaged, to have more than one breeding at the same time, in order that\r\nthe number to be suckled by each may be equalized. The sow seldom\r\nrecognizes the presence of a strange little one, if it has been\r\nintroduced among the others during her absence, and has lain for half an\r\nhour or so among her own offspring in their sty.\r\n\r\nThe approach of the period of farrowing is marked by the immense size of\r\nthe belly, by a depression of the back, and by the distention of the\r\nteats. The animal manifests symptoms of acute suffering, and wanders\r\nrestlessly about, collecting straw, and carrying it to her sty, grunting\r\npiteously meanwhile. As soon as this is observed, she should be\r\npersuaded into a separate sty, and carefully watched. On no account\r\nshould several sows be permitted to farrow in the same place at the same\r\ntime, as they will inevitably irritate each other, or devour their own\r\nor one another's young.\r\n\r\nThe young ones should be taken away as soon as they are born, and\r\ndeposited in a warm spot; for the sow being a clumsy animal, is not\r\nunlikely in her struggles to overlie them; nor should they be returned\r\nto her, until all is over, and the after-birth has been removed, which\r\nshould always be done the moment it passes from her; for young sows,\r\nespecially, will invariably devour it, if permitted, and then, as the\r\nyoung are wet with a similar fluid, and smell the same they will eat\r\nthem also, one after another. Some advise washing the backs of young\r\npigs with a decoction of aloes, colocynth, or some other nauseous\r\nsubstance, as a remedy for this; but the simplest and easiest one is to\r\nremove the little ones until all is over, and the mother begins to\r\nrecover herself and seek about for them, when they should be put near\r\nher. Some also recommend strapping up the sow's mouth for the first\r\nthree or four days, only releasing it to admit of her taking her meals.\r\n\r\nSome sows are apt to lie upon and crush their young. This may best be\r\navoided by not keeping her too fat or heavy, and by not leaving too many\r\nyoung upon her. The straw forming the bed should likewise be short, and\r\nnot in too great quantity, lest the pigs get huddled up under it, and\r\nthe sow unconsciously overlie them in that condition.\r\n\r\nIt does not always happen that the parturition is effected with ease.\r\nCases of false presentation, of enlarged f[oe]tus, and of debility in\r\nthe mother, often render it difficult and dangerous. The womb will\r\noccasionally become protruded and inverted, in consequence of the\r\nforcing pains of difficult parturition, and even the bladder has been\r\nknown to come away. These parts must be returned as soon as may be; and\r\nif the womb has come in contact with the dung or litter, and acquired\r\nany dirt, it must first be washed in lukewarm water, and then returned,\r\nand confined in its place by means of a suture passed through the lips\r\nof the orifice. The easiest and perhaps the best way, however, is not to\r\nreturn the protruded parts at all, but merely tie a ligature round them\r\nand leave them to slough off, which they will do in the course of a few\r\ndays, without effusion of blood, or farther injury to the animal. No\r\nsow that has once suffered from protrusion of the womb should be\r\nallowed to breed again.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT WHILE SUCKLING.\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon this; as many a fine sow and promising litter have\r\nbeen ruined for want of proper and judicious care at this period.\r\nImmediately after farrowing, many sows incline to be feverish; where\r\nthis is the case, a light and sparing diet only should be given them for\r\nthe first day or two, as gruel, oatmeal porridge, whey, and the like.\r\nOthers, again, are very much debilitated, and require strengthening; for\r\nthem, strong soup, bread steeped in wine, or in a mixture of brandy and\r\nsweet spirits of nitre, administered in small quantities, will often\r\nprove highly beneficial.\r\n\r\nThe rations must gradually be increased and given more frequently; and\r\nthey must be composed of wholesome, nutritious, and succulent\r\nsubstances. All kinds of roots--carrots, turnips, potatoes, and\r\nbeet-roots--well steamed or boiled, but never raw, may be given; bran,\r\nbarley, and oatmeal, bran-flour, Indian corn, whey, sour, skim, and\r\nbutter-milk, are all well adapted for this period; and, should the\r\nanimal appear to require it, grain well bruised and macerated may be\r\nadded. Whenever it is possible, the sow should be turned out for an hour\r\neach day, to graze in a meadow or clover-field, as the fresh air,\r\nexercise, and herbage, will do her immense good. The young pigs must be\r\nshut up for the first ten days or fortnight, after which they will be\r\nable to follow her, and take their share of the benefit.\r\n\r\nThe food should be given regularly at certain hours; small and\r\noften-repeated meals are far preferable to large ones, since\r\nindigestion, or any disarrangement of the functions of the stomach\r\nvitiates the milk, and produces diarrh[oe]a and other similar affections\r\nin the young. The mother should always be well fed, but not over-fed;\r\nthe better and more carefully she is fed, the more abundant and\r\nnutritious will her milk be, the better will the sucking-pigs thrive,\r\nand the less will she be reduced by suckling them.\r\n\r\nWhen a sow is weakly, and has not a sufficiency of milk, the young pigs\r\nmust be taught to feed as early as possible. A kind of gruel, made of\r\nskim-milk and bran, or oatmeal, is a good thing for this purpose, or\r\npotatoes, boiled and then mashed in milk or whey, with or without the\r\naddition of a little bran or oatmeal. Toward the period when the pigs\r\nare to be weaned, the sow must be less plentifully fed, otherwise the\r\nsecretion of milk will be as great as ever; it will, besides,\r\naccumulate, and there will be hardness, and perhaps inflammation of the\r\nteats. If necessary, a dose of physic may be given to assist in carrying\r\noff the milk; but, in general, a little judicious management in the\r\nfeeding and weaning will be all that is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF YOUNG PIGS.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten days, or a fortnight, the mother will generally be\r\nable to support her litter without assistance, unless, as has been\r\nalready observed, she is weakly, or her young are too numerous; in\r\neither of which cases they must be fed from the first. When the young\r\npigs are about a fortnight old, warm milk should be given to them. In\r\nanother week, this may be thickened with some species of farina; and\r\nafterward, as they gain strength and increase in size, boiled roots and\r\nvegetables may be added. As soon as they begin to eat, an open frame or\r\nrailing should be placed in the sty under which the little pigs can run,\r\nand on the other side of this should be the small troughs containing\r\ntheir food; for it never answers to let them eat out of the same trough\r\nwith their mother, because the food set before her is generally too\r\nstrong and stimulating for them, even if they should secure any of it,\r\nwhich is, to say the least, extremely doubtful. Those intended to be\r\nkilled for sucking-pigs should not be above four weeks old; most kill\r\nthem for this purpose on the twenty-first or twenty-second day. The\r\nothers, excepting those kept for breeding, should be castrated at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION AND SPAYING.\r\n\r\nPigs are chiefly castrated with a view to fattening them; and,\r\ndoubtless, this operation has the desired effect--for at the same time\r\nthat it increases the quiescent qualities of the animal, it diminishes\r\nalso his courage, spirits, and nobler attributes, and even affects his\r\nform. The tusks of a castrated boar never grow like those of the natural\r\nanimal, but always have a dwarfed, stunted appearance. The operation, if\r\npossible, should be performed in the spring or autumn, as the\r\ntemperature is the more uniform, and care should be taken that the\r\nanimal is in perfect health. Those which are fat and plethoric should be\r\nprepared by bleeding, cooling diet and quiet. Pigs are castrated at all\r\nages, from a fortnight to three, six and eight weeks, and even four\r\nmonths old.\r\n\r\nThere are various modes of performing this operation. If the pig is not\r\nmore than six weeks old, an incision is made at the bottom of the\r\nscrotum, the testicle pushed out, and the cord cut, without any\r\nprecautionary means whatever. When the animal is older, there is reason\r\nto fear that hemorrhage, to a greater or less extent, will supervene;\r\nconsequently, it will be advisable to pass a ligature round the cord a\r\nlittle above the spot where the division is to take place.\r\n\r\nBy another mode--to be practised only on very young animals--a portion\r\nof the base of the scrotum is cut off, the testicles forced out, and the\r\ncord sawn through with a somewhat serrated but blunt instrument. If\r\nthere is any hemorrhage, it is arrested by putting ashes in the wound.\r\nThe animal is then dismissed and nothing further done with him.\r\n\r\nOn animals two and three years old, the operation is some times\r\nperformed in the following manner: An assistant holds the pig, pressing\r\nthe back of the animal against his chest and belly, keeping the head\r\nelevated, and grasping all the four legs together; or, which is the\r\npreferable way, one assistant holds the animal against his chest, while\r\nanother kneels down and secures the four legs. The operator then grasps\r\nthe scrotum with his left hand, makes one horizontal incision across its\r\nbase, opening both divisions of the bag at the same time. The testicles\r\nare then pressed out with his finger and thumb, and removed with a blunt\r\nknife, which lacerates the part without bruising it and rendering it\r\npainful. Laceration only is requisite in order to prevent the subsequent\r\nhemorrhage which would occur, if the cord were simply severed by a sharp\r\ninstrument. The wound is then closed by pushing the edges gently\r\ntogether with the fingers, and it speedily heals. Some break the\r\nspermatic cord without tearing it; they twist it, and then pull it\r\ngently and finally until it gives way.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, a waxed cord is passed as tightly as possible round the\r\nscrotum, above the epididymus, which completely stops the circulation,\r\nand in a few days the scrotum and testicles will drop off. This\r\noperation should never be performed on pigs of more than six weeks of\r\nage, and the spermatic should always, first of all, be measured. It,\r\nmoreover requires great nicety and skill; otherwise, accidents will\r\noccur, and considerable pain and inflammation be caused. Too thick a\r\ncord, a knot not tied sufficiently tight, or a portion of the testicle\r\nincluded in the ligature, will prevent its success.\r\n\r\nThe most fatal consequence of castration is tetanus, or lockjaw, induced\r\nby the shock communicated to the nervous system by the torture of the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAYING.\r\n\r\nThis operation consists in removing the ovaries, and sometimes a portion\r\nof the uterus, more or less considerable, of the female. The animal is\r\nlaid upon its left side, and firmly held by one or two assistants; an\r\nincision is then made into the flank, the forefinger of the right hand\r\nintroduced into it, and gently moved about until it encounters and hooks\r\nhold of the right ovary, which it draws through the opening; a ligature\r\nis then passed round this one, and the left ovary felt for in like\r\nmanner. The operator then severs these two ovaries, either by cutting or\r\ntearing, and returns the womb and its appurtenances to their proper\r\nposition. This being done, he closes the wound with two or three\r\nstitches, sometimes rubs a little oil over it, and releases the animal.\r\nAll goes on well, for the healing power of the pig is very great.\r\n\r\nThe after-treatment is very simple. The animals should be well littered\r\nwith clean straw, in styes weather-tight and thoroughly ventilated;\r\ntheir diet should be cared for; some milk or whey, with barley-meal is\r\nan excellent article; it is well to confine them for a few days, as they\r\nshould be prevented from getting into cold water or mud until the wound\r\nis perfectly healed, and also from creeping through fences.\r\n\r\nThe best age for spaying a sow is about six weeks; indeed, as a general\r\nrule, the younger the animal is when either operation is performed the\r\nquicker it recovers. Some persons, however, have two or three litters\r\nfrom their sows before they operate upon them; where this is the case,\r\nthe result is more to be feared, as the parts have become more\r\nsusceptible, and are, consequently, more liable to take on inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEANING.\r\n\r\nSome farmers wean the pigs a few hours after birth, and turn the sow at\r\nonce to the boar. The best mode, however, is to turn the boar into the\r\nhog-yard about a week after parturition, at which time the sow should be\r\nremoved a few hours daily from her young. It does not injure either the\r\nsow or her pigs if she takes the boar while suckling; but some sows will\r\nnot do so until the drying of their milk.\r\n\r\nThe age at which pigs may be weaned to the greatest advantage is when\r\nthey are about eight or ten weeks old; many, however, wean them as early\r\nas six weeks, but they seldom turn out as well. They should not be taken\r\nfrom the sow at once, but gradually weaned. At first they should be\r\nremoved from her for a certain number of hours each day, and accustomed\r\nto be impelled by hunger to eat from the trough; then they may be turned\r\nout for an hour without her, and afterwards shut up while she also is\r\nturned out by herself. Subsequently, they must only be allowed to suck a\r\ncertain number of times in twenty-four hours; perhaps six times at\r\nfirst, then four, then three, and, at last, only once; and meanwhile\r\nthey must be proportionably better and more plentifully fed, and the\r\nmother's diet in a like manner diminished. Some advise that the whole\r\nlitter should be weaned at once; this is not best, unless one or two of\r\nthe pigs are much weaker and smaller than the others; in such case, if\r\nthe sow remain in tolerable condition, they might be suffered to suck\r\nfor a week longer; but this should be the exception, and not a general\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nPigs are more easily weaned than almost any other animals, because they\r\nlearn to feed sooner; but attention must, nevertheless, be paid to them,\r\nif they are to grow up strong, healthy animals. Their styes must be\r\nwarm, dry, clean, well-ventilated, and weather-tight. They should have\r\nthe run of a grass meadow or enclosure for an hour or two every fine\r\nday, in spring and summer, or be turned into the farm-yard among the\r\ncattle in the winter, as fresh air and exercise tend to prevent them\r\nfrom becoming rickety or crooked in the legs.\r\n\r\nThe most nutritious and succulent food that circumstances will permit\r\nshould be furnished them. Newly-weaned pigs require five or six meals in\r\nthe twenty-four hours. In about ten days, one may be omitted; in another\r\nweek, a second; and then they should do with three _regular_ meals each\r\nday. A little sulphur mingled with the food, or a small quantity of\r\nEpsom or Glauber salts dissolved in the water, will frequently prove\r\nbeneficial. A plentiful supply of clear, cold water should always be\r\nwithin their reach; the food left in the trough after the animals have\r\nfinished eating should be removed, and the trough thoroughly rinsed out\r\nbefore any more is put into it. Strict attention should also be paid to\r\ncleanliness. The boars and sows should be kept apart from the period of\r\nweaning.\r\n\r\nThe question, which is more profitable, to breed swine, or to buy young\r\npigs and fatten them, can best be determined by those interested; since\r\nthey know best what resources they can command, and what chance of\r\nprofits each of these separate branches offers.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINGING.\r\n\r\nThis operation is performed to counteract the propensity which swine\r\nhave of digging and furrowing up the earth. The ring is passed through\r\nwhat appears to be a prolongation of the septum, between the\r\nsupplemental, or snout-bone, and the nasal. The animal is thus unable to\r\nobtain sufficient purchase to use his snout with any effect, without\r\ncausing the ring to press so painfully upon the part that he is forced\r\nto desist. The ring, however, is apt to break, or it wears out in\r\nprocess of time, and has to be replaced.\r\n\r\nThe snout should be perforated at weaning-time, after the animal has\r\nrecovered from castration or spaying; and it will be necessary to renew\r\nthe operation as it becomes of large growth. It is too generally\r\nneglected at first; but no pigs, young or old, should be suffered to run\r\nat large without this precaution. The sow's ring should be ascertained\r\nto be of sufficient strength previously to her taking the boar, on\r\naccount of the risk of abortion, if the operation is renewed while she\r\nis with pig. Care must be taken by the operator not to go too close to\r\nthe bone, and that the ring turn easily.\r\n\r\nA far better mode of proceeding is, when the pig is young, to cut\r\nthrough the cartilaginous and ligamentous prolongations, by which the\r\nsupplementary bone is united to the proper nasals. The divided edges of\r\nthe cartilage will never re-unite, and the snout always remains\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING AND FATTENING.\r\n\r\nRoots and fruits are the natural food of the hog, in a wild as well as\r\nin a domesticated state; and it is evident that, however omnivorous it\r\nmay occasionally appear, its palate is by no means insensible to the\r\ndifference in eatables, since, whenever it finds variety, it will select\r\nthe best with as much cleverness as other quadrupeds. Indeed, the hog is\r\nmore nice in the selection of his vegetable diet than any of the other\r\ndomesticated herbivorous animals. To a certain extent he is omnivorous,\r\nand may be reared on the refuse of slaughter-houses; but such food is\r\nnot wholesome, nor is it natural; for, though he is omnivorous, he is\r\nnot essentially carnivorous. The refuse of the dairy-farm is more\r\ncongenial to his health, to say nothing of the quality of its flesh.\r\n\r\nSwine are generally fattened for pork at from six to nine months old;\r\nand for bacon, at from a year to two years. Eighteen months is generally\r\nconsidered the proper age for a good bacon hog. The feeding will always,\r\nin a great measure, depend upon the circumstances of the owner--upon the\r\nkind of food which he has at his disposal, and can best spare--and the\r\npurpose for which the animal is intended. It will also, in some degree,\r\nbe regulated by the season; it being possible to feed pigs very\r\ndifferently in the summer from what they are fed in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe refuse wash and grains, and other residue of breweries and\r\ndistilleries, may be given to swine with advantage, and seem to induce a\r\ntendency to lay on flesh. They should not, however, be given in too\r\nlarge quantities, nor unmixed with other and more substantial food;\r\nsince, although they give flesh rapidly when fed on it, the meat is not\r\nfirm, and never makes good bacon. Hogs eat acorns and beech-mast\r\ngreedily, and so far thrive on this food that it is an easy matter to\r\nfatten them afterwards. Apples and pumpkins are likewise valuable for\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing so nutritious, so eminently and in every way adapted\r\nfor the purpose of fattening, as are the various kinds of grain--nothing\r\nthat tends more to create firmness as well as delicacy in the flesh.\r\nIndian corn is equal, if not superior, to any kind of grain for\r\nfattening purposes, and can be given in its natural state, as pigs are\r\nso fond of it that they will eat up every kernel. The pork and bacon of\r\nanimals that have been thus fed are peculiarly firm and solid. Animal\r\nfood tends to make swine savage and feverish, and often lays the\r\nfoundation of serious inflammation of the intestines. Weekly washing\r\nwith soap and a brush adds wonderfully to the thriving condition of a\r\nhog.\r\n\r\nIn the rich corn regions of our States, upon that grain beginning to\r\nripen, as it does in August, the fields are fenced off into suitable\r\nlots, and large herds are successively turned into them, to consume the\r\ngrain at their leisure. They waste nothing except the stalks, which in\r\nthat land of plenty are considered of little value, and they are still\r\nuseful as manure for succeeding crops; and whatever grain is left by\r\nthem, leaner droves which follow will readily glean. Peas, early\r\nbuckwheat, and apples, may be fed on the ground in the same way.\r\n\r\nThere is an improvement in the character of the grain from a few months'\r\nkeeping, which is fully equivalent to the interest of the money and the\r\ncost of storage. If fattened early in the season, hogs will consume less\r\nfood to make an equal amount of flesh than in colder weather; they will\r\nrequire less attention; and, generally, early pork will command the\r\nhighest price in market.\r\n\r\nIt is most economical to provide swine with a fine clover pasture, to\r\nrun in during the spring and summer; and they ought also to have access\r\nto the orchard, to pick up all the unripe and superfluous fruit that\r\nfalls. They should also have the wash of the house and the dairy, to\r\nwhich add meal, and let it sour in large tubs or barrels. Not less than\r\none-third, and perhaps more, of the whole grain fed to hogs, is saved by\r\ngrinding and cooking, or souring. Care must, however, be taken that the\r\nsouring be not carried so far as to injure the food by putrefaction. A\r\nmixture of meal and water, with the addition of yeast or such remains of\r\na former fermentation as adhere to the sides or bottom of the vessel,\r\nand exposure to a temperature between sixty-eight and seventy-seven\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, will produce immediate fermentation.\r\n\r\nIn this process there are five stages: the _saccharine_, by which the\r\nstarch and gum of the vegetables, in their natural condition, are\r\nconverted into sugar; the _vinous_, which changes the sugar into\r\nalcohol; the _mucilaginous_, sometimes taking the place of the vinous,\r\nand occurring where the sugar solution, or fermenting principle, is\r\nweak, producing a slimy, glutinous product; the _acetic_, forming\r\nvinegar, from the vinous or alcoholic stage; and the _putrefactive_,\r\nwhich destroys all the nutritive principles and converts them into a\r\npoison. The precise points in fermentation, when the food becomes most\r\nprofitable for feeding, has not as yet been satisfactorily determined;\r\nbut that it should stop short of the putrefactive, and probably the full\r\nmaturity of the acetic, is certain.\r\n\r\nThe roots for fattening ought to be washed, and steamed or boiled; and\r\nwhen not intended to be fermented, the meal may be scalded with the\r\nroots. A small quantity of salt should be added. Potatoes are the best\r\nroots for swine; then parsnips; orange or red carrots, white or Belgian;\r\nsugar-beets; mangel-wurtzels; ruta-bagas; and then white turnips, in the\r\norder mentioned. The nutritive properties of turnips are diffused\r\nthrough so large a bulk that it is doubtful if they can ever be fed to\r\nfattening swine with advantage; and they will barely sustain life when\r\nfed to them uncooked.\r\n\r\nThere is a great loss in feeding roots to fattening swine, without\r\ncooking. When unprepared grain is fed, it should be on a full stomach,\r\nto prevent imperfect mastication, and consequent loss of the food. It is\r\nbetter, indeed, to have it always before them. The animal machine is an\r\nexpensive one to keep in motion; and it should be the object of the\r\nfarmer to put his food in the most available condition for its immediate\r\nconversion into fat and muscle.\r\n\r\nThe following injunctions should be rigidly observed, if one would\r\nsecure the greatest results:\r\n\r\n1. Avoid _foul feeding_.\r\n\r\n2. Do not omit adding _salt_ in moderate quantities to the mess given.\r\n\r\n3. Feed at _regular intervals_.\r\n\r\n4. _Cleanse_ the troughs previous to feeding.\r\n\r\n5. Do not _over-feed_; give only as much as will be consumed at the\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\n6. _Vary_ the food. Variety will create, or, at all events, increase\r\nappetite, and it is most conducive to health. Let the variations be\r\ngoverned by the condition of the _dung_ cast, which should be of a\r\nmedium consistence, and of a grayish-brown color; if _hard_, increase\r\nthe quantity of bran and succulent roots; if too _liquid_, diminish, or\r\ndispense with bran, and make the mess firmer; add a portion of corn.\r\n\r\n7. Feed the stock _separately_, in classes, according to their relative\r\nconditions. Keep sows with young by themselves; store-hogs by\r\nthemselves; and bacon-hogs and porkers by themselves. It is not\r\nadvisable to keep the store-hogs too high in flesh, since high feeding\r\nis calculated to retard development of form and bulk. It is better to\r\nfeed pigs intended to be put up for bacon _loosely_ and not too\r\nabundantly, until they have attained their full stature; they can then\r\nbe brought into the highest possible condition in a surprisingly short\r\nspace of time.\r\n\r\n8. Keep the swine _clean_, dry, and warm. Cleanliness, dryness, and\r\nwarmth are _essential_, and as imperative as feeding; for an inferior\r\ndescription of food will, by their aid, succeed far better than the\r\nhighest feeding will without them.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGGERIES.\r\n\r\nFew items conduce more to the thriving and well-being of swine than\r\nairy, spacious, well-constructed styes, and above all, cleanliness.\r\nThey were formerly too often housed in damp, dirty, close, and\r\nimperfectly-built sheds, which was a fruitful source of disease and of\r\nunthrifty animals. Any place was once thought good enough to keep a pig\r\nin.\r\n\r\nIn large establishments, where numerous pigs are kept, there should be\r\ndivisions appropriated to all the different kinds; the boars, the\r\nbreeding sows, the newly weaned, and the fattening pigs should all be\r\nkept separate; and in the divisions assigned to the second and last of\r\nthese classes, it is best to have a distinct apartment for each animal,\r\nall opening into a yard or inclosure of limited extent. As pigs require\r\nwarmth, these buildings should face the south, and be kept weather-tight\r\nand well drained. Good ventilation is also important; for it is idle to\r\nexpect animals to make good flesh and retain their health, unless they\r\nhave a sufficiency of pure air. The blood requires this to give it\r\nvitality and free it from impurities, as much as the stomach requires\r\nwholesome and strengthening food; and when it does not have it, it\r\nbecomes vitiated, and impairs all the animal functions. Bad smells and\r\nexhalations, moreover, injure the flavor of the meat.\r\n\r\nDamp and cold floors should be guarded against, as they tend to induce\r\ncramp and diarrh[oe]a; and the roof should be so contrived as to carry\r\noff the wet from the pigs. The walls of a well-constructed sty should be\r\nof solid masonry; the roof sloping, and furnished with spouts to carry\r\noff the rain; the floors either slightly inclined toward a gutter made\r\nto carry off the rain, or else raised from the ground on beams or\r\njoists, and perforated so that all urine and moisture shall drain off.\r\nBricks and tiles, sometimes used for flooring, are objectionable,\r\nbecause, however well covered with straw, they still strike cold. Wood\r\nis far superior in this respect, as well as because it admits of those\r\nclefts or perforations being made, which serve not only to drain off all\r\nmoisture, but also to admit fresh air.\r\n\r\nThe manure proceeding from the pig-sty has often been much undervalued,\r\nand for this reason, that the litter is supposed to form the principal\r\nportion of it; whereas it constitutes the least valuable part, and,\r\nindeed, it can scarcely be regarded as manure at all--at least by\r\nitself--where the requisite attention is paid to the cleanliness of the\r\nanimals and of their dwellings. The urine and the dung are valuable,\r\nbeing, from the very nature of the food of the animals, exceedingly rich\r\nand oleaginous, and materially beneficial to cold soils and grass-lands.\r\nThe manure from the sty should always be collected as carefully as that\r\nfrom the stable or cow-house, and husbanded in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe door of each sty ought to be so hung that it will open inward or\r\noutward, so as to give the animals free ingress and egress. For this\r\npurpose, it should be hung across from side to side, and the animal can\r\npush it up to effect its entry or exit; for, if it were hung in the\r\nordinary way, it would derange the litter every time it opened inward,\r\nand be very liable to hitch. If it is not intended that the pigs shall\r\nleave their sty, there should be an upper and lower door; the former of\r\nwhich should always be left open when the weather is warm and dry, while\r\nthe latter will serve to confine the animal. There should likewise be\r\nwindows or slides, which can be opened or closed at will, to give\r\nadmission to the fresh air, or exclude rain or cold.\r\n\r\nWherever it can be managed, the troughs--which should be of stone or\r\ncast metal, since wooden ones will soon be gnawed to pieces--should be\r\nso situated that they can be filled and cleaned from the outside,\r\nwithout interfering with or disturbing the animals at all; and for this\r\npurpose it is well to have a flap, or door, with swinging hinges, made\r\nto hang horizontally on the trough, so that it can be moved to and fro,\r\nand alternately be fastened by a bolt to the inside or outside of the\r\nmanger. When the hogs have fed sufficiently, the door is swung inward\r\nand fastened, and so remains until feeding-time, when the trough is\r\ncleansed and refilled without any trouble, and then the flap drawn back,\r\nand the animals admitted to their food. Some cover the trough with a lid\r\nhaving as many holes in it as there are pigs to eat from it, which gives\r\neach pig an opportunity of selecting his own hole, and eating away\r\nwithout interfering with or incommoding his neighbor.\r\n\r\nA hog ought to have three apartments, one each for sleeping, eating, and\r\nevacuations; of which the last may occupy the lowest, and the first the\r\nhighest level, so that nothing shall be drained, and as little carried\r\ninto the first two as possible. The piggery should always be built as\r\nnear as possible to that portion of the establishment from which the\r\nchief part of the provision is to come, since much labor will thus be\r\nsaved. Washings, and combings, and brushings, as has been previously\r\nsuggested, are valuable adjuncts in the treatment of swine; the energies\r\nof the skin are thus roused, the pores opened, the healthful functions\r\naided, and that inertness, so likely to be engendered by the lazy life\r\nof a fattening pig, counteracted.\r\n\r\nA supply of fresh water is essential to the well-being of swine, and\r\nshould be freely furnished. If a stream can be brought through the\r\npiggery, it answers better than any thing else. Swine are dirty feeders\r\nand dirty drinkers, usually plunging their fore-feet into the trough or\r\npail, and thus polluting with mud or dirt whatever may be given to them.\r\nOne of the advantages, therefore, to be derived from the stream of\r\nrunning water is, its being kept constantly clean and wholesome by its\r\nrunning. If this advantage cannot be procured, it is desirable to\r\npresent water in vessels of a size to receive but one head at a time,\r\nand of such height as to render it impossible, or difficult, for the\r\ndrinker to get his feet into it. The water should be renewed twice\r\ndaily. If swine are closely confined in pens, they should have as much\r\ncharcoal twice a week as they will eat, for the purpose of correcting\r\nany tendency to disorders of the stomach. Rotten wood is an imperfect\r\nsubstitute for charcoal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTERING.\r\n\r\nA pig that is to be killed should be kept without food for from twelve\r\nto sixteen hours previous to slaughtering; a little water must, however,\r\nbe within his reach. He should, in the first place, be stunned by a blow\r\non the head. Some advise that the knife should be thrust into the neck\r\nso as to sever the artery leading from the heart; while others prefer\r\nthat the animal should be stuck through the brisket in the direction of\r\nthe heart--care being exercised not to touch the first rib. The blood\r\nshould then be allowed to drain from the carcass into vessels placed for\r\nthe purpose; and the more completely it does so, the better will be the\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nA large tub, or other vessel, has been previously got ready, which is\r\nnow filled with boiling water. The carcass of the hog is plunged into\r\nthis, and the hair is then removed with the edge of a knife. The hair is\r\nmore easily removed if the hog is scalded before he stiffens, or becomes\r\nquite cold. It is not, however, necessary, but simply brutal and\r\nbarbarous, to scald him while there is yet some life in him. Bacon-hogs\r\nmay be singed, by enveloping the body in straw, and setting the straw on\r\nfire, and then scraping it all over. When this is done, care must be\r\nobserved not to burn or parch the cuticle. The entrails should then be\r\nremoved, and the interior of the body well washed with lukewarm water,\r\nso as to remove all blood and impurities, and afterward wiped dry with a\r\nclean cloth; the carcass should then be hung up in a cool place for\r\neighteen or twenty hours, to become set and firm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OLD ENGLISH HOG.]\r\n\r\nFor cutting up, the carcass should be laid on the back, upon a strong\r\ntable. The head should then be cut off close by the ears, and the\r\nhinder feet so far below the houghs as not to disfigure the hams, and\r\nleave room sufficient for hanging them up; after which the carcass is\r\ndivided into equal halves, up the middle of the back bone, with a\r\ncleaving-knife, and, if necessary, a hand-mallet. Then cut the ham from\r\nthe side by the second joint of the back-bone, which will appear on\r\ndividing the carcass, and dress the ham by paring a little off the\r\nflank, or skinny part, so as to shape it with a half round point,\r\nclearing off any top fat which may appear. Next cut off the sharp edge\r\nalong the back bone with a knife and mallet, and slice off the first rib\r\nnext the shoulder, where there is a bloody vein, which must be taken\r\nout, since, if it is left in, that part is apt to spoil. The corners\r\nshould be squared off when the ham is cut. The ordinary practice is to\r\ncut out the spine, or back bone. Some take out the chine and upper parts\r\nof the ribs in the first place; indeed, almost every locality has its\r\npeculiar mode of proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLING AND CURING.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of curing is to pack the pork in clean salt, adding\r\nbrine to the barrel when filled. But it may be dry-salted, by rubbing it\r\nin thoroughly on every side of each piece, with a strong leather rubber\r\nfirmly secured to the palm of the right hand. The pieces are then thrown\r\ninto heaps and sprinkled with salt, and occasionally turned till cured;\r\nor it may at once be packed in dry casks, which are rolled at times to\r\nbring the salt into contact with every part.\r\n\r\nHams and shoulders may be cured in the same manner either dry or in\r\npickle, but with differently arranged materials. The following is a\r\ngood pickle for two hundred pounds: Take fourteen pounds of Turk's\r\nIsland salt; one-half pound of saltpetre; two quarts of molasses, or\r\nfour pounds of brown sugar; with water enough to dissolve them. Bring\r\nthe liquor to the scalding-point, and skim off all the impurities which\r\nrise to the top. When cold, pour it upon the ham, which should be\r\nperfectly cool, but not frozen, and closely packed; if not sufficient to\r\ncover it, add pure water for this purpose. Some extensive packers of\r\nchoice hams add pepper, allspice, cinnamon, nutmegs, or mace and cloves.\r\n\r\nThe hams may remain six or eight weeks in this pickle, then should be\r\nhung up in the smoke-house, with the small end down, and smoked from ten\r\nto twenty days, according to the quantity of smoke. The fire should not\r\nbe near enough to heat the hams. In Holland and Westphalia, the fire is\r\nmade in the cellar, and the smoke carried by a flue into a cool, dry\r\nchamber. This is, undoubtedly, the best mode of smoking. The hams should\r\nat all times be dry and cool, or their flavor will suffer. Green\r\nsugar-maple chips are best for smoke; next to them are hickory, sweet\r\nbirch, corn-cobs, white ash, or beech.\r\n\r\nThe smoke-house is the best place in which to keep hams until they are\r\nwanted. If removed, they should be kept cool, dry, and free from flies.\r\nA canvas cover for each, saturated with lime, which may be put on with a\r\nwhitewash brush, is a perfect protection against flies. When not to be\r\nkept long, they may be packed in dry salt, or even in sweet brine,\r\nwithout injury. A common method is to pack in dry oats, baked saw-dust,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe following is the method in most general use in several of the\r\nWestern States. The chine is taken out, as also the spare-ribs from\r\nthe shoulders, and the mouse-pieces and short-ribs, or griskins,\r\nfrom the middlings. No acute angles should be left to shoulders or\r\nhams. In salting up, all the meat, except the heads, joints, and\r\nchines, and smaller pieces, is put into powdering-tubs--water-tight\r\nhalf-hogsheads--or into large troughs, ten feet long and three or four\r\nfeet wide at the top, made of the poplar tree. The latter are much more\r\nconvenient for packing the meat in, and are easily caulked, if they\r\nshould crack so as to leak. The salting-tray--or box in which the meat\r\nis to be salted, piece by piece, and from which each piece, as it is\r\nsalted, is to be transferred to the powdering-tub, or trough--must be\r\nplaced just so near the trough that the man standing between can\r\ntransfer the pieces from one to the other easily, and without wasting\r\nthe salt as they are lifted from the salting-box into the trough. The\r\nsalter stands on the off-side of the salting-box. The hams should be\r\nsalted first, the shoulders next, and the middlings last, which may be\r\npiled up two feet above the top of the trough or tub. The joints will\r\nthus in a short time be immersed in brine.\r\n\r\nMeasure into the salting-tray four measures of salt--a peck measure will\r\nbe found most convenient--and one measure of clean, dry, sifted ashes;\r\nmix, and incorporate them well. The salter takes a ham into the tray,\r\nrubs the skin, and the raw end with his composition, turns it over, and\r\npacks the composition of salt and ashes on the fleshy side till it is at\r\nleast three-quarters of an inch deep all over it; and on the interior\r\nlower part of the ham, which is covered with the skin, as much as will\r\nlie on it. The man standing ready to transfer the pieces, deposits it\r\ncarefully, without disturbing the composition, with the skin-side down,\r\nin the bottom of the trough. Each succeeding ham is then deposited, side\r\nby side, so as to leave the least possible space unoccupied.\r\n\r\nWhen the bottom is wholly covered, see that every visible part of this\r\nlayer of meat is covered with the composition of salt and ashes. Then\r\nbegin another layer, every piece being covered on the upper or fleshy\r\nside three-quarters of an inch thick with the composition. When the\r\ntrough is filled, even full, in this way, with the joints, salt the\r\nmiddlings with salt only, without the ashes, and pile them up on the\r\njoints so that the liquified salt may pass from them into the trough.\r\nHeads, joints, back bones, etc., receive salt only, and should not be\r\nput in the trough with the large pieces.\r\n\r\nMuch slighter salting will preserve them, if they are salted upon loose\r\nboards, so that the bloody brine from them can pass off. The joints and\r\nmiddlings are to remain in and above the trough without being\r\nre-handled, re-salted, or disturbed in any way, till they are to be hung\r\nup to be smoked.\r\n\r\nIf the hogs do not weigh more than one hundred and fifty pounds, the\r\njoints need not remain longer than five weeks in the pickle; if they\r\nweigh two hundred, or upward, six or seven weeks are not too long. It is\r\nbetter that they should stay in too long, rather than too short a time.\r\n\r\nIn three weeks, the joints, etc., may be hung up. Taking out of pickle,\r\nand preparing for hanging up to smoke, are thus performed: Scrape off\r\nthe undissolved salt; if the directions have been followed, there will\r\nbe a considerable quantity on all the pieces not immersed in the brine;\r\nthis salt and the brine are all saved; the brine is boiled down, and the\r\ndry composition given to stock, especially to hogs. Wash every piece in\r\nlukewarm water, and with a rough towel clean off the salt and ashes.\r\nNext, put the strings in to hang up. Set the pieces up edgewise, that\r\nthey may drain and dry. Every piece is then to be dipped into the\r\nmeat-paint, as it is termed, composed of warm--not hot--water and very\r\nfine ashes, stirred together until they are of the consistence of thick\r\npaint, and hang up to smoke. By being thus dipped, they receive a\r\ncoating which protects them from the fly, prevents dripping, and tends\r\nto lessen all external injurious influences. Hang up the pieces while\r\nyet moist with the paint, and smoke them well.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF THE CARCASS.\r\n\r\nNo part of the hog is valueless, excepting, perhaps, the bristles of the\r\nfine-bred races. The very intestines are cleansed, and knotted into\r\nchittarlings, very much relished by some; the blood, mixed with fat and\r\nrice, is made into black puddings; and the tender muscle under the\r\nlumbar vertebrae is worked up into sausages, sweet, high-flavored, and\r\ndelicious; the skin, roasted, is a rare and toothsome morsel; and a\r\nroast sucking-pig is a general delight; salt pork and bacon are in\r\nincessant demand, and form important articles of commerce.\r\n\r\nOne great value arises from the peculiarity of its fat, which, in\r\ncontradistinction to that of the ox or of the sheep, is termed _lard_,\r\nand differs from either in the proportion of its constituent principles,\r\nwhich are essentially oleine and stearine. It is rendered, or fried out,\r\nin the same manner as mutton-suet. It melts completely at ninety-nine\r\ndegrees Fahrenheit, and then has the appearance of a transparent and\r\nnearly colorless fixed oil. Eighty degrees is the melting-point. It\r\nconsists of sixty-two parts oleine, and thirty-eight of stearine, out of\r\none hundred. When subjected to pressure between folds of blotting-paper,\r\nthe oleine is absorbed, while the stearine remains. For domestic\r\npurposes, lard is much used: it is much better than butter for frying\r\nfish; and is much used in pastry, on the score of economy.\r\n\r\nThe stearine contains the stearic and margaric acids, which, when\r\nseparated, are solid, and used as inferior substitutes for wax or\r\nspermaceti candles. The other, oleine, is fluid at a low temperature,\r\nand in American commerce is known as _lard-oil_, which is very pure, and\r\nextensively used for machinery, lamps, and most of the purposes for\r\nwhich olive or spermaceti oils are valued. It has given to pork a new\r\nand profitable use, by which the value of the carcass is greatly\r\nincreased. A large amount of pork has thus been withdrawn from the\r\nmarket, and the depression, which must otherwise have occurred, has been\r\nthereby prevented.\r\n\r\nWhere the oil is required, the whole carcass, after taking out the hams\r\nand shoulders, is placed in a tub having two bottoms, the upper one\r\nperforated with holes. The pork is laid on the latter, and then tightly\r\ncovered. Steam, at a high temperature, is then admitted into the tub,\r\nand in a short time all the fat is extracted, and falls upon the lower\r\nbottom. The remaining mass is bones and scraps. The last is fed to pigs,\r\npoultry, or dogs, or affords the best kind of manure. The bones are\r\neither used for manure, or are converted into animal charcoal, valuable\r\nfor various purposes in the arts. When the object is to obtain lard of a\r\nfine quality, the animal is first skinned, and the adhering fat then\r\ncarefully scraped off; thus avoiding the oily, viscid matter of the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThe _bristles_ of the coarse breeds are long, strong, firm, and elastic.\r\nThese are formed into brushes for painters and artists, as well as for\r\nnumerous domestic uses. The _skin_, when tanned, is of a peculiar\r\ntexture, and very tough. It is used for making pocket-books, and for\r\nsome ornamental purposes; but chiefly for the seats of riding-saddles.\r\nThe numerous little variegations on it, which constitute its beauty, are\r\nthe orifices whence the bristles have been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND THEIR REMEDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nBy reason of being generally considered a subordinate species of stock,\r\nswine do not, in many cases, share in the benefits which an improved\r\nsystem of agriculture and the present advanced state of veterinary\r\nscience, have conferred upon other domesticated animals. Since they are\r\nby no means the most tractable of patients, it is any thing but an easy\r\nmatter to compel them to swallow any thing to which their appetite does\r\nnot incite them; and, hence, prevention will be found better than cure.\r\n_Cleanliness_ is the great point to be insisted upon in the management\r\nof these animals. If this, and warmth, be only attended to, ailments\r\namong them are comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nAs, however, disappointment may occasionally occur, even under the best\r\nsystem of management, a brief view of the principal complaints with\r\nwhich they are liable to be attacked is presented, together with the\r\nbest mode of treatment to be adopted in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATCHING THE PIG.\r\n\r\nSwine are very difficult animals to obtain any mastery over, or to\r\noperate on, or examine. Seldom tame, or easily handled, they are at such\r\nperiods most unmanageable--kicking, screaming, and even biting fiercely.\r\nThe following method of getting hold of them has been recommended:\r\nFasten a double cord to the end of a stick, and beneath the stick let\r\nthere be a running noose in the cord; tie a piece of bread to the cord,\r\nand present it to the animal; and when he opens his mouth to seize the\r\nbait, catch the upper jaw in the noose, run it tight, and the animal is\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nAnother method is, to catch one foot in a running noose suspended from\r\nsome place, so as to draw the imprisoned foot off the ground; or, to\r\nenvelop the head of the animal in a cloth or sack.\r\n\r\nAll coercive measures, however, should, as far as possible, be avoided;\r\nfor the pig is naturally so averse to being handled that in his\r\nstruggles he will often do himself far more mischief than the disease\r\nwhich is to be investigated or remedied would effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING.\r\n\r\nThe common mode of drawing blood from the pig is by cutting off portions\r\nof the ears or tail; this should only be resorted to when local and\r\ninstant blood-letting is requisite. The jugular veins of swine lie too\r\ndeep, and are too much imbedded in fat to admit of their being raised by\r\nany ligature about the neck; it is, therefore, useless to attempt to\r\npuncture them, as it would only be striking at random.\r\n\r\nThose veins, however, which run over the interior surface of the ear,\r\nand especially toward its outer edge, may be opened without much\r\ndifficulty; if the ear is turned back on the poll, one or more of them\r\nmay easily be made sufficiently prominent to admit of its being\r\npunctured by pressing the fingers on the base of the ear, near to the\r\nconch. When the necessary quantity of blood has been obtained, the\r\nfinger may be raised, and it will cease to flow.\r\n\r\nThe palate veins, running on either side of the roof of the mouth, are\r\nalso easily opened by making two incisions, one on each side of the\r\npalate, about half way between the centre of the roof of the mouth and\r\nthe teeth. The flow of blood may be readily stopped by means of a\r\npledget of tow and a string, as in bleeding the horse.\r\n\r\nThe brachial vein of the fore-leg--commonly called the\r\nplate-vein--running along the inner side under the skin affords a good\r\nopportunity. The best place for puncturing it is about an inch above the\r\nknee, and scarcely half an inch backward from the radius, or the bone of\r\nthe fore-arm. No danger need to be apprehended from cutting two or three\r\ntimes, if sufficient blood cannot be obtained at once. This vein will\r\nbecome easily discernible if a ligature is tied firmly around the leg,\r\njust below the shoulder.\r\n\r\nThis operation should always be performed with the lancet, if possible.\r\nIn cases of urgent haste, where no lancet is at hand, a small penknife\r\nmay be used; but the fleam is a dangerous and objectionable instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRENCHING.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is possible, the medicine to be administered should be\r\nmingled with a portion of food, and the animal thus cheated or coaxed\r\ninto taking it; since many instances are on record, in which the pig has\r\nruptured some vessel in his struggles, and died on the spot, or so\r\ninjured himself as to bring on inflammation and subsequent death.\r\n\r\nWhere this cannot be done, the following is the best method: Let a man\r\nget the head of the animal firmly between his knees--without, however,\r\npinching it--while another secures the hinder parts. Then let the first\r\ntake hold of the head from below, raise it a little, and incline it\r\nslightly toward the right, at the same time separating the lips on the\r\nleft side so as to form a hole into which the fluid may be gradually\r\npoured--no more being introduced into the mouth at a time than can be\r\nswallowed at once. Should the animal snort or choke, the head must be\r\nreleased for a few moments, or he will be in danger of being strangled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH.\r\n\r\nThis ailment--an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose,\r\netc.--is, if taken in time, easily cured by opening medicines, followed\r\nup by warm bran-wash--a warm, dry sty--and abstinence from rich grains,\r\nor stimulating, farinaceous diet. The cause, in most cases, is exposure\r\nto drafts of air, which should be guarded against.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOLERA.\r\n\r\nFor what is presented concerning this disease, the author is indebted to\r\nhis friend, G. W. Bowler, V. S., of Cincinnati, Ohio, whose familiarity\r\nwith the various diseases of our domestic animals and the best modes of\r\ntreating them, entitles his opinions to great weight.\r\n\r\nThe term \"cholera\" is employed to designate a disease which has been\r\nvery fatal among swine in different parts of the United States; and for\r\nthe reason, that its symptoms, as well as the indications accompanying\r\nits termination, are very nearly allied to what is manifested in the\r\ndisease of that name which visits man.\r\n\r\nEpidemic cholera has, for several years past, committed fearful ravages\r\namong the swine of, particularly, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky. Indeed,\r\nmany farmers who, until recently, have been accustomed to raise large\r\nnumbers of these animals, are, in a great measure, disinclined to invest\r\nagain in such stock, on account of the severe losses--in some instances\r\nto the extent of the entire drove upon particular places.\r\n\r\nVarious remedies have, of course, been prescribed; but the most have\r\nfailed in nearly every case where the disease has secured a firm\r\nfoothold. Preventives are, therefore, the most that can at present be\r\nexpected; and in this direction something may be done. Although some\r\npeculiar change in the atmosphere is, probably, an impelling cause of\r\ncholera, its ravages may be somewhat stayed by removing other\r\npredisposing associate causes.\r\n\r\nGranting that the hog is a filthy animal and fond of rooting among\r\nfilth, it is by no means necessary to persist, for that reason, in\r\nsurrounding him with all the nastiness possible; for even a hog, when\r\npenned up in a filthy place, in company with a large number of other\r\nhogs--particularly when that place is improperly ventilated--is not as\r\nhealthy as when the animals are kept together in smaller numbers in a\r\nclean and well ventilated barn or pen. Look, for a moment, at a drove of\r\nhogs coming along the street, the animals all fat and ready for the\r\nknife. They have been driven several miles, and are scarcely able to\r\ncrawl along, many of them having to be carried on drays, while others\r\nhave died on the road. At last they are driven into a pen, perhaps,\r\nseveral inches deep with the manure and filth deposited there by\r\nhundreds of predecessors; every hole in the ground has become a puddle;\r\nand in such a place some one hundred or two hundred animals are piled\r\ntogether, exhausted from the drive which they have had. They lie down in\r\nthe mud; and in a short time one can see the steam beginning to rise\r\nfrom their bodies in volumes, increasing their already prostrate\r\ncondition by the consequent inhalation of the noxious gas thus thrown\r\noff from the system; the blood becomes impregnated with poison; the\r\nvarious functions of the body are thereby impaired; and disease will\r\ninevitably be developed in one form or another. Should the disease,\r\nknown as the hog cholera, prevail in the neighborhood, the chances are\r\nvery greatly in favor of their being attacked by it, and consequently\r\nperishing.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ of cholera are as follows: The animal appears to be\r\ninstantaneously deprived of energy; loss of appetite; lying down by\r\nhimself; occasionally moving about slowly, as though experiencing some\r\nslight uneasiness internally; the eyes have a very dull and sunken\r\nappearance, which increases with the disease; the evacuations are almost\r\ncontinuous, of a dark color, having a fetid odor, and containing a large\r\nquantity of bile; the extremities are cold, and soreness is evinced when\r\nthe abdomen is pressed; the pulse is quickened, and sometimes hardly\r\nperceptible, while the buccal membrane--that belonging to the\r\ncheek--presents a slight purple hue; the tongue has a furred appearance.\r\nThe evacuations continue fluid until the animal expires, which may be in\r\ntwelve hours from the first attack, or the disease may run on for\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time after death, the abdomen becomes of a dark purple\r\ncolor, and upon examination, the stomach is found to contain but a\r\nlittle fluid; the intestines are almost entirely empty, retaining a\r\nslight quantity of the dark colored matter before mentioned; the mucous\r\nmembrane of the alimentary canal exhibits considerable inflammation,\r\nwhich sometimes appears only in patches, while the other parts are\r\nfilled with dark venous blood--indicating a breaking up of the capillary\r\nvessels in such places.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ As a preventive, the following will be found valuable:\r\nFlour of sulphur, six pounds; animal charcoal, one pound; sulphate of\r\niron, six ounces; cinchona pulverized, one pound. Mix well together in a\r\nlarge mortar; afterwards give a table-spoonful to each animal, mixed\r\nwith a few potato-peelings and corn meal, three times a day. Continue\r\nthis for one week, keeping the animal at the same time in a clean, dry\r\nplace, and not allowing too many together.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRACKINGS.\r\n\r\nThese will sometimes appear on the skin of a hog, especially about the\r\nroot of the ears and of the tail, and at the flanks. They are not at all\r\nto be confounded with mange, as they never result from any thing but\r\nexposure to extremes of temperature, while the animal is unable to avail\r\nhimself of such protection as, in a state of nature, instinct would have\r\ninduced him to adopt. They are peculiarly troublesome in the heat of\r\nsummer, if he does not have access to water, in which to lave his\r\nparched limbs and half-scorched carcass.\r\n\r\nAnoint the cracked parts twice or three times a day with tar and lard,\r\nwell melted up together.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRH[OE]A.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to stop the discharge in this disease--which, if\r\npermitted to continue unchecked, will rapidly prostrate the animal, and\r\nprobably terminate fatally--ascertain the quality of food which the\r\nanimal has recently had.\r\n\r\nIn a majority of instances, this will be found to be the cause. If taken\r\nin its incipient stage, a mere change to a more binding diet, as corn,\r\nflour, etc., will suffice for a cure. If acidity is present--produced,\r\nprobably, by the hog's having fed upon coarse, rank grasses in swampy\r\nplaces--give some chalk in the food, or powdered egg-shells, with about\r\nhalf a drachm of powdered rhubarb; the dose, of course, should vary with\r\nthe size of the animal. In the acorn season, they alone will be found\r\nsufficiently curative, where facilities for obtaining them exist. Dry\r\nlodging is indispensable; and diligence is requisite to keep it dry and\r\nclean.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVER.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ of this disease are, redness of the eyes, dryness and\r\nheat of the nostrils, the lips, and the skin generally; appetite gone,\r\nor very defective; and, generally, a very violent thirst.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNTING THE WILD BOAR.]\r\n\r\nBleed as soon as possible; after which house the animal well, taking\r\ncare, at the same time, to have the sty well and thoroughly ventilated.\r\nThe bleeding will usually be followed, in an hour or two, by such a\r\nreturn of appetite as to induce the animal to eat a sufficient quantity\r\nof food to be made the vehicle for administering external remedies. The\r\nbest is bread, steeped in broth. The hog, however, sinks so rapidly when\r\nhis appetite is near gone, that no depletive medicines are, in general,\r\nnecessary or proper; the fever will ordinarily yield to the bleeding,\r\nand the only object needs to be the support of his strength, small\r\nportions of nourishing food, administered frequently.\r\n\r\nDo not let the animal eat as much as his inclination might prompt; when\r\nhe appears to be no longer ravenous, remove the mess, and do not offer\r\nit again until after a lapse of three or four hours. If the bowels are\r\nconfined, castor and linseed oil, in equal quantities, should be added\r\nto the bread and broth, in the proportion of two to six ounces.\r\n\r\nA species of fever frequently occurs as an _epizooetic_, oftentimes\r\nattacking the male pigs, and generally the most vigorous and best\r\nlooking, without any distinction of age, and with a force and rapidity\r\nabsolutely astonishing. At other times, its progress is much slower; the\r\nsymptoms are less intense and alarming; and the veterinary surgeon,\r\nemployed at the outset, may meet with some success.\r\n\r\nThe _causes_ are, in the majority of instances, the bad styes in which\r\nthe pigs are lodged, and the noisome food which they often contain. In\r\naddition to these is the constant lying on the dung-heap, whence is\r\nexhaled a vast quantity of deleterious gas; also, the remaining far too\r\nlong on the muddy or parched ground, or too protracted exposure to the\r\nrigor of the season.\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is attacked with this disease, he should be separated\r\nfrom the others, placed in a warm situation, some stimulating ointment\r\napplied to the chest, and a decoction of sorrel administered. Frictions\r\nof vinegar should also be applied to the dorsal and lumbar region. The\r\ndrinks should be emolient, slightly imbued with nitre and vinegar, and\r\nwith aromatic fumigation about the belly.\r\n\r\nIf the fever then appears to be losing ground, which may be ascertained\r\nby the regularity of the pulse, by the absence of the plaintive cries\r\nbefore heard, by a less laborious respiration, by the absence of\r\nconvulsions, and by the non-appearance of blotches on the skin, there is\r\na fair chance of recovery. Then administer, every second hour, as before\r\ndirected, and give a proper allowance of white water, with ground barley\r\nand rye.\r\n\r\nWhen the symptoms redouble in intensity, it is best to destroy the\r\nanimal; for it is rare that, after a certain period, much chance of\r\nrecovery exists. Bleeding is seldom of much avail, but produces,\r\noccasionally, considerable loss of vital power, and augments the putrid\r\ndiathesis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUL SKIN.\r\n\r\nA simple irritability or foulness of skin will usually yield to\r\ncleanliness, and a washing with a solution of chloride of lime; but, if\r\nit is neglected for any length of time, it assumes a malignant\r\ncharacter--scabs and blotches, or red and fiery eruptions appear--and\r\nthe disease rapidly passes into mange, which will be hereafter noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS.\r\n\r\nThis disease, popularly known as heavings, is scarcely to be regarded as\r\ncurable. Were it observed in its first stage, when indicated by loss of\r\nappetite and a short, hard cough, it might, possibly, be got under by\r\ncopious bleeding, and friction with stimulating ointment on the region\r\nof the lungs; minute and frequent doses of tartar emetic should also be\r\ngiven in butter--all food of a stimulating nature carefully avoided--and\r\nthe animal kept dry and warm. If once the heavings set in, it may be\r\ncalculated with confidence that the formation of tubercles in the\r\nsubstance of the lungs has begun; and when these are formed, they are\r\nvery rarely absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe _causes_ of the disease are damp lodging, foul air, want of\r\nventilation, and unwholesome food. When tubercular formation becomes\r\nestablished, the disease may be communicated through the medium of the\r\natmosphere, the infectious influence depending upon the noxious\r\nparticles respired from the lungs of the diseased animal.\r\n\r\nThe following may be tried, though the knife is probably the best\r\nresort, if for no other reason, at least to provide against the danger\r\nof infection: Shave the hair away from the chest, and beneath each\r\nfore-leg; wet the part with spirits of turpentine, and set fire to it,\r\nhaving previously had the animal well secured, with his head well\r\nraised, and a flannel cloth at hand with which to extinguish the flame\r\nafter it has, burned a sufficient time to produce slight blisters; if\r\ncarried too far, a sore is formed, productive of no good effects, and\r\ncausing unnecessary suffering. Calomel may also be used, with a view to\r\npromote the absorption of the tubercles; but the success is\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ of this disease are, yellowness of the white of the eye;\r\na similar hue extending to the lips; and sometimes, but not invariably,\r\nswelling of the under part of the jaw.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Bleed freely; diminish the quantity of food; and give an\r\nactive aperient every second day. Aloes are, perhaps, the best, combined\r\nwith colocynth; the dose will vary with the size of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPROSY.\r\n\r\nThis complaint commonly commences with the formation of a small tumor in\r\nthe eye, followed by a general prostration of spirits; the head is held\r\ndown; the whole frame inclines toward the ground; universal languor\r\nsucceeds; the animal refuses food, languishes, and rapidly falls away in\r\nflesh; blisters soon make their appearance beneath the tongue, then upon\r\nthe throat, the jaws, the head, and the entire body.\r\n\r\nThe _Causes_ of this disease are want of cleanliness, absence of fresh\r\nair, want of due attention to ventilation, and foul feeding. The obvious\r\n_treatment_, therefore, is, first, bleed; clean out the sty daily; wash\r\nthe affected animal thoroughly with soap and water, to which soda or\r\npotash has been added; supply him with a clean bed; keep him dry and\r\ncomfortable; let him have gentle exercise, and plenty of fresh air;\r\nlimit the quantity of his food, and diminish its rankness; give bran\r\nwith wash, in which add, for an average-sized hog--say one of one\r\nhundred and sixty pounds weight--a table-spoonful of the flour of\r\nsulphur, with as much nitre as will cover a dime, daily. A few grains of\r\npowdered antimony may also be given with effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETHARGY.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms_: torpor; desire to sleep; hanging of the head; and,\r\nfrequently, redness of the eyes. The origin of this disease is,\r\napparently, the same as that of indigestion, or surfeit, except that, in\r\nthis instance, it acts upon a hog having a natural tendency to a\r\nredundancy of blood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Bleed copiously; then administer an emetic. A decoction of\r\ncamomile flowers will be safest; though a sufficient dose of tartar\r\nemetic will be far more certain. After this, reduce for a few days the\r\namount of the animal's food, and administer a small portion of nitre and\r\nsulphur in each morning's meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGE.\r\n\r\nThis cutaneous affection owes its existence to the presence of a minute\r\ninsect, called _acarus scabiei_, or mange-fly, which burrows beneath the\r\ncuticle, and occasions much irritation and annoyance in its progress\r\nthrough the skin.\r\n\r\nIts _symptoms_ are sufficiently well known, consisting of scabs,\r\nblotches, and sometimes multitudes of minute pustules on different parts\r\nof the body. If neglected, these symptoms become aggravated; the disease\r\nspreads rapidly over the entire surface of the skin, and if allowed to\r\nproceed on its course unchecked, will before long produce deep-seated\r\nulcers and malignant sores, until the whole carcass of the affected\r\nanimal becomes a mass of corruption.\r\n\r\nThe _cause_ is to be looked for in dirt, accompanied by hot-feeding.\r\nHogs, however well and properly kept, will occasionally become affected\r\nwith this disease from contagion. Few diseases are more easily\r\npropagated by contact than mange. The introduction of a single affected\r\npig into an establishment may, in one night, cause the seizure of scores\r\nof others. No foul-skinned pigs, therefore, should be introduced into\r\nthe piggery; indeed, it would be an excellent precaution to wash every\r\nanimal newly purchased with a strong solution of chloride of lime.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ If the mange is but of moderate violence, and not of very\r\nlong standing, the best mode is to wash the animal, from snout to tail,\r\nleaving no portion of the body uncleansed, with soft soap and water.\r\nPlace him in a dry and clean sty, which is so situated as to command a\r\nconstant supply of fresh air, without, at the same time, an exposure to\r\ncold or draught; furnish a bed of clean, fresh straw. Reduce his food,\r\nboth in quality and quantity; let boiled or steamed roots, with\r\nbutter-milk, or dairy-wash take the place of any food of a heating or\r\ninflammatory character. Keep him without food for five or six hours, and\r\nthen give to a hog of average size two ounces of Epsom salts in a warm\r\nbran mash--to be increased or diminished, of course, as the animal's\r\nsize may require. This should be previously mixed with a pint of warm\r\nwater, and added to about half a gallon of warm bran mash, and it will\r\nact as a gentle purgative. Give in every meal afterward one\r\ntable-spoonful of flour of sulphur, and as much nitre as will cover a\r\ndime, for from three days to a week, according to the state of the\r\ndisease. When the scabs begin to heal, the pustules to retreat, and the\r\nfiery sores to fade, a cure may be anticipated.\r\n\r\nWhen the above treatment has been practised for fourteen days, without\r\neffecting a cure, prepare the following: train oil, one pint; oil of\r\ntar, two drachms; spirits of turpentine, two drachms; naphtha, one\r\ndrachm; with as much flour of sulphur as will form the foregoing into a\r\nthick paste. Rub the animal previously washed with this mixture; let no\r\nportion of the hide escape. Keep the hog dry and warm after this\r\napplication, and allow it to remain on his skin for three days. On the\r\nfourth day wash him again with soft soap, adding a small quantity of\r\nsoda to the water. Dry him well afterward, and let him remain as he is,\r\nhaving again changed his bedding, for a day or so; continue the sulphur\r\nand nitre as before. Almost all cases of mange, however obstinate, will,\r\nsooner or later, yield to this treatment. After he is convalescent,\r\nwhitewash the sty, and fumigate it by placing a little chloride of lime\r\nin a cup, or other vessel, and pouring a little vitriol upon it. In the\r\nabsence of vitriol, boiling water will answer nearly as well.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASLES.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most common diseases to which hogs are liable. The\r\n_symptoms_ are, redness of the eyes, foulness of the skin, and\r\ndepression of spirits; decline, or total departure of the appetite;\r\nsmall pustules about the throat, and red and purple eruptions on the\r\nskin. The last are more plainly visible after death, when they impart a\r\npeculiar appearance to the grain of the meat, with fading of its color,\r\nand distention of the fibre, giving an appearance similar to that which\r\nmight be produced by puncturing the flesh.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Allow the animal to fast, in the first instance, for\r\ntwenty-four hours, and then administer a warm drink, containing a drachm\r\nof carbonate of soda, and an ounce of bole armenian; wash the animal,\r\ncleanse the sty, and change the bedding; give at every feeding, or\r\nthrice a day, thirty grains of flour of sulphur, and ten of nitre.\r\n\r\nThis malady is attributable to dirt, combined with the giving of steamed\r\nfood or wash to hogs at too high a temperature. It is troublesome to\r\neradicate, but usually yields to treatment, and is rarely fatal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURRAIN.\r\n\r\nThis resembles leprosy in its _symptoms_, with the addition of\r\nstaggering, shortness of breath, and discharge of viscid matter from the\r\neyes and mouth.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ should consist of cleanliness, coolness, bleeding,\r\npurging, and limitation of food. Cloves of garlic are recommended; and\r\nas in all febrile diseases there exists a greater or less disposition to\r\nputrefaction, it is probable that garlic, from its antiseptic\r\nproperties, may be useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUINSY.\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammatory affection of the glands of the throat.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Shave away the hair, and rub with tartar-emetic ointment.\r\nFomenting with very warm water is also useful. When external suppuration\r\ntakes place, it is to be regarded as a favorable symptom. In this case,\r\nwait until the swellings are thoroughly ripe; then with a sharp knife\r\nmake an incision through the entire length, press out the matter, wash\r\nwith warm water, and afterward dress the wound with any resinous\r\nointment, or yellow soap with coarse brown sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAGGERS.\r\n\r\nThis disease is caused by an excessive determination of blood to the\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Bleed freely and purge.\r\n\r\n\r\nSWELLING OF THE SPLEEN.\r\n\r\nThe _symptom_ most positively indicative of this disease is the\r\ncircumstance of the affected animal leaning toward one side, cringing,\r\nas it were, from internal pain, and bending toward the ground.\r\n\r\nThe _cause_ of the obstruction on which the disease depends, is\r\nover-feeding--permitting the animal to indulge its appetite to the\r\nutmost extent that gluttony may prompt, and the capacity of its stomach\r\nadmits. A very short perseverance in this mode of management--or,\r\nrather, mismanagement--will produce this, as well as other maladies,\r\nderiving their origin from a depraved condition of the secretions and\r\nthe obstruction of the excretory ducts.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Clean out the alimentary canal by means of a powerful\r\naperient. Allow the animal to fast for four or five hours, when he will\r\ntake a little sweet wash or broth, in which may be mingled a dose of\r\nEpsom salts proportioned to his size. This will generally effect the\r\ndesired end--a copious evacuation--and the action of the medicine on the\r\nwatery secretions will also relieve the existing diseased condition of\r\nthe spleen.\r\n\r\nIf the affection has continued for any length, the animal should be\r\nbled. A decoction of the leaves and tops of wormwood and liverwort,\r\nproduced by boiling them in soft water for six hours, may be given in\r\ndoses of from half a pint to a pint and a half, according to the size,\r\nage, etc., of the animal. Scammony and rhubarb, mixed in a bran wash, or\r\nwith Indian meal, may be given with advantage on the following day; or,\r\nequal portions of blue-pill mass and compound colocynth pill, formed\r\ninto a bolus with butter. The animal having been kept fasting the\r\nprevious night, will probably swallow it; if not, let his fast continue\r\na couple of hours longer. Lower his diet, and keep him on reduced fare,\r\nwith exercise, and, if it can be managed, grazing, until the malady has\r\npassed away. If he is then to be fattened, it should be done gradually;\r\nbe cautious of at once restoring him to full diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURFEIT.\r\n\r\nThis is another name for indigestion. The _symptoms_ are, panting; loss\r\nof appetite; swelling of the region about the stomach, etc.; and\r\nfrequently throwing up the contents of the stomach.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ In general, this affection will pass away, provided only it\r\nis allowed to cure itself, and all food carefully kept from the animal\r\nfor a few hours; a small quantity of sweet grains, with a little bran\r\nmash, may then be given, but not nearly as much as the animal would wish\r\nto take. For a few days, the food should be limited in quantity, and of\r\na washy, liquid nature. The ordinary food may then be resumed, only\r\nobserving to feed regularly, and remove the fragments remaining after\r\neach meal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS.\r\n\r\nThese are hard swellings, which make their appearance on different parts\r\nof the body. They are not formidable, and require only to be suffered to\r\nprogress until they soften; then make a free incision, and press out the\r\nmatter. Sulphur and nitre should be given in the food, as the appearance\r\nof these swellings, whatever be their cause, indicates the necessity of\r\nalterative medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      POULTRY AND THEIR DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHISTORY AND VARIETIES\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMESTIC FOWL. The cock tribe is used as a generic term, to include\r\nthe whole family of domestic fowls; the name of the male, in this\r\ninstance, furnishing an appellation sufficiently comprehensive and well\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe domestic cock appears to have been known to man from a very early\r\nperiod. Of his real origin there is little definitely known; and even\r\nthe time and manner of his introduction into Greece, or Southern Europe,\r\nare enveloped in obscurity. In the palmiest days of Greece and Rome,\r\nhowever, he occupied a conspicuous place in those public shows which\r\namused the masses of the people. He was dedicated to the service of the\r\npagan deities, and was connected with the worship of Apollo, Mercury,\r\nMars, and particularly Esculapius. The flesh of this bird was highly\r\nesteemed as a delicacy, and occupied a prominent place at the Roman\r\nbanquets. Great pains were taken in the rearing and fattening of poultry\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe practice of cock-fighting, barbarous as it is, originated in classic\r\ntimes, and among the most polished and civilized people of antiquity. To\r\nits introduction into Britain by the Caesars we owe our acquaintance with\r\nthe domestic fowl.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to state positively to what species of the wild cock,\r\nknown at present, we are to look for the primitive type, so remote is\r\nthe date of the original domestication of the fowl. Many writers have\r\nendeavored to show that all the varieties of the domestic fowl, of which\r\nwe now have knowledge, are derived from a single primitive stock. It\r\nhas, also, been confidently asserted that the domestic cock owes his\r\norigin to the jungle fowl of India. The most probable supposition,\r\nhowever, is, that the varieties known to us may be referred to a few of\r\nthe more remarkable fowls, as the progenitors of the several species.\r\nThe great fowl of St. Jago and Sumatra may, perhaps, safely be\r\nrecognized as the type of some of the larger varieties, such as the\r\nSpanish and the Padua fowls, and those resembling them; while to the\r\nBankiva cock, probably, the smaller varieties belong, such as Bantams,\r\nthe Turkish fowl, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe reasons assigned for supposing these kinds to be the true originals\r\nof our domestic poultry, are, _first_, the close resemblance subsisting\r\nbetween their females and our domestic hens; _second_, the size of our\r\ndomestic cock being intermediate between the two, and alternating in\r\ndegree, sometimes inclining toward the one, and sometimes toward the\r\nother; _third_, from the nature of their feathers and their general\r\naspect--the form and distribution of their tails being the same as our\r\ndomestic fowls; and, _fourth_, in these two birds alone are the females\r\nprovided with a crest and small wattles, characteristics not to be met\r\nwith in any other wild species.\r\n\r\nThe wild cock, or the St. Jago fowl, is frequently so tall as to be able\r\nto peck crumbs without difficulty from an ordinary dinner-table. The\r\nweight is usually from ten to thirteen or fourteen pounds. The comb of\r\nboth cock and hen is large, crown-shaped, often double, and sometimes,\r\nbut not invariably, with a tufted crest of feathers, which occurs with\r\nthe greatest frequency, and grows to the largest size, in the hen. The\r\nvoice is strong and very harsh; and the young do not arrive to full\r\nplumage until more than half grown.\r\n\r\nThe Bankiva fowl is a native of Java, and is characterized by a red\r\nindented comb, red wattles, and ashy-gray legs and feet. The comb of the\r\ncock is scolloped, and the tail elevated a little above the rump, the\r\nfeathers being disposed in the form of tiles or slates; the\r\nneck-feathers are of a gold color, long, dependent, and rounded at the\r\ntips; the head and neck are of a fawn color; the wing coverts a dusky\r\nbrown and black; the tail and belly, black. The color of the hen is a\r\ndusky ash-gray and yellow; her comb and wattles much smaller than those\r\nof the cock, and--with the exception of the long hackles--she has no\r\nfeathers on her neck. These fowl are exceedingly wild, and inhabit the\r\nskirts of woods, forests, and other savage and unfrequented places.\r\nThese Bankivas resemble our Bantams very much; and, like them, are also\r\noccasionally to be seen feathered to the feet and toes.\r\n\r\nIndependent of all considerations of profitableness, domestic fowls are\r\ngifted with two qualifications, which--whether in man, beast, or\r\nbird--are sure to be popular: a courageous temper and an affectionate\r\ndisposition. When we add to these beauty of appearance and hardiness of\r\nconstitution, it is no wonder that they are held in such universal\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nThe courage of the cock is emblematic, his gallantry admirable, and his\r\nsense of discipline and subordination most exemplary. The hen is\r\ndeservedly the acknowledged pattern of maternal love. When her passion\r\nof philoprogenitiveness is disappointed by the failure or subtraction of\r\nher own brood, she will either continue incubating till her natural\r\npowers fail, or will violently kidnap the young of other fowls, and\r\ninsist upon adopting them.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to attempt an enumeration here of the numerous breeds\r\nand varieties of the domestic fowl. Those only, therefore, will be\r\ndescribed which are generally accepted as the best varieties; and these\r\narranged, not in the order of their merits necessarily, but\r\nalphabetically, for convenience of reference.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BANTAM.\r\n\r\nThe original of the Bantam is, as has been already remarked, the Bankiva\r\nfowl. The small white, and also the colored Bantams, whose legs are\r\nheavily feathered, are sufficiently well-known to render a particular\r\ndescription unnecessary. Bantam-fanciers generally prefer those which\r\nhave clean, bright legs, without any vestige of feathers. A\r\nthorough-bred cock, in their judgment, should have a rose comb; a\r\nwell-feathered tail, but without the sickle feathers; full hackles; a\r\nproud, lively carriage; and ought not to exceed a pound in weight. The\r\nnankeen-colored, and the black are the general favorites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BANTAM.]\r\n\r\nThese little creatures exhibit some peculiar habits and traits of\r\ndisposition. Amongst others, the cocks are so fond of sucking the eggs\r\nlaid by the hen that they will often drive her from the nest in order to\r\nobtain them; they have even been known to attack her, tear open the\r\novarium, and devour its shell-less contents. To prevent this, first a\r\nhard-boiled, and then a marble egg may be given them to fight with,\r\ntaking care, at the same time, to prevent their access either to the hen\r\nor to any real eggs. Another strange propensity is a passion for sucking\r\neach other's blood, which is chiefly exhibited when they are moulting,\r\nwhen they have been known to peck each other naked, by pulling out the\r\nnew feathers as they appear, and squeezing with their beaks the blood\r\nfrom the bulbs at the base. These fowls being subject to a great heat of\r\nthe skin, its surface occasionally becomes hard and tightened; in which\r\ncases the hard roots of the feathers are drawn into a position more\r\nnearly at right angles with the body than at ordinary times, and the\r\nskin and superficial muscles are thus subjected to an unusual degree of\r\npainful irritation. The disagreeable habit is, therefore, simply a\r\nprovision of Nature for their relief, which may be successfully\r\naccomplished by washing with warm water, and the subsequent application\r\nof pomatum to the skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANTAM.]\r\n\r\nBantams, in general, are greedy devourers of some of the most\r\ndestructive of our insects; the grub of the cock-chafer and the\r\ncrane-fly being especial favorites with them. Their chickens can hardly\r\nbe raised so well, as by allowing them free access to minute insect\r\ndainties; hence, the suitableness of a worn-out hotbed for them during\r\nthe first month or six weeks. They are thus positively serviceable\r\ncreatures to the farmer, as far as their limited range extends; and\r\nstill more so to the gardener and the nurseryman, as they will save\r\nvarious garden crops from injuries to which they would otherwise be\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\nThe fowl commonly known as the Bantam is a small, elegantly-formed, and\r\nhandsomely tinted variety, evidently but remotely allied to the game\r\nbreed, and furnished with feathers to the toes.\r\n\r\nTHE AFRICAN BANTAM. The cock of this variety is red upon the neck, back,\r\nand hackles; tail, black and erect, studded with glossy green feathers\r\nupon the sides; breast, black ground spotted with yellow, like the\r\nGolden Pheasant; comb, single; cheeks, white or silvery; the pullet is\r\nentirely black, except the inside of the wing-tips, which is perfectly\r\nwhite. In size, they compare with the common pigeon, being very small;\r\ntheir wings are about two inches longer than their bodies; and their\r\nlegs dark and destitute of feathers. They are very quiet, and of decided\r\nbenefit in gardens, in destroying bugs.\r\n\r\nThese symmetrically-formed birds are highly prized, both by the fancier\r\nand the practical man, and the pure-bloods are very rare. They weigh\r\nfrom eight to twelve ounces each for the hens; and the cocks, from\r\nsixteen to twenty ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOLTON GRAY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOLTON GRAYS OR CREOLE FOWL.]\r\n\r\nThese fowls--called, also, Dutch Every-day Layers, Pencilled Dutch Fowl,\r\nChittaprats, and, in Pennsylvania, Creole Fowl--were originally imported\r\nfrom Holland to Bolton, a town in Lancashire, England, whence they were\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThey are small sized, short in the leg, and plump in the make; color of\r\nthe genuine kind, invariably pure white in the whole cappel of the neck;\r\nthe body white, thickly spotted with black, sometimes running into a\r\ngrizzle, with one or more black bars at the extremity of the tail. A\r\ngood cock of this breed may weigh from four to four and a half pounds;\r\nand a hen from three to three and a half pounds.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of a hen of this breed does not consist so much in rapid\r\nas in continued laying. She may not produce as many eggs in a month as\r\nsome other kinds, but she will, it is claimed, lay more months in the\r\nyear than probably any other variety. They are said to be very hardy;\r\nbut their eggs, in the judgment of some, are rather watery and\r\ninnutritious.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE DUN.\r\n\r\nThe variety known under this name originated in Dorsetshire, England.\r\nThey are under the average size, rather slenderly made, of a soft and\r\npleasing bluish-dun color, the neck being darker, with high, single\r\ncombs, deeply serrated. The cock is of the same color as the hen, but\r\nhas, in addition, some handsome dark stripes in the long feathers of the\r\ntail, and sometimes a few golden, or even scarlet marks, on the wings.\r\nThey are exceedingly impudent, familiar, and pugnacious.\r\n\r\nThe hens are good layers, wanting to sit after laying a moderate number\r\nof eggs, and proving attentive and careful rearers of their own\r\nchickens, but rather savage to those of other hens. The eggs are small\r\nand short, tapering slightly at one end, and perfectly white. The\r\nchickens, on first coming from the egg, sometimes bear a resemblance to\r\nthe gray and yellow catkin of the willow, being of a soft bluish gray,\r\nmixed with a little yellow here and there.\r\n\r\nSome class these birds among the game fowls, not recognizing them as a\r\ndistinct race, upon the ground that, as there are Blue Dun families\r\nbelonging to several breeds--the Spanish, the Polish, the Game, and the\r\nHamburghs, for example--it is more correct to refer each Blue Dun to its\r\nown proper ancestry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHITTAGONG.\r\n\r\nThe Chittagong is a very superior bird, showy in plumage, exceedingly\r\nhardy, and of various colors. In some, the gray predominates,\r\ninterspersed with lightish yellow and white feathers upon the pullets.\r\nThe legs are of a reddish flesh-color; the meat is delicately white, the\r\ncomb large and single, wattles very full, wings good size. The legs are\r\nmore or less feathered; the model is graceful, carriage proud and easy,\r\nand action prompt and determined.\r\n\r\nThis breed is the largest in the world; the pullets usually weighing\r\nfrom eight to nine pounds when they begin to lay, and the cocks from\r\nnine to ten pounds at the same age. They do not lay as many eggs in a\r\nyear as smaller hens; but they lay as many pounds of eggs as the best\r\nbreeds. This breed has been, by some, confounded with the great Malay;\r\nbut the points of difference are very noticeable. There is less offal;\r\nthe flesh is finer, although the size is greatly increased; their\r\nfecundity is greater; and the offspring arrive earlier at maturity than\r\nin the common Malay variety.\r\n\r\nThere is also a _red_ variety of the Chittagong, which is rather\r\nsmaller than the gray. These have legs sometimes yellow and sometimes\r\nblue; the latter color, perhaps, from some mixture with the dark\r\nvariety; the wings and tail are short. Sometimes there is a rose-colored\r\ncomb, and a top-knot, through crossing. This variety may weigh sixteen\r\nor eighteen pounds a pair, as ordinarily bred. The eggs are large and\r\nrich, but not very abundant, and they do not hatch remarkably well.\r\n\r\nThere is, besides, a _dark-red_ variety; the hens yellow or brown, with\r\nsingle serrated comb, and no top-knot; legs heavily feathered, the\r\nfeathers black and the legs yellow. The cock is black on the breast and\r\nthighs.\r\n\r\nThe Chittagongs are generally quite leggy, standing some twenty-six\r\ninches high; and the hens twenty-two inches. A first cross with the\r\nShanghae makes a very large and valuable bird for the table, but not for\r\nbreeding purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COCHIN CHINA.\r\n\r\nThe Cochin China fowl are said to have been presented to Queen Victoria\r\nfrom the East Indies. In order to promote their propagation, her majesty\r\nmade presents of them occasionally to such persons as she supposed\r\nlikely to appreciate them. They differ very little in their qualities,\r\nhabits, and general appearance from the Shanghaes, to which they are\r\nundoubtedly nearly related. The egg is nearly the same size, shape, and\r\ncolor; both have an equal development of comb and wattles--the Cochins\r\nslightly differing from the Shanghaes, chiefly in being somewhat fuller\r\nand deeper in the breast, not quite so deep in the quarter, and being\r\nusually smooth-legged, while the Shanghaes, generally, are more or less\r\nheavily feathered. The plumage is much the same in both cases; and the\r\ncrow in both is equally sonorous and prolonged, differing considerably\r\nfrom that of the Great Malay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COCHIN CHINAS.]\r\n\r\nThe cock has a large, upright, single, deeply-indented comb, very much\r\nresembling that of the Black Spanish, and, when in high condition, of\r\nquite as brilliant a scarlet; like him, also, he has sometimes a very\r\nlarge white ear-hole on each cheek, which, if not an indispensable or\r\neven a required qualification, is, however, to be preferred, for beauty\r\nat least. The wattles are large, wide, and pendent. The legs are of a\r\npale flesh-color; some specimens have them yellow, which is\r\nobjectionable. The feathers on the breast and sides are of a bright\r\nchestnut-brown, large and well-defined, giving a scaly or imbricated\r\nappearance to those parts. The hackle of the neck is of a light\r\nyellowish brown; the lower feathers being tipped with dark brown, so as\r\nto give a spotted appearance to the neck. The tail-feathers are black,\r\nand darkly iridescent; back, scarlet-orange; back-hackle, yellow-orange.\r\nIt is, in short, altogether a flame-colored bird. Both sexes are lower\r\nin the leg than either the Black Spanish or the Malay.\r\n\r\nThe hen approaches in her build more nearly to the Dorking than to any\r\nother breed, except that the tail is very small and proportionately\r\ndepressed; it is smaller and more horizontal than in any other fowl. Her\r\ncomb is of moderate size, almost small; she has, also, a small, white\r\near-hole. Her coloring is flat, being composed of various shades of very\r\nlight brown, with light yellow on the neck. Her appearance is quiet, and\r\nonly attracts attention by its extreme neatness, cleanliness, and\r\ncompactness.\r\n\r\nThe eggs average about two ounces each. They are smooth, of an oval\r\nshape, equally rounded at each end, and of a rich buff color, nearly\r\nresembling those of the Silver Pheasant. The newly-hatched chickens\r\nappear very large in proportion to the size of the egg. They have light,\r\nflesh-colored bills, feet, and legs, and are thickly covered with down,\r\nof the hue commonly called \"carroty.\" They are not less thrifty than any\r\nother chickens, and feather somewhat more uniformly than either the\r\nBlack Spanish or the Malay. It is, however, most desirable to hatch\r\nthese--as well as other large-growing varieties--as early in the spring\r\nas possible; even so soon as the end of February. A peculiarity in the\r\ncockerels is, that they do not show even the rudiments of their\r\ntail-feathers till they are nearly full-grown. They increase so rapidly\r\nin other directions, that there is no material to spare for the\r\nproduction of these decorative appendages.\r\n\r\nThe merits of this breed are such that it may safely be recommended to\r\npeople residing in the country. For the inhabitants of towns it is less\r\ndesirable, as the light tone of its plumage would show every mark of\r\ndirt and defilement; and the readiness with which they sit would be an\r\ninconvenience, rather than otherwise, in families with whom perpetual\r\nlayers are most in requisition. Expense apart, they are equal or\r\nsuperior to any other fowl for the table; their flesh is delicate,\r\nwhite, tender, and well flavored.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUCKOO.\r\n\r\nThe fowl so termed in Norfolk, England, is, very probably, an old and\r\ndistinct variety; although they are generally regarded as mere Barn-door\r\nfowls--that is, the merely accidental result of promiscuous crossing.\r\n\r\nThe name probably originated from its barred, plumage, which resembles\r\nthat on the breast of the Cuckoo. The prevailing color is a slaty blue,\r\nundulated, and softly shaded with white all over the body, forming bands\r\nof various widths. The comb is very small; irides, bright orange; feet\r\nand legs, light flesh-color. The hens are of a good size; the cocks are\r\nlarge, approaching the heaviest breeds in weight. The chickens, at two\r\nor three months old, exhibits the barred plumage even more perfectly\r\nthan the full-grown birds. The eggs average about two ounces each, are\r\nwhite, and of porcelain smoothness. The newly-hatched chickens are\r\ngray, much resembling those of the Silver Polands, except in the color\r\nof the feet and legs.\r\n\r\nThis breed supplies an unfailing troop of good layers, good sitters,\r\ngood mothers and good feeders; and is well worth promotion in the\r\npoultry-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMINIQUE.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a tolerably distinct and permanent variety, about the\r\nsize of the common Dunghill Fowl. Their combs are generally double--or\r\nrose, as it is sometimes called--and the wattles small. Their plumage\r\npresents, all over, a sort of greenish appearance, from a peculiar\r\narrangement of blue and white feathers, which is the chief\r\ncharacteristic of the variety; although, in some specimens, the plumage\r\nis inevitably gray in both cock and hen. They are very hardy, healthy,\r\nexcellent layers, and capital incubators. No fowl have better stood the\r\ntests of mixing without deteriorating than the pure Dominique.\r\n\r\nTheir name is taken from the island of Dominica, from which they are\r\nreported to have been imported. Take all in all, they are one of the\r\nvery best breeds of fowl which we have; and although they do not come in\r\nto laying so young as the Spanish, they are far better sitters and\r\nnursers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DORKING.\r\n\r\nThis has been termed the Capon Fowl of England. It forms the chief\r\nsupply for the London market, and is distinguished by a white or\r\nflesh-colored smooth leg, armed with five, instead of four toes, on each\r\nfoot. Its flesh is extremely delicate, especially after caponization;\r\nand it has the advantage over some other fowls of feeding rapidly, and\r\ngrowing to a very respectable size when properly managed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE DORKINGS.]\r\n\r\nFor those who wish to stock their poultry yards with fowls of the most\r\ndesirable shape and size, clothed in rich and varigated plumage, and,\r\nnot expecting perfection, are willing to overlook one or two other\r\npoints, the Speckled Dorkings--so called from the town of Surrey,\r\nEngland, which brought them into modern repute--should be selected. The\r\nhens, in addition to their gay colors, have a large, vertically flat\r\ncomb, which, when they are in high health, adds very much to their\r\nbrilliant appearance, particularly if seen in bright sunshine. The cocks\r\nare magnificent. The most gorgeous hues are lavished upon them, which\r\ntheir great size and peculiarly square-built form display to the\r\ngreatest advantage. Their legs are short; their breast broad; there is\r\nbut a small proportion of offal; and the good, profitable flesh is\r\nabundant. The cocks may be brought to considerable weight, and the\r\nflavor and appearance of their meat are inferior to none. The eggs are\r\nproduced in reasonable abundance; and, though not equal in size to those\r\nof Spanish hens, may fairly be called large.\r\n\r\nThey are not everlasting layers, but at due or convenient intervals\r\nmanifest the desire of sitting. In this respect, they are steady and\r\ngood mothers when the little ones appear. They are better adapted than\r\nany other fowl, except the Malay, to hatch superabundant turkeys' eggs;\r\nas their size and bulk enable them to afford warmth and shelter to the\r\nyoung for a long period. For the same reason, spare goose eggs may be\r\nentrusted to them.\r\n\r\nWith all these merits, however, they are not found to be a profitable\r\nbreed, if kept thorough-bred and unmixed. Their powers seem to fail at\r\nan early age. They are also apt to pine away and die just at the point\r\nof reaching maturity. They appear at a certain epoch to be seized with\r\nconsumption--in the Speckled Dorkings, the lungs seeming to be the seat\r\nof the disease. The White Dorkings are, however, hardy and active birds,\r\nand are not subject to consumption or any other disease.\r\n\r\nAs mothers, an objection to the Dorkings is, that they are too heavy and\r\nclumsy to rear the chickens of any smaller and more delicate bird than\r\nthemselves. Pheasants, partridges, bantams, and Guinea fowl are trampled\r\nunder foot and crushed, if in the least weakly. The hen, in her\r\naffectionate industry in scratching for grub, kicks her smallest\r\nnurslings right and left, and leaves them sprawling on their backs; and\r\nbefore they are a month old, half of them will be muddled to death with\r\nthis rough kindness.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these drawbacks, the Dorkings are still in high favor; but a\r\ncross is found to be more profitable than the true breed. A glossy,\r\nenergetic game-cock, with Dorking hens, produces chickens in size and\r\nbeauty little inferior to their maternal parentage, and much more\r\nrobust. The supernumerary toe on each foot almost always disappears\r\nwith the first cross; but it is a point which can very well be spared\r\nwithout much disadvantage. In other respects, the appearance of the\r\nnewly-hatched chickens is scarcely altered. The eggs of the Dorkings are\r\nlarge, pure white, very much rounded, and nearly equal in size at each\r\nend. The chickens are brownish-yellow, with a broad brown stripe down\r\nthe middle of the back, and a narrower one on each side; feet and legs\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nTHE FAWN-COLORED DORKING. The fowl bearing this name is a cross between\r\nthe white Dorking and the fawn-colored Turkish fowl. They are, of lofty\r\ncarriage, handsome, and healthy. The males of this breed weigh from\r\neight to nine pounds, and the females from six to seven; and they come\r\nto maturity early for so large a fowl. Their tails are shorter and their\r\neggs darker than those of other Dorkings; their flesh is fine and their\r\neggs rich. It is one of the best varieties of fowl known, as the size is\r\nreadily increased without diminishing the fineness of the flesh.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK DORKING. The bodies of this variety are of a large size, with\r\nthe usual proportions of the race, and of a jet-black color. The\r\nneck-feathers of some of the cocks are tinged with a bright gold color,\r\nand those of some of the hens bear a silvery complexion. Their combs are\r\nusually double, and very short, though sometimes cupped, rose, or\r\nsingle, with wattles small; and they are usually very red about the\r\nhead. Their tails are rather shorter and broader than most of the race,\r\nand they feather rather slowly. Their legs are short and black, with\r\nfive toes on each foot, the bottom of which is sometimes yellow. The two\r\nback toes are very distinct, starting from the foot separately; and\r\nthere is frequently a part of an extra toe between the two.\r\n\r\nThis breed commence laying when very young, and are very thrifty layers\r\nduring winter. Their eggs are of a large size, and hatch well; they are\r\nperfectly hardy, as their color indicates, and for the product are\r\nconsidered among the most valuable of the Dorking breed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUNGHILL FOWL.\r\n\r\nThis is sometimes called the Barn-door fowl, and is characterized by a\r\nthin, serrated, upright comb, and wattles hanging from each side of the\r\nlower mandible; the tail rises in an arch, above the level of the rump;\r\nthe feathers of the rump are long and line-like; and the color is finely\r\nvariegated. The female's comb and wattles are smaller than those of the\r\ncock; she is less in size, and her colors are more dull and sombre.\r\n\r\nIn the best specimens of this variety, the legs should be white and\r\nsmooth, like those of the Dorking, and their bodies round and plump.\r\nBeing mongrels, they breed all colors, and are usually from five to\r\nseven or eight pounds per pair.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIZZLED FOWL.\r\n\r\nThis fowl is erroneously supposed to be a native of Japan, and, by an\r\nequally common error, is frequently called the \"Friesland,\" under the\r\napprehension that it is derived from that place. Its name, however,\r\noriginates from its peculiar appearance. It is difficult to say whether\r\nthis is an aboriginal variety, or merely a peculiar instance of the\r\nmorphology of feathers; the circumstance that there are also frizzled\r\nBantams, would seem to make in favor of the latter position.\r\n\r\nThe feathers are ruffled or frizzled, and the reversion makes them\r\npeculiarly susceptible of cold and wet, since their plumage is of little\r\nuse as clothing. They have thus the demerit of being tender as well as\r\nugly. In good specimens, every feather looks as if it had been curled\r\nthe wrong way with a pair of hot curling-irons. The plumage is\r\nvariegated in its colors; and there are two varieties, called the Black\r\nand White Frizzled. The stock, which is rather curious than valuable, is\r\nretained in this country more by importation than by rearing.\r\n\r\nSome writers say that this variety is a native of Asia, and that it\r\nexists in a domestic state throughout Java, Sumatra, and all the\r\nPhilippine islands, where it succeeds well. It is, according to such,\r\nuncertain in what country it is still found wild.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAME FOWL.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that these fowl, like other choice varieties, are natives\r\nof India. It is certain that in that country an original race of some\r\nfowl exists, at the present day, bearing in full perfection all the\r\npeculiar characteristics of the species. In India, as is well known, the\r\nnatives are infected with a passion for cock-fighting. These fowls are\r\ncarefully bred for this barbarous amusement, and the finest birds become\r\narticles of great value. In Sumatra, the inhabitants are so much\r\naddicted to the cruel sports to which these fowls are devoted, that\r\ninstances are recorded of men staking not only their property upon the\r\nissue of a fight, but even their wives and children. The Chinese are\r\nlikewise passionately fond of this pastime; as, indeed, are all the\r\ninhabitants of the Indian countries professing the Mussulman creed. The\r\nRomans introduced the practice into Britain, in which country the\r\nearliest recorded cock-fight dates back to about the year 1100. In\r\nMexico and the South American countries it is still a national\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAY GAME FOWLS.]\r\n\r\nThe game fowl is one of the most gracefully formed and beautifully\r\ncolored of our domestic breeds of poultry; and in its form, aspect, and\r\nthat extraordinary courage which characterizes its natural disposition,\r\nexhibits all that either the naturalist or the sportsman would at once\r\nrecognize as the purest type of high blood, embodying, in short, all the\r\nmost indubitable characteristics of gallinaceous aristocracy.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat inferior in size to other breeds, and in its shape\r\napproximates more closely to the elegance and lightness of form usually\r\ncharacteristic of a pure and uncontaminated race. Amongst poultry, he is\r\nwhat the Arabian is amongst horses, the high-bred Short-horn amongst\r\ncattle, and the fleet greyhound amongst the canine race.\r\n\r\nThe flesh is beautifully white, as well as tender and delicate. The hens\r\nare excellent layers, and although the eggs are under the average size,\r\nthey are not to be surpassed in excellence of flavor. Such being the\r\ncharacter of this variety of fowl, it would doubtless be much more\r\nextensively cultivated than it is, were it not for the difficulty\r\nattending the rearing of the young; their pugnacity being such, that a\r\nbrood is scarcely feathered before at least one-half are killed or\r\nblinded by fighting.\r\n\r\nWith proper care, however, most of the difficulties to be apprehended\r\nmay be avoided. It is exceedingly desirable to perpetuate the race, for\r\nuses the most important and valuable. As a cross with other breeds, they\r\nare invaluable in improving the flavor of the flesh, which is an\r\ninvariable consequence. The plumage of all fowl related to them is\r\nincreased in brilliancy; and they are, moreover, very prolific, and the\r\neggs are always enriched.\r\n\r\nTHE MEXICAN HEN-COCK. This unique breed is a favorite variety with the\r\nMexicans, who term them Hen-cocks from the fact that the male birds have\r\nshort, broad tails, and, in color and plumage, the appearance of the\r\nhens of the same variety, differing only in the comb, which is very\r\nlarge and erect in the cock, and small in the hen. They are generally\r\npheasant-colored, with occasional changes in plumage from a light yellow\r\nto a dark gray; and, in some instances, there is a tendency to black\r\ntail-feathers and breast, as well as an inclination to gray and light\r\nyellow, and with a slight approximation to red hackles in some rare\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nThis variety has a strong frame, and very large and muscular thighs. The\r\ncocks are distinguished by large, upright combs, strong bills, and very\r\nlarge, lustrous eyes. The legs vary from a dirty to a dark-green color.\r\nThe hen does not materially differ in appearance from the cock. They\r\nare as good layers and sitters as any other game breed, and are good\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD INDIAN GAME. This variety was originally imported into this\r\ncountry from Calcutta. The hen has a long neck, like a wild goose;\r\nneither comb nor wattles; of a dark, glossy green color; very short fan\r\ntail; lofty in carriage, trim built, and wild in general appearance;\r\nlegs very large and long, spotted with blue; ordinary weight from four\r\nand a half to six pounds. As a layer, she is equal to other fowls of the\r\ngame variety.\r\n\r\nThe cock stands as high as a large turkey, and weighs nine pounds and\r\nupward; the plumage is of a reddish cast, interspersed with spots of\r\nglossy green; comb very small; no wattles; and bill unlike every other\r\nfowl, except the hen.\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH GAME. This variety is called the English fowl by some\r\nwriters. It is more slender in the body, the neck, the bill, and the\r\nlegs, than the other varieties, and the colors, particularly of the\r\ncock, are very bright and showy. The flesh is white, tender, and\r\ndelicate, and on this account marketable; the eggs are small, and\r\nextremely delicate. The plumage is very beautiful--a clear, dark red,\r\nvery bright, extending from the back to the extremities, while the\r\nbreast is beautifully black. The upper convex side of the wing is\r\nequally red and black, and the whole of the tail-feathers white. The\r\nbeak and legs are black; the eyes resemble jet beads, very full and\r\nbrilliant; and the whole contour of the head gives a most ferocious\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUELDERLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Guelderland fowl were originally imported into this country from the\r\nnorth of Holland, where they are supposed to have originated. They are\r\nvery symmetrical in form, and graceful in their motions. They have one\r\nnoticeable peculiarity, which consists in the absence of a comb in\r\neither sex. This is replaced by an indentation on the top of the head;\r\nand from the extreme end of this, at the back, a small spike of feathers\r\nrises. This adds greatly to the beauty of the fowl. The presence of the\r\nmale is especially dignified, and the female is little inferior in\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUELDERLANDS.]\r\n\r\nThe plumage is of a beautiful black, tinged with blue, of very rich\r\nappearance, and bearing a brilliant gloss. The legs are black, and, in\r\nsome few instances, slightly feathered. Crosses with the Shanghae have\r\nheavily feathered legs. The wattles are of good size in the cock, while\r\nthose of the hen are slightly less. The flesh is fine, of white color,\r\nand of excellent flavor. The eggs are large and delicate--the shell\r\nbeing thicker than in those of most other fowls--and are much prized for\r\ntheir good qualities. The hens are great layers, seldom inclining to\r\nsit. Their weight is from five pounds for the pullets, to seven pounds\r\nfor the cocks.\r\n\r\nThe Guelderlands, in short, possess all the characteristics of a perfect\r\nbreed; and in breeding them, this is demonstrated by the uniform aspect\r\nwhich is observable in their descendants. They are light and active\r\nbirds, and are not surpassed, in point of beauty and utility, by any\r\nbreed known in this country. The only objection, indeed, which has been\r\nraised against them is the tenderness of the chickens. With a degree of\r\ncare, however, equal to their value, this difficulty can be surmounted,\r\nand the breed must be highly appreciated by all who have a taste for\r\nbeauty, and who desire fine flesh and luscious eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANGLED HAMBURGH.\r\n\r\nThe Spangled Hamburgh fowl are divided into two varieties, the\r\ndistinctive characteristics being slight, and almost dependent upon\r\ncolor; these varieties are termed the Golden and Silver Spangled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMBURGH FOWLS.]\r\n\r\n_The Golden Spangled_ is one of no ordinary beauty; it is well and very\r\nneatly made, has a good body, and no very great offal. On the crest,\r\nimmediately above the beak, are two small, fleshy horns, resembling, to\r\nsome extent, an abortive comb. Above this crest, and occupying the place\r\nof a comb, is a very large brown or yellow tuft, the feathers composing\r\nit darkening toward their extremities. Under the insertion of the lower\r\nmandible--or that portion of the neck corresponding to the chin in\r\nman--is a full, dark-colored tuft, somewhat resembling a beard. The\r\nwattles are very small; the comb, as in other high-crested fowls, is\r\nvery diminutive; and the skin and flesh white. The hackles on the neck\r\nare of a brilliant orange, or golden yellow; and the general\r\nground-color of the body is of the same hue, but somewhat darker. The\r\nthighs are of a dark-brown or blackish shade, and the legs and feet are\r\nof a bluish gray.\r\n\r\nIn the _Silver Spangled_ variety, the only perceptible difference is,\r\nthat the ground color is a silvery white. The extremity and a portion of\r\nthe extreme margin of each feather are black, presenting, when in a\r\nstate of rest, the appearance of regular semicircular marks, or\r\nspangles--and hence the name, \"Spangled Hamburgh;\" the varieties being\r\ntermed _gold_ or _silver_, according to the prevailing color being\r\nbright yellow, or silvery white.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are of moderate size, but abundant; chickens easily reared. In\r\nmere excellence of flesh and as layers, they are inferior to the Dorking\r\nor the Spanish. They weigh from four and a half to five and a half\r\npounds for the male, and three and a half for the female. The former\r\nstands some twenty inches in height, and the latter about eighteen\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JAVA.\r\n\r\nThe Great Java fowl is seldom seen in this country in its purity. They\r\nare of a black or dark auburn color, with very large, thick legs, single\r\ncomb and wattles. They are good layers, and their eggs are very large\r\nand well-flavored; their gait is slow and majestic. They are, in fact,\r\namongst the most valuable fowls in the country, and are frequently\r\ndescribed as Spanish fowls, than which nothing is more erroneous.\r\n\r\nThey are as distinctly an original breed as the pure-blooded Great\r\nMalay, and possess about the same qualities as to excellence, but fall\r\nrather short of them in beauty. Some, however, consider the pure Java\r\nsuperior to all other large fowls, so far as beauty is concerned. Their\r\nplumage is decidedly rich.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JERSEY-BLUE.\r\n\r\nThe color of this variety is light-blue, sometimes approaching to dun;\r\nthe tail and wings rather shorter than those of the common fowl; its\r\nlegs are of various colors, generally black, sometimes lightly\r\nfeathered. Of superior specimens, the cocks weigh from seven to nine\r\npounds, and the hens from six to eight.\r\n\r\nThey are evidently mongrels; and though once much esteemed, they have\r\nbeen quite neglected, so far as breeding from them is concerned, since\r\nthe introduction of the purer breeds, as the Shanghaes and the\r\nCochin-Chinas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARK-CRESTED FOWL.\r\n\r\nThis breed is sometimes confounded with the Polish fowl; but the shape\r\nof the crest, as well as the proportions of the bird, is different.\r\nThis variety, of whatever color it may be, is of a peculiar taper-form,\r\ninclining forward, with a moderately depressed, backward-directed crest,\r\nand deficient in the neatness of the legs and feet so conspicuous in the\r\nPolands; the latter are of more upright carriage and of a more\r\nsquarely-built frame. Perhaps a good distinction between the two\r\nvarieties is, that the Lark-crested have an occipital crest, and the\r\nPoland more of a frontal one.\r\n\r\nThey are of various colors: pure snow white, brown with yellow hackles,\r\nand black. The white is, perhaps, more brilliant than is seen in any\r\nother domesticated gallinaceous bird, being much more dazzling than that\r\nof the White Guinea Fowl, or the White Pea Fowl. This white variety is\r\nin great esteem, having a remarkably neat and lively appearance when\r\nrambling about a homestead. They look very clean and attractive when\r\ndressed for market; an old bird, cleverly trussed, will be, apparently,\r\nas delicate and transparent in skin and flesh as an ordinary chicken.\r\nTheir feathers are also more salable than those from darker colored\r\nfowls. They are but little, if, indeed, any, more tender than other\r\nkinds raised near the barn-door; they are in every way preferable to the\r\nWhite Dorkings.\r\n\r\nIn the cocks, a single, upright comb sometimes almost entirely takes the\r\nplace of the crest; the hens, too, vary in this respect, some having not\r\nmore than half a dozen feathers in their head-dress.\r\n\r\nIf they were not of average merit, as to their laying and sitting\r\nqualifications, they would not retain the favor they do with the thrifty\r\nhouse-wives by whom they are chiefly cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MALAY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MALAYS.]\r\n\r\nThis majestic bird is found on the peninsula from which it derives its\r\nname, and, in the opinion of many, forms a connecting link between the\r\nwild and domesticated races of fowls. Something very like them is,\r\nindeed, still to be found in the East. This native Indian bird--the\r\n_Gigantic Cock_, the _Kulm Cock_ of Europeans--often stands considerably\r\nmore than two feet from the crown of the head to the ground. The comb\r\nextends backward in a line with the eyes; it is thick, a little\r\nelevated, rounded upon the top, and has almost the appearance of having\r\nbeen cut off. The wattles of the under mandibles are comparatively\r\nsmall, and the throat is bare. Pale, golden-reddish hackles ornament the\r\nhead, neck, and upper part of the back, and some of these spring before\r\nthe bare part of the throat. The middle of the back and smaller\r\nwing-coverts are deep chestnut, the webs of the feathers disunited; pale\r\nreddish-yellow, long, drooping hackles cover the rump and base of the\r\ntail, which last is very ample, and entirely of a glossy green, of which\r\ncolor are the wing-coverts; the secondaries and quills are pale\r\nreddish-yellow on their outer webs. All the under parts are deep glossy\r\nblackish-green, with high reflections; the deep chestnut of the base of\r\nthe feathers appears occasionally, and gives a mottled and interrupted\r\nappearance to those parts.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the Malay, in general, exceeds that of the Cochin-China;\r\nthe male weighing, when full-grown, from eleven to twelve, and even\r\nthirteen pounds, and the female from eight to ten pounds; height, from\r\ntwenty-six to twenty-eight inches. They present no striking uniformity\r\nof plumage, being of all shades, from black to white; the more common\r\ncolor of the female is a light reddish-yellow, with sometimes a faint\r\ntinge of dunnish-blue, especially in the tail.\r\n\r\nThe cock is frequently of a yellowish-red color, with black intermingled\r\nin the breast, thighs, and tail. He has a small, but thick comb,\r\ngenerally inclined to one side; he should be snake-headed, and free from\r\nthe slightest trace of top-knot; the wattles should be extremely small,\r\neven in an old bird; the legs are not feathered, as in the case of the\r\nShanghaes, but, like them and the Cochin-Chinas, his tail is small,\r\ncompared with his size. In the female, there is scarcely any show of\r\ncomb or wattles. Their legs are long and stout; their flesh is very\r\nwell flavored, when they have been properly fattened; and their eggs are\r\nso large and rich that two of them are equal to three of those of our\r\nordinary fowls.\r\n\r\nThe Malay cock, in his perfection, is a remarkably courageous and strong\r\nbird. His beak is very thick, and he is a formidable antagonist when\r\noffended. His crow is loud, harsh, and prolonged, as in the case of the\r\nCochin-China, but broken off abruptly at the termination; this is quite\r\ncharacteristic of the bird.\r\n\r\nThe chickens are at first very strong, with yellow legs, and are thickly\r\ncovered with light brown down; but, by the time they are one-third\r\ngrown, the increase of their bodies has so far outstripped that of their\r\nfeathers, that they are half naked about the back and shoulders, and\r\nextremely susceptible of cold and wet. The great secret of rearing them\r\nis, to have them hatched very early indeed, so that they may have safely\r\npassed through this period of unclothed adolescence during the dry,\r\nsunny part of May and June, and reached nearly their full stature before\r\nthe midsummer rains descend.\r\n\r\nMalay hens are much used by some for hatching the eggs of turkeys--a\r\ntask for which they are well adapted in every respect but one, which is,\r\nthat they will follow their natural instinct in turning off their\r\nchickens at the usual time, instead of retaining charge of them as long\r\nas the mother turkey would have done. Goslings would suffer less from\r\nsuch untimely desertion.\r\n\r\nTHE PHEASANT MALAY. This variety is highly valued by many, not on\r\naccount of its intrinsic merits, which are considerable, but because it\r\nis believed to be a cross between the pheasant and the common fowl. This\r\nis, however, an erroneous opinion. Hybrids between the pheasant and the\r\nfowl are, for the most part, absolutely sterile; when they do breed, it\r\nis not with each other, but with the stock of one of their progenitors;\r\nand the offspring of these either fail or assimilate to one or the other\r\noriginal type. No half-bred family is perpetuated, no new breed created,\r\nby human or volucrine agency.\r\n\r\nThe Pheasant Malays are large, well-flavored, good sitters, good layers,\r\ngood mothers, and, in many points, an ornamental and desirable stock.\r\nSome object to them as being a trifle too long in their make; but they\r\nhave a healthy look of not being over-bred, which is a recommendation to\r\nthose who rear for profit as well as pleasure. The eggs vary in size;\r\nsome are very large in summer, smooth, but not polished, sometimes\r\ntinged with light buff, balloon-shaped, and without the zone of\r\nirregularity. The chickens, when first hatched, are all very much alike;\r\nyellow, with a black mark all down the back. The cock has a black tail,\r\nwith black on the neck and wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLYMOUTH ROCK.\r\n\r\nThis name has been given to a very good breed of fowls, produced by\r\ncrossing a China cock with a hen, a cross between the Fawn-colored\r\nDorking, the Great Malay, and the Wild Indian.\r\n\r\nAt a little over a year old, the cocks stand from thirty-two to\r\nthirty-five inches high, and weigh about ten pounds; and the pullets\r\nfrom six and a half to seven pounds each. The latter commence laying\r\nwhen five months old, and prove themselves very superior layers. Their\r\neggs are of a medium size, rich, and reddish-yellow in color. Their\r\nplumage is rich and variegated; the cocks usually red or speckled, and\r\nthe pullets darkish brown. They have very fine flesh, and are fit for\r\nthe table at an early age. The legs are very large, and usually blue or\r\ngreen, but occasionally yellow or white, generally having five toes upon\r\neach foot. Some have their legs feathered, but this is not usual. They\r\nhave large and single combs and wattles, large cheeks, rather short\r\ntails, and small wings in proportion to their bodies.\r\n\r\nThey are domestic, and not so destructive to gardens as smaller fowls.\r\nThere is the same uniformity in size and general appearance, at the same\r\nage of the chickens, as in those of the pure bloods of primary races.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POLAND.\r\n\r\nThe Poland, or Polish fowl, is quite unknown in the country which would\r\nseem to have suggested the name, which originated from some fancied\r\nresemblance between its tufted crest and the square-spreading crown of\r\nthe feathered caps worn by the Polish soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe breed of crested fowls is much esteemed by the curious, and is\r\nbred with great care. Those desirous of propagating any singular\r\nvarieties, separate and confine the individuals, and do not suffer them\r\nto mingle with such as have the colors different. The varieties are more\r\nesteemed in proportion to the variety of the colors, or the contrast of\r\nthe tuft with the rest of the plumage. Although the differences of\r\nplumage are thus preserved pretty constant, they seem to owe their\r\norigin to the same breed, and cannot be reproduced pure without careful\r\nsuperintendence. The cocks are much esteemed in Egypt, in consequence of\r\nthe excellence of their flesh, and are so common that they are sold at\r\na remarkably cheap rate. They are equally abundant at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, where their legs are feathered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POLAND FOWLS.]\r\n\r\nThe Polish are chiefly suited for keeping in a small way, and in a clean\r\nand grassy place. They are certainly not so fit for the farm-yard, as\r\nthey become blinded and miserable with dirt. Care should be exercised to\r\nprocure them genuine, since there is no breed of fowls more disfigured\r\nby mongrelism than this. They will, without any cross-breeding,\r\noccasionally produce white stock that are very pretty, and equally good\r\nfor laying. If, however, an attempt is made to establish a separate\r\nbreed of them, they become puny and weak. It is, therefore, better for\r\nthose who wish for them to depend upon chance; every brood almost of the\r\nblack produces one white chicken, as strong and lively as the rest.\r\n\r\nThese fowls are excellent for the table, the flesh being white, tender,\r\nand juicy; but they are quite unsuitable for being reared in any\r\nnumbers, or for general purposes, since they are so capricious in their\r\ngrowth, frequently remaining stationary in this respect for a whole\r\nmonth, getting no larger; and this, too, when they are about a quarter\r\nor half grown--the time of their life when they are most liable to\r\ndisease. As aviary birds, they are unrivalled among fowls. Their plumage\r\noften requires a close inspection to appreciate its elaborate beauty;\r\nthe confinement and fretting seem not uncongenial to their health; and\r\ntheir plumage improves in attractiveness with almost every month.\r\n\r\nThe great merit, however, of all the Polish fowls is, that for three or\r\nfour years they continue to grow and gain in size, hardiness, and\r\nbeauty--the male birds especially. This fact certainly points out a very\r\nwide deviation in constitution from those fowls which attain their full\r\nstature and perfect plumage in twelve or fifteen months. The similarity\r\nof coloring in the two sexes--almost a specific distinction of Polish\r\nand perhaps Spanish fowls--also separates them from those breeds, like\r\nthe Game, in which the cocks and hens are remarkably dissimilar. Their\r\nedible qualities are as superior, compared with other fowls, as their\r\noutward apparel surpasses in elegance. They have also the reputation of\r\nbeing everlasting layers, which further fits them for keeping in small\r\nenclosures; but, in this respect, individual exceptions are often\r\nencountered--as in the case of the Hamburghs--however truly the habit\r\nmay be ascribed to the race.\r\n\r\nThere are four known varieties of the Polish fowl, one of which appears\r\nto be lost to this country.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK POLISH. This variety is of a uniform black--both cock and\r\nhen--glossed with metallic green. The head is ornamented with a handsome\r\ncrest of white feathers, springing from a fleshy protuberance, and\r\nfronted more or less deeply with black. The comb is merely two or three\r\nspikes, and the wattles are rather small. Both male and female are the\r\nsame in color, except that the former has frequently narrow stripes of\r\nwhite in the waving feathers of the tail, a sign, it is said, of true\r\nbreeding. The hens, also, have two or three feathers on each side of the\r\ntail, tinged in the tip with white. They do not lay quite so early in\r\nthe spring as some varieties, especially after a hard winter; but they\r\nare exceedingly good layers, continuing a long time without wanting to\r\nsit, and laying rather large, very white, sub-ovate eggs. They will,\r\nhowever, sit at length, and prove of very diverse dispositions; some\r\nbeing excellent sitters and nurses, others heedless and spiteful.\r\n\r\nThe chickens, when first hatched, are dull black, with white breasts,\r\nand white down on the front of the head. They do not always grow and get\r\nout of harm's way so quickly as some other sorts, but are not\r\nparticularly tender. In rearing a brood of these fowls, some of the hens\r\nmay be observed with crests round and symmetrical as a ball, and others\r\nin which the feathers turn all ways, and fall loosely over the eyes; and\r\nin the cocks, also, some have the crest falling gracefully over the back\r\nof the head, and others have the feathers turning about and standing on\r\nend. These should be rejected, the chief beauty of the kind depending\r\nupon such little particulars. One hen of this variety laid just a\r\nhundred eggs, many of them on consecutive days, before wanting to\r\nincubate; and after rearing a brood successfully, she laid twenty-five\r\neggs before moulting in autumn.\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN POLANDS. These are sometimes called Gold Spangled, as their\r\nplumage approaches to that of the Gold Spangled Hamburghs; but many of\r\nthe finest specimens have the feathers merely fringed with a darker\r\ncolor, and the cocks, more frequently than the hens, exhibit a spotted\r\nor spangled appearance. Many of them are disfigured by a muff or beard;\r\nas to which the question has been raised whether it is an original\r\nappendage to these birds or not. A distinct race, of which the muff is\r\none permanent characteristic, is not at present known. This appendage,\r\nwhenever introduced into the poultry-yard, is not easily got rid of;\r\nwhich has caused some to suspect either that the original Polish were\r\nbeardless, or that there were two ancient races.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Polands, when well-bred, are exceedingly handsome; the cock\r\nhas golden hackles, and gold and brown feathers on the back; breast and\r\nwings richly spotted with ochre and dark brown; tail darker; large\r\ngolden and brown crest, falling back over the neck; but little comb and\r\nwattles. The hen is richly laced with dark-brown or black on an ochre\r\nground; dark-spotted crest; legs light-blue, very cleanly made, and\r\ndisplaying a small web between the toes, almost as proportionately large\r\nas that in some of the waders.\r\n\r\nThey are good layers, and produce fair-sized eggs. Many of them make\r\nexcellent mothers, although they cannot be induced to sit early in the\r\nseason. The chickens are rather clumsy-looking little creatures, of a\r\ndingy-brown, with some dashes of ochre about the head, breast and wings.\r\nThey are sometimes inclined to disease in the first week of their\r\nexistence; but, if they pass this successfully, they become tolerably\r\nhardy, though liable to come to a pause when about half-grown. It may be\r\nnoted as a peculiarity in the temper of this breed, that, if one is\r\ncaught, or attacked by any animal, the rest, whether cocks or hens, will\r\ninstantly make a furious attack upon the aggressor, and endeavor to\r\neffect the rescue of their companion.\r\n\r\nTHE SILVER POLANDS. These are similar to the preceding in shape and\r\nmarkings, except that white, black, and gray are exchanged for ochre or\r\nyellow, and various shades of brown. They are even more delicate in\r\ntheir constitution, more liable to remain stationary at a certain point\r\nof their adolescence, and, still more than the other varieties, require\r\nand will repay extra care and accommodation. Their top-knots are,\r\nperhaps, not so large, as a general thing; but they retain the same neat\r\nbluish legs and slightly-webbed feet. The hens are much more ornamental\r\nthan the cocks; though the latter are sure to attract notice. They may,\r\nunquestionably, be ranked among the choicest of fowls, whether their\r\nbeauty or their rarity is considered. They lay, in tolerable abundance,\r\neggs of moderate size, French-white, much pointed at one end; and when\r\nthey sit, acquit themselves respectably.\r\n\r\nThe newly-hatched chickens are very pretty; gray, with black eyes, light\r\nlead-colored legs, and a swelling of down on the crown of the head,\r\nindicative of the future top-knot, which is exactly the color of a\r\npowdered wig, and, indeed, gives the chicken the appearance of wearing\r\none. There is no difficulty in rearing them for the first six weeks or\r\ntwo months; the critical time being the interval between that age and\r\ntheir reaching the fifth or sixth month. They acquire their peculiar\r\ndistinctive features at a very early age, and are then the most elegant\r\nlittle miniature fowls which can possibly be imagined. The distinction\r\nof sex is not very manifest till they are nearly full-grown; the first\r\nobservable indication being in the tail. That of the pullet is carried\r\nuprightly, as it ought to be; but in the cockerel, it remains depressed,\r\nawaiting the growth of the sickle-feathers. The top-knot of the cockerel\r\ninclines to hang more backward than that of the pullets. It is\r\nremarkable that the Golden Polish cock produces as true Silver chickens,\r\nand those stronger, with the Silver Polish hen, as the Silver Polish\r\ncock would bring.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Polands have all the habits of their golden companions, the\r\nmain difference being the silvery ground instead of the golden. This\r\nvariety will sometimes make its appearance even if merely its Golden\r\nkind is bred, precisely as the Black Polish now and then produce some\r\npure White chickens that make very elegant birds.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK-TOPPED WHITE. This variety does not at present exist among us;\r\nand some have even questioned whether it ever did. Buffon mentions them\r\nas if extant in France in his time. An attempt has been made to obtain\r\nthem from the preceding, by acting on the imagination of the parents.\r\nThe experiment failed, though similar schemes are said to have succeeded\r\nwith animals; it proved, however, that it will not do to breed from the\r\nWhite Polish as a separate breed. Being Albinos, the chickens come very\r\nweakly, and few survive.\r\n\r\nThis breed is now recoverable, probably, only by importation from Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHANGHAE.\r\n\r\nFor all the purposes of a really good fowl--for beauty of model, good\r\nsize, and laying qualities--the thorough-bred Shanghae is among the\r\nbest, and generally the most profitable of domestic birds. The cock,\r\nwhen full-grown, stands about twenty-eight inches high, if he is a good\r\nspecimen; the female, about twenty-two or twenty-three inches. A large\r\ncomb or heavy wattles are rarely seen on the hen at any age; but the\r\ncomb of the male is high, deeply indented, and his wattles double and\r\nlarge. The comb and wattles are not, however, to be regarded as the\r\nchief characteristics of this variety, nor even its reddish-yellow\r\nfeathered leg; but the abundant, soft, and downy covering of the thighs,\r\nhips, and region of the vent, together with the remarkably short tail,\r\nand large mound of feathers piled over the upper part of its root,\r\ngiving rise to a considerable elevation on that part of the rump. It\r\nshould be remarked, also, that the wings are quite short and small in\r\nproportion to the size of the fowl, and carried very high up the body,\r\nthus exposing the whole of the thighs, and a considerable portion of the\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHANGHAES.]\r\n\r\nThese characteristics are not found, in the same degree, in any other\r\nfowl. The peculiar arrangement of feathers gives the Shanghae in\r\nappearance, what it has in reality--a greater depth of quarter, in\r\nproportion to the brisket, than any other fowl.\r\n\r\nAs to the legs, they are not very peculiar. The color is usually\r\nreddish-white, or flesh-color, or reddish-yellow, mostly covered down\r\nthe outside, even to the end of the toes, with feathers. This last,\r\nhowever, is not always the case. The plumage of the thorough-bred is\r\nremarkably soft and silky, or rather downy; and is, in the opinion of\r\nmany, equally as good for domestic purposes as that of the goose. The\r\nfeathers are certainly quite as fine and soft, if not as abundant.\r\n\r\nIn laying qualities, the pure Shanghae equals, if it does not excel, any\r\nother fowl. The Black Poland, or the Bolton Gray, may, perhaps, lay a\r\nfew more eggs in the course of a year, in consequence of not so\r\nfrequently inclining to sit; but their eggs are not so rich and\r\nnutritious. A pullet of this breed laid one hundred and twenty eggs in\r\none hundred and twenty-five days, then stopped six days, then laid\r\nsixteen eggs more, stopped four days, and again continued her laying.\r\nThe eggs are generally of a pale yellow, or nankeen color, not\r\nremarkably large, compared with the size of the fowl, and generally\r\nblunt at the ends. The comb is commonly single, though, in some\r\nspecimens, there is a slight tendency to rose.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this fowl is tender, juicy, and unexceptionable in\r\nevery respect. Taking into consideration the goodly size of the\r\nShanghae--weighing, as the males do, at maturity, from ten to twelve\r\npounds, and the females from seven and a half to eight and a half,\r\nand the males and females of six months, eight and six pounds\r\nrespectively--the economical uses to which its soft, downy feathers may\r\nbe applied, its productiveness, hardiness, and its quiet and docile\r\ntemper, this variety must occupy, and deservedly so, a high rank among\r\nour domestic fowls; and the more it is known, the better will it be\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE SHANGHAE. This variety is entirely white, with the legs\r\nusually feathered, and differ in no material respect from the red,\r\nyellow, and Dominique, except in color. The legs are yellowish, or\r\nreddish-yellow, and sometimes of flesh-color. Many prefer them to all\r\nothers. The eggs are of a nankeen, or dull yellow color, and blunt at\r\nboth ends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHITE SHANGHAES.]\r\n\r\nIt is claimed by the friends of this variety that they are larger and\r\nmore quiet than other varieties, that their flesh is much superior,\r\ntheir eggs larger, and the hens more profitable. Being more quiet in\r\ntheir habits, and less inclined to ramble, the hens are invaluable as\r\nincubators and nurses; and the mildness of their disposition makes them\r\nexcellent foster-mothers, as they never injure the chickens belonging to\r\nother hens.\r\n\r\nThese fowls will rank among the largest coming from China, and are very\r\nthrifty in our climate. A cock of this variety attained a weight of\r\neight pounds, at about the age of eight months, and the pullets of the\r\nsame brood were proportionably large. They are broad on the back and\r\nbreast, with a body well rounded up; the plumage white, with a downy\r\nsoftness--in the latter respect much like the feathering of the Bremen\r\ngoose; the tail-feathers short and full; the head small, surmounted by a\r\nsmall, single, serrated comb; wattles long and wide, overlaying the\r\ncheek-piece, which is also large, and extends back on the neck; and the\r\nlegs of a yellow hue, approaching a flesh-color, and feathered to the\r\nends of the toes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SILVER PHEASANT.\r\n\r\nThis variety of fowls is remarkable for great brilliancy of plumage and\r\ndiversity of colors. On a white ground, which is usually termed silvery,\r\nthere is an abundance of black spots. The feathers on the upper part of\r\nthe head are much longer than the rest, and unite together in a tuft.\r\nThey have a small, double comb, and their wattles are also comparatively\r\nsmall. A remarkable peculiarity of the cock is, that there is a spot of\r\na blue color on the cheeks, and a range of feathers under the throat,\r\nwhich has the appearance of a collar.\r\n\r\nThe hen is a smaller bird, with plumage similar to that of the cock, and\r\nat a little distance seems to be covered with scales. On the head is a\r\ntop-knot of very large size, which droops over it on every side. The\r\nSilver Pheasants are beautiful and showy birds, and chiefly valuable as\r\nornamental appendages to the poultry-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANISH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPANISH FOWLS.]\r\n\r\nThis name is said to be a misnomer, as the breed in question was\r\noriginally brought by the Spaniards from the West Indies; and, although\r\nsubsequently propagated in Spain, it has for some time been very\r\ndifficult to procure good specimens from that country. From Spain, they\r\nwere taken in considerable numbers into Holland, where they have been\r\ncarefully bred, for many years; and it is from that quarter that our\r\nbest fowls of this variety come.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish is a noble race of fowls, possessing many merits; of\r\nspirited and animated appearance; of considerable size; excellent for\r\nthe table, both in whiteness of flesh and skin, and also in flavor; and\r\nlaying exceedingly large eggs in considerable numbers. Among birds of\r\nits own breed it is not deficient in courage; though it yields, without\r\nshowing much fight, to those which have a dash of game blood in their\r\nveins. It is a general favorite in all large cities, for the additional\r\nadvantage that no soil of smoke or dirt is apparent on its plumage.\r\n\r\nThe thorough-bred birds should be entirely black, as far as feathers are\r\nconcerned; and when in high condition, display a greenish, metallic\r\nlustre. The combs of both cock and hen are exceedingly large, of a vivid\r\nand most brilliant scarlet; that of the hen droops over upon one side.\r\nTheir most singular feature is a large, white patch, or ear-hole, on the\r\ncheek--in some specimens extending over a great part of the face--of a\r\nfleshy substance, similar to the wattle; it is small in the female, but\r\nlarge and very conspicuous in the male. This marked contrast of black,\r\nbright red, and white, makes the breed of the Spanish cock as handsome\r\nas that of any variety which we have; in the genuine breed, the whole\r\nform is equally good.\r\n\r\nSpanish hens are celebrated as good layers, and produce very large,\r\nquite white eggs, of a peculiar shape, being very thick at both ends,\r\nand yet tapering off a little at each. They are, by no means, good\r\nmothers of families, even when they do sit--which they will not often\r\ncondescend to do--proving very careless, and frequently trampling half\r\ntheir brood under foot. The inconveniences of this habit are, however,\r\neasily obviated by causing the eggs to be hatched by some more motherly\r\nhen.\r\n\r\nThis variety of fowl has frequently been known to lose nearly all the\r\nfeathers in its body, besides the usual quantity on the neck, wings, and\r\ntail; and, if they moult late, and the weather is severe, they feel it\r\nmuch. This must often happen in the case of an \"everlasting layer;\" for\r\nif the system of a bird is exhausted by the unremitting production of\r\neggs, it cannot contain within itself the material for supplying the\r\ngrowth of feathers. They have not, even yet, become acclimated in this\r\ncountry, since continued frost at any time is productive of much injury\r\nto their combs; frequently causing mortification in the end, which at\r\ntimes terminates in death. A warm poultry-house, high feeding, and care\r\nthat they do not remain too long exposed to severe weather, are the best\r\nmeans of preventing this disfigurement. Some birds are occasionally\r\nproduced, handsomely streaked with red on the hackle and back. This is\r\nno proof of bad breeding, if other points are right.\r\n\r\nThe chickens are large, as would be expected from such eggs, entirely\r\nshining black, except a pinafore of white on the breast--in which\r\nrespect they are precisely like the Black Polish chickens--and a slight\r\nsprinkling under the chin, with sometimes also a little white round the\r\nback and eyes; their legs and feet are black. Many of them do not get\r\nperfectly feathered till they are three-fourths grown; and, therefore,\r\nto have this variety come to perfection in a country where the summers\r\nare much shorter than in their native climate, they must be hatched\r\nearly in spring, so that they may be well covered with plumage before\r\nthe cold rains of autumn. There is, however, a great lack of uniformity\r\nin the time when they get their plumage; the pullets are always earlier\r\nand better feathered than the cockerels--the latter being generally half\r\nnaked for a considerable time after being hatched, though some feather\r\ntolerably well at an early age.\r\n\r\nThe _Black_ is not the only valuable race of Spanish fowl; there is,\r\nalso, the _Gray_, or _Speckled_, of a slaty gray color, with white legs.\r\nTheir growth is so rapid, and their size, eventually, so large, that\r\nthey are remarkably slow in obtaining their feathers. Although well\r\ncovered with down when first hatched, they look almost naked when\r\nhalf-grown, and should, therefore, be hatched as early in spring as\r\npossible. The cross between the Pheasant-Malay and the Spanish produces\r\na particularly handsome fowl.\r\n\r\nAs early pullets, for laying purposes in the autumn and winter after\r\nthey are hatched, no fowls can surpass the Spanish. They are believed,\r\nalso, to be more precocious in their constitution; and consequently to\r\nlay at an earlier age than the pullets of other breeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL HISTORY OF DOMESTIC FOWLS.\r\n\r\nFowls are classed by modern naturalists as follows:\r\n\r\n  DIVISION.   _Vertebrata_--possessing a back bone.\r\n  CLASS.   _Aves_--birds.\r\n  ORDER.   _Rasores_--scrapers.\r\n  FAMILY.   _Phasianidae_--Pheasants.\r\n  GENUS.   _Gallus_--the cock.\r\n\r\nBirds, as well as quadrupeds, may be divided into two great classes,\r\naccording to their food: the Carnivorous and the Graminivorous. Fowls\r\nbelong, strictly speaking, to the latter.\r\n\r\nIn the structure of the _digestive organs_, birds exhibit a great\r\nuniformity. The [oe]sophagus, which is often very muscular, is\r\ndilated into a large sac--called the _crop_--at its entrance into\r\nthe breast; this is abundantly supplied with glands, and serves as a\r\nspecies of first stomach, in which the food receives a certain amount\r\nof preparation before being submitted to the action of the proper\r\ndigestive organs. A little below the crop, the narrow [oe]sophagus is\r\nagain slightly dilated, forming what is called the _ventriculus\r\nsuccenturiatus_, the walls of which are very thick, and contain a great\r\nnumber of glands, which secrete the gastric juice. Below this, the\r\nintestinal canal is enlarged into a third stomach, the _gizzard_, in\r\nwhich the process of digestion is carried still farther. In the\r\ngraminivorous birds, the walls of this cavity are very thick and\r\nmuscular, and clothed internally with a strong, horny _epithelium_,\r\nserving for the trituration of the food. The intestine is rather short,\r\nbut usually exhibits several convolutions; the large intestine is always\r\nfurnished with two _corea_. It opens by a semicircular orifice into the\r\n_cloaca_, which also receives the orifices of the urinary and generative\r\norgans. The liver is of large size, and usually furnished with a\r\ngall-bladder. The pancreas is lodged in a kind of loop, formed by the\r\nsmall intestine immediately after quitting the gizzard. There are also\r\nlarge salivary glands in the neighborhood of the mouth, which pour their\r\nsecretion into that cavity.\r\n\r\nThe _organs of circulation and respiration_ in birds are adapted to\r\ntheir peculiar mode of life; but are not separated from the abdominal\r\ncavity by a diaphragm, as in the mammalia. The heart consists of four\r\ncavities distinctly separated--two auricles and two ventricles--so that\r\nthe venous and arterial blood can never mix in that organ; and the\r\nwhole of the blood returned from the different parts of the body passes\r\nthrough the lungs before being again driven into the systemic arteries.\r\nThe blood is received from the veins of the body in the right auricle,\r\nfrom which it passes through a tabular opening into the right ventricle,\r\nand is thence driven into the lungs. From these organs it returns\r\nthrough the pulmonary veins into the left auricle, and passes thence\r\ninto the ventricles of the same side, by the contraction of which it is\r\ndriven into the aorta. This soon divides into two branches, which, by\r\ntheir subdivision, give rise to the arteries of the body.\r\n\r\n_The jaws_, or mandibles, are sheathed in a horny case, usually of a\r\nconical form, on the sides of which are the nostrils. In most birds, the\r\nsides of this sheath or bill are smooth and sharp; but in some they are\r\ndenticulated along the margins. The two anterior members of the body are\r\nextended into wings. The beak is used instead of hands; and such is the\r\nflexibility of the vertebral column, that the bird is able to touch with\r\nits beak every part of its body. This curious and important result is\r\nobtained chiefly by the lengthened vertebrae of the neck, which, in the\r\nswan, consists of twenty-three bones, and in the domestic cock,\r\nthirteen. The vertebrae of the back are seven to eleven; the ribs never\r\nexceed ten on each side.\r\n\r\nThe clothing of the skin consists of _feathers_, which in their nature\r\nand development resemble hair, but are of a more complicated structure.\r\nA perfect feather consists of the _shaft_, a central stem, which is\r\ntubular at the base, where it is inserted into the skin, and the\r\n_barbs_, or fibres, which form the _webs_ on each side of the shaft. The\r\ntwo principal modifications of feathers are _quills_ and _plumes_; the\r\nformer confined to the wings and tail, the latter constituting the\r\ngeneral clothing of the body. Besides the common feathers, the skin of\r\nmany birds is covered with a thick coating of down, which consists of a\r\nmultitude of small feathers of peculiar construction; each of these down\r\nfeathers is composed of a very small, soft tube imbedded in the skin,\r\nfrom the interior of which there rises a small tuft of soft filaments,\r\nwithout any central shaft. These filaments are very slender, and bear on\r\neach side a series of still more delicate filaments, which may be\r\nregarded as analogous to the barbules of the ordinary feathers. This\r\ndowny coat fulfils the same office as the soft, woolly fur of many\r\nquadrupeds; the ordinary feathers being analogous to the long, smooth\r\nhair by which the fur of these animals is concealed. The skin also bears\r\nmany hair-like appendages, which are usually scattered sparingly over\r\nits surface; they rise from a bulb which is imbedded in the skin, and\r\nusually indicate their relation to the ordinary feathers by the presence\r\nof a few minute barbs toward the apex.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice in the course of a year the whole plumage of the bird is\r\nrenewed, the casting of the old feathers being called _moulting_. The\r\nbase of the quills is covered by a series of large feathers, called the\r\n_wing coverts_; and the feathers of the tail are furnished with numerous\r\nmuscles, by which they can be spread out and folded up like a fan. In\r\nthe aquatic birds--like the goose, the duck, and the swan--the feathers\r\nare constantly lubricated by an oily secretion, which completely\r\nexcludes the water.\r\n\r\nIn their reproduction, birds are strictly oviparous. The _eggs_ are\r\nalways enclosed in a hard shell, consisting of calcareous matter, and\r\nbirds almost invariably devote their whole attention, during the\r\nbreeding season, to the hatching of their eggs and the development of\r\ntheir offspring; sitting constantly upon the eggs to communicate to them\r\nthe degree of warmth necessary for the evolution of the embryo, and\r\nattending to the wants of their newly-hatched young, until the latter\r\nare in a condition to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the structure and development of the egg there is a great uniformity;\r\nbut there is a remarkable difference in the condition of the young bird\r\nat the moment of hatching. In the class under consideration, the young\r\nare able to run about from the moment of their breaking the egg-shell;\r\nand the only care of the parents is devoted to protecting their\r\noffspring from danger, and leading them into those places where they are\r\nlikely to meet with food.\r\n\r\nThe _longevity_ of birds is various, and, unlike the case of men and\r\nquadrupeds, seems to bear little proportion to the age at which they\r\nacquire maturity. A few months, or even a few weeks, suffice to bring\r\nthem to their perfection of stature, instincts, and powers. Domestic\r\nfowls live to the age of twenty years; geese, fifty; while swans exceed\r\na century.\r\n\r\nThe order _Rasores_ includes the numerous species of _gallinaceous\r\nbirds_, and the term is applied to them from their habit of scratching\r\nin the ground in search of food. They are generally marked by a small\r\nhead, stout legs, plumage fine, the males usually adorned with\r\nmagnificent colors, and the tails often developed in a manner to render\r\nthe appearance extremely elegant. The wings are usually short and weak,\r\nand the flight of the birds is neither powerful nor prolonged. The\r\n_corla_ of this order are larger than in any other birds.\r\n\r\nThe species are found in almost all parts of the world, from the tropics\r\nto the frozen regions of the north; but the finest and most typical\r\nkinds are inhabitants of the temperate and warmer parts of Asia. They\r\nfeed principally on seeds, fruit, and herbage, but also, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, on insects, worms, and other small animals. Their\r\ngeneral habitation is on the ground, where they run with great celerity,\r\nbut many of them roost on trees. They are mostly polygamous in their\r\nhabits, the males being usually surrounded by a considerable troop of\r\nfemales; and to these, with a few exceptions, the whole business of\r\nincubation is generally left. The nest is always placed on the ground in\r\nsome sheltered situation, and very little art is exhibited in its\r\nconstruction; indeed, an elaborate nest is the less necessary, as the\r\nyoung are able to run about and feed almost as soon as they have left\r\nthe egg; and at night or on the approach of danger, they collect beneath\r\nthe wings of their mother. Most of these species are esteemed for the\r\ntable, and many of them are among the most celebrated of game birds.\r\n\r\nThe _pheasant family_, of this order, includes the most beautiful of the\r\nrasorial birds; indeed, some of them may, perhaps, be justly regarded as\r\npre-eminent in this respect over all the rest of their class. In these,\r\nthe bill is of moderate size and compressed, with the upper mandible\r\narched to the tip, where it overhangs the lower one; the _tarsi_ are of\r\nmoderate length and thickness, usually armed with one or two spurs; the\r\ntoes are moderate, and the hinder one short and elevated; the wings are\r\nrather short and rounded, and the tail more or less elongated and\r\nbroad, but frequently wedge-shaped and pointed. The head is rarely\r\nfeathered all over; the naked skin is sometimes confined to a space\r\nabout the eye, but generally occupies a greater portion of the surface,\r\noccasionally covering the whole head, and even a part of the neck, and\r\nfrequently forming combs and wattles of very remarkable forms. In some\r\nspecies, the crown is furnished with a crest of feathers.\r\n\r\nThe birds of this family are, for the most part, indigenous to the\r\nAsiatic continent and islands, from which, however, several species have\r\nbeen introduced into other parts of the globe. The Guinea Fowl of\r\nAfrica, and the Turkeys of America, are almost the only instances of\r\nwild Phasianidous birds out of Asia. Some species, such as the Domestic\r\nFowl, the Peacock, the Turkey, and the Guinea Fowl, have been reduced to\r\na state of complete domestication, and are distributed pretty generally\r\nover the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GUINEA FOWL.\r\n\r\nThis bird belongs to the same division, class, order, and family as the\r\nDomestic Fowl; but is assigned by naturalists to the genus Numida, or\r\nNumidian. It is indigenous to the tropical parts of Africa, and in a\r\nwild state, Guinea Fowls live in flocks, in woods, preferring marshy\r\nplaces, and feed on insects, worms, and seeds; they roost on trees; the\r\nnest is made on the ground, and usually contains as many as twenty eggs.\r\nThey have been propagated in the Island of Jamaica to such an extent as\r\nto have become wild, and are shot like other game. They do much damage\r\nto the crops, and are therefore destroyed by various means; one of which\r\nis, to get them tipsy by strewing corn steeped in rum, and mixed with\r\nthe intoxicating juice of the cassava, upon the ground; the birds\r\ndevour this, and are soon found in a helpless state of inebriety.\r\n\r\nThe Guinea Fowl, to a certain degree, unites the characteristics of the\r\npheasant and the turkey; having the delicate shape of the one, and the\r\nbare head of the other. There are several varieties: the White, the\r\nSpotted, the Madagascar, and the Crested. The latter is not so large as\r\nthe common species; the head and neck are bare, of a dull blue, shaded\r\nwith red, and, instead of the casque, it has an ample crest of\r\nhair-like, disunited feathers, of a bluish black, reaching as far\r\nforward as the nostrils, but, in general, turned backward. The whole\r\nplumage, except the quills, is of a bluish black, covered with small\r\ngrayish spots, sometimes four, sometimes six on each feather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GUINEA FOWL.]\r\n\r\nThis fowl is not a great favorite among many keepers of poultry, being\r\nso unfortunate as to have gained a much worse reputation than it really\r\ndeserves, from having been occasionally guilty of a few trifling faults.\r\nIt is, however, useful, ornamental, and interesting during its life;\r\nand, when dead, a desirable addition to the table, at a time when all\r\nother poultry is scarce.\r\n\r\nThe best way to commence keeping Guineas is to procure a sitting of eggs\r\nwhich can be depended upon for freshness, and if possible, from a place\r\nwhere but a single pair is kept. A Bantam hen is the best mother; she is\r\nlighter, and less likely to injure them by treading on them than a\r\nfull-sized fowl. She will cover nine eggs, and incubation will last a\r\nmonth. The young are excessively pretty. When first hatched, they are so\r\nstrong and active as to appear not to require the attention which is\r\nreally necessary to rear them. Almost as soon as they are dry from the\r\nmoisture of the egg, they will peck each other's toes, as if supposing\r\nthem to be worms, scramble with each other for a crumb of bread, and\r\ndomineer over any little Bantam or chicken that may chance to have been\r\nhatched at the same time with themselves. No one, ignorant of the fact,\r\nwould guess, from their appearance, to what species of bird they\r\nbelonged; their orange-red bills and legs, and the dark, zebra-like\r\nstripes with which they are regularly marked from head to tail, bear no\r\ntraces of the speckled plumage of their parents.\r\n\r\nOf all known birds, the Guinea fowl is, perhaps, the most prolific of\r\neggs. Week after week, and month after month, there are very few\r\nintermissions, if any, of the daily deposit. Even the process of\r\nmoulting is sometimes insufficient to draw off the nutriment which it\r\ntakes to make feathers instead of eggs; and the poor thing will\r\nsometimes go about half-naked in the chilly autumn months, unable to\r\nrefrain from its diurnal visit to the nest, and consequently unable to\r\nfurnish itself with a new outer garment. The body of the Guinea hen may\r\nbe regarded, in fact, as a most admirable machine for producing eggs\r\nout of insects, grain, and vegetables, garbage, or whatever material an\r\nomnivorous creature can appropriate.\r\n\r\nIts normal plumage is singularly beautiful, being spangled over with an\r\ninfinity of white spots on a black ground, shaded with gray and brown.\r\nThe spots vary from the size of a pea to extreme minuteness. The black\r\nand white occasionally change places, causing the bird to appear covered\r\nwith a net of lace.\r\n\r\nThe white variety is not uncommon, and is said to be equally hardy and\r\nprofitable with the usual kind; but the peculiar beauty of the original\r\nplumage is, certainly, all exchanged for a dress of not the purest\r\nwhite. It is doubtful how long either this or the former variety would\r\nremain permanent; though, probably, but for a few generations. Pied\r\nbirds blotched with patches of white, are frequent, but are not\r\ncomparable, in point of beauty, with those of the original wild color.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEA FOWL.\r\n\r\nThis bird is assigned to the genus _paro_, or peacock--the division,\r\nclass, or sex, and family, being the same as the preceding. The male of\r\nthis species is noted for its long, lustrous tail, which it occasionally\r\nspreads, glittering with hundreds of jewel-like eye-spots, producing an\r\nunrivalled effect of grace and beauty. The form of the bird is also\r\nexceedingly elegant, and the general plumage of the body exhibits rich\r\nmetallic tints; that of the neck, particularly, being of a fine deep\r\nblue, tinged with golden green. The female, however, is of a much more\r\nsober hue, her whole plumage being usually of a brownish color. The\r\nvoice of the peacock is by no means suitable to the beauty of its\r\nexternal appearance, consisting of a harsh, disagreeable cry, not unlike\r\nthe word _paon_, which is the French name of the bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEA FOWL.]\r\n\r\nAlthough naturalized as a domestic bird in Europe and America, the pea\r\nfowl is a native of India, where it is still found abundantly in a wild\r\nstate; and the wild specimens are said to be more brilliant than those\r\nbred in captivity. The date of its introduction into England is not\r\nknown; but the first peacocks appear to have been brought into Europe by\r\nAlexander the Great, although these birds were among the articles\r\nimported into Judea by the fleets of Solomon. They reached Rome toward\r\nthe end of the republic, and their costliness soon caused them to be\r\nregarded as one of the greatest luxuries of the table, though the\r\nmoderns find them dry and leathery. This, perhaps, as much as the desire\r\nof ostentation, may have induced the extravagance of Vitellius and\r\nHeliogabulus, who introduced dishes composed only of the brains and\r\ntongues of peacocks at their feasts. In Europe, during the middle ages,\r\nthe peacock was still a favorite article in the bill of fare of grand\r\nentertainments, at which it was served with the greatest pomp and\r\nmagnificence. And during the period of chivalry, it was usual for\r\nknights to make vows of enterprise on these occasions, \"before the\r\npeacock and the ladies.\" At present, however, the bird is kept entirely\r\non account of the beauty of its appearance.\r\n\r\nIn a state of nature, pea fowl frequent jungles and wooded localities,\r\nfeeding upon grain, fruits, and insects. They are polygamous, and the\r\nfemales make their nests upon the ground among bushes; the nest is\r\ncomposed of grass, and the number of eggs laid is said to be five or\r\nsix. They roost in high trees, and, even in captivity, their inclination\r\nto get into an elevated position frequently manifests itself; and they\r\nmay often be seen perched upon high walls, or upon the ridges of\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nThe latter characteristic is, indirectly, one reason why many are\r\ndisinclined to keep pea fowl in a domestic state. Their decided\r\ndetermination so to roost prevents such a control being exercised over\r\nthem as would restrain them from mischief, until an eye could be kept on\r\ntheir movements; and, consequently, they commit many depredations upon\r\ngardens, stealing off to their work of plunder at the first dawn, or at\r\nthe most unexpected moments. Their cunning indeed is such that, if\r\nfrequently driven away from the garden at any particular hour of the day\r\nor evening, they will never be found there, after a certain time, at\r\nthat special hour, but will invariably make their inroads at day-break.\r\nMany have tried, as a last resort, to eject them with every mark of\r\nscorn and insult, such as harsh words, the cracking of whips, and the\r\nthrowing of harmless brooms; but they remain incorrigible marauders,\r\nindifferent to this disrespectful usage, and careless of severe rebuke.\r\n\r\nA mansion, therefore, where the fruit and vegetable garden is at a\r\ndistance, is almost the only place where they can be kept without daily\r\nvexation. The injury they do to flowers is comparatively trifling;\r\nthough, like the Guinea-fowl, they are great eaters of buds, cutting\r\nthem out cleanly from the _axillae_ of leaves. They must likewise have a\r\ndusting-hole, which is large and unsightly; but this can be provided for\r\nthem in some nook out of the way; and by feeding and encouragement, they\r\nwill soon be taught to dispose themselves into a pleasing spectacle, at\r\nwhatever point of view may be deemed desirable. No one with a very\r\nlimited range should attempt to keep them at all, unless confined in an\r\naviary. Where they can be kept at large, they should be collected in\r\nconsiderable numbers, that their dazzling effects may be as impressive\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nA wanton destructiveness toward the young of other poultry is also\r\ncharged upon them. Relative to this, however, statements differ; some\r\ncontending that such instances of cruelty constitute the exceptions, and\r\nnot the rule.\r\n\r\nThe hen does not lay till her third summer; but she then seems to have\r\nan instinctive fear of her mate, manifested by the secrecy with which\r\nshe selects the place for her nest; nor, if the eggs are disturbed, will\r\nshe go there again. She lays from four or five to seven. If these are\r\ntaken, she will frequently lay a second time during the summer; and the\r\nplan is recommended to those who are anxious to increase their stock.\r\nShe sits from twenty-seven to twenty-nine days. A common hen will hatch\r\nand rear the young; but the same objection lies against her performing\r\nthat office, except in very fine, long summers, for the pea fowl as for\r\nturkeys--that the young require to be brooded longer than the hen is\r\nconveniently able to do. A turkey will prove a much better foster-mother\r\nin every respect. The peahen should, of course, be permitted to take\r\ncharge of one set of eggs. Even without such assistance, she will be\r\ntolerably successful.\r\n\r\nThe same wise provision of Nature noticed in the case of the Guinea fowl\r\nis evinced in a still greater degree in the little pea chickens. Their\r\nnative jungle--tall, dense, sometimes impervious, swarming with reptile,\r\nquadruped, and even insect, enemies--would be a most dangerous\r\nhabitation for a little tender thing that could merely run and squall.\r\nAccordingly, they escape from the egg with their quill-feathers very\r\nhighly developed. In three days, they will fly up, and perch upon any\r\nthing three feet high; in a fortnight, they will roost on trees, or the\r\ntops of sheds; and in a month or six weeks, they will reach the ridge of\r\na barn, if there are any intermediate low stables or other buildings to\r\nhelp them to mount from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties of the common pea fowl: the _pied_ and the\r\n_white_. The first has irregular patches of white about it, like the\r\npied Guinea fowl, and the remainder of the plumage resembling the\r\noriginal sorts; the white have the ocellated spots on the tail faintly\r\nvisible in certain lights. These last are tender, and much prized by\r\nthose who prefer variety to real beauty. They are occasionally produced\r\nby birds of the common kind, in cases where no intercourse with other\r\nwhite birds can have taken place. In one instance, in the same brood,\r\nwhose parents were both of the usual colors, there were two of the\r\ncommon sort, and one white cock, and one white hen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TURKEY.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD TURKEY. The turkey belongs to the genus _meleagris_, and,\r\nthough now known as a domestic fowl in most civilized countries, was\r\nconfined to America until after the discovery of that country by\r\nColumbus. It was probably introduced into Europe by the Spaniards about\r\nthe year 1530. It was found in the forests of North America, when the\r\ncountry was first settled, from the Isthmus of Darien to Canada, being\r\nthen abundant even in New England; at present, a few are found in the\r\nmountains of Massachusetts, New York, and New Jersey; in the Western and\r\nthe Southwestern States they are still numerous, though constantly\r\ndiminishing before the extending and increasing settlements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WILD TURKEY.]\r\n\r\nThe wild male bird measures about three feet and a half, or nearly four\r\nfeet, in length, and almost six in expanse of the wings, and weighs from\r\nfifteen to forty pounds. The skin of the head is of a bluish color, as\r\nis also the upper part of the neck, and is marked with numerous reddish,\r\nwarty elevations, with a few black hairs scattered here and there. On\r\nthe under part of the neck, the skin hangs down loosely, and forms a\r\nsort of wattle; and from the point where the bill commences, and the\r\nforehead terminates, arises a fleshy protuberance, with a small tuft of\r\nhair at the extremity, which becomes greatly elongated when the bird is\r\nexcited; and at the lower part of the neck is a tuft of black hair,\r\neight or nine inches in length.\r\n\r\nThe feathers are, at the base, of a bright dusky tinge, succeeded by a\r\nbrilliant metallic band, which changes, according to the point whence\r\nthe light falls upon it, to bronze, copper, violet, or purple; and the\r\ntip is formed by a narrow, black, velvety band. This last marking is\r\nabsent from the neck and breast. The color of the tail is brown, mottled\r\nwith black, and crossed with numerous lines of the latter color; near\r\nthe tip is a broad, black band, then a short mottled portion, and then a\r\nbroad band of dingy yellow. The wings are white, banded closely with\r\nblack, and shaded with brownish yellow, which deepens in tint toward the\r\nback. The head is very small, in proportion to the size of the body; the\r\nlegs and feet are strongly made, and furnished with blunt spurs, about\r\nan inch long, and of a dusky reddish color; the bill is reddish, and\r\nbrown-colored at the tip.\r\n\r\nThe female is less in size; her legs are destitute of spurs; her neck\r\nand head are less naked, being furnished with short, dirty, gray\r\nfeathers; the feathers on the back of the neck have brownish tips,\r\nproducing on that part a brown, longitudinal band. She also,\r\nfrequently, but not invariably, wants the tuft of feathers on the\r\nbreast. Her prevailing color is a dusky gray, each feather having a\r\nmetallic band, less brilliant than that of the cock, then a blackish\r\nband, and a grayish fringe. Her whole color is, as usual among birds,\r\nduller than that of the cock; the wing-feathers display the white, and\r\nhave no bands; the tail is similarly colored to that of the cock. When\r\nyoung, the sexes are so much alike that it is not easy to discern the\r\ndifference between them; and the cock acquires his beauty only by\r\ndegrees, his plumage not arriving at perfection until the fourth or\r\nfifth year.\r\n\r\nThe habits of these birds in their native wilds are exceedingly curious.\r\nThe males, called _Gobblers_, associate in parties of from ten to a\r\nhundred, and seek their food apart from the females, which either go\r\nabout singly with their young, at that time about two-thirds grown, or\r\nform troops with other females and their families, sometimes to the\r\nnumber of seventy or eighty. These all avoid the old males, who attack\r\nand destroy the young, whenever they can, by reiterated blows upon the\r\nskull. But all parties travel in the same direction, and on foot, unless\r\nthe dog or the hunter or a river on their line of march compels them to\r\ntake wing. When about to cross a river, they select the highest\r\neminences, that their flight may be more sure, and in such positions\r\nthey sometimes stay for a day or more, as if in consultation. The males\r\nupon such occasions gobble obstreperously, strutting with extraordinary\r\nimportance, as if to animate their companions; and the females and the\r\nyoung assume much of the same pompous manner, and spread their tails as\r\nthey move silently around. Having mounted, at length, to the tops of the\r\nhighest trees, the assembled multitude, at the signal note of their\r\nleader, wing their way to the opposite shore. The old and fat birds,\r\ncontrary to what might be expected, cross without difficulty, even when\r\nthe river is a mile in width; but the wings of the young and the meagre,\r\nand, of course, those of the weak, frequently fail them before they have\r\ncompleted their passage, when they drop in, and are forced to swim for\r\ntheir lives, which they do cleverly enough, spreading their tails for a\r\nsupport, closing their wings, stretching out their necks, and striking\r\nout quickly and strongly with their feet. All, however, do not succeed\r\nin such attempts, and the weaker often perish.\r\n\r\nThe wild turkeys feed on maize, all sorts of berries, fruits, grasses,\r\nand beetles; tadpoles, young frogs, and lizards, are occasionally found\r\nin their crops. The pecan nut is a favorite food, and so is the acorn,\r\non which last they fatten rapidly. About the beginning of October, while\r\nthe mast still hangs on the trees, they gather together in flocks,\r\ndirecting their course to the rich bottom-lands, and are then seen in\r\ngreat numbers on the Ohio and Mississippi. This is the _turkey-month_ of\r\nthe Indians. When they have arrived at the land of abundance, they\r\ndisperse in small, promiscuous flocks of both sexes and every age,\r\ndevouring all the mast as they advance. Thus they pass the autumn and\r\nwinter, becoming comparatively familiar after their journeys, when they\r\nventure near plantations and farm-houses. They have even been known, on\r\nsuch occasions, to enter stables and corn-cribs in quest of food.\r\nNumbers are killed in the winter, and preserved in a frozen state for\r\ndistant markets.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of March is the pairing season, for a short time previous\r\nto which the females separate from their mates, and shun them, though\r\nthe latter pertinaciously follow them, gobbling loudly. The sexes roost\r\napart, but at no great distance, so that when the female utters a call,\r\nevery male within hearing responds, rolling note after note in the most\r\nrapid succession; not as when spreading the tail and strutting near the\r\nhen, but in a voice resembling that of the tame turkey when he hears any\r\nunusual or frequently-repeated noise.\r\n\r\nWhere the turkeys are numerous, the woods, from one end to the other,\r\nsometimes for hundreds of miles, resound with this remarkable voice of\r\ntheir wooing, uttered responsively from their roosting-places. This is\r\ncontinued for about an hour; and, on the rising of the sun, they\r\nsilently descend from their perches, and the males begin to strut for\r\nthe purpose of winning the admiration of their mates.\r\n\r\nIf the call of a female be given from the ground, the males in the\r\nvicinity fly toward the individual, and, whether they perceive her or\r\nnot, erect and spread their tails, throw the head backward, and distend\r\nthe comb and wattles, shout pompously, and rustle their wings and\r\nbody-feathers, at the same moment ejecting a puff of air from the lungs.\r\nWhile thus occupied, they occasionally halt to look out for the female,\r\nand then resume their strutting and puffing, moving with as much\r\nrapidity as the nature of their gait will admit. During this ceremonious\r\napproach, the males often encounter each other, and desperate battles\r\nensue, when the conflict is only terminated by the flight or death of\r\nthe vanquished. The usual fruits of such victories are reaped by the\r\nconqueror, who is followed by one or more females, that roost near him,\r\nif not upon the same tree, until they begin to lay, when their habits\r\nare altered, with the view of saving their eggs, which the male breaks,\r\nif he can get at them. These are usually from nine to fifteen in number,\r\nsometimes twenty, whitish and spotted with brown, like those of the\r\ndomestic bird. The nest consists of a few dried leaves placed on the\r\nground, sometimes on a dry ridge, sometimes on the fallen top of a dead\r\nleafy tree, under a thicket of sumach or briers, or by the side of a\r\nlog. Whenever the female leaves the nest, she covers it with leaves, so\r\nas to screen it from observation. She is a very close sitter, and when\r\nshe has chosen a spot will seldom leave it, on account of its being\r\ndiscovered by a human intruder. Should she find one of her eggs,\r\nhowever, sucked by a snake, or other enemy, she abandons the nest\r\nforever. When the eggs are near hatching, she will not forsake her nest\r\nwhile life remains.\r\n\r\nThe females are particularly attentive to their young, which are very\r\nsensitive to the effects of damp; and consequently wild turkeys are\r\nalways scarce after a rainy season. The flesh of the wild turkey is much\r\nsuperior to that of the domestic bird; yet the flesh of such of the\r\nlatter as have been suffered to roam at large in the woods and in the\r\nplains is, in no respect, improved by this partially wild mode of life.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMESTIC TURKEY.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the popular name, turkey, appears to be the confusion at\r\nfirst unaccountably subsisting relative to the identity of the bird with\r\nthe Guinea fowl, which was still scarce at the time of the introduction\r\nof the turkey. Some, however, say that the name arose from the proud and\r\n_Turkish_ strut of the cock. There is a question whether the domestic\r\nturkey is actually a second and distinct species, or merely a variety of\r\nthe wild bird, owing its diversity of aspect to circumstances dependent\r\non locality, and consequent change of habit, combined with difference of\r\nclimate and other important causes, which are known in the case of other\r\nanimals to produce such remarkable effects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOMESTIC TURKEY.]\r\n\r\nThe _varieties_ of the domesticated turkey are not very distinct; and as\r\nto their relative value, it is, perhaps, difficult to give any decisive\r\nopinion. Some suppose that the _white_ turkey is the most robust, and\r\nmost easily fattened. Experience has, however, shown to the contrary.\r\nThe pure white are very elegant creatures; and though very tender to\r\nrear, are not so much so as the white pea fowl. Most birds, wild as well\r\nas tame, occasionally produce perfectly white individuals, of more\r\ndelicate constitution than their parents. The selection and pairing of\r\nsuch have probably been the means of establishing and keeping up this\r\nbreed. With all care, they will now and then produce speckled birds and\r\nso show a tendency to return to the normal plumage. It is remarkable\r\nthat in specimens which are, in other respects, snow-white, the tuft on\r\nthe breast remains coal-black, appearing, in the hens, like a tail of\r\nermine, and so showing us a great ornament. The head and caruncles on\r\nthe neck of the male are, when excited, of the same blue and scarlet\r\nhues. The bird is truly beautiful, with its snowy and trembling flakes\r\nof plumage thus relieved with small portions of black, blue, and\r\nscarlet. They have one merit--they dress most temptingly white for\r\nmarket; but they are unsuited for mirey, smokey, or clayey situations,\r\nand show and thrive best where they have a range of clean, short\r\npasture, on a light or chalky subsoil.\r\n\r\nThe _bronze_ and _copper-colored_ varieties are generally undersized,\r\nand are among the most difficult of all to rear; but their flesh is,\r\ncertainly, very delicate, and, perhaps, more so than that of other\r\nkinds--a circumstance, however, that may partly result from their far\r\ngreater delicacy of constitution, and the consequent extra trouble\r\ndevoted to their management.\r\n\r\nThe _brown_ and _ashy-gray_ are not particularly remarkable; but the\r\n_black_ are decidedly superior, in every respect, not only as regards\r\ngreater hardiness, and a consequent greater facility of rearing, but as\r\nacquiring flesh more readily, and that, too, of the very best and\r\nprimest quality. Those of this color appear also to be far less removed\r\nthan the others from the original wild stock. Fortunately, the black\r\nseems to be the favorite color of Nature; and black turkeys are produced\r\nfar more abundantly than those of any other hue.\r\n\r\nThe turkey is a most profitable bird, since it can almost wholly provide\r\nfor itself about the roads; snails, slugs, and worms are among the\r\nnumber of its dainties, and the nearest stream serves to slake its\r\nthirst. To the farmer, however, it is often a perfect nuisance, from its\r\nlove of grain; and should, therefore, be kept in the yard until all\r\ncorn is too strong in the root to present any temptation.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the separation which, with the exception of certain\r\nseasons, subsists between the cock and hen turkey in a wild state, they\r\nhave been taught to feed and live amiably together in a state of\r\ndomesticity. The former, however, retains sufficient of his hereditary\r\npropensities to give an occasional sly blow to a froward chicken, but\r\nthat very seldom of a serious or malicious character.\r\n\r\nOne reason why the turkeys seen in poultry-yards do not vie in splendor\r\nof plumage with their untamed brethren is, that they are not allowed to\r\nlive long enough. For the same cause, the thorough development of their\r\ntemper and disposition is seldom witnessed. It does not attain its full\r\ngrowth till its fifth or sixth year, yet it is killed at latest in the\r\nsecond, to the evident deterioration of the stock. If some of the best\r\nbreeds were retained to their really adult state, and well fed\r\nmeanwhile, they would quite recompense their keeper by their beauty in\r\nfull plumage, their glancing hues of gilded green and purple, their\r\nlovely shades of bronze, brown, and black, and the pearly lustre that\r\nradiates from their polished feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DUCK.\r\n\r\nThis bird is of the order of _natatores_, or swimmers; family,\r\n_anatidae_, of the duck kind; genus, _anas_, or duck. The most striking\r\ncharacter of the swimming bird is derived from the structure of the\r\n_feet_, which are always palmate--that is, furnished with webs between\r\nthe toes. There are always three toes directed forward, and these are\r\nusually united by a membrane to their extremities; but, in some cases,\r\nthe membrane is deeply cleft, and the toes are occasionally quite free,\r\nand furnished with a distinct web on each side. The fourth toe is\r\ngenerally but little developed, and often entirely wanting; when\r\npresent, it is usually directed backward, and the membrane is sometimes\r\ncontinued to it along the side of the feet. These webbed feet are the\r\nprincipal agents by which the birds propel themselves through the water,\r\nupon the surface of which most of them pass a great portion of their\r\ntime. The feet are generally placed very far back, a position which is\r\nexceedingly favorable to their action in swimming, but which renders\r\ntheir progression on the land somewhat awkward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EIDER DUCK.]\r\n\r\nThe _body_ is generally stout and heavy, and covered with a very thick,\r\nclose, downy plumage, which the bird keeps constantly anointed with the\r\ngreasy secretions of the caudal gland, so that it is completely\r\nwater-proof. The _wings_ exhibit a great variety in their development;\r\nin some species being merely rudimentary, destitute of quills, and\r\ncovered with a scaly skin--in others, being of vast size and power, and\r\nthe birds passing a great part of their lives in the air. The form of\r\nthe _bill_ is also very remarkable; in some, broad and flat; in others,\r\ndeep and compressed; and in others, long and slender.\r\n\r\nMost of these birds live in societies, which are often exceedingly\r\nnumerous, inhabiting high northern and southern latitudes.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristic of the family of the _anatidae_ is the\r\n_bill_, which is usually of a flattened form, covered with a soft skin,\r\nand furnished at the edges with a series of _lamellae_, which serve to\r\nsift or strain the mud in which they generally seek their food. The feet\r\nare furnished with four toes, three of which are directed forward, and\r\nunited by a web; the fourth is directed backward, usually of small size,\r\nand quite free. They are admirable swimmers, and live and move on the\r\nwater with the utmost security, ease, and grace. Such is their\r\nadaptation to this element that the young, immediately after being\r\nhatched, will run to it, and fearlessly launch themselves upon its\r\nbosom, rowing themselves along with their webbed feet, without a single\r\nlesson, and yet as dexterously as the most experienced boatman. They are\r\ngenerally inhabitants of the fresh waters, and for the most part, prefer\r\nponds and shallow lakes, in which they can investigate the bottom with\r\ntheir peculiar bills, without actually diving beneath the surface; yet\r\nat some seasons they are found along the borders of the sea. Their food\r\ngenerally consists of worms, mollusca, and aquatic insects, which they\r\nseparate from the mud by the agency of the lamellae at the margin of the\r\nbill; but most of them also feed upon seeds, fruits, and other vegetable\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WILD DUCK.\r\n\r\nThis bird, known also by the name of _mallard_, is the original of all\r\nthe domestic varieties. It is twenty-four inches long, and marked with\r\ngreen, chestnut and white. Wild ducks are gregarious in their habits,\r\nand generally migrate in large flocks. The males are larger than the\r\nfemales, and the latter are also usually of a more uniform and sober\r\ntint.\r\n\r\nIt is an inhabitant of all the countries of Europe, especially toward\r\nthe north, and is also abundant in North America, where it is migratory,\r\npassing to the North in Spring, and returning to the South in autumn. It\r\nfrequents the lakes of the interior, as well as the sea-coasts. It is\r\nplentiful in Great Britain at all seasons, merely quitting the more\r\nexposed situations at the approach of winter, and taking shelter in the\r\nvalleys; or, in case of a severe winter, visiting the estuaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD DUCK.]\r\n\r\nThey moult twice in the year, in June and November; in June, the males\r\nacquire the female plumage to a certain extent, but regain their proper\r\ndress at the second moult, and retain it during the breeding season. In\r\na wild state, the mallard always pairs, and, during the period of\r\nincubation, the male, although taking no part in the process, always\r\nkeeps in the neighborhood of the female; and it is singular that\r\nhalf-bred birds between the wild and tame varieties always exhibit the\r\nsame habits, although the ordinary domestic drakes are polygamous,\r\nalways endeavoring to get as many wives as they can. The nest is usually\r\nplaced upon the ground among reeds and ledges near the water; sometimes\r\nin holes or hollow trees, but rarely among the branches. The eggs vary\r\nfrom about eight to fourteen in number, and the young are active from\r\nthe moment of their exclusion, and soon take to the water, where they\r\nare as much at home as the old birds.\r\n\r\nAs the flesh of wild ducks is greatly valued, immense numbers are shot,\r\nor taken in other ways. In England, large numbers are captured by\r\ndecoys, consisting of a piece of water situated in the midst of a quiet\r\nplantation, from which six semicircular canals are cut, which are roofed\r\nover with hoops, and covered in with netting. Into this vast trap the\r\nducks are enticed by young ducks trained for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMESTIC DUCK.\r\n\r\nThe duck should always find a place in the poultry-yard, provided that\r\nit can have access to water, even a small supply of which will suffice.\r\nThey have been kept with success, and the ordinary duck fattened to the\r\nweight of eight pounds, with no further supply of water than that\r\nafforded by a large pool sunk in the ground. In a garden, ducks will do\r\ngood service, voraciously consuming slops, frogs, and insects--nothing,\r\nindeed, coming amiss to them; not being scratchers, they do not, like\r\nother poultry, commit such a degree of mischief, in return, as to\r\npartially counterbalance their usefulness. A drake and two or three\r\nducks cost little to maintain; and the only trouble they will give is,\r\nthat if there is much extent of water or shrubbery about their home,\r\nthey will lay and sit abroad, unless they are brought up every night,\r\nwhich should be done. They will otherwise drop their eggs carelessly\r\nhere and there, or incubate in places where their eggs will be sucked by\r\ncrows, and half their progeny destroyed by rats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUEN DUCK.]\r\n\r\nThe duck is very prolific, and its egg is very much relished by some,\r\nhaving a rich piquancy of flavor, which gives it a decided superiority\r\nover the egg of the domestic fowl; and these qualities render it much in\r\nrequest with the pastry-cook and confectioner--three duck's eggs being\r\nequal in culinary value to six hen's eggs. The duck does not lay during\r\nthe day, but generally in the night; exceptions, regulated by\r\ncircumstances, will, of course, occasionally occur. While laying, it\r\nrequires, as has been intimated, more attention than does the hen, until\r\nit is accustomed to resort to a regular nest for depositing its eggs;\r\nwhen, however, this is once effected, little care is needed beyond what\r\nhas been indicated.\r\n\r\nThe duck is a bad hatcher, being too fond of the water, and,\r\nconsequently, too apt to allow her eggs to get cold; she will also, no\r\nmatter what kind of weather it may be, bring the ducklings to the water\r\nthe moment they break the shell--a practice always injurious, and\r\nfrequently fatal; hence the very common practice of setting duck's eggs\r\nunder hens.\r\n\r\nThere are several _varieties_ of tame ducks; but their merits are more\r\ndiverse in an ornamental than in a profitable point of view. Of _white_\r\nducks, the best is the _Aylesbury_, with its unspotted, snowy plumage,\r\nand yellow legs and feet. It is large and excellent for the table, but\r\nnot larger or better than several others. They are assiduous mothers and\r\nnurses, especially after the experience of two or three seasons. A much\r\nsmaller race of white ducks is imported from Holland, useful only to the\r\nproprietors of extensive or secluded waters, as enticers of passing wild\r\nbirds to alight and join their society. This variety has a yellow-orange\r\nbill; that of the Aylesbury should be flesh-colored. There is, also, the\r\n_white hook-billed_ duck, with a bill monstrously curved downward--a\r\nRoman-nosed duck, in fact--with Jewish features, of a most grotesque and\r\nludicrous appearance; the bill has some resemblance in its curvature to\r\nthat of the Flamingo. White ducks, of course, make but a sorry figure in\r\ntowns or dirty suburbs, or in any place where the means of washing\r\nthemselves are scanty.\r\n\r\nThere are one or two pretty varieties, not very common; one of a\r\n_slate-gray_, or bluish dun, another of a _sandy-yellow_; there are also\r\nsome with top-knots as compact and spherical as those of any Polish\r\nfowl, which rival the hook-billed in oddity. What are termed the _white_\r\nPoland and the _black_ Poland are crested; they breed early, and are\r\nexcellent layers; the former are deemed the most desirable though the\r\nblack are the larger.\r\n\r\nOf _mottled_ and _pied_ sorts, there exists a great variety; black and\r\nwhite, bronze and white, lightly speckled, and many other mixtures. To\r\nthis class belongs the _Rouen_--or Rhone, or Rohan, since each\r\ndesignation has been used--duck, which has been needlessly overpraised\r\nby interested dealers. This variety is highly esteemed by epicures; it\r\nis a prolific bird, and lays large eggs; its size is the criterion of\r\nits value. There is also a pied variety of the _Poland_ ducks, a hybrid\r\nbetween the white and the black, the Beaver.\r\n\r\nAnother variety, known as the _Labrador_, the Buenos Ayres, or the black\r\nEast Indian duck, is somewhat rare and highly esteemed by dealers. They\r\nare very beautiful birds. The feet, legs, and entire plumage should be\r\nblack; a few white feathers will occasionally appear. The bill also is\r\nblack, with a slight under-tinge of green. Not only the neck and back,\r\nbut the larger feathers of the tail and wings are gilt with metallic\r\ngreen; the female also exhibits slight traces of the same decoration. On\r\na sunshiny spring day, the effect of these glittering black ducks\r\nsporting in the blue water is very pleasing.\r\n\r\nA peculiarity of this variety is, that they occasionally--that is, at\r\nthe commencement of the season--lay black eggs; the color of those\r\nsubsequently laid gradually fades to that of the common kinds. This\r\nsingular appearance is not caused by any internal strain penetrating the\r\nwhole thickness of the shell, but by an oily pigment, which may be\r\nscraped off with the nail. They lay, perhaps, a little later than other\r\nducks, but are not more difficult to rear. Their voice, likewise, is\r\nsaid to differ slightly from that of other varieties; but they are far\r\nsuperior in having a high, wild-duck flavor and, if well kept, are in\r\ndeserved repute as being excellent food when killed immediately from the\r\npond, without any fattening.\r\n\r\nStill another breed, known as the _Muscovy_ duck, is a distinct species\r\nfrom the common duck; and the hybrid race will not, therefore, breed\r\nagain between themselves, although they are capable of doing so with\r\neither of the species from the commixture of which they spring. This\r\nduck does not derive its name from having been brought from the country\r\nindicated, but from the flavor of its flesh, and should more properly be\r\ntermed the _musk_ duck, of which this name is but a corruption. It is\r\neasily distinguished by a red membrane surrounding the eyes, and\r\ncovering the cheeks. Not being in esteem, on account of their peculiar\r\nodor, and the unpleasant flavor of their flesh, they are not worth\r\nbreeding, unless to cross with the common varieties; in which case, the\r\nmusk drake must be put to the common duck. This will produce a very\r\nlarge cross, while the opposite course will beget a very inferior one.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GOOSE.\r\n\r\nTHE WILD GOOSE. The goose belongs to the same family as the duck, but is\r\nclassed with the genus _anser_. The _gray-leg_ goose--a common wild\r\ngoose of England--is by some regarded as the original of the domestic\r\nbird. It is thirty-five inches long; upper parts ash-brown and ash-gray;\r\nunder parts white. This variety is migratory, proceeding to the Northern\r\nparts of Europe and Asia in summer, and to the South in winter.\r\n\r\nThe _Canada_, or Cravat goose, the wild goose of this country, is a fine\r\nspecies, forty inches long, often seen in spring and autumn in large,\r\ntriangular flocks, high in air, and led by an old, experienced gander,\r\nwho frequently utters a loud _honk_, equivalent, doubtless, to \"All's\r\nwell!\" This sound often comes upon the ear at night, when the flock are\r\ninvisible; and it is frequently heard even in the daytime, seeming to\r\ncome from the sky, the birds being beyond the reach of vision. Immense\r\nnumbers of these noble birds are killed in Canada, as well as along our\r\ncoasts, where they assemble in the autumn in large flocks, and remain\r\ntill driven to more Southern climates by the season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD OR CANADA GOOSE.]\r\n\r\nThe Canada goose is capable of domestication, and, in spite of its\r\noriginal migratory habits--which it appears, in almost every instance,\r\nto forget in England--shows much more disposition for a truly domestic\r\nlife than the swan; and it may be maintained in perfect health with very\r\nlimited opportunities for bathing. They eat worms and soft insects, as\r\nwell as grass and aquatic plants; with us, they do not breed until they\r\nare at least two years old, and so far approach the swan; like which\r\nbird, also, the male appears to be fit for reproduction at an earlier\r\nperiod than the female. Many writers speak highly of the half-bred\r\nCanada. They are, certainly, very large, and may merit approbation on\r\nthe table; but with whatever other species the cross is made, they are\r\nhideously disgusting.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DOMESTIC GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThe goose is not mentioned in the Bible, but it was known to the ancient\r\nEgyptians, and is represented in numerous instances on their monuments,\r\nshowing that it was anciently used for food, as in our own times. It was\r\nheld sacred by the Romans, because it was said to have alarmed, by its\r\ncackling at night, the sentinels of the capitol, at the invasion of the\r\nGauls, and thus to have saved the city. This was attributed by one of\r\nthe Roman writers to its fine sense of smell, which enables them to\r\nperceive at a great distance the odor of the human race. The liver of\r\nthis bird seems to have been a favorite morsel with epicures in all\r\nages; and invention appears to have been active in exercising the means\r\nof increasing the volume of that organ. It is generally esteemed a\r\nfoolish bird; yet it displays courage in defending its young, and\r\ninstances of attachment and gratitude have shown that it is not\r\ndeficient in sentiment. The value and usefulness of geese are scarcely\r\ncalculable. The only damage which they do lies in the quantity of food\r\nwhich they consume; the only care they require is to be saved from\r\nstarvation. All the fears and anxieties requisite to educate the turkey\r\nand prepare it for making a proper appearance at the table are with them\r\nunnecessary; grass by day, a dry bed at night, and a tolerably attentive\r\nmother, are all that is required. Roast goose, fatted to the point of\r\nrepletion, is almost the only luxury that is not deemed an extravagance\r\nin an economical farm-house; for there are the feathers, to swell the\r\nstock of beds; there is the dripping, to enrich the dumpling or pudding;\r\nthere are the giblets, for market or a pie; and there is the wholesome,\r\nsolid, savory flesh for all parties interested.\r\n\r\nThey are accused by some of rendering the spots where they feed\r\noffensive to other stock; but the explanation is simple. A horse bites\r\ncloser than an ox; a sheep goes nearer to the ground than a horse; but,\r\nafter the sharpest shearing by sheep, the goose will polish up the tuft,\r\nand grow fat upon the remnants of others. Consequently, where geese are\r\nkept in great numbers on a small area, little will be left to maintain\r\nany other grass-eating creature. If, however, the pastures are not\r\nshort, it will not be found that other grazing animals object to feeding\r\neither together with, or immediately after, a flock of geese.\r\n\r\nThe goose has the merit of being the earliest of poultry. In three\r\nmonths, or, about four, from leaving the egg, the birds ought to be fit\r\nfor the feather-bed, the spit, and the fire. It is not only very early\r\nin its laying, but also very late. It often anticipates the spring in\r\nNovember, and, afterward, when spring really comes in March, it cannot\r\nresist its general influence. The autumnal eggs afford useful employment\r\nto turkeys and hens that choose to sit at unseasonable times; and the\r\nperiod of incubation is less tedious than that required for the eggs of\r\nsome other birds.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the domestic goose is quite powerful enough, especially in\r\nyoung birds, to allow them to escape in that way, where they are so\r\ninclined. In the autumn, whole broods may be seen by early risers taking\r\ntheir morning flight, and circling in the air for matutinal exercise,\r\njust like pigeons, when first let out of their locker. The bird lives to\r\na very great age, sometimes seventy years or more.\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of our domestic species, opinions differ. By some, as\r\nalready remarked, the gray-leg is regarded as the parent stock; others\r\nconsider it a mongrel, like the dunghill fowl, made up of several\r\nvarieties, to each of which it occasionally shows more or less affinity;\r\nand yet others contend that it is not to be referred to any existing\r\nspecies. The latter assert that there is really but one variety of the\r\ndomestic goose, individuals of which are found from entirely white\r\nplumage, through different degrees of patchedness with gray, to entirely\r\ngray coloring, except on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe domestic gander is polygamous, but he is not an indiscriminate\r\nlibertine; he will rarely couple with females of any other species.\r\nHybrid common geese are almost always produced by the union of a wild\r\ngander with a domestic goose, and not by the opposite. The ganders are\r\ngenerally, though not invariably, white, and are sometimes called Embden\r\ngeese, from a town of Hanover. High feeding, care, and moderate warmth\r\nwill induce a prolific habit, which becomes, in some measure,\r\nhereditary. The season of the year at which the young are hatched--and\r\nthey may be reared at any season--influences their future size and\r\ndevelopment. After allowing for these causes of diversity, it is claimed\r\nthat the domestic goose constitutes only one species or permanent\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BERNACLE GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis bird is sometimes called the Barnacle goose; its name originates\r\nfrom the fact that it was formerly supposed to be bred from the shells\r\nso termed, which cling to wood in the sea. It is about twenty-five\r\ninches long, and is found wild in Europe, abundantly in the Baltic; and,\r\noccasionally, as it is said, in Hudson's Bay, on this continent.\r\n\r\nThis bird is one of those species in which the impulse of reproduction\r\nhas at length overcome the sullenness of captivity, and instances of\r\ntheir breeding when in confinement have increased in frequency to such\r\nan extent that hopes are entertained of the continuance of that\r\nincrease. The young so reared should be pinioned at the wrist as a\r\nprecaution. They would probably stay at home contentedly, if unpinioned,\r\nuntil the approach of inclement weather, when they would be tempted to\r\nleave their usual haunts in search of marshes, unfrozen springs,\r\nmud-banks left by the tide, and the open sea; or they might be induced\r\nto join a flock of wild birds, instead of returning to their former\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nBroods of five, six, and seven have been reared; but they are generally\r\nvalued as embellishments to ponds merely, their small size rendering\r\nthem suitable even for a very limited pleasure-ground, and the variety\r\nbeing perhaps the prettiest geese that are thus employed. The lively\r\ncombination of black, white, gray, and lavender, gives them the\r\nappearance of being in agreeable half-mourning. The female differs\r\nlittle from the male, being distinguished by voice and deportment more\r\nthan by plumage. Their short bill, the moderate-sized webs of their\r\nfeet, and their rounded proportions, indicate an affinity with the\r\ncurious Cereopsis goose, which is found in considerable numbers on the\r\nseashore of Sucky Bay and Goose Island, at the south-eastern point of\r\nAustralia.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs laid is six or seven, and the time of incubation is\r\nabout a month; it being difficult to name the exact period, from the\r\nuncertainty respecting the precise hour when the process commences. They\r\nare steady sitters. The young are lively and active little creatures,\r\nrunning hither and thither, and tugging at the blades of grass. Their\r\nground color is of a dirty white; their legs, feet, eyes, and short\r\nstump of a bill, are black; they have a gray spot on the crown of the\r\nhead, gray patches on the back and wings, and a yellowish tinge about\r\nthe forepart of the head. The old birds are very gentle in their\r\ndisposition and habits, and are less noisy than most geese.\r\n\r\nThe service they may render as weed-eaters is important, though their\r\nsize alone precludes any comparison of them, in this respect, with the\r\nswan. Their favorite feeding-grounds are extensive flats, partially\r\ninundated by the higher tides; and their breeding may perhaps best be\r\npromoted by their being furnished with a little sea-weed during winter\r\nand early spring; a few shrimps, or small mussels, would probably not be\r\nunacceptable. A single pair is more likely to breed than if they are\r\ncongregated in larger numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BREMEN GOOSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BREMEN GOOSE.]\r\n\r\nThe Bremen geese--so called from the place whence they were originally\r\nimported, though some term them Embden geese--have been bred in this\r\ncountry, pure, and to a feather, since 1821; no single instance having\r\noccurred in which the slightest deterioration of character could be\r\nobserved. The produce has invariably been of the purest white; the bill,\r\nlegs, and feet being of a beautiful yellow.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of this goose does not partake of that dry character which\r\nbelongs to other and more common kinds, but is as tender and juicy as\r\nthe flesh of a wild fowl; it shrinks less in cooking than that of any\r\nother fowl. Some pronounce its flesh equal if not superior to that of\r\nthe canvas-back duck.\r\n\r\nThey likewise sit and hatch with more certainty than common barn-yard\r\ngeese; will weigh nearly, and in some instances quite, twice the\r\nweight--the full-blood weighing twenty pounds and upward; they have\r\ndouble the quantity of feathers; and never fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BRENT GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis is a small species, twenty-one inches long, common in a wild state,\r\nin both Europe and America. On our coast, it is a favorite game-bird,\r\nand known by the name of _Brant_. It is easily tamed, and is said to\r\nhave produced young in captivity, though no details have been furnished.\r\n\r\nThis and the Sandwich Island goose are the smallest of their tribe yet\r\nintroduced to our aquatic aviaries. Their almost uniform color of leaden\r\nblack, and their compactness of form, make them a striking feature in\r\nthe scene, though they cannot be compared in beauty with many other\r\nwaterfowl. There is so little difference in the sexes that it is not\r\neasy to distinguish them. Their chief merit rests in their fondness for\r\nwater-weeds, in which respect they appear to be second only to the swan.\r\nThey are quiet, gentle and harmless in captivity. Some praise their\r\nflesh, while others pronounce it fishy, strong, and oily; they may,\r\nhowever, be converted into tolerable meat by being skinned and baked in\r\na pie.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHINA GOOSE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHINA OR HONG KONG GOOSE.]\r\n\r\nThis bird figures under a variety of _aliases_: Knob goose, Hong Kong\r\ngoose, Asiatic goose, Swan goose, Chinese Swan Guinea goose, Polish\r\ngoose, Muscovy goose, and, probably, others.\r\n\r\nThere is something in the aspect of this creature--in the dark-brown\r\nstripe down its neck, its small, bright eye, its harsh voice, its\r\nceremonious strut, and its affectation of seldom being in a hurry--which\r\nseems to say that it came from China. If so, it has no doubt been\r\ndomesticated for many hundred years, perhaps as long as the pea fowl or\r\nthe common fowl. They may be made to lay a large number of eggs by an\r\nincreased supply of nourishing food. If liberally furnished with oats,\r\nboiled rice, etc., the China goose will, in the spring, lay from twenty\r\nto thirty eggs before she begins to sit, and again in the autumn, after\r\nher moult, from ten to fifteen more. Another peculiarity is their\r\ndeficient power of flight, compared with other geese, owing to the\r\nlarger proportionate size of their bodies. Indeed, of all geese, this is\r\nthe worst flyer; there is no occasion to pinion them; the common\r\ndomestic goose flies much more strongly.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing color of their plumage is brown, comparable to the color\r\nof wheat. The different shades are very harmoniously blended, and are\r\nwell relieved by the black tuberculated bill, and the pure white of the\r\nabdomen. Their movements on the water are graceful and swan-like. Slight\r\nvariations occur in the color of the feet and legs, some having them of\r\na dull orange, others black; a delicate fringe of minute white feathers\r\nis occasionally seen at the base of the bill. These peculiarities are\r\nhereditarily transmitted.\r\n\r\nThe male is almost as much disproportionately larger than the female as\r\nthe Musk drake is in comparison with his mate. He is much inclined to\r\nlibertine wanderings, without, however, neglecting proper attention at\r\nhome. If there is any other gander on the premises, a disagreement is\r\nsure to result. Both male and female are, perhaps, the noisiest of all\r\ngeese; at night, the least footfall or motion in their neighborhood is\r\nsufficient to call forth their clangor and resonant trumpetings.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are somewhat less than those of the domestic kind, of a short\r\noval, with a smooth, thick shell, white, but slightly tinged with yellow\r\nat the smaller end. The goslings, when first hatched, are usually very\r\nstrong. They are of a dirty green, like the color produced by mixing\r\nIndia-ink and yellow ochre, with darker patches here and there. The legs\r\nand feet are lead-color, but afterward change to a dull red. With good\r\npasturage, they require no farther attention than that bestowed by their\r\nparents. After a time, a little grain will strengthen and forward them.\r\nIf well fed, they come to maturity very rapidly; in between three and\r\nfour months from the time of leaving the shell, they will be full-grown\r\nand ready for food. They do not bear being shut up to fatten so well as\r\ncommon geese, and, therefore, those destined for the table are the\r\nbetter for profuse hand-feeding. Their flesh is well-flavored, short,\r\nand tender; their eggs, excellent for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\nThey are said to be a short-lived species; the ganders, at least, not\r\nlasting more than ten or a dozen years. Hybrids between them and the\r\ncommon goose are prolific with the latter; the second and third cross is\r\nmuch prized by some farmers, particularly for their ganders; and in many\r\nflocks the blood of the China goose may be traced oftentimes by the more\r\nerect gait of the birds, accompanied by a faint stripe down the back of\r\nthe neck. With the White-grented goose they also breed freely.\r\n\r\n_The White-China._ These are larger than the preceding, and apparently\r\nmore terrestrial in their habits; the knob on the head is not only of\r\ngreater proportion, but of a different shape. It is of a spotless, pure\r\nwhite--though a very few gray feathers occasionally appear--more\r\nswan-like than the brown, with a bright orange-colored bill, and a large\r\nknot of the same color at its base. It is particularly beautiful,\r\neither in or out of the water, its neck being long, slender, and\r\ngracefully arched when swimming. It breeds three or four times in the\r\nseason; the egg is quite small for the size of the bird, being not more\r\nthan half the size of that of the common goose.\r\n\r\nIn many instances, efforts to obtain young from their eggs have been\r\nunsuccessful; but if the female is supplied with the eggs of the common\r\ngoose, she invariably hatches and rears the goslings. They sit\r\nremarkably well, never showing themselves out of the nest by day; but,\r\npossibly, they may leave the nest too long in the cold of the night.\r\nSome think that a quiet lake is more to their taste than a rapid running\r\nstream, and more conducive to the fecundity of their eggs. It is also\r\nbelieved by many that, under favorable circumstances, they would be very\r\nprolific.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EGYPTIAN GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis species is bred to a certain extent in this country. It is a most\r\nstately and rich bird, reminding one of the solemn antiquity of the\r\nNile, with its gorgeous mantle of golden hues and its long history.\r\n\r\nIt is dark red round the eyes; red ring round the neck; white bill; neck\r\nand breast light fawn-gray; a maroon star on the breast; belly red and\r\ngray; half of the wing-feathers rich black, the other part of them pure\r\nwhite; black bar running across the centre, back light-red, growing\r\ndark-red toward the tail; the tail a deep black.\r\n\r\nThey are very prolific, bringing off three broods a year, from eight to\r\ntwelve each time; their weight is about eight pounds each.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JAVA GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThe gander of this species is white, with head and half the neck\r\nlight-fawn; red tubercle at the root of the bill; larger than the common\r\ngoose, and longer in the body; walks erect, standing as high as the\r\nChina goose, the female appearing to carry two pouches, or egg-bags,\r\nunder the belly.\r\n\r\nIt is very prolific; and the meat is of fine flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOULOUSE GOOSE.\r\n\r\nThis bird is said to have been originally imported from the\r\nMediterranean; and is known also by the names Mediterranean goose, and\r\nPyrenean goose. It is chiefly remarkable for its vast size, in which\r\nrespect it surpasses all others.\r\n\r\nIts prevailing color is a slaty blue, marked with brown bars, and\r\noccasionally relieved with black; the head, neck, as far as the\r\nbeginning of the breast, and the back of the neck, as far as the\r\nshoulders, of a dark-brown; the breast slaty-blue; the belly is white,\r\nin common with the under surface of the tail; the bill is orange-red,\r\nand the feet flesh-color.\r\n\r\nIn habit, the Toulouse goose resembles his congeners, but seems to\r\npossess a milder and more tractable disposition, which greatly conduces\r\nto the chance of his early fattening, and that, too, at a little cost.\r\nThe curl of the plumage on the neck comes closer to the head than that\r\non common geese, and the abdominal pouch, which, in other varieties, is\r\nan accompaniment of age, exists from the shell. The flesh is said to be\r\ntender and well-flavored.\r\n\r\nSome pronounce this bird the unmixed and immediate descendant of the\r\nGray-leg; while others assert that it is only the common domestic,\r\nenlarged by early hatching, very liberal feeding during youth, fine\r\nclimate, and, perhaps, by age, and style them grenadier individuals of\r\nthe domestic goose--nothing more.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE.\r\n\r\nIn its wild state, the White-fronted or Laughing goose is twenty-seven\r\ninches long, and found in great numbers in Europe and in the North\r\nAmerican Fur countries, but rare along our coasts.\r\n\r\nWhen domesticated, it belongs to the class of birds which are restrained\r\nfrom resuming their original wild habits more by the influence of local\r\nand personal attachment than from any love which they seem to have for\r\nthe comforts of domestication; which may be trusted with their entire\r\nliberty, or nearly so, but require an eye to be kept on them from time\r\nto time, lest they stray away and assume an independent condition. The\r\nwhite-fronted goose well deserves the patronage of those who have even a\r\nsmall piece of grass.\r\n\r\nThe first impression of every one, upon seeing this species in\r\nconfinement, would be that it could not be trusted with liberty; and the\r\nsight of it exercising its wings at its first escape would make its\r\nowner despair of recovering it. This is not, however, the case. By no\r\ngreat amount of care and attention, they will manifest such a degree of\r\nconfidence and attachment as to remove all hesitation as to the future;\r\nand they may be regarded as patterns of all that is valuable in anserine\r\nnature--gentle, affectionate, cheerful, hardy, useful, and\r\nself-dependent. The gander is an attentive parent, but not a faithful\r\nspouse.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are smaller than those of the common goose, pure white, and of\r\na very long oval; the shell is also thinner than in, most others; the\r\nflesh is excellent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving completed the enumeration and description of the varieties of\r\npoultry, it will, perhaps, be appropriate to give some account, before\r\nproceeding to the next general division of the subject, of the\r\nstructure, or anatomy, so to speak, of\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EGG.\r\n\r\nIn a laying hen may be found, upon opening the body, what is called the\r\n_ovarium_--a cluster of rudimental eggs, of different sizes, from very\r\nminute points up to shapes of easily-distinguished forms. These\r\nrudimental eggs have as yet no shell or white, these being exhibited in\r\na different stage of development; but consist wholly of _yolk_, on the\r\nsurface of which the germ of the future chicken lies. The yolk and the\r\ngerm are enveloped by a very thin membrane.\r\n\r\nWhen the rudimental egg, still attached to the ovarium, becomes longer\r\nand larger, and arrives at a certain size, either its own weight, or\r\nsome other efficient cause, detaches it from the cluster, and makes it\r\nfall into a sort of funnel, leading to a pipe, which is termed the\r\n_oviduct_.\r\n\r\nHere the yolk of the rudimental egg, hitherto imperfectly formed, puts\r\non its mature appearance of a thick yellow fluid; while the rudimental\r\nchick or embryo, lying on the surface opposite to that by which it had\r\nbeen attached to the ovarium, is white, and somewhat like paste.\r\n\r\nThe white, or _albumen_, of the egg now becomes diffused around the\r\nyolk, being secreted from the blood vessels of the egg-pipe, or oviduct,\r\nin the form of a thin, glassy fluid; and it is prevented from mixing\r\nwith the yolk and the embryo chicken by the thin membrane which\r\nsurrounded them before they were detached from the egg-cluster, while\r\nit is strengthened by a second and stronger membrane, formed around the\r\nfirst, immediately after falling into the oviduct. This second membrane,\r\nenveloping the yolk of the germ of the chicken, is thickest at the two\r\nends, having what may be termed bulgings, termed _chalazes_ by\r\nanatomists; these bulgings of the second membrane pass quite through the\r\nwhite at the ends, and being thus, as it were, embedded in the white,\r\nthey keep the inclosed yolk and germ somewhat in a fixed position,\r\npreventing them from rolling about within the egg when it is moved.\r\n\r\nThe white of the egg being thus formed, a third membrane, or, rather, a\r\ndouble membrane, much stronger than either of the first two, is formed\r\naround it, becoming attached to the chalazes of the second membrane, and\r\ntending still more to keep all the parts in their relative positions.\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of these several formations, the egg gradually\r\nadvances about half way along the oviduct. It is still, however,\r\ndestitute of the shell, which begins to be formed by a process similar\r\nto the formation of the shell of a snail, as soon as the outer layer of\r\nthe third membrane has been completed. When the shell is fully formed,\r\nthe egg continues to advance along the oviduct, till the hen goes to her\r\nnest and lays it.\r\n\r\nFrom ill health, or accidents, eggs are sometimes excluded from the\r\noviducts before the shell has begun to be formed, and in this state they\r\nare popularly called _wind-eggs_.\r\n\r\nReckoning, then, from the shell inward, there are _six_ different\r\nenvelopes, of which one only could be detected before the descent of the\r\negg into the oviduct: the shell; the external layer of the membrane\r\nlining the shell; the internal layer of same lining; the white, composed\r\nof a thinner liquid on the outside, and a thicker and more yellowish\r\nliquid on the inside; the bulgings, or chalaziferous membrane; and the\r\nproper membrane.\r\n\r\nOne important part of the egg is the _air-bag_, placed at the larger\r\nend, between the shell and its lining membrane. This is about the size\r\nof the eye of a small bird in new-laid eggs, but is increased as much as\r\nten times in the process of hatching. The air bag is of such great\r\nimportance to the development of the chicken--probably by supplying it\r\nwith a limited atmosphere of oxygen--that, if the blunt end of an egg be\r\npierced with the point of the smallest needle, the egg cannot be\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\nInstead of one rudimental egg falling from the ovarium, two may be\r\ndetected, and will, of course, be inclosed in the same shell, when the\r\negg will be double-yolked. The eggs of a goose have, in some instances,\r\ncontained even three yolks. If the double-yolked eggs be hatched, they\r\nwill rarely produce two separate chickens, but, more commonly,\r\nmonstrosities--chickens with two heads, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe _shell_ of an egg, chemically speaking, consists chiefly of\r\ncarbonate of lime, similar to chalk, with a small quantity of phosphate\r\nof lime, and animal mucus. When burnt, the animal matter and the\r\ncarbonic acid gas of the carbonate of lime are separated; the first\r\nbeing reduced to ashes, or animal charcoal, while the second is\r\ndissipated, leaving the decarbonized lime mixed with a little phosphate\r\nof lime.\r\n\r\nThe _white_ of the egg is without taste or smell, of a viscid, glairy\r\nconsistence, readily dissolving in water, coagulable by acids, by\r\nspirits of wine, and by a temperature of one hundred and sixty-five\r\ndegrees, Fahrenheit. If it has once been coagulated, it is no longer\r\nsoluble in either cold or hot water, and acquires a slight insipid\r\ntaste. It is composed of eighty parts of water, fifteen and a half parts\r\nof albumen, and four and a half parts of mucus; besides giving traces of\r\nsoda, benzoic acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen gas. The latter, on an egg\r\nbeing eaten on a silver spoon, stains the spoon of a blackish purple, by\r\ncombining with the silver, and forming sulphuret of silver.\r\n\r\nThe white of the egg is a very feeble conductor of heat, retarding its\r\nescape; and preventing its entrance to the yolk; a providential\r\ncontrivance, not merely to prevent speedy fermentation and corruption,\r\nbut to arrest the fatal chills, which might occur in hatching, when the\r\nmother hen leaves her eggs, from time to time, in search of food. Eels\r\nand other fish which can live long out of water, secrete a similar\r\nviscid substance on the surface of their bodies, furnished to them,\r\ndoubtless, for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nThe _yolk_ has an insipid, bland, oily taste; and, when agitated with\r\nwater, forms a milky emulsion. If it is long boiled it becomes a\r\ngranular, friable solid, yielding upon expression, a yellow, insipid,\r\nfixed oil. It consists, chemically, of water, oil, albumen, and\r\ngelatine. In proportion to the quantity of albumen, the egg boils hard.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the eggs of the domestic fowl varies materially; in some\r\nbreeds, averaging thirty-three ounces per dozen, in others, but fourteen\r\nand a half ounces. A fair average weight for a dozen is twenty-two and a\r\nhalf ounces. Yellow, mahogany, and salmon-colored eggs are generally\r\nricher than white ones, containing, as they do, a larger quantity of\r\nyolk. These are generally preferred for culinary purposes; while the\r\nlatter, containing an excess of albumen, are preferred for boiling,\r\netc., for the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBREEDING AND MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING. Good fowls are very profitable in the keeping of intelligent\r\nbreeders. It is stated, by those most competent to express the opinion,\r\nthat four acres of land, devoted to the rearing of the best varieties of\r\npoultry, will, at ordinary prices, be quite as productive as a farm of\r\none hundred and fifty acres cultivated in the usual way. The eggs of the\r\ncommon and cheaper kinds which might be used for incubators and nurses,\r\nwould pay--or could be made to pay, if properly preserved, and sold at\r\nthe right time--all expenses of feed, etc.; while good capons of the\r\nlarger breeds will bring, in any of our larger markets, from three to\r\nfive dollars per pair, and early spring chickens from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five cents per pound.\r\n\r\nTo make poultry profitable, then, it is only necessary that the better\r\nkinds be bred from, that suitable places be provided for them, that they\r\nbe properly fed, and carefully and intelligently managed. These\r\nrequirements are too rarely complied with, in every respect, to enable a\r\ncorrect opinion to be formed as to what may be made out of poultry under\r\nthe most favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nA few general principles, well-understood and faithfully applied, will\r\nprove of great value. By \"in-and-in breeding\" is meant commerce between\r\nindividuals of the same brood, or brother and sister, so to speak; by\r\n\"close breeding,\" commerce between the parent and his offspring, in\r\nwhatever degree.\r\n\r\n_Crossing the breed._ To insure successful and beneficial crossing of\r\ndistinct breeds, in order to produce a new and valuable variety, the\r\nbreeder must have an accurate knowledge of the laws of procreation, and\r\nthe varied influences of parents upon their offspring. All the breeds in\r\nthis country are crosses, produced either by accident or design.\r\nCrossing does not necessarily produce a breed; but it always produces a\r\nvariety, and that variety becomes a breed only where there is a\r\nsufficiency of stamina to make a distinctive race, and continue a\r\nprogeny with the uniform or leading characteristics of its progenitors.\r\n\r\n_High breeding._ When uniformity of plumage can be effected in mixed\r\nbreeds or varieties without a resort to in-and-in, or close breeding,\r\nand without sacrificing the health and vigor of the race, it is\r\ndesirable; and, in many instances, it can be accomplished in a\r\nsatisfactory manner. What are called highly-bred fowls are, however,\r\ntoo often the deteriorated offspring of progenitors far below\r\nthe original stock. Genuine high breeding consists in the selection\r\nof parent stock of the same race, perfect in all the general\r\ncharacteristics, and _of remote consanguinity_. This should be resorted\r\nto periodically, in order to secure the best results.\r\n\r\nIf a race is _pure_--that is, if the species or variety is absolutely\r\ndistinct and unsophisticated--the progeny resembles the progenitors in\r\nalmost every respect. The mixture of races, where the consanguinity is\r\nremote, is productive of decided benefits.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, in the case of fowls: when the blood is _unmixed_--as\r\nwith the Guelderlands, and some others--the offspring, _in all\r\nrespects_, resemble their parents; in plumage, general habits, form,\r\noutline, etc. In this case, they look almost identically the same. But\r\nwhen the blood is _mixed_--as with the Cochin Chinas, and many\r\nothers--the plumage will vary widely, or slightly, according to\r\ncircumstances, though many or most of the general characteristics may\r\nremain the same. The close breeding, to which many resort for the\r\npurpose of procuring uniformity, generally results in an absolute\r\ndeterioration of the race in important respects.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, close breeding--and, occasionally, in-and-in--seems to be\r\nin accordance with the laws of Nature; as with the wild turkey, which,\r\nin its natural state, resorts to these modes of breeding; and yet the\r\nrace does not change in appearance or degenerate. The reason is that the\r\nbreed is pure. In comparing any number of these birds, not the least\r\ndissimilarity is discoverable; they all look alike, as they always\r\nhave, and always will. They are changed, or deteriorated, only by\r\ncrossing or confinement.\r\n\r\nMost breeds of the hen kind degenerate rapidly from close, or in-and-in\r\nbreeding, because they are not perfect of their kind; that is, the breed\r\nis not pure, but of mixed blood; and in such objectionable breeding, the\r\nrace degenerates just in proportion as the breed is imperfect, or\r\nimpure. The perfect Guelderland will admit of these modes of breeding,\r\nfor a great length of time, without deterioration; but the impure or\r\nmixed will rapidly degenerate. This is also true of all breeds, wherein\r\nthe characteristic marks are uniform and confirmed, showing perfection\r\nin the race.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, however, close and in-and-in breeding should be\r\ncarefully avoided where the race is not absolutely perfect, if it is\r\ndesired to improve the breed; and as all the breeds of this kind of\r\nfowls are of mixed blood, the danger of such breeding is greater or\r\nless, in exact proportion as the distinctive characteristics are variant\r\nor fixed; and the danger still increases if the breed is composed of\r\nstrains of blood greatly dissimilar, or of races widely differing in the\r\nconformation or general habits.\r\n\r\n_Preserving the distinctive breeds._ As to the time when the different\r\nbreeds of hens should be separated in the spring, in order to preserve\r\nthe breed pure, the most ample experience indicates that if the eggs be\r\npreserved and set after a separation of _two days_, the breed will be\r\nperfect, the offspring having all the characteristics or distinctive\r\nmarks.\r\n\r\nWhen a valuable breed is produced, either by accident or design, it\r\nshould be preserved, and the subsequent breeding should continue from\r\nthat stock; otherwise, there is no certainty of the purity of the blood\r\nof the new breed, for it does not follow that a different parentage,\r\nthough of the same name or original breed precisely, will produce the\r\nsame new breed, or any thing resembling it. The Dorking fowl, for\r\ninstance, was originally produced by crossing the Great Malay with the\r\nEnglish Game, as an accident; but it by no means follows that Dorkings\r\nare the uniform, or even the common result of such a cross, for hundreds\r\nof similar experiments have proved unsuccessful. The breeding,\r\ntherefore, to be pure-blooded, must continue from the stock originally\r\nproduced by accident; and as such breeding produces the leading\r\ncharacteristics of the race with great uniformity, the genuineness of\r\nthe breed cannot be doubted.\r\n\r\nIn order to produce a good cross, the parentage should be healthy, and\r\nfrom healthy races, not materially dissimilar in their general habits.\r\nThe _size of the leg_ should always be looked to, in order to judge\r\naccurately as to purity of blood. If the leg is large for the\r\nbreed--that is, if larger than the generality of the same breed--the\r\npurity of the blood, the fineness of the flesh, and most of the other\r\nvaluable qualities, can be relied on; but, if the legs are smaller than\r\nmost others of the same breed, the fowl is spurious, and of deteriorated\r\nblood. The fifth toe and feathered legs of some breeds were originally\r\nthe result of accident; but by long and careful breeding, they have\r\nbecome incorporated into the nature of certain races of general, though\r\nnot universal or essential, requisites. When a fowl exhibits any special\r\nmarks indicative of all the races or breeds from which the cross\r\noriginated, it is a sure evidence of extraordinary purity of blood, and\r\nof the superior excellence of the race. The best fowls of the race\r\nshould always be selected for crossing or general breeding; otherwise\r\nthe breeds will degenerate.\r\n\r\nThe _quality_--that is, the fineness, juiciness, and richness of\r\nflavor--of the flesh of domestic fowls is of much more importance than\r\ntheir size. All coarse-meated fowls should, therefore, be rejected, no\r\nmatter how large they may be. There is no difficulty in discriminating\r\nbetween coarse and fine fowls at any time. In the case of chickens, if\r\nthe down is straight and stands out, and the body and limbs are loosely\r\njoined, the meat is coarse; but if the down is glossy, and lies close to\r\nthe body, and the body and limbs are compactly formed, the meat is fine;\r\nand when grown, if the fowl is light in weight, in proportion to its\r\nsize, the flesh is coarse; but if heavy, the flesh is fine.\r\n\r\nThere is also a _fitness_ in the quality of the flesh; for, if the meat\r\nis fine, the bones are fine, and the feathers are fine; and the converse\r\nholds true. If the flesh is fine, it is juicy and richly flavored; if\r\ncoarse, it is dry, fibrous, and insipid.\r\n\r\nThe _color of the legs_, too, is quite material in judging of the\r\nquality of fowls. All other things being equal, dark-legged fowls have\r\nthe finest flesh, and are most hardy. Turkeys, which have the finest\r\nflesh of any fowl of their size, have black legs; the game-cock,\r\nlikewise, which is universally acknowledged to be the finest-fleshed of\r\nany of the domestic fowls, except the Wild Indian fowl of Calcutta, has\r\ndark legs. It does not, however, of necessity follow that all\r\ndark-legged fowls are fine, or that all yellow or white-legged ones are\r\ncoarse, since much depends upon the breed; but it is true that the\r\ndarkest leg which pertains to the breed indicates the finest fowl.\r\n\r\nThe _color of the feathers_, also, has more or less to do with the\r\nquality of the fowl. Some breeds have a much more brilliant plumage than\r\nothers; but when brilliancy of plumage is here spoken of, it is to be\r\nunderstood in comparison with others of the same breed. If, therefore, a\r\nfowl is selected of rich and glossy plumage, when compared with others\r\nof the same breed, the legs will be dark of the kind, and the quality of\r\nthe bird will excel.\r\n\r\nThe _best_ breeding is to cross or mix the races; this process improves\r\nthe breeds, in all respects. When the object in view is to perpetuate\r\ndistinct varieties of uncontaminated blood, the first requisite is to\r\nprocure fowls known to be of pure blood, and possessing all the\r\nnecessary characteristics of their kind. Labor is lost, unless the fowl\r\nselected is a perfect specimen of the variety; for whatever imperfection\r\nexists is likely to be perpetuated in the progeny. Regard should be had\r\nto plumage, size, and form, in making a selection either of a cock or a\r\npullet; and those are preferable which are hatched earliest in the year.\r\nThe _age_ of the fowls is a matter of considerable importance; and,\r\nthough it is true that a pullet will lay the greatest number of eggs in\r\nher first year, yet it is believed that the chickens which are hatched\r\nfrom the second year's eggs are more vigorous and hardy. Old hens are\r\ngenerally preferred to pullets as sitters, on account of their more\r\nsedate and matronly character. A young cock, though more active in his\r\nearliest days, and likely to bestow his attention on the hens with less\r\nreserve, is not, however, best for use in keeping up a breed. The eggs\r\nimpregnated by him after his first season are likely to produce the\r\nstrongest chickens. It is an error to suppose--as is often\r\nrepresented--that his procreative power is decayed or vitiated after\r\nthree or four years. On the contrary, a healthy, vigorous cock, if not\r\nallowed to walk with too many hens, may be valuable and useful in the\r\npoultry-yard for a longer time.\r\n\r\nAn error is often committed by assigning too many hens to one cock; and\r\nthe result is a weakly and otherwise deteriorated progeny. Not more than\r\n_five_ hens should be allowed to associate with a single cock, when the\r\nquality of the breed is a matter of interest. _Three_, indeed, would be\r\nthe better number for restriction; but five is the farthest limit which\r\ncan be safely assigned.\r\n\r\nMost persons, in obtaining a single vigorous cock and hen of a desirable\r\nvariety, find their anticipations more than realized in the production\r\nof a fine progeny. The plumage is brilliant, and the chickens are of\r\nincreased size, and remarkably strong and healthy. This desirable state\r\nof things continues so long as the cock is restricted to a small number\r\nof hens; but as soon as his harem is enlarged, different effects\r\nare manifested, and a deterioration in the stock is clearly\r\nobservable--attributable, not to close-breeding, but to the increased\r\ndisproportion of the females to the male, and the consequent overtasking\r\nof his powers.\r\n\r\nIn breeding-time, great cleanliness should be preserved in the lodgings\r\nof the fowls, and the quantity and quality of food should be attended\r\nto. They should not be suffered to feed to repletion, and such kinds of\r\nfood as are most nutritious should be carefully provided. Variety of\r\nfood is essential; and a proper proportion of animal and green food\r\nshould be given with their usual fare. Suitable arrangements should, of\r\ncourse, be made to prevent any intermixture of breeds. A constant\r\nvigilance in this respect is the price of success; and when all proper\r\nprecautions are taken, the breeder may be perfectly secure that his\r\nanticipations will be realized.\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF STOCK.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the domestic fowl, in a wild state, are too little known\r\nto ascertain whether the cocks always associate with the hens, or only\r\noccasionally. Though hens will lay some eggs without pairing, as this is\r\nnot natural, the number will, for the most part, be less, and the laying\r\nuncertain; it is, therefore, indispensable to attend to the laws of\r\nNature in this respect.\r\n\r\nThe number of hens to be allowed to one cock should vary with the object\r\nin view. The limit for valuable breeding purposes has already been\r\nindicated. If profit is sought for, in the production of eggs alone, one\r\ncock--if a stout, young, and lively bird--may have as many as\r\ntwenty-four hens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGHTING COCKS.]\r\n\r\n_The choice of a cock_ is a very important thing. He is considered to\r\nhave every requisite quality when he is of a good middling size; carries\r\nhis head high; has a quick, animated look; a strong and shrill voice; a\r\nfine red comb, shining as if varnished; wattles of a large size, and of\r\nthe same color as the comb; the breast broad; the wings strong; the\r\nplumage black or of an obscure red; the thighs very muscular; the legs\r\nthick, and furnished with strong spurs; and the claws rather bent and\r\nsharply pointed. He ought, also, to be free in his motions, to crow\r\nfrequently, and to scratch the ground often in search of worms, not so\r\nmuch for himself as to treat his hens. He ought, withal, to be brisk,\r\nspirited, ardent, and ready in caressing the hens; quick in defending\r\nthem, attentive in soliciting them to eat, in keeping them together, and\r\nin assembling them at night.\r\n\r\nIn breeding _game cocks_, the qualities required are every mark of\r\nperfect health, such as a ruddy complexion; the feathers close, short,\r\nand not feeling cold or dry; the flesh firm and compact; and a full\r\nbreast, betokening good lungs; a tapering and thinness behind. He should\r\nbe full in the girth, well coupled, lofty and aspiring, with a good\r\nthigh, the beam of his leg very strong, the eye large and vivid, and the\r\nbeak strong, crooked, and thick at the base.\r\n\r\nA cock is in his prime at two years old; though cocks are sometimes so\r\nprecocious as to show every mark of full vigor at four months, while\r\nothers of the same brood do not appear in that state for several months\r\nafterward. When marks of declining vigor are perceived, the cock must be\r\ndisplaced, to make way for a successor, which should be chosen from\r\namong the finest and bravest of the supernumerary young cocks, that\r\nought to be reared for this special purpose.\r\n\r\nThe change of cocks is of much importance, and is frequently very\r\ntroublesome to manage; for peace does not long subsist between them when\r\nthey hold a divided dominion in the poultry-yard, since they are all\r\nactuated by a restless, jealous, hasty, fiery, ardent disposition; and\r\nhence their quarrels become no less frequent than sanguinary. A battle\r\nsoon succeeds to provocation or affront. The two opponents face each\r\nother, their feathers bristling up, their necks stretched out, their\r\nheads low, and their beaks ready for the onslaught. They observe each\r\nother in silence, with fixed and sparkling eyes. On the least motion of\r\neither, they stand stiffly up, and rush furiously forward, dashing at\r\neach other with beak and spur in repeated sallies, till the more\r\npowerful or the more adroit has grievously torn the comb and wattles of\r\nhis adversary, has thrown him down by the heavy stroke of his wings, or\r\nhas stabbed him with his spurs.\r\n\r\nIn _the choice of a hen_ for sitting, a large bird should be selected,\r\nwith large, wide-spreading wings. Though large, she must not, however,\r\nbe heavy nor leggy. No one of judgment would sit a Malay; as, in such\r\ncase, not only would many eggs remain uncovered, but many, also, would\r\nbe trampled upon and broken. Elderly hens will be more willing to sit\r\nthan young and giddy pullets.\r\n\r\nAfter the common hen, which, on account of her fecundity, is deservedly\r\nesteemed, the tufted hens may be justly ranked; particularly from being\r\nmore delicate eating, because she fattens more readily, on account of\r\nlaying less. The large breed, though less prolific, is preferable in\r\nrearing chickens for the market, or for making capons. With regard to\r\nthese three kinds, the general opinion of breeders is, that the first is\r\nmore prolific in the number of eggs, while the others produce larger\r\nchickens, which bring good prices.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish fowl are not generally good sitters, but are excellent\r\nlayers; the Dorkings reverse the order, being better sitters than\r\nlayers. These qualities will be found to extend pretty generally to hens\r\npartaking of the prevailing colors of these two varieties; the black\r\nbeing usually the best layers, and but careless or indifferent sitters,\r\nwhile gray or checkered hens are the best that can be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING.\r\n\r\nExperiments have demonstrated that what may be called the gastric juice\r\nin fowls has not sufficient power to dissolve their food, without the\r\naid of the grinding action of the gizzard. Before the food is prepared\r\nfor digestion, therefore, the grains must be subjected to a triturating\r\nprocess; and such as are not sufficiently bruised in this manner, before\r\npassing into the gizzard, are there reduced to the proper state, by its\r\nnatural action. The action of the gizzard is, in this respect,\r\nmechanical; this organ serving as a mill to grind the food to pieces,\r\nand then, by means of its powerful muscles, pressing it gradually into\r\nthe intestines, in the form of pulp. The power of this organ is said to\r\nbe sufficient to pulverize hollow globules of glass in a very short\r\ntime, and solid masses of the same substance in a few weeks. The\r\nrapidity of this process seems to be proportionate, generally, to the\r\nsize of the bird. A chicken, for example, breaks up such substances as\r\nare received into its stomach less readily than the capon; while a goose\r\nperforms the same operation sooner than either. Needles, and even\r\nlancets, given to turkeys, have been broken in pieces and voided,\r\nwithout any apparent injury to the stomach. The reason, undoubtedly, is,\r\nthat the larger species of birds have thicker and more powerful organs\r\nof digestion.\r\n\r\nIt has long been the general opinion that, from some deficiency in the\r\ndigestive apparatus, fowls are obliged to resort to the use of stones\r\nand gravel, in order to enable them to dispose of the food which they\r\nconsume. Some have supposed that the use of these stones is to sheath\r\nthe gizzard, in order to fit it to break into smaller fragments the\r\nhard, angular substances which might be swallowed; they have also been\r\nconsidered to have a medicinal effect; others have imagined that they\r\nacted as absorbents for undue quantities of acids in the stomach, or as\r\nstimulants to digestion; while it has even been gravely asserted that\r\nthey contribute directly to nutrition.\r\n\r\nRepeated experiments, however, have established that pebbles are not at\r\nall necessary to the trituration of the hardest kinds of substances\r\nwhich can be introduced into their stomachs; and, of course, the usual\r\nfood of fowls can be bruised without their aid. They do, however, serve\r\na useful auxiliary purpose. When put in motion by the muscles, they are\r\ncapable of producing some effects upon the contents of the stomach; thus\r\nassisting to grind down the grain, and separating its parts, the\r\ndigestive fluid, or gastric juice, comes more readily in contact with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF FOOD. Fowls about a poultry-yard can usually pick up a\r\nportion of their subsistence, and, under favorable circumstances, the\r\nlargest portion. When so situated, the keeping of poultry pays decidedly\r\nthe best. The support even of poultry not designed for fattening should\r\nnot, however, be made to depend entirely upon such precarious resources.\r\nFowls should be fed with punctuality, faithfulness, and discretion.\r\n\r\nThey are fond of all sorts of grain--such as Indian corn, wheat, oats,\r\nrye, buckwheat, barley, millet, etc.; but their particular preferences\r\nare not so likely to guide in the selection of their food, as the\r\nconsideration of what is most economical, and easiest to be procured on\r\nthe part of their owner. They will readily eat most kinds of vegetables\r\nin their green state, both cooked and raw. They likewise manifest an\r\ninclination for animal food--such as blood, fish, and flesh--whether raw\r\nor otherwise; and seem by no means averse to feeding on their own\r\nspecies. Insects, worms, and snails they will take with avidity.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to give to domestic fowls a quantity of grain once, at\r\nleast, daily; but, commonly, in less quantity than they would consume,\r\nif unrestricted. They feed with great voracity; but their apparent\r\ngreediness is not the criterion by which the possibility of satisfying\r\nthem is to be judged. Moderate quantities of food will suffice; and the\r\namount consumed will usually be proportioned to the size of the\r\nindividuals. Whatever is cheapest, at any given time, may be given,\r\nwithout regard to any other considerations. Different circumstances and\r\ndifferent seasons may occasion a variation in their appetite; but a gill\r\nof grain is, generally speaking, about the usual daily portion. Some\r\nvery voracious fowls, of the largest size, will need the allowance of a\r\nthird of a pint each day.\r\n\r\n_Wheat_ is the most nutritive of cereal grains--with, perhaps, the\r\nexception of rice--as an article of human food. It is, therefore,\r\nnatural to suppose that it is the best for fowls; and the avidity with\r\nwhich they eat it would induce the conclusion that they would eat more\r\nof this than of any other grain. Yet it appears that when fowls have as\r\nmuch wheat as they can consume, they will eat about a fourth part less\r\nthan of oats, barley, or buckwheat; the largest quantity of wheat eaten\r\nby a fowl in one day being, according to several experiments, about\r\nthree-sixteenths of a pint. The difference in bulk is, however,\r\ncompensated by the difference in weight, these three-sixteenths of wheat\r\nweighing more than one-fourth of a pint of oats. The difference in\r\nweight is not, in every instance, the reason why a fowl is satisfied\r\nwith a larger or smaller measure of one sort than another. _Rye_ weighs\r\nless than wheat; but still a fowl will be satisfied with half the\r\nquantity of this grain. _Indian corn_ ranks intermediately between wheat\r\nand rye; five-fourths of a pint of Indian corn with fowls being found,\r\nby experiment, equal to six-fourths of wheat, and three-fourths of rye.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the quantity of grain daily consumed by the common fowl,\r\nit is wise to use data a little above than below the average. It may,\r\ntherefore, safely be said that a fowl of the common size, having free\r\naccess to as much as can be eaten through the day, will consume, day by\r\nday, of oats, buckwheat, or barley, one-fourth of a pint; of wheat,\r\nthree-sixteenths; of Indian corn, five thirty-seconds; and of rye, three\r\nthirty-seconds.\r\n\r\nIt has been conclusively settled, by experiments instituted to that end,\r\nthat there is the best economy in feeding poultry with _boiled_ grain\r\nrather than with dry, in every case where Indian corn, barley, and wheat\r\ncan be procured. The expense of fuel, and the additional trouble\r\nincident to the process of cooking, are inconsiderable in comparison\r\nwith the advantages derived. Where oats, buckwheat, or rye are used,\r\nboiling is useless, when profit is concerned.\r\n\r\nBRAN. It is an erroneous notion that money can be saved by feeding bran\r\nto fowls; since, then, so little of the farina of the grain remains in\r\nit, that the nourishment derived from its use is hardly worth\r\nmentioning. When boiled, as it always must be, its bulk is but slightly\r\nincreased. Two measures of dry bran, mixed with water, are equal to but\r\nthree-fifths of a measure of dry barley.\r\n\r\nMILLET. This is recommended as excellent food for young chickens. Fowls\r\nalways prefer it raw; though, as its bulk is increased one-half by\r\nboiling, it is doubtless more economical to feed it cooked.\r\n\r\nRICE. Fowls are especially fond of this food, although they soon lose\r\ntheir relish for it when allowed to have it at their discretion. It\r\nshould always be boiled; but its expense puts it out of the question as\r\na daily diet. When used continuously, it should always be mixed with\r\nsome substance containing less nutritive matter, in order that the\r\nappetite may not be cloyed by it.\r\n\r\nPOTATOES. These are very nutritious, and are usually acceptable to\r\nfowls, when properly prepared. When raw, or in a cold state, they appear\r\nto dislike them; they should, therefore, be boiled and given when\r\nmoderately hot; when very hot, it is said that fowls will injure\r\nthemselves by eating them, and burning their mouths. They should also be\r\nbroken into pieces of convenient size; otherwise, they will be avoided.\r\nOccasionally raw pieces of potato will be devoured; but fowls cannot be\r\nsaid to be fond of the root in this state. The same remark applies to\r\nmost other roots, especially to _carrots_ and _parsnips_; these should\r\nalways be prepared, in order to be wholesome and palatable. Fowls should\r\nnever be confined to a root diet, in any case; but such food should be\r\nmingled or alternated with a sufficient quantity of grain.\r\n\r\nGREEN FOOD. Indulgence in this kind of diet is absolutely necessary to\r\nthe health of fowls, and is also advantageous in an economical point of\r\nview. The more delicate kinds of green vegetables are eaten with the\r\nutmost avidity; all succulent weeds, grass, and the leaves of trees and\r\nshrubs will also be consumed. If hens have green plots to graze in\r\nduring the day, the expense of their keeping will be reduced one-half.\r\nAll the refuse of the kitchen, of a vegetable nature, should be freely\r\nthrown into the poultry-yard.\r\n\r\nGreen food, however, will not answer for an exclusive diet. Experiment\r\nhas shown that fowls fed with this food alone for a few days together\r\nexhibit severe symptoms of relaxation of the bowels; and, after the\r\nlapse of eight or nine days, their combs become pale and livid, which is\r\nthe same indication of disease in them that paleness of the lips is in\r\nthe human species.\r\n\r\nEARTH-WORMS. These are regarded as delicacies by the inhabitants of the\r\npoultry-yard; and the individual who is fortunate enough to capture one\r\nis often forced to undergo a severe ordeal in order to retain his\r\ncaptive. Earth-worms are more plentiful in moist land, such as pastures,\r\netc., than in that which is cultivated; in gardens, also, they exist in\r\nvast numbers. When it is desirable to take worms in quantities, it is\r\nonly necessary to thrust a stake or three-pronged fork into the ground,\r\nto the depth of about a foot, and to move it suddenly backward and\r\nforward, in order to shake the soil all around; the worms are\r\ninstinctively terrified by any motion in the ground, and, when\r\ndisturbed, hasten to the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to store worms, on account of the trouble and difficulty\r\nof making frequent collections. They may be placed in casks, filled\r\none-third full with earth, in quantities at least equal in bulk to the\r\nearth. The earth should be sprinkled occasionally, to prevent it from\r\nbecoming too dry. Care should, however, be exercised that the earth does\r\nnot become too moist; since, in such an event, the worms will perish. In\r\nrainy weather, the casks should be protected with a covering.\r\n\r\nANIMAL FOOD. Fowls readily eat both fish and flesh meat, and have no\r\nreluctance to feeding even on their own kind, picking much more\r\nfaithfully than quadrupeds. Blood of any kind is esteemed by them a\r\ndelicacy; and fish, even when salted, is devoured with a relish. They\r\nseem to be indifferent whether animal food is given to them in a cooked\r\nor raw state; though, if any preference can be detected, it is for the\r\nlatter. They are sometimes so greedy that they will attack each other in\r\norder to taste the blood which flows from the wounds so inflicted; and\r\nit is quite common for them, in the moulting season, to gratify\r\nthemselves by picking at the sprouting feathers on their own bodies and\r\nthose of their companions. They appear to be partial to suet and fat;\r\nbut they should not be allowed to devour these substances in large\r\nquantities, on account of their tendency to render them inconveniently\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nIt is highly advantageous to fowls to allow them a reasonable quantity\r\nof animal food for their diet, which should be fed to them in small\r\npieces, both for safety and convenience. Bones and meat may be boiled;\r\nand the liquor, when mixed with bran or meal, is healthy, and not\r\nexpensive.\r\n\r\nINSECTS. Fowls have a decided liking to flies, beetles, grasshoppers,\r\nand crickets; and grubs, caterpillars, and maggots are held by them in\r\nequal esteem. It is difficult, however, to supply the poultry-yard with\r\nthis species of food in sufficient quantity; but enough may be provided,\r\nprobably, to serve as luxuries. Some recommend that pailfuls of blood\r\nshould be thrown on dunghills, where fowls are allowed to run, for the\r\npurpose of enticing flies to deposit their eggs; which, when hatched,\r\nproduce swarms of maggots for the fowls. With the same view, any sort of\r\ngarbage or offal may be thrown out, if the dunghill is so situated--as\r\nit always should be--that its exhalations will not prove an annoyance.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary productiveness of a single individual of the family of\r\ndomestic fowls is astonishing. While few hens are capable of hatching\r\nmore than fifteen eggs, and are incapable usually of sitting more than\r\ntwice in the year, frequent instances have occurred of hens laying three\r\nhundred eggs annually, while two hundred is the average number. Some\r\nhens are accustomed to lay at longer intervals than others. The habit of\r\none variety is to lay once in three days only; others will lay every\r\nother day; and some produce an egg daily. The productiveness of hens\r\ndepends, undoubtedly, upon circumstances, to a great degree. Climate has\r\na great influence in this respect; and their lodging and food, as well\r\nas the care bestowed upon them, have more or less effect in promoting or\r\nobstructing their fecundity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE WATCH.]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be, naturally, two periods of the year in which fowls\r\nlay--early in the spring, and in the summer; and this fact would seem\r\nto indicate that, if they were left to themselves, like wild birds, they\r\nwould bring forth two broods in a year. The laying continues, with few\r\ninterruptions, till the close of summer, when the natural process of\r\nmoulting causes them to cease. This annual process commences about\r\nAugust, and continues through the three following months. The\r\nconstitutional effect attending the beginning, continuance, and\r\nconsequences of this period--a very critical one in the case of all\r\nfeathered animals--prevents them from laying, until its very close, when\r\nthe entire coat of new feathers replaces the old, the washing of the\r\nnutritive juices, yielded by the blood for the express purpose of\r\npromoting this growth, is a great drain upon the system; and the\r\nconstitutional forces, which would otherwise assist in forming the egg,\r\nare rendered inoperative. The approach of cold weather, also, at the\r\nclose of the moulting period, contributes to the same result. As the\r\nseason of moulting is every year later, the older the hen is, the later\r\nin the spring she will begin to lay. As pullets, on the contrary, do not\r\nmoult the first year, they commence laying sooner than the elder hens;\r\nand it is possible, by judicious and careful management, so to arrange,\r\nin a collection of poultry tolerably numerous, as to have eggs\r\nthroughout the year. It is a singular fact that pullets hatched very\r\nlate in autumn, and therefore of stunted growth, will lay nearly as\r\nearly as those hatched in spring. The checking of their growth seems to\r\nhave a tendency to produce eggs; of course, very tiny ones at first.\r\n\r\nWhen a hen is near to the time of laying, her comb and wattles change\r\nfrom their previous dull hue to a bright red, while the eye becomes more\r\nbright, the gait more spirited, and she occasionally cackles for three\r\nor four days. These signs rarely prove false; and when the time comes\r\nthat she desires to lay, she appears very restless, going backward and\r\nforward, visiting every nook and corner, cackling meanwhile, as if\r\ndispleased because she cannot suit herself with a convenient nest. Not\r\nhaving looked out for one previously, she rarely succeeds in pleasing\r\nherself till the moment comes when she can no longer tarry, when she is\r\ncompelled to choose one of the boxes or baskets provided for this\r\npurpose in the poultry-house, where she settles herself in silence and\r\nlays.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, a hen will make choice of a particular nest in which\r\nto lay, and when she finds, upon desiring to lay, that this is\r\npre-occupied by another hen, she will wait till it is vacated; but, in\r\nother cases, hens will go into any nest which they find, preferring, for\r\nthe most part, those having the greatest number of eggs. The process of\r\nlaying is, most probably, rather painful, though the hen does not\r\nindicate this by her cries; but the instant she has done she leaves the\r\nnest, and utters her joy by peculiarly loud notes, which are re-echoed\r\nby the cock, as well as by some of the other hens. Some hens, however,\r\nleave the nest in silence, after laying.\r\n\r\nIt seems ever to have been an object of great importance, in an\r\neconomical point of view, to secure the laying of hens during those\r\nparts of the year when, if left to themselves, they are indisposed to\r\ndeposit their eggs. For this purpose many methods have been devised, the\r\nmost of which embrace an increase of rich and stimulating food. Some\r\nrecommend shutting hens up in a warm place during winter, and giving\r\nthem boiled potatoes, turnips, carrots, and parsnips. Others assign as\r\nthe reason for their not laying in winter, in some climates, that the\r\nearth is covered with snow, so that they can find no ground, or other\r\ncalcareous matter, to form the shells; and advise, therefore, that bones\r\nof meat or poultry should be pounded and given to them, either mixed\r\nwith their food, or by itself, which they will greedily eat. Upon the\r\nwhole, it would seem that the most feasible means of obtaining fresh\r\neggs during the winter is to have young hens--pullets hatched only the\r\nprevious spring being the best--to use extreme liberality in feeding,\r\nand to cautiously abstain from over-stocking the poultry-yard.\r\n\r\nAs serviceable _food_ to increase laying, scraps of animal food, given\r\ntwo or three times a week, answer admirably; the best mode of doing so\r\nis throwing down a bullock's liver, leaving it with them, and permitting\r\nthem to pick it at will; this is better raw than boiled. Lights, or\r\nguts, or any other animal refuse, will be found to answer the same\r\npurpose; but these substances require, or, at all events, are better\r\nfor, boiling. Cayenne pepper--in fact all descriptions of pepper, but\r\nespecially cayenne pepper in pods--is a favorite food with fowls; and,\r\nbeing a powerful stimulant, it promotes laying.\r\n\r\nAn abundant supply of lime, in some form, should not be omitted; either\r\nchopped bones, old mortar, or a lump of chalky marl. The shell of every\r\negg used in the house should be roughly crushed and thrown down to the\r\nhens, which will greedily eat them. A green, living turf will be of\r\nservice, both for its grass and the insects it may contain. A\r\ndusting-place, wherein to get rid of vermin, is indispensable. A daily\r\nhot meal of potatoes, boiled as carefully as for the family table, then\r\nchopped, and sprinkled or mixed with bran, will be comfortable and\r\nstimulating. After every meal of the household, the bones and other\r\nscraps should be collected and thrown out.\r\n\r\nAs to _the number of eggs_, the varieties which possess the greatest\r\nfecundity are the Shanghaes, Guelderlands, Dorkings, Polish, and\r\nSpanish. The Poland and Spanish lay the largest eggs; the Dorkings, eggs\r\nof good size; while the Game and the smaller kinds produce only small\r\neggs. Those eggs which have the brightest yolks are the finest flavored;\r\nand this is usually the case with the smaller kinds. The large eggs of\r\nthe larger varieties often have yolks of a pale color, and are inferior\r\nin flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF EGGS.\r\n\r\nEggs, after being laid, lose daily, by transpiration, a portion of the\r\nmatter which they contain, notwithstanding the compact texture of their\r\nshell, and of the close tissue of the flexible membranes lining the\r\nshell, and enveloping the white. When an egg is fresh, it is full,\r\nwithout any vacancy; and this is a matter of common observation, whether\r\nit be broken raw, or when it is either soft or hard-boiled. In all stale\r\neggs, on the contrary, there is uniformly more or less vacancy,\r\nproportioned to the loss they have sustained by transpiration; hence,\r\nin order to judge of the freshness of an egg, it is usual to hold it up\r\nto the light, when the transparency of the shell makes it appear whether\r\nor not there is any vacancy in the upper portion, as well as whether the\r\nyolk and white are mingled and muddy, by the rotting and bursting of\r\ntheir enveloping membranes.\r\n\r\nThe transpiration of eggs, besides, is proportional to the temperature\r\nin which they are placed, cold retarding and heat promoting the process;\r\nhence, by keeping fresh-lain eggs in a cool cellar, or, better still, in\r\nan ice-house, they will transpire less, and be preserved for a longer\r\nperiod sound, than if they are kept in a warm place, or exposed to the\r\nsun's light, which has also a good effect in promoting the exhalation of\r\nmoisture. As, therefore, fermentation and putridity can only take place\r\nby communication with the air at a moderate temperature, such connection\r\nmust be excluded by closing the pores of the shell.\r\n\r\nIt is an indispensable condition of the material used for this purpose,\r\nthat it shall be incapable of being dissolved by the moisture transpired\r\nfrom the interior. Spirits of wine varnish, made with lac, answers the\r\nrequirement; this is not very expensive, but is rather an uncommon\r\narticle in country places, where eggs are most abundantly produced.\r\n\r\nA better material is a mixture of mutton and beef suet, which should be\r\nmelted together over a slow fire, and strained through a linen cloth\r\ninto an earthen pan. The chief advantage in the use of this is, that the\r\neggs rubbed over with it will boil as quickly as if nothing had been\r\ndone to them, the fat melting off as soon as they touch the water. The\r\ntranspiration is as effectually stopped by the thinnest layer of fat as\r\nby a thick coating, provided that no sensible vestige be left on the\r\nsurface of the shell. All sorts of fat, grease, or oil are well adapted\r\nto this purpose; by means of butter, hog's lard, olive oil, and similar\r\nsubstances, eggs maybe preserved for nine months as fresh as the day\r\nupon which they were laid.\r\n\r\nAnother method is, to dip each egg into melted pork-lard, rubbing it\r\ninto the shell with the finger, and pack them in old fig-drums, or\r\nbutter firkins, setting every egg upright, with the small end downward.\r\nOr, the eggs may be packed in the same way in an upright earthen pan;\r\nthen cut some rough sheep's tallow, procured the same day that the\r\nanimal is killed, into small pieces, and melt it down; strain it from\r\nthe scraps, and pour it while warm, not hot, over the eggs in the jar\r\ntill they are completely covered. When all is cold and firm, set the\r\nvessel in a cool, dry place till the contents are wanted.\r\n\r\nEggs will also keep well when preserved in salt, by arranging them in a\r\nbarrel, first a layer of salt, then a layer of eggs, alternately. This\r\ncan, however, also act mechanically, like bran or saw-dust, so long as\r\nthe salt continues dry; for, in that case, the chlorine, which is the\r\nantiseptic principle of the salt, is not evolved. When the salt,\r\nhowever, becomes damp, its preservative principle will be brought into\r\naction, and may penetrate through the pores of the shell.\r\n\r\nImmersing eggs in vitriol, or sulphuric acid, is likewise a very\r\neffectual means of preserving them; the sulphuric acid acts chemically\r\nupon the carbonate of lime in the shell, by setting free the carbonic\r\nacid gas, while it unites with the lime, and forms sulphate of lime, or\r\nplaster of Paris. Another method is, to mix together a bushel of\r\nquick-lime, two pounds of salt, and eight ounces of cream of tartar,\r\nadding a sufficient quantity of water, so that eggs may be plunged into\r\nthe paint. When a paste is made of this consistence, the eggs are put\r\ninto it, and may be kept fresh, it is said, for two years.\r\n\r\nAnother method of preserving eggs a long while fresh, depends upon a\r\nvery different principle. Eggs that have not been rendered reproductive\r\nby the cock have been found to continue very uncorrupted. In order,\r\ntherefore, to have eggs keep fresh from spring to the middle or even to\r\nthe end of Winter, it is only necessary to deprive the hens of all\r\ncommunication with the cocks, for at least a month before the eggs are\r\nput away.\r\n\r\nIt ought not to be overlooked, in this connection, that eggs not only\r\nspoil by the transpiration of their moisture and the putrid fermentation\r\nof their contents, in consequence of air penetrating through the pores\r\nof the shell, but also by being moved about and jostled, when carried to\r\na distance by sea or land. Any kind of rough motion, indeed, ruptures\r\nthe membranes which keep the white, the yolk, and the germ of the\r\nchicken in their appropriate places; and, upon these being mixed,\r\nputrefaction is promoted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF EGGS FOR SETTING.\r\n\r\nEggs for hatching should be as fresh as possible; if laid the very same\r\nday, so much the better. This is not always possible when a particular\r\nstock is required; but, if a numerous and healthy brood is all that is\r\nwanted, the most recent eggs should be selected. Eggs may be kept for\r\nthis purpose in either of the ways first mentioned; or they may be\r\nplaced on their points in a box, in a cool, dry place; the temperature\r\nabout sixty or sixty-five, Fahrenheit; the bottom of the box should be\r\ncovered with a layer of wheat bran, then a layer of eggs put in, and\r\ncovered with bran; and so on, alternating. In this mode, evaporation is\r\nprevented, and the eggs are almost as certain to hatch out, at the end\r\nof six weeks, or even two months, as when they were laid.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to fix the exact term during which the vitality of an\r\negg remains unextinguished; as it, unquestionably, varies from the very\r\nfirst, according to the vigor of the parents of the inclosed germ, and\r\nfades away gradually till the final moment of non-existence. The\r\nchickens in stale eggs have not sufficient strength to extricate\r\nthemselves from the shell; if assisted, the yolk is found to be\r\npartially absorbed into the abdomen, or not at all; they are too faint\r\nto stand; the muscles of the neck are unable to lift their heads, much\r\nless to peck; and although they may sometimes be saved by extreme care,\r\ntheir usual fate is to be trampled to death by the mother, if they do\r\nnot expire almost as soon as they begin to draw their breath.\r\nThick-shelled eggs, like those of geese, Guinea fowls, etc., will retain\r\nlife longer than thin-shelled ones, as those of hens and ducks. When\r\nchoice eggs are expected to be laid, it is more prudent to have the hen\r\nwhich is to sit upon them wait for them, than to keep other eggs waiting\r\nfor her. A good sitter may be amused for two or three weeks with a few\r\naddle-eggs, and so be ready to take charge of those of value immediately\r\nupon their arrival.\r\n\r\nAs to the choice of eggs for hatching, such should be taken, of course,\r\nas are believed to have been rendered productive. Those of medium\r\nsize--the average size that the hen lays--are most apt to fulfil this\r\nrequirement. A very fair judgment may be formed of eggs from their\r\nspecific gravity; such as do not sink to the bottom in a bowl of tepid\r\nwater should be rejected.\r\n\r\nThe old-time notion, that small, round eggs produce females, and long,\r\npointed ones males--originally applied, by the ancients, to eating\r\nrather than hatching purposes--may be considered exploded. The hen that\r\nlays one round egg, continues to lay all her eggs round; and the hen\r\nthat lays one oblong, lays all oblong. According to this theory, then,\r\none hen would be the perpetual mother of cocks, and another the\r\nperpetual producer of pullets; which is absurd, as daily experience\r\nproves.\r\n\r\nThe same fate has been meted out to that other venerable test of sex,\r\nthe position of the air-bag at the blunt end of the shell. \"If the\r\nvacancy is a little on one side, it will produce a hen; if it is exactly\r\nin the centre, a cock.\" Upon this assumption, the cock should be a very\r\nrare bird; since there are very few eggs indeed in which the air bottle\r\nis exactly concentric with the axis of the egg. In many breeds, on the\r\ncontrary, the cockerels bear a proportion of at least one-third, and\r\nsometimes two-thirds, especially in those hatched during winter, or in\r\nunfavorable seasons; the immediate cause, doubtless, being that the eggs\r\nproducing a more robust sex possess a stronger vitality.\r\n\r\nNor are these two alleged tests--the shape of the egg, and the position\r\nof the air-tube--consistent with each other; for, if the round egg\r\nproduces a pullet, and an egg with the air-bag a little on one side does\r\nthe same, then all round eggs should have the air bag in that position,\r\nor one test contradicts the other; and the same argument applies to the\r\nlong or oval egg. The examination of a few eggs by the light of a candle\r\nwill satisfy any one that the position of the air-bag differs as much\r\nin a long egg as it does in a round.\r\n\r\nThere are, indeed, no known means of determining beforehand the sex of\r\nfowl; except, perhaps, that cocks may be more likely to issue from large\r\neggs, and hens from small ones. As, however, the egg of each hen may be\r\nrecognized, the means are accessible of propagating from those parents\r\nwhose race it is judged most desirable to continue.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUBATION.\r\n\r\nThe hen manifests the desire of incubation in a manner different from\r\nthat of any other known bird. Nature having been sufficiently tasked in\r\none direction, she becomes feverish, and loses flesh; her comb is livid;\r\nher eyes are dull; she bristles her feathers to intimidate an imaginary\r\nenemy; and, as if her chickens were already around her, utters the\r\nmaternal \"cluck.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the determination to sit becomes fixed--it is not necessary to\r\nimmediately gratify the first faint inclinations--the nest which she has\r\nselected should be well cleaned, and filled with fresh straw. The number\r\nof eggs to be allowed will depend upon the season, and upon the size of\r\negg and hen. The wisest plan is not to be too greedy; the number of\r\nchickens hatched is often in inverse proportion to the number of eggs\r\nset--five have only been obtained from sixteen. An odd number is,\r\nhowever, to be preferred, as being better adapted to covering in the\r\nnest. Hens will, in general, well cover from eleven to thirteen eggs\r\nlaid by themselves. A bantam may be trusted with about half a dozen eggs\r\nof a large breed, such as the Spanish. A hen of the largest size as a\r\nDorking, will successfully hatch, at the most, five goose-eggs.\r\n\r\nWhen hens are determined to sit at seasons of the year at which there is\r\nlittle chance of bringing up chickens, the eggs of ducks or geese may be\r\nfurnished her; the young may be reared, with a little painstaking, at\r\nany time of the year. The autumnal laying of the China and of the common\r\ngoose is very valuable for this purpose. Turkey-hens frequently have\r\nthis fit of unseasonable incubation.\r\n\r\nWhere, however, it is inconvenient to gratify the desire, one or two\r\ndoses of jalap will often entirely remove it; and fowls often lay in\r\nthree weeks afterward. Some place the would-be sitter in an aviary, for\r\nfour or five days at most, and feed her but sparingly; from the\r\ncommencement of her confinement, she will gradually leave off clucking,\r\nand when this has ceased, she may be again set free, without manifesting\r\nthe least desire to take to the nest again, and in a short time the hen\r\nwill commence laying with renewed vigor. The barbarous measures\r\nsometimes resorted to should be frowned upon by every person with humane\r\nfeelings.\r\n\r\nThree weeks is the period of incubation; though chickens are sometimes\r\nexcluded on the eighteenth day. When the hen does not sit close for the\r\nfirst day or two, or in early spring, it will occasionally be some hours\r\nlonger; when the hen is assiduous, and the weather hot, the time will be\r\na trifle shorter. Chickens have been known to come out as late as the\r\ntwenty-seventh day.\r\n\r\nIt may not be uninteresting to note the changes which the egg passes\r\nthrough in hatching. In _twelve hours_, traces of the head and body of\r\nthe chicken may be discerned; at the end of the _second day_, it\r\nassumes the form of a horse-shoe, but no red blood as yet is seen; at\r\nthe _fiftieth hour_, two vesicles of blood, the rudiments of the heart,\r\nmay be distinguished, one resembling a noose folded down on itself, and\r\npulsating distinctly; at the end of _seventy hours_, the wings may be\r\nseen, and, in the head, the brain and the bill, in the form of bubbles;\r\ntoward the end of the _fourth day_, the heart is more completely formed;\r\nand on the _fifth day_, the liver is discernible; at the end of _one\r\nhundred and thirty hours_, the first voluntary motions may be observed;\r\nin _seven hours_ more, the lungs and stomach appear; and, _in four\r\nhours_ after this, the intestines, the loins, and the upper jaw. At the\r\nend of the one _hundred and forty-fourth hour_, two drops of blood are\r\nobservable in the heart, which is also further developed; and, on the\r\n_seventh day_, the brain exhibits some consistence. At the _one hundred\r\nand ninetieth hour_, the bill opens, and the muscular flesh appears on\r\nthe breast; in _four hours_ more, the breast bone is seen; and, in _six\r\nhours_ afterward, the ribs may be observed forming from the back. At the\r\nexpiration of _two hundred and thirty-six hours_, the bill assumes a\r\ngreen color, and, if the chicken be taken out of the egg, it will\r\nvisibly move. At _two hundred and sixty-four hours_, the eyes appear; at\r\n_two hundred and eighty-eight hours_, the ribs are perfect; and _at\r\nthree hundred and thirty-one hours_, the spleen approaches near to the\r\nstomach, and the lungs to the chest; at the end of _three hundred and\r\nfifty-five hours_, the bill frequently opens and shuts. At the end of\r\nthe _eighteenth day_, the first cry of the chicken is heard; and it\r\ngradually acquires more strength, till it is enabled to release itself\r\nfrom confinement.\r\n\r\nAfter the hen has set a week, the fertility of the eggs may be\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained by taking a thin board with a small orifice\r\nin it, placing a candle at the back, and holding up each egg to the\r\npoints of light. The barren eggs may then be removed, and used,\r\nhard-boiled, for young chickens. Some reserve this for the eleventh or\r\ntwelfth day.\r\n\r\nAbout the _twenty-first day_, the chicken is excluded from the _egg_;\r\nfor the purpose of breaking the shell of which it is furnished with a\r\nhorny-pointed scale, greatly harder than the bill itself, at the upper\r\ntip of the bill--a scale which falls off, or becomes absorbed, after the\r\nchicken is two or three days old. The chicken is rolled up in the egg in\r\nthe form of a ball, with its forepart toward the highest end, and its\r\nbeak uppermost, the hard scale nearly touching the shell.\r\n\r\nThe first few strokes of the chicken's beak produce a small crack,\r\nrather nearer the larger than the smaller end of the egg, and the egg is\r\nsaid to be _chipped_. From the first crack, the chicken turns gradually\r\nround, from left to right, chipping the shell as it turns, in a circular\r\nmanner, never obliquely. All do not succeed in producing the result in\r\nthe same time; some being able to complete the work within an hour, and\r\nothers taking two or three hours, while half a day is most usually\r\nemployed, and some require twenty-four hours or more, but rarely two\r\ndays. Some have greater obstacles to overcome than others, all shells\r\nnot being alike in thickness and hardness.\r\n\r\nWhen chickens do not effect their escape easily, some little assistance\r\nis needed; but the difficulty is to know when to give it, as a rash\r\nattempt to help them, by breaking the shell, particularly in a downward\r\ndirection toward the smaller end, is often followed by a loss of blood,\r\nwhich can ill be spared. It is better not to interfere, until it is\r\napparent that a part of the brood have been hatched for some time, say\r\ntwelve hours, and that the rest cannot succeed in making their\r\nappearance. It will then generally be found that the whole fluid\r\ncontents of the egg, yolk and all, are taken up into the body of the\r\nchicken, and that weakness alone has prevented its forcing itself out.\r\nThe causes of such weakness are various; sometimes, insufficient warmth,\r\nfrom the hen having set on too many eggs; sometimes the original\r\nfeebleness of the vital spark; but, most frequently, the staleness of\r\nthe eggs employed for incubation.\r\n\r\nThe chances of rearing such chickens are small; but, if they survive the\r\nfirst twenty-four hours, they may be considered as safe. The only thing\r\nto be done is to take them from the hen till she is settled at night,\r\nkeeping them in the meanwhile as snug and warm as possible. If a gentle\r\nhand can persuade a crust of bread down their throats, it will do no\r\nharm; but all rough and clumsy manipulation will utterly defeat the end\r\nin view. Animal heat will be their greatest restorative. At night, they\r\nshould be quietly slipped under their mother; the next morning will\r\ndisclose the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation in the _Guinea fowl_ is twenty-eight days, or\r\none month; in the _pea fowl_, from twenty-seven to twenty-nine days; in\r\n_turkeys_, a month; in _ducks_, thirty or thirty-one days; and in\r\n_geese_, from twenty-seven to thirty days.\r\n\r\nINCUBATION OF TURKEYS. When the turkey hen has once selected a spot for\r\nher nest, she will continue to lay there till the time for incubation;\r\nso that the egg may be brought home from day to day, there being no\r\nneed of a nest-egg, as with the domestic fowl. She will lay from fifteen\r\nto twenty eggs, more or less. If there are any dead leaves or dry grass\r\nat hand, she will cover her eggs with these; but if not, she will take\r\nno trouble to collect them from a distance.\r\n\r\nHer determination to sit will be known by her constantly remaining on\r\nthe nest, though it is empty; and, as it is seldom in a position\r\nsufficiently secure against the weather or pilferers, a nest should be\r\nprepared for her, by placing some straw, with her eggs, on the floor of\r\na convenient out-building. She should then be brought home, and gently\r\nand kindly placed upon it. With the smallest varieties, thirteen eggs\r\nwill suffice; a large hen might cover more. At the end of a week, it is\r\nusual to add some fowls' eggs; the activity of the chickens excites some\r\nemulation in the larger brethren, and the eggs take up but little room\r\nin the nest.\r\n\r\nSome believe it necessary to turn the eggs once a day; but the hen\r\nherself does that many times daily. If the eggs are marked, and their\r\nposition noticed when she leaves the nest, they will never be found in\r\nthe same order. In about four weeks, the young will be hatched.\r\n\r\nINCUBATION OF GEESE. Geese breed in general only once a year; but, if\r\nwell kept, they sometimes hatch twice a season. During the sitting, in\r\nsections where the most attention is paid to breeding them, each bird\r\nhas a space allotted to it, in rows of wicker-pens, placed one above\r\nanother, and the person in charge of them drives the whole flock to\r\nwater three times a day, and, bringing them back to their habitations,\r\nplaces each bird in its own nest.\r\n\r\nThe most successful breeders of _Bremen geese_ adopt the following\r\nmethod: The birds are, in the first place, carefully and properly fed;\r\nthe eggs are removed every day in the gentlest manner from the nest, and\r\nplaced in a basket of cotton kept in a moderate temperature, and free\r\nfrom damp. When all the geese begin to sit steadily, each is furnished\r\nwith a nest composed of chopped straw; and care is taken that it is\r\nsufficiently capacious.\r\n\r\nNot more than one of the geese is allowed to leave the eggs at a time.\r\nAs soon as one leaves, she makes a cackling noise, which is the signal\r\nfor the attendant to shut up the boxes in which the others are sitting.\r\nThese are made somewhat like a dog-kennel, with a roof pitched both\r\nways; and are thirty inches long, by twenty-four wide, and twenty-four\r\nhigh; the door is in the end, and is covered by a sliding panel, which\r\nmoves upward, when egress or ingress is sought, and may be shut down at\r\npleasure. The goose, upon returning, finds only her own box open. When\r\nshe re-enters her box, the whole of the doors are again opened, and the\r\nsame rule observed throughout the period of hatching. In this way, each\r\ngoose is kept to its own nest.\r\n\r\n\r\nREARING OF THE YOUNG.\r\n\r\nFor about twenty-four hours after birth, the chickens can not only do\r\nwell enough without any extraneous nourishment, but will be far more\r\nlikely to thrive subsequently, if let alone, than if crammed or incited\r\nto eat prematurely. More chickens are destroyed by over-feeding than are\r\nlost by the want of it. It is, however, well to turn them in among other\r\nchickens that already feed themselves; they will, in such cases,\r\ngenerally follow the example of the rest, and pick away at whatever is\r\naround.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARQUEE OR TENT-SHADED COOPS.]\r\n\r\nA roomy, boarded coop, in a dry, sunny spot, is the best position for\r\nthem during the first month; after which it may be left open during the\r\nday, for the hen to retire to when she pleases. In quiet grassy places,\r\nit is scarcely necessary to coop the hen at all. As to food, they may\r\nhave every thing which is not absolutely poisonous; though if wet food\r\nis given, the chicken is thus obliged to take water, whether it requires\r\nit or not, in order to get a sufficient supply of solid food, and\r\ndiseased bowels will be likely to follow; whereas, if the food is dry,\r\nthey can supply themselves with food and water according to their\r\npleasure. If Indian meal is well boiled, and fed not too moist, it will\r\nanswer a very good purpose, particularly after they are eight or ten\r\ndays old. Pure water must be placed near them in such a manner as to\r\nenable them to drink without getting into the water, which, by wetting\r\ntheir feathers, benumbs and injures them. Meat and insect diet are\r\nalmost necessary; but, whatever the food, the meals must be given at\r\nshort intervals; as much as they can swallow, and as often as they can\r\neat. With all their industry, they are only half-clad till flesh and\r\nbone stop growing for a while, and allow down and feathers to overtake\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nChickens should not be let out of their coops too early in the morning,\r\nor whilst the dew is on the ground; still less should they be suffered\r\nto range over the wet grass, which is a common cause of disease and\r\ndeath. They should also be guarded against sudden unfavorable changes of\r\nthe weather, more particularly if attended with rain. Nearly all the\r\ndiseases of gallinaceous fowls arise from cold moisture.\r\n\r\nThe period at which they are left to shift for themselves depends upon\r\nthe disposition of the hen. Some will continue their attentions to their\r\nchickens till they are nearly full-grown, while others will cast them\r\noff much earlier. In the latter case, an eye should be kept upon them\r\nfor a few days; for chickens in this half-grown state are much more\r\nliable to disease than when they were apparently tender little\r\nweaklings, crowded under their mother's wings. They should be kept in a\r\ndry, warm, place; dryness is especially necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the chickens feather rapidly when very young--as is the case with the\r\nGolden Pheasant, Black Poland, Guelderland, and some others--they are\r\nalways weakly, however healthy in other respects, from the fact that\r\ntheir food goes to sustain their feathers rather than their bodies; and\r\nthey frequently languish and die, from this circumstance alone. If, on\r\nthe other hand, they feather slowly, as do the Cochin Chinas, Shanghaes,\r\nand others, the food in early life goes to nourish and sustain their\r\nbodies until they become more vigorous, and old enough to sustain the\r\nshock of feathering without detriment. Pure tan-colored Dorkings are\r\nmore easily raised than others of the race, because they feather more\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nChickens which feather rapidly must be kept perfectly dry and warm, or\r\nthey will die; while naked chickens, as they are termed, or those which\r\nfeather at a more advanced age, and very slowly, seldom suffer from the\r\ncold, from the fact that their down is very warm, and their blood is\r\nhotter, and circulates more rapidly; since their food principally goes\r\nto blood, and flesh, and bones, and not to feathers.\r\n\r\nREARING OF GUINEA FOWLS. For the young of these, ants' eggs, so called,\r\nhard-boiled eggs chopped fine, small worms, maggots, bread-crumbs,\r\nchopped meat, or suet--whatever, in short, is most nutritious, is the\r\nmost appropriate food. This need not be offered to them in large\r\nquantities, as it would only be devoured by the mother Bantam as soon as\r\nshe saw that they had for the time satisfied their appetites, or it\r\nwould be stolen by other birds; but it should frequently be administered\r\nto them in small supplies. Feeding them three, four, or five times a\r\nday, is not often enough; every half hour during daylight they should be\r\ntempted to fill their craws, which are soon emptied again by an\r\nextraordinary power and quickness of digestion.\r\n\r\nThe newly-hatched Guinea fowl is a tiny creature, and its growth is,\r\nconsequently, very rapid, requiring incessant supplies. A check once\r\nreceived can never be recovered. They do not, in such cases, mope and\r\npine for a day or two; like young turkeys under similar circumstances,\r\nand then die; but, in half an hour after being in apparent health, they\r\nfall on their backs, give a convulsive kick or two, and fall victims, in\r\nfact, to starvation. The demands of Nature for the growth of bone,\r\nmuscle, and particularly of feathers, are so great, that no subsequent\r\nabundant supply of food can compensate for a fast of a couple of hours.\r\nThe feathers still go on growing in geometrical progression, and drawing\r\nthe sources of vitality still faster than they can be supplied, till the\r\nbird faints and expires from inanition.\r\n\r\nA dry, sunny corner in the garden will be the best place to coop them\r\nwith their bantam hen. As they increase in strength, they will do no\r\nharm, but much good, by devouring worms, grubs, caterpillars, maggots,\r\nand all sorts of insects. By the time their bodies are little longer\r\nthan those of sparrows, they will be able to fly with some degree of\r\nstrength; other additions to their complete stature are successively and\r\nless immediately developed, the spurs, comb, and ornamental plumage not\r\nappearing till a subsequent period.\r\n\r\nWhen they are about the size of thrushes, or a little larger, unless the\r\nsummer be very fine, the bantam may be allowed to range loose in the\r\norchard and shrubbery, and no longer permitted to enter the garden. The\r\nyoung must, however, still receive a bountiful and frequent supply of\r\nfood; they are not to be considered safe till the horn on their head is\r\nfairly grown. Oatmeal is a great treat; cooked potatoes, boiled rice, or\r\nany thing, in short, that is eatable, may be thrown to them; they will\r\npick the bones left after dinner with evident satisfaction. The tamer\r\nthey can be made, the less troublesome will they be when grown; the more\r\nkindly they are treated, the fatter will they be for food, and the\r\nbetter price will they bring in market.\r\n\r\nFor rearing the young of the _pea fowl_, the same directions will be\r\nfound useful, and should be carried out in practice.\r\n\r\nREARING OF TURKEYS. Much quackery has been recommended in the treatment\r\nof young turkeys. Nothing, however, should be given to them, nothing\r\ndone for them; they should remain in the nest, under the shelter of\r\ntheir mother's wings, for at least eight or ten hours; if hatched in the\r\nafternoon, till the following morning. The hen should then be placed on\r\nthe grass, in the sun, under a roomy coop. If the weather is fine, she\r\nmay be stationed at any point desired, by a long piece of flannel-list\r\ntied round one leg, and fastened to a stump or stone.\r\n\r\nAt first, a few crumbs of bread should be offered; for some hours, the\r\nlittle ones will be in no hurry to eat; but, when they do commence, they\r\nshould be supplied constantly and abundantly with chopped egg, shreds of\r\nmeat and fat, curd, boiled rice mixed with cress, lettuce, and the green\r\nof onions; melted mutton-suet poured over barley-meal, and cut up when\r\ncold, as also bullock's liver boiled and minced, are excellent things.\r\nYoung turkeys do not like to have their food minced much smaller than\r\nthey can swallow it, preferring to make a meal at three or four\r\nmouthfuls, rather than to trouble themselves with the incessant pecking\r\nand scratching in which chickens so much delight. Pepper will be found\r\nparticularly useful in feeding them; as, indeed, all stimulating\r\nvegetables, such as horse-radish, and the like.\r\n\r\nYoung turkeys are sometimes attacked by _fasciolae_, or worms in the\r\ntrachea; but not so often as chickens. Cramp is the most fatal to them,\r\nparticularly in bad weather. A few pieces of board laid under and about\r\nthe coop are useful; sometimes rubbing the leg with spirit will bring\r\nback the circulation.\r\n\r\nThe time when the hen may be allowed full liberty with her brood depends\r\nmost upon the season, the situation, etc. Some think that if the young\r\nare thriving, the sooner the old ones are out with them the better,\r\nafter the first ten days or so. A safer rule may be fixed at the season,\r\ncalled \"shooting the red,\" when young turkeys approach the size of a\r\npartridge, or before the granular, fleshy excrescences on the head and\r\nneck begin to appear; soon after, the whole plumage, particularly the\r\ntail-feathers, shoot into rapid growth, and liberal nourishment is\r\nimperatively required. If let loose at this time, they will obtain much\r\nforaging, and still be thankful for all that is given to them.\r\nCaraway-seeds, as a tonic, are beneficial, if added to plenty of barley,\r\nboiled potatoes, chopped vegetables, and refuse meat. At this time the\r\nturkeys, naturally enough, begin to be troublesome and voracious; they\r\nhave to grow from the size of a lark to twelve or fourteen pounds, in\r\neight or nine months. One great merit in old birds is, that in\r\nsituations where nuts, acorns, and mast are to be had, they will lead\r\noff their brood to these, and all of them will abstain, comparatively,\r\nfrom ravaging other crops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUCK-POND AND HOUSES.]\r\n\r\nREARING OF DUCKLINGS. The best mode of rearing the young of ducks\r\ndepends very much upon the situation in which they are hatched. It is\r\ncustomary to dip their feet in water as soon as they are hatched, and\r\nthen to clip the down on their tails close with a pair of scissors, to\r\nprevent their becoming drabbled and water-logged; and before their\r\nintroduction to the pond, which should not be until a day or two after\r\nhatching, it is thought advisable by many to let them have a private\r\nswim or two in a small pan of water, that they may try their strength\r\nand practice their webbed feet before venturing upon a larger space.\r\n\r\nFor the first month, the confinement of the mother under a coop is\r\nbetter than too much liberty. Their first food may be boiled eggs,\r\nnettles, and a little barley; all kinds of sapped food, cornmeal and\r\nwater mixed thin, worms, etc., suit them; they will also greedily eat\r\ncabbages or other greens, mixed with boiled bran; and this mess, with\r\nthe addition of pepper, forms a valuable dietetic. In a few days, they\r\nrequire no care, being perfectly able to shift for themselves; but at\r\nany age they are the most helpless of the inhabitants of the\r\npoultry-yard, having no weapons with which to defend themselves from\r\nvermin, or animals of prey, and their awkward, waddling gait precluding\r\ntheir seeking safety in flight. The old duck is not so brave in defence\r\nof her brood as the hen; but she will, nevertheless, display at times\r\nmuch spirit. The young seldom die of any disease, and with proper\r\nprecaution there will be no trouble in raising almost as many ducklings\r\nas are hatched. They come early to maturity, being nearly full-grown and\r\nin fine eating order at three months old; far excelling, in this\r\nrespect, all other poultry, except geese.\r\n\r\nNone are more successful in rearing ducklings than those who keep them,\r\nfor the first period of their existence, in pens two or three yards\r\nsquare, and cram them night and morning with long, dried pellets of\r\nflour and water, or egg and flour, until they are judged old enough to\r\nbe turned out with their mother to forage for themselves. They are\r\ncheerful, harmless, good-natured, cleanly creatures, carefully washing\r\nthemselves, and arranging their dress, before commencing their meals;\r\nand the healthy heartiness of their appetite is amusing, rather than\r\ndisgusting.\r\n\r\nREARING OF GOSLINGS. For the first three or four days, goslings must be\r\nkept warm and dry, and fed on barley-meal, or oatmeal, mixed with milk,\r\nif easily procurable; if not, with water. They will begin to grow in\r\nabout a week. For a week or two, they should not be turned out until\r\nlate in the morning, and should always be taken in early in the evening.\r\nTheir great enemy is the cramp, which can be kept off by making them\r\nsleep on dry straw. A little boiled rice, daily, assists their growth;\r\nwith corn, of course, as soon as they can eat it. When goslings are\r\nfirst allowed to go at large with their mother, every plant of hemlock\r\nwhich grows within their range should be pulled up, as they are very apt\r\nto eat it, and it generally proves fatal. Nightshade is equally\r\npernicious to them; and they have been known to be poisoned by eating\r\nsprigs of yew-tree.\r\n\r\nThe young of _Bremen geese_, when first hatched, are of a very delicate\r\nand tender constitution. It is best to let them remain in the\r\nbreeding-box in which they are hatched for twenty-four hours after they\r\nleave the shell. This should, however, be regulated by the weather;\r\nsince, if it is fair and warm, they may be let out an hour or two in the\r\nmiddle of the day, when they will wet their little bills and nibble at\r\nthe grass. They ought not to be out in the rain at any time during the\r\nfirst month; and both geese and goslings should be shut up in the boxes\r\nat night, during the same period, as a protection against rats and\r\nvermin. A very shallow pool, dug in the yard, with a bucket or two of\r\nwater thrown into it, to suit the temporary purpose of bathing, is\r\nsufficient during that period. If well fed on grain from the time they\r\nare hatched, twenty-five pounds weight can be secured, at seven or eight\r\nmonths old. By feeding them till four days old, and then literally\r\nturning them out to grass, an average weight of from seventeen to\r\neighteen pounds each has been attained, at that age after the feathers\r\nare cleanly picked off.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPONIZING.\r\n\r\nCapons have ever been esteemed among the greatest delicacies of the\r\ntable; and are made by the extirpation of the reproductive organs in\r\nmale fowls. If a cock, when young, is emasculated, a remarkable change\r\ntakes place in him. His natural fierceness is calmed; he becomes placid\r\nand peaceful; his pugnacity has deserted him; he no longer seeks the\r\ncompany of the hens; he loses his previous strong, shrill voice; he\r\ngrows to a far larger size than he would otherwise have done, having\r\nnothing to interfere with the main business of his life--to eat, drink,\r\nsleep, and get fat as speedily as possible; his flesh is peculiarly\r\nwhite, firm and succulent; and even the fat is perfectly destitute of\r\nrankness. The capon may, also, by a little management be converted into\r\nan admirable nurse. Some assert that caponized cocks are never afterward\r\nsubject to the natural process of moulting; but this is denied by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe art has been practised from the earliest antiquity, in Greece,\r\nIndia, and China, for the purpose of improving the flesh of birds for\r\nthe table, in tenderness, juiciness, and flavor. It is extensively\r\nperformed in the great poultry-breeding districts of England; but in\r\nthis country it is by no means so generally practised as would naturally\r\nbe expected.\r\n\r\nThe instruments most approved by skilful operators consist of two five\r\nor seven-pound weights for confining the fowl; a scalpel, for cutting\r\nopen the thin skin enveloping the testicles; a silver retractor, for\r\nstretching open the wound sufficiently wide for operating within; a pair\r\nof spring forceps--with a sharp, cutting edge, resembling that of a\r\nchisel, having a level half an inch in its greatest width--for making\r\nthe incision, and securing the thin membrane; a spoon-shaped instrument,\r\nwith a sharp hook at one end, for pushing and removing the testicles,\r\nadjusting the loop, and assisting in tearing open the tender covering;\r\nand a double silver canula, for containing the two ends of horse-hair,\r\nor fibre, constituting the loop. The expense of these instruments is in\r\nthe neighborhood of six dollars. A cheap penknife may be used instead of\r\nthe scalpel; and the other instruments may be obtained of a cheaper\r\nconstruction--the whole not costing more than half the above-named\r\namount.\r\n\r\nThe cockerel intended for capons should be of the largest breeds, as the\r\nDorking, Cochin China, or the Great Malay. They may be operated upon at\r\nany time after they are a month old; the age of from two to three months\r\nis considered preferable. If possible, it should be done before July; as\r\ncapons made later never prove so fine.\r\n\r\nThe fowl should be confined to a table or board, by laying him with the\r\nleft side downward, the wings drawn behind the rump, the legs extended\r\nbackward, with the upper one farthest drawn out, and the head and neck\r\nleft perfectly free. The feathers are next to be plucked from the right\r\nside, near the hip-joint, on a line with, and between the joint of the\r\nshoulder. The space uncovered may be from an inch to an inch and a half\r\nin diameter, according to the size of the bird. After drawing off the\r\nskin from the part, backward--so that, when left to itself after the\r\noperation is completed, it will cover the wound in the flesh--make an\r\nincision with the bevel-edged knife, at the end of the forceps, between\r\nthe last two ribs, commencing about an inch from the back-bone, and\r\nextending it obliquely downward, from an inch to an inch and a half,\r\ncutting just deep enough to separate the ribs, taking due care not to\r\nwound the intestines.\r\n\r\nNext, adjust and apply the retractor by means of the small thumb-screw,\r\nand stretch the wound sufficiently wide apart to afford room for an\r\nexamination of the organs to be removed. Then, with the scalpel, or a\r\nsharp penknife, carefully cut open the skin, or membrane, covering the\r\nintestines, which, if not sufficiently drawn up, in consequence of the\r\nprevious confinement, may be pushed forward toward the breast-bone, by\r\nmeans of the bowl of the spoon-shaped instrument, or--what would answer\r\nequally well--with the handle of a tea-spoon.\r\n\r\nAs the testicles are exposed to view, they will be found connected with\r\nthe back and sides by a thin membrane, or skin, passing over them. This\r\ncovering must then be seized with the forceps, and torn open with the\r\nsharp-pointed hook at the small end of the spoon-shaped instrument;\r\nafter which the bowl of the spoon must be introduced, with the left\r\nhand, under the lower or left testicle, which is, generally, a little\r\nnearer to the rump than the right one. Then take the double canula,\r\nadjust the hair-loop, and, with the right hand, pass the loop over the\r\nsmall hooked end of the spoon, running it down under the bowl of the\r\nspoon containing the testicle, so as to bring the loop to act upon the\r\nparts which connect the testicle to the back. By drawing the ends of the\r\nhair-loop backward and forward, and at the same time pushing the lower\r\nend of the tube, or canula, toward the rump of the fowl, the cord or\r\nfastening of the testicle is severed.\r\n\r\nA similar process is then to be repeated with the uppermost or right\r\ntesticle; after which, any remains of the testicles, together with the\r\nblood at or around the bottom of the wound, must be scooped out with the\r\nbowl of the spoon. The left testicle is first cut out, in order to\r\nprevent the blood which may issue from covering the one remaining, and\r\nso rendering it more difficult to be seen. The operation, if skilfully\r\ndone, occupies but a few moments; when the skin of the fowl should be\r\ndrawn over the wound with the retractor, and the wound covered with the\r\nfeathers that were plucked off at the commencement.\r\n\r\nIn some fowls, the fore part of the thigh covers the two hindmost ribs;\r\nin which case, care must be taken to draw the fleshy part of the thigh\r\nwell back, to prevent it from being cut; since, otherwise, the operation\r\nmight lame the fowl, or even cause its death.\r\n\r\nFor loops, nothing answers better than the fibre of a cocoa-nut husk,\r\nwhich is rough, and readily separates the testicles by sawing. The next\r\nbest substance is the hair of a horse's mane or tail.\r\n\r\nAfter the operation, the bird may be placed in a warm house, where there\r\nare no perches; since if such appliances are present, the newly-made\r\ncapon will very probably injure himself in his attempts to perch. For\r\nabout a week, the food should be soft, meal porridge, and that in small\r\nquantities, alternated with bread steeped in milk; he may be given as\r\nmuch pure water as he will drink, it being best to use it in a tepid\r\nstate, or at least with the chill taken off. At the end of a week, or\r\nten days, at most, the fowl, if previously of a sound, vigorous\r\nconstitution, will be all right, and may be turned out with the others.\r\n\r\nThe usual method, in France, of making _poulardes_, or hen-capons, as\r\nthey are sometimes improperly designated, is to extirpate the\r\negg-cluster, or _ovarium_, in the same manner as the testicles are\r\nextracted from the cockerel; but it is quite sufficient merely to cut\r\nacross the oviduct, or egg-tube, with a sharp knife. Otherwise, they may\r\nbe treated in the same manner as the capons. Capons are fattened in\r\nprecisely the same manner as other fowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATTENING AND SLAUGHTERING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BAD STYLE OF SLAUGHTERING.]\r\n\r\nFat is not a necessary part of any animal body, being the form which\r\nsuperabundant nourishment assumes, which would, if needed, be converted\r\ninto muscles and other solids. It is contained in certain membranous\r\nreceptacles provided for it, distributed over the body, and it is turned\r\nto use whenever the supply of nourishment is defective, which should be\r\nprovided by the stomach, and other great organs. In such emergencies it\r\nis taken up, in the animal economy, by the absorbents; if the latter,\r\nfrom any cause, act feebly, the health suffers. When, however,\r\nnourishment is taken into the system in greater quantities than is\r\nnecessary for ordinary purposes, the absorbent vessels take it up; and\r\nthe fat thus made is generally healthy, provided there is a good\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nA common method of fattening fowl is to give them the run of a\r\nfarm-yard, where they thrive upon the offal of the stable and other\r\nrefuse, with perhaps some small regular daily feeds; but at\r\nthreshing-time, they become fat, and are styled _barn-door fowls_,\r\nprobably the most delicate and high-flavored of all, both from their\r\nfull allowance of the finest grain, and the constant health in which\r\nthey are kept, by living in the natural state, and having the full\r\nenjoyment of air and exercise; or, they are confined in coops during a\r\ncertain number of weeks, those fowls which are soonest ready being taken\r\nas wanted.\r\n\r\nFowls may also be fattened to the highest pitch, and yet preserved in a\r\nhealthy state--their flesh being equal in quality to that of the\r\nbarn-door fowl--when confined in feeding-houses. These should be at once\r\nwarm and airy, with earth floors, well-raised, and sufficiently\r\ncapacious to accommodate well the number desired. The floor may be\r\nslightly littered down, the litter being often changed; and the greatest\r\ncleanliness should be observed. Sandy gravel should be placed in several\r\ndifferent layers, and often changed. A sufficient number of troughs, for\r\nboth water and food, should be placed around, that the fowls may feed\r\nwith as little interruption as possible from each other; and perches in\r\nthe same proportion should be furnished for those which are inclined to\r\navail themselves of them; though the number will be few, after they have\r\nbegun to fatten. This arrangement, however, assists in keeping them\r\nquiet and contented until that period. Insects and animal food forming a\r\npart of the natural diet of poultry, they are medicinal to them in a\r\nweakly state, and the want of such food may sometimes impede their\r\nthriving.\r\n\r\nThe least nutritious articles of food, so far as it can be done\r\nconveniently, should be fed out first; afterward, those that are more\r\nnutritive. Fattening fowls should be kept quiet, and suffered to take no\r\nmore exercise than is necessary for their health; since more exercise\r\nthan this calls for an expenditure of food which does not avail any\r\nthing in the process of fattening. They should be fed regularly with\r\nsuitable food, and that properly prepared; and as much should be given\r\nthem as they are able to convert into flesh and fat, without waste. The\r\nlarger the quantity of food which a fattening animal can be made to\r\nconsume daily, with a good appetite, or which it can digest thoroughly,\r\nthe greater will be the amount of flesh and fat gained, in proportion to\r\nthe whole quantity of food consumed.\r\n\r\nSubstances in which the nutriment is much concentrated should be fed\r\nwith care. There is danger, especially when the bird is first put to\r\nfeed, that more may be eaten at once than the digestive organs can\r\nmanage. Meal of Indian corn is highly nutritive; and, when properly fed,\r\ncauses fowls to fatten faster than almost any other food. They will not,\r\nhowever, bear to be kept exclusively on this article for a great length\r\nof time. Meal made from the heaviest varieties of corn, especially that\r\nmade from the hard, flinty kinds grown in the Northern and Eastern\r\nStates, is quite too strong for fowls to be full-fed upon. Attention\r\nshould also be paid to the bulk of the food given; since sufficient bulk\r\nis necessary to effect a proper distending of the stomach, as a\r\nnecessary condition of healthy digestion.\r\n\r\nOne simple mode of fattening, which is adopted by many, is the\r\nfollowing: Shut the fowls up where they can get no gravel; keep corn by\r\nthem all the time, and also give them dough enough once a day; for\r\ndrink, give them skimmed milk; with this feed, they will fatten in ten\r\ndays; if kept longer, they should have some gravel, or they will fall\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOats ground into meal, and mixed with a little molasses and water,\r\nbarley-meal with sweet milk, and boiled oats, mixed with meat, are all\r\nexcellent for fattening poultry--reference being had to time, expense,\r\nand quality of flesh.\r\n\r\nIn _fattening ducks_, it must be remembered that their flesh will be\r\nfound to partake, to a great extent, of the flavor of the food on which\r\nthey have been fattened; and as they are naturally quite indiscriminate\r\nfeeders, care should be taken, for at least a week or so before killing,\r\nto confine them to select food. Boiled potatoes are very good feeding,\r\nand are still better if a little grain is mixed with them; Indian meal\r\nis both economical and nutritive, but should be used sparingly at first.\r\nSome recommend butcher's offal; but, although ducks may be fattened on\r\nsuch food to an unusual weight, and thus be profitable for the market,\r\ntheir flesh will be rendered rank and gross, and not at all fit for the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nTo _fatten geese_, it is necessary to give them a little corn daily,\r\nwith the addition of some raw Swedish turnips, carrots, mangel-wurtzel\r\nleaves, lucerne, tares, cabbage leaves, and lettuces. Barley-meal and\r\nwater is recommended by some; but full-grown geese that have never been\r\nhabituated to the mixture when young, will occasionally refuse to eat\r\nit. Cooked potatoes, in small quantities, do no harm; and, apart from\r\nthe consideration of expense, steeped wheat would produce a first-rate\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nThose who can only afford to bring up one or two, should confine them in\r\na crib or some such place, about the beginning of July, and feed them as\r\ndirected, giving them a daily supply of clean water for drink. If from a\r\ndozen to twenty are kept, a large pen of from fifteen to twenty feet\r\nsquare should be made, well covered with straw on the bottom, and a\r\ncovered house in a corner for protection against the sun and rain, when\r\nrequired; since exposure to either of these is not good. It will be\r\nobserved that, about noon, if geese are at liberty, they will seek some\r\nshady spot, to avoid the influence of the sun; and when confined in\r\nsmall places, they have not sufficient space for flapping their wings,\r\nand drying themselves after being wet, nor have they room for moving\r\nabout so as to keep themselves warm. There should be three troughs in\r\nthe crib: one for dry oats; another for vegetables, which ought always\r\nto be cut down; and a third for clean water, of which they must always\r\nhave a plentiful supply. The riper the cabbages and lettuces are with\r\nwhich they are supplied the better.\r\n\r\nSLAUGHTERING AND DRESSING. Both ducks and geese should be led out to the\r\npond a few hours before being slaughtered, where they will neatly purify\r\nand arrange their feathers. The common mode of slaughtering the\r\nlatter--bleeding them from the internal parts of the throat--is\r\nneedlessly slow and cruel.\r\n\r\nFowls for cooking, that are to be sent to a distance, or to be kept any\r\ntime before being served, should be plucked, drawn, and dressed\r\nimmediately after being killed. The feathers strip off much more easily\r\nand cleanly while the bird is yet warm. When large numbers are to be\r\nslaughtered and prepared in a short time, the process is expedited by\r\nscalding the bird in boiling water, when the feathers drop off almost at\r\nonce. Fowls thus treated are, however, generally thought inferior in\r\nflavor, and are more likely to acquire a taint in close, warm weather,\r\nthan such as are plucked and dressed dry.\r\n\r\nIn dressing, all bruises or rupturing of the skin should be avoided. A\r\ncoarse, half-worn cloth, that is pervious to the air, like a wire sieve,\r\nand perfectly dry and clean, forms the best wrapper. The color of\r\nyellow-skinned turkeys--equally well-flavored, by the way--is improved\r\nfor appearance at market by wrapping them for twelve or twenty-four\r\nhours in cloths soaked in cold salt and water, frequently changed. For\r\nthe same purpose, the loose fat is first laid in warm salt and water,\r\nand afterward in milk and water for two or three hours. Some dust with\r\nflour, inside and out, any fowls that are to be carried far or to hang\r\nmany days before being cooked.\r\n\r\nThe oldest and toughest fowls, which are often pronounced unfit for\r\neating, thrown away, and wasted, may be made into a savory and\r\nnutritious dish by jointing, after the bird is plucked and drawn, as for\r\na pie; it should not be skinned. Stew it five hours in a close saucepan,\r\nwith salt, mace, onions, or any other flavoring ingredients desired.\r\nWhen tender, turn it out into a deep dish, so that the meat may be\r\nentirely covered with the liquor. Let it stand thus in its own jelly\r\nfor a day or two; it may then be served in the shape of a curry, a\r\nhash, or a pie, and will be found to furnish an agreeable repast.\r\n\r\nOld geese, killed in the autumn, after they have recovered from\r\nmoulting, and before they have begun to think about the breeding time,\r\nmake excellent meat, if cut into small portions, stewed slowly five or\r\nsix hours with savory condiments, and made into pie the next day. By\r\nroasting and broiling, the large quantity of nutriment contained in the\r\nbones and cartilages is lost, and what might easily be made tender has\r\nto be swallowed tough. Young geese, as well as the old, are, also, often\r\nsalted and boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTRY-HOUSES.\r\n\r\nThe three grand requisites in a poultry house are _cleanliness_,\r\n_dryness_, and _warmth_. A simple arrangement for this purpose is a shed\r\nbuilt against the gable of the house, opposite to the part warmed by the\r\nkitchen fire, in which are placed cross-bars for roosting, with boxes\r\nfor laying in, or quantities of fresh straw. This should always have an\r\nopening, to allow the poultry-house to be cleansed out, at least once a\r\nweek. Fowls will never thrive long amidst uncleanliness; and even with\r\nthe utmost care a place where they have been long kept becomes tainted,\r\nas it is called; the surface of the ground becomes saturated with their\r\n_exuriae_, and is therefore no longer conducive to health.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this effect, some persons in the country frequently change the\r\nsites of their poultry-houses, to obtain fresh ground; while others, who\r\ncannot thus change, purify the houses by fumigations of blazing pitch,\r\nby washing with hot lime water, and by strewing large quantities of\r\npure sand both within and without. Washing the floor every week is a\r\nnecessity; for which purpose it is advantageous to have the house paved\r\neither with stones, bricks, or tiles. A good flooring, however, and\r\ncheaper than either of these, may be formed by using a composition of\r\nlime and smithy ashes, together with the riddlings of common kitchen\r\nashes; these, having been all finely broken, must be mixed together with\r\nwater, put on the floor with a mason's trowel, and nicely smoothed on\r\nthe surface. If this is put on a floor which is in a tolerably dry\r\nsituation, and allowed to harden before being used, it will become\r\nnearly as solid and compact as stone, and is almost as durable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSTIC POULTRY-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe inside of the laying-boxes should be frequently washed with hot lime\r\nwater, to free them from vermin, which greatly torment the sitting hens.\r\nFor the same purpose, poultry should always have a heap of dry sand, or\r\nfine ashes, laid under some covered place or thick tree near their yard,\r\nin which they may dust themselves; this being their means of ridding\r\nthemselves of the vermin with which they are annoyed.\r\n\r\nIn every establishment for poultry-rearing, there ought to be some\r\nseparate crib or cribs, into which to remove fowl when laboring under\r\ndisease; for, not only are many of the diseases to which poultry are\r\nliable highly contagious, but the sick birds are also regarded with\r\ndislike by such as are in health; and the latter will, generally, attack\r\nand maltreat them, aggravating, at least, their sufferings, if not\r\nactually depriving them of life. The moment, therefore, that a bird is\r\nperceived to droop, or appears pining, it should be removed to one of\r\nthese infirmaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FANCY COOP IN CHINESE OR GOTHIC STYLE.]\r\n\r\nSeparate pens are also necessary, to avoid quarrelling among some of the\r\nhighly-blooded birds, more particularly the game fowl. They are also\r\nnecessary when different varieties are kept, in order to avoid improper\r\nor undesirable commixture from accidental crossing. These lodgings may\r\nbe most readily constructed in rows, parallel to each other; the\r\npartitions may be formed of lattice-work, being thus rather ornamental,\r\nand the cost of erection but trifling. Each of these lodgings should be\r\ndivided into two compartments, one somewhat larger than the other; one\r\nto be close and warm, for the sleeping-room; and the other, a large one,\r\nairy and open, that the birds may enjoy themselves in the daytime. Both\r\nmust be kept particularly dry and clean, and be well protected from the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nA _hen-ladder_ is an indispensable piece of furniture, though frequently\r\nabsent. This is a sort of ascending scale of perches, one a little\r\nhigher than the other; not exactly above its predecessor, but somewhat\r\nin advance. By neglecting the use of this very simple contrivance, many\r\nvaluable fowls may be lost or severely injured, by attempting to fly\r\ndown from their roost--an attempt from succeeding in which the birds are\r\nincapacitated, in consequence of the bulk of their body preponderating\r\nover the power of their wings.\r\n\r\nSome people allow their fowl to roost abroad all night, in all weathers,\r\nin trees, or upon fences near the poultry-house. This is a slovenly mode\r\nof keeping even the humblest live stock; it offers a temptation to\r\nthieves, and the health of the fowls cannot be improved by their being\r\nsoaked all night long in drenching rain, or having their feet frozen to\r\nthe branches or rails. There is no difficulty in accustoming any sort of\r\npoultry, except the pea fowl, to regular housing at night.\r\n\r\nIt is better that turkeys should not roost in the same house with the\r\ndomestic fowl, as they are apt to be cross to sitting and laying hens.\r\n\r\nNo poultry-house is what it ought to be, it may be suggested, in\r\nconclusion, unless it is in such a state as to afford a lady, without\r\noffending her sense of decent propriety, a respectable shelter on a\r\nshowery day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDISEASES AND THEIR REMEDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our climate, the disorders to which poultry are liable are,\r\ncomparatively, few in number, and they usually yield to judicious\r\ntreatment. The little attention that has too generally been bestowed\r\nupon this subject may be accounted for from the circumstance that, in an\r\neconomical point of view, the value of an individual fowl is relatively\r\ninsignificant; and while the ailments of other domesticated animals\r\ngenerally claim a prompt and efficient care, the unhappy inhabitants of\r\nthe poultry-yard are too often relieved of their sufferings in the most\r\nsummary manner. There are reasons, however, which will justify a more\r\ncareful regard in this matter, besides the humanity of adding to the\r\ncomfort of these useful creatures; and the attempt to cure, in cases of\r\ndisease, will often be rewarded by their flesh being rendered more\r\npalatable, and their eggs more wholesome.\r\n\r\nMost of the diseases to which fowls are subject are the result of errors\r\nin diet or management, and should have been prevented, or may be removed\r\nby a change, and the adoption of a suitable regimen. When an individual\r\nis attacked, it should be forthwith removed, to prevent the\r\ncontamination of the rest of the flock. Nature, who proves a guardian to\r\nfowls in health, will nurse them in their weakness, and act as a most\r\nefficient physician to the sick; and the aim of all medical treatment\r\nshould be to follow the indications which Nature holds out, and assist\r\nin the effort which she constantly makes for the restoration of health.\r\n\r\nThe more common diseases which afflict poultry will be so described that\r\nthey need not be misapprehended, and such remedies suggested as\r\nexperience has proved to be salutary; and, taken alphabetically, the\r\nfirst on the list is\r\n\r\n\r\nASTHMA.\r\n\r\nThis common disease seems to differ sufficiently in its characteristics\r\nto warrant a distinction into two species. In one it appears to be\r\ncaused by an obstruction of the air-cells, by an accumulation of phlegm,\r\nwhich interferes with the exercise of their functions. The fowl labors\r\nfor breath, in consequence of not being able to take in the usual\r\nquantity of air at an inspiration. The capacity of the lungs is thereby\r\ndiminished, the lining membrane of the windpipe becomes thickened, and\r\nits minute branches are more or less affected. These effects may,\r\nperhaps, be attributed to the fact that, as our poultry are originally\r\nnatives of tropical climates, they require a more equal temperature than\r\nis afforded, except by artificial means, however well they may appear\r\nacclimated.\r\n\r\nAnother variety of asthma is induced by fright, or undue excitement. It\r\nis sometimes produced by chasing fowls to catch them, by seizing them\r\nsuddenly, or by their fighting with each other. In these cases, a\r\nblood-vessel is often ruptured, and sometimes one or more of the\r\nair-cells. The symptoms are, short breathing; opening of the beak often,\r\nand for quite a time; heaving and panting of the chest; and, in case of\r\na rupture of a blood-vessel, a drop of blood appearing on the beak.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Confirmed asthma is difficult to cure. For the disease in\r\nits incipient state, the fowl should be kept warm, and treated with\r\nrepeated doses of hippo-powder and sulphur, mixed with butter, with the\r\naddition of a small quantity of Cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSTIVENESS.\r\n\r\nThe existence of this disorder will become apparent by observing the\r\nunsuccessful attempts of the fowl to relieve itself. It frequently\r\nresults from continued feeding on dry diet, without access to green\r\nvegetables. Indeed, without the use of these, or some substitute--such\r\nas mashed potatoes--costiveness is certain to ensue. The want of a\r\nsufficient supply of good water will also occasion the disease, on\r\naccount of that peculiar structure of the fowl, which renders them\r\nunable to void their urine, except in connection with the _faeces_ of\r\nsolid food, and through the same channel.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Soaked bread, with warm skimmed-milk, is a mild remedial\r\nagent, and will usually suffice. Boiled carrots or cabbage are more\r\nefficient. A meal of earth-worms is sometimes advisable; and hot\r\npotatoes, mixed with bacon-fat, are said to be excellent. Castor-oil and\r\nburned butter will remove the most obstinate cases; though a clyster of\r\noil, in addition, may sometimes be required, in order to effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRH[OE]A.\r\n\r\nThere are times when fowls dung more loosely than at others, especially\r\nwhen they have been fed on green or soft food; but this, may occur\r\nwithout the presence of disease. Should this state, however, deteriorate\r\ninto a confirmed and continued laxity, immediate attention is required\r\nto guard against fatal effects. The causes of diarrh[oe]a are dampness,\r\nundue acidity in the bowels, or the presence of irritating matter there.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ are lassitude and emaciation; and, in very severe cases,\r\nthe voiding of calcareous matter, white, streaked with yellow. This\r\nresembles the yolk of a stale egg, and clings to the feathers near the\r\nvent. It becomes acrid, from the presence of ammonia, and causes\r\ninflammation, which speedily extends throughout the intestines.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ This, of course, depends upon the cause. If the disease is\r\nbrought on by a diet of green or soft food, the food must be changed,\r\nand water sparingly given; if it arises from undue acidity, chalk mixed\r\nwith meal is advantageous, but rice-flour boluses are most reliable.\r\nAlum-water, of moderate strength, is also beneficial. In cases of\r\n_bloody flux_, boiled rice and milk, given warm, with a little magnesia,\r\nor chalk, may be successfully used.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEVER.\r\n\r\nThe most decided species of fever to which fowls are subject occurs at\r\nthe period of hatching, when the animal heat is often so increased as to\r\nbe perceptible to the touch. A state of fever may also be observed when\r\nthey are about to lay. This is, generally, of small consequence, when\r\nthe birds are otherwise healthy; but it is of moment, if any other\r\ndisorder is present, since, in such case, the original malady will be\r\naggravated. Fighting also frequently occasions fever, which sometimes\r\nproves fatal.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ are an increased circulation of the blood; excessive\r\nheat; and restlessness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Light food and change of air; and, if necessary, aperient\r\nmedicine, such as castor oil, with a little burned butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION.\r\n\r\nCases of indigestion among fowls are common, and deserve attention\r\naccording to the causes from which they proceed. A change of food will\r\noften produce _crop-sickness_, as it is called, when the fowl takes but\r\nlittle food, and suddenly loses flesh. Such disease is of little\r\nconsequence, and shortly disappears. When it requires attention at all,\r\nall the symptoms will be removed by giving their diet in a warm state.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, a fit of indigestion threatens severe consequences,\r\nespecially if long continued. Every effort should be made to ascertain\r\nthe cause, and the remedy must be governed by the circumstances of the\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ are heaviness, moping, keeping away from the nest, and\r\nwant of appetite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRAIRIE HENS.]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Lessen the quantity of food, and oblige the fowl to\r\nexercise in an open walk. Give some powdered cayenne and gentian, mixed\r\nwith the usual food. Iron-rust, mixed with soft food, or diffused in\r\nwater, is an excellent tonic, and is indicated when there is atrophy, or\r\ndiminution of the flesh. It may be combined with oats or grain.\r\nMilk-warm ale has also a good effect, when added to the diet of diseased\r\nfowls.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICE.\r\n\r\nThe whole feathered tribe seem to be peculiarly liable to be infested\r\nwith lice; and there have been instances when fowls have been so covered\r\nin this loathsome manner that the natural color of the feathers has been\r\nundistinguishable. The presence of vermin is not only annoying to\r\npoultry, but materially interferes with their growth, and prevents their\r\nfattening. They are, indeed, the greatest drawback to the success and\r\npleasure of the poultry fanciers; and nothing but unremitting vigilance\r\nwill exterminate them, and keep them exterminated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ To attain this, whitewash frequently all the parts\r\nadjacent to the roosting-pole, take the poles down and run them slowly\r\nthrough a fire made of wood shavings, dry weeds, or other light\r\nwaste combustibles. Flour of sulphur, placed in a vessel, and set on\r\nfire in a close poultry-house, will penetrate every crevice, and\r\neffectually exterminate the vermin. When a hen comes off with her\r\nbrood, the old nest should be cleaned out, and a new one placed; and\r\ndry tobacco-leaves, rubbed to a powder between the hands, and mixed\r\nwith the hay of the nest, will add much to the health of the poultry.\r\n\r\nFlour of sulphur may also be mixed with Indian-meal and water, and fed\r\nin the proportion of one pound of sulphur to two dozen fowls, in two\r\nparcels, two days apart. Almost any kind of grease, or unctuous matter,\r\nis also certain death to the vermin of domestic poultry. In the case of\r\nvery young chickens, it should only be used in a warm, sunny day, When\r\nthey should be put into a coop with their mother, the coop darkened for\r\nan hour or two, and every thing made quiet, that they may secure a good\r\nrest and nap after the fatigue occasioned by greasing them. They should\r\nbe handled with great care, and greased thoroughly; the hen, also. After\r\nresting, they may be permitted to come out and bask in the sun; and in a\r\nfew days they will look sprightly enough.\r\n\r\nTo guard against vermin, however, it should not be forgotten that\r\n_cleanliness_ is of vital importance; and there must always be plenty of\r\nslacked lime, dry ashes, and sand, easy of access to the fowls, in which\r\nthey can roll and dust themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF FEATHERS.\r\n\r\nThis disease, common to confined fowls, should not be confounded with\r\nthe natural process of moulting. In this diseased state, no new feathers\r\ncome to replace the old, but the fowl is left bald and naked; a sort of\r\nroughness also appears on the skin; there is a falling off in appetite,\r\nas well as moping and inactivity.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ As this affection is, in all probability, constitutional\r\nrather than local, external remedies may not always prove sufficient.\r\nStimulants, however, applied externally, will serve to assist the\r\noperation of whatever medicine may be given. Sulphur may be thus\r\napplied, mixed with lard. Sulphur and cayenne, in the proportion of one\r\nquarter each, mixed with fresh butter, is good to be given internally,\r\nand will act as a powerful alterative. The diet should be changed; and\r\ncleanliness and fresh air are indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn _diseased moulting_, where the feathers stare and fall off, till the\r\nnaked skin appears, sugar should be added to the water which the fowls\r\ndrink, and corn and hemp-seed be given. They should be kept warm, and\r\noccasionally be treated to doses of cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIP.\r\n\r\nThis disorder, known also as the _gapes_, is the most common ailment of\r\npoultry and all domestic birds. It is especially the disease of young\r\nfowls, and is most prevalent in the hottest months, being not only\r\ntroublesome but frequently fatal.\r\n\r\nAs to its _cause_ and nature, there has been some diversity of opinion.\r\nSome consider it a catarrhal inflammation, which produces a thickening\r\nof the membrane lining the nostrils and mouth, and particularly the\r\ntongue; others assert that it is caused by want of water, or by bad\r\nwater; while others describe it as commencing in the form of a vesicle\r\non the tip of the tongue, which occasions a thickened state of the skin,\r\nby the absorption of its contents. The better opinion, however, is, that\r\nthe disease is occasioned by the presence of worms, or _fasciolae_, in\r\nthe windpipe. On the dissection of chickens dying with this disorder,\r\nthe windpipe will be found to contain numerous small, red worms, about\r\nthe size of a cambric needle, which, at the first glance, might be\r\nmistaken for blood-vessels. It is supposed by some that these worms\r\ncontinue to grow, until, by their enlargement, the windpipe is so filled\r\nup that the chicken is suffocated.\r\n\r\nThe common _symptoms_ of this malady are the thickened state of the\r\nmembrane of the tongue, particularly toward the tip; the breathing is\r\nimpeded, and the beak is frequently held open, as if the creature were\r\ngasping for breath; the beak becomes yellow at its base; and the\r\nfeathers on the head appear ruffled and disordered; the tongue is very\r\ndry; the appetite is not always impaired; but yet the fowl cannot eat,\r\nprobably on account of the difficulty which the act involves, and sits\r\nin a corner, pining in solitude.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ Most recommend the immediate removal of the thickened\r\nmembrane, which can be effected by anointing the part with butter or\r\nfresh cream. If necessary, the scab may be pricked with a needle. It\r\nwill also be found beneficial to use a pill, composed of equal parts of\r\nscraped garlic and horse-radish, with as much cayenne pepper as will\r\noutweigh a grain of wheat; to be mixed with fresh butter, and given\r\nevery morning; the fowl to be kept warm.\r\n\r\nIf the disease is in an advanced state, shown by the chicken's holding\r\nup its head and gaping for want of breath, the fowl should be thrown on\r\nits back, and while the neck is held straight, the bill should be\r\nopened, and a quill inserted into the windpipe, with a little\r\nturpentine. This being round, will loosen and destroy a number of small,\r\nred worms, some of which will be drawn up by the feather, and others\r\nwill be coughed up by the chicken. The operation should be repeated the\r\nfollowing day, if the gaping continues. If it ceases, the cure is\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nIt is stated, also, that the disease has been entirely prevented by\r\nmixing a small quantity of spirits of turpentine with the food of fowls;\r\nfrom five to ten drops, to a pint of meal, to be made into a dough.\r\nAnother specific recommended is to keep iron standing in vinegar, and\r\nput a little of the liquid in the food every few days.\r\n\r\nSome assert that it is promoted by simply scanting fowls in their food;\r\nand this upon the ground that chickens which are not confined with the\r\nhen, but both suffered to run at large and collect their own food, are\r\nnot troubled with this disease. There can be little doubt that it is\r\ncaused by inattention to cleanliness in the habits and lodgings of\r\nfowls; and some, therefore, think that if the chicken-houses and coops\r\nare kept clean, and frequently washed with thin whitewash, having plenty\r\nof salt and brine mixed with it, that it would be eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nROUP.\r\n\r\nThis disease is caused mainly by cold and moisture; but it is often\r\nascribed to improper feeding and want of cleanliness and exercise. It\r\naffects fowls of all ages, and is either acute or chronic; sometimes\r\ncommencing suddenly, on exposure; at others gradually, as the\r\nconsequence of neglected colds, or damp weather or lodging. Chronic roup\r\nhas been known to extend through two years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWANS.]\r\n\r\nThe most prominent _symptoms_ are difficult and noisy breathing and\r\ngaping, terminating in a rattling in the throat; the head swells, and is\r\nfeverish; the eyes are swollen, and the eye-lidsappear livid; the sight\r\ndecays, and sometimes total blindness ensues; there are discharges from\r\nthe nostrils and mouth, at first thin and limpid, afterward thick,\r\npurulent, and fetid. In this stage, which resembles the glanders in\r\nhorses, the disease becomes infectious.\r\n\r\nAs _secondary_ symptoms, it may be noticed that the appetite fails,\r\nexcept for drink; the crop feels hard; the feathers are staring,\r\nruffled, and without the gloss that appears in health; the fowl mopes by\r\nitself and seems to suffer much pain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._ The fowls should be kept warm, and have plenty of water and\r\nscalded bran, or other light food. When chronic, change of food and air\r\nis advisable. The ordinary remedies--such as salt dissolved in\r\nwater--are inefficacious. A solution of sulphate of zinc, as an\r\neye-water, is a valuable cleansing application. Rue-pills, and a\r\ndecoction of rue, as a tonic, have been administered with apparent\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nThe following is recommended: of powdered gentian and Jamaica ginger,\r\neach one part; Epsom salts, one and a half parts; and flour of sulphur,\r\none part; to be made up with butter, and given every morning.\r\n\r\nThe following method of treatment is practised by some of the most\r\nsuccessful poulterers in the country. As soon as discovered, if in warm\r\nweather, remove the infected fowls to some well-ventilated apartment, or\r\nyard; if in winter, to some warm place; then give a dessert-spoonful of\r\ncastor-oil; wash their heads with warm Castile-soap suds, and let them\r\nremain till next morning fasting. Scald for them Indian-meal, adding two\r\nand a half ounces of Epsom salts for ten hens, or in proportion for a\r\nless or larger number; give it warm, and repeat the dose in a day or\r\ntwo, if they do not recover.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, however, the best mode of dealing with roup and all putrid\r\naffections is as follows: Take of finely pulverized, fresh-burnt\r\ncharcoal, and of new yeast, each three parts; of pulverized sulphur, two\r\nparts; of flour, one part; of water, a sufficient quantity; mix well,\r\nand make into two doses, of the size of a hazel-nut, and give one three\r\ntimes a day. _Cleanliness_ is no less necessary than warmth; and it will\r\nsometimes be desirable to bathe the eyes and nostrils with warm milk and\r\nwater, or suds, as convenient.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS AND SORES.\r\n\r\nFowls are exposed to wounds from many sources. In their frequent\r\nencounters with each other, they often result; the poultry-house is\r\nbesieged by enemies at night, and, in spite of all precaution, rats,\r\nweasels, and other animals will assault the occupants of the roost, or\r\nnest, to their damage. These wounds, if neglected, often degenerate into\r\npainful and dangerous ulcers.\r\n\r\nWhen such injuries occur, _cleanliness_ is the first step toward a cure.\r\nThe wound should be cleared from all foreign matter, washed with tepid\r\nmilk and water, and excluded as far as possible from the air. The fowl\r\nshould be removed from its companions, which, in such cases, seldom or\r\nnever show any sympathy, but, on the contrary, are always ready to\r\nassault the invalid, and aggravate the injury. Should the wound not\r\nreadily heal, but ulcerate, it may be bathed with alum-water. The\r\nointment of creosote is said to be effectual, even when the ulcer\r\nexhibits a fungous character, or _proud flesh_ is present. Ulcers may\r\nalso be kept clean, if dressed with a little lard, or washed with a weak\r\nsolution of sugar of lead; if they are indolent, they may be touched\r\nwith blue-stone.\r\n\r\nWhen severe _fractures_ occur to the limbs of fowls, the best course,\r\nundoubtedly, to pursue--unless they are very valuable--is to kill them\r\nat once, as an act of humanity. When, however, it is deemed worth while\r\nto preserve them, splints may be used, when practicable. Great\r\ncleanliness must be observed; the diet should be reduced; and every\r\nprecaution taken against the inflammation, which is sure to supervene.\r\nWhen it is established, cooling lotions--such as warm milk and\r\nwater--may be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF NEW PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMAILING NOTICE.--Single copies of any of these Books will be sent to any\r\naddress, post-paid, on receipt of price.
