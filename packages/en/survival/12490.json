The\r\ndefenses of Cadiz and Ceuta have been greatly strengthened in this\r\nrespect. The most recent additions are some very powerful Krupp guns for\r\nthe fortress of Isabel II., at Mahon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW KRUPP BREECH LOADING GUNS FOR SPANISH FORTIFICATIONS.]\r\n\r\nWe give engravings from photographs, as presented in _La Illustracion\r\nEspañola_. These guns are breech loaders, of steel, 30½ centimeters\r\ncaliber, or 12 inches, 49 tons weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW KRUPP BREECH LOADING GUNS FOR SPANISH FORTIFICATIONS.]\r\n\r\nOne of our engravings shows the great revolving crane by which the guns\r\nwere lifted and placed on the truck for conveyance over a track to their\r\nintended position. This crane is worked by eight men, and readily lifts\r\nburdens of about 200,000 lb. The other engraving shows the jack frame and\r\njacks employed to remove the gun from the temporary truck.

TETMAJER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis memoir is the first of a series upon the unification of nomenclature\r\nand classification of building materials, undertaken by the author at the\r\nrequest of the Swiss Engineers' and Architects' Union. For its\r\npreparation numerous mechanical tests have been made upon steel rails,\r\nboth good and bad, taken from the Swiss railways, while the corresponding\r\nchemical analyses have been made by Dr. Treadwell in the Polytechnic\r\nLaboratory, at Zurich. The results are given for twenty-two examples,\r\nabout one-half of which have stood well, while the remainder have either\r\nbroken, split, or suffered considerable abrasion in wear; but in many\r\ninstances the mechanical test of tensile strength, elongation, and\r\ncontraction, and the figures of quality (Wohler's sum and Tetmajer's\r\ncoefficient) deduced from these have varied very considerably for the\r\nresults obtained in practice.\r\n\r\nThe best wearing rails, which often give contradictory results with the\r\ntensile test, were comparatively pure manganese steels, low in silicon,\r\nonly exceptionally up to 0.2 per cent., but generally below 0.1 per\r\ncent., and with less than 0.1 per cent. of phosphorus and sulphur. On the\r\nother hand, rails with a tendency to break or split are low in carbon,\r\nwith variable proportions of manganese, but contain much silicon, 0.3 to\r\n0.9 per cent., and often above 0.1 per cent. of phosphorus. Another\r\nseries of experiments upon rails for the Finland lines made by the author\r\nin 1879-80 shows the high quality of manganese steel. These are\r\nessentially highly carburized (0.3-0.4 per cent. carbon) with 0.7 to 1.4\r\nper cent. manganese, and have stood three and a half years' wear without\r\na single one being broken; while those of silicon steel with 0.106-0.144\r\nper cent. carbon, 0.592-0.828 manganese, and 0.423-0.435 silicon have\r\nfailed in many cases, showing a great tendency to split. In both of the\r\nlatter instances, however, the figures deduced from tensile tests of both\r\ngood and bad specimens were substantially the same.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the difference between the two kinds of steel the author\r\nattributes to differences in the structure of the ingot due to the agent\r\nused in \"chemical consolidation,\" which may be either manganese or\r\nsilicon, which structures are illustrated by photographs of ingot\r\nfractures. When silicon is used there is a tendency to unsoundness about\r\nthe exterior of the ingot, which is surrounded by a honeycomb-like\r\ncellular casing of greater or less depth; while with manganese the\r\nvesicular cavities are more or less dispersed through the whole\r\nsubstance, or concentrated toward the interior of the ingot. Rails made\r\nfrom the former are, therefore, more likely to contain unsound portions\r\nnear the outer wearing surface, and to give unsatisfactory results in\r\nwear, than those from the latter; but as the test pieces are usually cut\r\nfrom the center of the railhead, the tensile resistance of the interior\r\nmay be equal to or surpass that of the superior material. In summing up\r\nhis observations the author concludes that the method of tensile testing\r\nis mainly of value in determining the quality of the material, but that\r\nfor the finished product properly arranged falling weight tests are\r\nnecessary. He also considers that the test pieces should be flat bars of\r\n2.5 to 3.5 centimeters in area, cut as near as possible to the outer\r\nsurface of both head and foot of the rail. He reprobates especially the\r\nresearch for microscopic imperfections (mikrobensücherei) upon the\r\nfractured surfaces, as an annoyance to the producer, and perfectly\r\nuseless to the consumer.--_Stahl und Eisen_, vol. iv., page 608; through\r\n_Proc.

TRAPPEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of the Bessemer process when carried out on the small scale\r\nat Avesta in Sweden, as described by Professor Ehrenwerth, and subsequent\r\nexperiments of a similar kind made at Pravali, in Carinthia, and\r\nelsewhere, have led the author, who is specially occupied in the building\r\nof Bessemer works, to design a plant suitable for operation upon small\r\ncharges. This consists essentially of a converter about 1 meter outside\r\ndiameter, and 1.5 meters high, connected by a single trunnion to a\r\nhorizontal steel shaft carried by the arm of a hydraulic crane which is\r\nvery similar in character to the ladle crane of a large sized converter.\r\nThe sweep of the crane is such as to allow the converter to be brought\r\nclose up to the tap hole of the blast furnace or cupola, so that the use\r\nof open gutters for the fluid metal may be avoided as much as possible.\r\nThe converter is turned on its axis by a screw and worm wheel, which is\r\nmanipulated by a workman standing on a platform at the opposite arm of\r\nthe crane. The blast is brought in from above by a pipe down the central\r\npillar of the crane, which is connected with the blast-main by a flexible\r\ntube and packed joint. The outer trunnion bearing is open, so that by\r\nslightly raising and lowering the ram of the crane, the converter may be\r\nleft suspended to a weighing machine in front of the furnace, if it is\r\nrequired to determine the weight of the charge. When the converter is\r\nfilled, it is borne by the crane into a convenient position for blowing,\r\nand if the basic method is followed for removing the slag, the converted\r\nmetal is cast into ingot moulds, which are manipulated by a small ingot\r\ncrane of the ordinary pattern. In the case of small existing\r\nblast-furnaces, which usually have their tap holes near to the ground, it\r\nmay be necessary to have a shallow ingot pit (20 to 24 inches deep); but\r\nwith cupolas this will not generally be necessary, and the whole of the\r\noperations may be carried on at the ground level. Each crane is intended\r\nto be supplied with two or three converters, so that operations may be\r\ncarried on continuously. The weight of charge proposed is 15 cwt., which\r\nshould under ordinary conditions give 12 cwt. of ingots. Taking the time\r\nof a single converting operation at half an hour it will be easy to\r\nobtain fifty blows per day, or a production of 30 tons. This may be\r\neasily increased by placing a second converting crane on the other side\r\nof the furnace, for which the same blowing engine will be sufficient, as\r\nthe actual blowing time will not exceed twelve minutes. The labor\r\nrequired for each converter will be about six men per shift.\r\n\r\nThe blast required has been experimentally determined at 40-50 cubic\r\nmeters per minute at 15 lb. pressure. This will be supplied by a single\r\ncylinder engine of 900 millimeters blast, and 786 millimeters steam\r\npiston, diameter 786 millimeters, stroke making fifty revolutions per\r\nminute, which is also to work a Root blower and the accumulator pumps.\r\nHaving regard to these very different demands upon the power of the\r\nengine, it will be provided with expansion gear, allowing a considerable\r\nvariation in the cut-off. A single boiler of 70 to 75 square meters\r\nheating surface will be sufficient. The accumulator is intended to work\r\nat 300 lb. pressure.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the plant, including one of each of the following items,\r\nconverter, converter truck, blowing engine, accumulator, ingot crane,\r\ncentesimal weighing machine, and accumulator pump, is estimated at £2,050\r\nto £2,100; and that of the steam boiler, £325. The buildings may be of\r\nthe simplest and cheapest possible character. As the productive power of\r\nsuch a plant contrasts very favorably with its cost, the author considers\r\nthat it may be fairly expected to meet the competition of large works,\r\nespecially in the manufacture of a high-class product.--_Stahl und\r\nEisen_, vol. iv., page 524; through _Proc.

SEATON.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy attention was first called to the modern triple compound engine by the\r\npublished reports of the trial trip of the yacht Isa, and in it I plainly\r\ndiscerned the germs of a successful new type of engine; but it was not\r\nuntil I had seen the engines of the screw steamer Aberdeen erected in the\r\nworkshops of Messrs. Robert Napier & Sons that I became convinced that it\r\nwas the engine of the immediate future. It is, however, due to the\r\nfarsightedness and enterprise of Mr. C.H. Wilson, M.P., that I was\r\nenabled to try the merits of the new system and compare it with the old.\r\nMr. Wilson had already viewed the triple compound engine with more than\r\nordinary interest, and it required little persuasion on my part to allow\r\nthe company to which I have the honor to belong to construct a triple\r\nexpansion engine in lieu of the ordinary compound for one of four sister\r\nships which it then had in hand for Messrs. Thomas Wilson, Sons & Co.,\r\nthe latter only stipulating that it was to be of the same power as the\r\nengine already contracted for. As I was quite convinced that economy was\r\ndue to the system rather than to the higher pressure, it was decided not\r\nto increase the boiler pressure more than was necessary to suit the\r\ntriple system. The other three ships already alluded to were being fitted\r\nwith engines having cylinders 25 inches and 50 inches diameter by 45\r\ninches stroke, and supplied with steam of 90 lb. pressure from a double\r\nended boiler 13 feet 9 inches diameter by 15 feet long, having a total\r\nheating surface of 2,310 feet, so that these engines have every\r\nqualification for being economical so far as general proportions go, the\r\nstroke being an abnormally long one and the boiler of ample size.\r\nExperience has since shown that these engines are economical in coal,\r\nand the wear and tear exceptionally small.\r\n\r\nThe new engines for the fourth boat were made with considerably shorter\r\nstroke, and the cylinders proportioned so as to give equal power; they\r\nare 21 inches, 32 inches, and 56 inches diameter by 36 inches stroke, the\r\nhigh pressure cylinder being supported on columns immediately over the\r\nmedium cylinder, and in other respects these engines were made as near as\r\npossible like the other ones above named. Steam at 110 lb. pressure is\r\nsupplied from a double ended boiler 12 feet 9 inches diameter and fifteen\r\nfeet long, having a total heating surface of 2,270 square feet, and\r\nidentical in design with the boiler supplied for the other engines. The\r\npropellers were made exactly alike in all respects, and the ships being\r\nlikewise precisely alike, a comparison of the performances of the one\r\nfitted with the triple engines could be made with as little grounds for\r\ndifferences of opinion as is possible. One of the ships fitted with the\r\nordinary compound engines was named the Kovno, that with the triple\r\ncompound engines the Draco. Their dimensions are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                 Feet. Inches.\r\nLength between perpendiculars.    270    0\r\nBreadth.                           34    0\r\nDepth of hold.                     18    3\r\n\r\nAnd of 1,700 tons gross register. They are ordinary cargo boats, built of\r\nsteel, having a raised quarter deck and long bridge amidships, but\r\nnothing about them otherwise requires comment.\r\n\r\nAfter making a voyage or two to the Baltic, and finding that everything\r\nwas working satisfactorily, the Kovno was loaded with 2,400 tons dead\r\nweight, and sailed in January, 1883, for Buenos Ayres; the Draco was\r\nloaded with 2,425 tons dead weight, and sailed March, 1883, for Bombay,\r\nthe distance in both cases being about 6,400 miles. It was thought\r\nadvisable, for purposes of comparison, that the ships should steam at as\r\nnear as possible the same speed; and to attain this object, we considered\r\nthe safest plan was to instruct the engineers as to the average amount of\r\ncoal they were to burn per day, and experience with these ships on their\r\nBaltic voyages had fixed this at 12 tons in the case of the Kovno and 10\r\ntons in the case of the Draco. During the voyage each ship seems to have\r\nhad fair average weather, and equal care was taken in getting the best\r\nresults possible. The average speed of the Draco was, however, 8.625\r\nknots, or 207 miles per day, the engines making on the average 57.5\r\nrevolutions per minute, while the Kovno did only 8.1 knots, or 194 miles\r\nper day, the engines making 55.5 revolutions. The coal used was ordinary\r\nSouth Yorkshire, just as it comes from the pits for bunker purposes. The\r\nindicated horse power in each case would average about 600. The total\r\ncoal consumed was 326 tons in the Draco and 405 tons in the Kovno, or a\r\nsaving of 19.5 per cent. over the ordinary compounds, with an increase of\r\nspeed of 6.5 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1883, one of the others, the Grodno, sailed from Bombay, and\r\nattained an average speed of 8.5 knots, or 204 miles per day, the engines\r\nmaking 57 revolutions, with a coal consumption of 12.8 tons per day, or\r\n469 tons on the voyage. The Draco's consumption is therefore 30.5 per\r\ncent. less than that of the Grodno on the round voyage, and 20.3 percent\r\nper day.\r\n\r\nThe success of the triple compound engine was in these instances more\r\nthan had been anticipated, and induced Mr. Wilson to go a step further.\r\nThe S.S. Yeddo had been refitted with boilers made for a working pressure\r\nof 90 lb. per square inch, but owing to the size of the shafting the\r\nworking pressure was limited to 70 lb.; the average consumption of coal\r\nunder these circumstances on two voyages was 17 tons per day. These\r\nboilers had a margin of safety beyond what was required by the rules when\r\nmade, and as the Board of Trade rules had been modified in the mean\r\nwhile, it was found that they could with safety be worked at 100 lb. per\r\nsquare inch. A third cylinder was now fitted on the top of the original\r\nlow pressure, and the safety valves loaded to the 100 lb., and the ship\r\nwas dispatched to Cronstadt. After making two voyages under similar\r\ncircumstances to the two previous ones, the average consumption was 13.5\r\ntons per day only. In this case it was the same ship, same boilers, same\r\nengines, same propeller, and same men, the only difference being the\r\naddition of a third cylinder and the increase of pressure.\r\n\r\nSo far all the trials had been made with two crank engines; so it was now\r\ndecided to construct another set of engines for 150 lb. pressure, having\r\na crank to each cylinder. These engines had cylinders 20½ inches, 33\r\ninches, and 58 inches diameter by 36 inches stroke, and were fitted into\r\nthe screw steamer Rosario, whose dimensions are 275 feet 3 inches between\r\nperpendiculars, 34 feet 3 inches beam, and 19 feet 2 inches depth of\r\nhold, 1,862 tons gross, and the deadweight capacity 2,550 tons. In March\r\nlast year she was loaded with 2,530 tons deadweight, and did the voyage\r\nto Bombay at an average speed of 8.6 knots on a consumption of 10.5 tons\r\nper day of South Yorkshire coal, and burnt on the voyage 347 tons. This\r\nresult is superior to that of the Draco when the size of the ship is\r\ntaken into account, but is not so much so as might have been anticipated\r\nfrom the increase of pressure and the rate of expansion, which was 14.4\r\nin the Rosario and 12 in the Draco. Another set of engines was made from\r\nthe patterns of those of the Draco, but with the high pressure cylinder\r\n20 inches diameter, steam at 150 lb. pressure being supplied from two\r\nsingle ended boilers, having a total heating surface of 2,200 square\r\nfeet. They are fitted in the S.S. Finland, a cargo boat 270 feet long, 35\r\nfeet beam, by 18 feet depth of hold, and 1,954 tons gross register. In\r\nJanuary she was loaded with 2,500 tons deadweight, and sailed for\r\nRangoon. The average speed attained was 8.42 knots per hour, or 202 miles\r\nper day, on a consumption of 10.3 tons of Welsh coal per day, the rate of\r\nexpansion being 12. It should be mentioned that all these ships named are\r\nfitted and steered with steam stearing gear, so that in comparing these\r\nresults and those published of the engines made by an eminent engineer in\r\nthe north of England, an allowance should be made, as in that ship there\r\nwas no steam stearing gear.\r\n\r\nI have chosen to make all these comparisons by reference to the ships'\r\nlogs, and to give results such as a shipowner looks for rather than those\r\nwhich engineers prefer to use in forming a judgment on the merits of\r\ndifferent engines. I do this for two reasons: first, because the\r\ncommercial success of the triple compound engine depends on the saving it\r\ncan effect in a long voyage; and secondly, because I had no reliable\r\nindicator diagrams from which the consumption per indicated horse power\r\ncould be calculated with any degree of accuracy. On trial trips with the\r\nsteamers already named, the consumption of ordinary South Yorkshire coal\r\nwas 1.6 lb. per indicated horse power, and the consumption of water per\r\nindicated horse power calculated from the high pressure indicator\r\ndiagrams was 1.41 in the Draco, 13.2 in the Rosario, and 13.16 with the\r\nFinland, or taking the medium pressure diagrams, it was 12.2, 1.30, and\r\n11.95 respectively. Twelve months ago we constructed for Messrs. Thomas\r\nWilson, Sons & Co., two sets of triple expansion engines of 600 indicated\r\nhorse power, one having two cranks and the other three cranks, the\r\nengines, boilers, and propellers being otherwise exactly alike and fitted\r\ninto sister ships. The water consumed in the three crank engine is 12.93\r\nlb., against 13.0 in the two crank, but the former drives its ship nearly\r\n½ knot per hour faster than the latter does its, and when both ships are\r\ndriven at the same speed the consumption of coal in the three crank ship\r\nis considerably less than in the other.\r\n\r\nWe have now entirely given up the construction of two-crank triple\r\nexpansion engines, because of the impossibility of equally dividing the\r\nwork between the cranks; for, although the engine when running appeared\r\nto be perfectly balanced, the wear of the brasses of the crank having the\r\ntwo cylinders was always considerably more than that of the other.\r\nPlacing the high pressure cylinder over the low pressure cylinder seemed\r\nto give the most satisfactory results, but even these were far inferior\r\nto those once obtained with the three cranks. We have lately constructed\r\nsome very small three-crank engines from which exceedingly good results\r\nwere obtained; the cylinders are only 11½ inches, 17 inches, and 30\r\ninches by 18 inches stroke, which developed 218 indicated horse power\r\nwith a consumption of 12.8 lb. of water per indicated horse power, and\r\nthis, together with some other observations, leads me to believe that the\r\nbest economical results will be obtained by running triple expansion\r\nengines at a much higher number of revolutions than is usual, and with a\r\nrate of expansion not less than 12 for a steam pressure not less than 140\r\nlb. (155 absolute). The largest engines we have made of this type so far\r\nare those of S.S. Martello, which have cylinders 31 inches, 50 inches,\r\nand 82 inches diameter by 57 inches strokes and indicate at sea 2,400\r\nhorse power when running at 60 revolutions with steam of 150 lb.\r\npressure; the consumption of Yorkshire coal is 37 tons per day average\r\nthroughout a New York voyage. Had Welsh coal been used in every case, the\r\nresults would have been very much better, for, in addition to the\r\nsuperior evaporative power of Welsh coal, it is slow burning and much\r\nmore easily controlled, especially on the comparatively short grates of\r\nthese modern boilers, the quick-burning Yorkshire coal causing the safety\r\nvalves to frequently blow off when working near the load pressure unless\r\ngreat care is taken by the firemen.\r\n\r\nI trust these few particulars may be of interest to the Institution, and\r\nespecially to those members of it who are particularly interested in the\r\ncommercial success of our mercantile navy. I have purposely avoided\r\nengineering details and technicalities of any kind, giving only such\r\ninformation as will tend to give British shipowners faith in that form of\r\nengine which will undoubtedly help them to successfully tide over bad\r\ntimes, and keep the bulk of the carrying trade of the world in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY HISTORY OF THE STEAM JACK.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American:_\r\n\r\n\r\nA friend has brought me a copy of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, of\r\nApril 18, 1885, containing an article about a \"steam jack.\"\r\n\r\nSays Mr. J.G. Briggs, in the _American Engineer:_ \"Of its origin nothing\r\nis known.\" Also the invention is attributed to \"Benjamin Baleh.\" I can\r\ngive you the true history of the \"steam jack.\" It was invented by my\r\ngrandfather, John Bailey, of Hanover, Plymouth County, Mass. He was a\r\nminister of some note in the Society of Friends, or Quakers.--a man of\r\nsuperior mental ability, but poor in purse, for, like all early\r\ninventors, he reaped but little pecuniary benefit from his inventions.\r\nAmong those inventions was the first iron sink in this country--if not in\r\nthe world. A few years ago that sink was in use at his old home in\r\nHanover. He also invented the crooked nose for the tea-kettle. Previous\r\nto that the nose was straight. Both sink and tea-kettle were cast at the\r\nMiddleborough foundry.

In designing the new work two leading\r\nconditions had to be fulfilled, namely, that there should be a single\r\nopening of 291 ft. between abutments, and that this width should be left\r\nquite unobstructed, for the river is subject to floods, which are\r\nfrequent, and very violent and sudden. For this latter reason an ordinary\r\nform of arch, with the roadway above it, was inadmissible, since the\r\nwaterway would be seriously obstructed; the special form illustrated was,\r\ntherefore, carried into execution. The bridge, as will be seen from Figs.\r\n1, 2, 3, and 7, consists of two main arched girders, with two vertical\r\nsides in lattice work; these arches spring below the level of the roadway\r\nand rise to a considerable height above it, in the center. The horizontal\r\ngirders carrying the roadway, are connected to the arches by verticals of\r\nthe form and section shown in the drawings. The longitudinal girders are\r\nof double trellis, as will be seen by reference to Figs. 1, 12, and 16.\r\nThe following are the principal dimensions of the bridge:\r\n\r\n                                     Ft. In.\r\nClear opening between abutments      291 4\r\nRise of arch                          32 9¾\r\nWidth of bridge                       37 4¾\r\nDepth of arched girders                4 7\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER ADIGE, AT VERONA.]\r\n\r\nThe arched girders are connected together, in the central portion, by a\r\nsystem of diagonal bracing, as is shown on Figs. 2 and 7. The carriage\r\nroad on the platform consists of buckled plates resting on transverse\r\ngirders spaced 6 ft. 6 in. apart, and covered with road metal, and for\r\nthe sidewalks checkered plates are used. The ironwork in the bridge\r\nweighs 400 tons, and cost 8,400 _l._; the abutments cost 3,600_l._,\r\nmaking the total outlay on the structure 12,000_l_. The bridge was\r\ntested by a uniformly distributed load of 82 lb. per sq. ft., and under\r\nthis stress the arched girders deflected 1.06 in. The horizontal and\r\nvertical oscillation of the bridge, which were carefully observed and\r\ngraphically recorded by special instruments, were very slight. The\r\nengineer of the work was Mr. G.B. Biadego, of Genoa.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUMPING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: A paper read at the Montreal Meeting of the British\r\nAssociation.]\r\n\r\nBy E.D. LEAVITT, JR., Cambridgeport, Mass.\r\n\r\nMINE PUMPING MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest steam engines, of any size, introduced into America,\r\nwas erected about the year 1763, at the Schuylkill copper mine, situated\r\nupon the Passaic River, in New Jersey. All its principal parts were\r\nimported from England; and a Mr. Hornblower (the son, it is believed, of\r\nthe well known engineer of that name) came to this country for the\r\npurpose of putting up and running this engine.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the manufacture of the engines for the Philadelphia\r\nWater Works was commenced, and as late as the year 1803, we find five\r\nengines, in addition to the one above mentioned, noticed as being used in\r\nthis country: two at the Philadelphia Water Works; one just about being\r\nstarted at the Manhattan Water Works, New York; one in Boston; and one in\r\nRoosevelt's sawmill, New York; also a small one used by Oliver Evans to\r\ngrind plaster of Paris, in Philadelphia. Thus, at the period spoken of,\r\nout of seven steam engines known to be in America, four were pumping\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nIn the coal regions of Pennsylvania, a simple, high pressure, single\r\nacting Bull engine has been extensively adopted; the dimensions usually\r\nrun from 36 inches to 80 inches in diameter, and a very common stroke is\r\n10 feet. At the Empire shaft, in the Schuylkill coal region, there is a\r\nvery fine pair of these engines, with 80 inch cylinders, working 24 inch\r\npumps. The stroke of both steam pistons and pumps is 10 feet. These Bull\r\nengines are placed either vertically or on an incline, as is most\r\nconvenient for the workings. The water valves are made either double,\r\ntriple, or four beat, according as the pumps are large or small; and the\r\nbeats are usually flat, and faced with leather. Many flap-valves are also\r\nin use. These are frequently arranged on conical seats, and work very\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nThe Bull engines, from their strength and simplicity, give very little\r\ntrouble, working year after year with astonishing freedom from accident\r\nand slight cost of repair. No attempt is made to economize fuel, which\r\nconsists mainly of culm, which would otherwise be wasted. Of late, direct\r\nacting steam pumps placed under ground have found much favor with mine\r\noperators, on account of their portability and small first cost. They\r\nusually range in size from 8 inch steam and 5 inch water cylinders by 12\r\ninch stroke to 80 inch stream and 14 inch water cylinders by 36 inch\r\nstroke. Great numbers of these pumps are in use all over the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nA pumping engine that is remarkable for its size and peculiarities of\r\nconstruction is located at the Lehigh zinc mine, at Friedensburg, Pa. It\r\nwas designed by Mr. John West, the company's engineer, and built by\r\nMerrick & Sons, of the Southwark Foundry, Philadelphia. It is a beam and\r\nfly-wheel engine, the steam cylinder being 110 inches in diameter, with a\r\nstroke of 10 feet. There are two beams on the same main center, from the\r\nouter end of which a double line of bucket and plunger pumps is operated.\r\nThe crank-shaft is underneath the steam cylinder; and there are two\r\nfly-wheels, one on each end of said shaft, the crank-pins being fast in\r\nthe hubs of the same. There are two connecting rods, which are attached\r\none to each end of an end beam pin 28 inches in diameter. The main center\r\nand crank shafts are also 28 inches in diameter; each of the two plunger\r\nholes is 24 inches by 30 inches in section; and all the working parts are\r\nin proportion to those heretofore mentioned.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no mining district has ever had to contend against greater\r\ndifficulties in pumping than have faced the engineers of the celebrated\r\nComstock lode, Virginia City, Nev. The mines are of great depth, in some\r\ninstances 3,300 feet; and the water is hot, rising to 160 degrees Fahr.\r\nThe machinery collected at this location is of great variety and\r\nmagnitude. There are many Davey engines, both horizontal and vertical.\r\nThe Union and Yellow Jacket shafts have compound fly wheel engines of\r\nvery great power; the former having a beam, and the latter being\r\nhorizontal, with cylinders placed side by side, and pistons connected to\r\na massive cross-head, from the ends of which connecting rods lead to\r\ncrank pins located in the hubs of the fly-wheels, which are overhung upon\r\nthe ends of the main shaft. From the center of the cross head, a link\r\nruns to the main pump-bob, which operates a double line of 16 inch pumps,\r\n10 foot stroke. The steam stroke is 12 feet. Depth of shaft, 3,300 feet.\r\n\r\nThe pumping machinery used in the iron and copper districts of Michigan\r\nusually consists of Cornish plunger pumps, which are operated by geared\r\nengines; the latter making from three to sixteen strokes to one of the\r\npumps.\r\n\r\nThe largest plant of this type yet erected is that of the Calumet and\r\nHecla copper mine, at Calumet, Mich. There are two lines of pumps,\r\nvarying in diameter from 7 inches to 14 inches, and with an adjustable\r\nstroke varying from 3 feet to 9 feet. The object of the adjustable stroke\r\nis to diminish the capacity of the pumps in the dry season. Each line of\r\npumps is driven from a crank placed on a steel spur-wheel shaft 15 inches\r\nin diameter, making ten revolutions per minute. The mortise spur-wheels\r\nhave a diameter of 22½ feet at the pitch line, with two rows of teeth,\r\neach 15 inches face. The pitch is 4.72 inches. Engaging with the mortise\r\nwheels are pinions of gun iron 4 feet 6 inches in diameter, placed on\r\nsteel shafts 12 inches in diameter, and making 50 revolutions per minute.\r\nThe 12 inch pinion shafts are driven through mortise wheels 12 feet in\r\ndiameter, and 24 inches face, by pinions 3 feet 9 inches diameter, which\r\nmake 160 revolutions a minute. The pinion shafts are driven through a\r\nwire rope transmission from an engine located 500 feet distant. The rope\r\nwheels are 15 feet in diameter, and make 160 revolutions a minute. The\r\nengine is 4,700 horse power, and, in addition to driving the pumping\r\nmachinery, does the hoisting and air compressing for the Calumet mine.\r\n\r\nIn the same building with the mine pump gearing is a duplicate\r\narrangement for operating the man engine. In order to operate the mine\r\npumps and man engine for the Hecla mine, it was necessary to use rock\r\nshafts, which are made of gun iron, and hollow; they are 32 inches in\r\ndiameter outside, with 4½ inches thickness of metal. The pump rock shaft\r\nis 39 feet 4½ inches long over all, in two sections, and weighs 40 tons.\r\nThere are rockers placed on each end of this shaft, one of which is\r\nconnected with a crank on the mortise wheel shaft, and the other with the\r\nsurface rods that work the pump-bobs. These rods are of Norway pine, 12\r\ninches by 12 inches in section, and 1,000 feet long. There are two bobs,\r\none above the other, with axes at right angles, each weighing about 25\r\ntons. The connection from the upper bob to the lower has hemispherical\r\npins and brasses to accommodate vibrations in right angled planes. The\r\nslope of the main pump is 39 degrees, and the machinery has been designed\r\nto raise water from 4,000 feet depth. The pumps are of the usual Cornish\r\nplunger type, with flap valves. There is an auxiliary engine, of the\r\nPorter-Allen type, for driving the pumps and man engines when the main\r\nengine is not working. It makes a 160 revolutions per minute, the same as\r\nthe rope wheels The seeming complication of the arrangement is due to the\r\nfact that it had to be adapted to existing works, for increased depths,\r\nand put in without interfering with the daily operation of the mine.\r\n\r\nThe Calumet & Hecla Mining Company has also an extensive pumping plant at\r\nits stamp mills, which are located on the shore of Torch Lake, about four\r\nand a half miles from the mine. There are located here 3 pumping engines;\r\ntwo of which have a capacity of 20,000,000 gallons a day, and a third\r\n10,000,000 gallons a day. The water is elevated between 50 and 60 feet,\r\nand is used for treating the stamped rock. Two of the engines are of the\r\ninverted compound beam and fly-wheel type; and the third is a geared\r\npump, which has a horizontal double acting plunger, 36 inches in\r\ndiameter, by six foot stroke, driven from the crank of a spur-wheel\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThe spur wheel is 12 feet diameter, 24 inches face, and contains 96\r\nteeth. The pinion engaging with it has 27 teeth, and is fast on the\r\nfly-wheel shaft of a Brown horizontal engine, having a cylinder 18 inches\r\nin diameter, and a stroke of four feet. The steam pressure used is 110\r\npounds per square inch; and the engine has a Buckley condenser. The pump\r\nvalves are annular, of brass, faced with rubber, and close by brass\r\nspiral spiral springs. Their external diameter is six inches, and the\r\nlift is confined to ½ inch. There are 91 suction and 91 delivery valves\r\nat each end of the pump. The maximum speed of this pump is twenty-six\r\ndouble strokes a minute.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the compound engines is named Ontario, and has a vertical\r\nlow pressure cylinder 36 inches in diameter, and an inclined high\r\npressure cylinder 17½ inches in diameter; the stroke of both being five\r\nfeet. These are inverted over a beam, or rocker; and the pistons are\r\nconnected to opposite ends of the same.\r\n\r\nThe beam attachment of the main connecting rod is made to a pin located\r\nabove and midway between the pins for piston connections.\r\n\r\nThe main center of the beam and the crank shaft have their pedestals in\r\nthe same horizontal plane. The throw of the crank is five feet. There are\r\ntwo differential plunger pumps, having upper plungers 20 inches in\r\ndiameter, and lower plungers 33 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 5\r\nfeet. These pumps are vertical, and placed beneath the engine bed-plate,\r\nto which they are attached by strong brackets. The pump under the low\r\npressure cylinder is worked directly from its cross-head by an extension\r\nof the piston rod. The other pump is worked by a trunk connection from\r\nthe opposite end of the beam. The radius of the beam is but fifty inches,\r\nbut the connections to it are made very long by links.\r\n\r\nThe lower plungers work through sleeves in diaphragms located in the\r\ncenter of the pumps. In these diaphragms, the openings for the delivery\r\nvalves are made. These valves are similar in construction to those\r\npreviously described for the horizontal plunger pump. Their diameter,\r\nhowever, is but 5¼ inches, instead of 6 inches, and there are 72 suction\r\nand 72 delivery valves for each pump. It will readily be seen that the\r\naction of these pumps is similar to that of the bucket and plunger; each\r\npump having one suction and two deliveries for each revolution of the\r\nengine. The Ontario is designed to run at a maximum speed of 33\r\nrevolutions a minute; and the service required of it is to run regularly\r\n144 hours a week, without a stop, which is performed with the utmost\r\nregularity.\r\n\r\nThe differential pump was invented and patented, many years since, by a\r\nparty named James Ramsden, in Pennsylvania, who designed it for an\r\nordinary house pump. It was subsequently reinvented by the writer, who\r\nfirst ascertained that he was not the original inventor upon applying for\r\na patent. A pump of this description was run at the Hecla mine for\r\nseveral years, at a speed of 500 feet a minute; and its performance was\r\nin every way satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECT ACTING STEAM PUMPS.\r\n\r\nThis class of machinery deserves a prominent place, as the number in use\r\nvastly exceeds those of all other types combined.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration will be given to the Worthington, which is the\r\npioneer of its type, having been invented by the late Henry R.\r\nWorthington, and patented in 1844. Mr. Worthington's first pump was\r\ndesigned for feeding boilers. His first water works engine was built for\r\nthe city of Savannah, Ga., and erected in 1854. The second engine, which\r\nwas the duplicate of the Savannah engine, was erected at the city of\r\nCambridge, Mass., in the year 1856, and was guaranteed to deliver 300,000\r\ngallons in twenty-four hours to an altitude of 100 feet. It had a high\r\npressure cylinder 12 inches in diameter, placed within a low pressure\r\ncylinder 25 inches in diameter; the low pressure piston being annular.\r\nThe double acting water plunger was 14 inches in diameter, and worked\r\ndirectly from the high pressure piston rod; the stroke of pistons and\r\nplunger being 25 inches. This engine was tested in 1860, with the result\r\nof a duty equal to 70,463,750 foot pounds per 100 pounds of coal.\r\nSubsequently, a test made by Mr. Frederick Graff, of Philadelphia (long\r\nprominently connected with the Philadelphia Water Department), and the\r\nlate Erastus W. Smith, of New York, developed a duty of 71,278,486 foot\r\npounds per 100 pounds of coal, which long remained the best record in the\r\nUnited States. In 1863, Mr. Worthington brought out at Charleston, Mass.,\r\nhis crowning success, the duplex engine, which fairly deserves to be\r\nplaced first among the hydraulic inventions of this century. This engine\r\nhas since been more extensively duplicated for water works purposes than\r\nany other, with the possible exception of the Cornish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED GUN PRESSURE GAUGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following description of the construction and mode of action is by\r\nThomas Shaw, M.E., Philadelphia, the inventor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED GUN PRESSURE GAUGE.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the gauge secured to small ordnance, the gun shown in\r\ncross section. Fig. 2 represents face view of the gauge and indicator,\r\nexposing a vertical section through the hydraulic portion of the gauge,\r\non line 3 and 4 of Fig. 1. The same principles of reduction of high\r\npressure are used in this gauge as in Shaw's hydraulic gauge. It will be\r\nobserved that a solid steel piston, E, in the cylinder, A, is provided\r\nwith a plunger on its under side, which comes in contact with an elastic\r\npacking, D; the plunger may stand as 1 to A 1,000, or as 1 to A 100, in\r\npoint of area of exposed surface, as compared with the large piston head,\r\nas desired. Assuming the proportions to be 1 to A 1,000, the 1,000 lb.\r\npressure on the plunger means only 1 lb. pressure in the fluid chamber,\r\nabove piston head, E, and this greatly reduced pressure is now\r\nsusceptible of measurement by any of the ordinary light pressure\r\ninstruments for measuring pressures. All the passage ways connecting to\r\ndial gauge, R, with the fluid chamber above piston, E, are filled solid\r\nwith fluid, permitting no air spaces that can be avoided. The steel plug,\r\nL, that forms a passage way between the fluid chamber and the dial gauge,\r\nis provided on one side with a small screw hydraulic pump, with a\r\nreservoir supply of fluid. This part is shown in longitudinal section;\r\nthe steel plunger, I, is firmly secured to wheel, F, the long hub, H, of\r\nwhich is provided with a screw thread on its inner side, which thread\r\nscrews upon the exterior of pump barrel, K. After first filling the\r\ninterior of the pump barrel with fluid, the said hub is screwed upon the\r\npump barrel, causing the plunger, I, to force the fluid into the fluid\r\nchamber and passage way leading to the dial gauge, causing the hand or\r\npointer to move to any predetermined pressure on dial, in advance of\r\npressure applied in the high pressure chamber at D. The purpose\r\naccomplished in this act is to give the least possible movement of the\r\npointer to record any maximum pressure, as, for example, assuming that\r\n20,000 lb. was the expected pressure from any one explosive, then the\r\npointer, by the means above described, can be set at, say, 18,000 lb., in\r\nwhich event the pointer is reduced to the minimum movement of only 2,000\r\nlb. to register 20,000 lb.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident that much greater accuracy of measurement of maximum\r\npressures can be obtained by the minimum movement of the pointer, as both\r\nthe inertia and the momentum are reduced to the minimum quantity. The\r\nsubsidence of pressure resulting from explosives being about as sudden as\r\nthe creation of pressure, causes the pointer to move too rapidly for\r\ncorrect ocular observation, on which account a static electric current is\r\nemployed, causing a stream of electric sparks to shoot off from the end\r\nof the pointer, B, to the brass outer ring, M. The gauge is insulated for\r\nthat purpose by glass plate, S, which is secured concentrically to the\r\ngauge proper and the ring, M. Binding posts for the electric wires are\r\nprovided at O and P, which wires are shown in Fig. 2. A spring clamp, N,\r\nFig. 2, enables the insertion of chemically prepared or other paper,\r\nwhich lies against the inner side of brass rim, M, and held in place by\r\nthe clamp, N. The electric sparks above spoken of pierce the strip of\r\npaper with small holes and colored marks. These holes, etc, show the\r\nexact limits to which the pointer has traveled under pressure, and thus\r\nan indelible record is kept by the electrical indications shown upon the\r\nstrip of paper. The paper can have the pressures corresponding to gauge\r\nprinted upon the same, when the holes are made prominent by holding the\r\npaper to the light, exposing an exact indication of the pressures or\r\nexplosives operated with.\r\n\r\nThe gases resulting from the explosives are injurious to the gauge\r\npackings, etc., on which account the bore in gun, W, and the connecting\r\nsteel plug, B, are filled with fluid. A screw plug, U, enables the\r\ninsertion of the fluid, after first pushing an elastic wad of rubber, B,\r\nor cork, in the bore near the inner wall of the gun, which wad will\r\nprevent the escape of the fluid to the interior, and be sufficiently free\r\nto prevent any interference with the pressures. The patentee and\r\nmanufacturer of this gauge is prepared to fill orders up to 50,000 lb.\r\nper square inch. This gauge is made of the best steel, and is very\r\ncompact, the weight being inside of twenty-five pounds.\r\n\r\nThe inventor has heretofore made mercury column gauges for gunpowder\r\npressures, which were too large for direct attachment to guns, but were\r\nconnected with special powder chambers to test the pressure, etc., of\r\nconfined explosives. The experience thus gained enabled the construction\r\nof the instrument here shown, which is adapted to direct attachment to\r\nthe gun, making it as easy now to measure gunpowder pressures as it had\r\nbeen, heretofore, to measure steam pressures. The effect of this movement\r\nis to reduce the exaggerated statement of high pressures, obtained from\r\nordinary sporting powders; these have been accredited with pressures up\r\nto 40,000 lb. per square inch, but they only really gave 22,000 lb. by\r\nactual gauge measurement. Artillerists and ordnance officers have, in\r\nthis instrument, a true pulse of the internal pressures of the gun, of\r\ninestimable value when determining the quantity of powder and the proper\r\nweight of shot. These are important matters in ordnance practice.\r\n\r\nThis gauge is a compact machine, designed to measure and indicate the\r\nquick pressures resulting from gunpowder explosives and the slow\r\npressures of hydraulic force; the same mechanism used in both cases\r\npermits the ready testing and examination of gauge under hydraulic\r\npressure, to determine its accuracy, for the more sudden pressure\r\noccasioned by the use of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED PLAITING MACHINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal object the inventors of the machine we illustrate herewith\r\nhad in view in designing it was to arrange a mode of working the grip\r\nmotion positively, so that the cloth shall be received freely and without\r\nstrain or friction before or up to the very instant at which each fold is\r\ncompleted, and shall then be seized and firmly held. In existing machines\r\nthere is not we believe, any arrangement for the accomplishment of this\r\npurpose; it is true, the table upon which the cloth is folded is relieved\r\nat the termination of the stroke of the plaiting knife, but the upper\r\ngripper bar, against which the folds of cloth are pressed upon the return\r\nof the table to its normal position, is stationary, being rigidly fixed\r\nto the sides of the machine. One result of this rigidity is that the\r\ncloth has to be forcibly thrust by the plaiting knife under the upper\r\ngripper bar, and in consequence of the violence involved the fold just\r\nmade at the opposite end is dragged out from the grip, making a short\r\nfold, and further, in the case of delicate finishes, giving rise to\r\ndamaged goods. Another result of this arrangement, when the cloth is not\r\npressed against the upper bar, is that it returns with the return stroke\r\nof the plaiting knife, the grip not being made until the knife is clear\r\nof the upper bar; thus the plaits or folds are made of irregular length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED PLAITING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nTo remedy this and to prevent its occurrence, Messrs. A. Edmeston and\r\nSons, Manchester, in the plaiting machines they are now manufacturing\r\nmake the upper gripper bar movable as well as the table below. Referring\r\nto the illustration, the upper gripper bars, A A, are capable of moving\r\nabout the center pins, B B, and when the machine is working are operated\r\nin the following manner:\r\n\r\nUpon the shaft, C, which revolves in unison with the crank shaft working\r\nthe plaiting levers and knife, are placed two cams, D, one at each end,\r\ninside the main frames. These cams engage with and work two escapement\r\nlevers or pallets, E E, upon which rest the feet of four rods, attached\r\none end to each of the upper gripper bars. Upon these four rods are\r\nhelical springs of sufficient strength to hold down, by means of the\r\ngrippers to which they are connected, the folds of cloth that have just\r\nbeen made. The cam, D, is so shaped that when the advancing plaiting\r\nknife and cloth reach the front edge of the gripper bar, the gripper is\r\nraised from the table to admit them freely. The instant the end of the\r\nstroke is reached the anchor pallet or lever, E, escapes from the cam,\r\nand the gripper bar is suddenly forced on to the knife and cloth by the\r\nsprings before mentioned, securely retaining the piece in its position.\r\nSimultaneously with the first of these motions the plaiting table itself\r\nis lowered, and, when the plaiting knife reaches the end of its stroke,\r\nis released by means of the levers and chains, F F, which are in\r\nconnection with the escapement pallets, E, and partake of their every\r\nmotion. These chains are so attached that they exert no effort upon the\r\ntable until the escapement lever is moved, thus permitting the plaiting\r\ntable to press upward against either one or both of the gripper bars with\r\nthe full force imparted to it by the weights and levers, G¹ G¹. The\r\nchains, furthermore, are also threaded over pulleys in such a manner that\r\nthey adjust themselves automatically to every position of the table and\r\nto the different thicknesses which the folded cloth acquires.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious from this description that in plaiting there is no\r\nmore strain put upon the cloth in placing it under the grip than is\r\nnecessary to draw it over the table from the feed rollers. This feature\r\ninsures perfect immunity from the dragging out of grip, as already\r\ndescribed, and renders the machine very useful for finishers and\r\nmakers-up, as the delicacy with which the cloth is handled prevents any\r\ndamage being done to the finish of the lightest fabrics. Double cloth\r\ncan, of course, be plaited by it equally well, and the precision and\r\nuniformity with which the cloth is plaited makes the machine thoroughly\r\nreliable as a cloth measurer.--_Tex.

The handrail,\r\nshuttle race, and starting handle can be at once recognized, and the\r\nshuttle guard will be seen in its proper position, which position it\r\nrigidly retains as long as the loom is working, but on a stoppage the rod\r\nswings back close underneath the handrail, and quite clear of the reed.\r\nThe mode in which this is accomplished we will endeavor to make clear.\r\nThe guard is connected to the starting lever by the arrangement shown,\r\nconsisting of a stud on the handle, on which, with the movement of the\r\nslay, lever, a, slides. This lever, by means of another lever and a link,\r\nis attached to the shuttle guard by the crank, b, which, by means of the\r\nset screw in the boss, permits the shuttle guard to be adjusted in the\r\nmost convenient place. It will be observed that whenever the loom stops\r\nworking, whether it is stopped by hand or automatically, the hand lever\r\nhas to be moved, and this movement is communicated to the shuttle guard\r\nby the mechanism just described, placing the guard rod beneath the hand\r\nrail, and leaving the whole of the shuttle race free and unencumbered.\r\nThe act of starting the loom brings the guard again to the working\r\nposition without any extra act having to be performed by the weaver. The\r\naction is entirely automatic, and the weaver has not anything to do that\r\nshe has not to do with the present unguarded looms. The arrangement\r\nappeared to ourselves to be a very efficient one, and it has the merit\r\nthat the length of the guard can be made greater than the width of the\r\ncloth, a further advantage that will be recognized by practical weavers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULER AND TRIANGLE FOR HATCHING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instrument shown in the cut is the invention of Mr. Maginnis, and is\r\ndesigned for producing equidistant hatchings. It consists of a short\r\nruler, A, and a triangle, B, supposed to be one of 45°, but which may be\r\nof any angle. The triangle carries two stops, c c, while the ruler is\r\nprovided with a conical piece, D, which is slotted, and is held by a\r\nscrew. The play that occurs between this conical slide and the stops\r\nvaries according to the position of the former.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RULER AND TRIANGLE FOR HATCHING.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus operates as follows: In the figure, the stop to the right\r\nbeing in contact with the piece, D, a line is drawn along the right side\r\nof the triangle. Then the ruler is made to slide along the triangle until\r\nD touches the other stop, and then the triangle is slid along the ruler\r\nuntil the stop to the right touches D again. In this position another\r\nline is drawn, and so on. The position of the piece, D, between the stops\r\nis regulated according to the fineness of the hatching to be\r\ndone.--_Chronique Industrielle_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DISTILLATION OF SEA WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supplying of the troops at Suakim and in the Soudan with water is one\r\nof the most important items in the whole conduct of the Egyptian war.\r\nEven in cold or temperate latitudes fresh water is a first necessity for\r\nanimal life; much more is this the case in the desert; and the wells in\r\nthe country forming the scene of our military operations form in\r\nthemselves valuable strategical points. Their supply, however, has to be\r\nsupplemented, and to do so artificial means and the aid of the engineer\r\nhave to be enlisted into this service.\r\n\r\nMany of our readers see notices from time to time in the newspapers about\r\nthis or that ship being employed, or at least her steam fittings, in\r\ndistilling water for the use of the troops; and although most of, if not\r\nall, our readers are engineers, still it is no disparagement to some of\r\nthem to assume that they are more or less unfamiliar with sea water\r\ndistillation on the scale on which the process is now being carried on at\r\nSuakim; and as the subject is of general interest, we give a short\r\ndescription of the process.\r\n\r\nIn a general sense, fresh water is obtained from sea water by simply\r\ngenerating steam from the sea water, passing the said steam through a\r\nsurface condenser, and filtering the resulting water. The obtaining of\r\nfresh water in this way has been in practice on board sea-going ships for\r\nmany years. It is supposed by some authorities on this subject that the\r\nfirst time fresh water was thus obtained at sea was by an old captain of\r\na brig which ran short of water, and he cut up some pewter dishes into\r\nstrips, which he bent and soldered into a pipe. He, with the carpenter's\r\naid, fitted a wooden lid in one of the cooking boilers, and fixed one end\r\nof his pipe in it. He next sawed a water cask in half, bored a hole in\r\nthe bottom of one half, and took his pipe through it, filling the space\r\nround the pipe with sea water. Thus he extemporized a worm and still or\r\ncondenser. The distilled water, however, was scarcely drinkable. Not to\r\nbe beaten, however, the captain got some pieces of charred wood which he\r\nput in the water, which so far improved it as to render it at all events\r\nfit to sustain life, and our skipper brought his brig and her screw\r\nsafely to port. What suggested the use of charcoal to his mind history\r\ndoes not tell. For many years past scarce any sea-going vessel leaves\r\nport that is not fitted with a properly constructed distiller; and one\r\nconspicuous advantage attending this practice is that each ship thus\r\nfitted to the satisfaction of the Board of Trade inspector is allowed to\r\nsail with only half the quantity of fresh water on board which she should\r\nhave if not provided with a distiller. The distiller and filter occupy\r\nvery much less space than that which would be occupied by the casks or\r\ntanks of water otherwise required to be carried.\r\n\r\nComing now a little to detail, sea water distillers are usually fitted in\r\nconnection with the winch and its boiler, which latter supplies the steam\r\nboth for distillation and to drive the engine working its circulating\r\npump. Smaller distillers are worked without a pump, the cooling water\r\nmerely passing through by gravitation. These smaller affairs again are of\r\ntwo kinds, the one being mounted at one end of the cooking hearth, as in\r\noutline sketch, which shows a two oven hearth with distiller at one end.\r\nA is the supply pipe to admit air to aerate the water; B is the cock\r\nwhere fresh water is drawn off; C is a pipe conveying cooling water to\r\nthe condenser E, placed on three little feet on top of the boiler, F,\r\nwhose steam rises up a central pipe to the dome top, where it expands out\r\nand returns downward through a number of tubes about 1 in. diameter, in\r\nwhich it is condensed, collected in a bottom chamber, and drawn off\r\nthrough the cock, B. A distiller of this size would make about thirty\r\ngallons of fresh water per day. Very frequently a distiller, such as is\r\nshown in the sketch, is mounted separately, and placed near the winch or\r\ndonkey boiler, which supplies it with steam, the lower part, F, being\r\nthen used as a filter. The diameter of E is from 15 in. to 18 in., the\r\nouter casing being either iron or copper. Another form of distiller is\r\none like the above, but larger, and having a small donkey engine and\r\ncirculating pump attached thereto. As a rule these distillers are\r\nvertical, but larger apparatus are arranged horizontally. To give our\r\nreaders some general idea of size, weight, and produce of water, we may\r\nsay that a plain cylindrical distiller, mounted on a square filter case,\r\nmeasuring 3 ft. 9 in. high, weighing 4½ cwt., will distill twelve gallons\r\nper hour. A larger size, measuring 6 ft. 2 in. high, and weighing about\r\n23 cwt., will give 85 gallons; while a still larger one, measuring 7 ft.\r\nhigh and weighing 32 cwt., yields 150 gallons. These have no pumps. When\r\nan engine and pump are fitted, the weight is increased from about 80 per\r\ncent. in the smaller to 50 per cent. in the larger sizes. An immense\r\nadvantage attends the use of those distillers that are combined with a\r\nwinch boiler. Of course, the chief use of the winch is while in dock;\r\nsome use is made of it at sea to do heavy pulling and hauling, to wash\r\ndecks, and in case of emergency the circulating pump is used as a fire\r\nengine. Were it not, however, for the distiller, the winch boiler would\r\nsimply be idle lumber at sea. The distiller, however, finds useful\r\nemployment for it, and has also this excellent effect, that as steam is\r\npretty constantly kept up for the distiller, in the evil event of a fire\r\nthe boiler is ready to work at once. In horizontal types of distiller an\r\nengine and pump are mounted on a cast iron casing as a bed, and in this\r\ncasing is placed a number of tubes through which the steam passes to be\r\ncondensed, the whole being simply a surface condenser with engine and\r\npump above. Another type is that of a small single-flued horizontal\r\nboiler with combustion chamber and twenty or thirty return tubes--in\r\nfact, the present high-pressure marine boiler on a small scale. A boiler\r\nof this sort, measuring 4 ft. to 5 ft. long, 3 ft. 9 in. to 4 ft. 6 in.\r\ndiameter, would have a horizontal donkey engine on a bed at its side, and\r\nat the end of the engine a vertical cylindrical condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFew have done more, perhaps none so much, as Dr. Normandy to make sea\r\nwater distillation not only a success as a source of water supply, but\r\nalso to supply it at a minimum cost for fuel. He by a peculiar\r\narrangement of pipes embodied something of the regenerative system in his\r\napparatus, using the heat taken from one lot of steam to generate more,\r\nand again the heat from this he used over again. The defect of his older\r\narrangements was undue complexity and consequent trouble to keep in\r\norder.\r\n\r\nAs can be well imagined, the distillers in use at Suakim are on a much\r\nmore colossal scale, and owing to the now almost universal use of surface\r\ncondensers in ocean steamers, no great difficulty ought to attend the\r\nadaptation of the boilers and condensers of one of our transports. One of\r\nthese full-powered steamers will indicate, say, 5,000 horse-power, and\r\nassuming her engines to use 25 lb. of steam per indicated horse-power, or\r\n2¼ gallons, she could distill some 12,000 gallons of water per hour. As\r\nno appreciable pressure of steam need be maintained, the boilers would\r\nsuffer little from deposit, especially if regularly blown out. Hard\r\nfiring need not be resorted to; indeed, it would be injudicious, as, of\r\ncourse, priming must be carefully guarded against. Of course, the salt\r\nwater distilled will affect the working, not exactly of the distillers,\r\nbut of the boilers. If the water in the harbor, as is not improbable, is\r\nmuddy, some method of filtering it before pumping it into the boilers\r\nought, if at all practicable, to be resorted to, for the twofold reason\r\nof preserving the boiler plates from muddy deposit, and also to prevent\r\npriming, which would certainly ensue from the use of muddy water. No\r\ndoubt the medical staff take care that the distilled water is alike\r\nthoroughly aerated and efficiently filtered. The most successful method\r\nof aerating is, we believe, to cause the current of steam as it enters\r\nthe condenser to suck in air by induced current along with it. The\r\nfiltering ought not to present any difficulty, as at all events sand\r\nenough can be had. Charcoal, however, is another affair, and all\r\ndistilled water ought to be brought into contact with this substance.\r\n\r\nSimple, however, as such an arrangement as this appears to be, practical\r\ndifficulties, which it is _said_ are insurmountable, stand in the way of\r\nits adoption, and the distilled water produced for Egypt is made in\r\nspecial apparatus, and various forms of condenser are employed, made\r\nunder various patents. The principle involved is, however, in all cases\r\nthe same. Steam is generated in one of the ships' boilers, and condensed,\r\nfiltered, and aerated in a special apparatus. The great objection to the\r\nuse of the ordinary surface condenser is that the main engines would, in\r\nthe majority of cases, have to be kept going, in order to pump the\r\ndistilled water out of the condenser, and to supply circulating water.\r\nBut it is easy to see that if engineers thought proper, this difficulty\r\ncould be readily got over. Separate circulating pumps, usually\r\ncentrifugal, are now freely used, and the addition of a special pump for\r\nlifting the condensed water presents no difficulty whatever. While the\r\nmain engines are running, the withdrawal of much condensed water would\r\nno doubt risk the safety of the boiler; but in the case of so-called\r\n\"distilling\" ships, there need be no trouble incurred on this\r\nscore.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAIDS TO CORRECT EXPOSURE ON PHOTOGRAPHIC PLATES.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: We take from the Br.

In this respect the subject will be found somewhat\r\nintractable. Scarcely two subjects will be found to send exactly the same\r\namount of light through the lens. However, a broad classification may be\r\nmade, and this has been done by Mr. Burton in his Table of Comparative\r\nExposures. A glance at this table will show how greatly the character of\r\nthe view may influence the time of exposure. Thus, with full aperture of\r\na rapid symmetrical, the exposure for open landscape is given as\r\none-twelfth of a second; when heavy foliage appears in the foreground,\r\nhalf a second will be required; while, under trees, as much as forty\r\nseconds may be needed.\r\n\r\nThe first aid I have to suggest is the use of such a table as Mr.\r\nBurton's. Before we do anything more in this direction, we must consider\r\nthe influence of the lens and its diaphragms. In theory the single\r\nlandscape lens is more rapid than the doublet of equal aperture, but the\r\ndifference is so little that it may be disregarded in practice, and my\r\nremarks will apply to both.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity of a lens depends mainly on its aperture and its focal\r\nlength. Thus a lens of twelve inches focus will require four times the\r\nexposure of a six inch, with an equal sized diaphragm, and a quarter inch\r\ndiaphragm will require four times the exposure of a half inch when used\r\nin the same lens.\r\n\r\nThe Photographic Society of Great Britain have recommended that the\r\ndiaphragms of all lenses should bear such relation to the focal length\r\nthat each should require exactly double the exposure of the next smaller.\r\nNow, if we turn again to Mr. Burton's table, we shall find that it is\r\nconstructed on this principle, and that each stop is numbered so as to\r\nshow its exposure. Obviously, the most sensible thing would be to get a\r\nset of stops made to correspond with this arrangement, but we will see\r\nhow we can construct a table for stops of any size.\r\n\r\nFirst, if possible, find the equivalent focus of your lens. If it is made\r\nby a known maker, you will find it in his price list, and if not, you may\r\ncalculate it for yourself by the rules given in the various text books,\r\nprovided you have a camera of pretty long focus. However, it will be near\r\nenough for our purpose if you get a sharp image of the sun on a piece of\r\npaper, and while you hold lens and paper, get some one to measure the\r\ndistance from the paper to the diaphragm aperture, or, in the case of a\r\nsingle lens, to the center of the lens. Note down this focal length, and\r\nproceed to measure your diaphragms in sixteenths of an inch.\r\n\r\nThen, with pen and paper, proceed to divide the diameter of each stop\r\ninto the focus, and state the result as a fraction of the focus, thus\r\nf/8. For example, a Ross half plate rapid symmetrical has a focal length\r\nof 7½ in.; for convenience reduce this to sixteenths=120. A diaphragm\r\nmeasuring seven sixteenths will give the fraction f/17. Now let us see if\r\nany of these stops correspond with Mr. Burton's. The first two in his\r\ntable will only be found in portrait lenses, but we shall probably find\r\none to correspond with the third, if we are using a doublet lens; with a\r\nsingle lens we won't find any so large. Having picked out those that\r\ncorrespond, and filled in the exposure for them, we have now to deal with\r\nthe odd sizes. Here is one, f/27, which is just half way between No. 16\r\nand No. 32, but a moment's thought will show that as the exposure\r\nincreases as the square of the diameter, it won't do to take the exposure\r\nhalf way between the two.\r\n\r\nWe have another factor to consider now: that is, the rapidity of the\r\nplate. If you use plates by a maker who has a name to sustain, you may be\r\npretty confident that they are of fairly uniform rapidity, so after you\r\nhave got into the way of working any particular brand, the best thing you\r\ncan do is to stick to it. The exposures in our table are for plates of\r\nmedium rapidity in good spring light. In my own experience I find that\r\nthey just suit \"thirty times\" plates, or fifteen on the sensitometer; but\r\nthen I like a full exposure with slow development, and I know that others\r\nfind these exposures just right for \"twenty times\" plates developed in\r\nthe usual way. The most rapid plates in the market will not be overdone\r\nwith half the given exposures. It must always be borne in mind that an\r\nerror of a fraction of a second in either direction may be corrected in\r\ndevelopment, and it is impossible to make a very serious error if you\r\nrefer to the table.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the light. If you depend on the eye entirely in judging\r\nthe quality of the light, it will sometimes play you tricks. The rays\r\nwhich are most active on the plates are those which have the least effect\r\non the eye. We can, however, by chemical means arrive at an exact\r\nestimate of the active power, and for this purpose an actinometer is\r\nused. This is simply an arrangement whereby a piece of sensitized paper\r\nis exposed and allowed to darken to a standard tint, and by the time it\r\ntakes to reach that tint the value of the light is judged. Capt. Abney\r\nhas, however, pointed out that ordinary sensitized paper is not suitable\r\nfor bromide plates, since there are conditions of light in which the\r\nplates will be fairly rapid while the paper will be very slow. He gives a\r\nformula for a bromide paper, which is treated with tannin in order to\r\nabsorb the bromine set free during exposure, otherwise the darkening\r\nwould be very slight. I used this paper for a while, but found it rather\r\nslow. The tannin also turned brown on keeping for a week or so. I then\r\nmade some more, substituting for tannin potassium _nitrite_ (not\r\nnitrate), which is colorless. This was an improvement, but still it was\r\njust slow enough.\r\n\r\nHowever, noticing in Capt. Abney's article the statement that the bromide\r\nof silver should be as nearly as possible in the same state in the paper\r\nas in the plate, I thought \"Why not Morgan's paper?\" This, of course, is\r\njust bromide emulsion on paper, and if, as I suspect from its color, it\r\ncontains a trace of iodide, why, so do most commercial plates. A sheet of\r\nthis paper cut into strips, soaked for ten minutes in a fifteen-grain\r\nsolution of potassium nitrite, and dried, gives a sensitive paper which\r\ndarkens with great rapidity to a good deep tint, and keeps indefinitely.\r\nHere is some prepared last summer, which is still quite good. To use this\r\npaper make a little box so that a little roll of it can be stored in one\r\nend, and drawn forward as required beneath a piece of glass.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that your table of exposures is calculated for the best\r\nspring light, go to the country some bright day next month with\r\nnote-book, actinometer, and the necessary appliances for exposing a few\r\nplates. Select, say, an open landscape, and use your smallest stop. When\r\nall ready to expose, get out your actinometer and expose it to the\r\nreflected light of the sky for ten seconds (if the sun is shining, turn\r\nyour back to it, and keep the actinometer in your own shadow); then put\r\nit in your pocket, expose a plate according to your table, and in case\r\nthe light or plate should not be just in accordance with the conditions\r\nunder which the table was prepared, expose other two plates, one a little\r\nless and one a little more than that first exposed. Then note down\r\neverything you have done--kind of view, stop, speed of plate, exposure of\r\neach plate, and length of exposure of actinometer.\r\n\r\nWhen you get home, the first thing to do is to get hold of a paint box\r\nand paint the underside of the glass of your actinometer to match the\r\ndarkened paper. Do this by gas light. Then scrape away a little of the\r\npaint, so as to let a strip of the paper be seen below it. After this\r\ndevelop your three plates with a developer of normal strength, and see\r\nwhich is best. If you have chosen a really bright spring day, and are\r\nusing plates of medium rapidity, you will most likely find that exposed\r\naccording to the table just about right.\r\n\r\nNow let us see how we can use these aids in our field work. We have\r\nascertained the correct exposure with a given stop on one class of view,\r\nwith light of a given quality, but now suppose all these conditions\r\naltered. Let the view have heavy foliage coming close up to the camera,\r\nthe stop be a size larger than that used in our first experiment, and the\r\nday rather dull. The table tells us what the exposure would be with this\r\nstop on this view, on a bright day; and if the actinometer take twenty\r\nseconds to reach the painted tint, then we must double the exposure given\r\nin the table.\r\n\r\nYou may sometimes find that the actinometer indicates a very different\r\nexposure from what the eye would lead you to expect. For instance, one\r\nday last September I went to Bothwell Castle, to get a picture I knew of\r\nin the grounds. It was one of those strange yellow days we had then, and\r\nthe sun, though shining with all his might, was apparently shining\r\nthrough orange glass. The actinometer indicated an exposure of thirty\r\nseconds where in good light one would be right. I was rather incredulous.\r\nThirty seconds in broad sunshine! However, I gave this exposure, but for\r\nmy own satisfaction I gave another plate fifteen seconds only.\r\n\r\nOn developing, the latter was hopelessly underexposed while that having\r\nthirty seconds gave a negative which furnished one of my exhibition\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nI have shown you how to reduce the quality of the light to a certainty,\r\nalso how to reduce to rule the exposure with different lenses and stops\r\non certain classes of subjects, and it remains with you only to guess\r\ncorrectly to what class the view you wish to take belongs; I can assure\r\nyou from my own experience that there is enough uncertainty about that\r\npoint to prevent good negatives ever becoming monotonous.\r\n\r\nThe only aid I can suggest in this case is the continual use of a\r\nnote-book. Note every plate you expose, and when you have a failure be\r\ncareful to record the fact, and you will gradually find these accumulated\r\nnotes becoming a great help in cases of doubt. One hint I can give to\r\nbeginners is that a great number of the pictures to be met with in this\r\npart of the country are intermediate between \"Open Landscape\" and\r\n\"Landscape with heavy foliage in foreground;\" and it is scarcely needful\r\nto say that if you are in doubt, let the exposure be rather too much than\r\ntoo little; you _may_ make a negative of an overexposed plate, but never\r\nof an underexposed one.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISOCHROMATIC PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Read at the stated meeting of the Franklin Institute, March\r\n18, 1885.]\r\n\r\nBy FRED. E. IVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the ordinary photographic processes do not\r\nreproduce colors in the true proportion of their brightness. Violet and\r\nblue photograph too light; green, yellow, orange and red, too dark. For a\r\nlong time it was believed to be impossible to remedy this defect; and\r\neven when it became known that bromide of silver could be made more\r\nsensitive to yellow and red by staining it with certain dyes, the subject\r\nreceived very little attention, because it was also known that the\r\nincrease of sensitiveness was too slight to be of practical value in\r\ncommercial photography.\r\n\r\nDr. H.W. Vogel, who was one of the first, though not the first, to devote\r\nattention to this subject, announced, in 1873, that he had succeeded in\r\nmaking a yellow object photograph lighter than a blue or violet one, by\r\nusing a silver-bromide plate stained with coraline, and exposed through a\r\nyellow glass. The plate showed no increased sensitiveness to red, and the\r\nexperiment, although of considerable scientific interest, did not\r\nindicate a practically useful process.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1878 I became interested in this subject, and tried to\r\ndiscover a method of producing plates which should be sensitive to all\r\ncolors, and capable of reproducing them in the true proportion of their\r\nbrightness. I commenced by trying nearly all the color sensitizers which\r\nhad already been suggested, in order to learn which was the best, and\r\nthen, if possible, _why_ it was the best, as a guide to further research.\r\nChlorophyl was the only thing I tried which was sufficiently sensitive to\r\nred to offer any encouragement in that direction; but the solution which\r\nI obtained was weak and unstable, and far from being a satisfactory color\r\nsensitizer. Hoping to obtain a better solution with which to continue my\r\nexperiments, I made extracts from many kinds of leaves, and found that a\r\nsolution from blue myrtle leaves looked better and kept better than any\r\nother, and when it was applied to the silver-bromide plates they became\r\nremarkably sensitive, not only to all shades of red, but also to orange,\r\nyellow, and green. By placing in front of the lens a color-screen\r\nconsisting of a small glass tank containing a weak solution of bichromate\r\nof potash, to cut off part of the blue and violet light, I obtained, with\r\nthese chlorophyl plates, the first photographs in which all colors were\r\nreproduced in the true proportions of their brightness. But my chief\r\ndesire at that time was to realize a method of producing from any object\r\nin colors a set of three negatives, in one of which the shadows should\r\nrepresent the blue of the original, in another the yellow, and in another\r\nthe red, in such a manner that transparent pigment prints from these\r\nnegatives--blue, yellow, and red--would, when superimposed on a white\r\nsurface, represent not only the lights and shadows, but also the colors\r\nof the object. This had already been attempted by others, who failed\r\nbecause their plates were not sufficiently sensitive to red and yellow.\r\n\r\nHaving succeeded perfectly in my undertakings, I published my discovery\r\nin 1879,[1] explaining how to prepare and use the chlorophyl plates, in\r\nconnection with the yellow screen, for the purpose of securing correct\r\nphotographs of colored objects.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Philadelphia Photographer_, December, 1879, p. 365.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I intended this publication to be a very full and explicit\r\none, and it was sufficiently so to be perfectly understood by most who\r\nsaw it; but some may think I did not sufficiently emphasize the\r\nimportance of using the particular kind of chlorophyl which I mentioned.\r\nIn a brief communication to the editor of the _Photo. News_, in 1883, I\r\ndescribed some experiments with eosine as a color sensitizer, and then\r\ncalled attention to the superiority of blue-myrtle chlorophyl for this\r\npurpose, stating that I had not been able to secure such results with any\r\nother kind of chlorophyl, and that a fresh solution from fresh leaves\r\nmust be used to secure the greatest possible degree of sensitiveness. See\r\n_Photo. News_, Nov. 1883, p. 747.]\r\n\r\nSo far as I know, nobody tried the process. Nearly five years later Dr.\r\nVogel announced that, after eleven years of investigation, he had at last\r\nrealized a successful process of this character, and that this new\r\nprocess of his was the \"solution of a problem that had long been\r\nencompassed with difficulty.\" This publication attracted a great deal of\r\nattention, and gave me occasion to again call attention to my process,[3]\r\nand point out that it was not only the first practical solution of this\r\nproblem, but the only truly isochromatic process ever discovered. Dr.\r\nVogel's new process was not only no better in any respect, but the plates\r\nwere insensitive to scarlet and ruby-red, and therefore would not\r\nphotograph all colors in the true proportion of their brightness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Photo. News_, London, September 5, 1884, p. 566, and _Year\r\nBook of Photography_ for 1885, p. 111.]\r\n\r\nMy method consists in treating ordinary collodio-bromide emulsion plates\r\nwith blue myrtle chlorophyl solution, exposing them through the yellow\r\nscreen, and then developing them in the usual manner. The emulsion which\r\nI have employed is made with an excess of nitrate of silver, which is\r\nafterward neutralized by the addition of chloride of cobalt; it is known\r\nas Newton's emulsion. I now prepare the chlorophyl from fresh blue myrtle\r\nleaves, by cutting them up fine, covering with pure alcohol, and heating\r\nmoderately hot; the leaves are left in the solution, and some zinc powder\r\nis added, which helps to keep the chlorophyl from spoiling. I have a\r\nbottle of this solution which was prepared about six months ago, and now\r\nappears to be as good as when first made.[4] A glass plate is flowed with\r\nthe emulsion, and as soon as it has set, the chlorophyl solution is\r\napplied for a few seconds, after which the plate is washed in pure water\r\nuntil smooth, when it is ready for exposure.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: I originally recommended chlorophyl extracted from dried\r\nleaves, because I had not yet learned how to preserve the solution for\r\nmore than a few weeks; and at some seasons it would be difficult, if not\r\nimpossible, to obtain fresh leaves. The tea organifier which I\r\nrecommended is also a color sensitizer, and when it is used in connection\r\nwith the chlorophyl from dried leaves the plates are as sensitive to red\r\nas can be safely prepared and developed in the light of an ordinary\r\nphotographic \"dark-room.\" Plates prepared with chlorophyl from fresh\r\nleaves do not require treatment with the tea organifier to secure this\r\ndegree of sensitiveness. Recently I have used the tea organifier and some\r\nother sensitizers, in connection with the solution from _fresh_\r\nmyrtle-leaves, and in this way have produced plates having such an\r\nexalted color sensitiveness as to be unmanageable in ordinary \"dark-room\"\r\nlight. Possibly, such plates might be prepared and developed in total\r\ndarkness, by the aid of suitable mechanical contrivances, but I am not\r\nsure that they would work clear even then, because they appear to be\r\nsensitive to heat as well as to light.]\r\n\r\nMy color-screen consists of a small plate-glass tank, having a space of\r\n3/16 of of an inch between the glass, filled with a solution of\r\nbichromate of potash about one grain strong. I place the tank in front of\r\nthe lens, in contact with the lens-mount. The advantage of this tank and\r\nsolution is that it can be more easily obtained than yellow plate glass,\r\nand the color can be adjusted to meet any requirement.\r\n\r\nThe plates require about three times as much exposure through the yellow\r\nscreen as without it, and may be developed with the ordinary alkaline\r\npyro-developer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IVES' PROCESS OF ISOCHROMATIC PHOTOGRAPHY.]\r\n\r\nIn order to illustrate the value of this process, I made two photographs\r\nof a highly-colored chromo-lithograph, representing a lady with a bright\r\nscarlet hat and purple feather, a yellow-brown cape and a dark-blue\r\ndress. One, by the ordinary process, represents the blue as lighter than\r\nthe yellow-brown, the bright scarlet hat as black, and the purple feather\r\nas nearly white. The other, by the chlorophyl process, reproduces all\r\ncolors in nearly the true proportion of their brightness, but with a\r\nslight exaggeration of contrast produced purposely by using a too-strong\r\ncolor solution in the small tank.\r\n\r\nI also made two landscape photographs, one by the ordinary process, and\r\nthe other by the chlorophyl process, exposing them simultaneously. In the\r\nordinary photograph, distant hills are lost through overexposure, yet the\r\nforeground seems underexposed, and yellow straw-stacks and bright autumn\r\nleaves appear black. In the chlorophyl photograph, the distant hills are\r\nnot overexposed, nor is the foreground underexposed; the yellow\r\nstraw-stacks appear nearly white, and bright autumn leaves contrast\r\nstrongly with the dark green about them.\r\n\r\nTo test the relative color-sensitiveness of plain emulsion plates, plates\r\nstained with eosine, and plates stained with the blue-myrtle chlorophyl,\r\nI exposed one of each kind through the same yellow screen, giving each\r\nfive minutes exposure, on the same piece of copy, which was the\r\nchromo-lithograph already described. The plain emulsion plate showed only\r\nthe high lights of the picture, after prolonged development. The eosine\r\nplate was underexposed, but brought up everything fairly well except the\r\nscarlet hat, which came up like black. The chlorophyl plate was\r\noverexposed, brought out all colors better than the eosine plate, and\r\ngave full value to the bright scarlet of the hat, the detail in which was\r\nbeautifully rendered.\r\n\r\nDr. Vogel advanced the theory that silver-bromide is insensitive to\r\nyellow and red, because it reflects or transmits those colors; and that\r\nit becomes sensitive when stained, because of the optical properties of\r\nthe dyes. He afterward admitted that only such dyes as are capable of\r\nentering into chemical combination with the silver-bromide proved capable\r\nof increasing its sensitiveness to color, but he held to the theory that\r\nthe optical properties of the compound were the cause of its\r\ncolor-sensitiveness.\r\n\r\nI have shown that the color-sensitiveness can be produced by treatment\r\nwith an organic compound which has none of the optical properties\r\ncharacteristic of dyes; and that chlorophyl, which absorbs only red\r\nlight, greatly increases the sensitiveness also to yellow and green.\r\nThere is, therefore, good reason to doubt if the color-sensitiveness is\r\never due to the optical properties of the dye or combination.\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to produce isochromatic gelatine dry plates\r\nwhich, while many times more sensitive to white light than my chlorophyl\r\nplates, shall also show the same relative color-sensitiveness. Such\r\nplates would be very valuable but for one fact: it would be necessary to\r\nprepare and develop them in almost total darkness. Gelatine bromide dry\r\nplates extremely sensitive to yellow, but _comparatively insensitive to\r\nred_, might be used to advantage in portrait and instantaneous\r\nphotography, because they could be safely prepared and developed in red\r\nlight; but when truly isochromatic photographs are required, the time of\r\nexposure must be regulated to suit the degree of sensitiveness to red,\r\nwhich cannot safely be made greater than I have realized with my\r\nchlorophyl process.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTORTION FROM EXPANSION OF THE PAPER IN PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of the unequal expansion of paper, when wetted, in causing\r\ndistortion of the photographic image impressed upon it, has, in the case\r\nof ordinary photographs upon albumenized paper, been well recognized; but\r\nthe extent to which such distortion may exist under different treatment\r\nis worthy of some special consideration, particularly with reference to\r\nthe method of printing upon gelatinized paper, which has been thought by\r\nsome likely to supersede the method now usually employed with albumenized\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nWhen a print upon the ordinary photographic (albumen) paper is wetted,\r\nthe fiber expands more in one direction than in the other, so that the\r\nprint becomes unequally enlarged, very slightly in one and much more so\r\nin the other way of the paper. When the paper is dried without any strain\r\nbeing put upon it, the fibers regain very nearly their original\r\ndimensions and position, so that the distortion which has existed in the\r\nwet condition nearly disappears.\r\n\r\nIf the photograph is cemented, while in the expanded condition, upon a\r\nrigid surface, the distortion then existing is fixed, and rendered\r\npermanent. Such a cementation or method of mounting is that which has\r\nbeen generally adopted, and the consequence has been that every now and\r\nthen complaints have justly been made of the untruthfulness--owing to\r\nthis particular distortion--of photographs; productions whose chief merit\r\nhas often been asserted to consist in their absolute truthfulness. This\r\ndistortion is very manifest when, in a set of portraits, some of the\r\nprints happen to have been made in one direction of the paper, and others\r\nwith the long grain the other way. I have known a case where a proof\r\nhappened to increase the face in width, and all the other prints\r\nincreased it in length. Of course, neither was correct, but the proof had\r\nbeen accepted and liked, and the remainder of the set had to be reprinted\r\nwith the grain of the paper running in the same direction as that in the\r\nfirst one which had been supplied.\r\n\r\nAnother evil arising from mounting prints while expanded with moisture\r\nis, that in drying the contraction of the paper pulls round the card into\r\na curved form and although by rolling this curvature may be temporarily\r\ngot rid of, the fiber of the paper is in a strained condition, and the\r\nbent state of the mount is, sooner or later, renewed thereby.\r\n\r\nTo remedy these evils it has been proposed to mount the print when dry,\r\nby forcible pressure against a slightly damped card, the back of the\r\nprint having been previously coated with a cement and dried. This plan\r\nis, to a great extent, successful; but that it does not give absolute\r\nimmunity from distortion is, I think, evident from the following\r\nconsideration. The prints, after being mounted a few days, will show a\r\ncertain tendency to curl inward. This curling, I take it, is a measure of\r\nthe strain upon the print, produced by the more complete return to its\r\noriginal dimensions of the paper photograph. Probably it would be well to\r\nkeep the prints a few days after drying, or to subject them to\r\nalternations of damp and dryness, in order to facilitate this complete\r\nreturn before being placed upon the card. The evil of distortion is,\r\nhowever, very slight--perhaps imperceptible--compared with that existing\r\nwhen the prints are mounted wet. I may mention, _en passant_, that I have\r\nfound gum much more satisfactory as a mountant than starch paste in what\r\nis known as the \"dry mounting\" system.\r\n\r\nThe paper which has recently been introduced for producing prints by\r\ndevelopment upon a gelatine surface does not generally, when dried in the\r\nusual way, give so good or so brilliant a surface as that of albumenized\r\npaper; but on the other hand it is very easy with it to obtain what is\r\ncalled an enamel surface, by simply allowing it to dry in contact with a\r\nprepared surface of glass. This method of finishing has therefore been\r\nmuch recommended and adopted, but without consideration of the effect of\r\ndistortion in connection with it. In an ordinary photograph the print is\r\nmounted damp, but in the case of a print squeegeed on to the glass, the\r\npaper is saturated and thoroughly swollen, and the use of the squeegee\r\nstrains it out to its fullest extent. By drying in the position in which\r\nit has been held by contact with the glass, the distortion becomes fixed,\r\nand if the print is mounted while in this state the distortion is made\r\npermanent. How long the strain and distortion remain in an unmounted\r\nprint, and whether by time and alternations of moisture and dryness the\r\nstrain would be lost, and if so, whether the brilliant enamel surface\r\nwould go at the same time, are questions worthy of further investigation\r\nand discussion.\r\n\r\nFor mounting prints upon developed gelatine paper, it has been\r\nrecommended to cement the edges only, so as to leave the greater part of\r\nthe print with its enamel surface. This plan is unsatisfactory, for two\r\nreasons, besides the objection on the ground of distortion. There is a\r\nrough-looking margin which spoils the continuity of appearance,\r\nespecially (as in the specimens I have seen) where the line of cement is\r\nnot kept at an exact width, but encroaches here and there.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the print, from not being attached to the mount all over, is\r\napt, especially when in a large size, to be somewhat wavy and wanting in\r\nflatness. Another plan recommended, as giving a surface resembling\r\nalbumen paper, is to paste the back of the print without moistening the\r\nsurface, and so mount. Some prints that have been shown thus treated had\r\nso strongly curled the cards upon which they were mounted that it is\r\nevident there was considerable strain and consequent distortion.\r\n\r\nA third plan recommended is to paste the back of the print while in\r\ncontact with the glass upon which it has to dry; and, when dried, to\r\nmount by passing through a rolling press with a damped card. This plan\r\nlooks, at first sight, like that recommended for albumen paper, and\r\ncalled \"dry\" mounting. Consideration, however, will show that there is a\r\nradical difference. In the case of the albumen paper the print has been\r\ndried without strain, and therefore but little change is to be looked\r\nfor, while the print dried in contact with glass is strained to the\r\nutmost, causing present distortion and future curling of the mount.\r\nPerhaps the evil of distortion caused by enameling may be reduced to a\r\nminimum by soaking the print in alcohol previous to laying it upon the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nSince the distortion of the photograph arises from the unequal expansion\r\nof the paper when wet, it becomes a question whether something may not be\r\ndone in the selection of the paper itself. It may be that some makes vary\r\nmuch less than others in the \"length against width\" extension of the\r\nsurface by wetting. It must be remembered that for gelatine emulsion we\r\nare not nearly so limited in the selection of paper as when it is\r\nrequired to be albumenized. In the latter case the image is in the paper,\r\nwhereas with gelatine the image is contained in the surface coating. I\r\nmay mention that the best plain, i.e., not enameled, but resembling that\r\nof ordinary albumen paper, surface that I have seen upon gelatine paper\r\nwas upon some foreign post that I had obtained for another purpose. The\r\nemulsion employed was that described by Mr. J.B.B. Wellington, and this\r\ngentleman agreed with me in attributing the superiority of the surface\r\nobtained to the fine quality of the paper upon which the emulsion had\r\nbeen coated. Some commercial samples appear to be coated upon paper of\r\nsomewhat coarse texture. This does not show when the print is enameled.\r\n\r\nThe unequal expansion of paper is a subject of interest, not only in\r\nconnection with gelatine paper for development, but with various\r\nphotographic processes. In making carbon transparencies for instance, the\r\ngelatine film which is squeegeed against the glass necessarily takes its\r\ndimensions from the paper to which it is attached, and if that be\r\nexpanded more in the one direction than another, the transparency is\r\nsimilarly deformed; and so, of course, is any negative, enlarged or\r\notherwise, produced in the camera therefrom. A reproduced negative by\r\ncontact printing may either have the distortion due to expansion of the\r\npaper bearing the gelatine film removed or doubled, according to the\r\ndirection in which the paper is used for the new negative.--_W.E.\r\nDebenham, in Br.

Lebasteur. He spreads upon the\r\nplate the thickness of which he desires to find, and also upon a piece of\r\nsheet iron of known thickness, a layer of tallow about 0.01 inch thick.\r\nHe then applies to each, for the same length of time, a small object,\r\nsuch as a surgeon's cauterizing instrument, heated as nearly as possible\r\nto a constant temperature. The tallow melts, and as in the thicker plate\r\nthe heat of the cautery is conducted away more rapidly, while in the thin\r\nplate the heat is less freely conducted away, and the tallow is\r\nconsequently melted over a large area, the diameters of the circles of\r\nbare metal around the heated point, bounded after cooling by a little\r\nridge of tallow, will be to each other inversely as the thickness of the\r\nplates. The process is stated to have given in the inventor's hands,\r\nresults of great accuracy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUPS OF STATUARY FOR THE PEDIMENT OF THE HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT IN\r\nVIENNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pediment of the central pavilion and the two side pavilions of the\r\nnew House of Parliament, at Vienna, are to be ornamented with groups of\r\nstatuary.

FRITTS, 42 Nassau St., New York, N.Y.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all previous cells, so far as I am aware, the two portions or parts of\r\nthe selenium at which the current enters and leaves it have been in\r\nsubstantially the same electrical state or condition. Furthermore, the\r\npaths of the current and of the light have been transverse to each other,\r\nso that the two forces partially neutralize each other in their action\r\nupon the selenium. Lastly, the current flows through not only the surface\r\nlayer, which is acted upon by the light, but also the portion which is\r\nunderneath, and not affected thereby, and which therefore detracts from\r\nthe actual effect of the light upon the selenium at the surface.\r\n\r\nMy form of cell is a radical departure from all previous methods of\r\nemploying selenium, in all of these respects. In the first place, I form\r\nthe selenium in very thin plates, and polarize them, so that the\r\nopposite faces have different electrical states or properties. This I do\r\nby melting it upon a plate of metal with which it will form a chemical\r\ncombination, sufficient, at least, to cause the selenium to adhere and\r\nmake a good electrical connection with it. The other surface of the\r\nselenium is not so united or combined, but is left in a free state, and a\r\nconductor is subsequently applied over it by simple contact or pressure.\r\n\r\nDuring the process of melting and crystallizing, the selenium is\r\ncompressed between the metal plate upon which it is melted and another\r\nplate of steel or other substance with which it will not combine. Thus by\r\nthe simultaneous application and action of heat, pressure, chemical\r\naffinity, and crystallization, it is formed into a sheet of granular\r\nselenium, uniformly polarized throughout, and having its two surfaces in\r\nopposite phases as regards its molecular arrangement. The non-adherent\r\nplate being removed after the cell has become cool, I then cover that\r\nsurface with a _transparent conductor of electricity_, which may be a\r\nthin film of gold leaf. Platinum, silver, or other suitable material may\r\nalso be employed. The whole surface of the selenium is therefore covered\r\nwith a good electrical conductor, yet is practically bare to the light,\r\nwhich passes through the conductor to the selenium underneath.[5] My\r\nstandard size of cell has about two by two and a half inches of surface,\r\nwith a thickness of 1/1000 to 5/1000 inch of selenium. But the cells can,\r\nof course, be made of any size or form. A great advantage of this\r\narrangement consists in the fact that it enables me to apply the current\r\nand the light to the selenium in the same plane or general direction,\r\ninstead of transversely to each other as heretofore done, so that I can\r\ncause the two influences to either coincide in direction and action, or\r\nto act upon opposite faces of the selenium and oppose each other,\r\naccording to the effect desired.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The method of constructing the cells was described in the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, No. 462, for Nov. 8, 1884, page 7371.]\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the process and arrangement described, my cells have a\r\nnumber of remarkable properties, among which are the following:\r\n\r\n1. _Their sensitiveness to light_ is much greater than ever before known.\r\nThe most sensitive cell ever produced, previous to my investigations, was\r\none made by Dr. Werner Siemens, which was 14.8 times as conductive in\r\nsunlight as in dark. In table A, I give results obtained from a number of\r\nmy cells.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that I have produced one cell which was 337.5 times\r\nas conductive in hazy sunlight as in dark. The tremendous change of\r\nresistance involved in the expression \"337.5 times\" may perhaps be more\r\nfully realized by saying that 99.704 _per cent_. of the resistance had\r\ndisappeared temporarily, under the joint action of light and electricity,\r\nso that there remained _less than 3/10 of 1 per cent_. of the original\r\nresistance of the selenium in dark.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain these high results, the cells must be protected from\r\nlight when not in use. The resistance is first measured while the cell is\r\nstill in total darkness. It is then exposed to sunlight and again\r\nmeasured. It is also necessary to send the current in at the gold\r\nelectrode or face, as the cell is much less sensitive to light when the\r\nlight acts upon one surface of the selenium and the current enters at the\r\nopposite surface. When the two influences, the light and the current, act\r\nthrough the gold, in conjunction, their forces are united; and, as every\r\natom of the selenium is affected by the light, owing to the extreme\r\nthinness of the plate, we have the full effect shown in the measurements.\r\n\r\n                          TABLE A.\r\n\r\n                   SENSITIVENESS TO LIGHT.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\nSelenium  |  Battery  | Resistance in | Resistance in |\r\n  cell.   |  power.   |     dark.     |   sunlight.   |  Ratio.\r\n----------+-----------+---------------+---------------+----------\r\n          |           |    ohms.      |   ohms.       |\r\n No. 22   |5 elements.|    39,000     |    340        |114   to 1\r\n  \"  23[6]|5     \"    |    14,000     |    170        | 82.3  \" \"\r\n  \"  24[7]|5     \"    |   648,000     |  2,400        |270    \" \"\r\n  \"  25   |5     \"    |   180,000     |    930        |196.5  \" \"\r\n  \"  26   |5     \"    |   135,000     |    710        |190    \" \"\r\n  \" 107   |5     \"    |   118,000     |    740        |159    \" \"\r\n  \" 108   |5     \"    |   200,000     |    900        |222    \" \"\r\n  \" 122   |5     \"    |    56,000     |    220        |254.5  \" \"\r\n  \" 129[6]|5     \"    |   200,000     |    940        |212    \" \"\r\n  \" 137   |5     \"    |   108,000     |    320        |337.5  \" \"\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Cells No. 23 and No. 129 are now in possession of Prof. W.\r\nGryllis Adams, of King's College, London; Dr. Werner Siemens has No. 25,\r\nand Prof. George F. Barker, of Philadelphia, has No. 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: No. 24 was measured with a bridge multiplier of 6 to 1.]\r\n\r\nCells which are sensitive to light improve by being used daily, and their\r\nsensitiveness becomes less if they are laid aside and not used for a\r\nconsiderable length of time, especially if allowed to become overheated.\r\nThey should be kept cool, and exposed to light frequently, whether they\r\nare used or not.\r\n\r\n_Mode of measuring cells_.--So great is the sensitiveness of these cells\r\nto external influences, that it is necessary to adopt some particular\r\nsystem in measuring their resistance and to adhere strictly to that\r\nsystem, as every change in the method of measurement produces a\r\ndifference in the result, and the different measurements would not be\r\ncomparable with each other. The reason for this will be explained\r\npresently.\r\n\r\nThe system I have adopted is the Wheatstone's bridge arrangement, with\r\nequal sides, never using multipliers except for some experimental\r\npurpose. In each multiplier wire I have 500 ohms resistance. When the\r\nbridge is balanced, one-half of the current flows through the cell and\r\nacts upon the selenium. Between the bridge and the cell is a reversing\r\nswitch, so that the current can be reversed through the cell without\r\nchanging its course through the bridge. A Bradley tangent galvanometer is\r\nused, employing the coil of 160 ohms resistance. The Leclanche battery is\r\nexclusively used in measurements for comparison.\r\n\r\n2. _The kind of battery employed_ has a marked effect upon the\r\nsensitiveness to light, which is largely reduced or entirely destroyed\r\nwhen the bichromate battery is used. The same cells again become\r\nextremely sensitive with the Leclanche battery. We might expect that a\r\nchange in the current employed would cause a change in the _resistance_\r\nof a cell, but it is not clear how or why it should affect the\r\n_sensitiveness of selenium to light_.\r\n\r\n\"If one kind of battery current destroys its sensitiveness, may we not\r\nsuppose that another kind might increase its sensitiveness? Although the\r\nLeclanche has operated well, some other may operate still better, and by\r\nits special fitness for use on selenium cells may intensify their\r\nactions, and so bring to light other properties yet unthought of. Is not\r\nhere a promising field for experiment, in testing the various forms of\r\nbattery already known, or even devising some new form especially adapted\r\nto the needs and peculiarities of selenium cells?\"\r\n\r\nOne year ago I made the foregoing suggestion in a paper on _A New Form of\r\nSelenium Cell_, presented before this Association at Minneapolis. I am\r\nnow at liberty to state that my photo-electric battery, presently to be\r\ndescribed, marks an advance in the direction indicated. The current from\r\nthis battery increases the sensitiveness of the cells to light, and also\r\nto reversal of current. One cell whose highest ratio in light was about\r\n83 to 1, with the Leclanche battery, when measured with my battery gave a\r\nratio of 120 to 1. It seems to make the resistance of the cell both\r\nhigher in dark and lower in sunlight than with the Leclanche battery. But\r\nthe field is yet open to others, for the discovery of a battery which may\r\nbe still better for use with selenium cells.\r\n\r\n3. _The two surfaces of the selenium act differently toward currents_\r\nsent into them from the contiguous conductors. One surface offers a\r\nhigher resistance to the current than the other. The former I utilize as\r\nthe anode surface, as I have found that the cell is more sensitive to\r\nlight when the current enters at that surface, which is ordinarily the\r\none covered by the gold or other transparent conductor. Some cells have\r\nthis property but feebly developed; but in one instance the resistance\r\noffered to the current by the anode surface was 256 times as high as that\r\noffered by the cathode surface to the same current. In the majority of\r\ncases, however, the ratio does not exceed ten times. Table B gives some\r\nrecent results.\r\n\r\n                           TABLE B.\r\n\r\n      SENSITIVENESS TO REVERSAL OF DIRECTION OF CURRENT.\r\n\r\n-----------------------+--------------+------------------+---------\r\n                       |              |   Resistance     |\r\n    No. of cell.       |   Battery.   | \"gold  | \"gold   | Ratio\r\n                       |              | anode.\"|cathode.\"|\r\n-----------------------+--------------+--------+---------+---------\r\n                       |              |  ohms. |  ohms.  |\r\n3/8 inch square.

I can, therefore, vary the resistance of one of\r\nmy cells in many ways, and the following may be specified--\r\n\r\n(a) By changing the potential or electromotive force of the current\r\nthrough the cell.\r\n\r\n(b) By changing the \"quantity\" of the battery or current.\r\n\r\n(c) By putting more or less resistance in the circuit.\r\n\r\n(d) By dividing the current, by one or more branch circuits or shunts\r\naround the cell.\r\n\r\n(e) By varying the resistance in any or all of said circuits.\r\n\r\nA cell whose resistance becomes greater as the battery power becomes\r\ngreater, and _vice versa_, I call an \"L B cell\" signifying _Like the\r\nBattery power_. A \"U B cell\" is one whose resistance becomes greater as\r\nthe battery power (or strength of current) becomes less, and _vice\r\nversa_, being _Unlike the Battery power_, or current strength.\r\n\r\nThese changes of resistance are not due to heating of the conductor or\r\nthe selenium, and the following instance will illustrate this. I have one\r\ncell in which the selenium has about one-fourth inch square of surface\r\nmelted on a brass block one inch thick. This cell measured, with 25\r\nelements of Leclanche, 40,000 ohms. On changing the battery to 5 elements\r\nthe resistance fell instantly to 30 ohms, and there remained. On again\r\nusing the current from 25 elements, the resistance instantly returned to\r\n40,000 ohms. Had these results been due in any degree to heating, the\r\nresistance would have changed gradually as the heat became communicated\r\nto the brass, whereas no such change occurred, the resistances being\r\nabsolutely steady. Moreover, even the fusion of the selenium would not\r\nproduce any such change.\r\n\r\nThe \"U B\" property does not ordinarily change the resistance of the cell\r\nto exceed ten times, i.e., the resistance with a weak current will not be\r\nover ten times as high as with a strong one. But I have developed the \"L\r\nB\" property to a far higher degree. Table C gives some recent results\r\nobtained with L B cells, including one whose resistance, with 25 elements\r\nLeclanche, was 11,381 times as high as with 8 elements, and which, after\r\nstanding steadily at 123 ohms (and then at 325 ohms with 1 element), on\r\nreceiving the current from 25 elements again returned to its previous\r\nfigure of 1,400,000 ohms.\r\n\r\n                         TABLE C.\r\n\r\n          SENSITIVENESS TO CHANGE OF BATTERY POWER.\r\n-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------\r\n                       | Resistance | Resistance |\r\n       No. of cell.    |   with 25  |   with 5   |  Ratio of\r\n                       |  elements. |  elements. |   Change.\r\n-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------\r\n                       |  ohms.     |  ohms.     |\r\n3/8 inch square, No. 1 |    40,000  |     30     |  1,333 to 1\r\n3/8  \"     \"      \"  2 |    13,000  |     40     |    325  \"\r\n1/4  \"     \"      \"  1 | 1,400,000  |    123[8]  | 11,381  \"\r\n1/2  \"     \"      \"  2 |   500,000  |     62     |  8,064  \"\r\n1/2  \"     \"      \"  5 |     3,500  |     21     |    167  \"\r\n   Full size, No. 81   |    68,000  |    121     |    561  \"\r\n    \"    \"     \"  82   |     9,000  |     64     |    140  \"\r\n    \"    \"     \"  83   |    17,300  |     74     |    233  \"\r\n    \"    \"     \" 119   |    35,600  |     19     |  1,894  \"\r\n-----------------------+------------+------------+-------------\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This measurement was obtained with 8 elements.]\r\n\r\nThe results in the table were obtained by changing the strength of\r\ncurrent by throwing in more or less of the battery. Like results can be\r\nobtained by varying the current through the cell by any of the other\r\nmethods before specified. The above measurements were in dark.\r\n\r\n5. _Dual state of selenium_.--My cells, when first made seem to have two\r\nstates or conditions. In one, their resistance is very low, in the other\r\nit is high. When in the low state they are usually not very sensitive, in\r\nany respect. I therefore raise the resistance, by sending an intermittent\r\nor an alternating current though the cells, and in their new condition\r\nthey at once become extremely sensitive to light, currents, and other\r\ninfluences. In some cases they drop to the low state again, and require\r\nto be again brought up, until, after a number of such treatments, they\r\nremain in the sensitive state. Occasionally a cell will persist in\r\nremaining in the insensitive state. The before mentioned treatment raises\r\nit up for a moment, but, before the bridge can be balanced and the\r\nresistance measured, it again drops into the low or insensitive state.\r\nSome cells have been thus stimulated into the high or sensitive state\r\nrepeatedly, and every means used to make them stay there, but without\r\navail; and they have had to be laid aside as intractable.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier stages of my investigations, before the discovery of this\r\ndual state and the method of changing a cell from the insensitive to the\r\nsensitive condition, hundreds of cells were made, finished, and tested,\r\nonly to be then ruthlessly destroyed and melted over, under the\r\nimpression that they were worthless. Now, I consider nothing worthless,\r\nbut expect sooner or later to make every cell useful for one purpose or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe most singular part of this phenomenon is the wide difference in the\r\nresistance of the cells in the two states. In the low state, it may be a\r\nfew ohms, or even a few hundredths of an ohm. In the high state, it is\r\nthe normal working resistance of the cell, usually between 5,000 and\r\n200,000 ohms, but is often up among the millions. The spectacle of a\r\nlittle selenium being stimulated, by a few interruptions of the current\r\nthrough it, into changing its resistance from a fraction of an ohm up to\r\na million or several millions of ohms, and repeatedly and instantly\r\nchanging back and forth, up and down, through such a wide range, we might\r\nalmost say changing from zero to infinity, and the reverse, instantly, is\r\none which suggests some very far-reaching inquiries to the electrician\r\nand the physicist. What is the nature of electrical conductivity or\r\nresistance, and how is it so greatly and so suddenly changed?\r\n\r\n6. _Radio-electric current generators_.--My cells can be so treated that\r\nwill generate a current by simple exposure to light or heat. The light,\r\nfor instance, passes through the gold and acts upon its junction with\r\nthe selenium, developing an electromotive force which results in a\r\ncurrent proceeding from the metal back, through the external circuit, to\r\nthe gold in front, thus forming a photo-electric dry pile or battery. It\r\nshould preferably be protected from overheating, by an alum water cell or\r\nother well known means.\r\n\r\nThe current thus produced is radiant energy converted into electrical\r\nenergy directly and without chemical action, and flowing in the same\r\ndirection as the original radiant energy, which thus continues its\r\ncourse, but through a new conducting medium suited to its present form.\r\nThis current is continuous, constant, and of considerable electromotive\r\nforce. A number of cells can be arranged in multiple arc or in series,\r\nlike any other battery. The current appears instantly when the light is\r\nthrown upon the cell, and ceases instantly when the light is shut off. If\r\nthe light is varied properly, by any suitable means, a telephonic or\r\nother corresponding current is produced, which can be utilized by any\r\nsuitable apparatus, thus requiring no battery but the selenium cell\r\nitself. The strength of the current varies with the amount of light on\r\nthe cell, and with the extent of the surface which is lighted.\r\n\r\nI produce current not only by exposure to sunlight, but also to dim\r\ndiffused daylight, to moonlight, and even to lamplight. I use this\r\ncurrent for actual working purposes, among others, for measuring the\r\nresistance of other selenium cells, with the usual Wheatstone's bridge\r\narrangement, and for telephonic and similar purposes. Its use for\r\nphotometric purposes and in current regulators will be mentioned further\r\non. It is undoubtedly available for all uses for which other battery\r\ncurrents are employed, and I regard it as the most constant, convenient,\r\nlasting, readily used, and easily managed pile or battery of which I have\r\nany knowledge. On the commercial scale, it could be produced very\r\ncheaply, and its use is attended by no expense, inasmuch as no liquids or\r\nchemicals are used, the whole cell being of solid metal with a glass in\r\nfront, for protection against moisture and dust. It can be transported or\r\ncarried around as easily and safely as an electro-magnet, and as easily\r\nconnected in a circuit for use wherever required. The current, if not\r\nwanted immediately, can either be \"stored\" where produced, in storage\r\nbatteries of improved construction devised by me, or transmitted over\r\nsuitable conductors to a distance, and there used, or stored as usual\r\ntill required.\r\n\r\n7. _Singing and speaking cells_.--When a current of electricity flowing\r\nthrough one of my selenium cells is rapidly interrupted, a sound is given\r\nout by the cell, and that sound is the tone having the same number of air\r\nvibrations per second as the number of interruptions in the current. The\r\nstrength of the sound appears to be independent of the direction of the\r\ncurrent through the cell. It is produced on the face of the cell, no\r\nsound being audible from the back of the cell. An alternating current\r\nalso produces a sound corresponding to the number of changes of\r\ndirection. Experiments also show that, if a telephonically undulating\r\ncurrent is passed through the cell, it will give out the speech or other\r\nsound corresponding to the undulations of the current--and, furthermore,\r\nthat the cell will sing or speak in like manner, without the use of a\r\ncurrent, if a suitably varied light is thrown upon it while in closed\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nMy experiments having been devoted especially to those branches of the\r\nsubject which promised to be more immediately practically valuable, I\r\nhave not pursued this inquiry very far, and offer it for your\r\nconsideration as being not only interesting, but possibly worthy of full\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE PROPERTIES OF CELLS.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of different properties possessed by my cells, it might\r\nbe anticipated that the different combinations of those properties would\r\nresult in cells having every variety of action. This is found to be the\r\ncase. As a general rule, the cells are noteworthy in one respect only.\r\nThus, if a cell is extremely sensitive to light, it may not be specially\r\nremarkable in other respects. As a matter of fact, however, the cells\r\nmost sensitive to the light are also \"U B cells.\"\r\n\r\nThe property of sensitiveness to light is independent of the power to\r\ngenerate current by exposure to light--the best current-generating cells\r\nbeing only very moderately sensitive to light, and some of the most\r\nsensitive cells generate scarcely any current at all. Current-generating\r\ncells are, almost without exception, \"U B cells;\" and the best\r\ncurrent-generating cells are strongly polarized, showing a considerable\r\nchange of resistance by reversing the direction of a current through\r\nthem; and they are also strong \"anode cells,\" i.e., the surface next to\r\nthe gold offers a higher resistance to a battery current than the other\r\nsurface of the selenium does. The power to generate a current is\r\ntemporarily weakened by sending a battery current through the cell while\r\nexposed to light, in either direction. The current generated by exposure\r\nto light is also weakened by warming the cell, unless the cell is\r\narranged for producing current by exposure to heat.\r\n\r\nThe properties of sensitiveness to light and to change of battery power\r\nare independent of each other, as I have cells which are sensitive to\r\nchange of current but absolutely insensitive to light--their resistance\r\nremaining exactly the same whether the cells are in darkness or in\r\nsunlight. I also have cells which are sensitive to light, but are\r\nunaffected by change of battery power, or by reversing the direction of\r\nthe current through them.\r\n\r\nThe sensitiveness to change of battery power is also independent of the\r\nsensitiveness to reversal of direction of the current. Among the best \"L\r\nB cells,\" some are \"anode cells\" and others are \"cathode cells,\" while\r\nstill others are absolutely insensitive to reversal of current or to the\r\naction of light.\r\n\r\n_Constancy of the resistance_.--A noticeable point in my cells is the\r\nremarkable constancy of the resistance in sunlight. Allowing for\r\ndifferences in the temperature, the currents, and the light, at different\r\ntimes, the resistance of a cell in sunlight will remain practically\r\nconstant during months of use and experiments, although during that time\r\nthe treatments received may have varied the resistance in dark hundreds\r\nof thousands of ohms--sometimes carrying it up, and at others carrying it\r\ndown again, perhaps scores of times, until it is \"matured,\" or reaches\r\nthe condition in which its resistance becomes constant.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the sensitiveness of a cell to light is\r\nincreased by proper usage. This increased sensitiveness is shown, not by\r\na lowered resistance in light, but by an increased resistance in dark.\r\nThis change in the cells goes on, more or less rapidly, according as it\r\nis retarded or favored by the treatment it receives, until a maximum is\r\nreached, after which the resistance remains practically constant in both\r\nlight and dark, and the cell is then \"matured,\" or finished. The\r\nresistance in dark may now be 50 or even 100 times as high as when the\r\ncell was first made, yet, whenever exposed to sunlight it promptly shows\r\nthe same resistance that it did in the beginning. The various treatments,\r\nand even accidents, through which it has passed in the mean time, seem\r\nnot to have stirred its molecular arrangement under the action of light,\r\nbut to have expended their forces in modifying the positions which the\r\nmolecules must normally assume in darkness.\r\n\r\n_Practical applications_.--There are many peculiarities of action\r\noccasionally found, and the causes of such actions are not always\r\ndiscernible. In practice, I have been accustomed to find the\r\npeculiarities and weaknesses of each cell by trial, developing its\r\nstrongest properties and avoiding its weaknesses, until, when the cell is\r\nfinished, it has a definite and known character, and is fitted for\r\ncertain uses and a certain line of treatment, which should not be\r\ndeparted from, as it will be at the risk of temporarily disabling it. In\r\nconsequence of the time and labor expended in making cells, in the small\r\nway, testing, repairing damages done during experiments, etc., the cost\r\nof the cells now is unavoidably rather high. But if made in a commercial\r\nway, all this would be reduced to a system, and the cost would be small.\r\nI may say here that I do not make cells for sale.\r\n\r\nThe applications or uses for these cells are almost innumerable,\r\nembracing every branch of electrical science, especially telegraphy,\r\ntelephony, and electric lighting, but I refrain from naming them. I may\r\nbe permitted, however, to lay before you two applications, because they\r\nare of such general scientific interest. The first is my\r\n\r\n_Photometer_.--The light to be measured is caused to shine upon a\r\nphoto-electric current-generating cell, and the current thus produced\r\nflows through a galvano-metric coil in circuit, whose index indicates\r\nupon its scale the intensity of the light. The scale may be calibrated by\r\nmeans of standard candles, and the deflections of the index will then\r\ngive absolute readings showing the candle power of the light being\r\ntested. Or, the current produced by that light and that produced by the\r\nstandard candle may be compared, according to any of the known ways of\r\narranging and comparing different lights--the cell being lastly exposed\r\nalternately to the two lights, to see if the index gives exactly the same\r\ndeflection with each light.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement leaves untouched the old difficulty in photometry, that\r\narising from the different _colors_ of different lights. I propose to\r\nobviate that difficulty in the following manner. As is well known, gold\r\ntransmits the green rays, silver the blue rays, and so on; therefore, a\r\ncell faced with gold will be acted upon by the green rays, one faced with\r\nsilver by the blue rays, etc. Now, if we construct three cells (or any\r\nother number), so faced that the three, collectively, will be acted upon\r\nby all the colors, and arrange them around the light to be tested, at\r\nequal distances therefrom, each cell will produce a current corresponding\r\nto the colored rays suited to it, and all together will produce a current\r\ncorresponding to all the rays emitted by the light, no matter what the\r\nproportions of the different colors may be. The three currents may act\r\nupon the same index, but each should have its own coil, not only for the\r\nsake of being able to join or to isolate their influences upon the index,\r\nbut also to avoid the resistances of the other cells. If a solid\r\ntransparent conductor of electricity could be found which could be thick\r\nenough for practical use and yet would transmit all the rays perfectly,\r\ni.e., transmit white light unchanged, that would be still better. I have\r\nnot yet found a satisfactory conductor of that kind, but I think the plan\r\nstated will answer the same purpose. This portion of my system I have not\r\npractically tested, but it appears to me to give good promise of removing\r\nthe color stumbling-block, which has so long defied all efforts to remove\r\nit, and I therefore offer it for your consideration.\r\n\r\n_Photo-electric regulator_.--My regulator consists of a\r\ncurrent-generating cell arranged in front of a light, say an electric\r\nlamp, whose light represents the varying strength of the current which\r\nsupports it. The current produced in the cell by this light flows through\r\nan electro-magnetic apparatus by means of which mechanical movement is\r\nproduced, and this motion is utilized for changing resistances, actuating\r\na valve, rotating brushes, moving switches, levers, or other devices.\r\nThis has been constructed on a small scale, and operates well, and I\r\nthink it is destined to be largely used, as a most sensitive, simple, and\r\nperfect regulator for currents, lights, dynamos, motors, etc., etc.,\r\nwhether large or small.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would say that the investigation of the physical\r\nproperties of selenium still offers a rare opportunity for making very\r\nimportant discoveries. But candor compels me to add that whoever\r\nundertakes the work will find it neither an easy nor a short one. My own\r\nexperience would enable me to describe to you scores of curious\r\nexperiments and still more curious and suggestive results, but lack of\r\ntime prevents my giving more than this very incomplete outline of my\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY APPLIED TO THE MANUFACTURE OF VARNISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Müthel & Lütche, of Berlin, recommend the following process for\r\nthe manufacture of varnish: The oils are treated by gases or gaseous\r\nmixtures that have previously been submitted to the action of electric\r\ndischarges. The strongly oxidized oxygenated compounds that are formed\r\nunder such circumstances give rise, at a proper elevation of temperature,\r\nto compounds less rich in oxygen, and the oxygen that is set free acts\r\nupon the fatty acid that it is proposed to treat. A mixture of equal\r\nparts of chlorine and steam may be very advantageously employed, as well\r\nas anhydrous sulphuric acid and water, or oxygen, anhydrous sulphuric\r\nacid and protoxide of nitrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, protoxide\r\nof nitrogen and air, or oxygen, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus is shown in section in the accompanying engraving; a is a\r\nsteam-pipe running from the boiler to the motor. From this pipe branch\r\nconduits, b, that enter the vessels, B, in which the treatment is\r\neffected, and that run spirally through the oil. At the lower part of the\r\nvessel, B, there is tube wound into a flat spiral, and containing a large\r\nnumber of exceedingly small apertures.\r\n\r\nThe oxidizing apparatus is shown at p. The gaseous mixture enters through\r\nthe tube, n, traverses the apparatus, p, and enters the vessel, B,\r\nthrough the tubes, g and D. Fig. 2 gives the details of the oxidizing\r\napparatus, which consists of two concentric glass tubes, A and F,\r\nsoldered at x. A is closed beneath and held in a cylinder, C; F contains\r\na small aperture through which passes a tube, E. The gaseous mixture\r\nenters through the latter, traverses the annular space between the tubes,\r\nA and F, and then makes its exit through H, whence it goes to a similar\r\napparatus placed alongside of the other. The shaded parts of the\r\nengraving represent bodies that are good conductors of electricity and\r\nthat communicate with the two poles of any electrice source whatever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 1 AND 2.]\r\n\r\nThe operation is as follows: After opening the tube, e, linseed oil is\r\nintroduced into the vessel, B, until the latter is half full, and, after\r\nthis, e is closed and the worm, S, is allowed to raise the temperature to\r\nbetween 60° and 80°. Then the cock of the tube, d, which communicates\r\nwith an air pump, is opened, and the pressure is diminished to about 730\r\nmm. of mercury. At this moment the oxidizing apparatus are put in\r\ncommunication with an induction bobbin that is interposed in the circuit\r\nof a dynamo, while through the tube, n, there is made to enter a mixture\r\nof equal parts (in volume) of sulphurous acid, oxygen, and air. At the\r\nsame time, the cock of the tube, g, is opened, while the stirrer, T, is\r\nset in motion. In this way we obtain, in a much shorter time than by\r\nordinary processes, a very liquid, transparent varnish, which, when\r\nexposed to the air, quickly hardens. It is possible, with the same\r\nprocess, to employ a mixture (in volumes) of two parts of protoxide of\r\nnitrogen with one and a half parts of atmospheric air, or even protoxide\r\nof nitrogen alone.\r\n\r\nWhen it is judged that the operation is finished, the tube, g, is opened,\r\nthe stirrer is stopped, and the tube, c, is opened after d has been\r\nclosed. The steam then forces the varnish to pass through the tube, f,\r\nand traverse the washing apparatus, which is filled half full of water,\r\nthat is slightly ammoniacal, and is heated by a circulation of steam, S.\r\nFinally, the product, washed and free from every trace of acid is\r\ncollected upon making its exit from the tube, h.--_La Lumiere\r\nElectrique._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAGLO BROTHERS' TELEPHONE SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe borrow from the _Elektrotechnische Zeitung_ the following details in\r\nregard to the telephonic installations made by the Brothers Naglo at\r\nBerlin. Fig. 1 gives the general arrangement of a station, where J is an\r\ninductor set in motion through a winch, K, and a pair of friction\r\nrollers; W, a polarized call; U, an ordinary two-direction commutator; B,\r\na lightning protector; and L and T, the two terminals of the apparatus,\r\none of them connecting with the line and the other with the earth. The\r\ninteresting point of this system is the automatic communication which\r\noccurs when the inductor, J, is moved. At the same moment that the winch,\r\nK, is being moved, the disk, P, is carried from right to left and brought\r\ninto contact with the spring, f_{2}. As soon as the winch is left to\r\nitself a counter-spring forces the disk, P, to return to a contact with\r\nthe spring, f_{1}. Figs. 2 and 3 show the details of such communication.\r\nThe winch, K, is keyed to one of the extremities of a sleeve that carries\r\nthe disk, P, at its other extremity. This sleeve is fixed upon the axle\r\nof the first friction roller, that is to say, upon the axle that controls\r\nthe motion of the inductor, and is provided at the center with two\r\nhelicoidal grooves, e, at right angles with one another. In these grooves\r\nslides a tappet, n, connected with the axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the counter-spring at the left of the disk, P, the\r\nlatter constantly tends to occupy the position shown in Fig. 2, which is\r\nthat of rest. As soon as the winch, K, is revolved, whatever be the\r\ndirection of the motion, the axle can only be carried along when the\r\ntappet, n, has come to occupy the position shown in Fig. 3, that is to\r\nsay, when the disk has moved from right to left a distance corresponding\r\nto the fraction of the helix formed in the sleeve.\r\n\r\nThis stated, it is easy to understand the travel of the currents. Fig. 1\r\nshows the station at rest. The current that arrives through L passes\r\nthrough the lightning protector, the body of the commutator, U, the\r\nterminal, v, and the call, W, bifurcates at P, and is closed by the\r\nearth. The inductor is in circuit, but, as it is in derivation, upon a\r\nvery feeble resistance, v, nearly the whole of the current passes through\r\nthe latter. When it is the station that is calling, the call, W, is put\r\nin derivation upon the circuit, f_{2} p, h, so that the portion of the\r\ncircuit that passes through q W v is exceedingly feeble, and incapable of\r\noperating the bell of the post that is calling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 2 AND 3.]\r\n\r\nFinally, when the telephone is unhooked, the inductor, J, and the bell,\r\nW, are thrown out of circuit, and the telephone is interposed between d\r\nand i, that is, between L and T.--_La Lumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GERARD ELECTRIC LAMP.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Gerard incandescent lamp the carbons have the form of a V. They\r\nare obtained by agglomerating very finely powdered carbon, and passing it\r\nthrough a draw plate. At their extremity they are cemented together with\r\na small quantity of carbon paste, and their connection with the platinum\r\nconducting wires is effected by means of a cylinder of the same paste\r\nsurmounted by a cone. These couplings secure a good contact, and, by\r\ntheir dimensions, prevent the attachments from becoming hot and\r\nconsequently injuring the carbon at this point. The cone forms a\r\nconnection of decreasing section, and prevents the carbon from getting\r\nbroken during carriage.\r\n\r\nThis process of manufacture permits of obtaining lamps of all\r\nintensities, from 3 candles up. The following, according to Mr. Gerard,\r\nare the consumptions of energy in each size of lamp:\r\n\r\n             Candles.   Volts.   Amperes.\r\n   No. 0.      10         16       1.5\r\n    \"  1.      25         25       2\r\n    \"  2.      50         30       2.5\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GERARD'S INCANDESCENT LAMP.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these lamps require a relatively intense current\r\nwith much less fall of potential than the Swan, for example--this being\r\ndue to the diameter of the filament. But, what is an inconvenience as\r\nregards mounting, if we wish to supply them by ordinary machines (for\r\nthey must be mounted in series of 3 on each derived circuit if the\r\nmachine gives, as most frequently the case, 100 volts), is an advantage\r\nas regards the quality and steadiness of the light and the duration of\r\nthe lamps.\r\n\r\nThe part in which the energy is expended is homogeneous, as might be\r\nsupposed from the mode of manufacture, and as may be ascertained from a\r\nmicroscopical examination, and it is exempt from those variations in\r\ncomposition that are found in carbons of a vegetable nature, like the\r\nEdison. Besides, being of relatively large diameter, the lamp is capable\r\nof supporting a very great increase of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe process employed for fixing the lamps is as simple as can be. Each\r\nplatinum wire is soldered to a piece of copper that surrounds the base of\r\nthe lamp and that is fixed to the glass with a special cement. These two\r\narmatures intertwine, but at a sufficient distance apart to prevent\r\ncontact. They carry a longitudinal projection and an inflation that fit\r\nby hard friction into two copper springs connected electrically with the\r\ncircuit. It is only necessary to lift the lamp in order to remove it from\r\nthe support; and the contrary operation is just as easy.--_Le Genie\r\nCivil_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW REFLECTING GALVANOMETER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 1 shows an elevation of the instrument and a horizontal section of\r\nthe bobbins. Two pairs of bobbins, cc, cc, are so arranged that the axes\r\nof each pair are parallel and in the same vertical plane. Each pair is\r\nsupported by a vertical brass plate, and the two plates make an angle of\r\nabout 106° with each other, so that the planes containing the axes of the\r\nbobbins make an angle of about 74°. Two horseshoe magnets, m m, made of\r\n1/25 inch steel wire, are connected by a very light piece of aluminum and\r\nplaced at such a distance from each other that, on being suspended, the\r\ntwo branches of each of the magnets shall freely enter the respective\r\nbores of the two bobbins fixed upon the same plate, and, when the whole\r\nsystem is in equilibrium and the bobbins free from current, the two\r\nbranches of each of the magnets shall nearly coincide with the axes of\r\nsuch bores. The magnets are not plane, but are curved so as to form\r\nportions of a vertical cylinder whose axis coincides with the direction\r\nof the suspension wire, and to which the axes of the bobbins are tangent\r\nat their center, approximately to the points where the poles of the\r\nmagnets are situated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. GRAY'S GALVANOMETER.]\r\n\r\nThe needles have been given this form so that their extremities shall not\r\ntouch the sides of the bore during considerable deflections.\r\n\r\nIn the instrument which the inventors, Messrs. T. & A. Gray, used in\r\ntheir experiments upon the resistance of glass, the needles were arranged\r\nso that their poles of contrary name were opposite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe system of needles is suspended from the extremity of a screw, p,\r\nwhich passes into a nut, n, movable between two stationary pieces. On\r\nrevolving the nut, we cause the screw to rise or lower, along with the\r\nentire suspended part, without twisting the thread.\r\n\r\nThe four bobbins are grouped for tension, and have a total resistance of\r\n30,220 ohms. They contain 16,000 feet of No. 50 copper wire, forming\r\n62,939 revolutions, nearly equally divided between the four bobbins. When\r\na current is passing through the bobbins, the poles of one of the\r\nhorseshoe magnets are attracted toward the interior of the corresponding\r\nbobbins, while those of the other are repelled toward the exterior by the\r\ntwo other bobbins. We thus have a couple which tends to cause the system\r\nto revolve around the suspension axis. A mirror, which is fixed upon a\r\nvertical piece of aluminum, a, gives, in the usual manner, a reflected\r\nimage upon a scale, thus allowing the deflections to be read. A\r\ncompensating magnet, M, is supported by a vertical column fixed to the\r\ncase, above the needles. This magnet may be placed in the different\r\nazimuths by means of a tangential screw, t. The extremities of the bobbin\r\nwires are connected with three terminals, T, T¹, T², and the\r\ninstrument may, by a proper arrangement, became differential. These\r\nterminals, as well as the communicating wires, are insulated with\r\nebonite.\r\n\r\nThus arranged, the instrument is capable of making a deflection of one\r\ndivision of 1/50 inch upon a scale placed at a distance of a little more\r\nthan a yard, with the current produced by one daniell of 10 ohms. This is\r\na degree of sensitiveness that cannot be obtained with any of the astatic\r\ninstruments known up to the present. By regulating the needles properly,\r\na greater degree of sensitiveness may be attained, but then the duration\r\nof the needles' oscillation becomes too great. The sensitiveness of the\r\ninstrument is sufficiently great to allow it to be used in many cases,\r\neven with a moderate duration of oscillation.\r\n\r\nIn their experiments upon the resistance of glass, the inventors employed\r\nan instrument that was not arranged for giving great sensitiveness, and\r\none with which resistances of from 10^{4} to 10^{5} megohms could be\r\nmeasured by the use of a pile of 120 daniells.\r\n\r\nThe instrument can be given another form. The four bobbins may be\r\narranged symmetrically in the same plane, and the two horseshoe magnets\r\nbe supported by an S-shaped aluminum bar. The latter traverses the plate\r\nthat supports the bobbins, in such a way that one of the magnets enters\r\none of the bobbins that correspond to it on one side of the plate, and\r\nthe other on the other side, as shown in Fig. 2. The bobbins are so\r\nconnected that, when they are traversed by a current, both magnets are at\r\nthe same time attracted toward the interior or repelled toward the\r\nexterior of the bobbins. Such a form of the instrument has the advantage\r\nof being more easily constructed, while the regulation of the magnets\r\nwith respect to the bore of the bobbins is easier.\r\n\r\nThe chief advantage of the instrument results from the fact that, owing\r\nto the arrangement of the magnets and bobbins, a large portion of the\r\nwires of the latter is situated very near the poles of the magnets, and\r\nin a position very favorable for electro-magnetic action. The instrument\r\npresents no difficulties as regards construction, and costs no more than\r\nan ordinary one.\r\n\r\nWe might even arrange a single horseshoe magnet, or an S-shaped one,\r\nhorizontally, and employ but a single pair of bobbins, and thus have a\r\nnon-astatic apparatus based upon the same principle. But in astatic\r\ninstruments it is better to place the magnets in such a way that the two\r\nbranches shall be in the same vertical plane.\r\n\r\nWere the line that joins the two poles vertical, the system would be\r\nperfectly astatic in a uniform field, since each magnet in particular\r\nwould then be perfectly astatic. A pair of horseshoe magnets may thus be\r\nregulated in such a way as to form a perfectly astatic system in a\r\nuniform field and to preserve an almost invariable zero, this being\r\nsomething that it is very difficult to obtain with the ordinary\r\narrangement of needles, especially when a compensating magnet is used;\r\nfor, in such a case, one of the needles becomes more or less magnetized,\r\nwhile the other becomes demagnetized, according to the position of the\r\ncompensating magnet.--_La Lumiere Electrique_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTOLOGICAL METHODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA cat, dog, rabbit, or Guinea pig will furnish parts from which sections\r\ncan be cut for the study of histology. Whichever animal is selected\r\nshould be young and well developed. Put it under influence of chloroform,\r\nand open into the cavity of the chest; make an incision into the right\r\nventricle, and allow the animal to bleed to death; cut the trachea and\r\ninject the lungs with a solution of one and a half drachms of chromic\r\nacid in one quart of water, care being taken not to overdistend the lung.\r\nTie the severed end to prevent the escape of the fluid, and carefully\r\nremove the lung. It is a difficult thing to do this without rupturing it,\r\nbut with care and patience it can be done. Place the lungs in a solution\r\nof the same strength as used for injecting; after fifteen or twenty hours\r\nchange it to a fresh solution, and allow it to remain for about a month,\r\nand then change it to rectified spirits, in which it may remain until\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nCut the tongue into several transverse and longitudinal pieces, also the\r\nsmall intestines, and put them into a solution of fifteen and one-half\r\ngrains chromic acid, thirty grammes bichromate of potash, and three pints\r\nof water; change the solution the next day, and let them remain two weeks\r\nand then place in spirits. Cut longitudinal and transverse portions of\r\nthe stomach and large intestines, wash in a weak solution of salt and\r\nwater, and put them in the same solution as used for the lungs, and treat\r\nsimilarly.\r\n\r\nCut the kidneys longitudinally and transversely, and put them in a\r\nsolution of six and one-half drachms bichromate of potash, two and\r\none-half drachms sodium sulphate, one quart of water; change the solution\r\nthe next day, and at the end of four weeks transfer to alcohol. Wash the\r\ninner surface of the bladder with salt and water, and after cutting it\r\nlongitudinally and transversely, put the sections in a solution of three\r\ndrachms bichromate of potash in a quart of water. Cut the liver into\r\nsmall parts, and place in the same solution as used for the kidneys;\r\nchange the solution after a day, and let them remain four or five weeks,\r\nthen change to spirits. The spleen and portions of the thin abdominal\r\nmuscles may be placed in a solution of three drachms chromic acid to one\r\nquart of water, and transferred to alcohol after three or four weeks.\r\nCarefully remove an eye and divide it behind the crystalline lens, put\r\nthe posterior portion in a solution made by dissolving fifteen grs.\r\nchromic acid in five drachms water, and slowly adding five and one-half\r\nounces alcohol; change to spirits in two weeks. The lens should be put in\r\nthe same solution, but should remain a few days longer. Open the head,\r\nremove the brain, and place transverse and longitudinal sections of it\r\nin spirits for eighteen hours, then transfer to a solution of one drachm\r\nchromic acid in a quart of water, and let it remain until hard enough to\r\ncut. Place the uterus in a solution of one and one-half drachms chromic\r\nacid in one quart of water, change to a new solution the next day, and at\r\nthe end of a month transfer to alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe bones from one of the legs should be carefully cleaned of its\r\nmuscles, cut into several pieces, and placed in a solution of fifteen and\r\none-half grains chromic acid, one-half drachm nitric acid, and six ounces\r\nwater. Change the fluid frequently until the bones are sufficiently\r\nsoftened, and then change to alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Section cutting_ machines for cutting sections can be procured of the\r\ndealers, but a very simple and effective one can be easily made if one\r\ndoes not wish to go to the expense of buying an instrument.\r\n\r\nA strip of wood twelve or fourteen inches long and about two inches wide\r\nhas attached to its center a bridge-shaped piece of wood, a, Fig. 1. This\r\nis covered with a brass plate, c, pierced with a hole one-half of an inch\r\nin diameter. This hole extends through the wood, and is fitted with a\r\npiston. Two long narrow inclined planes of nearly equal inclination, b,\r\nb, grooved to slide on each other, are placed under the bridge; the lower\r\nis to be fastened to the board; the end of the piston rests on the upper\r\none. The object from which we desire to cut a section is placed in the\r\nhole, in the piston. If the upper plane be pushed in, the piston will be\r\nforced upward, and with it the object. As the inclination of the plane is\r\nvery gradual, the vertical motion will be very slight as compared with\r\nthe horizontal.\r\n\r\nWhen the object is raised a little above the brass plate, a keen edged\r\nrazor, thoroughly wet, is pushed over the hole, cutting the object. This\r\ngives the section a smooth surface, and even with the plate; now push the\r\nplane forward one-eighth to one-quarter of an inch, and cut again; this\r\nwill give a thin section of the object. The thickness of the section\r\ndepends, of course, on the distance the wedge is pushed.\r\n\r\nWith a little practice, much better sections can be cut by the hand than\r\nby any machine; this does not apply of course to large sections. A razor\r\nof good steel, with a blade thin and hard, are the most essential points\r\nin an instrument for hand cutting. For ordinary purposes it is not\r\nnecessary to have the blade ground flat on one side, although many prefer\r\nit. The knife should always be thoroughly wet, in order that the cut\r\ntissue may float over its surface. Water, alcohol or salt and water may\r\nbe used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\n_To out a section by hand_, hold the object between the thumb and first\r\ntwo fingers of the left hand, supporting the back of the knife by the\r\nforefinger. The knife is to be held firmly in the right hand, and in\r\ncutting should never be pushed, but drawn from heel to point obliquely\r\nthrough the tissue. The section should be removed from the knife by a\r\ncamel's hair brush.\r\n\r\nWhen the object is too small to hold, it is usually _embedded_ in some\r\nconvenient substance. A carrot is sometimes very useful for this purpose.\r\nA hole rather smaller than the object is cut out of the middle. Put\r\nwhatever is to be cut into this, and cut a thin section of the whole. The\r\ncarrot does not cling to either the knife or the section, and the knife\r\nis wetted at every slice by it.\r\n\r\nParaffin is the agent usually employed for embedding purposes. Melt it,\r\nand add a little lard to soften it; the addition of a little clove oil\r\nrenders it less adhesive.\r\n\r\nMelt the paraffin at as low a temperature as possible, and pour it into a\r\npaper cone. Dip the object into this and remove immediately; as soon as\r\nthe layer of paraffin surrounding it becomes hardened, replace it in the\r\nparaffin; this prevents overheating the tissues.\r\n\r\nWhere the tissues are too soft to be cut, they may be soaked in a\r\nsolution of gum arabic and dried; in this condition they can be readily\r\ncut, after which the gum can be dissolved off. This is an extremely\r\nuseful method for cutting the lung or other organs where an interstitial\r\nsupport is needed. For a very thin object, a cork fitting any kind of a\r\ntube is to be split, and the object placed between the two parts; the\r\ncork is then thrust into the tube, and a sufficient degree of firmness\r\nwill be obtained to allow cutting. The sections should always be\r\nmanipulated with camel's hair brushes.\r\n\r\nMuch practice will be required before dexterity is attained.\r\n\r\n_Methods of preserving the tissues_.--All water must be removed from the\r\ntissue, either by drying or by immersing it in rectified spirits, and\r\nthen in absolute alcohol, and the alcohol driven off by floating it upon\r\noil of clove or turpentine. The substances used to preserve the tissues\r\nare Canada balsam, Dammar balsam, glycerine, Farrant's solution,\r\npotassium acetate, spirits, naphtha, and creosote.\r\n\r\nThe section is to be floated on to the slide or placed in position with a\r\ncamel's hair brush. It should be spread out, and then examined under the\r\nmicroscope for the purpose of improving its position if necessary, or of\r\nremoving any foreign particles. A drop of the preserving medium is then\r\nplaced upon it, and another placed on the cover and allowed to spread\r\nout. The cover is then taken by a pair of pincers and inverted over the\r\nobject, and one edge brought to touch the slide at one part of its\r\nmargin. The cover is then gently lowered, and the whole space beneath the\r\ncover filled and the tissue completely saturated. If air bubbles show\r\nthemselves, raise the cover at one corner and deposit a further quantity\r\nof the medium.\r\n\r\nThe slide should be set aside for a few days. First, the excess of the\r\nmedium must be removed; if it is glycerine, much of it can be removed by\r\na piece of blotting paper, but the cover must not be touched, for it is\r\neasily displaced; that near the cover can be replaced by a camel's hair\r\nbrush. A narrow ring of glycerine jelly should be placed around the edge\r\nof the cover, to fix it before the cement is applied. When this has set,\r\na narrow strip of cement is to be put on, just slightly overlapping the\r\nedge of the cover and outside the margin of the jelly. Until it has been\r\nperfectly secured, a slide carrying glycerine must never be placed in an\r\ninclined position, as its cover will slide off.\r\n\r\n_Preservative media_.--Canada balsam may be prepared as follows: Place\r\nsome pure Canada balsam in a saucer, and cover with paper to exclude\r\ndust; dry it in an oven at a temperature of 150°; when it cools, it will\r\nbecome hard and crystalline. Dissolve this in benzole, and use in the\r\nsame way as glycerine.\r\n\r\nDammar is now used as a substitute for Canada balsam. By its use the\r\ntissues are rendered more transparent. To prepare it, dissolve one-half\r\nounce of Dammar rosin and one-half ounce of gum mastic in three ounces of\r\nbenzole, and filter. This may be used to mount unsoftened bone and tooth,\r\nhair, brain, and spinal column, and most tissues that have been hardened\r\nin alcohol or chromic acid, which require to have their transparency\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nGlycerine is not adapted for white fibrous tissue or blood vessels,\r\nunless they have been hardened in chromic acid, as it causes the white\r\nfibers to swell up and lose their normal features. Sections of liver,\r\nlung, skin, and alimentary canal show better in glycerine unless they\r\nhave been stained.\r\n\r\nFarrant's solution may be substituted for glycerine in many instances,\r\nbecause of its feebler tendency to render the tissues transparent. It\r\nconsists of equal parts of gum arabic, glycerine, and a saturated\r\nsolution of arsenious acid. In mounting preparations with this medium,\r\nthe covered object should be allowed to lie a day before the varnish is\r\napplied, so that the cover may be fixed, and thereby prevented from being\r\ndisplaced. Rectified spirits may be used for mounting softened bone and\r\ntooth, and naphtha and creosote are useful for preserving urinary casts.\r\n\r\nWhen the section is mounted in Canada or Dammar balsam, no cement is\r\nrequired, but for all other preservative media the margin of the cover\r\nmust be covered with cement. To do this, dry the edges of the cover\r\nthoroughly with bibulous paper, and paint a layer of gold size, allowing\r\nit to overlap the cover an eighth or sixteenth of an inch, then cover\r\nthis with white zinc cement.\r\n\r\n_Preparation for mounting the different tissues_.--To obtain a section of\r\nbone or tooth requires a grinding down of the tissue until it is so thin\r\nas to be transparent. A section should first be cut as thin as possible\r\nby a fine saw. It should be attached by the flattest side to a piece of\r\nglass, and then ground down by a grindstone or by very fine emery, on a\r\nperfectly flat piece of lead. When sufficiently thin and transparent,\r\nmount in rectified spirits or Dammar. Sections of the tongue may be made\r\nby embedding in paraffin, and mounted in Farrant's solution or glycerine.\r\n\r\nSections of the stomach may also be made by embedding in paraffin, but\r\nbetter ones can be made by freezing. Farrant's solution makes a good\r\nmounting.\r\n\r\nThe intestines also give a better section from freezing than by\r\nembedding, as the paraffin injures the villi; mount in the same medium as\r\nthe stomach.\r\n\r\nThe liver may be embedded in paraffin, and the section mounted in\r\nFarrant's solution or glycerine. The kidney may be treated in the same\r\nway. The cornea of the eye can be readily cut by embedding in paraffin,\r\nand the section may be mounted in Farrant's solution. The crystalline\r\nlens and retina may be treated similarly.\r\n\r\nThe brain and spinal cord should be embedded in paraffin or a carrot, and\r\nthe section mounted in Dammar. Sections of the uterus and ovaries are\r\nbest mounted in glycerine or Dammar. Sections of lung maybe made by\r\nembedding in gum or by freezing, and mounted in Farrant's solution.\r\n\r\nEvery slide should be of uniform size, and labeled. The usual size is 3×1\r\ninches, and should be of a good quality of glass, free from scratches or\r\nair holes. They may be labeled either by writing with a diamond, or a\r\nsmall piece of paper affixed to one end, on which is written what is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE HISTORY OF A NEW SEPTIC ORGANISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting in London, of the Royal Miscroscopical Society, Dr.\r\nDallinger gave his annual address to what was probably the largest\r\ngathering of Fellows ever assembled on a similar occasion. After briefly\r\nreferring to the increased interest lately manifested in the study of\r\nminute organisms, and recalling the characteristics of the doctrines of\r\nabiogenesis and biogenesis, he passed rapidly in review the results of\r\nthe observations of Tyndall, Huxley, and Pasteur as bearing upon these\r\nquestions, and called attention to the observations of Buchner as to the\r\ntransformation of _Bacillus anthracis_ and _Bacillus subtilis_, and _vice\r\nversa_, and referred with approval to Dr. Klein's criticisms thereon.\r\nHaving spoken of the desirability of careful and continuous study of this\r\nclass of organisms, and the importance of endeavoring to establish the\r\nrelation of the pathogenic form to the whole group, he said he should be\r\nbetter able to deal with the subject by recording a few ascertained facts\r\nrather than by making a more extended review, and he therefore devoted\r\nthe main part of his address to a description of \"the life history of a\r\nseptic organism hitherto unknown to science.\" In his observations of this\r\nform--extending over four years--he had the advantage of the highest\r\nquality of homogeneous lenses obtainable, ranging from one-tenth to\r\none-fiftieth of an inch, his chief reliance being placed upon a very\r\nperfect one thirty-fifth of an inch; and from the continuous nature of\r\nthe observations as well as the circumstances under which they were\r\ncarried on, dry lenses had for the most part to be employed. Having in\r\nhis possession a maceration of cod-fish in a fluid obtained from boiled\r\nrabbits, he found at the bottom of it, when in an almost exhausted\r\ncondition, a precipitate forming a slightly viscid mass, to which his\r\nattention was particularly directed. It was seen to contain a vast number\r\nof _Bacterium termo_, but on examination with a one-tenth inch objective\r\nshowed that it also contained a comparatively small number of intensely\r\nactive organisms--one being discovered in about eight or ten drops of the\r\nsediment. These measured 1-10,000 of an inch in length by 1-19,500 of an\r\ninch in breadth. The fluid had originally been kept at a temperature of\r\n90° to 95° F., and it was noticed that, when placed upon a cold stage\r\nunder the microscope, the movements of the organisms became, gradually\r\nslower, until at last they entirely ceased; the necessity, therefore,\r\narose for the use of a warm stage, and the very ingenious contrivance by\r\nwhich a continuous and even temperature was maintained within the\r\none-tenth of a degree was exhibited. The greatest difficulty in the\r\nmatter was, however, experienced in obtaining specimens for observation,\r\nin order to be able to trace them from their earliest to their latest\r\nstage. The President then explained, by means of an admirable series of\r\nillustrations projected upon a screen by the oxyhydrogen lantern, the\r\nlife history of the organism to which he had referred, exhibiting it\r\nfirst as a translucent, elliptic, spindle-shaped body, with six long and\r\ndelicate flagella, the various positions in which the five specimens were\r\ndrawn giving a very good idea of its peculiar porpoiselike movements.\r\n\r\nThe various positions which it assumed in making an attack upon a portion\r\nof decomposed matter were also shown, the movements quite fascinating the\r\nobserver by their rhythmical character. The supposed action of the\r\nflagella in the production of the movements observed was explained,\r\ndistinct evidence being afforded of a remarkable spiral motion, at least\r\nof those behind. The process of fission was illustrated in all its\r\nobserved stages from the first appearance of a construction to that of\r\nfinal and complete separation, the whole being performed within the space\r\nof eight or nine minutes. A description of the process of fusion from the\r\nsimple contact of two organisms to their entire absorption into each\r\nother followed, as well as their transformation into a granular mass,\r\nwhich gradually decreased in size in consequence of the dropping of a\r\ntrain of granules in it wake as it moved across the field. The\r\ndevelopment of these granules was traced from their minute semi-opaque\r\nand spherical form to that of the perfect flagellate organism first\r\nshown, the entire process being completed in about an hour. Experiments\r\nas to their thermal death-point showed that, while the adults could not\r\nbe killed by a temperature less than 146° F., the highest point endured\r\nby the germs was 190° F. Illustrations of a variety of other modes of\r\nfission discovered in previous researches on similar forms were given,\r\nshowing the mode of multiple division and a similar process in the case\r\nof an organism contained in an investing envelope. The President\r\nconcluded his address, which was listened to throughout with the greatest\r\nattention, by remarking that, though the processes could be seen and\r\ntheir progress traced, the _modus operandi_ was not traceable. Yet the\r\nobserver could not fail to be impressed with the perfect concurrent\r\nadaptation of these organisms to the circumstances of their being; they\r\nwere subject to no caprices, their life-cycles were as perfect as those\r\nof a crustacean or a bird, and while the action of the various processes\r\nwas certain, their rapidity of increase and the shortness of their life\r\nhistory were such that they afforded a splendid opportunity of testing\r\nthe correctness of the Darwinian law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWINTER AND THE INSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a number of years previous to 1878 we had in Pembroke but little or\r\nno severe cold, owing to the prevalence of southeast, south, west, and\r\nespecially southwest winds. In many places, fuchsias that were left in\r\nthe ground for the entire year had not been frozen to the root within the\r\nmemory of man. Some of these plants had grown to be trees five or six\r\nyards in height, and with a trunk the size of one's leg. Now, during the\r\nsame series of years, many insects that are common throughout the rest of\r\nGreat Britain did not cease to be rare with us, or rather were confined\r\nto certain circumscribed limits. Thus, the Noctuellae, with the exception\r\nof a few species abundant everywhere, were almost wanting, and I know of\r\nno other country where the dearth of common species of nocturnal\r\nbutterflies was so great. But during the winter of 1878 there supervened\r\na radical change. Persistent winds from the northwest, driving back the\r\ncurrents of warm air from the south, brought on an intense cold that\r\nfroze everything; or, when some variation occurred in them, clouds formed\r\nand dissolved into a rain that immediately froze, so that the large roads\r\nremained for weeks covered with a layer of rime from two to four inches\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREEN WOODPECKER SEARCHING FOR INSECTS.]\r\n\r\nThe winters of 1879 and 1880 were equally cold; we may even say that the\r\nlatter was the severest that had been experienced in fifty years. This\r\nyear the sea-sand, along with the ice and snow, formed a thick crust all\r\nalong the tide-line--this being something rarely seen along our coast.\r\nThe first of these three winters (1878-1879) killed all the arborescent\r\nveronicas and a few sumacs. As for the fuchsias and myrtles, they were\r\nfrozen down to the level of the soil.\r\n\r\nI now come to the effects of this severe cold upon the insects.\r\n\r\nThe Lepidoptera, which before were rare, became more and more common in\r\n1879, 1880, and 1881, and so much so that during the last named year they\r\nabounded; and species that had formerly been detected only at certain\r\nfavored points spread over the entire coast and into the interior of the\r\ncountry. The geometers appeared in numbers that were unheard of. But this\r\nchange was especially striking as regards the Noctuellae, in view of the\r\nprevious rarity of the individuals belonging to this family.\r\n\r\nWe have here an example of the direct relation of cause to effect,\r\nalthough I am not in a position to assert that the effect is always\r\nproduced in the same way. To me there is no question as to the fact that\r\nthe constitution of those insects which nature has accorded the faculty\r\nof liberating is strengthened, and that their chances of life are\r\nincreased, if the cold of winter is intense enough to plunge them into an\r\nabsolute rest, and is not unseasonably affected by warm, spring-like\r\ndays. It is certain that such cold is capable of contributing largely to\r\nthe multiplication of the individuals of such species as hibernate in the\r\negg state, and it also has a beneficent influence upon those species\r\nwhich, like the small social larvae, pass this season upon the earth\r\nenveloped in a silken envelope, or, like the larvae of the Noctuellae,\r\nbetween dead leaves or upon the ground itself.\r\n\r\nOn another hand, it cannot be doubted that mild winters greatly\r\ncontribute to the bringing about of a destruction of larvae and chrysalids\r\nin two ways: First, they favor the development of mould, which, as well\r\nknown, attacks the larvae of insects when these have been enfeebled by an\r\nexcess of rain or dampness; and second, they permit beasts of prey to\r\ncontinue to exercise their activity. Now, these latter are numerous.\r\nMoles, instead of burying themselves deeply, then continue to excavate\r\nnear the surface, and shrew mice are constantly in search of food. These\r\nsmall mammals, which abound in this district, destroy a large number of\r\nchrysalids of Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with birds. As soon as severe cold begins to prevail in\r\nthe north and east, they come in troops to the open fields and the\r\nsheltered slope of the hills of our district. But it is scarcely worth\r\nwhile to stop to tell of the skill and perseverance of these destroyer of\r\nlarvae. We may mention, the woodpecker, however, as a skillful searcher\r\nfor insects that lie hidden in places where the sun has melted the snow.\r\nThe carnivorous Coleoptera and the Forficulae are likewise generally in\r\nmotion during mild winters. Doubtless these last-named do not make very\r\nlarge inroads in the ranks of larvae and chrysalids every day; yet, having\r\nno other food, they destroy a goodly number of them. But I believe that\r\nthe devastations made in the army of insects by all these enemies united\r\ndo not equal those made by certain crustaceans--the wood lice.\r\n\r\nDuring mild winters these pests multiply, eat, and prosper out of bounds,\r\nand to such a point that, in a climate like ours, they become a true\r\nscourge that prevails everywhere, out of doors and within. Once in a\r\nplace, they begin to look for larvae and chrysalids, which they devour.\r\nThe severe cold seems to have destroyed a certain number of them, since\r\nthey are now not so numerous by far; and it has at least certainly put a\r\nstop to their devastations at an epoch when the larvae are more\r\nparticularly exposed to the attacks of their enemies. It is to this\r\ncause, as well as to the preceding, that I am led to attribute the\r\nextraordinary multiplication of so many species during the three last\r\nsummers, which were separated by severe winters. Last winter was mild,\r\nand there is therefore no reason to expect that there will be another\r\nmultiplication; but I hope that the harm done by such a season will be\r\nslight. It is the progressive multiplication of the destroyers, joined to\r\nthe correlative disappearance of the victims caused by a series of\r\ntemperate seasons, that is to be feared.\r\n\r\nIn support of the proposition that I maintain, I may mention still\r\nanother fact. While this district (Pembroke, Wales) is relatively poor in\r\nspecies whose larvae feed and hibernate in the open air a few species of\r\nNoctuellae, whose larvae live buried in the earth, are always abundant. The\r\ncountry is relatively rich in spices of _Tortrix_, which develop and\r\nhibernate in the stalks or roots of plants. It is also worthy of remark\r\nthat very few of our species seem to be incapable of enduring a severe\r\nwinter.--_C.G. Barret, in Science et Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILK WORM EGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProf. C.V. Riley, entomologist, announces that the Department of\r\nAgriculture, Washington, will purchase during the coming summer such\r\nquantities of silk worm eggs as may be deemed necessary for the\r\ndistribution that it is proposed to make for the season of 1886. So far\r\nas found practicable, the eggs will be purchased of American producers.\r\nThere are certain precautions, however, that must be taken to insure\r\npurchase. Eggs of improved races only (preferably of the French or\r\nItalian Yellow Races) will be bought, and the producer should send one or\r\ntwo samples of pierced cocoons with the eggs. In addition to this the\r\nproducer must conform to certain rules to be hereafter explained, so that\r\nan examination may be made that will serve to show the degree of purity\r\nof the eggs. No silk culturist should use his crop for the production of\r\neggs unless the worms have shown, until they began the spinning of their\r\ncocoons, every sign of perfect, robust health. Any indication of the\r\ndisease called _flacherie_, from which the worms so often die after the\r\nfourth moult and turn black from putrefaction, or of any other disease\r\nfrom which silk worms suffer, should be considered as ample reason for\r\nnot using the cocoons for the purpose in question. They should, on the\r\nother hand, be sold for the filature. If the worms have all the\r\nindications of health until the spinning period, then the cocoons may be\r\nused for the production of eggs. The following brief instructions will\r\nprove of service to those who which to secure sound eggs:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor each ounce of eggs to be produced, about three-quarters of a pound of\r\nfresh cocoons from the finest and firmest in the lot should be chosen.\r\nThese should be strung in sets upon a thread, care being taken not to\r\npierce the chrysalis, and the strings hung in a cool, darkened room. The\r\nmoths generally emerge from the cocoons early in the morning, and will be\r\nseen crawling about over these, the males being noticeable by their\r\nsmaller abdomens, more robust antennae, and by their greater activity. The\r\nmoths should be placed, regardless of sex, on a table, where they will\r\nsoon find their mates and couple. As soon as formed, the couples should\r\nbe removed to another table, that they may not be disturbed by the\r\nflutterings of the single moths.\r\n\r\nThere should be prepared for each ounce of eggs to be produced, about\r\none hundred small bags of fine muslin, made in the following manner: Cut\r\nthe cloth in pieces 3×6 inches. Then fold one end over so as to leave a\r\nsingle edge of about three-quarters of an inch, as shown in the\r\naccompanying cut. This should be sewn up into a bag with the upper end\r\nopen, and then turned inside out, so that the seams will cause the sides\r\nto bulge. Thus completed they are called \"cells.\" The cells should be\r\nstrung on a cord stretched across the room.\r\n\r\nThe moths couple as a rule about eight o'clock in the morning. About four\r\nin the afternoon they should be separated by taking them by the wings and\r\ndrawing them gently apart. Each female should now be placed by herself in\r\na cell, which is then closed by a pin as shown in the figure. Here she\r\nwill lay her eggs and in due time die. The males may as a rule be thrown\r\naway, but it is wise to keep a few of the more active ones, in case there\r\nshould be a superabundance of females the following day.\r\n\r\nWhen the females have finished laying their eggs, which operation\r\noccupies about thirty-six hours, they are ready to be shipped to this\r\noffice. The cells, with their inclosed moths and eggs, should be placed\r\nin a strong box of wood or tin, being packed in such a manner that they\r\nwill not be crushed, and mailed to the entomologist at the department. By\r\nusing the inclosed return penalty slip, payment of postage may be\r\navoided. The name of the sender should be placed in each box. The moths,\r\nas soon as received, will be examined microscopically, and the eggs of\r\nthose which are found to be free from disease will be weighed and paid\r\nfor at the rate of $2.50 per ounce of 25 grammes (about 6-7 of an ounce\r\navoirdupois). Silk culturists are advised not to attempt the production\r\nof eggs unless they are adepts at the industry, and have had at least one\r\nseason's experience. We would advise each person desiring to sell, to\r\nsend a sample first, with a statement of the quantity offered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Zintgraff of Bonn has taken a phonograph with him to Africa.

This\r\nmisunderstanding, no doubt, has arisen from the incomplete description of\r\nour method given in the _Nature_ (Jan. 15. p. 260) report of the\r\n_Proceedings_ of the Berlin Physical Society, which report was probably\r\nthe only source of information accessible to Prof. Mayer. We are led\r\ntherefore to give a short description of our method.\r\n\r\nLet H I K L represent a section of a cubical block of lead, about two\r\nmeters in the edge, and weighing 100,000 kilos. The balance, A B C, is\r\nplaced in the middle of the upper horizontal surface. It bears the\r\nscale-pans, D and E. Under these scale-pans the block is bored vertically\r\nthrough, and two other scale-pans, F and G, are suspended below the\r\nblock, attached to the balance by means of rods passing through these\r\nopenings.\r\n\r\nA weight D is brought into equilibrium by weights in G. The weight in D\r\nis acted upon by the earth's attraction + that of the block, and that in\r\nG by the earth's attraction - that of the block. The weights in G are then\r\ngreater than that in D by twice the attraction of the block. The weight\r\nin D in now removed to F, and counterbalanced by weights in E. The weight\r\nin E will be less than that in F by twice the attraction of the block.\r\nThe difference of the two weighings gives therefore four times the\r\nattraction of the block. A correction must be introduced for the\r\nvariation in the earth's attraction due to the different heights of D, E\r\nand F, G.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain as great a deflection of the balance by the method\r\nsuggested by Prof. Mayer, each of the mercury spheres must exert the same\r\nattraction as our lead block. This would require spheres having radii of\r\nabout one meter. The length of the beam of the balance would be\r\nnecessarily at least two meters. Besides, each mass of mercury, would\r\nexert some attraction on the weight on the other side, and thus lessen\r\nthe deviation of the balance.\r\n\r\nThe method given by Prof. Mayer, except for the suggested employment of\r\nmercury, is then no improvement on ours. If we should use mercury, we\r\nwould construct a cubical vessel to contain it, and use it as we propose\r\nto use the lead block. The advantage of using mercury is, however,\r\ncounterbalanced by the difficulty of obtaining it in such large\r\nquantities as would be necessary.\r\n\r\nARTHUR KONIG.\r\n\r\nFRANZ RICHARZ.\r\n\r\nBerlin, Physical Institute of the University, March 15.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS WITHOUT APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Porosity and Permeability of Bodies._--Take two tumblers of the same\r\nsize, place one of them upon a table, and pour into it a small quantity\r\nof nearly boiling water. Cover this glass with a sheet of cardboard, and\r\ninvert the other one upon it. This second tumbler must be previously\r\nwiped so as to have it perfectly dry and transparent. In a few seconds\r\nthe steam from the lower tumbler will traverse the cardboard (which will\r\nthus exhibit its permeability), and will gradually fill the upper\r\ntumbler, and condense and run down its sides. Wood and cloth may be\r\nexperimented with in succession, and will give the same results; but\r\nthere are other substances that are _impermeable_, and will not allow\r\nthemselves to be traversed. Such, for example, is the vulcanized rubber\r\nof which waterproofs are made. This experiment explains to us why fog\r\nis, as has been well said, so _penetrating_. It traverses the tissue of\r\nour overcoat and of our flannel, and comes into contact with our body. On\r\nthe contrary, a rubber coat preserves us against its action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--EXPERIMENT UPON THE PERMEABILITY OF BODIES.]\r\n\r\n_A Hot Air Balloon_.--Make a hollow cylinder of small diameter out of a\r\nsheet of paper such as is used for cigarette packages, and turn in the\r\nends slightly so that it shall preserve its form.

Prince Florestan sold in 1860 his royal prerogatives to\r\nthe Emperor Napoleon, for three million francs, consequently the land\r\ncame under the jurisdiction of the French republic, but the city remained\r\nin the Prince's possession, who, however, gave to the gambler Blanc the\r\nprivilege of erecting a gambling house upon the rocky shore of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CASINO AT MONTE CARLO.]\r\n\r\nEnormous sums of money were spent to give this isolated cliff its present\r\nappearance, covered as it is with beautiful buildings, hotels, and\r\nvillas, besides the magnificent Casino building, which was erected in\r\n1862. Directly facing the sea, there is a succession of most beautiful\r\ngardens and terraces.\r\n\r\nBut this establishment, which seems like paradise, has had a most\r\ndisastrous effect upon thousands of persons, and for a long time the\r\nsubject of influencing the French government to put a stop to this\r\ngambling house has been agitated. It can scarcely be imagined how much\r\nmisery it has already caused. It is evident to every one that the keeper\r\nof the bank makes considerable profit, as the chances are 63 times\r\ngreater in his favor than those of the player.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the profits amount every year to 17 million francs.\r\nOne can well imagine how many fortunes have been consumed every year to\r\nmake this profit; but the number cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON AN EXPRESS ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a somewhat unpromising morning--the river is dark with fog and the\r\nhuge arch of the station nearly hidden by mist and steam. A cold, damp\r\nwind makes the passengers hurry into the carriages, and strikes us\r\nsharply as we step on to the foot-plate of the engine, which has just\r\njoined the train. But as we get behind the shelter of the screen, we feel\r\na generous and slightly unctuous sensation of warmth very comforting to a\r\nchilly man. The brasswork of the engine shines brilliantly, the footboard\r\nhas been newly scrubbed, and the driver and stoker stand waiting for the\r\nsignal. The needle shows that the steam is just below the pressure at\r\nwhich it would begin to blow off; the water in the gauge glass is just\r\nwhere it ought to be; in fact, the engine is in perfect condition and\r\nready for a start. The line is clear, the guard's whistle is answered by\r\nour own, and we glide almost imperceptibly past the last few yards of the\r\nplatform. The driver opens the regulator till he is answered by a few\r\nsounding puffs from the funnel, and then stands on the lookout for\r\nsignals so numerous that one wonders how he can tell which of the many\r\nwaving arms is raised or lowered for his guidance.\r\n\r\nSo he goes on, with hand on regulator and lever, gradually admitting more\r\nsteam as signal after signal comes nearer and then flies past us, till at\r\nlast we are clear of the suburbs and find ourselves on a gentle incline\r\nand a straight road, with the open fields on either side. It is now that\r\nthe real business of the journey begins. Locomotives are as sensitive and\r\nhave as many peculiarities as horses, and have to be as carefully studied\r\nif you would ride them fast and far. The lever is put into the most\r\nsuitable notch for working the steam expansively; the driver's hand is on\r\nthe regulator, not to be removed for the rest of the trip; the furnace\r\ndoor is thrown wide open, and firing begins in earnest. Here it may not\r\nbe amiss to state, for the benefit of the uninitiated, that the regulator\r\ncontrols the supply of steam from the boiler, while the lever enables the\r\ndriver to reverse the engine, or, as we have already stated, to expand\r\nthe steam by cutting it off before the end of the stroke. The engine\r\nanswers to the appeal like a living thing, and seems, with its steady\r\nbeat and sonorous blast, to settle down to its work. It is pleasant from\r\nour seat in the corner of the screen to see this preparation for the work\r\nahead--the absolute calm of driver and stoker, who exchange no word, but\r\ngo steadfastly and quietly about their business; to feel the vibrations\r\nfrom the rails beneath throb through one with slowly increasing rapidity,\r\nor watch the trees and houses go past as gulls flap past a boat. For\r\nthere is a certain apparent swagging movement of the objects past which\r\none travels which can only be likened to the peculiar flight of a large\r\nsea-bird. But now there are signs of increased activity on the\r\nfoot-plate; the stoker is busy controlling the feed of water to the\r\nboiler, and fires at more frequent intervals; the driver's hand moves\r\noftener as he coaxes and encourages the engine along the road, his\r\nslightest gesture betraying the utmost tension of eye and ear; the\r\nstations, instead of echoing a long sullen roar as we go through them,\r\nflash past us with a sudden rattle, and the engine surges down the line,\r\nthe train following with hot haste in its wake. We are in a cutting, and\r\nthe noise is deafening. Looking ahead, we see an apparently impenetrable\r\nwall before us. Suddenly the whistle is opened, and we are in one of the\r\nlongest tunnels in England. The effect produced is the opposite of that\r\nwith which we are familiar in a railway carriage, for the change is one\r\nfrom darkness to light rather than from light to darkness. The front of\r\nthe fire-box, foot-plate, and the tender, which had been rather hazily\r\nperceived in the whirl of surrounding objects, now strike sharply on the\r\neye, lit up by the blaze from the fire, while overhead we see a glorious\r\ncanopy of ruddy-glowing steam. The speed is great, and the flames in the\r\nfire-box boil up and form eddies like water at the doors of an opening\r\nlock. Far ahead we see a white speck, which increases in size till the\r\nfierce light from the fire pales, and we are once more in open day. The\r\nweather has lifted, the sky is gray, but there is no longer any\r\nappearance of mist. The hills on the horizon stand out sharply, and seem\r\nto keep pace with us as the miles slip past. The line is clear; but there\r\nis an important junction not far distant, and we slacken speed, to insure\r\na prompt pull-up should we find an adverse signal. The junction signals\r\nare soon sighted; neither caution nor danger is indicated, and, once\r\nclear of the station, we steam ahead as fast as ever. One peculiarity of\r\nthe view of the line ahead strikes us. Looking at a railroad line from a\r\nfield or neighboring highway, even where the rails are laid on a steep\r\nincline, the rise and fall of the road is not very strikingly apparent.\r\nSeen through the weather-glass, the track appears to be laid up hill and\r\ndown dale, like a path on the downs above high cliffs. Over it all we\r\nadvance, the engine laboring and puffing on one or two heavy gradients,\r\nin spite of a full supply of steam, or tearing down the inclines with\r\nhardly any, or none at all and the brake on. And here it may be noted\r\nthat, like modern men, modern engines have been put upon diet, and are\r\nnot allowed to indulge in so much victual as their forefathers. The\r\nengine-driver, like the doctor of the new school, is determined not to\r\nruin his patient by over-indulgence, and will tell you severely enough\r\nthat \"he will never be guilty of choking his engine with an over-supply\r\nof steam.\" In the mean time, the character of the country we travel\r\nthrough has changed. It has become more open, and there is a stiff\r\nsea-breeze, which makes itself distinctly felt through the rush of air\r\nproduced by the speed at which we are going. We fly past idle streams and\r\nponds, and as the steam swirls over them are disappointed at producing\r\nso little effect; but the ducks, their inhabitants, are well used to such\r\nvisitations, and hardly deign to move a feather. Suddenly we plunge into\r\na series of small chalk cuttings, and on emerging from them find\r\nourselves parallel with a grand line of downs. We speed by a curve or\r\ntwo, and find ourselves on the sea-shore; one more tunnel, and with steam\r\noff we go soberly into the last station. But there is one step more. The\r\nbreeze blows about our ears. Before us the rails are wet, for the sea\r\nswept over them not many hours since, and to accomplish the last few\r\nyards of our journey the lever controlling the sand-box must be used\r\nliberally, to prevent slipping; the signal is given, and at a walking\r\npace we make our way to where the steamer is awaiting us. A gentle\r\napplication of the brake pulls us up, and the journey is over. It is\r\ndifficult to realize, as the engine stands quietly under the lee of the\r\npier while the driver examines the machinery, and the fire, burned low,\r\nthrows out a gentle warmth as we stand before it, that half an hour ago\r\nwe were tearing along the line at full speed, while the foot-plate that\r\nis now so pleasant to lounge on throbbed beneath us. Nothing now remains\r\nbut to kill time as best we may till the return trip many hours hence. It\r\nscarcely promises to be as comfortable as our morning ride, for the\r\nweather has changed--it is blowing half a gale, and the rain comes down\r\nin sheets. Our train is timed to start in the small hours, and the night\r\nseems dirty and depressing enough as we make our way for a cup of coffee\r\nto the refreshment room, where a melancholy Italian sits in sad state\r\neating Bath buns and drinking brandy. We walk past the train, laden with\r\nmiserable sea-sick humanity, and step on the engine, which stands in the\r\ndark at the end of the platform. Time is up, and we pass from the dim\r\nhalf-light of the station into outer darkness. A blacker night there\r\ncould hardly be; looking ahead there is nothing to be seen but one's own\r\nreflection in the weather-glass. We are in the midst of obscurity, which\r\nsuddenly changes to a rich light as the whistle is opened and we enter a\r\ntunnel. The effect is far more striking than in the daytime. The light is\r\nmore concentrated, and the mouth of the tunnel we have just entered might\r\nbe the entrance to Hades--for there is no telltale spot of light to prove\r\nto our senses the existence of any opening at the other end. The sound\r\nechoed from the walls and roof has a tremendous quality, and resolves\r\nitself into a grand sort of Wagnerian rhythm, making a vast crescendo,\r\ntill with a rush we clear the tunnel, and are once more under the open\r\nsky. The pace is increasing, the steady beat of the engine tells more\r\ndistinctly on the ear than in the daytime; the foot-plate is lit up by\r\nthe glare from the fire-door; but still there is nothing to be seen ahead\r\nbut the impenetrable night. Looking back, however, the scene is very\r\ndifferent. The tender and guard's van glow in the light thrown by the\r\nfire, trees and houses by the side of the track stand out sharply for a\r\nmoment and are then lost to sight, the light from the carriage windows\r\nproduces the effect of the wake of a ship seen from the stern. Gradually\r\nthe clouds have rolled away, leaving the sky clear. The moon is seen\r\nfitfully through the whirling steam; the surrounding country is visible\r\nfor miles round. The effect produced is unspeakably beautiful. In the\r\nmean time let us turn our attention to the working of the engine. In the\r\nfirst place, let us take note that, although the engine we are now on,\r\nand that which took us from London, belong to the same type, their\r\nperformances are somewhat different. No two engines ever resemble each\r\nother, no matter how carefully they may have been built from the same\r\nplan, neither do any two drivers manage their engines precisely in the\r\nsame way. We have in this instance an excellent opportunity of comparing\r\ntwo different methods of driving. It is the driver's principal object to\r\nget the required amount of work out of his engine with the smallest\r\npossible expenditure of coal and water. To obtain this result the steam\r\nmust be worked expansively, which is done by placing the valve gear in\r\nsuch a position by means of the lever that the supply of steam to the\r\ncylinders is cut off, as we have stated at the beginning of this article,\r\nbefore the piston has accomplished its full stroke. There are two ways of\r\ncontrolling the speed of an engine worked, as all locomotives are worked\r\nnow, expansively. You may keep the regulator wide open, so that there is\r\nalways a full supply of steam on its way to the cylinders, in which case\r\nyou increase or diminish the speed by using the steam more or less\r\nexpansively through the agency of the lever. Or you may work with the\r\nsame amount of expansion throughout the journey, and have command of the\r\nengine by constantly changing the position of the regulator. There is no\r\ndoubt that the men who employ the latter method save something by it,\r\nalthough this would hardly seem to be the opinion of the driver who is\r\nbringing us rapidly nearer to London, for unlike the driver whom we\r\naccompanied on the daylight journey, his hand is not often on the\r\nregulator. As we rush on past countless signals, punctual to the minute,\r\nyet always having ample time to slacken speed before we come to the\r\nplaces where the different colored lights cluster thickest, we are\r\nreminded once more how much is required of an express engine-man besides\r\na thorough acquaintance with the machinery he has to control. Traveling\r\nat night at a great speed, he must know every inch of the road by\r\nheart--where an incline begins and where it ends, and the exact spot at\r\nwhich every signal along the line may be first sighted. He must have\r\ncompletely mastered the working of the traffic on both the up and down\r\nlines, and, above all, must be ready to act with the utmost promptitude\r\nshould anything go wrong. Mr. Michael Reynolds' publications have done\r\nmuch toward enlightening the public on these points, but we doubt if\r\nthere are many who really know the amount of toil and danger cheerfully\r\nfaced by the men on the engine, who hold their lives in their hands day\r\nafter day for many years. These thoughts occur to us as we recross the\r\nThames and pull up at the platform after a thoroughly enjoyable\r\nrun.--_Saturday Review_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mucilage on postage stamps may not be unhealthy, but persons having a\r\ngood many to affix to letter envelopes, circulars, newspapers, or other\r\nwrappers every day, will consume considerable gum during a year.

Squibb, A.B.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCA.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the principal markets of the world for this drug has\r\nrecently been exceptionally bad. That is, whether good coca was sought\r\nfor in the ports of Central and South America, or in London, Hamburg, or\r\nNew York, the search, even without limitation in price, was almost\r\ninvariably unsuccessful. Not that the drug, independent of quality, was\r\nscarce, for hundreds of bales were accessible at all times; but the\r\nquality was so poor as to be quite unfit for use. The samples, instead of\r\nbeing green and fragrant, were brown and odorless, or musty and\r\ndisagreeable, at once condemning the lots they represented, to the most\r\ncasual observation, and yet the price was high enough to have represented\r\na good article. The best that could be done by the most careful buyers\r\nwas to accept occasional parcels, the best of which were of very inferior\r\nquality, and therefore unfit for medicinal uses, and these at very high\r\nprices. Coca is well known to be a very sensitive and perishable drug,\r\nonly fit for its somewhat equivocal uses when fresh and green, and well\r\ncared for in packing and transportation. Very much like tea in this and\r\nother respects, it should be packed and transported with the same care\r\nand pains, in leaded chests, or in some equivalent package. It is very\r\nwell known that tea, if managed, transported, handled, and sold as coca\r\nis, would be nearly or quite worthless, and therefore coca managed as the\r\ngreat mass of it is must be nearly all of it comparatively worthless. If\r\nused as tea is, this would probably soon appear; but when used as a\r\nmedicine which has been highly extolled and well advertised, it seems to\r\ngo on equally well whether of good or bad quality. It is pretty safe to\r\nsay that nineteen-twentieths of the coca seen in this market within the\r\npast two years must be almost inert and valueless, yet all is sold and\r\nused, and its reputation as a therapeutic agent is pretty well kept up.\r\nAt least many thousands of pounds of the brown ill-smelling leaf, and of\r\npreparations made from it, are annually sold. And worse than this,\r\nconsiderable quantities of a handsome looking green leaf, well put up and\r\nwell taken care of, have been sold and used as coca, when wanting in\r\nnearly all its characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe writer for more than a year past has seen but one or two small lots\r\nof moderately good coca, and in common with other buyers has been obliged\r\nto buy the best that could be found to keep up his supply of the fluid\r\nextract. Almost every purchase has been made on mental protest, and he\r\nhas been ashamed of every pound of fluid extract sent out, from the\r\nknowledge that it was of poor quality; and there seems to be no more\r\nprospect of a supply of better quality than there was this time last\r\nyear, because so long as an inferior quality sells in such enormous\r\nquantities at good prices the demands of trade are satisfied.\r\n\r\nUnder this condition of the markets, the writer has finally decided to\r\ngive up making a fluid extract of coca, and has left it off his list,\r\nadopting a fluid extract of tea instead, as a superior substitute, for\r\nthose who may choose to use it, and regrets that this course was not\r\ntaken a year ago.\r\n\r\nThe character of coca as a therapeutic agent is not very good. The florid\r\nstories of a multitude of travelers and writers, up to and including the\r\ntestimony of Dr. Mantegazza, received a considerable support from so good\r\nan authority as Sir Robert Christison, who reported very definite results\r\nfrom trials made upon himself, and upon several students under his\r\nimmediate control and observation; and his results seem to have led to a\r\nvery careful and exhaustive series of observations at University College,\r\nLondon, by Mr. Dowdeswell. This paper, published in _The Lancet_ of April\r\n29 and May 6, 1876, pp. 631 and 664, is entitled \"The Coca Leaf:\r\nObservations on the Properties and Action of the Leaf of the Coca Plant\r\n(Erythroxylon coca), made in the Physiological Laboratory of University\r\nCollege, by G.F. Dowdeswell, B.A.\" The results of these investigations\r\nwere absolutely negative, and at the close of the work the investigator\r\nsays: \"Without asserting that it is positively inert, it is concluded\r\nfrom these experiments that its action is so slight as to preclude the\r\nidea of its having any value either therapeutically or popularly; and it\r\nis the belief of the writer, from observation upon the effect on the\r\npulse, etc., of tea, milk and water, and even plain water, hot, tepid,\r\nand cold, that such things may, at slightly different temperatures,\r\nproduce a more decided effect than even large doses of coca, if taken at\r\nabout the temperature of the body.\"\r\n\r\nConflicting and contradictory testimony from competent authority is not\r\nuncommon in therapeutics, and the reasons for it are well recognized in\r\nthe impossibility of an equality in the conditions and circumstances of\r\nthe investigations, and hence the general decision commonly reached is\r\nupon the principle of averages.\r\n\r\nThere can hardly be a reasonable doubt that coca, in common with tea and\r\ncoffee and other similar articles, has a refreshing, recuperative, and\r\nsustaining effect upon human beings, and when well cultivated, well\r\ncured, and well preserved, so as to reach its uses of good quality and in\r\ngood condition, it is at least equal to good tea, and available for\r\nimportant therapeutic uses. Mr. Dowdeswell supposed that he used good\r\ncoca, but it is very easy to see that with any amount of care and pains\r\nhe may have been mistaken in this. Had he but used the same parcel of\r\ncoca that Sir Robert Christison did, the results of the two observers\r\nwould be absolutely incomprehensible; and the results, in the absence of\r\nany testimony on that point, simply prove that the two observers were\r\nusing a different article, though under the same name, and possibly with\r\nthe same care in selection. On Sir Robert Christison's side of the\r\nquestion there are many competent observers whose testimony is spread\r\nover many years; while on Mr. Dowdeswell's side there are fewer\r\nobservers. But there has been no observer on either side whose researches\r\nhave been anything like so thorough, so extended, or so accurate as those\r\nof Mr. Dowdeswell. Indeed, no other account has been met with wherein the\r\nmodern methods of precision have been applied to the question at all; the\r\nother testimony being all rather loose and indefinite, often at second or\r\nthird hands, or from the narratives of more or less enthusiastic\r\ntravelers. But if Mr. Dowdeswell's results be accepted as being\r\nconclusive, the annual consumption of 40,000,000 pounds of coca at a cost\r\nof 10,000,000 dollars promotes this substance to take rank among the\r\nlarge economic blunders of the age.[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: An excellent summing up of the character and history of\r\ncoca, from which some of the writer's information has been obtained, will\r\nbe found in \"Medicinal Plants,\" by Bentley and Trimen, vol. i., article\r\n40.]\r\n\r\nThe testimony in regard to the effects of tea, coffee, Paraguay tea,\r\nGuarana and Kola nuts, is all of a similar character to that upon coca.\r\nEach of these substances seems to have come into use independently, in\r\nwidely separated countries, to produce the same effects, namely, to\r\nrefresh, renew, or sustain the physical and mental organism, and it was a\r\ncurious surprise to find, after they had all been thus long used, that\r\nalthough each came from a different natural order of plants, the same\r\nactive principle--namely, caffeine--could be extracted in different\r\nproportions from all. It is now still more curious, however, to find that\r\nfor centuries another plant, namely coca, yielding a different principle,\r\nhas been in use for similar purposes, the effects of which differ as\r\nlittle from those of tea, coffee, etc., as these do among themselves. Yet\r\ncocaine is chemically very different from caffeine, simply producing a\r\nsimilar physiological effect in much smaller doses. All these substances\r\nin their natural condition seem to be identical in their general\r\nphysiological effect, but idiosyncrasy, or different individual\r\nimpressibility or sensitiveness, causes a different action, as well in\r\nquality as in degree from the different substances, upon some persons.\r\n\r\nIn order to throw a little additional light on the comparative activity\r\nof the principal individuals of this group of substances, the following\r\ntrials were made. It is generally admitted, and is probably true, that\r\nthe same power in these agents which refreshes, recuperates, and sustains\r\nin the condition which needs or requires such effects also counteracts\r\nthe tendency to sleep, or produces wakefulness when a tendency to sleep\r\nexists; and, therefore, if a tendency or disposition to sleep could be\r\nprevented by these agents, this tendency might be used as a measure of\r\ntheir effects when used in varying quantities, and thus measure the\r\nagents against each other for dose or quantitative effect. In this way\r\nthe proposition is to first measure coca against tea, then coffee against\r\nguarana, and finally to compare the four agents, using pure caffeine as a\r\nkind of standard to measure by.\r\n\r\nAn opportunity for such trials occurred in a healthy individual\r\nsixty-five years old, not habituated to the use of either tea, coffee,\r\ntobacco, or any other narcotic substances, of good physical condition and\r\nregular habits, and not very susceptible or sensitive to the action of\r\nnervines or so-called anti-spasmodics. Quantities of preparations of\r\nvalerian, asafoetida, compound spirit of ether, etc., which would yield a\r\nprompt effect upon many individuals seem to have little or no effect upon\r\nhim, nor do moderate quantities of wines or spirits stimulate him. That\r\nis to say, he has not a very impressible nervous organization, is not\r\nimaginative, nor very liable to accept results on insufficient or partial\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nFully occupied with work, both physical and mental in due proportion, for\r\nmore than ten hours every secular day, when evening comes he finds\r\nhimself unable to read long on account of a drowsiness supposed to be of\r\na purely physiological character. With a full breakfast at about 7:30, a\r\nfull dinner at about 2:30, and a light evening meal about 7, and no\r\nstimulants, or tea, or coffee at any time, he finds, as a matter of not\r\ninvariable but general habit, that by half past 8 drowsiness becomes so\r\ndominant that it becomes almost impossible, and generally impracticable,\r\nto avoid falling asleep in his chair while attempting to read, even\r\nthough ordinary conversation be carried on around him.\r\n\r\nThe first trial to combat or prevent this drowsiness was made with\r\ncaffeine. The first specimen used was a very beautiful article made by\r\nMerck of Darmstadt, and after that by pure specimens made for the\r\npurpose, the two kinds being found identical in effect.\r\n\r\nCommencing with a one grain dose at about 6:30 P.M., on alternate\r\nevenings, leaving the intermediate evenings in order to be sure that the\r\nnightly tendency still persisted, and increasing by half a grain each\r\nalternate evening, no very definite effect was perceived, until the dose\r\nreached 2½ grains, and this dose simply rendered the tendency to sleep\r\nresistible by effort. After an interval of three evenings, with the\r\ntendency to sleep recurring with somewhat varying force each evening, a\r\ndose of 3 grains was taken, the maximum single dose of the German\r\nPharmacopoeia. This gave a comfortable evening of restedness, without\r\nsleep or any very strong tendency to it until ten o'clock. Without\r\nanything to counteract sleep, the rule was to read with difficulty by\r\nnine, without much comprehension by quarter past nine, and either be\r\nasleep or go to bed by half past nine. The 3 grain dose of caffeine\r\nrepeatedly obviated all this discomfort up to ten o'clock, but did not\r\nprevent the habitual, prompt, and sound sleep, from the time of going to\r\nbed till morning.\r\n\r\nThis was the model established, upon and by which to measure all the\r\nother agents, and they were never taken nearer than on alternate\r\nevenings, with occasional longer intervals, especially when the final\r\ndoses of record were to be taken.\r\n\r\nThe next agent tried in precisely this same way was coca; and knowing\r\nthat the quality of that which was attainable was very low, the\r\ncommencing dose of the leaf in substance was 2 drachms, or about 8\r\ngrammes. This gave no very definite effect, but 2½ drachms did give a\r\ndefinite effect, and a subsequent dose of 2½ fluid drachms of a well made\r\nfluid extract of coca gave about the same effect as 2½ grains of\r\ncaffeine. Three fluid drachms of the fluid extract were about equivalent\r\nto 3 grains of caffeine.\r\n\r\nBoth the coca used and the fluid extract were then assayed by the modern\r\nmethods, for the proportion of the alkaloid they contained.\r\n\r\nThe only assays of coca that could be found conveniently were those of\r\nDr. Albert Niemann, of Goslar, given in the _American Journal of\r\nPharmacy_, vol. xxxiii., p. 222, who obtained 0.25 per cent.; and of\r\nProf. Jno. M. Maisch, in the same volume of the same journal, p. 496, who\r\nobtained 4 grains of alkaloid from 1,500 grains of coca, which is also\r\nabout a quarter of one per cent. These assays were, however, very old,\r\nand made by the old process. The process used by the writer was the more\r\nmodern one of Dragendorff slightly modified. It was as follows:\r\n\r\nThirty grammes of powdered coca, thoroughly mixed in a mortar with 8\r\ngrammes of caustic magnesia, were stirred into 200 c.c. of boiling water,\r\nand the mixture boiled for ten minutes. The liquid was filtered off, and\r\nthe residue percolated with about 60 c.c. of water. It was then again\r\nstirred into 150 c.c. of boiling water, and was again boiled and\r\npercolated until apparently thoroughly exhausted. The total liquid,\r\namounting to more than 600 c.c., was evaporated on a water-bath,\r\ncommencing with the weaker portions, so that the stronger ones might be\r\nexposed to the heat for the shortest time, until reduced to about 20 c.c.\r\nThis liquid extract was transferred to a flask, and vigorously shaken\r\nwith 50 c.c. of strong ether. The ether was poured off, as closely as\r\npracticable, into a tared capsule, where it was allowed to evaporate\r\nspontaneously. A second and third portion of ether, each of 50 c.c., were\r\nused in the same way, and the whole evaporated to dryness in the capsule.\r\nA scanty, greenish, oily residue was left in the capsule, in which there\r\nwas no appearance of a crystallized alkaloid. The capsule and contents\r\nwere then weighed and the weight noted. The oily residue was then\r\nrepeatedly washed with small quantities of water, until the washings no\r\nlonger affected litmus-paper. The oily matter adhered to the capsule\r\nduring this process, no part of it coming off with the washing, and at\r\nthe end of the washing the capsule and contents were again dried and\r\nweighed, and the weight subtracted from the original weight. The\r\ndifference was taken as the alkaloid cocaine, and it amounted to 0.077\r\ngrm., equal to 0.26 per cent.\r\n\r\nSeveral preliminary assays were made in reaching this method. Some\r\nauthorities recommend the very finely powdered mixture of coca and\r\nmagnesia, or coca and lime, to be at once exhausted with ether. Others\r\nrecommend that the mixture be made into a paste with water, and after\r\ndrying on a water-bath that it be then exhausted with ether. This is\r\nbetter, but neither of these methods were satisfactory.\r\n\r\nFinally, 30 c.c. of a well made fluid extract of the same coca was\r\nthoroughly mixed with 8 grms. of caustic magnesia in a capsule, and the\r\nmixture dried on a water-bath and powdered. This powder was then\r\nexhausted, one part by ether and the other part by chloroform, exactly as\r\nin the method given, both parts giving very slightly higher results. As a\r\ncheck upon the results, the solution of alkaloid washed out was titrated\r\nwith normal solution of oxalic acid.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it would appear that this inferior coca of the markets, or\r\nrather the best that can be selected from it, yields about the same\r\nproportion of the alkaloid as was obtained by Niemann and Maisch, but it\r\nhas been shown that, by the older processes of assay used by them, much\r\nof the alkaloid was probably lost or destroyed, and that much better\r\nresults are generally obtained by the modern process.\r\n\r\nNow, since 3 drachms of this coca, or three fluid drachms of its fluid\r\nextract, gave the same physiological, or perhaps therapeutical, effect as\r\n3 grains of caffeine, and as the 3 drachms contained about 0.45 grain of\r\ncocaine, it follows that cocaine is about 6.5 times more effective than\r\ncaffeine; but it also follows that the coca accessible, and even the very\r\nbest coca, contains very much less of its alkaloid than those articles\r\nwhich yield caffeine do of that principle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MELLOCO.\r\n\r\n\r\nULLUCUS TUBEROSA.--Early last year two tubers of this plant were received\r\nat Kew from Caracas, and from out of doors in a prepared bed in June. The\r\nresult of this experiment, together with a few particulars as to the\r\nesculent properties of the tubers, may be worth recording, as I believe\r\nseveral gardeners, among them being the Messrs. Sutton, have obtained\r\ntubers of the Ullucus from Kew with a view to giving it a trial. The two\r\nCaracas tubers mentioned above were as large as hens' eggs, rather\r\nlonger, and somewhat flattened; the skin was red, as in some potatoes.\r\nThese, when placed in heat, rapidly developed shoots, which were removed\r\nas soon as they were strong enough to form cuttings; in this way about a\r\nhundred sturdy young plants were obtained and made ready for planting out\r\nof doors in June. They were planted in a light, sandy, well manured soil\r\nin a position exposed to full sunshine. Here they grew quickly, forming\r\nby the middle of August tufts of shoots and leaves one foot across. They\r\nwere earthed up as for potatoes, and the strongest shoots were pegged\r\ndown and partly covered with soil, though the latter proved unnecessary.\r\nAt this time there were no tubers nor any signs of them. On again\r\nexamining the plants in September (about the middle), we were surprised\r\nto find no tubers had yet been formed. The plants were now very strong,\r\nand it was therefore concluded that instead of forming tubers the\r\nstrength of the plants had \"run to leaves.\" We gave them up, no further\r\nnotice being taken of them till the frost came, when on perceiving that a\r\nfrost of four or five degrees did not injure the foliage, we again\r\nexamined the plants, and found an abundant crop of tubers just below the\r\nsurface of the soil, and varying in size from that of peas to pigeons'\r\neggs. The plants were left till the haulms had been destroyed by cold,\r\nafter which the tubers were gathered. On cooking some of the larger ones\r\nby boiling for half an hour, we found them still rather hard, and with a\r\nflavor of potatoes, almost concealed under a strong earthy taste, quite\r\ndisagreeable and soap-like. Considering how short a time these tubers had\r\nhad to grow in it is not improbable that their hardness and disagreeable\r\ntaste were owing to their being unripe; no doubt young, green potatoes\r\n(these Ullucus tubers were partly green) would be quite as nauseous as\r\nthese were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MELLOCO TUBERS.]\r\n\r\nWe are told that the Ullucus is extensively cultivated in Peru and\r\nBolivia, in the elevated regions where the common potato also thrives,\r\nand with which the Ullucus is equally popular as a tuber-yielding plant.\r\nIn the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ for 1848, p. 862, Mr. J.B. Pentland stated\r\nthat the Ullucus \"is planted in July or August, the seed employed being\r\ngenerally the smaller tubers, unfit for food, and is gathered in during\r\nthe last week of April. These two periods of the year are the spring and\r\nautumn in the southern hemisphere. The mode of cultivation is in drills,\r\ninto which the root is dropped, with a little manure. The climate, even\r\nduring the summer season, is severe, scarcely a night passing over\r\nwithout the streams being frozen over, the sky being in general cloudless\r\nat all periods of the year except during the rainy season (December to\r\nMarch). Mean temperature about 49°.\" This information seems to support\r\nthe view formed of this plant from its behavior at Kew last year, namely,\r\nthat the tubers are formed on the approach of cold weather, and that, so\r\nlong as the weather is warm and bright, leaves only are developed. Plants\r\ngrown in houses where the temperature has not been allowed to fall below\r\n50° in winter did not form any tubers, although they were in good health.\r\nWe found no tubers on the plants grown out of doors till some time after\r\nthe return of cold, wet weather. It seems likely that this plant does not\r\ndevelop tubers unless its existence is threatened by cold; at all events,\r\nsuch a conclusion seems reasonable from the above statements.\r\n\r\nPossibly a wet and rather cold autumn would be favorable to this plant\r\nand the production of its tubers--such a season, for instance, as would\r\nbe most unfavorable for the common potato. It would be worth while\r\ntesting the Ullucus for low and cold situations where the potato would\r\nnot thrive. There is not much probability of the former ever proving a\r\nsubstitute for or even a rival to the potato, at least in this country;\r\nbut there is room for another good esculent, and the Ullucus is prolific\r\nenough, hardy enough, and, we suppose, when properly grown, palatable\r\nenough to be worthy a trial. In the _Gardeners' Chronicle_ for 1848, p.\r\n828, will be found a most interesting detailed account of experiments\r\nmade with this plant in France by M. Louis Vilmorin.--_W.
