Pioneer 11’s trajectory, bent into a hairpin curve by\r\nJupiter’s powerful gravitational field, allowed it to recross the solar\r\nsystem to make the first flyby of Saturn almost a billion miles from\r\nEarth where it came within 13,300 miles of the cloud tops.\r\n\r\nAssembled in this publication is a selection of the pictures returned by\r\nPioneer 11 of Saturn and its largest moon, Titan. These images are of\r\ngreat beauty as well as of great scientific interest, serving to whet\r\nour appetite for the more detailed observations to be made by Voyager in\r\n1980 and 1981. Tracking of both Pioneers will continue for many more\r\nyears, providing fundamental data on the nature of interplanetary space\r\nin the depths of the solar system. The results of these outer-planet\r\nPioneer missions have far exceeded our hopes and expectations of a\r\ndecade ago when the program was initiated.\r\n\r\n  Robert A.

Missions undertaken\r\nduring the lunar exploration of the 1960’s typically lasted a matter of\r\ndays with commands issued and carried out in near real time. Now, a\r\ndecade later, planetary voyages may last for many years as the spiraling\r\ntrajectories of the spacecraft make periodic intersections with the\r\norbits of the planets. Communicating with us across the vastness of\r\nspace, these spacecraft report to us their experiences as they traverse\r\nthe outer reaches of the solar system.\r\n\r\nAmong these deep space travelers, Pioneers 10 and 11 are appropriately\r\nnamed, for they truly are pioneering the exploration of the outer solar\r\nsystem. Launched in 1972 and in 1973, respectively, they were the first\r\nspacecraft to fly by Jupiter (in 1973 and 1974). At Jupiter, Pioneer\r\n11’s trajectory was carefully targeted to swing it toward Saturn for an\r\nencounter in September 1979. We see some of the early results in this\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nOther spacecraft are following along the trail blazed by Pioneer Saturn.\r\nVoyager 1 passed by Jupiter in March 1979 and will reach Saturn in\r\nNovember 1980. Voyager 2 has also passed beyond Jupiter and will\r\nencounter Saturn in August 1981, with the further possibility of\r\ntraveling on to Uranus (a 1986 encounter). Under development are the\r\nGalileo orbiter and atmospheric entry probe, destined to journey to\r\nJupiter where the orbiter will return more detailed information,\r\nincluding high-resolution pictures of the Galilean satellites, and the\r\nprobe will penetrate deep below the Jovian clouds.\r\n\r\nIn the coming years, each of these follow-on missions will enrich our\r\nunderstanding of the solar system, greatly supplementing the\r\nobservations of Pioneers 10 and 11. But one thing will never change. The\r\nPioneers were first.\r\n\r\n  Thomas A.

The spacecraft began its\r\njourney to the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn on April 5, 1973, as\r\nPioneer 11. It reached Jupiter on December 2, 1974, passing within\r\n42,760 km of the Jovian cloud tops and taking the only existing pictures\r\nof Jupiter’s polar regions. Jupiter’s massive gravitational field was\r\nused to swing Pioneer 11 back across the solar system toward Saturn.\r\nAdditional maneuvers were executed in 1975 and 1976 to place the\r\nspacecraft on a suitable trajectory, with the final aimpoint selected in\r\n1977.\r\n\r\nFrom the many possible targeting options for the first Saturn flyby, two\r\naimpoints were considered, both of which would result in a\r\nnear-equatorial flyby that would give the best mapping of the\r\nhigh-energy particles and the magnetic field near the planet. The\r\ndifference between these two aimpoints, which came to be known as the\r\n“inside” and “outside” options, was their relationship to Saturn’s\r\nunique ring system first discovered by Galileo in 1610. The “outside”\r\noption was finally selected because it was considered to be of less risk\r\nto the spacecraft and more valuable in planning the subsequent encounter\r\nof Saturn by Voyager 2, which will reach Saturn in 1981. Final targeting\r\nwas completed during early 1978, when a series of timed rocket thrusts\r\nlocked Pioneer into the desired trajectory.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneer Saturn voyage.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Encounter trajectory.]\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 1979, the spacecraft, now designated Pioneer Saturn,\r\nreached Saturn after 6 years in flight. It passed through the ring plane\r\noutside the edge of Saturn’s A-ring and then swung in under the rings\r\nfrom 2,000 to 10,000 km below them. At the point of closest approach, it\r\nattained a speed of 114,100 km/h (71,900 mi/h) and came within 21,400 km\r\nof the planet’s cloud tops. While it was approaching, encountering, and\r\nleaving Saturn, the spacecraft took the first closeup pictures of the\r\nplanet, showing 20 to 30 times more detail than the best pictures taken\r\nfrom Earth, and made the first close measurements of its rings and\r\nseveral of its moons, including the largest moon, the planet-sized\r\nTitan. Titan, along with Mars, has been considered by many scientists to\r\nbe the most likely place to find life in the solar system.\r\n\r\nPioneer Saturn unraveled many mysteries. It determined that Saturn has a\r\nmagnetic field and trapped radiation belts, measured the mass of Saturn\r\nand some of its moons, and studied the character of Saturn’s interior.\r\nIt confirmed the presence and determined the magnitude of an internal\r\nheat source for Saturn. Its instruments studied the temperature\r\ndistribution, composition, and other properties of the clouds and\r\natmospheres of Saturn and Titan, and took photometric and polarization\r\nmeasurements of Iapetus, Rhea, Dione, and Tethys. Pioneer may also have\r\ndiscovered a previously unknown moon of Saturn. The spacecraft measured\r\nthe mass, structure, and other characteristics of Saturn’s rings, and\r\npassed safely through the outer E-ring, which posed a potential hazard\r\nfor Pioneer. It also discovered new rings. One of these rings, called\r\nthe F-ring by the Pioneer team, lies just outside the A-ring. The gap\r\nbetween the F-ring and the A-ring has been tentatively designated the\r\nPioneer Division. The other new ring has been called the G-ring, which\r\nlies well outside the F-ring.\r\n\r\nPioneer carries a scientific payload of 11 operating instruments;\r\nanother instrument, the asteroid/meteoroid detector, was turned off in\r\n1975. Two other experiments, celestial mechanics and S-band occultation\r\nof Saturn, use the spacecraft radio to obtain data. Pioneer Saturn is a\r\nspinning spacecraft, which gives its instruments a full-circle scan 7.8\r\ntimes a minute. It uses a nuclear source for electric power because the\r\nsunlight at Jupiter and beyond is too weak for a solar-powered system.\r\n\r\nTwo booms project from the spacecraft to deploy the nuclear power source\r\nabout 3 meters from the sensitive spacecraft instrumentation. A third\r\nboom positions the magnetometer sensor about 6 meters from the\r\nspacecraft. Six thrusters provide velocity, attitude, and spin-rate\r\ncontrol. A dish antenna is located along the spin axis and looks back at\r\nEarth throughout the mission, adjusting its view by changes in\r\nspacecraft attitude as the spacecraft and Earth move in their orbits\r\naround the sun.\r\n\r\nTracking facilities of NASA’s Deep Space Network, located at Goldstone,\r\nCalifornia, and in Spain and Australia, supported Pioneer Saturn during\r\ninterplanetary flight and encounter. Pioneer’s radio signals, traveling\r\nat the speed of light, took 85 minutes to reach Earth from Saturn, a\r\nround-trip time of almost 3 hours, somewhat complicating ground control\r\nof the spacecraft. Almost 10,000 commands were sent to the spacecraft in\r\nthe 2-week period before closest approach. Continued communications\r\nshould be possible through at least the mid 1980’s.\r\n\r\nAfter the spacecraft passed Saturn, it headed out of the solar system,\r\ntraveling in the direction the solar system moves with respect to the\r\nlocal stars in our galaxy and in approximately an opposite direction\r\nfrom its sister spacecraft, Pioneer 10. Both spacecraft have plaques\r\nattached to them which contain a message from Earth for any intelligent\r\nspecies that may intercept the spacecraft during their endless journeys\r\nthrough interstellar space.\r\n\r\n                  Pioneer Saturn Scientific Instruments\r\n      Instrument         Principal Investigator     Experiment Objective\r\n\r\n Helium vector        Edward J.

When Galileo first focused his\r\ntelescope on Saturn in 1610, he realized that the appearance of the\r\nplanet was unusual, but he never knew its real character because the\r\npower of his homemade telescope was far too low. He thought he was\r\nlooking at three globes, one large and two small, which seemed to change\r\nslowly in appearance. In 1655, Huygens, after years of observing the\r\nplanet, finally realized that these projections were actually a flat\r\nring slightly separated from the main globe.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: First sketch of Saturn (Galileo, 1610).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: First sketch showing a division in the rings\r\n    (Cassini, 1675).]\r\n\r\nIn 1675, Cassini found the first breach in the supposedly solid, rigid,\r\nand opaque ring when he discovered that it was divided into two parts by\r\na dark line, now known as Cassini’s Division. In later years he also\r\ndetected some of Saturn’s moons.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: First successful photograph of Saturn (Andrew Common,\r\n    1883). (Discovering the Universe, Colin A. Ronan, Copyright 1971 by\r\n    Colin A. Ronan, Basic Books, Inc., Publishers, New York.)]\r\n\r\nThe earliest successful photograph of Saturn was taken in 1883 by Andrew\r\nCommon. In 1895, James Keeler suggested that the rings are in fact a\r\nswarm of particles in near-independent orbits. These rings, until the\r\nrecent discoveries of faint ring systems around Jupiter and Uranus, were\r\nconsidered unique in the solar system.\r\n\r\nSince Galileo first used his homemade telescope to view Saturn, there\r\nhave been many observers. There have also been major advances in\r\ntelescopes; a resulting modern view of Saturn is shown on the next page.\r\nThe corresponding sketch shows the nomenclature of the brightest rings.\r\n\r\nNow the planet has been seen for the first time not from Earth, but in\r\nmuch closer views by an instrument on a spacecraft, the imaging\r\nphotopolarimeter on Pioneer Saturn. The instrument separately measures\r\nthe strengths of the red and blue components of sunlight scattered from\r\nthe clouds of Saturn and converts this information into numbers. The\r\ndata are transmitted to Earth as part of the spacecraft telemetry. The\r\nsignals are then converted by computer into shades of gray on\r\nphotographic film, and the two components plus a synthesized green image\r\ncan be recombined into a color image that approximates the planet’s true\r\ncolor. Some of the resulting images are shown on the pages following the\r\nEarth-based view. These pictures were produced by a scientific team from\r\nthe University of Arizona.\r\n\r\nThese images, while helping to unravel some of the mystery surrounding\r\nthe planet, have created even more interest regarding it. We are really\r\njust beginning to know Saturn. It is up to future spacecraft to more\r\ncompletely reveal her secrets and solve her mysteries.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: High-quality contemporary Earth-based view of Saturn\r\n    (Photo: Catalina Observatory, University of Arizona).]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Nomenclature of bright rings.]\r\n\r\n  OUTER (A) RING\r\n  CASSINI DIVISION\r\n  MIDDLE (B) RING\r\n  CREPE (C) RING\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneer Saturn image of Saturn and its rings from a\r\n    distance of 8,400,000 km (August 22, 1979, 10 days before closest\r\n    approach). Resolution has not yet reached Earth-based quality. Faint\r\n    banding is visible on the disk of the planet. The silhouette of the\r\n    rings can be seen in front of the planet. Slightly above this\r\n    silhouette is the shadow of the rings on the disk. Beyond the disk,\r\n    structure can be seen in the rings. The rings have a distinctly\r\n    different appearance in this and subsequent images than in\r\n    Earth-based pictures because they are illuminated from below rather\r\n    than from above as we view them from Earth. The A-ring and C-ring\r\n    are bright, and between them the B-ring is dark. The Cassini\r\n    Division at the inner edge of the A-ring is also bright, but is\r\n    blended with the ring at this distance.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneer Saturn image of Saturn and its rings from a\r\n    distance of 5,500,000 km (August 26, 1979, 6 days before closest\r\n    approach). Resolution of features is beginning to be approximately\r\n    equal to that of Earth-based pictures. Belts on the planet are\r\n    becoming more distinct, and considerable structure can be seen in\r\n    the rings. The small blue spot at the bottom of the planet is due to\r\n    incomplete data and will be corrected by further processing. A notch\r\n    appears at the top left of the planet, which may be a data\r\n    transmission problem or the shadow of one of Saturn’s moons.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneer Saturn image of Saturn and its rings from a\r\n    distance of 2,800,000 km (August 29, 1979, 72 hours before closest\r\n    approach). The Cassini Division at the inner edge of the A-ring is\r\n    clearly resolved and is bright. The A-ring is dark outside the\r\n    Cassini Division because it has more particulate matter there. Polar\r\n    belts are becoming more visible on the face of the planet.\r\n    Irregularities that appear in the ring silhouette and shadow are due\r\n    to stepping anomalies in the imaging photopolarimeter and will be\r\n    removed in further processing. The small round image that appears\r\n    above the planet is the moon Titan.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: These pictures of Saturn and its rings were taken by\r\n    Pioneer Saturn from a distance of 2,500,000 km (August 29, 1979, 58\r\n    hours before closest approach). The imaging photopolarimeter gathers\r\n    data using the red and blue components of the light reflected from\r\n    Saturn. These two views are from the two color components (upper,\r\n    blue; lower, red). The banded structure on the planet is\r\n    particularly evident in the upper image. Because the spacecraft is\r\n    nearing the planet, the rings are partially outside the field of\r\n    view of the instrument. The speck of light below the planet is\r\n    Saturn’s moon Rhea, which is 1450 km in diameter, about one-half the\r\n    size of Earth’s moon.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Saturn and its rings: red components.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: This image was produced by combining the two images\r\n    on the facing page, adding a synthesized green component, and\r\n    adjusting the intensity of each to obtain an approximation to\r\n    Saturn’s true color. (The same process was used in all of the\r\n    Pioneer color images of Saturn shown here.) Although not evident on\r\n    this reproduction, scientists believe that, from detailed study of\r\n    both the uncombined and the combined images, they can begin to see\r\n    evidence of jet streams in Saturn’s upper atmosphere. The slight\r\n    blue edge is an artifact from the computer-enhancement procedure.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Pioneer Saturn view showing the structure of Saturn’s\r\n    ring system in detail never before seen. The image was taken from a\r\n    distance of 943,000 km (August 31, 1979, about 44 hours before\r\n    encounter). The moon Tethys, seen at the top of the image, is 1200\r\n    km in diameter. There is a very faint unidentified Saturnian moon at\r\n    the lower right, just off the tip of the bright A-ring (may not be\r\n    visible in this print). The newly defined F-ring appears faintly\r\n    just outside the bright edge of the A-ring. The region between the\r\n    A-ring and the F-ring has been tentatively named the Pioneer\r\n    Division.

The blue dot at the outer edge of the C-ring is\r\n    an artifact. This image has not been computer processed to the same\r\n    extent as the facing image. Tethys, for example, is only faintly\r\n    visible, and the F-ring cannot be seen.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Close-up image from Pioneer Saturn of Saturn from a\r\n    distance of 400,000 km (September 1, 1979, a few hours before\r\n    closest approach).

The vertical stripe on the disk is\r\n    due to a gain change in the instrument. The image has not had its\r\n    final corrections for shape. The rings and their shadows cut\r\n    diagonal swaths across the image with the upper swath being the\r\n    shadow. The rings, seen from the unlit side, are visible in the\r\n    foreground. The ring shadow shows clearly that Saturn’s rings have\r\n    two major divisions: the Cassini Division dividing the outer A-ring\r\n    from the middle B-ring, and a second division (previously\r\n    controversial) dividing the B-ring from the inner C-ring. These\r\n    divisions show as parallel pinstripes in the broad black band of the\r\n    rings’ shadow, with the upper stripe being the Cassini Division.\r\n    Some shearing in the bands and belts on Saturn’s disk is beginning\r\n    to appear, although the low contrast on the planet (due to its\r\n    high-altitude haze) does not make this highly evident.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Post-encounter image of Saturn from a distance of\r\n    850,000 km (September 2, 1979, 15 hours after encounter). As\r\n    planned, during the encounter Saturn’s gravitational field turned\r\n    the spacecraft’s trajectory behind the planet and out toward the\r\n    edge of the solar system at approximately a right angle to the\r\n    inbound trajectory. Thus, the planet is now illuminated from the\r\n    side, and the view is of a crescent Saturn with the terminator on\r\n    the right of the picture. The rings appear dim when compared with\r\n    the previous inbound pictures because of the different angle between\r\n    the sun, the rings, and the spacecraft. When this picture was taken,\r\n    the spacecraft, as seen from Earth, was about to pass behind the\r\n    sun, and solar activity was interfering with spacecraft\r\n    communications. The image quality, therefore, is not as good as for\r\n    pictures taken inbound. With this farewell image from Pioneer,\r\n    Saturn waits for the Voyager spacecraft in 1980 and 1981.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: This image of cloud-covered Titan is one of the\r\n    “firsts” for the Pioneer Saturn mission. Titan is the largest of\r\n    Saturn’s moons. Because of its great distance from Earth, however,\r\n    Titan can be seen only as a point of light in Earth-based pictures.\r\n    The Pioneer trajectory could not be adjusted to allow passage close\r\n    to Titan, and imaging of the planet from the spacecraft was at the\r\n    outer range of capability of the imaging instrument. Thus, the fuzzy\r\n    edges and contrast variations on the moon should not be construed as\r\n    surface features.\r\n\r\n    Titan was imaged in the spirit of exploration and discovery. With\r\n    this image, which is now a part of recorded history, our visual\r\n    information on Titan is materially increased, but is still only\r\n    roughly equal to Galileo’s information on Saturn itself in 1610 at\r\n    the time that he prepared his first sketch. Better images of Titan\r\n    will be obtained by the Voyager spacecraft.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SCIENCE HIGHLIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nPioneer Saturn has already greatly expanded our knowledge of Saturn, its\r\nrings and moons. We now know that Saturn, in many ways, represents an\r\nintermediate case between Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar\r\nsystem, and Earth. The composition of Saturn’s interior is essentially\r\nthe same as Jupiter’s, differing only in the size and extent of the\r\nvarious internal layers. Measurements for Saturn are consistent with a\r\ncentral core of molten heavy elements (probably mostly iron) which is\r\nthe approximate size of the entire Earth, but about three times more\r\nmassive. Surrounding the central core is an outer core of highly\r\ncompressed hot, liquefied volatiles such as methane, ammonia, and water.\r\nThis outer core is equivalent to approximately nine Earth masses. These\r\ncore regions, however, represent a very small fraction of the planet,\r\nwhich is composed primarily of the very lightest gases, hydrogen and\r\nhelium, and is almost 100 times the mass of the Earth. Because of the\r\nhigh pressure in Saturn’s interior, the hydrogen is transformed to its\r\nliquid metallic state. Above this metallic hydrogen shell are liquid\r\nmolecular hydrogen and Saturn’s gaseous atmosphere and clouds, which\r\nmake up the rest of the planet.\r\n\r\nElectrical currents set up within the metallic hydrogen shell produce\r\nSaturn’s magnetic field, which was measured by Pioneer. In spite of\r\nSaturn’s large size, the magnetic field at the cloud tops is only\r\nslightly weaker than the field at the Earth’s surface. Saturn is unique\r\nin that its magnetic axis is nearly aligned with its rotation axis,\r\nunlike Earth and Jupiter.\r\n\r\nSaturn’s magnetic field is also much more regular in shape than the\r\nfields of the other planets. At large distances from Saturn, the\r\nmagnetic field is deformed by the inward pressure of the solar wind.\r\nNear the noon meridian (close to the inbound Pioneer trajectory), the\r\nsolar wind causes a compression of the field; in the dawn meridian\r\n(close to the outbound trajectory), the field is swept back and\r\npresumably forms a long magnetic tail. In both cases, Pioneer Saturn\r\ncrossed the outer boundary of the magnetic field several times as the\r\nfield moved in and out, responding to changing solar wind pressure.\r\nPioneer also observed inward and outward boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic envelope surrounding Saturn is intermediate in size and\r\nenergetic particle population between those of the Earth and Jupiter,\r\nthe only two other planets known to be strongly magnetized. The three\r\nother planets investigated thus far (Venus, Mars, and Mercury) and\r\nEarth’s moon have little or no magnetism. Virtually all our knowledge of\r\nSaturn’s magnetic environment has been obtained by Pioneer. The\r\nspacecraft found rings of particulate material and several small moons\r\nnear the rings, which strongly affect Saturn’s trapped radiation. These\r\nfeatures provide important diagnostic capabilities. A unique finding is\r\nthe nearly total absence of radiation belt particles at distances closer\r\nto the planet than the outer edge of the visible rings.\r\n\r\nThe inner region of the thick magnetic envelope of Saturn, called the\r\nmagnetosphere, contains trapped high-energy electrons and protons, with\r\nsome evidence for heavier nuclei. The overall form of the magnetosphere\r\nis simple and compact, more similar to that of Earth than of Jupiter.\r\nThe unique measuring capabilities of the Pioneer Saturn radiation\r\ndetectors led directly to the discovery of a diffuse new ring of\r\nparticulate matter in the region from about 10 to 15 planetary radii (1\r\nSaturn radius = 60,000 km) from Saturn. This ring has been tentatively\r\ndesignated as the G-ring. The G-ring clearly causes particle absorption\r\nnear the equatorial region. Moreover, Pioneer discovered another region\r\ninside 7 or 8 planetary radii in which the radiation belt particles were\r\nsubjected to a strong loss or absorption, presumably caused by the\r\npresence of an extensive cloud of plasma corotating with the planet.\r\n\r\nInside about 10 planetary radii, the trapped radiation shows a high\r\ndegree of axial symmetry around Saturn and is consistent with the\r\ncentered dipole magnetic field observed by Pioneer. Saturn’s rings\r\nannihilate all trapped radiation at the outer edge of the A-ring,\r\nleaving a shielded region close to the planet in which the radiation\r\nintensity is the lowest so far encountered in this mission. This\r\nshielding prevents the further buildup of electron intensities at lower\r\naltitudes, which otherwise would have been present and would have made\r\nSaturn a strong radio source observable from Earth.\r\n\r\nPioneer found that several of Saturn’s moons absorb trapped particles\r\nfrom the radiation belts, producing prominent dips in the intensity. The\r\neffectiveness of absorption at the moons Tethys and Enceladus is\r\nparticularly astonishing, and supports the idea that radiation belt\r\nparticles are drifting inward slowly across the moons’ orbits.\r\n\r\nA precipitous decrease in particle intensity, lasting only for about 12\r\nseconds, was observed over a wide range of energies for both protons and\r\nelectrons at a distance near 2.53 Saturn radii, 23 minutes after Pioneer\r\ncrossed the Saturn ring plane inbound. At about the same time, an\r\nanomaly was also observed in the magnetic field measurements. These\r\nphenomena have been tentatively interpreted as indicating the presence\r\nof a nearby massive body absorbing the trapped radiation and perturbing\r\nSaturn’s magnetic field. The estimated radius of this object lies in the\r\nrange of 100 to 300 km, based on the effectiveness with which it\r\nabsorbed the high-energy radiation. The total radiation dose received at\r\nSaturn was equivalent to only 2 minutes in the Jovian radiation belts\r\nbecause Saturn’s radiation belts were so much weaker.\r\n\r\nIn addition to images of Saturn, the brightness, color, and polarization\r\nof the reflected light were also measured by the imaging\r\nphotopolarimeter on Pioneer Saturn. These measurements are used to study\r\nthe cloud layers of Saturn and Titan and to model the vertical structure\r\nof the atmospheres of these two bodies. In the scans that made the\r\nimages, the banded structures of Saturn and of the rings were obtained\r\nin fine detail. These are essential in studying the atmosphere, rings,\r\nand moons. A new Saturnian ring, which has been tentatively designated\r\nthe F-ring, was discovered in the images. It is narrower than 500 km in\r\nwidth, but is important because it forms an outside barrier to the\r\nbright A- and B-rings. The gap between the F- and A-rings has been\r\ndesignated the Pioneer Division by the Pioneer team. A small moon, which\r\neither was previously unknown or had been previously discovered from\r\nEarth but lost again, was found in the Pioneer Saturn images. After its\r\ninitial discovery, this new moon continued on its 17-hour orbit around\r\nthe planet and passed near Pioneer as the spacecraft entered the ring\r\nsystem. It is quite conceivable that this moon is the same one that\r\nperturbed the radiation belt particles and produced the anomaly in the\r\nmagnetic field measurements.\r\n\r\nInfrared observations obtained during the Saturn flyby revealed the\r\ntemperatures in the atmospheres of Saturn and the rings and in the\r\natmosphere of Titan. It was found that Saturn has a temperature of about\r\n100 K (about 280°F below zero) and, according to these observations, has\r\nan internal heat source of enough strength that the planet emits\r\napproximately 2.5 times as much energy as it absorbs from the sun. The\r\nequatorial yellowish band observable in many of the images was found to\r\nbe several degrees colder than the planet at other latitudes and is\r\nprobably a zone of high clouds resembling similar zones on Jupiter. As\r\nexpected, the rings were extremely cold, 65 to 75 K (about 330°F below\r\nzero), at the time of encounter. The temperature differences between the\r\nilluminated and unilluminated sides of the rings, and the rate of\r\ncooling as the ring particles go into Saturn’s shadow, suggest that the\r\nring particles are at least several centimeters in diameter and the\r\nrings themselves are many particle diameters thick. The very minor\r\nperturbation to Pioneer’s trajectory, as it passed under the visible\r\nrings, indicates that the rings probably consist of ices.\r\n\r\nAs Pioneer passed through Saturn’s ring system, very sensitive meteoroid\r\ndetectors observed the impact of five particles on the spacecraft,\r\nparticles that were about 10 micrometers (0.0005 inch) in diameter. Two\r\nimpacts occurred while the spacecraft was above the rings and three\r\nwhile the spacecraft was below the rings. No impacts were detected going\r\nthrough the ring plane, but the Pioneer instrument cannot detect\r\nindividual impacts that occur less than 77 minutes apart. This\r\ncharacteristic would have prevented detection of ring particles because\r\nof the impacts detected just before both ring plane crossings. It is\r\nuncertain whether the micrometeoroids detected by Pioneer Saturn were\r\nstray ring particles deflected out of Saturn’s ring plane or whether\r\nthey were particles from interplanetary space drawn inward toward Saturn\r\nby its strong gravitational field.\r\n\r\nClose to the point of closest approach to Saturn, the spacecraft’s radio\r\ntransmissions were affected by Saturn’s ionosphere. The manner in which\r\nthe radio signals were absorbed indicates that Saturn has an extensive\r\nionosphere composed of ionized atomic hydrogen with a temperature of\r\nabout 1250 K in its upper regions. This high temperature requires an\r\nextensive energy source other than the sun. This phenomenon was also\r\nobserved at Jupiter.\r\n\r\nPioneer measured ultraviolet glow throughout the Saturnian system. This\r\nultraviolet glow is due to the scattering of the light from the sun by\r\natomic hydrogen. The observations of ultraviolet emission from an\r\nextensive cloud of hydrogen gas surrounding Saturn’s visible rings are\r\nespecially interesting. The rings themselves are presumably the source\r\nof this hydrogen. On the planet’s disk, the ultraviolet observations\r\nshow significant latitude variations, suggesting the possibility of\r\naurora near Saturn’s polar regions. A similar extensive cloud of\r\nhydrogen was also seen partially surrounding Titan’s orbit.\r\n\r\nThese very preliminary findings by Pioneer Saturn represent only a small\r\nfraction of what will ultimately be learned about Saturn and its\r\nenvironment as the spacecraft data are analyzed in greater detail over\r\nthe weeks and months ahead.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Schematic of the solar wind interaction with Saturn’s\r\n    magnetosphere.

Decreases in particle flux at the locations of Saturn’s\r\n    moons are due to the sweeping up of the energetic particles caused\r\n    by particles striking the moons and being absorbed by them. Also,\r\n    there are decreases in particle flux at the outer edge of the rings,\r\n    where the energetic particles are also absorbed, so that a region\r\n    free of trapped radiation is created from the outer edge of the\r\n    rings to Saturn.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Infrared radiometer image of Saturn and its rings.\r\n    Brightness in the image is related to temperature, with the\r\n    brightest areas at about 100 K (about -280°F).
