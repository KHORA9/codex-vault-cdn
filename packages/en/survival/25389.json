The\r\npurpose of this little book is to set down the things that we need to\r\nknow in order that we may make and keep our land friendly to plant life\r\nso far as lime is necessarily concerned with such an undertaking.\r\nIntelligent men like to reason matters out for themselves so far as\r\npracticable, taking the facts and testing them in their own thinking by\r\nsome truth they have gained in their own experience and observation, and\r\nthen their convictions stay by them and are acted upon. The whole story\r\nof the right use of lime on land is so simple and reasonable, when we\r\nstick only to the practical side, that we should easily escape the\r\nconfusion of thought that seems to stand in the way of action. The\r\nexperiment stations have been testing the value of lime applications to\r\nacid soils, and the government has been finding that the greater part\r\nof our farming lands is deficient in lime. Tens of thousands of farmers\r\nhave confirmed the results of the stations that the application of lime\r\nis essential to profitable crop production on their farms. The confusion\r\nis due to some results of the misuse of lime before the needs of soils\r\nwere understood, and to the variety of forms in which lime comes to us\r\nand the rather conflicting claims made for these various forms. It is\r\nunfortunate and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe soil is a great chemical laboratory, but exact knowledge of all its\r\nprocesses doubtless would enrich the farmer's vocabulary more than his\r\npocketbook. We are concerned in knowing that lime's field of usefulness\r\nis broad in that it is an essential plant food and provides the active\r\nmeans of keeping the feeding ground of plants in sanitary condition. We\r\nwant to know how it comes about that our soils are deficient in lime,\r\nand how we may determine the fact that they are deficient. We wish to\r\nknow the relative values of the various forms of lime and how we may\r\nchoose in the interest of our soil and our pocketbook. The time and\r\nmethod of application are important considerations to us. There are\r\nmany details of knowledge, it is true, and yet all fit into a rational\r\nscheme that shows itself to be simple enough when the facts arrange\r\nthemselves in an orderly way in our minds.\r\n\r\nLime cannot take the place of nitrogen, nor phosphorus, nor any other of\r\nthe essential plant foods. It is not a substitute for any other\r\nessential factor in plant growth. It would be folly to try to depend\r\nupon lime as a sole source of soil fertility. On the other hand, we have\r\nlearned very definitely within the last quarter of a century that it is\r\nfoolish to depend upon commercial fertilizers and tillage and good seeds\r\nfor full production of most crops from great areas of our farming\r\ncountry that have a marked lime deficiency. The obvious need of our\r\nsoils is the rich organic matter that clover and grass sods could\r\nfurnish, and their fundamental need is lime. Most farms cannot possibly\r\nmake full returns to their owners until the land's hunger for lime has\r\nbeen met. The only question is that regarding the best way of meeting\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE LIME IN SOILS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limestone Land._ Soil analyses are serviceable only within certain\r\nlimits, and in the case of the normal soils that comprise the very great\r\npart of the entire humid region of the United States the practical man\r\ngives little heed to what special analyses might show him when deciding\r\nupon the purchase of a farm. He does know, however, that a limestone\r\nsoil has great natural strength, and recovers from mistreatment more\r\nreadily than land low in lime. It has staying powers, and is dependable,\r\nunless through natural processes the lime leaches out or loses\r\navailability. All limestone areas have gained reputation for themselves\r\nas producers of grain and grass.\r\n\r\n_Other Calcareous Soils._ It is not only the limestone areas that stand\r\nhigh in esteem. There are types of soil with every varying percentage of\r\nlime down to clear sand or to peat, and some of the types are finely\r\ncalcareous, containing such a high percentage of lime that nothing more\r\ncould be desired.\r\n\r\nThe actual percentage is not the determining factor, a clay soil needing\r\ngreater richness in this material than a loam, and a sandy soil giving a\r\ngood account of itself with an even less total content of lime, but in\r\nits way the particular soil type must be well supplied by nature with\r\nlime if its trees and other vegetation bear evidences of its strength\r\nand good agricultural value.\r\n\r\n_Natural Deficiency._ It is interesting to note the differences in\r\nevidences of prosperity that are associated with lime percentages. The\r\nareas that are able to produce the vegetation characteristic of\r\ncalcareous soils are obviously the most prosperous. The decidedly\r\nlime-deficient sections, advertising their state by the kind of original\r\ntimber, and later by unfriendliness to the clovers, do not attract\r\nbuyers except through relatively low prices for farms. Such areas are\r\nextensive and have well marked boundaries in places.\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that every farm in such limestone valleys as the\r\nShenandoah, Cumberland, and Lebanon, or in the great corn belt having a\r\nnaturally calcareous soil, is prosperous, or that a multitude of owners\r\nof such lime-deficient areas as the belt in a portion of southern New\r\nYork and northern Pennsylvania, or the sandstone and shale regions of\r\nmany states, have not overmatched natural conditions with fine skill. We\r\ntreat only of averages when saying that a \"lime country\" shows a\r\nprosperity in its farm buildings and general appearance that does not\r\ncome naturally and easily to any lime-deficient territory. In the latter\r\na man rows against the current, and if livestock farming is not employed\r\nto furnish manure, and if the manure is not supplemented by tillage and\r\ndrainage to secure aeration, or if lime is not applied, the land reaches\r\nsuch a degree of acidity that it loses the power to yield any profit.\r\n\r\n_Nature's Short Supply._ The total area of lime-deficient soil is large,\r\ncomprising certainly much more than half of all the land east of the\r\nsemi-arid belt of the United States. No small part of this area was not\r\ndeficient at one time, as the nature of the original timber indicates,\r\nand it is well within the knowledge of practical men that land which\r\nonce produced the walnut and ash and shellbark hickory can be brought\r\nback to productivity with reasonable ease after very hard usage. It has\r\na good inheritance. It is a disconcerting fact in our American\r\nagriculture that, fertile as our country is as a whole, very great areas\r\nwere so deficient in lime before they came under man's control that the\r\nchestnut, pine, and the oaks of mean growth were fully at home. The\r\ngradation from low lime content to high, and its relation to soil type,\r\ngive us all sorts of mixtures of lime-loving and acid-resistant\r\nvarieties of trees in original forests, but our agriculture is hampered\r\nby the high percentage of land for which nature made no great provision\r\nof lime, and on this land farming lags.\r\n\r\n_Effect of Irrational Farming._ Interest in liming might well have been\r\ndue to the amendment of all this soil, but the rational use of lime that\r\nhas been the subject of much study in the last quarter of a century\r\nconcerns chiefly great areas that probably could have been kept in\r\nalkaline condition and friendly to the clovers for a long time despite a\r\nshort natural supply as compared with the content of our limestone\r\nlands. The success of individual farmers in areas now admittedly acid as\r\na whole is convincing on this point. Nature tries constantly to cure\r\nthe ills of her soil through the addition of vegetable matter. An excess\r\nof water or a deficiency is atoned for in a degree by the leaves and\r\nrotted wood of her forests. Aeration is kept possible. The lime in the\r\nproduct of the soil goes back to it. A system of farming that involves\r\nthe application of manure, thorough tillage, drainage where needed, and\r\nthe free use of sods in some way, has kept portions of these\r\nnon-calcareous soils out of the distinctly acid class. Clover grows\r\nsatisfactorily, grass sods are heavy, and there is no acute lime\r\nproblem. Such farms are relatively few in the great stretches of land\r\nnow classed as acid soil, and probably the most of the lime that is\r\nbeing applied goes only on ground that once was sufficiently alkaline to\r\ngrow the clovers. The loss of organic matter through failure to use the\r\nbest methods of farming is responsible for no small part of the\r\nwidespread need of lime today. This subtracts nothing from the urgency\r\nof its use to restore a condition favoring clover and grass sods, but it\r\ndoes teach a lesson of the highest value. The day of destructive soil\r\nacidity can be retarded by good farming, but in the long run the\r\ninevitable losses of lime from most soils must be met by applications.\r\n\r\n_Limestone Soils._ The old-time practice of making heavy applications of\r\nfresh burned lime to stiff limestone soils to make them friable, and to\r\nmake their plant food available, led to disuse of all lime in some\r\nsections on account of the exhaustion that followed dependence upon\r\nthese large amounts as a manure. Queerly enough, these original\r\nlimestone soils have latterly been going into the acid class through\r\nloss of their distinctive elements, and they, too, have become dependent\r\nupon means for the correction of acidity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSOUR SOILS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Loss of Lime._ Nature made the value of land as a producer of food\r\nutterly dependent upon the activity of lime, and at the same time gave\r\nit some power to shirk its work. In a normal soil is a percentage of\r\nlime that came from the disintegration of rock of the region or was\r\ntransported by action of water on a huge scale. Possibly rarely would it\r\nbe in insufficient amount to keep a soil in a condition friendly to\r\nplant life, and to feed the plant, if it stayed where nature placed it\r\nand kept in form available for the needs it was intended to meet. There\r\nis land that always was notably deficient in this material, and there is\r\nland that was known in the early history of the world's agriculture to\r\nbe \"sour,\" but the troubles of our present day in the case of the\r\nfarming country in the humid region of the United States is less due to\r\nany natural absolute shortage than to combination that destroys value\r\nand to escape by action of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clover and Timothy Unfertilized at the Pennsylvania\r\nExperiment Station Yielded 2460 Pounds per Acre]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clover and Timothy with Fertilizer alone at the\r\nPennsylvania Experiment Station Yielded 3900 Pounds per Acre]\r\n\r\n_Prevalence of Acidity._ The results of experiment station and farm\r\ntests are conclusive that the soils of the greater part of all the humid\r\nregion of the United States show lime deficiency. Formerly, acidity was\r\nassociated in our minds with wet, low-lying land, but within the last\r\ntwenty years we have learned that it prevails in light seashore sands\r\nalong the Atlantic shore, in clays, loams and shales stretching to the\r\nAppalachian system of mountains, on top of mountain ranges and across\r\nfoothills to our central states, and through them in stretches to the\r\nsemi-arid lands of the west. While not all this land has fallen into the\r\nlime-deficient class, and the great part of some states remains\r\nalkaline, the tendency toward acidity is continuous.\r\n\r\nCrop production in great portions of the Mississippi valley is\r\nrestricted by lack of lime in the soil, and some states to the eastward\r\nhave one-half to nine-tenths of their acreage too low in lime for the\r\nbest results. Calcareous soils have been losing their distinctive\r\nfeature, and the immense areas of land naturally low in lime have\r\nremained hampered in ability to make full returns for labor, fertilizer\r\nand seed. It is this situation that brings the right use of lime on\r\nland to the front as a matter of fundamental importance to the farmer.\r\n\r\n_Causes of Soil Acidity._ If any discussion of the causes of soil\r\nacidity would delay a decision to apply lime where needed, the time\r\ngiven to such discussion would be worse than wasted. It is much more\r\nimportant to be able to detect the presence of harmful acids and to\r\nneutralize them than it is to know why the soil should be in such plight\r\nthat it could not supply the required lime and had become dependent upon\r\nits owner for assistance. On the other hand, some of us find it\r\ndifficult to accept a fact without seeing a reason for it, and we may do\r\nwell to consider several causes that may be at work to put a soil out of\r\nthe alkaline class.\r\n\r\n_Leaching._ One cause that appears obvious and easy of acceptance is\r\nleaching. In the case of one Pennsylvania farm, lying in a limestone\r\nvalley, the lime had been washed out by action of water so freely that\r\ncaverns formed under the surface, and a test showed a marked deficiency\r\nin the top soil. This land ceased to grow clover, and plantain and\r\nsorrel abounded. This case, which is not an isolated one, showed an\r\nunusually rapid loss, but we always expect to find the water from wells\r\nand springs in a limestone country strongly impregnated with lime.\r\nDrainage waters contain it. The draft by action of water is continuous,\r\nand in some types could easily account for sufficient loss to change the\r\nnature of the soil. We may place undue emphasis upon this factor, as\r\nother causes are at work, but leaching is a leading source of loss.\r\n\r\n_Chemical Compounds._ A serious cause of lime exhaustion that is being\r\nstudied by soil chemists is the presence of compounds in the soil that\r\ncombine with the lime and rob it of ability to serve the soil when new\r\nacids form. The practical farmer accepts the statements of the chemists\r\non this point, and probably would not have his interests served by any\r\nexact knowledge of the nature of these agents.\r\n\r\n_Decaying Vegetation._ A cause of acid conditions that is widely known\r\nand accepted, and that may therefore stand out in our thinking with\r\nundue prominence, is connected with the decay of green vegetable matter\r\nin the soil. Many of us have seen fields rendered temporarily\r\nunproductive by the plowing down of a mass of immature plants in\r\nmidsummer. All organic matter, indeed, in its decay makes a draft upon\r\nthe lime content of the soil in which it may be buried.\r\n\r\n_Removal in Crops._ Lime is taken out of land by plants, and the loss is\r\na considerable item, but our interest is in the form of lime that can\r\ncorrect soil acidity, and we know that compounds of lime that are\r\nworthless for this purpose may be the chief source of the lime in our\r\ncrops. A determination of the lime in the ash of a crop does not give\r\ndata of much practical value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clover and Timothy with Lime Alone at the Pennsylvania\r\nExperiment Station Yielded 4900 Pounds per Acre]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clover and Timothy with Fertilizer and Lime at the\r\nPennsylvania Experiment Station Yielded 6290 Pounds per Acre]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEVIDENCES OF ACIDITY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Character of Vegetation._ The character of the original forests is\r\ndetermined much by the lime-content, and the practical man, when buying\r\na farm, rates its productive power by the kinds of timber it has\r\nproduced. The black walnut, ash, shellbark hickory, black and white oak,\r\nsturdily grown, evidence a soil rich in lime, while the pines, small\r\nblackjack and post oaks, and the chestnut are at home in non-calcareous\r\nsoils. The latter class of lands gains nothing in lime as time passes,\r\nand the timber continues to be a sure index, but in the former class the\r\nsurface soil may have lost enough lime to limit crop production\r\nmaterially while the trees continue to find in the subsoil all that they\r\nneed. It does not follow that the land has gone down in value to the\r\nnaturally lime-deficient class, but its power to produce is impaired,\r\nand will remain so until there has been restoration of its original\r\nalkaline state.\r\n\r\n_Sorrel and Plantain._ We determine quite surely the state of the soil\r\nby observance of the vegetation that roots in the surface soil and the\r\nimmediate subsoil. Sorrel is a plant popularly associated with soil\r\nacidity, but this is not through any dislike for lime. It has been\r\nobserved growing in the edge of a heap. Its presence suggests acidity\r\nbecause it can thrive in a sour soil that will not produce plants of\r\nvalue which on even terms could crowd the sorrel out. There is constant\r\ncompetition among plants for food and water and space, and some of our\r\nworst weeds are not strong competitors of clover and grass where soil\r\nconditions are not unfavorable to the latter.\r\n\r\nBlue grass, the clovers and timothy give a good account of themselves in\r\na contest with sorrel and plantain where lime is abundant. This does not\r\nmean that the seeds of these weeds may not be so numerous that an\r\napplication of lime cannot cause the clover and grasses immediately to\r\ntake the ground to the exclusion of other plants, but it is true that\r\nthe crowding process will continue until the time comes in the crop\r\nrotation that these weeds cease to be feared, and clean sods can be\r\nmade. It is the absence of lime that permits such weeds to maintain\r\ntheir reputation for good fighting qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Limed and Unlimed Ends of a Plot at the Ohio Experiment\r\nStation]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of Finely Pulverised Limestone on Clover in a Soil\r\nHaving a Lime Requirement of 5200 Pounds of Limestone per Acre at the\r\nPennsylvania Experiment Station]\r\n\r\n_The Clovers._ Red clover can make growth in some soils that have a lime\r\ndeficiency. If all other conditions are favorable, the lime requirement\r\nmay exceed one-half a ton per acre of fresh burned lime and not affect\r\nthe clover adversely, but farm experience throughout the country has\r\ndemonstrated that when soil acidity is only slight and clover grows with\r\ndifficulty, an application rarely fails to favor the clover in a marked\r\ndegree. Experience has taught the land owners to fear soil acidity when\r\nred clover does not thrive where formerly it made good growth.\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of alsike clover in a farming region is indicative of\r\nlack of lime. This clover thrives in a calcareous soil, but is more\r\nindifferent to a small lime supply than is the red clover. As red clover\r\nseedings begin to fail, the alsike gains in popularity, and where a soil\r\nis decidedly sour the alsike is most in evidence. The latter has less\r\nvalue to the farmer, rooting nearer the surface of the soil, and making\r\nless growth of top, but it has gained in favor with farmers as soil\r\nacidity has increased.\r\n\r\n_The Grasses._ Timothy is more resistant to acidity than red clover,\r\nbut often fails to make a heavy sod where the deficiency in lime is\r\nmarked. Rhode Island Bent, known as redtop, is less exacting, and where\r\nit thrives to the exclusion of timothy, or is in evidence in grass\r\nlands, the inference is fairly safe that a test would show that the soil\r\nis sour.\r\n\r\n_When Production Decreases._ It is not a matter of any moment to the\r\nowner of a productive soil whether or not his soil would give an acid or\r\nan alkaline reaction under test. Returns from his labor are\r\nsatisfactory. Some land in this class is not strictly alkaline. The man\r\nmost interested in the effects of lime applications is the one who is\r\nnot satisfied with yields. The tests for acidity have been so many\r\nthroughout our eastern and central states that the owner of land which\r\nis not productive has reason for the presumption that its percentage of\r\nlime is too low. There is danger of error, and a scientific test is\r\nsurer, but in most cases the land which has been reduced from a fertile\r\nto an unproductive state has lost its alkaline nature.\r\n\r\n_Naturally Thin Soils._ Nature may be prodigal in supplies of nearly all\r\nthe elements of plant food to land and yet skimp its supply of lime,\r\nbut naturally poor soils are quite surely in the acid class. The\r\nexceptions in our humid region are not extensive. When improvement is\r\nplanned for, involving additions of organic matter and plant food, the\r\napplication of lime to correct acidity is the first requirement. If such\r\nland could be given the characteristics of a limestone soil so far only\r\nas the lime factor is concerned, the building up of fertility would be\r\nrelatively easy. Liming must form the foundation of a new order of\r\nthings. The ability to grow the clovers and to furnish rich vegetable\r\nmatter to the soil, which naturally is poor in humus, rests upon lime\r\napplication first, and then upon any supply of plant food that may\r\ncontinue to be lacking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTESTS FOR ACIDITY\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Litmus Paper Test._ A method of testing soils for acidity, which\r\nhas been in use for many years, is the simple litmus paper method.\r\nBecause of its simplicity and fair degree of accuracy, the litmus paper\r\ntest is still used to a considerable extent in estimating the degree of\r\nacidity of certain soils. The best manner of using litmus is to place a\r\nstrip of the blue paper in the bottom of a glass saucer, covering it\r\nwith filter paper or other paper which is neutral--that is, paper which\r\nis neither acid nor alkaline.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of the soil to be tested is moistened with rain or\r\ndistilled water and placed on this paper. If the acid is present the\r\nblue paper will be changed to a reddish color, varying in intensity\r\naccording to the degree of acidity in the soil. Two objections to the\r\nuse of litmus paper are to be noted: One of these is that the red color\r\nmay be produced by carbonic acid gas without a trace of more powerful\r\nacids being present, and this may give a wrong impression to the\r\noperator. Another objection to the use of litmus is that the degree of\r\nacidity is not accurately indicated, and therefore the farmer is\r\nsometimes at a loss to know just how much lime should be applied to make\r\nsoil conditions favorable for growing crops.\r\n\r\n_A More Accurate Method._ Within the last few years improved methods for\r\ndetermining the presence of acidity in soil have been developed. Some of\r\nthese are suitable only for the chemist with his complete laboratory\r\nequipment, while others are more simple and can be used by anyone\r\nwilling to exercise reasonable care.\r\n\r\nOne of the simplest and most accurate tests to date is that devised by\r\nProfessor E. Truog of the agricultural experiment station of the\r\nUniversity of Wisconsin. This test not only detects positively the\r\npresence of soil acidity, but also gives definite information as to the\r\ndegree of acidity. The test is based upon the principle that when zinc\r\nsulfid comes in contact with the acid, hydrogen sulfid gas is formed,\r\nand when this gas comes in contact with lead acetate, lead sulfid, a\r\nblack chemical, is formed.\r\n\r\nThe method of making this test is simple, and consists in placing a\r\nmeasured quantity of soil in a flask, to which is added a solution\r\ncomposed of 20% calcium chlorid and 2% zinc sulfid. The mixture of soil\r\nand chemical solution is heated to the boiling point by means of an\r\nalcohol lamp, and the boiling continued for a minute for the purpose of\r\ndriving off the carbonic acid gas, which is liberated first. The boiling\r\nis continued and a piece of moistened paper, previously impregnated with\r\nlead acetate, is placed over the mouth of the flask. If the soil\r\ncontains acid, a chemical reaction occurs between it and zinc sulfid,\r\nand hydrogen sulfid gas is liberated. The quantity of acidity in the\r\nsoil determines the quantity of gas which comes in contact with the lead\r\nacetate paper, and this determines the depth of color produced on the\r\npaper. A slight brownish color indicates the presence of very little\r\nacidity, while an intense black signifies the presence of injurious\r\namounts of acidity. There are various degrees of coloration between\r\nthese two extremes, and each gives an accurate indication as to the\r\nquantity of lime required to correct the acidity.\r\n\r\nThis test is simple and inexpensive, and at the present time most county\r\nagent offices are equipped with this apparatus or a similar one for\r\ntesting soils for farmers. Some newer methods are being devised, and\r\ndoubtless this method will be improved upon as time passes, but the\r\nTruog test has qualities of accuracy and simplicity which will always\r\nmake it valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF LIME\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nature's Provision._ Soils are composed of pulverized stone and organic\r\nmatter. Much of the original stone contained little lime, and the human\r\nrace would become nearly helpless if there were no stores of supply in\r\nthe form of limestone, chalk, marl, etc. The day would come when the\r\nsurface soil could not produce our staple crops if its loss of lime\r\ncontinued, and a means of replenishing the stock were not at hand. The\r\nhuge deposits of limestone that have not been disintegrated by processes\r\nof weathering are assurance that the soil's need can be met forever. The\r\ncalcium and magnesium in the stone are in chemical combination with\r\ncarbonic acid forming carbonates, and there is an additional mixture of\r\nother earthy material that was deposited by the water when the stone was\r\nbeing formed, but much limestone possesses an excellent degree of\r\npurity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lime Favors Clover at the Ohio Experiment Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lime Affects Growth of Corn at the Ohio Experiment\r\nStation]\r\n\r\n_Confusion Respecting Forms._ In the public mind there is much confusion\r\nrespecting the sources and forms of lime most to be desired. Wood\r\nashes appealed to people, especially in an early day in our agriculture,\r\npartly because the ashes were so universally present that tests had been\r\nmade voluntarily and otherwise in millions of instances. The value of\r\nsuch tests had been obscured by the fact that the ashes contained\r\npotash, and much of the credit of any good effect was attributed to that\r\nfact. It has been generally known, however, that lime in peculiarly\r\neffective form is in wood ashes, and the favor in which ashes have been\r\nheld rested not a little upon the curious preference for an organic\r\nsource of all soil amendments. This is seen in the case of direct\r\nfertilizers.\r\n\r\n_Dealers' Interests._ The doubts regarding the wisdom of selecting any\r\none form of lime for the betterment of soil conditions have been\r\npromoted very naturally by the conflicting interests of men who would\r\nfurnish the supply. Some dealers in fresh burned lime have asserted that\r\nit was folly to expect any appreciable result from the use of unburned\r\nlimestone. The manufacturer of ground limestone has pointed out the\r\npossibility of injuring a soil by the use of caustic lime, and\r\noftentimes has so emphasized his point that farmers have become\r\nunwilling to apply fresh or water-slaked lime to their land.\r\nManufacturers of hydrated lime in some instances have made a confused\r\nsituation worse by insisting upon the claim that there was a fertilizing\r\nquality in their goods. Some dealers in lime marls have been unwilling\r\nto have the value of their goods rated according to the content of\r\ncarbonate of lime, and have emphasized the value of fine division of the\r\nparticles and the absence of any caustic properties. The presence of\r\nshells, evidencing an organic source of the material, has helped in the\r\nappeal to buyers.\r\n\r\nThe rightful place of magnesia, and the possible danger of injury from\r\nits use, have been a fruitful cause of perplexity, making price per ton\r\nonly a secondary consideration to the man wanting to supply his soil's\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n_Scientists' Failure to Agree._ It is only fair to say that much of the\r\ndoubt and indecision on the part of the public is directly attributable\r\nto the conflicting statements of our scientists. It should be borne in\r\nmind that careful investigation in respect to the relative values of\r\nthe various forms and sources of lime has been confined largely to the\r\nshort period of time that has elapsed since recognition of the lime\r\ndeficiency of our country's soils. Our agricultural literature contained\r\nlittle about soil acidity 20 years ago, and our experiment station tests\r\nafford only relatively recent results. Some knowledge of sour soils and\r\nthe efficacy of lime in their amendment is nearly as old as the history\r\nof agriculture, it is true, but answers to the questions uppermost in\r\nthe minds of men wanting to apply lime to land have been sought only\r\nwithin recent years. The variation in soil types, and in sources of\r\nlime, and in preconceived ideas of men drawing conclusions from\r\nincomplete data may easily account for failure of our soil scientists to\r\nbe in the close agreement in statement that would remove all confusion\r\nin the public mind. However, the agreement respecting the facts is\r\nbecoming better assured with every added year of investigation, as a\r\nstudy of station bulletins shows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Technical Terms._ The practical man uses a great number of technical\r\nterms in his own field of labor, and often fails to recognize the fact\r\nthat they are technical, and may be puzzling to many other people. He\r\nuses such terms for the sake of accuracy, desiring to express to his\r\nfellow-workmen exactly what he means. The farmer, stockman, carpenter,\r\nbanker--all have command of such terms, and need them, but the chemist\r\nwho, in a way, must come even nearer to accuracy in expression, finds\r\nthat many people who want his assistance do not care to master and use\r\nany of his terms. Failure to do so compels misunderstanding. Anyone who\r\nis interested in the right use of lime should be willing to add a few of\r\nthe chemists' technical terms to the scores in his own line of work that\r\nhe uses constantly, and thus let the whole matter of liming land come to\r\nappear more simple to him. Acquaintance with a few terms is necessary\r\nto any understanding of statements of analyses upon which purchase\r\nshould be made.\r\n\r\n_An Element_ is a substance that cannot be divided into simpler\r\nsubstances. The number of elements necessary to the growth of plants is\r\nsmall, and of this number calcium is one and magnesium is another.\r\n\r\n_Compounds._ We do not find these elements merely mixed with other\r\nelements to form a soil. They unite in definite proportions by weight to\r\nform chemical compounds. As conditions change, many of these compounds\r\nundergo change, giving up one element, or group of elements, and uniting\r\nwith another element or group from a different compound. Heat, moisture\r\nand the action of bacteria are factors in promoting the changes. There\r\nis no more restless activity than may be found among the elements\r\ncomposing a productive soil.\r\n\r\n_Calcium_ is an element which will unite with oxygen and carbon dioxide\r\nto form a compound known as calcium carbonate. The chemist's symbol for\r\ncalcium is Ca.\r\n\r\n_Calcium Oxide_ is a compound left after the burning of limestone, and\r\nis known as fresh burned lime, or quick lime. Its formula is CaO. It\r\ncontains, when pure, 40 parts of calcium and 16 parts oxygen by weight.\r\n\r\n_Carbon Dioxide_ is a compound whose formula is CO2.\r\n\r\n_Calcium Carbonate_, known also as carbonate of lime, has a definite\r\ncomposition, containing, when pure, 56 parts CaO and 44 parts CO2. It\r\nis known to the chemist as CaCO3, and forms practically all of very\r\npure limestones. Impure limestones contain some earthy materials that\r\nbecame mixed with the lime carbonate when the rock was being formed.\r\n\r\n_Calcium Hydroxide_ is a compound made by permitting calcium oxide to\r\ncombine with water, and is known as lime hydrate. It contains 56 parts\r\nby weight CaO and 18 parts water, and has the formula Ca(OH)2.\r\n\r\n_Magnesium_ is an element, and is found in magnesium carbonate, a\r\ncompound that is effective in correcting soil acidity.\r\n\r\n_Magnesian Limestone._ Magnesium carbonate is usually found in\r\ncombination with calcium carbonate, and when about 47 per cent of the\r\ntotal carbonates is magnesium carbonate, the limestone is known as\r\ndolomite.\r\n\r\n_Ground Limestone_ is the stone pulverized so that it can be\r\ndistributed. It is carbonate of lime (CaCO3), or a combination of\r\ncalcium and magnesium carbonate, and in a way has a right to be\r\ndesignated as \"lime,\" but such use leads to confusion.\r\n\r\n_Fresh Burned Lime_. Calcium oxide (CaO) formerly was accurately\r\ndesignated as \"lime,\" but the words \"fresh burned\" are often prefixed to\r\nprevent confusion with lime carbonate or the hydrate. It is known as\r\n\"lump lime,\" \"caustic lime\" and \"stone lime.\"\r\n\r\n_Ground or Pulverized Lime_. Fresh burned lime may be ground fine, so\r\nthat it can be spread on land without slaking. This product should not\r\nbe confused with ground limestone or hydrated lime. Fresh ground lime is\r\nworth nearly twice as much per ton as ground limestone, but some of the\r\nproduct on the market is far from pure. There is opportunity to grind up\r\nunburned and waste material with the caustic lime, and this form of lime\r\nusually contains some hydrated material.\r\n\r\n_Hydrated Lime_ is the compound formed by the action of water or steam\r\non fresh burned lime.\r\n\r\n_Air-Slaked Lime_ is a compound formed by the action of carbon dioxide\r\nfrom the air on hydrated lime, and its formula is CaCO3, which is\r\nthat of pure limestone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Indiana Limestone Quarry]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Limestone Plant (Courtesy of the Michigan Limestone\r\nCompany)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGROUND LIMESTONE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation in Quality._ Limestones vary widely in purity. They were\r\nformed under water, and clay and sand were laid down with the lime in\r\nsuch quantity in some cases that the resulting stone is not worth\r\nhandling for soil improvement. A stone that is practically all carbonate\r\nof calcium, or a combination of calcium and magnesium, is wanted because\r\nit is these two elements that give value to the material. If a poor\r\nstone is used, too much waste matter must be handled. Twenty-five per\r\ncent more ground limestone of 80% purity must be applied than would be\r\nrequired in the case of an absolutely pure limestone. Any stone above\r\n90% pure in carbonate of lime and magnesia is rated as good, but the\r\nbest stone runs from 96% to 99%.\r\n\r\nLimestones vary greatly in ability to resist disintegration, and this\r\nvariation is a big factor in determining the agricultural value of\r\nground limestone that has not been reduced to a fine powder. Particles\r\nof a hard limestone may lie inert in the soil for many years. Hardness\r\nalso affects the cost of grinding.\r\n\r\n_A Matter of Distribution._ Nature has used various agencies in reducing\r\nlimestone for the making of soils. The stone contained its lime in\r\ncarbonate form, and when reduced to good physical condition for\r\ndistribution it helped to make highly productive land. We know that lime\r\ncarbonate does the needed work in the soil so far as correction of\r\nacidity is concerned, but in the form of blocks of limestone it has no\r\nparticular value to the land. Burning and slaking afforded to man a\r\nnatural means of putting it into form for distribution, and it is only\r\nwithin recent years that the pulverization of limestone for land has\r\nbecome a business of considerable magnitude. The ground limestone used\r\non land continues to be in part a by-product of the preparation of\r\nlimestone for the manufacture of steel, glass, etc., and the making of\r\nroads, the fine dust being screened out for agricultural purposes. These\r\nsources of supply are very inadequate, and too remote from much land\r\nthat requires treatment. Large plants have been established in various\r\nparts of the country for the purpose of crushing limestone for use on\r\nland, and quite recently low-priced pulverizers for farm use have come\r\nupon the market and are meeting a wide need.\r\n\r\n_Low-Priced Pulverizers._ A serious drawback to the liming of land is\r\nthe transportation charge that must be paid where no available stone can\r\nbe found in the region. Great areas do have some beds that should be\r\nused, and a low-priced machine for pulverizing it is the solution of the\r\nproblem. Such a machine must be durable, have ability to crush the stone\r\nto the desired fineness and be offered at a price that does not seem\r\nprohibitive to a farmer who would meet the demands of a small farming\r\ncommunity. In this way freight charges are escaped, and a long and\r\ncostly haul from a railway point is made unnecessary. The limestone of\r\nthe locality will be made available more and more by means of this type\r\nof machine, and the inducement to correct the acidity of soils will be\r\ngiven to tens of thousands of land-owners who would not find it feasible\r\nto pay freight and cartage on supplies coming a long distance. There\r\nshould be a market many times greater than now exists for the product\r\nof all large plants, while the number of small pulverizers multiplies\r\nrapidly. The very large areas that have no limestone at hand must\r\ncontinue to buy from manufacturers equipped to supply them, and farmers\r\nwithin a zone of small freight charges should be able to buy from such\r\nmanufacturers more cheaply than they could pulverize stone on their own\r\nfarms.\r\n\r\nAn individual, or a group of farmers, will buy a machine for pulverizing\r\nlimestone at a cost of a few hundred dollars when costly equipment would\r\nbe out of the question. If he has a bed of limestone of fair quality,\r\nand the soil of the region is lacking in lime, an efficient grinder or\r\npulverizer solves the problem and makes prosperity possible to the\r\nregion. Within the last few years much headway has been made in\r\nperfecting such machines, and their manufacturers have them on the\r\nmarket. Any type should be bought only after a test that shows capacity\r\nper hour and degree of fineness of the product. As a high degree of\r\nfineness is at the expense of power or time, and as the transportation\r\ncharge on the product to the farm is small, there is no requirement for\r\nthe fineness wanted in a high-priced article that must be used\r\nsparingly.\r\n\r\nThe aim should be to store in the soil for a term of years, and the\r\ncoarse portion is preferable to the fine for this purpose because it\r\nwill not leach out. The heavy application will furnish enough fine stuff\r\nto take care of present acidity. If nearly all the product of such a\r\npulverizer will pass through a 10-mesh screen, and the amount applied is\r\ndouble that of very fine limestone, it should give immediate results and\r\ncontinue effective nearly twice as long as the half amount of finer\r\nmaterial. There could hardly be a practical solution of the liming\r\nproblem for many regions without the development of such devices for\r\npreparing limestone for distribution, and it is a matter of\r\ncongratulation that some manufacturers have awakened to the market\r\npossibilities our country affords.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSTORING LIME IN THE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\n_Liberal Use of Limestone._ Land never does its best when skimped in any\r\nway. As we raise the percentage of carbonate of lime in land that\r\nnaturally is deficient, we give increasing ability to such land to take\r\non some of the desirable characteristics of a limestone soil. It is poor\r\nbusiness to be making a hand-to-mouth fight against a state of actual\r\nacidity unless the cost of more liberal treatment is prohibitive. The\r\nmost satisfactory liming is done where the expense is light enough to\r\njustify the free use of material. When this is the case, extreme\r\nfineness of all the stone is undesirable. There is the added cost due to\r\nsuch fineness and no gain if the finer portion is sufficient to correct\r\nthe acidity, and the coarser particles disintegrate as rapidly as needed\r\nin later years.\r\n\r\n_Loss by Leaching._ Another valid argument against extreme fineness of\r\nthe stone used in liberal applications is the danger of loss by\r\nleaching. Soils are so variable in their ability to hold what may be\r\ngiven them that it is idle to offer any estimate on this point. The\r\namount of lime found in the drainage waters of limestone land teaches no\r\nlesson of value for other land, the excessive loss in the former case\r\nbeing due oftentimes to erosion that creates channels through the\r\nsubsoil, through which soil and lime pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Limestone Pulverizer for Farm Use (Courtesy of the\r\nJeffrey Manufacturing Company, Columbus, Ohio)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Lime Pulver in Operation (Courtesy of the Jeffrey\r\nManufacturing Company)]\r\n\r\nBut we do know the tendency of lime to get away, and the use of several\r\ntons of fine stone per acre may easily be followed by loss in many types\r\nof soil. It is wholly reasonable to believe that some portion of such an\r\napplication should be coarse enough to stay where put until needed by\r\nexhaustion of the finer portion. It is upon this theory that coarser\r\nmaterial often is preferred to the very finest.\r\n\r\n_What Degree of Fineness?_ Assuming that the farmer is in a position to\r\nstore some carbonate of lime in his land for future use, giving the soil\r\nan alkaline character for five or 10 years, the degree of fineness of\r\nthe stone is important, partly because there will be distinct loss by\r\nleaching from many types of soils if all the material is fine as dust,\r\nand specially because less finely pulverized material can be supplied\r\nhim at a lower price per ton. Much by-product in the manufacture of\r\ncoarse limestone for other purposes contains a considerable percentage\r\nof material that would not pass through a 60-, or 40-, or 10-mesh\r\nscreen, but it does contain a big percentage of immediately available\r\nlime, and a more complete pulverization of this by-product would add\r\ngreatly to its cost.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that a ton of such stone may be bought at a price\r\nthat would cover the value only of the fine portion, estimated on the\r\nbasis of the prevailing price of finely ground material, the coarse\r\nmaterial being obtained without any cost at all. It is this situation,\r\nor an approach to it, that leads some authorities to become strenuous\r\nadvocates of the use of coarsely pulverized stone. The advice is right\r\nfor those who are in a position to accept it. If the money available for\r\nliming an acre of land can buy all the fine stone needed for the present\r\nand some coarser stone mixed with it for later use by the soil, the\r\npurchase is much more rational than the investment of the same amount of\r\nmoney in very fine stone that has no admixture of coarser material. If\r\nthe investment in the former case is larger than in the latter, it\r\ncontinues to be good business up to a certain point, and the room for\r\nsome uncertainty is wide enough to provide for much difference in\r\njudgment.\r\n\r\n_Quality of the Stone._ Another factor of uncertainty is the hardness of\r\nthe stone. A limestone may have such flinty characteristics that a piece\r\nbarely able to pass through a 10-mesh screen will not disintegrate in\r\nthe soil for years, and there are other types of limestone that go into\r\npieces rapidly. The variation in quality of stone accounts for no little\r\ndifference in opinion that is based upon limited observation.\r\n\r\n_Using One's Judgment._ It is evident that no hard and fast rule\r\nrespecting fineness may be laid down, and yet a rather definite basis\r\nfor judgment is needed. There is much good experience to justify the\r\nrequirement that when all ground lime is high-priced in any section for\r\nany reason, and the amount applied per acre is thereby restricted, the\r\nmaterial should be able to pass through a screen having 60 wires to the\r\nlinear inch, and that the greater part should be much finer. Usually\r\nsome part of such stone will pass through a 200-mesh screen. When a\r\nlimestone on the market will not meet this test, some concession in\r\nprice should be expected. If the stone is not very flinty, a 40-mesh\r\nscreen may be regarded as affording a reasonably satisfactory test.\r\n\r\nAn increasing percentage of coarser material makes necessary an increase\r\nin amount to meet the lime deficiency, and a distinct concession in\r\nprice is to be expected when a 10-mesh screen is used in testing. At the\r\nsame time a careful buyer will use a 60-mesh screen to determine the\r\npercentage that probably has availability for the immediate future. A\r\ncoarsely ground article, containing any considerable percentage that\r\nwill not pass through a 10-mesh screen, must sell at a price justifying\r\nan application sufficient to meet the need of the soil for a long term\r\nof years, as the greater part has no immediate availability, and only a\r\nheavy application can provide a good supply for immediate need.\r\n\r\n_New York State Experience._ A bulletin of the New York agricultural\r\nexperiment station, published early in 1917, calls attention to the\r\nrapid increase in demand for ground limestone in New York. Within the\r\nlast five years the number of grinding plants within the state had\r\nincreased from one to 56, and more than a dozen outside plants are\r\nshipping extensively into the state. The bulletin says: \"Farmers who\r\nhave had experience with the use of ground limestone are as a rule\r\nsatisfied with only a reasonable degree of fineness, and are able to\r\njudge the material by inspection. When limestone is ground so the entire\r\nproduct will pass a 10-mesh (or 2 mm.) sieve, the greater part of it\r\nwill be finer than a 40-mesh (or 1/2 mm.) sieve.... There are now in\r\noperation in this State more than a dozen small portable community\r\ngrinders; they are doing much to help solve the ground limestone problem\r\nand their use is rapidly increasing. In the practical operation of these\r\nmachines they grind only to medium fineness (2 mm.). To insist upon\r\nextreme fineness is to discourage their use.\"\r\n\r\nThis State experiment station is only one of many scientific authorities\r\napproving the use of limestone reduced only to such fineness that it\r\nwill pass through a 10-mesh screen, the cost of the grinding being\r\nsufficiently small to permit heavy applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFRESH BURNED LIME\r\n\r\n\r\n_An Old Practice._ The beneficial effect of caustic lime on land is\r\nmentioned in some ancient writings. Burning and slaking afforded the\r\nonly known method of reducing stone for use in sour soils. Lime in this\r\nform not only is an effective agent for correcting soil acidity, but it\r\nimproves the physical condition of tough and intractable clays,\r\nrendering them more friable and easy of tillage. Caustic lime also\r\nrenders the organic matter in the soil more quickly available, an\r\nincrease in yield quickly following an application. These three effects\r\nof burned lime brought it into favor, and a rational use would have\r\ncontinued it in favor.\r\n\r\n_Irrational Use._ The ability of caustic lime to improve the physical\r\ncondition of land and to make inert plant food available has led many\r\nfarmers to treat it as a substitute for manure, sods and commercial\r\nfertilizers. Immoderate use gave increased crop yields for a time, and\r\nthe inference was easy that lime could displace the old sources of\r\nplant food supplies. It became the custom in some regions to apply 200\r\nto 300 bushels per acre to stiff limestone soils that had no lime\r\ndeficiency, as a test for acidity would have shown. The lime not only\r\nmade some mineral plant available, but it attacked the organic matter of\r\nthe soil, making it ready for immediate use and leaving the land\r\ndeficient in humus. Wherever stable manure and clover sods were not\r\nfreely used, the heavy application of caustic lime was followed\r\nultimately by decline in productive power. Such practice has come under\r\nthe condemnation of people who have not seen that the ill results have\r\nno relation to the rational use of lime.\r\n\r\n_What Lime Is._ There is abundant evidence that pulverized limestone, or\r\nlime marl, or oystershell, or any other form of carbonate of lime,\r\ncorrects soil acidity and helps to make a soil productive. It is good,\r\nno matter whether nature mixed the lime carbonate with clay, etc., to\r\nmake a choice limestone soil, or man applied it. Fresh burned lime is\r\nonly the stone after some worthless matter has been driven off by use of\r\nheat. The limestone, carbonate of lime, is represented by the formula\r\nCaCO_3. When heat is applied under right conditions the carbon dioxide,\r\nCO_2, is driven off, and there remains CaO, which is calcium oxide,\r\ncalled fresh burned lime.\r\n\r\nIf there were 100 pounds of the stone, and it was absolutely pure, 44\r\npounds would escape in form of the carbon dioxide, which had no value,\r\nand 56 pounds would remain. The 56 pounds calcium oxide, or fresh burned\r\nlime, have the same power to correct acidity as this same material had\r\nwhen it was bound up in the 100 pounds of limestone. The 44 pounds were\r\ndriven off by heat, while if the limestone had not been burned the 44\r\nwould have separated from the 56 pounds in an acid soil, leaving the\r\nactual lime to do the needed work of correcting acidity.\r\n\r\n_Affecting Physical Condition._ While burning the stone does not affect\r\nthe ability to correct acidity, it does increase the power to make a\r\nstiff soil friable and to bind a sandy soil. No one may say how much\r\nthis power to influence soil texture is increased, but it is marked, and\r\nwhen improved physical condition is the chief reason for applying lime,\r\nthere is no question that fresh burned material is to be preferred to\r\npulverized stone or marl, or any other carbonate form. A light\r\napplication is not markedly effective in this respect, and the chief use\r\nfor this purpose has been in limestone areas that may not have had any\r\nlime deficiency, but did have a stiff soil. The presence of the stone in\r\ngreat quantity for burning on the farm made heavy applications possible.\r\n\r\n_Using Up Organic Matter._ The presence of carbonate of lime in the form\r\nof pulverized limestone or marl favors the disintegration of any organic\r\nmatter, but the action is so slow that it may not be observed. While the\r\nuse of limestone in manure piles is inadvisable for this reason, the\r\nloss is not comparable to that resulting from mixing caustic lime with\r\nmanure. The caustic lime in a soil hastens decay of vegetable matter in\r\na degree impossible to the limestone or marl. Irrational use of the\r\nformer has produced such destructive action in many instances that the\r\nfailure to add manure or heavy sods for a long term of years has led to\r\nheavy decline in producing power.\r\n\r\nWe are naturally so lacking in judicial temper that opinion has swung\r\nviolently from favor to disfavor. As most soils need organic matter, we\r\nseize upon the thought that anything evidently inclined to use it up is\r\nan evil. The purpose of tillage is in no small degree to bring about\r\ndisintegration and resulting exhaustion of vegetable matter. The latter\r\nis a storehouse of plant food, and some of it is needed to feed the crop\r\ndesired. Tillage is no more to be commended for this purpose than a\r\nquantity of lime equivalent in power to do the needed work. Excepting\r\nthe case of raw soils rich in the remains of plants, most land hardly\r\nneeds lime for this purpose, it may be, the tillage required for making\r\na seed bed retentive of moisture and for control of weeds being\r\neffective, but the point is emphasized that the disintegration of\r\norganic matter into available plant food is one of the chief aims of a\r\ngood farmer. It is only the excessive use of caustic lime that causes\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nThe use of caustic lime in sufficient amount to correct all acidity, and\r\nthe use of such material to free plant food in humus sufficiently to\r\nproduce heavy sods, are just as good farm practices as drainage and the\r\napplication of manure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laying Foundation for a Lime Stack at the Pennsylvania\r\nExperiment Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Stack Nearly Completed at the Pennsylvania Experiment\r\nStation]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nBURNING LIME\r\n\r\n\r\n_Methods of Burning._ Limestone contains the calcium and magnesium that\r\nmust be the chief source of supply of American soils, though marls,\r\nashes, etc., have their place. The burning of the stone has been the\r\nleading means of bringing it to a condition of availability to the soil,\r\nexcepting, of course, the vast work of disintegration carried on through\r\nall the ages by nature. Pulverization of the rock by machinery for use\r\non land is recent.\r\n\r\nThe devices for burning are various, a modern lime plant containing\r\nimmense kilns, cylindrical in form, the stone being fed into them at the\r\ntop continuously, and the lime removed at the bottom. A large part of\r\nthe lime that is sold for use on land is made in plants of this kind.\r\nSome is burned in kilns of cheap construction, but a traveler through a\r\nlimestone country finds few such kilns now in use.\r\n\r\n_The Farm Lime Heap._ A common method of producing lime for farm use\r\nhas been, and continues to be, a simple and inexpensive one, involving\r\nthe use only of wood, coal and limestone, with earth as a covering. Dr.\r\nWm. Frear, chemist of the Pennsylvania station, in Bulletin 261 of the\r\nPennsylvania department of agriculture, describes a method of burning\r\nlime on the farm as follows: \"A convenient oblong piece of ground is\r\ncleared, and leveled if need be, to secure a fit platform. Upon this\r\nlevel is placed a layer or two of good cord wood, better well seasoned,\r\narranged in such manner as to afford horizontal draught passages into\r\nthe interior of the heap. Between the chinks in the cord wood, shavings,\r\nstraw or other light kindling is placed. The stone having been reduced\r\nto the size of a double fist, sometimes not so small, is laid upon the\r\ncord wood, care being taken to leave chinks between the stones just as\r\nbetween the bricks in a brick kiln. It is preferred that this layer of\r\nstone should not exceed six to ten inches in thickness.\r\n\r\n\"In some cases, temporary wooden flues, filled with straw, are erected,\r\neither one at the center or, if the heap is elliptical, one near each\r\nend, and the stone and coal are built up around them; thus, when they\r\nare burned out, a chimney or two is secured, which may be damped by\r\npieces of stone or sod. Upon this first layer of stone is spread a layer\r\nof coal, and upon that a thicker layer of stone (12 inches), and so on,\r\ncoal and stone alternating until the heap is topped with smaller stone.\r\nThe largest stones should be placed near the top of the heap, but not\r\nnear the outside, so that they may be exposed to the highest heat. The\r\nproportion of coal is diminished in the upper layers, the effort being\r\nto distribute one-half of the total coal employed in the two lower\r\nlayers, so as to secure the highest economy possible in the use of the\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\n\"Fire is then kindled in the straw or shavings; when the flames have\r\ncommunicated themselves to the cord wood and lowermost layer of coal,\r\nand tongues of flame shoot out from the crevices in the sides of the\r\nheap, earth, previously loosened by a few turns of the plow about the\r\nheap, is rapidly spread over the entire heap, thus damping the drafts\r\nand retarding the combustion. Steam and smoke slowly escape during the\r\nfirst hours, but later the entire heap, including the outer covering of\r\nearth, is heated to a dull red glow. The burning goes on slowly for\r\nseveral days, the interior often being hot for several weeks. When the\r\nlower portion of the heap has reached an advanced stage of calcination,\r\na portion of the outer layer of lime sometimes slips down; if so, a\r\nfresh covering of earth must promptly be applied at the exposed point;\r\notherwise it will serve as a vent for the heat, and the top and other\r\nsides will fail of proper calcination.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of Excessive Use of Burned Lime Without Manure at\r\nthe Pennsylvania Experiment Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Hydrated Lime Plant\r\n\r\n(Courtesy of the Palmer Lime and Cement Company, York, Pa.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLIME HYDRATE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Slaking Lime._ The usual means of reducing fresh burned stone lime to a\r\ncondition that makes even distribution upon land possible is by slaking.\r\nA few years ago considerable effort was made to create a market for lime\r\npulverized by machinery, but the difficulty in excluding the moisture of\r\nthe air so that packages would not burst has been in the way of\r\ndeveloping a market. Slaking, by the addition of water to the fresh\r\nburned lime, is the common method of getting the required physical\r\ncondition. When the slaking is done on the farm, the custom has been to\r\ndistribute the lime in small piles in the field, placing the piles at\r\nsuch convenient distance apart that the lime, after slaking, could be\r\nspread easily with a shovel.\r\n\r\nThe water for slaking comes from rains, or from moisture in the air and\r\nearth. The method is wasteful and can be justified, if ever, only where\r\nfarm-burned lime costs little per ton, and the nature of the soil is\r\nsuch that a relatively heavy application can be safely made. The\r\ndistribution is necessarily uneven, and if the required amount goes upon\r\nall the surface, a great excess is sure to go upon a portion of it. Very\r\noften an excess of water puddles much of the lime in the pile, and lumps\r\nmay be seen lying in ineffective form in the soil for years. The\r\npractice is responsible for much of the excessive application that\r\nbrought the use of caustic lime into disrepute.\r\n\r\n_Slaking in Large Heaps._ A preferable method is to put the lime in flat\r\nheaps of large size and about four feet deep, so that water may be\r\napplied or advantage be taken of rainfall. The value of the lime is so\r\ngreat that one can well afford to draw water and apply with a hose so\r\nthat the quantity can be controlled with exactness. When fresh burned\r\nlime is perfectly slaked, each 56 pounds of pure lime becomes 74 pounds\r\nof hydrated lime, water furnishing the added weight.\r\n\r\n_Hydrated Lime on the Market._ A popular form of lime on the market is\r\nthe hydrate. Manufacturers first burn the stone, and in the case of a\r\npure limestone they drive off 44 pounds of each 100 pounds of the\r\nweight in burning. Then, they combine enough water with the lime to\r\nchange it to hydrate form, and that adds 18 pounds weight. It is run\r\nthrough a sieve to remove any coarse material, and then packed in bags\r\nwhich help to exclude the air. The small packages in which it comes upon\r\nthe market make handling easy, and this helps to bring it into demand.\r\nIts good physical condition makes even distribution possible, and thus\r\npermits maximum effectiveness to be obtained. It is only slaked lime,\r\nidentical in composition and value with lime of the same purity slaked\r\non the farm, but some dealers have been able to create the impression\r\nthat it has some added quality and peculiar power. This does no credit\r\nto the public intelligence, but the hunger of soils for lime is so great\r\nthat investment at a price wholly out of proportion to the price of\r\nfarm-slaked lime has rarely failed to yield some profit.\r\n\r\n_Degree of Purity._ It is always a reasonable assumption that hydrated\r\nlime has been made from stone of a good degree of purity. A local stone,\r\nburned on the farm, may be of low grade, but no man of business judgment\r\nwould erect a costly plant for burning and hydrating lime where the\r\npurity of the stone would not afford a good advertisement in itself.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we find very little hydrated lime on the market that\r\nhas not had sufficient exposure to the air to become changed in some\r\npart to an air-slaked condition, or has had refuse mixed with it.\r\nAir-slaked lime is not worth as much per ton as the hydrate because it\r\ncannot correct as much soil acidity, and the percentage of the former\r\ncannot be determined by the buyer. Its presence may not be due to any\r\nwrong-doing of the manufacturer, and, on the other hand, the increase in\r\nweight that attends air-slaking may be welcomed in some degree by a\r\ndishonest manufacturer before the goods are shipped. The difficulty in\r\npreventing hydrated lime from adding to its weight by becoming\r\nair-slaked is a point to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nThe percentages of air-slaked material in hydrated limes are widely\r\nvariable, and no manufacturer can standardize his product on the market\r\nsurely for the benefit of the farmer. In some instances the product is\r\nadulterated with refuse material in finely pulverized condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nOTHER FORMS OF LIME\r\n\r\n\r\n_Air-Slaked Lime._ A pure limestone is a carbonate, and the chemical\r\nformula is CaCO_3. When it is burned, the carbon dioxide (CO_2) is\r\ndriven off, leaving CaO, which is calcium oxide, called fresh burned\r\nlime. In this process 44 pounds of a stone weighing 100 pounds passes\r\ninto the air, and there remain 56 pounds of lime. When it air-slakes, it\r\ntakes back the carbon dioxide from the air, and the new product becomes\r\nCaCO3, or carbonate of lime, and regains its original weight of 100\r\npounds. This is what would happen if the process were complete, and it\r\nis nearly so when the exposure to the air is as perfect as possible.\r\n\r\nFifty-six pounds of valuable material are in the 100 pounds of\r\nair-slaked lime, just as is the case with limestone, and there is no\r\ndifference in effectiveness except in so far as the air-slaked material\r\nis absolutely fine and available, while most pulverized limestone is\r\nless so. In making purchase for use of land the buyer cannot afford to\r\nmake any appreciable difference in price in favor of air-slaked lime,\r\nas compared with a fine stone.\r\n\r\n_Air-Slaking a Slow Process._ Lime changes to an air-slaked condition\r\nslowly unless it has full exposure. Old heaps will remain in hydrate\r\nform for many years, excepting the outside coat, which excludes the air.\r\nComplete air-slaking would not reduce ability to correct soil acidity,\r\nthe total amount of calcium and magnesium remaining constant, but weight\r\nwould be added in the slaking, and therefore the value per ton would be\r\nreduced. The slowness with which air-slaking proceeds gives reason to\r\nexpect that any bulk of old lime may contain a considerable percentage\r\nof the hydrate, and therefore have greater strength than a true\r\ncarbonate like limestone. This is a consideration of value to a buyer.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Lime._ Some manufacturers have found in the demand for\r\nlime by farmers an opportunity of disposing of much material that would\r\nnot be satisfactory to manufacturers and builders. In some cases this\r\nso-called agricultural lime is sold at a price that is not beyond value,\r\nbut it varies much in its content of pure lime. If the unburned cores\r\nof kilns are ground up, the material simply retains the value of\r\nunburned stone. Any air-slaked material put into it has like value.\r\nForkings, ground up, have less value, and sometimes no value at all.\r\nSome better material may go into this mixture that is given the name\r\n\"agricultural lime,\" and the product cannot be standardized or have a\r\nvaluation given it that would be true for another lot.\r\n\r\nSome manufacturers are marketing limes of fair values under this\r\ndesignation, but the values change as the material changes. There are\r\nother manufacturers who are putting poor stuff on the market. Unless one\r\nknows the manufacturer and his processes, he should not pay a great deal\r\nfor \"agricultural lime.\" It is much better to buy a high-grade lime or\r\nlimestone that is more nearly constant in composition. When the word\r\n\"agricultural\" is part of the brand, there is assurance that the\r\npercentage of waste stuff in it is relatively high. Unless one knows to\r\nthe contrary, he should assume that a ton of finely pulverized limestone\r\nis worth more per ton than \"agricultural lime.\"\r\n\r\n_Marl._ Marls vary in composition, as limestones do, but there are beds\r\nof chalky marl that contain very little clay and sand and are nearly a\r\npure carbonate. It is only marls of high degree of purity that can be\r\nput on the market with profit, but beds of less pure marl furnish\r\ndressings for farms of the locality in many sections of the country.\r\nSome of these inferior marls have had so much clay and sand mixed with\r\nthe lime carbonate that dressings must be heavy. The best lime marls\r\nprovide excellent material for the correction of soil acidity, the\r\nactual value per ton being practically the same as that of the finest\r\npulverized limestone. Some dealers in marl make extravagant claims for\r\ntheir goods, but any farmer may easily put these claims to the test and\r\nlearn that he should not expect more than a fairly good carbonate of\r\nlime can do.\r\n\r\nMarl improves the physical condition of stiff soils only when used in\r\nlarge amount per acre, and this is true of any carbonate form, such as\r\nlimestone. Little effect upon physical condition should be expected from\r\nthe light application usually given when marl is purchased and\r\ntransported some distance to the farm. The chalk marl on the market is\r\nused to correct soil acidity, and at the best it is worth only what good\r\nlime carbonate is worth. It has no hidden virtues, and cannot take the\r\nplace of fertilizers. It is an excellent means of meeting the\r\nlime-requirement of land when bought right, and its fine division makes\r\nit distinctly superior to coarse stone.\r\n\r\nThere should be no confusion of a lime marl with the so-called \"green\r\nsand\" marl. The latter is low in lime, and may be acid, the value of the\r\nmarl being in a considerable percentage of plant food contained.\r\n\r\n_Oyster Shell._ Ground oyster shell is a good source of carbonate of\r\nlime. The percentage falls below that of limestone, but in addition\r\nthere is a little nitrogen and phosphoric acid. An analysis of a good\r\nquality of oyster shell, as found on the market, will show 90% carbonate\r\nof lime.\r\n\r\nBurned oyster shell has something near the same composition as lime made\r\nfrom stone, but it goes back to hydrate and air-slaked forms rapidly.\r\nThere is no large amount of burned shell lime on the market, the\r\nmaterial known as shell lime being the ground shell, or lime carbonate.\r\n\r\n_Wood Ashes._ A large supply of lime in excellent form was afforded by\r\nhardwood ashes, but this product has ceased to have any important value\r\nto our agriculture. The chief supply on the market is low in quality,\r\ncontaining moisture and dirt in considerable amount, the form of lime\r\nbeing changed from an oxide to the hydrate and carbonate.\r\n\r\n_Gas Lime._ Prof. E. B. Voorhees, in \"First Principles of Agriculture,\"\r\nsays: \"Gas lime is also frequently used as manure; in gas works,\r\nquicklime is used for removing the impurities from the gas. Gas lime,\r\ntherefore, varies considerably in composition, and consists really of a\r\nmixture of slaked lime, or calcium hydrate, and carbonate of lime,\r\ntogether with sulfites and sulfides of lime. These last are injurious to\r\nyoung plant life, and gas lime should be applied long before the crop is\r\nplanted, or at least exposed to the air some time before its\r\napplication. The action of air converts the poisonous substances in it\r\ninto non-injurious products. Gas lime contains on an average 40% of\r\ncalcium oxide, and usually a small percentage of nitrogen.\"\r\n\r\n_Lime After Magnesium Removal._ A by-product in the removal of\r\nmagnesium from a magnesian limestone is an excellent material for\r\ncorrection of soil acidity, on account of its physical condition. Its\r\nexposure to the air causes much of the hydrate to change to an\r\nair-slaked form, and its value per ton lies somewhere between that of\r\nvery finely pulverized limestone and hydrated lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nMAGNESIAN LIME\r\n\r\n\r\n_Magnesium._ As an element of plant food, magnesium is as essential as\r\ncalcium. It leaches out of the soil less readily, and there may be even\r\nless need of its application as a plant food, though the need of calcium\r\napplications for this purpose is assumed to be small. In the correction\r\nof soil acidity magnesium is more effective than calcium, 84 pounds of\r\nthe carbonate being equal to 100 pounds of calcium carbonate. It is a\r\ncurious fact, however, that there is widespread fear of magnesium as a\r\nsoil amendment. This is not traceable to any considerable experience by\r\npractical farmers that inspires caution in its use, although immense\r\nquantities of magnesian limestone and lime have been used. Neither is it\r\ndue to any weight of evidence against it in the experience or teachings\r\nof soil chemists and experiments. The facts of the case appear to be as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n1. An investigator found in his laboratory that a plant growing in a\r\nwater solution was injured when magnesium was added, and that the\r\ninjury was checked when calcium in equal amount was added to the water.\r\nThe theory was worked out that a soil should not contain a greater total\r\namount of magnesium than of calcium, and as the soil's supply of calcium\r\ntends to leach out more readily than the supply of magnesium, it was\r\nbest to use a high-calcium lime. If this discovery of the laboratory had\r\nbeen carried into the field, its significance would have dwindled to\r\nzero in the case of normal soils, and a lot of exploitation would have\r\nbeen rendered impossible. As it was, the discussion went merrily along\r\nuntil it occurred to some one to test the matter in the soils where\r\nplants grow, and one would now hear little of it if commercial interests\r\nwere not at stake.\r\n\r\n2. Very much of our limestone supply is high in magnesium, and some men\r\nwho have limestone very low in magnesium and high in calcium have done a\r\ngood stroke of business for themselves by deepening the public's\r\nimpression, due to laboratory tests with water cultures, that magnesium\r\nin lime is injurious.\r\n\r\n3. Many people knew \"lime,\" but had no knowledge of magnesia, and if it\r\nwas an impurity like clay or sand, cutting down value per ton, and if it\r\nwas worse because harmful, they wanted none of it.\r\n\r\n_The Fact's Importance._ If every farm could get its supply of pure\r\ncalcium lime as cheaply as it can have magnesian lime, the truth\r\nrespecting the value of the latter would have small agricultural\r\nimportance, but as a great bulk of farm and commercial supplies of lime\r\nis magnesian, financial injury has been done consumers who have paid\r\nmore than should have been paid for relatively pure calcium lime and\r\nlimestone, being afraid to use goods whose content of magnesium was not\r\nsmall. It is poor policy to use either kind of burned lime in great\r\nexcess, but when rationally used on all soils except sandy ones, there\r\nis no preference to be exercised that can be based upon performance. A\r\nmagnesian lime corrects as much acidity as a high calcium lime, and a\r\nlittle more, and its use is to be recommended if there is any advantage\r\nin the matter of price, except in the case of distinctly sandy soils.\r\n\r\n_Magnesian Limestone._ Leading scientists making tests of limestone for\r\nnormal soils, use magnesian limestone freely. They recommend its use to\r\nfarmers wherever there is advantage in point of price. The advice is\r\nsafe that the limestone of a given fineness should be chosen whose total\r\npercentage of carbonates of calcium and magnesium is the highest. The\r\nexample of these scientists, buying pulverized limestone for\r\nagricultural colleges and experiment farms, and for their own farms,\r\nshould loosen the curious hold that the early warnings of a laboratory\r\nexperimenter took upon public imagination. The farmer should buy\r\nlimestone on a basis of ability to correct soil acidity, and make each\r\ndollar do the most possible toward that end.\r\n\r\nMost limestones contain some percentage of magnesium, and in the case of\r\na pure dolomite over 45% carbonate is present in combination with\r\ncalcium carbonate. A stone rich in magnesium slakes less readily than\r\none high in calcium, and therefore is preferred by manufacturers\r\nshipping pulverized burnt lime to reach its destination before slaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWHAT SHALL ONE BUY?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relative Values._ The relative strengths of the various materials\r\ncontaining lime may be known and yet doubt continue respecting the\r\nchoice to be made. The conflicting claims of dealers, and inaccurate\r\ndeductions from a single test made by some individual, aid the\r\nconfusion. If there were always the single purpose of correcting soil\r\nacidity, and if there were the same ease of application in case of all\r\nthe materials, the choice would present much less difficulty.\r\nNotwithstanding this, most land now has a lime requirement, or will have\r\none as leaching, crop removal and chemical change within the soil\r\ncontinue, and the puzzle is no worse than a score of others that present\r\nthemselves continuously in farming.\r\n\r\n_Destroying Acids._ The cost of liming to improve the physical condition\r\nof land is prohibitive for most farms remote from supplies of stone that\r\ncan be burned and put upon the land at a low price per ton. Where stone\r\nis at hand, and soils are intractable, lime burned on the farm should\r\nbe used. Some slight benefit to a stiff soil may be obtained from the\r\nlight application that is deemed practicable where all forms are costly,\r\nbut this benefit is not usually marked in case of an application of a\r\nton or less of burned lime. It is a safe statement that most buyers of\r\nlime in some form or other will profit chiefly through the correction of\r\nsoil acidity and promotion of bacterial life. This renders the situation\r\nmore simple as any carbonate, hydrate or oxide of lime will accomplish\r\nthese purposes.\r\n\r\n_Composition._ The first consideration is the actual content of calcium\r\nand magnesium. A guaranteed analysis is the only safe basis of purchase.\r\nThe unstable nature of fresh burned and hydrated forms makes an exact\r\nstatement of percentages impossible for goods not wholly fresh, but at\r\nleast the purity of the original limestone can be judged.\r\n\r\n_Equivalents._ One ton of fresh burned lime, made from pure stone, is\r\nequivalent to 2640 pounds of the hydrate, and to 3570 pounds of\r\npulverized limestone or of air-slaked lime. It is easy to carry in mind\r\nthe proportions expressed by 1, 1-1/3 and 1-3/4. If there were no other\r\nconsiderations, such as convenience in handling, evenness of\r\ndistribution, etc., to take into account, one ton of fresh burned lime,\r\none and a third tons hydrated and one and three-quarters tons finely\r\npulverized limestone would have the same value when delivered in the\r\nfield. Lime fully air-slaked, high-grade marl, and finely pulverized\r\nlimestone would have the same value, ton for ton.\r\n\r\n_Even Distribution._ The value of even distribution is not easily\r\noverestimated. If lime in proper amount does not go into each square\r\nfoot of an acid soil, some of the soil will remain sour unless mixing is\r\ndone by implements of tillage. Lime is diffused laterally through the\r\nsoil in a very slight degree. If a strip of sour land is protected by\r\ncanvas, so that no dust from lime applied to uncovered land can blow\r\nupon it, a seeding to clover will show that plants a few inches from the\r\nedge of the limed area will fail to start thriftily and may die before\r\ntheir roots reach the lime. Full effectiveness of an application is\r\npossible only through even distribution.\r\n\r\n_Using Lump Lime._ Lump lime, slaked on the farm, is difficult to apply\r\nsatisfactorily. Spreading with a shovel from small heaps is bad\r\npractice, and when the lime is slaked in a large heap, it cannot be\r\nhandled as well as pulverized stone or commercial hydrated lime. The\r\nlatter two are in condition for application by means of a lime\r\ndistributor, or even a fertilizer attachment of a grain drill. The\r\nfarm-slaked lime contains impurities that interfere with distribution.\r\n\r\n_An Estimate._ It is always hazardous to attempt an estimate of cost of\r\nlabor without knowing the particular farm conditions, but the expense\r\nand discomfort attending the slaking and use of lime bought in lump\r\nstate justify a willingness to pay as much for a ton of hydrated lime as\r\nlump lime would cost, although the former has only three-fourths as much\r\nstrength as the latter. Some farmers pay nearly twice as much for the\r\nhydrated, partly to escape the inconvenience and partly because they\r\nhope that the extraordinary claims for superiority made by some dealers\r\nmay prove true. They should know that it is only fresh burned lime\r\nslaked, but incline to credit a claim that special treatment enhances\r\nvalue in some mysterious way.\r\n\r\nComparing lump lime with finely pulverized limestone, the factors of\r\nexpense and discomfort and final lack of perfect distribution of the\r\nformer remain important. The stone is relatively easy to handle, being\r\nslightly granular and passing through a distributor without trouble. The\r\nfact that it is not caustic, like the hydrated, is in its favor. When\r\neverything is taken into account, one is justified in using limestone or\r\nair-slaked lime at a cost per ton three-fourths as great as that of lump\r\nlime. It is to be borne in mind that in these estimates the cost per ton\r\nis not that at the factory or at one's own railway station, but on the\r\nfarm. The freight and cartage to the farm are based on weight of\r\nmaterial, and more material per acre is required when the worthless\r\nportion has not been driven off by burning. If one must use one and\r\nthree-quarters tons of limestone to have the equivalent of one ton of\r\nfresh burned lime, it is evident that the cost of freight and cartage of\r\nthe worthless portion might make cost prohibitive if distances were very\r\ngreat. Farms lying a long distance from a railway station may easily\r\nfind that fresh burned lime is the only form of lime they can afford.\r\nThe basis for correct estimate is cost delivered in the field.\r\n\r\n_Storage._ One advantage possessed by the limestone is ease of storage.\r\nThere is no inconvenience or loss. The stone may be ordered at any time\r\nof the year when teams are least busy upon other work, and it can be\r\nheld till wanted. In this way the cost of cartage to the farm may be\r\nkept relatively low, and the material is at hand when wanted, regardless\r\nof rush of work or delays of railroads. This advantage is partial\r\ncounterbalance to the cost of freight on the worthless portion of\r\nunburned stone.\r\n\r\n_Valuing Limestone._ The estimates, so far as labor and convenience are\r\nconcerned, are merely suggestive, and rest upon the presumption that the\r\nstone is satisfactorily fine. It has been urged in another chapter that\r\nimmediate effectiveness is determined by fineness, but as a working\r\nbasis we assumed that when all the stone would pass through a screen\r\nhaving sixty wires to the inch it would give the desired results. The\r\ncoarsest portion would not be available at once, but when an application\r\nis heavy enough to serve for a year or more, we have enough very fine\r\nmaterial in such a grade of stone to meet immediate need. When\r\nestimating values of such a grade and coarser grades, the amount per\r\nacre to be used is a factor. The coarse is unsatisfactory if the price\r\nis not low enough to permit an application sufficient for a considerable\r\nterm of years, so that it will contain all the fine material needed at\r\nonce. In that case the coarser material may be expected to meet later\r\nneed, and may be even more desirable for such purpose, as it would not\r\nbe subject to leaching.\r\n\r\nCoarse grinding costs much less than fine grinding, and it is the\r\nresulting low price that permits the heavy application. As stone varies\r\nin hardness and ability of the small particles to withstand\r\ndisintegrating forces in the soil, an estimate of the difference in\r\nprice between a 60-mesh limestone and a 10-mesh one could not serve as a\r\nsafe guide. The buyer should know the percentages of a limestone passing\r\nthrough screens of various sizes before he makes a purchase, and should\r\ndemand part of the saving in cost of production that attends coarse\r\ngrinding.\r\n\r\n_Oyster Shell._ Ground oyster shell should be given about the same\r\nvaluation as limestone. It is a lime carbonate, and the percentage of\r\nworthless material in it varies somewhat It is coarsely ground, but the\r\nlarge pieces disintegrate in the soil much more rapidly than limestone\r\nwould do. It contains a little nitrogen and phosphoric acid, partially\r\navailable, as an offset to coarseness and some lack of purity, as\r\ncompared with the highest grade of fine stone. It is profitable to buy\r\noyster shell at limestone prices if used liberally enough to furnish a\r\nsupply for a term of years. The oxide, or burned shell lime, would be\r\nnearly the equivalent of burned stone if it did not change to hydrate\r\nand air-slaked forms so rapidly that it rarely is on the market in the\r\n~full~ strength of fresh burned lime.\r\n\r\n_Hardwood Ashes._ As a source of lime, ashes have become far too\r\nexpensive. The composition of ashes on the market is widely variable,\r\ndirt and moisture often accounting for much of the weight. The lime in\r\nfresh burned ashes is peculiarly effective, being finely divided and in\r\noxide form, but the ashes on the market have much of the lime\r\nwater-slaked and air-slaked. Unless analysis is made at time of\r\npurchase, a buyer should not estimate the content of lime in a ton at a\r\nvalue greater than assigned to one-half of a ton of limestone. The\r\nadditional value of the ashes, due to the potash content, is wholly\r\nanother consideration.\r\n\r\n_Marl._ No more should be paid for a ton of good chalk marl than an\r\nequal weight of fine limestone would cost. Each is a good carbonate of\r\nlime, with the same capacity for destruction of acids.\r\n\r\n_Agricultural Lime._ This variable product should not be bought unless\r\nactual composition is known, or the cost is as low as that of pulverized\r\nlimestone, and even then it may be a bad purchase, the methods of the\r\nmanufacturer being the determining factor. If such lime is chiefly a\r\ndumping place for low-grade stone and forkings, it has small\r\nagricultural value.\r\n\r\n_Land Plaster._ The soil wants lime in carbonate form. The oxide and\r\nhydrate change to carbonate, and therefore are good. Land plaster is a\r\nsulphate, and its tendency is to make a soil sour. It should not be\r\nconsidered as a means of correcting soil acidity.\r\n\r\n_Basic Slag._ The amount of effective lime in basic slag, as made by\r\nmodern methods, is so small that its value is nearly negligible. Basic\r\nslag is a good source of phosphorus, and in addition has a tendency\r\ntoward correction of soil acidity, but such tendency has little cash\r\nvalue for land that requires a considerable dressing of lime to furnish\r\na base with which soil acids may combine.\r\n\r\nAn expression of opinion was obtained recently from some leading soil\r\nchemists of this country, and upon such expression we base the estimate\r\nthat when pulverized limestone costs three dollars a ton, the value of\r\nthe lime in a ton of basic slag should not be placed higher than 50\r\ncents, and some chemists believe that the lime content is entirely\r\nnegligible as an agent in soil amendment.\r\n\r\n_Lime in Other Fertilizers._ The demand for lime is leading some men to\r\nstate a lime content for their goods that is designed to mislead. Such\r\nlime is not in a form to combine with soil acids, and is as valueless as\r\nthe very large amount of lime in acid soils that is in compounds having\r\nno power to affect free acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF APPLICATION\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Controlling Principle._ The chief purpose of liming land is to\r\nprovide a base with which acid may combine, so that the soil may be\r\nfriendly to plant life. Lime has little power to distribute itself\r\nthrough a soil, and harmful acid may remain only a few inches distant\r\nfrom the point where lime has been placed. In a general way, the\r\ntendency of lime is downward, especially when the application at the\r\nsurface is heavy. Economical use demands even distribution through the\r\nsoil so that a sufficient amount is in every part. Means to that end are\r\ngood means of distribution.\r\n\r\n_Spreading on Grass._ Where lime is burned on the farm, and little\r\naccount of labor is taken, it has been a common custom to spread the\r\nlime on grass sods the year previous to breaking the sod for corn, using\r\n100 to 300 bushels per acre. Rains carried some of the lime through the\r\nsoil, and the increased yields for a few years were due to the improved\r\nphysical condition of a stiff soil that a heavy application of\r\ncaustic lime produces, and to the disintegration of organic matter and\r\nto change in compounds of mineral plant food. The practice is rightly\r\ngoing into disrepute, being wasteful and harmful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Filling the Lime Spreader at the Ohio Experiment Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lime Distributors]\r\n\r\nThe smaller application of any form of lime to correct soil acidity may\r\nbe made on grass land that should not be plowed, but the full\r\neffectiveness of an application is not secured in top-dressings. If the\r\nland is under a crop rotation, it is better practice not to apply the\r\nlime on grass, but to defer application until the sod has been broken,\r\nwhen the lime can be intimately mixed with the soil by use of harrows.\r\nIt is the rule that it should go on plowed land, and should be mixed\r\nwith the soil before rain puddles it. In no case should it be plowed\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWhen clover or alfalfa shows a lime deficiency, it is advisable to make\r\nan application, either in the spring or after a cutting, obtaining\r\nwhatever degree of effectiveness may be possible to this way, but the\r\nfact remains that full return from an application is secured only after\r\nintimate mixture with the soil particles. On the other hand, if land\r\nneeds lime, and there is not time or labor for the application when the\r\nsoil can be stirred, it is far better to apply on the surface during any\r\nidle time than to leave the soil deficient in lime.\r\n\r\n_Distributors._ The most satisfactory means of distribution is a machine\r\nmade for the purpose. A number of good distributors are on the market.\r\nThey are designed to handle a large quantity of material after the\r\nfashion of a fertilizer distributor ordinarily attached to a grain\r\ndrill. A V-shaped box, with openings at the bottom, and a device to\r\nregulate the quantity per acre, enables the workman to cover the surface\r\nof the ground with an even coat, and the mixing with the soil is done by\r\nharrows.\r\n\r\nLight applications can be made with a drill having a fertilizer\r\nattachment. Some makes of drill have much more capacity than others.\r\nGranular lime, such as limestone, is handled more satisfactorily than a\r\nfloury slaked lime.\r\n\r\n_Farm-Slaked Lime._ Lime slaked on the farm must continue to be a\r\nleading source of supply to land. If there is stone on the farm, and\r\nlabor in the winter is available, it is not a costly source of supply.\r\nThe chief drawback to the use of farm-slaked lime is the difficulty in\r\nsecuring even distribution. The loss from spreading with shovels from\r\nsmall piles slaked in the field is heavy. The quantity per acre must be\r\nlarge to insure sufficient material for every square foot of surface.\r\nThe lime slaked in a large heap can be put through distributors only\r\nafter screening to remove pieces of stone, unless they are made with a\r\nscreening device, and the caustic character and floury condition make\r\nhandling disagreeable, but no other method is as economical when lime is\r\nhigh in price.\r\n\r\n_Use of the Manure Spreader._ The next best device is the manure\r\nspreader. The makes on the market vary in ability to do satisfactory\r\nwork with lime, and none does even work with a small quantity per acre.\r\nAn addition to the bulk to be handled by placing a layer of other\r\nmaterial in the spreader before filling with lime helps, but some\r\nspreaders do fair work in spreading as little as 3000 pounds of slaked\r\nlime per acre, and certainly far better work than usually is done with\r\nshovels from a wagon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nAMOUNT OF LIME PER ACRE\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soils Vary in Requirement._ There is always the insistent question\r\nrespecting the amount of lime that should be used on a particular field.\r\nUsually _no_ definite reply can be safely made. The requirement of the\r\npresent, and probably of the _next_ few years, should be met by one\r\napplication. The existing degree of acidity is an unknown quantity until\r\na careful test has been made. There are soils so sour that several tons\r\nof fresh burned lime per acre would only meet present requirement, and\r\nthere are soils so soundly alkaline that they need none at all. This\r\nuncertainty regarding amount required is responsible for much failure to\r\ndo anything, even when some acidity is indicated by general appearance.\r\n\r\n_A Working Basis._ If land has once been productive and in later years\r\nclover has ceased to grow and grass sods are thin, there is a strong\r\nprobability that liming will pay, and the experience of farmers on\r\nnormal soils, and the tests of experiment stations, justify the\r\nestimate that two tons of fine stone, or one and a quarter tons of fresh\r\nburned lime per acre, can be used with profit. This amount probably will\r\npermit fertilizers and tillage to make their full return in heavy sods\r\nthat will provide humus. It is a reasonable expectation that the\r\napplication will serve through a crop rotation of four or five years.\r\n\r\nIf the soil was not very sour, the second application at the end of four\r\nor five years may be reduced somewhat, and even a ton of stone given\r\nonce in the crop rotation may fully meet the requirement.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the normal soil that has ceased to grow clover, and does\r\ngrow plants that are acid-resistant, it is better practice to secure a\r\nrelatively low-priced supply of coarsely pulverized stone and apply\r\nthree or four tons per acre, and thus lengthen the interval between\r\napplications to eight or 10 years. The fine material in the heavy\r\napplication will take care of present need, and the coarser particles\r\nwill disintegrate later on.\r\n\r\nThe quantities suggested may not be the most economical for the reader,\r\nbut their use cannot be attended by loss if a soil is sour, and there\r\nis reason to believe that it is much better to use such quantities\r\nwithout question than to defer liming for a year in the hope that some\r\nmore definite knowledge of a particular field's needs may be secured.\r\n\r\n_Small Amounts Per Acre._ There is much experience as a basis for the\r\nclaim that a few hundred pounds of burned lime per acre may have marked\r\nresults. Fields that indicated an actual lime requirement of a ton of\r\nfresh lime per acre have had a test of 500 pounds per acre made in\r\nstrips, and the clover later on was so superior to that which was\r\nstruggling to live in the untreated portion that the light application\r\nappeared almost to be adequate. In such land there cannot be full\r\nbacterial activity or continuing friendliness to plants unless the need\r\nis met fully. A larger application would have paid better. It is the\r\nsoil rich in lime that can make the best response to tillage and\r\nfertilization.\r\n\r\n_A Heavy Soil._ When burned lime is not high in price, an application of\r\ntwo tons per acre may be more profitable than a smaller one. A heavy\r\nsoil needs to be richer in lime than a light one for best results, and\r\nphysical condition also is improved by the larger quantity. A\r\ncorrespondingly heavy coat of stone will give quite satisfactory\r\nresults, but effect upon the texture of the soil is less marked.\r\n\r\n_Sandy Soils._ It is inadvisable to apply any large quantity of caustic\r\nlime to a light soil. Such a soil does not need as high a percentage in\r\nit as a heavy soil requires for good results, and caustic lime can\r\neasily injure physical condition. Limestone is safe for use, and is to\r\nbe advised for all quite sandy land. Acidity rarely runs high in a light\r\nsoil, and the opinion is hazarded here that one ton of stone per acre\r\nmeets the needs of a light soil about as surely as two tons supply a\r\nheavy soil. In case of each type of soil there are wide exceptions, and\r\nyet these estimates form a basis for the judgment of the individual\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSPECIAL CROP DEMANDS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lime-Loving Crops._ There are plants which are acid-resistant, giving a\r\ngood return for fertilization and care when the soil is sour. There are\r\na few kinds of cultivated plants that seem to prefer an acid soil, and\r\nto resent lime applications. Most staple crops prefer an alkaline soil,\r\nor at least one that has no large requirement, and there are plants that\r\nthrive best only in land rich in lime. Not all such plants require more\r\nas a component part of their structure, but do have a high percentage in\r\ntheir ash.\r\n\r\n_Liming for Alfalfa._ When all other conditions are right, alfalfa\r\nthrives or fails according as a soil is rich in lime or is distinctly\r\ndeficient. It is entirely possible to get fair yields of this legume for\r\na short time from land that is not fully alkaline, but full yields and\r\nability to last for a term of years depend upon a liberal lime supply.\r\nAlfalfa is at home only in a naturally calcareous soil, or one that has\r\nbeen given some of the characteristics of such land by free use of\r\nlime. In the case of neutral or slightly acid ground it is good practice\r\nto mix four tons of limestone per acre thoroughly with the soil. Such\r\ntreatment gives greater permanence to the seeding, enabling the plants\r\nto compete successfully with the wild grasses and other weeds that are\r\nthe chief obstacle to success in the humid climate of our Mississippi\r\nvalley and eastern states. When this amount of stone is used, the finest\r\ngrade may not be preferred to material having a considerable percentage\r\nof slightly coarser grains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Remarkable Effect of Lime on Sweet Clover at the Ohio\r\nExperiment Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sweet Clover Thrives When Lime and Manure Are Supplied,\r\nOhio Experiment Station]\r\n\r\n_Red Clover._ When land is in excellent tilth, it may grow red clover\r\nsatisfactorily while showing a decided lime deficiency. On the other\r\nhand, much slightly acid land fails to grow clover, and an application\r\nof lime is followed by heavy growths. Red clover is most at home in\r\ncalcareous soils, and lack of lime is a leading cause of clover failure\r\nin this country. Other causes may be important ones in the absence of\r\nlime and be overcome when it is present.\r\n\r\n_Alsike Clover._ Most legumes like lime, and alsike clover is not an\r\nexception, but is far more acid-resistant than the red. It is less\r\nvaluable, both for soil improvement and for forage, having an inferior\r\nroot system, but has proved a boon to farmers in areas that have been\r\nlosing the power to grow red clover. The custom of mixing red and alsike\r\nseed has become widespread, and distinctly acid soils are marked in the\r\nclover flowering season by the profusion of the distinctive alsike bloom\r\nto the exclusion of the red. While there is acid-resistant power, this\r\nclover responds to liming.\r\n\r\n_Crimson Clover._ Among lime-loving plants crimson clover has a rightful\r\nplace, but it makes fairly good growth where the lack of lime is marked.\r\n\r\n_Bluegrass._ The heaviest bluegrass sods are found where lime is\r\nabundant in the soil. This most valuable pasture grass may withstand the\r\nencroachments of weeds for a long time when lime is not abundant, if\r\nplant food is not in scant supply, but dependable sods of this grass are\r\nmade only in an alkaline soil. Heavy liming of an acid soil pays when a\r\nseeding to permanent pasture is made, and old sods on land unfit for\r\ntillage may be given a new life by a dressing.\r\n\r\n_Crops Favored by Lime._ Nearly all staple farm crops respond to\r\napplications given acid soils. Corn, oats, timothy, potatoes and many\r\nother crops have considerable power of resistance to acids, but give\r\nincreased yields when lime is present. Liming is not recommended for\r\npotatoes because it furnishes conditions favorable to a disease which\r\nattacks this crop. When clover is wanted in a crop rotation with\r\npotatoes, it is advisable to apply the lime immediately after the potato\r\ncrop has been grown, and to use limestone rather than burned lime. Most\r\nkinds of vegetables thrive best in an alkaline soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n   Page\r\n\r\n   Air-slaked lime, composition and relative value of, 31, 57\r\n\r\n   Agricultural lime, composition and relative value of, 58, 76\r\n\r\n   Amount of lime per acre, 82\r\n\r\n   Basic slag, 76\r\n\r\n   Burning lime, methods of, 49\r\n\r\n   Calcium, 29\r\n     carbonate, 30\r\n     hydroxide, 30\r\n     oxide, 29\r\n\r\n   Carbon dioxide, 30\r\n\r\n   Causes of soil acidity, 10, 12, 13, 14\r\n\r\n   Caustic lime affects physical condition, 44, 46\r\n     acts on humus, 44, 47\r\n     frees inert plant food, 44\r\n     compared with limestone, 45\r\n     irrational use of, 44\r\n     may injure a sandy soil, 66, 85\r\n     right use of, 48\r\n\r\n   Caustic magnesian lime on sandy land, 66\r\n\r\n   Chemical changes produce acidity, 13\r\n\r\n   Clover, 17, 19, 87\r\n\r\n   Composition of limestone, 24, 30, 31, 46\r\n\r\n   Distribution of lime, 70, 78\r\n\r\n   Distributors, 80, 81\r\n\r\n   Dolomite, 30, 67\r\n\r\n   Equivalents in value, 69\r\n\r\n   Extent of soil acidity, 6, 11\r\n\r\n   Fineness of limestone, 39, 73\r\n\r\n   Frear, Dr. Wm., 50\r\n\r\n   Fresh burned lime, 44\r\n     composition and relative value of, 29, 31, 45, 69, 71\r\n\r\n   Gas lime, 62\r\n\r\n   Ground limestone, composition and relative value of, 30, 33, 69, 72\r\n\r\n   Hydrated lime, composition and relative value of 30, 31, 53, 71\r\n\r\n   Indications of soil acidity, 5, 15, 17, 18\r\n\r\n   Irrational use of lime, 9, 44\r\n\r\n   Land plaster, 76\r\n\r\n   Leaching, 12, 38\r\n\r\n   Lime for alfalfa, 86\r\n     alsike clover, 87\r\n     bluegrass, 88\r\n     crimson clover, 88\r\n     potatoes, 89\r\n     red clover, 87\r\n     most staple crops, 88\r\n     in fertilizers, 77\r\n     is unstable, 10\r\n     necessary content variable, 5\r\n     on sandy soils, 85\r\n\r\n   Limestone burned to effect distribution, 34\r\n     land, value of, 4, 6\r\n     varies in composition, 33\r\n\r\n   Litmus paper test, 20\r\n\r\n   Low-priced pulverizers, 35\r\n\r\n   Lump lime and hydrate compared, 71\r\n     limestone compared, 72\r\n\r\n   Magnesian lime, 64\r\n     limestone, 66\r\n\r\n   Magnesium, 30, 64\r\n\r\n   Marl, composition and relative value of, 59, 76\r\n\r\n   New York experiment station, 42\r\n\r\n   Old heaps of burned lime, 58\r\n\r\n   Oyster shells, composition and relative value of, 61, 75\r\n\r\n   Redtop, 18\r\n\r\n   Relative values of lime, 68, 71, 72\r\n\r\n   Removal of lime in crops, 14\r\n\r\n   Slaking lime, 53\r\n\r\n   Small applications may pay, 84\r\n\r\n   Soil acidity, cause of, 10, 12, 13, 14\r\n     extent of, 6, 11\r\n     indications of, 5, 15, 17, 18\r\n     tests for, 20, 21\r\n\r\n   Soils vary in lime requirement, 82\r\n\r\n   Sorrel and plantain, 15\r\n\r\n   Spreading farm-burned lime, 70, 80\r\n\r\n   Storing lime in the soil, 38\r\n\r\n   Storing limestone, 73\r\n\r\n   Source of lime, as:\r\n     agricultural lime, 58, 76\r\n     air-slaked lime, 31, 57\r\n     fresh-burned lime, 29, 31, 44\r\n     gas lime, 62\r\n     ground lime, 31\r\n     ground limestone, 30, 33\r\n     hydrated or slaked lime, 31, 53\r\n     magnesian limestone, 30\r\n     marl, 59\r\n     oyster shells, 61, 75\r\n     wood ashes, 61, 75\r\n\r\n   Source of lime in soils, 10, 24\r\n\r\n   Technical terms, 28\r\n\r\n   Tests for soil acidity, 20, 21\r\n\r\n   Thin soils usually acid, 18\r\n\r\n   Timber as an index, 7, 15\r\n\r\n   Timothy, 17, 88\r\n\r\n   Truog, Prof. E., 21\r\n\r\n   Truog test, 21\r\n\r\n   Value of lime after magnesium removal, 62\r\n\r\n   Voorhees, Dr. E.
