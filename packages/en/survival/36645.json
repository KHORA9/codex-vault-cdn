The change has been a rapid one from the free range\r\nto the fenced pasture; the open ranges turned into farms and\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of changed conditions, the rancher of restricted\r\nterritory and reduced herds ceased to be an important factor in directly\r\nsupplying the market, as he was forced to utilize the land that was not\r\ndesirable for homesteaders, and the pasturage being insufficient to\r\nsuitably fatten stock, he was compelled to ship his cattle to the\r\nfeeders of the Middle West to prepare them for market.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Middle West, or corn-belt states, being unable to raise\r\ncattle in an economical way, developed into a feeding station, where\r\nyoung cattle from the Western ranges were shipped to be fattened and\r\nprepared for the market.\r\n\r\nWith the decrease of range cattle, year by year, fewer Western beeves\r\nreach the corn belt to be finished and made ready for market.\r\n\r\nThe early settlers of Southern Louisiana raised cattle after the fashion\r\nthat prevailed on the plains of Texas; that is, great herds without care\r\nor attention of any kind increased and multiplied and were annually\r\nrounded up and marketed; the returns were virtually all profit, as the\r\ncattle found their sustenance entirely in the luxuriant natural\r\npasturage.\r\n\r\nWith the change of conditions in the cattle-growing world, Louisiana\r\nbegan the improvement of its herds, so that today there are thousands\r\nof highly bred cattle in the state, equal to the best that can be found\r\nanywhere.\r\n\r\nIn a consideration of any branch of the live stock industry, a review of\r\nthe world-wide conditions becomes necessary to establish a standard of\r\ncomparison between the industry in a given locality as against all other\r\nlocalities, and such a review at the present time shows an international\r\nshortage of beef cattle that even threatens famine.\r\n\r\nThe day of nondescript cattle of inferior quality is rapidly passing.\r\nThrough breeding, they are being steadily supplanted by higher grade,\r\nperfectly developed animals which yield the proper proportions of lean\r\nand fat, whose meat is tender, nutritious and palatable.\r\n\r\nThe Old World breeds have been improved and perfected, through the skill\r\nof the American grower, until American stock has become the standard of\r\nthe whole world, from the standpoint of excellence in every particular.\r\n\r\nThere are a multitude of reasons why it will never be possible for the\r\ngrowers of the Eastern Hemisphere, with the exception of Great Britain\r\nand the Scandinavian countries, to successfully compete with the United\r\nStates in bringing the standard of their beef cattle up to the high\r\npoint already attained in this country.\r\n\r\nNo longer ago than ten years, cattle were not acceptable as collateral\r\nexcept by banks in the Western cattle centers.\r\n\r\nToday, cattle are standard collateral for loans, approved by the\r\nTreasury of the United States Government and acceptable everywhere, as\r\ncattle are as good as gold all over the world; and a cattle enterprise\r\nmanaged with ability and integrity is the safest business known.\r\n\r\nThere are diseases to which cattle are subject; but these, like the\r\ndiseases to which mankind is subject, are now controlled by science, and\r\ncan be quickly eradicated, even though a foothold is once gained; and\r\nthat a foothold should be gained at all is as much beyond the bounds of\r\nreason as that the cities of New York and Chicago should, in this\r\nadvanced age, be devastated by a scourge of cholera, smallpox, yellow\r\nfever, or what not.\r\n\r\nAccording to official estimates of the United States Government, in 1910\r\nthere were 41,178,000 head of beef cattle in the United States, having a\r\nvalue of $785,261,000, while on January 1, 1917, there were 40,849,000\r\nhead of beef cattle, having a value of $1,465,786,000; a decrease in\r\nsupply, but an increase in value, within seven years, of 86.66 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn addition to superior natural conditions, the United States, on\r\naccount of the great distance to other countries where cattle can be\r\nraised successfully, is protected against competition, at all times and\r\nunder all conditions.\r\n\r\nThe United States for a quarter of a century was the world's greatest\r\nexport nation, and this trade has fallen off only in recent times,\r\nbecause of the shortage at home.\r\n\r\nOur export business well illustrates the changing conditions in the\r\ncattle industry, and the record of live cattle exported from Chicago is\r\na notable example, namely:\r\n\r\n                                Cattle\r\n  Exports in 1905               321,301\r\n  Exports in 1912                23,006\r\n  Exports in 1913                   260\r\n  Exports in 1914                   182\r\n\r\nThis table shows that the export trade was virtually extinct a year\r\nbefore the European War began; and if revived, it will be because of\r\nexorbitant prices brought about by the abnormal European demand, due to\r\nthe depletion of the cattle herds abroad.\r\n\r\nOfficial statistics show that prior to the European War 90.55 per cent\r\nof all the European cattle were within the boundaries of the\r\nnow-belligerent countries.\r\n\r\nThe records at that time, covering both beef cattle and dairy-herds,\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n  Russia                        36,237,000\r\n  Germany                       20,944,000\r\n  Austria-Hungary               17,787,883\r\n  France                        12,286,849\r\n  United Kingdom                12,030,789\r\n  Turkey                         6,726,000\r\n  Italy                          6,198,861\r\n  Rumania                        2,667,000\r\n  Belgium                        1,831,000\r\n\r\nEven prior to the war, the world-supply of cattle was diminishing, and\r\nnow the herds of these nations, representing nine-tenths of the European\r\nsupply, are depleted as never before, while the one-tenth remaining\r\nsupply of the neighboring neutral nations is reduced by the drafts of\r\nthe warring powers.\r\n\r\nThe immense demand in recent years has caused the marketing of vast\r\nnumbers of the best improved cattle in the United States, including\r\ngreat inroads upon the breeding herds, as cattle growers have marketed\r\ntheir stock without regard to the future, looking solely to the large\r\nimmediate profits.\r\n\r\nThe depletion and deterioration of the breeding herds is a source of\r\ngreat danger, as it cannot fail to result in a still further decrease in\r\nproduction, and threatens to seriously impair the meat supply of the\r\nAmerican people.\r\n\r\nAs an infinitely worse condition prevails in the other cattle-producing\r\ncountries of the world, it is obvious that we cannot look to any\r\noutside source of supply, either to replenish our herds, or to provide\r\nour meat food requirements.\r\n\r\nThe increased cost of production in the North has resulted in the great\r\nadvancement of the dairying industry, to meet the American food\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nIn 1850 the milch cows on American farms numbered about 6,000,000. This\r\nnumber was increased to 8,500,000 in 1860, and to about 13,000,000 in\r\n1880; and the census of 1900 showed 17,100,000. In 1907, they numbered\r\n20,625,000, and January 1, 1917, 22,768,000, or more than one-third of\r\nour entire cattle herds.\r\n\r\nThe change from beef-cattle raising to dairying is most noticeable in\r\nthe Eastern and the North Central States, where the lack of pasturage\r\nand the increased cost of forage make the production of beef less\r\nprofitable than formerly, while the proximity to large centers of\r\npopulation and great cities has greatly stimulated the demand for dairy\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country dairying has encroached to such an\r\nextent on the beef cattle industry that the latter has ceased to be a\r\nfactor of importance in those localities.\r\n\r\nThe beef cattle industry of the North is divided into two departments:\r\nfirst, producing in the Far West; second, preparing for market in the\r\nMiddle West.\r\n\r\nThe Western producer can only provide grazing, and must then ship to the\r\nMiddle West feeder, who raises the corn with which he prepares the\r\ncattle for market.\r\n\r\nThe shortness of the grazing season makes it impossible to put a\r\nthousand-pound beef on the market in a year; consequently the stock must\r\nbe shipped to the Middle West in September, October or November, to be\r\nfattened and prepared for the market.\r\n\r\nThe breeding herds and the stock not ready for shipment to the feeders\r\nof the Middle West exist on the thin grasses, through eight\r\nmonths--from September to June.\r\n\r\nThese sections of arid soil and thin vegetation are further handicapped\r\nby the winters of intense cold, and of enforced housing and feeding;\r\nfor, during six or seven months, and even eight months, of each year,\r\nthere is scant vegetation to support animal life, and the struggle is a\r\nsevere one to sustain life itself against the encroachments of the\r\nbitter temperature which so long prevails.\r\n\r\nIf the Middle West farmer should go into cattle-raising, his position\r\nwould be almost identical with that of the cattle grower of the Far\r\nWest, as his pasturage would be exhausted in October, and it would be\r\nnecessary to feed the cattle until May; otherwise, his loss would be\r\ntremendous through partial starvation and exposure to inclement weather,\r\nand he could not count upon the survival of more than 75 per cent of his\r\nherd from one pasturing season to the next.\r\n\r\nThe farmer of the Middle West has six months of open weather, which must\r\nbe devoted exclusively to planting, cultivating and harvesting his corn\r\ncrop, and this crop takes up his land, leaving no acreage available for\r\nsummer pasturage.\r\n\r\nHe produces corn in the summer, and begins feeding in the fall.\r\nAccording to the quality of cattle received from the Far West, he feeds\r\n60, 90, and up to 120 days, when they are ready for market, and,\r\naccording to the old saying, are \"corn sold on the hoof.\"\r\n\r\nEven the adoption of intensive methods does not enable the Northern\r\ngrower to successfully compete with the Southern grower, because\r\nproduction in the North is limited to one-half the year, and the other\r\nhalf is wholly unproductive, during which period his stores are being\r\nconsumed, without any returns whatever.\r\n\r\nTo house cattle during the winter is scarcely better than to leave them\r\nexposed to the rigors of climate, as confinement brings the scourge of\r\ntuberculosis; whereas in the South, and wherever life is spent in the\r\nopen, cattle enjoy immunity from this plague.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the year-round supply of green food in the South is\r\nnaturally conducive to the health and well-being of all animals, whereas\r\nin the North, for several months in the year, only concentrated food is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n\"The South, with her short, mild winters, and her abundance of grasses,\r\ncan grow young cattle cheaper than the North.\"--W. J. Spillman, Chief of\r\nthe Bureau of Farm Management, United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\nA mild climate, luxuriant pastures, a great variety of forage crops, a\r\nyear-round supply of green food, and living outdoors all the year, are\r\nthe factors that make Southern Louisiana the ideal cattle-raising\r\nsection of the United States.\r\n\r\nJames Wilson, former Secretary of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture, at the National Live Stock Show held in New Orleans in\r\n1916, said:\r\n\r\n\"You have as fine domestic animals in the State of Louisiana today as\r\nyou will find anywhere; the finest breeds of cattle--Holstein and\r\nothers, as well as American breeds of Herefords, which are an\r\nimprovement over the English Hereford.\"\r\n\r\nIn the corn belt the lands are not so productive in grains and pasture\r\ncrops as the alluvial lands of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn the North the growing season for crops does not exceed six months; in\r\nLouisiana the productive period is twelve months.\r\n\r\nIn Northern states, animals can be pastured in the fields during six or\r\nseven months only; in Louisiana the animals may pasture in the open the\r\nwhole year.\r\n\r\nIn the North, extensive and costly barns and equipment are essential for\r\nwinter shelter and feeding, and vast quantities of grain, hay, ensilage,\r\nand other foods, must be raised and stored, as the period of\r\nwinter-feeding extends over six months; in Louisiana, open sheds facing\r\nsouth provide all the shelter needed, as aside from cold rains at\r\nintervals during February or March, there are no rigors of climate.\r\n\r\nCareful estimates by farm experts, and by authorities on cattle, place\r\nthe cost of production in Louisiana at less than 60 per cent of the cost\r\nin the most favored corn-belt states.\r\n\r\nThere is no winter here, as understood in the North. Frost is a rarity,\r\nfrequently being absent for several years, and is never severe; the\r\nrainfall is well distributed and averages 60 inches a year; extremes of\r\ntemperature are very rare; the average for January is 59 degrees, and\r\nfor July, 82 degrees, over the Gulf Coast area of Southern Louisiana;\r\nand vegetation flourishes the year round.\r\n\r\nThe cost of summer feeding in Southern Louisiana, as compared with\r\nsummer feeding in the corn-belt states, shows a difference of about 25\r\nper cent in favor of the former.\r\n\r\nIn winter feeding, the difference is altogether in favor of Louisiana.\r\nFurthermore, practically none of the food consumed here is required to\r\nkeep up the animal heat, whereas 30 per cent of the food given Northern\r\ncattle during the winter is absorbed by this requirement alone.\r\n\r\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture, the cost of\r\nensilage in the Northern states ranges from $1.50 to $4 per ton, and it\r\nis generally conceded that corn ensilage in the Middle West costs an\r\naverage of $2.50 per ton.\r\n\r\nOn the alluvial lands of Southern Louisiana it has been proved that\r\nensilage can be produced at 50 cents to $1.50 per ton, and the yield\r\nper acre is two crops of ten to twenty tons each, as against one crop of\r\nfive to ten tons in the North.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Bureau of Plant Industry, the best bluegrass pastures\r\nof the North will carry only one head of cattle to two acres for about\r\nsix months of the year; whereas on the alluvial lands of Louisiana,\r\nBermuda grass and lespedeza combined forms permanent pasture which will\r\ncarry several head of cattle ten months on a single acre.\r\n\r\nWith a network of waterways and railroads, nearer the great consuming\r\nmarkets of the East than any other important cattle-growing section, and\r\nbut a short distance from Chicago and the important markets of the\r\nMiddle States, Southern Louisiana occupies a strategic commercial\r\nposition of great money-value to those who raise cattle, as well as\r\nother products.\r\n\r\nOut of six thousand members of the American Hereford Society, a grower\r\nfrom the Gulf Coast took the greatest number of prizes for a herd of\r\nHereford cattle, and also took the grand championship prize for a\r\nHereford bull, against the whole of the United States, which shows the\r\nmerit of this section of country.\r\n\r\nThe market today requires quality, and experience has proved that the\r\ngreatest profit comes through producing quality.\r\n\r\nThe day of the inferior, lightweight animal, which was marketed at two\r\nto three and one-half years old, has passed.\r\n\r\nThe requirement now is for high-grade, one-year-old stock, weighing an\r\naverage of 1,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThis stock can be produced in Louisiana under organized methods, at a\r\ncost of 4-1/2 cents per pound, delivered at the market, and will bring a\r\nprice of 10 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Civil War the best talent in America was devoted to\r\nagricultural pursuits, which offered the greatest opportunity for making\r\nlarge wealth--as wealth was counted in those days.\r\n\r\nAfterward came the manufacturing era, which attracted the genius of the\r\ncountry and brought about the perfection of methods and combinations in\r\nalmost every known line, with the result that no longer is there any\r\ngeneral field of opportunity therein.\r\n\r\nAnother era has now arrived, which again focuses the minds of thinking\r\nmen upon the greatest of all problems--supplying the human race with\r\nfood--because of the imperative need of increasing the world's food\r\nsupply, and because of the large profit therein.\r\n\r\nIn the United States today, the production of live stock is the greatest\r\nfield of opportunity open to men of brains and capital; and it is, above\r\nall, the one industry that now attracts the genius of men of large\r\naffairs, and the great aggregations of capital.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the average price of beef cattle in the principal markets of\r\nthis country was $4.40 per hundredweight; in 1900, it had increased to\r\n$5.80; in 1907 the average was $7.60; in 1910, $8.85; in 1911, $9.35; in\r\n1912, $10.25; in 1915, $11.60; and in 1916, about $11.90 per\r\nhundredweight.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing market prices tell the story of the cattle industry from a\r\nfinancial standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe following prices paid in 1901 and in 1916 for prize-winning\r\nexhibition beeves--at the International Live Stock Exposition held\r\nannually in Chicago, at the Union Stock Yards--well illustrate the trend\r\nof the cattle market:\r\n\r\nIn 1901, the Grand Champion carload of fat cattle was two-year-old\r\nstock, weighing an average of 1,497 pounds, and sold in the auction ring\r\nat $12 per hundredweight.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, the Grand Champion carload of fat cattle was one-year-old\r\nstock, weighing an average of 1,146 pounds, and sold in the auction ring\r\nat $28 per hundredweight.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, the Grand Champion Steer was two years old, weighed 1,600\r\npounds, and sold in the auction ring at 50 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nIn 1916, the Grand Champion Steer was one year old, weighed 1,120\r\npounds, and sold in the auction ring at $1.75 per pound.\r\n\r\nThe following top prices were paid in the auction ring of the Exposition\r\nfor \"show cattle\" of various weights:\r\n\r\n    Cattle Weighing      Price in    Per Hundredweight\r\n\r\n   900 to 1050 pounds      1901          $ 8.70\r\n   900 to 1050 pounds      1916           17.75\r\n  1050 to 1200 pounds      1901            9.50\r\n  1050 to 1200 pounds      1916           28.00\r\n  1200 to 1350 pounds      1901            8.75\r\n  1200 to 1350 pounds      1916           20.00\r\n  1350 to 1500 pounds      1901           12.00\r\n  1350 to 1500 pounds      1916           18.50\r\n  1500 to 1900 pounds      1901            9.30\r\n  1500 to 1900 pounds      1916           15.75\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Text in italics is enclosed with underscores: _italics_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Louisiana Beef Cattle, by William Carter Stubbs",
