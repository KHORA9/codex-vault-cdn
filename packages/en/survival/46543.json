This is the complete Series of this\r\nPublication, under the above Authors and Artists. There are 161 finely\r\ncolored plates of Birds previously unfigured or little known, or\r\nnondescript. A few of the plates have more than one Species represented.\r\nFrom 1 to 4 pages of text accompanies each plate; an Index of the 1st 2\r\nvols. is given. The last vol. was abruptly ended. A page of explanation\r\nis bound at the end of the 3rd vol., in which it is “proposed to carry\r\non a New Series of these Illus.” It states also that the New Series will\r\nbe published early in 1836, which would give the approximate date of the\r\nlast vol. of this Series as 1835. Probably begun in 1832; as a complete\r\nset like this of this Series of Illustrations is excessively rare, and\r\nno record has been found of it being sold. Many of the New Species are\r\nAmerican. Several of the Anatidæ are figured. Condition and binding very\r\nfine, corners and edges of vols. somewhat rubbed and need a little\r\ntouching up. Edinburgh, Published by W. H.

Original\r\nParchment Articles of Agreement, made Nov. 10, 1851, between Capt. J. C.\r\nFremont, of the City of San Francisco, California, and Solomon Alter,\r\nJohn L. Newbold, John M. Lisle, Chas. Schaffer, and Francis N. Buck, of\r\nPhila. This Agreement recites that said Fremont for the sum of $250,000,\r\n“hath demised, leased and let two certain Lots, Parcels or Measurement\r\nof Mineral Land,” etc. The Document then describes this Land, first as\r\nthe “_Heap and Sargent Location_” on the Mariposa River. Also, another\r\nknown as “_The New Britain Location_,” situated between the Mariposa and\r\nthe Ave Maria Rivers, together called the _Mariposas_, purchased by\r\nFremont from Don Juan B. Alvarado, Ex-Gov. of California. The term of\r\nthis Lease is for Ten Years with Privilege and Extension up to the year\r\n1871. This Parchment document, measuring 25½ × 21½ inches is duly signed\r\nand witnessed by all the parties above named. On the back is sketched a\r\nmap in colors of the above Purchase, showing the Location of all the\r\nHouses and Tents in the Town of Mariposas, and of Old-town, on the\r\nopposite side of the Mariposas River. It states that the Large Tract was\r\ngranted by General Micheltorena, Gov. of California, to the aforesaid\r\nAlvarado, Ex-Gov. It further shows the “_Locations of the Philadelphia\r\nand California Mining Co._” This map was filed and recorded by R. S.\r\nMiller, Recorder of Mariposa Co. It was “drawn by A. Zakreski, Clay St.,\r\nabove the Plaza.” The Possession of this Lease may afford considerable\r\nsatisfaction to the present owners of this Old Claim!\r\n                                                                 $110.00\r\n\r\n626.

Quite a number of species are indicated as\r\n_new_, and given binomials, followed by “_Nobis_,” in the Plate Indexes.\r\nWith exception of the deficiency noted in “L. Arche de Noë,” vol. 6, the\r\nset is complete, as listed, including all the finely engraved\r\nTitle-pages and Indexes.
