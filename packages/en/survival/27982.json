The scene opens with several small\r\nvessels drifting about on the ocean.  There had been a fire, followed\r\nby an explosion aboard a vessel carrying slaves.  Most of the crew were\r\npretty nasty people, but there were two pairs of people who become the\r\nheroes of this story.  One of these is Ben Brace and a sixteen year old\r\nboy seaman, whom he had rescued from being eaten by the thirty or so\r\ncrew members who had found enough spars, timber, sails, ropes and\r\nbarrels to construct a large raft, though rather badly made, because\r\nthese men were consoling themselves with a rum-barrel.  At a distance\r\nfloated the ship's gig, with the captain, the mate, the carpenter and\r\nthree other men.  Finally, there is a construction, hardly more than a\r\nlarge barrel, containing Snowball, an African ship's cook of the\r\nCoromantee tribe, together with a little girl of eight or ten.  Luckily\r\nthese get together with Ben Brace and the boy William, and it is their\r\nadventures that the story is mainly about.  The author is a natural\r\nhistorian, and he tells us lots of interesting things about the fish\r\nand other denizens of the deep.  Naturally the whole thing comes right\r\nin the end, with the wicked perishing, and the good being picked up\r\nby a whale-ship.\r\n________________________________________________________________________\r\nTHE OCEAN WAIFS, BY CAPTAIN MAYNE REID.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE ALBATROSS.\r\n\r\nThe \"vulture of the sea,\" borne upon broad wing, and wandering over the\r\nwide Atlantic, suddenly suspends his flight to look down upon an object\r\nthat has attracted his attention.\r\n\r\nIt is a raft, with a disc not much larger than a dining-table,\r\nconstructed out of two small spars of a ship,--the dolphin-striker and\r\nspritsail yard,--with two broad planks and some narrower ones lashed\r\ncrosswise, and over all two or three pieces of sail-cloth carelessly\r\nspread.\r\n\r\nSlight as is the structure, it is occupied by two individuals,--a man\r\nand a boy.  The latter is lying along the folds of the sail-cloth,\r\napparently asleep.  The man stands erect, with his hand to his forehead,\r\nshading the sun from his eyes, and scanning the surface of the sea with\r\ninquiring glances.\r\n\r\nAt his feet, lying among the creases of the canvas, are a handspike, a\r\npair of boat oars, and an axe.  Nothing more is perceptible of the raft,\r\neven to the keen eye of the albatross.\r\n\r\nThe bird continues its flight towards the west.  Ten miles farther on it\r\nonce more poises itself on soaring wing, and directs its glance\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\nAnother raft is seen motionless upon the calm surface of the sea, but\r\ndiffering from the former in almost everything but the name.  It is\r\nnearly ten times as large; constructed out of the masts, yards, hatches,\r\nportions of the bulwarks, and other timbers of a ship; and rendered\r\nbuoyant by a number of empty water-casks lashed along its edges.  A\r\nsquare of canvas spread between two extemporised masts, a couple of\r\ncasks, an empty biscuit-box, some oars, handspikes, and other maritime\r\nimplements, lie upon the raft; and around these are more than thirty\r\nmen, seated, standing, lying,--in short, in almost every attitude.\r\n\r\nSome are motionless, as if asleep; but there is that in their prostrate\r\npostures, and in the wild expression of their features, that betokens\r\nrather the sleep of intoxication.  Others, by their gestures and loud,\r\nriotous talk, exhibit still surer signs of drunkenness; and the tin cup,\r\nreeking with rum, is constantly passing from hand to hand.  A few,\r\napparently sober, but haggard and hungry-like, sit or stand erect upon\r\nthe raft, casting occasional glances over the wide expanse, with but\r\nslight show of hope, fast changing to despair.\r\n\r\nWell may the sea-vulture linger over this group, and contemplate their\r\nmovements with expectant eye.  The instincts of the bird tell him, that\r\nere long he may look forward to a bountiful banquet!\r\n\r\nTen miles farther to the west, though unseen to those upon the raft, the\r\nfar-piercing gaze of the albatross detects another unusual object upon\r\nthe surface of the sea.  At this distance it appears only a speck not\r\nlarger than the bird itself, though in reality it is a small boat,--a\r\nship's gig,--in which six men are seated.  There has been no attempt to\r\nhoist a sail; there is none in the gig.  There are oars, but no one is\r\nusing them.  They have been dropped in despair; and the boat lies\r\nbecalmed just as the two rafts.  Like them, it appears to be adrift upon\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nCould the albatross exert a reasoning faculty it would know that these\r\nvarious objects indicated a wreck.  Some vessel has either foundered and\r\ngone to the bottom, or has caught fire and perished in the flames.\r\n\r\nTen miles to the eastward of the lesser raft might be discovered truer\r\ntraces of the lost ship.  There might be seen the _debris_ of charred\r\ntimbers, telling that she has succumbed, not to the storm, but to fire;\r\nand the fragments, scattered over the circumference of a mile, disclose\r\nfurther that the fire ended abruptly in some terrible explosion.\r\n\r\nUpon the stern of the gig still afloat may be read the name _Pandora_.\r\nThe same word may be seen painted on the water-casks buoying up the big\r\nraft; and on the two planks forming the transverse pieces of the lesser\r\none appears _Pandora_ in still larger letters: for these were the boards\r\nthat exhibited the name of the ship on each side of her bowsprit, and\r\nwhich had been torn off to construct the little raft by those who now\r\noccupy it.\r\n\r\nBeyond doubt the lost ship was the _Pandora_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nSHIP ON FIRE.\r\n\r\nThe story of the _Pandora_ has been told in all its terrible details.  A\r\nslave-ship, fitted out in England, and sailing from an English port,--\r\nalas! not the only one by scores,--manned by a crew of ruffians, scarce\r\ntwo of them owning to the same nationality.  Such was the bark\r\n_Pandora_.\r\n\r\nHer latest and last voyage was to the slave coast, in the Gulf of\r\nGuinea.  There, having shipped five hundred wretched beings with black\r\nskins,--\"bales\" as they are facetiously termed by the trader in human\r\nflesh,--she had started to carry her cargo to that infamous market,--\r\never open in those days to such a commodity,--the barracoons of Brazil.\r\n\r\nIn mid-ocean she had caught fire,--a fire that could not be\r\nextinguished.  In the hurry and confusion of launching the boats the\r\npinnace proved to be useless; and the longboat, stove in by the falling\r\nof a cask, sank to the bottom of the sea.  Only the gig was found\r\navailable; and this, seized upon by the captain, the mate, and four\r\nothers, was rowed off clandestinely in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the crew, over thirty in number, succeeded in constructing a\r\nraft; and but a few seconds after they had pushed off from the sides of\r\nthe ship, a barrel of gunpowder ignited by the flames, completed the\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\nBut what became of the _cargo_?  Ah! that is indeed a tale of horror.\r\n\r\nUp to the last moment those unfortunate beings had been kept under\r\nhatches, under a grating that had been fastened down with battens.  They\r\nwould have been left in that situation to be stifled in their\r\nconfinement by the suffocating smoke, or burnt alive amid the blazing\r\ntimbers, but for one merciful heart among those who were leaving the\r\nship.  An axe uplifted by the arm of a brave youth--a mere boy--struck\r\noff the confining cleats, and gave the sable sufferers access to the\r\nopen air.\r\n\r\nAlas! it was scarce a respite to these wretched creatures,--only a\r\nchoice between two modes of death.  They escaped from the red flames but\r\nto sink into the dismal depths of the ocean,--hundreds meeting with a\r\nfate still more horrible: for there were not less than that number, and\r\nall became the prey of those hideous sea-monsters, the sharks.\r\n\r\nOf all that band of involuntary emigrants, in ten minutes after the\r\nblowing up of the bark, there was not one above the surface of the sea!\r\nThose of them that could not swim had sunk to the bottom, while a worse\r\nfate had befallen those that could,--to fill the maws of the ravenous\r\nmonsters that crowded the sea around them!  At the period when our tale\r\ncommences, several days had succeeded this tragical event; and the\r\ngroups we have described, aligned upon a parallel of latitude, and\r\nseparated one from another by a distance of some ten or a dozen miles,\r\nwill be easily recognised.\r\n\r\nThe little boat lying farthest west was the gig of the _Pandora_,\r\ncontaining her brutal captain, his equally brutal mate, the carpenter,\r\nand three others of the crew, that had been admitted as partners in the\r\nsurreptitious abstraction.  Under cover of the darkness they had made\r\ntheir departure; but long before rowing out of gun-shot they had heard\r\nthe wild denunciations and threats hurled after them by their betrayed\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nThe ruffian crew occupied the greater raft; but who were the two\r\nindividuals who had intrusted themselves to that frail embarkation,--\r\nseemingly so slight that a single breath of wind would scatter it into\r\nfragments, and send its occupants to the bottom of the sea?  Such in\r\nreality would have been their fate, had a storm sprung up at that\r\nmoment; but fortunately for them the sea was smooth and calm,--as it had\r\nbeen ever since the destruction of the ship.\r\n\r\nBut why were they thus separated from the others of the crew: for both\r\nman and boy had belonged to the forecastle of the _Pandora_?\r\n\r\nThe circumstance requires explanation, and it shall be briefly given.\r\nThe man was Ben Brace,--the bravest and best sailor on board the\r\nslave-bark, and one who would not have shipped in such a craft but for\r\nwrongs he had suffered while in the service of his country, and that had\r\ninducted him into a sort of reckless disposition, of which, however, he\r\nhad long since repented.\r\n\r\nThe boy had also been the victim of a similar disposition.  Longing to\r\nsee foreign lands, he had _run away to sea_; and by an unlucky accident,\r\nthrough sheer ignorance of her character, had chosen the _Pandora_ in\r\nwhich to make his initiatory voyage.  From the cruel treatment he had\r\nbeen subjected to on board the bark, he had reason to see his folly.\r\nIrksome had been his existence from the moment he set foot on the deck\r\nof the _Pandora_; and indeed it would have been scarce endurable but for\r\nthe friendship of the brave sailor Brace, who, after a time, had taken\r\nhim under his especial protection.  Neither of them had any feelings in\r\ncommon with the crew with whom they had become associated; and it was\r\ntheir intention to escape from such vile companionship as soon as an\r\nopportunity should offer.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the bark would not have given that opportunity.  On\r\nthe contrary, it rendered it all the more necessary to remain with the\r\nothers, and share the chances of safety offered by the great raft.\r\nSlight as these might be, they were still better than those that might\r\nawait them, exposed on such a frail fabric as that they now occupied.\r\nIt is true, that upon this they had left the burning vessel separate\r\nfrom the others; but immediately after they had rowed up alongside the\r\nlarger structure, and made fast to it.\r\n\r\nIn this companionship they had continued for several days and nights,\r\nborne backward and forward by the varying breezes; resting by day on the\r\ncalm surface of the ocean; and sharing the fate of the rest of the\r\ncastaway crew.\r\n\r\nWhat had led to their relinquishing the companionship?  Why was Ben\r\nBrace and his _protege_ separated from the others and once more alone\r\nupon their little raft?\r\n\r\nThe cause of that separation must be declared, though one almost\r\nshudders to think of it.  It was to save the boy _from being eaten_ that\r\nBen Brace had carried him away from his former associates; and it was\r\nonly by a cunning stratagem, and at the risk of his own life, that the\r\nbrave sailor had succeeded in preventing this horrid banquet from being\r\nmade!\r\n\r\nThe castaway crew had exhausted the slender stock of provisions received\r\nfrom the wreck.  They were reduced to that state of hunger which no\r\nlonger revolts at the filthiest of food; and without even resorting to\r\nthe customary method adopted in such terrible crises, they unanimously\r\nresolved upon the death of the boy,--Ben Brace alone raising a voice of\r\ndissent!\r\n\r\nBut this voice was not heeded.  It was decided that the lad should die:\r\nand all that his protector was able to obtain from the fiendish crew,\r\nwas the promise of a respite for him till the following morning.\r\n\r\nBrace had his object in procuring this delay.  During the night, the\r\nunited rafts made way under a fresh breeze; and while all was wrapped in\r\ndarkness, he cut the ropes which fastened the lesser one to the greater,\r\nallowing the former to fall astern.  As it was occupied only by him and\r\nhis _protege_, they were thus separated from their dangerous associates;\r\nand when far enough off to run no risk of being heard, they used their\r\noars to increase the distance.\r\n\r\nAll night long did they continue to row against the wind; and as morning\r\nbroke upon them, they came to a rest upon the calm sea, unseen by their\r\nlate comrades, and with ten miles separating the two rafts from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt was the fatigue of that long spell of pulling--with many a watchful\r\nand weary hour preceding it--that had caused the boy to sink down upon\r\nthe folded canvas, and almost on the instant fall asleep; and it was the\r\napprehension of being followed that was causing Ben Brace to stand\r\nshading his eyes from the sun, and scan with uneasy glance the\r\nglittering surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE LORD'S PRAYER.\r\n\r\nAfter carefully scrutinising the smooth water towards every point of the\r\ncompass,--but more especially towards the west,--the sailor ceased from\r\nhis reconnoissance, and turned his eyes upon his youthful companion,\r\nstill soundly slumbering.\r\n\r\n\"Poor lad!\" muttered he to himself; \"he be quite knocked up.  No wonder,\r\nafter such a week as we've had o't.  And to think he war so near bein'\r\nkilled and ate by them crew o' ruffians.  I'm blowed if that wasn't\r\nenough to scare the strength out o' him!  Well, I dare say he's escaped\r\nfrom that fate; but as soon as he has got a little more rest, we must\r\ntake a fresh spell at the oars.  It 'ud never do to drift back to\r\n_them_.  If we do, it an't only him they'll want to eat, but me too,\r\nafter what's happened.  Blowed if they wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor paused a moment, as if reflecting upon the probabilities of\r\ntheir being pursued.\r\n\r\n\"Sartin!\" he continued, \"they could never fetch that catamaran against\r\nthe wind; but now that it's turned dead calm, they might clap on wi'\r\ntheir oars, in the hope of overtakin' us.  There's so many of them to\r\npull, and they've got oars in plenty, they might overhaul us yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Ben! dear Ben! save me,--save me from the wicked men!\"\r\n\r\nThis came from the lips of the lad, evidently muttered in his sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Dash my buttons, if he an't dreaming!\" said the sailor, turning his\r\neyes upon the boy, and watching the movements of his lips.  \"He be\r\ntalkin' in his sleep.  He thinks they're comin' at him just as they did\r\nlast night on the raft!  Maybe I ought to rouse him up.  If he be a\r\ndreamin' that way he'll be better awake.  It's a pity, too, for he an't\r\nhad enough sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! they will kill me and eat me.  Oh, oh!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they won't do neyther,--blow'd if they do.  Will'm, little Will'm!\r\nrouse yourself, my lad.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as he said this he bent down and gave the sleeper a shake.\r\n\r\n\"O Ben! is it you?  Where are they,--those monsters?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miles away, my boy.  You be only a dreamin' about 'em.  That's why I've\r\nshook you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you have waked me.  Oh! it was a frightful dream!  I thought\r\nthey had done it, Ben.\"\r\n\r\n\"Done what, Will'm?\"\r\n\r\n\"What they were going to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dash it, no, lad! they an't ate you yet; nor won't, till they've first\r\nput an end o' me,--that I promise ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear Ben,\" cried the boy, \"you are so good,--you've risked your life to\r\nsave mine.  Oh! how can I ever show you how much I am sensible of your\r\ngoodness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk o' that, little Will'm.  Ah! lad, I fear it an't much use to\r\neyther o' us.  But if we must die, anything before a death like that.\r\nI'd rather far that the sharks should get us than to be eat up by one's\r\nown sort.--Ugh! it be horrid to think o't.  But come, lad, don't let us\r\ndespair.  For all so black as things look, let us put our trust in\r\nProvidence.  We don't know but that His eye may be on us at this minute.\r\nI wish I knew how to pray, but I never was taught that ere.  Can you\r\npray, little Will'm?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can repeat the Lord's Prayer.  Would that do, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartain it would.  It be the best kind o' prayer, I've heerd say.  Get\r\non your knees, lad, and do it.  I'll kneel myself, and join with ye in\r\nthe spirit o' the thing, tho' I'm shamed to say I disremember most o'\r\nthe words.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy, thus solicited, at once raised himself into a kneeling\r\nposition, and commenced repeating the sublime prayer of the Christian.\r\nThe rough sailor knelt alongside of him, and with hands crossed over his\r\nbreast in a supplicating attitude, listened attentively, now and then\r\njoining in the words of the prayer, whenever some phrase recurred to his\r\nremembrance.\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, and the \"Amen\" had been solemnly pronounced by the\r\nvoices of both, the sailor seemed to have become inspired with a fresh\r\nhope; and, once more grasping an oar, he desired his companion to do the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n\"We must get a little farther to east'ard,\" said he, \"so as to make sure\r\no' bein' out o' their way.  If we only pull a couple of hours afore the\r\nsun gets hot, I think we'll be in no danger o' meetin' _them_ any more.\r\nSo let's set to, little Will'm!  Another spell, and then you can rest as\r\nlong's you have a mind to.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor seated himself close to the edge of the raft, and dropped his\r\noar-blade in the water, using it after the fashion of a canoe-paddle.\r\n\"Little Will'm,\" taking his place on the opposite side, imitated the\r\naction; and the craft commenced moving onward over the calm surface of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nThe boy, though only sixteen, was skilled in the use of an oar, and\r\ncould handle it in whatever fashion.  He had learnt the art long before\r\nhe had thought of going to sea; and it now stood him in good stead.\r\nMoreover, he was strong for his age, and therefore his stroke was\r\nsufficient to match that of the sailor, given more gently for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nPropelled by the two oars, the raft made way with considerable\r\nrapidity,--not as a boat would have done, but still at the rate of two\r\nor three knots to the hour.\r\n\r\nThey had not been rowing long, however, when a gentle breeze sprung up\r\nfrom the west, which aided their progress in the direction in which they\r\nwished to go.  One would have thought that this was just what they\r\nshould have desired.  On the contrary, the sailor appeared uneasy on\r\nperceiving that the breeze blew from the west.  Had it been from any\r\nother point he would have cared little about it.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like it a bit,\" said he, speaking across the raft to his\r\ncompanion.  \"It helps us to get east'ard, that's true; _but_ it'll help\r\nthem as well--and with that broad spread o' canvas they've rigged up,\r\nthey might come down on us faster than we can row.\"\r\n\r\n\"Could we not rig a sail too?\" inquired the boy.  \"Don't you think we\r\nmight, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the thing I war thinkin' o', lad; I dare say we can.  Let me see;\r\nwe've got that old tarpaulin and the lying jib-sail under us.  The\r\ntarpaulin itself will be big enough.  How about ropes?  Ah! there's the\r\nsheets of the jib still stickin' to the sail; and then there's the\r\nhandspike and our two oars.  The oars 'll do without the handspike.\r\nLet's set 'em up then, and rig the tarpaulin between 'em.\"\r\n\r\nAs the sailor spoke, he had risen to his feet; and after partially\r\ndrawing the canvas off from the planks and spars, he soon accomplished\r\nthe task of setting the two oars upright upon the raft.  This done, the\r\ntarpaulin was spread between them, and when lashed so as to lie taut\r\nfrom one to the other, presented a surface of several square yards to\r\nthe breeze,--quite as much sail as the craft was capable of carrying.\r\n\r\nIt only remained for them to look to the steering of the raft, so as to\r\nkeep it head on before the wind; and this could be managed by means of\r\nthe handspike, used as a rudder or steering-oar.\r\n\r\nLaying hold of this, and placing himself abaft of the spread tarpaulin,\r\nBen had the satisfaction of seeing that the sail acted admirably; and as\r\nsoon as its influence was fairly felt, the raft surged on through the\r\nwater at a rate of not less than five knots to the hour.\r\n\r\nIt was not likely that the large raft that carried the dreaded crew of\r\nwould-be cannibals was going any faster; and therefore, whatever\r\ndistance they might be off, there would be no great danger of their\r\ngetting any nearer.\r\n\r\nThis confidence being firmly established, the sailor no longer gave a\r\nthought to the peril from which he and his youthful comrade had escaped.\r\nFor all that, the prospect that lay before them was too terrible to\r\npermit their exchanging a word,--either of comfort or congratulation,--\r\nand for a long time they sat in a sort of desponding silence, which was\r\nbroken only by the rippling surge of the waters as they swept in pearly\r\nfroth along the sides of the raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nHUNGER.--DESPAIR.\r\n\r\nThe breeze proved only what sailors call a catspaw, rising no higher\r\nthan just to cause a ripple on the water, and lasting only about an\r\nhour.  When it was over, the sea again fell into a dead calm; its\r\nsurface assuming the smoothness of a mirror.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this the raft lay motionless, and the extemporised sail\r\nwas of no use for propelling it.  It served a purpose, however, in\r\nscreening off the rays of the sun, which, though not many degrees above\r\nthe horizon, was beginning to make itself felt in all its tropical\r\nfervour.\r\n\r\nBen no longer required his companion to take a hand at the oar.  Not but\r\nthat their danger of being overtaken was as great as ever; for although\r\nthey had made easterly some five or six knots, it was but natural to\r\nconclude that the great raft had been doing the same; and therefore the\r\ndistance between the two would be about as before.\r\n\r\nBut whether it was that his energy had become prostrated by fatigue and\r\nthe hopelessness of their situation, or whether upon further reflection\r\nhe felt less fear of their being pursued, certain it is he no longer\r\nshowed uneasiness about making way over the water; and after once more\r\nrising to his feet and making a fresh examination of the horizon, he\r\nstretched himself along the raft in the shade of the tarpaulin.\r\n\r\nThe boy, at his request, had already placed himself in a similar\r\nposition, and was again buried in slumber.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to see he can sleep,\" said Brace to himself, as he lay down\r\nalongside.  \"He must be sufferin' from hunger as bad as I am myself, and\r\nas long as he's asleep he won't feel it.  May be, if one could keep\r\nasleep they'd hold out longer, though I don't know 'bout that bein' so.\r\nI've often ate a hearty supper, and woke up in the mornin' as hungry as\r\nif I'm gone to my bunk without a bite.  Well, it an't no use o' me\r\ntryin' to sleep as I feel now, blow'd if it is!  My belly calls out loud\r\nenough to keep old Morphis himself from nappin', and there an't a morsel\r\no' anything.  More than forty hours have passed since I ate that last\r\nquarter biscuit.  I can think o' nothing but our shoes, and they be so\r\nsoaked wi' the sea-water, I suppose they'll do more harm than good.\r\nThey'll be sure to make the thirst a deal worse than it is, though the\r\nLord knows it be bad enough a'ready.  Merciful Father!--nothin' to\r\neat!--nothin' to drink!  O God, hear the prayer little Will'm ha' just\r\nspoken and I ha' repeated, though I've been too wicked to expect bein'\r\nheard, `_Give us this day our daily bread_'!  Ah! another day or two\r\nwithout it, an' we shall both be asleep forever!\"\r\n\r\nThe soliloquy of the despairing sailor ended in a groan, that awoke his\r\nyoung comrade from a slumber that was at best only transient and\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Ben?\" he asked, raising himself on his elbow, and looking\r\ninquiringly in the face of his protector.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing partikler, my lad,\" answered the sailor, who did not wish to\r\nterrify his companion with the dark thoughts which were troubling\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n\"I heard you groaning,--did I not?  I was afraid you had seen them\r\ncoming after us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear o' that,--not a bit.  They're a long way off, and in this calm\r\nsea they won't be inclined to stir,--not as long as the rum-cask holds\r\nout, I warrant; and when that's empty, they'll not feel much like movin'\r\nanywhere.  'Tan't for them we need have any fear now.\"\r\n\r\n\"O Ben!  I'm so hungry; I could eat anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, my poor lad; so could I.\"\r\n\r\n\"True! indeed you must be even hungrier than I, for you gave me more\r\nthan my share of the two biscuits.  It was wrong of me to take it, for\r\nI'm sure you must be suffering dreadfully.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough, Will'm; but a bit o' biscuit wouldn't a made no\r\ndifference.  It must come to the same thing in the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"To what, Ben?\" inquired the lad, observing the shadow that had\r\noverspread the countenance of his companion, which was gloomier than he\r\nhad ever seen it.\r\n\r\nThe sailor remained silent.  He could not think of a way to evade giving\r\nthe correct answer to the question; and keeping his eyes averted, he\r\nmade no reply.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you mean,\" continued the interrogator.  \"Yes, yes,--you\r\nmean that we must die!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Will'm,--not that; there's hope yet,--who knows what may turn\r\nup?  It may be that the prayer will be answered.  I'd like, lad, if\r\nyou'd go over it again.  I think I could help you better this time; for\r\nI once knew it myself,--long, long ago, when I was about as big as you,\r\nand hearin' you repeatin' it, it has come most o' it back into my\r\nmemory.  Go over it again, little Will'm.\"\r\n\r\nThe youth once more knelt upon the raft, and in the shadow of the spread\r\ntarpaulin repeated the Lord's Prayer,--the sailor, in his rougher voice,\r\npronouncing the words after him.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished, the latter once more rose to his feet, and for\r\nsome minutes stood scanning the circle of sea around the raft.\r\n\r\nThe faint hope which that trusting reliance in his Maker had inspired\r\nwithin the breast of the rude mariner exhibited itself for a moment upon\r\nhis countenance, but only for a moment.  No object greeted his vision,\r\nsave the blue, boundless sea, and the equally boundless sky.\r\n\r\nA despairing look replaced that transient gleam of hope, and, staggering\r\nback behind the tarpaulin, he once more flung his body prostrate upon\r\nthe raft.\r\n\r\nAgain they lay, side by side, in perfect silence,--neither of them\r\nasleep, but both in a sort of stupor, produced by their unspoken\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nFAITH.--HOPE.\r\n\r\nHow long they lay in this half-unconscious condition, neither took note.\r\nIt could not have been many minutes, for the mind under such\r\ncircumstances does not long surrender itself to a state of tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThey were at length suddenly roused from it,--not, however, by any\r\nthought from within,--but by an object striking on their external\r\nsenses, or, rather, upon the sense of sight.  Both were lying upon their\r\nbacks, with eyes open and upturned to the sky, upon which there was not\r\na speck of cloud to vary the monotony of its endless azure.\r\n\r\nIts monotony, however, was at that moment varied by a number of objects\r\nthat passed swiftly across their field of vision, shining and\r\nscintillating as if a flight of silver arrows had been shot over the\r\nraft.  The hues of blue and white were conspicuous in the bright\r\nsunbeams, and those gay-coloured creatures, that appeared to belong to\r\nthe air, but which in reality were denizens of the great deep, were at\r\nonce recognised by the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"A shoal o' flyin'-fish,\" he simply remarked, and without removing from\r\nhis recumbent position.\r\n\r\nThen at once, as if some hope had sprung up within him at seeing them\r\ncontinue to fly over the raft, and so near as almost to touch the\r\ntarpaulin, he added, starting to his feet as he spoke--\r\n\r\n\"What if I might knock one o' 'em down!  Where's the handspike?\"\r\n\r\nThe last interrogatory was mechanical, and put merely to fill up the\r\ntime; for as he gave utterance to it he reached towards the implement\r\nthat lay within reach of his hands, and eagerly grasping raised it\r\naloft.\r\n\r\nWith such a weapon it was probable that he might have succeeded in\r\nstriking down one of the winged swimmers that, pursued by the bonitos\r\nand albacores, were still leaping over the raft.  But there was a surer\r\nweapon behind him,--in the piece of canvas spread between the upright\r\noars; and just as the sailor had got ready to wield his huge club, a\r\nshining object flashed close to his eyes, whilst his ears were greeted\r\nby a glad sound, signifying that one of the vaulting fish had struck\r\nagainst the tarpaulin.\r\n\r\nOf course it had dropped down upon the raft: for there it was, flopping\r\nand bounding about among the folds of the flying-jib, far more taken by\r\nsurprise than Ben Brace, who had witnessed its mishap, or even little\r\nWilliam, upon whose face it had fallen, with all the weight of its\r\nwatery carcass.  If a bird in the hand be worth two in the bush, by the\r\nsame rule a fish in the hand should be worth two in the water, and more\r\nthan that number flying in the air.\r\n\r\nSome such calculation as this might have passed through the brain of Ben\r\nBrace; for, instead of continuing to hold his handspike high flourished\r\nover his head, in the hope of striking another fish, he suffered the\r\nimplement to drop down upon the raft; and stooping down, he reached\r\nforward to secure the one that had voluntarily, or, rather, should we\r\nsay, involuntarily, offered itself as a victim.\r\n\r\nAs it kept leaping about over the raft, there was just the danger that\r\nit might reach the edge of that limited area, and once more escape to\r\nits natural element.\r\n\r\nThis, however naturally desired by the fish, was the object which the\r\noccupants of the raft most desired to prevent; and to that end both had\r\ngot upon their knees, and were scrambling over the sail-cloth with as\r\nmuch eager earnestness as a couple of terriers engaged in a scuffle with\r\na harvest rat.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice little William had succeeded in getting the fish in his\r\nfingers; but the slippery creature, armed also with its spinous\r\nfin-wings, had managed each time to glide out of his grasp; and it was\r\nstill uncertain whether a capture might be made, or whether after all\r\nthey were only to be tantalised by the touch and sight of a morsel of\r\nfood that was never to pass over their palates.\r\n\r\nThe thought of such a disappointment stimulated Ben Brace to put forth\r\nall his energies, coupled with his greatest activity.  He had even\r\nresolved upon following the fish into the sea if it should prove\r\nnecessary,--knowing that for the first few moments after regaining its\r\nnatural element it would be more easy of capture.  But just then an\r\nopportunity was offered that promised the securing of the prey without\r\nthe necessity of wetting a stitch of his clothes.\r\n\r\nThe fish had been all the while bounding about upon the spread\r\nsail-cloth, near the edge of which it had now arrived.  But it was fated\r\nto go no farther, at least of its own accord; for Ben seeing his\r\nadvantage, seized hold of the loose selvage of the sail, and raising it\r\na little from the raft, doubled it over the struggling captive.  A stiff\r\nsqueeze brought its struggles to a termination; and when the canvas was\r\nlifted aloft, it was seen lying underneath, slightly flattened out\r\nbeyond its natural dimensions, and it is scarcely necessary to say, as\r\ndead as a herring.\r\n\r\nWhether right or no, the simple-minded seaman recognised in this\r\nseasonable supply of provision the hand of an overruling Providence; and\r\nwithout further question, attributed it to the potency of that prayer\r\ntwice repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Will'm, you see it, my lad, 'tis the answer to that wonderful\r\nprayer.  Let's go over it once more, by way o' givin' thanks.  He who\r\nhas sent meat can also gie us drink, even here, in the middle o' the\r\nbriny ocean.  Come, boy! as the parson used to say in church,--let us\r\npray!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this serio-comic admonition--meant, however, in all due\r\nsolemnity--the sailor dropped upon his knees, and, as before, echoed the\r\nprayer once more pronounced by his youthful companion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nFLYING-FISH.\r\n\r\nThe flying-fish takes rank as one of the most conspicuous \"wonders of\r\nthe sea,\" and in a tale essentially devoted to the great deep, it is a\r\nsubject deserving of more than a passing notice.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest periods of ocean travel, men have looked with\r\nastonishment upon a phenomenon not only singular at first sight, but\r\nwhich still remains unexplained, namely, a fish and a creature believed\r\nto be formed only for dwelling under water, springing suddenly above the\r\nsurface, to the height of a two-storey house, and passing through the\r\nair to the distance of a furlong, before falling back into its own\r\nproper element!\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the sight should cause surprise to the most\r\nindifferent observer, nor that it should have been long a theme of\r\nspeculation with the curious, and an interesting subject of\r\ninvestigation to the naturalist.\r\n\r\nAs flying-fish but rarely make their appearance except in warm\r\nlatitudes, few people who have not voyaged to the tropics have had an\r\nopportunity of seeing them in their flight.  Very naturally, therefore,\r\nit will be asked what kind of fish, that is, to what _species_ and what\r\n_genus_ the flying-fish belong.  Were there only one kind of these\r\ncurious creatures the answer would be easier.  But not only are there\r\ndifferent species, but also different \"genera\" of fish endowed with the\r\nfaculty of flying, and which from the earliest times and in different\r\nparts of the world have equally received this characteristic\r\nappellation.  A word or two about each sort must suffice.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, there are two species belonging to the genus _Trigla_, or\r\nthe Gurnards, to which Monsieur La Cepede has given the name of\r\n_Dactylopterus_.\r\n\r\nOne species is found in the Mediterranean, and individuals, from a foot\r\nto fifteen inches in length, are often taken by the fishermen, and\r\nbrought to the markets of Malta, Sicily, and even to the city of Rome.\r\nThe other species of flying gurnard occur in the Indian Ocean and the\r\nseas around China and Japan.\r\n\r\nThe true _flying-fish_, however, that is to say, those that are met with\r\nin the great ocean, and most spoken of in books, and in the \"yarns\" of\r\nthe sailor, are altogether of a different kind from the gurnards.  They\r\nare not only different in genus, but in the family and even the order of\r\nfishes.  They are of the genus _Exocetus_, and in form and other\r\nrespects have a considerable resemblance to the common pike.  There are\r\nseveral species of them inhabiting different parts of the tropical seas;\r\nand sometimes individuals, in the summer, have been seen as far north as\r\nthe coast of Cornwall in Europe, and on the banks of Newfoundland in\r\nAmerica.  Their natural habitat, however, is in the warm latitudes of\r\nthe ocean; and only there are they met with in large \"schools,\" and seen\r\nwith any frequency taking their aerial flight.\r\n\r\nFor a long time there was supposed to be only one, or at most two,\r\nspecies of the _Exocetus_; but it is now certain there are several--\r\nperhaps as many as half a dozen--distinct from each other.  They are all\r\nmuch alike in their habits,--differing only in size, colour, and such\r\nlike circumstances.\r\n\r\nNaturalists disagree as to the character of their flight.  Some assert\r\nthat it is only a leap, and this is the prevailing opinion.  Their\r\nreason for regarding it thus is, that while the fish is in the air there\r\ncannot be observed any movement of the wings (pectoral fins); and,\r\nmoreover, after reaching the height to which it attains on its first\r\nspring, it cannot afterwards rise higher, but gradually sinks lower till\r\nit drops suddenly back into the water.\r\n\r\nThis reasoning is neither clear nor conclusive.  A similar power of\r\nsuspending themselves in the air, without motion of the wings is\r\nwell-known to belong to many birds,--as the vulture, the albatross, the\r\npetrels, and others.  Besides, it is difficult to conceive of a leap\r\ntwenty feet high and two hundred yards long; for the flight of the\r\n_Exocetus_ has been observed to be carried to this extent, and even\r\nfarther.  It is probable that the movement partakes both of the nature\r\nof leaping and flying: that it is first begun by a spring up out of the\r\nwater,--a power possessed by most other kinds of fish,--and that the\r\nimpulse thus obtained is continued by the spread fins acting on the air\r\nafter the fashion of parachutes.  It is known that the fish can greatly\r\nlighten the specific gravity of its body by the inflation of its\r\n\"swim-bladder,\" which, when perfectly extended, occupies nearly the\r\nentire cavity of its abdomen.  In addition to this, there is a membrane\r\nin the mouth which can be inflated through the gills.  These two\r\nreservoirs are capable of containing a considerable volume of air; and\r\nas the fish has the power of filling or emptying them at will, they no\r\ndoubt play an important part in the mechanism of its aerial movement.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain, that the flying-fish can turn while in the air,--\r\nthat is, diverge slightly from the direction first taken; and this would\r\nseem to argue a capacity something more than that of a mere spring or\r\nleap.  Besides, the wings make a perceptible noise,--a sort of\r\nrustling,--often distinctly heard; and they have been seen to open and\r\nclose while the creature is in the air.\r\n\r\nA shoal of flying-fish might easily be mistaken for a flock of white\r\nbirds, though their rapid movements, and the glistening sheen of their\r\nscales--especially when the sun is shining--usually disclose their true\r\ncharacter.  They are at all times a favourite spectacle, and with all\r\nobservers,--the old \"salt\" who has seen them a thousand times, and the\r\nyoung sailor on his maiden voyage, who beholds them for the first time\r\nin his life.  Many an hour of _ennui_ occurring to the ship-traveller,\r\nas he sits upon the poop, restlessly scanning the monotonous surface of\r\nthe sea, has been brought to a cheerful termination by the appearance of\r\na shoal of flying-fish suddenly sparkling up out of the bosom of the\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nThe flying-fish appear to be the most persecuted of all creatures.  It\r\nis to avoid their enemies under water that they take _fin_ and mount\r\ninto the air; but the old proverb, \"out of the frying-pan into the\r\nfire,\" is but too applicable in their case, for in their endeavours to\r\nescape from the jaws of dolphins, albicores, bonitos, and other petty\r\ntyrants of the sea, they rush into the beaks of gannets, boobies,\r\nalbatrosses, and other petty tyrants of the sky.\r\n\r\nMuch sympathy has been felt--or at all events expressed--for these\r\npretty and apparently innocent little victims.  But, alas! our sympathy\r\nreceives a sad shock, when it becomes known that the flying-fish is\r\nhimself one of the petty tyrants of the ocean,--being, like his near\r\ncongener, the pike, a most ruthless little destroyer and devourer of any\r\nfish small enough to go down his gullet.\r\n\r\nBesides the two _genera_ of flying-fish above described, there are\r\ncertain other marine animals which are gifted with a similar power of\r\nsustaining themselves for some seconds in the air.  They are often seen\r\nin the Pacific and Indian oceans, rising out of the water in shoals,\r\njust like the _Exoceti_: and, like them, endeavouring to escape from the\r\nalbicores and bonitos that incessantly pursue them.  These creatures are\r\nnot fish in the true sense of the word, but \"molluscs,\" of the genus\r\n_Loligo_; and the name given to them by the whalers of the Pacific is\r\nthat of \"Flying Squid.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA CHEERING CLOUD.\r\n\r\nThe particular species of flying-fish that had fallen into the clutches\r\nof the two starving castaways upon the raft was the _Exocetus evolans_,\r\nor \"Spanish flying-fish\" of mariners,--a well-known inhabitant of the\r\nwarmer latitudes of the Atlantic.  Its body was of a steel-blue, olive\r\nand silvery white underneath, with its large pectoral fins (its wings)\r\nof a powdered grey colour.  It was one of the largest of its kind, being\r\nrather over twelve inches in length, and nearly a pound in weight.\r\n\r\nOf course, it afforded but a very slight meal for two hungry stomachs,--\r\nsuch as were those of Ben Brace and his boy companion.  Still it helped\r\nto strengthen them a little; and its opportune arrival upon the raft--\r\nwhich they could not help regarding as providential--had the further\r\neffect of rendering them for a time more cheerful and hopeful.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say that they ate the creature without cooking\r\nit; and although under ordinary circumstances this might be regarded as\r\na hardship, neither was at that moment in the mood to be squeamish.\r\nThey thought the dish dainty enough.  It was its quantity--not the\r\nquality--that failed to give satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIndeed the flying-fish is (when cooked, of course) one of the most\r\ndelicious of morsels,--a good deal resembling the common herring when\r\ncaught freshly, and dressed in a proper manner.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, however, as if the partial relief from hunger only aggravated\r\nthe kindred appetite from which the occupants of the raft had already\r\nbegun to suffer.  Perhaps the salt-water, mingled with the saline juices\r\nof the fish, aided in producing this effect.  In any case, it was not\r\nlong after they had eaten the _Exocetus_ before both felt thirst in its\r\nvery keenest agony.\r\n\r\nExtreme thirst, under any circumstances, is painful to endure; but under\r\nno conditions is it so excruciating as in the midst of the ocean.  The\r\nsight of water which you may not drink,--the very proximity of that\r\nelement,--so near that you may touch it, and yet as useless to the\r\nassuaging of thirst as if it was the parched dust of the desert,--\r\nincreases rather than alleviates the appetite.  It is to no purpose,\r\nthat you dip your fingers into the briny flood, and endeavour to cool\r\nyour lips and tongue by taking it into the mouth.  To swallow it is\r\nstill worse.  You might as well think to allay thirst by drinking liquid\r\nfire.  The momentary moistening of the mouth and tongue is succeeded by\r\nan almost instantaneous parching of the salivary glands, which only glow\r\nwith redoubled ardour.\r\n\r\nBen Brace knew this well enough; and once or twice that little William\r\nlifted the sea-water on his palm and applied it to his lips, the sailor\r\ncautioned him to desist, saying that it would do him more harm than\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nIn one of his pockets Ben chanced to have a leaden bullet, which he gave\r\nthe boy, telling him to keep it in his mouth and occasionally to chew\r\nit.  By this means the secretion of the saliva was promoted; and\r\nalthough it was but slight, the sufferer obtained a little relief.\r\n\r\nBen himself held the axe to his lips, and partly by pressing his tongue\r\nagainst the iron, and partly by gnawing the angle of the blade,\r\nendeavoured to produce the same effect.\r\n\r\nIt was but a poor means of assuaging that fearful thirst that was now\r\nthe sole object of their thoughts,--it might be said their only\r\nsensation,--for all other feelings, both of pleasure or pain, had become\r\noverpowered by this one.  On food they no longer reflected, though still\r\nhungry; but the appetite of hunger, even when keenest, is far less\r\npainful than that of thirst.  The former weakens the frame, so that the\r\nnervous system becomes dulled, and less sensible of the affliction it is\r\nenduring; whereas the latter may exist to its extremest degree, while\r\nthe body is in full strength and vigour, and therefore more capable of\r\nfeeling pain.\r\n\r\nThey suffered for several hours, almost all the time in silence.  The\r\nwords of cheer which the sailor had addressed to his youthful comrade\r\nwere now only heard occasionally, and at long intervals, and when heard\r\nwere spoken in a tone that proclaimed their utterance to be merely\r\nmechanical, and that he who gave tongue to them had but slight hope.\r\nLittle as remained, however, he would rise from time to time to his\r\nfeet, and stand for a while scanning the horizon around him.  Then as\r\nhis scrutiny once more terminated in disappointment, he would sink back\r\nupon the canvas, and half-kneeling, half-lying, give way for an interval\r\nto a half stupor of despair.\r\n\r\nFrom one of these moods he was suddenly aroused by circumstances which\r\nhad made no impression on his youthful companion, though the latter had\r\nalso observed it.  It was simply the darkening of the sun by a cloud\r\npassing over its disc.\r\n\r\nLittle William wondered that an incident of so common character should\r\nproduce so marked an effect as it had done upon his protector: for the\r\nlatter on perceiving that the sun had become shadowed instantly started\r\nto his feet, and stood gazing up towards the sky.  A change had come\r\nover his countenance.  His eyes, instead of the sombre look of despair\r\nobservable but the moment before, seemed now to sparkle with hope.  In\r\nfact, the cloud which had darkened the face of the sun appeared to have\r\nproduced the very opposite effect upon the face of the sailor!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nA CANVAS TANK.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Ben?\" asked William, in a voice husky and hoarse, from the\r\nparched throat through which it had to pass.  \"You look pleased like; do\r\nyou see anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see that, boy,\" replied the sailor, pointing up into the sky.\r\n\r\n\"What?  I see nothing there except that great cloud that has just passed\r\nover the sun.  What is there in that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, what is there in't?  That's just what I'm tryin' to make out,\r\nWill'm; an' if I'm not mistaken, boy, there's it 't the very thing as we\r\nboth wants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Water!\" gasped William, his eyes lighting up with gleam of hope.  \"A\r\nrain-cloud you think, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a'most sure o't, Will'm.  I never seed a bank o' clouds like them\r\nthere wasn't some wet in; and if the wind 'll only drift 'em this way,\r\nwe may get a shower 'll be the savin' o' our lives.  O Lord! in thy\r\nmercy look down on us, and send 'em over us!\"\r\n\r\nThe boy echoed the prayer.\r\n\r\n\"See!\" cried the sailor.  \"The wind is a fetchin' them this way.\r\nYonder's more o' the same sort risin' up in the west, an' that's the\r\ndirection from which it's a-blowin'.  Ho!  As I live, Will'm, there's\r\nrain.  I can see by the mist it's a-fallin' on the water yonder.  It's\r\nstill far away,--twenty mile or so,--but that's nothing; an' if the wind\r\nholds good in the same quarter, it _must_ come this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if it did, Ben,\" said William, doubtingly, \"what good would it do\r\nus?  We could not drink much of the rain as it falls, and you know we\r\nhave nothing in which to catch a drop of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have, boy,--we have our clothes and our shirts.  If the rain\r\ncomes, it will fall like it always does in these parts, as if it were\r\nspillin' out o' a strainer.  We'll be soakin' wet in five minutes' time;\r\nand then we can wring all out,--trousers, shirts, and every rag we've\r\ngot.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have no vessel, Ben,--what could we wring the water into?\"\r\n\r\n\"Into our months first: after that--ah! it be a pity.  I never thought\r\no't.  We won't be able to save a drop for another time.  Any rate, if we\r\ncould only get one good quenchin', we might stand it several days\r\nlonger.  I fancy we might catch some fish, if we were only sure about\r\nthe water.  Yes, the rain's a-comin' on.  Look at yon black clouds; and\r\nsee, there's lightning forkin' among 'em.  That 's a sure sign it's\r\nraining.  Let's strip, and spread out our shirts so as to have them\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nAs Ben uttered this admonition he was about proceeding to pull off his\r\npea-jacket, when an object came before his eyes causing him to desist.\r\nAt the same instant an exclamatory phrase escaping from his lips\r\nexplained to his companion why he had thus suddenly changed his\r\nintention.  The phrase consisted of two simple words, which written as\r\npronounced by Ben were, \"Thee tarpolin.\"\r\n\r\nLittle William knew it was \"the tarpauling\" that was meant.  He could\r\nnot be mistaken about that; for, even had he been ignorant of the\r\nsailor's pronunciation of the words, the latter at that moment stood\r\npointing to the piece of tarred canvas spread upright between the oars;\r\nand which had formerly served as a covering for the after-hatch of the\r\n_Pandora_.  William did not equally understand why his companion was\r\npointing to it.\r\n\r\nHe was not left long in ignorance.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to catch the water in?  That's what you sayed, little Will'm?\r\nWhat do ye call that, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" replied the lad, catching at the idea of the sailor.  \"You mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean, boy, that there's a vessel big enough to hold gallons,--a dozen\r\no' 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it would hold water?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure o't, lad.  For what else be it made waterproof?  I helped tar\r\nit myself not a week ago.  It'll hold like a rum-cask, I warrant,--ay,\r\nan' it'll be the very thing to catch it too.  We can keep it spread out\r\na bit wi' a hollow place in the middle, an' if it do rain, there then,--\r\nmy boy, we'll ha' a pool big enough to swim ye in.  Hurrah! it's sure to\r\nrain.  See yonder.  It be comin' nearer every minute.  Let's be ready\r\nfor it.  Down wi' the mainsail.  Let go the sheets,--an' instead o'\r\nspreadin' our canvas to the wind, as the song says, we'll stretch it out\r\nto the rain.  Come, Will'm, let's look alive!\"\r\n\r\nWilliam had by this time also risen to his feet; and both now busied\r\nthemselves in unlashing the cords that had kept the hatch-covering\r\nspread between the two oars.\r\n\r\nThis occupied only a few seconds of time; and the tarpauling soon lay\r\ndetached between the extemporised masts, that were still permitted to\r\nremain as they had been \"stepped.\"\r\n\r\nAt first the sailor had thought of holding the piece of tarred canvas in\r\ntheir hands; but having plenty of time to reflect, a better plan\r\nsuggested itself.  So long as it should be thus held, they would have no\r\nchance of using their hands for any other purpose; and would be in a\r\ndilemma as to how they should dispose of the water after having\r\n\"captured it.\"\r\n\r\nIt did not require much ingenuity to alter their programme for the\r\nbetter.  By means of the flying-jib that lay along the raft, they were\r\nenabled to construct a ridge of an irregular circular shape; and then\r\nplacing the tarpauling upon the top, and spreading it out so that its\r\nedges lapped over this ridge, they formed a deep concavity or \"tank\" in\r\nthe middle, which was capable of holding many gallons of water.\r\n\r\nIt only remained to examine the canvas, and make sure there were no\r\nrents or holes by which the water might escape.  This was done with all\r\nthe minuteness and care that the circumstances called for; and when the\r\nsailor at length became satisfied that the tarpauling was waterproof, he\r\ntook the hand of his youthful _protege_ in his own, and both kneeling\r\nupon the raft, with their faces turned towards the west watched the\r\napproach of those dark, lowering clouds, as if they had been\r\nbright-winged angels sent from the far sky to deliver them from\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nA PLEASANT SHOWER-BATH.\r\n\r\nThey had not much longer to wait.  The storm came striding across the\r\nocean; and, to the intense gratification of both man and boy, the rain\r\nwas soon falling upon them, as if a water-spout had burst over their\r\nheads.\r\n\r\nA single minute sufficed to collect over a quart within the hollow of\r\nthe spread tarpauling; and before that minute had transpired, both might\r\nhave been seen lying prostrate upon their faces with their heads\r\ntogether, near the centre of the concavity, and their lips close to the\r\ncanvas, sucking up the delicious drops, almost as fast as they fell.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they continued in this position, indulging in that cool\r\nbeverage sent them from the sky,--which to both appeared the sweetest\r\nthey had ever tasted in their lives.  So engrossed were they in its\r\nenjoyment, that neither spoke a word until several minutes had elapsed,\r\nand both had drunk to a surfeit.\r\n\r\nThey were by this time wet to the skin; for the tropic rain, falling in\r\na deluge of thick heavy drops, soon saturated their garments through and\r\nthrough.  But this, instead of being an inconvenience, was rather\r\nagreeable than otherwise, cooling their skins so long parched by the\r\ntorrid rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Little Will'm,\" said Ben, after swallowing about a gallon of the\r\nrain-water, \"didn't I say that He 'as sent us meat, in such good time\r\ntoo, could also gi' us som'at to drink?  Look there! water enow to last\r\nus for days, lad!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis wonderful!\" exclaimed the boy.  \"I am sure, Ben, that Providence\r\nhas done this.  Indeed, it must be true what I was often told in the\r\nSunday school,--that God is everywhere.  Here He is present with us in\r\nthe midst of this great ocean.  O, dear Ben, let's hope He will not\r\nforsake us now.  I almost feel sure, after what has happened to us, that\r\nthe hand of God will yet deliver us from our danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"I almost feel so myself,\" rejoined the sailor, his countenance resuming\r\nits wonted expression of cheerfulness.  \"After what's happened, one\r\ncould not think otherwise; but let us remember, lad, that He is up\r\naloft, an' has done so much for us, expecting us to do what we can for\r\nourselves.  He puts the work within our reach, an' then leaves us to do\r\nit.  Now here's this fine supply o' water.  If we was to let that go to\r\nloss, it would be our own fault, not his, an' we'd deserve to die o'\r\nthirst for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done, Ben?  How are we to keep it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what I'm thinkin' about.  In a very short while the rain\r\nwill be over.  I know the sort o' it.  It be only one o' these heavy\r\nshowers as falls near the line, and won't last more than half an hour,--\r\nif that.  Then the sun 'll be out as hot as ever, an' will lick up the\r\nwater most as fast as it fell,--that is, if we let it lie there.  Yes,\r\nin another half o' an hour that tarpolin would be as dry as the down\r\nupon a booby's back.\"\r\n\r\n\"O dear! what shall we do to prevent evaporating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jest give me a minute to consider,\" rejoined the sailor, scratching his\r\nhead, and putting on an air of profound reflection; \"maybe afore the\r\nrain quits comin' down, I'll think o' some way to keep it from\r\nevaporating; that's what you call the dryin' o' it up.\"\r\n\r\nBen remained for some minutes silent, in the thoughtful attitude he had\r\nassumed,--while William, who was equally interested in the result of his\r\ncogitations, watched his countenance with an eager anxiety.\r\n\r\nSoon a joyful expression revealed itself to the glance of the boy,\r\ntelling him that his companion had hit upon some promising scheme.\r\n\r\n\"I think I ha' got it, Will'm,\" said he; \"I think I've found a way to\r\nstow the water even without a cask.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have!\" joyfully exclaimed William.  \"How, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, boy, the tarpolin holds water as tight as if 'twere a\r\nglass bottle.  I tarred it myself,--that did I, an' as I never did my\r\nwork lubber-like, I done that job well.  Lucky I did, warn't it,\r\nWilliam?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was.\"\r\n\r\n\"That be a lesson for you, lad.  Schemin' work bean't the thing, you\r\nsee.  It comes back to cuss one; while work as be well did be often like\r\na blessin' arterward,--just as this tarpolin be now.  But see! as I told\r\nyou, the rain would soon be over.  There be the sun again, hot an' fiery\r\nas ever.  There ain't no time to waste.  Take a big drink, afore I put\r\nthe stopper into the bottle.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam, without exactly comprehending what his companion meant by the\r\nlast words, obeyed the injunction; and stretching forward over the rim\r\nof the improvised tank, once more placed his lips to the water, and\r\ndrank copiously.  Ben did the same for himself, passing several pints of\r\nthe fluid into his capacious stomach.\r\n\r\nThen rising to his feet with a satisfied air, and directing his\r\n_protege_ to do the same, he set about the stowage of the water.\r\n\r\nWilliam was first instructed as to the intended plan, so that he might\r\nbe able to render prompt and efficient aid; for it would require both of\r\nthem, and with all their hands, to carry it out.\r\n\r\nThe sailor's scheme was sufficiently ingenious.  It consisted in taking\r\nup first the corners of the tarpauling, then the edges all around, and\r\nbringing them together in the centre.  This had to be done with great\r\ncare, so as not to jumble the volatile fluid contained within the\r\ncanvas, and spill it over the selvage.  Some did escape, but only a very\r\nlittle; and they at length succeeded in getting the tarpauling formed\r\ninto a sort of bag, puckered around the mouth.\r\n\r\nWhile Ben with both arms held the gathers firm and fast, William passed\r\na loop of strong cord, that had already been made into a noose for the\r\npurpose, around the neck of the bag, close under Ben's wrists, and then\r\ndrawing the other end round one of the upright oars, he pulled upon the\r\ncord with all his might.\r\n\r\nIt soon tightened sufficiently to give Ben the free use of his hands;\r\nwhen with a fresh loop taken around the crumpled canvas, and after a\r\nturn or two to render it more secure, the cord was made fast.\r\n\r\nThe tarpauling now rested upon the raft, a distended mass, like the\r\nstomach of some huge animal coated with tar.  It was necessary, however,\r\nlest the water should leak out through the creases, to keep the top\r\nwhere it was tied, uppermost; and this was effected by taking a turn or\r\ntwo of the rope round the uppermost end of one of the oars, that had\r\nserved for masts, and there making a knot.  By this means the great\r\nwater-sack was held in such a position that, although the contents might\r\n\"bilge\" about at their pleasure, not a drop could escape out either at\r\nthe neck or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAltogether they had secured a quantity of water, not less than a dozen\r\ngallons, which Ben had succeeded in stowing to his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nTHE PILOT-FISH.\r\n\r\nThis opportune deliverance from the most fearful of deaths had inspired\r\nthe sailor with a hope that they might still, by some further\r\ninterference of Providence, escape from their perilous position.\r\nRelying on this hope, he resolved to leave no means untried that might\r\npromise to lead to its realisation.  They were now furnished with a\r\nstock of water which, if carefully hoarded, would last them for weeks.\r\nIf they could only obtain a proportionate supply of food, there would\r\nstill be a chance of their sustaining life until some ship might make\r\nits appearance,--for, of course, they thought not of any other means of\r\ndeliverance.\r\n\r\nTo think of food was to think of fishing for it.  In the vast reservoir\r\nof the ocean under and around them there was no lack of nourishing food,\r\nif they could only grasp it; but the sailor well knew that the shy,\r\nslippery denizens of the deep are not to be captured at will, and that,\r\nwith all the poor schemes they might be enabled to contrive, their\r\nefforts to capture even a single fish might be exerted in vain.\r\n\r\nStill they could try; and with that feeling of hopeful confidence which\r\nusually precedes such trials, they set about making preparations.\r\n\r\nThe first thing was to make hooks and lines.  There chanced to be some\r\npins in their clothing; and with these Ben soon constructed a tolerable\r\nset of hooks.  A line was obtained by untwisting a piece of rope, and\r\nrespinning it to the proper thickness; and then a float was found by\r\ncutting a piece of wood to the proper dimensions.  And for a sinker\r\nthere was the leaden bullet with which little William had of late so\r\nvainly endeavoured to allay the pangs of thirst.  The bones and fins of\r\nthe flying-fish--the only part of it not eaten--would serve for bait.\r\nThey did not promise to make a very attractive one; for there was not a\r\nmorsel of flesh left upon them; but Ben knew that there are many kinds\r\nof fish inhabiting the great ocean that will seize at any sort of\r\nbait,--even a piece of rag,--without considering whether it be good for\r\nthem or not.\r\n\r\nThey had seen fish several times near the raft, during that very day;\r\nbut suffering as they were from thirst more than hunger, and despairing\r\nof relief to the more painful appetite, they had made no attempt to\r\ncapture them.  Now, however, they were determined to set about it in\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\nThe rain had ceased falling; the breeze no longer disturbed the surface\r\nof the sea.  The clouds had passed over the canopy of the heavens,--the\r\nsky was clear, and the sun bright and hot as before.\r\n\r\nBen standing erect upon the raft, with the baited hook in his hand,\r\nlooked down into the deep blue water.\r\n\r\nEven the smallest fish could have been seen many fathoms below the\r\nsurface, and far over the ocean.\r\n\r\nWilliam on the other side of the raft was armed with hook and line, and\r\nequally on the alert.\r\n\r\nFor a long time their vigil was unrewarded.  No living thing came within\r\nview.  Nothing was under their eyes save the boundless field of\r\nultramarine,--beautiful, but to them, at that moment, marked only by a\r\nmiserable monotony.\r\n\r\nThey had stood thus for a full hour, when an exclamation escaping from\r\nthe lad, caused his companion to turn and look to the other side of the\r\nraft.\r\n\r\nA fish was in sight.  It was that which had drawn the exclamation from\r\nthe boy, who was now swinging his line in the act of casting it out.\r\n\r\nThe ejaculation had been one of joy.  It was checked on his perceiving\r\nthat the sailor did not share it.  On the contrary, a cloud came over\r\nthe countenance of the latter on perceiving the fish,--whose species he\r\nat once recognised.\r\n\r\nAnd why? for it was one of the most beautiful of the finny tribe.  A\r\nlittle creature of perfect form,--of a bright azure blue, with\r\ntransverse bands of deeper tint, forming rings around its body.  Why did\r\nBen Brace show disappointment at its appearance?\r\n\r\n\"You needn't trouble to throw out your line, little Will'm,\" said he,\r\n\"that ere takes no bait,--not it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Because it's something else to do than forage for itself.  I dare say\r\nits master an't far off.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That be the _pilot-fish_.  See! turns away from us.  It gone back to\r\nhim as has sent it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sent it!  Who, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"A shark, for sarten.  Didn't I tell ye?  Look yonder.  Two o' them, as\r\nI live; and the biggest kind they be.  Slash my timbers if I iver see\r\nsuch a pair!  They have fins like lug-sails.  Look! the pilot's gone to\r\nguide 'em.  Hang me if they bean't a-comin' this way!\"\r\n\r\nWilliam had looked in the direction pointed out by his companion.  He\r\nsaw the two great dorsal fins standing several feet above the water.  He\r\nknew them to be those of the _white shark_: for he had already seen\r\nthese dreaded monsters of the deep on more than one occasion.\r\n\r\nIt was true, as Ben had hurriedly declared.  The little pilot-fish,\r\nafter coming within twenty fathoms of the raft, had turned suddenly in\r\nthe water, and gone back to the sharks; and now it was seen swimming a\r\nfew feet in advance of them, as if in the act of leading them on!\r\n\r\nThe boy was struck with something in the tone of his companion's voice,\r\nthat led him to believe there was danger in the proximity of these ugly\r\ncreatures; and to say the truth, Ben did not behold them without a\r\ncertain feeling of alarm.  On the deck of a ship they might have been\r\nregarded without any fear; but upon a frail structure like that which\r\nsupported the castaways--their feet almost on a level with the surface\r\nof the water--it was not so very improbable that the sharks might attack\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nIn his experience the sailor had known cases of a similar kind.  It was\r\nno matter of surprise, that he should feel uneasiness at their approach,\r\nif not actual fear.\r\n\r\nBut there was no time left either for him to speculate as to the\r\nprobabilities of such an attack, or for his companion to question him\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the last words parted from his lips, when the foremost of\r\nthe two sharks was seen to lash the water with its broad forked tail,--\r\nand then coming on with a rush, it struck the raft with such a force as\r\nalmost to capsize it.\r\n\r\nThe other shark shot forward in a similar manner; but glancing a little\r\nto one side, caught in its huge mouth the end of the dolphin-striker,\r\ngrinding off a large piece of the spar as if it had been cork-wood!\r\n\r\nThis it swallowed almost instantaneously; and then turning once more in\r\nthe water appeared intent upon renewing the attack.\r\n\r\nBen and the boy had dropped their hooks and lines,--the former\r\ninstinctively arming himself with the axe, while the latter seized upon\r\nthe spare handspike.  Both stood ready to receive the second charge of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nIt was made almost on the instant.  The shark that had just attacked was\r\nthe first to return; and coming on with the velocity of an arrow, it\r\nsprang clear above the surface, projecting its hideous jaws over the\r\nedge of the raft.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the frail structure was in danger of being either capsized\r\nor swamped altogether, and then the fate of its occupants would\r\nundoubtedly have been to become \"food for sharks.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not the intention of Ben Brace or his youthful comrade to\r\nyield up their lives without striking a blow in self-defence, and that\r\ngiven by the sailor at once disembarrassed him of his antagonist.\r\n\r\nThrowing one arm around a mast, in order to steady himself, and raising\r\nthe light axe in the other, he struck outward and downward with all his\r\nmight.  The blade of the axe, guided with an unswerving arm, fell right\r\nupon the snout of the shark, just midway between its nostrils, cleaving\r\nthe cartilaginous flesh to the depth of several inches, and laying it\r\nopen to the bones.\r\n\r\nThere could not have been chosen a more vital part upon which to inflict\r\na wound; for, huge as is the white shark, and strong and vigorous as are\r\nall animals of this ferocious family, a single blow upon the nose with a\r\nhandspike or even a billet of wood, if laid on with a heavy hand, will\r\nsuffice to put an end to their predatory courses.\r\n\r\nAnd so was it with the shark struck by the axe of Ben Brace.  As soon as\r\nthe blow had been administered, the creature rolled over on its back;\r\nand after a fluke or two with its great forked tail, and a tremulous\r\nshivering through its body, it lay floating upon the water motionless as\r\na log of wood.\r\n\r\nWilliam was not so fortunate with his antagonist, though he had\r\nsucceeded in keeping it off.  Striking wildly out with the handspike in\r\na horizontal direction, he had poked the butt end of the implement right\r\nbetween the jaws of the monster, just as it raised its head over the\r\nraft with the mouth wide open.\r\n\r\nThe shark, seizing the handspike in its treble row of teeth, with one\r\nshake of its head whipped it out of the boy's hands: and then rushing on\r\nthrough the water, was seen grinding the timber into small fragments,\r\nand swallowing it as if it had been so many crumbs of bread or pieces of\r\nmeat.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds not a bit of the handspike could be seen,--save some\r\ntrifling fragments of the fibrous wood that floated on the surface of\r\nthe water; but what gave greater gratification to those who saw them,\r\nwas the fact that the shark which had thus made \"mince-meat\" of the\r\npiece of timber was itself no longer to be seen.\r\n\r\nWhether because it had satisfied the cravings of its appetite by that\r\nwooden banquet, or whether it had taken the alarm at witnessing the fate\r\nof its companion,--by much the larger of the two,--was a question of\r\nslight importance either to Ben Brace or to William.  For whatever\r\nreason, and under any circumstances, they were but too well pleased to\r\nbe disembarrassed of its hideous presence; and as they came to the\r\nconclusion that it had gone off for good, and saw the other one lying\r\nwith its white belly turned upwards upon the surface of the water--\r\nevidently dead as a herring--they could no longer restrain their voices,\r\nbut simultaneously raised them in a shout of victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nA LENTEN DINNER.\r\n\r\nThe shark struck upon the snout, though killed by the blow, continued to\r\nfloat near the surface of the water its fins still in motion as if in\r\nthe act of swimming.\r\n\r\nOne unacquainted with the habits of these sea-monsters might have\r\nsupposed that it still lived, and might yet contrive to escape.  Not so\r\nthe sailor, Ben Brace.  Many score of its kind had Ben coaxed to take a\r\nbait, and afterwards helped to haul over the gangway of a ship and cut\r\nto pieces upon the deck; and Ben knew as much about the habits of these\r\nvoracious creatures as any sailor that ever crossed the wide ocean, and\r\nmuch more than any naturalist that never did.  He had seen a shark drawn\r\naboard with a great steel hook in its stomach,--he had seen its belly\r\nripped up with a jack-knife, the whole of the intestines taken out, then\r\nonce more thrown into the sea; and after all this rough handling he had\r\nseen the animal not only move its fins, but actually swim off some\r\ndistance from the ship!  He knew, moreover, that a shark may be cut in\r\ntwain,--have the head separated from the body,--and still exhibit signs\r\nof vitality in both parts for many hours after the dismemberment!  Talk\r\nof the killing of a cat or an eel!--a shark will stand as much killing\r\nas twenty cats or a bushel of eels, and still exhibit symptoms of life.\r\n\r\nThe shark's most vulnerable part appears to be the snout,--just where\r\nthe sailor had chosen to make his hit; and a blow delivered there with\r\nan axe, or even a handspike, usually puts a termination to the career of\r\nthis rapacious tyrant of the great deep.\r\n\r\n\"I've knocked him into the middle o' next week,\" cried Ben, exultingly,\r\nas he saw the shark heel over on its side.  \"It ain't goin' to trouble\r\nus any more.  Where's the other un?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone out that way,\" answered the boy, pointing in the direction taken\r\nby the second and smaller of the two sharks.  \"He whipped the handspike\r\nout of my hands, and he's craunched it to fragments.  See! there are\r\nsome of the pieces floating on the water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lucky you let go, lad; else he might ha' pulled you from the raft.  I\r\ndon't think he'll come back again after the reception we've gi'ed 'em.\r\nAs for the other, it's gone out o' its senses.  Dash my buttons, if't\r\nain't goin' to sink!  Ha!  I must hinder that.  Quick, Will'm, shy me\r\nthat piece o' sennit: we must secure him 'fore he gives clean up and\r\ngoes to the bottom.  Talk o' catching fish wi' hook an' line!  Aha!\r\nThis beats all your small fry.  If we can secure it, we'll have fish\r\nenough to last us through the longest Lent.  There now! keep on the\r\nother edge of the craft so as to balance me.  So-so!\"\r\n\r\nWhile the sailor was giving these directions, he was busy with both\r\nhands in forming a running-noose on one end of the sennit-cord, which\r\nWilliam on the instant had handed over to him.  It was but the work of a\r\nmoment to make the noose; another to let it down into the water; a third\r\nto pass it over the upper jaw of the shark; a fourth to draw it taut,\r\nand tighten the cord around the creature's teeth.  The next thing done\r\nwas to secure the other end of the sennit to the upright oar; and the\r\ncarcass of the shark was thus kept afloat near the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nTo guard against a possible chance of the creature's recovery, Ben once\r\nmore laid hold of the axe; and, leaning over the edge of the raft,\r\nadministered a series of smart blows upon its snout.  He continued\r\nhacking away, until the upper jaw of the fish exhibited the appearance\r\nof a butcher's chopping-block; and there was no longer any doubt of the\r\ncreature being as \"dead as a herring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Will'm,\" said the shark-killer, \"this time we've got a fish\r\nthat'll gi'e us a fill, lad.  Have a little patience, and I'll cut ye a\r\nsteak from the tenderest part o' his body; and that's just forrard o'\r\nthe tail.  You take hold o' the sinnet, an' pull him up a bit,--so as I\r\ncan get at him.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy did as directed; and Ben, once more bending over the edge of the\r\nraft, caught hold of one of the caudal fins, and with his knife detached\r\na large flake from the flank of the fish,--enough to make an ample meal\r\nfor both of them.\r\n\r\nIt is superfluous to say that, like the little flying-fish, the\r\nshark-meat had to be eaten raw; but to men upon the verge of starvation\r\nthere is no inconvenience in this.  Indeed, there are many tribes of\r\nSouth-Sea Islanders--not such savage either--who habitually eat the\r\nflesh of the shark--both the blue and white species--without thinking it\r\nnecessary even to warm it over a fire!  Neither did the castaway English\r\nsailor nor his young comrade think it necessary.  Even had a fire been\r\npossible, they were too hungry to have stayed for the process of\r\ncooking; and both, without more ado, dined upon raw shark-meat.\r\n\r\nWhen they had succeeded in satisfying the cravings of hunger, and once\r\nmore refreshed themselves with a draught from their extemporised\r\nwater-bag, the castaways not only felt a relief from actual suffering,\r\nbut a sort of cheerful confidence in the future.  This arose from a\r\nconviction on their part, or at all events a strong impression, that the\r\nhand of Providence had been stretched out to their assistance.  The\r\nflying-fish, the shower, the shark may have been accidents, it is true;\r\nbut, occurring at such a time, just in the very crisis of their\r\naffliction, they were accidents that had the appearance of design,--\r\ndesign on the part of Him to whom in that solemn hour they had uplifted\r\ntheir voices in prayer.\r\n\r\nIt was under this impression that their spirits became naturally\r\nrestored; and once more they began to take counsel together about the\r\nways and means of prolonging their existence.\r\n\r\nIt is true that their situation was still desperate.  Should a storm\r\nspring up,--even an ordinary gale,--not only would their canvas\r\nwater-cask be bilged, and its contents spilled out to mingle with the\r\nbriny billow, but their frail embarkation would be in danger of going to\r\npieces, or of being whelmed fathoms deep under the frothing waves.  In a\r\nhigh latitude, either north or south, their chance of keeping afloat\r\nwould have been slight indeed.  A week, or rather only a single day,\r\nwould have been as long as they could have expected that calm to\r\ncontinue; and the experienced sailor knew well enough that anything in\r\nthe shape of a storm would expose them to certain destruction.  To\r\nconsole him for this unpleasant knowledge, however, he also knew that in\r\nthe ocean, where they were then afloat, storms are exceedingly rare, and\r\nthat ships are often in greater danger from the very opposite state of\r\nthe atmosphere,--from _calms_.  They were in that part of the Atlantic\r\nOcean known among the early Spanish navigators as the _Horse\r\nLatitudes_,--so-called because the horses at that time being carried\r\nacross to the New World, for want of water in the becalmed ships, died\r\nin great numbers, and being thrown overboard were often seen floating\r\nupon the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nA prettier and more poetical name have these same Spaniards given to a\r\nportion of the same Atlantic Ocean,--which, from the gentleness of its\r\nbreezes, they have styled \"_La Mar de las Damas_\" (the Ladies' Sea).\r\n\r\nBen Brace knew that in the Horse Latitudes storms were of rare\r\noccurrence; and hence the hopefulness with which he was now looking\r\nforward to the future.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer inactive.  If he believed in the special Interference\r\nof Providence, he also believed that Providence would expect him to make\r\nsome exertion of himself,--such as circumstances might permit and\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nFLENSING A SHARK.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the shark, and the stock of water so singularly obtained\r\nand so deftly stored away, might, if properly kept and carefully used,\r\nlast them for many days; and to the preservation of these stores the\r\nthoughts of the sailor and his young companion were now specially\r\ndirected.\r\n\r\nFor the former they could do nothing more than had been already done,--\r\nfurther than to cover the tarpauling that contained it with several\r\nfolds of the spare sail-cloth, in order that no ray of the sun should\r\nget near it.  This precaution was at once adopted.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the shark--now dead as mutton--if left to itself, would\r\nsoon spoil, and be unfit for food, even for starving men.  It was this\r\nreflection that caused the sailor and his _protege_ to take counsel\r\ntogether as to what might be done towards preserving it.\r\n\r\nThey were not long in coming to a decision.  Shark-flesh, like that of\r\nany other fish--like haddock, for instance, or red herrings--can be\r\ndried in the sun; and the more readily in that sun of the torrid zone\r\nthat shone down so hotly upon their heads.  The flesh only needed to be\r\ncut into thin slices and suspended from the upright oars.  The\r\natmosphere would soon do the rest.  Thus cured, it would keep for weeks\r\nor months; and thus did the castaways determine to cure it.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the plan conceived, than they entered upon its execution.\r\nLittle William again seized the cord of sennit, and drew the huge\r\ncarcass close up to the raft; while Ben once more opened the blade of\r\nhis sailor's knife, and commenced cutting off the flesh in broad\r\nflakes,--so thin as to be almost transparent.\r\n\r\nHe had succeeded in stripping off most of the titbits around the tail,\r\nand was proceeding up the body of the shark to _flense_ it in a similar\r\nfashion, when an ejaculation escaped him, expressing surprise or\r\npleasant curiosity.\r\n\r\nLittle William was but too glad to perceive the pleased expression on\r\nthe countenance of his companion,--of late so rarely seen.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Ben?\" he inquired, smilingly.\r\n\r\n\"Look 'ee theer, lad,\" rejoined the sailor, placing his hand upon the\r\nback of the boy's head, and pressing it close to the edge of the raft,\r\nso that he could see well down into the water,--\"look theer, and tell me\r\nwhat you see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asked William, still ignorant of the object to which his\r\nattention was thus forcibly directed.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see somethin' queery stickin' to the belly of the shark,--eh,\r\nlad?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I live,\" rejoined William, now perceiving \"somethin'\", \"there's a\r\nsmall fish pushing his head against the shark,--not so small either,--\r\nonly in comparison with the great shark himself.  It's about a foot\r\nlong, I should think.  But what is it doing in that odd position?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sticking to the shark,--didn't I tell 'ee, lad!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sticking to the shark?  You don't mean that, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do--mean that very thing, boy.  It's as fast theer as a barnacle\r\nto a ship's copper; an' 'll stay, I hope, till I get my claws upon it,--\r\nwhich won't take very long from now.  Pass a piece o' cord this way.\r\nQuick.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy stretched out his hand, and, getting hold of a piece of loose\r\nstring, reached it to his companion.  Just as the snare had been made\r\nfor the shark with the piece of sennit, and with like rapidity, a noose\r\nwas constructed on the string; and, having been lowered into the water,\r\nwas passed around the body of the little fish which appeared adhering to\r\nthe belly of the shark.  Not only did it so appear, but it actually was,\r\nas was proved by the pull necessary to detach it, and which required all\r\nthe strength that lay in the strong arms of the sailor.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded, however, in effecting his purpose; and with a pluck the\r\nparasite fish was separated from the skin to which it had been clinging,\r\nand, jerked upwards, was landed alive and kicking upon the raft.\r\n\r\nIts kicking was not allowed to continue for long.  Lest it might leap\r\nback into the water, and, sluggish swimmer as it was, escape out of\r\nreach, Ben, with the knife which he still held unclasped in his hand,\r\npinned it to one of the planks, and in an instant terminated its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a fish is it?\" asked William, as he looked upon the odd\r\ncreature thus oddly obtained.\r\n\r\n\"Suckin'-fish,\" was Ben's laconic answer.\r\n\r\n\"A sucking-fish!  I never heard of one before.  Why is it so-called?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it sucks,\" replied the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"Sucks what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sharks.  Didn't you see it suckin' at this 'un afore I pulled it from\r\nthe teat?  Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely it wasn't that, Ben?\" said the lad, mystified by Ben's remark.\r\n\r\n\"Well, boy, I an't, going to bamboozle ye.  All I know is that it\r\nfastens onto sharks, and only this sort, which are called _white\r\nsharks_; for I never seed it sticking to any o' the others,--of which\r\nthere be several kinds.  As to its suckin' anythin' out o' them an'\r\nlivin' by that, I don't believe a word o' it; though they say it do so,\r\nand that's what's given it its name.  Why I don't believe it is, because\r\nI've seed the creature stickin' just the same way to the coppered bottom\r\no' a ship, and likewise to the sides o' rocks under the water.  Now, it\r\ncouldn't get anything out o' the copper to live upon, nor yet out o' a\r\nrock,--could it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it couldn't be a suckin' them.  Besides, I've seed the stomachs o'\r\nseveral cut open, and they were full of little water-creepers,--such as\r\nthere's thousands o' kinds in the sea.  I warrant if we rip this 'un up\r\nthe belly, we'll find the same sort o' food in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why does it fasten itself to sharks and ships,--can you tell that,\r\nBen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heerd the reason, and it be sensible enough,--more so than to say\r\nthat it sucks.  There was a doctor as belonged in the man-o'-war where I\r\nsarved for two years, as was larned in all such curious things.  He said\r\nthat the suckin'-fish be a bad swimmer; and that I know myself to be\r\ntrue.  You can tell by the smallness o' its fins.  Well, the doctor, he\r\nsay, it fastens on to the sharks and ships so as to get carried from\r\nplace to place, and to the rocks to rest itself.  Whenever it takes a\r\nnotion, it can slip off, and go a huntin' for its prey; and then come\r\nback again and take a fresh grip on whatever it has chosen to lodge\r\nitself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's that curious thing along the back of its head that enables it to\r\nhold on, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's its sticking-machine; and, what be curious, Will'm, if you were\r\nto try to pull it off upwards or backwards you couldn't do it wi' all\r\nyour strength, nor I neither: you must shove it forrard, as you seed me\r\ndo just now, or else pull it to pieces before it would come off.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see,\" said William, holding the fish up to his eyes, \"that there\r\nare rows of little teeth in that queer top-knot it's got, all turned\r\ntowards the tail.  It is they, I suppose, that prevent its slipping\r\nbackwards?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt, lad,--no doubt it be that.  But never mind what it be just\r\nnow.  Let us finish flensin' o' the shark; and then if we feel hungry we\r\ncan make a meal o' the sucker,--for I can tell you it's the best kind o'\r\neatin'.  I've ate 'em often in the South-Sea Islands, where the natives\r\ncatch 'em with hooks and lines; but I've seen them there much bigger\r\nthan this 'un,--three feet long, and more.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, the sailor returned to the operation, thus temporarily\r\nsuspended,--the _flensing_ of the shark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SUCKING-FISH.\r\n\r\nThe fish that had thus singularly fallen into their hands was, as Ben\r\nhad stated, the sucking-fish, _Echeneis remora_,--one of the most\r\ncurious creatures that inhabit the sea.  Not so much from any\r\npeculiarity in appearance as from the singularity of its habits.\r\n\r\nIts appearance, however, is sufficiently singular; and looking upon it,\r\none might consider the creature as being well adapted for keeping\r\ncompany with the ferocious tyrant of the deep, on whom it constantly\r\nattends.\r\n\r\nIts body is black and smooth, its head of a hideous form, and its fins\r\nshort and broadly spread.  The mouth is very large, with the lower jaw\r\nprotruding far beyond the upper, and it is this that gives to it the\r\ncast of feature, if we may be permitted to speak of \"features\" in a\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nBoth lips and jaws are amply provided with teeth; and the throat,\r\npalate, and tongue are set profusely with short spines.  The eyes are\r\ndark, and set high up.  The \"sucker\" or buckler upon the top of its head\r\nconsists of a number of bony plates, set side by side, so as to form an\r\noval disc, and armed along the edges with little tentacles, or teeth, as\r\nthe boy William had observed.\r\n\r\nHis companion's account of the creature was perfectly correct, so far as\r\nit went; but there are many other points in its \"history\" quite as\r\ncurious as those which the sailor had communicated.\r\n\r\nThe fish has neither swim-bladder nor sound; and as, moreover, its fins\r\nare of the feeblest kind, it is probably on this account that it has\r\nbeen gifted with the power of adhering to other floating bodies, by way\r\nof compensation for the above-named deficiencies.  The slow and prowling\r\nmovements of the white shark, render it particularly eligible for the\r\npurposes of the sucking-fish, either as a resting-place or a means of\r\nconveyance from place to place; and it is well-known that the shark is\r\nusually attended by several of these singular satellites.  Other\r\nfloating objects, however, are used by the sucking-fish,--such as pieces\r\nof timber, the keel of a ship; and it even rests itself against the\r\nsides of submerged rocks, as the sailor had stated.  It also adheres to\r\nwhales, turtles, and the larger kinds of albacore.\r\n\r\nIts food consists of shrimps, marine insects, fragments of molluscous\r\nanimals, and the like; but it obtains no nutriment through the\r\nsucking-apparatus, nor does it in any way injure the animal to which it\r\nadheres.  It only makes use of the sucker at intervals; at other times,\r\nswimming around the object it attends, and looking out for prey of its\r\nown choice, and on its own account.  While swimming it propels itself by\r\nrapid lateral movements of the tail, executed awkwardly and with a\r\ntortuous motion.\r\n\r\nIt is itself preyed upon by other fish,--diodons and albacores; but the\r\nshark is merciful to it, as to the pilot-fish, and never interferes with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSucking-fish are occasionally seen of a pure white colour associating\r\nwith the black ones, and also attending upon the shark.  They are\r\nsupposed to be merely varieties or _albinos_.\r\n\r\nWhen sharks are hooked and drawn on board a ship, the sucking-fishes\r\nthat have been swimming around them will remain for days, and even\r\nweeks, following the vessel throughout all her courses.  They can then\r\nbe taken by a hook and line, baited with a piece of flesh; and they will\r\nseize the bait when let down in the stillest water.  In order to secure\r\nthem, however, it is necessary, after they have been hooked, to jerk\r\nthem quickly out of the water; else they will swim rapidly to the side\r\nof the ship, and fix their sucker so firmly against the wood, as to defy\r\nevery attempt to dislodge them.\r\n\r\nThere are two well-known species of sucking-fish,--the common one\r\ndescribed, and another of larger size, found in the Pacific, the\r\n_Echeneis australis_.  The latter is a better shaped fish than its\r\ncongener, can swim more rapidly, and is altogether of a more active\r\nhabit.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting fact in the history of the _Echeneis_ is\r\nits being the same fish as that known to the Spanish navigators as the\r\n_remora_, and which was found by Columbus in possession of the natives\r\nof Cuba and Jamaica, _tamed, and trained to the catching of turtles_!\r\n\r\nTheir mode of using it was by attaching a cord of palm sennit to a ring\r\nalready fastened round the tail, at the smallest part between the\r\nventral and caudal fins.  It was then allowed to swim out into the sea;\r\nwhile the other end of the cord was tied to a tree, or made fast to a\r\nrock upon the beach.  The _remora_ being thus set--just as one would set\r\na baited hook--was left free to follow its own inclinations,--which\r\nusually were to fasten its sucking-plates against the shell of one of\r\nthe great sea-turtles,--so famed at aldermanic feasts and prized by\r\nmodern _gourmets_, and equally relished by the ancient Cuban _caciques_.\r\n\r\nAt intervals, the turtle-catcher would look to his line; and when the\r\nextra strain upon it proved that the _remora_ was _en rapport_ with a\r\nturtle, he would haul in, until the huge _chelonian_ was brought within\r\nstriking distance of his heavy club; and thus would the capture be\r\neffected.\r\n\r\nTurtles of many hundreds' weight could be taken in this way; for the\r\npull upon the _remora_ being towards the tail,--and therefore in a\r\nbackward direction,--the sucking-fish could not be detached, unless by\r\nthe most violent straining.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of extreme singularity, that a similar method of capturing\r\nturtles is practised on the coast of Mozambique at the present day, and\r\nby a people who never could have had any communication with the\r\naborigines of the West Indian Islands, much less have learnt from them\r\nthis curious craft of angling with a fish!\r\n\r\nA smaller species of the sucking-fish is found in the Mediterranean,--\r\nthe _Echeneis remora_.  It was well-known to the ancient writers;\r\nthough, like most creatures gifted with any peculiarity, it was oftener\r\nthe subject of fabulous romance than real history.  It was supposed to\r\nhave the power of arresting the progress of a ship, by attaching itself\r\nto the keel and pulling in a contrary direction!  A still more\r\nridiculous virtue was attributed to it: in the belief that, if any\r\ncriminal in dread of justice could only succeed in inducing the judge to\r\npartake of a portion of its flesh, he would be able to obtain a long\r\ndelay before the judge could pronounce the verdict of his condemnation!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nA SAIL OF SHARK-FLESH.\r\n\r\nIt wanted but a little while of sunset, when the sailor and his young\r\ncomrade had finished flensing the shark.  The raft now exhibited quite\r\nan altered appearance.  Between the two upright oars several pieces of\r\nrope had been stretched transversely, and from these hung suspended the\r\nbroad thin flitches of the shark's flesh, that at a distance might have\r\nbeen mistaken for some sort of a sail.  Indeed, they acted as such; for\r\ntheir united discs presented a considerable breadth of surface to the\r\nbreeze, which had sprung up as the evening approached, and the raft by\r\nthis means moved through the water with considerable rapidity.\r\n\r\nThere was no effort made to steer it.  The idea of reaching land was\r\nentirely out of the question.  Their only hope of salvation lay in their\r\nbeing seen from a ship; and as a ship was as likely to come from one\r\ndirection as another, it mattered not to which of the thirty-two points\r\nof the compass their raft might be drifting.  Yes, it _did_ matter.  So\r\nthought Ben Brace, on reflection.\r\n\r\nIt might be of serious consequence, should the raft make way to the\r\nwestward.  Somewhere in that direction--how far neither could guess--\r\nthat greater raft, with its crew of desperate ruffians,--those drunken\r\nwould-be cannibals,--must be drifting about, like themselves, at the\r\nmercy of winds and waves: perhaps more than themselves suffering the\r\ndire extreme of thirst and hunger.  Perhaps, ere then, one of their own\r\nnumber may have been forced to submit to the horrid fate which they had\r\ndesigned for little William; and which, but for the interference of his\r\ngenerous protector, would most certainly have befallen him.\r\n\r\nShould he again fall into their clutches, there would be but slight\r\nchance of a second escape.  His protector knew that.  Ben knew,\r\nmoreover, that his own life would be equally sure of being sacrificed to\r\nthe resentment of the ribald crew, with whom he had formerly associated.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, as he felt the breeze blowing on his cheek, that he looked\r\ntowards the setting sun, to ascertain in what direction the raft was\r\nbeing borne.  No wonder that his anxious glance became changed to a look\r\nof satisfaction when he perceived that they were moving eastward.\r\n\r\n\"To the east'ard it are, sure enough,\" said he, \"and that be curious\r\ntoo.  'T an't often I've see'd the wind blow from the westward in these\r\nlatitudes.  Only another catspaw in the middle o' the calm.  'T won't\r\nlast long; though it won't matter, so long's it don't turn and blow us\r\nt'other way.\"\r\n\r\nThe expressed wish not to be blown \"t'other way\" needed no explanation.\r\nWilliam understood what that meant.  The fearful scene of the preceding\r\nday was fresh in his memory.  That scene, where half a score of\r\nfiend-like monsters, threatening his life, were kept at bay by one\r\nheroic man,--that was a tableau too terrible to be soon forgotten.\r\n\r\nNor had he forgotten it, even for a moment.  Perhaps, during that brief\r\nconflict with the sharks, the nearer danger may have driven it for an\r\ninterval out of his mind; but that over, the dread remembrance returned\r\nagain; and every now and then,--even while engaged in the varied labours\r\nthat had occupied them throughout the day,--in a sort of waking dream he\r\nhad recalled that fearful vision.  Often--every few minutes in fact--had\r\nhis eyes been turned involuntarily towards the west,--where, instead of\r\nlooking hopefully for a ship, his anxious glance betrayed a fear that\r\nany dark object might be seen in that direction.\r\n\r\nOn finishing their task, both were sufficiently fatigued,--the strong\r\nsailor as well as his feebler companion.  The former still kept his\r\nfeet, anxiously scanning the horizon; while the latter laid himself\r\nalong the bare boards of the raft.\r\n\r\n\"Little Will'm,\" said the sailor, looking down at the boy, and speaking\r\nin gentle tones, \"you'd better spread the sail under ye, and get some\r\nsleep.  There be no use in both o' us keeping awake.  I'll watch till it\r\ngets dark, an' then I'll join you.  Go to sleep, lad! go to sleep!\"\r\n\r\nWilliam was too wearied to make objection.  Drawing the skirt of the\r\nsail over the raft, he lay down upon it, and found sleep almost as soon\r\nis he had composed himself into the attitude to enjoy it.\r\n\r\nThe sailor remained standing erect; now sweeping the horizon with his\r\nglance, now bending his eye restlessly upon the water as it rippled\r\nalong the edge of the raft, and again returning to that distant\r\nscrutiny,--so oft repeated, so oft unrewarded.\r\n\r\nThus occupied, he passed the interval of twilight,--short in these\r\nlatitudes; nor did he terminate his vigil until darkness had descended\r\nupon the deep.\r\n\r\nIt promised to be a dark, moonless night.  Only a few feebly gleaming\r\nstars, thinly scattered over the firmament, enabled him to distinguish\r\nthe canopy of the sky from the waste of waters that surrounded him.\r\nEven a ship under full spread of canvas could not have been seen, though\r\npassing at a cable's length from the raft.\r\n\r\nIt was idle to continue the dreary vigil; and having arrived at this\r\nconviction, the sailor stretched himself alongside his slumbering\r\ncompanion, and, like the latter, was soon relieved from his\r\nlong-protracted anxiety by the sweet oblivion of sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERIOUS VOICE.\r\n\r\nFor several hours both remained wrapped in slumber, oblivious of the\r\nperils through which they had passed,--equally unconscious of the\r\ndangers that surrounded and still lay before them.\r\n\r\nWhat a picture was there,--with no human eye to behold it!  Two human\r\nforms, a sailor and a sailor-boy, lying side by side upon a raft scarce\r\ntwice the length of their own bodies, in the midst of a vast ocean,\r\nlandless and limitless as infinity itself both softly and soundly\r\nasleep,--as if reposing upon the pillow of some secure couch, with the\r\nfirm earth beneath and a friendly roof extended over them!  Ah, it was a\r\nstriking tableau, that frail craft with its sleeping crew,--such a\r\nspectacle as is seldom seen by human eye!\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate that for many hours they continued to enjoy the sweet\r\nunconsciousness of sleep,--if such may be termed enjoyment.  It was long\r\nafter midnight before either awoke: for there was nothing to awake them.\r\nThe breeze had kept gentle, and constant in the same quarter; and the\r\nslight noise made by the water, as it went \"swishing\" along the edge of\r\nthe raft, instead of rousing them acted rather as a lullaby to their\r\nrest.  The boy awoke first.  He had been longer asleep; and his nervous\r\nsystem, refreshed and restored to its normal condition, had become more\r\nkeenly sensitive to outward impressions.  Some big, cold rain-drops\r\nfalling upon his face had recalled him to wakefulness.\r\n\r\nWas it spray tossed up by the spars ploughing through the water?\r\n\r\nNo.  It was rain from the clouds.  The canopy overhead was black as ink;\r\nbut while the lad was scrutinising it, a gleam of lightning suddenly\r\nillumined both sea and sky, and then all was dark as before.\r\n\r\nLittle William would have restored his cheek to its sail-cloth pillow\r\nand gone to sleep again.  He was not dismayed by the silent lightning,--\r\nfor it was that sort that had flickered over the sky.  No more did he\r\nmind the threatening rainclouds.  His shirt had been soaked too often,\r\nby showers from the sky and spray from the sea, for him to have any\r\ndread of a ducking.\r\n\r\nIt was not that,--neither the presence of the lightning nor the prospect\r\nof the rain,--that kept him awake; but something he had heard,--or\r\nfancied he had heard,--something that not only restrained him from\r\nreturning to repose, but inspired him with a fear that robbed him of an\r\ninclination to go to sleep again.\r\n\r\nWhat was it he had heard or fancied?  A noise,--a _voice_!\r\n\r\nWas it the scream of the sea-mew, the shriek of the frigate-bird, or the\r\nhoarse note of the nelly?\r\n\r\nNone of these.  The boy-sailor was acquainted with the cries of all\r\nthree, and of many other sea-birds besides.  It was not the call of a\r\nbird that had fallen so unexpectedly on his ear, but a note of far\r\ndifferent intonation.  It more resembled a voice,--a human voice,--the\r\nvoice of a child!  Not of a very young child,--an infant,--but more like\r\nthat of a girl of eight or ten years of age!\r\n\r\nNor was it a cry of distress, though uttered in a melancholy tone.  It\r\nseemed to the ear of the lad--freshly awakened from his sleep--like\r\nwords spoken in conversation.\r\n\r\nBut it could not be what he had taken it for!  Improbable,--impossible!\r\nHe had been deluded by a fancy; or it might be the mutterings of some\r\nocean bird with whose note he was unacquainted.\r\n\r\nShould he awake his companion and tell him of it?  A pity, if it should\r\nprove to be nothing, or only the chattering of a sea-gull.  His brave\r\nprotector had need of rest.  Ben would not be angry to be awaked; but\r\nthe sailor would be sure to laugh at him if he were to say he had heard\r\na little girl talking at that time of night in the middle of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean.  Perhaps Ben might say it was a mermaid, and mock him in\r\nthat sort of style?\r\n\r\nNo: he would not run the risk of being ridiculed, even by his best of\r\nfriends.  Better let the thing pass, and say nothing about it.\r\n\r\nLittle William had arrived at this resolution, and had more than half\r\ndetermined to treat the sound he had heard as an _aurical_ delusion.  He\r\nhad even replaced his cheek upon the sail-cloth pillow, when the very\r\nsame sound again fill upon his ear,--this time more distinctly heard, as\r\nif either the utterance had been clearer or the being that made it was\r\nnearer!\r\n\r\nIf it was not the voice of a girl,--a very young girl,--then the\r\nboy-sailor had never listened to the prattling of his younger sister, or\r\nthe conversation of his little female playmates.  If it was a young\r\nmermaid, then most assuredly could mermaids talk: for the sound was\r\nexactly like a string or series of words uttered in conversation!\r\n\r\nBen must be aroused from his slumber.  It could not be an illusion.\r\nEither a talking mermaid, or a little girl, was within earshot of the\r\nraft.\r\n\r\nThere was no help for it: Ben must be aroused.\r\n\r\n\"Ben!  Ben!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ho--hah--ow--aw--what's the row?--seven bells, I bean't on the\r\ndog-watch.  Hi, hi, oh! it's you, little Will'm.  What is't, lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ben, I hear something.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear somethin'!  Well, what o' that, boy?  Theer 's allers somethin' to\r\nbe heerd: even here, in the middle o' the Atlantic.  Ah! boy, I was\r\ndreamin' a nice dream when ye woke me.  I thought I war back on the ole\r\nfrigate.  'T wa'nt so nice, eyther, for I thought the bos'n war roustin'\r\nme up for my watch on deck.  Anyhow, would a been better than this watch\r\nhere.  Heerd something ye say?  What d'ye mean, little Will'm?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard a voice, Ben.  I think it was a voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Voice--o' a human, do ye mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"It sounded like that of a little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Voice o' a little girl!  Shiver my timbers, lad, you're goin' demented!\r\nPut yer face close to mine.  Let me see ye, boy!  Are ye in yer senses,\r\nWill'm?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am, Ben.  I'm sure I heard what I've said.  Twice I heard it.  The\r\nfirst time I wasn't sure; but just now I heard it again, and if--\"\r\n\r\n\"If there hadn't been gulls, an' boobies, an' Mother Carey's chickens,\r\nas squeals and chitters just like little childer, I'd a been puzzled at\r\nwhat ye be a tellin' me; but as I knows there be all o' these creators\r\nin the middle o' the broad ocean,--and mermaids too, I dare say,--then,\r\nye see, little Will'm, I must disbelieve that ye heard anything more\r\nthan the voice of--a man, by--!\"\r\n\r\nAs the sailor terminated his speech with this terrible emphasis, he\r\nstarted into an upright attitude, and listened with all his ears for\r\nanother utterance of that harsh monotone that, borne upon the breeze and\r\nrising above the \"sough\" of the disturbed water, could easily be\r\ndistinguished as the _voice of a man_.\r\n\r\n\"We're lost, Will'm!\" cried he, without waiting for a repetition of the\r\nsound; \"we're lost.  It's the voice of Le Gros.  The big raft is a\r\nbearin' down upon us wi' them bloodthirsty cannibals we thought we'd got\r\nclear o'.  It's no use tryin' to escape.  Make up your mind to it, lad;\r\nwe've got to die! we've got to die!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nOTHER WAIFS.\r\n\r\nHad it been daylight, instead of a very dark night, Ben Brace and his\r\nyouthful comrade would have been less alarmed by the voices that came up\r\nthe wind.  Daylight would have discovered to them an object, or rather\r\ncollection of objects, which, instead of repelling, would have attracted\r\nthem nearer.\r\n\r\nIt was not the great raft that was drifting to leeward, nor was it the\r\nvoice of Le Gros or any of his wicked companions, that had been heard;\r\nthough, in the excitement of their fears, that was the first thought of\r\nthe two castaways.\r\n\r\nCould their eyes have penetrated the deep obscurity that shrouded the\r\nsea, they would have beheld a number of objects, like themselves, adrift\r\nupon the water, and like them, at the mercy of the winds and waves.\r\nThey would have seen pieces of timber, black and charred with fire;\r\nfragments of broken spars, with sails and cordage attached and trailing\r\nafter them; here and there a cask or barrel, sunk to the level of the\r\nsurface by the weight of its contents; pieces of packing-cases, torn\r\nasunder as if by some terrible explosion; cabin-chairs, coops, oars,\r\nhandspikes, and other implements of the mariner's calling,--all bobbing\r\nabout on the bosom of the blue deep, and carried hither and thither by\r\nthe arbitrary oscillations of the breeze.\r\n\r\nThese various objects were not all huddled up together, but scattered\r\nunequally over a space of more than a square mile in extent.  Had it\r\nbeen daylight, so that the sailor could have seen them, as they appeared\r\nmottling the bright surface of the sea, he would have experienced no\r\ndifficulty in determining their character.  At a glance he would have\r\nrecognised the _debris_ of the burnt ship, from which he and his\r\ncompanion had so narrowly escaped,--the slave-bark _Pandora_.\r\n\r\nHe would have looked upon these objects with no very great surprise, but\r\nin all likelihood with a feeling of considerable satisfaction: as\r\noffering the means for recruiting the strength of his own slight\r\nembarkation, which was barely sufficient to sustain the weight of\r\nhimself and his companion, and certainly not strong enough to withstand\r\nthe assault of the most moderate of storms.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the \"waifs\" above enumerated, however, there was one not\r\nyet named,--one that differed greatly from all the rest,--and which, had\r\nit been seen by them, would have caused extreme surprise both to Ben\r\nBrace and little William.\r\n\r\nIt was a raft, not a great deal larger than their own, but altogether of\r\ndifferent construction.  A number of planks most of them charred by\r\nfire, with a sofa, a bamboo chair, and some other articles of furniture,\r\nhad been rudely bound together by ropes.  These things, of themselves,\r\nwould have made but a very clumsy craft, no better for navigating the\r\ngreat ocean than that upon which Ben and the boy were themselves\r\nembarked.  But the buoyancy of the former was secured by a contrivance\r\nof which the sailor had not had the opportunity of availing himself.\r\nAround its edge were ranged hogsheads or water-casks, evidently empty.\r\nThey were lashed to the plank; and being bunged up against the influx of\r\nthe water, kept the whole structure afloat, so that it would have\r\ncarried a ton or two without sinking below the surface.\r\n\r\nThere was a smaller cask floating alongside, attached to the timbers by\r\na piece of rope that was tightly looped around the swell.  But this\r\ncould not have been designed to increase the buoyancy of the raft: since\r\nit was itself almost submerged, evidently by the weight of something it\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nSuch a congeries of objects might have drifted side by side by chance,\r\nor the caprice of the currents; but they could not have tied themselves\r\ntogether in such fashion.  There was design in the arrangement; and in\r\nthe midst of the circle of empty hogsheads might have been seen the\r\ncontriver of this curious craft.  He was, of course, a human being, and\r\na man; but such an one as, under any circumstances, would arrest the\r\nattention of the beholder; much more in the singular situation in which\r\nhe was then met with.  He was a black man, in the fullest sense of the\r\nword; a true negro, with a skin shining like ebony; a skull of large\r\nsize, and slightly square in shape, covered with a thick crop of curling\r\nwool, so close and short as to appear _felted_ into the skin.  A brace\r\nof broad ears stood prominently out from the sides of his head; and\r\nextending almost from one to the other, was a wide-gaping mouth, formed\r\nby a pair of lips of huge thickness, protruding far forward, so as to\r\ngive to the countenance those facial outlines characteristic of the\r\nchimpanzee or gorilla.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his somewhat abnormal features, the expression of the\r\nnegro's face was far from being hideous.  It was not even disagreeable.\r\nA double row of white teeth, gleaming between the purplish lips, could\r\nbe exhibited upon ordinary occasions in a pleasant smile; and the\r\nimpression derived from looking upon the countenance was, that the owner\r\nof it was rather good-natured than otherwise.  Just then, as he sat upon\r\nthe raft, gazing over the bulwark of hogsheads, its expression was one\r\nof profound and sombre melancholy.  No wonder!\r\n\r\nThe negro was not alone.  Another individual shared with him the\r\noccupancy of the raft;--one differing from him in appearance as Hyperion\r\nfrom the Satyr.  A few feet from him, and directly before his face, was\r\na little girl, apparently about ten or twelve years of age.  She was\r\nseated, or rather cowering, among the timbers of the raft, upon a piece\r\nof tarpauling that had been spread over them, her eyes bent upon her\r\nblack companion, though occasionally straying, with listless glance,\r\nover the sombre surface of the sea.  Although so young, her countenance\r\nappeared sad and despondent, as if under the belief that there was\r\nlittle hope of escape from the fearful situation in which she was\r\nplaced, and as if her little spirit had long ago surrendered to despair.\r\n\r\nThough not a negro like her companion, the girl could scarce be called\r\n_white_.  Her complexion was of that hue known as olive; but her hair,\r\nalthough curling, hung in long locks down over her shoulders; and the\r\ncrimson hue deeply tinting her cheeks told that in her blood there was\r\nmore Caucasian than negro.\r\n\r\nAny one who had visited the western coast of Africa, on seeing this\r\nlittle girl, would easily have recognised in her features the type of\r\nthat mixed race which has resulted from long intercourse between the\r\nPortuguese \"colonists\" and the sable indigenes of the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nHOW SNOWBALL ESCAPED FROM THE SLAVER.\r\n\r\nOn this curious embarkation, drifting about amid the remains of the\r\nwrecked ship, there were only the two human figures,--the negro and the\r\nlittle girl.  It is superfluous to say that they were also a portion of\r\nthe wreck itself,--other castaways who had, so far, succeeded in saving\r\nthemselves from the fearful doom that had overtaken, no doubt, every one\r\nof the wretched beings composing the _cargo_ of the slaver.\r\n\r\nThe negro upon the raft, though black as the blackest of his unfortunate\r\ncountrymen, was not among the number of those who had been carried as\r\n_freight_.  On the contrary, he was one of the crew,--the lord of the\r\ncaboose, and known upon the slave-bark by the satirical _soubriquet_ of\r\n\"Snowball.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough originally a slave from Africa, and by race a Coromantee,\r\nSnowball had long been in the enjoyment of his liberty; and, as cook or\r\nsteward, had seen service in scores of ships, and circumnavigated the\r\nglobe in almost every latitude where circumnavigation was possible.\r\n\r\nThough not naturally of a wicked disposition, he was by no means\r\nparticular as to the company he kept, or the sort of ship he sailed\r\nin,--so long as the wages were good and the store-room well supplied;\r\nand as these conditions are usually found on board of a slaver, it was\r\nnot Snowball's first voyage in a vessel of the kind.  It is true that he\r\nhad never sailed in company with a more ribald crew than that of the\r\n_Pandora_; but it is only justice to say, that, long before the fatal\r\ninterruption of that voyage, even he had become tired of their\r\ncompanionship, and had been almost as eager to get away from the ship as\r\nBen Brace or little William.\r\n\r\nHe, too, had been deterred from attempting to escape while upon the\r\nAfrican coast, by the knowledge that such an attempt would have been\r\nworse than idle.  In all likelihood it would have ended in his being\r\ncaptured by his own countrymen,--or, at all events, by people of his own\r\ncolour,--and sold once more into that very slavery from which he had\r\nformerly succeeded in emancipating himself.\r\n\r\nThough Snowball's morality was far from being immaculate, there was one\r\nvirtue which he was not wanting,--gratitude.  But for the possession of\r\nthis, he might have been alone upon the raft, and, perhaps, less caring\r\nin what direction the winds and waves might carry him.  As it was, his\r\nsole thought and anxiety was about his little companion, whose safety\r\nwas as dear to him as his own.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked why Snowball felt this unselfish solicitude.  The child\r\ncould not be his own?  Complexion, features, everything forbade the\r\nsupposition that there could be anything of kinship between her and her\r\nsable protector.\r\n\r\nNor was there the slightest.  On the contrary, the little girl was the\r\ndaughter of one who had once been Snowball's greatest enemy,--the man\r\nwho had sold him into slavery; but who had afterwards won the negro's\r\ngratitude by restoring to him his freedom.  This person had formerly\r\nowned a trading fort on the coast of Africa, but of late years had been\r\na resident of Rio in Brazil.  His daughter, born in the former country,\r\nprevious to his leaving it, was crossing the great ocean to rejoin him\r\nin his new home in the western world.  Hence her presence on board the\r\n_Pandora_, where she had been a passenger under the protection of\r\nSnowball.\r\n\r\nAnd well had the negro performed his duty as protector.  When all the\r\nothers had forsaken the ship, and the flames were fast spreading over\r\nher decks, the faithful negro had gone below, and, rousing the girl from\r\nher sleep,--for she had been slumbering unconscious of the danger,--had\r\nborne her amidst flames and smoke, at the imminent risk of his own life,\r\nand passing through the cabin windows with his burden in his arms, he\r\nhad dropped down into the sea under the stern of the burning bark.\r\n\r\nBeing an excellent swimmer, he had kept afloat for some minutes,\r\nsustaining both himself and his burden by his own strength; but after a\r\nwhile he succeeded in clutching on to the davit-tackle by which the gig\r\nhad been let down into the water, and having passed his foot through a\r\nloop in the end of it, he remained half suspended, half afloat on the\r\nwater.  Soon after came the explosion, caused by the ignition of the\r\ngunpowder; and as the vessel was blown to pieces, the sea around became\r\nstrewed with fragments of shattered timber, cabin furniture, sea-chests,\r\nand the like.  Laying hold on those pieces that were nearest, he\r\nsucceeded in forming a rude sort of raft, upon which he and his\r\n_protege_ were enabled to pass the remainder of the night.\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned, Snowball and the little Lalee--such was the name of\r\nthe child--were the only beings who appeared to have survived the\r\ncatastrophe,--the wretched creatures who at the last moment had escaped\r\nfrom the \"'tween-decks\" were no longer in existence.\r\n\r\nHaving been brought from the interior of the African continent,--and\r\nfrom a district where there are no great lakes or rivers,--but few of\r\nthem could swim; and those few had become the prey of the sharks, that\r\nin scores were swimming around the frail craft.  As the sun rose over\r\nthe ocean, and lit up the scene of that terrible tragedy, Snowball saw\r\nnot a living creature save his own _protege_, the sharks, and their\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\nThe negro knew, however, that the _Pandora's_ own people had escaped.\r\nHe had witnessed the clandestine departure of the gig, containing the\r\nskipper and his confederates.\r\n\r\nThis he had seen, while gazing through the windows of the cabin,\r\nprevious to launching himself upon that last desperate leap.  He had\r\nalso been a witness to the departure of the great raft carrying the\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nIt may appear strange that he did not swim towards it, and share the\r\nfortunes of his former associates.  Why he did not do so is easily\r\nexplained.  By an accident, arising from his own negligence, the ship\r\nhad been set on fire.  He was aware of this; and he knew also that both\r\ncaptain and crew were equally cognisant of the fact.  The former, just\r\nafter the discovery, assisted by the brutal mate, had administered to\r\nhim (Snowball) such a chastisement as he would not soon forget; while\r\nthe crew, on becoming acquainted with the circumstance, were upon the\r\npoint of tossing him into the sea; and would no doubt have carried their\r\ndesign into execution, but for the presence of the appalling danger\r\nimpelling them to look to their own safety.  The negro knew, therefore,\r\nthat, were he to seek safety on the great raft, it would only be to\r\nthrow himself into merciless hands, certain to spurn him back with\r\nvengeful indignation, or fling him into the jaws of the hideous monsters\r\nalready swimming around the ship, and quartering the sea in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFor this reason had Snowball chosen to trust to his own strength,--to\r\nchance,--to anything rather than the mercy of his old associates, with\r\nwhom, for a long period past, he had been far from a favourite.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it had turned out for the best.  Had he succeeded in reaching\r\nthe great raft, and been permitted to share with its occupants their\r\nchances of safety, it is more than probable that the little Lalee might\r\nhave become the victim of that horrid attempt from which the little\r\nWilliam had so narrowly escaped!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL AMID THE DRIFT.\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Snowball and his _protege_, from the blowing up of the\r\n_Pandora_ until six suns had risen and gone down over the ocean, if not\r\nso varied as those of Ben Brace and his _protege_, were nevertheless of\r\nsufficient interest to deserve a brief narration.\r\n\r\nSupported by the few sticks which he had been able to draw together, he\r\nhad remained during the rest of the night in the midst of the floating\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nHe had listened to the wild shouts of vengeful rage, proceeding from the\r\nthroats of the slaves as they clutched at the great raft, and were\r\nbeaten back by those who occupied it.  He had seen the broad sail\r\nsuddenly hoisted, and the dark mass gradually gliding away over the\r\nocean.  He had heard many an agonising yell as, one by one, the few\r\nstrong swimmers who survived the rest either sank by exhaustion or were\r\ndragged down in the jaws of the numerous sharks; until, the last shriek\r\nhaving sounded in his ears, all became silent as the tomb, while the\r\nsombre surface of the sea once more lay motionless around him.  Even the\r\nravening monsters, for a moment, seemed to have forsaken the spot,--as\r\nif each, having secured a sufficient prey, had gone down to devour it\r\nundisturbed in the dark unfathomed caverns of the deep.\r\n\r\nWhen morning dawned upon the scene, although many objects met the eye of\r\nthe negro and his companion, there was no human being within sight; and\r\nSnowball knew that, with the exception of the six men who had rowed off\r\nin the gig, and the crew upon the great raft, there were no other\r\nsurvivors of the slaver.\r\n\r\nThe crew having spread a sail to get out of reach of the drowning\r\nwretches who were clutching at their raft, the latter was soon carried\r\nout of sight; while the six in the gig had rowed off as fast as they\r\nwere able, in order to get out of reach of their own companions!  For\r\nthese reasons, when day broke over the ocean, neither boat nor raft were\r\nvisible from the spot where the catastrophe had occurred.\r\n\r\nIt may appear strange that none of the living cargo of the slaver had\r\nsucceeded in saving themselves, by clinging to some fragment of the\r\nwreck; and Snowball thought so at the time.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, that those who could swim had struck out after the raft,\r\nand had followed it so far that they were not able to swim back to the\r\nburning vessel; while the others, in the wild terror produced by the\r\nproximity of the flames, had leaped despairingly into the sea, and sunk\r\nupon the instant.\r\n\r\nThe early sunbeams, as they fell slantingly over the surface of the sea,\r\ntold the negro that he was alone,--alone with the little Lalee,--alone\r\nin the middle of the Atlantic Ocean,--afloat upon a few sticks,--without\r\na morsel of food to eat, without a drop of water to drink!\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible situation,--sufficient to produce despair even in the\r\nstoutest heart.\r\n\r\nBut Snowball was not one of the despairing sort.  He had been too often\r\nin peril of life--both by sea and land--to be unnerved even in that\r\ndread hour; and instead of permitting his spirits to become prostrated,\r\nhe bethought him of how he might make the best of the circumstances by\r\nwhich he was surrounded.\r\n\r\nAn object that came under his eye, just as the day began to break,\r\nkindled within him a faint gleam of hope, and urged to making an effort\r\nfor the salvation of himself and his helpless companion.  This object\r\nwas a small keg, or beaker, which chanced to be floating near him, and\r\nwhich, from some mark upon it, Snowball recognised.  He knew that it had\r\nbeen standing in a corner of the caboose, previous to the blowing up of\r\nthe bark; and, moreover, that it contained several gallons of fresh\r\nwater, which he had himself surreptitiously abstracted from the common\r\nstock, previous to the time that the slaver's crew had agreed to being\r\nput upon rations.\r\n\r\nIt was but the work of a minute to secure this keg, and attach it by a\r\nstrong cord to the piece of timber on which the ex-cook was seated\r\nastride.\r\n\r\nBut for this unexpected supply of water Snowball might probably have\r\nyielded to despair.  Without water to drink he could not have reckoned\r\non a long lease of life,--either for himself or his _protege_.  So\r\nopportunely had the keg come before his eyes as to seem a Providential\r\ninterference; and the belief or fancy that it was so stimulated him to a\r\nfurther search among the fragments of the shattered ship.\r\n\r\nThere were many queer things around him,--like himself bobbing about\r\nupon the tiny waves.  One, however, soon monopolised his attention; and\r\nthat was a barrel of somewhat flimsy structure, and about the size of\r\nthose usually employed for carrying flour.  Snowball recognised it also\r\nas an old acquaintance in the store-room, and knew that it was filled\r\nwith the best kind of biscuit,--a private stock belonging to the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\nIts contents could not fail to be saturated with salt-water, for the\r\nbarrel was not water-tight; but the ex-cook could dry them in the sun,\r\nand render them, if not palatable, at least eatable.\r\n\r\nThe biscuit-barrel was soon fished up out of the water, and placed high\r\nand dry upon the little raft.\r\n\r\nSnowball was next struck with the necessity of improving the quality of\r\nhis craft, by giving it increase both in size and strength.  With this\r\nintention--after having possessed himself of an oar, out of several that\r\nwere adrift--he commenced paddling about among the floating fragments,\r\nhere and there picking up such pieces as appeared best suited to his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIn a short while he succeeded in collecting a sufficient number of spars\r\nand other pieces of timber,--among which figured a portion of his own\r\nold tenement, the caboose,--to form a raft as large as he might require;\r\nand to his great satisfaction he saw around him the very things that\r\nwould render it _seaworthy_.  Bobbing about on the waves, and at no\r\ngreat distance, were half a dozen empty water-casks.  There had been too\r\nmany of them aboard the slaver: since their emptiness was the original\r\ncause of the catastrophe that had ensued.  But there were not too many\r\nfor Snowball's present purpose; and, after paddling first to one and\r\nthen another, he secured each in turn, and lashed them to his raft, in\r\nsuch fashion, that the great hogsheads, sitting higher in the water than\r\nthe timbers of the raft, formed a sort of parapet around it.\r\n\r\nThis task accomplished, he proceeded to collect from the wreck such\r\nother articles as he fancied might be of service to him; and, thus\r\noccupied, he spent several days on the spot where the _Pandora_ had gone\r\nto pieces.\r\n\r\nThe slight breezes that arose from time to time, and again subsided, had\r\nnot separated his raft from the other objects still left floating near.\r\nIn whatever direction they went, so went he: since all were drifting\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe idea had never occurred to the negro to set up a sail and endeavour\r\nto get away from the companionship of the inanimate objects around\r\nhim,--souvenirs as they were of a fearful disaster.  Or rather it had\r\noccurred to him, and was rejected as unworthy of being entertained.\r\nSnowball, without knowing much of the theory of navigation, had\r\nsufficient practical acquaintance with the great Atlantic Ocean,--\r\nespecially that part of it where lies the track of the dreaded \"middle\r\npassage,\"--long remembered by the transported slave,--Snowball, I say,\r\nwas sufficiently acquainted with his present whereabouts, to know that a\r\nsail set upon his raft, and carrying him hither and thither, would not\r\nadd much to the chances of his being rescued from a watery grave.  His\r\nonly hope lay in being picked up by some passing vessel; and, feeling\r\nconvinced of this, he made no effort to go one way or the other, but\r\nsuffered himself to be drifted about, along with the other waifs of the\r\nwreck, whithersoever it pleased the winds or the currents of the ocean\r\nto carry him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL AT SEA ON A HENCOOP.\r\n\r\nFor six days had Snowball been leading this sort of life, along with the\r\nlittle Lalee,--subsisting partly on the sea-steeped biscuit found in the\r\nbarrel, and partly upon other provisions which had turned up among the\r\ndrift; while the precious water contained in the keg had hitherto kept\r\nthem from suffering the pangs of thirst.\r\n\r\nDuring these six days he had never wholly surrendered himself up to\r\ndespair.  It was not the first, by several times, for the old sea-cook\r\nto have suffered shipwreck; nor was it his first time to be cast away in\r\nmid-ocean.  Once had he been blown overboard in a storm, and left\r\nbehind,--the ship, from the violence of the wind, having been unable to\r\ntack round and return to his rescue.  Being an excellent swimmer, he had\r\nkept afloat, buffeting with the huge billows for nearly an hour.  Of\r\ncourse, in the end, he must have gone to the bottom, as the place where\r\nthe incident occurred was hundreds of miles from any land.  But just as\r\nhe was on the point of giving in, a hencoop came drifting past, to which\r\nhe at once attached himself, and this being fortunately of sufficient\r\nsize to sustain his weight, hindered him from sinking.\r\n\r\nThough he knew that the hencoop had been thrown out of the ship by some\r\nof his comrades, after he had gone overboard, the ship herself was no\r\nlonger in sight; and the unlucky swimmer, notwithstanding the help given\r\nhim by the hencoop, must eventually have perished among the waves; but\r\nthe storm having subsided, and the wind suddenly changing into the\r\nopposite quarter, the vessel was wafted back on her old track, and\r\npassing within hail of Snowball, his comrades succeeded in rescuing him\r\nfrom his perilous situation.\r\n\r\nWith the retrospect of such an experience,--and Snowball could look back\r\nupon many such,--he was not the man to yield easily to despair.  On the\r\ncontrary, he now acted as if he believed that there was still not only\r\nsome hope, but a considerable chance of being delivered from the dilemma\r\nin which the late disaster of the _Pandora_ had placed him.\r\n\r\nScarce an hour during the six days had he permitted to pass in idleness.\r\nAs already stated, he had collected ample materials from the wreck\r\nfloating around him.  Out of these he had formed a good-sized raft,\r\nhaving spent much time and labour in giving it strength and security.\r\nThis accomplished, and all the provisions he could find safely stored\r\nupon it, he had devoted the rest of his time to fishing.\r\n\r\nThere were many fish in the neighbourhood of the wreck.  Fearful fish\r\nthey were too: for they were sharks: the same that had made such havoc\r\namong the unfortunate creatures who had constituted the cargo of the\r\nslaver.  These voracious monsters,--though satiated for a time with\r\ntheir human prey,--had not forsaken the spot where the _Pandora_ had\r\ngone to pieces; but on the square mile of surface strewed by the\r\nfloating fragments of the wreck they could still be seen in pairs, and\r\nsometimes in larger numbers, with their huge sail-like fins projecting\r\nhigh above the water, veering about as if once more hungry, and\r\nquartering the sea in search of fresh victims.\r\n\r\nSnowball had not succeeded in capturing any of the sharks, though he had\r\nspared no pains in endeavouring to do so.  There were other large fish,\r\nhowever, that had made their appearance in the proximity of his raft,\r\nattracted thither by the common prospect of food promised by the wreck\r\nof the slaver.  There were albacores, and bonitos, and dolphins, and\r\nmany other kinds of ocean fish, rarely seen, or only upon such\r\nmelancholy occasions.  With a long-handled harpoon, which Snowball had\r\nsucceeded in securing, he was enabled to strike several of these\r\ncreatures; so that by the evening of the sixth day, his larder was\r\nconsiderably increased,--comprising, in the way of fish, an albacore, a\r\nbrace of bonitos, with three satellites of the sharks,--a pilot-fish and\r\ntwo sucking-fish.\r\n\r\nAll these had been ripped open and disembowelled, after which their\r\nflesh, cut into thin slices, and spread out on the tops of the empty\r\nwater-casks that surrounded the raft, was in process of being cured by\r\ndrying in the sun.\r\n\r\nBefriended by the fine weather, Snowball had succeeded, one way and\r\nanother, in accumulating no mean store of provisions; and, so far as\r\nfood went, he felt confident, both for himself and his companion, of\r\nbeing able to hold out not only for days, but for weeks or even months.\r\n\r\nHe felt equal confidence in regard to their stock of water.  Having\r\ngauged the keg in his own rude way, and satisfied himself as to the\r\nquantity of its contents, he had made a calculation of how long it might\r\nlast, and found that by a careful economy it could be depended upon for\r\na period of several weeks.\r\n\r\nReposing upon these pleasant data, on the night of the sixth day he had\r\ngone to rest with a feeling of confidence that soon enticed his spirit\r\ninto the profoundest slumbers.\r\n\r\nNot that Snowball had gone without sleep during the other five nights\r\nspent upon his raft.  He had slept a little on each of them.  Only a\r\nlittle, however; for, as most of them had been moonlight nights, he had\r\nkept awake during the greater portion of each, on the lookout over the\r\nsurface of the ocean, lest some ship, sailing near, might glide past\r\nsilently and unseen, and so deprive him of a chance of being picked up.\r\n\r\nThe little Lalee had also borne part in these nocturnal vigils,--taking\r\nher turn when Snowball became too weary to keep awake; and so, in\r\nalternate watches, had the two been in the habit of tiring out the long\r\nhours of the night.  To this practice the sixth night had proved an\r\nexception.  There was no moon in the sky; there were no stars; not a\r\nglimmer of light, either in the firmament of the heavens or on the face\r\nof the deep.  The sky above and the sea below were both of one colour,--\r\nthe hue of pitch.  On such a night it was idle to keep watch.  A ship\r\nmight have passed within a cable's length of the raft, and still\r\nremained unseen; and, filled with this conviction, both Snowball and his\r\ncompanion, after the night had fairly closed over them, stretched their\r\nbodies along the pieces of sail-cloth that formed their respective\r\ncouches, and surrendered their spirits to the sweet enchantment of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nTHE FLASH OF LIGHTNING.\r\n\r\nSnowball began to snore almost as soon as he had closed his eyelids, and\r\nas if the shutting of his eyes had either occasioned or strengthened the\r\ncurrent of breath through his nostrils.\r\n\r\nAnd such a sound as the snore of the Coromantee was rarely heard upon\r\nthe ocean,--except in the \"spouting\" of a whale or the \"blowing\" of a\r\nporpoise.\r\n\r\nIt did not wake the little Lalee.  She had become accustomed to the\r\nsnoring of Snowball,--which, instead of being a disturber, acted rather\r\nas a lullaby to her rest.\r\n\r\nIt was only after both had been asleep for many hours after midnight,--\r\nin fact when Lalee was herself sleeping less soundly, and when a snore,\r\nmore prolonged and prodigious than any that had preceded it, came\r\nswelling through the nostrils of the sea-cook,--it was only then that\r\nthe young girl was awakened.\r\n\r\nBecoming aware of what had awakened her, she would have gone to sleep\r\nagain; but just as she was about re-composing herself upon her\r\nsail-cloth couch, a sight came before her eyes that caused her not only\r\nto remain awake, but filled her with a feeling of indescribable awe.\r\n\r\nOn the instant of opening her eyes, the sky, hitherto dark, had become\r\nsuddenly illumined by lightning,--not in streaks or flashes, but as if a\r\nsheet of fire had been spread for an instant over the whole canopy of\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the surface of the sea had been equally lighted up with\r\nthe vivid gleam; and among the many objects drifting around the raft,--\r\nthe remnants of the wreck, with which the eyes of the little Lalee had\r\nnow become familiarised,--she saw, or fancied she saw, one altogether\r\nnew to her.\r\n\r\nIt was a human face and figure, in the likeness of a beautiful boy, who\r\nappeared to be kneeling on the water, or on some slight structure on a\r\nlevel with the surface of the sea!\r\n\r\nThe lightning had revealed other objects beside him and over him.  A\r\npair of slender sticks, standing some feet apart, and in a perpendicular\r\nposition, with some white strips suspended between them, in the gleam of\r\nthe lightning shone clear and conspicuous.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that the little Lalee should feel surprise\r\nat an apparition,--so unexpected, in such a place, and under such\r\ncircumstances.  It is not to be wondered at that her first impulse\r\nshould be to rouse her companion out of his snoring slumbers.\r\n\r\nShe did so upon the instant, and without waiting for another flash of\r\nlightning either to confirm her belief in what she had seen, or convince\r\nher that it was only an apparition,--which her fancy, disturbed by the\r\ndreams in which she had been indulging, had conjured up on the instant\r\nof her awaking.\r\n\r\n\"Wha's dat you say?\" inquired Snowball, abruptly awakened in the middle\r\nof a superb snore; \"see something! you say dat, ma pickaninny?  How you\r\nsee anyting such night as dis be?  Law, ma lilly Lally, you no see de\r\nnose before you own face.  De 'ky 'bove am dark as de complexyun ob dis\r\nole nigga; you muss be mistake, lilly gal!--dat you muss!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, Snowball!\" replied Lalee, speaking in gumbo Portuguese, \"I\r\nam not mistaken.  It wasn't dark when I saw it.  There was lightning;\r\nand it was as clear as in daylight for a little while.  I'm sure I saw\r\nsome one!\"\r\n\r\n\"What was de some one like?\" interrogated Snowball, in an accent that\r\nproclaimed incredulity.  \"Was 'um a man or a woman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neider!  Den it muss ha' been,--ha! maybe it war a mermaid!\"\r\n\r\n\"What I saw looked like a boy, Snowball.  O, now I think of it, like\r\nthat boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What boy you 'peak 'bout?\"\r\n\r\n\"He who was aboard the ship,--the English boy who was one of the\r\nsailors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you mean de little Will'm, I 'pose.  I reck'n dat 'ere lad hab gone\r\nto de bott'm ob de sea long afore dis, or else he get off on de big\r\nraff.  I know he no go 'long wi' de cappen, 'case I see de little chap\r\nclose by de caboose after de gig row 'way.  If he hab go by de raff dem\r\nruffins sure eat him up,--dat be if dey get hungry.  Dey sure do dat!\r\nHark! what's dat I heer?  Sure's my name be Snowball, I hear some 'un\r\n'peak out dere to win'ard.  D'you hear anything, lilly Lally?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Snowball: I think I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"What you tink you?\"\r\n\r\n\"A voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort o' voice?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a boy's voice,--just like _his_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"The boy-sailor aboard the ship.  O, listen!  There it is again; and\r\nsurely I hear another?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gorramity! little gal, you 'peak de troof.  Sure 'nuff dere am a\r\nvoice,--two ob dat same.  One am like de boy we 'peak 'bout,--odder more\r\nlike a man o' full groaf.  I wonder who dey can be.  Hope 't an't de\r\nghoses of some o' de _Pandoras_ dat ha' been drowned or eat up by de\r\nsharks.  Lissen 'gain, Lally, an' try make dem out.\"\r\n\r\nHaving imparted this injunction, the negro raised himself into a\r\nhalf-erect attitude; and facing to windward with his arms resting upon\r\none of the empty casks,--which, as already stated, formed a sort of\r\ncircular parapet around his raft,--he remained silent and listening.\r\n\r\nThe little Lalee had also assumed a half-erect attitude; and, by the\r\nside of her sable companion, kept peering out into the darkness,--in the\r\nhope that another flash of lightning might again reveal to her eyes the\r\nfeatures of that beautiful boy, who, alone of all upon that fated ship,\r\nhad made upon her mind an impression worthy of being remembered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTO THE OARS.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to die!\"\r\n\r\nAs the sailor gave utterance to these words of fearful import, he\r\nstarted from his recumbent position, and, half-erect upon the raft,\r\nremained listening,--at the same time endeavouring with his glance to\r\npierce the darkness that shrouded the surface of the deep.\r\n\r\nLittle William, terrified by the speech of his protector, made no\r\nrejoinder, but with like silence continued to look and listen.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing visible save sea and sky; and these, in the dim\r\nobscurity, were not to be distinguished from each other.  A raft or\r\nboat,--even a large ship,--could not have been seen at two cables'\r\ndistance from that on which they were drifting along; and the only\r\nsounds now heard were the sighing of the night breeze, and the \"swish\"\r\nof the water as it swept along the sides of their slight embarkation.\r\n\r\nFor five minutes or more there was nothing to interrupt this duetto of\r\nwinds and waves, and Ben was beginning to believe he had been mistaken.\r\nIt might not have been the voice of a man, nor a voice at all.  He was\r\nbut half awake when he fancied hearing it.  Was it only a fancy,--an\r\nillusion?  It was at the best very indistinct,--as of some one speaking\r\nin a muttered tone.  It might be the \"blowing\" of a porpoise, or the\r\nutterance of some unknown monster of the sea: for the sailor's\r\nexperience had taught him that there are many kinds of creatures\r\ninhabiting the ocean that are only seen at rare intervals even by one\r\nwho is constantly traversing it, and many others one may never see at\r\nall.  Could the sounds have proceeded from the throat of some of these\r\nhuman-like denizens of the deep, known as _dugongs, lamantins,\r\nmanatees_, and the like?\r\n\r\nIt was strangest of all that William had heard the voice of a girl: for\r\nthe lad still adhered to the belief that he had done so.  That might\r\nhave been the cry of a bird, or a mermaid; and Ben would have been ready\r\nenough to accept the latter explanation.  But the voice of a young girl,\r\ncoupled with that of a man, rendered the circumstance more mysterious\r\nand altogether inexplicable.\r\n\r\n\"Didn't you hear a man's voice, lad?\" he asked at length, with a view\r\neither of dissipating his doubts or confirming them.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied the boy.  \"Yes, Ben; I'm sure I did, not loud, but\r\nmuttered like.  But I don't know whether if was Le Gros.  O, if it was!\"\r\n\r\n\"Thee have good reason to know his ugly croak, the parleyvooin'\r\nscoundrel!  That thee have, Will'm!  Let's hope we are both mistaken:\r\nfor if we're to come across them ruffins on the big raft, we needn't\r\nexpect mercy at their hands.  By this time they'll be all as hungry as\r\nthe sharks and as ravenin' too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed William, in accents of renewed fear, \"I hope it's not\r\nthem!\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak low, lad!\" said the sailor, interrupting him, \"only in whispers.\r\nIf they be near, the best thing for us are to keep quiet.  They can't\r\nsee us no more than we can them; anyhow, till it come mornin'.  If we\r\ncould hear the sound again so as to make out the direction.  I didn't\r\nnotice that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" interrupted William.  \"Both the voices I heard were out this\r\nway.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy pointed to leeward.\r\n\r\n\"To leuart, you think they wur?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure they came from that quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"That be curious, hows'ever,\" said the sailor.  \"If't be them on the big\r\nraft they must a passed us, or else the wind must a veered round, for\r\nwe've been to leuart o' them ever since partin' wi' 'em.  Could the wind\r\na gone round I wonder?  Like enough.  It be queer,--and it's blowing\r\nfrom the west in this part o' the Atlantic!  'Tan't possible to say what\r\npoint it be in, hows'ever,--not without a compass.  There bean't even\r\nthe glimmer o' a star in the sky; and if there wur we couldn't make much\r\no' it; since the north star bean't seen down in these latitudes.  Thee\r\nbe sure the sound come from leuart?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I am quite sure of it, Ben; the voices came up the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'd best go the same way and gie 'em as wide a berth as possible.\r\nLook alive, lad!  Let's down wi' them flitches o' the shark-meat: for\r\nit's them that's driftin' us along.  We'll take a spell at the oars, and\r\nafore daylight we may get out o' hearin' o' the voices, and out of sight\r\no' them as has been utterin' o' them.\"\r\n\r\nBoth rose simultaneously to their feet, and commenced taking down the\r\nslices of half-dried shark-flesh, and placing them upon the\r\nsail-cloth,--with the intention, as the sailor had counselled it, to\r\nunship the oars that had been doing duty as masts, and make use of them\r\nin their proper manner.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this operation both remained silent,--at intervals\r\nstopping in their work to listen.\r\n\r\nThey had got so far as to clear away the suspended flitches, and were\r\nabout unfastening the cords where they were looped around the upright\r\noars, when another cord, attached to one of the latter, caught their\r\nattention.  It was the piece of rope which closed the mouth of their\r\ntarpauling water-bag, and held the latter in such a position as to keep\r\nthe \"cask\" from leaking.\r\n\r\nFortunately they were doing things in a deliberate manner.  If they had\r\nbeen acting otherwise, and had rashly \"unstepped\" the mast to which that\r\npiece of rope was attached, their stock of fresh water would have been\r\nrapidly diminished,--perhaps altogether spilled into the salt sea,\r\nbefore they should have become aware of the disaster.  As it was, they\r\nperceived the danger in good time; and, instead of taking down the oar,\r\nat once desisted from their intention.\r\n\r\nIt now became a question as to whether they should proceed any further\r\nin the design of rowing the raft to windward.  With a single oar they\r\ncould make but little way; and the other was already occupied in doing a\r\nduty from which it could not possibly be spared.\r\n\r\nIt is true there were still left the fragments of the hand spike that\r\nhad been ground between the teeth of the surviving shark, and afterwards\r\npicked up as they drifted past it.  This might serve instead of the oar\r\nto support the mouth of the water-bag; and as soon as this idea occurred\r\nto them they set about carrying it into execution.\r\n\r\nIt took but a few minutes of time to substitute one stick for the other;\r\nand then, both oars being free, they seated themselves on opposite sides\r\nof the raft, and commenced propelling it against the wind,--in a\r\ndirection contrary to that in which the mysterious voices had been\r\nheard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nSHIP AHOY!\r\n\r\nThey had not made over a dozen strokes of their oars,--which they\r\nhandled cautiously and in silence, all the while listening intently,--\r\nwhen their ears were again saluted by sounds similar to those first\r\nheard by little William, and which he had conjectured to be the voice of\r\na young girl.  As before, the utterance was very low,--murmured, as if\r\nrepeating a series of words,--in fact, as if the speaker was engaged in\r\na quiet conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Shiver my timbers!\" exclaimed the sailor, as soon as the voice again\r\nceased to be heard.  \"If that bean't the palaver o' a little girl, my\r\nname wur never Ben Brace on a ship's book.  A smalley wee thing she seem\r\nto be; not bigger than a marlinspike.  It sound like as if she wur\r\ntalkin' to some un.  What the Ole Scratch can it mean, Will'm?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.  Could it be a mermaid?\"\r\n\r\n\"Could it?  In course it could.\"\r\n\r\n\"But are there mermaids, Ben?\"\r\n\r\n\"Maremaids!  Be theer maremaids?  That what you say?  Who denies there\r\nain't?  Nobody but disbelevin land-lubbers as never seed nothin'\r\ncurious, 'ceptin' two-headed calves and four-legged chickens.  In coorse\r\nthere be maremaids.  I've seed some myself; but I've sailed with a\r\nshipmate as has been to a part o' the Indyan Ocean, where there be whole\r\nschools o' 'em, wi' long hair hangin' about their ears an' over their\r\nshoulders, just like reg'lar schools o' young girls goin' out for a walk\r\nin the outskirts o' Portsmouth or Gravesend.  Hush! theer be her voice\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\nAs the sailor ceased speaking, a tiny treble, such as might proceed from\r\nthe tongue of a child,--a girl of some eight or ten years old,--came\r\ntrembling over the waves, in tones that betokened a conversation.\r\n\r\nA moment or two elapsed; and then, as if in reply to the words spoken by\r\nthe child, was heard another voice,--evidently that of a man!\r\n\r\n\"If the one be a maremaid,\" whispered Ben to his companion, \"the other\r\nmust be a mareman.  Shiver my timbers, if it ain't a curious confab!\r\nMoonrakers and skyscrapers! what can it mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" mechanically answered the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow,\" continued the sailor, apparently relieved by the reflection,\r\n\"_It ain't the big raft_.  There's no voice like that little 'un among\r\nits crew o' ruffins; and that man, whosomever he be, don't speak like Le\r\nGros.  I only thought so at first, bein' half asleep.\r\n\r\n\"If it be a school o' maremaids,\" pursued he, \"theer an't no danger,\r\neven wi' theer men along wi' 'em.  Leastwise, I never heerd say there\r\nwur from maremaids more'n any other weemen; an' not so much, I dare ay.\r\nSartin it bean't the Frenchman, nor any o' that scoundrel crew.  Lord o'\r\nmercy!  It might be a ship as is passing near us!\"\r\n\r\nAs this thought occurred to the speaker, he raised himself into an erect\r\nattitude, as if to get a better view.\r\n\r\n\"I'll hail, Will'm,\" he muttered; \"I'll hail 'em.  Keep your ears open,\r\nlad; and listen for the answer.  _Ship ahoy_!\"\r\n\r\nThe hail was sent in the direction whence the mysterious sounds appeared\r\nto have proceeded.  There came no response; and the sailor, after\r\nlistening attentively for a second or two, repeated the \"Ship ahoy!\"\r\nthis time in a louder key.\r\n\r\nQuick as an echo the words came back, though it could not be an echo.\r\nThere are no echoes upon the ocean; besides, the voice that repeated the\r\nwell-known phrase was quite different from that of him who had first\r\npronounced it.  Though different both in tone and accent, it was\r\nevidently a human voice; and, as evidently, that of a man.  A rude,\r\nrough voice it was; but it is superfluous to say that, to the ears of\r\nBen Brace and his youthful companion, it sounded sweeter than any music\r\nto which they had ever listened.  The words \"Ship ahoy!\" were soon\r\nsucceeded by others, proceeding from the same lips.\r\n\r\n\"Gorramity!\" spoke the strange voice, \"who de debbil call dar?  Dat\r\nsome'dy in de boat?  Dat you, Capten?  Am it you, Massa Grow?\"\r\n\r\n\"A negro,\" muttered Ben to his companion.  \"It's Snowball, the cook.  It\r\ncan't be anybody but him.  In the name o' Neptune how has the darkey got\r\nthere?  What's he aboard o'?  He warn't on the great raft wi' the rest.\r\nI thought he'd gone off in the captain's gig.  If that wur so, then it's\r\nthe boat that is near us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied William, \"I'm sure I saw Snowball by the caboose after the\r\ngig had rowed away.  As he wasn't with them on the big raft, I supposed\r\nhe'd been drowned, or burned up in the ship.  Surely, it's his voice?\r\nThere it is again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy-hoy-hoy!\" once more came the words pealing over the water in\r\na loud prolonged drawl.  \"Ship ahoy, some'dy call out dar?  What ship am\r\ndat?  Am it a ship at all?  Or am it some o' de wreck Pandoray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Castaways,\" responded Ben.  \"Castaways of the bark _Pandora_, Who\r\ncalls?  Snowball!  Be it you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat same chile,--who am you?  Am it you, massa Capten,--in de gig?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Massa Grow, den, on de big raff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither,\" responded the sailor.  \"It's Ben,--Ben Brace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golly! you say so, Massa Brace!  How you be dar, unless you on de big\r\nraff?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm on a raft of my own.  Have you one, Snowball?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ya, massa Ben, ya!  I make um out o' de wreck an de water-cask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are ye all alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not 'zackly dat.  The pickaninny be long wi' me,--de cabing gal.  You\r\nknow de lilly Lalee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! she it be!\" muttered Ben, now remembering the little cabin\r\npassenger of the Pandora.  \"You bean't movin', be you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" responded Snowball, \"lying on de water like a log o' 'hogany wood.\r\nHan't move a mile ebba since de bustin' ob de powder ball.\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep your place then.  We've got oars.  We'll row down to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We--you say we?  You got some'dy sides yaself on dat raff?\"\r\n\r\n\"Little Will'm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lilly Willum,--ah? dat ere brave lilly lad.  See 'im jess as I go down\r\nin de cabin fo' get de pickaninny.  See 'im forrard with axe,--he knock\r\noff de gratin' ob de fore-hatch,--he set all dem 'ere niggas free.  It\r\nwarn't no use,--not bit good o' dem.  Dey all got eat up by de shark, or\r\ndey go down straight to de bottom.  Gorramity! how dey s'riek an'\r\n'cream, an' jump overboard into de water!\"\r\n\r\nNeither the sailor nor Little William paid any heed to the negro's\r\nhalf-soliloquised narrative, further than to make use of his voice to\r\nguide them through the darkness towards the spot whence it proceeded.\r\nOn discovering that it was Snowball who was near, both had turned upon\r\ntheir own craft, and were now rowing it in the opposite direction to\r\nthat in which, but the moment before, they had been so eagerly\r\npropelling it.\r\n\r\nAs they now pulled to leeward, they had the wind in their favour; and by\r\nthe time the negro arrived at the end of his disjointed narrative, they\r\nwere within half a cable's length of him, and, through the darkness,\r\nwere beginning to distinguish the outlines of the odd embarkation that\r\ncarried Snowball and his _protege_.\r\n\r\nJust then the lightning blazed across the canopy of heaven, discovering\r\nthe two rafts,--each to the other.  In ten seconds more they were _en\r\nrapport_, and their respective crews congratulating each other, with as\r\nmuch joyfulness as if the unexpected encounter had completely delivered\r\nthem from death and its dangers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE RAFTS EN RAPPORT.\r\n\r\nTwo travellers meeting in the midst of a lone wilderness, even though\r\nstrangers to each other, would not be likely to pass without speaking.\r\nIf old acquaintances, then would they be certain to make the longest\r\npause possible, and procrastinate their parting till the last moment\r\nallowed by the circumstances.  If these circumstances would permit of\r\ntheir reaching their respective destinations by the same route, how\r\nsorry would each be to separate, and how happy to enter into a mutual\r\nalliance of co-operation and companionship!\r\n\r\nJust like two such travellers, or two parties of travellers, meeting in\r\nthe midst of the desert,--a wilderness of land,--so met, in the midst of\r\nthe ocean,--the wilderness of water,--the two rafts whose history we\r\nhave hitherto chronicled.  Their crews were not strangers to each other,\r\nbut old acquaintances.  If not all friends in the past, the\r\ncircumstances that now surrounded them were of a kind to make them\r\nfriends for the future.  Under the awe inspired by a common danger, the\r\nlion will lie down with the lamb, and the fierce jaguar consorts with\r\nthe timid capivara no longer trembling at the perilous proximity.\r\n\r\nBut there was no particular antipathy between the crews of the two rafts\r\nthus singularly becoming united.  It is true that formerly there had\r\nbeen some hostility displayed by the negro towards Little William, and\r\nbut little friendship between the former and Ben Brace.  These, however,\r\nwere things of the past; and during the last days of their companionship\r\non board the _Pandora_ the sentiments of all three had undergone a\r\nchange.  An identity of interests had produced a certain three-cornered\r\nsympathy,--obliterating all past spite, and establishing, if not\r\npositive friendship, at least a sort of triangular forgiveness.  Of\r\ncourse this affection was of the isosceles kind,--Ben and Little William\r\nbeing the _sides_, and Snowball the _base_.  It is scarce necessary to\r\nsay, that, meeting again under the circumstances described, all past\r\nspite, had there been any, would have been forgiven and forgotten.\r\n\r\nFortunately this had been already done.  Between Ben and Snowball, and\r\nSnowball and Little William, the hatchet had been long ago buried; and\r\nthey now met, not as enemies, but as old acquaintances,--almost as\r\nfriends: nay, we might say, _altogether_ as friends.  If not so before,\r\nthe common danger had made them so now, and amicably did they greet one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAfter such an encounter, it is superfluous to say that no thought of\r\nagain separating entered into the minds of any of the party.  The crews\r\nof both rafts knew that their destinations were identical.\r\n\r\nEach was an _ocean waif_, seeking to escape from the wilderness of\r\nwaters,--longing for deliverance from a common danger.  In company they\r\nmight have a better chance of obtaining it.  Why should they separate to\r\nsearch for it?\r\n\r\nThe question did not occur to either,--in thought or in word.  From the\r\nmoment of their meeting, instinct told them that their destinies were\r\nthe same,--that their action in future should be united.\r\n\r\nAfter the two rafts had collided together, and those involuntary but\r\njoyful salutations were exchanged between their crews, the respective\r\nskippers became occupied with the more serious business of uniting the\r\nfrail embarkations into one, and rendering them for the future\r\ninseparable.\r\n\r\n\"Snowball!\" inquired the sailor, \"have you got any spare rope?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty o' dat 'ere,\" responded the ex-cook of the _Pandora_.\r\n\r\n\"Yar am a coil o' strong sinnet.  Dat do?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the stuff,\" responded Ben.  \"Heave it this way, ye son of a\r\nsea-cook!  Heave!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued he, laying hold of the coil of sennit, and tossing back\r\none end over an empty water-cask.  \"Make fast there, Snowey!  I dare say\r\nwe can lay alongside safe enough till daylight!  After that we'll splice\r\ntogether in a better sort o' way.\"\r\n\r\nThe ex-cook, obedient to the injunctions of the seaman, seized hold of\r\nthe end of rope thrown to him, and made it fast to one of the spars\r\nwhich comprised his singular craft; while at the same time Ben busied\r\nhimself in tying the other end to the piece of handspike erected upon\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nSoon each completed his task; and after some time spent in a mutual\r\ndetail of the adventures that had befallen them since the hour of\r\nseparation on the deck of the ill-fated Pandora, it was agreed that all\r\nshould go to rest for the remainder of the night, and with the earliest\r\nlight of day take measures to perpetuate the union of the two wandering\r\nwaifs thus unexpectedly brought into companionship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTING THE RAFT.\r\n\r\nThe crews of both rafts were astir by early dawn, the sailor arousing\r\none and all from their slumbers.  The rising sun, as it shone over the\r\nocean, fell upon four faces, all wearing a very different expression\r\nfrom that which they had exhibited at his setting on the day before.  If\r\nnot positively cheerful, there was at least hopefulness in their looks:\r\nfor their renewed companionship had mutually inspired one and all with\r\nrenewed hopes of deliverance.  Indeed, it was evident even to the\r\nyoungest of the party, that this unexpected union of strength would\r\nmaterially increase the chances of escape from the common danger; since\r\nthe two strong men working together could do many things that would have\r\nbeen impossible to either of them alone,--to say nothing of the\r\nencouragement and confidence always springing from concerted action.\r\n\r\nThe very fact of their having come together in the way they had done\r\nseemed something more than accidental.  It looked less like mere\r\naccident than that they had been favoured by the hand of Providence; and\r\neven the rude seaman, and the still ruder sea-cook, were only too glad\r\nto give way to the fancy that Providence was interfering on their\r\nbehalf.\r\n\r\nCertainly, the succession of fortunate events with which both had been\r\nfavoured,--and which had not only hitherto sustained them, but promised\r\nto preserve their lives for a still longer period,--certainly, these\r\ncircumstances were sufficient to beget the belief that they were\r\nspecially under the protection of some power less capricious than mere\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nThe fact of their having encountered each other--even when one of them\r\nhad been in the act of taking measures to avoid the encounter--was of\r\nitself something to strengthen this conviction, and increase their\r\nhopefulness for the future.\r\n\r\nThis very effect it produced; and it was for that reason that Ben Brace\r\nwas so early astir, and so early in arousing the others.\r\n\r\nThe sailor had had too much experience in the capriciousness of the wind\r\nto believe that such calm weather as they had been enjoying for days\r\nwould last much longer; and he had got up betimes with a view of uniting\r\nthe two rafts, and strengthening the structure that might spring out of\r\ntheir union, so that it might resist whatever storm should threaten.\r\n\r\nTo attempt constructing a craft of such capability did not seem so\r\nhopeless to the skilful seaman.  Before it had appeared so; but now,\r\nwith the materials composing the two rafts, and others which the morning\r\nsun disclosed drifting about upon the surface of the sea, the thing\r\nlooked less of an impossibility.  In fact, it did not appear at all\r\nimpossible; and for this reason Ben and the black at once came to the\r\ndetermination to attempt it.\r\n\r\nAfter a short time spent in deliberation, it was resolved to break up\r\nthe lesser raft,--that which had hitherto carried the sailor and little\r\nWilliam.  The planks composing it could be transferred to the larger and\r\nbetter structure which Snowball had got together; and this was\r\nfurthermore to be reconstructed and considerably enlarged.\r\n\r\nIt was not designed to make any great alteration in the shape or fashion\r\nwhich Snowball had chosen for his craft, which displayed great ingenuity\r\non the part of its designer.  As it was deemed proper enough, his design\r\nwas to be retained,--only the construction was to be on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nBefore setting to work, it was essential that something in the shape of\r\na breakfast should be swallowed.  This was drawn from the stores which\r\nSnowball had been engaged for days in accumulating, and consisted simply\r\nof biscuit and dried \"bonito.\"\r\n\r\nIn the absence of any fire, the ex-cook had no opportunity to exercise\r\nhis peculiar vocation, else the meal might have been more palatable.\r\nThe biscuits from having had a salt bath were a little briny to the\r\ntaste; but that signified little to such sharp appetites as they were\r\ncalled upon to satisfy; and it was not such a bad breakfast, when washed\r\ndown, as it was, with a little _wine_ and water.\r\n\r\nYou may be asking whence came the wine; and this was the very question\r\nwhich the sailor addressed to Snowball, on discovering such a commodity\r\nupon his craft.\r\n\r\nThe answer was easy enough.  A small cask of \"Canary\" had been one of\r\nthe items among the cabin stores.  At the explosion it had been pitched\r\ninto the sea; and not being quite full had freely floated on the\r\nsurface.  Snowball had taken possession of it by attaching it to his\r\ntimbers.\r\n\r\nBreakfast over, the work of reconstruction commenced.  As a preliminary,\r\nthe flitches of shark-meat were removed from the little raft, now doomed\r\nto destruction; while that ingenious contrivance of the sailor,--the\r\ncanvas water-cask,--now no longer required, was emptied of its contents;\r\nwhich, with the greatest care, were decanted into the safe depository of\r\none of the empty hogsheads that had been hitherto acting as supports to\r\nthe embarkation of Snowball.\r\n\r\nThe oars, sail-cloth, piece of handspike, axe, and tarpauling were also\r\ntransferred to the latter; and then the planks, and fragments of yards\r\nand spars, were loosed from their lashings, and one by one distributed\r\ninto their proper places in the new structure.\r\n\r\nAll day long did the work continue,--only an interval of an hour being\r\nappropriated to the midday meal.  Excursions, too, were made from point\r\nto point,--the oars serving to propel the half-constructed craft: the\r\nobject of these excursions being to pick up such pieces of timber,\r\nropes, or other articles as Snowball had not already secured.  The aid\r\nof the others now rendered many items available which Snowball had\r\nformerly rejected as useless,--because unmanageable by himself while\r\nacting alone.\r\n\r\nThe sun set upon their task still unfinished; but they retired hopefully\r\nto rest: for the sky promised a continuance of the calm weather, and\r\nthey knew that if the promise was kept, a few hours in the morning of\r\nthe following day would suffice to complete the construction of a\r\nraft,--one that would not only give them ample accommodation for the\r\nstowage both of themselves and their stores, but would in all\r\nprobability ride out any gale likely to be encountered in that truly\r\n_pacific_ part of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE CATAMARAN.\r\n\r\nNext morning, as soon as there was light enough for them to see what\r\nthey were about, the work was resumed; and the timbers having been put\r\ntogether in a fashion to satisfy all hands, were lashed to one another\r\nas tightly as the united strength of the sailor, Snowball, and Little\r\nWilliam could draw the ropes around them.\r\n\r\nThe structure when completed was of an oblong shape,--somewhat\r\nresembling a punt or flat-bottomed ferry-boat,--nearly twenty feet in\r\nlength by about half as much in breadth of beam.  The empty hogsheads\r\nwere placed around the edge in a regular manner.  One lay crosswise at\r\nthe head, while another was similarly situated as regarded the stern.\r\nThe other four--there were six in all--were lashed lengthwise along the\r\nsides,--two of them opposite each other on the larboard and starboard\r\nbows, while the other two respectively represented the \"quarters.\"  By\r\nthis arrangement a certain symmetry was obtained; and when the structure\r\nwas complete, it really looked like a craft intended for navigation, and\r\nby Ben Brace,--its chief architect,--it was facetiously christened _The\r\nCatamaran_.\r\n\r\nBy noon of the second day the _Catamaran_ was completed,--so far as the\r\n_hull_ was concerned.  Had Snowball been by himself he would have left\r\nit in that state: for the black did not yet believe that there was the\r\nslightest probability of reaching land by means of such an embarkation.\r\n\r\nBut the sailor,--more skilled in such matters,--was of a different way\r\nof thinking.  He believed it not only possible, but probable enough,\r\nthat this feat might be accomplished.  He knew that they were in the\r\nvery centre of the southern trade-wind; and that the raft, even if left\r\nto itself, would in time drift onward to some point on the coast of\r\nSouth America.  With a sail its speed would be accelerated; and\r\nalthough, thus furnished, such a clumsy structure could not sail very\r\nswiftly, there was still a chance of its carrying them safely,--if\r\nslowly,--to land.  Ben knew it was simply a question of time,--dependent\r\nupon how long their provisions might last them,--but more especially\r\ntheir supply of water.\r\n\r\nHaving formed in his own mind a sort of rough calculation as to the\r\nchances, and finding them rather in favour of the scheme, he determined\r\non making trial of it, by erecting a mast upon the raft, and to this\r\nbending a sail.  At the worst, their chances of being picked up would be\r\nquite as good while sailing with the wind, as if they allowed themselves\r\nto lie adrift upon the ocean.\r\n\r\nFortunately the materials for both mast and sail were on hand, and in\r\nabundance.  They had found the \"spanker\" of the _Pandora_ floating\r\nabout, with its boom and all the cordage attached.  By using the boom as\r\na mast, and another smaller spar as a boom, they could rig up such a\r\nsail as would carry the _Catamaran_ through the water with considerable\r\nvelocity.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had fully considered it in his own mind, the sailor, aided\r\nby Snowball and Little William, proceeded to rig the _Catamaran_, and by\r\nthe close of the third day from the commencement of their labours a tall\r\nmast stood up out of the centre of that curious craft, midships between\r\nstem and stern, with boom and guy, and a broad sail hanging loosely\r\nalong its yard,--ready to be spread to the first breath of wind that\r\nmight blow westward over the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe breeze which had brought Ben and little William back among the\r\nwreck-drift of the slave-bark, leading to a renewal of intercourse with\r\ntheir old shipmate, Snowball, had been blowing in the contrary direction\r\nto that in which the sailor intended to steer.  This breeze, however,\r\nwas not such as was to be looked for in that latitude.  It was only a\r\nmere puff,--a cat's-paw,--in the midst of the calm that had continued\r\nfor many days after the destruction of the slaver.  It had lulled again\r\non the same night in which the rafts had become united; and ever\r\nsince,--during the three days they had been at work in the construction\r\nof the _Catamaran_,--the calm had continued without intermission.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day things remained the same,--not a breath stirring from\r\nany quarter to ruffle the glassy surface of the sea; which, like a\r\nmirror, reflected the odd image of the _Catamaran_, with her six\r\nhogsheads set like bulwarks around her sides, and her stout mast\r\ntapering tall and solitary out of her midst.\r\n\r\nNeither her captain,--Ben Brace of course,--nor those of her crew who\r\nwere capable of reflecting on the future, and providing for its probable\r\ncontingencies, regretted this inaction,--forced upon them by the\r\ncontinuance of the calm.  Indeed, although becalmed, the \"Catamarans\"\r\nwere not inactive.  There was work worthy of their activity, and which\r\noccupied them during the whole of the day.  By the aid of oars,--several\r\nof which were fortunately in their possession,--they kept the new craft\r\nin constant motion; quartering the square mile of sea-surface, upon\r\nwhich floated the fragments of the ill-fated _Pandora_.\r\n\r\nMany a waif did they pick up, and stow away on their new craft against\r\nthe contingency of some future need.\r\n\r\nAmong other \"floating fragments\" Ben chanced upon his own sea-chest;\r\nwhich secured him a change of linen,--to say nothing of a full suit of\r\n\"Sunday go-ashores\" and variety of knick-knacks likely to prove of\r\nservice on the problematical voyage he proposed making.\r\n\r\nThe chest itself was retained to serve as a useful \"locker.\"\r\n\r\nThe fourth day being spent in such fashion, the Catamarans retired to\r\nrest,--little William, at the request of the sailor, repeating the\r\nLord's Prayer, and ending it, by the dictation of the latter, with a\r\nshort petition for a wind that would waft them to the westward!\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if that simple petition had been heard and granted.  As the\r\nsun once more rose over the ocean, its glossy surface became broken into\r\ntiny corrugations by a breeze blowing as if from the sun himself.  The\r\nsail was run up the slippery mast; it was tightly sheeted home; and the\r\n_Catamaran_, rushing rapidly through the water, soon cleared herself\r\nfrom that fatal spot where the slaver had perished.\r\n\r\n\"Westward ho!\" cried Ben Brace, as he saw the sail swell out, and the\r\ncraft, the product of his own skill, walking proudly away through the\r\nwater like a \"thing of life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Westward ho!\" simultaneously echoed Snowball and Little William; while\r\nthe eyes of Lilly Lalee sparkled with joy, as she beheld the\r\nenthusiastic bearing of her companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nLITTLE WILLIAM AND LILLY LALEE.\r\n\r\nThe wind was favourable in more senses than one.  Besides blowing in the\r\ndesired direction, it kept steady and continuous,--never rising above a\r\ngentle breeze, nor again returning to that calm from which they had just\r\nescaped, and the recurrence of which, to the captain of the _Catamaran_,\r\nwould have been almost as unwelcome as a gale.\r\n\r\nIt was just the sort of wind for the trial of a new craft--barely\r\nruffling the surface of the sea, and yet filling the sail till its sheet\r\nwas as taut as a bow-string.  As it blew direct from the east, that part\r\nof the _Catamaran_ which Ben had christened her _head_ was pointed due\r\nwestward; and to hinder the craft from veering round, or luffing back\r\ninto the eye of the wind, her builders had constructed a steering\r\napparatus at the stern.  It was simply a very large oar,--one that had\r\nappertained to the longboat of the _Pandora_,--placed fore and aft\r\nacross the swell of the stern water-cask.  It was held in that position\r\nby ropes attaching it to the cask, at the same time that they permitted\r\nit to play through the water, and perform the office of a rudder.  By\r\nmeans of this simple contrivance,--which had been rigged before starting\r\non her cruise,--the _Catamaran_ could be steered to any point of the\r\ncompass, and kept either before the wind, or luffed up as close to it as\r\nshe was capable of sailing.\r\n\r\nOf course it required one or other of them to be always at the \"wheel,\"\r\nas Ben facetiously styled the steering apparatus, and the first spell of\r\nthis duty the captain had taken upon himself, considering it too\r\nimportant,--so long as it was only on trial,--to be intrusted either to\r\nSnowball or little William.  After they should get fairly under way, and\r\nthere could be no longer any doubt as to the sailing qualities of the\r\n_Catamaran_, both the above-mentioned individuals would be expected to\r\ntake their turn \"at the wheel.\"\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour the _Catamaran_ continued her course, without\r\nanything occurring to interrupt the \"even tenor of her way.\"  Her\r\ncaptain, seated in the stern, and still in charge of the steering-oar,\r\nwas the only one occupied in the conduct of the craft.  Snowball was\r\nbusy among his stores,--most of which lay in a mass amidships,--\r\narranging them into some sort of order, and placing each article in the\r\nmost suitable position to withstand any sudden assault of the winds and\r\nwaves.\r\n\r\nLittle William and Lilly Lalee were far forward against the cask which\r\nrepresented the head of the craft, and which, being quite empty, stood\r\nhigh above the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nNeither was engaged in any particular employment,--except in talking\r\nkindly to each other, and at intervals exchanging expressions of joy at\r\nthe fortune that had so singularly reunited them under two such\r\ncourageous protectors.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, on board the slaver,--during that brief voyage, brought\r\nto such an abrupt and disastrous termination,--the two had seen but\r\nlittle of one another, and knew less.  The pretty little Portuguese had\r\nbeen kept within the cabin, never going beyond the confines of the\r\n\"quarter\"; while the English lad, in continual fear of receiving rough\r\ntreatment from either the captain or mates, rarely ventured within that\r\nsacred precinct unless in obedience to some command from his dreaded\r\nsuperiors.\r\n\r\nThen stayed he only long enough to execute the order as speedily as\r\npossible,--knowing that to linger by the cabin would be to expose\r\nhimself to rude insult,--perhaps to be pitched into the scuppers or\r\nkicked back to the forecastle.\r\n\r\nUnder such disadvantageous circumstances, it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat the sailor-boy found but few opportunities of holding communication\r\nwith the half-caste girl, who, by the singular chances already stated,\r\nhad been his fellow-voyager on board the ill-fated bark.\r\n\r\nThough he had held but slight converse with his youthful _compagnon du\r\nvoyage_, and knew but little either of her moral or intellectual\r\ncharacter, he was nevertheless most intimately acquainted with her\r\npersonal appearance.  There was not a feature in her pretty, sweet face,\r\nnot a ringlet in her jetty curling hair, with which his eyes were not\r\nperfectly familiar.\r\n\r\nOfttimes had he stood,--half-screened behind the sails,--gazing upon her\r\nas she loitered by the cabin hatch, surrounded by rude ruffian forms,\r\nlike a little white lamb in the midst of so many wolves.\r\n\r\nOfttimes had the sight caused his pulse to beat and his heart to throb\r\nwith throes in which pain and pleasure were equally commingled, but the\r\ncause of which he could not comprehend.\r\n\r\nNow, seated side by side with this young creature on board the\r\n_Catamaran_,--even on that frail embarkation, which at any moment might\r\nbe scattered to the winds, or whelmed under the black billows of the\r\nsea,--the sailor-boy no longer felt pain while gazing in her face, but\r\nonly that sweet incomprehensible pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTOO LATE!\r\n\r\nNearly two hours had transpired since the starting of the _Catamaran_,--\r\nduring which time but little change took place in the relative positions\r\nof those on board.  Then, however, Snowball having finished the stowage\r\nof his stores, proposed taking his turn at steering.  The offer was\r\nwillingly accepted by the sailor, who, relinquishing his hold upon the\r\noar, went forward amidships.  There he had placed his old sea-chest;\r\nand, kneeling in front of it, he commenced rummaging among its contents,\r\nwith the design of making himself more familiar with them, and seeing\r\nwhether he might not discover some article inside that would be\r\nserviceable under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nWilliam and Lilly Lalee still remained by the head,--the boy habitually\r\nkeeping a lookout over the ocean, but at frequent intervals turning his\r\nglances towards her who sat by his side, and endeavouring to interest\r\nher with his conversation.\r\n\r\nThe girl could not speak English,--only a few phrases which she had\r\npicked up from English or American seamen, who had visited her father's\r\nfort upon the African coast.  These, though by her repeated in all\r\ninnocence, were neither of the most refined character, nor yet\r\nsufficiently comprehensive to enable her to hold any lengthened\r\ndialogue.  It was in her own tongue that the conversation between her\r\nand William was carried on: for the lad had picked up a somewhat\r\nextensive vocabulary of Portuguese among the sailors of the _Pandora_--\r\nmany of whom were of that nation.  It was a sort of \"lingoa geral\"\r\nspoken along the seaboard of Africa,--not unlike a similar Portuguese\r\npatois, current on the coasts and large rivers of tropical South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIn this language, little William, by the aid of signs and gestures, was\r\nable to keep up an occasional conversation with Lilly Lalee.\r\n\r\nDuring the two hours which the sailor had remained at the\r\nsteering-oar,--and for some time after,--no incident occurred to\r\ninterrupt the tranquillity of the _Catamaran's_ crew.\r\n\r\nA very odd sort of fish, swimming about a cable's length ahead of the\r\ncraft, had attracted the attention of William and the girl,--exciting\r\ntheir curiosity so much as to cause them to rise to their feet and stand\r\nwatching it.\r\n\r\nThe interest which this creature had inspired was not, however, of a\r\npleasant kind.  On the contrary, both looked upon it with feelings of\r\nrepugnance, almost amounting to awe; for it was in reality one of the\r\nugliest monsters to be met with in the great deep.\r\n\r\nIn size it it as about equal to the body of a man; but much more\r\nelongated, and lessening gradually towards the tail.  It seemed to\r\npossess a double quantity of fins,--lunated along their outer margins,\r\nand set thickly over its body, so as to give it a bristling aspect.\r\nUnlike other fishes, its neck was more slender than its head and\r\nshoulders,--imparting to it a sort of human shape.  But it was in its\r\nhead that the hideousness of the creature was more especially\r\nconspicuous; the skull being prolonged on each side outwards to the\r\ndistance of several inches, and set upon its neck after the fashion of a\r\nmallet upon its shaft!  At the end of these lateral protuberances\r\nappeared the eyes, with gleaming golden irides, glancing horridly to the\r\nright and left.\r\n\r\nThe mouth was not less abnormal in shape and position.  Instead of being\r\nin the hideous head already described, it was in the breast,--where at\r\nintervals it could be seen yawning wide open, and displaying a quadruple\r\nrow of sharp serrated teeth, that threatened instant destruction to any\r\nsubstance, however hard, that might chance to come between them.\r\n\r\nLittle William knew not what sort of fish it was; for though common\r\nenough in some parts of the ocean, he had not had the good or ill\r\nfortune to see one before.  As his companion had put the question,\r\nhowever,--and also to satisfy his own curiosity,--he appealed to Ben.\r\n\r\nThe latter, raising his eyes above the top of his chest, and looking in\r\nthe direction pointed out by the lad, at once recognised the animal\r\nwhich appeared to have attached itself as an escort to the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\n\"Hammer-head!\" said Ben; \"a shark he be; an' the ugliest o' his ugly\r\ntribe.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this, the sailor once more ducked his head under the lid of the\r\nchest, and continued his exploration,--altogether heedless of the\r\n\"hammer-head,\" from whose proximity they had nothing to fear.\r\n\r\nSo believed Ben Brace at the moment.\r\n\r\nIt proved a feeling of false security.  In less than ten minutes from\r\nthat time the sailor was within six feet of the \"hammer-head's\" open\r\nmouth,--in imminent danger of being craunched between those quadruple\r\ntiers of terrible teeth, and taken into the monster's capacious maw.\r\n\r\nBy the phrase \"hammer-head,\" so laconically pronounced by the captain of\r\nthe _Catamaran_, little William recognised in the fish a creature which,\r\nalthough never seen by him before, he had read of in books, both of\r\ntravel and natural history.  It was the \"hammer-head\" shark, or\r\n_balance-fish_, so-called from the peculiar formation of its head,--the\r\n_zygaena_ of the naturalists, and one of the most voracious of that\r\ndevouring tribe to which genetically it belongs.\r\n\r\nThe individual in question was, as is already stated, about a cable's\r\nlength from the raft, right ahead; and through the translucent water its\r\nform could be distinctly traced in all its hideous outlines.  Swimming\r\nin the same direction, and at a like rate of speed, it preserved a\r\nregular distance from the raft; and appeared like some guide or _avant\r\ncourier_ conducting the _Catamaran_ across the Atlantic!\r\n\r\nWilliam and Lalee watched the fish for a considerable time; but as no\r\nchange took place either in its movements or the position it held in\r\nrelation to the raft, their curiosity at length became satisfied, and\r\ntheir eyes were turned in a different direction.\r\n\r\nBut the gaze of the boy-sailor soon became fixed; and upon an object\r\nwhich caused him to give utterance to two distinct exclamations,--\r\ndistinct in point of time, as different in signification.  The first was\r\nan ejaculation, or rather a series of phrases expressing a jocular\r\nsurprise,--the second a cry of serious alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!\" cried he, on turning round and glancing towards the stern of the\r\n_Catamaran_, \"Snowball asleep!  Ha! ha! ha!  See the old sea-cook!\r\nVerily, that steering-oar has escaped from his hand!\"\r\n\r\nAlmost instantly succeeded the shout that betokened alarm, followed by a\r\nseries of hurried phrases, indicating the danger itself.\r\n\r\n\"The boom,--the boom!  'Tis coming round!  Look out, Lalee! look out!\"\r\n\r\nAs he gave utterance to these words of warnings the boy sprang towards\r\nhis companion, with arms outstretched, to protect her.\r\n\r\nThe action came too late.  The steering-oar, held in the hands of the\r\nsleeper, hung suspended high above the water.  The _Catamaran_, left\r\nwithout control, luffed suddenly round beam-end to the wind; the boom\r\nobeyed the impulse of the breeze; and Lilly Lalee, uplifted upon its\r\nend, was brushed off from the craft, and jerked far out upon the blue\r\nbosom of the ocean!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\n\"OVERBOARD!\"\r\n\r\nThe cry came from little William, as the Portuguese girl, lifted on the\r\nend of the boom, was pitched far out into the sea.\r\n\r\nThe utterance was merely mechanical; and as it escaped from his lips,\r\nthe sailor-lad rushed towards the edge of the raft, and placed himself\r\nin an attitude to plunge into the water,--with the design of swimming to\r\nthe rescue of Lalee.\r\n\r\nJust then the boom, suddenly recoiling, came back with a rapid sweep;\r\nand, striking him across the shins, sent him sprawling over the\r\nshoulders of Ben Brace, and right into the sea-chest, in front of which\r\nthe sailor was still kneeling.\r\n\r\nBen had heard that significant cry of alarm, and almost simultaneously\r\nthe \"plash\" made by the little Portuguese as her body dropped down upon\r\nthe water.  He had slewed himself round, and was making a hurried effort\r\nto get to his feet, when the boy, flung with violence upon his stooping\r\nback, once more brought him to his knees.\r\n\r\nAs William was chucked right over him into the chest the sailor soon\r\nrecovered from the shock, and rising erect, cried out in a half-confused\r\nmanner,--\"Overboard!  Who?  Where?  _Not_ you, Will'm!  What is't, boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"O Ben!  Ben!\" answered William, as he lay kicking among the contents of\r\nthe kit, \"Lilly Lalee, she's knocked overboard by the boom!  Save her!\r\nsave her!\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor needed neither the information nor the appeal thus addressed\r\nto him.  His interrogations had been altogether mechanical, for the\r\nplunge he had heard, and the absence of the girl from the raft,--\r\nascertained by a single glance,--told him which of the _Catamaran's_\r\ncrew it was who had fallen overboard.\r\n\r\nThe circling eddies in the water showed him the spot where the girl had\r\ngone down; but, just as he got to his feet again, she had turned to the\r\nsurface; and, uttering half-stifled screams, commenced buffeting the\r\nwater with her tiny hands, in an instinctive endeavour to keep herself\r\nafloat.\r\n\r\nIn a crisis of this character, the brave English sailor was obstructed\r\nby no ambiguity as to how he should act.  A single bound carried him\r\nacross the _Catamaran_,--another landed him upon the top of one of the\r\ncasks, and a third launched him six feet outward into the sea.  Had he\r\nbeen apprised of the accident only a score of seconds sooner, less than\r\nthat number of strokes would have sufficed him to reach the spot where\r\nthe child had first fallen into the water.  Unfortunately in the\r\ncollision with little William, that had brought him back to his knees,\r\nsome time had been expended.  During this interval--short as it was--the\r\ncraft, though under an uncontrolled sail, was still making considerable\r\nway; and when the rescuer at length succeeded in leaping from the cask,\r\nthe struggling form had fallen into the wake of the _Catamaran_ to the\r\ndistance of nearly a cable's length.\r\n\r\nIf the girl could only keep afloat for a few minutes, there need be no\r\ngreat danger.  The sailor knew that he could swim, sustaining a heavier\r\nweight than was the little Lalee.  But it was evident the child could\r\nnot swim a stroke, and was every moment in danger of sinking for the\r\nsecond time.\r\n\r\nHer rescuer perceived this danger as he started to her aid; and\r\ntherefore pressed rapidly towards her, cleaving the water with all the\r\nstrength that lay in his muscular arm and limbs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile little William had also regained his feet; and, having\r\nextricated himself from the chest in which he had been temporarily\r\nencoffined, ran towards the after part of the raft.  Quickly mounting\r\nupon the water-cask at the stern, he stood astride the steering-oar,--an\r\nanxious and trembling spectator,--his eyes alternately fixed on the\r\nstrong swimmer and the struggling child.\r\n\r\nSnowball was still dormant, buried in a slumber profound and\r\nunconscious,--such as only a \"darkey\" can enjoy.  The cry \"Overboard!\"\r\nuttered by little William had made no impression upon the tympanum of\r\nhis wide-spread ears,--nor the exclamations that succeeded in the\r\nharsher voice of the sailor.  Equally unheard by him had been the scream\r\ncoming across the water, though along with it he might have heard the\r\nutterance of his own name!\r\n\r\nAs none of these sounds had been sufficient to arouse him from his\r\ntorpor, he was likely to remain for some time longer unconscious of what\r\nwas occurring.  The sailor swam in silence,--the cries of the child, now\r\nmore distant, were growing feebler and feebler; while little William--\r\nSnowball's only companion upon the raft--was too much absorbed in the\r\nscene and its issue to allow even a breath to escape him.\r\n\r\nIn this moment of agony,--intense to all the others of the _Catamaran's_\r\ncrew,--Snowball was sleeping as soundly and sweetly as if he had been\r\nstretched along the bench of his caboose, and rocked to rest by the\r\nundulations of a good ship going at easy sail.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, William had not thought of awakening him; for, to say\r\nthe truth, the boy had not yet quite recovered his presence of mind.\r\nThe shock of consternation caused by the accident was still vibrating\r\nthrough his brain; and his actions, in running aft, and springing up on\r\nthe cask, were half mechanical.  There, enchained by the spectacle, and\r\nwaiting with intense anxiety for its _denouement_, he had not a thought\r\nto give either to Snowball or his slumberings.\r\n\r\nThe silence continued only for a short period of time, though it may\r\nhave seemed long enough both to actors and spectator in that thrilling\r\ndrama.  It was terminated by a cry of joyous import from the lips of\r\nlittle William,--in short, a loud _hurrah_, evoked by his seeing the\r\nswimmer come _en rapport_ with the child, raise her sinking form above\r\nthe surface, and holding it in one hand, strike out with the other in\r\nthe direction of the rail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nSAVED!\r\n\r\n\"Brave Ben!--brave fellow! he has saved her!  Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nWhether it was the violent gestures that accompanied this ebullition of\r\nfeeling that caused the water-cask to lurch from under his feet,--or\r\nwhether it arose from his nervous system suddenly becoming relaxed after\r\nsuch a spell of intense anxiety,--certain it is that the sailor-lad, as\r\nhe repeated the final \"Hurrah!\" lost his balance upon the task, and,\r\nstaggering over, he fell with all his weight upon the prostrate body of\r\nthe slumbering sea-cook.\r\n\r\nThe latter, in his sleep more sensible to touch than hearing, was at\r\nlength aroused.\r\n\r\n\"Gorramity!\" cried he, suddenly starting to his knees, and endeavouring\r\nto disembarrass himself of the weight of little William, still\r\nscrambling upon his back.  \"Gorramity!  What all dis _fracas_ 'bout?\r\nSomeb'dy shout `Hurrah?'--Ha! you, lilly Willy? you shout dat jess now?\r\nI tink I hear ye in ma 'leep.  What for you hurrah?  Golly! am dar a\r\nship in sight?  I hope dar am--Wha's Mass' Brace?--wha's de lilly gal?\r\nAugh?\"\r\n\r\nThis string of interrogations was put in such rapid succession as to\r\ngive the lad no opportunity of replying to them.  But, indeed, a reply\r\nwas not needed, as may be deduced from the final ejaculation of the\r\nquestioner.\r\n\r\nSnowball, having swept the surface of the _Catamaran_ with a quick,\r\nsearching glance, and missing from it not only its captain, but--what\r\nwas of greater moment--his own _protege_, became equally the victim of\r\nsurprise and consternation.\r\n\r\nHis eye was at once turned towards the water; and, like all men\r\naccustomed to the sea, was intuitively directed sternward.  The missing\r\nindividuals could not be elsewhere than in the wake of the craft going\r\nunder sail.\r\n\r\nHe was soon satisfied of the correctness of his conjecture.  On the\r\ninstant of his turning he beheld Ben Brace,--or rather, only the head of\r\nthat individual,--just visible above the rippling surface of the sea.\r\nClose by was another head, of smaller size, with dark ringlets floating\r\non both sides of it, and a tiny arm stretched out and apparently\r\nclinging to the shoulder of the seaman.\r\n\r\nSnowball needed no one--not even little William--to interpret what he\r\nsaw.  At a glance he comprehended what had occurred during his sleep,--\r\nall except the cause.  Little did he suspect that the disaster had its\r\norigin in his own negligence.  But it did not need that thought to beget\r\nwithin him a feeling of anxiety,--or, rather, of intense alarm.\r\n\r\nThis feeling did not arise on the instant.  Seeing the girl sustained by\r\nsuch a strong swimmer as he knew his old shipmate to be, he had but\r\nlittle fear for the result,--so little that he checked his first\r\nimpulse, which was to leap overboard and swim to the assistance of both.\r\n\r\nA moment's reflection, however, satisfied him that there was still\r\ndanger both for Lalee and her brave rescuer,--a danger which little\r\nWilliam while giving utterance to that joyful \"Hurrah!\" had not taken\r\ninto account.  The lad had seen the girl picked up by the strong seaman;\r\nand, having an unlimited faith in the prowess of his own protector, he\r\nhad no other thought than that the latter would soon swim back to the\r\n_Catamaran_, bearing his light burden along with him.\r\n\r\nIn his joy little William had overlooked the circumstance that the\r\n_Catamaran_ was _under sail_, and moving through the water at a rate of\r\nspeed that the swiftest swimmer, unembarrassed with the slightest\r\nweight, might in vain attempt to overtake her!\r\n\r\nThis sinister circumstance, in the excitement of the hour overlooked by\r\nthe youthful sailor, was even, for a moment, unthought of by the more\r\nexperienced mariner,--for Snowball, in addition to being a sea-cook, was\r\nalso a competent seaman.  Not for long, however, did the latter continue\r\nunconscious of the danger.  Almost on the instant did he perceive it;\r\nand quickly squatting himself in front of the cask, he took hold of the\r\nsteering-oar,--which he had so culpably neglected,--and, although still\r\nignorant of the fact that his own negligence had caused the disaster, he\r\nbent all his energies towards remedying it.\r\n\r\nUnder the strong arm of the Coromantee, the _Catamaran_ was fast coming\r\nround towards the wind,--and so shortening the distance between the\r\nswimmer and the craft,--when an object came under the eye of her\r\nsteersman that caused him to drop the oar as if either his arm had\r\nbecome suddenly paralysed, or the piece of rounded ash grasped between\r\nhis hands had become transformed into a bar of red-hot iron!\r\n\r\nThe former it could not be; since paralysed arms could not act, as did\r\nthose of Snowball on that instant.  On dropping the oar, his right hand\r\nwas suddenly carried towards his left thigh, where a long knife hung\r\nsuspended in its sheath.  Upon the hilt of this his fingers rested for a\r\nmoment, evidently not with the intention of drawing it, but apparently\r\nto assure himself that the knife was in its place.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the hand was withdrawn; but during the action the negro\r\nhad hastily risen to his feet; and, having already abandoned the oar, he\r\nrushed towards the edge of the raft and leaped overboard into the water!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nTHE ZYGAENA.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the Coromantee in thus relinquishing the rudder and\r\nspringing overboard into the sea was inexplicable,--at least, to little\r\nWilliam it seemed so for the time.  What could be Snowball's object in\r\ntaking to the water?  The sailor's strength was sufficient to sustain\r\nboth himself and the little girl.  He appeared to have no difficulty in\r\nholding her above the surface; and as to getting back to the raft,\r\nSnowball was surely doing more service in steering the raft towards\r\nthem?  Had he continued at the rudder a few minutes longer, the\r\n_Catamaran_ must have come very near where the swimmer was struggling;\r\nwhere as, on his dropping the oar, she once more luffed round, and began\r\nto make way in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nLittle William, however, did not observe this sinister circumstance; or\r\nif he did, it was for the moment driven out of his mind by one still\r\nmore sinister, that just then came under his observation.\r\n\r\nOnly for a few seconds had he remained watching the negro, and\r\nwondering, with unpleasant thoughts, why the latter before leaping\r\noverboard had half drawn the knife from his belt and then resheathed it.\r\nSomething like a suspicion passed through the mind of the youth.  What\r\ncould the negro want with a knife, if his object was to give help to the\r\nswimmer?  Could a fiendish conception have occurred to the Coromantee,\r\nto lessen the number of those who might require food and water?\r\n\r\nIt is true the suspicion had barely shaped itself in the brain of the\r\nboy.  Still, it had shaped itself, to be succeeded by a feeling of\r\nremorse for the wrong which he had done to Snowball in entertaining it.\r\nAlmost on the instant did he become conscious of this wrong, by an\r\nobject coming under his eyes and which at once accounted for the conduct\r\nof the Coromantee, that had seemed strange.  Snowball was swimming\r\ntowards Ben Brace,--not to destroy,--but with the intention of saving\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFrom what?  Was the sailor really in danger of sinking, so as to stand\r\nin need of support both for himself and his burden?\r\n\r\nLittle William did not put such an interrogatory.  All his conjectures\r\nwere ended.  The peril threatening his patron,--and little Lalee as\r\nwell,--was plainly outlined before his eyes, in all its frightful\r\nreality.  That flattish, dark disc, with lunetted edge, rising erect\r\nabove the surface, and cutting keenly through the rippling water, was an\r\nobject not to be mistaken for any moving thing met with amid the ocean,\r\nsave the dorsal fin of a shark, and William knew at a glance that such\r\nin reality it was.\r\n\r\nHe saw, moreover, it was the same he and little Lalee had so late been\r\ncontemplating in security,--the dreaded zygaena: for through the\r\ntranslucent water he could distinguish its hammer-shaped head, and lurid\r\neyes gleaming out from their protuberant sockets,--hideous to behold!\r\n\r\nThe boy now became spectator,--sole spectator,--of a scene of thrilling,\r\neven terrible interest.  The characters in the drama were Snowball, the\r\nzygaena, and Ben Brace with his burden.\r\n\r\nJust as William had arrived at the comprehension of the Coromantee's\r\nbehaviour, the _dramatis persona_ were placed relatively to each other\r\nin a triangular position,--an isosceles triangle, in which Snowball and\r\nthe shark represented the angles at the base, while Ben with his charge\r\noccupied the apex.  The latter point was almost stationary, while both\r\nthe former were moving towards it in converging lines, fast as shark and\r\nman could swim.\r\n\r\nThe situation was easily explained.  The zygaena, hitherto holding its\r\ncourse ahead of the _Catamaran_, had become apprised of the catastrophe\r\noccurring among the crew.  The plash occasioned by little Lalee as she\r\nwas flung upon the water, and the heavier concussion of Ben's body as he\r\nplunged overboard, had reached the monster's ears; and, with that fell\r\ninstinct peculiar to its tribe, it had suddenly turned in the water, and\r\ncommenced swimming toward the wake of the craft; where it knew that\r\nanything, whether human or otherwise, falling overboard, must inevitably\r\ndrift.\r\n\r\nWhile passing the _Catamaran_ towards the wake, Snowball had caught\r\nsight of its fan-like fin,--which apprised him of the direction it was\r\ntaking, at the same time revealing to him its design.\r\n\r\nThe plunge which Snowball had made as he sprang out into the water had\r\ncaused the zygaena to swerve from its course; and for some moments it\r\nswam towards _him_, as if determined upon changing the object of its\r\nattack; but whether not liking the looks of the Coromantee or frayed by\r\nhis bold attitude in making directly towards it, it shied back into its\r\nformer course, and kept on towards the others.\r\n\r\nOf course, the sailor, encumbered as he was by the half-lifeless form of\r\nthe girl, would stand but little chance of making a successful defence\r\nagainst a shark,--more especially such a monster as the zygaena; and it\r\nwas the knowledge of this that had summoned Snowball to the rescue.\r\n\r\nAgainst such an adversary a more capable combatant than the Coromantee\r\ncould scarce have been found on the waters of the ocean, or even _in_\r\nthem.  He could swim like a swan, and dive like a sea-duck; nor was it\r\nthe first time for him to have fought the shark in its own element;\r\nneither would it be the first time should he prove conqueror in the\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\nOn launching into the lists, his chief dread had not been for himself,\r\nbut for those he was proceeding to rescue.\r\n\r\nIn point of time the shark had had the start of him; and, although on\r\nparting from the raft the distances each would have to traverse were not\r\nvery unequal, Snowball knew that his scaly competitor far excelled him\r\nin the quality of speed.\r\n\r\nIt was this thought that was causing him anxiety,--amounting almost to\r\nanguish,--that caused him to plunge wildly through the water,--to utter\r\nloud cries, and make other noisy demonstrations,--with a view of\r\ndistracting the attention of the zygaena from the victims it had\r\nfore-chosen, and drawing its attack upon himself.\r\n\r\nHis shouts and gesticulations proved equally unavailing.  The cunning\r\nzygaena took no heed of either; but with its dark dorsal fin, set like a\r\nwell-bent sail, it kept straight on towards the easier victims.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the isosceles triangle were gradually growing unequal,--\r\ngradually and slowly, but, alas! surely.  Already was it an irregular\r\n_scalene_.  Snowball perceived the change,--each moment becoming more\r\nperceptible, each moment augmenting his fears.\r\n\r\n\"Poor lilly Lally!\" cried he, in a voice that betrayed his anxiety.  \"O\r\nMass' Ben! fo' de lub o' Gorramity, swum to de right,--round dat away,\r\nan' let me git 'tween you an de ravenin' beast.  To de right!--da's de\r\nway.  Do yer bess, Mass' Brace, an' gi' me time get up.  I take care o'\r\nde lubber ef I once get im widin reach o' dis chile's arm.\"\r\n\r\nThe injunction thus uttered had the desired effect.  Up to that time the\r\nsailor, sunk low in the water by reason of the extra weight, had not\r\nbecome fully cognisant of the peril of his position.  Hitherto his mind\r\nhad been more occupied with the idea of overtaking the raft, than any\r\ndanger to be dreaded from sharks.  He was not even aware of the\r\nzygaena's approach; for the fin, which had betrayed the monster's\r\npresence to those on the _Catamaran_,--from being seen _en profile_,--\r\ncould not so easily be distinguished when viewed in \"front-face.\"  No\r\nwonder, therefore, that the victims which the zygaena had selected for\r\nits attack remained unconscious of its approach; and it was only on\r\nseeing Snowball spring out from the _Catamaran_, and swim towards him,\r\nthat the sailor suspected the proximity of a shark.  At the same\r\ninstant, also, he remembered the interrogatory that had been addressed\r\nto him by little William, and his own laconic reply designating the\r\nindividual as a _hammer-head_.  From these various circumstances he\r\ncould tell that there was a shark bearing down upon him; but in what\r\ndirection he could not conjecture, until the hurried words of Snowball\r\nadmonished him to \"make way to de right.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor had too much respect for the experience of the ex-cook to\r\ndisregard the injunctions thus given; and of hearing them, he at once\r\nswerved in the direction indicated, and \"made way to de right\" as fast\r\nas a man could swim with only one hand free for the stroke.\r\n\r\nFortunately for all parties, the one arm proved sufficient.  The new\r\ndirection entered upon by the swimmer soon changed the relative position\r\nof all parties.  The triangle became resolved into a right line,--the\r\nshark at one extremity,--the sailor with his charge at the other,--\r\nSnowball midway between!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nFACE TO FACE.\r\n\r\nBy this change in the position of the parties, the zygaena had lost its\r\nadvantage.  Instead of having for the object of its attack an exhausted\r\nswimmer encumbered with a weight, without a weapon, or even an arm free\r\nto wield one, it would now have for its antagonist a strong man,--fresh\r\nand vigorous,--armed with a long-bladed knife; one, moreover, who from\r\nearliest youth had lived a half-amphibious life, and who was almost as\r\nmuch at home in the water as the shark itself.  At all events, the\r\nCoromantee could calculate on keeping himself _above_ water for several\r\nhours without rest, and _under_ it as long as any other animal whose\r\nnatural element was the earth or the air.\r\n\r\nSnowball, however, had no intention to go _wider_,--not an inch deeper\r\nthan he could possibly help: for therein would lie his danger, and he\r\nknew it.  As we have already said, it was not the first time for him to\r\nencounter a shark in its own element; and though, perhaps, not so\r\nfamilial with the _hammer-head_ as with the white shark, he was not\r\naltogether unacquainted with the habits and peculiarities of the former\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nHe knew that the zygaena, like others of its congeners, in seizing an\r\nobject, requires to have that object _under_ it; otherwise, it is\r\ncompelled to turn upon its back or side, just in proportion as the prey\r\nit would seize lies high or low in the water.  If altogether on the\r\nsurface, the shark is forced to make a complete roll, belly upward; and\r\nthis necessity,--arising from the peculiar position of the animal's\r\nmouth, and the conformation of its jaws,--is well-known among mariners,\r\nand better among true shark-fighters, who use it to their advantage.\r\nAmong the pearl-divers of the Vermilion Sea (Gulf of California), the\r\nattack of the common shark is but little dreaded.  The only weapon used\r\nby them is a piece of stick (the _estaca_), sharpened at both ends, and\r\nhardened by fire.  Provided with this simple weapon, which they carry,\r\nstuck through a loop in their leathern belt, they dive without fear\r\namong the sharks that frequent the waters of the pearl-oyster fishery.\r\nWhen attacked by one of these voracious creatures, they wait for the\r\nmoment when the shark makes its semi-somersault, and opens its cavernous\r\nmouth.  Then, with an adroitness drawn from practice, and a fearlessness\r\nwhich only great confidence can give, they thrust the _estaca_,\r\ngag-fashion, between the creature's jaws, leaving it no alternative but\r\nto retreat with its jaws wide open, or to close them to its own certain\r\ndestruction.  Among these pearl-fisheries, however, a species of shark\r\noccasionally shows itself that cannot be destroyed in such a simple\r\nfashion.  It is known as the _tintorera_, and is as much dreaded by the\r\npearl-divers as the common shark is by the ordinary mariner.\r\n\r\nFierce as is the zygaena and dreaded above all others of its tribe,--\r\nhalf the dread no doubt is attributable to its hideous configuration.\r\nSnowball knew that before it could injure him, it must make the\r\nhalf-turn, and, therefore, approached it with the determination to keep\r\nwell upon the surface of the water, and not let it get above him.\r\n\r\nThe conflict was now inevitable: for the shark, although apparently a\r\nlittle put about by the transposition that had taken place, had\r\ndetermined upon having a meal of human flesh.  Its white victims had\r\nescaped it for the time, but it was not particular as to the colour of\r\nthe skin, and Snowball might be as sweet to its palate as Ben Brace or\r\nLilly Lalee.\r\n\r\nWe are not going to assert that it reasoned after this fashion, or that\r\nany thoughts whatever passed through its huge mallet-shaped skull.\r\nIndeed, there was not much time for reflection: for as Snowball\r\ninterposed his body between the zygaena and its intended victims, the\r\nwoolly head of the Coromantee and the hammer-head of the shark were\r\nscarcely three lengths of a handspike from each other.\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful situation for a human being to be in; and any other\r\nthan an old shark-fighter would, at such a moment, have succumbed from\r\nsheer terror.\r\n\r\nNot so Snowball, who appeared to enter the lists with as little dread\r\nand as much confidence as if his _fetisch_ had given him full assurance\r\nof victory.\r\n\r\nLittle William, standing upon the stern of the _Catamaran_ with\r\nsuspended breath, noting every turn of the spectacle, could see Snowball\r\ndrawing the knife from his belt.  Not for long, however, did he hold it\r\nclutched in his hand.  For greater convenience, and to give his hands\r\nfree play, while evading the attacks of his finny antagonist, he\r\ntransferred the knife to his mouth, where it was seen set transversely\r\nacross his cheeks, the blade tightly held between his teeth.  In this\r\nstrange fashion did Snowball meet his enemy,--the truculent tyrant of\r\nthe deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nA RING PERFORMANCE.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that the shark would have rushed instantaneously\r\nupon its antagonist, regardless of aught save making a meal of him.  But\r\nno, the zygaena, notwithstanding its great voracity, like the rest of\r\nits tribe, is endowed with certain instincts of caution.  The sea-tiger,\r\nas well as that of the land, can tell instinctively whether the object\r\nof its attack is likely to become an easy prey, or turn out a dangerous\r\nadversary.\r\n\r\nSome such--shall we call it an idea?--seemed to enter the unshapely\r\nskull of the hammer-head,--suggested no doubt by the bold attitude which\r\nSnowball had assumed.  In all likelihood, had the negro been making\r\naway, instead of swimming towards it, and showing signs of a desire to\r\nescape, its onset would have been made on the instant.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the shark saw itself _vis-a-vis_ to an adversary nearly as\r\nlarge as itself and quite as courageous; and it is possible also that\r\nits pilot-fish,--a brace of which had advanced close to Snowball's\r\nsnout, and after submitting his dusky carcass to a brief examination\r\nreturned to their master,--it is just possible that these emissaries had\r\nreported to their patron, that the game he was in pursuit of must be\r\napproached with caution.\r\n\r\nAt all events something had been communicated that produced a sudden\r\nchange in the tactics of the zygaena.  Instead of rushing recklessly on\r\nto the attack,--or even keeping up the swimming pace by which it had\r\nhitherto been making its approach,--on arriving within some half-score\r\nfathoms of Snowball's face, it gradually slackened speed, until its\r\nbrown, fan-like fins, gently oscillating along its sides seemed no\r\nlonger to propel its body through the water.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on drawing nearer, it swerved slightly from its course,--as if\r\nwith the design either of attacking its adversary in the rear, or\r\npassing him altogether!\r\n\r\nStrange enough, the two parasites appeared to direct this movement: for\r\nboth kept swimming alongside the zygaena, one of them opposite each of\r\nits huge eyeballs.\r\n\r\nThe negro seemed slightly perplexed by this unexpected manoeuvre.  He\r\nhad anticipated an instantaneous attack, and had made every preparation\r\nto receive and repel it.  He had even taken the knife from his teeth,\r\nand was holding it tightly clutched in his right hand, ready to deal his\r\ndeadly blow.\r\n\r\nThe shyness of the shark produced a disappointment.\r\n\r\nSomething besides: for it now occurred to Snowball that the cunning\r\nzygaena was trying to pass him, with the design of making a _razzia_\r\ntowards the helpless party in his rear.\r\n\r\nThe moment this suspicion arose to him he turned short in the water, and\r\nstruck out in a direction that would enable him to head the shark, and,\r\nif possible, intercept it.\r\n\r\nWhether the creature intended to pursue his original plan of attacking\r\nthe sailor and his charge, or whether he was manoeuvring to _turn_ the\r\nCoromantee, it mattered not.  In either case Snowball was pursuing the\r\ncorrect strategy.  He knew that if his supple antagonist could once get\r\nround to his rear, his chances of safety for himself or the others would\r\nbe sadly diminished.  Should the zygaena once get past him and continue\r\non towards the sailor, swift swimmer as Snowball was, he could have no\r\nchance of overtaking a fish.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis a thought occurred to him which promised to avert the\r\ncalamity he most dreaded,--that is, the shark getting past him, and\r\ncontinuing on to the others.  The thought found expression in speech.\r\n\r\n\"Ho!  Massa Brace!\" he cried, once more taking the steel from between\r\nhis teeth.  \"Swim roun' to de right.  Keep a-gwine in de circle.  For de\r\nLord sake, keep ahind me, or you loss fo' sartin!\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor scarcely needed the counsel.  He saw the danger before\r\nSnowball had spoken, and had already commenced the movement which the\r\nCoromantee was requesting him to make.\r\n\r\nOnce more the tableau changed.  The _dramatis persona_ in their relative\r\npositions first formed an isosceles triangle, then a scalene, afterwards\r\na right line.  Now all were moving in a circle, or rather in three\r\ncircles concentric to one another; the sailor, with his charge,\r\nrevolving round the centre, Snowball in mid radius, while the shark,\r\nflanked by his satellites, went gliding along the outer circumference,\r\nhis lurid eyes glaring continually inward, as if watching for an\r\nopportunity to break the line so carefully guarded by the Coromantee!\r\n\r\nFor full five minutes was this \"ring\" performance kept up, without any\r\ngreat alteration occurring in the relative positions of the parties.\r\nBut it was a game in which the outside player had all the advantage;\r\nfor, although the zygaena had by far the greater distance to traverse,\r\nwhat was but sport to it was fatigue and the danger of drowning to its\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\nHad its skull been of a different formation, and filled with a better\r\nset of brains, it would have endeavoured to keep up that game, without\r\nin the least degree changing the mode of playing it.  In due time, its\r\nchief antagonist, Snowball, must have cried quarter or gone to the\r\nbottom; and far sooner must have sunk the weighted swimmer in his wake.\r\n\r\nBut sharks, like other creatures both aquatic and terrestrial, have\r\ntheir moments of impatience and anger; and the zygaena, yielding to\r\nthese passions, common to both piscine and human nature, at length\r\ndetermined to break through the rules of the game, and bring the play to\r\nan abrupt termination.\r\n\r\nIn obedience to this impulse, it suddenly swerved from its circular\r\ncourse, and, heading towards the spot where Ben Brace, with Lilly Lalee\r\nclinging to his shoulder, was performing his shorter revolutions, it\r\nmade a reckless and determined rush for the centre,--equally regardless\r\nof the admonition of its brace of monitors and the cold steel of the\r\nCoromantee, gleaming clear under the water through which it would have\r\nto make its way.  So near had it to pass to the negro's flat nose that\r\nits glutinous skin would be almost in contact with his prominent lips,\r\nand with his outstretched hand he need have no difficulty in striking\r\nhis slippery antagonist.\r\n\r\nHad Snowball been anticipating this change of tactics, he could not have\r\nacted more adroitly, or with greater promptness.  As the zygaena was\r\ngliding onward, and just as its rough _pectoral_ passed within an inch\r\nof his nose, he suddenly returned the knife between his teeth, and,\r\nsimultaneously using both hands and limbs, he sprang upward in the\r\nwaiter, and, with a vigorous effort, launched himself on its back!\r\n\r\nIn the next instant he was seen,--or might have been seen,--with one\r\nhand, the left, firmly grasping the bony protuberance of the zygaena's\r\nleft eye, his muscular fingers deeply imbedded in the socket, while his\r\nright, clutching the long knife, was inflicting a series of stabs\r\nagainst the side of his adversary, now flashing high in the air, now\r\ngleaming under water, going up and down with all the measured regularity\r\nof a trip-hammer.\r\n\r\nWhen it pleased the Coromantee to dismount from his slippery saddle, the\r\nzygaena floated by his side,--a carcass stained with its own blood, that\r\nfor fathoms around encrimsoned the azure waters of the ocean!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE CHASE OF THE CATAMARAN.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, little William, standing near the stern of the\r\n_Catamaran_, had watched the spectacle with suspended breath.  It was\r\nonly after seeing the zygaena float lifeless on the water, and becoming\r\nsatisfied that Snowball had come out of the struggle safe as well as\r\nvictorious, that the boy gave utterance to a shout.  Then, unable longer\r\nto restrain himself, he raised a cry of joyful exultation.\r\n\r\nIt was neither prolonged nor repeated.  It had scarce passed his lips,\r\nere it was succeeded by another of very different import.  This was the\r\nvery opposite to a shout of joy: rather was it a cry of consternation.\r\nThat little drama of the ocean, of which he had been the sole spectator,\r\nwas not yet over.  There was another act to come of equally thrilling\r\ninterest with that just ended,--an act in which he himself would be\r\ncalled upon to play an important part along with the others.\r\n\r\nIt had already commenced; and the wild cry which escaped from the lips\r\nof the sailor-lad announced his first perception of the new phase into\r\nwhich the drama had entered.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in the contemplation of the combat between Snowball and the\r\nshark, he had hitherto remained unobservant of a circumstance of the\r\nmost alarming character,--one that threatened not only the destruction\r\nof the Coromantee, but Ben Brace as well, and Lilly Lalee, and in time\r\nlittle William himself,--in short, of the whole party.\r\n\r\nThe lives of all were at that moment in the hands of the sailor-lad, or\r\nif not in his hands, then were all of them doomed to certain\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nYou may be wondering what strange circumstance this was, fraught with\r\nsuch a terrible contingency.  There was nothing mysterious in or about\r\nit.  It was simply that the _Catamaran_, carrying its large spread sail,\r\nwas drifting to leeward, and rapidly increasing the distance between\r\nitself and the swimmers.\r\n\r\nRelieved from the anxiety with which he had regarded the conflict,\r\nlittle William at once became aware of this new danger,--hence his cry\r\nof consternation.  Ben Brace either perceived it at the same instant, or\r\nelse the shout of his _protege_ had drawn his attention to it; for,\r\nquick succeeding the latter, the voice of the sailor went rolling across\r\nthe water in words of direction intended for the ears of little William.\r\n\r\n\"Will'm!  Will'm!\" shouted he, raising his lips above the surface so as\r\nto enunciate more distinctly.  \"For marcy's sake, lad, lay hold on the\r\nsteerin' oar.  Try to tack round, or we're lost one an' all o' us!\"\r\n\r\nAt the same instant Snowball sputtered out some very similar orders; but\r\nbeing sadly out of breath from his exertions in the long-continued\r\nstruggle with the zygaena, what proceeded from his mouth less resembled\r\nwords than the snorting of a porpoise; and was, in truth, altogether\r\nunintelligible.\r\n\r\nLittle William needed no instructions,--neither to hear nor understand\r\nthem.  He had perceived the danger, and, with intuitive promptness, had\r\ncommenced taking measures to avoid it.  Partly guided by his own\r\nthoughts and partly by the directions of Ben Brace, he sprang suddenly\r\ntowards the steering-oar; and, grasping it in both hands, he worked with\r\nall his might to bring the _Catamaran_ about.  After a time he succeeded\r\nin getting her head as close to the wind as such a craft was capable of\r\nsailing, but it soon became evident to him that the manoeuvre would be\r\nof little or no avail.  Although the raft did not make leeway quite as\r\nmuch as before, still with its great sail, rudely bent as it was, she\r\nmade sufficient to preserve the distance from the swimmers; and, as\r\nWilliam anxiously observed, still slightly increasing.  Even Snowball,\r\nwho, after giving the _coup de grace_ to the zygaena, had struck direct\r\ntowards the _Catamaran_,--even he, unencumbered by aught save his wet\r\nshirt and trousers, although easily passing the others in his course,\r\ndid not appear to gain an inch upon the runaway raft.\r\n\r\nIt was an anxious time for all parties; and the anxiety reached its\r\nheight when they perceived, as one and all soon did, that the\r\nunmanageable craft was keeping its distance, if not gaining a greater.\r\n\r\nThat state of things could not continue long.  Both the swimmers had\r\nalready begun to show signs of flagging.  Snowball, sea-duck that he\r\nwas, might have held out a good while; but the sailor, weighted with\r\nLalee, must soon \"go under.\"  Even Snowball could not swim forever; and,\r\nunless some incident should arise to change the character of this\r\naquatic chase, and arrest the _Catamaran_ in her leeward course, sooner\r\nor later must the Coromantee become also the prey of the all-swallowing\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes--they seemed hours to all--did the struggle continue\r\nbetween man and _Catamaran_, without any very great advantage in favour\r\nof either.  It is true some change had taken place in the relative\r\npositions of the parties.  The Coromantee, at starting in pursuit of the\r\nraft, had been some fathoms in the wake of Ben Brace and his _protege_.\r\nThey were now in his wake, falling, alas! still farther behind him.\r\nUnfortunately for all, Snowball, while increasing his distance from\r\nthem, was not lessening it from the _Catamaran_; and therefore the\r\nadvantage he was gaining over the sailor could be of no use, so long as\r\nthe raft proved swifter as a sailer than he was as a swimmer.\r\n\r\nSnowball's original idea in striking out in pursuit of the _Catamaran_\r\nwas to get aboard; and, by making a better use of the steering-oar than\r\nhe had hitherto done, to bring the craft back within _saving_ distance\r\nof the exhausted swimmer.  Confident in his natatory powers, he had at\r\nfirst believed this feat to be not only possible, but probable and easy.\r\nIt was only after several minutes spent in the pursuit, and the\r\ndistance between him and the _Catamaran_ seemed to grow greater instead\r\nof less, that the negro really began to feel anxiety about the result.\r\n\r\nThis anxiety kept increasing as the minutes passed, and the broad\r\nstretch of blue water between him and the _Catamaran_ appeared to grow\r\nno narrower, strike out as he would with all the strength of his sinewy\r\narms, and kick as he might with all the muscular energy that lay in his\r\nstout legs.\r\n\r\nHis anxiety became anguish, when, after one of his most vigorous\r\nefforts, he believed, or fancied, that all had been in vain, and that\r\nthe _Catamaran_ had actually gained upon him.  Whether fancy or not, it\r\nproduced conviction in his mind that to overtake the craft was\r\nimpossible; and all at once he discontinued the attempt.  He did not,\r\nhowever, remain stationary in the water.  Far from that.  On abandoning\r\nthe pursuit of the _Catamaran_, he turned like an otter, and looked back\r\nin the direction from which he had come.  In this direction, nearly two\r\nhundred fathoms distant, two dark objects, so close together as to seem\r\none, were visible over the \"curl\" of the water.\r\n\r\nThey were just visible to an eye elevated several inches above the\r\nsurface; and Snowball was obliged to buoy himself into an erect\r\nattitude,--like a seal taking a survey of the circle around it, or a dog\r\npitched unexpectedly into a deep pond,--before he could see them.\r\n\r\nHe saw them, however; he knew what they were; and, without a moment's\r\npause or hesitation, he recommenced cleaving the water in a line leading\r\ndirectly towards them.\r\n\r\nThe mind of the Coromantee, hitherto distracted by conflicting emotions,\r\nhad now but one thought.  It was less purpose than a despairing\r\ninstinct.  It was to support the child who had been intrusted to him--\r\nthe Lilly Lalee--above water as long as he should have strength; and\r\nthen to go down along with her into that vast, fathomless tomb, that\r\nleaves no trace and carries no epitaph!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE SAIL OUT OF SIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe sea-cook and the sailor were now swimming towards each other.  It is\r\ntrue that Ben was not making very rapid way, nor did Snowball return on\r\nhis course with any great alacrity.  Despair had rendered the latter\r\nsomewhat irresolute; and he scarcely knew why he was swimming back,\r\nunless it was to be drowned in company with the others; for drowning now\r\nappeared their inevitable fate.\r\n\r\nSlowly as both swam, they soon came together,--the countenances of both,\r\nas they met, exhibiting that fixed, despairing look which bespeaks the\r\nutter extinction of hope.\r\n\r\nThe _Catamaran_ was now at such a distance, that even could she have\r\nbeen suddenly arrested in her course, and brought to an anchor, it was\r\ndoubtful whether either Snowball or the sailor could have reached her by\r\nswimming.  The raft itself and the water-casks lashed around it were no\r\nlonger to be seen.  Only the white sail, that like a bit of fleecy\r\ncloud, equally fleeting, was fast lessening to a speck upon the distant\r\nhorizon.  No wonder that hope had forsaken them!\r\n\r\nThe sailor wondered that the sail was still set.  During the first\r\nmoments, while endeavouring to come up with the craft, he had shouted to\r\nWilliam to let go the halliards.  He had kept repeating this order,\r\nuntil his voice, already hoarse and faltering, grew almost inarticulate\r\nfrom sheet exhaustion of breath, and the rail, moreover, had drifted to\r\nsuch a distance that it was not likely the lad could hear him.  Under\r\nthis impression he had at length discontinued his feeble cries, and swam\r\non in slow and gloomy silence, wondering why William had not obeyed his\r\ninjunctions, feeling chagrin at his not doing so, and with good reason,\r\nsince the lowering of the sail might have still given them some chance\r\nof overtaking the craft.\r\n\r\nIt was just as the sailor had given over calling out, and relapsed into\r\nsullen silence, that Snowball was seen returning towards him.  It was an\r\nadditional argument for despair this abandonment of the chase on the\r\npart of the Coromantee.  When such a swimmer had given it up, Ben knew\r\nit was hopeless.\r\n\r\nIn a moment after they met face to face.  The glance exchanged between\r\nthem was mutually understood without a word spoken by either.  Each\r\ntacitly read in the eyes of the other the dread destiny that awaited\r\nthem,--near, and soon to be fulfilled,--drowning!\r\n\r\nSnowball was the first to break the terrible silence.\r\n\r\n\"You nigh done up, Massa Ben,--you muss be!  Gib me de lilly gal.  You\r\nLally! you lay hold on ma shoulder, and let Massa Brace ress a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--no!\" protested the sailor, in a despairing tone.  \"It bean't no\r\nuse.  I can carry her a bit longer.  'Tain't much longer as any o' us\r\n'll be--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh!  Massa Brace,\" interrupted the negro, speaking in a suppressed\r\nwhisper, and looking significantly towards the child.  \"Hope dar 's no\r\ndanger yet,\" he added, in a voice intended for the ear of Lalee.  \"We\r\noberhaul de _Catamaran_ by 'm by.  De wind change, and bring dat craff\r\ndown on us.  'Peak in de French, Massa Ben,\" he continued, at the same\r\ntime adroitly adopting a _patois_ of that language.  \"De _pauvre jeune\r\nfille_ don't understan' de French lingo.  I know it am all ober wi' boaf\r\nyou an' me, and de gal, too but doan let her know it to de lass minute.\r\nIt be no use to do dat,--only make her feel wuss.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Eh bien_! all right!\" muttered Ben, indiscriminately mingling his\r\nFrench and English phrases.  \"_Pauvre enfant_!  She shan't know nothin'\r\nfrom me o' what be afore her.  Lord a marcy on all o' us!  I don't see\r\nthe raft any more!  Whar be it?  Can you see it, Snowball?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gorramity, no!\" replied the black, raising himself up in the water to\r\nget a better view.  \"Gone out o' de sight altogedder!  We nebba see dat\r\n_Catamaran_ any more,--no, nebba!\"\r\n\r\nThe additional accent of despair with which these words were uttered was\r\nscarce perceptible.  Had there been a hope, it would have been shattered\r\nby the disappearance of the raft,--whose white sail was now no longer\r\nvisible against the blue background of the horizon.  But all hope had\r\npreviously been abandoned; and this new phase of the drama produced but\r\nslight change in the minds of its chief actors.  Death was already\r\nstaring them in the face with that determination which promised no\r\nprospect of avoiding it, and none was cherished.  The only change that\r\noccurred was in the action.  The swimmers no longer directed themselves\r\nin a particular course.  There was none for them to follow.  With the\r\ndisappearance of the sail they no longer knew in what direction to look\r\nfor the raft.  For all they now knew of it, it might have gone to the\r\nbottom, leaving them alone upon the bosom of the limitless ocean.\r\n\r\n\"No use swimmin' on'ards!\" said Ben, despairingly.  \"It'll only waste\r\nthe bit of strength that be left us.\"\r\n\r\n\"No use,\" assented the negro.  \"Less lay to, and float on de water.  Dat\r\nbe easier, and we can keep up de longer.  Do, Massa Ben,--gib me de gal.\r\nYou mo' tired dan I.  Come, lilly Lally, you grasp hold on ma shoulder!\r\nDat's de bess way.  Come, now,--come, dear lilly gal.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as Snowball spoke, he swam close alongside the girl and, gently\r\ndetaching her hand from the shoulder of the sailor, transferred its\r\nfeeble grasp to his own.\r\n\r\nBen no longer offered resistance to this generous action on the part of\r\nhis old comrade: for, in truth, he stood in dire necessity of the\r\nrelief; and, the transfer having been effected, both continued to float\r\nupon the water, sustaining themselves with no more effort than was\r\nabsolutely necessary to keep their heads above the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nWAITING FOR DEATH.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes the wretched castaways of the _Catamaran_ remained\r\nin their perilous position,--almost motionless in the midst of the deep\r\nblue water,--precariously suspended upon its surface,--suspended between\r\nlife and death!\r\n\r\nUnder any circumstances the situation would have been trying to the\r\nstoutest nerves,--even under circumstances where a hope of deliverance\r\nmight have been indulged in.  Without this it was awful.\r\n\r\nNeither black man nor white one any longer contemplated the _danger_ of\r\ndeath: both believed in its _certainty_.\r\n\r\nHow could they doubt it?\r\n\r\nHad either been standing upon the scaffold, with the condemned cap drawn\r\nover his eyes and the rope adjusted around his neck, he could not have\r\nfelt surer of the nearness of his end.\r\n\r\nBoth believed it to be simply a question of time; an hour or two,--\r\nperhaps not so much, since the fatigues and struggles through which they\r\nhad just passed had already made sad inroads upon their strength,--but\r\nan hour or two at most, and all would be over.  Both must succumb to the\r\nlaws of Nature,--the laws of gravitation,--or rather of specific\r\ngravity,--and sink below the surface,--down, down into the fathomless\r\nand unknown abysm of the ocean.  Along with them, sharing their sad\r\nfate, Lilly Lalee,--that pretty, uncomplaining child, the innocent\r\nvictim of an ill-starred destiny, must disappear forever from a world of\r\nwhich she had as yet seen so little, and that little of the least\r\nfavourable kind.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole affair the girl had shown but slight signs of the\r\nterrible affright that, under the circumstances, might have been\r\nexpected.  Born in a land and brought up among a people where human life\r\nwas lightly and precariously held, she had been often accustomed to the\r\nspectacle of death,--which to some extent robs it of its terrors.  At\r\nall events, they who are thus used appear to meet it with a more stoical\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to suppose that the girl appeared indifferent.\r\nNothing of the sort.  She exhibited apprehension,--fear sufficient; but\r\nwhether her mind was overwhelmed by the extreme peril of the situation,\r\nor that she was still ignorant of its being extreme, certain it is that\r\nher behaviour, from beginning to end, was characterised by a calmness\r\nthat seemed supernatural, or at all events superhuman.  Perhaps she was\r\nsustained by the confidence she had in the brace of brave protectors\r\nswimming alongside of her,--both of whom, even in that extreme hour,\r\ncarefully refrained from communicating to her the belief which they\r\nthemselves in all fulness entertained,--that their lives were fast\r\napproaching to a termination.\r\n\r\nThe minds of both were fully imbued with this conviction, though not in\r\nthe same degree of fulness.  If possible, the white man felt more\r\ncertain of the proximity of his end than did the negro.  It is not easy\r\nto tell why it was so.  The reason may, perhaps, be found in the fact,\r\nthat the latter had been so often on the edge of the other world, had so\r\noften escaped entering it, that, despite the impossibility of escaping\r\nfrom his present peril,--to all appearance absolute,--there still\r\nlingered in his breast some remnant of hopefulness.\r\n\r\nNot so with the sailor.  From the bosom of Ben Brace every vestige of\r\nhope had vanished.  He looked upon life as no longer possible.  Once or\r\ntwice the thought had actually entered his mind to put an end to the\r\nstruggle, and, along with it, the agony of that terrible hour, by\r\nsuspending the action of his arms, and suffering himself to sink to the\r\nbottom of the sea.  He was only restrained from the suicidal act, by the\r\ninfluence of that instinct of our nature, which abhors self-destruction,\r\nand admonishes, or rather compels us, to abide the final moment when\r\ndeath comes to claim us as its own.\r\n\r\nThus, by different circumstances, and under different influences, were\r\nthe three castaways of the _Catamaran_ sustained upon the surface of the\r\nwater,--Lilly Lalee by Snowball,--Snowball, by the slightest ray of hope\r\nstill lingering in a corner of his black bosom,--the sailor by an\r\ninstinct causing him to refrain from the committal of that act which, in\r\ncivilised society, under all circumstances, is considered as a crime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nA CHEST AT SEA.\r\n\r\nAll conversation had come to an end.  Even the few phrases at intervals\r\nexchanged between Snowball and the sailor,--the solemn import of which\r\nhad been zealously kept from the child by their being spoken in\r\n_French_--were no longer heard.\r\n\r\nThe swimmers, now wellnigh exhausted, had for a long interval preserved\r\nthis profound silence, partly for the reason of their being exhausted,\r\nand partly that no change had occurred in the circumstances surrounding\r\nthem,--nothing that required a renewal of the conversation.  The awe of\r\napproaching death,--now so near, that twenty minutes or a quarter of an\r\nhour might be regarded as the ultimate moment,--held, as if spellbound,\r\nthe speech both of Snowball and the sailor.\r\n\r\nThere were no other sounds to interrupt the silence of that solemn\r\nmoment,--at least none worthy of being mentioned.  The slightest ripple\r\nof the water, stirred by a zephyr breeze, as it played against the\r\nbodies of the languid swimmers, might have been heard, but was not\r\nheeded.  No more did the scream of the sea-mew arrest the attention of\r\nany of them, or if it did, it was only to add to the awe which reigned\r\nabove and around them.\r\n\r\nIn this moment of deep silence and deepest misery, a voice fell upon the\r\nears of the two swimmers that startled both of them, as if it had been a\r\nsummons from the other world.  It sounded sweet as if from the world of\r\neternal joy.  There was no mystery in the voice; it was that of the\r\nLilly Lalee.\r\n\r\nThe child, sustained upon the shoulder of the buoyant black, was in such\r\na position that her eyes were elevated over the surface of the water\r\nseveral inches above those either of him who supported her, or the\r\nsailor who swam by her side.  In this situation she had a better view\r\nthan either; and, as a consequence of this advantage, she saw what was\r\nvisible to neither,--a dark object floating upon the surface of the sea\r\nat no great distance from the spot where the exhausted swimmers were\r\nfeebly struggling to sustain themselves.\r\n\r\nIt was the announcement of this fact that had fallen with such startling\r\neffect upon the ears of the two men, simultaneously rousing both from\r\nthat torpor of despair which for some time had held possession of them.\r\n\r\n\"Who you see, Lilly Lally?  Who you see?\" exclaimed Snowball, who was\r\nthe first to interrogate the girl.  \"Look at 'im 'gain,--look, good\r\nlilly gal!\" continued he, at the same time making an effort to elevate\r\nthe shoulder which gave support to his _protege_.\r\n\r\n\"Wha be it?  I ain't de raff,--de _Catamaran_?  Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" replied the child.  \"It isn't that.  It's a small thing of a\r\nsquare shape.  It looks like a box.\"\r\n\r\n\"A box? how come dat?  A box! what de debbel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shiver my timbers if 'tain't my old sea-kit,\" interrupted the sailor,\r\nrearing himself aloft in the water like a spaniel in search of wounded\r\nwaterfowl.\r\n\r\n\"Sure as my name's Ben Brace it be that, an' nothing else!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your sea-chess?\" interrogated Snowball, elevating his woolly cranium\r\nabove the water, so as also to command a view.  \"Golly!  I b'lieve it\r\nam.  How he come dar?  You leff 'im on de raff?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" replied the sailor.  \"The very last thing I had my hands upon,\r\nafore I jumped overboard.  Sure I bean't mistaken,--ne'er a bit o' it.\r\nIt be the old kit to a sartainty.\"\r\n\r\nThis conversation was carried on in a quick, hurried tone, and long\r\nbefore it ended,--in fact at the moment of its beginning,--the swimmers\r\nhad once more put themselves in motion, and were striking out in the\r\ndirection of the object thus unexpectedly presented to their view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nAN IMPROVISED LIFE-PRESERVER.\r\n\r\nWhether it should turn out to be the sea-chest of Ben Brace or no, it\r\nappeared to be a chest of some sort; and, being of wood, buoyantly\r\nfloating on the water, it promised to help in supporting the swimmers,--\r\nnow so utterly exhausted as to be on the point of giving up, and going\r\nto the bottom.\r\n\r\nIf the sailor had entertained any doubts as to the character of the\r\nobject upon which they were advancing, they were soon brought to an end.\r\nIt _was_ a sea-chest,--his own,--to him easy of identification.  Well\r\nknew he that close-fitting canvas cover, which he had himself made for\r\nit, rendered waterproof by a coat of blue paint,--well knew he those\r\nhanging handles of strong sennit, he had himself plaited and attached to\r\nit; and, as if to provide against any possible dispute about the\r\nownership of the chest, were the letters \"B.B.,\"--the unmistakable\r\ninitials of Ben Brace,--painted conspicuously upon its side, just under\r\nthe keyhole, with a \"fouled anchor\" beneath, with stars and other\r\nfantastic emblems scattered around,--all testifying to the artistic\r\nskill of the owner of the kit.\r\n\r\nThe first thought of the sailor, on recognising his chest, was that some\r\nmisfortune had happened to the raft, and that it had gone to pieces.\r\n\r\n\"Poor little Will'm!\" said he.  \"If that be so, then it be all over wi'\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nThis belief was but of short duration, and was followed by a reflection\r\nof a more pleasant kind.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he exclaimed, contradicting his first hypothesis, \"It can't be\r\nthat.  What could 'a broke up the raft?  There 's been no wind, nor\r\nrough weather, as could 'a done it.  Ha!  I have it, Snowy.  It's Will'm\r\n's did this.  He's throwed over the chest in the behopes it might help\r\nfloat us.  That's how it's got here.  Huzza for that brave boy!  Let's\r\ncling on to the kit.  There may be hope for us yet.\"\r\n\r\nThis suggestion was superfluous: for the idea of clinging to the kit was\r\nintuitive, and had entered the minds of both swimmers on their first\r\nperceiving it.  It was with that view they had simultaneously set\r\nthemselves in motion, and commenced swimming towards it.\r\n\r\nThe chest certainly offered an attractive object to men circumstanced as\r\nthey were at that moment,--something more than a straw to be clutched\r\nat.  It was floating bottom downwards, and lid upwards,--just as it\r\nmight have been placed opposite Ben's own bunk in the forecastle of a\r\nfrigate,--and it appeared to be kept steadily balanced in this position\r\nby the weight of some iron cleeting along the bottom, which acted as\r\nballast.  Otherwise the chest sat so high upon the water, as to show\r\nthat it must either be quite empty or nearly so; for the sennit handles\r\nat each end, which were several inches below the level of the lid, hung\r\nquite clear above the surface.\r\n\r\nThese handles offered the most salient points to seize upon; so\r\ntempting, too, that it was not necessary for the sailor to suggest that\r\nSnowball should lay hold of one, while he himself sought the support of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement appeared to offer itself tacitly to the Instinct of\r\neach; and, on arriving near the chest, they swam to opposite ends,--and\r\neach laid hold of a handle, as soon as he came within the proper\r\ndistance to grasp it.\r\n\r\nThis kept the chest properly balanced; and although the weight they\r\nadded to it caused it to sink several inches in the water, to their\r\ngreat joy its top still stood well above the surface.  Even when the\r\nlight form of Lilly Lalee lay resting along the lid, there were still\r\nseveral inches between the water line and its upper edge,--the only\r\nplace where sea-water could possibly find admission into the kit of the\r\nEnglish sailor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nCONJECTURES ABOUT THE CATAMARAN.\r\n\r\nIn less than three minutes after coming in contact with the kit, the\r\nthree castaways formed a group, curious and peculiar.  On the right of\r\nthe chest was the sailor, his body stretched transversely along its end,\r\nwith his left arm buried to the elbow in the sennit loop forming its\r\nhandle.  Half of his weight being thus supported by the buoyant box, it\r\nwas only necessary for him to keep his right arm in regular motion to\r\nsustain himself above the surface.  This, even wearied as he was, he was\r\nenabled to accomplish without difficulty: for the new position was one\r\nrather of rest than of labour.\r\n\r\nAt the opposite end of the chest, in a _pose_ precisely similar, the\r\nsea-cook had placed himself,--the only difference being in the uses\r\nrespectively made of their arms.  Snowball's right arm was the one\r\nthrust through the handle, his left being left free for swimming.\r\n\r\nAs already hinted, Lilly Lalee had been transferred from Snowball's\r\nshoulder to a more elevated position,--upon the top of the chest where,\r\nlying upon her breast, and grasping the projecting edge of the lid, she\r\nwas enabled to keep her place without any exertion.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to say that this change in the situation and\r\ncircumstances of the party had also produced a change in their\r\nprospects.  It is true that death might have appeared as inevitable as\r\never.  They were still at its door,--though not quite so near entering\r\nas they had been but a few minutes before.  With the help of the\r\ncapacious chest--forming, as it did, a famous life-preserver--they might\r\nnow sustain themselves for many hours above the surface,--in fact, as\r\nlong as hunger and thirst would allow them.  Their holding out would be\r\nsimply a question of strength; and had they been only assured of a\r\nsupply of food and drink, they might have looked forward to a long\r\nvoyage performed in this singular fashion: that is, provided the sea\r\naround them should keep clear of storms and sharks.\r\n\r\nAlas! the approach of one or the other of these perils was a contingency\r\nto be looked for at any moment, and to be dreaded accordingly.\r\n\r\nJust at that moment they were not thinking of either, nor even of the\r\nprobability of perishing by hunger or its kindred appetite,--thirst.\r\nThe singular coincidence that the chest should come floating that way,\r\njust when they were on the point of perishing, had produced a remarkable\r\neffect on the minds both of the sailor and the sea-cook, begetting not\r\npositive conviction, but a pleasant presentiment that there might be\r\nother and more permanent succour in store for them; and that, after all,\r\nthey were not destined to die by drowning,--at least not just then\r\nHope,--sweet, soothing hope!--had again sprung up in the bosom of both;\r\nand, along with it the determination to make a further effort for the\r\nsaving of their lives.  They could now exchange both speech and counsel\r\nwith perfect freedom; and they proceeded to discuss the situation.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the chest required explanation.  The theory, which at\r\nfirst sight of it had suggested itself to its owner (that the raft had\r\ngone to pieces and that the kit was one of the scattered fragments) was\r\nnot tenable, nor was it entertained for a moment.  There had been no\r\nconvulsion, either of winds or waves, to destroy the _Catamaran_; and\r\nthis curiously-fashioned fabric, in all its fantastic outlines, must\r\nstill be intact and afloat somewhere upon the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt is true they could see nothing of it anywhere; neither could Lilly\r\nLalee, who, from her more elevated position, was instructed to survey\r\nthe circle of the horizon,--a duty which the child performed with the\r\ngreatest care.\r\n\r\nIf the craft had been anywhere within the distance of a league or two,\r\nthe large lateen sail should have been sufficiently conspicuous to have\r\ncaught the eye of the girl.  But she saw it not.  She saw nothing,--so\r\nran her report,--but the sea and sky.\r\n\r\nFrom this it might have been inferred (even supposing the _Catamaran_ to\r\nbe still afloat) that it must have drifted to such a distance as to have\r\ndestroyed all chance of their ever overtaking it.  But the sage seaman\r\ndid not give way to this form of reasoning.  His conjectures were of a\r\nmore consolatory character,--founded upon certain data which had\r\npresented themselves to his mind.  On reflection, he came to the\r\nconclusion that the presence of the sea-chest upon the bosom of the blue\r\nwater was no accidental circumstance, but a design,--the design of\r\nlittle William.\r\n\r\n\"I be sure o't, Snowy,\" said he; \"the lad ha' chucked the kit overboard,\r\nknowin' as how we mout overhaul it, when we could not come up wi' the\r\n_Catamaran_.  The chest war amidships, when I parted from it.  It\r\ncouldn't a' got into the water o' itself no-howsomever; besides, it war\r\nfull o' heavy things, and now I'm sartin it be empty,--else how do it\r\nfloat so?  Sure he must a' whammelled it upside down, and spilled out\r\nthe things afore he pitched it overboard.  It was thoughtful o' him; but\r\nhe be just the one for that.  I've seed him do some'at similar afore.\r\nOnly think o' the dear boy!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Ben, after this burst of enthusiasm, for a moment indulged his\r\nadmiration in silence.\r\n\r\n\"Dat's all berry likely,--berry likely,\" was the rejoinder of the\r\nCoromantee.\r\n\r\n\"I know what he did next,\" said Ben, continuing the thread of his\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\n\"Wha' you tink, Massa Brace?\"\r\n\r\n\"He tuk in sail.  I don't know why he didn't do it sooner; for I called\r\nto him to do that, an' he must ha' heerd me.  I've jest got a idea that\r\nthe fault was not his'n.  When I hauled up that bit o' canvas, I've a\r\nsort o' recollection o' puttin' a ugly knot on the haulyards.  Maybe he\r\nwarn't able, wi' his little bits o' digits, to get the snarl clear, as\r\nfast as mout a' been wished; an' that'll explain the whole thing.\r\nSartin he got down the sail at last,--eyther by loosin' the belay, or\r\ncuttin' the piece o' rope, and that's why there be no canvas in sight.\r\nFor all that, the _Catamaran_ can't be so fur off.  She hadn't had time\r\nto a' drifted to such a great distance,--'specially if the sail were got\r\ndown the time as we missed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat am true.  I miss de sail all ob a sudden,--jess as if it had come\r\ndown, yard an' all, straight slap bang.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Snowy,\" continued the sailor, in a tone of increased\r\ncheerfulness, \"if't be as we conjecture, the craft ain't far ahead o' us\r\nyet.  Maybe only a knot or two; for one can't see far over the water who\r\nhappens to be neck-deep under it as we be.  In any case she be sure to\r\nbe lying to leuart o' us; and, without the sail, she won't drift faster\r\nthan we can swim, nor yet so fast.  Let us do the best we can to make a\r\nmile or two's leeway; an' then we'll know whether the old Cat's still\r\ncrawling about, or whether she's gin us the slip altogether.  That's the\r\nbest thing we can do,--ain't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"De berry bess, Massa Brace.  We can't do nuffin' better dan swim down\r\nde wind.\"\r\n\r\nWithout further parley, the two set themselves to the task thus\r\nproposed; and one striking with his right hand, the other with his\r\nleft,--both buffeting the waves with equal vigour and resolution,--they\r\nwere soon sweeping onward with a velocity that caused the sea to surge\r\nalong the sides of the chest, until the froth rose to the fingers of\r\nLilly Lalee as she lay grasping its lid!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\r\n\r\nDOWN THE WIND.\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded very far, when a cry from the girl caused them to\r\nsuspend their exertions.  While the others were occupied in propelling\r\nthe chest, Lalee, kneeling upon the lid, had been keeping a lookout\r\nahead.  Something she saw had elicited that cry, which was uttered in a\r\ntone that betokened, if not joy, at least some sort of gratification.\r\n\r\n\"Wha is it, Lilly Lally?\" interrogated the black, with an air of\r\neagerness; \"you see someting.  Golly! am it de _Cat'maran_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--it is not that.  It's only a barrel floating on the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only a ba'l,--what sort o' a ba'l you tink 'im?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it's one of the empty water-casks we had tied to the raft.  I'm\r\nsure it is: for I see ropes upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" echoed Ben, who, having poised himself aloft, had also caught\r\nsight of the cask.  \"Shiver my timbers! it do look like as if the Cat\r\nhad come to pieces.  But no!  Tain't that has set the cask adrift.  I\r\nset it all now.  Little Will'm be at the bottom o' this too.  He has cut\r\naway the lashin's o' the barrel, so as to gie us one more chance, in the\r\ncase o' our not comin' across the chest.  How thoughtful o' the lad!\r\nJust like 'im, as I said it war!\"\r\n\r\n\"We bess swim for de cask an' take 'im in tow,\" suggested the sea-cook;\r\n\"no harm hab 'im 'longside too.  If de wind 'pring up, de ole chess be\r\nno use much.  De cask de berry ting den.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Snowy! we musn't leave the cask behind us.  If the kit\r\nhave served us a good turn, the other 'ud be safer in a rough sea.  It\r\nbe dead ahead, so we may keep straight on.\"\r\n\r\nIn five minutes after, they were alongside the cask,--easily recognised\r\nby its rope lashings, as one of those they had left attached to the\r\nraft.  The sailor at the first glance saw that some of the chords\r\nencircling it had been cut with a knife, or other sharp instrument,--not\r\nsevered with any degree of exactitude, but \"haggled,\" as if the act had\r\nbeen hurriedly performed.\r\n\r\n\"Little Will'm again!  He's cut the ropes wi' the old axe, an' it were\r\nblunt enough to make a job for him!  Huzza for the noble lad!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tay!\" cried Snowball, not heeding the enthusiastic outburst of the\r\nsailor.  \"You hold on to de chess, Massa Brace, while I climb up on de\r\ncask, and see what I can see.  May be I may see de _Catamaran_ herseff\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, nigger.  You had better do that.  Mount the barrel, an' I'll\r\nkeep a tight hold o' the kit.\"\r\n\r\nSnowball, releasing his arm from the sennit loop, swam up to the\r\nfloating cask; and, after some dodging about, succeeded in getting\r\nastride of it.\r\n\r\nIt required a good deal of dexterous manoeuvring to keep the cask from\r\nrolling, and pitching him back into the water.  But Snowball was just\r\nthe man to excel in this sort of aquatic gymnastics; and after a time he\r\nbecame balanced in his seat with sufficient steadiness to admit of his\r\ntaking a fair survey of the ocean around him.\r\n\r\nThe sailor had watched his movements with a sage yet hopeful eye: for\r\nthese repeated indications of both the presence and providence of his\r\nown _protege_ had almost convinced him that the latter would not be very\r\ndistant from the spot.  It was nothing more than he had prepared himself\r\nto expect, when the Coromantee, almost as soon as he had steadied\r\nhimself astride of the water-cask, shouted, in a loud voice--\r\n\r\n\"The _Cat'maran_!--the _Cat'maran_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" cried the sailor.  \"To leuart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead in dat same direcshun.\"\r\n\r\n\"How fur, cookey? how fur?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so fur as you might hear de bos'n's whissel; not more dan tree,\r\nfour length ob a man-o'-war cable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, Snowy!  What do you think best to be done?\"\r\n\r\n\"De bess ting we can do now,\" replied the negro, \"am for me to obertake\r\ndat ere craff.  As you said, de sail am down; an' de ole Cat no go\r\nfasser dan a log o' 'hogany wood in a calm o' de tropic.  If dis child\r\nswim affer, he soon come up; and den wif de oar an' de help ob lilly\r\nWilly, he meet you more dan half-way,--dat fo' sartin.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think you can overtake her, Snowball?\"\r\n\r\n\"I be sartin ob dat ere.  You tay here wif Lilly Lally.  Keep by de\r\nchess and de cask boaf,--for de latter am better dan de former.  No\r\nfear, I soon bring de _Cat'maran_ long dis way, once I get 'board o'\r\nher.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the negro gave the cask a \"cant\" to one side, slipped off\r\ninto the water; and, with a final caution to his comrade to keep close\r\nto the spot where they were parting, he stretched out his muscular arms\r\nto their full extent, and commenced surging through the water,--snorting\r\nas he went like some huge cetacean of the tribe of the _Mysticeti_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY.\r\n\r\nLAUNCHING THE LIFE-PRESERVER.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce necessary to say that, during all this time.  Little\r\nWilliam, on board the _Catamaran_, was half wild with anxious thoughts.\r\nHe had obeyed the first instructions shouted to him by Ben Brace, and\r\ntaken to the steering-oar; but, after struggling for some time to get\r\nthe craft round, and seeing that his efforts were of no avail, he\r\ndropped it to comply with the still later orders given by the sailor: to\r\nlet loose the halliards and lower the sail.  Ben had wondered, and with\r\na slight feeling of chagrin, why this last order had not been\r\nexecuted,--at least more promptly,--for at a later period he knew the\r\nsail had been lowered; but Ben was of course ignorant of the cause of\r\nthe delay.\r\n\r\nHis conjecture, however, afterwards expressed, when he half-remembered\r\nhaving put \"a ugly knot on the haulyards\"; which he, little William,\r\n\"maybe warn't able to get clear as fast as mout a been wished,\" was\r\nperfectly correct; as was also the additional hypothesis that the sail\r\nhad been got down at last, \"either by loosin' the belay or cuttin' the\r\npiece o' rope.\"\r\n\r\nThe latter was in reality the mode by which the sailor-lad had succeeded\r\nin lowering the sail.\r\n\r\nAs Ben had conjectured, the belaying loop had proved too much for the\r\nstrength of William's fingers; and, after several fruitless efforts to\r\nuntie the knot, he had at length given it up, and, seizing the axe, had\r\nsevered the halliard by cutting it through and through.\r\n\r\nOf course the sail came down upon the instant; but it was then too late;\r\nand when William again looked out over the ocean, he saw only the ocean\r\nitself, with neither spot nor speck to break the uniformity of its\r\nboundless bosom of blue.\r\n\r\nIn that glance he perceived that he was alone,--he felt for the first\r\ntime that he was alone upon the ocean!\r\n\r\nThe thought was sufficient to beget despair,--to paralyse him against\r\nall further action; and, had he been a boy of the ordinary stamp, such\r\nmight have been the result.  But he was not one of this kind.  The\r\nspirit which had first impelled him to seek adventure by sea, proved a\r\nmind moulded for enterprise and action.  It was not the sort of spirit\r\nto yield easily to despair; nor did it then.\r\n\r\nInstead of resigning himself up to fate or chance, he continued to exert\r\nthe powers both of his mind and body, in the hope that something might\r\nstill be done to retrieve the misfortune which had befallen the crew of\r\nthe _Catamaran_.  He again returned to the steering-oar; and, hastily\r\ndetaching it from the hook upon which it had been mounted as a rudder,\r\nhe commenced using it as a paddle, and endeavoured to propel the raft\r\nagainst the wind.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce necessary to say that he employed all his strength in the\r\neffort; but, notwithstanding this, he soon became convinced that he was\r\nemploying it in vain.  The huge _Catamaran_ lay just as Snowball had\r\ncharacteristically described her,--\"like a log o' 'hogany wood in a calm\r\nob de tropic.\"\r\n\r\nEven worse than this; for, paddle as he would, the sailor-lad soon\r\nperceived that the raft, instead of making way against the wind, or even\r\nholding its ground, still continued to drift rapidly to leeward.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis another idea occurred to him.  It might have occurred\r\nsooner, had his mind not been monopolised with the hope of being able to\r\nrow the raft to windward.  Failing in this, however, his next idea was\r\nto throw something overboard,--something that might afford a support to\r\nthe swimmers struggling in the water.\r\n\r\nThe first object that came under his eyes promising such rapport was the\r\nsea-kit of the sailor.  As already stated, it was amidships,--where its\r\nowner had been exploring it.  The lid was open, and little William\r\nperceived that it was wellnigh empty; since its contents could be seen\r\nscattered on all sides, just as the sailor had rummaged them out,\r\nforming a _paraphernalia_ of sufficient variety and extent to have\r\nfurnished the forecastle of a frigate.\r\n\r\nThe sight of the chest, with its painted canvas covering, which Little\r\nWilliam knew to be water-tight, was suggestive.  With the lid locked\r\ndown, it might act as a buoy, and serve for a life-preserver.  At all\r\nevents, no better appeared to offer itself; and, without further\r\nhesitation, the lad slammed down the lid, which fortunately had the\r\ntrick of locking itself with a spring, and, seizing the chest by one of\r\nthe sennit handles, he dragged it to the edge of the raft, gave it a\r\nfinal push, and launched it overboard into the blue water of the ocean.\r\n\r\nLittle William was pleased to see that the kit, even while in the water,\r\nmaintained its proper position,--that is, it swam bottom downwards.  It\r\nfloated buoyantly, moreover, as if it had been made of cork.  He was\r\nprepared for this; for he remembered having listened to a conversation\r\nin the forecastle of the _Pandora_, relating to this very chest, in\r\nwhich Ben Brace had taken the principal part, and in which the sea-going\r\nqualities of his kit had been freely and proudly commented upon.\r\nWilliam remembered how the _ci-devant_ man-o'-war's-man had boasted of\r\nhis _craft_, as he called the kit, proclaiming it \"a reg'lar life-buoy\r\nin case o' bein' cast away at sea,\" and declaring that, \"if 't war\r\nemp'y,--as he hoped it never should be,--it would float the whole crew\r\no' a pinnace or longboat.\"\r\n\r\nIt was partly through this reminiscence that the idea of launching the\r\nchest had occurred to little William; and, as he saw it receding from\r\nthe stern of the _Catamaran_, he had some happiness in the hope, that\r\nthe confidence of his companion and protector might not be misplaced;\r\nbut that the vaunted kit might prove the preserver, not only of _his_\r\nlife, but of the life of one who to little William was now _even_ dearer\r\nthan Ben Brace.  That one was Lilly Lalee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY ONE.\r\n\r\nA LOOKOUT FROM ALOFT.\r\n\r\nAfter launching the kit, little William did not think of surrendering\r\nhimself to inaction.  He bethought him that something more should be\r\ndone,--that some other _waifs_ should be turned adrift from the\r\n_Catamaran_, which, by getting into the way of the swimmers, might offer\r\nthem an additional chance of support.\r\n\r\nWhat next?  A plank?  No; a cask,--one of the empty water-casks?  That\r\nwould be the thing,--the thing itself.\r\n\r\nNo sooner thought of than one was detached.  The lashings were cut with\r\nthe axe, in default of his finding a knife; and the cask, like the kit,\r\nsoon fell into the wake.  Not very rapidly it was true; for the\r\n_Catamaran_ now, deprived of her sail, did not drift so fast to leeward\r\nas formerly.  Still she went faster than either the kit or the cask,\r\nhowever; on account of the breeze acting upon her stout mast and some\r\nother objects that stood high upon her deck; and William very reasonably\r\nsupposed that to swimmers so much exhausted,--as by that time must be\r\nboth Ben and Snowball,--even the difference of a cable's length might be\r\nof vital importance.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to him also, that the greater the number of waifs sent in\r\ntheir way, the better would be their chance of seeing and getting hold\r\nof one of them.  Instead of desisting therefore, as soon as he had\r\ndetached the first cask, he commenced cutting loose a second, and\r\ncommitting it to the sea in like manner.\r\n\r\nHaving freed a second, he continued on to a third, and then a fourth,\r\nand was actually about to sever the lashings of a fifth one, with the\r\nintention to leave only the sixth one--that which contained the stock of\r\nprecious water--attached to the _Catamaran_.  He knew that the raft\r\nwould still float, without any of the casks to buoy it up; and it was\r\nnot any fear on that score that caused him to desist, when about to give\r\nthe cut to the cords that confined cask Number 5.  It was an observation\r\nwhich he had made of an entirely different nature; and this was, that\r\nthe third cask when set loose, and more especially the fourth, instead\r\nof falling into the wake of the _Catamaran_, kept close by her side, as\r\nif loath to part company with a craft to which they had been so\r\nintimately attached.\r\n\r\nWilliam wondered at this, but only for a short moment.  He was not slow\r\nin comprehending the cause of the unexpected phenomenon.  The raft, no\r\nlonger buoyed up, had sunk almost to the level of the surface; and the\r\nbreeze now failed to impel it any faster than the casks themselves: so\r\nthat both casks and _Catamaran_ were making leeway at a like rate of\r\nspeed, or rather with equal slowness.\r\n\r\nThough the sailor-lad was dissatisfied on first perceiving this, after a\r\nmoment's reflection, he saw that it was a favourable circumstance.  Of\r\ncourse, it was not that the casks were making _more_ way to leeward, but\r\nthat the _Catamaran_ was making _less_; and, therefore, if there was a\r\nchance of the swimmers coming up with the former, there was an equal\r\nprobability of their overtaking the latter,--which would be better in\r\nevery way.  Indeed, the raft was now going at such a rate, that the\r\nslowest swimmer might easily overtake her, provided the distance between\r\nthem was not too great.\r\n\r\nIt was this last thought that now occupied the mind of little William,\r\nand rendered him anxious.  Had the swimmers fallen too far into the\r\nwake?  Or would they still be able to swim on to the raft?\r\n\r\nWhere were they at that moment?  He looked aft, towards the point from\r\nwhich he supposed himself to have been drifting.  He was not sure of the\r\ndirection; for the rude construction on which he stood had kept\r\nconstantly whirling in the water,--now the stem, now the quarters, anon\r\nthe bows, or beam-ends turned towards the breeze.  He looked, but saw\r\nnothing.  Only the sea-kit that by this time had got several hundred\r\nfathoms to windward, cask Number 1 a little nearer, and Number 2 still\r\nnearer.  These, however, strung out in a line, enabled him to conjecture\r\nthe direction in which the swimmers, if still above water, should be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was something more definite than a conjecture.  Rather was it\r\na certainty.  He knew that the raft could not have made way otherwise\r\nthan _down the wind_; and that those who belonged to it could not be\r\nelsewhere than to windward.\r\n\r\nGuided, therefore, by the breeze, he gazed in this direction,--sweeping\r\nwith his eye an arc of the horizon sufficiently large to allow for any\r\ndeviation which the swimmers might have made from the true track.\r\n\r\nHe gazed in vain.  The kit, the casks, a gull or two, soaring on snowy\r\nwings, were all the objects that broke the monotony of the blue water to\r\nwindward.\r\n\r\nHe glided across the low-lying planks of the raft, and up to the empty\r\ncask still attached, which offered the highest point for observation.\r\nHe balanced himself on its top, and once more scanned the sea to\r\nwindward.\r\n\r\nNothing in sight, save kit, casks, and gulls lazily plying their long\r\nscimitar-shaped wings with easy unconcern, as if the limitless ocean\r\nwas,--what in reality it was,--their habitat and home.\r\n\r\nSuffering the torture of disappointment,--each moment increasing in\r\nagony,--little William leaped down from the cask; and, rushing\r\namidships, commenced mounting the mast.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds he had swarmed to its top: and, there clinging, once\r\nmore directed his glance over the water.  He gazed long without\r\ndiscovering any trace of his missing companions,--so long that his\r\nsinews were tried to the utmost; and the muscles both of his arms and\r\nlimbs becoming relaxed, he was compelled to let go, and slide down\r\ndespairingly upon the planks forming the deck of the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nHe stayed below only long enough to recover strength; and then a second\r\ntime went swarming up the stick.  If kit and casks should serve no\r\nbetter purpose, they at least guided him as to the direction; and\r\nlooking over both, he scanned the sea beyond.\r\n\r\nThe gulls guided him still better; for both--there was a brace of them--\r\nhad now descended near to the surface of the sea; and, wheeling in short\r\nflights, seemed to occupy themselves with some object in the water\r\nbelow.  Though they were at a great distance off, he could hear an\r\noccasional scream proceeding from their throats: as if the object\r\nattracting them excited either their curiosity or some passion of a more\r\nturbulent character.\r\n\r\nTheir evolutions,--constantly returning towards a centre,--guided the\r\neye of the observer until it rested on an object just visible above the\r\nsheen of the water.  The colour of this object rendered it the more easy\r\nof being distinguished amidst the blue water that surrounded it; for it\r\nwas blacker than anything which the sea produces,--unless it were the\r\nbone of the giant _Mysticetus_.  Its shape, too--almost a perfect\r\nsphere--had something to do in its identification: for William was able\r\nto identify it, and by a process of negative reasoning.  It was not the\r\nblack albatross, the frigate-bird, nor the booby.  Though of like\r\ncolour, there was no bird of such form as that.  There was neither beast\r\nnor fish belonging to the sea that could show such a shape above its\r\nsurface.  That sable globe, rounded like a sea-hedgehog, or a\r\nTurk's-head clew, and black as a tarred tackle-block, could be nothing\r\nelse than the woolly pate of Snowball, the sea-cook!\r\n\r\nA little beyond were two other objects of dark colour and founded shape;\r\nbut neither so dark nor so round as that already identified.  They must\r\nbe the heads of the English sailor and Lilly Lalee.  They appeared to be\r\nequally objects of attraction to the gulls, that alternately flew from\r\none to the other, or kept hovering above them,--and continuously\r\nuttering their shrill, wild screams,--now more distinctly heard by\r\nlittle William, clinging high up on the mast of the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY TWO.\r\n\r\nONCE MORE ABOARD.\r\n\r\nThe sailor-lad did not remain longer on the top of the mast than just to\r\nsatisfy himself that what he saw were his companions, still afloat and\r\nalive.  They were not at such a distance neither as to render it\r\naltogether impossible for them to recover their lost way; and,\r\nstimulated by this hope, little William determined upon continuing his\r\nefforts to assist them.\r\n\r\nGliding back upon the planks of the raft, he laid hold of the detached\r\noar; and once more plying it as a paddle, he endeavoured to propel the\r\n_Catamaran_ up the wind.\r\n\r\nIt is true he made but slight progress in this direction but he had the\r\nsatisfaction of knowing that the craft held her ground, and something\r\nmore; as he could tell from the fact of the casks last set loose by him,\r\nfalling a little to leeward.  This showed that he must himself be making\r\nway to the windward.\r\n\r\nThe sea-chest and the cask first loosed from its lashings, had been\r\nlaunched long before any of the others,--for it was only after an\r\ninterval of reflection that he had set free the rest,--and the former\r\nwere now far to windward.  When looking from the masthead he had noted\r\nthat the position of the swimmers was not so far beyond the kit; and it\r\nwas scarce possible at that time, that they could have failed to\r\ndiscover it.  Without staying to consider whether they had done so or\r\nnot, William had come down from his perch; and now that he had reapplied\r\nhimself to the oar, and saw that he was gaining ground in the right\r\ndirection, he did not like to desist.  Every fathom he made to windward\r\nwas a fathom nearer to the saving of the lives of his companions,--a\r\nstroke less for the swimmers to make,--to whom, wearied as they must now\r\nbe, the saving of even a single stroke might be an object.\r\n\r\nWith this thought urging him to perseverance, the sailor-lad stuck to\r\nhis oar, wielding it with all the strength in his arms, and only\r\nthinking of the one purpose,--to make way against the wind.  Fortunately\r\nthe breeze, already gentle, seemed each moment to grow gentler,--as if\r\nunwilling to oppose his efforts in the cause of humanity; and little\r\nWilliam perceived, to his great gratification, that the casks already\r\npassed by the _Catamaran_ were falling far into her wake.  This proved\r\nthat he must be gaining upon the others.\r\n\r\nAll at once a glad sight came suddenly under his eyes.  Earnestly\r\noccupied with the oar, he had permitted more than a minute to elapse\r\nwithout casting a glance ahead.  When at length he renewed his lookout\r\nto windward, he was surprised to see, not only the cask and the\r\nsea-chest still nearer but on the top of the latter, a something that\r\nwas not there before.  Something that lay along the lid, with arms\r\nstretched downwards, and hands clutching its projecting edges.  He also\r\nperceived two dark rounded objects in the water,--one near each end of\r\nthe chest,--one rounder and blacker than the other, but both easily\r\ndistinguishable as the heads of human beings.\r\n\r\nThe singular tableau was at once understood.  Lilly Lalee was on the top\r\nof the sea-kit; Snowball and Ben Brace were flanking it, one at each\r\nend.  The chest was supporting all three.  Hurrah! they were saved!\r\n\r\nLittle William, at that moment, felt certain they would be saved; though\r\nthat joyful certainty had not yet been communicated to them.  Standing\r\nerect upon an elevated part of the raft, the boy had the advantage of\r\nthem, and could note every movement they were making, without being seen\r\nby them.\r\n\r\nHe did not spend much time in merely looking at them.  He knew that that\r\nwould be of no avail; and after giving utterance to one or two joyous\r\nejaculations, he returned to the oar, if possible plying it with greater\r\nenergy than ever, from the renewed encouragement which he now derived\r\nfrom the confidence of success.\r\n\r\nWhen he turned again and stood upright, looking to windward, the tableau\r\nhad changed.  Lilly Lalee was still lying along the lid of the chest,\r\nbut only one head was seen in the water!  It was that of the sailor, as\r\nthe white face and the long flowing hair told him.\r\n\r\nWhere was the cranium of the sea-cook?  Where was the skull of Snowball?\r\nGone with his body to the bottom?\r\n\r\nThese interrogatories flashed across the brain of the lad, causing him a\r\nfeeling of alarm.  It was of short continuance, however.  In the next\r\nmoment they were answered, and to his satisfaction.  The Coromantee was\r\nseen astride of the cask, more conspicuous than ever: only, being now in\r\na slightly different direction, he had not been seen at the first\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nWithout shouting, or making any other idle demonstration, the\r\nintelligent youth once more applied himself to the oars, and vigorously\r\npropelled the raft to windward.\r\n\r\nHe did not again desist, until a voice falling upon his ear and,\r\npronouncing his name, caused him to look once more in the direction of\r\nthe swimmers.\r\n\r\nThen, instead of seeing the Coromantee astride of the cask, he perceived\r\nthe round black physiognomy of that individual above the surface of the\r\nwater, and scarce a cable's length from the _Catamaran_!\r\n\r\nA double line of frothy ripple proceeding from each of his large spread\r\nears, and running rapidly into his wake, indicated the direction in\r\nwhich he was swimming,--towards the raft,--while his eyeballs showing\r\nfearfully, and white as the froth itself,--the spluttering and blowing\r\nthat proceeded from his thick lips, and the agitation of the sea around\r\nhim,--all told that he was doing his very best to come up with the\r\n_Catamaran_.\r\n\r\n\"Golly!\" he gasped out, on perceiving himself within safe distance of\r\nbeing heard.  \"Row dis way, lilly Willy!  Row like de debbil, good lad!\r\nI'se most done up,--dat I be.  In de space ob anoder cable length dis\r\nchile he muss a gub up!\"\r\n\r\nAnd ending his speech with a loud \"Whugh,\" partly to clear the water\r\nfrom his throat, and partly to express the satisfaction he felt at the\r\nnear prospect of deliverance, he continued to strike on towards the\r\nraft.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds more the long-protracted struggle was brought to a\r\ntermination.  Snowball succeeded in reaching the raft, and, assisted by\r\nthe sailor-lad, clambered aboard.\r\n\r\nOnly staying to catch a little breath, the negro laid hold of the second\r\noar; and the _Catamaran_, under the double stroke, was soon brought _en\r\nrapport_ with the sea-chest; when the remainder of the crew were\r\nrestored to her decks, and delivered from a death that but a short time\r\nbefore had framed so certain as to be inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY THREE.\r\n\r\nREFITTING THE RAFT.\r\n\r\nOn once more setting foot on the deck of the _Catamaran_ the strong\r\nsailor was so thoroughly exhausted that he was unable to stand erect,\r\nand after scrambling aboard, and staggering a pace or two, he lay down\r\nalong the planks.  Lilly Lalee was taken care of by little William; who,\r\nhalf-leading, half-lifting her in his arms, tenderly placed her upon\r\nsome pieces of canvas near the foot of the mast.\r\n\r\nFor this service, so fondly yet delicately performed, the boy felt\r\nhimself amply rewarded by the glance of gratitude that shone in the eyes\r\nof the child,--even without the thanks faintly murmured by her on\r\nperceiving she was safe.\r\n\r\nSnowball, equally exhausted, dropped into a recumbent position.  All\r\nthree remained silent for a considerable length of time, and without\r\nstirring either hand or foot,--as though to speak or move in their state\r\nof extreme weariness was impossible.\r\n\r\nLittle William, however, did not resign himself to inaction.  As soon as\r\nhe had disposed of Lalee, he made direct to that corner of the\r\n_Catamaran_ where a small barrel or keg, half submerged under the water,\r\nwas attached to one of the timbers of the craft.  It was the keg\r\ncontaining the precious \"Canary.\"\r\n\r\nCarefully extracting the bung,--which, in the lashing of the keg, had\r\nbeen purposely kept upwards,--he inserted a dipper,--that is to say, a\r\nsmall tin vessel, or drinking \"taut,\"--which had turned up among the\r\nstores of the sea-kit, and which, having been already used for the same\r\npurpose, was provided with a piece of cord attached around its rim, like\r\nthe vessel in use among the gaugers or wine-merchants for drawing their\r\nwine from the wood.  This was hoisted out again, filled with the sweet\r\nfluid which the keg contained; and which was at once administered,--\r\nfirst to Lilly Lalee, then to William's own especial protector, Ben\r\nBrace; and lastly, after a fresh draw from the keg, to the real owner of\r\nthe wine,--the Coromantee.  The spirit of the grape, grown upon the\r\ndeclivities of Teneriffe, acted like magic on all three; and in a few\r\nminutes both sailor and sea-cook were sufficiently restored to think\r\nabout taking certain prudent measures, that had now become necessary,\r\nand that would require a fresh exertion of their strength.\r\n\r\nThese measures were the recovery of the empty casks which William had\r\ndetached from the _Catamaran_; and for the want of which that improvised\r\ncraft not only lay much lower in the water than when they had left her,\r\nbut was altogether a less seaworthy structure.\r\n\r\nThe sailor's chest,--for which its owner now felt increased affection,--\r\nwas the first thing secured; and next the cask upon which Snowball had\r\nbestraddled himself to get a better view.  Both were near, and easily\r\nreached by a little rowing.\r\n\r\nThe other three casks had drifted to a considerable distance to leeward,\r\nand were still continuing their course; but as all three were in sight,\r\nthe crew of the _Catamaran_ anticipated no great difficulty in\r\novertaking them.\r\n\r\nNor did any occur.  A pair of oars handled by the sailor and sea-cook,\r\nwith the sailor-boy standing up to direct the course in which they\r\nshould pull, soon brought the raft down upon the straying hogsheads; and\r\nthey were picked up one after the other, the severed ropes respliced,\r\nand all of them set back in their old positions,--so that but for the\r\nwet garments clinging around the bodies of those who had been overboard,\r\nand perhaps the pale and wearied expression upon their countenances, no\r\none could have told that anything had gone wrong on board the\r\n_Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nAs to their wet clothes, none of them cared much for that; and if there\r\nhad been any discomfort in it, it was not likely to continue long under\r\nthe hot sun then shining down upon them.  So rapidly was this part of\r\nthe damage becoming repaired that all three,--but more especially\r\nSnowball--were now surrounded by a cloud of evaporation that would soon\r\ndry every stitch of clothing they had on.\r\n\r\nThe negro,--partly from the natural heat proceeding from his own body,\r\nand partly from the strong sunbeams,--was smoking like a fresh kindled\r\npit of charcoal: so that, through the strata of steam that encompassed\r\nhis head and shoulders, it would have been impossible to tell whether he\r\nwas black or white.  In the midst of this Juno-like _nimbus_ however,\r\nthe negro continued to talk and act, helping the sailor and little\r\nWilliam, until not only were the water-casks restored to their proper\r\nplaces, but the sail was hauled up to the mast, and the _Catamaran_ once\r\nmore scudding before the breeze, as if not the slightest accident had\r\noccurred either to craft or crew.\r\n\r\nCare was taken, however, this time to make fast the halliard rope with a\r\nproper \"belay\"; and although Snowball might have deserved a caution to\r\nbe more vigilant for the future, it was not deemed necessary to\r\nadminister it, as it was thought the peril out of which they had so\r\nmiraculously escaped would prove to him a sufficient reminder.\r\n\r\nThere was but one misfortune arising out of the adventure that might\r\nhave caused the crew of the _Catamaran_ any serious regret.  This was\r\nthe loss of a large portion of their stock of provisions,--consisting of\r\nthe dried fish,--partly those that had been half cured by Snowball\r\nprevious to the union of the two rafts, and partly the flitches of\r\nshark-meat, that had been taken from the lesser raft, and added to\r\nSnowball's store.\r\n\r\nThese, with the object of having them thoroughly dried, had been exposed\r\nto the sun, on the tops of the water-casks which little William had let\r\nloose.  In the hurry and excitement of the moment, it was not likely the\r\nlad should give a thought to the flitches of fish.  Nor did he; and\r\nwhile freeing the water-casks from their fastenings, and pushing them\r\noff from the raft, the pieces were all permitted to slide off into the\r\nwater, and either swim or go to the bottom, as their specific gravity\r\nmight dictate.  The consequence was, that, when everything else was\r\nrecovered, these were lost,--having actually gone to the bottom, or\r\nfloated out of sight; or, what was more probable than either, having\r\nbeen picked up by the numerous predatory birds hovering in the heavens\r\nabove, or the equally voracious fish quartering the depths of the ocean\r\nunderneath.\r\n\r\nIt was not without some chagrin that Snowball contemplated his reduced\r\nstores,--a chagrin in which his companions could equally participate.\r\nAt the time, however, they felt the misfortune less bitterly than they\r\nmight otherwise have done,--their spirits being buoyed up by the\r\nmiraculous escape they had just made, as well as by a hope that the\r\nlarder so spent might be replenished, and by a process similar to that\r\nby which it had been originally stocked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE ALBACORES.\r\n\r\nThe hope of replenishing their larder was likely to be realised easily,\r\nand ere long.  Scarce had their sail caught the breeze, when they\r\nperceived alongside the _Catamaran_ a shoal of the most beautiful fish\r\nthat are to be found in any part of the boundless ocean.  There were\r\nseveral hundreds in the shoal; like mackerel, all nearly of one size,\r\nand swimming, moreover in the same direction,--just as a school of\r\nmackerel are seen to do.\r\n\r\nThey were much larger, however, than the common mackerel,--each being\r\nabout four feet in length, with a stout, though well-proportioned body,\r\nhaving that peculiar elegance of shape which belongs to all the mackerel\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nTheir colour was sufficient of itself to entitle them to the appellation\r\nof beautiful creatures.  It was a bright turquoise blue or azure,\r\nshowing, in certain lights, a tinge of gold.  This was the colour of\r\ntheir backs; while underneath they were of a silvery white, gleaming\r\nwith a lively iridescence.  A row of spurious fins above the tail, and\r\nanother underneath, were of a bright yellow; while their large round\r\neyes exhibited an iris of silver.\r\n\r\nTheir pectoral fins were very long and sickle-shaped; while the dorsal\r\none, also well developed, presented a structural peculiarity in having a\r\ndeep groove running longitudinally down the spine of the back, into\r\nwhich the fin,--when at rest and depressed,--exactly fitted: becoming so\r\ncompletely sheathed and concealed, as to give to the fish the appearance\r\nof being without this apparatus altogether!\r\n\r\nIf we except their lovely hues, their greater size, and a few other less\r\nnotable circumstances, the fishes in question might have been taken for\r\nmackerel; and it would have been no great mistake to so describe them:\r\nsince they were in reality of this genus.  They were of a different\r\nspecies, however,--the most beautiful species of the mackerel tribe.\r\n\r\n\"Albacore!\" cried Ben Brace, as soon as he saw them shooting alongside\r\nthe raft.  \"Albacore be they.  Now, Snowy, out wi' your hooks an' lines.\r\nIn this fresh breeze they be a'most sure to bite; and we'll be able, I\r\nhope, to make up for the loss o' the others.  Hush all o' ye!  Ne'er a\r\nword; ne'er a movement to scare 'em off.  Softly, Snowy!  Softly, ye ole\r\nsea-cook.\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear, Massa Brace,--no fear o' dem leabin dis ole _Cat'maran_, so\r\nlong's de be a-gwine on dat fashion.  Looker dar!  Fuss to one side, den\r\nde todder,--back and for'rad as ef de cudn't be content nowha.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Snowball was speaking, and before he had commenced, the albacores\r\nhad entered upon a peculiar movement.  On first joining company with the\r\n_Catamaran_, they swam for a time alongside,--the starboard side,--\r\nkeeping pace with the raft, and evidently making no exertion to go ahead\r\nof her, as they might easily have done.  On the contrary, they scarce\r\nmoved their fins; but floated slowly along at the exact rate of speed at\r\nwhich the craft was sailing, and not one bit faster.  As they swam\r\nparallel to the raft, and also parallel to each other, one might have\r\nfancied them all joined together by some invisible link, that kept them\r\nfrom changing their relative positions both to the _Catamaran_ and to\r\none another!\r\n\r\nAll at once, however, and quick as the change of a kaleidoscope, this\r\nparallelism was terminated,--not as regarded each other, but with\r\nrespect to the course of the _Catamaran_ By a single flutter of their\r\ntails, the whole _school_ was seen simultaneously turning head towards\r\nthe craft; and then, like a flash of lightning, they passed underneath.\r\n\r\nFor a moment they were out of sight; but in the next they appeared on\r\nthe starboard beam, swimming parallel as before, both to the course of\r\nthe _Catamaran_ and to each other.  The manoeuvre was executed with such\r\nprecision and uniformity, as could not be imitated among men,--even\r\nunder the tuition of the ablest drill-sergeant that ever existed.  They\r\nswerved from right to left, as if each and all were actuated by the same\r\nimpulse, and at the same instant of time.  At the same instant their\r\ntails made a movement in the water,--at precisely the same point of time\r\nthey turned together,--showing a list of its silvery abdomen, and with\r\nlike simultaneous action did they dive under the keel of the\r\n_Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nIt was this peculiar manoeuvre on the part of the fish,--won after\r\nrepeated by their shooting back to the starboard, and again returning to\r\nlarboard,--that had elicited from Snowball the assertion, so confidently\r\nput forward, that there was no fear of their leaving the _Catamaran_ so\r\nlong as they were going in that fashion.\r\n\r\nOf those upon the raft, Ben Brace alone comprehended Snowball's meaning.\r\nTo little William it was a matter of some surprise when the ex-sea-cook\r\nspoke so confidently, and acted, moreover, as if he had no fear of\r\nfrightening the shy-looking creatures that were swimming alongside.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Snowy?\" asked the lad,--\"why is there no fear of their being\r\nscared off?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kase, lilly Willy, I hab de idea dar be something else not far off, dat\r\ndem albacore am more feerd on dan we.  I no see dat someting yet.  We\r\nsure see de _long snout_, by 'm by.\"\r\n\r\n\"The long snout!--what do you mean by that, Snowy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha do a mean?--de long-nose a mean.  Tole ye so! dar he be yonner,--\r\nright on de la'bord quarter.  Dis nigger knew he no far off.  Da's why\r\nde beauties hab come roun de raff; an dat I hope keep um hyar till we\r\nhab cotch a few ob dem!\"\r\n\r\n\"A shark!\" cried the boy-sailor, catching a glance of some large fish at\r\nsome distance out in the water on the larboard bow,--the direction in\r\nwhich Snowball had pointed.\r\n\r\n\"Shark! nuffin ob de kind,\" rejoined the negro; \"diff'rent sort ob fish\r\naltogedder.  If him wa shark, de albacore no stay hyar.  Dey go up to\r\nhim, and dart all 'bout im,--jess like de lilly birds when dey see big\r\nhawk or de vulture.  No shark he,--dat ere skulkin' fella.  He am massa\r\nlong-nose,--de real enemy ob de albacore.  No fear ob dem leabin' us,\r\nwhile he anywhar in sight.\"\r\n\r\nSaying this the Coromantee proceeded to single out his hooks; and,\r\nassisted by Ben Brace, commenced baiting them with an unconcern that\r\ntestified a full confidence in the truth of his assertion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE SWORD-FISH.\r\n\r\nLittle William,--whose curiosity had become excited at the appearance of\r\nthe strange fish,--stood looking over the larboard quarter, in hopes of\r\ngetting a better view of it.\r\n\r\nAs yet, he had only obtained a slight glimpse of it: for the larboard\r\nquarter lay towards the south-west, and the sun, just then sinking down\r\nupon the sea, hindered him from having a fair opportunity to scan the\r\nsurface in that particular direction.\r\n\r\nShading his eyes with the palm of his hand, he gazed for some time, but\r\nsaw nothing,--either upon the surface or under it.  Snowball,\r\nnotwithstanding that he seemed wholly occupied with the hooks and lines,\r\ntook notice of the reconnoissance of the sailor-lad.\r\n\r\n\"No use you look dat way, lilly Willy,\" said he.  \"Doan you see dat de\r\nabbacores are now on de larbord side.  Wheneber dey am on de larbord,\r\nyou look for long-nose on de starbord.  Truss dem take care dey no get\r\non de same side wit' dat ere fella.\"\r\n\r\n\"There, Will'm!\" interposed Ben.  \"Look out that way! there he be,--\r\nright astarn,--don't ye see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I see, I see!\" cried William.  \"O, look, Lalee!  What in odd fish it\r\nis!  I never saw one like it before.\"\r\n\r\nThis was true; for although the young sailer had already traversed many\r\na long league of the Atlantic Ocean, he had not yet seen a fish of the\r\nsame kind; and he might traverse hundreds of long leagues of any of the\r\noceans without seeing the like again.\r\n\r\nIt was, in truth, one of the most singular denizens of the great deep\r\nthat had thus come under the observation of the _Catamaran's_ crew,--so\r\npeculiar in its appearance that, without the intervention of Ben Brace,\r\nwho at that moment called out in name, the boy could have pronounced it\r\nfor himself.\r\n\r\nIt was a fish of some eight or ten feet in length; with a long bony\r\nsnout, projecting horizontally forward, at least one third of the length\r\nof its body.  This snout was nothing more than a prolongation of the\r\nupper jaw,--perfectly straight, of osseous structure, and tapering\r\ntowards the end like the blade of a rapier.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the fish was not ill-formed; nor did it present that hideous\r\naspect characteristic of the more predatory creatures that inhabit the\r\nocean.  For all that, there was a certain shyness combined with great\r\nswiftness in its motion,--a skulking in its attitudes: as Snowball's\r\nspeech had already declared,--a truculent, trap-like expression in its\r\nquick watchful eyes, that told of an animal whose whole existence was\r\npassed in the pursuit of prey.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be wondered at that William should have mistaken the\r\ncreature for a shark: for, in addition to the fact of the sun being in\r\nhis eyes, there were points of similarity between the fish in question,\r\nand certain species of sharks, requiring a good view and an experienced\r\nobserver to tell the difference.  William perceived a large crescent\r\nshaped fin rising several inches above the surface of the water,--a tail\r\nlunated like that of the shark,--a hungry eye, and prowling attitude:\r\nthe very characteristics of the dreaded tyrant of the deep.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing in which the creature in question differed\r\nmaterially from all the individuals of the _squalus_ tribe.  Instead of\r\nswimming slowly, it appeared to be one of the swiftest of fishes: for at\r\neach instant as the albacores changed their position from one side of\r\nthe raft to the other, the long-snouted creature was seen to shoot to\r\nthe same side with a velocity that almost baffled the sight to keep pace\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the eye could scarcely have traced its course, had it not been\r\naided by two circumstances altogether strange and peculiar.  The first\r\nwas that the strange fish, while darting from point to point, caused a\r\nrushing sound in the water; like that produced by heavy rain falling\r\nupon the leaves of a forest.  The second peculiarity was, that while\r\nthus progressing its hues became completely changed.  Instead of the\r\ndull brown,--its colour when at rest,--its body presented a striated\r\nappearance,--a brindling of bright and dark blue,--sometimes heightened\r\nto a uniform azure!\r\n\r\nIt was not these peculiarities that had guided little William to the\r\nidentification of the species; but the long, tapering snout, straight as\r\na rapier, that projected in front of its body.  This was a token not to\r\nbe mistaken,--never to be forgotten by one who had seen it before.  And\r\nthe young sailor had before seen such a one; not at sea, nor under the\r\nsea, but in a collection of \"natural curiosities,\" that had by chance\r\nbeen carried through his native town; and whose inspection, perhaps, had\r\nmuch to do with that impulse that first caused him to \"run away to sea.\"\r\nUnder a glass-case he had examined that piece of osseous structure,\r\ndescribed by the showman as the sword of the _sword-fish_.  Under the\r\nwaves of the tropical Atlantic,--but little less translucent than the\r\nglass,--he had no difficulty in identifying the formidable weapon!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE SWORDSMAN OF THE SEA.\r\n\r\nWhile William was gazing upon the strange fish, it was seen all at once\r\nto make a rush in the direction of the raft.  They could hear a\r\n\"swishing\" sound, as its huge body passed through the water, at the same\r\ntime that its great scimitar-shaped dorsal fin, projecting above the\r\nsurface, rapidly traced a rippling line through the whole of its course.\r\n\r\nThe dash was evidently directed against the shoal of albacore swimming\r\nalongside the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nBut these creatures were constantly on the alert.  Although exhibiting\r\nevery symptom of fright, they did not seem for an instant to lose their\r\npresence of mind; and as the sword-fish was seen rushing towards them,\r\nall turned as if by a common impulse, and, quick as lightning, passed to\r\nthe other side of the raft.\r\n\r\nThe sword-fish, seeing himself foiled, checked the velocity of his\r\ncharge with a suddenness that displayed his great natatory powers; and,\r\ninstead of pursuing the albacores under the _Catamaran_, he continued to\r\nfollow after the craft, in a sort of skulking, cowardly fashion,--as if\r\nhe designed to use stratagem rather than strength in the capture of his\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident to little William that the albacores had sought\r\nthe companionship of the _Catamaran_ less from the idea of obtaining any\r\ndroppings there might be from her decks, than as a protection against\r\ntheir formidable pursuer,--the sword-fish.  Indeed, this is most\r\nprobably the reason why not only the albacores and their kindred the\r\nbonitos, but several other kinds of shoal-fish, attach themselves to\r\nships, whales, and other large objects, that they may encounter floating\r\nor sailing upon the open ocean.\r\n\r\nThe mode in which the sword-fish makes his attack,--by rushing\r\nirresistibly upon his prey, and impaling it on his long, slender beak,--\r\nis full of risk to himself; for should his \"sword\" come in contact with\r\nthe sides of a ship, or any substance of sufficient strength to\r\nwithstand his impetuous \"thrust,\" the chances are that the weapon either\r\ngets broken off altogether, or so embedded that the owner of it falls a\r\nvictim to his rash voracity.\r\n\r\nUnder the excitement of fear, and occupied in watching the movements of\r\ntheir enemy, Snowball knew there was no chance of the albacores paying\r\nany attention to the hooks he had baited for them.  Instead, therefore,\r\nof throwing them over the side, he permitted them to lie upon the\r\nplanks, and waited until the sword-fish should either take his departure\r\nor fall far enough into the wake of the _Catamaran_ to permit, on the\r\npart of the creatures swimming alongside, a temporary forgetfulness of\r\nhis presence.\r\n\r\n\"It am no use trowin' dem de hook,\" said he, addressing himself to the\r\nsailor, \"no use jess yet, so long de sharp snout am dar.  We mus' wait\r\ntill he go out ob dar sight an out ob dar hearin too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we must,\" rejoined Ben; \"that be a pity too.  They'd bite\r\ngreedy enough, if the ugly thing warn't there.  That I know, for I've\r\nseed 'em many's the time.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not the only bit of information concerning the albacore and\r\ntheir enemy communicated by the sailor to his companions on the raft,\r\nbut more especially to his _protege_, who, feeling a strange interest in\r\nthose creatures, had asked several questions concerning them.  During\r\nthe interval, while they were waiting for some change in the tactics of\r\nthe pursuer,--hoping that he might get ahead and abandon the pursuit,--\r\nBen imparted to his audience several chapters of his experience,--in\r\nwhich either albacore or sword-fish, and sometimes both, had figured as\r\nthe principal actors.  Among others, he related an anecdote of a ship in\r\nwhich he had sailed having been pierced by the beak of a sword-fish.\r\n\r\nAt the time the incident occurred there was no one on board who had any\r\nsuspicion of its nature.  The crew were below at their dinner; when one\r\nof the sailors who chanced to be on deck heard a loud splashing in the\r\nwater.  On looking over the ship's side, and seeing a large body just\r\nsinking below the surface, the sailor supposed it to be some one of the\r\ncrew who had gone over, and instantly raised the cry of \"A man\r\noverboard!\"\r\n\r\nThe crew were paraded; when it was ascertained that no one was missing.\r\nThough the sailors were at a loss to account for the singular\r\nappearance, the alarm soon subsided; and nothing more was thought of the\r\nmatter.  Shortly after, one of the men,--Ben Brace himself, it was,--\r\nchanced to ascend the rigging; and while aloft he perceived a rugged\r\nmass projecting from the side of the ship, just below the water line.\r\nOn a boat being lowered and the thing examined, it proved to be the\r\n_rostrum_ of a sword-fish, broken off from the animal's head.  It was\r\nthe body of the animal,--no doubt, killed by the concussion,--which the\r\nsailor had seen sinking in the water.\r\n\r\nThe \"sword\" had pierced completely through the copper sheathing and\r\nsolid timbers of the larboard bow of the ship; and on the sailors going\r\nbelow, they found eight or ten inches of its top projecting into the\r\ninside, embedded among some coals contained in the hold!\r\n\r\nSingular as the sailor's story might appear, it was not in the least an\r\nexaggeration.  Snowball knew it was not: for the ex-sea-cook could have\r\ntold of like experiences; and William was also satisfied of its truth,\r\nfrom having read the account of a similar incident, and heard that the\r\nevidences of it,--that is, a piece of the solid wood of the ship's\r\ntimbers, with the sword imbedded in it,--were to be seen at any time in\r\nthe British Museum.\r\n\r\nJust as Ben had finished his curious relation, a movement upon the part\r\nof the pursuer told an intention of changing his tactics,--not as if he\r\nwas about to retreat, but rather to assume a bolder attitude of offence.\r\nThe sight of such a fine shoal of fat albacores,--so near and yet so\r\nlong keeping clear of his attack, appeared to have tantalised him to a\r\npoint beyond endurance; and, being extra hungry, perhaps he was\r\ndetermined to dine upon them, _coute qui coute_.\r\n\r\nWith this intent he drew nearer to the _Catamaran_ swooping from quarter\r\nto quarter, then along the sides, and once or twice darting ahead, so as\r\nto create in the shoal a degree of excitement that might force them into\r\nirregularity of action.\r\n\r\nThis very effect he at length succeeded in producing; for the pretty\r\ncreatures became more frightened than ever; and instead of swimming, as\r\nhitherto, in concert, and parallel to each other as they had been doing,\r\nthey got huddled into a crowd, and commenced darting, pell-mell, in\r\nevery direction.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their confusion a large band became separated,--not only\r\nfrom the others, but from the _Catamaran_,--and fell several fathoms'\r\nlength into the wake of the craft.\r\n\r\nUpon these the hungry eyes of the prowling monster were now fixed; but\r\nonly for a moment: for in the next he was charging down among them with\r\na velocity that caused the water to spray upwards against his dorsal\r\nfin, while the rushing sound made by his body could be heard afar off\r\nover the ocean, \"Look, Will'm!\" cried Ben, anxious that his _protege_\r\nshould not miss seeing the curious spectacle.  \"Look, lad! yonder's a\r\nsight worth seein'.  Shiver my timbers, if he han't got a brace o' 'em\r\non his toastin' fork!\"\r\n\r\nWhile Ben was speaking, the sword-fish had charged into the middle of\r\nthe frightened flock.  There was a momentary plashing,--as several of\r\nthe albacores leaped up out of the water and fell back again,--there was\r\na surging and bubbling over a few yards of surface, which hindered a\r\nclearer view of what was passing; and then outside reappeared the\r\nsword-fish, with his long weapon projected above the water, and a brace\r\nof the beautiful albacores impaled upon its point!\r\n\r\nThe wretched creatures were struggling to free themselves from their\r\npainful position; but their struggles were not for long.  They were\r\nterminated almost on the instant,--by the sword-fish giving a quick jerk\r\nof his head, and tossing, first one and then the other of his victims\r\nhigh into the air!\r\n\r\nAs they came down again, it was to fall, not upon the water, but into\r\nthe throat of the voracious tyrant; who, although toothless and without\r\nany means of masticating, made shorter work of it by introducing them\r\n_untoothed_, and at a single gulp, into his capacious maw!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nANGLING FOR ALBACORE.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the crew of the _Catamaran_ watched the manoeuvres of the\r\nsword-fish with a degree of interest that almost caused them to forget\r\ntheir own forlorn situation.  Little William and Lilly Lalee were\r\nespecially delighted with the singular spectacle; and long after the\r\nsailor and Snowball had turned their attention to other and more\r\nnecessary matters, the two stood side by side gazing out upon the ocean\r\nin the direction in which the sea-swordsman had been seen.\r\n\r\nWe say _had been_ seen: for, after swallowing the brace of albacores,\r\nthe voracious monster had suddenly disappeared, either by diving deep\r\ndown into the sea, or shooting off to some distant point.\r\n\r\nLittle William and Lalee looked everywhere,--first astern, where the\r\nswordsman had made the display of his skill; then on both sides; and,\r\nfinally, ahead.  They looked in these different directions,--because,\r\nfrom what they had already seen of its natative powers, they knew that\r\nthe great fish could pass in a few seconds through a hundred fathoms of\r\nwater, and therefore was as likely to be on one side as the other.\r\n\r\nOn no side, however, could the fish be seen; and, although both the\r\nsailor-lad and Lalee would have been pleased to witness a little more of\r\nthat same sword exercise, they were at length forced to the conclusion\r\nthat the performance was over and the performer gone away,--perhaps, to\r\nexhibit his prowess in some other quarter of the aquatic world.\r\n\r\n\"Berry like,--berry like he gone way,\" said Snowball, in reply to the\r\ninterrogatory of little William.  \"A good ting if dat am de fack; fo'\r\nden we hab chance to hook up some o' dese hya abbacore.  See dem now!\r\nDoan' you see how berry different dey are behavin'.  Dey no longer\r\n'feerd.  Dat am sign dat de long snout hab turn him nose in some oder\r\ndirecshun.  He gone fo' sartin.\"\r\n\r\nSure enough the _behaviour_ of the albacores was very much altered, as\r\nSnowball had affirmed.  Instead of flashing about from one side of the\r\nraft to the other, and exhibiting manifest symptoms of alarm, they now\r\nswam placidly alongside, at a regular rate of speed, just keeping up\r\nwith the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nThey looked, moreover, as if they would now take the bait, which during\r\nthe presence of the sword-fish they had obstinately refused to touch,\r\nthough frequently flung, both by Snowball and the sailor, right under\r\ntheir snouts.\r\n\r\nBoth were again preparing to repeat their angling operations; and in a\r\nfew seconds' time each had his hook ready, with a piece of shark-meat\r\ntemptingly attached to it, the bait being rendered still more attractive\r\nfrom having a little shred of scarlet flannel looped around the shank of\r\nthe hook, while several fathoms of stout sennit-cord served as\r\ntrolling-lines.\r\n\r\nPlash into the water went the two baited hooks, both at once; and,\r\nalmost before the ripples caused by the plunge had ceased to circle upon\r\nthe surface, a still louder plashing could be heard, and a much rougher\r\nripple seen,--in short, a large space of the surface agitated into foam,\r\nwhere a brace of albacores were fluking and struggling on the respective\r\nhooks of Snowball and the sailor.\r\n\r\nRight rapidly were they hauled aboard, and their struggles brought to a\r\ntermination by a smart tap on the head administered to each in\r\nsuccession, by a handspike, which had suddenly found its way into the\r\ngrasp of the sailor.\r\n\r\nNo time was thrown away in contemplating the captives, or triumphing\r\nover their capture.  Little William and Lalee alone examined the two\r\nbeautiful creatures thus brought within their reach; while Snowball and\r\nthe sailor, rapidly readjusting the baits upon their hooks, that had\r\nbeen slightly disarranged by the teeth of the _tunnies_,--for the\r\nalbacore is a species of tunny fish,--once more flung them forth.\r\n\r\nThis time the baits were not so greedily \"grabbed\" at.  As if the\r\n\"school\" had become suspicious, they all for a considerable time fought\r\nshy of it; but, as it was trolled so temptingly under their very snouts,\r\nfirst one and then another began to make approach,--now nearer and\r\nnearer, one or two taking a nibble at it, and then dropping it again,\r\nand suddenly shying off,--as if they had discovered something unpleasant\r\neither in its taste or touch.\r\n\r\nThis delicate nibbling continued for several minutes when, at length, an\r\nalbacore more courageous than its companions, or perhaps with an emptier\r\nstomach than the rest, at sight of the tempting morsel suddenly took\r\nleave of his discretion; and, darting forward, seized the bait upon\r\nBen's hook, swallowing bait, hook, and several inches of the\r\nsennit-cord, at a single gulp!\r\n\r\nThere was no danger of its being able to detach itself from that hook.\r\nThe barb was already fast in its entrails before Ben gave the jerk to\r\nsecure it.  Another jerk brought the fish out of its native element,\r\nlanding it amidships on board the _Catamaran_, where, like its two\r\npredecessors, it was instantly knocked on the head.\r\n\r\nSnowball continued to \"troll\" his line in the most approved fashion; and\r\nwas soon again joined by his brother \"piscator,\" who, after settling the\r\nscores with the second fish he had caught, had adjusted a fresh bait,\r\nand once more flung his line into the water.\r\n\r\nFor some reason or other, the albacores became suddenly shy,--not as if\r\nalarmed at the action of the anglers, but rather from having their\r\nattention attracted to some other object invisible to the eyes of those\r\non the _Catamaran_.  The fish were so near the raft, that every movement\r\nmade by them could be easily observed,--even to the glancing of their\r\nsilvery irides,--and those who observed them could see that they were\r\nlooking aloft.\r\n\r\nUp went the eyes of the _Catamarans_, both anglers and idlers turning\r\ntheir glances towards the sky.  There was nothing to be seen there,--at\r\nleast, nothing to account for the shyness of the fish, or the upward\r\ncast of their eyeballs.  So thought three of the party,--little William,\r\nLalee, and the sailor,--who beheld only the blue, cloudless canopy of\r\nthe heavens.\r\n\r\nSnowball, however, whose single experience of ocean-life was greater\r\nthan the sum total of the other three twice told, did not, like the\r\nrest, desist all at once from his scrutiny of the sky, but remained\r\ngazing with upturned look for period of several minutes.\r\n\r\nAt the termination of that time, an exclamatory phrase, escaping from\r\nhis lips, proclaimed the discovery of some object that, to his mind,\r\naccounted for the odd behaviour of the albacores.\r\n\r\n\"De frigate-bird!\" was the phrase that came mutteringly from between\r\nSnowball's teeth.  \"Ya, ya,--dar am two ob dem,--de cock an' hen, I\r\ns'pose.  Dat 'counts for de scariness of dese hya fish.  Dat's what am\r\ndoin' it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, a frigate-bird!\" said Ben Brace, recognising in Snowball's synonyme\r\none of the most noted wanderers of the ocean,--the _Pelicanus aquila_ of\r\nthe naturalists, but which, from its swift flight and graceful form, is\r\nbetter known to mariners under the appellation given to it by Snowball.\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\" interrogated the sailor.  \"I don't see bird o' any sort.\r\nWhere away, Snowy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Up yonner,--nearly straight ober head,--close by dat lilly 'peck ob\r\ncloud.  Dar dey be, one on de one side, odder on fodder,--de ole cock\r\nan' de ole hen, I'se be boun!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your daylights be uncommon clear, nigger.  I don't see ne'er a bird--\r\nAh, now I do!--two of 'em, as you say.  Ye're right, Snowy.  Them be\r\nfrigates to a sartainty.  It's easy to tell the cut o' thar wings from\r\nany other bird as flops over the sea.  Beside, there be no other I knows\r\non as goes up to that height.  Considerin' that thar wings be spread\r\nnigh a dozen feet, if not all o' that, and that they don't look bigger\r\nthan barn-swallows, I reckon they must be mor'n a mile overhead o' us.\r\nDon't you think so, Snowy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mile, Massa Brace!  Ya, dey am two mile 'bove us at de berry lees.  Dey\r\ndoan' 'peer to move an inch from dat same spot.  Dar be no doubt dat\r\nboaf o' 'em am sound 'sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Asleep!\" echoed little William, in a tone that betokened a large\r\nmeasure of astonishment.  \"You don't say, Snowball, that a bird can go\r\nto sleep upon the wing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoo! lilly Willy, dat all you know 'bout de birds in dis hya part ob\r\ndo worl'?  Sleep on de wing!  Sartin dey go 'sleep on de wing, an' some\r\ntime wif de wing fold close to dar body, an' de head tuck under 'im,--\r\ndon't dey, Mass' Brace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ain't sartin as to that,\" doubtingly answered the\r\nex-man-o'-war's-man.  \"I've heerd so: but it _do_ seem sort o'\r\nunnat'ral.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoo!\" rejoined Snowball, with a slightly derisive inclination of the\r\nhead; \"why for no seem nat'ral?  De frigate hersef she sleep on de water\r\nwidout sails set,--not eben a stitch ob her canvas.  Well, den: why no\r\ndem frigate-birds in de air?  What de water am to de ship de air am to\r\nde birds.  What hinder 'em to take dar nap up yonner, 'ceptin' when\r\ndar's a gale ob wind?  Ob coos dat u'd interrup' dar repose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, nigger,\" rejoined the sailor, in a tone that betokened no very\r\nzealous partisanship for either side of the theory, \"you may be right,\r\nor you may be wrong.  I ar'n't goin' to gi'e you the lie, one way or t'\r\nother.  All I know is, that I've seed frigates a-standing in the air, as\r\nthem be now, making way neyther to windart or leuart; f'r all that I\r\ndidn't believe they was asleep.  I kud see thar forked tails openin' and\r\nclosin' jist like the blades o' a pair o' shears; and that inclined me\r\nto think they war wide awake all the time.  If they was asleep, how kud\r\nthey a-kep waggin' thar tails?  Though a bird's tail be but feathers,\r\nstill it must ha' some feelin' in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Law, Massa Ben!\" retorted the negro, in a still more patronising tone,\r\nas if pitying the poverty of the sailor's syllogism, \"you no tink it\r\npossible that one move in dar sleep?  You nebber move you big toe, or\r\nyou foot, or some time de whole ob you leg?  Beside,\" continued the\r\nlogician, passing to a fresh point of his argument, \"how you s'pose de\r\nfrigate-bird do 'idout sleep?  You know berry well he not got de power\r\nto swim,--him feet only half web.  He no more sit on de water dan a\r\nguinea-fowl, or a ole hen ob de dunghill.  As for him go 'sleep on de\r\nsea, it no more possyble dan for you or me, Massa Ben.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Snowy,\" slowly responded the sailor, rather pushed for a reply,\r\n\"I'm willin' to acknowledge all that.  It look like the truth, an' it\r\ndon't,--both at the same time.  I can't understan' how a bird can go to\r\nsleep up in the air, no more'n I could hang my old tarpaulin' hat on the\r\ncorner o' a cloud.  Same time I acknowledge that I'm puzzled to make out\r\nhow them thar frigates can take thar rest.  The only explanation I can\r\nthink o' is, that every night they fly back to the shore, an' turns in\r\nthar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoogh!  Massa Brace, you knows better dan dat.  I'se heerd say dat de\r\nfrigate-bird nebber am seed more'n a hunder league from de shore.  Dam!\r\nDis nigga hab seed dat same ole cock five time dat distance from land,--\r\nin de middle ob de wide Atlantic, whar we sees 'um now.  Wish it was\r\ntrue he nebber 'tray more dan hunder knots from de land; we might hab\r\nsome chance reach it den.  Hunder league!  Golly! more'n twice dat\r\nlength we am from land; and dere 's dem long-wing birds hov'rin' 'bove\r\nour heads, an sleepin' as tranquil as ebber dis nigga did in de caboose\r\nob de ole _Pandora_.\"\r\n\r\nBen made no reply.  Whether the reasoning of the Coromantee was correct\r\nor only sophistical, the facts were the same.  Two forms were in the\r\nsky, outlined against the back ground of cerulean blue.  Though distant,\r\nand apparently motionless, they were easily distinguishable as living\r\nthings,--as birds,--and of a kind so peculiar, that the eye of the rude\r\nAfrican, and even that of the almost equally rude Saxon, could\r\ndistinguish the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE FRIGATE-BIRD.\r\n\r\nThe frigate-bird (_Pelicanus aquila_), which had thus become the subject\r\nof conversation on board the _Catamaran_, is in many respects very\r\ndifferent from other ocean-birds.  Although generally classed with the\r\npelicans, it bears but a very slight resemblance to any species of these\r\nmisshapen, unwieldy, goose-like creatures.\r\n\r\nIt differs from most other birds frequenting the sea in the fact of its\r\nfeet being but slightly webbed, and its claws being _talons_, like those\r\nof hawks or eagles.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, also, does it resemble these last birds,--so much that the\r\nsailors, noting the resemblance, indifferently call it \"sea-hawk,\"\r\n\"man-of-war hawk,\" and \"man-of-war eagle.\"  The last appellation,\r\nhowever, is sometimes given to the great wandering albatross (_Diomedea\r\nexulans_).\r\n\r\nThe male frigate-bird is jet black all over the body; having a red bill,\r\nvery long, vertically flattened, and with the mandibles abruptly hooked\r\ndownwards at the point.  The female differs in colour: being sooty black\r\nabove, and having a large white disc on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe legs are short in proportion to the bulk of the bird; the toes, as\r\nalready stated, being furnished with talons,--the middle one scaly, and\r\nnotched underneath; while the legs are feathered to the feet, showing\r\nanother point of affinity with predatory birds of the land.  Still\r\nanother may be pointed out: in the innermost toe or _pollex_, being\r\nturned outwards, as if intended for perching,--which the frigate-bird\r\nactually does when it visits the shore, often making its nest upon\r\ntrees, and roosting among the branches.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this creature may be regarded as a sort of connecting link\r\nbetween the birds of prey who make their home on the dry land, and the\r\nweb-footed birds that equally lead a predatory life upon the sea.\r\nPerhaps it continues the chain begun by the ospreys and sea-eagles, who\r\ntake most of their food out of the water, but do not stray far from the\r\nshore in search of it.\r\n\r\nThe frigate-bird, a true sea-hawk,--sea-eagle, it may be called, since\r\nits bold, noble qualities entitle it to the name,--makes its excursions\r\nso far from the shore that it is not unfrequently seen in the very\r\nmiddle of the Atlantic.  Now, this is the most curious circumstance in\r\nits history, and one that has hitherto perplexed ornithologists.  Since\r\nits feet are not provided with the \"web,\" it cannot swim a stroke; nor\r\nhas it ever been seen to alight on the water for the purpose of taking\r\nrest.  It is not likely that it can settle on the wave,--the\r\nconformation of its feet and body making this an impossibility.\r\n\r\nHow, then, does it find rest for its tired wings?  This is the question\r\nto which an answer is not easily given.\r\n\r\nThere is a belief, as Ben alleged, that it returns every night to roost\r\nupon the land; but when it is considered that to reach its roost would\r\noften require a flight of a thousand miles,--to say nothing of the\r\nreturn journey to its fishing-ground,--the statement at once loses all\r\n_vrai-semblance_, Many sailors say that it goes to sleep suspended aloft\r\nin the air, and so high up as to be sometimes invisible.  This was the\r\nbelief of Snowball.\r\n\r\nNow, this belief, or conjecture, or whatever you may--term it, on the\r\npart of Jack tar, though sneered at as impossible, and even scoffed at\r\nas ridiculous, may, after all, not be so very far beyond the truth.\r\nJack has told some rare tales in his time,--\"yarns\" that appear to be\r\n\"spun\" out of his fancy, quite as much as this one,--which, after having\r\nrun the gauntlet of philosophic ridicule on the part of closet\r\nnaturalists, have in the long run turned out to be true!  Has not his\r\nstory of the \"King of the Cannibal Islands,\"--Hokee-pokee-winkee-wum,\r\nwith his fifty wives as black as \"sut,\" and all his belongings, just as\r\nJack described them,--actually \"turned up\" in reality, in the person of\r\nThakombau and a long line of similar monsters inhabiting the Fiji\r\nIslands?\r\n\r\nWhy, then, may not his statements, about the frigate-bird going to sleep\r\nupon the wing be a correct conjecture, or observation, instead of a\r\n\"sailor's yarn,\"--as sage and conceited, but often mistaken, professors\r\nof \"physical science\" would have us regard it?\r\n\r\nSuch professors as are at this moment, in almost every newspaper in the\r\ncountry,--scientific journals among the number,--abusing and ridiculing\r\nthe poor farmer for destroying the birds that destroy his grain; and\r\ntelling him, if he were to let the birds alone, they would eat the\r\ninsects that commit far greater devastation on his precious _cerealia_!\r\nConceited theorists! it has never occurred to them, that the victims of\r\nthe farmer's fowling-piece--_the birds that eat corn--would not touch an\r\ninsect if they were starving_!  The farmer does not make war on the\r\ninsect-eating birds.  Rarely, or never, does he expend powder and shot\r\non the swallow, the wagtail, the tomtit, the starling, the thrush, the\r\nblackbird, the wren, the robin, or any of the grub and fly-feeders.  His\r\n\"game\" are the buntings and _Fringillidae_,--the larks, linnets,\r\nfinches, barley-birds, yellowhammers, and house sparrows, that form the\r\ngreat flocks afflicting him both in seed-time and harvest; and none of\r\nwhich (excepting, perhaps, the last-mentioned gentry, who are at times\r\nslightly inclined towards a wormy diet) would touch an insect, even with\r\nthe tips of their bills.  Ha! ye scribblers of closet conceits! you have\r\nbeen sneering at \"Chaw-bacon\" long enough.  He may turn and scoff at\r\nyou; for, in very truth, the boot (of ignorance) is upon the other leg!\r\n\r\nLet us make sure then, lest Jack's theory regarding the lumbers of the\r\nsea-hawk be not mythical in the mirror of our own incredulity.\r\n\r\nThat the bird can take rest in the air is perfectly certain.  It may be\r\nseen--as the crew of the _Catamaran_ saw it--suspended on outspread\r\nwing, without any perceptible motion except in its tail; the long,\r\nforked feathers of which could be observed opening and closing at\r\nintervals; according to the sailor's simile, like the blades of a pair\r\nof scissors.  But this motion might be merely muscular, and compatible\r\nwith a state of slumber or unconscious repose.  At all events, the bird\r\nhas been seen to keep its place in the air for many minutes at a time,\r\nwith no other motion observable than that of the long and\r\ngracefully-forking feathers of its tail.\r\n\r\nA fish sleeps suspended in the water without any apparent effort.  Why\r\nnot certain birds in the air, whose body is many times lighter than that\r\nof a fish, and whose skeleton is constructed with air vessels to buoy\r\nthem up into the azure fields of the sky?  The sea-hawk may seldom\r\nrequire what is ordinarily termed rest.  Its smooth, graceful flight\r\nupon wings, which, though slender, are of immense length,--often often\r\nfeet spread,--shows that it is, perhaps, as much at ease in the air as\r\nif perched upon the bough of a tree; and it is certain that its claws\r\nnever clasp branch, nor do its feet find rest on any other object, for\r\nweeks and months together.\r\n\r\nIt is true that while fishing near the shore it usually retires to roost\r\nat night; but afar over the ocean it keeps all night upon the wing.  It\r\ndoes not, like many other ocean-birds,--as the booby, one of its own\r\ngenus,--seek rest upon the spars of ships, though it often hovers above\r\nthe mastheads of sailing vessels, as if taking delight in this\r\nsituation, and not unfrequently seizes in its beak, and tearing away the\r\npieces of coloured cloth fixed upon the vane.\r\n\r\nA curious anecdote is told of a frigate-bird taken while thus\r\noccupied,--its captor being a man who had swarmed up to the masthead and\r\nseized it in his hand.  As this individual chanced to be a landsman,\r\nserving temporarily on board the ship, and being remarkably tall and\r\nslender, the crew of the vessel would never have it otherwise, than that\r\nthe bird, accustomed only to the figure of a sailor, had mistaken its\r\ncaptor for a spare spar, and thus fallen a victim to its want of\r\ndiscernment!\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, the frigate-bird does not _fish_, like other\r\npredatory birds of the ocean.  As it cannot either dive or swim, of\r\ncourse it cannot take fish out of the water.  How, then, does it exist?\r\nWhere finds it the food necessary to sustain existence?  In a word, it\r\ncaptures its prey in the air; and this commonly consists in the various\r\nspecies of flying-fish, and also the _loligo_, or \"flying squids.\"  When\r\nthese are forced out of their own proper element to seek safety in the\r\nair, the frigate-bird, ready to pounce down from aloft, clutches them\r\nbefore they can get back into the equally unsafe element out of which\r\nthey have sprung.\r\n\r\nBesides the flying-fish, it preys upon those that have the habit of\r\nleaping above the surface, and also others that have been already\r\ncaptured by boobies, terns, gulls, and tropic birds, all of which can\r\nboth swim and dive.\r\n\r\nThese the frigate-bird remorselessly robs of their legitimate prize,--\r\nfirst compelling them to relinquish it in the air, and then adroitly\r\nseizing it before it gets back to the water.\r\n\r\nThe storm is the season of plenty to this singular bird of prey; as then\r\nit can capture many kinds of fish upon the surface of the waves.  It is\r\nduring those times when the sea is tranquil or perfectly calm, that it\r\nresorts to the other method,--of forcing the fishing-birds to yield up\r\ntheir prey, often even to disgorge, after having swallowed it!\r\n\r\nIts wondrous powers of flight not only enable it to seize with certainty\r\nthe morsel thus rejected, but so confident is it of its ability in the\r\nperformance of this feat, that, if a fish chance to be awkwardly caught\r\nin its beak, it will fearlessly fling it into the air, and, darting\r\nafter, grasp it again and again, until it gets the mouthful in a\r\nconvenient position for being gulped down its own greedy throat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY NINE.\r\n\r\nBETWEEN TWO TYRANTS.\r\n\r\nThe two birds which had attracted the attention of the _Catamaran's_\r\ncrew were seen suddenly to abandon their fixed poise in the air, and\r\ncommence wheeling in circles, or rather in spiral lines that gradually\r\ndescended towards the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nIn a short while they were so low that the scarlet pouch under the\r\nthroat of the male was easily recognisable, swollen out like a goitre;\r\nwhile the elegant conformation of the birds, with their long,\r\nscimitar-shaped wings, and slender forked tails, was sharply defined\r\nagainst the blue background of the sky.\r\n\r\nThe albacores no longer took any notice of the baited hooks; but,\r\ninstead, commenced darting through the water in various directions,\r\nuntil they had got scattered about over the sea.\r\n\r\nWas it fear of the predatory birds hovering above that was producing\r\nthis change in their tactics?\r\n\r\nIt could not be that.  They did not appear to be acting under any alarm;\r\nbut rather as if prowling in search of something not yet visible either\r\nto them or to those who were watching them from the deck of the\r\n_Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nBen Brace and Snowball knew the fish were not frightened by the presence\r\nof the birds; but William, whose experience of sea-life was more\r\nlimited,--although the albacores did not look alarmed,--thought,\r\ndoubtingly, that they were so.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" said he, appealing to his older companions, \"such big fish\r\nneedn't be scared of them?\"\r\n\r\nAs he put the interrogatory, he pointed upward to the two birds, now\r\nwithin a hundred fathoms of the surface.  \"Surely they can't kill an\r\nalbacore?  If they did, they could never swallow it, I should think?\"\r\n\r\n\"'T ain't the albacore they be after,\" replied Ben Brace, \"nor be the\r\nalbacore afeerd o' them,--not a bit.  There be another sort o' fishes\r\nnot far away, though we can't see 'em.  No more do these sky-blue chaps\r\nas be swimming around us.  They be now lookin' for 'em,--mighty sharp,\r\nas ye see; an' they'll be sartin to scare 'em up in three shakes o' a\r\nshark's tail.\"\r\n\r\n\"What other sort of fish?\" inquired William.\r\n\r\n\"Flyin'-fish, lad; same's you an' I made our first meal on, when we wur\r\nwellnigh starvin'.  There's a school not far off.  The frigates has\r\nspied 'em from aloft, an' that's what's brought them hoverin' over.\r\nThey've seed the albacores too; and as they know that these preys on the\r\nflyin'-fish, they've come down to be nearer thar game.  Unless the\r\nalbacores get thar eyes on the winged fish, and run down among 'em,\r\nthere'll be no chance for the frigates.  They can do nothin' till t'\r\nother jumps 'em out o' the water.  The sky-blues don't seem to see 'em\r\nyet; but I dare say it'll not be long afore they do, judgin' by their\r\nmanoeuvres.  Thar!  Didn't I tell thee, lad?  See yonder!  They be off\r\nafter something.\"\r\n\r\nAs the sailor spoke, several of the albacores were seen suddenly heading\r\nin a direction parallel to the course of the _Catamaran_ and passing\r\nrapidly through the transparent water.\r\n\r\nIn an instant after, several white objects were seen springing up before\r\nthem, which, after glancing for a moment in the air, plunged back again\r\ninto the water.\r\n\r\nNot any of the _Catamaran's_ crew were ignorant of the character of\r\nthese objects.  The silvery sheen of translucent wings, as they\r\nglittered under the bright sunbeams, proclaimed the creatures to be a\r\n\"flock\" of flying-fish, of which the albacores--of all their many\r\nenemies the most dangerous--were now in pursuit.\r\n\r\nThere may have been several of the flying-fish that did not rise into\r\nthe air, but fell a prey to their pursuers under the water; and of those\r\nthat did succeed in springing above the surface there were two that\r\nnever came down again,--at least not in the shape of flying-fish.\r\n\r\nThe sea-hawks, wheeling above both pursuers and pursued, had been\r\nwatching their opportunity; and as the pretty creatures made their\r\nappearance above water, both the birds swooped straight down among the\r\nprinkling cohort, each selecting a victim.  Both made a successful\r\nswoop; for they were observed to turn and fly with a slant upwards, each\r\nwith a flying-fish in its beak.\r\n\r\nOne of them, the male bird, didn't appear to be satisfied with the hold\r\nhe had taken; for, with a sudden jerk of his head, he let go again,\r\npitched the prey several feet upward, and again as it came down took a\r\nfresh \"grip\" upon it.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this was to his satisfaction, for almost in the same instant\r\nthat the flying-fish returned within the mandibles of his beak it\r\ndisappeared, wings and all, down that dark passage, where, no doubt,\r\nmany another of its kind had preceded it.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that neither of the birds considered one flying-fish\r\nsufficient for a meal; for as soon as they had swallowed those already\r\ntaken, they again placed themselves in position for shooting down upon a\r\nsecond victim.\r\n\r\nAnd now the crew of the _Catamaran_ had the fortune to witness one of\r\nthose singular incidents that may sometimes be seen upon the ocean,--a\r\nlittle drama of Nature, in which three of her creatures,--all three\r\ndiffering in kind,--formed the _dramatis persona_.\r\n\r\nThe cock frigate-bird, on turning to look for a fresh victim, espied\r\none, or that which was likely to become one, almost directly beneath\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was a single flying-fish, which by some chance,--perhaps from not\r\nbeing either so fast a swimmer or so swift upon the wing as its\r\nfellows,--had lagged behind the \"school.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no longer playing laggard, and for a very good reason: since an\r\nalbacore, nearly full three feet in length, was swimming after it and\r\ndoing his very best to overtake it.  Both were exerting every bit of\r\nmuscular strength that lay in their fins,--the former to make its\r\nescape, the latter to prevent this consummation.\r\n\r\nIt was evident, however, to those on board the _Catamaran_, that the\r\npursuer was gaining upon the pursued; and this at length became also\r\nevident to the flying-fish.  The tiny creature, as it cut through the\r\nclear water, could be seen quivering with fear; and the spectators\r\nlooked to see it shoot upward into the air, and thus disappoint the\r\ngreedy tyrant at its tail.\r\n\r\nNo doubt this would have been the very course of conduct for the\r\nflying-fish to have pursued; and no doubt it was on the eve of adopting\r\nit, when, all at once, the long, shadowy wings and outstretched neck of\r\nthe frigate-bird were seen outlined above.\r\n\r\nThe sight was sufficient to keep the fish under water a while longer,\r\nbut only a very little while.  Above were that ugly red pouch and\r\ncraning neck; below, those hideous jaws, ready to open and engulf it.\r\n\r\nThere seemed no chance of escape.  It was only a question of choice as\r\nto the mode of death: whether it would prefer to become food for a fish,\r\nor be devoured by a bird.\r\n\r\nAs, in itself, it partook a little of the nature of, or, at all events,\r\nof the habits of both, there was not much to choose between them; but\r\nwhether it did not desire to deliver itself over to the enemy most like\r\nto itself, or whether it was that the latter was now so near as to be\r\nalmost certain of seizing it, it declared its preference for the bird by\r\nmaking a sudden spring which carried it clear out of the water, and into\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nThe sea-hawk hovering above in eager expectation lost no time in making\r\nthe attempt to secure it; but whether he was too sure of his prize, or\r\nfrom some other unexplained reason, certain it is that he gave a\r\npractical illustration of the old and well-known adage about the cup and\r\nthe lip, by failing to clutch the prey.\r\n\r\nHe was seen darting towards it with open beak,--his talons cruelly\r\nextended for its capture; but, notwithstanding all his activity, the\r\nwhite object that shot glittering past him, and dropped into the sea far\r\nbeyond, proclaimed to the Catamarans that the _Exocetus_ had escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY.\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL MAKING A SOMERSAULT.\r\n\r\nAnd now all eyes were turned towards the sea-hawk, and became fixed upon\r\nhim with glances that expressed surprise; for, instead of again soaring\r\nupward, and renewing his pursuit either of the creature that he had so\r\nclumsily permitted to escape him, or some other of its kind, the bird\r\nwas seen to stay down upon the surface of the sea,--his wings spread to\r\ntheir full extent, and flapping the water with such violence as to raise\r\nthe spray in a thick cloud over and around him!\r\n\r\nHe was heard, too, giving utterance to loud and repeated screams,--not\r\nin the tone of a conqueror; but as if he was in danger of being\r\nvanquished, or had already become the victim of some ocean tyrant\r\nstronger than himself!\r\n\r\nFor some seconds this inexplicable movement,--a struggle it seemed,--\r\ncontinued; not in one place, but over a space of many square yards of\r\nsurface,--which appeared to be also agitated by the exertions of some\r\ncreature underneath; the bird all the while repeating its cries, and\r\nbeating the water into froth, like a huge pelican at play!\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Catamaran_, utterly unable to account for this strange\r\nconduct on the part of the old cock, stood upon the deck of their craft,\r\nlooking on with feelings of intense astonishment.\r\n\r\nEven Snowball, who thought himself _au fait_ to every incident of\r\nocean-life, was surprised and puzzled equally with the rest.\r\n\r\n\"What be the matter wi' the creetur, Snowy?\" inquired Ben, thinking\r\nSnowball could explain its odd behaviour.  \"The frigate 'pears to ha'\r\ngot on its beam-end; shiver my timbers if 't ain't goin' to founder!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shibber ma timber, too,\" rejoined Snowball, rudely pirating the\r\nsailor's favourite shibboleth; \"shibber 'um, if dis nigga know what am\r\nde matter.  Golly! someting got de ole hawk by de legs,--dat seem\r\nsartin.  Maybe 'um be shark, maybe 'um be long-nose--de--\"\r\n\r\nSnowball was going to say \"sword-fish,\" had he been permitted to finish\r\nhis speech.  But he was not; for while in the act of its delivery, with\r\nthe whites of his eyes rolling in conjectural wonder, something from\r\nbelow struck the plank, upon which he was standing, and with such a\r\nshock that the piece of timber was started from its fastenings, and\r\nimpelled suddenly upwards,--not only knocking the ex-sea-cook out of his\r\nperpendicular position, but pitching him, as from a catapult, clear\r\nacross the _Catamaran_, and into the sea on the opposite side!\r\n\r\nThis was not all.  The plank from which Snowball had been projected\r\ninstantly fell back into its place,--in consequence of its being one of\r\nthe heaviest pieces of timber in the raft,--but instead of remaining\r\nthere, it was again seen to shoot upward, then fall back upon the water,\r\nas if dragged down by a powerful but invisible hand,--the hand of some\r\nsea-god or demon,--perhaps of Neptune himself!\r\n\r\nNot only the plank, but the whole raft moved under this inexplicable\r\nimpulsion,--which had communicated to it a rocking motion, not from side\r\nto side, but upwards and downwards!  So quick and violent was this\r\nmysterious oscillation, that it was with difficulty the three\r\nindividuals who still occupied the decks of the craft could keep either\r\ntheir balance or their feet.\r\n\r\nAlong with the motion of the raft there was a corresponding commotion in\r\nthe water,--accompanied by a loud splashing noise that seemed to proceed\r\nfrom under the timbers, on which, like so many acrobats, they were\r\nendeavouring to balance themselves; and in a few seconds after they had\r\nfelt the great shock, the sea all around exhibited a surface of high\r\nwaves crested with foam!\r\n\r\nSnowball, who had risen to the surface after the somersault that had\r\nplunged him deep down into the sea, perceiving that the raft still\r\ncontinued to heave upward and downward, made no attempt to get on board;\r\nbut swimming alongside, sputtered forth his terrified ejaculations.\r\nEven the brave man-o'-war's-man, who had faced death in a thousand\r\nshapes, was, at that moment, the victim of fear.\r\n\r\nHow could it be otherwise?  He could think of nothing in nature capable\r\nof causing that mysterious commotion and who, without trembling, could\r\nwithstand the assaults of the supernatural?\r\n\r\n\"Shiver my timbers!\" cried Ben, himself shivering as he spoke the words,\r\n\"what in old Nick's name has got under us?  Be it a whale that's bumpin'\r\nits back against the rail?  Or--\"\r\n\r\nBefore he could pronounce the second interrogatory, a loud crash sounded\r\nin the ears of all,--as if the plank heaving so mysteriously had been\r\nsuddenly torn in twain!\r\n\r\nThis sound, whatever had caused it, seemed to proclaim the climax of the\r\ncommotion: for immediately after the _Catamaran_ began to compose\r\nherself, the waves caused by her continued rocking gradually grew less,\r\nuntil at length, once more \"righted,\" she lay in her customary position\r\nupon the tranquil surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY ONE.\r\n\r\nA THRUST THROUGH AND THROUGH.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the _Catamaran_ had fairly recovered her equilibrium,\r\nSnowball condescended to climb aboard.  The ludicrous appearance of the\r\nnegro, as he stood dripping upon the deck, might have excited laughter;\r\nbut neither Ben Brace, nor his acolyte, nor the little Lalee, were in a\r\nmood for mirth.  On the contrary, the curious incident that had just\r\noccurred was yet unexplained; and the awe with which it had inspired\r\nthem still continued to hold all three in a sort of speechless control.\r\nSnowball himself was the first to break silence.\r\n\r\n\"Good Gorramity!\" he exclaimed, his teeth chattering like castanets, as\r\nthe words passed between them.  \"Wha's all de rumpus 'bout?  Wha you\r\ntink, Massa Ben?  Wha make dat dratted fuss under de raff?  De water be\r\nplash bout so I've see nuffin, 'cepting a big black heap o' someting.\r\nGolly!  I b'lieve it war de _jumbe_,--de debbil!\"\r\n\r\nThe terrified looks of the speaker, while giving utterance to these\r\nwords,--especially when pronouncing the dreaded name of the _jumbe_--\r\ntold that he was serious in what he said; and that he actually believed\r\nthe devil to have been the agent who had been causing the mysterious\r\ncommotion!\r\n\r\nThe English sailor, though not entirely free from a certain tinge of\r\nsuperstition, did not share Snowball's belief.  Though unable, by any\r\nexperience he had ever gone through, to account for the odd incident,\r\nstill he could not ascribe it to supernatural agency.  The blow which\r\nstarted the plank on which Snowball had been standing had communicated a\r\nshock to the whole structure.  It might have been given by some huge\r\nfish, or other monster of the deep; and though unaccountable and\r\nunexpected, might, nevertheless, be quite natural.  It was the shaking\r\nwhich the _Catamaran_ kept up afterwards,--almost to the spilling of the\r\nwhole crew into the water,--that most perplexed the old\r\nman-o'-war's-man.  He could not imagine why a fish, or any other\r\ncreature, having butted its head once against the \"keel\" of the craft,\r\nwould not instantly desist from such an idle encounter, and make off as\r\nfast as fins could carry it.\r\n\r\nBen's first impression was, that a whale had by chance risen under the\r\nraft; as he had known them to do against the sides of ships.  But then\r\nthe persistence of the creature, whatever it was, in its odd attack,\r\nargued something more than accident.  On the other hand, if the attack\r\nwas designed, and had been made by a whale, of whatever species, the\r\nsailor knew that it would not have left off after merely shaking the\r\nraft.  A whale, with a single flirt of his tail, would have sent the\r\nwhole structure flying into the air, sunk it down into the deep, or\r\nscattered it in fifty fragments over the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nOne of these things a whale would undoubtedly have done.  So believed\r\nBen Brace; and therefore the creature that had come so near capsizing\r\nthem could not be a whale.  What was it, then?  A shark?  No.  It could\r\nnot be a shark.  Though there are two or three species of these\r\nmonsters, quite as large as good-sized whales, the sailor never knew of\r\ntheir assaulting anything after that fashion.\r\n\r\nAs they stood speculating on the cause of their curious adventure, a\r\nshout from Snowball announced that the ex-cook had at length discovered\r\nthe explanation.\r\n\r\nSnowball's first thought, after having partially recovered from his\r\nfright, was to examine the plank from which, like an acrobat from his\r\nspring-board, he had made that involuntary somersault.\r\n\r\nThere, just by the spot on which he had been standing, appeared an\r\nobject that explained everything: a sharp, bony, proboscis-like\r\nimplement, standing up a full foot's length out of the timber, slightly\r\nobliqued from the perpendicular, and as firmly imbedded in the wood as\r\nif it had been driven in by the blows of a blacksmith's hammer!\r\n\r\nThat it had penetrated the plank from underneath could be easily seen,\r\nby the ragged edge, and split pieces around the orifice where it came\r\nout.\r\n\r\nBut the negro did not stay to draw deductions of this nature.  On\r\ncatching sight of the object,--which he knew had not been there\r\nbefore,--his terror at once came to an end; and a long cachinnation,\r\nintended for a peal of laughter, announced that \"Snowball was himself\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Golly!\" he exclaimed.  \"Look dar, Massa Brace.  Look at de ting dat hab\r\ngub us sich a frightnin.  Whuch!  Who'd a beliebed dat de long-nose had\r\ngot so much 'trength in im ugly body?  Whuch!\"\r\n\r\n\"A sword-fish!\" cried Ben.  The rostrum of one of these singular\r\ncreatures was the sharp bone protruding above the plank.  \"You're right,\r\nSnowy, it be a sword-fish, and nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only de snout o' one,\" jocularly rejoined the negro.  \"De karkiss ob de\r\nanymal an't dar any more.  Dat was de black body I seed under de raff;\r\nbut he an't dar now.  He hab broke off him long perbossus; and no doubt\r\ndat hab killed him.  He gone dead, and to de bottom, boaf at de same\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" assented the sailor.  \"It must have broke off while he was\r\nstruggling to get clear, I heerd the crash o't, like the partin' o' a\r\nspar; and just after, the raft stopped shakin', an' began to settle down\r\nagain.  Lor ha mercy on us! what a thrust he have made!  That plank be\r\nfive inches thick, at the very least, an' you see he's stuck his snout\r\nthrough it more'n a foot!  Lor 'a mercy on us!  What wonderful queery\r\ncreeturs the ocean do contain!\"\r\n\r\nAnd with this philosophic reflection, from the lips of the\r\nman-o'-war's-man, ended the adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY TWO.\r\n\r\nAN AWKWARD GRIP.\r\n\r\nTo the two oldest of the _Catamaran's_ crew the curious circumstances of\r\nthe sword-fish thrusting his rostrum through the raft, and snapping it\r\nasunder, needed no explanation.  Both knew that it was not with an\r\nintention of attacking the _Catamaran_ that the \"stab\" had been given;\r\nnor was the act a voluntary one, in any way.\r\n\r\nNot likely, indeed; since it had proved fatal to the swordsman himself.\r\nNo one doubted his having gone dead to the bottom of the sea: for the\r\nbony \"blade\" was found to have been broken close to the \"hilt,\" and it\r\nwas not possible the owner could exist without this important weapon.\r\nEven supposing that the fearful \"fracture\" had not killed him outright,\r\nthe loss of his long rapier, the only tool by which he could obtain his\r\nliving, would be sure to shorten his lease of life, and the final moment\r\ncould not be long delayed.\r\n\r\nBut neither sailor nor ex-sea-cook had any doubt of the fish having\r\ncommitted suicide, no more than that the act was involuntary.\r\n\r\nThe explanation given by Ben Brace to his _protege_ was simple, as it\r\nwas also rational.  The sword-fish had been charging into a shoal of\r\nalbacores.  Partly blinded by the velocity of its impetuous rush, and\r\npartly by its instinct of extreme voracity,--perhaps amounting to a\r\npassion, it had seen nothing of the raft until its long weapon struck\r\nthe plank, piercing the latter through and through.  Unable to withdraw\r\nits rostrum from the fibrous wood, the fish had instantly inaugurated\r\nthat series of struggles, and continued them, until the crash came,\r\ncaused, no doubt, by the upheaved raft lurching suddenly down in a\r\ndirection transverse to its snout.\r\n\r\nOnly a part of this explanatory information was extended to little\r\nWilliam: for only a part was required.  From some previous talk that had\r\noccurred on the same subject, he was already acquainted with a few of\r\nthe facts relating to this foolish fencing on the part of the\r\nsword-fish.\r\n\r\nNor was there at that moment any explanation either offered or asked;\r\nfor, as soon as the _Catamaran_ had settled into her proper position,\r\nand Snowball had got aboard, the eyes of her whole crew,--those of the\r\nCoromantee among the rest,--became once more directed to that which had\r\noccupied their attention previous to receiving the shock,--the strange\r\nbehaviour of the frigate-bird.\r\n\r\nThis creature was still down on the surface of the water, darting from\r\npoint to point, fluttering and flopping, and throwing up the little\r\nclouds of spray, that, surrounding it like a nimbus, seemed to follow it\r\nwherever it went!\r\n\r\nThough Ben Brace and Snowball had been able to explain the action of the\r\nfish, they were both at fault about the behaviour of the bird.  In all\r\ntheir sea experience neither had ever witnessed the like conduct\r\nbefore,--either on the part of a frigate-bird, or any other bird of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they stood watching the creature, and exchanging\r\nconjectures as to the cause of its singular action.  It was clear this\r\nwas not voluntary; for its movements partook of the nature of a\r\nstruggle.  Besides, its screams,--to which it gave an almost continuous\r\nutterance,--betokened either terror or pain, or both.\r\n\r\nBut why did it keep to the surface of the sea, when it was well-known to\r\nbe a bird that could rise almost vertically into the air, and to the\r\nhighest point that winged creatures might ascend?\r\n\r\nThis was the query to which neither sailor nor sea-cook could give a\r\nreply, either with positive truth or probable conjecture.\r\n\r\nFor full ten minutes it remained unanswered; that is, ten minutes after\r\nthe sword-fish adventure had ended, and twenty from the time the\r\nfrigate-bird had been seen to swoop at the flying-fish.  Then, however,\r\nthe problem received its solution; and the play of the _Pelicanus\r\naquila_ was at length explained.\r\n\r\nIt was no play on the part of the unfortunate bird, but a case of\r\ninvoluntary and fearful captivity.\r\n\r\nThe bird had begun to show symptoms of exhaustion, and as its strength\r\nbecame enfeebled, its wings flopped more gently against the water, the\r\nspray no longer rose around it, and the sea underneath was less\r\nagitated.\r\n\r\nThe spectators could now see that it was not alone.  Beneath, and\r\napparently clutching it by the leg, was a fish whose shape, size, and\r\nsheen of azure hue proclaimed it an albacore,--no doubt, the one that\r\nsimultaneously with the bird itself had been balked in the pursuit of\r\nthe flying-fish.\r\n\r\nSo far the detention of the frigate-bird upon the surface of the sea was\r\nexplained; but not sufficiently.  There was still cause for conjecture.\r\nThe albacore seemed equally tired of the connection,--equally exhausted;\r\nand as it swam slowly about,--no longer darting swiftly from point to\r\npoint, as at the beginning of the strife,--the spectators could now see\r\nthat the foot of the sea-hawk, instead of being held between the jaws of\r\nthe fish,--as at first they had supposed it to be,--appeared to be\r\nresting on the back of its head, as if the bird had perched there, and\r\nwas balancing itself on one leg!\r\n\r\nMystery of mysteries!  What could it all mean?\r\n\r\nThe struggles of both bird and fish seemed coming to a termination: as\r\nthey were now only continued intermittently.  After each interval, the\r\nwings of the former and the fins of the latter moved with feebler\r\nstroke; until at length both wings and fins lay motionless,--the former\r\non, the latter _in_, the water.\r\n\r\nBut that the bird's wings were extended, it would, no doubt, have sunk\r\nunder the surface; and the fish was still making feeble endeavours to\r\ndraw it down; but the spread pinions, extending over nearly ten feet of\r\nsurface, frustrated the design.\r\n\r\nIt so chanced that the curious spectacle had occurred directly ahead of\r\nthe _Catamaran_, and the craft, making way down the wind, kept gradually\r\napproaching the scene of the strife.\r\n\r\nEvery moment the respective positions of the two parties revealed\r\nthemselves more clearly; but it was not until the raft swept within\r\nreach, and the exhausted adversaries were both taken up, that the\r\nconnection between them became thoroughly understood.\r\n\r\nThen it was discovered that the contest which had occurred between them\r\nwas on both sides an involuntary affair,--had not been sought by either;\r\nbut was the result of sheer accident.\r\n\r\nHow could it be otherwise: since the albacore is too strong for the beak\r\nof the frigate-bird,--too big for even _its_ capacious throat to\r\nswallow; while, on the other hand, the frigate-bird never ventures to\r\nintrude itself on the cruising-ground of this powerful fish?\r\n\r\nThe accident which had conducted to this encounter, leading to a fatal\r\nentanglement, had been caused by a creature which is the common prey of\r\nboth,--the little flying-fish, that for once had escaped from his\r\nenemies of both elements,--the air and the water.\r\n\r\nIn dashing down upon the flying-fish, the curving talons of the bird,\r\nmissing the object for which they had been braced, entered the eye of\r\nthe albacore.  Partly because they fitted exactly into the socket, and\r\npartly becoming imbedded among the fibrous sutures of the skull, they\r\nremained fixed; so that neither bird nor fish--equally desirous of\r\nundoing the irksome yoke--was able to put an end to the partnership!\r\n\r\nSnowball gave them a divorce, as effectual as could have been obtained\r\nin the court, ever to be noted as that of Sir Cresswell Cresswell.\r\n\r\nThe process was brief,--the execution following quick upon the judgment;\r\nthough the sentences pronounced upon the criminals were not exactly the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThe fish was knocked on the head; while a different, though equally\r\nexpeditious, mode of punishment was executed upon the bird.  Its head\r\nwas twisted from its body!\r\n\r\nThus, somewhat after the fashion of Kilkenny cats, perished two tyrants\r\nof the sea.  Let us hope that the tyrants of the land may all receive an\r\nanalogous compensation for their crimes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY THREE.\r\n\r\nGLOOMY PROSPECTS.\r\n\r\nThe reappearance of the sword-fish,--if it was the same that had already\r\npaid them a visit,--or more likely the discovery and pursuit of the\r\n\"school\" of flying-fish,--had caused the albacores to decamp from the\r\nneighbourhood of the _Catamaran_; so that with the exception of that\r\ntaken from the talons of the frigate-bird, not one was any longer to be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nOnce recovered from the excitement, caused by the singular accident that\r\nhappened to the _Catamaran_,--as well as the other incident almost as\r\nsingular,--her crew made an inspection of their craft, to see if any\r\ndamage had accrued from the shock.\r\n\r\nFortunately there was none.  The piercing of the plank, in which the\r\nbony rostrum remained firmly imbedded, was of no consequence whatever;\r\nand, although several feet of the \"sword,\"--the whole of the blade, in\r\nfact, excepting that which protruded above,--could be perceived jutting\r\nout underneath, they made no attempt to \"extract\" it: since it could not\r\ngreatly interfere with the sailing qualities of the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nThe plank itself had been started slightly out of place aid one or two\r\nother timbers loosened.  But in such able hands as those of Snowball and\r\nthe sailor, these trifling damages were soon made good again.\r\n\r\nThe two baited hooks were once more dropped into the water, but the sun\r\nwent down over the ocean without either of them receiving a nibble.  No\r\nalbacore,--no fish whatever,--no bird,--no living creature of any\r\nkind,--was in sight at the setting of that sun; which, slowly\r\ndescending, as it were, into the silent depths of the ocean, left them\r\nin the purple gleam of the twilight.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the interesting events which had transpired,--enough to\r\nsecure them against a single moment of _ennui_,--they were far from\r\nbeing cheerful in that twilight hour.  The stirring incidents of the day\r\nhad kept them from thinking of their real situation; but when all was\r\nonce more tranquil,--even to the ocean around them,--their thoughts\r\nnaturally reverted to their very narrow chances of ultimately escaping\r\nfrom that wide, wild waste, stretching, as it seemed, to the ends of the\r\nworld!\r\n\r\nWith wistful glances they had watched the sun sinking over the sea.  The\r\npoint where the golden luminary disappeared from their sight was due\r\nwestward,--the direction in which they desired to go.  Could they have\r\nonly been at that moment where his glorious orb was shining down from\r\nthe vertex, they would have been upon dry land; and, O what a thrilling\r\nthought is that of firm stable earth, to the wretched castaway clinging\r\nupon his frail raft in the middle of the endless ocean!\r\n\r\nThey were discouraged by the dead calm that reigned around them; for\r\nevery breath of the breeze had died away before sunset.  The surface of\r\nthe sea was tranquil even to glassiness; and as the twilight deepened,\r\nit began to mirror the millions of twinkling stars gradually thickening\r\nin the sky.\r\n\r\nThere was something awful in the solemn stillness that reigned around\r\nthem; and with something like awe did it inspire them.\r\n\r\nIt was not unbroken by sounds; but these were of a character to sadden\r\nrather than cheer them, for they were sounds to be heard only in the\r\nwilderness of the great deep,--such as the half-screaming laugh of the\r\nsea-mew, and the wild whistle of the boatswain-bird.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of discouragement to our castaways,--one which had that\r\nday arisen,--was the loss of their valuable dried fish.\r\n\r\nIt is true that only a portion of their stock had been spilled into the\r\nengulfing ocean; but even this was a cause of regret; since it might not\r\nbe so easy to make up the quantity lost.\r\n\r\nWhile angling among the albacores, with the prospect of making a\r\nsuccessful troll, they had thought less of it.  Now that these fish had\r\nforsaken them,--leaving only three in their possession,--and they were\r\nin doubt whether they might ever come across another \"school,\"--more\r\nacutely did they feel the misfortune.\r\n\r\nTheir spirits sank still lower, as the descending twilight darkened\r\naround them; and for an hour or more not a cheerful word was heard or\r\nspoken by that sad quartette composing the crew of the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHANKSGIVING.\r\n\r\nDespondency cannot endure forever.  Kind Nature has not ordained that it\r\nshould be so.  It may have its periods, longer or shorter as the case\r\nmay be; but always to be succeeded by intervals, if not of absolute\r\ncheerfulness, at least of emotions less painful to endure.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour after the going down of the sun, the spirits of those on\r\nboard the _Catamaran_ became partially freed from the weight that for\r\nsome time had been pressing upon them.\r\n\r\nOf coarse this change was attributable to some cause; and as it was a\r\nphysical one, there could be no difficulty in tracing it.\r\n\r\nIt was simply the springing up of a breeze,--a fine breeze blowing\r\nsteadily, and to the west,--the very direction in which it was desirous\r\nthey should make way.\r\n\r\nAnd they _did_ make way; the _Catamaran_, in spite of the terrible\r\n\"stab\" she had received, scudding through the water, as if to show that\r\nthe assault of the sword-fish had in no way disabled her.\r\n\r\nMotion has always a soothing effect upon anyone suffering from\r\ndespondent spirits; more especially when the movement is being made in\r\nthe right direction.  A boat stationary in the water, or drifting the\r\nwrong way against the stroke of the rower,--a railway carriage at a\r\nstand, or gliding back to the platform, contrary to the direction in\r\nwhich the traveller intends to go,--such experiences always produce a\r\nfeeling of irksome uneasiness.  When either begins to progress in its\r\nproper course,--no matter how slowly,--the unpleasant feeling instantly\r\npasses away; for we know that we are going \"onward!\"\r\n\r\n\"Onward!\" a word to cheer the drooping spirit,--a glorious word for the\r\ndespondent.\r\n\r\nIt was not that anyone on board the _Catamaran_ had the slightest idea\r\nthat that breeze would waft them to land; or even last long enough to\r\nbear them many leagues over the ocean.  It was the thought that they\r\nwere making progress in the right course,--going _onward_,--simply that\r\nthought that cheered them.\r\n\r\nIt roused them from their despondency sufficiently to beget thoughts of\r\nsupper; and Snowball was seen starting up with some alacrity, and\r\nscrambling towards his _stores_.\r\n\r\nHis \"locker\" lay amidships; and as he had not far to go, nor any great\r\nvariety of comestibles to choose from, he soon returned to the stern,--\r\nnear which the others were seated,--carrying in his outstretched claws\r\nhalf a dozen of the \"pickled\" biscuits, and some morsels of cured fish.\r\n\r\nIt was a coarse and meagre meal; at which even a pauper would have\r\npouted his lips; but to those for whom it was intended it had relish\r\nenough to make it not only acceptable, but welcome.\r\n\r\nA greater delicacy was before their eyes, lying on the deck of the\r\n_Catamaran_.  That was the albacore,--a fish whose _flesh_ is equal in\r\nexcellence to that of any taken out of the ocean.  But the flesh of the\r\nalbacore was _raw_; while that of Snowball's stock, if not cooked, was\r\nat least cured; and this, in the opinion of the Catamarans, rendered it\r\nmore palatable.\r\n\r\nWith a little \"Canary\" to wash it down, it was not to be despised,--at\r\nleast, under the circumstances in which they were who supped upon it;\r\nbut the wine was sparingly distributed, and drunk with a large admixture\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nThe bump of economy stood high upon the skull of the Coromantee.\r\nPerhaps to this might be attributed the fact of his being still in\r\nexistence: since but for the industry he had exhibited in collecting his\r\nstores, and his careful hoarding of them, he might, with his _protege_,\r\nhave long before succumbed to starvation.\r\n\r\nWhile eating their frugal supper, Snowball expressed regret at not\r\nhaving a fire,--upon which he might have cooked a cut from the albacore.\r\nThe _chef-de-caboose_ was not ignorant of the excellence of the fish.\r\n\r\nHe really felt regret,--less on his own account, than in consideration\r\nof his _protege_, Lilly Lalee; whose palate he would fain have indulged\r\nwith something more delicate than sun-dried fish and salty biscuit.\r\n\r\nBut as fire was out of the question, he was compelled to forego the\r\npleasure of cooking Lalee's supper; and could only gain gratification by\r\ngiving to the girl more than her share of the sweet Canary.\r\n\r\nSmall as was the quantity distributed to each, it had the effect of\r\nstill further cheering them; and, after supper, they sat for some time\r\nindulging in lighter converse than that to which they had lately\r\naccustomed themselves.\r\n\r\n\"Somethin'\" said the sailor, \"seem to tell me--jest as if I heerd it in\r\na whisper--that we'll yet reach land, or come in sight o' a ship.  I\r\ndoan' know what puts it in my head; unless it be because we've been so\r\nmany times near going down below, an' still we're above water yet, an' I\r\nhope likely to keep so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ya--ya!  Massa Ben.  We float yet,--we keep so long 's we kin,--dat fo'\r\nsartin.  We nebba say die,--long 's de _Catamaran_ hold togedda.\"\r\n\r\n\"I war 'stonished,\" continued the sailor, without heeding the odd\r\ninterpolation of the sea-cook, \"wonderful 'stonished when that\r\nflyin'-fish chucked itself aboard our bit o' plankin', an' it no bigger\r\nthan the combin' o' a hatchway.  What kud 'a conducted it thear,--to\r\nthat spot above all others o' the broad ocean?  What but the hand o'\r\nthat angel as sits up aloft?  No, Snowy! ye may talk as ye like 'bout\r\nyour Duppys and Jumbes, and that other creetur ye call your Fetush; but\r\nI tell ye, nigger, thear be somethin' up above us as is above all\r\nthem,--an' that's the God o' the Christyun.  He be thear; and He sent\r\nthe flyin'-fish into our wee bit o' raft, and He sent the shower as\r\nsaved me and little Will'm from dyin' o' thust; and He it war that made\r\nyou an' me drift to'rds each other,--so as that we might work thegither\r\nto get out o' this here scrape, as our own foolishness and wickedness\r\nha' got us into.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat am de troof, Massa Brace, dat las' remark,--only not altogedder!\r\n'T want altogedder our own fault dat brought us on board de slabe-ship\r\n_Pandora_,--neider you not maseff.  It mite a been our foolishness, dat\r\nI do admit; but de wickedness war more de fault ob oder men, dat am\r\nwickeder dan eider you or dis unfortunate Coromantee nigga.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Snowy,\" responded the sailor, \"I know there be still some\r\ngood in ye; and maybe there be good in all o' us, to be favoured and\r\nprotected as we've been in the midst o' so many dangers.  I think after\r\nwhat's happened this day,--especially our escaping from that sharks an'\r\nthe long swim as we had to make after'ards,--we ought to be uncommon\r\nthankful, and say somethin' to show it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say something! say what, Massa Brace?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean a prayer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Prayer! wha's dat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, Snowy, you know what a prayer be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nebba heerd ob de ting,--nebba in all ma life!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it be to say somethin' to Him as keeps watch up aloft,--either by\r\nway o' askin' for somethin' you want to get, or thankin' Him for what\r\nyou ha' got arready.  The first be called a prayer,--the t'other be a\r\nthanksgivin'.  Thear ain't much difference, as I could ever see; tho'\r\nI've heerd the ship's chaplain go through 'em both,--ay, scores o'\r\ntimes; but the one as we want now be the thanksgivin'; an' I know little\r\nWill'm here can go through it like a breeze.  Did you ever hear Will'm\r\npray, Snowy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nebba!  I tell ye, Massa Brace, a nebba heer anybody pray in de fashun\r\nyou 'peak 'bout.  Ob coas, I hab heer de nigga talk to da Fetish, de\r\nwhich I, tho' I be a nigga maseff, nebba belieb'd in.  Dis child no\r\nbelieb in anyting he no see, an' he see many ting he no belieb in.\"\r\n\r\nTo this frank confession of faith on the part of the Coromantee Ben made\r\nno rejoinder that might signify either assent or opposition.  His reply\r\nwas rather a continuation of the train of thought that had led to his\r\nlast interrogative.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Snowy, if you heerd the lad!  He do pray beautiful!  Most equal to\r\nthe parson, as we had aboard the frigate; an' he warn't slow at it,\r\neyther.  Do 'ee think, Will'm,\" continued the sailor, turning to the lad\r\nwith an inquiring look, \"do 'ee think ye can remember that prayer as is\r\nin the Church Sarvice, and which I've heerd the frigate chaplain go\r\nthrough,--specially after a storm,--as speaks about deliverin' us from\r\nall dangers by sea and by land?  You've heerd it at home in the church.\r\nD'ye think ye could gie it as?\"\r\n\r\n\"O,\" answered William, \"you mean the `Thanksgiving for Deliverance from\r\nour Enemies.'  Certainly I remember it.  How could I forget what I've\r\nheard so many Sundays in church, besides often on week-days at home?  O\r\nyes, Ben, I can repeat it, if you wish!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do, lad.  Gie it us, then.  It may do good.  At all events, we _owe_\r\nit, for what's been done to us.  So take a reef out o' your tongue, lad,\r\nan' fire away!\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the _bizarrerie_ of manner in which the request was\r\nmade, the boy-sailor hesitated not to comply with it; and turning\r\nhimself round upon his knees,--a movement imitated by all the others,--\r\nhe repeated that _thanksgiving_ of the Church Service, which, though\r\nwell-known, is fortunately only heard upon very unfrequent occasions.\r\n\r\nThe thanksgiving appeared an appropriate finale to the toils and dangers\r\nof the day; and after it was offered up, Snowball, William, and Lalee\r\nlay down to rest,--leaving Ben Brace to attend to the steering-oar, and\r\notherwise perform the duties of the dog-watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL SEES LAND.\r\n\r\nThe man-o'-war's-man kept watch during the long hours of the night.\r\nTrue to his trust, he attended to the steering-oar: and as the breeze\r\ncontinued to blow steadily in the same direction, the raft, under the\r\ndouble propulsion of the wind and the \"line current,\" made considerable\r\nway to the westward.\r\n\r\nA sort of filmy fog had arisen over the ocean, which hid the stars from\r\nsight.  This might have rendered it impossible for the steersman to keep\r\nhis course; but, under the belief that there was no change occurring in\r\nthe direction of the wind, Ben guided himself by that, and very\r\nproperly, as it afterwards proved.\r\n\r\nJust before daybreak, he was relieved by Snowball; who entered upon his\r\nwatch, at the same time taking his turn at the steering-oar.\r\n\r\nBen had not aroused the negro for this purpose; and he would have\r\ngenerously remained at his post until morning, had Snowball desired to\r\nprolong his slumbers.\r\n\r\nThe act of arousing himself was not altogether voluntary on the part of\r\nthe negro; though neither was it the doing of his comrade.  It was in\r\nconsequence of a physical feeling--a cold shivering caused by the damp\r\nsea-fog--that Snowball had been disturbed from his sleep; and which, on\r\nhis awaking, kept him for some minutes oscillating in a sort of ague,\r\nhis ivories \"dingling\" against each other with a continuous rattle that\r\nresembled the clattering of some loose bolt in a piece of machinery out\r\nof repair.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before Snowball could recover his exact equilibrium;\r\nfor, of all sorts of climate, that least endurable to the Coromantee\r\nnegro is a cold one.\r\n\r\nAfter repeated flopping his arms over his broad chest, and striking\r\ncrosswise, until the tips of his fingers almost met upon the spinal\r\ncolumn of his back, Snowball succeeded in resuscitating the circulation;\r\nand then, perceiving it was full time to take his turn at the helm, he\r\nproposed relieving the sailor.\r\n\r\nThis proposal was agreed to; Ben, before putting himself in a position\r\nfor repose, giving Snowball the necessary directions as to the course in\r\nwhich the _Catamaran_ was to be kept.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes after, the sailor was asleep; and the sea-cook was the\r\nonly one of the Catamarans who was conscious that the craft that carried\r\nthem was only a frail structure drifting in mid-ocean hundreds of miles\r\nfrom land.\r\n\r\nLittle William was, perhaps, dreaming of his English, and Lilly Lalee of\r\nher African, home; while the sailor, in all probability, was fancying\r\nhimself safely \"stowed\" in the forecastle of a British frigate, with all\r\nsail rightly set, and a couple of hundred jolly Jacks like himself\r\nstretched out in their \"bunks\" or swinging in their hammocks around him.\r\n\r\nDuring the first hour of his watch, Snowball did not embarrass his brain\r\nwith any other idea than simply to follow the instructions of the\r\nsailor, and keep the _Catamaran_ before the wind.\r\n\r\nThere had been something said about keeping a look-out, in the hope of\r\nespying a sail; but in the dense fog that surrounded them there would be\r\nno chance of seeing the biggest ship,--even should one be passing at an\r\nordinary cable's length from the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nSnowball, therefore, did not trouble himself to scan the sea on either\r\nside of their course; but for all that he kept the look-out enjoined on\r\nhim by the sailor,--that is, he _kept it with his ears_!\r\n\r\nThough a ship might not be seen, the voices of her crew or other sounds\r\noccurring aboard might be heard; for in this way the presence of a\r\nvessel is often proclaimed in a very dark night or when the sea is\r\nobscured by a fog.\r\n\r\nOftener, however, at such times, two ships will approach and recede from\r\none another, without either having been conscious of the proximity of\r\nthe other,--meeting in mid-ocean and gliding silently past, like two\r\ngiant spectres,--each bent on its own noiseless errand.\r\n\r\nDaybreak arrived without the black pilot having heard any sound, beyond\r\nthat of the breeze rustling against the sail of the _Catamaran_ or the\r\nhollow \"sough\" of the water as it surged against the empty casks lashed\r\nalong their sides.\r\n\r\nAs the day broke, however, and the upper edge of the sun's disk became\r\nvisible above the horizon,--the fog under the influence of his rays\r\ngrowing gradually but sensibly thinner,--a sight became disclosed to the\r\neyes of Snowball that caused the blood to course with lightning\r\nquickness through his veins; while his heart, beating delightfully\r\nwithin his capacious chest, bounded far above the region of his\r\ndiaphragm.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant he sprang to his feet, dropped the steering-oar, as\r\nif it had been a bar of red-hot iron; and, striding forward to the\r\nstarboard bow of the _Catamaran_ stood gazing outward upon the ocean!\r\n\r\nWhat could have caused this sudden commotion in both the mind and body\r\nof the Coromantee?  What spectacle could have thus startled him?\r\n\r\nIt was the sight of _land_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY SIX.\r\n\r\nIS IT LAND?\r\n\r\nA sight so unexpected, and yet so welcome, should have elicited from him\r\na vociferous announcement of the fact.\r\n\r\nIt did not.  On the contrary, he kept silent while stepping forward on\r\nthe deck, and for some time after, while he stood gazing over the bow.\r\n\r\nIt was the very unexpectedness of seeing land--combined with the\r\n_desirability_ of such a sight--that hindered him from proclaiming it to\r\nhis companions; and it was some time before he became convinced that his\r\nsenses were not deceiving him.\r\n\r\nThough endowed with only a very limited knowledge of nautical geography,\r\nthe negro knew a good deal about the lower latitudes of the Atlantic.\r\nMore than once had he made that dreaded middle passage,--once in\r\nfetters, and often afterwards assisting to carry others across in the\r\nsame unfeeling fashion.  He knew of no land anywhere near where they\r\nwere now supposed to be; had never seen or heard of any,--neither\r\nisland, rock, nor reef.  He knew of the Isle of Ascension, and the lone\r\nislet of Saint Paul's.  But neither of these could be near the track on\r\nwhich the _Catamaran_ was holding her course.  It could not be either.\r\n\r\nAnd yet what was it he saw? for, sure as eyes were eyes, there was an\r\nisland outlined upon the retina, so plainly perceptible, that his senses\r\ncould _not be deceiving him_!\r\n\r\nIt was after this conviction became fully established in his mind, that\r\nhe at length broke silence; and in a voice that woke his slumbering\r\ncompanions with a simultaneous start.\r\n\r\n\"Land 'o!\" vociferated Snowball.\r\n\r\n\"Land ho!\" echoed Ben Brace, springing to his feet, and rubbing the\r\nsleep out of his eyes, \"Land, you say, Snowy?  Impossible!  You must be\r\nmistaken, nigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Land?\" interrogated little William.  \"Whereaway, Snowball?\"\r\n\r\n\"Land?\" cried the Portuguese girl, comprehending that word of joyful\r\nsignification, though spoken in a language not her own.\r\n\r\n\"Whar away?\" inquired the sailor, as he scrambled over the planks of the\r\nraft, to get on the forward side of the sail, which hindered his field\r\nof view.\r\n\r\n\"Hya!\" replied Snowball.  \"Hya, Massa Brace, jess to la'bord, ober de\r\nla'bord bow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It do look like land,\" assented the sailor, directing his glance upon\r\nsomething of a strange appearance, low down upon the surface of the sea,\r\nand still but dimly discernible through the fog.  \"Shiver my timbers if\r\nit don't!  An island it be,--not a very big 'un, but for all that, it\r\nseem a island.\"\r\n\r\n\"My gollies! dar am people on it!  D'you see um, Massa Brace? movin'\r\n'bout all ober it I see 'um plain as de sun in de hebbens!  Scores o'\r\npeople a'gwine about back'ard an' forrads.  See yonner!\"\r\n\r\n\"Plain as the sun in the heavens,\" was not a very appropriate simile for\r\nSnowball to make use of at that moment; for the orb of day was still\r\ndarkly obscured by the fog; and for the same reason, the outlines of the\r\nisland,--or whatever they were taking for one,--could be traced only\r\nvery indistinctly.\r\n\r\nCertain it is, however, that Snowball, who had been gazing longer at the\r\nsupposed land, and had got his eyes more accustomed to the view, did see\r\nsome scores of figures moving about over it; and Ben Brace, with little\r\nWilliam as well, now that their attention was called to them, could\r\nperceive the same forms.\r\n\r\n\"Bless my stars!\" exclaimed the sailor, on making out that the figures\r\nwere in motion, \"thear be men on 't sure enough,--an' weemen, I should\r\nsay,--seein' as there's some o' 'em in whitish clothes.  Who and what\r\ncan they be?  Shiver my timbers if I can believe it, tho' I see it right\r\nafore my eyes!  I never heerd o' a island in this part of the Atlantic,\r\nan' I don't believe thear be one, 'ceptin' it's sprung up within the\r\nlast year or two.  What do you think, Snowy?  Be it a Flyin' Dutchman,\r\nor a rock, as if just showin' his snout above water, or a reg'lar-built\r\nisland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat 'ere am no Flyin' Dutchman,--leas'wise a hope um no' be.  No, Massa\r\nBrace, dis nigga wa right in de fuss speckelashun.  'Tarn a island,--a\r\nbit ob do real terrer firmer, as you soon see when we puts de\r\n_Cat'maran_ 'bout an' gits a leetle nearer to de place.\"\r\n\r\nThis hypothetic suggestion on the part of the Coromantee was also\r\nintended as a counsel; and, acting upon it, the sailor scrambled back\r\nover the raft, and seizing hold of the steering-oar, turned the\r\n_Catamaran's_ head straight in the direction of the newly-discovered\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe island,--if such it should prove to be,--was of no very great\r\nextent.  It appeared to run along the horizon a distance of something\r\nlike a hundred yards; but estimates formed in this fashion are often\r\ndeceptive,--more especially when a fog interferes, such as at that\r\nmoment hung over it.\r\n\r\nThe land appeared to be elevated several feet above the level of the\r\nsea,--at one end having a bold bluff-like termination, at the other\r\nshelving off in a gentle slope towards the water.\r\n\r\nIt was principally upon the more elevated portion that the figures were\r\nseen,--here standing in groups of three or four, and there moving about\r\nin twos, or singly.\r\n\r\nThey appeared to be of different sizes, and differently dressed: for,\r\neven through the film, it could be seen that their garments were of\r\nvarious cuts and colours.  Some were stalwart fellows, beside whom were\r\nothers that in comparison were mere pygmies.  These Snowball said were\r\nthe \"pickaninnies,\"--the children of the taller ones.\r\n\r\nThey were in different attitudes too.  Some standing erect, apparently\r\ncarrying long lance-like weapons over their shoulders; others similarly\r\narmed, in stooping positions; while not a few appeared to be actively\r\nengaged, handling huge pickaxes, with which they repeatedly struck\r\ndownwards, as if excavating the soil!\r\n\r\nIt is true that their manoeuvres were seen only indistinctly: and it was\r\nnot possible for the Catamarans to come to any certain understanding, as\r\nto what sort of work was going on upon the island.\r\n\r\nIt was still very doubtful whether what they saw was in reality an\r\nisland, or that the figures upon it were those of human beings.\r\nSnowball believed them to be so, and emphatically asserted his belief;\r\nbut Ben was slightly incredulous and undecided, notwithstanding that he\r\nhad several times \"shivered his timbers\" in confirmation of the fact.\r\n\r\nIt was not the possibility of the existence of an island that the sailor\r\ndisputed.  That was possible and probable enough.  At the time of which\r\nwe speak, new islands were constantly turning up in the ocean, where no\r\nland was supposed to exist; and even at the present hour, when one might\r\nsuppose that every inch of the sea has been sailed over, the discovery\r\nof rocks, shoals, and even unknown islands, is far from unfrequent.\r\n\r\nIt was not the island, therefore, that now puzzled the\r\nex-man-o'-war's-man, but the number of people appearing upon it.\r\n\r\nHad there been only a score, or a score and a half, he could have\r\nexplained the circumstance of its being inhabited; though the\r\nexplanation would not have been productive of pleasure either to himself\r\nor his companions.  In that case he would have believed the moving forms\r\nto be the shipwrecked crew of the _Pandora_ who on this ocean islet had\r\nfound a temporary resting-place; while the pickaxes, which were being\r\nfreely employed, would have indicated the sinking of wells in search\r\nafter fresh water.\r\n\r\nThe number of people on the island, however, with other circumstances\r\nobserved, at once contradicted the idea that it could be the crew of the\r\nshipwrecked slaver; and the certainty that it was _not_ these ruffians\r\nwhom they saw emboldened the Catamarans in their approach.\r\n\r\nIn spite of appearances, still was the sailor disposed to doubt the\r\nexistence of an island; or, at least, that the forms moving to and fro\r\nover its surface were those of human beings.\r\n\r\nNor could he be cured of his incredulity until the _Catamaran_,\r\napproaching still nearer to the shore of the doubtful islet, enabled him\r\nto see and distinguish beyond the possibility of doubt a flag floating\r\nfrom the top of its staff, which rose tall and tapering from the very\r\nhighest point of land which the place afforded!\r\n\r\nThe flag was of crimson cloth,--apparently a piece of bunting.  It\r\nfloated freely upon the breeze; which the filmy mist, though half\r\ndisclosing, could not altogether conceal.  The deep red colour was too\r\nscarce upon the ocean to be mistaken for the livery of any of its\r\ndenizens.  It could not be the tail-feathers of the tropic bird so\r\nprized by the chiefs of Polynesia; nor yet the scarlet pouch of the\r\nsea-hawk.\r\n\r\nIt could be nothing else than a \"bit o' buntin'.\"\r\n\r\nSo, at length, believed Ben Brace, and his belief, expressed in his own\r\npeculiar _patois_, produced conviction in the minds of all, that the\r\nobject extending along a hundred fathoms of the horizon, \"must be eyther\r\na rock, a reef, or a island; and the creeturs movin' over it must be\r\nmen, weemen, an' childer!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE KING OF THE CANNIBAL ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nThe emphatic declaration of the sailor,--that the dark disc before them\r\nmust be an island, and that the upright forms upon it were those of\r\nhuman beings,--dispelled all doubts upon the subject; and produced a\r\nfeeling of wild excitement in the minds of all three of his companions.\r\n\r\nSo strong was this feeling, that they could no longer control\r\nthemselves; but gave vent to their emotions in a simultaneous shout of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nActing prudently, they would have restrained that mirthful exhibition,\r\nfor although, for reasons already stated, the people appearing upon the\r\nisland could not be the wicked castaways who had composed the crew of\r\nthe _Pandora_, still might they be a tribe of savages equally wicked and\r\nmurderous.\r\n\r\nWho could tell that it was not a community of _Cannibals_.  No one\r\naboard the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nIt may seem singular that such a thought should have entered the mind of\r\nany of the individuals who occupied the raft.  But it did occur to some\r\nof them; and to one of the four in particular.  This was Ben Brace\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe sailor's experience, so far from destroying the credences of\r\nboyhood,--which included the existence of whole tribes of cannibals,--\r\nhad only strengthened his belief in such anthropophagi.\r\n\r\nMore than strengthened it: for it had been confirmed in every\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\nHe had been to the Fiji islands, where he had seen their\r\nking, Thakombau,--a true descendant of the lineage of\r\n\"Hokey-Pokey-Winkey-Wum,\"--with other dignitaries of this man-eating\r\nnation.  He had seen their huge caldron for cooking the flesh of men,--\r\ntheir pots and pans for stewing it,--their dishes upon which it was\r\nserved up,--the knives with which they were accustomed to carve it,--\r\ntheir larders stocked with human flesh, and redolent of human blood!\r\nNay, more; the English sailor had been an eye-witness of one of their\r\ngrand festivals; where the bodies of men and women, cooked in various\r\nstyles,--stewed, roasted, and boiled,--had been served out and partaken\r\nof by hundreds of Thakombau's courtiers; the sailor's own captain,--the\r\ncaptain of a British frigate,--ay, the commodore of a British\r\nsquadron,--with cannon sufficient to have blown the island of Viti Vau\r\nout of the water,--sitting alongside, apparently a tranquil and\r\ncontented spectator of the horrid ceremonial!\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to account for the behaviour of this Englishman, the\r\nHon. -- by name.  The only explanation of his conduct one can arrive at\r\nis, to believe that his weak mind was fast confined by the trammels of\r\nthat absurd, but often too convenient, theory of international\r\nnon-interference,--the most dangerous kind of red-tape that ever\r\ntethered the squeamish conscience of an official imbecile.\r\n\r\nHow different was the action of Wilkes,--that Yankee commander we are so\r\nfond of finding fault with!  He, too, paid a visit to the cannibal\r\nisland of Viti Vau; and while there, taught both its king and its people\r\na lesson by the fire of his forty-pounders that, if not altogether\r\neffective in extinguishing this national but unnatural custom, has\r\nterrified them in its practice to this very day.\r\n\r\nNon-interference, indeed!  International delicacy in the treatment of a\r\ntribe of cruel savages!  A nation of man-eaters,--forsooth, a nation!\r\nWhy not apply the laws of nationality to every band of brigands who\r\nchances to have conquered an independent existence?  Bah!  The world is\r\nfull of frivolous pretences,--drunk with the poison-cup of political\r\nhypocrisy.\r\n\r\nIt was not Ben Brace who thus reasoned, but his biographer.  Ben's\r\nreflections were of a strictly practical character His belief in\r\ncannibalism was complete; and as the craft to which he had so\r\ninvoluntarily attached himself drifted on towards the mysterious islet,\r\nhe was not without some misgivings as to the character of the people who\r\nmight inhabit it.\r\n\r\nFor this reason he would have approached its shores with greater\r\ncaution; and he was in the act of enforcing this upon his companions,\r\nwhen his intention was entirely frustrated by the joyous _huzza_ uttered\r\nby Snowball; echoed by little William; and chorussed by the childish,\r\nfeminine voice of Lilly Lalee.\r\n\r\nThe sailor's caution would have come too late,--even had it been\r\nnecessary to the safety of the _Catamaran's_ crew.  Fortunately it was\r\nnot: for that imprudent shout produced an effect which at once changed\r\nthe current of the thoughts, not only of Ben Brace, but of those who had\r\ngiven utterance to it.\r\n\r\nTheir united voices, pealing across the tranquil bosom of the deep,\r\ncaused a sudden change in the appearance of the island; or rather among\r\nthe people who inhabited it.  If human beings, they must be of a strange\r\nrace,--very strange indeed,--to have been furnished with wings!  How\r\notherwise could they have forsaken their footing on _terra firma_,--if\r\nthe island was such,--and soared upward into the air, which one and all\r\nof them did, on hearing that shout from the _Catamaran_?\r\n\r\nThere was not much speculation on this point on the part of the\r\n_Catamaran's_ crew.  Whatever doubts may have been engendered as to the\r\nnature of the island, there could be no longer any about the character\r\nof its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\"Dey am birds!\" suggested the Coromantee; \"nuffin more and nuffin less\r\ndan birds!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Snowy,\" assented the sailor.  \"They be birds; and all the\r\nbetter they be so.  Yes; they're birds, for sartin.  I can tell the cut\r\no' some o' their jibs.  I see frigates, an' a man-o'-war's-man, an'\r\nboobies among 'em; and I reckon Old Mother Carey has a brood o' her\r\nchickens there.  They be all sizes, as ye see.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no more a matter of conjecture, as to what kind of creatures\r\ninhabited the island.  The forms that had been mystifying the crew of\r\nthe _Catamaran_, though of the biped class, were no longer to be\r\nregarded as human beings, or even creatures of the earth.  They had\r\ndeclared themselves denizens of the air; and, startled by the shouts\r\nthat had reached them,--to them, no doubt, sounds strange, and never\r\nbefore heard,--they had sought security in an element into which there\r\nwas no fear of being followed by their enemies, either of the earth or\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nVERY LIKE A WHALE.\r\n\r\nThough the birds by their flight had dissolved one half of the\r\nspeculative theory which the crew of the _Catamaran_ had constructed,\r\nthe other half still held good.  The island was still there, before\r\ntheir eyes; though completely divested of its inhabitants,--whose sudden\r\neviction had cost only a single shout!\r\n\r\nThe flag was still waving over it; though, to all appearance, there was\r\nnot a creature on shore that might feel pride in saluting that solitary\r\nstandard!\r\n\r\nThere could be no one; else why should the birds have tarried so long\r\nundisturbed, to be scared at last by the mere sound of human voices?\r\n\r\nSince there was nobody on the island, there was no need to observe\r\nfurther caution in approaching it,--except so far as regarded the\r\nconduct of their craft; and in the belief that they were about to set\r\nfoot upon the shores of a desert isle, the sailor and Snowball, with\r\nlittle William assisting them, now went to work with the oars and\r\nhastened their approach to the land.\r\n\r\nPartly impelled by the breeze, and partly by the strength of the rowers,\r\nthe _Catamaran_ moved, briskly through the water; and, before many\r\nminutes had elapsed, the craft was within a few hundred fathoms of the\r\nmysterious island, and still gliding nearer to it.  This proximity,--\r\nalong with the fact that the morning mist had meanwhile been gradually\r\nbecoming dispelled by the rays of the rising sun,--enabled her crew to\r\nobtain a clearer view of the object before them; and Ben Brace,\r\nsuspending his exertions at the oar, once more slewed himself round to\r\nhave a fresh look at the supposed _land_.\r\n\r\n\"Land!\" he exclaimed, as soon as his eyes again rested upon it.  \"A\r\nisland, indeed!  Shiver my timbers if 't be a island after all!  That be\r\nno land,--ne'er a bit o't.  It look like a rock, too; but there be\r\nsomething else it look liker; an' that be a _whale_.  'Tis wery like a\r\nwhale!\"\r\n\r\n\"Berry,--berry like a whale!\" echoed Snowball, not too well satisfied at\r\ndiscovering the resemblance.\r\n\r\n\"It _be_ a whale!\" pronounced the sailor, in a tone of emphatic\r\nconfidence,--\"a whale, an' nothin' else.  Ay,\" he continued speaking, as\r\nif some new light had broken upon him, \"I see it all now.  It be one o'\r\nthe great _spermaceti_ whales.  I wonder I didn't think o't afore.  It's\r\nbeen killed by some whaling-vessel; and the flag you see on its back's\r\nneyther more nor less than one o' their _whifts_.  They've stuck it\r\nthere, so as they might be able to find the sparmacety when they come\r\nback.  Marcy heaven!  I hope they _will_ come back.\"\r\n\r\nAs Ben finished this explanatory harangue, he started into an erect\r\nattitude, and placed himself on the highest part of the _Catamaran's_\r\ndeck,--his eyes no longer bent upon the whale, but, with greedy glances,\r\nsweeping the sea around it.\r\n\r\nThe object of this renewed reconnoissance may be understood from the\r\nwords to which he had given utterance,--the hope expressed at the\r\ntermination of his speech.  The whale must have been killed, as he had\r\nsaid.  He was looking for the _whaler_.\r\n\r\nFor full ten minutes he continued his optical search over the sea,--\r\nuntil not a fathom of the surface had escaped his scrutiny.\r\n\r\nAt first his glances had expressed almost a confident hope; and,\r\nobserving them, the others became excited to a high degree of joy.\r\n\r\nGradually, however, the old shadow returned over the sailor's\r\ncountenance, and was instantly transferred to the faces of his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nThe sea,--as far as his eye could command a view of it,--showed neither\r\nsail, nor any other object.  Its shining surface was absolutely without\r\na speck.\r\n\r\nWith a disappointed air, the captain of the _Catamaran_ descended from\r\nhis post of observation; and once more turned his attention to the dead\r\n_cachalot_ from which they were now separated by less than a hundred\r\nfathoms,--a distance that was constantly decreasing, as the raft, under\r\nsail, continued to drift nearer.\r\n\r\nThe body of the whale did not appear anything like as large as when\r\nfirst seen.  The mist was no longer producing its magnifying effect upon\r\nthe vision of our adventurers; but although the carcass of the\r\n_cachalot_ could no more have been mistaken for an island, still was it\r\nan object of enormous dimensions; and might easily have passed for a\r\ngreat black rock standing several fathoms above the surface of the sea.\r\nIt was over twenty yards in length; and, seen sideways from the raft, of\r\ncourse appeared much longer.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes after, they were close up to the dead whale; and, the\r\nsail being lowered, the raft was brought to.  Ben threw a rope around\r\none of the pectoral fins; and, after making it fast, the _Catamaran_ lay\r\nmoored alongside the _cachalot_, like some diminutive tender attached to\r\na huge ship of war!  There were several reasons why Ben Brace should\r\nmount up to the summit of that mountain of whalebone and blubber; and,\r\nas soon as the raft had been safely secured, he essayed the ascent.\r\n\r\nIt was not such a trifling feat,--this climbing upon the carcass of the\r\ndead whale.  Nor was it to be done without danger.  The slippery\r\nepidermis of the huge leviathan,--lubricated as it was with that\r\nunctuous fluid which the skin of the sperm-whale is known to secrete,--\r\nrendered footing upon it extremely insecure.\r\n\r\nIt might be fancied no great matter for a swimmer like Ben Braco to\r\nslide off: since a fall of a few feet into the water could not cause him\r\nany great bodily hurt.  But when the individual forming this fancy has\r\nbeen told that there was something like a score of sharks prowling\r\naround the carcass, he will obtain a more definite idea of the danger to\r\nwhich such a fall would have submitted the adventurous seaman.\r\n\r\nBen Brace was the last man to be cowed by a trifling danger, or even one\r\nof magnitude; and partly by Snowball's assistance, and using the\r\npectoral flipper to which the raft was attached as a stirrup, he\r\nsucceeded in mounting upon the back of the defunct monster of the deep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had steadied himself in his new position, a piece of rope\r\nwas thrown up to him,--by which Snowball was himself hoisted to the\r\nshoulders of the _cachalot_; and then the two seamen proceeded towards\r\nthe tail,--or, as the sailor pronounced it, the \"starn\" of this peculiar\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nA little aft of \"midships\" a pyramidal lump of fatty substance projected\r\nseveral feet above the line of the vertebras.  It was the spurious or\r\nrudimentary dorsal fin, with which the sperm-whale is provided.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at this protuberance,--which chanced to be the highest point\r\non the carcass where the flag was elevated on its slender shaft,--both\r\ncame to a halt; and there stood together, gazing around them over the\r\nglittering surface of the sunlit sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY NINE.\r\n\r\nABOARD THE BODY OF A WHALE.\r\n\r\nThe object of their united reconnoissance was the same which, but a few\r\nmoments before, had occupied the attention of the sailor.  They were\r\nstanding on the dead body of a whale that had been killed by harpoons.\r\nWhere were the people who had harpooned it?\r\n\r\nAfter scanning the horizon with the same careful scrutiny as before, the\r\nsailor once more turned his attention to the huge leviathan, on whose\r\nback they were borne.\r\n\r\nSeveral objects not before seen now attracted the attention of himself\r\nand companion.  The tall flag, known among whalers by the name of\r\n\"whift,\" was not the only evidence of the manner in which the _cachalot_\r\nhad met its death.  Two large harpoons were seen sticking out of its\r\nside, their iron arrows buried up to the socket in its blubber; while\r\nfrom the thick wooden shanks, protruding beyond the skin, were lines\r\nextending into the water, at the ends of which were large blocks of wood\r\nfloating like buoys upon the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\nBen identified the latter as the \"drogues,\" that form part of the\r\nequipment of a regular whale-ship.  He knew them well, and their use.\r\nBefore becoming a man-o'-war's-man, he had handled the harpoon; and was\r\nperfectly _au fait_ to all connected with the calling of a whaler.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" resumed he, on recognising the implements of his _ci-devant_\r\nprofession, \"it ha' been jest as I said.  A whaler 'a been over this\r\nground, and killed the spermacety.  Maybe I'm wrong about that,\" he\r\nadded, after reflecting a short while.  \"I may be wrong about the ship\r\nbeing over this very ground.  I don't like the look o' them drogues.\"\r\n\r\n\"De drogue?\" inquired the Coromantee.  \"Dem block o' wood dat am\r\ndriffin' about?  Wha' for you no like dem, Massa Brace?\"\r\n\r\n\"But for their bein' thear I could say for sartin a ship had been here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must a' been!\" asserted Snowball.  \"If no', how you count for de\r\npresence ob de flag and de hapoons?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" answered the sailor, with something like a sigh; \"they kud a' got\r\nthear, without the men as throwed 'em bein' anywhere near this.  You\r\nknow nothin' o' whalin', Snowy.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech put Snowball in a quandary.\r\n\r\n\"You see, nigger,\" continued the sailor, \"the presence o' them drogues\r\nindercates that the whale warn't dead when the boats left her.\"  (The\r\n_ci-devant_ whaler followed the fashion of his former associates, in\r\nspeaking of the whale, among whom the epicene gender of the animal is\r\nalways feminine.) \"She must a' been still alive,\" continued he, \"and the\r\ndrogues were put thear to hinder her from makin' much way through the\r\nwater.  In coorse there must a' been a school o' the spermacetys; and\r\nthe crew o' the whaler didn't want to lose time with this 'un, which\r\nthey had wounded.  For that reason they have struck her with this pair\r\no' drogued harpoons; and stuck this whift into her back.  On fust seein'\r\nthat, I war inclined to think different.  You see the whift be stickin'\r\na'most straight up, an' how could that a' been done by them in the\r\nboats?  If the whale hadn't a' been dead, nobody would a' dared to a\r\nclombed on to her an' fix the flag that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right dar,\" interrupted Snowball.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" rejoined the sailor, \"I ain't.  I thought I war; but I war wrong,\r\nas you be now, Snowy.  You see the flag-spear ain't straight into the\r\nback o' the anymal.  It's to one side, though it now stand nearly on\r\ntop; because the body o' the whale be canted over a bit.  A first-rate\r\n`_heads-man_' o' a whale-boat could easily a' throwed it that way from\r\nthe bottom o' his boat, and that's the way it ha' been done.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spose 'im hab been jest dat way,\" assented Snowball.  \"But wha' matter\r\n'bout dat?  De whale have been kill all de same.\"\r\n\r\n\"What matter?  Everything do it matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Splain, Massa Brace!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ye see, nigger, that if the spermacety had been dispatched while\r\nthe boats were about it, it would prove that the whale-ship must a' been\r\nhere while they were a killin' the creature; an' that would go far to\r\nprove that she couldn't be a great ways off now.\"\r\n\r\n\"So dat wud,--so im wud, fo' sa'tin sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Snowy, as the case stands, thear be no sartinty where the whaler\r\nbe at this time.  The anymal, after being drogued, may a' sweemed many a\r\nmile from the place where she war first harpooned.  I've knowed 'em to\r\ngo a score o' knots afore they pulled up; an' this bein' a' old bull,--\r\none o' the biggest spermacetys I ever see,--she must a sweemed to the\r\nfull o' that distance afore givin' in.  If that's been so, thear ain't\r\nmuch chance o' eyther her or we bein' overhauled by the whaler.\"\r\n\r\nAs the sailor ceased speaking he once more directed his glance over the\r\nocean; which, after another minute and careful scrutiny of the horizon,\r\nfell back upon the body of the whale, with the same expression of\r\ndisappointment that before had been observable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY.\r\n\r\nA CURIOUS CUISINE.\r\n\r\nDuring all that day, the sailor and the ex-cook of the _Pandora_ kept\r\nwatch from the _summit_ of the dead _cachalot_.\r\n\r\nIt was not altogether for this purpose they remained there,--since the\r\nmast of the _Catamaran_ would have given them an observatory of equal\r\nand even greater elevation.\r\n\r\nThere were several reasons why they did not cast off from the carcass,\r\nand continue their westward course: the most important being the hope\r\nthat the destroyers of the whale might return to take possession of the\r\nvaluable prize which they had left behind them.\r\n\r\nThere was, moreover, an undefined feeling of security in lying alongside\r\nthe leviathan,--almost as great as they might have felt if anchored near\r\nthe beach of an actual island,--and this had some influence in\r\nprotracting their stay.\r\n\r\nBut there was yet another motive which would of itself have caused them\r\nto remain at their present moorings for a considerable period of time.\r\n\r\nDuring the intervals of their protracted vigil, they had not been\r\ninattentive to the objects immediately around them: and the carcass of\r\nthe whale had come in for a share of their consideration.  A\r\nconsultation had been held upon it, which had resulted in a\r\ndetermination not to leave the leviathan until they had rendered its\r\nremains, or at least a portion of them, useful for some future end.\r\n\r\nThe old whaleman knew that under that dark epidermis over which, for two\r\ndays, they had been recklessly treading, there were many valuable\r\nsubstances that might be made available to their use and comfort, on\r\nboard the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was the \"blubber,\" which, if boiled or \"tried,\" would, from\r\nthe body of an old bull like that, yield at the very least, a hundred\r\nbarrels of oil.\r\n\r\nThis they cared nothing about: since they had neither the pots to boil,\r\nthe casks to hold, nor the craft to carry it,--even if rendered into oil\r\nfor the market.\r\n\r\nBut Ben knew that within the skull of the _cachalot_ there was a deposit\r\nof pure sperm, that needed no preparation, which would be found of\r\nservice to them in a way they had already thought of.\r\n\r\nThis sperm could be reached by simply removing the \"junk\" which forms\r\nthe exterior portion of a _cachalot's_ huge snout, and sinking a shaft\r\ninto the skull.  Here would, or should, be found a cavity filled with a\r\ndelicate cellular tissue, containing ten or a dozen large barrels full\r\nof the purest spermaceti.\r\n\r\nThey did not stand in need of anything like this quantity.  A couple of\r\ncasks would suffice for their need; and these they desired to obtain for\r\nthat want which had suggested itself to both Snowball and the sailor.\r\nThey had been long suffering from the absence of fuel,--not wherewith to\r\nwarm themselves,--but as a means of enabling them to cook their food.\r\nThey need suffer no longer.  With the spermaceti to be extracted from\r\nthe \"case\" of the _cachalot_, they could lay in a stock that would last\r\nthem for many a day.  They had their six casks,--five of them still\r\nempty.  By using a couple of them to contain the oil, the raft would\r\nstill be sufficiently buoyant to carry all hands, and not a bit less\r\nworthy of the sea.\r\n\r\nBoth of these brave men had observed the repugnance with which Lilly\r\nLalee partook of their raw repasts.  Nothing but hunger enabled her to\r\neat what they could set before her.  It had touched the feelings of\r\nboth; and rendered them desirous of providing her with some kind of food\r\nmore congenial to the delicate palate of the child.\r\n\r\nLong before they had any intention of abandoning the dead body of the\r\nwhale,--in fact shortly after taking possession of it,--Ben Brace,\r\nassisted by Snowball and little William,--the latter having also mounted\r\nupon the monster's back,--cut open the great cavity of the \"case\" with\r\nthe axe; and then inserting a large tin pot,--which had turned up in the\r\nsailor's sea-kit,--drew it put again full of liquid spermaceti.\r\n\r\nThis was carried down to the deck of the _Catamaran_ when the process of\r\nmaking a fire was instantly proceeded with.\r\n\r\nBy means of some untwisted strands of tarry rope, ingeniously inserted\r\ninto the oil, the pot was converted into a sort of open lamp,--which\r\nonly required to be kindled into a flame.\r\n\r\nBut Ben Brace had not been smoking a pipe for a period of nearly thirty\r\nyears, without being provided with the means of lighting it.  In the\r\nsame depository from which the tin pot had been obtained was found the\r\nproper implements for striking a light,--flint, steel, and tinder,--and,\r\nas the latter, within the water-tight compartment of the\r\nman-o'-war's-man's chest, having been preserved perfectly dry, there was\r\nno difficulty in setting fire to the oil.\r\n\r\nIt was soon seen burning up over the rim of the pot with a bright clear\r\nflame; and a large flake of the dried fish being held over the blaze, in\r\na very short space of time became done to a turn.\r\n\r\nThis furnished all of them with a meal much more palatable than any they\r\nhad eaten since they had been forced to flee from the decks of the\r\nburning _Pandora_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY ONE.\r\n\r\nAN ASSEMBLY OF SHARKS.\r\n\r\nAs the spermaceti in the pot still continued to blaze up,--the wick not\r\nyet having burnt out,--it occurred to Snowball to continue his culinary\r\noperations, and broil a sufficient quantity of the dead fish to serve\r\nfor supper.  The ex-cook, unlike most others of his calling, did not\r\nlike to see his fuel idly wasted: and therefore, in obedience to the\r\nthought that had suggested itself, he brought forth another flake of\r\nshark-flesh, and submitted to the flames, as before.\r\n\r\nWhile observing him in the performance of this provident task, a capital\r\nidea also occurred to Ben Brace.  Since it was possible thus to cook\r\ntheir supper in advance, why not also their breakfast for the following\r\nmorning, then dinner for the day, their supper of to-morrow night,--in\r\nshort, all the raw provisions which they had on their hands?  By doing\r\nthis, not only would a fire be no longer necessary, but the fish so\r\ncooked,--or even thoroughly dried in the blaze and smoke,--would be\r\nlikely to keep better.  In fact, fish thus preserved,--as is often done\r\nwith herrings, ling, codfish, mackerel, and haddock,--will remain good\r\nfor months without suffering the slightest taint of decomposition.  It\r\nwas an excellent idea; and, Ben having communicated it to the others, it\r\nwas at once determined that it should be carried out.\r\n\r\nThere was no fear of their running short in the staple article of fuel.\r\nBen assured them that the \"case\" of a _cachalot_ of the largest size,--\r\nsuch as the one beside them,--often contained five hundred gallons of\r\nthe liquid spermaceti!  Besides, there was the enormous quantity of junk\r\nand blubber,--whole mountains of it,--both of which could be rendered\r\ninto oil by a process which the whalers term \"trying.\"  Other\r\ninflammable substances, too, are found in the carcass of the\r\nsperm-whale: so that, in the article of fuel, the crew of the\r\n_Catamaran_ had been unexpectedly furnished with a stock by which they\r\nmight keep up a blazing fire for the whole of a twelvemonth.\r\n\r\nIt was no longer any scarcity of fuel that could hinder them from\r\ncooking on a large scale, but a scantiness of the provisions to be\r\ncooked; and they were now greatly troubled at the thought of their\r\nlarder having got so low.\r\n\r\nWhile Ben Brace and Snowball stood pondering upon this, and mutually\r\nmurmuring their regrets, a thought suddenly came into the mind of the\r\nsailor which was calculated to give comfort to all.\r\n\r\n\"As for the provisions in our locker,\" said he, \"we can easily 'plenish\r\nthem, such as they be.  Look there, nigger.  There be enough raw meat to\r\nkeep ye a' cookin' till your wool grows white.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor, as he said this, simply nodded toward the sea.\r\n\r\nIt needed no further pointing out to understand what he meant by the\r\nphrase \"raw meat.\"  Scores of sharks,--both of the blue and white\r\nspecies,--attended by their pilots and suckers, were swimming around the\r\ncarcass of the _cachalot_.  The sea seemed alive with them.  Scarce a\r\nsquare rod, within a circle of several hundred fathoms' circumference,\r\nthat did not exhibit their stiff, wicked-looking dorsal fins cutting\r\nsharply above the surface.\r\n\r\nOf course the presence of the dead whale accounted for this unusual\r\nconcourse of the tyrants of the deep.  Not that they had any intention\r\nof directing their attack upon it: for, from the peculiar conformation\r\nof his mouth, the shark is incapable of feeding upon the carcass of a\r\nlarge whale.  But having, no doubt, accompanied the chase at the time\r\nthe _cachalot_ had been harpooned, they were now staying by a dead body,\r\nfrom an instinct that told them its destroyers would return, and supply\r\nthem with its flesh in convenient morsels,--while occupied in _flensing_\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Ugh!\" exclaimed the sailor; \"they look hungry enough to bite at any\r\nbait we may throw out to them.  We won't have much trouble in catchin'\r\nas many o' 'em as we want.\"\r\n\r\n\"A doan b'lieve, Massa Brace, we hab got nebba such a ting as a\r\nshark-hook 'board de _Cat'maran_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't make yourself uneasy 'bout that,\" rejoined the sailor, in a\r\nconfident tone.  \"Shark-hook be blowed!  I see somethin' up yonder worth\r\na score o' shark-hooks.  The brutes be as tame as turtles turned on\r\ntheir backs.  They're always so about a dead spermacety.  Wi' one o'\r\nthem ere tools as be stickin' in the side o' the old bull, if I don't\r\npull a few o' them out o' water, I never handled a harpoon, that's all.\r\nYe may stop your cookin' Snowy, an' go help me.  When we've got a few\r\nsharks catched an' cut up, then you can go at it again on a more\r\n'stensive scale.  Come along, my hearty!\"\r\n\r\nAs Ben terminated his speech, he strode across the deck of the raft, and\r\ncommenced clambering up on the carcass.\r\n\r\nSnowball, who perceived the wisdom of his old comrade's design, let go\r\nthe flake of fish he had been holding in the blaze; and, parting from\r\nthe pot, once more followed the sailor up the steep side of the\r\n_cachalot_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY TWO.\r\n\r\nA DANGEROUS EQUILIBRIUM.\r\n\r\nBen had taken along with him the axe; and, proceeding towards one of the\r\nharpoons,--still buried in the body of the whale,--he commenced cutting\r\nit out.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments a deep cavity was hewn out around the shank of the\r\nharpoon; which was further deepened, until the barbed blade was wellnigh\r\nlaid bare.  Snowball, impatiently seizing the stout wooden shaft, gave\r\nit a herculean pluck, that completely detached the arrow from the soft\r\nblubber in which it had been imbedded.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Snowball, he had not well calculated the strength\r\nrequired for clearing that harpoon.  Having already made several\r\nfruitless attempts to extract it, he did not expect it to draw out so\r\neasily; and, in consequence of his making an over-effort, his balance\r\nbecame deranged; his feet, ill-planted upon the slippery skin, flew\r\nsimultaneously from beneath him; and he came down upon the side of the\r\nleviathan with a loud \"slap,\"--similar to what might have been heard had\r\nhe fallen upon half-thawed ice.\r\n\r\nUnpleasant as this mishap may have been, it was not the worst that might\r\nhave befallen him on that occasion.  Nor was it the fall itself that\r\ncaused him to \"sing out\" at the top of his voice, and in accents\r\nbetokening a terrible alarm.\r\n\r\nWhat produced this manifestation was a peril of far more fearful kind,\r\nwhich at the moment menaced him.\r\n\r\nThe spot where the harpoon had been sticking was in the side of the\r\n_cachalot_, and, as the carcass lay, a broad space around the weapon\r\npresented an inclined plane, sloping abruptly towards the water.\r\nLubricated as it was with the secreted oil of the animal, it was smooth\r\nas glass.  Upon this slope Snowball had been standing; and upon it had\r\nhe fallen.\r\n\r\nBut the impetus of the fall not only hindered him from lying where he\r\nhad gone down, but also from being able to get up again; and, instead of\r\ndoing either one or the other, he commenced sliding down the slippery\r\nsurface of the leviathan's body, where it shelved towards the water.\r\n\r\nGood heavens! what was to become of him?  A score of sharks were just\r\nbelow,--waiting for him with hungry jaws, and eyes glancing greedily\r\nupward.  Seeing the two men mounted upon the carcass of the whale, and\r\none wielding an axe, they had gathered upon that side,--in the belief\r\nthat the _flensing_ was about to begin!\r\n\r\nIt was a slight circumstance that saved the sea-cook from being eaten\r\nup,--not only raw, but alive.  Simply the circumstance of his having\r\nheld on to the harpoon.  Had he dropped that weapon on falling, it would\r\nnever have been grasped by him again.  Fortunately, he had the presence\r\nof mind to hold on to it; or perhaps the tenacity was merely mechanical.\r\nWhatever may have been the reason, he _did_ hold on.  Fortunately,\r\nalso, he was gliding down on the side _opposite_ to that on which\r\nfloated the \"drogue.\"\r\n\r\nThese two circumstances saved him.\r\n\r\nWhen about half-way to the water,--and still sliding rapidly\r\ndownwards,--his progress was suddenly arrested, or rather impeded,--for\r\nhe was not altogether brought to a stop,--by a circumstance as\r\nunexpected as it was fortunate.  That was the tightening of the line\r\nattached to the handle of the harpoon.  He had slidden to the end of his\r\ntether,--the other end of which was fast to the drogue drifting about in\r\nthe sea, as already said, on the opposite side of the carcass.\r\n\r\nHeavy as was the piece of wood,--and offering, as it did, a considerable\r\namount of resistance in being dragged through the water,--it would not\r\nhave been sufficient to sustain the huge body of the Coromantee.  It\r\nonly checked the rapidity of his descent; and in the end he would have\r\ngone down into the sea,--and shortly after into the stomachs of,\r\nperhaps, half a score of sharks,--but for the opportune interference of\r\nthe ex-man-o'-war's-man; who, just in the nick of time,--at the very\r\nmoment when Snowball's toes were within six inches of the water's edge,\r\ncaught hold of the cord and arrested his farther descent.\r\n\r\nBut although the sailor had been able to accomplish this much, and was\r\nalso able to keep Snowball from slipping farther down, he soon\r\ndiscovered that he was unable to pull him up again.  It was just as much\r\nas his strength was equal to,--even when supplemented by the weight of\r\nthe drogue,--to keep the sea-cook in the place where he had succeeded in\r\nchecking him.  There hung Snowball in suspense,--holding on to the\r\nslippery skin of the _cachalot_, literally \"with tooth and toe-nail.\"\r\n\r\nSnowball saw that his position was perilous,--more than that: it was\r\nfrightful.  He could hear noises beneath him,--the rushing of the sharks\r\nthrough the water.  He glanced apprehensively below.  He could see their\r\nblack triangular fins, and note the lurid gleaming of their eyeballs, as\r\nthey rolled in their sunken sockets.  It was a sight to terrify the\r\nstoutest heart; and that of Snowball did not escape being terrified.\r\n\r\n\"Hole on, Massa Brace!\" he instinctively shouted.  \"Hole on, for de lub\r\no' God!  Doan't leab me slip an inch, or dese dam brute sure cotch hold\r\nob me!  Fo' de lub o' de great Gorramity, hole on!\"\r\n\r\nBen needed not the stimulus of this pathetic appeal.  He was holding on\r\nto the utmost of his strength.  He could not have added another pound to\r\nthe pull.  He dared not even renew either his attitude, or the grip he\r\nhad upon the rope.  The slightest movement he might make would endanger\r\nthe life of his black-skinned comrade.\r\n\r\nA slackening of the cord, even to the extent of twelve inches, would\r\nhave been fatal to the feet of Snowball--already within six of the\r\nsurface of the water and the snouts of the sharks!\r\n\r\nPerhaps never in all his checkered career had the life of the negro been\r\nsuspended in such dangerous balance.  The slightest circumstance would\r\nhave disturbed the equilibrium,--an ounce would have turned the scale,--\r\nand delivered him into the jaws of death.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to conjecture what would ultimately have been\r\nthe end of this perilous adventure, had the sailor and sea-cook been\r\npermitted to terminate it between themselves.  The strength of the\r\nformer was each instant decreasing; while the weight of the latter,--now\r\nmore feebly clinging to the slippery epidermis of the whale,--was in\r\nlike proportion becoming greater.\r\n\r\nWith nothing to intervene, the result might be easily guessed.  In\r\nfigurative parlance Snowball must have \"gone overboard.\"\r\n\r\nBut his time was not yet come; and his comrade knew this, when a pair of\r\nhands,--small, but strong ones,--were seen grasping the cord, alongside\r\nof his own.  They were the hands of Little Will'm!\r\n\r\nAt the earliest moment, after Snowball had slipped and fallen, the lad\r\nhad perceived his peril; and \"swarming\" up by the flipper of the whale,\r\nhad hurried to the assistance of Ben, laying hold of the rope,--not one\r\nsecond too soon.\r\n\r\nIt was soon enough, however, to save the suspended Coromantee; whose\r\nbody, now yielding to the united strength of the two, was drawn up the\r\nslippery slope,--slowly, but surely,--until it rested upon the broad\r\nhorizontal space around the summit of that mountain of bones and\r\nblubber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY THREE.\r\n\r\nA HARPOON WELL HANDLED.\r\n\r\nIt was some time before either his breath or the tranquillity of his\r\nspirits was restored to the Coromantee.\r\n\r\nThe sailor was equally suffering from the loss of the former; and both\r\nremained for a good many minutes without taking any further steps\r\ntowards the accomplishment of the design which had brought them on the\r\nback of the whale.\r\n\r\nAs soon, however, as Snowball could find wind enough for a few words,\r\nthey were uttered in a tone of gratitude,--first to Ben, who had\r\nhindered him from sinking down into something worse than a watery grave;\r\nand then to little William, who had aided in raising him up from it.\r\n\r\nBen less regarded the old comrade whom he had rescued than the young one\r\nwho had been instrumental in aiding him.\r\n\r\nHe stood gazing upon the youth with eyes that expressed a lively\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe promptitude and prowess which his _protege_ had exhibited in the\r\naffair was to him a source of the greatest gratification.\r\n\r\nMany a boy old as he,--ay, older, thought Ben Brace,--instead of having\r\nthe sense shown by the lad in promptly running to the rescue, would have\r\nremained upon the raft in mute surprise; or, at the best, have evinced\r\nhis sympathy by a series of unserviceable shouts, or a continued and\r\nidle screaming.\r\n\r\nBen did not wish to spoil his _protege_ by any spoken formula of praise,\r\nand therefore he said nothing: though, from his glances directed towards\r\nlittle William, it was easy to see that the bosom of the brave tar was\r\nswelling with a fond pride in the youth, for whom he had long felt an\r\naffection almost equalling that of a father.\r\n\r\nAfter indulging a short while in the mutual congratulations that\r\nnaturally follow such a crisis of danger, all three proceeded to the\r\nexecution of the duty so unexpectedly interrupted.\r\n\r\nWilliam had succeeded Snowball in that simple culinary operation which\r\nthe latter, commanded by his captain, had so suddenly relinquished.\r\n\r\nThe lad now returned to the raft, partly to complete the process of\r\nbroiling the fish; but perhaps with a greater desire to tranquillise the\r\nfears of Lilly Lalee,--who, ignorant of the exact upshot of what had\r\ntranspired, was yet in a state of unpleasant agitation.\r\n\r\nBen only waited for the return of his breath; and as soon as that was\r\nfairly restored to him, he once more set about the design that had\r\ncaused him for the second time to climb upon the back of the _cachalot_.\r\n\r\nTaking the harpoon from the hands of the Coromantee,--who still kept\r\nclutching it, as if there was danger in letting it go,--the sailor\r\nproceeded to draw up the drogue.  Assisted by Snowball, he soon raised\r\nit out of the water, and hoisted it to the horizontal platform, on which\r\nthey had placed themselves.\r\n\r\nHe did not want the block of wood just then,--only the line tied to it;\r\nand this having been detached, the drogue was left lying upon the\r\ncarcass.\r\n\r\nArmed with the harpoon, the _ci-devant_ whaleman now took a survey,--not\r\nof the land, but of the sea around him.\r\n\r\nThere was an assemblage of sharks close in to the body of the whale,--at\r\nthe spot where they had so lately threatened Snowball.\r\n\r\nSome of them had since scattered away, with a full consciousness of\r\ntheir disappointment; but the greater number had stayed, as if\r\nunsatisfied, or expecting that the banquet that had been so near their\r\nnoses might be brought back to them.\r\n\r\nBen's purpose was to harpoon some half-dozen of these ill-featured\r\ndenizens of the deep, and with their flesh replenish the stores of the\r\n_Catamaran_; for repulsive as the brutes may appear to the eye, and\r\nrepugnant to the thoughts, they nevertheless,--that is, certain species\r\nof them, and certain parts of these species,--afford excellent food:\r\nsuch as an epicure,--to say nothing of a man half-famished,--may eat\r\nwith sufficient relish.\r\n\r\nThere could have been no difficulty in destroying any of the sharks so\r\nlate threatening to swallow Snowball, had the harpooner been able to get\r\nwithin striking distance of them.  But the slippery skin of the whale\r\ndeterred the sailor from trusting himself on that dangerous incline; and\r\nhe determined, therefore, to try elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn the direction of the _cachalot's_ tail the descent was gradual.\r\nScarcely perceptible was its declination towards the water, upon which\r\nlay the two great flukes, slightly sunk below the surface, and extending\r\non each side to a breadth of many yards.\r\n\r\nThere were several sharks playing around the tail of the _cachalot_.\r\nThey might come within the pitch of a harpoon.  If not, the old whaleman\r\nknew how to attract them within easy reach of that formidable weapon.\r\n\r\nDirecting Snowball to bring after him some of the pieces of blubber,--\r\nwhich, in cutting out the harpoon, had been detached from the carcass,--\r\nBen proceeded towards the tail.  Here and there as he advanced, with the\r\nsharp edge of the harpoon blade; he cut out a number of holes in the\r\nspongy skin, in order to give both himself and his follower a more sure\r\nfooting on the slimy surface.\r\n\r\nAt the point where he intended to take his stand,--close in by the\r\n\"crutch\" of the _cachalot's_ tail-fin,--he made three excavations with\r\nmore care.  At length, satisfied with his preparations, he stood, with\r\npointed harpoon, waiting for we of the sharks to come within striking\r\ndistance.  They \"fought shy\" at first; but the old whaleman knew a way\r\nof overcoming their shyness.  It only required that \"chunk\" of blubber,\r\nheld in the hands of Snowball, to be thrown into the water, and\r\nsimultaneous with the plunge a score of sharks would be seen rushing,\r\nopen-mouthed, to seize upon it.\r\n\r\nThis in effect was precisely what transpired.\r\n\r\nThe blubber was dropped into the sea, close as possible to the carcass\r\nof the whale,--the sharks came charging towards it,--nearly twenty of\r\nthem.  The same number, however, did not go back as they had come; for\r\none of them, impaled by the harpoon of Ben Brace, was dragged out of his\r\nnative element, and hauled up the well-greased incline towards the\r\nhighest point on the carcass of the _cachalot_.\r\n\r\nThere, notwithstanding his struggles and the desperate as well as\r\ndangerous fluking of his posterior fins, he was soon despatched by the\r\naxe, wielded with all the might and dexterity which the Coromantee could\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nAnother shark was \"hooked,\" and then despatched in a similar fashion;\r\nand then another and another, until Ben Brace believed that enough\r\nshark-flesh had been obtained to furnish the _Catamaran_ with stores for\r\nthe most prolonged voyage.\r\n\r\nAt all events, they would now have food--such as it was--to last as long\r\nas the water with which the hand of Providence alone seemed to have\r\nprovided them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE THICK WATERS.\r\n\r\nThe most palatable portions of the sharks' flesh having been stripped\r\nfrom the bones and cut into thin slices, were now to be submitted to a\r\ndrying, or rather broiling process.  This was to be accomplished by a\r\nfire of spermaceti.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, there was no scarcity on the score of this fuel.  The\r\n\"case\" of the _cachalot_ contained enough to have roasted all the sharks\r\nwithin a circle of ten mile around it; and, to all appearance, there\r\nwere hundreds of them inside that circumference.  Indeed, that part of\r\nthe ocean where the dead whale had been found, though far from any land,\r\nis at all times most prolific in animal life.  Sometimes the sea for\r\nmiles around a ship will be seen swarming with fish of various kinds,\r\nwhile the air is filled with birds.  In the water may be seen large\r\n\"schools\" of whales, \"basking\"--as the whalers term it--at intervals,\r\n\"spouting\" forth their vaporous breath, or moving slowly onward,--some\r\nof them, every now and then, exhibiting their uncouth gambols.  Shoals\r\nof porpoises, albacores, bonitos, and other gregarious fishes will\r\nappear in the same place,--each kind in pursuit of its favourite prey,\r\nwhile sharks, threshers, and sword-fish, accompanied by their \"pilots\"\r\nand \"suckers,\" though in lesser numbers, here also abound,--from the\r\nvery abundance of the species on which these sea-monsters subsist\r\n\"Flocks\" of flying-fish sparkle in the sun with troops of bonitos\r\ngliding watchful below, while above them the sky will sometimes be\r\nliterally clouded with predatory birds,--gulls, boobies, gannets, tropic\r\nand frigate-birds, albatrosses, and a score of other kinds but little\r\nknown, and as yet undescribed by the naturalist.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked why so many creatures of different kinds congregate in\r\nthis part of the ocean?  Upon what do they subsist? what food can they\r\nfind so far from land?\r\n\r\nA ready reply to these questions may be given, by saying, that they\r\nsubsist upon each other; and this would be, to some extent, true.  But\r\nthen there must be a base forming the food for all, and produced by some\r\nprocess of nature.  What process can be going on in the midst of the\r\nocean to furnish the subsistence of such myriads of large and voracious\r\ncreatures?  In the waters of the great deep, apparently so pure and\r\nclear, one would think that no growth,--either animal or vegetable,\r\ncould spring up,--that nothing could come out of nothing.  For all this,\r\nin that pure, clear water, there is a continual process of production,--\r\nnot only from the soil at the bottom of the sea, but the salt-water\r\nitself contains the germs of material substances, that sustain life, or\r\nbecome, themselves, living things, by what appears, to our ignorant\r\neyes, spontaneous production.\r\n\r\nThere is no spontaneity in the matter.  It is simply the principle of\r\ncreation, and acting under laws and by ways that, however ill-understood\r\nby us, have existed from the beginning of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the whole extent of the great oceans are not thus\r\nthickly peopled.  Vast tracts may be traversed, where both fish and\r\nbirds of all kinds are extremely scarce; and a ship may sail for days\r\nwithout seeing an individual of either kind.  A hundred miles may be\r\npassed over, and the eye may not be gratified by the sight of a living\r\nthing,--either in the water or the air.  These tracts may truly be\r\ntermed the deserts of the sea; like those of the land, apparently\r\nuninhabited and uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, Why this difference, since the sea seems all alike?\r\nThe cause lies not in a difference of depth: for the tracts that teem\r\nwith life are variable in this respect,--sometimes only a few fathoms in\r\nprofundity, and sometime unfathomable.\r\n\r\nThe true explanation must be sought for elsewhere.  It will be found not\r\nin _depth_, but in _direction_,--in the direction of the currents.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows that the great oceans are intersected here and there by\r\ncurrents,--often hundreds of miles in breadth, but sometimes narrowing\r\nto a width of as many \"knots.\"  These oceanic streams are regular,\r\nthough not regularly defined.  They are not caused by mere temporary\r\nstorms, but by winds having a constant and regular direction; as the\r\n\"trades\" in the Atlantic and Pacific, the \"monsoons\" in the Indian\r\nOcean, the \"pamperos\" of South America, and the \"northers\" of the\r\nMexican Gulf.\r\n\r\nThere is another cause for these currents, perhaps of more powerful\r\ninfluence than the winds, yet less taken into account.  It is the\r\n_spinning_ of the earth on its axis.  Undoubtedly are the \"trades\"\r\nindebted to this for their direction towards the west,--the simple\r\ncentrifugal tendency of the atmosphere.  Otherwise, would these winds\r\nblow due northward and southward, coming into collision on the line of\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\nBut it is not my purpose to attempt a dissertation either on winds or\r\noceanic streams.  I am not learned enough for this, though enough to\r\nknow that great misconception prevails on this subject, as well as upon\r\nthat of the _tides_; and that meteorologists have not given due credit\r\nto the revolving motion of our planet, which is in truth the principal\r\nproducer of these phenomena.\r\n\r\nWhy I have introduced the subject at all is, not because our little book\r\nis peculiarly a book of the ocean, but, because that ocean currents have\r\nmuch to do with \"Ocean Waifs,\" and that these last afford the true\r\nexplanation of the phenomenon first-mentioned,--the fact that some parts\r\nof the ocean teem with animal life, while others are as dead as a\r\ndesert.  The currents account for it, thus:--where two of them meet,--as\r\nis often the case,--vast quantities of material substances, both\r\nvegetable and animal, are drifted together; where they are held, to a\r\ncertain extent, stationary; or circling around in great _ocean eddies_.\r\nThe wrack of sea-weed,--waifs from the distant shores,--birds that have\r\nfallen lifeless into the ocean, or drop their excrement to float on its\r\nsurface,--fish that have died of disease, violence, or naturally,--for\r\nthe finny tribes are not exempt from the natural laws of decay and\r\ndeath,--all these organisms, drifted by the currents, meet upon the\r\nneutral \"ground,\"--there to float about, and furnish food to myriads of\r\nliving creatures,--many species of which are, to all appearance, scarce\r\norganised more highly than the decomposed matters that appear first to\r\ngive them life, and afterwards sustain their existence.\r\n\r\nIn such tracts of the ocean are found the lower marine animals, in\r\nincalculable numbers; the floating shell-fish, as _Janthina_, _Hyalaea_\r\nand _Cleodora_; the sea-lizards, as _Velellae, Porpitae_, and their\r\nkindred; the squids, and other molluscs; with myriads of _medusa_.\r\n\r\nThese are the oceanic regions known to the sailors as \"thick waters,\"\r\nthe favourite resort of the whale and its concomitant creatures, whose\r\nfood they furnish; the shark, and its attendants; the dolphins,\r\nporpoises, sword-fish and flying-fish; with other denizens of the water;\r\nand a like variety of dwellers in the air, hovering above the surface,\r\neither as the enemies of those below, or aids to assist them in\r\ncomposing the inscrutable \"chain of destruction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nA WHALE ON FIRE!\r\n\r\nPerhaps we have _drifted_ too far adown the currents of the ocean.  From\r\nour digression let us return to out special \"Waifs.\"  We left them\r\nmaking preparations to roast the shark-flesh,--not in single steaks, but\r\nin a wholesale fashion,--as if they had intended to prepare a \"fish\r\ndinner\" for the full crew of a frigate.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, fuel they had in sufficiency; or, at all events, the\r\nbest of oil, that would serve as such.  The spermaceti could not be\r\nreadily kindled, nor its blaze kept up, without wicks.  But neither was\r\nthere any difficulty about this.  There was a quantity of old rope trash\r\non the raft, which had been fished up among the wreck of the _Pandora_,\r\nand kept in case of an emergency.  It needed only to restore this to its\r\noriginal state of tarry fibre, when they would be provided with wick\r\nenough to keep the lamp long burning.  It was the lamp itself, or rather\r\nthe cooking furnace, that caused them uneasiness.  They had none.  The\r\ntiny tin vessel that had already served for a single meal would never do\r\nfor the grand _roti_ they now designed making.  With it, along with time\r\nand patience, they might have accomplished the task; but time to them\r\nwas too precious to be so wasted; and as to patience,--circumstanced as\r\nthey were, it could scarcely be expected.\r\n\r\nThey stood in great need of a cooking-stove.  There was nothing on board\r\nthe _Catamaran_ that could be used as a substitute.  Indeed, to have\r\nkindled such a fire as they wanted on the raft,--without a proper\r\nmaterial for their hearth,--would have seriously endangered the\r\nexistence of the craft; and might have terminated in a conflagration.\r\n\r\nIt was a dilemma that had not suggested itself sooner--that is, until\r\nthe shark-steaks had been made ready for roasting.  Then it presented\r\nitself to their contemplation in full force, and apparently without any\r\nloophole to escape from it.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done for a cooking-stove?\r\n\r\nSnowball sighed as he thought of his caboose, with all its paraphernalia\r\nof pots and pans,--especially his great copper, in which he had been\r\naccustomed to boil mountains of meat and oceans of pea-soup.\r\n\r\nBut Snowball was not the individual to give way to vain regrets,--at\r\nleast, not for long.  Despite that absence of that superior intellect,--\r\nwhich flippant gossips of so-called a \"Social Science\" delight in\r\ndenying to his race, themselves often less gifted than he,--Snowball was\r\nendowed with rare ingenuity,--especially in matters relating to the\r\n_cuisine_, and in less than ten minutes after the question of a\r\ncooking-stove had been started, the Coromantee conceived the idea of one\r\nthat might have vied with any of the various \"patents\" so loudly\r\nextolled by the ironmongers, and yet not so effective when submitted to\r\nthe test.  At all events, Snowball's plan was suited to the\r\ncircumstances in which its contriver was placed; and perhaps it was the\r\nonly one which the circumstances would have allowed.\r\n\r\nUnlike other inventors, the Coromantee proclaimed the plan of his\r\ninvention as soon as he had conceived it.\r\n\r\n\"Wha' for?\" he asked, as the idea shaped itself in his skull,--\"wha' for\r\nwe trouble 'bout a pot fo' burn de oil?\"\r\n\r\n\"What for, Snowy!\" echoed the sailor, turning upon his interrogator an\r\nexpectant look.\r\n\r\n\"Why we no make de fire up hya?\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation was carried on upon the back of the whale,--where the\r\nsharks had been butchered and cut up.\r\n\r\n\"Up here!\" again echoed the sailor, still showing surprise.  \"What\r\nmatter whether it be up here or down theear, so long's we've got no\r\nvessel,--neyther pot nor pan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doan care a dam fo' neyder,\" responded the ex-cook.  \"I'se soon show\r\nye, Mass' Brace, how we find vessel, big 'nuff to hold all de oil in de\r\nkarkiss ob de ole cashlot, as you call him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Explain, nigger, explain!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sartin I do.  Gib me dat axe.  I soon 'splain de whole sarkumstance.\"\r\n\r\nBen passed the axe, which he had been holding, into the hands of the\r\nCoromantee.\r\n\r\nThe latter, as he had promised, soon made his meaning clear, by setting\r\nto work upon the carcass of the _cachalot_, and with less than a dozen\r\nblows of the sharp-edged tool hollowing out a large cavity in the\r\nblubber.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mass' Brace,\" cried he, when he had finished, triumphantly\r\nbalancing the axe above his shoulder, \"wha' you call dat?  Dar's a lamp\r\nhold all de oil we want set blaze.  You d'sire me `crow' de hole any\r\nwida or deepa, I soon make 'im deep's a draw-well an' wide as de track\r\nob a waggon.  Wha' say, Mass' Brace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurraw for you, Snowy!  It be just the thing.  I dar say it's deep\r\nenough, and wide as we'll want it.  You ha got good brains, nigger,--\r\nnot'ithstanding what them lubbers as they call filosaphurs say.  I'm a\r\nwhite, an' niver thought o' it.  This'll do for the furness we want.\r\nNothin' more needed than to pour the sparmacety into it, chuck a bit o'\r\noakum on the top, an' set all ablaze.  Let's do it, and cook the wittles\r\nat once.\"\r\n\r\nThe cavity, which Snowball had \"crowed\" in the carcass of the whale was\r\nsoon filled with oil taken from the case.  In this was inserted with due\r\ncare a quantity of the fibre, obtained by \"picking\" the old ropes into\r\noakum.\r\n\r\nA crane was next erected over the cavity,--a handspike forming one\r\nsupport and an oar the other.  The crane itself consisted of the long\r\niron arrow and socket of one of the harpoons found in the carcass of the\r\n_cachalot_.\r\n\r\nUpon this was suspended, as upon a spit, so many slices of shark-meat as\r\ncould be accommodated with room, and when all was arranged, a \"taper\"\r\nwas handed up from below, and the wick set on fire.\r\n\r\nThe tarry strands caught like tinder; and soon after a fierce bright\r\nblaze was seen rising several feet above the back of the _cachalot_,--\r\ncausing the shark-steaks to frizzle and fry, and promising in a very\r\nshort space of time to \"do them to a turn.\"\r\n\r\nAny one who could have witnessed the spectacle from distance, and not\r\nunderstanding its nature, might have fancied that the _whale was on\r\nfire_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE BIG RAFT.\r\n\r\nWhile the strange phenomenon of a blazing fire upon the back of a whale\r\nwas being exhibited to the eyes of ocean-birds and ocean-fishes,--all\r\ndoubtless wondering what it meant,--another and very different spectacle\r\nwas occurring scarce twenty miles from the spot,--of course also upon\r\nthe surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIf in the former there was something that might be called comic, there\r\nwas nothing of this in the latter.  On the contrary, it was a true\r\ntragedy,--a drama of death.\r\n\r\nThe stage upon which it was being enacted was a platform of planks and\r\nspars, rudely united together,--in short, a raft.  The _dramatis\r\npersona_ were men,--all men; although it might have required some\r\nstretch of imagination,--aided by a little acquaintanceship with the\r\ncircumstances that had placed them upon that raft,--to have been certain\r\nthat they were human beings.  A stranger to them, looking upon them in\r\nreality,--or upon a picture, giving a faithful representation of them,--\r\nmight have doubted their humanity, and mistaken them for _fiends_.  No\r\none could have been blamed for such a misconception.\r\n\r\nIf human beings in shape, and so in reality, they were fiends in aspect,\r\nand not far from it in mental conformation.  Even in appearance they\r\nwere more like skeletons than men.  One actually was a skeleton,--not a\r\nliving skeleton, but a corpse, clean-stripped of its flesh.  The\r\nensanguined bones, with some fragments of the cartilage still adhering\r\nto them, showed that the despoliation had been recent.  The skeleton was\r\nnot perfect.  Some of the bones were absent.  A few were lying near on\r\nthe timbers of the raft, and a few others might have been seen in places\r\nwhere it was horrible to behold them!\r\n\r\nThe raft was an oblong platform of some twenty feet in length by about\r\nfifteen in width.  It was constructed out of pieces of broken masts and\r\nspars of a ship, upon which was supported an irregular sheeting of\r\nplanks, the fragments of bulwarks, hatches, cabin-doors that had been\r\nwrested from their hinges, lids of tea-chests, coops, and a few other\r\narticles,--such as form the paraphernalia of movables on board a ship.\r\nThere was a large hogshead with two or three small barrels upon the\r\nraft; and around its edge were lashed several empty casks, serving as\r\nbuoys to keep it above water.  A single spar stood up out of its centre,\r\nor \"midships,\" to which was rigged--in a very slovenly manner--a large\r\nlateen sail,--either the spanker or spritsail of a ship, or the mizzen\r\ntopsail of a bark.\r\n\r\nAround the \"step\" of the mast a variety of other objects might have been\r\nseen: such as oars, handspikes, pieces of loose boards, some tangled\r\ncoils of rope, an axe or two, half a dozen tin pots and \"tots,\"--such as\r\nare used by sailors,--a quantity of shark-bones clean picked, with two\r\nor three other bones, like those already alluded to, and whose size and\r\nform told them to be the _tibia_ of a human skeleton.\r\n\r\nBetween twenty and thirty men were moving amid this miscellaneous\r\ncollection,--not all moving: for they were in every conceivable\r\nattitude, of repose as of action.  Some were seated, some lying\r\nstretched, some standing, some staggering,--as if reeling under the\r\ninfluence of intoxication, or too feeble to support their bodies in an\r\nerect attitude.  It was not any rocking on the part of the raft that was\r\nproducing these eccentric movements.  The sea was perfectly quiescent,\r\nand the rude embarkation rested upon it like a log.\r\n\r\nThe cause might have been discovered near the bottom of the mast, where\r\nstood a barrel or cask of medium size, from which proceeded an\r\nexhalation, telling its contents to be rum.\r\n\r\nThe staggering skeletons were _drunk_!\r\n\r\nIt was not that noisy intoxication that tells of recent indulgence, but\r\nrather of the nervous wreck which succeeds it; and the words heard,\r\ninstead of being the loud banterings of inebriated men, were more like\r\nthe ravings and gibbering of maniacs.  No wonder: since they who uttered\r\nthem _were_ mad,--mad with _mania potu_!  If they were ever to recover,\r\nit would be the last time they were likely to be afflicted by the same\r\ndisease,--at least on board that embarkation.  Not from any virtuous\r\nresolve on their parts, but simply from the fact that the cause of their\r\ninsanity no longer existed.\r\n\r\nThe rum-cask was as dry inside as out.  There was no longer a drop of\r\nthe infernal liquor on the raft; no more spirit of any kind to produce\r\nfresh drunkenness or renewed _delirium tremens_!\r\n\r\nThe madmen were not heeded by the others; but allowed to totter about,\r\nand give speech to their incoherent mumblings!--sometimes diversified by\r\nyells, or peals of mania laughter,--always thickly interlarded with\r\noaths and other blasphemous utterances.\r\n\r\nIt was only when disturbing the repose of some one less _exalted_ than\r\nthemselves, or when two of them chanced to come into collision, that a\r\nscene would ensue,--in some instances extending to almost every\r\nindividual on the raft, and ending by one or other of the delirious\r\ndisputants getting \"chucked\" into the sea, and having a swim before\r\nrecovering foothold on the frail embarkation.  This the ducked\r\nindividual would be certain to do.  Drunk as he might have been, and\r\nmaudlin as he might be, his instincts were never so benumbed as to\r\nrender him regardless of self-preservation.  Even from out his haggard\r\neyes still gleamed enough of intelligence to tell that those dark\r\ntriangular objects, moving in scores around the raft, and cutting the\r\nwater, so swift and sheer, were the dorsal fins of the dreaded sharks.\r\nEach one was a sight that, to a sailor's eye, even when \"blind drunk,\"\r\nbrings habitual dread.\r\n\r\nThe _douche_, and the fright attending it, would usually restore his\r\nreason to the delirious individual,--or, at all events, would have the\r\neffect of restoring tranquillity upon the raft,--soon after to be\r\ndisturbed by some scene of like, or perhaps more terrible, activity.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe reader, unacquainted with the history of this raft and the people\r\nupon it, may require some information concerning them.  A few words must\r\nsuffice for both.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, at the beginning of our narrative, a raft was\r\nconstructed out of such timbers as could be detached from the slave-bark\r\n_Pandora_,--after that vessel had caught fire, and previous to her\r\nblowing up.  Upon this embarkation the slaver's crew had escaped,\r\nleaving her _cargo_ to perish,--some by the explosion, some by drowning,\r\nand not a few by the teeth of sharks.  The _Pandora's_ captain, along\r\nwith five others,--including the mates and carpenter,--had stolen away\r\nwith the gig.  As this was the only boat found available in the fearful\r\ncrisis of the conflagration, the remainder of the crew had betaken\r\nthemselves to the large raft, hurriedly constructed for the occasion.\r\n\r\nAs already related, Snowball and the Portuguese girl were the only\r\nindividuals on board the _Pandora_ who had remained by the wreck, or\r\nrather among its _debris_.  There the Coromantee, by great courage and\r\ncunning, had succeeded not only in keeping himself and his _protege_\r\nafloat, but in establishing a chance for sustaining existence,\r\ncalculated to last for some days.  It is known also that Ben Brace with\r\n_his protege_, having been informed by the captain's parting speech that\r\nthere was a barrel of gunpowder aboard the burning bark, apprehensive of\r\nthe explosion, had silently constructed a little raft of his own; which,\r\nafter being launched from under the bows of the slaver, he had brought\r\n_en rapport_ with the \"big raft,\" and thereto attached it.  This\r\n\"tender,\" still carrying the English sailor and the boy, had been\r\nafterwards cut loose from its larger companion in the dead hour of\r\nnight, and permitted to fall far into the wake.  The reason of this\r\ndefection was simply to save little William from being eaten up by the\r\nex-crew of the _Pandora_, then reduced to a famished condition,--if we\r\nmay use the phrase, screwed up to the standard of anthropophagy.\r\n\r\nSince the hour in which the two rafts became separated from each other,\r\nthe reader is acquainted, in all its minute details, with the history of\r\nthe lesser: how it joined issue with the embarkation that carried the\r\nex-cook and his _protege_; how the union with the latter produced a\r\ncross between the two,--afterwards yclept the _Catamaran_; with all the\r\nparticulars of the _Catamaran's_ voyage, up to the time when she became\r\nmoored alongside the carcass of the _cachalot_; and for several days\r\nafter.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the \"big raft\" carrying the crew of tin burnt bark,--\r\nbeing out of sight, may also have escaped from the reader's mind.  Both\r\nit and its occupants were still in existence.  Not all of them, it is\r\ntrue, but the greater number; and among these, the most prominent in\r\nstrength of body, energy of mind; and wickedness of disposition.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce necessary to say, that the raft now introduced as lying\r\nupon the ocean some twenty miles from the dead _cachalot_ was that which\r\nsome days before had parted from the _Pandora_, or that the fiendish\r\nforms that occupied it were the remnant of the _Pandora's_ crew.\r\n\r\nThese were not all there: nearly a score of them were absent.  The\r\nabsence of the captain, with five others who had accompanied him in his\r\ngig, has been explained.  The ex-cook, the English sailor and\r\nsailor-boy, with the cabin passenger, Lilly Lalee, have also been\r\naccounted for; but there were several others aboard the big raft, on its\r\nfirst starting \"to sea,\" that were no longer to be seen amidst the crowd\r\nstill occupying this ungainly embarkation.  Half a dozen,--perhaps\r\nmore,--seemed to be missing.  Their absence might have appeared\r\nmysterious, to anyone who had not been kept \"posted\" up in the\r\nparticulars of the ill-directed cruise through which the raft had been\r\npassing; though the skeleton above described, and the dissevered _tibia_\r\nscattered around, might have given a clew to their disappearance,--at\r\nleast, to anyone initiated into the shifts and extremities of\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nTo those of less experience,--or less quick comprehension,--it may be\r\nnecessary to repeat the conversation which was being carried on upon the\r\nraft,--at the moment when it is thus reintroduced to the notice of the\r\nreader.  A correct report of this will satisfactorily explain why its\r\noriginal crew had been reduced, from over thirty, to the number of\r\nsix-and-twenty, exclusive of the skeleton!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA CREW OF CANNIBALS.\r\n\r\n\"_Allons_!\" cried a black-bearded man, in whose emaciated frame it was\r\nnot easy to recognise the once corpulent bully of the slave-ship,--the\r\nFrenchman, Le Gros.  \"_Allons! messieurs_!  It's time to try fortune\r\nagain.  _Sacre_! we must eat, or die!\"\r\n\r\nThe question may be asked, What were these men to eat?  There appeared\r\nto be no food upon the raft.  There _was_ none,--not a morsel of any\r\nkind that might properly be called meat for man.  Nor had there been,\r\never since the second day after the departure of the raft from the side\r\nof the burning bark.  A small box of sea-biscuits, that, when\r\ndistributed, gave only two to each man, was all that had been saved in\r\ntheir hurried retreat from the decks of the _Pandora_.  These had\r\ndisappeared in a day.  They had brought away water in greater abundance,\r\nand caught some since in their shirts, and on the spread sail,--nearly\r\nafter the same fashion and in the same rain-storm that had afforded the\r\nwell-timed supply to Ben Brace and his _protege_.\r\n\r\nBut the stock derived from both sources was on the eve of being\r\nexhausted.  Only a small ration or two to each man remained in the cask;\r\nbut thirsty as most of them might be, they were suffering still more\r\nfrom the kindred appetite of hunger.\r\n\r\nWhat did Le Gros mean when he said they must eat?  What food was there\r\non the raft, to enable them to avoid the terrible alternative appended\r\nto his proposal,--\"eat, or die\"!  What _had_ kept them from dying: since\r\nit was now many days, almost weeks, since they had swallowed the last\r\nmorsel of biscuit so sparingly distributed amongst them?\r\n\r\nThe answer to all these interrogatories is one and the some.  It is too\r\nfearful to be pronounced,--awful even to think of!\r\n\r\nThe clean-stripped skeleton lying upon the raft, and which was clearly\r\nthat of a human being; the bones scattered about,--some of them, as\r\nalready observed, held in hand, and in such fashion as to show the\r\nhorrid use that was being made of them,--left no doubt as to the nature\r\nof the food upon which the hungering wretches had been subsisting.\r\n\r\nThis, and the flesh of a small shark, which they had succeeded in luring\r\nalongside, and killing with the blow of a handspike, had been their only\r\nprovision since parting with the _Pandora_.  There were sharks enough\r\naround them now.  A score, at the very least, might have been quartering\r\nthe sea, within sight of the raft; but these monsters, strange to say,\r\nwere so shy, that not one of them would approach near enough to allow\r\nthem an opportunity of capturing it!  Every attempt to take them had\r\nproved unsuccessful.  Such of the crew as kept sober had been trying for\r\ndays.  Some were even at that moment engaged with hook and line, angling\r\nfor the ferocious fish,--their hooks floating far out in the water,\r\nbaited with _human flesh_.\r\n\r\nIt was only the mechanical continuation of a scheme that had long since\r\nproved to be of no avail,--a sort of despairing struggle against\r\nimprobability.  The sharks had taken the alarm; perhaps from observing\r\nthe fate of that one of their number that had gone too near the odd\r\nembarkation; or, perhaps, warned by some mysterious instinct, that,\r\nsooner or later, they would make a grand banquet on those who were so\r\neager to feast upon them.\r\n\r\nIn any case, no sharks had been taken, or were likely to be taken; and\r\nonce more the eyes of the famishing castaways were wolfishly turned upon\r\none another, while their thoughts reverted to that horrible alternative\r\nthat was to save them from starvation.\r\n\r\nLe Gros--on board the raft, as upon the deck of the slave-ship--still\r\nheld a sort of fatal ascendency over his comrades; and with Ben Brace no\r\nlonger to oppose his despotic propensities, he had established over his\r\nfellow-skeletons a species of arbitrary rule.\r\n\r\nHis conduct had all along been guided by no more regard for fair-play\r\nthan was just necessary to keep his subordinates from breaking out into\r\nopen mutiny; and among these the weaker ones fared even worse than their\r\nfellows, bad as that was.\r\n\r\nA few of the stronger,--who formed a sort of bodyguard to the bully, and\r\nwere ready to stand up for him in case of extremity,--shared his\r\nascendency over the rest; and to these were distributed larger rations\r\nof water, along with the more choice morsels of their horrid food.\r\n\r\nThis partiality had more than once led to scenes, that promised to end\r\nin bloodshed; and but for this occasional show of resistance, Le Gros\r\nand his party might have established a tyranny that would have given\r\nthem full power over the _lives_ of their feebler companions.\r\n\r\nThings were fast tending in this direction,--merging, as it were, into\r\nabsolute monarchy,--a monarchy of \"cannibals,\" of which Le Gros himself\r\nwould be \"king.\"  It had not yet, however, quite come to that,--at least\r\nwhen it became a question of life and death.  When the necessity arose\r\nof finding a fresh victim for their horrible but necessary sacrifice,\r\nthere was still enough republicanism left among the wretches to\r\ninfluence the decision in a just and equitable manner, and cause the\r\nselection to be made by lot.  When it comes to crises like these,--to\r\nquestions of life and death,--men must yield up their opposition to the\r\n_ballot_, and acknowledge its equity.\r\n\r\nLe Gros and his cruel bodyguard would have opposed it had they been\r\nstrong enough,--as do equally cruel politicians who are strong enough,--\r\nbut the bully still doubted the strength of his party.  A proposal so\r\natrocious had beep made, in the case of little William, at the very\r\noutset, and had met with but slight opposition.  Had it not been for the\r\nbrave English sailor, the lad would certainly have fallen a sacrifice to\r\nthe horrid appetites of these horrid men.  With one of themselves,\r\nhowever, the case was different.  Each had a few adherents, who would\r\nnot have submitted to such an arbitrary cruelty; and Le Gros was\r\ninfluenced by the fear of a general \"skrimmage,\" in which more than one\r\nlife,--among the rest perhaps his own,--might be forfeited.  The time\r\nfor such a high-handed measure had not yet arrived; and when it came to\r\nthe question of \"Who dies next?\" it was still found necessary to resort\r\nto the _ballot_.\r\n\r\nThat question was once more propounded,--now for the third time,--Le\r\nGros himself acting as the spokesman.  No one said anything in reply, or\r\nmade any sign of being opposed to an answer being given.  On the\r\ncontrary, all appeared to yield, if not a cheerful, at least a tacit\r\nassent to what they all knew to be meant for a proposal,--knowing also\r\nits fearful nature and consequences.\r\n\r\nThey also comprehended whence the answer was to come.  Twice before had\r\nthey consulted that dread oracle, whose response was certain death to\r\none of their number.  Twice before had they recognised and submitted to\r\nits decree.  No preliminaries needed to be discussed.  These had been\r\nlong ago arranged.  There was nothing more to do than cast the lots.\r\n\r\nOn the moment after Le Gros had put the question, a movement was visible\r\namong the men to whom it was addressed.  One might have expected it to\r\nstartle them; but it did not appear to do this,--at least, to any great\r\nextent.  Some only showed those signs of fear distinguishable by\r\nblanched cheeks and white lips; but there were some too delirious to\r\nunderstand the full import of what was to follow; and the majority of\r\nthe crew had become too callow with suffering to care much even for\r\nlife!\r\n\r\nMost that could, however,--for there were some too feeble to stand\r\nerect,--rose to their feet, and gathered around the challenger,\r\nexhibiting both in their words and attitudes, an earnestness that told\r\nthem not altogether indifferent to death.\r\n\r\nBy a sort of tacit agreement among them, Le Gros acted as master of the\r\nceremonies,--the dispenser of that dread lottery of life and death, in\r\nwhich he himself was to take a share.  Two or three of his fellows stood\r\non each side of him, acting as aids or _croupiers_.\r\n\r\nSolemn and momentous as was the question to be decided, the mode of\r\ndecision was simple in the extreme.  Le Gros held in his hand a canvas\r\nbag, of oblong bolster shape,--such as sailors use to carry their spare\r\nsuit of \"Sunday go-ashores.\"  In the bottom of this bag,--already\r\ncarefully counted into it,--were twenty-six buttons: the exact number of\r\nthose who were to take part in the drawing.  They were the common black\r\nbuttons of horn,--each pierced with four holes,--such as may be seen\r\nupon the jacket of the merchant sailor.  They had been cut from their\r\nown garments for the purpose in which they were now, a third time, to be\r\nemployed, and all chosen so exactly alike, that even the eye would have\r\nfound it difficult to distinguish one from the other.  One, however,\r\noffered an exception to this statement.  While all its fellows were jet\r\nblack, it exhibited a reddish hue,--a dark crimson,--as if it had been\r\ndefiled with blood.  And so it had been; stained on purpose,--that for\r\nwhich it was to be employed,--to be the exponent of the _prize_, in that\r\nlottery of blood, of which its colour was an appropriate emblem.\r\n\r\nThe difference between it and the others was not perceptible to the\r\ntouch.  The fingers of a man born blind could not have distinguished it\r\namong the rest,--much less the callous and tar-bedaubed \"claws\" of a\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\nThe red button was cast into the bag along with the others.  \"_He who\r\nshould draw it forth must die_.\"\r\n\r\nAs we have said, there was no settling about preliminaries, no talking\r\nabout choice as to the time of drawing.  These matters had been\r\ndiscussed before, both openly and by secret mental calculations.  All\r\nhad arrived at the conclusion that the chances were even, and that it\r\ncould make no difference in the event as to whose fate was first\r\ndecided.  The red button might be the last in the bag, or it might be\r\nthe first drawn out of it.\r\n\r\nUnder this impression, no one hesitated to inaugurate the dread ceremony\r\nof the drawing; and as soon as Le Gros held out the bag,--just open\r\nenough to admit a hand,--a man stepped up, and, with an air of reckless\r\nindifference, plunged his arm into the opening!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nTHE LOTTERY OF LIFE AND DEATH.\r\n\r\nOne by one the buttons were drawn forth from the bag,--each man, as he\r\ndrew his, exhibiting it in his open palm, to satisfy the others as to\r\nits colour, and then placing it in a common receptacle,--against the\r\ncontingency of its being required again for another like lottery!\r\n\r\nSolemn as was the character of the ceremony, it was not conducted either\r\nin solemnity or silence.  Many of the wretches even jested while it was\r\nin progress; and a stranger to the dread conditions under which the\r\ndrawing was being made might have supposed it a raffle for some trifling\r\nprize!\r\n\r\nThe faces of a few, however, would have contradicted this supposition.\r\nA few there were who approached the oracle with cowed and craven looks;\r\nand their trembling fingers, as they inserted them into the bag,\r\nproclaimed an apprehension stronger than could have arisen from any mere\r\ncourting of chance in an ordinary casting of lots.\r\n\r\nThose men who were noisiest and most gleeful _after_ they had drawn were\r\nthe ones who before it had shown the strongest signs of fear, and who\r\ntrembled most while performing the operation.\r\n\r\nSome of them could not conceal even their demoniac joy at having drawn\r\nblank, but danced about over the raft as if they had suddenly succeeded\r\nto some splendid fortune.\r\n\r\nThe difference between this singular lottery and most others, was that\r\nthe blanks were the prizes,--the prize itself being the true blank,--the\r\nending of existence.\r\n\r\nLe Gros continued to hold the bag, and with an air of nonchalance;\r\nthough anyone closely observing his countenance could tell that it was\r\nassumed.  As had been already proved, the French bully was at heart a\r\ncoward.  Under the influence of angry passion, or excited by a desire\r\nfor revenge, he could show fight, and even fling himself into positions\r\nof danger; but in a contest such as that in which he was now engaged a\r\ncool strife, in which Fortune was his only antagonist, and in which he\r\ncould derive no advantage from any unfair subterfuge, his artificial\r\ncourage had entirely forsaken him.\r\n\r\nSo long as the lottery was in its earlier stages, and only a few buttons\r\nhad been taken out of the bag, he preserved his assumed air of\r\nindifference.  There were still many chances of life against that one of\r\ndeath,--nearly twenty to one.  As the drawing proceeded, however, and\r\none after another exhibited his black button, a change could be observed\r\npassing over the features of the Frenchman.  His apparent _sangfroid_\r\nbegan to forsake him; while his glances betokened a feverish excitement,\r\nfast hastening towards apprehension.\r\n\r\nAs each fresh hand came up out of the dark receptacle bearing the\r\nevidence of its owner's fate, Le Gros was seen to cast hurried and\r\nanxious glances towards the tiny circle of horn, held between the thumb\r\nand forefinger, and each time that he saw the colour to be black his\r\ncountenance appeared to darken at the sight.\r\n\r\nWhen the twentieth button had been brought forth, and still the red one\r\nremained in the bag, the master of the ceremonies became fearfully\r\nexcited.  He could no longer conceal his apprehension.  His chances of\r\nlife were diminished to a point that might well inspire him with fear.\r\nIt was now but six to one,--for there were only six more tickets to be\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis, Le Gros interrupted the drawing to reflect.  Would he be\r\nin a better position, if some one else held the bag?  Perhaps that might\r\nchange the run of luck hitherto against him; and which he had been\r\ncursing with all his might ever since the number had been going through\r\nthe teens.  He had tried every way he could think of to tempt the red\r\nticket out of the bag.  He had shaken the buttons time after time,--in\r\nhopes of bringing it to the top, or in some position that might insure\r\nits being taken up.  But all to no purpose.  It would obstinately stay\r\nto the last.\r\n\r\nWhat difference could it make were he to hand the bag over to some other\r\nholder, and try his luck for the twenty-first chance?  \"Not any!\" was\r\nthe mental reply he received to this mental inquiry.  Better for him to\r\nhold on as he had been doing.  It was hardly possible--at least highly\r\nimprobable--that the red button should be the last.  There had been\r\ntwenty-five chances to one against its being so.  It is true twenty\r\nblack buttons had been drawn out before it,--in a most unexpected\r\nmanner,--still it was as likely to come next as any of the remaining\r\nsix.\r\n\r\nIt would be of no use changing the process,--so concluded he, in his own\r\nmind,--and, with an air of affected recklessness, the Frenchman\r\nsignified to those around him that he was ready to continue the drawing.\r\n\r\nAnother man drew forth Number 21.  Like those preceding it, the button,\r\nwas black!\r\n\r\nNumber 22 was fished out of the bag,--black also!\r\n\r\n23 and 24 were of the like hue!\r\n\r\nBut two buttons now remained,--two men only whose fate was undecided.\r\nOne of them was Le Gros himself,--the other, an Irish sailor, who was,\r\nperhaps, the least wicked among that wicked crew.  One or other of them\r\nmust become food for their cannibal comrades!\r\n\r\nIt would scarce be true to say that the interest increased as the dread\r\nlottery progressed towards its ending.  Its peculiar conditions had\r\nsecured an interest from the first as intense as it was possible for it\r\nto be.  It only became changed in character,--less selfish, if we may\r\nuse the phrase,--as each individual escaped from the dangerous\r\ncontingency involved in the operation.  As the drawing approached its\r\ntermination, the anxiety about the result, though less painful to the\r\nmajority of the men, was far more so to the few whose fate still hung\r\nsuspended in the scale; and this feeling became more intensified in the\r\nbreasts of the still smaller number, who saw their chances of safety\r\nbecoming constantly diminished.  When, at length, only two buttons\r\nremained in the bag, and only two men to draw them out, the interest,\r\nthough changed in character, was nevertheless sufficiently exciting to\r\nfix the attention of every individual on the raft.\r\n\r\nThere were circumstances, apart from the mere drawing, that influenced\r\nthis attention.  Fate itself seemed to be taking a part in the dread\r\ndrama; or, if not, a very singular contingency had occurred.\r\n\r\nBetween the two men, thus left to decide its decree, there existed a\r\nrivalry,--or, rather, might it be called a positive antipathy,--deadly\r\nas any _vendetta_ ever enacted on Corsican soil.\r\n\r\nIt had not sprung up on the raft.  It was of older date--old as the\r\nearliest days of the _Pandora's_ voyage, on whose decks it had\r\noriginated.\r\n\r\nIts first seeds had been sown in that quarrel between Le Gros and Ben\r\nBrace,--in which the Frenchman had been so ignominiously defeated.  The\r\nIrish sailor,--partly from some slight feeling of co-nationality, and\r\npartly from a natural instinct of fair-play,--had taken sides with the\r\nBritish tar; and, as a consequence, had invoked the hostility of the\r\nFrenchman.  This feeling he had reciprocated to its full extent; and\r\nfrom that time forward Larry O'Gorman--such was the Irishman's name--\r\nbecame the true _bete noir_ of Le Gros, to be insulted by the latter on\r\nevery occasion that might offer.  Even Ben Brace was no longer regarded\r\nwith as much dislike.  For him the Frenchman had been taught, if not\r\nfriendship, at least, a certain respect, springing from fear; and,\r\ninstead of continuing his jealous rivalry towards the English sailor, Le\r\nGros had resigned himself to occupy a secondary place on the slaver, and\r\ntransferred his spite to the representative of the Emerald Isle.\r\n\r\nMore than once, slight collisions had occurred between them,--in which\r\nthe Frenchman, gifted with greater cunning, had managed to come off\r\nvictorious.  But there had never arisen any serious matter to test the\r\nstrength of the two men to that desperate strife, of which death might\r\nbe the ending.  They had generally fought shy of each other; the\r\nFrenchman from a latent fear of his adversary,--founded, perhaps, on\r\nsome suspicion of powers not yet exhibited by him, and which might be\r\ndeveloped in a deadly struggle,--the Irishman from a habitude, not very\r\ncommon among his countrymen, of being little addicted to quarrelling.\r\nHe was, on the contrary, a man of peaceful disposition, and of few\r\nwords,--also a rare circumstance, considering that his name was Larry\r\nO'Gorman.\r\n\r\nThere were some good traits in the Irishman's character.  Perhaps we\r\nhave given the best.  In comparison with the Frenchman, he might be\r\ndescribed as an angel; and, compared with the other wretches on the\r\nraft, he was, perhaps, the _least bad_: for the word _best_ could not,\r\nwith propriety, be applied to anyone of that motley crew.\r\n\r\nPersonally, the two men were unlike as could well be.  While the\r\nFrenchman was black and bearded, the Irishman was red and almost\r\nbeardless.  In size, however, they approximated nearer to each other,--\r\nboth being men of large stature.  Both had been stout,--almost\r\ncorpulent.\r\n\r\nNeither could be so described as they assisted at that solemn ceremonial\r\nthat was to devote one or other of them to a doom--in which their\r\n_condition_ was a circumstance of significant interest to those who were\r\nto survive them.\r\n\r\nBoth were shrunken in shape, with their garments hanging loosely around\r\ntheir bodies, their eyes sunk in deep cavities, their cheek-bones\r\nprominently protruding, their breasts flat and fleshless, the ribs\r\neasily discernible,--in short, they appeared more like a pair of\r\nskeletons, covered with shrivelled skin, than breathing, living men.\r\nEither was but ill-adapted for the purpose to which dire necessity was\r\nabout to devote one or other of them.\r\n\r\nOf the two, Le Gros appeared the less attenuated.  This may have arisen\r\nfrom the fact of his greater ascendency over the crew of the raft,--by\r\nmeans of which he had been enabled to appropriate to himself a larger\r\nshare of the food sparsely distributed amongst them.  His ample covering\r\nof hair may have had something to do with this appearance,--concealing\r\nas it did the unevenness of the surface upon which it grew, and\r\nimparting a plumper aspect to his face and features.\r\n\r\nIf there was a superiority in the quantity of flesh still clinging to\r\nhis bones, its quality might be questioned,--at all events, in regard to\r\nthe use that might soon be made of it.  In point of tenderness, his\r\nmuscular integuments could scarcely compare with those of the Irishman,\r\nwhose bright skin promised--\r\n\r\nThese are horrid thoughts.  They should not be her repeated, were it not\r\nto show in its true light the terrible extremes, both of thought and\r\naction, to which men may be reduced by starvation.  Horrid as they may\r\nappear, they were entertained at that crisis by the castaway crew of the\r\n_Pandora_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTY NINE.\r\n\r\nA CHALLENGE DECLINED.\r\n\r\nWhen it came to the last drawing,--for there needed to be only one\r\nmore,--there was a pause in the proceedings, such as usually precedes an\r\nexpected climax.\r\n\r\nIt was accompanied by silence; so profound that, but for the noise made\r\nby the waves as they dashed against the hollow hogsheads, a pin might\r\nhave been heard if dropped upon the planking of the raft.  In the sound\r\nof the sea there was something lugubrious: a fit accompaniment of the\r\nunhallowed scene that was being enacted by those within hearing of it.\r\nOne might have fancied that spirits in fearful pain were confined within\r\nthe empty casks, and that the sounds that seemed to issue out of them\r\nwere groans elicited by their agony.\r\n\r\nThe two men, one of whom was doomed to die, stood face to face; the\r\nothers forming a sort of circle around them.  All eyes were bent upon\r\nthem, while theirs were fixed only upon each other.  The reciprocated\r\nglance was one of dire hostility and hate,--combined with a hope on the\r\npart of each to see the other dead, and then to survive him.\r\n\r\nBoth were inspired by a belief--in the presence of such an unexpected\r\ncontingency it was not unreasonable--that Fate had singled them out from\r\ntheir fellows to stand in that strange antagonism.  They were, in fact,\r\nconvinced of it.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this conviction, it might be supposed that\r\nneither would offer any further opposition to Fate's decree, but would\r\nyield to what might appear their \"manifest destiny.\"\r\n\r\nAs it was, however, fatalism was not the faith of either.  Though\r\nneither of them could lay claim to the character of a Christian, they\r\nwere equally unbelievers in this particular article of the creed of\r\nMahomet; and both were imbued with a stronger belief in strength or\r\nstratagem than in chance.\r\n\r\nOn the first-mentioned the Irishman appeared most to rely, as was\r\nevidenced by the proposal he made upon the occasion.\r\n\r\n\"I dar yez,\" said he, \"to thry which is the best man.  To dhraw them\r\nbuttons is an even chance between us; an' maybe the best man is him\r\nthat'll have to die.  By Saint Pathrick! that isn't fair, nohow.  The\r\nbest man should be allowed to live.  Phwat do _yez_ say, comrades?\"\r\n\r\nThe proposal, though unexpected by all, found partisans who entertained\r\nit.  It put a new face upon the affair.  It was one that was not more\r\nthan reasonable.\r\n\r\nThe crew, no longer interested in the matter,--at least, so far as their\r\nown personal safety was concerned,--could now contemplate the result\r\nwith calmness; and the instinct of justice was not dead within the\r\nhearts of all of them.  In the challenge of the Irishman there appeared\r\nnothing unfair.  A number of them were inclined to entertain it, and\r\ndeclared themselves of that view.\r\n\r\nThe partisans of Le Gros were the more numerous; and these remained\r\nsilent,--waiting until the latter should make reply to the proposal of\r\nhis antagonist.\r\n\r\nAfter the slight luck he had already experienced in the lottery,--\r\ncombined with several partial defeats erst inflicted upon the man who\r\nthus challenged him,--it might have been expected that Le Gros would\r\nhave gladly accepted the challenge.\r\n\r\nHe did not.  On the contrary, he showed such an inclination to trust to\r\n_chance_ that a close observer of his looks and actions might have seen\r\ncause to suspect that he had also some reliance upon _stratagem_.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, had been thus closely observing him.  No one--except\r\nthe individual immediately concerned--had noticed that quick grasp of\r\nhands between him and one of his partisans; or, if they had, it was only\r\nto interpret it as a salute of sympathy, extended towards a comrade in a\r\nsituation of danger.\r\n\r\nIn that salute, however, there passed between the two men something of\r\nsignificance; which, if exhibited to the eyes of the spectators, would\r\nhave explained the indifference to death that from that moment\r\ncharacterised the demeanour of Le Gros.\r\n\r\nAfter that furtive movement, he no longer showed any hesitancy as to his\r\ncourse of action; but at once declared his willingness, as well as his\r\ndetermination, to abide by the decision of the drawing.\r\n\r\n\"_Sacre_!\" cried he, in answer to the challenge of the Irishman; \"you\r\ndon't suppose, _Monsieur Irlandais_, that I should fear the result as\r\nyou propose it?  _Parbleu_! nobody will believe that.  But I'm a\r\nbeliever in Fortune,--notwithstanding the scurvy tricks she has often\r\nserved me--even now that she is frowning upon me black as ever.  Neither\r\nof us appears to be in favour with her, and that will make our chances\r\nequal.  So then, I say, let us try her again.  _Sacre_! it will be the\r\nlast time she can frown on one of us,--that's certain.\"\r\n\r\nAs O'Gorman had no right to alter the original programme of the lottery,\r\nof course the dissenting voices to its continuance were in the minority;\r\nand the general clamour tailed upon fate to decide which of the two men\r\nwas to become food for their famishing companions.\r\n\r\nLe Gros still held the bag containing the two buttons.  One of them\r\nshould be black, the other red.  It became a subject of dispute, which\r\nwas to make the draw.  It was not a question of who should draw first,\r\nsince one button taken out would be sufficient.  If the red one came\r\nout, the drawer must die; if the black, then the other must become the\r\nvictim.\r\n\r\nSome proposed that a third party should hold the bag, and that there\r\nshould be a toss up for the first chance.  Le Gros showed a disposition\r\nto oppose this plan.  He said that, as he had been intrusted with the\r\nsuperintendence so far, he should continue it to the end.  They all\r\nsaw,--so urged he,--that he had not benefited by the office imposed upon\r\nhim; but the contrary.  It had brought nothing but ill-luck to him; and,\r\nas everybody knew, when a run of ill-luck once sets in, there was no\r\nknowing where it might terminate.  He did not care much, one way or the\r\nother: since there could be no advantage in his holding the bag; but as\r\nhe had done so all through,--as he believed to his disadvantage,--he was\r\nwilling to hold on, even if it was death that was to be his award.\r\n\r\nThe speech of Le Gros had the desired effect.  The majority declared\r\nthemselves in favour of his continuing to hold the bag; and it was\r\ndecided that the Irishman should make choice of the _penultimate_\r\nbutton.\r\n\r\nThe latter offered no opposition to this arrangement.  There appeared no\r\nvalid grounds for objecting to it.  It was a simple toss of heads and\r\ntails,--\"Heads I win, and tails you lose\"; or, to make use of a formula\r\nmore appropriate to the occasion, \"Heads I live, and tails you die.\"\r\nWith some such process of reasoning current through the brain of Larry\r\nO'Gorman, he stepped boldly up to the bag; plunged his fist into its\r\nobscure interior; and drew forth--_the black button_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY.\r\n\r\nAN UNEXPECTED TERMINATION.\r\n\r\nThe red button remained in the bag.  It was a singular circumstance that\r\nit should be the last; but such strange circumstances will sometimes\r\noccur.  It belonged to Le Gros.  The lottery was over; the Frenchman had\r\nforfeited life.\r\n\r\nIt seemed idle for him to draw the button out; and yet, to the\r\nastonishment of the spectators, he proceeded to do so.\r\n\r\n\"_Sacre_!\" he exclaimed, \"the luck's been against me.  _Eh bien_!\" he\r\nadded, with a _sangfroid_ that caused some surprise, \"I suppose I must\r\nmake a die of it.  Let me see the accursed thing that's going to condemn\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he held up the bag in his left hand,--at the same time\r\nplunging his right into its dark interior.  For some seconds he\r\nappeared, to grope about, as if he had some difficulty in finding the\r\nbutton.  While fumbling in this fashion he let go the mouth of the\r\nwallet, which he had been holding in his left hand,--adroitly\r\ntransferring his hold to its bottom.  This was done apparently for the\r\npurpose of getting the button into a corner,--in order that he might lay\r\nhold of it with his fingers.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the bag rested upon his left forearm, while he\r\ncontinued his hunt after the little piece of horn.  He appeared\r\nsuccessful at length; and drew forth his right hand, with the fingers\r\nclosed over the palm, as if containing something,--of course the dread\r\nsymbol of death.  Stirred by a kind of curiosity, his comrades pressed\r\nmechanically around, and stood watching his movements.\r\n\r\nFor an instant he kept his fist closed, holding it on high to that all\r\nmight see it: and then, slowly extending his fingers, he exhibited his\r\nspread palm before their eyes.  It held the button that he had drawn\r\nforth from the bag; but, to the astonishment of all, it was a _black_\r\none, and not the _red_ token that had been expected!\r\n\r\nThere were but two men who did not partake of this surprise.  One was Le\r\nGros himself,--though, to all appearance, he was the most astonished\r\nindividual of the party,--the other was the man who, some minutes\r\nbefore, might have been observed standing by his side, and stealthily\r\ntransferring something from his own fingers to those of the Frenchman.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected termination of the lottery led to a scene of terrific\r\nexcitement.  Several seized hold of the bag,--jerking it out of the hand\r\nof him who had hitherto been holding it.  It was at once turned inside\r\nout; when the red button fell upon the planking of the raft.\r\n\r\nMost of the men were furious, and loudly declared that they had been\r\ncheated,--some offering conjectures as to how the cheat had been\r\naccomplished.  The confederate of Le Gros--backed by the ruffian\r\nhimself--suggested that there might have been no deception about the\r\nmatter, but only a mistake made in the number of buttons originally\r\nthrown into the bag.  \"Like enough,--damned like enough!\"--urged Le\r\nGros's sharping partner; \"there's been a button too many put into the\r\nbag,--twenty-seven instead of twenty-six.  That's how it's come about.\r\nWell, as we all helped at the counting of 'em, therefore it's nobody's\r\nfault in particular.  We'll have to draw again, and the next time we can\r\nbe more careful.\"\r\n\r\nAs no one appeared able to contradict this hypothesis, it passed off,\r\nwith a number, as the correct one.  Most of the men, however, felt sure\r\nthat a trick had been played; and the trick itself could be easily\r\nconjectured.  Some one of the drawers had procured a button similar to\r\nthose inside the bag; and holding this button, had simply inserted his\r\nhand, and drawn it out again.\r\n\r\nOut of twenty-six draws it would have been impossible to fix upon the\r\nindividual who had been guilty of the cheat, though there were not a few\r\nwho permitted their suspicions to fall on Le Gros himself.  There had\r\nbeen observed something peculiar in his mode of manipulation.  He had\r\ninserted his hand into the wallet with the fist closed; and had drawn it\r\nout in similar fashion.  This, with one or two other circumstances,\r\nlooked suspicious enough; but it was remembered that some others had\r\ndone the same; and as there was not enough of evidence to bring home the\r\ninfamous act to its perpetrator, no one appeared either able or willing\r\nto risk making the accusation.\r\n\r\nYes, there _was_ one who had not yet declared himself; nor did he do so\r\nuntil some time had elapsed after the final and disappointing draw made\r\nby the master of the ceremonies.  This man was Larry O'Gorman.\r\n\r\nWhile the rest of the crew had been listening to the arguments of the\r\nFrenchman's confederate,--and one by one signifying their\r\nacquiescence,--the Irishman stood apart, apparently busied in some\r\nprofound mental calculation.\r\n\r\nWhen at length all seemed to have consented to a second casting of lots,\r\nhe roused himself from his reverie; and, stepping hastily into their\r\nmidst, cried out in a determined manner, \"No--\r\n\r\n\"No, yez don't,\" continued he, \"no more drawin', my jewels, till we've\r\nhad a betther undherstandin' ov this little matther.  That there's been\r\nchatin' yez are all agreed; only yez can't identify the chate.  Maybe I\r\ncan say somethin' to point out the dirty spalpeen as hasn't the courage\r\nnor the dacency to take his chance along wid the rest ov us.\"\r\n\r\nThis unexpected interpolation at once drew the eyes of all parties upon\r\nthe speaker; for all were alike interested in the revelation which\r\nO'Gorman was threatening to make.\r\n\r\nWhoever had played foul,--if it could only be proved against him,--would\r\nbe regarded as the man who ought to have drawn the red button; and would\r\nbe treated as if he had done so.  This was tacitly understood; even\r\nbefore the suggestion of such a course had passed the lips of anyone.\r\nThose who were innocent were of course desirous of discovering the\r\n\"black sheep,\"--in order to escape the danger of a second drawing,--and,\r\nas these comprehended almost the entire crew, it was natural that an\r\nattentive ear should be given to the statement which the Irishman\r\nproposed to lay before them.\r\n\r\nAll stood gazing upon him with expectant eyes.  In those of Le Gros and\r\nhis confederate there was a different expression.  The look of the\r\nFrenchman was more especially remarkable.  His jaws had fallen; his lips\r\nwere white and bloodless; his eyes glared fiend-like out of their sunken\r\nsockets; while the whole cast of his features was that of a man\r\nthreatened with some fearful and infamous fate, which he feels himself\r\nunable to avert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nLE GROS UPON TRIAL.\r\n\r\nAs O'Gorman gave utterance to the last words of his preparatory speech,\r\nhe fixed his eyes steadfastly upon the Frenchman.  His look confirmed\r\nevery one in the belief that the allusion had been to the latter.\r\n\r\nLe Gros at first quailed before the Irishman's glance; but, perceiving\r\nthe necessity of putting a bold front on the matter, he made an\r\nendeavour to reciprocate it.\r\n\r\n\"_Sacre bleu_!\" he exclaimed.  \"_Monsieur Irlandais_ why do you look at\r\nme? you don't mean to insinuate that I've acted unfairly?\"\r\n\r\n\"The divil a bit,\" replied the Irishman.  \"If it's insinivation yez be\r\ntalkin' about, the divil a bit ov that do I mane.  Larry O'Gorman isn't\r\nagoin' to bate about the bush wan way or the tother, Misther Laygrow.\r\nHe tells ye to yer teeth that it was yer beautiful self putt the exthra\r\nbutton into the bag,--yez did it, Misther Laygrow, and nobody else.\"\r\n\r\n\"Liar!\" vociferated the Frenchman, with a menacing gesture.  \"Liar!\"\r\n\r\n\"Kape cool, Frenchy.  It isn't Larry the Galwayman that's goin' to be\r\nscared at yer blusther.  I repate,--it was you yourself that putt that\r\nbutton into the bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know that, O'Gorman?\"  \"Can you prove it?\"\r\n\r\n\"What proof have you?\" were questions that were asked simultaneously by\r\nseveral voices,--among which that of the Frenchman's confederate was\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\n\"Phwy, phwat more proof do yez want, than phwat's alriddy before yez?\r\nWhen I had me hand in the wallet, there wasn't only the two buttons,--\r\nthe divil a more.  I feeled thim both while I was gropin' about to make\r\nchoice betwixt them; an if there had been a third, I wud a feeled that\r\ntoo.  I can swear by the holy cross of Saint Pathrick there wasn't wan\r\nmore than the two.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's no proof there wasn't three,\" urged the friend of Le Gros.  \"The\r\nthird might have been in a wrinkle of the bag, without your feeling it!\"\r\n\r\n\"The divil a wrinkle it was in, except the wrinkles in the palm of that\r\nspalpeen's fist!  That's where it was; and I can tell yez all who putt\r\nit there.  It was this very chap who is so pit-a-pat at explainin' it.\r\nYez needn't deny it, Bill Bowler.  I saw somethin' passin' betwixt\r\nyerself and Frenchy,--jest before it come his turn to dhraw.  I saw yer\r\nflippers touchin' van another, an' somethin' slippin' in betwane them.\r\nI couldn't tell phwat it was, but, by Jaysus!  I thought it quare for\r\nall that.  I know now phwhat it was,--it was the button.\"\r\n\r\nThe Irishman's arguments merited attention; and received it.  The\r\ncircumstances looked at the least suspicious against Le Gros.  To the\r\nmajority they were conclusive of his guilt.\r\n\r\nThe accusation was supported by other evidence.  The man who had\r\npreceded O'Gorman in the drawing positively avowed that he could feel\r\nonly three buttons in the bag; while the one before him, with equal\r\nconfidence, asserted that when _he_ drew, there were but four.  Both\r\ndeclared that they could not be mistaken as to the numbers.  They had\r\nseparately \"fingered\" each button in the hope of being able to detect\r\nthat which was bloodstained, and so avoid bringing it forth.\r\n\r\n\"Ach!\" ejaculated the Irishman, becoming impatient for the conviction of\r\nhis guilty antagonist; \"phwat's the use ov talkin'.  Frenchy's the wan\r\nthat did it.  That gropin' an fumblin' about the bottom of the wallet\r\nwas all pretince.  He had the button in his shut fist all the time, an'\r\nby Jaysus! he's entitled to the prize, the same as if he had dhrawn it.\r\nIt's him that's got to die!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Canaille_! liar!\" shouted Le Gros; \"if I have, you--\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the words issued from his lips he sprang forward, knife in hand,\r\nwith the evident design of taking the life of his accuser.\r\n\r\n\"Kape cool!\" cried the latter, springing out of reach of his assailant;\r\nand with his own blade bared, placing himself on the defensive.  \"Kape\r\ncool, ye frog-atin' son av a gun, or ye'll make mate for us sooner than\r\nye expected, ay, before yez have time to put up a _pater_ for yer ugly\r\nsowl, that stans most disperately in nade ov it.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued the Irishman, after he had fairly placed himself in an\r\nattitude of defence; \"come an whiniver yer loike.  Larry O'Gorman is\r\nriddy for ye, an' another av the same at yer dhirty back.\r\n_Hoch_,--_faugh-a-ballah_,--_hiloo_,--_whallabaloo_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nA DUEL TO THE DEATH.\r\n\r\nThe strange ceremonial upon the raft,--hitherto carried on with some\r\nshow of solemnity,--had reached an unexpected crisis.\r\n\r\nA second appeal to the goddess of Fortune was no longer thought of.  The\r\ndeadly antagonism of the two chief castaways--Le Gros and O'Gorman--\r\npromised a result likely to supply the larder of that cannibal crew,\r\nwithout the necessity of their having recourse to her decrees.\r\n\r\nOne or other,--perhaps both,--of these men must soon cease to live; for\r\nthe determined attitude of each told, beyond mistaking, that his bared\r\nblade would not be again sheathed, except in the flesh of his adversary.\r\n\r\nThere was no attempt at intervention.  Not one of their comrades\r\ninterposed to keep them apart.  There was friendly feeling,--or, to use\r\na more appropriate phrase, partisanship,--on the side of each; but it\r\nwas of that character which usually exists among the brutal backers of\r\ntwo \"champions of the ring.\"\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances, each party might have regretted the defeat of\r\nthe champion they had adopted; but upon that raft, the death of one or\r\nother of the combatants was not only desirable; but, rather than it\r\nshould not occur, either side would have most gladly assented to see its\r\nespecial favourite the victim.\r\n\r\nEvery man of that ruffian crew had a selfish interest in the result of\r\nthe threatened conflict; and this far outweighed any feeling of\r\npartisanship with which he might have been inspired.  A few may have\r\nfelt friendlier than others towards their respective champions; but to\r\nthe majority it mattered little which of the two men should die; and\r\nthere were even some who, in the secret chambers of their hearts, would\r\nhave reflected gleefully to behold both become victims of their\r\nreciprocal hostility.  Such a result would cause a still further\r\npostponement of that unpopular lottery,--in which they had been too\r\noften compelled to take shares.\r\n\r\nThere was no very great difference in the number of the \"friends\" on\r\neither side.  The partisans of the Frenchman would have far outnumbered\r\nthose of his Irish adversary, but ten minutes before.  But the behaviour\r\nof Le Gros in the lottery had lost him many adherents.  That he had\r\nplayed the trick imputed to him was by most believed; and as the result\r\nof his unmanly subterfuge was of personal interest to all, there were\r\nmany, hitherto indifferent, now inspired with hostility towards him.\r\n\r\nApart from personal considerations,--even amongst that conglomeration of\r\noutcasts,--there were some in whom the instinct of \"fair-play\" was not\r\naltogether dead; and the foul play of the Frenchman had freshly aroused\r\nthis instinct within them.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the combatants had shown a fixed determination to engage in\r\ndeadly strife, the crowd upon the raft became separated, as if by\r\nmechanical action, into two groups,--one forming in the rear of Le Gros,\r\nthe other taking stand behind the Irishman.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, there was no great inequality between them in point\r\nof numbers; and as each occupied an end of the raft, the balance was\r\npreserved, and the stage upon which the death drama was about to be\r\nenacted--set horizontally--offered no advantage to either.\r\n\r\nKnives were to be their weapons.  There were others on the raft.  There\r\nwere axes, cutlasses, and harpoons; but the use of these was prohibited\r\nto either of the intended combatants: as nothing could be fairer than\r\nthe sailor's knife,--with which each was provided,--and no weapon in\r\nclose combat could be used with more certain or deadlier effect.\r\n\r\nEach armed with his own knife, released from its lanyard fastenings in\r\norder to be freely handled,--each with his foot planted in front of him,\r\nto guard against the onset of his adversary,--each with an arm upraised,\r\nat the end of which appeared six inches of sharp, glittering steel,--\r\neach with muscles braced to their toughest tension, and eyes glaring\r\nforth the fires of a mutual hatred,--a hostility to end only in death,--\r\nsuch became the attitude of the antagonists.\r\n\r\nBehind each stood their respective partisans, in a sort of semicircle,\r\nof which the champion was in the centre,--all eagerly intent on watching\r\nthe movements of the two men, one of whom--perhaps both--was about to be\r\nhurried into eternity.\r\n\r\nIt was a setting sun that was to afford light for this fearful conflict.\r\nAlready was the golden orb declining low upon the western horizon.  His\r\ndisc was of a lurid red,--a colour appropriate to the spectacle it was\r\nto illumine.  No wonder that both combatants instinctively turned their\r\neyes towards the west, and gazed upon the god of day.  Both were under\r\nthe belief they might never more look upon that luminary!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nHATE AGAINST HATE.\r\n\r\nThe combatants did not close on the instant.  The sharp blades shining\r\nin their hands rendered them shy of a too near approach, and for some\r\ntime they kept apart.  They did not, however, remain motionless or\r\ninactive.  On the contrary, both were on the alert,--moving in short\r\ncurves from one side to the other, and all the while keeping\r\n_vis-a-vis_.\r\n\r\nAt irregular intervals one of them would make a feint to attack; or by\r\nfeigning a retreat endeavour to get the other off guard; but, after\r\nseveral such passes and counter-passes had been delivered between them,\r\nstill not a scratch had been given,--not a drop of blood drawn.\r\n\r\nThe spectators looked on with a curious interest.  Some showed not the\r\nslightest emotion,--as if they cared not who should be the victor, or\r\nwhich the victim.  To most it mattered but little if both should fall;\r\nand there were even some upon the raft who, for certain secret reasons,\r\nwould have preferred such a termination to the sanguinary struggle.\r\n\r\nA few there were slightly affected with feelings of partisanship.  These\r\ndoubtless felt a deeper interest in the result, at least they were more\r\ndemonstrative of it; and by words of exhortation and cries of\r\nencouragement endeavoured to give support to their respective champions.\r\n\r\nThere were spectators of a different kind, that appeared to take as much\r\ninterest in the fearful affair as any of those already described.  These\r\nwere the sharks!  Looking at them, as they swam around the raft,--their\r\neyes glaring upon those who occupied it,--one could not have helped\r\nthinking that they comprehended what was going on,--that they were\r\nconscious of a deed of violence about to be enacted,--and were waiting\r\nfor some contingency that might turn up in their favour!\r\n\r\nWhatever the crisis was to be, neither the spectators _in_ the sea, nor\r\nthose _upon_ it, would have long to wait for the crisis.  Two men,\r\nmutually enraged, standing in front of each other, armed with naked\r\nknives; each desperately desirous of killing the other,--with no one to\r\nkeep them apart, but a score of spectators to encourage them in their\r\nintent of reciprocal destruction,--were not likely to be long in coming\r\nto the end of the affair.  It was not a question of swords, where\r\nskilful fencing may protract a combat to an indefinite period of time;\r\nnor of pistols, where unskilful shooting may equally retard the result.\r\nThe combatants knew that, on closing within arms' length, one or other\r\nmust receive a wound that might in a moment prove mortal.\r\n\r\nIt was this thought that--for some minutes after their squaring up to\r\neach other--had influenced them to keep at a wary distance.\r\n\r\nThe cries of their companions began to assume an altered tone.  Mingled\r\nwith shouts of exhortation could be heard taunts and jeers,--several\r\nvoices proclaiming that the \"two bullies were afraid of each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go in, Le Gros! give him the knife!\" cried the partisans of the\r\nFrenchman.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Larry! lay on to him!\" shouted the backers of his antagonist.\r\n\r\n\"Bear a hand, both of you! go it like men!\" vociferated the voice of\r\nsome one, who did not seem particularly affected to the side of either.\r\n\r\nThese off-hand counsels, spoken in a varied vocabulary of tongues,\r\nseemed to produce the desired effect.  As the last of them pealed over\r\nthe heads of the spectators, the combatants rushed towards each other,--\r\nas they closed inflicting a mutual stab.  But the blade of each was met\r\nby the left arm of his antagonist, thrown out to ward off the strokes\r\nand they separated again without either having received further injury\r\nthan a flesh wound, that in no way disabled them.  It appeared, however,\r\nto produce an irritation, which rendered both of them less careful of\r\nconsequences: for in an instant after they closed again,--the spectators\r\naccompanying their collision with shouts of encouragement.\r\n\r\nAll were now looking for a quick termination to the affair; but in this\r\nthey were disappointed.  After several random thrusts had been given on\r\nboth sides, the combatants again became separated without either having\r\nreceived any serious injury.  The wild rage which blinded both,\r\nrendering their blows uncertain,--combined with the weakness of their\r\nbodies from long starvation,--may account for their thus separating for\r\nthe second time, without either having received a mortal wound.\r\n\r\nEqually innocuous proved the third encounter,--though differing in\r\ncharacter from either of those that preceded it.  As they came together,\r\neach grasped the right arm of his antagonist,--that which wielded the\r\nweapon,--in his left hand; and firmly holding one another by the wrists,\r\nthey continued the strife.  In this way it was no longer a contest of\r\nskill, but of strength.  Nor was it at all dangerous, as long as the\r\n\"grip\" held good; since neither could use his knife.  Either could have\r\nlet go with his left hand at any moment; but by so doing he would\r\nrelease the _armed_ hand of his antagonist, and thus place himself in\r\nimminent peril.\r\n\r\nBoth were conscious of the danger; and, instead of separating, they\r\ncontinued to preserve the reciprocal \"clutch\" that had been established\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes they struggled in this strange fashion,--the intention\r\nof each being to throw the other upon the raft.  That done, he who\r\nshould be uppermost would obtain a decided advantage.\r\n\r\nThey twisted, and turned, and wriggled their bodies about; but both\r\nstill managed to keep upon their feet.\r\n\r\nThe contest was not carried on in any particular spot, but all over the\r\nraft; up against the mast, around the empty casks, among the osseous\r\nrelics of humanity,--the strewed bones rattling against their feet as\r\nthey trod over them.  The spectators made way as they came nearer,\r\nnimbly leaping from side to side; while the stage upon which this\r\nfearful drama was being enacted,--despite the ballast of its\r\nwater-logged beams, and the buoyancy of its empty casks,--was kept in a\r\ncontinual commotion.\r\n\r\nIt soon became evident that Le Gros was likely to get the worst of it,\r\nin this trial of strength.  The muscular power of the Frenchman was\r\ninferior to that of his island antagonist; and had it been a mere\r\ncontest of toughness, the former would have been defeated.\r\n\r\nIn craft, however, Le Gros was the Irishman's superior: and at this\r\ncrisis stratagem came to his aid.\r\n\r\nIn turning about, the Frenchman had got his head close to the sleeve of\r\nO'Gorman's jacket,--that one which encircled his right wrist, and\r\ntouched the hand holding the dangerous knife.  Suddenly craning his neck\r\nto its fullest stretch, he seized the sleeve between his teeth, and held\r\nit with all the strength of his powerful jaws.  Quick as thought, his\r\nleft hand glided towards his own right; his knife was transferred to it;\r\nand the next moment gleamed beneath, threatening to penetrate the bosom\r\nof his antagonist.\r\n\r\nO'Gorman's fate appeared to be sealed.  With both arms pinioned, what\r\nchance had he to avoid the blow?  The spectators, silent and breathless,\r\nlooked for it as a certain thing.  There was scarce time for them to\r\nutter an exclamation, before they were again subjected to surprise at\r\nseeing the Irishman escape from his perilous position.\r\n\r\nFortunate it was for him, that the cloth of his pea-jacket was not of\r\nthe best quality.  It had never been, even when new; and now, after\r\nlong-continued and ill-usage, it _was_ almost rotten.  For this reason,\r\nby a desperate wrench, he was enabled to release his arm from the dental\r\ngrip which his antagonist had taken upon it,--leaving only a rag between\r\nthe Frenchman's teeth.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances had suddenly changed! the advantage being now on the\r\nside of the Irishman.  Not only was his right arm free again; but with\r\nthe other he still retained his hold upon that of his antagonist.  Le\r\nGros could only use his weapon with the left arm; which placed him at a\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe shouts that had gone up to hail the Frenchman's success--so late\r\nappearing certain--had become suddenly hushed; and once more the contest\r\nproceeded in silence.\r\n\r\nIt lasted but a few seconds longer; and then was it terminated in a\r\nmanner unexpected by all.\r\n\r\nBeyond doubt, O'Gorman would have been the victor, had it ended as every\r\none was anticipating it would,--in the death of one or other of the\r\ncombatants.  As it chanced, however, neither succumbed in that\r\nsanguinary strife.  Both were preserved for a fate equally fearful: one,\r\nindeed, for a death ten times more terrible.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, the circumstances had turned in favour of the Irishman.\r\nHe knew it; and was not slow to avail himself of the advantage.\r\n\r\nStill retaining his grasp of Le Gros's right wrist, he plied his own\r\ndexter arm with a vigour that promised soon to settle the affair; while\r\nthe left arm of the Frenchman could offer only a feeble resistance,\r\neither by thrusting or parrying.\r\n\r\nTheir knife-blades came frequently in collision; and for a few passes\r\nneither appeared to give or receive a wound.  This innocuous sparring,\r\nhowever, was of short continuance and ended by the Irishman making a\r\ndexterous stroke, by which his blade was planted in the hand of his\r\nantagonist,--transfixing the very fingers which were grasping the knife!\r\n\r\nThe weapon fell from his relaxed clutch; and passing through the\r\ninterstices of the timber, sank to the bottom of the sea!  A scream of\r\ndespair escaped from the lips of the Frenchman, as he saw the blade of\r\nhis antagonist about to be thrust into his body!\r\n\r\nThe thrust was threatened, but not made.  Before it could be given, a\r\nhand interfered to prevent it.  One of the spectators had seized the\r\nuplifted arm of the Irishman,--at the same time vociferating, in a\r\nstentorian voice--\r\n\r\n\"Don't kill him! we won't need to eat him!  Look yonder!  We're saved!\r\nwe're saved!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nA LIGHT!\r\n\r\nThe man who had so unexpectedly interrupted the deadly duello, while\r\ngiving utterance to his strange speech, kept one of his arms extended\r\ntowards the ocean,--as if pointing to something he had descried above\r\nthe horizon.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of all were suddenly turned in the direction thus indicated.\r\nThe magic words, \"We are saved!\" had an immediate effect,--not only upon\r\nthe spectators of the tragedy thus intruded upon, but upon its actors.\r\nEven rancour became appeased by the sweet sound; and that of the\r\nIrishman, as with most of his countrymen, being born \"as the flint bears\r\nfire,\" subsided on the instant.\r\n\r\nHe permitted his upraised arm to be held in restraint; it became\r\nrelaxed, as did also his grasp on the wrist of his antagonist; while the\r\nlatter, finding himself free, was allowed to retire from the contest.\r\n\r\nO'Gorman, among the rest, had faced round; and stood looking in the\r\ndirection where somebody had seen something that promised salvation of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" inquired several voices in the same breath,--\"the land?\"\r\n\r\nNo: it could not be that.  There was not one of them such a nautical\r\nignoramus as to believe himself within sigh of land.\r\n\r\n\"A sail?--a ship?\"\r\n\r\nThat was more likely: though, at the first glance, neither tail nor ship\r\nappeared upon the horizon, \"What is it?\" was the interrogatory\r\nreiterated by a dozen voices.\r\n\r\n\"A light!  Don't you see it?\" asked the lynx-eyed individual, whose\r\ninterference in the combat had caused this sudden departure from the\r\nprogramme.  \"Look!\" he continued; \"just where the sun's gone down\r\nyonder.  It's only a speck; but I can see it plain enough.  It must be\r\nthe light from a ship's binnacle!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Carrajo_!\" exclaimed a Spaniard; \"it's only a spark the sun's left\r\nbehind him.  It's the _ignis fatuus_ you've seen, _amigo_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" added another; \"supposing it is a binnacle-lamp, as you say, what\r\nwould be the use, except to tantalise us.  If it be in the binnacle, in\r\ncourse the ship as carries it must be stern towards us.  What chance\r\nwould there be of our overhaulin' her?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Par Dieu_! there be von light!\" cried a sharp-eyed little Frenchman.\r\n\"Pe Gar!  I him see.  Ver true, vraiment!  An--pe dam!--zat same est no\r\nlamp in ze binnacle!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see it too!\" cried another.\r\n\r\n\"And I!\" added a third.\r\n\r\n\"_Io tambien_!\"  (I also) echoed a fourth, whose tongue proclaimed him\r\nof Spanish nativity.\r\n\r\n\"_Ich sehe_!\" drawled out a native of the German Confederacy; and then\r\nfollowed a volley of voices,--each saying something to confirm the\r\nbelief that a light was really gleaming over the ocean.\r\n\r\nThis was a fact that nobody--not even the first objectors--any longer\r\ndoubted.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the light seen appeared only a mere sparkle, feebly\r\nglimmering against the sky, and might have been mistaken for a star.\r\nBut it was just in that part of the heavens where a star could not at\r\nthat time have been seen,--on the western horizon, still slightly\r\nreddened by the rays of the declining sun.\r\n\r\nThe men who speculated upon its appearance,--rude as they were in a\r\nmoral sense,--were not so intellectually stupid as to mistake for a star\r\nthat speck of yellowish hue, struggling to reveal itself against the\r\nalmost kindred colour of the occidental sky.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a star,--that's certain,\" confidently declared one of their\r\nnumber; \"and if it be a light aboard ship, it's no binnacle-lamp, I say.\r\nBah! who'd call that a binnacle glim, or a lamp of any kind?  If't be a\r\nship's light at all, it's the glare o' the galley-fire,--where the\r\ncook's makin' coffee for all hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe superb picture of comfort thus called forth was too much for the\r\ntemper of the starving men, to whom the idea was addressed; and a wild\r\ncry of exultation responded to the speech.\r\n\r\nA galley; a galley-fire; a cook; coffee for all hands; lobscouse;\r\nplum-duff; sea-pies; even the much-despised pea-soup and salt junk, had\r\nbeen long looked upon as things belonging to another world,--pleasures\r\nof the past, never more to be indulged in!\r\n\r\nNow that the gleam of a galley-fire--as they believed the light to be--\r\nrose up before their eyes, the spirits of all became suddenly\r\nelectrified by the wildest imaginings; and the contest so lately carried\r\non,--as well as the combatants engaged in it,--was instantaneously\r\nforgotten; while the thoughts, and eager glances, of every individual on\r\nthe raft were now directed towards that all-absorbing speck,--still\r\ngleaming but obscurely against the reddish background of the sun-stained\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nAs they continued to gaze, the tiny spark seemed to increase, not only\r\nin size, but intensity; and, before many minutes had elapsed, it\r\nproclaimed itself no longer a mere spark, but a blaze of light, with its\r\nown luminous halo around it.  The gradual chastening of colour in the\r\nwestern sky, along with the increased darkness of the atmosphere around\r\nit, would account for this change in the appearance of the light.  So\r\nreasoned the spectators,--now more than ever convinced that what they\r\nsaw was the glare of a galley-fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTOWARDS THE BEACON!\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were satisfied that the bright spark upon the horizon\r\nwas a burning light, every individual on the raft became inspired with\r\nthe same impulse,--to make for the spot where the object appeared.\r\nWhether in the galley or not,--and whether the glow of a fire or the\r\ngleam of a lamp,--it must be on board a ship.  There was no land in that\r\npart of the ocean; and a light could not be burning upon the water,\r\nwithout something in the shape of a ship to carry it.\r\n\r\nThat it was a ship, no one for a moment doubted.  So sure were they,\r\nthat several of the men, on the moment of making it out, had\r\nvociferated, at the top of their voices, \"Ship ahoy!\"\r\n\r\nThe voices of none of them were particularly strong just then.  They\r\nwere weak, in proportion to their attenuated frames; but had they been\r\nten times as strong as they were, they could not have been heard at such\r\na distance as that light was separated from the raft.\r\n\r\nIt was not less than twenty miles from them.  In the excited state of\r\ntheir senses,--arising from thirst, starvation, and all the wild\r\nemotions which the discovery itself had roused within them,--they had\r\nformed a delusive idea of the distance; many of them fancying that the\r\nlight was quite near!\r\n\r\nThere were some among them who reasoned more rationally.  These, instead\r\nof wasting their strength in idle shouting, employed their time in\r\nimpressing upon the others the necessity of making some exertion to\r\napproach the light.\r\n\r\nSome thought that much exertion would not be required; as the light\r\nappeared to be approaching them.  And, in truth, it did appear so; but\r\nthe wiser ones knew that this might be only an optical illusion,--caused\r\nby the sea and sky each moment assuming a more sombre hue.\r\n\r\nThese last--both with voice and by their example--urged their companions\r\nto use every effort towards coming up with what they were sure must be a\r\nship.\r\n\r\n\"Let us meet her,\" they said, \"if she's standing this way; if not, we\r\nmust do all we can to overtake her.\"\r\n\r\nIt needed no persuasion to put the most slothful of the crew upon their\r\nmettle.  A new hope of life,--an unexpected prospect of being rescued\r\nfrom what most of them had been contemplating as almost certain death,--\r\ninspired all to the utmost effort; and with an alacrity they had never\r\nbefore exhibited in their raft navigation,--and a unanimity of late\r\nunknown to them,--they went to work to propel their clumsy craft across\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nSome sprang to the oars, while others assisted at the sail.  For days\r\nthe latter had received no attention; but had been permitted to hang\r\nloosely from the mast,--flopping about in whatever way the breeze\r\nchanced to blow it.  They had entertained no idea of what course they\r\nought to steer in; or if they did think of a direction, they had not\r\nsufficient decision to follow it.  For days they had been drifting about\r\nover the surface of the sea, at the discretion of the currents.\r\n\r\nNow the sail was reset, with all the trimness that circumstances would\r\nadmit of.  The sheets were drawn home and made fast; and the mast was\r\nstayed _taut_, so as to hinder it from slanting.\r\n\r\nAs the object upon which they were directing their course was not\r\nexactly to leeward, it was necessary to manage the sail with the wind\r\nslightly abeam; and for this purpose two men were appointed to the\r\nrudder,--which consisted of a broad plank, poised on its edge and\r\nhitched to the stern timbers of the raft.  By means of this rude rudder,\r\nthey were enabled to keep the raft \"head on\" towards the light.\r\n\r\nThe rowers were seated along both sides.  Nearly every individual of the\r\ncrew, who was not occupied at the sail or steering-board, was employed\r\nin propelling.  A few only were provided with oars; others wielded\r\nhandspikes, capstan-bars, or pieces of split plank,--in short, anything\r\nthat would assist in the \"pulling,\" if only to the value of a pound.\r\n\r\nIt was,--or, at all events, they thought it was,--a life and death\r\nstruggle.  They were sure that a ship was near them.  By reaching her\r\nthey would be saved; by failing to do so they would be doomed.  Another\r\nday without food would bring death, at least to one of them; another day\r\nwithout water would bring worse than death to almost every man of them.\r\n\r\nTheir unanimous action, assisted by the broad sail, caused the craft,\r\ncumbersome as it was, to make considerable way through the water,--\r\nthough by far too slow to satisfy their wishes.  At times they kept\r\nsilent; at times their voices could be heard mingled with the plunging\r\nof the oars; and too often only in profane speech.\r\n\r\nThey cursed the craft upon which they were carried,--its clumsiness,--\r\nthe slowness with which they were making way towards the ship,--the ship\r\nitself, for not making way towards them: for, as they continued on,\r\nthose who formerly believed that the light was approaching them, no\r\nlonger held to that faith.  On the contrary, after rowing nearly an\r\nhour, all were too ready to agree in the belief that the ship was\r\nwearing away.\r\n\r\nNot an instant passed, without the eyes of some one being directed\r\ntowards the light.  The rowers, whose backs were turned upon it, kept\r\noccasionally twisting their necks around, and looking over their\r\nshoulders,--only to resume their proper attitudes with countenances that\r\nexpressed disappointment.\r\n\r\nThere were not wanting voices to speak discouragement.  Some declared\r\nthat the light was growing less; that the ship was in full sail, going\r\naway from them; and that there would not be the slightest chance of\r\ntheir coming up with her.\r\n\r\nThese were men who began to feel fatigued at the oar.\r\n\r\nThere were even some who professed to doubt the existence of a ship, or\r\na ship's light.  What they saw was only a bright spot upon the ocean,--\r\nsome luminous object--perhaps the carcass of some phosphorous fish, or\r\n\"squid,\" floating upon the surface.  They had many of them seen such\r\nthings; and the conjecture was not offered to incredulous ears.\r\n\r\nThese surmises produced discontent,--which in time would have exhibited\r\nitself in the gradual dropping of the oars, but for a circumstance which\r\nbrought this climax about, in a more sudden and simultaneous manner,--\r\nthe _extinction of the light_.\r\n\r\nIt went out while the eyes of several were fixed upon it; not by any\r\ngradual disappearance,--as a waning star might have passed out of\r\nsight,--but with a quick \"fluff;\"--so one of the spectators described\r\nit,--likening its extinction to \"a tub of salt-water thrown over the\r\ngalley-fire.\"\r\n\r\nOn the instant of its disappearance, the oars were abandoned,--as also\r\nthe rudder.  It would have been idle to attempt steering any longer.\r\nThere was neither moon nor stars in the sky.  The light was the only\r\nthing that had been guiding them; and that gone, they had not the\r\nslightest clue as to their course.  The breeze was buffeting about in\r\nevery direction; but, even had it been blowing steadily, every one of\r\nthem knew how uncertain it would be to trust to its guidance,--\r\nespecially with such a sail, and such a steering apparatus.\r\n\r\nAlready half convinced that they had been following an _ignis fatuus_,--\r\nand half resolved to give over the pursuit,--it needed only what had\r\noccurred to cause a complete abandonment of their nocturnal navigation.\r\n\r\nOnce more giving way to despair,--expressed in wild wicked words,--they\r\nleft the sail to itself, and the winds to waft them to whatever spot of\r\nthe ocean fate had designed for the closing scene of their wretched\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nA DOUBLE DARKNESS.\r\n\r\nThe night was a dark one; by a Spanish figure of speech, comparable to a\r\n\"pot of pitch.\"  It was scarce further obscured by a thick fog that\r\nshortly after came silently over the surface of the ocean, enveloping\r\nthe great raft along with its ruffian crew.\r\n\r\nThrough such an atmosphere nothing could be seen,--not even the light,\r\nhad it continued to burn.\r\n\r\nBefore the coming on of the fog, they had kept a look-out for the\r\nlight,--one or other remaining always on the watch.  They had done so,\r\nwith a sort of despairing hope that it might reappear; but, as the\r\nsurrounding atmosphere became impregnated with the filmy vapour, this\r\ndreary vigilance was gradually relaxed, and at length abandoned\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nSo thick fell the fog during the mid-hours of the night, that nothing\r\ncould be seen at the distance of over six feet from the eye.  Even they\r\nwho occupied the raft could only distinguish those who were close by\r\ntheir side; and each appeared to the others as if shrouded under a\r\nscreen of grey gauze.\r\n\r\nThe darkness did not hinder them from conversing.  As nearly all hope of\r\nsuccour from a supposed ship had been extinguished, along with that\r\nfanciful light, it was but natural that their thoughts should lapse into\r\nsome other channel; and equally so, that they should turn back to that\r\nfrom which they had been so unexpectedly diverted.\r\n\r\nHunger,--keen, craving hunger,--easily transported them to the spectacle\r\nwhich the sheen of that false torch had brought to an unsatisfactory\r\ntermination; and their minds now dwelt on what would have been the\r\ndifferent condition of affairs, had they not yielded to the delusion.\r\n\r\nNot only had their thoughts reference to this theme, but their speeches;\r\nand in the solemn hour of midnight,--in the midst of that gloomy vapour,\r\ndarkly overshadowing the great deep,--they might have been heard again\r\ndiscussing the awful question, \"Who dies next?\"\r\n\r\nTo arrive at a decision was not so difficult as before.  The majority of\r\nthe men had made up their minds as to the course that should be pursued.\r\nIt was no longer a question of casting lots.  That had been done\r\nalready; and the two who had not yet drawn clear--and between whom the\r\nthing still remained undecided--were undoubtedly the individuals to\r\ndetermine the matter.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there was no debate.  All were unanimous that either Le Gros or\r\nO'Gorman should furnish food for their famishing companions,--in other\r\nwords, that the combat, so unexpectedly postponed, should be again\r\nresumed.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing unfair in this,--except to the Irish man.  He had\r\ncertainly secured his triumph, when interrupted.  If another half-second\r\nhad been allowed him, his antagonist would have lain lifeless at his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nUnder the judgment of just umpires this circumstance would have weighed\r\nin his favour; and, perhaps, exempted him from any further risk; but,\r\ntried by the shipwrecked crew of a slaver,--more than a moiety of whom\r\nleaned towards his antagonist,--the sentence was different; and the\r\nmajority of the judges proclaimed that the combat between him and Le\r\nGros should be renewed, and continued to the death.\r\n\r\nThe renewal of it was not to take place on the moment.  Night and\r\ndarkness both forbade this; but the morning's earliest light was to\r\nwitness the resumption of that terrible strife.\r\n\r\nThus resolved, the ex-crew of the _Pandora_ laid themselves down to\r\nsleep,--not quite so calmly as they might have done in the forecastle of\r\nthe slaver; for thirst, hunger, and fears for a hopeless future,--\r\nwithout saying anything of a hard couch,--were not the companions with\r\nwhich to approach the shrine of Somnus.  As a counterpoise, they felt\r\nlassitude both of mind and body, approaching to prostration.\r\n\r\nSome of them slept.  Some of them could have slept within the portals of\r\nPluto, with the dog Cerberus yelping in their ears!\r\n\r\nA few there were who seemed either unable to take rest or indifferent to\r\nit.  All night long some one or other--sometimes two at a time--might be\r\nseen staggering about the raft, or crawling over its planks, as if\r\nunconscious of what they were doing.  It seemed a wonder that some of\r\nthem--semi-somnambulists in a double sense--did not fall overboard into\r\nthe water.  But they did not.  Notwithstanding the eccentricity of their\r\nmovements, they all succeeded in maintaining their position on the raft.\r\nTo tumble over the edge would have been tantamount to toppling into the\r\njaws of an expectant shark, and getting \"scrunched\" between no less than\r\nsix rows of sharp teeth.  Perhaps it was an instinct--or some\r\npresentiment of this peril--that enabled these wakeful wanderers to\r\npreserve their equilibrium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA WHISPERED CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\nAlthough most of the men had surrendered themselves to such slumber as\r\nthey might obtain, the silence was neither profound nor continuous.  At\r\ntimes no sounds were heard save the whisperings of the breeze, as it\r\nbrushed against the spread canvas, or a slight \"swashing\" in the water\r\nas it was broken by the rough timbers of the craft.\r\n\r\nThese sounds were intermingled with the loud breathing of some of the\r\nsleepers,--an occasional snore,--and now and then a muttered speech the\r\ninvoluntary utterance of someone dreaming a dreadful dream.\r\n\r\nAt intervals other noises would arise, when one or more of the waking\r\ncastaways chanced to come together, to hold a short conversation; or\r\nwhen one of them, scarce conscious of what he did, stumbled over the\r\nlimbs of a prostrate comrade,--perhaps awaking him from a pleasant\r\nrepose to the consciousness of the painful circumstances under which he\r\nhad been enjoying it.\r\n\r\nSuch occurrences usually led to angry altercations,--in which threats\r\nand ribald language would for some minutes freely find vent from the\r\nlips both of the disturbed and the disturber; and then both would\r\ngrowlingly subside into silence.\r\n\r\nAt that hour, when the night was at its darkest, and the fog at its\r\nthickest, two men might have been seen,--though only by an eye very\r\nclose to where they were,--in a sitting posture at the bottom of the\r\nmast.  They were crouching rather than seated; for they were upon their\r\nknees, with their bodies bent forward, and one or both of their hands\r\nresting upon the planks.\r\n\r\nThe attitude was plainly not one of repose; and anyone near enough to\r\nhave observed the two men, or to have heard the whispered conversation\r\nthat was being carried on between them, would have come to the\r\nconclusion that sleep was far from their thoughts.\r\n\r\nIn that deep darkness, however, no one noticed them; and although\r\nseveral of their companions were lying but a few feet from the bottom of\r\nthe mast, these were either asleep or too distant to hear the\r\nwhisperings that passed between the two men kneeling in juxtaposition.\r\n\r\nThey continued to talk in very low whispers,--each in turn putting his\r\nlips close to the ear of the other; and while doing so the subject of\r\ntheir conversation might have been guessed at by their glances, or at\r\nleast the individual about whom they conversed.\r\n\r\nThis was a man who was lying stretched along the timbers, not far from\r\nthe bottom of the mast, and apparently asleep.  In fact he must have\r\nbeen asleep, as was testified by the stentorian snores that occasionally\r\nescaped from his wide-spread nostrils.\r\n\r\nThis noisy slumberer was the Irishman, O'Gorman,--one of the parties to\r\nthat suspended fight, to be resumed by day break in the morning.\r\nWhatever evil deeds this man may have done during his life,--and he had\r\nperformed not a few, for we have styled him only the least guilty of\r\nthat guilty crew,--he was certainly no coward.  Thus to sleep, with such\r\na prospect on awaking, at least proved him recklessly indifferent to\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe two men by the mast,--whose eyes were evidently upon him,--had no\r\nvery clear view of him where he lay.  Through the white mist they could\r\nsee only something like the shape of a human being recumbent along the\r\nplanks; and of that only the legs and lower half of the body.  Even had\r\nit been daylight they could not, from their position, have seen his head\r\nand shoulders; for both would have been concealed by the empty rum-cask,\r\nalready mentioned, which stood upon its end exactly by the spot where\r\nO'Gorman had rested his head.\r\n\r\nThe Irishman, above all others, had taken a delight in the contents of\r\nthat cask,--so long as a drop was left; and now that it was all gone,\r\nperhaps the smell of the alcohol had influenced him in choosing his\r\nplace of repose.\r\n\r\nWhether or not, he was now sleeping on a spot which was to prove the\r\nlast resting-place of his life.  Cruel destiny had decreed that from\r\nthat slumber he was never more to awaken!\r\n\r\nThis destiny was now being shaped out for him; and by the two\r\nindividuals who were regarding him from the bottom of the mast.\r\n\r\n\"He's sound asleep,\" whispered one of them to the other.  \"You hear that\r\nsnore?  _Parbleu_! only a hog could counterfeit that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sound as a top!\" asserted the other.\r\n\r\n\"_C'est bon_!\" whispered the first speaker, with a significant shrug of\r\nthe shoulders.  \"If we manage matters smartly, he need never wake again.\r\nWhat say you, comrade?\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree to anything you may propose,\" assented the other.  \"What is\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"There need be no noise about it.  A single blow will be sufficient,--if\r\ngiven in the right place.  With the blade of a knife through his heart,\r\nhe'll not make three kicks.  He'll never know it till he's in the next\r\nworld.  _Peste_!  I could almost envy him such an easy way of getting\r\nout of this!\"\r\n\r\n\"You think it might be done without making a noise?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easy as falling overboard.  One could hold something over his mouth, to\r\nkeep his tongue quiet; while the other--You know what I mean?\"\r\n\r\nThe horrid act to be performed by the other was left unspoken,--even in\r\nthose confidential whisperings.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" replied the confederate, objectingly, \"suppose the thing done,--\r\nhow about matters in the morning?  They'd know who did it.  Leastwise,\r\ntheir suspicions would fall upon us,--upon you to a certainty, after\r\nwhat's happened.  You haven't thought of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't I?  But I have, _mon ami_!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well; and what?\"\r\n\r\n\"First place.  They're not in the mind to be particular,--none of\r\nthem,--so long as they get something to eat.  Secondly; if they should\r\nkick up a row, our party is the strongest; and I don't care what comes\r\nof it.  We may as well all die at once, as die by bits.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there's no fear of any trouble from the others.  I've got an idea\r\nthat'll prevent that.  To save appearances, he can commit suicide.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah! _camarade_! how dull you are.  The fog has got into your skull.\r\nDon't you know the _Irlandais_ has got a knife, and a sharp one.\r\n_Peste_!  I know it.  Well,--perhaps it can be stolen from him.  If so,\r\nit can also be found sticking in the wound that will deprive him of\r\nlife.  Now do you comprehend me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do,--I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"First, to steal the knife.  Go you: I daren't: it would look suspicious\r\nfor me to be seen near him,--that is, if he should wake up.  You may\r\nstray over that way, as if you were after nothing particular.  It'll do\r\nno harm to try.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see if I can hook it then,\" responded the other.  \"What if I try\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"The sooner the better.  With the knife in our possession, we'll know\r\nbetter how to act.  Get it, if you can.\"\r\n\r\nThe last speaker remained in his place.  The other, rising into an erect\r\nattitude, stepped apart from his fellow-conspirator, and moved away from\r\nthe mast,--going apparently without any design.  This, however, led him\r\ntowards the empty rum-cask,--alongside of which the Irishman lay asleep,\r\nutterly unconscious of his approach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nA FOUL DEED DONE IN A FOG.\r\n\r\nIt is scarce necessary to tell who were the two men who had been thus\r\nplotting in whispers.  The first speaker was, of course, the Frenchman,\r\nLe Gros,--the other being the confederate who had assisted him in the\r\nperformance of his unfair trick in the lot-casting.\r\n\r\nTheir demoniac design is already known from their conversation,--nothing\r\nmore nor less than to murder O'Gorman in his sleep!\r\n\r\nThe former had two motives prompting him to this horrid crime,--either\r\nsufficiently strong to sway such a nature as his to its execution.  He\r\nhad all along felt hostility to the Irishman,--which the events of that\r\nday had rendered both deep and deadly.  He was wicked enough to have\r\nkilled his antagonist for that alone.  But there was the other motive,\r\nmore powerful and far more rational to influence him to the act.  As\r\nabove stated, it had been finally arranged that the suspended fight was\r\nto be finished by the earliest light of the morning.  Le Gros knew that\r\nthe next scene in that drama of death was to be the last; and, judging\r\nfrom his experience of the one already played, he felt keenly\r\napprehensive as to the result.  He had been fully aware, before the\r\ncurtain fell upon the first act, that his life could then have been\r\ntaken; and, conscious of a certain inferiority to his antagonist, he now\r\nfelt cowed, and dreaded the final encounter.\r\n\r\nTo avoid it, he was willing to do anything, however mean or wicked,--\r\nready to commit even the crime of murder!\r\n\r\nHe knew that if he should succeed in destroying his adversary,--so long\r\nas the act was not witnessed by their associates,--so long as there\r\nshould be only circumstantial evidence against him,--he would not have\r\nmuch to fear from such judges as they.  It was simply a question as to\r\nwhether the deed could be done silently and in the darkness; and that\r\nquestion was soon to receive an answer.\r\n\r\nThe trick of killing the unfortunate man with his own knife,--and making\r\nit appear that he had committed self-destruction,--would have been too\r\nshallow to have been successful under any other circumstances; but Le\r\nGros felt confident that there would be no very strict investigation;\r\nand that the inquest likely to be held on the murdered man would be a\r\nvery informal affair.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the risk to him would be less than that he might expect on\r\nthe consummation of the combat,--the _finale_ of which would in all\r\nprobability, be the losing of his life.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer undecided about doing the foul deed.  He had quite\r\ndetermined upon it; and the attempt now being made by his confederate to\r\nsteal the knife was the first stop towards its perpetration.\r\n\r\nThe theft was too successfully accomplished.  The wretch on getting up\r\nto the rum-cask, was seen to sit down silently by its side; and, after a\r\nfew moments passed in this position he again rose erect, and moved back\r\ntowards the mast.  Dark as was the night, Le Gros could perceive\r\nsomething glittering in the hand of his accomplice, which he knew must\r\nbe the coveted weapon.\r\n\r\nIt was so.  The sleeper had been surreptitiously disarmed.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the two men might have been seen standing in juxtaposition;\r\nand while thus together the knife was furtively transferred from the\r\nhand of the accomplice into that of the true assassin.\r\n\r\nThen both, assuming a careless attitude, for a while remained near the\r\nmast, apparently engaged in some ordinary conversation.  An occasional\r\nshifting of their position, however, took place,--though so slight that,\r\neven under a good light, it would scarce have been observed.  A series\r\nof these movements, made at short intervals, ended in bringing the\r\nconspirators close up to the empty hogshead; and then one of them sat\r\ndown by it.  The other, going round it, after a short lapse of time,\r\nimitated the example of his companion by seating himself on the opposite\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThus far there was nothing in the behaviour of the two men to have\r\nattracted the attention of their associates on the raft,--even had the\r\nlatter been awake.  Even so, the obscurity that surrounded their\r\nmovements would have hindered them from being very clearly comprehended.\r\n\r\nThere was no eye watching the assassins, as they sat down by the side of\r\ntheir sleeping victim; none fixed upon them as both simultaneously leant\r\nover him with outstretched arms,--one holding what appeared a piece of\r\nblanket over his face, as if to stifle his breath,--the other striking\r\ndown upon his breast with a glittering blade, as if stabbing him to the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nThe double action occupied scarce a second of time.  In the darkness, no\r\none appeared to perceive it, except they were its perpetrators.  No one\r\nseemed to hear that choking, gurgling cry that accompanied it; or if\r\nthey did, it was only to shape a half conjecture, that some one of their\r\ncompanions was indulging in a troubled dream!\r\n\r\nThe assassins, horror-stricken at what they had done, skulked\r\ntremblingly back to their former position by the mast.\r\n\r\nTheir victim, stretched on his back, remained motionless upon the spot\r\nwhere they had visited him; and anyone standing over him, as he lay,\r\nmight have supposed that he was still slumbering!\r\n\r\nAlas! it was the slumber of death!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nDOUSING THE GLIM.\r\n\r\nWe left the crew of the _Catamaran_ in full occupation,--\"smoking\"\r\nshark-flesh on the back of a _cachalot_ whale.\r\n\r\nTo make sure of a sufficient stock,--enough to last them with light\r\nrations for a voyage, if need be, to the other side of the Atlantic,--\r\nthey had continued at the work all day long, and several hours into the\r\nnight.  They had kept the fire ablaze by pouring fresh spermaceti into\r\nthe furnace of flesh which they had constructed, or rather excavated, in\r\nthe back of the leviathan; and so far as that kind of fuel was\r\nconcerned, they might have gone on roasting shark-steaks for a\r\ntwelvemonth.  But they had proved that the spermaceti would not burn to\r\nany purpose without a wick; and as their spare ropes were too precious\r\nto be all picked into oakum, they saw the necessity of economising their\r\nstock of the latter article.  But for this deficiency, they might have\r\npermitted the furnace-lamp to burn on during the whole night, or until\r\nit should go out by the exhaustion of the wick.\r\n\r\nAs they were not yet quite satisfied with the supply of broiled\r\nshark-meat, they had resolved to take a fresh spell at roasting on the\r\nmorrow; and in order that the wick should not be idly wasted, they had\r\n\"doused the glim\" before retiring to rest.\r\n\r\nThey had extinguished the flame in a somewhat original fashion,--by\r\npouring upon it a portion of the liquid spermaceti taken out of the\r\ncase.  The light, after giving a final flash, had gone out, leaving them\r\nin utter darkness.\r\n\r\nBut they had no difficulty in finding their way back to the deck, of\r\ntheir craft, where they designed passing the remainder of the night.\r\nDuring the preceding days they had so often made the passage from\r\n_Catamaran_ to _cachalot_, and _vice versa_, that they could have gone\r\neither up or down blindfolded; and indeed they might as well have been\r\nblindfolded on this their last transit for the night, so dense was the\r\ndarkness that had descended over the dead whale.\r\n\r\nAfter groping their way over the slippery shoulders of the leviathan,\r\nand letting themselves down by the rope they had attached to his huge\r\npectoral fin, they made their supper upon a portion of the hot roast\r\nthey had brought along with them; and, washing it down with a little\r\ndiluted \"canary,\" they consigned themselves to rest.\r\n\r\nBetter satisfied with their prospects than they had been for some time\r\npast, they soon fell asleep; and silence reigned around the dark\r\nfloating mass that included the forms of _cachalot_ and _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nAt that same moment a less tranquil scene was occurring scarce ten miles\r\nfrom the spot; for it is scarce necessary to say that the light seen by\r\nthe ruffians on the great raft--and which they had fancifully mistaken\r\nfor a ship's galley-fire,--was the furnace fed by spermaceti on the back\r\nof the whale.\r\n\r\nThe extinction of the flame had led to a scene which was reaching its\r\nmaximum of noisy excitement at about the time that the crew of the\r\n_Catamaran_ were munching their roast shark-meat and sipping their\r\ncanary.  This scene had continued long after every individual of the\r\nlatter had sunk into a sweet oblivion of the dangers that surrounded\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll four slept soundly throughout the remainder of the night.  Strange\r\nto say, they felt a sort of security, moored alongside that monstrous\r\nmass, which they would not have experienced had their frail tiny craft\r\nbeen by itself alone upon the ocean.  It was but a fancied security, it\r\nis true: still it had the effect of giving satisfaction to the spirit,\r\nand through this, producing an artificial incentive to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was daylight before any of them awoke,--or it should have been\r\ndaylight, by the hour: but there was a thick fog around them,--so thick\r\nand dark that the carcass of the _cachalot_ was not visible from the\r\ndeck of the _Catamaran_, although only a few feet of water lay between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBen Brace was the first to bestir himself.  Snowball had never been an\r\nearly riser; and if permitted by his duties, or the neglect of them\r\neither, he would have kept his couch till midday.  Ben, however, knew\r\nthat there was work to be done, and no time to be wasted in idleness.\r\nThe captain of the _Catamaran_ had given up all hopes of the return of\r\nthe whaler; and therefore the sooner they could complete their\r\narrangements for cutting adrift from the carcass, and continuing their\r\ninterrupted course towards the west, the better would be their chance of\r\nultimately reaching land.\r\n\r\nSnowball, _sans ceremonie_, was shaken out of his slumbers; and the\r\nprocess of restoring him to wakefulness also awoke little William and\r\nLilly Lalee,--so that the whole crew were now up and ready for action.\r\n\r\nA hasty _dejeuner a la matelot_ served for the morning repast; after\r\nwhich Snowball and the sailor, accompanied by the boy, climbed once more\r\nupon the back of the _cachalot_ to resume the operations which had been\r\nsuspended for the night; while the girl, as usual, remained in charge of\r\nthe _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY.\r\n\r\nSUSPICIOUS SOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe ex-cook, in the lead of those who ascended to the summit of the\r\ncarcass, had some difficulty in finding his kitchen; but, after groping\r\nsome time over the glutinous epidermis of the animal, he at length laid\r\nhis claws upon the edge of the cavity.\r\n\r\nThe others joined him just as he had succeeded in inserting a bit of\r\nfresh wick; and soon after a strong flame was established, and a fresh\r\nspitful of shark-steaks hung frizzling over it.\r\n\r\nNothing more could be done than wait until the meat should be _done_.\r\nThere was no \"basting\" required,--only an occasional turning of the\r\nsteaks and a slight transposition of them on the harpoon spit,--so that\r\neach should have due exposure to the flame.\r\n\r\nThese little culinary operations needed only occasional attention on the\r\npart of the cook.  Snowball, who preferred the sedentary _pose_, as soon\r\nas he saw his \"range\" in full operation, squatted down beside it.  His\r\ncompanions remained standing.\r\n\r\nScarcely five minutes had passed, when the negro was seen to make a\r\nstart as if some one had given him a kick in the shin.  Simultaneously\r\nwith that start the exclamation \"Golly!\" escaped from his lips.\r\n\r\n\"What be the matter, Snowy?\" interrogated Brace.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!  Hab ye no hear nuffin'?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the sailor,--little William chiming in with the negative.\r\n\r\n\"I hab den,--I hab hear someting.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat I doan know.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the frizzlin' o' those shark-steaks; or, maybe, some sea-bird\r\nsqueaking up in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, neyder one nor todder.  Hush!  Massa Brace, I hab hear some soun'\r\n'tirely diffrent,--somethin' like de voice ob human man.  You obsarb\r\nsilence.  Maybe we hear im agen.\"\r\n\r\nSnowball's companions, though inclined to incredulity, obeyed his\r\ninjunction.  They might have treated it with less regard, had they not\r\nknown the Coromantee to be gifted with a sense of hearing that was\r\nwonderfully acute.  His largely-developed ears would have proved this\r\ncapacity; but they knew that he possessed it, from having witnessed many\r\nexhibitions of it previous to that time.  For this reason they yielded\r\nto his double solicitation,--to remain silent and listen.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, to the surprise of Ben Brace and William, and not a\r\nlittle to the astonishment of the negro, a tiny voice reached them from\r\nbelow,--which they all easily recognised as that of Lilly Lalee.\r\n\r\n\"O Snowball,\" called out the girl, addressing herself to her especial\r\nprotector, \"I hear people speaking.  It's out upon the water.  Do you\r\nnot hear them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!  Lilly Lally,\" answered the negro, speaking down to his _protege_\r\nin a sort of hoarse whisper; \"hush, Lilly, pet; doan you 'peak above him\r\nLilly Breff.  Keep 'till, dat a good gal.\"\r\n\r\nThe child, restrained by this string of cautionary appeals, offered no\r\nfurther remark; and Snowball, making a sign for his companions to\r\ncontinue silent, once more resumed his listening attitude.\r\n\r\nBen Brace and the boy, convinced by this additional testimony that the\r\nCoromantee must have heard something more than the frizzling of the\r\nshark-flesh, without saying a word, imitated his example, and eagerly\r\nbent their ears to listen.\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait before becoming convinced that Snowball _had_\r\nheard something besides the spirting of the shark-steaks.  They heard\r\nsomething more themselves.  They heard sounds that could not be mistaken\r\nfor those of the sea.  _They were the voices of Men_!\r\n\r\nThey were still at some distance,--though, perhaps, not so distant as\r\nthey seemed.  The thick fog, which, as every one knows, has the effect\r\nof deadening sound, was to be taken into account; and, making allowance\r\nfor this, the voices heard might not be such a great way off.\r\n\r\nWhatever was the distance, it was constantly becoming less.  The\r\nlisteners could tell this, ere they had stood many minutes listening.\r\nWhoever gave utterance to those sounds--words they were--must be moving\r\nonward,--coming towards the carcass of the _cachalot_.\r\n\r\nHow were they coming?  They could not be walking upon the water: they\r\nmust be aboard a ship?\r\n\r\nThis interrogatory occurred to those who stood upon the whale.  Could\r\nthey have answered it in the affirmative, their own voices would soon\r\nhave been uplifted in a joyous huzza; while the hail \"Ship ahoy!\" would\r\nhave been sent through the sombre shadows of the mist, in the hope of\r\nits receiving an answer.\r\n\r\nWhy was the hail not heard?  Why did the crew of the _Catamaran_ stand\r\nlistening to those voices without making challenge, and with looks that\r\nbetokened apprehension rather than relief?\r\n\r\nSix words that escaped from the lips of Ben Brace will explain the\r\nsilence of himself and his companions, as well at the dissatisfied air\r\nthat had impressed itself upon their faces.  The six words were:--\r\n\r\n\"_Dangnation! it be the big raft_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY ONE.\r\n\r\nUNPLEASANT CONJECTURES.\r\n\r\n\"Dangnation! it be the big raft.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the singular speech that fell from the lips of the sailor, and\r\nwith an accent that proclaimed it ominous.  And why ominous?  Why should\r\nthe presence of that embarkation--known to them as the \"big raft\"--cause\r\napprehension to the crew of the _Catamaran_?\r\n\r\nSo far as Ben Brace and little William were concerned, the question has\r\nbeen already answered.  It may be remembered with what feelings of alarm\r\nthey first listened to the voices of Snowball and Lilly Lalee,--heard in\r\na similar manner during the darkness of the night,--and with what\r\nsuspicious caution they had made their approach to the Coromantee in the\r\nmiddle of his casks.  It may be remembered for what reason they were\r\nthus suspicious, for it was then given,--a dread on the part of\r\nWilliam--and a great one, too--of being devoured by that cannibal crew;\r\nand on the part of his generous protector a fear of becoming a victim to\r\ntheir revenge.\r\n\r\nThe same motive for their fears still existed; and their apprehension of\r\nbeing approached by the raft was as unabated as ever.\r\n\r\nSnowball's dread of the _Pandora's_ people might not have been so acute,\r\nbut for a certain circumstance that came before his mind.  He had been\r\nmade aware,--by sundry ill-usage he had received from the slaver's\r\ncaptain and mate, just previous to the climax of the catastrophe,--that\r\nhe was himself regarded as the author of it.  He knew he had been; and\r\nhe supposed that the thing must have become known to the rest of the\r\ncrew.  He had not encountered them afterwards; and well had it been for\r\nhim,--for certainly they would have wreaked their vengeance upon him\r\nwithout stint Snowball had sense enough to be aware of this; and\r\ntherefore his aversion to any further intercourse with the castaways of\r\nthe lost ship was quite as strong as that of either Ben Brace or the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nAs for Lilly Lalee, her fears were due to a less definite cause, and\r\nonly arose from observing the apprehension of her companions.\r\n\r\n\"De big raff,\" said Snowball, mechanically repeating the sailor's last\r\nwords.  \"You b'lieve 'im be dat, Massa Brace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shiver my timbers if I know what to think, Snowy!  If it be that--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ef 'im be dat, wha' den?\" inquired the Coromantee, seeing that Brace\r\nhad stopped short in what he was going to say.\r\n\r\n\"Why, only that we're in an ugly mess.  There's no reason to think they\r\nhave picked up a stock o' provisions, since we parted wi' them.  I don't\r\nknow how they've stuck it out,--that is, supposin' it be them.  They may\r\nhave got shark-meat like ourselves; or they have lived upon--\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor suddenly suspended his speech, glancing towards William, as\r\nif what he was about to say had better not reach the ears of the lad.\r\n\r\nSnowball, however, understood him,--as was testified by a significant\r\nshake of the head.\r\n\r\n\"As for water,\" continued the sailor, \"they had some left; but not\r\nenough to have lasted them to this time.  They had rum,--oceans o'\r\nthat,--but it 'ud only make things worse.  True, they mout a caught some\r\no' the rain in their shirts and tarpaulins, as we did; but they weren't\r\nthe sort to be careful o' it wi' a rum-cask standin' by; an' I dar say,\r\nby this time, though they may have some'at to eat,--as you knows,\r\nSnowy,--they'll be dyin' for a drop o' drink.  In that case--\"\r\n\r\n\"In dat case, dey rob us ob de whole stock we hab save.  Den we perish\r\nfo' sartin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure o' that, at least,\" continued the sailor.  \"But they wouldn't stop\r\nby robbin' us o' our precious water.  They'd take everything; an' most\r\nlikely our lives into the bargain.  Let us hope it ain't them we've\r\nheard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha' you say, Master Brace?  'Pose 'um be de capten an' dem odders in\r\nde gig?  Wha' you tink?\"\r\n\r\n\"It mout,\" answered the sailor.  \"I warn't thinkin' o' them.  It mout\r\nbe; an' if so, we han't so much to fear as from t' other 'uns.  They\r\narn't so hard up, I should say; or even if they be, there arn't so many\r\no' 'em to bully us.  There were only five or six o' them.  I should be\r\ngood for any three o' that lot myself; an' I reckon you an' Will'm here\r\ncould stan' a tussle wi' the others.  Ah!  I wish it war them.  But it\r\narn't likely: they had a good boat an' a compass in it; and if they've\r\nmade any use o' their oars, they ought to be far from here long afore\r\nthis.  You've got the best ears, nigger: keep them well set, an' listen.\r\nYou know the voices o' the ole _Pan's_ crew.  See if you can make 'em\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the above dialogue, which had been carried on in an undertone,--a\r\nwhisper, in fact,--the mysterious voices had not been again\r\ndistinguished.  When first heard, they appeared to proceed from two or\r\nmore men engaged in conversation; and, as we have said, were only very\r\nindistinct,--either from the speakers being at a distance or talking in\r\na low tone of voice.\r\n\r\nThe Catamarans now listened, expecting to hear some words pronounced in\r\na louder tone; and yet not wishing to hear them.  Rather would they that\r\nthose voices should never again sound in their ears.\r\n\r\nFor a time it seemed us if they were going to have this wish gratified.\r\nFull ten minutes elapsed, and no sound reached their ears, either of\r\nhuman or other voice.\r\n\r\nThis silence was at first satisfactory; but all at once a reflection\r\ncame across the mind of Ben Brace, which gave a new turn to his thoughts\r\nand wishes.\r\n\r\nWhat if the voices heard had come from a different sort of men?  Why\r\nshould they be those of the slaver's castaway crew,--either the ruffians\r\non the raft or the captain's party in the gig?  What, after all, if they\r\nhad proceeded from the decks of the whaler?\r\n\r\nThe old whalesman had not thought of this before; and, now that he did\r\nthink of it, it caused such a commotion in his mind, that he could\r\nhardly restrain himself from crying out \"Ship ahoy!\"\r\n\r\nHe was hindered, however, by a quick reflection that counselled him to\r\ncaution.  In case of its not being the whaler's men that had been heard\r\nit must be those of the slaver; and the hail would but too certainly be\r\nthe precursor to his own destruction, as well as that of his companions.\r\n\r\nIn a whisper he communicated his thoughts to Snowball, who became\r\nequally affected by them,--equally inclined to cry \"Ship ahoy!\" and\r\nalike conscious of the danger of doing so.\r\n\r\nA strife of thought was now carried on in the bosoms of both.  It was\r\nlamentable to reflect, that they might be close to a ship,--within\r\nhailing distance of her,--which could at once have rescued them from all\r\nthe perils that surrounded them; and that this ship might be silently\r\ngliding past, shrouded from their sight under that thick fog,--in\r\nanother hour to be far off upon the ocean, never to come within hailing\r\ndistance again!\r\n\r\nA single word--a shout--might save them; and yet they dared not utter\r\nit; for the same shout might equally betray, and lead to their\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThey were strongly tempted to risk the ambiguous signal.  For some\r\nseconds they stood wavering between silence and \"Ship ahoy!\" but caution\r\ncounselled the former, and prudence at length triumphed.\r\n\r\nThis course was not adopted accidentally.  A process of reasoning that\r\npassed through the mind of the old whalesman,--founded upon his former\r\nprofessional experiences,--conducted him to it.\r\n\r\nIf it be the whale-ship, reasoned he, she must have come back in search\r\nof the _cachalot_.  Her crew must have known that they had killed it.\r\nThe \"drogues\" and flag proved that belief on their part, and the\r\nex-whalesman knew that it would be well worth their while to return in\r\nsearch of the whale.  It was this very knowledge that had sustained his\r\nhopes, and delayed him so long by its carcass.  A whale, which would\r\nhave yielded nearly a hundred barrels of spermaceti, was a prize not to\r\nbe picked up every day in the middle of the ocean; and he knew that such\r\na treasure would not be abandoned without considerable search having\r\nfirst been made to recover it.\r\n\r\nAll this was in favour of the probability that the voices heard had\r\nproceeded from the whale-ship; and if so, it was farther probable that\r\nin the midst of that fog, while bent upon such an errand, the crew would\r\nnot care to make way; but, on the contrary, would \"lay to,\" and wait for\r\nthe clearing of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn that case the Catamarans might still expect to see the welcome ship\r\nwhen the fog should rise; and with this hope they came to the\r\ndetermination to keep silence.\r\n\r\nThe hour was still very early,--the sun scarce yet above the horizon.\r\nWhen that luminary should appear, his powerful rays would soon dissipate\r\nthe darkness; and then, if not before, would they ascertain whether\r\nthose voices had proceeded from the throats of monsters or of men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY TWO.\r\n\r\nAN INFORMAL INQUEST.\r\n\r\nThey did not have to stay for the scattering of the fog.  Long before\r\nthe sun had lifted that veil from off the face of the sea, the crew of\r\nthe _Catamaran_ had discovered the character of their neighbours.  They\r\nwere not friends, but dire enemies,--the very enemies they so much\r\ndreaded.\r\n\r\nThe discovery was not delayed.  It was made soon after, and in the\r\nfollowing manner:--\r\n\r\nThe three--Snowball, the sailor, and little William--had kept their\r\nplace on the carcass of the _cachalot_, all three attentively\r\nlistening,--the two last standing up, and the former in a reclining\r\nattitude, with his huge ear laid close to the skin of the whale,--as\r\nthough he believed that to be a conductor of sound.  There was no need\r\nfor them to have been thus straining their ears: for when a sound\r\nreached them at length, it was that of a voice,--so harsh and loud, that\r\na deaf man might almost have heard it.\r\n\r\n\"_Sacre_!\" exclaimed the voice, apparently pronounced in an accent of\r\nsurprise, \"look here, comrades!  Here's a dead man among us!\"\r\n\r\nHad it been the demon of the mist that gave utterance to these speeches,\r\nthey could not have produced a more fearful effect upon those who heard\r\nthem from the back of the _cachalot_.  The accent, along with that\r\nprofane shibboleth, might have proceeded from anyone who spoke the\r\nlanguage of France; but the tone of the voice could not be mistaken.  It\r\nhad too often rung in their ears with a disagreeable emphasis.  \"Massa\r\nLe Grow, dat am,\" muttered the negro.  \"Anybody tell dat.\"\r\n\r\nSnowball's companions made no reply.  None was required.  Other voices\r\nrose up out of the mist.\r\n\r\n\"A dead man!\" shouted a second.  \"Sure enough.  Who is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the Irishman!\" proclaimed a third.  \"See!  He's been killed!\r\nThere's a knife sticking between his ribs!  He's been murdered!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's his own knife,\" suggested some one.  \"I know it; because it once\r\nbelonged to me.  If you look you'll find his name on the haft.  He\r\ngraved it there the very day he bought it from me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of silence, as if they had paused to confirm the\r\nsuggestion of the last speaker.\r\n\r\n\"You're right,\" said one, resuming the informal inquest.  \"There's his\r\nname, sure enough,--_Larry O'Gorman_.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's killed himself!\" suggested a voice not hitherto heard.  \"He's\r\ncommitted suicide!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder at his doing so,\" said another, confirmingly.  \"He\r\nexpected to have to die anyhow; and I suppose he thought the sooner it\r\nwas off his mind the better it would be for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's that?\" inquired a fresh speaker, who appeared to dissent from the\r\nopinions of those that had preceded him.  \"Why should he expect to die\r\nany more than the rest of us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget, mate, that the fight was not finished between him and\r\nMonsieur Le Gros?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I don't forget it.  Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yourself!\"\r\n\r\n\"It don't follow he was to be the next to die,--not as I can see.  Look\r\nat this, comrades!  There's been foul play here!  The Irishman's been\r\nstabbed with his own knife.  That's plain enough; but it is not so sure\r\nhe did it himself, Why should he?  I say again, there's been foul play?\"\r\n\r\n\"And who do you accuse of foul play?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't accuse anyone.  Let them bring the charge, as have seen\r\nsomething.  Somebody must know how this came about.  There's been a\r\nmurder.  Can anyone tell who did it?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of silence of more than a minute in duration.  No one\r\nmade answer.  If anyone knew who was the murderer, they failed to\r\nproclaim it.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, mates!\" put in one, whose sharp voice sounded like the cry\r\nof a hyena, \"I'm hungry as a starved shark.  Suppose we suspend this\r\ninquest, till we've had breakfast.  After that we can settle who's done\r\nthe deed,--if there's been anyone, except the man himself.  What say ye\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\nThe horrid proposal was not replied to by anyone.  The loud shout that\r\nsucceeded it sprang from a different cause; and the words that were\r\nafterwards uttered had no reference to the topic under consideration.\r\n\r\n\"A light! a light!\" came the cry, vociferated by several voices.\r\n\r\n\"It's the light we saw last night.  It's the galley-fire!  There's a\r\nship within a hundred yards of us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy! ship ahoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ship ahoy! what ship's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why the devil don't you answer our hail?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the oars, men! to the oars.  _Sacre-dieu_!  The lubbers must be\r\nasleep.  Ship ahoy! ship ahoy!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no mistaking the signification of these speeches.  The sailor\r\nand Snowball exchanged glances of despair.  Both had already looked\r\nbehind them.  There, blazing fiercely up, was the fire of spermaceti,\r\nwith the shark-steaks browning in its flame.  In the excitement of the\r\nmoment they had forgotten all about it.  Its light, gleaming through the\r\nfog, had betrayed their presence to those upon the raft; and the order\r\nissued to take to the oars, with the confused plashing that quickly\r\nfollowed, told the Catamarans that the big raft was about to bear down\r\nupon them!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY THREE.\r\n\r\nSLIPPING THE CABLE.\r\n\r\n\"Dar coming on!\" muttered Snowball.  \"Wha' we better do, Massa Brace?\r\nEf we stay hya dey detroy us fo' sartin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay here!\" exclaimed the sailor, who no longer spoke in whispers,\r\nsince such would no longer avail.  \"Anything but that.  Quick, Snowy,--\r\nquick, Will'm!  Back down to the deck o' our craft.  Let's make all\r\nspeed, and cast off from the karkiss o' the whale.  There be time enough\r\nyet; and then it'll be, who's got the heels.  Don't be so bad skeeart,\r\nSnowy.  The ole _Catamaran_ be a trim craft.  I built her myself, wi'\r\nyour help, nigger; an' I've got faith in her speed.  We'll outsail 'em\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat we will, Massa Brace,\" assented Snowball, as, close following the\r\nsailor, he glided down the rope on to the deck of the _Catamaran_, where\r\nlittle William had already arrived.\r\n\r\nIt was the work of only a few minutes to cut the tiny cable by which the\r\nlittle embarkation had been attached to the fin of the _cachalot_, and\r\npush the craft clear of its moorings.\r\n\r\nBut, short as was the time, during its continuance the sun had produced\r\na wonderful change in that oceanic panorama.\r\n\r\nThe floating fog, absorbed by his fervid rays, had almost disappeared\r\nfrom the deep, or at all events had become so dissipated that the\r\ndifferent objects composing that strange tableau in the proximity of the\r\ndead _cachalot_ could all be seen by a single _coup d'oeil_; and were\r\nalso in sight of one another.\r\n\r\nThere was the huge carcass itself, looming like a great black rock above\r\nthe surface of the sea.  Just parting from its side was the little\r\n_Catamaran_, with its sail set, and its crew,--consisting of two men and\r\na boy,--the little Portuguese girl appearing as a passenger,--the two\r\nmen energetically bending to the oars while the boy held hold of the\r\nrudder.\r\n\r\nScarce a hundred yards astern was the larger embarkation,--supporting\r\nits score of dark forms,--some seated, and straining at the oars,--some\r\nsteering,--others attending to the sail; and one or two standing by the\r\nhead, shouting directions to the rest,--all apparently in wonder at the\r\ntableau thus suddenly disclosed, and uncertain what to make of it, or\r\nwhat course to pursue!\r\n\r\nThe occupants of the great raft were infinitely more astonished than\r\nthose of the _Catamaran_.  On the part of the latter there was no longer\r\nany astonishment.  On recognising the voices taking part in that\r\nceremonious inquest they had comprehended all.  The surprise they had at\r\nfirst felt was now changed into terror.\r\n\r\nThe men on the raft were still under the influence of astonishment; and\r\nno wonder.  The apparition that had so suddenly loomed up before their\r\neyes,--at first obscurely seen through the fog, but gradually becoming\r\nmore distinct,--was enough to cause any amount of surprise.  Such a\r\ngrouping of strange objects in such a situation!  The huge carcass of a\r\nwhale,--a fire upon its back, with bright flames blazing upward,--a\r\ncrane over the fire with the curious flitches suspended from it,--a\r\nraft, in some respects resembling their own, supported by empty casks,\r\nand carrying a sail, with four human beings seen upon its deck,--all\r\nthese formed a series of phenomena, or facts, that was enough to have\r\nexcited the surprise of the most indifferent observers.  Some of the men\r\nwere even speechless with wonder, and so continued for a time, while\r\nothers gave vent to their astonishment in loud shouts and excited\r\ngesticulations.\r\n\r\nThat first order issued by Le Gros--for it was his voice that had been\r\nheard giving it--had no other object than to cause a rapid movement\r\ntowards the dark mass, or rather the beacon seen blazing upon its\r\nsummit.  The order had been instantly obeyed; for there was an\r\ninstinctive apprehension on the part of all that, as before, the light\r\nmight again vanish from their view.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer, however, and the fog continued to disperse, they\r\nobtained a fairer view.  Their surprise was not much diminished, though\r\ntheir comprehension of the objects before them became rapidly clearer.\r\n\r\nThe retreat of the Catamarans--for the movements of the latter\r\nproclaimed this design--was of itself suggestive; and, perhaps, more\r\nthan aught else, enabled those from whom they were retreating to\r\ncomprehend the situation.\r\n\r\nAt first they could not even conjecture who they were that occupied the\r\nlittle raft.  They saw four human beings upon it; but the mist was still\r\nthick enough to hinder them from having a clear view of either their\r\nforms, faces, or features.  Through the filmy atmosphere to recognise\r\nthem was impossible.  Had there been but two, and had the embarkation\r\nthat carried them been a mere platform of planks, they might have shaped\r\na conjecture.  They remembered that upon such a structure Ben Brace and\r\nthe boy had given them the slip; and it might be them.  But who were the\r\ntwo others?  And whence came the six water-casks, the sail, and other\r\nparaphernalia seen upon the escaping craft?\r\n\r\nThey did not stay to waste time in conjectures.  It was enough for them\r\nto perceive that the four individuals thus seen were trying to get out\r\nof their reach.  This was _prima facie_ proof that they had something\r\nworth carrying along with them; perhaps water!\r\n\r\nSome one made use of the word.  It was like proclaiming a reprieve to a\r\nwretch upon the scaffold about to be launched into eternity.  It caused\r\nsuch excitement in the minds of the motley crew--all of them suffering\r\nfrom extreme thirst--that, without further hesitancy, they bent eagerly\r\nto their oars,--putting forth the utmost effort of their strength in\r\nchase of the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY FOUR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXXIV.\r\n\r\nThe Chase.\r\n\r\nHalf pulling, half trusting to the sail, in a few seconds they were\r\nalongside the carcass of the _cachalot_.  They saw what it was and\r\ndivined how it came to be there; though still puzzled by the pyrotechnic\r\ndisplay exhibited on its summit.\r\n\r\nAs they passed under the shadow of the huge mass some proposed that they\r\nshould stay by it,--alleging that it would furnish food for all; but\r\nthis proposal was rejected by the majority.\r\n\r\n\"_Pardieu_!\" exclaimed the directing voice of Le Gros; \"we have food a\r\nplenty.  It's drink we want now.  There's no water upon the whale; and\r\nthere must be some in possession of these runaways, whoever they be.\r\nLet us first follow _them_!  If we overhaul them, we can come back.  If\r\nnot, we can return all the same!\"\r\n\r\nThis proposal appeared too reasonable to be rejected.  A muttered assent\r\nof the majority decided its acceptance; and the raft, yielding to the\r\nrenewed impulse of the rowers, swept past the carcass,--leaving both the\r\nblack mass and the blazing beacon astern.\r\n\r\nAs if further to justify the course of action he had counselled, Le Gros\r\ncontinued--\r\n\r\n\"No fear about our finding the dead fish.  This fog is clearing away.\r\nIn half an hour there won't be a trace of it.  We shall be able to make\r\nout the carcass if the whale twenty miles off,--especially with the\r\nsmoke of that infernal fire to guide us.  Pull like the devil!  Be sure\r\nof it, there's water in one of those casks we see.  Only think of\r\nit,--_water_!\"\r\n\r\nIt scarce needed the repetition of this magic word to stimulate his\r\nthirsty companions.  They were already pulling with all their strength.\r\n\r\nFor about ten minutes the chase continued,--both the pursued and the\r\npursuer equally enveloped in vapour.  They were less than two hundred\r\nyards apart, and virtually within view,--though not so near as to\r\ndistinguish one another's features.  Each crew could make out the forms\r\nof the other; but only to tell that they were human beings clad in some\r\nsort of costume.\r\n\r\nIn this respect the Catamarans had the advantage.  They knew who were\r\ntheir pursuers; and all about them.\r\n\r\nThe latter were still in a state of ignorance as to who were the four\r\nindividuals so zealously endeavouring to avoid an interview with them.\r\nThey could perceive that only two of them were full-grown men, and that\r\nthe other two were of smaller size; but this gave them no clew for the\r\nidentification of the fugitives.\r\n\r\nOf course it did not occur to any of them to think over the rest of the\r\n_Pandora's_ people; and even if it had, there was no one who would have\r\nfor a moment supposed that either the black cook, Snowball, or the\r\nlittle Portuguese pickaninny,--rarely seen upon the slaver's deck,--\r\ncould be among the survivors.\r\n\r\nSuch a conjecture never occurred to any of the ruffians upon the great\r\nraft; and therefore they were continuing the chase still ignorant of the\r\nidentity of those who seemed so desirous of escaping them.\r\n\r\nIt was only after the fog had floated entirely away,--or grown so thin\r\nas to appear but transparent film,--that the pursuers identified those\r\nthey were pursuing.\r\n\r\nThen did their doubts cease and their conjectures come to a termination.\r\n\r\nOf the four forms distinguishable upon the deck of the escaping craft,\r\nthere was one that could not be mistaken.\r\n\r\nThat huge, rounded bust covered with its sable epidermis--for the negro\r\nhad stripped to his work,--surmounted by a spherical occiput,--could\r\nbelong to no living creature but the ex-cook of the _Pandora_.  It was\r\nSnowball to a certainty!\r\n\r\nA general shout proclaimed the recognition; and for some moments the air\r\nwas rent with the voices of his _ci-devant_ comrades calling upon the\r\nCoromantee to \"come to an anchor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lie to, Snowball!\" cried several of his old comrades.  \"Why have you\r\ncut your cable in that fashion?  Hold on till we come up.  We mean you\r\nno harm!\"\r\n\r\nSnowball did hold on; though not in the sense that his former associates\r\ndesired.  On the contrary, their request only stimulated him to fresh\r\nexertions, to avoid the renewal of an acquaintance which he knew would\r\ncertainly end in his ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Coromantee was not to be cajoled.  With Ben Brace by his side,\r\nmuttering wholesome counsel, he lent a deaf ear to the proposal of the\r\npursuers; and only answered it by pulling more energetically at his oar.\r\n\r\nWhat had been only a request, now became a demand,--accompanied by\r\nthreats and protestation.  Snowball was menaced with the most dire\r\nvengeance; and told of terrible punishments that awaited him on his\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\nTheir threats had no more influence than their solicitations; and they\r\nwho had given utterance to them arriving after a time, at this\r\nconviction, ceased talking altogether.\r\n\r\nSnowball's silent, though evidently determined, rejection of their\r\ndemands had the effect of irritating those who had made them; and\r\nstimulated by their spite with more energy than ever did they bend\r\nthemselves to the task of overtaking the fugitive craft.\r\n\r\nTwo hundred yards still lay between pursuer and pursued.  Two hundred\r\nyards of clear, unobstructed ocean.  Was that distance to become\r\ndiminished, to the capture of the _Catamaran_; or was it to be\r\nincreased, to her escape?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nNEARER AND NEARER.\r\n\r\nWere the _Catamarans_ to escape or be captured?  Though not propounded\r\nas above, this was the question that occupied the minds of both crews,--\r\nthe pursued and the pursuing.\r\n\r\nBoth were doing their very utmost,--the former to make their escape, the\r\nlatter to prevent it; and very different were the motives by which the\r\ntwo parties were actuated.  The occupants of the lesser raft believed\r\nthemselves to be rowing and sailing for their lives; and they were not\r\nfar astray in this belief; while those upon the larger embarkation were\r\npulling after them with the most hostile intentions,--to rob them of\r\neverything they had got,--even their lives included.\r\n\r\nSo went they over the wide ocean: the pursued exerting themselves under\r\nthe influence of fear; the pursuer, under that of a ferocious instinct.\r\n\r\nIn sailing qualities the _Catamaran_ was decidedly superior to the\r\nlarger raft; and had the wind been only a little fresher she would soon\r\nhave increased the distance between herself and her pursuer.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it was a very gentle breeze that was blowing at the time;\r\nand therefore it was a contest of speed that would most likely have to\r\nbe decided by the oars.  In this respect the _Catamaran_ laboured under\r\na great disadvantage,--she could only command a single pair of oars;\r\nwhile, taking into account the various implements--capstan-bars and\r\nhandspikes--possessed by her competitor, nearly a dozen oars might be\r\nreckoned upon.  In fact, when her crew had got fairly settled down to\r\nthe chase, quite this number of men could be seen acting as rowers.\r\n\r\nThough their strokes were by no means either regular or efficient, still\r\ndid they produce a rate of speed greater than that of the _Catamaran_;\r\nand the crew of the latter saw, to their dismay, that their pursuers\r\nwere gaining upon them.\r\n\r\nNot very rapidly, but sufficiently so to be perceived, and to inspire\r\nthem with the dread belief, that in course of time they would be\r\novertaken.\r\n\r\nUnder this belief, men of a despairing turn of mind would have ceased to\r\nexert themselves, and yielded to a fate that appeared almost certain to\r\nensue.\r\n\r\nBut neither the English sailor nor the Coromantee sea-cook were\r\nindividuals of the yielding kind.  They were both made of sterner\r\nstuff,--and even when the chase was undoubtedly going _against_ them,\r\nthey were heard muttering to each other words of encouragement, and a\r\nmutual determination never to lay down their oars, so long as six feet\r\nof water separated them from their unpitying pursuers.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" ejaculated the sailor, \"it 'ud be no use.  They'd show us no more\r\nmarcy than so many sharks.  I know it by their ways.  Don't lose a\r\nstroke, Snowy.  We may tire 'em out yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nebba fear fo' me, Massa Brace!\" replied the Coromantee.  \"A keep\r\npullin' so long's de be a poun' o' trength in ma arms, or a bit o' breff\r\nin ma body.  Nebba fear!\"\r\n\r\nIt might appear as though the crew of the _Catamaran_ were now\r\ncontending against fate, and without hope.  This, however, was not the\r\ncase; for there was still something like a hope to cheer them on, and\r\nnerve them to continue their exertions.  What was it?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this interrogatory would have been found by anyone who\r\ncould have looked upon the sea,--at some distance astern of the chase.\r\n\r\nThere might have been observed an appearance upon the water, which\r\nbetokened it different from that through which they were making their\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIt resembled a dark, shadowy line, extending athwart the horizon.  It\r\nmight not have attracted the notice of an ordinary observer, but to the\r\neye of Ben Brace,--as he sat by his oar facing it,--that dark line had a\r\npeculiar signification.\r\n\r\nHe knew that it denoted rougher water, and a stiffer breeze than that\r\nblowing upon them; and from this, as well as the clouds fast gathering\r\nastern, he knew there was a wind coming from that quarter.\r\n\r\nHe had imparted his observation to Snowball, and it was this that\r\ncontinued to inspire them with a hope of ultimate escape.  Both believed\r\nthat, with a strong wind in their favour, they would have the advantage\r\nof the pursuer; and so, while still bending all their energies to the\r\npropulsion of the _Catamaran_, they kept their eyes almost continually\r\nfixed upon the sea astern,--even with a more anxious glance than that\r\nwith which they regarded their pursuers.\r\n\r\n\"If we can keep out o' their way,\" muttered he to his fellow oarsman,\r\n\"only twenty minutes longer!  By that time yonder breeze 'll be down on\r\nus; and then we'll ha' some chance.  There be no doubt but they're\r\ngainin' on us now.  But the breeze be a gainin' on them,--equally, if\r\nnot faster.  O if we only had a puff o' yonder wind!  It be blowin'\r\nfresh and strong.  I can see it curlin' up the water not three knots\r\nastarn o' the big raft.  Pull for your life, Snowy.  Shiver my timbers!\r\nthey be a gainin' on us faster than ever!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a despairing tone in these last words, that told how fearful\r\nappeared their situation to the captain of the _Catamaran_; and the sign\r\nof assent made by Snowball in reply,--an ominous shake of the head,--\r\nshowed that the ex-cook shared the apprehensions of his comrade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY SIX.\r\n\r\nCUT IN TWAIN.\r\n\r\nFor some seconds the sailor and Snowball remained silent,--both too busy\r\nwith their oars, as well as their eyes, to find time for speech.\r\n\r\nTheir pursuers were noisy enough.  They had kept quiet, so long as there\r\nappeared to be any uncertainty about the results of the chase; but as\r\nsoon as they became assured that their clumsy craft was going faster\r\nthan that of which they were in pursuit,--and they no longer felt doubt\r\nabout overtaking the latter,--their fiendish voices once more filled the\r\nair; and commands for the Catamarans to come to,--with threats of\r\nrevenge in case of non-compliance,--were hurled after the fugitives.\r\n\r\nOne man was conspicuous among the rest both for the position which he\r\nheld upon the raft and the menacing words and gestures of which he made\r\nuse.  This man was Le Gros.\r\n\r\nStanding prominently forward, near the head of the embarkation, with a\r\nlong boat-hook in his hand, he appeared to direct the movements of the\r\nothers,--urging them in every way to their utmost exertions.  He was\r\nheard telling them that he saw both food and water in possession of the\r\nfugitives--a cask of the latter, as he stated, being lashed to the\r\n_Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nIt need scarce be said that the statement--whether true or fallacious,--\r\nacted as a stimulus to his comrades at the oar.  The word \"water\" was\r\nmusic to their ears; and, on hearing it pronounced, one and all of them\r\nput forth their utmost strength.\r\n\r\nThe increased speed thus obtained for the larger craft war likely to\r\nbring about the crisis.  She was now seen to gain upon the lesser more\r\nrapidly than ever; and, before another ten minutes had elapsed, she had\r\nforged so close to the stern timbers of the _Catamaran_ that an active\r\nman might almost have leaped from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the latter beheld the proximity with despair.  They saw the\r\nblack waves, with white curling crests, coming on behind.  They saw the\r\nsky becoming overcast above their heads; but it appeared only to scowl\r\nupon them,--as if to make darker the dread doom that was now threatening\r\nso near.\r\n\r\n\"Shiver my timbers!\" cried the sailor, alluding to that too tardy wind,\r\n\"it will be too late to save us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late!\" echoed the voice of Le Gros from the big raft, his white\r\nteeth, as they shone through his black beard, imparting to him a\r\nferocity of aspect that was hideous to behold.  \"Too late, you say,\r\nMonsieur Brace.  For what, may I ask?  Not too late for us to get a\r\ndrink out of your water-cask.  Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"You son of a sea-cook!\" he continued, addressing himself to the negro;\r\n\"why don't you hold your oars?  _Sacre-Dieu_! what's the use, you ugly\r\nnigger?  Don't you see we'll board you in six seconds more?  Drop your\r\noars, I say, and save time.  If you don't, we'll skin you alive when\r\nwe've got our flippers upon you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nebba, Massa Grow!\" defiantly retorted Snowball? \"you nebba 'kin dis\r\nnigga 'live.  He go die 'fore you do dat.  He got him knife yet.  By\r\ngolly! me kill more than one ob you 'fore gib in.  So hab a care, Massa\r\nGrow!  You lay hand on ole Snowy, you cotch de tarnel goss.\"\r\n\r\nTo this threat of resistance the Frenchman did not vouchsafe reply: for\r\nthe rafts were now so near to each other that his attention became\r\nengrossed by something that left no time for further speech.\r\n\r\nHe saw that the _Catamaran_ was within reach of his boat-hook, and,\r\nleaning forwards with the long shaft extended, he struck its\r\ngrappling-iron into her stern timber.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two there was a struggle, which would have ended in the\r\ntwo rafts being brought in contact with one another but for an adroit\r\nstroke given by the oar of the English sailor.  This not only detached\r\nthe boat-hook from its grip, but also from the grasp of Le Gros, and\r\nsent the implement shivering through the air.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant of time the Frenchman, losing his balance, was seen\r\nto stagger, and then sink suddenly downwards; not into a prostrate\r\nposition, but perpendicularly,--as if his legs had penetrated between\r\nthe timbers of the raft.\r\n\r\nThis was exactly what had occurred: for as soon as the spectators in\r\nboth crafts could recover from their surprise, they saw only so much of\r\nMonsieur Le Gros as lay between his armpits and the crown of his head,--\r\nhis limbs and the lower half of his body being concealed between the\r\nplanks that prevented him from sinking wholly into the water.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it would have been better for him had he made a complete plunge\r\nof it.  At all events, a bold \"header\" could not have had for him a more\r\nunfortunate ending.  Scarce had he sunk between the timber when a wild\r\nshriek came forth from his throat,--accompanied by a pallor of\r\ncountenance, and a contortion of his features, that proclaimed something\r\nmore than a mere \"start\" received by suddenly sinking waist-deep into\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nOne of his comrades,--the confederate ruffian already spoken of,--rushed\r\nforward to raise him out of the trap,--from which he was evidently\r\nunable to extricate himself.\r\n\r\nThe man caught hold of him by the arms, and was dragging him up; when,\r\nall at once, he was seen to let go, and start back with a cry of horror!\r\n\r\nThis singular conduct was explained on looking at the object from which\r\nhe had made such a precipitate retreat.  It was no longer Le Gros, nor\r\neven Le Gros's body; but only the upper half of it, cut off by the\r\nabdomen, as clean as if it had been severed by a pair of gigantic\r\nshears!\r\n\r\n\"A shark!\" cried a voice, which only gave utterance to the thought that\r\nsprung up simultaneously in the minds of all,--both the occupants of the\r\nbig raft, and the crew of the Catamaran.\r\n\r\nThus deplorably terminated the life of a sinful man; who certainly\r\nmerited punishment, and, perhaps deserved no better fate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nAN UNLOOKED-FOR DELIVERANCE.\r\n\r\nA spectacle so unexpected,--but, above all, of such a horrid nature,--\r\ncould not fail to produce a powerful impression upon those who were\r\nwitnesses to it.  It even caused a change of proceedings on the part of\r\nthe pursuers,--almost a suspension of the pursuit,--and on that of the\r\npursued some relaxation in their efforts to escape.  Both parties\r\nappeared for some seconds as if spellbound, and the oars on both rafts\r\nwere for a while held \"apeak.\"\r\n\r\nThis pause in the action was in favour of the _Catamaran_, whose sailing\r\nqualities were superior to those of her pursuer.  Her crew, moreover,\r\nless caring for what had happened to Monsieur Le Gros, were the first to\r\nrecover from their surprise; and before the comrades of the half-eaten\r\nFrenchman thought of continuing the chase, they had forced ahead several\r\nlengths of their craft from the dangerous contiguity so near being\r\nestablished between them.\r\n\r\nThe ruffian crew--now castaways--of the _Pandora_ had been awed by the\r\nstrange incident,--so much so as to believe, for a time, that something\r\nmore than chance had interfered to bring it about.  They were not all\r\nfriends of the unfortunate man, who had succumbed to such a singular\r\nfate.  The inquest that had been interrupted was still fresh in their\r\nminds, and many of them believed that the inquiry--had it proceeded to a\r\njust termination--would have resulted in proving the guilt of Le Gros,\r\nand proclaiming him the murderer of O'Gorman.\r\n\r\nUnder this belief, there were many aboard the big raft that would not\r\nhave cared to continue the chase any further, had it merely been to\r\navenge the death of their late leader.  With them, as with the others,\r\nthere was a different motive for doing so,--a far more powerful\r\nincentive,--and that was the thirst which tortured all, and the belief\r\nthat the escaping craft carried the means to relieve it.\r\n\r\nThe moiety of their mutilated chief, lying along the planks of the raft,\r\nengaged their thoughts only for a very short while; and was altogether\r\nforgotten, when the cry of \"Water!\" once more rising in their midst,\r\nurged them to resume the pursuit.\r\n\r\nOnce more did they betake themselves to their oars,--once more did they\r\nexert their utmost strength,--but with far less effect than before.\r\nThey were still stimulated by the torture of thirst; but they no longer\r\nacted with that unanimity which secures success.  The head that had\r\nhitherto guided them with those imperious eyes--now glaring ghastly from\r\nthe extremity of the severed trunk--was no longer of authority among\r\nthem; and they acted in that undecided and irregular manner always\r\ncertain to result in defeat.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, had things continued as they were, they might have made up for\r\nthe lost opportunity; and, in time, have overtaken the fugitives on the\r\n_Catamaran_; but during that excited interval a change had come over the\r\nsurface of the sea, which influenced the fate both of pursuers and\r\npursued.\r\n\r\nThe dark line, first narrowly observed by the crew of the _Catamaran_\r\nupon the distant verge of the horizon, was no longer a mere streak of\r\nshadowed water.  It had developed during the continuance of the chase,\r\nand now covered both sea and sky,--the latter with black cumbrous\r\nclouds, the former with quick curling waves, that lashed the water-casks\r\nsupporting both rafts, and proclaimed the approach, if not of a storm,\r\nat least a fresh breeze,--likely to change the character of the chase\r\nhitherto kept up between them.\r\n\r\nAnd very quickly came that change to pass.  By the time that the\r\ncastaways on the great raft had once more headed their clumsy\r\nembarkation to the pursuit, they saw the more trim craft,--by her\r\nbuilders yclept the _Catamaran_--with her sails spread widely to the\r\nwind, gliding rapidly out of their reach, and \"walking the water like a\r\nthing of life.\"\r\n\r\nThey no longer continued the pursuit.  They might have done so, but for\r\nthe waves that now, swelling up around the raft, admonished them of a\r\ndanger hitherto unknown.  With the spray rushing over them, and the sea,\r\nat each fresh assault, threatening to engulf their ill-governed craft,\r\nthey found sufficient employment for their remaining strength, in\r\nclinging to the timbers of their rude embarkation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nA THREATENED STORM.\r\n\r\nThus, once more, were the Catamarans delivered from a terrible danger,--\r\nalmost literally \"from the jaws of death\"; and once more, too, by what\r\nappeared a providential interference.\r\n\r\nBen Brace actually believed it so.  It would have been difficult for\r\nanyone to have thought otherwise; but the moral mind of the sailor had\r\nof late undergone some very serious transformations; and the perils\r\nthrough which they had been passing,--with their repeated deliverances,\r\nall apparently due to some unseen hand,--had imbued him with a belief\r\nthat the Almighty must be everywhere,--even in the midst of the\r\nillimitable ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was this faith that had sustained him through the many trials through\r\nwhich they had gone; and that, in the very latest and last,--when the\r\nruffians upon the raft were fast closing upon the _Catamaran_,--had led\r\nhim to give encouraging counsels to Snowball to keep on.  It had\r\nencouraged him, in fine, to strike the boat-hook from the grasp of Le\r\nGros,--which act had ended by putting their implacable enemy _hors du\r\ncombat_, and conducting to their final deliverance.\r\n\r\nIt was this belief that still hindered the brave mariner,--now that the\r\nsea began to surge around them, and the spray to dash over the deck of\r\ntheir frail craft,--hindered him from giving way to a new despair; and\r\nfrom supposing that they had been only delivered from one danger to be\r\noverwhelmed by another.\r\n\r\nFor some time did it seem as if this was to be their fate,--as if,\r\nliterally, they were to be overwhelmed.  The breeze which had so\r\nopportunely carried the _Catamaran_ beyond the reach of the pursuing\r\nraft, soon freshened into a gale; and threatened to continue increasing\r\nto that still more dreaded condition of the ocean atmosphere,--a storm.\r\n\r\nThe rafts were no longer in sight of each other.  Scarce five minutes\r\nhad elapsed, after being grappled by Le Gros, when the breeze had caught\r\nhold of the _Catamaran_; and, from her superior sailing qualities, she\r\nhad soon become separated from the more clumsy embarkation of the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn another hour, the _Catamaran_, under good steering, had swept several\r\nmiles to westward; while the raft, no longer propelled by oars, and its\r\nrudder but ill-directed, had gone drifting about: as if they who\r\noccupied it were making only a despairing effort to keep it before the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nDespite the rising gale and the increasing roughness of the water, there\r\nwere no despairing people upon the _Catamaran_.  Supported by his faith\r\nin providential protection, Ben Brace acted as if there was no danger;\r\nand encouraged his companions to do the same.\r\n\r\nEvery precaution was adopted to provide against accidents.  As soon as\r\nthey saw that the pursuer was left behind,--and they were no longer in\r\nany peril from that quarter,--the sail was lowered upon the mast, as\r\nthere was too great a breadth of it for the constantly freshening\r\nbreeze.  It was not taken in altogether, but only \"shortened,\"--reefed\r\nin a rude fashion,--so as to expose only half its surface to the wind;\r\nand this proved just sufficient to keep the _Catamaran_ \"trim\" and\r\nsteady upon her course.\r\n\r\nIt would not be correct to say that her captain and crew felt no fears\r\nfor her safety.  On the contrary, they experienced the apprehensions\r\nnatural to such a situation; and for this reason did they take every\r\nprecaution against the danger that threatened.  The Coromantee might\r\nhave given way to a feeling of fatalism,--peculiar to his country and\r\nclass,--but there was no danger of Ben Brace doing so.  Notwithstanding\r\nhis faith about being protected by Providence, the sailor also believed,\r\nthat self-action is required on the part of those who stand in need of\r\nsuch protection; and that nothing should be left undone to deserve it.\r\n\r\nThe situation was altogether new to them.  It was the first thing in the\r\nshape of a storm, or even a gale, they had encountered since the\r\nconstruction of their curious craft.  Ever since the burning of the\r\n_Pandora_, they had been highly favoured in this respect.  They had been\r\nnavigating their various embarkations through a \"summer sea,\" in the\r\nmidst of the tropical ocean,--where ofttimes whole weeks elapse without\r\neither winds or waves occurring to disturb its tranquillity,--a sea, in\r\nshort, where the \"calm\" is more dreaded than the \"storm.\"  Up to this\r\ntime they had not experienced any violent commotion of the atmosphere,--\r\nnothing stronger than what is termed a \"fresh breeze,\" and in that the\r\n_Catamaran_ had proved herself an accomplished sailer.\r\n\r\nIt was now to be seen how she would behave under a gale that might end\r\nin a storm,--perhaps a terrific tempest.\r\n\r\nIt would be untrue to say that her crew looked forward to the event\r\nwithout fear.  They did not.  As said, they suffered considerable\r\napprehension; and would have felt it more keenly, but for the cheering\r\ninfluence of that faith with which her captain was sustained, and which\r\nhe endeavoured to impart to his companions.\r\n\r\nLeaning upon this, they looked with less dread upon the sky lowering\r\nabove and the storm gathering around them.\r\n\r\nAs the day advanced the wind continued to freshen until about the hour\r\nof noon.  It was then blowing a brisk gale.  Fortunately for the crew of\r\nthe _Catamaran_, it did not become a storm.  Had it done so their frail\r\ncraft must have been shivered, and her component parts once more\r\nscattered over the ocean.\r\n\r\nIt was just as much as her crew could accomplish to keep them together,\r\nin a sea only moderately rough,--compared with what it would have been\r\nin a storm.  This they discovered during the afternoon of that day; and\r\nit was no great comfort to them to reflect that, in the event of a real\r\nstorm being encountered, the _Catamaran_ would undoubtedly go to pieces.\r\nThey could only console themselves with the hope that such an event\r\nmight not arise until they should reach land, or, which was perhaps more\r\nprobable, be picked up by a ship.\r\n\r\nThe chances of terminating their perilous voyage in either way were so\r\nslight and distant, that they scarce gave thought to them.  When they\r\ndid, it was only to be reminded of the extreme hopelessness of their\r\nsituation, and yield to despairing reflections.  On that particular day\r\nthey had no time to speculate upon such remote probabilities as the\r\nultimate ending of their voyage.  They found occupation enough,--both\r\nfor their minds and bodies,--in insuring its continuance.  Not only had\r\nthey to watch every wave as it came rolling upon them,--and keep the\r\n_Catamaran_ trimly set to receive it,--but they had to look to the\r\ntimbers of the craft, and see that the lashings did not get loose.\r\n\r\nSeveral times did the sea break quite over them; and but that Lilly\r\nLalee and little William were fast tied to the foot of the mast, they\r\nwould both have been washed off, and probably lost amidst the dark waste\r\nof waters.\r\n\r\nIt was just as much as the two strong men could do to keep aboard and\r\neven they had ropes knotted round their wrists and attached to the\r\ntimbers of the raft,--in case of their getting carried overboard.\r\n\r\nOnce a huge billow swept over, submerging them several feet under the\r\nsea.  At this crisis all four thought that their last hour had come, and\r\nfor some seconds were under the belief that they were going to the\r\nbottom, and would never more look upon the light of day.\r\n\r\nBut for the peculiar construction of their raft this, in all likelihood,\r\nwould have been the result; but those buoyant water-casks were not to be\r\n\"drowned\" in such a fashion and soon \"bobbed\" back to the surface, once\r\nmore bringing the _Catamaran_ and her crew above water.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for them that Ben Brace and Snowball had not trusted\r\ntoo much to fate while constructing their abnormal craft.  The\r\nexperienced sailor had foreseen the difficulties that on this day beset\r\nthem; and, instead of making a mere temporary embarkation, to suit the\r\nconditions of the summer sea that then surrounded them, he had spared no\r\npains to render it seaworthy as far as circumstances would allow.  He\r\nand Snowball had used their united strength in drawing tight the cords\r\nwith which the timbers were bound together,--as well as those that\r\nlashed them to the casks,--and their united skill in disposing the rude\r\nmaterials in a proper manner.\r\n\r\nEven after \"launching\" the _Catamaran_,--every day, almost every hour,\r\nhad they been doing something to improve her,--either by giving the\r\ncraft greater strength and compactness, or in some other way rendering\r\nher more worthy both of the sea and her sailors.\r\n\r\nBy this providential industry they were now profiting: since by it, and\r\nit alone, were they enabled to \"ride out\" the gale.\r\n\r\nHad they trusted to chance and given way to indolence,--all the more\r\nnatural under the very hopelessness of their situation,--they would\r\nnever have outlived that day.  The _Catamaran_ might not have gone to\r\nthe bottom, but she would have gone to pieces; and it is not likely that\r\nany of her crew would have survived the catastrophe.\r\n\r\nAs it was, both raft and crew weathered the gale in safety.  Before\r\nsunset the wind had fallen to a gentle zephyr; the tropical sea was\r\ngradually returning to its normal state of comparative calm; and the\r\n_Catamaran_, with her broad sail once more spread to the breeze, was\r\nscudding on,--guided in her course by the golden luminary slowly\r\ndescending towards the western edge of a cloudless heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTY NINE.\r\n\r\nA STARTLING SHRIEK.\r\n\r\nThe night proved pleasanter than the day.  The wind was no longer an\r\nenemy; and the breeze that succeeded was more advantageous than would\r\nhave been a dead calm; since it steadied the craft amidst the rolling of\r\nthe swell.\r\n\r\nBefore midnight the swell itself had subsided.  It had never reached any\r\ngreat height, as the gale had been of short continuance; and for the\r\nsame reason it had suddenly gone down again.\r\n\r\nWith the return of smooth water they were able to betake themselves to\r\nrest.  They needed it, after such a series of fatigues and fears; and\r\nhaving swallowed a few morsels of their unpalatable food, and washed it\r\ndown by a cup of diluted Canary, they all went to rest.\r\n\r\nNeither the wet planking on which they were compelled to encouch\r\nthemselves, nor the sea-soaked garments clinging round their bodies,\r\nhindered them from obtaining sleep.\r\n\r\nIn a colder clime their condition would have been sufficiently\r\ncomfortless; but in the ocean atmosphere of the torrid zone the night\r\nhours are warm enough to render \"wet sheets\" not only endurable, but at\r\ntimes even pleasant.\r\n\r\nI have said that all of them went to sleep.  It was not their usual\r\ncustom to do so.  On other nights one was always upon the watch,--either\r\nthe captain himself, the ex-cook, or the boy.  Of course Lilly Lalee\r\nenjoyed immunity from this kind of duty: since she was not, properly\r\nspeaking, one of the \"crew,\" but only a \"passenger.\"\r\n\r\nTheir customary night-watch had a twofold object: to hold the\r\n_Catamaran_ to her course, and to keep a lookout over the sea,--the\r\nlatter having reference to the chance if seeing a sail.\r\n\r\nOn this particular night their vigil,--had it been kept,--might have had\r\na threefold purpose: for it is not to be forgotten that they were still\r\nnot so very far from their late pursuers.  They too must have been\r\nmaking way with the wind.\r\n\r\nNeither had the Catamarans forgotten it; but even with this thought\r\nbefore their minds, they were unable to resist the fascinations of\r\nMorpheus; and leaving the craft to take her own course, the ships, if\r\nthere were any, to sail silently by, and the big raft, if chance so\r\ndirected it, to overtake them, they yielded themselves to unconscious\r\nslumber.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously were they awakened, and by a sound that might have\r\nawakened the dead.  It was a shriek that came pealing over the surface\r\nof the ocean,--as unearthly in its intonation as if only the ocean\r\nitself could have produced it!  It was short, sharp, quick, and clear;\r\nand so loud as to startle even Snowball from his torpidity.\r\n\r\nThe Coromantee was the first to inquire into its character.\r\n\r\n\"Wha' de debbil am dat?\" he asked, rubbing his ears to make sure that he\r\nwas not labouring under a delusion.\r\n\r\n\"Shiver my timbers if I can tell!\" rejoined the sailor, equally puzzled\r\nby what he had heard.\r\n\r\n\"Dat soun' berry like da voice o' some un go drown,--berry like.  Wha'\r\nsay you, Massa Brace?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a good bit like the voice of a man cut in two by a shark.\r\nThat's what it minded me of.\"\r\n\r\n\"By golly! you speak de troof.  It wa jess like that,--jess like the\r\nlass s'riek ob Massa Grow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet,\" continued the sailor, after a moment's reflection, \"'t warn't\r\nlike that neyther.  'T warn't human, nohow: leastwise, I niver heerd\r\nsuch come out o' a human throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"A don't blieb de big raff can be near.  We hab been runnin' down de\r\nwind ebba since you knock off dat boat-hook.  We got de start o' de\r\n_Pandoras_; an' dar's no mistake but we hab kep de distance.  Dat s'riek\r\nno come from dem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look yonder!\" cried little William, interrupting the dialogue.  \"I see\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereaway?  What like be it?\" inquired the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder!\" answered the lad, pointing over the starboard bow of the\r\n_Catamaran_; \"about three cables' length out in the water.  It's a black\r\nlump; it looks like a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"A boat!  Shiver my timbers if thee bean't right, lad.  I see it now.\r\nIt do look somethin' as you say.  But what ul a boat be doin' here,--out\r\nin the middle o' the Atlantic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dat am a boat,\" interposed Snowball.  \"Fo' sartin it am.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be,\" said the sailor, after more carefully scrutinising it.\r\n\"It is!  I see its shape better now.  There's some un in it.  I see only\r\none; ah, he be standin' up in the middle o' it, like a mast.  It be a\r\nman though; an' I dare say the same as gi'ed that shout, if he be a\r\nhuman; though, sartin, there warn't much human in it.\"\r\n\r\nAs if to confirm the sailor's last assertion, the shriek was repeated,\r\nprecisely as it had been uttered before; though now, entering ears that\r\nwere awake, it produced a somewhat different impression.\r\n\r\nThe voice was evidently that of a man.  Even under the circumstances, it\r\ncould be nothing else, but of a man who had taken leave of his senses.\r\nIt was the wild cry of a maniac!\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Catamaran_ might have continued in doubt as to this had\r\nthey been treated only to a repetition of the shriek; but this was\r\nfollowed by a series of speeches,--incoherent, it is true, but spoken in\r\nan intelligible tongue, and ending in a peal of laughter such as might\r\nbe heard echoing along the corridors of a lunatic asylum!\r\n\r\nOne and all of them stood looking and listening.\r\n\r\nIt was a moonless night, and had been a dark one; but it was now close\r\nupon morning.  Already had the aurora tinged the horizon with roseate\r\nhues.  The grey light of dawn was beginning to scatter its soft rays\r\nover the surface of the ocean; and objects--had there been any--could be\r\ndistinguished at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was an object,--a thing of boat-shape, with a human form\r\nstanding near its middle.  It was a boat, a man in it; and, from the\r\nexclamation and laughter to which they had listened, there could be no\r\ndoubt about the man being mad.\r\n\r\nMad or sane, why should they shun him?  There were two strong men on the\r\nraft, who need not fear to encounter a lunatic under any\r\ncircumstances,--even in the midst of the ocean.  Nor did they fear it;\r\nfor as soon as they became fully convinced that they saw a boat with a\r\nman in it, they \"ported\" the helm of the _Catamaran_, and stood directly\r\ntowards it.\r\n\r\nLess than ten minutes' sailing in the altered course brought them within\r\nfair view of the object that had caused them to deviate; and, after\r\nscrutinising it, less than ten seconds enabled them to satisfy their\r\nminds as to the strange craft and its yet stranger occupant.\r\n\r\nThey saw before them the \"gig\" of the slaver; and, standing \"midships\"\r\nin the boat,--just half-way between stem and stern,--they saw the\r\ncaptain of that ill-starred, ill-fated vessel!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY.\r\n\r\nA MADMAN IN MID-OCEAN.\r\n\r\nIn the minds of the _Catamaran's_ crew there was no longer any cause for\r\nconjecture.  The boat-shaped object on the water, and the human form\r\nstanding up within it, were mysteries no more; nor was there any when\r\nthat boat and that human being were identified.\r\n\r\nIf in the spectacle there was aught still to puzzle them, it was the\r\nseeing only one man in the boat instead of six.\r\n\r\nThere should have been six; since that was the number that the gig had\r\noriginally carried away from the burning bark,--five others besides the\r\none now seen,--and who, notwithstanding a great change in his\r\nappearance, was still recognisable as the slaver's captain.\r\n\r\nWhere were the missing men,--the mates, the carpenter and two common\r\nsailors, who had escaped along with him?  Were they in the boat, lying\r\ndown, and so concealed from the view of those upon the _Catamaran_?  Or\r\nhad they succumbed to some fearful fate, leaving only that solitary\r\nsurvivor?\r\n\r\nThe gig sat high in the water.  Those upon the _Catamaran_ could not see\r\nover its gunwale unless by approaching nearer, and this they hesitated\r\nto do.\r\n\r\nIndeed, on identifying the boat and the individual standing in it, they\r\nhad suddenly hauled down the sail and were lying to, using their oar to\r\nkeep them from drifting any nearer.\r\n\r\nThey had done so from an instinctive apprehension.  They knew that the\r\nmen who had gone off in the gig were not a whit better than those upon\r\nthe big raft; for the officers of the slaver, in point of ruffianism,\r\nwere upon a par with their crew.  With this knowledge, it was a question\r\nfor consideration whether the Catamarans would be safe in approaching\r\nthe boat.  If the six were still in it, and out of food and water, like\r\nthose on the large raft, they would undoubtedly despoil the _Catamaran_,\r\njust as the others had designed doing.  From such as they no mercy need\r\nbe expected; and as it was not likely any succour could be obtained from\r\nthem, it would, perhaps, be better, in every way, to \"give them a wide\r\nberth.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the thoughts that passed hastily through the mind of Ben\r\nBrace, and were communicated to his companions.\r\n\r\nWere the five missing men still aboard the boat?\r\n\r\nThey might be lying down along the bottom,--though it was not likely\r\nthey could be asleep?  That appeared almost impossible, considering the\r\nshouts and screams which the captain at intervals still continued to\r\nsend forth.\r\n\r\n\"By de great gorramity!\" muttered Snowball, \"a doan't b'lieb one ob\r\ndem's leff 'board dat boat, 'ceptin de ole 'kipper himseff; an ob him\r\ndar am nuffin leff cep'n de body.  Dat man's intlek am clar gone.  He am\r\nravin' mad!\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Snowy,\" assented the sailor; \"there be ne'er a one there\r\nbut himself.  At all events they ain't all there.  I can tell by the way\r\nthe gig sits up out o' the water.  No boat o' her size, wi' six men\r\naboard, could have her gunnel as high as that ere.  No!  If there be any\r\nbesides the captain, there's only one or two.  We needn't fear to go as\r\nnigh as we like.  Let's put about, an' board the craft, anyhow.  What\r\nsay ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Haben't de leas' objecshun, Massa Brace, so long you link dar no fear.\r\nDis chile ready take de chance.  If dar be any odder cep'n de 'kipper,\r\nit no like dey am 'trong 'nuff to bully we nohow.  De two ob us be equal\r\nmatch fo' any four ob dem,--say nuffin ob lilly Will'm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel a'most sartin,\" rejoined the sailor, still undecided, \"there be\r\nonly him.  If that's the case, our best way is to close up, and take\r\npossession o' the boat.  We may have some trouble wi' him if be's gone\r\nmad; an' from the way he be runnin' on, it do look like it.  Never mind!\r\nI dare say we'll be able to manage him.  Port about, an' let a see the\r\nthing through.\"\r\n\r\nSnowball was at the steering-oar, and, thus commanded by her captain, he\r\nonce more headed the _Catamaran_ in the direction of the drifting\r\nboat,--while the sailor and William betook them to the oars.\r\n\r\nWhether the occupant of the gig had yet perceived the raft was not\r\ncertain.  It is likely he had not, since the yells and incoherent\r\nspeeches to which he had been giving utterance appeared to be addressed\r\nto no one, but were more like--what they believed them to be--the wild\r\nravings of a lunatic.\r\n\r\nIt was still only the grey twilight of morning, with a slight fog upon\r\nthe water; and although through this the Catamarans had recognised the\r\ngig and captain of the _Pandora_ they had done so with certain souvenirs\r\nto guide them.  Both the boat and its occupant had been seen only\r\nindistinctly: and it was possible that the latter had not seen them, and\r\nwas still unsuspicious of their presence.\r\n\r\nAs they drew nearer, the light at each moment increasing in brightness,\r\nthere was no longer any uncertainty as to their being seen; for, along\r\nwith the yells uttered by the occupant of the gig, could be heard the\r\nsignificant speeches of, \"Sail ho!  Ship ahoy!  What ship's that?  Heave\r\nto, and be--Heave to, you infernal lubbers! if you don't I'll sink you!\"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these varied phrases were jumbled together,\r\nintermingled with screeching exclamations, as well as the excited and\r\ngrotesque gestures that accompanied them, might have been ludicrous, but\r\nfor the painful impression it produced.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer any doubt in the minds of those who witnessed his\r\nbehaviour, that the ex-skipper of the _Pandora_ was mad.  None but a\r\nmadman would have spoken, or acted, as he was doing.\r\n\r\nIn the state he was in, it would be dangerous to go near him.  This was\r\nevident to the occupants of the raft; and when they had arrived within a\r\nhalf-cable's length of the boat, they suspended the stroke of the\r\noars,--with the intention of entering upon a parley, and seeing how far\r\ntheir words might tranquillise him.\r\n\r\n\"Captain!\" cried the sailor, hailing his former commander in a friendly\r\ntone of voice: \"it's me!  Don't you know me?  It's Ben Brace, one o' the\r\nold _Pandora_.  We've been on this bit o' raft ever since the burnin' o'\r\nthe bark.  Myself and Snowball--\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment the sailor's epitomised narrative was interrupted by a\r\nfiendish yell, proceeding from the throat of the maniac.  They were now\r\nnear enough to have a clear view of his face, and could note the\r\nexpression of his features.  The play of these, and the wild rolling of\r\nhis eyes, confirmed them in their belief as to his insanity.  There\r\ncould be no doubt about it; but if there had, what soon after succeeded\r\nwas proof sufficient to satisfy them.\r\n\r\nDuring the continuance of the discourse addressed to him by the sailor,\r\nhe had kept silent, until the word \"Snowball\" fell upon his ears.  Then\r\nall at once he became terribly excited,--as was testified by a terrible\r\nshriek, a twitching contortion of his features, and a glaring in his\r\neyes that was awful to behold.\r\n\r\n\"Snowball!\" screamed he; \"Snowball, you say, do you?  Snowball, the\r\ninfernal dog!  Show him to me!  Ach!  Blood and furies! it was he that\r\nfired my ship.  Where is he?  Let me at him!  Let me lay my hands upon\r\nhis black throat!  I'll teach the sneaking nigger how to carry a candle\r\nthat'll light him into the next world.  Snowball!  Where,--where is he?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment his rolling orbs became suddenly steadied; and all could\r\nsee that his gaze was fixed upon the Coromantee with a sort of desperate\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\nSnowball might have quailed under that glance, had there been time for\r\nhim to take heed of it.  But there was not: for upon the instant it was\r\ngiven the madman uttered another wild screech, and, rising into the air,\r\nsprang several feet over the gunwale of the gig.\r\n\r\nFor a second or two he was lost to sight under the water.  Then, rising\r\nto the surface, he was seen swimming with vigorous sweep towards the\r\n_Catamaran_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE INSANE SWIMMER.\r\n\r\nA dozen strokes would have carried him up to the craft; which they could\r\nnot have hindered him from boarding, except by using some deadly\r\nviolence.  To avoid this, the oars were plied; and the raft rapidly\r\npulled in a contrary direction.\r\n\r\nFor all this, so swiftly did the maniac make way through the water, that\r\nit was just as much as they could do to keep the _Catamaran_ clear of\r\nhis grasp; and it was only after Ben Brace and Snowball had got fairly\r\nbent to their oars, that they could insure themselves against being\r\novertaken.  Then became it a chase in which there was no great advantage\r\nin speed between the pursued and the pursuer; though what little there\r\nmight have been was in favour of the former.\r\n\r\nHow long this singular chase might have continued, it is impossible to\r\nsay.  Perhaps until the lunatic had exhausted his insane strength, and\r\nsunk into the sea: since he appeared to have no idea of making an\r\nattempt to return to the boat.  He never looked round to see how far he\r\nwas leaving it behind him.  On the contrary, he swam straight on, his\r\neyes steadfastly fixed upon the one object that seemed to have\r\npossession of his soul,--the Coromantee!  That it was of him only he was\r\nthinking could be told from his speech,--for even while in the water he\r\ncontinued to utter imprecations on the head of the negro,--his name\r\nbeing every moment mentioned in terms of menace.\r\n\r\nThe chase could not have lasted much longer,--even had it been permitted\r\nto terminate by the exhaustion of the insane swimmer.  The supernatural\r\nstrength of insanity could not forever sustain him; and in due time he\r\nwould have sunk helplessly to the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the sort of death that Fate had designed for him.  A\r\nstill more violent ending of his life was in store for the unfortunate\r\nwretch.  Though he himself knew it not, those aboard the _Catamaran_ had\r\nnow become aware of its approach.\r\n\r\nBehind him,--scarce half a cable's length,--two creatures were seen\r\nmoving through the water.  Horrible-looking creatures they were: for\r\nthey were hammer-headed sharks!  Both were conspicuously seen: for they\r\nhad risen to the surface, and were swimming with their dark dorsal fins\r\nprotruded above, and set with all the triangular sharpness of staysails.\r\nAlthough they had not been observed before by those on the _Catamaran_,\r\nthey appeared to have been swimming in the proximity of the gig,--on\r\nwhich, beyond doubt, they had been for some time attending.\r\n\r\nThey were now advancing side by side, in the same direction as the\r\nswimmer, and there could be no doubt as to their design.  They were\r\nevidently in chase of _him_, with as much eagerness as he was in chase\r\nof the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nThe wretched man neither saw nor thought of them.  Even had he seen them\r\nit is questionable whether he would have made any attempt to escape from\r\nthem.  They would, in all likelihood, have appeared a part of the\r\nfearful phantasmagoria already filling his brain.\r\n\r\nIn any case he could not have eluded those earnest and eager pursuers,--\r\nunless by the intervention of those upon the raft; and even had these\r\nwished to succour him, it would have required a most prompt and adroit\r\ninterference.  They _did_ wish it, even became desirous to save him.\r\nTheir hearts melted within them as they saw the unfortunate man, maniac\r\nthough he was, in such a situation.  Fear him as they might,--and deem\r\nhim an enemy as they did,--still was he a human being,--one of their own\r\nkind,--and their natural instinct of hostility towards those ravenous\r\nmonsters of the deep had now obliterated that which they might have felt\r\nfor him about to become their prey.\r\n\r\nRisking everything from the encounter which they might expect with a\r\nmadman, they suspended their oars, and then commenced backing towards\r\nhim.  Even Snowball exerted himself to bring the _Catamaran_ within\r\nsaving distance of the wretch who, in his insane hatred, was threatening\r\nhis own destruction.\r\n\r\nTheir good intentions, however, proved of no avail.  The man was\r\ndestined to destruction.  Before they could get near enough to make any\r\neffective demonstration in his favour, the sharks had closed upon him.\r\nThey who would have saved him saw it, and ceased their exertions to\r\nbecome spectators of the tragical catastrophe.\r\n\r\nIt was a brief affair.  The monsters swam up, one on each side of their\r\nintended victim, till their uncouth bodies were parallel with his.  He\r\nsaw one of them first, and, with an instinct more true than his\r\ndethroned powers of reason, swerved out of the way to avoid it.  The\r\neffort resulted in placing him within reach of the other, that, suddenly\r\nturning upon its side, grasped him between its extended jaws.\r\n\r\nThe shriek that followed appeared to proceed from only the half of his\r\nbody; for the other half, completely dissevered, had been already\r\ncarried off between the terrible teeth of the _zygaena_.\r\n\r\nThere was but one cry.  There was not time for another, even had there\r\nbeen strength.  Before it could have been uttered, the remaining moiety\r\nof the madman's body was seized by the second shark, and borne down into\r\nthe voiceless abysm of the ocean!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY TWO.\r\n\r\nBOARDING THE BOAT.\r\n\r\nBack to the boat!  In the minds of the _Catamaran's_ crew naturally did\r\nthis resolve succeed to the spectacle they had just witnessed.  There\r\nwas nothing to stay them on that spot.  The bloodstained water, which\r\nmomentarily marked the scene of the tragedy, had no further interest for\r\nthose who had been spectators to it; and once more heading their craft\r\nfor the drifting gig, they made way towards it as fast as their oars and\r\nthe sail, now reset, would carry them.\r\n\r\nThey no longer speculated as to the boat being occupied by a crew,--\r\neither sleeping or awake.  In view of the events that had occurred, it\r\nwas scarce possible that anyone, in either condition, could be aboard of\r\nher.  She must have been abandoned, before that hour, by all but the\r\nsolitary individual standing amidships, and pouring out his insane\r\nutterances to the ears of the ocean.\r\n\r\nWhere were the men that were missing?  This was the question that\r\noccupied the crew of the _Catamaran_,--as they advanced towards the\r\ndeserted gig--and to which they could give no satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nThey could only shape conjectures,--none of which had much air of\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nFrom what they knew or suspected to have occurred upon the large raft\r\nthey could draw inferences of a revolting nature.  It might be that the\r\nsame course had been pursued among those in the gig; and yet it seemed\r\nscarce probable.  It was known that the latter had gone off from the\r\nburning bark, if not sufficiently provided for a long voyage, at least\r\nwith a stock of both food and water that should have sustained them for\r\nmany days.  Little William had been a witness of their departure, and\r\ncould confirm these facts.  Why then had their boat-voyage resulted so\r\ndisastrously?  It could not have arisen from want.  It could not have\r\nbeen the gale.\r\n\r\nIn all probability, had the sea washed over them, the boat would either\r\nhave been swamped or capsized.  The captain alone could not have righted\r\nher.  Besides, why should he be the only survivor of the six?\r\n\r\nBut there had not been storm enough for a disaster of this kind; and\r\nunless by some dire mismanagement, the men could not have fallen\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\nStill puzzled to account for the strange condition of things, the crew\r\nof the _Catamaran_ continued to pull towards the gig, and at length came\r\nup with it.\r\n\r\nThere they beheld a horrid spectacle, though it afforded no clue to what\r\nhad occurred.  In fact it left the affair as inexplicable as ever.  What\r\nthey saw gave them reason to believe that some terrible tragedy had\r\ntranspired on board the boat; and that not the elements, but the hand of\r\nman, had caused the disappearance of the crew.\r\n\r\nAlong the bottom timbers lay stretched a human form.  It was not only\r\nlifeless, but disfigured by many wounds,--anyone of which would have\r\nproved mortal.  The face was gashed in the most frightful manner; and\r\nthe skull crushed in several places, as if by repeated blows of a heavy\r\nhammer, while numerous wounds, that had been inflicted by some\r\nsharp-bladed weapon or implement, appeared over the breast and body.\r\n\r\nThis mutilated shape of humanity was lying half submerged in the\r\nbilge-water contained in the boat, and which looked more like blood.  So\r\ndeep was it in colour, and in such quantity, that it was difficult to\r\nbelieve it could have been stained by the blood of only that one body,\r\nto which in turn, as the red fluid went washing over it, had been\r\nimparted the same sanguinary hue.\r\n\r\nThe features of the hideous corpse could not be identified.  The axe,\r\nknife, or whatever weapon it was, had defaced them beyond recognition;\r\nbut for all this, both Ben Brace and Snowball recognised the mutilated\r\nremains.  Something in the garments still clinging round the corpse was\r\nremembered, and by this they were enabled to identify it as that of one\r\ntoo well-known to them,--the first mate of the slaver.\r\n\r\nInstead of elucidating the mystery, this knowledge only rendered it more\r\ninexplicable.  It was evident the man had been murdered.  The wounds\r\nproved that; for from the appearance of the extravasated blood they must\r\nhave been given while he was still alive.\r\n\r\nIt was but natural to suppose that the deed had been done by his insane\r\ncompanion.  The number and character of the wounds,--consisting of\r\nblows, cuts, and gashes, showed that they had been inflicted by some one\r\nout of his senses; for life must have been extinct before half of them\r\ncould have been given.\r\n\r\nSo far the circumstances seemed clear enough.  The maniac captain had\r\nmurdered the mate.  No motive could be guessed at; for no motive was\r\nneeded to inspire a madman.\r\n\r\nBeyond this all was shrouded in mystery.  What was to explain the\r\nabsence of the other four?  What had become of them?  The crew of the\r\n_Catamaran_ could only frame conjectures,--all of a horrid nature.  That\r\nof Snowball was the most rational that could be arrived at.\r\n\r\nIt suggested the probability that the first mate and captain had\r\ncombined in the destruction of the others,--their motive being to get\r\nall the food and water themselves, and thus secure a better chance of\r\nprolonging their lives.  They might have accomplished their atrocious\r\ndesign in various ways.  There might have been a struggle in which these\r\ntwo men,--much stronger than their fellows,--had proved victorious; or\r\nthere might not have been any contest at all.  The foul crime could have\r\nbeen committed in the night, when their unsuspicious comrades were\r\nasleep; or even by the light of day, when the latter were under the\r\nspell of intoxication,--produced by the brandy that had furnished part\r\nof the stores of the gig.\r\n\r\nAll these were horrid imaginings; but neither Snowball nor the sailor\r\ncould help giving way to them.  Otherwise they could not account for the\r\ndreadful drama of which that bloodstained boat must have been the scene.\r\n\r\nSupposing their conjectures to have been correct, no wonder that the\r\nsole survivor of such scenes should have been found a raving lunatic,--\r\nno wonder the man had gone mad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE CATAMARAN ABANDONED.\r\n\r\nFor some time the crew of the _Catamaran_ stood contemplating the gig\r\nand its lifeless occupant, with looks that betokened repugnance.\r\n\r\nBy reason of the many dread scenes they had already passed through, this\r\nfeeling was the less intense, and gradually wore away.  It was neither\r\nthe time nor the place for any show of sentimentalism.  Their own\r\nperilous situation was too strongly impressed on their minds to admit of\r\nunprofitable speculations; and instead of indulging in idle conjectures\r\nabout the past, they directed their thoughts to the future.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration was, what was to be done with the gig?\r\n\r\nThey would take possession of her, of course.  There could be no\r\nquestion about this.\r\n\r\nIt is true the _Catamaran_ had done them good service.  She had served\r\nto keep them afloat, and thus far saved their lives.\r\n\r\nIn calm weather they could have made themselves very comfortable on\r\ntheir improvised embarkation; and might have remained safe upon it, so\r\nlong as their water and provisions lasted.  But with such a slow-sailing\r\ncraft the voyage might last longer than either; and then it could only\r\nresult in certain death.  They might not again have such good fortune in\r\nobtaining fish; and their stock of water once exhausted, it was too\r\nimprobable to suppose they should ever be able to replenish it.  There\r\nmight not be another shower of rain for weeks; and even should it fall,\r\nit might be in such rough weather that they could not collect a single\r\nquart of it.  Her slow-sailing was not the only objection to the\r\n_Catamaran_.  Their experience in the gale of the preceding night had\r\ntaught them, how little they could depend upon her in the event of a\r\nreal storm.  In very rough weather she would certainly be destroyed.\r\nHer timbers under the strain would come apart; or, even if they should\r\nstick together, and by the buoyancy of the empty casks continue to keep\r\nafloat, the sea would wash over them all the same and either drown or\r\notherwise destroy them.\r\n\r\nIn such a long time as it must take before reaching land, they could not\r\nexpect to have a continuance of fair weather.\r\n\r\nWith the gig,--a first-rate craft of its kind,--the case would be\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nBen Brace well knew the boat, for he had often been one of its crew of\r\nrowers.\r\n\r\nIt was a fast boat,--even under oars,--and with a sail set to it, and a\r\nfair wind, they might calculate upon making eight or ten knots an hour.\r\nThis would in no great time enable them to run down the \"trades,\" and\r\nbring them to some port of the South American coast,--perhaps to Guiana,\r\nor Brazil.\r\n\r\nThese speculations occupied them only a few seconds of time.  In fact\r\nthey had passed through their minds long before they arrived alongside\r\nthe gig; for they were but the natural considerations suggested by the\r\npresence of the boat.\r\n\r\nThey were now in possession of a seaworthy craft.  It seemed as if\r\nProvidence had thrown it in their way; and they had no idea of\r\nabandoning it.  On the contrary, it was the raft which was to be\r\ndeserted.\r\n\r\nIf they hesitated about transferring themselves and their chattels from\r\nthe _Catamaran_ to the gig, it was but for a moment; and that brief\r\nspace of time was only spent in considering how they might best\r\naccomplish the transfer.\r\n\r\nThe boat had first to be got into a fit state for their reception; and\r\nas soon as they had recovered from the shock caused by that hideous\r\nspectacle, the sailor and Snowball set to work to remove the body out of\r\nsight, as well as every trace of the sanguinary strife that must have\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nThe mutilated corpse was cast into the sea, and sank at once under the\r\nsurface,--though perhaps never to reach the bottom, for those two\r\nravenous monsters were still hovering around the spot, in greedy\r\nexpectation of more food for their insatiable stomachs.\r\n\r\nThe red bilge-water was next baled out of the boat,--the inside timbers\r\ncleared of their ensanguined stains, and swilled with clean water from\r\nthe sea; which was in its turn thrown out, until no trace remained of\r\nthe frightful objects so lately seen.\r\n\r\nA few things that had been found in the boat were permitted to remain:\r\nas they might prove of service to the crew coming into possession.\r\nAmong these there was not a morsel of food, nor a drop of drinking\r\nwater; but there was the ship's compass, still in good condition; and\r\nthe sailor knew that this treasure was too precious to be parted with:\r\nas it would enable them to keep to their course under the most clouded\r\nskies.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the gig was ready to receive them, the \"stores\" of the\r\n_Catamaran_ were transferred to it.  The cask of water was carefully\r\nhoisted aboard the boat,--as also the smaller cask containing the\r\nprecious \"Canary.\"  The dried fish packed inside the chest, the oars,\r\nand other implements were next carried over the \"gangway\" between the\r\ntwo crafts,--each article being stowed in a proper place within the gig.\r\n\r\nThere was plenty of room for everything: as the boat was a large one,\r\ncapable of containing a dozen men; and of course ample for the\r\naccommodation of the _Catamaran's_ crew, with all their _impedimenta_.\r\n\r\nThe last transfer made was the mast and sail, which were \"unshipped\"\r\nfrom the _Catamaran_ to be set up on the gig, and which were just of the\r\nright size to suit the latter craft.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing left upon the raft that could be of any use to them on\r\ntheir boat-voyage; and after the mast and sail had been removed, the\r\n_Catamaran_ appeared completely dismantled.\r\n\r\nAs they undid the lashings,--which during the transfer had confined her\r\nto the gig,--a feeling of sadness pervaded the minds of her former crew.\r\nThey had grown to feel for that embarkation,--frail and grotesque as it\r\nwas,--a sort of attachment; such as one may have for a loved home.  To\r\nthem it had been a home in the midst of the wilderness of waters; and\r\nthey could not part from it without a strong feeling of regret.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was partly for this reason they did not at once dip their\r\noars into the water and row away from the raft; though they had another\r\nreason for lingering in its proximity.\r\n\r\nThe mast had to be \"stepped\" in the gig and the sail bent on to it; and,\r\nas it seemed better that these things should be done at once, they at\r\nonce set about doing them.\r\n\r\nDuring the time they were thus engaged, the boat drifted on with the\r\nbreeze, making two or three knots to the hour.  But this caused no\r\nseparation between the two crafts; for the same breeze carried the\r\ndismantled raft--now lying light upon the water--at the like rate of\r\nspeed; and when at length the mast stood amidships in the gig, and the\r\nsailyard was ready to be hauled up to it, there was scarce a cable's\r\nlength between them.\r\n\r\nThe _Catamaran_ was astern, but coming on at a fair rate of speed,--as\r\nif determined not to be left behind in that lone wilderness of waters!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY FOUR.\r\n\r\nA \"SCHOOL\" OF SPERM-WHALES.\r\n\r\nTo all appearance the hour had arrived when they were to look their last\r\non the embarkation that had safely carried them through so many dangers.\r\nIn a few minutes their sail would be spread before a breeze, that would\r\nimpel their boat at a rapid rate through the water; and in a short time\r\nthey would see no more of the _Catamaran_, crawling slowly after them.\r\nA few miles astern, and she would be out of sight,--once and forever.\r\n\r\nSuch was their belief, as they proceeded to set the sail.\r\n\r\nLittle were they thinking of the destiny that was before them.  Fate had\r\nnot designed such a sudden separation; and well was it for them that the\r\n_Catamaran_ had clung so closely upon their track, as still to offer\r\nthem an asylum,--a harbour of refuge to which they might retreat,--for\r\nit was not long before they found themselves in need of it.\r\n\r\nAs stated, they were proceeding to set the sail.  They had got their\r\nrigging all right,--the canvas bent upon the yard, the halliards rove,\r\nand everything except hauling up and sheeting home.\r\n\r\nThese last operations would have been but the work of six seconds, and\r\nyet they were never performed.\r\n\r\nAs the sailor and Snowball stood, halliards in hand, ready to hoist up,\r\nan exclamation came from little William, that caused both of them to\r\nsuspend proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe boy stood gazing out upon the ocean,--his eyes fixed upon some\r\nobject that had caused him to cry out.  Lalee was by his side also,\r\nregarding the same object.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Will'm?\" eagerly inquired the sailor, hoping the lad might\r\nhave made out a sail.\r\n\r\nWilliam had himself entertained this hope.  A whitish disk over the\r\nhorizon had come under his eye; which for a while looked like spread\r\ncanvas, but soon disappeared,--as if it had suddenly dissolved into air.\r\n\r\nWilliam was ashamed of having uttered the exclamation,--as being guilty\r\nof causing a \"false alarm.\"  He was about to explain himself, when the\r\nwhite object once more rose up against the sky,--now observed by all.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I saw,\" said the alarmist, confessing himself mistaken.\r\n\r\n\"If ye took it for a sail, lad,\" rejoined the sailor, \"you war mistaken.\r\nIt be only the spoutin' o' a sparmacety.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's more than one,\" rejoined William, desirous of escaping from his\r\ndilemma.  \"See, yonder's half a dozen of them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Theer ye be right, lad,--though not in sayin' there's half a dozen.\r\nMore like there be half a hundred o' 'em.  There's sure to be that\r\nnumber, whar you see six a-blowin' at the same time.  There be a\r\n`school' o' them, I be bound,--maybe a `body.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Golly!\" cried Snowball, after regarding the whales for a moment, \"dey\r\nam a-comin' dis way!\"\r\n\r\n\"They be,\" muttered the old whalesman, in a tone that did not show much\r\nsatisfaction at the discovery.  \"They're coming right down upon us.  I\r\ndon't like it a bit.  They're on a `passage,'--that I can see; an' it be\r\ndangerous to get in their way when they're goin' so,--especially aboard\r\na craft sich as this un'.\"\r\n\r\nOf course the setting of the sail was adjourned at this announcement; as\r\nit would have been, whether there had been danger or not.  A school of\r\nwhales, either upon their \"passage\" or when \"gambolling,\" is a spectacle\r\nso rare, at the same time so exciting, as not to be looked upon without\r\ninterest; and the voyager must be engrossed in some very serious\r\noccupation who can permit it to pass without giving it his attention.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more magnificent than the movements of these vast\r\nleviathans, as they cleave their track through the blue liquid\r\nelement,--now sending aloft their plume-like spouts of white vapour,--\r\nnow flinging their broad and fan-shaped flukes into the air; at times\r\nbounding with their whole bodies several feet above the surface, and\r\ndropping back into the water with a tremendous concussion, that causes\r\nthe sea to swell into huge foam-crested columns, as if a storm was\r\npassing over it.\r\n\r\nIt was the thought of this that came into the mind of the ex-whalesman;\r\nand rendered him apprehensive,--as he saw the school of _cachalots_\r\ncoming on towards the spot occupied by the frail embarkation.  He knew\r\nthat the swell caused by the \"breaching\" of a whale is sufficient to\r\nswamp even a large-sized boat; and if one of the \"body\" now bowling down\r\ntowards them should chance to spring out of the water while passing\r\nnear, it would be just as much as they could do to keep the gig from\r\ngoing upon her beam-ends.\r\n\r\nThere was not much time to speculate upon chances, or probabilities.\r\nWhen first seen, the whales could not have been more than a mile\r\ndistant: and going on as they were, at the rate of ten knots an hour,\r\nonly ten minutes elapsed before the foremost was close up to the spot\r\noccupied by the boat and the abandoned raft.\r\n\r\nThey were not proceeding in a regular formation; though here and there\r\nfour or five might have been seen moving in a line, abreast with one\r\nanother.  The whole \"herd\" occupied a breadth extending about a mile\r\nacross the sea; and in the very centre of this, as ill-luck would have\r\nit, lay the cockle-shell of a boat and the abandoned raft.\r\n\r\nIt was one of the biggest \"schools\" that Ben Brace had ever seen,\r\nconsisting of nearly a hundred individuals,--full-grown females,\r\nfollowed by their \"calves,\"--and only one old bull, the patron and\r\nprotector of the herd.  There was no mistaking it for a \"pod\" of\r\nwhales,--which would have been made up of young males just escaped from\r\nmaternal protection, and attended by several older individuals of their\r\nown sex,--acting as trainers and instructors.\r\n\r\nJust as the _ci-devant_ whalesman had finished making this observation,\r\nthe _cachalots_ came past, causing the sea to undulate for miles around\r\nthe spot,--as if a tempest had swept over, and was succeeded by its\r\nswell.  One after another passed with a graceful gliding, that might\r\nhave won the admiration of an observer viewing it from a position of\r\nsafety.  But to those who beheld it from the gig, there was an idea of\r\ndanger in their majestic movement,--heightened by the surf-like sound of\r\ntheir respirations.\r\n\r\nThey had nearly all passed, and the crew of the gig were beginning to\r\nbreathe freely; when they perceived the largest of the lot--the old\r\nbull--astern of the rest and coming right towards them.  His head, with\r\nseveral fathoms of his back, protruded above the surface, which at\r\nintervals he \"fluked\" with his tail,--as if giving a signal to those\r\npreceding him, either to direct their onward course, or warn them of\r\nsome threatened danger.\r\n\r\nHe had a vicious look about him,--notwithstanding his patriarchal\r\nappearance,--and the ex-whalesman uttered an exclamation of warning as\r\nhe approached.\r\n\r\nThe utterance was merely mechanical, since nothing could be done to ward\r\noff the threatened encounter.\r\n\r\nNothing was done.  There was no time to act, nor even to think.  Almost\r\non the same instant in which the warning cry was heard the whale was\r\nupon them.  He who had uttered it, along with his companions, felt\r\nthemselves suddenly projected into the air, as if they had been tossed\r\nfrom a catapult, and their next sensation was that of taking \"a\r\ntremendous header\" into the depths of the fathomless ocean!\r\n\r\nAll four soon came to the surface again; and the two who had best\r\nretained their senses,--the sailor and Snowball,--looked around for the\r\ngig.  There was no gig in sight, nor boat of any kind!  Only some\r\nfloating fragments; among which could be distinguished a cask or two,\r\nwith a scattering of loose boards, oars, handspikes, and articles of\r\napparel.  Among these were struggling two youthful forms,--recognisable\r\nas little William and Lilly Lalee.\r\n\r\nA quick transformation took place in the tableau.\r\n\r\nA cry arose, \"Back to the _Catamaran_!\" and in a score of seconds the\r\nboy-sailor was swimming alongside the A.B. for the raft; while the\r\nCoromantee, with Lilly Lalee hoisted upon his left shoulder, was\r\ncleaving the water in the same direction.\r\n\r\nAnother minute and all four were aboard the embarkation they had so\r\nlately abandoned,--once more saved from the perils of the deep!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY FIVE.\r\n\r\nWORSE OFF THAN EVER.\r\n\r\nThere was no mystery about the incident that had occurred.  It had\r\nscarce created surprise; for the moment that the old whalesman felt the\r\nshock, he knew what had caused it, as well as if he had been a simple\r\nspectator.\r\n\r\nThe others, warned by him that danger might be expected in the passage\r\nof the whales--though then unapprised of its exact nature--were fully\r\naware of it now.  It had come and passed,--at least, after mounting once\r\nmore upon the raft, they perceived that their lives were no longer in\r\nperil.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence needed no explanation.  The detached timbers of the gig\r\nfloating about on the water, and the shock they had experienced, told\r\nthe tale with sufficient significance.  They had been \"fluked\" by the\r\nbull-whale, whose fan-shaped tail-fins, striking the boat in an upward\r\ndirection, had shattered it as easily as an eggshell, tossing the\r\nfragments, along with the contents, both animate and inanimate, several\r\nfeet into the air.\r\n\r\nWhether it were done out of spite or wanton playfulness, or for the\r\ngratification of a _whalish_ whim, the act had cost the huge leviathan\r\nno greater effort than might have been used in brushing off a fly; and\r\nafter its accomplishment the old bull went bowling on after its\r\nfrolicsome school, gliding through the water apparently with as much\r\nunconcern as if nothing particular had transpired!\r\n\r\nIt might have been nothing to him,--neither the capsize nor its\r\nconsequences; but it was everything to those he had so unceremoniously\r\nupset.\r\n\r\nIt was not until they had fairly established themselves on the raft, and\r\ntheir tranquillity had become a little restored, that they could reflect\r\nupon the peril through which they had passed, or realise the fulness of\r\ntheir misfortune.\r\n\r\nThey saw their stores scattered about over the waves,--their oars and\r\nimplements drifting about; and, what was still worse, the great\r\nsea-chest of the sailor, which, in the hurry of the late transfer, had\r\nbeen packed full of shark-flesh, they could not see.  Weighted as it\r\nwas, it must have gone to the bottom, carrying its precious contents\r\nalong with it.\r\n\r\nThe water-cask and the smaller one containing the Canary were still\r\nafloat, for both had been carefully bunged; but what mattered drink if\r\nthere was no meat?--and not a morsel appeared to be left them.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes they remained idly gazing upon the wreck,--a spectacle\r\nof complete ruin.  One might have supposed that their inaction proceeded\r\nfrom despair, which was holding them as if spellbound.\r\n\r\nIt was not this, however.  They were not the sort to give way to\r\ndespair.  They only waited for an opportunity to act, which they could\r\nnot do until the tremendous swell, caused by the passage of the whales,\r\nshould to some extent subside.\r\n\r\nJust then the sea was rolling \"mountains high,\" and the raft on which\r\nthey stood--or rather, crouched--was pitching about in such a manner,\r\nthat it was as much as they could do to hold footing upon it.\r\n\r\nGradually the ocean around them resumed its wonted tranquillity; and, as\r\nthey had spent the interval in reflection, they now proceeded to action.\r\n\r\nThey had formed no definite plans, further than to collect the scattered\r\nmaterials,--such of them as were still above water,--and, if possible,\r\nre-rig the craft which now carried them.\r\n\r\nFortunately the mast, which had been forced out of its \"stepping\" in the\r\ntimbers of the gig and entirely detached from the broken boat, was seen\r\ndrifting at no great distance off, with the yard and sail still adhering\r\nto it.  As these were the most important articles of which the\r\n_Catamaran_ had been stripped, there would be no great difficulty in\r\nrestoring her to her original entirety.\r\n\r\nTheir first effort was to recover some of the oars.  This was not\r\naccomplished without a considerable waste of time and a good deal of\r\nexertion.  On the dismantled embarkation there was not a stick that\r\ncould be used for rowing; and it was necessary to propel it with their\r\noutspread palms.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval of necessary inaction, the floating fragments of the\r\nwreck had drifted to a considerable distance,--or rather had the raft,\r\nbuoyed up by its empty casks, glided past them, and was now several\r\ncable-lengths to leeward.\r\n\r\nThey were compelled, therefore, to work up the wind and their progress\r\nwas consequently slow,--so slow as to become vexatious.\r\n\r\nSnowball would have leaped overboard, and recovered the oars by\r\nswimming: but the sailor would not listen to this proposal, pointing out\r\nto his sable companion the danger to be apprehended from the presence of\r\nthe sharks.  The negro made light of this, but his more prudent comrade\r\nrestrained him; and they continued patiently to paddle the raft with\r\ntheir hands.  At length a pair of oars were got hold of; and from that\r\nmoment the work went briskly on.\r\n\r\nThe mast and sail were fished out of the sea and dragged aboard; the\r\ncasks of water and wine were once more secured; and the stray implements\r\nwere picked up one after another,--all except those of iron, including\r\nthe axe, which had gone to the bottom of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nTheir greatest loss had been the chest and its contents.  This was\r\nirreparable; and in all probability the precursor of a still more\r\nserious misfortune,--the loss of their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE DARKEST HOUR.\r\n\r\nDeath in all its dark reality once more stared them in the face.  They\r\nwere entirely without food.  Of all their stores, collected and cured\r\nwith so much care and ingenuity, not a morsel remained.  Besides what\r\nthe chest contained there had been some loose flitches of the dried fish\r\nlying about upon the raft.  These had been carried into the boat, and\r\nmust have been capsized into the sea.  While collecting the other\r\n_debris_, they had looked for them in hopes that some stray pieces might\r\nstill be picked up; not one had been found.  If they floated at all,\r\nthey must have been grabbed by the sharks themselves, or some other\r\nravenous creatures of the deep.\r\n\r\nHad any such waifs come in their way, the castaways just at that crisis\r\nmight not have cared to eat them with the bitterness they must have\r\nderived from their briny immersion; still they knew that in due time\r\nthey would get over any daintiness of this kind; and, indeed, before\r\nmany hours had elapsed, all four of them began to feel keenly the\r\ncravings of a hunger not likely to refuse the coarsest or most\r\nunpalatable food.  Since that hurried retreat from their moorings by the\r\ncarcass of the _cachalot_ they had not eaten anything like a regular\r\nmeal.\r\n\r\nThe series of terrible incidents, so rapidly succeeding one another,\r\nalong with the almost continuous exertions they had been compelled to\r\nmake, had kept their minds from dwelling upon the condition of their\r\nappetites.  They had only snatched a morsel of food at intervals, and\r\nswallowed a mouthful of water.\r\n\r\nJust at the time the last catastrophe occurred they had been intending\r\nto treat themselves to a more ceremonious meal, and were only waiting\r\nuntil the sail should be set, and the boat gliding along her course, to\r\nenter upon the eating of it.\r\n\r\nThis pleasant design had been frustrated by the flukes of the whale;\r\nwhich, though destroying many other things, had, unfortunately, not\r\ninjured their appetites.  These were keen enough when they first\r\nreoccupied their old places on the _Catamaran_; but as the day advanced,\r\nand they continued to exert themselves in collecting the fragments of\r\nthe wreck, their hunger kept constantly increasing, until all four\r\nexperienced that appetite as keenly as they had ever done since the\r\ncommencement of their prolonged and perilous \"cruise.\"\r\n\r\nIn this half-famished condition it was not likely they should have any\r\ngreat relish for work; and as soon as they had secured the various\r\nwaifs, against the danger of being carried away, they set themselves to\r\nconsider what chance they had to provide themselves with a fresh stock\r\nof food.\r\n\r\nOf course their thoughts were directed towards the deep, or rather its\r\nfinny denizens.  There was nothing else above, beneath, or around them\r\nthat could have been coupled with the idea of food.\r\n\r\nTheir former success in fishing might have given them confidence,--and\r\nwould have done so but for an unfortunate change that had taken place in\r\ntheir circumstances.\r\n\r\nTheir hooks were among the articles now missing.  The harpoons which\r\nthey had handled with such deadly effect upon the carcass of the\r\n_cachalot_ had been there left,--sticking up out of the back of the dead\r\nleviathan composing that improvised spit erected for roasting the\r\nshark-steaks.  In short, every article of iron,--even to their own\r\nknives, which had been thrown loosely into the boat,--was now at the\r\nbottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThere was not a moiety of metal left out of which they could manufacture\r\na fish-hook; and if there had been it would not have mattered much,\r\nsince they could not discover a scrap of meat sufficient to have baited\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThere seemed no chance whatever of fishing or obtaining fish in any\r\nfashion; and after turning the subject ever and over in their minds,\r\nthey at length relinquished it in despair.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis their thoughts reverted to the _cachalot_,--not the live,\r\nleaping leviathan, whose hostile behaviour had so suddenly blighted\r\ntheir bright prospects; but the dead one, upon whose huge carcass they\r\nhad so lately stood.  There they might still find food,--more\r\nshark-meat.  If not, there was the whale-beef, or blubber: coarse\r\nviands, it is true, but such as may sustain life.  Of that there was\r\nenough to have replenished the larder of a whole ship's crew,--of a\r\nsquadron!\r\n\r\nIt was just possible they could find their way back to it, for the wind,\r\ndown which they had been running, was still in the same quarter; and the\r\nwhole distance they had made during the night might in time be\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nAt the best, it would have been a difficult undertaking and doubtful of\r\nsuccess, even if there had been no other obstacle than the elements\r\nstanding in their way.\r\n\r\nBut there was,--one more dreaded than either the opposition of the wind\r\nor the danger of straying from their course.\r\n\r\nIn all likelihood their pursuers had returned to the spot which they had\r\nforsaken; and might at that very moment be mooring their craft to the\r\nhuge pectoral fin that had carried the cable of the _Catamaran_.\r\n\r\nIn view of this probability, the idea of returning to the dead whale was\r\nscarce entertained, or only to be abandoned on the instant.\r\n\r\nCheerless were the thoughts of the Catamarans as they sat pondering upon\r\nthat important question,--how they were to find food,--cheerless as the\r\nclouds of night that were now rapidly descending over the surface of the\r\nsea, and shrouding them in sombre gloom.\r\n\r\nNever before had they felt so dispirited, and yet never had they been so\r\nnear being relieved from their misery.  It was the darkest hour of their\r\ndespondency, and the nearest to their deliverance; as the darkest hour\r\nof the night is that which precedes the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA CHEERING CUP.\r\n\r\nThey made no attempt to move from the spot upon which the sun saw them\r\nat setting.\r\n\r\nAs yet they had not restored the mast with its sail; and they had no\r\nmotive for toiling at the oar.  All the little way they might make by\r\nrowing was not worth the exertion of making it; and indeed it had now\r\nbecome a question whether there was any use in attempting to continue\r\ntheir westward course.  There was not the slightest chance of reaching\r\nland before starvation could overtake them; and they might as well\r\nstarve where they were.  Death in that shape would not be more endurable\r\nin one place than another; and it would make no difference under what\r\nmeridian they should depend the last few minutes of their lives.\r\n\r\nInto such a state of mind had these circumstances now reduced them,--a\r\nstupor of despair rather than the calmness of resignation.\r\n\r\nAfter some time had been passed in this melancholy mood,--passed under\r\ndarkness and in sombre silence,--a slight circumstance partially aroused\r\nthem.  It was the voice of the sailor, proposing \"supper!\"  One hearing\r\nhim might have supposed that he too had taken leave of his senses.  Not\r\nso, nor did his companions so judge him.  They knew what he meant by the\r\nword, and that the assumed tone of cheerfulness in which he pronounced\r\nit had been intended to cheer them.  Ben's proposal was not without some\r\nsignificance; though to call it \"supper\" of which it was designed they\r\nshould partake was making a somewhat figurative use of the phrase.\r\n\r\nNo matter; it meant something,--something to supply the place of a\r\nsupper,--if not so substantial as they would have wished, at least\r\nsomething that would not only prolong their lives, but for a while\r\nlighten their oppressed spirits.  It meant a cup of Canary.\r\n\r\nThey had not forgotten their possession of this.  Had they done so, they\r\nmight have yielded to even a deeper despair.  A small quantity of the\r\nprecious grape-juice was still within the cask, safe stowed in its old\r\nlocker.  They had hitherto abstained from touching it, with the view of\r\nkeeping it to the last moment that it could be conveniently hoarded.\r\nThat moment seemed to Ben Brace to have arrived, when he proposed a cup\r\nof Canary for their supper.\r\n\r\nOf course no objection was made to a proposition equally agreeable to\r\nall; and the stopper was taken from the cask.\r\n\r\nThe little measure of horn, which had been found floating among the\r\n_debris_ of the wrecked gig, was carefully inserted upon its string,\r\ndrawn out filled with the sweet wine, and then passed from lip to lip,--\r\nthe pretty lips of the Lilly Lalee being the first to come in contact\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nThe \"dipping\" was several times repeated; and then the stopper was\r\nrestored to its place, and without any further ceremony, the \"supper\"\r\ncame to an end.\r\n\r\nWhether from the invigorating effects of the wine, or whether from that\r\nnatural reaction of spirits ever consequent on a \"spell\" of despondency,\r\nboth the sailor and Snowball, after closing the cask, began to talk over\r\nplans for the future.  Hope, however slight, had once more made entry\r\ninto their souls.\r\n\r\nThe subject of their discourse was whether they should not forthwith\r\nre-step the mast and set the sail.  The night was as dark as pitch, but\r\nthat signified little.  They could manipulate the \"sticks,\" ropes, and\r\ncanvas without light; and as to the lashings that would be required,\r\nthere could be no difficulty in making them good, if the night had been\r\nten times darker than it was.  This was a trope used by Snowball on the\r\noccasion, regardless of its physical absurdity.\r\n\r\nOne argument which the sailor urged in favour of action was, that by\r\nmoving onward they could do no harm.  They might as well be in motion as\r\nat rest, since, with the sail as their motive power, it would require no\r\nexertion on their part.  Of course this reasoning was purely negative,\r\nand might not have gone far towards convincing the Coromantee,--whose\r\nfatalist tendencies at times strongly inclined him to inaction.  But his\r\ncomrade backed it by another argument, of a more positive kind, to which\r\nSnowball more readily assented.\r\n\r\n\"By keepin' on'ard,\" said Ben, \"we'll be more like to come in sight o'\r\nsomethin',--if there be anythin' abroad.  Besides, if we lay here like a\r\nlog, we'll still be in danger o' them ruffians driftin' down on us.  Ye\r\nknow they be a win'ard, an' ha' got theer sail set,--that is, if they\r\nbean't gone back to the sparmacety, which I dar say they've done.  In\r\nthat case there moutn't be much fear o' 'em; but whether or no, it be\r\nbest for us to make sure.  I say let's set the sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Berra well, Massa Brace,\" rejoined the Coromantee, whose opposition had\r\nbeen only slight.  \"Dar am troof in wha you hab 'ledged.  Ef you say set\r\nde sail, I say de same.  Dar am a lubbly breeze bowlum.  'Pose we 'tick\r\nup de mass dis berry instam ob time?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" rejoined the sailor.  \"Bear a hand, my hearties, and let's\r\ngo at it!  The sooner we spread the canvas the better.\"\r\n\r\nNo further words passed, except some muttered phrases of direction or\r\ncommand proceeding from the captain of the _Catamaran_ while engaged\r\nwith his crew in stepping the mast.  This done, the yard was hauled\r\n\"apeak,\" the \"sheets\" drawn \"taut\" and \"belayed,\" and the wet canvas,\r\nspread out once more, became filled with the breeze, and carried the\r\ncraft with a singing sound through the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nA PHANTOM SHIP OR A SHIP ON FIRE?\r\n\r\nWith the _Catamaran_ once more under sail, and going on her due course,\r\nher crew might have seemed restored to the situation held by them\r\nprevious to their encountering the dead _cachalot_ Unfortunately for\r\nthem, this was far from being the case.\r\n\r\nA change for the worse had occurred in their circumstances.  Then they\r\nwere \"victualled\"--if not to full rations, at least with stores\r\ncalculated to last them for some time.  They were provided, moreover,\r\nwith certain weapons and implements that might be the means of\r\nreplenishing their stores in the event of their falling short.\r\n\r\nNow it was altogether different.  The _Catamaran_ was as true and\r\nseaworthy as ever, her \"rig\" as of yore, and her sailing qualities not\r\nin the least impaired.  But her \"fitting out\" was far inferior,\r\nespecially in the \"victualling department\"; and this weighed heavily\r\nupon the minds of her crew.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the depression of their spirits, which soon returned\r\nagain, they could not resist an inclination for sleep.  It is to be\r\nremembered that they had been deprived of this on the preceding night\r\nthrough the violence of the gale, and that they had got but very little\r\non the night before that from being engaged in scorching their\r\nshark-meat.\r\n\r\nExhausted nature called loudly for repose; and so universally, that the\r\ncomplete crew yielded to the call, not even one of them remaining in\r\ncharge of the helm.\r\n\r\nIt had been agreed upon that the craft should be left to choose its own\r\ntrack; or rather, that which the wind might select for it.\r\n\r\nGuided by the breath of heaven, and by that alone, did the _Catamaran_\r\ncontinue her course.\r\n\r\nHow much way she made thus left alone to herself is not written down in\r\nher \"log.\"  The time alone is recorded; and we are told that it was the\r\nhour of midnight before any individual of her crew awoke from that\r\nslumber, to which \"all hands\" had surrendered after setting her sail.\r\n\r\nThe first of them who awoke was little William.  The sailor-lad was not\r\na heavy sleeper at any time, and on this night in particular his\r\nslumbers had been especially _unsound_.  There was trouble on his mind\r\nbefore going to sleep, an uneasiness of no ordinary kind.  It was not\r\nany fear for his own fate.  He was a true English tar in miniature, and\r\ncould not have been greatly distressed with any apprehensions of a\r\npurely selfish nature.  Those that harassed him were caused by his\r\nconsideration for another,--for Lilly Lalee.\r\n\r\nFor days he had been observing a change in the appearance of the child.\r\nHe had noticed the gradual paling of her cheek, and rapid attenuation of\r\nher form,--the natural consequence of such a terrible exposure to one\r\naccustomed all her days to a delicate and luxurious mode of existence.\r\n\r\nOn that day in particular, after the fearful shock they had all\r\nsustained, the young Portuguese girl had appeared,--at least, in the\r\neyes of little William,--more enfeebled than ever; and the boy-sailor\r\nhad gone to sleep under a sad foreboding that she would be the first to\r\nsuccumb,--and that soon,--to the hardships they were called upon to\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nLittle William loved Lilly Lalee with such love as a lad may feel for\r\none of his own age,--a love perhaps the sweetest in life, if not the\r\nmost lasting.\r\n\r\nInspired by this juvenile passion, and by the apprehensions he had for\r\nits object, the boy-sailor did not sleep very soundly.\r\n\r\nFortunate that it was so; else that brilliant flame that near the\r\nmid-hours of night glared athwart the deck of the _Catamaran_ might not\r\nhave awakened him; and had it not done so, neither he nor his three\r\ncompanions might ever again have looked upon human face except their\r\nown, and that only to see one another expire in the agonies of death.\r\n\r\nThere was a flame far lighting up the sombre surface of the ocean that\r\nshone upon the sleepy Catamarans.  Gleaming in the half-closed eye of\r\nthe sailor-lad, it awoke him.\r\n\r\nStarting up, he beheld an apparition, which caused him surprise, not\r\nunmingled with alarm.  It was a ship beyond doubt,--or the semblance of\r\none,--but such as the sailor-lad had never before seen.\r\n\r\nShe appeared to be on fire.  Vast clouds of smoke were rising up from\r\nher decks, and rolling away over her stern, illuminated by columns of\r\nbright flame that jetted up forward of her foremast, almost to the\r\nheight of her lower shrouds.  No man unaccustomed to such a sight could\r\nhave looked upon that ship without supposing that she was on fire.\r\n\r\nLittle William should have been able to judge of what he saw.\r\nUnfortunately for himself, the spectacle of a ship on fire was not new\r\nto him.  He had witnessed the burning of the bark which had borne him\r\ninto the middle of the Atlantic, and left him where he now was, in a\r\nposition of extremest peril.\r\n\r\nBut the memory of that conflagration did not assist him in determining\r\nthe character of the spectacle now before his eyes.  On the decks of the\r\n_Pandora_ he had seen men endeavouring to escape from the flames, in\r\nevery attitude of wild terror.  On the ship now in sight he beheld the\r\nvery reverse.  He saw human beings standing in front of the column of\r\nfire, not only unconcerned at its proximity, but apparently feeding the\r\nflames!\r\n\r\nIt was a spectacle to startle the most experienced mariner, and call\r\nforth the keenest alarm,--a sight to suggest the double\r\ninterrogatory,--\"Is it a phantom ship, or a ship on fire?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETY NINE.\r\n\r\nA WHALER \"TRYING-OUT.\"\r\n\r\nIn making the observations above detailed, the boy-sailor had been\r\noccupied scarce ten seconds of time,--only while his eye took in the\r\nsingular spectacle thus abruptly brought before it.  He did not stay to\r\nseek out of his own thoughts an answer to the question that suggested\r\nitself; but giving way to the terrified surprise which the apparition\r\nhad caused him, he raised a shout which instantly awoke his companions.\r\n\r\nEach of the three, on the instant of their awaking, gave utterance to a\r\nquick cry, but their shouts, although heard simultaneously, were\r\nsignificant of very different emotions.  The cry of the girl was simply\r\na scream, expressive of the wildest terror.  That of Snowball was a\r\nconfused mingling of surprise and alarm; while to the astonishment of\r\nWilliam, and the other as well, the utterance of the sailor was a shout\r\nof unrestrained joy, accompanied by the action of suddenly springing to\r\nhis feet,--so suddenly that the _Catamaran_ was in danger of being\r\ncapsized by the abrupt violence of the movement.\r\n\r\nHe did not give them time to ask for an explanation, but on the moment\r\nof getting himself into an erect attitude he commenced a series of\r\nshouts and exclamations, all uttered in the very highest key of which\r\nhis voice was capable.\r\n\r\nAnd among these utterances, and conspicuously intoned, was the\r\nwell-known hail, \"Ship ahoy!\" followed by other nautical phrases,\r\ndenoting the recognition of a ship.\r\n\r\n\"Golly! it am a ship,\" interposed Snowball, \"a ship on de fire!\"\r\n\r\n\"No! no!\" impatiently answered the ex-whalesman, \"nothing o' the sort.\r\nIt's a whaler `tryin'-out' her oil.  Don't you see the men yonder,\r\nstandin' by the try-works, are throwin' in the `scraps'?  Lord o' mercy!\r\nif they should pass us without hearing our hail!  Ship ahoy! whaler\r\nahoy!\"  And the sailor once more put forth his cries with all the power\r\nthat lay in his lungs.\r\n\r\nTo this was added the stentorian voice of the Coromantee, who, quickly\r\ncatching the explanation given by the ex-whalesman, saw the necessity of\r\nmaking himself heard.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the deck of the _Catamaran_ rang with the shouts, \"Ship\r\nahoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whaler ahoy!\" that might have been heard far over the ocean,--much\r\nfarther than the distance at which the strange vessel appeared to be;\r\nbut, to the consternation of those who gave utterance to those cries, no\r\nanswer was returned.\r\n\r\nThey could now distinctly see the ship, and almost everything aboard of\r\nher; for the two columns of flame rising high in forward of her\r\nforemast, out of the huge double furnace of the \"try-works,\" illuminated\r\nnot only the decks of the vessel, but the surface of the sea for miles\r\naround her.\r\n\r\nThey could see rolling sternward immense volumes of thick smoke,\r\ngleaming yellow under the light of the blazing fires; and the figures of\r\nmen looming like giants in the glare of the garish flames,--some\r\nstanding in front of the furnace, others moving about, and actively\r\nengaged in some species of industry, that to the eye of any other than a\r\nwhalesman might have appeared supernatural.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the distinctness with which they saw all these things,\r\nand the evident proximity of the ship, those on the raft could not make\r\nthemselves heard, shout as loudly as they would.\r\n\r\nThis might have appeared strange to the Catamarans, and led them to\r\nbelieve that it was, in reality, a phantom ship they were hailing, and\r\nthe gigantic figures they saw were those of spectres instead of men.\r\n\r\nBut the experience of the ex-whalesman forbade any such belief.  He knew\r\nthe ship to be a whaler, the moving forms to be men,--her crew,--and he\r\nknew, moreover, the reason why these had not answered his hail.  They\r\nhad not heard it.  The roaring of the great furnace fires either drowned\r\nor deadened _every_ other sound; even the voices of the whalesmen\r\nthemselves, as they stood close to each other.\r\n\r\nBen Brace remembered all this; and the thought that the ship might pass\r\nthem, unheard and unheeded, filled his mind with dread apprehension.\r\n\r\nBut for a circumstance in their favour this might have been the\r\nlamentable result.  Fortunately, however, there was a circumstance that\r\nled to a more happy termination of that chance encounter of the two\r\nstrange crafts,--the _Catamaran_ and the whale-ship.\r\n\r\nThe latter, engaged, as appearances indicated, in the process of\r\n\"trying-out\" the blubber of some whale lately harpooned, was \"laying-to\"\r\nagainst the wind; and, of course not making much way, nor caring to make\r\nit, through the water.\r\n\r\nAs she was coming up slowly, her head set almost \"into the wind's eye,\"\r\nthe Catamarans, well to windward, would have no difficulty in getting\r\ntheir craft close up to her.\r\n\r\nThe sailor was not slow in perceiving their advantageous position; and\r\nas soon as he became satisfied that the distance was too great for their\r\nhail to be heard, he sprang to the steering-oar, turned the helm \"hard a\r\nport,\" and set his craft's head on towards the whaler, as if determined\r\nto run her down.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the raft was surging along within a cable's length of\r\nthe whaler's bows, when the cry of \"Ship ahoy!\" was once more raised by\r\nboth Snowball and the sailor.  Though the hail was heard, the reply was\r\nnot instantaneous; for the crew of the whale-ship, guided by the shouts\r\nof those on the raft, had looked forth upon the illumined water, and,\r\nseeing such a strange embarkation right under their bows, were for some\r\nmoments silent through sheer surprise.\r\n\r\nThe ex-whalesman, however, soon made himself intelligible, and in ten\r\nminutes after the crew of the _Catamaran_, instead of shivering in wet\r\nclothes, with hungry stomachs to make them still more miserable, might\r\nhave been seen standing in front of an immense fire, with an ample\r\nsupply of wholesome food set before them, and surrounded by a score of\r\nrude but honest men, each trying to excel the other in contributing to\r\ntheir comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ONE HUNDRED.\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE \"YARN.\"\r\n\r\nOcean Waifs no longer, the crew of the _Catamaran_ became embodied with\r\nthat of the ship, and her little passenger found kindness and protection\r\nin the cabin of the whaler.\r\n\r\nThe _Catamaran_ herself was not \"cut loose\" in the nautical sense of the\r\nterm, and abandoned, but she was cut loose in a literal sense, and in\r\npieces hoisted aboard the ship to be employed for various purposes,--her\r\nropes, spars, and sail to be used at some time as they had been\r\noriginally intended--her other timbers to go to the stock of the\r\ncarpenter, and her casks to the cooper, to be eventually filled with the\r\nprecious sperm-oil which the ship's crew were engaged in trying out.\r\n\r\nThe old whalesman was not long aboard before getting confirmed in his\r\nconjecture that the ship was the same whose boats had harpooned and\r\n\"drogued\" the _cachalot_, the carcass of which had been encountered by\r\nthe _Catamaran_.  It was one of a large \"pod\" of whales, of which the\r\nboats had been in pursuit, and these, along with the ship, having\r\nfollowed its companions to a great distance, and killed several of them\r\nin the chase, had lost all bearings of the one first struck.\r\n\r\nIt had been their intention to go in search of it, as soon as they\r\nshould try out the others that had been captured; and the information\r\nnow given by Ben Brace to the captain of the whaler would enable the\r\nlatter the more easily to discover the lost prize, which he estimated at\r\nthe value of seventy or eighty barrels of oil, and therefore well worth\r\nthe trouble of going back for.  On the day after the castaways had been\r\ntaken aboard, the whale-ship, having extinguished the fires of her\r\ntry-works, started in search of the drogued whale.\r\n\r\nThe ex-crew of the _Catamaran_ had by this time given a full account of\r\ntheir adventures to the whalesmen; at the same time expressing their\r\nbelief that the ruffians on the big raft would be found by the carcass\r\nthey were in search of.  The prospect of such an encounter could not\r\nfail to interest the crew of the whaler; and as they advanced in the\r\ndirection in which they expected to find the drogued _cachalot_, all\r\neyes were bent searchingly upon the sea.\r\n\r\nSo far as the dead whale was concerned, they were successful in their\r\nsearch.  Just as the sun was going down, they came in sight of it; and\r\nbefore the twilight had passed they \"hove to\" along side of it.  The\r\nvast flock of sea birds perched upon the floating mass, and that rose\r\ninto the air as the ship approached them, proclaimed the absence of\r\nhuman beings.  The great raft was not there, nor were there any\r\nindications that it had revisited the carcass.  On the contrary, that\r\ncurious structure, the crane, which the Catamarans had erected on the\r\nsummit of the floating mass, was still standing just as they had left\r\nit; only that the flakes of shark's flesh were scorched to the hue and\r\ntexture of a cinder, and the fire that had burnt them was no longer\r\nblazing beneath.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the slaver's castaway crew did not long remain a mystery.\r\nThree days after, when the carcass of the _cachalot_ had been \"flensed\"\r\nand tried out, and the whaler had once more proceeded upon her cruise,\r\nshe chanced upon a spot where the sea was strewn with a variety of\r\nobjects, among which were two or three spars of a ship, and several\r\nempty water-casks.  In these objects there was no difficulty in\r\nrecognising the wreck of the _Pandora's_ raft, which was drifting at no\r\ngreat distance from the place where they had been cutting up the\r\n_cachalot_.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion was easily arrived at.  The gale, which had been\r\nsuccessfully weathered by the carefully constructed _Catamaran_, had\r\nproved too violent for the larger embarkation, loosely lashed together,\r\nand negligently navigated as it was.  As a consequence it had gone to\r\npieces; while the wretches who had occupied it, not having the strength\r\nto cling either to cask or spar, had indubitably gone to the bottom.  As\r\nlittle William afterwards related--\r\n\r\n\"So perished the slaver's crew.  Not one of them,--either those in the\r\ngig or on the raft, ever again saw the shore.  They perished upon the\r\nface of the wide ocean--miserably perished, without hand to help or eye\r\nto weep over them!\"\r\n\r\nIn truth did it seem as if their destruction had been an act of the\r\nOmnipotent Himself, to avenge the sable-skinned victims of their\r\natrocious cruelty!\r\n\r\nWere it our province to write the after history of the Catamarans, we\r\ncould promise ourselves a pleasant task, perhaps pleasanter than\r\nrecording the cruise of that illustrious craft.\r\n\r\nWe have space only to epitomise.  The day after setting foot upon the\r\ndeck of the whale-ship, Snowball was appointed _chef de caboose_, in\r\nwhich distinguished office he continued for several years; and only\r\nresigned it to accept of a similar situation on board a fine bark,\r\ncommanded by _Captain Benjamin Brace_, engaged in the African trade.\r\nBut not _that African trade_ carried on by such ships as the _Pandora_.\r\nNo; the merchandise transported in Captain Brace's bark was not black\r\nmen, but white ivory, yellow gold-dust, palm-oil, and ostrich-plumes;\r\nand it was said, that, after each \"trip\" to the African coast, the\r\nmaster, as well as owner, of this richly laden bark, was accustomed to\r\nmake a trip to the Bank of England, and there deposit a considerable sum\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nAfter many years spent thus professionally, and with continued success,\r\nthe _ci-devant_ whalesman, man-o'-war's-man, ex-captain of the\r\n_Catamaran_, and master of the African trader, retired from active life;\r\nand, anchored in a snug craft in the shape of a Hampstead Heath villa,\r\nis now enjoying his pipe, his glass of grog, and his _otium cum\r\ndignitate_.\r\n\r\nAs for \"Little William,\" he in turn ceased to be known by this\r\ndesignation.  It was no longer appropriate when he became the captain of\r\na first-class clipper-ship in the East Indian trade,--standing upon his\r\nown quarter-deck full six feet in his shoes, and finely proportioned at\r\nthat,--so well as to both face and figure, that he had no difficulty in\r\ngetting \"spliced\" to a wife that dearly loved him.\r\n\r\nShe was a very beautiful woman, with a noble round eye, jet black waving\r\nhair, and a deep brunette complexion.  Many of his acquaintances were\r\nunder the impression that she had Oriental blood in her veins, and that\r\nhe had brought her home from India on one of his return voyages from\r\nthat country.  Those more intimate with him could give a different\r\naccount,--one received from himself; and which told them that his wife\r\nwas a native of Africa, of Portuguese extraction, and that her name was\r\n_Lalee_.\r\n\r\nThey had heard, moreover, that his first acquaintance with her had\r\ncommenced on board a slave bark; and that their friendship as\r\nchildren,--afterwards ripening into love,--had been cemented while both\r\nwere castaways upon a raft--Ocean Waifs in the middle of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
