Jacob, C.I.E., R.E., and comments on these rules were obtained from\r\nmany experienced engineers and recorded. The author has had the\r\nadvantage of reading all these opinions. Generally the weight of opinion\r\non any point agrees with what most experienced engineers would suggest,\r\nand direct conflicts of opinion scarcely occur. Important papers have\r\nbeen printed by the Punjab Irrigation Branch on Losses of Water and the\r\nDesign of Distributaries, on the great Triple Canal Project, on Gibb’s\r\nModule, on Kennedy’s Gauge Outlet, and on the Lining of Watercourses.\r\nThese papers are not always accessible to engineers, and the chief\r\npoints of interest in them are not, in most cases, discernible at a\r\nglance. Such points have been extracted and are given in this book.\r\n\r\n  E. S.

When the canal flows throughout the year it is called\r\na “Perennial Canal.” Chief among these are the canals of India and\r\nparticularly those of Northern India, some of which have bed widths\r\nranging up to 300 feet, depths of water up to 11 feet and discharges up\r\nto 10,000 c. ft. per second. Other large canals as for instance many of\r\nthose in Scinde, Egypt and the Punjab, though fed from perennial rivers,\r\nflow only when the rivers are high. These are called “Inundation\r\nCanals.” Many canals, generally of moderate or small size, in other\r\ncountries and notably in the Western States of America, in Italy, Spain,\r\nFrance and South Africa, are fed from rivers and great numbers of small\r\ncanals from reservoirs in which streams or rain-water have been\r\nimpounded. Sometimes water for irrigation is pumped from wells and\r\nconveyed in small canals. In Australia a good deal of irrigation is\r\neffected from artesian wells. Irrigation works on a considerable scale\r\nare being undertaken in Mexico and the Argentine. In this book,\r\nirrigation works of various countries are referred to and to some extent\r\ndescribed, but the perennial canal of Northern India, with its\r\ndistributaries, is the type taken as a basis for the description of the\r\nprinciples and methods which should be adopted in the design, working\r\nand improvement of irrigation channels and it is to be understood that\r\nsuch a canal is being referred to where the context does not indicate\r\nthe contrary. Any reader who is concerned with irrigation in some other\r\npart of the world will be able to judge for himself how far these\r\nprinciples and methods require modification. The branches and\r\ndistributaries--all of which are dealt with--of a large perennial canal\r\ncover all possible sizes.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II. of this book deals with the design of canals and CHAPTER\r\nIII. with the working of canals but as the two subjects are to some\r\nextent interdependent, they will both be dealt with in a preliminary\r\nmanner in the remaining articles of the present Chapter. CHAPTER IV.\r\ndescribes the Punjab Triple Canal Project.[1] CHAPTER V. deals with\r\ncertain proposed improvements in the working of canals.\r\n\r\n  [1] The latest example of canal design.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =General Principles of Canal Design.=--The head of a canal has to be\r\nso high up the river that, when the canal is suitably graded, the water\r\nlevel will come out high enough to irrigate the tract of land concerned.\r\nIf a river has a general slope of a foot per mile and if the adjoining\r\ncountry has the same slope and is a foot higher than the water level of\r\nthe river, and if a canal is made at a very acute angle with the river,\r\nwith a slope of half a foot per mile, the water level about two miles\r\nfrom the canal head will be level with the ground.\r\n\r\nThe headworks of the canal consist of a weir--which may be provided with\r\nsluices--across the river, and a head “regulator,” provided with gates,\r\nfor the canal. There are however many canals, those for instance of the\r\ninundation canal class, which have no works in the river and these may\r\ngo dry when the river is low. They usually have a regulator to prevent\r\ntoo much water from going down the canal during floods. If a canal is\r\nfed from a reservoir the headworks consist simply of a sluice or\r\nsluices.\r\n\r\nA canal must be so designed as to bring the water to within reasonable\r\ndistance of every part of the area to be irrigated. Unless the area is\r\nsmall or narrow the canal must have “branches” and “distributaries.” A\r\ngeneral sketch of a large canal is given in Fig. 1. On a large canal,\r\nirrigation is not usually done directly from the canal and branches. It\r\nis all done from the distributaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFrom each distributary “watercourses” take off at intervals and convey\r\nthe water to the fields. A small canal, say one whose length is not more\r\nthan 15 miles or whose discharge is not more than 100 c. feet per\r\nsecond, may be regarded as a distributary and the word distributary will\r\nbe used with this extended meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is not always the case that the whole tract covered by a system of\r\ncanal channels is irrigated. In the case of a canal fed from a river,\r\nthe land near the river is often high or broken and the main canal runs\r\nfor some distance before it reaches the tract to be irrigated. Again,\r\nwithin this tract there are usually portions of land too high to be\r\nirrigated. Those portions of the tract which can be irrigated are called\r\nthe “commanded area.”\r\n\r\nThe channels of a large irrigation system should run on high ground. In\r\nthe case of a distributary, this is necessary in order that the\r\nwater-courses may run downhill, and since the water in the canal and\r\nbranches has to flow into the distributaries, the canal and branches\r\nmust also be in high ground. Another reason for adopting high ground is\r\nthat all the channels should, as far as possible, keep away from the\r\nnatural drainage lines of the country and not obstruct them. Also a\r\nchannel in high ground is cheapest and safest. When a channel is in low\r\nground it must have high banks which are expensive to make and liable to\r\nbreach. Every tract of country possesses more or less defined ridges and\r\nvalleys. When the ridges are well defined, the irrigation channels,\r\nespecially the distributaries, follow them approximately, deviating\r\nslightly on one side or the other from the very top of the ridge in\r\norder to secure a more direct course. If any part of a ridge is so high\r\nas to necessitate deep digging the channel does not necessarily go\r\nthrough it. It may skirt it and return to the crest of the ridge further\r\non, especially if this arrangement shortens the channel or at least does\r\nnot lengthen it much. A channel also goes off the ridge sometimes when\r\nadherence to it would give a crooked line. Of course all the\r\nchannels--canals, branches and distributaries--have to flow more or less\r\nin the direction of the general slope of the tract being dealt with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe alignments of the channels do not, however, depend exclusively on\r\nthe physical features of the country. Centrality in the alignment is\r\ndesirable. It will be shown (CHAP. II. Art. 10) that a distributary\r\nworks most economically when it runs down the centre of the tract which\r\nit has to irrigate. It is better to have short watercourses running off\r\nfrom both sides of a distributary than long watercourses from only one\r\nside. The same is true of a branch; it should run down the centre of its\r\ntract of country. Again the angles at which the channels branch off have\r\nto be considered. If branches were taken off very high up the canal and\r\nran parallel to and not far from it, there would be an excessive length\r\nof channel. But neither should the branches be so arranged as to form a\r\nseries of right angles. In the case shown in Fig. 2 the size of the\r\nmain or central canal would of course be reduced at the point A. By\r\naltering the branches to the positions shown in dotted lines their\r\nlength is not appreciably increased while the length A B is made of the\r\nreduced instead of the full size. Moreover the course B C is more direct\r\nthan BAC and this may be of the greatest importance as regards gaining\r\nthe necessary command. When a channel bifurcates, the total wet border\r\nalways increases and there is then a greater loss from absorption. The\r\nwater is always kept in bulk as long as possible. If the alignment of a\r\nbranch is somewhat crooked it does not follow that straightening\r\nit--supposing the features of the country admit of this--will be\r\ndesirable. It may increase the length of distributaries taken off near\r\nthe bends. It will be shown (CHAP. II. Art. 10) that a distributary\r\nought, when matters can be so arranged, to irrigate the country for two\r\nmiles on either side of it, and watercourses should be two or three\r\nmiles long. A distributary need not therefore extend right up to the\r\nboundary of the commanded area but stop two or three miles from it.\r\nGenerally it is not desirable to prolong a distributary and make it\r\n“tail” into another channel (CHAP. II. Art. 3). A distributary, like a\r\ncanal, may give off branches.\r\n\r\nNone of the rules mentioned in the preceding paragraph are intended to\r\nbe other than general guides, to be followed as far as the physical\r\nfeatures of the country permit, or to assist in deciding between\r\nalternative schemes. It may for instance be a question whether to\r\nconstruct one distributary or two, between two nearly parallel branches.\r\nThe two-mile rule may enable the matter to be decided or it may\r\ninfluence the decision arrived at as to the exact alignments of the\r\nbranches. The flatter the country and the less marked the ridges the\r\nmore the alignment can be based on the above rules. Sometimes, as in the\r\nlow land adjoining a river, the ridges are ill defined or non-existent\r\nand the alignment is based entirely on the above rules. The rule as to\r\nfollowing high ground need not be adhered to at the tail of any\r\ndistributary if all the land to be irrigated at the tail is low and if\r\nthere is a deep drainage line or other feature of the country such as to\r\npreclude the possibility of an extension of the distributary. Possible\r\nextensions should always be considered. In hilly districts an irrigation\r\ncanal may have to run in sidelong ground along the side of a valley.\r\n\r\nIn flat valleys, owing to the land nearest the river having received\r\nsuccessive deposits of silt in floods, the ground generally slopes away\r\nfrom the river and a canal can irrigate the low land even if taken off\r\nat right angles to the river. But to irrigate the high land near the\r\nriver and the land where it rises again towards the hills or watershed,\r\na canal taking off higher up the river is necessary. Of course much\r\ndepends on whether the canal is to irrigate when the river is low or\r\nonly when it is high, and whether or not there is to be a weir in the\r\nriver. In Upper Egypt, it is common for a high level canal taking off\r\nfar upstream, to divide into two branches, one for the land near the\r\nriver and one for the land towards the watershed, and for both branches\r\nto be crossed--by means of syphons--by a low-level canal which irrigates\r\nthe low ground. Similar arrangements sometimes occur on Indian\r\ninundation canals.\r\n\r\nRegulators are usually provided at all off-takes of branches. In the\r\ncase of a channel taking off from another channel many times its own\r\nsize there is generally only the head regulator of the smaller channel\r\nbut in other cases there is a regulator in each channel below the\r\nbifurcation. Thus, when the number of bifurcating channels is two it is\r\ncalled a double regulator. Regulators, with the “falls”--introduced to\r\nflatten the gradients when the slope of the country is too steep--and\r\ndrainage crossings and the bridges, provided at the principal roads,\r\nconstitute the chief masonry works on a canal. At a fall, mills are\r\noften constructed or the fall may be used for electric power.\r\n\r\nRegarding curves and bends in channels, it is explained in _River and\r\nCanal Engineering_ that, as regards increased resistance to flow and\r\nconsequent tendency to silt deposit, curves of fair radius have very\r\nlittle effect, that a curve of a given angle may perhaps have the same\r\neffect whether the radius is great or small but that if the radius is\r\nlarge a succession of curves cannot be got into a short length, that a\r\nsuccession of sharp curves in a short length may have great effect,\r\namounting to an increase of N in Kutter’s co-efficient, that a single\r\nsharp curve has not much effect, that the chief objection to such a\r\ncurve is the tendency to erosion of the bank, that at a place where the\r\nchannel has, in any case, to be protected, as for instance just below a\r\nweir or fall, there is no objection to the introduction of a sharp bend\r\nand that such bends, in fact right-angled elbows, exist without any evil\r\neffects at many regulators when the whole supply is being turned into a\r\nbranch. It is remarkable that on perennial canals no advantage is ever\r\ntaken of the last mentioned fact. Cases undoubtedly occur, though\r\nsomewhat infrequently, in which the most suitable and cheapest\r\narrangement would be to give a canal an abrupt bend at a fall. In order\r\nto reduce eddying, the bend need not be an absolute elbow but can be\r\nmade within the length of the pitching which would be curved instead of\r\nstraight. This is frequently done on inundation canals, without the\r\nslightest drawback, even when there is no fall, the pitching at bridges\r\nbeing utilised. A pitched bend can be made anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen a river floods the country along its banks as in parts of Egypt and\r\nof the Punjab, it is generally necessary to construct marginal\r\nembankments before irrigation can be introduced. The canal may take off\r\nat a point where flooding does not occur or it may pass through the\r\nembankment.[2] If it passes through at a point where flooding occurs, a\r\nmasonry regulator is constructed to prevent the floods from enlarging\r\nthe gap and breaking into the country.\r\n\r\n  [2] For detailed accounts of such embankments and canals see _Punjab\r\n  Rivers and Works_ (Spon) 1912.\r\n\r\nA large canal is provided, so far as is practicable, with “escapes” by\r\nmeans of which surplus water may be let out. Surplus water occurs\r\nchiefly after rain. At such times the demand for water may suddenly be\r\nreduced and if there were no escapes there would probably be serious\r\nbreaches of the banks before there was time for the reduction of water,\r\neffected at the head of the canal, to take effect lower down. There is\r\nusually an escape at some point in the main line, preferably at a point\r\nwhere it divides into branches, and this escape runs back to the river.\r\nThere may also be escapes near the tails of the longest branches. These\r\nescapes may discharge into drainages or into reservoirs formed by\r\nrunning a low embankment round a large area of waste land.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of the whole tract irrigated by a canal must be carefully\r\nseen to. The subsoil water level of a tract of country is nearly always\r\nraised by an irrigation canal. The rise near to a canal or distributary\r\nis due to percolation from the channel and is inevitable.[3] The rise at\r\nplaces further away, if it occurs, is due to over-watering or to neglect\r\nof drainage. Immense damage has been done by “water-logging” of the soil\r\nwhen irrigation water has been supplied to a tract of flat country and\r\nthe clearance and improvement of the natural drainages has not been\r\nattended to. Any drainages crossed by the banks of the irrigation\r\nchannels should be provided with syphons or aqueducts or else the\r\ndrainage diverted into another channel. Very frequently the main line of\r\na canal--whether great or small--in the upper reaches near the hills,\r\nhas to cross heavy drainage channels or torrents and large and expensive\r\nworks are required for this.\r\n\r\n  [3] But see Chap. V. as to reduction of percolation.\r\n\r\nNear the head of a canal and of every branch and distributary, there is\r\nan ordinary gauge which shows the depth of water and is read daily. The\r\ngauge near the head of a main canal is generally self-registering.\r\n\r\nThe principles sketched out in this article are those generally followed\r\nin the designs of modern canals. They have by no means been followed in\r\nall cases. In some of the older Indian canals both the canal and the\r\ndistributaries ran in low ground. Water-courses took off direct from the\r\ncanals, and the irrigation did not generally extend far from the canal.\r\nIn fact long distributaries were impracticable because they would have\r\nrun into high ground. The banks of the channels obstructed drainages and\r\ncaused pestilential swamps. Most canals of this type have been\r\nabolished since the advent of British rule and replaced by others\r\nproperly designed. Some badly designed canals however, mostly of the\r\ninundation class, still exist but in very dry tracts where drainages are\r\nof little consequence.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Information Concerning Canals.=--Nearly all canal irrigation is done\r\nby “flow,” the water running from the water-courses onto the fields, but\r\na small proportion is done by “lift.” This is done in the case of high\r\npieces of land, the lifting being usually done by pumps or, in the east,\r\nby bullocks or by manual labour.\r\n\r\nIrrigation generally consists in giving the land a succession of\r\nwaterings, one previous to ploughing and others after the crop is sown,\r\neach watering being of quite moderate depth. On inundation canals in\r\nIndia the waterings for the summer crop are thus effected but for the\r\nwinter crop the land is deeply soaked during the flood season and is\r\nafterwards ploughed and sown. In Upper Egypt this system is emphasised,\r\nthe water flowing into vast basins, formed by dykes, where it stands for\r\nsome time and, after depositing its silt, is drained off.\r\n\r\nUntil recent times the whole of the irrigation of Egypt was basin\r\nirrigation. In Lower Egypt the construction of the Nile barrage led to\r\nthe introduction of canals which take off at a proper level and their\r\nworking is not restricted to the period when the river is in flood. In\r\nUpper Egypt most of the irrigation is still basin irrigation but the\r\ncanals taking off above the Assiut barrage form a notable exception. By\r\nmeans of the Assouan dam which crosses the Nile, the water during the\r\nlatter part of the flood season and after the floods are over, i.e. from\r\nNovember to March, is ponded up and a vast reservoir formed and the\r\nimpounded water is let down the river in May and June.\r\n\r\nIn some of the older irrigation canals of India the velocity was too\r\nhigh and the channels have since had to be remodelled and the crests of\r\nweirs raised or new weirs built. The more recent canals are free from\r\ngrave defects of this kind but every canal undergoes changes of some\r\nkind and finality has never yet been quite attained.\r\n\r\nOn some Indian irrigation canals made about 30 years ago, great sums of\r\nmoney were wasted in making the canals navigable. There is nothing like\r\nenough navigation to pay for the extra cost. The idea has now been quite\r\ngiven up except as regards timber rafting from upstream. This requires\r\nno curtailment of the velocity in the channels. The requirements of the\r\nirrigation and navigation were always in conflict. The mere fact that\r\nbranches have to be worked in turns is enough to prevent navigation\r\nsucceeding.\r\n\r\nIn India the water used for irrigation is paid for, not according to the\r\nvolume used but according to the area irrigated. The volume used in any\r\nparticular watercourse is not known. The areas sown are measured.\r\nCertain kinds of crops use up more water than others and the charges are\r\nfixed accordingly.\r\n\r\nIn the canals which have their headworks among the mountains of Western\r\nAmerica there are frequent tunnels and syphons and the canals often run\r\nin steep sidelong ground. There are great lengths of tunnel and syphon\r\nin the Marseilles and Verdun Canals and there are long tunnels in the\r\nPeriyar Canal in Madras and in the Upper Swat Canal in the North West\r\nFrontier Province of India.\r\n\r\nThe Tieton Canal, Washington, U.S.A., traverses steep sidelong ground\r\nwhich would be liable to slip if a large cutting were made. The\r\ncross-section of the channel is a circle, 8-ft. 3¹⁄₂-ins. in diameter,\r\nwith the upper part removed, so that the depth is 6 feet. It is made of\r\nreinforced concrete 4 inches thick and the sides are tied together by\r\niron bars which run across the channel above the water. In the Santa Ana\r\nCanal the channel consists for 2¹⁄₂ miles of a flume made of wooden\r\n“staves.”\r\n\r\nA canal constructed in Wyoming, U.S.A., after taking off from a river,\r\npasses through a tunnel into another valley and is turned into another\r\nstream which thus becomes the canal. This is said to save loss of water\r\nby percolation. The stream is winding while a canal could have been made\r\nstraighter. There may, owing to the ground near the stream being\r\nsaturated, have been less loss of water at first than there would have\r\nbeen in the artificial channel but, owing to the smaller wetted area,\r\nthere would probably have been an eventual saving in adopting the\r\nlatter. The real advantage of adopting the natural stream was probably a\r\nsaving in the cost of construction. (_Min. Proc. Inst. C.E._ Vol.\r\nCLXII.)\r\n\r\nIrrigation from canals which are supplied from reservoirs differs in no\r\nrespect from that from other canals. The principles on which reservoir\r\ncapacities should be calculated and earthen and masonry dams constructed\r\nare given in _River and Canal Engineering_. Sometimes, as for instance\r\nwhen a reservoir becomes seriously reduced in size owing to silt\r\ndeposit, the water is run off after the bed of the reservoir has been\r\nsoaked, and crops are grown on the soaked soil.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the water of a canal as between the main channel and\r\nthe branches, is effected by means of the regulators at the\r\nbifurcations. When the supply is ample and the demand great, the\r\nchannels may all be running nearly full. When the demand exceeds the\r\nsupply, the water may be reduced proportionately in each branch but this\r\nmay result in the water of a branch being too low to give proper\r\nsupplies to the distributaries or some of them, and in the water of a\r\ndistributary not commanding the higher ground. Moreover it violates the\r\nprinciple of keeping the water in bulk as far as possible. It is more\r\nusual to give each branch full supply, or a certain large fraction of\r\nthe full supply, in turn, and similarly with the distributaries.\r\n\r\nThe method of distribution from a distributary to the watercourses\r\nvaries. In many modern canals there is, at each watercourse head, a\r\nsluice which is adjusted at frequent intervals according to the supply\r\nand the demand. One method, which is excellent because it fulfils in the\r\nhighest degree the principle of keeping the water in bulk, is to have\r\nvery large watercourses and, by means of regulators which are built at\r\nfrequent intervals, to turn the whole of the water of the distributary\r\ninto a few watercourses at a time, beginning with those nearest the head\r\nof the distributary and working downstream. But a system which seems\r\neminently suitable may be impracticable because of local circumstances.\r\nIn India, any such arrangement would need an army of officials and would\r\nlead to unbounded corruption.\r\n\r\nIn India the water from a distributary enters the watercourses through\r\n“outlets” which are small masonry tubes passing through the banks of the\r\ndistributary. There is no easy way of closing these outlets or at least\r\nof keeping them closed if the cultivators choose to open them, but it is\r\neasy to close a whole distributary and so regulate the supply. This is\r\nthe chief reason why watercourses in India do not usually take off\r\ndirect from the canals.\r\n\r\nThe presence of silt in the water of a river from which a canal is drawn\r\nis often spoken of as being a great evil. If it is an evil at all it is\r\na very mixed evil. The deposits of silt in the channels have been\r\nenormously reduced by the application of scientific principles of\r\ndesign. The clayey silt which remains in the water and reaches the\r\nfields, brings to them greatly increased fertility.\r\n\r\nIn India the fertility of the soil is often reduced or destroyed by the\r\nformation on the surface of the ground of an efflorescence called “reh.”\r\nIt consists of various salts or compounds of sodium and occurs chiefly\r\nwhere there is an impervious layer of subsoil. The salts exist as an\r\ningredient of the upper soil. This becomes saturated with rain or canal\r\nwater and as the water evaporates the salts are left on the surface.\r\nRemedies are drainage, or flooding the soil and running the water off,\r\nor deep tilling, or chemical treatment with lime or gypsum. (_Indian\r\nEngineering, 8th Jan., 1910_).\r\n\r\nThe inundation canals of the Punjab have been described in _Punjab\r\nRivers and Works_. All descriptions and remarks in the present book\r\nregarding Indian canals must be assumed to refer to perennial canals\r\nunless the contrary is stated or implied.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Losses of Water.=--When water flows or stands in an earthen channel\r\nor tank, or is spread over a field, losses occur from evaporation,\r\npercolation and absorption. Of these, absorption is by far the most\r\nimportant and, unless the contrary is stated or implied, it will be\r\ntaken to include the others. The losses by evaporation are very small.\r\nThe loss by evaporation from the surface of the water, even in the hot\r\nseason in India when a hot wind often blows, does not exceed half an\r\ninch in 24 hours and on the average in India is only about a tenth of an\r\ninch in 24 hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nPercolation and absorption are described as follows by Beresford in\r\n_Punjab Irrigation Paper_, No. 10, “The Irrigation Duty of Water.”\r\nPercolation consists in flow through the interstices of boulders,\r\nshingle, gravel or coarse sand. The flow is similar to that in pipes.\r\nThe water percolating into the soil from a channel, extends downwards\r\nand spreads outwards as it descends. None of it goes upwards. In fine\r\nsand and ordinary soil the interstices act like capillary tubes. The\r\nwater is absorbed as by a sponge and it remains in the soil by virtue of\r\ncapillarity. Owing to the combined action of capillarity and gravity the\r\nwater spreads in the manner shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 3. The\r\namount of absorption from a channel will be greater the greater the area\r\nof the wetted surface. In a high embankment with narrow banks, the\r\nabsorption ceases when the water reaches the outer slopes, except in so\r\nfar as it is evaporated from the slopes. Moreover high embankments are\r\ngenerally in clayey soil. If banks of sand are constructed on a layer of\r\nclay (Fig. 4.) and well rammed, the absorption ceases as soon as the\r\nbanks are saturated and the channel then holds water as well as any\r\nother except for evaporation from the outer slopes, but if the bed and\r\nsubsoil are also of sand the absorption of the water will be far\r\ngreater. Absorption ceases when the water extends nearly down to the\r\nlevel of the subsoil water, i.e., to a point where the effect of\r\nabsorption from above plus gravitation is equal to the effect of\r\nabsorption from below minus gravitation. If a bottle is filled with\r\nwater and a small sponge jammed into the neck and the bottle turned\r\nupside down, the sponge becomes saturated but no water will be given\r\nout. But if a dry sponge is placed in contact with the wet one it will\r\nabsorb moisture until saturated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\nIt is known that the loss of water is greatly influenced by the nature\r\nof the soil. When water is turned into a dry channel or onto a field,\r\nthe loss is at first great. It decreases hourly and daily and eventually\r\nbecomes nearly constant, tending to reach a fixed amount when the water\r\nextends down to nearly the level of the subsoil water. Observations made\r\nby Kennedy on loamy fields near the Bari Doab Canal in India showed that\r\non a field previously dry the rate of absorption is given by the\r\nequation\r\n\r\n  _y_ = ·0891_x_^{·86.}\r\n\r\nWhere _y_ is the depth of water absorbed in feet and _x_ is the time in\r\nhours. The observations extended over eight days. Denoting by _c_ the\r\ndepth of water in feet absorbed in one hour, it was found that on a\r\nfield on which no rain had fallen for two months, _c_ was ·04 to ·05 but\r\non the second watering of the crop about a month later _c_ was ·02 to\r\n·03 and about the same on a third watering. It was found that at the\r\nfirst commencement the rate of absorption was much affected by the state\r\nof the surface of the ground but that the effect was only temporary. The\r\nlosses were found to be as follows:\r\n\r\n  +------+--------------+---------------+\r\n  | DAY. |LOSS PER DAY. | LOSS PER HOUR.|\r\n  |      |              |     (_c_)     |\r\n  +------+--------------+---------------+\r\n  |      |       Feet.  |     Feet.     |\r\n  | 1st  |       1·36   |     ·057      |\r\n  | 2nd  |       1·13   |     ·047      |\r\n  | 3rd  |       1·07   |     ·046      |\r\n  | 4th  |       1·02   |     ·043      |\r\n  | 5th  |        ·96   |     ·041      |\r\n  | 6th  |        ·90   |     ·037      |\r\n  | 7th  |        ·80   |     ·033      |\r\n  | 8th  |        ·77   |     ·032      |\r\n  |      | Total 8·01   |               |\r\n  +------+--------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nIn the eight days the total loss was almost exactly eight feet.\r\n\r\nThe losses by absorption in the various channels of certain canals has\r\nbeen estimated to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------+----------+-------+-----------+---------------\r\n     Channel.    | Nature|Mean depth| Value |  Loss per |   Remarks.\r\n                 |  of   | of water |   of  |  Million  |\r\n                 | soil. |    in    | (_c_) |square feet|\r\n                 |       |  Channel.|       | of wetted |\r\n                 |       |          |       |  surface. |\r\n  ---------------+-------+----------+-------+-----------+---------------\r\n                 |       |   Feet.  |       |   c. ft.  |\r\n                 |       |          |       |  per sec. |\r\n  Main Line Upper|Shingle|     6    |·035   |    9·7   }|\r\n  Bari Doab Canal|and    |          |       |          }|\r\n                 |Sandy  |          |       |          }|\r\n                 |Soil   |          |       |          }|\r\n                 |       |          |       |          }|Fairly reliable\r\n  Main Line      |Sandy  |     7    |       |    9·0   }|estimates based\r\n  Sirhind Canal  |Soil   |          |       |          }|on discharge\r\n                 |       |          |       |          }|observations.\r\n  Branches Upper |Loam   |          |·0079  |    2·2   }|\r\n  Bari Doab Canal|       |          |       |          }|\r\n                 |       |          |       |          }|\r\n  Branches       |Sandy  |          |       |    5·2   }|\r\n  Sirhind Canal  |Soil   |          |       |          }|\r\n                 |       |          |       |           |\r\n  Distributaries |Loam   |          |·012[4]|2·3 to 4·4}|\r\n  Upper Bari     |       |          |       | (average }|\r\n  Doab Canal     |       |          |       |   3·3)   }|\r\n                 |       |          |       |          }|\r\n  Distributaries |Sandy  |          |       |  5 to 12 }|\r\n  Sirhind Canal  |Soil   |          |       | (average }|\r\n                 |       |          |       |   8·0)   }|Somewhat rough\r\n                 |       |          |       |          }|estimates.\r\n  Watercourses   |Loam   |          |·015[4]| 3·3 to 20}|\r\n  Upper Bari     |       |          |   to  | (average }|\r\n  Doab Canal     |       |          |·045[5]|   9·4)   }|\r\n                 |       |          |       |          }|\r\n  Watercourses   |Sandy  |          |       | 7 to 60  }|\r\n  Sirhind Canal  |Soil   |          |       | (average }|\r\n                 |       |          |       |   22)    }|\r\n  ---------------+-------+----------+-------+----------+----------------\r\n\r\n  [4] When the channel was in continuous flow.\r\n\r\n  [5] Maximum value when flow was intermittent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome information as to losses of water is also given in CHAPTER IV. Art.\r\n2.\r\n\r\nThe relative losses of water in the channels of the Upper Bari Doab\r\nCanal were as follows:--\r\n\r\n                             Relative Loss.\r\n  In main line and branches        20\r\n  In distributaries                 6\r\n  In watercourses                  21\r\n  Used in the fields               53\r\n                                  ---\r\n                            Total 100\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the great variation in the value of _c_ are not properly\r\nknown. The depth of water is not likely to have much influence on it. It\r\nis well known that the fine silt carried by the water tends to render\r\nthe channels watertight when it deposits. The canals and branches\r\nreceive either no deposits or deposits consisting chiefly of sand. The\r\ndistributaries, especially in their lower reaches, receive deposits of\r\nfine silt which is only occasionally cleared away. The watercourses\r\nreceive similar deposits but they are very frequently cleared out by the\r\ncultivators. This is perhaps the reason why the rate of loss of water in\r\nthe watercourses is nearly three times as great as the rate of loss in\r\nthe distributaries of the same canal. On the Sirhind canal the\r\ndistributaries have more branches than on the Bari Doab canal and the\r\nwatercourses are smaller. This accounts for the different relative\r\nlosses in the two cases. The sandy nature of the soil on the Sirhind\r\ncanal accounts for the general higher value of _c_ on that canal.\r\n\r\nThe following formula has been deduced as giving the loss by absorption\r\non a Punjab Canal.\r\n\r\n                 WL\r\n  P = 3·5 √d ---------\r\n             1,000,000\r\n\r\nWhere P is the loss by absorption in c. ft. per second in a reach whose\r\nlength is L, width (at water level) W and depth d. According to the\r\nformula the loss per million square feet is 10·5 c. ft. per second when\r\nd is 4 ft. and 7 c. ft. per second when d is 2 feet, These figures do\r\nnot agree with those in the preceding table and it is clear that there\r\nare not yet sufficient data from which to construct a formula.\r\n\r\nThe first steps taken on the Bari Doab Canal, and subsequently on other\r\ncanals, to reduce the losses of water, consisted in the reduction in the\r\nnumber of watercourses. This will be referred to again (CHAPTER II. Art.\r\n9). Further steps will be considered in CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Duty of Water.=--The number of acres irrigated annually by a\r\nconstant discharge of 1 c. ft. of water per second is called the “duty”\r\nof water. In India on perennial canals the duty may be as much as 250 or\r\neven 300 acres. On inundation canals which flow for only five months in\r\nthe year and are situated in tracts of scanty rainfall and light or\r\nsandy soil, the duty may be only 70 acres. The duties of most existing\r\ncanals whether in India or elsewhere, are known only approximately. The\r\nduty is calculated on the average discharge entering the canal at its\r\nhead less the water which is passed out at escapes. It thus includes all\r\nlosses of water. The duty varies not only as between one canal and\r\nanother but on the same canal from year to year. It depends on the\r\ncharacter of the soil, a sandy soil requiring more water than a clayey\r\nsoil. It also depends on the rainfall. A moderate amount of rain causes\r\nthe canal water to go further, but heavy rain may enable some crops to\r\ndo without canal water or may permit of the concealment of canal\r\nirrigation. The duty also depends on the kind of crops grown, on the\r\nlosses in the channels by absorption and on the quantity of water\r\navailable. A liberal supply of water leads to carelessness in the use,\r\nbut a very restricted supply is largely wasted owing to the shortness of\r\nthe “turns” or rotational periods of flow in the different channels.\r\n\r\nThere is an obvious connection between the duty of water and the total\r\ndepth of the water, known in India as “delta,” given to the fields.\r\nCalculations are much simplified, while still being accurate enough for\r\nall practical purposes, by assuming that the number of seconds, (86,400)\r\nin a day is twice the number of square feet, (43,560) in an acre.\r\nAssuming this to be the case a discharge of 1 c. ft. per second for a\r\nday gives 2 acre-feet, i.e., it will cover an acre of ground to a depth\r\nof 2 feet in a day; and in six months it will cover 100 acres to depth\r\nof 3·65 feet. In Northern India the year is divided into two halves in\r\neach of which a crop is grown and the duty is calculated for each crop.\r\nIn this case, if the flow of a canal has been continuous, a duty of 100\r\nacres per cubic foot of its mean discharge per second, corresponds to a\r\ntotal depth of 3·65 feet over the area irrigated. Generally the flow in\r\nthe half-year has not been continuous. In other countries, and in India\r\non canals other than the perennial canals, the periods of flow vary a\r\ngreat deal. The duty cannot be calculated from delta or _vice versa_\r\nuntil the period of flow is stated.\r\n\r\nThe daily gauge-readings and daily discharges corresponding to them,\r\nhaving been booked, the discharges are added up. The total, divided by\r\nthe number of days on which the canal has been running, gives the\r\naverage daily discharge. Suppose that during the “kharif” or summer crop\r\nwhich is considered to last from 1st April to 30th September or 183\r\ndays, the canal was closed for 13 days and that the total of the daily\r\ndischarges on the remaining 170 days comes to 850,000 c. ft. per second.\r\nThe average daily discharge is 5,000 c. ft. per second. Suppose the\r\nkharif area irrigated to be 500,000 acres, the kharif duty is 100 acres.\r\nTo find delta the total of the daily discharges has to be multiplied by\r\nthe number of seconds in a day and divided by the number of square feet\r\nin an acre (these figures are, as already stated, very nearly in the\r\nratio of two to one) and divided again by the number of acres irrigated.\r\nThus, in the above case, delta is very nearly 850,000 × 2/500,000 or 3·4\r\nfeet. For comparing the results of one canal or one year with another,\r\ndelta is the more convenient figure to take. As soon as the areas\r\nirrigated by the canals are known for any crop, the Chief Engineer of\r\nthe province issues a statement of the value of delta for each perennial\r\ncanal and compares them with those for previous years. The value of\r\ndelta for the Punjab canals ranges from 3 to 4 feet for the kharif and\r\nfrom 1·8 to 2·1 feet for the “rabi” or winter crop. Individual canals\r\nvary greatly, the worst having nearly twice as high a figure as the\r\nbest. The differences are due to the causes already mentioned.\r\n\r\nAlthough the figures of duty take no account of the number of days a\r\ncanal was closed, they are the most convenient standard for judging\r\ngenerally of the work likely to be done by a projected canal. It will\r\nreadily be seen that figures of duty are not exact and are only an\r\napproximate guide. The delta figures are, on the perennial canals of the\r\nPunjab, also worked out for each month of the crop, the volume of water\r\nused from the beginning of the crop up to the end of the month being\r\ndivided by the area irrigated up to the end of the month. But when\r\nirrigation is in full swing, some little delay occurs in booking the\r\nfields. Moreover the same field is watered a number of times during the\r\ncrop and much depends on whether waterings have just been given or are\r\njust about to be given. The figures are useful to some extent for\r\ncomparison. The figures for the rabi crop of 1908-09 were as follows,\r\nthe figure for March being the final figure for the crop.\r\n\r\n  Up to end of                 Oct.,  Nov.,  Dec.,  Jan.,  Feb.,  March.\r\n  Progressive value of delta.  1·69   1·34   1·29   1·47   1·71   2·05.\r\n\r\nOne great principle to be followed in order to obtain a high duty is to\r\nrestrict the supply of water. A cultivator whose watercourse is always\r\nrunning full may waste great quantities of water, but if he knows that\r\nit is only to run for a few days out of a fortnight he will use the\r\nwater carefully. It is not, of course, meant that the water kept back is\r\nrun into escapes and wasted. It goes to irrigate other lands. The\r\navailable supply of water should be spread over as large an area of land\r\nas just, and only just, to suffice.[6] Other methods of improving the\r\nduty are the reduction in the number of watercourses, the apportionment\r\nof the sizes of outlets, watercourses and distributaries to the work\r\nthat they have to do, careful attention to the distribution of the water\r\nand the prevention of wastage due to carelessness.\r\n\r\n  [6] A system of lavish supply is in most cases likely to lead to harm\r\n  by water-logging of the soil or its exhaustion by over-cropping or to\r\n  raising of the spring level and injury to the public health.\r\n\r\nThe following information concerning duties is taken from Buckley’s\r\nIrrigation Pocket Book:--\r\n\r\n  +---------------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n  |      PLACE.         | RABI DUTY.  |KHARIF DUTY|\r\n  +---------------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n  |                     |   Acres     |  Acres    |\r\n  |                     |             |           |\r\n  |Upper India          |135 to 237[7]| 49 to 120 |\r\n  |(Punjab and          |             |           |\r\n  |United Provinces)    |             |           |\r\n  |                     |             |           |\r\n  |Lower Chenab Canal[8]|133 to 134   | 47 to  88 |\r\n  |(Punjab)             |             |           |\r\n  |                     |             |           |\r\n  |Bengal               | 56 to 130   | 57 to 113 |\r\n  |                     |             |           |\r\n  |Bombay               | 85 to 118   | 58 to 159 |\r\n  +---------------------+-------------+-----------+\r\n\r\n  [7] Occasionally as low as 98 or even 62.\r\n\r\n  [8] The most recent canal.\r\n\r\nThe period of flow in each case would be six months or less.\r\n\r\nThe average rabi duties on the Lower Chenab and Upper Bari Doab Canals,\r\nin the Punjab, calculated on the discharges at the distributary heads,\r\nfor periods of 3 and 5 years respectively, ending March, 1904, were 208\r\nand 263 acres respectively, but in the latter case 11 per cent. of the\r\narea received only “first waterings.” For the kharif the figures are 100\r\nand 98 respectively.\r\n\r\nIn Italy the duty is 55 to 70 acres, in Spain from 45 to 205 acres, in\r\nthe Western States of America generally 60 to 150 acres. In South\r\nCalifornia the duty is 150 to 300 acres, when, as is usual, surface\r\nirrigation is employed, but 300 to 500 acres with subsoil irrigation,\r\nthe water being delivered in a pipe below ground level (CHAPTER V.)\r\n\r\nIn basin irrigation in Egypt the duty is 20 to 25 acres, but the period\r\nof flow is only 40 days. The basins are flooded to about 3 feet in\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Sketch of a Project.=--The tract of country to be dealt with in an\r\nirrigation project may be limited either by the natural features of the\r\ncountry, by its levels, by the quantity of water available or by\r\nfinancial considerations. If the tract is small or narrow, and\r\nparticularly if it is not very flat, it may be obvious that there is\r\nonly one line on which the irrigation channel can conveniently be\r\nconstructed but in any considerable scheme a contour plan of the whole\r\ntract is absolutely necessary. The surveys for such a plan are expensive\r\nand take time and it is desirable, as far as possible, to settle\r\nbeforehand the area over which they are to extend. This may be done to\r\nsome extent by the examination of any existing levels and of the tract\r\nitself. Very high, sandy or swampy ground, whether occurring at the edge\r\nof the tract or in the middle of it, may have to be left out. The\r\nremainder, as already mentioned, is called the commanded area. When land\r\noccupied by houses or roads or which is very much broken, or which for\r\nany reason cannot be irrigated, has also been deducted, the balance is\r\nthe “culturable commanded area.”\r\n\r\nEither before or after the culturable commanded area has been\r\napproximately ascertained, the proportion of it which is to be irrigated\r\nmust be settled. This depends on local circumstances. In India the\r\nsupply of water is calculated on the supposition that a fraction,\r\ngenerally from ¹⁄₃ to ³⁄₄, of the culturable commanded area will be\r\nirrigated each year. The rest will be lying fallow or be temporarily out\r\nof use or be used for crops which do not require canal irrigation. The\r\nrestriction of the area is necessary either because the supply of water\r\nis limited or in the interests of the people. Too liberal a supply of\r\nwater tends, as already stated, to over cultivation, and exhaustion and\r\nwater-logging of the soil.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to estimate the duty and the discharge of the canal and\r\nthen to fix its main dimensions. In Northern India the duty in the rabi\r\nis higher than in the kharif. It may be 200 acres in the rabi and 100\r\nacres in the kharif. Local circumstances determine which crop has the\r\ngreater area. Suppose that it is estimated that both will be equal. Then\r\nthe total annual area for which water is to be provided must be divided\r\nby two and this gives the kharif area. During the kharif there is\r\nusually an ample supply of water and the kharif mean supply of the canal\r\nis based on the kharif area and the kharif duty. The full supply is not\r\nrun all through the crop because the demand fluctuates, the demand being\r\ngreatest when all the crops have been sown and when there is no rain,\r\nbut from experience of other canals the ratio of the kharif full supply\r\nto the kharif mean supply can be estimated. The ratio is generally about\r\n1·25. On the kharif full supply depends the size of the channel, every\r\nchannel being constructed so as to carry a certain “full supply” or\r\nmaximum discharge and the top of the bank being made at such a height\r\nthat there shall be a sufficient margin or “free-board” above the “full\r\nsupply level.” The canal runs full provided that there is a sufficient\r\nsupply in the river or that the water level of the river is high\r\nenough--this last condition referring to canals which have no weir in\r\nthe river--and provided also that there is a sufficient “demand” for the\r\nwater. At other times a canal runs with less than full supply. This\r\ngenerally occurs throughout most of the rabi, the supply of water in the\r\nriver being then restricted. The distributaries are generally run full\r\nor ³⁄₄ths full, some being closed, in turn, to give water to the others.\r\nIn the case of a country where there is only one crop in the year, the\r\naverage discharge of the canal can be found by dividing the area by the\r\nestimated duty. The F.S. discharge can be assumed to bear such a\r\nrelation to the average discharge as may be found by experience to be\r\nsuitable. On some Indian inundation canals the F.S. discharge is taken\r\nas twice the average discharge.\r\n\r\nThe F.S. discharge of the canal having been arrived at, the alignments\r\nof the canal and branches are next sketched out on the contour plan and\r\ncertain tracts and discharges are assigned to each branch. The gradients\r\ncan be ascertained from the levels of the country and the cross-section\r\nof the channel can then be sketched out. If the velocity is too great\r\nfor the soil “falls” can be introduced. The above procedure will enable\r\na rough idea to be formed of the cost of the earthwork of the scheme.\r\nThe cost of the headworks and masonry works and distributaries can be\r\nbest estimated by obtaining actual figures for existing works of similar\r\ncharacter, the distributaries being reckoned at so much per mile. The\r\nprobable revenue which the canal will bring in will depend upon the rate\r\ncharged for the water and the cost and maintenance, matters which can\r\nonly be determined by local considerations based on the figures for\r\nexisting canals.\r\n\r\nThe masonry works on a canal consist of the headworks and of bridges,\r\nregulators and drainage crossings. The principles of design for such\r\nworks have been dealt with in _River and Canal Engineering_. It is of\r\ncourse economical to make a bridge and fall in one. If the off-take of a\r\ndistributary is anywhere in the neighbourhood the fall should of course\r\nbe downstream of it. The positions of the falls should be fixed in\r\naccordance with these considerations. If the longitudinal section is\r\nsuch that the position of the fall cannot be much altered, it may be\r\nfeasible to divert a road so that the bridge may be at the best site for\r\nthe fall. In the case of a railway crossing, a skew bridge is often\r\nnecessary. In the case of a road crossing it may be feasible to\r\nintroduce curves in the road but here also a skew bridge is often\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE DESIGNING OF A CANAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Headworks.=--In the design of head works no very precise rules can\r\nbe laid down. Some general ideas can however be given as to the chief\r\npoints to be attended to and some general and approximate rules stated.\r\nIn every case a large scale plan of the river is of course required and\r\nalso a close examination of it and study of its character. An attempt to\r\nforecast its action is then possible. Gauge readings for several years\r\nand calculations of discharges are of course necessary. If the bed of\r\nthe river, in course of time, rises upstream of the weir or scours\r\ndownstream of it, a large amount of protection to the bed and banks will\r\nbecome necessary. Some description of headworks and weirs, with a plan\r\nof the headworks of the Sirhind Canal, India, has been given in _River\r\nand Canal Engineering_, CHAPTERS IV. and X. Remarks regarding the\r\ncollection of information for such works are given in CHAPTER II. of the\r\nsame work. It is also explained how, by keeping the gates of the\r\nunder-sluices closed, a “pond” is formed between the divide wall and the\r\ncanal head so that heavy sand deposits in the pond and does not enter\r\nthe canal. By closing the canal and opening the under-sluices the\r\ndeposit is scoured away.\r\n\r\nThe best site for the headworks of a canal depends on the stability and\r\ngeneral character of the bed of the river but in deciding between any\r\ntwo proposed sites, the question of the additional cost of the canal, if\r\nthe upper site is adopted, has to be taken into account. Such cost may,\r\nin rugged country, be considerable.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Indian perennial canals, the head is often close to the\r\nhills where the river bed is of boulders and shingle and fairly stable,\r\nbut it is often at a distance from the hills and in such cases a gradual\r\nrise in the bed of the river, even in the absence of a weir, is more\r\nprobable than scour. Such a rise may necessitate a raising of the crest\r\nof the weir and of the bed of the canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nIn the general arrangement of a headworks a great deal depends on local\r\nconditions. Sometimes the river runs in a fairly straight and defined\r\nchannel and the weir can then be run straight across it. Sometimes, as\r\nin the case of the Ganges Canal, there is a succession of islands and\r\nvarious short weirs are required in the different channels. At the heads\r\nof the Eastern and Western Jumna Canals, the river, on issuing from the\r\nhills, widens out (Fig. 5.) and the weir is built obliquely and not in\r\na straight line. Its crest is higher at the east than at the west side.\r\nThere are under-sluices at both sides. The upstream end and west side of\r\nthe island are revetted. The old head of the Western Jumna Canal, as\r\nshown in the figure, existed long before the advent of the British, and\r\na temporary weir, made of gabions filled with stones, was constructed\r\nacross the river every year during the low water period and swept away\r\nduring the floods. To have carried the weir along the line shown dotted,\r\nthe head of the Western Jumna Canal being of course brought up to it,\r\nwould apparently have been feasible and cheaper, but the off-take would\r\nhave been in shallow water because of the curve in the river, and there\r\nwould have been no current along the face of the head regulator of the\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nThe level of the floor of the under-sluices is generally about the same\r\nas that of the bed of the canal. The sill--made to exclude shingle and\r\nsand as far as possible--of the canal head regulator may be 3 feet\r\nhigher and the crest of the weir 6 to 9 feet higher. The top of the weir\r\nshutters is 1 to 2·5 feet above the F.S. level of the canal which may be\r\n5 feet or more above the bed of the canal. If the weir is provided with\r\nfalling shutters the width of the waterway of the under-sluices may be\r\nabout ¹⁄₁₂th of the width of the waterway of the weir alone, otherwise\r\nabout ¹⁄₈th.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all cases the weir has a flat top and flat slopes both\r\nupstream and downstream. In a case where the river bed is of sand, the\r\ndepth of water on the crest of the weir in floods may be 15 feet and the\r\nvelocity 14 or 15 feet per second. The downstream slope of the weir may\r\nbe about 1 in 15, and the upstream slope 1 in 6. Where the river bed is\r\nof boulders the velocity may be still higher. The faces of the weir are\r\nusually of hammer-dressed stone. A lock for the passage of rafts is\r\nadded if necessary.\r\n\r\nUnless the banks of the river are high, it is necessary to construct\r\nembankments to prevent the river water, when headed up by the weir\r\nduring the floods, from spilling over the country with possible damage\r\nto the canal. If the river has side channels they have to be closed. The\r\nstream may also have to be trained, by means of guide banks or spurs, so\r\nas to remain in one channel and flow past the canal head and not form\r\nshoals against it. Where the river is unstable, it may shift its course\r\nso as to strike the weir obliquely and this may cause excessive heading\r\nup at one side of the weir. In such cases it is usual to divide the weir\r\ninto bays or sections, each about 500 feet long, by “divide walls”\r\nrunning at right angles to the weir.\r\n\r\nThe free-board or height of the masonry walls and tops of embankments\r\nabove H.F. Level is about 5 feet.\r\n\r\nThe span of each opening in the under-sluices is generally 20 to 35\r\nfeet. The piers may be 5 feet thick. It is usual to make each alternate\r\npier project upstream further than the others so that long logs coming\r\ndown the river during floods, broadside on, may be swung round and not\r\nbe caught and held against the piers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6A.]\r\n\r\nFigs. 6 and 6A show the headworks of the Upper Chenab Canal now under\r\nconstruction (CHAPTER IV.) The site is in a low flat plain, but no\r\nbetter site could be found. The weir consists of 8 bays of 500 feet\r\neach. The crest is 10 feet above the river bed and the falling shutters\r\n6 feet high. The slopes are 1 in 6 and 1 in 15. The bulk of the work is\r\nrubble masonry in lime. The lower layer upstream of the crest is of\r\npuddle; upstream of the second line of wells it is rubble masonry in\r\nhalf sand and half lime; upstream of the lower line of wells it is of\r\ndry stone and there is an intermediate layer of rubble masonry in lime\r\nwith the stones laid flat. Below the crest there is a wall of masonry 9\r\nfeet thick and on the crest there are two strips of ashlar between which\r\nthe shutters lie when down. The extreme upstream and downstream portions\r\nof the bed protection are of dry stone and 4 feet thick while next to\r\nthe weir are concrete blocks 2 feet thick resting on dry stone. The\r\nwidth of the crest is 14 feet, of the weir 140 feet, of the protection\r\n70 feet upstream and 110 feet downstream. The guide banks have tops 40\r\nfeet wide and 18 and 14 feet above the crest of the weir in the upstream\r\nand downstream lengths respectively, the side slopes being 2 to 1 and\r\nthe water slope being covered, up to H.W. level, by dry stone pitching 4\r\nfeet thick. The left guide bank runs upstream for 3,250 feet from the\r\ncentre line of the canal and the right 2000 feet from the line of crest\r\nshutters. The under-sluices have 8 bays of 35 feet each and the canal\r\nhead regulator 36 openings of 6·5 feet each, the large openings shown in\r\nthe figure being sub-divided. The crest of the weir is no less than 10\r\nfeet above the river bed and the shutters add 6 feet to this. The floor\r\nof the under-sluices is 4 feet higher than the river bed. There is thus\r\nample allowance for a possible rise in the river bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =The Contour Map.=--The contour map, besides showing the contours of\r\nthe country to be irrigated and of a strip of country, even if not to be\r\nirrigated, which will be traversed by the main line, should show all its\r\nmain features, namely:--streams, drainages, railways, roads,\r\nembankments, reservoirs, towns, villages, habitations, and the\r\nboundaries of woods and cultivated lands. It should also show the\r\nhighest water levels in all streams or existing canals. A map showing as\r\nmany as possible of the above features should be obtained and lines of\r\nlevels run for the contours. In doing this, the points where the lines\r\nof levels cut or pass near to any of the above features or boundary\r\nlines, should be noted. It may be necessary to correct inaccuracies in\r\nthe plan or to supply defects in it. The greater the trouble taken to do\r\nthis the less will be the trouble experienced later on.\r\n\r\nThe heights of the contour lines will, in very flat country, have\r\neventually to be only 1 foot apart. This will necessitate running lines\r\nof levels half-a-mile apart at the most, and preferably 2000 feet apart,\r\nthe pegs in each line being about 500 feet apart. In less flat country\r\nthe heights of the contour lines can be further apart than 1 foot.\r\nWhatever distance apart is decided on for them, the survey should be\r\ndone once for all. On one of the Indian canals in flat country, the\r\nlines of levels were at first taken 5 miles apart, the branches roughly\r\naligned and then further surveys made. This led to great expense and\r\ndelay and the procedure has not been repeated.\r\n\r\nIn making a contour survey, a base line, as centrally situated and as\r\nlong as possible, should be laid down, with side lines parallel to it\r\nnear the boundaries of the tract. The cross lines at half-mile or other\r\nintervals should then be laid down. Some of them may run out beyond the\r\nside lines. Circuits of levels should be run along the base line, the\r\nside lines and the two extreme cross lines and be carefully checked. The\r\nremaining cross lines should then be levelled. All the levels having\r\nbeen shown on the map the contours should be sketched in. The scale of\r\nthe map for a large project may be two inches to a mile. If it is likely\r\nthat the survey will have to be extended, it will be easier to do this\r\nby prolonging the base line and running more cross lines, than by\r\nprolonging each of the cross lines already surveyed. This can be borne\r\nin mind when selecting the base line.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Alignments and Discharges.=--On the contour map the proposed\r\nalignments of the canal, branches, distributaries, and escapes,\r\ndetermined after careful consideration of all matters affecting them,\r\nare shown. The tracts to be irrigated by each branch and each\r\ndistributary are now marked off, the “irrigation boundaries” following\r\napproximately the valleys and lines of drainage. Any large tracts of\r\nland which cannot be irrigated are of course shown and are excluded.\r\nForests or other lands which are not to be irrigated should be similarly\r\ndealt with, otherwise confusion is likely to arise later. The commanded\r\narea dependent on each distributary is now ascertained from the map. A\r\ncertain percentage being deducted for scattered unculturable areas the\r\nculturable commanded areas are obtained. The proportion to be irrigated\r\n(in India in the kharif) having previously been decided, the number of\r\nacres to be actually irrigated by each distributary is arrived at.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to ascertain the discharges.[9] A general duty for the\r\nwhole canal having been estimated by considering the actual figures for\r\nother canals the full supply of the canal at its head is arrived at.\r\n(CHAPTER I, Art. 6). In Northern India it will be the kharif duty and\r\nkharif full supply. Since some water is lost by absorption in the\r\nchannels, the duty of the water on a branch is higher than that of the\r\nwhole canal based on its head discharge, and the duty on a distributary\r\nis higher still. In designing a canal, an attempt has to be made to\r\nestimate the losses of water in the main canal and branches, so that the\r\nduties of the branches and distributaries may be estimated and the\r\nchannels designed accordingly. On the Western Jumna Canal the figures\r\nwere estimated to be as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                           Kharif. Rabi.\r\n  Average discharge at canal head (c. ft. per sec.)         3536   2755\r\n  Duty based on the discharge (acres)                         98    138\r\n  Estimated loss of water in canal and branches (c. ft. per\r\n  sec.)                                                      400    300\r\n  Average discharge at distributary head (c. ft. per sec.)  3136   2455\r\n  Duty based on the discharge (acres)                        111    154\r\n\r\n  [9] In this Article and in the rest of this Chapter it is assumed that\r\n  the canal is a Northern Indian one. Any modifications necessary to\r\n  suit canals in other countries will readily suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nThe question of duty is one which if not carefully considered, may cause\r\nsome confusion. A canal and branches, having been designed with certain\r\nassumed duties and with discharges based on certain values of N in\r\nKutter’s co-efficient, have, let it be supposed, been constructed to a\r\ngreater or less extent. When the time comes for constructing the\r\ndistributaries, the engineers concerned may have different ideas, based\r\non later experience, as regards the probable duty and the most suitable\r\nvalue of N. If they design the distributaries with a higher duty and a\r\nlower value of N, it is obvious that they can provide more\r\ndistributaries than at first designed, or can increase their lengths. In\r\neither case they would provide for an increased commanded area. If they\r\ndo not do this, they ought to adhere to the values at first proposed,\r\nthus making the channels larger than, according to their ideas, would be\r\nnecessary. These larger channels will be able to do more irrigation, by\r\nan increase, not in the commanded area, but in the proportion of it\r\nwhich is irrigated. Any other course would result in the canal carrying\r\nmore water than could presumably be used by the distributaries. Again,\r\nthe question how the assumed duty was arrived at may need consideration.\r\nIt may have been arrived at by taking the duty figures of some existing\r\ncanal, based on discharge figures which were the result, not of observed\r\nbut of calculated discharges, and if the calculations were based on a\r\nvalue of N which experience has proved to be wrong, a correction is\r\nobviously needed. Many mistakes of the kinds indicated above have been\r\nmade, not perhaps in the case of a project which has been recently got\r\nup and is then quickly carried out in its entirety, but in one which is\r\ncarried out slowly or after a long period has elapsed or in one which\r\nconsists of extensions of an existing system. So great, however, is the\r\nelasticity of a channel--by which is meant its capacity for adapting\r\nitself to varied discharges, a small change in the depth of water\r\ncausing a great change in the discharge--and so considerable has been\r\nthe uncertainty as to the real duty to be expected, that any mistakes\r\nmade have not usually resulted in any serious trouble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIFURCATION AT TAIL OF CANAL.\r\n\r\nThe Distributaries have Gates and Winches.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 41._]\r\n\r\nIt has been stated (CHAPTER I, Art. 2) that it is not desirable to let\r\none channel tail into another. In old canals a distributary used\r\nsometimes, after running parallel to a canal, to be brought back towards\r\nit and tail into it. The advantage of this was that the distributary had\r\nnot to be made very small towards the tail and that, if the demand\r\nabruptly ceased, the distributary was not likely to breach. The\r\nprinciple was, however, essentially bad. The lower part of the\r\ndistributary was obviously too near the canal and not centrally\r\nsituated as regards the irrigated strip. The portion at the extreme tail\r\nwas superfluous. Again, whatever volume of water was carried through the\r\ndistributary and back into the canal, was needlessly detached instead of\r\nbeing kept in bulk. Moreover the duty of water on such a distributary\r\ncannot be ascertained without a tail gauge and the observation of\r\ndischarges at the tail. There are similar objections to one distributary\r\ntailing into another. Each should be separate and distinct.\r\n\r\nA major distributary is one whose discharge is more than 40 c. ft. per\r\nsecond. It may be as much as 250 c. ft. per second. A branch, as soon as\r\nit reaches a point where its discharge becomes only 250 c. ft. per\r\nsecond should be considered as a major distributary. A minor\r\ndistributary is one whose discharge is from 8 to 40 c. ft. per second. A\r\nminor distributary is nearly always a branch of a major distributary.\r\nThere are instances of “direct minors,” i.e., minors taking off from\r\ncanals or branches. Such a minor, unless its discharge is a large\r\nfraction of that of the canal which supplies it--and this can seldom be\r\nthe case--is objectionable because the petty native official who has to\r\nsee to the regulation of supplies can manipulate the supply easily and\r\nwithout detection, and the number of persons irrigating from it being\r\nsmall, he can make private arrangements with them. On the Sidhnai Canal\r\nthere are some half-dozen distributaries each of which had one or two\r\nminors which took off close to the head of the distributary. The people\r\nwho irrigated from the minors managed to get the heads shifted and taken\r\noff direct from the canal, on the ground that, the water level in the\r\ncanal being higher than in the distributary, there would be better\r\ncommand and less silt deposit. The irrigation on all these minors ran up\r\nto a figure far in excess of what had been intended, to the detriment of\r\nlands further down the canal. The minor heads have all been\r\nretransferred to the distributaries, the difficulty as to command being\r\ngot over, as it should have been at first, by constructing weirs in the\r\ndistributaries. The fall in the water surface at the distributary head,\r\ni.e., the difference between the water level in the canal and that in\r\nthe distributary downstream of its head but upstream of the weir, is\r\nquite trifling or even inappreciable.\r\n\r\nIn some of the older Indian canals it was the custom to place the heads\r\nof distributaries, not just above a fall but several hundred feet above\r\nit, the idea being that the distributary then received less silt. This\r\npractice has now been discontinued. There is no valid reason for\r\nfollowing it.\r\n\r\nThe question whether, when a channel crosses a road on the skew, a skew\r\nbridge should be constructed or curves introduced into the road or\r\nchannel, is one which requires some consideration. As far as possible\r\nthe lines of channels should be fixed so as to cross important[10] roads\r\non the square or with a small angle of skew. In the case of main canals\r\nor branches, the introduction of special curves is generally out of the\r\nquestion, but if the road is not straight something can be done by\r\nshifting the line one way or the other. In the case of “major”\r\ndistributaries, curves can to some extent be introduced. In the case of\r\n“minor” distributaries it is often possible to curve the channel, with a\r\nradius of say 500 feet, so that it will cross the road at right angles.\r\nThere is very little objection to a skew bridge if the angle of skew is\r\nnot great. The angle of crossing having been made as near to 90° as\r\npossible, the bridge can be made skew though not necessarily so much\r\naskew as the road. Slight curves can be introduced into the road. When\r\nthe road is made askew, a bridge on the square involves at least three\r\nconsiderable curves (Fig. 7) and the taking up of extra land. It also\r\ncauses, in perpetuity most likely, a more or less inconvenient and\r\nunsightly arrangement and one which, in most countries, would not be\r\ntolerated. When the angle of skew is not great, it is best to introduce\r\nno curve at all into the road. In the case of a “village” road, which\r\nmay be more or less undefined and liable to be shifted, the difficulty\r\nabout land may not be great, but even in this case the angle of crossing\r\nshould, if possible, be kept near to 90°, especially in the case of\r\nminors, and where curves have to be introduced into the road they should\r\nbe suitable ones. Abrupt angles are not only unsightly but are unfair to\r\nthe cart drivers. The crossings of village roads by the minors of a\r\ncertain great modern canal have been stigmatised as “hideous.” Indian\r\ncanals can afford to do work properly.\r\n\r\n  [10] In India “district” and “provincial” roads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Remarks on Distributaries.=--Before a canal system can be properly\r\ndesigned, it is necessary to determine certain points in connection with\r\nthe working of the distributaries. A distributary is intended to\r\nirrigate a certain kharif area. Its average kharif supply is determined\r\nfrom the assumed kharif duty. It generally runs full in the kharif but\r\nnot always. In a very dry tract such as the Montgomery district of the\r\nPunjab, the demand is so great and so steady that a distributary\r\npractically runs full through the greater part of the kharif. In such a\r\ncase the canal or branch must be so designed that it can keep all\r\ndistributaries full at the same time. Its F.S. discharge will be the sum\r\nof all the F.S. discharges of the distributaries plus the losses of\r\nwater by absorption.\r\n\r\nBut in other cases, especially if the rainfall is considerable, a\r\ndistributary does not require its full supply, either all through the\r\nkharif or for long at a time. An estimate must then be made of what it\r\nwill require. It may be estimated that its requirements will be met if,\r\nduring the period of greatest demand, it is closed for two days out of a\r\nfortnight and receives full supply for the remaining twelve days. In\r\nthis case, since the various distributaries need not all be closed on\r\nthe same days, the canal or branch can be so designed that it will carry\r\na full supply equal (after deducting losses) to ⁶⁄₇ths of the aggregate\r\nfull supplies of the distributaries. In other cases the fraction may be\r\n³⁄₄ths. It is likely to be lower the greater the rainfall of the\r\ndistrict. Even in the case when the distributaries run full through\r\nnearly the whole of the kharif, there will be periods when they only run\r\nwith about ³⁄₄ths full supply. If full supply were run at such times,\r\nmany of the outlets would discharge more water than was required, the\r\ncultivators would partly close them, and breaches in the banks of the\r\ndistributary might result. Thus the water level of a distributary must\r\nalways be so arranged that it will have a good “command” when it is\r\nrunning with about three-fourths of the full supply discharge. The water\r\nlevel with ³⁄₄ths full supply is generally ·5 to ·75 feet below the full\r\nsupply level but it should be calculated in each case. Generally it will\r\nbe correct to make the water level, when ³⁄₄ full supply is run, about 1\r\nfoot above the high ground traversed by the distributary, excluding any\r\nexceptionally high portions of small area. A more exact method is given\r\nin Art. 9. The greater the proportion of the culturable area which is to\r\nbe irrigated, the less should be the area of any high land which is\r\nexcluded. The F.S. levels of the distributaries at their off-takes must\r\nbe settled in accordance with the foregoing remarks, and these F.S.\r\nlevels must be entered on the plan. Neglect to thus fix the F.S. levels\r\nof distributaries before designing the canals has frequently led to\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe head needed at a bifurcation in order to get the supply into a\r\nbranch or distributary is always small unless the velocity is high. For\r\na velocity of 3 feet per second the head required is only about ·16 ft.,\r\nfor 2 ft. per second ·1 ft.\r\n\r\nOn an Inundation Canal which has no weir across the river, the mean\r\nsupply downstream of the regulator (which is built a few miles down the\r\ncanal lest it should be damaged by the shifting of the river) is, as has\r\nbeen mentioned, about half the full supply. The command in such canals\r\nis not generally very good. A distributary can often obtain only mean\r\nsupply and it should be designed so as to command the country when it is\r\ncarrying mean supply. A detailed description of Inundation Canals in\r\nNorthern India, is given in _Punjab Rivers and Works_.\r\n\r\nLet M, F, m, f, be the mean and full supply discharges at the heads of a\r\ncanal and of an average distributary on it and let the number of\r\ndistributaries be n. It has been seen (Chap. I. Art. 6.) that M = ·8F\r\nabout. Let k be the proportion of the supply lost by absorption in canal\r\nand branches. Then n m = (1 - k) M = ·8 (1 - k) F. If the distributaries\r\nall run with full supplies--at the time of greatest demand--for 4 days\r\nout of 5, then,\r\n\r\n  nf = 1·25 (1 - k)F\r\n\r\n  f   1·25\r\n  - = ---- = 1·56\r\n  m    ·8\r\n\r\nSince k depends on the wetted area, it is not likely to be so great for\r\nF as for M, but the above gives a general idea of the ratio of the full\r\nkharif discharge to the mean kharif discharge. On a large canal the\r\ncircumstances of the distributaries will not all be similar. Some will\r\nrun full for a greater proportion of their time than others. They can be\r\ndivided into groups and the ratio of the full to the mean supply\r\ncalculated for each group. The mean supply is, as above stated, obtained\r\nfrom the area to be irrigated, and the duty as estimated at the\r\ndistributary head.\r\n\r\nAt one time a system was introduced of making distributaries of large\r\nsize with the idea of running them for short periods. One reason given\r\nfor abandoning this arrangement, was that there was a tendency to run\r\nsuch a distributary for too long. This reason is not very intelligible.\r\nIt would be applicable to any distributary which was not intended to be\r\nrun without cessation. The result would be that some other distributary\r\nwould be kept short of water and this would imply extremely bad\r\nmanagement. The chief reason against such a distributary is the greater\r\ncost of its construction. It would effect a saving of water. The ratio\r\nof the discharge to the wetted area would be high, though this would be\r\nto some extent neutralized by the greater frequency of closures, since,\r\nwhen water is admitted to a dry channel, the absorption is at first\r\ngreat. There would also be some difficulty in the distribution of the\r\nwater because of the short period for which it would remain open. It\r\nwill be seen (Chapter III. Art. 5), that it is desirable to open and\r\nclose always at the same hour of the day. An ordinary distributary might\r\nrun for 11 days out of 14. One of double the size could not conveniently\r\nbe run for 5¹⁄₂ days. A distributary can always be enlarged if\r\nnecessary, but if made too large it is extremely difficult to make it\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nIt was also, at one time, usual to make minors, when there were several\r\non a distributary, of large capacities so that they ran in turns. The\r\npreceding remarks apply to this case. The system has been abandoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Design of Canal and Branches.=--The apportioning of discharges to\r\nthe various channels having been effected as described in Art. 2, the\r\ndesigning of the canal and branches is proceeded with. Rough\r\nlongitudinal sections of all the lines are prepared by means of the\r\ncontour map, the ground levels being shown at intervals of one foot--or\r\nwhatever the vertical distance between the contours may be--and the\r\nhorizontal distances obtained from the map by scaling.\r\n\r\nOn these longitudinal sections the lines proposed for the bed and F.S.\r\nlevels are shown reach by reach and also the mean velocities and\r\ndischarges.\r\n\r\nThe laws of silting and scouring and the principles on which channels\r\nshould be designed are fully gone into in _River and Canal Engineering_.\r\nIt is there explained that, for a channel of depth D, there is a certain\r\ncritical velocity, V₀, which just prevents the deposit of the silt,\r\nconsisting of heavy clay and fine sand, found in Indian rivers--this\r\nsilt enters the canal in such immense quantities that the canal silt\r\nclearances would be impossible if much of it was deposited in the\r\nchannels--that sand of grades heavier than [·1] may deposit in the head\r\nof a canal and well nigh threaten its existence, that the clear water\r\nentering the canal in winter may pick up and carry on some of the sand\r\nbut that proper steps for preventing the deposit in the canal can be\r\ntaken at the headworks. This last question has been referred to in Art.\r\n1. The following additional rules for designing canals in Northern India\r\nare chiefly taken from those given by Kennedy in the explanatory notes\r\nto his Hydraulic Diagrams, which are in use in the Irrigation Branch in\r\nNorthern India.\r\n\r\n  (1) Near the hills where the bed is of shingle the velocity may exceed\r\n  V₀. A few other soils will stand 1·1 V₀.\r\n\r\n  (2) In ordinary channels any excess over V₀ will give much trouble\r\n  lower down.\r\n\r\n  (3) In the first four or five miles of a distributary, V₀ should be\r\n  allowed and gradually be reduced to ·85 V₀ at the tail, the gradient\r\n  being reduced if convenient, while a minor or branch distributary\r\n  should have less than V₀ at its off-take and still less at the tail.\r\n  The sand is drawn off by the outlets and in the lower part of a\r\n  distributary it is often non-existent.\r\n\r\n  (4) If there is efficient silt trapping at the head of the canal any\r\n  figures arrived at by the preceding rules should be multiplied by ·9.\r\n\r\n  (5) In the case of a canal having its head far from the hills, the\r\n  sand is finer and any figures arrived at as above may be multiplied\r\n  by, perhaps, about ·75, but further experience is needed to decide\r\n  this.\r\n\r\n  (6) If the soil is very poor, especially if the depth of water is more\r\n  than 6 or 7 feet, the velocity should be less than V₀--say ·9 V₀--so\r\n  as not to cause falling in of the banks. Depths of more than 9 or 9·5\r\n  feet should, as far as possible, be avoided for the same reason.\r\n\r\n  (7) At a bifurcation, one branch channel may have no raised sill, and,\r\n  owing to its smaller depth, it may draw off no surface water and get\r\n  an undue share of rolling sand. Its velocity should be greater than V₀\r\n  and that of the other branch be less than V₀.\r\n\r\n  (8) At such a bifurcation it may be necessary, during times of low\r\n  supply, to head up the water in the main channel and some silt may\r\n  temporarily be deposited in it. When the heading up ceases, the silt\r\n  is scoured away but it mostly goes into the branch whose bed level is\r\n  the lower. It is best to design such bifurcations so that the sill\r\n  levels of the two branches are equal and, if possible, so that their\r\n  bed levels are equal.[11] Otherwise the channel which is likely to get\r\n  most silt should have the steeper gradient.\r\n\r\n  (9) Any existing well established régime should not be tampered with.\r\n\r\n  [11] Appendix A in _River and Canal Engineering_ deals with some\r\n  instances of fallacies in questions concerning flow in open streams.\r\n  An extract from it describing a remarkable divide wall recently\r\n  constructed at the head of the Gagera branch, Lower Chenab Canal, is\r\n  given in Appendix A of this book.\r\n\r\nExperience shows that in designing Irrigation Channels in the plains of\r\nIndia in accordance with Kennedy’s figures, the maximum ratio of bed\r\nwidth to depth of water is as follows:--\r\n\r\n  Discharge, c. ft. per second   10    25    100    200    500    1,000\r\n  Ratio                         3·5     4    4·5     5      6       6\r\n\r\nThe actual gradients of the canals generally range from about 1 in 8,000\r\nfor a main canal to 1 in 2,000 for the tail of a distributary, but near\r\nthe head of a canal where the bed is of boulders and shingle, the\r\ngradient may be as steep as 1 in 1,000.[12] The velocity in this last\r\ncase may be 5 feet per second but generally it is not more than 3 or 4\r\nfeet per second in canals and branches, and 1 to 2 feet per second in\r\ndistributaries.\r\n\r\n  [12] On the Upper Jhelum Canal, 1 in 970.\r\n\r\nIn designing the channels, N, in Kutter’s co-efficient, may be taken as\r\n·0225 or ·020, according to judgment. For new and smooth channels ·020\r\nis generally correct. A channel generally becomes rougher by use but\r\nsometimes it becomes smoother. Cases have occurred in which N has been\r\nfound to be ·016. This question is discussed in _Hydraulics_, Chap. VI.\r\n\r\nThe bed width of a canal is reduced, where a distributary takes off, in\r\nsuch a way that when the canal and distributary are both running full,\r\nthe depth of water in the canal continues to be uniform and the flow to\r\nbe uniform. When the distributary is closed there is heading up in the\r\ncanal upstream of the off-take, but not enough to make any appreciable\r\ndifference unless the capacity of the distributary is a large fraction\r\nof that of the canal and even then no harm is likely to result.\r\n\r\nThe preceding rules and principles being taken into consideration, the\r\nchannels are designed. The bed levels, gradients and depths are so\r\narranged as to give the velocities suited to the soil and to maintain\r\nthe proper relation of depth to velocity. The bed width is arranged so\r\nas to give the proper discharge. The full supply level of the canal and\r\nbranches has also to be so arranged that it shall be higher, at each\r\ndistributary off-take, than the full supply level of the distributary.\r\nIt is desirable to be able to give a distributary its full supply even\r\nwhen the canal is low. Generally the slope of the country along any line\r\nis greater than would be suitable for the bed, and “falls” are\r\nintroduced. The off-take of a distributary is generally just above a\r\nfall and there is generally an ample margin between its F.S. level and\r\nthat of the canal. The discharge of the canal during the greater part of\r\nthe rabi may be only about half the full supply. This discharge should\r\nbe estimated and the water level corresponding to it calculated and\r\nshown on the longitudinal section. If possible the levels should be so\r\narranged that even with its least supply the water level in the canal\r\nwill enable full supply to be given to a distributary. If this cannot\r\notherwise be managed it may be necessary to construct a regulator in the\r\ncanal below the head of the distributary so that, during low supplies,\r\nthe water can be headed up. It has been stated in _River and Canal\r\nEngineering_, Chapter IV., that such heading up, if temporary, is not at\r\nall likely to cause silt deposit in the canal. The designing of the\r\ndistributaries is not proceeded with at this stage.\r\n\r\nSince no irrigation is usually done directly from the canal and\r\nbranches, they are designed without any particular connection between\r\nthe level of the water and that of the country traversed. Dangerously\r\nhigh embankments are of course avoided as far as possible. The bed is\r\ndesigned at such a level that the excavation and embankment at any place\r\nwill be, as nearly as possible, equal. Land in India is cheap. When the\r\nexcavation exceeds the embankment the balance is made into a spoil bank.\r\nWhen the excavation is less than the embankment the balance is got from\r\nborrow-pits.\r\n\r\nThe side slopes of channels in excavation are generally 1 to 1, in\r\nembankment 1¹⁄₂ to 1. The sides of channels of small or moderate size\r\nusually become about ¹⁄₂ to 1, or even vertical, by the deposit of silt\r\non the slopes. This reduction of area is allowed for in the design i.e.\r\nthe bed width is so designed that the channel will carry the required\r\ndischarge, not with the side slopes as executed, but when they have\r\nbecome ¹⁄₂ to 1. In large canals however the sides do not always silt up\r\nbut rather tend to fall in. When this is expected to occur the allowance\r\nabove described is not made. Berms are left so that if any part of the\r\nsides fall in, the bank will not also fall in. The berms also allow of\r\nthe channel being widened if that ever becomes necessary. Type sections\r\nare given in Figs. 8 and 9.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Banks and Roads.=--Figs. 8 and 9 show the banks and spoil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe scale is 6 feet to an inch. The depth of water, in this particular\r\ncase, is 7 feet, and the bank, excluding the small raised bank, 2 feet\r\nabove the water. The inside edge of the bank, where the small raised\r\nbank is shown, is kept parallel to the canal for a considerable\r\ndistance. Its position is got by drawing a line, shown dotted, at,\r\ngenerally, 1¹⁄₂ to 1. The embanked part of the slope is actually made at\r\n1¹⁄₂ to 1, but the excavation is at 1 to 1, so that a berm is left. The\r\nwidth of this berm of course varies as the depth of digging varies. If\r\nthere is likely to be much falling in of the sides the berm can be made\r\nwider, the dotted line starting, not from the edge of the bed, but from\r\na point further in. On an inundation canal in sandy soil the berm may be\r\n20 feet wide. In figure 8, the inside slope above the berm is supposed\r\nto have silted up to a slope of 1 to 1. In cases where it is expected\r\nthe whole inside slope will silt to ¹⁄₂ to 1 the dotted line, to give\r\nthe edge of the bank, can be shifted towards the channel so that the\r\nberm at the ground level when the channel is excavated will be very\r\nsmall for the minimum depth of digging. There is no need for the inner\r\nedge of the bank to run parallel to the canal for great distances. Its\r\nposition can be shifted whenever suitable and the width of the berm at\r\nground level varied. This prevents the occupation of a needlessly great\r\nwidth of land. It used at one time to be not unusual to make a bank with\r\na berm on the land side, similar to that formed by the spoil in Fig. 8,\r\nbut at about the level of full supply in the canal. The principle is not\r\na good one. Salient angles are liable to be worn away. If earth has to\r\nbe added to a bank to strengthen it, the whole can be widened or the\r\nrear slope flattened. The roadway is shown 18 feet wide, which is nearly\r\nthe maximum. For the drainage of rain water it has a transverse slope,\r\naway from the canal, of about 1 in 50. The small raised bank on the\r\ncanal side is to give safety to wheeled vehicles. It is provided on the\r\npatrol bank[13] on main lines and places where there is much traffic or\r\nwhere there is plenty of width of bank to spare. When the ground level\r\nis, for a considerable distance, above the proper bank level--which is\r\nat a fixed height above the F.S. Level--so that the road and its\r\nside-drain have to be cut out, much earthwork can be saved by allowing\r\nthem to be at a higher level and, in the case at least of the non-patrol\r\nroad, giving the road a reduced width.\r\n\r\n  [13] A canal has an unmetalled driving road--called the “patrol road”\r\n  or “inspection road” on one bank. This road is reserved for the use of\r\n  officials. Otherwise, it would soon be cut up and worn away, and the\r\n  cost of repairs would be excessive. The patrol road should be on that\r\n  bank which is, in the morning (the time when inspections are usually\r\n  made) in the shade of trees planted on the landward side. Trees are\r\n  not usually planted near the water edge as they are sometimes blown\r\n  down. In Northern India the canals generally flow in a southerly\r\n  direction, so that the left bank is best for the patrol bank. On the\r\n  other bank there is a bridle road which is open to the public. Near a\r\n  rest house--unless there is a bridge actually at the place--the patrol\r\n  road should be on the same bank as the rest house. It can if necessary\r\n  cross at the first bridge. Frequently there is also on one or both\r\n  sides of the canal a “boundary road,” which is open to the public,\r\n  along the toe of the outer slope. Along a distributary there may be a\r\n  boundary road on one side. It is generally the only road which can\r\n  take wheeled traffic, and in this case it should be reserved for\r\n  officials unless money is provided to keep it always in repair.\r\n  Officials have to be on tour for weeks or months at a time, and in all\r\n  weathers. Their baggage carts also have to precede and follow them.\r\n  Anything which facilitates their touring about and seeing things for\r\n  themselves is, in India, most desirable. At a watercourse crossing the\r\n  boundary road along a distributary should be taken by a curved incline\r\n  up on to the bank and down again. Thus not only is the cost of a\r\n  culvert saved, but any touring official who is driving obtains a view\r\n  of the channel which he cannot get from the boundary road.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nIn shallow digging, the plan of setting back the banks (Fig. 10) and\r\nletting silt deposit as shown by the dotted lines, is one which should\r\nbe followed much oftener than it is. It not only gives eventually a very\r\nstrong bank, but it enables the borrow pits, from which the earth for\r\nthe banks is got, to be dug inside the banks. Outside borrow pits,\r\nbesides being a source of expense, owing to compensation having to be\r\npaid to those in whose land they are dug, cause great areas of hollows\r\nwhich are not only unsightly, but are often full of stagnant water and\r\nare thus a fruitful source of mosquitoes and malaria. Insufficient\r\nattention has hitherto been paid to this matter.\r\n\r\nIn designing each reach of a canal or branch, type cross sections should\r\nbe drawn out for several different depths of digging, _e.g._, one for\r\nvery shallow digging, _i.e._, where the bed is little, if at all, above\r\nthe ground level, one for deep digging where the ground is higher than\r\nthe water level, and one for the “balancing depth,” where the area of\r\nthe channel excavation is equal to the earth required for the banks. In\r\ncalculating the earthwork the sectional area of the digging or of the\r\nembankment is taken, whichever is the greater.\r\n\r\nThe proper width and height of bank for any channel depends partly on\r\nthe maximum depth of water in the channel, and partly on the discharge.\r\nGiven a depth of water of say 8 feet, a breach will obviously be more\r\ndisastrous with a great volume of water than with a small volume. The\r\nfollowing statement gives some figures suitable to the rather light and\r\nfriable soils of Northern India, but the question is largely one of\r\njudgment. Generally a low and rather wide bank is preferable to a higher\r\nand narrower one. If a road, with or without the small raised bank next\r\nthe canal, is required, special widths can, of course, be arranged for.\r\nA 14-foot bank is required for a driving road.\r\n\r\n  ------------+--------------+---------------+---------------\r\n  Top Width of|Height of Bank|   Greatest    |   Greatest\r\n     Bank.    | above F.

The width of\r\nthe spoil may vary every chain. In Fig. 9 the spoil is raised to avoid\r\ntaking up too much land. The spoil presents the best appearance when its\r\nheight is kept uniform for as long a length as possible, the width\r\nvarying according to necessity, When the height has to be altered, the\r\nchange should be made by means of a short ramp. When the spoil is higher\r\nthan the road, gaps in it are left at intervals so that rain water can\r\npass away. When the spoil is heavy for a very short length it can, in\r\norder to avoid a short and unsightly heap, which would result from the\r\nadoption of the section shown in Fig. 9, be placed as in Fig. 8, some of\r\nit being led askew.\r\n\r\nThe small channel shown outside the bank in Fig. 8 is a watercourse for\r\nenabling trees to be grown. It has, of course, to be graded, and it may\r\nbe in cutting or in embankment. If any silt clearances of the canal are\r\nlikely to be necessary, the watercourse must be set back to allow room\r\nfor the spoil. Such spoil, if sandy, is to a large extent washed down or\r\nblown away and does not accumulate to anything like the extent that\r\nwould be expected.[14] Moreover the spoil can extend onto the\r\nwatercourse when the trees have grown big, and no longer need watering.\r\nOutside the watercourse is shown the boundary road and the land boundary\r\npillar. The small channel in Fig. 9 is a drain for rain water. It can be\r\nused as a plantation watercourse if the water is lifted.\r\n\r\n  [14] This fact has been quoted (_The Pioneer Mail_, “Silt,” 8th March,\r\n  1913) as showing that the silt supposed to be cleared is not really\r\n  cleared. This may be the case to some extent, but shortage of spoil is\r\n  little proof of it.\r\n\r\nWhere there is no spoil, some extra land, perhaps 20 feet on either\r\nbank, is usually taken up for getting earth from for repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. =Trial Lines.=--The proposed lines of channel, determined as\r\nexplained in Art. 5 should next be laid down on the ground. A line\r\nshould consist of a number of straight portions. The curves should not\r\nbe put in. Trial pits should be dug at intervals. Some defects in the\r\nline may at once become apparent because the contour map, owing chiefly\r\nto the lines of levels having been taken a considerable distance apart,\r\nis not perfect. A line may pass through a patch of very high or very low\r\nground or too near to some building or other object with which it is\r\ndesirable not to interfere. Alteration may be desirable at a drainage\r\ncrossing or at the off-take of a branch. The lines should be corrected\r\nwhere necessary. Sometimes the corrections may be very considerable.\r\nAllowance can be made for the alterations which will occur when the\r\ncurves are laid out. Where there is doubt as to which line is the best,\r\ntrial pits may be dug to obtain further information regarding the soil.\r\n\r\nThe line should now be levelled, careful checks being made, a\r\nlongitudinal section of it prepared and the proposed bed, bank and F.S.\r\nlevel shown. The ground levels ascertained by levelling the line, are\r\ncertain to disagree, to some extent, with the contour lines. The latter\r\nwere got only by inference from the levels of points in the survey\r\nlines, and they should be corrected in accordance with the fresh levels\r\nnow available. If the line does not seem to be the best that can be got,\r\na fresh line can be marked on the plan and the above procedure repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. =Final Line and Estimate.=--As soon as the best line seems to have\r\nbeen found, a large scale plan of the country along its course should be\r\nmade by taking bearings or off-sets from points in it to the various\r\nobjects and noting where the line cuts them. On this plan will be shown\r\nthe exact alignment, the curves being put in and the straight portions\r\nslightly shifted where necessary so that the line may pass at a proper\r\ndistance from any buildings or other objects. But before this procedure\r\nis carried out, or while it is being carried out, the estimate for the\r\nwork can be prepared from the longitudinal section already taken. Such a\r\nsection is of course amply sufficient for a “project estimate,” in which\r\nonly approximate figures are given, and it is quite near enough for any\r\nestimate. In the case of small works which have often to be executed\r\nwith great promptitude, lamentable delays have occurred owing to the\r\nengineer deferring the preparation of his estimate till he had got the\r\nline exactly fixed. Moreover there is a chance of the labour being\r\nthrown away in case the sanctioning authority directs any change in the\r\nalignment to be made.\r\n\r\nIn the case of a large scheme, a project estimate is prepared. In this\r\nthe earthwork and the area of land to be occupied are calculated pretty\r\naccurately. Designs and estimates are also prepared for the headworks\r\nand for the chief regulators. For works of which there are to be many of\r\none type--bridges, falls, distributary heads and small drainage\r\nsyphons--the cost is arrived at from lump sum figures, one drawing of\r\neach kind being submitted as a type. The distributaries are\r\napproximately estimated at mileage rates. In the case of a small scheme\r\neverything is estimated in detail except perhaps the distributaries or\r\nsome of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANAL WITH BRIDGE AND DISTRIBUTARY HEAD.\r\n\r\nThe Head has Gates and Winches.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 61._]\r\n\r\n\r\n9. =Design of a Distributary.=--A distributary is a canal in miniature\r\nand, like a canal, it may have branches. It has masonry bridges, falls\r\nand drainage syphons. It has, as already mentioned, a masonry regulator\r\nat its head. At the off-take of any branch or distributary there is a\r\nregulator in the head of the branch. If the branch takes off a large\r\nproportion of the water there is a double regulator. A distributary\r\ngives off watercourses as a canal gives off distributaries. The\r\nwatercourses belong to the people and not to Government and they are\r\ncleared and maintained by the people. Each watercourse has a masonry\r\nhead known as an “outlet” (Fig. 11). The outlet is the point where\r\nthe water passes from the hands of Government officials to those of the\r\ncultivators. The outlet is of masonry and its opening is not adjustable\r\nbut is fixed in such a way that its discharge, when the distributary is\r\nfull, bears, as nearly as can be arranged, the same ratio to the F.S.\r\ndischarge of the distributary as the area intended to be irrigated by\r\nthe watercourse bears to that intended to be irrigated by the\r\ndistributary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe floor of the outlet is level with the bed of the distributary. It\r\nthus draws off rolling sand which might otherwise accumulate in the\r\ndistributary. Small outlets are made of earthenware pipes, about ·4 feet\r\nin diameter, laid in concrete. Two pipes, or three, may be laid side by\r\nside. If more than three would be required, a masonry opening is\r\nadopted. The discharge through an outlet, is generally 2 to 5 c. feet\r\nper second per square foot of outlet area, and the head ·1 to ·5 feet.\r\n\r\nFor the tract of country allotted to any distributary, a contour map is\r\nprepared on a fairly large scale, say 4 inches to a mile. On the map\r\nthe line is laid down and a rough longitudinal section, showing the\r\nground level, is prepared as in the case of a canal.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated (Art. 4) that a distributary is so designed\r\nthat its water level, when three-fourths of the full supply is run,\r\nshall be well above the level of most of the ground along its course. In\r\nother words it should have a good command. A good rule is to allow a\r\nfall of ·5 feet from the level of the water in the distributary to that\r\nin the watercourse, a slope of 1 in 4,000 for the water flowing along\r\nthe watercourse, and a fall of ·3 feet for the water at the tail of the\r\nwatercourse to the level of the ground. This last level is, like the\r\nother ground levels, taken from the contour map. This procedure, in\r\nshort, consists in making the water level of the watercourse at its head\r\ngovern that of the distributary, just as the water level in the\r\ndistributary at its head was made to govern that in the canal.\r\n\r\nThe enlarged contour map of the distributary area shows, among other\r\nthings, the boundaries of the lands belonging to each village. Generally\r\na watercourse supplies water to only one village. When, however, a\r\nvillage is far from the distributary, its watercourse has to pass for a\r\nlong distance through other villages and it would be wasteful of water\r\nto have two separate watercourses. In such cases one watercourse may\r\nserve two villages or more. When a village is near to the distributary\r\nand its land extends for a long distance parallel to the distributary,\r\nit may have several watercourses for itself alone. A watercourse can\r\ngenerally be most conveniently dug along the boundary line of two\r\nvillages, or there may be some other line which the people particularly\r\ndesire.[15] Subject to, or modified by, these considerations a\r\nwatercourse is designed to run on high ground like a distributary.\r\n\r\n  [15] They also frequently wish the “chak”--the area irrigated by a\r\n  watercourse--so arranged that two men who are “enemies” shall not be\r\n  included in the same “chak.” This condition can be complied with only\r\n  up to a certain point. Arrangements may be modified but not in such a\r\n  way as to upset the proper rules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONTOUR MAP (PART) AND LINE OF DISTRIBUTARY.\r\n\r\nThe scale is 1 inch to 2 miles. The contour lines at 1 foot intervals\r\nare shown dotted, the roads by double lines. The line of the\r\ndistributary, in order to follow the ridge of the country, would have\r\ngone more to the left of the plan near the village. The shifting of the\r\nline to the right brings it nearer to the centre of the irrigated\r\ntract--supposed to be the whole area shown--and enables a single bridge\r\nto be built at the bifurcation of the two roads. Suitable lines for main\r\nwatercourses are shown in thin firm lines. It is assumed that the\r\ncommand is sufficient to enable the watercourses to run off at the\r\nconsiderable angles shown.\r\n\r\n_To face page 63_]\r\n\r\nThe great object is to reduce the total length of channels, _i.e._,\r\nminors and watercourses. No watercourse can be allowed to run alongside\r\nof or near to another. It may run alongside a canal or distributary when\r\nreally necessary to gain command but not otherwise. The longer the\r\nwatercourse the larger the chak. The discharge of an outlet may be\r\nanything up to 4 or 5 c. feet per second. This limits the size of a\r\nchak. If a chak is too big it can be split up or a minor can be\r\ndesigned. Very small chaks are to be avoided, but it is difficult to fix\r\na minimum size. The irrigation boundary of the distributary, as fixed in\r\nthe project, is shown on the map but in practice it will not be exactly\r\nfollowed. For various reasons the boundaries of a chak may run somewhat\r\noutside it or stop short of it.\r\n\r\nWhere a distributary gives off a minor and there is a double regulator,\r\nwatercourses should, as far as possible, be taken off from one or other\r\nof the branch channels and not from upstream of the double regulator.\r\nOtherwise, irregularities are likely to occur, both of the regulators\r\nbeing partially closed at the same time--a thing which is never\r\nnecessary in legitimate distribution of the supply--in order to head up\r\nthe water and increase the discharges of the outlets.\r\n\r\nA watercourse nearly always gives off branches and generally a system of\r\nturns is arranged by the farmers among themselves, each branch in turn\r\ntaking the whole discharge of the watercourse for a day or part of a\r\nday, the other branches being closed by small dams of earth. To irrigate\r\na field alongside the watercourse a gap is cut in its bank. For fields\r\nfurther away, smaller channels run off from the watercourses at numerous\r\npoints. Several gaps and several field channels may be in flow at one\r\ntime, and there is a dam in the watercourse below the lowest one.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, on an old canal, one watercourse crosses another, the\r\nlands irrigated being at different levels, but such crossings do not\r\noften occur in systems of watercourses laid out according to modern\r\nmethods. They are, however, quite legitimate.\r\n\r\nThe lines of the main watercourses are sketched on the map, their\r\nirrigation boundaries shown on it, and F.S. discharges allotted to them\r\naccording to the areas which are to be dependent on them. In order that\r\nthis may conveniently be done the “full supply duty” or “full supply\r\nfactor” for the distributary is obtained. It bears the same ratio to the\r\nordinary duty that the mean supply bears to the full supply. The total\r\nof the F.S. discharges of all the watercourses should, with an allowance\r\nfor loss by absorption in the distributary, be the same as the F.S.\r\ndischarge of the distributary. If the results are very discrepant it\r\nshows that the sizes of the outlets need revision. Possibly they may all\r\nbe too large.\r\n\r\nIn “colonization” schemes where a canal is constructed to irrigate waste\r\nlands--which are the property of Government and which are divided into\r\nsquare blocks and given out to colonists--Government has complete\r\ncontrol of the watercourse system, and can arrange it exactly as\r\ndesired, but in other cases landowners often strenuously oppose the\r\npassage of watercourses through their lands. Compulsory procedure\r\naccording to legal methods is tedious, but the practical rule is not to\r\nlet anyone have water until any watercourses which are to pass through\r\nhis land have been not only agreed to but constructed.\r\n\r\nIn ordinary cases Government possesses no power as to the precise line\r\non which a watercourse is dug. It fixes the site of the outlet and\r\nassigns certain land to it, and sketches out the line of the\r\nwatercourse. If the people choose to alter the line they can do so, but\r\ngreat alterations in the main watercourses are not generally feasible.\r\n\r\nThe positions of the outlets[16] having been settled after discussion\r\nwith the cultivators, a table is prepared showing the chainage of the\r\noutlets, the probable head or difference between the F.S. level of the\r\ndistributary and of the watercourse, and the F.S. discharge. From this\r\nthe sizes of the outlets are calculated and shown in another column. If\r\nthe length of the outlet barrel is not more than 5 or 6 times the\r\ndiameter--in the case of a barrel whose cross section is not round or\r\nsquare, the mean diameter--the discharge can be calculated as for a\r\n“short tube,” but if longer the formula for flow in pipes should be\r\nused, allowance being, of course, made for the head lost at the\r\nentrance. The outlets generally consist at first of wooden “shoots” or\r\nlong tubes, rectangular in cross section. This is because, after they\r\nhave been tested by a year or two years’ working, the sizes nearly\r\nalways require adjustment and the cultivators often wish to have the\r\nsite shifted.\r\n\r\n  [16] The positions can be slightly altered by the Engineers for any\r\n  sufficient reason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe uncertainty as to the proper size of an outlet is due to several\r\ncauses. If the command is very good there may be a clear fall from the\r\noutlet into the watercourse. In this case the discharge depends only on\r\nthe depth of water in the distributary, and is known pretty accurately.\r\nBut ordinarily the outlet is submerged, and its discharge depends on the\r\ndifference between the water levels in the distributary and in the\r\nwatercourse. The latter level is not fixed. The cultivators can lower\r\nit, to an extent which depends chiefly on the distance of the fields\r\nfrom the distributary, by deepening or widening the watercourse. In this\r\nway the discharge of the watercourse is increased except when a dam is\r\ntemporarily made in it for the purpose of irrigating any comparatively\r\nhigh land. This uncertainty as to the discharge can in some cases be got\r\nover by building a cistern (Fig. 11). This has the same effect as\r\nraising the level of the barrel, the real outlet being no longer\r\nsubmerged, and the discharge depending on the depth of the crest of the\r\noverfall below the water in the distributary. But such cisterns add\r\ngreatly to the cost of an outlet, and they can only be adopted when\r\nthere is good command. A great cause of uncertainty as to the proper\r\nsize of an outlet is the variability of the duty of the water on the\r\nwatercourse. The soil may be clayey or sandy, the watercourse may be\r\nshort or long, the crops grown may be ordinary ones or may be chiefly\r\nrice, which requires three or four times as much water as most other\r\ncrops, and the cultivators may be careful or the opposite. Again, the\r\npeople may, if the outlet gives a plentiful supply, often keep it\r\nclosed, but there is no record of such closures nor would the people\r\nadmit that they occur. These causes may all operate in one direction--on\r\na whole distributary this cannot happen to the same extent--and thus\r\nenormous differences in duty may occur. There is no way of arriving at\r\nthe proper size for an outlet except trial. Observations of the\r\ndischarges of the outlets are of very limited use. The discharge may\r\nvary according to the particular fields being irrigated. Observations of\r\ndischarges will be useful in cases where the people complain, or when\r\nthe discharge is obviously much greater or much less than intended and\r\nwill in such cases enable temporary adjustments to be made, but by\r\nplacing a dam in a watercourse and turning the water on to a high field\r\nnear its head the people can make it appear that the discharge is only a\r\nfraction of what it should be.\r\n\r\nOn any distributary there are generally some watercourses which have a\r\npoor command, the head at the outlet being, say, ·1 ft. or even less.\r\nProbably the irrigation is a good deal less than it should be. In such\r\ncases the rules may be set aside and a liberal size of outlet given. The\r\nsize may be 2 or 3 times the calculated size. There is no harm in this.\r\nThe irrigation cannot increase much. Similar cases frequently occur on\r\ninundation canals especially near the heads of canals or distributaries.\r\n\r\nThe construction of masonry outlets on a distributary is not usually a\r\nfinal settlement of the matter. Further adjustments become necessary.\r\nThis matter will be dealt with in CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOn the older canals little or insufficient attention was given to the\r\nquestion of the sizes of outlets. The sizes were far too great and, as\r\nlong as all the outlets in a distributary remained open, water could not\r\nreach the tail. The distributary used to be divided into two or three\r\nreaches and the outlets in the upstream reaches used to be closed\r\nperiodically. The closures had to be effected through the agency of\r\nnative subordinates and the system gave rise to corruption on a colossal\r\nscale. The tail villages never obtained anything like their proper share\r\nof water. The upper villages were over-watered and the soil was often\r\nwater-logged and damaged. Moreover, even if all concerned had the best\r\nintentions, it was impossible to stop all leakage in the closed outlets,\r\nexcept by making earthen dams in the watercourses, and great waste of\r\nwater resulted from this.\r\n\r\nThe water level of the distributary with ³⁄₄ full supply, designed so as\r\nto be at least ·5 ft. above the water level in the watercourse heads--or\r\nto be 1 foot above high ground if this simpler plan is adopted--is drawn\r\non the rough longitudinal section and also the line of F.S., falls being\r\nintroduced where desirable and the gradients, F.S. depths of water and\r\nwidths of channels being arranged, just as in the case of a canal, so as\r\nto give the required discharges, velocities suited to the soil and a\r\nsuitable ratio of depth to velocity. The bed width of a distributary\r\ndecreases in whole numbers of feet. The decrease occurs at outlets but\r\nnot at every outlet. As the channel becomes smaller its velocity becomes\r\nless and this necessitates, according to the laws of silting and scour,\r\na reduced depth of water. The height and width of the banks in the tail\r\nportion of a distributary should be made rather greater than\r\nelsewhere--regard being had to the depth and volume of the water--so\r\nthat breaches may not occur when the demand abruptly slackens. The\r\nlongitudinal section of a distributary should have horizontal lines for\r\nshowing the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Datum         |5. Draw-off      | 9. Bank width   |13.

It shows only\r\na few of the above items. In practice all would be shown, large sheets\r\nof paper being used with all the lines and titles printed on them.\r\n\r\nWhen a distributary is constructed the side slopes are made 1 to 1 in\r\nexcavation and 1¹⁄₂ to 1 in embankment. The sides usually silt up till\r\nthey are ¹⁄₂ to 1 or even vertical. The silting up to ¹⁄₂ to 1 is, as in\r\nthe case of a canal, allowed for in the designing. The berms are left so\r\nthat, if any part of the side falls in, the bank will not also fall in.\r\nThey also allow of widening of the channel. The remarks made in Art. 6\r\nregarding the design of banks, apply to distributaries, especially large\r\nones.\r\n\r\nOn a distributary there is seldom much spoil. Where there is no spoil, a\r\nstrip of land, outside the bank and 10 feet wide, can be taken up on\r\neither bank from which to obtain earth for repairs. On a minor the width\r\nof the strip is sometimes only 5 feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\nWhen a distributary passes through land which is irrigated from wells,\r\nit frequently cuts through the small watercourses which run from the\r\nwell to the fields. In such cases, either a syphon or a supplementary\r\nwell is provided at Government cost. If several watercourses, all from\r\nthe same well, are cut through, it is generally possible to combine them\r\nfor the purpose of the crossing. The wishes of the cultivators in this\r\nmatter are met as far as possible.\r\n\r\nThe procedure as regards laying out the line on the ground, digging\r\ntrial pits, correcting the line and preparing the estimate are the same\r\nas for the case of a canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\n\r\n10. =Best System of Distributaries.=--Let AB (Fig. 13) represent a\r\nportion of a distributary, the irrigation boundary CD being two miles\r\nfrom AB. In order to irrigate a rectangular plot ACDB, the main and\r\nbranch watercourses would be arranged somewhat as shown by the full and\r\ndotted lines respectively. Generally, the whole supply of the main\r\nwatercourse would be sent in turn down each branch, the other branches\r\nbeing then dry. The average length open is AGE. The ends of the branches\r\nlie on a line drawn say 200 feet from the lines BD and DC, since it is\r\nnot necessary for the watercourses to extend to the outside edges of the\r\nfields. Within the field there are small field watercourses which\r\nextend to every part of it. By describing three rectangles on AC, making\r\nAB greater than, equal to and less than AC, it can be seen that the\r\naverage length of watercourse open is least--relatively to the area of\r\nthe block--when AB is equal to AC, i.e., when the block served by the\r\nwatercourse is square as in the figure. If AB is 4 times AC, the average\r\nlength of watercourse open is increased--relatively to the area of the\r\nblock--in about the ratio of 3 to 2. Moderate deviations from a square\r\nare of little consequence.\r\n\r\nSuppose two parallel distributaries to be 4 miles apart, each of them\r\nbeing an average Indian one, say sixteen miles long with a gradient of\r\none in 4,000, and side slopes of ¹⁄₂ to 1, the bed width and depth of\r\nwater at the head being respectively 13·5 feet and 2·9 feet, and at the\r\ntail 3 feet and 1 foot. The discharge of the distributary, with N =\r\n·0225, will be 72 c. ft. per second. The discharge available for the 2\r\nmile strip along one bank will be 36 c. ft. per second. If the duty is\r\n300 acres per c. ft. the area irrigated in this strip will be 10,800\r\nacres, or 1,350 acres for each of the eight squares like ACDB. Each main\r\nwatercourse would then have to discharge 4·5 c. ft. per second.\r\nSupposing its gradient to be 1 in 4,000 and its side slopes ¹⁄₂ to 1 and\r\nN to be ·0225, its bed width would be 3 feet and depth of water 1·45\r\nfeet. Its wet border would be 6·3 feet, and its average length 5280√2 +\r\n5280 - 200 or 12,546 feet. Its wetted area would be 79,040 square feet,\r\nand the total wetted area of the 16 watercourses--on the two sides of\r\nthe distributary--would be 1,264,640 square feet. The wetted border of\r\nthe distributary itself is 19·5 feet at the head and 5 feet at the tail,\r\naverage 12·25 feet, and its wetted area is 5,280 × 16 × 12·25 or\r\n1,034,880 square feet.\r\n\r\nIf the distributaries were two miles apart, there would be twice the\r\nnumber of distributaries, and each square would be one square mile\r\ninstead of four. Each watercourse would have to discharge 1·125 c. ft.\r\nper second. It would have a bed width of 2 ft., depth of water ·8 ft.,\r\nwet border 3·8 feet, length 6,173 feet, and wetted area 23,457 feet. The\r\ntotal wetted area of the 64 water courses would be 1,501,248 square\r\nfeet, or 18 per cent. more than before. Each distributary would\r\ndischarge 36 c. ft. per second, the bed width and depth at the head\r\nbeing 10 feet and 2·24 feet, and at the tail 2 feet and ·75 feet. The\r\nwet border at the head and tail would be 14·5 and 3·5 feet, mean 9 feet,\r\nand the wetted area of the two distributaries would be 1,520,640 square\r\nfeet or 50 per cent. more than before. Supposing that, in the case of\r\nthe larger distributary considered above, the 2-mile square was\r\nconsidered too large, and that rectangles 1 mile wide were adopted, so\r\nthat the watercourses were a mile apart, their number would be doubled\r\nand their length and size reduced. Their total wetted area would not be\r\ngreatly affected, but the difference in the wetted areas of the two\r\nsmall distributaries as compared with the one large one, would be the\r\nsame as before. In practice, of course, distributaries are not always\r\nparallel, nor are the blocks of irrigation all squares, and frequently,\r\nowing to peculiarities in the levels of the ground or the features of\r\nthe country, or the boundaries of villages, it is necessary to align the\r\nwatercourses in a particular manner, or to construct more than one\r\nwatercourse where one would otherwise have sufficed, but the above\r\ncalculations show in a general way the advantages of large watercourses\r\nand of not placing the distributaries too near together.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly said that a watercourse discharging more than 4 or 5 c.\r\nft. per second is objectionable because the cultivators, if there are\r\ntoo many of them on one watercourse, cannot organize themselves in order\r\nto work it and keep it in order. This matter is much exaggerated. On the\r\ninundation canals of the Punjab a watercourse often discharges 10 c. ft.\r\nper second, and is several miles long and requires heavy clearances, but\r\nthe people have no particular difficulty in managing it. Kennedy, a\r\ngreat authority on questions of irrigation, states that the length of a\r\nwatercourse may be three miles. This, if the angle made by a watercourse\r\nwith the distributary is 45°, gives rather more than two miles as the\r\nwidth of the strip to be irrigated.\r\n\r\nSuppose that a distributary instead of being two miles from each side of\r\nthe irrigated strip, ran along one side of it, and was four miles from\r\nthe other side. If the block were square, as before, the side of a\r\nsquare would be 4 miles, and each watercourse would have to discharge 18\r\nc. ft. per second, which is far too much. The blocks would have to be\r\nrectangles, each being only one mile wide measured parallel to the\r\ndistributary. It has been already seen that the length of watercourse in\r\nthis case is greater than when the block is square and each side is two\r\nmiles. Thus centrality in the alignment of the distributary is an\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nA minor distributary has been defined (CHAPTER II., Art. 3) as being one\r\ndischarging not more than 40 c. ft. per second, but the term has come to\r\nbe used to designate a branch of a major distributary, and in that sense\r\nit will be used in this article. When the shape of the area commanded by\r\na distributary is such that watercourses exceeding 2 miles in length\r\nwould otherwise be required, one or more minors are often added.\r\nFrequently it is a question whether to let some of the watercourses be\r\nmore than two miles long, or to construct a minor and thus shorten the\r\nwatercourses to perhaps only one mile. Which method is best has not been\r\ndefinitely settled. It is known that the loss of water in watercourses\r\nis heavy, but if a minor is added the loss in it has to be considered.\r\nThe loss must be high in any channel in which the ratio of wet border to\r\nsectional area is small. The minor also costs money in construction and\r\nin maintenance. On the whole the matter, as far as concerns cost and\r\nloss of water, is, perhaps, almost evenly balanced, but as regards\r\ndistribution of the supply a system without minors is preferable. The\r\noff-take of a minor is generally far from the canal, i.e., in a more or\r\nless out-of-the-way place, and it is impossible to see that the\r\nregulation is properly carried out. Irregularities and corruption are\r\nsure to arise. Even if the supply is fairly distributed as between the\r\nminor and the distributary it is almost certain that the regulator, if a\r\ndouble one, will be manipulated for the illegal benefit of outlets in\r\nthe distributary upstream of the bifurcation. There are sure to be some\r\nsuch outlets not very far distant. In any case each minor adds one, if\r\nnot two, to the already very large number of gauges which have to be\r\nentered daily in the sub-divisional officer’s register (CHAPTER III.,\r\nArt. 3), and adds also to the mileage of channel to be inspected and\r\nmaintained. These considerations should, in many cases, though of course\r\nnot in all, turn the scale against the construction of a minor. At one\r\ntime it became usual to construct minors even when watercourses more\r\nthan two miles long would not otherwise have resulted. This custom was\r\ncondemned some years ago, and is not likely to be re-established. Most\r\nof the difficulties just mentioned can, in the case of a minor which is\r\nnot too large, either absolutely or relatively to the main distributary\r\ndownstream of the off-take, be got over by making the minor head like a\r\nwatercourse outlet, building it up to the proper size, removing the\r\nregulating apparatus and abolishing the reading of the gauge, but in\r\nthis case the minor is not likely to be bigger than a large watercourse.\r\nSuch minors should not be constructed, and any existing ones should,\r\nafter the head has been treated as above, be made over to the people and\r\nconsidered as watercourses.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. =Outlets.=--The top of the head and tail walls of an outlet are\r\nlevel with the F.S. levels in the distributary and watercourse\r\nrespectively. The steps in the head wall enable the cultivators to go\r\ndown either to stop up the outlet or to remove any obstruction. The\r\nstepping is arranged so as to fall inside the side slope ultimately\r\nproposed. It is usual, in some places, to have the entrance to the\r\n“barrel” of the outlet made of cast iron. The cast iron pieces are made\r\nof various standard sizes. This to some extent prevents the “barrel”\r\nbeing built to a wrong size. A discrepancy between the size of the\r\nmasonry barrel and that of the iron would be noticed, but if the masonry\r\nbarrel is built too large the iron head does not always restrict the\r\ndischarge. The action is the same as in a “diverging tube” well known in\r\nhydraulics.\r\n\r\nFor sizes up to about 50 or 60 square inches the barrel should be nearly\r\nsquare. For larger sizes the height should exceed the width. Up to\r\nabout 100 or 120 square inches the width can be kept down to 7 or 8\r\ninches so that an ordinary brick can be laid across to form the roof.\r\nFor larger outlets the height can be from 1·5 to 3 times the width, and\r\nthe roof can be made of large bricks, concrete blocks or slabs of stone\r\nor of a flat arch of brickwork or by corbelling, but in this last case\r\nthere should be two complete courses above the top of the outlet. The\r\nless the width the cheaper the roof, the easier the adjustment of size\r\nand the less the tendency to silt deposit during low supplies. If pipes\r\nare used they should be laid in concrete. If cast iron head pieces are\r\nto be used there should be several sizes of one width and the widths of\r\nthe masonry outlets should be made to suit these widths.\r\n\r\nA masonry outlet is not generally built till the watercourse has been\r\nsometime in use. The exact position of the outlet should then be so\r\nfixed that the watercourse shall run out straight or with a curve and\r\nshould not be crooked.\r\n\r\nThe width between parapets should be, for a driving road or one to be\r\nmade into such, 10 ft. (if the bank is wider, it should be narrowed just\r\nat the outlet site) and for a non-driving road, 8 feet to 3 feet\r\naccording to the ultimate width of the bank. Earth backing should be\r\nmost carefully put in and rammed, otherwise a breach may occur and the\r\noutlet be destroyed.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to provide gates or shutters for\r\noutlets. The chief result has been trouble and increased cost. If\r\ngrooves are made and shutters provided, the shutters are soon broken or\r\nlost by the people. Hinged flap shutters are objectionable because they\r\nare often closed by boys or by malicious persons or by neighbours who\r\nwish to increase the supply in their own outlet. The cultivator, when he\r\nwishes to reduce the supply or to close the outlet, can easily do this\r\nby obstructing the orifice with a piece of wood or an earthenware vessel\r\nor a bundle of brushwood or grass.\r\n\r\nAs regards temporary outlets, wooden outlets if large (unless made of\r\nseasoned wood and therefore costly) are liable to give great trouble.\r\nWater escapes round the outside or through the joints. Pipes may do well\r\nif laid in puddle but are brittle and costly if of large size. The\r\nirrigators may interfere both with wooden outlets and pipes and they are\r\nliable to be displaced or broken. A temporary outlet, if small, can be\r\nmade of bricks laid in mud. The joints can be pointed with lime mortar.\r\nWhen the outlet is made permanent the same bricks are used again. But\r\nall kinds of temporary outlets are liable to give trouble especially in\r\nlight or sandy soil. There is much to be said in favour of building\r\nmasonry outlets at the first, making a barrel only, _i.e._, omitting the\r\nhead and tail walls and taking the chance of having to alter the size.\r\nThe alteration is not very expensive. The head and tail walls are built\r\nwhen the size has been finally settled. The adjustment can be made by\r\nraising or lowering the roof. This should be done over the whole length\r\nof the outlet but lowering can be done temporarily over a length of 3\r\nfeet at the tail end of the outlet. This can be done even when the\r\ndistributary is in flow. A reduction over a short length at the upstream\r\nend of a barrel does not, as already remarked, necessarily reduce the\r\ndischarge much.\r\n\r\nOn inundation canals the rules regarding outlets have to be modified.\r\nGreat numbers of watercourses take off directly from the canals. In such\r\ncases, especially near the head of a canal, the ground to be watered is\r\noften 5 to 8 feet above the canal bed and it is wholly unsuitable to\r\nplace the outlet at bed level. The cost of the tail wall would be\r\nexcessive. The floor level in such cases must be at about the lowest\r\nprobable cleared bed level of the watercourse, say, in order to be safe,\r\na foot or half a foot below the usual cleared bed of the watercourse, so\r\nthat water need never be prevented from entering the watercourse. The\r\nirrigators should be consulted as to the floor level and their wishes be\r\nattended to as far as possible. For lift outlets the floor should be at\r\nthe bed level of the canal or distributary. If this bed is to be raised\r\nin the course of remodelling, the floor should be at the old bed level\r\nuntil the bed has actually been raised, unless there is a weir which\r\nraises the water. It is necessary that lift outlets should work however\r\nsmall the canal supply may be. In a distributary or small canal, the\r\nhead wall should be built up to F.S. level but in a canal with deep\r\nwater the head wall should reach up to just above the roof of the outlet\r\nand be submerged in high supplies. The stepping of the head wall should\r\nbe set back if the channel is to be widened and should project into the\r\nchannel if the channel is to be narrowed. The centre line of the channel\r\nnear the outlet site must always be laid down and the outlet built at\r\nright angles to it and also at the correct distance from it.\r\n\r\nOccasionally there is a wide berm, say 20 ft. or even 50 ft., between a\r\nchannel and its bank. In such a case the outlet should be built to suit\r\nthe bank. The long open cut is however objectionable because the people\r\nclear it and heap the spoil in Government land. Sometimes the bank,\r\nespecially if it is crooked, can be shifted so as to come close to the\r\nchannel at the outlet site. Sometimes the outlets on inundation canals\r\nare large. For outlets of more than 2·5 square feet in area, grooves\r\nshould be provided so that the cultivators can use a gate if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. =Masonry Works.=--The positions and descriptions of all the masonry\r\nworks of a proposed canal or distributary are of course shown on the\r\nlongitudinal section of the channel and from this the discharges and\r\nwater levels are obtained. The principles of design to be followed[19]\r\nfor bridges, weirs, falls, regulators and syphons, are discussed in\r\n_River and Canal Engineering_. It is mentioned that there is no special\r\nreason for making the waterway of a regulator exactly the same as that\r\nof the stream, and that the waterway may be such as to give the maximum\r\nvelocity considered desirable, and that the foundations of a bridge\r\nshould be made so deep that it will be possible to add a floor, at a\r\nlower level than the bed of the stream--with the upstream and downstream\r\npitching sloping up to the bed--so as to increase the waterway and so\r\nsave pulling down the bridge in case the discharge of the channel is\r\nincreased. It remains to consider certain points affecting Irrigation\r\nCanals.\r\n\r\n  [19] So far as concerns their capacity for dealing with flowing water.\r\n\r\nThe span of a bridge, where there are no piers, is generally made as\r\nshown by the dotted lines in Figure 14, so that the mean width of\r\nwaterway is the same as that of the channel. The arches, in Northern\r\nIndia, used at one time to be 60° as shown by the upper curved line, but\r\nin recent years arches of 90° as shown by the lower curved line, have\r\nfrequently been adopted, the springing of the arch being below the F.S.\r\nlevel, so that the stream is somewhat contracted. The 90° arch gives a\r\nreduced thickness and height of abutment. It causes increased\r\ndisturbance of the water, and this may necessitate more downstream\r\nprotection. An advantage of having the springing not lower than the F.S.\r\nlevel is that this admits of a raising of the F.S. level in case the\r\nchannel is remodelled, and this arrangement is still common on\r\ndistributaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nWhen a fall and bridge are combined, the bridge is placed below the fall\r\nas this gives a lower level for the roadway. The side walls of the fall\r\nare produced downstream to form those of the bridge.\r\n\r\nThe roads in India are generally unfenced and the banks of canals close\r\nto bridges, on both sides of the canal and both above and below the\r\nbridge, are generally more or less worn down by cattle, which, when\r\nbeing driven home in the evening and out to graze in the morning, go\r\ndown to the stream to drink. In order to prevent this damage the banks\r\nare sometimes pitched, above the bridge as well as below it, but the\r\ncattle generally make a fresh “ghát” further away. The best plan is to\r\nallow a “ghát” on one bank either above or below the bridge and to\r\nprotect the other three places.\r\n\r\nIn the Punjab the widths of roadways between the kerbs and parapets of\r\nbridges respectively have been fixed as follows:--\r\n\r\n  --------------+----------------+-------------------\r\n   KIND OF ROAD.| NEAR TOWNS.[20]|IN THE COUNTRY.[21]\r\n  --------------+------+---------+--------+----------\r\n                |Kerbs.|Parapets.| Kerbs. | Parapets.\r\n  --------------+------+---------+--------+----------\r\n  Provincial    |  22  |   23·5  |  16    |   17·5\r\n  District      |  18  |   19·5  |  14    |   15·5\r\n  Village       |  14  |   15·5  |   8·5  |   10\r\n  --------------+------+---------+--------+----------\r\n\r\n  [20] The figures show the maximum. The general width should be the\r\n  same as for neighbouring bridges on the same road.\r\n\r\n  [21] The parapets should be whitewashed so as to be visible at night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nFig. 15 shows a head regulator for a distributary. The scale is 10 feet\r\nto an inch. It has a double set of grooves for the insertion of the\r\nplanks with which the regulation is effected. Only one set of grooves is\r\nordinarily used, but when the distributary has to be closed for silt\r\nclearance and all leakage stopped, both sets of grooves can be used and\r\nearth rammed in between the two sets of planks. The floor is shown a\r\nfoot lower than the bed of the distributary. This reduces the action of\r\nthe water on the floor, and enables the bed of the distributary to be\r\nlowered if ever the occasion for this should arise. This is a good\r\nrule--in spite of the fact that in re-modellings the tendency is for the\r\nbeds to be raised--for all regulators or bridges, a raised sill being\r\nadded (in regulators) to reduce the length of the needles or the number\r\nof the planks. Such sill should, where needles are to be used, be fairly\r\nwide, especially if regulation is to be done while the masonry is\r\nsomewhat new. The distributary shown has a bed width of 10 ft. The span\r\nof the two openings in the head might have been four feet each, but are\r\nactually five feet, and this enables the distributary to be increased in\r\nsize at any time. The pitched portion of the channel tapers. Unless\r\nneedles are used, instead of horizontal planks, spans are not usually\r\ngreater than 5 or 6 feet. Longer spans would give rise to difficulties\r\nin manipulating the planks. Sometimes distributary heads are built skew,\r\nbut there is seldom or never any good reason for this. A curve can\r\nalways be introduced below the head to give the alignment the desired\r\ndirection.[22] The small circles shown on the plan are “bumping posts.”\r\nOn the left is shown a portion of the small raised bank at the edge of\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\n  [22] The curve can be quite sharp (see CHAP. I., Art. 2), and can be\r\n  made, if necessary, within the length of the pitching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nFigure 16 is a double regulator with needles. The scale is 30 feet to an\r\ninch. The spans are 15 feet. The roadway is on arches, but the\r\nregulating platform on steel beams. The needles are seen at the upstream\r\nsides of the regulators. They are worked from the platforms to which\r\naccess is obtained through the gaps in the upstream parapets. The\r\nregulating platform should generally be only just clear of the F.S.\r\nlevel, and therefore lower than the roadway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEEDLE REGULATOR AND BRIDGE.\r\n\r\nNeedles lying on Bank.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 85._]\r\n\r\nFrequently the roadway of a bridge or small regulator is carried, not on\r\narches, but on steel beams. The railings may be of wood or of gas pipe\r\nwith the ends plugged, running through angle iron posts. In the case\r\nof such a regulator the roadway is sometimes so light that camels are\r\nnot allowed to cross over. This causes unnecessary hardship. Bridges are\r\nnot too numerous. If the regulation is done by gates, both road and\r\nplatform are carried on arches.\r\n\r\nThe regulators on inundation canals, and some on perennial canals, are\r\nnot strong enough to admit of the flow of water being entirely stopped,\r\nso that the depth of water would be perhaps 10 feet upstream and nil\r\ndownstream. This might cause the overturning of the piers, or the\r\nformation of streams under the floor. In such cases a maximum\r\npermissible heading up is decided on. Such orders are, in India, liable\r\nto be lost sight of in course of time, and they are, at least on\r\ninundation canals, where sudden emergencies often occur, hardly\r\nreasonable. An engine driver is not told that he must never entirely\r\nclose his throttle valve. Regulators should be so designed that the\r\nwater can be completely shut off.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks show the chief points in favour of needles and\r\nhorizontal planks respectively.\r\n\r\n  _Advantages of Needles._ Needles can be placed or removed by one man.\r\n\r\n  Needles do not require hooks, etc., which are liable to be broken or\r\n  lost.\r\n\r\n  A needle regulator requires few piers, and is therefore cheap.\r\n\r\n  Water falling over planks throws a strain on the floor.\r\n\r\n  Regulation with needles is easy and rapid. A jammed plank, especially\r\n  if low down and not horizontal, may give great trouble.\r\n\r\n  _Advantages of Planks._ Floating rubbish is not liable to collect\r\n  above the Regulator because the water flows over the planks.\r\n\r\n  By means of double grooves and earth filling, leakage can be quite\r\n  stopped.\r\n\r\nFor large works the advantages are generally with needles, but for small\r\nworks, _e.g._ distributary heads and shallow water, with planks. Needles\r\n14 feet long are not too long for trained men. Planks are more likely\r\nthan needles to arrest rolling sand, and this can be taken into\r\nconsideration in designing double regulators. See number 8 of Kennedy’s\r\nrules, Article 5. When planks are used there should be two sets of\r\ngrooves. Planks are very suitable for escape heads which have only\r\noccasionally to be opened, earth being filled in between the two sets of\r\nplanks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16A]\r\n\r\nRegarding notched falls, in the case of small distributaries the notches\r\nare so narrow that they are extremely liable to be obstructed either\r\naccidentally by floating rubbish or wilfully by persons whose outlets\r\nare upstream of them. Weirs are not open to this objection, and are\r\nfrequently adopted. There is not the least chance of their causing any\r\nsilting worth mentioning. A simple weir if made of the proper height for\r\nthe F.S. discharge, will cause a slight heading up with ³⁄₄ths of the\r\nF.S. discharge, and this unfairly benefits any outlets for a\r\nconsiderable distance upstream of the weir. This difficulty can be got\r\nover by making the weir as in Fig. 16A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE AND NOTCH FALL.\r\n\r\nIn this case the usual practice of placing the bridge downstream of the\r\nfall has not been followed.\r\n\r\nThe gauge well is seen on the left bank.\r\n\r\n_To face p. 87._]\r\n\r\nFor cisterns below falls the usual rule for the depth is\r\n\r\n  K = H + ∛H √D\r\n\r\nwhere H is the depth of water in the upstream reach, and D is the\r\ndifference between the upstream and downstream water levels. Another\r\nrule for distributaries is\r\n\r\n      H + D\r\n  K = -----\r\n        3\r\n\r\nthe length of the cistern being 3 H and its width the bed width of the\r\nchannel.\r\n\r\nAt “incomplete” falls, i.e., where the tail water level is above the\r\ncrest, it is not unusual to construct a low-level arch, which forms a\r\nsyphon. The object is to allay the surging of the surface water.\r\n\r\nThe question of skew bridges has been dealt with in Art. 3. Another\r\nquestion is that of the heights of bridges. Irrigation channels,\r\nespecially the smaller ones, are very frequently at a high level, and\r\nbridges have ramps which are expensive to make and to maintain, and are\r\ninconvenient. The lowering of distributary bridges in such cases, so\r\nthat they become syphons, or nearly so, has often been advocated and is\r\nfrequently desirable. The bed should slope down to the floor and up\r\nagain. The heading up can be reduced by giving ample waterway, but it\r\nwill not be necessary to do this if there is head to spare. The fall in\r\nthe water surface can be recognised and shown on the longitudinal\r\nsection. The structure becomes one of the incomplete falls above\r\ndescribed. The crown of the arch can, if desirable, be kept above F.S.\r\nlevel, so that floating rubbish will not accumulate.\r\n\r\nThe width between the parapets of a regulator can be 10 feet in the case\r\nof a driving road. It may be less, according to the width of the bank,\r\nin other cases.\r\n\r\nThe upper layer of the floor of a bridge or regulator is of brick on\r\nedge. Below this there is a layer of brick laid flat, and below this,\r\nconcrete of a thickness ranging from ·5 feet to 3 feet. The thicknesses\r\nof piers range from 1·5 to 3 feet.\r\n\r\nThe bricks used for canal work in Northern India are 10 inches long,\r\n4⁷⁄₈ inches wide, and 2³⁄₄ inches thick. The thicknesses of walls are\r\nabout ·83, 1·25, 1·7, 2·1, 2·5 feet, and so on.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of ramps should be about 3 in 100 for district roads, and 5\r\nin 100 for village roads.\r\n\r\nRailings should be provided along the tops of high walls and top of\r\npitching near to public roads or canal patrol roads. Bumping posts\r\nshould be provided for all parapets, and should not be so placed as to\r\nseriously obstruct the roadway.\r\n\r\nThe quarters for the regulating staff should, when convenient, be in the\r\nfork between the two principal branches. They may be on the bank--with\r\nfoundations on pillars carried down to ground level--but not in such a\r\nposition as to obstruct the road or any road likely to be made. Rests\r\nconsisting of two parallel timbers bolted to blocks of masonry reaching\r\nup a foot from the ground, should be provided for the needles or planks.\r\nThe bolt head should be countersunk so as not to damage the needles and\r\nplanks when they are hurriedly laid down.\r\n\r\nWhen two or more works are close together they should be made to\r\nconform, and the whole site should be considered with reference to a\r\nneat and suitable arrangement of works, ramps and roadways. If an outlet\r\nis near to a minor or distributary head the parapets of the two should\r\nbe in line. If two masonry works of any kind are near together it is\r\noften suitable to pitch the intervening space. If there are outlets or\r\ndistributaries on opposite banks they should be exactly opposite each\r\nother. Where a road crosses a bridge or regulator, the bank should be at\r\nthe same level as the road, the bank being gradually ramped back to its\r\noriginal level. The space in front of any quarters should have a slight\r\nslope for drainage, but otherwise be at one level and be connected with\r\nthe road or bank by proper ramps. The berm or bank should be made at the\r\nexact level of the top of any pitching or side wall which adjoins it.\r\nWing walls are frequently made too short, so that the earth at their\r\nends forms a steep slope and is worn away, and the bank or roadway is\r\ncut into. The walls should extend to such a point that the earth at\r\ntheir ends cannot assume a slope steeper than the slope of the bank.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that for every masonry work there should be a large scale\r\nsite plan[23] showing all roads, ramps, and adjoining works, both\r\nexisting and proposed roads being shown for some little distance from\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n  [23] It is, or was until recently, in some parts of India, the custom\r\n  to omit the preparation of site plans, and to leave the fixing of the\r\n  exact site of a work and the arrangement of ramps and other details to\r\n  the judgment of the assistant engineer who was building it. Much\r\n  unsightly work resulted. A chief engineer in the Punjab recently\r\n  issued some orders on the subject.\r\n\r\nFor each kind of masonry work there is usually a type design. A few of\r\nits dimensions, which are fixed, are marked on it. The other dimensions\r\nare variable. It would be a great advantage to add to the design a\r\ntabular statement to show how these dimensions should vary under\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\n13. =Pitching.= The object of pitching upstream of bridges or regulators\r\nor downstream of bridges where there may be little or no scouring\r\naction, may be partly to protect the bank from damage by cattle or wear,\r\nor to prevent sandy sides from falling in. In such cases there may be\r\npitching of the sides only, and it may be of brick on edge laid dry and\r\nunder this one brick flat resting on rammed ballast (Fig. 17).\r\nDownstream of regulators or weirs and downstream of bridges if\r\ncontracted or having piers which cause a rush of water, especially if\r\nthe soil is soft, the side pitching may be as above, but with the bricks\r\nover one-sixth of the area placed on end and projecting for half their\r\nlength. This “roughened pitching” tends somewhat to reduce the eddying.\r\nThe bed protection should be solid concrete or blocks of concrete or\r\nmasonry. Immediately downstream of regulators or weirs where there is\r\ngreat disturbance, both side and bed pitching may consist of solid\r\nconcrete or of concrete or masonry blocks (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nThree kinds of toe walls are shown in Figures 17, 19 and 20. The kind\r\nshown in Fig. 19 contains, for a given depth below the bed, far more\r\nmasonry than the one shown in Fig. 17. It is also liable to be displaced\r\nand broken if scour occurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe earth should in all cases be carefully cut to the proper slope, so\r\nthat no made earth has to be added. If the slope has already fallen in\r\ntoo much, well rammed earth should be added. The flat brick and rammed\r\nballast can be varied as the work proceeds, more being used in soft\r\nplaces and less in hard.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the Punjab, large bricks, the length, breadth, and\r\nthickness being about twice the corresponding dimensions of an ordinary\r\nbrick, are made, and are extremely useful and cheap for pitching. Where\r\nthe soil is sandy such bricks can be burned without cracking.\r\n\r\nSometimes the curtain wall which runs across the bed at the downstream\r\nend of the pitching is carried into the banks and built up so as to form\r\na profile wall (Fig. 21). This is not very suitable, because the\r\npitching of the sides is apt to settle and leave the profile wall\r\nstanding out. It is better to lay a row of blocks on the slope. If a\r\nhole tends to form in the bed downstream of the curtain wall, blocks of\r\nmasonry or concrete can be laid and left to take up their own positions\r\n(Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\nWhen scour of the bed or sides occurs downstream of pitching, it is\r\nsometimes said that any extension of the pitching downstream is followed\r\nby extension of the scour. This may happen if the cross section of the\r\nstream downstream of the pitched section has become greater than the\r\npitched section. In this case there is eddying, due to abrupt\r\nenlargement of the stream where the pitching ends. The increased width\r\nand lowered bed level (not counting mere local hollows) of the stream\r\nshould be adhered to in the pitching. Where the masonry of the regulator\r\nends and the pitching begins, there will be an abrupt or tapered\r\nenlargement, but the eddies--at very low supplies there may be a\r\nfall--cannot do harm.\r\n\r\nThis principle of enlarging the pitched cross section can be followed,\r\neven in a new channel, if the soil is light and scour is feared, and for\r\nthis reason the matter is mentioned in the present Chapter instead of\r\nin Chapter III. It was once the custom to splay out the sides of a\r\nchannel, downstream of a regulator or weir, so as to form a sort of pool\r\nin which the eddies exhausted themselves, but this gives curved banks\r\nand requires extra land and is not a very convenient or neat\r\narrangement. Where scour of the sides is likely to occur, or has\r\noccurred, immediately downstream of the pitching the latter may be\r\nturned in as shown in Fig. 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\nPitching has constantly to be replaced or extended owing, generally, to\r\nfailure to pitch a sufficient length or to ram well the earth under the\r\npitching, or to use properly rammed ballast or flat brick, or to give\r\nproper bed protection, or to the use of dry brick pitching when a\r\nstronger kind is needed.\r\n\r\nThe side slopes of pitching should be 1 to 1. They can be ¹⁄₂ to 1 in\r\nrare cases, _e.g._, when there is no room for 1 to 1, or in continuation\r\nof existing ¹⁄₂ to 1 pitching. No absolute rule can be laid down as to\r\nthe length to be pitched, but in a Punjab distributary it is often about\r\n5 times the bed width.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. =Miscellaneous Items.= On Indian canals the chainage[24] is marked\r\nat every thousand feet. Five thousand feet is called a “canal mile.”\r\nThe distance marks are often cast iron slabs, fixed in a cylindrical\r\nblock of brickwork about 2·1 feet in diameter and 1·5 feet high, the\r\nupper edge being rounded to a radius of ·4 feet. The wedge-shaped bricks\r\nfor these blocks are specially moulded. The iron slab should project\r\nabout eight inches and have about a foot embedded in the brickwork.\r\n\r\n  [24] In India, instead of the simple word “chainage” the term “reduced\r\n  distance” is used. It is the distance reduced to a common starting\r\n  point as levels are reduced to mean sea level. The expression is\r\n  puzzling to non-professionals and new comers.\r\n\r\nOn a canal having a wide bank the distance mark is put at the outer edge\r\nof the patrol bank, earth being added, if necessary, to increase the\r\nwidth. On a distributary with a narrow bank the mark should be on the\r\nopposite bank not the patrol bank. To enable the miles to be easily\r\ndistinguished the masonry block can be sunk only ·5 foot in the ground,\r\nthe others being sunk a foot. In all cases the masonry block rests on a\r\npillar, 1·7 feet square, of bricks laid in mud, carried down to the\r\nground level.\r\n\r\nProfile walls (Fig. 21, page 92) used occasionally to be built at\r\nfrequent intervals along a distributary. They will not prevent scour\r\noccurring, if the stream is tending to scour, unless very close\r\ntogether. Such walls are of some use as showing whether the channel is\r\naltering, but they are expensive and have to be altered if, as often\r\nhappens, the channel is remodelled. It is a much better plan to lay down\r\nblocks--about 1¹⁄₄ foot cubes--of masonry or concrete, along the centre\r\nline at every 500 feet, with their upper faces level with the bed. If\r\nthe bed scours they may be displaced but otherwise they are useful not\r\nonly for showing what silt, if any, has deposited, but for showing the\r\ncentre line of the channel. Without them the centre line is liable to be\r\naltered in silt clearances or berm cuttings. To enable a block to be\r\nreadily found and to be replaced in proper position if displaced, there\r\nshould be two small concrete pillars exactly opposite to it and\r\nequidistant from it, one on either bank of the channel. Such blocks and\r\npillars may with advantage be placed at quite short intervals on curves.\r\n\r\nThe rest houses for the use of officials on tour are generally at\r\nintervals of about 8 to 14 miles. There is generally a rest house near\r\nto a large regulator and frequently there is one near to a small\r\nregulator. This facilitates inspection work and discharge observations\r\nand it saves money, because the house can be looked after by one of the\r\nregulating staff. Not infrequently the house is placed just too far away\r\nfrom the regulator. Similarly if a rest house is near a railway station\r\nit should be within a quarter of a mile of it--always provided that this\r\ndoes not bring it too near to villages or huts--and not a mile or more\r\naway as is sometimes the case. It is also a mistake to place a rest\r\nhouse off the line of channel unless perhaps when it is on a district\r\nroad which crosses the channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE WORKING OF A CANAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.= A large canal is under a Superintending\r\nEngineer and it often constitutes his sole charge. It consists generally\r\nof three to five “divisions,” each under an Executive Engineer. A\r\ndivision has two to four subdivisions, each under a Subdivisional\r\nOfficer. A subdivision is divided, for purpose of engineering work and\r\nmaintenance, into several, generally three or four, sections, each\r\nconsisting of some 20 miles of canal and some 40 miles of distributary,\r\nand being in charge of a native overseer or suboverseer, and for\r\npurposes of water distribution and revenue, into a few sections each\r\nhaving, perhaps, some 30,000 acres of irrigation and being in charge of\r\na native zilladar. As far as possible the boundaries of divisions and\r\nsubdivisions are co-terminous with those of the branches of the canal. A\r\ndistributary is always wholly within a subdivision. At every regulator\r\nthere is a gauge reader, who, supplied when necessary with permanent\r\nassistants, sees to the regulation of the supply. If there is a\r\ntelegraph office at the regulator the telegraph “signaller” may have\r\ncharge of the regulation. The zilladar has a staff of some ten or twelve\r\npatwaris, who record in books the fields watered and who are in touch\r\nwith the people and know when the demand for water is great, moderate or\r\nsmall, and for what kind of crops it is needed. In each division there\r\nis generally a Deputy Collector who is a native official, ranking as a\r\nSubdivisional Officer. His duty is to specially supervise the revenue\r\nstaff in the whole division. Both he and the Subdivisional Officer have\r\nmagisterial powers which are exercised in trying petty cases connected\r\nwith the canal.\r\n\r\nAlong a main canal and its branches there is nearly always a “canal dak”\r\nor system of conveyance of bags containing correspondence for the\r\nofficials stationed on the canal or touring along it. Along the main\r\nline, and most of the way down the branches, there is a line of\r\ntelegraph for the special use of the canal officials. The telegraph\r\noffices are at the chief regulators, with tapping stations, for the use\r\nof officials on tour, at the rest houses near to which the line runs.\r\n\r\nHowever carefully a canal has been designed, alterations in the channels\r\nfrom silting and scour soon take place and they go on more or less\r\nwithout cessation. In a distributary, especially if the gradient has of\r\nnecessity been made somewhat flat, there is quite likely to be a deposit\r\nin the upper reach. The deposit is generally greatest at the head and\r\ndecreases, in going downstream, at a fairly uniform rate. It may extend\r\nfor half-a-mile or less or more. Or a deposit may occur on the sides,\r\nwhich grow out and contract the channel. This often occurs over a great\r\nlength of a distributary or even over the whole of it. Sometimes a\r\ndistributary scours its bed, or the sides may fall in somewhat.\r\nClearances of the silt and cutting of the berms are effected at\r\nintervals. Falling in of the sides may be stopped by means of bushing,\r\nand scour of the bed may be stopped by raising the crest of a fall or by\r\nintroducing a weir, but in the meantime the changes cause the discharge\r\ntables for the distributary to become more or less erroneous. In many\r\ncases silt deposits in the upper part of the distributary during the\r\nsummer months when the river water is heavily silted and scours away\r\nagain in the winter, the régime of the channel being, on the whole,\r\npermanent. The changes which occur in the branches and main canal are\r\nsimilar to the above and the remedies adopted are similar. On some of\r\nthe older canals the scour was so serious that many intermediate weirs\r\nhad to be constructed. The remarkable silting in the head reach of the\r\nSirhind Canal has been described in _River and Canal Engineering_,\r\nChapter V. The remedy consisted in keeping the gates of the\r\nunder-sluices properly closed so that a pond was formed in which the\r\nriver silt deposited. When necessary the canal is closed, the sluices\r\nopened, and the silt scoured away. For a plan of the headworks see fig.\r\n24.\r\n\r\nIn working a canal, it is necessary to arrange so that the water sent\r\ndown any channel is as nearly as possible in accordance with the demand.\r\nThe zilladar supplies the Subdivisional Officer, every week or ten days,\r\nwith an “indent” showing how much water is required in each distributary\r\nand the Subdivisional Officer makes indents on the subdivision next\r\nabove. The officer in charge of the headworks thus knows what the demand\r\nis. When it is more than the supply available, the water is dealt out to\r\nthe various divisions according to rules approved of by the\r\nSuperintending Engineer of the canal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nEvery gauge-reader has to be given definite instructions as to the gauge\r\nreading to be maintained, until further orders, in each distributary. At\r\nthe places where the large branches take off, the gauge reader is\r\ninstructed what gauge to maintain in each. In the event of too much\r\nwater arriving, he turns the surplus into the escape if there is one. If\r\nthere is no escape he has usually to raise the gauge readings of the\r\nbranches by equal amounts. By means of the telegraph, adjustment is\r\npromptly effected at the headworks.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that rain may cause an abrupt reduction\r\nin, or even cessation of the demand for water. At the same time it\r\nincreases the actual supply. Rain, or the signs of rain, in any part of\r\na canal system ought always to be reported to the other parts. Owing to\r\nchanges in the channels, to fluctuation in the water level of the river,\r\nespecially during the night, to rain or to changes in the temperature\r\nand moisture of the air and to lack of continuous attention on the part\r\nof the gauge reader, particularly at night, there is a constant, though\r\nperhaps small, fluctuation in the water level in all parts of a canal.\r\n\r\nIt may happen that--owing to enlargement of the channels by scour, or to\r\nother causes--the channels of a canal system are able to carry more\r\nwater than was intended. In such cases the channels are usually run with\r\nas much as they can carry. This may give a lavish supply and a lowered\r\nduty, but it increases the irrigated area. To restrict the supply would\r\ncause loss of revenue. Sometimes however, it is restricted to prevent\r\nwater-logging of the soil. The proper procedure is to extend the canal\r\nto other tracts.\r\n\r\nIn India the farmers pay for the water, not according to the volume\r\nused, but according to the area irrigated. Different rates per acre are\r\ncharged for different kinds of crops according to the varying amounts\r\nof water which they are known to require. Sugarcane, which is sown in\r\nthe spring and stands for nearly a year before being cut, thus extending\r\nover the whole of the kharif and most of the rabi, is assessed at the\r\nhighest rate. Next comes rice which crop, though only four or five\r\nmonths elapse between its sowing and reaping, requires a great quantity\r\nof water. Gardens which receive water all the year round also pay a high\r\nrate. Other kharif crops are cotton and millet. The chief rabi crops are\r\nwheat, barley and “gram.”\r\n\r\nEvery field irrigated is booked by a patwari who is provided with a\r\n“field map” and “field book” for each village (perhaps 6 or 8) in his\r\nbeat. The map enables him to recognise at a glance the field in which he\r\nis standing. It has a number in the map and, by referring to this number\r\nin the field book, he finds the area of the field. The patwari is also\r\nprovided with a “field register” in which he books each field which is\r\nwatered, showing its area and the kind of crop grown, the date of\r\nbooking and the name of the owner and tenant. He goes about entering up\r\nall new irrigation and his proceedings are subjected to rigorous check\r\nby the zilladar and Deputy Collector, and also by the engineering staff.\r\nAt the end of the crop the entries are abstracted into a “demand\r\nstatement” in which all the fields cultivated by one person are brought\r\ntogether and, the proper rates being applied to them, the sum payable by\r\nthis person is arrived at. The demand statement goes to the Collector of\r\nthe district, who levies the money and pays it into the Treasury to the\r\ncredit of the canal concerned. There is a special charge for any land\r\nwatered in an “unauthorised manner.” This includes taking water when it\r\nwas another man’s turn, or taking it from an outlet which has been\r\nwilfully enlarged or--in some districts--from another man’s outlet even\r\nwith his consent. The sizes of the outlets are carefully apportioned to\r\nthe land allotted to them and the area which they irrigate is constantly\r\nbeing looked into in order to see if the size is correct or needs\r\naltering. If a man borrows water from another outlet such borrowing may\r\nor may not come to light but in any case confusion as to outlet sizes\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe water rates charged for ordinary authorised irrigation are decidedly\r\nlow. In one district there was a case in which a man, being unable to\r\nget as much water as he needed from his own outlet, took water for some\r\nfields, by permission, from a neighbour’s outlet. This being found out\r\nhe was charged for those fields at double the usual rate. He continued\r\nregularly to use the water and to pay the double rate. There were\r\nseveral cases of this kind in that one district.\r\n\r\nSince payment for the water is not made according to the volume used,\r\nthe cultivators are more or less careless and wasteful in using it. As a\r\nrule they over-water the land and frequently damage or spoil it by\r\nwater-logging. They do not always keep in proper order the banks of the\r\nwatercourses. The banks often breach and water escapes. Any area thus\r\nflooded is charged for if it is seen by an official. The engineers have\r\npower to close such a watercourse until it is put in order, but this\r\nwould cause loss of revenue and is not often done. The real remedy for\r\nall this is, as already stated, rigid restriction of the supply. The\r\npeople will then learn--they are already learning--to use water more\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nWhen the crop in any field or part of a field fails to come to maturity,\r\nthe water rate on it is remitted. The failed area is known, in the\r\nPunjab, as “kharába.” On some canals the failed areas are liable to be\r\nlarge and an irrigation register, in order to be complete, has to show\r\nthem or, what is the same thing, to show both the gross and the net\r\nareas, the latter being the area left after deducting the kharába or\r\nremitted area.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Gauges and Regulation.=--In every canal, branch and major or minor\r\ndistributary there is a “head gauge” below the head regulator. At every\r\ndouble regulator there is a gauge in each branch and also an upstream\r\ngauge. These gauges are used for the regulation of the supply. The zeros\r\nof the gauges are at the bed levels. Tables are prepared showing the\r\ndischarges corresponding to each gauge reading--except in the case of\r\nupstream gauges--at intervals of ·1 foot.\r\n\r\nThe question often arises whether it is necessary to have a gauge near\r\nthe tail of a distributary. If the outlets have not been properly\r\nadjusted and if water does not reach the tail in proper quantity, a tail\r\ngauge is absolutely essential and its readings should be carefully\r\nwatched by the Sub-divisional Officer. To take no action until\r\ncomplaints arise or until the irrigation returns at the end of the crop\r\nshow that some one has suffered, is not correct. When it is known that\r\nsufficient water always reaches the tail, a tail gauge is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThere may be intermediate gauges on a canal or branch or distributary.\r\nFor convenience of reading they are usually at places where a\r\ndistributary or minor takes off or where there is a rest house. They\r\nserve to show whether the water level at that place alters while that\r\nat other places is stationary, and thus give indications of any changes\r\noccurring in the channel. The number of such intermediate gauges should\r\nbe rigorously kept down. In fact hardly any are necessary. The gauge\r\nregister which the Subdivisional Officer has to inspect daily, is, in\r\nany case, voluminous enough.\r\n\r\nAt a double regulator it is never necessary, except as a very temporary\r\narrangement in case of an accident, to partially close both channels at\r\nonce. One or the other should be fully open. The upstream gauge reading\r\nshows whether this rule is being adhered to. If the bed levels of all\r\nthree channels at the regulator are the same, the reading on one or\r\nother of the downstream gauges should be about the same--for the fall in\r\nthe water passing through an open regulator is generally negligible--as\r\nthat of the upstream gauge. In other cases the difference in the bed\r\nlevels has to be taken into account.\r\n\r\nImmediately downstream of the off-take of a channel, there is, unless\r\nthe water flows in without any appreciable fall, much oscillation of the\r\nwater. For this reason the gauge is frequently fixed some 500 feet down\r\nthe channel. This is anything but a good arrangement. The gauge-reader’s\r\nquarters are close to the off-take and he will not keep going down to\r\nthe gauge. Moreover an official coming along the main channel cannot see\r\nthe gauge. The gauge should be close to the head and in a gauge well\r\nwhere oscillations of the water are reduced to very small amounts. The\r\nupstream gauge requires no well.[25]\r\n\r\n  [25] For further details as to gauges see Appendix G.\r\n\r\nAll gauges should be observed daily, in the morning, and the reports\r\nsent by canal dak, post or wire at the earliest possible moment. This\r\nshould be rigidly enforced. The register should be posted and laid\r\nbefore the Subdivisional Officer daily with the least possible delay. It\r\nis only in this way that the Subdivisional Officer can keep proper\r\ncontrol of the water, and detect irregularities. Sometimes trouble\r\narises owing to the gauge reports not coming in regularly. The\r\nsuboverseer can be made responsible for seeing to this matter as regards\r\nall the gauge readers in his section. Gauge readers often reduce the\r\nsupply in a branch or distributary at night for fear of a rise occurring\r\nin the night and causing a breach. This is to save themselves the\r\ntrouble of watching at night. They are also bribed to tamper with the\r\nsupply and run more or less in any channel or keep up the supply for a\r\nlonger or shorter time. All regulation should be rigorously checked by\r\nthe suboverseer, zilladar and Subdivisional Officer. Irregularities can\r\nbe speedily detected if proper steps are taken such as going to the\r\nregulator unexpectedly. The watermarks on the banks can also be seen. If\r\nany man is found to have delayed entering a gauge reading in his book or\r\ndespatching the gauge report it is evidence of an intention to deceive.\r\nThe suboverseer or zilladar should be required to enter in his note-book\r\nall the checks he makes and the Subdivisional Officer should see the\r\nentries and take suitable steps.\r\n\r\nThere was formerly a general order in the Punjab that the Subdivisional\r\nOfficer should write the gauge register with his own hand. Such an order\r\nis not now considered necessary nor has the Subdivisional Officer,\r\nnow-a-days, time to comply with it. The register should however be\r\nwritten by the clerk carefully and neatly and not be made over to anyone\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nThe regulation should usually be so effected that rushes of water in any\r\nportion of the channel are avoided, but if scour occurs in a particular\r\npart of the channel it may be necessary to try and obtain slack water\r\nthere. Until it is proved by experience that they are unnecessary,\r\nsoundings should be taken periodically downstream of large works. When a\r\nbranch or escape is closed the leakage should be carefully stopped. The\r\nnecessary materials should be always kept ready in sufficient quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Gauge Readings and Discharges.= For the head gauge of each\r\ndistributary and for certain gauges in the canals, discharge tables,\r\nbased on actual observations, are prepared. If changes occur in the\r\nupper part of a channel, the discharge corresponding to a given gauge\r\nreading is altered. One remedy for this is to have a second gauge\r\ndownstream of the “silt wedge” or scoured or narrowed reach. The indents\r\nare then made out with reference to the second gauge, but any slight\r\nadjustments due to fluctuation in the water level of the canal, are\r\neffected by means of the head gauge. Unless the zilladar and\r\nSubdivisional Officer are on the alert, the gauge reader is likely to\r\nevade going to the lower gauge every morning, and to enter fictitious\r\nreadings for it, inferring them from the readings of the head gauge. If\r\nthere are any outlets between the two gauges, their discharge has to be\r\nobserved or estimated and added to the discharge of the distributary as\r\nentered in the table corresponding to the readings on the second gauge.\r\nThe above system can be worked with advantage in cases where the\r\ndistributary bifurcates two or three miles from its off-take. The men in\r\ncharge of the two regulators can work together, one of them or an\r\nassistant, going daily from one regulator to the other and back.\r\n\r\nUsually, however, the vitiating of the discharge table at the head gauge\r\nhas to be faced, and the table to be constantly corrected. It is\r\nimpossible to frame beforehand any rule or formula which would give a\r\ncertain correction for a certain depth of silt deposit. Moreover, there\r\nmight or might not be a contraction of the channel due to deposit on the\r\nsides. The usual plan is to observe a discharge some time during each\r\nmonth. If the result is in excess of the tabular discharge, all the\r\ndischarges for that month are increased in the same proportion. They can\r\nbe booked according to the table and totalled, and the correction\r\napplied to the total.\r\n\r\nDischarges of canals and branches at their heads or at the boundaries of\r\ndivisions, are observed by the Subdivisional Officer about once a month.\r\nDischarges of distributaries are observed about once a month, usually by\r\nzilladars. They are also to some extent observed by the Subdivisional\r\nOfficer, but much is left to his discretion. Delta is worked out for\r\neach distributary month by month, and also, of course, for each crop.\r\nThus a general duty “at distributary heads” can be obtained, and may be\r\nused in new projects[26] instead of the duty at the canal head,\r\nallowance being made for the water lost by absorption in the canal and\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n  [26] See CHAP. IV., Art. 2.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be said that these important figures are obtained as carefully\r\nas they could be. If the Subdivisional Officer personally observed the\r\ndischarge at each distributary head, even every other month, the\r\nreliability of the results would be much increased. In addition to this\r\nthe discharges of canals and branches at the boundaries of subdivisions\r\nshould be observed and the results compared with the distributary\r\ndischarges, so as to show the loss by absorption. At first grave\r\ndiscrepancies among the results would be found, but they would be\r\nreduced as the causes of error became known. For the method of\r\ninvestigating the causes of discrepant discharges see _River and Canal\r\nEngineering_, CHAP. III., Art. 5.\r\n\r\nA specimen of a Subdivisional Officer’s gauge register is given in table\r\nI. The zilladar keeps a similar register. The columns headed G contain\r\nthe gauge readings, those headed D the discharges. Until some years ago\r\nthere were no columns for discharges. The daily discharges of the canal\r\nand of the branches at their heads--and at intermediate points if they\r\nwere at the boundaries of divisions--were entered in the Executive\r\nEngineer’s office and the duty was worked out at the end of each crop.\r\nThe zilladar merely indented for a certain gauge reading at the\r\ndistributary head, and the Subdivisional Officer could tell pretty\r\nnearly what gauge reading he required in the canal at the beginning of\r\nhis subdivision. Since the year 1900 or thereabouts, the zilladars have\r\nbeen required to learn a good deal about discharges. They have to know\r\nhow to observe the discharge of a distributary, and to learn how the\r\ndischarge of an outlet varies with the head or difference between the\r\nupstream and downstream water levels. They are supposed to indent for\r\ncertain discharges, and not merely for certain gauge readings. All this\r\nknowledge is useful to the zilladars and tends to increase their\r\nefficiency, but a practice of constantly thinking in discharges instead\r\nof in gauge readings is unnecessary. If the channels were of all sorts\r\nof sizes matters would be different. Actually the size of a channel is\r\napportioned to its work, and the proportion of its full supply which it\r\nis carrying at any moment is easily grasped by means of gauge readings\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nTABLE I--GAUGE AND DISCHARGE REGISTER.\r\n\r\n  --------------+-----+---------------------------------------\r\n  October, 1912.|     |  Main Line, Upper Bari Doab Canal.\r\n                |     +-------------------------+------------+\r\n                |     |     Tibri Regulator     |  Dhariwal  |\r\n                |     +-----+---------+---------+------------+\r\n                |     |Above|  Main   |  Kasur  |   Nangal   |\r\n                |     |     |  Canal  |  Branch |Distributary|\r\n                |     +-----+----+----+---------+-----+------+\r\n                |Date.| _G._|_G._|_D._|_G._|_D._| _G._| _D._ |\r\n                |     |-----+----+----+----+----+-----+------+\r\n                |     |     |    |    |    |    |     |      |\r\n                |     |     |    |    |    |    |     |      |\r\n                |   1 |     |    |    |    |    |  4·0|  100 |\r\n                |   2 |     |    |    |    |    |  4·0|  100 |\r\n                |   3 |     |    |    |    |    |  4·0|  100 |\r\n                |  *  |  *  | *  | *  | *  | *  |  *  |   *  |\r\n                |  29 |     |    |    |    |    |  4·2|  110 |\r\n                |  30 |     |    |    |    |    |  4·2|  110 |\r\n                |  31 |     |    |    |    |    |  4·2|  110 |\r\n  --------------+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+-----|------+\r\n    Total             |     |    |    |    |    |127·1| 3255 |\r\n  --------------------+-----+----+----+----+----+-----|------+\r\n  No. of days in flow |     |    |    |    |    | 31  |   31 |\r\n  --------------------+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+------+\r\n    Average           |     |    |    |    |    |  4·1|  105 |\r\n  --------------------+-----+----+----+----+----+-----+------+\r\n\r\n  --------------+-----+------------------------------------------------\r\n  October, 1912.|     |        Main Line, Upper Bari Doab Canal.\r\n                |     +------------+-----------------------------------\r\n                |     |   Kunjar   |           Aliwal Regulator\r\n                |     +------------+-----+---------+---------+---------\r\n                |     |    Kaler   |Above|Amritsar | Lahore  |Escape\r\n                |     |Distributary|     | Branch  | Branch  |\r\n                |     +------+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n                |Date.| _G._ | _D._| _G._|_G._|_D._|_G._|_D._|_G._|_D._\r\n                |     |------+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n                |     |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n                |     |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n                |   1 |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n                |   2 |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n                |   3 |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n                |  *  |  *   |  *  |  *  | *  | *  | *  | *  | *  | *\r\n                |  29 |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n                |  30 |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n                |  31 |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  --------------+-----+------+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n    Total             |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  --------------------+------+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n  No. of days in flow |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  --------------------+------+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n    Average           |      |     |     |    |    |    |    |    |\r\n  --------------------+------+-----+-----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n\r\nAs regards the weekly indents, the dealing with discharges instead of\r\ngauge readings is of little practical value. The zilladar merely knows\r\nthat on some outlets the demand is great, on others moderate, and he\r\njudges that the distributary needs say, 4 feet of water, its full supply\r\ngauge being 5 feet. He cannot tell how many cubic feet each outlet\r\nrequires. If he is required to indent in cubic feet per second (he is\r\nnot always required to do this) he probably gets at the discharge from\r\nthe gauge reading, and not the gauge reading from the discharge. As\r\nregards the general indent made by the Subdivisional Officer, the same\r\nremarks apply. He can probably tell what gauge he requires without going\r\ninto discharges.\r\n\r\nRegarding the working out of delta month by month, not only are\r\ndischarges more or less doubtful, but the area irrigated is seldom\r\ncorrect till near the end of the crop. However, the figures, towards the\r\nend of a crop, may be useful. If delta on any distributary is higher\r\nthan is usual on that distributary, it may be desirable, if the supply\r\nin the whole canal is short, to reduce the supply to that distributary\r\nsomewhat, but this remedy can be properly applied after the end of the\r\ncrop by altering the turns (Art. 5). Any steps in the direction of\r\naltering outlets can only be taken after the end of the crop. Admitting,\r\nhowever, that the working out of delta during the crop is useful, it can\r\nbe done by adding up the gauge readings for the month and taking the\r\naverage reading and the discharge corresponding to it. This is not quite\r\nthe same as the average of the daily discharges, but the difference is\r\nsmall, and there would be a wholesale and most salutary saving in\r\nclerical work. All the columns headed D could be omitted. The handiness\r\nand compactness of the register would be vastly increased. The\r\ndischarges are only approximately known, and refinements of procedure\r\nare unnecessary. The correction of the discharge table, by means of\r\nobserved discharges, once a month, can of course be effected without\r\nbooking the daily discharges.[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] There should, in any case, be a special place in the gauge\r\n  register for showing the discharge tables, with a note of the\r\n  discharge observations from which the table was framed or in\r\n  consequence of which it was altered.\r\n\r\nSupposing the columns D to be retained the calculations of delta can be\r\nmade as shown in table II. the form being printed in the gauge book. To\r\nfacilitate the adding up of the discharges a line can be left blank in\r\ntable I. after each ten days, and the total for the ten days shown on\r\nit. If the column D is not retained, the gauge readings can be added up.\r\nThe discharge corresponding to the mean gauge reading of the month,\r\nmultiplied by the number of days the distributary was in flow, gives the\r\nfigure to be entered in column 2 of table II.\r\n\r\nThe final working out of delta crop by crop is of course of the greatest\r\nvalue. The point which needs attention is, as already remarked, greater\r\naccuracy in the discharges. For reasons which have already been given\r\n(CHAP. I., Art. 5, and CHAP. II., Art. 9) the values of delta on\r\ndifferent distributaries will never be the same, but the causes of high\r\nvalues can always be investigated and, to some extent, remedied.\r\n\r\nTABLE II.--CALCULATION OF DELTA FOR RABI, 1912-13, NANGAL DISTRIBUTARY.\r\n\r\n  ------+------------+------------+---------+------+------------------\r\n  Month.|  Total of  | No. of days|Irrigated| Delta|     Remarks.\r\n        | discharges |  in flow.  | area up | up to|\r\n        +------+-----+------+-----+ to date.| date.|\r\n        | For  |Up to| For  |Up to|         |      |\r\n        |month.|date.|month.|date.|         |      |\r\n  ------+------+-----+------+-----+---------+------+------------------\r\n        |      |     |      |     |  Acres  | Feet |\r\n  Octo- | 3255 | 3255|  31  | 31  |   6510  | 1·0  |\r\n  ber   |      |     |      |     |         |      |\r\n        |      |     |      |     |         |      |\r\n  Novem-| 3390 | 6345|  27  | 58  |   9000  | 1·41 |Closed 3 days\r\n  ber   |      |     |      |     |         |      |because of breach.\r\n  ------+------+-----+------+-----+---------+------+------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n4. =Registers of Irrigation and Outlets.= It is obvious that a\r\nSubdivisional Officer cannot look properly into matters connected with\r\nthe working of his channels unless he has, ready to hand, a register\r\nshowing, crop by crop, the area irrigated by each distributary and each\r\noutlet and keeps it posted up to date. In 1888 the Chief Engineer of the\r\nPunjab Irrigation directed that each Subdivisional Officer should keep\r\nup English registers of irrigation by villages. The order was for years\r\nlost sight of. The matter has lately, in view of certain recent\r\noccurrences on a large perennial canal, again come to notice, and this\r\nmost essential factor in the working of a canal is, it is believed,\r\nreceiving attention.\r\n\r\nAs to the precise form which an irrigation register should take,\r\nopinions and practices differ somewhat. In all cases the net irrigated\r\nareas should be shown--kharif, rabi, and total--and the total remitted\r\narea. The areas remitted for kharif and rabi separately may or may not\r\nbe shown. The net percentage of the commanded culturable area\r\nirrigated--total of the two crops--can be shown in red ink and is most\r\nuseful.[28] It enables the general state of affairs on any outlet to be\r\nseen at a glance and shows how it compares with other outlets and with\r\nthe whole distributary.\r\n\r\n  [28] Provided that the culturable commanded area is properly shown and\r\n  is not made to include jungles or other tracts which were never\r\n  intended to be irrigated.\r\n\r\nBesides the irrigation figures it is necessary to record for each outlet\r\nits chainage, size of barrel[29] and commanded culturable area. In the\r\ncase of a distributary which has been working for years, and on which\r\nthe outlets are undergoing few alterations, it may be suitable to record\r\nthe above items in a separate “outlet register,” and to give in the\r\nirrigation register a reference to the page of the outlet register. But\r\neven in such a case alterations will have to be made from time to time\r\nin the outlet register and there is great danger of its becoming spoilt,\r\nimperfect or unintelligible. In the case of a distributary on which the\r\noutlets are undergoing frequent changes, the items under consideration\r\nshould be shown crop by crop, and also the material of the outlet--wood\r\nor masonry--and the width and mean height of the barrel. In no other way\r\ncan the working of the outlet be properly followed and understood. It is\r\nprobable that this procedure is the best in every case, _i.e._, even\r\nwhen the alterations made are not frequent. By arranging the register as\r\nshown in table III. the repetition of the entries, when they undergo no\r\nalteration, is avoided, only dots having to be made.\r\n\r\n  [29] The sizes of the outlets should be measured by the suboverseer\r\n  and some checked by the Subdivisional Officer and the correct\r\n  sectional area, as actually built, entered.\r\n\r\nThe specimen shows only two outlets on a page, and covers five years,\r\nbut three outlets can easily be shown on a large page, and the period\r\ncan be seven years. If there are more than three outlets in the village,\r\nthe lowest part of the page shows the total of the page instead of the\r\ntotal of the village, and the other outlets are shown on the next page,\r\nthe grand total for the village coming at the foot.\r\n\r\nTABLE III.--REGISTER BY OUTLETS AND VILLAGES.\r\n\r\n          Distributary ..................................\r\n

downstream of, and bear\r\nserial numbers lower than, the outlets of the next village. When one\r\noutlet irrigates two or three villages the irrigation of the separate\r\nvillages can be entered on one page in the places usually allotted to\r\noutlets, and the lowest part of the page can show the total for the\r\noutlet, the necessary changes in the headings, etc. being made. If any\r\nof the villages has other outlets these will appear on another page and\r\nthe total for the village can also be shown.\r\n\r\nThe village totals should be posted into a second register prepared\r\nsomewhat as shown in table IV. and totalled. The totals show the\r\nirrigation for the whole distributary.[30] If necessary the failed areas\r\ncan be shown in the register in red ink. If any village is irrigated\r\nfrom two or more distributaries, each portion of the village should be\r\ndealt with as if it was a separate village.\r\n\r\n  [30] Very long channels, e.g. inundation canals from which direct\r\n  irrigation takes place, can be divided into reaches and the irrigation\r\n  of the reaches dealt with as if they were separate channels. A reach\r\n  should generally end at a bifurcation or stopdam.\r\n\r\nIn all registers some blank spaces should be left for the insertion of\r\nnew outlets or new villages. The number of pages to be left will depend\r\non local circumstances, which should be considered. In case figures are\r\nsupplied by the revenue authorities and deal only with whole villages,\r\nthe details obtained by the canal staff should always be added up and\r\nchecked with them. Similarly the commanded culturable areas for the\r\noutlets and villages should be added up and checked with the known total\r\nfor the distributary.\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.--ABSTRACT OF IRRIGATION BY VILLAGES AND CHANNELS.\r\n\r\n  Canal......................

Any\r\nspecial causes of low percentages, e.g. a large proportion of rice, can\r\nbe briefly noted in the register.\r\n\r\nOn inundation canals, and some others, the alignment and chainage are\r\nliable to undergo alteration. In such cases it is best to adhere to the\r\noriginal chainage until all the alterations in alignment have been\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. =Distribution of Supply.= The question how the supply of a canal is\r\nto be distributed when it is less than the demand, is not always very\r\nsimple. Suppose that the main canal, after perhaps giving off several\r\ndistributaries, divides, at one place, into three branches, A, B, and C,\r\nwhose full supply discharges are respectively 2,500, 2,000 and 1,500 c.\r\nft. per second. Suppose that the total discharge reaching the\r\ntrifurcation is expected to be, when at the lowest during the crop, only\r\n2,200 c. ft. per second, instead of 6,000. It would be possible,\r\nsupposing the discharge tables to be fairly accurate, to keep all the\r\nchannels running with discharges proportionate to their full supplies,\r\nbut this would not be suitable. The water levels would not be high\r\nenough to enable full supplies to be got into the distributaries, or at\r\nleast into some of them. Moreover, the running of low supplies causes\r\nmuch loss by absorption. The plan usually adopted is to give each\r\nchannel full supply, or nearly full supply, in turn, and for such a\r\nnumber of days that the turn of each branch will recur about once a\r\nfortnight, that being a suitable period having regard to the exigencies\r\nof crops, and having the advantage that the turn of each branch comes on\r\na particular day of the week, so that everyone concerned, and\r\nespecially the irrigating community, can remember and understand it.\r\nTable V. shows how the turns in the above case can be arranged. The\r\nfigures show the discharges.\r\n\r\nTABLE V.\r\n\r\n  ---------+------+------+------\r\n    DAY.   |   A  |   B  |   C\r\n  ---------+------+------+------\r\n     1     | 2,200|      |\r\n     2     | 2,200|      |\r\n     3     | 2,200|      |\r\n     4     | 2,200|      |\r\n     5     | 2,200|      |\r\n     6     |      | 2,000|   200\r\n     7     |      | 2,000|   200\r\n     8     |      | 2,000|   200\r\n     9     |      | 2,000|   200\r\n    10     |      | 2,000|   200\r\n    11     |   700|      | 1,500\r\n    12     |   700|      | 1,500\r\n    13     |   700|      | 1,500\r\n    14     |   700|      | 1,500\r\n  ---------+------+------+------\r\n   Total   |13,800|10,000| 7,000\r\n           |      |      |\r\n  Correct  |      |      |\r\n  discharge|12,800|10,300| 7,700\r\n  according|      |      |\r\n  to Full  |      |      |\r\n  Supply.  |      |      |\r\n  ---------+------+------+------\r\n\r\nThe orders given to the gauge readers in these cases are simple, namely\r\nto give each branch full supply in turn, and to send the rest of the\r\nwater down the channel next on the list.\r\n\r\nThe number of days allotted to the larger branches are greater than to\r\nthe smallest because this will probably be simplest in the end, and also\r\nbecause the number of distributaries on a larger branch is likely to be\r\ngreater, and the allotment to the distributaries is thus facilitated\r\nsomewhat. Each branch receives water in one period of consecutive days.\r\nAny splitting up of the turn would be highly objectionable. It would\r\ncause waste of water, and would give rise to much difficulty in\r\nredistributing the supply among its distributaries. Each branch receives\r\nits residuum turn before it receives its full supply turn. The advantage\r\nof this is that water is not let into the channel suddenly. The total\r\nsupplies of A, B and C are in the ratio of 13·8, 10, and 7, and not, as\r\nthey should be 12·8, 10·3, and 7·7, but no closer approximation can be\r\ngot. If the number of days of full supply allotted to each branch is\r\nchanged, or if the residuum from C is given to B, instead of A, the\r\nrelative total discharges differ still more from what they should be.\r\n\r\nIf now the total supply is supposed to be increased to 2,700 c. ft. per\r\nsecond, the discharges are as shown in table VI.\r\n\r\nTABLE VI.\r\n\r\n  ----------+-------+-------+-----\r\n     DAY.   |   A   |    B  |  C\r\n  ----------+-------+-------+-----\r\n       1    | 2,500 |   200 |\r\n       2    | 2,500 |   200 |\r\n       3    | 2,500 |   200 |\r\n       4    | 2,500 |   200 |\r\n       5    | 2,500 |   200 |\r\n       6    |       | 2,000 |  700\r\n       7    |       | 2,000 |  700\r\n       8    |       | 2,000 |  700\r\n       9    |       | 2,000 |  700\r\n      10    |       | 2,000 |  700\r\n      11    | 1,200 |       |1,500\r\n      12    | 1,200 |       |1,500\r\n      13    | 1,200 |       |1,500\r\n      14    | 1,200 |       |1,500\r\n  ----------+-------+-------+-----\r\n    Total   |17,300 |11,000 |9,500\r\n            |       |       |\r\n  Correct   |       |       |\r\n  Discharge.|15,700 |12,600 |9,500\r\n  ----------+-------+-------+-----\r\n\r\nConsidering both the above tables, A always receives more water than its\r\nshare, while B and C on the whole receive too little. Considering table\r\nV. by itself, matters might, perhaps, be set right by altering the total\r\nnumber of days from 14 to 13 or 12, but this, besides being somewhat\r\nobjectionable for the reason already given, might not improve matters\r\nwhen table VI. came into operation. It is desirable to avoid frequent\r\nchanges or complicated rules. It is objectionable to make any turn\r\nconsist of other than a whole number of days. The shifting of the\r\nregulator gates is begun at sunrise, a time when officials are about and\r\ncan see what is happening. All gauges are read early in the morning, and\r\nthose at regulators are read after the regulation has been done and the\r\nflow has become steady. If any regulation were done in the evening, the\r\nentry in the gauge register of that day would convey a wrong impression,\r\nand the discharge would be incorrectly booked. Moreover, any system of\r\nregularly booking evening as well as morning gauges leads to swelling of\r\nthe already voluminous gauge register.\r\n\r\nThe best method of adjusting matters is to make slight alterations in\r\nthe full supply gauges. Suppose the normal full supplies in all three\r\nbranches to be 6 feet. When table VI. is in operation the full supply of\r\nA can be reduced to about 5·8 feet. This would give, during the first 5\r\ndays, less water to A and more to B, and there is the further advantage\r\nthat a very small supply, 200 c. ft. per second, is not run in any\r\nbranch. As regards table V., branch A never receives full supply. This\r\nis a rare case.[31] If it were safe, as it might be, to run slightly\r\nmore than full supply in C, this could be done, and it would increase\r\nthe supply in C during the last four days and reduce that in A.\r\nOtherwise a certain gauge would have to be fixed for A which would give\r\nit less than 2,200 c. ft. per second during the first 5 days, and the\r\nbalance would go to branch B. Similarly, the gauge of B could be\r\nslightly reduced, and this would increase the balance going to C. The\r\norders given to the gauge reader are, as before, to send the full supply\r\ndown one channel, and the balance to the next. The only additional\r\nprocedure necessary is to inform the gauge reader from time to time what\r\nthe full supply gauges are. In any case such information has probably to\r\nbe conveyed to him at times because the channels undergo changes, and\r\nthe discharge corresponding to a given gauge also changes.\r\n\r\n  [31] The total discharge, 2,200 c. ft. per second, assumed, is very\r\n  low compared with the full supply of 6,000 c. ft. per second.\r\n\r\nWhen the discharge of the canal exceeds 3,500 c. ft. per second there\r\nis, when B and C are receiving water, a second residuum, which goes to\r\nA. Tables can be worked out for several discharges of the main canal,\r\nbut it is the minimum discharge which is the most important factor in\r\nthe case. The minimum discharge, or something very near it, generally\r\nlasts through about half the crop, and it is when the supply is at a\r\nminimum that care and justice in the distribution are most needed.\r\n\r\nThe chief objection to the arrangements above described is that the\r\nsurplus to be sent down one channel or another is sometimes so small\r\nthat it must be to a great extent wasted. The best means of preventing\r\nthis is to have the discharge tables, including one for the main canal\r\nat some point higher up than the trifurcation, constantly corrected. In\r\nthat case, it is known under what circumstances a small surplus will\r\noccur, and the orders can be modified so as to prevent its occurrence.\r\nThe orders will of course be more complicated, and will have to be dealt\r\nwith by an engineer and not a gauge reader.\r\n\r\nThe turns, once satisfactorily arranged, may go on for years without\r\nalteration. They may require altering if any branch is found, in the\r\ncourse of time, to be doing worse than or better than the others, though\r\nthe correction can probably be made by altering the full supply gauge.\r\n\r\nThe turns of the branches having been arranged, it remains to settle\r\nthose of the distributaries. The total available discharge being, as\r\nbefore, assumed to be rather more than one-third of the full supply\r\ndischarge, each distributary taking off from the main canal, where it is\r\nnot possible or not desirable to regulate the height of the water level\r\nin the canal, can be run with full supply for four or five days out of\r\neach fortnight, and then closed. Whether it be four days or five may\r\noften depend on special circumstances such as whether the distributary\r\nis doing well or otherwise. If necessary the full supply can be\r\nadjusted. When the canal supply increases the four or five days can be\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\nThe same principle can be adopted for any distributary whose off-take is\r\nin the upper part of a branch, _i.e._, where the branch is many times\r\nlarger than the distributary, and where it is not possible or not\r\ndesirable to regulate the water level of the branch. For a distributary\r\nfurther down the branch, the turns of branch and distributary can be\r\narranged as explained above for a canal bifurcation. The orders given to\r\nthe gauge reader are, as before, to give the channel whose turn it is,\r\nfull supply and to send the balance down the other channel. When the\r\nturn of distributary is over it becomes the turn of the branch. The\r\ndistributary would not be closed if this would cause the full supply in\r\nthe branch to be exceeded. Care must be taken that every distributary\r\nreceives full supply during part of the time when the branch is\r\nreceiving full supply. If its turn came only when the branch was\r\nreceiving a residuum supply, or rather when the residuum supply was\r\nreaching the distributary off-take--for in the case of a distributary\r\nwhose off-take is far down a long branch the two things are not the\r\nsame--it might, in the event of the supply in the main canal falling\r\nexceptionally low, receive no water at all.\r\n\r\nThe time taken by a rise in travelling down a canal is very much the\r\nsame as that taken by a fall and each takes effect more or less\r\ngradually. When a branch receives, at any point, a temporary increase in\r\nits supply, owing to the closure of a distributary for, say, three\r\ndays, there will be a rise lasting for three days at a point further\r\ndown. The rise will take some time to come to its height, and some time\r\nto die away. There will be about three days from the commencement of the\r\nrise to the commencement of the fall, or from the end of the rise to the\r\nend of the fall. If, either in the main canal or in a branch, there is\r\nany distributary into which full supply cannot be got, its turn can be\r\nincreased accordingly. Owing to the shortness of the turns, and to\r\nallowance having to be made for the time occupied by rises and falls in\r\ntravelling down the branch, the fixing of the turns for distributaries\r\nnear the tail of the branch requires a good deal of consideration.\r\nMatters are facilitated by making a sketch (Fig. 25) in which the widths\r\nof the channels, as drawn, are roughly in proportion to the full supply\r\ndischarges. If 14 copies of the sketch are made the arrangements for\r\neach day can be shown on them, full supply being shown black and\r\nresiduum hatched. Distributaries would be shown as well as the main\r\nchannels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nThe irrigation registers of course show how the irrigation of the\r\ndifferent channels is going on from year to year and if changes in the\r\nturns become necessary they can be effected.\r\n\r\nAfter the water has entered the watercourses the canal officials have\r\nnothing to do with its distribution. The people arrange among\r\nthemselves a system of turns, each person taking the water for a certain\r\nnumber of “pahars”--a pahar is a watch of three hours--or fractions of a\r\npahar. The zilladar can however be called in by any person who has a\r\ndispute with his neighbour. If the matter is not settled the person\r\naggrieved can lodge a formal complaint and a canal officer then tries\r\nthe case, and if necessary punishes the offender.\r\n\r\nIn former days it was usual, in some places, for no regular turns to be\r\nfixed for the distributaries, orders being issued regarding them from\r\ntime to time. The weak point about any such plan is that in the event of\r\nthe controlling officer delaying, owing to any accident, to issue an\r\norder, no one knows what to do. Orders were also sometimes issued to\r\nzilladars giving them discretionary powers in distribution. No one would\r\nnow issue such orders. The essential principle is to remove power from\r\nthe hands of the subordinates. The working of the main channels by turns\r\nand the construction of outlets of such a size that they never require\r\nclosure, has resulted--in places where such matters are attended to--in\r\nthe absolute destruction of such power.[32] The only way in which a\r\nzilladar can injure anyone is to say that water is not in demand. This\r\nwould however result in damaging the whole of the villages in his\r\ncharge. He is not likely to do this.\r\n\r\n  [32] In the printed form lately in use in the Punjab for reports on\r\n  zilladars, one of the questions asked is whether “his arrangements”\r\n  for the distribution of water are satisfactory, as if that was still\r\n  considered to be the zilladar’s business.\r\n\r\nIn case the supply is wholly or partially interrupted owing to a breach\r\nor an accident at the headworks, or other cause, one particular branch\r\nor distributary may lose its turn or part of it. If its loss is not\r\ngreat it may be best to allow the turns to take their usual course, but\r\notherwise they should be temporarily altered in such a way as to\r\ncompensate the channels which have suffered.\r\n\r\nOn inundation canals the water at a regulator is sometimes headed\r\nup,--all branches being partially closed--in order to give more water to\r\noutlets in the upstream reach. There are even some regulators--or rather\r\nstop-dams--constructed solely for this purpose at places where there is\r\nno bifurcation of the canal or distributary. Any such heading up should\r\nbe planned out beforehand and days for it fixed, and also the gauge\r\nreading. If the water, without any heading up, rises to the needful\r\nheight on the gauge, nothing has to be done. There are also places on\r\ninundation canals where the land is high and is only irrigable during\r\nfloods. At such places it is usual, on some canals, to allow the people\r\nto make cuts in the bank when the water attains a certain height. Owing\r\nto the high level of the country, nothing in the nature of a breach can\r\noccur. In one canal division where the above arrangement was in force,\r\nthe people used to send applications to the Executive Engineer for leave\r\nto cut the banks. This resulted in much delay. A list was prepared\r\nshowing exactly where the banks might be cut, the people were informed\r\nand the formalities were much reduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. =Extensions and Remodellings.= An existing canal or distributary may\r\nneed remodelling for various reasons, and in various degrees. If the\r\nvelocity is too high and the bed has scoured, or the sides have fallen\r\nin, it may be necessary to raise the crests of falls, or to construct\r\nintermediate weirs, or to widen the channel and reduce the depth. If the\r\ncommand is not good it may be necessary to regrade the channel. If silt\r\ndeposit occurs, the cross-section of the channel may have to be altered,\r\nto give a better relation between D and V. If there is surplus water,\r\nextensions or enlargements of channels may be desirable and these can\r\nsometimes be undertaken to a moderate extent merely by restricting a\r\nsomewhat too lavish supply to existing distributaries. If the water\r\nlevel is dangerously high it may have to be lowered, or the banks raised\r\nand strengthened. Sometimes it is desirable to cut off bends either to\r\nshorten the channel and gain command or because the bends are sharp and\r\ncause falling in of the banks or, if numerous, silting. In all cases the\r\ngeneral principles are the same as for entirely new projects, but\r\ncertain details require consideration.\r\n\r\nThe distributaries of the older canals were constructed before Kennedy’s\r\nlaws regarding silting were known, and it has been necessary to remodel\r\nmany of them. In some cases the gradient was wrong, in others the\r\ncross-section.[33] In some cases a distributary ran in rather low\r\nground, and it was proposed to abandon it and construct a new one on\r\nhigh ground. It was however pointed out by Kennedy (_Punjab Irrigation\r\nPaper No. 10_, “Remodelling of Distributaries on old Canals,”) that\r\nirrigation had become established along the course of the distributary,\r\nthat most of it would remain there and that a new alignment would result\r\nin increased length of watercourses. Such distributaries have therefore\r\nbeen allowed to remain very much as they were.\r\n\r\n  [33] The difficulty of reducing the size of a channel which is too\r\n  large is well known and has been discussed in _River and Canal\r\n  Engineering_, Chapter VIII. It is there explained that a moderate\r\n  reduction of width can be effected by “bushing,” but that for great\r\n  reductions, groynes or training walls are necessary. When the bed of a\r\n  distributary is too low it has been suggested that it could be raised\r\n  by filling in earth in each alternate length of 500 feet, and leaving\r\n  the rest to silt, but this would be expensive.\r\n\r\nRemodelling should not be considered piecemeal, but regard should be had\r\nto the whole channel. When a distributary is remodelled the outlets\r\nshould of course be dealt with as well as the channel. The chief thing\r\nto consider is not whether the channel as it exists is exactly as it was\r\noriginally designed to be, but how it is doing its work and what kind of\r\nalteration it needs. Even when a simple silt clearance or berm cutting\r\nof a channel has to be undertaken, the work need not always consist in\r\nblindly restoring the channel to its original condition. It may be both\r\nfeasible and desirable to remodel it to a slight extent, lowering the\r\nwater for instance in reaches where the outlets draw off very good\r\nsupplies and thus benefiting less fortunate reaches lower down.\r\n\r\nThe irrigation boundaries of the extended or remodelled channel should\r\nas far as possible follow drainages, but these are not always important\r\nor pronounced. The actual irrigation boundaries should be shown and also\r\nthose of any neighbouring channels of other canals, and any suitable\r\nadjustments should be made.\r\n\r\nRegarding the percentage of area to be irrigated, it has already been\r\nstated that one canal or distributary irrigates a far higher percentage\r\nthan another. Generally when there is a high percentage in any tract, it\r\nis undesirable to cut it down unless it has very recently sprung up to\r\nthe detriment of other tracts. In some remodelling projects a uniform\r\npercentage is taken on the whole area including both new and old\r\nirrigation. This plan is suitable when the percentage of old irrigation\r\nis not very high. In other cases the old irrigation to be provided for\r\nmay be taken as the maximum area actually irrigated, a little being\r\nperhaps added for extensions. If the irrigation of considerable areas of\r\njungle tracts is contemplated and if these consist of numerous small\r\npatches, a further percentage can be added for them. If there are large\r\njungle tracts they can of course be dealt with separately and any\r\nsuitable percentage adopted for them. The percentage for each portion of\r\na remodelling project is not necessarily the same.\r\n\r\nIf the discharge of a channel is increased, the waterways of bridges may\r\nneed increasing. This can often be done (Chapter II., Art. 12) by making\r\na floor at a low level. Or the waterway may be allowed to remain small,\r\nthe floor being added at the bed level and the bridge then becoming an\r\nincomplete fall, (page 87). The fall in the water surface, though small,\r\ncan be recognised and shown on the longitudinal section.\r\n\r\nIn remodelling schemes, the longitudinal section should give all\r\npossible information. It should show not only the levels of bed and\r\nbanks, but the F.S. levels (in blue figures) above and below all falls\r\nor regulators, and the levels of floors and waterways of bridges. The\r\nplan should show all watercourses and the “chaks” or areas assigned to\r\nthem.[34] On each chak the actual average irrigation can be shown in\r\nblue figures and the proposed irrigation in red. The “draw-off” for each\r\nproposed outlet can then be shown on the longitudinal section. The area\r\nactually irrigated, as shown on the map, should in each case be the\r\nmean of at least three years, and if possible of five years. The number\r\nof years should be mentioned in a note on the map. Cross-sections of\r\nchannels should always be drawn to natural scale, and not with the\r\nhorizontal scale differing from the vertical.\r\n\r\n  [34] The field maps mentioned on page 101 are prepared to a very large\r\n  scale and show all watercourses. The maps should always be corrected\r\n  up to date by the patwaris. The chak maps which are on a smaller\r\n  scale--say 4 inches to the mile--can thus be kept correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. =Remodelling of outlets.= When a channel is remodelled, the\r\nremodelling of the outlets may consist in alterations of the number or\r\nsites or in alterations of their sizes.\r\n\r\nRegarding the former, a map should be prepared showing all watercourses,\r\nchaks and contours.[35] On this map new lines for the watercourses can\r\nbe shown, the principles enunciated in Chapter II., Art. 9, being\r\ngenerally followed, but in such a way as to utilise existing\r\nwatercourses and outlets as far as possible. The work often consists in\r\nthe abolition of a certain number of watercourses, when these are too\r\nclose together and run parallel to one another. There may, however, be\r\nlittle gain in amalgamating two such watercourses if they serve two\r\ndifferent villages. There is nothing to prevent the people from dividing\r\nthe watercourse into two as soon as it gets away from the canal, and\r\nthey are likely to do this in many cases. When one branch has a flatter\r\nslope than the other it would lose command if it took off further down.\r\nThe people on the steeper branch might not agree to using the flatter\r\none because of silt trouble, or increased height of embankment. In a new\r\nproject it is not difficult to get the people to do what is needed, but\r\nwhen once irrigation has become established it is often difficult to get\r\nsuitable changes made. The advantages of amalgamating watercourses,\r\nthough appreciable, have been a good deal exaggerated. The chief\r\nadvantage is gained by reduction in the sizes of outlets. Then, however\r\nmany branches the watercourse may have, they can only run in turns and\r\nnot all together. It may happen that two watercourses, though taking off\r\nnear one another, run in different directions and that the chaks are of\r\nsuitable shapes and sizes. In such a case the only advantage of\r\namalgamating is that it saves an outlet in the canal bank. No saving in\r\nthe length of watercourse will be effected because there will be a\r\nbifurcation as soon as the watercourse leaves the canal boundary. If\r\nboth outlets are of suitable design and proper size or require only\r\nslight alteration, both can remain but otherwise amalgamation can be\r\neffected. In some cases amalgamation might give a discharge greater than\r\nthat usually allowed for an outlet but this need form no obstacle. The\r\nchief reason for limiting the discharge is the alleged inability of the\r\nfarmers to manage a large channel. This matter is exaggerated as already\r\nstated (page 74). In the case under consideration it obviously makes no\r\ndifference whether there are two watercourses each discharging 5 c. ft.\r\nper second, or one discharging 10 c. ft. per second, and immediately\r\ndividing into two. Very small watercourses should, when possible, be\r\njoined to others but if there is no other near enough they must\r\ngenerally remain, however small they may be.\r\n\r\n  [35] In small remodelling schemes the lines of existing watercourses\r\n  show how the country slopes, and a contour plan is not a necessity.\r\n\r\nRegarding the alterations in sizes of outlets, whether or not there are\r\nalterations in their number and position, information as to the actual\r\nduties on the watercourses should be obtained. The discharge of the\r\nwatercourses should be observed several times and added up and checked\r\nwith the discharge of the distributary. The areas irrigated are known\r\nfrom the irrigation register. If the duties are abnormal the causes can\r\nbe gone into, and a judgement can be formed as to how far they will\r\nremain in existence, and whether any watercourse is often kept closed.\r\nIf so the outlet is too large. The duties, modified so far as may seem\r\ndesirable, can be used for calculating the sizes of the remodelled\r\noutlets. But alterations of the sizes after a year or two years’ working\r\nwill probably be necessary. The above procedure is also applicable to a\r\ncase where the old watercourses had no masonry heads but were merely\r\nopen cuts as on some inundation canals.\r\n\r\nA common case is that in which the channel is not remodelled--or at\r\nleast its water level remains very much as before--but merely the\r\noutlets are altered in number, position or size, or in any or all of\r\nthese. If the land irrigated by an outlet is high, the irrigation may be\r\nfar short of what was expected, and the size of the outlet may have to\r\nbe increased or its site shifted, generally upstream. This is often done\r\nat the request of the people, and at their expense.[36]\r\n\r\n  [36] On some of the more modern canals the people are not allowed to\r\n  pay for outlets, so that no question of ownership can arise.\r\n\r\nOld outlets should always be removed when superseded by others.\r\nOtherwise they are apt to be reopened or claims set up regarding them.\r\n\r\nNear the tail of a channel the discharge of an outlet may be an\r\nappreciable fraction of that of the channel. In such a case the\r\nadjustment of the size of the outlet, and that of the channel or of any\r\nweir or fall in the channel, should be considered together, the\r\nirrigation on the outlet and that on the channel downstream of it being\r\ncompared. And similarly as to the sizes of any two or more tail outlets.\r\nSuch outlets are sometimes left without masonry heads on the ground that\r\nthis injures no one. It may injure an outlet upstream of them by drawing\r\ndown the water. Tail outlets often need constructing or reducing in size\r\nto raise the water level in the reach upstream of them.\r\n\r\nWhenever the size of an old outlet is altered the design should be\r\naltered if unsuitable. The parapets should be brought into proper line,\r\nthe roadway corrected, the floor level adjusted and any splayed wing\r\nwalls abolished. If the outlet is skew it should be made square. All\r\nthis should also be done to all old outlets or heads of minors even if\r\nthe sizes are correct, whenever remodelling of outlets on any channel is\r\nundertaken.[37]\r\n\r\n  [37] Wherever an outlet is built or altered, a template, made to the\r\n  exact size of barrel required, should be supplied to the subordinate\r\n  in charge of the work.\r\n\r\nIt was stated in Chapter II. that the construction of masonry outlets on\r\na distributary is not usually a final settlement of the matter. In many\r\ncases a proper proportion of water does not reach the tail. Even in such\r\na case matters have occasionally been left alone, or the old and\r\npernicious system of closing the upper outlets has been resorted to. In\r\nsuch circumstances the irrigation of a group of tail villages will be\r\nfound to be less than that of a group higher up, the people to some\r\nextent acquiescing in the old idea that a tail village must be a\r\nsufferer. Government, or at least the Irrigation Department, has no\r\nparticular direct interest in the matter. The total area irrigated, will\r\nprobably be very much the same in any case. But an engineer who takes an\r\ninterest in this part of his work will not allow matters to remain long\r\nin the state described. He will, of his own accord, adjust the outlets\r\nand equalise, as far as possible, the irrigated percentages. The people\r\nwill disturb matters to some extent by enlarging watercourses, but there\r\nis a limit to this and it can be met by an occasional reduction of an\r\noutlet. A distributary, when once its outlets have been carefully\r\nadjusted, attains to something approaching perfection in its working.\r\nAny excess in the supply is taken partly by the upper outlets but part\r\nof it gets to the tail. Similarly any deficiency in the supply is\r\ndistributed over the channel. The outlets which have a poor command and\r\nsmall head are most affected in either case. On the whole they do not\r\nlose or gain more than the others. The working of such a distributary\r\ncauses great satisfaction to the engineer and not the least ingredient\r\nin this is the knowledge that he has wholly destroyed the power of his\r\nnative subordinate.\r\n\r\nIn an inundation canal division in the Punjab, some dozen\r\ndistributaries, varying in length from 5 to 28 miles, and with\r\ndischarges ranging up to 300 c. feet per second, were dealt with as\r\nabove in one season. The engineer in charge being specially desirous\r\nthat sufficient water should reach the tails, reduced the sizes of some\r\noutlets too much. When an outlet of 1 or 2 sq. feet has to be reduced to\r\na small fraction of its size it is not easy to say what the fraction\r\nshall be. Water reached the tails of all the channels in sufficient\r\nquantity, in some cases in rather more quantity than was necessary.\r\nWhen the irrigation register was examined, it was found that the general\r\nresults were entirely satisfactory. In a small proportion of cases\r\noutlets had irrigated too little and had to be re-enlarged somewhat.\r\nAfter a second season hardly any changes were needed. When any silt\r\nclearance or berm-cutting seemed necessary the irrigation register again\r\ncame into play. If, for instance the tail outlets, as a whole, were\r\nreceiving too little water, enlargement of the upstream reaches was\r\neffected with consequent lowering of the water level there.\r\n\r\nIn the case above described the channels flowed for only five months in\r\nthe year. Some of them silted a good deal but as this silting was\r\nroughly the same every year, it did not greatly affect the question of\r\noutlet sizes. On a perennial distributary of which the head reach silts\r\nduring part of the year and scours during the other part, a proper\r\ndistribution of supply by adjustment of outlet sizes alone may be more\r\ndifficult. If the silt was frequently cleared, this would cause needless\r\nexpense and interference with irrigation. In cases where the\r\ndistributary is not run constantly, something can be done by attending\r\nto the regulation. When there is silt in the head reach, the discharge\r\ncan be reduced and the period of flow proportionately increased. The\r\nlowered water level reduces the supplies of the upper outlets, and\r\nincreases the discharges of those lower down. Moreover the periodical\r\nsilting and scour are not always serious. Also it is not essential that\r\nthe supply to each watercourse should be exactly the same every year.\r\nThere are always good and bad seasons. It is sufficient if a watercourse\r\nis not allowed to suffer on the whole, and is never allowed to suffer\r\nmuch. There is no doubt that it is possible to deal satisfactorily in\r\nthe above manner with very many distributaries. It is frequently\r\nreported that “difficulty is experienced in getting water to the tail.”\r\nThis is owing to timidity in reducing the sizes of outlets. The suitable\r\nplan is to reduce them to such an extent as to cause a proper supply to\r\nreach the tail and then, if necessary to enlarge some. It has been\r\nalready remarked that only a short length of the barrel need be altered.\r\nThe cost of this is very small. The real difficulty in the case is not\r\nthe impossibility of securing good results, but the impracticability, in\r\nmany cases, of securing the constant attention which the procedure\r\ndemands.[38]\r\n\r\n  [38] See also Chapter V. Art 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. =Miscellaneous Items.= At the headworks of a canal there is a\r\npermanent staff of men who work the gates and look after the works. They\r\nassist in discharge observations and in reading the gauges, and they may\r\nhave to take soundings in the river to see what changes are taking\r\nplace. Some one is on watch day and night and reads the gauges at\r\nfrequent intervals. The officer in charge occasionally inspects the\r\nworks at night without notice. Detailed rules regarding the above\r\nmatters, and any others that are necessary owing to special local\r\nconditions, are drawn up. Sometimes there is difficulty in getting the\r\nstaff to attend properly to the regulation of the supply in the canal at\r\nnight. Probably some “tell-tale” watches would be useful. They would at\r\nleast show the times at which the men concerned went to the gauges or\r\nother points.\r\n\r\nAt the headworks, and at all important regulators, a stock of concrete\r\nblocks should be kept ready for the execution of any urgent repairs.\r\n\r\nRegarding the ordinary maintenance work on the channels, details are\r\ngiven in Appendices B and C. Appendix D, reprinted from _Punjab Rivers\r\nand Works_, contains rules for watching and protecting any banks or\r\nembankments which require it.\r\n\r\nSilt clearances and berm cutting of channels have been mentioned in Art.\r\n1. Special attention should be given to the accurate ranging of the\r\ncentre line. Otherwise the channel may become crooked. The great defect\r\nin the earthwork ordinarily met with in the banks of canals and\r\ndistributaries is that the clods are not broken. In consequence of this\r\nnew banks are extremely liable to breach, and much trouble and expense\r\nresult. Sometimes a dam is thrown across a new distributary, and the\r\nchannel upstream of it is gradually filled with water, the bank being\r\nwatched and leakages made good. The dam is then shifted to a place\r\nfurther down. In this way the banks are consolidated.\r\n\r\nWhen a distributary is closed for silt clearance or other work, if the\r\nhead regulator has planks and a double set of grooves, it is possible to\r\nstop all leakage by filling in earth between the two sets of planks and\r\nramming it, but otherwise it is necessary to construct an earthen dam\r\njust below the regulator. Upstream of the dam the water, owing to the\r\nleakage through the planks, gates or needles, rises to the same level as\r\nthe water in the canal. Native subordinates have a remarkable aptitude\r\nfor allowing such dams to break while the work in the distributary is in\r\nprogress or before it is measured. Now and then the dam is wilfully cut.\r\nThe remedy is to make the dam of proper strength--the top should be 8\r\nfeet wide and a foot above the water,--and to have it watched day and\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt a bend in a channel there is often a silt bank next the convex bank,\r\nand a hollow near the concave bank. The average bed level is probably\r\nvery much the same as in the straight reaches. Removal of the silt bank\r\nis unnecessary, and if removed it quickly forms again.\r\n\r\nAny length of channel in which the depth of silt to be cleared is small,\r\nsay ·50 foot in a large channel and ·40 foot in a small one, should not\r\nbe cleared, provided its length is considerable (say 1,000 feet), and\r\nthat it is not close to (say within 3,000 or 2,000 feet from) the head\r\nof the channel. Estimates should be prepared accordingly, the shallow\r\ndigging being struck out. Clearing a small depth of silt merely gives\r\ncontractors a chance of cheating by scraping the bed.\r\n\r\nIf the watercourses at the tail of a distributary are silted, the people\r\nshould be pressed to clear them. Otherwise there will be heading up of\r\nthe water of the distributary, and silt deposit may result.\r\n\r\nWhen a channel is scoured, any regulator in it can be kept partly closed\r\nso as to reduce the surface slope in the reach upstream of the regulator\r\nand encourage the deposit of silt. A table should, in such cases, be\r\ndrawn up giving the gauge readings to be maintained at the tail of the\r\nreach corresponding to given readings at the head.\r\n\r\nVarious methods of protecting banks are described in _River and Canal\r\nEngineering_, Chapter VI. The growing of plants on the inner slopes of\r\nchannels whose sides fall in, needs special attention. Some remarks on\r\nthis are given in _Punjab Rivers and Works_, Chapter II., Art. 3. A\r\nspecification for bushing is given in Appendix E of this volume.\r\n\r\nA Subdivisional Officer generally receives a steady stream of\r\napplications from members of the irrigating community regarding--among\r\nother matters--outlets or watercourses. Generally these applications are\r\nmade over to the zilladar to be reported on. In a large number of cases\r\nthe applicant states that the irrigation of his land or “holding” is not\r\nsatisfactory, or has fallen off, and sometimes he asks that it may be\r\ntransferred, wholly or in part, to another watercourse which he thinks\r\nwill give a better supply. In all such cases, and in some others, the\r\nfirst requirement is a statement of the irrigation figures. The\r\nirrigation register gives only the total for the watercourse. A printed\r\nform should be prepared with spaces for showing the name of the\r\ndistributary, villages, watercourses, holdings and applicants concerned,\r\nand the nature of the application. Below this is a form, prepared\r\nsomewhat as shown below. When this form is filled in, the state of\r\naffairs can at once be seen and much trouble is saved. The zilladar\r\nobtains the figures from the old field registers. The amount of detail\r\nrequired as to the applicant’s lands depends on the nature of his\r\napplication. If it deals with only part of his land the other parts\r\nshould also be shown. He may for instance be giving a disproportionate\r\nshare of water to one part. If a transfer to another watercourse is\r\nasked for, the figures for that watercourse are also required.\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------------------------------+--------+--------\r\n   Areas in Acres. |      Applicant’s Holding.        |Total of|Total of\r\n                   |-------+---------+---------+------| Water- |Distrib-\r\n                   |       |         |         |Total.| course.| utary.\r\n  -----------------+-------+---------+---------+------+--------+--------\r\n  Culturable       |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  commanded.       |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  Net  {19...-19...|       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  irri-{19...-19...|       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  gated{19...-19...|       |         |         |      |        |\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  -----------------+-------+---------+---------+------+--------+--------\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  Total of 3 years |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  -----------------+-------+---------+---------+------+--------+--------\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  Average          |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  -----------------+-------+---------+---------+------+--------+--------\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  Per cent. of     |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  culturable       |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  commanded        |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n                   |       |         |         |      |        |\r\n  -----------------+-------+---------+---------+------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nIf an application refers to a whole watercourse, the Subdivisional\r\nOfficer can frequently, with the aid of an irrigation register and a set\r\nof chak maps, both kept up to date, dispose personally of the case. A\r\ngood plan is to settle cases when on tour near the place concerned, the\r\napplicant and the zilladar being present as well as any other persons\r\nconcerned. A certain number of cases have to come up again on the\r\nfollowing tour, but all are settled in less time than is occupied if the\r\npapers go up and down between the Subdivisional Officer and the\r\nzilladar, the “file” of papers in any particular case being constantly\r\nswollen by reminders from the applicant.[39] Moreover, the applicants\r\nknow that their views are known to the Subdivisional Officer. If the\r\noutlets on a channel need a general remodelling, such applications as\r\nthose under consideration receive attention in connection with the\r\nscheme. Otherwise all the applications concerning one distributary can\r\nbe considered together. If, however, a case is pressing, or the steps to\r\nbe taken obvious, it can be settled without reference to any other case.\r\n\r\n  [39] The plan of personal settlement is distasteful not only to the\r\n  subordinates, but to the _munshi_ who has charge of the “vernacular\r\n  files.” Ordinarily he can delay a case, or manipulate it to some\r\n  extent.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangements for the “revenue” work or assessment of water\r\nrates have been stated in Art. 1. In the Punjab the remissions for\r\nfailed crops are a source of trouble. In some districts the failed areas\r\nare small, and no particular trouble arises, but in other districts such\r\nareas are often very large. On perennial canals the crop inspection is\r\ndone by the zilladars, on most of the inundation canals by the\r\nsubordinates of the District Magistrate.[40] In both cases the amount of\r\nlabour involved is enormous, and the corruption to which the system\r\ngives rise is also enormous. In the case of the inundation canals the\r\nsuperior staff of the District Magistrate nominally make checks, but the\r\ntime at their disposal is wholly inadequate. In the case of the\r\nperennial canals the Canal Engineers are able to exercise considerable\r\nchecks, but nothing like enough. In fact the state of a crop and the\r\nproportion of the charge on it which should be remitted is a difficult\r\nthing to judge, even if the subordinates were without guile. It is\r\nunderstood that a new and statesmanlike system is now to be introduced,\r\nthe District Magistrate deciding, in consultation with the Executive\r\nEngineer, whether the season is such as to call for any general\r\nremission for each kind of crop, and, if so, to what extent. The\r\nproportion to be remitted in that crop is then to be fixed, and it is to\r\nbe the same for every one.\r\n\r\n  [40] Officially called the “Collector” in some provinces, and “Deputy\r\n  Commissioner” in others.\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that some irrigation is effected by lift. The\r\nsimplest form of lift is a horizontal pole which rests, not far from its\r\nthick end, on a support. From its thick end is suspended a bucket, and\r\nfrom its thin end a weight. A man lifts the thin end so that the bucket\r\nthen dips into the water and is filled. Pulling down the thin end he\r\nraises the bucket and empties it. A greatly improved lifting apparatus\r\nis the Persian wheel which is vertical and has slung from it, like the\r\nbuckets of a dredger but moving vertically, a number of earthen jars,\r\nwhich scoop up the water. As each jar passes over the top of the wheel\r\nit assumes a horizontal position, discharges its water into a shoot, and\r\ndescends in an inverted position. The wheel is moved by a simple\r\ncog-wheel arrangement actuated by a bullock which is driven round and\r\nround in a circular track. The Persian wheel is used for lifts of any\r\nheight. The lift from a canal watercourse is a few feet, that from a\r\nwell may be 50 feet or more.\r\n\r\nMost persons consider that a system of charging for water by volume\r\nwould be a very great advance on present methods. It has been said that\r\nif the water were wasted it would be difficult for the cultivators to\r\nbring home the responsibility to any individual. This objection does not\r\nseem to have great force. Every individual would have a direct interest\r\nin economising the water, and any cultivator who was habitually careless\r\nwould soon be detected by the others. In all probability the result\r\nwould be a great improvement in the duty of the water. But the justice\r\nof any very rigid system of charging by volume is somewhat doubtful. The\r\ngreat difference in the duty of water on different watercourses has been\r\nmentioned more than once. Many of the causes of this are beyond the\r\ncontrol of the farmers, and it would probably be necessary to charge\r\nreduced rates to some of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE PUNJAB TRIPLE CANAL PROJECT.[41]\r\n\r\n\r\n  [41] See Report on the Project Estimates of the Upper Jhelum, Upper\r\n  Chenab, and Lower Bari Doab Canals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =General Description.= Fig. 26 shows part of the Punjab. The areas\r\nmarked L.J., L.C., U.B.D., and S.C. are already irrigated by the Lower\r\nJhelum, Lower Chenab, Upper Bari Doab[42] and Sirhind Canals. The areas\r\nwhich it is considered very desirable to irrigate, and which are\r\nprovided for in the Triple Canal Project, are marked U.J., U.C., and\r\nL.B.D., and the new canals are shown by dotted lines. Other areas\r\nneeding irrigation lie on the left bank of the lower part of the Sutlej,\r\npartly in British territory and partly in Bahawalpur State, and one\r\narea,[43] of scant rainfall and subject to occasional famine, lies\r\nimmediately South of the Sirhind Canal tract. There is also a very large\r\narea between the Indus and the Jhelum, and it has been proposed to\r\nirrigate it from the Indus, but on account of the presence of sand-hills\r\nthe project is not likely to be so useful as others, and it is held in\r\nabeyance. Perhaps a small canal may be constructed, as a tentative\r\nmeasure, to irrigate part of the tract.\r\n\r\n  [42] Doab means “two waters,” or the tract between two rivers. The\r\n  names of the three Doabs under consideration are formed from those of\r\n  the rivers. They are called the Jech (Jhelum-Chenab), Rechna\r\n  (Ravi-Chenab), and Bari (Beas-Ravi) Doabs.\r\n\r\n  [43] It would be very expensive to bring water for this tract from the\r\n  Beas and across the Sutlej.\r\n\r\nThe winter discharges of the rivers (available for the rabi crop) after\r\nthe existing irrigation has been supplied, are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Indus,   9,434 c. feet per second (minimum)\r\n  Jhelum,  6,800    „       „       (average)\r\n  Chenab,   Nil\r\n  Ravi,     Nil\r\n  Beas,    4,000    „       „       (minimum)\r\n  Sutlej,   Nil\r\n\r\nIn summer all the rivers have discharges (available for the kharif crop)\r\nfar exceeding any requirements. It was at one time proposed to supply\r\nthe Lower Bari Doab Canal from near the junction of the Beas and Sutlej,\r\nand a project for this was prepared, but before it was sanctioned a\r\nproposal was put forward to convey the surplus water of the Jhelum\r\neastward across the Chenab and Ravi. This valuable suggestion was made\r\nby Sir James Wilson, who was then Settlement Commissioner of the Punjab,\r\nand, independently, by the late Colonel S. L. Jacob, R.E., who had been\r\na Chief Engineer in the Punjab. The proposals were, however, to take off\r\nthe supply from the Jhelum lower down than as now arranged in the Triple\r\nProject. This would have resulted in only a partial utilisation of the\r\nJhelum water, in mutilation or heavy alterations to the existing Lower\r\nJhelum and Lower Chenab Canals, in for ever debarring the Upper Jhelum\r\nand Upper Chenab tracts from irrigation, and in a very costly scheme for\r\nthe Lower Bari Doab Canal.[44]\r\n\r\n  [44] Colonel Jacob made his suggestion when in England after retiring\r\n  from India, and when he had no levels to guide him.\r\n\r\nThe Triple Project as prepared by Sir John Benton, K.C.I.E., recently\r\nInspector General of Irrigation in India, gets over all the above\r\nobjections. The Upper Jhelum Canal is to irrigate the country which it\r\ntraverses, and in the winter, when the supply in the rivers is\r\nrestricted, it is to deliver into the river Chenab, above the weir at\r\nthe head of the Lower Chenab Canal, a discharge equal to that drawn out\r\nhigher up by the Upper Chenab Canal.[45] Thus the Lower Chenab Canal,\r\nwhich at present draws off the whole of the water of the Chenab in\r\nwinter, will not be injuriously affected in any way. The Upper Chenab\r\nCanal after irrigating its own tract is to deliver a large volume of\r\nwater into the Ravi. The water will be taken across that river by a\r\nlevel crossing, and supply the Lower Bari Doab Canal. The water brought\r\ninto the Sutlej from the Beas will remain available for irrigation on\r\nthe left bank of the Sutlej, or possibly for the dry tract South of the\r\nSirhind Canal area. This fine scheme presented many difficulties and is\r\nnecessarily costly. The water has to be conveyed a great distance, and\r\nthere will be much loss by absorption. The Ravi crossing will be a very\r\nheavy work. The Upper Jhelum Canal has to be taken by a circuitous\r\ncourse round a range of hills, and to cross numerous heavy torrents. The\r\nscheme will, however, prove remunerative in spite of immense\r\ndifficulties as to labour, caused by the outbreak of plague in the\r\nPunjab a few years ago.\r\n\r\n  [45] The Indus is at a higher level than the Jhelum. The latter river\r\n  runs in a comparatively deep valley, and it is unfortunately\r\n  impossible to convey the water of the Indus across this valley.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Areas and Discharges.= The figures on which the discharges in the\r\nTriple Project are based form a useful and interesting object lesson. In\r\norder to obtain sufficient water in the winter, it is necessary to\r\nreduce the rabi supply to the existing Lower Jhelum Canal. The figure\r\nabove given for the Jhelum indicates the supply available after the\r\nreduction. More water will be supplied to the Lower Jhelum Canal for the\r\nkharif, the canal being enlarged for this purpose, and its total\r\nirrigation will be unaffected. The proportion of the culturable\r\ncommanded area to be irrigated in the new tracts is 75 per cent., but\r\nfrom this the area irrigated by wells in the Upper Jhelum and Upper\r\nChenab tracts is deducted. On the Lower Bari Doab Canal there is little\r\nwell Irrigation, but there are some low-lying tracts near the rivers,\r\nand of these only 50 per cent. will be irrigated. The kharif and rabi\r\nareas are in all cases to be equal.\r\n\r\nThe areas to be irrigated in each crop are as below--\r\n\r\n  Lower Jhelum Canal      383,091  acres\r\n  Upper Jhelum Canal      172,480    „\r\n  Upper Chenab Canal      324,184    „\r\n  Lower Bari Doab Canal   441,264    „\r\n                        ---------\r\n                Total   1,321,019    „\r\n\r\nThe total, excluding the existing Lower Jhelum Canal, is 937,928 acres.\r\nWith an equal area in the other crop, the new annual irrigation amounts\r\nto 1,875,856 acres.\r\n\r\nThe kharif duty is taken as 100 acres at the distributary heads, this\r\nbeing about the figure actually obtained on the Lower Chenab and Upper\r\nBari Doab Canals, and the required kharif discharges at the distributary\r\nheads are:\r\n\r\n  Lower Jhelum                   3,821 c. feet per second\r\n  Upper   „                      1,725    „       „\r\n    „   Chenab                   3,242    „       „\r\n  Lower Bari Doab                4,413    „       „\r\n                                 -----\r\n  Total, excluding Lower Jhelum  9,380    „       „\r\n\r\nThe losses of water in canal and branches have been found to be, on the\r\nUpper Bari Doab Canal 10 c. feet per second, and on the Lower Chenab\r\nCanal 8 c. feet per second, per million square feet of wetted area\r\nrespectively. The conditions of the latter canal most resemble those on\r\nthe new canals under consideration. The losses calculated on the wetted\r\nareas of the channels, as designed, at 8 c. feet per second per million\r\nsquare feet, are as follows, in c. feet per second:\r\n\r\n  Lower Jhelum Canal      624}  1,288\r\n  Upper Jhelum Canal      664}\r\n\r\n  Upper Chenab Canal    1,161}  2,126\r\n  Lower Bari Doab Canal   965}\r\n                        -----\r\n                 Total  3,414\r\n\r\nBut in dry years the canals will be worked in rotation during the rabi,\r\nthe Upper Chenab and Lower Bari Doab Canals being worked together, and\r\nthe Upper Jhelum and Lower Jhelum together.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lower Jhelum Canal is closed, in course of rotation, the Upper\r\nJhelum Canal will still be flowing, and the loss in it, 664 c. feet per\r\nsecond, has to be added to the figure (2,126) given above, thus bringing\r\nup the loss to 2,790 c. feet per second.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain what the state of affairs will be in the rabi, the\r\nstatistics obtained on the Lower Chenab Canal were examined. These show\r\nthat the rabi duty at the distributary heads on that canal is 206 acres.\r\nOn the Upper Bari Doab Canal the duty at the distributary heads is 263\r\nacres, but 11 per cent. of the area receives only “first waterings.” The\r\nduty based on the remaining area is 234 acres. But the above duties are\r\nonly attained by running higher supplies in October and March than\r\nduring the intervening four months of the crop. The following remarks\r\nand figures are taken from the Report on the Project Estimates:--\r\n\r\n“The statistics of working of distributaries of the Chenab and Bari Doab\r\nCanals give the average discharges shown in the following table for the\r\nthree years ending with 1903-04. The losses by absorption are calculated\r\non the wetted areas for the different rotational periods. The average\r\ndischarge less absorption is the supply which reached the heads of the\r\ndistributaries.\r\n\r\nCHENAB CANAL.\r\n\r\n  ------------------+--------------------------------------------+------\r\n                    |                     PERIOD.                | AVER-\r\n                    +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+ AGE.\r\n     PARTICULARS.   | Octo-| Octo-| No- |  De-|Janu-| Feb-|March.|\r\n                    |  ber |  ber | vem-| cem-|ary. | ru- |      |\r\n                    | 1st- | 16th-| ber |  ber|     | ary |      |\r\n                    | 15th |  31st|     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  ------------------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n                    |  Cu- |  Cu- | Cu- | Cu- | Cu- | Cu- |  Cu- |  Cu-\r\n                    | secs.| secs.|secs.|secs.|secs.|secs.| secs.| secs.\r\n  Average supply    |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  entering head of  |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  canal             |10,196|10,285|7,788|5,593|5,127|5,500| 6,603| 6,809\r\n                    |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  Deduct absorption | 1,633| 1,633|1,250|1,053|1,032|1,171| 1,433| 1,262\r\n                    +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n  Supply at distrib-|      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  utary heads for   |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  1,155,685 acres,  |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  the average Bari  |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  area              | 8,563| 8,652|6,538|4,510|4,095|4,329| 5,170| 5,546\r\n                    +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n  Proportional      |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  supply for        |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  1,164,595 acres   | 8,631| 8,721|6,590|4,576|4,128|4,364| 5,211| 5,591\r\n                    |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  Add absorption for|      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  new projects      | 3,414| 3,414|2,139|2,139|2,139|2,139| 3,414| 2,564\r\n                    +------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n  Supply required   |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  for new projects  |      |      |     |     |     |     |      |\r\n  at heads of canals|12,045|12,035|8,729|6,715|6,267|6,503| 8,625| 8,155\r\n  ------------------+------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+------+------\r\n\r\n“The average discharge given by the third line is 5,546, and the average\r\narea being 1,155,685 acres, the duty at the heads of distributaries was\r\n208.\r\n\r\n“The area 1,164,595 is the perennial rabi irrigation of the new\r\nprojects, the area 156,424 acres, receiving only first waterings, being\r\nomitted to admit of a fair comparison, and is only 1 per cent. under the\r\naverage attained on the Chenab Canal in the three years for which the\r\ntable is prepared.\r\n\r\n“The absorption added for the two first periods is on the supposition\r\nthat all the canals are open throughout October and March, tatilling[46]\r\nwith an average absorption loss of 2,139 cusecs[47] being in force\r\nduring the other four months.

supplies available in the Jhelum\r\n  River in October and March every year and in some or all of the\r\n  intervening months in other years, it is advisable to give the Upper\r\n  Jhelum Canal the large capacity of 8,500 cusecs proposed.\r\n\r\n  (_ii_) In favourable and ordinary years, that is, in 3 out of 4, the\r\n  available supply will be ample, as shown by the low duties of 189 and\r\n  167 compared with those obtaining on the Lower Chenab and Upper Bari\r\n  Doab Canals.\r\n\r\n  (_iii_) In dry years, that is, 1 in 4, it will be necessary to attain\r\n  a duty almost exactly the same as that now obtaining on the Upper Bari\r\n  Doab Canal.\r\n\r\n  (_iv_) That an exceptionally dry year might occur once in 14 years,\r\n  when the supply would be 10 per cent. short of that required by the\r\n  average Upper Bari Doab Canal standard of requirements: such\r\n  exceptional cases should be met by remissions, which will be far\r\n  preferable to wasting the good supplies of 13 years out of 14.\r\n\r\n  (_v_) That the occasional occurrence of dry years makes it inadvisable\r\n  to attempt a greater proportion of rabi than half of the annual\r\n  irrigation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Remarks.= The Report on the Project estimates gives, for each tract,\r\nremarks on its soil, rainfall, height of subsoil water, circumstances as\r\nto existing irrigation from wells or small canals and liability to\r\nfloods. On a consideration of these matters the decision as to the\r\nparticular parts of the tracts which are to be irrigated and the areas\r\nwhich are, in the rabi, to receive only restricted irrigation,\r\ndepends.[50]\r\n\r\n  [50] It is not unusual, in tracts where the level of the subsoil water\r\n  is high, say within 15 feet of the surface, to have some “kharif\r\n  distributaries.” These are closed in the rabi. This tends to prevent\r\n  water-logging of the soil. In the rabi the people lift water from\r\n  wells. There may also be kharif distributaries in dry tracts if there\r\n  is no water to spare in the rabi.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the sizes of the canals, N in Kutter’s co-efficient was\r\ntaken at ·020. In sharp curves the bed is paved on the side next the\r\nconcave bank. In high embankments where the soil is sandy the best\r\nmaterial is used as a core wall. The torrent works on the Upper Jhelum\r\nCanal have been mentioned in _River and Canal Engineering_, Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nRegarding the effect of the new canals on the inundation canals which\r\ntake off, lower down, from the Chenab below its confluence with the\r\nJhelum, it has for long been the policy to gradually shift the heads of\r\nthese canals upstream in order to obtain better supplies, or rather to\r\ncounteract the effect of the abstraction of water for the recently\r\nconstructed Lower Chenab and Lower Jhelum Canals. Any such abstraction\r\nof water has not much effect on the floods, but it has much effect in\r\nApril and May, when the rivers have not fully risen, and in September,\r\nwhen they are falling.\r\n\r\nIn order to estimate the effect on the water level of the Chenab--below\r\nits junction with the Jhelum--it was necessary to observe discharges of\r\nthe river, not only in the winter when it is low, but in the summer when\r\nit is high. The depth of the water was in some places 40 feet, and the\r\nstream 2,000 feet wide. Fortunately the Subdivisional Officer was a\r\nnative of India and did not much mind the sun. A discharge curve (_River\r\nand Canal Engineering_, Chapter III. Art. 5,) having been prepared, it\r\nwas possible to construct a diagram with periods of time as the\r\nabscissas, the ordinates representing the average known gauge readings\r\non the different dates and another set of ordinates representing the\r\nprobable discharges. By deducting the discharges which it was intended\r\nthat the new perennial canals should draw off, it was possible to draw\r\nfresh ordinates representing the diminished river discharges and the\r\nreduced river gauge readings corresponding to them. It was found that\r\nthe water level would be lowered by about 1·3 feet in April and May, and\r\nby about 1·5 feet in September. It was, however, shown that by shifting\r\nthe heads of the inundation canals upstream--the gradients of the canals\r\nbeing flatter than that of the river--the effect of the lowering of the\r\nwater level could, as heretofore, be nullified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROPOSED IMPROVEMENTS IN IRRIGATION CANALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. =Preliminary Remarks.=--The chief improvements which have been under\r\nconsideration during recent years are three in number. The first is\r\nincreased economy of water in its actual use in the fields; the second\r\nis reduction of the losses by absorption in the channels; and the third\r\nis distribution by means of modules.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first, it has long been known that the ordinary methods of\r\nlaying on the water are more or less wasteful. In California, when the\r\nwater instead of being applied to the surface of the ground, is brought\r\nin a pipe and delivered below the ground level, the duty is increased\r\nfrom 250 to 500 acres. In India a field is divided, by means of small\r\nridges of earth, into large compartments. The water is let into a\r\ncompartment and gradually covers it. By the time the further side is\r\nsoaked the nearer side has received far too much water. Frequently the\r\nwater for a compartment, instead of being carried up to it by a small\r\nwatercourse, is passed through another compartment and this adds to the\r\nwaste. Also the number of waterings given to a crop is often 5 or 6,\r\nwhen 4 would suffice. Experiments made on the Upper Bari Doab Canal, by\r\nKennedy, showed that the water used in the fields was nearly double what\r\nit might have been. The 53 c. ft. shown in Chapter 1, Art. 4, as\r\nreaching the fields, were used up when 28 c. ft. would have sufficed. It\r\nis not certain that the waste is generally quite as much as the above.\r\nIt is possible that the restricted supplies might have given smaller\r\nyields of crops. More recent experiments made by Kanthack on the same\r\ncanal give the needless waste as about 25 per cent. The field\r\ncompartments ought, according to Kennedy, to be 70ft. square, the small\r\nbranch watercourses being 140ft. apart. It would be better to have still\r\nsmaller compartments, but this would be rather hard on the people.\r\n\r\nAt one time Government issued orders, in Northern India, that\r\ncompartments of 1296 square feet were to be used, and that, otherwise,\r\nincreased water rates would be charged, but the orders were never\r\nenforced. They were thought to press too hardly on the people. Extreme\r\nmeasures for enforcing economy in the use of water in any country are\r\nlikely to be introduced only when they become absolutely necessary owing\r\nto the supplies of water being otherwise insufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. =Reduction of Losses in the Channels.=--For several years experiments\r\nhave been going on in the Punjab as to the effect of lining watercourses\r\nwith various materials. The following conclusions have been arrived\r\nat[51]:--\r\n\r\n  [51] _Punjab Irrigation Paper_ No. 11 C. “Lining of Watercourses to\r\n  reduce absorption losses. Experiments of 1908-1911.”\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ORDINARY UNLINED TRENCHES.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) The rate of absorption varies greatly, and this is due probably\r\n  to unequal fissuring of the upper layers of the soil.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The rate of absorption in the three hottest months averaged\r\n  ·0571 feet per hour, or more than double the rate (·026) in the three\r\n  coldest months. The difference is ascribed to the greater viscosity\r\n  of the water when cold.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) The average losses with canal water were ·0315 feet per hour, or\r\n  8·75 c. feet per second per million sq. feet.[52] With well water the\r\n  figures were ·1096 and 30·5. The conclusion is that the silt in canal\r\n  water reduces the losses by more than two-thirds.\r\n\r\n  [52] This loss of 8·75 c. ft. per second was in water only about a\r\n  foot deep. This confirms the conclusion arrived at in Chapter I, Art.\r\n  4, that the depth of water is not a factor of much importance.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) With canal water the average loss decreased by 40 per cent.\r\n  (from ·0491 to ·0293) in about four years. This was no doubt due to\r\n  the effect of the silt. With well water the loss at the end of four\r\n  years (·2293) was nearly four times as great as at first (·0591). This\r\n  may have been due to removal of the finer particles of soil by the\r\n  water, but the experiments were made at only one place, and were not\r\n  conclusive.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LINED TRENCHES.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) With trenches lined with crude oil ¹⁄₁₆ inch thick, or with\r\n  Portland cement ¹⁄₁₆ inch thick, or with clay puddle 6 inches thick,\r\n  the “efficiency ratios,” as compared with unlined trenches, are\r\n  respectively about 4·0, 5·7 and 5·7, the age of the lining being four\r\n  years. The efficiency ratio is the inverse of the loss. Thus with an\r\n  efficiency ratio of 3 the loss in the lined trench is 33 per cent. of\r\n  that in the unlined trench.\r\n\r\n  (_f_) The efficiency ratio in the case of oil may diminish at the rate\r\n  of 10 per cent. per annum, but in the case of cement and clay puddle\r\n  it tends to increase rather than to decrease.\r\n\r\nAssuming that the efficiency ratios are only 3·0, 4·5 and 4·5, and that\r\nthe loss in an unlined channel is 8 c. feet per second per million sq.\r\nfeet, the saving in water by using channels lined with oil, cement and\r\npuddle respectively would be 5·33, 6·25 and 6·25 c. feet per second. The\r\naverage duty of the water at the canal head is about 242 acres, and the\r\naverage revenue per acre is Rs 3·93. The revenue from 1 c. ft. of water\r\nat the canal head is thus Rs 950. Only about half the water reaches the\r\nfields (Chapter I., Art. 4), and the revenue from 1 c. ft. of water\r\nwhich reaches the fields is about Rs 1900. The mean of the above two\r\nsums is Rs 1425. If 6 c. ft. of water per second could be saved the\r\nrevenue would be increased by Rs 8,550 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe cost of lining a million square feet of channel with oil, cement and\r\npuddle is estimated at Rs 30,000, Rs 27,500 and Rs 35,000 respectively.\r\nAllowance has to be made for the fact that watercourses flow\r\nintermittently, and that a lined channel gives no saving when it is not\r\nin flow, also that extensions of canals might have to be undertaken in\r\norder to utilise the water saved. After making these allowances it is\r\nestimated, in the paper above quoted, that the saving effected by lining\r\na million square feet with oil, cement or puddle represents the interest\r\non a capital sum of Rs 69,300, Rs 81,250 and Rs 81,250 respectively, or\r\n2 or 3 times the sums sunk in constructing the linings.\r\n\r\nHitherto the experiments have been carried out on a moderate scale, but\r\nextensive operations are now being undertaken on the Lower Chenab\r\nCanal, and possibly on others.\r\n\r\nIn cases where it is not desired to incur much expenditure, it may be a\r\ngood plan to construct watercourses to a cross section somewhat larger\r\nthan that ultimately desired. The silt deposited on the bed and sides\r\nforms, in most cases, a more impervious lining than the original soil.\r\nThe same plan can be adopted in the tail portion of a distributary. In a\r\nlarger channel there would be less certainty that any deposit would take\r\nplace unless short lengths, at frequent intervals, were excavated to the\r\ntrue or ultimate section, so as to form weirs and spurs; and even these\r\nmight not stand.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, in cases where the water naturally contains lime in\r\nsuspension, the beds of canals have become gradually watertight by the\r\ndeposit of lime in the channel.[53] In some cases lime has been\r\nartificially added. It appears that a considerable period of time is\r\nnecessary for the process.\r\n\r\n  [53] Min. Proc. Inst. C. E. Vol. CXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. =Modules.=--A module is an appliance which automatically gives a\r\nconstant discharge through an aperture, however the water level on\r\neither the upstream or downstream side of the aperture may fluctuate. In\r\nan old and simple form of module there is a horizontal orifice in which\r\nworks loosely a tapering rod attached to a float. The water passes\r\nthrough the annular space surrounding the rod. If the water level rises,\r\nthe rise of the float brings a thicker part of the rod to the orifice\r\nand reduces the annular space. In another kind of module the water is\r\ndischarged through a syphon. If the water level alters, the syphon moves\r\nin such a way that the head, or difference between the levels of its\r\ntwo ends, remains the same. The great objections to modules are that\r\nthey are liable to get out of order or to be tampered with. A module\r\nrecently invented and patented by Gibb[54] has no movable parts, and is\r\nnot liable to these objections.\r\n\r\n  [54] For description see Appendix H.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the question of the desirability of using modules for\r\nthe outlets of distributaries in India was raised. The opinions of a\r\nlarge number of the senior canal engineers were called for and\r\nconsidered, and since then the subject has been thoroughly discussed.\r\nThere are certain inherent difficulties in the way of moduling the\r\noutlets of a distributary. Owing, for instance, to rain further up the\r\ncanal, or to the closure of a distributary owing to a breach in it, the\r\ncanal supply may increase, and it may be necessary to let more water\r\ninto the distributary under consideration. Under the present system any\r\nexcesses of water are automatically taken by the outlets. If all outlets\r\nwere rigidly moduled they would discharge no more than before the excess\r\nsupply came in, and the excess supply would all go to the tail of the\r\ndistributary, and, most likely, breach the banks. To get over this\r\ndifficulty, the module has to be so arranged that when the water level\r\nin the distributary rises to a certain “maximum limit” the module ceases\r\nto act as such, and the discharge drawn off from the distributary\r\nincreases as the water level rises. Again, the discharge of the\r\ndistributary may at times be considerably less than its full supply. In\r\norder that, in such a case, the outlets towards the tail of the\r\ndistributary may not be wholly deprived of water, it has to be arranged\r\nso that when the water level in the distributary falls below a certain\r\n“minimum limit” the modules cease to act as such, and draw off supplies\r\nwhich are less the lower the water level. Such supplies are not in\r\nproportion to the full supplies of the outlets. It will, however, be\r\nshown presently that low supplies need seldom be run. When a\r\ndistributary, say the upper reach, contains silt, the water level\r\ncorresponding to a given discharge is higher than before, and care has\r\nto be taken that the maximum limit is high enough. At the same time the\r\nminimum limit must be so low that it will not be passed when the silt\r\nscours out. The difference between the maximum and minimum limits is\r\ncalled the “range” of the module.\r\n\r\nIn Gibb’s module the above conditions can be complied with. The module\r\nis placed outside the bank of the distributary. The water is drawn off\r\nfrom the distributary by a pipe, whose lower edge is at the bed level of\r\nthe distributary, and delivered from the module into the watercourse\r\nthrough a rectangular aperture at a higher level than that of the pipe.\r\nIt is possible that, owing to the high level of the aperture, some\r\nrolling silt which would otherwise have passed out of the distributary\r\nmay remain in it. The height of the aperture also prevents the\r\nwatercourse from drawing off any water at all when the water level of\r\nthe distributary falls below a certain level, but this objection is not\r\nimportant. An escape weir or notch is provided so that when the water\r\nlevel in the distributary rises to the maximum limit some water\r\noverflows into the watercourse. On the whole it appears that all\r\ndifficulties can be got over, though a good deal of care and precision\r\nis necessary in fixing the exact height of the maximum and minimum\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties under consideration will all be reduced if some of the\r\noutlets on a distributary are left unmoduled, and this is desirable on\r\nother grounds. When the supply is normal, _i.e._ between the maximum and\r\nminimum limits, and all modules are working, the supply entering the\r\ndistributary must be regulated with great precision. The outlets draw\r\noff a certain supply. If less than this enters the distributary the tail\r\noutlets must go short. If more enters there will be a surplus at the\r\ntail, though it can probably be disposed of, because the tail water will\r\nrise above the maximum limit. For short periods, say an hour or two, no\r\ntrouble arises because the distributary acts as a reservoir, the water\r\nlevel rising to take in any excess supply, and falling to allow for a\r\ndeficiency. At the tail the rise and fall may be hardly perceptible. But\r\nif the supply were deficient for a whole night the tail outlets would\r\ncertainly go short. This could theoretically be remedied to some extent\r\nby letting in an excess supply for a short time and causing the water\r\nlevel at the tail to rise above the maximum limit, but in practice no\r\nsuch system of compensation could be worked. The very fact of the tail\r\noutlets having gone short for a night would not be known. The proper\r\nmethod of preventing any such troubles as those under consideration is\r\nto leave some of the outlets on the distributary un-moduled.\r\n\r\nIt has been more than once mentioned that there are periods when a\r\ndistributary is run, not full, but about three-fourths full. If that\r\nwere done in the case of a distributary whose outlets were mostly\r\nmoduled, the water level would probably be below the minimum limit, and\r\nthe modules would not be acting as such. The outlets would not, under\r\nthese circumstances, obtain their proper proportionate supplies. This\r\ndifficulty can, no doubt, be got over by running the distributary full\r\nfor short periods at a time instead of three-fourths full for longer\r\nperiods. The people, when once they understood the case, could arrange\r\nto use the water in greater volume for two days instead of in smaller\r\nvolume for three. If this arrangement comes into force it will not be\r\nnecessary to design distributaries--see Chapter III, Art. 4--so as to\r\nhave a good command when three-fourths full supply is run.\r\n\r\nOn nearly every distributary there are some watercourses whose command\r\nis bad, and it has been stated (Chapter II, Art. 9) that in an ordinary\r\nunmoduled distributary the sizes of the outlets in such cases should be\r\nextremely liberal. To module any such outlet would cause a lowering of\r\nthe water level in the watercourse and would interfere with the\r\nirrigation. Such outlets should not be moduled. Again, there are some\r\nfew outlets which are not submerged, _i.e._, there is a free fall into\r\nthe watercourse. The discharge does not depend on the water level in the\r\nwatercourse, and it is not affected by any enlargement or clearance of\r\nit. It depends only on the water level in the distributary. This water\r\nlevel, if most of the outlets are moduled, will be fairly constant. Such\r\noutlets need not be moduled, and they should not be moduled unless the\r\nother unmoduled outlets in the reach concerned are sufficiently\r\nnumerous, and perhaps not even then, because moduling involves some\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nA distributary generally has some falls which divide it into reaches.\r\nImmediately upstream of a fall the water level for a given discharge is\r\nnot affected by the silting or scouring of the channel. Any outlets near\r\nto and upstream of the fall are less subject than others to variation in\r\ndischarge, and are suitable for non-moduling in case a sufficient number\r\nof unmoduled outlets is not otherwise obtainable.\r\n\r\nRegarding the watercourses at the extreme tail of a distributary it has\r\nbeen pointed out (Chapter III., Art. 7) that in an ordinary case they\r\nshould not be left without masonry outlets, because they may then lower\r\nthe water level and so unfairly reduce the supply of any watercourse,\r\neven though upstream of them, which has such an outlet. But any outlets\r\nnear the tail of a distributary can suitably be left unmoduled because\r\nof the difficulty of ensuring that the supply at the tail shall be\r\nexactly what is needed.\r\n\r\nGibb’s modules have been tried on various distributaries in the Punjab\r\nand found to give good results. It is believed however that in only one\r\ncase has a whole distributary been moduled. The distributary is a large\r\none, its length being 35 miles. It appears that the discharge reaching\r\nthe tail of the distributary is not constant but varies, as was to be\r\nexpected, when the head discharge varies for any length of time. The\r\ncommand on the distributary is good. There is nothing to show that\r\nmatters would not have been improved, and money saved, by leaving some\r\nof the outlets without modules.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked above, that at the downstream end of a reach ending\r\nin a fall, the F.S. level of a distributary is not affected by silt. At\r\nthe upstream end of the reach it is affected. There are thus two\r\ngradients, one flat, and one steep. It appears to have been decided in\r\none case in the Punjab, that the minimum limit of supply for the module\r\nshould be about half an inch below the flat line and the maximum limit\r\n·3 feet above the steep line. In many cases a greater range would be\r\nrequired,[55] say a foot.\r\n\r\n  [55] It is understood that a range of a foot can easily be arranged\r\n  for, and that ranges of 3 or 4 feet can be introduced at slightly\r\n  increased cost.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter III. Art. 7, the case of a distributary without modules but\r\nwith the outlets carefully adjusted, was considered. The question to be\r\ndecided in each case is whether such an arrangement is preferable to\r\nmoduling some of the outlets. This turns largely on the amount of\r\nattention which would be bestowed on the case. In view of the difficulty\r\nof securing such attention and of the trouble of constantly making\r\nalterations in a certain number of outlets, it is probable that moduling\r\nwill in many cases be considered preferable.\r\n\r\nThe question of moduling the heads of distributaries has also been\r\nconsidered in the Punjab. For minor or small distributaries modules are\r\nfeasible. For a large distributary a module would be expensive and it\r\nappears that the present system of regulating is preferable.\r\n\r\nKennedy’s “Gauge Outlet,” which is a kind of semi-module is described in\r\nAppendix K. It is being tried in the Punjab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nDIVIDE WALL ON LOWER CHENAB CANAL.\r\n\r\n(See page 50, first footnote.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nThe Gagera branch of the Lower Chenab Canal--the left-hand branch in\r\nfig. 27--was found to silt. It was proposed to make a divide wall (fig.\r\n27) extending up to full supply level. The idea is unintelligible. The\r\nsilt does not travel by itself but is carried or rolled by the water. As\r\nlong as water entered the Gagera branch, silt would go with it. The\r\nauthorities, who had apparently accepted the proposal, altered the\r\nestimate when they received it, and ordered the wall to be made as shown\r\ndotted and of only half the height. This was done. The idea seems to\r\nhave been that the wall would act as a sill and stop rolling silt. This\r\nis intelligible, but such sills do not always have much effect on\r\nrolling silt. Moreover, there was a large gap, A B, in the wall. The\r\nwork is said to have proved useless, and proposals have been made to\r\ncontinue the wall from A to B. In this form it is conceivable that it\r\nmay be of use.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nSPECIFICATION FOR MAINTENANCE OF CHANNELS.\r\n\r\n(See page 138.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

To be promptly\r\nsubmitted for each breach to the Executive Engineer. The report contains\r\na column for cost of closure. This means the stoppage of the flow and\r\nnot the complete making up of the banks. The column for remarks of the\r\nExecutive Engineer should be filled in and the report promptly returned\r\nto the Subdivisional Officer, who will, in the meantime, be making up\r\nthe banks and preparing a requisition or estimate.\r\n\r\n  [62] Not printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. =Progress Report.=--With the Executive Engineer’s monthly progress\r\nreport a list of breaches will be submitted, canal by canal, with\r\ncolumns showing date of occurrence and cost of closure. The return\r\nshould be on the attached form G.[63] The Subdivisional Officer should\r\nalso submit this form to the Executive Engineer.\r\n\r\n  [63] Not printed.

It may be impossible to do any good and money may be\r\nuselessly spent. In any such cases the Subdivisional Officer should at\r\nonce proceed to the spot and the case should be reported by wire to the\r\nExecutive Engineer and, if necessary, to the Superintending Engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. =Breaches in Flood Embankments.=--The Subdivisional Officer must at\r\nonce proceed to the spot and the case be reported by wire to the\r\nExecutive Engineer and Superintending Engineer. The Breach Report forms\r\ncan be submitted partially filled in at the earliest possible moment and\r\na complete form afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\nSPECIFICATION FOR BUSHING.\r\n\r\n(See page 139.)\r\n\r\n1. The object of bushing is to form a silt berm and thus prevent or stop\r\nthe falling in of the banks.\r\n\r\n2. The branches must be thickly packed in order that the water among\r\nthem may become still, and also in order that they may not be shifted by\r\nthe stream. If thickly packed, the pegs required will also be fewer.\r\nMost of the branches should be leafy and freshly cut, but, mixed with\r\nthese, there may be a proportion of kikar or other leafless branches.\r\nFrequently it is possible to utilise jungle trees of small value,\r\nbushes, scrub jungle, or even long grass.\r\n\r\n3. Except when the bushes are to be very small or the length to be\r\nbushed very short, the proposed line for the edge of the berm should be\r\nmarked out by long stakes driven in the water at fairly close intervals.\r\nOtherwise the work may be badly done and the berm formed imperfect and\r\nout of line.\r\n\r\n4. As the berm formed is not likely in any case to be perfectly\r\nstraight, and as subsequent additions to it will be difficult, while\r\ntrimming it will be easy, the bushes should extend slightly beyond the\r\nline of the proposed berm. Care should be taken that the lower branches,\r\nwhich cannot be seen when once submerged, are long enough.\r\n\r\n5. The branches should be piled up to above water-level, so that, as\r\nthey settle, they will assume the position desired, but to lay them high\r\nabove full-supply level on the slopes is useless and wasteful. If the\r\npegs have to be driven at a high level, the branches should be attached\r\nto them by thin ropes or twine. Long pegs standing up high above the\r\nground are also wasteful. The pegs should as far as possible be kept in\r\nline and their heads at one level.\r\n\r\n6. If bushing is begun during low supply, it need not, at first, extend\r\nup to full-supply level. More branches, freshly cut, can be added as the\r\nsupply rises. In any case it is generally necessary to make some\r\nadditions to bushing from time to time, and this should be explained to\r\ncontractors and others when fixing the rates.\r\n\r\n7. If the trees from which branches are cut are in desirable places, the\r\nbranches should be cut with judgment; but where trees are in places\r\nwhere they should not be (_e.g._, on the inside slopes of the channels),\r\nall the branches may be cut off. The trunk may be left temporarily in\r\norder to supply more branches.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX F.\r\n\r\nESCAPES.\r\n\r\n(See page 9.)\r\n\r\nThere are no definite rules regarding the capacity of the escapes to be\r\nprovided on a canal. On some canals in dry tracts of country the\r\ndischarging power of the escapes is a mere fraction of that of the\r\ncanal. In other cases it is about half that of the canal. In a district\r\nliable to heavy rain an escape, say at a point where a canal divides\r\ninto branches, should be able to discharge about half of the main canal\r\nsupply. On branches, escapes, if provided at all, usually discharge into\r\nreservoirs, and their period of working is very limited: it may be only\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nOn distributaries, escapes are seldom provided. It has been suggested,\r\nin connection with modules, that the people irrigating from each\r\nwatercourse should be responsible for disposing, by means of it, of a\r\ncertain quantity of surplus water. This would be too rigid a rule. On\r\nsome watercourses there is much waste land or land under rice\r\ncultivation; in such cases surplus water can be passed off without\r\ndamage. The canal subordinates are fully cognisant of such cases, and\r\nthey arrange accordingly. In other cases surplus water would do some\r\ndamage; but on nearly every distributary the full supply, even when\r\nthere is no demand for water, can be got rid of for a few hours, or even\r\nmore, without a breach occurring.\r\n\r\nEscapes at outlets, in connection with modules, can be arranged by means\r\nof waste weirs or by means of Gregotti’s syphons (_sifoni\r\nautolivelatori_). The following is an abridged translation of part of a\r\npamphlet by Gregotti:--\r\n\r\n  The figure represents one of the syphons installed in the “Centrali\r\n  Milani.”\r\n\r\n  A is the supply basin of the “Centrali,” which ends in the syphon B.\r\n  The latter is constructed with mouthpiece of rectangular section _a_,\r\n  which is submerged in the basin A. A weir divides the mouthpiece of\r\n  the syphon from the descending branch, _c_, of the same, also\r\n  rectangular in section. The weir crest is at level _dd_, from 2 to 7\r\n  cm. below the maximum level of water surface which it is desired not\r\n  to exceed in the supply basin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\n  The descending branch, _c_, has at its base a small tank _e_, which\r\n  forms a water seal. The syphon is completed by a tube _f_, which is\r\n  attached to the intake branch of the syphon and which ends at a level\r\n  of 2 to 7 cm. above the previously mentioned surface _dd_.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the water surface in the supply basin tends to rise above\r\n  the plane _dd_, a filament of water, in falling over the weir _b_,\r\n  pours down the descending branch _c_, and when the water has risen\r\n  from 2 to 7 cm. above the crest of the weir, the thickness of the\r\n  falling stream has become such that it is able, by lapping, with a\r\n  wave-like course, the wall _gg_, to extract the air that has become\r\n  enclosed in the syphon, and which cannot be replaced because the space\r\n  in which the stream acts is closed at its base by the water in the\r\n  tank _e_; and at the top also the aeration tube is closed by the rise\r\n  in the water surface of the supply basin. From this point the syphon\r\n  action quickly becomes fully established and begins to give its full\r\n  discharge.\r\n\r\n  The discharge that is given is equal to that of an orifice in a thin\r\n  partition if certain limitations are allowed for between the fall used\r\n  in the syphon and the height of the arch, that is, the distance from\r\n  the crest of the weir to the inside roof of the syphon.\r\n\r\n  The discharge is given by the formula\r\n\r\n  Q = μA√(2_g h_).\r\n\r\n  Q = discharge of syphon in cubic metres per sec.\r\n\r\n  μ = a coefficient of reduction of discharge which varies between wide\r\n  limits.\r\n\r\n  A = the minimum cross-sectional area of the syphon in square metres.\r\n\r\n  _g_ = value of acceleration due to gravity.\r\n\r\n  _h_ = the fall, or the difference of level in metres between the water\r\n  surfaces in the supply basin A and in the small tank _e_.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the supply basin surface falls, the opening of the aeration\r\n  tube becomes uncovered and air is drawn into the syphon. But until the\r\n  surface has fallen some centimetres the supply of air is not\r\n  sufficient to cause the syphon action to stop completely, and thus the\r\n  escape varies gradually from the maximum discharge to zero as the\r\n  water surface falls a few centimetres till it reaches its original\r\n  level.\r\n\r\n  In certain cases it is possible to do without the aeration tube,\r\n  especially when the fall used in the syphon is not great and when it\r\n  is possible to arrange matters so that the velocity of the water\r\n  flowing past in front of the syphon is small.\r\n\r\n  The syphon with a width of 3 metres escapes 8 cubic metres per sec. of\r\n  water.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX G.\r\n\r\nGAUGES.\r\n\r\n(See Chap. III., Arts. 2 and 3; also see _Hydraulics_, Chap. VIII., Art.\r\n5, and Appendix H.)\r\n\r\n1. The gauge should be placed on that bank and facing in that direction\r\nwhich enables it to be most conveniently read by the gauge reader and by\r\nofficials passing the place.\r\n\r\n2. The gauge should be of enamelled iron secured by copper screws to a\r\npost of squared and seasoned wood which is either driven beforehand[64]\r\ninto the channel or spiked to a masonry work. Even in the deepest\r\nchannel a long enough post can be arranged for. A masonry pillar is not\r\nnecessary. The post may be rectangular in cross-section, with upstream\r\nand downstream edges cut sharp. This prevents, or greatly reduces, the\r\nheaping up of water at the upstream side and the formation of a hollow\r\ndownstream. If the “Ward” gauge of two vertical planks is used, the\r\nplanks should meet at an acute angle, not a right angle, and not be\r\nwider than 7 inches each.\r\n\r\n  [64] Driving after the gauge is attached may loosen or break the\r\n  screws.\r\n\r\n3. The top of the gauge should be slightly above the highest probable\r\nwater-level. The post should extend up to the top of the gauge.\r\n\r\n4. If ever the graded bed of the channel is altered the zero of the\r\ngauge should be altered. There may be some risk of confusion at first,\r\nbut it can be avoided by exercising due care and making notes. The\r\nlevels of the old and new zeros should be recorded.\r\n\r\n5. A gauge at a distance from the bank is objectionable. It collects\r\njungle, cannot be properly read, and is liable to be damaged by floating\r\nlogs or boats. A gauge should be as near as possible to one bank or the\r\nother. If the bank is vertical, the gauge should be quite close to it.\r\nIf, owing to silt deposit, the gauge is dry at low supply, the deposit\r\ncan be removed by the gauge reader.\r\n\r\n6. Every regulator should be given a name, generally that of a\r\nneighbouring village and not that of a channel, and the gauge book\r\nheadings should be drawn up in an intelligent and systematic manner.\r\nEach main channel should be entered in order, and each regulator on the\r\nchannel--together with the head gauges of all channels which take off\r\nthere--should be entered, commencing from upstream. A specimen is given\r\non page 109. Thus the head gauge of any branch appears in the register\r\nof the main channel from which it takes off, other gauges on the branch\r\nappearing in the register for the branch. And similarly as regards a\r\ndistributary which has gauges other than the head gauge.\r\n\r\n7. Each gauge reader should be supplied with a register, each page\r\nhaving, besides the counterfoil, as many detachable slips--marked off by\r\nperforations--as there are officials--usually the Subdivisional Officer,\r\nzilladar and suboverseer--to whom daily gauge reports are to be sent.\r\nThe titles and addresses of these officials are printed on the backs of\r\nthe respective slips. The slips and counterfoil have printed on them a\r\nform--similar to part of the specimen shown on page 109--showing the\r\nnames of all the gauges read by that particular gauge reader, so that\r\nhe has merely to fill in the date and readings, tear off the slips and\r\ndespatch them. The posting of the register in the subdivision is\r\nfacilitated if each gauge has a number and if the corresponding numbers\r\nare printed--besides the names--on the gauge slips. If the gauge reader\r\ndoes not know English, the headings of the slips are printed in the\r\nvernacular. If the gauge readings are telegraphed, there may be only one\r\nslip--besides the counterfoil--which is sent to the telegraph\r\nsignaller.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX H.\r\n\r\nGIBB’S MODULE.[65]\r\n\r\n(See p. 164.)\r\n\r\n  [65] This description has been supplied by Glenfield & Kennedy,\r\n  Kilmarnock. The modules can, it is understood, be obtained from them.\r\n\r\nThe attributes of a perfect module are many and varied, but in Gibb’s\r\nmodule they have all been successfully embodied in what is probably the\r\nsimplest piece of apparatus of its kind ever devised. The following\r\nsummary of the characteristics of Gibb’s module is, therefore,\r\nequivalent to an enumeration of the attributes of a perfect module:--\r\n\r\n  Gibb’s module\r\n\r\n  Cannot be tampered with,                }\r\n  Cannot get out of order,                } since it has no moving\r\n  Silt or other solid matter in the water } parts, and because of its\r\n  cannot affect its action,               } extreme simplicity.\r\n  Requires no attention,                  }\r\n\r\n  It is accurate,                     } being designed on scientific\r\n  Works with very small loss of head, } hydraulic principles.\r\n\r\n  It is portable, and can be erected at any desired site very simply and\r\n  easily.\r\n\r\n  It is strong and durable.\r\n\r\n  The range of variation of both up- and downstream water-levels through\r\n  which the discharge remains constant is more than sufficient to meet\r\n  all the requirements of irrigation canals.\r\n\r\n  The sufficiency of the delivery can be ascertained at a glance.\r\n\r\n  The water can be drawn from any desired depth in the parent channel.\r\n\r\n  When desired, means are provided whereby the supply can be closed or\r\n  opened at will.\r\n\r\n  Means are provided, if desired, for a sudden increase of discharge\r\n  when the upstream water-level exceeds a certain limit, so that surplus\r\n  water, which might endanger the safety of the canal, is allowed to\r\n  escape into the branch whenever the danger limit is reached. The\r\n  upstream water-level at which escapement begins can be fixed in\r\n  accordance with the requirements of each site, and the action of the\r\n  escape notch is independent of the opening and closing of the module.\r\n\r\n  No designing or calculations are required. These have already been\r\n  worked out. Known the discharge required, the module is supplied\r\n  complete and ready for setting in position in the canal bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDRAULIC PRINCIPLE.\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of moving parts is the chief feature of Gibb’s\r\nmodule; the water simply regulates itself by using up all the excess of\r\nenergy over and above that required to discharge the correct supply of\r\nwater. The way in which this takes place will be understood from the\r\nfollowing analogy:--\r\n\r\nWe all know that when we stir tea in a cup so as to make it spin, the\r\nliquid rises at the rim of the cup and curves down into a depression in\r\nthe middle, and the greater the spin the more marked this effect is. It\r\nis, we know, the centrifugal force produced by the spin that makes the\r\ntea remain high at the rim of the cup. If, while the tea is thus\r\nspinning, a teaspoon is held so that it dips slightly below the surface\r\nof the liquid near the rim, it will obstruct the flow of the outer\r\nportion of the liquid, which will fall in towards the depression in the\r\nmiddle. The reason for this, of course, is that the centrifugal force is\r\nabsorbed when we interrupt any part of the spin with the teaspoon; hence\r\nthe liquid must fall, and we know that when liquid falls it uses up\r\n“head” or energy.\r\n\r\nIn Gibb’s module a similar action is made to take place in a steel\r\nchamber, semicircular or spiral in plan, through which the water flows\r\nin a semicircular path instead of circulating round and round as in the\r\nteacup. The surface of the stream, however, assumes the same form as it\r\ndoes in a cup, because it flows under the same conditions. Across the\r\nchamber are fixed a number of vertical steel diaphragm plates which take\r\nthe place of the teaspoon in the above analogy. The lower edges of these\r\nplates are of such a shape, and they are fixed at such a height from the\r\nbottom of the chamber, as to allow a stream of just the correct required\r\ndischarge of water to flow under them without interference. But if,\r\nowing to an increase of head caused by a rise in the upstream\r\nwater-level, the water tends to rise higher at the circumference of the\r\nchamber, then the water at the surface of the stream strikes against the\r\ndiaphragm plates, and its centrifugal force being absorbed, it will fall\r\nin towards the centre just as happened in the teacup when the spoon was\r\nused in place of these plates. In this way the excess head that caused\r\nthe additional rise of water at the circumference is used up by the fall\r\nback towards the centre. The full capacity of the semicircle or spiral\r\nfor using up excess head or energy in this way is made available by the\r\nuse of a sufficient number of diaphragm plates fixed at suitable\r\nintervals. When the range of head to be dealt with is not large, then a\r\nsemicircular chamber is sufficient; but for large ranges of head the\r\nchamber is made of spiral form so as to lead the water round a complete\r\nrevolution or more, as may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL DETAILS.\r\n\r\nFig. 29 shows the general form and structure of the type of module\r\nsuitable for irrigation. Fig. 30 is from a photograph.\r\n\r\nThe working chamber or shell A is constructed of mild steel plating\r\nsecurely riveted to a framework of angle steel, and the semicircular\r\nform of the shell with the rigid diaphragm plates B B riveted to the\r\nwalls makes a very strong structure, and ensures durability.\r\n\r\nThe “leading-in” bend C is of cast iron strongly bolted to the steel\r\nshell, and is so designed as to deliver the water into the module\r\nchamber in a completely established vortex condition.\r\n\r\nThe socket D on this “leading-in” bend is made so as to allow of\r\nconsiderable latitude in the vertical alignment of the straight\r\nleading-in pipe, so that the water can be drawn from any desired depth\r\nin the parent channel, and the proportion of silt drawn off is thus\r\nbrought under control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: -- END ELEVATION. --\r\n\r\n-- PLAN. --\r\n\r\n-- FRONT ELEVATION. --\r\n\r\nFIG. 29.--Details of Gibb’s Patent Module.]\r\n\r\nGrooves E E and a shutter F, as illustrated, for closing off the flow\r\nthrough the module, are provided, if required, but all modules are not\r\nfitted in this way, because many irrigation authorities consider it\r\nundesirable to provide the consumers with unrestricted facilities for\r\nclosing off their supplies without previously giving notice of such an\r\naction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--The Completed Module (Open Type for Low\r\nHeads).]\r\n\r\nAn escape notch H is provided in the position indicated when desired. It\r\nmay, however, be found difficult to determine beforehand the upstream\r\nwater-level at which it is necessary to allow this escape of surplus\r\nsupply, so that it is generally more satisfactory to cut the escape\r\nnotch after the modules have been installed and actual experience has\r\nindicated a suitable level for the notch crest.\r\n\r\nIn the standard type of module for irrigation purposes the top of the\r\nmodule chamber is completely open, as shown, and this is the type\r\ngenerally recommended, as it is found that consumers have greater\r\nconfidence in an apparatus which hides nothing from them. To meet the\r\nneeds of special cases, however, a second type is also made in which the\r\nchamber is completely closed and considerably reduced in height, being\r\nthus specially suitable for sites where space is confined.\r\n\r\nPipes I, of diameter suitable for all sizes of modules, are also\r\nsupplied. These may either be welded steel or cast iron, as desired. An\r\n18-feet length of pipe is usually found sufficient to bring the supply\r\nthrough the canal bank to the module.\r\n\r\nAll modules supplied are treated with anti-corrosive paint, which\r\nensures the protection of the metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX K.\r\n\r\nKENNEDY’S GAUGE OUTLET.[66]\r\n\r\n(See p. 168.)\r\n\r\n  [66] See _Punjab Irrigation Branch Paper No. 12_, “Results of Tests of\r\n  Kennedy’s Gauge Outlet.”\r\n\r\nFIG. 31 shows a bell-mouthed orifice discharging into an air-space. The\r\njet springs across the air-space and traverses a gradually diverging\r\ntube. Let _a_, A be the sectional areas of the stream at the air-space\r\nand the downstream end of the tube respectively, and let V, _v_, and\r\nP_ₐ_, P₁ be the corresponding velocities and pressures. Let resistances\r\nbe neglected. Since the pressure in the air-space is P_ₐ_,\r\n\r\n  V = √(2_g h_₀)\r\n\r\nor the discharge through the tube depends only on _h_₀ and not on _h_₁.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nBy Bernouilli’s theorem,\r\n\r\n   V²    P_ₐ_   _v_²   P₁\r\n  ---- + ---- = ----- + --\r\n  2_g_     W    2_g_    W\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n  P₁ - P_ₐ_   V² - _v_²\r\n  --------- = ---------.\r\n      W          2_g_\r\n\r\nThis quantity (since _v_ is small) is not much less than _h_₀ or\r\nV²/2_g_. In other words, the water levels of two cisterns with an\r\nair-space between them differ only a little, or _h_₁ is small.\r\n\r\nThe above case (two cisterns and air-space) is mentioned in\r\n_Hydraulics_, Chap. V. The principle is simply that the velocity head at\r\nthe air-space is reconverted into pressure head by passing the stream\r\nthrough a gradually diverging tube. In the absence of such a tube the\r\nvelocity head would be wasted by causing eddies in the downstream\r\ncistern.\r\n\r\nIf the downstream cistern is a watercourse whose water-level is\r\nconsiderably lower than that of the upstream cistern or distributary, V\r\nis obviously unaffected. Also P₁ is obviously reduced. Therefore, by\r\nBernouilli, _v_ is increased, or the stream does not fill the expanded\r\ntube and there are eddies in the tube. The water-level in the\r\nwatercourse may even be lower than the end of the tube. The discharge is\r\nunaffected.\r\n\r\nIn practice there are, of course, resistances, but this fact does not\r\naffect the general conclusions stated above. The minimum working head\r\n(difference between the two water-levels) which gives a constant\r\ndischarge is greater than would be the case in the absence of\r\nresistances. This “minimum working head for modularity” has been found\r\nto be ·21 foot, ·42 foot, and ·61 foot, the corresponding values of the\r\n“depression,” _h_₀, being respectively 1 foot, 2 feet, and 3 feet. When\r\nthe working head is less than the above, the discharge is less and it\r\ndepends on the working head. The depression should, according to\r\nKennedy, be about 1·75 feet, but it may be more.\r\n\r\nThe chief difficulty in using the gauge outlet as a module is that the\r\nair vent can be stopped up. This converts the apparatus into a compound\r\ndiverging tube (_Hydraulics_, Chap. III., Art. 17). The discharge is, of\r\ncourse, increased, and it becomes dependent at all times on the working\r\nhead. Another difficulty is that any rise or fall in the water-level of\r\nthe distributary (and such rises and falls may occur owing to silting or\r\nscour, however carefully the discharge may be regulated) alters the\r\ndischarge somewhat, though not to the same degree as in an ordinary\r\noutlet with a working head of, say, ·5 foot. In short, Kennedy’s gauge\r\noutlet, or “semi-module” as it is sometimes called, can modify but not\r\ndo away with the variations of the discharges of outlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n
