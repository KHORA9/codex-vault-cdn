It is notoriously\r\ndifficult to write a small book on a large subject, and I expect there\r\nare many who will detect sins of omission.\r\n\r\nThe book is chiefly concerned with fisheries for edible fish. I have\r\nincluded a chapter on whale fisheries, since whale oil is now used\r\nlargely in the manufacture of such food substances as lard substitute\r\nand margarine. No account of seal “fishing” is included, as seals are\r\nnot fished but are generally hunted on shore. I have not included\r\nfisheries for pearls, sponges or seaweed. To its cost the nation knows\r\nlittle of the methods and organization and achievements of the Fishing\r\nIndustry. I sincerely hope that this little book may do something to\r\nstimulate a wider and deeper interest in this vitally important British\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy cordial thanks are due to Mr. J.

In both cases man became skilled in harvesting long\r\nbefore he understood anything of the art of cultivation. Primitive\r\nman roamed from place to place in the wake of the annual wave of\r\nharvest, gathering wild crops of grain, berries and fruits. Ultimately\r\nhe became alive to the significance of seed, and the nomad settled\r\ndown to raise crops year after year in the same place. Gradually he\r\nacquired a knowledge of the conditions of temperature, moisture, and\r\nquality of soil that favoured the growth of his plants. Finally, he\r\ndiscovered the principle of the rotation of crops, and, by this,\r\nnot only increased the productivity of his land but also laid the\r\nfoundations of a systematic agriculture. Of recent years agriculture\r\nhas been rapidly developing into a science. Chemistry, physics, botany,\r\nplant physiology, and bacteriology, all contribute increasingly to a\r\nfull understanding of the inner processes of the growing plant, and\r\nindicate more and more clearly the exact relations that exist between\r\nthe conditions of growth and the character and amount of the resulting\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThe art of fishing is one of the oldest in the world, yet even to this\r\nday the fisherman is simply a hunter, gathering where he has not sown,\r\nand differing little, save in mechanical efficiency, from his primitive\r\nancestor fishing with spear and trap.\r\n\r\nOnly in recent years has any systematic attempt been made to understand\r\nsomething of the forces that produce the annual harvest of the sea. We\r\nknow very little about the habits of the various fishes that constitute\r\nthis harvest—their food, their migrations, their reproductive\r\nprocesses, and, in general, the conditions upon which their healthy\r\nlife and development depend. We have developed highly efficient fishing\r\nimplements, but we have yet to learn to use them wisely and not too\r\nwell; to increase the fertility of the various fishing grounds rather\r\nthan depopulate them by over-fishing and the destruction of immature\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nThe fisherman’s harvest differs from that of the farmer in one\r\nimportant respect. Fishes grow for three or four, or more, years before\r\nthey are mature. Now, only mature fish as a rule have any considerable\r\ncommercial value, and only mature fish are able to reproduce their kind\r\nand so maintain the existence of the fishery. On the fishing grounds,\r\nboth mature and immature fish are mingled together, and in capturing\r\nthe one it is practically impossible to avoid netting the other. To\r\nsome extent the capture of immature fish is avoided by making the\r\nmesh of the net of such a size that the smaller fish can escape. With\r\ndrift nets only mature fish are caught, the small ones escaping; but\r\nwith trawl nets it is otherwise. The trawl net is essentially a large\r\nstring bag that is drawn open-mouthed along the sea bottom, scooping\r\nup wholesale all bottom-living fish, such as cod, haddock, sole and\r\nplaice. All go into the net, both large and small, and, although the\r\nyoung fish ultimately escape through the meshes, many of them are\r\ndamaged in so doing, while many young, flat fish, lying on the sea\r\nbottom, are damaged by the foot rope of the net, as it passes over\r\nthem. Certain fishing grounds, such as the Dogger Bank, were almost\r\ndepopulated of flat fish in the years just previous to the war.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the future of the fisheries, the trawl, can only be\r\nworked on smooth ground, and at depths not exceeding two hundred and\r\nfifty fathoms, so that only a small percentage of the actual fishing\r\ngrounds is affected by it. Also, when a fishing ground shows signs of\r\nbecoming exhausted by over-fishing, it is less frequented by fishermen,\r\nowing to the reduced catches that can be obtained, and thus it tends\r\nautomatically to recover. Nevertheless, it is desirable that fishing\r\nshould be so organized and restrained, that the fertility of the\r\nfishing grounds is not imperilled. In the distant future it may become\r\npossible to re-stock partially exhausted grounds with young fish,\r\nartificially reared in a hatchery.\r\n\r\nOceanography—the study of the ocean and its inhabitants—is one of\r\nthe youngest of sciences. Yet, to an island people such as we are,\r\nit should be one of the most important, for it is only by the study\r\nof oceanography that we can hope to found a systematic, organized\r\naquiculture.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of a simple aquiculture is to be seen in the cultivation\r\nof shellfish, such as oysters and mussels, by the inshore fishermen.\r\n\r\nOf recent years, experiments have been carried out by the Fishery\r\nBoards of England, Scotland, Germany, and the United States of America,\r\nwith the object of increasing the productivity of certain fishing\r\ngrounds by adding large numbers of artificially hatched, young fish.\r\nFor some years the Fishery Board for Scotland added annually about\r\ntwenty million plaice larvae to certain confined sea areas (Upper Loch\r\nFyne), and found, as a result, that the number of young plaice on the\r\nshallow beaches was doubled.\r\n\r\nIn some cases a new species of fish has been introduced into a\r\nparticular fishing ground, with marked success. Thus the U.S.A.\r\nfisheries collected and hatched the eggs of the shad on the Atlantic\r\ncoast and introduced the larvae into the Pacific, with the result that\r\na profitable shad fishery has now been established on the Californian\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThe application of science to the fishing industry is not restricted to\r\nbiological investigations of the food, habits and development of living\r\nfishes. It is developing new processes for the better preservation of\r\nedible fish for food purposes, so that the large quantities of fish\r\ncaught periodically—for example, in the summer herring fishery—may be\r\nstored up for gradual consumption during the winter. It has shown that\r\nfish waste can be manufactured into glue, cattle food, and fertilizers.\r\nIt has developed into a profitable industry the extraction of oils from\r\nboth edible and inedible fish, and the conversion of these oils into\r\nhard fats, suitable for the manufacture of soap and margarine. It has\r\ndemonstrated that the skins of certain fish, notably the shark, can be\r\ntanned to make excellent leather.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these pioneer experiments and investigations,\r\nhowever, the fishing industry of to-day is simply an organized art—the\r\nart of catching wild fish. The story of the industry is essentially\r\na description of the methods that are used for capturing the various\r\nspecies of fish that are of commercial importance, and for handling,\r\ncuring, and disposing of the catch.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain is situated in the midst of the greatest fishing grounds\r\nof the world. The British fishing industry is the most efficient and\r\nthe most highly developed of any. Consequently, since fishing methods\r\nare essentially the same everywhere, it will be sufficient for us to\r\nconsider, with few exceptions, the methods and equipment that are used\r\nby our own fishermen around our own shores.\r\n\r\nThere is direct evidence that, as early as the third century, A.D.,\r\nfish were caught in considerable quantities round the coast of Britain\r\nby the natives and used as food. Little is known about the early\r\ndevelopment of a fishing industry in this country. We know that in\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, fish was in demand throughout\r\nthe country, partly because of the religious observance of fast days,\r\nand partly, no doubt, because it afforded a welcome change in the\r\nregular winter diet of salted meat. In those days there was no winter\r\nroot crop, so that cattle were killed in autumn and salted down for\r\nconsumption during the winter.\r\n\r\nIn disposing of their catch, the fishermen were handicapped by the\r\nalmost complete lack of transport facilities from the coast inland.\r\nTheir produce would be distributed by pack-horse, so that fresh fish\r\nwould be practically unknown beyond a distance of a few miles from the\r\ncoast. Consequently, all fish for inland markets were salted. The fish\r\nwere pickled in brine, as the art of dry-salting was then unknown in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nTo develop a successful fishing industry, it was necessary, then, as\r\nit is to-day, either to dispose of the catch quickly on the spot,\r\nor to preserve the fish so that it could be transported to distant\r\nmarkets. In 1347, a Dutchman, William Beukels, of Biervelt, invented an\r\nimproved means of curing and pickling herring, which was essentially\r\nthe modern process of gutting the fish and packing them in dry salt.\r\nAt this time the Baltic herring fishery, carried on by the Hanseatic\r\nLeague, dominated the markets of Europe. But the new method of curing,\r\nexploited by the Dutch, improved the quality and keeping powers of\r\nthe fish to such an extent that, by the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe Dutch fishing industry was supreme, and had become a powerful and\r\nvaluable national enterprise. In the sixteenth century, as many as\r\ntwo thousand Dutch herring “busses” (as the boats were called) would\r\ngather on St. John’s day at Brassa Sound, in the Shetlands, to begin\r\nthe summer herring fishery. The fish were caught with drift nets, were\r\nsalted and packed in barrels, and carried home by the fast-sailing,\r\nattendant “yaggers.” Ashore they were repacked in fresh salt in new\r\nbarrels. Over a million barrels were packed in a year. When caught,\r\nthe fish would be worth about a million pounds, and when retailed\r\nabout two million pounds. Contemporary illustrations of the methods of\r\ncuring and salting then in use reveal the astonishing fact that even\r\nto the smallest detail the methods that were employed in Holland in\r\nElizabeth’s day are identical with those that are employed at Yarmouth\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nAs a direct result of the great development of their trade in salted\r\nherrings, the Dutch gradually gained a naval and maritime supremacy\r\nin Europe which they maintained until it was wrested from them by the\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nEnglish sea-power in the early years of the sixteenth century was in a\r\ndecadent condition. The ports and harbours had been neglected, and had\r\nbecome silted up, so that the condition of the shipping industry in\r\ngeneral, and of the Navy in particular, had reached a very low ebb. In\r\n1561, Mr. Secretary Cecil, alarmed by the growing menace of the Dutch\r\nnaval ascendancy, proposed three remedies for restoring the strength\r\nand importance of the navy. He proposed:\r\n\r\n(1) That the fishing industry be promoted, as it provided a valuable\r\nrecruiting ground for the navy;\r\n\r\n(2) That merchandise be extended, and so provide increased employment\r\nfor the shipping industry;\r\n\r\n(3) That piracy be encouraged, privately-owned privateers forming\r\nvaluable auxiliaries in time of war.\r\n\r\nHe thought that the fishing industry could be stimulated immediately\r\nby renewing the fast days, which had fallen into disuse since the\r\nabolition of the monasteries.\r\n\r\nHe suggested that two days a week—Wednesday and Friday—should be\r\nmeatless days.\r\n\r\nIn 1563, he tried a measure of Protection, a Navigation Act being\r\npassed, making it illegal to buy or sell foreign-caught fish, and\r\nattempts were made to prevent Dutch and other foreigners from fishing\r\nin English waters. These measures, although passed by Parliament, do\r\nnot appear to have been enforced.\r\n\r\nJames I issued two proclamations, imposing licences and dues upon\r\nforeign fishing vessels fishing in British waters. No attention was\r\npaid to these, and it was left to Charles I, some years later, to\r\nenforce them. Other steps taken by both Charles I and Charles II\r\nconsisted mainly in the formation of Royal Fishery Companies. Various\r\nfishery companies and societies succeeded one another up to the end\r\nof the eighteenth century. They do not appear to have been successful\r\nin establishing a flourishing fishing industry, and in 1718 (George\r\nI) an act was passed by which fishermen were to be rewarded for their\r\ncatch by a bounty. Bounties were to be paid for several kinds of fish:\r\nthus, for every barrel of white herrings of 32 gallons, exported beyond\r\nthe seas, the bounty was 2s. 8d.; for full red herrings, 1s. 9d. per\r\nbarrel; for empty red herrings, 1s. per barrel.\r\n\r\nThe conditions upon which the bounty was to be paid were fully set\r\nforth in a later act in 1750 (George II). The construction of herring\r\nvessels was encouraged by a bounty of 30s. per ton, paid out of the\r\nCustoms, for decked fishing vessels of from twenty to eighty tons.\r\n\r\nThe time and place of fishing were stipulated, as well as rules for the\r\nproper management and prosecution of the fishery. Each vessel was to\r\nhave on board twelve Winchester bushels of salt for every last of fish\r\nsuch vessel was capable of holding, the salt to be contained in new\r\nbarrels.\r\n\r\nIn 1757, the bounty was increased to 50s. per ton, but was reduced to\r\n30s. again in 1771. It was further reduced to 20s. in 1787, and an\r\nadditional bounty of 4s. per barrel added. This was made proportional\r\nto the tonnage, so that no vessel could claim more than 30s. per\r\nton—unless the vessel caught over three barrels per ton, in which case\r\na bounty of 1s. per barrel was granted upon the surplus quantity.\r\n\r\nWhile the bounty often undoubtedly encouraged the development of the\r\nfishery, the development was not so rapid or so extensive as it would\r\notherwise have been, owing to the duty on imported salt. The weight of\r\nthe duty was such that the fishermen threw fish overboard rather than\r\ncure it, only landing that which could be brought in fresh.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 the bounty was raised to £3 per ton on every British built and\r\nBritish owned fishing boat of not less than sixty tons burden, properly\r\nmanned, registered, and navigated and employed in herring fishing. The\r\nmaximum tonnage on which the bounty was payable was one hundred tons.\r\nTwo shillings per barrel was paid on properly cured and packed herrings.\r\n\r\nAfter the peace of 1815, the naval wars and the press gangs had reduced\r\nthe sea fisheries to negligible proportions, but the existing bounties\r\nwere continued until 1829, and encouraged the rapid revival of the\r\nindustry. By 1829, the fishing industry was well established, and\r\nthereafter steadily developed in value and importance.\r\n\r\nThe modern organization and development of the fishing industry began\r\nbetween 1870 and 1880, following the introduction of steam fishing\r\nvessels. The old sailing smacks and drifters were necessarily limited\r\nin their scope and capacity. They could only fish in certain weathers;\r\nthey required skilled handling; their effective area of operation was\r\nrestricted by the necessity for bringing the catch ashore as fresh as\r\npossible; their trawling power depended upon the wind.\r\n\r\nA sail boat was generally the property of a small family group\r\nof fishermen, who worked the boat and fished, while one of their\r\nnumber—the ship’s husband—stayed ashore to purchase stores and tackle,\r\nand dispose of the catch. The proceeds of the boat were shared among\r\nthe owners. These privately owned sail boats were to be found in every\r\nlittle harbour on every coast of Britain. The fishermen themselves were\r\na fine, sturdy, independent class of men, skilful seamen, and all-round\r\nfishermen, able to turn their hands to any form of fishing, whether\r\nlining, trawling, or drifting.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of steam trawlers and drifters has completely changed\r\nthe character and organization of the fishing industry. Instead of\r\nbeing individualistic, it has become collective, and instead of being\r\nthe common industry of every seaside village, it has become controlled\r\nby large limited liability companies, and centralized in a few large\r\nports.\r\n\r\nSteamers were first used in 1870, to collect the catch from the sail\r\nboats on the fishing grounds, bringing it home with all speed while\r\nthe fishing boats remained at sea. This naturally enabled the fishing\r\nboats to catch more fish, and also made possible the use of larger\r\nboats fishing further afield. A logical development of this step was\r\nthe construction of actual steam-driven fishing boats—trawlers and\r\ndrifters. These steamers soon proved to be superior to the sail boats.\r\nThey were able to fish in all weathers, even in a calm. Owing to their\r\ngreater power, also, they were able to use much larger nets and fish in\r\ndeeper waters.\r\n\r\nSteam trawlers and drifters are much more expensive than smacks or\r\nsailing drifters. They can only be berthed and handled satisfactorily\r\nin harbours that are equipped for the unloading and dispatching of\r\nlarge quantities of fish. From the very beginning these steamers were\r\nowned by large limited companies rather than by individuals, and the\r\nindustry has tended to become more and more centralized at certain\r\nlarge ports, for example, Aberdeen, Hull, Grimsby, Yarmouth, Lowestoft,\r\nMilford Haven, and Fleetwood. The rise and development of many of these\r\nports, for example, Aberdeen and Fleetwood, has been in direct response\r\nto the demands made upon them by the new steam fishing industry.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of steam fishing made longer voyages possible, and led\r\nto the development of new fishing grounds. Steam trawlers from British\r\nports now fish as far north as Iceland and the White Sea, as far west\r\nas Newfoundland, and as far south as Morocco, making voyages of many\r\nweek’s duration.\r\n\r\nThe re-organization of the fishing industry led to specialization\r\namongst the fishermen themselves. The old sailing fisherman was\r\nessentially an all-round man. He was equally expert at lining, drifting\r\nand trawling. The skipper of a steamer, however, is a specialist; he\r\nis either a liner-, a drifter-, or a trawler-man. Generally, also, he\r\nkeeps to a given region—Iceland, the White Sea, the North of Scotland,\r\nthe North Sea, or the Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\nIn the three years preceding the war (1911 to 1914) the development\r\nof the steam fishing industry had become almost stationary. This\r\nwas probably due in part to over-capitalization, resulting in lower\r\nprofits. It was feared also that the greatly increased efficiency of\r\nthe steam trawlers tended to produce a condition of over-fishing in\r\ncertain areas, with the result that catches obtained in those areas\r\nprogressively diminished; for example, the average catch per boat per\r\nday in the North Sea during three successive periods was as follows—\r\n\r\n  1903 to 1906    17·2 cwts.\r\n  1907 to 1910    16·7   „\r\n  1911 to 1913    15·3   „\r\n\r\nThe fishermen became alarmed and development was arrested. This\r\ntendency to over-fish certain grounds has been effectively checked\r\nduring the war by the almost complete cessation of offshore fishing.\r\nThere is thus every probability that such grounds have now recovered,\r\nand further that, in many cases, grounds such as the Dogger Bank, that\r\nhad become almost depopulated, will have become restocked.\r\n\r\nThe successful development of steam fishing has necessarily reacted\r\nupon the prosperity of the individual fishermen in the various fishing\r\nvillages, with their smaller, privately-owned sail boats. They were\r\nfaced with two alternatives: either to combine together to acquire\r\nsteamers, and so maintain their position in the offshore fisheries,\r\nor to devote their attention to the development of inshore fishing.\r\nMany of the larger sailing drifters have now been fitted with petrol\r\nengines, which make it possible for them to compete with the steam\r\ndrifters for herring and mackerel.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, however, the outlook for the small fishermen\r\nof the English and Scottish coast villages—the real fisher folk—is\r\ndiscouraging. The tendency of legislation, however, just before the war\r\nwas to encourage this class of fishermen by restricting the operations\r\nof the steam trawlers in certain localities. In 1910-1914, with the\r\nobject of protecting the inshore fishermen, the Fishery Board of\r\nScotland prohibited trawling in the Moray Firth area, only drifting\r\nand lining being permitted. Since this prohibition only applied to\r\nBritish subjects, certain East Coast fishing companies evaded it by\r\ntransferring their vessels to foreign flags, registering them in a\r\nforeign port and employing a foreigner as a dummy skipper. The Board\r\nsecured convictions against these offenders in the Sheriff’s Court,\r\nbut the convictions were upset subsequently by the Foreign Office. The\r\noriginal prohibition was then strengthened by a new law which made it\r\nillegal to land fish in Scotland, if caught by vessels registered in a\r\nforeign port.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, the inshore fisherman found himself in a comparatively\r\nadvantageous position, as the high price of coal made steam fishing\r\nless profitable. Further, the offshore trawling grounds were mostly\r\nclosed, and the majority of the steam trawlers and drifters were on\r\nwar-service. For the time being, therefore, inshore fishing with smacks\r\nwas placed at an advantage.\r\n\r\nA number of fishermen’s co-operative societies were formed to organize\r\nthe sale and distribution of the produce of these inshore fisheries.\r\nThis also tended to make the position of the inshore fisherman more\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nThe old order changeth, and although there is that connected with this\r\ntransformation in the fishing industry which is to be regretted, yet,\r\non the whole, the developments of the past forty years have undoubtedly\r\ntransformed the fishing industry into a very efficient and valuable\r\nnational asset. Individually, the present-day steam fisherman is very\r\nmuch inferior to his sailing predecessor. The centralization of the\r\nindustry in a few big ports, although undoubtedly making for much\r\ngreater efficiency, bears hardly on the type of the old class of expert\r\nfishermen; but these are the almost inevitable consequences of such a\r\ntransition.\r\n\r\nBut what is the present condition of the industry, and what is its\r\nfuture likely to be? The prosperity of the inshore fisherman, as well\r\nas that of his offshore rival, is vitally important to the welfare\r\nof this country; there should be room and opportunity enough for\r\nboth. The inshore fisherman, protected by legislation and secured\r\nby well-organized co-operation, can increase very considerably the\r\namount of our available home-grown food supply. The superior power and\r\nequipment of the big steam trawlers and drifters, properly utilized and\r\nencouraged, should be one of the most valuable industrial assets of the\r\nState. We are not a great food-producing nation; on the contrary, in\r\nthe years before the war, we actually imported more than 40 per cent of\r\nour total food requirements. We are surrounded by seas that teem with\r\nevery form of edible fish. British enterprise has built up a fishing\r\nindustry which is the greatest and most efficient in the world. In\r\n1914, our fishing boats were practically equal in numbers and equipment\r\nto those of all the other countries in North-West Europe put together.\r\nNearly 70 per cent of the fishing boats in the North Sea were British.\r\nThe total produce of our sea fisheries has nearly doubled since the\r\nbeginning of the century. The annual catch in the last few years before\r\nthe war averaged over a million tons. It was worth about fifteen\r\nmillion pounds when landed, and may be valued at nearly fifty million\r\npounds by the time it reached the consumers. Of all this splendid food\r\nthat is obtained at our very doors by our own people, less than half\r\nis retained for consumption in this country. Out of 600,000 tons of\r\nherrings landed annually in this country before the war, over 500,000\r\nwere exported, chiefly to European countries. Herrings have a high\r\nfood value, and contain a large amount of easily digested fat, and\r\nif all the herrings landed in this country were consumed at home, it\r\nwould only allow two herrings a week to each adult individual in all\r\nthe population. An increased home consumption of fish, would effect a\r\ncorresponding saving in imported meat.\r\n\r\nOwing to this remarkably small home demand for fish, the fisherman has\r\nhad to depend upon foreign markets, chiefly Germany, Poland, Russia and\r\nthe Levant. The present adverse rate of exchange with these countries,\r\nand the increased cost of fishing operations, make it impossible for\r\nthe foreign importer to take our fish, except on terms which our\r\nfishermen cannot consider. These markets are therefore closed, and\r\nunless other outlets are found for its produce, the industry will be\r\nthreatened with ruin.\r\n\r\nIn 1920, the Government guaranteed the cure of herrings up to 880,000\r\nbarrels; unfortunately, they were only able to dispose of them in\r\nEuropean markets at a great loss. The Government, therefore, have\r\ndecided this year (1921) to withdraw their guarantee.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that, in view of the present failure of the foreign\r\nmarkets, vigorous steps should be taken to encourage the consumption of\r\nfish in this country, and so preserve this valuable industry from ruin.\r\nA national scheme of development should be inaugurated, having for its\r\nobjects, (1) the systematic exploitation of local and periodic coastal\r\nfisheries; (2) the discovery of methods of preserving for future\r\nconsumption fish that cannot be disposed of just when it is caught; (3)\r\nthe education of the public to use more freely the large supplies of\r\nexcellent fish food that are available at our very doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCHARACTERISTICS AND HABITS OF FISHES\r\n\r\n\r\nFishes are the most primitive vertebrate, i.e. backboned, creatures\r\nknown. All reptiles, birds, and animals have gradually evolved from\r\nfish-like ancestors by a series of age-long processes, the stages of\r\nwhich are recorded in fossilized remains that are found in various\r\nrock strata throughout the world. A fish lives exclusively in water.\r\nIt has no lungs, but extracts oxygen from the water as it passes over\r\nthe surface of its gills. Instead of limbs, it has fins, with which\r\nit balances itself and propels itself through the water. Its skin is\r\neither bare, e.g. the cat fish, or is covered with scales, e.g. the\r\nherring, or with bony plates, e.g. the sturgeon. The skin of certain\r\nsharks is studded with minute teeth and produces, when cured, the\r\nwell-known shagreen leather. In nearly all cases the skin of fishes\r\nis liberally supplied with small glands which constantly produce a\r\nlubricating mucus. This mucus greatly reduces friction between the fish\r\nand the water through which it moves.\r\n\r\nThe body of a fish is adapted to move swiftly and smoothly through\r\nthe water; it is shaped more or less like a torpedo, but this form is\r\ngreatly modified in different species. Certain species of fish living\r\nat the bottom of the sea, for example skates and rays, have become\r\nflattened, as though by a pressure applied vertically downwards.\r\nOthers, for example plaice, flounder, sole, appear to have been\r\nflattened sideways. In the various members of the eel family, the body\r\nis greatly elongated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nThe body of a fish is generally coloured and marked in such a way\r\nthat it becomes practically invisible when seen from above or below,\r\nthe under-surface being silvery white, and the upper surface generally\r\nolive or blackish-green. Sometimes, as in the mackerel, the upper\r\nsurface is mottled, resembling rippled water.\r\n\r\nMost small fish in ponds and streams reflect their surroundings so\r\nwell, and are coloured and marked in such a way, that they are almost\r\ninvisible to the large fish, for example pike, that prey upon them.\r\nGenerally, they reveal their presence by the flash of light reflected\r\nfrom above by their scales, as they turn suddenly to snap at a morsel\r\nof food. In the same way, many predatory fish, e.g. the angler fish,\r\nresemble their surroundings so closely that the fish for which they are\r\nlying in wait swim within easy reach of them without perceiving their\r\ndanger. Many fishes, particularly in tropical waters, are remarkable\r\nfor their bright and gorgeous colouring. It is impossible to preserve\r\nthese colours in their natural brightness after the fish have been\r\ntaken from the water, but amongst the brightly coloured corals, and\r\nanemones and seaweeds, in the crystal clear water of their natural\r\nenvironment, they flit like gorgeous tropical birds in a tropical\r\nforest.\r\n\r\n=Distribution.= Fishes are found in practically every ocean, lake and\r\nriver in the world, with a few notable exceptions, such as the Dead\r\nSea, in which the concentration of salt is too high. They appear to\r\nexist at all depths of water, and have been found in the sea as deep\r\ndown as 2,720 fathoms. Fish living at this depth generally possess\r\nenormous mouths, long, attenuated, soft bodies, and are equipped with\r\nhighly developed phosphorescent organs.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of a particular species appears to depend upon the\r\nsalinity of the water, the temperature of the water, the kind and\r\nquantity of food available and the prevailing intensity of sunlight.\r\nIt is possible to divide fish into four well-defined groups, according\r\nto the salinity of the water in which they are found: (1) Marine fish:\r\nthose that live always in the sea, for example herring, haddock,\r\nshark. (2) Fresh-water fish: those that live always in fresh water,\r\nfor example carp, trout, pike. (3) Many fish live in brackish water,\r\nand appear to be able to accommodate themselves easily to considerable\r\nchanges in salinity, e.g. sticklebacks, gobies, grey mullets and\r\nblennies. Such species naturally are widely distributed; thus, a\r\nparticular kind of grey mullet (_Mugil capito_) is found without any\r\nappreciable difference in form on nearly every coast of the Atlantic\r\nOcean. (4) The fourth group of fish are migratory. Some species, for\r\nexample salmon and shad, live and develop in salt water, but ascend\r\nrivers to spawn, i.e. to lay their eggs, in fresh water. Others, such\r\nas eels and certain pleuronectids, for example the flounder, live and\r\ndevelop in fresh water, and descend rivers to the sea to spawn. Many\r\nfresh water fish, e.g. trout, forsake the large streams in the spring\r\nand ascend small brooks, where the young can be reared in greater\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nOf these different groups or species, the marine fishes are\r\nindustrially by far the most important, for at least two-thirds of\r\nall the fish in the world live in the sea, and the capture of these\r\nsea-fish in enormous quantities constitutes the fishing industry, with\r\nwhich we are concerned.\r\n\r\nThe different species of marine fishes can be divided into three\r\nwell-marked groups, according to their habits and habitats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2\r\n\r\nCOD (_Gadus morrhua_)\r\n\r\n  Length up to 5 ft.; usually caught at about 3 ft.\r\n\r\n  _Food._—Small crustaceans, molluscs, and young fish.\r\n\r\n  _Range._—North of Norway and Iceland to the Bay of Biscay, and\r\n  from Greenland to New York.]\r\n\r\n(1) There are the true deep-sea fishes that live at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, for example cod, haddock, plaice, sole. These are called\r\n“demersal” fish. Fish, like birds, inhabit a medium that is\r\ncontinuous throughout the world. A glance at the map of the world will\r\nshow that the three great oceans—Atlantic, Indian and Pacific—are\r\nunited in the southern hemisphere. In Tertiary times, it is practically\r\ncertain that the Pacific and the Atlantic oceans were also united\r\nat Darien, and that the Mediterranean was united with the Red Sea.\r\nApart, therefore, from differences in local conditions, for example\r\nof temperature and food supply, there is practically no obstacle to\r\nthe world-wide distribution of any particular species of fish. At\r\nthe bottom of the sea, the temperature, the food supply, and the\r\ngeneral conditions of life are singularly uniform all over the world,\r\nconsequently there are no barriers at all to the dispersion of demersal\r\nfish, and we find various species widely distributed in all seas.\r\nDemersal fish, on the whole, are more primitive in type than those that\r\nlive nearer the surface. They have well-developed senses of touch and\r\nsmell by means of which they hunt for their food. They differ markedly\r\nin structure and shape from surface or shallow-water fish, their bodies\r\nbeing designed to resist the greater pressure of deep water. The\r\nbody is generally lean and is enclosed by a wall of muscular fibre.\r\nShallow-water fish, if introduced into deep water, would be crushed\r\ninward by the pressure. Similarly, the deep-living, demersal fish are\r\nunable to accommodate themselves to shallow water and, if placed in it,\r\nsoon become unhealthy. A cod floats helplessly on its side when placed\r\nin shallow water, owing to the dilatation of its swimming bladder. If\r\nthe bladder is pricked it collapses, and the fish is able to regain an\r\nupright position. This is done when cod and other similar demersal fish\r\nare kept alive in sea-water tanks on board ship, to be delivered to\r\nthe markets alive. In Denmark, fish are delivered alive to the shops.\r\nWhen fishes from great depths are brought to the surface, their bodies\r\nbreak into pieces owing to the reduced external pressure, the scales\r\nstart from their skin and the eyes from their sockets.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct types of demersal fish: the “round” and\r\nthe “flat.” The body of a round fish is more or less circular in\r\ncross-section, for example cod, while that of a flat fish is flattened,\r\nfor example sole, ray.\r\n\r\nThe most important edible demersal fish can be classified as follows—\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _Gadidae_—related to the cod.\r\n\r\n  Cod—inhabits northern waters, notably the North of Britain, Iceland\r\n  and Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n  Ling—inhabits northern waters: West of Scotland and Ireland, and\r\n  North towards Iceland and Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n  Haddock—inhabits northern waters. Nearly half the total catch is\r\n  obtained in the North Sea, from the White Sea to the Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\n  Whiting—found in great numbers in the North Sea. It is more coastal\r\n  than the cod or haddock.\r\n\r\n  Hake—found from Norway to the Mediterranean. The greater part of the\r\n  catch is obtained off the south-west of Ireland. Hake is also caught\r\n  off Morocco and in the Bay of Biscay.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _Pleuronectidae_—related to the plaice and sole.\r\n\r\n  Sole—a shallow-water fish, common in the Irish Sea, and particularly\r\n  abundant in southern waters down to Morocco.\r\n\r\n  Plaice—inhabits northern waters—all round Britain and Iceland.\r\n\r\n  Flounder—inhabits estuaries, for example, of the North Sea and the\r\n  Baltic.\r\n\r\n  Halibut—inhabits northern waters. It attains a large size, six feet\r\n  or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3\r\n\r\nLEMON SOLE (_Pleuronectes microcephalus_)\r\n\r\n  Length up to 16 ins.\r\n  _Food._—Small crustaceans and worms.\r\n  _Range._—From North of Europe to the Bay of Biscay.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4\r\n\r\nSKATE (_Raia batis_)\r\n\r\n  Length up to 7 ft.\r\n  _Food._—Crustaceans and molluscs, and fish.\r\n  _Range._—Round the British Isles and along the coast of Western\r\n  Europe.]\r\n\r\n  Turbot—not very abundant. It inhabits the deeper parts of the North\r\n  Sea.\r\n\r\n  Brill—inhabits southern waters, and is fairly abundant.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _Raüdac_.\r\n\r\n  Skates and rays—found all round Britain, more particularly the\r\n  Western area of the English channel.\r\n\r\n(2) The various species of fish that inhabit the surface waters of the\r\nsea are called “pelagic.” They include the herring, mackerel, tunny,\r\nflying fish, sword fish, and many sharks, also various marine mammals,\r\nsuch as whales, grampuses, porpoises, dolphins. Amongst pelagic fish\r\nare included some of the smallest (plankton) as well as some of the\r\nlargest (whales) of all living creatures. Pelagic fish pass their whole\r\nlife swimming at or near the surface. They enter the shallow water\r\noffshore only for prey or, in some cases, periodically to spawn. The\r\nmajority spawn in the open sea, far from land. Unlike demersal fishes,\r\nthe distribution of the different species of pelagic fishes depends\r\nvery much upon local conditions of light, water temperature, and the\r\ncharacter and quantity of food available. They do not hunt their food\r\nindividually to the same extent as demersal fishes, but generally\r\nfilter it from the water as it passes through their gill-openings.\r\nAlthough not so widely dispersed as demersal fish, they are, in\r\nfavourable circumstances, dispersed over large areas by swimming and by\r\nocean currents.\r\n\r\nAll pelagic fish are “round.” With the exception of the mackerel, the\r\nimportant edible pelagic fishes belong to the herring family, and are\r\nknown as the Clupeidae. They include—\r\n\r\n  Herring—found from the White Sea to the Bay of Biscay. It is the\r\n  most abundant of all food fishes.\r\n\r\n  Sprat—found from the North of Europe to the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n  Pilchard—ranges from the English Channel to Madeira and the\r\n  Mediterranean. Skipper “sardines” are young herring, pilchard, and\r\n  brisling.\r\n\r\n  There is also—\r\n\r\n  Mackerel—found from the North Sea to Madeira and the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n(3) The shallow-water of the seashore is inhabited by certain animals\r\n(shellfish) not found elsewhere, including various mollusca, e.g.\r\nmussel, cockle, oyster and periwinkle, and crustacea, e.g. lobster,\r\ncrab, prawn, shrimp. In addition to these, there are various species of\r\nimmature offshore fish, e.g. plaice and dabs. The inhabitants of this\r\nshallow, coastal water are called “littoral” fish. The distribution of\r\nsuch littoral fish depends not only upon the water temperature and the\r\namount of light, but also upon the character of the shore—whether it\r\nis rocky, or soft and sandy—and more especially upon the animal and\r\nvegetable products of the adjacent land, e.g. plants, seaweed, worms.\r\nLittoral fish do not swim very far, but become scattered inadvertently\r\nover considerable distances by currents and other mechanical means.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5\r\n\r\nHERRING (_Clupea harengus_)\r\n\r\n  Length slightly above 12 ins.\r\n\r\n  _Food._—Plankton (_copepoda_).\r\n\r\n  _Range._—From the White Sea to the Bay of Biscay.]\r\n\r\nCertain kinds of shellfish, for example oysters, mussels, cockles,\r\nlive in the sand or attached to the stones or seaweed on the seashore,\r\ngenerally between high and low watermarks. They obtain their food\r\nfrom the water as it streams over their gills. They require adequate\r\nroom for growth and development, and constant irrigation by water\r\ncontaining sufficient floating food. When mussel beds or oyster beds\r\nbecome overcrowded, the fish are ill-nourished, their health is\r\nimpaired and their growth is arrested. It has been shown that, if they\r\nare transferred to new beds, their condition rapidly improves and\r\nultimately they increase considerably in size. All edible shellfish\r\nneed systematic care and attention. Their cultivation by man affords\r\nthe simplest instance of an attempt at a systematic aquiculture.\r\n\r\n=Food.= The surface water of the sea abounds in minute forms of\r\nvegetable and animal life. This vast floating population of microscopic\r\norganisms is called the “plankton.” Just as man and all land animals\r\ndepend ultimately for their food supply upon grass and other\r\ngreen-leaved plants which, under the influence of sunlight, are able\r\nto transform the inorganic constituents of the atmosphere and the soil\r\ninto organic foodstuffs—albumen, fat, carbohydrates—so the minute\r\nunicellular marine plants of the plankton are able, under the influence\r\nof sunlight, to convert the inorganic constituents of their environment\r\ninto fat, albumen and carbohydrate. Upon these minute organisms,\r\ntherefore, directly or indirectly, all marine life depends.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these minute plants, the plankton contains nearly all\r\nforms of marine life at some stage or other of their life history. Fish\r\nare only found in it as eggs, or larvae. Crustacea of all kinds are\r\npresent, and form one of its most important constituents. Crabs and\r\nlobsters spend their larval, free-swimming career among the plankton,\r\nuntil they reach the adult stage and settle down to the bottom. Various\r\nminute crustacea, known as “Copepoda” (lit., oar-footed) spend the\r\nwhole of their lives drifting about in the surface water. They occur\r\nin incredibly large numbers, and are the most abundant of all forms of\r\nmarine life. These copepoda form the main source of the food of pelagic\r\nfish, such as the herring, mackerel and sprat.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the edible molluscs, oyster, mussel, cockle, develop in\r\nthe warm surface water until they settle to the bottom and begin their\r\nadult life.\r\n\r\nThere are also many larval forms of marine worms and jellyfish, and\r\nmany kinds of microscopic, unicellular organisms, some of which are\r\nvegetable and others are clearly animal. The chief animal forms belong\r\neither to the Infusoria, the Foraminifera or the Radiolaria. The shells\r\nof the two latter forms accumulate at the bottom of the sea, producing\r\nthe deposits known as the Globigerina and Radiolarian oozes. In this\r\nway, chalk deposits were formed in primitive times.\r\n\r\nThe most important vegetable planktonic organisms are the Diatoms.\r\nTheir accumulated shells form important deep-sea deposits.\r\n\r\nThe numerous varieties of planktonic life can thus be divided into two\r\ngroups: those minute animal and vegetable organisms that pass the whole\r\nof their existence at the surface of the sea—the true constituents of\r\nplankton all the year round—and the eggs and larvae of many species\r\nof fish that are found among the plankton only at certain times of the\r\nyear—notably in spring and summer.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of organic food substances such as albumen, fat and\r\ncarbohydrate, that is contained in the plankton produced annually by\r\na given area of the sea, has been compared with the quantity of such\r\nsubstances produced by a similar area of land in crops such as pasture,\r\nhay, lupine and peas. In this way, it has been estimated that the\r\nproductivity of the sea is about 20 per cent less than that of average\r\nland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLANKTON: LARVAE\r\n\r\n1. Crab zoea; 2.

A Radiolarian.\r\n\r\nFIG. 6]\r\n\r\nUnlike that of the land, the productivity of the sea is greater in\r\ncolder latitudes than in the tropics. This somewhat unexpected fact is\r\nattributable to the action of denitrifying bacteria which, flourishing\r\nmore readily in warm, tropical waters, effectively reduce the amount\r\nof available nitrogen compounds in the water. In colder waters,\r\ndenitrifying bacteria are less active, and nitrates and nitrites are\r\navailable in larger quantities for the nourishment of the plankton.\r\n\r\nAll the great fisheries of the world are prosecuted in cold or\r\ntemperate seas; as examples of this we have the Banks of Newfoundland,\r\nthe cod fisheries of Norway, and the great trawling grounds of the\r\nNorth Sea and the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\nAll fish, during the larval stage of their development, feed first upon\r\nthe contents of the yolk sac which, when they are hatched, is attached\r\nto their ventral surface. When the yolk is absorbed, the larvae feed\r\nupon the microscopic plankton that abound in the water on every side.\r\nThe surface water, with its warm temperature, high plankton content\r\nand sunlight, forms an ideal nursery for the very young fish of all\r\nspecies. Demersal fish, as they complete the larval stage of their\r\ndevelopment and descend into deeper water, have to rely for their food\r\neither upon the various species of young shellfish and crustacea that\r\ndrop from the surface water as they develop, or hunt for their food\r\namongst the small fish, mollusca, crustacea, worms and seaweeds of the\r\nsea-bottom. Plaice feed chiefly upon cockles and other mollusca, which\r\nin their turn feed upon diatoms. The cod is almost omnivorous, greedily\r\ndevouring small fish, crustacea, worms or mollusca; its favourite food,\r\nhowever, is shrimps and prawns. These, in their turn, feed upon smaller\r\ninvertebrates, for example small jellyfish and larval molluscs, and\r\nthese upon microscopic plankton.\r\n\r\nPelagic fish, herrings and mackerel, feed almost entirely upon the\r\nlarger plankton, mainly copepoda (small, shrimp-like crustacea). These\r\nmay be present in the surface water in enormous quantities at certain\r\ntimes. In many cases, shoals of herring or mackerel probably follow\r\nspecial swarms of copepoda. Mackerel also feed upon young fish, hermit\r\ncrabs, and prawns.\r\n\r\nWith a few notable exceptions, the various species of demersal fish\r\nfeed upon smaller fish. Thus—\r\n\r\nThe hake, normally a deep-water fish, ventures inshore in pursuit of\r\nherrings, pilchards, mackerel.\r\n\r\nThe ling, turbot, brill, dog fish live entirely upon small fish. The\r\ndog fish swarms on certain fishing grounds and is often a serious pest\r\nto the drift-net fishermen, destroying their nets as well as the fish\r\nthat are attached to them.\r\n\r\nThe whiting, like the cod, feeds upon small fish, and upon crustacea\r\nand mollusca.\r\n\r\nThe food of the haddock consists of mollusca, crustacea and marine\r\nworms, etc.\r\n\r\nThe sole lives on small crustacea, for example shrimps, and marine\r\nworms.\r\n\r\nSkates and rays feed upon mollusca and crustacea.\r\n\r\nMost shellfish live in shallow water and feed upon the plankton.\r\n\r\nThe methods by which fish obtain their food differ greatly according\r\nto the species of the fish. Pelagic fish, e.g. herring and mackerel,\r\nsprat and pilchard, obtain their food almost automatically as they\r\nswim open-mouthed through the water in which it abounds. These direct\r\nplankton-feeders possess comb-like structures—the gill-rakers—attached\r\nbehind the gill openings, and as the food-bearing water streams through\r\nthe mouth and gill openings of the fish, these structures strain the\r\nfood from it. The fish licks the plankton from its gill-rakers with its\r\ntongue and swallows it.\r\n\r\nMany pelagic fish, e.g. carp, trout, salmon, look for their food while\r\nswimming through the well-lighted surface water.\r\n\r\nDemersal fish—flat fish, cod, haddock, etc.—seek their food by scent\r\nand touch. The cod possesses a barbel attached to its chin, by means of\r\nwhich it feels for its food.\r\n\r\nThe Angler or Devil fish is a curious creature, from three to four\r\nfeet long, and appearing to consist almost entirely of head. It has a\r\nlarge mouth, and teeth that are hinged so as to admit food, but prevent\r\nit from escaping. The devil fish has a long feeler on the top of its\r\nhead, terminating in a tassel which, moved by the water, attracts the\r\nattention of small fish and lures them to their fate. This tassel is\r\na sensory organ and, when it is touched by the small fish, the angler\r\nfish snaps upwards with unerring aim at a point immediately in advance\r\nof the tassel.\r\n\r\nThe dog fish seeks its food exclusively by scent. If its sense of smell\r\nbe destroyed, it ceases to feed spontaneously.\r\n\r\nThe sole also seeks its food by smell. It is quite unable to recognize\r\na worm by sight or touch, even when hung just above its head, but feels\r\naimlessly over the ground seeking it by smell.\r\n\r\n=Reproduction.= Fish are male and female and, with few exceptions,\r\nreproduce their kind by laying eggs. The number of eggs laid by an\r\nindividual female fish during a single spawning varies greatly,\r\naccording to the species. The average number of eggs spawned by a\r\nsingle female fish in the course of one season, is—\r\n\r\n  Ling                 18,500,000\r\n  Turbot                8,600,000\r\n  Cod                   4,500,000\r\n  Flounder              1,000,000\r\n  Sole                    570,000\r\n  Haddock                 450,000\r\n  Plaice                  300,000\r\n  Herring                  32,000\r\n  Shark   }       {A few—not more\r\n  Dog fish}       {than a dozen.\r\n  Skate   }\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7\r\n\r\nHERRING EGGS—×5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8\r\n\r\nPLANKTON CONTAINING FISH EGGS—×3\r\n\r\nThe large egg is that of a plaice: the smaller ones are cod and whiting.\r\n\r\nThe copepod is a calanus.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the cod, whiting, haddock, fluke, plaice, etc., are\r\nrelatively small, varying from 1/6 of an inch in the case of a halibut,\r\nto 1/25 of an inch in a flounder. The eggs are discharged into the\r\nwater by the female. This process takes place gradually, and generally\r\noccupies many weeks. A few of the eggs come to maturity at a time, and\r\nare extruded. They are fertilized in the water by the spermatazoa of\r\nthe male, which are discharged into the water at the same time as the\r\neggs. The fish, both male and female, are closely crowded together on\r\nthe spawning grounds, so that the fertilization of the eggs is fairly\r\ncomplete. With few exceptions, the eggs of most species are buoyant\r\nand float to the surface, where they drift in the warm surface water\r\nuntil, happily, they hatch. Unhappily, however, a very large proportion\r\nof them never reach maturity, for, either as eggs, embryos or larvae,\r\nor post larval young fishes, they soon fall a prey to marauding fish.\r\nIt is estimated that, of the thirty-two thousand eggs laid annually by\r\neach female herring, not more than two reach maturity.\r\n\r\nThe spawning grounds of the herring are not definitely known. Research\r\nis being carried out at present with a view to solving this question.\r\nHaddock are to be caught in various likely parts of the sea, marked\r\nwith the place of capture, and their interiors examined for herring\r\nspawn.\r\n\r\nCertain demersal fish, notably shark, dog fish and skate, deposit a\r\nfew large, demersal eggs—about a dozen in the year—in a carefully\r\nselected spot. The incubation period of these eggs is unusually long,\r\nbeing from six months to over a year, according to the species and the\r\ntemperature of the water.\r\n\r\nParental care is exhibited by very few fishes in this part of the\r\nworld, although many foreign fish build nests and care for their\r\nyoung, often carrying them in their mouths. Certain kinds of dog fish\r\nand angel fish keep their young inside their oviducts until they\r\nare completely formed. The only notable example of a fish common to\r\nBritish waters that exercises parental care is the stickleback. Spawn\r\nis deposited by a number of different females in a nest constructed\r\nof stones and weed, and is guarded by a male until all the eggs are\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the crustacea, for example the lobster, are found attached\r\nin large numbers to the swimmerets—feathery processes that are\r\nsituated underneath the tail. When in this condition, the lobster is\r\nknown as “berried,” and, if captured, should be returned to the sea.\r\nThe eggs are sticky and are laid while the lobster lies on her back,\r\nand so become attached to the hairs of these feathery processes.\r\nBerried crabs, prawns and shrimps may also be observed on the seashore\r\nin the spring and early summer.\r\n\r\nThe mollusca, e.g. mussels, periwinkles, oysters, deposit their eggs\r\nin the sea-water. The eggs float to the surface, hatch out, and drift\r\nabout with the other constituents of the plankton. The fully developed\r\nlarvae fall to the sea bottom and become attached to seaweed and stones.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation of fish eggs varies according to the species\r\nof fish, and for the same species is prolonged by a low temperature.\r\nPlaice eggs, fertilized in January, hatched in eighteen days; others,\r\nfertilized in April, were hatched in nine days.\r\n\r\nAll fish, on emerging from the egg, enter upon a larval stage in which\r\nthey resemble each other very closely (_see_ Fig. 1). (Thus, the larvae\r\nof plaice are quite symmetrical, like those of the cod or other round\r\nfish.) The newly hatched larvae drift helpless in the water for two or\r\nthree weeks, during which time they subsist upon the contents of the\r\nyolk sac, which they carry attached to their ventral surface. When this\r\nis exhausted, they feed upon the microscopic plankton which abound in\r\nthe surrounding water.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic forms of the different species of flat fish are\r\ngradually assumed by the young fish during the period of their larval\r\ndevelopment. The appearance of a newly-hatched young plaice exhibits\r\nlittle change during the first week or so, other than that due to\r\nthe gradual disappearance of the yolk sac. The young fish grows very\r\nslowly, and, twenty-one days after hatching, is only 3/8 of an inch\r\nin length. For thirty days the development of the young fish is\r\nentirely symmetrical. During the succeeding fifteen days, the shape\r\nand appearance of the fish become profoundly modified. The left eye\r\ngradually moves upwards and forwards, until it attains its final\r\nposition above and in front of the right eye. At the same time, the\r\nfish gradually acquires a new swimming position, finally swimming on\r\nwhat is really its left side. This left side becomes colourless. With\r\nthese changes in form and habit, there proceeds a transformation in the\r\ndiet of the fish. At twenty-one days it feeds upon the young stages of\r\nvarious crustacea. Gradually it acquires a taste for copepoda and the\r\nlarvae of mollusca and crustacea. After its metamorphosis is complete,\r\nit feeds upon various worms, small shrimps and small, bottom-living\r\ncrustacea. The adult plaice feeds upon mollusca of the cockle and\r\nmussel families.\r\n\r\n=The Migration of Fishes.= Fishes, like birds, migrate over great\r\ndistances at certain seasons of the year. In most cases, this migration\r\noccurs just before spawning, and is evidently connected directly with\r\nthe spawning instinct. True marine fishes, such as the herring,\r\nhaddock, plaice, cod, associate in vast numbers at spawning time,\r\nchoosing a locality in which the temperature and food supply will be\r\nfavourable to the development of the young larvae. Generally, the\r\nspawning ground is in deep water. The eggs are buoyant, and drift up to\r\nthe warm surface water and hatch out amongst the plankton. The herring\r\ndiffers from most other pelagic fish in laying its eggs in relatively\r\nshallow water, over a rocky bottom covered with seaweed. The eggs are\r\ndenser than sea-water and are covered with an adhesive substance, so\r\nthat they sink to the bottom and become attached to the stones and\r\nseaweed.\r\n\r\nIt is at the time of this annual migration to the spawning grounds that\r\nthe fish are most profitably caught, for not only are they gathered\r\ntogether in large numbers, but, just before spawning, the fat content\r\nand general condition of the fish, and therefore its food value, reach\r\na maximum. After spawning, the food value of the fish is at a minimum,\r\nand remains comparatively low until a few months before the next\r\nspawning.\r\n\r\nThe plaice migrates in the autumn from the feeding grounds in various\r\nparts of the North Sea to the spawning grounds near the Straits of\r\nDover. Spawning takes place between December and March. In the spring\r\nand summer it returns northwards to the feeding grounds in the centre\r\nof the North Sea.\r\n\r\nIn the Irish Sea, there are two distinct annual migrations of plaice.\r\nThe first occurs in summer (from June to September), the larger plaice\r\nmoving from the warmer, shallow water inshore to the deeper, cooler\r\nwaters offshore. In winter and spring, (from October to May), the\r\nmature plaice migrate from Morecambe and Liverpool bays to the spawning\r\nground in deep water to the North-East of Douglas (Isle of Man).\r\n\r\nIn winter, also (from November to January), a large number of plaice\r\ngather in Red Wharf Bay, off the north coast of Anglesey, probably\r\nbecause it is sheltered from the prevailing south-east winds. In\r\nFebruary they commence their spawning migration round the coast of\r\nAnglesey to Cardigan Bay.\r\n\r\nCertain species of fish, instead of migrating from one part of the sea\r\nto another, migrate from the sea to rivers (anadromous), or from rivers\r\nto the sea (katadromous).\r\n\r\nThus, in the spring or autumn, according to species, the anadromous\r\nsalmon and shad ascend rivers to spawn. The eggs are deposited on clean\r\ngravel in clean water, where they are likely to remain undisturbed. The\r\nsalmon does not feed when in the river, and after spawning, becomes\r\nvery thin and in poor condition.\r\n\r\nThe Alaskan salmon, from which the bulk of American canned salmon\r\ncomes, exists in five species. It has a similar spawning habit to the\r\nBritish salmon, except that the same species always tends to use the\r\nsame rivers. Once having spawned, the fish dies, so that the parents\r\nnever see their offspring. The young larvae hatch out in the fresh\r\nwater and make their way to the sea, where they pass the whole of their\r\nlives until they are mature, some years later, and then, in their turn,\r\nascend the rivers to spawn.\r\n\r\nEels are normally fresh-water fish. After living for six or seven\r\nyears in rivers and ponds and streams, they become mature and migrate\r\nto the sea to spawn. This spawning always takes place in deep water\r\n(over five hundred fathoms), the particular region chosen depending\r\nupon the species. Eels from the British Isles and North-West Europe\r\nspawn in deep Atlantic, some hundreds of miles west of Ireland. In\r\nthe autumn, the mature eels move down the rivers to the sea. When\r\napproaching maturity, the yellowish coat of the eel changes to silver.\r\nThese “silver” eels pass into the sea and are never seen again. It\r\nis probable that the eel only spawns once in its life and then dies.\r\nThe spawn floats to the surface and hatches out into curious little\r\ntransparent, leaf-shaped larvae. These larvae develop rapidly into\r\nelvers and commence the return journey to the shores and rivers. In the\r\nspring, the young eels ascend the rivers in enormous swarms. Many of\r\nthem leave the rivers and travel over damp ground and grass to isolated\r\npools and lakes. It is probable that the eels that are found in the\r\nThames travelled overland from the Severn.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic flounder migrates in winter from rivers and estuaries to\r\nthe open sea, and spawns in spring in deep water. It returns in the\r\nsummer when the spawning is over. By observing the movements of marked\r\nfish, it has been shown that the fish move at an average rate of from\r\nthree to four miles per day. During its seaward migration, the flounder\r\ntakes no food, but uses the material stored up in its tissues for the\r\ndevelopment of its reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these spawning migrations, there are migrations that are\r\nprompted by a search for food, or for warmer or colder water.\r\n\r\nIn northern and temperate seas, the surface water grows warmer with the\r\nspring. This warming influence spreads northwards from the equator,\r\nproducing what is known as the annual wave of sea temperature. A direct\r\nresult of the rise of temperature and the increased sunshine is a\r\nrapid increase in the amount and quality of the plankton. It is not\r\nsurprising, therefore, that fish migrate in the wake of this annual\r\nwave of sea temperature, attracted by the increased food supply, and\r\npossibly, also, by the warmer water.\r\n\r\nThe mackerel is a southern fish, and prefers the warm water of the\r\nMediterranean and West African coast. In spring, as the wave of rising\r\nsea temperature travels northwards, it migrates to the English Channel\r\nand the North Sea. This migration is often directly associated with the\r\npresence, in large quantities at that season, of a particular kind of\r\ncopepod in the surface water of the English Channel.\r\n\r\n=Phosphorescence.= Many marine creatures, ranging from deep-sea fish\r\nliving in the dark abysses of the ocean to various species of the\r\nminute plankton drifting in the surface water, possess phosphorescent\r\norgans, which emit light of low intensity similar to that of a\r\nglow-worm and firefly. In many cases the light appears to possess some\r\nimportant function, and highly specialized organs are developed. In\r\nsuch cases the light is only emitted in response to some stimulus—thus,\r\nthe phosphorescence of the surface water of the sea, when disturbed by\r\nthe blade of an oar, is due to the disturbance of myriads of minute\r\nplanktonic organisms, equipped with phosphorescent organs, either\r\nprotozoa or protophyta; many pelagic copepods are phosphorescent. In\r\nother cases, phosphorescence appears to be a more or less accidental\r\nby-product of some other process, and of little or no significance. The\r\nsubstance which produces the glow is contained in the slimy secretion\r\nproduced by the epidermal glands of the fish, and, as phosphorescence\r\ncan only occur in the presence of oxygen, it is evident that the light\r\nis produced by the slow oxidation of this substance. The colour of the\r\nlight emitted by marine organisms is generally blue or light green, but\r\nred and lilac also have been observed. The distribution and colour of\r\nthe light or lights produced by individual fish vary with the different\r\nspecies. In many cases it would appear that these points of light\r\nprovide the means by which fish recognize each other in the dark depths\r\nof the ocean. Some fishes possess highly developed phosphorescent\r\norgans known as photophores, consisting essentially of a group of\r\ngland cells that secrete the phosphorescent fluid. These organs are\r\ngenerally distributed in rows along the sides and ventral surface of\r\nthe fish. Some fishes possess more complex and highly developed organs\r\ncontaining, in addition to the gland cells, a system of blood vessels\r\nand nerves, a transparent, protecting membrane and reflector, an\r\niris-like diaphragm and a lens. These more complex organs are generally\r\nlarger and less numerous than the simpler ones. Possibly they are used\r\nto search for, or to attract, prey.\r\n\r\nThe phosphorescence of decaying fish and meat is due to the presence\r\non the fish or meat of certain bacteria of putrefaction, which are\r\nthemselves phosphorescent. When seen under the microscope, the\r\nindividual bacteria appear as shining points of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF FISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nFish may be captured with spear, trap, line or net. Which of these\r\nmethods is employed necessarily depends very much upon the size and\r\nhabits of the fish, and upon the skill and available equipment of the\r\nfishermen.\r\n\r\nSpears and traps were used in prehistoric times and survive to this day\r\nin various forms, e.g. harpoons, lobster pots, hedge baulks, fishing\r\nweirs and the various ingenious traps and entanglements that are used\r\nby primitive races in all parts of the world. The logical development\r\nof the spear and the trap into the line and the net was made possible\r\nby the invention of string.\r\n\r\nTo design and construct a trap, it is generally necessary to know\r\nsomething of the habits of the fish to be caught. Hedge-baulks and\r\nfishing weirs are fairly extensive enclosures made of brushwood,\r\nbasket work, stakes or stones, constructed on the foreshore in such a\r\nway that at high tide the sea carries the fish into the enclosure and\r\nleaves them there when it recedes. These fishing weirs are probably the\r\nprimitive origin of most forms of fishing nets.\r\n\r\nThe crab or lobster pot or creel is constructed of basket-work, in\r\nshape somewhat like a safety inkpot, so that the lobster or crab can\r\neasily enter it, but, once in, is unable to escape. Lobster pots,\r\nsuitably baited with fish and weighted, are distributed over the\r\nfishing ground—a rocky bottom full of crevices—from small, open boats,\r\nand are gathered the next day.\r\n\r\nFishing with hook and line is also a very ancient method. Before the\r\ndiscovery of metals, the hooks were made of bone. Some people—notably\r\nthe Chinese—frequently use unbaited hooks, and rely upon the jerk of\r\nthe hook at the right moment to secure the fish. Generally, however,\r\nthe hook is suitably baited, the method being used chiefly for fish\r\nthat seek their food by scent or sight, e.g. cod and shark. Line\r\nfishing for cod is still employed on a large scale off the North of\r\nScotland and the coast of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nIn lining, the fish are caught individually. A “line” may be as much\r\nas seven miles long. Short pieces of line from two to three feet long\r\nare attached to it at regular intervals. These lines are called the\r\n“snoods,” and carry the hooks. The line is usually shot at night, and\r\nfished in the morning. In most cases line fishing is rapidly being\r\nsuperseded by trawling.\r\n\r\nThe invention of netting marked a notable advance in the primitive\r\ndevelopment of the fishing industry. The net in all its various forms\r\nand applications is the characteristic and all-important implement of\r\nthe fishing industry. A net may be used either to surround a fish and\r\ndrag it out of the water, as in seining or trawling, or it may be used\r\nto enmesh the fish, as in drift netting. The rise and development of\r\nthe sea fishing industry has been due very largely to the gradually\r\nimproved efficiency of the net.\r\n\r\nNets were originally used on the shore. A long strip of netting was\r\nattached to upright stakes, to form an enclosure with an opening\r\ntowards the sea, constructed like a fishing weir in such a way that\r\nthe fish enter the enclosure at high tide and are unable to escape.\r\nSuch devices constructed on shore are known as “fixed engines”; they\r\ninclude stake nets, poke nets, stream nets and purse nets. The net may\r\nsimply form the wall of an enclosure (stake net). This enclosure may\r\nbe furnished with a pocket at one corner (poke net). It may consist\r\nessentially of one long, deep pocket kept open by rings or stakes at\r\nintervals (purse and hose nets). It may be simply a wall of netting\r\ninto which the fish thrust their heads; owing to their gill openings\r\nthey are unable to withdraw and so become entangled (stream net).\r\n\r\nThe first development of a movable net was the seine or drag net. The\r\nseine is a semi-circular drag net, which is shot in shallow water so\r\nas to enclose an area of water close to the shore. It is then hauled\r\nashore, and gathers up the fish that are in the enclosed area of water.\r\nSuch a net is limited to inshore use. Generally, a line is attached to\r\neach end of the net. The free end of one of these lines is made fast to\r\nthe shore by a stake, and the net is paid out from a small boat. When\r\nthe whole of the net has been paid out, the boat travels round until\r\nthe net forms a semi-circle of which the diameter is parallel to the\r\nshore; the net is then hauled in.\r\n\r\nThe seine net was used in ancient times by Phoenicians, Greeks, and\r\nother Mediterranean peoples. Various types of seines are in common use\r\nto-day. In Denmark a seine net is employed to catch eels and plaice.\r\nOn the Cornish coast pilchards are caught with a large seine up to\r\ntwo hundred fathoms long and eight fathoms deep. In the United States\r\na seine is used in water of any depth to catch mackerel. Rings are\r\nattached to the foot-rope of the net, and by passing a line through\r\nthese rings and drawing it tight, the net is transformed into a bowl of\r\nnetting. This is called the purse seine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9\r\n\r\nTRAWLING (_circa_ 1750)]\r\n\r\nThe seine was first improved by the addition of a pocket at its centre.\r\nThen the sides or wings were gradually lengthened, until finally it\r\ndeveloped into a deep, conical, bag-shaped net, furnished with long\r\narms or wings. This was dragged along the bottom, behind a boat in\r\nfull sail. The net was weighted and its mouth kept open by attaching\r\nits upper edge to a beam of wood (beam trawl). When the net was full\r\nof fish, it was run ashore. Ultimately, instead of drawing the net\r\nashore, the fishermen remained at sea and hauled the net on board with\r\na winch. In this way the seine net gradually developed into the trawl\r\nnet. The trawl net marked a big improvement, for it could be fished in\r\ndeeper water further from shore, and thus greatly increased the scope\r\nof fishing operations, and led to the rapid growth and improvement of\r\ndemersal fishing.\r\n\r\nTrawling is said to have been invented at the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury by the Brixham fishermen. The first trawlers were quite small\r\nvessels, and were followed towards the end of the eighteenth century by\r\nthe smack. The smack reached its maximum size and efficiency at about\r\nthe middle of the nineteenth century. Some of the smacks that are still\r\nfishing from Brixham—durable, seaworthy, and with beautiful lines—are\r\nprobably a hundred years old.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, there were a thousand first-class smacks in the North Sea,\r\nthree hundred in the English Channel, and over a hundred in the Irish\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nThe smacks were fitted with a tank in the well of the ship, in which\r\nthe fish were kept in sea-water and brought in alive. In Denmark\r\nto-day, plaice are brought ashore and sold alive.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent development of trawl fishing has been in the\r\nconstruction of larger nets, worked by more powerful trawling vessels\r\ndriven by steam.\r\n\r\nThe size of beam trawl that can be worked by a large sailing smack is\r\nlimited by the trawling power of the vessel, and also by the difficulty\r\nof constructing and handling very long beams. The maximum length of\r\nbeam in general use by sailing smacks is fifty feet. The length of\r\nthe net, from its mouth to the narrow of “cod” end, rarely exceeds\r\na hundred feet. To each end of the beam is attached a triangular\r\ntrawl-head of iron, which moves along the ground and serves to keep\r\nthe beam about three and a half feet above the ground. These trawl\r\ncrossheads are attached to the ship by bridles and warp.\r\n\r\nThe upper edge of the net is attached to the beam, the lower edge being\r\nattached to a stout rope—the foot-rope—the ends of which are made fast\r\nto the crossheads. This foot-rope, being considerably longer than the\r\nbeam, sweeps along the ground abaft of the beam, to form a deep curve\r\nknown as the “bosom” of the net. The result is that, when the foot-rope\r\ndisturbs the fish so that they leap to avoid it, the beam has passed on\r\noverhead and they leap into the net.\r\n\r\nPockets are formed in the sides of the net by lacing the top and bottom\r\ntogether for about two-thirds of the distance from the mouth of the\r\nnet towards the cod end. The mouth of a pocket is at the cod end of\r\nthe net, so that fish reaching the cod end and attempting to return to\r\nthe mouth of the net, generally enter the pockets. A flap of netting\r\nsuspended some distance inside the mouth of the net serves as a valve.\r\nIt is easily lifted by the incoming fish, but tends to prevent their\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nThe netting is of hemp, the mesh gradually increasing from one inch at\r\nthe cod end to about two inches near the mouth, and is preserved with\r\ntar.\r\n\r\nWhen fishing, the vessel moves ahead at a steady, slow rate of from two\r\nto three miles per hour, dragging the trawl behind it. Smacks always\r\ntrawl with the tide. If they trawl against the tide, the net is lifted\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nDuring fishing the cod end is closed by the cod line, but at the\r\nconclusion of the trawl the net is hoisted aboard, mouth upwards, and\r\nthe contents are discharged upon the deck by drawing the cod line.\r\n\r\nThe otter trawl that is used by modern steam trawlers is from seventy\r\nto one hundred and twenty feet wide across the mouth, according to the\r\ncharacter of the fishing, and a hundred and ten feet long from the\r\nmouth to the cod end. The otter trawl is shown in Fig. 17. It differs\r\nfrom the beam trawl in that its mouth is kept open, not by being\r\nattached to a beam, but by otter boards, which are attached one to\r\neach side of the mouth of the net. These are attached to the net and\r\nto the warps by which the net is towed in such a way that the pressure\r\nof the water upon them causes them to diverge, thus keeping the mouth\r\nof the net open. The size of a beam trawl is necessarily limited by\r\nthe length of beam obtainable. The size of the otter trawl, however,\r\nis obviously only limited by the power of the steam trawler. The otter\r\nboards measure 11 ft. by 4 ft. 6 ins., are shod with iron, and weigh\r\n15 cwts. each. The warps, as the ropes are called which attach the\r\notter boards to the ship, are from three hundred to a thousand fathoms\r\nlong—generally a little over three times as long as the depth of the\r\nwater in which the trawl is to be used. Each board is attached to the\r\nsteamer by a separate warp. The upper edge of the mouth of the net is\r\nattached to a strong rope, called the “head” rope. The lower edge of\r\nthe mouth of the net is also attached to a strong rope, called the\r\n“foot” rope. As in the beam trawl, the foot rope is considerably longer\r\nthan the head line, and forms a bosom. Traps and pockets also are\r\ninserted in the sides of the net. When trawling on rough ground, the\r\nfoot rope is furnished with large, heavy, wooden rollers, called the\r\n“bobbins.”\r\n\r\nTrawl fishing, until quite recently, was almost entirely confined to\r\ndemersal fish, such as cod, plaice, haddock and halibut. In recent\r\nyears, however, considerable quantities of herring have been caught by\r\ntrawlers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10\r\n\r\nDRIFTING (_circa_ 1750)]\r\n\r\n=Drifting.= The drift net is essentially a completely submerged,\r\nvertical curtain of netting, one end of which is attached to a boat\r\ncalled a drifter. The net extends in a straight line from the boat,\r\nand may be as much as three miles long. Unlike the trawl net, the\r\ndrift net generally catches one kind of fish only—either herring or\r\nmackerel—drift net fishing being carried on at a time when these fish\r\ncome together in shoals near the surface for the purpose of spawning.\r\nThe trawl obviously only captures fish living at the bottom. At the\r\nsame time, of course, it captures all the fish at the bottom, whether\r\nimmature, or useless star fish, etc. The drift net, on the other hand,\r\nis generally used for a particular kind of fish—herring, mackerel,\r\nsprat—and only catches fish above a certain size.\r\n\r\nA drifter may be as much as 90 ft. long, with 20 ft. beam and 10 ft.\r\ndraught. Its foremast is so constructed that it may be lowered when\r\nthe vessel is steaming against a head wind, or when it is fishing.\r\nThe ordinary sailing drifter is rapidly being superseded by the\r\nsteam drifter, partly because the greater power of the steam driven\r\nboat increases its capacity and scope, and, further, owing to the\r\ncentralization of the industry at a few big ports at certain times of\r\nthe year, these harbours are so crowded that it is almost impossible to\r\nhandle a sailing drifter in them. Many of the larger sailing drifters\r\nhave been equipped with petrol engines which largely discount this\r\ndisadvantage. A steam drifter can travel at from 11 to 12 knots, and\r\nboth steamers and sailers carry a fishing crew of seven men and a boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11\r\n\r\nA SINGLE-BOATER AT FOLKESTONE]\r\n\r\n=Inshore Fisheries.= The development of steam fishing—trawling and\r\ndrifting—has resulted in the re-grouping of the fishing industry into\r\ntwo well-marked divisions. Fisheries, whether trawling, drifting or\r\nlining, that are carried on in deep water far from shore in large\r\nsteamers, for the most part owned by limited liability companies, are\r\nknown as offshore fisheries. The fisheries of the seashore, carried\r\non by small, privately-owned, sailing smacks and cutters within\r\nterritorial waters, are distinguished by the term “inshore fisheries.”\r\nThe inshore fisheries are mainly for shellfish, crabs, lobsters,\r\nshrimps and immature deep sea fish such as plaice, soles, flounders,\r\ndabs, codling and sprats.\r\n\r\nShrimps and whiting are caught with trawl nets of 25 ft. beam or less,\r\nand of about 1/4 in. mesh. The net is generally drawn behind a small\r\ncutter, but frequently it is used in shallow water with a horse and\r\ncart. These nets are generally made of flax or cotton, and are either\r\ntanned or tarred, in order to preserve them.\r\n\r\nSmaller, fine-meshed, trawl nets are used for catching shrimps and also\r\nimmature plaice, soles and dabs. These shrimp nets are either attached\r\nto a long handle and pushed through the water in front of the fisherman\r\n(push nets), or drawn behind a small boat or a horse and cart (trawl\r\nnets).\r\n\r\nLarger fish are sometimes caught in shallow water by casting a net over\r\nthe fish so as to enclose it (cast nets). The fisherman of the Eastern\r\nMediterranean uses a cast net with conspicuous skill. The net is\r\nessentially a circular disc of netting, to the circumference of which\r\nsmall weights are attached at regular intervals. A cord is attached to\r\nthe centre of the net, and the fisherman, standing knee-deep in the\r\nwater, grasps the net by its centre, swinging it round his head, and\r\ncasts it so that as it approaches the water it opens out, and with a\r\nsoft splash sinks through the water until it lies outstretched over the\r\nfish. It is then drawn up by the string attached to its centre, and the\r\nweighted edges fall together enclosing the fish.\r\n\r\nFish are often caught on shores and in rivers by causing them to pass\r\nbetween converging walls of stakes or basket work, until they enter an\r\nenclosure, the floor of which is covered by a net. When the fish have\r\ngathered in the enclosure, the net is pulled up.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of inshore fishery is that for periwinkles, in which\r\nthey are simply picked off the rock. Mussels live on the sea bottom, on\r\nthe lower half of the foreshore. They generally attach themselves to a\r\nstone by a thread. They are usually collected at low tide by hand or,\r\nwhen submerged, are raked from the bottom. The rake is from 2 to 3 ft.\r\nwide, and is furnished with teeth 10 ins. long, the back of the rake\r\nbeing covered with netting. Sometimes the mussels are submerged even at\r\nlow water and then a short rake is used.\r\n\r\nCockles live about an inch or so below the surface of the sand, and\r\nmaintain a connection with the water above by means of small tunnels\r\nin the sand. They occur abundantly in many places between high and\r\nlow watermark. When the cockles are abundant they are raked out of\r\nthe sand, the rake being from 10 ins. to 1 ft. wide, with teeth 1 in.\r\nlong. The cockles are riddled, the small ones being rejected. When the\r\ncockles do not exist in such large numbers, they are obtained by means\r\nof a “jumbo.” This is essentially a block of wood, 3 or 4 ft. long, and\r\n1 ft. wide, furnished with two upright handles. The jumbo is rocked to\r\nand fro on the surface of the sand, with the result that the cockles\r\nare gradually worked up to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE HERRING FISHING INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nHerrings abound in the waters round the coast of Great Britain.\r\nOrdinarily they are widely scattered in deep water, but at certain\r\ntimes of the year they come together in shoals in the warmer water near\r\nthe surface for the purpose of spawning. It is at this time that they\r\nare of greatest value for food purposes and, being gathered together in\r\nshoals, are most economically caught.\r\n\r\nThe herring may spawn at any time of the year. In this respect it\r\ndiffers from all other British marine food fishes. Most British caught\r\nherrings spawn during September and Autumn. Very little spawning\r\ntakes place during late winter and spring, i.e. just after minimum\r\nsea temperature. Each local race (or species) appears to spawn at a\r\nconstant time of the year. The date of the annual spawning, and hence\r\nthe herring fishing season, varies from point to point round the coast.\r\nHerrings caught at different places show well-marked differences in\r\nappearance and quality, which are evidently due to differences in\r\nspecies and feeding ground. The food value of the herring will depend\r\nalso upon the time of the year at which spawning occurs. Thus, in the\r\nIrish Sea, there are two races of herrings—the Manx and the Welsh. The\r\nManx herring spawns in summer (September), and is rich in fat; the\r\nWelsh herring spawns in winter (November and December), and is poor\r\nin fat. Herrings are first caught off the West coast of Scotland in\r\nthe waters round the Hebrides. This fishing begins in the middle of\r\nMay, its chief centre being Stornoway. In early June herrings are\r\ncaught in the waters round the Orkneys and Shetlands, and then in\r\nsuccession off Wick, Fraserburgh and Peterhead, and the Northumberland\r\ncoast (Eyemouth, Berwick and Sea Houses). About the middle of July the\r\nherring fishery season begins at Blyth and Shields, and at Scarborough\r\nand Grimsby towards the end of July. At Yarmouth and Lowestoft it\r\nbegins early in October. The last herrings to be caught in British\r\nwaters are caught round Devon and Cornwall in December.\r\n\r\nOf the various kinds of herring obtained at different places, the\r\nlargest and finest fish are those caught in Downings Bay off the North\r\nof Ireland, Castle Bay off the Island of Barra in the South Hebrides,\r\nand off the Shetlands. Herrings differ very much in their suitability\r\nfor handling, keeping and curing. Most herrings have a small gut which\r\nis easily removed without seriously damaging the body of the fish.\r\nBlyth and Shields herrings, however, are very rich and fat, and have\r\na specially big, distended gut. Such herrings are difficult to clean\r\nbecause, when this large gut is removed, the belly of the fish is so\r\ntender that it is often broken. Herrings caught off these ports are fat\r\nand oily, so that many are landed in a broken condition. The Yarmouth\r\nherring is firm and hard, and is the best adapted for handling and\r\ncuring.\r\n\r\nUnlike that of the cod, the flesh of the herring is very rich in oil\r\nand fat. The body flesh of the herring consists essentially of two\r\nwell-developed layers of adipose tissue, alternating with two layers\r\nof muscular tissue. The fat in this adipose tissue is very liquid and\r\noily, and tends to make the fish tender. The actual amount of body fat\r\nvaries widely throughout the year. It gradually rises to a maximum\r\nbefore spawning takes place, and diminishes slightly before spawning\r\nand afterwards rapidly to a minimum. Thus, the fat content of Manx\r\nsummer herrings is about 2 per cent during the winter, and rises\r\nrapidly in June and July, until in August, just before spawning, it is\r\nover 30 per cent. The herring has a small liver which also contains\r\nsome oil.\r\n\r\nFishing is carried out with drifters. Practically all drifters to-day\r\nare steam-driven, although recently a number of motor-driven drifters\r\nhave come into use. Motor-driven drifters are mostly sailing boats\r\nconverted. Each drifter carries a crew of seven men, including the\r\nskipper and engineer. The boats are largely privately owned and the\r\ncrew work on a share basis. A number of boats are owned by companies.\r\n\r\nThe boats from the various fishing ports work round the coast,\r\nfollowing the fishing from port to port. At Yarmouth during the fishery\r\nseason there are about 1,200 drifters from nearly all the fishing ports\r\nround the coast. Stornoway, Wick, Fraserburgh, Peterhead, Aberdeen,\r\nBerwick, Whitby, and Yarmouth are all well represented.\r\n\r\nEach boat carries from 70 to 80 nets. The nets are approximately 1\r\nin. mesh. Each net is essentially a long rectangular curtain, hanging\r\nvertically in the water. Its upper edge, which is about 55 yds. long,\r\nis buoyed up by about 80 to 84 corks distributed equidistantly along\r\nit from end to end. The net is about 6 yds. wide. Each net hangs with\r\nits upper edge about 2 fathoms below the surface of the water, being\r\nattached at each corner to two pellets or bladders, resembling large\r\nfootballs, and serving as floats.\r\n\r\nFishing nets and sails are often coated with warm gelatine, and then\r\nimmersed in a strong solution of tannin. This renders the gelatine\r\ninsoluble and preserves the nets against the attacks of destructive\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12\r\n\r\nHERRING DRIFTER]\r\n\r\nWhen fishing, the boat takes up a position stern on to the tide. The\r\nnets are paid out over the bow and connected up in line, and carried\r\nby the tide till they form one long line, one end of which is attached\r\nto the drifter. The position of the nets is indicated by the line of\r\nbladder floats.\r\n\r\nThe fish swim against the nets, push their heads through, and then,\r\nowing to their gill openings, find that they cannot withdraw their\r\nheads, and in this way are caught in enormous numbers. Generally,\r\nfishing goes on all night, and in the morning the nets are hauled in,\r\nand, together with the attached fish, are thrown into the hold situated\r\namidships. The drifters then return with all possible speed to the\r\nfish wharf. While the boats are returning to port, the men draw the\r\nnets from the hold and shake them free from any entangled fish. When\r\nthe drifter reaches port, she moors alongside the fish wharf, bow on,\r\nand unloads her cargo of fish, using her derrick mast. The fish are\r\nunloaded in a round basket which is stamped by the Fishery Board’s\r\nofficer as holding a quarter of a “cran.” The word “cran” is derived\r\nfrom the “crown” branded by the Fishery Board’s officer on each of the\r\ntwo wooden shafts in the basket.\r\n\r\nThe cran is the measure which is universally used in the trade. At\r\nYarmouth and Lowestoft originally herrings were counted out and sold\r\nby the “last.” A cran averages from 900 to 1,000 herrings and weighs\r\napproximately 3 cwts. A “last” equals ten crans, and originally\r\nconsisted of 13,200 herrings, counted out. This method, of course, was\r\ntoo slow and has now been abandoned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13\r\n\r\nCURING YARD AT YARMOUTH]\r\n\r\nThe herrings, as they are removed from the ship, are put into special\r\nbaskets called “swills,” each swill holding half a cran. The swills\r\ncontaining the day’s catch are arranged in rows on the fish wharf,\r\nopposite each drifter. It is a great sight to see about four or five\r\nhundred drifters lying, bow on, alongside the fish wharf for about\r\n2-1/2 miles, all unloading fish as fast as they can.\r\n\r\nA good day’s catch would consist of about 90 crans. A good catch,\r\ntherefore, would average about 100,000 herrings, and would weigh about\r\n13 tons. Some boats come in with as many as 160 crans of fish, and\r\nthe total “cranage” for a day may exceed 30,000. The total catch for\r\nYarmouth on a good day would be about 30,000,000 herrings, weighing\r\nabout 4,000 tons.\r\n\r\nSometimes when the catch has been poor, the drifters remain out on the\r\nfishing grounds for another day, rather than come home with a small\r\ncatch. In this case, the two catches are kept separate, the first catch\r\nbeing called “overdays.” Overdays are worth about half the price of\r\nfresh fish and are, of course, less suitable for high grade curing.\r\n\r\nAfter it has been purchased by the curer, the fresh herring may develop\r\ninto a salted herring, a red herring, a bloater, or a kipper, depending\r\nupon the degree of salting and smoking to which it is subjected.\r\nHerrings are sometimes put into cold storage, to be withdrawn\r\nsubsequently as occasion demands, either to be salted or, more\r\nfrequently, to be consumed fresh. Cold storage affords a convenient\r\nmethod of preserving herrings when there is a glut, for at such times\r\nit is often impossible to deal with the herrings adequately in the\r\nordinary curing yards.\r\n\r\n=Salted Herrings.= The fresh herrings are delivered to the curer’s\r\nyards. Here, the fish are emptied into broad, shallow troughs, which\r\ngenerally run from end to end of the yard. The troughs are about 4\r\nft. wide, and are generally made of wood and arranged at a convenient\r\nworking height. Usually, the trough is situated just inside the\r\nboundary wall, and the fish are delivered into it through large\r\nopenings in the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14\r\n\r\nSCOTTISH FISHER GIRLS]\r\n\r\nThe fish are gutted and salted by Scottish girls—many of them from\r\nthe Hebrides—who come to Yarmouth and other places in the season for\r\nthis purpose. These girls are all brought up in Scottish villages, and\r\nare extraordinarily expert in all the operations connected with the\r\ncleaning and salting of the fish. They work in crews of three, and take\r\nvery good care that each member of the crew is a good worker, as they\r\nare paid according to the amount of work they do.\r\n\r\nEach girl receives 25s. a week as a kind of subsistence allowance, and\r\nis paid 1s. a barrel for the work she does.\r\n\r\nAs the fish are delivered into the gutting trough, they are liberally\r\nsprinkled with salt, thus enabling the women to grasp the fish easily,\r\nas otherwise the fish are too slippery for quick handling.\r\n\r\nThe women work standing in a row beside the trough. They pick up a\r\nfish, gut it by inserting a sharp knife just below and behind the\r\ngills, and with a quick, upward cut, bring away the gut. The guts drop\r\ninto small tubs placed in front of each worker, and are collected\r\nperiodically and sold to manufacturers of manure. Behind each woman\r\nare three shallow tubs or baskets, and after she has gutted a fish,\r\nshe throws it behind her into one of the three tubs, according to\r\nits quality and size. In this way, the two operations of gutting and\r\nselecting the fish are combined. As the tubs of gutted fish become\r\nfilled, they are taken away by other girls to the barrel packers, and\r\nare packed in separate barrels, according to quality or size. The\r\nbarrels are arranged in long rows, generally parallel to, and at some\r\ndistance behind, the gutting trough. A girl will pack about three\r\nbarrels in an hour.\r\n\r\nThe gutted fish are first of all emptied into large, shallow tubs\r\ncalled “rousing tubs,” placed just behind the row of barrels, and are\r\nagain sprinkled with salt.\r\n\r\nThe packer takes an armful of fish from the rousing tub and drops them\r\ninto the barrel. Each time the fish are taken from the rousing tub\r\nthe contents of the tub are well stirred up. The fish are then packed\r\nin the barrel in layers, bellies upward, and each layer is liberally\r\nsprinkled with salt. In this way each individual fish is first of\r\nall thickly coated with salt in the rousing tub, and adjacent layers\r\nof fish in the barrel are also separated by a layer of salt. In this\r\npacking process, it is important that the fishery salt used should be\r\ncoarse, reasonably hard, slow in dissolving and present in considerable\r\nexcess. It should be coarse enough to prevent the fish from touching\r\neach other, thus enabling the brine to penetrate to every part. It\r\nshould be hard enough to withstand the pressure of the fish in the\r\nbarrel. It should dissolve slowly, so that the salting process takes\r\nplace gradually, enough salt remaining undissolved throughout the\r\nprocess to keep the fish from touching. Altogether, about 1 cwt. of\r\nsalt is used for each barrel of herrings cured.\r\n\r\nThe barrel, when fully packed, is covered over and left for about\r\neight days. During this time, the salt extracts water from the fish\r\nand dissolves in it to form a saturated brine. The efficiency of this\r\nsalting process necessarily depends upon the salt being present in\r\nconsiderable excess, so that the brine formed is kept saturated, and\r\nconsequently continues to withdraw water from the fish.\r\n\r\nAt the end of eight days, the barrels are opened, an inch hole is\r\ndrilled in the side at the bilge, and the pickle allowed to run out.\r\nIt is found that, owing to the withdrawal of water from them, the\r\nherrings have shrunk considerably, and some more salted herrings are\r\nadded to the barrel, until it is full again. It is then fastened down\r\npermanently, turned over on its side and filled with brine pickle, and\r\ncorked up.\r\n\r\nThe brine pickle which is formed during the eight days is not allowed\r\nto run to waste, but is used for filling up the barrels after they have\r\nbeen repacked. This brine pickle contains amino bases, together with\r\nsmall quantities of coagulable proteids, and is of distinct nutritive\r\nvalue. The Poles and Russians, who are great consumers of these\r\nsalted herrings, actually use the pickle as a kind of sauce or gravy,\r\ndipping their bread in it. This, together with the general demand for\r\nsalted herrings in these two countries, may very largely be due to the\r\ncomparative scarcity and high price of salt there.\r\n\r\nA cran of herrings (about 1,000 fish, weighing approximately 3 cwts.)\r\nuses up 1 cwt. of salt and, when completely salted, just fills a\r\nbarrel. The curer estimates that 5 to 6 tons of salt will be sufficient\r\nfor 100 crans of herrings. Herrings salted in this proportion should\r\nbe exported and consumed before the warm weather comes, as they are\r\nliable to decay if the temperature rises above 70° F. The herrings\r\nthat were packed for the British Government (1920-1921) were salted\r\nmore heavily than usual (7 to 8 tons of salt per 100 crans), as, owing\r\nto the uncertain condition of the Russian and German markets, it was\r\nnecessary to keep some of the fish in stock for a considerable time.\r\nSuch a heavily-salted fish would be unpalatable to the home consumer.\r\n\r\nIn Yarmouth and Lowestoft, and also in Scotland, 100 crans of herrings\r\nshould fill, when cured, from 125 to 130 barrels.\r\n\r\nHerrings are sometimes salted at sea, 1 ton of salt being used to each\r\nlast (10 crans) of herrings. Such herrings are mostly used to make “red\r\nherrings.”\r\n\r\n=Red Herrings.= A considerable trade in red herrings is done with\r\nthe Mediterranean and the Levant. For this trade, the fish must\r\nbe thoroughly smoke-cured, otherwise they will not keep in the\r\ncomparatively warm climate. The fish are first of all dry-salted in\r\nconcrete tanks about 10 ft. square and 6 ft. deep, arranged under the\r\nfloor of the curing house. Fresh fish and salt are simply thrown in and\r\nmixed up, and left to develop their own pickle.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, 1 ton of salt is used to 10 crans of herrings, and\r\neach tank will hold from 20 to 30 crans of the fish. The fish should\r\nbe left in these salting tanks for five days at least; sometimes, of\r\ncourse, they are left for months, according to the trade, in which case\r\nthe tanks practically serve as storage tanks for the salted fish. The\r\nfish are removed from the tank as required, washed, and put on “speets”\r\nand smoked. A “speet” is a wooden rod about 3 ft. 6 ins. long and\r\npointed at one end. The fish are threaded on the speet through the gill\r\nopenings and mouth, each speet holding from 20 to 30 fish. The speets\r\nare then stacked horizontally on racks in the smoke house “loves”\r\n(lofts), about 6 ins. apart and about 12 ins. above each other, until\r\nthe smoke house is filled from the roof to within a few feet of the\r\nfloor. When the smoke-house is filled, fires are lighted on the floor.\r\nGenerally, the fuel used is oak turnings, shavings, and sawdust. This\r\nmaterial burns quickly, and gives a very resinous smoke which not only\r\ndries the fish, but also permeates it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe rate of curing and the character of the finished product depend\r\nupon the temperature of the smoke, and the proportion of antiseptic\r\nresinous materials in it. When the oak or other suitable hard wood fuel\r\nis in the form of turnings or dust it burns quickly, and thus produces\r\na fairly hot smoke, containing antiseptic substances—for example,\r\nguaiacol and creosol. Such a smoke will cure the fish quickly.\r\n\r\nIf oak billets or logs are used they burn comparatively slowly. The\r\nsmoke, therefore, is not so hot and, since slow combustion in this case\r\nprobably means more complete combustion, the proportion of resinous\r\nconstituents in the smoke is liable to be considerably diminished. When\r\noak billets are used, therefore, curing takes place much more slowly.\r\n\r\nThe temperature in the smoke house will also depend very much upon the\r\nprevailing weather temperature outside. In cold weather it is difficult\r\nto keep the temperature up sufficiently. The curing takes longer, and\r\nresults in a hard cured product. In very warm weather, on the other\r\nhand, it is difficult to keep the temperature down, and a “fired” fish\r\nis sometimes produced, i.e. one which is half-cooked and soft. Such a\r\nfish is clearly unsuitable for packing for export.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the temperature of the smoke should be such that\r\nthe curing takes about 10 days.\r\n\r\nAfter smoking, the fish are taken off the speets and selected according\r\nto quality. Those which are large and perfect fetch a better price, and\r\ncommand an entirely different market from those which are damaged or\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nDuring the smoking of red herrings, the fires are lit each night, and\r\nsimply allowed to burn themselves out.\r\n\r\n=Bloaters.= There are two kinds of bloaters: those intended for the\r\nhome trade and those intended for the Mediterranean trade. For the home\r\ntrade the herring is lightly salted by immersing it in brine for two\r\nhours or less. It is then dried in the smoke-house for one night, using\r\nbillets. Unlike “reds” or kippers, it is not cured by the smoke, but\r\nsimply dried. The bloaters for the Mediterranean trade are salted in\r\nconcrete tanks in exactly the same way as red herrings, but, instead of\r\nbeing smoke-_cured_ for 10 days or so, they are simply smoke-_dried_\r\nfor two days.\r\n\r\n=Kippers.= Kippering is the only process in the herring industry in\r\nwhich the fish are split before curing. Fresh herrings (sometimes\r\nover-day herrings) are bought early in the morning from the drifters\r\nand taken to the curing yard. They are split down the back, close to\r\nthe backbone, and gutted and thrown into large, open baskets. The\r\nbasket and its contents (about 50 herrings) are then plunged into a\r\ntank of running water, and violently agitated to wash blood and slime\r\nfrom the fish. The fish are then thrown into brine in large tanks about\r\n6 ft. by 5 ft. by 4 ft., until the tank is full. Salt is then sprinkled\r\non the surface, and the fish are left from half to one hour, according\r\nto their size.\r\n\r\nThey are then hung on kipper speets. A kipper speet differs from a\r\nbloater speet. It is a square bar of wood about 3-1/2 ft. long, and of\r\n1 in. square cross-section. It is supported horizontally. The split\r\nherrings are opened out and impaled upon hooks at intervals along\r\neach side of the speet. Each speet in this way will carry about eight\r\nor nine herrings a side. The speets are then stacked on racks in the\r\n“loves” of the smoke-house, are smoked over-night, using fires of oak\r\nturnings and sawdust, and are packed the next morning in boxes.\r\n\r\nThe herring is probably the most abundant food fish known. During the\r\nautumn herring fishery of 1920, over 1,000,000 crans of herrings were\r\nlanded at Yarmouth and Lowestoft. If we assume that one cran measure\r\ncontains 1,000 herrings, we see that over 1,000,000,000 herrings were\r\ncaught in less than 4 months, and this probably represents only a\r\nsmall fraction of the number present on the fishing grounds. In 1913,\r\n11,762,748 cwts. of herrings, of value £4,412,838, were landed in Great\r\nBritain. In the same year, the exports of herrings from the British\r\nIsles were as follows—\r\n\r\n  Fresh herrings    1,464,296 cwts. worth  £1,212,493\r\n  Cured herrings    8,797,106  „      „     5,333,113\r\n                   ----------              ----------\r\n        Total      10,261,402  „      „    £6,545,606\r\n                   ==========              ==========\r\n\r\nThe quantity of herrings caught by other European countries is as\r\nfollows--\r\n\r\n                                cwts.           £\r\n\r\n  France (1911)               7,846,503      529,739\r\n  Germany (1913) Fresh          148,354       75,738\r\n     „      „    Salted       1,030,039      563,033\r\n  Holland (1911)              1,685,751      919,973\r\n  Norway (1912)               4,404,400      580,570\r\n  Denmark (1912)                845,295      140,051\r\n  Sweden (1912)                 861,420      205,555\r\n  Belgium (1911)                 13,000        5,000\r\n                             ----------    ---------\r\n                             16,834,762    3,019,659\r\n                             ==========    =========\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE NEWFOUNDLAND COD FISHERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cod is widely distributed in the northern and temperate seas of\r\nEurope and America. It lives close to the bottom, in from 25 to 50\r\nfathoms of water, and feeds upon fish, small crustacea, worms and\r\nmollusca. The cod spawns in the Spring. Of the 4,000,000 or so eggs\r\nthat are spawned by a single female cod, comparatively few are hatched,\r\nand fewer still reach maturity. The young are about 1 in. long by the\r\nbeginning of the summer, and become fit for the market at the end of\r\nthe second year. Usually, the fish are mature at the end of the third\r\nyear, and then measure about 3 ft. in length, and weigh from 12 to 20\r\nlbs. They are in the finest condition in October, November and December.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its great value as a food fish, the cod, like the\r\nsturgeon, yields isinglass (a pure fish gelatine) from its swimming\r\nbladder, and oil from its liver. Cod-liver oil is largely used as a\r\nremedy for scrofulous complaints—probably owing to its content of\r\nvitamins. It is also used effectively in cases of pulmonary consumption.\r\n\r\nCod is fished along the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, and on\r\nthe Banks. The Banks stretch for about 300 miles in a south-east\r\ndirection from the coast of Newfoundland towards the middle of the\r\nNorth Atlantic. They are swept by the cold Labrador current. A branch\r\nof the Gulf Stream passes over the southern portion of the Banks. These\r\ncurrents bring enormous quantities of plankton and small fish, which\r\nprovide excellent food for the many varieties of fish and small,\r\ninvertebrate, marine animals that inhabit the Banks. These, in their\r\nturn, provide abundant food for the cod.\r\n\r\nThe cod, together with other demersal fish, including haddock, hake\r\nand pollack, is caught with baited hooks and lines. This fishery has\r\ncontinued with unbroken prosperity for nearly four centuries. In\r\naddition to the Newfoundland boats, a large number of American boats\r\nset out for the Banks from Gloucester (Mass.). Most of the boats are\r\nsailing boats of about 35 tons capacity, and of sturdy construction.\r\nEach boat carries eight dories—small row-boats about 15 ft.\r\nlong—amidships. The crew consists of a captain and cook, and sixteen\r\nmen—two for each dory.\r\n\r\nThe “Banks” stretch for about 300 miles, by 200 miles wide, in a\r\nsouth-easterly direction, towards the centre of the North Atlantic. The\r\ndepths in which the fishing is carried on range from 20 to 120 fathoms\r\noff the coast of Newfoundland, from 15 to 90 fathoms on the Banks, and\r\nfrom 100 to 135 fathoms at the edge of the Banks. The vessel starts\r\nout for the fishing grounds with about 400 hogsheads of salt, and from\r\n15,000 to 25,000 lbs. of bait. The bait is generally frozen squid\r\nand herring. Capelan is also used as bait, but has to be obtained at\r\nMiquelon, the last port of call before putting out to the Banks. The\r\nbait must be well iced, as the cod will not bite well if the bait be\r\ntainted.\r\n\r\nDuring the second trip, squid is used as bait and is caught on the\r\nfishing grounds.\r\n\r\nAs the boat approaches the fishing grounds, the dories are made ready.\r\nEach dory carries four tubs of baited lines. A tub contains nine\r\nlines, each 50 fathoms long. When fishing, these lines are all strung\r\ntogether, so that each dory will run a string 1,800 fathoms long—about\r\ntwo miles. Each line carries about 90 hooks—that is, 3,200 hooks to\r\neach dory. A vessel with eight dories will thus set about 16 miles of\r\nline, carrying about 25,000 hooks. The hooks are attached to the lines\r\nby means of shorter lines called “gangings”—in Scotland they are known\r\nas “snoods”—about 2 ft. long. The complete line, as set by a dory, is\r\ncalled a “trawl.”\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the fishing grounds, soundings are made to determine the\r\ndepth and character of the bottom. The best fishing is obtained over a\r\ngravel bottom. The trawls are then set while the vessel is in motion (a\r\nflying set), and if the fish are found to be abundant the vessel drops\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nThe flying set is carried out as follows: The dories are towed astern\r\nand, when the right spot has been selected, are dropped at regular\r\nintervals until all are away. Each dory as it is dropped rows off at\r\nright angles to the course of the vessel, and in the same general\r\ndirection, throwing out its trawl as it proceeds until it is all set.\r\nThe vessel then returns diagonally across the fishing grounds to the\r\nstarting point, picking up the dories as their trawls are set. After\r\na time, the dories are dropped again in the same order as before, and\r\nthe men haul up the trawls and take the fish off. Each dory is then\r\npicked up in succession together with her catch. If this flying set is\r\nsuccessful, and other conditions are favourable, the vessel drops her\r\nanchor and fishing proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the trawls are set depends upon the tide. They are\r\nalways set as far as possible with the tide. Thus, the dories on the\r\nside of the vessel against which the tide is flowing row out against\r\nthe tide, until they are about a trawl-length from the ship. They then\r\nset the end of the trawl at the point, and work towards the vessel.\r\nOn the other side of the vessel the trawl is set from the vessel with\r\nthe tide towards the dory. Each end of the trawl is attached to an\r\nanchor by a line 1 fathom in length, and to a buoy by a line 25 fathoms\r\nlonger than the depth of the water at that point. Thus, the trawl is\r\nsituated just above the ground. The trawls are set once a day and drawn\r\nthree hours afterwards, or set in the afternoon and drawn the following\r\nmorning. The shorter the time between setting and drawing, the better\r\nthe condition of the fish. In hauling the trawl, one man stands in the\r\nbow of the boat and hauls in the trawl, detaching the fish, the other\r\nman receiving the trawl and coiling it. A dory carries on an average\r\n1,000 lbs. of fish, and may sometimes make two or three trips before\r\nthe line is cleared.\r\n\r\nThe fish are “gaffed” from the dories to the fishing vessel and are\r\nkept on deck, packed between division boards to prevent sliding or\r\nturning of the fish by the movements of the vessel.\r\n\r\nWhen the fish are all aboard, they are split and cleaned and salted\r\ndown. The crew is divided into splitting gangs, each consisting of\r\nthree men—the throater, the gutter, and the splitter. The throater\r\ngrasps the fish by the head with the left hand, and, holding it with\r\nits back on the edge of a tub, cuts its throat just behind the gills,\r\nand makes a slit down the belly. The head is then broken off by\r\ndownward pressure against the edge of the tub, and the fish is passed\r\non to the gutter. He opens the belly with his left hand, removes the\r\nliver for oil, and tears out the viscera. The fish then goes to the\r\nsplitter, who completes the ventral splitting of the fish and removes\r\nthe backbone.\r\n\r\nAfter being well washed, care being taken to remove all blood, the fish\r\nare passed down a canvas chute into the hold, where they are carefully\r\nsalted and piled in “kenches.” The fish are laid on their backs\r\nalternately nape and tail, salt being liberally sprinkled between the\r\nadjacent layers. Nearly 1-1/2 bushels of salt are used per 100 lbs. of\r\nfish. The pickle formed by the salt and the juices of the fish drains\r\naway to the bottom of the hold, from which it is pumped overboard.\r\nAs the kench or pile settles, more fish are added, so as to keep the\r\ncompartment full. Kenching begins in the forward compartment of the\r\nhold, and is carried on from side to side of the vessel. Each kench is\r\nabout 4 ft. by 7 ft., and the full height of the hold. The refuse is\r\nthrown overboard.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the “trawl” fishing, many boats use hand-lines. For this\r\npurpose, the lines are somewhat smaller, and only 13 ft. long. About\r\n100 barrels of bait are taken (slack-salted clams obtained on the coast\r\nof Maine), any additional bait that may be required being caught on the\r\nfishing grounds—squids, hagdens, and clams taken from the stomachs of\r\nfish.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel reaches the fishing grounds, the dories row away in\r\nall directions, each man for himself. The dory is anchored in water\r\nfrom 18 to 40 fathoms deep. Each fisherman uses two lines carrying two\r\nhooks a piece. The boats generally go out at sunrise and return to the\r\nfishing boat about six hours later. Two boatloads—that is, 2,000 lbs.\r\nof fish—make a good day’s work.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the vessel the fish are pitched on deck and counted,\r\nonly cod of over 22 ins. length being considered. Smaller fish, and the\r\n“shack”—pollack, haddock, cusk and hake—being counted separately. The\r\nfish are then dressed and salted, as already described.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, hand-line fishing is carried on from the deck of the\r\nfishing boat itself, while the boat drifts. Each man uses one line\r\ncarrying two hooks. The bait consists of iced cockles, broken with a\r\nhammer. The positions on the deck are followed by the crew in rotation,\r\nto give all an equal chance. As the fish are “landed” they are thrown\r\non to the deck, each man keeping his count by cutting out the tongues\r\nand keeping them in a separate bucket.\r\n\r\nOn the Georges Bank, south-east of Gloucester, which is one of the\r\nfavourite fishing grounds, the fish are caught by hand-line from the\r\ndeck of the ship while at anchor. Frozen herring are used as bait, when\r\npossible. All the fish caught on the Georges Bank are salted, except\r\nthe halibut, which is iced. Some idea of the value of these grounds is\r\ngained from the fact that a single fisherman may take 500 fish in a\r\nday. The Georges Bank area yields about 70 per cent of the total catch,\r\nthe Grand and Western Banks accounting for the remaining 30 per cent.\r\nApproximately 60 per cent of the fish are brought in iced, and 40 per\r\ncent salted.\r\n\r\nOn returning to port the fish are pitchforked on to the wharf, and\r\nsorted into snappers (less than 16 ins. from nape to tail), medium,\r\nand large (over 22 ins.) Generally, they are divided as follows: 4 per\r\ncent snappers, 41 per cent medium, and 55 per cent large. Each class\r\nis weighed separately and carefully examined for any indication of\r\nspoilage. Any suspected fish are thrown out. The fish are then washed\r\nand put with salt into butts in the store. Fish that are brought in\r\niced whole are sorted and weighed, and then beheaded, gutted, and split\r\nand salted. About eight bushels of salt are used to each hogshead of\r\nfish. The fish are kept, salted down in hogsheads until required, care\r\nbeing taken that the fish are kept covered with strong brine.\r\n\r\nAfter salting, the fish are dried. The salting process effects partial\r\ndrying by extracting a large proportion of the flesh fluids of the\r\nfish. The extraction of water by the salt is assisted by kenching, the\r\nfish at the bottom of the kench being pressed down by the weight of\r\nthose above.\r\n\r\nThe fish are taken from the butts as required, and are piled in a kench\r\nabout 4 ft. high, to express and drain off the pickle. At the end of\r\ntwo days the fish are re-piled, the top fish becoming the bottom, and\r\nso subjected to full pressure. If the weather is unfavourable for\r\ndrying, they are re-kenched every two or three days.\r\n\r\nThe fish are then dried by exposing them to wind and sun on a bed of\r\nlatticework about 8 ft. wide and 30 ins. above the ground, and as long\r\nas necessary, called a “flake.” The drying yard is known as the flake\r\nyard. The latticework is constructed of triangular-section, wooden\r\nlaths, placed about 3 ins. apart, the fish resting on the upper edges\r\nof the laths.\r\n\r\nIn the hot weather, the fish are protected from sunburn by canvas\r\nawnings, and from rain at night by coops.\r\n\r\nWith a warm sun and a good breeze, drying will be complete in about 10\r\nhours. Thorough drying throughout the body of the fish is accomplished\r\nby drying on the flakes until the surface is dry and crystallized. The\r\nfish is then kenched, and the dry surface salt extracts more moisture\r\nfrom the interior. The fish is then dried again, thus ensuring a much\r\nmore complete result.\r\n\r\nFish are also dried in some factories in large, steam-heated shelf\r\ndriers. This method is inclined to be too rapid, with the result that\r\nthe fish are only surface dried instead of being uniformly dried right\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAfter drying, the fish are kenched in the store until required. They\r\nare then skinned, the bones are removed, and they are moulded into\r\nblocks which are cut up into cakes for packing and export.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the loss in weight during the different operations\r\nis as follows—\r\n\r\n  Dressing                         40 per cent\r\n  Salting (full pickle)            17    „\r\n  Drying                            4    „\r\n  Skinning and boning              13    „\r\n                                   -----------\r\n              Total loss           74    „\r\n                                   ===========\r\n\r\nThe fresh waste, skins, bones, etc., of the fish are worked up for\r\nglue, the residue being manufactured into fertilizer. The best glue is\r\nobtained from the skins. The cod and cusk skins are superior in this to\r\nthe skins of hake and haddock.\r\n\r\nThe oil is extracted from the livers. That from fresh livers is refined\r\nand used for medicinal purposes, while that from old livers is used for\r\ntanning chamois leather. The value of this oil is considerable, as much\r\nas £150 being received by a boat in one trip for the oil alone.\r\n\r\nIn 1914, Newfoundland exported 60,000 tons of cod meat, worth\r\n£1,600,000. The chief market is the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTRAWL FISHERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the drift net, which only catches fish of one species and of\r\nfairly uniform size when they are swimming near the surface, the trawl\r\nnet scoops up practically all the inhabitants of the sea bottom,\r\nincluding round fish, e.g. cod and haddock; flat fish, e.g. sole and\r\nplaice, as well as various invertebrates (jelly fish), and marine\r\nplants and stones. The trawl is essentially a flattened, conical net\r\nthat is dragged open-mouthed along the sea bottom. The two kinds of\r\ntrawl in common use—the beam trawl and the otter trawl—differ in the\r\nmethod that is adopted for keeping open the mouth of the net. The beam\r\ntrawl is used by sailing vessels, the otter trawl by steamers.\r\n\r\nSailing trawlers are divided into two classes: first class smacks\r\nand second class cutters. The smack is a two masted vessel with fore\r\nand aft rig, generally making a five or six day voyage, and trawling\r\nin depths of up to 40 fathoms. The cutter makes shorter voyages—20\r\nhours—and generally keeps within territorial waters.\r\n\r\nTo work a beam trawl successfully, it is necessary to know the\r\ncharacter of the sea bottom, whether rough or smooth, and also the time\r\nand direction of the tide. The net is trawled with the tide a little\r\nfaster than it is running, so that sufficient resistance is encountered\r\nto keep the net extended. In shooting the trawl, great care must be\r\ntaken to make it alight on its runners in the correct position for\r\ntrawling. If the net be twisted, or if it alight upside down, it has\r\nbeen shot “foul,” and has to be hauled up and shot again. In preparing\r\nfor a shot the net is lowered over the side by adjusting the bridle\r\nropes, and the beam is coaxed into its proper position while the net\r\nis still near the surface. The net is then gradually lowered, the boat\r\nmoving slowly forward. The trawl is generally hauled for the duration\r\nof a tide—that is, six hours—during which time it will travel about\r\n15 miles. The net is generally hauled in by a steam capstan, driven\r\nby a small donkey engine. When the trawl comes alongside, the beam is\r\nsecured and the net is gradually hauled over the side by hand until\r\nthe cod end appears; this is then made fast to a rope and tackle,\r\nand hauled above the deck. The cod line is untied and the fish are\r\ndischarged upon the deck.\r\n\r\nSince trawling is generally carried out on smooth ground, the greater\r\nproportion of the catch consists of certain kinds of demersal fishes\r\nthat frequent sand and gravel. Of these, the most important are cod,\r\nhaddock, whiting, ling, hake, catfish, sole, plaice, turbot, and brill.\r\nCertain of these species also frequent rocky ground, and are taken in\r\nsuch areas by the line fishermen.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, line fishermen work in deeper water than trawlers\r\nand capture larger fish, though of fewer species, e.g. cod, halibut,\r\nling, skates and rays.\r\n\r\nThe original sailing trawlers are rapidly being superseded by steam\r\ntrawlers. The first steam trawling company was formed in 1882. It\r\nhad a capital of £20,000 and a fleet of four vessels. It trawled on\r\nthe Dogger Bank for three years with marked success. After this the\r\nfuture of steam trawling was assured. The steam trawler is many times\r\nmore efficient than a smack, for it can fish in nearly all weathers,\r\nincluding calm, and it can trawl over rough bottoms, owing to its\r\ngreater power, and can go much further afield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15\r\n\r\nMODERN STEAM TRAWLER (SECTION)\r\n\r\n  Total length, 160 ft.\r\n  Length between perpendiculars, 148·5 ft.\r\n  Greatest breadth (frame), 23 ft.\r\n  Draught, 13-3/4 ft.\r\n\r\n  _Explanation of Section._—1.

Storeroom.]\r\n\r\nModern British steam trawlers travel as far afield as Iceland,\r\nNewfoundland and Morocco.\r\n\r\nSteam trawling developed rapidly, and resulted in a correspondingly\r\nrapid decrease in the number of sailing trawlers. Between 1893 and\r\n1903, the number of first class smacks in Great Britain decreased from\r\nover 2,000 with an average tonnage (net) of 57·4 to less than 900 with\r\nan average tonnage (net) of 40. From 1903 until the present day, the\r\nnumber had remained between 900 and 800; it would seem, therefore,\r\nthat the relative numbers and importance of smacks and steam trawlers\r\ngradually attained to a condition of equilibrium. Between 1900 and 1906\r\nthe increasing importance of steam trawling received a temporary check.\r\nA steam trawler in those days would cost about £10,000 to construct and\r\nabout £5,000 a year to operate; their commercial success, therefore,\r\ndepended upon correspondingly large and valuable catches of fish being\r\nobtained. When first introduced on the fishing grounds round the coast\r\ntheir superior efficiency and speed amply compensated for their high\r\ncost. About 1900, however, the catch obtained by these vessels on\r\nthe home fishing grounds began to diminish, and the fishermen became\r\nalarmed lest the greatly increased efficiency of steam trawling should\r\nprove to be its own undoing, and result in the depopulation of the\r\nfishing grounds by over-fishing. Between 1900 and 1906, the number\r\nof steam trawlers fishing from British ports only increased by 200,\r\nwhereas, during the preceding 10 years, the numbers had increased from\r\na few hundred to over 2,000.\r\n\r\nThe anticipated exhaustion of the home grounds led to the steam trawler\r\nprospecting further afield. These longer voyages, as far as Iceland and\r\nthe White Sea and Morocco, were very successful. The result of this\r\nwas that larger steam trawlers were built, capable of undertaking\r\nlong voyages of many weeks’ duration. Between 1900 and 1906 the\r\naverage net tonnage of the steam trawlers increased from 54 to 62. The\r\nsteam trawlers, in opening up new and more distant fishing grounds,\r\nleft the home grounds to the smacks. Consequently we find that the\r\nsmacks confined their operation to the smooth ground in home waters,\r\nleaving the rough and more distant grounds to the steam trawlers. A\r\ndirect result of this gradual redistribution of the fisheries between\r\nsailing smacks and steamers was the development of specialized fishing\r\nports. Such ports as Lowestoft, Brixham and Ramsgate, off which good\r\nfish are obtainable and which are within easy access of good markets,\r\nhave retained their importance as smack ports; on the other hand, the\r\ndevelopment of steam trawling has led to the rapid growth of deep\r\nwater ports, such as Fleetwood, Grimsby, Hull, Aberdeen, and Milford\r\nHaven. In Grimsby, originally one of the greatest strongholds of\r\nsmack fishing, smacks have been entirely displaced by steam trawlers,\r\nowing to the special facilities which the port offers in being near\r\ncheap coal, in possessing deep water, and in being in direct rail\r\ncommunication with large markets for trawl fish.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the rapid development of steam trawling was\r\naccelerated by the invention of the otter trawl. This is not only a\r\nlarger net than the beam trawl, but is for all but small, flat fish,\r\na much more efficient instrument. From the study of market statistics\r\nbetween the years 1889 and 1898 Garstang has calculated that a steamer\r\ncaught on the average between four and seven times as much fish in the\r\nyear as a sailing smack.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16\r\n\r\n  I.—PLAN ON DECK.\r\n  II.—PLAN BELOW DECK.\r\n\r\n  _Plan of Arrangements on and below Deck._—(I) On deck: 1.

Her\r\nnet tonnage is from 60 to 200, her bunker capacity 250 tons, with\r\nstorage room for up to 120 tons of fish. She is fitted with triple\r\nexpansion engines of from 40 to 85 horse power. The forward part of\r\nthe ship is occupied by the living quarters of the crew, rope and\r\nnet store, iceroom, and fish-hold. Larger vessels, making trips to\r\ndistant grounds, will take as much as 30 tons of broken ice; this ice\r\nis distributed over the fish in layers, after they have been cleaned\r\nand gutted. In practically all modern fishing ports there is a special\r\nice factory situated near the quay, and ice is manufactured by the\r\nammonia process, crushed, and delivered to the ships through zinc-lined\r\nchutes. The fish-hold in the forward part of the ship extends right\r\nacross the ship and is from 9 to 10 ft. high, divided by a partition\r\ninto two compartments, each compartment fitted with two shelves 5 ft.\r\nlong, on which the fish are piled. These shelves reduce compression and\r\nfacilitate the storage of the fish, the front of each compartment being\r\nclosed with boards as it becomes full. She generally carries three or\r\nfour trawl nets, one on her starboard and the other on her port, one or\r\ntwo being down below in reserve. The boat is fitted with four gallows,\r\ntwo forward and two aft, one on each side of the boat. These gallows\r\nare used for lifting the otter boards out of the water when the trawl\r\nis hauled in.\r\n\r\nThe ship carries nine hands, consisting of skipper, mate, boatswain,\r\ntwo deck hands, cook, two engineers and a fireman.\r\n\r\nOn the fishing grounds, fishing is continuous. The net is trawled for\r\nfrom two to four hours, although on grounds where fish is plentiful\r\n(e.g. Iceland) the trawl is frequently hauled every half-hour. It is\r\nthen hauled aboard, and the cod end containing the fish is swung over\r\nthe deck. The cod line is unfastened so that the cod end of the net\r\nopens, and the fish are discharged into a pound formed on the deck by\r\nhorizontal 9″ × 3″ deal boards. The net is cleaned and shot again.\r\n\r\nOn smooth ground trawling is commercially possible at all depths down\r\nto 300 fathoms. In few cases, however, is trawling carried on at\r\ngreater depths than 200 fathoms.\r\n\r\nOwing to the large amount of stores and repairs, etc., connected\r\nwith the maintenance of a fleet of steam trawlers, most large owners\r\nmaintain fairly elaborate premises in the neighbourhood of the fish\r\ndock. These premises generally consist of a net-making hall in which\r\nnets are made by women working with shuttles, a large bath of tar or\r\ntanning material below in which the net is soaked, also a wood yard\r\nand blacksmith’s shop, containing a steam hammer, a plumber’s shop,\r\na boat-builder’s shop, a large store-room fitted with the necessary\r\nstores and spares.\r\n\r\nDuring the war the steam trawlers were commandeered by the Government\r\nfor use as patrol boats and mine sweepers. It is estimated that 10\r\nper cent of our steam trawlers and drifters and their crews were lost\r\nduring the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17\r\n\r\n  A.—The otter trawl.\r\n\r\n  B.—Attachment of board to net.

The line fisherman found that steam trawling\r\nmade it more difficult to catch demersal fish with baited hooks. He\r\nattributed this to the effect of over-fishing, but it is probable that\r\ncontact with the otter trawls had made the fish rather more shy and,\r\ntherefore, more difficult to catch by this method. It is unlikely that\r\nsteam trawling will lead to serious over-fishing, except possibly\r\namongst such sedentary fish as soles and plaice. It must be remembered\r\nthat trawling is only commercially possible on comparatively smooth\r\nground and down to depths of about 200 fathoms. Probably, therefore,\r\nthe actual area trawled is only a small proportion of the total area\r\nthat is inhabited by fish. It is possible, of course, that extensive\r\nand long continued trawling in a confined and relatively isolated area\r\nmay scare the fish away; it is probable, however, that any area in\r\nwhich over-fishing appears to have produced temporary exhaustion will\r\ntend to recover automatically, since it would naturally be abandoned\r\ntemporarily by the trawlers for more profitable fishing grounds.\r\nThere is no doubt that trawling, unless the size of the mesh is\r\ncarefully controlled, tends to remove large numbers of immature fish.\r\nGenerally in ordinary beam trawling—cod, plaice, haddock, etc.—the mesh\r\nvaries from 3 ins. diameter near the mouth of the net to about 1-1/4\r\nins. diameter at the cod end. If a much smaller mesh were used the\r\nresistance encountered by a full-sized net would be so great that it\r\nwould be almost impossible to draw the net through the water. Smaller\r\ntrawls of 1/2 in. mesh are used in shallow coastal waters for catching\r\nshrimps, small plaice and whiting. The size of mesh largely determines\r\nthe size of fish that will be retained by the net, since the smaller,\r\nimmature fish readily escape through the meshes. Of recent years the\r\nvarious fishery boards, with a view to preventing the catching of such\r\nsmall, immature fish, have increased the size of mesh that is to be\r\nused—particularly when trawling within the three mile limit, where the\r\ngreatest proportion of immature fish is generally encountered. For\r\nsteam trawlers working in deep water a 2-1/2 in. mesh is generally\r\nused, but within the three mile limit it is frequently increased from 3\r\nto 3-1/2 ins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18\r\n\r\nTHE CATCH ABOARD]\r\n\r\nHerring are caught with drift nets at night near the surface. In the\r\ndaytime they frequent the sea bottom and can then be caught with a\r\ntrawl net. Trawling for herrings was first practised by the fishermen\r\nof Milford Haven and Fleetwood in 1901. They used an ordinary otter\r\ntrawl lined with a piece of herring net. A specially constructed\r\nherring trawl is now used, of which the cod end is made of 2-1/2 in.\r\nmesh instead of the usual 3-1/2 in.\r\n\r\nWhen trawling for herrings the steamer goes at full speed, generally\r\nfor two to four hours, unless a shoal is encountered, when half-an-hour\r\nis frequently sufficient.\r\n\r\nHerrings are trawled in from 70 to 100 fathoms of water over a soft\r\nbottom. The main centre for trawled herrings is North-West of Ireland,\r\nother fisheries being carried on off the South-West of Ireland, the\r\nWest of Scotland, and in the North Sea. In 1913 over 500,000 cwts. of\r\nherrings were taken with trawl nets in these areas.\r\n\r\nThis method of catching herrings aroused serious opposition among the\r\ndrift net fishermen. They asserted that the trawl catches and destroys\r\na high proportion of immature fish, and also destroys the herring eggs\r\nas it passes along the sea bottom. In 1913 the matter was investigated\r\nby a Parliamentary Committee, but any Government action was checked by\r\nthe outbreak of war.\r\n\r\nSince 1905 the trawling grounds frequented by British steam trawlers\r\nhave been divided for statistical purposes into eighteen fishing areas.\r\nThe names and areas of these regions are shown in the chart of the\r\ntrawling grounds (Fig. 19).\r\n\r\nTable I shows in hundredweights the average catch per day’s absence\r\nfrom port in different areas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19\r\n\r\nCHART\r\n\r\nSHOWING\r\n\r\nTRAWLING GROUNDS\r\n\r\nFrequented by British Trawlers, the “Regions” into which they are\r\ndivided for statistical purposes, and the approximate area of each in\r\nsquare miles (Nautical) calculated from the 3 mile limit to the 200\r\nmetre line.\r\n\r\n  NO.

Trawl-caught fish—soles, plaice,\r\nturbot, halibut, cod—are much more valuable than fish caught by drift\r\nnets, e.g. herring and mackerel. In England and Wales, in 1913, the\r\nweight of pelagic fish caught amounted to 389,262 tons, and of demersal\r\nfish 418,038 tons. Although the quantity of the demersal fish was,\r\ntherefore, only little larger than of the pelagic fish, its value was\r\n£7,463,003, compared with £2,531,979, the value of the pelagic fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSHELLFISH\r\n\r\n\r\nShellfish are divided into two classes: Crustacea, including the\r\nlobster, crab, shrimp, prawn, and mollusca, including the oyster,\r\nmussel, cockle and periwinkle. Shellfish generally abound in\r\ncomparatively shallow water near the shore.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important members of the crustacea are the various\r\nminute, pelagic copepoda, of which incalculable myriads form an\r\nimportant constituent of the plankton in all seas. These copepoda live\r\nupon the diatoms and other microscopic, marine vegetable life floating\r\nat the surface of the sea. The most important edible members of the\r\ncrustacea are the lobster and the shrimp.\r\n\r\nThe lobster is found along the coasts of the North Atlantic and\r\nMediterranean, particularly along the European coasts from Norway\r\nto the Mediterranean, and off North America from Labrador to Cape\r\nHatteras, The lobster lives in shallow water at about 12 fathoms depth,\r\nand frequents a rocky bottom. The lobster’s eggs remain attached to\r\nthe female until the larvae hatch out. From 10,000 to 12,000 eggs\r\nare carried in this way by a female lobster. She protects them from\r\nthe ravages of fish that will otherwise consume them as food, and by\r\nkeeping them constantly irrigated with fresh sea-water she promotes\r\ntheir healthy life and development. The eggs may take as long as twelve\r\nmonths to hatch, and although “berried” lobsters are seen in greatest\r\nnumbers in the spring they are also captured at all seasons of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nWhen hatched the young lobster larvae leave their mother and float up\r\nto the surface water, where they develop for a time among the plankton.\r\nDuring the larval period the lobster is a free and active swimmer.\r\n\r\nThe young larvae are consumed in large quantities by fish such as\r\nherring, mackerel and sprat, especially during the summer months when\r\nthey are most abundant. While developing into a complete lobster it\r\npasses through at least three distinct changes of form. When the larva\r\nhas attained the length of about 3/5 in. it already possesses many of\r\nthe characteristic features of the adult. Soon afterwards, it sinks to\r\nthe sea bottom and gradually grows into a complete adult. During the\r\ngrowth of the lobster it frequently casts its shell and grows a new\r\none. Growth only takes place when the shell is cast and while the new\r\nshell is hardening. During the first few weeks of its life the lobster\r\ncasts its shell about once a week, but this casting happens less and\r\nless frequently as the lobster grows older. The new shell is formed\r\nbeneath the old one, and although at first quite soft rapidly hardens\r\nwhen the old one has been cast off. Most adult lobsters cast their\r\nshells in July, August and September.\r\n\r\nA lobster grows slowly, and when from 9 to 10 ins. long is probably\r\nfrom four to five years old. It becomes mature when about 6 ins.\r\nlong—that is when about three years old.\r\n\r\nThe lobster is usually caught in creels or “pots” baited with portions\r\nof stale fish—generally flounder, skate, eels, etc. Lobster fisheries\r\ntend to deteriorate in value very rapidly. Owing to the lobsters’ keen\r\nsense of smell, the method of capture by means of creels or pots is\r\nvery efficient, so that the lobsters are caught in great numbers, with\r\nthe result that the fishery soon shows signs of exhaustion, the average\r\nsize of the lobster caught becoming smaller. The lobster fishery is\r\nentirely confined to the shallow water near the shore, and can only\r\nbe replenished and maintained by the young lobsters that hatch out in\r\nthat neighbourhood. Large quantities of lobster spawn are destroyed\r\nevery year when berried lobsters are caught. It is estimated that, on\r\nan average, 30 per cent of the lobsters caught are berried females. The\r\nfishermen either remove the spawn and throw it back into the sea—where,\r\nof course, it almost certainly becomes fish food—or sell it to be used\r\nin making certain special sauces.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made by legislation in different countries\r\nto prevent the capture of berried females, and so protect the lobster\r\nspawn, but, since berried females are found all the year round and\r\ncomprise about 30 per cent of all the lobsters captured, it is\r\npractically impossible to prohibit the capture of berried lobsters\r\nwithout seriously penalizing the fishermen.\r\n\r\nA better policy would be to hatch lobster eggs in large numbers\r\nartificially, and when the young lobsters are well established add them\r\nto the natural stock. This is actually done on a large scale and with\r\nexcellent results in America and Norway.\r\n\r\nIn Europe lobsters are generally sent to market in a fresh state, but\r\nin America they form the basis of an extensive canning industry. In\r\n1913 over 2,500,000 lobsters were captured round the coasts of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, the total value of the fish being more than\r\n£110,000.\r\n\r\nShrimping is one of the most important methods of inshore fishing, and\r\ngives employment to a large number of fishermen round our coasts. The\r\nshrimp is found on sandy or muddy ground in shallow water near the\r\ncoast. A female shrimp, like the lobster and the crab, carries its eggs\r\nunder its tail.\r\n\r\nShrimps are caught with a fine-meshed trawl net, drawn by a boat or by\r\nhorse and cart, or with push nets or hose nets. One great objection to\r\nshrimping is that the shallow, sandy areas on which it takes place are\r\nmuch frequented by young fish—particularly dabs, plaice, soles, whiting\r\nand codling. Owing to the small mesh of the shrimp trawl, these small\r\nfish are captured in large numbers and are generally dead or dying when\r\ndischarged from the net. Generally, the shrimps are separated from the\r\nsmall fish by riddling, and the smaller shrimps are then separated from\r\nthe larger ones by a second riddling process, and are returned to the\r\nsea. The shrimps are thrown into boiling salt water, rapidly stirred\r\nfor a few seconds, and spread out on the deck to cool. From three to\r\nfour hauls are made per day, a good day’s fishing consisting of from 30\r\nto 40 quarts of shrimps. Large numbers of shrimps are potted.\r\n\r\nThe other important group of shellfish is the mollusca. Molluscs, i.e.\r\n“soft creatures,” are essentially soft, mobile animals, protected\r\nby shells. They are classed as bi-valves, for example oyster and\r\nmussel, and uni-valves, for example limpet and whelk. There is no real\r\ndifference between a bi-valve and a uni-valve, for what appear to be\r\nthe two shells of the bi-valve are really one shell divided into two\r\nparts by a line of soft, uncalcified material which forms a hinge\r\nbetween the two halves of the shell; this hinge tends to keep the shell\r\nopen, but the muscular action of the living animal inside keeps it\r\nclosed when required.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the mussel, very few shellfish actually live\r\non the shore between the tide marks. Most of the seashore shells are\r\nbrought by the sea from animals that lived in from 10 to 20 fathoms of\r\nwater. The cockle lives buried in the sand, about an inch below the\r\nsurface. The oyster lives on stones and shells below low-water mark.\r\n\r\nAll molluscs are attached tightly to the shell at one or two points,\r\nand cannot be removed from the shell alive. In the case of the\r\nbi-valves the animal is attached to the two shells by a muscle which\r\ndraws the two valves of the bi-valve together. When this muscle is\r\nrelaxed, for example in normal circumstances, when feeding at the\r\nbottom of the sea—the shell remains open. Some shellfish—notably the\r\nscallop—actually swim by opening and shutting the two valves of their\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nThe most important uni-valves are the periwinkle, the limpet and the\r\nwhelk. Uni-valves possess a well-marked head and neck, a pair of eyes\r\nand a mouth. They are remarkable for the possession of a tongue, formed\r\nlike a ribbon rasp, furnished on its upper surface with a large number\r\nof small teeth. The number and arrangement of these teeth differ in\r\ndifferent species. With this ribbon rasp the uni-valve, for example a\r\ndog-whelk, can rasp a hole through the shell of an oyster and feed upon\r\nthe contents.\r\n\r\nBi-valves do not possess a ribbon rasp, neither have they a projecting\r\nhead, nor in most cases any eye. They possess a mouth, furnished with\r\nfour flapper-like lips or gill plates. They feed on microscopic,\r\nfloating plants that are drawn within their mouth by currents set up\r\nin the water by the rhythmic vibrations—from three to four hundred\r\nstrokes per minute—of millions of hairs that hang down from soft\r\nplates supported under the protecting arch of the shell and called\r\nthe “beard.” These currents of water not only bring food to the mouth\r\nof the bi-valve, but also irrigate the gill plates and so enable the\r\nanimal to breathe. The oyster lies on the sea bottom with its muscle\r\nrelaxed and its shell gaping.\r\n\r\nA North European oyster acts alternately as female and male. It\r\nproduces eggs—as many as a million in a season—and a fortnight\r\nafter the eggs have been shed, the same oyster produces millions of\r\nspermatazoa, which form a cloud of fine dust in the water. These\r\nspermatazoa rapidly scatter in all directions, and, entering the\r\ntubular reproductive sacs of oysters that are producing eggs, fertilize\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAmerican and Portuguese oysters are definitely male and female, the\r\neggs being discharged by the female and fertilized subsequently in the\r\nsea by the male.\r\n\r\nThe eggs remain attached to the parent’s gill plates, and in a day or\r\nso develop into minute, shell-less oysters. The parent oyster is then\r\nsaid to be “white-sick.” About two days later the young oysters have\r\nbecome dark-coloured and are found to have formed minute convex shells,\r\nrather like those of a cockle. The parent is then “black-sick.” A week\r\nlater the young oysters escape and rise in thousands to the surface\r\nwater, swimming by means of fine hairs or cilia that are attached to\r\nthe upper edge of the shells. They are carried far and wide by tides\r\nand surface currents. Many are eaten by young fish and shrimps. As\r\nthey grow the shells become heavier, and after a time they sink to the\r\nsea bottom. This is known as the “fall of spat.” If they fall on stony\r\nground, where they will be well irrigated and nourished through the\r\nmovement of the water, they will thrive. Many, however, fall on soft,\r\nunsuitable ground and perish.\r\n\r\nThe European oysters spawn in the summer (from May to September). They\r\nbecome mature in three years, are at their prime in from five to seven\r\nyears, and rarely live longer than ten years.\r\n\r\nOysters are gathered from natural beds or from artificial grounds.\r\nThe oyster breeders place movable tiles or frames for the spat to\r\nfall on. When the young have become affixed to these “stools” they are\r\nfrequently carried away to develop in a different locality. The oysters\r\nare finally fattened in sea ponds or inlets that contain a large diatom\r\npopulation. At Marennes, on the west coast of France, the water in\r\nwhich the oysters are grown contains a particular blue diatom. After\r\nfeeding upon these diatoms, the beard of the oyster becomes stained a\r\nbluish-green colour—the well-known “Marennes vertes” oysters.\r\n\r\nA natural oyster bed is formed on stony ground free from mud and\r\nsand, so that the oyster, after becoming attached to a stone, is\r\ncompletely surrounded by clear sea-water. Oysters do not flourish in\r\nwater containing less salt than ordinary sea-water. Thus, there are no\r\noysters in the Baltic Sea.\r\n\r\nThe chief enemies of the oyster are the dog-whelk that bores through\r\nthe shell, and the starfish that pulls the valves apart and attacks the\r\noyster inside.\r\n\r\nThe oyster is widely distributed in tropical and temperate seas all\r\nover the world. The approximate value of the annual oyster crop of the\r\nworld is £4,000,000, representing a crop of 10 billion oysters.\r\n\r\nIn Europe up to 75 per cent of the oysters are reared from spat in\r\nartificial beds—not more than 7 per cent being “native.” In the United\r\nStates, however, over 40 per cent are still obtained from natural beds.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of oyster culture is the preservation of the\r\nnatural bed. These beds are easily destroyed or made unproductive by\r\nover-dredging. Colonies are broken up. Other animals are admitted.\r\nBreeding oysters are covered up by stones and shells, and suffocated.\r\nRidges suitable for the development of the spat are broken down.\r\n\r\nAfter the beds have been properly protected and preserved the next\r\nstage is to extend the area of the natural beds. This involves a\r\nknowledge of the conditions of depth, temperature, salinity and\r\ncharacter of bottom that are necessary to the successful growth of the\r\noyster. Finally the productivity of an oyster “park” and the quality of\r\nits produce can be greatly improved by providing artificial “stools”\r\nfor the reception and development of the spat. Many substances can be\r\nused for this purpose. The Romans used earthenware tiles, and similar\r\ntiles are used to this day in France. Brushwood, trees, stones and\r\nstakes, and old oyster shells (cultch) are also used.\r\n\r\nThe earthenware tiles used in France are hollowed on one side to\r\nreceive the spat, and are coated with lime to facilitate the removal of\r\nthe oysters when they are a year old. They are then from 1/2 to 1 inch\r\nin diameter, and are picked off the stools and placed on stands where\r\nthey are thinned out from time to time as they grow.\r\n\r\nThe chief oyster fisheries in Britain are at Whitstable, Colchester and\r\nBrightlingsea. Nearly 40,000,000 oysters were gathered on the coasts of\r\nEngland and Wales in 1920, and were sold for about £250,000.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the next most important edible bi-valve is the mussel.\r\nFrequently, mussel beds are situated near the mouth of rivers,\r\nand consequently tend to be contaminated by sewage. It has been\r\nestablished by various investigators—notably Dr. Klein and Professor\r\nJames Johnstone—that mussels are able to cleanse themselves of sewage\r\npollution in a comparatively short time if they are re-laid in\r\nsterilized water. Experiments on a large scale have been carried out\r\nwith the mussel beds at the mouth of the Conway river since September,\r\n1916. The mussels are gathered from the beds and placed about two deep\r\non wooden grids in a large concrete cleansing tank of 40,000 gallons\r\ncapacity. The mussels are first thoroughly hosed with water at high\r\npressure to remove all adherent mud, etc. The tank is then filled with\r\nsterilized sea-water and the mussels are allowed to remain in it for 24\r\nhours. During this period the mussels effectually free themselves from\r\nbacteria. The tank is then emptied, the mussels are hosed again, the\r\ntank is again filled with sterile water and after a further 24 hours is\r\nemptied. The mussels are once more flushed with the hose. After this\r\ntreatment the mussels reach a high standard of purity. The scheme has\r\nproved to be a complete success, not only from a scientific point of\r\nview, but also as a commercial proposition. The sum of 1s. per bag of\r\nmussels (140 lbs.) is charged to the fishermen for this treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFISHERIES FOR WHALES\r\n\r\n\r\nWhales are the most important members of a large family of land\r\nanimals including also the seals, walrus, and porpoise, that have\r\ngradually become adapted to live in the sea. They have acquired an\r\nexternally fish-like form, but in every other respect they retain the\r\ncharacteristic features of mammalian structure. They are warm-blooded,\r\nair-breathing quadrupeds, that suckle their young. In the whale, the\r\nfore-limbs have become simple five-fingered flippers, while only\r\nisolated, vestigial bones of the hind-limbs remain buried uselessly in\r\nthe body. Unlike fishes, the tail is set horizontally, thus enabling\r\nthe creature to rise easily to the surface to breathe. The warm-blooded\r\nbody is kept warm by a layer of fat placed immediately beneath the\r\nskin, and varying in thickness from 8 to 20 ins., and known as the\r\nblubber. The nostrils, instead of being situated at the end of the\r\nsnout, are placed far back at the apex of the head to form the blowhole.\r\n\r\nWhales are divided into two well-marked groups, known as the whaleboned\r\nand the toothed whales respectively, according to the particular form\r\nof their dentition.\r\n\r\nThe most important of the whaleboned whales is the Greenland, or Arctic\r\nRight, whale. It attains a length of upwards of 45 to 50 ft., and\r\nis remarkable for the enormous extent of its head and mouth cavity.\r\nThe head extends for a third of the length of the body, so that the\r\nmouth cavity may be as much as 18 ft. long, 12 ft. broad and 11 ft. in\r\nheight, the dimensions of a small chapel! The upper jaw is narrower\r\nthan the lower and arches backwards, thus increasing the actual\r\nheight of the mouth cavity and providing ample room for the blades of\r\nwhalebone with which the jaws are furnished in place of teeth. These\r\nblades of whalebone number about 380, and range in length from 8 ft.\r\nto, in exceptional cases, 12 ft. They are suspended in the mouth of the\r\nwhale like stalactites, set fairly close together, and, since the edges\r\nof each blade are fringed with fine whalebone, the whole arrangement\r\nforms a very efficient strainer. This enables the whale to feed upon\r\nthe plankton—or “krill,” as it is called by the whalers—and small\r\nfish, e.g. herring and capelan. The whale fills his enormous cavern of\r\na mouth with water containing the floating food particles, and then,\r\nby raising his tongue, slowly expels the water through the whalebone\r\nsieve. The food particles are retained by the whalebone, and are then\r\nlicked off and swallowed.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland whale inhabits the Arctic seas north of latitude 54°N.\r\nA closely related variety, the Bowhead whale, forms the basis of a\r\nfishery in the Behring Sea.\r\n\r\nThe largest whales known are the so-called Rorqual whales. The name of\r\nthese whales is derived from the large number of longitudinal folds or\r\npleatings that form a characteristic feature of their throat. Rorqual\r\nwhales attain a length of from 80 to 85 ft. The head is relatively\r\nsmall, and the long, slender body carries a distinct dorsal fin. The\r\nwhalebone is coarse and short. The Rorqual whales are the most abundant\r\nand widely distributed of all whales. They are found in all open seas,\r\nwith the exception of those in the extreme Arctic and Antarctic regions.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Right whale, or Black whale, is found in the temperate\r\nseas of both Northern and Southern hemispheres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20\r\n\r\nA WHALE’S MOUTH\r\n\r\nThe carcass is ready for cutting up at a Shetland whaling station.]\r\n\r\nOf the toothed whales, the most important is the Cachalot or Sperm\r\nwhale. It is chiefly captured in Southern seas, and is killed in\r\nlarge numbers for the sake of the spermaceti and sperm oil that occur\r\nin large quantities in its head cavity. Sperm and other toothed whales\r\nfeed upon fish and cuttlefish.\r\n\r\nThe breeding habits and migrations of the different species of whales\r\nare at present little understood. During the summer, when the water in\r\nthe Polar circles swarms with certain varieties of pelagic crustacea,\r\nthe whales congregate in these regions and are then most profitably\r\nhunted. At the end of the summer they appear to migrate towards warmer\r\nwater nearer the Equator. They bring forth their young in warm, shallow\r\nwater, and return to the whaling grounds in the spring. A young whale\r\ncalf may be as much as 20 ft. long at birth.\r\n\r\nWhales were captured by the Norwegians over 1,000 years ago. In the\r\nMiddle Ages—from the ninth to the seventeenth centuries—the Basques\r\nhunted the Black whale in the Bay of Biscay, and supplied Europe\r\nwith oil and whalebone. Towards the end of the sixteenth century,\r\nas the Biscay whales became rare and more difficult to find, the\r\nwhalers ventured further afield, and in 1612 discovered the Greenland\r\nwhale. The Black or Biscay whale is now almost extinct, and there is\r\nevery likelihood that the Greenland Right whale will also soon be\r\nexterminated. The capture of Sperm and Rorqual whales, although equally\r\nimportant, is a comparatively modern development.\r\n\r\nModern whale fishing has become a very efficient art, owing largely\r\nto the invention of the shot-harpoon by a Norwegian, Sven Foyn, in\r\n1870. This harpoon is discharged from a gun from the deck of a fast\r\nsteamship. It penetrates the body of the whale in the vital region just\r\nbehind the flipper. The invention of this weapon has made the killing\r\nof whales a matter of comparative ease and certainty. The inevitable\r\nconsequence of this is that the whales are being killed in such large\r\nnumbers that they are in danger of general extermination. Even before\r\nthe introduction of the shot-harpoon, whales were being destroyed at\r\nan astonishing rate. Thus, during 40 years in the middle of the last\r\ncentury, over 300,000 whales were captured by the United States whale\r\nfisheries alone. The value of these whales was £65,000,000, so that\r\neach whale realized on an average £216. Of recent years—before 1914—a\r\nsingle large Greenland whale has realized as much as £900 for whalebone\r\nand £300 for oil. At the present time, over 20,000 whales are killed\r\neach year.\r\n\r\nThe old eighteenth century whaler of about 400 tons burden carried\r\nabout 30 officers and men, and was equipped for a three years’ voyage.\r\nEach whaler carried six whale boats. These whaleboats were about 27 ft.\r\nlong and built sharp at each end. Each boat was furnished with mast and\r\nsails, and was provided with two 200-fathom whale lines. When a whale\r\nwas sighted four of these boats, each manned by six men, started in\r\npursuit. The boats ranged themselves alongside the whale and a harpoon\r\nwas driven into it from each boat. The whale immediately dived to the\r\nbottom of the sea and remained there sometimes for as long as forty\r\nminutes. When he returned to the surface to breathe, more harpoons were\r\nthrown and he dived again. Ultimately, owing to loss of blood, the\r\nwhale kept near the surface and was then dispatched by a lance thrust\r\nbehind the flipper into the vital parts.\r\n\r\nThe modern Greenland whaler is an iron vessel of about 500 tons. She\r\nis fitted with auxiliary engines of 75 horse-power. She carries from\r\nfifty to sixty hands and eight whaleboats. She is fitted with tanks for\r\n250 tons of oil. Before the war she would cost about £17,500 to build\r\nand £500 a month to maintain. Each whaleboat carries a harpoon gun in\r\norder to make sure of the first harpoon getting a good hold.\r\n\r\nIn Rorqual fishing, off Newfoundland, the harpoon is tipped with a bomb\r\nand time fuse. This explosive harpoon is discharged into the whale from\r\nthe deck of the whaler—a fast steamer—and explodes with fatal effect.\r\n\r\nThe chief whale fisheries are carried on off Greenland for the\r\nGreenland whale, off the coast of Newfoundland for Rorquals. There\r\nis the Norwegian bottlenosed-whale fishery around Iceland, and the\r\nAmerican Bowhead-whale fishery in the Behring Sea. In Southern Seas\r\nthe Humpback, Fin whale, and Blue whale (Sibbald’s Rorqual) constitute\r\nan overwhelming majority of the whales captured. The Right whale and\r\nthe Sperm whale, although captured in relatively small numbers, are\r\nindividually more valuable. Other smaller species, e.g. the Sei whale\r\n(Rudolph’s Rorqual), the lesser Rorqual and the Killer or Grampus, are\r\nalso found in large numbers in the Antarctic.\r\n\r\nWhen the whale has been killed it is either made fast alongside the\r\nwhaler and cut up, or it is towed ashore to a “factory” to be cut up\r\nand stripped. The blubber is stripped off, cut up into small pieces,\r\nand boiled down with water to separate the oil. The yield of oil varies\r\nfor different species, as shown in Table II. The whalebone is removed\r\nand, if a Sperm whale, the oil is removed from the skull cavity with\r\nbuckets. An average large Sperm whale will yield from 2-1/2 to 3 tons\r\nof Sperm oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II\r\n\r\n                         Average Yield of Oil in Barrels\r\n  Species of Whale.

Nos. 0\r\nand 1 are made entirely from blubber; No. 2 from tongues and kidney fat\r\nand from the residue of the blubber boilings; No. 3 is made from the\r\nflesh and bones, and No. 4 from refuse. The different grades contain\r\nprogressively from 1/2 to 1 per cent water and dirt, and from 2 to 30\r\nper cent free fatty acid.\r\n\r\nGrades 0, 1 and 2 of whale oil are used in the manufacture of soap,\r\nglycerine being obtained from it as a by-product. In its natural\r\ncondition the oil is soft, and has to be “hardened” before it can be\r\nused for soap making. The hardened whale oil is white, odourless and\r\ntasteless, and is an excellent substitute for tallow. In this condition\r\nit is also used as a substitute for lard and, to a small extent, is\r\nused in making margarine.\r\n\r\nGrades 3 and 4 are used in the manufacture of lubricating greases.\r\nWhale oil alone is used for shafting and machinery bearings. When mixed\r\nwith mineral oil, it is used for looms, spindles and textile machinery.\r\nWhale oil is also used as an illuminant, for currying leather, and in\r\nmaking chamois leather, for batching flax and other vegetable fibres,\r\nand in oiling wool for combing.\r\n\r\nIn 1913, the world’s annual catch of whale oil had reached 800,000\r\nbarrels. During the war the supply was considerably less, for example\r\nin 1917 it was only 358,000 barrels.\r\n\r\n=Whalebone.= Whalebone from the mouths of the Right or whaleboned\r\nwhales is in considerable demand among dressmakers and milliners.\r\nIts principal use is in the brush trade, chiefly in making brushes\r\nfor mechanical purposes. It is prepared for use by being boiled in\r\nwater for about 12 hours until it is quite soft. It is then cut into\r\nstrips or bristles or filaments, according to the use for which it is\r\nintended. It is light, flexible, tough and fibrous.\r\n\r\n=Sperm Oil.= Sperm oil is really a liquid wax. It is an excellent\r\nlubricant—particularly for rapidly moving machinery, e.g. spinning\r\nspindles, or for delicate machinery such as watches. It does not become\r\ngummy or rancid, and retains its viscosity at high temperatures. It has\r\nno corrosive action.\r\n\r\nWhen cooled to low temperatures, it deposits a solid\r\nwax—spermaceti—which is used in the manufacture of high grade candles.\r\nSperm oil is also used for dressing leather, in oil tempering steel,\r\nand as an illuminant.\r\n\r\n=Ambergris.= Ambergris is a solid, fatty, inflammable substance, dull\r\ngrey in colour, which occurs as a concretion in the intestines of sperm\r\nwhales. It is generally found floating in the sea or on the shore. It\r\nis used in the perfume industry mixed with other perfumes.\r\n\r\nThe development of the whaling industry in the south seas has led to\r\nthe industrial development of previously uninhabited islands. On South\r\nGeorgia, which was previously uninhabited, actual industrial villages\r\nhave been established. A church has been erected, and there are three\r\nslips for cutting up the whales, two guano factories, reservoirs\r\nfor the oil, and houses for the staff. This Antarctic island has a\r\nfloating population of many hundreds of sailors and workmen. A doctor\r\nresides there during the whaling season and, since 1908, the British\r\nGovernment has established a post office in this polar land. In 1922\r\nthe eyes of all the world were turned to this far-away land, the Gate\r\nof the Antarctic, as the body of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the hero of the\r\nAntarctic, was laid to rest there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE CURING AND PRESERVATION OF FISH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preservation of fishes for use as food long after they have\r\nbeen caught is a matter of constantly increasing importance to the\r\nprosperity of the fishing industry. In most other food supplying\r\nindustries the produce can be kept fresh for the market comparatively\r\neasily. Dry grain will keep indefinitely; vegetables and fruits with\r\nproper care will generally remain “fresh” long enough to reach distant\r\nmarkets. Oxen, sheep and pigs may be transported to the market alive,\r\nand then slaughtered as required. But a fish as soon as it is taken\r\nfrom the water dies and speedily begins to decay.\r\n\r\nFish, like other foodstuffs, whether animal or vegetable, decays as\r\na result of the growth in it and on it of certain micro-organisms\r\n(bacteria, moulds). These micro-organisms swarm in the air and on\r\nexposed surfaces all the world over. Generally speaking, they flourish\r\nbest at ordinary temperatures and in a moist environment.\r\n\r\nFoodstuffs can be preserved from decay only by preventing the growth\r\nand development of these decay organisms. They can be killed outright\r\nby any of the ordinary sterilizing processes such as exposure to\r\nsufficient extremes of heat or cold, or by treatment with disinfectant\r\nsubstances (germicides) such as carbolic acid or hypochlorites.\r\nClearly, however, foodstuffs cannot be preserved indefinitely by the\r\nsimple process of killing all the organisms that are resident on the\r\nfoodstuff at the time of treatment, for, as soon as the foodstuff is\r\nexposed to the air, it will become infected afresh.\r\n\r\nThey can be preserved—\r\n\r\n(1) By boiling, and packing immediately afterwards in air-free\r\ncontainers.\r\n\r\nThis process is, of course, the basis of the great meat packing\r\nindustry. The meat is packed in a tin, the tin and its contents are\r\nheated in steam or boiling water until the meat is cooked and all the\r\ndecay organisms are destroyed. The tin is then sealed, air-free and\r\nair-tight.\r\n\r\n(2) By freezing.\r\n\r\nCold storage is a widely used method of preserving foodstuffs. The low\r\ntemperature prevents the growth and development of decay organisms and,\r\nas long as the foodstuff is kept sufficiently cold, arrests decay.\r\n\r\nPrehistoric animals long extinct are sometimes found firmly embedded in\r\nthe Polar ice, as fresh as they were on the day they were drowned.\r\n\r\nIt is found that the stability and subsequent quality of frozen meat or\r\nfish depend directly upon the manner in which it has been frozen. It\r\nmay be frozen in air, or when immersed in brine. Of these two methods\r\nthe latter is much quicker, because brine is over twenty-five times\r\nas good a conductor of heat as air is. During the slower air-freezing\r\nprocess the quality of the flesh is impaired by the separation of the\r\ncontained water into comparatively large crystals of ice. This leads to\r\nthe displacement of the membrane and tissues of the meat, so that in\r\nthawing again the meat drips and becomes tough. When immersed in brine\r\nfreezing occurs too rapidly for this separation of water to occur to\r\nany marked extent.\r\n\r\nThe keeping qualities of brine-frozen fish also are greater than those\r\nof air-frozen fish, owing to the protecting coating of ice which\r\neffectively prevents contact with bacteria or mould spores.\r\n\r\n(3) By drying.\r\n\r\nPrimitive man preserved his meat by drying it in the sun, or in\r\nthe smoke of a fire. To-day the preparation of fish, dried fruits,\r\ndesiccated vegetables, etc., is a world-wide industry.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, decay organisms can only develop in a moist\r\nenvironment. All fresh foodstuffs contain a large proportion of water.\r\nThe removal of this water effectively checks decay. Drying alone,\r\nhowever, does not always produce a permanent “cure,” as the foodstuff\r\nis always liable to get moist again. For that reason it is customary to\r\ncombine the drying process with treatment with an antiseptic substance\r\nsuch as salt. Smoke drying is better than sun drying, for although the\r\nultra-violet rays of the direct sunlight effectively kill bacteria and\r\nmould spores wood smoke contains antiseptic substances with which the\r\nmeat becomes impregnated, so that even the chance of any subsequent\r\ninfection is greatly reduced.\r\n\r\n(4) By treating with an antiseptic substance such as salt.\r\n\r\nAntiseptic substances differ from disinfectant substances in that they\r\ndo not kill micro-organisms, but only arrest their development.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, they are effective preserving agents, and do not make the\r\nfood poisonous or unpalatable.\r\n\r\nAll these methods can be, and are, used for preserving fish, the method\r\nmost commonly used being treatment with salt. Fish, however, are often\r\nkept in ice on board during a fishing trip and are then either packed\r\nin ice for transit under special storage conditions (if required fresh)\r\nor they are salted down.\r\n\r\n=Methods of Salting.= Different methods of salting are used, according\r\nto the character of the fish and the locality. The fish are either\r\ncleaned (split and gutted) or salted “round” (whole). In general, the\r\nmethod used is one of the following—\r\n\r\n(1) DRY-SALTING. The fish are cleaned, rolled in dry salt, and packed\r\nin layers in open casks. Each layer of fish is covered with a layer of\r\nsalt.\r\n\r\n(2) BRINE PICKLING. The fish are immersed in saturated brine, salt\r\nbeing added from day to day to restore the strength of the brine as it\r\nbecomes weakened by the water which it extracts from the fish.\r\n\r\n(3) KENCHING. The fish, either split or round, are piled in layers in\r\nthe hold of the ship, or on the floor of the warehouse, each layer\r\nbeing covered in turn with a layer of salt. The brine, as it forms, is\r\nallowed to drain away.\r\n\r\nOf all these three methods, the first is undoubtedly more effective,\r\nmore economical, and requires less attention than the second. The\r\nthird method is often used on board ship and sometimes on shore as\r\na temporary expedient when the catch is too large for the number of\r\ncontainers available.\r\n\r\nIn the dry-salt method, the fish are packed tightly in the casks, and\r\nare not afterwards disturbed. When cured they possess a characteristic\r\ndry, shrunken appearance.\r\n\r\nFish pickled in brine need attention every day. The brine has to be\r\nclosely watched so that it shall not become too weak. Fresh salt has to\r\nbe added daily, and the fish stirred up with wooden paddles to ensure\r\nuniform pickling.\r\n\r\nFish cured in this way are softer and more plump than those cured by\r\nthe dry-salting method.\r\n\r\nWhen a fish is packed in salt the salt rapidly extracts water from the\r\nflesh and a strong brine results.\r\n\r\nThe salt dissolves in the remaining flesh juices of the fish, and\r\nrapidly diffuses throughout the fish, thoroughly permeating it. By this\r\nprocess, therefore, the fish is partially dried and becomes thoroughly\r\nimpregnated with salt.\r\n\r\nThe gradual change in the composition of the flesh is reflected in the\r\nfollowing analysis—\r\n\r\n  ---------------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n               Sample.             |   %    |   %    |  %\r\n                                   | Water. |  NaCl. | Fat.\r\n  ---------------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n  Fresh herring, ungutted          | 67·33  |  0·63  | 13·78\r\n                                   |        |        |\r\n  Herring lightly salted, before   |        |        |\r\n    gutting                        | 66·33  |  1·27  | 12·11\r\n                                   |        |        |\r\n  Herring from rousing tub, gutted |        |        |\r\n    and salted, ready to pack into |        |        |\r\n    barrel                         | 61·09  |  1·41  | 16·14\r\n                                   |        |        |\r\n  Herring, after 7 days salted in  |        |        |\r\n    barrel                         | 52·67  |  7·43  | 17·10\r\n                                   |        |        |\r\n  Herring, after 8 days salted in  |        |        |\r\n    barrel                         | 46·90  | 11·49  | 22·50\r\n  ---------------------------------+--------+--------+-------\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of the cure and the appearance of the finished product\r\nwill be influenced by the following factors—\r\n\r\n  (_a_) The temperature—whether summer or winter;\r\n  (_b_) The freshness of the fish;\r\n  (_c_) The quality of the salt—its purity and grain;\r\n  (_d_) The quantity of salt used;\r\n  (_e_) The duration of the process.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Temperature._ As soon as a fish is dead, it commences to\r\ndecay.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, decay proceeds more rapidly and the interior portion\r\nof the meat may become soured before the salt reaches it. Clearly, if\r\nthe rate at which the salt penetrates the fish is retarded by the salt\r\nbeing impure, or of too fine a grain, or by the brine being too weak,\r\nthe probability of the fish being spoilt is very much increased.\r\n\r\nThe dry salt method leads to a much quicker penetration of the fish\r\nthan the brine method, and should always be used in warm weather.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Freshness of the Fish._ The decay processes gather impetus\r\nday by day. It is clear, therefore, that in order to avoid the\r\npossibility of “souring,” the fish should be salted with the least\r\npossible delay.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Quality of the Salt._ (1) _Its Purity._ The impurities\r\ncommonly present in Fishery Salt are the sulphates and chlorides of\r\ncalcium and magnesium.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis show the composition of typical samples of\r\nFishery Salt.\r\n\r\n  -----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                         | German |        |        |        |\r\n        Composition.     |  Rock  |Italian.|Spanish.|French. |English.\r\n                         |  Salt. |        |        |        |\r\n  -----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                         |    %   |    %   |    %   |    %   |    %\r\n  Salt (Sodium chloride) |  97·28 |  96·59 |  96·63 |  95·86 |  98·9\r\n                         |        |        |        |        |\r\n  Calcium chloride       |   --   |   0·32 |   --   |   0·16 |   --\r\n                         |        |        |        |        |\r\n  Magnesium chloride     |   0·25 |   1·19 |   0·96 |   0·35 |   0·08\r\n                         |        |        |        |        |\r\n  Magnesium sulphate     |   --   |   1·75 |   0·73 |   --   |   --\r\n                         |        |        |        |        |\r\n  Sodium sulphate        |   0·44 |   --   |   --   |   --   |   0·04\r\n                         |        |        |        |        |\r\n  Sodium bicarbonate     |   0·01 |   --   |   --   |   --   |   --\r\n                         |        |        |        |        |\r\n  Insoluble (Calcium     |        |        |        |        |\r\n    sulphate, sand, etc.)|   2·02 |   0·15 |   1·68 |   3·63 |   0·98\r\n  -----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n                         | 100·00 | 100·00 | 100·00 | 100·00 | 100·00\r\n                         +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n  Moisture               |   0·20 |   6·54 |   4·47 |   1·39 |   3·25\r\n  -----------------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n\r\nThe Spanish and Italian salts are solar salts, obtained by evaporating\r\nsea-water by the heat of the sun. Solar salt nearly always contains\r\nmore magnesium salts than brine salt does. This constitutes a serious\r\ndisadvantage to the fish curer.\r\n\r\nOf the calcium salts which occur as impurities in Fishery Salt, the\r\nsulphate is practically insoluble in brine, and is probably without\r\naction upon the salting process.\r\n\r\nCalcium chloride, on the other hand, resembles magnesium chloride and\r\nis an undesirable constituent of Fishery Salt, for calcium chloride,\r\nand to a lesser extent magnesium chloride and magnesium sulphate,\r\ndiminish the rate at which the salt penetrates the fish. Curing will,\r\ntherefore, be delayed, and in warm weather (above 70°F.) this may\r\nresult in the souring of the fish.\r\n\r\nTo obtain rapid and thorough curing, therefore, it is\r\nnecessary—especially in warm weather—to use salt which contains as\r\nlittle calcium and magnesium salts as possible.\r\n\r\nPure salt, used dry, produces a soft, yellow-meated fish which is\r\nflexible in the hand. Salt containing calcium chloride or magnesium\r\nchloride produces a harder and stiffer fish with a markedly whiter\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nSalted fish can only be stored satisfactorily in a dry place. Fish\r\nwhich has been cured with impure salt is hygroscopic and will run wet\r\nin the store.\r\n\r\nThis hygroscopic moisture weakens the preserving action of the salt.\r\nFish that has been cured with a pure salt will keep much drier under\r\nordinary storage conditions.\r\n\r\n(2) _Its Grain._ The crystals of Fishery Salt should be coarse and\r\nhard. Coarse crystals dissolve slowly, and so produce a more gradual\r\ncure than fine-grained salt does. Fine-grained salt extracts the water\r\nso rapidly from the surface tissues that it coagulates them. This\r\nretards the further penetration of the salt into the fish, so that the\r\nfish has the appearance of being slack salted.\r\n\r\n=Round versus Cleaned Fish.= The thoroughness with which a cut fish is\r\ncleaned and washed influences the temperature at which the fish can\r\nbe salted successfully, and materially affects the quality and taste\r\nof the product. Tressler[1] has shown that the chief cause of fish\r\nspoiling when salted in hot weather is the decomposition of the blood\r\nwhich remains in the flesh. Even in cold weather, it is found that the\r\nextra washing and cleaning greatly improve the quality of the fish. As\r\nthe presence of blood in the fish also leads to discolouration during\r\nthe salting process, a thoroughly cleaned and washed fish is, after\r\nsalting, much whiter in appearance and has a finer taste.\r\n\r\nMany fish are skinned before they are salted. It has been observed that\r\na skinned fish will cure almost twice as quickly as an unskinned fish.\r\nThis is because salt penetrates the meat of the fish at approximately\r\ntwice the rate at which it penetrates the skin. It is desirable,\r\ntherefore, particularly in hot climates, to skin the fish before\r\nsalting. This, of course, is only commercially practicable with certain\r\nlarge kinds of fish such as cod.\r\n\r\n=The Reddening of Salted Fish.= Salted fish sometimes undergo a change,\r\neither during the salting process if improperly carried out, or more\r\ngenerally in the store, which is characterized by the development\r\non the surface of the fish of irregular red and brown patches. This\r\nreddening occurs not only on the fish, but also on the floors and walls\r\nof the curing factories, on the sides and decks of fishing boats, and\r\neven on the salt itself. It occurs most readily in warm weather.\r\n\r\nThe reddening has been shown to be due to the growth of a\r\nmicro-organism (a micro-coccus). With this micro-coccus are generally\r\nassociated a bacillus and a micro-fungus which produce the brown mould\r\non the fish.\r\n\r\nFish become infected with these micro-organisms by contact with boats\r\nor docks or warehouses.\r\n\r\nEvery precaution should be taken to keep such places clean and properly\r\ndisinfected.\r\n\r\nThe “rusting” of fatty fish, e.g. herring, is due to the oxidation of\r\ncertain free, fatty acids split off from the fats by enzyme action.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Document No. 884 (1920).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE FOOD VALUE OF FISH\r\n\r\n\r\nWith few exceptions, the different species of fishes that are caught\r\nindustrially are important because of their food value.\r\n\r\nSome fishes are unsuitable for food because they have an unattractive\r\ntaste; others are directly poisonous. Thus, in the Japanese fish of the\r\ngenus tetrodon, the roe is poisonous, although the remainder of the\r\nfish is edible. Some fishes are poisonous during the spawning season.\r\nOthers are provided with a special poison gland connected with special\r\nspines or barbs. In edible fishes, given the suitable conditions,\r\npoisons may be formed by bacterial activity in the flesh of the fish.\r\nPoisons so formed give rise to the kind of fish poisoning known as\r\nbotulism. Cases of botulism have resulted from eating canned salmon and\r\nsardines that have become spoiled. In some cases, bacteria present in a\r\ndiseased fish may produce poisonous substances in the body of the fish.\r\nBacillus paratyphosus has been isolated from some poisonous fish, and\r\ncertain poison-producing bacteria have been found in others.[2]\r\n\r\nCertain shellfish are notoriously liable to be poisonous. The exact\r\nnature of the microbes concerned in the production of poisonous\r\nsubstances in shellfish is at present unknown; it is clear, however,\r\nthat such poisonous substances may be produced in shellfish in three\r\nways—\r\n\r\n(1) Microbes of various infectious diseases, such as typhoid fever, may\r\nbe absorbed by the shellfish from sewage.\r\n\r\n(2) The shellfish may be diseased, or be seriously contaminated, by\r\nliving in dirty water.\r\n\r\n(3) Decomposition may set in after the shellfish have been removed from\r\nthe water—particularly if they have been kept too long in a warm place.\r\n\r\nIt has been found recently that shellfish that have been deliberately\r\nfattened on sewage can be effectively cleansed in such a way as to\r\nget rid of ingested sewage bacteria. This process has been carried\r\nout successfully on a commercial scale at Conway by the Ministry of\r\nAgriculture and Fisheries. Danger from infected shellfish may also be\r\nsafely avoided by boiling them. When shellfish are gathered at the\r\nright season of the year and from suitable localities, they are a\r\nperfectly safe and wholesome food.\r\n\r\nOf the many species of edible fishes that are known and used, the\r\nnumber is by no means complete, and new species are added from time to\r\ntime. Thus, in 1916, the United States Bureau of Fisheries introduced\r\na new edible fish (_Lopholatilus chamaeleonticeps_), which they\r\nchristened the tile fish. After this fishery had been in existence for\r\ntwelve months, the known catch of tile fish amounted to over 10,000,000\r\nlbs., valued at more than $400,000. In 1917, the same Bureau introduced\r\nthe dog-fish under a new name. As people were prejudiced against the\r\nname “dog fish,” the Bureau altered it to “gray fish,” “which is\r\ndescriptive, not preoccupied, and altogether unobjectionable.” The\r\nfish is now caught in large numbers, and forms the basis of a very\r\nflourishing canning industry. Attempts have been made recently to\r\nutilize as food the edible portions of the shark (which is closely\r\nrelated to the dog fish) and the porpoise.\r\n\r\nThe food value of most fishes varies very much according to the\r\ncondition of the fish when it is caught—that is whether it is spawning\r\nor not. Further, it may be considerably modified by the changes that\r\ntake place subsequently in the composition of the flesh during the\r\nprocesses of curing, cooking or preserving.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, all marine fish annually pass through a well-marked\r\nseries of seasonal changes, the stages of which appear to depend upon\r\nchanges in the temperature, salinity and alkalinity of the sea. These\r\nchanges are directly connected with the development of roe and milt,\r\nwith the fluctuation in the percentage of oil and fat in the liver\r\nand body tissues, and also with the rate of growth. Thus the chemical\r\ncomposition of the fish, and hence its food value, varies greatly\r\naccording to the season at which it is caught.\r\n\r\nNorwegian brisling (“Skipper Sardines”) are caught in the summer just\r\nbefore spawning time. At this time the fat content is high; in winter\r\nthe fat content is low, and the fish possesses small commercial value.\r\n\r\nThe gradual change in the composition and food value (in calories per\r\npound) of the herring as spawning time approaches is well shown in\r\nTable III. (Prof. J. Johnstone, Trans., Liverpool Biolog. Soc., Vol.\r\nxxxiii (1919), p. 106.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III\r\n\r\nMANX SUMMER HERRINGS, 1916\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF THE FLESH OF THE FISH: MONTHLY MEANS\r\n\r\n  ------+----------+------+-------+--------+------+------+-------\r\n   Date.|Condition.|Water.|Oil and|Proteid.| Ash. |Total.|  Food\r\n        |          |      |  Fat. |        |      |      | Value.\r\n  ------+----------+------+-------+--------+------+------+-------\r\n  May   |Empty     | 75·0 |  2·5  |  21·1  |  2·3 |100·9 | 1,100\r\n  June  |Filling   | 66·1 | 11·4  |  18·6  |  2·0 | 98·1 | 1,806\r\n  July  |Filling   | 55·8 | 21·6  |  18·4  |  2·3 | 98·1 | 2,762\r\n  August|Half full | 48·4 | 31·5  |  16·5  |  2·3 | 98·7 | 3,608\r\n  Sept. |Full      | 51·9 | 25·2  |  17·3  |  2·6 | 97·0 | 3,050\r\n  ------+----------+------+-------+--------+------+------+-------\r\n\r\nThe herrings are caught in September when they assemble in shoals for\r\nthe purpose of spawning. They are thus most easily caught at the time\r\nwhen their food value is at a maximum.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of clupeoid fish—herrings, sprats, pilchards,\r\nsardines—contains a quantity of oil disseminated throughout the flesh\r\nin the form of fine globules. From the above table it will be seen that\r\nthe percentage of oil in the flesh of the herring may be as low as 2·5\r\nper cent in May, and as much as 31·5 per cent in August. In summer the\r\nadipose tissue forms two distinct layers, one situated just below the\r\nskin, the other being parallel to the first, but separated from it by\r\na layer of muscular tissue. In winter the oil content becomes so small\r\nthat these layers of adipose tissue disappear. A comparatively small\r\namount of oil is contained in the liver of the fish.\r\n\r\nIn gadoid fishes, e.g. cod, as well as in skates and rays, the oil is\r\nalmost entirely confined to the liver. During the summer the liver\r\ngrows larger and richer in oil, until sometimes the oil amounts to\r\nmore than half the total weight of the liver. (When cod are caught the\r\nlivers are removed and kept apart, to be treated subsequently for their\r\noil.) The percentage of oil in the flesh of the cod varies from 0·1 per\r\ncent to 1·0 per cent. Unlike that of the herring, therefore, the food\r\nvalue of the flesh of the cod does not fluctuate markedly according to\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\nWhen fish are dry-salted a certain proportion of the proteins and\r\nmineral salts in the flesh is extracted by the brine pickle that is\r\nformed. In Russia and Poland, where the greater proportion of salted\r\nherrings are consumed, the peasants eat them without further cooking,\r\nand also consume the pickle.\r\n\r\nA great gain in food value per pound results from the removal of\r\nso much water from the flesh of the fish. Freshly caught cod flesh\r\ncontains about 80 per cent water and 17 per cent protein; after being\r\ndry-salted for export it contains about 25 per cent of water and 55 per\r\ncent protein.\r\n\r\nThus, 1 lb. of dry cod is equal in food value to about 3 lbs. of fresh\r\ncod. The increased food value of salted fish will be seen from the\r\nfollowing analyses—\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EFFECT OF CURING AND DRYING UPON THE FOOD VALUE OF DIFFERENT FISHES\r\n\r\n  -----------------+--------+------+-------------+-----+------+-------\r\n        Food.      |Protein.| Fat. |Carbohydrate.| Ash.|Water.|Food\r\n                   |        |      |             |     |      |Value.\r\n  -----------------+--------+------+-------------+-----+------+-------\r\n                   |        |      |             |     |      | Cal.\r\n                   |        |      |             |     |      |per lb.\r\n  Haddock (fresh)  |  12·0  |  0·2 |      —      | 0·9 | 51·6 |  232\r\n    „     (smoked) |  14·9  |  0·2 |      —      | 3·4 | 57·4 |  286\r\n  Herring (fresh)  |  14·0  | 10·4 |      —      | 1·5 | 45·7 |  699\r\n    „     (salted) |  21·2  | 15·4 |      —      | 7·7 | 30·9 |  944\r\n    „     (bloater)|  15·7  |  9·6 |      —      | 1·5 | 52·0 |  697\r\n    „     (kipper) |  14·1  | 11·1 |      —      | 3·4 | 46·9 |  730\r\n  Sprats  (fresh)  |  12·6  | 10·7 |      —      | 1·3 | 49·4 |  686\r\n    „     (smoked) |  21·2  | 14·9 |      —      | 3·2 | 39·4 |1,023\r\n  -----------------+--------+------+-------------+-----+------+-------\r\n\r\nThus, the food value of salted sprats or herrings per pound is 50 per\r\ncent more than that of the same fish when fresh.\r\n\r\nThe original food value of a fish is generally diminished by the\r\ncooking process. The fish may be boiled or broiled for direct\r\nconsumption, or it may be steam cooked in cans and sealed up for future\r\nconsumption, as in the canning industry. When oily fishes, such as\r\nherrings, are cooked, the oil globules burst and some of the oil is\r\nlost, and the food value of the fish becomes correspondingly less. When\r\nsalted fish is soaked in fresh water before being cooked, some of the\r\ngelatin and other coagulable proteins are extracted from the flesh.\r\nThis loss of protein can be checked either by broiling the fish, when\r\nthe protein near the surface becomes coagulated and so prevents the\r\nloss of protein from the interior of the fish, or by placing the fish\r\nthat is to be boiled direct into boiling water, and not into the cold\r\nwater before the heating has begun.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this diminution of the food content of the fish, the\r\nprocess of cooking, contrary to general expectation, also diminishes\r\nslightly its digestibility.\r\n\r\nIn the canning process the fish to be canned are cleaned (gutted)\r\nand boned, and packed into tins, together with the necessary sauce\r\nor seasoning. The tins are then closed, a small hole being left\r\ntemporarily in the lid. The tins are placed on steam-heated racks, and\r\nthe contents thoroughly cooked. In this way the contents are sterilized\r\nas well as cooked, and the air originally present in the tin is all\r\ndriven out by the steam through the small hole in the lid. This hole is\r\nsealed with a spot of solder while the contents of the tin are still\r\nat boiling point. The tin and its contents are allowed to cool down,\r\nand are dispatched to the store-room. During storage the contents of\r\nthe sealed tin gradually “mature.” This maturing process may last from\r\nsix months to ten years. During this period the bones soften, the flesh\r\nbecomes soft and pasty, and the taste becomes richer. The precise\r\nnature of the changes that take place during this maturing process is\r\nnot fully understood; probably maturing is partly due to the action of\r\ncertain enzymes in the flesh of the fish, and partly to the slow but\r\ncontinuous chemical action of the various juices present in the tin.\r\nAttempts to pickle herrings from the Zuyder Zee have been unsuccessful\r\nowing to a lack of the enzyme action that makes other herrings tender\r\nwhen pickled. The enzyme, although present, is apparently rendered\r\ninactive by the presence of an anti-enzyme.\r\n\r\nThe last, but by no means the least, important factor to be considered\r\nin estimating the food value of any particular fish is its retail\r\nprice. The price of the different kinds of fishes is by no means\r\nproportional to their individual food values. It is determined\r\nprimarily by the abundance or otherwise of the available supply of each\r\nindividual species. Thus, the various pelagic fish—mackerel, herring,\r\nsprat—that are easily caught in enormous quantities at certain seasons\r\nof the year are by far the most valuable. Of trawl-caught fish, cod\r\nand whiting are more plentiful and are, therefore, cheaper than hake,\r\nalthough, again, the cheaper fish has the greater food value.\r\n\r\nIn some cases certain fish, although fairly abundant, are in poor\r\ndemand owing to some prejudice on the part of the public, and are\r\ngenerally sold in poorer districts, or to the fried fish trade, at a\r\ndisproportionately low price, for example skate, dog-fish, angler fish,\r\njohn dory.\r\n\r\nTaste and appearance also contribute to the popularity and, therefore,\r\nindirectly to the retail price of fish, such as the sole and the salmon.\r\n\r\nIn Table IV the present retail prices (Sept., 1921) and the food values\r\nof a number of different fishes are compared. From these figures, the\r\nactual food value per shillingsworth of each fish has been calculated.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest fish, therefore, are also those possessing the greatest\r\nfood value, e.g. the herring in all its forms, dried cod and ling, and\r\nmackerel. These compare favourably both in cost and food value with\r\nmeat, such as beef and mutton.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV\r\n\r\nFOOD VALUE PER SHILLINGSWORTH OF DIFFERENT FISHES\r\n\r\n  -----------------+--------+------------+----------\r\n                   |        |   Retail   |Food Value\r\n        Fish.      |  Food  |   Price    |   per\r\n                   | Value. | Sept. 1921 |Shilling.\r\n  -----------------+--------+------------+----------\r\n                   |  Cals. |  per lb.   |\r\n                   | per lb.| _s._ _d._  |\r\n  Halibut (cuts)   |   258  |   2   3    |   115\r\n  Sole             |   346  |   2   6    |   138\r\n  Turbot           |   270  |   1   6    |   180\r\n  Brill            |   327  |   1   8    |   196\r\n  Haddock          |   232  |   1   2    |   198\r\n  Hake             |   256  |   1   3    |   204\r\n  Smoked haddock   |   286  |   1   3    |   228\r\n  Plaice           |   367  |   1   6    |   244\r\n  Cod (section)    |   296  |   1   1    |   252\r\n  Whiting          |   215  |   -  10    |   258\r\n  Salmon (section) |   847  |   3   -    |   282\r\n  Eels             |   799  |   1  10    |   436\r\n  Dried ling       |   560  |   1   -    |   560\r\n  Mackerel         |   515  |   -  10    |   618\r\n  Dried cod        |   750  |   1   -    |   750\r\n  Kippered herring |   730  |   -   9    |   972\r\n  Herring          |   709  |   -   8    |  1062\r\n  Bloaters         |   715  |   -   8    |  1072\r\n  Red herrings     |  1220  |   -   8    |  1830\r\n  Salt herrings    |  1129  |   -   5    |  2712\r\n  -----------------+--------+------------+----------\r\n\r\nFinally, the popularity or otherwise of any foodstuff necessarily\r\ndepends upon its flavour. Fishes differ greatly in this respect. In\r\nmany cases the flavour of a fish can be seriously impaired by an\r\nunsuitable method of cooking. A full-flavoured fish like the mackerel\r\nlends itself to a variety of methods of cooking, equally good results\r\nbeing obtained by baking, grilling, frying in fillets or boiling. The\r\nplaice, sole, ling, hake, mullet, and turbot are essentially fish for\r\nfrying, while cod, haddock and whiting are best boiled. To prepare a\r\nfish for the table requires considerable skill, but it is an art that,\r\nonce acquired, can be used to render even what are regarded as inferior\r\nvarieties both wholesome and palatable. In this country, fishes have\r\nlong been a neglected form of food. They have a high food value, they\r\nare easily digestible, and are cheap and plentiful.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown recently that edible fish contain vitamins. Vitamins\r\nare complex chemical compounds of hitherto unknown composition, and\r\nof little understood properties, that occur in minute quantities in\r\na great variety of natural food stuffs. These vitamins appear to\r\nbe essential to healthy animal existence. Without them, the body\r\nrapidly becomes attacked by certain diseases, e.g. rickets, beri-beri,\r\nscurvy, and unless this deficiency of the diet is corrected, death\r\nsoon follows. Three different vitamins have been discovered, known as\r\nvitamins A, B, and C. Vitamin A is contained in the oily part of most\r\nfish, while Vitamin B is present in certain fish roes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Marshall, _Microbiology_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFISH PRODUCTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe industrial value and importance of fishes is by no means limited\r\nto their use as food. They yield large quantities of valuable oil. The\r\nfish waste, or offal, chiefly heads, skins, bones and viscera—that\r\nis discarded by the fish curer, is worked up to yield fish glue,\r\nfertilizers and cattle food. The skins of certain large fishes, for\r\nexample the shark, are tanned and manufactured into a valuable leather.\r\n\r\nThe story of the fishing industry would not be complete without a brief\r\ndescription of the methods by which these products are manufactured.\r\n\r\n=Fish Oils.= The various kinds of oil that are obtained from different\r\nspecies of fish and other marine animals, such as whales and seals, may\r\nbe divided into three classes, according to the part of the fish from\r\nwhich they are extracted.\r\n\r\n(1) Fish oils proper are disseminated throughout the flesh of the fish\r\nin the form of fine globules. They are extracted from the entire fish,\r\ne.g. herring, sardine, sprat, menhaden.\r\n\r\n(2) Liver oils are located in the fish liver, e.g. cod, shark.\r\n\r\n(3) Blubber oils constitute a thick layer of adipose tissue just under\r\nthe skin of the marine mammalia, e.g. whale, seal, dolphin, porpoise.\r\n\r\nIn oily fish, such as herrings and sprats, each minute globule of oil\r\nis enclosed within a thin skin. It is practically impossible to rupture\r\nthis skin and liberate the oil simply by the application of pressure.\r\nWhen, however, these globules are heated the skin shrivels, the oil\r\nglobules expand and burst the skin, and the liquid oil is liberated and\r\ncan then be extracted from the flesh by pressure. To obtain the oil,\r\ntherefore, the fish are boiled or steam heated in large vats until the\r\noil is set free. The hot mass is then placed in a press and the oil\r\nsqueezed out. The residue is made into cattle food and fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn obtaining the best sorts of liver oils, e.g. codliver oil, the\r\nlivers are taken from the fish as soon as they are caught, and are\r\nheated in steam-jacketed vessels until the cell membranes burst and the\r\noil exudes. The oil is then separated by pressure.\r\n\r\nInferior qualities of oil are obtained by treating putrid livers in the\r\nsame way at the end of the voyage. These tainted liver oils are unfit\r\nfor medicinal purposes, but are used in large quantities in the leather\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nBlubber (which is from 8 to 20 ins. thick) is stripped from the whale\r\nas soon after capture as possible. Generally the dead whale is made\r\nfast alongside the whaler, a deep, spiral cut is made round its body,\r\nand the blubber is stripped off and hauled aboard. This is then cut\r\ninto pieces, chopped up in mincing machines and fed into melting\r\npans and heated with steam, often under pressure. The oil gradually\r\nexudes and collects upon the water, the cell membranes, etc.—the\r\ngreaves—settling to the bottom. At the conclusion of the boil, the oil\r\nis drawn off from above the aqueous (gluey) layer, and is clarified by\r\nstraining through sieves or filters. The “greaves” is placed in hair\r\nor woollen bags and submitted to hydraulic pressure, by which means a\r\nfurther quantity of oil is obtained.\r\n\r\nFish oils, unless specially purified for medicinal purposes, are\r\ndark-coloured liquids, with a characteristic, unpleasant, fishy smell,\r\ndue to the presence of small quantities of fishy decomposition\r\nproducts, for example trimethylamine.\r\n\r\nWhen cooled, many samples of fish oil deposit solid masses of fish\r\ntallow (fish stearine).\r\n\r\nFish oils, and, to a less extent, the marine animal oils, e.g. whale,\r\nseal, porpoise, are drying oils like linseed oil, that is they possess\r\nto a very marked degree a capacity for absorbing oxygen from the air,\r\nand so become thickened and viscous. This thickening is generally\r\ninduced by blowing air through the warm oil. Oils that have been\r\nthickened in this way are known as “blown” oils.\r\n\r\nBlown fish oils are mixed with mineral oils for use as lubricants for\r\nheavy machinery. They have been used as vehicles for paints in place\r\nof linseed oil, but with somewhat disappointing results. They are used\r\nsuccessfully in place of linseed oil in the manufacture of printers’\r\nink, and in making paints for painting smoke stacks. Such paints resist\r\nsuccessfully the action of heat and light.\r\n\r\nMore particularly, they are used in the leather industry. Fish oils are\r\nused chiefly in the manufacture of chamois leather. Ordinary chamois\r\nor wash-leather is made from the flesh-splits of sheep skins. The skin\r\nis well washed and softened, and freed from hair by treatment with\r\nlime. It is then split, and the loose and fatty middle layer removed\r\nby a sharp knife. The lime is removed by a short bran-drench and the\r\nsuperfluous moisture is pressed out. The skin is thus rendered porous\r\nand easily able to absorb the oil. It is stretched on a table and oiled\r\nwith fish or whale oil. The oiled skin is folded up and worked for two\r\nor three hours in the faller stocks and then shaken out and hung up\r\nfor a short time to cool and partially dry. The process is repeated a\r\nnumber of times, until all the water originally present in the skin\r\nhas been replaced by oil. The oiled skins are then piled in a warm\r\nplace. The oil gradually oxidizes—probably owing to some fermentation\r\nprocess—and the skins become yellow and very hot. From time to time the\r\nskins are strewn on the floor to cool and then re-piled, the process\r\nbeing repeated until the oxidation of the oil is complete. In France\r\nthe freshly-oiled skins are hung in hot stoves, and the oxidation of\r\nthe oil is completed in one operation.\r\n\r\nThe skins are then dipped in water and passed through hydraulic\r\npresses, by which the surplus oil is removed. This surplus thick,\r\noxidized oil is known as “degras” or “moellon,” and is used for\r\nstuffing leathers that have already been tanned. Stuffed leathers are\r\nsupple and impervious to water, and are used for harness, belting,\r\netc. A further quantity of oil may be removed from the “chamoised”\r\nleather by treating it with potash or carbonate of soda, “sod” oil\r\nbeing recovered from the extract by neutralization with sulphuric acid.\r\nThe value of sod oil for oiling dressed leather is due to a resinous\r\nacid of unknown composition, that is soluble in alkali but insoluble in\r\npetroleum ether.\r\n\r\nEnamel or patent leather is generally coated, after tanning, with\r\na linseed oil varnish, boiled with prussian blue, and dried in a\r\nsteam heated chest at 70° to 80°C., the process being repeated\r\nuntil a sufficiently thick coat is produced. Fish oils are now used\r\nsuccessfully in place of linseed oil. The enamel leather produced,\r\nalthough not quite so glossy as that made with linseed oil, is said to\r\nbe more pliable.\r\n\r\nFish oils are also employed in the manufacture of such closely-related,\r\nalthough happily diverse, substances as soap and margarine. All\r\nanimal and vegetable fats and oils are essentially compounds of\r\nglycerine, with one or other of three acids: palmitic, stearic and\r\noleic. Palmitic and stearic acids and their compounds are solids at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, whereas oleic acid and its compounds are\r\nliquid. This difference appears to be connected in some way with the\r\nmolecular structure of these substances. When oleic acid is heated\r\nwith hydrogen gas under pressure, in the presence of finely-divided\r\nnickel, it absorbs hydrogen and is transformed into stearic acid. Oleic\r\nacid, therefore, is said to be unsaturated with respect to hydrogen,\r\nwhereas stearic acid is called a saturated acid. This process, whereby\r\na liquid oil is transformed into a solid fat, is called hydrogenation,\r\nor hardening.\r\n\r\nBoth the margarine industry and the soap industry require large\r\nquantities of hard fats. Originally the soap industry absorbed the\r\navailable supplies of hard animal fats such as beef suet, hog’s lard,\r\nand mutton suet. The margarine industry depended upon these same\r\nsupplies of animal fats, and the rapid growth in the production of\r\nmargarine during recent years has seriously diminished the supply of\r\nhard fats necessary for the manufacture of soap.\r\n\r\nThe hydrogenation of whale oil and various fish oils has now made\r\nit possible to supply this demand, and has also made possible the\r\nindustrial utilization of substances, such as fish oils, for which\r\nformerly comparatively little use could be found.\r\n\r\nHardened whale oil melts at 40° to 50°C., and is a white solid entirely\r\ndevoid of taste or smell. It is used for making soap, and as a lard\r\nsubstitute for cooking purposes.\r\n\r\n=Fish Glue.= Fish glue is the most important liquid glue on the market.\r\nThe bulk of the fish glue manufactured to-day is made from the waste\r\nand offal that are discarded by the curers. This waste consists of\r\nheads, bones, viscera and skins. The best glue is obtained from the\r\nskins of non-oily, demersal fish, for example cod, haddock, soles,\r\nplaice and hake.\r\n\r\nThe waste is washed in running water to free it from salt. Sometimes\r\nthe waste—particularly the heads—is decomposed with hydrochloric\r\nacid and afterwards neutralized with lime. It is then charged into a\r\ncooker provided with a perforated, false bottom. The stock is covered\r\nwith water and heated with steam. The glue is extracted and gradually\r\nconcentrates in the water. When this glue liquor is sufficiently\r\nconcentrated (from 5 to 6 per cent), it is run off (the first run) and\r\nmore water is added to the waste and the cooking continued. After about\r\n10 hours cooking, nearly all the glue has been extracted and the liquor\r\nis again run off (the second run). The cooked waste is then withdrawn,\r\nand any remaining glue liquor is pressed out of it and added to the\r\nsecond run. From 2 to 4 per cent of phenol or boric acid are added to\r\nprevent decomposition by bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe glue liquor is evaporated down to a concentration of 32 per cent in\r\nopen vats or closed evaporators, and is bleached with sulphurous acid.\r\nA small amount of some essential oil, e.g. cassia, clove, wintergreen,\r\nis added to check mould growth and mask the fishy odour. Glue is also\r\nmade in a similar way from the “greaves” obtained from whale blubber.\r\n\r\nFish glue is manufactured in three grades.\r\n\r\nGRADE I is made from skins, only the first run being used. It is used\r\nfor photo-engraving work, for the production of half-tone plates.\r\n\r\nGRADE II is made from second run skin liquors and fish waste. It is\r\nsold in small cans and bottles for general repair work.\r\n\r\nGRADE III is prepared from fish heads, and is sold in large cans and\r\nbarrels for sizing, box making, cabinet making, and general joiner\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe glue is sometimes made more flexible by the addition of glycerine\r\nand glucose. The flexibility of fish glue makes it useful for the\r\nmanufacture of court plaster, labels, stamps, and in book-binding.\r\n\r\nThe residue from the press is dried and sold as chicken feed or\r\nfertilizer. For the latter purpose it is frequently mixed with\r\nCarnallite.\r\n\r\n=Fish Gelatine.= Fish gelatine or isinglass is obtained from the\r\nswimming bladder of the sturgeon and also of the cod. The bladders are\r\nexported, either opened (pipe isinglass) or washed, split open and\r\ndried (purse, lump or leaf isinglass).\r\n\r\nIsinglass is the purified and dried inner skin of the bladder. It has\r\nbut feeble adhesive power. It is used for clarifying wines, ciders and\r\nbeers, and for making jellies and plasters.\r\n\r\n=Fertilizers.= In many places near the sea, fish are employed whole as\r\nmanure. Sprats particularly are caught in large numbers and distributed\r\nover the fields, and left to decompose. Fresh sprats contain 63·7 per\r\ncent of water, 1·94 per cent nitrogen, 2·1 per cent ash (0·43 potash\r\nand 0·90 phosphoric acid).\r\n\r\nFish guano or fish manure is generally prepared from the fish waste\r\ndiscarded by the curer. An average sample of this manufactured fish\r\nmanure will contain 12 per cent water, 60 per cent organic matter,\r\nyielding 10 per cent ammonia, 16 per cent of calcium phosphate, and a\r\nresidue of salt, sand, magnesia and potash, the amount of potash being\r\ninconsiderable. Fish guano is mainly valuable as a source of ammonia,\r\nthe ammonia content ranging from 6 to 11 per cent, according to the\r\nkind of fish used and its previous history, e.g. whether fresh or\r\nsalted.\r\n\r\nIn many places, such as London, the fish offal from the shops and\r\nrestaurants is collected, dried and ground up for use as manure.\r\nIn Germany in 1918 herrings’ heads were removed by the curers to be\r\nutilized for the production of oil, albumen, and phosphate of lime.\r\nThe herring meal contained up to 50 per cent of albumen and calcium\r\nphosphate, the latter being obtained from the bones and heads. The\r\nalbumen was extracted chemically and prepared for human consumption.\r\nThe oil was extracted with benzol or other solvents, and, after\r\nhardening, was used in the manufacture of butter substitutes. Fish\r\nwaste or offal is fed into a continuous cooker. This cooker consists\r\nessentially of a long, cylindrical vessel, through which runs a hollow\r\nsteel shaft on which are mounted perforated radial vanes in such a way\r\nthat the whole arrangement forms a spiral conveyor. By means of the\r\nhollow shaft and vanes, steam is blown into the mass of fish waste as\r\nit travels slowly through the vessel, so that it is completely cooked\r\nand disintegrated by the time that it emerges at the other end.\r\n\r\nThe cooked mass is then fed into a press in which a screw conveyor\r\nurges it through a gradually tapering cylinder with perforated sides.\r\nIn this way the oil is extracted from it, and it is then dried and\r\ndisintegrated by a rotary drier.\r\n\r\nThere is always a little residual oil in fish manure that tends to\r\ndelay its decomposition in the soil. It is important, therefore, that\r\nthe oil be removed as completely as possible.\r\n\r\nDry fish manure requires careful storing, as the presence of this small\r\namount of oxidizable oil tends to promote spontaneous combustion.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its value as a fertilizer, the high content of protein\r\n(albumen)—namely, 50 per cent—makes fish meal a suitable food for\r\nlive-stock and poultry.\r\n\r\nThe commercial importance of this industry will be realized when we\r\nremember that practically half of the total catch of fish in the world\r\nis discarded by the curers as waste.\r\n\r\n=Fish Leather.= The hides of such marine mammals as the walrus and the\r\nseal have long formed the basis of a regular tanning industry.\r\n\r\nOf recent years, however, particularly in America, successful attempts\r\nhave been made to tan the skins of certain fish, notably the shark. The\r\nskins are treated with alkali to remove fat and oil, the alkali is then\r\nneutralized with acid, after which the skins are washed and tanned. The\r\nleather is said to be soft and pliable, and well adapted for many uses.\r\n\r\nShark skins are also tanned hard, and used to print a grain on\r\nimitation pigskin.\r\n\r\nShark fishing was commenced off the American coast in October, 1918.\r\nThe fish are hunted from fast, powerful motor boats, with specially\r\nconstructed nets. A small shark 5 ft. long will yield a hide 10 sq. ft.\r\nin area.\r\n\r\nShark skin is naturally very tough and durable, and in its untanned\r\ncondition is used by jewellers as a natural emery paper for grinding\r\nand polishing metal surfaces. It is also used as an abrasive in working\r\nhard woods and ivory.\r\n\r\nA method has been devised by which a shark skin can be split into\r\nthree. The first split, after tanning, is strong and thick, and\r\nsuitable for high grade, heavy shoes. The second furnishes leather\r\nsuitable for second grade foot wear, and the third resembles suede and\r\nis used in making fancy articles. In addition to the shark’s skin,\r\nthe fins, blood, teeth, flesh, and oil of the fish are also utilized\r\ncommercially and yield a satisfactory profit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n
