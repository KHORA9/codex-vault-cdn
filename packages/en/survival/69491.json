JUNE, 1901       No. 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STUDY IN VARIATION ON THE WING OF THE HONEY BEE.\r\n\r\nF. L. LANDACRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile working on the Honey Bee in the laboratory at the University it\r\nwas observed that the number of hooks connecting the posterior wing\r\nwith the anterior was not constant.\r\n\r\nThe query at once arose as to the amount of variation there might be\r\nbetween different bees in the same hive and also between different\r\nhives. Out of this grew a somewhat practical problem as to whether\r\nthe increase in number of hooks was associated with a decrease in the\r\nsize of the wing, or whether the increase in number of hooks also\r\nimplied an increase in size of wing.\r\n\r\nThe wings of the bee are undoubtedly more efficient for being\r\nclosely attached to each other. The life of the workers is so short,\r\nbeing only about three weeks, and their activity so great that any\r\nincrease in efficiency, especially in the organs of flight, must\r\nhave a very direct influence on the welfare of the whole swarm. So\r\nfar as the well being of the swarm depends upon nutritive processes\r\nthe efficiency of the hive is equal to the average efficiency of the\r\nworkers. Now, if the increase in number of hooks and the consequent,\r\nfirmer attachment of the wings is compensated for by a smaller wing,\r\nthere is much less opportunity for the operation of natural selection\r\non the individual bees than if the greater number of hooks is always\r\nassociated with a broader or longer wing.\r\n\r\nThis selective process might occur either in the hive or between\r\nhives. If it occurs in the hive it would increase the efficiency of\r\nthe hive somewhat; but if it occurs between hives it finally means\r\nthe elimination of the weaker hive and the consequent increased\r\nefficiency of the species.\r\n\r\nIn order to find out the real conditions, one of the students, Mr.\r\nJ. N. Frank, took twenty-five workers from each of four hives and\r\ncounted the number of hooks on each wing, right and left, and also\r\nmeasured the width of the anterior and posterior wings on each side,\r\nThe width only was taken on account of the difficulty in finding a\r\ngood point at the base of the wing from which to measure the length.\r\nThe results are so uniform that the width probably gives sufficient\r\ndata from which to draw conclusions.\r\n\r\nOf the four hives studied, numbers one and two were very weak. Number\r\nthree was a strong hive which made forty (40) pounds of extra honey\r\nin the summer of 1900. Number four was weaker than number three and\r\nmade only ten (10) pounds of extra honey.\r\n\r\nThe complete measurements are too long to give in detail, and the\r\naverages only will be offered here.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGES OF TWENTY-FIVE MEASUREMENTS FOR EACH HIVE TAKEN WITH AN\r\nEYE-PIECE MICROMETER, EXPRESSED IN MM.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIVE NUMBER ONE.\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+-----------------------\r\n  Average Number of Hooks.| Average Width of Wing.\r\n  -----------+------------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Right wing.| Left wing. |Right wing.| Left wing.\r\n             |            | Ant.

The\r\nright wing is taken as the standard, and the most active hive, No.\r\n3. shows the greatest individual variation. One bee in this hive\r\nhad only sixteen hooks, the remaining three being straight spines,\r\nshowing how the hooks have been modified from ordinary hairs. This\r\nreversion occurred on three separate wings, in No. 2 one hook on each\r\nwing being straight.\r\n\r\nAs to the relation between the number of hooks and the width of the\r\nwing the averages are very definite. Taking hives number one and two\r\nfrom the same apiary, it will be seen that the increase in number of\r\nhooks goes with the increase in width of wing. The same relation is\r\nshown by hives numbers three and four from another apiary in the case\r\nof the posterior portion of the right wing and in both anterior and\r\nposterior portions of left wing.\r\n\r\nThe results are not conclusive as to the relative efficiency of\r\ndifferent hives because there are so many conditions entering into\r\nthe production of large quantities of honey. The number of bees, the\r\ncare during the winter, the age of the queen, the number of swarms\r\nproduced, and several other factors would have to be taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the right and left wings in the bees of the same\r\nhive is marked. The right wing has the larger number of hooks, but\r\nthe left wing is the broader. In hive number one the average number\r\nof hooks in the right wing is 21.3, left 20.9; but the anterior wing\r\non the right side is 4.21 mm., while the left anterior wing is 4.28;\r\nthat is, there is a compensation for the reduced number of hooks in\r\nthe increased width of the wing. This is true of the first three\r\nhives. In the fourth hive there is a slight advantage in favor of the\r\nright wing.\r\n\r\nThe following general conclusions may be drawn from these\r\nmeasurements:\r\n\r\n(_a_) There is a variation in the number of hooks in a given hive\r\nranging between 17 and 23.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The difference in the number of hooks in the right and left\r\nwing is compensated for in a given hive by the increased size of the\r\nwing. The right and left wings are in physiological equilibrium.\r\n\r\n(_c_) In different hives the increase in the number of hooks is\r\naccompanied by an increase in width of wing; that is, the variation\r\nis emphasized so that selection would work much more effectively;\r\nwhile in the individual, where—if selection operated on account of\r\nthis variation—it would have to be between different wings of the\r\nsame bee, the variation is eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWELVE PLANTS ADDITIONAL TO THE OHIO LIST.\r\n\r\nW.

BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larvae of all the American species of the Family Cercopidae\r\nas far as known envelope themselves in a frothy mass. Contrary to\r\npopular opinion and to most of the published accounts this froth\r\ndoes not issue as bubbles from the body of the insect, but is made\r\nby pushing the tip of the abdomen up out of the froth and grasping,\r\nwith the anal appendages, a bubble of air and bringing it down and\r\nreleasing it within a liquid film. This liquid film is simply the\r\nexcretion from the alimentary canal of the sap which is imbibed by\r\nthese insects in large quantities. This copious liquid excretion is\r\na common occurrence in other families of the Homoptera. In the Plant\r\nLice (Aphidae) it gathers in drops and is called “Honey Dew.” The\r\nLeaf Hoppers and Tree Hoppers expel a clear liquid with some force.\r\nIn some species this is in sufficient amount so that when the insects\r\nare numerous the foliage may drip, producing the “Weeping trees” of\r\nthe Southern States.\r\n\r\nThis process of froth making in the Cercopidae was discovered and\r\nfirst correctly described by Professor E. S. Morse, of Salem, Mass.,\r\nand published many years ago in his Elementary Zoology.[1] His\r\nobservations were probably made on the larvae of _A. spumarius_ which\r\nbelongs to the genus _Philaenus_ as now recognized.\r\n\r\nIn the genus _Aphrophora_ as now limited little is known of the food\r\nhabits of the larvae. One species (_A._ 4-_notata_) has been found\r\non various plants and shrubs. The remaining three eastern species,\r\nwhich belong to a different group and are of some shade of brownish\r\ntestaceous, have been given as feeding on pines in the adult state\r\nby various authors. Dr. Fitch has described the larvae of one of\r\nthese (_A. parallela_, Fig. 4, Plate 10) as forming frothy masses\r\non the tips of pine twigs, and in the Nat’l Museum Coll. are some\r\n_Aphrophora_ larvae labeled “Pa. On Pine, July 7,” that undoubtedly\r\nbelong to this species leaving little room to doubt the correctness\r\nof Fitch’s determination.\r\n\r\nThere are two species belonging to the _parallela_ group occurring in\r\nthe Rocky Mountain region both found in the adult stage on pines. Of\r\none of these (_A. permutata_, Fig. 1, 2 and 3, Plate 10) larvae were\r\nfound in abundance on two different plants _Chrysopsis villosa_ and\r\n_Lupinus sp._ Both of these plants grow in clumps and it was always\r\ndown in the bases of these clumps, some of them often down below the\r\nsurface of the ground among the roots, that the larvae were found.\r\nOften ten or fifteen would be found in a single clump their united\r\nfroth masses, held up by the coarse stems, reaching a diameter of two\r\ninches or more.\r\n\r\nThe larvae were found in these clumps from late in May until the\r\nfirst week in July in the foot hills, and higher up in the mountains\r\nthey were just beginning to emerge July 20th. When ready to emerge\r\nthey climb up a stem during the night far enough to free themselves\r\nfrom the froth and as soon as the sun strikes then in the morning\r\nthey burst their pupal skins and an hour later they are ready to fly\r\nup to the pine trees where their color admirably protects them.\r\n\r\nAlthough both these plants grow very commonly over a wide extent\r\nof territory the _Aphrophora_ larvae have never been found on them\r\nexcept where they were within a short distance of a pine tree. At\r\nfirst sight it would seem probable that the eggs were deposited\r\nin the twigs of the pines, and that the young larvae dropped to\r\nthe ground, and from there sought out a food plant, as is the case\r\nin some Cicadas. But as numerous larvae were found in positions\r\npractically inaccessible to any such means of distribution—such as\r\non the opposite side of a sharp ledge of rocks, across a bramble\r\nthicket, or even on plants growing in the crevices of bare rocks at\r\na considerable distance above any pines—it seemed nearly certain that\r\nthe adults must fly back to the plants to deposit their eggs.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to discover whether a similar food habit\r\noccurs in any of the Eastern members of the genus or whether this\r\nis peculiar to the western species. It seems possible that original\r\npine-inhabiting species finding themselves unable to maintain their\r\nfroth masses in their exposed positions on pine branches in such a\r\ndry atmosphere were compelled to seek moister conditions such as are\r\nafforded by the shade and contact with the earth under these bushy\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n EXPLANATION OF PLATE.—Fig. 1. _Aphrophora permutata_ Uhl.

GRIGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of the manuals are entirely silent regarding the vernation of\r\nthe Willows. Sargent[2] describes their leaves as “variously folded\r\nin the bud” and under different species gives them as: involute,\r\nrevolute, convolute, and even conduplicate in the bud. The fact that\r\nhe gives two species, closely related and difficult to distinguish,\r\nat the time the buds open (Salix nigra and S. amygdaloides), as\r\nhaving involute and revolute vernations, led me to take up the matter\r\nto see if a key for their identification from bud characters, could\r\nbe constructed.\r\n\r\nNot only did I find that they were not involute and revolute\r\nrespectively; but that they were neither involute nor revolute,\r\nbut both imbricate. On examining other species the same thing was\r\nfound. The only exceptions to the true imbricate vernation found are\r\nrepresented in figures 3 and 4. The section Purpureae, on account of\r\nits tendency to have opposite rather than alternate leaves, often\r\nforms such decussate buds as are shown in figure 3. In Salix incana\r\nSchrenk, a species whose leaves at maturity have revolute margins,\r\nthe leaves have a greater or less tendency to roll backwards in the\r\nbud. The most extreme case found is shown in figure 4. Others from\r\nthe same twig could be shown where the leaves show only the slightest\r\ntendency to be revolute. If we may consider that this backward\r\nturning is merely a character of the mature leaf manifesting itself\r\nin the bud it is evident that there is here no revolute vernation but\r\nthat it is really imbricate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Salix buds]\r\n\r\nThe other buds examined vary from the form represented in figure 1\r\nwhere the whole interior of the bud is taken up with the closely\r\npacked leaves, to that shown in figure 2 where there are a few leaves\r\nwith a great deal of wool.\r\n\r\nSpecies like Salix fragilis L. whose leaves are glabrous when they\r\nunfold have buds like the former while species like Salix discolor\r\nMuhl., with leaves excessively wooly when they unfold, are like the\r\nlatter. As there are all intergradations between these two kinds of\r\nleaves, there is naturally a series of buds between these two as\r\nextremes. While further investigation is necessary before we would\r\nbe warranted in declaring that the vernation of the whole genus is\r\nimbricate; yet the fact that specimens of thirty-four species and\r\nvarieties, taken from thirteen of the nineteen sections given by\r\nAndersson in DeCandolle’s prodromus, have their leaves imbricated in\r\nthe buds would seem to establish a presumption in favor of such a\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe buds examined were soaked in 70% alcohol and free-hand sections\r\ncut and mounted in balsam. On account of scarcity of material,\r\nthe buds of several species were not sectioned but dissected on\r\nthe growing plant. Such are marked with an asterisk (*). As far\r\nas possible living material was taken, mostly from native plants.\r\nThose species not native were studied from specimens growing in\r\nthe University Botanic Garden. In a few cases dried specimens were\r\nresorted to. About one hundred and twenty-five plants belonging to\r\nthe following species and varieties were examined.\r\n\r\n   Salix nigra Marsh.\r\n   S. amygdaloides Anders.\r\n   S. triandra L.\r\n  *S. undulata Ehrh.\r\n   S. lucida Muhl.\r\n   S. pentandra L.\r\n   S. fragilis L.\r\n   S. alba L.\r\n   S. alba vitellina (L.)

As I had one made to order and\r\nknow by experience the valuable service it did me, I do not hesitate\r\nto recommend it highly. It is well known that many druggists buy\r\ntheir glycerine and castor oil in five gallon cans, for which, when\r\nempty, they have no further use. The botanist, therefore, may go to\r\nsuch a druggist, procure two of the above cans, if possible of heavy\r\ntin and with flat sides, have the tinsmith take off their upper parts\r\nand solder the cans together, after having cut out of each of them a\r\nrectangular piece as long and wide as necessary to give room for a\r\ndoor and after having trimmed any inside edges. The door is then made\r\nfrom the two pieces cut out, (or from a new piece) with the addition\r\nof several strips of tin, so that it may overlap and close tightly,\r\nand of the necessary hinges and hasp to open and fasten the door. One\r\nof the original wire handles of the cans is fastened in a similar\r\nmanner as before on the top of the box and the preserving box is\r\nready for use, as soon as it had received two coatings of asphaltum\r\nvarnish inside and two of paint outside. Any vessel of suitable\r\nsize and containing water should then be put into the box, which will\r\nfurnish the moisture for the roots or the lower ends of the plants\r\nand at the same time for the air surrounding these. The dimensions\r\nof the box in question can easily be determined by the botanist\r\nhimself, but for those not wishing to do so, I may be allowed to\r\nadd, that the length of the box should be about twenty-five inches,\r\nthe original width of the cans remaining unchanged. The door should\r\ncommence at about three inches from the bottom, reach up to two or\r\ntwo and one-half inches from the top and have a width of six or six\r\nand one-half inches.\r\n\r\n_Cleveland, Ohio._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOHIO TUMBLEWEEDS.\r\n\r\nJOHN H. SCHAFFNER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTumbleweeds are characteristic of wind-swept plains and dry prairies.\r\nAs the forests are rapidly disappearing, the conditions in Ohio are\r\nbecoming very favorable for the introduction and development of such\r\nforms of vegetation. A few species are already abundant and some\r\nlike Amaranthus graecizans appear to flourish better than on the\r\nprairies of the interior. The past summer a number of cornfields\r\nabout Columbus were covered with very large tumbleweeds and during\r\nthe winter a number of hedgerows were filled with them, presenting an\r\nappearance quite as striking as anything the writer has seen along\r\nthis line.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the Ohio plants which may develop as\r\ntumbleweeds. Those with a question mark have not been seen by the\r\nwriter to act as tumbleweeds and a few are given on the authority of\r\nDr. W. J. Beal.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUAL TUMBLEWEEDS.\r\n\r\n  1.

He gave the more important conclusions he had arrived at,\r\nafter an extended study of the muscular and skeletal systems of that\r\nbeetle.\r\n\r\nMr. Griggs read a paper on Vernation in the Willows.\r\n\r\nMoulds and other Fungi Injurious to Foods was the title of a paper\r\ngiven by Miss Mary Dresbach. She gave a list of fungi found on food\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this paper Professor Schaffner said the moulds are of\r\npublic interest and many important results may be expected from an\r\nextended study of them. Professor Kellerman said that moulds are an\r\nimportant factor to guard against in canning fruit. It would be a\r\ngreat step in advance if fruit could be canned and kept without its\r\nbeing cooked beforehand.\r\n\r\nMiss Elma Perry gave a list of the edible fungi of Ohio. So far 200\r\nspecies have been recorded and there are no doubt many yet to add.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of personal observations Prof. Kellerman showed some\r\ninteresting variations in our common anemone. A paper on this subject\r\nappeared in the May number of THE OHIO NATURALIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE MEETING.\r\n\r\nThe June meeting of the club was held in Zoological Lecture Room on\r\nthe evening of the third.\r\n\r\nThe editor-in-chief of THE OHIO NATURALIST, Professor Schaffner, gave\r\na financial statement for the year.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary read a communication from Professor Kellerman. This\r\ncommunication was concerned with the past and future of THE OHIO\r\nNATURALIST and an adjourned meeting was voted for its consideration.\r\nThe following invitation was received from Professor W. D. Gibbs,\r\nSecretary of the Omega Chapter of the Society of Sigma Xi:\r\n\r\nThe Omega Chapter of the Society of Sigma Xi cordially invites the\r\nmembers of the Biological Club to be present at the final meeting of\r\nthe Chapter, in the Physical Lecture Room, Saturday June 8th, at 11\r\no’clock a. m. to hear a lecture by Professor Charles F. Mabery on\r\nthe subject: “The Petroleum Industry: Its Rapid Expansion and Future\r\nPromise.”\r\n\r\nDr. Bownocker delivered an instructive paper on “Oil and Gas in\r\nSoutheastern Ohio.” The first oil well in that region was drilled\r\nabout 1860 at Maxburg in Washington County. The wells in this region\r\nwhen first put down oftentimes yield 500 barrels or more daily but\r\nthey soon decrease until the product of the same well may be only a\r\nfew barrels each day. They are long-lived however and wells drilled\r\nin the Sixties are still producing. The oil in Southeastern Ohio has\r\nits origin in the various sands and therefore differs from that of\r\nNorthwestern Ohio where all the oil is of limestone origin.\r\n\r\nThe speaker explained the nature of the country, especially in\r\nreference to the arches where practically all the oil is located.\r\n\r\nH. S. Houghton not being present, Professor Landacre gave a short\r\noutline of the subject “A Study of the Muscular and Skeletal\r\nStructures in the Head of a 14 mm. Salamander.”\r\n\r\nA. F. Conradi read a short paper on the subject “A Study of the\r\nCecidomyidae and their effects upon Vegetation.”\r\n\r\nThe motion was made and carried that when we adjourn we adjourn to\r\nmeet in the Zoological Lecture Room Friday evening, June 7th, at 4\r\no’clock, for the purpose of considering matters connected with the\r\nTHE OHIO NATURALIST.\r\n\r\n  JAMES S.
