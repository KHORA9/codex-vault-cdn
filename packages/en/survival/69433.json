There\r\nare the girls coming now, down by the office. Oh! and we’re not going\r\nto have any more school this week. The teacher has got to go to the\r\ndentist every day, and she isn’t going to feel like teaching; so we are\r\ngoing to have vacation.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me,” said Marian, smiling, “what in the wide world will you\r\nchildren do, with so much spare time on your hands?”\r\n\r\n“O Marian! Marian! Can’t we--it will be just the time to do it--can’t\r\nwe go to Smugglers’ Island?” Delbert’s body fairly quivered with\r\nexcitement, and his dark eyes were shining like stars. “Let me ask Mr.\r\nCunningham for the launch. We could go to-morrow. O Marian, do, please!”\r\n\r\nMarian hesitated. “Smugglers’ Island! That is a long way off. We\r\ncouldn’t be ready by to-morrow; it is late now.”\r\n\r\n“We don’t need anything but a lunch. I don’t mean to get up a party.\r\nJust us go. We don’t need to go to a lot of fuss.”\r\n\r\nIf Marian had an especial weakness, it was her brother Delbert. She was\r\nproud of that spirited, handsome little face, and rarely clouded it by\r\na refusal if a consent was possible. Besides the sister love she gave\r\nhim in common with the other children, there was a desire to make up to\r\nhim the loss of a companion brother who had died a few years before,\r\na brother a little older than Delbert, but of much the same cast of\r\nfeatures.\r\n\r\nNow she thought, “Why not? Why think one must make elaborate\r\npreparations for every little pleasure, when the children would enjoy\r\nit as well, maybe better, without?”\r\n\r\nShe laughed. “Here come the girls,” she said. “We’ll put it to a vote.”\r\n\r\nThe little girls, Jennie and Esther, came up the path. Jennie was\r\neight, a puny, thin little shadow, with eyes that seemed much too big\r\nbecause the face was so thin and colorless. She had been born a sickly\r\nbaby and had averaged at least one illness every year of her life\r\nsince, and had never known what actual health was. When Mrs. Hadley\r\nhad decided to accompany her husband on his business trip to Guaymas\r\nshe had thought seriously of taking Jennie with her, though she had\r\nhad never a moment’s uneasiness at leaving the other three in their\r\nsister’s care. But it had seemed a pity to take the little girl out of\r\nschool, where she was doing well; and also there was a good American\r\ndoctor in town, whom Marian promised faithfully to send for at the\r\nfirst symptom of anything wrong; so, as Jennie herself did not seem to\r\ncare about going, it was finally decided she should stay.\r\n\r\nEsther, the six-year-old, stood in pleasing contrast to her sister.\r\nHaving never known sickness, she was a sturdy, robust little specimen,\r\nas plump as the baby David, dimpled and rosy, with curly hair that was\r\nforever getting into her bright eyes.\r\n\r\nDelbert was dancing with delight. “Girls, girls,” he squealed, “listen,\r\nquick. All in favor of going to Smugglers’ Island to-morrow, signify by\r\nsaying ‘Aye.’”\r\n\r\n“Aye, aye, aye!” he yelled; and Esther, taking her cue, also launched a\r\nmyriad of “ayes,” but Jennie shook her head in grave disapproval.\r\n\r\n“You are too ev’lastin’ noisy,” she said. “Marian, we are not going in\r\nthe launch, are we?”\r\n\r\nThe baby was calling “Aye” most lustily.\r\n\r\n“There,” declared Delbert, “that’s a m’jority, Marian. Three out of\r\nfive’s a m’jority.”\r\n\r\nMarian drew Jennie tenderly to her. “Delbert wants to go to Smugglers’\r\nIsland to-morrow. It is a long way, but perhaps you would not be\r\nseasick in the launch. Do you want to go?”\r\n\r\nThe little girl’s shining eyes were answer enough. Marian laughed and\r\nkissed her. “Delbert,” she said then, “take that bill that is in my\r\npurse down to Mr. Cunningham now and refund him for the duties on these\r\npackages and thank him for me,--don’t forget that,--and then see if he\r\ncan let us have the launch to-morrow. It may be let to some one else,\r\nbut if it isn’t, and if we can have it, why, pay him for that too, and\r\ndon’t forget that. But I warn you children there’s not a thing for\r\nlunch but bread and butter. I haven’t so much as a cooky in the jar,\r\nand it’s too late for me to bake now.”\r\n\r\nPreviously there had lived at the Port for some years an American boy\r\nwhose chief joy in life had been found on the water, and, having been\r\nblest with a small sailboat of his own, he had been able to indulge his\r\nsailor propensities to the utmost. Sometimes with other boys, often\r\nalone, he had sailed up and down the coast for miles, exploring the\r\nshallow bays and winding _esteros_,[1] and he knew all the sandbars and\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n  [1] An _estero_ (pronounced _es-tāʹ-ro_) is an estuary, an arm\r\n      of the sea.\r\n\r\nA few miles out from the Port was a group of islands known to the\r\nAmericans thereabouts as the Rosalie Group. The natives gave them\r\nanother name, unpronounceable, and certainly unspellable. They\r\nconsisted of quite an assortment of rocky knolls and stunted trees,\r\nand little beaches, fine for bathing. Most people confined their\r\nseaward excursions to trips of greater or less duration of time to\r\nthese islands, some half-dozen in number, but Clarence had ventured\r\nmuch farther; he had even gone as far as San Moros, many miles down the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nSan Moros was a wide-mouthed, shallow bay, full of rocks and sandbars,\r\nbut at its farther extremity the young explorer had discovered\r\nan island that gave unmistakable evidence of having once been\r\ninhabited,--probably by smugglers, as in times past they had flourished\r\nlike the bay tree all up and down the west coast, as everybody knows.\r\n\r\nBoy-like, Clarence had kept his discovery a secret, or at least had\r\nrevealed it only to a chosen few, Marian and Delbert being among the\r\nelect. And when afterwards he had made a second trip to the place, Mrs.\r\nHadley had allowed Delbert to go with him. Clarence had been fond of\r\nchildren and of Delbert in particular, and often took the little boy\r\nwith him on his all-day trips on the water. On this occasion they had\r\ncamped over and explored the Island and its surroundings.\r\n\r\nIt was long months now since Clarence’s family had moved from the Port,\r\nbut Delbert had always been anxious for a second trip to the Island in\r\nSan Moros, being eager to show it to Marian and his little sisters.\r\n\r\nBefore long Delbert came rushing back. “We can go! We can go!” he\r\ncalled. “We--where’s Marian?--oh, there you are. Mr. Cunningham says\r\nwe can have the launch. The man he usually sends with it is sick or\r\nsomething, but he got Mr. Pearson to take us instead. We can start\r\nearly in the morning. Goody! And say, Marian, can’t you fix some dough\r\nfor doughnuts and let me fry ’em for you?”\r\n\r\nMarian looked severe. “Do you remember what happened the last time I\r\nlet you fry doughnuts?” she asked.\r\n\r\nDelbert’s eyes twinkled. “Yes,” he said, “but that was learning; I\r\nwon’t do it that way now.”\r\n\r\n“Shall we trust him, Jennie?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“If you don’t, there won’t be any doughnuts to-morrow,” Delbert assured\r\nher. “Marian has not got time to make ’em.”\r\n\r\n“I guess we can this time,” decided Jennie.\r\n\r\n“Me fry doughnuts, too,” said Esther.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid me had better not,” said Marian; “but you and Jennie may\r\nroll and cut them out for Delbert. And Davie, you sit up in your high\r\nchair and watch sister stir up these doughnuts quickly, and then Davie\r\nshall make a doughnut of his very own. Delbert, put the granite-ware\r\nkettle on, and the lard is in that pail on the shelf there by you. I\r\nthink there is just enough; put it all in.”\r\n\r\nShe hurried the ingredients together, and, as soon as the dough was\r\nready for rolling out, turned it over to the apprentices and ran out of\r\nthe kitchen to the numerous other tasks that awaited her.\r\n\r\n“You haven’t read us mamma’s letter yet,” called Jennie.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I will read it while we eat supper,” Marian answered.\r\n\r\n“What mamma say?” shrilled Esther.\r\n\r\n“Says they will be back in two weeks,” came Marian’s muffled voice from\r\nthe far bedroom.\r\n\r\nPresently she came back. “Jennie,” she said, “do you know what was done\r\nwith your and Esther’s bathing-suits when you came back from bathing\r\nthe other day?”\r\n\r\nJennie looked blank, but Esther answered promptly.\r\n\r\n“Down to Bobbie’s.”\r\n\r\n“Down at Bobbie’s? Whatever did you leave them there for?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” cried Jennie, her face brightening, “I ’member now. We\r\nstopped to play and hung ’em on Bobbie’s mother’s clothesline and\r\nforgot ’em.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that’s a great way to do! Esther, you run down after them now.”\r\n\r\nEsther was kneading doughnut dough industriously. “To-morrow,” she said.\r\n\r\nMarian considered a moment, and then said: “No, you go now, it is two\r\ndays they have been there already, and they may have got into some\r\ncorner where Bobbie’s mother won’t know where they are, and we won’t\r\nhave any time to hunt for lost things in the morning. It is a long way\r\nto Smugglers’ Island, and we must get off early or we shan’t have time\r\nto explore it and get back by dark.”\r\n\r\nEsther sighed, and began to clean the dough from her little fat hands.\r\n“Tell where we going?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“No; better not.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, because if Bobbie knows we are going in the launch, he will want\r\nto go, too, and I know positively his mamma wouldn’t let him.”\r\n\r\n“Why?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you little interrogation-point!” expostulated Marian under her\r\nbreath. Aloud she answered patiently, “Because Bobbie was awfully\r\nnaughty and went in the fishing-boat without asking his mamma, and she\r\nwas so worried about him, and when he got back she told him he couldn’t\r\ngo anywhere except to school,--not anywhere, not even up here to play\r\nwith Delbert,--for two whole weeks.”\r\n\r\n“Not two weeks yet?”\r\n\r\n“No, it is not two weeks yet. Now, do go on, Esther. Just ask for the\r\nbathing-suits and don’t make Bobbie feel bad by telling him about a\r\npicnic he can’t go to.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the morning, before Marian had breakfast out of the way, Delbert\r\ncame in with a rush. “I have just seen Mr. Pearson. He is going to his\r\nbreakfast, and he says he is all ready, and he wants to know if there\r\nis anything you want him to do.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Marian; “tell him to get a demijohn of water. Mr.\r\nCunningham has a demijohn he uses for that, but Mr. Pearson may not\r\nthink of it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but there is water on the Island, plenty of it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear, but it has not been filtered, and I don’t want you\r\nchildren drinking anything and everything. Oh! and did you put plenty\r\nof water for the chickens, Delbert?--and put a big stone in the pan so\r\nthey can’t tip it over?\r\n\r\n“Bread and butter and doughnuts,” she continued, “and I must take milk\r\nfor Davie. Dear me! I haven’t enough to fill the jar either. Here,\r\nJennie, get a dime from my purse and take this pail and run down and\r\nsee if Bobbie’s mother can let me have a quart of milk. If she hasn’t\r\nit to spare, you will have to go to Doña Luisa. Delbert, find the\r\nhatchet. It will come in handy when we come to build a fire for noon.”\r\n\r\n“Haven’t you got eggs, Marian? Take some raw eggs, and we can boil\r\nthem over a fire; it’s lots of fun.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve only three, Delbert, but if you can, get some at Bobbie’s, or ask\r\nFanny’s mother if she can spare me some.”\r\n\r\n“We can get crabs and clams, you know,” said Delbert. “There’s barrels\r\nof ’em. Clarence and I had ’em. But take plenty of bread and butter,\r\nMarian. Mr. Pearson can eat a lot, I know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes. Run on now and see about the eggs, and then go down and tell Mr.\r\nPearson about the water. Let me see,” she continued,--“what else? Oh,\r\nyes, if we go bathing, I shall have to comb my hair.”\r\n\r\nShe wrapped up her comb and brush in a clean towel, and then, on second\r\nthought, tucked in a little pocket-mirror and a cake of tar soap and\r\ntwo more towels.\r\n\r\n“Marian, me got my spade and pail, but me can’t find baby’s,” called\r\nEsther.\r\n\r\n“His little pail is here,” answered Marian, “but I don’t know where his\r\nspade is. Let him take the big dig-spoon instead.” A dig-spoon, be it\r\nknown, is a spoon so old and dilapidated that mother does not mind if\r\nthe children use it to dig in the dirt with. The big dig-spoon of the\r\nHadley children was a huge iron affair about a yard in length that had\r\ndoubtless been originally intended to stir soup in a hotel kitchen.\r\n\r\nAs they started down the hill on the way to the pier, Bobbie’s mother\r\nran out to her gate. “Marian,” she called, “are you taking plenty of\r\nwraps with you? You know it gets cold toward evening.”\r\n\r\nMarian held up a couple of light shoulder shawls. “Delbert has his\r\ncoat,” she said, “and Esther and I never want anything around us\r\nanyway. There are always a couple of blankets on the launch seats.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you foolish child,” declared the lady; “you wait.” She ran back\r\ninto the house, and in a moment came back with a very large heavy\r\ncircular cape, “There, you take this,” she said. “It will cover you and\r\nEsther and the baby too. Jennie will need both those flimsy shawls. You\r\nknow it won’t do to let her get chilled.”\r\n\r\nMarian thanked her laughingly and accepted the cape.\r\n\r\nMr. Cunningham was down on the pier. He was a dapper young man,\r\npleasant and good-looking and well liked by everybody at the Port,\r\nand he held the most lucrative and responsible position of all the\r\nAmericans there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIAN LAUGHINGLY ACCEPTED THE CAPE]\r\n\r\nHe smiled as the Hadley party trailed down the hill and out on the\r\npier, the sturdy baby well in the lead.\r\n\r\n“Here comes King David and his train,” he called. “By Jove,” he\r\nadded, observing the huge dig-spoon, “he has his scepter with him\r\ntoo.--Good-morning, Miss Marian; do you mean to tell me that basket is\r\nfull of lunch?”\r\n\r\n“Not quite,” laughed Marian. “There is a hatchet and my workbag and a\r\nfew other things as well.”\r\n\r\n“Workbag!” exclaimed Delbert in disgust. “What did you bring that for?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I may hemstitch a little while you children dig in the sand. I\r\nshan’t ask you to do any sewing, Delbert.”\r\n\r\nAs the big basket was being stowed away in the launch, Mr. Cunningham\r\nsaid laughingly, “If you find you have not enough, Miss Marian, there\r\nis some canned stuff in the locker you are welcome to.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” said Marian, “I think we have plenty. I have been on trips\r\nlike this before; I know how children eat. Delbert, I forgot to put in\r\nanything to cook the eggs in. You wanted to boil them, and we haven’t a\r\nthing.”\r\n\r\n“Use Esther’s pail,” he suggested.\r\n\r\n“It leaks too badly, and baby’s pail is wooden. No, if you want those\r\neggs cooked, you will have to go back and get something.”\r\n\r\n“There will be the clams, too,” said Delbert, starting back across the\r\npier on a trot.\r\n\r\n“Oh, and, Delbert--”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“You might bring Jennie’s cape, too, while you are there; and, Delbert,\r\nDelbert! Be sure and lock the door again when you come out.”\r\n\r\n“We ought to have something to bring home clams in, too,” she said\r\nafter a moment, “but he is too far gone now to call back.”\r\n\r\n“There is a big pail here in the boat-house,” said Mr. Cunningham,\r\ngoing to get it.\r\n\r\n“I shan’t be here when you get back,” he said, coming back with the\r\npail, “but the launch can be turned over to Manuel. I am going up the\r\nriver for a couple of days. I must be getting ready now, so I will bid\r\nyou good-bye and wish you a pleasant trip.”\r\n\r\nHe shook hands with Marian, pulled Esther’s curls, smiled at Jennie,\r\nstood the baby on his head a moment, and strode off across the pier.\r\n\r\nSoon Delbert came running down the hill again, his arms full.\r\n\r\n“Morning, Mr. Faston,” he called to an old gentleman who, with a basket\r\non his arm, was starting toward the plaza for his breakfast steak.\r\n\r\n“Good-morning, Delbert. Where you all going so bright and early?”\r\n\r\n“Going to Smugglers’ Island.”\r\n\r\nDelbert ran down to the launch and scrambled in. “I brought baby’s\r\njacket, too,” he said, dumping the wraps, the granite-ware kettle, and\r\na little bright new dishpan in a heap at Marian’s feet.\r\n\r\n“I see you did, but whatever did you bring that dishpan for?”\r\n\r\n“Why, it was sitting out there on the table, so I s’posed you forgot\r\nit, and I wasn’t going to be sent back again.”\r\n\r\nMarian laughed. “I had no notion of bringing it,” she said. “Well, Mr.\r\nPearson, I guess we are all ready. You’d better start off before we\r\nthink of something else we might like to take.”\r\n\r\n“Just think, Marian,” said Delbert; “Mr. Pearson has not been outside\r\nthe harbor since he has been here.”\r\n\r\n“No? Never been to the Rosalie Group, Mr. Pearson?”\r\n\r\nPearson cleared his throat. “No; when a man is busy he don’t get much\r\ntime for picnics,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I am to show him the way,” continued Delbert, “and he is to make the\r\nlaunch go there.”\r\n\r\nIt was a lovely day. The children were fairly bubbling over with the\r\nglee of it, and Marian herself felt unusually gay and light-hearted.\r\n\r\nMr. Pearson was rather silent. He was a newcomer to the Port, and\r\nMarian had had hitherto but a bare speaking acquaintance with him. She\r\nhad an instinctive feeling, however, that he considered children as\r\nnecessary nuisances; so she tried to keep them from annoying him too\r\nmuch with their chatter. However, though he volunteered no remarks,\r\nhe answered good-naturedly what was said especially to him, followed\r\nminutely Delbert’s instructions as to their direction, and listened\r\nwith apparent interest when the little fellow told of trips taken with\r\nClarence in the sailboat.\r\n\r\nOutside the shelter of the harbor they encountered the high waves of\r\nthe Gulf, and Davie was so frightened that Marian had much ado to\r\nkeep him quiet. Jennie, too, began to feel a few qualms of her old\r\nenemy, seasickness, so that with them both Marian had little chance to\r\nexchange sociabilities with Mr. Pearson.\r\n\r\nLeaving the Rosalie Group on their right, they turned down the coast\r\nbound for San Moros.\r\n\r\nDelbert was entirely unafraid. The higher the wave the better it suited\r\nhim, and he was constantly declaring he only wished they were going to\r\nstay a week. Esther echoed him, as was her wont, and Jennie feebly put\r\nin a few remarks of the same tenor, her feeling in the matter, however,\r\nbeing born of a desire to put off the nausea-beset homeward trip rather\r\nthan to prolong the picnic joy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOLLOWED MINUTELY DELBERT’S INSTRUCTIONS AS TO THEIR\r\nDIRECTION]\r\n\r\nFinally they rounded the point and entered San Moros. Delbert\r\nremembered just how Clarence had made his way in among the many rocks\r\nand sandbars, most of which were covered at high tide. The Island lay\r\nsome miles back, a crescent in shape, high and rocky at one end and\r\nrunning out to a narrow sandy point at the other. No one approaching it\r\nwould have mistrusted it was other than the mainland, for the formation\r\nwas such as to blend it perfectly with the mainland back of it, and it\r\nshowed no sign of the strip of water between till one was close upon it.\r\n\r\n“We landed first by that point of rock,” declared Delbert, pointing,\r\n“and then afterwards we took the boat in back of the Island and tied\r\nher to the pier till we were ready to go home.”\r\n\r\n“I guess that is a good enough programme to follow now,” said Mr.\r\nPearson. “Didn’t you say this side was best for crabs? That’s a\r\nnice-looking beach along there, fine for you kids to bathe on. We will\r\ntie up to those rocks till after dinner.”\r\n\r\n“Well, all right,” agreed the boy. “There is a path up to the top of\r\nthe hill, Marian, but it doesn’t come down on this side. Clarence said\r\nthe smugglers wore it going up to peek over the hill to see if any one\r\nwas coming for ’em.”\r\n\r\nThe little point of rock on the seaward side of the Island made a very\r\ngood substitute for a pier. They landed there and were able to reach\r\nthe sand without getting their feet wet. Jennie declared she felt\r\nbetter as soon as she touched shore.\r\n\r\nDelbert was anxious to lead the expedition over to the other side of\r\nthe Island, where remained the signs of former habitation.\r\n\r\n“You can go on over now,” said Pearson good-naturedly; “I’ll unload the\r\nlaunch and take a swim, and if you say there is anything there worth\r\nlooking at I can go over afterwards.”\r\n\r\nDelbert hesitated; he was counting on expatiating on the extent and\r\nglory of the ruins and preferred a large audience.\r\n\r\n“Why, of course, Delbert,” said Marian; “Mr. Pearson can take the\r\nlaunch around after dinner. This is the best side for bathing. I am not\r\nsure,” she added, as the children started off, “but after dinner would\r\nbe soon enough for the rest of us, but--”\r\n\r\nPearson laughed and shrugged his shoulders. “There is no wait in that\r\nkid,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I see there isn’t,” said Marian, as she started after her eager\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nThe hill was decidedly rocky and steep, with a goodly strip of sandy\r\nbeach at its base. The crabs scurried away as the children ran across\r\nthis.\r\n\r\n“See, Marian!” called Delbert; “see all those crabs? We’ll have them\r\nfor dinner. Don’t they look fat?”\r\n\r\n“Fat and luscious,” laughed Marian. “You are fat and luscious, too,\r\nbaby darling,” she continued, catching Davie as he stumbled over a\r\nstone, “but those qualities alone will never make a mountaineer of you.”\r\n\r\nDelbert forged ahead, scrambling over rocks and skirting thorny bushes,\r\nand the others followed as best they could.\r\n\r\n“I suppose when you get there you will stop and wait for us,” called\r\nMarian.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes,” he answered; but he did not take the hint and slacken his\r\npace then.\r\n\r\nHis bump of locality was good, and although it was almost a year since\r\nhe had been there, he made his way directly to the spot on the apex of\r\nthe hill where a faint path led down on the other side. Here he paused,\r\nand, letting out a series of triumphant whoops, announced his arrival\r\nto his upward-toiling sisters.\r\n\r\nOne by one they joined him where he sat on a big gray rock, swinging\r\nhis lariat, his most treasured possession, a new hair rope given him by\r\nan old Mexican a few weeks before.\r\n\r\n“Dear me,” said Marian, all out of breath, as she set down the baby,\r\nwhom she had been carrying the last part of the way; “whatever did you\r\nexpect to lasso here, Delbert? Crabs?”\r\n\r\n“No,” he replied, “burros! Didn’t you know there were burros here?\r\nThere’s a herd of ’em. Clarence said probably the smugglers had to\r\nleave in a hurry and couldn’t stop to round up everything they had.\r\nAnyway, there’s burros here. Yes, and pigs, too. We saw their tracks;\r\nwe didn’t see them, but Clarence said when he was here the first time\r\nhe heard ’em grunting in the bushes.”\r\n\r\nMarian was examining the surroundings. “I believe Clarence was right,”\r\nshe said. “That is a real path certainly, but there is not a sign of it\r\non the seaward side of the hill. Whoever lived down there used to come\r\nup here to this rock. You can see away out into the gulf from here,\r\never so many miles, but it is so bushy that no one here would ever be\r\nseen.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” assented Delbert; “Clarence called this Lookout Rock. Farther\r\nback this hill spreads out into a _mesa_.[2] It’s several miles long.\r\nClarence said there were deer here, too; he saw ’em.”\r\n\r\n  [2] Pronounced _mā-sȧ_; a small tableland.\r\n\r\n“An’ wil’ cats?” queried Esther.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Delbert. “I remember when we camped here it was awful quiet\r\nat night, and I asked Clarence if he s’posed there were any panthers\r\nhere, and he said no, he hadn’t seen a sign of any such thing here, and\r\nhe guessed if there ever had been, the smugglers had killed them all\r\noff.”\r\n\r\n“That is not unlikely,” said Marian; “but the burros and pigs must have\r\ncome from what they had; perhaps the deer, too,--they might have had\r\nsome for pets. But, come, if we have our breath now, children, we’d\r\nbetter go down; for see, Mr. Pearson has the launch unloaded already,\r\nand there is dinner to get when we get back.”\r\n\r\nSo they followed the twisting trail downward. It was very faint, in\r\nsome places entirely obliterated, yet taken as a whole was distinct.\r\n\r\nBetween the Island and the mainland lay a strait that was deep enough\r\nfor even large steamers, though there was little of San Moros that\r\na big steamer could have ridden safely over. A little rough rock\r\npier had been built here. “And Clarence said the fellow that built it\r\nunderstood his business, too,” declared Delbert, emphatically. “He said\r\nit was a good job; but come and look at the bananas,” he continued,\r\nleading the way.\r\n\r\nThe Island, which elsewhere presented such rough, not to say\r\nprecipitous, sides, here was level or nearly so. A house had once stood\r\nthere. The mound of its ruins was unmistakable. In one place a forked\r\ntimber stuck up; on one side was a pile of other timbers overgrown with\r\nweeds and shrubbery. There was a spring, too, that had had some sort of\r\nmasonry cover, broken now, but with a tiny pool of water at the bottom\r\nof the rocks. There were the remains of an old stone wall that had once\r\nsurrounded a garden, of which only a thick, matted banana-patch was\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nA banana plant grows to maturity, produces one bunch of bananas, and\r\nthen dies. During the time it is doing this a number of young plants\r\nspring up about the parent stalk, and each of these produces its one\r\nbunch of fruit and group of little ones, which in turn go through the\r\nsame process. It will be readily seen, therefore, that, with no one\r\nto trim out the old stalks and superfluous young ones, a banana-patch\r\nwould in the course of time become a very crowded place, indeed.\r\n\r\nThis was just what had happened to the Smugglers’ Island patch. How\r\nlong it had been left uncared-for no one could tell, but it was now an\r\nimpenetrable jungle.\r\n\r\nMarian and the children walked all round it, looking for bananas, but\r\nexcept for several bunches from which the birds had eaten the fruit,\r\nleaving the blackened skins dangling, they saw only one, and that was\r\ntoo high up for them to reach. It did not look very tempting, anyway.\r\nA little beyond were a few fan palms, but this kind of palm bears no\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nMarian sat near the site of the old house, while the children rummaged\r\nabout and explored. This was certainly an ideal place in which to\r\nhide from the world, a sunny little spot, sheltered and secluded, for\r\nthe hill hid the place from the seaward view, and across the narrow\r\nstrait lay only the rocky, thorny tangle of the uninhabited hill of the\r\nmainland, with not even an Indian ranch for miles and miles, Clarence\r\nhad said. Marian wondered what chance or incident had caused the\r\nabandonment of the place.\r\n\r\nPresently she rose.\r\n\r\n“Come, children,” she called, “we were going to catch crabs for dinner,\r\nyou know. We must be going back.”\r\n\r\nSo they went back up the dim little path to Lookout Rock and began to\r\npick their way down from there as best they could.\r\n\r\n“Why, Marian,” called Delbert, “Mr. Pearson has moved the launch. It is\r\nnot by the rocks now. Where’s he gone?”\r\n\r\nMarian glanced up.\r\n\r\n“I guess he thought we were pretty long in coming and has gone\r\nexploring on his own hook,” she said.\r\n\r\n“I’ll see,” said Delbert, and he went out to where he could see the\r\nwater all around the end of the Island and in to the little pier.\r\n\r\n“No,” he said, as he came back, “he has not gone round there.”\r\n\r\nThey went on down the hill.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why he should move it,” persisted Delbert. “That is the\r\nbest place for it on this side of the Island, and this is the best\r\nbeach for bathing.”\r\n\r\nThey went over to where the things were piled up. Pearson had dumped\r\nthem all together and thrown one of the launch blankets over them; and\r\non top of this a note was pinned with two wooden splinters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIAN TOOK IT OFF AND READ IT, AND THEN STOOD LOOKING\r\nAT IT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS]\r\n\r\nMarian took it off and read it, and then stood looking at it for\r\nseveral seconds.\r\n\r\n“Delbert,” she said quietly, “did you know of any trouble between Mr.\r\nPearson and Mr. Cunningham?”\r\n\r\n“Trouble?” repeated the boy, startled,--“trouble? Why--why,\r\nno,--not--not trouble. Why?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” said Marian, still quietly, “Mr. Pearson has stolen the\r\nlaunch and gone away and left us here.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nFOR SHELTER IN A STORM\r\n\r\n\r\nDelbert stared with wide eyes for a moment; then he snatched the note\r\nfrom Marian’s hand to read for himself. He was not much accustomed\r\nto reading writing, but this was very plainly written with a purple\r\nindelible pencil on a leaf torn from a pocket memorandum-book.\r\n\r\n  _Miss Marian_,--\r\n\r\n  _Boss Cunningham has done me plenty of dirt and now he is going\r\n  to regret it just one gasolene launch. Sorry to inconvenience a\r\n  lady and all that, but the kids want to stay overnight anyway_.\r\n\r\nDelbert looked up again into his sister’s face; then, dropping the\r\nnote, he sped across the sand and up the hillside to where he could get\r\na good view of the Gulf beyond the bay.\r\n\r\nMarian picked up the note, and still stood looking at it.\r\n\r\n“How we get home?” inquired Esther.\r\n\r\nThat was precisely the question that was racing round in Marian’s\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n“I don’t know--yet,” she said.\r\n\r\nSlowly she took off the blanket that was thrown over the things.\r\nThe other blanket was there, too, and all of their things, also the\r\nfive-gallon demijohn of filtered water and a tin box of crackers,\r\nnearly full, three cans of corn, and a quart can of tomatoes. She\r\nremembered Mr. Cunningham had said there were some eatables in the\r\nlocker.\r\n\r\nA big crab came slowly up and regarded them. Marian returned his look\r\ngravely. “Yes,” she said, “I see you are there, and we may thank our\r\nstars you _are_ there, too, you and your relations.”\r\n\r\n“W-won’t Mr. Pearson come back?” faltered Jennie.\r\n\r\n“I am afraid not,” answered Marian.\r\n\r\n“But--but what shall we do?”\r\n\r\nMarian reached down into her boots, where her heart had sunk, and\r\npulled up a smile by main force and put it on her lips. A connoisseur\r\nin smiles would have known at a glance that it never grew there of its\r\nown accord, but Jennie was only eight and was not versed in artificial\r\nsmiles.\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear,” said the big sister, “we can’t walk back and we can’t\r\nswim back, so I guess we shall just have to Robinson Crusoe it here\r\ntill some one comes after us. When they find we don’t come home, they\r\nwill hunt for us, of course. See here,” she added, briskly, pulling out\r\nthe big pail Mr. Cunningham had lent them for clams, “you children take\r\nthis pail and get some crabs. I will build a fire, and we will have\r\ndinner right away before anything else awful happens to us.”\r\n\r\nThe children, reassured by her tone and smile, took the pail and\r\ntrotted off down the beach. They had caught crabs on the little beaches\r\nof the Rosalies and understood the business. Even Davie got a stick and\r\nlanded a few.\r\n\r\nMarian gathered some sticks and built a fire in the shade of a big\r\nrock. She had it well started when Delbert came back to her.\r\n\r\n“I can see something black away out in the Gulf; probably it is him,”\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\n“Probably,” she answered.\r\n\r\nThey brought the things up to the fire and began to unpack the basket.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see why he did it!” finally burst forth Delbert with clouded\r\nface and quivering lips.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Marian quietly, “he evidently was a different kind of man\r\nfrom what we supposed. There are a few such people in the world.”\r\n\r\n“But, Marian, no one knows where we are. They wouldn’t know where to\r\nlook for us if they were hunting for us.”\r\n\r\n“No, but I have been thinking, probably Mr. Pearson doesn’t know that.\r\nWhat did you say to him last night?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing. Mr. Cunningham did the talking. He just called and asked him\r\nif he could go out with a party in the launch to-day, and he said yes\r\nand came over and asked who was going, and when Mr. Cunningham told\r\nhim, he asked what time we should want him. It was this morning he\r\nasked me if I knew the way, because he had never been out to any of the\r\nislands, he said.”\r\n\r\n“Did you tell Mr. Cunningham where we were going?”\r\n\r\nDelbert thought a moment. “No; I just asked could we have the launch\r\nfor all day.”\r\n\r\n“And you didn’t tell Bobbie or any of the other children?”\r\n\r\n“No; I didn’t see any of them last night, and not to talk to this\r\nmorning. When I went for the milk, I just said we were going in the\r\nlaunch. But Bobbie’s mother knew we were going; she brought out the\r\ncape to you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but she didn’t know where. I never thought to mention it to any\r\none. When you came back with Jennie’s cape, you told Mr. Faston we were\r\ngoing to Smugglers’ Island, but unless some of them remember hearing\r\nClarence tell of it they won’t know where Smugglers’ Island is.”\r\n\r\nDelbert shook his head. “Clarence didn’t tell about it to any one but\r\nhis folks and us. We had it for a secret. Why, Marian, they won’t know\r\nat all where to look for us!”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Marian steadily; “it was an awfully mean trick for\r\nMr. Pearson to serve us, even without counting the stealing of the\r\nlaunch, but you see, Delbert, Mr. Pearson supposes every one knows\r\nwhere Smugglers’ Island is. He heard what you said to Mr. Faston, and,\r\nbesides that, I’ve been thinking, and there was not a single thing\r\nsaid on the way out this morning that would have led him to suppose we\r\nwere the only ones that knew about the place. We talked about my never\r\nhaving been here before, but not a word but what other people knew. He\r\nsupposes of course everybody knows, and that when we do not come home\r\nto-night they will come straight here in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“But they won’t,” said the boy. “When we don’t come home they will\r\nthink we are camping over. They won’t know till Mr. Cunningham gets\r\nback that we were coming home to-night, and he is not coming back for\r\ntwo days.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, they will all know I wouldn’t have taken you children out camping\r\nwith only Mr. Pearson along; besides Bobbie’s mother knows we didn’t\r\ntake any bedding along, and even if she didn’t, she would know that if\r\nwe had intended to be gone overnight you would have asked Bobbie to\r\ntake care of the chickens.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, what if they do know we meant to be back? They don’t\r\nknow where we are. Hunting the Rosalie Group over won’t find us.”\r\nThen he smiled a little grimly. “Do you know, Marian, it will be the\r\nchickens that will tell them about it? They won’t worry about us\r\nto-night; they will s’pose, of course, we will get in all right; but in\r\nthe morning all our chickens and old Peter Duck and Madam Waddle and\r\nthe whole brood of ’em will simply swoop down when Bobbie goes to feed\r\nhis chickens. Then they will begin to investigate. That’s all the good\r\nit will do them; they won’t find us,” he concluded moodily.\r\n\r\n“Marian,” he burst forth presently, unable in his nervous state to put\r\nup with his sister’s silence,--“Marian, what do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Delbert,” she answered, pausing in her work and looking up at him,\r\n“the biggest thing in my mind just now is that bunch of bananas we saw\r\nover on the other side.”\r\n\r\nDelbert’s eyes roved over the provisions before him. “How long will\r\nthis last us?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, I planned it for perhaps two meals for six people; as it\r\nhappens, there are only five to eat it, and we have Mr. Cunningham’s\r\neatables as well, you remember,”--she gave a little laugh. “You\r\nremember he said we were welcome to them, if we didn’t have enough of\r\nours.”\r\n\r\n“Huh! I should think so. You bet Mr. Cunningham would never do a dirty\r\ntrick like that. We--we can starve here for all Pearson knows or cares.”\r\n\r\nMarian put down the kettle and went to her brother, with his flushed\r\nface and flashing eyes winking back the tears. She drew the slender\r\nlittle form into her arms close and tipped up the handsome, quivering\r\nlittle face.\r\n\r\n“Delbert boy, darling,” she said softly, “we are not going to starve.\r\nThe children might if you and I were not here, but we are here; there\r\nare clams and crabs for the gathering, and I know a boy who, with his\r\njack-knife, can make a trap that will catch quail, and I once knew him\r\nto kill a rabbit with a bow and arrow.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and you scolded me for it, too,” he said.\r\n\r\n“I did. We didn’t need that bunny rabbit at all, but these babies are\r\ngoing to need feeding, and we shall have to feed them with whatever we\r\ncan get, rabbits or what. And we can take care of them, Delbert, you\r\nand I, till somebody comes. We will do it in spite of Mr. Pearson.”\r\n\r\n“Pearson!” said the boy fiercely; “he can just go to--to blazes.”\r\n\r\nMarian leaned down and kissed him. “No, dear,” she said lightly, “but\r\nhe may go to some other port and let the police catch him and send him\r\nand the launch back to Mr. Cunningham.”\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed chokily and, twining his arms about his sister’s waist,\r\nheld her closely while she stroked his hair.\r\n\r\n“No, darling,” she said presently, “we will not worry. You and I can do\r\na lot of things; you will see. Now, here come the girls with the crabs.\r\nWe mustn’t let them be frightened.”\r\n\r\nDelbert straightened up. “How many did you get?” he called, and Marian\r\nsmiled at the easy cheerfulness of his tone.\r\n\r\n“Oh, you will do,” she said approvingly, “you will do.”\r\n\r\nWhile she cooked and prepared the crabs, she sent the children off\r\nafter clams. Under Clarence’s tuition Delbert had become quite an\r\nexpert at finding clams, and fortunately they were plentiful. Marian,\r\npoor child, wondered how long one could live on an exclusive diet of\r\ncrabs and clams before getting utterly sick and tired of them.\r\n\r\nShe decided to put everybody on a rather short allowance of bread, so\r\nas to make it last longer and explained it to them when she called them\r\nup to eat. They did not mind; they preferred crabs anyway.\r\n\r\n“Marian,” said Delbert, “I can’t think of a thing between Mr. Pearson\r\nand Mr. Cunningham, except that Mr. Cunningham didn’t like his work\r\nwhen he first came and discharged him from the shop. But he has been\r\nworking somewhere else ever since; that needn’t have made him mad.”\r\n\r\n“Probably there is something that we don’t know about,” she said.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he persisted, “I bet Mr. Cunningham didn’t know about it\r\neither. He wouldn’t have sent him out with us if he hadn’t thought he\r\nwas all right. There was a fishline and hooks, too, in the locker,” he\r\ncontinued. “Did you see anything of them, Marian?”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. “He only left us the crackers and canned stuff--oh,\r\nand a box of matches, and I had another one in our basket.”\r\n\r\n“How many fires can we build with them?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“A good many, but we don’t need to use them; we can keep live coals\r\nover from one time to another, as papa does in the fireplace winters.\r\nThat is what we’ll do and use the matches only when we really have to.\r\nOn a sunshiny day I could light a fire with the crystal from my watch.”\r\n\r\nThey had never heard of such a thing, and Jennie and Esther wanted her\r\nto take it off and show them how at once.\r\n\r\nMarian declined. “We have a fire now,” she said. “The thing for us to\r\ndo is never to let it go out, day or night. If it goes out in spite of\r\nus, because of something we cannot help, then we can build one some\r\nother way.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t people on desert islands build signal fires?” asked Delbert.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and put out flags of distress, too. We couldn’t keep a fire going\r\n_all_ night, but we could put up one of the towels or the tablecloth\r\ndaytimes, and we can build our fire nights where it can be seen out at\r\nsea. And I think about the first thing we’d better do is to get up a\r\nwoodpile.”\r\n\r\nThat was an easy task. There was much driftwood along the beach,\r\nbesides the sticks that could be gathered from the hillside; and the\r\nchildren enjoyed gathering it up, and Marian would have also if she had\r\nnot been inwardly so perplexed and worried.\r\n\r\nTo add to her worries, the sky turned cloudy and the wind rose. Suppose\r\nit were to storm, and she with not even a tent to shelter these little\r\nones!\r\n\r\n“Delbert,” she asked, finally, “isn’t there a cave on this Island?”\r\n\r\n“Sure,” he answered; “right down here a way. Let’s go see.”\r\n\r\nMarian’s hopes rose, only to fall again when she viewed the cave. It\r\nstood barely above high tide, a dark hole, foul and ill-smelling from\r\nthe myriads of bats that lived in it.\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” she said, “we can’t sleep in this, Delbert. Besides, if a\r\nstorm should come up, the water would wash right in.”\r\n\r\n“It goes back a long way,” said Delbert. “Clarence and I went in with a\r\ntorch, but the farther you go the smellier it gets. Phew! No, I should\r\nsay we couldn’t sleep in it. If it’s a cave to sleep in that you want,\r\nI guess we shall have to hunt one up.”\r\n\r\nSo they climbed back up the hill and began an investigation of the\r\nbig masses of rock which at that end of the Island looked as if some\r\ngiant hand had tossed them up and they had since lain in the same wild\r\nconfusion in which they fell.\r\n\r\nIt would be very strange, thought Marian, if some sort of shelter\r\ncould not be found among these. But she had no luck. Several places\r\nshe discovered that would have been ideal in pleasant weather, an\r\noverhanging rock to keep off the dew, or a thick, dry, mossy bed, but\r\nwhen wind and rain were to be considered--\r\n\r\nFinally Delbert called to her from a point farther up than she had yet\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n“O Marian, here is a sort of a crack; maybe it would do.”\r\n\r\nShe scrambled over the intervening rocks and surveyed the “crack,” and\r\nthough it was far from being what she wanted, she saw at once that it\r\nwas the best place they had yet found.\r\n\r\nIt might, perhaps, have been called a miniature cave. It was not high\r\nenough to stand up in, but extended back some ten or twelve feet,\r\ngrowing smaller and smaller, till at its extreme end it was not more\r\nthan a foot in height. Its width was about the same as its depth.\r\nA few feet away from the opening rose another rock, a smooth-faced,\r\ngigantic mass that would keep the worst of the wind and rain away from\r\nthe mouth of the cave, or crack, as Delbert called it.\r\n\r\n“I believe it is the best we can do,” she said. “We could at least keep\r\ndry and warm in there. All the other places would be good only in good\r\nweather. We’ll get some sticks and poke around and see if there are any\r\nsnakes or anything.”\r\n\r\nDelbert promptly followed the suggestion. He crept in and punched and\r\npoked most industriously and raked and scraped with energy, but could\r\nstart nothing, and he declared there did not seem to be any cracks\r\nleading any farther back.\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, then,” said Marian. “I didn’t want to dispute the\r\nright of way with any snakes or centipedes. Now we’d better go down to\r\nthe bananas and get a lot of dried banana leaves to help out our bed.”\r\n\r\nThis they did, gathering an enormous bundle and tying it with the\r\nlariat rope. Then Marian slung it over her shoulder and so with a very\r\nlittle assistance conveyed it to the Cave.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was getting late in the afternoon. The sun had\r\ndisappeared completely from the gray sky, and the wind had risen so\r\nthat there was no doubt at all about the approach of a storm.\r\n\r\n“We must bring everything up,” decided Marian. “Everything must come\r\nunder shelter here right away. We must not leave even the dig-spoon\r\ndown on the beach.” She was seized with a nervous dread of the water,\r\nwhich was already rolling in higher than usual.\r\n\r\nThe little feet got tired of going up and down the rocky hillside, but\r\nMarian and Delbert persevered till everything, even the wood they had\r\ngathered, was safe at the Cave. Then Marian arranged things as best\r\nshe could for the night. She packed their belongings, so that they\r\nwould be some shelter for the bed of banana leaves and blessed Bobbie’s\r\nmother for the big cape, which, with Jennie’s pinned to it, would serve\r\nas a third blanket. Then she built a fire back of the big rock that\r\nsheltered the mouth of their cave bedroom, and cooked the clams for\r\ntheir supper.\r\n\r\nThe children huddled together by the fire. They were enjoying the\r\nexperience. Marian was big; she would take care of them; and it is\r\nfun to cuddle down behind a big rock and watch your supper cook over a\r\ndancing camp-fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOKED THE CLAMS FOR SUPPER]\r\n\r\nAfter supper Marian carefully packed a solid chunk of wood in a bed of\r\ncoals, covered these with ashes and dirt, and piled little rocks over\r\nthem to protect them from the rain that she felt sure would come in\r\nabundantly before morning. She kept a fire going for light, as they\r\nhad no lamp or lantern of any description.\r\n\r\nThe children were tired and willing to go to bed after they had eaten,\r\nand Marian herself was fully ready to lie down after she had got them\r\nall packed away. She slept, too, for a while, but when the storm came\r\nit wakened her, and there was no more sleep for her all that long, long\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe roar of the sea was terrific; the big waves were sweeping in from\r\nthe sea and breaking on the beach with thundering crashes. The flashes\r\nof the lightning were intense, and the thunder seemed to Marian to\r\nshake the very earth. She had thought they would be protected from\r\nthe wind, but it seemed to sweep over them with perfect freedom. She\r\nshivered and shrank closer to the children. Davie was next to her. He\r\nseemed to be warm and comfortable and he slept peacefully in all that\r\npandemonium. Poor little chap, he had been all worn out climbing up\r\nand down the hill and chasing crabs on the beach. The others woke, and\r\nMarian anxiously inquired if they were all warm. Delbert said his feet\r\nwere cold, but aside from that all were fairly comfortable. Crowded in\r\ntogether as they were, they kept one another warm.\r\n\r\nBut they were frightened, and no wonder! The storm outside was a\r\nregular tempest, and they were cooped in that little hole, sheltered\r\nfrom the rain, indeed, but exposed to everything else.\r\n\r\nThey were afraid the rock roof would fall and crush them, that the\r\nlightning would strike them, and Jennie was afraid the water would wash\r\nup to where they were.\r\n\r\nMarian knew there was no danger of the first and no probable danger of\r\nthe second, and she knew they were far beyond the reach of anything\r\nless than an actual tidal wave that might engulf the whole Island.\r\n\r\nShe soothed and reassured them by every argument she could think of,\r\nand then she sang to them all the songs she could call up that might\r\ntend to reassure the shrinking human spirit at such a time, beginning\r\nwith\r\n\r\n  “The Lord’s our Rock; in Him we hide,\r\n   A shelter in the time of storm”;\r\n\r\nand finishing with a rollicking glee with a rousing chorus that\r\nannounced that\r\n\r\n  “We’re all right, all safe and tight,\r\n   Let ’er howl, Bill, let ’er howl!”\r\n\r\nAnd indeed “she” was howling outside so furiously that it was only\r\nbecause Marian’s lips were so close to their ears that they could hear\r\nher songs at all.\r\n\r\nSome time along toward morning the thunder and lightning ceased, and\r\nthough the rain still came down in a steady pour, the wind still blew,\r\nand the waves still thundered on the beach, one by one the children\r\ndropped off to sleep. Marian did not. She lay there in a cramped,\r\nuncomfortable position, for to change it meant to get out from under\r\nthe covering and expose the children to more of the cold wind. She\r\nwondered where Pearson was passing the night. How she longed for\r\nmorning, yet when it came it brought little enough of relief. The worst\r\nfury of the storm seemed to be over, but the wind was still high and\r\nthere was some rain.\r\n\r\nMarian’s carefully banked fire was utterly drenched and washed away,\r\nand she had to light a new one with a precious match. She built it\r\nunder shelter of the Cave, and then the smoke nearly drove them out\r\ninto the storm.\r\n\r\nThere was some of the clam soup left from supper, and, reinforcing it\r\nwith one of Mr. Cunningham’s cans of corn, she was able to fill them\r\nall up with a hot breakfast.\r\n\r\nThey could not see anything because of the big rock in front of the\r\nCave, and to go out past the range of it meant to be drenched, or at\r\nleast dampened, and every one but Davie could see that that would not\r\ndo. The little girls could stand up in the wider part of the Cave, but\r\nwhen Delbert forgot himself and tried it he got such a bump that he\r\nfairly cried with the pain.\r\n\r\nMarian smoothed up their bed and packed the food back into the basket,\r\nand then racked her brain for methods of amusement. There was not much\r\nthat could be done, but they played a few simple little games that\r\ncould be played while sitting still, and really, all things considered,\r\ngot on marvelously well.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon there was a cessation of wind and rain for a while,\r\nso that they did venture out a little, but Marian was so fearful of\r\ntheir getting their clothes damp that it was not much diversion, after\r\nall. Of course, every tree was loaded with drops of water that the\r\nslightest shake released, and the ground under foot was soaked and\r\nrunning in little rivulets.\r\n\r\nThe second night was only less miserable than the first. There was no\r\nstorm to frighten them, and they slept more, but they were colder and\r\nmore uncomfortable when they were awake, which was really a good deal\r\nof the time, after all. By morning the wind had died down and the sun\r\nwas struggling to break through the remaining clouds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Bobbie went to feed his chickens on the evening of the day\r\nthe launch party went out, his little round, freckled face wore an\r\nunusually sober expression. As he tossed out the handfuls of corn, he\r\ngazed out over the waters regretfully. The way of the transgressor\r\nis hard certainly, but only the last part of the way, the first part\r\nis most remarkably easy. He had been down on the pier that fateful\r\nmorning with his mother’s full knowledge and consent,--nothing wrong\r\nin that,--and when the fishing-boat was ready, the men had said, “Come\r\nalong, Bobbie,” and “Come, jump in if you want to, kid,” and there was\r\nno time to go and ask his mother; they would not have waited for him\r\nif he had; even his mother admitted that. There was no time to go and\r\nask, so he had gone without asking, and see what he had had to suffer\r\non account of it. One whole week already with no diversions besides\r\nschool and errands, and another, dreary with monotony, stretching ahead\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nTo-day had been worst of all, with the Hadley house closed and silent,\r\nand Bobbie knew they would have asked him to go with them if it had not\r\nbeen for that ill-fated fishing-trip.\r\n\r\nHe heaved a sigh and flung out the last kernels, and then, as many of\r\nDelbert’s chickens were hungrily helping themselves and the launch was\r\nnot yet in sight, he went over to the Hadley yard, climbed through the\r\nshed window, and measured out the amount of corn he knew Delbert always\r\nfed his flock. After he had given it to the eager biddies, he went\r\nback home, and a little later, when he ran out to shut up his own, he\r\nwent over and closed Delbert’s coop also, first carefully counting the\r\ninmates, as he knew Delbert always did. When he found one was missing,\r\nhe searched till he found the silly thing perched on a barrel in the\r\nyard, a tempting meal for coyotes, and, hustling the misguided fowl\r\ninto the coop, closed the door securely. It was a service that he and\r\nDelbert performed for each other so often that he did not even mention\r\nthe matter to his mother, and she, busy with her household tasks, gave\r\nthe launch party scarcely a thought, and supposed, of course, it came\r\nhome on time.\r\n\r\nThe storm was the worst the Port had known for years. Bobbie might\r\nhave saved himself the trouble of closing the coops so carefully, for\r\nboth were blown to pieces, and numbers of the chickens of each were\r\ndrowned. People had no thought or time to spare for chickens and their\r\ncoops. Roofs were sent flying, and many a wall had to be braced and\r\nwatched through the wild night. While Bobbie’s mother hurried to and\r\nfro, moving things out from under the leaks in the roof, quieting her\r\nfrightened children, and keeping general watch and ward, she thought of\r\nthe Hadleys and spoke of them to her husband.\r\n\r\n“Marian’s kitchen roof is probably leaking like a sieve,” she said,\r\n“but I guess the rest of the house is all right.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, “I was just thinking it was lucky Hadley fixed\r\nthings up so well before he left. As it is, it is the safest house in\r\ntown.”\r\n\r\n“Dear me!” cried the lady suddenly, discovering a stream of water\r\ncoming down in a corner hitherto considered safe and dry, “I only wish\r\nours was. Half the things I have will be utterly ruined if this keeps\r\nup.”\r\n\r\n“And it is going to keep up all right,” was the consoling reply of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nIn the gray morning, when the storm abated and men in waterproofs began\r\nto venture out and take stock of the damage done and compare notes, it\r\nwas discovered that the launch had not come back; that while frailer\r\nshelters had gone crashing down, compelling their inmates to flee\r\nthrough the storm to other shelters, the “safest house in town” had\r\nstood untenanted and alone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Hadley, hurried back from Guaymas by the awful news,\r\nreached the Port, every foot of the Rosalie Group had been searched\r\nover. On one had been found a child’s handkerchief beaten into the\r\nsand. They gave it to Mrs. Hadley, and she looked at it a moment\r\nsilently. Just a ragged, soiled little thing it was, with a faint trace\r\nof what had once been a picture printed in bright colors.\r\n\r\n“It’s Esther’s,” said the mother, and she put it away, the most\r\nsacred of her treasures. As a matter of fact, it was not Esther’s at\r\nall,--Esther had hers with her at that moment,--but the grimy little\r\nrag was taken for evidence indisputable that the launch party had been\r\non that particular island.\r\n\r\nOver and over the boats went out and searched. All of the Rosalies,\r\nall of the _esteros_ and marshy mud flats for many miles were gone\r\ncarefully over, not, indeed, with any hope now of discovering the lost\r\nones, but for some trace, some sign, something washed from the wreck.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Cunningham returned, he declared himself completely mystified.\r\nHe knew the launch was in perfect condition when it went out that\r\nmorning, for he had examined it himself; and he knew Pearson was in\r\nevery way competent to run it. There had been plenty of warning of the\r\noncoming of the storm, plenty of time to have returned in safety.\r\n\r\nBut the launch did not return; it had gone out into the blue, and the\r\nblue had swallowed it entirely. The waves lapped, lapped on the rocks\r\nand little beaches, the seabirds swooped and called to one another, and\r\nin time even the gray-haired father gave up the search, and he and his\r\nquiet, sweet-faced wife packed up all their belongings and left the\r\nscene of their terrible sorrow.\r\n\r\nOnly one person had advanced any theory other than that the launch\r\nparty had been in some way wrecked and lost in the storm. One man had\r\nsuggested that perhaps Marian and Pearson had eloped,--an idea that\r\ncaused more than a few smiles even at that time, for an eloping couple\r\nwould have been _so_ likely to take the lady’s four small brothers and\r\nsisters with them. Just how any accident could have occurred was a\r\nmystery, but that one had happened no one doubted.\r\n\r\nOld Mr. Faston had, indeed, told of Delbert’s remark to him that they\r\nwere going to Smugglers’ Island, but Bobbie and the other children told\r\nof playing pirate and smuggler on a sandbar of one of the Rosalies,\r\nand the childish game was, of course, thought to be the reason of\r\nDelbert’s statement.\r\n\r\nSo time passed. The Hadleys had gone from the Port, Delbert’s chickens\r\nwere added to Bobbie’s flock, a Mexican family moved into “the safest\r\nhouse in town,” Mr. Cunningham bought a new launch, and, so far as the\r\nPort was concerned, the incident was closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCOMMISSARY MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nBut for Marian in the midst of her hungry, grimy little flock the\r\nincident was far from closed. Indeed, it was only begun.\r\n\r\nWhen their food was all gone but the can of tomatoes and a part of\r\nthe crackers, she made up her mind that nothing but accidental help\r\ncould be looked for. No one, not even her parents, knew anything\r\nabout Smugglers’ Island, and probably they were thought to have\r\nperished in the storm. Perhaps Mr. Pearson had been swamped and\r\ndrowned. In the course of time some one would come into San Moros for\r\nsomething,--Indians hunting turtles maybe,--but it might be long months\r\nbefore they saw a human being besides themselves. There was no one to\r\nrely upon but themselves; whatever was done they must do themselves.\r\n\r\nLooking at the cluster of tousled heads, Marian set her teeth together\r\nand clenched her hands tightly. The fierce protective spirit of\r\nmotherhood swept over her. They were hers, these little ones; come\r\nwhat would, they should not perish, they should be fed, sheltered,\r\ncared for. They should have their child’s rights of tender love and\r\nhappiness. Esther, running up just then, was caught in a close embrace\r\nand kissed fervently.\r\n\r\nThe Cave afforded the best shelter for night that they could find. As\r\nsoon as things were dried up a little from the storm, Marian set about\r\nimproving it somewhat. For tools she had only the hatchet, Esther’s\r\nspade, the dig-spoon, and Delbert’s knife and lariat.\r\n\r\nWith the hatchet she cut sticks and brush and with the lariat dragged\r\nthem up to the Cave, where she and Delbert made them as best they could\r\ninto a sort of roof for the space between the Cave and the big rock\r\nin front. It was crude work, of course, but it gave shade and to some\r\nextent served as a wind-break, at least. It was just high enough to\r\nstand up under.\r\n\r\nA place to cook over was soon made of a few rocks, and then Marian\r\nturned her attention to the securing of food other than crabs and\r\nclams. First there was the banana-patch. Not finding any good way of\r\nreaching up to the bunch they found there, they cut the stalk it was\r\non, first looking carefully to see that there was no other bunch on the\r\nsame stalk. Later on they learned that each stalk bears but a single\r\nbunch anyway.\r\n\r\nUnquestionably those were the worst bananas that Marian had ever seen\r\nin her life. Not only was the fruit small and dwarfed, but about half\r\nof each banana was a dry, brown pith, while what remained was very far\r\nfrom being good. But they were food, and Marian conveyed that bunch of\r\nbananas to the Cave with the greatest of care.\r\n\r\nThen with the hatchet and knife they cut down a great many other\r\nstalks and dragged them out of the way, so that they could get about\r\nin the patch and see what was there. It was not the pleasantest work\r\nin the world, for they had to keep a sharp lookout for ugly, crawling\r\nthings. They found, however, several other sickly-looking bunches and\r\nquite a number of birds’ nests. These last Marian was careful to leave\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nDelbert was anxious to fly a signal flag, and as Marian was wearing an\r\nextra petticoat, she decided to dedicate it to that purpose.\r\n\r\nBut it was a question where was the best place to fly it. There were no\r\nvery tall trees, and no place where it did not seem to her that a flag\r\nwould blend with the background. She had really very little hope of its\r\ndoing any good, but she did not suggest that to the children.\r\n\r\nAt last they picked out a tree and, after considerable discussion as to\r\nways and means and several ineffectual attempts, finally succeeded in\r\nattaching the white skirt to one of the higher branches, where Delbert\r\nwas sure it would be seen if any one chanced into San Moros.\r\n\r\nDelbert was continually mourning that they had no fishhooks and lines.\r\nHe and Bobbie had been famous fishers,--in their own estimations, at\r\nleast,--and he was quite sure that if he only had a hook and line he\r\nwould be able to haul out innumerable fish from the quiet water about\r\nthe little rock pier. Marian searched through their belongings and not\r\na hook could she find, and all her thread was rather fine. But though\r\ncrabs and clams were good, it took a great many of them to satisfy five\r\npeople three times a day, and it took more time to prepare them than\r\nMarian wanted to spend. She declared that she would not open the can of\r\ntomatoes till they were actually starving and could not get anything\r\nelse, and she put them on an allowance of one cracker apiece each meal.\r\nDavie often howled for more, but Marian resolutely put them where he\r\ncould not get them for himself, and his lusty wails availed him nothing.\r\n\r\nA few quail occasionally wandered into Delbert’s traps and from\r\nthere into Marian’s kettle, but Marian was not content, and one day\r\nshe braided her hair in two braids down her back and tried her hand\r\nat making fishhooks out of her wire hairpins. She had not brought\r\nher shears with her, but in her bag was a pair of little buttonhole\r\nscissors that could be made to serve as plyers, perhaps, and her pretty\r\npearl-handled penknife had a nail-file on one blade. She could not put\r\nbarbs on her hooks, but she could sharpen them with the file. As one\r\nhairpin by itself was not strong enough, she straightened out three and\r\nbound them tightly together with embroidery silk.\r\n\r\nAfter working faithfully all her spare time, one day she finished a\r\nhook that she and Delbert were both sure would work. Then came the\r\nquestion of a line.\r\n\r\n“Delbert,” she said, “quite a while ago wasn’t Bobbie’s Uncle Jim\r\nteaching you boys how to braid round whiplashes? Yes? Well, do you\r\nremember now how he did it?”\r\n\r\n“I guess I do,” said the boy slowly; “but you haven’t got near enough\r\nthread to make a line strong enough to amount to shucks. That colored\r\nsilk would be all right, but you’ve got only a teenty bit of that.”\r\n\r\nMarian smiled. “Why is your rope better than a common one?” she asked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“’Cause it’s hair and it won’t rot and wear out like the fiber ones.”\r\n\r\nMarian was unbraiding one of the long braids that hung over her\r\nshoulder and with the scissors she snipped out here and there, where it\r\nwould not show, quite a number of tresses.\r\n\r\n“Here,” she said, “you get busy now and let’s see if you know how to\r\nbraid a nice, smooth, round line, and then you can show me how, too.”\r\n\r\n“O Marian, your pretty, pretty hair!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know; it has been my pretty hair all my life, and it’s high\r\ntime it was useful as well as ornamental.”\r\n\r\nBut it took a long time to braid the line, and food had to be secured\r\nmeantime. Food!--that was the main topic of conversation,--to find\r\nclams, to get big crabs, to make traps and set and watch them\r\nafterwards. Never a fish was sighted but they wondered if it was good\r\nto eat; never a bird flew over but they discussed whether or not it\r\nwould cook up tender. Delbert used to go twice a day, at least, to\r\nlook over his traps. Simple things they were, made of sticks fastened\r\ntogether with strips of rag torn from the towel that had been wrapped\r\naround the bread, and afterwards of the fibrous stems of the banana\r\nleaves. Every day he saw rabbits, and one day he threw a stone that hit\r\none on the head and stunned it, and he despatched it with his knife. He\r\ndid not seem to mind killing the things that got into his traps, and\r\nMarian was glad he did not, since it had to be done.\r\n\r\nIt was after the rabbit incident that the little boy came in one day\r\nfrom making the round of the traps, holding by the tail a good-sized\r\nrattlesnake.\r\n\r\n“Mercy!” cried Marian, “how did you kill that?”\r\n\r\n“With sticks and stones,” he answered. “He was right there in the path\r\nby my last trap, and I settled his hash in a jiffy. Say, Marian, he\r\nlooks nice and fat. Bobbie’s Uncle Jim says they are as good eating as\r\neel.”\r\n\r\nMarian gasped, “Snakes!” But the clams were getting scarce in the\r\nimmediate vicinity, and she had even begun to imagine that the crabs\r\nwere not quite so plentiful on the little sand-beaches.\r\n\r\n“The history says,” continued Delbert, “that when the Spaniards were\r\nconquering this country and South America, sometimes when parties were\r\nsent out to go to places and got lost and wandered around, they had to\r\neat roots and snakes and toads.”\r\n\r\nMarian was thinking she had certainly heard of people eating\r\nrattlesnakes and--well--“All right,” she said, turning away to the\r\nconstruction of the fishline, “you skin it, Delbert, and I’ll cook it.”\r\n\r\nThe filtered water in the demijohn did not last very long, of course,\r\nand when it was gone Marian marshaled all hands to clean out the\r\nspring. She usually marshaled all hands when there was anything to be\r\ndone, because somehow she could not bear to have any of the children\r\nout of her sight for any length of time. When they were with her she\r\nknew they were safe. True, there seemed to be little danger of any\r\nkind, save that they were surrounded with plenty of water to drown in,\r\nand there was no knowing how many more rattlesnakes the Island might\r\npossibly contain.\r\n\r\nShe had hoped that when she got the stones cleared away the spring\r\nwould reveal itself as something extra good in the way of water-supply,\r\nbut it did not. Indeed, she was reluctantly forced to the conclusion\r\nthat it was no spring at all, only a shallow little well.\r\n\r\nIn the rainy season the water falling on these islands sinks into the\r\nsand and stays there. One could find fresh water any time by digging at\r\na little distance back from the beach, where the sand lay in hills and\r\nhollows, and Marian concluded that the only reason why the water came\r\nto the surface in that particular spot was because it was situated in a\r\ndecided depression of the ground.\r\n\r\nSo she dug and scooped till she had a hole with about a foot of water\r\nin it, and then she smoothed the sides and laid rocks so the sandy\r\nsoil should not cave in. From the tracks abounding in the vicinity she\r\nconcluded that the deer and burros both were accustomed to drink there,\r\nand while she was willing that they should continue to do so, she did\r\nnot want them poking their noses into the very pool that she must dip\r\nfrom for her little flock; so she made a cover with some sticks and\r\npieces of driftwood and some stones to keep them in place, and then,\r\nto be still surer, she hollowed out another place for her four-footed\r\nneighbors. The old dig-spoon and the little spade were her chief tools\r\nin these labors.\r\n\r\n“Dear me! Delbert,” she said playfully, “why didn’t we have sense\r\nenough to bring a hoe and shovel with us?”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” he retorted gloomily, “if we had had any sense we’d have stayed\r\nat home.”\r\n\r\n“There may be something in that too,” she answered.\r\n\r\n“I know what I could do if you had brought your shears,” spoke up\r\nJennie.\r\n\r\n“What, dear?”\r\n\r\n“I’d cut a thing from this,” holding up the piece of tin cut from the\r\nend of one of the cans of corn, “that Delbert could spear fish with.”\r\n\r\nDelbert stared at her a minute, and then with one of his nervously\r\nquick movements possessed himself of the ragged bit of tin.\r\n\r\nMarian had opened the can with his knife. He looked at it a moment and\r\nspoke excitedly. “We could! It wouldn’t be like a regular spear-head,\r\nbut we could catch ’em. I know just how the Indians throw them. Bobbie\r\nhas one, but he’s never caught anything yet.”\r\n\r\nThe idea was certainly worth trying. Marian would not ruin her precious\r\nbuttonhole scissors cutting tin with them, but she scratched the\r\npattern in the bit of tin and then went over it with the tip of the\r\nbutcher-knife, denting it; and the dents, made deeper and deeper,\r\nfinally became holes, and then soon there was her spear-head, such as\r\nit was, needing only to be smoothed up a little and filed and bound on\r\nthe end of a smooth, slender stick that Delbert had been preparing.\r\n\r\nMarian split the end of the stick a little and slipped in the bit of\r\ntin and bound the stick with thread that she had doubled and twisted\r\ntill it was strong enough to suit her, then tied the lariat rope to the\r\nother end of the stick.\r\n\r\nDelbert spent the next day in exercising the new tool. His patience was\r\ncertainly marvelous. Hour after hour went by with no success, but he\r\nwas sure he would be successful some other time.\r\n\r\n“I’ll get on to it after a while,” he said, as they ate their supper of\r\nhot clam soup. “Those Indians at the Port catch them right along.”\r\n\r\n“The thread will soon rot out,” said Marian. “I ought to have wire to\r\nwrap the end with; copper wire would be best. There are two hairpins\r\nleft, but they are so short I can’t fix them, I’m afraid.”\r\n\r\nIt was fully a week afterwards before it dawned upon her that she had\r\nin the edge of her hat-brim a nice piece of copper wire that just\r\nfilled the bill, and though its removal left the brim rather droopy,\r\nthat was a small matter.\r\n\r\nTheir supper they always ate at the Cave, as the light of their fire\r\ncould be seen far out from there; but breakfasts and dinners were\r\nusually eaten down on the beach to save the trouble of carrying food\r\nand water up the hill. Marian had built a second place for cooking down\r\nin the shadow of the big rocks where they had eaten their first dinner\r\non the Island, and the children had dug a well in a hollow of the sand\r\nnot far off, which they used, although the water did not seem to be so\r\ngood as that on the other side of the Island, having more of a salty\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nAs Marian was carefully dipping water from the beach well one morning,\r\nJennie and Esther came running to her in great excitement.\r\n\r\n“O Marian, come quick! The High-Tide Pool is full of fish, and Delbert\r\nis going to spear them all!”\r\n\r\nThis was interesting, certainly. The High-Tide Pool was down quite a\r\nway from where they had the well and the cooking-place. It was beyond\r\nthe sandy beach, where the rocks ran down into the water. When the tide\r\nwas high it had considerable depth, and ran back into a little cave\r\namong the rocks, but at low tide the water was only two or three feet\r\ndeep in its deepest part, which was in the cave.\r\n\r\nSometimes they had seen a few little fish in it before, but that\r\nmorning the little girls had gone down and found it well stocked.\r\n\r\nProbably just as the tide was going out, a great number had taken\r\nrefuge there. Perhaps some enemy was lurking outside and they dared not\r\nleave the safe retreat, and now they could not leave it till high tide\r\ncame again.\r\n\r\nDelbert was spearing industriously when Marian got there. He had\r\nactually caught one, and it flapped feebly on the rocks beside him.\r\n\r\nAs his sister came up, he triumphantly called her attention to it.\r\n\r\n“See that? Told you I could spear fish! But they all want to hide back\r\nthere in the cave. I tell you, Marian, I’ll go in there and drive them\r\nout, and you can stand here and spear them. We’ll just keep spearing\r\nand spearing till the tide comes in and the rest get away. I bet we can\r\nget enough for several days. We can dry ’em as the Mexicans do.”\r\n\r\nHe handed her the spear and began hastily to disrobe. Delbert’s\r\nmovements were always hasty.\r\n\r\nMarian began casting the spear unsuccessfully, but when Delbert got\r\ninto the pool he created such a commotion that several of the fish in\r\ntheir wild endeavor to escape, flopped clear out on the bare rocks and\r\nwere easily captured. By that time a better idea had come to Marian.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIAN HAD BEEN CASTING THE SPEAR UNSUCCESSFULLY WHEN\r\nDELBERT GOT INTO THE POOL]\r\n\r\n“O Delbert,” she cried, “come out now, wipe up on my apron and get back\r\ninto your clothes. We have enough for breakfast and dinner, too.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but we want all we can get,” he called back. “We can dry ’em, I\r\ntell you, and as soon as the tide is high again they will all get away.”\r\n\r\n“That’s all right, but listen! I have a scheme for keeping them all.\r\nThis is too good a thing to let the tide take away from us. Why, there\r\nmust be fish enough in there to last us a week at least, maybe two.\r\nSee, Delbert, we must build some kind of a fence across, so they can’t\r\nget away when high tide does come. Then we can come every day and get\r\nwhat we want till they are all gone.”\r\n\r\nDelbert splashed right out without more remarks.\r\n\r\n“We can do it with rocks and sticks and brush,” she continued. “It\r\nwon’t be possible to drive stakes in the ground here, because it isn’t\r\nground,--it is all rock,--but we can make them stand firm by piling\r\nrocks around them.”\r\n\r\nShe went to work systematically. She set the children to bringing\r\nrocks, while she and Delbert cut the stakes and brush up on the\r\nhillside and dragged them down with the rope. Then, selecting the place\r\nwhere she could accomplish her purpose with the least labor, she set a\r\nrow of stakes a little way apart, piling rocks about each one till it\r\nwas quite firm and solid, and then began weaving in brush.\r\n\r\nIt was a long task. Trip after trip she made up the hillside with the\r\nrope and hatchet, and her face and hands were scratched with the thorny\r\nbrush. The children grew tired of helping, and Davie was crying because\r\nhe was hungry, for Marian would not stop to prepare food. She dared\r\nnot. In that little pool was food, food. If she could shut the way\r\nacross before the tide came in, then she and her little ones were safe\r\nwithout question for some time to come; if not--“Why, Delbert,” she\r\nsaid, “we might live here for years before we should have such a chance\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\nFinally she sent him up to start a fire and clean the fish they had got\r\nbefore they began the fence, and when he had them in the kettle over\r\nthe flames he returned to help her. Thereafter she would occasionally\r\nsend up the little girls to put on more wood or to pour a little more\r\nwater into the kettle, but she herself kept at the task.\r\n\r\nMarian did thorough work; she dared not slight it in a single place;\r\nit must be strong enough to resist the force of the waves, and it must\r\nbe so solid that no fish of any considerable size could get through,\r\nand she dared not stop, she dared not stop. The tide began creeping\r\nback over the rocks, and she sent the children back for more brush\r\nand sticks, and more still, and went herself again, and still again,\r\nand now the water was running over into the pool again, and still she\r\nworked. She knew how high up on the rocks it would be when the tide\r\nwas at its full height, and she must get above that. She had done the\r\nwork well so far, yet it would all be in vain if she did not get above\r\nhigh-water mark.\r\n\r\nFinally she finished it with the water waist-deep around her, and as\r\nshe dragged herself out, it seemed as if she had never been so tired\r\nin all her life before, but she was sure that her work was done well.\r\nTired and hungry and smarting from scratches and the thorns she had\r\nnot had time to remove, she was yet happy. For the first time since\r\nPearson’s treachery had left them stranded there, she felt a firm\r\nfoundation under her feet.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the little girls’ care the fire had gone out under the\r\nkettle and the fish were not done. They were not very trustworthy as\r\ncooks yet, but Marian started things going again and sent Jennie up\r\nto the Cave for a blanket and some safety-pins and a needle from her\r\nworkbag.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back, Marian removed her wet clothing and donned the\r\nblanket in its stead, pinning it in place with the safety-pins, and\r\nthen proceeded to extract thorns with the needle. Delbert also required\r\nsome of the same surgical attention. Then, as soon as the fish were\r\ndone, they broke their fast, and afterwards she took Davie and lay down\r\nin the shadow of a rock to sleep, secure in the knowledge that there\r\nwere fish enough in the kettle for one more meal and that there were\r\nplenty more where they came from.\r\n\r\nThe fencing-in of High-Tide Pool certainly marked a new period in\r\nthe life on the Island. It was the first work of any size, and its\r\ncompletion gave assurance of food for many days to come without\r\nspending all their time in the securing of it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Marian bent her energies on the fishline to the exclusion\r\nof everything else till it was finished. It took the two extra hairpins\r\nto fasten the hook and line together satisfactorily, but Marian did\r\nnot grudge hairpins nor time nor labor when she saw how eager the\r\nfish of High-Tide Pool seemed to be to attach themselves to that\r\namateurish-looking implement. She thought the fence she had built\r\nprobably served, to some extent, to screen out the smaller fish that\r\nwould otherwise have provided breakfasts and luncheons for those she\r\nhad imprisoned. At any rate, their appetites seemed to be excellent,\r\nanything was acceptable as bait, and Delbert was now and then\r\nsuccessful in spearing one.\r\n\r\nThey worked another day on the banana-patch, thinning it out and\r\nletting in the sunlight, and another in dragging more brush up to the\r\nCave to shade and shelter it, and in carrying up more dried banana\r\nleaves for their bed.\r\n\r\nThen Marian said she was ready to go on an exploring expedition.\r\n\r\nSo far they had gone no great way from the end of the Island where they\r\nhad landed, but now she decided the time had come to learn more of\r\ntheir locality. Some of the bananas were ripe; that is, they were soft\r\nand could be eaten. They could take them along for lunch.\r\n\r\nDelbert was a little afraid some one might come while they were gone,\r\nbut Marian had a lead-pencil in her workbag and with it she wrote\r\non a smooth piece of driftwood a brief account of their predicament\r\nwhich she left in a prominent position near the tree their signal flag\r\nflapped on. To make assurance doubly sure, they put another signal flag\r\nby the side of the notice.\r\n\r\nNot being sure they could find water on all parts of the Island,\r\nMarian thought it would be safest to carry some with them, but the\r\nonly thing she had to carry it in was the two-quart Mason jar that had\r\nheld Davie’s milk. They would take Mr. Cunningham’s pail, too, and\r\nthe spear and lariat and hatchet. It seemed to Marian that that was\r\nall they would need, but Davie was very sure the dig-spoon would be\r\nindispensable, so he carried that also.\r\n\r\nThey went along on top of the hill where Delbert had set his traps. It\r\nwas very rocky at first, but became more even and level, with fewer\r\nrocks, and more open and grassy. There was an abundance of thorny\r\nbrush, but no trees of any size worth mentioning. This portion of the\r\nIsland they used afterwards to refer to as the pasture. Beyond it the\r\nthorny tangle became thicker again, and here were more rocks. Indeed,\r\nthe farther end of the Island fell quite precipitously to the water\r\nwithout any sandy beaches, but they could make their way down well\r\nenough, and most of the way could follow the shoreline without wading.\r\n\r\nThe Island was fairly uniform in shape, and it looked to Marian as\r\nif it had been broken as a whole from the mainland ages back, the\r\nsides there being very steep and precipitous, as was the shore of the\r\nmainland opposite. The little harbor did not seem to extend very far,\r\nand no vessel of any size could have picked her way through behind the\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe seaward side contained various little bays and coves, very\r\nfascinating to explore, but only one of these was of any size. This\r\nlay in such a relation to the tides and currents that it gathered more\r\nof the flotsam and jetsam of the sea than any or all of the others,\r\nand when its treasure possibilities were realized it was named Bonanza\r\nCove.\r\n\r\nThese details were not all learned in one day’s exploration, but little\r\nby little as day after day they searched and learned.\r\n\r\nAlways supreme above all other motives was the search for food.\r\n\r\nEvery plant or root or berry that they knew to be edible they eagerly\r\nseized upon, and Marian was constantly warning them lest they grow\r\ncareless in their selection and suffer thereby.\r\n\r\nOne day they found the burros all down by the water-hole on the\r\nlandlocked side of the Island. They had seen them before, about a dozen\r\nin number, but had not paid much attention to them. They were grazing\r\npeacefully on the outskirts of the banana-patch, and the children were\r\nquick to notice that the herd had been increased by one in the last day\r\nor two, a silky-looking little fellow with that peculiarly fascinating\r\nquality that only a baby burro has.\r\n\r\nIn glee they ran toward them, but though the burros seemed to be not\r\nat all wild, they plainly did not mean to permit any actual handling\r\nand skillfully evaded all attempts in that direction. After several\r\nineffective attempts to round up the woolly baby, the children stopped\r\nto rest and regain their breath, and the four-legged infant sidled up\r\nto his mother and proceeded to lunch.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Marian turned to her brother. “Delbert,” she said, “can you\r\nlasso that old burro as she stands there?”\r\n\r\n“Reckon I could if I tried. What do you want of her?”\r\n\r\n“See that baby there fairly guzzling down the milk, and look at our\r\nbaby here without a spoonful all these days. Don’t you suppose that\r\nold mother burro has more than that little fellow really needs in his\r\nbusiness? Anyway, if he had to go a little short he could make it up on\r\ngrass.”\r\n\r\n“O--oh!” ejaculated the boy, “burro’s milk? Why, Marian, it wouldn’t be\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my dear child, burro’s milk is a regular article of commerce\r\nin some places, just as cow’s and goat’s milk is in others.”\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” reflected Delbert, “if we didn’t tell him, Davie wouldn’t\r\nknow but what it was all right. Milk is milk to him; he wouldn’t care.”\r\n\r\n“Of course not,” said Marian briskly; “you older children might object\r\nto it, but it won’t make any difference to him whether he shares with\r\na baby burro or a baby calf. You just get a good loop over her head,\r\nand we’ll try this thing out.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GETTING A LOOP OVER THE MOTHER’S HEAD WAS THE EASIEST\r\nPART OF THE BUSINESS]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, getting a loop over the mother’s head was the\r\neasiest part of the business. Delbert soon accomplished that, but Madam\r\nBurro had no intention whatever of standing still and being milked.\r\nIndeed, she developed quite surprising activity, and it was only after\r\nat least an hour of patient labor that Marian was able to secure a few\r\nspoonfuls of milk in the tin cup which the little girls brought down\r\nfrom the Cave.\r\n\r\n“Now, then,” said Marian, “the thing we have got to do is to secure the\r\nbaby. If we keep him tied here, his mother will stay around, and we\r\ncan try her again in the morning. But if he is turned loose with her,\r\nwe may not be able to get near them again.”\r\n\r\n“But we have only one rope, and if I take it off her she will take him\r\nright away now,” said Delbert. “Let’s keep her tied up, I should say.”\r\n\r\n“Well, tie her up till morning. Then we can think of some other way to\r\ndo. It will not do to keep her tied all the time, for then we should\r\nhave to feed her.”\r\n\r\nAs they ate supper they discussed ways and means. They could make\r\npalm-leaf ropes that would do very well to tie the little one with,\r\nbut that did not seem to be as convenient as Marian wanted. Finally\r\nthey decided to make a little corral to keep the baby in. Then he\r\ncould nibble at weeds and grass and could not reach his mother except\r\nwhen Marian chose, and she could thus have a better chance to secure a\r\nration for Davie. The corral would have to be pretty solid and secure,\r\nshe thought, or the old burro might tear it down; still, it would\r\nnot have to be quite as compact as the fence that had been built at\r\nHigh-Tide Pool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACKIE]\r\n\r\nThey went to work at it the next morning. A little of the old stone\r\nwall was still solid enough to serve, but most of it was badly tumbled\r\ndown, and they could not seem to do much at building it up again. The\r\nbanana-patch could be used as one side,--it was so thick nothing would\r\ntry to go through it,--and a couple of palms could be utilized as\r\nfence-posts. There were several nondescript bushes that could be worked\r\nin too. The banana stalks they had already cut down could be used as\r\nbuilding-material, and more could be cut. They were soft and thornless,\r\nwhich was an advantage; also every stalk they cut out improved the\r\npatch by giving those remaining a better chance to grow and mature\r\nfruit. The hatchet was getting pretty dull, but Marian managed to hack\r\noff a number of slender stakes, which she set in the ground in pairs\r\njust far enough apart to lay a banana stalk in between; and these\r\nstalks all averaged about the same size and were piled one above the\r\nother to the top of the stakes, which were then tied together with\r\nbanana-leaf stems.\r\n\r\nThe old pile of poles was overhauled. Part of them were so worm-eaten\r\nthat they fell apart in Marian’s hands, but some were of a different\r\nkind of wood and were still solid. These were built into the fence as\r\nchildren build corncob houses, and Marian was only sorry there were so\r\nfew of them. For part of it they used brush, but that was not so easily\r\nhandled as the bananas or poles because of the thorns. The corral was\r\nnot finished in one day nor in two, and when it was finished it showed\r\nhalf a dozen styles of fence-pattern and had no particular shape, but\r\nwas, nevertheless, very satisfactory, as it would hold the little one\r\nin and keep the old one out.\r\n\r\nThe little burro was easily driven into it, and then the old one was\r\nturned loose. She grazed about during the day, and when milking-time\r\ncame Delbert could easily lasso her. Then, with much labor and great\r\ntying of legs and an abundance of help from the children in holding of\r\nthe same, Marian would get Davie’s little portion of milk. Then the\r\nfour-legged baby was allowed to have what remained, after which he was\r\nengineered back into the corral.\r\n\r\nIn the morning the same performance was gone through. During the day\r\nthe mother and baby could rub noses through that part of the corral\r\nthat had been made of poles, and in the course of time they both became\r\nso tame that the little one was a pet and a playmate for the children\r\nand the old one offered but little objection to sharing with Davie, who\r\nused to sit on the top rail of the fence and watch the milking with\r\nwide eyes that let no detail of the performance escape him.\r\n\r\nHe was very generous, too, considering the small amount of milk he\r\nreceived, and would offer to share with the others; they would all\r\ntake a sip, even Marian, to encourage his unselfish impulses, and, as\r\nDelbert said, for politeness’ sake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nBONANZA COVE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was about the time that the corral was finished that they came to\r\nrealize that they had lost count of the days and really did not know\r\nhow long they had been on the Island. They had even lost track of the\r\nday of the week, and Marion did not know when she had ever done that\r\nin her life before. She and Delbert sat down and figured and figured,\r\ntrying to count back and remember what had been done on each day; but\r\nit was no use, it had been too long. Jennie, however, was quite sure\r\nthat it was Wednesday then, though she could not tell why,--she just\r\nthought it was, that was all,--and so, assuming that she was correct in\r\nher belief, Marian easily figured up what day of the month it was then,\r\nfor of course she knew the day and date upon which they had left home.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she said, “we will not trust to our memories any more. Every day\r\nI will put a notch in a stick,”--which she faithfully did, using for\r\nthe purpose a smooth stick that Delbert picked up on the beach one day.\r\nAs a matter of fact, Jennie had been mistaken and they were two days\r\nahead of time, but they did not know that till afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe days were filled pretty full. Marian thought that the busier they\r\nwere, the less would they be a prey to loneliness and homesickness.\r\nThey tumbled out of the Cave mornings, milked the burro, got breakfast,\r\nand then worked awhile at something till it was time for a big sea bath.\r\n\r\nWhen they first began their life on the Island, Delbert was the only\r\none who could swim to amount to anything. Clarence had taught him, and\r\nhe had been a very apt pupil; but the others knew so little of the\r\nuseful art that Marian herself dared not venture beyond her depth,\r\nwhile the little girls declined water that was more than knee-deep and\r\nDavie preferred it even less than that. But already there was a vast\r\nimprovement among them all. As the way to learn to walk is to get up\r\nand walk, so the way to learn to swim is to strike out and swim, and\r\nthey were following that method.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner there were walks to take, little coves to examine, or\r\nropes to braid. Marian watched over the children with eyes of a most\r\njealous, brooding love. Never had they seemed so dear to her, never so\r\nsweet and precious. She was constantly thinking up things to amuse as\r\nwell as benefit them. Of course, she could not perform impossibilities,\r\nand there were some doleful days. There was one perfectly awful day\r\nwhen she found Jennie huddled down behind a rock, crying for her\r\nmother. And Delbert would sit for an hour at a time on Lookout Rock,\r\ngazing out over the water, so wistful and disconsolate that it made\r\nMarian’s throat choke up just to see him, and she would rack her brain\r\nfor some interesting thing to set him at to keep him busy.\r\n\r\nBut it is only fair to say that the doleful spots came far less often\r\nthan one would have supposed they would. Marian was always steadfast in\r\nher assurance that some one would find them some day. They would take\r\ngood care of each other and be as happy as they could till some one\r\nshould come and take them back to the Port. And she herself always kept\r\na cheerful face. Her loving voice and sunny smile, her merry little\r\nways, inspired confidence. As much as possible she made it appear that\r\na desert-island experience was a very desirable thing to have happen\r\nto one. She twisted things till they looked like a joke, and in the\r\nprocess often found herself growing as light-hearted as she wanted the\r\nchildren to be.\r\n\r\nThe bill of fare was limited, to be sure, but they brought to it\r\nappetites sharpened by the constant exercise they were taking in the\r\nsea air and the sunshine.\r\n\r\nOne day up in the pasture they ran across a _panal_.[3] This is the\r\nnest of a kind of wild bee and is made of the same material that our\r\nhornets use in constructing their homes, but the bee itself is not so\r\nlarge as a hornet. Marian saw the nest first and pointed it out to the\r\nother children merely as a matter of curiosity, but Delbert straightway\r\nbecame excited.\r\n\r\n  [3] Pronounced _pah-nahlʹ_; plural, _pah-nahʹ-layss_. It is the\r\n      regular Spanish word for honeycomb.\r\n\r\nThere was honey in that bees’ nest; he knew it; splendid honey. Hadn’t\r\nClarence bought some once of an Indian and given him a lot? And\r\nClarence had told him all about _panales_. You take all the outside\r\nhoney and comb away and leave the core, and they will build on again,\r\njust as tame bees will.\r\n\r\nMarian was a little dubious. Honey was all very well, but stings were\r\nnot at all desirable. How were they to proceed to get the sweet store?\r\n\r\n“We have no bee-smoker,” she reminded him, “and if we had, there are no\r\nrags to be burned in it.”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” declared Delbert scornfully, “do you s’pose the Indians have\r\nsmokers?--or rags either? No, sirree! they just build a fire of trash\r\nthey gather up. Besides, the stings of these little bees don’t amount\r\nto shucks!”\r\n\r\nIt was not in Marian’s policy to discourage him from doing anything not\r\nactually dangerous to life and limb, and she was glad he was willing\r\nto dare the stings; so she said they would go back to the Cave for the\r\nlittle dishpan and some coals to start a smudge with, and see what they\r\ncould do.\r\n\r\nThe younger children were to keep back out of the danger zone,--which\r\nthey were very willing to do, for they did not share Delbert’s\r\noptimism about the trifling nature of wild-bee stings,--and she and\r\nDelbert swathed their hands and faces as well as they could and still\r\nbe able to work handily. They built three little fires about the bush\r\nthe nest was in, and gathered trash and piled it on till they were all\r\nsmoking finely. With a forked pole Marian raked one of them as nearly\r\nunder the nest as she could, and then, holding her skirts carefully so\r\nthat they should not swing into the fire, she began the task of robbing\r\nthe little bees.\r\n\r\nDelbert held the pan, and she cut off layer after layer of the\r\npaper-like comb filled with the clear sweet liquid, but she was careful\r\nto leave a goodly portion at the center for the bees to begin on anew.\r\nThen they retreated with their booty, threw a towel over it, and gave\r\nit to Jennie and Esther to carry off, while they raked back and stamped\r\nout the fires and threw dirt over the ashes, so that they could not\r\nstart up again.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole performance both of them had received stings, but, as\r\nDelbert said, they did not amount to much, and certainly honey never\r\ntasted sweeter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TASK OF ROBBING THE LITTLE BEES]\r\n\r\nFrom then on the children’s eyes were always open for _panales_. They\r\nfound two small nests that they decided to let alone till they were\r\nlarger, and about a week later they found one down near the shore that\r\nyielded even more honey than the first. They got several stings, too,\r\nand Marian smiled grimly as she reflected how necessity was teaching\r\nthem hardihood.\r\n\r\nThat was the day they discovered the riches of Bonanza Cove.\r\n\r\nThey had never gone down into it before, having always skirted it quite\r\na way up on the hill, for there was no sand at that part, only ragged\r\nrocks with broken shells and barnacles, interspersed with occasional\r\nclumps of mango bushes,--certainly not easy ground for little feet to\r\nrun over. But this day, as they were returning home with the little\r\ndishpan of luscious sweetness, Esther had declared, “I see a bottle”;\r\nand on the strength of that declaration they climbed down into the\r\ncove, for a bottle would be a very valuable thing to have. And, once\r\nthere, they found so many valuable things that they gathered up a load\r\nand carried it home and went back in the afternoon for more.\r\n\r\nThe bottle proved to be a quart beer-bottle that some one had doubtless\r\ntossed, corked but empty, over some steamer’s side, and careful search\r\nrevealed six others, besides the remains of several that had been\r\nbroken. Marian hailed them with delight. Now they could carry water in\r\nbottles when they went exploring, and leave her precious glass jar safe\r\nat the Cave. She had always been afraid it would get broken on some of\r\nthose trips. Five of the seven bottles were only pints, but were none\r\nthe less eagerly welcomed and treasured.\r\n\r\nAlso there was discovered in a clump of mango bushes, half buried in\r\nthe mud, an old broken five-gallon demijohn. The basketwork enclosing\r\nit was nearly intact, and Marian thought they might use it for\r\nsomething some time.\r\n\r\nThe wreck of an old barrel was also rescued from the mud. Only three of\r\nits staves were gone. Who knew what might not some time be done with\r\nwhat remained? Several rusty tin cans were acquired. Marian could mend\r\nthem by drawing a tiny rag through the holes in them; and Esther came\r\nup with a piece of scrap iron that might be made into a spear-head if\r\na body only knew how; Delbert knew Clarence could have done it all\r\nright. They found three little boards, too, and an old shoe whose top\r\nwas not yet stiff. Besides all this, there were innumerable armloads\r\nof driftwood. They gathered it up into piles beyond the reach of high\r\ntides.\r\n\r\nBut the most exciting discovery of all was the remains of an old canoe.\r\nOne side and a goodly portion of the bottom were gone, but it was\r\nundeniably a canoe. It had been tossed up on the rocks by some storm\r\nand had lain bleaching in the sun ever since. Nothing would do but\r\nDelbert must get that old fragment into the water. They all caught his\r\nenthusiasm and worked with a will.\r\n\r\nThe canoe was of native manufacture, having been hollowed out from\r\none big log, and what was left of it seemed to be quite solid. After\r\nthey had it floating they hunted up poles and practiced the art of\r\nnavigation for a while. It was a clumsy thing, and of course everybody\r\nconnected with it got wet, but already Delbert had visions of what it\r\nmight lead to.\r\n\r\n“Marian,” he said, “let’s pile a lot of that wood on this and take it\r\naround that way. It will be a lot easier than carrying it over.”\r\n\r\n“The waves are too high,” she objected, “and we should have to tie the\r\nwood on good and solid, for the way this thing dips and tips and turns\r\nit would all be off before we were out of the cove.”\r\n\r\n“The waves are high,” he conceded, “and, of course, we should have to\r\ntie the wood on. This thing won’t stay anywhere. What’s left of it\r\nknows it used to be the side and it doesn’t understand that it is the\r\nbottom now.”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you,” she said; “let’s wait till to-morrow. Maybe the wind\r\nwill not pile the waves quite so high then, and we can tie your rope\r\nto it. See there is the hole in the prow they made to moor it by, and\r\nwe can tow it round, if you like. That is splendid wood and it will\r\ncertainly be easier getting it home that way than carrying it up over\r\nthe hill.”\r\n\r\nBut Delbert was not quite satisfied.\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you,” he said; “if we can get it around the point there, we\r\ncan take it the other way, in back of the Island. It’s a lot longer\r\nway, but there are no breakers in there.”\r\n\r\n“I guess we could do it that way all right. So let’s go back now and\r\nbraid palm-leaf ropes the rest of to-day, so as to have plenty to tie\r\nthe wood with, and hunt up some nice poles and paddles; and to-morrow\r\nearly we will come and take this gallant bark round into harbor.”\r\n\r\nSo they beached it again, and piled stones in it so it could not get\r\naway, and then went back to the home end of the Island.\r\n\r\nMexicans make a very good rope of twisted palm-leaves, but our\r\nislanders had not learned how yet, and so braided them instead, for\r\neven the children could do that. For a large rope they simply took\r\nthree of the small ones and braided them together. The finished\r\narticles were very knobby, uneven affairs, of course, and could not be\r\nused to lasso with, but they were flexible and strong and served to tie\r\nthings. They had quite a number of these ropes of home manufacture.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, after attending to the burro and eating a breakfast of\r\nfish baked in the hot coals, they filled the two big bottles and three\r\nof the little ones with water, tied stout little palm-leaf strings to\r\nthem, so that each person could easily carry one, and started out with\r\ntheir ropes and poles.\r\n\r\nMarian had Mr. Cunningham’s pail with more fish for their dinner, and\r\nthe hatchet also, and Davie as usual flourished the dig-spoon. He soon\r\ngot tired of carrying his bottle of water and passed it over to Marian,\r\nwho put it into the pail.\r\n\r\nAt the cove they put the pail and their bottles into a clump of mango\r\nbushes and began to gather up the best and biggest of the wood. Marian\r\nmade compact bundles of it and lashed them as best she could to what\r\nremained of the old canoe. Alone it would not stay in any position\r\nthat made it navigable, but reinforced by the bundles of wood on what\r\nDelbert called the “absent” side of the craft, it floated as any\r\nother mass of wooden wreckage would have floated and maintained an\r\nequilibrium which allowed the children to perch on top in safety.\r\n\r\nDelbert scratched his head.\r\n\r\n“This isn’t a canoe and it isn’t a raft. What in creation is it,\r\nanyway, Marian?”\r\n\r\n“I reckon it’s a float,” she answered.\r\n\r\nSo, after the pail had been placed on the safest spot, where it would\r\nnot get water splashed into it, and after Jennie had received explicit\r\ninstructions to watch over it, the voyage began. They had taken the\r\nprecaution to put on their bathing-suits and expected to do as much\r\nwading and swimming as anything else.\r\n\r\nMarian knew a good deal about rowing and sailing a boat, but this was a\r\ndifferent matter. To begin with, they had only one really good pole.\r\nThe other was too short, besides being crooked, and their craft swung\r\nround and twisted and did its best to wobble its way back to the beach.\r\nAt last, however, they got out quite a way, beyond the depth of the\r\nshortest pole, but when they came to round the point there was trouble\r\nagain. Finally Marian jumped off and, half swimming, half wading to\r\nshore with the lariat, towed them round the point; and then, because\r\nthey made better progress that way, accomplished most of the rest of\r\nthe journey so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VOYAGE BEGAN]\r\n\r\nDavie also preferred to do most of his traveling on his own feet, and\r\nMarian did not blame him, for the float did not even look like a safe\r\ncraft, and the way it wobbled and bobbed might well have made an older\r\npassenger than Davie uneasy. So he trudged on, mostly in the edge of\r\nthe water, now and then whimpering when he hurt his bare toes and again\r\nlaughing gleefully at some treasure of the sea which the fates cast at\r\nhis feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIAN TOWED THEM ROUND THE POINT]\r\n\r\nAt some places it was not convenient to tow the float, and then they\r\nresorted to poling altogether. At one or two points Delbert took the\r\nrope and swam across to a better place for pulling. And several times\r\nthe bundles of wood became loosened, and all hands had to retire to\r\nshore till Marian could get them satisfactorily retied.\r\n\r\nAltogether, their progress was so slow that the day was nearly done\r\nbefore they moored their gallant craft to the little rock pier behind\r\nthe Island.\r\n\r\nNext day they tried it another way. They took all the wood off and\r\nallowed the old fragment to turn turtle. That did a great deal better\r\nin some ways, but it was a little difficult to get aboard of it. Once\r\nthey were aboard, however, it sustained the weight of them all well\r\nenough, though, of course, there was no freeboard at all, and, while it\r\nwas willing to remain in that position, the ends of the canoe, being\r\nwell under water, offered considerable resistance and made it more\r\ndifficult to pole than a boat or raft would have been.\r\n\r\nJennie thought Marian had better cut off those ragged ends and leave\r\nonly the smooth side, but Marian was not anxious to attempt such a\r\ntask as that with only a dull hatchet and a few knives to work with.\r\nBesides, she was not sure at all but she would some day want those ends\r\nright where they were. She could not think of any way of improving it,\r\nand even as it was it enlarged the horizon of their daily lives.\r\n\r\nThe prow being under water, they could not very well use the hole\r\nin it to tie the rope to, but at one place in the bottom there was\r\na knothole, and Marian firmly wedged a stick into that. With a rope\r\nfastened to this stick they could tie the canoe where it would float\r\nout quite a little distance from shore, and then they could swim out to\r\nit. She soon found her little flock were improving in their swimming\r\nlessons. With the old canoe at hand it did not matter so much if one\r\ndid get beyond one’s depth a little; it gave one security.\r\n\r\nThen pretty soon, when they began to get the knack of making the old\r\nthing move along in the water where they wanted it to, they would go\r\nout to the little sandbars and reefs that had before been beyond their\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nSome of these had mango bushes where a certain variety of small oyster\r\nattached themselves to the stems and rocks, where they could be easily\r\ngathered at low tide. One had an outcropping of rock in one place which\r\nhad several basin-like depressions, which Marian cleaned out and made\r\nuse of. She would boil down sea-water in her kettle, till it was about\r\na saturated solution, and then put it into the demijohn, and when\r\nthat was full would take it over and empty it into those shallow rock\r\nbasins, where the sun evaporated it till nothing was left but the salt.\r\n\r\nClose on the heels of the food problem had come that of clothing.\r\nMarian thanked her stars that the soil of the Island was sandy and\r\nbrushed off easily, but even with that in their favor they had not been\r\non the Island so very long before their clothing sadly needed washing.\r\nShe put her whole flock into their bathing-suits and washed everything\r\nelse. But that made such inroads on her lone cake of soap that she\r\ndecided things must do without soap in the future, and what dirt would\r\nnot come out with water and sunshine would have to stay in. That went\r\nsorely against the grain, for Mrs. Hadley was a notoriously neat and\r\nclean woman and had trained her daughter in her own spick-and-span\r\nways; but it could not be helped.\r\n\r\nBefore long it became plain that the question of washing was not\r\nall there was to it either. Clothes constantly worn will in time\r\nwear out, and Marian’s little flock soon became shabby as well as\r\ndingy. She staved off the evil day for a while by decreeing that the\r\nbathing-suits must be worn all the time, and so the other clothes were\r\nfolded away up at the Cave, to await the blest day when some one should\r\nwander into San Moros and take them all back to the Port.\r\n\r\nThe children were willing enough. It did away with the need of dressing\r\nand undressing, for they had so little bedding that Marian let them\r\nsleep in their suits too. Davie could not see any use in clothes\r\nanyway, except when he was cold. Before long he rebelled against even\r\nthe little bathing-suit, and as there was no one to see and criticize,\r\nhis sister let him run from morning till night absolutely naked. He was\r\nso fat and dimpled and sweet that the other children liked him best\r\nthat way, and his little body became so tanned that Marian called him a\r\nlittle Indian, and because he strutted about in such a lordly way she\r\ndubbed him Hiawatha. That tickled Delbert, who then tied his little\r\nbrother’s hair in tufts and stuck them full of feathers.\r\n\r\nDelbert himself began to need the barber’s services, but when Jennie\r\ntold him so one day he declared he was not going to have his hair cut,\r\nhe was going to let it grow long and make fishlines of it.\r\n\r\n“You’ll look fine,” said she, scornfully; “a boy with pigtails; you’d\r\nbetter cut it, Marian.”\r\n\r\nBut Marian, with a mental vision of how fine he would look after she\r\nhad barbered him with the buttonhole scissors, decided in favor of\r\npigtails.\r\n\r\nSo Delbert tied a string about his forehead, stuck feathers in it, and\r\ndemanded an Indian name. Marian named him Chingachgook. Of course the\r\nlittle girls wanted Indian names too, so she told Jennie she could be\r\nWahtawah and Esther Pocahontas.\r\n\r\nThey were very much pleased and went straightway to hunt up some\r\nfeathers, though Delbert declared that squaws never wore them.\r\n\r\n“Never mind,” said Marian soothingly, “these squaws can do anything\r\nthey have a mind to.”\r\n\r\nShe herself did not adopt a name, but Delbert used to call her the\r\ngreat squaw chief.\r\n\r\nAs for shelter, they never found on the Island a better place than that\r\nwhich they had fortunately secured the first night. The bat cave near\r\nthe water’s edge was the only other cave of any considerable size, and\r\nnothing else would have afforded any security whatever from a storm.\r\nWhenever it was convenient, Marian reinforced the brush shade in front\r\nof the Cave. She had it good and thick now, but of course it would\r\nnot have turned a rain. The nights were getting cooler, and she cast\r\nabout for ways and means of getting more bedding. She pounded sticks\r\nand dried banana leaves into the Cave where it ran back and became\r\ntoo narrow for their feet. She blocked up the sides with rocks and\r\npieces of driftwood and filled in the chinks with little wads of banana\r\nleaves, so that the wind was shut out better. She saved the feathers\r\nfrom the birds they killed, and tied them up in the little girls’\r\npetticoats for pillows, and she saved every rabbit-skin and stretched\r\nit out so that it dried smoothly, scraping it as clean as she could,\r\nand when it was almost dry, rubbed and worked it till it was soft and\r\npliable. This, of course, was not the same as having them tanned, but\r\nshe did not know how to tan leather, much as she wished she did.\r\n\r\nAfter she had learned how to keep herself supplied with salt, she used\r\nto rub that on the fresh skins when she stretched them out to dry,\r\nbelieving that was one good step toward preserving them. When she had\r\nquite a number all finished up in this manner, she trimmed the edges a\r\nlittle and sewed them together. In the course of time she would have a\r\nrobe large enough to cover them all, and as long as she could keep it\r\ndry it would not spoil.\r\n\r\nDelbert was interested in bows and arrows. His first efforts at making\r\nbows were not startling successes, by any means, and he soon turned\r\nthem over to Wahtawah and Pocahontas and tried for better ones for\r\nhimself. At first he used any and every kind of a straight smooth\r\nstick he ran across, and it seemed almost impossible to find any that\r\ncombined the necessary straightness and strength, but when he finally\r\ncaught the idea of making them of palm-leaf stems, which are very tough\r\nand strong, he evolved one that would actually shoot quite effectively.\r\n\r\nThen his sisters straightway clamored for good bows also, and he must\r\nneeds make for them too. He was at first a little scornful, but Marian\r\nadvised that he arm them as well as possible, for while the chances\r\nof their bagging any game were slim in any case, there was simply no\r\nchance at all with bows that were only toys. Bowstrings were made from\r\nMarian’s hair, but arrow-points were a puzzling problem. The boys at\r\nthe Port had tipped their arrows with heavy wire, but wire was not an\r\nIsland commodity. Marian suggested bone, and a few were made of that\r\nmaterial, but it was so very hard to work, and the knives needed so\r\nmuch whetting, that they were constantly on the lookout for something\r\neasier. Finally they learned to make them of wood hardened in the fire.\r\n\r\nThe first bows made were now Davie’s property, and he was so reckless\r\nwith his shooting that Marian forbade points of any description being\r\nput on his arrows. He did not seem to mind the omission,--he never hit\r\nanything except by accident, and then it was usually one of the other\r\nchildren, and they were all careful not to call his attention to the\r\nfact that his arrows were all blunt.\r\n\r\nDavie was the only one who was not at times more or less depressed by\r\ntheir situation. He was so little, and had now been separated from\r\nhis mother so long, that he never fretted for her. Marian had always\r\ntaken the most of the care of him anyway, so as long as she was there\r\nto do it he considered that conditions were normal. He found life\r\nvery interesting and satisfactory and felt no need of more extensive\r\nsociety. His comical baby ways were closely watched and intensely\r\nenjoyed by the other children, who loved him dearly, and they would\r\neagerly report to Marian everything funny he did when she was not\r\npresent. Even when he was naughty, which he occasionally was, they were\r\nrather apt to overlook it and laugh at the funny spectacle he made of\r\nhimself. Delbert, though, would get provoked sometimes.\r\n\r\nOne trick the little fellow had when His Majesty was displeased was to\r\nhide the whetstone. This was a stone which he himself had picked up\r\nout on one of the salt reefs. It was a little different from any other\r\nthat they had found and was splendid to sharpen the knives and hatchet\r\nwith. Delbert used to make quite an ado over borrowing it from Davie,\r\nbecause it pleased him so to have something apparently so valuable to\r\nlend. Marian, too, was careful to say, “Please lend me your whetstone,\r\nDavie,” before she rubbed her knife over it, and as a rule he would\r\nbeamingly give permission. That and the dig-spoon were about the only\r\nthings that were considered especially his, and as it was not often\r\nthat any one else used the dig-spoon, he did not bother much about it;\r\nbut when he felt naughty he would conceal the little stone and refuse\r\nto reveal its whereabouts.\r\n\r\nSometimes Delbert would use some other stone then, or he would coolly\r\nwait until Davie got over his pouts and brought forth the good one, or\r\nelse he would slyly hunt it up and use it without Davie’s knowledge,\r\ncarefully replacing it when he had finished.\r\n\r\nBut one day he could not find it, and Davie simply would not get it.\r\nMarian herself wanted it too, but Davie resisted even her coaxing.\r\nDelbert lost all patience, and Marian began to wonder on the second day\r\nif some measure more strenuous than common might not be needed. She\r\nbegan to think that perhaps the child himself did not know where it\r\nwas; it might possibly be that he had lost it instead of hiding it. He\r\nwas so little and his speech was so limited as yet that she did not\r\nalways feel sure that she understood him perfectly. Perhaps he simply\r\ndid not want to admit that he had not been bright enough to keep track\r\nof the valuable thing himself. But then Esther saw him playing with the\r\nstone off by himself. When she ran to tell Marian, however, he hid it\r\nagain and only smiled impishly at their requests.\r\n\r\nNo, he was simply being naughty, and, what was worse, was staying\r\nnaughty; so after a little Marian issued her verdict.\r\n\r\n“I won’t punish him, though I could probably make him get it by\r\nspanking him, but mother never did that to him, and I will not till I\r\nreally have to, but the next time any of you see that whetstone you may\r\ntake it from him and I will confiscate it and it won’t be his stone any\r\nmore.”\r\n\r\n“But,” said Jennie dubiously, “it _is_ his stone; he found it, Marian.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” returned her sister, “and if it were some less\r\nnecessary thing I would say he had a right to do as he chose with it,\r\nbut a whetstone is something we all need. I need it to sharpen the\r\nhatchet with; nothing else I can find does so well. Delbert needs it\r\nright now to sharpen his knife, so he can work out that bone arrowhead.\r\nIt is to Davie’s interest as well as ours that the hatchet and knives\r\nshould be sharp, only he is so little he can’t realize it. Just because\r\nhe saw the stone first does not give him a right to hide it away and\r\nrefuse to let us use it, when we all need the use of it and there is\r\nnot another one like it that we know of.”\r\n\r\nShe explained this all as well as she could to Davie, but he remained\r\nobdurate. They set themselves to work, therefore, to ferret out the\r\nmuch-needed implement, and before long Delbert found it and brought it\r\nin triumph to Marian, who took possession of it amid Davie’s loud wails.\r\n\r\nHis crying availed him nothing, however; the stone was put in a cleft\r\nof the rock where only Marian and Delbert could reach it, and the\r\nyoung would-be monopolist finally decided that it was not worth crying\r\nfor, and, smoothing out his face, trotted about his affairs as sweetly\r\nimportant as ever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE EGG ISLANDS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was now growing close to that time so dear to children’s\r\nhearts,--and grown people’s, too, for that matter,--namely, Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe Hadleys had always made much of it, and, hampered as she was,\r\nMarian determined to celebrate in some manner. She had had to let\r\nThanksgiving go by unnoticed, for the especial rite of that day is a\r\nloaded dinner-table, and she had bowed to the inevitable, but, though\r\ngood dinners are in order of a Christmas Day, they are not the entire\r\nprogramme, and Marian’s fertile brain grew busy.\r\n\r\nIn her workbag was the roll of fine lawn of which she had been making\r\nhandkerchiefs. One was partly made, and with careful planning there was\r\nenough material to make three more, leaving a few little scraps. In\r\noff moments, when the children were engaged in making love to the baby\r\nburro or busy at play on the beach, she hemmed the handkerchiefs, and\r\nthen with her colored silks outlined Mother Goose pictures on them and\r\nwrote the children’s names in the corners. So far, so good.\r\n\r\nThen she constructed three little dolls, each doll being made of one\r\nstraight bone with a knob at one end that would do for the head, with a\r\nwishbone tied below to make the arms. One doll had wishbone legs too,\r\nbut that exhausted the supply of wishbones, and the other two had to\r\nbe content with legs that were not so nicely matched. Faces and hair\r\nshe made with the lead-pencil, and little suits of underwear from the\r\nscraps of lawn, and she cut a piece out of the ruffle of her colored\r\npetticoat for the dresses and three cunning little sunbonnets. For\r\nDelbert she whittled out a little boat about three inches long and\r\nrigged it out with silken ropes and a lawn sail.\r\n\r\nOn Christmas Eve she gathered them about her in front of their fire up\r\nby the Cave, and told them Christmas stories till they were sleepy,\r\nand, to their glee, had them hang up their stockings before they\r\ncrawled into the Cave and cuddled into bed.\r\n\r\nSomewhat to her surprise, they insisted that she hang up her stocking\r\ntoo, which she did, wondering much what they had planned to surprise\r\nher with, for she knew now, by their dancing eyes and loving voices,\r\nthat they had planned something, though she had not noticed anything\r\nmysterious in their behavior before.\r\n\r\nIn the morning she was careful to go down to the well for a pail\r\nof water the first thing, so as to give them a chance to fill her\r\nstocking, and, sure enough, upon her return she found it full to\r\noverflowing.\r\n\r\nIt seemed that for several weeks back Delbert and the little girls had\r\nbeen saving every pretty shell and feather they found for this purpose\r\nand they had accumulated a large assortment.\r\n\r\nShells, feathers, crabs’ claws and seaweed,--how sharp their bright\r\neyes had been to spy out every pretty thing they passed! How\r\nindustriously the little hands had gathered!\r\n\r\nMarian’s heart swelled. How she praised that collection! And\r\nstraightway after breakfast she hunted up a nice, safe, dry little\r\ncleft in the rock, a sort of a baby cave, where she arranged them all,\r\nsorting the feathers and tying them in bunches, and when all was in\r\norder fitted one of the little boards they had found in the cove in\r\nfront for a door, so nothing should disturb the treasures.\r\n\r\nThat morning, out on one of the salt reefs, they found a log in among\r\nthe mango bushes, where it had hitherto lain unseen. Marian judged that\r\nit had been tossed there by the storm the night of their arrival, for\r\nit did not appear to have lain there so very long.\r\n\r\nOf course, they worked and tugged till they had it in the water, and it\r\nwas so much of an improvement over the old canoe that they straightway\r\ndiscarded that,--Marian later working it into the corral,--and every\r\nday they went out on the log.\r\n\r\nIt floated in shallower water than the canoe and was easily poled or\r\npaddled wherever they wished to go, but it had two drawbacks; first,\r\nit had nothing to which the rope could be tied to moor it,--but that\r\nreally did not matter much for they could roll it up on the beach out\r\nof reach of the water; but for the second, it was so round and smooth\r\nthat it was forever rolling over and spilling some one off into the\r\nwater, and this drawback simply had to be put up with.\r\n\r\nOne morning, down in the cove, Delbert found a small watermelon.\r\nProbably it had been lost overboard from some steamer passing by out\r\nin the Gulf, for it was many a long league to where such things were\r\ngrown, yet in any case it seemed a wonderful thing that, with all that\r\nwaste of tossing water, that little melon, scarce as large as Marian’s\r\nhead, should have drifted into San Moros and then into their cove. It\r\nwas ripe and they ate it, gnawing down the rind to the very outside.\r\nOrdinarily Marian would not have allowed that, but so small a melon\r\ndivided into five pieces did not give a very large piece to each one,\r\nand they were hungry for something besides animal food, and had not\r\nfound a really _good_ bunch of bananas yet.\r\n\r\nThey saved the seeds of the melon and decided to plant a patch with\r\nthem, though they hoped to be rescued long before they could eat of the\r\nfruits of their labor. To plant the patch would give them something new\r\nto do, and perhaps some one else would be benefited by the crop even if\r\nthey were not.\r\n\r\nMarian had never been much of a gardener, but she thought the long,\r\nlow, sandy point would be a good place to plant, for by digging down a\r\nlittle there they would reach soil that was always damp with the fresh\r\nwater underneath; so the garden would not need irrigation, and she had\r\nheard some one say that sandy soil was good for melons.\r\n\r\nDelbert remembered reading in his history that the North American\r\nIndians used to put a fish in each hill of corn for fertilizer, and he\r\nwanted to try it. But fish were not so easily secured as to warrant\r\nthat; they were growing scarce in High-Tide Pool, and in other places\r\nthey were not very hungry somehow, and it was rare, indeed, when\r\nDelbert could manage to spear one with his one-pronged spear.\r\n\r\nHowever, the traps were gathering in rabbits pretty frequently, and\r\nthe discarded portions of these could be used instead. So they planted\r\ntheir melon-patch, digging holes down to the damp soil and planting the\r\nseeds in the bottoms with a little fertilizer near. Marian saved half\r\nthe seeds in case the planting should not prosper and should have to be\r\ndone over again.\r\n\r\nWhen they had finished that labor and were proudly viewing their neat\r\nrows of melon holes, Delbert suddenly exclaimed, “Say, Marian! I bet I\r\nknow where we could get some more vegetable seeds.”\r\n\r\n“For pity’s sake, where?”\r\n\r\n“In my coat pocket. Don’t you remember when Bobbie’s father sent off\r\nfor seeds, and they were so long in coming, and the rats had got to ’em\r\nsomewhere on the road and chewed holes in the papers, and the seeds\r\nwere all spilling out? Well, I helped Bobbie carry them home from the\r\noffice, and we put them in our coat pockets, some of them, and I’ll bet\r\nthere are some of those seeds in my pockets yet.”\r\n\r\nStraight they went to the Cave and turned every pocket wrong side out\r\nover a white cloth and with miserly care saved every tiny seed that\r\nfell. There was in all nearly a teaspoonful. Marian separated them,\r\nputting each kind in a clamshell by itself.\r\n\r\nThere were seven kinds. One was peas; there were just three of them.\r\nThey were not sure of the others, though Jennie rather thought one kind\r\nwas eggplant, and Marian was pretty sure another was onions.\r\n\r\nDown in a corner by the bananas was the place chosen for this second\r\nplanting. They built a fence around it, a rather frail affair, but\r\nspecially designed to keep out rabbits, and they sprinkled the beds\r\ntwice a day. All three of the peas sprouted, but something ate them\r\nup. What Marian had thought was onions never came up at all, but the\r\nremaining five kinds all sprouted and grew well, and though their ranks\r\nwere diminished by various bugs and birds,--for Marian could not be on\r\nguard every minute of the time,--there were a few plants of each kind\r\nthat survived all accidents.\r\n\r\nJennie’s eggplant turned out to be big sweet peppers; the other plants\r\nproved to be turnip, carrots, lettuce, and--poppies. Delbert could\r\nnever understand about that last, for he was very sure Bobbie’s father\r\nhad sent only for vegetable seeds, but Marian thought Bobbie’s mother\r\nhad probably had something to do with the list of seeds ordered.\r\n\r\nThe melons did best of all. There were so few of the others that Marian\r\nvetoed all eating till the seeds could be gathered, but the melon-patch\r\nproduced abundantly, so that they did not have to worry about seeds,\r\nbut began eating as soon as the centers were pinkish, and only saved\r\nseeds from the best ones that came later.\r\n\r\nBut long before the melons were ripe, their scanty larder had been\r\nreplenished from a totally different direction.\r\n\r\n“Marian,” Delbert had said, “those little white-looking islands away\r\ndown the bay are duck islands. Clarence told me so, and I can see the\r\nducks going to them every day. Wish we could go there; duck eggs are\r\ngood, I tell you.”\r\n\r\nAway down San Moros they could see them, two little islands, mere\r\ntrifles compared with Smugglers’, and so far away that ordinarily\r\nMarian would not have wasted a moment on thoughts of a journey there,\r\nbut eggs, perhaps young ducks, and here were her hungry little crew\r\ngazing wistfully. “Ducks” the children called them, and it was not till\r\nlong afterward that they learned that the birds were really cormorants.\r\nIf they had known this at the time, they might not have been so hungry\r\nfor the eggs, but cormorants’ eggs, like the eggs of other seabirds,\r\nare not uneatable when one is hungry enough, and they are often eaten\r\nby fishermen.\r\n\r\nThe young girl thought and studied and made ropes and looked toward the\r\n“duck islands.” Every morning long lines of birds went out from them to\r\nthe sea; every evening long lines came back.\r\n\r\nOn those two islands thousands of these “ducks” were nesting.\r\n\r\nAll of her charges could swim now; even Davie could help himself a\r\nlittle in the water. If only the log did not turn over in the water so\r\neasily and often! If that could be remedied, Marian thought they might\r\nrisk the voyage. She and Delbert could easily steer the craft now. They\r\nhad picked and chosen among the few poles at their disposal, till they\r\nhad three that seemed pretty good,--one longish one for poling, two\r\nothers that served in a fashion as paddles. Jennie and Esther could use\r\nthem a little.\r\n\r\nThen a full week was spent in cutting down banana plants and fixing\r\nthem in the corral fence so as to release the poles that were in it,\r\nand this was the time too when the old canoe was put into the fence.\r\n\r\nThose big poles, though not nearly so large as the log, were now laid\r\nparallel to it and tightly lashed on, making an extension on each side\r\nthat would prevent the log rolling over, so that, while they could\r\nnot ride on it and keep dry, they could at least ride it in safety.\r\nThey could not now roll the craft up the beach, but it could easily be\r\nmoored by tying a rope to one of the poles. Good ropes were scarce,\r\nthough; it had taken the best ones to lash the queer raft together.\r\n\r\nMarian’s mind was now fully made up for the venture. They started\r\nearly. The old barrel was tied on, also the broken demijohn. Fire\r\nto cook their dinner with was a question. Marian did not want to\r\nrisk taking the matches for fear they would get wet by some unlucky\r\naccident, so she put a quantity of ashes in the barrel and buried some\r\ngood half-burned brands in them. And because they did not know for sure\r\nwhether they would find wood on the “duck islands” or not, they took\r\nalong a little bundle of sticks too. They had learned that the trunks\r\nof the banana plants contain a tough, strong fiber, and they were using\r\nthis for tying, where short strings were wanted.\r\n\r\nTheir breakfast consisted of cold boiled cottontail left over from\r\nsupper and a few small and very inferior bananas. These they ate on\r\nthe raft after they had started, and they drank from the bottles of\r\nwater which had also been put into the old barrel. It was not a very\r\nample meal, and they turned longing eyes on the distant islands. It was\r\ndevoutly to be hoped that food was plenty there.\r\n\r\nThe sea was very smooth; Marian would not have started if it had not\r\nbeen. The raft was easily paddled along, and she soon lost the few\r\nnervous misgivings with which she began the trip, but she also soon\r\ndecided that she would never make it again till she had studied up some\r\nway of putting up a sail. She was quite sure that Clarence would have\r\ndone it, and it did seem as if it would take forever to get across that\r\nstretch of water.\r\n\r\nHowever, they reached their destination before noon, and, drawing\r\ntheir odd craft up on a bit of beach, they took everything ashore and\r\nhunted a good place for a fire. Having found one, they carefully drew\r\nthe embers from their bed of ashes and, with much coaxing and blowing\r\nand pulling of handfuls of dried grass, finally got a little blaze\r\nstarted, and then they hung the kettle over it with water to heat for\r\nthe eggs which they then went to hunt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH THE ROUGH NESTS]\r\n\r\nThey had to climb a little to reach the eggs, but there were certainly\r\nplenty of them when they got there. The ground was covered with the\r\nrough nests,--just a few sticks with no art in the construction,--but\r\nthere were hundreds upon hundreds of them, far beyond the children’s\r\npower to count. There were eggs in all stages of incubation from\r\nfresh-laid to fully hatched, and awkward squabs tumbled about, while\r\nthe air was rent by the discordant cries of the older ones.\r\n\r\nThe unpleasant odor arising was so strong that Jennie sickened\r\nand quickly retreated to the beach below, where the fresh air was\r\nuntainted, but Esther and Davie were undaunted by the noise or the\r\nsmell and remained to be taught the difference between fresh eggs and\r\nstale ones. The eggs were smaller than the ordinary hen’s egg, being\r\nmore slender and pointed, with a pale-blue chalkiness, which was not so\r\napparent in eggs that had been for some time sat upon.\r\n\r\nNeither Delbert nor Marian had seen these islands before or any others\r\nlike them, but Clarence had, and they remembered his teaching and soon\r\nhad all the fresh eggs they could carry away. Delbert also picked out a\r\ncouple of half-grown squabs, whose necks he wrung as soon as he reached\r\nthe beach; and soon they had their kettle full of eggs simmering, while\r\nthe squabs roasted before the fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELBERT PICKED OUT A COUPLE OF HALF-GROWN SQUABS]\r\n\r\nCormorants’ eggs have a slight fishy flavor, but the Hadley appetite\r\ndid not stick at that, nor at the fact that the white does not\r\ncoagulate solid, but remains a quivering jelly of a pale-green color,\r\nthrough which the yellow yolk can be plainly seen. The flavor of the\r\nsquabs, too, might not have been appreciated at Delmonico’s, but\r\nMarian’s company was not so fastidious as some people are. That which\r\ncould be eaten they ate without ado.\r\n\r\nAnd after they had eaten all they wanted, they examined the island.\r\nThere was nothing of importance upon it but the birds and the eggs.\r\nThere was some driftwood, to be sure, which they threw up on the high\r\nbanks out of reach of the tides, in case they might want it some time;\r\nand down on the narrow little beaches the children found great numbers\r\nof little clamshells, from the size of Davie’s little fingernail up\r\nto as large as a quarter, and of various assorted colors, which they\r\ngathered with great enjoyment.\r\n\r\nTheir fire at home having been carefully covered as usual, they did not\r\nneed to take any embers back with them, and so used the ashes to pack\r\neggs in, putting into the barrel and the old demijohn all they thought\r\nthey could use up before they would spoil. It took several trips up\r\nto the nests to get enough, and they took a dozen half-grown squabs\r\nas well. These, with their legs tied together, were also put into the\r\nbarrel, where in spite of all precautions they managed to break quite a\r\nnumber of eggs before they were landed at Smugglers’.\r\n\r\nAs it chanced, they had a tide in their favor on the way home, and\r\nthey arrived in good time. They carried their eggs up to the Cave and\r\nthey picketed the squabs out, tying each one where it could not get\r\nentangled with its neighbors.\r\n\r\nTheir supper consisted of eggs and some quail that had got into the\r\ntraps during their absence, and as they sat about their cozy fire up at\r\nthe Cave, Marian felt that the day had been well spent.\r\n\r\nIt took considerable planning to contrive a sail for the raft. To begin\r\nwith, there was nothing at all suitable for a mast, and, secondly,\r\nthere was nothing suitable for a sail. The hatchet, too, was by this\r\ntime very dull and needed a great deal of sharpening. Delbert said he\r\nhad seen Indian canoes with an oar for a mast and a blanket for a sail,\r\nand they could use a blanket also and perhaps could make shift with a\r\npole of some description in lieu of an oar; but even then it needed\r\nropes, and they had used all theirs in lashing the raft together, and\r\nthere were no more palm-leaves till more should grow. It was then they\r\nresorted to banana fiber entirely. It took considerable time to work it\r\nout nice and clean, but they finally got serviceable ropes of it. With\r\na great deal of bracing and tying of crooked poles, they succeeded at\r\nlast in rigging up a sail that very materially assisted them in making\r\nseveral other trips to the bird islands before the nesting-season was\r\nover.\r\n\r\nBut to carry live coals with them when they went away from the home\r\nisland was a nuisance, and Marian did not want to use the matches\r\nexcept in case of absolute necessity. Besides, there was danger of\r\ngetting them wet if they were taken on the raft, for nothing on that\r\ncraft was sure of not receiving a bath sooner or later on every trip,\r\nand often everything and everybody got ducked several times; even what\r\nwas in the barrel was not always secure.\r\n\r\nThe children wanted Marian to try building a fire with the crystal of\r\nher watch, but she did not want to take that off for fear of getting\r\ndirt in the works.\r\n\r\n“But there are other ways,” she told them. “Our grandparents used to\r\nmake fire with a flint and steel. Let’s watch for flints.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I’ve got a flint now in my pocket,” said Jennie. “Carmelita gave\r\nit to me. She said her father lit his cigarettes with it, but he had\r\nbought him another one.” She produced a bit of stone as big as the end\r\nof her thumb.\r\n\r\nMarian examined it.\r\n\r\n“This is too small,” she said. “It has been used till it is nearly all\r\nchipped away; there is hardly enough of it left to hang on to.”\r\n\r\n“Why won’t any stone do?” asked Jennie, as she pocketed her treasure.\r\n\r\n“I guess because flint is harder than other stone. It has to be hard\r\nenough to shave off a little shaving of steel you know. That is what\r\nthe spark is, a tiny shaving of steel that is afire.”\r\n\r\n“Where’d we get steel?” asked Esther.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the knives are all steel.”\r\n\r\n“And the dig-spoon?”\r\n\r\n“No, that is only iron. It isn’t just the same thing, Pocahontas, and\r\nI’m sure if we keep our eyes open we can find little pieces of flint\r\nthat will do.”\r\n\r\nThat, indeed, was not difficult. They soon had a collection of bits of\r\nflint, some of which, indeed, were actual arrowheads dropped in some\r\nage long gone by.\r\n\r\nThen Marian tried over and over to strike sparks from the bits of flint\r\nand the backs of the knives; sometimes a weak little spark would fly\r\nout only to disappear immediately, and no kindling she could get would\r\nignite. They had seen Mexicans light their cigarettes by this method\r\ntime and again, but the Mexican has a prepared wick which catches the\r\nspark and burns on till it is put out.\r\n\r\nMarian tried to make a wick from strips of rag torn from the towel, but\r\nit was of no avail. She was not very successful in striking a spark in\r\nthe first place, and she never could retain one for a second after it\r\nwas struck.\r\n\r\n“I believe we’ve got to be more primitive still,” she said to Delbert.\r\n“The real wild Indian makes his fire by rubbing two sticks together.”\r\n\r\nSomething distracted her attention then, and she thought no more about\r\nit till Delbert came to her a half-hour later, flushed and tired and\r\ndisgusted.\r\n\r\n“Marian,” he said, “I don’t believe any Indian _ever_ made two sticks\r\nlight by rubbing them together!”\r\n\r\n“Have you been trying it?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Yes, and I’ve rubbed and rubbed and _rubbed_, and they don’t light at\r\nall.” He showed the sticks that he had been rubbing broadside against\r\nbroadside till they were quite nicely polished.\r\n\r\nMarian had to laugh.\r\n\r\n“Dear boy, they don’t do it that way,” she said. “I don’t know that I\r\ncan do it, but I saw it done once. I truly did. Do you remember that\r\nman--I don’t suppose you do, though, you were so little, but he was\r\nuncle to the lady that lived in the white house just across the stream\r\nthere where we lived before Ronald died.”\r\n\r\n“I remember the white house,” said Delbert, “and the lady,--Mrs.\r\nWalton, wasn’t it? She had the funny cats with long hair and she always\r\nhad pink ribbons on their necks.”\r\n\r\n“Angora cats. Yes, I remember she had a couple. Well, her uncle came\r\nto visit her once, and he had been agent or something out on an Indian\r\nreservation, and he knew all kinds of Indian things that the Walton\r\nboys wanted to know, and so he used to tell them about these things,\r\nand I took it all in whenever I was there. He knew how to scalp a dead\r\nenemy, and how to tie a live one to a horse so he couldn’t get away. I\r\nremember those two things distinctly, and he explained about smoking a\r\npeace pipe, and how to tell which way you were going when you got lost,\r\nand also--how to make a fire with two sticks.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I just want you to show me; that’s all!”\r\n\r\n“All right, we’ll try it. That man told just what kind of wood to use,\r\nbut I’ve forgotten that, and probably we couldn’t get the same kind\r\nanyway. I guess this piece will do to begin with, and if it doesn’t\r\nwork we’ll try some other kind. Now, it wants a nice smooth, round\r\nstick. Give me your knife; I can whittle better with it than I can with\r\nthe other one. Let me see, it needs a--where is that broken bottle that\r\nDavie was playing with that just had the rounded bottom left on it?\r\nThat’s it. You see, now, we have this stick about a foot long, and we\r\nsmooth one end off nicely, and we make the other one pointed, then we\r\nmake a little notch in this other stick and down like that. Where is\r\nyour bow? I believe that is too big. Give me Jennie’s and tighten the\r\nstring on it. Now I put this big stick with the notches down where I\r\ncan hold it firm with my foot, so, and take a turn of the bowstring\r\naround the little round stick, so, and--give me that piece of bottle--I\r\nput it over the top end of the round stick so it can revolve smoothly,\r\nwhich it could not do in the palm of my hand,--at least, not without\r\nwearing my hand out,--and I fit the pointed end into the top notch I\r\nmade in the other stick, so. Now, you will see how quick we’ll have a\r\nfire here.”\r\n\r\nShe started drawing the bow back and forth, thereby twirling the stick\r\nfirst one way and then the other, and she whirled and whirled and\r\nwhirled it till her arm fairly ached; but nothing came of it. She took\r\na rest and tried again. This time she produced smoke and charred the\r\nsticks a little, but still no fire.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it isn’t the right kind of wood,” said Delbert.\r\n\r\nThat was the beginning of their effort to make fire without matches.\r\nIt was fascinating. With some sticks the smoke would curl up thick and\r\nwhite till Marian’s eyes fairly smarted with it, but no fire appeared.\r\nDelbert tried it, the little girls tried it, and Davie, with great\r\ngravity and earnestness, tried it too.\r\n\r\nThey whittled sticks constantly in the endeavor to get one just right.\r\nThen the craze died out for a few days; but it was taken up again.\r\nMarian was sure that she was doing it just as the Walton’s boys’ uncle\r\nhad done it, and he had produced fire in a very short time,--not more\r\nthan a minute, she was sure. She studied over the problem. It seemed as\r\nif with so much smoke and charring it simply must ignite, but it did\r\nnot. She would rub and rub, till there would be a teaspoonful of brown\r\npowdered wood at the foot of her downward notch, but never a spark.\r\nShe would drop the implements in disgust and go at something else, but\r\nalways next day, or the next, she returned to them and tried again.\r\n\r\nShe had seen it done and she herself could produce a little wreath of\r\nsmoke, while her implements grew hot and actually charred. She tried\r\nwith every kind of driftwood that seemed different from what she had\r\nused before, and while up in the pasture she would cut sticks from the\r\ndifferent growing shrubs and dry them in the hot sun to experiment\r\nwith. Then, one day, as she watched the little pile of black powder\r\nfall from her twirling stick, she saw a bit of it turn to a red glow\r\nand knew that she had succeeded.\r\n\r\nHow they scurried for kindlings and coaxed that tiny bit of brightness!\r\nIt glowed and glowed till all the black powder was burned, and then it\r\nwent out. Well, having once done it, of course she could do it again,\r\nand next time she would be prepared and have fine stuff ready to kindle\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nSo she tried again and again and again, till her arm ached and her\r\nbreath came in gasps. And the children would squat in a circle, their\r\nbright eyes glued to the tiny pile of powdered charred wood, and\r\nEsther, with unvarying monotony, would ask, “Why doesn’t it light,\r\nMarian? Did before”; and presently, “Why doesn’t it light, Marian? Did\r\nbefore.”\r\n\r\nIt was fully a week after the first success before she achieved the\r\nsecond one, and then also, in spite of her best and most earnest\r\nendeavor, she could not kindle it any farther, and when the charred\r\npowder was exhausted it went out.\r\n\r\nOf course, she could not spend all her time upon it, but every day\r\nthere would be a trial of it sandwiched in between other labors.\r\n\r\nShe took particular notice of the wood she was using when success\r\ncrowned her efforts. The little round stick was from a piece of\r\ndriftwood. She did not know what it was, but it was a soft wood that\r\nwhittled easily, and the base piece was from a kind of tree cactus\r\ncalled _echo_.[4]\r\n\r\n  [4] Pronounced _ayʹ tcho_.\r\n\r\nAfter a while she became so accomplished that she could produce fire\r\nabout every tenth time she tried, and in course of time she became much\r\nmore expert than that. She always used _echo_ for her base piece, and\r\nfor the other she found that a certain bush up in the pasture was best.\r\nShe could cut sticks from it and dry them, and they were straight and\r\nround and smooth without any whittling.\r\n\r\nAlso she learned that a handful of grass so old and dry that it had all\r\nturned gray, if it were broken and rubbed till it was very fine, made\r\ngood kindling. With a handful of that over her precious coal of fire,\r\nshe could, with careful coaxing, get a blaze, and then it was easy to\r\nbuild on with other material.\r\n\r\nHaving once learned how, she felt easier. She laid up pieces of the\r\nselected wood in several places on the Island, where they would keep\r\ndry,--carried some away back into the bat cave for one place,--besides\r\nhaving a good supply tucked away in the home Cave.\r\n\r\nWhen they went away from the Island, they would take a couple of the\r\nfire-sticks with them along with Delbert’s arrows. They used to tie\r\nthem high up on the mast to keep them out of the way of spray and\r\nsplashings, and Marian would slip the bottle-bottom into her pocket.\r\nThe glass was somewhat clumsy, however, and there was danger of\r\ncutting her fingers on it, and afterwards they found some shells--big\r\nbarnacles, I think they were--which served the purpose just as well and\r\nwere neater and safer to handle.\r\n\r\nDried grass they could always find; so they could have a fire whenever\r\nthey wanted it without using the matches, which were dropped into the\r\nworkbag to await some possible emergency. On the Island, however, they\r\nfound it more convenient to bury the brands from one fire over to\r\nanother, as they had done before.\r\n\r\nTheir trips to the egg islands, however, did not wait on all of this.\r\nAs before mentioned, there were two of these islands. On the farther\r\nand smaller of the two they found several things that proved of value.\r\nIt was the one the nearer to the mainland, and some time or other there\r\nhad been a house or camp of some description on it. They found the\r\nblackened stones where the food had been cooked over the fire and some\r\nbroken fragments of pottery such as the natives use, and, not far away,\r\nsome scraps of iron so broken and rusty that they could not make up\r\ntheir minds what they had been, but Marian saved them.\r\n\r\nGrowing near were shrubs and bushes like those in their own pasture,\r\nbut Delbert found one bush that had two shoots longer and straighter\r\nthan any he had yet seen, and when cut and trimmed they made better\r\nspear-handles than the one he had been using. And at low tide they\r\nfound there the largest oysters they had yet discovered anywhere.\r\n\r\nWhen back at their own camp, Marian and Delbert resolutely attacked\r\nthe job of making a better spear or harpoon than the one they had.\r\nIt seemed to the girl that if one only understood a little of\r\nblacksmithing, one of the pieces of iron could be altered a little and\r\nmade into a very respectable spear-head, and perhaps, if one did not\r\nunderstand, one could learn a little.\r\n\r\nShe could easily poke the iron into the fire till it grew red-hot. To\r\nhandle it afterwards was the question. She and Delbert were both afraid\r\nof getting burned, and wasted much time because of that fear.\r\n\r\nThey rigged up a rude pair of tongs with some green sticks and a little\r\nrope, and, using the hatchet for a hammer and a flat stone for an\r\nanvil, they began work. It was intensely interesting.\r\n\r\nThe experiment in “duck”-raising proved unsuccessful, for the cormorant\r\nsquabs which they brought home alive would eat nothing but fish, and\r\nas each one of them demanded more than his own weight in food every\r\nday, the children soon found that the task of keeping them fed was a\r\nhopeless one. They killed them all off at once, therefore, and had such\r\na feast of “duck” that they were content to do without that particular\r\nkind of meat for some time to come.\r\n\r\nThey had plenty of eggs and clams, however, and an occasional quail\r\nor rabbit; so they did not need to waste any time searching for food.\r\nDavie and the little girls wandered off to play with the little bone\r\ndolls or the baby burro. Marian glanced toward them or stopped to\r\nlisten sometimes, but the sight of their little forms near by or the\r\nsound of their sweet, childish voices reassured her, and she continued\r\nwith the task in hand.\r\n\r\nA man who understood such things would have done much better even with\r\nthose rude tools. Time and again it seemed to the girl that she could\r\ndo no better, go no further in the task; then some idea would come to\r\none or the other of them, and they would work awhile longer. A full\r\nweek went by before the new tool was finished, a two-pronged affair,\r\none prong a little longer than the other and of a different shape, but\r\nboth sharp and barbed. It fastened quite snugly to the straightest of\r\nthe new handles.\r\n\r\nAfter that she and Delbert went spearing at night in the little harbor,\r\nwhen the tide was just right and the children were asleep. They would\r\ngo out on the raft where there were mango bushes, but for this they\r\nhad to have a torchlight at one end of the raft.\r\n\r\nThey had often seen the Indians at the Port start out at night with\r\ngreat piles of _pitalla_ in their canoes to burn in a huge wire and\r\niron basket, which would cast a bright circle of light for quite a\r\nspace around, in which the fish could be plainly seen. Marian thought\r\nthat the light attracted them.\r\n\r\nThis _pitalla_ is a kind of tree cactus the bark of which is very\r\nresinous and when dry burns with a very hot, bright flame. They could\r\ngather it in the pasture, but they had no wire basket and nothing to\r\nmake one of. The best, it seemed, that they could do was to make a mat\r\nof green banana leaves and mud on the poles and build the fire on that.\r\n\r\nIt was very unsatisfactory, for the water was forever washing over it\r\nand putting it out. Necessity is the mother of invention, however, and\r\nafter a while Marian hunted in the pasture till she found four little\r\ncrotches of the same size, which she cut and trimmed and then fastened\r\non the extreme end of the log by tying them above and below it and to\r\none another. Then, by laying little sticks across them, she made a\r\nplatform which rose about three feet above the surface of the water.\r\nShe made it quite tight by weaving in stout twigs and banana leaves\r\nand stems, and when it was finished, she plastered it over with the\r\nslimiest mud she could find, and on that laid thin flat rocks, fitting\r\nthem with care so that their edges projected past the edge of the\r\nplatform and filling in the little chinks with mud and pebbles. On that\r\nwhen it was finished, she could build her fire with safety, for it was\r\nup out of reach of the water. It was not so good as the iron basket\r\nof the Indians, for it was clumsier, it cast a shadow on the water,\r\nand there was likelihood of its needing frequent repairs; but it would\r\nserve. The supply of fuel could be kept dry by putting it into the\r\nbarrel, which was tied on so that its open side and end were upward.\r\n\r\nWhen they were first left on the Island, Marian would not have dared\r\ntake those night trips. She would not have dared leave the children\r\nalone at the Cave for one thing, but in all the time that they had been\r\nthere they had seen nothing which could have harmed them save the one\r\nrattlesnake which Delbert had killed.\r\n\r\nFrom the Cave they had cleared three paths,--one to the beach, one to\r\nthe garden and the little pier, and one toward the pasture. This last\r\nhad needed no clearing beyond the cutting-out of two or three bushes.\r\nThe path to the pier had been mostly a matter of clearing away loose\r\nstones, and it was easy to follow even in the dark.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was only when Davie was sleepy that the children were left\r\nat the Cave. When he gave promise of being able to keep awake, they all\r\nwent together. Marian would place him on the log between the little\r\ngirls and give them strict instructions that they were not to let go\r\nof him. Then she and Delbert would take turns with the spear and the\r\nsteering of the craft.\r\n\r\nAnd when she had her little flock all with her, Marian would venture\r\nout beyond the little harbor, where the water was shallow and the mango\r\nbushes were thicker, and as long as their fuel lasted they would stay\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIt was a weird scene,--the star-dotted sky above, the black, whispering\r\nwater below, the clumsy raft in the light of the hot fire swept back\r\nby the breeze, the slender, eager-eyed, half-naked boy watching keenly,\r\nas mass after mass of the mango bushes came into the circle of their\r\nlight. Marian generally guided the raft, for she was better at that\r\nthan Delbert, who seemed about as successful as she with the spear.\r\n\r\nNot that either of them had any startling success. Indeed, for a\r\nlong time it always seemed accidental, more the fish’s fault than\r\ntheirs, when one became impaled upon the iron prongs. But the sport\r\nwas exciting, and there was always the need that lay back of it to\r\nkeep their interest spurred up, and after a while they both learned to\r\nstrike quickly and with force, so that, with constant practice, the\r\ntime came when a night’s spearing meant enough fish for one meal at\r\nleast, and, if luck was with them, for more.\r\n\r\nThey had better luck with the spear at night than with the line in the\r\ndaytime, for the hairpin hook was very inadequate and big fish were\r\nforever straightening it out. When a fish was speared, they put it\r\ninto the barrel with the fuel, where one of the girls held a piece of\r\ndrift-wood over it till the wildest of its flopping was past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY HAD BETTER LUCK WITH THE SPEAR AT NIGHT THAN WITH\r\nTHE LINE IN THE DAYTIME]\r\n\r\nDavie generally fell asleep, and then it took the whole attention\r\nof Jennie to hold him safe. Indeed, Marian would not risk him with\r\njust that, and used to take a rope along to tie him when he finally\r\ndozed off. He objected strenuously to being tied as long as he was\r\nawake enough to know it, but, once he was asleep, she could moor him\r\nsecurely, and Jennie could devote herself to keeping him cuddled and\r\ncovered, with no fear that he would roll out of her hands when the raft\r\ncareened with some of the spearman’s wild lunges.\r\n\r\nWhen they had as many fish as they wanted, or, more often, when their\r\nfuel was exhausted, they would paddle back to the little pier, moor the\r\nraft, wash the fishiness off their hands and climb back up to the Cave,\r\nwhere they would cuddle down in bed and quickly go to sleep.\r\n\r\nThen in the quiet, as she thought of her mother, Marian’s eyes would\r\nfill with tears and her outstretched hand would pass lovingly over\r\neach little form. “Safe as yet,” she would whisper, “and, O mother, I\r\npromise to keep them safe till I can give them back to you again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE JAGUAR’S TRACK\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, while poking her inquisitive little nose into Marian’s\r\nworkbag, Esther fished up five or six knobby, roundish little lumps,\r\ndemanding, “What are these, Marian?”\r\n\r\n“Nasturtium seeds,” replied Marian carelessly.\r\n\r\n“’Sturtium seeds?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Why, Marian,” reproachfully; “why haven’t you been planting ’em? Don’t\r\nyou know ’sturtium seeds are good to eat?”\r\n\r\nMarian gazed steadily for a moment at the seeds in the little girl’s\r\noutstretched hand, then she slowly took them into her own.\r\n\r\n“Pocahontas,” she said solemnly, “I never thought of that. Of course\r\nthey are good to eat,--the seeds, leaves, flowers, stems, and all.\r\nWe’ll plant them before the sun goes down to-night.”\r\n\r\n“You’re a great squaw chief, you are,” said Esther scornfully.\r\n“Jennie! Dellie! Looky, here’s ’sturtium seeds been in Marian’s bag all\r\nthis time, an’ she never thought of planting ’em.”\r\n\r\nJennie and Delbert came up excitedly. Jennie, too, was rather inclined\r\nto scorn at such evidence of Marian’s lack of thought, but Delbert\r\nthrew his arms around her and planted vehement kisses on her cheeks.\r\n\r\n“You shan’t scold her,” he declared. “She’s the best squaw chief ever\r\nwas. Nobody could do better, _nobody_ could, and I love her!”\r\n\r\n“So do I! So do I!” shrieked the girls, rushing in to contribute\r\ntheir share of affectionate demonstration, and Davie, dropping the\r\ndig-spoon, ran up, crying, “Do I! Do I!” in parrot-like refrain; and\r\nMarian, laughing, had much ado to keep from being knocked down with the\r\nonslaught.\r\n\r\nBut the seeds were straightway planted, and in time became a profusion\r\nof red and gold and green which delighted the eyes, and incidentally\r\nthe palates, of Marian’s nestful of hungry little hawks, as she called\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn time also came warm weather and rains, and in some respects this\r\nbettered their condition and in some respects it made it worse.\r\n\r\nWith warm weather they needed less bedding and less clothing at all\r\ntimes. Moreover, the rains made things grow. In the pasture there were\r\nseveral things that they knew to be good for greens, and they gathered\r\na mess of some kind every day, boiling them with salt, and wondering\r\nhow it had been that they had once upon a time thought that greens must\r\nhave butter and vinegar to be really good.\r\n\r\nBut the rains brought gnats and mosquitoes to some extent, and\r\nsometimes these were so bad among the mango bushes that they could\r\ntake no comfort in fishing. Sometimes, too, they troubled them so that\r\nthey could scarcely sleep of nights, though their Cave was so high up\r\non the hill that there was usually a light breeze that drove away the\r\ninsect invaders. When the pests were very bad, the tribe would draw the\r\ntablecloth over their faces or would throw grass and green leaves on\r\nthe fire, making a “smudge” that would subdue their tormentors.\r\n\r\nMarian thought the bananas had begun to respond a little to the\r\ncultivation she had given them in the way of thinning out their\r\nnumbers. At any rate, they were bearing a slightly better class of\r\nfruit. As soon as a bunch ripened a little, the birds would promptly\r\nstart in to take their share, and she would cut down the stalk and take\r\nthe bunch up to the cave, where she could keep it safely covered up\r\ntill it was ripe enough to be good eating.\r\n\r\nWith these and the greens and the watermelons she felt always sure of\r\na sufficient commissary supply. Still, they were as keen as ever to\r\ndetect new food. One day Delbert came in with several bulbs, or roots,\r\nthat he had dug up in the pasture. He said they looked good enough to\r\neat and he wanted to try them.\r\n\r\nMarian was very doubtful, but finally put them to roast in the coals\r\nwhile they went down for their morning swim, intending to offer one to\r\nthe baby burro when they got back. They had taught the burro to eat\r\neverything that they did, and Delbert had suggested that they try the\r\nnew food on him first.\r\n\r\nHe was willing to be cautious, but he was not willing to let a\r\nperfectly good food lie in the ground unused because they were not\r\ncourageous enough to find out about it. If the burro had no trouble\r\nwith it, Marian herself would sample a little, but very cautiously.\r\nShe would hold a little of it in her mouth awhile first and see if\r\nanything came of it, and if it seemed all right they would all eat a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nThey had a fine swim. There were nice little breakers on the open side\r\nof the Island that morning. The children would run out a little way,\r\nwait till the right moment, then turn dextrously and let the foamy wave\r\nsweep them up on the beach. Marian kept hold of Davie, for the water\r\nwas far too rough to trust his safety to his own little legs, sturdy\r\nthough they were. But, with her to hold his hand, he had no fear, and\r\nlaughed as loudly as the rest when the water slapped him off his feet\r\nand swept him up with the seaweed and the crabs. After a while he said\r\nhe was tired and wanted to go and dig; so his sister let go of him, and\r\nhe trotted off to where he had left the dig-spoon under a rock, and a\r\nmoment later was excavating most industriously, while Marian turned her\r\nattention to the others.\r\n\r\nThey all joined hands and waded out a little farther than she had cared\r\nto go with Davie. It was splendid fun, but pretty soon Jennie called\r\nout, “Look, Marian! Davie is going up to the Cave!”\r\n\r\nThey all looked; sure enough the little fellow was almost up the hill.\r\nDelbert became excited immediately.\r\n\r\n“I’ll just bet he will go to monkeying with those potatoes!” he cried,\r\nand started forthwith for the beach. The same thought had crossed\r\nMarian’s mind at the same instant, and, ordering the little girls to\r\ncome too, she followed close at Delbert’s heels.\r\n\r\nThey made all speed for the Cave, but they got there too late. Davie\r\nwas just gulping down the last mouthful as they reached him.\r\n\r\nHe did his best to look sweetly innocent as he told them it was\r\n“goo-ood!” Delbert’s face was a study. He was provoked enough to shake\r\nhis little brother thoroughly, yet he was frightened enough to cry.\r\nMarian’s face turned pale. Perhaps the things were perfectly harmless,\r\nperhaps even highly nutritious, but again perhaps they were deadly\r\npoison. She dared not risk it, and tried everything she could think of\r\nto force the small gourmand to disgorge his stolen--or shall we say\r\nmisappropriated?--tidbit.\r\n\r\nIt was no use. Davie would not drink a lot of warm salt water, and he\r\nwould not let Marian run her fingers down his throat either.\r\n\r\nShe tried coaxing first, to no avail, and then she used force, but\r\nthough they managed, by holding his nose, to get a few spoonfuls\r\nof the emergency emetic down his throat, and though Marian got her\r\nfingers well bitten, at the end of an hour or so the potatoes had not\r\nreappeared, and Marian, regarding the thoroughly enraged and squawling\r\nyoungster, reflected that if any harm had been going to result from\r\nhis impromptu lunch it would probably have begun to take effect before\r\nthen, and so gave up the struggle.\r\n\r\nStill she was not easy. She watched him closely all day. After he got\r\nover his fit of temper he went about his play just as usual.\r\n\r\nSeveral times in the night the elder sister awoke with a start, and,\r\nleaning over him, held her breath till she heard the regular rising and\r\nfalling of his. All the next day she watched, but everything seemed to\r\nbe perfectly normal, and in the afternoon Delbert brought in another\r\nbatch of the potatoes, which they did try on the burro. Davie watched\r\nwith great interest. He said again that they were “goo-ood,” but he\r\ndid not offer to eat any himself. Marian thought that if her fight the\r\nday before had not accomplished the end she worked for, it had probably\r\ntaught Davie to attend more strictly to his own business, which might\r\nbe of great advantage some time in the future.\r\n\r\nThe burro also said the bulbs, or potatoes as Delbert called them, were\r\ngood, and ate all Delbert would give him; so afterwards they tried them\r\nthemselves. They found them somewhat like rather poor sweet potatoes,\r\nbut they were a welcome change for their bill of fare, nevertheless.\r\nBut they could not find them very often.\r\n\r\nThe baby burro was a great comfort to the children. Sometimes, when\r\nthey were quite sure his mother was not near, they would let him out\r\nof the corral, and he would follow them about like a dog. They even\r\nmade him drag home little bundles of wood for them sometimes. The other\r\nburros were quite tame, but not enough so to be handled at will.\r\n\r\nOften the children had glimpses of the deer and sometimes of the pigs.\r\nMarian had been afraid at first that these latter might be the wild\r\npeccaries and more or less dangerous, but, after seeing them quite\r\nclose one time, she concluded that they were not, for they certainly\r\nlooked like the domesticated pig except that they were not at all fat.\r\n\r\nAlways they kept watch of the sea, never forgetting that each day might\r\nbring rescue, but, though many and many a sail passed by in the distant\r\nGulf, never a one turned into San Moros. Sometimes, indeed, Indian\r\ncanoes had been seen inside the narrow sandbars that divided San Moros\r\nfrom the Gulf, hunting turtles maybe, but they did not come within\r\nsignaling distance of Smugglers’.\r\n\r\nMarian’s white skirt was flapping itself to tatters. Sometimes a heavy\r\nwind and rain tore it down altogether, and they would find it beaten\r\ninto the sand, but it was always rescued, washed, dried, and sent aloft\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe rainy days were the dreariest. Then there was nothing to do but\r\ncurl up at the Cave. The brush shade they had built in front did not\r\navail to keep out the rain. Before the rainy season was over they got\r\nso sick and tired of huddling in the Cave every time it rained that\r\nthey would reduce their clothing to a minimum and go on with their\r\noccupations as if nothing were happening. If you really don’t mind\r\ngetting wet, there is a fascination in becoming a part of the gray,\r\ndrizzling landscape. But they preferred the sunshine.\r\n\r\nOne day, as Jennie tossed down an armload of wood beside the fire down\r\nby the beach, something about her suddenly arrested Marian’s attention.\r\nShe looked startled.\r\n\r\n“Jennie,” she said, “come here.”\r\n\r\nJennie came wondering, while Marian, dish-towel in hand, stood\r\nmotionless, gazing at her.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked the sweet-faced little girl.\r\n\r\nHer sister did not speak for a moment longer, then, “Lift up your\r\nskirt,” she said. Jennie obeyed, revealing her little bare legs.\r\n\r\nEsther, drawing near, lifted her skirt also. Marian put down her dish\r\nand towel and knelt in front of the two for a closer inspection.\r\n\r\n“Jennie,” she said finally, “Jennie, you are actually getting fat.”\r\n\r\n“Is she?” questioned Esther. “She isn’t as fat as I.”\r\n\r\nMarian took off Jennie’s jacket and inspected her arms. Delbert drew\r\nnear, and Davie came up to pass his expert opinion on the subject. “You\r\nare getting fat,” repeated Marian.\r\n\r\nAnd it was so. The little face was rosy, the cheeks were not hollow\r\nnow, and the chin was not so pointed as it used to be. The little legs,\r\nthough not so plump as those of Esther’s showing, were really and truly\r\nrounded out.\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Delbert, “she hasn’t been sick, you know, not since we\r\nhave been here, and we have been here ’most a year.”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Marian, “she has not been sick. She has not even complained\r\nof feeling badly, as far as I can remember. Do you ever feel bad any\r\nmore, Jennie?”\r\n\r\nJennie soberly examined her sensations for a moment.\r\n\r\n“I feel hungry,” she said.\r\n\r\nMarian laughed,--a long ringing peal; but there were tears in her eyes\r\ntoo as she went back to her task. It was stewed “duck” that morning,\r\none that Delbert had shot with his bow and arrow and then swam out and\r\ngot. It was stewed duck and watermelon,--all they could eat of the\r\nlatter,--and after breakfast they armed themselves with the longest\r\npoles they could get and went up into the pasture after the fruit of\r\nthe _pitalla_ cactus.\r\n\r\nThis was the cactus whose dried bark they burned on their spearing\r\nexpeditions. The fruit grows high up and must be poked off with a long\r\nstick and then have its many spines carefully removed before it can be\r\neaten. Fortunately, when it is ripe the spines come off easily and the\r\ncenter is cool, sweet, and nutritious. They were very plentiful, and\r\nsometimes they stewed them down in the little granite kettle, stirring\r\nthem constantly. This made a thick, syrupy jam that the children were\r\nvery fond of indeed.\r\n\r\nMarian filled her two-quart glass jar and set it away till times when\r\nthere should be none of the fresh fruit to be had.\r\n\r\nConning their prospects over and over, Marian often pondered on the\r\nchance held out by the mainland. With the aid of the log they could\r\neasily reach it. It was not nearly so far across the harbor as it was\r\ndown to the egg islands. They could manage the raft so well now, and\r\nthey could all swim so well, that she was not afraid of going anywhere\r\nwhen the water was smooth.\r\n\r\nAnd the mainland was just across the quiet little harbor. Suppose they\r\ncrossed over, what was the chance of making their way to some ranch or\r\nsettlement? Delbert could not remember just what it was that Clarence\r\nhad said about it, but it was something about there not being a house\r\nfor fifty miles, or was it a hundred?--he was not sure.\r\n\r\nA wild tangle of thorny woods, no road or path, no compass to guide\r\nthem! Perhaps a lagoon of water, perhaps not; perhaps plenty of\r\n_pitallas_, perhaps not! Marian always shook her head at the end. Here\r\non the Island she was sure of food, here was safety and shelter, but\r\nout there--How long would it be before Davie would tire out and she\r\nwould have to carry him? And then their path to be cut through how\r\nmany miles of thorny brush? And no certainty then that they were not\r\ntraveling in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nNo! And still it drew her, that mainland.\r\n\r\nPerhaps if they could climb to the top of those hills they could look\r\nout over the land beyond, and perhaps some sign of a ranch might be\r\nseen in the far distance.\r\n\r\nMany a time she had felt humbly grateful to Clarence for the things\r\nhe had taught them, odds and ends of stray knowledge that had come in\r\ntheir need to be like precious jewels,--how to get oysters and clams,\r\nhow to sail a boat, how to paddle, and many other things. Now she felt\r\na little provoked that he had not taught them more.\r\n\r\nWhy in the wide world couldn’t he have told Delbert where the nearest\r\nhabitation was, and what it was?--for it was quite likely that he knew.\r\nHow had he got his information? she wondered.\r\n\r\nWhen she suggested to Delbert that they cross over the harbor and climb\r\nthat highest mountain and see what they could see, he was very willing;\r\nhe had thought of it himself.\r\n\r\nSo they started out one morning, taking water with them, but depending\r\non the _pitallas_ they would find for food. They crossed over easily\r\nenough and did not have much trouble in reaching the foot of the\r\nmountain. But the ascent was not an easy matter. There was cactus of\r\nevery description, all interwoven with thorny brush,--such a thick,\r\nmatted underbrush that the children were scratched and pricked all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nDavie was crying lustily before long, and Jennie fell and, in her\r\nefforts to catch herself, rolled a stone on Esther’s foot that showed\r\nblack and blue for many a day afterwards. Sometimes there would be\r\na space comparatively clear where they could pick their way without\r\nencountering thorns at every step, and it was in one of these that\r\nMarian saw that which turned her back and kept her feet from the\r\nmainland for a year to come.\r\n\r\nThey had just come up a particularly steep part of the mountain, where\r\nan outcropping ledge added to the difficulties for little climbing\r\nfeet. Above it was space to breathe before one had to cope with the\r\nnext ledge above, which rose in an abrupt cliff. There was a _pitalla_\r\ntree there with a dozen fruit on it, all opened out red and inviting,\r\nand Delbert started with the long pole to bring them down.\r\n\r\nMarian paused to get a thorn out of Esther’s thumb and two from her\r\nnext-to-the-littlest toe, and when that was finished the little girl\r\nran on to help the others gather the fruit, and the older one, rising,\r\nput the needle carefully into a little case she had and slipped it into\r\nher pocket. Her supply of needles was limited and she must not lose a\r\nsingle one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERE WAS A CAT-TRACK]\r\n\r\nThen, as she turned to join the others, her eye fell to the ground at\r\nher feet, and there, plain and distinct, was a cat-track so large that\r\nshe could not have covered it with one of her hands, and her hands\r\nwere not so very small either. Fascinated, she stared at it. There\r\nwas no doubt as to what it was. She glanced around, but could see no\r\nothers. The ground chanced to be a little soft in that particular\r\nspot. But surely that one was enough; there was no need of more. What\r\na monster it must have been to have made that track! Marian drew in\r\na quick breath and then threw up her head and called casually, “O\r\nchildren, come back now. We won’t go any farther.”\r\n\r\nDelbert, his eyes wide with surprise, came quickly with some protesting\r\nwords, but Marian frowned warningly at him and with a tilt of her chin\r\nindicated the track. His gaze found it instantly. Indeed, it seemed to\r\nMarian to be the most conspicuous feature of the landscape.\r\n\r\nHe bent his head toward it a moment; then his eyes met hers again. For\r\na second they looked at each other; there was no need of words. He\r\nturned back to the _pitalla_ to hurry the others back, and Marian saw\r\nhim casting surreptitious glances at the cliff above them.\r\n\r\nThe little girls and Davie were so glad to turn back that they asked\r\nno questions, taking it for granted that the plan was changed because\r\nthere were too many thorns.\r\n\r\nThe two older ones were rather silent on the way back. They went as\r\nquickly as they could, but it was not a thing that could be done so\r\nvery quickly, and Marian grew more and more nervous. Supposing the\r\ncreature saw them, supposing--she jerked herself up and mentally gave\r\nherself a good scolding, but never was she so glad as when they left\r\nthe mountain behind and pushed through to where the raft was tied,\r\nwaiting for them.\r\n\r\nAs they pushed out and paddled back, calmness came to her. There were\r\nhard things in her pathway, dreary things to face, but, compared with\r\nwhat might be, her life seemed full of rosebuds and sunshine.\r\n\r\nFour pair of bright, loving eyes looked at her; four healthy, warm,\r\nbreathing little bodies would lie within reach of her touch that night.\r\nSuppose one were ever missing through her fault or carelessness, what\r\npleasure would life hold then?\r\n\r\nLooking back at the face of the mountain, she judged that they had\r\nclimbed about a third of the way up.\r\n\r\nIt was well into the afternoon when they got home, and a hungry lot\r\nthey were, too.\r\n\r\nThat night Delbert waited till he was sure the little ones were asleep\r\nand then he cautiously spoke Marian’s name.\r\n\r\nShe was awake. “What is it?”\r\n\r\nHe turned over and raised himself on his elbow.\r\n\r\n“Do you--do you suppose--it could swim over?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t think so,” said she; “it is probably strong enough, but it\r\nseems to me I have read that they never go into the water unless they\r\nare compelled to. No, I am quite sure it would never do that.”\r\n\r\nDelbert drew a long breath of relief.\r\n\r\n“I know the house kitty never wanted to get her toes wet,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No, we are quite safe from it here.”\r\n\r\n“I guess we’d better stay here,” he said.\r\n\r\nThey did stay there. When the weather turned cold again, they were\r\nin better condition than they had been the year before. They had two\r\nrabbit-skin blankets, or robes, that kept out the chill winds at\r\nnight, and they had the brush shelter in front of the Cave so thick and\r\nmatted and interwoven with banana leaves and strips of stalk that the\r\nwind did not penetrate that either; so with the bright fire they could\r\nbe comfortable through the evenings and cold nights. In the daytime\r\nthey were always so active that the cold did not much trouble them.\r\nBesides, it soon warmed up after the sun rose.\r\n\r\nOne day, while up in the pasture, hunting food and fuel, they noticed\r\nan unusually large mescal or century-plant. These were very common on\r\nthe island, and Marian had never thought of any use they could put\r\nthem to, but that day it suddenly dawned upon her that very similar\r\nplants were cultivated in some places for the rope fiber in the great\r\nsharp-pointed leaves. Perhaps it would be stronger and better than\r\nbanana fiber. So they dug this one up by the roots and dragged it home.\r\n\r\nThey chopped off the thick leaves and tossed the stump to one side.\r\nThen, with some stones, the hatchet, and the knives, they thumped and\r\npounded and smashed the leaves and worked and scraped away till they\r\ngot the fiber out, and when they finally did get it, it seemed to\r\nMarian that it really was better than banana fiber. That evening they\r\nwould see what kind of a rope could be made out of the new material. So\r\nafter supper they got at it, sitting before their fire at the Cave.\r\n\r\nThey did not braid their ropes any more; they had learned better than\r\nthat; but they both felt that their method of rope-making could be\r\nvastly improved upon, for it was a very slow process at best, and the\r\nrope finally produced was a very uneven thing.\r\n\r\nBut ropes they had to have. The raft must always be well lashed\r\ntogether, and ropes so used soon wore out. Their fences were tied with\r\nropes in many places. They never went on any excursion without taking\r\nsome ropes along, for they were constantly wanting them, chiefly,\r\nperhaps, to tie about their bundles of wood. A very large bundle of\r\nheavy sticks could be quite easily dragged home with a rope.\r\n\r\nIn the first place they had had only Delbert’s hair rope and had used\r\nit for everything, but now they were trying to be as saving of it as\r\npossible, never using it when another one would suffice, but Delbert\r\nalways carried it with him, coiled up and tied at his waist.\r\n\r\nWhen they finished working out the fiber it was clean, straight, and\r\npretty as it lay in a neat pile.\r\n\r\n“Now, how is the best way to do this?” asked Marian in a businesslike\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n“I have been thinking,” said Delbert. “Remember that time I went with\r\nClarence and his father after a load of corn? Well, at one place where\r\nwe stopped there was an old Indian making ropes. I’ve been trying for a\r\nlong time to remember how he did it. Dear me!” he exclaimed in disgust,\r\n“why didn’t I pay ’tention? Clarence explained it all to me, but I just\r\nlet it go into one ear and out the other. I wasn’t interested in making\r\nropes then.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you remember anything about it at all?” asked his sister\r\nsympathetically. “If you could just remember a point or two, we could\r\nwork it out from that, maybe. Davie, don’t you want to put a stick of\r\nwood on the fire? Not that one, dear; that one won’t burn,” for Davie\r\nhad picked up the stump of the mescal plant and heaved it into the\r\ncenter of the flames.\r\n\r\n“Yes, will burn,” asserted he complacently, and returned to his play of\r\nfitting little clamshells together and laying them in a row.\r\n\r\nJennie poked the stump to one side and raked the coals and hot ashes\r\nover it. “We’ll dry it out, and then maybe it’ll burn, Davie dear,” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Here,” said Esther, gingerly handing over a piece of particularly\r\nthorny _pitalla_; “this will make a light.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you see,” said Delbert, “they had the fiber--_este_ they call\r\nit--all in a pile, but tangled as if they must have tangled it\r\nthemselves. They had that part of it all done when we got there, but I\r\nremember Clarence said they laid it on something--a board, I guess--and\r\nhooked one end over a nail to hold it, and scraped it with an old\r\nmachete blade fixed in a crooked stick,--scraped it and scraped it till\r\nthere wasn’t anything left of the leaf but the fiber; then, I s’pose,\r\nthey tangled it all up next; anyway, the man had a thing he whirled\r\nand he backed off across the yard, a-whirling it and whirling it and\r\nspinning a strand of rope out from that pile of _este_.”\r\n\r\n“Was it a wheel he whirled?”\r\n\r\n“No, it wasn’t. It was just a little stick thing he held in one\r\nhand,--two sticks, one of them whirled on the other.”\r\n\r\n“Give me your knife,” said Marian, “and, Jennie, hand me that piece of\r\ndriftwood there by you; no, the other one. Was the stick he had as long\r\nas that, Delbert?”\r\n\r\n“Just about, but it was nice and smooth.”\r\n\r\n“This will be nice and smooth when I get through with it. You just\r\ntangle some of that fiber the way the old Indian had his.”\r\n\r\nDelbert began picking it apart and dropping it careless and crisscross.\r\n\r\n“You can just bet,” he burst out, “you can just bet your _boots_, if I\r\never have a chance to see anybody else doing anything again, I’ll _see_\r\nwhat they are doing; don’t care what it is.”\r\n\r\n“That is the best way,” admitted Marian. “There are a whole lot of\r\nthings, simple things, that would help us a great deal if we only knew\r\nhow to do them. Can’t you remember anything more Clarence said about\r\nthis?”\r\n\r\nDelbert wrinkled his brows. “There was something about a\r\nbalance-wheel. What is a balance-wheel?”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that I can explain it, though I know what it is myself.\r\nMaybe I can show you pretty soon. Hand me that little smooth stick\r\nabout a foot and a half long, that one with the knob on the end. Yes, I\r\nthink that will do nicely.”\r\n\r\nShe had shaved and whittled the piece of driftwood till it was about a\r\nfoot long, an inch thick, and two and one half inches wide at one end\r\nand tapering to a point at the other, which point she whittled into a\r\nbutton-like knob. Just back of the knob she made a hole big enough to\r\nslip the second stick into. It slipped down, but was prevented from\r\nslipping clear off by the knob on the end of it. Then, grasping this\r\nsecond stick, she began to whirl it so that the driftwood stick whirled\r\nround and round on it.\r\n\r\n“There!” she cried; “does that look anything like it, Delbert?”\r\n\r\n“It does! it does! That’s it exactly! How did you guess?”\r\n\r\n“I didn’t guess. I have seen one myself somewhere, but didn’t know what\r\nit was for. I think I saw a couple of them down at Doña Luisa’s one\r\nmorning when I went down for milk. But the proof of the pudding is in\r\nthe eating. Let’s see how this complicated machine will work.”\r\n\r\nShe twisted a little of the tangled fiber round the knob on the\r\ndriftwood stick and began to twirl. Of course it promptly twisted the\r\nfiber into a little strand.\r\n\r\n“Here, Delbert,” she said, “you whirl this while I spin out the strand,\r\nor else it will all twist up in bunches.” Sitting down by the little\r\npile of fibers, she grasped the twisting strand in one hand so that it\r\nshould spin out of an even size. “Now, whirl away,” she said, “and back\r\noff as fast as it spins out.”\r\n\r\n“This is just the way they did it,” said Delbert. “I remember now,\r\nthere were two of them; one whirled the stick, and the other sat down\r\nand pulled the strand out of the pile of fiber just as you are doing\r\nit.” And he backed off, whirling vigorously, until the little pile of\r\ntangled fibers was all used up.\r\n\r\n“There,” she said, “that is a lot better than twisting it just with our\r\nfingers, as we have been doing with the banana fiber, and it certainly\r\nbeats braiding all hollow. We can twist and twist and twist, and then\r\nwe can put as many strands as we want to into the rope.”\r\n\r\nThey worked that night till they had used up all their fiber, and then\r\nwent to bed, agreeing to go next day and gather more mescal plants.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when Marian raked open her fire, she raked out the\r\nstump of the mescal plant. It was brown and juicy. She began to examine\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“Looks good. Doesn’t it?” she said to the children, who were rolling\r\nout of the Cave.\r\n\r\nEsther came suddenly forward and bent over it. “It is good, too,” she\r\ndeclared. “That is the stuff they had down at Julianita’s one day. They\r\nwere eating it, and said for Jennie and me to eat some too, but Jennie\r\nwouldn’t touch it ’cause she was ’fraid it would make us drunk.”\r\n\r\n“You didn’t eat any either,” remonstrated Jennie.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t ’cause you didn’t.”\r\n\r\nMarian was cutting the stump in pieces. They all tried it. It was\r\nsweet and good, though there was a great deal of string and fiber to\r\nbe discarded after the sweetness and goodness had been chewed out and\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\n“But it _is_ what they make mescal of; isn’t it?” asked Delbert.\r\n\r\n“I presume it is; in fact, it must be, only this wild plant doesn’t\r\ngrow just the same as the tame ones, maybe; but it must be that they\r\ncook the centers something like this and mash them and let them ferment\r\nand distill it some way. It seems to me I have heard how it was done,\r\nbut I was like you about the ropes; I didn’t pay enough attention to\r\nremember. It certainly never occurred to me that there was anything\r\nabout it that was any good to _us_. I think we owe Davie a vote of\r\nthanks.”\r\n\r\n“Clarence ought to have told us,” said Esther reproachfully.\r\n\r\nSo another food was added to their list, and after a little practice\r\nthey could turn out mescal fiber ropes that were so smooth and well\r\ntwisted that they could be used to lasso with.\r\n\r\nThe two little girls had learned to lasso burros, but Marian’s aim\r\nwas not much better than Davie’s. She did not practice the art as her\r\nlittle sisters did. She whittled out a big crochet-hook, though, and\r\nthen twisted a very fine strand of fiber and crocheted a bag of it that\r\nwas very useful to put things into on their travels. Whenever there was\r\na storm, they would always go to Bonanza Cove afterwards to collect the\r\nriches found there.\r\n\r\nThese consisted mostly of driftwood, and the small pieces could go\r\ninto the bag, while the big ones were tied together and carried or\r\ndragged home. But sometimes other things came, bottles empty but\r\ncorked,--so many of them that Marian concluded all sailors must be sad\r\ndrinkers,--bits of board, an old leaky bucket, and, best of all, this\r\nsecond year, a broken oar.\r\n\r\n“I hope it didn’t incommode any one much when it broke,” Marian said,\r\n“but we certainly can make good use of it.” It was just barely long\r\nenough to use as a paddle.\r\n\r\nWhen it came nesting-time again, they were right on hand at the bird\r\nislands. They would put the eggs into the bag and the demijohn and a\r\nfew young squabs into the barrel, and they were so much better equipped\r\nfor the cruise than they were the first time they made the trip that\r\nit did not seem such a big undertaking, and they could go oftener.\r\n\r\nOnce, while out on one of the sandbars, hunting clams, they saw\r\nsomething farther out still, something dark on the water. Delbert\r\nthought it was probably only a mass of seaweed, but he wanted to go\r\nand see. So, as the water was very smooth that morning, they paddled\r\nthe raft out, though they had never been so near the Gulf before since\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\nThey found the dark spot to be another log, much smaller and somewhat\r\nshorter than the one in their raft, but they took it in tow just the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nThey found some turtle-eggs on those sunny sandbars that second summer.\r\nSometimes they saw the turtles themselves, but they were never able to\r\ncatch one, though Delbert was very enthusiastic in the pursuit.\r\n\r\nThat summer they had vegetables; and how good they were! The turnips\r\nand carrots grew splendidly, and the children devoured them both\r\ncooked and raw. The green peppers, for some reason, did not flourish\r\nso well till the next year, but they were eaten with a relish also.\r\nThe lettuce, when transplanted and cared for, set in solid heads that\r\nreminded them of cabbage, and the children ate it like so many hungry\r\nlittle calves eating clover, and Marian often boiled a head of it with\r\na fowl, and they voted it fine.\r\n\r\nThe bananas bore good fruit now, large, well-filled-out bunches. Marian\r\ndried some. Among the edible fruits of the Island was the wild tomato.\r\nThey found very few of these, and the fruit was very small, scarcely\r\nlarger than the tip of Marian’s little finger, but when the seeds were\r\nplanted in their garden they came up and did well, plenty of water\r\nincreasing the size and quality of the fruit somewhat. The plants bore\r\nabundantly, and the flavor was good. They put them in soups or stewed\r\nthem by themselves sometimes, sweetening them with the juice boiled\r\nfrom the _pitallas_, or, at rare intervals, with wild honey. But the\r\ngreater portion of them were eaten raw.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly no lack of food now. Delbert did not set traps any\r\nmore. He could shoot so well with his bow and arrow that he did not\r\nneed traps to secure a rabbit when one was wanted, and the little\r\ngirls could sometimes hit a hopping mark as well as he.\r\n\r\nThey lost the hook one day, some big fish making off with it, and they\r\ncaught their fish entirely with the spear after that.\r\n\r\nThey were milking two burros. Jacky, being thoroughly weaned, was\r\nturned out of the corral and went where he pleased, and he generally\r\npleased to go with the children whenever they were going where he could\r\nfollow. Jennie was really plump now, strong and healthy, but not so\r\nstrong or so healthy as Esther, who, solid little urchin, could follow\r\nDelbert very closely in all his exploits. She could run as far without\r\ngetting tired, she could shoot an arrow with almost as accurate an aim,\r\nand she did not always miss the fish she aimed her spear at.\r\n\r\nShe was a splendid little swimmer, better even than Marian, and it used\r\nto seem to Marian that she was the prettiest little mermaid any one\r\never set eyes on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MUGGYWAH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time came when Marian had to face the problem of clothing. Every\r\nbathing-suit was worn to rags, and everything else was so near it that\r\nthere was no trusting anything. When the weather was cold they had\r\ntheir wraps, and these covered a multitude of tattered sins, and none\r\nof the tribe save Marian herself ever wore anything into the water any\r\nmore, but even with such economy there was no dodging the issue any\r\nlonger. Unless she were willing that her flock should revert to extreme\r\nsavagery in costumes, something had to be done.\r\n\r\nHer first attempt was to crochet clothing out of fiber, but it took\r\nso long to make a garment that way that she was always eagerly on the\r\nalert for other modes. She remembered that soaking skins in wet ashes\r\nwould remove the hair. Old Mr. Faston had said so once. So she tried\r\nit with some rabbit-skins. It worked very well. After being packed in\r\na little hollow of the rock with ashes and water all night, the fur\r\nwas easily pulled off. Then, when the ashes were washed off and the\r\nskin was nearly dry, it could be rubbed and worked till it was soft and\r\npliable and Marian could begin dressmaking.\r\n\r\nRabbits were getting scarce in their immediate vicinity, however, and\r\nthe search for better hunting-grounds took them back to the mainland\r\nagain. They did not cross the harbor and go to climbing mountains this\r\ntime, however. They took the raft down the bay and followed one of the\r\nwinding _esteros_ that led between mango bushes, off and off, farther\r\nand farther, twisting and turning and growing narrower and more and\r\nmore shallow till they came out into a comparatively level country,\r\nwith no hills near at hand, but great stretches of mud flats and\r\nsandbanks and miles and miles of _pitalla_ and scrubby brush.\r\n\r\nThey took the raft as far as they could and tied it to some bushes and\r\nproceeded afoot. They wandered several miles, taking care not to lose\r\ntheir bearings. They found wagon-loads of fine _pitalla_ and some other\r\nwood, rabbits galore, and a few stone or flint arrowheads, but no sign\r\nwhatever of human habitation.\r\n\r\nDelbert shot eight big jack rabbits, Esther got three, and Jennie two,\r\nthirteen in all. They decided that the unluckiness of the number was\r\nfor the rabbits, not for them. They took only the skins home with them,\r\nfor they did not need the meat, and they had plenty of other things to\r\ncarry back to the raft.\r\n\r\nThey loaded it with all the good dry _pitalla_ they could pile up and\r\ntie on. Down close by the water, half buried in the salty mud, Delbert\r\nfound a stone hatchet. Once before he had found a broken one, but this\r\nwas perfect. He held it in his hand with a dreamy look on his face.\r\n“How long ago do you s’pose it was, Marian, when they made ’em and used\r\n’em like this one?”\r\n\r\n“Mercy! I have no idea; hundreds of years at the least and like as not\r\na million.”\r\n\r\n“Well, anyway, it’s mine now,” he said decidedly, as he dropped it into\r\nthe fiber bag.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I think you can keep it with a clear conscience. Now, get on\r\nhere, all of you. Never mind that crab, Davie; you don’t need it,\r\nanyway.”\r\n\r\nThey did not get home till the moon was well up.\r\n\r\nThere was probably stuff growing at her hand that would have given\r\nthose skins a good tan, if Marian had only known what it was and how\r\nto use it, but she did not. The soaking in ashes did fairly well; only\r\nif the skin got well wet afterwards, it would dry stiff unless it was\r\nworked and kept pliable while drying. Of course there was no strength\r\nin the rabbit-skins. They tore easily, but they were, nevertheless, a\r\nmaterial of which Marian could make simple clothes, so that they should\r\nnot be entirely naked if any one ever did come along. She made dresses\r\nfor the little girls first, the simplest style she could think of,\r\neliminating sleeves altogether and not continuing the skirts below the\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nShe crocheted belts of fiber, and used it also to sew with, for her\r\nsupply of thread was very low indeed. There was no need of buttons; the\r\nlittle girls just slipped the dresses over their heads, slipped their\r\narms through the generous armholes, belted the slight fullness at the\r\nwaist, and there you were--pretty as pictures, too.\r\n\r\nThe only foreign articles in the construction of those robes were the\r\nbelt-buckles, which Marian had contrived out of the fasteners of their\r\nold stocking-supporters. Of course the elastic and the stockings had\r\nworn out long ago. Every one was barefoot now except Marian, who was\r\nnear enough to it, but the soles of her shoes had been very thick and\r\ngood, and though the tops were worn out she still managed to use the\r\nbottoms as sandals and thus had some protection to her feet, which\r\nsomehow she could never get toughened as the children’s were.\r\n\r\nAfter several more trips up the _estero_ and more or less success in\r\nhunting, they had enough rabbit-skins to make Marian a dress too. She\r\nmade it just as she had the other two, belting it with her red leather\r\nbelt, which she had worn for several years, but which was still as\r\nstrong as new. Her dress came a little below her knees.\r\n\r\nThe rabbit-skins were not at all satisfactory for Delbert. He was in\r\nand out of the water so constantly, and climbed and scrambled over the\r\nrocks so much, that a garment that must not be wet and that would not\r\nstand strain was not at all what he needed.\r\n\r\nHe told Marian that all he wanted was a loin-cloth such as other\r\nIndians wore, but Marian was not at all sure how loin-cloths were made\r\nor worn. She thought about cutting off an end of one of the blankets,\r\nbut rather hated to do that; so she worked away with her hook and\r\nthe banana fiber till she had evolved what satisfied him. And when\r\nhe donned it and strode along, shirtless and barelegged, his hair\r\nstringing over his shoulders and kept out of his eyes by a red rag tied\r\naround his forehead, and the rag stuck full of feathers, he certainly\r\nlooked not unlike an aborigine of some sort.\r\n\r\nDavie declined even a loin-cloth; simple nature unadorned suited him to\r\na T.\r\n\r\nThus, between the bananas and the rabbits, Marian managed to keep her\r\nfamily clothed.\r\n\r\nThey took many trips to the mainland. There were several _esteros_ that\r\nled far inland, and they explored them all. They became accustomed to\r\ngoing without water. They always had _some_ with them, but it was such\r\na bother to take a lot of bottles along every time they stirred out\r\nfrom home that they trained themselves not to want a drink every little\r\nwhile. They would take a big drink before they left the Island in the\r\nmorning, and often no one would take another till noon. Also they\r\nlearned to go without much food in the middle of the day and to eat\r\nthat little raw.\r\n\r\nChildren are children the world over, I fancy. These had their little\r\ngames and plays, which Marian was always ready to foster. The little\r\ngirls and Davie used to put their dolls to bed every night, tucking\r\nthem in as carefully as they did themselves. Also the dolls were\r\nusually carried with them, if they were making a trip of any great\r\nlength, lest they should get lonesome and frightened if left too long\r\nalone. They traveled in a little fiber bag Jennie crocheted, and were\r\ngenerally hung up on the mast where they were well out of the way of\r\nthe water, and if they went inland Jennie would wear the bag hung about\r\nher neck.\r\n\r\nWhen they went in swimming, the children would play they were\r\nfishes and other water creatures and would imitate the different\r\ncharacteristics as well as they could. Davie’s favorite\r\ncharacterization was that of the crab. He would run sideways on\r\nall fours and pinch the other children’s toes. He played this so\r\nstrenuously that he often made himself something of a nuisance and had\r\nto be tactfully guided into other channels of thought.\r\n\r\nThey were all perfectly delighted when Marian taught them how to stay\r\nunder water as long as they pleased. On one of their inland trips they\r\nhad found some large hollow weed-stalks. They played with them at first\r\nby simply blowing bubbles in the water and drawing up mouthfuls of\r\nwater which they blew out at each other, but when Marian showed them\r\nthat by holding one of the hollow tubes in the mouth one could stay\r\nunder water as long as he remembered to breathe always through the\r\nmouth and to keep the top of the tube above the water, they invented\r\nall kinds of games that the new trick could be used in.\r\n\r\nDelbert could do it best. He declared he could lie under the water and\r\ngo to sleep, it was so easy. Marian did not advise him to try it. “You\r\nmight get to snoring and drown before you could wake up,” she told him.\r\n\r\nTheir novel clothing gave new impetus to their Indian play. There was\r\nsome discussion at first as to which tribe they belonged to. They\r\ncould not seem to recognize themselves as belonging to any they had yet\r\nheard of and they finally invented a new one and called themselves the\r\ntribe of the Hawks. Marian had been calling Delbert that for some time,\r\nhe was always so keenly on the alert for anything to eat. And when he\r\nperched himself on a rock and fished patiently,--that was before they\r\nlost the hook,--he reminded her of nothing so much as a fish hawk ready\r\nto swoop.\r\n\r\nThey spent more and more time on the trips inland. They began to skirt\r\nthe hills a little. Davie was so big now that he did not seem to tire\r\nout any quicker than Jennie, and the little feet were all so tough that\r\nhard roads did not daunt them.\r\n\r\nThey saw no more cat-tracks, but Marian never forgot that one, and\r\nbecause of it kept the tribe away from the high rocky hills and the\r\nthick growth.\r\n\r\nThe country beyond the largest _estero_ became familiar to them for\r\nseveral miles. There was a certain lagoon there that they liked to go\r\nto in the rainy season,--and there was no lagoon there except in the\r\nrainy season. There were beautiful blue pond-lilies in it. Marian dug\r\nup some roots and planted them on the home Island.\r\n\r\nThey frequently found arrowheads and sometimes other stones, broken,\r\nbut showing the work of human hands upon them, all of which spoke\r\nwith certainty of bygone people, but never anything of modern times.\r\nNear the lagoon were several low hills, and on these they found the\r\ncotton-tree. This tree in its season produces big pods full of silky\r\nwhite cotton, and though the yield is not so very abundant, nor the\r\nquality so very fine, yet they saved every pod they could find, Delbert\r\nand Esther often climbing up for those that could not be reached from\r\nthe ground with a pole.\r\n\r\n“Some day I will invent a spinning-wheel and a loom,” said Marian, “and\r\nwe will make cloth.” And the children, remembering the rope-making\r\nmachine she had made, never doubted her ability.\r\n\r\nOnce, when they were about two miles from the end of the _estero_, they\r\nfound a good-sized tree that had blown down some years before on the\r\nside of a little hill. It was larger than any tree growing there now\r\nand seemed to have been alone among its dwarfish neighbors. It was too\r\nheavy to be dragged all that distance, but if they could manage to chop\r\noff the few limbs and the roots that stuck up so high, they could roll\r\nit down to the _estero_ and float it home.\r\n\r\nIt was a big task, but because they had plenty of time on their hands\r\nand no pressing social duties, and also because they needed that log\r\nin their business, they made trip after trip, starting at daylight and\r\nnot getting home till nearly dark, chopped and chopped with the hatchet\r\nuntil they had the log smooth enough to roll, and then rolled it over\r\nand over all that distance and floated it home in triumph.\r\n\r\nThen they set about improving the raft. The new log was a little\r\ncrooked, but otherwise was about the equal of the one they had captured\r\nout in the bay. The three logs together would be much better than the\r\nraft as it was. Delbert’s idea was to lash them together as they had\r\nbeen doing, but Marian had thought of an improvement, though it almost\r\nseemed as if it could not be done with their limited facilities. They\r\nhad already accomplished so many tasks that seemed hard, however, and\r\nDelbert was such a bright and willing helper, and the little girls were\r\nalways so willing to contribute their share to any labor, that she told\r\nDelbert that at any rate they would have a try at shipbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHOPPED AND CHOPPED UNTIL THEY HAD THE LOG SMOOTH ENOUGH\r\nTO ROLL]\r\n\r\nLong and longingly she looked at the old canoe, but in the end left it\r\nwhere it was in the corral fence. She could think of no way to combine\r\nit with the logs to make a more serviceable craft.\r\n\r\nThe new log was rolled up on the beach beside the one they had found\r\nout on the water, and then the raft was taken to pieces, and the log\r\nin the middle of it was also rolled up on the beach. After they were\r\nall fixed in just the right position, they were kept in place by stakes\r\ndriven into the ground.\r\n\r\nThe next thing was to make a new tool. Among the scraps of iron found\r\non the little egg island was one about an inch in diameter and nearly\r\nthree feet long when straightened out. It was round, an immense bolt\r\nmaybe, but rusted and bent and twisted. What Marian did first was to\r\nheat it to straighten it out.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard to handle it when it was hot. She had an assortment of\r\ngreen sticks and matted-fiber holders for this purpose. As when they\r\nwere making the fish-spear, they used a flat rock for an anvil and the\r\nhatchet for a hammer, and after many heatings and hammerings they got\r\nthe iron straight with a blunt point on one end.\r\n\r\nBut straightening the bar was only the beginning of the work. She kept\r\nthe fire hot and heated the bar time after time, and burned three holes\r\nentirely through the two outside logs and corresponding ones well into\r\nthe middle log. Then they took six of the toughest stakes they could\r\nfind, whittled them straight and smooth to the right size, and drove\r\nthem in through the burned holes like huge nails. Next they burned and\r\nwhittled a big hole down into the center log as a socket for the mast.\r\nThen they picked out the best of the poles that had been in the raft\r\nand set it in place and drove in wedges to hold it solid. This got rid\r\nof the clumsy lashings and proppings, besides giving them a straight\r\ninstead of a crooked mast, and it was not difficult then to rig up a\r\nsail that could be easily raised and lowered, using, of course, one of\r\nthe blankets for a sail as before.\r\n\r\nThe platform that they burned their _pitalla_ on when spearing next\r\ndemanded their attention. It was too clumsy and was always needing\r\nrepairs. Once out on the salt reef they had found a dead sea turtle\r\nhalf buried in the sand. They had fished it out and fastened it with\r\nstakes where it would not be washed away, though every tide would\r\ncover it, and the elements combined with the scavengers of the sea to\r\nclean the shell for them. With rocks and the hatchet they broke away\r\nthe under part of the shell, and the top part, about two and a half\r\nfeet in diameter, curved and dished, would hold the _pitalla_ nicely.\r\n\r\nTwo stout, widespread crotches were cut and driven tightly into burned\r\nholes at one end of the projecting middle log, so that they supported\r\nthe inverted turtle-shell. It did not, however, rest firmly enough\r\ntill Marian had wired it to the crotches by means of the bail from the\r\nold wooden bucket, which was passed through little holes burned in the\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nAway off up in the pasture they had found a place where the soil\r\npartook of the nature of clay. They brought some from there, mixed it\r\nto the right consistency and spread a coating all over the inside of\r\nthe turtle-shell. It dried without much cracking, and the fire would\r\nharden it. This was a vast improvement over the old platform, which, in\r\nspite of their best efforts had always been a trifle wobbly and evinced\r\na tendency to spill the fuel off into the water at the slightest\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nDelbert thought they had their task about finished now, but Marian had\r\na great deal more to do to it still. She wanted to build on the other\r\nend a platform of some sort, where they could put things and have them\r\nstay dry. By burning holes and driving in stakes and then weaving in\r\nwith small, tough green sticks, she succeeded in making that end of the\r\nraft look not unlike a huge basket. Then by filling that same basket\r\nwith dried seaweed and such material, which was bulky but light, she\r\nhad a place where things could be carried out of reach of the waves and\r\nwhere a little girl could lie down if she was tired. Of course, the\r\nwaves slopped up and soaked through the seaweed to some extent when the\r\nraft was in use, but when it was moored quietly to the beach the hot\r\nsun dried it out pretty well.\r\n\r\nWhen the raft was finished, their third rainy season on the island was\r\npast. Marian was learning, and the others along with her, something of\r\nthe eternal patience of the universe. So long as she was accomplishing\r\nher purpose, she did not count much on the time it took to do it.\r\n\r\nThey all thought the new raft was such a beauty that it deserved a\r\nname. Marian suggested everything she could think of from “Fleet Wings”\r\nto “Annabel Lee,” but they finally decided on Jennie’s choice, which\r\nwas “Muggywah.” She said it was Indian and meant something very safe\r\nand strong that nobody could conquer. Where she got the name or the\r\nnotion Marian could not imagine, and she herself could not tell, but\r\nthe Muggywah became one of the family forthwith.\r\n\r\nOut where the center log projected, at the turtle-shell end, Marian\r\nburned the name. “Oh, we are getting wonderfully aristocratic,” she\r\ntold the children. “It is not every family that can have their own\r\nprivate yacht.”\r\n\r\nThey went on a big spearing expedition when the Muggywah was finished.\r\nThe tide was just right, and the fish were plentiful. They got three\r\nenormous red snappers and a lot of smaller fry, and it was the most\r\nsatisfactory trip they had ever made.\r\n\r\nMarian sat Turk-fashion on the seaweed deck and steered with the broken\r\noar, which had been spliced to make it better to handle, and Davie\r\nwas in front of her, dry and warm. When he went to sleep, it was the\r\neasiest thing in the world to tie him safely, for some of the stakes of\r\nthe basketwork had been left high for that especial purpose, and then\r\nhe did not have to be watched.\r\n\r\nJennie took the spear first, and when, after a while, she grew tired\r\nand gave the spear to Esther, who had been teasing for it, she too\r\ncrept back and crawled in with Davie under the shawls and lay on her\r\nback, watching the bright stars above and the mango bushes, weird and\r\ngrotesque with the flare of the _pitalla_ fire and the backward swirl\r\nof the smoke. When the game became an old story to Esther, she yielded\r\nthe spear to Delbert, and, after replenishing the fire from the fuel in\r\nthe barrel, she too curled down on the deck at Jennie’s feet.\r\n\r\nDelbert and Marian then took turns at steering and spearing, and only\r\nturned the Muggywah back toward the pier when the fuel was all gone.\r\n\r\nAlong with their feathers the children took up other modes of Indian\r\ndecoration of their persons. They did not quite come to war paint, but\r\nthey wore long strings of beads, principally of the _guaymuchel_ seeds.\r\nThese are flat black seeds that grow embedded in a thick sweetish pith\r\nenclosed in a pod which grows on a big tree. The pithy part is highly\r\nprized by the Indians for eating, and the Island Hawks gathered them\r\nfor that, and saved the seeds, which, when soft, are easily strung.\r\n\r\nThen there were the tiny many-colored clamshells that they found so\r\nplentiful on the beaches of the bird islands. They bored holes in these\r\nwith Marian’s big fat darning-needle and strung them into valuable\r\nwampum belts. There were other seeds and beans that they strung, but\r\nthese were the staples.\r\n\r\nOne Christmas, Marian gave Jennie a string of bone beads. She had found\r\na number of the bones of some big bird, long, smooth, and hollow, and\r\nshe whittled them into little sections and strung them on a string of\r\nher own hair. That same year her gift to Esther was a headdress of\r\npink feathers taken from a dead bird that Delbert had found washed up\r\non the beach one morning. To Delbert she gave a gay feather-trimmed\r\nquiver for his arrows and two new arrow-points of bone, and to Davie\r\na number of little toys whittled out of driftwood. The children had\r\nremembered their kindergarten lore that year, and each one made Marian\r\na little basket. They were rather loose and ill-shapen, but they were\r\nthe forerunners of better ones.\r\n\r\nWith the Muggywah their food problem was still further simplified.\r\nThey had lived so long on the Island now that they knew the tides,\r\nwhen they would be high and when low, and always took these into\r\nconsideration along with the wind. With their gay striped blanket for a\r\nsail and a paddle of some sort in the hands of each, with their trips\r\nplanned to have the tide in their favor as much as possible, they\r\ncould accomplish much more business than formerly. They could take a\r\ndishpanful of boiled-down sea-water out to the salt reef, put it into\r\nthe rock-hollows there, where the sun finished the evaporation for\r\nthem, and maybe gather up a dish of dry and quite passably clean salt\r\nto take back with them; go on to some other place and gather a lot of\r\nclams for dinner, or perhaps oysters; go back again to Smugglers’,\r\nput up the salt and attend to the clams, and strike off across the\r\nbay toward some distant _estero_, which would lead back into good\r\n_pitalla_ country, or perhaps to a _panal_ which they had seen some\r\ndays before and been too busy to gather in; and by night they would\r\nhave accomplished several times as much as when they had crept over\r\nthe water on the old log with only driftwood and poles for paddles, or\r\nelse had had to stay on land because the water was a little rough. With\r\nthe new firm mast which was in no danger of falling down, they could\r\nutilize a wind that had been much too strong for them to tamper with\r\nbefore, and with the children able to swim like little fishes, they\r\ncould brave a possible capsize or tumble overboard. Of course Marian\r\nwas not going to risk the great waves outside in the Gulf, and when the\r\nwind blew the water into breakers on the Island, white and thunderous,\r\nshe kept her tribe busy in the pasture or the garden.\r\n\r\nSome time during each day they took their bath and swim. If the water\r\nwas too rough on the seaward side, they took it in the harbor, where\r\nit was quieter, but there were not so very many days when it was too\r\nrough. Marian would keep her eye on Davie if they were out very far,\r\nbut she had little anxiety about the others. Sometimes they took the\r\nMuggywah out into deep water and anchored her with a stone, and had\r\ntheir swim from there.\r\n\r\nThey had had no storm yet equal to the one on the night of their\r\narrival on the Island, but during the fall after the Muggywah was\r\nfinished they had one which came nearer to it than any in the three\r\nyears. It lasted two days and two nights and certainly gave them a\r\nmiserable time. They turned the little burros out with their mothers\r\nto save feeding and milking, and they collected vegetables and bananas\r\nin the Cave, which they ate raw, not being able to have a fire to cook\r\nby. Indeed, their precious embers were all put out, so that they had to\r\nstart anew with the fire-sticks when the storm was over.\r\n\r\nThey snuggled up in the Cave, not going out except when it seemed\r\nabsolutely necessary, and Marian sang over all the songs she knew and\r\nwhich she had sung to them on rainy days a hundred times before,--or at\r\nleast it seemed so to her,--and told over all the stories they called\r\nfor and racked her brains for new ones.\r\n\r\nThe Cave had never been a roomy chamber, and now it reminded Marian of\r\na nest that is filled to overflowing with nestlings which are ready to\r\nfly. Neither of the little girls could stand up in it now, not even in\r\nthe widest part, and Davie, fast growing up into a big, strong boy, had\r\nto be very careful.\r\n\r\nThe first day dragged, the second crawled, and in the afternoon Marian\r\ndelivered herself of the emphatic remark, “We are not going to live in\r\nthis Cave through another rainy season; we will build us a house!”\r\n\r\nThe children were all struck dumb for a second and then fired volleys\r\nof comments and questions.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Marian when quiet reigned again, “this Cave was all\r\nright in the first place. You were all little then, and it was the\r\nbest we could do, but now,--why, see! Delbert is stretching up nearly\r\nas tall as I am; Jennie and Esther take up as much room as all four of\r\nyou did then; we spread out so we can’t keep ourselves covered from the\r\nmosquitoes; and I am sick and tired of camping out forever; I want a\r\nhome.”\r\n\r\n“But, Marian,” said Jennie, “don’t you think some one will find us now\r\nbefore long?”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Marian, “that there is no likelihood of any one but\r\nIndians coming into San Moros. There is nothing to bring any one else\r\nhere, and, as you know, we have seen very few canoes in all the time we\r\nhave been here. I don’t understand it; it seems as if they would all\r\nknow about there being bananas and good water here and be coming all\r\nthe time, but evidently there are no settlements anywhere near, and the\r\npoor Indian is not going very far from home in his canoe. Clarence must\r\nhave found out about the place from some old Indian who, I suppose, had\r\nhappened to stumble on to it somehow, and, as far as I know, Clarence\r\nwas the only white person who ever came here, but”--she paused and\r\nlooked impressively at the children--“some day, when we can sail the\r\nMuggywah a great deal better than we do now, when Davie is big and\r\nstrong enough so that I dare risk him out there on the Gulf waves, and\r\nwhen the rest of you are bigger and stronger than you are now, we’ll\r\nstock the Muggywah up with provisions and we’ll go back to the Port\r\nourselves. I don’t dare risk it overland and I shall not try it by\r\nwater so long as there is any risk in it, but if no one comes for us\r\nbefore then, the time will come when you children will be so big that\r\nwe can go in safety, and then we’ll go.”\r\n\r\n“I’d be willing to take some risk,” said Delbert moodily.\r\n\r\n“I’m not,” said Marian. “Four children mother left in my care when she\r\nwent to Guaymas that time, four I shall return to her. Your lives are\r\nsafe here. If I lost one of you in trying to get back, I should never\r\nbe happy again.”\r\n\r\n“How well shall we have to swim?” asked Esther.\r\n\r\n“Better than any of us do now,” said Marian. “We must be able to swim\r\nso well that if the Muggywah should swamp or turn turtle out there, we\r\ncould all get to shore if we had to. It is a good deal, but we can do\r\nit in time. Clarence could have done it, but it may take us several\r\nyears yet. We don’t dare go out of the bay yet, and we all get tired\r\nout if we have much hard paddling to do; but to go to the Port in the\r\nMuggywah would take several days. Unfortunately, she doesn’t go as\r\nswiftly as the launch did.”\r\n\r\n“If Clarence was here, he’d make her go better than she does,” said\r\nDelbert.\r\n\r\n“I think he would,” returned Marian; “but what we don’t know about\r\nsailing her we must learn; and meantime, I am tired of living in this\r\nlittle hole in the rocks, and the next job on hand is to build a house.\r\nWe can do it.”\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do usually is to select a site. Esther thought a\r\ngood place to put the new dwelling in would be down by the pier, where\r\nthe smugglers had had their house. It would be close to the water and\r\nthe garden. But that took them out of sight of the bay and the distant\r\nGulf, and mosquitoes and gnats were apt to be plentiful there at night,\r\nand so it was not to be thought of. Jennie, too, still retained her\r\nfear of the water during storms, and the higher they could get the\r\nbetter it would suit her. One thing about the Cave which they meant to\r\nimprove upon in their new habitation was the fact that their view was\r\ncut off by the big rock in front. To see what might be out on the water\r\nthey had to go clear past it, out of the house, as one might say. Of\r\ncourse, it sheltered them from wind and rain to a great extent, but\r\nMarian wanted to be sheltered from the elements and still be able to\r\nsee out on the water.\r\n\r\nFrom the mound that had been the smugglers’ house projected a crotched\r\ntimber, and Marian suggested that they dig it out for their new\r\ndwelling, though she had not yet decided where to build nor what\r\nmaterial to use.\r\n\r\nThey made some wooden rakes and shovels,--that is, they called them\r\nthat,--and these did a little better for the work than the old\r\ndig-spoon and the little spade. As they dug and scraped, Marian told\r\nthem of the ancient cities which lay buried for centuries and then\r\nwere sometimes discovered and excavated and of the wonderful things\r\nfound in them. The children were very much interested, and straightway\r\nthey ceased to be Indians and became a band of eminent scientists\r\nwho had discovered an ancient, oh, a very ancient, city. It was very\r\ninteresting indeed, for, when you came to think of it, there was really\r\nno knowing what you might or might not find.\r\n\r\nThey finally got the timber out. It was shorter than Marian had hoped,\r\nbut then the children wanted to go on and dig the whole mound over.\r\nThey had found a few bits of broken pottery, which they seemed to think\r\nvery wonderful, and they hoped for more riches.\r\n\r\nSo, as it seemed a pity to veto anything so exciting, Marian consented\r\nto go on with the work. It seemed almost strange that they did not\r\nfind more things than they did. There were a number of other timbers\r\nunearthed, but all but one of them were too rotten to be of use. There\r\nwas the half of a _metate_ stone[5] which they made a great deal of\r\nuse of afterwards, and a broken pitcher and more pieces of pottery,\r\nbut none of it big enough to be of any use. There were some very small\r\nfragments of glass and quite a number of bricks; also a few rusty\r\nscraps of iron, one of which had been an oarlock and one a knife. The\r\nbricks were mixed in with a number of stones, all bearing the marks of\r\nfire,--a cooking-place of some sort evidently.\r\n\r\n  [5] A stone used for grinding Indian corn.\r\n\r\nThe children were most excited over the pitcher. It had a gay flower\r\non one side of it, and they watched eagerly for other fragments. They\r\nfound a few and fitted them together, but when all was done there was\r\nstill a hole in it as big as Delbert’s fist and a piece gone from the\r\nnose, but they took as much pride in that old fragment as if it had\r\nbeen really something valuable.\r\n\r\nBut to Marian the bricks appealed the most. She meant to have a real\r\nfireplace in the new house, and they would aid very much. The crotched\r\ntimber, short though it was, would also come in very handy, and the\r\nground they had dug over so industriously was in fine condition for a\r\ngarden.\r\n\r\nEvery day they took their swimming-lesson. Now they began to practice\r\non long swims. They would take the Muggywah out, and while Marian or\r\nDelbert paddled it along, or tended the sail if there was a breeze, the\r\nrest would swim by the side. As soon as one got tired, all he had to\r\ndo was to climb in and take his turn with the paddle. Even Davie was\r\nlearning a little about paddling, and Jennie and Esther, now eleven and\r\nnine years old, could manage very nicely.\r\n\r\nOut on the blue water they made a pretty picture,--the Muggywah dancing\r\nalong with her gay striped sail, Marian in a garment constructed of\r\nher old brown petticoat which reached to her knees but left neck and\r\narms bare, Davie’s old straw hat tied under her chin, her long braids\r\nfalling to her waist as she steered with the oar; the four children,\r\ntheir slender bodies gleaming white in the water, splashing each other,\r\nlaughing, calling, now and again climbing on the seaweed deck to rest a\r\nfew minutes before plunging down again into the salty waves.\r\n\r\nAnd when they had been out long enough, they would turn the Muggywah\r\nand run for Smugglers’, pretending they were fleeing from their\r\nenemies,--smugglers escaping from the government revenue men maybe, or\r\nIndians returning from striking some decisive blow at their tribal foes.\r\n\r\nAlways there were the little burros to be tended, a little gardening to\r\nbe done each day, fresh water to be carried up to the Cave, and wood to\r\nbe gathered. Marian had learned that as long as she worked with them\r\nher tribe did very well, but it was not well to leave them at separate\r\ntasks. She still felt, too, the desire to have them within her reach,\r\nto know for a certainty where each one was and that he or she was\r\nsafe. So they fished together, gathered wood together, worked together\r\nin the garden.\r\n\r\nDelbert sometimes went to the pasture alone when Marian was busy with\r\nsomething else, yet as a rule he took Esther with him even there.\r\nJennie was more apt to stay with Marian, to help with the cooking, or\r\nmaybe just to sit on the rocks gazing out over the sea. As for Davie,\r\nhe stayed with Marian too. Delbert never wanted him along when he was\r\nafter game, for the little fellow was sure to make some sort of a\r\nnoise at the wrong time, which Delbert always found hard to forgive,\r\nwhile Esther, on the other hand, would follow at his heels like a\r\nwell-trained dog, moving silently, stealthily, and her aim was nearly\r\nequal to his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING OF THE WICKIUP\r\n\r\n\r\nDelbert came laughing to his breakfast one morning. “I’ve found the\r\nideal spot for a house,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Good for you!” said Marian, as she carefully raked out from the embers\r\nthe red snapper which had been stuffed with green peppers, wrapped in\r\ngreen banana leaves, and buried in the hot coals and ashes overnight.\r\n“All right, tell us about it as we eat.”\r\n\r\n“It can’t be told. It will have to be seen to be appreciated,” he said.\r\n\r\n“In that case we will go and see right after breakfast.”\r\n\r\nWhich they did, and he led them to the highest, rockiest point of that\r\nend of the Island, facing the long, sandy point where the watermelons\r\nwere and where one could see both the bay and the harbor.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said he, seating himself on a big boulder, “you observe the\r\nlovely view we have. Nowhere on the whole Island can you get a better\r\none. With a little clearing there is a fair chance of a path down to\r\nthe pier. We are not so very far from the Cave either. And then, too,\r\nyou see, this nice high cliff would save our making more than three\r\nsides to the house, and those big rocks there would be handy to brace\r\nagainst.”\r\n\r\n“Where would be our floor?” asked Jennie. “It’s all rocks here.”\r\n\r\nBut Marian was looking. The cliff, as Delbert called it, would save\r\nmaking one side of the house, and several of the big rocks Jennie was\r\nso scornful of were in a direct line for working into the walls, while\r\nthe others could be moved by means of crude levers that they could\r\nwork. The floor could then be leveled by building up with rocks from\r\nthe lower side. It would be impossible to dig holes to set posts in,\r\nbut, if one were not too particular about having the house symmetrical,\r\nthere were several fissures in the rocks where posts could be put, and\r\nbraced solid with other stones packed in about them. The face of the\r\nbig rock, or cliff, back of them was very irregular, and there were\r\nseveral good places to set roof-timbers in.\r\n\r\nThe ground sloped rather steeply down to the sandy point and was\r\ncovered with brush, but a path, as Delbert said, could be cleared down\r\nto the pier, and it would be a better one really than the one they were\r\nusing, too. Also a little tossing of the rocks to one side would clear\r\nthe way back to the Cave, where they could use the old path to the\r\nbeach. The heavy task would be bringing all the material up the hill,\r\nbut that would have to be done in any case; only, of course, if they\r\nbuilt at the Cave, for instance, they would not have to carry things so\r\nfar.\r\n\r\n“Delbert,” she said, “what we are going to need, and need badly, is\r\nlime.”\r\n\r\n“Lime? What for?”\r\n\r\n“To mix with sand and fresh water to make mortar to pack around the\r\nroof-timbers, where we set them into the cliff there, and around the\r\nposts, where we put them into this crevice below. Good mortar would set\r\nand keep them solid.”\r\n\r\n“They dig lime out of the ground, don’t they?”\r\n\r\n“No; they dig a certain kind of rock out and burn it, and it turns into\r\nlime; and they burn shells, and that makes lime too.”\r\n\r\n“Shells? Well, we can get plenty of shells.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but I don’t know how to burn lime,--how long it takes or how it\r\nought to look when it is right,--and I don’t know exactly how to work\r\nit afterwards either.”\r\n\r\n“Can’t we experiment and find out? Burn just a few at first and see how\r\nthey work?”\r\n\r\n“I guess we’d better, for I don’t want this house falling down on us in\r\na storm, and if I can get the frame of it absolutely solid, I’ll risk\r\nbut what we can manage the rest of it all right.”\r\n\r\n“What will you make the roof of?” asked Jennie.\r\n\r\n“Thatch,” promptly responded Marian. “Don’t you remember all that tall\r\nthatch grass out beyond the lagoon? The Mexicans at the Port sometimes\r\nmake their whole houses of it. And, Delbert, there is another big job\r\nahead of us. We are going to need every pole that is in the corral\r\nfence; we must build a good brush fence to hold in the burros, so that\r\nwe can have every stick and pole there, every piece of driftwood. I\r\nguess we’d better clear that patch of brush beyond the garden. It will\r\nbe nicer cleared away, and we can pile it all on to the fence.”\r\n\r\nThey gathered a lot of shells that day, and, after a few experiments\r\nin their cooking-fire, made a little pile of alternate shells and wood\r\nand started it burning. Marian thought the shells ought probably to\r\nburn slowly; her idea was to rake out a few every now and then and see\r\nhow things were going. Her only safe way was to mix a little mortar and\r\nsee if it set hard.\r\n\r\nBetween times they worked on the brush fence. They had not progressed\r\nvery far before they wished they had got at it at least two years\r\nsooner, for in the midst of the tangled growth of bushes, choked and\r\nstunted but still struggling to keep alive, they found a goodly number\r\nof cotton plants.\r\n\r\nThese must have been, along with the palms and the bananas, a part of\r\nthe smugglers’ garden. There were three straggling rows, and most of\r\nthe bushes had a few sickly-looking cotton bolls on them. They are\r\nnever very large on that particular variety of plant, but none of these\r\nwere larger than a small hen’s egg; indeed, most of them more closely\r\nresembled marbles. But they contained actual cotton, and with care and\r\nsome cultivation the plants would produce more and larger bolls. They\r\ngathered them--what few there were--and put them with the cotton-tree\r\npods.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the house is done, I shall have to see about a\r\nspinning-wheel and loom,” said Marian, “and oh! if we had only found\r\nthem before!”\r\n\r\nThey cut out the brush systematically, clearing out, as thoroughly as\r\nthey could, each bush as they came to it. Delbert and the little girls\r\nwould take sticks and bend back the bushes, so that Marian could get at\r\nthem to chop them off near the ground with the hatchet; then with ropes\r\nthey would drag them to the corral and pile them on the fence. They\r\nwere trying to make it very solid and compact, also a little larger\r\nthan before.\r\n\r\nIn this way they managed to release every pole that had been in the\r\nfence, and they piled them at one side to await the time when they\r\nshould be ready for them at the new house.\r\n\r\nThey were not so very successful with the lime. They burned a good many\r\nshells before they produced what was at all satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThey found that there were not enough shells near by, but off across\r\nthe bay, at the mouth of one of the _esteros_, was a bank that had\r\nseemed to be composed almost entirely of shells; so they took the\r\nMuggywah and made several trips there, coming back loaded down with all\r\nthe shells they could carry. These shells were very old and broken,\r\nbut Marian thought they would probably make as good lime as fresh ones\r\nwould. There were other places, too, where shells were more plentiful\r\nthan near home, and they made trips after them.\r\n\r\nWhile they were gathering the shells they cut a good many _pitalla_\r\npoles, peeled the green bark off them, and left them to dry before\r\ntaking them home. Delbert used his stone hatchet for that work; he had\r\nmade a handle for it, as Marian said probably the first owner had, by\r\nsplitting a stick down and tying it above and below where the hatchet\r\nwas inserted, and while he could not, of course, chop wood with it, the\r\nsoft green _pitalla_ bark yielded to it very well. To be sure, it was\r\nno better, even for this purpose, than the other hatchet, but think how\r\nmuch more romantic it is to work with an ancient stone hatchet than\r\nwith an ordinary little modern steel one!\r\n\r\nDelbert thought so much of that hatchet that Marian said he had better\r\ngive it a name, and told him about King Arthur’s sword Excalibur; but\r\nwhen Delbert asked her if she thought that would be a good name for the\r\nhatchet, she said she thought they had better modify it a little and\r\ncall it the “Exscalper” instead, because, though it might once have\r\nbeen used to scalp with, it was not in that business now.\r\n\r\nThese _pitalla_ poles are hollow, but durable and comparatively\r\nstraight, and are much used in building the humbler homes of western\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXSCALPER]\r\n\r\nThe poor little overworked hatchet had to be sharpened many, many\r\ntimes. There was no need now to put the whetstone beyond Davie’s reach.\r\nHe was too sensible to want to hide it, realizing as well as any of\r\nthem that what the whole community needs should not be selfishly\r\nregarded as private property.\r\n\r\nDelbert’s jack-knife had been worked and overworked till it was about\r\nused up. One blade was broken, and the other leaned backward in a\r\nmost heartrending fashion. He did not use it much, but always had the\r\nbutcher-knife tucked into his belt beside the Exscalper.\r\n\r\nThe two case-knives had been sharpened, and the two little girls\r\ncarried them. Davie never felt at home without the dig-spoon. With much\r\nuse its edge had become as sharp as a knife, and he used it for that\r\nright along. And he, like all the others, except Marian, always had his\r\nbow and arrows slung at his back.\r\n\r\nThey did not take much time off the work till the season for “duck”\r\neggs came again; then they dropped everything and sailed for the\r\nlittle white islands. It took only a part of a day to make the trip,\r\nand they could get eggs enough for several days. They almost lived on\r\nthem through the season, and when it was over dropped back to their\r\nvegetarian diet, varied only by an occasional meal of fish from a\r\nnight’s spearing.\r\n\r\nWhen, after much time and labor expended, and many, many experiments,\r\nMarian decided that there was enough lime to make the mortar to set\r\nthe posts and roof-timbers, they began the task of getting their\r\ntimbers up the hill.\r\n\r\nThey had thought that they could utilize Jackie for that, but he soon\r\nundeceived them. He was not averse to carrying small loads of wood, but\r\nwhen it came to pulling anything really heavy, Jackie called a halt,\r\nand, moreover, remained halted till the load was removed.\r\n\r\nThey found no means of coaxing or persuasion that availed in the\r\nleast. It made not an iota of difference to Jackie whether those poles\r\nremained at the top or the bottom of the hill, and if the children\r\nwanted them at the top, why, let them take them there, that was all. In\r\nthe end they had to drag them up themselves. They tied ropes to them\r\nand used main force. It was not a very long job when they once got over\r\ntrying to make Jackie do it for them. As for him, he skipped along\r\nbeside them, gay and carefree.\r\n\r\nThen they debated long and earnestly as to just which crotched timber\r\nshould be placed in this place and which pole in that. They tried each\r\none in all the places to see where it would fit best, and everybody\r\nexpressed his opinion. They planned where to put the doors and the\r\nwindow, and where was the best place for the fireplace.\r\n\r\nWhen they had these momentous questions settled, Marian mixed her\r\nmortar. Each upright was made solid by being packed tightly with big\r\nrocks and all set in mortar; each roof-pole was set in the same way\r\nwhere it rested on the cliff. At the same time Marian tried not to be\r\ntoo prodigal with her mortar, for she wanted to have enough left to\r\nlay up the chimney, at least where it would come above the roof and be\r\nexposed to the wind and weather. And her supply of lime was not at all\r\nlarge, for it took so long to gather up the shells, and often they had\r\nnot got them well burned after they were gathered.\r\n\r\nAfter her timbers and poles were well set, she began on the fireplace.\r\nFor this they brought up the bricks and the blackened stones from the\r\nsmugglers’ old house; for some kinds of stones will crack and split\r\nwith heat, or even go so far as to pop into little pieces which fly\r\nin all directions, and Marian wanted that fireplace built of tested\r\nstones that would be up to no mischief. The stones she had cooked over\r\nat the Cave were brought, and two nice, smooth, large ones from the\r\ncooking-place at the beach. She used clay from the pasture as mortar\r\nfor the fireplace and the lower part of the chimney.\r\n\r\nOnce, on a trip up an _estero_ that wound past a little hill, they\r\nhad noticed a big flat rock that Delbert thought would make a fine\r\nhearthstone. They could find other flat rocks, of course, but this\r\none had especially appealed to the boy, because it was much larger\r\nand smoother than any other they had seen, and he thought it would be\r\nnice to have the hearth of one big stone. Marian thought so, too, but\r\nwas afraid it was too big for them to manage. However, she finally\r\nconsented to try it. If they could get it on board the Muggywah at all,\r\nthey could find some way of getting it off again and up the hill and\r\ninto place.\r\n\r\nAfter all, thought Marian, if her flock learned to achieve things, to\r\novercome difficulties, to persist in spite of obstacles, was that not\r\nof itself a fair education? And to bring that great rock home would\r\ncertainly be a lesson in achievement.\r\n\r\nSo they went after it. They took plenty of ropes along and several\r\nround pieces of driftwood to serve as rollers under the stone. They\r\nfound it readily. One side was so flat and smooth that it seemed as if\r\nit must some time have been worked upon by human hands; the other was\r\nrough and irregular, being much thicker at one end than at the other.\r\nIt was all Marian and Delbert could do to lift it alone, and even with\r\nJennie’s and Esther’s help it was none too easy. Fortunately it was not\r\nfar from the water’s edge. They got it on their two largest rollers,\r\nand, by smoothing the way and prying the rollers along, they got it\r\ndown to the Muggywah.\r\n\r\nThen it developed that it would be more easily got aboard at low than\r\nat high tide. At low tide the Muggywah could be placed under a bank and\r\nthe big stone swung off on to her; at high tide it would have to be\r\nlifted up to get it aboard.\r\n\r\nSo they made their preparations. They tied the Muggywah fore and aft,\r\nand rigged up a tripod to assist in swinging the hearthstone over on to\r\nher just where they wanted it. They pushed and pried the rollers, and\r\ntugged and twisted till they had the big stone in position on the edge\r\nof the bank, and then retired to the shade of a scrubby mesquite to\r\neat their lunch of turnips and carrots and drink Island water from the\r\nbottles, while they waited for the tide to go out.\r\n\r\nAnd when the lunch was finished, they sallied forth and hunted for\r\n_panales_, clams, oysters, and, incidentally, arrowheads and more\r\nhatchets.\r\n\r\nWhen the Muggywah dropped below the bank, they rallied again to the\r\ntask in hand. The tripod was a big help; they had the hair rope for\r\nthat. Carefully they worked. It was not merely the getting of the big\r\nstone that Marian had in mind; she wanted to be quite sure no one was\r\ngoing to get hurt in the process.\r\n\r\n“Delbert, don’t lift on that till you really strain yourself,” she\r\nsaid. “Davie, you stand by that pole and see that it doesn’t lift up;\r\nI don’t want your little fingers mashed under this. Esther, poke that\r\nstick under there where Jennie’s fingers are. There, that’s right;\r\nthat holds it instead. Now, Jennie, you stand there where Delbert is.\r\nDelbert, you and I will have to swing round below here now. Davie, hold\r\nthat pole down tight.”\r\n\r\nDavie held valiantly with all his might. There was no danger of that\r\nparticular pole budging, but Marian wanted him out of the way, and knew\r\nthat the only way to be sure he would not slip in at the wrong minute,\r\nand maybe get a finger jammed before she could help him, was to keep\r\nhim busy elsewhere.\r\n\r\n“There, now, you see, part of the weight comes on the tripod. Carefully\r\nnow, Esther. Jennie can do that alone now; you jump down and be ready\r\nto help here.”\r\n\r\nIn the midst of it all she began to laugh. “Delbert, if it takes all\r\nthis fuss to get it aboard, how in the world are we ever going to get\r\nit off again? We may have to dump it into the harbor yet.”\r\n\r\n“Not much we don’t,” muttered Delbert between his teeth.\r\n\r\n“Well, all steady now! Gently there, Jennie! That’s right! Now jump\r\ndown and help Esther. There, there she is, neat as a whistle. Look how\r\nit pushes the Muggywah down, but it’s all right. Knock up that tripod\r\npole there, Delbert. We’ll have the rope off. Where did you put your\r\noysters, Jennie? Oh, I see. Well, drop ’em in here; we must be starting\r\nback. It will take us all day to-morrow to get this hearthstone off the\r\ndeck, and two more to get it up the hill, as like as not.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it took a great deal longer than that, but they\r\ndid not work at it all the time. They rigged up another tripod to\r\nhelp them swing it off the Muggywah, and by aid of rollers got it to\r\nthe foot of the hill safely. There they tied it to something to make\r\nsure it would not slip and roll down on them, and little by little, as\r\nthey felt inclined, they pushed it up the hill. Sometimes a day or two\r\nwould go by without its being touched, and then, some morning when they\r\nfelt vigorous, they would get at it with levers and rollers and work it\r\nup the hill a little farther. Davie got quite expert in slipping the\r\nstones in back of it to block it up while they rested.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time it was taken into the frame of the new house and\r\nsettled into place, being blocked with stones till it did not wiggle in\r\nthe least; and as they stood back surveying it, they all felt that it\r\nwas worth all the trouble it had been to get it. The fireplace itself\r\nwas built up waist-high when the hearthstone was put in place.\r\n\r\nMarian was planning a good handy place to cook over, and several of\r\nthe scraps of iron were used with that idea. The old twisted, rusty\r\noarlock, for instance, was converted into a hook to hang the kettle\r\non at one side, and there were various little places made, to put\r\nthings on to keep hot or to go on slowly cooking. At the proper height\r\na mantel-shelf was put in, too, a smooth piece of driftwood. It had\r\nonce been a board about a foot wide by three or three and a half long,\r\nbut it had been tossed and beaten till the edges were thin and ragged.\r\nMarian fitted it across and surveyed it with pride.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if the longest and most tiresome part of the work was the\r\nbuilding of the chimney. Massive was the word for it. It was continued\r\nup pretty high. Marian climbed up on the roof-timbers and had the\r\nchildren hand her the stones and mortar.\r\n\r\nThey got well tired of the job before it was finished. At the last,\r\nMarian herself would help gather a pile of stones, and then, after\r\nmixing the mortar, would climb up on the roof and work away, and\r\nDelbert would hand up the rocks one by one and the mortar in the little\r\nwooden pail. She used the dig-spoon and the little spade for trowels,\r\nassisted by a piece of old board she had whittled into shape.\r\n\r\nYet, after all, considering how tiresome it must have been, the\r\nchildren were pretty good about it. Delbert never complained of the\r\nmonotony, and though the little girls were quite sure Marian was\r\nbuilding that chimney higher and thicker than was at all necessary,\r\nthey did their work cheerfully.\r\n\r\nThey stopped when their good lime gave out, but Marian was sure that\r\nshe had it high enough to draw well at all times, and so big and\r\nsolid that it would not blow over in a storm, even if it had not been\r\nprotected to some extent by the high rock, or cliff, back of it.\r\n\r\nShe would have been glad of more lime, but it was such a task to gather\r\nand burn the shells that she decided to finish the house without it.\r\nThey gathered up their _pitalla_ poles now, clean, creamy-white poles,\r\nwhich they fastened in place by tightly lashing with small ropes. Where\r\nthey needed them in the walls they packed the end that rested on the\r\nground with rocks and mud and tied the upper ends. The house began to\r\ntake shape rapidly. The _pitalla_ poles were easily split when smaller,\r\nfiner pieces were needed.\r\n\r\nFinally they were ready for the thatch. It would take a great many\r\ntrips to get that. They knew of but one place where it grew, and that\r\nwas away up by the lagoon. They would go and cut grass, or rather dig\r\nit out by the roots, till they had enough for a bundle for each one.\r\nThese bundles were graduated in size, of course, but Marian allowed\r\nno shirking. Nobody really tried to shirk but Davie. He didn’t like\r\nto carry thatch-grass down to the _estero_, and he tried all kinds of\r\nexcuses to get out of it, but Marian was firm.\r\n\r\n“Every little helps,” she said. “It is work that you can do, and you\r\nmust.”\r\n\r\nSo, in spite of his grumblings and groanings, Davie carried his little\r\nbundle as well as the rest. They would make several trips, stacking\r\nthe grass in a pile at the pier; then they would stop and carry it all\r\nto the top of the hill to the new house, and Marian and Delbert would\r\nput it on the roof. Jackie helped them there. He did not mind carrying\r\nquite a bundle of grass up the hill, for it was light and did not tax\r\nhis strength. It was pulling that Jackie objected to.\r\n\r\nThey put the grass on very thick, tying each little bunch very firm and\r\ntight to the split _pitalla_ prepared for it. Here again the little\r\ngirls felt very sure that Marian was doing a much better job than was\r\nat all necessary. They were quite sure that much less grass would do\r\njust as well. But Marian, remembering the fury of that first storm on\r\nthe Island, was not going to run any risks, and Delbert backed her\r\nup in her determination. So for weeks they worked at it, digging and\r\ntugging at the grass up by the lagoon, often cutting their fingers on\r\nthe sharp edges, toiling down through the hot sun to the _estero_ with\r\ntheir bundles, tying them on the Muggywah, and then paddling back home.\r\nThen, when Marian and Delbert climbed up on the roof, the little girls\r\nhanded up bunch after bunch of the rank, heavy grass to the two above,\r\nwho tied them with the stout little cords that they sometimes took a\r\nday off to make. And finally the whole roof was covered with a thick\r\nmat of the rustling grass, the long loose ends of each row hanging well\r\ndown over the root ends of the row below. Several poles were fastened\r\nacross to hold it down better and make it all the surer that the wind\r\nwould not get in underneath and undo any of their labor.\r\n\r\nThen there were the sides to come next. Marian had thought that they\r\nwould maybe thatch them too, but the children were tired of going after\r\ngrass. Indeed, they had gathered all the best of it; what was left was\r\nso much shorter and thinner that it would take much more time to get\r\nit. So she cast about for other material nearer home.\r\n\r\nThere were several big rocks in a line with the walls, two of which\r\nwere immovable, but there were several others that they succeeded\r\nin prying up and swinging round into place. In between them Marian\r\nbuilt up a wall even with their tops, using for her mortar the shells\r\nthat had not been well burned, mixing them with clay brought from the\r\npasture. It was very tiresome bringing it, but it did nicely after they\r\ngot it there, for it dried hard and smooth and would stay so as long as\r\nit was kept dry at least.\r\n\r\nOne thing Marian was particular about was to use only the fresh water\r\nfor her mortar. It was more trouble than it would have been to use\r\nsalt, but she had heard some of the men at the Port once talking about\r\nsome one who had made a failure of a kiln of bricks because he had\r\nused salt water in the making. She did not remember what they had said\r\nwas the reason why the salt was bad in that particular place, nor just\r\nwhat effect it had had, but she intended to run no risks; so her mortar\r\nwas all mixed with water from the well on the pier side of the Island.\r\n\r\nBut she could not build up the entire wall that way, and by the time\r\nshe had it up as high as the big rocks there were no more loose stones\r\nnear them and she had used up every bit of her burnt shells. All hands\r\nwere very tired, too, of lugging earth from the pasture, and they could\r\nfind no clay nearer home.\r\n\r\nShe turned to the banana-patch then, and they tore the big stalks\r\ninto strips of uniform size and used these to weave in basket-fashion\r\nbetween the uprights and the split _pitallas_. It did very well except\r\nthat, as with everything else, Marian insisted upon its being done so\r\nwell that it seemed to take forever to do it. They also used the dried\r\nleaves, weaving them in and out and pounding them down so as to have a\r\ngood thick wall. Some kinds of brush they used, too, fine branches that\r\nhad no thorns, or at least no large ones, but the fibrous strips of\r\nthe banana stalks were the main material used.\r\n\r\nThis part of the task was something they could all work at. Even Davie\r\nlearned quickly how to weave in brush and banana stalk and work and\r\npound them down. Up under the eaves they were not quite so particular\r\nto have it thick and firm.\r\n\r\nFinally it was all done. There remained now but the floor, the doors,\r\nand the windows.\r\n\r\nThe floor must be leveled and made as smooth as possible. It was so\r\nrocky and rough that it seemed the only way would be to build up from\r\nthe lower side with stones. There were plenty of stones, but they had\r\nto be brought from some little distance now, as everything loose in the\r\nneighborhood had been pretty well cleaned up. Marian packed stones in\r\nas well as she could, and when it was comparatively level, filled in\r\nthe chinks with pebbles and wads of banana leaves, and then they lugged\r\nup pailful after pailful of sand from the beach.\r\n\r\nJackie helped here too. They made a pair of sacks by folding a blanket\r\nover once and sewing up the ends. This could be thrown over Jackie’s\r\nback. They put in as much sand as they thought he would stand, and\r\nthen, when the rest of them had their loads ready, they would all go\r\nup the hill together. Some one had to watch pretty closely to see that\r\nthe load did not slip off over Jackie’s tail on the steep parts of\r\nthe path, but he carried so much more than any of them cared to that\r\nit paid to use him. Of course, if they had really put much of a load\r\non him, he would probably have balked as was his habit, but they were\r\ncareful not to do that. Marian thought that he would gradually get used\r\nto carrying loads and be a great help to them some time in the future.\r\n\r\nThey poured the sand on the floor, where it ran down into the cracks\r\nand little holes, till after two or three days of pretty steady work\r\nthe cracks seemed to be all filled up and their floor was level and\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nThen they went to Bonanza Cove, where in the storms the seaweed had\r\nbeen pounded and churned and tossed far up on the beach; there it had\r\ndried and bleached in the suns of later days till now it could be\r\npeeled up in great white layers. They took this dried seaweed in as big\r\nflakes as they could carry without breaking it, and carpeted every\r\nbit of the floor, clear up to the hearthstone. But Marian was a little\r\nafraid this was too near the fire for safety; so they hunted till they\r\nfound enough big flat stones to lay a row all around the hearth. Then,\r\nby wetting the seaweed, they could pack this row down to a level with\r\nthe hearthstone, and finally, after filling with sand all the little\r\ncorners where the stones did not just match, they felt pretty certain\r\nthat no sparks would fly out far enough to set their carpet on fire.\r\n\r\nThen they moved in. It was not so tremendous a task. There was no\r\npacking or unpacking to do, no bickering with drivers of moving-vans.\r\nThey simply gathered up their bedding and bags of feathers and dumped\r\nthem down in one corner on the floor, and then brought over the few\r\nutensils from the Cave. A very few more trips brought over all the odds\r\nand ends that had accumulated,--pretty shells and other small treasures\r\nsuch as children always collect.\r\n\r\nThe new home was very irregular in shape, for their material had been\r\nfar from regular or uniform and they had had to place their posts and\r\npoles where the unyielding rocks would receive them best, but the room\r\naveraged about eight feet by fifteen, the eaves being about six feet\r\nlower than the side built against the cliff.\r\n\r\nThere were two narrow doors and one window, and for the doors Marian\r\nmade a light frame of split _pitalla_ tied together at the corners\r\nand then wove a sort of mat of palm-leaf across them. This was too\r\nlight and thin to be trusted in a storm; so of stouter material, split\r\n_pitalla_, but heavier pieces, she made a pair of large, heavy frames\r\nand covered these with thatch-grass, for which they made another trip\r\nto the lagoon. Even then it was not quite enough, and she finished with\r\npalm-leaves, the old dried ones that were not strong enough for ropes,\r\nbut could be used whole. Some of these, too, she tied on the outside\r\nof the house where the wattling seemed to be a little thin; they would\r\nhelp a little when the rains came.\r\n\r\nThe light doors she fastened on permanently with fiber ropes, but the\r\nheavy storm doors were left outside, where they were out of the way\r\nordinarily, but could be quickly put into place and tied over the\r\nothers when a storm came up. She did not bother to make a mat frame\r\nfor the window, but contented herself with the one heavy thatch one,\r\nwhich was fastened across the top so that it could be swung out and up\r\nand be propped with a stick, thus making a shade over the opening like\r\nan awning; it could also be swung down and tied tight whenever desired.\r\n\r\nInside there were several shelves put up by swinging them from the\r\nroof, and their largest piece of driftwood, laid across two rocks, made\r\na very good table. These and the mantel-shelf were enough to hold all\r\ntheir dishes and other valuables. The bedding, folded up neatly in a\r\ncorner, did not take up much room. The fireplace did not smoke, and it\r\nwas very convenient indeed for the cooking.\r\n\r\nAt night the children lay down where they chose on the clean, springy\r\nseaweed floor, and pulled a part of a blanket or a rabbit-skin robe or\r\nthe big cape over them and slept the sleep of the healthy till morning.\r\n\r\nThey had no lamp or lantern, but the bark of the _pitalla_ burned with\r\na white light that made the inside of the little house very cheery and\r\ncozy of an evening, and was a good enough light for anything they might\r\nwant to do.\r\n\r\nThey had begun the house at the end of one rainy season; they had\r\nit finished just as the next one was upon them. They went with the\r\nMuggywah and gathered up all the _pitalla_ bark, now nicely dry, which\r\nhad been stripped from their poles and which they had not already\r\nbrought in, and stored it in the Cave to keep it dry, and when they had\r\nthat full they piled another heap in another cave, where it would be\r\npartially protected from the wet.\r\n\r\nThey gathered, too, a big pile of driftwood near the house,--light\r\nstuff such as the waves were always tossing up, and as much heavy stuff\r\nas they could get for back-logs to bury at night, so as to have good\r\nembers in the mornings when it was cold, for a bed of hot embers was a\r\ncomfort indeed to start in with.\r\n\r\nThe children had begun calling the new home a wigwam, but Marian said\r\nshe was quite sure that a wigwam was always made of skins stretched\r\nover poles, but she believed--she was not quite _sure_, but she\r\nbelieved--that a wickiup was made of wattles with a thatch or dirt\r\nroof; so, of course, theirs was a wickiup.\r\n\r\nRainy days had no terrors for them now, and no dreariness. They would\r\ndo what was needful to make the little burros comfortable, gather into\r\nthe wickiup what food and fuel was needed for the next day and night,\r\nclose the storm door, on the side the wind and rain were coming from\r\nand open the other to let in plenty of light.\r\n\r\nA very small fire would keep the room comfortable, and they could sit\r\nwarm and dry, and do whatever amused them best,--weave baskets, or\r\nmake little ropes, or sharpen knives or the hatchet. Rainy days were\r\ngood times to crochet fiber into bags or clothing and to bore holes in\r\nwampum. Delbert made himself a beautiful wampum belt. It was woven of\r\nfiber about two inches wide, and he covered it with little shells sewed\r\non through two little holes bored in each one. It was a great deal of\r\nwork, but he was very much interested in it, and showed such ability in\r\nboring holes without breaking the shells, and in sewing them on so that\r\nthey made a pretty pattern, that Marian was as proud of him for doing\r\nit as he was proud of the belt when it was done.\r\n\r\nIt was that summer that Marian took up the long-neglected task of\r\nthe children’s education. She was handicapped certainly; her sole\r\nschoolroom equipments were half a lead-pencil, a piece of blue chalk\r\nhalf as big as her thumb, which chanced to be in her workbag, and a\r\npart of a newspaper that had lain in the bottom of their lunch-basket\r\nand had a dozen times only narrowly escaped being used up for something\r\nelse. This paper consisted mainly of advertisements of real estate for\r\nsale, male and female help wanted, and a page of sporting news and\r\nmarket reports, with half a column of mineral discoveries. It was not\r\nan ideal primer, but it would do to teach Davie his letters from.\r\n\r\nThere was a place on the rock wall that was comparatively smooth, and\r\nMarian made it more so by rubbing it with flat stones small enough to\r\nbe handled easily and as much like a grindstone in composition as she\r\ncould find. She would rub and rub, throw on a little water, and rub\r\nagain, and she kept that up till she had a space that would serve very\r\nwell as a blackboard. Of course the blue chalk did not last long, but\r\nthen they used bits of charcoal, and if bones were burnt just right\r\nthey made a very good substitute for chalk. A bunch of mescal or\r\nbanana fiber made a very good eraser.\r\n\r\nThere were several pieces of driftwood smooth enough to do for slates,\r\nand one or two bits of flat stones also. Clamshells were useful. They\r\nhad quite a number of these, as big as saucers, that they had used as\r\ndishes. Marian took them now and made school readers of them. With\r\nthe lead-pencil she wrote lessons on them, Mother Goose verses, bits\r\nof poetry that did not have too many big words in them, remembered\r\nproverbs, and little stories. When the three older children could read\r\nand spell all the words in them, she washed them out and wrote another\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nArithmetic was taught by means of the blackboard and little shells,\r\nstones, and seeds. Delbert always did his figuring on the hearthstone.\r\nHe would stretch out on his stomach and elbows, his chin in his hands,\r\nand his feet kicking at all angles.\r\n\r\nThe other children had to give him a wide berth or they got all kinds\r\nof cracks. Jennie complained that she could not think lying down,\r\nso she always used the blackboard. Esther used it too, not because\r\nher brain would not work horizontally, but because when Delbert had\r\nthe hearth there was no room for any one else there, and he made his\r\nfigures as big as all out-of-doors anyway. After all, mental arithmetic\r\nwas more satisfactory, and Marian drilled them pretty well in that.\r\n\r\nThe paper-tree proved a treasure to them. It is, I think, in some\r\nrespects a distant cousin of the birch. At any rate, its bark can be\r\npeeled off in the same way, only it is much thinner--of paperlike\r\nthickness, or thinness rather--and partially transparent. When she\r\ncould get good pieces of this, Marian never failed to acquire them, and\r\nshe made books of it, clumsy, of course, but serving a little better\r\nthan the clamshells.\r\n\r\nShe was constantly experimenting for ink, testing every juice she came\r\nacross that seemed at all likely. Pens she could make, as her ancestors\r\nhad before her, of big quills. Her little penknife had never been much\r\nused except to whittle out toys for Christmas, and it was just the\r\nthing to make quill pens with.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Delbert and the girls were eager to learn. They did not\r\nwant to be behind their mates when they got back to them, and as they\r\nwere all three pretty bright, Marian’s task was much easier than it\r\nwould otherwise have been.\r\n\r\nBut Davie was not over anxious to spend time on what seemed to him so\r\nuseless. He was more backward than either of the others, too, and with\r\nhim Marian had need of the most loving patience, also of ingenuity in\r\nthinking up ways to get him interested. Fortunately, she was patient,\r\nand, moreover, loved the little fellow so fervently that she would have\r\ndeveloped patience even had she been naturally devoid of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDAVIE’S PANAL HUNT: AND WHAT CAME OF IT\r\n\r\n\r\nDavie was really getting to be quite a chunk of a boy. He was different\r\nfrom Delbert,--more square and solid of build, of quieter and calmer\r\ntemperament too, slower in his motions and also in his thought and\r\nspeech. In features he resembled Esther more than any of the others.\r\n\r\nHe was a very straightforward little fellow. No matter how much he\r\ndiffered from the others, he never saw any reason for concealing his\r\nopinions or denying his actions. He did not talk much, but seemed to\r\ndo his share of thinking, and when he reached a conclusion was apt\r\nto cling to it rather tenaciously. He usually yielded to Marian’s\r\nauthority with a pretty good grace, but as he grew older he was more\r\nand more apt to disregard the wishes of the others when they crossed\r\nhis own. Jennie could, as a rule, manage him pretty well, for she was\r\nvery diplomatic about it, and seemed to have a gift for knowing when to\r\ncoax and pet him into doing what she wanted him to and when to twist\r\nhim adroitly round her fingers in some other way.\r\n\r\nEsther, too, though she was not so successful as Jennie, rarely clashed\r\nwith her little brother, but Delbert, having perhaps less of the guile\r\nof the serpent in his make-up, often did clash in a small way. He\r\nthought that as he was older his wishes should have the preference as\r\na matter of course. But Davie held other ideas. He did not propose\r\nto have Delbert bossing him just because he was bigger, and often he\r\nwas stubborn just for the pleasure of plaguing his older brother. The\r\ntrouble was never very deep-seated. Two minutes after an explosion\r\nof hot words on Delbert’s part had called Marian’s attention so that\r\nshe could settle the matter, whatever it was, the little boy would be\r\ncuddled up beside the older one, sweet-tempered and smiling as you\r\nplease.\r\n\r\nDelbert never seemed to lay Davie’s naughtiness up against him after\r\nthe immediate occasion had passed. But one day there were after effects\r\nwhich neither of them had counted upon.\r\n\r\nDavie had gone with Delbert and Esther up into the pasture to see how a\r\ncertain _panal_ was growing, Marian and Jennie being detained at the\r\nwickiup. The _panal_ was still too small to be molested, so they went\r\nback, skirting the high, rocky part of the Island that lay overlooking\r\nthe shallow part of the harbor. They went down to the water once and\r\nthen climbed up again, and Delbert suggested that they go back to the\r\nlevel pasture and follow the path home as the quickest way of getting\r\nthere. Davie, for no reason save that Delbert wanted to go back to the\r\npath, decided that he wanted to continue climbing over the rocks; he\r\nsaid he was looking for _panales_.\r\n\r\nDelbert did not want to go on and leave him behind, for they were a\r\nlong way from the wickiup, and Davie was little. But he coaxed to no\r\navail and issued positive orders with as little result. Esther, too,\r\ntried her hand, but it was useless. Davie continued wending his way\r\nalong the roughest, rockiest part, “looking for _panales_.”\r\n\r\nDelbert fretted and fumed, and presently they came to where Davie must\r\ncome back to the level land or else crawl along where it was really\r\ndangerous for him to go.\r\n\r\nHad it been Jennie, she would have looked the other way, started a\r\nconversation with Esther about something a long way off, and pretended\r\nto forget all about the little boy, and he, finding himself no longer\r\nin the lime-light, as it were, would have quietly come back and trailed\r\nalong in the path behind her. But Delbert was pretty well worked up\r\nanyway, and he was truly alarmed for Davie’s safety in that spot.\r\n\r\n“Now, Davie, you will have to come back,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No, go along here,” returned Davie with true Indian brevity.\r\n\r\n“Why, you can’t! Honest, Davie, it isn’t safe. Marian wouldn’t let you\r\nif she were here. Come on, now.”\r\n\r\nDavie hesitated a minute, debating whether he should attempt farther\r\nadvance where he was or go back with the others. To jump across to the\r\nnext rock was almost beyond his daring, but it would be having his own\r\nway. He made, or appeared to make, preparation for it.\r\n\r\nA quick, hot wave of anger flashed over Delbert. He started forward,\r\nintending to catch his naughty little brother and carry him back along\r\nthe path by force, at least till they were well past the rocky danger.\r\nHe knew he could do it, once he got hold of him.\r\n\r\nDavie knew it, too, and made all haste to jump before Delbert could\r\nget to him. Perhaps he could have made it, if he had done it with\r\ndeliberation, but, as it was, he slipped, missed his mark, lost his\r\nbalance, and, slipping, failed to regain it and fell.\r\n\r\nDelbert and Esther never will forget the sickening horror of that\r\nmoment. They rushed forward and scrambled down the rocks as best they\r\ncould to where the little boy lay, making no effort to get up, but\r\nscreaming at the top of his lungs.\r\n\r\nEsther was crying, too, but Delbert managed to control himself enough\r\nto refrain from that, and, frightened as he was, horrified through and\r\nthrough, he could still reflect that though such a fall might easily\r\nhave broken his neck, Davie’s yells proved he was still very much alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DAVIE’S FALL]\r\n\r\nWhen he reached his little brother and tried to pick him up he screamed\r\nlouder than before, if possible, and then Delbert saw that one leg\r\nwas bent in a way that proved even to his inexperience that the bone\r\nwas broken. There was also a cut on the head that was bleeding badly.\r\nWith white face and shaking fingers Delbert examined the head and was\r\nrelieved to find that the skull did not seem to be broken, so he took\r\noff the rag that was tied about his own head to keep the hair out of\r\nhis eyes, and tied it about Davie’s to stop the bleeding. There was\r\nonly salt water to be had just there, and Delbert did not know enough\r\nto know whether that would do at all to put on or not, but he knew it\r\nwould make the wounds smart badly, so he did not risk washing them with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nEsther had already started off to carry the news to Marian. Delbert\r\nalmost wished he had gone himself, as he would probably have reached\r\nthe wickiup a few minutes sooner. Still, supposing Davie were hurt\r\ninside! Supposing he were to die before Marian got there!\r\n\r\nIf Delbert had been older and wiser, he would have known that only\r\nabout half of Davie’s yells were from the pain of his injuries, and\r\nthe other half were from fright at the pain. As it was, not daring to\r\nmove the little fellow a bit lest he hurt him more, he could only curl\r\ndown beside him and, putting his arms around him, kiss him and talk as\r\nsoothingly as he could.\r\n\r\nOne arm that lay under him Davie did not try to move, but he put the\r\nother about Delbert’s neck and sobbed, “I--want--to go--back--to--to\r\nthe--path, Dellie!”\r\n\r\nA week later Delbert sat down and laughed till his sides ached over the\r\nmemory of that speech, but at the time it did not strike him as being\r\nat all funny.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she got back to the smooth ground, Esther ran like a little\r\ndeer, ran and ran, stumbled and fell twice, and picked herself up and\r\nran again till she was out of breath, and walked till she regained it,\r\nand ran again. She was all out of breath when she stumbled into the\r\nwickiup.\r\n\r\nMarian was not there. She and Jennie had started down the new path for\r\nwater, but in answer to Esther’s wild calls they quickly returned. The\r\ntears had made streaks through the dirt that Esther got on her face\r\nwhen she fell, and she was sobbing so she could not talk straight.\r\n\r\n“Oh, he wouldn’t mind Dellie, Marian, he wouldn’t mind Dellie, and he\r\nfell way down on the rocks, and he’s all broken and bleedy!”\r\n\r\nIt was not a very reassuring way to tell news certainly. Jennie began\r\nto cry, but though Marian’s face went white, she remained calm.\r\n\r\n“Esther, who fell?”\r\n\r\n“Davie. He wouldn’t mind Dellie--”\r\n\r\n“There, there! Listen, Esther! Esther, is he dead?”\r\n\r\n“N--n--not yet,” gasped Esther, “but he’s all bleedy and Dellie says\r\nhis leg is broke, and he is crying awfully.”\r\n\r\nMarian drew a long breath; then, “Jennie, stop crying, so you can help\r\nme,” she said. “Esther, sit down there and get your breath. Where is\r\nDavie? Where did he fall?”\r\n\r\n“Down by Little Pig Cove. He wouldn’t go in the path, and he tried to\r\njump and he fell, and Dellie stayed with him.”\r\n\r\nMarian pressed her hands tightly to her temples for a moment, and in\r\nthat moment thought of all that she could do.\r\n\r\n“Esther,” she said, “fold that blanket to take back with us. Did\r\nDelbert have his good lariat with him? Yes? Then see if you can find\r\nanother stick like this out in the pile. Jennie, hold this jar so I can\r\npour what water is in the demijohn into it. There, it isn’t full, but\r\nwe can’t stop to go for more now.”\r\n\r\nEsther appeared with the two sticks. Marian made a bundle of their old\r\nragged clothes and gave it to Jennie to carry; then, taking the jar of\r\nwater and the blanket, she followed Esther’s lead as fast as she could.\r\n\r\nWhen they got back to where the boys were, they found Davie still lying\r\nwhere he fell, sobbing, but not quite so wildly as at first.\r\n\r\nDelbert, white-faced and shaken still, crouched beside him.\r\n\r\nMarian examined the child as well as she could. The cut on the head\r\nwas already ceasing to bleed, and the other scratches and bumps, ugly\r\nthough they were, did not alarm her, but at sight of that little\r\ncrooked leg her heart sank. How could she set a bone? She mistrusted\r\nthat the under arm was injured too, and goodness only knew how much\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nShe set Jennie and Delbert to making a stretcher out of the two sticks\r\nand the blanket, while she and Esther hunted up some sticks as nearly\r\nstraight as they could find to make a temporary splint for the leg,\r\ntill they could get back to the wickiup.\r\n\r\nEvery time they moved the leg, Davie screamed and beat at them with\r\nhis good arm. He made no attempt to move the other one. At last Marian\r\nordered Jennie and Esther to hold him and his pugnacious little arm,\r\nwhile she and Delbert managed the leg.\r\n\r\nJennie began to cry. “O Marian, don’t! don’t!” she sobbed.\r\n\r\nMarian sat up and pushed back some loose strands of hair that straggled\r\nover her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Jennie,” she said, “we have _got_ to hurt him. We can’t help it. We\r\nhave _got_ to get him back to the wickiup, where I can fix it--as well\r\nas I can. If we don’t get it right, he will be a cripple all his life.\r\nThe pain won’t kill him; just the pain won’t, dearie. He may faint, but\r\nit won’t be any worse. Don’t make it worse by your crying.”\r\n\r\nSo Jennie controlled herself as well as she could, and she and Esther,\r\nsteeling their hearts, held the little arm and head and shoulder down,\r\nwhile Marian straightened the leg a little and arranged it so it would\r\nbe held fairly steady as they carried him back. Then she turned him\r\nover and examined the arm. She could not see that it was hurt, but\r\nshe knew it must be. As gently as she could, she lifted him on to the\r\nstretcher and gave him a big drink of water. Then they started back.\r\nDavie and Esther cried all the way.\r\n\r\nAt the wickiup they laid him as gently as they could on the floor, but\r\nhe screamed with the pain nevertheless. Marian set all three of the\r\nothers to bringing up water, and she put some on in the little kettle\r\nover the fire.\r\n\r\nShe washed off the blood and dirt and tore her bathing-suit into\r\nbandages. Fortunately, it was clean, having been washed and boiled in\r\nfresh water, as it chanced, since she had used it, and she put a clean\r\nbandage around the head in the place of the rather dirty rag that\r\nDelbert had tied it with. Then she gathered all the little pieces of\r\nboard they had, and while the others brought the water, she worked at\r\nsplints.\r\n\r\nWhen she had got these ready, she straightened her patient out on the\r\nfloor on his back, and undid the first hasty bandaging and tried to\r\nstraighten his leg till it would look and feel just like the other one.\r\nJennie and Esther were too much wrought up by Davie’s suffering to be\r\nof much service, but Delbert set his white lips together and held the\r\nscreaming child firmly. At last they thought it seemed to be right and\r\nbandaged it up.\r\n\r\n“Marian,” said Delbert, “his shoulder cracked awful funny just now.”\r\n\r\nAfter a little examination she said, “I guess it must have been twisted\r\nout of place a little and slipped back in. You see, he moves it now,\r\nand it certainly feels just like the other one, at any rate.”\r\n\r\nShe felt him all over, but could find nothing more that seemed like\r\nbroken bones, for which she was devoutly thankful.\r\n\r\nShe had an idea that Davie must not be moved at all for a week at\r\nleast, and as a precaution against this she tied the bandaged leg to\r\nthe side of the wickiup. For the life of her she could not remember\r\nhow long it took a broken bone to heal, though she must some time have\r\nheard some one say; and of course the others were no wiser. Delbert had\r\nit running in his head that it was three weeks, but Jennie said, “No,\r\nthat is how long it takes a chicken to hatch.”\r\n\r\n“Anyway,” said Esther, “when it does grow together it itches awfully. I\r\nheard Mr. Faston say so.”\r\n\r\nDavie was so exhausted that he slept quite a while that afternoon, but\r\nby night he was awake and feverish, and, of course, very fretful.\r\n\r\nMarian kept pouring a little cold water on his bandages. She was sure\r\nthat was the right thing to do, and she sat beside him, soothing him by\r\nevery device she could think of and feeling her heart grow heavier and\r\nheavier as his fever rose and he struggled to turn and toss, and moaned\r\nand cried.\r\n\r\nAt night the little girls slept, and Delbert too to some extent, but\r\nthere was no sleep for Marian. She was afraid there was some internal\r\ninjury, not knowing that the fever was the natural result of the shock\r\nand hurt and only what any doctor would have expected.\r\n\r\nShe kept the bandages wet with cold water and wrung out hot cloths and\r\napplied them to the sore and lame spots. She bathed and rubbed and\r\nworked over Davie and she kept her voice cheerful and her eyes smiling,\r\nthough a sickening fear held her heart.\r\n\r\nIt was days and days before she could feel at all easy, but the fever\r\ndeparted, the swellings went down, and no more lame spots came to\r\nlight. Davie ate well and slept fairly well too. He began to regain his\r\nold sunny ways, and the tension on Marian’s nerves relaxed. But, of\r\ncourse, she had to stay by him pretty closely; so the other children\r\nperformed the business of the day alone.\r\n\r\nThey attended to the garden and went down after each tide to see if\r\nthere were any fish in High-Tide Pool, because, though they never\r\nfound a whole school in there as they had on that day soon after their\r\narrival, still there were very likely to be one or two lurking in the\r\ndark hole in the rocks, and one child would wade in and scare them out,\r\nand Delbert, standing ready with the spear, would gather them in. There\r\nwere quite a number of places among the rocks where fish, and often\r\nbig fish, were to be found after high tide. If they could get them\r\nthat way, it saved going at night, and of course they could not well\r\ndo that now. Anyway, it took quite a pile of _pitalla_ to light them\r\nfor a night’s spearing, and _pitalla_ was getting scarce in the near\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDELBERT’S BIG GAME\r\n\r\n\r\nDelbert was getting tired of small game now. He began to plan for deer\r\nand pork. He made himself a new bow, larger and stronger than he had\r\never had before, with a new, strong string, and he made new arrows\r\ntipped with the best points he could get, and then he and Esther went\r\ndeer-hunting.\r\n\r\nJennie always stayed with Marian, to help with Davie and because she\r\nreally did not like hunting. She could not bear to kill things nor to\r\nsee them killed. She carried her bow and arrows and shot at marks along\r\nwith the rest of them, and sometimes at game, but she never seemed to\r\nenjoy it when she hit it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was light enough for them to see their way at all,\r\nDelbert and Esther would creep out and try for a close approach to\r\nthe deer. Sometimes they did not come back till about noon, their\r\nonly breakfast having been some raw vegetables carried with them, a\r\nfew bananas usually, which they carried in their quivers with their\r\narrows,--sometimes not even that. Marian had no hopes of their ever\r\ngetting a deer, but she never discouraged them. She and Jennie could\r\nmanage Davie and tend the little burros, and the lessons could be\r\nstudied in the afternoons. Davie, poor boy, certainly had to take his\r\nlessons with great regularity in those days; there was no way he could\r\nescape from them. Marian had had to loosen his bandages a number of\r\ntimes, but she did not yet dare take them off, though she had not kept\r\nhim strapped to the house very long.\r\n\r\nMarian now began to study very earnestly on the spinning and weaving\r\nproblem. Rabbit-skin clothing was very unsatisfactory, as were the\r\ncrocheted fiber things, too, though for different reasons, but little\r\nKing David’s misfortune had simply wiped every other kind out of\r\nexistence. What with bandages and towels, there was not one single\r\nthin, worn garment left, only a little pile of frayed rags. Marian took\r\nher swim at night now. It was imperative that new clothes be acquired\r\nin some way, and she thought and thought, and was just beginning to\r\nsee light on the subject when Esther came tearing in one morning,\r\nbreathless and disheveled, to announce that Delbert had killed his deer.\r\n\r\nHis sisters could scarcely credit the story, but Marian took the path\r\nstraightway, leaving Jennie to keep Davie company and give him his\r\nfrequently demanded drinks of water and dampen his bandages and see if\r\nhe had remembered from yesterday the little words written on the big\r\nclamshell. Marian found Delbert dancing a veritable war dance round a\r\nfair-sized buck. The thing had happened almost as far back as Little\r\nPig Cove, where Davie had fallen, and, in a way, the two occurrences\r\nwere somewhat similar.\r\n\r\nDelbert and Esther had crept along that morning, as luck would have it,\r\nin time to witness a very serious disagreement between two bucks. The\r\nwind was in their favor; otherwise they might not have got quite so\r\nclose to where the two were struggling together.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of them had thought they should cross the pasture on the\r\nlevel land, perhaps the other wanted the herd to hunt _panales_ among\r\nthe rocks. Delbert never knew what the quarrel was about. He had read\r\nof such things, but this was his first chance to see anything of the\r\nsort. His blood leaped, and his eyes sparkled. Esther, a little behind\r\nhim, practically inclined, fitted an arrow to her bow and shot. In her\r\nexcitement the shaft went wide of the mark; so much so that no one, not\r\neven the deer, noticed it at all, a result which so sobered her that\r\nshe did not try again. Delbert was actually forgetting to shoot at all,\r\nwhich Esther afterwards declared was worse than shooting and missing,\r\neven as wildly as she had.\r\n\r\nBut the stronger of the two bucks was beginning to push the other\r\nabout, and in the scuffle they worked nearer and nearer to the edge of\r\nthe rocks, though it is hardly likely this was other than accidental.\r\nProbably they were so taken up with their tussle that they did not\r\nnotice where they were going. But presently a rock loosened and\r\nslipped, and then, before they could realize what was happening, a\r\ngreat mass of rocks and earth and bushes fell thundering down the steep\r\nto the level strip below.\r\n\r\nEsther screamed and ran back; the group of deer which had been watching\r\nthe combat also fled, and did not stop till they had reached the\r\nsafety of the farther pasture. One of the fighting bucks was able to\r\nspring back and save himself, and he fled with the rest, but the other\r\none went down with the avalanche.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HE COULD SEE THE BUCK STRUGGLING TO FREE HIMSELF]\r\n\r\nDelbert, with a shout, ran forward and began clambering down where it\r\nwas not so steep and appeared to be perfectly safe. In a minute he\r\ncould see the buck struggling to free himself from the mass of débris.\r\nEven then he did not think of the trusty bow and arrows he had taken\r\nsuch pains with for this very occasion, but, pulling out his long\r\nknife, he ran forward, and, by the time Esther had scrambled down\r\nbeside him, the deer had ceased to kick, and Delbert was tugging at the\r\nrocks that still partly covered it. He sent her post-haste for Marian,\r\nand when they got back to him, he had the deer pulled out on a clear\r\nspace and was already beginning to skin it.\r\n\r\nNeither of them knew a thing about cutting up such an animal except\r\nwhat they dimly remembered used to be done at “Grandpa’s” at\r\nhog-butchering time, but they managed to get the skin off after a\r\nfashion and they chopped and cut away at the rest, breaking the bones\r\nwith a stone or the hatchets when they could not find a joint.\r\n\r\nThe discarded parts they would leave there, for it was too far to carry\r\nthem to the watermelon-patch for fertilizer, and there were plenty of\r\nthe scavengers of the sea waiting for them to go so that they could\r\nclean up after them. The good meat they tied up in the skin, and they\r\nswung it on a pole and carried it home between them, Esther carrying\r\nthe hatchet and knives.\r\n\r\nIt was past noon when, blood-stained and weary, they arrived at the\r\nwickiup. Jennie was getting anxious, and Davie was decidedly fretful.\r\nDelbert was then sent out to the salt reef to bring back all the salt\r\nthere was there. They would need it besides what they already had\r\nin the wickiup, for Marian was determined not to lose a bit of that\r\nmeat. She cleaned up the pail and hung it over the fire too, for the\r\nkettle would not hold all the bones. Some of the ribs were put to\r\nroast immediately, and then she set to work cutting up and salting and\r\nhanging up to dry. They stretched a line out in the sun and hung the\r\npieces over that.\r\n\r\nThe skin would fill several long-felt wants, one of which was to\r\nprovide Marian with sandals. Her leather ones had worn entirely out,\r\nand she had tried fiber ones without much success; she had even tried\r\nwooden ones.\r\n\r\nBefore that meat was half gone,--and they ate with true Indian\r\nappetites,--Delbert had determined to go after pork. There was a\r\ncertain place on the farther end of the island where the pigs were\r\npretty apt to be found, especially in the heat of the day. It was back\r\nfrom the shore, but low. In fact, it was a lagoon of water in the\r\nrainy season and contained water till near the rains again. In one or\r\ntwo places the fresh water oozed out all the year round. It was here\r\nthat the young hunter proposed to make his attack.\r\n\r\nThe boy’s idea was certainly novel. Good as his new bow and arrows\r\nwere, he did not really suppose he could kill a hog with them except\r\nby accident. Perhaps a shot through the eye would be fatal,--he was\r\nnot sure,--but if one was merely wounded there was danger of the rest\r\nshowing fight, and--well, Delbert proposed to take no chances.\r\n\r\nSo where the big rocks, solid as the Island itself, overhung the bushes\r\nand little pools below, he would establish himself. Here he would\r\nbe where the game could not get at him without making a détour of a\r\nquarter of a mile or so, and, after he had cut some brush and piled it\r\nproperly, they could not see him either.\r\n\r\nSo with his hair rope he made a trap or snare across a much-used pig\r\npath, the rope running up over a crude but strong pulley and being tied\r\nabout a good-sized cactus in the rocks above. With the butcher knife\r\nlashed to the end of a good stout pole and several such implements by\r\nhis side he sat and waited patiently.\r\n\r\nWhen it became pretty warm, the pigs assembled by the lagoon to drink\r\nand wallow in the mud. Before so very long the Muggywah appeared,\r\nwith Jennie and Esther on board. They moored her out a little way and\r\nwaded in. Quietly they drove the herd up toward the rocks and bushes,\r\nfor, though not what could be called wild, the pigs would not permit a\r\nclose approach. Presently one of them poked his nose through Delbert’s\r\nwaiting noose, and Delbert fairly held his breath till he stepped on,\r\nand then he gave a mighty jerk and began hauling in his rope over the\r\npulley. He had caught the porker just back of one front leg, and the\r\nastonishment of that pig and his companions when he was thus lifted\r\nbodily into the air was enough, Delbert afterward said, to pay him for\r\nall his trouble.\r\n\r\nFrom behind his screen of rocks and bushes he pulled the squealing\r\nanimal up till he could reach him with a sort of shepherd’s crook he\r\nhad provided himself with; whereupon he fastened the rope and pulled\r\nthe pig in out of sight of its companions and dispatched it.\r\n\r\nAt the first squeal the girls had retreated most hastily to the\r\nMuggywah and pushed off, paddling back till they were well out of sight\r\nof the herd of pigs, when they moored the craft again, this time to a\r\nrock on shore, and, ascending the hill, circled round back till they\r\nfound Delbert cutting up the game.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DELBERT PULLED THE SQUEALING ANIMAL UP]\r\n\r\nThey did by it as they had done by the deer,--skinned it and carried\r\nthe meat home tied up in the skin slung over a pole. They had a stick\r\nwith a fork at one end, so each of the girls could take a fork, and\r\nDelbert managed the other end.\r\n\r\nAfter that Delbert had no more taste for potting small game. He spent\r\nhis time thinking up tricks and traps for deer and pigs. The deer were\r\nnot such easy marks, but the pigs, being more stupid or less shy, could\r\noften be successfully bagged by practically the same tactics as he had\r\nused the first time.\r\n\r\nFinally Marian suggested to him that it would be in the long run a\r\ngreat saving of time and an all-round better plan if he would build a\r\ngood little pen somewhere and catch rather small pigs and put them into\r\nit, where they could fatten them up on garden stuff, of which they had\r\nplenty now,--the inferior bananas, for instance,--and then they could\r\nkill them when they chose. Jennie thought of a good place for a pen,\r\nclose to the watermelon-patch, where there was a scrubby tree or two\r\nand a great overhanging rock that the pigs could go under for shade\r\nand shelter, and where they would not have to build a fence except on\r\ntwo sides.\r\n\r\nThe plan was put into operation and worked very well. They built the\r\nfence mostly of rocks piled up into a wall, and when it was finished,\r\nDelbert stocked it with youngsters that he was sure were quite old\r\nenough to leave their mothers. And the catching of them and the\r\nconveying of them across to the pen gave him much glee in spite of the\r\nhard labor involved.\r\n\r\nThe pork when killed was cured with salt and smoke. Marian did not\r\nhave very good success with the last method, yet she managed it after\r\na fashion. First she tried smoking the meat by hanging it over their\r\nchimney, but that was too hot, for it cooked it as well as smoking it\r\nand fried out all the grease too. But she did better when she built a\r\nsmokehouse where a tiny fire discharged its smoke through a tunnel in a\r\nbank that terminated in a little cubby-hole affair of sticks and rocks\r\nwhere the meat was laid. They called it a smokehouse. It was a sort of\r\ndoll smokehouse. The meat was always cut in rather small pieces and\r\nwell salted, for Marian had a horror of spoilt meat.\r\n\r\nSoap was also attempted,--staggered at, Marian said. She knew little\r\nabout it, but had seen Bobbie’s mother making it, and she happened to\r\nknow that ashes contained lye. The bottom of the wickerwork around the\r\ngood demijohn had worn clear through. Marian carefully broke it away\r\nat the neck as well and took it off entirely. Then, tipping it upside\r\ndown, she had a basket forsooth. She lined the sides with green banana\r\nleaves and filled it full of ashes.\r\n\r\nShe rigged it up where she could slip under it the old broken demijohn\r\nthey had found in the cove and had used so much, which would hold\r\nabout a gallon. Then she poured a little water on the ashes, and when\r\nthat soaked in, a little more, and kept it up till she had it dripping\r\nthrough into the old demijohn below. Thus she leached out her lye. And\r\nif it did not seem very strong, she could boil it down in the porcelain\r\nkettle, which was the only thing she had that she dared use for that\r\npurpose, though she could boil things and even try out her grease in\r\nMr. Cunningham’s pail.\r\n\r\nWhen the lye was stout enough to suit her, she put it into the\r\ntwo-quart glass jar or the bottles, and finally she started in with\r\nthe soap-making. Well, she made it, but don’t imagine it was nice\r\nwhite, sweet-smelling soap, such as you can buy, for it certainly was\r\nnot. She made, first and last, a good many batches. Some of it would\r\nharden, and some would not.\r\n\r\nWhat did harden she cut into cakes and put on a shelf to dry, where it\r\nwould proceed to do so, shrinking itself up into the most absurd shapes\r\nof about half its former size. And what would not harden, she put into\r\nbroken bottles or great shells or hollowed-out pieces of wood, but it\r\nwas nearly all black in color and smelled--oh, like nothing in the\r\nworld but very strong-smelling soap, but it would make a lather, after\r\na fashion, and would take out dirt and grease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWHEREWITHAL SHALL WE BE CLOTHED?\r\n\r\n\r\nMarian’s grandmothers had known how to spin and weave, and as a little\r\ngirl she herself had seen the old wheels and looms of her ancestors\r\nand had had their workings explained to her. But her childish mind had\r\nunderstood little, and the intervening years had wiped out much of\r\nthat. Still, there remained a little, a wavering memory that she called\r\nup now and caused to supplement her grown-up knowledge of how such\r\nthings must needs be worked out.\r\n\r\n“I need two wheels, Delbert,” she said, “and a band to go from one to\r\nthe other as on mother’s sewing-machine. One wheel must be small, and I\r\nthink this spool will do. Jennie, you can wind off what’s left of the\r\nthread on to this little stick instead. But where can I get the other\r\nwheel? It must be big.”\r\n\r\n“There’s the bottom of the old barrel,” suggested Delbert. “We can make\r\nsomething else to put on the Muggywah to carry things in.”\r\n\r\n“That’s so,” said Marian; “I could burn a hole through the center to\r\nrun an axle through and another one to stick a handle in near the edge\r\nto turn it by.”\r\n\r\n“But doesn’t the wheel have to have a groove on it? Mamma’s machine\r\nwheel did,--grooved, you know, so the band couldn’t slip off.”\r\n\r\n“No, if I remember rightly, the big wheel on grandma’s spinning-wheel\r\nwas very wide, or had a wide tire, and the band was so narrow there\r\nwas no danger of its getting off. There probably was a groove on the\r\nlittle wheel, and our spool will fix that, you see, as well as if it\r\nhad been made specially; but I don’t see my way clear yet to making\r\nthat barrel-bottom carry the band. Maybe I can char the edge and make a\r\ngroove in it.”\r\n\r\nInvestigation proved the bottom of the barrel to be made of two pieces\r\nwhich would come apart as soon as the pressure of the staves was\r\nremoved. That, however, was remedied by nailing two bits of boards\r\nacross the two pieces.\r\n\r\nWhere did she get the nails? Well, she had been saving them up for a\r\nlong time. Two of them had been in Davie’s apron pockets when they\r\ncame to the Island, and one had chanced to be lying in the bottom of\r\nthe lunch-basket. The others had been picked up one time and another in\r\nbits of driftwood on the beaches. Most of these were too crooked and\r\nrusty to be good for much, but there were enough good ones to fasten\r\nthe pieces of the barrel-bottom securely together. Then they knocked\r\noff the hoops and staves and released the round piece, and burned the\r\ncenter hole, and another near the rim to put a handle in to turn it by,\r\nas Marian had said.\r\n\r\nBy this time she had abandoned the idea of charring the edge and\r\nmaking a groove. She gathered a lot of little straight pieces about\r\nfive inches long and varying in width, some round but most little flat\r\npieces, and in the center of each she cut a V-shaped notch and pounded\r\nthem down tight on the edge of the wheel till she had circled it\r\nentirely, in that manner, then tied two strings round near the ends of\r\nthe little sticks to bind them so they would not loosen up and come off.\r\n\r\nShe decided to use the same iron bar for an axle for the wheel to turn\r\non that she had used to burn the holes in it with, and she pounded it\r\ninto a crack in the rock wall of the wickiup. The outer end of the bar\r\nhad a sort of knob on it,--it might once have been a nut,--so that the\r\nwheel would not slip off, and to keep it from wandering in the other\r\ndirection up to the wall she twisted a bit of rope round the bar and\r\ntied it to make a good-sized knot on that side.\r\n\r\nShe was not quite satisfied with the rim of her wheel, and she worked\r\na long while, weaving and winding fiber in and out till she had it\r\nall smooth with no chance of any of the little pieces being knocked\r\nloose. For the rest of her apparatus she had to do some searching for\r\nmaterials. She spent a full half-day up in the pasture before she\r\nfound what she had decided she must have,--a straight little tree that\r\ndivided into two branches about three feet up. She cut it close to the\r\nground and trimmed off the top, leaving the forks about six inches long.\r\n\r\nA piece of driftwood flat on one side was taken for the base, and a\r\nhole was burned in the middle of it and enlarged till the forked stick\r\ncould be inserted and made snug by driving in little pegs where it did\r\nnot fit tight. Two little holes were burned through the two forks. She\r\nused a big old nail to do that, for she did not want such big holes as\r\nthe bar would have made,--besides, the bar was tight in the wall now\r\nwith the big wheel swung on it. A little round stick that fitted snug\r\ninto the spool was then made into a spindle. It turned nicely in the\r\ntwo little burned holes in the forks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SPINNING-WHEEL]\r\n\r\nHowever, the standard was not heavy enough of itself to stand as firmly\r\nas would be required, so one end of the driftwood base was slipped\r\nunder a rock projection, and then Delbert tugged in as big a rock as he\r\ncould lift and set it down on the other end.\r\n\r\nNow all that was lacking was a band to connect the two wheels. Marian\r\ncrocheted this out of fiber, just wide enough to fit the spool.\r\n\r\nAny of the children could turn the big wheel. Even Davie would be able\r\nto when he got up. This left Marian’s hands free to manipulate her\r\ncotton at the spindle.\r\n\r\nProbably no spinning-wheel that was ever built was just like that one,\r\nbut that did not disturb Marian’s equanimity so long as her wheel would\r\nspin, and that it certainly did. True, her yarn was always lumpy;\r\nshe never did get so she could make it nice and smooth, but she was\r\nconvinced that that was the fault of the manipulation of the cotton,\r\nfor the wheel itself went quite swiftly and smoothly.\r\n\r\nAfter she had spun up all their cotton, which included that from the\r\nwild cotton-tree, which she mixed in with that of the now flourishing\r\nbushes in the garden, she got out the little bundle of the combings of\r\ntheir hair, which she had saved ever since about the first of their\r\nbeing on the island, and she finally got that all spun into yarn too.\r\nIt took as much time to prepare her material for spinning as it did\r\nto spin it, but the children helped with the cotton. They all, Davie\r\nincluded, got to be quite expert at picking out cotton seeds.\r\n\r\nThe next problem was weaving. Delbert was unexpectedly helpful at that.\r\nHe knew nothing of his grandmother’s loom, but once upon a time he had\r\nseen a woman weaving a rag carpet, and on that never-to-be-forgotten\r\ntrip with Clarence and his father he had seen an old Indian weaving on\r\na loom.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the son of the old Indian had been blest with a number\r\nof fighting cocks which he was very desirous of showing off to the\r\nAmericans, the small boy had bestowed most of his attention on the\r\npugnacious birds instead of on the sober and less interesting loom;\r\nwith the result that of the two processes that of rag-carpet weaving\r\nwas really the clearer in his mind, though it had been witnessed\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n“There were two rollers,” he told Marian. “One had the threads and\r\none had the carpet, and there were two little frame things something\r\nlike in a beehive, only with strings across, and when one jerked up it\r\nlifted up every other thread, and she’d throw the thing through and\r\nthen the other would jerk up and that lifted the other every other\r\nthread, and she’d throw it back again and pound it down with a stick.”\r\n\r\nMarian drew a long breath. “Delbert,” she said, “it sounds just like a\r\nnightmare.”\r\n\r\nDelbert stared. “Why,” he said, “I can see it just as plain as can be,\r\nonly I can’t remember how it was made.”\r\n\r\n“Probably we couldn’t make one just like it, anyway,” she consoled him.\r\n\r\nIndeed, after much cogitating, she decided that an actual loom was\r\nbeyond their resources, just at that time, at least, and concluded\r\nto weave by the simple method followed by the Indians in weaving the\r\n_fajas_,[6] or narrow sashes the men wear. They had seen this done by\r\nan Indian woman at the Port.\r\n\r\n  [6] Pronounced _fahʹhahss_.\r\n\r\nThis calls for two pairs of forks set in the ground and two round\r\nsticks laid across the forks. The thread for the warp is wound round\r\nthese sticks, from one to the other, over both and then under both,\r\nacross and across, till the sticks are full.\r\n\r\nA thin flat stick is then woven in under one thread and over the next\r\nof the top layer of threads, and then turned up on edge. This makes\r\na space to pass the shuttle through, and the shuttle, by the way, is\r\nsimply a slender stick with the filling wound on it.\r\n\r\nThen the flat stick is pulled out and woven in again and the process\r\nrepeated again and again. As fast as is needed, the round sticks are\r\nturned over, thus turning the woven cloth underneath till all but a few\r\ninches of the warp has been woven. These threads are then cut and form\r\nthe fringe on the ends of the _faja_.\r\n\r\nMarian changed the plan a little. Two little crotches were set in the\r\nfloor of the wickiup just at the right height to be handy to work at.\r\nThey had to dig up the floor to get them set right, but when they were\r\nset, the children smoothed things over and packed the seaweed carpet\r\ndown again.\r\n\r\nA smooth round stick about as big as Marian’s wrist was laid across\r\nthe crotches. The other roller was much smaller around, and instead of\r\nbeing put on a pair of crotches was fastened to the side of the house\r\nwith loops of rope, being just loose enough to turn easily in the\r\nloops.\r\n\r\nThen came the task of wrapping the warp round the two rollers. It had\r\nto be very even and snug, and every once in a while a thread would\r\nbreak and have to be tied, and altogether it called for a good deal of\r\npatience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOOM]\r\n\r\n“I remember,” said Delbert, “that on the carpet the lady wove, this\r\npart was all red and green. She had a wide stripe of red in the middle\r\nand a wide stripe of green out a little way from it on both sides, and\r\nin between were narrow stripes, but, on the very outside, on each\r\nedge, there was a stripe of red just half as wide as the one in the\r\ncenter, and she explained it to me. She said it was so that when the\r\ncarpet was all sewed together it would make a red stripe just the same\r\nsize as the one in the middle. The rags that she put in the other way\r\nwere all kinds of colors.”\r\n\r\n“How came you to remember all that?” asked Jennie.\r\n\r\n“Dunno, but I do.”\r\n\r\nWhen the warp was all ready, Marian tried weaving in the cross-thread\r\nwith her darning-needle, as she would have mended a sock; but that was\r\naltogether too long and tedious a process, so she hunted for a thin\r\nflat stick such as the Indians have, to weave in and turn up on edge to\r\nhold the threads apart, while she slipped through a shuttle which she\r\nmade of a weed stalk. That did better, but was not wholly satisfactory,\r\nand Delbert kept thinking and thinking, trying to remember how that\r\npart of the work had been done on the carpet-loom. He could not get it\r\nentirely clear in his head, but he finally evolved a plan that answered\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nHe arranged a pair of harnesses--though neither he nor Marian knew that\r\nthat was their name--of two sticks wound with thread that looped down\r\nround the threads of the warp. These harnesses were connected by a rope\r\nthat ran over a spool pulley that he fixed in the roof. Marian pulled\r\nthis rope a little; and that lifted one of the harnesses and with it\r\nevery other thread of the warp; she thrust through her weed-stalk\r\nshuttle, then pulled that harness down, which released the upheld\r\nthreads, at the same time lifting the harness and with it all the other\r\nthreads.\r\n\r\nWith this device she could accomplish two or three times as much in the\r\nsame space of time, and she was not at all niggardly in her praise.\r\nDelbert glowed in consequence and, of course, Esther glowed with him.\r\nEven Jennie, who was most apt to be a little skeptical of Delbert’s\r\nabilities, had nothing but the most respectful remarks to offer on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nWith this crude loom they could weave a piece of cloth about a foot\r\nwide by six feet long, and the children were all so interested and\r\neager to work at it, and it was such a simple process, that they all\r\neasily learned; so Marian did not have all the weaving to do.\r\n\r\nMarian had kept Davie’s leg bandaged till she was very sure that it\r\nmust be well knit together, and then she would not have him bear his\r\nweight on it for almost a week after. She was so very ignorant as to\r\nhow such things should be attended to that she simply did not know what\r\nmight happen. So she would undo it every day and bathe and rub and work\r\nwith it and then do it up again, leaving it more and more loose and\r\nfinally gave him permission to walk on it a little, but even then she\r\nkept the splints on it and provided him with a sort of a crutch.\r\n\r\nWhen at last she discarded all bindings and allowed him to go free,\r\nthey watched him most jealously. There was a queer little half-limp\r\nthat Marian saw immediately. She hoped it would pass off in a week or\r\nso, and it did get better, but it never entirely disappeared. In spite\r\nof all her care, something had not been just right, and little King\r\nDavid never walked quite straight again.\r\n\r\nMarion felt much worse about it than he did. As long as he could walk\r\nand run and swim, what did he care if one leg was a trifle shorter\r\nthan the other? He could roam the Island wilds with the rest of them\r\nnow, and that was joy enough.\r\n\r\nMarian hoped his experience would teach him wisdom, and she did her\r\nbest to impress it upon his mind that when she was not there Delbert’s\r\nauthority came next; that, as Delbert was the oldest, it was his duty\r\nto take care of the younger ones, and they must obey him.\r\n\r\nDavie admitted that he had not really needed to look for _panales_,\r\nthat he could plainly see he would have saved himself a great deal of\r\npain and trouble if he had minded Delbert, and he even went so far\r\nas to say of his own accord that he wished he had. Also, at Marian’s\r\nrequest, he promised to be “more good” in the future.\r\n\r\nThis was all she could hope for in that direction, and she took pains\r\nto instruct Delbert, when the others were not present, that, while she\r\nfully intended to back up his authority, at the same time he must take\r\ncare not to issue orders that were not really necessary. She did not\r\nworry about his having trouble with the girls, for Esther would think\r\nanything Delbert wanted was the thing to do, anyway, and Jennie was\r\ngrowing into such a sensible little woman that her judgment could be\r\ndepended upon as well as Delbert’s own; but Delbert was to take care\r\nthat he came pretty near letting Davie have his own way in the minor,\r\nunimportant things and only issue orders to him when there was some\r\nreason for it.\r\n\r\nShe also privately instructed the little girls to use their influence\r\nwhenever they could to keep Davie within bounds and see that he gave\r\nDelbert as little trouble as possible. And there she had to leave the\r\nmatter, trusting for the best, for she could not always go with them\r\nnow, the spinning and weaving and the making of their clothes took\r\nup so much of her time. The children would go off of a morning and\r\nsometimes not be back till nearly noon, coming in laden with fish, or\r\nmaybe clams, or with great armloads of wood.\r\n\r\nWhile they were gone, Marian would clean up the wickiup and work a\r\nwhile among the great mass of poppies and nasturtiums she had growing\r\nabout the house and paths; but the wheel and loom were the principal\r\nthings. She spun her cotton and hair-combings as fine as she could, so\r\nas to make them go as far as possible, and then she was always looking\r\nfor new material. She learned to work in a great deal of fiber without\r\nspinning, especially in the filling, and many and many a morning was\r\nspent in cleaning out banana fiber to be used in her cloth. Oh, there\r\nwas always plenty to keep her busy till the children came back at\r\nnoon. They would be hungry, and there would be dinner to eat, and then\r\nlessons, and afterwards they would help with whatever she had in hand.\r\n\r\nAnd for the lessons she took up another labor, that of making books\r\nof rabbit-skins. She had Delbert bring her some new skins, and she\r\nused part of the old skin clothes, which had been promptly discarded\r\nas fast as she had made new ones. She would trim her pages to the\r\ndesired size and sew them together with fiber or hair. She used her\r\nlittle buttonhole scissors for the cutting, and of course she had real\r\nneedles, though she thought that she could have made shift with thorns\r\nif she had had to. Her ink was brown.\r\n\r\nHer pens were made of quills, and she could not write very nicely\r\nwith them. Fine lines and graceful curves were not easy to achieve\r\nwith them, so she discarded script and “printed” her books, as little\r\nchildren do before they have learned to write.\r\n\r\nI think in time she would have worked out a printing-press to print her\r\nbooks on. Indeed, she did take the first step; she began to make type.\r\nIt began accidentally almost. A pen had gone bad, and in fixing it her\r\nknife slipped and spoiled it altogether. Then, her mind on something\r\nelse, she began toying with it idly and presently cut it square across\r\nand, pressing it down on her wrist, noted the neat _o_ it printed\r\nthere. Then it struck her that if it were inked it would make a better\r\n_o_ than she could with a pen. She tried it, and it worked.\r\n\r\nA second quill cut across and a section taken out made a _c_. It gave\r\nher an idea. Why not make a lot of type? It could not all be made with\r\nquills, but it would be amusing to see what she could do. She whittled\r\nout from bits of wood a capital _A_, and a _W_, and a _D_. She needed\r\nan ink-pad, and made it by padding a chip with cotton and then covering\r\nit with one of her last scraps of lawn.\r\n\r\nHer type worked well enough, but it would be too much bother to whittle\r\nout the whole alphabet. The little letters would be beyond her skill,\r\nanyway, and it would be slower printing one type at a time than it was\r\nwriting them. But by that time she had thought of a way whereby she\r\nmight make a few types serve for the whole alphabet, as all letters are\r\ncomposed of curves and straight lines.\r\n\r\nThe curves she could make of quills, which were finer than anything\r\nshe could whittle out, and the straight lines she made on the end of a\r\nlittle bone, two of them,--one for long lines, one for short ones. Four\r\nquills properly cut furnished her with an assortment of curves, and\r\nshe could hold all six in her left hand between the first and middle\r\nfingers, which was better than laying them down and picking them up\r\neach time she wished to change. It was too much bother to change with\r\nevery letter, too, so she would take one and make all she wanted of\r\nthat kind clear across the page, then she would change and make all\r\nof another kind, and so on. She soon learned to gauge her distances\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nIt was no quicker than writing, but she could put her lines closer\r\ntogether, thus getting more on a page, and her letters were more\r\nuniform, and there were no more blots. It used the ink up faster than\r\nplain writing, for it dried out from the pad, but, as it chanced, there\r\nwere plenty of ink materials.\r\n\r\nThe children were delighted; it was easier to read than the old-time\r\nscript, and it looked so neat and businesslike.\r\n\r\nIn those soft skin books Marian put every poem or set of verses that\r\nshe could remember. She began with Mother Goose rhymes and graded on up\r\nto “The Charge of the Light Brigade” and “Thanatopsis,” which she had\r\nlearned to speak at school. Into one book went Bible verses and several\r\nwhole chapters from the holy book, notably the twenty-third Psalm and\r\nthe thirteenth chapter of First Corinthians.\r\n\r\nAnything and everything pleased the children. They learned to read\r\neverything and to repeat a great deal by heart. Esther especially was a\r\nperfect little parrot and could reel off all kinds of lofty sentiment\r\nof the meaning of which she had no conception. Jennie and Delbert\r\nalways had to study longer on a thing, and Davie, where lessons were\r\nconcerned, was a little lazybones. Davie never learned anything that he\r\ndid not have to, and Marian had such a time getting the fundamentals\r\nwell rooted in his memory that she never tried to plant anything there\r\nthat was not necessary. He was as quick and keen as any of them in\r\nother things, though, and it filled Marian’s heart with pride to see\r\nhow fearless he was in the water and how little he was behind the\r\nothers in that element.\r\n\r\nAs fast as she could, Marian replaced the rabbit-skin clothes with the\r\nnewer, better ones, but the style of making was the same,--low-necked,\r\nsleeveless dresses with rather scant, short skirts, for material was\r\nscarce. Delbert still clung to his “loin-cloth,” and Marian was more\r\nthan willing, it was so much simpler than trousers. Even David, for the\r\nsake of wearing some of the product of their combined labor, consented\r\nto be clothed like Delbert, and as he found a loin-cloth did not impede\r\nhis actions in any way, he continued to sport one from then on. There\r\nwas one thing in favor of the new clothes: they certainly wore well;\r\nthere was no shoddy in them.\r\n\r\nGradually Jennie spent more and more time at the wickiup. For one\r\nthing, the children did not like to go off and leave Marian alone\r\nall the morning, and as Davie was growing so big that he could help\r\nappreciably, there was really no need for so many of them on the\r\nmorning excursions.\r\n\r\nSo Jennie stayed with Marian. Her particular forte was making baskets.\r\nJennie could make beautiful baskets. She wove them of straws and tough\r\nweeds and palm-leaf. Her only teachers were her memories of certain\r\nkindergarten lessons, the big basket they had brought their lunch in,\r\nand a rather blurry picture down in one corner of the old newspaper\r\nof a half-dozen Indian baskets with strange designs. For the rest she\r\ntaught herself, and when she once got interested in the work she wanted\r\nto do nothing else.\r\n\r\nIt was Jennie who made a basket of split palm-leaves to take the place\r\nof the old barrel on the Muggywah. She would sit for hours on the\r\nseaweed carpet of the wickiup, leaning against the pile of bedding,\r\nand weave and weave, the work growing much faster under her slim brown\r\nfingers than it did under Marian’s. Indeed, after Jennie took to making\r\nbaskets, Marian and the rest quit. What was the use of their wasting\r\ntheir time when Jennie could do it so much better and quicker?\r\n\r\nShe made big baskets to carry wood and clams in; she made little ones\r\nto hang up in the wickiup to drop little pieces of moss and seashells\r\ninto. She loved the little ones best. She made them in patterns. She\r\ncolored some of her material a dull red with juice from the cactus\r\nfruit and some of it brown with Marian’s ink. She used some kinds of\r\nseaweed, and she made one basket with a row of starfish around the edge\r\nand over the handle, and she made some with lids. When Marian’s hat\r\nwore out, Jennie made her a new one, weaving it as she did her baskets\r\nand trimming it with sprays of seaweed and shells.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary rains did not inconvenience them, but when they were very\r\nsevere the wickiup leaked a little down the rock wall. They had not\r\nbeen able to make the roof perfectly tight there, and the water, when\r\nthe wind blew hard, would find its way down; then they would have to\r\nremove whatever was hanging or leaning against that side, and Marian\r\nwould turn back the seaweed carpet so that it should not get wet, and\r\nthe water would run down the wall and soak into the sand and rocks of\r\nthe floor. They enjoyed the big rains, though. They could always keep\r\nwarm and dry, and the wickiup was big enough to allow each one to move\r\nabout a little and follow whatever occupation he or she chose.\r\n\r\nIt was on a rainy day that Marian conceived the idea of weaving up the\r\nold rags that had been their clothes into new cloth, though the task\r\nwas not finished on that one day by any means, nor in two. She had used\r\nup everything she had on hand in the way of thread; so she made the\r\nwarp out of new hair clipped from her own and the children’s heads with\r\nthe buttonhole scissors; and with the same sharp little instrument she\r\ncut the old rags into strips, as narrow as she could and have them hold\r\ntogether at all, and wove them in as rag carpets are woven; and lo! she\r\nhad new towels, and they needed new towels very much.\r\n\r\nSo time passed, rainy season and cold weather and rainy season again.\r\nOften at night they built brush fires out on the rocks where they could\r\nbe seen a long way off. Their signal flag had been blown down one\r\nstormy night and lost altogether.\r\n\r\nSometimes, far out, they saw canoes and started out in the Muggywah to\r\nintercept them, but the canoes always went on their way too fast and\r\ntoo far to be overtaken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IT SEEMED AS IF THEY MUST SURELY HAVE SEEN OR HEARD HER]\r\n\r\nOnce, when the children were gone in the Muggywah after eggs, Marian\r\nsighted a canoe and started to swim out to it with only a piece of\r\ndriftwood to help keep her afloat. She got so close to them that it\r\nseemed as if they must surely have seen or heard her, but they put up\r\ntheir sail, and, despairing, she had to see them depart. Giving up the\r\nchase, she rested a little before battling her way slowly back, but\r\nshe arrived so tired that she could scarcely drag herself out of the\r\nwater and across the beach, to find the children returned and hunting\r\ndesperately for her.\r\n\r\nThen one day they hauled the Muggywah up on the beach for repairs. Two\r\nof the sticks driven through the burnt holes had broken, and they were\r\ngoing to put in new ones. They took it apart and rolled the logs up\r\nbeyond the soft sand into the shade of a mesquite tree that grew at the\r\nfoot of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe next day they found the material they had got was not so good\r\nas they had thought it was, and so they spent the day hunting for\r\nsomething better. And that night came the second big storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDISASTER AND A NEW TASK\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm was fully as severe as the one that had welcomed the children\r\nto the Island, though they did not realize what they were in for till\r\nmidnight. When it began to blow so strong that they were really sure a\r\nstorm was coming, Delbert took their best ropes and securely moored the\r\nlogs of the Muggywah to the tree, thinking it barely possible that the\r\nwaves might reach up to them if the wind kept on increasing. And such a\r\nterrible wind as it threatened to be!\r\n\r\nThey turned the little burros loose with their mothers,--there were\r\nfour of them that year,--and the one little pig that they happened to\r\nhave in the pen was also turned out to seek its shelter where it chose.\r\nThe little girls tried to get it into the wickiup, but it was wild and\r\nescaped them, and Marian told them to let it go, that it would take\r\ncare of itself.\r\n\r\nThey gathered in the best of the melons, for there was no knowing if\r\nthere would be one left by morning, the sandy point was so low; and\r\nthey piled up a great stack of wood and _pitalla_ by the fireplace; and\r\nthen it was too dark to do any more.\r\n\r\nThe wind howled and the waves broke on the beach like mighty thunders.\r\nThe thatch of their roof struggled to be gone, and the water poured\r\ndown the wall in a steady sheet. Fortunately, it could soak through\r\nthe sand and rocks of the floor and run off down the hill as fast as\r\nit came in; otherwise they would have been flooded. The window and the\r\nstorm doors were tied as tightly as possible, and Marian watched them\r\nclosely and thanked her stars that she had insisted on taking such\r\nendless pains to have everything about the house solid and sure.\r\n\r\nOf course, they were protected somewhat by the cliff, and the girl\r\nshuddered to think what would have happened had they not been. She\r\nimagined how it would seem to go crawling through the fury of the\r\nstorm, holding to one another’s hands, beaten to the ground and half\r\ndrowned, and finally reaching the old Cave, the only possible other\r\nshelter, and crawling in, soaked and chilled, to lie, packed like\r\nsardines in a box, till morning.\r\n\r\nIt was not a pleasant picture; she was glad to come back to the\r\nreality,--the interior of the wickiup, somewhat disorderly with so\r\nmuch wood and everything piled away from the rock wall, but warm and\r\ndry and safe; Delbert stretched out by the fireplace, a great strong\r\nboy, his eyes, steady and straightforward, regarding the flames as they\r\nspluttered in protest against the water that found its way down the\r\nchimney; Davie sprawling at her feet, sleeping in utter carelessness of\r\nthe storm, well knowing that whatever happened he would be taken care\r\nof; the two girls on a blanket beyond him, awake, and Jennie a little\r\nnervous but Esther calmly confident that everything would turn out all\r\nright,--that they were, and would continue to be, safe.\r\n\r\nMarian’s throat swelled a little as she watched them. How dear they\r\nwere, every one, and so big and strong now, even Davie! Surely now,\r\nwhen this storm was over and the Muggywah repaired, they might start\r\nback to the Port. The first few miles outside the shelter of the bay\r\nwould be the worst. The waves were always very big and high out there,\r\nbut after that,--well, they might not make very good time, but what\r\nmattered it if they were a week on the way, so they got there at last?\r\nThey could take food and water with them, though for that matter they\r\ncould go hungry and thirsty if need be; what mattered it so they got\r\nhome?\r\n\r\nAll that night the wind tore at them; all the next day it screamed\r\nabout their ears, and the breakers on the beach were like great guns\r\nof a battle. The next night it calmed down, and the next morning they\r\nsallied forth to take account of the damage done.\r\n\r\nThey found a considerable amount of damage,--the felling of many banana\r\nplants, half the patch in fact, the complete disappearance of every\r\nmelon vine on the point, every plant in the garden beaten into the\r\nground, the little pig gone, and their carefully gathered woodpile\r\nscattered to the four winds. But all this sank into insignificance\r\nbeside the fact that not one log of the Muggywah was left to them. The\r\ntree had been uprooted and washed away bodily, and all search up and\r\ndown the beaches revealed no trace of it. The great storm had cast many\r\ntreasures at their feet, but they were so dispirited over their losses\r\nthat they could not be very joyful over the gains.\r\n\r\nMechanically they lugged the wood up out of reach of the waves, which\r\nwere still pounding angrily, gathered in a number of new bottles, and\r\ntook note of the great masses of seaweed that would make fresh carpet\r\nwhen it was dry. But with all the wood there was no log like those of\r\nthe lost Muggywah, and with all their gazing to sea they could not see\r\nanything that might of a bare possibility be an uprooted tree.\r\n\r\nThey fashioned a poor sort of a raft out of the best pieces of the\r\ndriftwood, and with its aid explored the outer reefs and _esteros_\r\nand even as far as the egg islands. The raft was clumsy and slow and\r\ngenerally unmanageable, and Delbert said that it made him sick just\r\nto look at it, but they wanted to go longer distances than they could\r\nswim, and the float was made to serve.\r\n\r\nAt the end of about two weeks, however, Delbert said: “It’s no use,\r\nMarian. We are only wasting time. The Muggywah simply did not lodge\r\nanywhere near us. Maybe it didn’t lodge at all; it may be going yet, in\r\nthree different directions, and our best ropes with it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, more’s the pity, Delbert. I hate losing your hair rope about as\r\nbad as losing the Muggywah herself.”\r\n\r\n“Well,”--and the boy’s jaw set solid and square,--“there’s not a bit\r\nmore use crying over a lost boat than there is in crying over spilt\r\nmilk. We can’t find it, and we haven’t got a stick of timber fit to\r\nput into a new one either. We can’t walk back to the Port; it would be\r\nhundreds of miles to follow the coast line, and we should be sure to\r\nget lost if we tried any short cuts. If Davie was a couple of years\r\nolder, I’d say to risk it. But we aren’t going to wait two more years.\r\nI want to see mother.” His voice broke a little, but he conquered it\r\nand went on. “There is only one thing to do; it has been in my head\r\nkind of hazy for some time, but now I’ve got it clear; we must fix the\r\nold canoe, Marian.”\r\n\r\n“How?” asked Marian quietly, for she had never been able to think of\r\nany way to do that.\r\n\r\n“Well, we must put a framework in the side that is gone, the hole, you\r\nknow. I’m not sure yet just what is the best material, but I think\r\npalm-leaf stems would be,--we can burn holes through the canoe to\r\nfasten to,--a solid framework, that will not break and give way at any\r\nlittle tap, and as near the shape of the other side as we can make it.\r\nThen we’ll weave in basketwork, strong as we can, and, as we go, pack\r\nall the cracks full of fiber and _pitalla_ tar. I’ve got it all studied\r\nout, Marian. We’ll weave the basketwork double with a space between,\r\nand in that space we can put stones, just enough to make that side of\r\nthe canoe as heavy as the other. We’ll mix the fiber and tar together\r\nand pound it down as we go along, and when it’s all finished, if there\r\ncome any cracks, we can fill them in with cotton and tar, and if we\r\ncan’t jam it in tight enough so but what it still leaks some, why, one\r\nof us can bail all the time.”\r\n\r\n“Do you know how to make _pitalla_ tar?”\r\n\r\nDelbert threw up his head.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I do! That is _one_ thing I saw made that I paid enough attention\r\nto to know how it was done. Bobbie’s Uncle Jim used to try it out.\r\nDon’t you remember? He had a place fixed down by the old blacksmith\r\nshop, and we kids were always fooling around there, and he showed and\r\nexplained all about it to us.”\r\n\r\n“And for a wonder you listened?” asked Jennie.\r\n\r\n“For a wonder I listened,” he answered, smiling grimly.\r\n\r\n“Good boy!” said Marian. “From now on we bend our energies to the\r\ncanoe. When it is done, we won’t wait for anything more,--once we can\r\nsail it,--we won’t wait for anything more except a still day. The first\r\nstill day we’ll start for home.”\r\n\r\nDelbert had a great time making a retort to extract his tar. He found a\r\nplace near High-Tide Pool where there was a hole in the rock which he\r\ncould utilize, and he built it up with stones and earth till it suited\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThen they began gathering the _pitalla_. They had gathered everything\r\nnear them for the fireplace, but they knew where there was plenty more\r\nto be had, so they went after it,--up the _estero_, past the tide-flats\r\ntoward the lagoon. There they could gather it, pile it high on the\r\nclumsy raft, and float it home as they had brought the thatch-grass.\r\nIt was slow work, but there was no other way. It was not so easy to\r\nget down to the _estero_ as the grass had been, for the _pitalla_ is\r\nthorny indeed, but they managed it somehow, because they had to. They\r\ncould gather a good deal on the shores nearer home, but nowhere was\r\nthere such an abundance as beyond that particular _estero_.\r\n\r\nThey decided, however, never to leave the home Island alone. They had\r\nseen several canoes since the storm, and they hoped one might come into\r\nSan Moros and near enough to be signaled. Delbert and the girls were\r\nperfectly capable of gathering the _pitalla_ and bringing it home; so\r\nMarian and Davie stayed at home to do the work there and watch the bay\r\nfor canoes.\r\n\r\nMarian put in a little garden, for they could not tell how long it\r\nmight take them to finish the canoe, and she planted part of the\r\nmelon-patch over again, thinking that what they did not reap perhaps\r\nsome one else would. She straightened up the bananas and mended the\r\nfence where they had dragged the old canoe out of it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had got quite a little pile of _pitalla_, they began to\r\nburn it in the retort, and some one had to watch that and attend to it.\r\nDelbert was sure that he lost a great deal of tar because his retort\r\nwas so crude. He was sure Bobbie’s Uncle Jim got much more out of a\r\npile of _pitalla_ than he did, but he had to manage as best he could.\r\nAnd the tar did come; it trickled down into the little dishpan slowly\r\nbut surely, and Delbert, impatient though he was, would set his face\r\ntoward the _estero_ and bring more _pitalla_.\r\n\r\nEvery morning the three were in such a hurry to get off that they did\r\nnot stop for a hot breakfast, and they took only a light lunch with\r\nthem for noon, but Marian always had a good hot meal ready for them\r\nupon their return. The destruction of the garden was a drawback, for\r\nthe little new one was not of service yet. Still, not all the plants\r\nhad been destroyed by the storm; some had been rescued, straightened\r\nup, washed, and tied to stakes, and were pursuing the even tenor of\r\ntheir way again, and, of course, the turnips and carrots that had\r\nalready attained their growth were as good as ever, and the newly\r\nplanted seeds would soon be making quite a showing.\r\n\r\nTwice since the storm Delbert had killed a deer, and the meat was not\r\nallowed to spoil. What could not be cooked immediately was salted and\r\ndried, some of it smoked, and all was watched carefully to thwart the\r\nflies. When the raft came back at night it would bring game of some\r\nkind,--a rabbit killed in the brush of the shore or a fish speared\r\non the way down the _estero_. These would be put into the kettle\r\nand left simmering over the coals till morning, or wrapped in green\r\nbanana leaves and buried in the hot coals, to be raked out hastily for\r\nbreakfast; and of the remnants Marian would make a stew to have piping\r\nhot for supper, flanked by a dish of greens which she and Davie had\r\npicked.\r\n\r\nAs they ran across them, the children brought in other things that they\r\nneeded,--tough sticks, or mescal plants to make ropes of,--and Davie\r\nwas always waiting for them on the pier to see what the particular\r\nbooty of the day was and to carry it up to the wickiup to show Marian.\r\nAnd Marian always had warm water ready for them, and when they had\r\nwashed off the day’s accumulation of dirt and combed the tangled hair\r\nand braided it anew,--they did not stop for that in the morning,--they\r\nwould sit down and eat; and they always ate all Marian had prepared for\r\nthem, too, and then filled up on bananas and chattered and chattered\r\nlike a flock of birds all the time. Then they would go down and unload\r\nthe _pitalla_ and carry it over to the retort, and by that time they\r\nwere ready to settle down in the wickiup in front of the _pitalla_ fire\r\nfor a rest.\r\n\r\nThere would be a very short session of school then, a little reading\r\nfrom the rabbit-skin book, a review of the multiplication or division\r\ntables, and a spelling-lesson. It was not much; Marian had got them\r\nabout as far as she could without books, and it did not seem as if\r\nit mattered so much, now that the home-going was, as you might say,\r\nin sight. They always sang in the evenings. Their mother had come of\r\na musical family, and Marian had taught them all the songs she knew,\r\nand there was not one of them that could not sing sweet and clear and\r\nstrong. Marian gloried in their voices and knew that her mother would\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nAnd she always had to tell them a story after lessons were over. They\r\nsaid that was Marian’s lesson. She had become quite expert at it.\r\nUsually it was a rehashing of some dimly remembered thing that she\r\nhad read, but sometimes it was a pure product of her imagination. If\r\nit was an Indian story, why, so much the better, for the tribe never\r\nforgot that it _was_ a tribe, though sometimes the Indian names and\r\npretenses would be dropped for several weeks, only to be taken up with\r\nrenewed vigor later.\r\n\r\nWhen Marian thought that it was long enough since they had eaten, and\r\nabout bedtime,--her watch had stopped the year before,--they would go\r\ndown to the water and have their swim. Sometimes the water was pretty\r\ncold, but they were so used to it that they did not stop for that any\r\nmore. Once in a while Davie was left asleep at the wickiup, but as a\r\nrule he went with them.\r\n\r\nThey would take the raft away out from shore and have oceans of fun\r\nplunging from it, diving, swimming races, floating, in short doing\r\neverything that could be done in the water.\r\n\r\nA favorite game was “rescue.” One of them would fall overboard with\r\na yell of “Oh, save me!” and then do as little as possible to help\r\nhimself, while another one would dive in after him and those on the\r\nraft would paddle it off a little, so as to give the gallant rescuer\r\nscope for his or her endeavors. They got so that there was not one of\r\nthem--except Davie--who could not take care of himself and one other\r\nin the water, and even Davie could make a very respectable stagger at\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDelbert and Esther were the best swimmers; they could do the most\r\ndifficult stunts. In a straight swim, though, Marian would outlast\r\nEsther, while Jennie fell considerably behind her.\r\n\r\nMoonlight nights were best for this play. Marian, her paddle in hand,\r\nwatched them with exultation in her heart, they were so strong and\r\nfull of grace; and they were hers,--she had thought, studied, prayed,\r\nwatched, and worked for them. Once she had read a novel whose hero had\r\nbeen described as being “straight and handsome as a young god.” That\r\nwas the phrase that always came into her mind out there on the raft as\r\nshe watched Delbert,--“straight and handsome as a young god,”--but she\r\nnever said it aloud.\r\n\r\nAnd Jennie,--puny, sickly little Jennie, always the least pretty of\r\nthem all,--how slim and lovely she stood in the moonlight, her hair\r\nin two dripping braids, her eyes like shining stars! It fairly took\r\nMarian’s breath away sometimes to realize what a winsome beauty was\r\ngrowing to be Jennie’s. She had always expected Esther to be pretty,\r\nbut that Jennie should blossom out like this!\r\n\r\nSometimes the water was full of phosphorescence. This was, of course,\r\nmore noticeable on dark nights, and then every move they made was a\r\npale blaze. That was better than moonlight; it was magic; it was a\r\nfairyland made real. Then they quit playing they were Indians and\r\nplayed they were mermaids and sea-goblins of the deep. The raft was\r\na Spanish galleon wrecked in ages past and drifting still, filled\r\nwith treasure. Just see how the jewels gleamed! Or it was a great sea\r\nturtle, ridden by sea nymphs, plunging and careering, unable to throw\r\noff its tormentors. Then it was foam of the waves, unsubstantial and\r\nformless, and the fish that came scurrying by in silver flashes were\r\nchased in glee.\r\n\r\nIt was always hard to coax them back to land on these nights, but\r\nsooner or later they had to go, and they would then huddle about the\r\nfire a little, drying their hair, before they lay down to sleep soundly\r\ntill morning. Then early the three would be up and off, generally\r\ntaking their breakfast with them to eat on the way up the _estero_,\r\nwhile Marian and Davie took up their daily tasks.\r\n\r\nDavie found it a little lonesome with Delbert and the girls gone all\r\nday, but he was such a sunny-tempered little chap that he managed\r\npretty well after all. There were his lessons, which went much faster\r\nand smoother than they had done at first, and then he helped Marian do\r\neverything, even cook. And he made little boats and sailed them, and\r\nhe rode on Jackie, who was growing very steady and sedate this year,\r\nand he gathered in wood and crabs. Always he watched for little shells\r\nand other treasures of the sea, to bring to Marian for her inspection,\r\nas she sat weaving or writing in the rabbit-skin books. It was at this\r\ntime that she wrote out “Thanatopsis,” all but six lines that she could\r\nnot for the life of her remember.\r\n\r\nShe kept her subconscious mind on the retort and went out every so\r\noften to attend to it, for all things now were subordinate to the\r\ntarring of that canoe. When the little dishpan was full of _pitalla_\r\ntar and they had a nice big pile of _pitalla_ on hand, they decided to\r\nbegin on the work. So they dragged the canoe into the water at the\r\npier and paddled it round to the other side of the Island and dragged\r\nit up high on the beach not far from the tar retort. Then they began\r\nthe main task to which all these weeks had been preparatory.\r\n\r\nMarian left the housework and cooking to the girls; they could spear\r\nthe fish and gather the greens and cook them, they could boil down\r\nthe salt water and take it out on the raft to the reef and bring\r\nback the dry salt, and they could watch the dry meat and gather the\r\nbananas. The older sister and Delbert devoted their time to the canoe.\r\nThere were holes to be burned and the toughest and strongest of pegs\r\nto be whittled and driven in; there was much testing of materials,\r\nmuch discussion of ways and means, much sighting and squinting and\r\nbalancing. This work must be done right.\r\n\r\nSlowly the framework grew. The basket work would be made entirely of\r\nthe split palm stems, or, if there were not enough of them, they would\r\nput the next best thing on the top.\r\n\r\nThey tipped the old canoe into the best position to work on and propped\r\nit up with stakes and stones. And when the framework was finished,\r\nthey called in Jennie for her opinion on the next step. So she worked\r\ntoo, for none of them could weave so well--so neatly and tightly--as\r\nshe. And as she wove, Marian and Delbert began packing in the tarred\r\nfiber. It took a lot of it, but Delbert thought that, if they ran out\r\nentirely, they could, perhaps, use some kinds of seaweed at the top\r\nwhere it would not matter so much.\r\n\r\nEgging-time came and went. They stopped work long enough to go for eggs\r\nonce, and then Davie and the girls went alone, or Davie and Esther,\r\nwhile the three older ones worked steadily on the canoe.\r\n\r\nThey had it about two-thirds done and were shifting it into a different\r\nposition one day and propping it up, when Esther and Davie came running\r\ndown the hill laughing. They had been off in the pasture. As soon as\r\nshe got within calling distance Esther began to shout, “Davie’s found a\r\n_panal_! Davie’s found a _panal_!”\r\n\r\n“Don’t believe it,” said Delbert shortly.\r\n\r\n“Have,” declared Davie, coming up with a grin reaching from one ear\r\nround to the other. “Have, too. ’S whopper. Heap big chief me. Find\r\nwhopper _panal_. All the tribe eat.”\r\n\r\nMarian smiled indulgently. “Great brave, Hiawatha! Where did you find\r\nit? Where Pocahontas had just pointed it out to you?”\r\n\r\n“No,” with great scorn; “I saw it myself. _I_ pointed it out to _her_.”\r\n\r\n“Is that so, Pocahontas?” asked Marian, still smiling.\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is,” declared Esther; “and it is a big one, bigger than we\r\never had before, and we have been by it lots of times and none of us\r\never saw it before. Come on, Marian, let’s have it for supper. We\r\nhaven’t had one for a year.”\r\n\r\n“I guess we haven’t,” agreed Marian. “Somehow _panales_ are not very\r\nplenty. What do you say, Delbert? Shall we knock off work and take in\r\nthis newly discovered and most marvelously large _panal_?”\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Delbert, throwing down his stake. “Let me fix the\r\nretort first.”\r\n\r\nSo they all trooped off and were soon _en route_ to the pasture. It was\r\na big _panal_, and it was so near to the path that it was a thousand\r\nwonders that they had never seen it before, with all those little\r\nworkers flying back and forth. But then it was a long way from the\r\nwickiup, and they had been so busy with the canoe lately that they had\r\nnot been much in the pasture; and probably it had grown pretty fast and\r\na few weeks earlier would not have shown much.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, they took their toll of the little workers now, taking\r\ncare to leave enough of the center for them to build on again and going\r\noff with their booty in the kettle and pail well covered. They had not\r\ngone far when they came upon the deer, and, of course, Delbert must\r\ntry for a shot. He could have got one, a little fawn, but his heart\r\nforbade. It was such a dainty little darling that he wouldn’t have\r\nminded catching it alive, but as long as there was other food he would\r\nnot kill it.\r\n\r\nIt was past noon as they wended their way back. Those who were not\r\ncarrying honey gathered up wood. Davie was ahead. As they came out by\r\nthe rock where the path wound smoothly down to the pier, Davie stopped\r\nsuddenly and let his wood fall to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Look!” he said excitedly. “What’s that? Is that a canoe by the pier?”\r\n\r\nThey all looked.\r\n\r\n“Canoe!” said Delbert in a queer, quiet voice. “That’s the launch.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHOW THE LAUNCH CAME BACK TO SMUGGLERS’\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Hadleys had left Mexico they had turned their steps toward\r\nCalifornia. They had some friends there, but the place they finally\r\nbought was not near any of them. It was many miles inland, too, for\r\nMrs. Hadley had said she did not want to live by the ocean.\r\n\r\n“All my life I have been fond of it,” she said, “but now I don’t want\r\never to have to see it again.”\r\n\r\nSo they had settled down on a little fruit farm in the interior.\r\n\r\nThey are not cheap, those little fruit farms of California. The price\r\nasked per acre is usually enough to make your head swim till you get\r\nused to it, and the Hadleys were not rich, which explains the fact that\r\nevery cent they had in the world was not enough to pay for that farm.\r\nBut they paid over what they had and set out to raise the rest from the\r\nfarm itself. In a few years they had succeeded.\r\n\r\nNeither of them was old yet; they could still work, and did work. But\r\nMrs. Hadley’s face was quieter than it had been in former years, though\r\nshe went about patient and cheerful, a busy, kindly woman much beloved\r\nby her neighbors.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley was older than his wife by a number of years. He was\r\nbeginning to turn gray when their sorrow came to them, and his hair\r\nwhitened rapidly after that, and somehow he did not seem so tall as\r\nhe had been; but, aside from that, one would not have seen any great\r\nchange in him.\r\n\r\nThey made a fair living, nothing more, out of the farm. Sometimes\r\nthere is drought, you know, or there is failure of crops for some\r\nother reason, or the crop is too large and then prices go down, and\r\ntransportation takes most of the profits in any case. And because of\r\nall these things the Hadleys had been in California over six years\r\nbefore they felt free to take a little visiting-trip among their\r\nfriends who lived in the State.\r\n\r\nThey had to plan most carefully then to keep within the limits of their\r\nvery modest income, for already there loomed on the horizon of the\r\nfuture the expenses of the coming season. But they went and had a good\r\ntime, being heartily welcomed everywhere, and nowhere more heartily\r\nthan at the Harrises’, the last place on their list. The Harrises had\r\nbeen old neighbors at the Port, being in fact none other than the\r\nfamily who numbered among its members the Clarence to whom the Island\r\nHawks felt that they owed so much.\r\n\r\nClarence was not a boy now; he was a man grown, but he still lived at\r\nhome and helped his father run a fruit ranch of about four times the\r\nsize of that of the Hadleys. A man grown he was, but in many respects\r\nthe same boy, as was proved by the way his widowed sister’s children\r\ntrailed at his heels all day.\r\n\r\nThe Hadleys arrived in the evening, and it was not till the next day\r\nat noon that the conversation turned upon their loss at the Port. The\r\nHarrises had heard about the happening at the time, for Mrs. Harris\r\ncorresponded with Bobbie’s mother, and they had received, too, several\r\nnewspapers containing reports of the occurrence, these having been\r\nmarked and sent out by Mr. Cunningham to various persons to whom he\r\nknew the event would be of interest. But there were, of course, details\r\nthat they had never heard, and it was only natural that they should ask\r\nfor the story and that Mr. Hadley should tell it over as they sat about\r\nthe table after the main part of the meal had been eaten.\r\n\r\nClarence was sitting between his lively little niece and nephew,\r\ncracking walnuts for them, picking the meats out into their eager\r\nlittle hands, and making little boats and turtles of the shells. The\r\nlittle boy had slipped down and brought him the mucilage-bottle, a\r\npiece of stiff paper, and his grandmother’s best shears, purloined from\r\nher basket with many sideways glances.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley told the tale quietly. They were undemonstrative people, and\r\nafter these years they could talk of this quite without emotion. He\r\ntold it all,--all the little incidents,--how Esther had been sent for\r\nthe forgotten bathing-suits the evening before; how Marian had started\r\nout without sufficient wraps and Bobbie’s mother had made her take her\r\nbig cape; of the question Mr. Faston put to them as they were going\r\ndown to the pier and Delbert’s answer. Of the long search and nothing\r\nto pay for it save the little handkerchief beaten into the sand. The\r\nothers asked a question now and then during the recital, but Clarence\r\nsat silent, letting no word of the story escape him, but making no\r\ncomments as he worked quietly on the little shell boats.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Hadley finished, he laid his shipbuilding tools down by his\r\nshell-littered plate, and, looking into the white-haired father’s eyes,\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Hadley,” he said, “Smugglers’ Island was not within fifty miles of\r\nthe Rosalie Group.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one of the busy seaport towns of our Pacific Coast Mr. Hadley sat\r\nat a little restaurant table, eating an inexpensive meal alone. Every\r\ncent that he and his wife possessed in the wide world had gone into\r\nthat little fruit farm up in the hills, and now by means of a mortgage\r\non it he had raised money enough to carry him back to the coast to take\r\nup the old heart-breaking task. His passage was already engaged on a\r\nsteamer to sail for the Port the next day. Mrs. Hadley remained on the\r\nfarm to carry on the work there as best she could alone.\r\n\r\nIf this were a model story, Clarence would most assuredly have gone\r\nwith his old neighbor, but in real life people do not start on journeys\r\nunless they have the railroad or steamship fare, which Clarence did not\r\nhave. It takes money to travel, and ordinary people cannot get money\r\nso easily that they can afford to spend it on anything that is not\r\nstrictly necessary. Certainly Clarence wanted badly enough to go and\r\nshow the way to Smugglers’ and search for his old playmates, but the\r\nbest he could actually do was to make a map of the coast and San Moros\r\nas well as he could remember it, and give it to Mr. Hadley, with the\r\nname of the old Indian who had told him about Smugglers’ in the first\r\nplace, but who, doubtless, had slept with his fathers for years now.\r\n\r\nWhat did Mr. Hadley expect to find on Smugglers’? Certainly not his\r\nliving children, for had they lived through the storm, even though the\r\nlaunch were disabled or destroyed, Pearson would have found some way\r\nto get back. No; it was only a confirmation of death which the father\r\nlooked for at best, something to show where and how his children had\r\nperished,--some fragment of the launch, perhaps, all but buried in the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nAs he sat eating, there came slowly into his consciousness a face at a\r\ntable near him. He looked at it. Surely it had not been there when he\r\ncame in. Whose was it? Why did it seem to claim his attention more than\r\nthe dozen others on all sides? He tried to resume his meal, but--who\r\nwas that man? where had he seen that face before?\r\n\r\nIn a blinding flash it came to him. It was Pearson! Pearson, the man\r\nwhom Cunningham had sent with Marian and the children in the launch.\r\nBut, of course, that could not be. Pearson was dead,--dead these nearly\r\nseven years ago,--but this fellow--\r\n\r\nJust then the man looked up and met his gaze. It was the look of a\r\ncomplete stranger. Mr. Hadley politely dropped his eyes. But he did not\r\ndrop his thinking, and so keenly conscious was he of that face that he\r\nknew instantly when the other rose from the table.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley glanced up again. The other was leaving his dinner\r\nalmost untouched. Mr. Hadley himself arose. His memory for faces was\r\nremarkably good; that man had Pearson’s face, he might be a brother; at\r\nany rate, he would speak to him; it could not be Pearson, but why was\r\nhe leaving his dinner uneaten?\r\n\r\nThe man, who was sauntering out apparently without haste, glanced back\r\nand saw Mr. Hadley advancing toward him, and a look came over his face\r\nthat Mr. Hadley did not mistake. In a flash he knew it _was_ Pearson;\r\nimpossible as it seemed, it _was_ Pearson, and he was afraid!\r\n\r\nA moment or two later a placid policeman just turning a corner was\r\nknocked nearly off his feet and out of his dignity by a man coming\r\nfrom the opposite direction, a man past middle age with white hair and\r\nflashing eyes.\r\n\r\n“Officer,” he cried, grasping the representative of the law by the arm,\r\n“arrest that man! the one in brown with the striped coat!”\r\n\r\n“What’s the charge?” inquired the policeman.\r\n\r\n“There will be charge enough,” cried the other; and from his\r\nearnestness and the rapidity with which the striped coat was\r\ndisappearing down the street, the policeman concluded that the owner\r\nof it needed arresting and started forthwith in pursuit.\r\n\r\nWithin two blocks he had two of his brother officers chasing with him,\r\nand farther on they gathered up another one, to say nothing of the\r\nseveral onlookers who joined for the pure pleasure of the chase.\r\n\r\nThe policemen were used to chasing men, but Mr. Hadley was not, and\r\nin spite of his utmost efforts he was soon left in the rear. As he\r\nkept on, panting and puffing, and seeing more and more ground stretch\r\nbetween himself and the bluecoats, and was finally left out of sight\r\naltogether, it came over him what a good idea it would have been for\r\nthem to have carried paper scent, as the boys used to when they played\r\nhare and hounds, for now they were like to catch their man so far away\r\nthat he would never be able to find them.\r\n\r\nAnd, indeed, it was a long and merry chase, and when it came to an end,\r\nas luck would have it, a patrol-wagon was just passing, and into it the\r\ntriumphant bluecoats thrust their man in the striped coat, one of them\r\ngoing with him while the rest dispersed, the first retracing his steps\r\ntill he met the breathless Mr. Hadley.\r\n\r\n“Got him? Of course we got him. He’s safe enough, never you worry. You\r\ncan go down and appear against him in the morning.”\r\n\r\n“In the morning!” gasped Mr. Hadley. “In the morning! I’m not waiting\r\ntill morning. It’s right now that I want to talk to him!”\r\n\r\nThe officer regarded him a moment, and then, “Would yer mind tellin’ me\r\nwhat the man has been doin’?” he inquired.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley leaned against a building till he had regained his breath\r\nand his self-control.\r\n\r\n“Six or seven years ago,” he said, “my five children went out in a\r\nlittle gasoline launch for a day’s excursion. That man went with them\r\nto run the launch for them. We never saw them again and could get no\r\ntrace of them, and supposed they had all drowned together. But to-day\r\nI ran across him, and when he saw that I recognized him and was going\r\nto speak to him, he ran. You will understand that I can’t wait till\r\nto-morrow to know what became of my children.”\r\n\r\nThe officer glanced at his watch. “My own time is up,” he said. “I’ll\r\nwalk up with you.”\r\n\r\n“Take your time an’ get your breath back,” he added presently. “He is\r\nsafe enough; ’twas Larry O’Flannagan had him by the shoulder, an’ no\r\nman ever yet broke from Larry’s grip when he once got a good grip on\r\n’im. He’s safe enough.”\r\n\r\nSafe enough he certainly was, and an hour later he stood face to face\r\nwith the father of the Hadley children.\r\n\r\n“You’ve made a mistake,” he repeated. “You’ve made a mistake. My name\r\nis not Pearson. My name is Franks, John Franks. I never lived in the\r\nPort; never was across the line into Mexico at all, in fact. No, I\r\nnever saw you before, not to my knowledge at least.”\r\n\r\nHe said it all over again stubbornly, and, with dark and scowling face,\r\nhe declared that Mr. Hadley would be sorry for this trouble he was\r\nmaking him, and he wanted it understood most emphatically that he had\r\nnever been in Mexico six years ago or at any other time and that his\r\nname was John Franks.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Hadley knew he was _not_ mistaken, he knew the man _was_\r\nPearson, and he would not back down or give one hair’s breadth, and\r\nunder his steady, stern gaze Pearson suddenly threw up the game with\r\na vehement burst of profanity, winding up with the inquiry as to what\r\nearthly difference it made to Hadley about the launch, anyhow?\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley stared at him a moment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “WHAT DID YOU DO WITH MY CHILDREN?”]\r\n\r\n“Launch!” he said slowly,--“launch! What do you suppose I care about\r\nthe launch? What I want to know is, what did you do with my children?”\r\n\r\nIt was now Pearson’s turn to stare. His jaw dropped, and his face\r\nturned ashy.\r\n\r\n“Your children? What do you mean? Didn’t they find Miss Marian and the\r\nkids all right?”\r\n\r\n“Find them! Where? Where did you leave them? They’ve never been seen\r\nfrom that day to this. Speak up! What did you do with them?”\r\n\r\nPearson crumpled down into a chair. There was no more resistance in him.\r\n\r\n“Good Heavens! Hadley, I never dreamed of any harm coming to them. I’ll\r\ntell you all I know about it.”\r\n\r\nAnd tell it he did, holding nothing back. He told it all,--how\r\nCunningham had discharged him for no fault of his, so he declared, and\r\nhow he had vowed that he would get even with the dude; he wouldn’t\r\ntake dirty treatment from no man. He had nothing against the girl and\r\nthe kids; he wouldn’t have hurt them, but he didn’t suppose it would.\r\nPeople were going out to those picnics every day, and they often camped\r\novernight, and when he saw what a daisy the launch was,--she ran like\r\noil,--it just came to him that he could leave them there on the Island\r\nand run the launch over to Santa Anita, where he knew a couple of\r\nfellows who would take it off his hands.\r\n\r\nSo he did it; he was owing the fellow at Santa Anita about seventy-five\r\ndollars that he would have paid long before if Cunningham had not fired\r\nhim; and he got there before the storm got really bad and hunted up his\r\nfriend that night and found he would be glad to take the launch on the\r\ndebt and pay him the difference.\r\n\r\nThe storm was sure a bad one, but he had thought that Miss Marian and\r\nthe kids would be all right, for the boy had been telling about a house\r\non the Island around on the sheltered side and a cave, too, and he\r\nleft them all the food and blankets, and he thought Cunningham would\r\nbe after them the first thing in the morning. He’d left Santa Anita as\r\nsoon as the storm was over so anybody could leave, and, of course, he\r\nhad not heard anything about the tragedy at the Port, but he’d swear by\r\neverything holy that he never dreamed of any harm coming to them.\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley explained then; he told the man huddled up before him of\r\nthe search that had been made, and how he himself had just in the last\r\nweek learned what and where Smugglers’ Island was, and how he was even\r\nthen on his way to see if after all these years there was some trace\r\nstill to be found in San Moros.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished, Pearson straightened up a little.\r\n\r\n“Look a-here, Hadley,” he said, “I’ve been some tough, but I’d never\r\n’a’ done a thing like that if I’d ’a’ known it, and since then I’ve\r\nbeen straight. I told you the truth when I said my name was Franks;\r\nthat is my name; I used Pearson at the Port for other reasons, but when\r\nI got back to God’s country I went back to my own name. I was married\r\nunder it about a year later. My wife is a fine woman, and we’ve got two\r\nfine children. I’ve been as straight as a string and we’ve got some\r\nahead. O Hadley, don’t put me through for this!--it will come harder on\r\nmy wife and the kids than it will on me if you do,--and I’ll go down\r\nwith you and help you hunt, show you the way and all; and you can use\r\nmy money to the last cent; it ain’t much, but it’s all yourn to carry\r\non the search; and I’ll stand by you and help you as long as there’s\r\nlife in me, for, as God is my witness, Hadley, I never meant no harm\r\nto Miss Marian and your kids. I wouldn’t ask it if’t wasn’t for my own\r\nkids.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley was thinking. He believed the man was telling the truth, and\r\nno punishment meted out to him would bring back the dead. As far as\r\nthat went, what punishment would be fitter than to take him back with\r\nhim and let him see, if, indeed, there was anything left to see, the\r\nterrible suffering his act had caused? And there would be something\r\nleft; not six years nor seven would destroy what five deaths had left\r\non that grim island in San Moros.\r\n\r\nBefore they sailed, Mr. Hadley had time to write to his wife and tell\r\nher of his finding Pearson and of what he had learned from him and of\r\nthe latter’s agony of remorse. After receiving the letter, Mrs. Hadley\r\nsat down and wrote most of its contents to Mrs. Harris, for she knew\r\ntheir old friends would be anxious to hear any news. After hearing that\r\nletter read, Clarence declared that he could have lived seven years, or\r\ntwice seven years on Smugglers’, and he dared bet Marian could. But\r\nhis father and mother were quite sure there was no hope of that.\r\n\r\n“Why,” said Mrs. Harris, “Jennie would not have lived three days after\r\nexposure to that storm. I never knew such a delicate child.”\r\n\r\n“And,” Mr. Harris declared, “if they had lived any length of time at\r\nall, some one would have seen some sign of them in all this time.\r\nProbably they took refuge in that cave and were washed out and drowned\r\nthe first night.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” he admitted. “I’d forgotten about Jennie being so sickly,\r\nand Delbert himself was not what you would call rugged, but if they\r\nlived through the storm there’s a chance, I tell you. Their not being\r\nseen since doesn’t cut any figure. There was a reason for that. I never\r\ntold Delbert, for I didn’t want to frighten him, and he was a nervous\r\nlittle chap, but no Indian ever went to Smugglers’. You couldn’t have\r\nhired one to, and I tell you, if they lived through the first night,\r\nthere’s a chance! and oh, glory! _wouldn’t_ I have liked to go along?”\r\n\r\nThe steamer that Mr. Hadley and Pearson had taken passage on was pretty\r\nwell filled up with passengers. Among others there was a group of\r\nmining men going to the Port, whence they would make their way inland,\r\nand there was a wealthy Mexican family also bound for the Port, with a\r\nhalf-dozen fine-looking daughters who reminded you of all the Spanish\r\nromance you had ever read every time you looked at them.\r\n\r\nThere were various others, and among them all Mr. Hadley and Pearson\r\nattracted no particular attention until the morning they were nearing\r\nthe Port, when it was learned that Mr. Franks and the white-haired\r\ngentleman with him had a launch aboard and were going to be set down in\r\nit out in the Gulf and were not going into the Port at all. It seemed\r\nthat the captain had known about it all the time, but to the passengers\r\nit seemed like a very queer thing to do.\r\n\r\nHowever, some one made the announcement that the two were going to\r\nexamine some guano caves for a rich company, and that seemed to explain\r\neverything, and the passengers watched with interest while the launch\r\nwas being made ready and lowered, and the mining men all hung over the\r\nrail and cheered as she shot off across the water, and the pretty\r\nseñoritas waved their handkerchiefs, and then everybody turned his\r\nattention to watching the channel, for if the passengers did not keep a\r\nsharp lookout, what was to hinder the captain from forgetting himself\r\nand coming up sharp on the rocks?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRETTY SEÑORITAS WAVED THEIR HANDKERCHIEFS]\r\n\r\nThey passed the Rosalie Group before long. On dark and cloudy nights\r\npeople on boats passing there can hear children crying, and if the\r\nnight is actually stormy, you are likely to see Marian Hadley walk\r\nacross the white-capped waves wrapped in a long cloak. This is a solemn\r\nfact. The captain told it himself. He said he did not tell the tale at\r\nnight. No one connected the name of Hadley with the white-haired Mr.\r\nHadley who had left them in the launch.\r\n\r\nPearson was running the launch. Mr. Hadley had Clarence’s map spread\r\nout on his knee. There was silence between them. Pearson’s face looked\r\ndrawn and old. Mr. Hadley was tired and patient; he was looking at the\r\nmap, but he was not thinking of it.\r\n\r\nPearson leaned forward to look at the little map.\r\n\r\n“I don’t remember just what the shore-line looked like along here,” he\r\nsaid, “but I guess I shan’t miss San Moros.”\r\n\r\nHe did not, either. About noon he turned into the place, remembering\r\nDelbert’s instructions which tallied with the map correctly. The tide\r\nwas high just then, anyway, and there was no danger of sandbars or\r\nsunken rocks. In a little more he could point out to Mr. Hadley the\r\noutline of Smugglers’ Island as he remembered it.\r\n\r\nAfterwards, as they got pretty close to it, he said in a low voice,\r\n“Maybe we’d better go in back of it. That’s where they said the harbor\r\nand the pier were, and it will be a better place to moor the launch\r\nthan this pile of rocks ahead.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley assented; so they turned her nose and ran out by the sandy\r\npoint and round it in back into the harbor.\r\n\r\nIt seemed shadowy in there. It was dark and uncanny, Pearson thought.\r\nHe shuddered. Not a sign of life had they seen other than the seabirds,\r\nfor the old canoe was too far up the beach to catch the eye, and the\r\nwickiup was so covered with vines that it blended perfectly with its\r\nbackground, especially as the doors and window were shut.\r\n\r\nHad they landed, they would have seen the path. Had Marian’s\r\nwatermelons been a little higher, they would have attracted attention\r\nby reason of their regular rows, but they were scarcely above the holes\r\nyet. At the pier, too, there was nothing to tell them anything. The\r\nraft was farther along, back of some mango bushes.\r\n\r\nThere were the bananas and the palms. The corral fence was so\r\novergrown that, like the wickiup, it attracted no attention till one\r\nwas very close to it.\r\n\r\nThey stepped out of the launch and moored her to the pier. Mr. Hadley\r\nnoticed that Pearson’s face was gray again. He was losing his nerve.\r\nIt seemed to him as if the air in this narrow slit in the hills were\r\nsuffocating him.\r\n\r\n“I’ll take the things out,” he said to his companion.\r\n\r\n“All right,” said Mr. Hadley. His voice was quiet and even, and,\r\nturning, he walked toward the hill.\r\n\r\nPearson stepped back into the launch, cursing himself under his breath\r\nfor his own lack of self-control, for he was trembling; but taking the\r\nthings out and carrying them up past the pier steadied him a little.\r\n\r\nThen he started to follow Mr. Hadley, and was glancing about wondering\r\nif there was any particular choice of spots to pitch camp in, when\r\nsomething on the hilltop caught his eyes. He stopped and stared with\r\nhis mouth open. Out from among the bushes into an open space came\r\none, two, three, four, five persons, and some of them were children!\r\nA sudden weakness came over him. He dropped where he was, and for a\r\nmoment everything went whirling black. When he came to himself he was\r\nsitting on the ground, his knees clasped in his arms, as he rocked back\r\nand forth, repeating over and over his wife’s name, “Rose, Rose, Rose,\r\nit’s them! O Rose, it’s them! I ain’t killed ’em, Rose! Rose!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUDDENLY CAME A CHORUS OF CLEAR YOUNG VOICES]\r\n\r\nMr. Hadley had scanned the hillside to no avail as he started to walk\r\ntoward it, and then he noticed what seemed to be a path leading to a\r\nmass of brilliant bloom beyond. He followed in the path. The tracks\r\nseemed to be those of deer.\r\n\r\nBut when he came to the blossoms he was surprised. There were\r\nnasturtiums and poppies, a wild riot of them beside a little spring,\r\nor shallow, scooped-out well, that was walled with rocks except at one\r\nplace where stepping-stones led down. And there, sitting half buried in\r\nthe clear water, shaded by overhanging bloom, was a two-quart Mason jar\r\nabout half full of oysters.\r\n\r\nA most charming refrigerator truly, and Mr. Hadley stared at it\r\nstupidly, not even yet understanding, when suddenly came a chorus\r\nof clear young voices calling to him from above, and, turning, the\r\nfather saw what he had never hoped to see again this side the gates of\r\nheaven,--his five children racing down the hill to meet him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE PICNIC\r\n\r\n\r\nPearson sat on the pier, swinging his feet. His feelings would have\r\nbeen hard to describe, they were so very mixed up. One moment he was\r\nswearing softly at the launch that was dipping gracefully up and down\r\nbefore him, then he grinned and whistled, also softly, a few bars of a\r\nrollicking tune.\r\n\r\nHe glanced out of the corner of his eye at the group up there by that\r\ntumbled pile of red and yellow and green. He could hear their voices,\r\nbut he could not hear what they were saying. By and by, when they had\r\nhad a little more time, perhaps he would go up there, though what in\r\nthunder he would say was more than he knew. Anyway, they were alive.\r\nThat was something to tell Rose. Rose! How her face had looked when\r\nshe bade him good-bye. She had known that he had been tough,--thank\r\ngoodness he had not lied to her!--but he had not gone into details,\r\nand when he had had to tell her about that affair at the Port,--well,\r\nit was a darned sight worse than anything else he had had to do. And\r\nwhen she kissed him good-bye, she had whispered that she would pray for\r\nhim. Pray! Pearson laughed a little and kicked at the rocks. Wa’n’t\r\nthat just like a woman? Pray! What good was it going to do to pray\r\nnow about a thing that happened seven years ago? But she would pray\r\nall right, and like as not she would always feel that her prayers had\r\nhad something to do with their finding the lost ones alive and safe.\r\nSuppose they had died! What good would praying have done then? he\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\nBut Rose would pray just the same, and when he got back to her,--he\r\nmight have to ride a brake-beam to do it,--she would turn in and work\r\nher fingers to the bone to help him get another nest-egg rolled up, and\r\nnever a word of blame would she say. No; she would spend all her spare\r\nbreath thanking God that her prayers had been answered.\r\n\r\nWhat a queer thing life was, anyway! Here, seven years ago Cunningham\r\nhad served him, Pearson, low-down mean, and he had retaliated. The\r\naffair was between him and Cunningham, wasn’t it? It would seem so; but\r\nlook you, seven years afterwards the blow he dealt recoils on--whom?\r\nHimself? No, not by a jugful! On Rose; on Rose and his youngsters,\r\nthe very people of the whole wide world that he loved and wanted most\r\ndesperately to protect. If it had only been him, he wouldn’t say a\r\nword, but--darn it all!\r\n\r\nWell, there they were coming down. He rose and turned. It was an\r\nawkward situation. Really, it would have been easier to stand up to be\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nIt was Marian and Delbert. Pearson drew a long breath, and, throwing\r\nback his shoulders, went to meet them.\r\n\r\nMarian was first. She held out her hand, all brown and calloused, and\r\nher eyes shone at him from under wet lashes.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Pearson,” she said, “papa has explained it all to us, and--well, I\r\nguess I am too happy to lay up anything against you to-day.”\r\n\r\nPearson took her hand. He choked a little, but found nothing to say.\r\nThen Delbert, the little, slender, nervous, eager lad, stood there,\r\ntall as his sister, straight and strong, and his clear eyes were steady\r\nand stern.\r\n\r\n“Marion is of a pretty forgiving disposition,” and his voice was cold\r\nand held scorn. “I think myself--”\r\n\r\nBut Pearson reached out and gripped the hand the boy had not offered\r\nhim, and found his voice.\r\n\r\n“Young man,” he said, “I am so all-fired glad to see you that I don’t\r\ncare a red cent _what_ you think!”\r\n\r\nMarian laid a gentle hand on her brother’s arm.\r\n\r\n“O Delbert,” she said softly, “not to-day, dear, not with papa here to\r\ntake us all back safe to mamma. Besides,--it isn’t a parallel case, I\r\nknow,--but suppose Davie had died that day he fell!”\r\n\r\nDelbert looked from her face, tremulous with joy, back to Pearson’s,\r\nand, remembering that terrible day that he had been in some small\r\nmeasure to blame for, he suddenly understood, understood something of\r\nwhat the man in front of him probably had been suffering.\r\n\r\nHis face softened, and he returned the pressure of the other’s hand.\r\n\r\n“All right!” he said boyishly. “I guess what Marian says goes. You will\r\nhave to fight it out with Mr. Cunningham about the launch, but come on\r\nup to dinner now. Say,” he continued with a wistful eye on the pile of\r\nthings from the launch, “you got anything to eat in those?--any bread\r\nor crackers?”\r\n\r\nUp at the wickiup Mr. Hadley sat on a chunk of driftwood and looked\r\nover the treasures Esther and Davie showed to him, while Marian and\r\nJennie prepared dinner.\r\n\r\nThere was a great deal to show. There were the rabbit-skin books and\r\nthe paper-tree-bark ones and the shell and bone and wooden toys. There\r\nwere the ropes and baskets.\r\n\r\nDavie could not remember his father, but he curled down at his feet\r\nand, with an angelic expression on his face, smiled up into his eyes\r\nin the sunniest way possible. And every two minutes he would remember\r\nsome other treasure and, hopping up, would go to fetch it. His father,\r\nwatching his little limping gait, smiled at Marian, who shook her head\r\nsadly. “Too bad, daughter, but I think mamma will be willing to accept\r\nhim, even if he _is_ a little damaged.”\r\n\r\n“We’ll throw off a little on his price,” said Jennie.\r\n\r\nPearson had brought up the lunch from the launch, and the Hawks fell\r\nupon it with the greatest enthusiasm. After dinner they began to pack\r\nup those things they wished to take with them.\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, before they left the Island they had to show the old\r\ncanoe that would not need to be finished now, and the tar retort, and\r\nHigh-Tide Pool, and the watermelon-patch, and everything else.\r\n\r\n“I’ll bet,” said Delbert, “that this place will be more popular for\r\npicnics from the Port than the Rosalies for a while.”\r\n\r\nSo Marian left her dishes, the kettle and little dishpan, the knives\r\nand forks, and even the glass jar on the table. They put everything in\r\nneat order and tied the window down, and put the storm doors in place\r\nand fastened them, for though they did not expect ever to see the place\r\nagain, they could not bear to think of the dear little wickiup standing\r\nuntidy and open to the elements.\r\n\r\nThey took a last survey from the top of the hill and then went down the\r\npath, the smugglers’ old path, to the pier.\r\n\r\nThey turned out the little burros, but when they called Jackie, he\r\nwas nowhere to be found. He had wandered off somewhere with the\r\nother burros, as he had done sometimes of late. The children, Davie\r\nespecially, felt badly to go without saying good-bye to Jackie, but\r\nMarian explained that he would probably forget them in a little while\r\nand would be perfectly happy with the other burros, and perhaps would\r\nbe happier than if they had stayed and made him carry loads for them\r\nonce in a while. So Davie smoothed out his face, and curled down at his\r\nfather’s feet again, quite contented. Nothing ever upset Davie for any\r\ngreat length of time.\r\n\r\nSo the launch puffed out of the harbor and round the point, and then\r\nSmugglers’ was left behind them, and they were crossing the bay past\r\nthe salt reefs, and now were out of sight of the egg islands, and soon\r\nwere encountering the big waves that had guarded their prison so long.\r\nJennie laughed, remembering how seasick she had been when they came\r\nin. Then San Moros itself passed from their sight, and the life there\r\nglided into a closed past.\r\n\r\nAlready Marian was planning a new and different future.\r\n\r\n“Father,” she said, “you say you had to mortgage the home to get the\r\nmoney to come for us. A mortgage is always a hard thing to lift, isn’t\r\nit?”\r\n\r\n“Apt to be, daughter,” replied Mr. Hadley, “but after seeing what\r\nyou children did with your bare hands back on that Island, I am not\r\nworrying about a little thing like a mortgage. If you don’t like the\r\nplace, we’ll get your uncle to let us in some way on some of that wild\r\nland of his up in the mountains, and you can carve out and build up a\r\nplace to suit yourselves.”\r\n\r\nThe steamer at the Port had unloaded her passengers,--those that were\r\nto get off there,--and had since been busy taking in a nice little\r\npile of cargo. Her captain wished to go out that night, and they were\r\nabout ready to start. There were a good many down on the pier, coming\r\nand going, and the place was lighted by a few lanterns, leaving great\r\nspaces of shadow in between their circles of light.\r\n\r\nMr. Cunningham’s new launch was just in with a picnic party from the\r\nRosalies. They were unloading shawls and baskets and pails of clams.\r\n\r\n“I say, Cunningham,” called out one of this party, “is that Beekman’s\r\ncrowd we passed out there?”\r\n\r\n“No,” was the answer; “Beekman will not be in for two days. I had a\r\nwire to-day.”\r\n\r\n“Well, who in thunder was it, then? We passed a launch out there. If it\r\nwasn’t Beekman, who was it?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps it was the two men the captain dropped in the Gulf this\r\nmorning. He said they would be in in a few days. Perhaps they changed\r\ntheir minds.”\r\n\r\n“Not much. This batch had women and children. They were laughing and\r\nsinging,--mighty fine voices, too. We supposed it was those new cousins\r\nof Mrs. Beekman’s from New York.”\r\n\r\n“No, not they yet, but there comes a launch now. By Jove, there are\r\nwomen in it too.”\r\n\r\nOut of the darkness of the night and the water a launch came swiftly\r\ninto the broad light of the stream. A moment they showed clear as in\r\ndaylight to the crowd on the pier, but that was not long enough for\r\nany one to recognize those upturned faces before they glided into a\r\nshadowy place not far from the other launch.\r\n\r\nPeople watched the new arrival curiously as it discharged its\r\npassengers, but they did not come out of the shadow.\r\n\r\nThen one man detached himself from the group and advanced into the\r\nlight in front of Cunningham.\r\n\r\n“Well, Cunningham,” he said in a clear voice, “there’s your launch.”\r\n\r\nCunningham stared at him.\r\n\r\n“There’s your launch, I say,” repeated the other, thrusting his face\r\nforward a little. Still no answer from the bewildered Cunningham, who\r\ncould not imagine what he was talking about.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer straightened up and placed his arms akimbo.\r\n\r\n“I say,” he repeated again, “that I have brought back your launch.\r\nLaunch, man, launch! There--is--your--launch!”\r\n\r\nFrom the group in the shadow came a little rippling laugh.\r\n\r\nCunningham started. It was nearly seven long years, but he had not\r\nforgotten Marian Hadley’s laugh. He snatched at a lantern, but before\r\nhe could detach it from its hook, a young fellow beside him, a great\r\nstalwart fellow, yelled and began to swing his hat.\r\n\r\n“The Hadleys!” he shouted, “the Hadleys!” and threw the hat into the\r\nair, but before it could fall he was rushing over, calling Delbert.\r\n\r\nMarian, laughing, grasped his arm.\r\n\r\n“For Heaven’s sake, Bobbie,” she said, “take us girls up to your mother\r\nbefore they get here with those lanterns.”\r\n\r\nLate, very late, that night Delbert sat on the edge of Bobbie’s bed and\r\nsaid to him:--\r\n\r\n“Now, look here! what I want to know is, how in creation it could\r\nhappen that, with that bay fairly teeming with fish and turtles, there\r\ncould be over six years with never a canoe really inside of it, never\r\none within hailing, or even signaling, distance of the Island, though\r\nit must be known among the Indians that there is fresh water and an old\r\nbanana-patch there.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HADLEYS! THE HADLEYS!]\r\n\r\n“Simplest thing in the world,” said Bobbie, tossing his shoes to one\r\nside and peeling off his socks. “All the Indians around these parts\r\nknow that San Moros is bad medicine for a native. I never thought\r\nmuch about it, but I’ll bet on it now, that it was those same old\r\nsmugglers. Probably they murdered some Indians there to prevent their\r\ngoing off and telling of the place, or something like that. I never\r\nheard of the Island, but I have heard the Indians say numbers of times\r\nthat people who go in to camp there never come out again. They think\r\nthe farther shores are inhabited by some style of devil or hobgoblin,\r\nand I remember now I have heard them saying that in the last few years\r\nthey have seen devil fires burning there.”\r\n\r\n“Devil fires!” said Delbert helplessly, dropping his hands to his\r\nsides. “Devil fires!”\r\n\r\n“Your camp-fires, of course,” returned Bobbie; “but if those fellows in\r\nthe canoes that you tried to go out and intercept,--if they saw you at\r\nall,--that would be explanation enough of why they put up their sails\r\nand put off as fast as they could.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the mother waiting on that far-off mortgaged farm, a message went\r\nout that night, the last one sent from the office. It contained eight\r\nwords, and it was followed by a fat, fat letter the next day, which\r\nexplained that it in turn was to be followed by a party of six just as\r\nsoon as certain absolutely necessary sewing could be done.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the telegram contained the heart of the matter, the\r\nsunshine of the whole wide world and part of that of the next world,\r\nall on a piece of yellow paper. At least, Mrs. Hadley thought so when\r\nshe tore it open and read:--\r\n\r\n“All found alive and well on Smugglers’ Island.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Riverside Press\r\n  CAMBRIDGE .
