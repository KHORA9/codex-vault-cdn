They were very poor, for\r\nthough Mr. Loring, during his life time was considered rich, and his\r\nwife and child had always lived comfortably, after his death, which\r\noccurred when Guy was about eight years old, they found that there were\r\nso many people to whom Mr. Loring owed money, that when the debts were\r\npaid there was but little left for the widow and her only child. That\r\nwould not have been so bad had they had friends able or willing to\r\nassist them, but Mrs. Loring found that most of her friends had gone\r\nwith her wealth, which, I am sorry to say, is apt to be the case the\r\nworld over.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, when Mrs. Loring became a widow she was both poor and\r\nfriendless, she was also very delicate. She had never worked in her\r\nlife, and although she attempted to do so, in order to support herself\r\nand little Guy, she found it almost impossible to earn enough to supply\r\nthem with food. She opened a little school, but could get only a few\r\nscholars, and they paid her so little that she was obliged also to take\r\nin sewing. This displeased the parents of her pupils and they took away\r\ntheir children, saying \"she could not do two things at once.\"\r\n\r\nThis happened early in winter when they needed money far more than at\r\nany other season. But though Mrs. Loring sewed a great deal during that\r\nlong, dreary winter, she was paid so little that both young Guy and\r\nherself often felt the pangs of cold and hunger. Perhaps they need not\r\nhave done so, if Mrs. Loring had told the village people plainly that\r\nshe was suffering, for I am sure they would have given her food. But\r\nshe was far too proud to beg or to allow her son to do so. She had no\r\nobjection that he should work, for toil is honorable--but in the winter\r\nthere was little a boy of ten could do, and although Guy was very\r\nindustrious it was not often he could obtain employment. So they every\r\nday grew poorer, for although they had no money their clothing and\r\nscanty furniture did not know it, and wore out much quicker than that\r\nof rich people seems to do.\r\n\r\nYet through all the trials of the long winter Mrs. Loring did not\r\ndespair; she had faith to believe that God was bringing her sorrows\r\nupon her for the best, and would remove them in his own good time.\r\nThis, she would often say to Guy when she saw him look sad, and he\r\nwould glance up brightly with the reply, \"I am sure it is for the best,\r\nmother. You have always been so good I am sure God will not let you\r\nsuffer long. I think we shall do very well when the Spring comes. We\r\nshall not need a fire then, or suffer for the want of warm clothing and\r\nI shall be able to go out in the fields to work, and shall earn so much\r\nmoney that you will not have to sew so much, and get that horrid pain\r\nin your chest.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the Spring came Guy did not find it so easy to get work as he\r\nhad fancied it would be, for there were a great many strong, rough boys\r\nthat would do twice as much work in the day as one who had never been\r\nused to work, and the farmers would employ them, of course. So poor Guy\r\ngrew almost disheartened, and his mother with privation and anxiety,\r\nfell very sick.\r\n\r\nAlthough afraid she would die she would not allow Guy to call any of\r\nthe village people in, for she felt that they had treated her very\r\nunkindly and could not bear that they should see how very poor she was.\r\nShe however told Guy he could go for a doctor, and he did so, calling\r\nin one that he had heard often visited the poor and charged them\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nThis good man whose name was Langley, went to Mrs. Loring's, and soon\r\nsaw both how indigent and how ill the poor woman was. He was very\r\nkind and gave her medicines and such food as she could take, although\r\nit hurt her pride most bitterly to accept them. He also gave Guy, some\r\nwork to do, and he was beginning to hope that his mother was getting\r\nwell, and that better days were coming, when going home one evening\r\nfrom his work he found his mother crying most bitterly. He was in great\r\ndistress at this, and begged her to tell him what had happened. At\r\nfirst she refused to do so, but at last said:--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps, Guy, it is best for me to tell you all, for if trouble must\r\ncome, it is best to be prepared for it. Sit here on the bed beside me,\r\nand I will try to tell you:\"\r\n\r\nShe then told him that Doctor Langley had been there that afternoon,\r\nand had told her very gently, but firmly, that she was in a consumption\r\nand would die. \"Unless,\" she added, \"I could leave this part of the\r\ncountry. With an entire change of food and air, he told me that I might\r\nlive many years. But you know, my dear boy, it is impossible for me to\r\nhave that, so I must make up my mind to die. That would not be so hard\r\nto do if it were not for leaving you alone in this uncharitable world.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Mrs. Loring who had been vainly striving to suppress her emotions,\r\nburst into tears, and Guy who was dreadfully shocked and alarmed, cried\r\nwith her. It seemed so dreadful to him that his mother should die when\r\na change of air and freedom from anxiety might save her. He thought of\r\nit very sadly for many days, but could see no way of saving his mother.\r\nHe watched her very closely, and although she seemed to gain a little\r\nstrength as the days grew warmer, and even sat up, and tried to sew,\r\nhe was not deceived into thinking she would get well, for the doctor\r\nhad told him she never would, though for the summer she might appear\r\nquite strong.\r\n\r\nHe was walking slowly and sadly through the street one day, thinking of\r\nthis, when he heard two gentlemen who were walking before him, speak of\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true,\" said one, \"that Harwood is going there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the other, \"he thinks he can better his condition by doing\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know what steamer he will leave on?\" asked the first speaker.\r\n\r\n\"He is not going by steamer,\" replied the second, \"as Aggie is quite\r\ndelicate, he has decided to go across the plains.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! indeed. When do they start?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as possible. Mrs. Harwood told me to-day, that the chief\r\nthing they were waiting for, was a servant. Aggie needs so much of her\r\ncare that she must have a nurse for the baby, and she says it seems\r\nimpossible to induce a suitable person to go. Of course she doesn't\r\nwant a coarse, uneducated servant, but some one she can trust, and who\r\nwill also be a companion for herself during the long journey.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen passed on, and Guy heard no more, but he stood quite\r\nstill in the street, and with a throbbing heart, thought, \"Oh! if my\r\nmother could go across the plains, it would cure her. Oh! if Mrs.\r\nHarwood would but take her as a nurse. I know she is weak, but she\r\ncould take care of a little baby on the plains much better than she can\r\nbend over that hard sewing here, and besides I could help her. Oh! if\r\nMrs. Harwood would only take her. I'll find out where she lives, and\r\nask her to do so.\"\r\n\r\nHe had gained the desired information and was on his way to Mrs.\r\nHarwood's house before he remembered that his mother might not consent\r\nto go if Mrs. Harwood was willing to take her. He knew she was very\r\nproud, and had been a rich lady herself once, and would probably shrink\r\nin horror from becoming a servant. His own pride for a moment revolted\r\nagainst it, but his good sense came to his aid, and told him it was\r\nbetter to be a servant than die. He went on a little farther, and then\r\nquestioned himself whether it would not be better to go first and tell\r\nhis mother about it, and ask her consent to speak to Mrs. Harwood. But\r\nit was a long way back, and as he greatly feared his mother would not\r\nallow him to come, and would probably be much hurt at his suggesting\r\nsuch a thing, he determined to act for once without her knowledge, and\r\nwithout further reflection walked boldly up to Mrs. Harwood's door. It\r\nwas open, and when he knocked some one called to him to come in.\r\n\r\nHe did so, although for a moment he felt inclined to run away. There\r\nwas a lady in the room, and four children--two large boys, a delicate\r\nlooking girl about five years old, and a baby boy who was sitting on\r\nthe floor playing with a kitten, but who stopped and stared at Guy as\r\nhe entered.\r\n\r\nThe other children did the same, and Guy was beginning to feel very\r\ntimid and uncomfortable, when the lady asked who he wished to see.\r\n\r\nHe told her Mrs. Harwood, and the eldest boy said, \"That's ma's name,\r\nisn't it, ma? What do you want of ma? say!\"\r\n\r\nGuy said nothing to the rude boy, but told Mrs. Harwood what he had\r\nheard on the street.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" she said kindly, \"I do want a nurse. Has some one sent\r\nyou here to apply for the place?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, ma'am,\" he replied, \"no one sent me, but--but--I came--of\r\nmyself--because--I thought--my--mother--might--perhaps suit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is a strange thing for a little boy to do!\" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nHarwood.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo, Gus,\" cried the boy that had before spoken, \"here's a friend of\r\nmine; guess he's the original Young America, 'stead of me!\"\r\n\r\n\"George, be silent,\" said his mother, very sternly. \"Now, child,\" she\r\ncontinued, turning again to Guy, \"you may tell me how you ever thought\r\nof doing so strange a thing as applying for a place for your mother,\r\nunless she told you to do so. Is she unkind to you? Do you want her to\r\nleave you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, she is very, very kind,\" said Guy, earnestly, \"and I wouldn't\r\nbe parted from her for the world.\" He then forgot all his fears, and\r\neagerly told the lady how sick his mother had been, and how sure he\r\nwas that the trip across the plains would cure her, and, above all,\r\ntold how good and kind she was; \"she nursed me,\" he concluded, very\r\nearnestly, \"and you see what a big boy I am!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harwood smiled so kindly that he was almost certain she would take\r\nhis mother; but his heart fell, when she said: \"I am very sorry that\r\nyour mother is sick, but I don't think I can take her with me; and\r\nbesides, Mr. Harwood would not like to have another boy to take care\r\nof.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I will take care of myself,\" cried Guy, \"and help a great deal\r\nabout the wagons. Oh, ma'am, if you would only take me, I would light\r\nthe fires when you stopped to camp, and get water, and do a great many\r\nthings, and my mother would do a great deal too.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harwood shook her head, and poor Guy felt so downcast that he was\r\ngreatly inclined to cry. The boys laughed, but the little girl looked\r\nvery sorry, and said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Don't look so sad; perhaps mamma will yet take your mother, and I will\r\ntake you. I want you to go. You look good and kind, and wouldn't let\r\nGeorge tease me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I wouldn't,\" said Guy, looking pityingly upon the frail little\r\ncreature, and wondering how any one could think of being unkind to her.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked the little one.\r\n\r\n\"Guy,\" he replied, and the boys burst into a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, let us take him with us, ma,\" cried George, \"it would be such\r\ncapital fun to have a 'guy' with us all the time, to make us laugh. Oh,\r\nma, do let him go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, mamma, do let him go,\" said little Aggie, taking her brother's\r\npetition quite in earnest. \"I am sure he could tell me lots of pretty\r\nstories, and you wouldn't have to tell me 'Bluebeard' and 'Cinderella,'\r\nuntil you were tired of telling, and I of hearing them.\"\r\n\r\nNow Mrs. Harwood was very fond of her children, and always liked to\r\nindulge them, if she possibly could, especially her little, delicate\r\nAgnes. She thought to herself, as she saw them together, that he might,\r\nin reality, be very useful during the trip, especially as Agnes had\r\ntaken so great a fancy to him; so she decided, instead of sending him\r\naway, as she had first intended, to keep him a short time, and if he\r\nproved as good a boy as he appeared, to go with him to his mother and\r\nsee what she could do for her. Accordingly, she told Guy to stay with\r\nthe children for an hour, while she thought of the matter. He did so,\r\nand as she watched him closely, she saw, with surprise, that he amused\r\nAgnes by his lively stories, the baby by his antics, and was successful\r\nnot only in preventing Gus and George from quarreling, but in keeping\r\nfriendly with them himself.\r\n\r\n\"This boy is very amiable and intelligent,\" she said to herself, \"and\r\nas he loves her so well, it is likely his mother has the same good\r\nqualities. I will go around to see her, and if she is well enough to\r\ntravel, and is the sort of person I imagine, I will certainly try to\r\ntake her with me.\"\r\n\r\nShe sent Guy home with a promise to that effect, and in great delight\r\nhe rushed into the house, and told his mother what he had done. At\r\nfirst she was quite angry, and Guy felt very wretchedly over his\r\nimpulsive conduct; but when he told her how kind the lady was, and how\r\nlight her duties would probably be, she felt almost as anxious as Guy\r\nhimself, that Mrs. Harwood should find her strong and agreeable enough\r\nto take the place.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Harwood came the next day, and were much pleased with\r\nMrs. Loring, and perhaps more so with Guy, though they did not say so.\r\nThe doctor came in while they were there, and was delighted with the\r\nproject, assuring Mrs. Loring that the trip would greatly benefit her,\r\nand privately telling Mr. and Mrs. Harwood what a good woman she was,\r\nand how willing she was to do any thing honorable for the support of\r\nherself and her little boy. So they decided to take her.\r\n\r\n\"We will give you ten dollars a month,\" said they, \"so you will not be\r\nquite penniless when you get to California.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Loring thanked them most heartily, and Guy felt as if all the\r\nriches of the world had been showered down upon them.\r\n\r\n\"You look like an energetic little fellow,\" said Mr. Harwood to Guy,\r\nas they were going away, \"and I hope you will continue to be one, else\r\nI shall leave you on the plains. Remember, I'll have no laggards in my\r\ntrain.\"\r\n\r\nGuy promised most earnestly to be as alert and industrious as could be\r\ndesired, and full of good intentions and delightful hopes, went back\r\nto his mother to talk of what might happen during their TRIP ACROSS THE\r\nPLAINS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow quickly the next two weeks of Guy Loring's life flew by. He was\r\nbusy and therefore had no time to notice how often his mother sighed\r\ndeeply when he talked of the free, joyous life they should lead on the\r\nplains. There seemed to her little prospect of freedom or pleasure in\r\nbecoming a servant; yet she said but little about it to Guy as she\r\ndid not wish to dampen the ardor of his feelings, fearing that the\r\nstern reality of an emigrant's life would soon throw a cloud over his\r\nblissful hopes. Even Guy himself sometimes felt half inclined to repent\r\nhis impulsiveness, for George Harwood constantly reminded him of it by\r\ncalling him \"Young America\" and asking him if he had no other servants\r\nto hire out.\r\n\r\nGuy bore all these taunts very quietly, and even laughed at them, and\r\nmade himself so useful and agreeable to every one, that on the morning\r\nof the start from W----, Mr. Harwood was heard to say he would as soon\r\nbe without one of his best men as little Guy Loring.\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful morning in May, 1855, upon which Mr. Harwood's train\r\nleft W----. Guy was amazed at the number of people, of horses and\r\nwagons, and at the preparations that had been made for the journey.\r\nBesides Mr. Harwood's family there was that of his cousin, Mr. Frazer;\r\nfive young men from St. Louis, and another with his two sisters from\r\nW----. Guy could not but wonder that so many people should travel\r\ntogether, for he thought it would have been much pleasanter for each\r\nfamily to be alone, until he heard that there were a great many\r\nIndians upon the plains who often robbed, and sometimes murdered small\r\nparties of travelers.\r\n\r\nAs the long train of wagons and cattle moved along the narrow streets\r\nof the quiet village, Guy thought of all he had read of the caravans\r\nthat used to cross the desert sands of Arabia. \"Doesn't it remind you\r\nof them:\" he said, after mentioning his thoughts to George Harwood who\r\nwas standing near.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit\" he replied with a laugh. \"Those great, strong, covered\r\nwagons don't look much like the queer old caravans did I guess, and\r\nneither the mules or oxen are like camels, besides the drivers haven't\r\nany turbans on their heads, and the people altogether look much more\r\nlike Christians than Arabs.\"\r\n\r\nGuy was quite abashed, and not daring to make any other comparisons,\r\nasked Gus to tell him the name of the owner of each wagon as it passed.\r\n\r\n\"The first was father's,\" he answered readily, \"the next two cousin\r\nJames Frazer's. The next one belongs to William Graham, and his two\r\nsisters, the next two to the young men from St. Louis, and the other\r\nsix are baggage wagons.\"\r\n\r\nGuy could ask nothing more as Mr. Harwood called to him to help them\r\nin driving some unruly oxen that were in the rear of the train. Next\r\nhe was ordered to run back to the village for some article that had\r\nbeen forgotten, next to carry water to the teamsters, then to run\r\nwith messages from one person to another until he was so tired, he\r\nthoroughly envied George and Gus their comfortable seats in one of the\r\nbaggage wagons, and was delighted at last to hear the signal to halt.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had been traveling all day they were but a few miles\r\nfrom the village, and the people in spite of the wearisome labors of\r\nthe day scarcely realized that they had begun a long and perilous\r\njourney. To most of them it seemed like a picnic party, but to poor\r\nlittle Guy, it seemed a very tiresome one as he assisted in taking a\r\nsmall cooking-stove from Mr. Harwood's baggage wagon. As soon as it was\r\nset up, in the open air, at a short distance from the wagons, he was\r\nordered to make a fire. There was a quantity of dry wood at hand, and\r\nsoon he had the satisfaction of seeing a cheerful blaze. Asking Gus to\r\ntake care that it did not go out, he took a kettle from the wagon and\r\nwent to the spring for water.\r\n\r\nEvery person was too busy to notice whether Gus watched the fire or\r\nnot. Some were building fires for themselves, some unhitching the\r\nhorses from the traces, unyoking the oxen, and giving them water and\r\nfeed. Guy thought he had never beheld so busy a scene as he came back\r\nwith the water, hoping that his fire was burning brightly. Alas! not\r\na spark was to be seen, Gus had gone with George to see the cows\r\nmilked, and poor Guy had to build the fire over again. Although he was\r\nvery tired he would have gone to work cheerfully enough, had not Mrs.\r\nHarwood, who was wishing to warm some milk for the baby reprimanded him\r\nseverely for his negligence. He thought the fire would never burn, and\r\nwas almost ready to cry with vexation and fatigue. Indeed two great\r\ntears did gather in his eyes, and roll slowly over his cheeks. He tried\r\nto wipe them away, but was not quick enough to prevent George Harwood\r\nwho had returned from milking, from seeing them.\r\n\r\n\"Hullo!\" he cried, catching Guy by the ears and holding back his\r\nhead that everybody might see his face, \"here is 'Young America'\r\nboo-hoo-ing, making a reg'lar 'guy' of himself sure enough. Has\r\nsomebody stepped on his poor 'ittle toe?\" he added with mock\r\ntenderness, as if he was talking to a little child; \"never mind, hold\r\nup your head, or you'll put the fire out with your tears; just see how\r\nthey make it fizzle: why, how salt they must be!\"\r\n\r\nGuy had the good sense neither to get angry, or to cry, at this\r\nraillery, although he found it hard to abstain from doing both. But he\r\nremembered in time that his mother had told him the only way to silence\r\nGeorge was to take no notice of him.\r\n\r\n\"Guy,\" said Mrs. Harwood, who had just come from the wagon, with some\r\nmeat to be cooked for supper, \"I want you to go to your mother, and\r\namuse Aggie.\"\r\n\r\nHe went joyfully as he had not seen his mother since morning. He\r\nuttered an exclamation of surprise when he entered the wagon in which\r\nshe was seated, it was so different from what he had imagined it. It\r\nwas covered with thick oil-cloth, which was quite impervious to rain;\r\non the floor was a carpet, over head a curious sort of rack that held\r\nall manner of useful things, guns, fishing poles and lines, game bags,\r\nbaskets of fruit, sewing materials, books; and even glass-ware and\r\ncrockery. Guy thought he had never seen so many things packed in so\r\nsmall a space. There were at the rear of the wagon and along the sides,\r\ndivans, or cushioned benches, made of pine boxes covered with cloth and\r\npadded, so that they made very comfortable seats or beds. As Guy saw no\r\nsheets or blankets upon the divans, he was at a loss to know how the\r\nsleepers would keep warm, until his mother raised the cushioned lid of\r\none of the boxes, and showed him a quantity of coverlets and blankets,\r\npacked tightly therein.\r\n\r\nThere was a large, round lamp suspended from the center of the wagon,\r\nand as Guy looked at his mother's cheerful surroundings he could not\r\nbut wonder that she sighed when he spoke of the dark, lonesome lodgings\r\nthey had left, until he suddenly remembered that she had been nursing\r\nthe heavy, fretful baby, and trying to amuse Aggie all the day.\r\n\r\nPoor little Aggie was looking very sad, and often said she was very\r\ntired of the dull wagon, and was cold, too. Guy told her of the bright\r\ncamp-fires that were burning beside the wagons, and asked her to go out\r\nwith him to see them, for although he was very tired and would gladly\r\nhave rested in the wagon, he was willing to weary himself much more if\r\nhe could do anything to please the sickly little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh I should like to go very much,\" cried Aggie eagerly, \"Go and ask\r\nma if I can! It will be such fun to see the fires burning and all the\r\npeople standing around them.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Harwood was willing for Guy to take Aggie out, if he would be\r\ncareful of her, and so he went back and told the anxious little girl.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! but I am afraid you won't take care of me,\" she exclaimed hastily.\r\n\"No body but mamma takes care of me. George and Gus always lets me\r\nfall, and then I cry because I am hurt, and then papa whips them, and I\r\ncry harder than ever because _they_ are hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we will have no hurting or crying this time,\" replied Guy as he\r\nhelped Aggie out of the wagon, thinking what a tenderhearted girl\r\nshe must be to cry to see George Harwood whipped, he was sure that he\r\nshould not, \"for,\" said Guy to himself, \"we should never cry over what\r\nwe think will do people good.\"\r\n\r\nHow busy all the people seemed to be as Guy, with Aggie by his side\r\nwalked among them. Both were greatly pleased at the novel scene\r\npresented to their view. Two cooking stoves were sending up from their\r\nblack pipes thick spirals of smoke, while half a dozen clouds of the\r\nsame arose from as many fires, around which were gathered men and women\r\nbusily engaged in preparing the evening meal. Tea and coffee were\r\nsteaming, beefsteaks broiling, slices of bacon sputtering in the frying\r\npans, each and every article sending forth most appetizing odors.\r\n\r\nAggie was anxious to see how her father's baggage wagons were arranged\r\nand where they stood. They proved to be the very best of the train, but\r\nthey were so interested in all they saw and heard that they did not\r\nappear long in reaching them.\r\n\r\n\"What a nice time we shall have on the Plains,\" exclaimed Aggie. \"I\r\nshall want you to take me out among the wagons every night. I never\r\nthought such great, lumbering things could look so pretty. I thought\r\nthe cloth coverings so coarse and yellow this morning, and now by the\r\nblaze of the fires they appear like banks of snow.\"\r\n\r\nSo she talked on until Guy had led her past the fires, the groups were\r\nbusy and cheerful people, the lowing cattle and the tired horses and\r\nmules which were quietly munching their fodder and corn, until they\r\nreached the baggage wagons. In one of them they found a lamp burning,\r\nand by its light they saw how closely it was packed. There were\r\nbarrels of beef, pork, sugar, flour, and many other articles which were\r\nrequisite for a long journey. There were boxes too, of tea, coffee,\r\nrice, crackers and many other edibles, and in one corner, quite apart\r\nfrom these a number of flasks of powder. There were also several guns,\r\nsome spades and other tools, and a great many things which Guy and\r\nAggie thought useless, but proved very valuable at a later time.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what papa brought so many guns for?\" said little Aggie. \"And\r\nall the others have them too. I should think they would be afraid to\r\nsleep in a wagon with so many guns and so much powder in it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Men should not be afraid of anything,\" said Guy very bravely, \"and at\r\nany rate not of guns and powder, for with them they can guard their\r\nlives and property from the Indians.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Indians!\" cried Aggie opening her eyes very wide with fright and\r\nsurprise. \"Are there Indians on the Plains?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But don't be frightened,\" replied Guy. \"They shall not harm you,\r\nand perhaps we may not see any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I hope we shan't. Let us go back to mother, it is getting dark,\r\nand I'm so frightened. Oh, dear! Oh, dear!\"\r\n\r\nAggie's alarm rather amused Guy, but he soothed her very kindly and\r\ntold her he would take her to her mother, and they had just left\r\nthe wagon, when a terrible figure, wrapped in a buffalo robe, and\r\nbrandishing in his hand a small hatchet, jumped with an awful yell into\r\nthe path before them.\r\n\r\nPoor Aggie caught Guy's arm and screaming with terror begged him to\r\nsave her from the Indian. For a moment Guy himself was startled, then\r\nas the monster came nearer he jumped forward, wrested the hatchet from\r\nits grasp, and with hands neither slow nor gentle, tore the buffalo\r\nrobe aside and administered some hearty cuffs to the crest-fallen\r\nGeorge Harwood.\r\n\r\n\"Let me go,\" he said piteously. \"Don't you see who I am? I'll tell my\r\nfather, so I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a fine Indian,\" said Guy, contemptuously, \"just able to\r\nfrighten little girls.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can whip you,\" exclaimed George, as he saw Guy was preparing to lead\r\nAggie to her mother. \"Just come on!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Guy, who had already proved the cowardice of his opponent,\r\n\"I am quite willing always to protect my master's daughter from\r\nIndians, but not to fight his sons.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravely spoken my little man,\" exclaimed Mr. Harwood, who had\r\napproached them unperceived.\r\n\r\n\"He's a coward,\" whimpered George, \"he struck me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw all that passed,\" replied Mr. Harwood, \"and I wonder that he\r\nacted so well. I shall make him from henceforth Aggie's especial\r\ndefender, and he can strike whoever molests her, whether it be an\r\nIndian or any one else.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge walked sullenly away, and Mr. Harwood, Aggie and Guy turned\r\ntoward the camp-fires, and passing three or four, reached that of their\r\nown party. At some little distance from it was spread a tablecloth\r\ncovered with plates, dishes of bread, vegetables and meat, cups of\r\nsteaming coffee, and other articles. On the grass around this lowly\r\ntable the family were seated, all cheerful and all by the labors of\r\nthe day blessed with an appetite that rendered their first meal in camp\r\nperfectly delicious.\r\n\r\nBut for Guy, a dreary hour followed the supper, there were dishes to\r\nwash, water to fetch, and fires to pile high with wood. Guy almost\r\nenvied his mother the task of rocking the baby to sleep, yet was glad\r\nthat he was able to do the harder work which would otherwise have\r\nfallen on her hands.\r\n\r\nIt was quite late when all his work was done, and he was able to sit\r\nfor a few moments by the camp-fire. He had just begun to tell Aggie of\r\n\"Jack, the Giant Killer's\" wonderful exploits, when Mr. Harwood rang a\r\nlarge bell, and all the people left their fires and congregated about\r\nhis. Mr. Harwood then stood up with a book in his hand and told them in\r\na few words what a long and perilous journey they had undertaken, and\r\nasked them to join with him in entreating God's blessing upon them. He\r\nthen read a short chapter from the bible and all knelt down while he\r\noffered up a prayer for guidance and protection.\r\n\r\nAggie whispered to Guy, as she bade him \"good-night,\" that after\r\nthat prayer she should not be afraid of the Indians, and went very\r\ncontentedly to her mother's wagon, while Guy followed Gus and George to\r\nthe one in which they were to sleep.\r\n\r\nThey were all too weary to talk, and wrapping their blankets around\r\nthem lay down, and Gus and George were soon fast asleep. Guy lay awake\r\nsome time, looking out at the bright fires--the sleeping cattle, the\r\nlong row of wagons, seeing in fancy far beyond the wide expanse of\r\nprairies, the snowy peaks of the Rocky Mountains, and at last in his\r\npeaceful sleep, the golden land of California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Guy but a few short moments before he was aroused from\r\nsleep by the voice of Mr. Harwood, calling to him to light the fire in\r\nthe stove.\r\n\r\nHe started up, for a moment, thinking himself in the poor lodging\r\nat W----, and wondering why his mother had called him so early. But\r\nthe sight of the closely packed wagon, and his sleeping companions,\r\nimmediately recalled to his remembrance his new position and its many\r\nduties. He hurriedly left the wagon, but as it was still quite dark\r\nto his sleepy eyes, he had to wait a few moments and look cautiously\r\naround, before he could decide which way to turn his steps.\r\n\r\nThe first objects he saw, were the camp-fires, which were smouldering\r\nslowly away as if the gray dawn that was peeping over the hills was\r\nputting them to shame. He thought to himself \"I am the first up,\" but\r\non going forward a few steps, found himself mistaken, several of the\r\nmen were moving briskly about, rousing the lazy horses and oxen, or\r\nbuilding fires.\r\n\r\n\"I shall have to be quick,\" thought Guy, \"or I shall be the last\r\ninstead of the first!\" and he went to work with such ardor that he had\r\na fire in the stove, and the kettle boiling over it before any one came\r\nto cook breakfast.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to see that his mother was the first to leave Mr. Harwood's\r\nwagon, for he wanted to have a chat with her alone, but his pleasure\r\nwas soon turned to sorrow when he saw how weary she looked. He feared,\r\nat first, that she was ill, but she told him that the baby had passed\r\na restless night and kept her awake. Poor Mrs. Loring could not take\r\nup her new life as readily as Guy, and even while she encouraged him\r\nalways to look upon the bright side, she very often saw only the dark\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nBut no one could long remain dull or unhappy that beautiful spring\r\nmorning. The dawn grew brighter as the fires died away, and at last the\r\nsun extinguished them altogether by the glory of his presence, as he\r\nrose above the distant hills.\r\n\r\nGuy thought he had never beheld so lovely a scene. There was the busy,\r\nnoisy camp before him, and beyond it the calm beauty of freshly budding\r\nforests, standing forth in bold relief from the blue sky which bore on\r\nits bosom the golden sphere whence emanate all light and heat, God's\r\ngifts that make our earth so lovely and so fruitful.\r\n\r\nThose were Guy's thoughts as he moved about, willingly assisting his\r\nmother, and the two young girls who, with their brother had left W----\r\nto seek their fortunes in the far West. Guy pitied them very much for\r\nthey were unused to work and had at that time a great deal to do. So\r\nwhen he went to the spring for water, he brought also a pailful for\r\nthem, and when he had a leisure moment, he did any little chores for\r\nthem that he could. He had not noticed them much the night before, but\r\nthat morning he became quite well acquainted with them; discovered that\r\nthe elder was called Amy, and the younger Carrie, and that they were\r\nboth very pleasant, and appreciative of all little acts of kindness.\r\n\r\nBefore the sun was an hour high, the breakfast had been partaked of,\r\nthe camp furniture replaced in the wagons and the train put in motion.\r\n\r\nSlowly and steadily the well-trained mules and the patient oxen wended\r\ntheir way towards the Missouri River, and so for nearly two weeks the\r\nmarch was kept up with no incident occurring to break its monotony,\r\nsave the daily excitement of breaking camp at noon and after a tiresome\r\nwalk of a dozen miles or more, building the watch fires at night, and\r\ntalking over the events of the day.\r\n\r\nI think had it not been for Aggie, Guy would often have fallen to sleep\r\nas soon as he joined the circle round the fire, for he was generally\r\ngreatly wearied by the labors of the day. Every one found something for\r\nGuy to do, and as he never shirked his work as many boys do, be found\r\nbut little time for rest, and none for play.\r\n\r\nSo, as I have said, he was usually so tired at night that he would\r\ncertainly have fallen asleep as soon as he gained a quiet nook by\r\nthe fire, but for little Aggie, who never failed to take a seat close\r\nbeside him and ask for a story. So with the little girl on one side,\r\nGus on the other, and George seated where he could hear without\r\nappearing to listen, Guy would tell them all the wonderful tales he had\r\never read, and many beside that were never printed or even known before.\r\n\r\nThose hours spent around the glowing fires, were happy ones to the\r\nchildren. Even George, when he looked up at the countless stars looking\r\ndown upon them from the vast expanse of heaven, was quieted and seldom\r\nannoyed either Guy or his eager listeners by his ill-timed jests or\r\npractical jokes.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" said little Aggie one evening, when she was sitting by the\r\nfire with her curly head resting on Guy's arms, \"that you would tell me\r\nwhere all the pretty sparks go when they fly upward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, they die and fall to the earth again,\" exclaimed George, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think they do,\" replied Aggie, \"I think the fire-flies catch\r\nthem and carry them away under their wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"And hang them for lamps in butterflies' houses,\" suggested Guy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" cried Aggie, clapping her hand in delight. \"Do tell us about\r\nthem, Guy! I am sure you can!\"\r\n\r\nSo Guy told her about the wonderful bowers in the centre of large\r\nroses where the butterflies rest at night, of the great parlor in the\r\nmiddle of all, whose walls are of the palest rose and whose ceiling is\r\nupheld by pillars of gold, and of the bed chambers on either hand with\r\ntheir crimson hangings and their atmosphere of odors so sweet that the\r\nvery butterflies sometimes become intoxicated with its deliciousness,\r\nand sleep until the rude sun opens their chamber doors and dries the\r\ndew-drops upon their wings. And he told them too, how the butterflies\r\ngave a ball one night. All the rose parlors were opened and at each\r\ndoor two fire-flies stood, each with a glowing spark of flame to light\r\nthe gay revellers to the feast.\r\n\r\nFor a long time they patiently stood watching the dancers, and\r\nrecounting to each other the origin of the tiny lamps they held.\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said one, \"caught the last gleam from a widow's hearth, and left\r\nher and her children to freeze; but I couldn't help that for my Lady\r\nGolden Wing told me to bring the brightest light to-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet you are scarcely seen,\" replied his companion, \"and 'tis right\r\nyour flame should be dull, for the cruelty you showed toward the poor\r\nwidow, I caught my light from a rich man's fire and injured no one, and\r\nthat is how my lamp burns brighter than yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"At any rate I have the comfort of knowing mine is as bright as that of\r\nsome others here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay even mine is brighter than yours,\" cried a fly from a neighboring\r\nrose. \"I would scorn to get my light as you did yours. I caught mine\r\nfrom the tip of a match with which a little servant-maid was lighting\r\na fire for her sick mistress. It was the last match in the house too,\r\nand it made me laugh till I ached to hear how mistress and maid groaned\r\nover my fun.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot say much of my cruelty when you think of your own,\"\r\ncommented the first, \"nor need you wonder that your lamp is dull. But\r\nlook at the light at my Lord Spangle Down's door, it is the most\r\nglorious of them all, and held by poor little Jetty Back! Jetty Back!\r\nJetty Back, where did you light your lamp to-night?\"\r\n\r\n\"I took the spark from a shingle roof, beneath which lay four little\r\nchildren asleep,\" she modestly answered. \"It was a fierce, red spark,\r\nas you still may see, and it threatened to burn the dry roof and the\r\nold walls, and the children too. So I caught it up and bore it away,\r\nand the children sleep in safety while I shine gloriously here.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" concluded Guy, \"a good deed will shine, and glow, ages after\r\nevil and cruel ones are forgotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a pretty story,\" said Aggie, contentedly, \"and I am going to\r\nbed now to dream all night of the good fly, and her fadeless lamp.\r\nGood-night, dear Guy, don't forget that pretty story, for you must tell\r\nit again to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut on the morrow neither the story of the fire-flies or any other was\r\ntold, for late in the afternoon they arrived at Fort Leavenworth, which\r\nis situated on the western border of Missouri, and was then the last\r\nwhite settlement that travelers saw for many hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nAll felt very sad the next morning when the train proceeded on its way.\r\nMany of them thought they were leaving civilization and its blessings\r\nforever behind, and as they looked toward the vast prairie of the West\r\nthey remembered with a shudder how many had found a grave beneath its\r\ntall grass. But there was no delaying or turning back then, and so they\r\nslowly continued their way, pausing but once to give a farewell cheer\r\nfor the flag that floated from the fort, and to look at their rifles\r\nand say, \"We are ready for whatever may come!\"\r\n\r\nTo Guy it seemed impossible that any one could long remain sad in the\r\nbeautiful country they were entering upon. As far as the eye could\r\nreach lay a vast expanse of prairie, upon which the sunbeams lay like\r\ngolden halo, making the long, rich grass of one uniform tint of pale\r\ngreen. Then a gentle breeze would come and ruffle the surface of this\r\nvast sea of vegetation, and immediately a hundred shades, varying from\r\nthe deepest green to the lightest gold, would dance up and down each\r\nseparate blade, producing the most wonderful chaos of colors. A great\r\nvariety of the most lovely and delicate flowers, too, nestled beneath\r\nthe grass, and sent forth sweet odors to refresh the traveler as he\r\npassed. Guy gathered them by handsful and gave them to Aggie, who\r\nwove them into long wreaths which she hung around the wagon, when she\r\ndeclared it looked like a fairy bower.\r\n\r\nAt midday they stopped to rest. The mules and oxen were turned out to\r\ngraze on the luxuriant grass, and a small party of the men rode a short\r\ndistance from camp in search of game. Guy would have greatly liked\r\nto accompany them, but as Mr. Harwood did not tell him to do so, he\r\nremained contentedly behind, assisting his mother to take care of the\r\nbaby, and anxiously wondering when she would become strong and well,\r\nfor she still looked as pale and weak as when they left W----.\r\n\r\nHe was speaking to his mother of this and hearing very thankfully her\r\nassurance that she felt better, if she did not look so, when Gus and\r\nGeorge came up to him, and rapidly told him that their father had gone\r\nto the hunt and had left his powder flask behind and that their mother\r\nsaid he was to take it to them.\r\n\r\n\"But he is on horseback,\" said Guy, \"and I should never be able to walk\r\nfast enough to overtake him. I'll go and speak to Mrs. Harwood about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed you won't!\" exclaimed George, \"she says you are not to bother\r\nher, but to go at once. You will be sure to meet papa, because he said\r\nthey would not go farther than that little belt of cotton-wood trees\r\nwhich you see over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he did not go that way at all,\" cried Guy in astonishment. \"He\r\nleft the camp on the other side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I know that,\" returned George, \"but they were going toward that\r\nbelt of trees, anyway. Didn't papa tell mamma so, Mrs. Loring?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hallo! where has she gone to?\"\r\n\r\n\"She went into the wagon before you began to speak to me,\" said Guy,\r\nnot very well pleased with the cunning look in George's face.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, did she? All right! Here, take the flask and hurry along, or mamma\r\nwill give it to you for lagging so. I wish I could go with you and see\r\nthe hunt.\"\r\n\r\nGuy was so fearful that he would do so whether he had permission or\r\nnot, that he hurried away without farther thought, and was soon quite\r\nalone on the great prairie. I think he would not have gone so fast had\r\nhe heard George's exultant laugh as he turned to Gus with the remark,\r\n\"Isn't it jolly he's gone, but if you tell that I sent him away, I'll\r\nbreak your bones.\"\r\n\r\nGus had a very high regard for his bones,--perhaps rather more than\r\nfor the truth,--for he promised very readily to say nothing of what had\r\npassed, and indeed thought it an excellent joke, and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Guy walked on in the direction George had pointed out to him,\r\nwondering as he forced his way through the tall grass, how Mr. Harwood\r\ncould consider it enough of importance to send him with it. He walked a\r\nlong distance without finding any traces of Mr. Harwood and his party,\r\nand looking back saw that the wagons appeared as mere specks above the\r\ngrass. For a moment he felt inclined to turn back, but he remembered\r\nthat his mother had told him always to finish anything he undertook to\r\naccomplish, and so stepped briskly forward quite determined to find Mr.\r\nHarwood if it was at all possible to do so.\r\n\r\nIt was a long time before he looked back again for he did not like to\r\nbe tempted to return, and when he did so he was startled to find that\r\nthe wagons had entirely disappeared. In great affright he looked north,\r\neast, west and south, but all in vain.\r\n\r\nAt first he ran wildly about, uttering broken ejaculations of alarm,\r\nthen he sat down and burst into tears, it was so dreadful to be on\r\nthat vast prairie alone. He soon grew calm for his tears relieved his\r\novercharged heart. He arose and looked carefully around, and for the\r\nfirst time noticed that the trees which had seemed but a short distance\r\nfrom the camp, looked as far off as ever.\r\n\r\n\"It is plain,\" said he to himself, \"that those trees are at a great\r\ndistance. Of course, Mr. Harwood could calculate their distance though\r\nI could not, and would certainly never have ventured so far to hunt.\r\nGeorge must have been mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nThen he wondered that the flask he had so long carried in his hand had\r\nnot oppressed him by its weight. With many misgivings he opened it, and\r\nfound that he had been most basely, cruelly deceived. The flask was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nI think it is not surprising that Guy was very angry, and made some\r\nvery foolish vows as to how he would \"serve George out\" if he ever\r\ngained the camp again. Ah! yes, if he ever gained it! But the question\r\nwas how he was to do so, for the long prairie grass quite covered the\r\ntracks he had made and he was uncertain from what point he had come,\r\nand there was nothing in that great solitude to indicate it.\r\n\r\nOh, how Guy wished that the tall grass, which he had thought so\r\nbeautiful, was level with the earth, \"Then I should be able to see\r\nthe wagons,\" he thought, \"but they have now moved on into some slight\r\nhollow, and I may never see them more.\"\r\n\r\nOh! how bitterly he reproached himself for his foolish trustfulness\r\nin George Harwood, and again for ever having persuaded his mother to\r\nundertake such a perilous journey. For even then he thought more of his\r\nmother's sorrow than his own danger, saying again and again: \"I shall\r\nbe lost, and my mother's heart will break. Oh, my dear, dear mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" he exclaimed aloud, after spending a few moments in such\r\nsad reflections, \"it is no use for me to stand here. There is one thing\r\ncertain, I can meet nothing worse than death on this prairie if I go\r\nback, and if I stay here it will certainly come to me, so I will try to\r\nmake for the wagons, and if I fail I shall know it is not for the want\r\nof energy.\"\r\n\r\nSo he forced his way again through the rank grass, this time with his\r\nback to the belt of trees, though he knew that they were growing by the\r\nside of water, for which he was eagerly wishing, for the sun was very\r\nhot, and as he had taken nothing since morning he was fast becoming\r\nfaint with hunger and thirst.\r\n\r\nAt last the air grew cooler and a slight breeze sprang up, but although\r\nit refreshed Guy's weary body, it brought nothing but anguish to his\r\nmind, for he knew that the sun was setting.\r\n\r\nIn despair he lifted his voice and halloed wildly, crying for help from\r\nGod and man, but no answer came, while still the sky grew a deeper\r\nblue, the sun a more glorious scarlet, till at last when it had gained\r\nits utmost magnificence, it suddenly dropped beneath the prairie, the\r\ngreen grass grew darker and darker, and at last lay like a black pall\r\naround poor Guy, as he stood alone in the awful solitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a time poor Guy sat upon the ground helpless, and hopeless,\r\nlistening intently to the rustling movements of the numerous small\r\nanimals, that wandered about seeking food; fearing to move, lest he\r\nshould encounter a prairie wolf, or some other ferocious beast, and\r\nequally afraid to remain still, lest they should scent him there.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing he could do, he felt then, and that was to put\r\nhis trust in God, and entreat His guidance and protection. So, in the\r\nagony of his terror, he prostrated himself upon the ground, and offered\r\nup his petitions. The very act of praying comforted him, and when he\r\nlifted up his eyes, he was rejoiced to see a few bright stars shining\r\nin the sky.\r\n\r\n\"I think the moon will rise in about an hour,\" thought Guy, looking\r\neagerly around, with a faint hope that she might even then be peering\r\nabove the horizon; and truly, like a far off flame of fire, she seemed\r\nto hang above the prairie grass.\r\n\r\nWith great joy Guy waited for her to rise higher, and throw her\r\nglorious light across the wild, but she appeared almost motionless;\r\nand in much amazement at the singular phenomenon, he involuntarily\r\nwalked rapidly toward the cause of his surprise, looking intently at it\r\nstill. Suddenly he paused, and burst into a fit of laughter, exclaiming\r\nrapturously; \"It is no moon; it is a camp fire! There! I can count one,\r\ntwo, three, of them, They are the fires of our own camp. Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nIn his excitement, he ran eagerly forward, shouting and laughing, but\r\nwas suddenly tripped by the thick grass and thrown headlong. As he was\r\nquite severely hurt, he walked on much more soberly, but still at a\r\nbrisk pace, towards the steadily brightening fires.\r\n\r\nThe moon he had so anxiously looked for, gave no indication of her\r\npresence in the heavens, and so Guy's progress was much retarded for\r\nthe want of light, for the stars were often overwhelmed by great banks\r\nof clouds, and gave but a feeble ray at best.\r\n\r\n\"It is becoming very cold,\" thought Guy as he shivered in the rising\r\nwind, \"I fear there is going to be a storm; Oh, what will become of me\r\nif it finds me here!\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly he paused, thinking for a moment that he heard shouting at\r\na distance, but he listened for a long time, and heard no more, and\r\ncontinued his walk slowly and wearily, quite unable to repress his\r\nfast falling tears. He was so very tired, so hungry, and so cold, it\r\nwas with the utmost difficulty he could force his way through the\r\ncoarse grass. Very often too he was startled by some prowling animal,\r\nand thought with horror of all the tales he had read of boys being torn\r\nto pieces by wild beasts. He especially remembered one he had read in\r\nan old primer, of little Harry who was eaten by lions for saying \"I\r\nwon't\" to his mother. He was thankful to know, that there were no lions\r\non the prairies, and that he had never said \"I won't,\" to his mother,\r\nbut he very much feared he had said things just as bad, and that\r\nprairie wolves, or even a stray bear, might be lying in wait to devour\r\nhim for it.\r\n\r\nJust as he had reached this stage of his reflections, he fancied he\r\nheard some animal in pursuit of him. Without pausing even for an\r\ninstant to listen, he set off at full speed toward the still glowing\r\nfires, till his precipitate flight was arrested by some obstacle, over\r\nwhich he fell, reaching the ground with a shock that almost stunned him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he recovered his senses, he attempted to rise, but to his\r\ndismay, found that he could not stand. A sudden twinge of pain in his\r\nright ankle prostrated him, as quickly as if he had been shot.\r\n\r\nHe thought at first that his leg was broken, but after a careful\r\nexamination, came to the conclusion that his ankle was sprained, but\r\neven a broken leg would not have been a greater misfortune then, for he\r\nwas unable to walk, and was suffering the most excruciating pain.\r\n\r\nI think no one can imagine what poor Guy suffered, for the rest of\r\nthat long night. There he lay helpless, in sight of the camp fires,\r\nbut quite unable to reach them or to give any indications of his\r\nwhereabouts to his friends. There he lay dying with pain, and hunger,\r\nand cold, yet suffering more in mind, than from all of these bodily\r\nevils, because he knew that his mother must know of his absence from\r\nthe camp, and was wildly bemoaning the loss of her only child.\r\n\r\nThe long wished-for moon at length arose, hours after Guy had expected\r\nher, but too soon he thought when she made her appearance, for the camp\r\nfires grew dim beneath her rays, and he had to strain his aching eyes\r\nto see them at all. But he had not long to bemoan her presence, and to\r\nsay, that she hid the light of home from him, for she soon plunged into\r\na great bank of clouds; a fearful blast of wind swept by, and Guy was\r\ndrenched with rain.\r\n\r\nOh, it was terrible, that passing storm! Short as it was, it appeared\r\nto Guy to last for hours, long after it had passed over him, he heard\r\nit wildly sweeping on, but as it grew fainter, and fainter, the\r\ncalmness that came upon the night overpowered him, and he fell into a\r\ntroubled sleep. It seemed but a short time before he again awoke, yet\r\nthe grey dawn was struggling in the east, and the little birds were\r\nhopping from blade to blade of the wet grass twittering cheerily as if\r\nto thank God for the refreshing rain.\r\n\r\nPoor Guy saw all this as if in a dream. He fancied he had been\r\ntransformed into an icicle, and that some one had built a fire at his\r\nhead, and was slowly melting him. He had no idea where he was, and\r\ntalked constantly to his mother, whom he fancied was beside him,\r\nentreating her to put out the fire that was consuming him.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he heard his name called, and realizing his position, and\r\nspringing to his feet, in spite of his wounded limb, halloed loudly,\r\nwaving his white handkerchief and signaling frantically to a horseman\r\nthat appeared in the distance. For a few dreadful moments he was\r\nunheard, and unseen, then a shout of joy, answered his screams, and the\r\nhorseman galloped rapidly toward him, and in a few minutes the poor boy\r\nlay fainting, but saved, in the arms of James Graham!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuy knew no more for many hours. When he regained his senses, he found\r\nhimself in Mrs. Harwood's wagon lying upon one of the divans. His\r\nmother was bending anxiously over him, and burst into a flood of joyful\r\ntears when she saw that he recognized her. Nothing could exceed Guy's\r\njoy at seeing her again though with traces of deep anxiety upon her\r\nface. Indeed, so delighted was he at his escape from death, that he\r\nwas inclined to regard every one with favor! Even George Harwood, who\r\na few days after his return to the camp, came to him, according to his\r\nfather's instructions, to confess his unkindness and to ask pardon for\r\nthe pain he had caused him.\r\n\r\n\"I just thought I would send you off on a fool's errand,\" said he,\r\n\"but I never thought you would go so far, and frighten us nearly to\r\ndeath, and most kill yourself. I was so scared when you didn't come\r\nback I didn't know what to do. Father missed you, but thought you were\r\nsomewhere about the wagons, and I dared not tell him you were not;\r\nbut Gus turned coward during the afternoon, and told that I had sent\r\nyou away--and _then_ didn't I catch it?\" and George grimaced most\r\ndolefully, pointing to poor Guy's sprained ankle, and declaring that\r\nthe pain of that was nothing to what he had had in his back for days\r\npast.\r\n\r\nMrs. Loring came in then, and sent him away, as Guy had been ill with\r\nfever ever since his night's exposure, and could bear but little\r\nexcitement. It was nearly two weeks before he could rise, and they\r\nhad even then to carry him from place to place, because he could not\r\nbear his weight upon his wounded limb. It fretted him sorely when they\r\ncamped at night, to see how hard she must have worked while he lay\r\nill; yet he could but perceive that she looked better and stronger\r\nthan she had done since his father's death, and joyfully felt that the\r\nexcitement and toil of a journey across the plains would restore his\r\nmother to health, whatever might be the effect upon him.\r\n\r\nHow kind they all were to him during the time he was slowly regaining\r\nhis health and strength. Aggie sat by him constantly, in her childish\r\nway telling him of the wonders she daily saw, or coaxing him to tell\r\nher some pretty tale. Mrs. Harwood always smiled upon him when she\r\npassed, and Amy and Carrie Graham often asked him to their wagon, and\r\nlent him books, or talked to him of the home they had left, and that\r\nwhich they hoped to find.\r\n\r\nAll the men missed Guy so much, he had always been so useful and\r\ngood-natured. Mr. Harwood daily said, that there should be a jubilee\r\nin camp when Guy got well again. But he recovered so gradually that he\r\ntook his old place in the train by almost imperceptible degrees, and\r\nwas at the end of a month as active as ever.\r\n\r\nThey were then on the borders of the Rio Platte, or Nebraska River,\r\nin the country of the Pawnee Indians. They were about to leave behind\r\nthem the vast, luxuriant prairie, and enter upon what may more properly\r\nbe called the plains. Guy was not sorry to see the thick grass become\r\nthinner and thinner, for he remembered that amid its clustering\r\nblades he had nearly lost his life, and therefore looked with much\r\ncomplacency upon the broad, shallow river, along which their course\r\nlay; the sandy loam beneath their feet, and the sand hills that arose\r\nlike great billows of earth, rolling in regular succession over the\r\nlevel surface. George and Gus thought the country most dreary and\r\nwretched, and would scarcely believe Guy, when he told them of a desert\r\ncalled Sahara, that had not even a blade of grass upon it, save an\r\noccasional oasis, many miles apart, and which were often sought for,\r\nby the weary traveler, as he had himself sought the camp, during his\r\nterrible night on the prairie.\r\n\r\n\"It can't be worse than this,\" they eagerly contended, \"I don't believe\r\neven Indians live here.\"\r\n\r\nBut they were soon convinced to the contrary, for a few days afterwards\r\nGuy startled them by the exclamation \"see the Indians! There are the\r\nIndians coming!\"\r\n\r\nGeorge very boldly told them to \"come on,\" but Gus went close to Guy,\r\nand declared that such mere specks as they saw in the distance couldn't\r\nbe Indians; yet was suddenly most anxious to know whether they were\r\ncannibals, and if so, whether he looked a tempting morsel or not.\r\n\r\nGuy could not help laughing at his questions, although he himself felt\r\nquite uneasy at the approach of the wild hunters of the prairies, which\r\nwere seen rapidly drawing near to them. The men in the train formed a\r\ncloser circle about the wagons, and hastily inspected their rifles,\r\nwhile Mr. Harwood gave them instructions how to proceed in case of an\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nThat, however, he did not greatly apprehend, as they soon perceived\r\nthe Indians were but a small party of middle-aged, or old men, and\r\nsquaws, and it is seldom such a party attempts to molest any number of\r\ntravelers.\r\n\r\nHowever, Mr. Harwood thought it best to keep them at a safe distance,\r\nand when they approached within a hundred yards of the train, suddenly\r\ncommanded them to halt by raising his right hand with the palm in\r\nfront, and waving it backward and forward several times. They, upon\r\nthis, stopped their horses, and consulted together a few moments, then\r\nfell into a posture indicative of rest. Then, Mr. Harwood raised his\r\nhand again and moved it slowly from right to left. This they understood\r\nto mean \"who are you?\" One of the oldest of them immediately replied by\r\nplacing a hand on each side of the forehead, with two fingers pointing\r\nto the front, to represent the narrow, sharp ears of a wolf.\r\n\r\n\"They are Pawnees,\" said Mr. Harwood. \"Ah! there is the chief making\r\nsigns that they wish to talk with us.\"\r\n\r\nA long conversation by means of signs, in the use of which the prairie\r\nIndians are very expert, was then carried on between Mr. Harwood and\r\nthe old chief. Remembering his promise to Aggie, to protect her from\r\nthe Indians, Guy went to Mrs. Harwood's wagon to assure her there was\r\nno danger, and that he would remain near, and then took a stand behind\r\nthe wagon where he could see and hear all that passed.\r\n\r\nHe was soon joined by George and Gus, for Guy was always so calm and\r\ncollected that they felt quite safe near him, though he was no stronger\r\nor older than themselves.\r\n\r\nThey all watched the Indians with much interest, and were surprised\r\nto see that instead of being giants, as accounts of their cruel and\r\nwonderful deeds had led them to expect, they were of medium height. In\r\nplace of the horrible face, and the flaming eyes they had pictured,\r\nthey saw the countenances of these Indians were intelligent, and\r\nalthough of course of a bright copper hue, were in some instances quite\r\nhandsome. The hair of the men was very long, and streamed like black\r\npennants, upon the wind. Their arms, shoulders, and breasts were quite\r\nnaked, and their dress consisted only of deer skin, with a cloth wound\r\naround the lower part of the body. One or two were covered with buffalo\r\nrobes, of which every warrior carries one, in which he wraps himself\r\nwhen cold.\r\n\r\nGuy thought that the men as they sat proudly upon their beautiful\r\nhorses, holding in their hands long bows made of the tough wood of the\r\nosage orange, which is as supple as elastic, looked very noble and\r\nfine. Their bows were about eight feet long and were wound around with\r\nthe sinews of deer, and strung with a cord of the same. The arrows were\r\nabout twenty inches long, of flexible wood, with a triangular point\r\nof iron at one end, and two feathers intersecting each other at right\r\nangles, at the opposite extremity.\r\n\r\nThis description Guy quoted to his companions, from a book he had once\r\nread, and they saw at once how perfectly true it was. While they were\r\nastonished at the appearance of the men, they were much diverted at\r\nthat of the women. They were very short and ugly; each had her hair\r\ncut short, and they were dressed the same as the men with the addition\r\nof a skirt of dressed deer skin. Their faces were tattooed in the most\r\nuncouth devices, and altogether they appeared quite hideous, as they\r\nsat upon their horses, in the same position as the men, regarding\r\nwith much interest the movements of their chief who had been made to\r\nunderstand that he might come alone to the train.\r\n\r\nAt first, he seemed doubtful about the propriety of such an act, but\r\nhis wish for gain soon overcame his caution, and he rode up to Mr.\r\nHarwood, making many signs and protestations of friendship, which were\r\nreturned most graciously. After a long series of compliments had passed\r\nbetween them, the old chief gave Mr. Harwood to understand that his\r\npeople were hungry and needed sugar, corn, and many other things. Mr.\r\nHarwood replied by saying there were many deer upon the prairie, which\r\nthey could kill, that they themselves had but little provision but\r\nwould give them some beads, and bright paints, in token of the good\r\nfeeling of the whites toward them.\r\n\r\nAt that the old man was delighted, for the Indians are very fond of\r\nbeads and all kinds of ornaments, and of paints, with which they daub\r\ntheir faces and arms in the most grotesque manner, upon any grand\r\noccasion. But the old chief disdained to exhibit any satisfaction, and\r\nsmoked the pipe, that had been offered him, in the most indifferent\r\nmanner while the presents were being procured from the wagons.\r\n\r\nWhen the old man had entered the camp, George and Gus thought it\r\nprudent to retreat to their mother's wagon, from whence, they could\r\nlook out and see all that was going on. Aggie, on the contrary was so\r\nanxious to have a nearer view of the Indians, when she found them so\r\nmuch less terrible than she had imagined, that she begged her mother to\r\nallow her to stand with Guy outside the wagon, and after some little\r\nhesitation, Mrs. Harwood permitted her to do so.\r\n\r\nWhen Guy lifted the little girl from the wagon, the savage gave a grunt\r\nof surprise, and gazed for a long time upon her with such evident\r\nadmiration that Guy was greatly afraid he would take a fancy to carry\r\nher off. But Aggie, herself entertained no such fears, and after\r\nlooking at the old man curiously for some little time, approached him\r\nslowly and examined his strange dress, the circular shield covered with\r\nbuffalo hide that was strapped on his left arm, and the formidable\r\nwar-club that lay at his side. It was made of a stone, about two pounds\r\nin weight, round which a withe of elastic wood was bound, being held in\r\nits place by a groove which had been formerly cut in the stone. The two\r\nends of the withe formed a handle about fourteen inches long, and were\r\nbound together with strips of buffalo hide, which rendered it strong\r\nand firm, totally preventing it from either splitting down, or breaking\r\nwhen used, as no doubt it often was, with great force, upon the heads\r\nof unfortunate enemies.\r\n\r\nThe old chief allowed Aggie to examine all those things with the\r\ngreatest good nature, and when she touched his quiver of arrows,\r\nand asked him to give her one, he grunted assent; so she took the\r\nprettiest one, and after admiring it for some time, nodded and smiled,\r\nand walked toward Guy with the prize in her hand. But immediately the\r\nIndian darted to his feet, frowning with anger, and sprang toward the\r\nfrightened child. Mr. Harwood and most of the men believed for the\r\nmoment that he was indeed about to attempt to carry her off, and with\r\nloud voices bade him stand back, and levelled their rifles upon him,\r\nto enforce obedience. The old man raised his hand, and immediately the\r\nwhole force on the prairie commenced galloping toward them.\r\n\r\n\"Aggie give him his arrow!\" cried Guy at this juncture, \"he\r\nmisunderstood you; he thinks you have stolen his arrows! Give it to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nShe did so, the old man released her, and she fled to the wagon like a\r\nfrightened deer. With a few expressive gestures Guy explained to the\r\nIndian the mistake that had been made, and at the same time it became\r\nevident to Mr. Harwood and his party. The chief signaled to his party\r\nto retire, and in less time than it has taken to describe it, peace\r\nwas restored; whereas but for Guy's presence of mind a terrible battle\r\nmight have followed Aggie's innocent freak.\r\n\r\nBut, notwithstanding that peace had been restored, they were all\r\nglad when the chief took up his presents and went back to his motley\r\nfollowers, and even more so, when they put their horses to their utmost\r\nspeed, and returned to their lodges; where no doubt they gave to their\r\ntribe an astounding account of the adventure of their chief in the camp\r\nof the white man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time after the encounter with the Indians, which happily ended\r\nso peacefully, the train moved on without meeting with any adventures.\r\nGeorge and Gus thought the days passed very drearily, and longed for\r\nsome excitement, but Guy was altogether too busy to feel dull. Mrs.\r\nHarwood's baby was quite sick, and as Mrs. Loring's time was fully\r\ntaken up in attending to him, Guy had double work to do.\r\n\r\nYou would be surprised if I should tell you half that he did. Of all\r\nthe fires he built; the oxen he fed; the water he carried, and even the\r\nbreakfasts and suppers he helped to cook. And he did it all in the best\r\nmanner of which he was capable too. Although the first biscuits he\r\nmade were heavy, the next were light as down, for he inquired into the\r\ncause of his failure and rectified it, and by doing that in every case\r\nhe soon learned to do perfectly all that he undertook.\r\n\r\nMost children would have thought the life of constant toil which\r\nGuy led very wretched indeed; but he did not, for he had daily the\r\ngratification of perceiving that the great object of their journey\r\nacross the plains was being gradually accomplished; his mother's health\r\nwas slowly becoming strengthened, by every step they took toward the\r\nsnowy mountains, beyond which lay the fruitful valleys in which they\r\nhoped to find a home.\r\n\r\nBut, as the days passed by, they greatly feared that one of their\r\nnumber would never reach there; the baby boy grew worse. The cooling\r\nbreezes that brought health to his weakly sister, seemed fraught with\r\ndeath for the lately blooming boy. Guy was greatly saddened by the\r\nsufferings of the child, and by the grief of its parents, and shuddered\r\nwhen he saw the bones of animals which lay by thousands bleaching upon\r\nthe desert, and once was filled with horror on coming across a human\r\nskull, which the prairie wolves had dragged from some shallow grave,\r\nand separated far from its kindred bones. The idea that the body of the\r\npoor little baby should meet such a fate, filled him with sorrow, and\r\nalthough it had always seemed to him a natural and peaceful thing that\r\nthe temple of clay should rest under its native dust, after the flight\r\nof the soul, he thought that the Indian mode of sepulture, of which\r\nthey saw examples every day, by far the best.\r\n\r\nVery often they saw a curious object in the distance, and two of the\r\nparty, riding forward to examine it, would report an Indian place of\r\nburial. Guy had himself gone forward once and found, to his surprise,\r\ntwo forked poles, some six or eight feet high, supporting something\r\nwrapped in a blanket. This something was a dead Indian, who in this\r\nstrange position, with his weapons in his hands, was waiting his\r\nsummons to the \"happy hunting grounds.\"\r\n\r\nOn his return to the train, Guy hastened to find Aggie, to tell her of\r\nwhat he had seen. She was listening very attentively, when George ran\r\nup, exclaiming: \"Look at the rats! there are thousands of rats on the\r\nplains!\"\r\n\r\nAggie looked in the direction indicated by her brother, and crying:\r\n\"Oh, the dreadful rats,\" was about to run away, when Guy stopped her,\r\ntelling her, laughingly, that they were the wonderful little prairie\r\ndogs, of which they had heard so much.\r\n\r\nTruly enough when she gained courage to look at the little animals,\r\nshe saw that although they at first sight resembled rats, on closer\r\ninspection they appeared even more like squirrels. The children were\r\ngreatly entertained by watching their quick, active movements, as\r\nthey darted about through the low grass. A very busy community they\r\nappeared to be, and with plenty to gossip about. To Aggie's delight\r\nGuy pretended to translate their quick, chirruping barks into our own\r\nlanguage. Some he said were telling how a monster rattlesnake had come\r\nto visit them without any invitation, and that the only food he would\r\neat, was the youngest and fattest of their families; and that their\r\nconstant intruders, the owls, had the same carnivorous tastes, besides\r\nwhich they rendered themselves particularly disagreeable, by standing\r\nin the doors and staring at every dog that went by, and even preventing\r\nthe entrance of visitors, to the great distress of all the belles and\r\nbeaux in town.\r\n\r\nAll this may have been very true, for the excited little creatures\r\ntalked so continuously that I am sure they must have had some\r\ngrievance, and the children thought it must be the owls that stood\r\nsolemnly at the entrance of many of the burrows. They did not see\r\nthe rattlesnakes, so even Aggie somewhat doubted the tales of their\r\nferocity, which Guy said the little prairie dogs related.\r\n\r\nBut although these little creatures were such chatterers, they appeared\r\nvery industrious, for many hillocks of sand indicated where their homes\r\nwere burrowed. Each little hole was occupied by a pair of dogs, one of\r\nwhich was often seen perched on the apex like a sentinel. But like\r\nmany other sentinels, they appeared on the watch for danger, not to\r\ncombat, but to avoid it, for they darted like a flash into their holes\r\nwhenever a lean, prowling wolf stalked near them, or even a prairie hen\r\nflew by.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would tell us a story about prairie dogs,\" said Aggie to\r\nGuy, that evening when they were gathered around the camp-fire.\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid it is impossible for me to do that,\" he replied, \"for very\r\nlittle seems to be known about them. Naturalists have never paid much\r\nattention to them, curious as they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Indians must know something about them,\" said Gus.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose so,\" returned Guy, \"for before the white man came to\r\nannoy them, they had nothing to do but to watch animals and learn their\r\nhabits, that they might know which were fit for food, and which was\r\nthe easiest way of killing them. Ah, yes, now that I have been thinking\r\nabout it, I do remember a story that the Indians tell about the prairie\r\ndogs!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh tell it!\" cried Aggie, eagerly; Gus seconded the request, and even\r\nGeorge drew nearer, for Guy had a great reputation as story teller in\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\n\"It is rather a long tale,\" said he, \"but the Indians say, a true\r\none. It happened years and years ago when each animal understood the\r\nlanguage of all others, and men conversed with them as readily as with\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\"In those days each tribe had its sorcerers, or wise men, who pretended\r\nto cure not only all diseases but to control the destinies of men. They\r\nwere accordingly held in great veneration by their simple-minded dupes,\r\nas are their few descendants, which even at this day practice in a\r\nlesser degree the arts of their forefathers.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it happened that when these men were more powerful among the\r\ntribes than the chiefs themselves, that they combined together to wrest\r\nfrom the hands of these the commands that they held, in order that they\r\nmight hold the people both in bodily and mental subjection. There had\r\nfor a long time existed a tradition among them, that when a daughter of\r\na chief--an only child,--should love a brave of an unfriendly tribe,\r\nthey would have power to change her into a flower or animal, and unless\r\nthe brave should find the means within ten moons, or months, to break\r\nthe enchantment, she would die, and with her every chieftain and his\r\nfamily. Accordingly these wicked sorcerers found constant pretexts for\r\ninvolving the tribes in war, especially if they supposed that the only\r\ndaughter of a chieftain loved a brave of another tribe; but for many\r\nyears all their arts were in vain, for the Indians were so passionate\r\nand revengeful that immediately an affront was given or received,\r\nviolent hatred vanquished love, and the chiefs and their families were\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n\"The sorcerers were almost in despair of ever obtaining the entire\r\nauthority they craved, when it came to pass that two rival tribes met\r\nupon the plains, and as was usual in such cases, a battle was fought.\r\nThe Ohoolee tribe were victorious, and killed many of the Gheelees\r\nand also took many of them prisoners. Among the latter, was the only\r\ndaughter of the chief Sartahnah, the beautiful Mahdrusa.\r\n\r\n\"Great was the consternation of her tribe, for this maiden was held\r\nmore precious by them than a hundred braves. She was more graceful than\r\nthe fairest flower that grew upon the prairie; her hair was longer\r\nthan the grass by the riverside and blacker than the night; her eyes\r\nwere like those of the young fawn, and her voice was sweeter than a\r\nbreeze laden with the song of birds. There was not a chieftain or brave\r\nof the Gheelee's but would have laid down his life for her, and great\r\nwas the grief and shame that befell them when she was taken captive by\r\nthe Ohoolees.\r\n\r\n\"From that day there was continual war waged between the two tribes.\r\nThe Ohoolees acted on the defensive, the Gheelees on the offensive.\r\nNever a week passed but that a party of braves went forth to attempt\r\nthe rescue of the beautiful Mahdrusa from the lodges of the enemy.\r\nThe chief, her father, to increase if possible the zeal of the braves\r\npromised her hand to him who should deliver her. There was great\r\nrejoicing when this was made known, for all loved Mahdrusa, though she\r\ncared for none. Her rescue was attempted with a thousand times more\r\neagerness than before, and one day Anoctah, the bravest of all the\r\nGheelees, led her in triumph to her father's wigwam and demanded his\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n\"Mahdrusa heard him with dismay, and clasping her father's knees, sank\r\ndown before him, and entreated him to give Anoctah some other treasure.\r\n\r\n\"The old chief told her that was impossible, and Mahdrusa wept so\r\nloudly that the whole tribe gathered about the lodge and asked what\r\nhad befallen the beautiful daughter of Sartahnah. But she would say\r\nnothing, yet wept continually, so that the sorcerers said the spirit of\r\nthe rivers was within her, and that they alone, could deliver her from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Now these men had reasoned together over her strange malady, and\r\nsaid, 'She mourns so much over her betrothal to Anoctah because she\r\nloves a brave of an unfriendly tribe. Let us then take her from her\r\nfather, and place her in the great medicine lodge where we can work our\r\nenchantments upon her, and make ourselves rulers of all the tribes.'\r\n\r\n\"So in the night they took her from her father's wigwam into the great\r\nmedicine lodge, which was hung about with the herbs they used in their\r\nincantations, and had in the centre a great heap of stones, within\r\nwhich was a fire burning.\r\n\r\n\"Beside these stones, which were kept constantly hot, they made\r\nMahdrusa sit down, and while she still wept, her tears fell upon the\r\nstones, and a great vapor arose, which the sorcerers condensed upon\r\nclay vessels into drops of water as pure as crystal, and with them and\r\nthe herbs that hung around, made a decoction so powerful that when\r\nthey had forced Mahdrusa to drink it, she lost all power and reason,\r\nand her spirit lay passive in the hands of her tormentors.\r\n\r\n\"'We will take it from her body,' said they, 'and place it where no\r\nbrave will ever discover it.\r\n\r\n\"'Let it fly to the centre of the wild rose,' said one. But the others\r\ndemurred, saying her lover would certainly seek it there.\r\n\r\n\"'Better hide it under the thick skin of the buffalo,' said another.\r\n\r\n\"'No!' they answered, 'the brave that Mahdrusa loves must be a fearless\r\nhunter, therefore his arrow would bring her forth.'\r\n\r\n\"In short, they talked of every flower and beast on the prairie, but\r\nfound in all some fault, until the most cunning of all mentioned the\r\nprairie dogs. 'No one would look for her in their miserable holes,'\r\nsaid he, 'and they are such chatterers that the magpies, themselves,\r\nwould not have patience to listen to them.'\r\n\r\n\"So it was agreed that her spirit should dwell as a prairie dog, and\r\nbefore long out sprang one from a reeking cauldron of herbs, and they\r\ntook it to the holes of the prairie dogs and left it there, placing\r\nbeside it a terrible serpent, that all others might be afraid to\r\napproach it, and an owl at the door, as a sentinel that would stand\r\nlooking patiently for an enemy both night and day, and never breathe\r\nto the gossips around her the tale of the princess that was prisoned\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\n\"And that was how the rattlesnake and owl became sharers in the homes\r\nof the prairie dogs, and it was with these awful companions that the\r\nspirit of Mahdrusa spent many weary days. Meanwhile her body lay in\r\nthe medicine lodge of her people, and the sorcerers said that her soul\r\nhad ascended to the stars, where, in ten moons, she would be purified\r\nfrom her sin and return to her body, or that it would die, and moulder\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"This news soon spread over the prairies, but the brave that Mahdrusa\r\nloved would not believe it. He knew the wicked desires of the\r\nsorcerers, and believed that she was a flower on the prairie, and that\r\nhe was appointed to rescue her.\r\n\r\n\"So he went forth and cut down every flower that he found, and he\r\ntoiled so ceaselessly that before two moons had passed not a blossom\r\nremained, and still he found not his beautiful Mahdrusa. Then he made\r\na strong bow, and arrows that could not miss the mark, and he slew the\r\nbeasts of the prairie by hundreds, yet he could not find his love.\r\nAnd so nine moons passed by, and Mahdrusa was still in her horrible\r\ncaptivity, and the brave that sought her was bowed down as if by\r\nyears, with the weight of his sorrow, and his body was so steeped in\r\nthe blood of the animals he had slain that he was redder than clay,\r\nand his descendants continue so to this very time. All the beasts of\r\nthe prairie had he slain in his terrible anger, and all the people had\r\nfled to the mountains for food, thither he thought he would follow\r\nthem, and he sat down upon a ridge of sand, to strengthen his bow, and\r\nsharpen his arrows, when, lo! quite unmindful of him, a thousand little\r\ncreatures he had fancied too insignificant to notice, sprang forth from\r\ntheir holes, and gathered in groups for their daily gossip.\r\n\r\n\"They angered him so greatly by their chatter that he placed an arrow\r\non his bow to fire amongst them, when his hand was stayed by hearing a\r\ncurious tale that a gay young dog was telling.\r\n\r\n\"'She lives next to my mother's lodge,' said he, 'and the poor thing\r\nnever appears either to eat or drink. I took her a delicate slice of\r\ncactus myself, but I dropped it in a terrible fright, for a great\r\nserpent darted towards me, and an owl sprang forward and devoured my\r\nyoungest brother before he had time to utter a squeak.'\r\n\r\n\"The brave rejoiced when he heard these words, and springing up, went\r\nin search of the captive prairie dog. Many weary days he sought in\r\nvain. He asked of her whereabouts from every insect he met, but none\r\ncould give him any information, and the prairie dogs, under the spell\r\nof the sorcerers, were silent--on that topic, at least.\r\n\r\n\"There was but a day left in which he could act. Almost in despair, he\r\nwandered about the prairie dog town, vainly looking for his love.\r\n\r\n\"At last he remembered that a queer old woman whom he had met, while\r\nhunting one day, had told him that she was his guardian fairy, and had\r\ngiven him two little pieces of stone which he was to strike together if\r\never he was in great trouble, and she would appear and help him.\r\n\r\n\"He had taken but little notice of the old woman at the time, supposing\r\nher to be a conjurer or evil worker, and he had dropped the little\r\nstones into his pouch, where they had long lain forgotten. Without\r\ndaring to hope that they would be of any use, he took them out, and\r\nstruck them together. A tiny spark of fire fell from them upon some dry\r\ngrass at his feet, a flame sprang up, and lo! out of it stepped the old\r\nwoman he sought.\r\n\r\n\"'So you have called me at last!' said she, 'what is it that I shall\r\ndo?'\r\n\r\n\"'Lead me, kind fairy, to the hiding place of the beautiful Mahdrusa,'\r\nhe replied\r\n\r\n\"So she went before him to a part of the prairie that, in all his\r\nwanderings, he had not visited. But, strangely enough, before his feet\r\nthe grass turned into briars, through which he only with the greatest\r\ndifficulty could force his way. Every timid hare became a wolf,\r\neach gentle fawn a raging buffalo, but the brave went on undaunted,\r\nbrandishing his war-club, and keeping his formidable foes at bay. Never\r\nfor a moment did he allow fear to gain possession of him for he knew\r\nif he did he should be lost. It was only faith and courage that could\r\ncarry him safely through that enchanted ground.\r\n\r\n\"'Stop!' cried the fairy, when he had passed unscathed through a\r\nthousand dangers. 'Mahdrusa is before you!'\r\n\r\n\"But before he could look for her, the owl flew like a fierce hawk\r\nin his face, and pecked at his eyes, and the rattlesnake sprang upon\r\nhim burying its deadly fangs into his arm. The brave almost lost his\r\ncourage then, but he heard Mahdrusa, though in the voice of a prairie\r\ndog, entreating him to save her. He caught the serpent in his hands,\r\nand seizing its jaws, tore it asunder, and wrapped its writhing body\r\naround his wound, while at the same moment the fairy called up a\r\nterrible wind that blew the owl far away, and to the arms of the young\r\nwarrior, the little prairie dog that held the soul of Mahdrusa.\r\n\r\n\"So was half the task of the lover accomplished; yet all his toil would\r\nbe in vain if he could not before the moon set that night place her\r\nsoul in the body it had before tenanted. But he was many leagues from\r\nthe lodge in which it lay, and he knew that by his own power he could\r\nnot hope to reach it in time, so he called upon the good fairy again,\r\nand she turned a rabbit into a fleet courser that bore the lover and\r\nthe enchanted maiden, over the prairie with the swiftness of wind.\r\n\r\n\"The moon was but a few inches, it appeared, above the horizon, when\r\nthey reached the lodge. By command of the sorcerers all the people had\r\nreturned from the mountains to see whether the spirit of Mahdrusa would\r\ncome from the stars, or her body, which all this time had lain as if in\r\na deep sleep, take upon itself the signs of death. All were gathered in\r\nthe great lodge. The cauldron of herbs from which the enchanted prairie\r\ndog had emerged was boiling over the fire, and around it the sorcerers\r\nwere standing. Before them lay the body of the beautiful Mahdrusa, and\r\nbeside it stood her father and Anoctah.\r\n\r\n\"Into the lodge, into the midst of all the people, the young brave\r\nsprang! The warriors of the Gheelees raised their war clubs when they\r\nsaw one of the hated Ohoolees, but the young brave cried, 'strike me\r\nnot, for I bear the soul of Mahdrusa!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they all fell back and Anoctah said, 'Restore it to her body, and\r\nshe shall be thine, if she loves thee better than me.'\r\n\r\n\"But the sorcerers sprang upon him, and tried to tear the little\r\nprairie dog from his bosom, but the fairy cried:--\r\n\r\n\"'Hold her with thy right hand into the cauldron and she shall be\r\nsaved!'\r\n\r\n\"So he broke away from the sorcerers and plunged the enchanted one into\r\nthe boiling cauldron, unheeding the agony he suffered or the cries of\r\nthe little animal he held, and in a moment the moon plunged beneath the\r\nhorizon; Mahdrusa arose from her long sleep; the sorcerers fell into\r\nthe boiling cauldron and were consumed; and all the people shouted for\r\njoy, and with one accord cried that the Ohoolees should from henceforth\r\nbe their brothers, and the young brave who had rescued Mahdrusa, their\r\nchieftain, when her father was called to the happy hunting grounds.\r\n\r\n\"The next day the marriage of the young brave and Mahdrusa was\r\ncelebrated with great splendor. And, behold, after the ceremony was\r\nover, a beautiful young maiden stood in the place where the old woman\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\n\"'I too was enchanted by those wicked sorcerers, and condemned to\r\nwear the form of an old woman until I should make two young hearts\r\nperfectly happy. I have completed my task to-day.'\r\n\r\n\"Then Anoctah who had been very sorrowful, looked up, and seeing the\r\nbeautiful maiden, forgot his love for Mahdrusa, and entreated the\r\nstranger to be his wife.\r\n\r\n\"She loved him well and consented, and thus made a third heart joyful\r\nas those of the young Ohoolee brave and his beautiful Mahdrusa.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they lived happily together all their lives,\" quoted Aggie, from\r\nthe fairy tales she had heard, \"Why, Guy, that was a long story,\"\r\nshe added yawning, \"and it has made me so sleepy I shall go to bed.\r\nGood-night!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" returned Guy, not very well pleased that she should be so\r\nsleepy, and fearing that his story must have been very stupid as well\r\nas long. Perhaps it was because of this, that he sat down by the fire\r\nagain when she was gone instead of going to bed as he usually did, and\r\nit was from sitting there that he got into trouble on the following\r\nday, and to tell you what his trouble was shall be the duty of the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" said George, slapping Guy on the shoulder, the moment after\r\nhis father bade them \"good-night\" and went to his wagon, telling them\r\nto go to theirs, \"I say, I have got the best thing to tell you, and\r\nwe'll have the greatest fun, if you don't turn sneak and try to get out\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not likely to turn sneak!\" retorted Guy very indignant that he\r\nshould be thought capable of such a thing. \"What are we to have such\r\nfun at? I don't think you will find that I shall shirk it.\"\r\n\r\nNow, Guy never would have said that without knowing what George's fun\r\nwas to be, had he not been vexed at Aggie's cool reception of his\r\nstory, and at some other things that had happened through the day. He\r\nwas in a very restless, dissatisfied temper, and, as many other boys do\r\nunder those circumstances, he felt like doing any wild thing that was\r\nsuggested to him, without inquiring whether it was right or wrong.\r\n\r\nGeorge saw that, and, greatly delighted, said: \"I told Gus I didn't\r\nbelieve you would back out, and we will have such a jolly time! You\r\nknow there are numbers of antelopes on the plains here, and I heard\r\nJames Graham say this morning, that there would be sure to be a great\r\nmany of them go down to that little creek to drink just as soon as the\r\nmoon rose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Guy, wondering greatly what the herd of antelopes had to\r\ndo with their fun.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" returned George, \"I have been reading a book that tells all\r\nabout hunting them. That was what I was doing when pa thought me so\r\nstudious to-day, and I found out how to hunt them at night, and it's\r\njust as easy as can be. You have only to creep up to them silently, and\r\nyou can shoot them down by dozens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like partridges?\" commented Guy, in a tone of doubt.\r\n\r\n\"You needn't laugh at what I say,\" returned George. \"You can ask Gus if\r\nit isn't so, and if you don't believe him, I'll show you the book.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! I believe it all, of course!\" said Guy, hastily; \"but I don't see\r\nwhat difference it makes to us, for we have nothing to hunt antelopes\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are plenty of guns in the wagon,\" said George, in a low voice,\r\n\"and I don't see why we shouldn't use them.\"\r\n\r\nGuy was greatly startled at this speech, for Mr. Harwood had told all\r\nthe boys never to touch one of the guns. He reminded George of that,\r\nbut he only laughed, and began a glowing account of the glorious time\r\nthey would have in creeping toward the creek, in the moonlight, and\r\nshooting down the antelopes as they bent their heads to drink.\r\n\r\nGuy's imagination was highly excited by George's words, and from being\r\nthe most unwilling, he became the most anxious that the midnight\r\nhunt should be attempted, quite forgetting Mr. Harwood's commands in\r\nthinking of the triumph they might have in the morning, in exhibiting\r\ntwo or three dead antelopes.\r\n\r\nHe readily assented to George's proposition, that they should then\r\nproceed to the wagon, and choose their guns. No inducements or threats,\r\neven to the breaking of his bones, would induce Gus to touch one.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said George, \"you shall carry this small hatchet, and a knife,\r\nso that we shall be able to cut the horns and tails off the antelopes\r\nthat we can't bring home with us. I don't suppose we shall be able to\r\ncarry more than one apiece.\"\r\n\r\nAfter securing their guns, they left the camp very cautiously, each\r\none going a different way, and all meeting at a point about a quarter\r\nof a mile from the camp, on the banks of the little stream, where they\r\nexpected the antelopes would come to drink.\r\n\r\nThey stayed there in silence for some time, for Guy, remembering his\r\nformer experience on the prairie, was afraid to venture for even a\r\nmoment out of sight of the camp-fires. But at last they all became\r\nso impatient at remaining so still and seeing nothing, that they\r\nventured, very cautiously, a little farther up the stream. Guy took the\r\nlead, and very often would stop, and motion to his companions to do\r\nlikewise, whenever he fancied he heard any noise.\r\n\r\nThus two very tiresome hours passed away, and Gus was very crossly\r\nprotesting against staying any longer, when Guy motioned him very\r\neagerly to be still, and with great triumph pointed to a number of\r\nanimals that, one by one, very slowly and cautiously, were going down\r\nto the water to drink.\r\n\r\nThey were very slender and graceful, about the size of a small deer,\r\nand covered with coarse, wiry hair, and bearing upon their small,\r\nwell-formed heads a pair of branching horns.\r\n\r\nThey descended to the water, without exhibiting any signs of suspicion\r\nor fear, for the boys, quite by accident, had got to the leeward\r\nof them--that is, where the wind would not pass from them to the\r\nantelopes, and give to the keen animals notice of their presence.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" whispered Guy, excitedly, \"wait until you see them stoop their\r\nheads to drink, and then fire at them! Now--ready!\"\r\n\r\nBoth boys raised their guns and fired. There was a terrible concussion.\r\nBoth were thrown flat upon their backs, with the idea that their\r\nheads, or at least their noses, were shot off, and away stampeded the\r\nantelopes, as fast as their slender legs would carry them.\r\n\r\nGus began to howl and cry most wildly, believing that his brother and\r\nGuy were both killed. They, however, soon convinced him that they\r\nwere both alive, by rising, each declaring his nose was broken, and\r\npointing to the flowing blood as proof of it.\r\n\r\nGeorge was terribly enraged, chiefly at the gun, which he declared had\r\n\"kicked\" him. Guy, on his part, was very much vexed with George, for\r\nhaving brought him on such a profitless adventure; but though he was\r\nsuffering very much from his rashness, the whole thing appeared to him\r\nso ridiculous, that he laughed long and heartily.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you would laugh if you were dying,\" grumbled George, as they\r\nstood together by the side of the creek, washing their face. \"Pretty\r\nfigures we shall make to-morrow, sha'n't we? And pa will give it to you\r\nto-morrow, too, for taking the guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told me to do it!\" retorted Guy, sullenly, but quite alarmed at\r\nthe thought of Mr. Harwood's impending wrath, as well as angry at\r\nhimself for having done anything to incur it.\r\n\r\nGeorge answered him very rudely, and then followed a quarrel between\r\nthe two, which was at last brought to an abrupt termination by a\r\nterrible scream from Gus. They looked toward him, and saw, with horror,\r\nan immense panther, but a short distance off, making ready for a spring.\r\n\r\nThe boys were transfixed with horror, as they saw his glaring eyes\r\nfixed upon them.\r\n\r\nThey saw him crouch like an immense cat, preparing to spring upon its\r\nprey. They saw a sudden flash of fire before their eyes, heard the\r\nreport of a gun, and, with as much fear as joy, beheld the terrible\r\nmonster spring high into the air, and fall to the ground, tearing up\r\nthe ground with its claws, and foaming at the mouth, in agony. Another\r\nshot ended its struggles and its life together.\r\n\r\nThe boys uttered cries of joy for their delivery from the terrible\r\ndeath with which the panther had threatened one, or perhaps even all,\r\nof them; but they were very much frightened to see that their deliverer\r\nwas Mr. Harwood.\r\n\r\nHe looked at them very sternly and said--\r\n\r\n\"You may be very thankful that I heard the reports of your guns and\r\ncame in search of you, or your disobedience might have been punished\r\nmost fearfully.\"\r\n\r\nWith great sorrow and shame they felt that his words were true, as they\r\nstood beside the dead panther, and looked at his long claws, and the\r\nfirm white teeth in his large mouth.\r\n\r\nGus burst into tears, and said he knew the horrible creature was making\r\nstraight for him, and eagerly assured his father that he would never\r\ndisobey him again in his life.\r\n\r\nGeorge and Guy were quite ready to make the same promise, but Mr.\r\nHarwood looked so stern that they dared not speak to him, and Guy felt\r\nutterly wretched when, instead of scolding him, Mr. Harwood looked at\r\nhim very sorrowfully, and said:\r\n\r\n\"I am disappointed in you, Guy! I thought I could trust you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next thing, I heard the reports of the guns, and immediately\r\nsurmised where you were. I was so anxious about you, that I would not\r\ncall one of the others, but came immediately in pursuit of you, and it\r\nis well that I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"How was the baby, when you left?\" asked the conscience-stricken Guy.\r\n\r\n\"Dying,\" returned Mr. Harwood, emphatically.\r\n\r\nGuy waited to hear no more, but darted forward, reaching the camp\r\nsome minutes before his companions. He saw that several in the train\r\nwere up, and some called after him, asking where he had been. Without\r\nstopping to answer them, he ran on to Mrs. Harwood's wagon, and seeing\r\nit all alight within, sprang to the front, and hastily putting the\r\ncanvas door aside, asked how the baby was.\r\n\r\nHis mother came over to him, crying and wringing her hands--\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Guy!\" she cried, \"where have you been? How wicked you were to\r\nleave us so, when the baby was dying!\"\r\n\r\nGuy knew not what to say--he had no excuse to offer, for he never\r\nthought of putting the blame on George. He, therefore, kept silent, and\r\nin a most miserable state of mind, followed Mr. Harwood and his sons to\r\nthe camp.\r\n\r\nGus kept close to his father all the way, crying out every minute or\r\ntwo that he saw another panther, and at last asking how it was that\r\ntheir absence from camp was discovered.\r\n\r\n\"The baby was very ill,\" answered Mr. Harwood, gravely. \"He was in\r\nconvulsions, and your mother wanted to put him in a hot bath. I went to\r\ncall Guy to help us, and then found you were gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what did you do then?\" asked Gus.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, mother!\" he cried, \"is he dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered. \"He died while you were laughing and sporting.\r\nI should think you would never enjoy yourself again, while you can\r\nremember that.\"\r\n\r\nGuy looked at the little babe, lying dead on its mother's lap, and\r\nthought, indeed, that he never should be happy again. Aggie added to\r\nhis distress by looking at him sternly, with her widely-opened eyes,\r\nand crying:\r\n\r\n\"Go away, you bad, bad boy! I will never love you again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Harwood will never trust me,\" thought Guy, bitterly, as he\r\nleft the wagon, and passed Mr. Harwood and his sons, who were about to\r\nenter it.\r\n\r\nGuy slept but very little that night; in the first place, his bruised\r\nface was very painful, and he was, besides, haunted by the remembrance\r\nof Mr. Harwood's reproachful glance, when he had said he had been\r\ndeceived in him; and he wondered if he would carry into execution the\r\nthreat he had made before they left home, and greatly feared that he\r\nwould, for he felt that he had been quite disobedient, and seemingly\r\nungrateful enough, to be left alone on the prairie.\r\n\r\nThe train did not move on as early the next morning as usual, for the\r\npoor little baby was buried upon the banks of the little stream where\r\nthe boys had so nearly lost their lives.\r\n\r\nGuy thought he had never witnessed so sad a scene as when they laid the\r\nbeautiful baby, that looked as pure and sweet as a white lily, in the\r\nrough coffin that some of the young men had hastily made, and carried\r\nhim to a lonely spot, that perhaps no feet had ever trod before, and,\r\nbreathing a prayer over him, left him to his long sleep, far from the\r\nplace of his birth, or that for which his kindred were bound, and where\r\nnever a tear would be dropped above him, or a sigh breathed.\r\n\r\nGuy's only comfort was, and, perhaps, too, that of the poor baby's\r\nfather and mother, that he could not be quite alone, even when they\r\nleft him, for God would watch over him; and he could not but rejoice\r\nthat they had not been forced to leave him in the shifting sands of the\r\ndesert, but that a green tree bent over him, and grass would spring\r\nabove the sod in which he lay.\r\n\r\nPoor little Aggie was quite brokenhearted at the loss of her poor\r\nlittle playfellow, and, quite forgetting her anger went to Guy for\r\ncomfort.\r\n\r\nAfter he had said all he could to cheer her, he told her of his own\r\ntroubles, and how sincerely sorry he was, for having disobeyed her\r\nfather. Aggie listened very attentively, and at last said:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps papa will forgive you. I know he will, if you go to him and\r\ntell him how sorry you are, and promise him you will never be so wild\r\nand disobedient again.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will,\" said Guy readily. \"I would do anything to merit his\r\nkindness once more.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was several days before Guy could summon courage to speak to Mr.\r\nHarwood, who treated him very coldly, seldom asking him to do anything,\r\nand never intrusting the care of even the slightest article to him.\r\nGuy every day grew more and more miserable, while Gus and George\r\ncongratulated themselves upon their father's silence, and almost forgot\r\nthat they had ever incurred his displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"But, if the baby hadn't died, wouldn't he have 'whaled' us, though!\"\r\nejaculated George, one day.\r\n\r\nGuy was shocked and surprised to hear him speak so lightly, and,\r\nwithout more ado, left him, and going to Mr. Harwood, told him how\r\ngrieved he was for his disobedience, and begged him to forgive him, and\r\nrestore him to his confidence again.\r\n\r\n\"I will forgive you, Guy,\" said Mr. Harwood, kindly; \"but I cannot\r\nplace any trust in you again, until you show yourself worthy of it.\r\n\r\n\"I will show myself worthy!\" exclaimed Guy, firmly. \"I will, indeed,\r\nMr. Harwood, and at the same time show my gratitude for your kindness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely a week passed before Guy fulfilled his promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I believe it is snowing over yonder,\" cried Aggie to Guy one day,\r\npointing to the west, where, truly enough, as far as the eye could\r\nreach, the earth appeared perfectly white.\r\n\r\n\"It does look like snow,\" returned Guy, looking intently in the\r\ndirection she indicated, \"but it is now June, and we certainly ought\r\nnot to encounter such a fall as that appears to be, besides, there is a\r\nperfect glare of sunshine there! Ah, I have it! That is not snow, but\r\nalkali!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is alkali?\" asked Aggie. \"Is it cold! Will it melt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered Guy, \"let us ask Mr. Graham, he will be able\r\nto tell us all about it.\"\r\n\r\nSo that very evening when the train stopped to encamp for the night,\r\nthey waited until Mr. Graham had finished his work, and Guy had done\r\nall that was required of him, and then went to the camp-fire of the\r\nGrahams.\r\n\r\nThey were very warmly welcomed, for both Guy and Aggie were great\r\nfavorites of them all, and after they were all quietly seated, Guy\r\npointed to the desert of alkali that shone like crystal beneath the\r\nbeams of the moon, and asked Mr. Graham if he could tell them of what\r\nit was composed, and how it came there.\r\n\r\n\"Of the last I can say nothing,\" returned Mr. Graham, \"except that it\r\nwas placed there by an all-wise Creator for some good purpose. The\r\nsubstance itself is a sulphate of soda, and is generally found near\r\nsulphur, and soda springs. A fall of rain usually brings it forth\r\nfrom the earth it impregnates in great quantities, and it looks very\r\nbeautiful. The white particles often assume the most delicate shapes,\r\nlike flakes of snow for instance, or most delicate leaves, and ferns.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be very glad when we get there,\" said Aggie, \"I shall think we\r\nare passing a winter in fairy lands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am afraid you will think it a very disagreeable winter,\"\r\nreturned Mr. Graham, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Aggie, opening wide her eyes in astonishment. \"Is it cold\r\nthere? I thought that the sun shone as warmly there as it does here.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it does,\" replied Mr. Graham. \"It will not be of the weather that\r\nyou will complain, but of what you call the beautiful snow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! yes, perhaps the glare will hurt my eyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it very likely, Aggie,\" said Amy Graham, \"but my brother was\r\nnot thinking of that, but of something much worse. These alkali salts\r\nare very poisonous, and often kill people if they are partaken of even\r\nslightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" ejaculated Aggie and Guy at once.\r\n\r\n\"I'll never touch them!\" continued the latter, \"and I am so sorry I\r\ncan't, because I thought it would be so nice to eat some, as if it was\r\nsnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should never think of eating it,\" said Guy. \"And I think Aggie would\r\nnot when she had once seen what kind of a substance it is,\" said Mr.\r\nGraham, \"for it looks much more like powdered washing-soda than snow,\r\nand tastes more like it too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I am sure I wouldn't take enough even to make my mouth taste\r\nbadly!\" exclaimed Aggie, with a gesture of disgust.\r\n\r\n\"I thought the same at one time,\" said Mr. Graham, \"yet it was only a\r\nvery short time afterwards that I was nearly killed by partaking of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" cried both the children, eagerly. \"Do tell us about it, Mr.\r\nGraham.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I will,\" he answered, kindly. \"I believe I have told you\r\nbefore that this is not the first time I have been across the plains. I\r\nmade my first trip before gold was discovered in California, and when\r\nfew people thought of going there.\r\n\r\n\"There was then no well defined route such as we have been following,\r\nand when we reached the alkali desert we lost trace of any road, and\r\nhad to depend entirely upon our reasoning powers for guidance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hadn't you any compass?\" asked Guy.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Mr. Graham, \"but as we were rather uncertain\r\nwhich direction we ought to take, it was not of much use to us. Before\r\na week was over, both ourselves and the cattle were quite worn down\r\nwith our tiresome march across the glaring, blinding desert. Our\r\ncondition daily grew worse, for all sickened, and suffered dreadfully\r\nfor want of water, for there was none to be found but that which was\r\nimpregnated with soda. Many of the people drank it, and became very\r\nsick; the weary oxen quaffed it from the little pools, formed by\r\nthe rain, by the wayside, and daily two or three died, and we were\r\ncompelled to leave them to bleach as white as the alkali around them.\r\nFor my part, I drank no water for days; enduring the agonies of thirst\r\nin silence, and praying that we might soon find relief. One day, one\r\nof my comrades died, he had borne the torture attending abstinence as\r\nlong as possible, and then had drank to repletion, and been poisoned.\r\nThere had been a heavy shower, and he had been quite unable to resist\r\nthe temptation it offered. Two days after, it rained again, and I was\r\nalmost as imprudent as my friend had been, and was immediately taken\r\nso ill that I feared I should share his resting-place. I never shall\r\nforget how rejoiced I was when we got into a pure atmosphere and\r\nhealthy soil again, but it was weeks, yes, even months, before the\r\neffects of my poisoned draught passed entirely away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me,\" cried Aggie, in dismay, \"are there no June springs in the\r\nalkali desert! Oh, dear! dear! just think of having come so far just to\r\nbe poisoned!\"\r\n\r\n\"We will see that you do not drink after a shower,\" said Mr. Graham,\r\nlaughing. \"But even the little birds could do that here. And indeed\r\nthere will be no necessity for you to do so, as several springs have\r\nbeen discovered since the time I spoke of.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you hadn't told me about it,\" said Aggie, sadly, \"I shall think\r\nall the time of the poor creatures that have been poisoned. I don't\r\nlike to hear of such dreadful things, even if they are true. I would a\r\ngreat deal rather hear a pretty story. Miss Carrie, won't you tell me\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\"My brother has told you of something that once happened to him,\"\r\nshe replied, readily, \"and now, if you like, I will relate a little\r\nadventure that befell me when I was a little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that will be splendid, Miss Carrie. Do tell us all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must tell you, in the first place,\" began Miss Graham, when she had\r\ndrawn Aggie nearer to her side, so that she should not lose one word\r\nshe was about to say, \"that I was not at all a good little girl at the\r\ntime the event I am going to tell you of, took place, and you must not,\r\ntherefore, be surprised to hear of any naughty actions I used to do.\r\n\r\n\"My favorite ones were those by which I could frighten people. Nothing\r\nused to delight me so much as to tell ghost stories to my younger\r\nbrothers and sisters and leave them without explaining them, when often\r\nthe poor little creatures would become nearly convulsed with terror,\r\nand my mother would find great trouble in quieting them. I had often\r\nbeen scolded, and even whipped for my malicious mischief but all to no\r\npurpose, and at last no notice was taken of me, and I thought my father\r\nand mother had made up their mind to let me tell horrible stories until\r\nI was tired of them. My parents often went out in the evening to the\r\ntheatre, or some party and on such occasions it was my usual practice\r\nto coax my brother Charlie, and sister Amy into the dining room with\r\nme, while the nurse put my youngest brother to bed. When I had, by dint\r\nof threats, and persuasions, got them into the room, I would make them\r\nsit by the fire suddenly put out the candles, and begin some dreadful\r\nstory. Generally the nurse came in the middle of it and carried them\r\naway to bed, where they would cower under the blankets and tremble at\r\nevery sound.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" interrupted Aggie, \"I used to do that after George had told\r\nme stories. But did you believe what you used to tell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"'No, my love, although I have indeed told such horrible things, as\r\neven to awaken my own fears. Generally however, I laughed heartily at\r\nthe idea of ghosts and said I should like to see one.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh don't say so,' said Amy, one night. 'What should we do if one\r\nshould appear?'\r\n\r\n\"'I do wish one would,' returned I, 'how you would run.'\r\n\r\n\"Just then I heard a terrible crash, as if all the crockery and tinware\r\nupon the kitchen dressers had tumbled down.\r\n\r\n\"'What can that be,' I cried in alarm.\r\n\r\n\"'What?' asked my brother, very quietly.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you deaf?' I retorted. 'Don't you hear that dreadful noise? There\r\nit is again. Oh, what shall I do?'\r\n\r\n\"It was no wonder I was frightened for there sat my brother and sister\r\nas if they heard nothing, while every moment the noise grew louder. I\r\nhad always thought myself a very brave girl before, but I shook with\r\nalarm at these unearthly sounds, and shrieked with terror when the\r\ndoor opened, and a terrible figure surrounded by blue flame entered the\r\nroom. I pointed at it in speechless horror. It towered nearly to the\r\nceiling and looked down upon me with eyes that glowed like coals. It\r\nheld in its hand a whip made of snakes with which it menaced me. For a\r\nfew seconds I could neither move nor speak, while my brother and sister\r\nlaughed and talked as if nothing unusual was going on. I was convinced\r\nthat this revelation from the spirit world was made to me alone, and I\r\nwas overwhelmed by the fear that I was to be carried away bodily, to\r\nanswer before the ghosts I had derided. The monster advanced toward me.\r\nWith a shriek I bade it begone! it laid its death cold hand upon me\r\nand--\"\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, Miss Carry, don't tell any more.'\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was so horrible!\" cried Aggie, clasping Guy's arm lightly. \"Oh\r\ndear, dear, didn't you die with fright?\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears not,\" returned Miss Graham, laughing, \"but I do not know\r\nbut I should have done so, had not my brother James rushed into the\r\nroom, caught hold of the supposed ghost and cried, 'there there, that\r\nwill do Tom! Don't you see the poor child is nearly frightened to\r\ndeath.'\"\r\n\r\n\"So it wasn't a real ghost after all,\" exclaimed Aggie, in a tone of\r\nmingled disappointment and relief.\r\n\r\n\"No, it was not a real ghost after all, but only a very good sham\r\none, that was made up by my brother and cousin to frighten me out of\r\nmy propensity of frightening others, and you may be sure it did so. I\r\ndidn't think I ever afterwards told a ghost story of which I could not\r\nas readily give an explanation as of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you frightened me though,\" said Aggie, drawing a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"But you are not frightened now, darling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why of course not Miss Carrie.\"\r\n\r\n\"But do you know I think I would rather hear that pretty little story\r\nabout the 'Christ-child,' that you told us a few evenings ago, or one\r\nof those little poems of which you know so many.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not think I can remember any to-night,\" said Miss Carrie, \"but\r\nperhaps Amy can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please try dear Miss Amy,\" cried Aggie running to her, \"Mr. Graham,\r\nand Miss Carrie have both told us a story, and now if you will repeat\r\nsome pretty poetry it will be so nice.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Amy laughed pleasantly, and lifted Aggie on her lap. \"My pet,\"\r\nshe said, \"yesterday I heard you ask your mother what she thought the\r\nprettiest thing in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" cried Aggie, \"and she couldn't decide. What do you think\r\nthe prettiest Miss Amy? But then perhaps you are like mamma, you think\r\nthere are, so many beautiful things in the world that you can't choose\r\nbetween them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Miss Amy sweetly though gravely, I have decided. \"Now\r\nlisten to me a few minutes and you shall know what is to me\r\n\r\n\r\n                 FAIREST AND BEST:\"\r\n\r\n     \"There came a child to my side one day,\r\n       And lightly she said with a laugh of mirth,\r\n     'Tell me of all things, now I pray,\r\n       Which is the fairest to you upon earth?\r\n\r\n     \"'Is it the rose, with its breath of balm?\r\n       Is it the gem of the diamond mine?\r\n     Is it the shell, with its sea-song calm?\r\n       Or the pearl, that low in the deep doth shine?'\r\n\r\n     \"I answered her, 'Though the rose is fair,\r\n       Though the diamond gleams like a lesser sun;\r\n     Oh, ne'er can _they_, e'en in thought compare,\r\n       With my chosen beauty, my purest one.\r\n\r\n     \"'For mine, far sweeter than rose doth bloom,\r\n       In our world of sorrow, of woe, and care;\r\n     E'en light of the diamond seemeth gloom,\r\n       To that halo divine that shineth where;\r\n\r\n     \"'My fairest thing upon all the earth,\r\n       _A little child_ kneeleth down to pray,\r\n     And sweeter than sound of ocean's mirth\r\n       Are the heav'nly words, she doth meekly say.\r\n\r\n     \"'Yes, as I look on a kneeling child,\r\n       Of those I think, whom our Saviour blest,\r\n     And I know of all things fair and mild,\r\n       The pure, young heart of a child is best.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle Aggie remained perfectly still for some moments after Miss Amy\r\nhad finished. At last she lifted up her face, and kissed the young lady\r\nsweetly, and whispered, \"Dear Miss Amy I will try to remember that. I\r\nam sure Mamma thinks the same as you do. Thank you for telling me.\r\nGood-night my dear Miss Amy. Good-night Miss Carrie, and Mr. Graham. We\r\nhave had such a nice time haven't we Guy. Now we will go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, and good-night Mr. Graham, and Miss Carrie. Come, Guy, let\r\nus go home.\"\r\n\r\nSo Guy arose and led the little girl toward the wagon she called\r\n\"home,\" for to her little affectionate heart any where was home where\r\nher parents stayed. They were walking slowly past the baggage wagons\r\nwhen to his surprise, and affright Guy saw a puff of smoke, issue\r\nfrom the back part of the one in which he usually slept. He instantly\r\nremembered the powder, and with a cry dashed toward it, bidding Aggie\r\nrun as far as possible from the danger. There was no water near, but\r\nhe caught up a bag of flour, sprang into the wagon and dashed it upon\r\nthe flames, then another, and another. Meanwhile his cries had brought\r\nevery one to the spot, James Graham brought a pail of water and threw\r\nupon the already smothered flames, and immediately a great sputtering,\r\nand kicking was heard, and George Harwood sat up sleepily and demanded\r\nwhat they were pitching into him for.\r\n\r\n\"Get up,\" said his father who was looking very pale and agitated, \"Get\r\nup and thank this brave boy for having saved your life. If it had not\r\nbeen for him this powder would have exploded, and launched you, and we\r\nknow not how many others into Eternity.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge saw how great his danger had been, and with shame owned that he\r\nhad brought it upon himself, by dropping fire from a pipe which he was\r\nendeavoring to learn to smoke, in express disobedience of his father's\r\ncommands.\r\n\r\nHe turned around to thank Guy for having risked his own life to save\r\nhis, for that he had undoubtedly done by springing into the burning\r\nwagon, but found that like a true hero, he had gone to perform another\r\nduty, waiting neither for thanks or praises. But he got both, for as\r\nhe lifted little Aggie into her mother's wagon, she kissed him and\r\nwhispered \"You good, brave boy, I am going to ask God to bless you all\r\nyour life.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Well now, George,\" said Aggie the next morning, as they stood near\r\nthe partially burned wagon and watched Mr. Harwood and his young men,\r\nas they hastily endeavored to repair the damage that had been done, \"I\r\nshould think you never would smoke again in your life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't smoke last night,\" retorted George, \"I only tried to, and to\r\ntry to smoke and to do it are two very different things, I can tell\r\nyou,\" and George grimaced most comically at the remembrance of some\r\nvery extraordinary sensations he had experienced, both before and after\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't believe me you can try it,\" he added, as Aggie looked at\r\nhim thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't thinking of what you were saying,\" she replied, \"but of what\r\na horrible death Guy saved you from.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a fact,\" returned George, with much seriousness. \"Guy ain't a\r\nbad sort after all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit of a Guy Fawkes about him,\" commented Gus. \"He don't believe\r\nin blowing up folks with gunpowder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor with words either,\" interrupted Aggie, \"but who was Guy Fawkes,\r\nGus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, a man put a lot of gunpowder in the cellar of the English House of\r\nCongress.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of Parliament,\" corrected George.\r\n\r\n\"Of Parliament, then, it means all the same thing, and he intended when\r\nthe King and all the members of Parliament were in the house to set\r\nfire to the powder and blow them all up. But they found out the plot\r\njust in time, and Guy was hung up; or had his head chopped of, I forget\r\nwhich.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good for him\" said George. \"Hullo, here comes Guy, looking really\r\nfrightened for once in his life! What is the matter, Guy?\"\r\n\r\nBut Guy made him no answer, but hurried on to Mr. Harwood and whispered\r\na few words in his ear.\r\n\r\n\"You don't say so!\" he ejaculated with a startled look. \"Whereabouts\r\nare they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Back of the camp, sir. Mr. Graham says he thinks they are after the\r\ncattle and horses. But they are to far off for us to see them plainly,\r\nand it was some time before I could make Mr. Graham believe they were\r\nIndians at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indians!\" exclaimed George and Gus, turning pale, and with out more\r\nado, rushing from the spot, not only as they said \"to tell mother,\" but\r\nto gain a place of safety.\r\n\r\n\"Take Aggie to the wagon,\" said Mr. Harwood hastily, though he could\r\nnot help smiling at the precipitate flight of his boys. \"Be as quick as\r\nyou can, and bring me my telescope.\"\r\n\r\nGuy did as he was bidden, but although so quickly that he did not even\r\ntake time to say a few words of encouragement to Aggie. He found the\r\ntelescope was little needed when he gave it into Mr. Harwood's hands.\r\nThe Indians had drawn so close that their movements could be perfectly\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n\"At least thirty young braves!\" said Mr. Harwood anxiously. \"A party of\r\nhorse thieves no doubt! We shall have trouble!\"\r\n\r\n\"And all on account of this unfortunate delay!\" exclaimed Mr. Graham.\r\n\"We should have been on our way three hours ago, but for your son's\r\ncarelessness.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is very true. Yet we should scarcely have escaped the quick eyes\r\nof these wild savages.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will try to save the oxen and horses from their hands at least!\"\r\ncried a young man, turning to a group who had hastily armed themselves.\r\n\r\nIn an incredible short space of time they had made a circle of the\r\nwagons, and within this barricade they placed the cattle, and stationed\r\nthemselves at regular distances without the wagons. Mr. Harwood\r\nand Mr. Graham stood beside the wagon in which all the ladies had\r\ncongregated, and with quiet, though great anxiety, waited for the\r\nattack to be commenced. They had no idea that it could be avoided for\r\nall Mr. Harwood's signals, during the formation of the barricade had\r\nbeen totally disregarded, and the savages in all the hideousness of\r\npaint and warlike decorations were riding rapidly around the camp in a\r\ngradually decreasing circle.\r\n\r\n\"Guy, my boy, you had better go into our wagon,\" said Mr. Harwood, as\r\nGuy, with a favorite dog at his side, drew near to him. Guy looked him\r\ndoubtfully a moment, and with visible reluctance proceeded to obey the\r\ndirection which had been given him. Suddenly, however, he turned back\r\nand with an appealing look at Mr. Harwood said:\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would give me a gun, sir, and let me stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do as you please,\" cried Mr. Harwood hastily, and Guy rushed to a\r\nwagon for the desired weapon, and back again to his place.\r\n\r\nJust then the Indians made a feint of going away. They retired slowly a\r\nlittle way, then suddenly wheeled, and galloped back towards the camp,\r\ndischarging a volley of arrows as they came.\r\n\r\nFortunately they injured no one, but the second fire was not so\r\nharmless, and was returned steadily by Mr. Harwood and his men from\r\ntheir rifles. But the Indians were too far off, and changed their\r\npositions too often to be affected by it.\r\n\r\nThe firing continued in this manner for fifteen minutes or more. Two\r\nof Mr. Harwood's men were seriously wounded, and obliged to retire to\r\nthe wagons, and the others were eagerly speaking of dividing into two\r\nparties, one of which was to remain to guard the camp, while the other\r\nsallied out to drive off the Indians. It seemed a mad undertaking, as\r\nMr. Harwood said, to divide so small a force, and they were spared\r\nthe necessity of doing so by the savages themselves, who enraged at\r\nthe death of one of their number, and confident of success, rode\r\nboldly up to the very sides of the wagons, and with showers of arrows,\r\nand brandishing their war-clubs, uttering at the same time the\r\nmost dreadful yells, endeavored to overcome the white men and gain\r\npossession of the animals, that snorting and plunging with terror at\r\nthe unusual rounds of shouting and firing were striving vainly to break\r\ntheir bounds. Terrible was the struggle that ensued. For a few minutes\r\nthe shrieks of the women and children, the shouts of the white men, the\r\nyells of the Indians, the reports of fire-arms, and the indescribable\r\nnoises made by the frightened animals filled the air.\r\n\r\nGuy was almost stunned with the noise and bewildered by the confusion\r\nthat prevailed. He never thought of firing his gun, and had no idea\r\nwhich party had the advantage, he, in fact, felt perfectly overwhelmed,\r\nnot with fear, but horror, and quite regardless of his danger, remained\r\nan inactive spectator of the scene, until he beheld Mr. Harwood\r\nstruggling violently with an Indian who had thrown himself from his\r\nhorse in the excitement of the fight.\r\n\r\nMr. Harwood was himself a muscular man, and the struggle between the\r\ntwo was terrible to witness. For a minute neither seemed to have the\r\nadvantage, then the strong Indian got his arm across Mr. Harwood's\r\nbreast and held him back, he raised his right hand in which glittered a\r\nlong knife already stained with blood. Some unusual sound for a moment\r\nattracted the savage's attention, he glanced around. Guy seized the\r\nopportunity, raised his gun and fired.\r\n\r\nHe was not knocked over by the shock, but the Indian was. Down he went,\r\nand Mr. Harwood with him, but only to remain there a moment. He sprang\r\nup and echoed the shout of triumph which was heard from the other side\r\nof the camp.\r\n\r\nThe fight was ended; the Indians defeated, away they sped with\r\nlightning speed, bearing their wounded, among which was Mr. Harwood's\r\nspecial adversary, with them, and leaving their dead upon the ground.\r\n\r\nOf these there were two. But little notice was taken of them at first,\r\nfor the members of the train were too busy attending to the wounded,\r\nand examining their own hurts, to think of Indians, unless it was to\r\nlook occasionally to satisfy themselves that they were really gone, and\r\nthat there was no farther trouble to be apprehended from them.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder who it was that knocked that great fellow over that was\r\nholding me down,\" said Mr. Harwood, after he had embraced his family,\r\nand assured them that he was very little hurt. \"I wish I knew who it\r\nwas, I have somebody to thank for saving my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the fellow!\" cried Gus, catching Guy as he was about to jump\r\nfrom the wagon. \"He has got one of your guns, too, and it was only a\r\nlittle while ago you told him not to touch them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Guy!\" exclaimed Mr. Harwood, \"can it be possible that you fired that\r\nwell-directed shot?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it, sir, the ball seemed to know just where to go, and\r\nthe gun to shoot of itself,\" returned Guy, with a slight laugh--a vain\r\nattempt to hide his emotion.\r\n\r\nMr. Harwood made no effort to conceal his, and catching him in his\r\narms embraced him warmly, as he exclaimed: \"My dear boy, have I then my\r\nown life to thank you for, as well as that of my son? How shall I be\r\nable to repay you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say any more,\" entreated Guy, who was being nearly suffocated by\r\nhis mother, Mr. Harwood and the children, who were pulling him hither\r\nand thither to their heart's content.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you shoot his head right off?\" ask George, when the\r\ncommotion had slightly subsided. \"I would if I had had a gun, and been\r\nin your place.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you weren't at all likely to be in his place or any other where\r\narrows were flying,\" interrupted Gus, with a laugh, which quickly\r\nsubsided into a smothered titter as George looked at him, with the\r\nremark: \"You had better mind your bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"I intend to,\" said Gus, coolly, \"but you needn't glare at me so.\r\nYou're not a Gorgon, I guess, and can't turn me into stone by a look.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad Guy didn't knock the Indian's head right off,\"\r\ninterposed Aggie, anxious to prevent a quarrel between the two boys.\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you glad of it, Guy, you wouldn't have liked to have killed him\r\ndead, would you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!\" returned Guy, laughing. \"It answered my purpose just to kill\r\nhim a little. Indeed,\" he added, turning pale at the thought, \"I hope\r\nthe poor man will not die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble yourself about that,\" said Mr. Harwood, taking in his\r\nhand the gun which Guy had still retained, but then offered him, \"you\r\nnobly did your duty, my boy, and though we will hope that the man will\r\nrecover, we will not worry, because we cannot learn whether he does or\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say, the men are harnessing the teams,\" exclaimed George. \"Let us go\r\nand pick up some of the arrows the Indians threw around so plentifully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Guy, \"and I'll bring you one, Aggie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay,\" said Mr. Harwood, \"Here, Guy, is a more fitting weapon for you.\r\nTake this gun, and though I hope you may never again be obliged to use\r\nit against a fellow-creature, I hope your shots will always be as well\r\ndirected as that of to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whew!\" ejaculated George, \"don't I wish I had knocked that fellow over\r\nto-day! Guy, why don't you say thank you?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's like the little boy that would not say 'thank you' for a new\r\njack-knife,\" laughed Gus, \"he'd rather use the old 'un fust.\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, Guy was so delighted with Mr. Harwood's words, and the gift\r\nthat accompanied them, that he knew not what to say. To possess a gun,\r\nhad long been his highest and most secret ambition, and to have one,\r\nreally his own, in his hands, seemed, as he afterwards said, \"far too\r\ngood to be true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind the thanks,\" exclaimed Mr. Harwood, as Guy vainly tried to\r\nutter something, \"we understand each other, though my debt is not paid\r\nyet. You can go now and look for arrows, if you like.\"\r\n\r\nBut Guy thought but little of arrows, or even of his gun, for some\r\nminutes after he left the wagon, for just then four of the mules, who\r\nhad not recovered from their fright, broke away from the men who were\r\ntrying to quiet them, and galloped across the plains in the opposite\r\ndirection to that the Indians had taken. Two young men immediately\r\nmounted the swiftest horses in the train and set off in pursuit, and\r\na fine chase they had. Over an hour passed before they brought the\r\nrefractory animals back, and an exciting time the boys had watching the\r\nrace, and shouting and hurrahing when the foaming, panting creatures\r\nrushed into the camp, followed by their almost breathless pursuers.\r\n\r\n\"But this isn't finding arrows!\" said Guy, at last, suddenly\r\nremembering Aggie, and the promise he had made her. And, after the\r\ntrain was in motion, he found two beautiful arrows, and took them to\r\nher. She accepted them with delight, telling Guy she would keep them\r\nall her life, in remembrance of that eventful day. \"And so you see,\"\r\nshe added, addressing in fancy the cross old chief that had frightened\r\nher so terribly, \"I have got one of your Indian arrows, after all, and\r\nI'll keep it too. My good Guy has got a gun now, and that's more than\r\nyou have, and he knows how to use it, that's more than you will ever\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo weeks after the fight with the Indians, Guy was galloping across\r\nthe gently rising hills, that denoted their approach to the Rocky\r\nMountains, in quest of game. This was the first time he had had an\r\nopportunity offered him to try his gun, as they had seen no living\r\ncreature upon the desert of alkali which they had occupied more than a\r\nweek in crossing, and but few among the prickly pears and sage-brush\r\nthat succeeded the poisonous salts. Of the effects of the latter, each\r\nmember of the party had had some experience, and all, for weeks after,\r\ncomplained of sore lips, chapped hands, and other pains of a like\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nGuy was greatly troubled to find that little Aggie and his mother were\r\nthe greatest sufferers. Indeed, the latter became so very ill that, for\r\ntwo or three days, Guy feared he should soon be motherless. Never had\r\nhis heart been so heavy as during that time. It was a good thing for\r\nhim that he was obliged to work additionally hard, else he might also\r\nhave fallen ill from excessive grief. But, as it was, he had no time to\r\ngive way to his feeling: there were his mother's duties and his own,\r\nto be performed by his hands alone; little Aggie to be amused, and his\r\nmother often to be cheered by some gay word, when he usually felt much\r\nmore like uttering sad ones.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned before that Mrs. Loring, though a very good woman, was\r\noften inclined to look on the dark side of things, and so it sometimes\r\nhappened that she led Guy to do the same, and he certainly did so\r\nsteadily enough during the days his mother lay seriously ill, while he\r\nturned to the bright side instantly when she pronounced herself better,\r\nthough he did not for a moment neglect to pay her the same attention as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when she, for the first time, gathered strength and energy\r\nenough to sit up, Mr. Harwood entered the wagon, and laughingly told\r\nher that as she was so well, he should not let her have Guy to herself\r\nany longer, but should take him with them to hunt some deer that were\r\nfeeding on the hills some distance away. Guy looked at his mother and\r\nhesitated, for though he desired, above all things, to take part in a\r\ndeer hunt, he did not like to leave his sick mother, until she said:\r\n\"Go, my child, you are looking pale and thin already, the excitement\r\nwill do you good. It would never do for you to get sick, you know.\"\r\nAnd that was how Guy Loring happened to be galloping across the hills\r\nwith Mr. Harwood and Mr. Graham, while George and Gus remained at the\r\ncamp, enviously watching him. By some skillful manoeuvering, they\r\nmanaged to approach within gun-shot of the deer, of which there were\r\nfive or six, brousing quietly. Guy was very much excited, and would\r\nhave fired upon them had not Mr. Harwood told him not to do so until\r\nthe last.\r\n\r\nSlowly, and with as much patience as they could command, they drew\r\nnearer and nearer the deer. Mr. Graham and Mr. Harwood raised their\r\nrifles to fire, when suddenly the whole herd of deer threw their heads\r\nin the air, looked around wildly, and bounded away with the speed of\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world could have startled them so?\" exclaimed the\r\ngentlemen in surprise.\r\n\r\nGuy looked around in perfect dismay at having lost the chance of firing\r\nat a deer, and quickly exclaimed: \"Oh, how provoking, it is the cattle.\r\nThey have let the cattle loose.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graham uttered an exclamation of delight, \"Was there ever such good\r\nluck before?\" he cried, \"Those are buffaloes! I had no idea we should\r\nfind them here so early. Gallop back to the camp, Guy, and tell the\r\nFraziers! Hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nScarcely less excited than Mr. Graham, Guy made a wide circuit of the\r\nspot where the herd of buffaloes, from twenty to thirty in number, were\r\nfeeding, and galloped to the camp, where he found five or six young\r\nmen, already armed and mounted for the chase. They hastily advised\r\nGuy to remain in camp, but as he had received no direction to do so\r\nfrom Mr. Harwood, he followed his inclinations, and returned with the\r\nyoung men to the spot where Mr. Graham and Mr. Harwood were anxiously\r\nawaiting them.\r\n\r\nAll this time the buffaloes continued to feed without taking the least\r\nnotice of the hunters. These after a short consultation, began to ride\r\ngently towards them. The animals remained so quiet that Guy had an\r\nopportunity to look at them carefully. He was surprised to find that\r\nthey were not as large as elephants, but on the contrary about the size\r\nof a cow, which animal they closely resembled in the shape of their\r\nbodies, and limbs; but their hair, instead of being of the same length\r\nall over their body, grew in shaggy tufts upon the back and sides, and\r\nlengthened into a sweeping mane upon the neck. This adornment took from\r\nthem the peaceful expression of the majority of our domestic cattle,\r\nand gave them instead the terrible one of the untamed lion. This effect\r\nwas increased by the wild glare of their eyes. Guy did not at first\r\nnotice their horns, which were small, and almost imbedded in their\r\nthick, woolly hair, but it did not need a second look to assure him\r\nthat they could do a great deal of harm, if once called into service.\r\nThe hunters approached the buffaloes in a semi-circle, Guy occupied\r\na place near the circle by the side of Mr. Harwood, who unwilling to\r\ndisappoint him by sending him back to the camp, had permitted him to\r\nstay. The whole party got within a hundred feet of the buffaloes before\r\nthey were even discovered. Then an immense fellow who seemed the leader\r\nof the herd, began to bellow, and tear up the earth with his hoofs, and\r\nin a moment, the whole herd were coursing over the prairie at a pace,\r\nwhich Guy, when looking at their heavy bodies, had never imagined them\r\ncapable of.\r\n\r\n\"After them!\" shouted Mr. Graham, and instantly the hunters spurred on\r\ntheir horses many of which were used to the sport, and in a few minutes\r\nGuy, who was poorly mounted was left some distance in the rear, while\r\nthe foremost of the horsemen were at the very heels of the flying herd.\r\nThe dust of the prairie began to rise from beneath their hoofs in\r\nclouds, through which Guy could indistinctly see the buffaloes dashing\r\nforward, one turning occasionally upon some audacious man who had fired\r\nupon him, who would then wheel his horse quickly and escape from the\r\nreach of the infuriated animal, which would continue its flight or fall\r\nto the earth, with a terrible bellow.\r\n\r\nGuy had witnessed three or four such falls, and in his excitement\r\nscarcely knowing what he did, went up to the foaming animal intending\r\nto put it out of its misery by a shot from his gun, when, suddenly,\r\nit rose to its feet, staggered forward, and ere Guy could wheel his\r\nfrightened horse, plunged his horns into his breast, and buffalo, horse\r\nand rider rolled upon the plain together.\r\n\r\nThen succeeded a horrible moment, in which Guy felt himself crushed by\r\nhis plunging horse, and heard the cries of the men, the bellowing of\r\nthe wounded buffalo, the thunderlike noise of the retreating herd, and\r\nthe sharp crack of half a dozen rifles. Then he felt himself lifted\r\nfrom the ground by Mr. Graham and Mr. Harwood, who exclaimed that it\r\nwas a miracle that he was alive, and asked him if he wasn't killed, and\r\nthen shouted out for somebody to go in pursuit of the horse, which was\r\ngalloping away in the opposite direction to the buffaloes, which were\r\nsuffered to depart without any further attempt being made to slaughter\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGuy was surprised and delighted to find that his fool-hardy escapade\r\nhad brought upon him no injury except a few bruises, which, however,\r\ndid not prevent him from assisting the men to take into camp the\r\ncarcasses of the three buffaloes they had slain.\r\n\r\nThat proved a busy afternoon in the camp. The buffaloes were skinned,\r\nand their shaggy hides hung up in the sun to dry. Then the choicest\r\nparts of the bodies were cut up and salted, and the rest left to the\r\nhungry wolves, who are the natural enemies of the buffalo--one of\r\nwhich, when wounded, they will often follow, and harass to death.\r\n\r\nAnd what a splendid supper of buffalo steak they had. Guy fancied he\r\nnever had tasted anything so delicious, though George, in his usual\r\ncontradictory mood, declared he thought beef much nicer. But as no one\r\npaid any attention to him, his opinion had not much effect, and no one\r\nenjoyed the supper the less for it.\r\n\r\nAs only a slight sketch of Guy's wonderful escape had been given by\r\nHarwood upon his return to camp, the children were anxious to hear a\r\nfull account of it, and as soon as the dishes were washed, the fuel\r\nfor the night brought in and Guy was at liberty to take his usual seat\r\nby the fire, they called upon him to tell them all about it. He did\r\nso in as few words as possible, for he felt as much ashamed of his\r\ndiscomfiture as an old hunter might have been likely to do.\r\n\r\nAggie looked very serious after hearing the account of her favorite's\r\ndanger. George laughed as he thought of the figure Guy must have cut\r\nwhen pitched from his horse over the back of the buffalo; and Gus with\r\ngreat earnestness asked him what he thought of at the time it all\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\"I saw and heard too much to think of anything,\" replied Guy, quite\r\nunable to repress a laugh at Gus' question and eager look, \"the first\r\nthing I thought of when Mr. Graham took me from the ground was to clear\r\nthe sand from my nose, eyes, and mouth. If you had seen me you would\r\nhave fancied I had been burrowing in the dirt for a twelve month. After\r\nthat I was very thankful that I escaped so well, and on the way home I\r\nrecalled to mind almost everything I had ever read about buffaloes, and\r\namong other things a mode in which the Indians hunt them, and which is\r\ndescribed in the adventures of Lewis and Clarke.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who were Lewis and Clarke?\" asked Gus.\r\n\r\n\"Two men, who in the days of Washington and Jefferson, and chiefly by\r\nthe aid of the latter, headed a party of men, who were the first to\r\nexplore Oregon, and discover the rise of the Columbia and Missouri\r\nRivers.\"\r\n\r\n\"What fun they must have had,\" exclaimed George, \"among the Indians\r\nthat had never seen a white man before.\"\r\n\r\n\"They were so constantly surrounded by dangers,\" said Guy, \"that I\r\nguess they found the _fun_ rather scarce. But they had a great many\r\nexciting adventures among the Indians, and learned many of their\r\nstrange habits.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you were going to tell us about a way they had of hunting\r\nbuffaloes,\" interrupted Gus. \"How was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, first they would find, either by accident or after a search, a\r\nherd of buffaloes, grazing on a plateau, perhaps three or four hundred\r\nfeet above the river, for such are very often found a mile or more in\r\nlength along the Columbia or Missouri Rivers, which abruptly terminate,\r\nforming a precipice so perfectly perpendicular that neither man or\r\nbeast can gain a foothold on their sides.\r\n\r\n\"Toward this precipice a young warrior wrapped in a buffalo robe, and\r\ncrowned with the head and horns, decoys the game, while the others\r\nchase them forward, riding their swiftest horses, bearing their best\r\narms, and uttering their wildest shouts. The whole herd maddened by\r\nthe hunters, will usually follow the decoy--their fancied leader--when\r\nsuddenly he will hide beneath some cliff, the buffaloes will rush on,\r\nseeing no danger ahead, or unable to check their headlong career, and\r\nthus very often a hundred or more will spring over the precipice, and\r\nbe dashed to pieces on the rocks below.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried George, excitedly.\r\n\r\n\"And just think then what a good time the Indians have picking up the\r\npieces,\" commented Gus, \"I'd like to see them do it. Just think of two\r\nor three hundred Indians all at work together, jerking the meat, and\r\nshouting and dancing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, yes. That's all very well!\" said Aggie, thoughtfully. \"But I\r\nwouldn't like so much to be the decoy. Suppose he couldn't hide in\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes he can't,\" said Guy, \"and in that case he is trodden under\r\nfoot by the herd, or carried with them over the precipice. I am like\r\nyou, Aggie, I shouldn't like to be the decoy. It is bad enough to face\r\none buffalo, and I have no wish to try a hundred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" exclaimed Aggie, \"I should die with fright if I were to\r\nmeet even one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! That's because you are nothing but a girl--but boys--!\" George\r\nleft his sentence unfinished, for of late he had become very careful of\r\nboasting before Guy, whom he knew was too well acquainted with him to\r\nbe deceived by empty words.\r\n\r\n\"Girls, or no girls!\" exclaimed Aggie, a little angrily, \"I learned\r\nthose verses mamma gave us, to-day, while you don't know them at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Verses are only made for girls!\" answered George, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"And for some boys,\" said Guy, \"I for one like to hear them. What are\r\nyours about Aggie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen! They are about\r\n\r\n\r\n         'THE CHILDREN IN THE SKY.'\r\n\r\n     \"Little Allie, tired with roaming,\r\n       Fell asleep one summer day;\r\n     In the soft, and mellow gloaming,\r\n       That the fairies haunt, they say.\r\n     And, into her dream, there came then\r\n       Fays, or Angels pure and fair,\r\n     Filling all the lonesome glen\r\n       With sweet music, rich and rare.\r\n\r\n     \"'Child!' they said, as slow around her\r\n       One by one they floated on,\r\n     'Look into the clearer ether,\r\n       Close beside the setting sun!'\r\n     Then she looked, and lo! the cloudlets\r\n       Parted back and showed her there,\r\n     Myriad angels, sinless spirits\r\n       Sporting in a garden fair.\r\n\r\n     \"Sporting, smiling, fondly twining,\r\n       Round each other snow white arms;\r\n     While a halo o'er them shining,\r\n       Saved them from the night's alarms.\r\n     Loud they sung in notes of gladness,\r\n       Ever o'er the sweet refrain;\r\n     'Jesus loves us! we shall never\r\n       Lose His tender care again.\"\r\n\r\n     \"'Here the flow'rets bloom forever;\r\n       Here the sun of God doth shine;\r\n     Here doth flow the crystal river,\r\n       Giving all a life divine!'\r\n     Then the peerless vision faded,\r\n       And the fairies stole away;\r\n     All the dell with gloom was shaded,\r\n       Darkness 'round sweet Allie lay.\r\n\r\n     \"Then she woke from out her slumber,\r\n       And she said--within her heart--\r\n     'Shall I join that happy number?\r\n       In their joyous song take part?'\r\n     Then she prayed that God would lead her\r\n       In the path to heaven above,\r\n     And that she might dwell forever\r\n       Blessed by Christ's redeeming love.\r\n\r\n     \"And before the year was over,\r\n       God in love gave back reply,--\r\n     For He led the little rover,\r\n       To the children in the sky.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"That is a sweet little tale,\" said Guy, when Aggie had finished, \"But\r\nit is almost a pity such a good little girl should die.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the good little girls, in stories, always do die!\" exclaimed\r\nGeorge, \"And that is why I don't like to hear about them. That's the\r\nreason, too, that I tease our Aggie so, I want to get her into a\r\npassion so she won't get too good and be spirited out of the world\r\nright away.\"\r\n\r\nThey all laughed at this ingenious defense; and then as Guy declared\r\nhimself very tired, and quite stiff and sore from the number of bruises\r\nupon his body, they soon separated for the night, and ere long all was\r\nstill about the camp, except the fires that flickered and blazed, as if\r\nin derision of the calm night, and its heavy-eyed attendant--Sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following Saturday night found the party encamped in the very bosom\r\nof the mountains, in one of the most lovely nooks upon the surface of\r\nthe earth. As they looked around upon the verdant dell, and upon the\r\nsnow-capped mountains that arose in the distance, all the arid plain\r\nthey had passed,--the desert of alkali, and the hills of sand--seemed\r\nlike a dream, so great was the contrast between them and Virginia Dale.\r\nEven George was enraptured, and when the children as usual gathered at\r\nevening around the fire, he declared that he would go no father but\r\nturn hermit, and hunt and fish for a living, in that lovely spot.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could stay with you,\" said Aggie, \"but I shouldn't like to\r\nleave papa and mamma. But only look at the moon rising above that snowy\r\npeak; isn't it perfectly lovely?\"\r\n\r\n\"Watching the moon is all very well?\" exclaimed Gus, \"but I would much\r\nrather hear a good story. This is the very night for a story, and a\r\nsentimental one at that. Guy get your thinking-cap on, that's a good\r\nfellow!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, do!\" assented Aggie.\r\n\r\n\"I have had it tightly drawn over my ears the whole time I have been\r\nsitting here,\" answered Guy laughing, \"and the result is that I have\r\nbeen thinking of a story the Indians tell about the first snow storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes! put it all off on the Indians!\" cried Gus, \"we all know what\r\nthat means!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do they say?\" asked George, \"that they thought it was\r\nsalt, and put it into their soup, and were surprised to find that it\r\nmade it watery--and nothing more?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now don't tease Guy,\" interrupted Aggie, \"I want to know what the\r\nIndians really did say, and where the first fall of snow really was.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to my authority,\" answered Guy, gravely, \"it took place\r\namong these very mountains. Years, years ago, so many years that all\r\nremembrance of the time is now lost, and only vague reports of it\r\nremain, the snowy mountains we now see were covered with verdure, even\r\nmore luxuriant than that which makes this vale so beautiful. The long\r\nleaves, and the shining silk of the corn waved in the breeze that\r\nsoftly played about the lofty summits, lovely flowers opened, and\r\nrich fruits ripened in the warm sunshine that ever fell upon them.\r\nThe bounding deer came to the very doors of the wigwams that were so\r\nthickly placed that they seemed to form a vast city, and the very trout\r\nin the sparkling streams leaped into the hands of the happy people that\r\ninhabited this earthly paradise!\"\r\n\r\n\"Gracious, what a saving of fishing-tackle!\" ejaculated George.\r\n\r\nGuy took no notice of this irreverent remark, but continued:\r\n\r\n\"On the very summit of yonder peak, which seems to rise at least a\r\nthousand feet above its neighbors, and where the sun shone the warmest,\r\nthe grains and fruits were most luxuriant, and the deer larger and\r\ntamer than in any other place, lived an old man, the chief of all the\r\ntribes that lived between the mountains and the great ocean in the far\r\nwest. The oldest men amongst the Indians could not remember when he\r\nwas young, and their great-grandfathers had told them that he was old\r\nwhen they were children. His beard was like silver, and his face bore\r\nthe marks of that wisdom which can only come with age, yet his form was\r\nnot bent, and his eyes were as strong as the eagle's, that soars up and\r\nlooks in the face of the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful man!\" said Gus.\r\n\r\n\"He was indeed wonderful, and the wisest man upon the earth; he knew\r\nall secrets of the land, and sea, and air, and from them he had gained\r\nthe elixir that still kept the blood warm in his veins after the lapse\r\nof centuries, but he could not get from them contentment,--his soul at\r\nlast wearied of the habit of clay it had worn so long, and he began\r\na search for one worthy to be the inheritor of his wisdom, and the\r\nsuccessor of his power, that he might lie down and be at rest.\r\n\r\n\"He found one at length, but not among the young men of his tribe,\r\namong whom he sought long and patiently. The strength of mind, the\r\npurity of soul he desired, were found only in the person of a lovely\r\ngirl, the daughter of one of the bravest warriors of the mountains. To\r\nher he gave the elixir of life, and instructed her in all the secrets\r\nhe had gained. Lastly, he took off the robe he wore, and putting it\r\nupon her, led her out of the wigwam and declared her a priestess before\r\nall the people. Soon after the great magician became a decrepit old\r\nman, the weight of his years came upon him and he died, and his body\r\nwas laid upon a burning pile and consumed to ashes, while all the\r\npeople mourned around it. Then the priestess went to her wigwam on the\r\nhigh mountains and sat down and thought of the last words the dead man\r\nhad said to her, 'Beware of him who reigneth at the northernmost part\r\nof the earth, for if thou showest weakness or any human passion he will\r\nhave dominion over thee and all thy people.' But years passed on and\r\nno human feeling agitated her. She lived alone communing with spirits,\r\nand at sundry times appearing among the people to astonish them by her\r\nwisdom which as years advanced, become a thousand times more potent\r\nthan had been that of the old magician. And as her wisdom increased so\r\nalso did her beauty. Spirits came and took the ebony from her hair, and\r\ncovered it with gold; they brought blue from the skies and prisoned\r\nit in her eyes; the white stars laid their light upon her face, and\r\nsunbeams rendered her smile so warm and tender that it gladdened all\r\nupon whom it fell.\r\n\r\n\"As I have said, she was troubled by no human feeling; but alas! she\r\ninspired what she did not feel, for all the young braves worshipped\r\nher, not only as a priestess, but as a peerless maiden, and all their\r\nawe could not destroy their love. As she knew every thing, she was of\r\ncourse aware of their silent devotion, but she laughed in the solitude\r\nof her wigwam, and sang:\r\n\r\n\r\n     'Alstarnah must no passion own,\r\n     That mortal e'er before hath known.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And this she would sing over and over to herself, that she might keep\r\nthe words of the magician in mind. But after the lapse of many years,\r\nshe one day ceased to sing, for Alstarnah felt the most powerful of all\r\nhuman passions--she loved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of that!\" ejaculated Gus, \"just paid her out for keeping up\r\nthat monotonous drone so long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! don't interrupt!\" cried Aggie, impatiently, \"who did she love,\r\nGuy?\"\r\n\r\n\"The young chief, Gervassen, who had come many thousand miles from the\r\nburning plains of the far south, to behold the renowned priestess of\r\nthe mountains. As Alstarnah excelled all women in beauty and wisdom, so\r\ndid he all men in beauty and strength. He was as tall and slender as\r\nthe mountain pine, and his face was as fair to look upon as the great\r\nstar that hung above the North King's palace. He came to the mountains\r\nwith great pomp, for a thousand of his enemies pursued him, and he slew\r\nthem all with the masses of rock that he hurled down upon them. See,\r\nthere they lie now like mighty castles in ruins.\r\n\r\n\"When the priestess, Alstarnah, saw this man she thought no more of the\r\nmagician's words or of her own power, but gloried in the beauty that\r\nhad been given her, and said, 'He will surely love me, for there is not\r\nupon all the earth a woman as fair.'\r\n\r\n\"And her words were true, Gervassen did love her, and more bold than\r\nall the rest, entreated her to be his wife. With great joy she placed\r\nher hand in his, but at the moment she was about to speak, she felt an\r\nicy wind blow over her and a voice exclaim: 'Beware of the King of the\r\nNorth! Pity thy people!'\r\n\r\n\"She fled to her wigwam in terror, and for days refused to admit the\r\nchieftain, who stood without pleading for an answer but at length she\r\nventured to glance at him through a tiny hole in the buffalo hide that\r\nformed the walls of her tent, and in an instant all her love for her\r\npeople and all fear of the warning voice vanished, and she promised to\r\nbe Gervassen's bride.\r\n\r\n\"Again came the icy wind and the voice, but so infatuated was she that\r\nthey failed to turn her from her purpose, although her lover asked\r\nthe meaning of them. She trembled as she told him that years before\r\nthere had been a tremendous battle waged between the King of the North\r\nand the forces of the great magician. That the latter had finally\r\ntriumphed, after a terrible struggle, and after yielding one important\r\npoint to his enemy, which was, that if the magician or any of his\r\nsuccessors yielded to human passion, the help of the spirits should be\r\nwithdrawn from them, and their dominion and people left to the power of\r\nthe terrible North King.\r\n\r\n\"'It cannot be that he exists,' returned the warrior, 'else he would\r\nhave endeavored to enter the land over which my tribe is scattered, and\r\nnever, never has one of his subjects been seen or heard of upon it.'\r\n\r\n\"In spite of all her wisdom, this reasoning of Gervassen convinced\r\nAlstarnah, who soon after stood up before all the people and bade them\r\nfarewell, saying that she was going to dwell in the wigwam of the\r\nmighty chieftain, Gervassen.\r\n\r\n\"Then she took her lover's hand and began the descent of the charmed\r\nmountain, followed by all her people, who were weeping and wailing,\r\nand entreating that she would come back to them. But still she went\r\non, but only slowly, because of the great press of people around her;\r\nand suddenly an icy wind passed over them, and all fell to the earth\r\nshivering and terror-stricken, for they had never felt cold before,\r\nand they looked up to the mountain, and lo! upon the very summit, at\r\nthe door of the deserted wigwam, stood a terrible figure, clothed in\r\nwhite, and having a face as white as his robes, and his hair was like\r\nthe long crystals that hang from the roofs of caves that the water goes\r\nthrough, and his eyes were like two great diamonds, white, yet blazing\r\nlike the sun. Over his head he waved a sceptre, and as fast as he\r\nwaved, great flakes of whiteness came out of the clouds and covered all\r\nthe mountain tops, and came nearer and nearer to the frightened people.\r\n\r\n\"'It is the terrible North King,' they cried. 'See, he is throwing his\r\narrows upon us.'\r\n\r\n\"'I will return,' cried Alstarnah, filled with remorse. 'I will return\r\nand save my people.'\r\n\r\n\"But once more she heard the voice as it wailed 'Too late! too late!'\r\nand the icy wind came and arrested her returning footsteps, for it\r\nchilled her to ice by the side of Gervassen, for whom she had dared so\r\nmuch. Then he and all the people were filled with still greater terror\r\nand turned to flee down the mountains, but the snow flakes--the deadly\r\narrows of the North King, came faster and faster, falling before as\r\nwell as behind them, clogging the feet and chilling the life-blood of\r\nthe people Alstarnah had betrayed.\r\n\r\n\"First, Gervassen fell, almost at the side of Alstarnah: then, one by\r\none, all the rest of the people sank down and were buried by the soft,\r\nwhite snow, until at last not one remained to tell of the verdure that\r\nonce crowned the mountains where the North King still reigns, or of the\r\npeople he slew with terrible arrows of snow, like those he still loves\r\nto throw in derision upon any daring traveler that attempts to invade\r\nhis dominions.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that is the story of the first Snow Storm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what, Guy,\" commented George, \"You won't tell stories\r\nabout facts, I know, but you make up for it when you have fancies to\r\ndeal with.\"\r\n\r\nGuy laughed, saying, \"He supposed there was no harm in that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd little Aggie said, as she bade him good-night, \"I guess you will\r\nbe forgiven even if there is, Guy. And I am sure I shall never look at\r\nthese mountains or see snow again without thinking of your story.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor some time Aggie found no difficulty in keeping her word, for the\r\ntrain were obliged to pass over a part of the Rocky Mountains, and many\r\na strange adventure they met upon the way. Those that had been over\r\nthe route before said they got along remarkably well, while those to\r\nwhom the experience was new, declared that with the breaking down of\r\nsome wagons, the unloading of others, and letting them and goods they\r\ncontained down the precipices by ropes, and the accidents attendant\r\nupon such work, they found the journey anything but delightful. The\r\nchildren enjoyed this part of the trip more than any other, for, with\r\nthe exception of Guy, they had no more work to do, and had much more\r\nto interest and amuse them.\r\n\r\nBut upon the whole they were rather glad when they got upon the level\r\nground again, and especially so when they neared the shores of the\r\ngreat Salt Lake, and passed by the city that stands upon its shores.\r\n\r\nMr. Harwood had intended to visit it, and spend three or four days in\r\nlooking about the city and endeavoring to learn something about the\r\nmanners and customs of the people that inhabited it, but several of\r\nthe party were anxious to reach their destination, and for that and\r\nmany other reasons they passed the dwelling place of the Mormons by.\r\nAlthough the children were greatly disappointed at not being able to go\r\ninto the city, they could not help speaking and thinking with delight\r\nof the beautiful country they had passed over to reach it.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said Aggie one day when they stopped to rest, \"that\r\nfour seasons had wandered out of some years and lost themselves up\r\namong those mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're crazy!\" said George contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" said Guy kindly, \"but what could have put such a queer\r\nidea as that into your head, Aggie?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why you know,\" she said, \"the grass was fresh and green there as\r\nif it was spring time, and yet very often while you were gathering\r\nbuttercups to make me a chain, George and Gus would be pelting you with\r\nsnow-balls, while the summer sun was shining upon us all the day long.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" exclaimed George, \"I should never have thought of it\r\nagain. It's the queerest place I ever saw in my life, except this very\r\ngreat valley which we are in now. Papa says it is over three hundred\r\nmiles from the Rocky Mountains to the Sierra Nevadas, yet although we\r\nhaven't been out of sight of the first for more than a week, we shall\r\nsee the tops of the others in a few days, and then, hurrah! we've only\r\nto cross them and we shall be in California! Won't that be glorious?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I shall be glad,\" said Aggie, \"for I was beginning to think as\r\nmamma said the other day, 'that we never should see a house again.'\r\nAnd won't you be glad, Guy, not to have to get up so early to make the\r\nfires in the morning, and to work so late at night, often after walking\r\nover the hot sands all day?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Guy rather sadly, \"You have all been very kind to\r\nme here, and though I have often worked very hard, I guess it won't be\r\nall play for _me_ in California.\"\r\n\r\nLittle Aggie often thought of these words of Guy in the days that\r\nfollowed, as they drew nearer and nearer their destination, and each\r\nmember of the company spoke of his or her hopes or prospects. She\r\nnoticed that upon that Guy, as well as his mother, was always silent,\r\nand many, many hours she sat in the wagon puzzling her little head as\r\nto what would become of their favorite.\r\n\r\nShe even spoke of it to Guy when they were alone together, but he\r\nseldom would say anything about it. He was not like some people that\r\nfind comfort in talking over perplexing questions, and it certainly was\r\na very perplexing question to him, how he was to support his mother in\r\nthe strange country to which he had induced her to come, for though\r\nyoung, Guy was too wise to think that gold lay all over the land, and\r\nall that any one had to do was to stoop and pick it up, though many\r\nolder than himself in the train still believed that old fable, which\r\ndeceived many in the time of Cortez, over two hundred years before.\r\n\r\nBut although Guy was so uncertain as to what his fate would be in\r\nCalifornia, he soon became as anxious to reach it as the rest, for\r\nnothing for many weeks occurred to break the monotony of their journey,\r\nand the only excitement they had at all was in looking out for Indians,\r\nwhich were said to be very plenty upon their route, and in being\r\nconstantly pleasurably disappointed in not coming upon any.\r\n\r\nOne day, indeed, they were greatly surprised by the descent of\r\na terrific rain storm upon them, for they had never dreamed of\r\nencountering rain in that elevated region, where not even a drop of\r\ndew was found in the early morning. At the time it occurred a party\r\nfrom the train, among whom was Guy, were out hunting. They saw the\r\nblack clouds rising above the mountains, but leisurely continued their\r\nway intent upon obtaining some game for supper, when, suddenly, a blast\r\nof wind swept down upon them, bringing with it torrents of water, as\r\nif, as Guy afterwards said, another deluge had come to sweep every\r\nliving thing from the earth's surface.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the horses stood still as if stunned, and their riders\r\nbent low over the saddles, then, suddenly wheeling, the animals turned\r\ntheir heads away from the furious blast, and in that position waited\r\nfor it to expend its fury. Neither whip nor spur would induce them to\r\nmove, though Mr. Harwood used both freely, being anxious to gain the\r\ncamp and satisfy himself of the safety of his family. The horses chose\r\nthe best position, according to the instinct which had been given them\r\nto escape from danger, and they maintained it until the fury of the\r\nstorm was spent, and then obediently carried their riders to the camp,\r\nwhere they found two or three of the lighter wagons blown over, and a\r\nnumber of articles scattered hither and thither. All the people however\r\nwere safe though greatly frightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs George said, the great rain storm seemed to have come expressly\r\nto wash all interest out of their journey, for from that day until\r\ntheir arrival within sight of Carson River, within the Territory of\r\nNevada, where a part of the company were to part from the main body,\r\nthey saw but little to interest them. True they had passed over a\r\nwonderful country, but the alkali plains seemed small in comparison to\r\nthe desert, over which they had passed some weeks before, and all the\r\ngrandeur of the Sierra Nevada Mountains could not awaken in them one\r\niota of the enthusiasm with which they had greeted the first glimpse\r\nof the snow-capped summits of the Rocky Mountains. In fact they were\r\ntoo weary of their long journey to look around them for enjoyment, but\r\nrather looked forward to it, when all deserts of alkali, of sand and\r\nsage-brush being past, they might by the rivers and in the peaceful\r\nvales of California find rest and plenty.\r\n\r\nAs I have said before, all in the company but Guy and his mother had\r\nsomething to look forward to. Many of the young men were going to the\r\nplacer diggings or the deep mines, and spoke exultantly of the rich\r\nharvest they would surely glean. Mr. Graham had a quartz mill in a\r\nvery fine situation, and he was going to take charge of it, and his\r\nsisters were to keep house for him, while Mr. Frazer and Mr. Harwood\r\nhad decided to purchase farms and settle upon them.\r\n\r\nThe last night that all in the train were to encamp together, a large\r\nfire was built and all gathered around it to talk over their plans.\r\nGuy sat by Aggie's side and tried to talk to her, but he could not help\r\nlistening to what was said, and that, with the knowledge that they were\r\nso near California--their journey's end,--made him feel so miserable\r\nthat he walked away from the fire, and hid himself in a dark place, and\r\ncried as if his heart would break.\r\n\r\nWhat was he to do when compelled to leave these friends? Almost\r\npenniless where was he in that new, unsettled country to find a home\r\nfor his mother. For himself he could provide, but what should he do\r\nfor his mother? He had heard that work, hard work, was plenty; but his\r\nmother could not do hard work; it had nearly killed her before, and\r\ndoubtless there were few children to be taught. What could he do with\r\nher? Where should he leave her, while he went to try his fortune?\r\n\r\nIt never entered his head to ask any one to give her a home. He felt\r\nunder unpayable obligations already to Mr. Harwood for bringing them so\r\nfar upon their way, and treating them so kindly, therefore to ask him\r\nto do more, he thought would be the greatest presumption, so instead of\r\nasking help of any man, he asked it of God.\r\n\r\nHe was still sitting with his head bowed on his knees, and the tears\r\nstreaming down his cheeks, most earnestly praying, when, suddenly,\r\na flash from the light of a lantern passed over him, and a voice\r\nexclaimed: \"why, here you are, I have been searching for you for ever\r\nso long.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of the young men from St. Louis, with whom Guy had been on\r\nmost excellent terms ever since they left W----.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is I,\" he returned, rather reluctantly, for he was ashamed\r\nthat he should have found him crying. \"What is the matter, John?\" he\r\npresently added.\r\n\r\n\"The matter! why, don't you know we are to break up camp to-morrow, and\r\none party go one way into California, and the other another! Now, which\r\none are you going with, Guy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" he said, with difficulty repressing a sob, \"one part of\r\nCalifornia is the same to me as another. I have no friends there, and,\r\noh dear, I very much fear I ought not to have come at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't say that,\" exclaimed John, cheerfully, \"you just come along\r\nwith me and my partners, we are going straight to the placer diggings,\r\nand we'll take care of you until you can do for yourself, which won't\r\nbe long, you may be sure; I shouldn't wonder if you're as rich as\r\nRothschild in a few years.\"\r\n\r\nGuy's eyes sparkled, but in a moment his countenance fell, and he\r\nfaltered out,--\r\n\r\n\"But what is to become of mother,--I couldn't leave her alone in a\r\nstrange country, her heart would break.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure enough, I never thought of her, but something might be done, she\r\nwouldn't break her heart, if she didn't starve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but she might do both!\" exclaimed Guy. \"Indeed, I cannot leave\r\nher. We must live and strive together, John. I thank you for your\r\noffer, but I can't leave my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a nobler fellow than the Spartan that let the wolf gnaw his\r\nvitals rather than cry out,\" replied the young man, \"and though\r\nyou won't join us, Guy, I don't doubt but you'll find good fortune\r\nsomewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Guy, and comforted by the young man's kind offer,\r\nthough he could not accept it, he walked back to the fire, where he\r\nfound only the Grahams and the Harwoods.\r\n\r\n\"We have been talking about you, Guy,\" said Mr. Harwood. \"Mr. Graham\r\nsays he will give you a place in the mill if you will go with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will, sir!\" cried Guy, joyfully, his heart bounding, then\r\nfalling like lead as he added, \"but my mother?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think she will consent,\" said Mr. Graham.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir, it was not of that I was thinking, it was of what would\r\nbecome of her. Oh, sir, she is poor and friendless, and I couldn't\r\nthink of leaving her alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say then,\" said George, who had apparently been engaged in building\r\ncastles in the air, or anything else rather than listening to the\r\nconversation, \"I say, now that Guy isn't going with Mr. Graham, it's\r\ncold enough up there to kill his mother, make an icicle of her before\r\nChristmas, you know you said last night it was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that true, sir?\" asked Guy, turning to Mr. Graham.\r\n\r\n\"Why, I can't say that your mother would be an icicle before\r\nChristmas,\" returned Mr. Graham, laughing, \"but it certainly is far too\r\ncold and stormy there for a delicate woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, then, sir!\" returned Guy, very sadly, \"I cannot go with you, I\r\ncannot leave my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried George, turning a double somersault before the fire,\r\nand nearly into it.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Guy, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it means,\" said Mr. Harwood, \"that if you will not leave your\r\nmother, you must stay with us, as she has consented to do. Much as I\r\ndisliked to part with you, who have been so invaluable to me on the\r\nway, I did not like to ask you to remain with us while others were\r\nready to offer you, in mines and mills, so much better opportunities of\r\ngaining money than I can upon my little farm. There, for some time at\r\nleast, there will be more work than money, I guess. So now, Guy, you\r\nknow your mother will, at any rate, have a home; Mr. Graham will give\r\nyou much higher wages than I can.\"\r\n\r\nAt that point, Aggie began to cry bitterly, saying, \"Guy, you mustn't\r\ngo away! who should I have to tell me stories?\"\r\n\r\n\"And, besides, my dog Jack can't smoke yet,\" interrupted Gus, \"and you\r\npromised to teach him, and you've got to stay and do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said George. \"I expect I shall burn the house down trying\r\nto smoke, if you don't. You see I haven't forgotten how you threw that\r\nflour and water on me in the burning wagon, yet, and you have to stay\r\nand let me have satisfaction for that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, do stay,\" said Aggie, coaxingly.\r\n\r\n\"I intend to,\" cried Guy, bursting out into a loud laugh to prevent\r\nhimself from crying with joy at his good fortune. \"Hasn't it nearly\r\nbroken my heart to think of leaving you, Aggie, and Mr. and Mrs.\r\nHarwood, and all the rest? Indeed, I would rather be with you all, if\r\nyou were as poor as--as--\"\r\n\r\n\"Job's turkey,\" suggested George.\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, or as I am myself, than be a prince without you.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which burst of eloquence Guy sat down, bringing a scream of\r\ndismay from Aggie, upon whom he had inadvertently seated himself.\r\n\r\n\"Now that is all settled,\" said Mr. Harwood, dismissing the matter in\r\nhis usual cool way, though one could see he was much gratified, \"we\r\nwill have prayers.\"\r\n\r\nHe arose and rung the large bell and all the company gathered around\r\nhim, as they had often done upon the plains and the mountains, and\r\nlistened to the word of God. Then he spoke to them of what had passed,\r\nand gave his best wishes to each. All were much affected at his kindly\r\nwords, and by the short prayer that followed. There were few dry eyes\r\nthere as those that were to leave on the morrow bade farewell, and it\r\nwas with deep grief Guy parted with his many friends.\r\n\r\nAt daybreak next morning the final separation took place, a long train\r\nof waggons diverged to another path, leaving the families of Mr.\r\nFrazer and Mr. Harwood to take their way alone into California.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA month later they were there, and not only there but settled upon\r\nfine farms adjoining each other. To be sure they had but very small\r\ndwellings to live in, but all were too much pleased with the green\r\nmeadows, sloping down to the river's edge, and the beautiful forests\r\nthat crowned the hills that lay in the background, to fret because the\r\nwalls of their house were made of sun-dried mud instead of stone. They\r\nfound too many things to be thankful for, to find time to complain of\r\nany, and although all things were very rough, and Mrs. Harwood and\r\nMrs. Loring wondered a hundred times a day \"what they should do,\" they\r\nfinally decided, when everything in the little house was arranged to\r\ntheir satisfaction, that they should do very well indeed.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, very well,\" said Mrs. Loring, for although she called herself a\r\nservant, and was paid as such, she did not feel degraded by it, for she\r\nknew she was earning an honest living, and was respected as a friend\r\nby her employers, while Guy was looked upon almost as a son. He took\r\nthe same place with the children as that held in their trip across the\r\nplains. He worked for their father, and for them, and very hard too,\r\nsometimes, but he was still their playfellow, George's guide, Gus'\r\nfriend, little Aggie's comforter, and singer of songs, and teller of\r\nstories to all. As I have said, he worked hard, for even with a kind,\r\nindulgent master, like Mr. Harwood, much is thrown upon the hands of\r\na willing boy, so Guy found there was still fires to light in the\r\nmorning, water to fetch, wood to chop and carry, cows to milk, and the\r\nplough to be followed.\r\n\r\nSometimes he grew tired of the dull routine, and would wish himself\r\nat the diggings with the young men from St. Louis, and then with Mr.\r\nGraham, at the mill, but a glance at his mother, working over the hot\r\nstove, or washing at the spring, would render him content, for he would\r\nsay, \"She is happy with all her toil, while I am near, and shall I\r\nworry over a little extra work, when it keeps me with her?\" And then\r\naway to his work he would go with renewed energy, and sometimes Mr.\r\nHarwood would give him a holiday which would quite revive his drooping\r\nspirits, and make him strong for weeks.\r\n\r\nOh, what holidays these were! Off all the children would go to the\r\nwoods, that in the afternoon were full of sunshine, so warm, so\r\nbeautiful; the grass would look like shaded velvet beneath them, and\r\nthe leaves would glance and quiver as if they were fairies frolicking\r\nin their best clothes. And such woods as these were, in which to gather\r\nwild plums and nuts, and then to lie in the shade and tell fairy\r\nstories. \"The very trees seem to say them over to us,\" said Aggie, the\r\nfirst day they spent in the woods together. \"I am sure there must be\r\nsomething in all these sweet sounds we hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Birds' songs,\" said George, contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Aggie, \"something more. Tell us what it is, Guy, you can\r\nalways tell what the birds and animals say, you even told us what the\r\nprairie dogs said, you know.\"\r\n\r\nGuy threw himself down on the green grass beside a little brook, and\r\nlistened, with his eyes fixed on the yellow sands of the little stream.\r\n\r\n\"The birds are telling me that there is gold in that sand,\" he said\r\nat length, \"they tell me there is gold throughout all this wonderful\r\ncountry, in every rock and chasm, and there is one big fellow that is\r\ntelling me how it all came there. Shall I repeat it over to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" cried Aggie, in great glee.\r\n\r\n\"And let us have no more preliminary fibs,\" said George, \"you are the\r\ngreatest fellow for them, you know, Guy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, p'shaw!\" ejaculated Gus, impatient, \"Let him go ahead!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's just what the birds say,\" replied Guy, throwing himself back\r\non the grass, and smiling gravely. \"That big fellow on the bough there\r\ntells me he is delighted; that he has at last found one that can\r\nunderstand his language, for he has heard so many ridiculous theories\r\nadvanced by men with picks on their shoulders and books in their hands,\r\nas to what gold is, and how it came on the ground, that he has nearly\r\nburst his throat in trying to make them understand the truth, and has\r\nthen been accused of making a 'senseless chatter.'\"\r\n\r\n\"'And all the time,' says he, 'their chatter was far more senseless\r\nthan mine, and so they would think if they had heard all of us laugh\r\nover their conjectures about a matter we knew all about, for birds have\r\nlegends as well as men, and there's none better remembered than that of\r\nthe \"Enchanted Yellow Men.\"'\r\n\r\n\"Thousands of years ago they inhabited the finest portions of this\r\nland. They hunted the deer on a hundred hills, and bathed in all the\r\nstreams of the mountains. Their tents were in every valley, and the\r\ntracks of their feet on every path. They were the most numerous and\r\npowerful people on all the earth, yet none could tell why they were\r\nfeared, for they had never battled with their neighbors, or shown\r\ngreat courage in the chase. In reality, it was their color alone that\r\ninspired awe. They were of the hue of the sun at midday, and their long\r\nhair streamed upon the wind like the dead leaves of corn in autumn.\r\nFrom toe to crown they were pure, bright yellow,--as yellow as the\r\nbuttercups in yonder field.\r\n\r\n\"Ever were they looked upon with awe by their tawny brethren, who\r\nthought that the great Spirit had set the seal of his special love\r\nupon them, and had sent them forth as his chosen people. The yellow\r\nmen believed the same, for everything they undertook, prospered. None\r\nof the surrounding tribes ever showed opposition to them. They could\r\nfollow the game over any ground, and spear the fish in any stream they\r\nchose, so that hunger never entered their wigwams; and in course of\r\ntime they became so puffed up with their good fortune that they called\r\nthemselves 'gods,' and the neighboring tribes bowed and worshipped them.\r\n\r\n\"Then the Great Spirit, who, from his home in the great mountains, had\r\nbeen watching their doings, grew very angry and threatened to destroy\r\nthem all. But they were so beautiful to look upon, that he decided to\r\ntry them once more and see if any good remained in them. Shortly after\r\nthis a mighty tribe on the west of the yellow men, crossed over to the\r\neast, and took from a small, weak tribe that dwelt there all their\r\nlands, and drove them up to the barren mountains, where they could not\r\nfind even so much as a herb to eat.\r\n\r\n\"But they were very near the Great Spirit, and he heard all their woes,\r\nand he sent a messenger down to the yellow men bidding them arise, slay\r\nthe invaders and restore the destitute to their homes again. But they\r\nwould not, and all those upon the mountains died, and their curses came\r\ndown, and rested upon the rich and powerful who had refused to help\r\nthem, and upon the day that the last of the wanderers perished a voice\r\nwas heard in the tents of the yellow men, and it said, 'As ye refused\r\nto leave your lands to aid your brethren, ye shall rest in the ground\r\ntill strangers shall bear thee hence, and as ye have refused to toil,\r\nor bless in your life time, ye shall do both after death. Ye shall buy\r\nfood for the poor, but yet shall the curses of the Great Spirit follow\r\nye.'\r\n\r\n\"And even as they listened to these terrible words, flames burst out\r\nof the mountains, and rushed over the valleys and plains. As it passed\r\nover them each was burnt to a shapeless mass. In thousands of places\r\nthe earth opened and they sank into their graves. And there the yellow\r\nmen, in their new forms, waited for thousands of years, and there many\r\nof them are waiting still for the pick of the miner to bring them forth\r\ninto their new life, to curse the wicked and improvident, and to bless\r\nthe poor and needy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There! there! the bird has flown away!\" said Aggie.\r\n\r\n\"But he has answered the question that has been puzzling my head for a\r\nlong, long time,\" said Guy. \"And told us, too, that none of us should\r\nbe inactive and the greater our power to help others the more we should\r\nexercise it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's so,\" said George, \"and I suppose we are all like the 'yellow\r\nmen,' a good deal puffed up with our own conceit. I'll tell you what,\r\nsuppose we all enter into a contract to do all the good we can, and let\r\nGuy be the judge of our actions, for after all he is the one that first\r\nput it into my head to do _any_ good, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" cried Aggie, while Gus said, \"It was a jolly good idea.\" But\r\nGuy demurred about being judge, thinking with a good deal of shame\r\nthat he was sometimes as inactive in a good cause as the \"yellow men\"\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nSo they sat in the woods talking the matter over until the last rays of\r\nthe sun fell through the thick leaves and warned them home. Then they\r\ntook their baskets and turned their faces homeward. Guy saying, \"Well\r\nthen, we are agreed all of us to begin the lives now, to which the\r\n'yellow men' were doomed for their idleness and presumption. Henceforth\r\nwe are to help the weak, oppose the proud and wicked, and strive to do\r\ngood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will for one,\" said George, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"So will I,\" echoed Gus.\r\n\r\n\"And so will I, with all my heart!\" exclaimed little Aggie, just as\r\nthey stepped out of the woods into the open field. \"Only look,\" she\r\nadded, glancing back, \"a bird has followed us out of the woods. I do\r\nbelieve it is the one that told us the pretty story,--and, listen, to\r\nwhat he is singing, 'Good bye!' why, I even can interpret that, 'Good\r\nboy! good bye! Guy Loring! Guy, Good bye!'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n+-------------------------------------------------+\r\n|Transcriber's note:                              |\r\n|                                                 |\r\n|Obvious typographic errors have been corrected.  |\r\n|                                                 |\r\n+-------------------------------------------------+",
