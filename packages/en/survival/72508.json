S. King.\r\n\r\n  BOSTON, U.S.A.:\r\n\r\n  D. C. HEATH & CO., PUBLISHERS.\r\n\r\n  1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  COPYRIGHT, 1891,\r\n  BY D. C. HEATH & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TYPOGRAPHY BY J. S. CUSHING & CO., BOSTON, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n  PRESSWORK BY BERWICK & SMITH, BOSTON, U.S.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSays Cicero: “There is nothing so charming as the knowledge of that\r\nbranch of literature which enables us to discover the immensity of\r\nnature, the heavens, the earth, and the seas; this is the branch which\r\nhas taught us religion, moderation, and magnanimity, and has rescued\r\nthe soul from obscurity to make us see all things above, below, and\r\nbetween both.”\r\n\r\nSuch literature as this is now markedly in the ascendant. Natural\r\nscience seems to be pre-eminently the coming pursuit of the coming man,\r\nand natural science has been wonderfully popularized in books suited\r\nto those who without expecting to be specialists desire to be well\r\ninformed and to look understandingly at the world which lies about them.\r\n\r\nSeveral decades have gone by since Michelet, with his marvellous books,\r\n“The Bird” and “The Insect,” and Hugh Miller, chaste, graphic, and\r\nenthusiastic in his “Old Red Sandstone,” “The Cruise of the Betsy,”\r\nand “The Testimony of the Rocks,” opened glorious new worlds before a\r\nrising generation. That generation is now doing good work under the\r\ninspiration of the impetus then received. Our library shelves are\r\nto-day affluent in books that are handmaids of natural science. Tait\r\nand Balfour Stewart in their “Unseen Universe” have brought marvels\r\nof world-building within range of our narrower ken. Argyle in his\r\n“Unity of Nature” and “Reign of Law” and “Primeval Man,” interpreted\r\nmighty and far-reaching harmonies. Principal Sir William Dawson, in\r\nhis “Story of the Earth and Man,” brings the successive geologic\r\nages before us with the vividness of some master-painter. Darwin and\r\nHuxley, detailing experiments, have not scorned to come within the\r\nreach of the unlearned mind. In botany, the pleasing, enthusiastic,\r\nif often erroneous generalizations, of Grant Allen have their use and\r\nplace beside the stronger works of Cooke, Gray, Jaegar, Taylor, and\r\nothers. Our Gray, taking a leading rank among systematic botanists,\r\ndid not disdain to write for children “How Plants Grow.” No man has\r\ndone more toward popularizing natural science than Rev. J. G. Wood in\r\nhis numerous works. Kingsley, with his exquisite English, has given us\r\n“Town Geology,” and Tyndale has told us of “Forms of Water.” Buckland\r\nand Gosse have written what young and old have rejoiced to read. The\r\nelders have sat down with the juniors to revel in Arabella Buckley’s\r\n“Fairy-Land of Science” and “Life and Her Children,” while Camille\r\nFlammarion has made doubly eloquent to us the midnight skies. It\r\nseems almost invidious to name a few out of the many authors who have\r\nwritten not merely technical books for study, but popular works on\r\nnatural science, to be read on sea-shore and road-side, on a bench in\r\nthe garden, or lying under orchard trees, or sitting in the woods with\r\na brook purling at our feet. McCook has made many insects our daily\r\nfriends and teachers. Thompson, Mrs. Treat, and Olive T. Miller have\r\nmade the birds not only the guests of our maples, but of our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe parent and teacher need no longer complain that they cannot find\r\nthe information clearly given needed for replies to multitudinous\r\nhourly “whys” and “hows”: the present age is prodigal to its children.\r\n\r\nThe Nature Readers have been written to direct the minds of our youth\r\nin their first studies to the pleasant ways of Natural Science. Their\r\nmain object has been to cultivate the faculty of observation, awaken\r\nenthusiasm, and direct taste in noble lines.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is designed to open the way for severer studies in\r\ngeology, astronomy, and biology.\r\n\r\n                                           THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Science is so placed in the fore-front of the studies of the\r\npresent age that no apology is needed for pressing it upon the schools.\r\nTo object to this pursuit is simply to write oneself a laggard behind\r\nthe times. We can do little that is better for our children than to\r\nteach them that the world is law-full to the core.\r\n\r\nTwo methods of study are ardently advocated by those who\r\ninstruct in natural science. The one demands practical personal\r\ninvestigation,--nothing but investigation,--deprecates the use of\r\ntext-books, and insists upon the object only. Another, perhaps a lazier\r\nfashion, is to ignore the object and relegate the pupil only to the\r\ntext-books.\r\n\r\nBut _in medio tutissimus ibis_ holds here. The child should indeed\r\nobserve, and, if it can, discover; but let us by no means deprive it of\r\nthe inheritance of the ages.\r\n\r\nWhy should we set the fortunate child of the nineteenth century in the\r\ncondition of the child of the first or fourteenth centuries? Let us\r\ngive the pupil the benefit of the best that has been discovered and\r\ndetailed.\r\n\r\nAnd what benefit shall he derive from such study? Let us quote from\r\nthe Report of the British Royal Education Committee: “If the object of\r\neducation is the fitting of pupils for those duties they will be called\r\non to perform, then instruction in science is second only in importance\r\nto instruction in reading, writing, and arithmetic. No subject is\r\nbetter calculated to awaken the interest and intelligence of pupils\r\nthan the study of Natural Science.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LESSON                                                   PAGE\r\n\r\n        I.

Among\r\nthe splendid orbs which roll in space, earth is but one, and it shines\r\nwith pale and borrowed light. Unnumbered systems moved upon their\r\ncourses before our globe was lighted by the sun. But, for us who live\r\nupon the earth the history of the Universe opens with this small\r\nplanet, a part of which we see and know.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us, when we begin to inquire about our earth-home, that it\r\nmust always have been a complete and finished world, just as it now is.\r\nScience denies this. Geology leads us far back, before time began to be\r\nreckoned here, and shows us some of the processes of world-building.\r\nTime was when this firm, beautiful, and life-filled earth was a vast\r\nsphere of gas, destitute of all its present order, and without germs of\r\nlife. As the palace or the temple rises into beauty and harmony out of\r\nvast masses of material, such as wood, stone, brick, mortar, iron, and\r\ncourse after course is laid up in the building according to a definite\r\npattern, so along the process of earth-building, force and matter,\r\npower and material, have been laying up the courses of the earth upon a\r\nuniform plan.\r\n\r\nAnd is the earth now finished? That we cannot say; there may be many\r\nmore astonishing changes yet in store for it. We are now apt to call\r\nit the “solid earth,” because those parts of it with which we are\r\nacquainted, the soil and the rocks, are the most solid things that we\r\nknow; but in plain fact the earth may still be partly liquid, with the\r\nexception of a comparatively thin crust. The distance through this\r\nball, our earth, is nearly eight thousand miles, and the surface, or\r\ncrust, is perhaps nowhere over a hundred miles thick. Thus we might\r\ntypify the world[1] by a metal ball, having a thin shell of solid\r\nmetal, and filled with melted metal. But as this crust, thin as it is\r\nin comparison, has for many thousand years proved thick enough and\r\nsafe enough for a dwelling-place for men, I think we need not feel any\r\nanxiety because it is not thicker.\r\n\r\nTo read the story of this earth-building, it has been necessary for\r\nscience to begin at the end; that is, at the present time, which is\r\nthe last chapter of the story. With long and patient care wise men\r\nhave read back, page by page, the earth-building story; we cannot say\r\nto its beginning, but as far back as science has yet been able to go.\r\nNow we are able to take up the narrative at such beginning as has thus\r\nfar been found, and read it forward to our present day like a plain\r\nstory. Will this be interesting? It seems to me that it is like some\r\nmagnificent fairy tale, more marvellous than the story of Aladdin’s\r\nLamp, or Sinbad the Sailor, or The Caliph of Bagdad. The nights of\r\nArabian story were not half so full of wonders as the days and nights,\r\nthe vast periods, of geologic story.\r\n\r\nOur earth is a globe in rapid motion. The motion is dual, i.e., double;\r\nit rolls over and over upon its axis as you might spin a ball round on\r\na knitting-needle thrust through its centre; but the ball on the needle\r\nwould stay in its place, no matter how many times it whirled over. The\r\nearth, as it whirls, rolls along a great path. Every time it turns over\r\nit measures off on this path a distance equal to its own circumference,\r\nbut at the same time it sweeps on with the motion of the whole system,\r\nso that each day it travels over a million and a half of miles. The\r\nearth’s path is not in a straight line; it is nearly circular; it is\r\nwhat is called elliptical, or partly egg-shaped. As far back as we\r\ncan trace earth-history, the twofold motion and the globe shape have\r\nbelonged to our planet.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest state of which we can speak, our earth was a globe of\r\ngas at least two thousand times as large as it now is. Science has\r\nmade a guess that, before this, our earth was a ring or layer of vapor\r\naround the sun. This ring, being spun off into space by the rapid\r\nmotion of the sun, took, after a time, the sphere shape, and being held\r\nby the attraction of the sun from wandering farther off into space, has\r\never since whirled around in a great path about its ancient source.\r\nIf this theory be true, then all the other planets of our system were\r\nprobably once cast off in their order by the sun, as vast fiery rings.\r\nThat must have been an age of grand and splendid fireworks indeed! If\r\nonly one had been there to see!\r\n\r\nWhy cannot we imagine that we were there to see? Can we not fancy\r\nourselves back, through all the wonderful ages, until we reach the\r\nbeginning of all things? The Arabians have a kind of fanciful being,\r\nwhom they call an Afrite, or Afreet. They say that this being is formed\r\nof pure heat, smokeless flame. Did any of you ever see, on a very\r\nscorching day, the air quivering above a dry, hot road? That quivering\r\nof hot air is often seen on the desert, and the Arabians say it is the\r\nwaving of an Afrite’s robe. Let us fancy we were Afrites, gigantic\r\nflame-spirits, present when the earth, from a fiery ring, had just\r\nbecome a fiery ball.\r\n\r\nHeat, such as we cannot imagine, is the chief characteristic of our\r\nglobe at this stage. But being Afrites, and ourselves made of heat,\r\nwe shall not mind that. We see that the whirling hot ball has in it\r\nall the atoms which will one day become solid rocks. But these atoms\r\nare kept apart by heat, and are in a state like gas. As we Afrites\r\npeer at the glowing, whirling ball, we see that there are two forces\r\nat work within it. Heat is one force, keeping all particles expanded,\r\nand not letting them come together; but there is another force called\r\ngravitation at work also. This is a force which causes all things\r\nto tend toward each other--to draw together. It is this force of\r\ngravitation which first gives the gaseous ring its globe shape, pulling\r\nits particles together; and as Afrites, we watch with interest the\r\nresults of this force by long and slow degrees condensing the matter of\r\nthe globe.\r\n\r\nWhile this is going on, we perceive that two great changes are taking\r\nplace. First, the sphere is growing cooler, by radiating, or throwing\r\noff its heat. Heat a poker red hot; wave it in the air, and it cools by\r\ngiving off its heat to the air. Thus the hot globe throws off some of\r\nits heat as it whirls along its path in space. But as the sphere cools,\r\nthe loss of heat allows the particles to shrink and come together and\r\nunite with each other. The uniting of some of these various simple\r\nsubstances produces other substances, and as the cooling and uniting go\r\non, the great globe becomes smaller and smaller. As we are Afrites, and\r\nnot afraid of heat, we wander into this fluid ball, and we find that\r\nby all this cooling, condensing, and uniting, the material for future\r\nrocks is forming.\r\n\r\nStill imagining ourselves Afrites, the next change does not please us\r\nas well. We find that the outer particles of vapor in our great hot\r\nball, as they ascend into space and cool, unite with each other and\r\nbecome a vapor like steam, and this steam cools and condenses into rain\r\nand mist. If a plate is held before the nose of a tea-kettle from which\r\nsteam is rushing out, the steam condenses at once into drops of water.\r\nIf the plate with the water-drops on it is set out in sharply cold\r\nwinter air, it is at once covered with frost or ice. Thus it happened\r\nwith the vapor about that hot sphere, our world; and the rain and mist\r\nfell back upon the glowing ball from which they had risen. They helped\r\nto cool it and to increase the hardening, but they were also reheated\r\nand sent off again as vapor, to cool once more in space.\r\n\r\nIf at that time we, as Afrites, had travelled to some other planet, and\r\ntaken a seat there to watch our world from a distance, we should then\r\nhave seen it in its greatest beauty as a heavenly body, because in that\r\nage it was at its greatest size, and was far larger than now: also it\r\nmust have shone as a clear and lovely star, with a glory which has now\r\nalmost passed away.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration at the head of this chapter the large ring\r\nrepresents the earth as a vast ball of hot vapor. The very small ring\r\nin the centre shows the present size of the globe as compared with its\r\nfirst expansion. The circle marked 1 shows the earth as a simple sphere\r\nof vapor, its earliest condition. The circle 2 shows us the stage\r\nwhere, by the force of gravity, and the cooling resulting from the\r\nradiation of heat, the sphere of gas began to have a fluid centre, or\r\ncore. We must understand that the condensing particles in the centre\r\nwere not rendered solid, but fluid, as you may see the molten glass\r\nor iron at a glass-works or iron-foundry. This fluid state probably\r\nstill continues at the centre of the earth. Figure 3 shows us the\r\ncondensation going on. As the globe cools, a solid crust, marked _x_,\r\nis formed around the fluid centre, and between the centre and the crust\r\nthe matter of the globe is hardening, while the outer envelope beyond\r\nthe crust is still gas.\r\n\r\nFigure 4 shows another change. The vapor has cooled and condensed in\r\nspace, and has fallen back upon the globe in rain and snow. These rains\r\ncorrode and wash the surface of the crust, and finally by their excess\r\ncover the whole crust of the earth with an ocean, marked _o_. Thus the\r\nliquid centre and the solid crust are wrapped in a mantle of water.\r\nThis universal ocean is not cold and clear as are the oceans of to-day.\r\nThe intense heat of the globe has made these waters boil and send off\r\ndense clouds of steam, and thus the water-wrapped world is further\r\nenveloped in a veil of mist.\r\n\r\nWould it then have been hidden from our sight if we had been Afrites,\r\nwatching it as we sat on some far-off planet? No; we should have seen\r\nit still, grown smaller and paler perhaps, but the mist-veil would have\r\ncaught and reflected the sunlight, as the clouds do at sunset.\r\n\r\nThis was the reign of the waters upon the surface of the globe, while\r\nthe central fires were burning and rolling in the abyss beneath the\r\nwaters and the hardened earth-crust. When we say fires, of this\r\ninterior heat, we must not think of flames, but rather of such heat as\r\nthat of molten metal in a furnace. The universal ocean that wrapped\r\nthe world at this time was full of salt and earthy matter and was\r\nturbid, as a river in flood time. From the deposit of this matter upon\r\nthe earth-crust, rock strata or layers were formed.\r\n\r\nFigure 5 shows us still another stage of earth-building. The reign of\r\nthe waters is disputed by the long-imprisoned heat. This heat exerts\r\nits force, and tugs and lifts at the earth-crust until it bulges and\r\ncracks and rises up, or, as we say, is elevated. Earthquakes and\r\nvolcanoes alternately depress or upheave a part of the earth’s surface.\r\nGreat depressions are formed, into which the waters gather, while the\r\nthick earth-crust is tilted up into mountain chains, marked _z_, which\r\nare reared above the waters. These wrinkling folds of the crust are the\r\nworld’s first dry land.[2]\r\n\r\nAt that time we, as Afrites, would have flown from our distant planet\r\nback to the earth, and have laughed to see the fire or heat driving\r\naway part of the water from the surface. We should have danced with\r\nglee to see the volcanoes pouring out ashes and cinders, and to watch\r\nthe cinders crumbling and changing and beginning to form new rocks and\r\nlighter soil. And so at last we should have seen our earth formed, a\r\nrude earth, rough and bare, its seas warm and muddy, its mountains\r\ntreeless, its fields without a single blade of green, a veil of mist\r\nall about it. And how long did it take to complete all this? No one can\r\nanswer. No one can number the years of creative ages. Earth-building is\r\nnot a process that can be hastened. After the globe had reached the\r\nstate which we have now indicated, vast successive changes took place\r\nuntil our own time. Science has divided the succession of these changes\r\ninto periods or ages, and at these periods we shall now glance, as at\r\nsome marvellous panorama.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] This theory is not universally accepted; some consider that the\r\ninterior of the earth by cooling and pressure may be in a much harder\r\nthan molten state.\r\n\r\n[2] At the present time the interior of the earth has probably become\r\nmuch more solid than in the earlier building ages. We really _know_\r\nlittle of it below a depth of a few miles from the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CONTINENT.\r\n\r\n    “As he who sets his willing feet\r\n    In Nature’s footprints light and fleet,\r\n    And follows fearless where she leads.”\r\n\r\n                 --LONGFELLOW, _Keramos_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience in study, scientists have divided the story of\r\nearth-building into vast epochs, known as times. The times are again\r\ndivided into ages. At first the names used for these times were derived\r\nfrom the Latin, and simply meant first, second, third, and fourth\r\ntimes.[3] The first time or period was that in which dry land first\r\nappeared above the waters. The fourth time meant the period during\r\nwhich mammals, fruit, grain, and man appeared. The second and third\r\nperiods or times of course divided the interval between these two.\r\n\r\nOther names, made from Greek words, are now coming into general use\r\nto represent these building periods.[4] If we put these new names\r\ninto plain English, they mean the time of first life, or first living\r\nthings,--the age of ancient life, when most of the fossils, or\r\npetrified plants and animals which we now find, were buried up in the\r\nrocks; then the middle time; and finally the “new time,” when man and\r\nmost of the plants and animals that now belong in the world appeared.\r\nSuch long hard names make the beginning of science seem dry and dull,\r\nbut we must not be alarmed: a very beautiful garden has sometimes a\r\nrough and ugly gate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOOKING FROM AFAR.]\r\n\r\nThe _ages_ into which the _times_ were divided have their names\r\neither from what was produced in them, or from the part of the world\r\nwhere their rocks chiefly appear on the present surface. Thus the\r\nCarboniferous age is the carbon or coal age, because then most of our\r\ncoal-beds were formed. The Silurian age, on the other hand, takes its\r\nname from a part of Wales, where its rocks are most conspicuous, and in\r\nthis part of Wales a people called Silures used to live. A study of the\r\n“Table of Earth-building,” which is the frontispiece of this book, will\r\nshow clearly these times and ages.\r\n\r\nIt is concluded that the first land which appeared was a range of\r\nrocks, which is best known in the valley of the St. Lawrence River, and\r\nrepresents the oldest land on the globe. We need not fancy that the\r\nnew continent occupied a large part of the globe; it was comparatively\r\nvery small. Neither can we look for it to-day, and find it as when it\r\nrose over the hot ocean. The first land of the world lifted above the\r\nwaters and sank again, and so rose and sank more than once or twice in\r\ngreat lapses of time. This rising and sinking was caused by the action\r\nof heat and steam in the interior of the earth, which elevated and rent\r\nthe crust.\r\n\r\nFrom Labrador to Lake Superior the old Laurentian rocks crop out. If\r\nyou go to the Adirondack Mountains, you stand on the first continent,\r\nthough it is now covered with a soil which did not exist in that early\r\ntime of its uplifting. There are spots of this old continent in Nova\r\nScotia, New Brunswick, Sweden, Norway, Bavaria, and the Hebrides. These\r\nare then, the oldest parts of the world, and you could take your atlas,\r\nand by sketching a continent, long, narrow, and crooked, that would\r\ncover these places with a few outlying islands to help it out, you\r\nwould have a fair idea of the first continent. Probably nothing grew\r\non it, but in the sea there were some plants and animals.\r\n\r\nThe beds of Laurentian rocks in North America are sometimes thirty\r\nthousand feet thick. These early rocks, more than any others, show the\r\naction of great heat. The action of heat has changed the rocks from\r\ntheir first condition. Time and heat will turn sand, lime, and clay\r\ninto crystal and marble.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the Laurentian age was supposed to have been wholly\r\ndestitute of any life, and was called the azoic, or life-lacking time.\r\nBut Sir William Dawson, after long explorations among the Laurentian\r\nrocks, found in them the fossil remains of a once living creature. He\r\nnamed this creature the Dawn Animal, or Eozoön. The name suggests that\r\nthis is the most ancient animal yet discovered, and represents the dawn\r\nof life on our planet.\r\n\r\nWhat was this Dawn Animal like? So far as can be judged from the\r\nfossil, it was a very large creature, soft and gelatinous like a\r\njelly-fish.[5] It had a stem by which it was fastened to the bottom\r\nof warm, shallow seas. Thus it never moved from its place, but swayed\r\nwith the moving waters, and perhaps had the power of expanding and\r\ncontracting itself. Like the mollusks,[6] the Eozoön wanted a house for\r\nits delicate body. Therefore, as it swayed to and fro, it collected\r\nfrom the water carbonate of lime, and covered itself with a thin\r\nshell or crust. As it continued to grow it continued to cover itself\r\nwith crust after crust of lime. This lime crust was not a solid\r\nmail over Eozoön; it was rather like a fine net or sieve through the\r\npores of which could pass the jelly-like threads or filaments whereby\r\nthe creature collected lime and food. But here we are led to another\r\ndiscovery. If the Eozoön was a living animal, it must have had food\r\nto nourish it, and living creatures feed upon animal or vegetable\r\nsubstances.[7] Therefore in these warm seas there must have been minute\r\nanimal or vegetable organisms which Eozoön could gather with its long\r\nnets or lines, as it grew at the bottom of the sea. Was the Eozoön\r\nbeautiful? We cannot speak positively; but as we find no age of the\r\nworld when there was not beauty of form and color, as we see beauty\r\noften followed as an end in creation, we may suppose that the Eozoön\r\nhad gay colors and looked like some great vivid flower waving upon its\r\nstem in the water.[8]\r\n\r\nThere are beds of limestone in the Laurentian rocks, which bear\r\nindications of former animal life. Also in the Laurentian rocks there\r\nare beds of iron ore, and these have been supposed to indicate that\r\nthere was some vegetation in the Laurentian period. Now as in the\r\nLaurentian period the Eozoic age shows us vast beds of iron, graphite,\r\nand limestone, we may suppose that there were in the warm waters of\r\nthat era great beds of eozoön like the coral reefs of to-day. In the\r\ndeep seas of the present age there are myriads of little creatures\r\ncalled foraminifera; and though we have found no trace of these in the\r\nearliest rocks, it may be that the first ocean swarmed with them and\r\nthat they were then busy building limestone strata just as they are\r\nbusy now.\r\n\r\nDuring the Eozoic age the warm, turbid ocean that nearly covered the\r\nglobe constantly deposited sediment, and at last the thin earth-crust\r\ngave way under the strain and weight upon it. The earth-crust\r\ncollapsed, or fell in, as a great floor which has been overburdened.\r\nWe sometimes hear of the floors of large rooms which give way under\r\nsome heavy strain. If we go to see a place where such an accident has\r\noccurred, we shall notice how flooring and timbers do not fall flat,\r\nas a whole, but are crushed and crowded together sidewise or edgewise.\r\nWhen the Laurentian continent sank, many of its ranges and beds of rock\r\nwere bent and tilted in this fashion, and we so find them to-day.\r\n\r\nHow long was this first or Eozoic period? That, no one can tell. If\r\nwe should try to tell, we should merely use numbers so great that, as\r\napplied to years, we cannot imagine them. The Dawn age seems a very\r\ngood name for it, as it was the age of the earliest continents, and of\r\nthe first animal and vegetable life. As the study of the earth goes on,\r\nand other and deeper-lying rocks are examined, we may learn much more\r\nabout this first world-building period. Now, as we look far, far back\r\nto it, it strikes us, I think, chiefly as distant, barren, silent. If\r\nwe had been Afrites, and hovering over that early continent, I think\r\nwe should not have heard a sound, except the lap of the warm waves on\r\nthe rocks; we should not have seen a living thing. But if instead of\r\nAfrites we had been Pixies, or water-sprites, we should have gone\r\ndown into the waters of that wide, warm sea, and what should we have\r\nfound? We can as well fancy ourselves Pixies as Afrites. Let us fancy\r\nourselves in those seas. I think we should have seen sea-weeds, fine\r\nand small, but of many curious shapes, and millions of creatures with\r\nand without shells, some large, some small, tinted like rainbows, and\r\nlively and happy in their water-world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Quaternary.\r\n\r\n[4] Eozoic, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, Cenozoic.\r\n\r\n[5] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lessons 36 and 37.\r\n\r\n[6] Nature Reader, No. 1, Lesson 37.\r\n\r\n[7] Nature Reader, No. 3, Lesson 1.\r\n\r\n[8] And after all so few and indefinite are the traces, that Eozoön may\r\nnot have been an animal form at all, but a merely mineral structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III.\r\n\r\nTHE AGE OF CRABS AND CORALS.\r\n\r\n    “And delving in the outworks of this world\r\n      And little crevices that they could reach,\r\n    Discovered certain bones laid up and furled\r\n      Under an ancient beach.”\r\n\r\n                                     --INGELOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth-building period which followed the dawn of life is called\r\nthe “time of ancient life.” Our lesson about this period will be like\r\nunlocking the gate to some beautiful domain, giving a glance at its\r\ndelights, but leaving the wayfarer whom we have brought thus far on his\r\njourney, still standing without, yet now, no doubt, with ability and\r\ndesire to enter.\r\n\r\nThis ancient-life time is, so far as we know, the longest of all the\r\nearth-building periods. It has the thickest deposits of rock, and\r\nincludes the most numerous ages, or great successive changes. It also\r\nretains in its rocks numerous fossils, or casts of formerly living\r\nthings, both animal and vegetable. In coming lessons we shall discuss\r\nwhat fossils are, and describe some of these ancient plants and animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WATER-SPRITES.]\r\n\r\nWhen this new age of the world opened, we find that there was plenty\r\nof life, and that there were many creatures akin to some that we have\r\nliving to-day. To enjoy that time of the world we should have been no\r\nlonger Afrites, or flame-spirits, for the reign of the fire was over;\r\nwe should have been Pixies, and able to wander at our will among the\r\nplants and animals in the water. There we should have noticed that\r\nthere were many animals of the articulate or jointed class--creatures\r\nthat have no backbones; and we should have seen that the plants were\r\nsea-weeds of various kinds. As the ages of this great time moved on,\r\ncreatures with vertebræ forming backbones appeared, and the land had\r\nvegetation. There were reeds, rushes, lichens, ferns, mosses, plants of\r\nthe toad-stool kind, and great trees such as are now not found on the\r\nearth. Some of the rushes called calamites were larger than the great\r\nbamboo.\r\n\r\nThe first age of this great time is called the Cambrian, from the\r\noutcrop of its rocks in North Wales, the ancient Cambria. The name\r\nHuronian has also been applied to it, as these rocks largely appear\r\nin the region about Lake Huron. In this age new land rose above the\r\nocean. The waters were still warm, and the atmosphere was hazy and full\r\nof moisture, hot, but without clear sunlight. The animals were corals\r\nand crabs; the vegetables were sea-weeds. The rocks of the Cambrian\r\nare chiefly sandstone and slate, and we find the fossils not scattered\r\nthrough all the rocks, but in layers, so that some ledges of rock are\r\nnearly destitute of organic remains, and then come others crowded with\r\nfossils of animals and vegetables.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest and most curious of the fossils are the lingulæ.\r\nThese are bivalve[9] shells, about the size and shape of your\r\nfinger-nail. The lingula was fastened to the sand bed by a fleshy\r\nstem. Opening its valves, it put forth a fine fringe which served it\r\nas fingers for gathering its food from the waters, much as barnacles\r\ndo.[10] The lingulæ belong to the group of lamp shells, and have\r\nexisted through all the ages from the Cambrian until now, as they\r\nswarm at the present day in the China seas. Along with the busy little\r\nlingulæ lived many varieties of crabs, cuttle-fish, star-fish, and many\r\nkinds of corals.\r\n\r\nProbably there were not many insects in this period: only a few\r\nfossils of large insects somewhat like dragon-flies and May-flies\r\nhave been found. There were no birds, and the great forests of reeds\r\nand club-mosses were silent, unless the few insects could produce a\r\nchirping sound. Possibly their wings and bodies were gaily colored as\r\nthose of the dragon-flies are to-day.\r\n\r\nNo doubt, also, many of the crustaceans of this period were very ornate\r\nin their colors, and in the arrangement of bands, knobs, and ridges on\r\ntheir shells. The numerous corals building in the shallow seas, and\r\ncarrying their reefs up into the light on the surface, waved purple,\r\norange, and crimson filaments from their limestone towers, until the\r\nwaters looked like garden beds in full bloom.\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest fossils are worm-casts,[11] from which we learn that\r\neven so long ago the worms were helping to build the world. The sponges\r\nshared the shallow seas with the corals.\r\n\r\nNext came the Silurian age, named as we know from a part of Wales where\r\nits rocks lie bare. This was a very long age, and is divided into\r\nupper and lower Silurian. During all this time the world was becoming\r\nricher and richer in life, both of animals and vegetables, and of both\r\nland and sea. We find strangely beautiful fossils of this age, as, for\r\ninstance, the stone lilies. No form of life seemed for a time so hardy\r\nand so rich in variety as these stone lilies. These were not plants,\r\nbut animals, and yet they looked more like beautiful snowy flowers than\r\nlike animals.\r\n\r\nIn very deep water of the present day we find some few species of these\r\ncrinoids, or stone-lily animals, and from them we can understand those\r\nof the ancient time. They grew rooted in one place, waved on long,\r\npliant stems, and from their snowy cups spread forth filaments that\r\nlooked like delicate stamens and pistils. Swimming about among the\r\nstone lilies, went the nautilus, relative of our “paper nautilus” of\r\nwhich the poet sings:--\r\n\r\n    “This is the ship of pearl, which poets feign\r\n    Sails the unshadowed main--\r\n    The venturous bark which flings\r\n    On the sweet summer wind its purpled wings,\r\n    In gulfs enchanted where the siren sings,\r\n    And coral reefs lie bare,\r\n    Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming hair.”\r\n\r\nThe nautilus of the Silurian time perhaps looked quite as lovely and\r\nharmless, yet really was a mighty monster, devouring millions of its\r\nfellow-denizens of the deep. To-day we see a relation of this old-time\r\nnautilus, in our cuttle-fish, sometimes called the devil-fish.\r\n\r\nTo the Silurian age belong the written stones. The tiny fossils\r\nimbedded in these rocks are like little coal-black stains, which appear\r\nas minute writing in an unknown tongue. These small cells are indeed\r\nwriting, and help us to learn the story of the ancient world.\r\n\r\nThe corals increased greatly in the Silurian age, and extended far up\r\nto the polar regions, where corals are now unknown. In these early\r\nages the chief home of life was in the sea. The waters brought forth\r\nliving things before the earth produced them, while the creatures of\r\nthe air, the birds and insects, came later still. Two very important\r\nfacts are here to be noted: Just as the Silurian age was closing,\r\nseveral kinds of fish-like creatures appeared, the first vertebrate or\r\nbackboned animals.\r\n\r\nLet us imagine ourselves back in that age, as Pixies, or water-sprites.\r\nSuppose that we are in a warm, shallow, almost waveless sea, over which\r\nthe sunshine pours, warm and mellow, through thin haze. We are sitting\r\non a ledge of coral, and from every tiny limestone tower about us opens\r\nand waves a radiant creature, purple, gold, green, or crimson. Among\r\nthe corals grow the tall and stately stone lilies, rolling back their\r\npetal-like valves, and waving forth long white plumes. We gather tiny\r\nlive things from the water and offer them to the stone lilies, and they\r\ngrasp them in their snowy hands.\r\n\r\nBut now we see a monster coming towards us, a new creature such as we\r\nhave never seen before! It swims strongly, has a thick skin, great jaws\r\nfilled with big teeth, and we perceive that it has its bones inside\r\nits body, not outside, as the crustaceans do. It sweeps past a bed of\r\npretty little lingulæ and crops off fifty of them at a mouthful! It\r\ndarts up to our lovely stone lily, and bites it from its pearl-white\r\nstem! Yonder comes a crab swimming along at ease, a prophecy of a\r\nking-crab, that will come many ages after. The fish-like monster takes\r\nhim at a mouthful.\r\n\r\nWe Pixies are angry at this devastation; we cry, “We hope you will try\r\nto eat a trilobite[12] and choke yourself!” But here comes an unlucky\r\ntrilobite, and the new monster crushes it in its great jaws! It would\r\neat us, only we are Pixies, creatures of myth, mere bubbles. As it is,\r\nwe hide in our coral groves, and weep over our lost lingulæ and stone\r\nlilies. These fish-like creatures reign as kings. They multiply and\r\ndevour, and in the Devonian age, which comes next, they become more\r\nlike true fishes.\r\n\r\nThis Devonian age comes with mighty changes. We Pixies feel the\r\nsea-beds rock with earthquakes. We fly to the rivers, and find the land\r\nrent with volcanoes. We hasten to the crests of the waves,--for the\r\ntorrents of lava rush along the shores and far out into the ocean,--and\r\nwe see the Afrites laughing to find vast plains of land where waters\r\nhad been. We hope that all these convulsions have destroyed the greedy,\r\ncruel fish. But no; we go deep into our sea-homes, and find most of the\r\ncrabs and nautili and stone lilies gone, and the fish more abundant\r\nthan ever!\r\n\r\nAnd now we Pixies feel that the new age has come, and we rise to the\r\nsea-surface to look about, and we find new land in many lovely islands,\r\nand there are vast swamps full of reeds and club-mosses. Green lowland\r\njungles laugh in bright sunlight, among warm, clear, blue seas,\r\nwhere the corals that we love grow to their greatest glory. No more\r\nsoft-shelled crustaceans and trilobites: have the fishes eaten them\r\nall? If we make an excursion to the land to see if any fairies live\r\nthere, we find no flowers, but there are very beautiful trees.\r\n\r\nThe great work of this Devonian age seems to be the rapid laying down\r\nof beds of red sandstone. This red sandstone, deposited by the waters,\r\nfinally rises into vast continents, joining island to island, and\r\nspreading out a rich soil, very fit for vegetable life. Vegetation\r\ncreeps away beyond the polar circles; for in this time the climate of\r\nthe earth is nearly uniform.\r\n\r\nLet us fancy we meet an Afrite, and say to him, “Of what use is all\r\nthis land and vegetation?”\r\n\r\nHe replies, “O Pixy! a new age is coming,--the age of coal. In it vast\r\nbeds of coal will be laid down to feed future fires for a creature\r\ncalled man. These beds will have oil, gas, naphtha, all things in which\r\nwe Afrites rejoice. These carbon beds will be merely storehouses of\r\nwell-cooked vegetation, for warming and lighting a world.”\r\n\r\nBut as we Pixies stand and talk with Afrites at the limit where land\r\nand water meet, what do we see? We see thousands of insects in the air\r\nand creeping on the ground,--cockroaches, dragon-flies, weevils. And\r\nnow, oh, wonder of wonders! what fearful thing is this? A REPTILE HAS\r\nAPPEARED!\r\n\r\nFrogs and toads of curious patterns have foreshadowed him, but the true\r\nreptile was the first vertebrate lung-breathing animal. You perceive it\r\nis a vast advance on earlier forms, for a creature to have a nose, to\r\nbe able to inhale air through its nostrils!\r\n\r\nThe life-filled, tree-filled Carboniferous age, with its continents\r\nwas long, very long; and now, when life seemed everywhere to dominate,\r\nthese continents slowly sank beneath the waters, and the Permian\r\nage came on,--the age of the death and burial of a busy world,--the\r\nlast age of the ancient life time. The sinking was slow at first, so\r\nslow that trees grew above the buried trees; but at last the sinking\r\nhastened, and stones and sand and surf dashed and rolled above the\r\nforests, and the Coal age was drowned.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this sinking was, that the interior of the globe had\r\ncontinued to cool and harden, and with cooling shrank from the crust,\r\nwhich collapsed in great wrinkles. The collapse was slow, because much\r\nof the interior rock was in a wax-like condition, and crowded up to\r\nfill the rents left in the downward pressure of the earth-crust. The\r\nheat, pressure, collapse, half-fluid state, explain to us many of the\r\ncuriosities of geologic formations.\r\n\r\nAfter these convulsions the surface again arose, land lifted above the\r\nwater, and the Permian age exhibited a flora very like that of the\r\npreceding age. The great frogs, toads, and lizards increased in size\r\nand numbers. The convulsions of the Permian had not destroyed all land\r\nlife, and probably the sea-depths with their inhabitants had been but\r\nlittle effected. The buried forests of the previous age were slowly\r\nchanged into the coal-beds of to-day, and in them we find, held for our\r\nstudy, seeds, roots, leaves, insects, and footprints, belonging to the\r\nlong-gone ancient life time.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Nature Reader, No. 1, Lesson 39.\r\n\r\n[10] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 33.\r\n\r\n[11] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 12.\r\n\r\n[12] See Lesson XVI., p. 119.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV.\r\n\r\nTHE REIGN OF THE PINES AND THE REPTILES.\r\n\r\n        “A monster then, a dream,\r\n    A discord. Dragons of the prime,\r\n    That tear each other in their slime,\r\n    Were mellow music, matched with him.”--\r\n\r\n                --TENNYSON, _In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GNOMES IN A CAVE AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the middle period of the earth-building story. We\r\nhave thus far seen how from a great globe of burning gas, our earth\r\nshrank, cooled, hardened, became wrapped in waters, uplifted continents\r\nand islands, and through successive periods became filled with plants\r\nand animals of sea and land. The period at which we have now arrived\r\nwas the age of wonderful monsters, of pines, and of palms. For the\r\nfirst time also the earth was splendid with flowers. The seas grew\r\nconstantly cooler, and the earth crust as constantly thickened. As the\r\nseas cooled less vapor rose into the air, the atmosphere cleared, and a\r\nbright sunshine poured over the continents.\r\n\r\nThe continents of this middle period of world-building were some of\r\nthem larger than now. Probably North America stretched over much nearer\r\nto Europe; England was not an island, but was joined to the mainland\r\nof Europe, and extended far south and west in what is now the sea.\r\nThe mountains were very high, so high that it has been supposed that\r\nthey had snow-covered tops, and glaciers formed in their gorges, and\r\nicebergs, breaking from the glaciers, sailed off to distant seas.\r\n\r\nAt this time the earth was green with ferns and grasses and dark with\r\nforests. Among the most noble of the trees were the cycads. They were\r\npartly like pines, and partly like palms. Beside the cycads grew great\r\npines, and probably pines were the distinguishing trees of this cycle.\r\nThe vegetation was more like the present vegetation of the tropics than\r\nlike that of northern climates, because the earth was warmer then than\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nIn our last lesson we spoke of the red sandstone as a very rapid\r\ndeposit of sand by water. When the deposit is slow, the red color is\r\nwashed out of the sand by the action of air and water. This red of the\r\nred sandstone is due to iron-rust, which stains the sand as it does\r\niron or steel. When the deposit of these stained sands is rapid, in\r\nthick beds, the color does not have time to bleach out. There are two\r\nvast layers of this red sandstone, the old and the new. The new is\r\nlargely present in the beds of the middle period of world-building,\r\nand sometimes gives the first age its name--the age of the New Red\r\nSandstone. The northern shore of Scotland is banded by the old red\r\nsandstone, as if held in a sandstone frame.\r\n\r\nAnother rock of this time is called conglomerate, or mixed stone. Some\r\ncall it “pudding-stone,” and say it looks like a pudding full of plums\r\nand lumps of suet. Such stone is very common, various kinds of pebbles\r\nand rocks being held together as if they had been baked or boiled into\r\none mass. Near the conglomerate we sometimes find limestone full of\r\ntiny broken shells, and also beds of marl. Marl is a rich greenish\r\nearth, which crumbles easily and is valued for enriching cultivated\r\nlands.[13] All these varieties of rock are interesting when we study\r\nthem, and can read the stories they tell of long-gone ages, of fire,\r\nvolcanoes, earthquakes, floods, storms,--where strange animals and\r\nplants lived and died.\r\n\r\nDo we ever stop to think what a treasure-house of wonders and of choice\r\nand beautiful things the earth is? There are sands filled with grains\r\nof pure gold, and rocks where gold glows in grains and veins and\r\nnuggets. I have seen lumps of silver-bearing rock which look as if in\r\nsome age of heat the pure silver had melted, boiled, and bubbled until\r\nnow it lies in the stone in curious shapes, like balls, and stars,\r\nand chains, and moss, and tiny trees,--all fantastic and pretty forms.\r\nThere are mines where diamonds, and rubies, and garnets, and sapphires\r\nlie hid as if the gnomes, or fabled earth-spirits, had stored them\r\naway. What crystals shine among the rocks, and red bands of carnelian\r\nglow, and purple amethysts and vivid carbuncles blaze! Kings have rooms\r\nfull of such treasures kept for show; but the silent earth hides in her\r\nbosom many more and far richer jewels.\r\n\r\nCome here, and let me show you just one marvel made in the earth in\r\nsome of these long building periods, when heat was working wonders.\r\nSince you have been handling all these minerals and curiosities your\r\nhands are dirty. Take this towel and wipe them. Look at the towel. What\r\ndo you see?\r\n\r\n“Just a coarse cotton towel,” you say; “nothing fine about that.”\r\n\r\n“Very well. Have you wiped your hands? Here, let me throw the towel\r\ninto the fire.” You stare at that.\r\n\r\n“Do you always burn your towels?” you ask.\r\n\r\n“I never burn them up. I just wash them in fire. Look sharp!” You\r\nlook. The fire curls into and over and about the towel, and it becomes\r\nred hot, yet does not fall into ashes. Watch me. I take the tongs\r\nand pick my towel from the fire. As it is, red hot, I dip it into a\r\npail of water. Now it is cool, pray take it and examine it. It is\r\nclean and whole as if new! That towel is made of rock! It is called\r\nasbestos. It is a very hard rock, and lies in layers of fine, silky\r\nfibres. You can pull these fibres or threads off, and apart, like flax;\r\nthey can be spun and woven. Plenty of it is found in Canada. See,\r\nit looks like common cotton cloth. Found in thin sheets it is called\r\n“mountain-leather,” in thick sheets it is named “mountain-cork.” But\r\nit is all asbestos--a rock fibre. And what do they do with it? They\r\nmix fire-proof paints with it; make boiler felting; firemen’s cloaks;\r\ngloves for fire-workers. Long ago the ancients wrapped dead bodies in\r\nit, so that their ashes might not be lost when they were burned upon\r\nthe funeral pyre. Wonderful stuff, is it not? But the brown still earth\r\nis full of such wonders.\r\n\r\nLet us return to look at the products of the middle period of\r\nearth-building, and see how the world grows more and more fit to be\r\nthe home of the coming man. We find now palm, fig, oak, tulip, walnut,\r\nand sweet-gum trees. As all these trees produce fruits, seeds, or nuts\r\nsuitable for food for animals, we should look for animals to feed upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe find the fossil bones of some of the dwellers in these woods; the\r\nrocks also retain their footprints. The great creatures, marching over\r\nthe soft earth and mud, made deep tracks, and these remained like casts\r\nor moulds as the soil hardened; then sand and other sediment were\r\ndeposited over them, and so the footprints were encased. The deposit,\r\nhardened into rock, has preserved the footprints for thousands of\r\nyears. Strange that a thing so fleeting as a footprint on sand should\r\nremain to tell a story for ages!\r\n\r\nBut what of the creatures that made these footprints? These were huge,\r\ntwo-legged animals with three-toed feet, stalking through the woods,\r\nand calmly browsing on the tree-tops! Science reconstructs some of\r\nthese creatures, and finds that they had small heads, long necks, huge\r\ntails, and thick legs. These were mild but hideous creatures, and\r\nmunched nuts and fruits. They may have glistened in the colors of the\r\nrainbow for all we can tell, but even color could not make beautiful a\r\ncreature with a giraffe’s neck, an elephant’s legs, a crocodile’s tail,\r\nand a kangaroo’s head.\r\n\r\nI think we may be very glad that we did not live in that age. Who could\r\nhave played in a wood filled with such fearful creatures? Who would\r\nhave wished to go out in a row boat, or for a little sail, when the sea\r\nwas full of monsters, like sea-serpents, and all the rivers swarmed\r\nwith huge reptiles? Little beasts like rats and kangaroos began to run\r\nin the woods, but there were no shy rabbits, no squirrels with full,\r\nwaving tails and bright black eyes. What would woods be worth to ramble\r\nin, if not a bird flew, sang, or pecked upon a tree?\r\n\r\nWe can fancy that far down in the heart of the earth the fabulous\r\ncreatures, the gnomes, were busy. The Danes and the Germans have tales\r\nof queer little men, called gnomes, which live and work underground,\r\nand have charge of all the metals and jewels in the earth. The gnomes\r\nwear little pointed caps, and shoes with pointed toes. If in this\r\nfar-off age we had been gnomes, we should have seen in the earth\r\nbeautiful crystals forming.\r\n\r\nDiamonds, rubies, emeralds, all the precious gems and all the choice,\r\nfine stones, such as carnelian and agate, are very hard and of close\r\ngrain and can take a brilliant polish, but as they lie in the earth\r\nthey may look dull and pale, and be covered with a crust or case of\r\ncommon stone or clay. Cutting and grinding bring out their clear light\r\nand beauty. If we had been gnomes, wandering through the interior of\r\nthe earth, we should have wondered who and what the coming creature\r\ncould be, for whom was stored up things so rich and rare and useful.\r\nFor whom were the vast beds of iron, coal, salt, tin, veins of precious\r\nmetals and gems, rivers of oil, storehouses of gas? And some day, as we\r\nworked with tiny pick and crowbar, we might hear coming to meet us the\r\npick and spade of earth’s new master--man! But that would be long, long\r\nafter the Mesozoic, or Middle age of world-building had passed away.\r\n\r\nAs the ages followed each other, there would constantly be new\r\ntreasures hidden for the gnomes to guard. As one layer after another\r\nwas buried by new material, in the buried layers were left the bones,\r\nteeth, footprints, and remains of the reptiles, insects, birds, and\r\nland animals of the passing age. Every new earth-bed was a vast\r\ngraveyard.\r\n\r\nThe last age of the middle building-time was called the Cretaceous, or\r\nChalk age, because during it such vast quantities of chalk were built\r\ninto rocks. All the English coast along the Channel is lined with\r\nchalk cliffs. The chalk is soft and white and easily worked. When, in\r\nEngland, we went down on the sand beach, and wanted something to play\r\nwith, we would take a lump of the chalk cliff and whittle out balls\r\nwith our knives. When we were done playing we left the balls for the\r\nsea to carry off; it was so easy to cut more. I often saw stables,\r\ncow stalls, wagon sheds, cut out of the chalk to save the farmer the\r\ntrouble of building sheds of wood. The chalk cliff made fine, dry,\r\nclean houses for the animals.\r\n\r\nStuck all through this chalk, like plums in a cake, are hard flints or\r\npebbles, and these can be cut and polished into very pretty jewelry.\r\n\r\nThe Chalk age was one of great and violent changes. Once more the\r\ncontinents began to sink. The earth-crust could not uphold the mighty\r\nweight of deposit upon it. The shrinking and cooling core caused the\r\nsettling of vast stretches of land, and the continents were depressed\r\nlower than they had been since the time of the first continent. Down,\r\ndown went the land, and over it the waters flowed, and where hills and\r\nforests had been, creatures of the deepest depths of ocean played.\r\nEurope probably settled lower than America.\r\n\r\nOnce more the globe was like a vast ocean, above which rose what had\r\nbeen high ranges of mountains, now forming long islands or reefs. Of\r\nthese surrounding ridges might have been noted the hills of Great\r\nBritain, the Scandinavian Mountains, and the Ural range. In the Western\r\nhemisphere the hills of the St. Lawrence and the Appalachian Mountains\r\nrose over the water, and here and there a peak of the Rockies or the\r\nAndes.\r\n\r\nWhy did the little hills of Britain rise up when the great Alps and\r\nthe Himalayas were not to be seen? Britain itself did not sink so low\r\nat that time, and the Alps and the Himalayas were not yet born. They\r\nrose at a later day. The seas ebbed and flowed and deposited their\r\nchalk sediment over a drowned globe for a very long time. Then once\r\nmore the earth crumpled, and amid earthquakes and volcanoes the Chalk\r\nage perished, the Rocky Mountains, Alps, and Himalayas were crowded and\r\ntilted up to be the great mountain-ranges of the world, and the last\r\nbuilding-time of the earth had come.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] Marl is also used with sand in making Portland cement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON V.\r\n\r\nTHE PALM AND THE MAN.\r\n\r\n    “So careful of the type she seems,\r\n      So careless of the single life.\r\n\r\n    ‘So careful of the type?’ but no,\r\n      From scarped cliff and quarried stone\r\n    She cries, ‘A thousand types are gone,\r\n      I care for nothing, all shall go!’”\r\n\r\n               --TENNYSON, _In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: READY FOR MAN.]\r\n\r\nWhat have we thus far found to be the processes of earth-building?\r\nFirst, rocky crust uplifted into mountain ridges. Then deposit of\r\nsediment by the waters until islands and continents capable of\r\nmaintaining animal and vegetable life are formed. Ages of increase and\r\nsuccessive growth follow; then sinking of the earth-crust, accompanied\r\nby earthquakes and volcanoes; after this, fresh upheaval. With these\r\nsurface changes come changes in the plant and animal life, especially\r\nin the former; for plants seem not to have the happy faculty of animals\r\nin accommodating themselves to new conditions. With the changing ages\r\nsome animals entirely disappear, and are known to us only by their\r\nfossil remains. Others are modified and fitted to their new home.\r\n\r\nWe must observe that in no period of sinking after the first land age\r\nwas the land all covered by water, nor were all the living things of\r\nany period destroyed. There has been a continuance of animal life on\r\nthe globe from the first earth-building time until now. The Permian\r\nand Chalk ages were probably the periods of greatest changes. During\r\nthe Chalk age certain of the later forms of life appeared. The fruit\r\ntrees, and all the highest and most choice forms of vegetable life,\r\nwere present among the plants. Fishes and reptiles, crabs and lobsters\r\nlike those which now live, and the first specimens of the great Order\r\nof the Mammals, were found in the troubled seas of the Chalk age. It\r\nwas with plants that are called exogens or outside growers, having\r\ntwo seed-leaves,[14] such as our fruit trees, and the oaks, maples,\r\nchestnuts, and elms, that modern plant life began. When the mammalians\r\ncame, they were the advance guard of the higher class of animal life.\r\nThis class of mammalia includes all animals which have young which are\r\nnourished with milk by their mothers.\r\n\r\nThe first age of the Neozoic, or New Life period, is marked by\r\na certain singular kind of limestone rock, called nummulite or\r\nmoney-stone. The stone receives this odd name from a great variety of\r\nflat shells which fill the rock, and have been fancied to resemble\r\npennies, shillings, and sixpences. These nummulite shells are very\r\ncurious; some are so small that you can scarcely see them without a\r\nmicroscope; others are as broad as the above-named coins. Each shell is\r\nmade up of a great number of little cells, set in rings, beginning with\r\na very small ring about the central cell, and the next a little larger,\r\nand so on. The shells were the homes of creatures called foraminifera,\r\nsome of which are now living and building shells in the bottom of our\r\nseas.\r\n\r\nWhen these creatures were alive these cells were filled with a soft\r\nsubstance such as we see in jelly-fish.[15] We can scarcely realize\r\nthe vast amount of work done by these small, feeble creatures, in\r\nearth-building. The nummulites were the stonemasons of continents.\r\nThe nummulite sandstone is found in beds, sometimes thousands of feet\r\nthick. Imagination fails to compass the multitudes of tiny living\r\ncreatures which piled up ten thousand feet of the Swiss Alps, and built\r\nthe snowy peaks of distant Thibet, and grain by grain laid up the long\r\nchains of the Pyrenees.\r\n\r\nLittle microscopic creatures, close kin to these nummulites, built\r\nthe rocks in Egypt of which the Sphinx and Pyramids are made, and the\r\nenormous platform upon which they stand. These little animals also laid\r\nup the vast beds of building stone of which nearly all the great city\r\nof Paris is made. How did they do this? The little jelly-like creatures\r\nwanted covering for their frail bodies, and so gathered from the\r\nsea-water particles of lime and built them into shells. Millions upon\r\nmillions of these shells fell down in layers on the sea-floor, and then\r\nwater, weight, and heat became the forces to consolidate the myriads of\r\nshells into stone. The processes of earth-building are slow and long.\r\n\r\nThe last world-building period, the Neozoic, had five ages. You will\r\nfind their rather hard names on the plate which is our frontispiece.\r\nWe might look at them as a splendid panorama. Shall we imagine that\r\nas fairies flitting through the woods; gnomes guarding the treasures\r\nof the earth; fair Pixies, floating in the rivers and seas; or giant\r\nAfrites standing in the hottest sunshine on the desert, we watch these\r\nfive beautiful and wonderful ages roll on?\r\n\r\nWhat shall we see? Palms first: great tracts of palms, waving their\r\nfeathery tops against the sky. The earth was warmer in those days\r\nthan now, and plants and animals, now ranked as tropical, were found\r\nas far north as England. Not only were there palms widely spread, but\r\ncypress, plane trees, maples, elms, oaks, red-woods, figs, sweet gums,\r\nsour gums, tupelos, cinnamon and clove trees. The cape jasmine swung\r\nits censers of perfume; ferns and mosses made the woodland depths soft\r\nand green. Through these forests, and over the grassy plains, roved\r\nhyenas, wolves, bears, elk, antelopes. The famous mastodon was there,\r\nwith many forms of deer, and thick-skinned creatures of the elephant\r\nand rhinoceros tribes that are now known no more. Along the river\r\nsides, among the sedges, were great wading birds, turtles, tortoises,\r\ncrocodiles, serpents. Insects and birds increased, and here and there\r\na monkey might be seen climbing among the tree-tops.\r\n\r\nAs time moved on, a new, strange change overtook the earth. The climate\r\nin the Northern hemisphere became colder and colder; frost and snow\r\nheld possession of lands that had hitherto been warm and sunny. Colder,\r\nstill colder; what is called the Glacial or Frozen period was drawing\r\non. As the atmosphere and soil chilled, fir, pine, birch, and dwarf\r\nwillow succeeded to the palms; animals of woollier coats lived where\r\nthe thick-skinned, smooth-coated, tropical animals had found a home.\r\nThe ice-sheet, which at this day wraps the poles, began to extend\r\nsouthward, and an icy sea, such as now washes the shores of Greenland\r\nand the North Cape, rolled over the northern half of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe Ice period has occasioned much dispute and wonderment among men of\r\nscience. Its remaining traces are chiefly drift, ice-markings such as\r\nice-worn rocks and boulders, with the bones of animals and the traces\r\nof Arctic plants found far south of the regions which such organisms\r\noccupy at the present time, or did occupy in an age earlier than the\r\nGlacial. They indicate a period when ice and cold had sway in lands now\r\ntemperate.\r\n\r\nIn a future chapter we shall consider for a little the work of icebergs\r\nand glaciers in carving the world. At present we can only say that\r\ngeologists consider that the ice-cap came down to the 40° parallel of\r\nlatitude north, while others believe that the frequent ice-markings and\r\nboulders found throughout the temperate zone are the work of icebergs\r\ndrifting in Arctic currents, and swept much further south than they\r\nare now seen. Up to this period we have considered red-hot worlds,\r\nmelted worlds, drowned worlds; the Glacial age gives us a frozen world.\r\n\r\nBut the one great fact written over the face of the globe is change.\r\nEarth-building sweeps through great circles or periods of change. That\r\na certain state exists is, it seems, merely proof that presently it\r\nwill not be, but will have made room for some new and different state.\r\nEven the Ice age was not to last forever. Frost was king for a time,\r\nas fire had been king and water had been king. But the Ice age began\r\nat last to loosen its cold clasp upon the world. The atmosphere grew\r\nwarmer; the land rose up above the icy seas; the bergs sailed into\r\nequatorial regions and were dissolved in the warm currents of the Gulf\r\nStream.\r\n\r\nThe Northern hemisphere never returned to the warmth of climate it had\r\nenjoyed before the Ice age came on, but it gained the mild temperature\r\nof to-day. As the ice-sheet slowly retreated plants sprang up on the\r\nearth, the flora following the withdrawing edges of the ice. There was\r\nan age when in England and Ireland and France flowers bloomed which now\r\nare found only on the high Alps. After a time the flora of the earth\r\nbecame what it is now.\r\n\r\nThe mastodon and his associates disappeared, and sheep, horses, and\r\ndogs, and the bovine animals,--the animals that especially contribute\r\nto the comfort and service of man,--became numerous. On the surface\r\nof the earth streams and rivers did their work, and arable land was\r\nready for coming harvests. The Ice age had been a bitter winter\r\ntime; it was followed by a spring. Centuries stormy as March, and\r\nchangeful as April, and soft as May, followed each other, bringing\r\nthe earth-building epochs to a close, and putting on the globe the\r\nfinishing touches to fit it for the home of humanity. Now at last were\r\nseen the cereals, the corn-food of man, the stately and golden maize,\r\nthe silver wheat, the bearded barley. With these came the gourd and\r\nlupine families, bringing us all manner of melons, cucumbers, pumpkins,\r\npeas, lentiles, and beans. The hosts of the apple order of fruits were\r\nmarshalled in array; the peach, plum, cherry, apple, pear. The vine and\r\nthe olive covered the slopes; earth was now a rich and splendid kingdom\r\nwaiting for its destined king. The king came, and flora and fauna were\r\nat his service; his name was MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Nature Reader, No. 3, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[15] Nature Reader, No. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI.\r\n\r\nTHE STARRY HEAVENS.\r\n\r\n    “Sit, Jessica: Look how the floor of heaven\r\n    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold;\r\n    There’s not the smallest orb, which thou beholdest,\r\n    But in his motion like an angel sings,\r\n    Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim.”\r\n\r\n                       --_Merchant of Venice_, Act 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kitten plays with its tail, the lamb nibbles the grass, the chick\r\nscratches on the ground for a living, and none of them feel any\r\ncuriosity about the reason of things around them. But the smallest\r\nchild begins to ask questions, especially about the natural objects\r\nthat surround it. It is not satisfied with having water to drink; it\r\nwants to know from whence water comes. Fruit is good, but how do fruits\r\ngrow? No doubt the first human beings felt this same curiosity, or\r\nrather desire for knowledge, the food of the mind. As soon as there was\r\na man to observe natural objects, what they were, and how they came to\r\nbe, were questions that early presented themselves to his attention,\r\nand afforded theme for the first legends and fables.\r\n\r\nThe wonders of the heavens were among the primary subjects of human\r\nthought. The rising and setting of the sun, and his splendid way\r\nthrough the sky; the milder beauty of the moon; the marshalled hosts\r\nof the stars aroused the admiration, interest, even worship, of the\r\nearliest representatives of our race. Men concluded that the heavenly\r\nbodies were gods or men, who for great deeds had been taken to shine in\r\ndeathless glory in the skies. With enlarging ideas they understood that\r\nthe stars are worlds, but they had no means of determining how large\r\nor how distant they might be. The first students of the skies thought\r\nthat the earth was the largest of the heavenly bodies, and stood\r\nstill, while the others moved. They considered also that the earth was\r\nflat, and that the skies above it were a vast hemispherical dome. Such\r\nnotions are instinctive even at the present time.\r\n\r\nHow natural it is for us to believe that the earth is the lower half of\r\nthe universe, and the skies the upper half! We speak as if the heavens\r\nand the earth were two separate creations. We are slow to recognize\r\nthe fact that the earth is merely one little part of the heavens. The\r\nheavens are about us on every side. By the heavens we mean that part\r\nof space which seems to be star filled. In these heavens our world\r\nis as a globe suspended, and every star that we see is another globe\r\nsuspended in space. Of these globes we can, with the unaided eye,\r\nsee countless thousands; millions more are reached only by powerful\r\ntelescopes; very likely myriads still exist which no glass is strong\r\nenough to bring into human sight.\r\n\r\nIn ancient times people fancied that the stars ruled the lives of men,\r\nand from them came good or evil influences, wars, famines, plagues.\r\nThey foretold the events of years by the stars that showed highest and\r\nbrightest, and cast the horoscopes of individuals by dividing the sky\r\ninto “houses” or sections, and considering the appearances of these\r\nhouses at the hour when a child was born. This pursuit was called\r\nastrology, and it extended to the study of comets, eclipses, and all\r\nthe appearances of the skies. This astrology was an elaborate science,\r\nand one of the most ancient studies of men, and by degrees led the way\r\nto the present noble science of astronomy.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the skies they seem to be crowded with shining bodies\r\nsown thickly together without any particular order. Looking more\r\ncarefully, we see that in parts of the sky the stars are thickly\r\nclustered, and that there seem to be empty spaces. We observe too\r\nthat there are differences in the size, brightness, and color of the\r\nstars. Some stars are red, some white, some blue, some green or yellow:\r\nsome shine with a clear, steady ray, some quiver, tremble, disappear,\r\nreappear.\r\n\r\nDuring the day we cannot see the stars, because of the greater\r\nbrightness of the sunshine. When the moon is full and bright at night\r\nthe stars seem dim, but on a cloudless, moonless night the stars are\r\nwell displayed.\r\n\r\nThe early observers divided the stars into constellations, and traced\r\nupon the sky fanciful figures of chairs, dragons, sheep, crowns, bears,\r\npersons, each of these constellations having some few prominent stars\r\nand a number of smaller ones. While the outlines of these objects are\r\nentirely fanciful, the arrangement is of great use in helping us to\r\nfind or describe stars.\r\n\r\nDistant in the starry space are vast shining clouds, which were once\r\nsupposed to be whirling masses of vapor or “star dust,” and received\r\nthe name of nebulæ, or clouds. Better telescopes have revealed the true\r\ncharacter of the nebulæ, and we find that they are thickly crowded\r\nstars, so immensely distant that their light mingles as one mass, and\r\nthe spaces between them are not seen. It is also true that there are\r\nsome nebulæ which are really “cloud-masses of glowing gas.”\r\n\r\nWandering among the stars are seen at times brilliant bodies with\r\nlong trains or tails of glowing vapor. These are comets. Once their\r\nappearances caused great terror, as indicating disaster to the human\r\nrace, and even now some persons are alarmed lest one of these sky\r\nwanderers should, in his frantic flight, run against our earth and\r\ndash the poor little globe to pieces! But these comets are not such\r\nvagrants as they seem. Law reigns in all the universe, and even comets\r\nare subject to it, and come and go on a distinct track. The motion of\r\nmany comets has been determined, and their return into the range of\r\nour vision is accurately foretold. There are some comets which always\r\nremain in our own solar system; others come from the depths of space,\r\npass about our sun, and dash away into infinite distance to return no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nVarious opinions are held as to the material of comets. Some consider\r\nthat they are composed of myriads of small bodies like tiny meteors;\r\nothers consider them made of gas. The head or nucleus is doubtless\r\nmore solid than the tail, and it has been found that tails of comets\r\ndiffer in composition; they contain hydrogen, carbon, iron, chlorine,\r\nand other kinds of matter, such as we have in our world. The tails of\r\ncomets always turn _from_ the sun, and as the comet nears the sun in\r\nits circuit the tail expands; as it leaves the sun the tail decreases\r\nin size.\r\n\r\nSome comets have no tails, some have several. It is supposed that the\r\ntails of comets diminish and finally disappear, from destruction of\r\ntheir expanded material by the sun’s heat as they repeatedly draw near\r\nto the centre of our system.\r\n\r\nSome comets go and come in their orbits in three or four years, others\r\nroam for centuries before they sweep again into our range of sight.\r\n\r\nAs marvellous as the comets, are the temporary stars. Several instances\r\nare on record where stars have suddenly appeared where no star had been\r\nseen before. They shone for a time with splendor, then faded away. In\r\nNovember, 1572, a magnificent new star shone in the constellation of\r\nCassiopeia. In eighteen months it vanished. During the seventeenth\r\ncentury “Kepler’s Star” appeared in the constellation of The Serpent\r\nBearer, and surpassed all the finest stars near it in brightness. It\r\ngradually lessened, and in two years was lost to view.\r\n\r\nOther wonders of the heavens are the variable stars. The light of\r\nthese stars changes greatly. Week after week they brighten as the sun\r\nbrightens from dawn to noon; then for an equal period they pale and\r\nfade, to revive in splendor and again to wane.\r\n\r\nThere are also stars that fix our attention by being binary or double.\r\nThese are twin stars situated very close together, and revolving around\r\neach other. After the binary stars were discovered, it was found that\r\nthere were also multiple stars; that is, three or four stars similarly\r\nsituated in relation to each other, and circling about each other.\r\nThese binary and multiple stars are usually of different colors, as a\r\ngreen and a red, an orange and a blue, or blue, green, orange, and red\r\nin a four-fold star.\r\n\r\nMost of the stars are so very far from us that we cannot learn much\r\nabout them. What we call our own solar system embraces our sun and a\r\ncertain number of planets, which depend on our sun for heat and light,\r\nand constantly move about the sun in great and nearly circular paths.\r\nBy means of telescopes and other instruments we are able to study our\r\nown sun and his system of dependent planets. When we examine distant\r\nstars they seem to us to be like our sun, and so we conclude that like\r\nhim they may be centres of systems and have planets wheeling about them.\r\n\r\nIf there were such planets we could not see them, owing to the\r\ngreatness of the distances. Planets are dark in themselves, as our\r\nworld is, and shine only by reflected light from their suns. These\r\nsuns are the stars of the field of heaven. Suns are stationary with\r\nrespect to their accompanying planets, but with respect to other\r\nsystems it is probable that each system is in motion and moves about\r\nsome distant centre, led by its sun along some path which no mind can\r\ncalculate.\r\n\r\nAs we look upon the heavens we can consider that all these glowing\r\nbodies are moving on some majestic path through infinite space. The\r\nstar Alcyone, in the Pleiades, has been conjectured by Mädler of\r\nDorpat to be the centre of gravity, or central sun of all the known\r\nuniverse.[16] The Pleiades, often called “The Seven Stars,” are a\r\ngrape-shaped cluster, of which six stars are large and beautiful, while\r\nmany smaller ones appear like a soft, golden haze.\r\n\r\nAncient poets said that once there were seven Pleiads, but one wept\r\nitself out at the fall of the city of Troy. That is a pretty fancy; but\r\nif one of those so distant stars had gone out when Troy fell, its light\r\nmight yet be shining for us, and certainly would have shone on Ovid,\r\nwho told the tale. A poet has written truly:--\r\n\r\n    “Were a star quenched on high,\r\n      For ages would its light\r\n    Still travelling downward through the sky,\r\n      Fall on our mortal sight.”\r\n\r\nSo vast are these star-distances that it takes hundreds of years for\r\nthe light of a star to reach us, and yet light moves one hundred and\r\neighty-six thousand miles a second! This is much faster than Puck, who\r\ncould “put a girdle roundabout the earth in forty minutes!”\r\n\r\nWhat an immensity is this about us! All that void amid the starry\r\nsystems we call stellar or inter-stellar space. Lit by so many\r\nsplendid suns, is it not then glowing with the light of high noon a\r\nmillion times multiplied? No. The higher we rise above the earth, the\r\ndarker becomes the color of the sky, until it hangs like a pall of\r\nunspeakable blackness. Why is this? Why is light not light? Why this\r\nabsolute darkness among so many, many suns? It is simply lack of dust!\r\nThere must be something to throw back and scatter the rays of light\r\nbefore it can be visible. Unless far up in stellar space there is\r\ndust, star-dust, a whirl of motes or stones to seize and throw back\r\nthe light, then all must be very dark. Here on our own little globe\r\nthe glorious sunbeams lighten us, thanks to dust in our atmosphere.\r\nThe sunshine reveals to us the dust, but the dust makes the sunshine\r\nvisible. Sunbeams and dust, each one invisible without the other!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] This, of course, is merely a conjecture, which it would need ages\r\nof observation to confirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VII.\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT OF THE MILKY WAY.\r\n\r\n    “And now the still stars make all heaven sightly.\r\n      One, in the low west, like the sky ablaze;\r\n    The Swan, that with her shining Cross floats nightly,\r\n      And Bears that slowly walk along their ways.\r\n    There is the golden Lyre, and there the crown of fire:\r\n      Thank God for nights so fair to these bright days.”\r\n\r\n                            --LOWELL, _Summer Nightfall_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking up into the heavens we cannot fail to notice a broad, shining\r\nband that crosses the sky. We are early told that this is the Milky\r\nWay, receiving its name from its pale, silvery light and its path-like\r\ntrack across the firmament. All the heavenly bodies are arranged in\r\nclusters or nebulæ; no one of them is isolated. The Milky Way is one\r\nof these nebulæ. Its shape is that of a wide, irregular ribbon deeply\r\nnotched at one end. The reason of the white and shining appearance of\r\nthe entire nebula, is that it is densely crowded with stars, and is so\r\nimmensely distant that the spaces between the stars are lost to view.\r\nAbout one hundred years ago Herschel endeavored to count the stars in\r\nthe Milky Way. He found eighteen millions of stars in the central belt\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nHow long is this nebula? Light starting from one limit of its longest\r\ndiameter, and travelling one hundred and eighty-six thousand miles\r\na second, would travel fifteen thousand years before it reached the\r\nlast shining star in the Milky Way! Such distances as this are beyond\r\nour power to imagine. The Milky Way is a gigantic cluster of suns,\r\nand if each sun has its planetary system about it, each system rides\r\nlike a shining archipelago in these seas of space. Earth and all other\r\nplanets, being dark in themselves, do not count in these burning\r\ndistances. So then our sun is but a star, and the Milky Way is made up\r\nof millions of such stars. More than this, our sun is one of the many\r\nstars that compose this wonderful band of light. We have now found our\r\nplace in the heavens--we are a portion of the Milky Way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HUNG IN SPACE.]\r\n\r\nAll the large stars which grace our most brilliant nights belong to\r\nthis same great cluster. We are ourselves lying near its centre.\r\nAmong all these suns our own appears to us to be the largest and most\r\nmagnificent. This is because it is nearest to us, and it is to us the\r\nsource of life, light, and heat. There may be other suns of tenfold\r\nsplendor, and there may be other nebulæ far larger and more crowded\r\nwith suns than the Milky Way.\r\n\r\nThere are other nebulæ which have received different names, from\r\nthe shape of their outlines, as globular, annular, spiral, double,\r\nmultiple; the Crab, the ship Argo,--which is shaped like a comet,--the\r\nMagellanic clouds, and so on. These lie like splendid islands\r\nrocking in distant space, so far away, that if we travelled with the\r\ninconceivable speed of light, we might be millions of years in reaching\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nMany of the greatest human minds have, during many ages, been occupied\r\nin studying our solar system, investigating its laws, measuring its\r\ndistances. The discoveries so made have been applied to other systems,\r\nand in this way, by long and slow but sure degrees, the science of\r\nastronomy has been built up.\r\n\r\nFrom ancient times it has been the custom to divide the stars into\r\nclasses according to their apparent size. This apparent size depends\r\nchiefly upon their nearness to us, and evidently, as the few only are\r\nnear, and the many are far off, stars of the first magnitude are few\r\nin number, and as they diminish in apparent size the number embraced\r\nin the successive classes increases. Thus we find but eighteen stars\r\nof the first magnitude; but of the third there are one hundred and\r\nseventy, of the fourth five hundred, and thus on.\r\n\r\nWhen we look upward in a starry winter night we fancy we can see\r\nmillions of stars. In truth with the unaided eye we can see only six\r\nthousand at most, and it needs very strong eyes to see more than four\r\nthousand. But when we turn a telescope upon the sky we begin to count\r\nstars by millions.\r\n\r\nAll the stars are in apparent motion; they have their rising and their\r\nsetting as does the sun; the constellations appear above the horizon,\r\nand move swiftly down the sky. Only one star is, as viewed from our\r\nworld, immovable, remaining forever fixed in its place; we call it the\r\nNorth Star, or the Pole Star, because to us of the Northern hemisphere\r\nit seems to be always watching above the Northern Pole. But, while\r\nunalterable as regards us, the Pole Star is not released from the\r\ngeneral law of motion which rules the stars.\r\n\r\nWhen we begin to trace out constellations, we usually take the Pole\r\nStar as our starting-point. The Pole Star is in the tail of the\r\nconstellation of the Little Bear, and we find it by imagining a\r\nstraight line drawn from the two upper stars in the square of the Great\r\nDipper. The Great Dipper we shall easily find, as it is composed of\r\nseven large, bright stars, four of which form an irregular four-sided\r\nfigure and from one corner of this square three others extend in a\r\nslightly curved line. This constellation, seen from any place north\r\nof New Orleans, La., never sets, but slowly turns around the fixed\r\nPole Star. In ancient times the Great Dipper was sometimes called\r\nthe Chariot, or David’s Chariot, and among English country people it\r\nis known as Charles’s Wain, a wain being an old English name for a\r\nwagon. The Chinese name the Great Dipper “The God of the North”; the\r\nMohammedans often call it “The Hand of God.” It is also called the\r\nGreat Bear.\r\n\r\nOf all the stars the one nearest us is in the southern constellation\r\nof the Centaur; but that is so far off that its distance is beyond our\r\ncomprehension, being over two hundred and eleven thousand times as far\r\ndistant as the sun. If we could take a ray of light for our steed we\r\nmust ride three years and six months to reach this sun that is nearest\r\nto our sun in the starry hosts.\r\n\r\nBut is light for a steed all that is wanted for such a trip among the\r\nstars? No; for a very little way from our earth we should be in want of\r\nan atmosphere, or air to breathe, and also in want of light and heat.\r\nLight, heat, and air are probably alike lacking in starry space.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider the orbs which compose our own solar system, their\r\nmotions and relationships, which we shall do in another chapter, let\r\nus consider for a little the theory of the origin of systems, taking\r\nour own for a sample of the rest. Tennyson the poet, puts the story of\r\nsystem-building thus:--\r\n\r\n    “This world was once a fluid haze of light\r\n    Till toward the centre set the starry tides,\r\n    And eddied into suns that wheeling cast\r\n    The planets.”\r\n\r\nWe saw in a previous lesson that our world was once a vast ball\r\nof fiery vapor. The great astronomer Laplace, after many years of\r\nstudy, published a theory about system-making, called the “Nebular\r\nHypothesis,” which, as simply as we can put it, is this: First, there\r\nis a great cloud of glowing vapor, the various particles of which\r\nare by the law of gravitation drawn toward a single centre. As the\r\nparticles press equally to the centre from all sides, it is evident\r\nthat the first result will be a ball of constantly increasing solidity.\r\nThis nebulous mass possesses also a motion of rotation, or turning over\r\non its own axis. As the ball grows smaller and more dense, it will spin\r\nround faster and faster.\r\n\r\nThe gaseous matter of the sphere having become fluid or partly fluid,\r\nthe ball still whirls on, and we must now notice a second motion,\r\ncalled centrifugal or tangental, which has become more apparent as the\r\nrotation increases in velocity. While by the force of gravity all atoms\r\nseek the centre, by this centrifugal force atoms are driven from the\r\ncentre. This tangental motion is familiarly seen in the case of mud\r\non a wheel-tire, the mud being flung off from the wheel by a motion\r\ncreated by rotation. So from the spinning globe a ring of matter will\r\nbe detached and fly off into space.\r\n\r\nIf this ring were equally hard and thick in all its parts, and exactly\r\npoised about the globe from which it sprung, it might keep the ring\r\nshape. But in nearly all cases the ring when flung off would be\r\nirregular, and would consequently break up. As it broke, the largest\r\nfragments, keeping the wheeling motion and made spherical by gravity,\r\nwould draw into themselves the smaller near fragments. Then, after a\r\nwhile, following the example of the globe from which they spun off,\r\nthese new globes would cast off rings of matter which would contract\r\nand harden into globes, and become their satellites or attendants, as\r\nthey, held by the force of gravity, remain attendants upon the first\r\ngreat globe.\r\n\r\nThis is the nebular theory of system-building. We see that in it three\r\nthings are pre-supposed, or taken for granted; first, matter in a\r\nstate of slowly rotating glowing vapor; second, a law of gravitation;\r\nthird, a law of tangental motion. In the one hundred years since this\r\nhypothesis was first developed by Laplace, no one has ever seen the\r\nglowing vapor consolidating to suns. These processes are far too long\r\nto have been within any human observation, but long and careful study\r\nhas enabled man to learn some of the wonderful laws by which the\r\nuniverse is governed.\r\n\r\nLet us see if this explanation of Laplace fits anything which we find\r\nin our solar system. Has any great globe rings wheeling about it? Yes;\r\nthe huge planet Saturn has a triple ring. Besides this ring, Saturn has\r\neight moons, as if some other ring had broken up, and its parts had\r\ncome together into satellites. The planet Jupiter has four satellites,\r\nMars has two, Uranus has four, Neptune one, and our earth has one,\r\ncalled the moon. There are also in our system a number of very small\r\nplanets, closely grouped, called asteroids. In the nebular hypothesis\r\nthese asteroids might represent matter cast off at first in rings,\r\nbreaking and finally condensing into spheres. Here we find in our solar\r\nsystem between the larger planets Mars and Jupiter a splendid zone of\r\nminor planets.\r\n\r\nComets are also explained by this theory, as large masses of material,\r\ntoo evenly balanced among the planets to yield to the attraction of\r\nany one of them, but owning the attraction of the sun, the centre of\r\ngravity of our entire system, and wheeling about it in vast elliptical\r\norbits. Finally it is supposed by some that the general speed of\r\nour entire system is slackening. This “slowing up” of the system is\r\nsupposed to be due to the friction of ether which pervades all space,\r\nand also to a great depth of hot and expanded material more thin than\r\nair, which extends about the sun, wrapping it in a vast, fine mantle of\r\ngas, as our atmosphere surrounds our globe.\r\n\r\nBut if it is true that the motion of our system is growing slower, it\r\nwill be many millions of years before the change will be great enough\r\nto notice; just as, granting that the sun is losing its heat, it will\r\nbe many millions of years before it ceases to shine upon and warm our\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\nIn fact the lessening of speed in the solar system, and the lessening\r\nof sun heat, are as yet only theories and not proved facts. The sun\r\nwill shine on, and the worlds will whirl around it, through time which\r\nno human mind can calculate.\r\n\r\nAttraction, the attraction of the sun over the planets, and the\r\nplanets for each other, has been several times mentioned. What is this\r\nattraction? Attraction is a “drawing to.” If a magnet be held near\r\nsteel filings it attracts the particles of steel, and they adhere\r\nto the magnet; this attractive power is magnetic attraction. The\r\nattraction or pulling power which bodies have for each other, is called\r\nthe attraction of gravity or of gravitation.\r\n\r\nAll bodies have this attraction for each other, but in small bodies\r\nwe do not observe it. Its force is due to the weight or mass of the\r\nbodies, and diminishes as their distance from each other increases.\r\nIt is by this force, or attraction of gravitation, that whatever is\r\nthrown into the air falls towards the earth. If you throw up a ball it\r\nmoves upward, obeying the force you put into your throw, but soon that\r\nforce is used up, and the earth pulls the ball back. You jump, and you\r\nrise from the earth by the force expended by your legs in the act of\r\njumping, but that force is used up soon, and the earth pulls you down.\r\nYou jump from a tree or roof, and down you come to the earth, pulled by\r\nthe force or attraction of gravitation.\r\n\r\nThis force or attraction, exerted by the great strong sun over our\r\nearth and all other planets, keeps them travelling in nearly round\r\npaths about the sun. This attraction, exerted by the earth over the\r\nmoon, keeps the moon travelling in a nearly circular path about the\r\nearth. And does not the moon then attract the earth? Oh, yes, all\r\nbodies attract each other; but the moon is of much less weight or mass\r\nthan the earth, and her pull is weak in comparison; she cannot pull\r\nthe earth out of her orbit. She does pull something however, and what\r\ndo you suppose she pulls? She pulls the water that is on the earth,\r\nheaping it up in the tides! The tide is simply the ocean obeying the\r\nattraction of the moon.\r\n\r\nIt seems a pity that in a few simple lessons on the solar system, we\r\nshould use any terms that are hard to be understood. But some few such\r\nterms we have been obliged to use. “Attraction of gravitation” is one\r\nof these which we have tried to make a little plainer. “Inclination of\r\nplane to orbit” is another. What does that mean? Can we make it clear?\r\n\r\nLet us set a lamp on the table, and call it the sun. Now take an orange\r\nand call it the world. Call the stem-place, and the spot opposite, the\r\npoles of this world. Next run a knitting-needle through the orange,\r\nfrom pole to pole, to represent the axis on which the earth turns. As\r\nwe spin our earth-orange around on its axis, let us move our needle\r\naround the lamp, in a lemon-shaped path. This shape is called an\r\nellipse. Thus we represent the earth turning around on its axis, or\r\nover and over, and at the same time travelling around the sun.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that we can hold our knitting-needle straight out,\r\nhorizontally, or we can hold it straight up and down, perpendicularly,\r\nas it moves around the sun-lamp. But neither of these straight\r\npositions would represent the direction of the axis of the earth;\r\nwe must _tip_ the needle a little, so as to hold it in a slanting\r\nposition. Now if we held the needle exactly up and down, or exactly\r\nstraight out, the sun-lamp would shine on just half of the orange, as\r\ndivided from pole to pole. But when we tip the needle you see we bring\r\nour orange-world in such a position that, as it passes around the\r\nsun-lamp, the light falls now more around one pole, now more around the\r\nother; this tipped position is “inclination to the plane of orbit.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VIII.\r\n\r\nPLAN AND PROGRESSION.\r\n\r\n    “They rise in joy, the starry myriads burning--\r\n    The shepherd greets them from his mountains free;\r\n                And from the silvery sea\r\n    To them the sailor’s wakeful eye is turning--\r\n                Unchanged they rise--”\r\n\r\n                                           --HEMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now found that our earth is one among several planets revolving\r\naround a great central star which we name the sun. The sun and his\r\nattendant planets and their satellites form what is called the solar\r\nsystem. We have also found that the heavens are filled with such\r\nsystems, and that these are gathered together in nebulæ or clusters.\r\nProminent among these clusters is the Milky Way, near the centre of\r\nwhich our system is placed.\r\n\r\nThe bodies which in our system revolve about the sun, are called\r\nplanets. With respect to the sun and other great stars the planets are\r\nsmall, but considered in themselves they are enormous bodies. They\r\nare all dark spheres,[17] having no light in themselves. Is it true\r\nthat the moon with her silvery radiance and Venus and Mars with their\r\nsteadfast beams, are dull and dark as burnt-out cinders? This is indeed\r\ntrue; the planets receive their light and heat from the sun, and it\r\nis as they reflect back this light that they shine so brilliantly. As\r\nan example of such reflection take a new tin plate; it has no light\r\nin itself; shut it in a dark room, it gives out no light; but hold\r\nit where a broad ray of sunshine strikes it, and at once the light is\r\nreflected back from the tin with such burning splendor that the eyes\r\ncan scarcely look upon it. So we have observed windows struck by the\r\nlight of the setting sun, and at once blazing forth like fires.\r\n\r\nThe planet nearest to the sun is named Mercury. It is distant from\r\nthe sun about thirty-five millions of miles,[18] and is the smallest\r\nof the eight major planets. Mercury is so close to the sun that it is\r\nnearly always lost in the sun’s light, and can be seen by the naked\r\neye only occasionally, immediately after a clear sunset, or before a\r\nclear sunrise. The telescope shows us that Mercury has phases as the\r\nmoon has; possesses, as far as known, no satellites, and its path is\r\nnot so nearly in a circle as that of other planets. To the naked eye it\r\nappears as a small star, with a white light faintly tinted with red.\r\nLying so near to the sun it receives much more light and heat than we\r\ndo. Its day is twenty-four hours long; its year has but eighty-eight\r\ndays, and each of its seasons is but twenty-two days long. The\r\nshortness of the year and of the seasons is the result of the nearness\r\nof the planet to the sun, which so shortens its path that it can be\r\ntraversed in less than three of our months.\r\n\r\nThe next planet in order of distance from the sun is Venus, the most\r\nbeautiful of what we popularly call stars. But Venus is a planet, not\r\na star. Venus is visible nearly all the year, and is often the first\r\nstar to shine forth in the evening or the last one to fade away in the\r\nmorning. It has even been seen shining at noon-day. This dazzling\r\nlight of Venus is supposed to be caused by a dense layer of cloud,\r\nwhich wraps the planet about, and proves an admirable reflector of\r\nthe sun’s rays. The day of Venus is about half an hour shorter than\r\nour own;[19] its year is two hundred and twenty-four days. The French\r\nastronomer, Flammarion, tells us that mountains, much higher than any\r\non our earth, have been measured on the planet Venus. The changes of\r\ntemperature on Venus are much more sudden than on our earth; but it has\r\nno ice at the poles, for its winter does not last long enough for ice\r\nto accumulate as it does at the earth’s poles.\r\n\r\nAs the orbit of Venus is between the earth and the sun, it happens that\r\nat certain times Venus lies between the sun and the earth, and so shows\r\nus its dark side. Again, when it is to the right or left of the sun, we\r\nsee only a crescent formed by its quarter,[20] and it is at this phase\r\nthat its mountains have been measured.\r\n\r\nVenus is sixty-six millions of miles from the sun, and when nearest\r\nus about twenty-six million miles from the earth, being, with the\r\nexception of the moon, our nearest neighbor in the skies.\r\n\r\nThe third planet from the sun is our earth, ninety-two million miles\r\nfrom the source of its light and heat. Circling around the earth, and\r\nmoving with it in its orbit, goes the moon. The earth rotates on its\r\naxis once in about twenty-four hours, giving us day and night in that\r\nperiod of time, according as, during its revolution, a part of the\r\nsurface is turned to or from the sun. As the earth rolls over upon\r\nitself, it also rolls along its orbit, or sky-path. The path of the\r\nearth about the sun is travelled over in three hundred and sixty-five\r\nand a quarter days, giving us our change of seasons by the inclination\r\nof the earth’s axis to the plane of its orbit.\r\n\r\nNext removed beyond the earth from the sun, is the splendid planet\r\nMars, which is easily distinguishable by its red light. It is in some\r\nparts of its path only seven millions of miles further from the earth\r\nthan Venus. Mars has a day of about the same length as ours, and its\r\nseasons are of nearly the same intensity; but while a season is three\r\nmonths long with us, on Mars it is very nearly six months, for Mars\r\ntakes almost two of our years to travel round the sun. Mars has a snow\r\nor ice-cap at each pole; it has also an atmosphere, as with a telescope\r\nwe can observe clouds drifting across its sky, the clouds being\r\nformed as clouds here, by the evaporation of water from the surface\r\nof the globe, which moisture, being carried up in invisible vapor, is\r\ncondensed by colder currents of air and forms clouds.\r\n\r\nThe red light of Mars is supposed to be produced by the color of its\r\nsurface, and by some it is considered that the vegetation on Mars may\r\nbe red, as ours is green, and that to an observer on Mars, our planet\r\nwould shine with a green light, as to us Mars shines in red. The poles\r\nof Mars are always white. Next after the moon Mars is the planet best\r\nknown to us, because sometimes, as our globe and Mars pursue their\r\npaths through space, they come upon the same side of their path at the\r\nsame time, which shortens the distance between them, and enables close\r\nobservations to be taken.\r\n\r\nBetween Mars and the next planet Jupiter there is a very great space,\r\nso great that astronomers considered that it could not be empty, but\r\nmust have in it planets too small for easy observation. They therefore\r\nresolved to search that part of the sky constantly and carefully with\r\ntelescopes. On the first day of this century a small planet was seen\r\nin this space, and was named Ceres. This was the first-found asteroid.\r\nFrom their small size these planets are called asteroids or starlets.\r\nOthers were found, slowly at first, and then more and more; in April,\r\n1891, the 309th was discovered by Dr. Palisa.\r\n\r\nCeres, the first-found asteroid, is so small that one hundred and\r\ntwenty-five thousand little worlds of its size could be made out of\r\nour own world. Fifty little globes like Ceres, set side by side, would\r\nform a line as long as the diameter of our world. As the mass of Ceres\r\nis so much less than that of our world, the attraction of gravity is\r\nless--anything is fifty times as heavy on our world as it would be on\r\nCeres. So if a boy could live on Ceres, and have as much muscular force\r\nas he has here, he could play easily with a ball that here weighs a\r\nquarter of a ton. A baby on Ceres could tumble about a cannon-ball as\r\neasily as a baby here plays with a rubber ball. If a house fell over on\r\na man, he could set it up as easily as here he could set up a fallen\r\npeach-basket. Of course it is only a play of fancy that there are men,\r\nboys, or babies on Ceres. Perhaps there is no living thing there. If\r\nthere are living creatures, all their habits and ways of life must be\r\nvery different from ours. But if people from our earth could go to\r\nCeres, why would they find such wonderful differences there in weights,\r\nand in the effect of an output of strength? We have seen that Ceres is\r\nvery much smaller than our earth; its mass is greatly less, and just\r\nin proportion to the smallness of its mass is the force of the pull it\r\nexerts over objects, or the attraction of gravitation; this attraction\r\nis dependent upon the mass of the body exercising it, and upon the\r\ndistance of the body attracted. When the distance between two bodies is\r\ngreat the attraction is weaker, and when a body is small its attracting\r\npower is less in proportion. Ceres is such a small planet that its pull\r\nover objects is small. Similarly, we might say of the planet Mars that\r\nits mass is so small, as compared with that of the earth, that a body\r\nwhich on the earth would weigh one hundred pounds would weigh much less\r\non Mars; and where you could jump up five feet here, you could rise\r\nmany feet there.\r\n\r\nThe best athlete who can make a jump here, can rise only a few feet\r\ninto the air; then down he comes, pulled by the force of gravity, the\r\nattraction of the earth. But on Ceres attraction is so small an affair\r\nthat a man could jump over a dome as high as St. Peter’s or St. Paul’s\r\nwithout creating any excitement. In fact, on Ceres a man would weigh\r\nonly one-fiftieth part what he weighs here, and the same output of\r\nmuscular activity as is used here would have a fifty-fold value. Much\r\nthe same conditions exist on the other asteroids.\r\n\r\nWhen first discovered it was supposed that the asteroids were fragments\r\nof some very large planet which had gone to pieces. That theory has\r\nbeen disproved, and now the nebular hypothesis of Laplace is generally\r\nadmitted to account satisfactorily for these little planets.\r\n\r\nAfter passing the asteroids in our system, we come to Jupiter, the\r\nlargest of the planets. Jupiter often shines more brightly than Venus.\r\nIt is more than one thousand times larger than the earth, and is seen\r\nduring most of the year. The year of Jupiter; that is, the time which\r\nis required for its journey around the sun, is almost twelve of our\r\nyears. Day and night are equal, and of about five hours each, and there\r\nis probably no change of seasons. But Jupiter seems to be to-day a\r\nstill highly heated body, as our earth was very many ages ago, and its\r\nsurface is disturbed by terrific storms.\r\n\r\nJupiter is accompanied by four moons, and its globe is surrounded by\r\nseveral dark belts, which seem variable in number, but apparently\r\nbelong to its surface. The belts somewhat resemble sun-spots, and\r\nindeed the whole planet is considered by astronomers to be much more\r\nlike the sun than like our earth. The reason that Jupiter does not have\r\nchanges of season is that the inclination of the planet to its orbit is\r\nvery slight. When we consider that Jupiter turns on its axis in less\r\nthan half the time that our earth requires for a rotation, and is also\r\nso very much greater in diameter than our earth, we will realize how\r\nmarvellously rapid its daily motion must be.\r\n\r\nNext to Jupiter in place, and next also in size, is Saturn, the sixth\r\nplanet from the sun. Ancient astronomers supposed that with Saturn\r\nour solar system ended. Saturn has eight moons placed at different\r\ndistances, and is further distinguished by a very beautiful triple\r\nring surrounding the entire planet on its equatorial line. Within\r\nthis glowing triple ring the planet turns, and the rings themselves\r\nare carried round the planet in a circular movement of still greater\r\nswiftness. These rings are not always visible, as they, like their\r\nplanet, shine by the reflection of sunlight, and so are seen only when\r\nthe sun and earth are both on the same side of the planet.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 Sir William Herschel, the English astronomer, who had made for\r\nhimself a very fine telescope, discovered another planet. At first he\r\nsupposed this was not a planet but a comet. Finally it was received\r\ninto the family of the planets and named Uranus. Uranus is much smaller\r\nthan Saturn, but many times larger than the earth. A year on Uranus is\r\neighty-four of our years; that is, it takes Uranus eighty-four years to\r\nmake its circuit of the sun.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of Uranus astronomers began to hope that yet other\r\nbodies belonged to our solar system. They saw that the motion of Uranus\r\nwas often disturbed, as if some other planet near it exercised over\r\nit some attracting force. Searching carefully, a planet was finally\r\nfound, about one hundred times larger than the earth, and so far from\r\nthe sun that to an observer placed upon it the sun must appear like a\r\nlarge star; even the planet’s day would be no brighter than twilight.\r\nThis new-found planet was named Neptune, and is thus far the last known\r\nplanet of our sun system. Its place was determined in 1846. Neptune is\r\nthe only great planet that has been discovered by a set search in the\r\nheavens for it, based on reasoning that such a planet ought to exist. A\r\nFrenchman and an Englishman discovered Neptune almost simultaneously.\r\nThe planet has one moon. Uranus and Neptune are so exceedingly distant\r\nfrom our earth, and from the sun, that the study of them has afforded\r\nvery little of interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] Professor Newcomb considers Jupiter partly self-luminous.\r\n\r\n[18] Sir B. Ball says 36 millions; others 35 millions; Newcomb makes\r\nmean distance 40 millions.\r\n\r\n[19] Sir R. S. Ball.

Within forty-eight hours the globe\r\nwould be covered with a deluge of rain, and buried in piles of snow,\r\nowing to the condensation of all the moisture in our suddenly chilled\r\natmosphere, while more than Arctic cold would freeze the oceans to\r\ntheir depths. In this reign of cold and darkness all animal and\r\nvegetable life would perish. All the planets of our system would share\r\nthe same fate, and as the light with which they shine is reflected from\r\nthe sun, they would become invisible, rolling on through space in total\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nHow far from us is this sun, so important to us as the centre of light,\r\nheat, and attraction? Ninety-two millions of miles. But how far is\r\nthat? An engine running thirty miles an hour, without once slacking\r\nspeed, could go around our globe in thirty-five days. Start it off for\r\na trip to the moon, and with the same speed it would reach there in\r\neleven months. And then send it from the earth to the sun, at an equal\r\nrate of travel: year after year it must rush on, until three hundred\r\nand fifty-one years were passed before it could reach the sun. But so\r\nmuch faster does light travel than a railroad train, that light comes\r\nto us from the sun in eight minutes and nineteen seconds!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THE LIGHT AND THE NIGHT.”]\r\n\r\nThe sun is the centre of our planetary system, and holds all the\r\nplanets in their proper orbits by the force of his attraction. We\r\nhave seen in our glance at the asteroid Ceres, that the attraction\r\nof gravity depends upon the distance and the weight or _mass_ of the\r\nbody exercising it. If our earth should suddenly grow lighter it could\r\nnot hold the moon in its present orbit; if its attractive power over\r\nthe moon ceased, the moon would go tumbling off into space. The sun\r\nexercises immense attractive force by virtue of its enormous mass. If\r\nall the planets were put into one pan of a pair of scales, the sun in\r\nthe other would outweigh them seven hundred times over. Three hundred\r\nand fifty thousand such globes as we live upon would be needed to\r\nbalance the sun.\r\n\r\nThis gives us some idea of the mass or weight of the sun. What is its\r\nsize? Our world is nearly eight thousand miles in diameter at the\r\nequator; over two hundred and forty thousand miles distant from the\r\nearth the moon revolves around it; but if a circle as large as the\r\nsun could be drawn, the earth might be placed in the centre, the moon\r\nrolled in her proper path around it, and beyond this orbit to the line\r\nrepresenting the circumference of the sun would be a distance of nearly\r\ntwo hundred thousand miles more.\r\n\r\nThis vast orb shines with no borrowed ray. It is a great fountain of\r\nburning light which shines now as it shone long before the building of\r\nour world began. No light is so powerful and intense as sunlight. A\r\nflash of lightning is scarcely seen across a sunny sky; the light of\r\nlamps is not visible in strong sunshine; no invented light can approach\r\nsunshine in brilliancy. Twenty millions of the brightest stars would\r\nnot shed upon the earth the radiance poured out by the sun.\r\n\r\nAccording to the nebular hypothesis of Laplace, the sun not only\r\nprovides the planets with light and heat, but is the source and parent\r\nfrom which they sprung into space. Thus the most distant planets, as\r\nNeptune and Uranus, were the ones first thrown off, and the earth, as\r\nonly in the third remove from its source, is one of the latest of the\r\nsun children.\r\n\r\nWe know that in the far-off ages, when the earth was being built into\r\na habitable globe, the sun shone just as it does to-day. We know this\r\nfrom the eyes of fossil animals, which show that they were formed to\r\nreceive sunlight just as eyes do to-day. Also the petrified rain-marks,\r\nof which we spoke in a former chapter, tell the same story; for without\r\nthe sun there would have been no rain, nor would imprints have dried or\r\nbaked so rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe heat and light of the sun are indispensable to the production and\r\ngrowth of all vegetation. Age after age the genial rays of the sun\r\nnourished on this earth an improving and enlarging vegetable growth,\r\nwhich on its decay left added soil for generations of plants to come.\r\nThus the sun was not only the parent but the cherishing nurse of our\r\nlittle globe. We have seen that in the coal period of earth-building,\r\nthe atmosphere of the world was heavily charged with carbonic acid gas,\r\nbut under the stimulating effects of sunshine, vegetation continually\r\nincreased, used up most of the carbonic acid gas, and the atmosphere\r\nbecame constantly richer in oxygen,[21] and more and more fitted for\r\nthe use of animals. Thus we see the sun, as a prudent householder,\r\nstoring up in the world supplies of coal, and purifying at the same\r\ntime the air. Meanwhile, by the action of sun rays on the salt, shallow\r\nseas, vast salt beds were produced and buried, providing a mineral\r\nespecially needful to man.\r\n\r\nOur dependence upon the sun awakens a desire to know something about\r\nthe orb itself; but how can a body so intensely bright be studied?\r\nSmoked and colored glass plates are used, through which the sun can be\r\nobserved with comfort, and there are certain occasions when the study\r\nof this vast, glowing, and distant body can be favorably pursued.\r\nThese especial occasions favorable to sun-study are during an eclipse,\r\nand when the planets Mercury and Venus cross the sun’s disk. Such a\r\ncrossing is called a transit.\r\n\r\nIt was once supposed that the sun was no larger than the moon is, and\r\nas near to the earth as that planet is; both sun and moon were believed\r\nto be much smaller than the earth, and very near to it, and revolving\r\nin an orbit about it. To us the sun appears to rise above the horizon,\r\nmove across the heavens, and sink beneath the horizon, and return after\r\na few hours’ absence to pursue the same path. Meanwhile, the earth does\r\nnot appear to us to move. This is not the only case in which our eyes\r\ndeceive us until we call reason to their aid.\r\n\r\nWhen we are on a swiftly moving train of cars, it seems to us that\r\ntrees, posts, telegraph-poles, go rushing by us, while we remain at\r\nrest. Although no one now questions that the earth moves, and that with\r\nregard to the earth the sun remains fixed in one place, we still use\r\nthe language that fits appearances rather than facts, and we say, “the\r\nsun rises, the sun sets,” when in truth the earth is merely turning\r\nover and over, and so constantly bringing a different part of its\r\nsurface under the sun’s rays.\r\n\r\nAs the various planets move about the sun, in paths which we may call\r\nconcentric circles, or rings set one inside the other, it is evident\r\nthat there may be occasions when the different planets will come\r\nbetween the sun and some planet with an orbit beyond their own. For\r\ninstance, Mercury is a planet travelling in a circle around the sun,\r\nbut a circle smaller than that in which the earth travels. Mercury\r\nmay then sometimes pass across the face of the sun at a time when the\r\nearth is on the same side of the sun, and in that case we can observe\r\nMercury moving like a little black ball across the glowing front of\r\nthe King of the Day. To see such an occurrence we must use smoked or\r\ndarkened glasses, else Mercury would simply be lost in the unshaded\r\nsplendor of the sunlight. Why is not such a transit of Mercury seen\r\nevery year? Every year Mercury must cross the disk of the sun, and the\r\nreason we do not see a transit yearly is that the orbits of Mercury and\r\nthe earth differ in plane, and long periods will elapse between the\r\noccasions when the sun, Mercury, and the earth come into line thus:\r\n[Illustration] As Venus overtakes the earth in its journey around the\r\nsun once every nineteen months, shall we have the benefit of a transit\r\nat each time of passing? No; because Venus is usually either above or\r\nbelow the line of the earth’s orbit. But when at long intervals such an\r\nevent as a transit of Venus does occur, no astronomical incident can\r\nbe more valuable, because it gives us the best means of measuring the\r\ndistance between the earth and the sun.\r\n\r\nA grand opportunity for studying the sun is afforded by an eclipse.\r\nAn eclipse of the sun is occasioned by the moon’s passing between\r\nthe earth and the sun. Children are frequently warned that it is\r\ndiscourteous to pass between a person and the fire or light; our child,\r\nthe moon, happily for us, often passes between us and our fire, the\r\nsun, and on the fortunate occasions when this can be observed out come\r\nthe glasses for sun-study. As the moon revolves about the earth, she\r\nsometimes stands between the sun and the earth. When the moon passes\r\nbetween us and the sun on a clear day, between sunrise and sunset, the\r\nday grows dark, a twilight comes over the world, and continues until\r\nthe moon has crossed the disk of the sun.\r\n\r\nHow can so small a body as the moon obscure so great a body as the\r\nsun, and how can the moon pass in seven minutes across a disk nearly a\r\nmillion of miles in extent? All this can be explained by the nearness\r\nof the moon to our globe, and consequently the moon’s great distance\r\nfrom the sun. Any one of us can hide the sun from us by a dinner-plate,\r\nor even a dime, if we hold it close enough to our eyes. So we can move\r\na dinner-plate across the disk of the sun, by one sweep of the arm. All\r\ndepends upon the nearness to ourselves of the screen used. Now as the\r\nmoon is so near us in time of eclipse, she hides the sun from us; the\r\neclipse may last for an hour, but will be total only for a few moments.\r\n\r\nEvery year there must be more than one eclipse of the sun. The greatest\r\nnumber possible in a year is five, the least two; but these will not\r\nall be visible from the same part of the globe.\r\n\r\nAstronomers call an eclipse partial when the moon passes over one or\r\nthe other side of the sun’s disk. An annular or ring eclipse is one\r\nwhere the moon is at such a distance from the earth, that she hides\r\nonly the central part of the sun’s disk, while around the dark shadow\r\nthus cast appears a ring of splendid light. A total eclipse of the sun\r\nis where the moon is so near us that she hides the entire face of the\r\nsun. This can happen only at long intervals for any given locality.\r\nThus, when there is a total eclipse of the sun visible from New York\r\nCity, it may be hundreds of years before such an eclipse is again seen\r\nfrom there.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is in total eclipse a glorious halo of clear light called\r\na corona, or crown, rays out on all sides behind the black body of the\r\nmoon. Horns, cones, and streamers of violet, scarlet, orange, and pink\r\nlight rise up from this crown, and seem to toss and whirl like clouds\r\nin a storm.\r\n\r\nIn the careful study of the sun with telescopes, it has been found that\r\nthere are spots on its surface, which look as if the outer portion of\r\nthe sun were torn. Now by watching these spots a very wonderful fact\r\nhas been discovered. What do you think that is? Why, that the sun turns\r\nover on its axis, as the earth does. But while the earth rotates once\r\nin twenty-four hours, it takes the huge sun about twenty-five days to\r\nturn around once.\r\n\r\nNot only is the sun turning over on its axis, but it has a great path\r\nalong which it travels in space, and as it goes on it draws with it\r\nall the planets and satellites of our system, each held in its proper\r\npath by the great force of the sun’s attraction. Thus we have learned\r\nthat from the sun these great globes, the planets, were thrown off into\r\nspace, by tangental force, and lest they should go too far away they\r\nare held in their paths by his strong attractive force.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Nature Reader, No. 3, pp. 40-42.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON X.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN OF THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n    “That orbèd maiden, with white fire laden,\r\n    Whom mortals call the moon,\r\n    Glides glimmering o’er my fleece-like flow,\r\n    By the midnight breezes strewn.”\r\n\r\n                       --SHELLEY, _The Cloud_.\r\n\r\nNo orb in the sky has attracted more attention than the moon. Beautiful\r\nnames have been given to this lesser light that rules the night,\r\nand poets have sung some of their sweetest songs, and artists have\r\npainted some of their finest pictures, to depict the wonderful charm\r\nof moonlight. The moon is in our minds associated with peace, silence,\r\nrest; the silver radiance causes no pain to the eyes, and like charity,\r\nwhile revealing objects, it adds to their beauty, and subdues defects.\r\nMuch that by the light of day seems harsh and ugly appears picturesque\r\nand fascinating in the delicate splendor of the moonlight. Of moonlight\r\nrather than sunset might the poet sing:--\r\n\r\n    “The splendor falls on castle walls\r\n      And snowy summits old in story,\r\n    The long light shakes across the lakes,\r\n      And the wild cataract leaps in glory.”\r\n\r\nThose nations who have worshipped the sun as god of the day, have\r\npaid similar worship to the moon as goddess of the night. The ancient\r\nmyths spoke of the moon as a pure and lonely maiden, fond of silence,\r\nhunting, and the forest shades. Increasing knowledge has shown us\r\nthe moon as neither goddess nor maiden, but as a satellite of the\r\nearth, from which many ages ago it was cast off into space, and by the\r\nattraction of which it is held as by invisible and unbreakable chains.\r\n\r\nBeing so much nearer to us than any other heavenly body, the moon was\r\none of the earliest and best understood, and to it, about two hundred\r\nand fifty years ago, the first telescopes were turned with eager\r\nexpectations of wonderful discoveries. The moon, at the nearest point\r\nin its orbit, is distant from us about two hundred and twenty-five\r\nthousand miles, only about twenty-eight times the diameter of the\r\nearth. Those travellers, who have again and again made the circuit of\r\nthe earth, have in the aggregate passed over a greater distance than\r\nlies between us and the moon. Steam could take us there in less than\r\na year; but if the man in the moon should begin to pelt stones at the\r\nearth, they would hit their mark in a little less than three days and\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\nShining large and fair in the heavens, the moon seems, as a queen, to\r\nlead forth the hosts of the stars, but if we watch its course each of\r\nthe twenty-seven days which it requires for its journey around the\r\nearth, we shall see that it continually falls behind the progress of\r\nthe shining hosts, and possesses a motion entirely independent of them.\r\nThe moon, like the earth, shines by the reflected light of the sun, and\r\nthis causes the lunar or moon phases. Thus sometimes we see the full\r\nmoon; then by slowly lessening degrees, which we call waning, we see\r\nthe half, and the quarter, and the little crescent, or octant. Then\r\nwe lose sight of the moon, and again it becomes visible as a slim\r\ncrescent, the hornèd moon it is called, and so waxes to the full. In\r\nthe circle which the moon describes about our earth, the moon passes\r\nbetween us and the sun once in about thirty days, and so presents us a\r\ndark side, which is called the new moon. In fifteen days more it is on\r\nthe opposite side of the earth from the sun, and shows us its entire\r\ndisk illuminated, which we call full moon; passing still about us, in\r\nfifteen days after full moon, having changed from full to gibbous,\r\nand to the third quarter, half, and second quarter, once more we are\r\npresented with the slim octant of the hornèd moon.\r\n\r\nGenerally the moon in its orbit passes a little above or below the disk\r\nof the sun, but sometimes it moves exactly across the face of the sun,\r\nand so occasions an eclipse of the sun. Again, sometimes the moon, as\r\nit passes behind the earth, comes within the cone of shadow cast by\r\nthe earth, and so an eclipse of the moon, either total or partial, is\r\ncaused.\r\n\r\nThere are many nights when we say “there is no moon.” We should not\r\nunderstand by this that the moon is not in the sky; the simple fact\r\nis that in the progression of its rising, the moon has come to a time\r\nwhen she moves during the day through the part of the heavens that is\r\nvisible to us. So sometimes toward sunset, we see the moon high in the\r\nsky, and during part of the day, when the nights are moonless, we see\r\nthe moon when not obscured by the greater light of the sun.\r\n\r\nIn all these various changes of its life, if we study the moon with\r\ntelescopes, we shall find it to be a globe, opaque, lit up by the sun,\r\nhaving mountains and valleys on its surface. Those dark lines and\r\nspots which with the naked eye we see on the full moon, are ranges\r\nof volcanic mountains. The surface of the moon has been mapped out\r\nby astronomers, who have given names to the various eminences and\r\ndepressions, and from a study of the moon much has been learned of\r\nplanets in general. For, while the moon is so small a body and has its\r\norbit around the earth, which is its centre of attraction, it is not\r\nto be considered as a mere satellite, but is to be respectfully ranked\r\namong the planets.\r\n\r\nThere have been many foolish myths about the moon: its ray has been\r\nconsidered poisonous to sleepers; the full moon has been regarded as\r\na source of disease and madness, and has been supposed to affect the\r\ngrowth of plants, the medicinal properties of herbs, and the fortunes\r\nof human lives. The moon owes all these slanders to its nearness to us.\r\n\r\nIn size the moon is about one-fourth the diameter of the earth, and\r\nits volume is but one-fiftieth that of our planet. The days and nights\r\nof the moon are not twelve hours long, but three hundred and sixty\r\nhours, equal, therefore, to fifteen of our twenty-four hour days. Only\r\na little more than one side, or face, of the moon is ever seen by us.\r\nThere have been many romantic fancies about what may be on the other\r\nside of the moon, but probably the side we do not see is very similar\r\nto the side which we do see.\r\n\r\nWhat is the past history of the moon? The first condition of any planet\r\nis that of burning vapor or gas, which must slowly cool and form a\r\nnucleus of solid or half-fluid matter. It is evident that the smaller\r\nthe planet the more rapidly it will cool and become solid, and the\r\ngreater the planet the longer it will remain in a partly fluid state.\r\nThus Jupiter and Saturn will require much longer time to cool than\r\nMercury or Venus. The sun, being by far the largest body in our system,\r\nwill be gaseous or semi-fluid long after all the planets which he cast\r\ninto space have cooled and hardened; while the moon, being one of the\r\nsmallest planets, hardened long before the great planets, and before\r\nthe earth. Thus the sun is still in the early stages of its existence,\r\nand the moon has run the course of its changes and is a burnt-out and\r\naged world.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the stages of moon-building were very like those of\r\nearth-building, with variations due to the much smaller size of the\r\nsphere. The nucleus would partially solidify, there would be a hardened\r\ncrust which at intervals would crush in from the withdrawal of interior\r\nmolten matter, or would be suddenly torn and flung up by the pressure\r\nof boiling lava from within. The condensing atmosphere no doubt sent\r\ndown water upon the moon, but by long degrees the heated volcanic\r\nsurface has parted with its seas, and we find the map of the moon now\r\npresenting us not with oceans, but empty sea-beds, volcano craters, and\r\nstrange and arid depressions.\r\n\r\nThe moon has no atmosphere; no rain falls on her barren surface; no\r\nclouds move above her; no tempests howl in her caverns; no snows crown\r\nher volcanic peaks; no sunsets shine in gorgeous colors; there are no\r\nviolet and crimson skies at dawn. The moon is the kingdom of eternal\r\ncalm, and sleep, and stillness. If any blow disturbs the lunar surface,\r\nit is from the fall of meteors rained upon it through space. It is\r\nto our atmosphere we owe the glories of the clouds, the beneficence\r\nof waters, the magic of frost changes, the rush of storms, the balmy\r\nbreezes, the sky.\r\n\r\nAs it has no seas and no air, it follows that the moon has no sky. The\r\nlovely blue we see above us, is merely caused by many miles of air, but\r\nfrom the moon one would merely look away into immensity; and day, and\r\nnight, sun, moon, stars, comets, and meteors could not be seen, while\r\ninstead of the lovely blue dome above us, where stars innumerable shine\r\nand tremble, space, as seen from the moon, is a perpetual, limitless,\r\nblack abyss.\r\n\r\nWe have found the moon destitute of both air and water; it is evident\r\nthat it is also destitute of all vegetation; in fact of all life. As\r\nthere is darkness above, so there is silence below. The moon is a\r\ndesert land where no foliage rustles, where no flowers bloom, where no\r\nbird builds or sings. No feet climb the lofty mountains, or explore\r\nthe gaping craters of moon-land. No voice causes an echo in the vast\r\nyawning caves that penetrate moon-mountains.\r\n\r\nA curious fact about these mountains in the moon is that they are\r\nannular or ring-shaped. They are skeleton mountains, burnt-out craters,\r\nmighty hollow cones thrust up, so that if one might climb to the top of\r\na moon-mountain, he could walk around the rim, as a fly walks around\r\nthe edge of a cup; or he could go down, down, down, on the inside to\r\nthe level of the plain from which he began his ascent.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the moon changes, not by the motions of life and growth,\r\nbut by a slow decay; for changes in the moon’s face are occasioned by\r\nthe crumbling of mountains and the falling down of lands. Thus we\r\nsee the moon to be a dumb, dead, deserted planet, wheeling on in its\r\norbit around the earth, and carried with the earth in its greater orbit\r\naround the sun. Silvery sweet and fair, this queen of the night is a\r\nplanet that long, long ago passed its childhood and its prime, and\r\nfell, in its old age, a prey to fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XI.\r\n\r\nVANISHED FAUNA.\r\n\r\n    “I said: ‘When first the world began\r\n    Young Nature through five cycles ran,\r\n    And on the sixth, she moulded--man.’”\r\n\r\n            --TENNYSON, _The Two Voices_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old fairy tales inform us of genii, and gnomes, and brownies that\r\nlive underground, and in rocks and caves, guarding treasures of gold\r\nand of gems. Let us fancy that there are truly genii and gnomes that\r\nhave lived from the time when life began until now.\r\n\r\nIn every passing age each country has had its peculiar forms of animal\r\nlife: these are called its fauna. The plant-life of an age or country\r\nis called its flora. As each age of earth-building came, it brought its\r\nespecial fauna and flora. As the age passed away, this plant and animal\r\nlife went away with it, and returned no more.\r\n\r\nBut from every age some form or type has lingered until now. The pretty\r\nlittle lamp shells of the China seas come from the far-off second\r\nperiod of world-building. Some of these forms that have lived through\r\nall the ages have changed much to suit the conditions of new times;\r\nothers have scarcely changed at all.\r\n\r\nAnd from all these periods, hidden in rocks and earth-beds, are frail\r\nremains of things that lived and perished long ago. Let us fancy that\r\ngnomes and genii keep these wonderful treasures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOST BEASTS.]\r\n\r\nIn the distribution of the plants and animals of past ages we read\r\nmuch of the earth’s history. For instance, when we find buried under\r\nthe later soil of England, the bones of elephants and hyenas, and the\r\nleaves and fruits of palms or other tropical plants, we decide, on\r\nreasonable grounds, that at some period the climate of England has\r\nbeen warmer than it is to-day. Similarly, when in layers above these\r\ntropical specimens we find the relics of an Arctic vegetation, and\r\nthe skeletons of elk and bears that belong only to polar or subpolar\r\nregions, we conclude that the days of tropical warmth in England were\r\nsucceeded by days of polar cold. Again, when we find under the warm\r\nplains of South France the remains of animals and vegetables now\r\nbelonging to Siberia, we say, “In former ages France had a reign of\r\nSiberian weather, for a period sufficiently long to permit the growth\r\nof Siberian plants and animals.”\r\n\r\nWhen we trace in regular succession the remains of such organisms back\r\nto the edge of the Polar circle, we say, “This northern cold, which\r\nonce dominated all the hemisphere, slowly retreated to its present\r\nlimits, and with it went its appropriate flora and fauna.” In all these\r\ninstances the animals afford better indications than the plants, for\r\nplants have less capability than animals of adjusting themselves to\r\nnew and untoward circumstances. If exposed to unusual cold or heat the\r\nplants die out, but many of the animals take thinner or thicker coats,\r\nto suit their new environment.\r\n\r\nVery nearly all the species of plants and animals belonging to the\r\nfive cycles of earth-building preceding our own have perished. No\r\ndoubt there were many of the early living organisms which disappeared\r\nand left no trace; the first ages may have been far more abundant in\r\nvarieties than we imagine them to have been. Many hundred of different\r\nfamilies have been found, and perhaps as many more flourished and\r\nutterly disappeared. We observe, concerning all these old-world\r\nfamilies, that when once they perished they are, as we say, “gone for\r\ngood”; a type does not disappear and reappear.\r\n\r\nAs one description of animals became extinct, another was ready to\r\ntake its place. This constant succession of animal types represents a\r\nconstant approach to those creatures best fitted to occupy the earth\r\nwith man. We have now on the earth large and destructive animals,\r\nas the rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the lion, tiger, alligator,\r\nboa-constrictor, and others, but all of these “are tamed, or have been\r\ntamed, of mankind,” and constantly recede before the advancing demands\r\nof the human race for territory.\r\n\r\nBut many of the earlier forms of life were so enormous and so\r\ndestructive, that man could by no possibility have debated with them\r\nthe empire of the globe. The battle would have gone the wrong way for\r\nman. It is well that various changes removed these creatures before man\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is here of great interest; the forms of life\r\nwhich survived their respective cycles, and came down nearly unchanged\r\nto our day, were not the strongest and largest creatures, apparently\r\nbest able to fight their battle and live; but many of the feebler and\r\nsmaller creatures, which, if we had been spectators of those ancient\r\ntimes, we should have expected to see perish under the encroachments of\r\nmonsters and dragons of their day. As, for instance, the large, strong,\r\nnumerous, armor-plated trilobites[22] of the second earth-age perished\r\nages ago, while the little lamp shells live on until now. Far back in\r\nthe reptile time, little mammal quadrupeds, scarcely larger than rats,\r\nran in the woods, and these types have been continued with various\r\nadaptations in the marsupial or pouched animals, like the opossum of\r\nour own day, while the vast scale-dressed giants have only left a few\r\nof their scattered bones to tell their story. The dragon-fly survives,\r\nvery like his ancestors of the Triassic period, while the mighty\r\npterodactyles,[23] a kind of reptile bat that pursued the dragon-flies\r\nas part of its prey, have gone never to return. The flying reptile\r\nhas left us only his enormous lithograph upon the ancient rocks,\r\nwhile still each year the jewel-like dragon-fly, once the big beast’s\r\ndefenceless prey, bursts his brown case, and comes forth informed with\r\nlight and life.[24] As the poet tells his story:--\r\n\r\n    “To-day I saw the dragon-fly\r\n    Come from the wells where he did lie,--\r\n\r\n    An inner impulse rent the veil,\r\n    Of his old husk; from head to tail\r\n    Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.\r\n\r\n    He dried his wings, like gauze they grew;\r\n    Thro’ copse and pastures wet with dew,\r\n    A living flash of light he flew.”\r\n\r\nWe should not forget that each one of the earth-building ages had some\r\nparticular form of animal life which seemed in that age to be king,\r\nand conquer the other animals. Also in its own age each of these forms\r\nreached its greatest strength and perfection. Then in after ages, when\r\nsome new type was dominant, the former types that still survived became\r\nsmaller and more feeble.\r\n\r\nWe have crabs and other crustacea now-a-days, but none so enormous\r\nas in the second world-building age when they first appeared. The\r\nmollusks,[25] which you call shell-fish,[26] were largest and most\r\nnumerous in the upper Silurian time. The sea-weeds that flourished\r\nwith these crabs and mollusks were larger and more splendid than any\r\nsea-weeds now, for this is the age of man, and grass, and corn, not of\r\ncrabs and sea-weeds.\r\n\r\nBefore man came into the world the woods and waters swarmed with\r\ngreat reptiles. There are none such now-a-days,--reptiles with long\r\nlegs, reptiles with wide wings! Shall we see what they were like?\r\nThe great objection to them is that they have such hard names. Among\r\ndistinguished examples of the “vanished fauna” was the lælaps, which\r\nfrom its relics we conclude to have been a ferocious land-lizard,\r\nfierce and huge; but as yet its form and habits have not been fully\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nWe know more of the reptile bat, a fellow-citizen of the lælaps, and\r\nwell-fitted to hold his own in the society of that grim monster, for to\r\nferocity and size it added the accomplishment of flight. Was it then\r\na bird? No; it was more like a bat. The largest pterodactyles found\r\nhave been discovered in Kansas, and the remains suggest animals perhaps\r\neighteen feet in extent of wing.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that the smaller forms of these creatures had teeth,\r\nand the larger ones were toothless. The legs and feet were very weak\r\nand had small claws. In our bats the tip of the wings has a claw,\r\nsharp and hooked; the pterodactyles seem to have had no claws on the\r\nwings. Some think that the bodies of these flying creatures were well\r\ncovered with scales, but there is no clear evidence of this fact. The\r\nupper-arm bone was of moderate length; the forearm, of about the same\r\nlength, had two bones, and had claws on the first three fingers, and\r\nthen the fourth finger stretched out to several feet in length and\r\nsustained the membrane that formed the wing. The flight must have been\r\njerky and uneven like that of bats. The famous roc, seen by Sinbad the\r\nsailor, fades into insignificance before this creature out of Nature’s\r\nwonder-book; and the great vulture of the Alps,[27] which carried off\r\nlambs and even babies, and is now happily extinct, must have been,\r\ncompared with the ancient reptile bat, a small and gentle flying thing.\r\n\r\nAnother wonderful family of animals that now-a-days exists only among\r\nthe rock treasures of the genii were the mosasaurs, whose nature and\r\nhabits were long subjects of dispute. Specimens of these creatures have\r\nbeen found over eighty feet long, with a skull more than a yard long,\r\nand the jaws set with strong, cone-shaped teeth. The trunk of this\r\nreptile was ribbed like that of a snake, and it possessed two pairs of\r\nwebbed feet, or paddles, to guide its course in the water. On land it\r\nmust have moved with the wave-like motions of a serpent. It was covered\r\nwith small scales, and was driven through the water by strokes of its\r\nmighty tail.\r\n\r\nNo animals perhaps are of more interest among the vanished forms than\r\nthe ancestors of the _horse_. We first trace it several ages before man\r\nappeared, as a small creature not larger than a fox, with four toes on\r\neach foot, and the rudiments of a fifth toe; it had also two bones in\r\nthe lower part of the leg. After this little creature came a horse-like\r\nanimal as large as a sheep, with only three toes, the middle one being\r\nmuch longer and broader than the others, while the two bones of the\r\nlower leg began to unite.\r\n\r\nThe next age shows us a horse as large as a Shetland pony; the two\r\nbones of the lower leg are merged into one; the big middle toe occupies\r\nnearly all of the foot. And finally, shortly before human beings came\r\ninto the world, we find a true horse. The big middle toe had come to\r\noccupy almost the whole foot. Its nail had enlarged and strengthened\r\nto a hoof. Thus we see that the horse really stands on the tip of a\r\nsingle toe of each foot. Meanwhile, as the lower leg and the foot thus\r\nmodified, the horse gained his present size, symmetry, beauty, and\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] For description of trilobite, see p. 119.\r\n\r\n[23] Pronounced _Ter-o-dak’-tils_.\r\n\r\n[24] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 43.\r\n\r\n[25] Nature Reader, No. 1, Lesson 34.\r\n\r\n[26] Nature Reader, No. 1, Lesson 34.\r\n\r\n[27] Nature Reader, No. 3, page 238.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XII.\r\n\r\nA MOUNTAIN OF FOSSILS.\r\n\r\n    “The bleakest rock, upon the loneliest heath,\r\n    Feels in its barrenness some touch of spring,\r\n    And in the April dew, or beam of May,\r\n    As moss and lichen freshen and revive.”\r\n\r\n                                      --BEAUMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach successive age of the world brought forth its children, nourished\r\nthem to their prime, accompanied them in the stages of their decay,\r\nand laid them in the tomb. Each new age rocked its cradles above the\r\ncemeteries of the age that had preceded it. Some sea-bed swarming with\r\ncorals and mollusks was slowly lifted; in the shallow waters, sand,\r\nchalk, or clay were deposited, and gradually formed thick beds above\r\nthe “swarmers,” which had suffocated in the mud, or, having lived out\r\ntheir span, had failed to reproduce their like. So in successive strata\r\nthe present surface of the world was built, and sometimes in throes of\r\nuplifting, some long-buried stratum was doubled upon itself, and having\r\nbeen thrust up through deposits lying above it, once more reached\r\nsunlight. But it spread out into the sunlight not living creatures, but\r\ntheir sepulchres.\r\n\r\nLet us now make a journey to one of the world’s wonderful graveyards.\r\nIt is, in the first instance, wonderful for its great age. Is it then\r\nthat acre on Coles’ Hill, sown with the graves of those who came in\r\nthe Mayflower, with sweet Rose Standish in their midst? No; that in\r\ncomparison is but of yesterday. Is it the graveyard at Battle Abbey,\r\nwhere, after the defeat of Harold the Saxon, Norman and Saxon lay down\r\ntogether in the peace of death? No; that in comparison is most modern.\r\nIs it the rock tombs of the Pharaohs before Moses? No; those tombs\r\ncompared with this graveyard are newest possible fashions. The dead\r\nPharaohs lie in their tombs in Egypt, with their servants and even the\r\nbeasts and birds of their day, all turned into mummies. These mummies\r\nare so hard that many thousands of them have been chopped up for fuel\r\nby the Egyptians. This is a queer use for dead kings!\r\n\r\nThe creatures laid in the burial-ground where we shall now go, are\r\nturned not into wood, but stone. I think I see the little genii and\r\ngnomes guarding them well through all the countless ages since they\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nCome then to this very ancient burial-ground. We trot briskly over a\r\nlong, level stretch of prairie land, and now our stout horses fall\r\nfrom trotting to walking slowly up the steep hill. The wheels grind on\r\nthe bare rocks; on the road-sides among the gray stones gleam patches\r\nof cinquefoil, blue-grass, and strawberry. Now the long faces of the\r\nhorses no longer front the ascent, but the sharp crest is reached, and\r\nthey look down upon the narrow valley into which the road suddenly\r\nfalls. Across the valley lifts another range of hills, and these\r\nare colored like a map of various countries, by the masses of white\r\ndog-wood, rosy red-bud, purple birch in its soft springtime haze, green\r\nof young maple leaves, and the gold, rose, and bronze of the unfolding\r\noak leaves.\r\n\r\nJust here, in the midst of this flowery beauty, the roving eye detects\r\non the road-side a gravestone with a well-cut inscription. Lo! here we\r\nare in one of the world’s most ancient burial-grounds. Here are the\r\nmonuments; here the mummy-cases; here are the unburied bones. We can\r\nscoop them up by handfuls. How old is this graveyard? Who can tell? How\r\nlong are the ages of geology? No doubt these dead were laid down here\r\nhundreds of thousands of years ago. Most ancient then is it not, and\r\nwell worthy of our visit?\r\n\r\nBut quite as wonderful as the antiquity of this graveyard is the place\r\nwhere we find it. Here we stand: nine hundred miles to the east of us,\r\nas the crow flies, the Atlantic surges beat upon the coast, and wear\r\naway and rebuild the boundaries of our land. Two thousand miles to the\r\nwest, lies the Pacific; nine hundred miles south, the Gulf of Mexico\r\nwarms the Gulf Stream in its sunny bosom. Three thousand miles to the\r\nnorth, the Arctic Ocean, which no keel has ever crossed, groans and\r\ngrowls under the ice-floes. Very far from the seas are we not? What\r\nstation could be more truly inland? And yet this graveyard is built up\r\nof corals and sea-shells and strange sea-creatures lie buried here.\r\n\r\nOver this height where we stand the waves have thundered. Here was “a\r\nyellow beach of sand”; here the busy coral polyp built its palaces up,\r\nup, up, from sea-bottom to sunshine. These are not pebbles crunching\r\nhere beneath our feet, but sea-shells, mollusks of the prime. This is\r\nthe burial-ground of fishes and of zoöphytes. Is not this burial-ground\r\nwonderful for its locality?\r\n\r\nAnd again it is wonderful for the distance which we must travel to\r\nfind it. What is that? Did we not come here in a carriage, driving\r\nover a few easy miles, in a May morning? Let us see about that. Let me\r\ntake you by the hand and lead you the real distance you must travel to\r\nreach this ancient burial-ground. Brace up your nerves, for we have to\r\njourney with the speed of thought, which is swifter even than light.\r\n\r\nOur starting-point is this modern age of the world, the age which has\r\nbrought forth grasses, palms, fruits, the higher mammals--man. Swiftly\r\nwe traverse this age, and leave its landmarks far behind us, as we pass\r\nthem with our faces set toward the old, old world. This modern age is\r\none of the five divisions of the Neozoic, or _new_ period. Through\r\nall the five we go, and at the gate of the one called the Eocene we\r\npass out from under the palm shadows, from the mammals ranging in the\r\nforests and feeding on the green savannahs, and now we are back in the\r\nmiddle time, the age of the reptiles. The forests are dark with cycads\r\nand pines. Crocodiles, alligators, salamanders of very old-fashioned\r\npatterns, swarm the brakes and the bayous. Rushing above our heads go\r\nskin-winged flying things, with the tails and hands of lizards, and\r\nthey crowd and cry about us for three ages more.\r\n\r\nWe must needs be brave as knights as we go back deeper still into\r\nmystery and antiquity, and by the door of the earliest reptilian age we\r\nfind our way into the longest of the epochs, the time with six ages,\r\nthe age which saw the coal-beds laid down and so many fossils locked up\r\nin rock--the Paleozoic[28] time.\r\n\r\nWe now find about us tree-ferns, club-mosses, reeds, calamites,\r\nlichens. There are fishes swarming in the warm seas; a few insects and\r\nspiders crawl among the ferns; here and there are toads, newts, and\r\nscorpions of curious patterns. One, two, three, four, five ages back\r\nwe wander, and now the mosses and pines, the fishes and reptiles have\r\ndisappeared, and we are in the age of sea-weeds and corals, crabs and\r\nmollusks, such as have few types in the modern world. And here, in the\r\nlower-Silurian, we have arrived at our ancient burial-ground. Have we\r\nnot come a long way to find it?\r\n\r\nIs there no shorter way to reach it? We have come here by the every-day\r\nstyle of a carriage over a few miles of plain and hill. We have come\r\nhere also by a dash in imagination through three great times and\r\nthirteen busy ages of world-building. We can take yet a third way.\r\nGo yonder to the valley and sink a shaft for seven hundred feet, and\r\nyou will pass through these ages and times and reach the era of this\r\nburial-ground. There it is hidden seven hundred feet deep; here it\r\ncrops out into the sunshine; here have been tumult and convulsion, and\r\nwhat in some places might be thousands of feet below the surface, is\r\nhere thrust up among modern methods, among apple trees, and bleating\r\nsheep, and white cottages, and little children at their play.\r\n\r\nThere is still another method of reaching this same burial-ground. Go\r\ninto the valley and wander five miles toward the mouth of the little\r\ncreek that divides it. As you touch its grassy bank you stand in the\r\nmodern age of the present earth-building time. As you travel down\r\nthe creek, the successive beds or stages of earth-building are laid\r\nbare, one after another, until at the end of five miles you stand on\r\nthe lower-Silurian stratum of this burial-ground. Take a pamphlet,\r\nfold the first leaf over one half, the next a little less, and so on\r\nfor thirteen pages, and you have a pattern of the manner in which the\r\nspring and autumn torrents flushing the brook have laid bare the rock\r\nstrata, and shown them as they lie here closely crowded upon each other.\r\n\r\nThis is, however, an unusual case, for each of these ages has in\r\nmany places left deposits thousands of feet in thickness. Here the\r\nuncovering has been rapid, deposit light, and we can turn over the\r\ngeologic pages in a volume a few hundreds of feet thick.\r\n\r\nAnd having reached this ancient burial-ground by all these various\r\nlines of travel, what do we find here? Stoop and gather a handful of\r\nthese little gray stones--small pebbles did you call them? The frost\r\nand rain of the past winter have washed away the sand and light soil\r\nwhich had hidden them. Why! these are shells, not pebbles. Stone\r\nshells, fossil shells! See how perfect every delicate fluting is, how\r\nsharply the hinge of the long-perished bivalve is defined. Some are of\r\na delicate pale gray, others almost white; but long ago in the Silurian\r\nseas perhaps they shone in brown and yellow, red, pink, buff, and\r\nmaroon, as gaily as the scallop shells of to-day, which in shape they\r\nmuch resemble.\r\n\r\nWhat is this lump of stone covered with little star-shaped knobs?\r\nTrace the lines along the side where it was broken from some larger\r\nfragment, and they seem to branch; is it like the veins on a leaf?\r\nNo; rather like the branches of coral, and in fact that is just what\r\nwe have found,--a lump of fossilized coral of the Silurian age. The\r\nlower-Silurian was the age when coral was king. When after the two\r\nearlier epochs with their meagre fauna the Silurian age opened,\r\nsuddenly the seas swarmed with life. They were warm tropic seas,\r\nwarmer than any on the globe to-day, and in them these industrious\r\ncoral-polyps built their towers. They built up from the sea-bottom to\r\nsunshine, and from each of these star-like towers a living creature\r\nunfurled itself like a flower, just beneath the surface of the sea.\r\nIn orange, scarlet, purple, white, and pink, they expanded their\r\ncoronals of filaments, and waved to and fro with the warm tides. No\r\nflower-garden ever bloomed more gorgeously than did these gardens\r\nof the sea in the Silurian age. Plume-like, fine as the stamens of\r\na flower, these myriads of living things leaned from the towers and\r\npalaces themselves had built, and drank and fished in these clear seas\r\nunder the glow of the sun.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile among and around about these coral towers, cuttle-fish and\r\nnautili darted, while mailed crustaceans chased each other, fought\r\nand frolicked and devoured each other. See, we have another fossil\r\nin the rock, the beautiful stone lilies; they must have a chapter to\r\nthemselves; and here again are lamp shells and other and different\r\nmollusks of the Silurian time. Here they were crowded, swimming and\r\nplaying in these living coral bowers. How they were dashed by thousands\r\nupon this beach of sand! And by and by when life was in its prime, what\r\nstrange mishaps overtook them all? Did the seas grow too hot or too\r\ncold? Did the bed of ocean rise? Did great sand-waves roll in among\r\nthe coral bowers? They had had their day, another age was drawing on;\r\nthere would be mollusks and crabs and crustaceans still, but these must\r\nperish and be locked up in this burial-ground. O gnomes and genii, keep\r\nyour treasures well!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] Pay-lee-o-zo-ic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN IN ROCKS.\r\n\r\n    “There rolls the deep where grew the tree,\r\n      O earth, what changes thou hast seen!\r\n      There where the long street roars, hath been\r\n    The eternal stillness of the sea.\r\n\r\n    “The hills are shadows, and they flow\r\n      From form to form, and nothing stands;\r\n      They melt like mist, these solid lands,\r\n    Like clouds they shape themselves and go.”\r\n\r\n                       --TENNYSON, _In Memoriam_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have been studying for some time about earth-building. We have\r\nlearned a little of how the rocks and the soil of our globe were\r\nformed. What is that study of earth-building called? It is called\r\nGe-ology, which means earth-lore or history, for the old Greeks called\r\nthe earth Ge, and ge-ology just means the story of earth-making.\r\n\r\nBut in these lessons we have been talking not of the rocks and\r\nearth-beds, but of the gnome-treasures hidden therein, the bones,\r\npatterns, stone images, burial cases of things that lived long ago.\r\nThis is a new study, and is a very important branch of geology; for\r\nunless we learn about these old organisms and understand what they tell\r\nus, we cannot well learn our geology. These fossils shut up in the\r\nrocks are the writings or pictures which keep the story of the long\r\nago. This study has been given the long name of Palæontology--it merely\r\nmeans the study or lore of fossils.\r\n\r\nBut pray what are fossils? We have heard much about them. What are\r\nthey? The word fossil really means a thing “dug up.” Once it was\r\napplied to any kind of mineral substance. Now we mean by fossil\r\norganized substances or their imprints, which have been preserved in\r\nany natural fashion, that is, not by the art of man, but by nature.\r\n\r\nThe study of fossils embraces the study of all forms, from the most\r\nancient here in the rocks of the Dawn, or first period, to those which\r\nmay have only been buried for a few score of years.\r\n\r\nThus you may see in a cabinet a bit of limestone full of ancient\r\nforaminiferæ, and near it a fossil clam from some bed in southern New\r\nJersey, which was producing living clams one or two hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nThe study of fossils does not assert any limit as to the grade of an\r\norganism. A fossil may be some large and curious fish, a rare bird, a\r\nbeautiful stone lily, or merely a lump of resin which long ago dropped\r\nfrom some tree of the coal period.\r\n\r\nSo also, we have fossil leaves, fruits, roots, fossil rain-marks,\r\nfossil footprints, fossil worm-casts and burrows, and little fossil\r\ncases of caddis-worms. Some very valuable fossils are called\r\ncoprolites; these are the droppings of digested or partly-digested food\r\nof animals, and they are valuable because they often contain traces or\r\nportions of plants or animals, upon which these other creatures fed,\r\nand which now would be entirely unknown unless preserved in this way.\r\n\r\nThe vulture has a habit of swallowing mice, little birds, and similar\r\nprey, with small ceremony of breaking or tearing; they go into the\r\nvulture’s maw feathers, fur, bones, and all. When fully gorged, the\r\nvulture sits in a meditative manner on a tree, and finally, in the\r\nprocess of digestion, the food parts of what it has eaten separates\r\nfrom the bone and feather refuse, and this latter is rolled into a ball\r\nand disgorged by the vulture. I have found such balls, probably a year\r\nor two old, bleached white and dry, and unrolling them have laid bare\r\ntiny skeletons, perfect, and white as ivory, of the feet and heads of\r\nmice. Now if mice had disappeared, it is evident that their skeletons,\r\nfound in portions in such remains would be valuable, affording us a\r\nknowledge of an otherwise unknown creature. So the coprolites tell us\r\ntheir tale of the smaller fauna of the ancient lands and oceans.\r\n\r\nThe term fossil is not limited to any especial method or state of\r\npreservation. In regard to preservation there are three principal\r\nvarieties of fossils. First: All or nearly all the animal matter may\r\nhave disappeared, and mineral matter may have taken its place; so that\r\nthe organism is mineralized or petrified. This is the condition of\r\nthe majority of fossils. Second: It may have happened that the entire\r\norganism has decayed, and as the animal matter when it perished was not\r\nrebuilt with mineral deposit, only a cast or natural lithograph of the\r\nformer living thing remains in the rock. Third: The animal or plant\r\nmay have been preserved unchanged for hundreds or thousands of years,\r\nso that the very creature, with its bones, flesh, hair, even the soft\r\nportions of the body, as the brain and eye-ball, may remain complete.\r\nThis has happened in a few instances, as where ice or frozen mud has\r\nbeen the preserving agent, so that in Siberia certain animals, as the\r\nmammoth, have been disentombed after a burial of thousands of years.\r\nOf course as soon as these frozen fossils have been exposed to air and\r\nmoisture, they begin to fall to pieces, and speedily only the hard\r\nparts, as the bones, are left.\r\n\r\nIn most animal fossils only the bony or shelly portions, which\r\nconsist largely of lime, have been petrified. Thus we find many\r\nfossil skeletons. Sometimes there has been a change on this wise: the\r\naction of water has carried off, grain by grain, the lime as well as\r\nthe animal matter of the organism, and while it thus took the object\r\nto pieces, it rebuilt it in a similar way, adding grain by grain of\r\nflinty matter, or even of metal, so that in countries where silver\r\nabounds, fossil plants have been found cased in silver. I have seen\r\nsome fossil bones of recent origin, as they were taken from an ancient\r\nburial-mound, and the marrow of the bones had been carried off by the\r\naction of water and replaced by delicate, shining crystals, so that the\r\nhollow or marrow portions of the bones shone as if filled with broken\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nThe chief agents in the decay of animal and plant organisms are air,\r\nrain-water, and atmospheric moisture, as dew, mist, and frost. We can\r\nsee the destructive effects of air in the case of canned meats or\r\nfruits. If the sealing of the can is imperfect, the air penetrates,\r\nand carries some germ which corrupts the contents. All the vegetable\r\nremains that cover the ground each autumn, do not accumulate year after\r\nyear, but speedily decay and become soil. The animals and insects,\r\nlarge and small, that die in the fields and woods each year, do not\r\nlong remain where they fell; carnivorous birds and small animals,\r\nespecially ants and beetles, devour the soft portions, and a few years\r\nof exposure to air and moisture reduce the bony skeletons to powder.\r\nAs the thing that is, is generally the thing that hath been, and shall\r\nbe, we may conclude that nearly all the animals and plants of each\r\nage perished with their age, and that what remain as fossils are but\r\na small fragment of the whole, and have been preserved in unusually\r\nfavorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nIce, as we have seen, has served as a wonderful preservative, but\r\nthe instances where animals or plants have been subjected to the\r\nice-process are naturally few. Next to ice, peat mosses have exhibited\r\nremarkable preserving qualities, and have kept entire remains, as deer,\r\nbison, oxen, buried in them. Heavy beasts becoming mired in the peat,\r\nhave sunk into it to a great depth, and were hermetically sealed from\r\nthe oxygen of the air, and from spores called _bacteria_[29] which\r\nare the chief agents of decay. Many fossil organisms are preserved\r\nin the silt or débris at the mouths of rivers, where the deposit of\r\nearthy matter carried down the stream is rapid, and speedily buries\r\nup whatever is dropped upon it. On the floors of lakes also, there\r\nare often deep deposits of marl, peat, and sand, and these sometimes\r\nbury and preserve the bodies of birds or other animals, and the seeds,\r\nbranches, or entire plants, that have been swept into the water.\r\nCaverns, especially those in limestone or chalk rock, have proved\r\nfamous treasure-houses of fossils. Where, in these caverns, there is\r\na dripping of water charged with lime or chalk, it speedily encloses\r\nobjects in a safe case which effectually preserves them. Sometimes also\r\nthese bone caves, ancient homes of wild beasts, have been closed up by\r\nsilt or earth-falls, and have retained many specimens of large, ancient\r\nfauna now extinct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONE IN STONE.]\r\n\r\nBut no place has proved so favorable for fossil remains as the bed\r\nof the sea. The rapid deposit of sediment on the ocean floor and the\r\nremoteness from changes of heat and cold, have made the old ocean beds,\r\nsuch as we visited in our mountain of fossils, a wonderful storehouse\r\nof the life-forms of distant ages. The mollusks, corals, and crinoids\r\nfurnish us the most varied and beautiful fossil remains, and in some\r\ncases the preservation is so perfect, that traces are retained of even\r\nthe former colorings of the shells of mollusks and the scales of fishes\r\nthat lived in the remotest times.\r\n\r\nThe grand march of life has been an ascending series, and for our\r\nknowledge of this line of ascent we are indebted to fossils, which tell\r\nin successive strata of the earth the history, not only of the changes\r\nin the earth’s crust, but of the animal and vegetable life of different\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nNo doubt only a very, very few of the fossils that are hidden in the\r\ntreasure-houses of earth and sea, have ever been found. There are\r\nmillions of strange and beautiful things that have never met mortal eye.\r\n\r\nLet us sleep and dream. Let us dream that we have built a great and\r\nsplendid museum, and lined it with shelves and cases. Let us dream that\r\nwe have found a ring that once belonged to King Solomon, which gives\r\nus power over all gnomes and genii. Let us dream that we open wide all\r\nthe doors and windows of our museum and stand in the midst and clap\r\nour hands, and command the genii and gnomes to bring us the treasures\r\nhidden in rock, sand, and sea, in lake and river and peat moss and\r\nearth beds.\r\n\r\nThey come! They come! They fly through the air, gnomes, pixies,\r\nafrites, fairies, genii, and they fill every shelf and case of our\r\nmuseum with fossil forms and pictured rocks and sands, and give us\r\nexamples of every animal and vegetable that lived so long ago. How\r\nrich and happy now are we! We wake: our dream has fled: the airy walls\r\nand shelves and cases of our museum are gone: the gnomes and their\r\nbrethren, the treasures untold, are vanished with our sleep. What\r\nhave we left? Nothing? Yes, the best that we can have; industry and\r\nobservation--these are better than the magic ring and seal of Solomon.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] Bac-tee-re-a.

The teacher, with\r\nhis head between his hands, looked steadfastly down. “What are you\r\nthinking of?” demanded a pupil.\r\n\r\n“I am reading,” said the teacher.\r\n\r\n“And what do you read? Is the rock your book?”\r\n\r\n“I read that this stratum of rock was once a beach of sand. It was just\r\nsuch sand as a child likes to play in; just such sand as it is fabled\r\nthat the Sibyl took in her hands when she asked long life of Apollo.”\r\n\r\n“And how did it become rock?”\r\n\r\n“You must know that all new rocks are made of the wear and tear of\r\nolder rocks, reconstituted and relaid. This sandstone was once sand,\r\nand the sand was chiefly tiny quartz crystals, the residue left after\r\nthe softer mineral portions of certain ground-up older rocks had been\r\ncarried away. These quartz crystals could not be melted, nor held in\r\nsolution by water; being heavy they could not be held in suspension by\r\nwater. So the water which was carrying about the rubbish of the older\r\nrocks, dropped the sand, and it formed long beaches, such as we see\r\nto-day. Observe that sand seems to be more plentiful than any other\r\nsubstance in the earth’s crust. Most soil is largely composed of it.\r\nIf it were not for the sand in the soil to keep its particles loose\r\nand allow the percolation of water, and the growth of roots, the soil\r\nwould soon become packed so heavily that almost nothing could grow.\r\nThe sea-shore, the river-beds, the great Sahara, are sand, sand, sand.\r\nAs sand is the most plentiful loose material in the earth now, so no\r\ndoubt it has always been, and we find that sandstone, namely, rock\r\nmade of sand, is the most abundant in the structure of the globe. The\r\ngrains of quartz themselves are naturally gray or white, but they are\r\ncovered with a film or crust which takes different hues from coloring\r\nmatter mixed with it. In iron regions the sandstone is red, and in\r\nanthracite coal regions the sandstone is dark gray or nearly black.\r\nOther sandstones are brown, yellow, or purple, according as they are\r\nmixed with other coloring matter.\r\n\r\n“But you asked me how the loose sand became rock. Understand that the\r\nmost important factor in the process was an indefinitely long time,\r\nwhile the agents required were very simple--great pressure and the\r\npresence of water. The water carrying with it silica, or some kindred\r\nmaterial, formed a cement about each grain, and thus aided by pressure\r\nand a certain amount of heat--for in this world nothing is done without\r\nheat--the individual grains were finally consolidated into massive\r\nrock.”\r\n\r\n“What else have you read?” asked other pupils, as they too began\r\nearnestly to contemplate the ledge of sandstone.\r\n\r\n“That was only the preface, or first chapter. I remember that the\r\ngrains of sand, composed largely of silica or tiny quartz crystals,\r\nwere heaped up here by water, which washed from the crystals and then\r\ncarried away, little particles of lighter matter, as mud. When I look\r\nat these long, gently sloping ledges of sandstone, I read that they\r\nwere once a beach. The ravine and the hills, the cornfields and the\r\nforests are now here, but once--the sea. Warm salt waters ebbed and\r\nflowed here, and shells were rolled up on this beach and were carried\r\nout again by the tides.”\r\n\r\n“Can you read any thing further?”\r\n\r\n“Yes: One day, long ago,--was it at the close of the Carboniferous or\r\nthe beginning of the Permian age?--there was a rain-storm here. It came\r\nup with a strong wind, from the south; the drops fell heavily, and were\r\nvery large. I think it must have been what we call a ‘black squall.’ It\r\nsoon passed, and the sun shone out hot.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, oh! now you are guessing at what might have been!”\r\n\r\n“Not at all. I am reading what really was. Are not these rocks my\r\nbooks? Look now at this ledge. Here is a thin layer of mud-rock, as\r\nwell as of sandstone. Here was some marl-mud laid down. I think that\r\nhere must have been an inlet. Observe here on this exposed surface,\r\nthese pits or dents. You can put your finger tip in them. See how they\r\nslant from the south, and how deeply they are driven into the sand.\r\nSuppose now that we stood by a low level beach of sand and marl-mud,\r\nand a sharp shower, driven by a strong wind, came up from the south,\r\nand the big rain-drops pelted violently on the sand and mud. Would they\r\nnot leave marks identical with these? So we know that here were big\r\nrain-drops from a southerly gust. We know that it was soon over; for\r\nif rain had fallen long, all the surface of the sand would have been\r\nwashed and saturated, and prints of individual drops would have been\r\nobliterated. We know that the shower was followed by a hot sun, and\r\nas the sun was very hot, we infer that the time was somewhere in the\r\nmiddle of the day, between ten and four, the time when the sun rays are\r\nmost powerful. We know that the sun was hot, because these rain-marks\r\ndried quickly, before they had time to lose the sharpness of their\r\nimprint. It is also evident that such delicate markings must have been\r\nquickly covered up, else the next heavy mist or drizzle of rain, or\r\ncreeping tide, would have smoothed them out. Therefore, I make a guess\r\nthat when the marks had dried hard, being sun-baked as some bricks are,\r\na strong breeze came up, sweeping sand before it, and so buried the\r\nprints under sufficient sand to protect them; or, possibly, a fresh\r\nlayer of ooze, or mud and sand mixed, came down the estuary and rolled\r\ngently over these rain-prints and cased them safely.”\r\n\r\n“Who would have thought of reading all that in sand!”\r\n\r\n“Do we not daily read footprints in sand in this fashion? As we came\r\nhere we crossed the road lying deep in summer dust. There in the dust\r\nwere the prints of a three-toed foot. We recognized the size and\r\nshape; it was the track of a hen’s foot; a large fat hen we judged,\r\nbecause the prints were large and deeply indented. Around her tracks\r\nwere the small delicate marks of the feet of young chicks. There were\r\nmany of them; evidently the hen had a large brood with her. Here she\r\nhad scratched in the dust where some grain or meal had been scattered:\r\nhere was a deep hollow where the dust was flirted about on all sides;\r\nthe hen had been taking a dust-bath. Here were some much larger marks\r\nof three-toed feet, their distance apart showing a longer stride: we\r\nfelt quite certain that a big rooster had marched that way. We knew\r\nabout the hen, the chicks, the cock, the feeding, the wallowing, as\r\nwell as if we had watched the birds themselves and their performances.\r\nBut we had only seen footprints in the sand. Has any one of us wondered\r\nat Robinson Crusoe’s conclusions when on the beach he found the print\r\nof a naked human foot?”\r\n\r\nThe pupils admitted the justice of this reasoning. “What else have you\r\nread?” they questioned.\r\n\r\n“Shortly after the shower an animal passed this way; a two-legged\r\nanimal with three-toed feet, and a stride six feet in length. Such\r\na creature would make an ostrich seem small. Whether it was a bird\r\nor a lizard I cannot tell, at all events it has neither kindred nor\r\ndescendants in the modern era. If a bird, it was of that antique type\r\nwhich had teeth and no feathers and wore a lizard’s tail. It was\r\nprobably a wader of some kind, and ate mollusks and fish. I say that\r\nit passed this way about the time of the shower, because I find its\r\nfootprints near the rain-marks, and on the same level of rock, and\r\nbecause they seem to have been covered up about the same time, and in\r\nthe same manner.”\r\n\r\n“Do you suppose if we broke up some of this rock we should find remains\r\nof the living creatures that moved over it?”\r\n\r\n“No; sandstone is not rich in fossils. Perhaps the oxide of iron\r\nthat frequently accompanies the sand has destroyed plant and animal\r\norganisms, or it may be that when the heavy quartz grains dropped out\r\nof the water, the plant and animal remains were carried off by tides\r\nor currents. Still, in some parts of the world fossils are found in\r\nsandstones.”\r\n\r\n“Do all the strata of sandstone tell this same story?”\r\n\r\n“Each varies the story somewhat to suit its own circumstances. Some\r\ntell us which way the tides flowed and the rivers ran that brought them\r\nto their resting places long ago.”\r\n\r\n“Are all sandstones alike, except in color?”\r\n\r\n“No; some sandstone, especially that lying near the surface of the\r\nground is soft, and the grains are loosely held together, and are large\r\nand distinct. Other sandstone has been pressed together into a mass\r\nnearly as hard as marble or granite. Flagstone is sandstone laid down\r\nin thin beds, and capable of being readily split into flags or slabs.\r\nFreestone is a soft sandstone which is capable of being readily cut in\r\nany direction; buhrstone is a particularly hard, rough sandstone, of\r\nwhich grindstones for mills are made. Roll yonder great, rough stone\r\nhere. What do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“It looks like plum-duff,” said one of the pupils, “only the plums are\r\nrather large and numerous, and the dough is very hard and scanty.”\r\n\r\n“It is conglomerate,” said the teacher, “and conglomerate differs from\r\nsandstone in the size of its grains. Where sandstone has tiny quartz\r\ncrystals for grains, conglomerate has pebbles, fastened together with\r\nmud hardened like cement. Coarse sandstone closely resembles fine\r\nconglomerate. Another kind of sandstone is called greywacke. Greywacke\r\noften exhibits the ripples and sun-cracks of the ancient beach. In\r\ngreywacke the grains are rounded, or nearly rounded, are uncolored, and\r\nare cemented together by a very hard paste of chalk or silica. If you\r\nlook at a piece of greywacke you might think it a portion of igneous or\r\nfire-made rock, it is so fine and hard. You must remember that rocks\r\nwhich have been--let us say, well cooked, by the earth’s internal\r\nfires, are very hard and compact; they have been fused together and\r\nthen cooled, and the process has made them very strongly coherent. But\r\nsandstone in all its varieties is a water-made, not a fire-made rock.\r\nThese water-made rocks are called fragmental, while fire-made rocks are\r\ntermed igneous. Whatever heat has been applied to sandstone has served\r\nonly to melt and harden the fine cement, but has not been sufficient\r\nto fuse the grains. The term fragmental, as applied to rocks, means\r\nthat the parts are easily divisible, and are largely individual and\r\nfragmentary. Clay rocks are fragmental, and so are limestone rocks.\r\nThere are also a few of the fragmental rocks which have been very\r\ngreatly heated, and indeed were once flung out of volcanoes in a\r\nred-hot or melted state. But as they are in a loose condition much\r\nlike cinder and ashes, they are classed among the fragmental rocks.\r\nAmong these are tufa, breccia, volcanic conglomerate, and two or three\r\nothers.”\r\n\r\n“It needs much learning to read so much from a few footprints in sand,”\r\nsaid one of the pupils, as they rose to go homeward.\r\n\r\n“Say, rather,” said the teacher, “that by close observation and by\r\ncomparison of observed facts, we may gather more or less valuable\r\ninformation. Pupils are too ready to depend for information rather\r\nupon memorizing what is in books than upon the cultivation of the\r\nfaculties of observation. Now, the books are very valuable as giving\r\nus the knowledge amassed by many minds, and also they help us to\r\nreason judiciously upon what we see. But the information gathered from\r\nbooks is much more easily forgotten than that which comes to us from\r\nobservation, and we must, in the study of natural science, yoke the\r\nbook to practical observation, and closet study to out-of-doors study.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XV.\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n      “Hark to that mighty crash!\r\n    The loosened ice-ridge breaks away--\r\n    Seaward the glittering mountain rides,\r\n    While down its green translucent sides\r\n      The foaming torrents dash.”\r\n\r\n                                 --BRYANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time the North Polar region, where all is now snow and\r\nice, intense cold and six months of night, was a land of warmth and\r\nsunshine. At that time, how long ago it was we cannot tell, the North\r\nPolar Circle was a green and luxuriant flower-garden. The beech, oak,\r\npoplar, maple, and walnut grew there. The fragrant lime tree and the\r\nbeautiful magnolia were there. Before this flora appeared, plants\r\nof the carboniferous era had flourished there,--pines, club-mosses,\r\ntree-ferns, cycads; and these had so abounded that a bed of coal thirty\r\nfeet thick was laid down. Over this buried coal-bed the spruce, pine,\r\nfir, birch, cypress, elm, hazel, and viburnum grew in the Arctic zone.\r\nThese trees were not the only representatives of the plant world; on\r\nthe plains the grasses grew, on the ponds the water-lilies rocked, and\r\nreeds and sedges fringed in dainty beauty the borders of the pools.\r\nMany families of plants then growing in northern Greenland had at the\r\nsame time their representatives in Central Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN ICE WAS KING.]\r\n\r\nEvidently at that date the Arctic zone had a mild climate, and day and\r\nnight of moderate length. That the above numerated plants and almost\r\ntwo hundred other species grew within nine degrees of the North Pole\r\nis proved by finding their remains in all stages of growth, from seed\r\nto matured plant, from root to fruit, scattered over an extensive area\r\nof country. How did this happen? What occasioned the change? How came\r\nGreenland then to be a warm and smiling land? These are questions to\r\nwhich no answer can at present be given. No one knows how this could\r\nhave been.\r\n\r\nOver against this marvel of a mild climate, luxuriant vegetation, and\r\nnearly equal days and nights within the Polar Circle, we may set that\r\nother wonder of the glacial or ice age--the time when the polar cold\r\nwandered beyond its bounds and came down into the temperate zone to\r\nstay, for how long we cannot tell; for very long indeed, no doubt,\r\nthough not for as long as a world-building epoch. The Glacial age was\r\nonly a portion of the age that came just before the human period. This\r\nGlacial period is also one of the problems which continue to puzzle\r\nthe geologist. Why was the Northern hemisphere then so cold? What\r\noccasioned the change from tropic warmth to nipping frost? How suddenly\r\ndid this change come on? How far did it extend, and how long did it\r\nlast? All these queries cannot be answered, but some of the wonders of\r\nthat strange, forbidding age we can unfold.\r\n\r\nWe know that the northern half of the world grew colder and colder, and\r\nthat in this chilling climate the flora and fauna greatly changed.\r\nThe plants could not accommodate themselves to the cold and most of\r\nthem perished, and their places were taken by flowers and trees which\r\nbelonged to colder climates. Instead of palms, figs, cinnamon trees,\r\nand magnolias, grew dwarf birch, the willow, and pines, while the less\r\nhardy vegetation left representatives only in the tropics. The animals\r\nalso changed, but more slowly than the plants. Some migrated to the\r\nsouth, others lessened in size and put on thicker coats of fur or\r\nfeathers; many species perished entirely.\r\n\r\nStill the cold increased. Vast snow fields loaded the Alps and the\r\nPyrenees, and all the plains and valleys of northern and middle Europe\r\nand North America began to be filled with glaciers.\r\n\r\nHere let us pause to consider that three-fourths of the surface of\r\nour globe is water. As we have seen from the study of the moon, a\r\nwaterless globe is also a lifeless globe, bereft of plant or animal,\r\nand we owe in a large part the habitable character of the earth to\r\nits abundant water. This water has many forms, as lakes, seas, ponds,\r\nsprings, rivers. It is salt and fresh, and varies in temperature from\r\nthe boiling springs or geysers, to the icy seas of the poles. Water\r\nhas changes of state; from the liquid form it changes by loss of heat\r\nto solid ice; moisture, frozen as it falls through the air, becomes\r\ncrystals of snow; water diffused in the air is mist and dew; partially\r\ncondensed in the air it forms clouds; and dew in a frozen state is\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what was the work of water in its forms of ice and snow\r\nin the Ice age. Here we do not wander in uncertainties; for what we\r\nsee to be now the work and changes of ice and snow in the High Alps\r\nand the frozen oceans of the north, we may accurately account to have\r\nbeen the work of the same agents in the Ice period. Let us therefore\r\nreason from the present to the past. A vast region such as Greenland\r\nor Spitzbergen or the high Alpine country is covered deep with snow,\r\nwhich falls upon it nearly every month in the year. For a little time\r\nin the summer the sun partially melts the snow even on the heights, so\r\nthat floods of snow-water begin to run into the valleys. But freezing\r\ngenerally takes place in the night, and the melting period is short,\r\nso that the higher plains and valleys become filled with beds of ice;\r\nyet from beneath some of these ice-beds water runs out and descends\r\nto the lower plains and valleys, becoming in their warmer temperature\r\nbroad rivers to water the land. As you look from the distance upon\r\nthe snow-covered Alps, you see broad spaces flashing and shining like\r\nsilver. These are the glaciers or ice-rivers between the snowy peaks.\r\n\r\nThese glaciers seem as you observe them to be stationary, but when\r\nthey are measured they are found to have a steady motion. Thus, you\r\nset a post in the glacier and a post in line with it upon the rocks\r\non each side of the glacier. Even in a day or two you will see that\r\ninstead of three posts in line, thus [Illustration] they stand in this\r\nfashion [Illustration], and in a few weeks the central post will seem\r\nto have travelled some distance down the glacier. But no; the glacier\r\nhas been sliding along in its bed and carrying the post with it. As\r\nthe glacier of the Alps moves down, down, down, it comes into warmer\r\nlevels, melts and crumbles away, and feeds rivers. But the glacier of\r\nthe Polar circle when it reaches the limit of its bed has not found a\r\nwarmer level; it breaks off by its own weight, with a tremendous crash,\r\nand falls into the Polar sea, among floes of moving ice. The fallen\r\nfragment of glacier settles into the water for about eight-ninths of\r\nits entire height, and now takes a new name,--it is an iceberg.\r\n\r\nThe iceberg is often of great height above water; some bergs weigh\r\nhundreds of millions of tons. The air, sun, and dashing water cut the\r\nberg into beautiful and fantastic shapes of domes, pinnacles, and\r\ntowers, from which the sun flashes back as from molten metal. The\r\niceberg floats about the Polar sea, and finally may be carried by the\r\ncurrents southward into warmer waters and a milder climate. Then the\r\nmelting process goes on swiftly, and when the lower portion becomes so\r\nmuch lessened as to destroy the equilibrium of the floating mountain,\r\nit turns over, or portions of it break away and fall into the sea.\r\nThus the history of the marvellous mountain of ice is: first snow\r\nfalling upon high lands; then from the melting and freezing of the\r\nsnow, glaciers or ice-rivers; then the glacier moving beyond its bed,\r\nbreaks off into a berg, and the vagrant of the Polar seas drifts to its\r\ndestruction in warmer climes.\r\n\r\nNow let us go back to the snow mountains and the forming glaciers. As\r\nthese rivers of ice grind and crowd down their ravines they tear and\r\ncrush the sides of the mountains and the face of the valley, so that\r\nthey have beneath them what we may call another stream, and that not of\r\nice, but of broken stones of all sizes. These are frozen to the bottom\r\nof the glacier and are dragged along with it as it slides down the\r\nravine. The bottom of the glacier moves a little more slowly[30] than\r\nthe surface; finally it comes down upon the valleys in something of the\r\nshape of a =V=, or the share of a plow. Thus entering the valley it\r\ndrives a vast amount of débris, as boulders and pebbles, before it, and\r\ncarries a vast amount more clinging to its upper and lower surfaces.\r\n\r\nNow it is evident that as the glacier melts rapidly in the warm valley\r\nit will drop the load of stone that it carried with it in its descent\r\nfrom the heights. Such a bed of glacier-driven stone is termed a\r\nmoraine, and when people have once seen a moraine they will not fail to\r\nrecognize one wherever they find it, even if it is thousands of miles\r\naway from any glaciers. They will say: “Here is a moraine; once there\r\nmust have been a glacier slowly moving here.” However warm the climate\r\nmay now be, when we see a moraine we may be assured that once it was\r\ncold enough for snow mountains and for glaciers. It is as certain as\r\nthat every peach-stone we see must once have been in a peach.\r\n\r\nAgain in the present glacier-districts we find that when glaciers and\r\nicebergs slide over beds of rock or masses of stone, they cut and\r\ngroove them, chisel them in a peculiar fashion; and when on any rock we\r\nfind these chisel-marks of the ice, they are unmistakable, and we know\r\nthat ice heavy and strong enough to cut the rock has been there. When\r\nwe see a name or initial cut in a tree we know that some person with a\r\nknife has been there and cut the letters. We recognize the glacier-work\r\njust as clearly on the rock as the human work on the tree.\r\n\r\nOnce more, to go back to our glaciers, we find that they tear from\r\nthe rocks large masses or lumps of stone; and these fragments being\r\nground and dragged in the ice-bed, lose the sharpness of their edges\r\nand become rounded and smooth. The icebergs, as they break from the\r\nglacier, carry away these stones frozen to their lower surface, and\r\nas the ice melts the stones are let fall. These peculiar stones are\r\ncalled boulders, and some name them “lost stones,” as they are found\r\nso far away from their original rocks. These boulders, or lost stones,\r\nare scattered over a large portion of the Northern hemisphere. On\r\nhigh hills,[31] in wide fields, and deep valleys, they lie as the ice\r\nleft them. Some are lodged in the most singular places. When we see\r\na boulder on the crest of some high hill it may be hard to believe\r\nthat once an icy sea rolled over such an eminence and covered it so\r\ndeep that icebergs with their enormous masses had rocked above it in\r\nthe cold, dark waves; but so it truly was. Sometimes we see a wide\r\nfield covered with boulders lying so closely together that very little\r\nvegetation can grow among them. In this field, long ago, some iceberg\r\ngrounded in the shallow waters and, melting away there, left its load\r\nof stones.\r\n\r\nThere are some geologists who consider that a solid cap or sheet of ice\r\ncovered nearly the whole of the Northern hemisphere at some distant\r\ntime, and that the boulders and boulder-clay were the deposit of this\r\nice-sheet, and were not dropped by floating bergs. It is very likely\r\nthat there were not only floating bergs carrying boulders, but also\r\nan ice-sheet extending below the Polar circle. Altogether the drift,\r\nthe moraines, the ice-scratched rocks, and the boulders lying solitary\r\nhundreds of miles from the rocks of which they once formed a part,\r\npoint out clearly to us what were the general features of the Glacial\r\nage of the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] The bottom of an ice-stream moves more slowly than the surface:\r\nthis is the case with any stream; thus the surface projects at last\r\nbeyond the bottom and breaks off in bergs; while at last the lower part\r\nenters the valley something like the share of a plow.\r\n\r\n[31] On the bluffs of the Missouri River, Howard County, Mo., are ice\r\nmarkings, and a lump of copper weighing 23-1/2 pounds was found on\r\nthese bluffs. This copper was a “lost” lump brought by ice from the\r\ncoast of Lake Superior.--J. B. S.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST CRUSTACEANS.\r\n\r\n    “Look on this beautiful world, and read the truth\r\n    In her fair page: see every season brings\r\n    New change to her of everlasting youth;\r\n    Still the green soil with joyous living things\r\n    Swarms, the wide air is full of joyous wings,\r\n    And myriads still, as happy, in the sleep\r\n    Of ocean’s azure gulf, and where he flings\r\n    The restless surge.”\r\n\r\n                                            --BRYANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn those long ages when there were no human beings in the world and\r\nthe lower orders of animals had the globe all to themselves, each\r\nsuccessive period of change was distinguished by some special class of\r\nliving creatures, which were then chief in numbers and importance. Each\r\nof these in its own age reached its prime in size and dominion. But\r\nwhile these particular families passed away at the close of their earth\r\nage, the classes to which they belonged frequently survived in changed\r\nforms, which have continued to the present. These late descendants of\r\nthe old time possessors of the world have generally decreased in size\r\nand numbers, and increased in beauty and in capacity for ministering in\r\nsome way to humanity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHILDREN OF THE DAWN.]\r\n\r\nBut there are some ancient classes of living creatures which have\r\nchanged very little, and are to-day practically what they were at their\r\norigin. Thus the foraminifera were among the very earliest of living\r\ncreatures, as they were also among the smallest, the most simple in\r\nstructure, and the most widely distributed. Their work seemed to be\r\nfirst to collect material from sea-water to build into their own\r\nforms, and then to bequeath themselves to the formation of rock. There\r\nis no family of creatures so ancient, for beside them all other fossils\r\nseem modern. As living animals they still survive in almost unchanged\r\nconditions, and abound everywhere except in the Polar seas. In the\r\ntropics they are found in shallower waters than in the temperate zones.\r\n\r\nThe hard name of these creatures comes from the word _foramen_, a\r\nlittle hole like the eye of a needle. Now these queer animals were made\r\nof a soft substance like jelly or glue in shells with many divisions.\r\nThe walls of the lime-cells or rooms were full of tiny holes like\r\nthe holes in a sieve, and through these the jelly part of the animal\r\npoured itself, and so filled and pervaded all the chambers or cells.\r\nMany of these creatures can be seen only through a microscope. In a\r\nformer lesson we spoke of the nummulites, large specimens of this\r\nsame order, and of their work in stone-making. We found that most of\r\nthe building-stone of Paris, vast beds of stone in India, and a large\r\npart of the chalk rocks are nummulitic. The great pyramids of Egypt\r\nand the enormous terraces upon which they stand are built of the same\r\nnummulitic limestone, while many other vast ledges of limestone rock\r\nare composed of the minute shells of foraminifera.\r\n\r\nIn most ancient times the coral polyps were building up their towers,\r\nand were perhaps larger and more plentiful in the lower Silurian age\r\nthan at any other period; but coral polyps are still busy on the\r\nPacific sea building their beautiful islands or atolls.\r\n\r\nThe mollusks, or shell-fish, with single or bivalve shells, with\r\nheads or without,[32] were, no doubt, larger and more abundant in the\r\nSilurian epoch than ever after; but they remain plentiful now, as all\r\ncollectors of shells are glad to realize, and though in many orders\r\nthey have decreased in size, they have increased in beauty of form and\r\ncoloring.\r\n\r\nThe crustaceans, or crab family, were among the earliest of living\r\ncreatures. The class survives in many varieties, but some of its\r\nearliest families have entirely perished. In the age in which they\r\nfirst appeared, the crustaceans were the most numerous of living\r\nthings. The crustaceans are of the ringed class of animals, to which\r\nalso insects belong,[33] and here we find that the ringed creatures of\r\nthe sea preceded by a long time the ringed creatures of the air and\r\nland; for crabs of many kinds crawled in the shallow seas and were\r\ncast upon the rocky shores of the earliest continents and islands long\r\nbefore a solitary dragon-fly or cockroach found life, or could have\r\nfound a wooded or grassy piece of land upon which to rest.\r\n\r\nThe first of the ancient crustaceans which we shall mention is\r\nrepresented by a very numerous class of fossils called trilobites.\r\nThere are no living trilobites, but the creatures now nearest them are\r\nthe isopods. The trilobite was more like an isopod in its larva state\r\nthan like a full-grown one. The trilobite had a hard plate or shell\r\nover his head and the front part of his body. This piece of armor was\r\nshaped nearly like the large front portion of the shell of a horseshoe\r\nor king-crab. The king-crab uses this shell as a mud-plough to plough\r\nits way through the slime, where it finds its food and deposits its\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nSome of the ancient trilobites were as small as a split pea, and some\r\nwere a foot across their head-plate; but large or small they all\r\nhad the head-shell and used it for the same purposes not only for\r\nprotection, but as a mud-plough for digging burrows in the ooze below\r\nthe shallow seas or on the shores. On the sides of this hard buckler\r\nwere placed the eyes, which were large, prominent, and compound, or\r\nfurnished with many lenses, as we find in the eyes of insects.[34]\r\nThese round, prominent eyes are a very marked feature of a fossil\r\ntrilobite; they seem to be staring at creation still, though the\r\ncreature has been dead thousands of years.\r\n\r\nThe body of the trilobite was composed of numerous rings or segments,\r\nand each of these rings was divided into three lobes, from which it\r\nreceives its name, tri-lobe-ite, or three-lobed animal. All the rings\r\nof the body were so joined that the trilobite could roll itself into\r\na ball, doubling its tail forward under its head, and so bringing\r\nall parts of its body under the protection of the horny shield. Have\r\nyou never, in turning over earth or breaking a decayed stump, found\r\nnumbers of small, oval, soft, gray, ridged creatures called slaters or\r\nwood-lice? Have you noticed how as soon as they are disturbed they roll\r\nthemselves into an apparently lifeless coil? In this fashion some of\r\nthe trilobites were like the wood-louse.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it was supposed that the trilobite had no legs; but at\r\nlast it was found that they had a number of small, thin-jointed legs,\r\nlike those of a young spider-crab. Thus we see that in its head-shield\r\nand eye-placement, the trilobite was like a horseshoe crab, or limulus,\r\nwhich is no doubt its near relation; in general form it was like a\r\nyoung isopod; in its method of rolling itself up for rest or safety,\r\nit was like a wood-louse; in its long, thin legs it was like a small\r\nspider-crab.\r\n\r\nDuring one earth-building age, the trilobite was the chief\r\nrepresentative of the crabs, and many hundred species of trilobites\r\nhave been discovered.\r\n\r\nWe find that their patterns varied much in the days when they were\r\nthe leading order of the earth. The track of the trilobite in the mud\r\nin which it lived was peculiar, and has gained the name of “ladder\r\nfootprints.” These footprints have been preserved in the hardened mud,\r\nas have rain-drop prints and birds’ tracks. The slim, sharp-toed feet\r\nof the trilobite made little rows of dots, and on each side of these\r\nwas a deep groove, the rows of dots looking like the rounds, and the\r\ngrooves like the sides of a ladder. This double groove was caused\r\nby the dragging edges of the shield or head-plate, and the ladder\r\nfootprint is much like the track of a king-crab.\r\n\r\nFloating above the primordial mud, in good fellowship no doubt with\r\nthe trilobite, was the brachiopod, or “arm-footed” creature. This\r\nname was given because of numerous slim finger-like appendages, such\r\nas the barnacle uses for its fishing apparatus.[35] The bra-chi-o-pod\r\nwas partly like the crustaceans and partly like the mollusks, while\r\nsome learned men have concluded it to be closely related to worms and\r\nstar-fish! In fact these ancient families of animals had many points in\r\ncommon. Perhaps the ancient lamp shells were the representatives of the\r\nbrachiopods when all these first families of the world lived together\r\nin the Cambrian seas.\r\n\r\nThe brachiopods had two valved shells of very lovely shapes. They were\r\na prophecy of the wonderful beauty that was to appear in the world.\r\nSome of the shells were only a quarter of an inch across, others were\r\nfour inches, and a few varieties have been found with shells a foot\r\nwide. These were giants of their class. The outer surface of these\r\nshells was exquisitely chiselled, as a jeweller ornaments gold and\r\nsilver plate, and the beauty of the shell was increased by brilliant\r\ncolors. Red, green, yellow, blue-black, and rose-pink were the hues\r\nin which these pretty creatures disported themselves before the big\r\nstaring eyes of the trilobites. Many of these animals moored themselves\r\nby peduncles to rocks or to other creatures, as barnacles do, and thus\r\nholding fast, they fished for their dinners with their fine net of\r\nfilaments; for these delicate threads were not for locomotion, but were\r\nmouth appendages to catch something to satisfy the creature’s hunger.\r\n\r\nThe brachiopods were, next to the trilobites, the most numerous and\r\nimportant group in the Cambrian age. But, while the trilobites died out\r\nwith their age, some of the representatives of their pretty neighbors\r\nhave existed ever since, and, no doubt, in the Silurian days they lived\r\nas contentedly among the corals, as they now live among coral groves\r\nin the South Pacific. Observation of a living animal of this class\r\nshows that having fastened itself by its peduncle to some firm holding\r\nplace, it can very rapidly fold and unfold its finger-like filaments,\r\ncreating around itself a little whirlpool, which inclines towards its\r\nmouth, and draws its food within reach.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] See Nature Reader, No. 1, Lessons 34-36.\r\n\r\n[33] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 1.\r\n\r\n[34] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 17.\r\n\r\n[35] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVII.\r\n\r\nSTONE FISH AND STONE LILIES.\r\n\r\n    “The floor is sand like the mountain drift,\r\n      And the pearl-shells spangle the flinty snow;\r\n    From coral rocks the sea-plants lift\r\n      Their boughs, where the tides and billows flow;\r\n    The water is calm and still below,\r\n      For the winds and waves are absent there,\r\n    And the sands are bright as the stars that glow\r\n      In the motionless fields of the upper air.”\r\n\r\n                      --PERCIVAL, _The Coral Grove_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not an unusual incident that a lawn gate should have been\r\ncarelessly left open, and, the gate being open, it was not surprising\r\nthat a stray cow should turn in thither to feast on blue grass.\r\nGiven the open gate and the intruding cow, it was in the usual order\r\nof affairs that Scroggins, our black boy, should arrive upon the\r\nscene, gesticulating and loudly remonstrant. Scroggins seized a large\r\nlump of hard clay and flung it at our neighbor’s Alderney, by way\r\nof emphasizing his objurgations. The cow was already hastening her\r\ndeparture, and the lumps of clay struck not the retreating cow, but\r\nthe granite horse-block, and so fell to pieces. At that instant I came\r\nby, and oh, joy! as the coarse matrix of clay crumbled, there fell out\r\nof it the most perfect crinoid, or stone lily, I had ever seen. White\r\nand clean, its sharp ridges, or folds, perfect, an inch of stem in good\r\npreservation--“Scroggins! Tell me quickly, where you found the clay\r\nwhich you have brought to level up that hollow in the lawn?” “I done\r\nfotch him from Hopkins’ quarry, missey. A clay bank jest clost along\r\nside dat quarry, suah.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE STONE LILIES.]\r\n\r\nVerily then there are fossil crinoids to be found in that quarry;\r\ntherefore let us take a hammer, and some one strong-armed to wield it,\r\nand away to Hopkins’ quarry. The rock of Hopkins’ quarry is of the\r\nlower Silurian. Here and there we search among the fragments torn out\r\nby blasting, and lo, plenty of portions of crinoids. The crinoid found\r\nin the clay had evidently been broken from the rock in some blast, and\r\nhad been flung over into the soft clay of the bank, which had hardened\r\nabout it. At last we carefully chisel from the rock a stem a foot long,\r\nand another fair, cup-shaped, fluted stone lily.\r\n\r\nAs the rock is cut away we indulge in some meditations on this\r\nbeautiful form of ancient life, the animal water-lilies of the olden\r\ntime. They came first in the lower Silurian, when coral was king, and\r\nin their enormous numbers they soon divided the empire of the sea\r\nwith the busy polyps. Moored to the sea-bottom, waving on their long\r\nflexible stems, as fleets of pond-lilies now ride at anchor, stretching\r\nout their plume-like arms, more like flowers than animals, grew the\r\nSilurian crinoids. A few of them now remain in the deep seas, but with\r\nthese few exceptions the crinoid has vanished from the living world,\r\nbut has left its representative descendants in the great order to which\r\nthe star-fish, sea-urchins, and sea-cucumbers belong.[36]\r\n\r\nThe adult crinoid of the Silurian was very like the larval comatula of\r\nthe present age.[37] The comatula is attached to a stalk that grows\r\nupon a rock or some other fixed substance, but at the age of six\r\nmonths the comatula detaches itself from this stalk and swims off. In\r\nthis it differs from the barnacle which, as you may remember, is free\r\nand vagrant as a larva, and attached when adult. The crinoids of the\r\nSilurian were always fastened and grew each in its individual place,\r\nas firmly as the lilies from which they take their name.\r\n\r\nThe stem of our crinoid as it is laid bare in the rock, exhibits a\r\nseries of little disks or plates. These are set one above the other\r\nto form the stem, which is often several feet long. Through all these\r\nlittle plates there ran a soft solid substance, like an elastic cord.\r\nAs the stone which holds the fossil is laid open by our chisel, and the\r\ncrinoid stem and flower-cup are well displayed, they remind us of the\r\nspinal column and brain of vertebrate animals. The great German scholar\r\nand poet, Goethe, remarked that the spinal marrow threaded through the\r\nclosely united vertebræ enters the skull by an opening at its base, and\r\nexpands, or blooms out, into the brain. Goethe considered this a growth\r\nlike a lily; the spinal cord being the stem, and the brain the perfect\r\nflower. This white stone lily looks like a prophecy in stone of the\r\nspinal cord and its brain expansion.\r\n\r\nWhen this crinoid was alive, these valves or petals, which now in\r\nthe petrified specimen form a solid cup, were capable of opening or\r\nunfolding, and from them the long feathery filaments spread forth.\r\nFollowing our crinoid down the ages have come all the marvellous\r\nfamilies of the radiates.\r\n\r\nIt has become a common form of speech to call nearly every animal that\r\nlives in the sea, a fish. Thus we speak of star-fish, meaning members\r\nof the radiate family which have nothing in common with true fishes,\r\nexcept the habit of living in water; we call mollusks shell-fish, but\r\nthey are very far removed in structure from the fish-class; also we\r\ncall whales, dugongs, and their kin, fish, when instead they belong\r\nto the mammals, as we shall find when we come to study them. These\r\nstar-fish, as we wrongly call them, belong to the same class as their\r\nancient forerunners the crinoids, and the crinoids were living with\r\nthe corals long before there were any fish in the ancient world. The\r\nSilurian period was almost at its close[38] before a single fish\r\nappeared in the swarming life of the ancient ocean.\r\n\r\nThe progress of life from its beginning until now has been upward,\r\nand in the main the latest forms of life are the highest forms; but\r\nthis is a rule which has many exceptions. We have seen many of the\r\nlowest and earliest forms of life continue living and reproducing\r\nthemselves in the present age, and also we have seen the many types\r\nof life remain which are not now in their highest development, but\r\nare degenerated examples of higher forms that existed long ago.\r\nThe noblest type of life is found in vertebrate animals; but the\r\nvertebrates have many families, and it is only when we finally reach\r\nthe chief class of vertebrates that we find the highest type of life.\r\nThe first vertebrates that appeared were fish. In their distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic, the backbone composed of many vertebræ, they were a\r\nprophecy of all the wonderful orders of vertebrate animals.\r\n\r\nThe fish were of several species, and had not sprung from any\r\npreceding type of animals. In their vertebrate construction they were\r\nsomething entirely new in animal life. The first fish of which we\r\nhave any knowledge were not poor little weaklings, hardly capable of\r\nmaintaining existence; on the contrary, they came bravely into a world\r\nswarming with great crustaceans and polyps and long-armed cuttle-fish,\r\nanother fish-named creature which is not at all a fish. Among these\r\nhuge and ravenous animals the new specimen held its own, and asserted\r\nits higher condition. When most of the great forms of life which had\r\nwitnessed its arrival had perished with the closing of the age, the\r\nfish continued into the next era, and there thrived exceedingly, and\r\nhad their turn at being world-masters. With each advancing age of the\r\nworld the fish-class has gone on increasing and reaching new forms of\r\nbeauty and excellence.\r\n\r\nThe crustaceans, polyps, crinoids, and nautili, which preceded the\r\nfish, had their bony structure upon the outside, and the soft parts of\r\nthe body securely placed within this covering. The fish came with its\r\nbones inside its body, thus depending for safety upon its agility and\r\nits teeth. The first fishes had thick, tough skins, without scales.\r\nTheir skeletons were rather of cartilage, or gristle, than of bone, but\r\ntheir spines were long, and their teeth were particularly large and\r\nstrong. They were about the size of a dog-fish,[39] and were probably\r\neven more hideous to behold.\r\n\r\nAmong these fish, however, and perhaps the oldest of them all, were\r\nsome that, while having no scales, wore great bony plates, like the\r\nside plates of a sturgeon.[40] From the coprolites found with these\r\nfossil fish we discover that they ate sea-snails, crinoids, which were\r\nunceremoniously bitten from their swaying slender stems, and lingulæ,\r\nwhich they tore off the submerged rocks, as cheerfully as a boy helps\r\nhimself to cherries or blackberries.\r\n\r\nThe first fragment of a fossil fish ever found, was in a bed of\r\nsandstone near Ludlow, England, and geologists have been eagerly\r\nsearching ever since for more complete specimens, and to discover,\r\nif possible, traces of fish in the earlier rocks. Finally the United\r\nStates Geological Survey has found earlier fish remains in Colorado.\r\nOne of the most ardent students of fossil fishes was the noble man of\r\nscience, Agassiz, who even as a young lad began a valuable collection\r\nof fish fossils. When we consider how many organisms must moulder\r\naway and perish entirely, for every one which survives, we need not\r\nwonder that comparatively few fossils have been found, but should\r\nrather wonder that so many have fallen into sufficiently favorable\r\ncircumstances to survive.\r\n\r\nWith the next age after the upper Silurian, fish became very abundant,\r\nand in that and every age succeeding, they predominate in the waters,\r\nwhere the older animal forms begin to disappear. One peculiarity about\r\nthe fossil fishes of the Devonian era is, that they are often found\r\nin hard, flattened, oblong concretions. When one of these lumps, like\r\npebbles, is given a smart tap with a hammer, it splits open, and a fish\r\nor part of a fish, is found in the centre. Hugh Miller, the Scotch\r\ngeologist, graphically describes in several of his works the joy with\r\nwhich he secured perfect specimens of fish from such pebbles. In\r\nthe Devonian age fish improved in fashion, and began to wear scales.\r\nSometimes fossil scales are found tinged with the beautiful iris-hues\r\nwhich they wore in the ancient waters. Sometimes in the rocks of this\r\nand the succeeding age there are found whole beds or thick strata of\r\nfish-fragments. When these beds are opened they give forth a faint\r\nodor, like decayed fish, but all the soft parts of the fish have been\r\ndestroyed long ago, and merely the bones, scales, and especially the\r\nwonderful teeth remain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lessons 37-40.\r\n\r\n[37] Nature Reader, No. 2, p. 127.\r\n\r\n[38] In the last months of 1890, fish remains were found in rocks at\r\nCañon City, Colorado, belonging to the first Silurian series.

Does any one say the arm, or\r\nleg, or breast-bone? No, it is the backbone, or spinal column. That is\r\na wonderful bone that gives the name of vertebrate or backboned animals\r\nto all creatures which possess it. This spinal column, or backbone, is\r\nmade up of a number of little bones or joints called vertebræ. These\r\nare threaded together like beads on a string. The spinal cord runs\r\nthrough them, enters the skull, and expands or blooms out into a brain.\r\nBend your body every way, backward, sidewise, forward, how flexible\r\nis this many-jointed spinal column! This wonderful backbone marked\r\nthe creatures that possessed it as a class higher than the jointed\r\ncreatures or articulates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REIGN OF THE PINE.]\r\n\r\nWe have found that the first vertebrate animals were fishes. The fish\r\nof the Devonian age were not only numerous and greedy, but instead of\r\nscales the majority of them wore large bony plates, which served them\r\nas armor while they fought, not merely for existence, but for conquest.\r\nAt present there are only about thirty species of plate-wearing or\r\nganoid fish in the world, and nine thousand species without this\r\nheavy armor. But in the age when fishes were kings of creation, this\r\nproportion was reversed, and the plate-wearing fish were the more\r\nnumerous. The fishes were the only representatives of the backboned\r\nanimals until the Coal age was well advanced. Then a new vertebrate\r\nof a still higher type arrived in the world. These new creatures aped\r\nthe fish in their backbones, or spinal columns, their thick skins, and\r\ntheir plate armor. But they were of a higher type than the fishes; for\r\nthey were in possession of legs, toed-feet, and had lungs instead of\r\ngills for a breathing apparatus.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest representatives of this higher stage of life, the lungs\r\nwere an air sac associated with gills, but the next form dropped the\r\ngills entirely, and had well-developed lungs. The possession of lungs\r\ngave them power to live out of the water, which hitherto had been the\r\nhome of nearly all living things. The new vertebrates were amphibians,\r\nand no doubt the earliest of them found themselves better fitted\r\nto live in the water than on the land, as their legs were feeble,\r\nand their strong tails served them well in swimming; but like the\r\namphibians of the present, they made themselves at home in any place.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles marked the introduction of a higher animal class than\r\nhad previously existed, and being of a higher type, their destiny was\r\nto live and thrive and assert themselves. Almost immediately we note\r\nin the class two branches, or fashions, which continue to distinguish\r\nthem. Some became very large, had enormous heads and jaws, and terrible\r\nteeth, resembling the present crocodiles. These, living on the shore,\r\npreyed upon fish or other animals. The second division comprised\r\nsmaller and more delicate reptiles. They had better developed limbs and\r\nlungs, large ribs, beautiful, brightly colored scales and skins, lived\r\non land, and fed on insects, spiders, and snails.\r\n\r\nThus in the latter part of the Coal-making age, we may imagine the\r\nshores and bayous swarming with great reptiles ten feet long, furnished\r\nwith thick armor and monstrous teeth; while the forests of tree-ferns,\r\nclub-mosses, reeds, and other plants, were rustling with the agile feet\r\nof gayly colored, active little beasts, from a few inches to a foot in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nHere at last was an animal with a pair of nostrils through which\r\nit could inflate a pair of lungs. The reptile with his improved\r\nbreathing apparatus and convenient feet had come into creation to\r\nstay. Individuals and families would indeed perish and leave only\r\nfossil remains to exhibit their characteristics, but the class was\r\nto remain. When the Coal period passed away, we find that the first\r\nlizards accommodated themselves in improved varieties, to the demands\r\nof the new time; their teeth, limbs, lungs, and tails, were better\r\ndeveloped, and they could claim to be highly organized creatures; in\r\nfact, the reptiles became the leading animals of the epoch, which from\r\nthem is often called the age of the reptiles. The crustaceans, corals,\r\nmollusks, and fish had had their day of being the rulers or leading\r\nfamilies of the world; now came the turn of the reptiles; while certain\r\ngroups, previously chief, sank into lower places.\r\n\r\nThese crustaceans, polyps, crinoids, and others which we have\r\nmentioned, were the predecessors of the reptiles. They did not\r\ndisappear when the reptiles arrived, nor have they disappeared yet. No\r\ndoubt all these creatures, and others which have come into existence,\r\nwill survive and share the globe, as long as the globe lasts. No\r\nresearches have discovered any animals created since the arrival in\r\nthe world of man.\r\n\r\nWhile the foraminifera, crabs, corals, mollusks, fish, and other\r\ncreatures came successively into the world of life, there is nothing to\r\nprove that any one class descended from the class preceding. There is\r\nno evidence that any mollusk, crinoid, or fish, though in existence a\r\nfew thousand years before the reptiles, could claim to be the reptiles’\r\ngrandfather, and there is no likelihood that the inside skeleton of\r\nthe backboned animal was developed out of the outside skeleton of the\r\nmollusk. We must take these successive classes as we find them: we\r\nsee each class in itself, developing into higher and better types;\r\nthen, some maintain this improved development, some dwindle away and\r\ndisappear.\r\n\r\nThere will always be many things in nature which we cannot understand,\r\nbut this need not discourage us in efforts to know; for the old saying\r\nis a good one--“He who grasps after a gold coat, is likely to get at\r\nleast a sleeve.” In those old ages before man arrived, there were new\r\nthings in the world. Since man came, there is nothing new under the\r\nsun: the facts which we learn and call new, are all old, very old.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles were of the improving classes of animals. To be in full\r\nharmony with their habitations, and not miss any of the possibilities\r\nof their kingdom, we find the reptiles accommodating themselves to the\r\nearth, the air, and the sea. There was, for instance, the hadrosaurus,\r\na two-legged reptile, which had long, strong hind legs, and a strong,\r\npointed tail. These legs and the tail formed a tripod, like the three\r\nlegs of a milking-stool, or the two legs and cane whereon an aged man\r\nsupports himself. The enormous body of the hadrosaurus was upheld by\r\nthe strong hind legs, and it paced slowly about: then when it wished\r\nto rest, or seat itself at ease, while with its small, hand-like\r\nfore-paws, it picked fruits and leaves from the tree-tops, it brought\r\nits strong tail into play, and rested on this and its legs. Thus we see\r\nthe lucky hadrosaurus always carried about its own camp-stool. This\r\ncreature was a land-living, herb-eating reptile.\r\n\r\nOne very great reptile of the sea was the ichthyosaur, or fish reptile.\r\nThis creature had paddles and a very strong tail-fin for swimming. The\r\nichthyosaur could roll in the heavy billows like a porpoise, and liked\r\nto be far out on the sea busy at fishing. As it chased fish at sea, it\r\nheld its head high above the water and breathed air with true lungs.\r\nProbably no fish could hold its own against a monster twenty-five feet\r\nlong and protected by broad, solid plates of armor. The empire of the\r\nfish had finally departed.\r\n\r\nA third wonderful reptilian form was fitted for airy flights; the\r\npterodactyl was the reptile monarch of the air. While its cousins, the\r\nbiped reptile and the fish reptile, were ravaging the land and sea,\r\nthe flying reptile, or bat reptile, whichever we choose to call it,\r\nspread its parchment-like wings, lifted itself far above the trees,\r\nand swooped from its height upon fish, land animals, or the few stray\r\ninsects of the period. The flying reptile was a prophecy of the coming\r\nbird, which arrived in the middle part of this period.\r\n\r\nWhen true birds came, they introduced a class that was very closely\r\nrelated to the reptiles. The lady who holds a pet canary on her\r\nfinger, offers it sugar with her lips, kisses its pretty yellow head,\r\nand considers it one of the most dainty and delightful of living things\r\nwould, perhaps, shriek wildly if a lizard ran across her foot, or\r\nupon her sleeve, and would call the innocent little reptile, hideous,\r\ndisgusting, hateful. Some one says the bird is a “glorified reptile.”\r\nThere is similarity of structure, but the bird class is not descended\r\nfrom the reptile class.\r\n\r\nThe backboned animals are divided into the class of the fishes; the\r\namphibians; the sauropsida, or class containing birds and reptiles,\r\nwhich you see are put together; and the highest class of all--the\r\nmammalians--to which we ourselves belong.\r\n\r\nSome years ago it was usual to class together as “four-legged creatures\r\nthat lay eggs,” all turtles, tortoises, newts, salamanders, snakes,\r\ntoads, frogs, lizards, and crocodiles. The great naturalist, Linnæus,\r\nnamed all these creatures amphibia, because they can live with equal\r\nease in the water or on the land. After this some of the French\r\nnaturalists concluded that the creeping method of locomotion of these\r\nanimals was a more general characteristic than their amphibious habit,\r\nand called them reptiles, or crawling creatures. But as these animals\r\nhave been more closely studied, wider differences have been noted\r\nbetween them, and the toads, frogs, newts, and salamanders have been\r\nset in a class by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe study of nearly all forms of life has two branches, the\r\ninvestigation of living objects, and the similar investigation and\r\nclassification of fossil specimens. Thus the study of fishes embraces\r\nnot only the examination of those species now to be found in the\r\nwaters of the world, but of the fossil fish found whole or in parts,\r\nin the treasure-house of the rocks, and these fossil fish have very\r\nnumerous varieties. Botany also regards not only plants now growing,\r\nbut the varieties which have become extinct, during the five earlier\r\nearth-building periods. Of the ten orders into which it is common among\r\nscientists to divide reptiles, five are now extinct, and remain to us\r\nonly as fossils. But so learned and accurate do some ardent students of\r\nfossil remains become, that from only a single bone, tooth, or scale,\r\nthey are able to decide to what class and family the creature of which\r\nit was a part belonged, provided, of course, that the creature itself\r\nhas become known.\r\n\r\nNo ancient creature seems to have accommodated itself more closely\r\nto its circumstances than the reptile. It appeared to be equally at\r\nhome in the water, on land, or in the air; it ate fish, flesh, and\r\nvegetables; walked on two legs, or crawled on four. The biped land\r\nreptile had many of the characteristics of the present kangaroo; the\r\nbat reptile had many of the qualities of a bird; and the sea reptile\r\nwas probably more like a whale than a fish. In fact the reptile seems\r\nto have been as complaisant as Polonius the courtier-friend of Prince\r\nHamlet in Shakespeare’s play.\r\n\r\nLet us now write out a little table for reference, showing the\r\nimproving scale of life in plants and animals, from their first\r\nappearance until the reptiles came.\r\n\r\nANIMALS.\r\n\r\n  Amoeba.\r\n  Foraminifera.\r\n  Crustaceans.\r\n  Polyps.\r\n  Mollusks.\r\n  Fishes.\r\n  Amphibia.\r\n  Reptiles.\r\n  Crinoids.\r\n  Spiders.\r\n  Scorpions.\r\n  Dragon-flies.\r\n  Cockroaches.\r\n  Kangaroo-rats.\r\n\r\nPLANTS.\r\n\r\n  Sea-weeds.\r\n  Mosses.\r\n  Ferns.\r\n  Reeds.\r\n  Pines.\r\n  Cycads.\r\n\r\nThe amphibia and reptiles brought into the world not only those famous\r\nbackbones, but lungs and noses. The amphibia had at first gills and\r\nlung-sacs, but the reptiles had true lungs and drew air through their\r\nnostrils. Try it: draw in your breath and fill your lungs until your\r\nchest rises and expands; now breathe it forth again. Very simple that,\r\ndo you say? So it seems; it is very common now-a-days, but there were\r\nmany ages when not a living creature had a pair of lungs and a pair of\r\nnostrils, when such breathing apparatus would have been a marvellous\r\naffair. These reptiles introduced a brand-new fashion.\r\n\r\nEach advancing age was richer in both flora and fauna than the ages\r\nthat had preceded it, because the soil, climate, and atmosphere of\r\nthe earth became more and more favorable to both animal and vegetable\r\nexistence. Nothing in all this succession lived or died in vain. The\r\nplants freed the air of carbon and enriched it with oxygen;[41] the\r\ndecay of animal and vegetable matter increased and enriched the soil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] Nature Reader, No. 3, Lessons 6, 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRDS OF OTHER DAYS.\r\n\r\n      “Thy flitting form comes ghostly dim and pale,\r\n      As driven by a beating storm at sea;\r\n    Thy cry is weak and scared, as if thy mates had shared\r\n    The doom of us: thy wail--what does it bring to me?”\r\n\r\n                                                  --DANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD FASHIONS IN FEATHERS.]\r\n\r\nIt was an often-repeated saying of the great Linnæus that “Nature\r\nnever makes a leap.” By this he meant that the law of nature is a law\r\nof gradations, and that in the long up-growth of organisms, the steps\r\nare short between the various classes of living things. The work of\r\ncreation is harmonious, and moves from one grade of organization to\r\nanother, with the easy transition of carefully shaded colors, or the\r\nascent of the scale from note to note. But this creative harmony began\r\nvery long ago, and in the innumerable ages which have rolled by with\r\ntheir train of living things, many types have been lost. Enough remain\r\nto fill us with wonder and admiration, when we see how the organism\r\nof one creature has been changed and adapted in some other succeeding\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nWe quoted in the last lesson the remark, “a bird is but a glorified\r\nreptile”; and, far apart in type as we might at first glance consider\r\nan eagle and a crocodile, or a lizard and a dove, it is not very\r\ndifficult to trace, by the help of fossil forms, the similarity of\r\norganism and the steps in the process of change. Reptiles and birds\r\nbelong to the class vertebrates; the backbone is then the first\r\ndistinguishing feature. In the reptile, the spinal column with\r\nwell-defined vertebræ passes from the head to the tail.[42] In the bird\r\nwe find the vertebræ of the neck well marked, and more numerous than in\r\nthe reptile; the shoulder-plates, breast-bone and hip-bones are largely\r\ndeveloped, forming the box-like body of the bird, and embracing the\r\nbackbone. In a similar fashion we often find certain insects in which\r\none of the rings of which the jointed body is composed is developed far\r\nmore than any of the others.\r\n\r\nIn the tail of the bird, we find the vertebræ flattened and crowded\r\ntogether into a triangular stump, while the tail of the reptile is\r\nextended, pointed, and supple. The reptile has four limbs; in the bird\r\nthe two front limbs--the hands of the reptile--are changed to wings.\r\nThe long-toothed jaws of the reptile become the horny beak of the bird.\r\nThe reptile has scales and the bird has feathers, but there are spots\r\non the reptile bare of scales, and on the bird bare of feathers.[43]\r\n\r\nThe sea had its inhabitants long before the land was populated, and\r\nthe first vertebrates, the fish, were citizens of the sea. Before the\r\nearliest reptiles came, there were amphibians, which lived more readily\r\nin the water than on the land; then followed land reptiles, and finally\r\nflying reptiles. In like manner, the first birds were chiefly aquatic\r\nor swimming birds; then came huge, unwieldy walking birds, and finally\r\nflying birds. The earliest birds also diminish the distance between\r\nthemselves and the reptiles, by the possession of teeth. In regard to\r\nfeathers, we find that the plumage of the first birds was coarse and\r\nscanty, and consisted chiefly of quill feathers. The legs of all birds\r\nare covered with true scales such as the reptiles have.[44]\r\n\r\nWhen we look at the reptile and the bird, the differences that seem\r\nmost startling are between the wings of the bird and the fore-feet of\r\nthe reptile, and between the scales of the reptile and the feathers\r\nof the bird. When we find the fossil form of one of the first flying\r\ncreatures, we see that the huge wings were made of parchment-like skin,\r\nstretched upon the arm and fourth finger, which extended in claws in\r\nfront of the membrane. If we examine that curious flying mammal, the\r\nbat, we shall see a similar construction, one finger of the bat’s\r\nfore-leg extending beyond the wing into a hooked claw, by which it can\r\nhang itself up for rest, or upon which it can walk, going on all fours,\r\nin a clumsy fashion.\r\n\r\nNow, if we take the bones of a bird’s wing, we shall find that it has\r\na large, thick upper bone, corresponding to the upper bone in our\r\nown arm; then the next section has two smaller bones, one slightly\r\ncurved and one straight, to match the bones in our arm from the elbow\r\nto the wrist; and then in that small, pointed first section, we find\r\nthree finger-bones. If we lay all these bones in their order we shall\r\nfind a very good arm and hand. But now take these bones and construct\r\nfrom them a leg, and we shall notice that any arm is a modified and\r\nreduced leg. In nearly all animals the fore-legs are smaller and more\r\nsymmetrical than the hind-legs. In the reptile family the fore-leg\r\nlooks very like an arm and hand.\r\n\r\nTo return to the case of the bird and the reptile, we find that the\r\nfirst bird-like flying creatures, were not birds but reptiles of a\r\nbat-like construction; while the first biped creatures, supposed from\r\ntheir footprints to be birds, were not birds but biped reptiles. An\r\nenormous space of time separated biped reptiles from real birds.\r\n\r\nThe remains of the earliest birds seem to have been less well\r\ncircumstanced for preservation than those of other animals, for very\r\nfew are found; and of the first animal that can really be called a\r\nbird, for many years only part of a single specimen, and that lacking\r\nnearly all the head and breast-bone, was known. Enough, however, of\r\nthe specimen remained stamped on the Bavarian slate to show that this\r\nhad been a feathered flying creature, with two slender legs, and feet\r\nsuitable for perching upon trees. It was of about the size of a crow,\r\nand had a very singular tail. This tail was long and formed of extended\r\nvertebræ like the tail of a lizard, and from every joint grew a pair of\r\nlarge quill feathers.\r\n\r\nSuch a tail must have greatly hindered the creature’s flight, and in\r\nfact in the many years that passed before the existence of the next\r\nbirds of which fossil forms remain, a new fashion of tails had come in;\r\nthe huge court-train had vanished, and birds appeared with the closely\r\ncrowded vertebræ of the tail, only sufficient to support the tail\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nBut the print on Bavarian slate is not the only fossil of our\r\nlong-tailed bird of early days. A feather was also found imprinted on\r\nstone, and then about 1880, a very complete specimen, showing that the\r\njaws had teeth, and that the bird had claws. “A fearsome fowl, surely!”\r\n\r\nThe bird next found was aquatic, about the size of the nearly extinct\r\npenguin, but wingless. In the chalk shale of Kansas, birds of the size\r\nof pigeons, with short wings, but especially remarkable for having\r\nteeth in the old reptile fashion, have been found. Modern birds have\r\nlost their teeth, finding it more convenient to depend upon gizzards\r\nfor crushing their food! A bird very nearly the size of a swan has been\r\ntaken from the New Jersey marl.\r\n\r\nIt is only when the first age of the last world-building period opened,\r\nthat we find a huge bird as large as an ostrich. This bird was not\r\nalone as a giant of the race; there seem to have been other species,\r\ntoo bulky to fly, but able to swim, and no doubt capable of running\r\nswiftly on land, aided by the rowing motion of their wings.\r\n\r\nAs the ages move on, more birds appear, having affinities with yet\r\nexisting types. In some, the jaws had bony points and serrated edges,\r\nshowing that the birds were fish-eaters, aquatic in their habits, and\r\npossessed of webbed feet. Birds allied to the gulls and kingfishers\r\nwere numerous, and shortly after them came specimens of the flamingo\r\ntribe; and still we see that the aquatic birds, the birds that had\r\ntheir living from the all-bountiful sea, were most numerous.\r\n\r\nIt must not be concluded that of all these birds perfect specimens have\r\nbeen found. In some cases eggs, feathers, nests, footprints, or stray\r\nbones have been the only traces. The extinct bird frequently has had\r\nto be reconstructed from small portions of its body. Each succeeding\r\nage of the last world-building period has produced new birds. In France\r\nthe strata from the first age of this period have yielded many species.\r\nThe ancient beds of lakes have been especially rich in bird remains, as\r\nlying in the undisturbed ooze, the fragile bodies were less exposed to\r\ndestruction. Very many of these birds of ancient days represented forms\r\nnow living,--as barn-yard fowls, storks, woodcock, crows, and falcons.\r\nPossibly the birds were not more numerous in the Miocene than in the\r\nsucceeding age, but its numerous lake beds, and other circumstances may\r\nhave been more favorable to the preservation of the remains.\r\n\r\nA great many fossil birds and remains of birds have been found in\r\nthe caves of the succeeding eras. Many varieties of birds are still\r\ngiven to inhabiting caves, or any quiet and shady place. No doubt\r\n“the temple haunting martlet” haunted caves before temples were built,\r\nand swallows that now multiply in chimneys and eaves must have gone\r\nfor shelter to the crevices of the rocks in ages before men displayed\r\narchitectural talent. Thus the caves of the ancient world had numerous\r\nbird inhabitants, while the captured bodies of birds were no doubt\r\ncarried to their cave-dens by carnivorous animals.\r\n\r\nThe division of “sub-fossil birds” embraces birds that have existed\r\nduring the human period, but have now disappeared. In what are called\r\nthe “kitchen-middens”[45] of Denmark, and in the lake dwellings of\r\nSwitzerland, in recent fens and peat mosses, and in various islands,\r\nas Madagascar, New Zealand, and the Canaries, the remains of the great\r\nauk, the capercallzie, the dodo, the crested parrot, and in New Zealand\r\nthe huge dinornis have been found. Within the historic period various\r\nother birds have been exterminated, and are now represented only by\r\nancient drawings, stuffed skins, or relics of their nests and eggs.[46]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] These differential characteristics apply only to existing species\r\nof birds and reptiles.\r\n\r\n[43] See Nature Reader, No. 3, Lessons 28-30.\r\n\r\n[44] This adaptation does not indicate any descent of the bird from the\r\nreptile.\r\n\r\n[45] The word means “kitchen refuse heap” and is applied to shell-heaps\r\nmingled with bones, found along shores and recognized as traces of\r\nancient human habitations.\r\n\r\n[46] See Nature Reader, No. 3, Lesson 39.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XX.\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY MAMMALS.\r\n\r\n    “’Tis there the otter dives, the beaver feeds,\r\n    Where pensive osiers dip their willowy weeds,\r\n    And there the wild-cat purrs amid her brood,\r\n    And trains them in the sylvan solitude,\r\n    To watch the squirrels leap, or mark the mink\r\n    Paddling the water by the quiet brink.”\r\n\r\n                                      --BRAINARD.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMPANIONS AND FRIENDS.]\r\n\r\nThe last nine lessons have been occupied with brief descriptions of\r\nsome of the fauna of the first five world-building periods. A knowledge\r\nof these early forms of life is not only pleasing in itself, but\r\nvaluable, as giving us clearer ideas of the past ages, and because the\r\nanimals and plants that then existed have a close relationship to those\r\nof our own day.\r\n\r\nThe earliest animals described were the foraminifera, from which class\r\nwe have our most ancient fossils. We might infer from this fact that\r\nthe foraminifera were the first forms of animal life. But no; even\r\nthese had predecessors, but of groups from which no fossils remain.\r\n\r\nThe foraminifera, minute as they were, had shells. There is no doubt\r\nthat they were preceded in the scale of creation by tiny creatures\r\nwithout shells, creatures that with neither arms nor legs, heads nor\r\nstomachs, yet could provide themselves with arms in an emergency, and\r\nwere all mouth and stomach. Such an animal has been named a proteus\r\nfrom its constant changes of shape, Proteus in the classic fable being\r\na sea-god who was constantly changing his form.\r\n\r\nThe amœba, or proteus, belonged to the class protozoa, and may be\r\ndescribed as a minute drop of a jelly-like substance, never at rest,\r\nbut ceaselessly changing its shape. Imagine such a particle of jelly\r\nheld suspended in a glass of water. Now it seems to extend or pour\r\nitself out on one side, into what we may call an arm, because it is\r\nreaching for an atom of food. This extended portion is drawn back,\r\nand whenever it returns into the drop, there the food is received and\r\ndigested. Therefore we say the amœba is all mouth and all stomach,\r\nbecause it can receive and digest food in any part of its substance.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the protozoa was probably a jelly-like drop composed of\r\na single cell. Sometimes a number of these cells, or individuals, clung\r\ntogether in a loosely united mass or community. When a new individual\r\nwas formed the process was by “budding,” the single cell becoming two,\r\ndividing and parting, so that each individual was complete in itself;\r\nand which was the new one, and which was the old one, or whether both\r\nwere part new and part old, certainly they themselves did not know.\r\n\r\nParallel with this group of one-celled jelly-like animals, was a group\r\nof one-celled jelly-like plants. Each of these groups stood at the\r\nbeginning of a great and constantly ascending series; the two groups\r\nwere different in their nature and in their method of nutrition, yet\r\neach so like the other, that it is very difficult to distinguish\r\nthem. Thus when we consider the dawn of life we must put the shelless\r\nprotozoa ages back before the busy shell-housed foraminifera.\r\n\r\nYet in so placing the shelless amœbæ we must not fancy them extinct.\r\nBy no means: in myriad millions they still exist, and have through\r\nall the ages, and there is no pond to-day that has not its restless\r\nkaleidoscopic representatives of life’s lowest grade.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, long journey from this formless speck of jelly to\r\nthe highest grade of life--the mammalian form; and up this long\r\nascent, conducted on a definite plan, life moved without faltering or\r\ncontradictions. Let us then in our last look at vanished fauna, regard\r\nsome of the fossil remains of that crowning class of animal life at the\r\nhead of which stands man--“Time’s noblest offspring and the last.”\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the earliest mammals is very incomplete, and is\r\nconstantly changing, as the discovery of new beds of fossils shows\r\nto us new forms, and supplies new information concerning their\r\nrelationships. The mammals were late in their arrival upon the earth.\r\nThey could afford to wait, for they had come to stay and to possess\r\nthe kingdom of nature. The first mammals lived in the first age of the\r\nReptilian time. They were nearly the size of large rats or squirrels,\r\nand curiously enough their teeth and jawbones are the portions of their\r\nbodies which have survived decay to tell their story.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of mammals differ in construction from the teeth of all other\r\nanimals, and thus if only one single tooth is found we may be sure\r\nthat it is a part of a mammalian creature; and, being a mammal, we\r\nknow certain facts in regard to it, as for instance that it was born\r\nalive,[47] and while young was cared for and suckled by its mother.\r\nWhen the teeth are molar, or grinding teeth, we know that the animal\r\nlived on grain or herbs--and thus from the formation we may decide that\r\nit was a grazing animal; sharp-pointed canine, or dog-like teeth, show\r\na meat-eating animal, a hunting, flesh-seeking creature; worn teeth,\r\nteeth with the enamel ground down, tell us that the animal was old.\r\nAmong the teeth found, some suggest mammals that lived on insects,\r\nfruit, and roots, and some teeth found in the ancient rocks are very\r\nlike those of the kangaroo rat; so that by observing the present\r\nanimals of this type, we can in general arrive at the habits of these\r\nlong extinct creatures.\r\n\r\nProbably the rat and squirrel families, capable of living on roots and\r\nnuts, and small enough to hide in crevices, in decayed trees, and under\r\nstumps, where the large reptiles could not follow to destroy them, were\r\nthe earliest mammalian forms. It is a singular fact that the rocks of\r\nthe Chalk age, the last era of the time before the last world-building\r\nperiod, have afforded no fossil mammals. This is evidently not because\r\nthere were no mammals in that age of the world; for the rocks of the\r\nsucceeding periods have yielded abundant forms of many species, showing\r\nthat mammals had extended, multiplied, and improved exceedingly. Either\r\nthe circumstances of the close of this age were not favorable to the\r\npreservation of such remains, or there are in the chalk rocks fossils\r\nwhich will yet be found.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier ages of the present or last building-time, the mammals\r\nwere not only numerous, but far exceeded in size any now existing.\r\nIndeed, it seems that as the type improved the more bulky forms passed\r\naway; the higher animals being less unwieldy. Still this suggestion\r\nmust at once be met by exceptions: for in the case of the horse, as\r\nthe model improved, the size of the animal constantly increased.\r\nThe mammals had finally become world-masters, and before them the\r\ngigantic reptiles perished. For a time mammals and reptiles of equally\r\nstupendous proportions seemed to face each other, but the new type\r\ngained the victory over the old.\r\n\r\nThe mammals, as well as the reptiles, had the faculty of adaptation;\r\nthey seemed suited to a wide variety of conditions. They fed on fish,\r\nflesh, herbs, fruits, and fowl. Some of them had bare tough skins;\r\nothers wore long scanty hair; others again were clad in fur, or heavy\r\nwool. Some of them burrowed in the ground; some lived in caves and\r\ndens; some were tree dwellers, or arboreal; others wandered over wide\r\nsavannahs or in the forests, careless of other shelter than trees or\r\nreedy jungles.\r\n\r\nNext after the rat-like families came a tribe of insect-eating\r\ncreatures like the present ant-eaters, but far exceeding them in size,\r\nsome of them being nearly as large as a rhinoceros. The mylodon was a\r\nfruit-eater and so large and strong that it was able to tear down the\r\ntrees which bore the fruit it coveted; certainly a destructive fashion\r\nof fruit-gathering, proving the mylodon much more barbarous than a\r\nSaracen.[48]\r\n\r\nMeantime, while these mammals flourished on the land there were\r\nnumerous others in the sea, and these of a very large size, although no\r\nfossils have yet shown that the sea-mammals preceded those of the land.\r\nThe whales and the sirens seem to have appeared many years ago, and\r\nhave since continued.\r\n\r\nEnormous armadillos, covered with mail and very like the tortoise\r\nfamily of reptiles, marched about the woods or sunned themselves upon\r\nthe shores. When twilight settled over the ancient woods and savannahs\r\nthe mammals of the air came forth, and bats flew zigzagging about,\r\nhunting after insects or little birds.\r\n\r\nThe bone-caves of the age before man came have abundant bones of\r\nmammals; bones which represent the pursuers and the pursued, hunters\r\nand hunted,--some the relics of the meat-eating, hunting beasts, and\r\nsome, the gnawed remains of their prey.\r\n\r\nAmong the vertebrate vegetable-eating animals we note the elephant,\r\nthe great woolly elephant now extinct, and the mighty mammoth, known\r\nonly by its remains, yet very well known, because the frozen mud of\r\nSiberia has preserved for us the entire animal, even to its eye-balls.\r\nWe have in another lesson indicated the life history of the horse-like\r\nanimals which belonged to these successive periods. There were also\r\nmany families related to the tapirs, deer, bears, and musk-oxen of the\r\npresent day. In fact the majority of the mammalian forms of the earlier\r\nages have their modified representatives in the present age; while\r\nothers, as the mastodon and many more, have made way for more modern\r\nfamilies and are known only by fossil remains.\r\n\r\nThe Ice period no doubt made a great change in the fauna of the globe.\r\nDuring its desolation and cold many families of animals perished. Other\r\ncreatures changed their homes, migrating from the formerly temperate\r\npolar regions to the tropics, retreating to warmer latitudes as the\r\nice-sheet advanced. Some of the carnivora especially were capable of\r\nresisting the cold by increasing the thickness of their coats; but\r\nanimals dependent upon a vegetable diet must either perish with the\r\nflora of the regions they inhabited, or follow the changed lines of\r\nvegetable growth, as the northerly plants perished and vegetation\r\nflourished only in the warm southerly lands.\r\n\r\nThe last of the mammals to appear in the brute creation were the\r\nquadrumana or monkey tribe, which hold the highest place in the brute\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] A later lesson will describe a mammal that comes from an egg!\r\n\r\n[48] The Mohammedan soldiers were forbidden to destroy fruit trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXI.\r\n\r\nA VERY OLD FAMILY.\r\n\r\n    “’Twas when the world was in its prime,\r\n      When the fresh stars had just begun\r\n    Their race of glory, and young Time\r\n      Told his first birth-days by the sun.”\r\n\r\n                                    --MOORE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT ARISTOCRACY.]\r\n\r\nOne June morning I was sitting by the ocean. The tide was out and was\r\nunusually low, laying bare beds of sand that were seldom uncovered.\r\nThe stone on which I sat had been dried by breeze and sun, but living\r\nbarnacles fretted its sides, and wet bladder-weed draped its edges,\r\nindicating that usually the waters flowed above it. A little farther\r\nout, a multitude of small black sea-snails lay, each with tightly\r\nclosed operculum to retain moisture sufficient until the sea returned;\r\nbut now and then some few crawled to a more favorable position; and\r\nhere and there a pale pink foot shod with a little black shoe reached\r\nforth, and taking hold upon the sand the creature pulled itself over by\r\na muscular contraction.\r\n\r\nNear me on the right the sand disappeared under a bed of dark ooze; for\r\nhere was the mouth of an inlet, and twice each day the tide hurrying\r\nback through its intricacies brought black mud from the marshes to\r\ndeposit upon the beach. In this layer of pasty soil I presently\r\ndiscovered a track very like what we call “ladder footprints” in\r\nfossils. There were numerous holes as if made by some slim, sharp\r\ninstrument, and on each side a furrow. I rose and traced this track\r\nuntil it disappeared under a fresh deposit of mud.\r\n\r\nAs I turned seaward again I saw at the edge of the water a dark-brown\r\nshining object over a foot in diameter, with rounded front and convex\r\nsurface, moving laboriously along the slime. After it had travelled\r\nsome yards from the water to a place where the mud-bank overlaid the\r\nsand by two or three feet, the creature came to a pause and presently\r\nbegan to disappear. The large, rounded shield entered plow-like into\r\nthe mud-bank, sank lower and lower, and then the triangular hinder\r\nshield vanished, and finally the long spiked tail. This animal was a\r\nlimulus, or horseshoe crab, and he was now plowing his way about in the\r\nmud, seeking for his dinner.\r\n\r\nThe previous day the tide had been very high, and I knew that in the\r\nhigh tides of June the female limulus comes up to lay her eggs on the\r\nmargin of the sand. I further reflected that numerous boulders and\r\nsmall sharp rocks were strewn along this coast, and that the high tide\r\nhad been accompanied by a violent wind. From these facts I concluded\r\nthat I might find a dead limulus among the rubbish at high-water mark.\r\nAt the summit of the beach was a long swath of sea-weed, empty and\r\nbroken shells, bits of wood, and the flotsam that is cast up by the sea.\r\n\r\nAll this débris was dry atop, but thoroughly wet a few inches below the\r\nsurface, and there “beach fleas” were hopping actively, and scallop\r\nshells lay tightly closed, and certain hapless crustaceans were on\r\ntheir backs entangled.\r\n\r\nBeing sorry for these poor creatures, likely to die long before the\r\nlagging tide returned for them, I spent some minutes in flinging back\r\ninto the water the scallops and crabs which had been cast out. As I\r\npursued these benevolent labors, I saw in the wreck heap, the long,\r\nspiked, serrated tail indicating a limulus, or horseshoe, or king crab.\r\nRemoving the rubbish I disentombed a limulus, full twenty inches across\r\nthe widest part of the shield, and that shield so hard and thick and\r\ndark, that it resembled a piece of sheet iron rather than a portion of\r\nan animal. But hard as it was, some wave flinging it upon a sharp rock\r\nhad wrought its destruction, and a large break on one side told how\r\nMadame Limulus had perished.\r\n\r\nThe animal was remarkably heavy, but dragging it to my rock, I made it\r\nthe theme of my meditation.\r\n\r\nWhat ancient family of humans in all this world, Mistress Limulus, but\r\nis modern as the last new fashion, compared with your hoary antiquity\r\nof lineage? Mongol or Hindoo, Russian or Saracen, Emperor of Austria or\r\nKing of Italy, who of them can count grandfathers with you? Compared to\r\nyou all Adam’s line are but of yesterday. If you had been a reasoning\r\nbeing, and capable of handing down traditions, all the lore of all the\r\nages might now be hidden under that vast head-shield.\r\n\r\nLimulus, or horseshoe crab, or king crab, whichever you prefer to be\r\ncalled, do you know that the last age of your race has come, and you\r\nare bearing down on extinction? The seas of China and Japan, and this\r\nancient eastern coast of North America, still cherish you and your\r\nrelatives; but the hapless fortunes of the times, the elements, and man\r\nthe pitiless, have doomed you, and soon the day will come when not a\r\nlimulus of you all will survive, except in the cases of museums. The\r\ndoom of your old-time, far-off cousins, the trilobites, is upon you.\r\nLet me trace you back to your origin; for the rocks, more faithful than\r\nyour dull and imperfect brain-cell, hold your history.\r\n\r\nVery modestly, as if hesitating whether you would be entertained in\r\nthe world’s great hostelry, one small and insignificant species of\r\nyour race arrived in the Upper Silurian age. You found the seas warm,\r\nthe sunshine tempered by vapors, the stone lilies white as that then\r\nunknown thing, snow; the coral polyps like rainbows shimmered in the\r\nwaters. You ate, swam, and were happy. You throve; you lived unobserved\r\nthrough Devonian days, and, ah, what vast mud beds, black with the\r\ndecay of moss and ferns, awaited you in the Coal period! Seven species\r\nmore came into your enlarging race, but you were humble still, and\r\nremained small and unobtrusive, lest some vast reptile should end your\r\nfamily line in his capacious maw.\r\n\r\nOne of your species, however, seized with ambition, developed beyond\r\nall the rest, and here in America grew into the size and shape you wear\r\nto-day. Fortune favored the bold, and the enterprising Yankee limulus\r\nstands at the head of your tribes until now. Back there in the Coal\r\nperiod your family were most of them weak, and wore the form not of\r\nadult king crabs, but of larvæ, with all the segments of the hinder\r\nshield free of each other; and that brave tail was but a rudimentary\r\nthorn. Perhaps this very humility, intense as that of Uriah Heep, has\r\nengineered you through the convulsions of the ages, to be the fellow\r\ncitizens, and alas! the victims of the human race.\r\n\r\nBut now the anatomy rather than the history of my limulus attracts me.\r\nOne of the ringed creatures you are, O crab, but your first ring has\r\nbecome enormously developed into the vast head shield with rounded\r\nfront and beautifully bevelled edge, sweeping back into sharp and spiny\r\ncorners, which, dragging upon the sand or mud, make the furrow on each\r\nside of your footprints. Here is this hinder shield, a rude triangle\r\nwith the apex cut out to admit the insertion of the great tail; and\r\nthis triangular shield is also made of rings, but they have grown\r\ntogether into one single piece. Still we can count them from the free,\r\nhorny points.\r\n\r\nThis sword-formed tail, my limulus, did not belong to you when, first\r\nfree of the egg-case, you sported in the water. It appeared only at\r\nyour second moult. In this you were like your progenitors of the\r\nCoal period, who wore no tails; tails being then, no doubt, the royal\r\ninsignia of the reigning line of reptiles, upon which meaner animals\r\nmight not venture.\r\n\r\nYour eyes are fitted into your head shield, and so are well protected.\r\nLet me turn you over and look at your feet. This great head shield it\r\nappears, houses not only your eyes, but all your walking and eating\r\napparatus, which seem to be closely connected. When you were in the\r\nlarval state you could double under the rings of your hinder shield,\r\nwhich then were not soldered together, so that you were neatly encased,\r\nand how safe you were!\r\n\r\nYour legs are wondrous small for your size, and, O singular creature,\r\nyou use not only your legs, but your hands and your antennæ and your\r\nmaxillars for walking. And what is this? At the base of them all you\r\nhave jaws. So away you travel on your numerous limbs, and whichever\r\nlucky member finds a morsel of food, behold a pair of jaws right at its\r\nbase to devour it! Therefore are you rightly named a “mouth-footed”\r\ncreature. There are certain mollusks with heads, which also have their\r\nheads and mouths and stomach in their feet. We hope, meeting them in\r\nthe ocean, you do not hold yourself superior to them, for they are of\r\nlineage yet more ancient than your own.\r\n\r\nYesterday, Madame Limulus, you met your death as you came up the beach\r\nheavily laden with eggs, which you intended to deposit in the sand. If\r\nI state that a million of eggs now lie under your enormous shield, I\r\ndo not think I shall over-estimate the number. You meant, as for many\r\nyears past you have done twice each year, to come near high-water mark\r\nand place your eggs in the sand, where twice daily, as the tide was\r\nlow, the heat of the sun would strike the eggs and warm them into life.\r\n\r\nWhat was your own infant experience, my limulus? Fifty days, or seventy\r\ndays, perhaps more,[49] you lay hidden in the egg, because all those\r\nchanges which other crustaceans undergo after hatching, the royal\r\nlimulus completes in the privacy of its elastic case. Change, change,\r\nstill change, within the curtains of the cradle, and at last, out comes\r\nthe living limulus, tailless, large-eyed, its hinder segments free of\r\neach other. Spiny, tiny, pale brown, glossy, a shell finer than a human\r\nbaby’s most delicate finger nail, able to swim, to find your own food,\r\nto double up and protect yourself, such you were, O limulus, on coming\r\nout of the egg.\r\n\r\nYou needed no parent to guard you, or forage for you; the sun had\r\nwarmed you into life, and the ocean was your food-bringing mother.\r\nChild of the sun and sea! Such the ancients fabled Venus, the queen of\r\nbeauty, and you, O my limulus, are one of the most uncomely of living\r\nthings. When first you found your egg-case cleft away, and came out\r\nupon the wave, six pairs of feet were ready for your walking, swimming,\r\nand food-grasping apparatus. So well endowed with members for use,\r\nand with no brain capable of large ambitions, content with to-day,\r\nand ignorant that there was ever a yesterday, or that there will be\r\na to-morrow, you, no more than a child of the house of Hapsburg,\r\nexpected beauty to be united to the splendor of--\r\n\r\nA Very Ancient Line.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[49] Dr. Lockwood kept some king-crab eggs in a dark place, three\r\nhundred and sixty days before they hatched.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE MARVEL IN MAIL.\r\n\r\n    “The woods decay, the woods decay and fall,\r\n      The vapors weep their burden to the ground,\r\n    Man comes and tills the fields and lies beneath,\r\n      And after many a summer dies the swan,\r\n    Us only cruel immortality consumes.”\r\n\r\n                                         --TENNYSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first five lessons in this Nature Reader, No. 4, were devoted to a\r\ndescription of some of the prominent facts of the periods during which\r\nour globe was built up from an immense sphere of fiery gas, to the\r\ncompact and inhabited earth which we know to-day.\r\n\r\nThe next theme of study was the solar system, under the laws governing\r\nwhich our world exists, part of which it is, and upon the members of\r\nwhich, the sun and the moon, we are so dependent that without them life\r\non our globe would be impossible. That magic power whereby the plant\r\nworld grows and ripens its fruits abides in the sunlight. It is the\r\nsun’s heat which raises water from the earth in vapor, which returns\r\nto us in showers and dew. It is that same forceful heat, poured out on\r\nvast continents, that gives rise to the winds that cool our summers and\r\nspeed the sails of our commerce. During how many ages has this lavish\r\nsunlight stored up coal for our use, that coal which flames in our\r\ngrates and stoves, glows in our gas-lights, and drives the engines of\r\nour age of steam!\r\n\r\nThat lesser light which rules the night, the silver moon, not only\r\nserves to inspire poets and artists, and to light so many otherwise\r\ndark hours, but with mysterious attraction controls the tide in ebb and\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nAfter our brief glance at the solar system, we have learned, by means\r\nof fossils hidden in the rocks, something of the wonderful progress of\r\nlife through all the earth-building ages. As we have traced this slow\r\nascent of life from its far-off, simple beginning, we have found that\r\nthe first home of life was the ocean. When the world was wrapped in\r\na mantle of seas, before the first continent thrust its rocky ridges\r\nabove the waves, no doubt those warm waves swarmed with busy life. “The\r\nwaters brought forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life”;\r\nand to-day, as in all previous ages, the sea is the headquarters and\r\nbusy home of living things. In every zone the waters teem with animal\r\norganisms, so numerous that we doubt whether the sands on the shores,\r\nor the stars that fill space equal them for multitude.\r\n\r\nAfter the survey of some of the vanished fauna that peopled the earth\r\nin past epochs, the next step suggested is to make acquaintance with\r\nyet remaining animal life, such as is more nearly related to extinct\r\nspecies than to any other surviving families. There are even now\r\nanimals more or less common, that have altered little in the slow lapse\r\nof ages, and have their nearest affinities with fossil types. Such an\r\none we have found in that most venerable of crustaceans, the limulus,\r\nor king crab!\r\n\r\nComing into creation some thousands or even some hundreds of thousands\r\nof years later than the crustaceans, the reptiles have left one of\r\ntheir early representatives, a conservative which has adapted itself\r\nto no new fashions, accommodated itself to no living species, but\r\nmaintained its integrity as a near relation of a family of fossil\r\nlizards, whose remains are found in England near Warwick, in Scotland\r\nat Elgin, in Central India, and in South Africa, indicating that in\r\ntheir palmy days they were citizens of the world, widely spread,\r\nnumerous, and nicely adjusted to the conditions of their age. This\r\nscion of a most ancient family whom we now introduce, claiming for it\r\nthe regard due to long lineage, is named the sphenodon, or hatteria.\r\n\r\nAt present the hatteria holds aloof from general society, and unless\r\nforced to exhibit in zoological gardens, confines itself to a very\r\nlimited haunt in New Zealand. In New Zealand a score or two of years\r\nago, the hatteria crawled about with the slowness proper to long years\r\nand high dignity, and enjoyed a numerous family and a comfortable\r\nindependence. Behold him, then, honorably divested of foolish pride in\r\nhis pedigree, but carefully adhering to all the manners and traditions\r\nof his venerable line.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonder is this, that a frail and short-lived creature should\r\nhave maintained itself unaltered, generation after generation,\r\nwhile, with mighty convulsions the face of nature has changed, and\r\nchanged, and changed again; the whole surface of the globe undergoing\r\ntransformations which left unaffected this one little reptile.\r\n\r\nThe hatteria belongs to the lizard-like reptiles with tails and\r\nscales; is possessed of four legs, the front pair being hand-like in\r\nstructure. The creature suggests to us some venerable grandparent who\r\nhas divided a large part of his patrimony among numerous descendants\r\nand collaterals; for the other four orders of reptiles all share some\r\nof the characteristics of the hatteria, as if it had divided its traits\r\namong them. We might write them thus:--\r\n\r\n  Snakes.     }\r\n  Crocodiles. } HATTERIA. { Fossil Saurians and Lizards.\r\n  Lizards.    }\r\n  Turtles.    }\r\n\r\nSo there is the hatteria, or sphenodon, a link between the new and the\r\nold. To explain all the points of likeness and difference would be to\r\nwrite an elaborate treatise on comparative osteology, or the science of\r\nskeletons.\r\n\r\nWhile passing over in silence the matter of the bones, we can note a\r\nfew plain points of likeness between the sphenodon and other reptiles.\r\nWhen the tail or any part of the tail is broken it is renewed as the\r\ncrustaceans renew a leg or claw;[50] this power it holds in common\r\nwith some of the lizards, which have very brittle tails. The vertebræ\r\nof the tail are made in two portions, and the line of junction in each\r\nvertebra is the weakest part; so if the tail is broken it is broken\r\non this line, and not between two vertebræ; and on this line it is\r\nrenewed. The famous philosopher, Aristotle, and that other famous\r\nancient student of nature, Pliny, seem to have been much impressed with\r\nthis ability to renew broken tails.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the hatteria is more like that of a crocodile than like\r\nthat of any other reptile; but on the other hand its legs are like\r\nthose of the lizard, so that a description of the bones of the leg and\r\nfoot of a lizard, would answer almost equally well for a sphenodon. The\r\nhatteria has nine more vertebræ in its tail than in all the rest of its\r\nbody and its head together; and to aid it in its motions while impeded\r\nby this long tail, it has some especial muscles, such as are very\r\nprominently developed in the serpent family. As the hatteria grows old\r\nits teeth wear down to a simple cutting edge, as do those of snakes.\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand native name for the hatteria is rather pretty--tuatera.\r\nStrangely enough the Maoris of New Zealand have a superstitious horror\r\nof the creature, and turn pale and shiver with abject fear if they\r\nmerely see one. Does the tuatera merit their aversion? Not at all. It\r\nis not handsome, some call it exceedingly unpleasing in appearance, but\r\nno creature is so absolutely harmless. It is without weapons of offence\r\nor defence, and without energy to use such weapons if it possessed them.\r\n\r\nThe hatteria, or tuatera, now lives in only one place in the world,\r\nand that place is a small rocky islet called Karenha, in the Bay of\r\nPlenty, in New Zealand. Formerly, the creature was abundant all along\r\nthe rocky coasts of New Zealand, living in crevices of the rock, or in\r\nlittle burrows dug by itself. The settlers in New Zealand took a fancy\r\nto the hatteria as an article of food, and the hogs which the settlers\r\nbrought with them, shared the taste of their masters, so that between\r\nmen and swine, the poor creatures have nearly become extinct. Their\r\nsole chance of maintaining existence is to confine themselves strictly\r\nto Karenha, where not a shrub, nor blade of grass, nor lichen grows,\r\nand where not a fresh-water spring is known.\r\n\r\nOn this desolate island the hatterias lie, clinging to the bare rock,\r\nabsolutely quiet, apparently unconscious, and alike indifferent to\r\nthe whipping of sharp, cold spray driven by a strong wind, and to the\r\nfierce beating of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe hatteria is from eight to twenty inches long, is of a bronze or\r\nolive-green color, spotted with yellow above, and fading into greyish\r\nwhite below. Down the back and along the tail, are sharp spines or\r\nbristles in a ridge or crest, which the creature can erect at will. Its\r\neyes are golden, and instead of the vivid quickness of the jewel-like\r\neyes of many lizards, these organs in the hatteria have the dull\r\nstare of glass eyes. Also, instead of the flash-like motions of many\r\nlizards, the hatteria is the slowest of living things. Hour after hour,\r\nday after day, it will lie like an animal fashioned of wax, desiring\r\nneither food nor drink, and seeming to need almost no air.\r\n\r\nOften people stand for a long time before the glass case of the\r\nhatterias in the London Zoological Gardens, and from the absolute\r\nquiet of the creatures, conclude that they are stuffed. But finally\r\nthey see the head turning, or the body sliding forward, with an almost\r\nimperceptible motion, slow as that of the minute hand of a clock. Or,\r\nlooking a little closer, the motion of the heart may be recognized by\r\nthe slow palpitating of the loose skin near the forearm.\r\n\r\nThe hatteria seems as contented when kept in a glass case, as when\r\nextended on its native rocks. One wonders how a creature can possess so\r\nfew of the evidences and the needs of life. It makes no noise, shows\r\nneither fear, hope, affection, nor anxiety; one might think that the\r\naccumulated age of all its long race had invaded its cold veins, and\r\nthat it was verging on petrifaction.\r\n\r\nThe hatteria in one single small specimen is the sole living\r\nrepresentative of the genus, family, and order to which it belongs. Its\r\nfossil relatives partook of characteristics now scattered among members\r\nof different classes. One of them approached the birds, in having no\r\nteeth and a beak-like projection of the jaws; others were like fish, in\r\nhaving teeth set not only in their jaws, but also, as some fish do, “in\r\nthe velvet,”[51] namely, all down the sides of the throat.\r\n\r\nThe great value of the hatteria now, is the light which it throws on\r\nobscure points in the structure of its fossil relatives. Helpless and\r\ninert, it seems to belong rather to past ages and to the dead, than to\r\nto-day and the living.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[50] Nature Reader, No. 1, Lessons 1-6.\r\n\r\n[51] Nature Reader, No. 3, Lesson 45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT BUILDER.\r\n\r\n    “Again the mossy earth looks forth, again the streams run clear;\r\n    The fox his hillside cell forsakes, the musk rat leaves his nook,\r\n    The blue-bird in the meadow brakes is singing with the brook;\r\n    ‘Bear up, O mother nature,’ cry bird, breeze, and streamlet free,\r\n      ‘Our winter voices prophesy of summer days to thee.’”\r\n\r\n                                                         --WHITTIER.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WONDERFUL BUILDER.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated animals in the world is the beaver. This\r\ncreature belongs to the mammalian order, Rodentia, or the “gnawers.”\r\nThe mammals of this order are distinguished by their strong,\r\nchisel-shaped front teeth. They have a greater number of species, and a\r\nwider distribution over the earth than any other terrestrial mammals.\r\nTo this order belong squirrels, rabbits, rats, mice, and many other\r\nspecies, and the order, as a whole, will be briefly described in a\r\nlater chapter. At present we must fix our attention upon the beaver,\r\nwhich Buffon said constituted such a link between quadrupeds and\r\nfishes, as is the bat between quadrupeds and birds. In fact neither bat\r\nnor beaver is a link between different orders, but the beaver is nearly\r\nas aquatic in its habits as a fish, and its tail is about as well\r\ncovered with scales as is the body of a fish.\r\n\r\nThe beaver is an animal of great geologic age: its fossil remains have\r\nbeen found freely distributed over northern Europe, Asia, and America.\r\nAt present it has entirely disappeared from many countries where\r\nformerly it abounded. In some places in Europe it has abandoned many of\r\nits most peculiar and interesting habits of life, and sunk slowly to\r\nnearly the condition of its distant relative, the water-rat.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the beaver, like the king-crab, is a creature evidently\r\ndoomed to extinction. The cause of the rapid disappearance of the\r\nbeaver is the value of its fur, which has caused it to be hunted with\r\na reckless disregard of the danger of destroying the entire family.\r\nThe story of the fate of the goose which laid golden eggs is not\r\nwholly a fable, but holds true of many valuable and beautiful plants\r\nand animals, which human greed has ruthlessly destroyed. The beaver\r\nno doubt had a very happy time building its huts and dams, feeding on\r\nroots and bark, and swimming merrily in the rivers, before men were\r\nknown upon the earth.\r\n\r\nThe beaver is the largest of the rodents except the capybara or\r\nwater-hog of South America. The beaver is sometimes three feet long,\r\nexclusive of the tail, and a very large beaver will occasionally weigh\r\nas much as sixty pounds. The oval, flattened tail is about ten inches\r\nlong, and is covered with scales. About this tail, as about the habits\r\nof the beaver, many foolish stories have been repeated. It has been\r\nstated that he uses it as a little cart whereon to drag loads of stone\r\nand mud for his dam; also that he uses it as a trowel to smooth in\r\nnicest mason-fashion the earth walls of his house. Neither of these\r\ntales of a tail is true.\r\n\r\nThe scaly tail of the beaver is of especial use in helping to support\r\nhis body when he stands on his hind-legs cutting down trees. One of its\r\nuses is that of sounding an alarm when disturbed in his retreats: then\r\nthe beaver rounds up his back, and brings down his tail on the water\r\nwith a blow which can be heard for a long distance.\r\n\r\nThe hind feet of the beaver are webbed up to the toe nails, like those\r\nof a duck or gull. In swimming the beaver uses only the hind feet, the\r\nfront feet, which are small and serve almost exclusively as hands, are\r\nkept hanging close by his side while he moves in the water. The head of\r\nthe beaver is short and rounded, and its upper lip is cleft, probably\r\nfor convenience in using its powerful incisors in cutting down trees\r\nand stripping off bark.\r\n\r\nThe front teeth of the beaver are very remarkable; they are long and\r\nchisel-shaped, with a sharp, cutting edge. The outer layer is made of\r\nvery hard orange-colored enamel; the inner portion is softer and wears\r\naway by the constant use of the teeth; and thus a chisel-like edge is\r\nleft. As the four front teeth wear down they are reproduced, growing\r\nup constantly from the roots. The teeth of the beaver are so sharp and\r\nhard that the Indians formerly used them, fastened into handles, for\r\ncutting their bone implements.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the beaver are small, and the ears are inconspicuous.\r\nWhen swimming or diving the beaver can draw its ears close to its\r\nhead, closing the orifice against the admission of water. The whole\r\nappearance of the animal is without beauty, as the soft, silky brownish\r\nfur is hidden by a growth of long coarse reddish-brown hairs.\r\n\r\nIn America the beavers still live in communities and build homes, but\r\nin Europe, where they cannot find secluded and undisturbed ponds and\r\nrivers, they have changed their habit and live solitary and in burrows,\r\ntheir huts and dams being now known only in one place in Europe. In\r\nAmerica there are found some few beavers living alone in burrows; these\r\nare called “idlers,” or “bachelors.” They are supposed to have left the\r\ncolony because their mates have been killed.\r\n\r\nIn their natural state beavers live chiefly on the bark of shrubs and\r\ntrees such as birch, alder, poplar, willow, while a favorite article of\r\nfood is the root and stem of the yellow water-lily. In captivity they\r\neat bread and raw vegetables, and while they greatly enjoy water for a\r\nbath or a swim, they will learn to content themselves without it. It is\r\na pity that any web-footed creature should be held in captivity, where\r\nit cannot be provided with an abundance of its natural and favorite\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nIn summer the beaver leaves his home, and setting off as if intent\r\nupon having a merry time, spends the warm season in roving about the\r\nstreams and banks, feasting on fresh herbs, and playing with his\r\nfellow-citizens of the stream. During August, with provident care he\r\ncuts down trees for the repair of his home and dam, but does not begin\r\ntheir renovation until the frosts come. This delay probably does not\r\narise from mere idleness, for the beaver is not the tramp of the brute\r\ncreation, who keeps the roads until forced by the cold to seek shelter.\r\nThe late repair has its advantages. The last coat of mud applied to the\r\nhabitation presently freezes hard as a stone, and neither wolves nor\r\nwolverines can break up the roof and disturb the repose of the owners\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nThe beaver is an inhabitant of north temperate climates, where the\r\nwinters are long and the cold sharp: he is a creature of solitudes\r\nwhere wild carnivorous animals share with him the woodlands and the\r\nbanks, and to them as to man, he is likely to fall a prey. The hunters\r\nand trappers as well as the wolves consider the beaver’s flesh a\r\ntoothsome morsel, and not only is his fur an article of commerce, but a\r\nsubstance called castoreum found in two small sacs in his body is used\r\nto some extent in medicine and perfumery.\r\n\r\nAgainst the wild beasts, the well-built wigwam and the doorways\r\nentirely under water, in a measure protect the beaver; but the trappers\r\nsecure him by traps set in his pathways or near his door. No wonder\r\nthat the beaver always abandons a locality as soon as it is settled by\r\nhis chief enemy--man.\r\n\r\nAnd now what of this dwelling which the beaver constructs for himself,\r\nprovisions, and makes his winter quarters? Wonderful tales have been\r\ntold of it, as that it is well built of logs and interlaced wattles,\r\nplastered securely, and that a proper depth of water over its entrance\r\nis secured by the construction of a dam, so large, strong, and\r\nwell-built, that a man on horseback can ride over it where it lifts\r\nabove the water. Unhappily much of this is fiction. Let us sift out the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\nThe natural home of the beaver is not a burrow like that of a\r\nwater-rat, but a wigwam above ground, built of heaped-up poles,\r\nbranches, and roots, filled in with short sticks, stones, and sods. The\r\nshape is that of a low dome-like brush heap. Inside the irregular dome\r\nwhich is some eight or nine feet in diameter, is a small room which\r\nis the living room of the beavers. Several of these huts are placed\r\nnear together and each has but one compartment; the tales of homes of\r\nmany rooms have arisen from finding the various separate homes of the\r\ncolony resting against each other. In each of these huts from four to\r\neight beavers live. In the sides of the room are the beds of leaves,\r\neach beaver having a bed of its own. The centre of the apartment where\r\nthey gnaw the bark from the short sticks which they bring in serves as\r\na dining-room. They are very cleanly, and carry out all rubbish and\r\nrefuse. The beaver house has no opening above ground. The two doors to\r\nthe wigwam are in the floor, opening into long underground galleries,\r\none connecting with the piled-up store of food branches, the other\r\nleading out toward the bank. Thus there is no approach to the home of\r\nthe beaver except by passing under the water, and it is to secure a\r\ndepth of from twenty inches to three feet of water over the entrance\r\npassages that the beaver builds a dam.\r\n\r\nIf the bank or island where the home is built is so placed that a\r\nproper current and depth of water over the passages to the food pile\r\ncan always be had, the beaver builds no dam. If the water is likely to\r\nrun low the dam is built. The dam is a loosely constructed barrier,\r\nseldom in water over three feet deep, and generally rising but little\r\nabove the surface. As the parts of trees of which it is built are of\r\nkinds which easily take root from rods or wands, as willow, birch, and\r\nalder, these sometimes shoot up and spread, growing into a kind of\r\nhedge, which, catching débris coming down stream, constantly increases\r\nthe strength and size of the structure. Slight and low as the beaver\r\ndam is, it is marvellous that a brute should construct it, and its\r\nsize is by no means contemptible. One giant dam, seven feet high and\r\na quarter of a mile long, is mentioned by H. P. Wells, an accurate\r\nobserver. Especially is it marvellous that in the places where there is\r\nlittle current the dam is carried straight across the stream, while in\r\nthose where the current is strong the structure has a deep curve down\r\nstream, and is thus capable of resisting the force of the water.\r\n\r\nIn building, the beaver trusts to the water for the conveyance of\r\nmost of its materials, but it carries roots, stones, sod, and mud,\r\nby holding these between its chin and fore-paws. It floats its wood\r\nwherever it wishes to have it by swimming behind it. Not only this,\r\nbut this wonderful builder is shrewd enough to cut down trees with its\r\nstrong, chisel-like teeth. It selects those near the stream bank, and\r\nis sufficiently skilled in woodcraft to make the tree fall toward the\r\nstream, by cutting into it most deeply on the water-ward side.\r\n\r\nThe beaver works almost entirely at night; but whether under the\r\ndirection of some one skilled beaver architect, or whether like the\r\nants and bees,[52] all work guided by a common instinct that produces\r\nharmonious labor, is not known.\r\n\r\nQuite as wonderful as the dam building is the canal making. This work\r\nthey undertake in order to facilitate the moving of food and building\r\nmaterial. Canals are described by Wells which are three feet wide, over\r\ntwo hundred feet long, and which carry from eighteen inches to two feet\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nIn the huts in winter the mother beaver suckles and rears her young\r\nones. When the family in one cabin becomes too large the young beavers\r\nmove off and build a home of their own, not too far from the original\r\ndwelling, to share the advantages of the same dam. Frequently remains\r\nof old beaver dams are found in fields now grassy or under cultivation,\r\nbut which were formerly ponds or wide curves in the beds of streams.\r\nWhile to the casual glance these may appear to be natural ridges, their\r\nregular sweep, equal strength in all parts, and their material prove\r\nthem to be the work of this ancient family of builders.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[52] See Nature Readers, 1 and 2, Lessons on Bees and Ants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIV.\r\n\r\nAN OPOSSUM HUNT.\r\n\r\n    “Within the twilight come forth tender snatches\r\n      Of birds’ song from beneath their darkened eaves;\r\n    But now a noise of poor ground dwellers matches\r\n      This dimness; neither loves, nor joys, nor grieves.\r\n    A piping slight and shrill, and coarse dull chirpings, fill\r\n      The ear, that all day’s stronger, finer music leaves.”\r\n\r\n                                                     --LOWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\n“If you want to find out anything about ’possums, go to Uncle D’rius;\r\nhe knows all about them”--this was the universal opinion in F---- and\r\none day, when my mind was greatly exercised about opossums, I repaired\r\nfor information to “Uncle D’rius.” I found that mine of didelphian\r\nwisdom seated at his front door, with his hands on his knees. “Uncle\r\nDarius,” I said, “I want you to tell me all about opossums.”\r\n\r\nThe old negro rubbed his gray head: “’Possums!” he cried, his bleared\r\neyes lighting at his favorite theme, “’possums! ’possum am ’bout de\r\nbes’ thing in des y’ere worl’, w’en h’it am roasted!”\r\n\r\n“But tell me something about them _alive_,” I urged.\r\n\r\n“’Live? ’Possum am a mighty onconsideratin’ animal when h’it ’live.\r\nAn’ w’en a man kin ketch ’possum any time he go fur him, he am a berry\r\nsma’at man, fo’ sho! Dere’s ony one sech man in dese y’ere pa’ats, an’\r\nh’it am Uncle D’rius w’en he was young an’ spry.”\r\n\r\nAnd that was all Uncle Darius could tell me about opossums. Certainly\r\nhe knew very much more. He had hunted them, and eaten them, and\r\nbrought home baby opossums to bring up for pets--but unluckily, Uncle\r\nD’rius had not habits of observation, nor any gift for telling what\r\nhe knew. Fortunately I had other means of learning something about\r\nopossums. Let us first indulge in a few plain statements about the\r\nopossum, and then devote a little time to some of its interesting\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n1. The opossum, like the beaver, is a very ancient animal; its fossils\r\nare plentifully found in the strata of the Eocene age, the first age of\r\nthe last world-building period.[53]\r\n\r\n2. The opossum is entirely an American animal; is unknown in Europe and\r\nAsia; and is found from the northern part of the Southern States to the\r\nnorth boundary of Patagonia.\r\n\r\n3. It belongs to the mammalian order of marsupials, or pouched animals,\r\nfurnished with a pouch or pocket for carrying the young.\r\n\r\n4. Its nearest relatives are found in Australia.\r\n\r\n5. With one exception it is the lowest of the mammalian orders.\r\n\r\n6. Its scientific name is Didelphys.\r\n\r\n7. This family has two groups: first, a very large group to which the\r\nopossums and their nearest kin belong; the other group has but one\r\nspecies of animal, the yapock, which thus claims a whole genus for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe yapock is a little creature with webbed feet, aquatic in its\r\nhabits: it feeds on fish and small crabs; its home is in Guatemala and\r\nBrazil; its fur is gray marked with brown.\r\n\r\nHaving disposed of the genus represented only by the yapock, let us\r\ndescribe the opossum and the general characteristics of its kindred.\r\nThe animal is small, varying from the size of a mouse to that of a\r\nlarge cat. It has several very marked characteristics.\r\n\r\nFirst, the opossum has a great number of teeth, fully fifty. These are\r\nfitted for tearing and eating flesh, for grinding up the horny bodies\r\nof insects, and also for devouring roots, berries, eggs, and fruits.\r\nWhile belonging to the carnivorous class of feeders, the opossum is\r\nthoroughly omnivorous, and seldom finds any variety of food which he\r\ndisdains to taste.\r\n\r\nThe second marked peculiarity is the pouch, formed of a large fold of\r\nthe skin of the under part of the mother opossum’s body. This fold\r\nmakes a bag, supported by two slender but strong bones, from which the\r\norder receives its name--didelphys. In this bag the mother opossum\r\nstows her little ones, and carries them about with her until they are\r\nold enough to be weaned, and can look out for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe third notable mark of the opossum is its tail, which is long and\r\nsupple, and has its terminal half bare of fur and covered with scales.\r\nThis tail is called prehensile, because hand-like it can clasp itself\r\nclosely about any object with which the creature would serve itself as\r\na support. A few turns of this lithe tail about a branch will bear the\r\nweight of even a mother opossum loaded with her pouch full of little\r\nones; and a vigorous shaking of the branch cannot dislodge her.\r\n\r\nThe fourth remarkable characteristic is to be found in the feet of the\r\nopossum. These have each five toes, and on the hind feet the large toes\r\nare without nails, and are set thumb-like in opposition to the other\r\nfour, so that these hind feet are really strong and supple hands.\r\n\r\nFinally, the opossum is distinguished by the large number of its\r\nprogeny. A cow marches about followed by a single calf; a sheep but\r\nseldom has twin lambs; the lion never has more than two whelps; but the\r\nprolific opossum goes skipping around with fifteen or sixteen little\r\nfurry children gambolling after her, or thrusting their sharp noses\r\nfrom her warm pouch.\r\n\r\nThe nose of the opossum is sharp, long, and well provided with\r\nwhiskers, as is that of a cat; the eyes are dark, sleepy looking by\r\nday, but bright and alert by night, for the opossum is a night-prowler;\r\nthe ears are erect, large, and leaf-like.\r\n\r\nThe fur is coarse and of a light gray color; occasionally a pure white\r\nopossum is found, while the smallest of all the species is dressed in\r\nbright red. This soldier-dressed opossum is no larger than a house\r\nmouse, and is a native of Mexico. In Brazil there is another small\r\nspecies which looks much like a “chipmunk,” having a reddish gray coat\r\nwith three black bands down the back.\r\n\r\nOne very interesting member of the family is called “Lord Derby’s\r\nopossum”; it is a native of South America, and is rather larger than\r\na gray squirrel; its fur is short and close, its tail is entirely\r\ncovered with scales; and usually the mother is without the pouch for\r\nthe young. To make up for this lack, she arches her long tail forward,\r\nputs all her children on her back, and they curl their limber little\r\ntails about the over-arching tail of their mother; thus, secure from\r\nfalling, they ride around in state on their soft, fur coach.\r\n\r\nAn extreme love for its numerous offspring is an eminent trait of\r\nthe opossum. The mother does not, like many human mothers, leave her\r\nchildren alone, or in the streets, or with a nurse, while she goes\r\nvisiting, shopping, or feasting. She always takes the children with\r\nher, and is never happy unless her furry brood is close beside her.\r\n\r\nThe largest and best known of all the opossum tribe is the Virginia\r\nopossum, a common variety in many parts of North America. Although it\r\nis of too nervous and irritable a disposition to be made a pet, it\r\nfrequently lives in towns. Hiding by day on the roof or in the sewers,\r\nand coming forth at night for food, it acts as a scavenger.\r\n\r\nThe little opossums are born in the spring, and the mother packs them\r\nall in her fur pocket, and carries them about with her until they are\r\nable to run, and to feed themselves. When they begin to go alone they\r\nkeep near the mother, and if alarmed rush to her and try to nestle back\r\nin their safe early quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia opossum is particularly fond of the banana-shaped fruit\r\nof the pawpaw tree, and on the moonlight nights in the autumn when\r\nthese are ripe, the opossums gather from far and near about the low,\r\nwide-spreading trees, and have a grand picnic. It is useless to try to\r\nshake the animals from the trees; for, wrapping their flexible tails\r\nabout the branches, they hold on with a persistency that defies the\r\nrudest jar.\r\n\r\nWhen caught, the opossum feigns death, and no abuse, less than putting\r\na live coal to its nose, will cause it to give sign of life. Happily\r\nthis cruel test cannot often be applied. Many an opossum, caught\r\nrobbing a poultry yard, has been left for dead by the farmer, and as\r\nsoon as his back was turned has nimbly picked itself up and glided\r\naway. So, too, many a negro has brought home from a “’possum hunt,” a\r\ncaptive, which he designed for his favorite feast; but as he kneeled\r\nby the hearth to stir up the smouldering fire, the wily opossum lying\r\nwhere it had been flung on the floor, stealthily opened one eye to\r\ninvestigate the situation, then like a flash leaped from door or\r\nwindow, and was back to the woods.\r\n\r\nOpossums live in clefts of rocks, holes in the earth, and in hollow\r\ntrees. When hunted they take refuge in the first hollow tree they can\r\nfind, and many a tree is felled by the ’possum hunters that they may\r\ncut the animal out of its retreat. The flavor of the flesh is much like\r\nthat of a young pig.\r\n\r\nIn South America the opossum seems to fill the place of an insect\r\neater, occupied in other countries by the true insectivora,--the\r\nhedge-hog, mole, and shrew. Probably in countries where they are\r\nplentiful, the opossum eats more insects than all other insect eaters\r\nput together. Its teeth are provided with numerous little points which\r\nenable them to grind, as in a mill, the horny bodies of insects.\r\n\r\nYoung birds, and young barn-yard fowls, eggs, such little animals\r\nas mice, moles, toads, and the young of rabbits and hares, tempt the\r\nappetite of the opossum, who is a general depredator. In return, either\r\nfor vengeance, or to obtain its flesh for food, the opossum is preyed\r\nupon, and were it not for its enormous yearly increase would soon be\r\nexterminated.\r\n\r\nIn Australia a little animal named a phalanger, or fingered animal, is\r\ncalled an opossum, and, indeed, closely resembles the real opossums,\r\nthough it is of a different family. Its size, pouch, and general\r\nhabits might lead it to be mistaken for one of the opossum tribe. Many\r\nof these phalangers have the skin stretched as we see it in a flying\r\nsquirrel, on each side the body between the front and hind-legs.\r\nExtending this as they spring from tree to tree, they are up-borne and\r\ncan make enormous leaps.\r\n\r\nOne of these flying-squirrel phalangers is often called “the most\r\nbeautiful of all mammals”; its shape is so graceful, its fur so rich,\r\nand its tail so long and handsome. Another phalanger is called the\r\n_acrobat_, on account of its wonderful jumping: it is smaller than a\r\nmouse, and lives daintily upon honey and certain honey-seeking insects;\r\nthus its appetite offers a strong contrast to that of the greedy\r\nopossum.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[53] The chart which serves as frontispiece should be often consulted\r\nto fix these periods in the pupil’s mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXV.\r\n\r\nA NEW FASHION OF PAPPOOSE.\r\n\r\n    “Still this great solitude is quick with life;\r\n    Myriads of insects, gaudy as the flowers\r\n    They flutter over, gentle quadrupeds,\r\n    And birds, that scarce have learned the fear of man\r\n    Are here, and sliding reptiles underground.”\r\n\r\n                                             --BRYANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opossum was chosen as the first representative of the pouched\r\nanimals, not because it is the most remarkable, but because it is the\r\nbest known, and because living specimens of it may be easily obtained\r\nif desired. In our study of the opossum we spoke of Australian animals,\r\nbecause the opossum has its kinship with the quadrupeds of that great\r\nisland continent.\r\n\r\nAustralia is the country of ancient forms of animal life, and most\r\nof its quadrupeds are marsupials. Zoologists have wondered why the\r\ntypes of animal life in Australia are so few and so ancient, and have\r\nendeavored to find the explanation of these facts in considering that\r\nduring many geological ages Australia has been divided, as it now is,\r\nfrom the Asiatic continent and that the great series of creatures\r\nwhich have arisen since that division took place, including all the\r\nhigher mammals, never reached Australia, until recently introduced by\r\nEuropeans. Thus, as the stronger and more dominant creatures did not\r\nappear to disturb or displace them, there was nothing to hinder the\r\ncontinuous development of pouched forms; and families became permanent\r\nwhich in more crowded localities have been forced out of existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A QUEER PAPPOOSE.]\r\n\r\nChief among all the Australian marsupials stands the kangaroo. This is\r\nreally a beautiful animal; wonderful in its structure, interesting in\r\nits habits; amiable, and gentle, yet courageous in disposition; readily\r\nacclimated when carried to other countries; capable of being tamed, and\r\nfinally, with flesh as useful and agreeable for food as beef or mutton.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo receives its scientific name from its feet; the family\r\ntitle, _syndactyla_,[54] means “toes together,” because the second and\r\nthird toes of its hind feet are united under the same skin up to the\r\nnails. The generic name, _macropus_, or “big foot,” is given because\r\nof the enormous length of the hind feet. In truth the fore-paws of the\r\nkangaroo are rather hands than feet. At first sight of this animal it\r\nis the remarkable disproportion between the shoulders and fore-legs\r\nand the hind-legs with their enormous haunches, which chiefly impresses\r\nthe beholder. It is as if the head and shoulders of a rabbit or hare\r\nhad been united to the hinder part of a creature as large as a pony.\r\n\r\n“This must be a very ill-shapen creature” we might conjecture from such\r\na description. But no; the remarkably large tail, the strong, active\r\nmotions, the thick fur, the bright and gentle expression of the eyes,\r\nthe erect posture of the kangaroo, unite to make it a very attractive\r\nanimal. The kangaroo does not go on all fours except when it lowers\r\nitself for grazing; it holds itself up; its fore-paws hang before it\r\nlike arms at rest and it moves by rapid leaps. When standing quietly,\r\nit supports itself upon its long, strong tail as well as upon the\r\nhind-legs.\r\n\r\nThat ancient lizard, the iguanodon, which used his two hind-legs and\r\nhis strong, pointed tail as a tripod whereon to seat himself, set\r\nthe fashion, it seems, to some of those little marsupials which were\r\ncrawling and jumping around his feet, and might have been crushed under\r\nhis mighty tread. But these frail and unpromising families of mammals\r\nhave survived the iguanodon and his race by countless generations.\r\n\r\nThe adult kangaroo weighs some two hundred pounds; but of kangaroos\r\nthere are a number of species, and these differ in size, one species\r\nbeing no larger than a hare and weighing less than four pounds. This\r\nlittle creature is called the hare kangaroo and is the most agile of\r\nthe family, making without difficulty, jumps eight or ten feet high.\r\nFossils of the kangaroo type have been found in Australia, which\r\nsuggest that the family formerly had monstrous members. Some were\r\nperhaps as large as the mastodon. When the kangaroo is spoken of in\r\ngeneral, reference is had to the distinguished and most common variety,\r\n_Macropus giganteus_, “the giant big foot.”\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo was entirely unknown to the civilized world until 1770,\r\nwhen Captain Cook put into the river Endeavor on the northeast coast\r\nof Australia. While he was delaying there to repair his ship which\r\nhad been damaged by a storm, a number of large and singular animals\r\nappeared from the woods and stood erect, gazing at the men and ship\r\nwith mild curiosity. They were too timid to permit approach, and darted\r\naway in long bounds across the grass when people went toward them. The\r\nnatives, when asked about them, replied with a strange word which the\r\nEnglishmen pronounced and spelled kangaroo, or kanguru. Such a word\r\nis now unknown in any native Australian dialect, and it is uncertain\r\nwhether it was intended as the name of the creature in question, or\r\nmerely signified “Don’t know.” However, the word has come into general\r\nuse among all nations as the common name of this animal. Finally one\r\nof Captain Cook’s party, Mr. Gore, went out gunning and shot one of\r\nthe strange creatures. Then several more were killed, and Captain Cook\r\ntook home the skins. These were examined by naturalists of different\r\ncountries, and Schreber, a German, pronounced them animals more closely\r\nallied to the American opossums than to any other creatures; for at\r\nthat time opossums were the only known pouched animals. In his work on\r\nmammals Schreber called the kangaroo the gigantic didelphys. In 1791\r\nDr. Shaw, being better informed about the kangaroo, called it the\r\ngiant macropus, or big foot, and that has since been its scientific\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroos are vegetable eaters, thus differing very greatly from\r\nthe carnivorous opossums. They feed on grass, roots, and nearly all\r\ngreen herbs. Sometimes as they browse they get down on all fours and\r\nmove slowly about in this position, which is as awkward to them as\r\ncreeping is to a full-grown man. But while browsing in this posture,\r\nthey frequently raise themselves on their hind-legs and look about to\r\nsee if enemies are approaching; for they are exceedingly timid. When\r\nalarmed they take refuge in flight, being almost as inoffensive in\r\ntheir dispositions as sheep.\r\n\r\nThe fore-feet of the kangaroo have five toes, each furnished with a\r\nlarge, strong nail; the hind-feet are exceedingly long and have but one\r\nreally well-developed toe; this one corresponding to the fourth toe of\r\na human foot. This toe is very large and strong and has a long curved\r\nnail, furnishing the kangaroo’s chief weapon. There is no great toe on\r\nthe hind-foot; the second and third toes are very slim and small and\r\nare enclosed in a common sheath up to the nails. They are used only to\r\nscratch and clean, comb-wise, the animal’s fur. Just outside the large\r\nfourth toe is a smaller one which is serviceable in walking, and also\r\nin fur-cleaning.\r\n\r\nWhile usually mild and timid the kangaroo, especially the adult male,\r\nor the mother with a little one in her pouch to fight for, will arouse\r\nherself to great courage and give battle. At such a crisis the kangaroo\r\nwill seize a dog in its fore-paws and squeeze it to death, or tear it\r\nto pieces with the large toes of the hind-feet. A kangaroo is also able\r\nto wield its tail with the strength and precision with which a man\r\nuses his arm. When chased by dogs the kangaroo will sometimes, with\r\nthis long, heavy tail, strike its pursuer a blow so severe as to stun\r\nor kill it.\r\n\r\nOccasionally adult male kangaroos will have a battle or duel. They\r\nstand face to face, bracing themselves by their tails, and simply claw\r\nat each other until they have satisfied their anger.\r\n\r\nSometimes when hunted by men or wild beasts the kangaroo is brought to\r\nbay, and defends itself in a peculiar fashion. It secures a position\r\nagainst a tree, or some object high enough to rest upon, clasping\r\nit with its fore-paws; then it braces itself firmly by its tail and\r\nlashes out with its hind-legs, armed with the immense toe and nail.\r\nIn such circumstances an angry kangaroo is a very dangerous animal to\r\napproach. The place to lean upon while showing fight in this fashion is\r\nindispensable, because the kangaroo lifts both its hind-legs at once.\r\nIt cannot make a stepping motion, lifting first one leg and then the\r\nother; nor can it rest upon one leg and kick with the other: the motion\r\nof the two legs must be similar and simultaneous.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo differs from the opossum in the number of its teeth,\r\nhaving but thirty-four instead of fifty. These teeth are formed\r\nentirely for cutting and grinding vegetable substances.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo differs from the opossum as much in the number of its\r\nfamily as in the number of its teeth. At the most two little ones\r\ncomplete the litter, and these when born are almost the tiniest of\r\nquadrupeds, are blind, helpless, and with bare skins instead of such\r\nwarm fur coats as furnish forth little kittens. These feeble babies are\r\nsnugly tucked in the fur pouch of their mother, and there, kept warm\r\nand well fed, they grow rapidly. The mother meantime rambles around,\r\nfeeding and attending to her affairs with all the indifference of an\r\nIndian squaw with her pappoose tied to her back. The squaw’s pappoose\r\nis hung over her shoulders, so that it looks out on the world from her\r\nback; the kangaroo’s far older style of pappoose is carried in a front\r\npocket, where it is always within reach of its mother’s hands and under\r\nher eyes. When the kangaroo pappoose has been for some weeks tucked\r\nsnugly away, it finally gets its eyes open, is covered with a lovely,\r\nsoft coat, and begins to feel an interest in the world at large. Then\r\nit thrusts from the pouch its head, which is a funny little copy of\r\nthe maternal head above it. Like its mother it has large, erect ears,\r\nbright eyes, and an intent expression.\r\n\r\nThe sight, smell, and hearing of the kangaroo are extremely well\r\ndeveloped, and, owing to its timidity, the creature is always on\r\nthe alert to discover if enemies are near. It stands a picture of\r\nattention, its eyes gazing steadfastly, its ears erect and set toward\r\nthe wind to catch the first note of danger, the flexible nostril\r\nquivering as it scents now here, now there, for warning of a foe.\r\n\r\nThis timidity also causes the kangaroo to avoid solitude; they neither\r\ngo singly, nor in pairs; but in little groups, each group or herd under\r\nthe charge of some strong and wise old male kangaroo. These bands are\r\noften made up of an old father and mother kangaroo and their children.\r\nOne, and sometimes two, little ones are born at one time, but as they\r\nattain their growth they linger about their parents. Thus the adult\r\npair will be followed by a train of eight, ten, or twelve children of\r\nall ages and sizes, from full-grown specimens, seven or eight years\r\nold, down to the keen-eyed little creature peering out of its good\r\nmamma’s fur pocket. It was formerly the custom of that nearly extinct\r\nanimal, the bison, to go in herds, led by the oldest and strongest\r\nfighters.\r\n\r\nKangaroos prefer to graze in the vicinity of woods; for they are good\r\nclimbers, and given to taking refuge in trees. When the jump, for\r\nwhich the kangaroo is famous, is made, it is by muscular contraction\r\nof the great hind-legs, and with this effort they droop the head and\r\nshoulders, and balance them by the long tail, which during the jump is\r\nheld horizontally backward.\r\n\r\nWhen full grown the coat of the kangaroo is silky on the head,\r\nshoulders, and tail, and woolly on the body. The skin, especially of\r\nthe legs and haunches, is thick and tough, and makes good leather. The\r\navidity with which these animals are hunted in Australia will soon make\r\nthem as scarce as bison have become from the same reckless slaughter;\r\nand unless means for their preservation are taken, the nineteenth\r\ncentury is likely to see the extinction of this remarkable, ancient\r\nmacropus family.\r\n\r\nThe kangaroo is so easily acclimated that some effort is being made in\r\nEurope to breed kangaroos. As they are readily kept it is thought that,\r\ndomesticated and carefully reared, they would be as useful for hides\r\nand flesh, as cattle or sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[54] Pronounced sin-_dak_-tilla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVI.\r\n\r\nLOW DOWN IN THE SCALE.\r\n\r\n          “Parts relate to whole;\r\n    One all extending, all preserving soul\r\n    Connects each being, greatest with the least;\r\n    Made beast in aid of man, and man of beast;\r\n    All served, all serving, nothing stands alone;\r\n    The chain holds on, and where it ends--unknown.”\r\n\r\n                                            --POPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCareful and pains-taking observation has lain at the beginning of\r\nmost great discoveries; the busy miner, not the careless idler, finds\r\nthe gold. A course of accurate study in some particular department\r\nof science has often opened up new views, and afforded new data in\r\nsome very different and equally important subject. Thus diligent\r\ninvestigations in the flora and fauna of various countries have not\r\nonly revealed facts connected with plants and animals, but have\r\nunfolded new chapters in the history of earth-building.\r\n\r\nA very minute study of the plant and animal life of Australia, New\r\nZealand, South America, and some of the South Pacific islands has made\r\nclear the fact that certain types are common to all those localities,\r\nand are not found elsewhere. Does some one say, “What is curious about\r\nthat? That is nothing!” To the ardent disciple of science, whose mind\r\nis keenly at work on the problems of nature, this fact means much. The\r\nfirst deduction from such a fact is that these lands must once have\r\nbeen very nearly united, while widely separated from the rest of the\r\nworld, and that over them plants and animals have spread from a common\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\nFollowing the hint thus given, it has been concluded after more\r\nextended observation, that at some former time there was around the\r\nSouth Pole a great Antarctic continent, or a vast archipelago with its\r\nislands closely strewn upon the South Polar sea, which then was not a\r\ndesolate waste of ice-floes, diversified by glittering icebergs, but\r\nwas mild and beautiful as the Pacific.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that once the North Polar lands enjoyed a temperate\r\nclimate and abundant vegetation. No doubt the South Polar regions were\r\nblessed with a similar golden age. Since this Antarctic continent\r\nstretched out to join, or nearly join, Australia, New Zealand, South\r\nAmerica, and certain of the South Pacific islands, its fruits, flowers,\r\nbirds, beasts, and fresh-water fishes were distributed among all these\r\ncountries. When climatic changes came to the Antarctic land; when,\r\nperhaps, much of its shores were submerged; when deep and icy waters\r\nflowed where reefs and shallows had been; when whole islands sank\r\nbeneath the waves never to rise again,--then Australia and New Zealand\r\nwere for long ages parted from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe attention of explorers has been directed to the Arctic, rather\r\nthan to the Antarctic regions; thrilling adventures at the north have\r\nprovoked ardent minds to seek adventures yet more thrilling. The search\r\nfor sperm whales and for a Northwest Passage has diverted interest from\r\nthe Antarctic land, where marvels as great and rewards as rich, no\r\ndoubt, await the explorer. Now that interest in these unknown regions\r\nhas been roused it may not be long before we learn the secrets hidden\r\nfor ages in ice-caskets in the south.\r\n\r\nThe tide of modern civilized life set but slowly toward those great\r\ncontinent-like islands which lie far to the south of Asia. Thus it\r\nhappened that the plants, animals, birds, and insects that follow\r\nthe progress of civilized man across the world were long unknown in\r\nthese localities, while their own plants repeated themselves seed-time\r\nafter seed-time, and the helpless, clumsy, old-fashioned fauna kept\r\ntheir race intact, living undisturbed in the methods of their earliest\r\nancestors. The hunter’s dog and gun were unknown: the teeth of hogs\r\nturned loose to revert to the manners of wild boars, and the claws of\r\ncats relapsing from domestication to the state of savage feline tribes,\r\ndid not molest the defenceless ancient families of Australian beasts.\r\nSo it has happened that this country and New Zealand have preserved\r\nsome marvellous types of life.\r\n\r\nWhen travellers first described the curious creatures that they\r\nhad found living in the Antipodes, their accounts were met by that\r\ndisbelief which has often waited upon the first proclamation of truths.\r\n\r\nThe facts that the world is round; that, with regard to the earth, the\r\nsun is stationary while the earth moves; that far to the north the sun\r\ncontinues for weeks above the horizon in a long day without a night;\r\nthat one can pass the Straits of Gibraltar--then called the pillars\r\nof Hercules--and sailing south can circumnavigate the extremity of\r\nAfrica,--were long ago received as idle tales unfit for belief. In\r\nfact, some of these statements were thought to be so false that the\r\nvery announcement of them was criminal.\r\n\r\nThe poet tells us that the discoverer of the North Cape, the Norseman\r\nOthere, went to the court of King Alfred to relate to him the wonders\r\nof the far north and the mighty walrus hunt held there. King Alfred\r\ncould not believe the tale.\r\n\r\n    “‘Four days I sailed to eastward,\r\n      Four days without a night:\r\n    Round in a fiery ring\r\n    Went the great sun, O King,\r\n      With red and lurid light.’\r\n\r\n    “Here Alfred, King of the Saxons\r\n      Ceased writing for a while;\r\n    And raised his eyes from his book,\r\n    With a strange and puzzled look,\r\n      And an incredulous smile.\r\n\r\n    “‘There were six of us all together,\r\n      Norsemen of Helgoland;\r\n    In two days and no more\r\n    Walrus we killed three score,\r\n      And dragged them to the strand.’\r\n\r\n    “Here Alfred the Truth-Teller\r\n      Suddenly closed his book,\r\n    And lifted his blue eyes,\r\n    With doubt and strange surmise\r\n      Depicted in their look.”[55]\r\n\r\nSuch doubts from honest souls have attended the declaration of new\r\ntruths, and strangely enough, extraordinary fictions have usually been\r\nmore willingly received than extraordinary facts.\r\n\r\nWhen the early travellers in Australia declared that they had there\r\nfound animals like none other in creation, mammalian creatures that\r\nlaid eggs and suckled their young; four legged, fur or quill-wearing\r\nanimals, that were toothless, had duck’s bills, were aquatic in their\r\nhabits, built nests, and had webbed feet, the description was received\r\nwith a howl of derision. When skins of the marvellous creatures were\r\nsent home for inspection doubt still remained, and it was said that by\r\nsome skillful manipulation the “head of a new kind of duck had been\r\nfastened to the body of a new kind of beaver to deceive science with a\r\nnew kind of animal!”\r\n\r\nWider zoological knowledge might have suggested that these creatures\r\nwhich were esteemed mere myths not only existed but were exactly what\r\nwas to be expected. For as “Nature makes no leaps,” it was in entire\r\nharmony with the plan and progress of creation, that the order which\r\nwas lowest in the scale of its class should share the characteristics\r\nof the next lower and less highly organized classes.\r\n\r\nThe new world had already surprised the old with the marsupial\r\nopossums, and later Australia had contributed many other families of\r\npouched animals. These had been placed in the lowest order of mammalian\r\nlife. But here was a new type evidently lying still lower in the scale;\r\nand whereas some others of the newly discovered creatures bore some\r\nof the traits of ancient reptiles, these seemed to ally themselves to\r\nbirds. It was hard to be believed.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the disputed animals had been caught, tamed, and sent to\r\nEngland and Germany for examination, great was the amazement of the\r\nscientific world. Articles were written, pictures were made, and for\r\na time the new beasts were the theme of general discussion. The first\r\nname given to the first specimen was the platypus, and duck-billed\r\nplatypus was the common designation for a time from 1799. The colonists\r\nin Australia meanwhile named the duck-billed and beaver-like animal a\r\n“water-mole,” from the fashion of its feet. The name platypus, however,\r\nwas dropped because it had already been conferred on another creature.\r\nThen more learned heads were put together, and a name was produced so\r\nlong and hard in Latin, that I dare not quote it. It meant, however,\r\n“bird-beaked-paradox.”[56] Probably the reason the poor thing has\r\nsurvived such a name is that it knows nothing about it.\r\n\r\nThe finding of these curious animals made it necessary to erect another\r\norder in the mammalian class, an order that should embrace creatures\r\nlower in the scale than the marsupials. Four species under this order\r\nhave been found, and probably there are no others. The duck-bill and\r\nthe echidna, or “thorny” creature, are the two most interesting, and\r\nwith most marked characteristics; to them we will now devote our\r\nattention. We shall see that no name more apt than that of “paradox,”\r\ncould be given to creatures with such apparently contradictory\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[55] Longfellow, “The Discoverer of The North Cape.”\r\n\r\n[56] “_Ornithorhynchus paradoxus._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MALLANGONG.\r\n\r\n    “I’m truly sorry man’s dominion\r\n    Has broken nature’s social union,\r\n    And justifies that ill opinion\r\n      Which makes thee startle.”\r\n\r\n                            --BURNS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnglish settlers had not been long in Australia before they were told\r\nby the natives of a very curious animal, the description of which\r\nseemed rather that of an imaginary than of a possible creature. The\r\nanimal was called by the Australian natives a mallangong, and was said\r\nto be very shy and secretive in its habits. The traders who heard these\r\nstories concluded that they dealt with some fabulous beasts, such as\r\nappear in the folk-lore of nearly all countries.\r\n\r\nBut one day a trader who was interested in natural science was standing\r\non the bank of a pond, when suddenly a new animal rose to the surface\r\nof the water and swam noiselessly about. The creature had the soft\r\nthick fur of a beaver or otter, now apparently black, as it was wet\r\nand clung closely to the skin. Four legs the trader counted, and as\r\nthe feet came to the surface they showed that they were webbed and\r\npink-palmed like a mole’s feet. Stranger still, the small, pointed head\r\nappeared to have neither eyes nor ears, yet bore above the water a\r\nlarge, flat duck’s bill.\r\n\r\nAs the excited trader looked, the beast sank noiselessly out of sight.\r\nHe realized that he was the first white man who had seen a mallangong,\r\nand that the strange tales were true tales. The Australian wonder\r\nmust be taken from the domain of folk-lore and handed over to the\r\ninvestigations of science. But you must first catch your mallangong.\r\n\r\nHe consulted the people who came to his trading-house, and they told\r\nhim that he must find a regular hunter of the mallangong; for the beast\r\nwas wary and scarce. At last an old native was brought to him, who said\r\nthat he knew how to get the desired prey; and at once a hunting party\r\nwas organized and armed under the old man’s direction. What weapons\r\ndid they take? Guns and knives? Not at all. The old hunter had for\r\nhis equipment a long, tough, slender stick, pointed at one end. This\r\nwas for prodding, not the mallangong, but the ground. Two or three\r\nothers of the party were given drills and shovels, or pick-axes, and\r\nso prepared they set out, the old man leading the way to the bank of a\r\nlittle stream.\r\n\r\nAs he slowly moved along he thrust his rod into the ground and twisted\r\nit about. The others of the party considered this very dull hunting.\r\n\r\n“I have found him!” cried the old man. “Dig! dig! Behold the\r\nmallangong!”\r\n\r\nThe shovels soon laid bare a little tunnel, which the guide said was\r\nmade by the animal and led to its nest. With some eagerness the men\r\nfollowed up this tunnel, digging carefully. The process was long. The\r\ntunnel wound about and seemed to have no end. At last, with a cry of\r\ntriumph, the guide laid open a small circular chamber, and picked up a\r\nball of fur. “Lo, the mallangong!”\r\n\r\nThe animal was rolled up, its long, flat bill being turned about so\r\nthat it rested on the fur-clad back. The feet were drawn up under the\r\nbody so as to be invisible, and the captive seemed either dead or very\r\nsound asleep.\r\n\r\nThe trader carried his prize home, and soon it became lively and\r\nfriendly. Almost all creatures like sugar and milk; very few disdain\r\nbread. The prisoner accepted kindly the novel food offered to it;\r\nenjoyed the sunlight; lost all fear of humanity when it was not treated\r\nwith inhumanity; recognized the voice of its master; came at his call;\r\nand when he seated himself in a chair promptly climbed to his shoulder\r\nand surveyed its new surroundings with great interest.\r\n\r\nNow that it was out of the water it was found to have nostrils in the\r\nextremity of its bill, small, bead-like eyes shining from the mass of\r\nfur, and ears acute enough, though they were merely holes hidden in the\r\ndepths of the fur. The hind-feet, while webbed like those of a duck,\r\nwere palmed like those of a mole, and spurred like those of a rooster.\r\n\r\nWhile it enjoyed the warmth of the sunshine, in which it would lie\r\ncurled up in a ball, as we sometimes see a cat or a dog, it preferred\r\ndarkness for its explorations. At night it crawled about the room,\r\nworked its way up the wall by bracing against the furniture, and\r\nrummaged everywhere with its busy feet and broad bill. Perhaps it was\r\nsearching for its friends, its native stream, and some soft earth\r\nwherein to burrow.\r\n\r\nA pile of shavings or raw cotton and straw afforded the nearest\r\napproach to an earth bank that it could find in the warehouse, and in\r\nsuch a heap it would dig until it reached the wall, and then it would\r\ncurl itself up and take some comfort in being securely hidden. A rat\r\nor squirrel in such a case would have gnawed through the wooden wall\r\nand departed without taking formal leave; but the mallangong could\r\nnot break prison in this fashion, because it has no true teeth, only\r\nseveral horny protuberances on each jaw.\r\n\r\nExamined at leisure, the marvellous animal was found to have cheek\r\npouches something like those of a squirrel, and evidently very\r\nconvenient as baskets for carrying food through the long tunnel\r\nwhich led to its room. The temper of the creature seemed gentle; it\r\nmade no noise either for joy or pain, but a low whining sound, or,\r\nif irritated, a soft growl. At first its owner thought it entirely\r\ndefenceless, but the old native showed him the spurs, and gave\r\ninstances where when angered the animal kicked out with its hind feet\r\nand inflicted a long deep scratch, which was followed by symptoms of\r\npoisoning. On examination it was found that the spur was traversed\r\nthrough all its length by a tiny canal, which led to a gland or sac at\r\nthe upper part of the leg; the whole arrangement being very like the\r\npoison gland and fang of a snake. This spur is present in a rudimentary\r\nstate in all young mallangongs; in the grown females it disappears,\r\nand in the males it very greatly enlarges, no doubt because they are\r\nexpected to do the fighting for the entire family.\r\n\r\nThis animal, popularly called by foreigners a “duck-bill,” and by\r\nscientific people a “bird-nosed-paradox,” is about twenty inches in\r\nentire length; it has its bill covered with tough skin, and finished\r\nwhere it joins the head with a fold or ruffle of skin; the fur is soft,\r\nfine, thick, deep-brown above, and paler on the under part of the\r\nbody. The web in the hind-feet falls short of the strong toe nails, but\r\non the front feet it extends beyond the toes, so that when the feet\r\nstrike upon the water a broad surface is produced, enabling it to swim\r\nand dive swiftly and silently. The duck-bill is entirely aquatic in its\r\nhabits and never lives far from water, making its tunnel with the round\r\nchamber, in the bank of a pond or stream, so that it can come from its\r\nfront door and betake itself instantly to its favorite element. Its\r\nmanner of digging is like that of a mole. While digging it contracts or\r\nfolds back the superfluous skin or web of its fore-feet. The burrow has\r\ntwo doors, one just above, the other below the water-line. The tunnel\r\nis from twenty to fifty feet long, and the room at the end is lined\r\nwith dried grass and leaves, affording a soft bed for the young, which\r\nare there reared until they are able to swim and forage for themselves\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nThe food of the duck-bill, or mallangong, is generally found in the\r\nbottom of the stream or pond; the animal dives, turns over the stones\r\nwith its spade-like bill, and finds in the ooze worms, small crabs,\r\nthe larvæ of beetles, and water insects. Filling its cheek pouches\r\nwith this prey it ascends to the surface and swims quietly about,\r\nwhile it carefully grinds its food into pulp with the bony, tooth-like\r\nprojections of the jaws. In this careful mastication the lowest of the\r\nmammals sets some of the highest of the mammals a fine example.\r\n\r\nThe tail of the duck-bill is short, thick, and pointed; it is of very\r\nlittle use in swimming, and for that matter the hind-feet are also\r\nlittle used in the water, the broadly webbed fore-feet being the chief\r\npaddles.\r\n\r\nFor almost three quarters of a century the question of the young of\r\nthe duck-bill paradox was undecided. Report was that the creature laid\r\neggs; but then it was a mammal and fed its little ones with milk: how\r\ncould any mammal lay eggs? In 1884 the matter was finally settled by\r\nindisputable proofs. The duck-bill mother lays two eggs, less than an\r\ninch long and cased in strong but flexible shells. When the little ones\r\nemerge from the shell they are exceedingly small, and are fed with\r\nmilk from milk-glands in the skin of the mother, to which they attach\r\nthemselves. They grow rapidly, and when they are weaned are given\r\ninsect-food. Shortly after this they are led out of the tunnel, and at\r\nonce swim with ease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVIII.\r\n\r\nBESIDE AUSTRALIAN RIVERS.\r\n\r\n    “He can behold\r\n    Things manifold\r\n    That have not yet been wholly told--\r\n    Have not been wholly sung or said.”\r\n\r\n                         --LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe famous mallangong has a cousin almost as marvellous as itself.\r\nIts common name is the porcupine ant-eater; its scientific name is\r\nEchidna. When first the habits and anatomy of the duck-bill had been\r\ninvestigated the question arose: Was this a lonely species, having\r\nresemblances to many animals and close relationships with none; sole\r\nrepresentative of its order; as isolated as the hatteria? A search\r\namong the animals of Australia brought to light another relative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “LOW DOWN IN THE SCALE.”]\r\n\r\nThe new animal inhabited the rocky districts and was plentiful in New\r\nSouth Wales. There, among the mountains, it burrowed in loose sand\r\nbrought down by the water-courses, or hid in crevices of the rock. It\r\nwore the quill overcoat of the sea-urchin, and when coiled to sleep\r\nlooked not unlike a large specimen of that remarkable star-fish.[57]\r\nIn size the echidna is about like the European hedge-hog (not our\r\nporcupine); it wears spurs like a rooster; it has the toothless\r\njaws and the long flexible tongue of the ant-eater. It is entirely\r\ninsectivorous in its diet, and from that and its quills, like a\r\nporcupine, it has its common name, “the porcupine ant-eater.”\r\n\r\nThe head of the echidna is small and pointed, its eyes are nearly\r\nhidden under its quills; so are its ears, which are merely holes\r\nwithout external appendages. The frontal bone of the skull is prolonged\r\ninto a slim snout not unlike a slender bill. Near the end of this snout\r\nare the nostrils. This snout is mostly covered with thin skin. The\r\nmouth orifice is small, but large enough for all the creature’s needs;\r\nits manner of eating is to thrust out a long, flexible, delicate tongue\r\ncovered with a glue-like substance. To this insects adhere, and the\r\ntongue being drawn in, the insects are swallowed. The echidna has no\r\nteeth; as its food is ants and small flies it needs none. The tongue\r\nand palate are covered with fine spines which no doubt crush the insect\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nOn account of its diet this creature was formerly called the ant-eater,\r\nbut that name has been dropped, as it belongs to a very different\r\ncreature, the true ant-eater of the order Edentata.\r\n\r\nThe legs of the echidna are short and strong. The feet are not webbed,\r\nbut are furnished with very powerful claws, and are admirably fitted\r\nfor digging. The hind-feet have such a spur as was described in the\r\nchapter on the duck-bill.\r\n\r\nThe body of the echidna is covered with a close short fur; among this\r\nfur grow long spines thickly set, which project above the fur and\r\nentirely hide it. These spines are directed from the head backwards,\r\nbut along the upper part of the body a large number of spines are also\r\nturned inward; thus they cross each other, and form a thorny, nearly\r\nimpenetrable covering. The tail is very short, and is entirely hidden\r\nby projecting spines. When the echidna rolls itself up the spines stand\r\nout like a bristling thorn hedge all over the ball which it forms, and\r\nthis sharp armor is ample defence. The mouth of a dog, or the hand of\r\na man endeavoring to seize the curled up echidna would be speedily\r\nwithdrawn, pricked and bleeding.\r\n\r\nThe echidna seems quite aware of the defensive quality of its coat,\r\nfor when alarmed it tranquilly curls up and defies attack. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, it prefers to take refuge in burrowing, and it will disappear\r\nas quickly as a mole or a razor-shell clam.\r\n\r\nThe echidna is less easily tamed than the mallangong; it is restive,\r\nand constantly tries to burrow out a path of escape. On the other\r\nhand it seems of a hardier constitution; it has been carried across\r\nthe sea, and has lived for some years in foreign zoological gardens.\r\nThe mallangong has never survived an ocean voyage, and has been seen\r\nin captivity only in its native country. When travelling at sea\r\nthe echidna is deprived of its natural insect-diet, but lives very\r\ncomfortably on sweet liquids.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the echidna are nocturnal. It generally sleeps most of\r\nthe day, and comes out at dark to prowl for insects. We might at first\r\nconsider this strange conduct, as the insects on which it feeds fly or\r\ncrawl about during the day and hide by night. But this is just what\r\nour prickly hunter wishes. He is not content to pick up a toiling ant\r\nhere, and another there. When the ants are snugly housed after sundown\r\nthe echidna searches out their hills, tears open a hole in one side,\r\nthrusts in his long nose, and then running out his slim, limber tongue\r\nhe twists it here and there, and the ants and their white larvæ[58]\r\nbundles are collected by scores on its viscid surface.\r\n\r\nHaving gone from one ant-hill to another until its hunger is satisfied,\r\nor the morning dawns, or it grows weary, the echidna retires to its\r\nburrow or rock crevice. On the road it takes a drink of water, and\r\nmakes a dessert of a liberal quantity of sand and mud. As fowls need\r\nsome sharp bits of stone or shell in their gizzards to help grind up\r\ntheir food, the echidna seems to need in its stomach gritty material\r\nto grind the oily, insect bodies and keep them from packing. This need\r\nof some coarse substance with food is not confined to fowls and the\r\nechidna. Any sheep farmer will tell you that his sheep must be given\r\nwhat he calls “roughness” with their food. The “roughness” is ground or\r\nfinely cut straw. If this is not given with corn and wheat, the sheep,\r\nhowever well fed, will become thin and weak, because their food is too\r\nrich to be well assimilated.[59] When sheep are grazed and not fed,\r\nthey gather their “roughness” for themselves, in dry leaves, roots,\r\nstems, and little twigs.\r\n\r\nIn disposition the echidna is sluggish; seems to have no playfulness;\r\ndoes not object to having its nose gently stroked, but makes no\r\nfriends, and except for its wonderful construction is not an\r\ninteresting creature.\r\n\r\nIn Tasmania there is the short-spined echidna, which has much shorter\r\nand weaker spines and much thicker fur than the one just described. In\r\n1877 a new species living on a mountain thirty-five hundred feet high\r\nwas discovered in New Guinea. It also had fewer spines and thicker,\r\nrougher fur. This mountaineer of the echidna family is much larger than\r\nhis relatives of lower regions.\r\n\r\nNo fossil remains of any great age have been found to prove that these\r\nanimals are of distant antiquity. We cannot tell in what age they\r\nentered into existence. No remains of types connecting them with lower\r\nvertebrates on the one hand, or higher mammals on the other, have been\r\ndiscovered. The only fossil portion of an echidna that has been thus\r\nfar secured is a shoulder-bone, found in a bed of bones belonging to\r\nextinct species of marsupial, or pouched animals. This shoulder-bone\r\nindicated an animal larger than any living echidna.\r\n\r\nOne echidna, called the tachyglossus of Van Dieman’s land, eats grass\r\nand tender leaves as well as insects. It lives less among rocks, as it\r\nis very fond of burrowing. This specimen of the echidna is a marvellous\r\ndigger. If disturbed it begins to make a great tearing of earth with\r\nits five-toed feet, and sinks out of sight almost as if it went down in\r\nwater. Perhaps you have seen a crab perform this feat, keeping its eyes\r\nfixed on you until, presto! it has vanished as if by enchantment.[60]\r\n\r\nThe echidna, like its relatives, is a milk-giving, egg-laying animal.\r\nOnly one egg is laid at a time, and that is very small. The egg is\r\ntucked into a fold of the mother’s skin, not a pouch such as the\r\nmarsupials have, but a long fold. Here it is kept warm until it\r\nhatches. Until it has attained over one-third of its growth the mother\r\nnourishes the young creature with milk.\r\n\r\nThe Echidnidæ have all very quick tongues, which dart in and out of\r\ntheir tube-like mouths rapid as the play of a snake’s forked tongue.\r\nTheir mouths are very soft and delicate, and in burrowing the nose\r\nis carefully shielded, while the claw-armed fore-feet do most of the\r\nwork. Owing to the quick movements of the tongue some naturalists have\r\nabandoned the name echidna, which refers to the thorny coat, and give\r\nthe name tachy-glossus, “quick-tongued,” to the entire family.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] See Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 40.\r\n\r\n[58] Nature Reader, No. 2, Lesson 2.\r\n\r\n[59] Cows fed entirely on grain and roots will gnaw at fence-posts and\r\npalings in an effort to get the woody, coarse substance supplied by\r\ncoarse grass stems in their ordinary hay food.\r\n\r\n[60] Nature Reader, No. 1, Lessons 1-5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIX.\r\n\r\nA WALK AMONG WONDER TREES.\r\n\r\n    “The groves of Eden, vanished now so long,\r\n    Live in description and look green in song.\r\n    These, were my breast inspired with equal flame,\r\n    Like them in beauty, should be like in fame.”\r\n\r\n                                            --POPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe know that vegetable life has accompanied and probably preceded\r\nall animal life. The long successions of animal existences have been\r\nattended in their march through time by an equally long succession of\r\nplants. All those ancient and wonderful living creatures which we have\r\nnoted have been and are now matched by equally wonderful vegetable\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEFORE BLOSSOMS.]\r\n\r\nA few of the wonderful plants of the world we now propose to set as in\r\na garden, and walk forth among them in fancy, and note their marvels.\r\nCome then, let us take a walk among wonder trees.\r\n\r\nWho is there that enjoys the strange, the unique, the rare, the grand\r\nin nature? Let him come and walk slowly through this wonder grove with\r\nus, and his passion for the strange and the unexpected may be satisfied.\r\n\r\nOur first wonder tree is notable only for its great age and vast\r\nsize. It is the Cowthorpe oak of Yorkshire, England. John Evelyn, the\r\npleasing writer and true gentleman of Charles Second’s time, celebrates\r\nthis oak in his book called “Sylva.”\r\n\r\nThis noble tree is fully fifteen hundred years old. Not the oldest\r\ntree in the world then, for some of the olives in Gethsemane, near\r\nJerusalem, are supposed to be older than that by several hundred\r\nyears. The girth of the Cowthorpe oak at the ground is seventy-eight\r\nfeet. Forty persons can stand inside its hollow hole. One of its main\r\nbranches broke off in a gale, and being cut up, yielded five tons of\r\ntimber. In Evelyn’s time the branches shaded half an acre of ground.\r\nThe circumference of this tree is greater than that of the Eddystone\r\nlight-house. That famous light-house was modelled after an oak tree, as\r\ngiving the best pattern of a well-rooted, firmly resisting column.\r\n\r\nThis Cowthorpe oak is not the largest tree in the world. There is a\r\ntree in South America with a girth of one hundred and twelve feet,\r\nand a California red-wood is known that measures one hundred feet\r\naround just above the ground. The red-woods belong to an ancient order\r\nof vegetation, and doubtless it could be said of the trees of the\r\nCarboniferous, and next two or three world-building periods, “There\r\nwere giants in the earth in those days.”\r\n\r\nAustralia is a land of wonders, animal and vegetable, and one of its\r\ncuriosities stands next in our grove--the bottle tree. The name is\r\ngiven because of the shape of the tree, which resembles a gigantic\r\nbottle. This tree is sixty feet high; the bark is brown, smooth,\r\nshining, like thick glass. The girth of the tree is greatest just\r\nabove the root, where it is forty feet in circumference; it tapers\r\nvery little until about forty feet above the ground, where it narrows\r\nsuddenly into a shape like the neck of a bottle; and in this neck the\r\nbranches have their base. The branches are rather the long, pliant\r\nstems of compound leaves than real branches; and the slender, numerous,\r\nsmall leaves give a light, feathery effect to the foliage. This leafy\r\ncrown forms the fantastic cork, or stopper, of this quaint bottle. The\r\nleaf-stalks rise and then bend over in a dome, or umbrella shape. The\r\nbottle trees grow in groves of about thirty each, and stand a hundred\r\nfeet apart, as regularly as if planted by the hand of a gardener.\r\n\r\nBe careful and do not tread on our next tree, the very pigmy of\r\ntrees; perfect in root, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, fruit,--a\r\ndwarf cherry tree from Japan. Are the trees of Japan then even more\r\ndiminutive than the little, olive-skinned, and almond-eyed people? How\r\ndid the skilful Japanese gardeners succeed in making this tiny tree?\r\nFor it is dwarfed not by nature, but by the art of man.\r\n\r\nI once saw one of these dwarfed cherry trees. It was a foot high and\r\nhad a trunk about as thick as a lead pencil. The leaves were as small\r\nas those of the clipped box plants which bordered the flower-beds in\r\nmy grandmother’s garden. There were perhaps twenty or thirty small,\r\nred cherries upon it; but the cherries were large in proportion to\r\nthe tree. This is a curiosity merely, and artificial; we admit it for\r\nthe sake of contrast, and pass it by for a mighty tree that stands\r\nnext,--bo, the “god tree” from Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe bo tree is famous for its long life and the reverence paid to it\r\nby its Ceylonese worshippers. Perhaps it was the vigor and stately\r\nbeauty of the bo tree which suggested to the Ceylonese that it was\r\neither divine, or the especial dwelling-place of a divinity. Alone\r\nthe bo tree stood, and for two thousand years had been the idol of\r\ntree-worshippers. In 1887 a tremendous storm swept the island of Ceylon\r\nand prostrated the ancient idol tree. The fragments were gathered by\r\nthe people and cremated with all the pomp awarded to dead kings.\r\n\r\nThe next specimen in our wonder grove comes from Africa, the famous and\r\nbeneficent rain tree. This is a tall and beautiful tree, with widely\r\nspreading branches, gifted with the astonishing power of extracting\r\nwater out of apparently the driest soil and atmosphere. While the earth\r\nseems absolutely parched, and the air is like the breath of a furnace,\r\nthe blessed rain tree draws from somewhere abundant moisture, which it\r\ndistills in a heavy shower from its leaves, saturating all the earth\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nWhat could be more grateful to a hot and thirsty traveller than this\r\ntree, bringing moisture from the very air of the burning desert?\r\n\r\nClosely allied to the African rain tree is our next tree, brought to\r\nour grove from Ferro, the smallest island of the Canary group. This\r\nisland is so dry that scarcely a rivulet or spring is found there, but\r\non its rocks grows a tree with narrow leaves that are green all the\r\nyear. A constant dewy cloud surrounds this tree, and is condensed,\r\ndripping from the leaf points like the swift patter of a summer shower.\r\nUnder the branches the natives place cisterns and great jars, which are\r\nkept always full by the copious supply provided by these trees.[61]\r\n\r\nComing from the South Sea Islands, where there are so many marvels,\r\nsee next in our wonder grove the bread tree. The tree is of moderate\r\nheight, with large glossy leaves. The fruit is of about the size of\r\na Hubbard squash, and tastes like bread that has a little sugar in\r\nit. It is eaten raw, and is also cooked in various ways. The natives\r\nusually roast it in the ashes, as the negroes of the South roast yams.\r\nThe bread fruit forms the most important food staple of the South Sea\r\nIslands, but is not so nourishing as the yam, wheat, or corn; children\r\nfed entirely upon it lose flesh and strength. The bread tree never\r\nfinds an “off year” in bearing, nor a dull season; it is laden with\r\ngood fruit every year and all the year. From the timber the natives can\r\nbuild their boats, and they make cloth from the bark. So with a rain\r\ntree, a milk tree, and a bread-fruit tree one could do very well for\r\nfood, drink, shelter, and clothing.\r\n\r\nAs we have here in our wonder grove a bread tree, it is proper to put\r\na milk tree close by its side. Water, bread, milk, these three trees\r\nof our collection afford all that is needful to support life. But the\r\nmilk-producer, the cow tree, is not a native of Africa; it grows in\r\nSouth America, on the dry plains of Venezuela, where food and drink\r\nare alike hard to obtain. Blessed then be the shadow of this admirable\r\ntree, the hope of the perishing. The cow tree rises to a noble height.\r\nIts straight smooth trunk lifts into the air seventy or eighty feet\r\nbefore a branch springs from it. Then the wide arms extend in fair\r\nproportions on every side, until the topmost twig is more than a\r\nhundred feet from the ground. Tap the trunk anywhere, and an abundant\r\nsap, having the appearance and taste of rich new milk or cream, flows\r\nto revive the thirsty. The sap of our sugar maple runs freely only in\r\nearly spring, the sap of the cow tree is always ready.\r\n\r\nWhat more appropriate than to place the butter tree beside the milk\r\ntree? So we have placed it in our wonder grove, but nature planted it\r\nelsewhere, for the butter tree grows in Africa. The butter of this\r\ntree does not flow spontaneously. If people want butter it seems they\r\nmust take the trouble to make it, even if it comes from a tree. The\r\nbutter tree produces a fruit with a very rich kernel. When this kernel\r\nis ground, the oil exudes and hardens into a fine quality of butter,\r\nwhich will keep sweet for a year. David Livingstone, the celebrated\r\nmissionary traveller, made known to the world the virtues of the butter\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nNext let us have a tree that produces a fashion of confectionery. The\r\nmanna tree grows in Calabria and Sicily. In August the tree is tapped,\r\nand the sap slowly exudes, hardening under the hot southern sun to\r\nthe consistency of fig paste. The flavor of the manna while sweet is\r\nsickish to those unaccustomed to it. A taste for it seems to come by\r\nhabit. The product of the manna tree is by no means so rich and useful\r\nas that of our beautiful sugar maple, but the sap of the maple must be\r\nprepared for use by boiling.\r\n\r\nNext to the confectionery tree let us place in our grove a medicine\r\ntree. Who has not seen camphor, the clear white aromatic gum, so useful\r\nin medicine and in the arts? This is the product of the camphor tree of\r\nJapan. In Borneo, China, and the Malay Peninsula, the camphor trees\r\nhave the gum formed in the trunk in large lumps. The camphor of other\r\ncountries is obtained by boiling the wood of the camphor trees, and\r\nthen crystallizing the camphor so obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] This tree, called by the natives the Til-tree, has almost entirely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXX.\r\n\r\nSTILL IN THE WONDER GROVE.\r\n\r\n    “Thus the seer\r\n    With vision clear\r\n    Sees forms appear and disappear;\r\n    In the perpetual round of strange\r\n    Mysterious change.”\r\n\r\n                        --LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wonders of our grove are not yet exhausted. Indeed we might spend\r\na lifetime here, if we studied thoroughly its curiosities. We can only\r\nlook cursorily at a few more marvellous plants.\r\n\r\nHere is a tree from Jamaica, called the life tree because it grows so\r\nreadily, and is so tenacious of existence. The life tree will grow in\r\na wet place or in a dry one; it cannot be killed by cutting down, for\r\nevery fibre of its roots seems to possess power to renew the tree. Cut\r\nthe leaves from the plant one by one, and where you drop them on the\r\nground they grow, sending forth a root from any one of the severed ribs\r\nor veins. Cut the leaves into fragments and the fragments will grow.\r\n\r\nThis power in leaves to send forth rootlets and start a new plant, is\r\nnot confined to the life tree. Gardeners will tell you that the plants\r\nof the begonia tribe are grown by cutting off a portion of one of the\r\nlarge handsome leaves which distinguish the begonias, and sticking\r\nit in a little damp sandy soil. It soon roots and sends up vigorous\r\nleaf-stems.\r\n\r\nBeside the life tree behold its complement the death plant of Java,\r\ncalled by the Javanese the kali-mujah. This is a beautiful plant,\r\ngrowing nearly four feet high, with long, slender stems having\r\nupon them thorns an inch in length. These stems are crowded with\r\nbroad leaves, thick, smooth as satin, heart-shaped, on one side a\r\ndelicate emerald green, and on the other a vivid crimson marked with\r\ncream-color. From the midst of the leaf-stems rise the flower scapes,\r\nwell guarded about the blossom with fine, briar-like thorns. The\r\nblossoms are milk-white, about the size and shape of a large cup. These\r\nbeautiful flowers pour out a strong perfume, which, though agreeable,\r\nis overpowering and has poisonous qualities. If persons inhale this\r\nfragrance for several minutes, they become faint, and then unconscious;\r\nif shut up with the plant in a close room even a strong man would soon\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nInsects that hover about the flower fall dead, and birds that come,\r\nattracted by its red, white, and green splendors, wheel dizzily about\r\nit and drop unconscious. Even at a distance of three feet the breath of\r\nthe kali-mujah will kill a bird or insect, and will give a man a severe\r\nheadache with convulsive twitching of the muscles of the face. Other\r\nplants seem to avoid the kali-mujah, for none will grow in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nBut here is a more cheerful specimen. It should be the joy of all\r\nboys,--the whistling tree from Nubia. Day and night, year in and year\r\nout, this merry tree whistles tunes of its own composing--chorister of\r\ntrees! The leaves and stems are so constructed that this tree becomes\r\na shrill musical instrument, whistling loud and clear, even when no\r\nwind seems to be stirring. We have all noticed the shiver and murmur in\r\na grove of pines, even in the hot stillness of a summer noontide; the\r\nwhistling tree like the pine never ceases its peculiar music.\r\n\r\nOur next wonder plant grows in water; it is a cousin of our white\r\npond-lily, it is the _Victoria regia_ which grows in still pools in the\r\nAmazon region. The leaves are round, and are from six to eight feet\r\nin diameter. They are sharply turned up at the edge to form a rim, so\r\nthat each leaf is like a plate, the under surface is crimson, the upper\r\nsurface green with fine lines; on this elegant plate the flower lies.\r\n\r\nLet us watch a blossom open. About half-past eight in the evening\r\nthe bud has slowly lifted itself above the pond, where it had grown\r\nsubmerged. Once free from the water it shakes and quivers, as if\r\nendowed with conscious life, and presently from the folded flower one\r\npetal flies open; then for a little it rests; then is again agitated,\r\nand a second petal expands. Then the agitation continues, the bud\r\nflutters and trembles, and petal after petal spreads out; then a dozen\r\nat a time are released from their close clasping, and at last behold\r\nthe great flower, two feet wide across its snow and gold centre, a\r\nhundred snow-white petals composing the perfected bloom. From the whole\r\nblossom exhales a delicate, rich, delicious perfume, harmless as the\r\nbreath of violets. The sun rises; the white petals bend together, and,\r\nrocked on the parent pool, the _Victoria regia_ sleeps.\r\n\r\nBut as night draws on again the royal lily awakes. Now it is in its\r\nperfection; the perfume is more subtle; the petals take a flush of the\r\npalest pink; it rocks on the water and queens it through the night. And\r\nso with a few waking and sleeping nights and days, the royal lily’s\r\nlife is done.[62] When the splendid blossoms and the vast green leaves\r\nhave perished the seed boxes or pods of the plant rise above the water\r\nand ripen, and the Indians call them water maize, and eat them.\r\n\r\nNext to the lovely Regia let us place the century plant. The old notion\r\nwas that this “American aloe” bloomed only after one hundred years of\r\ngrowth. _Agave Americana_ is its true name, and when growing in a cool\r\nclimate it is very slow in attaining maturity. At any time between ten\r\nand seventy years of age, it may send up a very tall flower stalk,\r\ncovered with large greenish yellow blossoms, which continue open for\r\nseveral months. As soon as it has finished flowering it dies.\r\n\r\nThere are many members of the cactus and orchid families which might\r\nappropriately be planted in our grove of wonders, to light it up with\r\ntheir beauty, and amaze us with the marvels of their structure. But for\r\nthat matter not a plant that grows lacks mysteries and marvels.\r\n\r\nOf all strange, abnormal plants the carnivorous, or flesh-eating, are\r\nthe most singular. Several members of this family were described in\r\nNature Reader, No. 3. Those were all small and pretty plants, green\r\nwith dull red or yellow marks or tinges, and fatal only to little\r\ninsects which were lured by the glittering bait of honey drops spread\r\nout for them.\r\n\r\nNow let us introduce a native of Australia, called the stinging tree.\r\nNo wasp, or hornet, ever had a sharper sting. Dreaded by all who know\r\nit, the stinging tree is yet a beautiful object. It is only twelve\r\nfeet high and has dark, glossy, green leaves, and large bunches of\r\nscarlet berries. The tree grows always in a cone shape and reminds one\r\nof a Christmas-tree lighted with red candles. But at the tip of each\r\nprojection of the green, saucer-shaped leaf grows a deadly thorn. The\r\nleast touch of one of these thorns fills a man or beast with a terrible\r\npain. Beasts act as if seized with hydrophobia; human beings stung by\r\nthis tree are partly paralyzed, and suffer agony for days, or even\r\nweeks. The dry leaf, wind-blown, is able to effect as serious a sting\r\nas the leaf still on the cruel tree. Dogs and horses that have come in\r\ncontact with one of these thorns must be killed at once, as in their\r\npain they become dangerous.\r\n\r\nLet us turn from this cruel stinging tree to one more useful and\r\npleasant, the soap tree of Chili. This is a large, handsome tree with\r\ndark green leaves, casting a delightful shade. When the rough, outer\r\nbark is stripped away, behold under it a smooth, white bark, which,\r\nground to powder, affords a soap nearly as good as any that you can\r\nbuy. Who need have dirty hands or soiled clothing when a soap tree\r\ngrows close beside his door? “Odd bark that,” do you say? Come to this\r\nnext tree and we will show you a yet more wonderful bark.\r\n\r\nHave you any jugs or bottles to cork? Do you want some cork soles? Here\r\nis the tree on which they grow. This is the great cork tree of Spain.\r\nIt is found in many parts of South Europe and on the North African\r\ncoast, but Spain is the land where cork collecting is a chief industry.\r\nWhen you take a cork in your hand, let it be as the enchanted stone,\r\nto carry you away to the warm hills of Spain, where you may see the\r\nlaughing, black-eyed Spanish boys and girls running about to help the\r\ncork gatherers.\r\n\r\nOur cork tree is thirty feet high, with well-spread branches, and a\r\ntrunk very stout in proportion to the size of the tree. This trunk\r\nis covered with a thick, tough, elastic bark, which is constantly\r\nincreased from within, growing thicker and thicker. When the trees are\r\nbetween fifteen and twenty years old, the bark is stripped off for the\r\nfirst time. This first bark is coarse and is used only for tanning,\r\nand for rough work. After eight or ten years the bark is stripped off\r\nagain, and this time it is finer, and good enough for net-floats, and\r\nother coarse work, as life-preservers and buoys.\r\n\r\nHowever, in eight or ten years more another coat can be stripped off,\r\nand this is fine and beautiful cork that will bring a good price. A\r\ncork tree will live for one hundred and fifty years, during which time\r\nthe bark may be regularly stripped at intervals of eight or ten years.\r\nThe stripping is done in July and August by making a cut entirely\r\naround the stem, just above the ground, and a second cut just below\r\nthe branches, then three cuts are made lengthwise the tree, and the\r\nbark is taken off in long strips. The greatest care is used to avoid\r\ninjuring the inner bark. These slabs of bark are heated and slightly\r\nscorched; this causes them to flatten, closes up the pores, and gives\r\ntoughness to the whole material. What should we do without cork for\r\njackets, cork legs and arms, cork apparatus in lifeboats, and other\r\nappliances for saving people from drowning? Our cork tree with its\r\nmarvellous bark is by no means the least valuable specimen in our\r\nwonder grove.\r\n\r\nWhat is this beautiful tree, tall and stately, with delicate oblong\r\nleaves, lovely flowers, and fruit like a plum? It is the tree from\r\nwhich our gutta percha comes, and without that valuable product what\r\nshould we do for many instruments, for piping, and for a good covering\r\nfor telegraph wires? As the Chinese and Malays always cut down these\r\nnoble trees to get the juice which hardens into gutta percha, sometimes\r\nthree or four millions of the trees are killed each year. At that rate\r\nthey will all soon be gone.\r\n\r\nWhat next? Why, the tree that bears india-rubber toys, overshoes, and\r\nwater-proof coats. By good luck the people of South America, Central\r\nAmerica, Asia, and Africa, where the varieties of india-rubber, or\r\ncaoutchouc, producing trees are found, have learned to tap the trees\r\nand take care of them and do not kill them for a single harvest. The\r\nrubber is the hardened juice of the tree; when it first runs out it is\r\nlike milk or cream, and hardens very quickly. It is sent to market in\r\nflat cakes called “biscuits.” Trees producing various kinds of “rubber”\r\nabound in most tropical countries.\r\n\r\nNow, finally, here is yet another specimen in our grove, a small\r\nshrub, only a tree by courtesy, but one of the wonders of the world,\r\nnevertheless, and happily a harmless curiosity,--if let alone! This is\r\nthe electric plant.\r\n\r\nWe have long known of the electric eel, and the electric fish, that can\r\ngive a powerful shock to anything touching them. A French naturalist\r\nhas found and investigated, in the forests of India, a shrub endowed\r\nwith amazing magnetic powers. At a distance of six yards it affects the\r\nmagnetic needle.\r\n\r\nIf you break a leaf from the plant, you receive a powerful shock. Touch\r\nit with the tips of your fingers, and you receive a shock as from an\r\ninduction coil. No birds or insects light upon it, they know the result\r\ntoo well; it would be certain death. How do birds and insects learn\r\nwhat is safe and what is dangerous for them to do? I cannot tell you.\r\n\r\nNo electric metals are found in the vicinity of this shrub. The\r\nelectricity belongs solely to the plant. At two in the afternoon the\r\nelectricity is at its height; at night the plant nearly loses its\r\ncurious properties. This is no doubt owing to the dewy dampness of\r\nnight; for during a rain the electricity is also lost, and one can then\r\nbreak off a leaf with impunity. During an electric storm its intensity\r\nredoubles, so that the shrub becomes nearly as dangerous as an electric\r\nwire.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[62] Some of the highest authorities state that in its native waters\r\nthe Regia blossom lasts but one day and two nights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXI.\r\n\r\nA NOISY FAMILY.\r\n\r\n    “When the hounds of spring are on winter’s traces,\r\n      The mother of months in meadow or plain\r\n    Fills the shadows and windy places\r\n      With lisp of leaves and ripple of rain.”\r\n\r\n                                    --A. C. SWINBURNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BROTHER HOP O’ MY THUMB.]\r\n\r\nPassing one day beside one of those shallow basins that are dug out\r\nof the clay soil of the west, to collect the rainfall and to serve as\r\nwatering-places for stock, I saw a strange sight. Above the brown and\r\nturbid water projected a row of green and yellow roundish knobs. These\r\nwere placed at intervals eight or ten inches apart, nearly around the\r\nedge of the basin. Looking closer, I saw that at the base of each\r\nknob were two bright, prominent eyes. I laughed, as who would not,\r\nconsidering this living wreath encircling the pond. I had never before\r\nseen frogs drawn up in such orderly array.\r\n\r\nFor frogs these were, silent and alert. Whether fear or the heat of\r\nthe day had driven them to this position I could not tell. Presently\r\none of the bronze-green knobs elevated itself a little, became evident\r\nhead and shoulders, rose above the surface of the water with a hop,\r\nand paused on the muddy edge of the basin for further observations.\r\nWatching carefully I saw that all the knobs moved now and again with\r\na quick, bobbing motion. Connecting this motion with the sudden and\r\nfinal disappearance of numerous insects flying low over the water, I\r\ndiscovered that the neatly ambushed frogs were taking their supper.\r\nPresently I tossed a stone lightly into the pond, and at once, with a\r\nplash all the noses vanished. A little later, as twilight fell, a loud\r\nclangor of dissonant voices told that my frogs were engaged in their\r\nevening concert. A family of vocalists are these frogs.\r\n\r\nThe other day I passed this same pond. A winter of sunny weeks, with\r\nneither rain nor snow, had caused the water to dry away until only a\r\nfew inches lay over the mud in the centre of the hollow.\r\n\r\n“Where are all our frogs?” asked Hermie. “Frogs hibernate,” I said. “As\r\nwinter closes in they bury themselves in masses in the mud under the\r\nwater. Some degree of moisture is needful to them at all times, and the\r\nmud affords all the dampness and warmth necessary. If the pond dries\r\naway, and the mud hardens about them, so that they cannot get out,\r\nthey may live in their imprisonment for a number of months.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard,” said Hermie, “that frogs have lived shut up in lumps of\r\ncoal, in rocks, and in trees, for a great many years. Do you believe\r\nthat?”\r\n\r\n“I should want more reliable witnesses and more accurate information\r\nthan have ever yet appeared in behalf of these tales. Experiments have\r\nshown that frogs and toads soon die if entirely shut away from air and\r\nfood, though with a very little air and food they can live a long time\r\nshut up in wood or clay. An old man told me he had seen a frog taken\r\nout of a rock, where it had been buried five hundred years, and when\r\nit came out it _howled_. Now I know that a frog cannot howl,[63] and I\r\nconcluded that one part of this marvellous tale was as untrue as the\r\nother.”\r\n\r\nThe frogs, whose scientific name is Ranidæ, belong to the lower\r\nvertebrates, and are the largest family of their order. They are\r\nscarcely known in Australia and South America, and reach their highest\r\nstate in the East Indies.\r\n\r\nAmong the best known of the Ranidæ in England and North America is the\r\nbull-frog, noted for his large size, his noisy voice, his green coat\r\nlaced with gold, and his silvery vest. The most curious forms of frogs\r\nare found in South America. The Oceanic Islands usually have very few\r\nexamples of the order. Frogs can endure great changes of heat and cold,\r\nand can live on land as well as in water, provided they have the amount\r\nof moisture needed to preserve the suppleness of the skin; but salt\r\nwater is fatal to the frog in any stage of its existence.\r\n\r\nFor the study of the Ranidæ let us return to the representative best\r\nknown to us, the lusty croaker of the summer pond. The frog dressed in\r\ngreen, silver, bronze, and gold is an expert swimmer, a mighty leaper,\r\nan ear-splitting vocalist, aquatic in his tastes, never wandering far\r\nfrom his native pond except when sent to market, and thence served up\r\nat the table as a dainty. But on the table we should not know him for\r\nour frog; only his hind quarters appear, and these skinned and fried\r\nare much like the legs of a spring chicken.\r\n\r\nA most harmless, timid, and interesting beastie is the frog, and often\r\nmost unfortunate, being considered a legitimate mark for all the stones\r\nthat can be thrown at him by urchins wandering around his native pool.\r\nMoreover, he is filled with mortal terror when with stately progress a\r\nswan or a goose sails over the water or searches in the herbage where\r\nhe hides.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do to give this victim of geese and small boys a certain\r\nhuman interest, and win for him from the boys respect and friendship,\r\nrather than pelting? Let us look at him. We have described the colors\r\nof his skin, which is smooth, having no scales or plates. The yellow\r\ncolor is laid upon the bronze-green ground in stripes and spots, the\r\nstripes extending from the nose to the end of the back with a shorter\r\nstripe on each side. The front feet or hands are divided into four\r\nfingers, and the front legs are much shorter, smaller, and weaker than\r\nthe hind ones, which are largely developed, and are used in swimming\r\nand leaping. The feet of the hind legs are webbed and have five fingers\r\nor toes.\r\n\r\nThe frog has a backbone, but no ribs. As he is ribless he cannot expand\r\nand contract his chest in breathing, so that he must swallow what air\r\nhe wants. In swallowing air he must close his mouth and take the air in\r\nonly by the nostrils; therefore, oddly enough, if his mouth is forcibly\r\nkept open he may be smothered.[64] The frog’s breathing is partly\r\nthrough its skin, which gives off carbonic acid gas; and moisture is as\r\nneedful to a frog’s skin as to the gills of a fish.[65] The frog likes\r\ndamp, rainy weather, and is as fond as a child of playing in a puddle.\r\nAs soon as rain falls out come the frogs. The frog’s skin absorbs\r\nmoisture, which it stores up in an internal reservoir. When a frog is\r\nalarmed by being suddenly seized, it ejects some of this water. People\r\nhave fancied that such water was poisonous, but it is not. Frogs have\r\nno poison sacs, and no weapons. Toads also give out a fluid from the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nOpen our frog’s mouth. There are a few tiny teeth on the upper jaw\r\nand palate; these are for partially grinding up horny insects. See\r\nthis odd tongue; it is fastened at the front end to the mouth, and\r\nthe hinder part is free and hangs down the creature’s throat. This\r\ntongue is covered with a glue-like secretion, and when an insect is\r\nto be captured the tongue is snapped forward from the mouth, and the\r\ninsect adheres as to bird-lime. Some frogs have cheek-pouches, and some\r\ndrum-like throat-plates, wherewith to make their loud croak.\r\n\r\nWhat is the life history of our frog? From seed to seed is plant-life\r\nstory; from egg to egg is frog story. The eggs of the frog are\r\ndeposited in roundish masses attached to sticks lying in water, or to\r\nthe stems and leaves of submerged water-plants. The creature which\r\ncomes from this egg is no more like a frog, than a caterpillar is like\r\na butterfly. It has a big head and no limbs, and what of it is not head\r\nseems to be tail. In fact, in this stage the creature is more like a\r\nfish than a frog, and has branched gills. The gills are nearly covered\r\nby a fold of skin. Have you seen it? It is a tadpole. This tadpole can\r\nlive only in water, and swims and feeds from the first instant of its\r\nfree life. Change in its shape begins almost immediately: the branched\r\ngills are drawn within the neck and hidden; a pair of fore-legs begin\r\nto bud, and then a pair of hind-legs bud and push out faster than\r\nthe fore-legs. As the legs grow the tail is gradually absorbed and\r\ndisappears. Meanwhile the interior of the body changes; the lungs and\r\nheart become like those of a reptile. When first the tadpole emerged\r\nfrom the egg it ate the jelly-like egg cover: then, by means of a pair\r\nof little horny jaws, it ate soft animal or vegetable matter. When its\r\ngills and tail are gone, and its legs are fully formed, it hops out of\r\nthe water a perfectly formed frog.\r\n\r\nTadpoles feed on insects and also on each other. They are admirable\r\npreparers of small skeletons. Try the tadpole at this trade; drop into\r\nhis pond a dead mouse, or bird, or frog, or squirrel. Soon you will\r\nfind a clean, white skeleton, nice enough to put in any museum.\r\n\r\nThe food of the adult frog is chiefly insects. Less hungry than when in\r\nthe tadpole state,--for the tadpole like the child must not only eat\r\nto live but to grow--the frog is not often tempted to vary his diet.\r\n\r\nThe frog, seated in cool leaf shadows, watches with his great, black,\r\ngold-ringed eyes for such insects as good fortune shall send past his\r\nretreat. As one hovers near, out flies his limber, sticky, notched,\r\nribbon-like tongue, true to its mark. The insect adheres to the viscous\r\nsurface of the projected ribbon, and is gently deposited in the open\r\nthroat. During this process the frog maintains a calm, superior,\r\nself-satisfied expression, as if in this still hunt he not so much\r\nsatisfied an appetite, as fulfilled a mission of ridding nature of\r\nsuperfluous insects. He seems to have no malice toward the insects; he\r\nis merely giving them an honorable burial, and saving them from the\r\nfurther perplexities of life.\r\n\r\nThe common frog attains a length of three or four inches.[66] He\r\nhas glandular ridges down the skin of his back, and these, with his\r\ncolors, singularly fit him for his home: the darker ridges imitating\r\nplant-stems; the green coat, leafage; the silver vest, the glimmer\r\nof water; the brownish feet and markings, the moist earth; while the\r\nyellow markings add to the protective display, in being like the\r\nstamens and pistils of surrounding flowers, and of the hue of many\r\nbuds and blossoms. Thus the frog in his native haunts is protected by\r\nhis garments, and is little likely to be seen unless he moves, or is\r\nbetrayed by his full, bright eyes or the palpitations of his breast.\r\n\r\nWhile the common frog represents the aquatic Ranidæ, his cousin,\r\nthe wood-frog, represents a branch of the widely distributed family\r\nwhich prefers dry dwellings, except in the breeding season, when the\r\neggs must be deposited in water. The wood-frog is smaller than the\r\nbull-frog, and is dressed in olive-green and shades of brown, like the\r\ncolors of dead leaves and dry twigs. There is a large black patch on\r\nthe side of the head around the big ear-drum. The wood-frog takes such\r\nenormous leaps that it is very difficult to catch. It is shy, and makes\r\na prodigious jump at the first hint of danger. When it drops to the\r\nground it is scarcely discernible from the dry vegetation about it. The\r\nwood-frog maintains the moisture of its skin by hiding in damp moss or\r\nin decayed logs, and in little hollows in the ground. It avoids the\r\nsunshine, and keeps close to the earth.\r\n\r\nThe tree-frog is another curious frog. Smaller than its cousins, it\r\nis dressed in bright green, spotted with black, and has a membrane\r\nstretched between its toes, which gives its feet a broad, flat surface,\r\nand helps to sustain it as it leaps from branch to branch, somewhat\r\nin the fashion of a flying squirrel. In tropical lands, where many\r\ntrees are decked with gorgeous blossoms, tree-frogs appear very gaily\r\ncolored, the splendor of the coat being protective in such surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe swamp-frog is dressed in black and light brown, and lives in\r\nmarshes in the Eastern United States. Its voice is a prolonged croak.\r\nThe clamata, or “bawling-frog,” lives about cold, damp springs, and is\r\nvery noisy. The resounding roar of the bull-frog is a well-known sound.\r\nNo wonder that Horace, the Roman poet, wrote that “the noisy frogs\r\nfrom the marshes drive away sleep.”\r\n\r\nCats, geese, owls, vultures, hawks, otters, and other creatures eat\r\nfrogs, and the luckless creatures can hardly appear without finding\r\nan enemy. To balance this destruction of their forces they produce\r\ngreat numbers of eggs. When tadpoles first reach the frog state they\r\nare black. I have seen hundreds of them together, so that the pond mud\r\nseemed alive and crawling.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[63] Frogs and toads sometimes squeal or cry with pain or terror.\r\n\r\n[64] As these animals respire also through the skin they may live\r\nsometime without breathing through the nostrils.\r\n\r\n[65] See Nature Reader, No. 3, Lesson 40.\r\n\r\n[66] Our large bull-frog is eight or twelve inches long. Frogs even one\r\nor two feet long (Holder’s Zoölogy) have been found, but such a size is\r\nvery unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE FROG’S COUSIN.\r\n\r\n    “Sweet are the uses of adversity,\r\n    Which like a toad, ugly and venomous,\r\n    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.”\r\n\r\n                         --_As You Like It._\r\n\r\n\r\nBelonging to the same class of vertebrates as the frog, to the same\r\norder also, but to a different sub-order, are the toads, the cousins of\r\nthe frogs. As the frog is well known about the ponds, so the toad is a\r\nconstant inhabitant of our groves and gardens. We introduce the frog\r\nto an admiring public as Mr. Rana, the toad as Mr. Bufo. The order to\r\nwhich the frogs and toads belong is divided according to the structure\r\nof the base of the skull and the shape of the shoulder girdle. In\r\ngeneral anatomy the frogs and toads are alike. The eggs and young are\r\nclosely similar, and the stages of growth from egg to the adult form\r\nare nearly identical. When the adult form is reached the frogs and\r\ntoads are yet very tiny creatures, but small as they are the most\r\ncasual observer can distinguish them from each other by the shape of\r\nthe snout, and by the far larger development of the hind-legs of the\r\nfrog.\r\n\r\nThe chief differences to be noted between Mr. Rana and his cousin, Mr.\r\nBufo, are these: the toad has no teeth, but the frog, as we have seen,\r\nhas teeth on the upper jaw and palate. The attachment of the tongue\r\nis the same, but the free end of the frog’s tongue is forked, and the\r\ntoad’s is not. The toad’s skin is usually warty, the frog’s is smooth;\r\nthe toad has a rounder body, shorter hind-legs, and its feet are less\r\nfully webbed; its snout is more rounded than that of the frog.\r\n\r\nWe find, let us say, a toad and a frog in our morning ramble. We notice\r\nthe soft, moist skin and say, “These are amphibians.” We see that they\r\nare tailless, and we say they are anurans, or tailless amphibians. Then\r\nhaving placed them together thus far, we note their differences, and\r\nwe say of the frog, “This belongs to the Ranidæ,” and of the smaller\r\ncousin, “Here is one of the Bufonidæ.” Of the two, we may find the\r\ntoad the more interesting animal, as among its kinsfolk are some very\r\nremarkable families.\r\n\r\nMr. Bufo is a citizen of the world, except of the severely cold polar\r\nregions. He hops through the tropics and the temperate zones, and goes\r\npretty well up into the polar regions; an inoffensive, gentle, humble,\r\nuseful, and generally utterly silent creature. No person is faultless,\r\nand Bufo is not superior to humans in that no evil may be laid to his\r\ncharge. He does eat bees. Happy is Mr. Bufo when, brigand-like, he can\r\nstand by the highway of the bees returning laden with wealth of honey\r\nand entering their waxen city. He holds his captives for no ransom, he\r\nscarcely stays to kill them, but swallows them alive and whole, and\r\ndigests them later.\r\n\r\nAs far as we know, this bee-eating is Bufo’s one fault; to\r\ncounterbalance it he devours millions of harmful insects, and\r\nso assuredly saves the world thousands of bushels of fruit and\r\nvegetables. We will not say that Bufo is greedy in eating. It is true\r\nthat he swallows insects ceaselessly and swiftly, so much so that a\r\ngrasshopper’s legs, or some other creature’s antennæ, may sometimes be\r\nseen sticking out of a toad’s mouth, while the carcass is well down his\r\nthroat--but we will not be hard on him; we call this--zealous attention\r\nto business. The French gardeners appreciate Bufo’s usefulness, and he\r\nis brought alive to market to be sold to those who need his help in\r\ntheir gardens.\r\n\r\nBufo can be tamed and taught to eat from your hand. He can be beguiled\r\nwith sugar, and with bread soaked in milk. As to this last dainty, like\r\na captious child, he eats out the middle of the slice and leaves the\r\ncrust!\r\n\r\nThere are three myths about the toad: first, that he can live during\r\ncenturies shut up in clay or stone; this is no more true of Bufo than\r\nof his cousin Rana. The second myth is that his skin when handled\r\ncauses warts, and that the fluid he discharges is poisonous; this is an\r\nidle tale. The third allegation is, that he has a jewel in his head.\r\nThis has been believed from very ancient times; perhaps the story rose\r\nfrom the beauty of his eyes, with their iris of flame-color.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the toad are deposited closely set side by side in a long\r\ntransparent tube which is dropped into water, and sinking to the bottom\r\ncoils up until the eggs hatch. The young tadpoles are jet black and\r\nvery active. They make all their changes very early and in the same\r\nmanner as the frog, and are quite small when they arrive at the perfect\r\ntoad-shape. As soon as they have produced four legs and their tails\r\nhave been absorbed, they leave the water and set off on long journeys;\r\nfor the toad is a born vagrant, and not, like the frog, a home-stayer.\r\n\r\nAvoiding the sun’s heat they travel chiefly by night, and by day hide\r\nunder stones or herbage. If clouds cover the sky they take heart and\r\nhop forth on their pilgrimage. During a long drought they disappear,\r\nbut if a rain comes they suddenly swarm out by hundreds, and thus have\r\narisen the tales of a “shower of toads.”\r\n\r\nGoing one day into my garden, I saw under my favorite rose tree a\r\nlittle hollow in the loose earth. It looked just like the cup-shaped\r\nimpression made by an egg half buried in the ground. An hour later, I\r\nfound a toad seated in this place, which he had evidently fashioned\r\nfor himself in order to preserve the moisture of his body, while he\r\nhunted for his dinner. His keen, black eyes were fixed on the drooping\r\nstem and leaves of the rose-bush, and out and in played his little\r\nribbon-like tongue, capturing an insect at every dart.\r\n\r\nThe toad feeds on worms as well as flies, and when after a rain the\r\nworms and toads are mutually inspired to take their walks abroad, many\r\na luckless worm finds its way into the toad’s maw. He never eats a dead\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nIn winter the toad hibernates like the frog, and since the young toad\r\nreaches its adult size in the autumn, it passes the first period of\r\nits grown-up life in a sleep, or coma, in some hole or burrow which\r\nit has found or fashioned in the earth. Sometimes toads creep into\r\nrock-crevices or into hollows in logs and trees, and being found in\r\nthese places early in the spring, are hastily supposed to have been\r\nprisoners for many years.\r\n\r\nThe toad, as well as the frog, casts its skin in the process of growth.\r\nWhen the skin has become too small, and the shedding approaches, the\r\nwhite, green, and brown colors of the coat become dull, and a peculiar\r\ndryness appears. A new skin is forming under the outgrown one, which\r\npresently splits in half down the middle of the back and the under part\r\nof the body. The toad now begins to twist and twitch, and the old skin\r\nwrinkles and folds along the sides. Then the toad tucks a hind-leg\r\nunder his forearm, and gives a good pull, and lo, he is out of that leg\r\nof his trousers. Then the other leg comes off in the same style. Next\r\nhe puts one of his hands in his mouth, and giving a jerk, off comes the\r\ncovering of that hand and arm, like a discarded glove. Then off with\r\nthe other. Now then, what? Why, he rolls the outgrown skin into a neat\r\nball and swallows it. No second-hand clothes sold or given away by Mr.\r\nBufo. The frog strips off and disposes of his skin in the same way.\r\n\r\nToads and frogs can change to some extent the color of their skins to\r\nsuit their homes. Toads kept in the dark with dark surroundings become\r\ndark in color; and those kept in light with white or light accessories\r\nbecome lighter; but the color of the toad changes more slowly than\r\nthat of the frog. The arrangement of the color does not alter; the\r\nchange is merely from light to dark.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at some curious specimens of the Bufonidæ. The pipa, or\r\nSurinam toad, does not lay its eggs in water. The mother toad places\r\nthe eggs on her back, and a fold of skin rising up encloses each egg\r\nin a separate cell, until the young have not only hatched, but have\r\npassed through all their metamorphoses, and come out fully formed.\r\nAnother toad, common in Europe and Asia, is largely colored with bright\r\ncrimson, and the father toad carries the little ones in separate cells\r\nfastened to his hind-legs like chains. In these cells the little ones\r\nchange to their perfect shape, when the cells wither away and the young\r\ntoads hop out able to take care of themselves.\r\n\r\nWe said that toads were generally silent; a little toad about three\r\ninches long, called a “natter-jack,” is common in England and is a\r\nnoted singer, for a toad. His “gluck-gluck, gluck-k-k,” can be heard\r\nany night. The “green toad,” well known on the continent, is not so\r\nnoisy as the natter-jack, but has a low, moaning cry.\r\n\r\nAll the true tree-toads, or Hylidæ, have clear, shrill voices,[67]\r\nand are fond of singing serenades. Like tree-frogs, tree-toads have\r\nthe ends of the toes dilated into flat plates, or disks, which render\r\ntheir footing more secure as they hop among the branches. Our American\r\nHylidæ are small, green-colored with brown markings, but in Asia they\r\nare often brightly colored. One very pretty little Hyla lives near\r\nponds, and seated on the hard leaves of water-plants sings its shrill\r\nmonotonous song.\r\n\r\nAll summer, from early April, the Hylidæ trill and sing, but as the\r\nautumn frosts come, their songs begin earlier and last longer. As\r\nthe red and yellow leaves fall in showers from the trees, and the\r\ngolden-rod and asters begin to faint and die among the sere grasses,\r\nthe Hylidæ seem to be singing their requiem, and bewailing the coming\r\nof winter.\r\n\r\nAnother toad with a voice is the spade-foot. This toad is rare\r\nthough widely distributed; it is remarkable for its feet, shaped for\r\ndigging, its subterranean habits, and its curious way of appearing\r\nand disappearing very suddenly. After a rainy season the spade-foot\r\nwill come out from some hiding-place, attract attention by loud cries,\r\nswarm by hundreds about ponds, lay innumerable eggs,--and vanish. But\r\nwhile thousands of eggs are laid, scores only hatch, for most of them\r\nperish from being laid so near the water’s edge that the subsidence of\r\nthe water leaves them to dry up. While scores hatch, only tens grow\r\nup; for the spade-foot tadpoles devour one another, and are so greedy\r\nthat very few survive. These few are most ravenous in their appetites.\r\nA spade-foot tadpole will seize a grasshopper, and being too small to\r\nswallow over half his prey, will calmly lie waiting for the swallowed\r\nhalf to digest in order that he may gulp down the remainder. As soon\r\nas a spade-foot tadpole becomes a “hopper,” getting four legs and\r\nlosing its tail, it leaves the pond and indulges its digging instincts.\r\nIt scrapes out a house for itself, from eight inches to two feet in\r\nlength, and cheerfully takes up an underground residence.\r\n\r\nThus we find that toads have three different methods of life, some\r\nbeing arboreal, or tree dwellers, seldom appearing on the ground; some\r\nsubterranean, or underground dwellers seldom appearing on the surface;\r\nsome dwellers on the ground, hiding among grass and other herbage when\r\nasleep, or when the sun is too hot for their comfort. But all toads,\r\nexcept the two varieties mentioned above, which carry their young on\r\ntheir bodies, go to the water to drop their eggs, and the young live in\r\nthe water until they reach the adult state.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[67] In the spring the common toad takes to the water and there sings\r\nloudly. The loud continuous trill that we hear in swamps in springtime\r\nis made by toads, not by frogs, as is commonly supposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SALAMANDERS.\r\n\r\n    “The rarest things with wayward will\r\n      Beneath the covert hide them still;\r\n    The rarest things to break of day\r\n      Look shortly forth, and hie away.”\r\n\r\n                        --JOANNA BAILLIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrogs and toads belong to the class Batrachia, a division of\r\nvertebrates which stands intermediate between fishes and reptiles,\r\npartaking in the different stages of their lives of some of the\r\ncharacteristics of both these classes. The eggs of batrachians are\r\ngenerally laid in water or damp places, and the young breathe, not\r\nthrough lungs but through gills. To the class Batrachia belong not only\r\nfrogs and toads, but sirens, mud-fish, “water-dogs,” and salamanders,\r\nall of which are interesting animals. Among them there is a species of\r\nsalamander which is distinguished from all other batrachians, because\r\nits young ones are born alive.\r\n\r\nI remember reading when I was a child, of a very remarkable beast\r\ncalled a salamander, which could live in fire; and one of my books had\r\na thrilling description of one of these little animals which had come\r\nforth from a burning log in the midst of a blaze, and ran cheerfully\r\nabout in the flames, sporting and enjoying itself. This myth of the\r\nsuperiority of the salamander to fire is wide-spread and ancient. It\r\nis a common saying that a person who is not easily affected by heat is\r\n“a perfect salamander.” The stories of some old-time naturalists about\r\nthe salamanders are amusing. We are told that the creature can not\r\nonly live in fire, but is born in it; that passing through a fire it\r\nextinguishes it; that smiths finding the forge fires going out, always\r\nknew that a salamander was playing therein, and mended the fire by\r\nkilling the animal. Another myth was that the salamander was the most\r\npoisonous of all creatures; if it crawled over a person’s foot that\r\nperson’s entire body was poisoned, the hair fell out, and lingering\r\ndeath was the result; wood, over which a salamander had crept was\r\npoisonous; the creature’s breath was a deadly poison. Some thought the\r\nanimal wore hair, others that it wore feathers or fur, but all agreed\r\nthat cloth woven of its coat was fire-proof. Belief in these fantastic\r\nstories long survived.\r\n\r\nWhat is the truth? The salamander is not at all poisonous; on the\r\ncontrary, like most other batrachians, it is harmless and helpless,\r\nand obtains its bad name no doubt from its general lack of beauty,\r\nof either shape or color. It is ugly and therefore venomous, is the\r\nreasoning. This is hard. What if we should reason that a person is\r\nunhandsome and therefore vicious? The skin of the salamander is\r\nglandular, and is capable of secreting much fluid, and when the\r\ncreature is terrified or excited this secretion increases, and the\r\nfluid covers the skin. Owing to this fluid, a salamander which by any\r\nmeans finds itself in a fire, might move about for a minute or two\r\nlooking for an exit from the flames, and get out scatheless, thanks to\r\nits watery coat. Besides, these cold-blooded animals are to a certain\r\nextent insensitive upon the surface of the body, and would suffer\r\nlittle pain in a brief sojourn in a flame. The stories of salamanders\r\nsuddenly appearing in a fire as if born there, can be explained by the\r\nfact that they hide and sleep in decayed logs, under stones, or among\r\ndry, dead sticks, and so might be very likely to wake up in a fire\r\nkindled out of doors.\r\n\r\nThe largest of all the salamanders belongs in Asia, and is found in\r\nThibet and Japan. It is the largest of the batrachians, and is about\r\nthree feet in length. I once saw perhaps the largest specimen ever\r\nfound, the giant of salamanders. It was two feet, five inches high,\r\nfrom its soles to the top of the arch of its back, and three feet, five\r\ninches long from nose to tail tip. Its color was a rusty black, and its\r\nskin was covered with thick knobs or granulations, making it look as if\r\ndressed in very hard and old embossed leather armor.\r\n\r\nThe head of the salamander is large and rounded; the tail is stiff and\r\nelongated; the legs very short; the hind feet are five-toed, the front\r\nfeet have only four toes. The legs and feet are thick and clumsy, and\r\nthe larger salamanders are heavy and inert in their motions. Far from\r\nfinding fire their native or preferred element, the salamanders like\r\ncold, damp places; their eggs are dropped in water and hatch there,\r\nexcept those of the spotted salamander of Spain.\r\n\r\nThe young of these Spanish salamanders are at birth about half or three\r\nquarters of an inch long, with branched gills. They look like tadpoles\r\nor “pollywogs,” and at once take to the water and remain there until\r\nthey reach the adult form. The salamander larvæ grow to considerable\r\nsize before they make their final change of form. Their gills are very\r\nlarge, and as they swim about they look as if they had trimmed their\r\nnecks with foliage. In the water they find themselves very comfortable\r\nuntil they approach the adult period. Then they become restless and dig\r\nholes for themselves in the mud or sand of the streams or ponds where\r\nthey live. These lairs exactly fit their bodies, and are so placed that\r\nas they lie there with their heads out of water every slight rise or\r\nripple of the water will overflow them and keep the lairs well wet.\r\nThus they breathe in the water by their gills, and at the same time\r\npractice air-breathing; for their gills are now shrivelling away, and\r\nthey are progressing toward the air-breathing condition of the true\r\nsalamander state.\r\n\r\nA salamander much like the spotted one, but having no lighter spots on\r\nits skin, lives in high lands where there are no stagnant waters fit\r\nfor a resting-place for its eggs. This black salamander’s young ones\r\nare born two at a time, and are in all respects except size, precisely\r\nlike their parents.\r\n\r\nThe ash-colored salamander is common in the woods of the Eastern United\r\nStates. It is only a few inches long, but is not so small as its cousin\r\nthe “microscopic salamander,” a native of the Mississippi Valley, a\r\nlithe, brisk little creature, of a gray color, fond of hiding in logs\r\nand under bark or stones. Black, gray and dust-color are the usual\r\nshades of a salamander’s coat, but in the Rocky Mountains some may be\r\nfound adorned with red, yellow, and green spots and stripes.\r\n\r\nA very common variety in the United States is the red-banded\r\nsalamander, distinguished not only for the red band down his back, but\r\nfor his activity in climbing. Shut him in a room and he darts up the\r\nwall lightly as a sailor goes up a mast. Put him in a glass case, he\r\nruns up the glass with the ease of a fly, and hangs from the plate at\r\nthe top back downward, moving his dumpy head from side to side. You\r\nalmost fancy a grin on his wide mouth, and a leer in his bright, black\r\neyes, as if he said, “How does this strike you?” The secret of these\r\nfeats is, that he can adhere to smooth surfaces by means of a moisture\r\ndiffused over the lower part of his body and the soles of his feet.\r\n\r\nThe red-banded salamander may sometimes be found in the woods lying\r\ncoiled on the tip of a branch or a large fern frond, the red line on\r\nhis back showing like a coil of scarlet ribbon. If he is alarmed this\r\ncoil snaps out straight, and by that motion he has cast himself several\r\nfeet distant, and is gone among the grass. Commend us to a red-banded\r\nsalamander or a wood-toad for a sudden and effective jump. Nothing is\r\nmore curious than to see this dainty little red-banded beast climbing\r\nup a rush, or a long, stiff spear of grass, or the graceful, plumed\r\nstalk of a golden-rod.\r\n\r\nThe very prettiest of all the salamanders is found in the red-wood\r\nforests of California; it is of a vivid salmon-color and has very\r\nprominent, bright eyes. Salamanders are found from Mexico to Siberia,\r\nand in general it may be stated that those of the warm latitudes are\r\nsmaller, more active, and more gaily colored; those of colder climates\r\nare larger, duller, dark colored, and very slow in motion. In the\r\nBritish Islands there are no salamanders.\r\n\r\nThe red-woods of California belong to a very ancient class of\r\ntree-vegetation: the salamanders are of an ancient class of living\r\nthings. I have sometimes wondered looking at one of those little,\r\nbrilliant, salmon-hued salamanders, with its staring bright eyes that\r\nsee everything, whether it has received by tradition from its elders,\r\ntales of a time when intrusive mammals with man at their head were\r\nunknown, and they and the red-woods had their world to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIV.\r\n\r\nA DENIZEN OF THE MARSH LANDS.\r\n\r\n    “But the cold-blooded snake in the edge of the brake\r\n    Sits amid the rank grass, half asleep, half awake;\r\n    And the ashen white snail, with the slime in its trail,\r\n    Moves wearily on, like a life’s tedious tale.”\r\n\r\n                                          --R. S. NICHOLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the question “What is a siren?” were suddenly put to a class of\r\npupils, I think it probable that the boys would reply, “a steam\r\nwhistle,” and the girls, “a fabulous monster with a beautiful voice,\r\nwhich she used to lure people to destruction.” Possibly some few\r\nobservant lads from Georgia, Texas, and South Carolina, might say: “An\r\nanimal something like a lizard; it lives in the marshes.” The girls\r\nwould be right, and the boys right, but this last would be the answer\r\nwished for in natural history. A siren is an amphibious animal closely\r\nallied to the salamanders.\r\n\r\nThere are four families of amphibians, or batrachians, which are so\r\nclosely connected that in some of their stages of development they can\r\nscarcely be told one from the other.\r\n\r\nIn these the young of some present almost exactly the adult conditions\r\nof the others, and the larvæ of the lower forms have been known to\r\nundergo transformations that have changed them from the likeness of\r\ntheir parents to the fashions of the allied species. Thus the adult\r\nsirens are scarcely distinguishable from the aquatic larvæ of the\r\nsalamanders. Siren larvæ have developed into the condition of adult\r\nsalamanders, while the young of the salamanders greatly resemble\r\ntadpoles, or larval toads and frogs.\r\n\r\nThe adult menobranch has a skull like that of a tadpole, or a\r\nsalamander in the larval state. In fact, wherever the young of one of\r\nthese families diverge from the form of their parents, it is simply to\r\ntrench upon the form of some of the allied species.\r\n\r\nWe have noted that frogs and toads have the tongue fastened at the\r\nfront of the mouth, and hanging free down the throat. Some of the\r\nsalamanders have the tongue fastened in the middle of the under side,\r\nso that it resembles a broad, flat mushroom on a short, thick stem,\r\nwhile the teeth are set in a fine brush above it on the roof of the\r\nmouth. In the sirens the tongue is free in front; there are no teeth\r\non the jaws, and the jaws are cased in a horny sheath like a beak; but\r\ndown the throat there are two patches of sharp little teeth pointed\r\nbackwards.\r\n\r\nLet us take a look at a siren. At first one might call it a fish or an\r\neel, wearing queer plumes at the back of the head, and also endowed\r\nwith little legs and feet. This is the “lizard-formed siren,” and the\r\nlargest specimen ever found was about three feet long: most of them\r\ndo not exceed twenty inches in length. The body is long and slim,\r\nlike that of an eel; the skin is smooth and nearly black, besprinkled\r\nwith little white dots. From the shoulders, near the head, come a\r\npair of small, feeble legs, the feet being divided into four fingers.\r\nThese feet aid the movements of the creature on the sand or mud when\r\nit emerges from the water, and serve to elevate the neck a little in\r\ncatching and swallowing prey.\r\n\r\nThe motion of the siren in the water is sinuous, like that of an eel;\r\nthe legs may help a little as paddles, but the action from side to\r\nside, such as we have all noticed in a water-snake, is that by which it\r\nprogresses. Well, let us look, for the hind-legs, now that we have seen\r\nthe front ones. Where are they? Gone altogether! Nature seems to have\r\nconcluded that a little beast which would let its front legs dwindle\r\naway from want of use, might as well be deprived of the hind ones\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nThe head of the siren is small; it seems to have as little use for\r\nbrains as for feet. The snout is short and broad, with the nostrils\r\nnear the tip; and as for eyes!--they are the tiniest little dots;\r\nevidently our siren does not depend much on taking observations of\r\nits surroundings. On the other hand the mouth of the creature is\r\ndisproportionately large, opening across the entire head. The beastie\r\nlives to eat, and his mouth is, it seems, his chief organ. This ugly\r\nhead sits close on an eel-like body which finishes up in a point at the\r\ntail, where there is a fin, as a fish has.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous feature of the siren is the appendage placed\r\nbranch-like on each side of the neck. These appendages have three\r\ndivisions, each one with a separate attachment, and under each one is a\r\nsmall slit or opening into the siren’s throat. What are these branches\r\nwaving like plumes? They are external gills, and very pretty they\r\nare, the only pretty things about a siren; these gills are of a pale\r\nrose-color shaded with gray, and waving and catching the light as the\r\ncreature swims, they redeem him from absolute ugliness.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered why this animal has been named a siren, after the\r\nbeautiful and fatal creature of fable. Beauty, song, malice; these were\r\nthe three characteristics of the sirens of which old Homer sung, and\r\nnot one of these endowments belongs to the siren of the marshes,--ugly,\r\nsilent, harmless. He is hungry, and he eats, and his food is toads,\r\nfrogs, insects, any animal organism he can find in the water. He merely\r\nopens his mouth and takes his prey in; he neither lulls it nor lures it\r\nwith music.\r\n\r\nA first cousin of this lizard-formed siren, is the striped siren of\r\nGeorgia. This has only one gill branch, and is distinguished by a\r\nbroad, yellow band on each side, and a narrower one on the under part\r\nof the body. “A mud-eel” it is popularly called. It is very scarce, and\r\nvaluable accordingly. Few of the museums or zoölogical gardens have\r\nspecimens of this siren. No doubt ignorant and careless people, finding\r\nthis odd and helpless creature in its native haunts, ruthlessly kill\r\nit, just because they can, and leave to decay specimens which, if taken\r\nliving, or carefully preserved in alcohol, would have been of great\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe siren sometimes suffers the loss of its pretty gills in a queer\r\nway. Fishes, attracted by their roseate color, nibble them off. In such\r\ncases the siren can breathe by coming to the surface of the water, and\r\ntaking in mouthfuls of air, which it suffers to escape through the\r\nslits at the neck. This method of breathing is evidently inconvenient\r\nand difficult to the creature, but allows it to maintain life until\r\nnew gill-branches grow, a process which requires some eight weeks to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nSome sirens wear a little gold-colored band about the lips and face,\r\nwhich band shines like molten metal in the water, and gives them a gay\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe sirens are quiet and hardy animals, and small ones could be easily\r\nkept for pets in a glass aquarium box, if provided with a little\r\nmud and sand under the water, and with some stones upon which the\r\ncreatures could crawl when they wished to be above water. Like all the\r\ncarnivorous amphibians the sirens will eat bread and milk and raw veal,\r\ninstead of their usual food.\r\n\r\nWhile chiefly confined to marshy places or still waters of the South,\r\noccasional specimens of the siren families have been found as far north\r\nas Illinois,[68] and no doubt could live in any locality in the United\r\nStates, if protected from their enemies. For their own part they are\r\nhelpless, and fall a prey to whatever attacks them. Their teeth are\r\nfar down in the throat so they cannot bite; their tails are weak so\r\nthey cannot strike; they have even no nails on their toes wherewith to\r\nscratch. Instead of nails they have a little horny cap on each of the\r\ntoes, rendering it broader, and so less likely to stick fast in the mud\r\nwhen they crawl out upon a bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] The menobranchus abounds in all the “five Great Lakes,” especially\r\nin Lake Michigan.--O.

As I did so I\r\nremarked “that there were three fish in the case swimming around some\r\nkind of a leafless plant, on which hung a few round, small pods.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEARL CRADLES.]\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the microscope I found my mind obstinately fixed on\r\nthe contents of the glass case. “That was surely not a stiff sea-plant,\r\nbut the dead branch of a land-plant.” “I wonder what fish those were?”\r\n“Those were very odd-looking little pods!” So I thought, until I\r\nconcluded to take a second look at the objects so obtrusively present\r\nto my mind. Lo! the branch had not merely a few little pods, but some\r\npods were on every one of the numerous tine divisions of the branch,\r\nexcept one long one near the bottom. These pods were pearly, flat,\r\nsemi-transparent, of the size of shirt buttons, and in the centre of\r\neach was a black dot answering to the button’s eye.\r\n\r\nAs I observed them, the three “fish” kept swimming round and round the\r\nbranch, in and out, and I noticed that this piece of dry plant was\r\nsecurely fastened to the bottom of the tank. But what! The lately bare\r\nlower twig had now four pellucid pods upon it! Surely the fish were\r\nplacing these upon the twigs! The pods were then egg-cases.\r\n\r\nSo, my good fish, I said, you are hanging your babies upon a tree-top,\r\nare you? That very bad mother, the dog-fish, does the same.[69] But her\r\ncradles are black and horny; yours are like pearls! Who are you? Whence\r\ndo you come? What is your place and name among all the fish families?\r\n\r\nStop: What is this I see growing from each side of your neck, like\r\nenormous whiskers? By this I perceive that you are not fish at all, but\r\nbatrachians. These plumes are your external gills. And what are these?\r\nWhy, truly, small legs and feet neatly drawn back as you swim; five\r\nwebbed toes on the hind feet; four webbed toes on the front feet. Ah,\r\nbut you are an interesting animal! Kindly stop swimming for a little\r\nuntil I count up your gifts and graces. A blunt head, shaped like the\r\nend of an ear of maize; a wide mouth; nostrils close to the lips; two\r\nlittle eyes also set close to the upper lip. Ah! I know you now--bone\r\nof contention among the scientific, most unexpected in your behavior,\r\nspecimen of the order Urodela, spotted Amblystoma, oh, why cannot you\r\nhave at least one simple and easy name, Mexican axolotl!\r\n\r\nA curious little child of Mexico is this denizen of the lakes of that\r\nwarm southern land--a mild, silent, unhandsome, small beast, given to\r\nsurprising people. The chief peculiarity of the creature is that it\r\nobstinately refuses ever to grow up, and remains in the larval state,\r\ninstead of properly putting on the form of an adult. Nature’s perpetual\r\nchild! And when it does grow up by chance, as, to be more surprising,\r\nsome individuals do grow up, why then, it is no longer itself--but\r\nsomething else!\r\n\r\nNow my interest was greatly quickened in this creature, and I began\r\nto admire it. Its scaleless skin was of a dark drab or steel color,\r\nof a velvet-like softness; the gills were three on each side of the\r\nhead, finely divided into soft, thick plumes, which waved to and fro,\r\nexpanded, closed, half-folded, spread wide. No Spanish belle ever\r\nhandled a fan more beautifully than this little swimmer used its\r\ngill-branches.\r\n\r\nObserve now the method of placing those translucent pearl cradles, the\r\negg-pods. Twice about the twig the axolotl swims, eying it closely, as\r\nif considering of its fitness. Then she takes the twig, or the long,\r\nlithe stem of water-weed between her little webbed hands to steady it,\r\nand glides softly up the stem, and as she goes attaches the little\r\npearl balls like seed-pods in a row. Nothing can be prettier than a\r\nlong withe of green weed set with these pearly cradles shimmering in\r\nthe sunlight; for not only do they hang as fair round pearls against\r\nthe green in the water, but they are powdered all over with gold dust.\r\nThis is a combination of green, pearl, and gold that any artist might\r\nenvy.\r\n\r\nThe egg itself is the dark dot in the centre of that gold-besprinkled\r\ncradle. At first the inclosing jelly is but a small rim, but it expands\r\nimmediately, remaining firmly attached to the stem. The little axolotl\r\ncomes out of the egg perfectly formed, a minute copy of its parent;\r\nfor we must remember that this parent is never grown-up, but remains\r\nalways in the incomplete or larval state of its existence. The newly\r\nhatched axolotls grow rapidly to six or eight inches in length, and\r\nexcept for the branching gills closely resemble their near cousins, the\r\nsalamanders.\r\n\r\nUntil 1865 the axolotls had never been closely studied. In Mexico they\r\nare abundant, are sold as an article of food in the markets and are\r\neaten, “no questions being asked.” They are to the Mexican buyers,\r\naxolotls, and that is enough. When taken to European museums the\r\naxolotls were supposed from their imperfect development to be larvæ,\r\nwhich one day would metamorphose into their adult form.\r\n\r\nFor several years the first specimens in Paris remained just as when\r\nthey had been brought from their native lakes. Then, a change being\r\nmade in their tank giving them more healthful conditions, what did they\r\ndo but select some spears of grass and weed and decorate them with\r\negg-cases! For thirty days the egg-cases adhered to the twigs, then the\r\nlittle ones hatched out, larvæ, like their parents.\r\n\r\nAfter this curious circumstance had been discussed for a time, some\r\nscientific people thought they would try and force these axolotls to\r\ngrow up. They were gradually removed from the water and accustomed more\r\nand more to breathe in the air. As this process continued, some of the\r\ncreatures died, some made no change in their state, but some began to\r\naccommodate themselves to air-breathing without the help of water;\r\nthe gills began to wither or waste away, as often happens to unused\r\nmembers of a living body; after a time these external gills dropped\r\noff entirely and the axolotl breathed through the slit at the bottom\r\nof the branchial stump. As soon as this was accomplished, behold, not\r\nan axolotl at all, but a salamander, for meantime the legs also had\r\ndeveloped and strengthened.\r\n\r\nA German lady secured in this way the change of young axolotls to\r\nsalamanders, or at least to salamandral form and habits. It has\r\ntherefore been held that axolotls may be a class of salamanders, which\r\nfrom the conditions of their life have never dropped their gills or\r\naccustomed themselves to a land life. Others think that as the young\r\nsalamanders and axolotls are so alike, mistakes have been made in\r\nhandling the larvæ, and that those which developed as salamanders\r\nwere hatched salamanders. So little is really known of the habits\r\nand life history of these creatures that they offer a pretty clear\r\nfield for observation and experiment. It would be easy for some of\r\nour scientifically inclined young Americans to secure specimens from\r\nMexico, and rearing the young from the eggs, note all their changes.\r\nNothing is more attractive than original investigation.\r\n\r\nSome call the axolotl the “fish-formed siren,” as it has a fin-like\r\nmembrane down the middle of the back, around the tail, and so on along\r\npart of the under portion of the body. This fin enables it to balance\r\nitself admirably in the water. Axolotls eat worms, snails, tadpoles,\r\ninsects, bread-crumbs, bits of meat, or any small larvæ found in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[69] Nature Reader, No. 3, Lesson 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVI.\r\n\r\nSOME MERRY LITTLE FRIENDS.\r\n\r\n    “The heedless lizard in his gambols, peeped\r\n    Upon the guarded nest, from out the flowers,\r\n      But paid the instant forfeit of his life.”\r\n\r\n                                   --MONTGOMERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn calling the hideous and ill-tempered alligator _el lagarto_, the\r\nlizard, I think the Spanish explorers were guilty of a crying injustice\r\nto the lizard family, many of the members of which are the most\r\ndelightful little creatures imaginable.\r\n\r\nHow often in Italy, seated by some ancient ruin or on a stone wall\r\ndraped in rose vines, I have watched the merry little lizards, dressed\r\nin crimson, orange, or green, darting among the gray stones like\r\nflashes of living light, or running along the trailing vines like\r\nanimated blossoms.\r\n\r\nHow often in the warm fragrant silence of the Tuscan hills, have I\r\nseen, thrust from the chinks of a pile of crumbling masonry, a pert\r\nlittle head, with a pair of diamond-bright eyes, watching me with\r\nintent interest. Friendly, graceful, entirely harmless, these little\r\nlizards seem to suit the beauty-loving Italians. I have never seen the\r\nsmallest or rudest Italian boy throw a stone at one of them, or try in\r\nany way to hurt them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KNIGHTS ERRANT.]\r\n\r\nThe lizards in our own country are no less friendly and beautiful,\r\nbut it seems to me our people are less in harmony with nature than\r\nsome others, and cherish more unjust traditions; for certainly among\r\nus the lizards are received in less hearty good-fellowship, and are\r\nvery wrongly feared and esteemed harmful. But some people know how to\r\ntreat my dear lizards with courtesy. A young friend in Florida has made\r\npets of sundry emerald-green lizards. No creatures are more capable\r\nof maintaining an absolute stillness if they are suited with their\r\ncircumstances. Like most of the cold-blooded reptiles, they delight\r\nin warmth. My young friend often placed a little green lizard in the\r\nknot of lace at the throat of her evening dress, where, delighted with\r\nthe softness and warmth of the lace and its owner’s neck, it would lie\r\nmotionless for an entire evening. It was often mistaken for a piece\r\nof jeweller’s work in rich green enamel, upon the beauty of which her\r\nfriends sometimes commented. One of these little lizards would remain\r\nfor hours, twined bracelet-wise about my young friend’s wrist.\r\n\r\nInoffensive in disposition and unprovided with weapons of attack as\r\nlizards are, I have often admired nature’s protective methods in\r\ntheir behalf. Walking once in a wood in New Jersey, I was surprised\r\nto observe a fragment of the bark of a tree some two feet from me,\r\nrun round the tree and appear on the farther side. Here was a little\r\nlizard of the exact color and markings of the bark of the tree which\r\nit frequented; it was only by its motion that it could be discovered\r\nwhen it clung against the trunk or branches. When at rest its little,\r\nbright, jet-black eyes were the only noticeable part of it. In that\r\nsame wood I was equally startled by seeing a dead leaf run away from\r\na heap of leaves as I approached, and a little twig in my path darted\r\nout of danger just as I was about to put my foot upon it. These also\r\nwere lizards, with their slender bodies dressed in gray and brown,\r\nwith little markings of black and white, a coat closely simulating the\r\ncolors of dry and decaying vegetation.\r\n\r\nWhile capable of lying for hours in entire quiet, still as if fashioned\r\nout of gems or metal, the lizard, when it moves, is remarkable for the\r\nswiftness of its motions: it darts with the rapidity of an arrow;\r\nit seems to have no hesitancy, no afterthought, no change of mind;\r\nits spring is with the precision of entire certainty. Perhaps its\r\nsure-footedness has something to do with this; on wall or wood, tree,\r\nstone, grass, who ever saw a lizard slip or lose its footing?\r\n\r\nIn the lizard family there is a large variety in habits and appearance.\r\nWe say that they are quick of motion--but then, what is more dull\r\nand sluggish than a hatteria? We assert that they are pretty and\r\nattractive, but what is more undeniably ugly in appearance than the\r\nhorned toad of Texas, which is really a lizard? While in general the\r\nbody of a lizard is slender and long, supported by four legs, in some\r\nspecies the legs are mere rudiments, and in others gone altogether.\r\nWhen present the feet and legs are sometimes weak, so that the body\r\ndrags upon the ground.\r\n\r\nThe chameleons have their feet designed for grasping and climbing: the\r\ngeckos of Asia have their feet changed into sucking disks, by which\r\nthey can run up smooth walls; other lizards, which are chiefly aquatic,\r\nhave feet formed for swimming; others still live in the ground and have\r\nhands fashioned like those of a mole, for digging.\r\n\r\nAs for homes, some lizards are tree-dwellers; others live on the\r\nground, hiding in stone or rubbish heaps; some live in the ground in\r\nburrows; others abide by rivers, and spend most of their time in the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe lizards are citizens of the world, and are found in nearly all\r\nlands, but are most numerous and most brilliantly colored in hot\r\ncountries. Wherever they are, some have so evidently the lizard\r\ncharacteristics that one who has ever seen any of the family would\r\nnot fail to recognize their relationships at once; but others, as for\r\nexample, the horned toad of Texas, might be thought at first sight to\r\nbelong to some quite different order of animals.\r\n\r\nSome lizards have scales; others have no scales, but thick, granulated\r\nskins: some have no eyelids; others have eyelids, but their eyelids\r\ndiffer, some are nearly transparent, admitting light when they\r\nare closed; while yet other lizards, as the chameleons, have lids\r\nsurrounding the entire eye, so that they can be drawn together and\r\nadmit light at merely a tiny opening.\r\n\r\nIn cold and temperate lands lizards lie dormant during the winter\r\nmonths; this is called hibernating. At the return of spring they come\r\nforth from their hiding-places. In tropical countries, while there is\r\nno cold to drive the lizards to a state of torpor, they still sink into\r\na long sleep, or half-conscious condition, which lasts for some weeks.\r\n\r\nNearly all lizards lay eggs, which are warmed into life by the sun,\r\nand the young ones are able to take care of themselves as soon as\r\nhatched. But even in this part of its life-history the lizard shows the\r\nchangefulness of its race,--as variable in all things as a chameleon’s\r\ncoat. Some lizards have living young, which they nurse with assiduous\r\ncare.\r\n\r\nA description of curious lizards would fill a volume; we can note\r\nonly a few of the less well-known varieties. The geckos are a very\r\ninteresting family, living chiefly in Asia. The “croaking gecko” is a\r\nlizard which distinguishes himself by breaking the spell of silence\r\nwhich lies upon his order, and making a loud noise almost as unpleasant\r\nas that raised by a frog. The “flying gecko,” like the flying\r\nsquirrel, has a wing-like expansion of the skin, and widely webbed\r\nfeet, which enable it to support itself in the air as it leaps from\r\ntree to tree.\r\n\r\nAnother Oriental lizard is named “the frilled,” because he wears a\r\nlarge quilled collar, or ruff, all around his neck; upon his head is a\r\ncrest deeply indented, and down his back from head to tail-tip a full\r\nruffle like a cloak close folded, or a court train. In fact, whenever\r\nI have seen a frilled lizard I have had a laugh, not only at its truly\r\npert and comic appearance, but because he seems such a jolly little\r\ncaricature of stately Queen Bess in her head tire, ruff, farthingale,\r\nand court train. Then, too, other ideas come to heighten my mirth over\r\na frilled lizard.\r\n\r\nYou must know that lizards’ tails are very brittle and not infrequently\r\nbreak off; when this happens the organ grows again just as a crab’s\r\nclaw does. I wonder if the tail of the frilled lizard is apt to break\r\noff, and how long it takes such a cumbersome appendage to grow. Then,\r\nagain, here is my other little joke over him: all lizards, as they grow\r\ncast their skins; toads and frogs do this also, and crabs cast their\r\nshells. The process is far from unusual, but the lizards like the toads\r\nswallow their worn-out garments, and how can my frilled lizard swallow\r\nsuch an amount of frilling and furbelow and flouncing! I should say he\r\nmust choke! It would be as bad as being obliged to eat a birthday cake,\r\ncandles, wreaths of flowers, and all. But when I stand before a frilled\r\nlizard, and laugh at all these queer notions concerning him, what does\r\nhe do but bob and move his head and neck, until all his ruffles quiver\r\nand curl in a most threatening way, as if he meant to alarm me by his\r\nferocious appearance. But he is really a timid creature, and would\r\nrather fly than fight. If you persecute him and drive him into a corner\r\nhe will now and then turn at bay, and bite with some sharp little teeth\r\nthat he has.\r\n\r\nThe “flying dragon” is another odd lizard, provided with an extended\r\nmembrane to serve as a parachute, and by which he flies--a little. But\r\nwhy call the dear little beast a dragon? His colors are wonderfully\r\nbeautiful, as if he had been dipped in a melted rainbow, or in the\r\nstuff that peacock’s plumes are made of. We think that dragons are\r\nfierce creatures, but this “flying-dragon” lizard lives in trees and\r\ndaintily feeds upon gay-colored insects, as pretty as itself.\r\n\r\nAnother lizard is called the “horrid Moloch” from an ancient idol-god.\r\nThis, with perhaps the exception of the “horned toad,” is one of\r\nthe most hideous creatures known. It is covered with large conical\r\nprojections over the entire body; its feet are clawed, and the\r\nprojections develop into horns on the top of the head and neck. These\r\nprojections are merely a thick growth of the skin, each tipped with\r\nhorny plates, and entirely intended for defensive armor, but they give\r\nthe creature a formidable appearance.\r\n\r\nStill another variety of the lizard tribe is the pygopus of Australia,\r\na lizard with only one pair of legs, and these are scaly and footless.\r\nIndeed they look merely like fleshy fins, and as the animal is very\r\nlong and slim, and is covered with scales, at first sight it is almost\r\nimpossible to consider it a lizard at all; it looks more like a snake.\r\n\r\nThe iguana is a lizard of tropical countries: it is large, harmless,\r\nperhaps we had better say it is useful; for the natives of the\r\ncountries where it lives are fond of its flesh for food, and think as\r\nwell of a fried or roasted iguana as we do of roast chicken.\r\n\r\nPerhaps of the entire lizard family the most famous is the basilisk,\r\nabout which much has been said and sung. The ancients had as many odd\r\nmyths about the basilisk, as they had about the salamander. They said\r\nit was the king of all reptiles and wore a crown of gold: from its body\r\ndiffused a poison which filled the air and killed not only animals\r\nbut plants: the glance of its eye was so terrible that all living\r\nthings fled from it--unless they fell dead on the spot, infected by\r\nits poison. The basilisk was afraid of only one living creature, and\r\nthat creature was--a cock. The crowing of a cock filled the king of all\r\nreptiles with an awful terror.\r\n\r\nBut what is the truth about the basilisk? The creature has been\r\ninvestigated by modern science. What does science report of it? Science\r\nsays the basilisk is one of the prettiest and gentlest little creatures\r\nknown. It is crested, and that crest is the famous “golden crown” of\r\nthe ancient story; it is clawed, because it is a tree-climber; its eyes\r\nare large, gentle, lustrous; its skin is striped; its toes are much\r\nlike the toes of a bird; its food is insects; it has no poison, and as\r\nfor a cock’s crow--it pays no heed to it whatever.\r\n\r\nThe Hilas are another family of lizards, embracing one with an ominous\r\ntitle, “The Gila monster.” This is not inaptly named, for it is uncouth\r\nin appearance, large, and, unlike most lizards, has a poisonous bite.\r\nThough this bite is painful, it is not fatal.\r\n\r\nThe skinks are earth-burrowing lizards, not prettily shaped but\r\nhandsomely colored, and especially noted for wearing vivid shades of\r\nblue, a tint unusual in reptiles. The ancients had myths about the\r\nskink as well as about the poor basilisk. They said it poisoned cattle,\r\nand was ever on the alert to do harm to man or beast. The fact is the\r\nskink is alert only for slugs, insects, and worms which it eats. Nearly\r\nall lizards are insect-eaters, though in captivity they will eat cake\r\nand bread.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT MONSTER.\r\n\r\n    “The various terrors of that horrid shore,--\r\n    Those blazing suns that dart a downward ray,\r\n    And fiercely shed intolerable day;\r\n    Those matted woods, where birds forget to sing,\r\n    And silent bats in drowsy clusters cling;\r\n    Those poisonous fields, rich with luxuriance crowned\r\n    Where the dark scorpion gathers death around.”\r\n\r\n                                            --GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word reptile seems to be in such bad repute, and to raise such\r\ndisagreeable associations in the minds of many people, that in\r\nintroducing a few specimens of the class reptilia we began, not by\r\ndescribing the characteristics of the class, but by introducing some of\r\nits most pleasing members--the lizards. Let us now turn for a little to\r\nthe distinguishing features of the class, and then to the animal which\r\nis its leading representative.\r\n\r\nThe class reptilia stands next to the class batrachia. Reptiles are\r\ncold-blooded, vertebrate animals, which breathe by the means of lungs.\r\nThe form of the body is generally like that of the batrachians, between\r\nwhich and the birds, the reptiles find their place in nature. Thus the\r\nhorned toad and the “horrid Moloch” are lizards,--reptiles which look\r\nvery much more like toads than like their reptile brethren,--while the\r\n“frilled lizard” and the “flying dragon,” gayly colored tree-dwellers,\r\nare more suggestive of birds than of some other lizards.\r\n\r\nThe body of most reptiles performs the chief part in locomotion, moving\r\nwith an undulatory action from side to side. The spinal column is\r\ntherefore strong and stiff, and the tail is long, while the head and\r\nshoulders are comparatively small and narrow. Some of the reptiles,\r\nas the serpent tribe, have no feet, but the tortoise family have\r\nwell-developed feet, and move by means of them, and not by serpentine\r\nundulations of the body. Most of the reptiles are voracious feeders,\r\nand are well provided with teeth. The skull is always depressed, with a\r\nsmall cavity for the brain, and the standard of reptilian intelligence\r\nis comparatively low.\r\n\r\nNo class varies more greatly in the size of its representatives. We\r\nfind tiny chameleons and lizards but a very few inches long, and great\r\ncrocodiles many feet in length. There are snakes no longer than one’s\r\nlittle finger, and boa-constrictors large enough to swallow a man or a\r\ncow. There are little turtles of the diameter of a twenty-five-cent\r\npiece, and huge turtles that weigh eight hundred pounds. When we name\r\nthese species we are reminded what a wide variety there is in the\r\nfamilies of the reptilian class.\r\n\r\nThere are four methods of securing safety, or life-preservation, known\r\namong the reptiles; the most common,--because the small creatures to\r\nwhich it pertains are happily the most numerous of their group--is\r\nimitation in form and color. We have noted this in the lizards. The\r\nsecond method is the wearing of natural armor, by the thickening of\r\nthe skin or hide. Thus, in the serpents, the skin is often covered\r\nwith scales; the scale-plate of crocodiles and alligators is generally\r\nbullet-proof; in the turtle family the body is protected by a hard,\r\nsolid box of united plates neatly and closely put together. A third\r\nmeans of preservation is found in weapons of defence, as great teeth\r\nand huge, lashing tails, as in the crocodilia; or violent poison in\r\nfangs, as in many snakes. Lastly, the greater reptiles have often\r\nno weapon but their vast strength, as most of the boas; no creature\r\ndesires to cope with them or go within reach of their mighty coils.\r\n\r\nTo make closer acquaintance with the most prominent and notable of all\r\nreptiles, we must go to the torrid zone. The hot breath of the desert\r\nsmites us, as the sun’s rays are like fierce thrusts, the noon-day is\r\nscorching, still, breathless; the green of summer seems to have been\r\nburned away, as in a furnace blast. There, stretched his lazy length on\r\nthe black ooze, beside the famous river of Africa, lying in the full\r\nglare of the sun, his little eyes sleepily shut, heedless alike of\r\nthe insects that cluster about him, and of the birds which dart down\r\nto carry them off, lies the monster that was in ancient times often\r\nworshipped as a god--the crocodile.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile gives his name to his order, crocodilia; which order,\r\nhappily for human convenience, has but few representatives. The\r\ncharacteristics of this order are: aquatic habits, firmly planted\r\nteeth, skin thick and furnished with armor-plates, a long tail, four\r\nshort legs, and feet with toes. The crocodile’s limbs are muscular and\r\nactive, well articulated or put together, and end in fingers or toes,\r\nwhichever we may choose to call them. The strong, bony plates are\r\nchiefly on the creature’s back. A peculiarity of the teeth is that they\r\nare cone or wedge shaped, and a pair on the lower jaw are much longer\r\nthan the others, and fit into notches in the upper jaw when the mouth\r\nis closed. What is the use of these big teeth? It is to seize and hold\r\nfirmly the prey of the monster, so that by no struggles can it escape\r\nwhen held by these cruel prongs.\r\n\r\nThe crocodilia are all inhabitants of hot countries, and are found in\r\nAsia, Africa, Australia, and tropical America. We chiefly associate\r\nthem in our thoughts with the Nile and the Ganges rivers, where they\r\nparticularly abound, and were once paid divine honors.\r\n\r\nThe gavial, or crocodile of India, often reaches twenty-five feet in\r\nlength, and is the giant of its order.[70] It is distinguished from the\r\ntrue Nile crocodiles and the alligators by its very long and narrow\r\nsnout, the jaws of which are set with fifty-four teeth above and\r\nfifty-two below, presenting the appearance of a terrible pair of huge\r\ndouble saws. Each of these great cone-shaped teeth has beneath it,\r\nslowly growing for future use, two or three other teeth, which, as the\r\ntooth in use is worn out, grow up and displace it, and so continue the\r\nperfection of the entire set.\r\n\r\nThe shape of the nose or snout of the crocodile changes with its age;\r\na young crocodile’s snout is depressed, and the animal cannot remain\r\nunder water so long as an old one. The male gavials have a large,\r\nprominent swelling in front of the nostril.\r\n\r\nAfrica is the original home of the true crocodile, and there it has\r\nbeen feared and deified from remote antiquity. Pictures and sculptures\r\nof it are to be found on the oldest monuments. With the terror of the\r\ncrocodile the African mothers frighten their children into obedience,\r\nand often in the end the crocodile gets both mother and child if they\r\nventure too near the water. In the Upper Nile region the beasts abound,\r\nand are seen lying basking in the sun, “placed side by side like rows\r\nof felled tree trunks,” says one traveller. They abound thus because\r\nthe number of eggs deposited is enormous. No creature is more subject\r\nto enemies: men, turtles, and fish, besides wild animals, seek out and\r\ndevour the crocodile eggs. As soon as the little monsters are hatched,\r\nfish, wild beasts, birds of prey, and the large male crocodiles wait to\r\ndevour them. A baby crocodile has no friend or defender but its mother,\r\nand through all its life it is the foe of nearly every living thing,\r\nand consequently hated and attacked by everything that is capable of\r\ndoing it injury.\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles are entirely carnivorous in their habits. They prefer\r\nputrid flesh to fresh, and thus they are valuable river scavengers,\r\neating every carcass that appears. Travellers tell us that in attacking\r\nprey the crocodile prefers to give first a good blow with his tail,\r\nand so render the victim unconscious. Then he drags it under water and\r\ndevours it; or, if not pressingly hungry, buries it in the mud until it\r\npartly decays. The monsters lie in wait at fords, or at the drinking\r\nplaces where cattle and wild beasts come at evening to drink. Then they\r\nseize the stooping prey and pull it under the water. Antelopes, cows,\r\nand human beings seem to be the crocodile’s favorite food. The creature\r\nis cowardly and will draw off if a person shows fight when it appears.\r\n\r\nOwing to its habit of eating putrid flesh, the eyes, mouth, and throat\r\nof the crocodile are infested with swarms of large meat flies. The\r\n“Nile bird,” an agile and pretty insectivorous bird, follows the\r\ncrocodile about, and, dashing even into his open jaws, picks off the\r\nflies. The brute seems to understand the good offices of the bird, and\r\nnever snaps at it or closes his mouth upon it. Thus the Nile bird is\r\nthe only friend of the crocodile, and the only living thing that does\r\nnot fear him. The tongue of the crocodile is attached all round to the\r\nbottom of the mouth, and cannot be protruded. The neck is so formed\r\nwith rib-like processes that it can be moved but little, so the giant\r\nreptile has no means of ridding itself of its persistent insignificant\r\ntorments, the flies, and is at the mercy of the Nile bird’s appetite to\r\nget relief.\r\n\r\nThe mother crocodile lays her eggs in the sand, which she heaps over\r\nthem, and leaves the sun to warm them into life. A recent traveller\r\nsays that he took seventy-nine eggs from a crocodile’s place of deposit\r\nnear the bank of an African river. There was no effort to make a nest,\r\nbut the mother had chosen a spot a few paces from the bank of the\r\nriver, and had made it clear of plants in a circle of several yards in\r\ndiameter. To do this she had placed herself on the spot and wheeled her\r\nheavy body round a number of times, making the earth clear. Then she\r\nhad laid down a few branches, as if to prevent the eggs from rolling\r\naway. Next she dug out four pits, each about two feet deep, obliquely\r\nset. The eggs were laid twenty or twenty-five each day, until a hundred\r\nhad been placed in the pits, one pit being dug and filled before\r\nanother was made.\r\n\r\nAfter the eggs are laid the mother crocodile remains asleep near them\r\na great part of the time, basking in the sun, and leaving the place of\r\ndeposit only to go to the water and seek food. The egg-laying occurs\r\nbut once a year, about the opening of January. It is two months before\r\nthe young hatch out, and about the time they appear the rainy season\r\nsets in. As they come from the hatching place they take to the water\r\nby instinct, and there the mother is waiting to give them what defence\r\nshe can, for the male adult crocodiles are ready to devour them, and\r\nwild beasts of various kinds make them a prey. The young crocodiles\r\nshow their fierce disposition at once, fighting, biting, and making\r\nthemselves generally disagreeable as soon as they get into the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[70] Specimens even longer than this have been noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nEL LAGARTO.\r\n\r\n    Basking upon a log he lies;\r\n    Around him skim the dragon flies;\r\n    Above the squirrel drums his tune;\r\n    The rabbit steals along the brake,\r\n    And trembles lest his footsteps wake\r\n    The tyrant of the still lagoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LURKING.]\r\n\r\nThe alligator is an American crocodile.[71] The order crocodilia, which\r\nincludes the gavial of India, the true crocodile of the Nile, the\r\ncayman of the Orinoco region, and the American alligator, is plentiful\r\nin Florida and some of our other Southern States, and takes its\r\nscientific name from the Mississippi River,[72] one of its favorite\r\nhomes. The name alligator is of Spanish origin, _el lagarto_, the\r\nlizard, and was given by the early Spanish explorers of our Southern\r\nStates because this was the greatest lizard they had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThis American crocodile, the alligator, is one of the best-known\r\ncreatures in the world. Being easily caught, and easily reared, it is\r\nseen in the cheapest shows, museums, and menageries, and in many public\r\naquariums and zoological gardens.\r\n\r\nFor my own part I never felt a deeper sympathy with any wretched beast\r\nthan I did with a pair of alligators in the Brighton Aquarium, England.\r\nLying in a grotto, where all that could be done in the way of providing\r\nthem with a few inches of water, and a certain amount of damp heat had\r\nbeen done to testify to the general good will of their keepers, were\r\nthose miserable exiles from their hot, native lagoons. I fancied that\r\namong the mists and raw cold of “John Bull’s tight little island” these\r\ncreatures longed, as I did, for the vivid blaze of a southern sun.\r\n\r\nWhile an alligator basking on a log in hot sunshine, deep water\r\nclose at hand to slip into for safety, is a picture of intense lazy\r\nenjoyment, an alligator blinking at an electric light in an aquarium,\r\na chilly beast stretched upon wet stones, seems in his stillness a\r\npicture of apathetic misery. I doubt if either of the beasts in the\r\naquarium could have roused to enough interest in life to snap at its\r\nfavorite food, a puppy, had one ventured near. They did not even show\r\nappreciation of the fact that a person like myself, with a toleration\r\nfor dog-days, and a hearty longing for palmettoes, trumpet-creepers,\r\nmagnolias, and red-birds, was looking at them with sympathy and a gleam\r\nof kindness!\r\n\r\nThe adult alligator is easily taken prisoner by being seized from\r\nbehind as it lies basking; its legs are securely bound, its mouth\r\nmuzzled, and then--away to a showman’s cage! The Orinoco cayman and\r\nthe Mississippi alligator are often captured in the following curious\r\nfashion. A hook baited with some small animal, which the alligator\r\nespecially likes as food, is dropped into the water, and when seized by\r\nthe alligator, the hook which is not sharp, but blunt and double, is\r\narranged to expand and fill the creature’s throat, but will not pierce\r\nor tear it. Then by pulling at the chain or rope attached to this hook,\r\nthe brute is drawn ashore. A strong man next leaps on its back, grasps\r\nits fore-legs and draws them bridle-wise back to serve as reins. Thus\r\nmounted the captor maintains his seat as on a fractious horse, during\r\nall the creature’s plunges and tail-lashing, until finally it succumbs,\r\nfairly worn out by its own battle. Once entirely exhausted, it becomes\r\nweak, mild, and obedient.\r\n\r\nThe food of the alligator is squirrels, rabbits, water-rats,\r\nwater-fowl, fish, hares, and young dogs, but it will attack men and\r\nkill children if it has opportunity. Its method of preying is much like\r\nthat of the Nile crocodile; the victim is first pulled under the water\r\nand drowned, and then eaten at leisure.[73] The alligator seems to know\r\nthat while he is merely enjoying a little agreeable change under the\r\nsurface of the water, his prey will drown.\r\n\r\nWhy does not the water rush into the lungs of the alligator, and so\r\nsmother it, as the alligator is a lung-breathing animal? Because it\r\nhas at the base of its tongue an interior collar which expands and\r\nguards the passages to the lungs when it is under water. When it wants\r\na mouthful of air it elevates its head above water while its hands hold\r\nits victim below the surface.\r\n\r\nThe alligator is a smaller animal than the crocodile, its length being\r\nfrom five to ten feet; its head is shorter and broader than that of the\r\ncrocodile, and its snout is more obtuse. The large, long teeth on the\r\nlower jaw do not, as in the crocodile, fit into external furrows on the\r\nupper jaw, but into pits made there to receive them. The hind legs and\r\nfeet of a crocodile have a jagged fringe which the alligator does not\r\nhave; the alligator’s hind feet are webbed only about half way up the\r\ntoes, and the crocodile’s hind feet are webbed to the very tip.\r\n\r\nDespite the strong musky odor of the alligator’s flesh, it has\r\nsometimes been eaten: so also there are people who will eat crocodile’s\r\nflesh and eggs. To a civilized appetite no flesh could be more\r\nloathsome.\r\n\r\nThe alligator’s bill of fare is not confined to the living creatures\r\nwe have just mentioned as furnishing its favorite food. Alert for its\r\nbreakfast, this pirate of the lagoons and bayous gathers up fish,\r\nflesh, and fowl for its table, but swallows, as a condiment, whatever\r\ncomes handy. An old rubber shoe floating in the water, an empty\r\nsoda-water bottle, a lost jack-knife, a battered tin can, a stone as\r\nbig as an orange, part of a broken lamp,--any of these are welcomed\r\nas serving to fill the yawning vacancy in its stomach, and to aid in\r\ngrinding up more digestible food. Similarly an ostrich will swallow\r\na horseshoe, a table-knife, a spoon, a leather strap and buckle, a\r\nfew spools of thread, or any other trifle left in its way, seeming\r\nto consider its stomach, as a school-boy does his pocket, a general\r\nreceptacle for almost anything that comes to hand!\r\n\r\nBaby alligators make rather amusing pets for a number of months, before\r\nthey begin to exhibit hereditary traits, when they at once fail to be\r\nagreeable. They will eat eggs, raw or cooked meat, rats, mice, birds,\r\nfrogs, toads. They learn to come when they are called, enjoy hearing a\r\nwhistle, and, on rare occasions, show some slight degree of gratitude\r\nand affection, amiable characteristics which they speedily outgrow.\r\nWhen these baby alligators are a few months old, they must be killed or\r\nput back into the water where their relatives live.\r\n\r\nAlligators are usually silent animals, but in the spring, when the eggs\r\nare being laid, they all become noisy and excited, and bellow like\r\nbuffaloes. A number of adult alligators roaring together make a sound\r\nlike distant heavy thunder.\r\n\r\nThe mother alligator builds with her front feet a mound of mud, or\r\nsand, though if she finds a mound just to her taste, she takes that,\r\nand saves herself trouble. In the mound she places her eggs, and in due\r\ntime the sun hatches them. The eggs of reptiles are not enclosed in\r\nhard, brittle shells, as those of birds, but in a thick, tough, elastic\r\nskin, as if the white skin that lines a bird’s egg-shell had grown\r\nparchment-like and served instead of shell. The eggs are the size of\r\nhen’s eggs, but more pointed.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the little alligators come from the egg, they scuttle off\r\nto the water and are ready to fight their enemies and begin their\r\npredatory lives. As they are smaller and less fierce than the gavials,\r\ncaymans, or true crocodiles, they are far less destructive. An\r\nalligator of twelve feet long is a giant of his kind. Not only are the\r\nalligators smaller than crocodiles, but they have fewer teeth, and are\r\n“less handy with their tails,” not being able to strike out quite so\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\nThe alligator is among the animals that are disappearing before\r\nperpetual hunting and the presence of men about their old haunts. They\r\nare still numerous, but fewer than they were some years ago. They will\r\ndie out speedily unless people undertake to raise them on alligator\r\nfarms. And why should people do that? For the sake of their skins.\r\nAlligator skins make a strong and handsome leather, very beautiful for\r\nbags, portmanteaus, purses, boots, portfolios; and for the sake of\r\ntheir skins they should be reared.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[71] A true _Crocodilus Americanus_, long overlooked or mistaken for an\r\nalligator, has been discovered in America.\r\n\r\n[72] _Alligator Mississippiensis._\r\n\r\n[73] The alligator, like the crocodile, can close the nostril opening\r\nand remain under water for some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIX.\r\n\r\nWISER THAN ANY BEAST OF THE FIELD.\r\n\r\n    “Beyond the shadows of the ship\r\n      I watched the water snakes;\r\n    They moved in tracks of shining white;\r\n    And when they reared, the elfish light\r\n      Fell off in hoary flakes.”\r\n\r\n           --COLERIDGE, _Ancient Mariner_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween man and the snake there seems to be placed an instinctive\r\nand unappeasable enmity. The snake, seeing any human being, either\r\nglides off in haste, or coils itself up and hisses, or throws itself\r\nforward in attack. The human being, on the other hand, experiences\r\nfear, disgust, aversion, and seizes stick or stone, or makes use of his\r\nheel, if well protected, to kill the snake. “War to the death, and no\r\nquarter,” seems to be the cry between the highest of the mammals and\r\nthe serpent tribe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUR NATURAL ENEMY.]\r\n\r\n“As hideous as a snake” is a common phrase, born of the hatred between\r\nman and the ophidian order, but in point of fact, were enmity left\r\nout of the question, the creatures of the serpent tribe are not\r\nhideous. A lithe, long, cylindrical body, coated with glittering\r\nscales, and splendid with all the colors of the rainbow, elegantly\r\narranged in rings, lines, or dots; bright eyes; graceful motions; a\r\ntongue that plays to and fro like lightning in an open throat, often\r\nof vivid flame color; a head sometimes crested as if bearing a royal\r\ncrown,--these are some of the characteristics of that serpent family,\r\nwhich instinctively we call “hideous” and “hateful.”\r\n\r\nTo the above briefly noted particulars we may add that the eyes of\r\nsnakes are lidless and the sight somewhat feeble; the sense of smell\r\nis better developed, and the nostrils are placed close to the mouth.\r\nThe mouth is large proportionately, and opens widely; the tongue is\r\nthe organ of touch; there are no external ears, and snakes seem to be\r\ndeficient in hearing. Snakes have no external limbs, except in two or\r\nthree species, where there are mere rudiments of hind-legs visible.\r\nThe snake’s body is elastic and capable of enormous distention. It is\r\nfurnished with a spinal column, and with numerous ribs. The ribs and\r\nscutes, or large scales, are the chief organs of locomotion.\r\n\r\nThe method of crawling shown by the worm, as described in Nature\r\nReader, No. 2, is very much like that of some snakes. There are three\r\nways in which snakes make their progression. First, they may glide\r\nforward with a perfectly straight motion, by pushing with the scutes,\r\nor large scale-like plates of the under part of the body, to which the\r\nends of the ribs are attached. Second, these scutes may open out as\r\nthe scales of a fish when scraped backward from head to tail,[74] and\r\non the edges of these opened scute-plates, the snake may walk. Third,\r\nthey may go forward by pushing; stretching out the body, and then\r\ncontracting it, and making the same motion over again, these motions\r\nbeing sinuous, or wave-like, from side to side.\r\n\r\nThe light, smooth body of the snake, provided with numerous small,\r\npowerful muscles, renders its progress by any of these methods\r\nexceedingly rapid. Water snakes swim, waving the body from side to\r\nside, and using the tail as an oar is used in sculling. No serpent can\r\nmove on a perfectly smooth surface, as glass; it must have some ridges,\r\nor roughness to resist the motions of the scales and ribs.\r\n\r\nSerpents are dumb except for their hiss, which is produced by driving\r\nthe air swiftly from the lungs. In some snakes the hiss is varied to a\r\nwhine or hum.\r\n\r\nSerpents, like the batrachians, cast off their skins and come out in\r\ngleaming new skins which have grown under the old ones. If the serpent\r\nfor any reason cannot cast its skin at the proper time, it sickens and\r\ndies. The cast coat is perfect in form, but is generally turned inside\r\nout. Cast snake-skins are sometimes found in the woods by sharp-eyed\r\nboys. Sometimes the lucky boy finds a whole skin; at other times the\r\ncast skin has been partly destroyed by ants, beetles, or the effects of\r\nthe weather. Some snakes swallow their cast-off skins.\r\n\r\nSnakes usually move about and hunt in the day-time, and sleep at night.\r\nThey hibernate, or take a long winter sleep, as the lizards do. For\r\nhibernation they retire to caves, to holes in logs or in the ground,\r\nand may be found torpid, a number rolled closely together. At such\r\ntimes the most poisonous snakes, as the viper and rattlesnake, may be\r\nhandled without danger. In the spring they begin to revive with the\r\nfirst warm weather.\r\n\r\nI remember that when I was a little girl a very beautiful hollow or\r\ncave in the river-bank not far from Niagara Falls was called “The\r\nRattlesnake’s Cove,” because so many snakes lived there. In summer the\r\nplace was carefully avoided. In early spring, before the snakes awoke\r\nfrom their sleep, this cove was a favorite place for picnics, and the\r\nschool-boys often went there armed with knives, hatchets, picks, and\r\nhoes, and hunted for the torpid snakes and killed them by scores.\r\n\r\nIn hot countries, where there is no winter to send them off to sleep,\r\nthe snakes are for some part of the year stupid and drowsy, and lie for\r\nseveral weeks in a nearly comatose condition. In this state they are\r\ntoo dull to be either timid or ill-tempered. On the other hand, when\r\ncasting their skins, they are exceedingly nervous and vicious.\r\n\r\nAll snakes are flesh eaters, and have very hearty appetites. They drink\r\na large amount of water, and when a captive snake is well supplied\r\nwith water, it can live for several weeks without food. However, it is\r\ndoubtless hungry, and the experiment is a cruel one to try even on a\r\nsnake.\r\n\r\nThe serpents have many teeth, sharp, cone-like, and pointing backward.\r\nThese teeth grow constantly; when they become at last old and\r\nworthless, they are at once renewed. Lucky snakes! no toothless gums,\r\nno worn-out, broken teeth, no aching teeth, no dentist’s bills. Nature\r\nkeeps their teeth perfect from infancy to old age.\r\n\r\nSnakes lay eggs, and with the one exception of the python, which\r\ncarries her eggs in a fold of her body, they deposit the eggs in safe\r\nplaces, leave them to hatch by sun heat, and let the little ones take\r\ncare of themselves as soon as they come forth from the eggs. There are\r\nalso a few species of snakes which have their little ones born alive,\r\nnot in the egg. Snakes’ eggs are enclosed in a leathery skin like\r\nthose of turtles. There is a widely spread story that the young of\r\nsome kinds of snakes accompany their mother, and in time of danger she\r\nstretches open her mouth, and they take refuge in her throat, where\r\nthey remain safely until the danger is passed. The keepers of the\r\n“snake-house” in the London Zoological Garden told me they had never\r\nknown a case of the kind, and the best scientific writers have found no\r\nproofs that such story is true. Therefore this tale is open to grave\r\ndoubts.\r\n\r\nThe snake is a creature about which fables have been gathering from\r\nthe earliest times. The snake was one of the first objects of false\r\nworship; coiled in a ring with its tail in its mouth, it was taken as\r\na symbol of eternity. The Magi of the East used it as the emblem of\r\ntheir order and their arts; a serpent twined on a stick was also the\r\nemblem of physicians, and of the art of healing. It is strange that a\r\ncreature exhibiting so many deadly varieties should have been chosen as\r\nthe insignia of the physician, and not less strange that to the serpent\r\nshould have been attributed great wisdom. Snakes exhibit fear and\r\nanger, but almost no wisdom or anything that seems like reason. Nearly\r\nall domestic animals--ants, bees, spiders, and many fishes--show far\r\nmore forecast, ingenuity, architectural ability, than any snake. And\r\nyet “crafty as a snake,” “wise as a serpent,” are frequent expressions.\r\n\r\nSnakes vary greatly in their habits: there are snakes which live on the\r\nground, hiding under stones, leaves, or brush, and in rock crevices;\r\nother snakes live chiefly in the water, making their holes in the bank\r\nbelow water-mark; others live in trees, and some others almost entirely\r\nunderground.\r\n\r\nTo this tribe surrounded by enemies, nature has given abundant means of\r\nself-preservation,--swiftness of motion; instinct of instant flight;\r\npoison, sometimes deadly to its enemies; vast size and strength, as\r\nin some boas and pythons, and especially colorations, which closely\r\nimitate their surroundings. Thus ground snakes have, especially on the\r\nback and sides, brown, gray, black, and white in spots and markings,\r\nwhich together look much like earth, twigs, pebbles, and dead leaves,\r\nso that the snake can scarcely be distinguished from its bed or home.\r\nTree snakes, and snakes that live in grass or mosses, are usually\r\ngreen, marbled, or streaked with black and brown. Snakes from the\r\nmarshes or muddy banks are nearly black; among the abundant flowers and\r\ngayly colored shrubs of the tropics, snakes take very brilliant hues.\r\nSnakes of temperate climates are also often tricked out with scarlet,\r\nor white or orange stripes and bands.\r\n\r\nSnakes are largest, most numerous, and most brightly colored in hot\r\ncountries. Like all the cold-blooded vertebrates, they delight in hot\r\nsunshine, and will lie motionless, basking for hours. In taking a\r\nposition for this sun-bath, they select a place where they will not be\r\nconspicuous. I have often noticed that while a gray snake will stretch\r\nitself out in the sun on a bare rock, a green snake never chooses such\r\na post. Instead, the green snake extends itself on a bed of moss, or\r\nclose, short grass, or if slim and light of body, will crawl up the\r\nmidrib of a big leaf, or the stalk of a fern frond, where its color\r\nis scarcely discernible from the vegetation about it. A dark brown or\r\nblack snake seems to know that it is tolerably secure lying upon a\r\nfallen, decaying tree-trunk. So a gray, or black and white snake, may\r\noften be seen sunning himself on a fence-rail, or on the top of a stone\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a common notion that because a creature is a snake,\r\nit must be dangerous and poisonous. This is quite wrong, for in point\r\nof fact, very few of the numerous serpent families are venomous. The\r\ngreater number of their species are quite harmless. One of the most\r\ndangerous of all snakes, the boa-constrictor, does not kill its prey\r\nby poisoning, but by crushing it. In general, the head of the harmless\r\nsnake is rounded and oblong, while the poisonous species have heads\r\nflat and triangular.\r\n\r\nSnakes prey upon birds, toads, rats, mice, frogs, gophers, and destroy\r\nmuch harmful vermin. The common snakes, called “milk snakes” and\r\n“garter snakes,” which frequent barns, are not at all poisonous, but,\r\non the contrary, are useful, destroying rats and mice. Nearly all\r\nsnakes are very fond of milk, and will glide up to a bowl of bread and\r\nmilk, especially if it is warmed, and eat it with great relish. Black\r\nsnakes are seldom harmful to people, but are cruel enemies of birds,\r\ndevouring the young and the eggs, and tearing up the nests.\r\n\r\nSnakes seem to be able to “charm” or mesmerize small animals, and\r\nsometimes even human beings, by fixing their gaze steadfastly upon\r\nthem. The victim appears to be smitten dumb and motionless with terror,\r\nand a bird thus charmed will presently flutter straight toward the open\r\nmouth of the snake. I have seen one case of a snake so charming a bird,\r\nbut I had a better opportunity to study a cat charming a bird, and\r\nprobably the process is much alike in both.\r\n\r\nThe cat placed itself on the outside sill of my window, near to a\r\npine tree. A bird presently alighted on the pine tree, no doubt not\r\nobserving the cat. The cat fixed its attention on the bird. The cat’s\r\neyes were widely opened, and shone with a peculiar brightness; its head\r\nwas raised and intent, the fur on its neck and about its face slowly\r\nstood up, as if electrified. Except for this rising of the fur, and a\r\ncertain intensity of life in the whole attitude of the beast, it was as\r\nstill as if cut from stone. The bird quivered, trembled, looked fixedly\r\nat the cat, and finally, with a feeble shake of the wings, fell toward\r\nthe cat, which bounded to seize it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[74] Nature Reader, No. 3, Scales and Teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XL.\r\n\r\nOUR COMMON ENEMY.\r\n\r\n    “Within the shadow of the ship\r\n      I watched their rich attire,\r\n    Blue, glossy green, and velvet black,\r\n    They coiled and shone, and every track\r\n      Was a flash of golden fire!”\r\n\r\n                              --COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day while sitting at dinner I heard a loud outcry from some\r\nbluebirds, especial pets of mine, which had their nest in a little\r\ngrove of dwarf oaks near my house. Hurrying out to inquire into the\r\ntroubles of my favorites, I saw the mother bird sitting on a twig, her\r\nwings dropped wide and slack, her tail drooping, her head stretched\r\nforward, quivering with fear; the father bird was flying about crying\r\nwildly, while on a limb of the oak, and approaching the nest, was a\r\nlarge black snake. The nest was full of nearly hatched eggs.\r\n\r\nTo throw a big stone at the snake was the first performance. Then some\r\none ran for a cane to beat the monster; but the snake had concluded\r\nthat discretion was the better part of valor, and waited only to\r\nreceive one good blow, before he glided off among the bushes so swiftly\r\nthat we could not find him. Where these big climbing snakes are\r\nnumerous, the birds have a hard time to raise a brood, for the snakes\r\ndestroy the nests, and devour alike parents and fledglings.\r\n\r\nExcept for their attacks on the birds, tree-climbing snakes are\r\nusually of the harmless kind, and are sometimes even useful. There is,\r\nhowever, a tree snake in hot countries, which seems to have a spiteful\r\ndisposition, and darts from the branches at the eyes and faces of\r\npassers-by, often inflicting a sharp, though not poisonous wound.\r\n\r\nI once formed the acquaintance of a girl who acted as “snake-charmer”\r\nin a museum. She astonished the public by going into a glass cage\r\nfilled with snakes, which she handled and played with. She held the\r\nsnakes in her lap, twined them about her neck and arms, and made free\r\nwith them in many ways. She told me confidentially, that while these\r\nsnakes looked as if they were terrible monsters, they were the most of\r\nthem fangless and of harmless varieties. Those which were of poisonous\r\nspecies had been rendered safe playthings by having their fangs cut out.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous snakes have a poison sac or bag, which empties into a\r\nlittle duct or canal running along each side of the jaw to a large\r\ntooth or fang; by an action of the throat muscles, the serpent presses\r\npoison from the sac through the canal, and ejects it through the tooth\r\nas it bites. By cutting out the fangs the snake is rendered harmless,\r\nbut only for the time being. The poison apparatus reproduces itself,\r\nand unless the process of growth is watched and the fang again cut\r\nout, the lately harmless snake may suddenly become harmful, and the\r\nsnake-charmer be fatally wounded.\r\n\r\n“The poisonous ones do not keep from biting because I charm them, or\r\nbecause they like me,” said the snake-charmer frankly. “Snakes never\r\nknow or like anybody, so far as I can see; it is only that they can’t\r\nbite, that’s all. Folks think the snakes love me because they coil\r\nabout me. It is only because I am warm that they do that. They are cold\r\ncreatures, the snakes, and they like the heat of my arms, neck, and\r\nlap, that’s all.”\r\n\r\nAmong the snakes without poison glands are the pythons, the species\r\nthat watches over and incubates its eggs. The mother python coils\r\nherself round and over the eggs, and for three months retains this\r\nposition, until the little ones are hatched. She seems to be very fond\r\nof her young, and is the model mother of all the snake tribe. The\r\nlarger pythons eat birds, cats, rabbits, hares, frogs, and dogs. They\r\nseldom meddle with human beings in any way. The sand snakes are nearly\r\nrelated to the pythons and are also non-poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe largest of all snakes, the boa-constrictor, belongs to the same\r\nsub-order as the python, and would be harmless if it were not for its\r\nrabid appetite, which tempts it to devour every living thing which it\r\nsees, while its great strength enables it to master almost any prey.\r\nThus it will wind about a man, an ox, or a horse, and crush such\r\nvictims to death, and feed upon them at leisure. The boas and most of\r\nthe pythons are natives of hot countries.\r\n\r\nA man who had long been a sailor gave me an account of the capture\r\nof a boa-constrictor, which is now in the London Zoological Garden.\r\nThis sailor wanted to go to the interior of the island of Java, to see\r\nthe country. When he landed in Java he met an English gentleman, Sir\r\nHenry ----, who was fond of travel and hunting, and had come to Java\r\nintending to capture some wild animals to present to the Regent’s Park\r\nZoological Garden. A rajah of Java had invited Sir Henry to go to his\r\nbungalow in the central part of the island, and have a big hunt. Sir\r\nHenry offered to take the sailor along to aid him. They caught a tiger\r\nand several other beasts, and I will describe to you the way in which\r\nthey captured a boa-constrictor.\r\n\r\nThey found a place in the forest, where the crushed grass and brush\r\nshowed that a boa frequently passed by. Then at evening, they fastened\r\na goat to a tree that its crying might attract the big snake. For\r\ntwo or three nights something carried off the goat, or it managed to\r\nescape. Finally they chained the goat. The hunters were watching and\r\nwaiting some way off. At last they heard cries from the goat, which\r\ncries the natives said meant that a snake was coming. Then all was\r\nstill, and they said that meant that the boa was eating the goat.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they hurried to the spot. There, stretched out his full\r\nlength, lay a huge boa; he had swallowed the goat, which distended the\r\nfront part of his body so that he would have had hard work to move,\r\neven if he had not been held by the chain attached to the swallowed\r\ngoat. This chain was fastened to a plane tree, and held the boa fast,\r\nas he could not disgorge the goat. The boa does not dismember or chew\r\nits food; it crushes it, and swallows it whole. Then it lies quiet, and\r\nwaits for the mass to digest. Thus the boa was captured by the chain\r\ndown its throat.\r\n\r\nSeveral strong natives now leaped upon the monster’s tail and held\r\nit down. Others laid a long, thick bamboo on each side of the boa,\r\nfrom head to tail. Then with strong, new ropes they wound and bound\r\nthe snake to the bamboos until he was stiffly imprisoned. Next they\r\nreleased the chain from the tree, and left the end dangling from the\r\nsnake’s greedy mouth. Then a dozen or more strong natives picked up the\r\nbamboo sticks, with the great serpent between them, and marched off to\r\nthe coast, where a cage had been prepared for it on an English ship.\r\n\r\nThe sub-order which includes the greatest snakes in the world, as the\r\nboas, pythons, and anacondas, includes also some of the very smallest,\r\ntiny creatures not over an inch in diameter and a few inches in length.\r\nThese snakes exhibit every variety of color and marking,--green,\r\ngold, crimson, white, black, brown, violet, yellow; they gleam in the\r\nsplendors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\nI remember once on a crest of the Lehigh Mountains I was looking up\r\nsome of the lower vertebrates, when, happening to glance over the side\r\nof a big stone on which I was sitting, I saw the most beautiful little\r\nsnake that I could imagine. It was coiled up in the sun, and was only\r\nabout ten inches long, and less than one inch in diameter. It was of\r\na vivid emerald green color, and as the sun touched its tiny scales\r\nthey seemed bordered and powdered with gold. The under part of its\r\nbody paled to pea green and silver white, a few dots of red glittered\r\nabout its neck and shoulders, like coral beads. Its wide-open mouth was\r\nreddish and bordered with yellow. Its tiny tongue played like lightning\r\nto and fro, caught the sunshine, and gleamed as if dipped in gold.\r\nAlarmed at seeing me, and afraid to leave its retreat on the sunny side\r\nof the stone, it erected its head with a low hiss, darted it from side\r\nto side, and seemed to try to frighten me away.\r\n\r\nAlmost as pretty as this little dweller on the mountains are some of\r\nthe water snakes, which are often iridescent, and change in tints of\r\nred, purple, crimson, orange, and green. Good swimmers and fishers,\r\nthey pass a happy life among the lily-pads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLI.\r\n\r\nWITH A HOUSE ON HIS BACK.\r\n\r\n    And through the mossy wood-paths slow\r\n    I see the silent tortoise go.\r\n    The flecks of light, the shadows dim,\r\n    The springing flowers, are naught to him;\r\n    The dry pine needles are his bed,\r\n    His house is always o’er his head,\r\n    The fungus is his table spread.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, walking one morning in a wood in Pennsylvania, I\r\nsurprised a wood turtle or box tortoise, eating his breakfast. The\r\nseason had been rainy and many varieties of large fungus had attained\r\na prodigal growth. The woods were full of what are popularly called\r\ntoad-stools; many of them were of the diameter of a tea-plate, and\r\nstood five or six inches high. As I walked through the wood I observed\r\nthat many of these fungi had been gnawed off evenly, as if cut by a\r\nknife, leaving only the central pillar intact. What had done this? I\r\nsoon discovered; for moving noiselessly over the mossy earth, I came to\r\na little opening, where grew one of the finest of these toad-stools,\r\nand there was a wood turtle taking his breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe animal had already made one or two rounds of his plate, and was\r\neating with praiseworthy deliberation. He would bite off a mouthful of\r\ntoad-stool, chew it carefully until he had extracted all the juice,\r\nthen open his mouth and drop out the chewed fibre, and take a fresh\r\nmouthful, not biting inward toward the stem, but breaking off the\r\nmorsel next beside that which he had just eaten. He paced round and\r\nround the fungus as he took his bites, eating his plate like Æneas and\r\nthe other Trojans,[75] and as the fungus decreased in regular circles,\r\nthe circle of chewed fragments increased. In three-quarters of an hour\r\nhe had eaten all the disk of the fungus to the stem part, and then he\r\nwalked slowly off to look for another.\r\n\r\nI found the crumbs that had fallen from his vanished table quite dry,\r\nnothing nutritious being left in them. Why he rejected the central\r\npart of the fungus and the stem, I could not imagine, but he left it\r\nin every instance. If he came upon a decayed or wormy portion of the\r\ntoad-stool, he did not “bite round it,” but abandoned it altogether,\r\nand went for a fresh one.\r\n\r\nAt another turn in this wood, I found, under a pine tree, the shell\r\nand entire skeleton of a turtle, from which every particle of flesh\r\nand muscle was gone. The animal had died on his bed of pine needles,\r\nand his decaying body had been devoured by ants, which had left a\r\ndelicately white skeleton. The little horny jaw had a very close\r\nresemblance to the beaks of certain birds.\r\n\r\nThe turtle is a four-legged reptile, with a short, stout, oval-shaped\r\nbody, encased in a bony frame or box, from which the animal is able\r\nto protrude its head, legs, and tail, and into which it can withdraw\r\nthem at pleasure. In different varieties of turtle, the size and shape\r\nof the box-like covering varies. The box tortoise can retire into its\r\nshell and close the under part into a groove of the upper edge, and\r\nthus form for itself an impregnable retreat; but there are varieties\r\nonly partly encased by the shell, which cannot bring their heads and\r\nfeet under cover.\r\n\r\nThe turtle wanders about with its house on its back as the snail does,\r\nand against its enemies it can close its doors and be emphatically “not\r\nat home.” Turtles have keen sight and hearing; they have no teeth, the\r\njaws being simply cased in horn, like those of birds. Many of them are\r\ncapable of making loud sounds.\r\n\r\nTurtles lay eggs which are buried in earth or sand, and left to\r\nthemselves to hatch. The sea turtle is the largest variety, and will\r\nsometimes lay as many as two hundred eggs in a single heap. Sea turtles\r\nweighing a thousand pounds have been caught in tropical lands. Turtles\r\nof five or six hundred pounds weight have been captured on the United\r\nStates coast.\r\n\r\nIn the four species of marine turtles, the feet are flat and\r\nfin-shaped. In one the shell is rather leathery than horny. Some of\r\nthese marine turtles are carnivorous, living on fish, mollusks, and\r\ncrustaceans; others are strictly vegetarian, feeding only on roots\r\nand various sea-weeds. The flesh of some of the sea turtles is rich\r\nand delicious, and a favorite and costly article of food; but of some\r\nothers the flesh is coarse and strongly flavored, so as to be quite\r\nuneatable. The eggs are always sweet, good, and wholesome food. The\r\nshell of the sea turtle is a valuable article of commerce, boxes,\r\ncases, handles for knives, jewelry and other delicate ornamental things\r\nbeing made from it; it is susceptible of a high polish, which brings\r\nout clearly its rich brown and golden shades and markings.\r\n\r\nNext to the marine turtles, come the fresh-water or river turtles.\r\nThese eat both animal and vegetable food. They enjoy lying in a bed of\r\nmud, their heads lifted above the surface of the stagnant water, their\r\nlong necks moving snake-like to and fro as they take mouthfuls of air.\r\nThe fresh-water turtles are generally gregarious in their habits, large\r\nnumbers of them being found together. They are fond of lying in the sun\r\non logs or banks, near the water, into which they promptly slide at the\r\nfirst hint of danger. They are timid creatures, but if caught will snap\r\nand bite furiously.\r\n\r\nSalt and fresh water terrapins are a variety of turtle. Some scientists\r\ndistinguish the turtle from the tortoise thus: the turtle is a marine\r\nanimal, does not hibernate, cannot draw its head and feet inside its\r\nshell. The tortoise never goes to sea; can draw itself entirely within\r\nits shell, though only the box tortoise can close the shell fast when\r\nso withdrawn, and finally, the tortoise hibernates. Some of the best\r\nand latest writers on the subject call all these animals turtles,\r\ngiving the name tortoise to the box tortoise of the wood.\r\n\r\nClumsy as turtles appear in their box-like covering, they can walk\r\nrapidly on land, are climbers of some distinction, and all of them\r\ncan swim. The head, neck, and legs of a turtle are of a uniform\r\ncolor,--bronze, blackish green, or deep brown. The shells or boxes\r\nare beautifully marked, glossy, ribbed, ridged, or carved, and made\r\nup of closely united many-sided plates, fitted upon a thickened,\r\nlighter-colored, uniform plate. This shell is not brittle and\r\nlime-like, as the shells of mollusks, but is more like horn.\r\n\r\nIn general, the shell or flat covering of the under part of the body is\r\nof a lighter color than the upper case, being light brown, yellow, or\r\ncream color, with yellow lines dividing the plates, and bordering bands\r\nof red, yellow, or purple. The upper shell is usually of a very dark\r\ncolor, marked and lined with darker and lighter tints, and often with a\r\nbevelled yellow edge.\r\n\r\nThe painted turtle receives its name from the beauty of its\r\nmany-colored shell. The spotted turtle, often called the wood turtle,\r\nis distinguished by fine yellow spots sprinkled over its black back.\r\nThe turtle which I saw feasting on the fungus was the common box\r\ntortoise. This box tortoise prefers dry woods, and dislikes the water.\r\nIt is a long-lived creature. Some specimens have been known to live\r\nover a hundred years. A box tortoise that I had, ate meat, insects,\r\nand bread and milk from my hand, but if I put berries in its mouth it\r\nwiped them out with its front foot used hand-wise, in a very funny\r\nway. When it wanted to get away from the balcony, it crawled along the\r\nedge looking over, its neck outstretched; when it seemed to decide to\r\ngo over it suddenly drew itself close into its shell, and making some\r\nquick jerk while quite shut up, over it went, came down safe in the\r\ngrass, and walked away. I watched it do that many times and was never\r\nquite sure how it flung itself “overboard” after it was safely shut up.\r\n\r\nThe snapping turtle is a common variety. It has a box or shell too\r\nsmall to close over it and hide it completely. To make up for this\r\nlack, it has a bold and hasty temper, and snaps vigorously when\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\nThe gopher is the turtle of the southern pine countries. It is a large,\r\nstrong animal, with a shell fifteen inches long. These gopher turtles\r\nlive in troops, a number of families digging their dens or burrows near\r\ntogether. The entrance to the den is about four feet long and expands\r\ninto a spacious room. In each burrow lives a single pair of gophers.\r\nGophers’ eggs are as large as pigeons’ eggs, and the eggs and flesh\r\nare prized by the negroes as food. By day gophers stay at home, by\r\nnight they wander out and devour yams, melons, corn, and other garden\r\nproduce. They dislike wet, and go indoors when it rains.\r\n\r\nA near relative of the gopher is found in Europe, and is often kept\r\nabout the house for a pet. If it can find its way into a garden in the\r\nautumn it digs a hole and hibernates, coming forth in the spring. A\r\nfriend of mine in London had one of these animals which lived in the\r\nkitchen. It was fond of creeping into the fire-place and getting under\r\nthe grate, where it would lie until the hot coals and ashes dropped\r\nupon its back and burnt its shell. When winter came this little animal\r\nwanted to take its long sleep, and dug so persistently into boxes,\r\nbaskets, drawers, and closets that finally a box of earth was given to\r\nit, into which it worked its way until out of sight, and there stayed\r\nuntil April. It ate potatoes, carrots, turnips, and bread and milk,\r\nwhich it specially liked.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[75] The harpies, we are told, frightened Æneas by saying he would\r\nbe so hungry that he would eat his plate. But as the Trojans at one\r\nof their meals used big cakes of bread for plates, the prophecy was\r\nharmlessly fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLII.\r\n\r\nA REAL LIVE MERMAID.\r\n\r\n    “The waters pushed, the waters swelled,\r\n      A fisher sat near by,\r\n    And earnestly his line he held,\r\n      With tranquil heart and eye;\r\n    And while he sits and watches there\r\n      He sees the waves divide,\r\n    And lo! a maid with glistening hair\r\n      Springs from the troubled tide.”\r\n\r\n                         --GOETHE, _Trans._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I was a child I was greatly fascinated with tales of mermaids,\r\nfabulous damsels who lived in the ocean. They had beautiful faces and\r\narms, and long, pale green hair, which they combed with golden combs,\r\nand decked with sea-weeds and pearls. They swain like fish, and sang\r\nmost sweetly. When I learned that mermaids were only creatures of\r\nfancy, and did not really exist, I felt as if I had been robbed of\r\nfriends. A few years later a bronzed, wrinkled old fisherman restored\r\nto me my mermaids as real creatures, even more interesting than the sea\r\nmaids of myth. And so there is a real live mermaid!\r\n\r\nWhere shall we find her? My old sailor said he first met her some miles\r\nout at sea, in the latitude of Florida. She was swimming along at ease,\r\nher head held above water, and she carried on her arm her baby, whose\r\nhead she stuck up above the waves.\r\n\r\nWas she beautiful? Had she large, lovely eyes? No; her face was\r\nsomething like that of a cow, but instead of the large black eyes of\r\na cow, she had tiny eyes, smaller than those of a pig. But were not\r\nher arms beautiful? No; her arms were flat, short, somewhat of an oval\r\nshape; in fact, they were flippers rather than arms, though she had\r\nfree use of the elbow, shoulder, and wrist joints. She had no hands, no\r\nfingers, but at the end of each flipper were three small, flat nails.\r\nHad she long, waving hair? No; she had a few coarse hairs about her\r\nface, and a scanty covering of very fine, short hairs over her body.\r\nCould she sing? Unfortunately all real mermaids are dumb. Finally, was\r\nshe of a sea-green color? Not at all; her skin was very thick, and of a\r\ndark gray, finely wrinkled all over, very like the skin of an elephant.\r\nHer upper lip was divided into two deep lobes, and she had no lower\r\nlimbs, but instead a tail, with a wide, strong fin.\r\n\r\nOh, an ugly, horrible creature! By no means; on the contrary, as\r\namiable, mild, gentle, playful, kindly a creature as ever drew breath.\r\nA fish, of course! Indeed not: a mammal; a mammal of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe class mammalia has orders of animals that live in the sea; other\r\norders of creatures that live mostly in the air, and very many other\r\ncreatures that live on the land, and some that spend their lives\r\nunder ground. Any animal that suckles its young is a mammal, whether\r\na swimming, flying, walking, climbing, or burrowing creature. The sea\r\nmammals are the whales, dolphins, porpoises, dugongs, and this mermaid.\r\n\r\nOur mermaid is called by sailors a “sea cow” from the shape of its head\r\nand face; a “river calf” from its size and habit of living in rivers;\r\nthe most common and best name for it is that given it by the early\r\nSpanish colonists, the manatee, or handed animal, because it can so\r\nskilfully use its fore limbs or flippers.\r\n\r\nOnce there were manatees in many different parts of the world. They\r\nwere numerous in the Indian Ocean and in Behring Sea; but they have\r\nbeen so recklessly slaughtered that now the creature is nearly unknown,\r\nexcept a few in Africa near Cape Verde and the Cape of Good Hope; some\r\nfew along the coast of South America, and those that inhabit the rivers\r\nof Florida. The manatee, like the buffalo of the Western plains, is\r\nlikely soon to be extinct.\r\n\r\nThe manatees of the Eastern hemisphere seem to have been much larger\r\nthan those of Florida.[76] Eight or ten feet is the usual length of\r\nthe American manatee. Efforts have been made to raise the animals in\r\ncaptivity, but they do not thrive. One was kept sixteen months in\r\nthe aquarium at Brighton, England, and was fed on lettuce, cabbage,\r\nturnips, thistles, and dandelions. Let us now look at the animal in its\r\nfavorite home, the Santa Lucia River in Florida.\r\n\r\nManatees live in droves or herds, and prefer shallow to deep water.\r\nWhen they move up the river they keep well to the centre of the stream,\r\nas they are very timid. They rest near to the banks where they find\r\nplenty of grass and lily-pads to shelter them. Manatees come from the\r\nWest Indies and Central and South America to the Santa Lucia River, to\r\nrear their young among the thick vegetation. They arrive early in May\r\nand remain until late in the autumn.\r\n\r\nHere is our manatee; let us take a good look at it. It has a gray\r\nwrinkled skin; no fin on the back; a stiff, thick, shovel-shaped tail,\r\nwith a flat tail-fin; a moderate sized oval head with small eyes; a\r\nvery small under lip. The nostrils are two slits of a half-moon shape;\r\nthe ear is a little orifice, set not far behind the eye. The sight\r\nof the manatee is good, but its hearing is something extraordinary.\r\nProbably no other animal has ears so acute. If a blade of grass or a\r\nleaf drops into the water the manatee hears it and darts away, for it\r\nis as timid as it is harmless.\r\n\r\nTo the shoulders of the manatee are attached the flipper-like arms,\r\nwhich it uses so readily. When in shallow water the creature supports\r\nitself on the ends of the flippers and the tail, and thus raising its\r\nbody it moves slowly about the sandy river bottom. Its food is purely\r\nvegetable, and it is interesting to watch it eat. If you notice a\r\ncaterpillar, or a silkworm feeding on a leaf, you get a notion of the\r\nmethod of the manatee in eating, and its use of its odd double lip.\r\n\r\nHold out a cabbage leaf to a manatee which has been kept in a tank as\r\na pet--for though timid they are affectionate when kindly treated; the\r\ngentle beast extends its head toward the leaf, and in so doing parts\r\nthe lobes of the upper lip, leaving a wide gap. As soon as the leaf is\r\nwithin this space, the lip lobes come together and hold the leaf firmly\r\nwith their bristly surfaces. Then the lobes draw backwards, and the\r\nleaf is thus pushed into the mouth where there are some twelve teeth\r\nto chew it. The mermaid has in all twenty-two teeth, but some fall out\r\nbefore others come, so it generally has twelve in its mouth at one time.\r\n\r\nWhile the manatee lives constantly in the water, it breathes air\r\nthrough its nostrils into its lungs. To secure air it comes to the\r\nsurface of the water once in every three or four minutes. When it thus\r\nrises it will blow like a whale and send a spout of spray and water\r\ntwelve or fifteen feet into the air. It seems to enjoy this blowing; it\r\nalso enjoys rolling itself on the sand and fine pebbles in the bottom\r\nof the stream. It rolls and plunges to cleanse its skin; it is its way\r\nof making its toilet. After a roll the manatee rises to the surface,\r\nparts its lip lobes, gives a good blow, draws in all the air it can,\r\nand returns below.\r\n\r\nLily pods and pads, bananas,[77] a coarse river grass called manatee\r\ngrass, are its favorite food. A large manatee will eat three bushels of\r\nlily-pods in a day.\r\n\r\nThe manatee is a strong, swift swimmer, and dives with wonderful\r\nagility. In its favorite haunt, the Santa Lucia River, the mermaid’s\r\nbabies are born among the lily-leaves, and in that green and pleasant\r\nnursery, the clean white sand for their bed, the fragrant lilies\r\nrocking on the water, the butterflies and dragon-flies darting out and\r\nin among the shadows, and the birds singing and sporting above them,\r\nthey live for several weeks. When they are quite small their mothers\r\ncarry them around in their flippers if they seem tired or do not go\r\nfast enough, but the manatee baby can swim as soon as it is born.\r\n\r\nBeing now very scarce, the manatee is largely increased in value. One\r\nfifteen feet long would cost two or even three thousand dollars. A\r\nlarge skeleton is worth a thousand dollars. The hides and flesh have\r\nbeen so much sought after that the creatures have been hunted nearly\r\nout of existence. Formerly the Indians made light, strong, and handsome\r\ncanoes of manatee skins.\r\n\r\nThe manatee is very hard to kill; being timid, it darts away at the\r\nfirst alarm, and its swimming speed is exceedingly rapid if it is\r\nfrightened; its thick skin, remarkably large, strong bones, and a thick\r\nlayer of fat under its skin protect it in a great measure from injury\r\nby a bullet. The general method of securing the animal is to drive\r\nit into a very large, strong net. One side of the net is sunk to the\r\nriver bottom, the other rises to the top of the water, and is then\r\ndrawn about the hiding-place of the manatee. After a little training it\r\nwill come when it is called, will eat from one’s hand, and likes to be\r\npetted and to have its head rubbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] The rhytina and dugong are not, as some suppose, manatees, but\r\nanimals closely allied to true manatees.\r\n\r\n[77] When in captivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIII.\r\n\r\nGREAT WHALES ALSO.\r\n\r\n    “So far I live to Northward\r\n        No man lives North of me;\r\n    To the East are wild mountain chains,\r\n    And beyond them meres and plains;\r\n        To the Westward, all is sea.”\r\n\r\n                           --LONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany people think that a whale is a huge fish, the largest of the\r\nfish class. This idea is entirely wrong; a whale is not a fish, but a\r\nmammal. It belongs to the same class as the cow, sheep, horse, lion,\r\nmonkey, and man, because all these widely differing creatures are\r\nborn alive, and not in an egg, and when young are nourished by their\r\nmothers’ milk. The mammalian class, distinguished in this way by\r\nsuckling the young, is divided into many orders, and to one of these,\r\nthe cetacean, or whale order, the whales give their name.\r\n\r\nThe whale is the largest of all living mammals; it is a mammal of the\r\nsea, and has a fish-like body because its home is constantly in the\r\nwaters. A whale is entirely helpless when cast upon the land; it is\r\nunable to move itself, or to find anything to eat. Out of water it will\r\nsoon die, but not because it is unable to breathe air, as is the case\r\nwith the fishes.[78]\r\n\r\nThe whale breathes air through its nostrils into lungs; it does not\r\nhave gills, and therefore while in the water it must constantly come\r\nto the surface for air. Thus the principal motion of the whale in\r\nthe water is up and down, coming to the surface, and then seeking the\r\ndepths. To aid it in this motion the whale’s tail expands sidewise or\r\nhorizontally, and not up and down or vertically, as do the tails of\r\nmost fishes which chiefly swim straight forward, or in large curves.\r\n\r\nLet us look at a whale. Its body is cone-shaped; the head is very\r\nlarge, sometimes one-third of the animal’s entire length; there is no\r\nnotch of the body to mark the neck;[79] the body tapers to the tail,\r\nwhich is widely expanded on each side into what are called flukes, and\r\nthus becomes a very strong propeller. Just behind the head we find a\r\npair of fore limbs, called paddles or flippers. These are flat and\r\noval, and have externally no marks of joints, fingers, or nails. But if\r\nyou examine the skeleton of a whale, you will find that this limb is\r\ndivided into arm and hand bones, very much like those of your own arms\r\nand fingers. There are no external signs of hind limbs, but in some\r\nkinds of whales we find in the skeletons some small, soft bones like a\r\nhint of legs.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the whale is smooth, of a dark gray or black color, and\r\nwithout hair except a few bristles around the mouth. Under the skin is\r\nspread a layer of several inches of fat, called blubber. This layer\r\nof blubber serves to keep the whale warm, and also to render its huge\r\nbody light, so that it will float easily; it also keeps it from being\r\nreadily injured. Most whales have a low, narrow fin down the centre of\r\nthe back, to aid them in keeping a proper position in the water.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine more particularly the whale’s big head; it has small\r\neyes, and a pair of tiny holes for ears. These ears are close behind\r\nthe eyes, but the nostrils are usually placed on top of the head. In\r\nnearly all varieties of whales we find teeth inside the large mouth.\r\nIn one very important species there are no teeth, but instead, we find\r\na large number of horny plates. The whale’s mouth opens very wide, and\r\nthe lips are stiff and immovable, not soft and flexible like our own.\r\n\r\nMost people have read of the _blowing_ or spouting of the whale, when\r\nit sends a double stream of water from its nostrils up into the air.\r\nThe general idea is that the whale takes this water in at the mouth,\r\nand then spurts it up into the air through the nostrils, as a matter of\r\namusement. This is not true. When a whale comes to the surface he takes\r\nin a large amount of air, and returns below; most of this air becomes\r\nchanged to steam or vapor, as the animal remains below for some time.\r\nThen the whale comes up for more air, and the first thing is to free\r\nhis lungs of the heated, vaporized air that is already in them. The\r\nanimal drives this air violently from its lungs through the nostrils,\r\nand rising into the cold atmosphere it is at once changed to spray by\r\ncondensation. The whale frequently begins to blow before it reaches the\r\ntop of the water, and so drives surface-water up with the vapor which\r\nit expels from its lungs.\r\n\r\nFishes, we know, have very little red blood; reptiles are cold-blooded\r\nanimals; but whales have plenty of warm, red blood. They are very\r\nstrong and active creatures in spite of their unwieldy size. The\r\nlightness afforded by their blubber, or sheath of fat, and the large\r\namount of air they can contain in their great lungs, and the strength\r\nof the tail with its wide flukes,[80] enable them to dash through the\r\nwater with amazing swiftness.\r\n\r\nMost of the “true whales” are flesh-eaters, with very fierce appetites.\r\nThey devour fishes, mollusks, crustaceans, and even seals or other\r\nwhales. They need enormous quantities of food to support such large\r\nbodies, for a Greenland sperm whale is sometimes seventy feet long, and\r\nfrom twenty to thirty feet thick through the shoulders. To secure the\r\nneeded amount of food, the vast mouth opens wide. In some whales a man\r\ncan stand upright between the extended jaws.\r\n\r\nIn the “right whale,” which has no teeth, the mouth is lined along the\r\nupper jaw with long, narrow plates or flakes called baleen, of which\r\nwhalebone is made. Every piece of whalebone is a strip of this baleen,\r\nfrom within the mouth of a right whale, and every such piece has a\r\nwonderful history behind it, for it has been floating, perhaps for many\r\nyears, through the cold Arctic seas. It could tell us rare tales if it\r\ncould speak.\r\n\r\nThese plates of baleen are sometimes seven yards long, and the mouth\r\nof one whale has about seven hundred plates. The chief food of this\r\nright, or whalebone whale, consists of very small brown crustaceans,\r\none of the numerous crab family. These creatures are so abundant in\r\nthe northern seas that they lie in banks many leagues long and several\r\nfeet thick. The whale feeds on these beds of living animals, as a cow\r\nbrowses on grass or hay.\r\n\r\nWhales are mild and inoffensive in disposition, unless greatly\r\nirritated by wounds and attack. They seldom quarrel among themselves,\r\nbut are playful and affectionate, while the mother shows intense\r\nfondness for her young. Whales are social animals, and go in herds, or\r\ngroups; one is seldom found alone.\r\n\r\nIn the spring the whales pair, and move off together to find some\r\nplace where they may rear their young. As they travel together they\r\nseem very lively and happy; they stop to feed, and indulge in frolics,\r\nleaping out of the water, tumbling over and over each other, turning\r\nsomersaults, and striving to show what they can do. As they come to\r\ninlets or deep, quiet bays, which may afford them a safe home, the male\r\nwhale goes to explore their fitness, or to see if the spot is already\r\ntaken by some other couple. This is the spring house-hunting of this\r\nfamous family, and while Mr. Whale enters to make inquiries, Mrs. Whale\r\nwaits outside. Finally, an abode is selected, and here the mother\r\nremains, until in autumn, one, or at most two, little baby whales are\r\nborn. Compared with their big mother they are small, but compared with\r\nhuman children they are giants.\r\n\r\nTo her little ones the mother whale gives devoted attention. She\r\nsuckles them for about two months, at the end of which time they are\r\nable to feed on crustaceans and small fish. Then the mother sets off\r\nwith her family to complete their education by taking them abroad in\r\nthe water-world. The baby whales can swim as soon as they are born, but\r\nnot so fast as their big mother, and she carefully accommodates her\r\npace to theirs. If danger threatens, she places herself between it and\r\nher child, and hastens the little one’s flight by pressing against it,\r\nand so shoving it through the water.\r\n\r\nIf there is need to go still faster, she sometimes grasps the young one\r\nbetween her flippers and her neck, and so swims with all her might,\r\ncarrying the little one off. If attacked, she will sacrifice her life\r\nrather than abandon her baby. When the baby whale is attacked, the\r\nusually mild mother shows great fury.\r\n\r\nA male whale also will defend his mate if she is attacked, swimming\r\nround and round her, blowing, lashing the waves with his powerful tail,\r\nand trying to overturn boats with his mighty head; he will die rather\r\nthan desert her. Such noble, loyal qualities shown by these animals\r\ndeepen our regret that through promiscuous slaughter, they are rapidly\r\ndiminishing in numbers, and are likely to disappear from the Northern\r\nhemisphere. Sharks, narwhals, and white bears are enemies of the whale,\r\nbut none of these brute hunters are as reckless and destructive in\r\ntheir warfare as men.\r\n\r\nThe sperm whale is more nearly allied to the porpoise than to the right\r\nwhale. From the sperm whale, oil, ivory, ambergris, and spermaceti\r\nare obtained, but no whalebone. The spermaceti, from which this whale\r\nderives its name, is found in a cistern-like reservoir over two yards\r\ndeep, placed near the brain cavity at the back of the whale’s head.\r\nThis reservoir contains many gallons of spermaceti.\r\n\r\nDolphins, narwhals, and rorquals, all belong to the whale family. The\r\nrorquals have larger fins than the other whales. The blue whale is the\r\nlargest of all the family.[81] The humpbacked whale is shorter and\r\nthicker than the other varieties, has a queerly shaped back fin, and\r\nlarge flippers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[78] See Nature Reader, No. 3, pp. 243-4.\r\n\r\n[79] Neck or nick, or notch.

LONGFELLOW, _in The Discoverer of the North Cape_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GARMENTS OF PRICE.]\r\n\r\nThe Arabian legends tell us of a magical carpet, upon which one can\r\nseat himself, and then, wishing to be in a certain place, the carpet\r\nrises into the air, and safely and swiftly carries him where he would\r\nbe. When Catherine showed to me a costly seal-skin coat, her Christmas\r\ngift, I proposed to her that we should use it as a magic carpet, and\r\nflying to the home of the fur seal, should trace the coat through all\r\nthe changes of its history.\r\n\r\n“Let us go at once!” cried Catherine.\r\n\r\n“If we go now,” I said, “not a seal shall we behold, for they are\r\nnow far off at sea. It will be useless to make our trip before the\r\nfifteenth of May.”\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth of May, accordingly, Catherine and I spread out the\r\nseal-skin coat and began our journey. We went northwest, crossed the\r\nhigh Rockies, left behind us the new State of Washington, moved still\r\nwest by north, and finally arrived at three small islands in Bering\r\nSea, called the Pribylov Islands, from a Russian who discovered them in\r\n1786. “Our fortune is good,” said I to Catherine; “this is just such\r\nweather as seals like. They delight in cool, moist, foggy days, so that\r\nthe sun is obscured, and casts no shadows. This is the usual weather\r\non the Pribylov Islands, where the sun shines clearly but few days in\r\nthe year. Seals spend about eight months in the water, and four months\r\nchiefly on the land. When they land they choose a dry locality of hard\r\nsand and pebbles, shelving toward the sea, so that no water or slime\r\nshall be left on the ground, for if their fur becomes matted with mud\r\nit falls out at once.”\r\n\r\n“Here we are at St. Paul’s Island; date, May eighteenth; day, mild and\r\nhazy. We stand on a ledge of rock, and to the left of us we see five\r\nor six giant seals walking. They come up on the rocky beach and calmly\r\ntake their places on large rocks and sit looking seawards; they are\r\nwatching for their mates, friends, and neighbors to arrive. We need\r\nnot fear to approach them; unless attacked, even the largest seal is\r\nentirely gentle. His eyesight is good, but only for moderate distances,\r\nbut his sense of smell is as keen as the hearing of a manatee. If we\r\nkeep on the side to which the wind is blowing, so that he cannot detect\r\nus by his sense of smell, we may approach close to him.\r\n\r\n“Look at him now. He is seven feet long, and weighs four hundred\r\npounds. He has a small, round head, the skull bones are thin and\r\nlight, and the brain fills almost the entire skull cavity, for the\r\nseal is a highly organized and very intelligent animal. The eyes are\r\nlarge, of a bluish hazel, and very beautiful; the nose is like that of\r\na Newfoundland dog, but the mouth has not loose skin like the dog’s\r\nmouth, but firm, well-outlined, human-like lips.\r\n\r\n“Open the mouth and there are large, sharp, dog-like teeth. A gray\r\nmoustache ornaments the upper lip, outdoing Victor Emmanuel’s in\r\nlength, and sweeping down upon the breast. At the back of the round\r\nhead are two small, pointed, drooping ears. The neck and shoulders\r\nare very large and heavy; the tail is merely an apology for a tail,\r\nbeing but four inches long. The seal has four limbs or flippers. The\r\nfront flippers are hairless, blue black, ten inches broad at the body,\r\neighteen inches long, and taper to a point. There are no fingers, and\r\nthe arm and the forearm are embraced in the body, and hidden under the\r\nskin and blubber. In fact, the flippers are only hands, the arm part\r\nremaining enclosed in the covering of the chest. These fore flippers\r\nare used as feet, the seal stepping on them with alternate up and down\r\nmovements, and carrying his head three feet from the ground, in an\r\nerect and graceful attitude.\r\n\r\n“The hind flippers are very odd. They are much longer than the front\r\nones, light, slender, and ribbon-like; they look like a pair of empty,\r\nwrinkled, black kid gloves. They are twenty-two inches long, and at a\r\nlittle distance from the ends have each three strong nails. The heels\r\nare horny and projecting, and on them the seal rests the hinder part of\r\nthe body, for the upper part of these hind flippers, bones, and joints\r\nare embraced in the body, as are the fore limbs. At every other step\r\nthe seal pauses and gives his hind flippers a sidewise fling, as if to\r\nkeep them out of harm’s way.\r\n\r\n“Having slowly walked up the beach, this seal, who is an adult male,\r\nseats himself and surveys the ocean, his front flippers hang idly\r\ndown, but he fans himself in the most comical style with his long,\r\nribbon-like, hind flippers. He is exceedingly fat; under his skin\r\nlie several inches of blubber, and well it is for him that he is so\r\nprovided, for now that he has come out of the water, he will not return\r\nthere nor taste food or drink for the next three or four months.[82]\r\nAll the time that he is on land he maintains an absolute fast. In the\r\nwater his food is fishes, crustaceans, and squids,[83] of which he eats\r\nenormous quantities.”\r\n\r\n“But the fur!” cries Catherine, “the fur! I see nothing on this beast\r\nlike my lovely, soft, dark cloak. This creature is covered with coarse\r\ngray hair.”\r\n\r\n“Step a little closer, my Catherine, and let us examine into this\r\nimportant matter. The seal wears two coats: the outer one is this\r\ncoarse, grizzly hair, the inner one is a short, close, soft, elastic,\r\nsilky fur. This fur is darkest on the back and shoulders, lightest on\r\nthe flanks and breast. This adult male seal does not have that glossy\r\nnut-brown, or that delicate light gray or cream-colored fur which\r\nbelongs to young seals, and to the females, and which presently we\r\nshall see prepared for your use.\r\n\r\n“These big seals have come out of the water to make ready for spring\r\nhousekeeping. Each one selects a dry, sloping place which will suit\r\nthe mothers and their little ones, and this home he is prepared to\r\ndefend against all intruders. About the fifteenth of June the mother\r\nseals begin to come out of the water. They are obliged to come out and\r\nnurse their little ones on land, as even a human baby will not be more\r\nhelpless in water, or drown more quickly than a baby seal.\r\n\r\n“As we watch the mother seals swimming toward land and walking up the\r\nbeach, we shall see that they are only about one-sixth of the size of\r\nthe big seals we have been examining. They are of a much more slender\r\nand graceful make, have remarkably handsome heads and necks, and are\r\nnot encumbered with the mass of blubber under the skin. They do not\r\nneed the blubber, for they go regularly into the water to feed, and\r\neven remain away two or three days, leaving the male seals to keep\r\nhouse and defend the children. Meantime these big seals fast and use up\r\ntheir store of blubber to maintain their vitality.\r\n\r\n“The big seals meet the mothers coming up the beach, and escort them to\r\ntheir homes and to comfortable seats among the rocks. The mother seals\r\nsit down and fan themselves with their flippers, and croon or sing.\r\nThey turn their pretty heads artlessly from side to side, and croon to\r\neach other. No mother seal will stay alone for a minute; from six to\r\nfifty mothers always keep together in one home.\r\n\r\n“The big male seal has four distinct calls or notes. He has a chuckling\r\nwhistle whereby he converses with the mother seals; a loud, angry roar\r\nfor any other big seal who meddles with his family; a low growl, with\r\nwhich he talks to himself; and a sound like a cat spitting, when he\r\nis alarmed. Mother seals have the crooning song for their mates, and\r\na bleat like a sheep for their little ones. Baby seals cry just like\r\nlittle lambs.\r\n\r\n“A mother seal seldom has more than one baby or “puppy” at a time.\r\nThese mothers are exceedingly gentle, patient creatures, and very\r\nquiet. On shore they fan themselves, croon, and curl up for cosy naps,\r\nbut the big seals are nervous and restless, and never sleep when ashore\r\nmore than a few minutes at a time.\r\n\r\n“Baby seals cannot swim. They make their ba-a-a-ing cry all the time\r\nthat they are awake. Their eyes are wide open at once; they are not\r\nblind at first, like kittens and puppies, but they do not know their\r\nmothers from any other seals. The mother seals know their own children\r\nby their cries, though to human ears their looks and cries are all\r\nexactly alike. No matter how far off the puppy may roll, no matter how\r\nmany scores of puppies are heaped into a warm, furry ba-a-a-ing heap,\r\nthe good little mothers can find each her own. Perhaps the sense of\r\nsmell aids them as well as the bleating cry.\r\n\r\n“The mother seal is not a very anxious nurse. She pays no heed if any\r\none picks up her baby, carries it off, or treads on it. She leaves it\r\nfor two or three days at a time, while she is off in the water enjoying\r\nherself; meantime the little one sleeps and ba-a-a-s, and does not seem\r\nto suffer from hunger. When the mother returns from her excursions she\r\ncurls down by her baby and gives it plenty of rich milk. These baby\r\nseals have dark blue eyes, but the eyes become browner after a while.\r\nAll seals have long, thick eyelashes.\r\n\r\n“As the baby seals grow older they begin to roll about the shore, which\r\nfrom much trampling has been worn into hollows filled with tide-water.\r\nThese hollows are muddy and the seal mothers do not wish their babies\r\nto get into them. The naughty little seals, like frolicsome children,\r\ntrot to the puddles and go into them a dozen times a day, and their\r\nmothers pull them out.\r\n\r\n“As the little ones reach the age of three months they go nearer the\r\nwater’s edge in their rambles and venture in. At first they cannot\r\nswim, and clamber out, sputtering and spitting and crying ba-a-a at the\r\ntop of their lungs. Still, after a little nap, they go back and try it\r\nagain and again, and in a few days they know how to swim; but they are\r\na full year old before they know how to dive, swim, fish, roll, and\r\nsleep in the water, as well as the adults.\r\n\r\n“In swimming the seal carries his long hind flippers stretched\r\nbackwards to serve as a rudder, and uses the fore flippers for\r\npropulsion. When the little ones can swim they are weaned, and they\r\nbetake themselves to the water to stay, and are able to catch squids\r\nand crustaceans for themselves. They are three or four months old when\r\nthey thus go to the water to find a home, and they do not come back\r\nfor two years. A seal can sleep as comfortably on the water as on\r\nshore. To sleep it turns on its back, holds its nose and feet above the\r\nsurface, and takes a profound nap, gently rocked by the waves.\r\n\r\n“While the young seals are on shore the big seals defend them and take\r\ncare of them so long as they keep at home. If they wander away, even\r\nthough they do not go out of sight, they pay no attention to them.\r\n\r\n“By the middle of September the homes are broken up and the seals\r\nreturn to the water to remain until May or June. Now, my Catherine,\r\nthat we have thus observed the seals in general, let us look after the\r\nmaking of your coat. The fur came neither from a big male seal, a baby\r\nseal, nor a mother seal. Then from what seal did it come?\r\n\r\n“Let us, on a July day, turn our eyes from the crowded rookeries, or\r\nseal homes on the rocks, and at some distance off on the shore we\r\nshall see thousands of other seals which the Indians call ‘bachelors.’\r\nThese are seals from two to six years old, young males fresh from the\r\nwater, but not allowed by the big adult seals to approach the homes\r\non the rocks. They do not seem troubled by the decree of exile; they\r\nare in good temper and high spirits, and they have very jolly times\r\nat play. They roll and tumble and gambol as do kittens and puppies.\r\nThey lie on the grass, shut their eyes, and roll to and fro; they sit\r\nand fan themselves; they stretch out and gently comb themselves with\r\nthe nails on their hind flippers; they take naps; they run races; they\r\nplay leap-frog over each others’ backs, and snort and roar with great\r\nhilarity.\r\n\r\n“These young seals have the long, coarse over-hair, less gray than the\r\nbig seals, and the soft, rich under-coat is silken and of a delicate\r\nbrown color. The down and feathers on a duck’s breast are arranged much\r\nas the hair and fur on a seal. In August seals begin to shed and renew\r\ntheir coats: in June and July they are at their best. These, then, are\r\nthe seals from which the skins for commerce are to be taken, and in\r\nJune and July it must be done. They are so docile and gentle that it is\r\nvery easy to kill them.\r\n\r\n“The seal-killers are Indian natives of the islands who understand\r\ntheir work. A number of these natives go to a herd of bachelors,\r\nand passing around them just at daybreak ‘cut out’ from one to two\r\nthousand, just as a shepherd ‘cuts out’ a drove of sheep from a great\r\nflock. Surrounding and gently driving them, they turn them to the\r\nslaughter-houses. Seals walk easily and quickly, and they go as they\r\nare driven with the docility of sheep. Arrived at the houses, they are\r\nallowed to lie down and rest and cool for half an hour.\r\n\r\n“Then an expert man goes out with several others armed with clubs. The\r\nexpert points to different seals and says: ‘Don’t kill him, he is too\r\nyoung.’ ‘Don’t kill that one, he is shedding his coat.’ ‘Don’t kill\r\nthat one, he is too old.’ ‘Let that one go, he is sick.’ And so on.\r\nWhen he has thus pointed out the exceptions, the men with the clubs\r\nlift the clubs high and bring down a crashing blow on the skull of each\r\nseal, killing it instantly. As the seal is killed it is dragged from\r\nthe group, laid on its back, and bled at once. If this is not done\r\nimmediately the body heats very soon and the fur falls off.\r\n\r\n“Then expert skinners strip off the skin, making cuts around the snout,\r\ntail, and flippers. Next the skins are carried to the salt-house, piled\r\non each other in bins, ‘fur to fat,’ in layers like piles of paper;\r\nsalt is thickly strewn on them, and they are held in place by heavy\r\nplanks. In two or three weeks they are taken out, rolled in bundles,\r\ntwo skins together, corded tightly, and shipped to London to be\r\ndressed. Now, my Catherine, we must leave the Pribylov Islands, and go\r\nto London to follow the fortunes of your seal-skin coat.[84]\r\n\r\n“In the seal-skin dressing establishment the skins are carefully heated\r\nto loosen the coarse hair and not disturb the fur; then the hair is\r\nvery carefully combed out, leaving the soft, silky fur, which is at\r\nonce dyed to a rich, even brown color. The difference in the price of\r\nseal-skin garments arises chiefly from the greater or less labor and\r\nskill expended in combing and dyeing them.\r\n\r\n“The process of preparing the skins is this: they are stretched on\r\nframes or beams, and the flesh side is well scraped; the skins are\r\nnext washed to remove grease, and are then dried, tacked on frames to\r\nkeep them smooth. When dry they are again soaked and well cleaned with\r\nsoap and water. Next the skin is dried by heat, and while still warm\r\nthe coarse hair is combed out, the skin being kept warm and pliable,\r\nso that the hairs will not break. Once more being dried, the surface\r\nof the fur is shaved evenly. Then the skins are made soft by a fulling\r\nmill, or by being covered with sawdust and then trodden upon until\r\npliable.\r\n\r\n“After all this the skins are examined, mended where torn, and two\r\nskins are laid together fur to fur, with paper fastened between. In\r\nthis way they are shipped to the United States. It requires three\r\nskins to make your coat, my Catherine; if the style demanded very\r\nlong coats it would require five. Being safely at the furriers in the\r\nUnited States, the skins are cut into coats and muffs and collars of\r\nthe latest fashion, beautifully lined with quilted silk, and you, my\r\nCatherine, walk forth defiant of the cold, clad in the soft, warm\r\ngarments which a year ago were swimming, rolling, plunging, feeding,\r\nsleeping in Bering Sea.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82] See U.

These are not the only mammals that live\r\nin the sea; the sea-lion, porpoise, dolphin, and others are also\r\nsea-mammals. In a book like this we cannot discuss all the animals of\r\nany large order, and now we turn from these huge citizens of the sea,\r\nto learn something about a small but equally curious flying mammal,\r\na citizen of the air,--the bat. It is a little beast, universally\r\ndisliked, even feared; let us hope to clear away some of the foolish\r\nnotions which surround it, and place it where it belongs, among\r\nharmless and interesting animals.\r\n\r\nOne evening last summer, as we sat on the veranda, a dark, winged\r\ncreature with an uncertain, zigzag flight swept above us. “Oh! Oh! the\r\nhorrible thing,” screamed Mabel, putting her hands to her head; “he\r\nwill get tangled up in my hair. Bats always do that.”\r\n\r\n“Mabel,” I said, “I don’t think you ever saw a person in whose hair a\r\nbat had become tangled. I never did. It would be as unusual an incident\r\nas to find that a toad had hopped into your pocket.”\r\n\r\nA few minutes after we saw in the moonlight, on the gravel walk, a\r\nsmall, dark object, moving in the most clumsy, hobbling fashion. “It is\r\nthat bat,” shouted Rex. “Where is a stick? Let me kill him.”\r\n\r\n“Let him be,” I said. “I can tell you some very delightful things about\r\nhim.” In fact, I told Rex such wonders that he became interested in\r\nbats, and happening the next day to find a young, half-grown bat in\r\nthe smoke-house, he concluded to take it to school, to ask for further\r\ninformation from his teacher. To do this, he put it in a pasteboard\r\nbox, with the cover left partly off to give the creature air. The\r\nlittle bat cried, and the mother bat came flying in haste to her child.\r\nAs she could not get into the box to her baby, she clung to the outside\r\nwith her head to the opening, making little encouraging squeaks; and\r\nthus Rex actually carried both bats to school. The teacher put them\r\ninto a small cage, and fed them bread, milk, and sugar for several\r\ndays; then one evening they were set free.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what Rex learned about bats. The bat has a number of\r\nnames; the English peasants call it a “flitter-mouse,” from its jerky,\r\nuneven flight. The Germans and Dutch give it the same name; the Swedes\r\ncall it a “leather-mouse,” from its parchment-like wings; Goldsmith\r\nused to call it “a mouse with wings.”\r\n\r\nThe bat is a four-legged, hairy creature, with teeth set in sockets in\r\nthe jaws; it suckles its young; in addition to these characteristics\r\nof a mammal, it has wings and truly flies. Were it not for the wings\r\nit would have been put in the order of insect-eaters, but its wings\r\nhave secured for it an order for itself. The name of this order is the\r\n“wing-handed,” or “hand winged,” and to it belong the bats, vampires,\r\nand flying foxes, all of them truly bats, under varied names.\r\n\r\nThe lemurs, flying squirrels, and a few other animals have extensions\r\nof the skin mantle-wise along the body and legs, to bear them up for a\r\nlittle in the air, as they make long leaps; but they do not really fly.\r\nThe bat, on the contrary, has good wings, and flies. The bat reminds\r\nus a little of that winged reptile which was in the ancient world long\r\nbefore men appeared on the earth. That was a reptile with a large,\r\nskin-like wing; a bat is a mammal with two skin-covered wings.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the bat’s wing is very different from that of a\r\nbird.[85] The bones and muscles of a bird’s wing are set with stiff\r\nfeathers, which can be folded together as a fan is furled. When spread\r\nthey form an elastic instrument for beating the air, and sending the\r\nbird forward, upward, downward, wherever it may choose to direct its\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nThe body and head of the common bat are very like those of a mouse; it\r\nhas bright black eyes, a mouth full of tiny white teeth, a covering of\r\ngray or reddish hair over all its body. A mouse has a long, scaly tail;\r\na bat has a very short tail; the ears of a mouse are small and pointed;\r\nthe bat’s ears are large. The nostrils have a fold or ruffle of skin\r\nabout them, which is supposed to improve the sense of smell.\r\n\r\nThe fore legs, or rather the arms, are very wonderful. If we had the\r\nskeleton of a bat we should see that the bones of the arm and forearm\r\nare long and slender, and instead of two bones in the lower part or\r\nforearm, there is but one which represents the smaller bone in the\r\nhuman arm. The bat’s hand has five distinct fingers. The first of them,\r\nthe thumb, is short, but the other four are very long, much longer\r\nthan all the rest of the bat, and they are also very slim. Upon these\r\nfingers, as upon a frame, the thin, leather-like double membrane of\r\nthe wing is stretched on each side of the extended hand, enclosing the\r\nfinger-bones, thus the two arms have become a pair of wings.\r\n\r\nThis membrane is extended from the fingers to the sides of the body,\r\nthen passes back to the hind legs, and covers them up to the ankles,\r\nand so round enclosing the little tail. Thus the bat has an enormous\r\nspread of wing for its size. The long forefinger of the hand extends\r\nto the tip of the wing, and the middle finger runs close to it, making\r\nthis part of the wing strong. When the bat closes its wings the bony\r\nframe shuts together like the wires of an umbrella, and the skin hangs\r\nin folds as the covering of the umbrella hangs in folds between the\r\nclosed wires. The thumb of the bat’s hand is left free, and the nail is\r\na large, hooked claw.\r\n\r\nThe flight of a bat is strong and tireless, but it is not in straight\r\nlines, nor in easy curves or sweeps like that of a bird; it is restless\r\nand flitting, with sharp turns and jerky motions.\r\n\r\nWhen the bat alights on the ground, as it but seldom does, it shows\r\nitself a genuine quadruped. It draws its fingers together, throwing\r\nthe membrane of the wing into folds, and so the free, strongly clawed\r\nthumb projects, and on this claw, and the hind feet which are free to\r\nthe ankles, the bat walks, but as you might expect, its gait is very\r\nawkward.\r\n\r\nThe bat is a night-flying creature. Its sight is better suited for\r\nnight than daylight; it prefers twilight, or dark caverns. Like the owl\r\nand the moth it sleeps by day, and comes out after sunset. As it eats\r\ninsects it frequents shady places where insects can be found; during\r\nthe day it rests in cool, dark places where there is some rough surface\r\nto which it can cling. Thus, dark woods, hollow trees, old barns,\r\nabandoned houses, church towers, and caves are the choice haunts of the\r\nbat.\r\n\r\nFrom its habit of hiding, its night-flying, its uncouth motion, its\r\nmouse-like body and unfeathered wings, which are so unhandsome that\r\nartists have copied them when they wish to show demons, witches,\r\ndragons, harpies, and evil angels with wings, the poor bat has\r\nderived its unlucky reputation, and the general dislike with which\r\nit is regarded. In truth, there is scarcely any creature so frail,\r\ndefenceless, harmless, friendly, gentle, and timid as a bat. It has\r\nno weapons, and its only hope of defence lies in its quick, erratic\r\nflight.[86]\r\n\r\nDuring the day in its dark shelter, the bat sleeps in a strange\r\nfashion. It hangs itself up on some projecting stone or twig, as you\r\nwould hang a cloak on a peg, or an umbrella by the crook on the handle.\r\nIt hangs head down, using the large hooked claws on the hind-feet to\r\ncling by, and queer as the position is, it seems to suit very well.\r\nBats are social in nature, and live in large flocks or bands. A cave\r\nor tower may have its walls quite covered with them, hanging close\r\ntogether. Sometimes, especially in winter, they cling one to the other\r\nin a curious, compact mass.\r\n\r\nBats hibernate, or sleep, through cold weather, hiding themselves in\r\ntree-caves or other dark places early in the autumn, and coming forth\r\nwhen the spring is fully opened and has brought their insect food. When\r\nthe bat goes abroad it spends all its time in hunting for insects. Our\r\ncommon bat is a most useful creature, destroying thousands of insects\r\nwhich would be harmful to our garden and fruit trees. In a season,\r\na bat eats myriads of gnats, midges, moths, beetles, cockroaches,\r\ncrickets, and grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nThe great bat, or noctule,[87] has a spread of wing of twelve or\r\nfourteen inches, while its body is only three inches long. Its mouth\r\ncan open with a wide gap like that of a swallow. When it catches a\r\nbeetle, it has to hold it to its mouth by its thumb claw while it eats\r\nit, as a boy would eat a pear. To bring the thumb around to its mouth\r\nthe bat must partly close the wing; as it does this it drops a foot or\r\nso; then it gives a stroke or two of its wings as it chews the bite it\r\nhas taken, and rises again; then it takes another bite of beetle, and\r\nso on. All the time it is hunting it gives shrill squeaks or cries.\r\n\r\nNot only is the free thumb of the bat’s hand useful for holding food,\r\nbut it is of great service in walking, as its method is to extend the\r\narm, catch hold of the ground by the claw of one free thumb, and pull\r\nitself forward; then make the same motion with the other arm and thumb,\r\nthe free feet following these movements. Thus it proceeds in a zigzag,\r\nmoving first to one side and then to the other. Although this is such\r\nan awkward method of progress the bat can run rapidly.\r\n\r\nBats are not great travellers; they haunt the same locality year after\r\nyear. The mother bat has seldom more than one young one at a time, and\r\nthis is born early in the spring, before the bats begin to fly abroad.\r\nThe baby bat is smaller than a small bean, is blind and hairless. The\r\nmother bat folds up a part of her wing membrane into a cradle or nest\r\nfor this tiny creature; she seems very fond of it, smooths and brushes\r\nit, and keeps it warm and clean.\r\n\r\nThe little creature has from the first strong claws, and uses them\r\nto hold fast to its mother. For several weeks this little one clings\r\nto its mother, is fed by her milk, and when she goes out to hunt she\r\ncarries it along and never lets it fall. Even after a young bat can fly\r\nand catch insects for itself, it keeps near its mother, and she watches\r\nover it, and timid as she is by nature, she will die in its defence.\r\n\r\nBats are found in nearly all parts of the world, and may be divided\r\naccording to their food into insect-eating and fruit-eating bats. The\r\ninsect-eating bats belong generally to cold or mild climates, and the\r\nfruit-eaters to the tropics. The fruit-eating bats are much larger than\r\nthe insect-eaters, and they are destructive and troublesome, while the\r\ncommon bats are useful.\r\n\r\nThe four most famous bats are the common bat, which we have described;\r\nthe long-eared bat, which has ears so enormous that they are as long as\r\nthe creature’s entire body; the flying-fox, a bat of India, very lazy,\r\nand having a fox-like face. Flying-foxes are found in India, Africa,\r\nand the Oceanic Islands. In Java the fruit trees must be protected\r\nwith bamboo nettings, to prevent the depredations of these creatures.\r\nThe fourth notable bat is the vampire of Southern and Central America.\r\nThese are very large bats given to blood-sucking, and while their bites\r\nand blood-sucking do not occasion death, they are very troublesome to\r\nboth men and beasts.\r\n\r\nOne of the most wonderful things about the bat is its ability to guide\r\nitself in flying in perfectly dark places, and even when it is blind.\r\nA blind bat flies just as swiftly and safely as one with good eyes.\r\nIt seems that the sense of touch is remarkably acute, so that even\r\nwithout contact, they can tell when a solid body, even of small size,\r\nis near them. Although the bat does not seem to need its sight to\r\ndirect it in flying, its eyes are remarkably keen, as is shown by its\r\ninsect-catching. So the phrase “as blind as a bat” is a poor comparison.\r\n\r\nBats can be easily tamed and become very friendly, eating insects from\r\none’s hand, coming when called, perching on an extended finger, and\r\nseeming quite at home in a room. In captivity they eat insects, raw\r\nmeat, sugar, cake, and bread soaked in milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] Compare Nature Reader, No. 3, Lesson 28.\r\n\r\n[86] When alarmed by being caught and held, bats sometimes bite, but\r\nthe bite is not very severe.\r\n\r\n[87] Common in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVI.\r\n\r\nORDER OUT OF CONFUSION.\r\n\r\n    “O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies\r\n    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities,\r\n    For nought so vile that on this earth doth live,\r\n    But to the earth some special grace doth give.”\r\n\r\n                                        --SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now studied some of the mammals of the sea, and a family of\r\nmammals which spend a large part of their time on the wing. Let us\r\nlook next at a species which lives entirely underground,--the mole. In\r\ndescribing the mole-cricket[88] and the “duck-bill,” we noted certain\r\nresemblances between these creatures and the moles, taking it for\r\ngranted that moles, being common and widely distributed creatures, were\r\nwell known. But in point of fact, what do we know of the structure and\r\nhabits of this interesting little animal?\r\n\r\nThe mole is very nearly as unpopular as the bat. Gardeners complain\r\nbitterly that the moles destroy their lawns, by raising long furrows\r\nwhich disturb the grass, and that they ruin vegetables and cereal crops\r\nby eating the roots. I think the mole must plead guilty to the first\r\ncharge; it does injure the lawns by raising its unsightly furrows, but\r\nit does not eat roots or other vegetable food. It sometimes draws down\r\ninto the ground stalks of oats, wheat, or barley, to line its nest;\r\nit also serves some long-stemmed vegetable in the same way; it also\r\ncuts off the roots of vegetables, now and then, if it finds them in\r\nits way as it digs its underground galleries. But the food of a mole\r\nis animal--earth-worms, beetles, larvæ and pupæ of insects--and thus\r\nthe mole offsets its errors and turns the scale of opinion in its own\r\nfavor, by being exceedingly useful as a destroyer of insects harmful to\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nLooking out on my lawn one morning, I saw that it was badly marred by\r\nmole ridges. Tom, the gardener, went over them with the roller, but the\r\nnext day they were as bad as ever. “Tom,” I said, “you must catch that\r\nmole.” That afternoon Tom came into the library, carrying something\r\nwhich looked like a pretty fur purse, held by a short cord.\r\n\r\n“I’ve caught him,” he said, “and as you like such things, I have\r\nbrought him in alive.” So the pretty drab purse was the mole. Alive!\r\nHe did not look it. Alarmed at his situation, as Tom carried him by\r\nhis short, nearly bare tail, the little beast had drawn his head,\r\nhands, and feet closely into his soft, silky coat, and exhibited only a\r\nrigid, fur-covered cylinder. I watched him a few moments, Tom keeping\r\nperfectly still, and presently I saw a little red nose and a pair of\r\npink hands stretched out from the fur, as if feeling for something\r\nto take hold of. Tom laid his prize on my table, and I proceeded to\r\nexamine him, as we shall now do.\r\n\r\nThe common mole, which claims the short and pretty name of _talpa_,\r\nhas a cylindrical body about six inches long and three inches thick.\r\nThere is no apparent neck. The head tapers quickly off from the line\r\nof the shoulders to a little snout of the shape of the tip of a blunt\r\nlead-pencil. This snout is about a quarter of an inch long, flexible,\r\nof a deep red, tough skin. Under this snout is the mouth, which is\r\nvery wide and furnished with twenty-two sharp white teeth on each jaw.\r\nThe two upper and two lower front teeth are long and lap over; the\r\nothers are smaller and pointed.\r\n\r\nOnce people said that the mole had no eyes, and needed none, as it\r\nlived in the dark underground. But it has two very small, jet black\r\neyes, deeply hidden in its lovely thick fur and covered by a fold of\r\nskin. The nostrils and ears of the mole are almost as closely hidden,\r\nbut internally well developed. We may say then that the creature has\r\nsight, somewhat limited and imperfect, but sense of hearing and smell\r\nvery keen. We can see how wise it is that these delicate organs, the\r\neyes, ears, and nostrils, should be well protected by the thick fur, as\r\nthe mole burrows underground.\r\n\r\nThe body of the mole is entirely covered with soft, close, even, fine\r\nfur of a deep drab or mouse color, nearly black. No lady dressed in\r\nplush was ever more richly arrayed than this little burrower. The tail\r\nis short and scantily covered with hair; the legs are very short and\r\nstrong, and set close to the body. The fore limbs or arms are furnished\r\nwith broad, flat, five-fingered hands, set with the palms turned\r\noutward, so that as the mole digs, it throws the earth to the right and\r\nleft. The palms of these hands are very singular; they are somewhat\r\ncallous, of a rose pink, and the fingers are webbed up to the strong,\r\ncurved nails.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal is removed from the earth the snout and palms soon\r\nbecome peculiarly dry, and this evidently causes pain and irritation.\r\nThe hind-feet are only about one-quarter the size of the hands. They\r\nare webbed, but are not so strong, and have more slender nails.\r\nThe broad front feet, or hands, fitted for digging, indicate the\r\nunderground life of the mole; the webbing of the hands and feet\r\nsuggest, what we find to be true, that the mole is a good swimmer.\r\nIndeed, it often goes from the mainland to islands in lakes, rivers, or\r\nponds to dig out its home.\r\n\r\nWet or stony land does not suit the mole, because it cannot dig its\r\nrooms and galleries in such soil. Fertile fields that have been\r\ncultivated and loosened by spade and plough are its favorite haunts. It\r\nis very wonderful that such a small, soft creature can move and disturb\r\nso much earth.\r\n\r\nEvery mole lives alone and builds for itself an elaborate and\r\ncomfortable home. This house consists of a central dome, where the\r\nearth is well packed and beaten to prevent the percolation of water. A\r\nbed made of leaves, grass, and vegetable stems is placed in this room.\r\nAround this dome wind and radiate seven or eight long galleries or\r\ntunnels, which break off and pass into each other in a curious fashion,\r\nso that there is no direct line of approach to the dome. It is evident\r\nthat this labyrinth of galleries is designed to make the dome safe from\r\nintruders, and to enable the mole to elude pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe mother mole has from four to six little ones at a litter, and she\r\nhas two litters each year, one in April and one in August. Thus we see\r\nthat moles multiply rapidly. The mother mole is very careful of her\r\nchildren. The large domed room is their nursery, and she makes them a\r\nsoft bed. The little moles grow quickly, and in a few weeks are weaned,\r\nas they have become able to feed themselves. When they leave their\r\nnursery the digging instinct develops in them, and they at once set\r\nabout making a dome and galleries, and going to housekeeping each one\r\nfor itself.\r\n\r\nWhile the fur of the mole is exceedingly pretty the skin is so small\r\nand delicate that very little use can be made of it, though sometimes\r\nit is used for gloves, purses, bags, caps, and mittens. In England,\r\nwhere moles abound, men called “mole-catchers” go about with spades and\r\ntraps and catch and kill the moles.\r\n\r\nThe mole is the most hungry and ravenous in proportion to its size and\r\nweakness of all mammals. Hunger seems to be a madness with it. Moles\r\neat snails and are very partial to frogs, but oddly enough they will\r\nnot touch toads. A mole will eat the dead body of a bird, mouse, or\r\nsmall snake, if it finds these in its rambles. If two moles are shut up\r\ntogether without food one will kill and devour the other. Moles drink\r\nvery freely.\r\n\r\nThese creatures seldom appear at the surface of the ground. Now and\r\nthen they will come out of their galleries by night, but strong light\r\nis painful to them.\r\n\r\nExcept for attacking each other when imprisoned and very hungry, moles\r\nare quiet and gentle in disposition. No creature, however, is harder to\r\ntame and keep in captivity, not because of any violence or uneasiness\r\nof disposition, but because of its dislike for daylight, and its need\r\nof darkness, coolness, and the slight moisture of the earth below the\r\nsurface. A mole shut up in a room or box seems seized with a terrible\r\nhomesickness for its underground haunts, pines away, and soon dies.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that a mole will die if left without food for ten\r\nor twelve hours, and that moles eat only animal food, refusing all\r\nvegetable substances. Though individual moles may have been found of\r\nwhich this is true, the statements are incorrect as applied to _all_\r\nmoles. The mole which Tom brought me, I put into a thick pasteboard box\r\nwith some air-holes cut in the cover. I put in the box a little flat\r\npan of water, and Tom insisted upon giving the animal some grains of\r\ncorn and wheat. The mole did not touch these grains, but drank some\r\nwater. After it had fasted sixteen hours, I gave it boiled rice, which\r\nit refused. In two hours more I gave it bread soaked in milk, and of\r\nthat it ate a little.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty-four hours of captivity, I gave it cracked oats, uncooked,\r\nbut soaked in milk. This it ate heartily. After it had been thirty-six\r\nhours in the box, I let it out in the room, and it at once ran about\r\nlooking for some place to dig. I threw a large woollen mitten on the\r\nfloor, and that it soon found, crept into it, thrust its head into\r\nthe thumb, and remained quiet for some hours. I kept it for several\r\ndays, during which time it drank water, ate oats soaked in milk, and\r\nalso took a little raw meat. It pulled and tore at the carpet and\r\nupholstery, seeking for places to burrow, but remained for the most of\r\nthe time in the mitten.\r\n\r\nA mole’s skeleton is a nice curiosity for a museum, and is easily\r\nprepared. A mole can be quickly and painlessly killed by a sharp blow\r\njust back of the head. After it is skinned, lay the carcass near a\r\nlarge hill of ants, or at the edge of a pond, where there are plenty\r\nof tadpoles, and soon only the clean white skeleton will remain. Wash\r\nthis in hot water and ammonia, and dry it in the sun; then mount it\r\ncarefully on a little board covered with black, which will set the\r\nsmall white bones in good relief.\r\n\r\nThese studies of swimming, flying, and burrowing mammals suggest to us\r\nthe diversity which exists in the great class of mammalian animals.\r\nOn the ground, and under the ground, in the water, in the air, on the\r\ntrees, we find the mammals, and at first it might seem impossible to\r\nbring order out of this confusion, and divide these almost innumerable\r\ncreatures into their proper groups. But a careful study of these varied\r\nforms has enabled scientists to divide them according to their most\r\npeculiar characteristics, putting orders, sub-orders, and families\r\ntogether according to their closest relationships. So, when we study\r\nthese animals, we are able to decide upon their names and places in the\r\nclass mammalia. And like all else that is orderly, this classification\r\nbecomes presently clear and simple.\r\n\r\nLet us now set the various divisions of the vertebrate animals in a\r\ntable which can be easily understood, and will be found convenient for\r\nreference. The vertebrate or backboned animals are divided into--\r\n\r\n  Fishes,\r\n  Amphibians,\r\n  Reptiles,\r\n  Birds,\r\n  Mammals.\r\n\r\nThe mammals are divided into various orders beginning with the\r\nmonotremes, the lowest form of mammalian life, and closing with man,\r\nthe highest form. So our table stands--\r\n\r\n  Monotremes: duck-bill, echidna.\r\n\r\n  Marsupials: having a pouch for the young--kangaroo, opossum.\r\n\r\n  Edentata: having no teeth on the front of the jaw; sloth, etc.\r\n\r\n  Cetacea: fish-like creatures, eating animal food--whales, dolphins.\r\n\r\n  Sirenia: fish-like creatures eating vegetable food.\r\n\r\n  Insect-eaters: mole, hedge-hog, etc.\r\n\r\n  Hand-winged creatures: the bats and vampires.\r\n\r\n  Rodents, or gnawers: with chisel-like front teeth; rats, beavers, etc.\r\n\r\n  Ungulates or hoofed  {even-toed; as cow, sheep, deer, etc.\r\n                       {uneven-toed; as hog, horse, elephant, etc.\r\n\r\n  Carnivora or flesh-eaters  {seals, sea-lions.\r\n                             {dogs, cats, bears, lions, foxes, tigers,\r\n                              etc.\r\n\r\n  Primates  {Quadrumana, or four-handed, as apes and monkeys.\r\n            {Homo (man).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] See Nature Reader, No. 3, p. 123.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVII.\r\n\r\nA REMARKABLE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n    “He prayeth best who loveth best\r\n      All things both great and small,\r\n    For the dear God who loveth us\r\n      He made and loveth all.”\r\n\r\n                   --S. T. COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our last lesson we enumerated the orders into which the mammalian\r\nclass has been divided. Of six of these orders we have already studied\r\nrepresentatives. We have found in the duck-bill and two other animals,\r\nthe only species of the order of monotremes; the opossum and kangaroo\r\nfurnished us examples of the pouched animals. The third order mentioned\r\nis that of the edentata, or tooth-lacking creatures, and some of its\r\nfamilies we will now discuss.\r\n\r\nThe name toothless is only partly descriptive of this group of mammals,\r\nbecause while some of them are really without any teeth, there are\r\nothers that have the enormous number of ninety-eight. But all of the\r\nedentata are destitute of any teeth on the front of the jaws; there is\r\nalways a vacant space there; and besides this, all the teeth are more\r\nor less imperfect, and have only one root. That vacant space in the\r\nfront of the jaws, and the peculiarity of all the teeth being exactly\r\nalike, are constant characteristics of the edentata.\r\n\r\nAll of these animals are slow and clumsy in their movements, show\r\nvery little intelligence, and have sharp, strong claws on all their\r\ntoes. They are all natives of warm countries, and are most numerous\r\nin South America. None of the living edentata are more than four\r\nfeet long including the tail, and some are no larger than rats. But\r\nfrom rocks and shell-beds, deep in the earth, have been taken fossil\r\nremains of this family, showing creatures which lived far back in the\r\nearly periods of earth-building, some of them as large as an ox, or a\r\nrhinoceros, or an elephant.\r\n\r\nThe first of the edentata which we shall examine is called the sloth.\r\nIt is a South American animal, and was for a long time classed among\r\nthe monkeys, on account of its tree-climbing habits, and the long hair\r\nwhich covers its body. On the ground, to which it seldom descends, the\r\nsloth is the most ungainly of beasts. Its hind legs are very short, and\r\nits arms or fore legs are very long; its claws are strong and curved,\r\nand the toes are buried in the skin up to the nails, so that they can\r\nmake no separate movements. Their leg joints turn outwards, and when\r\nthe creatures try to walk on the ground, they are compelled to double\r\nup their fore legs and go on their knees. Moreover, these sloths cannot\r\nbear strong light. When placed on the earth in the sunshine they seem\r\nto be crippled and blind.\r\n\r\nThe sloth has no tail, and no external ears. The eyes are small and\r\nsleepy; the motions of the creature are slow; its intelligence is very\r\nlimited; in length it is about thirty inches, and the body has the\r\ngeneral proportions of a monkey. Is this beast, then, a poor deformity?\r\nOr, in the noble plan of nature, is there some place which it exactly\r\nfits and fills? Let us see.\r\n\r\nNow we shall place this queer little animal on its native trees. At\r\nonce all is changed. Why, this sloth is all grace! You could not see\r\na more beautiful climber. The short hind legs, crooked claws, long\r\nforearms, are just suited to tree life, for clambering safely and\r\nlightly from bough to bough. The sloth, thanks to its claws, is as safe\r\nhanging back downwards as a bird is safe in its nest. Those weak eyes\r\nare suited to the soft shadows of the leaves; the subdued light on the\r\ntree is just right for it.\r\n\r\nThe sloth is a vegetable feeder; as it climbs about the tree it nibbles\r\noff the sap leaves and the delicate new bark and twigs; hanging by the\r\nfeet and one hand, it reaches out the other long arm, and picks fruit\r\nas dexterously as any school-boy; then holding the fruit to its mouth\r\nit eats it daintily. In museums or zoological gardens the sloths are\r\nfurnished with a tree to climb upon, and are fed on fruit, vegetables,\r\nand bread and milk.\r\n\r\nThe next of the edentata which we shall observe is the armadillo, one\r\nof the most singular of animals. At first sight you would feel sure it\r\nwas not a mammal, but a reptile of the lizard or turtle family, for\r\ninstead of being covered with hair or fur, it wears a heavy case or\r\narmor of large scales. These scales, or bony plates, are arranged in\r\nclose bands about the body. The plates over the head, neck, and tail\r\nare immovable, but those on the centre of the back will lap, so that\r\nthe creature can roll itself into a ball, bringing the nose, feet, and\r\nall parts of the body under protection of its horny armor. The under\r\npart of the body has no scales, but is covered with hair.\r\n\r\nThe armadillo has short legs with five-toed feet, each toe being\r\nfurnished with a strong claw. The ears are very large; the eyes are\r\nsmall; the nostrils are set at the end of the long, pointed snout. The\r\nsmallest of the species is about the size of a rat; the great armadillo\r\nis a yard long, and has in its widely opening mouth ninety-eight teeth.\r\n\r\nInstead of living on trees like the sloth, it burrows in the ground;\r\nthe rooms and galleries which they fashion for themselves are like\r\nthose of the mole, only larger. The strong, curved claws are used to\r\ntear up the ground, and they do this so effectually that the animal\r\nwill disappear beneath the surface in a very short time.\r\n\r\nWhen undisturbed, the movement of the armadillo is a slow, a dignified\r\nmarch, suited to its short legs and heavy armor. When pursued, if it\r\ndoes not have opportunity to dig a burrow, it can run, and has been\r\nknown to outstrip a man in a race. When attacked the creature prefers\r\nto tear up the earth and sink away out of sight; if it cannot do this,\r\nit rolls itself into a ball, and trusts to its armor.\r\n\r\nAs it paces about, it feeds daintily on vegetables and fruit; it\r\nwaits under trees for the fruit to fall, and then nibbles at it very\r\ncontentedly. Still it does not reject animal substances, not even\r\ncarrion, for when it discovers a decaying carcass it feeds upon it; it\r\nalso devours insects whenever it can get them.\r\n\r\nA third curious specimen of this order is the ant-bear, which is\r\nchiefly found in Brazil and Guiana, but is not unknown in the other\r\nparts of South America. The ant-eater or “ant-bear” is sometimes a\r\nyard and a half long not including the tail. The most conspicuous part\r\nof this creature is its tail, which is plume-like, and carried over\r\nits back like that of a gray squirrel, but is very large, so that it\r\novershadows most of the body, like a great canopy of fine, loose,\r\nwaving hairs. The body is covered with long, coarse, dark hair; the\r\nlegs are long and very strong, and the claws are deeply hooked and\r\nsingularly powerful.\r\n\r\nThe ant-bear’s head is small, and tapers from the neck to a long,\r\ncurved snout, at the end of which are the nostrils. The ears are small\r\nand placed far back on the head; the eyes are small and set half-way\r\ndown the snout. This snout is well worth looking at; it is really a\r\ntube, with a small, round hole at the tip, through which the ant-eater\r\ncan thrust out his tongue. The tongue is long, slim, round, worm-like,\r\nand covered with a sticky secretion. The ant-bear has no teeth.\r\n\r\nThe chief food of this odd animal is ants, and let us see its method of\r\nfeasting. During the day, while ants work abroad, this animal sleeps;\r\nbut it wanders out at night when the ants are in their hills. The\r\nant-eater puts his long snout into a hill, and thrusting his sticky\r\ntongue into the rooms and galleries, gathers upon it ants and pupæ.\r\nThen he draws his tongue into the tube, swallows his prey, and repeats\r\nthe performance. In like fashion the ant-eater will capture upon his\r\nslimy tongue other small insects.\r\n\r\nThis animal is mild in disposition, slow and listless in its motions.\r\nIt prefers damp forests, or reedy marshes, for its home. Though quiet,\r\nit is not timid, and if attacked by a fox, wild-cat, or jaguar, it will\r\ndefend itself, and often squeeze the enemy to death, or tear it to\r\npieces with its powerful claws.\r\n\r\nOwing to its lack of teeth and its tube-shaped mouth, it is evident\r\nthat the ant-eater cannot chew food, but in addition to swallowing\r\ninsects whole, it can take food by sucking the juices, as beetles\r\nand some other insects do. In the London Zoological Gardens were two\r\nant-eaters, which not only ate insects when they could get them, but\r\nsucked up raw eggs and bread and milk, and would also suck the blood\r\nfrom raw meat.\r\n\r\nThe mother ant-eater is a fond and attentive parent. She has but one\r\nlittle one at a time, and she carries it about seated on her back. She\r\nnever leaves it for a moment.\r\n\r\nThere is one variety of the ant-eater which lives on trees. This\r\nanimal seldom comes to the ground; it eats fruit and the insects which\r\nfrequent trees, and drinks the dew and rain from the leaves. It is\r\na pretty creature of about the size of a small squirrel. This tree\r\nant-eater does not carry her baby about on her back; instead, she\r\nfinds a hole in the tree where she makes a nest of leaves, and there\r\nshe puts her child to sleep while she hunts about for food. Every few\r\nminutes she returns and puts her little head into the hole to see how\r\nher baby is coming on.\r\n\r\nIn India, China, Java, and the Malay Islands, there is one of the\r\nedentata called a pangolin, which wears an extraordinary coat, from\r\nwhich it is sometimes called “the scaly lizard.” This coat is composed\r\nof large, leaf-like, pointed scales, set in the skin much in the\r\nfashion of the nails on your fingers. These scales lap over each other\r\nlike roofing-slates, and extend from the nose to the tip of the tail. A\r\nstrip on the under side of the body is bare of scales.\r\n\r\nLike the armadillo, the pangolin can roll itself into a ball if it is\r\nin danger. Also like the armadillo, the pangolins have short, strong\r\nlegs, strong, curved claws, and dig burrows. But they are not so fond\r\nof burrowing as the armadillo, and if they find a hollow in a tree\r\nthey take that for a home. While the armadillos are short and thick in\r\nbody, and much like a tortoise in shape, the pangolins are slender and\r\nlizard-like.\r\n\r\nThe pangolin has no trace of teeth, and its method of feeding is like\r\nthat of the ant-bear. The head is short and the tongue less slim than\r\nthe ant-bear’s, but the manner of procuring food is the same. It has\r\nthe largest and brightest eyes of all its order. There is no external\r\near, but hidden under the scales on the head there is an ear opening.\r\n\r\nWhen the pangolin wishes to defend itself, it can erect its scales as\r\nthe porcupine does its quills, and so it looks very fierce. All the\r\nmotions of the pangolin are slow except the play of its tongue, which\r\ndarts in and out with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of these animals we see, that while the edentata differ\r\nremarkably in many respects, they are alike in these particulars: There\r\nare no teeth on the front of the jaws; their toes have strong claws;\r\ntheir motions are very slow; their intelligence is small; they are\r\ninhabitants of South America or the eastern part of Asia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE GNAWERS.[89]\r\n\r\n    “And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling,\r\n    And out of the homes the rats came tumbling:\r\n    Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,\r\n    Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,\r\n    Grave old plodders, gay young friskers,\r\n    Cocking tails and pricking whiskers!”\r\n\r\n                      --R. BROWNING, _Pied Piper_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our chapter on the whales we have given examples of the fourth\r\nin our list of the mammalian orders. The manatee stood as the\r\nrepresentative of the next named order, that of the sirenia. Then came\r\nthe order of the insect-eaters, or insectivora, and little Mr. Talpa,\r\nthe mole, was described, though perhaps he is not more interesting than\r\nhis relations, the shrews and the hedgehogs. The seventh order in our\r\nlist is that of the wing-handed creatures, which is occupied entirely\r\nby the bats, with their first cousins, the vampires and flying foxes.\r\nThese animals might have been set with the edentata, if they had not\r\nindulged in the peculiarity of wings.\r\n\r\nOur eighth order is the rodentia, or gnawers. No order of animals is\r\nbetter known, or has more common examples. Hark! in the stillness of\r\nthe house at night you may hear a rush and a scuttle through the walls,\r\nor a fine nibble in a corner; these sounds proclaim the presence of two\r\nvery unpopular rodents, the rat and the mouse.\r\n\r\nAs I was sitting one day last summer in the shelter of a great rock, a\r\nlittle animal appeared from a maple wood some hundred yards distant,\r\nand with long hops came over the hillside towards me. When about thirty\r\nyards from me, he stopped--he had just discovered me. This was our most\r\nbeautiful rodent, the large gray squirrel. I concluded that bright\r\nas his eyes are he could not see so far as I could, or he would have\r\nnoticed me when he came out of the wood. A little while after, as I\r\nstill sat silent and motionless, another beautiful rodent came from an\r\nadjacent tree, and, deceived by my stillness and the color of my linen\r\ngown, he came and sat down on the hem of the gown, and holding himself\r\nerect on his haunches began to eat a nut. This last was the pretty\r\nchipmunk, wearing a reddish coat, and having black velvet stripes down\r\nhis back.\r\n\r\nIn introducing these four animals, I have already indicated the\r\ncreatures to be found in the order of rodents, or gnawers. One of its\r\nmost famous and ancient members, the beaver, we have already described\r\nin a chapter by himself. The order of gnawers is one of the most\r\nextensive of the mammalian class. All of its members are small, or\r\nof moderate size. They are distinguished by having only two kinds of\r\nteeth, incisors, or cutting teeth, and molars, or grinding teeth.\r\n\r\nThe incisors, generally two or four on the front of each jaw, are long,\r\nstout, and curved. They are covered with enamel on the front only, and\r\nso the back part of the tooth wears away faster than the front part,\r\nand thus constantly preserves a sharp, knife-like edge, which is as\r\nserviceable as the best tempered chisel in cutting any kind of wood.\r\nThe incisors never wear out. They grow from the base just as fast as\r\nthey wear off at the tip.\r\n\r\nThe rodents are furry, four-legged animals, with nails or claws upon\r\ntheir toes. They have large bright eyes, sharp, well-set ears, and\r\nall their senses are very acute. They are also distinguished for\r\nintelligence, and generally for amiable dispositions. Among them are to\r\nbe found the rat, mouse, squirrel, rabbit, hare, musk-rat, dormouse,\r\njerboa, chinchilla, porcupine, ground pig, marmot, and many others. The\r\nporcupine and his family offer an exception to the other rodents in\r\nwearing quills among the fur.\r\n\r\nThe rodents differ widely in their homes; some, as the squirrels, live\r\nin trees; others in forms or lairs on the ground, as rabbits and hares;\r\nsome, as the beaver and musk-rat, are chiefly aquatic. The rodents\r\nalso differ in their mode of life. The squirrels, rabbits, hares,[90]\r\nand some of the mice, work and eat by day and sleep at night; others,\r\nas the rats, guinea-pigs, and porcupines, are principally nocturnal\r\nanimals, coming forth from their homes about sunset.\r\n\r\nIn general the rodents feed on roots, vegetables, seeds, nuts, bark,\r\nleaves, or fruit; but some of them, as the rats, are fond of meat, and\r\nindeed devour anything in the shape of food, and are as ready to eat\r\ncarrion as fresh diet.\r\n\r\nAll rodents are easily tamed, and are often kept in captivity. Rabbits,\r\nsquirrels, and guinea-pigs have always been favorites as pets; even the\r\nrats and mice, in their white specimens with red eyes, have not been\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NIBBLERS.]\r\n\r\nThe rodents include some animals with valuable fur, as the gray\r\nSiberian squirrel, and the chinchillas of the Peruvian and Chilian\r\nmountain ranges. The rodents are generally very prolific, and to the\r\ngreat number of their progeny is due their continuance, in despite of\r\nthe multitudes of them killed every year by their enemies. The hunter,\r\nwith his trap and gun, seeks the rodents for fur or for food; hawks,\r\nvultures, and owls prey upon them; dogs, cats, and foxes constantly lie\r\nin wait for them. Rats also fight among themselves, and prey upon each\r\nother, for the victor feasts upon the vanquished. Rats are also hunted\r\nfor their skins, as thousands of dozens of kid gloves have been first\r\non the backs, not of kids, but of rats.\r\n\r\nAs instances of the rapid increase of rodent families we may note that\r\nthe mother rat has several litters of young each year, and ten or\r\ntwelve at a litter. The fieldmouse has twelve little ones a year, but\r\nall of the same litter.\r\n\r\nThe harvest mouse is the smallest and perhaps the prettiest of all the\r\nrodents. Its back is tan color, brightening on the sides and legs,\r\nwhile all the under part of the body is snow-white and silky. It is not\r\nmuch over an inch long, has bright eyes, and a long, hairy tail; it\r\nlives upon grain, and constructs one of the prettiest of nests for a\r\nhome. Laying together, with their long leaves, three or four stalks of\r\nwheat, oats, or barley, the harvest mouse weaves of grass and leaves a\r\nround, beautiful nest, about as large as that of a titmouse. The nest\r\nis shaped like a ball, and has a small opening on one side. In this\r\nnest the tiny mother places her little ones. She climbs up the wheat\r\nstems by means of her sharp claws, but comes down as one slides down\r\na rope, holding on by one hand. This round nest is the summer home of\r\nthe harvest-mouse. By the time the grain is ripe, some wise instinct\r\nteaches her to remove her household to a new dwelling. She either makes\r\na burrow in the ground, or builds a nest in a corn-crib or hay-rick.\r\n\r\nAnother curious mouse is called the economic mouse, because it lays\r\nup grain and seeds for winter use. In this it resembles certain other\r\nrodents, as the beaver, which lays up a store of bark, the squirrel,\r\nwhich hoards nuts, and the hamster, which lays up grain, beans, peas,\r\nand seeds. Sometimes fifty or a hundred pounds of grain and dried seeds\r\nhave been taken from the burrows of these animals. The squirrels, and\r\nthe “pouched,” or earth-rats, are provided with cheek pouches for\r\ncarrying home their winter store of provisions. Others convey their\r\nbooty in their mouths.\r\n\r\nI had at one time a pair of chipmunks, which made their home in the\r\nfoundation wall of my house. A row of wild cherry trees stood near\r\nthe lawn, and I found that the chipmunks laid up a large store of the\r\ncherry pits, making many journeys daily to and from the trees, and\r\ncarrying off in their cheek pouches a number of pits each time.\r\n\r\nThe season was dry, and one morning I had poured a pitcher of water\r\nover some plants near my porch, when one of the chipmunks passed among\r\nthem on his way to the cherry trees. He stopped, sat on his haunches,\r\ntook one of the wet leaves in his hand, pressed the sides together to\r\nmake a trough for the moisture, and holding it to his mouth drank the\r\nwater in the most comical fashion possible. He drank from five or six\r\nleaves, while I stood watching him. When he went his way, I filled\r\na large saucer with water and placed it near the plants. This was\r\npresently discovered, and both my little chipmunks hereafter drank and\r\nwashed regularly at this dish.\r\n\r\nI made a practice of testing these pretty little fellows’ knowledge\r\nof nuts. When I gave them cracked hickory nuts, they at once sat down,\r\npicked out the meats, and ate them. Cracked nuts were evidently not fit\r\nfor storage. Sitting on their haunches, holding the cracked nuts to\r\ntheir mouths with their hands and using their incisors for nut-picks,\r\nthese creatures were a pretty sight. When I gave them whole nuts, they\r\ntested them, evidently by weight, to see if they were sound. Sound\r\nnuts were promptly carried to the storehouse; poor nuts were dropped.\r\nI never knew these animals to make a mistake. I cracked the rejected\r\nnuts, and never found one of them good.\r\n\r\nWhen walnuts or other hard-shelled nuts that have been emptied by\r\nsquirrels are examined, and the cleanness and accuracy of the cutting\r\nis noted, we get some notion of those beautiful cutting tools, the\r\nincisors. Likewise the wood chiselled by the beaver bears witness to\r\nthe excellence of the tools bestowed upon this order of animals.\r\n\r\nThe gnawers are found in most parts of the world; the deep snows of\r\nSiberia are tracked by the agile feet of the squirrel, the hamster,\r\nand the economic mouse. Cold Norway has hordes of rats, as well as\r\nsquirrels and rabbits. Italy is the only country free from the ravages\r\nof the fieldmouse. In English gardens the dormice love to make their\r\nhomes. Rats and mice live wherever men live. Africa possesses the sand\r\nrat and the brilliant mole rat, which wears a scarlet coat shining with\r\nthe iris tints of the rainbow. The jerboas, with their short fore legs,\r\nand their curiously long hind legs, jump about in Tartary, Russia,\r\nand the African forests. South America has a monopoly of chinchillas\r\nand guinea-pigs. The porcupine is an inhabitant of three-quarters of\r\nthe globe. Once the beaver built its dams and burrows over nearly all\r\nNorth America, and now every woodland abounds in squirrels and rabbits;\r\nalmost every river-side has its musk-rats; every barn and nearly every\r\nhouse is infested with rats and mice. Thousands of hares are every\r\nwinter brought into the English markets. In fact, wherever you go you\r\ncan hear the busy teeth of the rodents, gnawing their way through the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[89] Chapters 48, 49, and 50 give but brief glimpses of numerous\r\nwell-known mammals. The object has been merely to call attention to\r\npeculiarities of structure and other points of interest, and thus\r\nencourage the pupil to seek more extended information in larger works.\r\n\r\n[90] Hares are given to wandering about at night, and porcupines often\r\nfeed and travel by day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIX.\r\n\r\nODD TOES.\r\n\r\n    “A thousand horse, and none to ride!\r\n    With flowing tail, and flying mane,\r\n    Wide nostrils never stretched by pain,\r\n    Mouths bloodless of the bit or rein,\r\n    And feet that iron never shod!”\r\n\r\n                                 --BYRON.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne great order of mammals, is called the ungulata, or hoofed-order.\r\nThe ungulates are animals well fitted for terrestrial life; they are\r\nvegetable-eaters, though now and then one of them, as the hog, may\r\ndisplay some appetite for animal food, and sheep and cows will eat\r\nfish, especially if salted. No order is more familiar to us, as it\r\ncontains all our best-known domestic animals, and those wild animals\r\nmost popular in all menageries or zoological gardens, as the elephant,\r\ncamel, and giraffe; and finally all those animals most ardently pursued\r\nby hunters, as the deer, antelope, and chamois. The order ungulata\r\nembraces two animals so widely different from the others, that they\r\nhave been classified as sub-orders by themselves; one of these species\r\nis that of perhaps the largest land animal, the elephant; the other is\r\nnearly the smallest of all the ungulates, the hyrax, or cony. The hyrax\r\nis the cony mentioned in the Bible, and a verse of Scripture very well\r\ndescribes it: “The conies are a feeble folk, they have their dwellings\r\nin the rocks.” For a long time these little animals were a puzzle to\r\nzoologists, and finally Professor Huxley set them off in a sub-order\r\nall to themselves. Why were they so difficult to arrange? Let us see.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THICK SKINS.]\r\n\r\nIn the first place there are very few of them, and they are all found\r\nin Africa, near the Cape of Good Hope, except one species living in\r\nSyria. They are small creatures, rabbit-like, about eighteen inches\r\nlong, covered with thick fur interspersed with bristles. First, they\r\nwere classed with the rodents, because of their rabbit-like appearance.\r\nBut their teeth turned out to be like those of a rhinoceros, and their\r\nskeletons like those of the hippopotamus family, and therefore they\r\nwere placed among the ungulata. Soon there were other claims made\r\nupon them; their ribs and backbones were like those of that famous\r\ninsect-eater, the sloth. These queer little beasts seemed to belong\r\neverywhere, and to fit nowhere, and they were set up by themselves.\r\n\r\nThe conies are gregarious animals; they live in colonies. They have\r\nno means of offence or defence, and so they make their homes in holes\r\nin the rocks, and stealing out from their stony citadels, they eat\r\ngrass, fruit, seeds, and roots. As they go forth to forage they leave\r\na sentinel perched on a high rock, to watch for danger and give the\r\nalarm. In Africa the lions are their greatest enemies, and as soon as\r\nthe warning of an approaching lion is given, the conies dash off swift\r\nas the wind, to hide in small crevices, where their foe cannot follow\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe other peculiar animal among the ungulates, which demanded a\r\nsub-order all for itself, is the elephant. Of this creature there are\r\nbut two species now living, the Indian and the African elephants. They\r\nare classed by themselves on account of the proboscis or trunk, which\r\nno other animal possesses, and which a little boy described as a “big\r\nbe-front tail, so that the elephant could walk backwards or forwards\r\nall the same.” But this is a most unhappy description of an elephant.\r\n\r\nThe African elephant is the larger species, being sometimes eleven feet\r\nhigh. Its ears are much larger than those of the Asiatic species, are\r\ndifferently set, and there are also differences in the structure of\r\nthe head and teeth. The tusks of the elephant are two large curved,\r\nbony appendages, projecting from the mouth on either side of the trunk.\r\nWhat are they? Why, _teeth_ to be sure! Teeth? Yes; they are the two\r\nincisors such as I told you the beavers have, but the odd thing about\r\nthese teeth is, that, beginning to grow in the second year of the\r\nelephant’s life, they keep on growing as long as he lives. Of course\r\nthey are soon too long to be kept within the shelter of the mouth,\r\nand so they project and grow and grow, until sometimes they become so\r\nenormous as to weigh from one hundred and fifty to two hundred pounds\r\neach. But these are exceptions; from thirty to eighty pounds is a more\r\nusual weight. Sometimes the tusks turn upward; sometimes they grow\r\nalmost straight, or with a downward inclination.\r\n\r\nBesides these huge incisors the elephant has six molars or grinding\r\nteeth on each side of each jaw. As these molars are its only teeth\r\nuseful in eating, we see at once that the food of an elephant must be\r\ngrass, hay, grain, and fruit. The tusks of the elephant are almost\r\nentirely the purest of ivory, and as they are our main source of this\r\nvaluable material, thousands of elephants are slaughtered to secure the\r\ntusks. As the elephant has the fewest young of any known animal, the\r\nrace of elephants cannot keep up with the rapid destruction produced\r\nby the ivory hunters, and there is great danger that it will become\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nIn Africa elephants are not tamed and trained, but in India for many\r\nhundred years they have been kept as beasts of burden, as war animals,\r\nand as ornaments to the state of kings.\r\n\r\nThe most notable characteristic of the elephant is its proboscis. What\r\nis that? As the tusks are two overgrown teeth, so the proboscis is an\r\novergrown nose and upper lip. The nose and upper lip of the elephant\r\nare prolonged into a tube, often six feet long, tapering almost to a\r\npoint. At the extreme end of this organ the nostrils are situated, and\r\nelephants often swim entirely under water, by simply carrying the end\r\nof the proboscis above the surface. The proboscis is composed chiefly\r\nof muscles, four thousand of them we are told, together with many\r\nnerves. Thus it is exceedingly strong, flexible, and very sensitive,\r\nand an injury to it gives the animal intense pain.\r\n\r\nThe proboscis of the elephant is used by its owner with all the ease\r\nand skill of a human hand. Through it, it can draw up water and pour\r\nit over its back, or squirt it wherever it chooses; it can use sand in\r\nthe same way, and by an arrangement of valves near the air-passages,\r\nthe water and sand while thus drawn up are kept out of the nostrils and\r\nair-tubes. The tip of the trunk is prolonged into a finger and a thick\r\nknob which serves for a thumb. With these the elephant can pick up even\r\nso small an object as a cherry or a pin. With this hand-like extremity\r\nof the trunk, the animal conveys food to its mouth.\r\n\r\nTo the elephant its proboscis is indispensable and invaluable; clumsy\r\nin its motions, with a very short neck, which does not permit the head\r\nto bend to the ground, and thick, pillar-like legs, difficult to bend,\r\nwhat would it do without this long, flexible appendage? With it the\r\nelephant collects food and drink, tears off fruit and leaves from the\r\ntrees, and taking a branch for a fan, drives off the teasing insects\r\nwhich settle on its vast body. A horse switches off insects with its\r\ntail, but the tail of the elephant is small, slim, and bare, very like\r\nthat of the pig.\r\n\r\nWith the proboscis the elephant strikes down its enemies, pumps water\r\nfor its bath, lifts a burden to or from its back, defends its young,\r\nand shrieks and roars, as if braying through a trumpet when hurt or\r\nangry. From this trumpeting noise, the French have called the proboscis\r\na “tromp,” or trumpet, which we have corrupted into that senseless name\r\nfor a proboscis, a trunk.\r\n\r\nIn a fight with a lion or tiger, the elephant keeps its proboscis\r\nheld aloft, out of harm’s way, waving it like a banner, and sounding\r\nan alarm, and uses its tusks for a weapon, wherewith to gore or toss\r\nits foe. It also tramples on its enemies, and crushes them with its\r\nenormous weight. With its tusks the elephant also uproots trees when it\r\nwishes to secure dainty leaf-food, too high up to pull down with its\r\nproboscis.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the elephant is bare, exceedingly thick, much wrinkled, and\r\nof a dark lead color, nearly black. The head is large, the eyes are\r\nsmall; the mouth is set under the thick upper part of the trunk, and is\r\nguarded by the tusks. The legs are enormously large and clumsy, and so\r\nare the feet, which have live toes enclosed in a cushion of thick skin\r\nup to the nails.\r\n\r\nElephants live from seventy-five to one hundred and thirty years. The\r\nbaby elephant is woolly about the head and shoulders. It sucks its\r\nmother’s milk not through the proboscis, but with its mouth. The mother\r\nis very fond of her big baby, and is valiant in its defence. Elephants\r\nare enormous feeders, consuming half a bushel of grain and two hundred\r\npounds of green herbage a day.\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of the elephant has been the theme of many stories,\r\nwhich have also celebrated its affection, gratitude, its sensibility\r\nto kindness, its revengeful memory of affronts, and its treacherous\r\ndisposition, given to sudden bursts of rage. White elephants, of which\r\nso much is said, are not a separate species, but albinos.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the greatest of the ungulates. With him in a menagerie\r\nwe often find the tapir, remarkable for its long nose, and as being\r\none of the oldest species of living mammals, therefore of an ancient\r\ndignity of family to which the king-crab, hatteria, opossum, and beaver\r\nmay make their best bows.\r\n\r\nThe hippopotamus is a hoofed animal, next in size to the elephant. It\r\nis a hideous and dirty-looking animal, but one that in a menagerie or\r\ngarden moves our compassion, for it is by its nature an amphibious\r\ncreature, born to live in the rivers, and to spend the most of its time\r\ndiving or swimming, or standing neck deep in water; and nothing can\r\nbe more wretched than its appearance as it chews dry hay, and panting\r\nwaits for a keeper to throw a few pailfuls of water over its fevered\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThe hippopotamus is a tusk-wearer like the elephant, and while the\r\nivory of its tusks is not quite so good as that furnished by the\r\nelephant, it is yet in great demand. The hide is also used in the\r\nmanufacture of boots, trunks, and many instruments.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros is another big specimen of the ungulates, with a bare,\r\nsmooth hide. It is an aquatic animal, wearing a single horn on the\r\nfront of its snout. In its native home, this horn serves to root up\r\nriver-plants, on which it feeds; it is also the weapon of war. Given in\r\nits natural haunts to spending hours in rolling in the mud or wading\r\nin water, the rhinoceros suffers severely in confinement. Usually of\r\na mild, quiet temper, it seems sometimes filled with homesickness and\r\ndespair, and with loud moans dashes its head against the walls of its\r\nprison as if wishing to end its miseries by breaking its skull.\r\n\r\nNo hoofed animal is better known, whether dead or alive, than the pig.\r\nThe pig is the direct descendant of the wild boar, and owes the various\r\nchanges in its appearance and conformation to ages of domestication.\r\nThe wild boar is an animal with long legs, long bristles, lean body,\r\na long snout, and a pair of big tusks formed by the elongation of two\r\ncanine teeth on each side of the mouth. The two canine teeth on the\r\nlower jaw are much larger and stronger than those on the upper. The\r\nboar has fiery little eyes, a fierce and active disposition, and great\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\nIt has been said of the common pig, that it is an animal “manufactured\r\nby man, and he makes it take such shapes as suit his wants best.” By\r\ncareful feeding and breeding the tusks are lost, the bristles decrease,\r\nthe head and legs diminish, the body and haunches greatly develop. Fed\r\nand sheltered, the pig is mild and lazy. Turned loose in the woods,\r\nfor several generations, the snout and legs lengthen, the body grows\r\nthinner, and many of the characteristics of the boar return. Various\r\nfamous breeds of pigs take their name from localities where they are\r\nreared, as the Berkshire, Suffolk, Norman, Pyrenean, and Perigord\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThe horse is the most noble of all the thick-skins, and indeed of\r\nall brutes. Its immediate relatives are the ass, quagga, and zebra.\r\nThe curious stages and changes in the development of the horse have\r\nalready been given.[91] Docile and quick to learn, the horse has been\r\ntrained and used by men from the earliest antiquity. Only one of this\r\nspecies remains superior to domestication, the wild ass of the Himalaya\r\nregions. The zebra also is restless and intractable, and is not often\r\nreduced to a domestic state. Why of all the horse kind should the\r\ngentle, tractable, humble, strong, patient, easily-fed donkey have been\r\nchosen as the constant recipient of scorn; abuse, and hard fare? Scant\r\nfood and plentiful kicks and curses are the portion of one of the most\r\nuseful and gentle of brutes. Much more hardy than his cousin, the\r\nhorse, demanding only a little water and the coarsest fare, the poor\r\ndonkey gets many blows and few thanks for tireless service. Hats off to\r\nthe donkey, who always does the best he can.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[91] Lesson 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON L.\r\n\r\nEVEN TOES.\r\n\r\n    “Then bend your gaze across the waste--what see ye? The giraffe\r\n    Majestic stalks toward the lagoon, the turbid lymph to quaff;\r\n    With outstretched neck, and tongue adust, he kneels him down to cool\r\n    His hot thirst with a welcome draught from foul and brackish pool.”\r\n\r\n                                                      --F. FREILIGRATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe order of ungulate has for its second sub-order the even-toed\r\nanimals. This group is distinguished by the power and habit, which\r\nall its species have, of bringing back into the mouth, food already\r\nswallowed, in order to re-chew it thoroughly. This habit is called\r\nruminating or chewing the cud. We have all observed it in sheep, kine,\r\nand camels.\r\n\r\nThe most notable characteristic of these animals is the formation of\r\nthe stomach, which is divided into several compartments of different\r\nconstruction. The second of these stomach compartments is small and\r\nlined with cells of a honey-combed appearance. The slightly chewed\r\nfood, on reaching this receptacle, is gradually moulded into pellets or\r\nsmall masses, which, instead of passing into the next lower division of\r\nthe digestive apparatus, rise into the throat, are re-conveyed to the\r\nanimal’s mouth, and are slowly chewed into a fine pulp. Any one who has\r\nwatched a cow or sheep lying at ease, calmly and steadily chewing the\r\ncud, has seen a picture of quiet enjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe lowest division of the stomach of a cud-chewer is called the\r\nrennet-bag, from a fluid called rennet, which it contains, which\r\ndigests all the food. Rennet has the property of curdling milk, or\r\nrather of making it partly solid without rendering it sour. It is used\r\nin making cheese. This rennet, mingled with the well-masticated food\r\nof the cud-chewers, completes the process of digestion. All liquids\r\nswallowed by these animals find their way at once to the rennet-bag.\r\n\r\nAll cud-chewers feed upon vegetable substances, and chiefly upon\r\ngrass, of which they eat the stalks and fibrous portions as well as\r\nthe blades. In a former lesson we spoke of the need of sheep for\r\n“roughness,” as stock men call it--a need which is shared by all\r\nruminants. This roughness is the coarse and innutritious portions\r\nmixed with the richer parts of their food, to enable them to chew the\r\ncud, and to prevent indigestion, which would be caused by too rich and\r\ncompact diet.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of cud-chewers are especially formed for grazing; there are\r\nno incisors or cutting teeth on the upper jaw, except in the camel\r\nfamily. The teeth are of two kinds, incisors (on the lower jaw) and\r\ngrinders, or molars. These grinders are wide teeth, and as the jaws\r\nmove, the molars act upon each other from side to side, the lower jaw\r\ngrinding against the upper one. Watch a cow as she eats, and you will\r\nobserve this motion.\r\n\r\nNow let us look at these even-toed feet. You will say that these\r\nanimals have hoofs divided in the centre, while the hoof of a horse\r\nis not divided at all. The pig, which does not ruminate, has a hoof\r\ncentrally divided, like that of a sheep; and the hare, which chews\r\nthe cud, has several separate toes, and belongs to the rodents. Amid\r\nall this diversity there is this constant characteristic, that the\r\ncud-chewers of the ungulates have the toes of each foot collected under\r\nwhat is called a cloven hoof, as if a solid hoof had been cleft into\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nThere are four families of even-toed ruminants--the hollow-horned,\r\nincluding kine, sheep, goats, and antelopes, the deer tribe, the camel\r\ntribe, and the camelopards.\r\n\r\nTo the hollow-horned family belong our most useful domestic animals,\r\nand those earliest associated with man. The cow family affords us\r\nbeef, our principal meat food, also butter, cheese, and milk; while\r\nthe hides furnish our chief supply of leather. The bones are used for\r\nmaking buttons, combs, knife-handles; the hair is used in plaster; glue\r\nand gelatine and calves’ foot jelly are made from the hoofs. Oxen are\r\nlargely used for draught purposes. What, then, should we do without the\r\nbovine race?\r\n\r\nThe sheep was no doubt the first domesticated animal; its gentle\r\nnature, and the ease with which it can be reared, made it an early\r\nassociate with the homes of men; its wool furnishes probably our chief\r\nclothing supply; its flesh is a favorite food; many nations drink its\r\nmilk, from which they make also cheese and butter. Thus we have in the\r\nsheep an animal indispensable to our civilization.\r\n\r\nThe goat is a third hollow-horn, the flesh and milk of which are much\r\nused in many countries, while the goat’s long and silky hair is in\r\ndemand for woven fabrics.\r\n\r\nFinally among the hollow-horns we find the famous animals of the\r\nantelope family, the beautiful, timid gazelle, the fleet chamois, the\r\nfierce, untamable gnu, the graceful ibex. If we had time to describe\r\nall these, we should find before us some of the most charming creatures\r\nin the world. They live in high mountain districts, and the Swiss is\r\nnever more happy than when he pursues the chamois over the steep crests\r\nand among the crags of his native land.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most untamable of the hollow-horns is that cousin of\r\nour patient, useful ox, the bison, or buffalo,[92] an animal rapidly\r\nbecoming extinct through cruel and wanton slaughter. While few of us\r\nhave seen the bison himself, his shaggy pelt is well known in the\r\nbuffalo robes of our sleighs and carriages, and in the heavy overcoats\r\nmade for northern travel. Next to the elephant and the rhinoceros, the\r\nbison is the largest of land-mammals.\r\n\r\nIf we lived in Arabia instead of America, we should set beside the\r\nsheep, as the special ally of men, the camel. We have all seen this\r\ncreature in menageries and zoological gardens,--a tall, awkward beast,\r\nwith long legs, a shambling gait, one or two humps on its oddly shapen\r\nback, a small head, the upper lip split in the centre, a long neck,\r\nsmall ears, a dusty, shaggy coat, and a demeanor of patient endurance.\r\nBuffon says that “the camel is the chief treasure of the East.”\r\n\r\nGentle and hardy, demanding but little food, and that of the coarsest\r\ndescription,--a few dates, a few handfuls of grain,--capable of going\r\nfor days without water, a strong beast of burden, this is one of the\r\nmost important members of an Arab family. The milk of the camel affords\r\nthe Arab cheese, and also a nourishing drink; of the animal’s long hair\r\nis woven cloth for clothing and for tent covering; its flesh is used\r\nfor food; and across the long, hot, arid stretches of his desert land,\r\nthe Arab rides in safety, seated on his tent and household goods piled\r\nupon the back of this “ship of the desert.”\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest times the camel has been the only means of conveying\r\ntravellers and Eastern commodities across the desert. It travels thirty\r\nor forty miles a day, under the hot sun, carrying a burden of five\r\nhundred or six hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nCamels have broad, callous soles over the bottoms of their feet. These\r\nenable them to tread firmly without sinking in the desert sand. There\r\nare also callous knobs on their knees and breasts, which protect them\r\nas they kneel to receive burdens, or sleep in a kneeling position. The\r\ntraining of the young camel begins when it is but a few days old, and\r\nit is taught to get along with the smallest possible allowance of food,\r\ndrink, and sleep.\r\n\r\nThe stomach of the camel is provided with numerous little sacs, called\r\nwater-cells; these drain off a considerable quantity of water when\r\nthe camel is drinking, and retain it for several days, restoring\r\nit gradually to the stomach. The camel seems to prefer coarse,\r\nunsucculent, dry food, and burning sunshine; it never seeks the shade.\r\nIt is perhaps apathetic, rather than gentle; it seems little impressed\r\nby kindness, and, like the elephant, has a long memory for injuries.\r\n\r\nFollowing the camel in our menageries usually comes a very\r\nstrange-looking beast, the tallest of all animals. With its long neck,\r\nsmall head, and its habit of browsing off the tree-tops, it reminds us\r\nof what we have read of that fossil beast, the iguanodon. This is the\r\ngiraffe, often called the camelopard, which name is given it because\r\nit has a somewhat camel-like form, and the beautiful spotted skin of a\r\nleopard.\r\n\r\nIf we watch a giraffe in a menagerie, we shall remark the beauty of its\r\nsilky, spotted coat, the gentleness of its large, eager eyes, its two\r\nshort horns covered with skin, its ears turned backward, its long, dark\r\ntongue, with which it constantly licks its lips and nostrils. Timid\r\nand mild, the giraffe shows vexation only by pawing the ground rapidly\r\nwith its fore hoofs; it will bend its stately head to accept an apple\r\nor a carrot from a little child, and seems to forget the days when it\r\nwandered through the African forests, and browsed on fruit and leaves\r\nfrom the tops of the trees.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe is one of the swiftest of animals, and it is almost\r\nimpossible to take an adult alive. They are generally captured while\r\nvery young, and brought up on camels’ milk, until old enough to eat\r\ngrain and green fodder.\r\n\r\nThe Western hemisphere gives us no animal corresponding to the giraffe.\r\nIn South America the llama in some measure represents and takes the\r\nplace of the camel; but the tall and beautiful giraffe stands alone of\r\nhis kind.\r\n\r\nWe now turn to the fourth family of the ruminants, distinguished by the\r\nfact that they shed and renew their horns. The horns of the cow, ox,\r\nsheep, antelope, and goat are permanent. If by any accident they are\r\nlost, they are not renewed; but the deer family shed their horns, which\r\nindeed, are not properly called horns, but antlers. Antlers are a horny\r\ngrowth, large and branching, divided into what are called tines. Up to\r\na certain age these antlers grow, fall off, and are renewed every year,\r\nand there is no mammal peculiarity more wonderful than the rapid growth\r\nof these large frontal ornaments. In many of the deer species the male\r\nalone wears the antlers. In the reindeer family both males and females\r\nhave these huge horny branches.\r\n\r\nThe deer family is distinguished for grace of movement and beauty of\r\nform. They have smooth, close, hairy coats, but on the breast of the\r\nmale deer the hair grows long and is called a beard. The eyes are\r\nlarge, clear, and bright, full of gentle eagerness, and furnished on\r\nthe inner corner with a curious hollow, or gland, called the tear-pit.\r\nThey have small, pointed ears, and short tails; their legs are slim,\r\nand their hoofs are small, the whole animal being built for lightness\r\nin running. Even the antlers are not nearly so heavy as they look, for\r\nthey are porous and full of air-cells.\r\n\r\nThe deer family is distributed over the entire world. Deer vary in\r\nsize from the large elk or moose, the royal stag, and the magnificent\r\nwapiti, to the small roe deer, not so large as a sheep, and the pigmy\r\ndeer, which is the smallest of all ruminants, and indeed, is not larger\r\nthan a hare.\r\n\r\nDeer are vegetable-feeders, and in the coldest climates are capable of\r\nliving on lichens, and the scantiest fare. In the far north reindeer\r\nor caribous furnish the chief wealth of the people, and serve instead\r\nof cows, horses, and sheep, their flesh and milk being the chief\r\nfood-supply, and their skins furnishing clothing and bedding. They\r\nserve also as draught animals, and pull sledges over the snow with\r\nincredible swiftness.\r\n\r\nDeer generally live in herds; the mother is a most vigilant and tender\r\nparent, devoting herself to her twin children with tireless care.\r\nDeer are distinguished for the perfection of their senses of sight,\r\nsmell, and hearing, and as soon as one of a herd discovers anything\r\nthat indicates danger, the alarm is given, and away they go. The deer\r\nmothers, while feeding, are constantly alert, and hurry their little\r\nones off at the first hint of danger. The general disposition of the\r\ndeer is amiable, but the old males sometimes fight furiously together,\r\nand if brought to bay by hunters, defend themselves valiantly with\r\nhoofs and horns.\r\n\r\nPassing now from the ungulates, we reach a very well-known order of\r\nmammals, called the carnivora, or flesh-eaters. This order is divided\r\ninto two sub-orders, the pinnipeds, or “fin-footed,” and the fissipeds,\r\nor “slit-footed.” In our study of the seal we have had the best example\r\nof the fin-footed, or aquatic carnivora. Bring up your dog or your cat\r\nfor a sample of the slit-footed flesh-eaters. Ponto, set your foot down\r\nfirmly, and let us look at it. All the toes are of equal length; the\r\nfoot looks as if a roundish foot had been deeply slit into toes, which\r\nare hairy up to the nails. The feet of web-footed animals would look\r\nlike this if they were not webbed.[93]\r\n\r\nThese slit-footed, or fissiped creatures, are divided into several\r\nspecies, and there is considerable difference in their way of treading;\r\nsome, as the cats, walk on their toes. Come here, kitty, let us see\r\nyour feet. Kitty can draw her claws close into the “velvet,” or fur,\r\nof her paw so that you would not know she had sharp nails. As she does\r\nthis she curls her foot up into a cushion, and walks on the ends of\r\nher toes. Look at her foot when she stretches it; how well you can see\r\nthe slit-foot arrangement and the clawed toes. Kitty is a mild and\r\ndomestic representative of the great, feline race, at the head of which\r\nstands the lion. Ponto, on the other hand, is a civilized and educated\r\nspecimen of the canine race, which numbers among its members the wolf.\r\n\r\nWhile kitty draws in her claws and walks on her toes, the bears are\r\nwhat is called plantigrade carnivora, for they walk on the flat soles\r\nof their feet. These carnivora are all flesh-eaters, but when educated\r\nand refined, like Ponto and Kitty, they will eat any kind of food.\r\n\r\nAmong the carnivora we enumerate lions, tigers, bears, cougars,\r\nhyenas, panthers, wolves, jackals, leopards, cats, dogs, badgers, and\r\nmany more. You see they embrace all the fiercest and most dangerous\r\nwild beasts, as well as our domestic friends, the cat and the dog.\r\nIf you will open Kitty’s mouth, or Ponto’s, you will see what style\r\nof teeth these carnivora have; they are made for tearing flesh, and\r\nare accompanied by sharp claws for holding fast the living prey. All\r\nthe carnivora are singularly strong, agile, and tenacious of life.\r\nThe carnivora are so varied and interesting, that we leave them to\r\nbe studied elsewhere, and indeed so we must serve the final order of\r\nmammals--the primates.[94]\r\n\r\nThese primates are divided into two sub-orders, the quadrumana, or\r\nfour-handed animals, and the human race. Many scientists, instead\r\nof the order primates, with these two sub-orders, give us the order\r\nquadrumana, or monkeys, and the order bimana, or man, and that is the\r\nbetter division.\r\n\r\nThe quadrumana, or ape families, contain a large number of curious and\r\ninteresting animals, all natives of tropical regions. They are hairy\r\ncreatures, with three kinds of teeth, and are adapted for eating nearly\r\nall kinds of food. They are well known to us in menageries, and are\r\nfrequently seen on our streets, fancifully dressed, and in company with\r\na man and an organ, surrounded also by a group of admiring children.\r\n\r\n“How many children are there in your family, Pierre?” we one day asked\r\na bright little Italian boy.\r\n\r\n“Four, and the monkey, signora.”\r\n\r\n“But the monkey, Pierre, does not count with the children.”\r\n\r\n“O signora! for care and trouble he counts more than the children! He\r\nmust have the warmest corner and the best food. At night, for warmth,\r\nhe sleeps in my father’s arms. He gets cold ten times as often as we\r\ndo; and if he gets a cold he must have the doctor, for he is likely\r\nto die. If he dies, away go all our saved dollars for more monkey!\r\nGracious! O signora! do you think our father would let our monkey run\r\nround in the streets and look out for his own dinner as Marie and I do?\r\nThe thing is impossible!”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[92] The animal called a buffalo in America is not a buffalo, but a\r\nbison. The buffalo of India and Italy is the _Bubalus_, the buffalo of\r\nthe Western plains is the bison. The large, wild bison of Germany is\r\ncalled the Aurochs. All these animals belong to the family Bovidæ.\r\n\r\n[93] If we examine the toes of the cat and dog, we shall see that the\r\nskin extends web-like partly up the toe bones.\r\n\r\n[94] It has been impossible in so small a book to discuss with any\r\nminuteness the subjects noticed in the closing chapters. It is hoped\r\nthat the hints given will incite pupils to study and observe the\r\ndomestic animals of which we see so much and know so little.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEA-SIDE AND WAY-SIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illustration from NO. 1.--MR.
