No,\r\nthe good business man is the man who knows business.\r\n\r\nAre you a good business man?\r\n\r\n\"Up to the average,\" you say.\r\n\r\nWell, what do you know of business laws and rules, outside your\r\npresent circle of routine work?\r\n\r\nNow, this handy little volume is a condensation of the rules and\r\nthe laws which every man, from the day laborer to the banker,\r\nshould be familiar with.\r\n\r\nWe have not put in everything about business, for that would\r\nrequire a library, instead of a book that can be read in a short\r\nday, and be consulted for its special information at any time.\r\n\r\nIt isn't a question of the price of the book to you, or of the\r\nprofit to the publisher. Is it good?\r\n\r\nMany a man has failed because he did not know the rules and laws\r\nherein given.\r\n\r\nNever a man has won honestly who did not carry out these rules and\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nCOMMON SENSE FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe three things essential to all wealth production are land,\r\nlabor, and capital.\r\n\r\n\"The dry land\" was created before there appeared the man, the\r\nlaborer, to work it. With his bare hands the worker could have\r\ndone nothing with the land either as a grazer, a farmer or a\r\nminer. From the very first he needed capital, that is, the tools\r\nto work the land.\r\n\r\nThe first tool may have been a pole, one end hardened in the fire,\r\nor a combined hoe and axe, made by fastening with wythes, a\r\nsuitable stone to the end of a stick; but no matter the kind of\r\ntool, or the means of producing it, it represented capital, and\r\nthe man who owned this tool was a capitalist as compared with the\r\nman without any such appliance.\r\n\r\nFrom the land, with the aid of labor and capital, comes wealth,\r\nwhich in a broad way may be defined as something having an\r\nexchangeable value.\r\n\r\nBefore the appearance of money all wealth changed hands through\r\nbarter. The wealth in the world to-day is immeasurably greater\r\nthan all the money in it. The business of the world, particularly\r\nbetween nations, is still carried on through exchange, the\r\nbalances being settled by money.\r\n\r\nMoney is a medium of exchange, and should not be confounded with\r\nwealth or capital; the latter is that form of wealth which is used\r\nwith labor in all production.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, wealth is of two kinds, dormant and active. The\r\nformer awaits the development of labor and capital, the latter is\r\nthe product of both.\r\n\r\nLabor is human effort, in any form, used for the production of\r\nwealth. It is of two kinds--skilled and unskilled. The former may\r\nbe wholly mental, the latter may be wholly manual.\r\n\r\nThe successful farmer must be a skilled laborer, no matter the\r\namount of his manual work. The unskilled farmer can never succeed\r\nlargely, no matter how hard he works.\r\n\r\nTrained hands with trained brains are irresistible.\r\n\r\nToo many farmers live in the ruts cut by their great-great-\r\ngrandfathers. They still balance the corn in the sack with a\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nFarming is the world's greatest industry. All the ships might be\r\ndocked, all the factory wheels stopped, and all the railroads\r\nturned to streaks of rust, and still the race would survive, but\r\nlet the plow lie idle for a year and man would perish as when the\r\ndeluge swept the mountain tops.\r\n\r\nThe next census will show considerably over 6,000,000 farms in the\r\nUnited States. Farming is the greatest of all industries, as it is\r\nthe most essential. Our Government has wisely made the head of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture a cabinet officer, and the effect on our\r\nfarming interest is shown in improved methods and a larger output\r\nof better quality.\r\n\r\nThe hap-hazard, unskilled methods of the past are disappearing.\r\nScience is lending her aid to the tiller of the soil, and the wise\r\nones are reaching out their hands in welcome.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS METHODS NEEDED\r\n\r\nAs farming is our principal business, it follows that those who\r\nconduct this vast and varied enterprise should be business men.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is a producer of goods, and so might be regarded as a\r\nmanufacturer,--the original meaning of the word is one who makes\r\nthings by hand. He is also a seller of his own products, and a\r\npurchaser of the products of others, so that, to some extent, he\r\nmay also be regarded as a trader or merchant.\r\n\r\nEnterprise and business skill are the requisites of the\r\nmanufacturer and merchant. Can the farmer succeed without them?\r\n\r\nNo business can prosper without method, economy, and industry\r\nintelligently applied.\r\n\r\nNo man works harder the year round than does the American farmer,\r\nyet too many are going back instead of advancing. In such cases it\r\nwill be found that there is enough hard work for better results,\r\nand that the cause of failure is that the industry has not been\r\nproperly applied, and that economy has had no consideration.\r\n\r\nEconomy does not mean niggardliness, or a determination to get\r\nalong without tools that your neighbor has purchased. A neglect to\r\nsecure the best tool needed might be classed as an extravagance, a\r\nwaste, if the tool in question could have added to the quality and\r\nquantity of the output, without the expenditure of more labor.\r\n\r\nBusiness common-sense is taking the place of old-fashioned\r\nconservatism and scientific methods are no longer sneered at as\r\n\"book-farming.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDOCUMENTS EVERY FARMER SHOULD UNDERSTAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll property implies an owner. Property is of two kinds, real and\r\npersonal. The former is permanent and fixed, the latter can be\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nEvery occupant of realty holds it through a deed, which carries\r\nwith it sole ownership, or through a lease which carries with it\r\nthe right to occupation and use in accordance with the conditions\r\nas to time and the amount to be paid, set forth in the written\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nA deed carries with it sole ownership, a lease covers the right of\r\nuse for a fixed period.\r\n\r\nAS TO DEEDS\r\n\r\nThe purchaser of real estate, say a farm, should receive, from the\r\nperson selling the property, a written instrument, or conveyance\r\nknown as a deed.\r\n\r\nThe deed must show clearly that the title to or interest in the\r\nproperty has been transferred from the seller to the buyer.\r\n\r\nBefore the deed is signed and delivered, the buyer should know\r\nthat he is getting a clear title to the property described in the\r\nconveyance.\r\n\r\nIn order to insure the accuracy of the title and thus avoid\r\nsubsequent complications and perhaps lawsuits, the paper should be\r\nsubmitted to some good lawyer, or other person acquainted with\r\nreal estate law and the methods by which titles are traced from\r\nthe first owner to the present possessor.\r\n\r\nTITLE ABSTRACTS\r\n\r\nIn all the great business centers of the United States there are\r\nTitle Guarantee Companies, who for a consideration--to be paid by\r\nthe seller--furnish an abstract of title, and insure its validity.\r\n\r\nIn smaller places the local lawyers know how to make up an\r\nabstract and one should be employed. Never trust the search of the\r\ninexperienced.\r\n\r\nAn abstract of title is a memorandum taken from the records of the\r\noffice where deeds are recorded, and showing the history of the\r\ntitle from the Government up to the present time.\r\n\r\nThe seller should furnish the buyer with a certificate from the\r\nproper county officer, showing whether or not all taxes have been\r\npaid up to the last assessment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, before the money is paid and the deed\r\naccepted, the purchaser should be satisfied that there are no\r\nmortgages, liens, attachments or other claims against the\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIf such claims exist and are known to the buyer, he may assume\r\nthem as a condition of the sale.\r\n\r\nPARTIES TO A DEED\r\n\r\nThe person selling the land and making the deed is known in law as\r\nthe Grantor. The person buying the property is known as the\r\nGrantee.\r\n\r\nA deed is a form of contract, and in order to have its terms and\r\nstatements binding on the maker, he must be twenty-one years of\r\nage, or over, and he must be of sound mind.\r\n\r\nThe grantee need not be twenty-one, nor of sound mind in order to\r\nmake the terms of the deed binding on the grantor.\r\n\r\nIn some states, if the grantor be a married man, his wife must\r\nsign the deed with him. This should be seen to, for without the\r\nwife's signature the grantee will not have a clear title, for the\r\nwoman could still claim an interest in the property equal to her\r\ndower right.\r\n\r\nAlso, if the grantor is a woman, her husband, for the reasons\r\ngiven, should join with her in the execution of the deed.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a deed should not be left to the unskilled.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT DEEDS\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of deeds, viz.: General warranty deeds,\r\nspecial warranty deeds, and quit-claim deeds.\r\n\r\nThe general warranty deed, if it can be had, is the one every\r\npurchaser should get.\r\n\r\nIn the general warranty deed the grantor agrees for himself, \"his\r\nheirs, executors, administrators, and assigns,\" that at the time\r\nof making the deed he is lawfully in possession, \"seized\" is the\r\nlegal term, of the estate described in the deed, that it is free\r\nfrom all incumbrance, and that he will warrant and defend the\r\ngrantee and his heirs and assigns against all claims whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn the quit-claim deed the grantor conveys to the purchaser his\r\ninterest in or right to the property under consideration.\r\n\r\nThe quit-claim grantor does not guarantee the title to the\r\nproperty, nor warrant the grantee against any other claims. He\r\nsimply, by the deed, quits his claim to the property.\r\n\r\nThe special warranty deed covenants and warrants only against the\r\nacts of the grantor and those claiming title under him.\r\n\r\nMAKING A DEED\r\n\r\nAfter a deed is properly drawn, it is ready to be signed, sealed,\r\nand delivered to the grantee.\r\n\r\nIf the wife of the grantor is to sign, her name should follow that\r\nof her husband.\r\n\r\nIf one or both cannot write, the signature can be made in this\r\nway:\r\n\r\n            His\r\n      George X Jones.\r\n           Mark.\r\n\r\nWitness..............\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some states one or more witnesses are required to the signature\r\nof the grantor; in others, witnesses are not necessary, except\r\nwhere a \"mark\" is made.\r\n\r\nAn important part of a deed is the Acknowledgment. This is the act\r\nof acknowledging before a notary public, justice or other official\r\nproperly qualified to administer an oath, that the signatures are\r\ngenuine and made voluntarily.\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgment having been taken, the official stamps the\r\npaper with his seal and signs it.\r\n\r\nIn some states the law requires that a wax or paper seal be\r\nattached to the paper, while in others a circular scroll, made\r\nwith the pen, with the letters \"L.S.\" in the center answer the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the foregoing essentials are complied with the deed must be\r\ndelivered to the grantee. The delivery is essential, for without\r\nit the deed is of no value, even though every other requisite be\r\ncomplied with.\r\n\r\nA deed may be made for land on which full payment has already been\r\nacknowledged, but if the grantor dies before the deed is\r\ndelivered, then the deed has no legal value.\r\n\r\nA deed obtained by fraud, deceit or compulsion is void.\r\n\r\nRECORDING DEEDS\r\n\r\nAs soon as possible after the grantee has received the deed, he\r\nshould have it recorded.\r\n\r\nIn every county in the different states there is an officer, known\r\nas register or recorder, whose duty it is to enter in regular\r\nfolios, or books, a copy of every deed or mortgage presented to\r\nhim. The document then becomes a part of the county records.\r\n\r\nThe grantee must pay the recording fees.\r\n\r\nAnyone, on paying the fee for copying and certifying, can obtain a\r\ncopy of any document that has been recorded in a register's\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIf an original deed is lost, the certified copy of the register\r\nhas all the legality of the original.\r\n\r\nAll deeds and other papers of value should be carefully kept, so\r\nthat they may be available, if needed.\r\n\r\nA small safe deposit box with a company that keeps such spaces for\r\nrent, is often a wise investment.\r\n\r\nKeep all related papers in one package or envelope.\r\n\r\nIf there is one lawyer who attends to all your legal business, he\r\nwill be a good custodian of all papers of record, for he usually\r\nhas a fireproof safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nOTHER FORMS OF DEEDS--MORTGAGES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one condition under which the grantor does not turn over\r\nor deliver the deed to the grantee after it is made. This is known\r\nas a Deed in Escrow.\r\n\r\nA deed \"delivered in escrow\" is when the document is placed with a\r\nthird party to be by him delivered to the grantee when a certain\r\ntime has elapsed or certain conditions have been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nWhen the conditions have been complied with, the deed is given by\r\nits custodian to the grantee, which is as legal as if it were\r\ngiven by the grantor in person.\r\n\r\nTRUST DEEDS\r\n\r\nA trust deed is the form used to convey property to some person\r\nwho is entitled to its proceeds or profits.\r\n\r\nThis form of deed is often used to secure the payment of a debt.\r\nIn some states they take the place of mortgages.\r\n\r\nWhere the trust deed is meant to take the place of a mortgage to\r\nsecure a debt payment, the property is deeded to a third party\r\nknown as a \"trustee.\"\r\n\r\nThe trustee in this case is the agent for debtor and creditor, and\r\nhe must act impartially.\r\n\r\nThe trust deed specifies the character of the debt to be secured.\r\nIn case of failure to pay the debt as agreed on, the trustee may,\r\nif so warranted, sell the property, and pay the obligation from\r\nthe proceeds.\r\n\r\nThe grantor in a trust deed, if not stipulated to the contrary, is\r\nentitled to all the rents and profits of the property; for it\r\nremains virtually his, until he has failed to fill his contract.\r\n\r\nWhen the indebtedness secured by the trust deed has been paid, the\r\ntrustee must at once execute a paper known to law as a Release\r\nDeed. When recorded this instrument discharges the lien.\r\n\r\nAS TO MORTGAGES\r\n\r\nMortgages are of two kinds, real and chattel. The first is a lien\r\non real estate, the second on personal property.\r\n\r\nA mortgage may be defined as a conveyance of property, personal or\r\nreal, as security for the payment of a debt, or it may be given as\r\na guarantee for the performance of some particular duty.\r\n\r\nMORTGAGE FORMS\r\n\r\nWhen a mortgage is given as security for the payment of a debt,\r\nthe rule is to give a note for the payment of the amount involved.\r\nThe mortgage becomes in this case the security for the note's\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nIn the body of the note it must be stated that it is secured by\r\nmortgage.\r\n\r\nThe date of the note and mortgage should be the same.\r\n\r\nThe man who mortgages his property is the mortgagor.\r\n\r\nThe man to whom the mortgage is given is the mortgagee.\r\n\r\nThe form of the mortgage is the same as that of a deed, except\r\nthat it contains a clause called the Defeasance, which states that\r\nwhen the obligation has been met the document shall be void.\r\n\r\nMORTGAGES MUST BE RECORDED\r\n\r\nThe forms for \"signing, sealing and delivering\" a mortgage, are\r\nthe same as with a deed.\r\n\r\nA mortgage must be recorded the same as a deed, the mortgagee\r\npaying the fees.\r\n\r\nChattel mortgages are filed and recorded in the same way, except\r\nthat it is not usual to make copies of the instrument. They are\r\ndescribed in books prepared for the purpose.\r\n\r\nA wife need not join her husband in making the note secured by a\r\nmortgage, but if she agrees to the transaction it is necessary for\r\nher to sign the mortgage; however, some states do not require\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nPAYMENTS\r\n\r\nOften a life insurance policy is used as security for the payment\r\nof a mortgage.\r\n\r\nThe mortgagee, if there be buildings on the property, should see\r\nthat the buildings are insured and that the policy or policies are\r\nmade out in his name.\r\n\r\nIf the insurance policy is in the mortgagor's name he may collect\r\nand keep the insurance money.\r\n\r\nThe mortgagor must meet, as stipulated, every payment of the\r\nprincipal and interest.\r\n\r\nFailure to meet one payment can result in a legal foreclosure.\r\n\r\nWhen a payment is made, the date and the amount must be entered on\r\nthe back of the note. This should be done in the presence of the\r\nmortgagor.\r\n\r\nIf possible always pay the obligation by check.\r\n\r\nIf a payment is accepted on a mortgage and the amount is not\r\nsufficient to meet the sum required, the interest is first settled\r\nin full, the rest is credited to the principal.\r\n\r\nWhen the full amount, with interest, is paid in, it becomes the\r\nduty of the mortgagee to have the mortgage \"discharged.\"\r\n\r\nA complete settlement is when, all payments being made, the\r\nmortgagee surrenders the note and its security, and causes to be\r\nwritten by the register, on the margin of the copy in his books,\r\nthe words, \"discharged,\" or \"satisfied,\" affixing thereto his\r\nofficial signature and the date.\r\n\r\nASSIGNMENTS\r\n\r\nA mortgage is regarded in law as personal property.\r\n\r\nA mortgage need not remain in the hands of the mortgagee in order\r\nto be valid. It can be sold like bonds, stocks or other property,\r\nand there are men who deal only in that form of security.\r\n\r\nIn order to sell a mortgage, the owner must make, to the\r\npurchaser, what is known as an \"assignment of mortgage.\"\r\n\r\nThe assignment should be recorded in the same way as the original\r\nmortgage, the assignee paying the fee.\r\n\r\nREDEMPTION OF MORTGAGES\r\n\r\nWhile the rule as to the redemption of mortgages remains the same\r\nin some localities that it formerly was, the law in most places is\r\nnow more lenient.\r\n\r\nNow the mortgagor who has failed is usually given by law an\r\nextension of time in which to make good the payment of principal\r\nand interest.\r\n\r\nLenders, when the interest is met, are content to let the mortgage\r\nrun on as an investment, though it will often be found, in such\r\ncases, that it is better to make a new mortgage.\r\n\r\nEQUITY OF REDEMPTION\r\n\r\nWhere the payments on a mortgage have not been met and the\r\ninstrument has not been foreclosed, the mortgagor has still what\r\nis known as an \"equity of redemption.\"\r\n\r\nIn some states after the foreclosure of the mortgage and the sale\r\nof the property there is still a period of redemption of from\r\nsixty days to six years.\r\n\r\nThe mode of foreclosure differs in some states. The usual method\r\nis to foreclose on an order from the court, and to have the sale\r\nconducted by a court officer.\r\n\r\nThe proceeds from the sale are used to pay the principal,\r\ninterests and costs. If there is money left over it is paid to the\r\nmortgagor, whose interests in the property are then at an end.\r\n\r\nMany people, not familiar with business methods, are inclined to\r\nregard a mortgage as something of a disgrace, when, as a matter of\r\nfact it is a most usual and honorable means of raising money for\r\nthe securing of a home or the conducting of a business.\r\n\r\nNearly all of the great railroads of the country have been built\r\nby the sale of the mortgage bonds, which are usually renewed when\r\ndue, and are sought out as a safe and sane form of investment.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a mortgage payment has to be met on a farm is often\r\nin itself the strongest inducement to industry and economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWILLS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether farmer, manufacturer, merchant or professional man, and\r\nwhether in youth, mid-age or declining years, every owner of\r\npersonal or real property, or both, should make a will.\r\n\r\nIf you have not made a will, get over the foolish notion that it\r\nis a premonition of death, and do so at once.\r\n\r\nA will is a written and signed declaration of the disposition one\r\nwishes to have made of his property in the event of his death.\r\n\r\nThe maker of a valid will must be of sound mind and not less than\r\ntwenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nWomen, whether married or single, if of proper age, are competent\r\nto make a will.\r\n\r\nOF TWO KINDS\r\n\r\nA will may be written or unwritten.\r\n\r\nUnwritten wills are known as \"nun-cupative.\" Nun-cupative wills\r\nare employed only when through accident, or sudden seizure by a\r\nfatal disease, the time necessary to write and sign a will cannot\r\nbe had.\r\n\r\nThe unwritten will must be authenticated by reliable and\r\nunprejudiced witnesses, and generally it can dispose of personal\r\nproperty only.\r\n\r\nIn the written will no precise form is necessary, though when\r\ndrawn by a lawyer it usually begins with some such form as: \"I,\r\nGeorge Brown, being of sound mind and good understanding, do make\r\nand declare this to be my last will and testament\", etc.\r\n\r\nA will is not necessarily permanent. It may be cancelled or\r\nchanged in any way by the maker before his death, or a new will\r\ncan be made.\r\n\r\nThe last will cancels all preceding wills.\r\n\r\nAn addition to an existing will is known as a \"codicil.\"\r\n\r\nA man making a will is called a testator.\r\n\r\nA woman making a will is called a testatrix.\r\n\r\nLIMITATIONS OF WILLS\r\n\r\nA man has a right to dispose of his property by will or gift as he\r\nchooses, but if he is married the law compels him to consider the\r\nrights of another.\r\n\r\nThe husband cannot, by will or otherwise, deprive his wife of her\r\n\"right of dower\" in his real estate and appurtenances.\r\n\r\nUnless she chooses to accept, the wife need not accept other\r\nproperty that is bequeathed her in lieu of dower.\r\n\r\nThe wife's dower interest in her husband's estate is a life\r\ninterest only. On her death it goes to the husband's heirs, as if\r\nthere had been no widow.\r\n\r\nIn some states there is no right of dower.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A WILL\r\n\r\nThe will not only shows the purpose of the testator, but it serves\r\nas a bar to litigation among the natural heirs.\r\n\r\nAny man or woman can write out his or her will, but unless quite\r\nfamiliar with such work it is better to employ a lawyer for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe person named in the will to carry out the purpose of the\r\ntestator is known as the \"executor\".\r\n\r\nNo person, not twenty-one at the time the will is proved can act\r\nas an executor.\r\n\r\nNeither a convict, an imbecile, nor one known to be a drug fiend\r\nor an habitual drunkard, is eligible for the post of an executor.\r\nIf an executor be appointed against his will, the law does not\r\ncompel him to serve.\r\n\r\nThere must be at least two witnesses to a will, some states\r\nrequire three.\r\n\r\nThe witnesses need not know the contents of the will, but they\r\nmust understand before signing that it is a will, and they must\r\nsee it signed by the testator.\r\n\r\nUnder the common law the will is void if the witnesses are\r\nbeneficiaries.\r\n\r\nIn some states a will so witnessed is valid, except that the\r\nwitnesses cannot receive their legacies.\r\n\r\nAll the witnesses should sign at the same time and add their\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\nIf an heir at law, say a child, is not mentioned in the will, the\r\nlaw assumes that he was forgotten by the testator and generally\r\ngives the share the heir would be entitled to if there were no\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the will the testator, in the presence of the\r\nwitnesses, should write his name in full.\r\n\r\nAN EXECUTOR'S DUTIES\r\n\r\nAn executor is the legal representative of the testator. It is his\r\nduty to see that the provisions of the will are carried out.\r\n\r\nNo man is qualified to act as executor who is not competent to\r\nmake a will. Executors, unless relieved by the provisions of the\r\nwill, are required to file bonds, proportioned to the value of the\r\nestate, for the faithful performance of their duties.\r\n\r\nShould there be no executor named in the will, or if the person so\r\nnamed refuses to act, or if he dies or resigns, the court will\r\nappoint a person to act in his place.\r\n\r\nThe executor appointed by the court is known or called an\r\n\"administrator with the will annexed.\"\r\n\r\nIn some states the court having jurisdiction of wills and estates\r\nof deceased is known as \"the probate,\" in others it is called the\r\n\"Surrogate's Court,\" and in still others, \"The Orphan's.\"\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATORS AND THEIR DUTIES\r\n\r\nIf a man, owning property, dies without making a will, the judge\r\nof the proper court will appoint an administrator to settle the\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThis is the method of procedure:\r\n\r\n1. A person, interested in getting the estate settled, goes before\r\nthe proper judge and asks him to appoint an administrator.\r\n2. The administrator must give the same bond as an executor. Their\r\nduties are the same.\r\n3. In settling the estate the administrator is governed by the\r\nlaw, and by the special directions of the officer having\r\njurisdiction in such matters.\r\n4. He must make a careful list of all the property belonging to\r\nthe estate. The value of the personal property is estimated by men\r\nspecially appointed by the court for the purpose and known as\r\n\"appraisers\".\r\n5. The administrator must account for every item of property that\r\ncomes into his possession.\r\n6. All debts of deceased must be first paid, including funeral\r\nexpenses. If the proceeds of the personal property are not\r\nsufficient for this purpose, the administrator may, if there be\r\nreal estate, sell the whole or part of it, on an order from the\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nDEBTS\r\n\r\nDebts must be paid in an order prescribed by law. The following is\r\nthe usual order:\r\n\r\n1. Funeral expenses and expenses of last illness.\r\n2. The widow's allowance or award.\r\n3. Debts due the state or municipality.\r\n4. Claims of other creditors.\r\n\r\nWhatever property is left, after paying these obligatory sums, is\r\ndivided among the rightful heirs under the direction of the court,\r\nand in the manner provided by law.\r\n\r\nThe administrator must advertise, in one or more county papers the\r\nfact that he has been appointed to settle the estate of the\r\ndeceased, whose name is given, and he must ask that all claims be\r\npresented within a given period, usually fixed at six months.\r\n\r\nWhen the estate is settled to the satisfaction of the court, the\r\nsame authority releases the administrator and his bondsmen.\r\n\r\nAll the fees connected with the settlement are regarded as debts\r\nand must be paid from the proceeds of the estate before closing.\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL SETTLEMENT\r\n\r\nWhen the debts are paid and the residue divided among the heirs,\r\nthe administrator files his account. If it is allowed the case\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThe parties of interest in an estate may agree to settle it out of\r\ncourt. This saves expense, but it is not the safest way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLETTER WRITING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat has been said about deeds and mortgages applies not only to\r\nthe farmer, but also to every owner of a building lot. The same\r\nmay be said of wills. They have a business interest for the town\r\nas well as for the country dweller.\r\n\r\nBUSINESS LETTERS\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this book being \"strictly business,\" no attempt\r\nwill be made to instruct the reader in anything not connected with\r\nthe subject under consideration.\r\n\r\nSocial, friendly, and such letters are matters for individual time\r\nand taste, and no rule can be laid down for their writing, but the\r\nbusiness letter is a different matter, and one which deserves\r\nspecial consideration from every man or woman who receives an\r\norder by mail, or who sends one.\r\n\r\nTo write a good business letter is no mean accomplishment, and\r\nalthough a gift with some, it can be acquired by all.\r\n\r\nA letter is, in a way, a testimonial of the character and ability\r\nof the writer.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of a business letter is to express just what you want\r\nand no more.\r\n\r\nAny man with a good common school education, and a little patient\r\npractice, can soon learn to write as good a business letter as the\r\ncollege graduate.\r\n\r\nCorrect spelling may not be general, but it is certainly\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nLetter writing, as in the preparation of other papers, has its own\r\nwell-recognized forms, and these may be easily learned.\r\n\r\nEvery properly constructed business letter should consist of the\r\nfollowing parts:\r\n\r\n  1. Where written from.\r\n  2. When written.\r\n  3. To whom written.\r\n  4. Address.\r\n  5. Salutation.\r\n  6. Introduction.\r\n  7. Purpose of letter.\r\n  8. Complimentary ending.\r\n  9. Signature.\r\n\r\nTHE HEADING\r\n\r\nThe letter should begin by giving the address of the writer,\r\nfollowed by the date on which it was written. This will enable the\r\nrecipient to direct his reply.\r\n\r\nIf from a city, the street and number should be given.\r\n\r\nIf many letters are written it will be convenient to have the\r\npermanent address of the writer printed.\r\n\r\nThe writing should be plain, and there should be no doubt in the\r\nmind of the reader as to the proper spelling of the address and\r\nsignature.\r\n\r\nAvoid the hieroglyphics which some vain men adopt in signing their\r\nnames. It may be fanciful, but it does not imply consideration for\r\nthe time and patience of strangers.\r\n\r\nThe following forms will serve to illustrate the type of heading\r\nused in ordinary business letters:\r\n\r\n                     1\r\n\r\n     124 Smith St., Brownsville, Mass.\r\n                      September 4, 1910.\r\nMr. John Smith,\r\n  Doylestown, Penna.\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\n                     2\r\n\r\n                        Leroy, Mass.,\r\n                     September 5, 1910.\r\nMessrs. Brown and Jones,\r\n  Denver, Col.\r\nGentlemen:\r\n\r\n                     3\r\n\r\n  4 Seminole St., Fort Smith, Ark.\r\n                  September 6, 1910.\r\nMrs. Mary J. Robinson,\r\n  Lansing, Cal.\r\nDear Madam:\r\n\r\nThe \"Mr.,\" \"Mrs.,\" \"Madam,\" and \"Miss\" are titles of courtesy and\r\nshould not be omitted. The abbreviation \"Esq.\" for Esquire is\r\nsometimes used; but the two titles Mr. and Esq. should never be\r\nused with one name, as \"Mr. John Smith, Esq.\"\r\n\r\nIf a man is known by a military or other title, always use it, but\r\nnever precede it with \"Mr.\" nor follow it with \"Esq.\"\r\n\r\nClergymen should always be addressed as \"Rev.,\" the abbreviation\r\nfor Reverend. If he is a doctor of divinity, add D.D. to the name,\r\nas \"Rev. John Smith, D.D.\"\r\n\r\nMedical doctors may be addressed as \"Dr. John Smith,\" or \"John\r\nSmith, M.D.\"\r\n\r\nTHE GREETING\r\n\r\nThe greeting or salutation is a term of courtesy or esteem used in\r\naddressing the one to whom the letter is sent.\r\n\r\n\"Sir\" is the formal greeting, and is used in addressing officials,\r\nor any strange male person. \"Sirs,\" or \"Gentlemen\" may be used in\r\nthe plural. \"Dear Sir,\" or \"My Dear Sir,\" is the usual form of\r\ngreeting when a business letter is addressed to an individual.\r\n\r\nWhere the writer is acquainted with the person addressed, the\r\nusual form of greeting is \"Dear Mr. Smith.\"\r\n\r\nTHE LETTER ITSELF\r\n\r\nIf writing in response to a letter received, the writer should\r\nbegin in some such way as this:\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas Brown,\r\n  Newburg, N. Y.\r\nMy Dear Sir:\r\n\r\n  Your favor of the second inst. is just to hand. In reply permit\r\nme to state, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThis should be followed by the necessary statement, set forth in\r\nclear, simple words.\r\n\r\nBe sure of yourself.\r\n\r\nThe secret of good writing is clear thinking.\r\n\r\nENDING THE LETTER\r\n\r\nThere is much in the proper ending of a letter. In the ordinary\r\nbusiness letter the usual ending may be, \"Yours truly,\" \"Yours\r\nvery truly,\" or \"Yours respectfully.\" Other endings used in\r\nwriting to business acquaintances are, \"Yours sincerely,\" or \"Very\r\nsincerely yours,\" or you may substitute the words \"Cordially\" or\r\n\"Heartily\" for \"sincerely.\"\r\n\r\nSIGNING THE LETTER\r\n\r\nThe name of the writer should be so clear and distinct as to leave\r\nno doubt as to the spelling.\r\n\r\nThe name should always be written in the same way.\r\n\r\nIf your name is George W. Brown, do not write it at one time as\r\nhere given, and again as G. Washington Brown, or G. W. Brown.\r\n\r\nAdopt one form and stick to it.\r\n\r\nIf you are writing for a firm or for another as clerk or\r\nsecretary, always sign the firm name, and below it your own name\r\npreceded by the word \"per,\" meaning \"by\" or \"through.\"\r\n\r\nTHE MATERIALS\r\n\r\nNever use scraps of paper or soiled paper to write on if better\r\ncan be had. The materials of a letter affect the receiver,\r\nparticularly if a stranger, just as one is affected by the garb of\r\na stranger before he speaks.\r\n\r\nUse a good pen and black ink.\r\n\r\nFold your paper so that it will fit the envelope.\r\n\r\nAvoid blots and erasures; they indicate carelessness or unbecoming\r\nhaste.\r\n\r\nAddress your letter distinctly.\r\n\r\nHere is a good form:\r\n\r\n       Mr. George W. White,\r\n                        Boston,\r\n1101 Sioux St.             Mass.\r\n\r\nLETTERS OF INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nAt some time or another one has to write a letter of introduction,\r\nand sometimes he has had to pay for it.\r\n\r\nIf you should give such a letter to a man to introduce him to\r\nanother with whom you trade, the law has held that the introducer\r\nis responsible for any reasonable bills the introduced may\r\ncontract with the receiver of the letter.\r\n\r\nNever give a letter of introduction to a man you are not sure of.\r\n\r\nIn addressing a letter of introduction which is to be handed in\r\nperson, do it in this way:\r\n\r\n         Mr. George W. Brown,\r\n                   Washington, D. C.\r\n  Introducing\r\n      Mr. Henry Wilson.\r\n\r\nThis shows on its face the nature of the communication.\r\n\r\nHere is a good form:\r\n\r\n       111 Payne Ave., Montrose, Ill.\r\n                    September 27, 1910.\r\nMr. Norman R. Lloyd,\r\n  Chicago, Ill.\r\nDear Mr. Lloyd:\r\n\r\n     This will introduce my esteemed\r\nfriend Mr. Thomas T. Fletcher, of this\r\ntown. Mr. Fletcher contemplates opening\r\na drug store in Chicago. Should he do so\r\nhe will prove an acquisition to your City.\r\nAny favor you can render him will be much\r\nappreciated by,\r\n             Yours faithfully,\r\n                     George W. Brown.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\nEvery man of standing and every employer of labor is at times\r\ncalled on to certify to the character, or to give a testimonial to\r\nsome esteemed employee who is about to seek his fortune in another\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nIf you are about to hire a stranger, it adds to your confidence\r\nand to his chances if he have a testimonial as to character and\r\nfitness from his last employer, or from some man whose word you\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe letter of recommendation is usually of a general character and\r\nnot addressed to any particular. It should open in this way:\r\n\r\n\"To whom it may concern.\"\r\n\r\nFollow this with your testimonial and sign it.\r\n\r\nTITLES\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States is addressed as:\r\n\"His Excellency,\"\r\n  William H. Taft,\r\n    Executive Mansion,\r\n      Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nCabinet officers, Senators, Congressmen, members of the\r\nLegislature, and Mayors of cities are usually addressed as \"Hon.,\"\r\nthe abbreviation of honorable.\r\n\r\nThe title \"Hon.\" like \"Esq.\" is often misused. After all titles of\r\ncourtesy are not obligatory, unless we regard the unwritten law of\r\ncustom in such matters as binding.\r\n\r\nThe very best kind of a letter, and perhaps the hardest to write,\r\nis that in which the writer appears to be talking to us face to\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBILLS, RECEIPTS AND ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to understand clearly the meaning of all the business terms\r\nyou have to use.\r\n\r\nThe terms \"bill\" and \"invoice\" usually mean the same thing, that\r\nis, a \"bill of sale.\" This applies to goods sold, or services\r\nrendered.\r\n\r\nThe merchant sends you an itemized invoice of the goods you\r\nordered and he has shipped.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter sends you an itemized bill of the work done by your\r\norder.\r\n\r\nSuch a document should be regarded not as a \"dun,\" but rather as a\r\nrecord of the contract or transaction.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing case the merchant and the carpenter are the\r\ncreditors, the recipient of the goods or work is the debtor.\r\n\r\nBILLS FOR GOODS\r\n\r\nIn writing out a bill the date is the first thing to be\r\nconsidered. This should be the same in form as a business letter.\r\n\r\nThis form will serve as an illustration:\r\n\r\n                    Glenwood, N. J.\r\n                     October 1, 1910.\r\nRobert Brown\r\n  To George L. White, Dr.\r\nSept 2. For 25 lbs. sugar, at .06 . . .$1.50\r\n  \"  6.  \"  30 lbs. ham, at .20 . . . . 6.00\r\n  \" 14.  \" 100 lbs. flour, at .03-1/2 . 3.50\r\n                                        ----\r\n           Received payment,          $11.00\r\n\r\nSIGNATURE ON PAYMENT\r\n\r\nWholesale houses send such bills as soon as the goods are shipped\r\nor delivered, though the payment, as per agreement, is not to be\r\nmade for thirty, sixty or ninety days.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a running account, that is, frequent orders, with\r\ntotal payments never completed, it is customary for the seller, at\r\nthe beginning of a calendar month to send to the creditor a\r\n\"statement.\" This statement does not repeat the items of the bills\r\nrendered, its purpose being to show the balance due to date.\r\n\r\nBILLS FOR LABOR\r\n\r\nWhere a mechanic or laborer is employed by the day at a fixed\r\nwage, the length of time and dates should be given.\r\n\r\n                         Richmond, Va.\r\n                       November 3, 1910.\r\nCharles M. Pratt,\r\n   To John Smith, Dr.\r\n     To 4 days, from Oct. 1st to 4th\r\n       inclusive, at $2.00..........$8.00\r\n     To 2 1/2 days, Oct. 10th, 11th\r\n       and 12th....................  5.00\r\n     To 3 days, Oct. 17th, 18th and\r\n       19th .......................  6.00\r\n                                    ------\r\n           Received payment,        $19.00\r\n                            Signature.\r\n\r\nThis bill is just as transferable as a mortgage. If for any reason\r\nMr. Smith should decide to sell it, say to Robert Brown, he should\r\nmake the following endorsement across the back:\r\n\r\n  \"In consideration of ------ dollars, the\r\nreceipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I\r\ndo hereby sell and assign to Robert Brown,\r\nthe written account, which is justly due\r\nfrom the within named Charles W. Pratt,\r\nand I hereby authorize the said Robert\r\nBrown to collect the same.\r\n                        \"John Smith.\"\r\n\"Newburg, N. Y.\r\n   November 1, 1910.\"\r\n\r\nRegarded simply from a business viewpoint and without considering\r\nethics, \"Honesty is the best policy.\"\r\n\r\nBills, where possible, should be promptly paid.\r\n\r\nPrompt payment is a guarantee of credit and credit is the heart if\r\nnot the soul of business.\r\n\r\nNever, if it can be avoided, buy goods on the installment plan.\r\n\r\nBe sure to get a receipt for all payments you make, and be equally\r\nsure to keep the receipt where you can find it.\r\n\r\nExamine all bills and invoices; compare them with the goods\r\nreceived, and no matter what your faith in the seller's care and\r\nhonesty, calculate for yourself the price of each item, and be\r\nsure that the total is correct.\r\n\r\nDISCOUNT IN TRADE\r\n\r\nIt is a business custom, when a bill is paid before it is due, to\r\nallow a discount. This may be the legal rate of interest, or any\r\npercentage agreed on in advance.\r\n\r\nSometimes wholesale merchants or manufacturers grant esteemed\r\ncustomers, in consideration of prompt payments, a discount from\r\nthe regular prices. This is known as \"trade discount.\"\r\n\r\nWe often read of two or more discounts. A store keeper buys a bill\r\nof goods for $350 and is granted 20% and 5% from the selling\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean a discount of 25% as the uninitiated might\r\nthink. The 20% is deducted from the $350, that is, $70, leaving\r\n$280. Then the 5%, $14, is deducted from this, leaving $260.\r\n\r\nPartial payments are not endorsed on the bill. The receipt is\r\nwritten on a separate piece of paper. It differs from the usual\r\nreceipt in that the one is \"in full payment\" and the other \"on\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\nReceipt no bill before it is actually paid.\r\n\r\nSome one has translated the letters \"C. O.

Long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWHO SHOULD KEEP ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo have any value, business accounts, whether of a great or a\r\nsmall concern, must be accurately kept.\r\n\r\nEvery man and woman, having unsettled dealings with others, should\r\nkeep some sort of book accounts.\r\n\r\nStorekeepers must keep accounts, and every farmer and mechanic,\r\nwho would know just what he owns and what he has spent during the\r\npast month and year, should keep an exact account of every cent\r\nreceived and paid out.\r\n\r\nLawyers and doctors know how to keep accounts, or if they do not\r\nthey are neglecting their own side of their professional duties.\r\n\r\nWorkers, skilled and unskilled, and even the hired girl who is\r\npaid by the month, should keep a record of the compensation\r\nreceived, and how the whole or the part has been expended.\r\n\r\nNo woman can be called a really good housekeeper who does not know\r\nto a penny what has become of the money she has received for the\r\nupkeep of her establishment, whether she have a score of servants\r\nor does all her own work.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep such accounts, as have just been indicated, it is\r\nnot necessary to be a trained bookkeeper, or to know anything more\r\nabout the art than a good common school education gives.\r\n\r\nAnother word as to the farmer. I am not thinking in this\r\nconnection of the old-time, deep-in-the-ruts farmer, who never\r\nlearns and knows nothing to forget, but of that wide-awake\r\nproducer who tries to keep up with the times.\r\n\r\nNot only should the farmer keep cash accounts, the form may be\r\nquite simple, but all his business affairs should be kept in the\r\nbest possible trim.\r\n\r\nPersonal agreements without some kind of writing to back them up,\r\nare dangerous.\r\n\r\nVerbal contracts feed the lawyers.\r\n\r\nAll transactions involving labor or money should be recorded in\r\nblack and white.\r\n\r\nDon't trust to your memory.\r\n\r\nDon't rely on the memory of another.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT WITH CROPS\r\n\r\nEvery farmer should keep an account with each crop he raises and\r\neven with every field he cultivates.\r\n\r\nAgainst the farm should be charged--\r\n\r\n1. Its annual rental value.\r\n2. What all the labor would cost if hired.\r\n3. New machinery.\r\n4. Wear, tear and repair of old machinery.\r\n5. Taxes.\r\n6. Insurance.\r\n7. Doctor's bills.\r\n8. Interest on mortgage if any.\r\n9. The cost of fodder, fuel, etc., consumed.\r\n\r\nThe farm should be credited with--\r\n\r\n1. The rent.\r\n2. The cost of everything produced and consumed on place.\r\n3. The farm products sold.\r\n4. The stock sold.\r\n5. Increased value of stock.\r\n6. Increased value of property, if any.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch accounts you say will cause trouble; well, you cannot do\r\nanything of value without trouble. The question is will the effort\r\npay? Those who keep such accounts say it does, and they are\r\nusually the successful, progressive farmers.\r\n\r\nWORKING-MEN'S ACCOUNTS\r\n\r\nThe working man, skilled or unskilled, and the working man's wife\r\nas well, should keep some form of cash book that will show from\r\nweek to week the receipts and expenditures.\r\n\r\nOne can be thrifty without being miserly.\r\n\r\nWhere did the money go?\r\n\r\nLook at your book, where every cent expended has been set down,\r\nand you will be surprised to find how the little sums total up.\r\n\r\nLook over the list of little things bought and you will be\r\nsurprised to see how many were not needed.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple form for a home record:\r\n\r\n             Cash Received\r\n1910.\r\nJan. 2. Balance on hand.........$45.50\r\n  \"  3. Work for Mr. Jones....... 1.75\r\n  \"  3. Smith paid bill......... 13.75\r\n  \"  9. Work for Mr. Brown....... 7.50\r\n\r\n             Cash Paid\r\n1910.\r\nJan. 2. Two shirts...............$1.50\r\n  \"  3. To wife for house........ 8.50\r\n  \"  4. Doctor C's. bill......... 6.00\r\n  \"  5. Fare to Troy............. 2.25\r\n  \"  6. Horse car................  .20\r\n  \"  6. Postage..................  .06\r\n  \"  7. Church Contribution...... 1.00\r\n  \"  8. Shoes mended............. 0.60\r\n  \"  9. Newspaper bill........... 1.00\r\n\r\n\r\nNever \"lump\" what you receive or what you spend.\r\n\r\nSet down each item separately, even to one cent.\r\n\r\nWhen you have filled out each page of \"received\" and \"paid\" foot\r\nit up and carry it to the next page set apart for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAn account book will cost but a few cents. Use the left-hand side\r\nfor receipts and the right for expenditures.\r\n\r\nAt any time the excess of the left hand over the right should show\r\nthe amount on hand.\r\n\r\nStrike a balance at least once a month.\r\n\r\nOTHER RECORDS\r\n\r\nNever mix up another's accounts with your own.\r\n\r\nJohn Smith, treasurer of some church, society, or club, is a\r\ndifferent person before the law from John Smith, the trader or\r\nmechanic.\r\n\r\nFunds not your own, and which may be added to or decreased from\r\ntime to time, as in the case of a society, say like the Odd\r\nFellows, should be kept in the bank not as John Smith's but as the\r\nfunds of \"John Smith, Treasurer of Washington Lodge 110,\r\nIndependent Order of Odd Fellows,\" or whatever the name of the\r\nsociety, club, or church may be.\r\n\r\nIn the same way, \"a treasurer's book\" should be kept and all the\r\nreceipts and expenditures carefully recorded.\r\n\r\nCOPIES\r\n\r\nIf a business proposition is made to another by mail, or if you\r\nhand another in writing your proposition as to a certain contract\r\nyou are willing to undertake, for the consideration named, be sure\r\nto keep a copy of the letter or contract; such a precaution may\r\nsave trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nAS TO BANKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo instrument of trade has done so much or is more essential to\r\nthe safe and progressive business of the world today than the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nEvery department of business, in our modern civilization, must\r\nkeep in touch with the bank.\r\n\r\nMoney is the blood of trade and the banking system is its heart.\r\n\r\nThe bank is as necessary to the thrifty farmer as it is to the\r\ngreatest railroad or the most wide-spread trust.\r\n\r\nBanks are depositories for money not in circulation.\r\n\r\nBanks have facilities for the safe-guarding of money which the\r\nordinary business man could not provide for himself.\r\n\r\nInstead of running the risk of paying bills with money carried\r\nabout on his person, the business man, and every man with ready\r\nmoney should follow his example, deposits his money in a\r\nconvenient bank, for which he receives a proper voucher in the\r\nshape of a credit in a deposit book.\r\n\r\nWhen he pays a bill, he draws a check for the amount, payable to\r\nthe order of his creditor. This check, when endorsed by the\r\nreceiver and paid by the bank, is in itself a receipt for the\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL BANKS\r\n\r\nAs I propose to say something about savings banks in another\r\nchapter, the present will be devoted to what are known as \"banks\r\nof deposit.\"\r\n\r\nBanks of deposit are either National, State, or private.\r\n\r\nA National bank is, as the name implies, chartered and\r\nincorporated by the Government, with special privileges and\r\nrestrictions.\r\n\r\nThe Government in the organizing of National banks had in mind the\r\nprotection of the public without unduly limiting the profit of the\r\nstockholders.\r\n\r\nThe sum the stockholders must contribute to the establishment of a\r\nNational bank varies according to the population and the business\r\nimportance of the place in which the bank is to be located.\r\n\r\nThe capital must exist in a prescribed form.\r\n\r\nCertain forms of investment are prohibited, as for instance the\r\nownership of real estate, except under certain restrictions.\r\n\r\nThis is done that the National bank may be able to convert its\r\nsecurities into cash in the shortest order.\r\n\r\nIn consideration of a prescribed amount of United States bonds,\r\ndeposited with the Treasury in Washington, the Government issues\r\nto the National bank a prescribed sum in printed bank notes of\r\nvarying denominations.\r\n\r\nIf the bank should close for any reason, the bank notes or their\r\nequivalent must be returned, when the bonds deposited as security\r\nare released.\r\n\r\nEvery bank must have a board of directors, a president and a\r\ncashier. Receiving and paying tellers, with bookkeepers, and many\r\nclerks are necessary to carry on the business of a large bank.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the National banks are under the supervision of\r\nregularly appointed Government inspectors.\r\n\r\nA National bank may fail, but its notes are still \"as good as\r\ngold.\"\r\n\r\nBANKS AS LENDERS\r\n\r\nThe bank not only receives money on deposit, but it loans money\r\nunder certain conditions.\r\n\r\nMany merchants, builders, contractors and others often find it\r\nnecessary to borrow money in order to carry on their business\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nIf a man's business reputation is good, and the banks keep well\r\nposted in such matters, he may secure a loan on his own note,\r\nthough even in such cases the name of a good endorser is required.\r\n\r\nIf in addition to his note the borrower can offer security in the\r\nway of bonds of good character, or other reliable collateral, he\r\ncan usually be accommodated.\r\n\r\nOf course, the banks charge interest for loans. They also make\r\ncollections on notes and other commercial paper and they issue\r\nforeign and domestic bills of exchange.\r\n\r\nEvery man with a sum large or small in excess of his expenditures,\r\nshould open a bank account. Even if not in business this will\r\nencourage thrift and lead to good business habits.\r\n\r\nINTEREST ON DEPOSITS\r\n\r\nSome banks, particularly those known as \"state\" or \"private,\" and\r\nNational banks in smaller communities, allow interest on deposits.\r\nThis interest varies with the demand for money, but in the eastern\r\nstates it seldom goes over four per cent.\r\n\r\nIt is well to know when interest begins and ends.\r\n\r\nIf the dates set by the bank for reckoning interest are the first\r\nday of January, April, July and October, money deposited March\r\n31st will begin to draw interest next day, but if deposited April\r\n2nd, it would not begin to draw interest till July 1st.\r\n\r\nBut if you have the money and would insure its safety, deposit it\r\nat once regardless of time or interest.\r\n\r\nIf a depositor withdraws his money before the day when interest is\r\ndue, he forfeits the interest. But banks vary as to that.\r\n\r\nCHECK AND DEPOSIT BOOKS\r\n\r\nEvery depositor is given a book in which the teller or cashier\r\ncredits him on the left-hand side with the amount deposited. Other\r\ndeposits are treated in the same way, and at proper times, if\r\ninterest is allowed, it is added as a deposit.\r\n\r\nThe depositor can provide his own check book, and have it printed\r\nin any color he pleases, with the name of himself and business on\r\nthe margin. The bank, however, will supply loose bank checks of\r\nits own, or it may provide them in book form, with stubs, or a\r\nspace on which the number, amount and purpose of the check may be\r\nnoted for the drawer's information.\r\n\r\n\"Writing up\" of the deposit book is leaving it with the proper\r\nofficer at the bank--a receipt for the book is never taken. It is\r\nreturned with all the checks received, and their amount footed up\r\non the right hand or debit page, and the balance on hand shown.\r\n\r\nEvery depositor should know from the record on the check stubs\r\nexactly how his account stands with the bank.\r\n\r\nTake care that you do not overdraw.\r\n\r\nKeep your own record of your own money.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL DEPOSIT BANKS\r\n\r\nIn the Commercial banks of our large cities no interest is\r\nallowed, nor could it be easily calculated where a score of\r\ndeposits may be made in a week and a hundred checks drawn in a\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe depositor in such a bank is free to check out his funds as he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nBefore opening an account there is more than money needed from the\r\ndepositor. If unknown, he must satisfy the bank of his character,\r\nwhich is best done through the introduction of one known to both.\r\n\r\nSome banks make a charge for deposits, where a man makes a\r\nconvenience of them by depositing money which he checks out in a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nA depositor, when opening an account with a bank is required to\r\nplace his signature in a book kept for the purpose. Until the bank\r\nofficer, the paying teller, becomes familiar with the signature on\r\nthe check, he verifies it by comparing it with that in the book.\r\n\r\nHOW TO PREPARE A CHECK\r\n\r\nA check may be defined to be \"a written order on a bank directing\r\nit to pay a certain sum of money to the person named in the check\r\nor to his order, and signed by a depositor.\"\r\n\r\nSo long as the purpose is clearly conveyed in the writing no\r\nparticular form of words is necessary, nor need the paper on which\r\nthe check is written be the regular printed form properly filled\r\nin.\r\n\r\nThe \"drawer\" is the one who makes the check.\r\n\r\nThe \"payee\" is the one for whom the check is made.\r\n\r\nIn making a check, the best plan is to fill out the stub first,\r\nand from the data on it make out the check. This tends to\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nBe sure to number your check, beginning with I.\r\n\r\nBe sure that the number on the stub is the same as on the check.\r\n\r\nA person having money in bank and wishing to draw for his own use,\r\nmakes his check payable to \"self\" or to \"cash.\"\r\n\r\nUsual form of check:\r\n\r\n           First National Bank.   No. 27\r\n            Kingston, Vt., Oct. 13, 1910.\r\n      Pay to order of John Smith\r\n      Seventy-five 75/100  ------ dollars.\r\n      $75.75               George F. Brown.\r\n\r\nIt is proper form to specify on the face of the check the purpose\r\nfor which it is given, but while this is permissible it is not\r\nusual.\r\n\r\nWrite the amount of the check first in words then in figures. This\r\nmakes more certain the amount.\r\n\r\nAlways begin first word of amount close to left-hand side of\r\ncheck; when the whole sum is written down draw a heavy stroke\r\nalong the line to the word \"dollars.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a check is made payable to John Smith or order, John Smith\r\nmust sign his name on the back of the check--left-hand end and\r\nabout an inch from the top.\r\n\r\nNever sign a check until you are ready to collect, or to bank it.\r\n\r\nThe payee can endorse the check to another by writing on the back\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n      Pay to the order of\r\n               Thomas Brown.\r\n                            John Smith.\r\n\r\nA check payable to \"bearer\" may be negotiated by any one. When\r\nsuch checks are presented by a stranger, at the bank of the maker,\r\nthe paying teller always insists that the stranger be identified.\r\n\r\nNever make a check payable to \"bearer\" if it can be avoided.\r\n\r\nSometimes checks are dated ahead, for reasons satisfactory to the\r\nmaker and payee.\r\n\r\nA check drawn on August 5th, but dated August 20th cannot be\r\ncollected till the latter date.\r\n\r\nNever date a check ahead unless you are positive that you will\r\nhave the money in bank to meet it on the day named.\r\n\r\nNever, if you can avoid it in trade, receive a post-dated check.\r\n\r\nCash or deposit your checks as soon as possible after they are\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nIf the bank should fail, while you are holding the check, the\r\nmaker cannot be held for the loss.\r\n\r\nCERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT\r\n\r\nOften when a depositor is travelling, he finds it convenient to\r\ncarry with him a form of paper that is as good as cash, and much\r\nbetter in the event of loss.\r\n\r\nBanks will issue \"certified checks\" to depositors. These checks\r\nare stamped by the bank \"certified\" with the date and officer's\r\nsignature attached.\r\n\r\nOn issuing such a check, the bank debits the receiver's account\r\nwith the amount, and so can guarantee the payment whenever or\r\nwherever presented.\r\n\r\nSuch a check may be received with as much certainty of its value\r\nas if it were a bank bill.\r\n\r\nWhen a person places money in a bank with no intention of checking\r\nit out for some time to come, he may have issued to him a\r\n\"Certificate of deposit.\"\r\n\r\nWhile holding this certificate he cannot check against the money\r\nin the bank.\r\n\r\nThe holder of a certificate of deposit may transfer it.\r\n\r\nThe money may be paid in part by the bank, if the certificate is\r\npresented, and the amount is endorsed on the back.\r\n\r\nTo withdraw all the money the certificate must be surrendered.\r\n\r\nUSE OF CHECKS\r\n\r\nThere is no form of commercial paper in such general use as the\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe total of all the checks in use at some seasons is far more\r\nthan the total of all the money in all the banks.\r\n\r\nChecks are balanced in the money centers through what are known as\r\nclearing houses. In these a bank is charged with checks against it\r\nand credited with those in its favor.\r\n\r\nThe differences are settled by cash.\r\n\r\nOften a few thousand dollars will settle check accounts amounting\r\nto millions.\r\n\r\nIf by any chance you should receive a check in which your name is\r\nmisspelled, or not given as you write it, endorse the check\r\nexactly as the name is written on the face, then add your name in\r\nthe regular way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSAVINGS BANKS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile of National importance, savings banks are chartered by the\r\nrespective states in which they exist, and as such are distinctly\r\nlocal institutions.\r\n\r\nUnlike the National, the savings bank is not established as a\r\nmoney-making corporation.\r\n\r\nThe ostensible and actual purpose of the savings bank is to\r\nencourage people of small means to save.\r\n\r\nThe savings bank provides a safe place for the care of such\r\ndeposits, and it pays such rates of interest on such deposits as\r\nare warranted by the earnings of its investments after paying the\r\nexpenses incident to the proper conduct of its officers.\r\n\r\nWhen a savings bank receives authorization to act, through a\r\ncharter from the state, the organizers choose a board of directors\r\nand the proper officers.\r\n\r\nUsually the officers occupying positions of trust and\r\nresponsibility are required to give bonds for the proper discharge\r\nof their duties.\r\n\r\nHOW BUSINESS IS CONDUCTED\r\n\r\nWith all the legal conditions complied with, and a suitable office\r\nprovided, the savings bank is ready for business.\r\n\r\nSome savings banks will receive on deposit any sum from five cents\r\nto five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nOther banks will not receive less than one dollar at a time, nor\r\nmore than a thousand.\r\n\r\nWe have heard of \"penny savings banks,\" but they are rarely\r\nchartered, and are organized, only to encourage thrift among\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nFractional parts of a dollar are not usually reckoned as drawing\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nSome banks require as much as three, four or five dollars before\r\nallowing interest.\r\n\r\nSavings banks in the eastern states pay from three to four per\r\ncent. In the west it is sometimes as high as six.\r\n\r\nEach bank has certain dates at which calculation of interest\r\nbegins. As a rule this is January 1st, April 1st, July 1st, and\r\nOctober 1st.\r\n\r\nMoney deposited at any time between these dates does not draw\r\ninterest till the beginning of the next quarter.\r\n\r\nBut never mind the interest.\r\n\r\nThe best time to make a deposit is when you have the money.\r\n\r\nThe bank is safer than your pocket.\r\n\r\nHOW TO DEPOSIT\r\n\r\nCount your money carefully and make a memorandum of the amount\r\nbefore giving to the savings bank to deposit.\r\n\r\nHand the money to the officer--usually \"the receiving teller\"--\r\nauthorized to receive it.\r\n\r\nThe teller writes down the name, age, occupation and residence of\r\nthe depositor.\r\n\r\nIf money is deposited in the name of one under legal age, the\r\nnames of the parents and the birthplace of the minor are also\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nThe adult depositor must write his name in a book provided by the\r\nbank for the signature of clients.\r\n\r\nWhen these conditions are complied with, the depositor receives a\r\nmemorandum book, known as a \"deposit book\", in which, with his\r\nname and date, is written the amount of his first deposit.\r\n\r\nThe deposit book must be carefully guarded, for without its\r\npresentation at the savings bank money cannot be drawn. You cannot\r\ncheck against your savings bank account, as with a commercial\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nHOW THE ACCOUNT GROWS\r\n\r\nAfter the first account is opened the rest is easy.\r\n\r\nOn the second, as on all subsequent visits, the deposit book, with\r\nthe amount to be entered, is handed to the receiving teller. He\r\ncounts the money, makes a record of it for his own use, enters it\r\non your book as a deposit, and hands the book back. That is all.\r\n\r\nWhenever interest is due it is written down in the book as if it\r\nwere a cash deposit.\r\n\r\nThe interest, if desired, will be paid in cash, but if allowed to\r\nremain, it begins at once to earn interest for itself.\r\n\r\nInterest grows like a rolling snow ball. On such small beginnings\r\ngreat fortunes have been built.\r\n\r\nSavings banks keep a reserve, made up of earnings in excess of\r\ninterest and all expenses.\r\n\r\nThis reserve earns money.\r\n\r\nThe money so earned is reckoned as a net profit, and it may be\r\ndistributed, and usually is, among its depositors as a \"dividend.\"\r\n\r\nTHE LIMIT OF DEPOSIT\r\n\r\nDifferent banks have different limits of deposit, that is fixed\r\nsums beyond which they will not receive.\r\n\r\nThe limit is from one thousand to five thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen the fortunate depositor has reached the limit with one\r\nsavings bank, there is no law to prevent his opening another\r\naccount with another, or with any number of similar banks.\r\n\r\nRemember the savings banks are not meant for capitalists, but for\r\nsmall depositors.\r\n\r\nAfter deposits and interests have reached a total of $1,600, the\r\ninterest will not go on earning interest, but will be regarded\r\nsimply as a deposit.\r\n\r\nThis is in compliance with law.\r\n\r\nDepositors, posted as to the law, open another account with\r\nanother bank, and keep on till the interest limit is reached.\r\n\r\nHOW TO DRAW MONEY\r\n\r\nA savings bank depositor may either draw money himself or through\r\nsome properly authorized person.\r\n\r\nThis is the method:\r\n\r\nThe deposit book is presented to the paying teller. The owner\r\nstates the sum he wants to draw.\r\n\r\nHaving assured himself that the bearer of the book is the right\r\nperson, the teller takes a receipt in a book kept for the purpose,\r\nfor the amount, enters the same on the right hand or debit side of\r\nthe book, and hands out the money.\r\n\r\nThere is a form of authorization for another to draw, printed on\r\nthe deposit book. This must be copied and its directions complied\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nMost banks will not allow depositors to draw out less than a fixed\r\nsum, say $5.00.\r\n\r\nThis saves trouble, and prevents thoughtless depositors from going\r\nto the bank every time they want a dollar.\r\n\r\nBefore a depositor can draw a large sum from a savings bank he may\r\nbe compelled, under the law, to give from one week to six weeks'\r\nnotice of his intention.\r\n\r\nThis provision may not prevent a run on the bank, but it gives the\r\nmanagers time to provide for it.\r\n\r\nRead the rules in the deposit book.\r\n\r\nHOW SAVINGS BANKS EARN\r\n\r\nHow can a bank that does not discount notes or deal in loans and\r\ncommercial paper earn money? How can it pay interest?\r\n\r\nWhile they may be individually small, the aggregate of all the\r\ndeposits in a savings bank may, and often do, amount to many\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThis money is not allowed to lie idle.\r\n\r\nUnder the skilled direction of the bank officers, the money,\r\ninstead of lying idle in the vaults, is invested in many ways, but\r\nalways in accordance with the laws of the state under which the\r\nbank is chartered.\r\n\r\nMuch of the money is invested in mortgages on real estate, never\r\non personal property.\r\n\r\nNational bank stocks, sound railroad bonds, and other forms of\r\nreliable interest security are fields for the investment of\r\nsavings bank funds.\r\n\r\nSavings banks are subject to the periodic inspection of state\r\nofficers appointed for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe failure of a savings bank through bad investments or the\r\ndishonesty of officials is very rare.\r\n\r\nAvoid all banks that promise more than the regular rate of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nPrivate banks may be, and usually are, honestly conducted, but to\r\nbe safe, deposit only with a bank that is regularly chartered and\r\nis subject to the inspection of the law.\r\n\r\nThe savings bank is the best for the wage earner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nNOTES--DRAFTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promissory note is a most useful kind of commercial paper, and\r\nit is in general use in business.\r\n\r\nIf a man has not sufficient ready cash to pay for the real estate\r\nhe is about to purchase, he makes up the difference by a note,\r\nwhich note is secured by a mortgage on the property.\r\n\r\nRemember the mortgage must always be regarded as security. The\r\nnote represents the debt.\r\n\r\nOften wholesalers take a note as part or even full payment for a\r\nbill of goods to a retailer.\r\n\r\nIf the wholesaler needs money, he endorses these notes and putting\r\nthem in his bank draws against them, less the discount he has to\r\npay for the accommodation.\r\n\r\nAs has been shown, an account may be transferred and sold, but a\r\nnote is more convenient for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAN ILLUSTRATION\r\n\r\nAs with a check the maker of a note is known as a \"drawer,\" the\r\nperson in whose favor it is drawn is the \"payee.\"\r\n\r\nNotes may be written in pencil, but it is better and safer to\r\nwrite with ink on good paper.\r\n\r\nSupposing you buy a team of horses, or it may be a bill of goods,\r\nfrom John Brown, for $350.\r\n\r\nNow you have only $100 in cash. What are you to do?\r\n\r\nMr. Brown, knowing you to be reliable, says: \"That's all right,\r\nfriend Jones. You pay me the $100 cash for which I will give you a\r\nreceipt, then I will take your note for six months, payable at my\r\nbank.\"\r\n\r\nYou agree to this; pay out the money, make and deliver the note\r\nand take the property in question, which is now yours as much as\r\nit had been his before the transfer.\r\n\r\nThe following would be a legal form in which to make the note:\r\n\r\n  $250.                             Summit, N. J.\r\n                                  October 10, 1910.\r\n  Six months after date I promise to pay to\r\n  the order of John Brown..............\r\n  Two hundred and fifty ...... dollars,....\r\n  At the Lincoln National Bank of Summit\r\n  .......... Value received.\r\n                          George Jones.\r\n    No. 1. Due April 14, 1911.\r\n\r\nNow, if before the expiration of this note, you want to make a\r\npayment on it of, say, $75, you take the money to Mr. Brown, who\r\nendorses on the back of the note, \"Received on the within note\r\n$75, January 3rd.,\" if that be the date, and signs, \"John Brown.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be well to remember that while a running account may be\r\ncollected at any time, the law cannot prevent the maker of a\r\npromissory note from selling all his belongings and leaving the\r\ncountry before the note is due.\r\n\r\nDAYS OF GRACE\r\n\r\nNotes may be \"time\" notes, that is where there is a specified time\r\nfor payment, or \"demand\" notes. The latter are collectable on\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nWith the time notes \"three days grace\" are allowed after the\r\nexpiration of the date for payment. No such favor is allowed in\r\nthe case of demand notes.\r\n\r\nThese grace days do not seem businesslike. Why not add them to the\r\ndate in the note? Well, it is a custom, quite as old as the\r\ngreater part of our laws, and so it must be observed.\r\n\r\nUnder the law a note is payable at the home or business place of\r\nthe drawer, unless otherwise specified.\r\n\r\nINDORSING NOTES\r\n\r\nA note secured by a mortgage has its payment guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThe usual way of securing the payment of a note given in business\r\nis to have it endorsed with a good name across the back, as in\r\nendorsing a check.\r\n\r\nBy writing your name across the back of another man's note you\r\nannounce to all the holders of that note that you know the maker\r\nand that if he does not pay it you will.\r\n\r\nIn most states the indorser of a note cannot be held responsible\r\nfor payment, unless the holder notifies him, within twenty-four\r\nhours after the note comes due, that the maker cannot or will not\r\npay.\r\n\r\nIf an indorsed note changes hands, each indorser is responsible to\r\nall endorsers who follow him and also to the last holder of the\r\nnote.\r\n\r\nIf an indorser, that is, one into whose hands the note has come\r\nafter the first endorsement, should not wish to guarantee payment,\r\nhe writes before his name, \"Without recourse to me.\"\r\n\r\nThis is known as a \"qualified endorsement.\"\r\n\r\nA NEGOTIABLE NOTE\r\n\r\nMost notes are negotiable; that is because they may be sold, like\r\nany other personal property, or the ownership may be transferred\r\nfrom one person to another.\r\n\r\nNo note is negotiable that does not bear on its face, the words,\r\n\"Pay to bearer,\" or \"Pay to the order of,\" followed by the payee's\r\nname.\r\n\r\nJOINT NOTES\r\n\r\nWhen two persons sign a note they become jointly and individually\r\nresponsible for its payment.\r\n\r\nSuch persons are known as \"joint makers.\"\r\n\r\nIf one signs his name on the back of a note before it has been\r\nhanded to the payee, he makes himself not only an endorser, but a\r\njoint maker.\r\n\r\nIf the maker of such a note refuses to pay on the expiration of\r\ntime stated, he is liable for the amount without any notification.\r\n\r\nDISCOUNTING NOTES\r\n\r\nIf a business man borrows from a bank on his note, he must pay for\r\nthe privilege.\r\n\r\nInterest is a sum paid for the use of money.\r\n\r\nInterest is reckoned as a certain percentage yearly on the\r\nprincipal.\r\n\r\nInterest on interest is called \"compound interest\" and is unused\r\nin ordinary business transactions.\r\n\r\nInstead of collecting interest when the amount borrowed on a note\r\nis due, or deducting it from the principal in advance, it\r\ndiscounts the note at the rate agreed on and pays the rest.\r\n\r\nThis is called bank discount and its rate is variable, depending\r\non the abundance or scarcity of money.\r\n\r\nMoney is a marketable article, and the price, like that of wheat\r\nor cotton, is governed by supply and demand.\r\n\r\nINTEREST ON NOTES\r\n\r\nA note may be made payable \"with interest,\" or not, as the parties\r\nconcerned may agree.\r\n\r\nIf nothing is said about interest in the note, no interest can be\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nAgain a note may go into details and specify that \"the interest\r\nshall be ten per cent, payable semi-annually,\" provided always\r\nthat the rate shall not be higher than the legal interest of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nExcessive interest is known as \"usury.\" It invalidates all the\r\ninterest, and in some places the principal is forfeited.\r\n\r\nWhen the holder of an interest note receives interest payment he\r\nmust record the date and sum on the back of the note.\r\n\r\nPROTESTS\r\n\r\nIf a note comes due on Sunday or on a legal holiday, payment must\r\nbe made on the following day.\r\n\r\nHolidays are appointed by the separate states.\r\n\r\nThe United States recognizes no day as a holiday, except Sunday,\r\nand that is acknowledged through custom.\r\n\r\nIt is customary for banks to notify makers of notes held by them a\r\nfew days before time set for payment; but this is not required by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIf a note lies unpaid in bank the day set for payment, as soon as\r\nthe office closes for regular business the note is protested.\r\n\r\nThe protest is made before a notary public; he is usually an\r\nemployee of the bank.\r\n\r\nIn the protest formal objection is made against the breaking of\r\nthe promise, and demanding that the matter be set right by the\r\nmaker, or on his failure, by the indorser.\r\n\r\nThe indorser, who has to pay, has a claim for the amount on the\r\nmaker of the note, as he would have for money loaned or goods\r\nsold, and he can sue to collect.\r\n\r\nA note that is not paid within a fixed time is said to be\r\n\"outlawed.\"\r\n\r\nRemember the indorser of a note must be notified within twenty-\r\nfour hours of the failure of the drawer to make good.\r\n\r\nNOTICES\r\n\r\nThe object in protesting a note is to fix the liability on the\r\nendorser.\r\n\r\nIf there be more than one endorser notice of protest must be sent\r\nto all at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt is better, where possible, to serve the notices on the\r\nindorsers in person.\r\n\r\nThe payee must also be notified.\r\n\r\nACCOMMODATIONS\r\n\r\nThere is a form of note sometimes used in business which is given\r\nwithout any consideration on the part of the maker. This is known\r\nas an \"accommodation note.\"\r\n\r\nThe maker of such a note does not expect to pay it, nor does the\r\nman in whose favor it is drawn expect to do so.\r\n\r\nAn accommodation note is an instrument by the sale of which, or\r\nthrough a bank, money may be raised for immediate use.\r\n\r\nThe maker in this case is a friend who loans his name.\r\n\r\nAs there was no value received such a note could not be collected\r\nby the payee.\r\n\r\nBut if it passes into the hands of a third party, who endorses it,\r\nthen the maker of the note can be compelled to pay.\r\n\r\nA LOST NOTE\r\n\r\nA note may be lost or stolen.\r\n\r\nThe losing of a note does not release the maker from payment of\r\nthe full amount on the date and at the place named.\r\n\r\nThe loser should at once notify the maker of his loss.\r\n\r\nA man who buys, before its maturity, a lost or stolen note, may\r\ncollect the full amount from the maker, provided the note is\r\npayable to \"bearer\" and no notice of the loss has been published.\r\n\r\nWhen the maker of a lost note pays the amount to the original\r\nowner, he should receive from him what is known as a \"bond of\r\nindemnity.\"\r\n\r\nThis bond is to secure him against paying a second time.\r\n\r\nNOTES ABOUT NOTES\r\n\r\nThere are some things worth remembering about promissory notes.\r\n\r\n1. Never give one if you can pay cash.\r\n2. A note made on Sunday is worthless in some states.\r\n3. A note given under compulsion is worthless.\r\n4. Notes made by a drunken person, or obtained by any form of\r\nfraud cannot be collected under law.\r\n5. Notes bear interest only when so stated in body of note.\r\n6. The holder of a note has a legal claim against every indorser.\r\n7. Each indorser is responsible to every indorser who follows him.\r\n8. Notes are valid without reference to the kind of paper, or\r\nwhether they are written with pen or pencil.\r\n9. Losing a note does not release the maker from payment.\r\n10. If no time is set in a note for payment, it becomes due as\r\nsoon as it is made.\r\n11. Where a note is made in one state and is payable in another,\r\nit is governed by the laws of the state in which it is to be paid.\r\n12. Notes payable on demand draw no interest until after they have\r\nbeen presented for payment.\r\n13. If a note reads \"with interest\" and no rate is specified then\r\nit draws the legal interest in the state in which it was made.\r\n14. Demand notes are not entitled to days of grace.\r\n15. If no place of payment is named in a note, it should be\r\npresented to the maker personally in business hours.\r\n16. The misspelling of a word or words in no way invalidates a\r\nnote.\r\n17. If a person who cannot write makes a note his mark should be\r\nproperly witnessed.\r\n18. The makers of a joint note must be sued jointly.\r\n19. If the words and the figures in a note disagree, the words\r\ntake precedence.\r\n20. A note signed by a firm may be collected from either of the\r\npartners.\r\n21. When a payment is made on a note secured by a mortgage, the\r\namount is endorsed on the note, never on the mortgage.\r\n22. A note given by a minor is void, unless given for actual\r\nnecessities, like food and clothing.\r\n23. If a note made by a minor is acknowledged when he comes of age\r\nit is binding and collectible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA DRAFT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA draft is a written order from the first party to the second\r\nparty to pay to the third party a certain sum of money at a\r\ncertain time.\r\n\r\nThe first party is called the \"drawer.\"\r\n\r\nThe second party is the \"drawee.\"\r\n\r\nThe third party is the \"payee.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of draft.\r\n\r\nThe first is usually where the cashier of one bank, through his\r\nown check, draws on another bank for the cash difference in their\r\naccounts with each other.\r\n\r\nThe second form of draft is the most usual and is the one we shall\r\nhere consider.\r\n\r\nThe cashier's draft is always for cash and the demand is always\r\nhonored. The ordinary business draft may be for cash or for goods.\r\n\r\nThe business draft is usually honored, but there are circumstances\r\nunder which it may be ignored.\r\n\r\nTO MAKE A DRAFT\r\n\r\nBut let us suppose that the draft is all right and that a\r\nmerchant, let us call him Henry Thomas, and suppose him a resident\r\nof Philadelphia, has a bill against James Taylor, of Cleveland,\r\nand he wants to collect it, without recourse to law. How will he\r\ngo about it?\r\n\r\nThe bill is for $100.\r\n\r\nMr. Thomas writes this draft:\r\n\r\n     Philadelphia, Pa., Sept. 5, 1910.\r\n   At sight pay to the order of\r\n   Johnson National Bank of Philadelphia\r\n   One hundred................... dollars.\r\n               With exchange\r\n             and charge same to\r\n                          Henry Thomas.\r\n   To James Taylor,\r\n       Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\nHaving drawn his draft, Mr. Thomas takes it to the Johnson\r\nNational Bank for collection. The collection is actually made by\r\nsome bank in Cleveland to which the Johnson has endorsed it over.\r\n\r\nIf Mr. Thomas wished he might have sent his draft direct to the\r\nCleveland bank, but he no doubt thought it better to transact such\r\nmatters through his own bank.\r\n\r\nOr if Mr. Thomas lived where he was not in touch with a bank, he\r\nmight have drawn through any person whom he knew in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the draft for collection, the Cleveland bank would at\r\nonce give it to a clerk who would without delay present it to Mr.\r\nTaylor.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor, having written his acceptance of the draft, is given\r\nthree days grace in which to make payment.\r\n\r\nIn states where days of grace are not allowed, he would have to\r\npay at once.\r\n\r\nMr. Taylor writes the word \"accepted,\" with the date and his name\r\nacross the face of the draft, and if he does not pay cash, he\r\nstates in the writing where payment will be made.\r\n\r\nOf course, Mr. Taylor cannot be compelled to accept a draft. There\r\nmay be good and honest reasons for his not doing so, but having\r\naccepted it, in business honor he is bound to pay it.\r\n\r\nThe term \"Sight draft\" explains itself, but the order to pay a\r\ndraft may indicate, and often does, the number of days allowed for\r\npayment, after presentation.\r\n\r\nFOR COLLECTION\r\n\r\nWhat should be done by the man to whom a bill or a note is due,\r\nwhen the debtor lives in a place where there is no bank?\r\n\r\nIn that case he must learn in some way the name of a promising\r\nperson to make the collection for him.\r\n\r\nIn this case he makes out the draft as before, and adds the words\r\n\"for collection.\" This acts as a bar to any transfer of the paper.\r\n\r\nMost banks refuse to handle a draft marked \"for collection.\"\r\n\r\nDISHONOR\r\n\r\nDrafts are not necessarily duns.\r\n\r\nSome country merchants prefer to pay their bills to wholesalers in\r\nthat way, so that collecting drafts is no small part of the\r\nbusiness of the ordinary bank.\r\n\r\nWhile men are not compelled to meet drafts when presented, if the\r\namount is due and he defaults or refuses to pay he injures his own\r\ncredit.\r\n\r\nIn refusing a just draft he is said to \"dishonor\" it.\r\n\r\nSo sure are wholesalers that their drafts will be met by their\r\ndistant debtors that they do not hesitate to draw against them\r\nwhen deposited for collection, regarding them as cash to their\r\ncredit in bank.\r\n\r\nPROTESTS\r\n\r\nWhen a draft is not accepted or paid when due, if it be a time\r\ndraft, it is protested in the same way as a note.\r\n\r\nThe protest of a draft serves as a notice to the drawer of its\r\nnon-acceptance.\r\n\r\nLike notes and checks, drafts may be transferred by a similar\r\nendorsement.\r\n\r\nBUYING DRAFTS\r\n\r\nIf I wanted to pay a bill for $150 to Albert Holt, living at\r\nWallace, Kansas, and did not wish to trouble him with a check, how\r\nwould I go about it?\r\n\r\n1. I might express the cash, which would be expensive.\r\n2. I might send it in postal order, not always certain.\r\n3. I might send it by a trusted hand, but might have long to wait\r\nbefore I found a friend going out to Wallace.\r\n\r\nI am living in New York City, and am familiar enough with banking\r\nto know that New York is a great financial center and is in\r\nconstant communication with nearly all the outside banks.\r\n\r\nThe outside banks keep money in deposit here, and the New York\r\nbanks, particularly in the spring and autumn, keep deposits with\r\ntheir correspondents.\r\n\r\nWith my $150 and a small extra sum to pay my bank for drawing the\r\ndraft, I go thither and buy a draft for the sum I owe Mr. Holt.\r\n\r\nI mail this draft to my creditor and he can cash it without loss\r\nin his home bank. Here is the form:\r\n\r\n                              No. 101.\r\n    Madison National Bank of New York.\r\n  Pay to the order of Albert Holt,\r\n  One hundred and fifty dollars ($150.)...\r\n  ..........               L. N. Jones,\r\n                                 Cashier.\r\n  To Prairie National Bank,\r\n    Wallace, Kansas.\r\n\r\nA GOOD PLAN\r\n\r\nWhen you buy a draft which you mean to send off in payment of a\r\ndebt, a good plan is to have it made payable to yourself.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose it is the case of Albert Holt. You transfer the\r\ndraft to him by writing across the back, \"Pay to the order of\r\nAlbert Holt,\" and add your signature.\r\n\r\nNow as all drafts are returned, as payment vouchers, to the banks\r\nfrom which they were issued, and as Mr. Holt must have signed the\r\ndraft to get his money, it follows that there is a record of his\r\nhaving received it, and this has all the force of a receipt.\r\n\r\nDo not endorse a draft with just your name, for in that case,\r\nanyone into whose hands it falls may collect. First write \"Pay to\r\nthe order of\" the person for whom it is intended.\r\n\r\nGOOD AS CASH\r\n\r\nA draft made payable to yourself is as good as cash, and far safer\r\nto carry.\r\n\r\nIf you are identified at any bank between the Atlantic and\r\nPacific, you can have your draft cashed.\r\n\r\nAll banks furnish blank drafts.\r\n\r\nNever endorse a draft made payable to yourself, and this applies\r\nto a check, until you are about to use it.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan never to sign your name until it is actually\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nSome people have the foolish habit of signing their names on stray\r\nbits of paper.\r\n\r\nDo not get into this habit, even if there is no space to fill out\r\na note or order above the signature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nJUST MONEY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been before stated, money in its broadest meaning is a\r\nmedium of exchange.\r\n\r\nAnything that can pay a debt or purchase property, in any part of\r\na country, is the money of that country.\r\n\r\nEvery civilized country has its own minted or printed money.\r\n\r\nThe usual mediums of circulation are gold, silver, nickel and\r\ncopper, the latter alloyed more or less in the United States with\r\nnickel.\r\n\r\nGovernment and bank bills, while having all the purchasing power\r\nof gold, are simply promises to pay in gold, or other coin of\r\n\"redemption\", the amounts they represent.\r\n\r\nThe money of one country cannot legally be made to pay a debt in\r\nanother country, unless both parties to the payment agree to it.\r\n\r\nWhen gold is exchanged to settle the balances of trade between two\r\ncountries, it is not reckoned, if coined, at its face value, but\r\nat its bullion value.\r\n\r\nThe word \"pecunia\" meant in ancient Greece and Rome a flock or\r\nherd.\r\n\r\nIn those days live stock were used as a medium of exchange, or\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nWe keep the word and often use it as in \"pecuniary\" affairs, and\r\nwhen we call a moneyless man, \"impecunious.\"\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES MONEY\r\n\r\nThe United States Government reserves to itself the right under\r\nthe constitution, to coin and issue the money to be used by its\r\nown people.\r\n\r\nFormerly we had two standards of value, gold and silver, or\r\nbimetalism.\r\n\r\nIf gold and silver were produced in relatively equal quantities,\r\nthe world would go on trading with money of both kinds, but the\r\nproportions are not the same.\r\n\r\nAmong the Aztecs and Peruvians silver ranked with gold as two to\r\none, that is, two pounds of silver would purchase as much as one\r\npound of gold.\r\n\r\nBut when great silver mines were discovered and new methods were\r\ndiscovered for extracting the metal, it became more and more\r\nabundant, till it depreciated far below the former value it had in\r\nits relation to gold.\r\n\r\nMost of the commercial nations decided to have but one standard of\r\nvalue, and that gold, long before the United States fell into\r\nline.\r\n\r\nOur money measure is known as the decimal, or metric. It would be\r\nconvenient, if we could follow the example of nearly all the other\r\ncommercial nations, and use the metric system for all our weights\r\nand measures.\r\n\r\nOUR METAL MONEY\r\n\r\nIn the United States Treasury at Washington, there are many\r\nmillion dollars in silver coins and bullion.\r\n\r\nThe gold standard has not driven silver out of circulation, for it\r\nis still found convenient to use it in settling immediately our\r\nsmaller business transactions.\r\n\r\nWhen the silver dollar was first coined, and indeed up to the\r\npresent date, the intention was that it should contain about a\r\ndollar's worth of silver, or 374 1/4 Troy grains of the pure\r\nmetal. This amount of silver was supposed to represent permanently\r\n24 3/4 grains of pure gold, and it did so represent its value at\r\none time, and would have continued to do so, had the relative\r\noutput of both metals been the same.\r\n\r\nOur chief mint is in Philadelphia, where is coined all the copper,\r\nnickel, silver, and gold money in use.\r\n\r\nTo imitate these metals, even where the full value is given,\r\nconstitutes the criminal offence called \"counterfeiting.\"\r\n\r\nIn former times, some of our older readers will remember them, the\r\nGovernment meant to have the metal in each coin of about its\r\nunstamped value in the market.\r\n\r\nIn those days the cent was as large as our present silver half\r\ndollar, and the copper two-cent piece was a monster in the way of\r\ncoinage.\r\n\r\nNow our copper and nickel coins are small and can be carried\r\nwithout testing strength of pockets. They are regarded as money\r\n\"tokens.\"\r\n\r\nSilver coins that are punched can be refused in the settlement of\r\na debt.\r\n\r\nPunched gold coins should always be refused, for they are never of\r\ntheir face value.\r\n\r\nSilver coins may be used in the settlement of bills up to $5.00.\r\n\r\nGold coins are, of course, legal tender up to any amount.\r\n\r\nPAPER MONEY\r\n\r\nWe usually class all paper money as \"bills.\"\r\n\r\nThere are three classes of bills, all quite different in their\r\ninception and meaning. These are--\r\n\r\n1. National bank notes.\r\n2. Treasury notes or \"greenbacks.\"\r\n3. Treasury certificates.\r\n\r\nBANK NOTES\r\n\r\nA national bank note is the guaranteed promise of some national\r\nbank to pay coin or its equivalent to any one presenting the note\r\nat the bank and asking to have the exchange made.\r\n\r\nThis exchange is called \"redeeming.\"\r\n\r\nIf you examine a bank bill you will notice that it is drawn much\r\nlike an ordinary business \"demand\" note, made payable to \"bearer,\"\r\nand signed by the bank president and cashier.\r\n\r\nFor every dollar of its own sent out in the form of a bill by a\r\nnational bank, the Government holds a dollar of the bank's\r\ncollateral to guarantee the redemption of the note if the bank\r\nshould fail.\r\n\r\nNational bank notes are received in all business transactions,\r\nbecause they are secured by the Government, yet there are cases in\r\nwhich even the Government will not receive them in payment of a\r\nclaim, nor pay them out itself.\r\n\r\n1. All import duties must be paid in gold.\r\n2. The Government pays the interest on its own bonds in gold.\r\n\r\nThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing--a department of the United\r\nStates Treasury--makes and prints all the national bank notes.\r\n\r\nOn all these notes the names of the United States Treasurer and\r\nthe United States Register appear. The names look like signatures,\r\nbut they are facsimilies and are printed with the note.\r\n\r\nThe notes are printed on specially prepared paper, to imitate\r\nwhich is regarded as a counterfeit.\r\n\r\nSoiled and worn out bank notes may be exchanged for fresh ones at\r\nthe Treasury Department.\r\n\r\n\"GREENBACKS\"\r\n\r\nGreenbacks are treasury notes. The name comes from the color in\r\nwhich they first appeared in the years of our Civil War.\r\n\r\nThe treasury note is really an engraved promissory note of the\r\nUnited States Government made payable to the bearer, and bearing\r\nthe signatures of the Treasurer and Register of the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThese notes are issued in denominations of from five to ten\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nFormerly there were one and two-dollar treasury notes issued, and\r\nwe still find some of these \"old-timers\" in circulation.\r\n\r\nThere are so many treasury notes in circulation that the\r\nGovernment, vast though its bullion and coin reserves are, could\r\nnot redeem them if presented at once.\r\n\r\nThe treasury note is a legal tender for any amount of\r\nindebtedness.\r\n\r\nThe Government prints the following guarantee on every treasury\r\nnote:\r\n\r\n\"This note is, by law, to be considered as good as coin. Any one\r\nto whom you pay it must reckon it as equivalent to a dollar (or\r\nface value in dollars) in value.\"\r\n\r\nTREASURY CERTIFICATES\r\n\r\nThe treasury certificate is, in form, very much like the treasury\r\nnote, and it bears the signatures of the same officers.\r\n\r\nTreasury certificates are of two kinds, gold and silver.\r\n\r\nThe gold certificates are printed in yellow.\r\n\r\nThe silver certificates are light black and white.\r\n\r\nThese certificates are issued against the great reserves of gold\r\nand silver that are kept to redeem them.\r\n\r\nThe use of the gold certificate saves the loss of the gold that\r\ncomes through abrasion when handled.\r\n\r\nA five-dollar silver certificate is much more convenient to carry\r\nthan five silver dollars.\r\n\r\nThese certificates, as may be seen, are issued for the convenience\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nCertificates of either character will be redeemed to any amount,\r\nin the metals for which they call, if presented at the United\r\nStates Treasury at Washington, or at any of the sub-treasuries to\r\nbe found in our larger cities.\r\n\r\nWORN-OUT NOTES\r\n\r\nOnly those familiar with the work can realize the great quantities\r\nof bank bills, treasury notes, and certificates continually being\r\nmade and sent out from Washington.\r\n\r\nWhile a stream of clean, fresh paper of enormous value is going\r\nout to be spread all over the country, another stream of soiled,\r\ntorn and altogether disreputable-looking paper is flowing back to\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe filthy paper is quite as valuable as the clean, so it is\r\nproperly checked, recorded, and credited before new paper is sent\r\nout in its place.\r\n\r\nThey are now trying to make old bills presentable by washing them\r\nat the Department. Meanwhile, most of them are ground again into\r\npulp, made into new paper, and all the first processes gone\r\nthrough with to make the paper into money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nOUR POSTAL BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to a few years ago, it was the city, town and village dweller\r\nwho reaped the greatest benefit from the post office.\r\n\r\nIn dense communities carriers leave the mail at the place to which\r\nit is addressed. Where this is not done the walk for the mail is\r\nnot far.\r\n\r\nNow the purpose of our Government, which is of the people and by\r\nthe people, is to treat all the people alike.\r\n\r\nHowever, up to a few years ago the farmer, our most essential\r\nproducer, had not a fair deal.\r\n\r\nFortunately things have changed and are still changing for the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nRural Free Delivery was an idea as just as it was grand, and as\r\nwelcome as it was necessary.\r\n\r\nThe good work began October 1, 1896.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of rural free delivery is to accommodate dwellers in\r\nthe country, whether farmers or not.\r\n\r\nThrough this branch of the service mails are carried daily, on\r\nfixed lines of travel, to people who otherwise would have to go\r\nlong distances to reach a post office.\r\n\r\nThe Government requires that the states or counties shall keep in\r\ngood condition the roads traversed by the mail carriers.\r\n\r\nGates must not obstruct, and it is required that every unfordable\r\nstream shall be bridged.\r\n\r\nIt is further required, as a condition for establishing a line for\r\nrural free delivery, that each route of twenty-four or more miles\r\nin length shall have at least one hundred families resident on\r\neither side.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFIED MAIL MATTER\r\n\r\nMail matter is divided into four classes. For each class a\r\ndifferent rate is charged.\r\n\r\nFirst Class:--All letters, and all other written matter, with a\r\nfew exceptions, pay two cents for each ounce, or fraction of an\r\nounce.\r\n\r\nSecond Class:--Newspapers, magazines, and other periodicals, one\r\ncent for each four ounces or fraction of four ounces. Publishers\r\nof periodicals, sending direct from place of publication, get a\r\nlower rate,--one cent a pound.\r\n\r\nThird Class:--Books, circulars, and other printed matter, one cent\r\nfor two ounces or fraction of two ounces.\r\n\r\nFourth Class:--Merchandise and miscellaneous articles, weighing\r\nnot over four pounds, one cent for each ounce or fraction of an\r\nounce.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL RULES\r\n\r\n1. On a tag, or the paper on which the address is written, the\r\nsender of third class matter may write \"from\" and add his own name\r\nand address.\r\n2. On the blank leaf of a book, forwarded as third class matter,\r\nthe sender may write a dedication or inscription, but it must not\r\nbe in the form of a letter.\r\n3. Fourth class matter must be so wrapped that the postal\r\nauthorities can examine the contents without much trouble.\r\n4. Such articles as glass, nails, needles or other matter that\r\nmight work injury if it came loose, must be enclosed in two\r\nseparate wrappings, or a double case.\r\n5. Poisons, explosives, inflammable substances, and live animals\r\nare excluded from the mails.\r\n6. Firearms may only be sent in detached parts.\r\n7. All alcoholic liquors are regarded as explosive.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN RATES\r\n\r\nThe rates to Canada are the same for all classes of matter as in\r\nthe United States, except that seeds, scions, bulbs, cuttings, and\r\nroots are one cent per ounce.\r\n\r\nTo Cuba all the rates are the same as for domestic matter.\r\n\r\nRates with Mexico are the same as if mailed between our own\r\nstates. Packages are limited to 4 pounds 6 ounces, except that\r\nsingle books may weigh more. Merchandise must be sent by parcel\r\npost.\r\n\r\nTo all other countries, in what is known as the \"Postal Union\",\r\nthe rates for letters are five cents for each half ounce or\r\nfraction thereof.\r\n\r\nPostal cards two cents each, double four cents.\r\n\r\nRegistration fees or letters or other articles, four cents each.\r\n\r\nOrdinary letters for foreign countries, except Canada, Cuba and\r\nMexico, must be forwarded, whether any postage is paid on them or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAll other mailable matter must be prepaid.\r\n\r\nAlaska, Hawaii, Guam, Tetuila, the Philippines and Porto Rico are\r\nregarded as insular or territorial possessions of the United\r\nStates, and are entitled to the same postal rates.\r\n\r\nSTAMPS\r\n\r\nPostage stamps may be purchased at any United States post office,\r\nor at any place authorized to sell them.\r\n\r\nAnyone may sell postage stamps as he would any other personal\r\nasset.\r\n\r\nIf stamps are bought to be enclosed in a letter, they should never\r\nbe of a higher denomination than twos and ones, as they are easily\r\ndisposed of.\r\n\r\nLetters should always be stamped on the upper right-hand corner of\r\nthe envelope.\r\n\r\nPackages should be stamped in the same way and on the addressed\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe using of cancelled stamps is a felony.\r\n\r\nForeign stamps have no value on letters or parcels mailed in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nA domestic, unstamped letter will not be forwarded.\r\n\r\nIf a stamped letter is found to require more postage, the amount\r\nlacking is stamped on the letter, and must be paid by the\r\nreceiver.\r\n\r\nStamped envelopes and stamped wrappers are sold by the post office\r\nat the usual rates of postage, with the cost of the paper added.\r\n\r\nIf a stamped envelope or wrapper is spoiled, the stamp must not be\r\ncut off and used by pasting on another envelope or wrapper, for it\r\nwill be treated as if no postage were paid.\r\n\r\nSuch spoiled wrappers or envelopes will be exchanged, without\r\ncharge, by the postmaster, for stamps of the same value.\r\n\r\nPOSTAL CARDS\r\n\r\nNever use a postal card to dun a debtor.\r\n\r\nNever send a confidential message on a postal card.\r\n\r\nForeign postal cards, that is those bearing a foreign stamp,\r\ncannot be used in the United States.\r\n\r\nAn international postal card can be bought.\r\n\r\nPostal cards and letters may be redirected and forwarded without\r\nextra charge, where the address of the receiver has been changed.\r\nPackages require a renewal of payment in such cases.\r\n\r\nREGISTERING LETTERS\r\n\r\nA letter or a parcel may be registered to further insure its safe\r\ndelivery.\r\n\r\nWhen a letter or parcel is registered, it must have the sender's\r\nname and address written across the left-hand end of the envelope\r\nand on the reverse side.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the stamps required ordinarily, eight cents in\r\nstamps or in a regularly prepared stamp, is the registration fee.\r\n\r\nThe clerk, receiving a registered parcel, gives the sender a\r\nreceipt for the same. After the letter has reached its\r\ndestination, the sender gets a second receipt, through the post\r\noffice, signed with the receiver's name.\r\n\r\nThe receiver of a registered parcel signs two receipts, one for\r\nthe post office and the other for the sender.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL DELIVERY\r\n\r\nThe purpose of what is known, in connection with the post office,\r\nas the \"Special Delivery System\", is to insure the delivery of any\r\nletter or package to the person, to whom it is addressed, as soon\r\nas it reaches his post office.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the regular post charge, a fee of 10 cents is added\r\nfor special delivery. This is in the form of a special stamp,\r\nthough when this cannot be had, the same amount in ordinary stamps\r\nmay be attached.\r\n\r\nIn the case noted, the sender should write in line with the\r\nstamps, \"special delivery.\"\r\n\r\nSpecial delivery messages are delivered, not by ordinary carriers,\r\nbut by special delivery messengers.\r\n\r\nThe special delivery letter is used when immediate knowledge is\r\nnecessary. It saves a long telegram.\r\n\r\nMONEY ORDERS\r\n\r\nMoney, in limited sums, may be sent through the post office. One\r\nadvantage of sending money in this way is that it practically\r\ninsures the sender against loss.\r\n\r\nAll post offices are not money order offices.\r\n\r\nA post office money order may only be sent to those places where\r\nthere are such offices.\r\n\r\nAt all post offices, authorized to send money orders, proper\r\nblanks can be had on which the sender can write his order.\r\n\r\nAny sum may be sent by postal order, from one cent to one hundred\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nThe fee is from three to thirty cents.\r\n\r\nRead the blank carefully; it is simple, but be sure you understand\r\nit before filling out the order.\r\n\r\nIf in doubt, ask the clerk.\r\n\r\nHaving filled out the order, hand it to the clerk with the sum\r\nrequired, and the additional fee.\r\n\r\nThe clerk then prepares and hands out an order for the amount, on\r\nthe postmaster of the town to which you are sending your letter,\r\nand this you enclose to your correspondent.\r\n\r\nCASHING POST OFFICE ORDERS\r\n\r\nThe money order never contains the name of the sender; this the\r\npostmaster of the office from which it is sent supplies in a\r\nseparate communication to the postmaster who is to pay.\r\n\r\nNo money passes from one office to the other.\r\n\r\nA post office order is like a draft drawn by one postmaster on\r\nanother. The one credits the sum, the other debits it.\r\n\r\nThe holder of an order will not get his money unless he is known\r\nto the paying postmaster or is identified.\r\n\r\nBefore paying an order the postmaster requires the holder to\r\nreceipt it.\r\n\r\nA post office money order, like a check or draft, may be\r\ntransferred to another for collection.\r\n\r\nBanks receive transferred money orders as if they were cash\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nThe party to whom orders are transferred must go through the same\r\nforms at the office, where payment is made, as if he was the\r\noriginal payee.\r\n\r\nADVICE\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to register letters containing checks. Never\r\nwrite \"personal\" on a business letter.\r\n\r\nAlways enclose a stamp for reply when writing to a stranger.\r\n\r\nSee that the addresses on your letters are distinctly legible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTELEGRAMS--THE TELEPHONE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo send a telegram, you or your messenger must take what you have\r\nwritten to the nearest telegraph office.\r\n\r\nYou may write a telegram on any kind of paper, provided always\r\nthat the writing is plain.\r\n\r\nAll telegraph offices are provided with regular blank forms, which\r\nmay be had without cost, and it is better to use these when they\r\nare available.\r\n\r\nThe blank is properly ruled, with lines for the date, for the\r\naddress of the one to whom it is to be sent, and for the message.\r\n\r\nCHARGES\r\n\r\nThe telegraph company charges a fixed sum for a message of, say,\r\nten words. These words do not include the name and address of the\r\nsender.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the charge is always dependent on the distance\r\nbetween the office from which the message is sent and the one at\r\nwhich it is received.\r\n\r\nEvery word over ten, in the message, pays an extra fee, dependent\r\nagain on the distance.\r\n\r\nGetting just what you mean into ten words may seem difficult when\r\nyou have a lot to say, but it is surprising how you can boil the\r\nmessage down when each additional word costs five or more cents.\r\n\r\nIt may pay to practice this.\r\n\r\nIf it is actually necessary to make your meaning clear by the\r\naddition of more words, do not hesitate at the cost.\r\n\r\nIf you are known at the telegraph office, you can send a message\r\nto be collected from the receiver.\r\n\r\nNever permit the receiver to pay for a message that is exclusively\r\non your own business.\r\n\r\nAlways make and keep a copy of every important telegram you send\r\naway. Do not neglect this.\r\n\r\nIf you have neglected to keep a copy of a telegram, or having made\r\none have lost it, you may get a copy from the telegraph office,\r\nprovided the application be made within six months of the sending\r\nof the message.\r\n\r\nTelegrams are delivered by the company's messengers.\r\n\r\nYou must give receipt to the messenger on the delivery of a\r\ntelegram.\r\n\r\nWhere the receiver lives a long distance from the telegraph\r\noffice, it is customary to pay the messenger an additional fee,\r\ndepending on the distance.\r\n\r\nThe charges for telegrams to be sent at night and delivered in the\r\nmorning, are much lower than for day messages.\r\n\r\nFor an additional charge, less than the original, messages may be\r\nrepeated back to insure their accuracy.\r\n\r\nRead over to the official, or still better, have him read your\r\nmessage over in your presence, that you may be sure he understands\r\nit as written.\r\n\r\nYou cannot hold others responsible for your own mistakes.\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPHING MONEY\r\n\r\nYou can telegraph money with as much safety as you can send it\r\nthrough a bank.\r\n\r\nIn handling money in this way, the telegraph company does not act\r\nas a banker but as a carrier.\r\n\r\nTelegraph money orders are a great convenience, when one wants to\r\nsend cash to a distant point in a hurry.\r\n\r\nCountry telegraph offices do not, as a rule, transmit money; that\r\nfunction is left to the offices in the larger centers.\r\n\r\nTHE METHOD\r\n\r\nOne wishing to \"wire money\" will find at the telegraph office\r\nsuitable blanks; they are furnished gratis.\r\n\r\nOn lines provided for the purpose and properly indicated, as in a\r\npostal order form, write the name and address of the person to\r\nreceive the money, with the amount.\r\n\r\nThis paper, properly signed, is handed to the clerk with the money\r\nto be sent and the fee for transmission.\r\n\r\nThe fee is double that charged for an ordinary message of the same\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nIf, for any reason, the person to whom the money is sent cannot be\r\nfound within forty-eight hours, the money is returned to the\r\nsender, but the fees are retained, as the company is not to blame\r\nfor failure.\r\n\r\nThe receiver of a money order, if unknown, must identify himself\r\nas he would at a bank, and he must receipt for the money.\r\n\r\nIf the person to receive the money is an entire stranger in the\r\nplace to which the money is sent, the sender knows it, and he\r\nprovides for the situation by signing, on the reverse of the\r\napplication, an order to the distant operator to pay the money to\r\nthe person named within, without further identification.\r\n\r\nWhen a telegraph operator receives a money order, he at once seeks\r\nout the person to whom it is sent, and pays the money in\r\naccordance with his instructions as to identification.\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE\r\n\r\nThe telephone, local and long distance, is fast superceding the\r\ntelegraph as a medium for speedy business communications.\r\n\r\nIts use is not confined to large cities as at first.\r\n\r\nNearly every village is now in communication with the outer world\r\nthrough the telephone.\r\n\r\nThe world has just awakened to the needs of its food producer, the\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nIn Norway, which is not a rich country, the telephone has been\r\nintroduced on the farms. The rates are low and the benefits are\r\ninestimable.\r\n\r\nOn our large farms, in the West, telephones have been in use for\r\nsome time as an essential part of the machinery.\r\n\r\nNow, there is a move on foot to make them available for every\r\nfarmer in the more settled regions.\r\n\r\nWhile business can be conducted over the telephone, as if the\r\nspeakers stood face to face, yet such transactions not being\r\nrecorded, will not stand in law, if one of the parties should\r\ndispute the other's word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nBUSINESS BY EXPRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of expresses, viz.: local and general. The\r\nnames describe the provinces of each, though a general express may\r\ndo a local business.\r\n\r\nAll express companies are common carriers.\r\n\r\nThe carrying business done by our express companies is enormous.\r\nThey have their own special cars attached to passenger and fast\r\nfreight trains, and their goods are given special departments in\r\nwater transportation.\r\n\r\nIf living between two towns, it is always better to have your\r\nletters and express business done through one office.\r\n\r\nINSTRUCTIONS\r\n\r\nWhen ordering material by express, make sure that you give the\r\naddress, to which you wish it sent, in such a way that a mistake\r\non the part of the forwarder will be out of the question.\r\n\r\nIf you send away goods by express, make sure that they are\r\nsecurely packed, and be equally sure that the address is clearly\r\nwritten and in a large hand. It would be better if the address\r\ncould be painted on with a brush.\r\n\r\nIf you should send perishable stuff, like meat, flowers, glass, or\r\nfruit, be sure to label the package \"perishable\" or \"Handle with\r\ncare, glass.\"\r\n\r\nOn long distance transportation prepayment is required; on short\r\ndistances it is optional.\r\n\r\nIt is always better to get from the express agent a receipt for\r\nthe matter taken in charge.\r\n\r\nTake care to put your own address on the lower left-hand corner of\r\nthe package to be sent.\r\n\r\nIf the person to whom the parcel is sent cannot be found, the\r\naddress will enable the express company to notify the sender at\r\nonce of the fact.\r\n\r\nWhen sending any goods by express, it is always prudent to notify\r\nthe person for whom they are intended of the fact by mail, and\r\nalso to state the company by which the matter was sent and the\r\ndate of shipment.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPANY'S DUTY\r\n\r\nThe express company must always require, on delivering goods, a\r\nreceipt from the receiver.\r\n\r\nIf the goods should be received by a second person, on behalf of\r\nthe consignee, he must sign the consignee's name, and under that\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nIf a package appears to be damaged in transmission, the express\r\ncompany must permit the receiver to examine it before signing. He\r\nmay refuse to sign or to accept in any way, if the goods are\r\ninjured, or not as he ordered.\r\n\r\nExpress companies are responsible for all damages sustained by\r\ngoods while in their charge.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTIONS BY EXPRESS\r\n\r\nAll the large express companies have the machinery for collecting\r\naccounts and notes whenever they have branch offices.\r\n\r\nSuch companies are reliable collectors. Their services are prompt\r\nand their charges reasonable.\r\n\r\nWhere an express company fails to collect, notice is promptly\r\ngiven with the reasons for failure.\r\n\r\nWhen you wish an express company to collect, it will be necessary\r\nfor you to make out a statement of the account. This is placed in\r\na special envelope, provided by the company. It is properly\r\nindorsed and handed to the company's representative.\r\n\r\nThe company charges a small fee for collection, whether it\r\nsucceeds or not. In any case the fee is not much above a fourth of\r\none per cent, unless there should be unusual trouble.\r\n\r\nC. O. D. BY EXPRESS\r\n\r\nAs you know, C.O.D. means \"cash on delivery\".\r\n\r\nCash on delivery orders constitute no small part of every express\r\ncompany's business.\r\n\r\nWhen goods are forwarded in this way, the sender furnishes with\r\nthe goods an itemized bill duly receipted. The express company's\r\ncharges should be included in the bill.\r\n\r\nThe express agent is sure to collect the bill before he lets the\r\ngoods leave his keeping.\r\n\r\nMONEY BY EXPRESS\r\n\r\nShould you desire to send money by express, it will be well to go\r\nto the company's office before you pack it up.\r\n\r\nExpress companies have special receptacles or envelopes in which\r\nto store coin or bills. There is no charge for these.\r\n\r\nThe sender must himself seal the packages containing the money,\r\nand write on them the address of the consignee, also the amount\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\nHaving received the packages, the express agent ties them up,\r\naffixes his official seal, which is so arranged that the package\r\ncannot be opened or tampered with, without breaking. This done, he\r\ngives the sender a receipt. This should be cared for as a vital\r\npart of the record.\r\n\r\nThe charges for sending money by express may or may not be paid in\r\nadvance. They vary with the amount to be carried and the distance.\r\n\r\nPackages of money are receipted for in the usual way. They are\r\ndelivered only to the legal consignee, unless a second person\r\nshould appear with an order, amounting to a power of attorney, and\r\nwhich the company cannot reject.\r\n\r\nMONEY ORDERS\r\n\r\nThe foregoing by no means limits the express company's usefulness\r\nor field of opportunities.\r\n\r\nExpress companies issue money orders much as does the Post Office\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\nAs with the post office, the fees for orders vary, but no order is\r\nissued for more than fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nIf you want to send such an order, the express company will\r\nfurnish the proper blank for you to fill out.\r\n\r\nOn this form must be written out very plainly the name and address\r\nof the person to whom the order is to be sent, with the amount, in\r\nwords and in figures.\r\n\r\nOn receiving the money the express agent gives to his customer two\r\npapers; one is the company's receipt for the money, the other is\r\nthe order itself.\r\n\r\nThe order instructs the agent at the point to which it is to be\r\nsent to pay the sum named to the person named.\r\n\r\nTo complete the order the sender should sign his name in a place\r\nindicated for the purpose on the back of the paper.\r\n\r\nThis done, the order can be sent to the person for whom it is\r\nintended, in an ordinary envelope.\r\n\r\nThe receiver of an express money order can have it cashed at the\r\nexpress office in his town, or sign it and place it in his own\r\nbank as if it were cash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nABOUT RAILROADS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot everything about railroads, that would be a tremendous\r\nundertaking, but just enough to show what everyone should know\r\nabout them as carriers of goods.\r\n\r\nThe express companies have practically a monopoly of the\r\ntransportation of the smaller packages of goods requiring quick\r\ntransit and immediate delivery, but the longer, heavier, and\r\nslower freight are in the hands of the railroads, and where it can\r\nbe done, and time is not a first factor, the steamboat takes the\r\nplace of the train.\r\n\r\nBILLS OF LADING\r\n\r\nAs most of the goods in changing hands are carried by steamboat or\r\nrailroad, the method of shipment should be understood by everyone\r\nwho may be called on to use one or the other means of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nThe person shipping goods in this way is the \"consignor.\"\r\n\r\nThe person to whom the goods are shipped is the \"consignee\".\r\n\r\nThe goods shipped are described in a paper called a \"bill of\r\nlading.\"\r\n\r\nA bill of lading is a written contract, or statement of the goods\r\nshipped, their condition, and the time of shipment.\r\n\r\nBills of lading and receipt blanks are furnished at the offices of\r\nthe transportation companies.\r\n\r\nTwo copies of the bill of lading should be made out. One of these\r\nis signed by the consignor and the other by the transportation\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nThe copy signed by the consignor is kept by the agent, and the\r\ncopy signed by the agent is retained by the consignor, as a\r\nvoucher for the goods shipped.\r\n\r\nThis receipt should be mailed to the consignee.\r\n\r\nWhen the consignee gets this bill of lading, it is a voucher to\r\nthe freight agent, where the goods are to be delivered, as to the\r\nownership.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for the agent at the point of shipment to send a copy\r\nof the bill of lading to the agent where the goods are received.\r\nIn this way he can compare the consignment with the consignee's\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nEXPENSE BILLS\r\n\r\nIt is not usual to pay freight bills at the point of shipment,\r\nthat being left till the goods reach their destination.\r\n\r\nThe agent at the place of delivery makes out an \"expense bill,\"\r\nwhich is an itemized statement of the freight charges, and must be\r\npaid by the consignee before delivery.\r\n\r\nThis done, the consignee must sign a receipt for the goods\r\ndelivered, and the affair is closed.\r\n\r\nA BILL AND A DRAFT\r\n\r\nBefore wholesale houses or manufacturers ship goods, they are\r\neither paid for or they have a business understanding with the\r\nconsignee as to when and how the payment is to be made.\r\n\r\nThere are occasions, however, when no such arrangement has been\r\nmade, and a man not well known to the merchant orders goods\r\nshipped by freight.\r\n\r\nIn a case like this, the merchant may ascertain through a\r\ncommercial agency--the agencies make it their business to keep\r\nposted in such matters--the standing of the man giving the order.\r\n\r\nTrade has its risks and the merchant, even where the information\r\nis not quite assuring, may decide to fill the order and ship it.\r\n\r\nAs with express companies, goods may be sent as freight, C. O. D.\r\n\r\nThis is done by means of a bill of lading, to which is attached a\r\ndraft. The shipper bills the goods to himself at the point to\r\nwhich they were ordered.\r\n\r\nTo the bill of lading he attaches a draft for the sum involved,\r\nbut this, instead of being forwarded to the consignee by mail, is\r\nsent to him through a bank for collection.\r\n\r\nNow before the consignee can get the bill of lading, which\r\nauthorizes him to receive the goods, he must pay the draft.\r\n\r\nThe bill, which is in the shipper's name, is then endorsed over to\r\nthe payer of the draft.\r\n\r\nCountry merchants and sometimes farmers send produce by freight to\r\nbe sold on commission in the city.\r\n\r\nAN INVOICE\r\n\r\n        Delhi, N. Y., Sept. 9, 1910.\r\n   Invoice of Merchandise shipped by\r\n                       Harry T. Jackson\r\n and consigned to Brown, Smith & Co.,\r\n                       Newburg, N. Y.\r\n   to be sold on commission.\r\n    120 bbls. Potatoes\r\n     70 \" green apples\r\n     40 Crates tomatoes.\r\n\r\nMark plainly all goods shipped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTAXES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, tax bills are paid with reluctance.\r\n\r\nThis is no doubt due to the fact that with every other form of\r\npayment one has something tangible to show for the expenditure.\r\n\r\nIf every good citizen could be brought to see that his private\r\ninterests are closely linked with public affairs, he would take\r\nmore interest in the local politics of his town and county, and so\r\nhave a voice in the expenditure of taxes by selecting the best men\r\nto do the work for him.\r\n\r\nTaxes are forced contributions levied on citizens to provide money\r\nfor public expenses, such as law and order, schools, charities and\r\npublic institutions.\r\n\r\nAll tax laws are made by the men who pay the taxes.\r\n\r\nYou say \"No\" to this.\r\n\r\n\"The tax laws are made by the legislators up at the state\r\ncapital.\"\r\n\r\nVery true; but who nominates and elects the legislators? Did you\r\nnot put them into office?\r\n\r\n\"No, the bosses did that,\" you reply.\r\n\r\nTrue again, but good men are in the majority and if they did their\r\nduty to their country and themselves, there would be no bosses and\r\ntaxes would be honestly spent.\r\n\r\nKINDS OF TAXES\r\n\r\nTax laws are enacted by Congress, and by the legislatures of our\r\nmany states. Taxes cannot be collected without this authority.\r\n\r\nState taxes are collected for the state use only.\r\n\r\nUnited States taxes are expended for the benefit of all the people\r\nof all the states.\r\n\r\nTaxes may be further divided into direct and indirect.\r\n\r\nDirect taxes are, at present, only employed by the states. They\r\nare levied on realty and personal property, and are paid by the\r\nparticular person named in the tax bill presented by the\r\nauthorized collector.\r\n\r\nThe amount of these taxes vary each year, depending on the public\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nThey are based on assessments made by officers appointed for the\r\npurpose and generally known as assessors.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS DUTY\r\n\r\nThough there is no demand made on each individual to pay the\r\nindirect taxes required by the Government, yet indirectly every\r\nperson who spends little or much money is paying them.\r\n\r\nThe Government's chief means of raising the great sums of money\r\nneeded yearly to carry on its machinery is by customs duties and\r\ninternal revenue collections.\r\n\r\nThe customs revenue is obtained from a tax levied on certain\r\narticles imported from foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThis customs tax is called a tariff.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the goods that shall be subject to a tariff and\r\nthe amount to be levied on the same, is one that has long\r\nperplexed statesmen and been a leading party issue.\r\n\r\nThe merchant, to whom the goods are assigned from a foreign port,\r\nmust pay the duty levied on them by a Government Appraiser before\r\nhe can take them away.\r\n\r\nPrivate parties, landing from abroad at any of our ports of entry,\r\nare required, before getting their baggage, to write out a\r\ndeclaration of the things contained in their trunks. But this\r\ndeclaration does not prevent the customs inspectors from making a\r\ncareful personal examination. All things found dutiable, whether\r\ndeclared or not, are set apart and held until the assessment or\r\nduty is paid.\r\n\r\nThe evasion of a customs duty is called \"smuggling\" and is\r\npunished by the confiscation of the goods, and penalties in the\r\nway of fine and imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThere are people who would consider it a sin to cheat their\r\nbutcher, but see no wrong in cheating the Government.\r\n\r\nTo the merchant who pays tariff duties the amount involved is a\r\ndirect tax.\r\n\r\nWhen the merchant sells his goods to the retailer or consumer, he\r\nadds the tariff to his freight, insurance, interest, etc., as\r\ndirect purchase cost. This is strict business, but the consumer\r\npays all the bills with the profit added.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REVENUE\r\n\r\nThe second great source of Government revenue is derived from the\r\ninternal revenue tax, or excise duties.\r\n\r\nManufacturers of alcohol, whether as wine, whiskey, or beer, and\r\nthe producers of tobacco, in its manufactured forms, have to pay\r\nan excise tax in proportion to the amount and character of their\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nAs with the customs tax, the excise tax is added by the\r\nmanufacturer to the cost of production, so that at last it is the\r\nconsumer who pays it.\r\n\r\nSTAMPS\r\n\r\nWhile the manufacturers of alcohol pay the excise tax in bulk,\r\nthat is on the number of gallons produced, the manufacturers of\r\ncigars and tobacco have to attach to each separate package a\r\ndistinct internal revenue stamp.\r\n\r\nThese stamps are purchased from the internal revenue collectors,\r\nappointed by the Government to certain districts. The stamps show\r\nat a glance that the proper tax has been paid, just as the postage\r\nstamp affixed to a letter proves that the price for carrying it\r\nand delivering it has been paid.\r\n\r\nAs it is a penal offence to use a postage stamp a second time, so\r\nit is a punishable offence to attempt the use of a cancelled or\r\ntorn internal revenue stamp.\r\n\r\nIf demanded, the Government will give a receipt for the sum\r\nreceived from any one for considerable sales of postal or revenue\r\nstamps.\r\n\r\nSTATE TAXES\r\n\r\nState taxes, as has been stated, are levied on real and personal\r\nproperty. Some states have in addition a poll tax. This is levied\r\non the individual without any regard to his property, and a\r\nreceipt for it may be a requirement before a citizen is permitted\r\nto vote.\r\n\r\nOf course the real estate and personal property taxes are not the\r\nsame in all the states, for each state must raise every year the\r\nsum necessary to meet its own special requirements.\r\n\r\nThe intention of all tax laws is to have every citizen's\r\ncontribution bear the same proportion to the whole amount to be\r\nraised that his possessions bear to the aggregate property of all\r\nthe owners in the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nEXEMPT FROM TAXES\r\n\r\nAll our state laws exempt from taxation certain kinds of property.\r\n\r\nThe state cannot tax the property held by itself for the common\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe buildings and related properties of religious bodies and\r\nsocieties are not taxable.\r\n\r\nSuch educational institutions as colleges, seminaries, and private\r\ncharities are not taxed.\r\n\r\nCemeteries and other places where the dead are disposed of are not\r\ntaxed.\r\n\r\nCounty buildings, city parks, public schools, penal institutions,\r\nfair grounds for public use and similar property is never taxed.\r\n\r\nINSUFFICIENT TAXES\r\n\r\nThere have been times in the life of the Government, and in the\r\nbuilding up of the states, when the funds necessary for\r\nmaintenance from taxes, heavy though these have been at times,\r\nhave not been sufficient to meet the essential expenditures.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly the case with our Government during the\r\ntrying days of our Civil War.\r\n\r\nStates entering on great public works, for the benefit of the\r\ncommonwealth, frequently cannot raise the necessary money by the\r\nusual forms of taxation.\r\n\r\nIn these cases loans have to be made, that is the Government and\r\nthe state go out and borrow from those who have it to spare, the\r\nnecessary money.\r\n\r\nThe Government, the state, and it may be the city or county, gives\r\nto the party providing the money what is known as bond or bonds,\r\neach of a fixed amount and bearing a fixed rate of interest,\r\npayable as a rule semi-annually.\r\n\r\nPERSONAL PROPERTY\r\n\r\nThere is no form of property so easy to assess for the purpose of\r\ntaxation as real estate, that is the land and the buildings, for\r\nthe last selling value of this property is a matter of public\r\nrecord, and then the assessors, who should be men of honesty and\r\ngood judgment, are generally posted as to the value of the\r\nproperty under consideration.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, it comes to the taxation of personal property,\r\nwhich means any kind of property that can be detached and carried\r\nabout, it is a different matter.\r\n\r\nJust as many people, otherwise regarded as honest, do not think it\r\na great wrong to get the better of the Custom House, so many\r\nreputable people are inclined to revolt against the tax on\r\npersonal property and to conceal their actual possessions from the\r\nassessor, nor is this peculiarity confined to the poor.\r\n\r\nAny man may be legally compelled to swear to the accuracy of his\r\nstatement, and if it is found that he has knowingly sworn to a\r\nfalse statement, he may be brought to task for perjury.\r\n\r\nWhat is known as \"personal property\" varies in many of the states.\r\n\r\nPersonal property generally includes, merchandise in possession;\r\nall fixtures, all furniture in home, offices, and factories; all\r\nlive stock, all money on hand and in banks; other men's notes, not\r\ntransferred; all stocks and bonds and other forms of security.\r\n\r\nTOWN TAXES\r\n\r\nTownships or counties, if properly authorized by charter or the\r\nvotes of the people, may levy special taxes for special purposes\r\nwithin the limits of their own jurisdictions, or they may in the\r\nsame way sell bonds to carry out some work that has been decided\r\non for the common weal.\r\n\r\nTwo or more towns, or counties, may join in the same way to carry\r\nout a project of benefit to both, provided that the burden of the\r\nundertaking be equitably assessed.\r\n\r\nPAYMENTS\r\n\r\nAll tax bills are due and collectable on presentation, but this is\r\nnever enforced.\r\n\r\nA time is, however, fixed beyond which payment cannot be deferred.\r\n\r\nA sufficient amount of any property may be sold at auction to\r\nsatisfy a tax bill.\r\n\r\nOf old, and still in some places, the road taxes were paid in\r\ncash, but more frequently by work on the roads, either by the\r\nindividual man, or in connection with his team, each day's work of\r\none or both being fixed at a regular rate.\r\n\r\nTAXING CORPORATIONS\r\n\r\nThe state does not tax the individual members of a corporation for\r\nproperty held in common. The same result is secured better by\r\ntaxing the corporation as a body. This applies to banks,\r\nrailroads, and incorporated manufacturing establishments.\r\n\r\nSavings banks are taxed lightly. Every depositor is liable for a\r\npersonal property tax proportioned to the amount of his credit.\r\n\r\nTo make collection easy the savings bank always pays the amount of\r\nthis tax in bulk, and then charges it to the expense account of\r\nthe establishment, so that indirectly the depositors pay after\r\nall, as their dividends are reduced by just the amount of the tax.\r\n\r\nTAXES IN GENERAL\r\n\r\nWhen a man owns property in different towns, counties, or states,\r\nhe is regarded as so many individuals, and must pay each as the\r\nlocal demands require. No matter where a man's personal property\r\nis placed, the rule is to tax him for the whole at the place of\r\nhis usual residence.\r\n\r\nThe landlord and the merchant each pays a direct tax to the\r\ncollector, but it would be a business error to think that in so\r\ndoing either or both is carrying more than his share of the total\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nThe landlord keeps in mind the added expense when he comes to\r\nadjust leases with his tenants. The merchant, who pays taxes on\r\nhis stock and so adds to his expense account, should not be blamed\r\nif he keeps this in mind when he fixes the selling prices of his\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\nTHE RETURNS\r\n\r\nTaxes duly paid, honestly collected, and properly expended should\r\nnever be regarded as a burden.\r\n\r\nFrom no equal expenditure of money do the people get so much good.\r\n\r\nThe public schools, the public highways, the protection of life\r\nand property, public hospitals, public libraries, residences for\r\nthe old, the blind, the orphaned and the insane, as well as secure\r\nplaces for the lawless, are built and maintained by the taxpayer.\r\n\r\nAs a rule all these things are done honestly and well,\r\nnotwithstanding the outcry to the contrary.\r\n\r\nIf there be dishonesty in places, it is the fault quite as much of\r\nthe voter who selected him as of the official culprit himself.\r\n\r\nWe must take all the responsibility of our agents, whether they be\r\npublic or private.\r\n\r\nEvery good citizen should feel that his public duty is an\r\nimportant private business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCONTRACTS, LEASES, AND GUARANTEES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law books define a contract to be \"An agreement between two or\r\nmore persons to do or not to do a certain stated thing or things,\r\nfor a consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThe consideration is a vital part of every contract.\r\n\r\nThere can be no binding contract without a consideration.\r\n\r\nThe other requisites of a contract are--\r\n\r\n1. It must be possible of accomplishment.\r\n2. It must be in accordance with law.\r\n3. Its performance must not injure the public.\r\n4. The parties to a contract must be competent to do the things to\r\nwhich they pledge themselves.\r\n5. A drunken or an insane man cannot make a contract.\r\n6. All parties to a contract must be agreed.\r\n\r\nTHE CONSIDERATION\r\n\r\nNo contract can be held as binding where the consideration is not\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nA promise, verbal or in writing, to do something for a certain\r\nparty, cannot be enforced.\r\n\r\nA promise to do the same thing for a stipulation named is a\r\ncontract and may be enforced.\r\n\r\nA gift is not a form of contract. Once made it cannot be legally\r\ntaken back.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN AND VERBAL CONTRACTS\r\n\r\nThere are certain forms of contract which cannot be legally\r\nenforced, unless they are in writing.\r\n\r\n1. All contracts for the sale of real estate.\r\n2. Contracts that are not to be performed for a year or more.\r\n3. All contracts, to answer for the debt and obligations of\r\nanother, must be in writing.\r\n\r\nIf the contracting parties put but a part of their agreement in\r\nwriting the law will recognize only the written part. The whole\r\nmust be in writing, or the agreement will not hold.\r\n\r\nVerbal contracts are not safe.\r\n\r\nAlthough the law does not require even contract to be in writing,\r\nyet, as it never declares that a contract must be verbal, it is\r\nthe part of prudence, wherever possible, to put every contract in\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nOwing to defects of memory even honest men may, and frequently do,\r\ndisagree as to the terms of a verbal contract.\r\n\r\nBecause the party with whom the contract is made is a close\r\nfriend, one is apt to depend on a verbal agreement, but the closer\r\nthe friend or relative, the more reason there is for an exact\r\nwritten contract, if we would keep the friend.\r\n\r\nFORMS OF CONTRACT\r\n\r\nThe law is never specific as to the form of contract that may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to draw up the contract with the formal\r\naccuracy of a real estate deed.\r\n\r\nAny one with good sense and a fair common school education can\r\ndraw up a contract that will hold.\r\n\r\nKnow what is required, then state the facts simply.\r\n\r\nContracts need not be sworn to or even witnessed.\r\n\r\nKINDS OF CONTRACT\r\n\r\nEvery note, mortgage and other form of obligation is a specific\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nA lease is a form of contract between two people, known as\r\nlandlord and tenant, for the use of real estate for a period and\r\nat a rental specified in the document.\r\n\r\nA verbal lease may be made for a short period, but if for a year\r\nor more, it must be in writing.\r\n\r\nA lease should state when, where and to whom the rent is to be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nEach party to a lease, or other form contract should have a copy.\r\n\r\nIf the premises rented should become unusable by fire or any\r\naction of the elements the tenant is still liable for rent, unless\r\nthere is a special clause in the lease providing for such a\r\ncontingency.\r\n\r\nA tenant cannot, without the written consent of the landlord, use\r\nthe rented premises for any other purpose than that stated in the\r\nlease.\r\n\r\nAS TO REPAIRS\r\n\r\nIn some states the law compels the landlord to keep the premises\r\nin habitable repair, but this does not seem to be the rule. It\r\nshould be decided, where there is doubt, before signing the lease.\r\n\r\nWhere it is agreed that the landlord shall keep the premises in\r\nrepair, and, after due notice of the fact, he fails to do so, the\r\ntenant may himself make the repairs and deduct the amount from the\r\nrent.\r\n\r\nSUBLETTING\r\n\r\nIf there is no contract to the contrary, the tenant may sublet the\r\nwhole or any part of the premises, but this does not release him\r\nfrom liability for rent.\r\n\r\nIf the tenant fails to leave the property when his lease has\r\nexpired, the owner may make his demand through what is known as a\r\n\"notice to quit,\" which must be served on the tenant in person.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS A GUARANTY?\r\n\r\nA guaranty is sometimes required to insure the payment of rent.\r\n\r\nPlainly, a guaranty is an agreement to assume, under certain\r\nconditions, the liabilities of another.\r\n\r\nIf a man makes a contract, a lease, or a note, and his personal\r\nresources are not deemed sufficient to secure his performance of\r\nthe things agreed to, the other may require that some one, in whom\r\nhe has more faith, shall give him a guaranty, or personal security\r\nin writing.\r\n\r\nThe following might be used as the form for a guaranty for a\r\nlease, contract, note or other obligation of contract:\r\n\r\n    \"For value received, I hereby guarantee\r\n  the payment of the within lease (bond or\r\n  contract).        George L. Roberts.\"\r\n    Short Hills, N. J.\r\n      October 1, 1910.\r\n\r\nA BILL OF SALE\r\n\r\nThis is a written agreement by which one person transfers to\r\nanother his interest in certain personal property.\r\n\r\nThe law lays down no rule as to the form.\r\n\r\nA bill of sale usually passes where the property paid for is not\r\nimmediately removed from the possession of the seller.\r\n\r\nThis form would answer in any state:\r\n\r\n      \"Bridgeport, Conn., Aug. 2, 1910.\r\n    \"I have this day sold to Calvin E. Platt,\r\n  of New Haven, in this state, my team of\r\n  bay horses, with their harness, one family\r\n  carriage, and a two-seated cutter.\r\n                    \"Thomas P. Fletcher.\"\r\n\r\nBe sure, where the bill of sale includes many articles, to name\r\nevery one of them in the bill.\r\n\r\nIf paid for, whether by cash or a note, be sure to get a receipt\r\nfor the same.\r\n\r\nOBLIGATIONS\r\n\r\nA bond is a form of obligation.\r\n\r\nEvery enforcible bond must be in writing and under seal.\r\n\r\nThe maker of a bond by the act acknowledges a liability in the\r\nform of a debt or a duty.\r\n\r\nThe maker of a bond is the \"obligor.\"\r\n\r\nThe party to whom it is made is the \"obligee.\"\r\n\r\nThe bond names the liability or indebtedness; then follows the\r\ncondition wherein it is stated the particular thing that the\r\nobligor is to do, or not to do.\r\n\r\nThe penalty for the non-compliance with a bond is twice the amount\r\nof the money involved.\r\n\r\nIt is often required that the bond shall be further guaranteed by\r\none or more sureties. These sureties may be required to certify\r\nthat they are worth a certain sum, free and clear of all\r\nindebtedness.\r\n\r\nPersons holding positions of financial trust, whether public or\r\nprivate, may be, and most of them are, required to furnish bonds\r\nfor the faithful performance of their duties.\r\n\r\nIn the larger cities there are casualty and liability companies,\r\nwhich, for a fixed or annual consideration, act as sponsors on\r\nofficial and other forms of bond.\r\n\r\nWhere there are no such companies, as those just named, then\r\nprivate citizens of known responsibility must be secured to go on\r\nthe bond.\r\n\r\nIn every case the amount of the bond or security is measured by\r\nthe responsibilities of the man from whom it is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nLIFE INSURANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLife insurance may be defined to be \"A contract for the future\r\npayment of a certain sum of money to a person specified in the\r\nbody of the policy, on conditions dependent on the length of some\r\nparticular person's life.\"\r\n\r\nThere are two parties to this contract--the insured and the\r\ninsurer.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the insurer, if he take out the policy in his own\r\nname, is to provide in a measure for the care of his family, or\r\nother dependents, in the event of his death.\r\n\r\nAfter a long experience with the death rates in all lands that\r\nkeep mortuary statistics, the actuaries of insurance companies can\r\nnow estimate with surprising accuracy the probable length of life\r\nbefore any man of any age.\r\n\r\nThe methods of insurance companies mean to be scientific, but be\r\nthat as it may, they are certainly interesting.\r\n\r\nHOW IT IS DONE\r\n\r\nLet us take a young man of thirty, married, with one child, in\r\ngood health, and in receipt of a fair salary, but with no property\r\nto leave his wife and little one in the event of his death.\r\n\r\nTo secure his dear ones, he decides to insure his life for, let us\r\nsay, $3,000.\r\n\r\nHe fills out the blank, in which his age and all the other\r\nrequired information is given; then the insurance company's doctor\r\nexamines him and he is accepted as what is called \"a good risk.\"\r\n\r\nNow, from its actuary tables, the company knows, with reasonable\r\naccuracy, the number of years this young man should live, barring\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nAlready they have their tables of calculations for such cases.\r\nThey know what expense will be required in the way of rent,\r\nclerks, advertising, etc., to care for this case till the\r\nprospective, the inevitable end is reached.\r\n\r\nOn these calculations the immediate and all subsequent premiums or\r\npayments are based.\r\n\r\nThe insurance company invests and reinvests the premiums, and the\r\ntotal of these, it is estimated, will meet the expenses and the\r\namount of the policy at the time of its calculated expiration.\r\n\r\nAS AN INVESTMENT\r\n\r\nIf the young man in question had the money, he would find it to\r\nhis advantage to buy a paid up policy, that is one on which no\r\nfurther premiums would be required.\r\n\r\nBut, having the money for a paid up policy, could not the young\r\nman, without any expense for clerk hire or rent, invest it, and\r\nreinvest it with the interest, as long as he lived, and thus make\r\nby insuring himself?\r\n\r\nThere can be no question as to that, provided always that the\r\nyoung man lived out the calculated time, invested his insurance\r\nmoney at once, and kept on investing it in \"safe things\" as long\r\nas he lived. But how many young men are there who could or would\r\ntake this course?\r\n\r\nIt is much easier to save from our earnings than it is to invest\r\nthose earnings wisely.\r\n\r\nFORMS OF LIFE INSURANCE\r\n\r\nThe straight life policy, payable to the heirs at death, is the\r\nform in general use, but there are others.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another form, known as the \"endowment,\" which in\r\nitself combines the usual life insurance with some of the\r\nprivileges of a savings bank.\r\n\r\nThe endowment policy, while payable if death should occur before a\r\nfixed time, specifies the date when it shall be payable to the\r\ninsured himself, if he should live till that time.\r\n\r\nIn this case the family is secured, in the event of death, and the\r\ninsured has a guarantee for himself when he reaches life's\r\nunproductive years.\r\n\r\nThe premiums on an endowment policy are necessarily greater than\r\nthose on a regular life, and the premiums increase with the\r\nshortness of the time.\r\n\r\nMUTUAL INSURANCE SOCIETIES\r\n\r\nSeeing the vast sums accumulated by what are known as \"the old\r\nline companies,\" despite their high salaries and great expenses,\r\nworking men throughout the world, but more particularly in the\r\nUnited States, have banded together and formed mutual insurance\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThese companies, there are many of them, are known as societies,\r\nand their local branches are called \"lodges,\" \"councils\" or a\r\nsimilar name.\r\n\r\nProperly conducted, these mutual societies should be able to\r\nfurnish insurance at about actual cost, for the expenses of\r\nmanagement and collections are small.\r\n\r\nIt can be said that some of them have been and are being well\r\nmanaged, but others, like their predecessors, the old line\r\ncompanies, have unfortunately been conducted for the enrichment of\r\ntheir promoters.\r\n\r\nThe mutual insurance companies, like their more pretentious\r\nprototypes, are now placed under the supervision of inspectors in\r\nnearly all the states.\r\n\r\nAMOUNTS OF POLICIES\r\n\r\nIn the society companies, there is a limit to the amount, usually\r\n$3,000, for which one can be insured, but the regular companies\r\nhave no such limitation.\r\n\r\nIn the mutual insurance companies, the insured cannot leave his\r\ninsurance to his creditors, or to any one not within a certain\r\ndegree of kinship.\r\n\r\nIn the regular companies a man may insure for any amount he thinks\r\nhe can carry, and he can insure in the same way in any number of\r\ncompanies, and he can leave the money to any one he may select, or\r\nfor any purpose he may choose.\r\n\r\nSometimes the policy is made payable to unnamed executors. These\r\nmay be named in a will made after he has taken out his policy.\r\n\r\nPOLICIES AS SECURITY\r\n\r\nSometimes a man, without real estate or other personal assets,\r\ndesires to raise a loan on his life insurance, which, it should be\r\nsaid, is a form of personal property. In this case he may assign\r\nhis life policy, or his endowment policy, as security for the\r\nloan.\r\n\r\nAgain, if he is not insured and has no shadow of an asset, he may\r\nhave his life insured for the benefit of another, in consideration\r\nfor a loan.\r\n\r\nLAPSES\r\n\r\nWhen there is a failure to meet premiums, the policy is said to\r\n\"lapse\" or default.\r\n\r\nEven in this case the insured has an equity.\r\n\r\nEvery policy, depending on the amount paid, has what is known as a\r\n\"surrender value,\" and by proper process this may be collected\r\nfrom the company.\r\n\r\nIn some states, if the insured fails to meet his premiums, the\r\ncompany is compelled to pay on the policy at his death a sum\r\nequivalent to that which he paid before default.\r\n\r\nSome insurance policies have a clause stating that the contract\r\nwill be void in the event of the suicide of the holder. The\r\nhighest courts have set this clause aside. The ruling is that a\r\nsuicide is an insane man, and that his heirs should not be made to\r\nsuffer for his misfortune.\r\n\r\nPROPRIETARY AND MUTUAL COMPANIES\r\n\r\nThe larger insurance companies may be either proprietary or\r\nmutual, some are a combination of both.\r\n\r\nThe proprietary companies are corporations organized by a number\r\nof men to conduct life insurance as a business enterprise.\r\n\r\nSuch a company must be regularly chartered, and is under the\r\nsupervision of the state department of insurance.\r\n\r\nMutual companies, as the name implies, are organized and are meant\r\nto be managed for the benefit of the policy holders, who are also\r\nregarded as stock holders, with the right to vote in the election\r\nof officers and other company affairs.\r\n\r\nAiming to create a strong reserve fund to secure the policy\r\nholders, the mutual life insurance companies usually charge a\r\nlittle more in the way of premiums.\r\n\r\nMany rich men have their lives insured for great amounts. This is\r\ndone that their heirs may not be forced to break up the estate, at\r\ndeath, in order to settle the ordinary liabilities.\r\n\r\nIf it can be afforded, it is always well to carry some life\r\ninsurance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nFIRE AND ACCIDENT INSURANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hear and know much about life insurance because, no doubt, it\r\nhas to do directly with the individual, and so has a personal\r\nappeal; but there are other forms of insurance, forms that have to\r\ndo with things material, that play an important part in the\r\nworld's business.\r\n\r\nLIKE GAMBLING\r\n\r\nThe gambling spirit, like the desire for stimulants and the\r\ntobacco habit, seems to be well nigh universal.\r\n\r\nMen bet on the turn of dice, the cutting of cards, or the tossing\r\nof a coin, and we very properly denounce it as gambling. We take\r\nmoney without giving an equivalent, or we part with it and have\r\nnothing to show for the transfer.\r\n\r\nThere are insurance companies in England and in other parts of\r\nEurope where they insure risks from life to fire, from ships to\r\ncrops, and from the turning of a card to the tossing of a coin.\r\n\r\nThe English company, known the world over as \"Lloyd's,\" is ready\r\nto insure an ocean liner, or to guarantee that the next child born\r\ninto your family will be a boy or a girl; it will even insure that\r\nthere will or will not be twins, and that, if twins, they will be\r\nboys or girls, or one of each.\r\n\r\nNow, this looks like gambling, and you would be quite right in so\r\nclassing it, yet it is founded on the well considered law of\r\nchance, and the premiums--call them bets--are calculated with a\r\nmathematical precision surprising to one who has not studied the\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nWHAT IS FIRE INSURANCE?\r\n\r\nFire insurance is a contract between the insured and the company\r\ntaking the risk, in which for a consideration called a \"premium,\"\r\nthe company agrees to pay to the insured a stated sum, should the\r\nproperty, named in the policy, be destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nIf there should be a fire, during the life of the policy, and the\r\ndamage is not total, the company pays only enough to cover the\r\nloss.\r\n\r\nShould the property be totally destroyed the company pays up to\r\nthe amount named in the policy.\r\n\r\nNo company cares to insure for the full amount of the property;\r\nthat might be an incentive to incendiarism.\r\n\r\nIn taking a fire risk, the companies base their estimates on\r\ntables as carefully worked out and from experiences quite as well\r\nstudied as those of the actuaries of life companies.\r\n\r\nFire companies are purely business corporations, and their conduct\r\nis subject to the inspection of the officials of the state from\r\nwhich they receive their charters.\r\n\r\nPREMIUMS\r\n\r\nAs life companies have rates dependent on the age of the insured,\r\nso fire companies regulate their premiums by the location and\r\nother circumstances of the buildings; in other words, they\r\ncalculate the probabilities, and charge accordingly.\r\n\r\nThere are buildings particularly subject to combustion on which\r\nAmerican companies will not take a risk. Among these may be\r\nclassed kerosene and turpentine stills, sulphur and powder mills,\r\nand the buildings in which these products are stored.\r\n\r\nBuildings not used for the purposes named, but in close proximity\r\nto them, are often considered too dangerous to warrant the\r\nissuance of a policy.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the company makes a careful survey of the property\r\nto be insured, and on this report the amount of the premium is\r\nbased.\r\n\r\nPremiums on fire policies must be paid in bulk and in advance.\r\n\r\nPolicies should be renewed some days before the expiration of the\r\nold ones.\r\n\r\nFire premiums, taking into consideration the amount to be paid,\r\nare much lower than life premiums. We know that a man must die,\r\nbut a building may never burn down, therefore the risk is less.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING\r\n\r\nA man may insure in a dozen life insurance companies, and each\r\nmust pay the amount of the policy on his death, but not so with\r\nfire companies.\r\n\r\nA man owning a house worth, say ten thousand dollars, can insure\r\nit in ten companies, each taking a risk of eight thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIf this house burns down the man does not receive eighty thousand\r\ndollars. The actual loss is calculated and the companies divide it\r\nup, each paying its part.\r\n\r\nFire companies, while anxious to issue policies on every insurable\r\nhouse, are more than willing that their business rivals should do\r\nthe same, as in the event of fire the burden of loss will not be\r\nborne by one.\r\n\r\nAfter every fire the company's agent examines the damage and\r\nestimates what is saved. On this the payment is based.\r\n\r\nINSURABLE PROPERTY\r\n\r\nA building is classed as real estate, but personal property is\r\njust as liable to be destroyed by fire.\r\n\r\nFire policies can be secured on goods, furniture, machinery, live\r\nstock and other things, and the method is about the same as where\r\nbuildings are insured, but as a rule the premiums are higher, for\r\nsuch things are apt to be ruined by smoke and water, when the\r\nbuilding in which they are stored may not be much injured.\r\n\r\nMUTUAL COMPANIES\r\n\r\nMen can associate for any legal purpose, and mutual protection\r\nagainst loss by fire is one of these.\r\n\r\nIn many neighborhoods throughout the country, but particularly in\r\nthe eastern states, there are mutual insurance companies, usually\r\ncomposed of a number of men who know each other and who agree to\r\nshare the losses of a member, in proportions agreed to in advance.\r\n\r\nThis form of insurance is cheap and effective, but the field of\r\nits operations is necessarily limited.\r\n\r\nSTOCK COMPANIES\r\n\r\nThe stock companies start with a fixed capital, each member\r\nreceiving stock in proportion to the amount contributed.\r\n\r\nThe capital and the interest from it, after paying the necessary\r\nexpenses, is invested, and reinvested, till it often reaches a\r\nlarge sum.\r\n\r\nAt the end of every fiscal year, usually June 30th, the expenses\r\nand the losses paid are deducted from the earnings and the net\r\ngain may be divided as dividends.\r\n\r\nOften there are not only no dividends, but a great conflagration,\r\nlike that of San Francisco, may wipe out all the earnings, all the\r\nreserve and even the capital itself, leaving the company bankrupt\r\nand heavily in debt.\r\n\r\nGreat calamities cannot be foreseen. No actuary has yet appeared\r\nto forecast the acts of Providence, but on the whole our fire\r\ninsurance companies are well managed and prosperous.\r\n\r\nACCIDENT INSURANCE\r\n\r\nWe have insurance against storms, against the breaking of plate\r\nglass and even against loss from burglars, but the best known of\r\nthe minor insurance societies are those known as \"accident\r\ncompanies.\"\r\n\r\nAccident policies are of many kinds, and there is no reason why\r\nthe companies, under their charters, should not extend their risks\r\nindefinitely.\r\n\r\nAccidents against property are insured much as is destruction from\r\nfire, but the nature of the accident as \"hail,\" \"explosions,\"\r\n\"tornadoes\" and \"insect destruction\" must be specified in the\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nThe most popular form of accident policy is that which is sold to\r\ntravellers, and which can usually be had at the office where one\r\nbuys his ticket.\r\n\r\nThe method here is simple, and the purchase may be made in a\r\nminute. \"I want a policy for $1,000 for ten days,\" you say to the\r\nclerk. He tells you the amount, you pay and get your ticket, and\r\nthere you are.\r\n\r\nPrudent men have a stamped and addressed envelope ready. Into this\r\nthey push the policy, and the wife gets it. No, it does not\r\nstartle her. It is just Harry's prudence and she is used to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nPARTNERSHIPS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf properly conducted, there is much to commend the management of\r\na business through partners.\r\n\r\nNever go into a partnership with a man who puts in his experience\r\nagainst your capital, unless you know him like a brother.\r\n\r\n\"It lasted about a year,\" said a man who had done this. \"Now the\r\nfellow, who has cleared out, has the capital and I have the\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\nA partnership is an agreement between two or more persons to\r\nassociate for the purpose of carrying on a certain form of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nEach member of a copartnership must contribute a stated\r\ncontribution to the establishment of the enterprise, but each need\r\nnot give the same amount.\r\n\r\nNeither is it necessary that the contributions of each to the firm\r\nshall be of the same character.\r\n\r\nOne may contribute a building, another machinery, or material, and\r\nstill another money.\r\n\r\nThe shares in the profits are based on the cash values of the\r\ndifferent contributions.\r\n\r\nThe work of the different parties may be estimated as\r\ncontributions, but in such cases it is better to pay the worker a\r\nfixed compensation, and charge this to the expense account.\r\n\r\nPREPARE AND SIGN\r\n\r\nNever go into a partnership based on a verbal agreement, unless it\r\nbe for the distribution of fish, game or nuts, when out with a\r\nfriend for a holiday.\r\n\r\nHave the copartnership articles carefully drawn up and signed\r\nbefore you put a cent into the undertaking. A document like this\r\ncan be appealed to should disputes arise; and should a partner\r\ndie, his heirs may find it of the greatest value.\r\n\r\nThe articles should contain:\r\n\r\n1. The amount to be contributed by each.\r\n2. The nature of the business.\r\n3. The time which the partnership is to last.\r\n\r\nIf the time is not specified, a partner may withdraw whenever he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nIf the profits are to be equally divided, this should be stated\r\nand provided for.\r\n\r\nSILENT PARTNERS\r\n\r\nWhen a man invests money in a business in the management of which\r\nhe takes no active part, he is said to be a \"silent partner.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a partner has a share in the gains and he is responsible as\r\nthe others for the firm's liabilities.\r\n\r\nAgain, a man may not give money or time to a firm, but is willing,\r\nfor business reasons, that his name shall appear as if he were in\r\nthe association. In this case the man is known as a \"nominal\r\npartner.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough this man is not entitled to a share in the profits and\r\nhas no money invested, yet he can be held liable for the debts and\r\nother obligations. The reason for this is very plain.\r\n\r\nLIABILITY\r\n\r\nIn all matters rightly belonging to the business of a firm, any\r\nmember has the right to act, and his acts will be held binding in\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIt is usual for partners active in a business to have each his\r\nseparate duties, but even if these duties be designated in the\r\narticles of agreement, the outside business world is not supposed\r\nto know anything about the relative duties of the members of a\r\nfirm as decided among themselves, so it is decided that each is\r\nempowered to act for his partners.\r\n\r\nUnder the usual articles, it is stipulated that while a dual\r\npartnership lasts, neither of the members shall make a note, sign\r\na bond, or enter on any outside obligation as an individual\r\nwithout having secured the written consent of his business\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nEach partner in a firm is liable with the others for all the\r\nbusiness indebtedness.\r\n\r\nIf a firm fails, and the assets are found not sufficient to\r\nsatisfy the creditors, they can levy for satisfaction on the\r\nprivate property of one or all of the partners.\r\n\r\nIf a member of a firm should become so far indebted, as an\r\nindividual, that he cannot comply with his obligations, the\r\ninterest he holds in the firm may be disposed of and applied to\r\nthe payment of his debts.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean that the creditors may take or seize on any\r\nparticular thing which the firm holds jointly, but that the\r\ndebtor's interest in the concern may be so disposed of. All this\r\nthe law has provided for.\r\n\r\nA new partner admitted into a firm cannot be held responsible for\r\nthe debts of the old concern.\r\n\r\nHOW TO DISSOLVE\r\n\r\nEvery partnership agreement must provide for and distinctly state\r\nthe period for which it is to continue.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the period named, the partnership is dissolved by\r\nlimitation.\r\n\r\nIf the partnership is to continue, a new agreement must be made\r\nand signed.\r\n\r\nOn proper application, a partnership may be dissolved by an order\r\nof the court.\r\n\r\nIf a member who has become objectionable to his partners should\r\nnot agree to a dissolution of the firm, the partners may apply to\r\na court of competent jurisdiction for a decree of dissolution.\r\n\r\nNo member of a firm can withdraw at his own option. The consent of\r\nthe other partners is necessary, and before he is released he must\r\nprovide for his share of the obligations.\r\n\r\nNotice of dissolution should be published, and notices sent to\r\nagents and others interested.\r\n\r\nThe following is the customary form of notice:\r\n\r\n     The copartnership heretofore existing\r\n  between John Smith, Harry Roberts and\r\n  Thomas Allen, under the firm name of\r\n  Smith, Roberts & Co., is this day\r\n  dissolved by mutual consent.\r\n                            John Smith.\r\n                            Harry Roberts.\r\n                            Thomas Allen.\r\n  June 30, 1910.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL PARTNERSHIPS\r\n\r\nLimited or special partners are not recognized in some states.\r\n\r\nThis is a method of association whereby a person joins a\r\npartnership, putting in a sum agreed on, and which he may stand to\r\nlose as an investment. He is entitled to a _pro rata_ in the\r\nprofits, but he cannot be held for the debts.\r\n\r\nIn some countries marriage is regarded as a civil contract or form\r\nof partnership, subject to dissolution by the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nINVESTMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable fact that many men who have shown remarkable\r\nshrewdness in conducting a business in which a fortune may have\r\nbeen accumulated, exhibit the judgment of children when it comes\r\nto making investments.\r\n\r\nThere are able lawyers who have made fortunes in the practice of\r\nthe profession which they understood, only to lose them by\r\ninvestments in mines or other ventures, about which they knew\r\nabsolutely nothing but what was told them by the scheming\r\nspeculator and smooth-tongued promoter.\r\n\r\nAs has been intimated before in these pages, there is a great\r\ndifference between saving through and hoarding through a spirit of\r\nmiserliness.\r\n\r\nSAVINGS\r\n\r\nEvery wage or salary earner, no matter how small his compensation,\r\nshould try to lay by something of that little as a provision\r\nagainst the unproductive days.\r\n\r\nNo matter how small the amount a man has set aside, after paying\r\nfor life's necessities and meeting all just debts, he is to that\r\nextent a capitalist.\r\n\r\nThe miser would hide his savings out of reach, but the man with\r\nthe foresight to save will usually have the judgment to place\r\nthese savings where they will fructify and grow, producing the\r\nfruitage known as interest.\r\n\r\nThe young man or the young woman, or any one else who places his\r\nlittle accumulations in a savings bank, has begun a form of\r\ninvestment that may, if persisted in, place him or her above want,\r\neven if it does not entitle either to a place on the lists of\r\ngreat capitalists.\r\n\r\nCAPITALISTS\r\n\r\nThe capitalist not only has money of his own to invest, but he may\r\nand very often does need more money properly to exploit the\r\nenterprises in which he is engaged.\r\n\r\nMoney loaned to such men, after being assured of their ability and\r\nintegrity, is an advantage to the lender as it is to the user.\r\n\r\nThe lender's profit is assured if the enterprise does not fail,\r\nand the added capital not only insures against failure, but it may\r\nenable the manager to succeed beyond any expectations he could\r\nhave if forced to carry on the work with only his own resources.\r\n\r\nThe capitalist may choose to buy land in the suburbs of a city and\r\nbuild thereon a house to be sold or rented. This should always be\r\nmade to secure the money borrowed.\r\n\r\nA capitalist may establish a fund from which, on good security,\r\nthe business men of the community may obtain loans, for which they\r\nget a higher interest than that which they undertake to pay to\r\nthose whose money they are using.\r\n\r\nAgain a capitalist may undertake to loan to farmers, who have not\r\nthe means to carry on the work, but who are anxious to make their\r\nlands more productive, through drainage and crop rotation. In this\r\ncase the money loaned is secured by the usual bond and mortgage.\r\n\r\nOr it may be that another body of men is anxious to start a great\r\nmanufacturing enterprise in the neighborhood, but has not enough\r\nmoney to place the venture on a paying basis.\r\n\r\nIn the latter case it appeals to the capitalist, and he, though\r\nnot bearing enough available means of his own, undertakes the work\r\nwith the knowledge that he can rely on the small investors, whose\r\ncontributions he has before managed successfully.\r\n\r\nSTOCKHOLDERS\r\n\r\nOr it may be that the manufacturing company does not ask the\r\ncapitalist to assist, but itself goes to the small investor with a\r\nprospectus of the enterprise, and offers to sell stock in the\r\nconcern at $50 or $100 a share, as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThis gives a chance to enjoy the profits, be they great or small;\r\nbut with the chance for larger profits there comes the greater\r\nrisk which must always be assumed in such cases.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when a company is starting, its stock may be put below\r\npar. This stock, in the event of success, may appreciate, as with\r\nsome bank and other corporation stocks, many times above the par\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nWhen stocks sell in the open market for their face value, they are\r\nsaid to be at par.\r\n\r\nKINDS OF STOCKS\r\n\r\nMost companies, organized on a stock basis, issue stocks of two\r\nkinds. One is known as \"common\" the other as \"preferred.\"\r\n\r\nAs the name implies, preferred stock (its rate of interest is\r\nalways fixed) is entitled to be paid out of the net dividends\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nWhatever is left after paying the preferred stock interest is\r\ndivided up equally among the shares of common stock, each getting\r\naccording to his holdings.\r\n\r\nSometimes the dividends on common stock are far greater than those\r\non the preferred. The preferred stock dividends are regarded as a\r\nfixed charge, but there can be no limit as to the payments on the\r\ncommon stock, if the funds are available.\r\n\r\nThe stocks of railroads, factories, banks and other enterprises\r\nmay be good forms of investment, and for this they are often held\r\nfor long periods by investors for revenue.\r\n\r\nMost stocks, however, particularly of railroads, are continually\r\nchanging hands. The buying and selling of such securities has\r\ngrown to be an enormous business, managed largely by men known as\r\n\"stock brokers,\" many of whom are strong factors in the financial\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the buying and selling of stocks through brokers is a\r\nhazardous form of speculation, which has in it all the elements of\r\ngambling, and we cannot advise too strongly against it.\r\n\r\nThere is another kind of stock, which some companies keep in their\r\nsafes to meet an emergency. This is known as \"treasury stock,\"\r\nand, like the preferred, its rate of interest is fixed.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a company is capitalized and prints stock to\r\nthe amount of $100,000.\r\n\r\nThis company sells $80,000 worth, and the officers believe that\r\nthey can force the enterprise to success with the money on hand.\r\n\r\nNow, it follows that, with the same amount of earnings, the\r\nprofits on $80,000 will be greater than on $100,000, so the\r\n$20,000 unsold stock is held in reserve.\r\n\r\nIf to extend the business, or for any other reason, it is\r\nnecessary to have more money, the treasury stock may be sold to\r\nsecure the extra capital.\r\n\r\nIf the business is placed on a basis where its success is beyond\r\nall question, then the treasury stock may be divided _pro rata_\r\nbetween the holders of the other stock, for, till disposed of in\r\nsome way, it was an asset common to the whole company.\r\n\r\nEach stock certificate tells when dividends are declared; they may\r\nbe paid quarterly, half yearly, or annually.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nBONDS AS INVESTMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best way in which savings can be invested is to use them in\r\nthe extension of the business in which they were made.\r\n\r\nThe wage earner and the man on a salary cannot, of course, do\r\nthis, but the farmer, the small tradesman, and the mechanic, who\r\nis his own employer, may be able to do so. And so, before looking\r\nfor a field for investment outside, such men should look about\r\nthem and consider how best the money may be used right on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAS TO BONDS\r\n\r\nBut after considering the points suggested, the man who has some\r\nmoney may not be able to find a secure and profitable place for it\r\nin or near his own home. One of the safest forms of investments is\r\nbonds, though, as with other forms of security, the rate of\r\ninterest declines as the margin of safety increases.\r\n\r\nIf a well-established stock company should wish for any reason to\r\nincrease its available cash, it may issue bonds, or certificate of\r\nindebtedness, bearing from four to five per cent interest, payable\r\nsemi-annually.\r\n\r\nThese bonds may be transferred the same as stock. They are a good\r\nform of security when it is desired to borrow money from the bank,\r\nand for many purposes they are as available as so much cash.\r\n\r\nSuch bonds are issued for a specified number of years and have\r\ncoupons attached, which are cut off when interest is due, and\r\npresented to the treasurer of the company for payment.\r\n\r\nThese bonds are secured by a mortgage or deed of trust on all the\r\nproperty of the corporation they represent.\r\n\r\nTo redeem these bonds, when due, the company annually sets apart a\r\nsum, known as a \"Sinking fund,\" for their redemption.\r\n\r\nSuch bonds are far safer than any form of the company's stock, for\r\nthey bear interest that must be met, whether or not dividends are\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nAs with a real estate mortgage, the property pledged in the bond\r\nshould be defined.\r\n\r\nRAILROAD BONDS\r\n\r\nEvery railroad in the country has been built and equipped by the\r\nsale of its bonds. In such cases amounts of stock of the same, or\r\napproximately the face value of the bond, have been given to the\r\npurchaser as a bonus or inducement. Of course, the controlling\r\nstock is always retained by the promoters; and it is through the\r\nrepresentation of this stock that all the business of the\r\ncorporation is carried on.\r\n\r\nThe cases are few where any money was paid directly for the\r\noriginal issue of any railroad stock.\r\n\r\nBonds sold to build a road are usually known as \"construction\"\r\nbonds. There may be another bond issue for equipment--with a stock\r\nbonus--and still other bonds, each series stating the property\r\npledged and the purpose for which the money from sales is to be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe _Christian Herald_, in one of its recent financial articles,\r\nclearly defines this species of bonds, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Railroad bonds are usually pledged by the President and Treasurer\r\nof the railroad and by the Trustees, to whom the bonds are made\r\nout, and who must defend the rights of bondholders, should the\r\ncompany fail to meet any of the obligations it undertook in the\r\nmortgage deed.\r\n\r\n\"In other words, a bond is the Corporation's promissory note for\r\nthe money originally paid by the investor, with interest for the\r\nsame, to be paid to the investor in stated amounts at stated\r\nintervals; and to guarantee its good faith in the matter, the\r\nCompany pledges the bondholder an interest in certain property in\r\nits possession. It follows that a bond has a first call upon the\r\nproperty rights of the corporation; that it represents something\r\ntangible; that it pays a definite amount of interest, and that it\r\nmay be reduced at its full value at a certain time.\"\r\n\r\nBUYING BONDS\r\n\r\nBonds, like wheat, have their selling prices quoted from day to\r\nday, and they are equally a thing of purchase and sale.\r\n\r\nThere are banks and brokerage firms that make a specialty of\r\nbonds, and most of these houses are entirely reliable; still, the\r\nnovice in such things would do well to investigate for himself\r\nbefore investing in any bond recommended by any seller.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of the seller to sell; it should be equally the\r\npurpose of the buyer not to be \"sold.\"\r\n\r\nOur government, state and municipal bonds speak for themselves,\r\nand in the main require no examination as to the security, though\r\nthere have been cities and even states that have defaulted in\r\ntheir payments.\r\n\r\nBond houses and banks of established reputation cannot afford to\r\ndeceive; they receive their compensation in the way of commissions\r\non sales, and their characterization of the bonds may be accepted\r\nwithout question, for they invariably investigate the bonds,\r\nbefore they lend their names to them by offering them for sale.\r\n\r\nIf there is any doubt in the mind of the would be purchaser as to\r\nthe character of the seller, that should be the first thing\r\ninvestigated.\r\n\r\nWhat the buyer must satisfy himself of is:\r\n\r\n1. Who is the seller?\r\n2. What do the bonds represent?\r\n3. Are they negotiable? and\r\n4. Can they be sold again for about their face value?\r\n\r\nEvery one who has saved money, it is to be supposed, has a bank\r\naccount and is acquainted with the president of his local bank.\r\nWhen in doubt, the advice of such a man may be of great help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHINGS TO REMEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a man is making a living he should not change his business\r\nafter he has passed middle life, unless, indeed, he has a\r\nguarantee that the new venture will be greatly to his advantage.\r\n\r\nThe best business for the average man is that which affords him\r\nthe most pleasure in carrying it on, or at least with which he is\r\nmost familiar.\r\n\r\nHappiness in one's work means far more than the accumulation of a\r\nfortune in discomfort.\r\n\r\nDON'T DECEIVE YOURSELF\r\n\r\nHaving made your credit and business standing good, keep them good\r\nby an adherence to the same course.\r\n\r\nIf you can avoid it, do not loan your name to every needy friend\r\nthat comes along. Your neighbors question your good judgment every\r\ntime you have to meet a note which you were coaxed into endorsing.\r\nYou would have saved yourself by loaning the money outright.\r\n\r\nDo not deceive yourself into the belief that you are making money\r\nwhen, as a matter of fact, you may be losing.\r\n\r\nYou buy an article for two dollars and sell it for two and a half,\r\nand you say to yourself: \"There is fifty cents made.\" But is it?\r\nLet us see.\r\n\r\nBefore crediting your business with that fifty cents, you should\r\nhave considered these points.\r\n\r\n1. The loss of interest on that two dollars.\r\n2. Your own time or other time paid for.\r\n3. The capital invested in things not sold.\r\n4. The rent.\r\n5. The transportation, insurance, heat, light, bad accounts,\r\nunsalable goods, taxes, public donations, and the flood of items\r\nthat go to swell the outlay of every merchant, whether in the\r\ngreat city or at the country crossroads.\r\n\r\nWEEDING OUT\r\n\r\nEvery man in trade should make an inventory of his stock at least\r\nonce a year. Having done this, he should give his stock a fresh\r\nappearance, whether new goods be added or not, by relegating to\r\nthe scrap heap, cellar or the garret all the dingy, dirty,\r\ndisreputable stuff that he could not sell or give away, and which\r\nhas induced sore eyes whenever seen.\r\n\r\nKeep a stock book.\r\n\r\nQuite as important as keeping the stock in order is keeping the\r\nbooks in good shape.\r\n\r\nAt least once a year the books should be weeded out. Why carry as\r\nbills collectable accounts which you have been assured, for years,\r\nwould never be paid?\r\n\r\nWipe them out and charge them to profit and loss.\r\n\r\nWhere machinery is used, it is a good plan to charge off every\r\nyear ten per cent of the cost; this to make good the loss from\r\nwear and tear.\r\n\r\nIt is only by annual house cleanings and account clearings that\r\nyou can tell about how you stand.\r\n\r\nLET YOUR WIFE KNOW\r\n\r\nIt is usually wise for a woman, married or single, to keep her\r\nreal estate and her money, if she have any, in her own name. So\r\nalso with property bought with her money.\r\n\r\nIn these cases the woman should deal with her husband, or the\r\nmembers of her family, the same as she would with strangers with\r\nwhom she is transacting business.\r\n\r\nSome may say that this suggests a want of confidence and a lack of\r\nthat affection that should exist between husband and wife or near\r\nkinsfolk. Such an objection is sheer sentimentality. Be as open\r\nhanded and generous as you will with your loved ones, but when it\r\ncomes to business, let the work be done in a strictly business way\r\nor not at all.\r\n\r\nMany a good business has gone to ruin after the death of the owner\r\nand manager because he had kept his wife in blank ignorance of his\r\naffairs and the way in which he conducted them.\r\n\r\nMany a business, that just dragged along till the death of the\r\nmanager, has sprung into new life when the widow took charge. This\r\nmust in part be credited to natural ability and inborn pluck and\r\nenergy, but even these gifts could not have availed if the woman\r\nhad been left in ignorance of business methods.\r\n\r\nWomen, like men, are awkward in new positions, not so much from a\r\nwant of ability as a lack of experience.\r\n\r\nPut the average man suddenly in charge of a house, and he will\r\nsoon demonstrate his helplessness. The woman's deftness comes from\r\nher experience.\r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible, every husband should post his wife as to\r\nhis methods of doing business.\r\n\r\nHe should not keep her ignorant of his financial affairs.\r\n\r\nIf he conceal from her the amount of his secure holdings, it may\r\nbe that he hopes to surprise her at his death, or long before that\r\nevent. But if he have any regard for his family, he should not\r\nhide from her the obligations which may spell ruin if the wife is\r\nnot prepared in advance to meet them.\r\n\r\nWhether the husband lives or dies, the wife must still care for\r\nthe children and attend to her never-lessening household duties.\r\nThink of her as taking on the added burdens of a business of which\r\nshe is ignorant.\r\n\r\nThere are many prosperous husbands to whom what has just been said\r\nwill not apply, but if you should ask them the secret of their\r\nsuccess they will not hesitate to tell you that when they married\r\nthey took their wives into full partnership, business secrets and\r\nall.\r\n\r\nCHILDREN AND BUSINESS\r\n\r\nWhen you send your children to school it is that the training\r\nthere received may qualify them to fight the better the ceaseless\r\nlife battle.\r\n\r\nOf course, we should not regard all education from a business\r\nviewpoint. Money apart, learning is its own greatest reward.\r\n\r\nIt widens the horizon at every step, and lifts the soul into\r\nstrength and a profounder worship. But it will not do to overlook\r\nthe business side of the training which the child should receive\r\nin school and out of it.\r\n\r\nIt is all very well to teach children the sources of the family\r\nrevenue and the way to secure it. It is right that they should be\r\nimpressed with the dignity of labor and trained in the ways of\r\nearning money, but it is far more important that they should be\r\ntaught how to spend money, so as to get the most good from it,\r\nonce it is earned.\r\n\r\nThe boy or girl is in a safe way to learn self-control and build\r\nup character when he or she, with some nickels at command, can\r\npass a candy or a fruit shop without being compelled to spend\r\ntheir cash assets.\r\n\r\nChildren, wherever it is possible, should be given opportunities\r\nfor earning money, which they can feel is \"really and truly\" their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nThey should not be made to feel that the money is not actually\r\ntheirs, to do with as they please, but they should be taught self-\r\ndenial, and that they must not get rid of their earnings by the\r\npurchase of things not needed.\r\n\r\nOn the farm, children unconsciously learn much through occasional\r\nwork and constant observation, but away from the farm, boys and\r\ngirls are apt to know little or nothing of the work in which the\r\nfather, the bread winner, is engaged.\r\n\r\nWhere it is possible, the children should be made familiar by\r\nactual contact with the father's work.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge may never be used, still it will have value as a\r\nfactor in the child's training, for in our modern life all\r\nbusiness is inter-related.\r\n\r\nLet the youngsters know something about banks by entrusting them\r\nthere when old enough.\r\n\r\nTeach them to keep accounts of their own little money affairs,\r\ntheir earnings, their expenditures, and their balances.\r\n\r\nIf they should borrow, even a cent, see that they return it at the\r\ntime agreed on. Impress on them the fact that debt is a burden\r\nwhich it is well to get rid of as soon as possible, if one would\r\nstand erect and be entirely free.\r\n\r\nAll this can be quietly inculcated into the mind of the child\r\nwithout making him old-fashioned or miserly. The more he knows of\r\nthe world the more he can enjoy it in a wholesome way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nWORTH KNOWING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf things are said in this chapter that seem like a repetition of\r\nthings already told, it is that their importance warrants a\r\nrepetition in another form.\r\n\r\nOVER-GENEROSITY\r\n\r\n\"There are no pockets in a shroud,\" it is said. True it is that we\r\ncannot take material things with us to the other side of the\r\ngrave, and so before the end comes it is well to make preparations\r\nfor their disposition.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of getting possession of property:\r\n\r\n1. To have it given.\r\n2. To earn it.\r\n3. To steal it.\r\n\r\nWe shall not consider the last method; that is the business of the\r\nlaw, but let us look at the first.\r\n\r\nProperty is given in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. By direct gift from one to another.\r\n2. By will, when the amount is payable on the death of the donor.\r\n\r\nOf course, the widow and children, if there be any, are first to\r\nbe considered in either of the cases named.\r\n\r\nMany people, when the end is nearing, think that it is better to\r\nmake sure that their wealth will reach the right hands by giving\r\nit direct and at once.\r\n\r\nNow, no matter the nobility of the motive that prompts such an\r\nact, it is one which, on the whole, cannot be commended.\r\n\r\nIt is all very well to spend available means in order to set a son\r\nor daughter up in business, but such sums, if there are other\r\nheirs, should be charged against the share of the probable donee,\r\nwith interest, and a record made of the same.\r\n\r\nUnder no circumstances should old people, who, after raising a\r\nfamily and living honorable lives, have saved enough to own their\r\nhome and secure an income for their declining years, deed or give\r\nthis property to their children, or to any one else, in\r\nconsideration of their having all their subsequent wants met.\r\n\r\nThe better way for the farmer, the merchant, or the manufacturer,\r\nwhen he feels the years pressing heavily and that he can no longer\r\nattend properly to the old demands on him, is to shift by a\r\nproperly drawn contract the business management of the enterprise\r\nto his children, or to those whom he wishes to place in charge.\r\n\r\nIn this way the ownership is not changed, and if the new\r\nmanagement should prove to be inefficient, it can be placed in\r\nmore efficient hands.\r\n\r\nCARE OF WILLS\r\n\r\nAs has been said, every person having property of any kind to\r\ndispose of should make a will.\r\n\r\nAlready ways have been given as to how wills should be made and\r\nestates administered, but to these it may be well to add another\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nDo not imagine that the making of a will shortens life.\r\n\r\nToo often, after the demise of a testator who it is known has made\r\na will, the heirs cannot find the document, and the lawyer who\r\ndrew it knows nothing more about it.\r\n\r\nMany men leave their wills with their lawyers. If this should not\r\nbe done, then it would be well to keep it in the safe of the bank\r\nin which the testator has his account.\r\n\r\nBut whether in these places or another, there should be no doubt\r\nas to the existence of a will, or the place in which it may be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nOnly the last will should be kept; all preceding wills should be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nCARE OF PAPERS\r\n\r\nWhile writing about the care of wills, we are struck with the\r\nrecollection that wills are not the only papers of value that are\r\napt to be mislaid or lost.\r\n\r\nNever pay out money without taking a receipt, and never receive\r\nmoney without giving one.\r\n\r\nYou are not responsible for the care of the receipts you give, but\r\nyou certainly are for the receipts you receive.\r\n\r\nThe trained business man has a place for everything, but there is\r\nno reason why the man not so well trained should have to turn his\r\nshop or his home upside down every time he wants a paper that\r\nproves he has paid a bill, which he must pay again if that receipt\r\nis lost.\r\n\r\nEverything may be regarded as \"lost\" that cannot be found, even if\r\nyou are sure \"it is about somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nNo valuable paper should be \"about.\" The only place for it is just\r\nwhere you can lay your hand on it when wanted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to keeping your papers where they can be found the\r\ninstant they are wanted, see to it that every paper is self-\r\nexplanatory and clear of meaning on the face of it.\r\n\r\nCHECKS AND STUBS\r\n\r\nIt has been advised that the stub be always filled out before the\r\ncheck, and that the check be then copied from the stub. This\r\ncourse will greatly lessen the chances of disagreement between the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nWhen the last check in the book has been filled and torn out, do\r\nnot throw away the stubs. They contain important data and may be\r\nof use in proving payment should a question arise.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, never destroy the cancelled checks handed you by\r\nthe cashier when your bank account has been balanced. Each of\r\nthese checks, if drawn to order as it should be, is a receipt, a\r\nvoucher, for some payment that may possibly be demanded again.\r\n\r\nBe on the safe side.\r\n\r\nSENDING AWAY MONEY\r\n\r\nIt may be well to repeat again, in more condensed form, just how\r\nmoney may be safely sent to a distance.\r\n\r\n1. By bank draft, payable to your order and endorsed over to the\r\nperson whom you wish to pay. The party receiving the draft must\r\nendorse it before he can collect, and this endorsement is a\r\nreceipt for the money, as the cancelled draft must eventually come\r\ninto your possession.\r\n2. You can buy an express order up to fifty dollars, but you may\r\nsend money in a package to any amount. Only banks or large dealers\r\nin money do this. Like the bank draft, the express order must be\r\nendorsed by the receiver, and the express company returns it to\r\nyou, when it becomes a receipt.\r\n3. By post office orders, up to one hundred dollars.\r\n4. By postal notes, in small amounts.\r\n5. By telegraph.\r\n6. By transmitting a personal check.\r\n7. By a trusted messenger authorized to get a receipt.\r\n\r\nThe bank draft is the very best way of transmitting money.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, drafts can be bought at any bank, and they\r\nshould always be made payable to your order.\r\n\r\nYou want to pay a bill of goods to Lloyd, Smith and Company, New\r\nYork, so you sign on the back of your draft for the amount:\r\n\r\n      Pay to the order of\r\n  Lloyd, Smith and Company,\r\n      Henry C. Robbins.\r\n\r\nLloyd, Smith and Company must endorse the draft before it can be\r\ncashed. The draft, after payment, is returned to you, and it\r\nbecomes the best form of receipt.\r\n\r\nLOST IN MAILS\r\n\r\nWere you ever at the Dead Letter Office in Washington? If you have\r\nnever paid such a visit, you can form no conception of the tons,\r\nthe hundreds of thousands of letters and parcels that are lost\r\nevery year in the mails.\r\n\r\nUnaccounted for drafts, checks, postal orders, books, jewelry,\r\nmedicine, everything, indeed, that the mails will agree to carry,\r\nmay be found piled in that cemetery of lost communications, the\r\nDead Letter Office.\r\n\r\nHave you added to the mortuary list?\r\n\r\nAll these deaths, like many of living creatures, are due to\r\ncarelessness.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the sender is to blame. He has misdirected. He has\r\nplaced papers not properly folded in the envelope and then\r\nneglected to seal it. He has neglected to write any address at\r\nall, and dropped the letter into the box. Again he has addressed\r\nthe parcel, but neither men nor angels can decipher the writing.\r\n\r\nMORE ABOUT NOTES\r\n\r\nThe note, as has been said, is one of the most usual forms of\r\nobligation, yet misunderstandings often arise as to its\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\nHere are the points that must be attended to, nor shall we offer\r\nany excuse for repeating them collectively:\r\n\r\n1. The date and amount must be so plainly written as to leave no\r\ndoubt as to either.\r\n2. The rate of interest, if any, must be clearly expressed.\r\n3. The post office address of the signer or signees must be\r\nwritten opposite the name.\r\n4. The note should be made payable at a definite place and on a\r\ndefinite date.\r\n5. In taking a note or other obligation from a person who cannot\r\nwrite, be sure to have his \"x\" mark witnessed.\r\n\r\nShould you receipt certificates of stock as security for the\r\npayment of a note, or the payment of any other debt, be sure to\r\nnotify the company issuing them.\r\n\r\nIn giving this notice, which should be done at once, state clearly\r\nthe number of shares you hold, the number of the certificates and\r\nto whom issued.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of this rule will depend altogether on the\r\ncharacter of the person with whom you are dealing.\r\n\r\nNever, if you can help it, buy a past due note, especially if it\r\nis not secured by a mortgage.\r\n\r\nIf a note, which a third party has endorsed, becomes due, never\r\nagree to an extension of time without getting the written consent\r\nof the endorser.\r\n\r\nMany men have lost through their ignorance of this essential\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nLOOK BEFORE YOU LEAP\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are not quite through with the note.\r\n\r\nWhen making a payment of principal or interest on a note, be sure\r\nto take a receipt for the amount, stating specifically what the\r\npayment is to be credited to. In addition, if it be possible, see\r\nthat the sum paid be endorsed on the back of the note itself.\r\n\r\nThe endorsement of the sum paid on the back of the note bars its\r\nbeing negotiated for more than the amount actually due.\r\n\r\nSometimes the owner and the maker of a note live at points some\r\ndistance apart. If you were the maker of the note, and wanted to\r\nmake a payment, but wished to avoid the expense and annoyance of a\r\ntrip, what should be done?\r\n\r\nIn this case a good plan would be to write to the owner of the\r\nnote, asking him to send it by a certain bank in your neighborhood\r\nwhere you can pay. The bank will receive the cash, make the\r\nendorsement in your presence, and then send its check for the\r\namount with the note to the owner.\r\n\r\nYou must pay the cost of this transaction.\r\n\r\nOr you may send the amount to be credited on your note, through a\r\nbank draft, as already indicated.\r\n\r\nNever destroy a cancelled note.\r\n\r\nNOTES IN BANK\r\n\r\nIf you have money at a bank your note will form the chief evidence\r\nof indebtedness and be the paper for which the security is\r\npledged.\r\n\r\nKeep careful track of the date of payment and the amount. There\r\nmust be no neglect or carelessness.\r\n\r\nNever permit your note to go to protest.\r\n\r\nIf for any reason payment cannot be made at the time fixed, then\r\nthe better way is to go, as soon as this is learned, to the bank\r\nor other holder of the note, and frankly explain the situation.\r\n\r\nBankers are not shylocks. They realize that good and responsible\r\nmen are often disappointed in their collections, or in the payment\r\nof a sum on which they depended for the settlement of their\r\naccount with the bank, and in such a case they are usually willing\r\nto grant an extension.\r\n\r\nPrivate individuals, as note holders, should be treated in just\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\nWELL TO KNOW\r\n\r\nWhen calling at a bank for your note, always give the exact date\r\non which the note falls due.\r\n\r\nIf the note belongs to another party, and is held by the bank for\r\ncollection, then mention the name of the person to whom it was\r\noriginally given.\r\n\r\nIf the bank has sent you a written notice about the note, take the\r\nnotice with you. It will be found to contain all the desired\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nBanks keep their own notes in one place and those of their\r\ncustomers in another.\r\n\r\nBanks keep each date by itself, and can so find required notes\r\nmore readily if the owner's names and the dates are given.\r\n\r\nDISCHARGING LIENS\r\n\r\nRemember a mortgage is a lien or security given for the payment of\r\na note.\r\n\r\nIf you get a mortgage, have it recorded at once.\r\n\r\nIf you pay off a mortgage, take it at once to the office of record\r\nand have the discharge of the instrument properly entered on the\r\nfolio in which the mortgage is recorded.\r\n\r\nMany lawsuits have resulted from the temporary neglect of this\r\nimportant duty.\r\n\r\nBE PROMPT, BUT NOT TOO PROMPT\r\n\r\nSometimes a man will give a number of notes and secure them by one\r\nmortgage.\r\n\r\nThe notes may pass into the hands of a number of people.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that you hold one note and the mortgage, and that\r\nthe mortgagee comes to you and tenders the amount of your note,\r\nshould you then surrender the mortgage to him?\r\n\r\nBy no means, until the last note is paid that mortgage remains as\r\nsecurity, and the holder of it is responsible for its safety to\r\nthe holders of the other notes.\r\n\r\nIn such a case it is better to have the mortgage held by one party\r\nfor the protection of all.\r\n\r\nBE IN NO HASTE TO INVEST\r\n\r\nWhen a person not accustomed to managing money comes into the\r\npossession of a sum that it is not safe to carry about in the\r\npocket, what should he do with it?\r\n\r\nObviously the first answer to this question must be \"He should put\r\nit in the bank.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already given hints as to investments, and to these it is\r\nnot necessary to refer again, we are now considering another and\r\nnot an unusual phase of such a case.\r\n\r\nYoung men and women of all ages are very apt to be inexperienced\r\nin these matters. As soon as it becomes known that such people\r\nhave come into the possession of a goodly amount of cash, which\r\nthey are not considered competent to manage, it is surprising how\r\npast acquaintances suddenly pose as old and unselfish friends,\r\neach with a scheme for doubling the money while the owner is\r\nlooking at it.\r\n\r\nNow, there may be good, honest friends who are eager to advise and\r\nhelp in a case of this kind, but they are sure to be outnumbered\r\nby advisers who have their own little axes to grind.\r\n\r\nOur advice is \"Don't be in a hurry to invest. Your cash is quite\r\nsafe while in bank.\"\r\n\r\nBut no matter how promising, do not invest your money in a\r\nbusiness you know nothing about, even if it does carry with it a\r\nposition and a salary.\r\n\r\nFind a good honest lawyer, despite sneers to the contrary, we\r\nbelieve most men in the profession are of this character, and ask\r\nhis advice, and pay for his help if papers are to be drawn.\r\n\r\nBuying rentable real estate is usually a good investment, provided\r\nalways that the price is reasonable, the title clear, and the\r\nchances of its advancement pretty certain.\r\n\r\nMEET YOUR DUES PROMPTLY\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that every man and woman in the United States\r\nbelongs to one or more societies of some character, and this is\r\nnot an overstatement.\r\n\r\nEvery member of such an organization is such by reason of election\r\nand the payment of dues.\r\n\r\nIf you are a member of, or a pledged contributor to, a church,\r\nlodge, grange, or other society, you should regard the prompt\r\npayment of your dues as sacred as any other form of obligation.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of a properly conducted church are always\r\nconsiderable, even in small communities. It is a disgrace to the\r\nChristian organization that, after forcing down the pastor's\r\ncompensation to the barest cost of life's necessities, then force\r\nhim to run into debt if he and his family would live, or to be\r\nforced continually to remind the trustees that his salary is far\r\nin arrears.\r\n\r\nIf you belong to a lodge or other society, leave it if you\r\nhonestly feel that you cannot afford the dues. Neglect to do this\r\nand your name will be dropped from the rolls on which it never\r\nshould have been placed.\r\n\r\nCOUNTING MONEY\r\n\r\nNever receive money from any one without counting it. Count it at\r\nonce and in the presence of the giver.\r\n\r\nLet it make no difference, banker, merchant, kinsman or friend, do\r\nnot fear to give offence, but right then and there, count the\r\nmoney he gave you.\r\n\r\nOf course, these people are honest, but did it ever occur to you\r\nthat honest people often make mistakes?\r\n\r\nWhenever you pay another money, if he does not do so himself, you\r\nshould insist that he count it in your presence.\r\n\r\nIf you do this you won't lose a friend, but if you do not do it\r\nyou may make an enemy, should the man come back to say you made a\r\nmistake and underpaid him, and you very properly refuse to honor\r\nhis claim.\r\n\r\nREADY MONEY\r\n\r\nDo not, if you can possibly avoid it, keep money around your\r\nhouse, in your place of business, or on your person.\r\n\r\nThe professional thief is ever on the watch for chances to take\r\nunto himself all the money in sight.\r\n\r\nPickpockets reap their harvest from money carriers.\r\n\r\nThe burglar may steal or fire may destroy money left in the house.\r\n\r\nA bank, if not near one then a safe, is the best place for money,\r\nthough safes have been broken into and robbed.\r\n\r\nDo not make a display of money at any time, but particularly in a\r\npublic place.\r\n\r\nIf you are drawing money from a bank, count it quickly and\r\nquietly, then secure it in an inside pocket that cannot be reached\r\nwithout unbuttoning.\r\n\r\nNever cash a check for a man whom you do not know to be square.\r\n\r\nThe same applies to the endorsement of checks.\r\n\r\nIN TRAVELLING\r\n\r\nAlways be courteous in travelling, but never take the chance\r\nacquaintance of the steamboat or car into your confidence.\r\n\r\nKeep an eye on the man who \"fortunately is going just your way.\"\r\n\r\nWatch out for the fellow who knows the leading men of your town\r\nand is a cousin of Judge Smith.\r\n\r\nDo not respond if such men ask you to cash a small check or make a\r\nslight advance till his draft arrives.\r\n\r\nDo not accept the invitation of strangers to visit any place.\r\n\r\nAvoid the confidence of the over-dressed, but slightly intoxicated\r\nyoung fellow who \"has been out with college chums.\" He is not a\r\ncollege man, nor has he been drinking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nCONTRACTIONS AND SIGNS USED IN BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"         Italian ditto--The same as above.\r\n°         Degrees.\r\n'         Primes, Minutes, Test.\r\n\"         Seconds, Inches.
