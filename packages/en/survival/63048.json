Yet they had to exist, had\r\n            to build a new life on a hostile world. And the\r\n           man who assumed command was Gregory Malcolm, the\r\n             bespectacled secretary--whose only adventures\r\n                 had come through the pages of a book.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n                      Planet Stories Spring 1944.\r\n         Extensive research did not uncover any evidence that\r\n         the U.S. copyright on this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSparks snapped off the switches and followed him to the door of the\r\nradio turret. Sparks was a stunted, usually-grinning, little redhead\r\nnamed Hannigan. But he wasn't grinning now. He laid an anxious hand on\r\nGreg's arm. \"If I was you,\" he said, \"if I was you, Malcolm, I don't\r\nthink I'd say nothing to the boss about this. Not just yet, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nSparks spluttered and fussed and made heavy weather of answering.\r\n\r\n\"Well, for one thing, it ain't important. It would only worry him. And\r\nthen there's the womenfolks, they scare easy. Which of course they\r\nain't no cause to. Atmospherics don't mean nothing. I've rode out\r\nworse storms than this--plenty of times. And in worse crates than the\r\n_Carefree_.\"\r\n\r\nGreg studied him carefully from behind trim plasta-rimmed spectacles.\r\nHe drew a deep breath. He said levelly, \"So it's _that_ bad, eh,\r\nSparks?\"\r\n\r\n\"What bad? I just told you--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. Sparks, I'm not a professional spaceman. But I've studied\r\nastrogation as few Earthlubbers have. It's been my hobby for years. And\r\nI think I know what we're up against.\r\n\r\n\"We hit a warp-eddy last night. We've been trapped in a vortex for\r\nmore than eight hours. Lord only knows how many hundreds of thousands\r\nof miles we've been borne off our course. And now we've blasted into a\r\nsuper-ionized belt of atmospherics. Your radio signals are blanketed.\r\nYou can't get signals in or out. We're a deaf-mute speck of metal being\r\nwhirled headlong through space. Isn't that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what--\" began Sparks hotly. Then he stopped, studied his\r\ncompanion thoughtfully, nodded. \"O.Q.,\" he confessed, \"that's it. But\r\nwe ain't licked yet. We got three good men on the bridge. Townsend ...\r\nGraves ... Langhorn. They'll pull out of this if anybody can. And they\r\nain't no sense in scaring the Old Man and his family.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't tell them,\" said Greg. \"I won't tell them unless I have to.\r\nBut between you and me, what are the odds against us, Sparks?\"\r\n\r\nThe radioman shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"Who knows? Vortices are unpredictable. Maybe the damn thing will toss\r\nus out on the very spot it picked us up. Maybe it will give us the old\r\nchuckeroo a million miles the other side of Pluto. Maybe it will crack\r\nus up on an asteroid or satellite. No way of telling till it happens.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the controls?\"\r\n\r\n\"As useless,\" said Sparks, \"as a cow in a cyclone.\"\r\n\r\n\"So?\"\r\n\r\n\"We sit tight,\" said Sparks succinctly, \"and hope.\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm nodded quietly. He took off his spectacles, breathed on them,\r\nwiped them, replaced them. He was tall and fair; in his neat, crisply\r\npressed business suit he appeared even slimmer than he was. But there\r\nwas no nervousness in his movements. He moved measuredly. \"Well,\" he\r\nsaid, \"that appears to be that. I'm going up to the dining dome.\"\r\n\r\nSparks stared at him querulously.\r\n\r\n\"You're a queer duck, Malcolm. I don't think you've got a nerve in your\r\nbody.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nerves are a luxury I can't afford,\" replied Greg. \"If anything\r\nhappens--and if there's time to do so--let me know.\" He paused at the\r\ndoor. \"Good luck,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Clear ether!\" said Sparks mechanically. He stared after the other man\r\nwonderingly for a long moment, then went back to his control banks,\r\nshaking his head and muttering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGregory Malcolm climbed down the Jacob's-ladder and strode briskly\r\nthrough the labyrinthine corridors that were the entrails of the\r\nspace yacht _Carefree_. He paused once to peer through a _perilens_\r\nset into the ship's port plates. It was a weird sight that met his\r\ngaze. Not space, ebony-black and bejewelled with a myriad flaming\r\nsplotches of color; not the old, familiar constellations treading\r\ntheir ever-lasting, inexorable paths about the perimeter of Sol's\r\ntiny universe, but a shimmering webwork of light, so tortured-violet\r\nthat the eyes ached to look upon it. This was the mad typhoon of\r\nspace-atmospherics through which the _Carefree_ was now being twisted,\r\ntopsy-turvy, toward a nameless goal.\r\n\r\nHe moved on, approaching at last the quartzite-paned observation\r\nrotunda which was the dining dome of the ship.\r\n\r\nHis footsteps slowed as he composed himself to face those within. As\r\nhe hesitated in the dimly-lighted passage, a trick of lights on glass\r\nmirrored to him the room beyond. He could see the others while they\r\nwere as yet unaware of his presence. Their voices reached him clearly.\r\n\r\nJ. Foster Andrews, his employer and the employer of the ten thousand\r\nor more men and women who worked for Galactic Metals Corporation,\r\ndominated the head of the table. He was a plump, impatient little\r\nNapoleon. Opposite him, calm, graceful, serene, tastefully garbed and\r\nelaborately coiffured even here in deep space, three weeks from the\r\nnearest beauty shop, sat his wife, Enid.\r\n\r\nOn Andrews' right sat his sister, Maud. Not young, features plain as a\r\nmud fence, but charming despite her age and homeliness simply because\r\nof her eyes; puckish, shrewdly intelligent eyes, constantly aglint with\r\nsuppressed humor at--guessed Greg--the amusing foibles and frailties of\r\nthose about her.\r\n\r\nShe gave her breakfast the enthusiastic attention of one too old and\r\nshapeless to be concerned with such folderol as calories and dietetics,\r\npausing only from time to time to share smidgeons of food with a\r\nwatery-eyed scrap of white, curly fluff beside her chair. Her pet\r\npoodle, whom she called by the opprobrious title of \"Cuddles.\"\r\n\r\nOn J. Foster's left sat his daughter, Crystal. She it was who caused\r\nGregory Malcolm's staid, respectable heart to give a little lurch as\r\nhe glimpsed her reflected vision--all gold and crimson and cream--in\r\nthe glistening walls. If Crystal was her name, so, too, was crystal her\r\nloveliness.\r\n\r\nBut--Greg shook his head--but she was not for him. She was already\r\npledged to the young man seated beside her. Ralph Breadon. He turned\r\nto murmur something to her as Greg watched; Greg saw and admired and\r\ndisliked his rangy height, his sturdy, well-knit strength, the rich\r\nbrownness of his skin, his hair, his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe sound of his own name startled Greg.\r\n\r\n\"Malcolm!\" called the man at the head of the table. \"Malcolm! Now where\r\nin blazes is he, anyhow?\" he demanded of no one in particular, everyone\r\nin general. He spooned a dab of liquid gold from a Limoges preserve\r\njar, tongued it suspiciously, frowned. \"Bitter!\" he complained.\r\n\r\n\"It's the very _best_ Martian honey,\" said his wife.\r\n\r\n\"Drylands clover,\" added Crystal.\r\n\r\n\"It's still bitter,\" said J. Foster petulantly.\r\n\r\nHis sister sniffed. \"Nonsense! It's delightful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say it's bitter,\" repeated Andrews sulkily. And lifted his voice\r\nagain. \"_Malcolm!_ Where _are_ you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You called me, sir?\" said Malcolm, moving into the room. He nodded\r\npolitely to the others. \"Good morning, Mrs. Andrews ... Miss\r\nAndrews ... Mr. Breadon....\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sit down!\" snapped J. Foster. \"Sit down here and stop bobbing your\r\nhead like a teetotum! Had your breakfast? The honey's no good; it's\r\nbitter.\" He glared at his sister challengingly. \"Where have you been,\r\nanyway? What kind of secretary are you? Have you been up to the radio\r\nturret? How's the market today? Is Galactic up or down?\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm said, \"I don't know, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine! Fine!\" Andrews rattled on automatically before the words\r\nregistered. Then he started, his face turning red. \"Eh? What's that?\r\nDon't know! What do you mean, you don't know? I pay you to--\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no transmission, sir,\" said Greg quietly.\r\n\r\n\"No trans--nonsense! Of course there's transmission! I put a million\r\ncredits into this ship. Finest space-yacht ever built. Latest equipment\r\nthroughout. Sparks is drunk, that's what you mean! Well, you hop right\r\nup there and--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMaud Andrews put down her fork with a clatter. \"Oh, for goodness sakes,\r\nJonathan, shut up and give the boy time to explain! He's standing\r\nthere with his mouth gaping like a rain-spout, trying to get a word in\r\nedgewise! What's the trouble, Gregory?\" She turned to Greg, as Jonathan\r\nFoster Andrews wheezed into startled silence. \"_That?_\"\r\n\r\nShe glanced at the quartzite dome, beyond which the veil of iridescence\r\nwove and cross-wove and shimmered like a pallid aurora.\r\n\r\nGreg nodded. \"Yes, Miss Andrews.\"\r\n\r\nEnid Andrews spoke languidly from the other end of the table.\r\n\r\n\"But what is it, Gregory? A local phenomenon?\"\r\n\r\n\"You might call it that,\" said Greg, selecting his words cautiously.\r\n\"It's an ionized field into which we've blasted. It--it--shouldn't stay\r\nwith us long. But while it persists, our radio will be blanketed out.\"\r\n\r\nBreadon's chestnut head came up suddenly, sharply.\r\n\r\n\"Ionization! That means atmosphere!\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And an atmosphere means a body in space somewhere near--\" Breadon\r\nstopped, bit his lip before the appeal in Malcolm's eyes, tried to pass\r\nit off easily. \"Oh, well--a change of scenery, what?\"\r\n\r\nBut the moment of alarm in his voice had not passed unnoticed. Crystal\r\nAndrews spoke for all of them, her voice preternaturally quiet.\r\n\r\n\"You're hiding something, Malcolm. What is it? Is there--danger?\"\r\n\r\nBut Greg didn't have to answer that question. From the doorway a harsh,\r\ndefiantly strident voice answered for him. The voice of Bert Andrews,\r\nCrystal's older brother.\r\n\r\n\"Danger? You're damn right there's danger! What's the matter with\r\nyou folks--are you all deaf, dumb and blind? We've been caught in a\r\nspace-vortex for hours. Now we're in the H-layer of a planet we can't\r\neven see--and in fifteen minutes or fifteen seconds we may all be\r\nsmashed as flat as pancakes!\"\r\n\r\nThe proclamation brought them out of their chairs. Greg's heart sank;\r\nhis vain plea, \"Mr. Andrews--\" was lost in the medley of Crystal's\r\nsudden gasp, Enid Andrews' short, choking scream, J. Foster's bellowing\r\nroar at his only son.\r\n\r\n\"Bert--you're drunk!\"\r\n\r\nBert weaved precariously from the doorway, laughed in his father's face.\r\n\r\n\"Sure I'm drunk! Why not? If you're smart you'll get drunk, too. The\r\nwhole damn lot of you!\" He flicked a derisive hand toward Greg. \"You\r\ntoo, Boy Scout! What were you trying to do--hide the bad news from\r\nthem? Well, it's no use. Everybody might as well know the worst. We're\r\ngone gooses ... geeses ... aw, what the hell! Dead ducks!\" He fell\r\ninto a chair, sprawled there laughing mirthlessly with fear riding the\r\ntoo-high notes of his laughter.\r\n\r\nJ. Foster turned to his secretary slowly. His ire had faded; there was\r\nonly deep concern in his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Is he telling the truth, Malcolm?\"\r\n\r\nGreg said soberly, \"Partly, sir. He's overstating the danger--but\r\nthere is danger. We are caught in a space-vortex, and as Mr.\r\nBreadon realized, the presence of these ionics means we're in the\r\nHeaviside-layer of some heavenly body. But we may not crack up.\"\r\n\r\nMaud Andrews glanced at him shrewdly.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything we can do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a thing. The officers on the bridge are doing everything possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the older woman, \"we might as well finish our\r\nbreakfast. Here, Cuddles! Come to momsy!\" She sat down again. Greg\r\nlooked at her admiringly. Ralph Breadon stroked his brown jaw. He said,\r\n\"The life-skiffs?\"\r\n\r\n\"A last resort,\" said Greg. \"Sparks promised he'd let me know if it\r\nwere necessary. We'll hope it's not--\"\r\n\r\nBut it was a vain hope, vainly spoken in the last, vain moment. For\r\neven as he phrased the hopeful words, came the sound of swift, racing\r\nfootsteps up the corridor. Into the dining dome burst Hannigan, eyes\r\nhot with excitement. And his cry dispelled Greg's final hopes for\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody--the Number Four life-skiff--_quick_! We've been caught in a\r\ngrav-drag and we're going to crash!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nThose next hectic moments were never afterward very clear in Greg\r\nMalcolm's memory. He had a confused recollection of hearing Sparks'\r\nwarning punctuated by a loud, shrill scream which he vaguely identified\r\nas emanating from Mrs. Andrews' throat ... he was conscious of feeling,\r\nsuddenly, beneath his feet the sickening, quickening lurch of a ship\r\nout of control, gripped by gravitational forces beyond its power to\r\nallay ... he recalled his own voice dinning in his ears as, incredibly,\r\nwith Sparks, he took command of the hasty flight from the dining dome\r\ndown the corridor to the aft ramp, up the ramp, across girdered beams\r\nin the super-structure to the small, independently motored rocket-skiff\r\ncradled there.\r\n\r\nHe was aware, too, of strangely disconnected incidents happening around\r\nhim, he being a part of them but seeming to be only a disinterested\r\nspectator to their strangeness. Of his forcing Maud Andrews toward\r\nthe door of the dome ... of her pushing back against him with all the\r\nweight of her body ... of her irate voice, \"Cuddles! I forgot him!\"\r\nThen the shrill excited yapping of the poodle cradled against her as\r\nthey charged on down the corridor.\r\n\r\nJ. Foster waddling beside him, tugging at his arm, panting, \"The\r\nofficers?\" and his own unfelt assurance. \"They can take care of\r\nthemselves. It's a general 'bandon ship.\" Enid Andrews stumbling over\r\nthe hem of a filmy peignoir ... himself bending to lift her boldly and\r\nbodily, sweating palms feeling the warm animal heat of her excited\r\nbody hot beneath them ... Crystal Andrews stopping suddenly, crying,\r\n\"'Tina!\" ... and Hannigan's reply, \"Your maid? I woke her. She's in the\r\nlife-skiff.\" Bert Andrews stopping suddenly, being sick in the middle\r\nof the corridor, his drunkenness losing itself in the thick, sure\r\nnausea of the ever-increasing unsteadiness beneath their feet.\r\n\r\nThen the life-skiff, the clang of metal as Hannigan slammed the\r\nport behind the last of them, the fumbling for a lock-stud, the\r\nquick, grateful pant of the miniature hypos, and a weird feeling of\r\nweightlessness, rushingness, hurtlingness as his eardrums throbbed and\r\nhis mouth tasted brassy and bloody with the fierce velocity of their\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nSense and meaning returned only when all this ended. As one waking from\r\na nightmare dream, Greg Malcolm returned to a world he could recognize.\r\nA tiny world, encased within the walls of a forty-foot life-skiff. A\r\nworld peopled too scantily. Andrews, his wife and sister, his son and\r\ndaughter; 'Tina Laney, the maid; Breadon, Hannigan, young Tommy O'Doul,\r\nthe cabin-boy (though where he had come from, or when, Greg did not\r\nknow). And himself. In a life-skiff. In space.\r\n\r\nSomewhere in space. He looked through the _perilens_. What he saw then\r\nhe might better never have seen. For that shimmering pink-ochre veil\r\nhad wisped away, now, and in the clean, cold, bitter-clear light of a\r\ndistant sun he watched the death-dive of the yacht _Carefree_.\r\n\r\nLike a vast silver top, spinning heedlessly, wildly, it streaked toward\r\na mottled gray and green, brown and dun, hard and crushing-brutal\r\nterrain below. Still at its helm stood someone, for even in that last\r\ndreadful moment burst from its nose-jets a ruddy mushroom of flame that\r\ntried to, but could not, brake the dizzy fall.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Greg's eyes, stingingly blinded and wet, thought they\r\nglimpsed a wee black mote dancing from the bowels of the _Carefree_; a\r\nmote that might be another skiff like their own. But he could not be\r\nsure, and then the _Carefree_ was accelerating with such violence and\r\nspeed that the eye could see it only as a flaming silver lance against\r\nthe ugly earth-carcase beneath, and then it struck and a carmine bud of\r\nflame burst and flowered for an instant, and that was all....\r\n\r\nAnd Greg Malcolm turned from the _perilens_, shaken.\r\n\r\nHannigan said, \"It's over?\" and Greg nodded.\r\n\r\nHannigan said, \"The other skiffs? Did they break free, or were they\r\ncaught?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I couldn't see for sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must have seen. Are we the only ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't see for sure. Maybe. Maybe not.\"\r\n\r\nThen a body scrambled forward, pressing through the tightness of other\r\nhuddled bodies, and there was a hand upon his elbow. \"I'll take over\r\nnow, Malcolm.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Ralph Breadon. Gregory looked at him slowly, uncomprehendingly\r\nat first. His hand was reluctant to leave the guiding-gear of the\r\nsmall ship which was, now, all that remained to them of civilization\r\nand civilization's wondrous accomplishments. He had not realized until\r\nthis moment that for a while ... for a short, eager, pulse-quickening\r\nwhile ... on his alertness, in his hands, had depended the destinies\r\nof ten men and women. But he knew, suddenly and completely, that it\r\nwas for this single moment his whole lifetime had waited. It was for\r\nthis brief moment of command that some intuition, some instinct greater\r\nthan knowledge, had prepared him. This was why he, an Earthlubber, had\r\nstudied astrogation, made a hobby of the empire of the stars. That he\r\nmight be fitted to command when all others failed. And now--\r\n\r\nAnd now the moment was past, and he was once again Gregory Malcolm,\r\nmild, lean, pale, bespectacled secretary to J. Foster Andrews. And the\r\nman at his side was Ralph Breadon, socialite and gentleman sportsman,\r\ntrained pilot. And in Malcolm the habit of obedience was strong....\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir,\" he said. And he turned over the controls.\r\n\r\nWhat happened then was unfortunate. It might just as well have happened\r\nto Malcolm, though afterward no one could ever say with certainty.\r\nHowever that was, either by carelessness or malfortune or inefficiency,\r\nonce-thwarted disaster struck again at the little party on the\r\nlife-skiff. At the instant Breadon's hand seized the controls the skiff\r\njerked suddenly as though struck with a ponderous fist, its throbbing\r\nmotors choked and snarled in a high, rising crescendo of torment that\r\nlost itself in supersonic heights, and the ship that had been drifting\r\neasily and under control to the planet beneath now dipped viciously.\r\n\r\nThe misfortune was that too many huddled in the tiny space understood\r\nthe operation of the life-skiff, and what must be done instantly. And\r\nthat neither pilot was as yet in control of the ship. Breadon's hand\r\nleaped for the Dixie rod, so, too, did Malcolm's--and across both their\r\nbodies came the arm of Sparks Hannigan, searching the controls.\r\n\r\nIn the scramble someone's sleeve brushed the banks of control-keys. The\r\nmotors, killed, soughed into silence. The ship rocked into a spin. Greg\r\ncried out, his voice a strange harshness in his ears; Breadon cursed;\r\none of the women bleated fearfully.\r\n\r\nThen Breadon, still cursing, fought all hands from the controls but his\r\nown. And the man was not without courage. For all could see plainly,\r\nin the illumined _perilens_, how near to swift death that moment of\r\nuncertainty had led them. The skiff, which an instant before had been\r\nhigh in the stratosphere of this unknown planet ... or satellite\r\nor whatever it might be ... was now flashing toward hard ground at\r\nlightning speed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnly a miracle, Greg knew, could save them now. An impulse spun his\r\nhead, he looked at Crystal Andrews. There was no fear in her eyes. Just\r\na hotness and an inexplicable anger. Beside her was the other girl, the\r\nmaid, 'Tina; she was frankly afraid. Her teeth were clenched in her\r\nnether lip, and her eyes were wide and anxious, but she did not cry out.\r\n\r\nOnly a miracle could save them now. But Breadon's hands performed\r\nthat miracle; his quick, nerveless, trained hands. A stud here ...\r\na lever there ... a swift wrenching toss of the shoulders. His face\r\ntwisted back over his shoulder, and his straining lips pulled taut\r\nand bloodless away from his teeth. \"Hold tight, folks! We're going to\r\nbounce--\"\r\n\r\nThen they struck!\r\n\r\nBut they struck glancingly, as Breadon had hoped, and planned for,\r\nand gambled on. They struck and bounced. The frail craft shivered\r\nand groaned in metal agony, jarred across harsh soil, bounced again,\r\nsettled, nosed over and rocked to a standstill. Somewhere forward\r\nsomething snapped with a shrill, high _ping!_ of stress; somewhere aft\r\nwas the metallic flap-clanging of broken gear trailing behind them. But\r\nthey were safe.\r\n\r\nBreath, held so long that he could not remember its inhalation, escaped\r\nGreg's lungs in a long sigh. \"Nice work, Mr. Breadon!\" he cried. \"Oh,\r\nnice work!\"\r\n\r\nBut surprisingly, savagely, Breadon turned on him.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been _better_ work, Malcolm, if you'd kept your damned\r\nhands off the controls! Now see what you've done? Smashed up our skiff!\r\nOur only--\"\r\n\r\n\"He didn't do it!\" piped the shrill voice of Tommy O'Doul. \"You done it\r\nyourself, Mr. Breadon. Your sleeve. It caught the switch.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quiet!\" Breadon, cheeks flushed, reached out smartly, stilled\r\nthe youngster's defense with a swift, ungentle slap. \"And you,\r\nMalcolm--after this, do as you're told, and don't try to assume\r\nresponsibilities too great for you. All right, everybody. Let's get out\r\nand see how bad the damage is.\"\r\n\r\nInstinctively Greg had surged a half step forward as Breadon silenced\r\nthe cabin boy. Now old habit and common-sense halted him. He's\r\noverwrought, he reasoned. We're all excited and on edge. We've been to\r\nBedlam. Our nerves are shot. In a little while we'll all be back to\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nHe said quietly, \"Very well, Mr. Breadon.\" And he climbed from the\r\nbroken skiff.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHannigan said, \"Looks bad, don't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said Malcolm. He fingered a shard of loose metal flapping like\r\na fin from the stern of the skiff. \"Not hopeless, though. There should\r\nbe an acetylene torch in the tool locker. With that--\"\r\n\r\n\"You ought to of poked him,\" said Hannigan.\r\n\r\n\"What? Oh, you mean--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. The kid was right, you know. He done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"His sleeve, you mean. Well, it was an accident,\" said Greg. \"It could\r\nhave happened to anyone. And he made a good landing. Considering\r\neverything. Anyhow--\" Again he was Gregory Malcolm, serious-faced,\r\nefficient secretary. \"Anyhow, we have been thrust into an extremely\r\nprecarious circumstance. It would be silly to take umbrage at a man's\r\nnervous anger. We must have no quarreling, no bickering--\"\r\n\r\n\"Umbrage!\" snorted Sparks. \"Bickering! They're big words. I ain't sure\r\nI know what they mean. I ain't exactly sure they mean _anything_.\" He\r\nglanced at Greg oddly. \"You're a queer jasper, Malcolm. Back there\r\non the ship, I figured you for a sort of a stuffed-shirt. Yes-man to\r\nthe boss. And then in the show-down, you come through like a movie\r\nhero--for a little while. Then you let that Breadon guy give you the\r\nspur without a squawk--\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm adjusted his plasta-rimmed spectacles. He said, almost\r\nstubbornly, \"Our situation is grave. There must be no bickering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bickering your Aunt Jenny! What do you call that?\"\r\n\r\nSparks jerked a contemptuous thumb toward the group from which they\r\nwere separated. Upon disembarking, only Greg and Sparks had moved to\r\nmake a careful examination of their damaged craft. The others, more\r\nor less under the direction of Breadon, were making gestures toward\r\nremoving certain necessaries from the skiff. Their efforts, slight and\r\nuncertain as they were, had already embroiled them in argument.\r\n\r\nThe gist of their argument, so far as Greg Malcolm could determine, was\r\nthat everyone wanted \"something\" to be done, but no two could agree as\r\nto just what that something was, and no one seemed to have any bursting\r\ndesire to participate in actual physical labor.\r\n\r\nJ. Foster Andrews, all traces of his former panic and confusion fled,\r\nwas planted firmly, Napoleonically, some few yards from the open port\r\nof the life-skiff, barking impatient orders at little Tommy O'Doul\r\nwho--as Greg watched--stumbled from the port bearing a huge armload of\r\nedibles.\r\n\r\n'Tina, the maid, was in a frenzy of motion, trying to administer to the\r\ncomplaints and demands of Mrs. Andrews (whose immaculate hair-do had\r\nsuffered in the frenetic minutes of their flight) and Crystal Andrews\r\n(who knew perfectly well there were sweaters in the life-skiff) and\r\nMiss Maud (who wanted a can of prepared dog-food and a can-opener\r\nimmediately, and look at poor Cuddles, momsy's 'ittle pet was _so_\r\nhungry)!\r\n\r\nBert Andrews was sulkily insisting that it was nonsense to leave the\r\nwarmth and security of the skiff anyway, and he wished he had a drink,\r\nwhile the harassed, self-appointed commander of the refugee corps was\r\nshouting at whomever happened, at any given moment, to capture his\r\ndivided and completely frantic attention. His orders were masterpieces\r\nof confusion, developing around one premise that the castaway crew\r\nshould immediately set up a camp. Where, how, or with what nonexistent\r\nequipment, Breadon did not venture to say.\r\n\r\n\"You see what I mean?\" demanded Sparks disgustedly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreg Malcolm saw. He also saw other things. That their landing-spot,\r\nwhile excellent for its purpose, was not by any manner of means an\r\nideal campsite. It was a small, flat basin of sandy soil, rimmed by\r\nshallow mountains. His gaze sought these hills, looked approvingly on\r\ntheir greenness, upon the multitude of dark pock-marks dotting them.\r\nThese caves, were they not the habitations of potential enemies, might\r\nwell become the sanctuaries of spacewrecked men.\r\n\r\nHe saw, also, a thin ribbon of silver sheering the face of the northern\r\nhills. His gaze, rising still skyward, saw other things--\r\n\r\nHe nodded. He knew, now, where they were. Or approximately. There was\r\nbut one planet in the solar system which boasted such a phenomenon. The\r\napparent distance of the Sun, judged by its diminished disc, argued\r\nhis judgment to be correct. The fact that they had surged through an\r\natmospheric belt for some length of time before finally meeting with\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\n\"Titan,\" he said. \"Hyperion possibly. But probably Titan.\"\r\n\r\nSparks' gaze, following Greg's upward, contracted in an expression of\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n\"Dirty cow! You mean that's where we are?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe so. There's Saturn, our mother planet, looming above us as\r\nlarge as a dinner plate. And the grav-drag here is almost Earth norm.\r\nTitan has a 3,000 mile diameter. That, combined with the Saturnian\r\ntractile constant, would give us a strong pull.\"\r\n\r\nSparks wailed, \"But Titan! Great morning, Malcolm, nobody ever comes\r\nto Titan! There ain't no mines here, no colonies, no--\" He stopped\r\nsuddenly, his eyes widening yet farther. \"And, hey--this place is\r\n_dangerous_! There are--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" said Greg swiftly, quietly. \"Shut up, Sparks. No use\r\ntelling the others. If they don't guess it themselves, what they don't\r\nknow won't alarm them. We've got to do something, though. Get ourselves\r\norganized into a defensive community. That's the only way--\"\r\n\r\nRalph Breadon's sharp, dictatorial voice interrupted him. \"Well,\r\nMalcolm, stop soldiering and make yourself useful!\"\r\n\r\nAnd J. Foster, not to have his authority usurped, supplemented the\r\norder. \"Yes, Malcolm, let's get going! No time for day-dreaming, my\r\nman. We want action!\"\r\n\r\nSparks said, \"Maybe you'll get it now, fatty!\" under his breath, and\r\nlooked at Malcolm hopefully. But his companion merely nodded, moved\r\nforward toward the others, quietly obedient to the command.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHannigan groaned and followed him.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nBreadon said, \"All right, Tommy, dump them here. I have a few words to\r\nsay.\" He glanced about him pompously. \"Now, folks, naturally we want\r\nto get away from here as soon as possible. Therefore I delegate you,\r\nSparks, to immediately get a message off. An SOS to the nearest space\r\ncruiser.\"\r\n\r\nHannigan grinned. It was not a pleasant grin. He took his time\r\nanswering. He spat thoughtfully on the ground before him, lifted his\r\nhead. He said, \"A message, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I said.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what'll I send it with?\" drawled Sparks. \"Tom-toms?\"\r\n\r\nBreadon flushed darkly.\r\n\r\n\"I believe the life-skiff was equipped with a radio? And theoretically\r\nyou are a radio operator?\"\r\n\r\n\"Finest radio money can buy!\" interpolated J. Foster Andrews proudly.\r\n\"Put a million credits into the _Carefree_. Best equipment throughout.\"\r\n\r\nSparks looked from one to another of them, grinned insolently. \"You're\r\nboth right. I _am_ a radio operator, and there _was_ a radio. But we\r\ncrashed, remember? On account of some dope's sleeve got caught in the\r\nmaster switch--\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do!\" snapped Breadon angrily. He stared at the bandy-legged\r\nlittle redhead. \"You mean the radio was broken?\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't helped none. The tubes was made out of glass, and glass\r\ndon't bounce so good.\"\r\n\r\nGreg Malcolm said thoughtfully, \"Sparks, can't you fix it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mebbe. But not in five minutes. Maybe not in five years. I won't\r\nknow till I get going on it.\"\r\n\r\nBreadon frowned.\r\n\r\n\"I'll handle this, Malcolm,\" he crisped. Again to the radioman, \"Well,\r\nyou get to work on it immediately. And as soon as you get it fixed,\r\nsend out an SOS advising the patrol where we are--\"\r\n\r\n\"Speaking of which,\" insinuated Sparks, \"where are we?\"\r\n\r\nBreadon glared at him wrathfully.\r\n\r\n\"Why--why on one of the satellites of Saturn, of course. Any fool can\r\nsee that!\"\r\n\r\n\"O.Q. But does any fool know which one? Or shall I tell you it's Titan?\r\nAnd when you know that, then what? Titan wasn't named that on account\r\nof it was a pimple. It's a big place. What'll I tell the Patrol? _SOS.\r\nStranded in the middle of we-don't-know-where, somewhere on Titan,\r\nmaybe._ They'll be hunting for us till we've got whiskers down to our\r\nknees.\"\r\n\r\nBreadon's irate look vanished. He looked stricken. He said, \"I--I don't\r\nknow. We have a compass--\"\r\n\r\nOnce again it was Gregory Malcolm who entered into the conversation. He\r\nhad been toying, almost absentmindedly, with a funnel taken from the\r\nskiff's stores. Into this he had poured a small portion of water; his\r\nright forefinger was pressed to the bottom of the tube, closing it. He\r\nsaid, \"I can answer part of that question now. Enough to cut the search\r\nin half, anyway. We're in the northern hemisphere of the satellite.\"\r\n\r\nMaud Andrews looked at him sharply as if noticing him for the first\r\ntime in her life.\r\n\r\n\"How,\" she asked, \"did you know that, Malcolm?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Watch this.\" He released his finger at the base of the\r\nfunnel gently, carefully, taking care not to shake it. The captured\r\nwater swirled and trickled through the opening. Greg said, \"Notice the\r\ndirection in which the water whirlpools? Clockwise. On the northern\r\nhemisphere of any normally revolving heavenly body, water released\r\nfrom a basin, funnel, container of any sort, swirls in that direction.\r\nIn the southern hemisphere it swirls counter-clockwise. Maybe you've\r\nnoticed in bathtubs, or--\"\r\n\r\nBreadon said impatiently, \"Never mind the speeches, Malcolm. A very\r\nclever bit of reasoning--if it's true. Do you think you can figure out\r\nour exact latitude and longitude from that?\"\r\n\r\nGreg met his gaze levelly.\r\n\r\n\"Not from that,\" he said, \"nor from anything else. Perhaps you've\r\nforgotten that latitude and longitude are artificial inventions of\r\nman's, based in one case on an imaginary 'equator,' and in the other on\r\nan arbitrarily appointed 'line,' like Greenwich.\r\n\r\n\"But I believe I can approximate our position and state it in such a\r\nway as to cut to a minimum the time of any search that might be made\r\nfor us. That is, if a space patrol ever comes close enough to get\r\nwithin range of Sparks' radio.\"\r\n\r\n\"When,\" said Sparks, \"and if I get it fixed.\"\r\n\r\n\"When,\" said Malcolm confidently, \"you get it fixed.\"\r\n\r\nBreadon gave in with as good grace as he could muster.\r\n\r\n\"Well, all right,\" he conceded grudgingly. \"We'll let that rest for\r\nnow. Meanwhile, it is apparent that we can't escape Titan--or wherever\r\nwe are--immediately. That being the case, our first task will be to set\r\nup a camp. This is as good a spot as any. We'll stay right here by the\r\nship. We'll use the ship to sleep in at nights--\"\r\n\r\nGreg coughed apologetically. \"Mr. Breadon--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what now? More funnels, Malcolm?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you'll excuse me, sir--I don't believe it wise to make camp here.\r\nNor to use the skiff for sleeping purposes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not, my man?\" That was J. Foster.\r\n\r\n\"The conservation of what little fuel and power, we have, for one\r\nthing,\" said Greg. \"Mr. Breadon's idea of using the skiff to sleep in\r\nwas undoubtedly based on the plan of using the heating units. That\r\nwe must not do. The time may come when we will need the skiff again,\r\nbadly. We must save its fuel and electro-motors.\r\n\r\n\"And as for making camp here beside the ship--\"\r\n\r\nHe hesitated. Crystal Andrews, her voice a trifle edged, as had been\r\nthat of her father, prodded him for reply.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she demanded. \"Go on, Malcolm!\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be safe, Miss. This is an exposed and vulnerable spot.\r\nTitan has--dangerous denizens.\" The words came reluctantly. \"It would\r\nbe much safer to take refuge in the hills. In one of those caves up\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nCrystal gasped, \"Caves! Us--living in a cave! Ridiculous!\" J. Foster\r\nechoed her words vehemently. Breadon laughed curtly; Mrs. Andrews\r\nmade a gesture of repugnance with a slim, pale, exquisitely manicured\r\nhand. Bert Andrews snorted. Of the tycoon's family, only Maud Andrews\r\nshowed any inclination to heed the secretary's suggestion. Her old eyes\r\nglinted shrewdly; her head made the ghost of a pleased nod.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut others more openly approved his plan. The maid, 'Tina, watching\r\nMalcolm with curious attentiveness, nodded and said, \"That is wise.\r\nI have heard tales about Titan and its--its denizens.\" Tommy O'Doul\r\ngrinned delightedly. He said, \"Caves! Boy, caves! Old-time stuff, huh,\r\nGreg?\" And Sparks Hannigan had said, \"That's right, folks! And it's\r\npast noon now. Might as well get going right away so's we can get\r\nsettled before dark. Right, Greg?\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet again there was the counter-play, the balance of Breadon's\r\nwealth, Breadon's name and Breadon's accustomed authority to the calm,\r\nsane logic of the slim young secretary. Breadon's curt laugh changed to\r\nsomething definitely antagonistic; his words sheered the muttering like\r\na keen blade.\r\n\r\n\"Very interesting, Malcolm! But wholly impractical and completely\r\nabsurd. We will remain here. And now--\" He glanced at the high-riding\r\nsun. \"And now I think we should eat before setting up our camp. Tommy,\r\nHannigan--bring the electro-stove from the skiff. 'Tina, prepare lunch.\r\nWe'll pursue a more intelligent discussion of our situation on full\r\nstomachs. Malcolm, bring cases from the skiff. We'll build a rough\r\ntable out here in the open.\"\r\n\r\nHe scowled impatiently, authoritatively about the strangely silent\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nAt that moment Gregory Malcolm realized what he must do. It was not\r\na pleasant realization. Greg Malcolm was an easy-going, a peaceful,\r\na placid man. The secretarial type. Sparks had called him a--what\r\nwas it?--a \"stuffed shirt.\" Never, save in rare moments of dreamful\r\nimagining, had Greg ventured to impress his opinions, his will, upon\r\nthe desires of fellow men.\r\n\r\nBut he, of all those now surrounding him, seemed to understand, fully\r\nand completely, the crisis which now faced their refugee group. And\r\nhe--it was made apparent to him by the pompousness of Foster Andrews,\r\nby the mulish petulance of Bert Andrews, by the aloof hauteur of\r\nCrystal and Mrs. Andrews, by the suicidal \"orders\" just given by Ralph\r\nBreadon--he alone was, in this moment of need, capable of deciding the\r\ndestinies of the Earth-exiles.\r\n\r\nJ. Foster Andrews had the acumen and common-sense to lead them--but\r\nhe had not the requisite knowledge. Breadon had the training, the\r\nspace-experience--but he lacked solid horse-sense, and his decisions\r\nwere too strongly flavored by his own savor of self-importance. Yet\r\nif they, ten humans, were to exist for a week ... a month ... a\r\nyear ... until help reached them, someone must command. And he, Gregory\r\nMalcolm, was the only one capable of taking into his hands the reins of\r\nrulership.\r\n\r\nIt was a knowledge at once heady, intoxicating and frightening.\r\nBut--there it was! It had to be faced. And Greg moved, grimly but\r\nmethodically, to the accomplishment of that which he deemed necessary.\r\nHe halted the radioman with a gesture.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Sparks! Tommy, wait! 'Tina!\" And he faced Breadon\r\nfirmly. \"We are not going to do that, Mr. Breadon,\" he said. \"It would\r\nnot be wise. We are not going to do it.\"\r\n\r\nBreadon's brown features darkened with swift anger.\r\n\r\n\"What? What's this?\"\r\n\r\nAnd J. Foster Andrews waddled forward, puffing irate astonishment.\r\n\"Here, here, Malcolm! What do you mean? This is--hrrumph!--blasted\r\nimpertinence, sir! Insubordination!\"\r\n\r\nMalcolm held his ground, his pale cheeks oddly flushed.\r\n\r\n\"We are not going to do these things,\" he repeated slowly, definitely.\r\n\"Breadon--\" It did not occur to him that unconsciously he had abandoned\r\nthe respectful, formal \"Mr.\" which heretofore he had never ommitted.\r\n\"Breadon, your orders clearly indicate that you have not in any way\r\ngrasped the full implications of our plight.\r\n\r\n\"I have already warned that we should not make needless use of our\r\nlimited fuel and power reserves. Yet you've told Tommy to bring the\r\nelectro-stove. I have hinted that there are dangerous antagonists on\r\nTitan, yet you wish boldly to tempt attack by cooking and eating here\r\non this exposed plain in broad daylight. Common sense should advise you\r\nof the folly of eating what few food stores we hold in reserve, yet you\r\ncalmly command the preparation of a full and wasteful meal.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not make mention of the other, perhaps irrelevant but\r\nnonetheless rankling detail. That never once had Breadon offered\r\nto help in these doings, nor had any member of the Andrews clan\r\nvolunteered to assist; that the physical labor had arbitrarily been\r\nassigned to those of lesser caste--himself, Hannigan, young Tommy,\r\n'Tina.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" he continued doggedly, \"I, for one, am refusing to obey\r\nyour orders. I do so because I must. Call it 'insubordination' if you\r\nwish, Andrews--\" The older man spluttered incoherently, mauve-jowled.\r\n\"--but I would call it the 'will-to-exist.' The law of survival. I mean\r\nto survive on this unknown, hostile planet. That can't be done if we\r\nsquander resources as Breadon apparently means to.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA moment of tight silence answered his outburst. A slow, awkward\r\nmovement stirred through the little group. It was, Greg sensed, a\r\nmovement of alignment. He could sense, rather than see, the unconscious\r\ncoalition of his sympathizers behind him; could see, without sensing,\r\nthe outraged drawing-together of the Andrews husband and wife, _fille_\r\nand _fils_, beside Breadon. One there was whose bright, intent eyes\r\nwere clouded with uncertainty. Maud Andrews. Then, as if irresistibly\r\ndrawn by the bonds of blood, she too looked to Breadon as her spokesman.\r\n\r\nBreadon's voice was a thick flame of wrath.\r\n\r\n\"So that's the way it is, eh, Malcolm! Well, this had to come sooner or\r\nlater. Might as well have it over with right now. Get the glasses off,\r\nmy pale young friend! One leader is all we'll have around here!\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward, bigger, browner, heavier than Malcolm. There was\r\na rustle behind Greg; Sparks had stepped to his side, was pressing\r\nsomething into his hand.\r\n\r\n\"This'll make him behave, Greg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Put it away!\" said Greg coldly. \"We'll have better use for\r\nfirearms later on. I'll handle this the way Breadon wants.\" Slowly,\r\npainstakingly, he removed his plasta-rimmed glasses, slipped them\r\nin a lucite case, slid the case into a pocket, removed his trimly\r\ncut double-breasted business coat, handed it to the grumbling little\r\nredhead.\r\n\r\n\"But look--\" growled Sparks. Then stopped. There was a newness about\r\nGreg Malcolm that stopped him. With the goggles removed, he thought\r\ndimly, Malcolm's eyes looked different. Less soft and meeky-mosey. They\r\nwere like--sort of like chunks of grey flint. And Greg wasn't as skinny\r\nas he had looked, now that you saw him with his coat off. He was lean,\r\nyes--but there was a greyhound whippiness to his leanness; a tight,\r\nspring-coiled sort of strength.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Greg. \"You're ready, Breadon?\"\r\n\r\nBreadon's answer was a sudden, rushing charge. One of the women gasped;\r\nthere came the whipping splat of flesh striking flesh, then all noises\r\nmuted save the sound of two men meeting in face-to-face conflict.\r\nBreadon's left jarred Greg back, his right swung wide and hard to put a\r\nswift end to the dispute--\r\n\r\nBut found no target. For leanly, deftly, with pantherlike swiftness,\r\nGreg was out from under the blow; his own left, probing sharply,\r\nflicked once ... twice ... again into his antagonist's face, jarring\r\nBreadon, shocking, stunning him, halting his bull-like rush and jolting\r\nhim back on his heels.\r\n\r\nMaddened, Breadon whirled, seeking this will-o-the-wisp whose jabbing\r\nlefts stung like salt in an open wound. He growled something that was\r\nnever completed, for knuckles bruised the word against his lips. Blood\r\nsprang, saline and hot in his mouth; the taste of it edged his rage to\r\ninchoate blindness, he flailed out recklessly, forgetful of anything he\r\nhad previously known about fighting.\r\n\r\nAnd that was his undoing. Against his bulky charge, Greg could do\r\nnothing but fight the kind of fleeting defensive battle he had learned\r\nin long hours at the gymnasium. A maddened warrior like this was a\r\ndifferent matter, though; he was a vulnerable fighter.\r\n\r\nCalmly and with infinite assurance, Greg stepped inside Breadon's\r\nswinging arms, beneath his faulty guard. His right hand came up once,\r\nsharply, to Breadon's jaw. The big man spluttered pink spray, lifted\r\nhis arms. Again Greg lashed out with his left, this time to the belly;\r\nBreadon gasped and his mouth remained open, sagging.\r\n\r\nLike the whipping length of a python, Malcolm threw that lean,\r\ndeadly-sure right again--this time squarely to the other man's jaw at\r\nthe spot where jawbone meets the ear. The blow cracked in the dull,\r\nastonished silence like the chunk of a heart-biting axe on timber.\r\nBreadon straightened slowly, numbly, in a meaningless reflex. The fire\r\nwent out of his eyes; their brownness dulled like sun-faded velvet.\r\nThen he fell. As a tall building might fall. Crumpling ... the knees\r\nfolding first, the body sagging, the shoulders, the head helpless and\r\nrolling. In sections. He rolled once and lay still.\r\n\r\nSparks Hannigan said, \"Gawddle-mighty!\" His voice was feeble, awestruck.\r\n\r\nGreg Malcolm's fists, falling to his sides, uncoiled reluctantly. As if\r\nthey had gripped the fiery baton of his anger, the battle-urge slipped\r\nfrom him with their unclenching. He drew a deep breath to steady his\r\nragged breathing, nodded to the wide-eyed 'Tina.\r\n\r\n\"Take care of him,\" he said. \"Water. He'll be all right in a minute.\"\r\nHe faced the others, his manner an odd mixture of apology and\r\naggressiveness. \"Breadon said there could be but one in command,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Let us hope that is definitely settled. For all time. And now I\r\nwill ask all of you to help. Our first step will be to strip the skiff\r\nof the equipment we may need and carry it into the hills. In one of\r\nthose caves we will make our head-quarters.\"\r\n\r\nBut the fight was to have its aftermath. Crystal Andrews it was who\r\nburst from the little knot before him to kneel at her fiancés side,\r\ntaking Breadon's head in her arms, glaring rage and hot defiance at\r\nGreg.\r\n\r\n\"With you?\" she cried. \"With _you_, you--cheap, upstart bully? Not in a\r\nmillion years! Ralph--Ralph, dear, are you all right? Did he hurt you?\"\r\n\r\nShe jerked the water-soaked handkerchief from the maid's hands, pressed\r\nits coolness to Breadon's sand-bruised forehead. Breadon's eyes opened,\r\ndazed at first, then full of awareness, sultry, indignant, incredulous.\r\nHe moved to get on his feet again. Greg stared at him coldly.\r\n\r\n\"Get up if you want to, Breadon. But don't get up fighting!\"\r\n\r\nHannigan chuckled. \"He ain't hurt much. Just his conceit. It's punched\r\nfull of right and left hand wallops.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do, Sparks!\" snapped Greg. He looked at the others,\r\nreplacing his glasses carefully, a vague sorrow in his eyes, defeat\r\nin his voice despite his victory. \"You all feel that way? You still\r\nrefuse--?\"\r\n\r\nCrystal Andrews' cried out, \"Talk! Talk! Will you stop talking and go?\r\nGo to the hills if you want to. Leave us in peace. We don't want you\r\nand don't need you. Go to the hills--and good riddance to you!\"\r\n\r\nThe tiny gimlet of hurt that lay somewhere deep inside of Greg twisted\r\nonce more at her words, snapped, became suddenly cold and bitter. His\r\njaw set. He nodded to Sparks.\r\n\r\n\"Very well. If that's your desire. Sparks, there are four of us, six\r\nof them. Take an inventory of all equipment and supplies in the skiff.\r\nWe will take exactly four-tenths of everything ... fuel, power units,\r\nfood, water ... everything. Get going. I'll help you directly.\"\r\n\r\nSparks said, \"The radio?\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll take that. You're the only one capable of repairing it. We'll\r\nsave them in spite of themselves. If we can.\"\r\n\r\nSparks said, \"Aye, sir! Come on, Tommy. 'Tina.\" He started toward the\r\ncrashed skiff. Greg hesitated, feeling the desire to say something,\r\nto make one final plea, not knowing what to say or how to say it,\r\nrestrained by the yet cold anger etched on his heart by Crystal's\r\nscorn. Then he too turned to help. A strident voice halted him.\r\n\r\n\"Just a moment, young man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Miss Andrews?\"\r\n\r\nMaud Andrews, Cuddles firmly cradled to her ample bosom, left her\r\nbrother's side and marched toward the life-skiff.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Sparks to make that a fifty-fifty division,\" she said. \"There\r\nwill be five of us in the hills.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEnid Andrews bleated faintly. Crystal, still kneeling, stared at her\r\naunt incredulously. J. Foster Andrews vented his indignation in a\r\nsudden, blustering roar. \"Maud! Don't be a blasted idiot! Come back\r\nhere this minute!\"\r\n\r\nMaud Andrews continued to surge inexorably forward.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not,\" she grunted, \"being an idiot! It's you who are, my dear,\r\nfat, dimwitted brother! I'm a selfish, pampered old fool, but I\r\nknow common-sense when I hear it, and I know a man when I see one.\r\nFurthermore, silly as you may think it, I have a ridiculous desire to\r\nkeep on living. I may have to _work_ to do that, and I'm not overly\r\nfond of work, but if Mr. Malcolm will have me--?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just plain 'Malcolm,' Miss Andrews,\" said Greg gravely, gratefully.\r\n\"And I'm happy you see it my way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut! I'm not doing you a favor, Malcolm! I'm just looking out for\r\nmyself, as I always do. Well, Sparks, don't stand there yawping like my\r\nthick-pated brother! What can I do to help?\"\r\n\r\nShe waddled away. Greg glanced hopefully at those still waiting,\r\nimmobile.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you--\" he began, \"Won't the rest of you--\"\r\n\r\nThe eyes that met his were glacial. Bert Andrews, thick-lipped and\r\nbridling, snarled disdain. \"The hell with you, Malcolm! The sooner you\r\nget out of here, the better!\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"We'll let you know where to find us. If you should--should\r\nneed us, just call.\"\r\n\r\n\"We won't need you.\" That was Crystal, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you won't,\" said Greg. \"I sincerely hope you won't....\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nSparks Hannigan came out grinning. He said, \"This one looks like the\r\nbusiness, Greg. Plenty of room. Dry and warm. It's even got a natural\r\nfluevent so's we can have a fireplace inside.\"\r\n\r\nGreg nodded, pleased.\r\n\r\n\"Sounds good. I was beginning to think we'd never find a suitable cave.\r\nThis one's within easy reach of that spring, too; that solves the fresh\r\nwater problem. Well, we might as well get settled. Getting toward\r\nevening.\"\r\n\r\n'Tina glanced at the sky, surprised. \"So soon? I didn't know it had\r\ntaken us so long. It seems as if only a few hours ago it was noon.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was,\" grinned Greg. \"Titan's days are shorter than Earth's. Its\r\ndiameter is only about 3,000 miles. By Earth measurements you'd say\r\nTitan had a sixteen hour day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the 'day,'\" grumbled Sparks, \"ain't none too bright at that. On\r\naccount of we're so far from the Sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't seen the worst of it. Right now we're on the Sun side\r\nof Saturn. We revolve about our primary once every 500-odd hours.\r\nSince Saturn is so large, when we are to the lee of it, it eclipses\r\nus entirely. So for about five days every Titan 'month' we suffer a\r\ncomplete blackout.\r\n\r\n\"And that--\" Greg sobered. \"That is another reason the others should\r\ndig into a good warm cave. It gets plenty cold during that eclipse\r\nperiod. An open camp on an exposed plain--\" He shook his head.\r\n\r\nMaud Andrews said, \"I can't understand why this satellite is habitable\r\nat all. I was under the impression that Saturn is a frozen planet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is. Its surface temperature is approximately 300° below zero,\r\nFahrenheit. But the warmth of its numerous satellites is one of the\r\nastonishing discoveries made by the early space explorers, fifty\r\nor sixty years ago. Scientists have not yet explained the matter\r\nsatisfactorily. Some say the tremendous mass of Saturn, the waves of\r\natmospherics set up by its swirling motion and the 'grindstone' of\r\nits ring, form an electronic barrier-shield for the satellites. Still\r\nothers believe that frigid Saturn acts as a gigantic mirror or solar\r\nreflector for its children.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Greg--\" That was Tommy O'Doul. \"Why ain't there any colonies\r\nhere if the climate's O.Q.? Men live on Venus, where it's hot as\r\nbilly-be-hanged, and on Uranus, which is nothing but a ball of ice, and\r\non a bunch of cold, airless asteroids--\"\r\n\r\n\"Economics, Tommy. The simple, single dictator of mankind's every\r\nventure. Venus has valuable vegetation, Uranus and the asteroids have\r\nimportant metals that can't be duplicated in Earth's laboratories,\r\nthe asteroids have rare ore deposits. There is not--or at least there\r\nhas not as yet been discovered--anything native to Titan that cannot\r\nbe mined or made elsewhere more cheaply, more easily. Some day man's\r\never-expanding frontiers will claim this satellite as a colony, too.\r\nBut now that the entire universe is open to man, the human race can\r\nincrease a millionfold and _still_ allow every soul more _lebensraum_\r\nthan he can possibly use.\"\r\n\r\nSparks Hannigan gazed at him admiringly.\r\n\r\n\"It's stoo-pendous!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Titan? Not any more so than--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not Titan. You. You know everything, don't you? Pal--\" Sparks\r\nshook his head. \"I sure had you figgered wrong. I thought you was a\r\nsoft-soaping dope. So then you got us off the _Carefree_ onto the\r\nskiff, cooled Breadon like a herring, declared yourself _It_ and made\r\nus like it--\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Nonsense! I just happened to--Oh, nonsense! Shall we go\r\ninto our new home?\" But he flushed.\r\n\r\nBy evening--Titan's short, grey shadowed evening, the only logical\r\nunit of duration by which they could live so long as they remained\r\ncaptive here--their new cave home began to take on some semblance of\r\nlived-inness.\r\n\r\nVegetation was abundant on the hillsides. Sparks and Tommy had\r\ngathered heaps of dry faggots while Greg built a crude stone fireplace\r\nunderneath the fluevent Sparks had reported; shortly thereafter the\r\nwomen had a cheerful blaze crackling on the hearth, and mingled with\r\nits grateful warmth was the odor of a savory stew, welcome scent to\r\nthe nostrils of five who had worked long and hard in gathering the\r\nvegetables that had gone into that potage.\r\n\r\n\"Eat nothing,\" Greg had warned, \"dig nothing that does not show signs\r\nof having been eaten, dug or picked by wild animals. Later we can make\r\nchemical analysis of dubious foods to determine their edibility. For\r\nthe present we will depend on the most certain test, the acceptance by\r\nother flesh-and-blood creatures.\"\r\n\r\nHe had also permitted that a single can of bouillon concentrate be used\r\nin the stew. \"For flavoring. There is so little food in reserve that\r\nwe must save it against the cold, dark days when we can't get out to\r\ngather supplies. Later on we'll have fresh meat.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked thoughtfully at Cuddles, sniffing, yapping excitedly by the\r\nfireplace, and Maud Andrews, with a swift, maternal gesture, swept the\r\npoodle into her arms and glared at him belligerently.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no you don't! You'll eat _me_ first!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't thinking of that,\" said Greg indignantly. \"I had something\r\nelse in mind. A poodle, eh? Hmmm!\"\r\n\r\n'Tina and young Tommy came into the cave, arms full of fresh and\r\nfragrant ferns which they dumped beside a wall. Greg, glancing at\r\nthem, could not curb his astonishment at the overwhelmingly sudden\r\nchange that had come over 'Tina. During the _Carefree's_ cruise, during\r\nthe years he had worked for old J. Foster, he had seen the girl a\r\nthousand times--but never, he discovered now, really _seen_ her before!\r\nAlways she had been a dim, dusty figure in the background. A foil for\r\nthe spoiled, immaculate perfection of Enid Andrews, the glittering,\r\nheart-stopping beauty of Crystal.\r\n\r\nNow, viewed as a woman and a comrade, he was aware that she was\r\nlovely herself. Slim as a rush, and yielding-strong as that same wild\r\nwater-flower; dark-eyed; hair as the Martian midnight with live lights\r\nglinting in it, too, as the stars glinted over the Martian deserts;\r\nsoft, white hands, graceful but capable--\r\n\r\nBut here! he thought, what nonsense was this? He had work to do. And\r\nthis was no time for weaving poetic cadences about a girl who was\r\npractically a total stranger!\r\n\r\nNow she laughed, gaily, her very laughter seeming to burst from a heart\r\nhappy with newfound freedom. And she said, \"It was just as you said,\r\nGreg. We found the ferns down by the spring. Did we bring enough of\r\nthem?\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Enough for tonight. They'll make comfortable beds. Later on\r\nSparks and I will build real beds for all of us. Thank goodness there\r\nwas a tool-chest on the skiff. You folks ready to eat?\"\r\n\r\nHannigan lifted his nose from the fireplace.\r\n\r\n\"Ready! _I_ been ready for a half hour, and my stummick's been ready\r\nfor a week!\"\r\n\r\nAnd somehow it didn't seem at all surprising to Greg that Maud\r\nAndrews should be the one who, sleeves rolled up, face flushed with\r\nhearth-heat, warmth and good fellowship, seized the ladle, beat on the\r\nside of the pot vigorously and bawled, in what was far from a wealthy\r\nsocialite's cultured tone, \"Come and get it! Come and get it!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo, somehow, the first day was over ... and the second day, too ...\r\nand a week of Titan's sixteen hour days slid past so quickly that Greg\r\ncould not truly say where they had disappeared.\r\n\r\nDuties, chores, at first chaotic became matters of mere routine as\r\none or another of the little band took them on his own shoulders.\r\nMaud Andrews, who on the second day bluntly and surprisingly startled\r\neveryone with the pronunciamento that henceforth there would be, \"--no\r\nmore of this 'Miss Andrews' stuff; call me 'Aunt Maud'; I'm old enough\r\nto have mothered every last one of you!\", set herself up as cook, thus\r\nfreeing 'Tina to take care of the multitude of other household--or\r\ncave-hold--duties. And an excellent cook she turned out to be,\r\nperforming miracles with the odd, variegated samples of produce brought\r\nto her by the rest of the group.\r\n\r\nHer once-aroused suspicion flared again when Greg casually requested,\r\none day, permission to take Cuddles for a little run in the woods. She\r\nclucked to her pet, turned him over to Greg, but watchfully.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what you have in mind, Greg Malcolm. But if you come back\r\nhere with any sinister looking pieces of meat and no Cuddles--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm hoping to come back,\" confessed Greg, \"with both meat _and_\r\nCuddles. He's a poodle, isn't he? Well, he's always been a lap-dog\r\nto you, but I have an idea maybe his heritage will overcome his\r\nhabits when I get him out into the woods. The poodle, in its earliest\r\nbeginnings, used to be a hunting dog, you know. It was bred and trained\r\nespecially for that purpose. Of course his nose may have been ruined by\r\nbeing pampered, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"My Cuddles,\" exclaimed Aunt Maud, \"a hunting dog!\" She looked\r\nhorrified.\r\n\r\nGreg said slyly, \"I hope so. He wouldn't be the first member of this\r\nparty to prove his true worth beneath a thin veneer of civilization.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Maud's cheeks were red, but it might have been the warmth of the\r\nfire. And maybe the wood-smoke made her eyes shine like that, too. She\r\npushed Greg roughly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, run along!\" she ordered. \"But mind you bring him back unchanged!\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay, Auntie,\" Greg said.\r\n\r\nGreg brought him back, but not unchanged. For the poodle had,\r\namazingly, reverted to type, once set on the trail of wild game. Greg\r\ncarried back to the dinner table two small creatures, one vaguely\r\nresembling a squirrel, one definitely allied to the rabbit family,\r\nplunked them proudly before his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Don't give me credit. It was the pup. He's a humdinger. You should\r\nhave seen him tree that squirrel--or whatever it is! And that\r\nrabbit-thing--he went scrambling halfway down a warren after it! Didn't\r\nyou, Slewfoot?\"\r\n\r\nThe dog yerped happily. Aunt Maud moaned.\r\n\r\n\"Slewfoot! Oh, my gracious! Cuddles, come here to momsy-womsy wight\r\naway! Did nassy-mans call him--\"\r\n\r\nCuddles made no move to obey. Greg whistled, and the dog looked up.\r\n\"Okay, Slewfoot. Go to momma!\" And the dog pranced over to Aunt Maud.\r\nGreg grinned. \"I think he likes his new name better,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSlewfoot yerped again in an ecstasy of approval.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd so, gradually, life became easier and smoother and happier for\r\nthe quintet of cave-dwellers. Beds took the place of piled ferns, the\r\nwoodpile towered toward the cave roof against the days of dark and cold\r\nwhich, according to Greg's computations, might be expected within the\r\nnext week or so, food was varied and plentiful, and a needed food was\r\nsupplied when Tommy O'Doul marched triumphantly home with a bawling kid\r\nin his arms.\r\n\r\nSparks glared at him.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, youngster, what did you tote that home for? We ain't got no room\r\nfor pets. And that thing ain't ripe to be et yet.\"\r\n\r\nTommy said, \"I had to bring it. It was the only way I could make its\r\nmom follow me. See?\"\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough, a few yards away, anxiously eying its captive\r\noffspring, was a mother goat. Or something like a goat, anyway. Sparks\r\ncaught on them. A flying tackle and the camp had corraled its first\r\nhead of livestock. And from then on there was milk.\r\n\r\nAnd there were songs in the evening, and card games and stories and\r\ncompensations for the long, hard tasks of the daytime. Sparks labored\r\non his radio set, though without too much hope. \"Smashed to hell and\r\ngone, Greg. The tubes is the wust part. I could jockey the wires\r\naround. But glass--\"\r\n\r\nGreg looked thoughtful. \"I wonder,\" he said. \"I wonder? Well--do what\r\nyou can with the metallic parts.\"\r\n\r\nSo they waited and worked, and in some dim corner of their minds\r\ncontinued to hope for the release which all in some vague fashion\r\nexpected might come \"some day.\" And their camaraderie was great and\r\nwholesome, but there was a single subject they never mentioned. The\r\nother quintet on the plain below. From their hillside eyrie they\r\ncould see the other camp, but by common consent they made no effort to\r\napproach Breadon's followers. They had offered assistance and it had\r\nbeen refused. They could do nothing more, now, unless--\r\n\r\nThe unless came sooner than they expected. In the still of the night\r\nit came in the dark, multi-mooned Saturnian night, when Greg and his\r\ncomrades were all asleep in their bunks.\r\n\r\nGreg woke with a strained feeling that he could not at first identify.\r\nHe only knew, as a newly awakened sleeper dimly knows, that something\r\nwas amiss.\r\n\r\nThen, as he listened, he heard it again. The sound of a firing rifle.\r\nAnd the thin, muted whisper of a cry from the clearing below. A voice\r\nlifted in dismay.\r\n\r\nWith a start he was on his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Sparks!\"\r\n\r\nHannigan bounced from his blankets like a redheaded ball of rubber. He\r\nwas on his feet, scrubbing his eyes with the backs of his hands, even\r\nbefore he knew he was awake.\r\n\r\n\"Smatta? Whuzzup, Greg? Smatta?\"\r\n\r\n\"Below!\" roared Greg. \"The party in the valley--they're in trouble of\r\nsome kind! Get your gun and come on!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\nThe others were awake now. Young Tommy was aquake with excitement. He\r\nmade a headlong dash for the dry niche wherein were stored the arms of\r\nthe cave-dwellers, came back dragging three rifles, handed one to Greg\r\nand another to Hannigan.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get going, Greg!\" he yelped. \"Golly Moses, what do you think it\r\nis? Animals, maybe? Or people? Gosh, let's get going!\"\r\n\r\nGreg took the spare rifle from him firmly.\r\n\r\n\"_We'll_ go; _you_ stay.\" Then, in swift contrition as the lad's face\r\nfell measurable inches. \"Someone must guard the cave while we're gone,\r\nTommy. 'Tina, build up the fire and put a kettle on. Aunt Maud--\"\r\n\r\nThe old woman nodded grimly.\r\n\r\n\"I know. We'll have hot water ready. And bandages if you need 'em. Run\r\nalong!\"\r\n\r\nHow they ever got down that mountain-side so quickly was ever afterward\r\na mystery to Greg. It was not exactly a painless descent; their\r\nprogress was a series of runs, falls and buttock-bruising slides. The\r\nfooting, in broad daylight, was precarious at best; with only sallow\r\nSaturn and the aura of the Rings to illumine their way, it is a wonder\r\nthey ever reached the plain whole, in a single piece.\r\n\r\nTo add to their frenetic haste, in their ears there rang the constant\r\nchallenge of gunfire. Crimson flashes lit the flatsward below, once a\r\nwhining slug, miserably aimed, made both of them duck instinctively\r\nas it shrilled somewhere over their heads, _spanged!_ against a rock\r\nbehind them, went ricochetting off into the darkness.\r\n\r\nFor now they were on level ground, and mingled with the rattle of arms\r\nthere was another sound, the purling whimper of tongueless, inhuman\r\nthings astir and hungry. Greg had once heard, on Earth, the furtive\r\nnight-passage of a jackal tribe; the soft, half plaintive mewlings, the\r\nincessant scrape of scrabbling paws, the ammoniac stench of unwashed\r\nbodies. He thought of this now, sharply, as he heard these mutterings,\r\nsmelled these rank odors, strained his eyes to determine contours in\r\nthe darkling night.\r\n\r\nHannigan complained, \"You see 'em, Greg? It's dark as a whale's gut. I\r\ncan't see nothing. What'll we fire at? Are our folks out in the open or\r\nin the skiff? We might hit _them_ if--\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"We'll know in a minute.\" As they moved forward he tugged\r\nfrom his belt the weapon he had been holding in reserve; the one such\r\nweapon found amongst the stores of the life-skiff; one he dared use but\r\ninfrequently because once its charge was exhausted he had no way of\r\nreplenishing it. \"We should be near enough now. Spot 'em quick and fire\r\nwhile there's light!\"\r\n\r\nHe jerked the trigger of the Haemholst flame pistol. A writhing\r\nstreamer of ochre speared from its muzzle, lighting the plain with a\r\nhot and eerie effulgence. Like a fiery dart it blazed into the heart of\r\nthe pack surrounding the life-skiff. By its lingering gleam Greg saw,\r\nwith stomach-churning repulsion, the creatures which attacked.\r\n\r\nNeither men nor wolves were they, but a cruel parody on each. Lean,\r\nhair-matted beast-things running on four legs, semi-human of feature\r\nbut with loose lips snarling back from yellow fangs; fingered paws\r\nlong-clawed; indescribably evil and filthy; the more inhuman because\r\nthey embodied so many physical attributes of Man.\r\n\r\nTheir pack must have numbered three score, ranging from gray-pelted old\r\nones to skinny, ragged pups. Apparently they had surprised the plateau\r\nparty in the open, allowing them no time to remove their precious\r\ncampstuffs, because the ground about, around and before the skiff was\r\nlittered with a refuse of clothing, blankets, supplies and equipment,\r\ncases and scraps of food.\r\n\r\nIt was for this last that the wolf-men had attacked, because even as\r\nthe ochre beam found their midst, they were scrambling hungrily about\r\nthe campsite, avidly gobbling all edible scraps they could nose out.\r\nA few more aggressive ones scented richer victuals; these it was who,\r\ndespite the sporadic fire from within the skiff, snuffled, clawed and\r\nclamored at the port.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUntil the heat-beam struck them. That put an end to their hunger and\r\ntheir blood-lust. Like any wild woodland animal, they had no fear\r\nof firearms; they had no experience with them. Bullets that struck,\r\nkilled; wolf-men untouched by bullets had no way of associating hurt\r\nwith a sharp burst of sound and a strange, unfamiliar powder-scent.\r\n\r\nBut light--light that burned the hair and scorched the flesh; light\r\nthat spared not one of them, but spread to dose all with its heatful\r\npain--that was something different! As the beam struck and spread,\r\nsnuffings changed to bestial screams of fear and pain. Those nearest\r\nthe beam's focal point felt no pain; they died instantly, charred\r\nhulks that crisped and sank, shapeless, to the ground. And from these\r\nstrangely altered, swiftly dead companions the others fled, howling\r\nin shrill alarm. Their footsteps were the dry patter of leaves on\r\nshale; they broke and ran wildly for the nether hills, tonguing shrill\r\nululations of hurt.\r\n\r\nThen the door of the skiff opened cautiously; dim light was a sliver, a\r\ncrack, an oblong. And the voice of J. Foster Andrews quavered through\r\nthe darkness to their ears. It sounded shrill and afraid.\r\n\r\n\"Malcolm--is that you?\"\r\n\r\nSparks snorted derisively. \"Ain't that awful?\" he demanded. \"Is that\r\nyou!\" He raised his voice. \"Hell, no, it ain't him! It's the Gray\r\nLensman. Who'd you think?\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Sparks!\" Greg said, \"Hold your fire, the wolf-things are\r\ngone. We're coming in!\"\r\n\r\nA few moments later, he and Hannigan were standing within the\r\nlife-skiff.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGregory Malcolm was twenty-six years old. For more than eight years\r\nhe had been training himself to undergo any and all emotions without\r\nchange of expression. That was, in his opinion, a prime requisite\r\nfor a man whose vocation lay in a subordinate position. Now he was\r\ngrateful for learning that self-control, and hoped his features were as\r\ngranitelike as he tried to make them. He hoped his eyes did not mirror\r\nthe astonishment, the shock, the numb dismay he felt when he first\r\nglanced about the interior of that cabin, and at those who stood before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was incredible that in one short week--one very short Titanian\r\nweek--so great a change could have been wrought in this haughty\r\nquintet. _His_ followers were weathering the storm of catastrophe\r\nwithout faltering, without any relaxation of civilized standards. But\r\nBreadon's--\r\n\r\nHe studied them, his quietude concealing the sudden heartsickness he\r\nknew, his spectacles hiding the swift light of horror in his eyes. The\r\nmen had not shaved, it was clear, since their crash-landing. Five day\r\nstubble lay frostily on the jowls of J. Foster Andrews, blackly on the\r\ncheeks of his son and son-in-law to-be.\r\n\r\nNor did slovenliness end there. Beneath the beard-growth, the skin\r\nof the men looked dirty, dingy, sallow, as if they had not washed\r\nfor days. Their clothes were equally soiled and sorry. Greg saw that\r\nJ. Foster's nails were dull and broken and grubby as the nails of a\r\nstevedore.\r\n\r\nHe rallied himself with an effort. These were men. They had been\r\nworking hard, laboring. They could not stay immaculate. They had been\r\nin a fight.\r\n\r\nThen he looked at the women, and knew that he made excuses vainly. It\r\nwas even more disillusioning to see what had happened to Mrs. Andrews\r\nand Crystal in so short a time.\r\n\r\nEnid Andrews, fashion-plate of two continents, one of Earth's\r\nsmartest-dressed women, thrice-named by fashion authorities as Best\r\nDressed Woman in the Solar Confederation, hobbled sloppily about on\r\nscuffed slippers, the heel of one of which had broken off and not been\r\nreplaced, so that her posture sagged like a bag of meal, split at a\r\nside-seam and sifting awkwardly away. Her once elaborate coiffure was a\r\nbird's-nest of tangled braids which hung unbraided, curls that sagged\r\nlimply; hastily adjusted pins and combs clung insecurely to locks that,\r\nonce pearl-silver, were now clay-crusted gray.\r\n\r\nCrystal--glamorous, pulse-stirring Crystal--was in no better plight.\r\nHer gorgeous ash-gold hair was pulled severely back from a forehead\r\nwhich, Greg discovered, was not nearly so broad and smooth and high\r\nas he had imagined; the artificial color had rubbed from her cheeks,\r\nleaving them lustreless and sullen; her lips--ever rich, ripe,\r\nfull--were pale and harsh-thin and her mouth had tight, argumentative\r\nlines at the corners. Her eyes were dark-rimmed, weary, haggard. She\r\nwas, thought Greg with shocked comprehension, a tired girl.\r\n\r\nThey were all tired. Tired and beaten and dejected. All but Breadon\r\nwho, even now, was eyeing Greg defiantly, as if challenging him to\r\ncomment on their condition. He said, bitterly, \"Thank you, Malcolm. It\r\nwas a most magnanamous gesture, coming down from your hilltop castle to\r\nrescue us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreg said nothing. He was looking about the interior of the cabin,\r\nnoticing with incredulous disfavor the way it had been abused,\r\nlittered, left uncleaned. Ashes, dirty dishes, scraps of cloth and\r\npaper, fragments of cartons and dirt tracked in from outside....\r\n\r\nBut Hannigan was not bound by Greg's compunctions. He spoke his mind\r\nfrankly, staring at the five skiff-dwellers with obvious contempt in\r\nhis eyes.\r\n\r\n\"If you'd ask me,\" he said, \"it's damn near time somebody come down and\r\nrescued you. Not from wolves, neither. From yourselves. You all look\r\nlike you'd been drug through the butt end of a wringer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we have,\" began Bert Andrews savagely. \"We have been through--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, you fool!\" Breadon cut short his plaint viciously; blustered\r\ndefiance that was in itself an apology. \"We've been busy making a camp\r\naround here. We haven't had time to--\"\r\n\r\nSparks drawled, \"Bud, we been busy making a camp, too, in a place which\r\nwasn't already equipped with furnishings, like your'n. And I think we\r\ndone a better job of it. And in between times, we found time to shave\r\nand bathe once in a while.\"\r\n\r\nAndrews flushed and said stiffly, \"There is a need of being provident\r\nwith water. Our supply is limited--\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"What? You mean you've been using the water reserve from the\r\nlife-skiff?\"\r\n\r\nEnid Andrews answered. Excitedly. Volubly. Almost at the point of\r\ntears. She wrung her hands, and Greg could not help noticing the\r\nanomaly of those at once dirty and gem-bedecked fingers.\r\n\r\n\"We have. Oh, we have. There's no other water anywhere around here.\r\nNor food. We've been living on concentrates ... sickening, horrible\r\nstuff....\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not true!\" flamed Breadon. \"We did have other food. I made\r\nbread. I caught small game. I put out traps. There would have been\r\nplenty of food except for the wolf-men who raided tonight. They broke\r\nour stove ... stole my reserves....\"\r\n\r\n\"Which,\" mocked Sparks, \"you conveniently left out for them to sniff\r\nand come a-running after? Why don't you call it a day, Breadon? Admit\r\nyou're nothing but a cocky Earthlubber at heart and--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you little whippersnapper!\" Breadon took a swift step forward.\r\nBut Greg had heard enough. He laid a restraining hand on the\r\nsocialite's arm. His voice was as soothing, as pleading, as he could\r\nmake it.\r\n\r\n\"Haven't we had enough of that already? Look here, Breadon, let's let\r\nbygones be bygones. We've had our little quarrel, now let's act like\r\nsane and sensible humans.\r\n\r\n\"You're not situated here any too well. You've admitted you're not\r\nnear a water supply. The terrain is open to attack, as is proven by\r\ntonight's incident. You've been, well--let's say 'unlucky.'\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand--we've been lucky. We've got a nice, warm cave\r\nlarge enough to house all ten of us easily. We have soft beds and\r\ngood food and fresh milk; safety and good fellowship. With some of\r\nthe things you have in here--those upholstered chairs, for instance;\r\nwhat remains of your equipment and supplies, we could make a veritable\r\nparadise of our cave.\r\n\r\n\"So what do you say? Let's cast in our lots together. Make it one big,\r\nhappy family?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. Foster looked at him thoughtfully. Enid Andrews began to cry softly.\r\nCrystal glanced at Ralph, then at Greg, than at Breadon again. Bert\r\nAndrews stroked his chin. He said, \"It sounds good--\"\r\n\r\nBreadon interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"There's just one thing, Malcolm,\" he said curtly. \"We'll accept\r\nyour--your overtures of friendship on one condition. That you'll\r\nstep down from the high horse you've been riding lately, come to the\r\nrealization that you're not cock-o'-the-walk around these parts.\"\r\n\r\nGreg said gravely, \"If you mean that our community shall be a society\r\nin which all share and share alike, I am in complete agreement with\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I mean,\" said Breadon. \"Of course, we all recognize that\r\nthere must be leadership. As our oldest man, our most important member,\r\nMr. Andrews is that logical leader. I can assure you, acting as his\r\nlieutenant--\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" said Sparks loudly. \"It's the same old thing in a different\r\npackage, Greg. He wants to be boss, else he won't play. The answer\r\nis--comets to you, Breadon. We're doing all right the way we are;\r\nyou're making a mess of your affairs. As far as I'm concerned, you can\r\nstay here and stew in your own gravy!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned toward the door. Greg said, \"Wait, Sparks. I'll be right with\r\nyou.\" And he, too, nodded at Breadon. \"I fear Sparks is right, Breadon.\r\nYou haven't learned your lesson yet. We're going back where we belong.\r\nWe're glad to have been of some small service to you. If you ever need\r\nus again, just call. Meanwhile, my offer remains open. If you should\r\never decide to join us on _our_ terms--\"\r\n\r\nA loud and cheerful voice interrupted him. A voice from outside,\r\nbellowing gay greeting, \"Ahoy, you in there! Open the door!\"\r\n\r\nSparks said, \"Aunt Maud! What's she--?\" and pulled the door open. In\r\nthe oblong, against the slow gray dawn now crawling above the hilltops,\r\nstood Aunt Maud, a huge grin on her face, a tremendous bowl in her\r\nstalwart arms. From the bowl rose a tantalizing aroma. She waddled in,\r\nplunked it on the nearest desk.\r\n\r\n\"Thought you folks might be sort of hungry after a scrap,\" she grinned.\r\n\"Watched it from the cave. Nice, cozy place to watch a fight from. Saw\r\nmorning was coming on, so I brought you down some breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"Sister--\" She glanced at the sallow-cheeked Enid shrewdly. \"You\r\nlook sort of peaked. You too, Crystal. You look older, honey. Well,\r\nGreg--ready? We'd better be running along. 'Tina's got our breakfast\r\nalmost ready. Fruit juice and porridge and pancakes with butter and\r\nsugar-syrup. Sounds good, eh? Well, 'bye, folks!\"\r\n\r\nAnd by main force she herded the two men swiftly out of the skiff.\r\nOutside, moving toward the hill, Sparks turned on her pettishly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, what did you go and do that for, Aunt Maud--you've gummed up\r\neverything! Greg was telling 'em off; just beginning to make 'em listen\r\nto reason--\"\r\n\r\nAunt Maud grinned and winked broadly at Greg.\r\n\r\n\"Sparks, are all radiomen as dumb as you, or do you hold the\r\nchampionship? Greg could talk from now to doomsday and not get anywhere\r\nwith that outfit. I _know_. They're my own haughty, independent,\r\npigheaded flesh and blood.\r\n\r\n\"But that stew I brought them--\" She chuckled and rolled her eyes\r\ndelightedly. \"Now, that's a _real_ argument. The best their bellies\r\never listened to. Just wait and see!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VII\r\n\r\nThe truth of her statement was exhibited very soon. That very\r\nafternoon, in fact. The dim Titanian sun was settling toward the\r\nwestward hilltops, and Greg was just putting the finishing touches to\r\na crude grist-mill he was rigging for the women, when there came the\r\nscrape of hesitant footsteps up the rocky pathway.\r\n\r\nHannigan had been away since breakfast time, making a survey of the\r\nnatural resources within easy distance of their cave. Greg thought it\r\nwas the radioman returning.\r\n\r\n\"Hi!\" he shouted over his shoulder, without looking back. \"Any luck?\r\nWhat did you find?\" Then, as no voluble, profane, fantastic answer\r\nwas forthcoming, he turned around. His eyes momentarily betrayed his\r\nastonishment. \"Oh! Hello, Andrews!\" he said.\r\n\r\nBert Andrews shuffled uncomfortably. His gaze held a curious mixture\r\nof wistfulness, reluctance and expectancy. He said, in a voice that\r\nwas a trifle too breathlessly nonchalant, \"Hello, Malcolm. Just taking\r\na little stroll, so I thought I might drop up and see--see how you're\r\nmaking out.\" He glanced about him, obviously impressed. \"Not so bad,\"\r\nhe said. \"Not bad at all! That's the cave, I suppose? See you have\r\nthings pretty well straightened out. What's that?\"\r\n\r\nGreg's gaze followed his nod to the crosswork which was suspended\r\ndirectly above the cave-mouth; a latticework of steel, firmly\r\nwire-lashed, secured by a rope, the stretch of which dipped into the\r\ncave itself.\r\n\r\n\"Barrier-shield,\" explained Greg. \"Hangs on a pulley. We can drop it\r\nfrom inside. In case of attack, you see. Slides down that groove into\r\nthe channel cut in the ground, holds tight there.\" He grunted. \"That's\r\none of the reasons we don't have any honest-to-John furniture in our\r\nhome. We had too many other important uses for the metal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clever,\" said Andrews. \"Ingenious. I--er--got to thinking over what\r\nyou said this morning, Malcolm, after you left. You were right. For a\r\ngroup of civilized people we let ourselves get into sorry shape.\"\r\n\r\nHe rubbed his chin reflectively. Greg noticed for the first time that\r\nhis face was no longer dark with beard; that though his clothes were\r\nstill dirty, he had made an effort to straighten them, dust them. The\r\nskin of his face, though, was pink and sore; chafed.\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"What in the world did you shave with, Bert? A cross-cut\r\nsaw?\"\r\n\r\nAndrews said defensively, \"The electric razor won't work. The dry-cells\r\nare exhausted, and we can't use D. C. without wasting fuel. There\r\nwasn't a honed blade aboard the skiff. I used my pocket-knife. It--\" he\r\nconfessed ruefully, \"It wasn't very sharp.\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Hannigan mounted carborundum sheets on a lathe wheel and\r\nput edges on a couple steak knives for us. I'll let you have one before\r\nyou go back. Hey, there he is now! What's the story, Sparks?\"\r\n\r\nHannigan came into the clearing at a trot. He was excited. He said,\r\n\"Sweet Christmas cow, Greg, you know what I run across? A--What's this?\r\nCompany?\"\r\n\r\nThe eager, interested look fled from Bert Andrews' eyes. He said\r\nstiffly, \"I--I guess I'll be running along now, Malcolm. See you again.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe turned, his shoulders very stiff. Too stiff to be convincing. Greg\r\nglanced at him appraisingly, motioned the radioman to keep his mouth\r\nshut, called after the young Andrews.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go yet, Bert. We're just getting ready for dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinner?\" The young man spun like a top. Then he recalled his dignity.\r\n\"Oh--dinner! Why, I guess ours is almost ready, too. 'Bye--\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd be glad to have you stay,\" said Greg levelly, striving to keep\r\nthe amusement out of his voice. \"I think there's a roast tonight.\r\nSomething that looks like a young suckling pig, can't exactly tell,\r\nthough, till we taste it. These Titanian animals are different. Then\r\nthere's a salad and potatoes and beans, a fruit compote, and I think\r\n'Tina baked a pie today.\"\r\n\r\nAndrew's eyes widened as his lips twitched. \"I--I wouldn't want to be\r\nany trouble,\" he said faintly.\r\n\r\n\"No trouble at all,\" said Greg. Then, unable longer to restrain\r\nhimself, \"But of course if you think they'll be expecting you--?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I'll stay!\" blurted Andrews hastily. \"Thanks. I can wash up\r\nsomewhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Inside. Ask Aunt Maud for soap. She's the custodian of that.\" Then,\r\nas the young man disappeared into the cave hurriedly, Greg grinned at\r\nHannigan. \"One!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You want to hear about what I seen?\" demanded the redhead. \"Listen, it\r\nwas terrific! Great big marsh, full of the damnedest life-forms and\r\ncraziest vegetation anybody ever met up with. Hot, too! Steamy, like\r\nthe Grand Marshes of Venus, only not quite as stinking--\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, annoyed. \"One what? You ain't listening to a word I'm\r\nsaying. Don't you want to hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Later, Sparks,\" said Greg. \"Right now I'm wondering how long it will\r\ntake the others to fall in line.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt didn't take long. The citadel of stubbornness had been undermined\r\nthe night of the attack, it toppled with Bert Andrews' \"friendly\r\nvisit\"--from which, some time later, he staggered home glassy-eyed with\r\nan overdose of wild roast, hot vegetables, crisp greens and luscious\r\nfruits, succulent berry pie--and it crashed, violently, the next day.\r\n\r\nBert Andrews brought his dad up the hill, presumably to confer with\r\nMalcolm on a future mutual defensive system; the two of them lingered\r\nfor lunch--and after lunch old J. Foster, with the blunt directness\r\nwhich accounted for his success in Earth's business world, sat back,\r\ngrunted comfortably, and said, \"That's the first meal I've enjoyed\r\nsince I was a pup in Service! Malcolm, you win! I'm sick and tired of\r\nthis squabbling, and of our hand-to-mouth existence down there. Is\r\nthere room for me in this cave of yours?\"\r\n\r\nIt was no moment for gloating triumph. Greg said, \"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm moving in. And so is my wife. What do you want me to do?\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Hannigan and I were planning to break ground for a small\r\nfarm this afternoon, but this is more important. We'll go down with you\r\nand help you move up your personal things. How about--\" he hesitated\r\nbriefly \"--how about Crystal? And Breadon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said J. Foster unhappily. \"But if they're smart,\r\nthey'll quit kicking against the pricks, too.\"\r\n\r\nThey were smart. When Andrews and his son, accompanied by Hannigan,\r\nTommy and Greg, appeared at the skiff to move the Andrews' property,\r\nwhen Andrews told them bluntly that he and Enid and Bert were casting\r\ntheir lot in with the cave-dwellers, there was a moment of sultry\r\nsilence, fraught with reluctance, anger, recrimination--then Breadon\r\nbowed to the inevitable. Not with good grace, but with grudging\r\nagreement he said, \"Very well. If that's the way you want it, Mr.\r\nAndrews. If we're welcome up there, Malcolm--?\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"You are welcome, Breadon. I told you that a week ago.\"\r\nAnd promptly forgot Breadon and Breadon's surliness as he realized\r\nthat Crystal, too, had been shamed into a recollection of her feminine\r\nduty to herself. Somewhere she had found cosmetics, and somehow she\r\nhad managed to clean and press out a fawn-colored desert sun-suit.\r\nOnce again, ash-blonde hair combed back to a shoulder-length veil of\r\nshimmering loveliness, pale golden skin fresh and creamy and fragrant\r\nbeneath the sheer silk of her abbreviated costume, she was the\r\nglamorous, crystal-lovely Crystal of more leisured days. A woman at\r\nonce lovely, challenging and--desirable.\r\n\r\nThus the nation divided against itself was united. And thus began the\r\nsecond phase of the refugees' struggle to exist against staggering odds\r\non the lonely, hostile moon of Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 VIII\r\n\r\nAmazingly, the period of readjustment was not long, nor was it arduous.\r\nIt was accomplished briefly, surely, in a series of emphatic object\r\nlessons. There was Enid Andrews, for instance. On her first afternoon\r\nin the cave she called 'Tina to her side, ordered the beautification of\r\nher face, her hair, her nails, and with a sigh of relief surrendered to\r\nthe ministrations of the younger girl.\r\n\r\nGreg, witness to this, frowned. But he motioned for silence when Aunt\r\nMaud would have made some irate comment.\r\n\r\nThat evening, by former agreement, Enid washed the dinner dishes. When\r\n'Tina stepped forward to dry them, Greg stopped her.\r\n\r\n\"Sit down, 'Tina. Mrs. Andrews will dry them.\"\r\n\r\nEnid started, gasped, stared at the huge pile appalled. 'Tina said,\r\n\"But there are so many of them, Greg. Ten of us--\"\r\n\r\n\"You have done extra work today,\" said Greg suavely, \"to earn your\r\nrest. Mrs. Andrews is in your debt. She must work out her obligation.\r\nWe have,\" he continued pointedly, \"no servants or masters here.\r\nCourtesies must be repaid in kind.\"\r\n\r\nOnly twice more did the lessons have to be repeated; once when Bert\r\nAndrews gluttonously devoured an entire berry pie and was made to spend\r\nthe next lunch-hour picking fruit for another; again when Breadon\r\ncarelessly fouled the spring by washing in it, and in penance was\r\nrequired to construct a clay-and-stone dam below the spring, that in\r\nthe future the community might have adequate bathing facilities; after\r\nthat everyone understood that he had his alloted share of work, that\r\nthe work must be done, that meals, warmth, comfort and safety could be\r\nearned only by sweat and toil.\r\n\r\nAnd gradually the rude cave dwelling began to take on the semblance of\r\na home. During the short days at their disposal before Titan, pursuing\r\nits cosmic rounds, plunged into the umbra of its gigantic mother\r\nplanet, every member of the refugee corps worked feverishly to prepare\r\nand fortify for the dark days to come.\r\n\r\nIt was well that they did so, for when the darkness descended, ensued a\r\nbleakness even more terrifying than Greg had anticipated. The eclipse\r\nof Titan by its parent was no mild, momentary phenomenon like the\r\neclipsing of Earth by Luna; it was a five day cessation of all heat and\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nWith the darkness came sweeping, icy winds, gales monstrously violent,\r\nand incredible cold. From a sky black and terrible came the snow, five\r\ninches of it in an hour, eight feet of it in a day. It was alarming at\r\nfirst. Then Greg and all of them realized that the very ferocity of\r\nthe storm was their salvation! Were there to be this frightful cold\r\n_without_ snow, not all the fires of Gehenna, not all the clothing and\r\nblankets in the universe, could have protected them. But the snow,\r\ndropping like a sodden, white blanket, choked and filled the mouth of\r\ntheir cave, piled thicker and thicker, enswaddling them in a fleecy\r\ncomfort that kept out the bone-brittling blasts.\r\n\r\nThen they thanked the foresight that had led them to build up a\r\nroof-touching fuel reserve, a store of fresh produce and game, for they\r\ncould not leave their refuge. They were snowbound until Titan left the\r\nshadow of Saturn and the warmth should again melt their prison walls.\r\n\r\nBut those days were not days of idleness; they were days of\r\naccomplishment. The women, under 'Tina's guidance, ripped apart\r\nunneeded goods salvaged from the skiff's stores--tarpaulins, extra\r\nbedding and napery, carpeting, drapes--and restitched them into more\r\nneeded, more practical articles of wearing and household apparel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBreadon and Greg, laying aside a mutely-acknowledged hostility,\r\npooled their knowledge and ingenuity in an effort to ascertain their\r\nwhereabouts on the satellite. Neither had studied mathematics closely,\r\na fact each now bewailed. But they had a few books on astrogation,\r\ntaken from the skiff, and they had determination and intelligence.\r\nUtilizing some of their precious, dwindling store of forged metal, they\r\nconstructed a crude but--they believed--reasonably accurate sextant\r\nwith which, when the darkness was gone, they hoped to take celestial\r\nreadings that would aid their computations.\r\n\r\nIn the making of this, Greg was forced to sacrifice something that\r\nhad been for almost ten years as much a part of him as his arms and\r\nlegs. His spectacles. Strangely, he did not miss them much after the\r\nfirst day. Their purpose had been mainly to protect him from eyestrain\r\nand headaches in a confined vocation that required much reading. But\r\nhere on Saturn's satellite, health improved by hard labor, Greg had\r\nexperienced no headaches. He was, in fact, almost disgustingly healthy.\r\nHe could tell by the straining of his clothes at throat and chest and\r\nwaist-band that he was gaining weight; his appetite had improved and\r\nwhen night came, he did not have to read himself to sleep.\r\n\r\nYoung Tommy took upon himself the task of chronicling their exile.\r\nHis method, though extravagantly romantic as befitted his years\r\nand enthusiasm for this adventure, was nonetheless efficient. He\r\nlaboriously scraped smooth a wide portion of the cave-wall; on this\r\nhe inscribed a calendar, a log, and a map of such portions of the\r\nsatellite as they had so far explored.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sparks Hannigan fretted over his damaged radio set. An\r\naccomplished bug-pounder, he took little time to get the wiring\r\nrearranged. The replacement of metal parts was a tougher problem, but\r\nit, too, he solved with the aid of their acetylene torch.\r\n\r\nOne final job, however, stopped him cold. He shook his head when he\r\nspoke of it to Malcolm.\r\n\r\n\"The tubes, Greg. It just ain't no use. We can't operate the radio\r\nless'n we got tubes, and ours is gone. I guess I'm just wasting my\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"Isn't there a type of radio that works without tubes?\r\nOperates on a crystal, or something?\"\r\n\r\nSparks said, \"Yeah. But it ain't got no power. We got to get a message\r\nplumb off the satellite, out into space where it can be picked up by a\r\nSpace Patrol cruiser. Or the Saturn lightship.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's impossible? Suppose you had glass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you make it?\" scoffed Sparks.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe,\" said Greg. \"Glass was accidentally discovered in the first\r\nplace, you know, by Phoenician sailors who built a fire on a sandy\r\nbeach wherein was imbedded raw chunks of natron. We might be able to do\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\nSparks shook his head glumly. \"O.Q. So that gives us glass. We still\r\ngot to blow it, and figger out some way of sucking the air out, and\r\nwinding filaments. Oh, understand, I ain't saying we can't _do_ it,\r\nGreg. But it'll take years.\"\r\n\r\nGreg nodded soberly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll overlook no bets. Sparks--tell you what to do. You go\r\nahead and build one of those simple 'crystal' sets, just in the event\r\nthat someday a scout ship or exploration plane should come within our\r\nrange. Andrews is an important man, you know. Earth won't dismiss him\r\ncasually as 'Lost in Space.' We'll also, as soon as the Sun comes back,\r\nclear a wide swath in the plain below us and construct a huge SOS sign\r\nof wood and underbrush that will be visible by day and can be set afire\r\nby night.\r\n\r\n\"Then, if we should ever hear the signal of a scout ship, we'll hope\r\nthey see our marker.\"\r\n\r\n\"If!\" grunted Sparks.\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Skip it!\" said Hannigan. \"I was just making book against myself.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo Greg maintained an optimism before the others, an optimism he did\r\nnot entirely feel himself. Always he talked of the day they would leave\r\nTitan, but sometimes he wondered if that day would ever come.\r\n\r\nAnd truth to tell, there were periods when he almost hoped that day\r\nwould not ever come! For here, a thousand million miles from the Earth\r\nthat had borne him, Gregory Malcolm had finally come into the rulership\r\nthat, on Earth, he could never win, but that here was his by right of\r\ngreater strength and knowledge.\r\n\r\nHe gazed about him, musing, and saw a cavern bright with candles that\r\n_he_ had taught the womenfolk to render from the fats of wild beasts,\r\nwarm with a flame _he_ had kindled and nurtured, comfortable with\r\nfurnishings _he_ had constructed to their purpose. He saw nine men and\r\nwomen, a half dozen of whom had been his \"superiors\" aforetime, but who\r\nnow looked to him for guidance, protection and leadership.\r\n\r\nHis mind's eye pierced the rock walls of the cavern and gazed,\r\nmarveling, at the cosmos as viewed from desolate Titan. When these\r\nsnows melted he could stand upon the hillside beneath the flaming\r\nmoons of Saturn, beneath the never-ending wonder of Saturn's massive,\r\nmulti-colored Rings, and say with Defoe's ancient castaway that here\r\nhe, indeed, was monarch of all he surveyed.\r\n\r\nThis was his ordained fate; this was his brave, new world; these people\r\nwere his subjects. And he was, for howsoever brief or long a time, an\r\nEmperor. And the white, the whirling stars--these were his empire!\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was not the only one of that group who saw this truth. For\r\nthere was more than mere grudging lip-service in the changed attitude\r\nof Andrews and his wife and son. Bert Andrews was a changed boy. His\r\nwilfulness had vanished; his allegiance to Greg was ardent. Maud\r\nAndrews' affection for Greg was an obvious thing. She saw to it that he\r\nwas first fed, first clothed, first taken care of in all things; hers\r\nwas an attitude of fierce maternalism, springing from a breast that had\r\nnever known motherhood.\r\n\r\nAnd--and there was another strange thing, too. A thing of singing\r\nglory that Greg could scarce believe, even though its truth was\r\nexhibited to him in a thousand little ways.\r\n\r\nCrystal Andrews!\r\n\r\nA great change had come upon Crystal Andrews since the loss of the\r\n_Carefree_. Of the old Crystal, only one part remained. Her blindingly\r\nradiant beauty. Her selfishness, her coldness, had fled, had been\r\nbanished as her accustomed languidness had been banished by the\r\nobligation of labor.\r\n\r\nDaily her attitude toward Greg grew more intimate. From aloofness she\r\nmelted into acceptance, acceptance faded and became approval. Approval\r\nwaxed as transpiring events proved time and again Greg's wisdom and his\r\nright to rule; there came upon the girl an eagerness to be the first to\r\ndo whatever he suggested.\r\n\r\nThis was good, and as it should be. But there was something else, too;\r\nsomething deeper. At first Greg could not understand it, then gradually\r\nits meaning became clear even to his wholly-masculine mind. The sudden\r\nglance ... the lingering touch of hand against hand as they chanced\r\nto pass one another ... the host of unnecessary little questions that\r\nbrought them into contact a dozen times a day ... the sweeping flush\r\nwhen he, looking up unexpectedly, met her gaze. All these and other\r\nthings. The lithe, sure, free, but overwhelmingly feminine allure of\r\nher body, shoulder brushing his as they sat before the fireplace in the\r\nlong evenings. The slow caress of her voice when she spoke his name.\r\nThe moment of swift alarm--a torpid snake that had somehow wriggled\r\ninto the cavern, toward the warmth of the fire--and Crystal in his\r\narms for all too short a moment. And drawing away reluctantly when the\r\n\"danger\" was past.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe should have known from these things. Or from the amused glances of\r\nSparks Hannigan, or the increased surliness of Ralph Breadon, or from\r\nthe sudden loss of gaiety on the part of 'Tina.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you, 'Tina? Don't you feel well lately?\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes avoiding his. \"I'm all right, Greg. It's nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't sing any more. You're sure you're well? There's nothing\r\nI can do for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Her voice low. \"No, thank you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want you to be happy. Look, 'Tina--let's you and me play\r\ncribbage tonight like we used to? We haven't had a game for weeks. How\r\nabout it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Greg--would you like to? Really?\"\r\n\r\nHer dullness slipping away from her like a dropped cape; her voice\r\nthrobbingly eager. Then another voice at his elbow, a throaty,\r\nheart-stirring voice. \"Oh, Greg--me, too? May I play? Will you teach me\r\nthe game?\"\r\n\r\nGreg turned, smiling. \"Why, of course. We'll get Sparks and make it a\r\nfour-handed game. Eh, 'Tina?\"\r\n\r\nBut 'Tina drew back, her eyes hurt again and distant. Her voice faint.\r\n\"N-no, Greg. You and Crystal. I don't think I want to....\"\r\n\r\nWhich Greg could not understand. But gradually, out of his confusion\r\nand miscomprehension, one truth came clear. And with its coming there\r\nwas a sudden singing in his heart, a fire in his veins. He loved\r\nCrystal Andrews. And Crystal Andrews loved him!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen one day they woke to find the floor of the cave glistening darkly\r\nwith a pool of water. The snow was melting from the mouth of the cave.\r\nWhen they attacked the weakened snowbank with shovels and brooms,\r\nlaughing and fighting their way clear of the white barrier, they\r\ndiscovered that the dark days had ended, that once again the sky of\r\nTitan was silver-blue and bright, that already the warmth had turned\r\nthe snow mantle to chuckling rivulets that ran merrily down the hills,\r\nleaving fresh green in its wake. The miracle of Titan's \"winter\" had\r\npassed, and the land would again be theirs for three warm weeks.\r\n\r\nGreg's brain was afire with a hundred projects. A viaduct to carry\r\nwater into the cavern during the next cold period. They had had to\r\ndepend on melted snow this time. A study of the stars with their new\r\nsextant. The clearing of ground for the gigantic signal. He turned to\r\nthe others enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to work now, folks, as we never worked before! Tommy, I\r\nwant you to get right to work on that new viaduct we were talking\r\nabout. Andrews, your first job will be to replenish the wood supply.\r\nTry the west woods, that's the best timber. 'Tina, see what these short\r\n'winters' do to the vegetation, will you? I don't imagine they're dead.\r\nNature has ways of counteracting its own excesses. I believe we'll find\r\nthe vegetation here on Titan is phenomenally hardy. But see, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"Aunt Maud--you and Enid set out those traps we made during the dark\r\nspell. We'll have a hot stew tonight. Breadon, suppose you and Sparks\r\nand I go down to the plain and start planning our signal system?\r\nCrystal--\"\r\n\r\nCrystal was at his side, her hand on his arm. \"I'm going with you,\r\nGreg.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? But they need you--Oh, all right!\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. Behind him Aunt Maud snorted and disguised the snort with\r\na rattling cough. 'Tina looked at him oddly for a moment before she\r\nturned obediently toward where last week there had been a vegetable\r\npatch. Her eyes were hurt. Greg could not understand why.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he was halfway down the hill that he remembered he\r\nhad promised to let her help with the sign project. Of course it was\r\ntoo late to do anything about it then. Besides, Crystal's feet were\r\nunsteady on the melting path. She needed his arm about her for support.\r\nAnd her hair had a tantalizing fragrance all its own....\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IX\r\n\r\nIt took all of the men, working steadily from dawn to dusk every day,\r\ntwo full weeks to construct the signal. When it was done, Greg looking\r\ndown upon it from their hilltop eyrie, gazed upon it with approval and\r\nfound it good.\r\n\r\nAcross the mile-wide flatness of the plain they had heaped huge piles\r\nof branches, faggots, brush, forming the letters \"S O S.\" Green, they\r\nstood out boldly; withered and faded, their brownness would be equally\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nHannigan was pleased with his share of the work, too.\r\n\r\n\"--wire,\" he finished, \"from the bottom of the 'S' to the cave. We just\r\nabout had enough, too. Anyhow, if the ship should happen to come at\r\nnight instead of in the daytime, all we got to do is push the switch,\r\nand a spark'll jump in the tinder. Send the whole signal up in flame in\r\nless time than you can say 'integral calculus.'\" He frowned. \"If,\" he\r\nadded, \"a ship comes at all. Which of course I couldn't say yes or no.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will come,\" said Greg absently. He said it because it was the thing\r\nto say; as a matter of habit. He was not even thinking of his words.\r\nHe was thinking, now that this project had been accomplished, of other\r\nthings. Of a silo that must be built. They had nine head of livestock\r\nnow, due to Tommy O'Doul's persistence. The beasts would have to be\r\nprovided with winter quarters. One goat in the cave had not been so\r\nbad, last month. But nine goats--Perhaps, he thought, that small cave\r\nnext to ours. If we could dig into it through the west wall ... make a\r\nsmall opening....\r\n\r\nHis lack of concentration brought a false conclusion from the third man\r\nin the group. Ralph Breadon stirred restively.\r\n\r\n\"You should say,\" he insinuated, \"if Malcolm _wants_ a ship to come!\"\r\n\r\nThe words penetrated Greg's thoughts of the future slowly. He turned a\r\nblank, questioning look on the other.\r\n\r\n\"Eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"I merely said,\" repeated Breadon, \"that one could not condemn a man in\r\nyour position for showing lack of enthusiasm in a rescue party.\"\r\n\r\nGreg stared at him thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Just what do you mean by that, Breadon?\"\r\n\r\nBreadon shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it fairly obvious? Two short months ago you were a nobody. A\r\nsecretary without background, position or authority. Today you're the\r\ndemigod of Titan. Sir Boss. I don't complain; I merely comment. You\r\nhave everything a man could ask for. Authority ... security ... a\r\nwoman....\"\r\n\r\nThe last jolted Malcolm out of his apathy. He took a swift step\r\nforward, gripped Breadon's lapels with a fist grown heavier, rougher,\r\nwith labor.\r\n\r\n\"If you mean Crystal, Breadon--\"\r\n\r\nBreadon stood his ground. \"Let go of me, Malcolm. I'm not going to\r\nfight you again. Of course I mean Crystal. It's perfectly obvious\r\nthat you and she--Oh, hell, man! Don't be a hypocrite! After all, when\r\npeople live as intimately as we do, in one little cave....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGreg felt dark anger welling up within him like a gall-tinctured\r\nflood. Rage not that Breadon should say this thing, but that there\r\nshould be cause for his thinking it. He choked, thickly, \"Damn you,\r\nBreadon--there's not a thing wrong between Crystal and me. I love her,\r\nyes. And Crystal loves me. We've only been waiting till this big job\r\nwas finished--\"\r\n\r\n\"Then if I were you,\" retorted Breadon wearily, \"I wouldn't wait any\r\nlonger. Or is it another case of the king being incapable of doing\r\nwrong? Anyhow, I think you understand what I mean now. Two months ago\r\na marriage between you and Crystal Andrews would have been ridiculous.\r\nToday--\"\r\n\r\nHe shrugged again. Greg glared at him wrathfully, impotently, for a\r\nlong moment. Then he spun on his heel, led the way down the hill to\r\nthe cave. Sparks scurried along behind him anxiously. \"Now, look,\r\nGreg--don't do nothing you might regret--\"\r\n\r\n\"Shut up! I'll handle this!\"\r\n\r\nAt the cave he called all the settlers before him. They came from their\r\ntasks, surprised, wondering. He wasted no time. He broached the subject\r\nboldly.\r\n\r\n\"Because we ten are marooned here on a desert satellite,\" he said\r\nsavagely, \"without a clergyman, there is no reason we must abandon all\r\nthe rights and privileges of civilized society. Human emotions have a\r\nhabit of enduring. I think it is no secret that Crystal Andrews and I\r\nhave fallen in love. I intend, therefore, to marry her as soon as it\r\ncan be arranged.\r\n\r\n\"Crystal--\" He turned to the girl. \"Do I speak for you as well as for\r\nmyself?\"\r\n\r\nThe girl nodded and stepped forward into the circle of his arm. \"You\r\nknow you do, Greg.\"\r\n\r\nJ. Foster Andrews looked pleased. He said, \"That's fine, son. But who's\r\ngoing to do the marrying?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are. As owner of the _Carefree_, you were also its commander. I\r\nthink the space code would permit your acting in capacity of justice.\"\r\nGreg's anger melted. \"I'm not being very formal about this, sir.\r\nPerhaps I should ask for your permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have it, my boy! And now--\" Archly. \"When will\r\nthe--hrrumph!--happy event take place?\"\r\n\r\nGreg looked at Crystal questioningly. \"Next week?\" she said, \"I'll have\r\nto have a little time, Greg.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it, then,\" said Greg. \"Next week. When the dark period comes.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe little group broke up, then. One by one they murmured words of\r\ncongratulation and approval to their leader and his bride-to-be and\r\ndrifted away. Finally Crystal went back into the cave, and Greg was\r\nleft alone with 'Tina, who alone of all the group, had so far said\r\nnothing. He went to her.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't told me you're happy, 'Tina.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned slowly.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I say so, Greg?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to. Why do you act so strangely toward me, 'Tina? Do you\r\ndislike me? You used to--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm happy,\" she cried suddenly. \"Now I've said it. You want me to.\r\nAre you satisfied? Why don't you let me alone, Greg? Must I like or\r\ndislike you? You have one woman? Must you--\" She broke from his side,\r\nraced forward to the edge of the hill, stared blindly down into the\r\nplain. Greg moved after her, worried. \"What is it, 'Tina? You're _not_\r\nhappy! Are you lonely? Why don't you get married, too? Sparks ... or\r\nBreadon....\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, his gaze over her shoulder settling on something in the\r\nvalley beneath. A thing incredible to behold, but that was ... yes,\r\n_was_....\r\n\r\n\"'Tina!\" he gasped.\r\n\r\nAt the tone of his voice she spun swiftly, anxiously. \"What is it,\r\nGreg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look! Down there! A--a human!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   X\r\n\r\n\"More gruel, Marberry?\" asked Aunt Maud solicitously. \"Can you eat\r\nanother spoonful?\" She glared at those who ringed the reclining\r\nspaceman belligerently. \"Why don't you let him alone?\" she demanded.\r\n\"Greg Malcolm, I thought you had better sense! The man's weak and\r\nsick!\"\r\n\r\nMarberry's eyes were like charred pockets, but he summoned a weak smile.\r\n\r\n\"I'm all right,\" he said. \"There isn't much more to tell. We managed\r\nto cut free from the _Carefree_ just before she crashed. Four of us.\r\nLipstead, Hawkins, Craeburn and myself. Our skiff cracked up in a\r\nmountain gorge. Craeburn was killed, and Lipstead broke his leg. But we\r\nfixed it up in splints, and he got by.\r\n\r\n\"When the snow came--\" He shut his eyes momentarily, as though to rid\r\nthem of a persistently evil vision. \"When the snow came we almost died.\r\nWe ran short on fuel, and the skiff leaked. Then the electro-stove ran\r\ndown, and we had to eat cold, canned food.\r\n\r\n\"Even so, we pulled through. But when it got warm again, Hawkins said\r\nwe mustn't spend another winter in the skiff. We had to find a cave in\r\nthe mountains, he said. So we abandoned the ship and started moving. It\r\nwas then that they caught us.\"\r\n\r\nBreadon, who had entered late, asked, \"Who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Natives of Titan,\" Greg capitulated briefly. \"He described 'em to\r\nus before you came in. Savages. Cannibals. Humanoid, but no culture.\r\nFunny physical make-up, like the Uranians. Don't feel the cold at all.\r\nMurdering devils. From what he says, we're lucky they haven't found us\r\nbefore this.\"\r\n\r\nBreadon said, \"Cannibals!\" and looked sallow. The supine man continued\r\nweakly.\r\n\r\n\"We had to leave Lipstead behind. He couldn't run. He drew a gun on\r\nus, threatened to kill us all if we didn't leave him. We heard his gun\r\nafterward. He must have got a half dozen of them before--before they\r\ngot him.\r\n\r\n\"Then Hawkins and me split up. It was the only way, he said. One of us\r\nmight be lucky. I--I guess I was. They followed him instead of me. And\r\nall the time--\" His voice raised feverishly. \"And all the time, we was\r\nonly about ten miles from here! If we'd only known--\"\r\n\r\nAunt Maud would stand for no more. She bustled between the invalid and\r\nhis listeners, shooed them away angrily. \"Run along, now. This man\r\nneeds sleep and quiet. Go 'way!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut later, as Marberry slept the sleep of exhaustion, Greg called a\r\ncouncil of war.\r\n\r\n\"Ten miles,\" he said soberly. \"If those creatures are only ten miles\r\nfrom here, we can expect an attack almost any day. Or moment. From\r\nnow on, we must keep a watch at all times. No one must leave the cave\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nHannigan said, \"You reckon they'll find us, Greg? Titan's a big hunk of\r\ndirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're savages. Savages can follow the faintest trails of wild\r\nanimals, let alone the spoor of a frightened, sick man. They'll be\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nHannigan said, \"There's one good hunk of news in the whole sorry mess.\r\nMarberry said him and his companions sent out radio SOS calls for three\r\nsolid weeks. Till their radio run dry. Maybe somebody picked up one of\r\nthem calls. Maybe there's help on the way right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Radio. Speaking of radio, Sparks, how about that crystal receiving set\r\nyou were working on? Is it finished?\"\r\n\r\nSparks smiled sourly.\r\n\r\n\"Finished your sainted sandals! It's all washed up. Listen to this!\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped to the hodge-podge of wires and coils on which he had been\r\nlaboring, adjusted it. From its diaphragm came dismal sounds. Squawks,\r\nsqueals, quavering vibrations.\r\n\r\n\"Static,\" said Breadon.\r\n\r\n\"Double it,\" gloomed Hannigan, \"and add a thousand. The worst kind of\r\nstatic. An electrical disturbance field.\"\r\n\r\nGreg frowned. \"But that can't be, Sparks. There's no electricity around\r\nhere. No generating plants or--\"\r\n\r\n\"It can't be,\" snorted Sparks, \"but it is. I don't know what makes it\r\nact thataway. Maybe it's the H-layer of this cockeyed satellite. Sun\r\nspots, maybe. Whatever it is, it sure gums up my machine.\" He stared at\r\nthe tiny set helplessly.\r\n\r\nGreg stirred himself.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then we'll have to look forward to fighting this battle without\r\nhope of assistance. Andrews, I want you and Tommy to inspect the\r\ncave-mouth barrier immediately, see that it's in perfect shape and\r\nreinforce it. Ralph, you and Sparks drive the livestock into the small\r\ncave so they'll be hidden. 'Tina, the fuel reserve?\"\r\n\r\n\"Complete, Greg.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! I'm going out to stand the first watch. If you need me, I'll\r\nbe--\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment a small figure, bristle-haired with excitement, came\r\nscampering into the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Greg!\" cried Tommy O'Doul. \"Greg--they're down there! On the plain. I\r\nseen them. And I--I think they seen me, too! They're heading up this\r\nway!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA half hour later, Greg, flanked by a tight-jawed little band of\r\ncompatriots, crouched in the bottle-mouth of an altered cavern.\r\n\r\nThe short time that had elapsed since Tommy O'Doul gave the alarm had\r\nbeen minutes of swift preparation. What little of water, food and\r\nsupplies could be brought into the cave had been hustled in by eager\r\nhands. The stock had been herded into the small, adjoining cave, and\r\nboulders had been rolled against the cave mouth. The metal grill had\r\nbeen dropped before the mouth of their own cave; it was behind this\r\nthey now crouched, through this that Greg looked out upon a lead-gray\r\nsky and green hills.\r\n\r\n\"There's one thing,\" said Greg. \"One break in our favor. It's starting\r\nto get darker, and it's barely afternoon. We must be dipping into the\r\npenumbra of Saturn. In a little while the darkness should come, and the\r\ngales and the cold.\"\r\n\r\nHannigan said, \"That ain't no break for us. Marberry said they didn't\r\nfeel heat and cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know. But they can't prevent the snow falling. If it comes down like\r\nit did during the last dark spell, we will have an eight-foot fall of\r\nice between us and our attackers.\"\r\n\r\nAndrews looked at the sky anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"But until it snows, Greg?\"\r\n\r\n\"We fight!\" said Greg grimly.\r\n\r\nBert Andrews, who had wriggled forward on his belly to the furthermost\r\nell of the bottle-neck, ducked back hastily, twisted his head over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Then we fight now!\" he rasped. \"Here they come!\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that the Earth-exiles saw, for the first time, the dominant\r\nrace of Saturn's sixth satellite. To see was to marvel that Nature had\r\nonce again--as on Earth, Mars, Uranus and Io--selected the bipedal\r\nhumanoid form in creating a ruling race. Except for the thick, downy\r\npelts that covered these Titanians' bodies, the low, slanting, bestial\r\nforeheads, the depth of breast and rapacious mouth slits, these\r\ncreatures were the counterparts of man.\r\n\r\nBut there were other unapparent differences, thought Greg. Marberry\r\nhad reported the Titanians impervious to heat and cold, which argued a\r\ndifference in normal body temperature and perhaps a difference in basic\r\nmetabolism. There must be sharp differences between man's mentality\r\nand that of these man-like beasts, as well, else they would not come\r\nseeking their interplanetary guests as the huntsman seeks his quarry.\r\n\r\nA long, questing, silver-pelted line, they climbed the hillside path\r\nto the flat clearing before the cave. They paused there, peering about\r\nthem suspiciously, nostrils wide and eyes searching. Greg realized,\r\nsuddenly, that these man-things were far down humanity's scale; so much\r\nof the animal was in them that they placed more dependence in their\r\nolfactory than in their visual sense. They seemed to catch the man\r\nscent, the spoor they had been following. Their leader moved forward to\r\nthe grillwork. Hannigan's shoulder brushed that of Greg as he wriggled\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Greg? Shall we let 'em have it?\"\r\n\r\nGreg whispered hurriedly, \"When I give the word, all fire at once.\r\nRemember, we have very little ammunition. We must make every shot\r\ncount. Ready?\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced at his all-too-tiny fighting crew. Bert Andrews, old J.\r\nFoster, Breadon, Sparks, himself. \"Tommy,\" he ordered, \"go back into\r\nthe cave!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw!\" said Tommy--but obeyed. Greg glanced about him once more. Others\r\nof the Titanians had slunk to their leader's side now. Their voices,\r\nguttural and mono-syllabic, carried plainly over the few intervening\r\nyards.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" cried Greg.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFive rifles spoke as one. Their conjoined thunder beat deafeningly upon\r\nthe sweating cavern walls, echoed and re-echoed, ripping at Greg's\r\neardrums. But another sound pierced the roar of gunfire. The shrill,\r\npain-laden screams of stricken man-things. The inquisitive leader fell\r\nwithout ever knowing the cause of his death. A Titanian behind him\r\nopened his slit-mouth in a flat, high scream, turned to run, tearing\r\nat his gaping chest with claws that crimsoned as he tore. He took\r\nthree steps, toppled, crashed. Another body was beneath his own; still\r\nanother fell upon his.\r\n\r\nOld J. Foster's lips were white. He turned to Greg, sickened and\r\ntrembling.\r\n\r\n\"We can't do this, Greg! It's slaughter!\"\r\n\r\nA weak voice cackled derision. \"Don't feel sorry for 'em. If they get\r\nin here, they'll show you what a real slaughter looks like. Malcolm,\r\nhave you got a gun for me?\"\r\n\r\nIt was the sailor, Marberry. Greg said, \"Go back and rest a while\r\nlonger, Marberry. We have no more guns.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get Tommy's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rest. This siege may last all day, all night or for a week. You'll get\r\nyour turn.\"\r\n\r\nMarberry disappeared. Greg said, \"Fire! Keep on firing! They're\r\nbewildered. Maybe they'll break and run.\"\r\n\r\nAgain the salvo of gunfire rocked the corridor, and again foremost\r\nfigures slumped to the ground, slicing the ranks of the attackers. But\r\nnow, peering through the grill, Greg saw that he had underestimated the\r\nmanpower of the attackers. They were not a dozen or two dozen ... there\r\nwere a hundred of them milling, now, in the small clearing, and the\r\npath was still clogged with the silvery bodies of others lumbering to\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\nWhat happened in the next hour was such stuff as nightmares are made\r\nof. At first Greg cautioned himself each time he pulled the trigger of\r\nhis rifle that he must make his shot count; later he fell into a dull,\r\nscarce-comprehending state of mono-existence wherein he was conscious\r\nonly of the nerveless and repeated movements of his hands.\r\nAim ... load ... fire! Aim again ... load ... fire ... aim....\r\n\r\nAnd at first there was little need for aiming. For the Titanians,\r\nsavagely prodigal of life, knew only one way of fighting--to press\r\nforward in brute force, attempting to crush down the metal grill that\r\nstood between them and their vengeance. To fire into that thick press\r\nof bodies was sure havoc. The Titanians were weaponless save for the\r\ncudgels they whirled about their heads threateningly; nor could they\r\nbreak down the barrier so long as the succeeding hands of all who\r\ngripped it became the limp, impotent hands of the dead.\r\n\r\nThen at last even their dim, animal intelligence saw that this was a\r\nlosing battle. A cry rose and was shuttled from mouth to mouth. The\r\nsilvery figures, now gray in ever-gathering dusk, wisped away from the\r\ncave-mouth.\r\n\r\n\"Licked 'em!\" cried Hannigan. \"They're running, by Peter! Golly, Greg!\r\nLook at that pile out there!\"\r\n\r\nThere was awe in his voice, distaste in Greg's eyes as he looked on\r\nthe motionless mound heaped before the cave. But Greg said, \"Don't get\r\nrash! They may be planning a new attack. Breadon--what's wrong with\r\nyou, man?\"\r\n\r\nRalph Breadon grinned wryly.\r\n\r\n\"Fortune's favored child, that's me! They didn't have any weapons to\r\nshoot me with, so I shot myself. Bounced a bullet off the grill. It\r\ncame back and pinked my arm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go get it dressed. There it comes!\" cried Greg.\r\n\r\n\"The new attack?\" Sparks whirled.\r\n\r\n\"The darkness. And the snow!\"\r\n\r\nHe was right. The threatened period of darkness had descended at last.\r\nOnce again Titan was within the shadow of its primary. And once again\r\nthe vast winds were keening from the hilltops, the great flakes of snow\r\nwere tumbling from a lifeless sky. Greg's voice was exultant.\r\n\r\n\"Now we're safe! In an hour or so we'll be behind a fortress of ice.\r\nAnd I don't think they'll lay siege to us in a blizzard for a solid\r\nweek.\"\r\n\r\nHis triumph was short-lived. For even as he anticipated victory,\r\ndisaster beat on the portals of their refuge. From the depths of the\r\ncave came a shrill scream, the shout of Marberry, and Tommy's frantic\r\ncry--\r\n\r\n\"Greg! Come a-running! They've found the back entrance!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe back entrance! Greg's heart lurched. He cursed himself, suddenly,\r\nfor having tried to accomplish too much in making their cavern\r\nhabitable. For by so doing, he had rendered them vulnerable in a spot\r\nwhere there would be no barrier of ice an hour hence.\r\n\r\nThe back entrance. The archway they had broken out between their large\r\ncave and the smaller one wherein Tommy's livestock was herded. Somehow\r\nthe Titanians had found the other cave, rolled away the boulders, and\r\nwere now attempting to get at their quarry from the rear.\r\n\r\nGreg shouted, \"Andrews, you stand guard here! One man will be enough.\r\nThe rest of you--come on!\"\r\n\r\nThe first of the Titanians was pushing through the cleft just as he\r\nreached the main chamber. There was a look of unholy glee on the\r\nman-like creature's thin lips as he attained the cave. But it died\r\nthere, suddenly, frostily. It was not Greg who dropped him. It was\r\nyoung Tommy, staggering under the recoil of a rifle almost as tall as\r\nhimself, firing pointblank, bouncing back to reload manfully, bawling\r\nwith youthful glee, \"Got him, Greg!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen there was no time for speech, because the Titanians were pouring\r\nthrough the breech in a howling, flame-eyed mob. For a moment Greg,\r\neven as he fought, felt despair touch his heart with leaden fingers.\r\nThere was no grill here to bar the enemy's passage; the cleft was wide\r\nenough to admit three at a time. He and his companions were outnumbered\r\nten, twenty to one.\r\n\r\nBut he did not, could not, take into consideration two vital facts.\r\nThe first was the indomitable gallantry of his fellow exiles. He had\r\nexpected that, in defense of their lives, their possessions, their\r\nwomen, the armed men would fight to the last breath. And they did.\r\nPressing forward on relentless feet. Breadon, Andrews, Bert, Hannigan.\r\nBut Greg had not realized that the women, too, could fight. As in\r\na smoke-veiled dream he caught glimpses of their activities. Aunt\r\nMaud and 'Tina, armed with huge ladles, dipping their weapons into\r\na massive pot of boiling water, flinging the scalding liquid at the\r\ncold-impervious but heat-sensitive invaders. Crystal, no longer a\r\nserene and radiant beauty, but a flaming Valkyr whose ash-blonde hair\r\ntumbled about her, forgotten, gaining a vantage point at the very lip\r\nof the opening, slashing ferociously at the attackers with a monstrous\r\ncleaver. Enid Andrews racing to the wall, digging in Greg's duffle,\r\npressing something into his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Your flame-pistol, Gregory!\"\r\n\r\nGreg grasped it eagerly. \"Stand back, Crystal!\"\r\n\r\nShe turned, and saw, and fled. And the ochre flame mushroomed into the\r\nheart of the still-charging Titanians. Their charge stilled, faltered,\r\nwavered, died. The stench of charred bodies was nauseous. Then there\r\nwere screams of fear--and the Titanians were in rout!\r\n\r\nInto the small cave they pursued them; from it but a handfull of the\r\nsilver-pelted savages escaped. And when the last living invader had\r\ndisappeared, Greg turned to his exhausted followers with a smile of\r\nweary triumph.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see no more of them,\" he promised. \"Already the snow is a foot\r\ndeep. By morning both caves will be completely walled in. And I think\r\nwe've taught them to fear us. What, 'Tina?\"\r\n\r\nFor she was standing before him; her eyes were cool and positive ...\r\nthere was decision in her tone.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it was all over for us a moment ago,\" she said. \"And I knew,\r\nthen, Greg, that it was a mistake for me to die without having told\r\nyou. I promised myself that if a miracle occurred ... and we should\r\nlive ... I would tell you.\"\r\n\r\nHe said wonderingly, \"But what, 'Tina? I don't--\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you don't, Greg. That is why I must say it. I love you. Have\r\nloved you since that first day.\" Her eyes were grave. Greg's were\r\nembarrassed.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"But you--you shouldn't say such things, 'Tina. Crystal--\"\r\n\r\n\"She is a brave woman, Greg. But she is not your woman. She is his.\"\r\n\r\nHis gaze followed 'Tina's across the room, to where Crystal knelt\r\nbeside the injured Breadon. She was cleansing his wound, which was as\r\nit should be. But there was a softness, a tenderness, to her\r\nmotions ... and a look in her eyes. Greg looked away, suddenly aware\r\nthat even from the beginning he had felt this barrier between them.\r\nPerhaps Crystal had loved him, for a while and in a fashion. But she\r\nloved him for his strength, his power, his ability to rule. She was a\r\nwoman of the ruling class; ever her conscious trend would be toward\r\nallegiance with those who led. But in the show-down ... when instinct\r\novercame logic....\r\n\r\nHannigan cried across the chamber, \"What, Greg?\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say anything,\" said Greg gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"But you did. I heard you say--_Omigawd!_\" Sparks made a sudden leap\r\ntoward the bench on which rested the forgotten crystal set. \"It's this!\r\n_Listen!_\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStatic still boiled through the speaker of the tiny set. But now, above\r\nthe static, riding its vibrations, was superimposed the sound of a\r\nhuman voice. And the voice was calling, over and over again,\r\n\r\n\"_Space Patrol Cruiser Orestes ... calling survivors of the Carefree.\r\nWe are looking for you. Where are you ... where are you? Come\r\nin, Carefree survivors. Space Patrol Cruiser Orestes ... calling\r\nsurvivors_....\"\r\n\r\nGreg looked at 'Tina. Then once again at Crystal, whose face, upturned\r\nwith sudden, speechless joy, was the radiant vision of unattainable\r\nperfection. Then at Sparks, whose gaze met his reluctantly. He said,\r\n\"Sparks--press the plunger.\"\r\n\r\nHannigan's hand moved slowly toward the control that would set into\r\nflame the gigantic brush-signal on the plain below. With strange\r\nreluctance, everything considered. For certainly Sparks realized\r\nas plainly as he, Greg, that the snow was falling with increasing\r\nrapidity, that the cruiser must be almost directly overhead for its\r\nsignal to penetrate the raucous interference of static, that if this\r\nopportunity were lost it might be years and years before....\r\n\r\nSparks voice was low in his ears.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure, Greg?\"\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly there was deathly silence in the cave. Never until that\r\nmoment had Gregory Malcolm realized how completely was he the ruler of\r\nthis tiny clan. Here, where all life and the future of life and the\r\nfuture of these men and women were concerned, the last great judgment\r\nwas relegated to him.\r\n\r\nHe looked about him uncertainly. And what he read in his comrades' eyes\r\nsurprised him. For there was reluctance in the eyes of Bert Andrews ...\r\na vague regret in those of old J. Foster Andrews ... hope and pleading\r\nin those of the girl 'Tina ... frank disapproval in those of the woman\r\nthey knew as 'Aunt Maud.' Only the eyes of Crystal Andrews, who were\r\nhe to let the cruiser pass might be his wife, was there mirrored fear\r\nand apprehension....\r\n\r\nHe shook himself. And with that small gesture he shrugged from his\r\nshoulders an ermine that had lain there all too briefly. Quietly he\r\nsaid the words that stripped him of his sceptre, that swept away his\r\nempire of the stars.\r\n\r\n\"Press it, Sparks!\" he said.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"A remarkably ingenious device, sir,\" said Captain Allengrove\r\napprovingly. \"And you made use of it in the nick of time. We were just\r\nabout to abandon the search when the snowy waste beneath us blossomed\r\nsuddenly with that signal. I'm sorry we couldn't get here sooner, sir.\r\nBut--\" And he glanced about the cavern appreciatively. \"But you appear\r\nto have had matters under control.\"\r\n\r\nJ. Foster Andrews said, \"Well--er--Captain, as a matter of fact, it\r\nwasn't--hrrumph!--altogether my doing. Greg, here--\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Allengrove dismissed Malcolm with a glance.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, I quite understand. One couldn't expect you to take care of\r\nall the minor details. But I must say, Mr. Andrews, you are a fortunate\r\nman. Inasmuch as you established residence on Titan, the Federation\r\nwill be forced to acknowledge your priority claim to the heretofore\r\nunknown ore deposit near your cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"The--er--ore deposit?\" Andrews looked blank.\r\n\r\nSparks hollered, \"Oh, my sainted tonsils! The swamp! Of course!\r\nPitchblende! That's why there was so much static interference! Radium!\"\r\n\r\nThe cruiser's commander frowned on him.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly. Of course, Mr. Andrews, you cannot file a full claim to the\r\nproperty. That requires a full year's residence. And a man as important\r\nas yourself--\"\r\n\r\nGreg Malcolm started. He had said nothing up till now. He had been\r\ngiven an opportunity to say nothing. The captain had addressed himself\r\nsolely to the one \"important\" man in their party, the man for whom,\r\nprimarily, the search had been made, the man to whose \"genius\" was\r\nattributed the existence of the castaways.\r\n\r\nNow he spoke up. He said, \"But _I_ am establishing residence, Captain\r\nAllengrove.\"\r\n\r\nAllengrove permitted himself the luxury of a small smile.\r\n\r\n\"You, Malcolm? But really, my dear fellow, only a spaceman could\r\nundertake such a task. A _secretary_--\"\r\n\r\nAunt Maud waddled forward belligerently. She said, \"Secretary--pah!\r\nFiddle-faddle, Captain! You don't know what you're talking about! And\r\nas for you, Brother Jonathan, I'm ashamed of you! Taking credit for\r\nall this--arragh!\" She turned to Greg. \"Gregory, I'm an old woman, and\r\nperhaps I'm an old fool, as well. But I've had more fun and excitement\r\nin the past month than I've had in the previous forty years. Be--be\r\n_damned_ if I'll go back to Earth and piddle away my remaining years at\r\noperas and pink teas. I'm staying here with you!\"\r\n\r\nEnid Andrews, into whose shoulders had so quickly come the grace and\r\nease of authority that was her charm, looked shocked. \"Maud!\" she\r\nexclaimed.\r\n\r\nSparks Hannigan breathed a sigh of relief. \"Then that makes three of\r\nus,\" he said. \"Any more takers?\"\r\n\r\nTommy O'Doul pushed his way to Greg's side. \"Can I stay, too, Greg? Can\r\nI, huh? Me, too?\"\r\n\r\nGreg said gratefully, \"If you want to, Tommy. But, Bert--_you_?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor Bert Andrews had also aligned himself with his aunt and Sparks. Now\r\nhe said defiantly, \"What Aunt Maud says is good enough for me. I'll\r\nstick!\"\r\n\r\n'Tina was already beside Greg; her gaze was fiercely loyal. She did not\r\nneed to say anything. Captain Allengrove looked stunned. \"But really,\"\r\nhe said, \"but really, this is most unusual! I mean, we were sent to\r\nrescue you! I--er--I don't quite see how you expect to survive without\r\nleadership--\"\r\n\r\nAunt Maud snorted belligerently. \"Leadership! You just leave us\r\nsupplies and we'll have all the leadership we need! Marberry, you're\r\nstaying, aren't you? Well, that's seven of us. A lucky number! I don't\r\nsuppose there are any more?\"\r\n\r\nShe glared at Crystal. Greg, too, was watching the girl. Now before the\r\nsteadfastness of their combined gazes, her eyes dropped. Her cheeks\r\ncolored faintly. But she did not move from Breadon's side. She said,\r\n\"I--I'm sorry. I hope you understand, Greg.\"\r\n\r\nGreg said, \"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore,\" declared Aunt Maud staunchly, \"I'm warning you,\r\nJonathan! I know you! If you go home bragging about your part in the\r\ncolonization of Titan, I'll follow you, so help me! And if you fail to\r\nkeep us equipped with supplies--\"\r\n\r\nJ. Foster said hurriedly, \"Now, Maud!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Allengrove looked at them all uncomprehendingly. It didn't make\r\nsense. But he was a Space Officer--it was not his place to engage in\r\nfamily quarrels; his duty was to rescue what few of this astonishing\r\ncrew wished to be rescued. He coughed nervously. He said, \"Well, Mr.\r\nAndrews--if you're ready now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said J. Foster. \"We're ready now. Goodbye, Greg,\" he said.\r\n\"And--er--thanks, old boy!\"\r\n\r\nGreg said levelly, \"That's all right. Goodbye.\" He said, less levelly,\r\n\"Goodbye, Miss Andrews.\"\r\n\r\nBut Crystal and Breadon were already turning toward the portal, toward\r\nthe cruiser that would carry them back to an easier, gentler world.\r\nSo at the end, there were no last farewells. Just a single word, and\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nYet somehow, strangely, Greg Malcolm did not mind too much. For in\r\nlosing one thing, he had found much more. He was bulwarked with\r\ngreater, truer friends than most men ever know ... he stood in a\r\ncave that was his home ... on a new world that was yet his shining,\r\nunblemished empire.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the touch of a warm hand on his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Wanderers of the Wolf-Moon, by Nelson S.
