WARREN, M.D.\r\n          PRESIDENT OF THE BOSTON SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: Logo]\r\n\r\n                                BOSTON:\r\n                          TICKNOR AND FIELDS,\r\n                        135, Washington Street.\r\n                                 1854.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BOSTON:\r\n                   PRINTED BY JOHN WILSON AND SON,\r\n                          22, School Street.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal part of these remarks were made at the meetings of\r\nthe BOSTON SOCIETY OF NATURAL HISTORY. A portion of them also\r\nhave been printed in the Proceedings of the Society.\r\n\r\nThe object of this publication is to afford to those who are not\r\nmembers of the Society an opportunity of obtaining some knowledge\r\nof Fossil Impressions, which they might not be able to obtain\r\nelsewhere so conveniently.\r\n\r\nSome account of the Epyornis seems to be very properly connected\r\nwith Ornithichnites.\r\n\r\nThe first of these papers was written in October, 1853; the others\r\nin the earlier part of the present year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: Epyornis]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE EPYORNIS;\r\n\r\n                                 OR,\r\n\r\n                 GREAT BIRD OF MADAGASCAR, AND ITS EGGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of the year 1851, an account was circulated of the\r\ndiscovery of an immense egg, or eggs, in the Island of Madagascar. The\r\nsize of the eggs spoken of was so disproportionate to that of any\r\npreviously known, that most persons received the account with\r\nincredulity; and, I must confess, I was one of this number. Being in\r\nParis soon after hearing of this report, I made inquiry on the\r\nsubject, and was surprised to learn, that the great egg was actually\r\nexisting in the Museum of Natural History in Paris. In a few days I\r\nhad an opportunity of seeing a cast of it in the hands of the artist,\r\nM. Strahl, of whom I solicited one. He informed me that it could not\r\nbe obtained at that moment; but that, if my request were made known to\r\nthe Administration of the Museum, he had no doubt they would accede to\r\nit. I accordingly did apply, and also presented them with the cast of\r\na perfect head of Mastodon Giganteus; and they very liberally granted\r\nmy request.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished naturalist, Professor Geoffroy St. Hilaire, the\r\nsecond of that honorable name, has made a statement to the Academy of\r\nSciences, which, though only initiatory, contains many facts of a very\r\ninteresting nature, some of which I have had an opportunity of\r\nverifying; and to him we are indebted for a greater part of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe eggs sent to me are, in number, two; one of which was purchased by\r\nM. Abadie, captain of a French vessel, from the natives. Another was\r\nsoon afterwards found, equal in size. A third egg was discovered in an\r\nalluvial stratum near a stream of water, together with other valuable\r\nrelics of the animal which had probably produced them; but,\r\nunfortunately, it was broken during transportation. Of the two eggs,\r\none is of an ovoid form, having much the shape of a hen's egg; and the\r\nother is an ellipsoid.\r\n\r\nThe ovoid egg is of enormous size, even when compared with the largest\r\negg we are acquainted with. Its long diameter exceeds thirteen inches\r\nof our English measure, its short diameter eight, and its long\r\ncircumference thirty-three inches. Its capacity is thought to be equal\r\nto eighteen liquid pints, or to be six times greater than that of the\r\nlargest egg known to us (the ostrich), although but twice its length.\r\nIt is said to be equal to a hundred and forty-eight hen eggs. The\r\nellipsoid egg has its longest diameter somewhat less than that of the\r\novoid; its short diameter nearly equals that of the other egg, being\r\nmore than eight inches. The third egg, although broken, has been very\r\nuseful to science, by displaying the thickness of the shell, which is\r\nabout one-tenth of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe bones, of which I have received the casts, are three in number,\r\nand of great interest. One of them is a characteristic fragment of the\r\nupper part of a fibula; the other two, still more interesting, as\r\nenabling us to determine the class and genus of the animal to which\r\nthey belong, exhibit the extremities of the right and left\r\ntarso-metatarsal bones. The former is somewhat broken; the latter is\r\nnearly perfect, and exhibits the triple division of the inferior\r\nextremity of the bone into the three trochleae or pulley-shaped\r\nprocesses of the struthious birds. It might be mistaken for a bone of\r\nthe great Dinornis, but is distinguished from this by the flatness of\r\nthe portion above the trochleae. Still less is it one of the bones of\r\nthe ostrich, its three pulleys being separated from each other by\r\ndistinct intervals; whereas the pulleys of the ostrich have only one\r\nsuch separation, constituting two distinct eminences.\r\n\r\nM. Geoffroy St. Hilaire considered himself justified, from these and\r\nother facts, in deciding this bone to belong to a bird of a new genus,\r\nto which he gives the name of EPYORNIS, from _aipys_, _high_,\r\n_tall_, and _ornis_, _bird_; and, as probably it is a specimen of the\r\nlargest animal of the family, he affixes the specific name of\r\n_maximus_.\r\n\r\nThe size of this bird, inferred from that of its egg, would be vastly\r\nsuperior to that of the ostrich. But if we notice the comparative size\r\nof the trochleated extremity of the tarso-metatarsal bone, we shall\r\nsee that its height would be greatly exaggerated by adopting such a\r\nbasis for its establishment; in fact, it would not probably exceed a\r\nheight double that of the ostrich. And, though it must have been\r\nsuperior to that of the Dinornis maximus of Prof. Owen, it might\r\nperhaps excel it only by the difference of two or three feet. A bird\r\nof twelve or thirteen feet in height would, however, if we stood in\r\nits presence, appear enormous, and must have greatly astonished and\r\nterrified the natives of Madagascar. Whether it now exists is\r\nuncertain, as it may possibly have a habitation in the wild recesses\r\nof the island, which have never yet been visited by any European\r\ntraveller.\r\n\r\nThe credit of most of the observations and discoveries relating to\r\nthis remarkable bird is attributable to French naturalists;[A] and it\r\nseems to be a duty devolving on English and American navigators to\r\ncomplete the history thus happily begun, and to tell us whether the\r\nEpyornis still exists in the mountain-forests of Madagascar, or at\r\nleast present us with its extraordinary relics.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote A: The following are the names of French travellers, who\r\n  have been supposed to have seen the eggs of the Epyornis in the\r\n  Island of Madagascar: M. Sganzin, in 1831; M. Goudot, in 1833; M.\r\n  Dumarele, in 1848; and M. Abadie, in 1850.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      FOSSIL IMPRESSIONS.--I.\r\n\r\n\r\nIchnology, a newly created branch of science, takes its name from the\r\nGreek word _ichnos_, a _track_ or _footstep_, and the tracks\r\nthemselves have been denominated Ichnites, or, when they refer to\r\nbirds only, Ornithichnites, from _ornis_, a _bird_. And this last term\r\nhas by custom been generally applied to ancient impressions, though\r\nnot correctly.\r\n\r\nGeology has revealed to us not only the remains of animals and\r\nvegetables, but the impressions made by them during their lives, and\r\neven the impressions of unorganized bodies. The first notice of these\r\nappearances was, as often happens, regarded with indifference or\r\nscepticism; but their number and variety enlightened the public mind,\r\nand opened a new source of information and improvement.\r\n\r\nThe first remarkable observation made on fossil footsteps was that of\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Duncan, of Scotland, in 1828. He noticed, in a _new red\r\nsandstone_ quarry in Dumfriesshire, impressions of the feet of small\r\nanimals of the tortoise kind, having four feet, and five toes on each\r\nfoot. They were seen in various layers through a thickness of forty\r\nfeet or more.\r\n\r\nSandstone, in which these impressions are principally discovered, is a\r\nrock composed chiefly of siliceous and micaceous particles cemented\r\ntogether by calcareous or argillaceous paste, containing salt, and\r\ncolored with various shades of the oxide of iron, particularly the\r\nred, gray, brown. It has been remarked by Prof. H. D. Rogers, that the\r\nperfection of the surface containing fossil footmarks is often\r\nattributable to a micaceous deposit. The layers of sandstone have been\r\nformed by deposits from sea-water, dried in succession; such layers\r\nare also seen in the roofing slate. These deposits on the shores of\r\nthe ocean, having in a soft condition received the impressions of the\r\nfeet of birds, other animals, vegetables, and also of rain-drops,\r\nunder favorable circumstances dried, hardened, and formed a rock of\r\ngreater or less solidity. Our colleague, Dr. Gould, has exhibited to\r\nus a specimen of dried clay from the shores of the Bay of Fundy,\r\ncontaining beautiful impressions, recently made, of the footsteps of\r\nbirds. The particles brought by the waves, and deposited in the manner\r\ndescribed, were derived from the destruction of other rocks previously\r\nexisting, particularly granite and flint, or silex, the shining atoms\r\nof which compose no small part of the sandstone rock.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive, that, while these deposits were taking place\r\nin the soft condition, portions of vegetable matters might become\r\nintermixed; and that these, with the impressions of the feet and other\r\nparts of animals and unorganized substances, might be preserved by the\r\nprocess of desiccation. The agency of internal heat may have also been\r\nemployed in some cases in baking and hardening these crusty layers.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone rock, though in some places actually in a state of\r\nformation at the present time, lies in such a manner in the earth's\r\ncrust as to indicate an immense antiquity. The age of these beds\r\nvaries in different situations. The sandstone rocks which contain the\r\ngreater part of the impressions are called _new red sandstone_, to\r\ndistinguish them from the _old red_, which is of a greater age. The\r\ndeposits on Connecticut River may not be attributed to the action of\r\nthis river, but are of higher antiquity, probably, than the river\r\nitself, and proceeded from the waves of an ancient sea, existing in a\r\nstate of the surface of the globe very different from that of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nIn 1834, tracks were discovered near Hildberghausen in Saxony, to\r\nwhich Prof. Kaup, of Darmstadt, gave the name of Chirotherium, from\r\nthe resemblance to the impressions of the human hand. On a subsequent\r\nexamination, Prof. Owen preferred the name of Labyrinthodon, from the\r\nresemblance of the folds in the teeth to the convolutions of the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nVarious other instances of impressions were seen; and, in the year\r\n1835, Dr. Deane and Mr. Marsh, residents of Greenfield, noticed\r\nimpressions resembling the feet of birds in sandstone rocks of that\r\nneighborhood. These observations having come to the knowledge of\r\nPresident Hitchcock, of Amherst College, that gentleman began a\r\nthorough investigation of the subject, followed it up with unremitted\r\nardor, and has, since 1836 (the date of his first publication), laid\r\nbefore the public a great amount of ichnological information, and\r\nreally created a new science. Dr. Deane, on his part, has not been\r\nidle: besides making valuable discoveries, he has written a number of\r\nexcellent papers to record some portion of his numerous observations.\r\n\r\nIn 1837, at the request of my friend Dr. Boott, I carried to London,\r\nfor the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, various scientific\r\nobjects peculiar to this country; among which were a number of casts\r\nof Ornithichnites.\r\n\r\nThese casts were kindly furnished me by President Hitchcock, and the\r\nGovernment of the Royal College thereon voted to present to President\r\nHitchcock and Amherst College casts of the skeleton of the famous\r\nMegatherium of South America. These casts were packed, and sent to be\r\nembarked in a ship destined for Boston, but were unluckily delivered\r\nto a wrong shipping house in London, and I lost sight of them for some\r\ntime. They were at length discovered. After remaining in this\r\nsituation for more than a year, they were sold at public auction; and,\r\nnotwithstanding many efforts on my part, I was unable to obtain and\r\ntransmit them to Amherst College.\r\n\r\nThe fossil impressions which have been distinguished in various places\r\nin the new red sandstone are those of birds, frogs, turtles, lizards,\r\nfishes, mollusca, crustacea, worms, and zoophytes. Besides these, the\r\nimpressions made by rain-drops, ripple-marks in the sand, coprolites\r\nor indurated remains of faeces of animals, and even impressions of\r\nvegetables, have been preserved and transmitted from a remote\r\nantiquity. No authentic human impressions have yet been established;\r\nand none of the mammalia, except the marsupials.(?) We must, however,\r\nremember that, although the early paleontology contains no record of\r\nbirds, the ancient existence of these animals is now fully\r\nascertained. Remains of birds were discovered in the Paris gypsum by\r\nCuvier previous to 1830. Since that time, they have been found in the\r\nLower Eocene in England, and the Swiss Alps; and there is reason to\r\nbelieve that osseous relics may be met with in the same deposits which\r\ncontain the foot-marks. Most of the bird-tracks which have been\r\nobserved, belong to the wading birds, or Grallae.\r\n\r\nThe number of toes in existing birds varies from two to five. In the\r\nfossil bird-tracks, the most frequent number is three, called\r\ntridactylous; but there are instances also of four or tetradactylous,\r\nand two or didactylous. The number of articulations corresponds in\r\nornithichnites with living birds: when there are four toes, the inner\r\nor hind toe has two articulations, the second toe three, the third toe\r\nfour, the outer toe five. The impressions of the articulations are\r\nsometimes very distinct, and even that of the skin covering them.\r\n\r\nPresident Hitchcock has distinguished more than thirty species of\r\nbirds, four of lizards, three of tortoises, and six of batrachians.\r\n\r\nThe great difference in the characters of many fossil animals from\r\nthose of existing genera and species, in the opinion of Prof. Agassiz,\r\nmakes it probable that in various instances the traces of supposed\r\nbirds may be in fact traces of other animals, as, for example, those\r\nof the lizard or frog. And he supports this opinion, among other\r\nreasons, by the disappearance of the heel in a great number of\r\nOrnithichnites.\r\n\r\nD'Orbigny, to whom we are indebted for the most ample and systematic\r\nwork on Paleontology (\"Cours Elementaire de Paleontologie et de\r\nGeologie,\" 5 vols. 1849-52), does not accept the arrangement of\r\nPresident Hitchcock. He objects to the term Ornithichnites, and\r\nproposes what he considers a more comprehensive arrangement into\r\norganic, physiological, and physical impressions. _Organic\r\nimpressions_ are those which have been produced by the remains of\r\norganized substances, such as vegetable impressions from calamites,\r\n&c. _Physiological impressions_ are those produced by the feet and\r\nother parts of animals. _Physical impressions_ are those from\r\nrain-drops and ripple-marks; and to these may be added coprolites in\r\nsubstance. This plan of D'Orbigny seems to exclude the curious and\r\ninteresting distinctions of groups, genera, and species; in this way\r\ndiminishing the importance of the science of Ichnology.\r\n\r\nFossil impressions have been found on this continent in the\r\ncarboniferous strata of Nova Scotia, and of the Alleghenies; in the\r\nsandstone of New Jersey, and in that of the Connecticut Valley in a\r\ngreat number of places, from the town of Gill in Massachusetts to\r\nMiddletown in Connecticut, a distance of about eighty miles.\r\n\r\nA slab from Turner's Falls, obtained for me by Dr. Deane in 1845,\r\nmeasuring two feet by two and a half, and two inches in thickness,\r\ncontains at least ten different sets of impressions, varying from five\r\ninches in length to two and a half, with a proportionate length of\r\nstride from thirteen inches to six. All these are tridactylous, and\r\nrepresent at least four different species. In most of them the\r\ndistinction of articulation is quite clear. The articulations of each\r\ntoe can readily be counted, and they are found to agree with the\r\ngeneral statement made above as to number. The impressions are\r\nsingularly varied as to depth; some of them, perfectly distinct, are\r\nsuperficial, like those made by the fingers laid lightly on a mass of\r\ndough, while others are of sufficient depth nearly to bury the toes;\r\nsome of the tracks cross each other, and, being of different sizes,\r\nbelong to animals of different ages or different species. There is one\r\ncurious instance of the tracks of a large and heavy bird, in which,\r\nfrom the softness of the mud, the bird slipped in a lateral direction,\r\nand then gained a firm footing; the mark of the first step, though\r\ndeep, is ill-defined and uncertain; the space intervening between the\r\ntracks is superficially furrowed; in the settled step, which is the\r\ndeepest, the toes are very strongly indicated. On the same surface are\r\nimpressions of nails, which may have belonged to birds or chelonians.\r\n\r\nThe inferior surface of the same slab exhibits appearances more\r\nsuperficial, less numerous, but generally regular. There are three\r\nsets of tracks entirely distinct from each other; two of them\r\ncontaining three tracks, and one containing two,--the latter being\r\nmuch the largest in size. In addition, there is one set of tracks,\r\nwhich are probably those of a tortoise. These marks present two other\r\npoints quite observable and interesting. One is that they are\r\ndisplayed in relief, while those on the upper surface are in\r\ndepression. The relief in this lower surface would be the cast of a\r\ncavity in the layer below; so the depressions in the upper surface\r\nwould be moulds of casts above. The second point is the\r\nnon-correspondence of the upper and lower surfaces; i.e. the\r\ndepressions in the upper surface have not a general correspondence\r\nwith the elevations on its inferior surface. The tracks above were\r\nmade by different individuals and different species from those below.\r\nThis leads to another interesting consideration, that in the thickness\r\nof this slab there must be a number of different layers, and in each\r\nof them there may be a different series of tracks.\r\n\r\nTo these last remarks there is one exception: the deep impression in\r\nwhich the bird slipped in a lateral direction corresponds with an\r\nelevation on the lower surface, in which the impression of these toes\r\nis very distinctly displayed, and even the articulations. Moreover,\r\none of the tracks on the inferior surface interferes with the outer\r\ntrack in the superior, and tends in an opposite direction, so that\r\nthis last-described footstep must have been made before the other. It\r\nis also observable, that, while all the other tracks are superficial,\r\nthis last penetrates the whole thickness of the slab; thus showing\r\nthat the different deposits continued some time in a soft state.\r\n\r\nOn the surfaces of this slab, particularly on the upper, there are\r\nvarious marks besides those of the feet, some of which seem to have\r\nbeen made by straws, or portions of grass, or sticks; and there is a\r\ncurved line some inches in length, which seems to have arisen from\r\nshrinkage.\r\n\r\nIn the collection of Mr. Marsh,[B] there were two slabs of great size,\r\neach measuring ten by six feet, having a great number of impressions\r\nof feet, and about the same thickness as the slab under examination.\r\nOne of these presented depressions; and the other, corresponding\r\nreliefs. These very interesting relations were necessarily parted in\r\nthe sale of Mr. Marsh's collection; one of them being obtained for the\r\nBoston Society of Natural History, and the other for the collection of\r\nAmherst College.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote B: Mr. Marsh was a mechanic of the town of Greenfield,\r\n  and procured his subsistence by his daily labor. Being employed by\r\n  Dr. Deane in obtaining the sandstone slabs of Ornithichnites, he\r\n  acquired a taste for the pursuit, entered into it with\r\n  extraordinary ardor, and accumulated by his own labors a great\r\n  collection of fine specimens. He unfortunately fell into a\r\n  consumption, and died in 1852. The collection was sold at public\r\n  auction for a sum between two and three thousand dollars. The\r\n  specimens were purchased by the Boston Society of Natural History,\r\n  by Amherst College, and by varioud colleges and scientific\r\n  associations in this country.]\r\n\r\nThe _Physical Impressions_, according to Professor D'Orbigny, are\r\nof three kinds, viz.: 1st, Rain-drops; 2d, Ripple-marks; and 3d,\r\nCoprolites. I have a slab which exhibits two leptodactylous\r\ntracks very distinct, about an inch and a half long, surrounded\r\nby impressions of rain-drops and ripple-marks. Another specimen\r\nexhibits the impressions of rain in a more distinct and remarkable\r\nmanner. The imprints are of various sizes, from those which might\r\nbe made by a common pea to others four times its diameter; some\r\nare deep, others superficial and almost imperceptible. They are\r\ngenerally circular, but some are ovoid. Some have the edge equally\r\nraised around, as if struck by a perpendicular drop; and others\r\nhave the edge on one part faintly developed, while another part is\r\nvery sharp and well defined, as if the drop had struck obliquely.\r\nIt has been suggested, that these fossil rain-drops may have been\r\nmade by particles of hail; but I think the variety of size and\r\ndepth of depression would have been more considerable if thus\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have necessarily treated the subject of fossil\r\nfootmarks in a very brief way, sufficient has been said to show\r\nthat this new branch of Paleontology may lead to interesting\r\nresults. The fact that they are, in some manner, peculiar to this\r\nregion, seems to call upon our Society to obtain a sufficient\r\nnumber of specimens to exhibit to scientific men a fair\r\nrepresentation of the condition of Ichnology in this quarter of\r\nour country; and we have therefore great reason to congratulate\r\nourselves, that, through the vigilance and spirit of our members,\r\nthe Society has the expectation of obtaining a rich collection\r\nof ichnological specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     FOSSIL IMPRESSIONS.--II.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince writing the preceding article, I have been able to obtain,\r\nthrough the kindness of President Hitchcock, a number of additional\r\nspecimens of fossil impressions. By the aid of these, I may hope to\r\ngive an idea of the system of impressions, so far as it has been\r\ndiscovered, without, however, attempting to enter into minute details.\r\nFor these, I would refer to the account of the \"Geology of\r\nMassachusetts,\" by President Hitchcock; to his valuable article\r\npublished in the \"Memoirs of the American Academy;\" and to his\r\ngeological works generally.\r\n\r\nThe numerous tracks which have been assembled together in the\r\nneighborhood of Connecticut River have afforded an opportunity of\r\nprosecuting these studies to an extent unusual in the primitive rocky\r\nsoil of New England. These appearances are not, indeed, wholly new.\r\nSuch traces had been previously met with in other countries; but, in\r\ntheir number and variety, the valley of the Connecticut abounds above\r\nall places hitherto investigated.\r\n\r\nTwenty years have elapsed since the study of Ichnology has been\r\nprosecuted in this country; and, in this period of time, about\r\nforty-nine species of animal tracks have been distinguished in the\r\nlocality mentioned, according to President Hitchcock; which have been\r\nregularly arranged by him in groups, genera, and species.\r\n\r\nI propose now to lay the specimens, recently obtained, before the\r\nSociety, as a slight preparation for the more numerous and more\r\nvaluable articles which they are soon to receive.\r\n\r\nThe traces found on ancient rocks, as has been shown in the previous\r\narticle, are those of animals, vegetables, and unorganized substances.\r\nThe traces of animals are produced by quadrupeds, birds, lizards,\r\nturtles, frogs, mollusca, worms, crustacea, and zoophytes. These\r\nimpressions are of various forms: some of them simple excavations;\r\nsome lines, either straight or curved, and others complicated into\r\nvarious figures.\r\n\r\nPresident Hitchcock has based his distinctions of fossil animal\r\nimpressions on the following characters, viz.:--\r\n\r\n     1. Toes thick, pachydactylous; or thin, leptodactylous.\r\n     2. Feet winged.\r\n     3. Number of toes from two to five, inclusive.\r\n     4. Absolute and relative length of the toes.\r\n     5. Divarication of the lateral toes.\r\n     6. Angle made by the inner and middle, outer and middle toes.\r\n     7. Projection of the middle beyond the lateral toes.\r\n     8. Distance between tips of lateral toes.\r\n     9. Distance between tips of middle and inner and outer toes.\r\n    10. Position and direction of hind toe.\r\n    11. Character of claw.\r\n    12. Width of toes.\r\n    13. Number and length of phalangeal expansions.\r\n    14. Character of the heel.\r\n    15. Irregularities of under side of foot.\r\n    16. Versed sine of curvature of toes.\r\n    17. Angle of axis of foot with line of direction.\r\n    18. Distance of posterior part of the foot from line of direction.\r\n    19. Length of step.\r\n    20. Size of foot.\r\n    21. Character of the integuments of the foot.\r\n    22. Coprolites.\r\n    23. Means of distinguishing bipedal from quadrupedal tracks.\r\n\r\nBy these characters, President Hitchcock has distinguished\r\nphysiological tracks, or those made by animated beings, into ten\r\ngroups provisionally. To these may be added, \"organic impressions,\"\r\nmade by organized bodies; and the impressions made by inanimate\r\nbodies, called \"physical impressions.\"\r\n\r\nThe specimens under our hands enable us to give some notion of the\r\ndistinctions which characterize the greater part of these groups.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                     GROUP FIRST--STRUTHIONES.\r\n\r\nThe ostrich-tracks present a numerous natural and most remarkable\r\ngroup; remarkable from the great size of some species,--all of them\r\ntridactylous and pachydactylous. The ostrich of the Old World has only\r\ntwo toes, but this family exists in South America at the present time\r\nunder the name of Rhea Americana; and tracks of an animal, probably of\r\nthe same family, are found in the numerous impressions near\r\nConnecticut River,--all of them having three toes in front, and the\r\nrudiment of a fourth behind.\r\n\r\nThis group contains a number of genera. The FIRST GENUS, denominated\r\n_Brontozoum_, presents the tracks of a most extraordinary bird. These\r\ntracks appear less questionable since the discovery in Madagascar of\r\nthe eggs of the Epyornis.\r\n\r\nThe tracks of the largest species, the BRONTOZOUM GIGANTEUM, are\r\nfour times the magnitude of those made by the existing ostrich of\r\nAfrica. They are very numerous, and congregated together. The foot of\r\nthe Brontozoum Giganteum, including the inferior extremity of the\r\ntarso-metatarsal bone, which makes a part of the foot, measures in our\r\nspecimen twenty inches; in the Mastodon Giganteus, the foot measures\r\ntwenty-seven inches; the width also is less, being ten inches across\r\nthe metacarpals, while that of the Mastodon is twenty-two: but the one\r\nis a bird, the other a quadruped. The toes are three in number, and\r\npresent the same divisions with existing birds; the inner toe having\r\nthree, the middle four, the outer five phalanges. Some of the\r\narticulations of the toes of this noble specimen are remarkable for\r\nthe manner in which they illustrate the mode of formation of the\r\ntracks. These phalanges have become separated from the solid rock in\r\nwhich they were encased, so as to be removable at pleasure; and they\r\nthus show that the whole foot is not a simple impression in the rock\r\nwhich contains it, but a depression filled by foreign materials, i.e.\r\nby sand, clay, and other relics of pre-existing rocks. These materials\r\nhad been gradually deposited in the mould formed by the bird's foot,\r\nand are therefore independent of this rock, in the same way as the\r\nplaster-of-Paris cast of a tooth, or any other body, is independent of\r\nthe mould to which it owes its form. The impressions are in gray\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nOn the reversed surface of the slab is seen a small piece of broken\r\nquartz, about half an inch square. This piece forms a beautiful\r\nillustration of a part of the process by which the sandstone rocks are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nThe second species of the same genus is the BRONTOZOUM SILLIMANIUM.\r\nOf this we have three specimens; the tracks have the same general\r\ncharacter with the preceding, but are smaller.\r\n\r\nThe third species of this genus is styled the BRONTOZOUM LOXONYX,\r\nfrom _loxos_, a _bow_, and _onyx_, a _nail_,--a curved nail. It is\r\nsmaller than the Sillimanium, and has the nail set to one side.\r\n\r\nThe fourth species, still smaller, is the Brontozoum Gracillimum. On\r\nthis slab the impressions are in relief; viz.: 1st, of Brontozoum\r\nGracillimum; 2d, of Brontozoum Parallelum; 3d, of the track of a\r\ntortoise, fourteen inches long, and two wide. Other extensive\r\neminences and depressions, with rain-drops, may be observed on the\r\nsame surface.\r\n\r\nThe fifth species is called BRONTOZOUM PARALLELUM, from the tracks\r\nbeing on a line with each other. Of this there are two specimens, one\r\nof them, however, being a single track. On the surface of the other\r\nslab there are at least five distinct tracks, one of them being a\r\nsmall new and undescribed species,--thus making the whole number of\r\nspecies of Brontozoum which we possess to be at least six.\r\n\r\nThe SECOND GENUS of Struthiones is called _AEthyopus_, from\r\n_aithuia_, a _gull_, and _pous_, a _foot_,--gull-footed. This genus\r\nis smaller than the Brontozoum Giganteum; and we have two species,\r\nviz. the AETHYOPUS LYELLIANUS, which is the larger, and two specimens\r\nof AETHYOPUS MINOR. All of these are distinguished from the preceding\r\ngenus by the winged foot, and in the Lyellianus by the shallowness of\r\nthe impression. The AEthyopus Minor is not always distinguished by the\r\nsuperficiality of its impression. This is sometimes deep. Therefore\r\nthis character may not be considered a distinctive one, or the\r\nAEthyopus Minor might be referred to another genus. Of the two\r\nspecimens of this latter species, the first is in depression,\r\ntridactylous. The depressions are deep with rain-drops, marks of\r\nquadrupeds and zoophytes over the whole surface. The ornithichnic\r\nimpressions are two in number; one superficial, the other very deep.\r\nThe reversed surface of this slab contains one tridactylous impression\r\nin relief. The second specimen has three depressions; two of which are\r\nsuperficial, and the third is quite deep, displaying, by a depressed\r\nsurface, the webbed character of the foot.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            GROUP SECOND.\r\n\r\nWe shall take, to characterize this group, the _Argozoum_, from\r\n_arges_, _swift_, _winged_.\r\n\r\nOf this genus there are two species, the larger of which is the\r\nARGOZOUM DISPARIDIGITATUM. It is leptodactylous, and remarkable for\r\nthe length of the middle toe. We have another species, which is\r\nsmaller than the last named, and in which the toes are nearly of equal\r\nlength; hence called ARGOZOUM PARIDIGITATUM.\r\n\r\nThe other genus of this group is the PLATYPTERNA, and our specimen\r\nis named _Deaniana_. This genus is remarkable for the width of the\r\nheel; hence the name, from _platys_, _broad_, and _pterna_, _a heel_.\r\nIt has three toes like the other genera of this group.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             GROUP THIRD.\r\n\r\nThis and the succeeding group are tetradactylous; having one toe\r\nbehind, three forwards.\r\n\r\nThe third group is leptodactylous; foot usually small, but sometimes\r\nof medium size. Of it we have two specimens, viz.: ORNITHOPUS\r\nGALLINACEUS, and ORNITHOPUS GRACILIS. The former is so called from the\r\nresemblance to the domestic fowl: for convenience sake, in this and\r\nother instances, we use the whole for a part. It is about three inches\r\nin length, and the Ornithopus Gracilis about two.\r\n\r\nThis latter specimen is particularly interesting. It consists of two\r\nparts, which open like the covers of a book. These covers present four\r\nimpressions: first, the superficial, which is distinct, slender, and\r\nbeautiful--the heel is broad; second, corresponding with this\r\ndepression and on the inside, is a figure in relief as distinct as the\r\ndepression; third, on the inside of the second cover is a depression\r\ncorresponding with the relief last mentioned; fourth, on the outer\r\nside is a second relief corresponding with the second depression, but\r\nless distinct than either of the other three, still, however,\r\nexhibiting three toes pointing anteriorly, but the hind toe is\r\nwanting. The whole of this double slab forms a series of cameos and\r\nintaglios, measuring four inches by three, and in thickness an inch\r\nand a quarter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            GROUP FOURTH.\r\n\r\nOf the fourth group we have five specimens. The _Triaenopus_, so called\r\nfrom its resemblance to a trident, has besides three leptodactylous\r\ntoes pointing forwards, a fourth extending backwards in a remarkable\r\nway, like the handle of a trident; the impression, however, being\r\nexpanded so as to show an extensive displacement of the mud. All the\r\nspecimens of Triaenopus are in a beautiful red shale, very thin and\r\nfragile, but presenting well-defined impressions, generally about\r\nthree inches long.\r\n\r\nThere are two species to this genus. Of the TRIAENOPUS EMMONSIANUS we\r\nnotice three impressions in relief. In another specimen there is the\r\nappearance of a part of the toes of the Anomoepus Scambus, and on the\r\nupper side are seen two excavations corresponding with the three\r\nimpressions. In the last slab, the track of the TRIAENOPUS BAILEYANUS\r\nappears to have been made by two feet placed successively in the same\r\nspot, which led President Hitchcock to suspect it might have been made\r\nby a quadruped. One of the specimens has the Triaenopus tracks\r\nintermixed in a peculiar way with other impressions.\r\n\r\nThe specimen representing the genus HARPEDACTYLUS is larger than the\r\npreceding; and, though leptodactylous, the toes are much broader and\r\nalso more curved, whence the name Harpedactylus, _sickle-finger_, from\r\n_harpe_ and _daktylos_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             GROUP FIFTH.\r\n\r\nThe fifth group differs much from the four previous ones. In this and\r\nthe following groups we pass from the vestiges of birds to those of\r\nother animals, some of which are bipeds, some quadrupeds. Many\r\nimpressions are without any distinct character, belonging probably to\r\nthe lower animals, to vegetables, and unorganized bodies.\r\n\r\nThe fifth group comprehends the tracks of an extraordinary animal, the\r\nOTOZOUM.[C] The name which has been given to it is taken from that\r\nof an ancient giant, Otus, who with his brother Ephialtes, according\r\nto heathen mythology, made war with the gods. These fabled giants\r\nwere, at nine years of age, nine cubits in width and nine fathoms in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n  [Footnote C: The specific name of Moodii has been attached to the\r\n  Otozoum, from its having been discovered by Mr. Moody.]\r\n\r\nThe foot is divided into four toes; the two outer of which seem to be\r\nconnected by a common basis. The inner toe has three phalanges; the\r\nsecond toe, also three; the third and fourth toes, four each. The\r\nfirst is the shortest, the second longer, the third longest, the\r\nfourth shorter than the third. It will appear, then, that this track\r\ndiffers from that of birds in the number of toes pointing forwards;\r\nthese being four, while in birds the forward toes are only three.\r\nThere is a difference also in the number and arrangement of the\r\narticulations.\r\n\r\nThe track in our possession is twenty inches long by thirteen and a\r\nhalf inches broad. The rock in which it is imbedded is a dark-colored\r\nsandstone. President Hitchcock has a slab showing a regular series of\r\ntracks of this animal; the distance between the steps being about\r\nthree feet, and the tracks equidistant and alternate, which would not\r\nbe the case if the animal had been quadrupedal. In a quadruped, the\r\nhorse for example, the hind feet are set down near the fore feet, and\r\nsometimes even strike them. Hence it must be inferred that the track\r\nin question was that of a biped, or of a quadruped which did not use\r\nits fore feet in progression, like a kangaroo. We naturally ask, What\r\nkind of biped could this have been? Evidently not a man, the size of\r\nthe foot being too large to admit such a supposition; nor could it\r\nhave been a bird, the number of toes and their direction not admitting\r\nthis hypothesis.\r\n\r\nTetradactylous birds, or those which have four toes, have only three\r\nof them directed forwards, and the fourth backwards, generally. There\r\nare, however, exceptions; some birds have four toes directed forwards:\r\nthis is the fact with the Hirundo Cypselus and the Pelicanus Aquilus\r\nof Linnaeus, or Man-of-war Bird. But the articulations are different in\r\nthe two animals, birds having regularly two, three, four, and five\r\nphalanges, and the spur, where it exists, supported by a single\r\nosseous phalanx; whereas the Otozoum has three phalanges in the inner\r\nand second toe, four in the third and fourth toes. In this last\r\narrangement, the Otozoum is decidedly different from all known birds.\r\nIt is not likely to have been a tortoise or a lizard. The kangaroo has\r\nfour feet, and uses only two in progression, moving forward by leaps;\r\nalso, like the Otozoum, it has four toes; but the size of the toes\r\ndoes not accord with that of the Otozoum, nor is the structure of the\r\nfoot the same, so far as we know. It has been suggested by Professor\r\nAgassiz, that this animal might have been a two-footed frog. Nature\r\nhad, in those days, animal forms different from those we are\r\nacquainted with; and this might have been the fact with the Otozoum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             GROUP SIXTH.\r\n\r\nWe have in this group a specimen of the track of a four-footed animal,\r\nwhich may have been a frog, though different from ours. The feet are\r\nunequal in size, and present a different number of toes. In existing\r\nfrogs there are four toes in the fore feet, and five in the hind; but,\r\nin the specimen before us, the front toes are five in number, and the\r\nback toes three. It is called, therefore, ANOMOEPUS, _unequal-footed_.\r\nThese impressions are in the red shale of Hadley, and very distinct.\r\nIn some of them the lower leg is indicated, forming an impression six\r\nor seven inches long. The feet being smaller than the legs, the\r\nimpression made by the latter is more expanded, superficial, and\r\nbroader, yet still very definite. The opinion of President Hitchcock\r\nand Dr. Deane is, that the different impressions of five and three\r\ntoes are those of the anterior and posterior extremities of one animal,\r\nwhich, from the size of the limbs, might be a frog three feet high.\r\n\r\nOn the same schist with these footmarks, are other curious\r\nimpressions. The back of the slab is almost covered with the imprints\r\nof rain-drops. In the midst of these is a tridactylous impression,\r\nprobably of a quadruped, crossed at its root by a single depression,\r\nnearly an inch broad, and two and a half long: this seems to form part\r\nof another broad superficial impression of about seven by four inches,\r\nwhich is probably also quadrupedal. Other parts present the\r\nimpressions of nails and worm-tracks. At the opposite end is a deep,\r\nsmooth, regular excavation, which might have been made by a Medusa.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            GROUP SEVENTH.\r\n\r\nThe seventh group contains the impressions of the feet of Saurians or\r\nlizards. We have a specimen of quadrupedal marks, with five toes to\r\neach foot, about an inch long, which may have been made by these\r\nanimals. The impressions are small, but very distinct. There are\r\nlizards of the present day with five toes, about the size of these\r\nimpressions; and these may, therefore, be set down as belonging to\r\nthis order of reptiles. Like a number of the last-named specimens,\r\nthey are in red shale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            GROUP EIGHTH.\r\n\r\nThe eighth group is assigned by President Hitchcock to the Chelonian\r\nor turtle tribe. The slab bearing impressions of Brontozoum\r\nGracillimum has a mark about fourteen inches long and two wide, which\r\nmay be attributed to the plastron or breast-plate of the tortoise. On\r\nthe slab from Turner's Falls there is a longitudinal furrow, which\r\nmight have been made by the tail of a turtle; and in various of our\r\nslabs are impressions which we think belong to this tribe. We shall\r\nhave occasion to notice hereafter remarkable tracks of these animals\r\nin the old red of Morayshire, in Scotland.\r\n\r\nThe most distinct of the traces of chelonians are on the large slab\r\nlately obtained for me by President Hitchcock from Greenfield. (_Vide_\r\nPlate.) This interesting slab contains the traces of quadrupeds,\r\nvarious birds, and two trails of chelonians: the largest of these is\r\nnearly five feet long, and four inches in diameter. The trail is\r\ncomposed of a number of parallel elevations, comparatively\r\nsuperficial.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             GROUP NINTH.\r\n\r\nOf the ninth group, containing the marks of Annelidae, Crustacea, and\r\nZoophytes, we have various specimens.\r\n\r\nThe impressions of insects do not seem as yet to have been\r\ndistinguished on the ancient rocks. There is reason to believe,\r\nhowever, that many of the marks we discover in the rocky beds might\r\nhave been made by the feet and bodies of large insects; and small\r\nspecies of the same tribes have been found imbedded in, and actually\r\nconstituting, immense masses of calcareous and siliceous rocks.\r\n\r\nThe tracks of worms are numerous. No doubt these worms drew together a\r\nconcourse of birds to the shores on which they rolled. On various\r\nslabs we find long cylindrical furrows, about the eighth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and of different lengths; one of them, in the slab from Dr.\r\nDeane, being eight or nine inches long. To these impressions the name\r\nof HERPYSTEZOUM, from _herpystes_, _crawling_, has been given. They\r\nvary, however, and some of them are very likely to be the tracks of\r\nthe common earth-worm, or of some species of worm which existed when\r\nthese rocks were formed. These impressions vary in length and in\r\ndiameter; some of them are moderately regular, and others irregularly\r\ncurved.\r\n\r\nVery interesting tracks have been found in the ancient Potsdam white\r\nsandstone of Beauharnais, on the St. Lawrence, by Mr. Logan, an\r\nexcellent geologist of Canada, and determined by Professor Owen to\r\nbelong to Crustacea, crabs. The number of impressions made by each\r\nfoot is sometimes seven, sometimes eight, and even more. This track,\r\nshowing the traces of Crustacea, goes to form another link in the\r\nchain of fossil footsteps.\r\n\r\nThe Medusae, commonly called jelly-fish, dissolving as they do under\r\nthe influence of the sun and air, would hardly be expected to leave\r\ntheir traces impressed on ancient rocks. Professor D'Orbigny, however,\r\nhas watched the dissolution of these animals on the sea-shore, and\r\nfound that, after wasting, they may leave their impressions on the\r\nsand; which, not being disturbed by a high tide for nearly a month,\r\nretains the impression of the zoophyte, and serves as a mould to\r\nreceive materials which take a cast and transmit it to subsequent\r\nages. We find one of these impressions on the slab of the Anomoepus\r\nScambus; and President Hitchcock, having examined it, is of opinion\r\nthat it retains the traces of a Medusa. The impression is about five\r\ninches in diameter, of a darker color and smoother texture than the\r\nrest of the rock. Its edges fade away gradually in the surface of the\r\nsubjacent sandstone. A similar impression is found on the superior\r\nsurface of the slab containing the Argozoum.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                             GROUP TENTH.\r\n\r\nThe tenth group contains the HARPAGOPUS, a name derived from\r\n_harpage_, _seizure_, _rapine_. It is represented by President\r\nHitchcock as having the form of a drag. The figure given by him\r\nresembles in a degree the foot of the African ostrich; being a long\r\nthick toe, with a shorter one, not unlike a thumb, on the side. An\r\nimpression approximating this, but of small size, may be seen on the\r\nslab of the Anomoepus Scambus.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe formation of bird-tracks is well represented by a clay specimen,\r\nabout an inch thick, and ten inches long. This is a piece of dried\r\nclay, obtained by President Hitchcock from the banks of the\r\nConnecticut, and produced by washings from clay on the shore above,\r\ncovered with foot-impressions of a small tridactylous bird, and dried\r\nin the sun. This piece shows, in a way not to be questioned, the\r\nmanner in which the ancient vestiges were produced. Sir Charles Lyell\r\nnoticed a similar fact on the banks of the Bay of Fundy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ORGANIC IMPRESSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _second_ great division of fossil impressions is called ORGANIC,\r\nmeaning impressions made by organized bodies; the bones of animals,\r\nfishes, and vegetables.\r\n\r\nNear one extremity of the slab of the Ornithopus Gallinaceus is an\r\nelevation, about a foot long, and between one and two inches wide,\r\nprojecting from the surface nearly half an inch. It has the appearance\r\nof a round bar of iron imbedded in the rock, which is clayey\r\nsandstone. This apparent bar of iron was probably a bone, buried in\r\nthe stone, now silicified and impregnated with iron; the animal matter\r\nhaving entirely disappeared. In the slab of the Brontozoum Sillimanium\r\nis a projection about seven or eight inches long, and half an inch\r\nwide; probably the bone of an animal, perhaps a clavicle of the\r\nBrontozoum Giganteum.\r\n\r\nThe vestiges of fishes are very numerous in the sandstone rocks of\r\nConnecticut River. We have not less than two dozen specimens from this\r\nlocality; a number equal to all the other specimens in our collection.\r\nThese impressions of fishes are generally from three to six inches\r\nlong, and three or four inches wide. They are of the grand division\r\ndenominated by Professor Agassiz \"heterocercal,\" having their tails\r\nunequally bilobed, from the partial prolongation of the dorsal spine;\r\nand they are considered to be of lower antiquity than the fishes which\r\nare entirely heterocercal. The most remarkable of the fish-specimens\r\nin our collection is a CEPHALASPIS (?): this fish is found in the\r\nspecimen containing tracks of the Brontozoum Gracillimum, and traces\r\nof a turtle or tortoise. This fossil was discovered in the upper layer\r\nof the old red sandstone of Scotland, and had been mistaken by some\r\nfor a trilobite: to us it appeared to be a Limulus, but further\r\nobservation leads us to believe it to be a _Cephalaspis_. It exhibits\r\na convex disc, four inches across, by two inches from above downwards,\r\nand a tail at right angles with the disc, the uncovered part of which\r\nis three inches long. The animal has been described by Professor\r\nAgassiz as being composed of a strong buckler, with a pointed horn at\r\neither termination of the crescent, and an angular tail.\r\n\r\nTo the vegetable impressions discovered among the sandstone rocks a\r\npeculiar name has not yet been assigned. When, however, we consider\r\nthe strong probability that many impressions of stalks, leaves,\r\nfruits, and other parts of vegetables, may be hereafter discovered in\r\nthese rocks, it will be found convenient to have a distinctive\r\ndenomination. Vast numbers of vegetable impressions of a distinct and\r\nbeautiful appearance, and in great variety, have been found in the\r\ncoal-formation, which is nearly allied to the sandstone: such are the\r\nSigillaria, Stigmaria, Equisetaceae, Lycopodiaceae, Coniferae, Cycadeae,\r\n&c. It is sufficient to say that the number of these has been already\r\nswelled to many hundreds: we must also believe, that some of the\r\nimpressions in sandstone rocks which have been assigned to other\r\nsubstances ought to be attributed to vegetables. We may, therefore,\r\nventure to call the vegetable impressions \"phytological.\"\r\n\r\nA number of our slabs bear impressions of vegetables; either twigs of\r\ntrees, or spires of plants. In a fragment broken from one of the toes\r\nof the Brontozoum Giganteum, we see a cylindrical depression, three\r\ninches long, and half an inch in diameter, marked by transverse lines,\r\nabout the sixth of an inch apart, and presenting an unquestionable\r\nappearance of a fragment of a twig of an ancient vegetable, which had\r\nbeen trodden under the foot of the mighty Brontozoum. On the reversed\r\nsurface of the same slab are found impressions, which were produced by\r\na number of fragments of sticks, five or six inches long, lying at\r\nright angles, or nearly so. One of these sticks has been broken, and\r\nits pieces are slightly displaced from each other. Various other\r\nspecimens contain the marks of sticks, or twigs of trees. The striae,\r\nso distinctly discernable in a number of these portions, having been\r\ncompared with twigs of the existing coniferae (?), were found to\r\nresemble them. Some of these sticks show the appearance of incipient\r\ncarbonization; yet the rock is sandstone, presenting, as already\r\nmentioned, distinct appearances of quartz, and other substances of\r\nwhich the arenaceous rocks are composed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PHYSICAL IMPRESSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _third_ great division of impressions in the sandstone rocks is\r\ncalled PHYSICAL, meaning those made by inanimate and unorganized\r\nsubstances; such are rain-drops, ripple-marks, and coprolites.\r\n\r\n1. Marks of rain-drops, described on page 20, appear to be quite\r\ncommon. We have two or three specimens in relief, and as many in\r\ndepression. They occur as follows: 1st, on the upper surface of the\r\nslab first described; 2d, on that of the Platypterna; 3d, on that of\r\nthe AEthyopus Lyellianus; 4th, on that of the Brontozoum Gracillimum;\r\n5th, on that of the AEthyopus Minor; 6th, on that of the Anomoepus\r\nScambus; 7th, on the recent clay; also in one small hand-specimen, and\r\nin a second containing two fishes. They show that, in those ancient\r\nperiods when the Brontozoum Giganteum and the Otozoum resided in these\r\nparts, showers were frequent, and probably abundant for the supply of\r\nthe wants and the gratification of the appetites of these animals,\r\nthen common, but which now appear to us so extraordinary.\r\n\r\n2. Ripple-marks are seen in a number of these pieces; for example, on\r\nthe slab first described, on the Brontozoum Sillimanium slab, on the\r\nBrontozoum Gracillimum slab, on one of the Triaenopus, and on the upper\r\nsurface of the Greenfield slab. These marks are represented by\r\nparallel curves, or straight lines, distant from each other from half\r\nan inch to an inch, and presenting a slight degree of prominence.\r\nThere is another form of ripple-marks(?), differing from those above\r\ndescribed. These are of a circular and mammillary form: they are\r\nstrewed thickly, like little islets, approximating to each other. They\r\nare seen distinctly on one of the slabs of the Brontozoum Sillimanium,\r\non that of the AEthyopus Lyellianus, and some others. Whether they are\r\nto be considered as accumulations of sand and clay, formed by the\r\naction of the sea, we are uncertain; but there seems to be no other\r\ncause to which they can be assigned with so great probability.\r\n\r\n3. _Coprolites_, the fossilized ejections of animals, are intermixed\r\nwith other animal vestiges in the sandstone of Connecticut River, and\r\nafford additional proof of the former existence of animals about these\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe latest accounts of fossil footprints we have had occasion to\r\nnotice are those of the Crustacea, already mentioned, as found in\r\nCanada, and of the Chelonian in Scotland. The Canadian impressions,\r\ncalled by Professor Owen Protichnites, were discovered in the year\r\n1847, and were laid before the London Geological Society in 1851. The\r\nmost remarkable circumstance about them was their existence, as\r\nalready stated, in a white sandstone, near the banks of the River St.\r\nLawrence, at Beauharnais. This sandstone, which has been described by\r\nNew York geologists under the name of Potsdam, is thought to belong to\r\nthe Silurian system, and to have a higher antiquity than even the \"old\r\nred.\"\r\n\r\nThe Scotch footsteps are situated in the old red sandstone, and are\r\nthose of a Chelonian. So that we have now two series of tracks, the\r\nCrustacea in Canada and the Chelonian in Scotland, of higher antiquity\r\nthan any which had been previously discovered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn a review of the labors of President Hitchcock, we are struck with\r\nadmiration at the immense details that, in the midst of arduous\r\nofficial and literary duties, he has been able to go through with in\r\nthe period since the foot-tracks were discovered on Connecticut River.\r\nAlthough his labors should be modified by succeeding observers,\r\nScience must be ever grateful to him for laying the foundation, and\r\ndoing so much for the completion, of a work so great, novel, and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThis inquiry seems to us to promise a rich variety; and we hope that\r\nPresident Hitchcock and other observers will continue to explore and\r\ncultivate it with undiminished zeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Photography for enabling us to represent the\r\nremarkable slab from Greenfield, and its numerous objects, in a small\r\nspace, yet with perfect accuracy. This slab is four feet seven and\r\none-half inches in one direction, and four feet one inch transversely\r\nto this; in thickness it measures about an inch. It is composed of\r\ngray sandstone, in which the micaceous element is conspicuous, and\r\ncontains many interesting impressions on both surfaces.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting surface is the inferior; and the objects are, of\r\ncourse, presented in relief. They are, first, two Chelonian tracks;\r\nsecond, four sets of bird-tracks; third, footsteps of an unknown\r\nanimal. The _Chelonian tracks_ are two in number: the longest measures\r\nfour feet ten inches; the shorter, two feet nine inches. Both of these\r\nimpressions are made apparently by the plastron of the turtle. They\r\nare from four to eight inches in width, and composed of elevated\r\nstriae. These striae are formed by raised lines, pursuing a course\r\ngenerally regular, but accompanied with some inflections: they are, as\r\nthe plate represents, very distinct. The shorter track appeared to me\r\nto be crossed by another; but the photographic impression, though only\r\na few inches long, enabled me to ascertain that this appearance was\r\nproduced by bird-tracks above and below.\r\n\r\nThe _bird-tracks_ are all tridactylous. The first set lies above and\r\nto the right of the shorter turtle-track, and is composed of only two\r\nsteps, proceeding in the course of the plate downwards. The second set\r\nof bird-tracks has five impressions, extending from the right superior\r\npointed angle of the slab across the small turtle-track to the larger,\r\nin which it is lost. The third set of bird-tracks begins by an\r\nimpression larger than any other on the piece at the left extremity of\r\nthe longer turtle-track; and the remainder, three in number,\r\ndescending towards the right, are the least distinct of any. The\r\nfourth set of bird-tracks begins below the longer turtle-track, and\r\nascends by four impressions, crossing the track till it meets the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe most curious track, consisting of six digitated impressions, still\r\nremains. The first is seen on the left of the longer turtle-track,\r\nnear the largest bird-track; the second is on the track; the third is\r\nabove the track; the others cross the slab by fainter impressions.\r\nEach of them is composed by two feet, and each foot contains four\r\ntoes, which are seen more distinctly in some impressions than in\r\nothers. The largest of these double tracks is about three inches in\r\ndiameter. Perhaps it would be useless to speculate upon what kind of\r\nanimal they were made by. There is a similarity between these and the\r\ntracks of the Anomoepus Scambus, spoken of in the sixth group. In the\r\nlatter, however, the toes are five and three. Some experienced persons\r\nthink they are tracks of the mink, Mustela Lutreola, an animal common\r\nat the present day in these parts. This has five toes; but it may be\r\nin this as in some other digitigrades, that one of the toes in each\r\nfoot does not make an impression; or perhaps it is safer to believe,\r\ntill further investigation is made, that it was an animal of a\r\nconstruction not now existing.\r\n\r\nThe direction of these tracks presents a puzzle we are not able to\r\nunravel; it exhibits the impressions of four toes, and we have\r\nsupposed it might possess five. In either of these cases, we have no\r\nright to consider it a bird-track, but probably a reptile or a mammal.\r\nAdmitting this to be the fact, we are unable to account for the\r\ndirection of the steps, which is not alternate, as in the quadruped,\r\nbut in straight lines. In other words, this animal, supposed to have\r\nfour legs, gives us the impressions of two only, and both of these\r\nplaced together.\r\n\r\nWhen the tridactylous tracks are attentively considered, compared with\r\neach other, and with the digitated tracks, they appear to exhibit the\r\ncharacter of the impressions of the feet of birds so very decidedly,\r\nthat it would require something more than a philosophic incredulity to\r\nquestion their ornithic origin.\r\n\r\nThe other side of this slab contains interesting impressions. In the\r\nfirst place, this surface is covered with ripple-marks, each about two\r\ninches broad, extending with various degrees of distinctness across\r\nthe slab, and having an interval of an inch. The width of the ridges\r\nis greater than in any of the specimens we have seen.\r\n\r\nThis surface is almost covered by rain-drops. It has also, among other\r\nimpressions, one which has been drawn by Mr. Silsbee, our\r\nphotographist, and represented by the figure below of its proper size.\r\nThis figure, nearly four and a half inches in length, is an exact\r\nresemblance in form, but not in size, of the great Otozoum, as\r\ndepicted by President Hitchcock, and shown by the actual impression,\r\nin our hands, of the great foot, twenty inches long, and of\r\nproportionate breadth. The form of the heel, or posterior part of the\r\nfoot, is the same in the two figures; the toes are equal in both, viz.\r\nfour in number; the two internal toes correspond in their\r\narticulations, and the two external are nearly alike, with a little\r\nallowance for a different amount of adipose texture. Whether this was\r\nthe impression of an infant Otozoum, I pretend not to determine: the\r\ndrawing was taken by a gentleman who knew nothing of the Otozoum.\r\nThere are similar impressions, smaller than that last described, on\r\nthe same surface.\r\n\r\nThe stone, though now very hard and intractable, having resisted all\r\nthe chemical agents we could employ, must have remained in a soft\r\nstate for some time; for the impressions of the foot shown below\r\npenetrate to the opposite surface.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: Fossil foot impression]\r\n\r\nIn this description we have not attempted to point out all the objects\r\nworthy of interest on both sides of this curious slab. Every part\r\nof it is full of interest, and presents a field for protracted\r\nobservations. The surface represented in the plate may, by the aid of\r\na magnifier, be studied without the presence of the stone itself; for\r\nthe photographic art displays the most minute objects without\r\nalteration or omission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                         Transcriber's Notes.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of several presumed typographical error which have\r\nbeen changed as noted below, the text presented is that shown in the\r\noriginal printed version.
