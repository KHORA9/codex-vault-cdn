Add\r\nwool and silk to this and the picture becomes even more impressive.\r\nThere is not a man, woman or child who does not use one or all three\r\nof these textiles in daily life. With this in mind we submit this\r\nbrief description of how they are produced, emphasizing in particular\r\nthe development of the raw material in each case.\r\n\r\nParts I and II are practically revised editions of “Cotton and Cotton\r\nManufacture” and “Wool and Wool Manufacture” which were written by\r\nJames Paul Warburg in 1921 and 1920, respectively, and published by\r\nthe First National Bank of Boston, with whom he was then associated.\r\nWe take this occasion to acknowledge the extreme courtesy of the\r\nFirst National Bank of Boston in allowing the use of this material.\r\nPart III, dealing with Silk, has been newly compiled by Benjamin\r\nStrong, Jr., of the International Acceptance Bank, Inc.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made in these studies to enter very deeply into\r\nthe technical processes involved, the purpose being more to give a\r\ncondensed outline of the subject from the layman’s point of view.\r\nWhile actual survey and observation were extensively made in each\r\ncase, a great part of the material has of necessity been obtained\r\nfrom standard works on these subjects. In this connection we wish\r\nespecially to render acknowledgment to Professor M. T. Copeland of\r\nHarvard University, whose studies were freely used by the author of\r\nPart I on Cotton. In the case of Silk, we are particularly grateful\r\nto Mr. W. D. Darby, whose “Silk, The Queen of Fabrics” has been of\r\ninvaluable assistance. To the many friends in the textile trades who\r\nhave provided opportunities for first hand observation, as well as\r\na wealth of information, we tender our sincere thanks and grateful\r\nappreciation.\r\n\r\n  INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE BANK, INC.\r\n\r\n_New York, N.

THE COTTON PLANT\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Derivation of Names_]\r\n\r\nThe word, “Cotton”, is said to be derived from an Arabic word,\r\n“Qutun”, originally meaning flax; and the botanical name of the\r\nplant, Gossypium, signifying the fleece worn, was first found in the\r\nwritings of Pliny, and is derived from the Sanskrit. Thus, in the\r\nmere origins of the colloquial and scientific designations of the\r\nplant, we have ample proof of its antiquity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Botanical Types_]\r\n\r\nThe cotton plant belongs to the mallow family and is a native of\r\nthe tropics. The genus has a great many botanical varieties, all\r\nof which, in the wild state, are perennial, but under cultivation\r\ntend to become annual. One variety, Gossypium Arboreum, which\r\nis found chiefly in Mexico and Brazil, attains a height of over\r\nfifteen feet. This tree cotton, however, has not been extensively\r\ncultivated because of the obvious expense of picking. Of the\r\nherbaceous varieties the most commonly known are the American and the\r\nlong-staple Egyptian. G. Barbadense, known as Sea Island cotton, is\r\nanother long staple variety which is grown only in certain counties\r\nof Georgia, South Carolina and Florida.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Cotton Plant_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Fibre_]\r\n\r\nIn all the cultivated species the plant attains a height of two to\r\nfour feet. The leaves vary, but all have characteristic lobes. The\r\nblossoms also vary a good deal in color, but have this in common\r\nthat the seeds are contained in a pod or boll which is filled with\r\na floss not unlike that of the common milk-weed. In due course the\r\nboll bursts, exposing the mass of fluffy fibre from which the plant\r\nderives its extraordinary value. The superiority of cotton over other\r\nvegetable fibres, such as hemp or flax, is in the natural twist,\r\nwhich makes it inherently adaptable to spinning. The single fibre\r\nconsists of a hollow tube having transverse joints at irregular\r\nintervals, and this tube, when dry, has a tendency to flatten out\r\nand curl. The more of this natural elasticity is found in the fibre\r\nthe better it is for spinning purposes, and an immature fibre is for\r\nthis reason unsatisfactory. Cotton is exceedingly susceptible to\r\nmoisture, and a succession of violent atmospheric changes will cause\r\nsuch a rapid contraction and expansion in its fibre as to destroy its\r\nelasticity. From the point of view of the manufacturer there is very\r\nlittle difference between immature cotton and that which has suffered\r\nloss of vitality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Seeds and Stems_]\r\n\r\nBesides yielding a natural wool from which a tremendous number of\r\nproducts are derived, the seed of the plant gives forth a highly\r\nuseful vegetable oil, and the stems and leaves are used for fodder.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. HISTORY AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ancient History_]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the cultivation and commercial use of cotton is\r\nshrouded in the dim veils of antiquity. The records of India show\r\nthat the plant was grown, and its fibre utilized, from the earliest\r\ntimes. The Phoenicians and the Hebrews are known to have made cotton\r\nclothing, and later the art was transmitted by them to the Greeks and\r\nRomans. The vague annals of China indicate a familiarity with this\r\nplant and its value extending back to the remote past, and the same\r\nis true of Japan. Cortez found a flourishing textile industry among\r\nthe Aztecs in 1519, and in Peru, Pizarro found cotton garments said\r\nto antedate the civilization of the Incas. Again early Portuguese\r\nchroniclers relate the discovery of native cotton in Brazil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Europe_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _America_]\r\n\r\nThe Arabs and Saracens were largely responsible for the introduction\r\nof the textile industries to western Europe in the ninth century, but\r\nit was not until about the middle of the seventeenth century that\r\nany great progress was made. During this time the British began to\r\nattempt the cultivation of cotton in their colonies, and it was about\r\n1650 when the first Virginia plantations were begun. Since that time\r\nthe United States has forged ahead until at present it grows over\r\nthree-fifths of the world’s crop.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Egypt_]\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of cotton in Egypt was begun about 1821, American Sea\r\nIsland seeds being imported at that time. The fertile alluvial soil\r\nof the Nile delta was found particularly adapted to this use, and\r\nextensive irrigation later expanded the area. The construction of the\r\nGreat Assouan Dam late in the nineteenth century gave a tremendous\r\nimpetus to the industry. Egyptian cotton is mostly of the long staple\r\nvariety, the best, known as Sakellarides, averaging an inch and\r\nthree-quarters.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _India_]\r\n\r\nCotton culture in India is perhaps the oldest of all, but Indian\r\ncotton is of the short staple variety, and can only be used by\r\ncertain manufacturers most of which are located in Japan and Germany.\r\nAbout twenty-five million acres are said to be under cultivation, but\r\nstatistics are very meagre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _China_]\r\n\r\nChina has long been a large grower of cotton, but the native species\r\nare of a harsh, short fibre. Korea and the Yangtze and Wei basins are\r\nthe chief sources, and American cotton has recently been introduced\r\nin the southern provinces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Other Countries_]\r\n\r\nRussia began to raise American cotton on a large scale in Turkestan\r\nonly some twenty years ago, and bids fair to become a large producer.\r\nThe plant is indigenous to almost all the Central and South American\r\ncountries, and particularly in Mexico, Brazil and Peru, it has great\r\npotentialities. Peru has two kinds of native cotton known as the\r\nrough and smooth varieties. The former is of a very long and tough\r\nfibre and is valuable because it can be blended with wool.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _American Varieties_]\r\n\r\nThe greatest part of the American crop consists of the Upland\r\nvariety, although, as we have noted, there is a small but important\r\ncrop of Sea Island in the Southern Atlantic states. Another long\r\nstaple species, known as Pimas, has recently been introduced in\r\nArizona, and the alluvial soil of Mississippi, Arkansas, and\r\nLouisiana has produced still other desirable species, locally known\r\nas “Rivers,” “Peelers,” and “Benders.” Before we consider the\r\nrelative manufacturing merits of the various kinds of cotton, it\r\nwould perhaps be well to consider briefly how the crop is grown.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. CULTIVATION\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Growth of the plant_]\r\n\r\nThe cotton season of course varies in different latitudes, but the\r\nplanting is done everywhere in the early spring months. The proper\r\ncare and fertilization of the soil and its preparation to receive\r\nthe seed is of the utmost importance. The plant ripens in about four\r\nmonths, so that the picking season in this country usually begins\r\nin August, and continues until the first killing frost. From the\r\ntime of the opening of the first bolls the cotton continues to grow,\r\nunless killed by drought or insects, until the cold puts a stop to\r\nvegetation, and the same stalk frequently contains ripe and immature\r\ncotton at the same time. The cotton which matures first and has been\r\nleast exposed to weather when picked is likely to be freer of spots\r\nand discolorations than that which is picked at the end of the season.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Enemies of the plant_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Boll Weevil_]\r\n\r\nThe two great enemies of the cotton plant are drought and insect\r\ndepredations. Late frosts and the right quantity of rain and sunshine\r\nare what every cotton planter prays for, and praying is about all he\r\ncan do in this respect. Not so, however, with insects. Unfortunately\r\nthere are a great number of rapacious little creatures rendered\r\nparticularly hardy by some caprice of Nature, to whom the growing\r\ncotton plant represents an especial delicacy. Against them the\r\nplanters, under the guidance of the Department of Agriculture, are\r\nwaging continuous warfare. It is said that insect depredation, at\r\npre-war prices cost the country an annual sum of $60,000,000, more\r\nthan half of which is attributable to the two worst offenders, the\r\nboll weevil and the boll worm. Coming in hordes across the Mexican\r\nborder, the boll weevil has destroyed millions of bales of cotton\r\nannually, and as yet no very effective remedy has been found to\r\nexterminate it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Weather Defects_]\r\n\r\nEven at that, however, the planter’s greatest worry is perhaps not\r\nso much the growth as the harvesting of his crop. To get his cotton\r\npicked rapidly and properly, an operation for which no successful\r\nmachinery has yet been devised, and to have it properly ginned,\r\npresents his chief problem. If cotton is left too long on the stem it\r\nwill be exposed to the detrimental effects of the weather. Coloring\r\nmatter from the newly opened bolls, or from the soil, is washed into\r\nthe floss by the rain, and while such spots or stains may be bleached\r\nout by the sun, the lustrous bloom never returns. Frost will make\r\npermanent tinges or stains, and the wind will frequently wrap the\r\npendulous locks of fibre-covered seed about the stems of the plant or\r\ntangle them up in the leaves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Careless Picking_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bad Ginning_]\r\n\r\nWhen the pickers do not exercise proper care stem and leaves\r\nfrequently get picked along with cotton, and a considerable quantity\r\nof dirt inevitably finds its way into their bags. Or else the cotton\r\nmay be picked when it is damp, with the result that the teeth of the\r\ngin, instead of picking out the seeds and stems will cut the matted\r\nfibres, producing a class of cotton known as “Gin-cut”. Moreover the\r\ngin brushes will be unable to separate the matted tufts, and so they\r\ngo into the bale as “naps” or “neps”. All these factors militate\r\nagainst the planter in his efforts to have his crop classified as\r\nhigh as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. GRADES AND STAPLES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Grades Based on Condition_]\r\n\r\nThe classification of cotton into the standard grades fixed by\r\nthe Government constitutes an exceedingly difficult art. There is\r\nabsolutely no mechanical basis, and the classification is a purely\r\nrelative one. The kind of plant has no bearing whatsoever, nor has\r\nthe length or strength of staple. It is really a distinction based\r\nupon the condition of the cotton, rather than upon its inherent\r\nattributes.\r\n\r\nThe grade “MIDDLING” is the basis upon which the market values of the\r\nother grades are quoted. There are eight full grades:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Full Grades_]\r\n\r\n  _Fair_\r\n  _Middling Fair_\r\n  _Good Middling_\r\n  _Middling_\r\n  _Low Middling_\r\n  _Good Ordinary_\r\n  _Ordinary_\r\n  _Low Ordinary_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tinges and Stains_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_Points_”]\r\n\r\nBetween these full grades are the half grades, known as the Stricts,\r\nand some classers use quarter grades with which, however, we shall\r\nnot concern ourselves here. The grades and half-grades are quoted for\r\nwhites, tinges, and stains. A stain is a heavy discoloration while a\r\ntinge is a lighter hue, and partial discolorations, known as spots,\r\nare permissible in the lower grades of whites. The values of the\r\nvarious grades are always quoted as so many points on or off White\r\nMiddling, a point being 1/100th. of a cent. Thus, if Middling White\r\nwere quoted at 24c and Ordinary as 300 points off, it would mean\r\nthat Ordinary was worth 21c. An example is given below of a regular\r\nquotation sheet.\r\n\r\n  U. S. GRADES   [1]WHITE   [2]TINGES  [2]STAINS\r\n\r\n  Middling Fair          403 on     Nominal    Nominal\r\n  Strict Good Middling   328 on     49 off a   Nominal\r\n  Good Middling          253 on    152 off a  447 off a\r\n  Strict Middling        135 on    300 off a  618 off a\r\n  Middling                Basis    456 off a  809 off a\r\n  St. Low Middling       305 off   704 off a   Nominal\r\n  Low Middling           843 off  1064 off a   Nominal\r\n  Strict Good Ordinary  1230 off    Nominal    Nominal\r\n  Good Ordinary         1518 off    Nominal    Nominal\r\n\r\n  [1] U. S. Government differences.\r\n\r\n  [2] Average of differences on New York, New Orleans, Memphis and\r\n  either the Savannah or the Augusta exchanges.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Human Element_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Proportion of Impurities_]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in this classification the human element plays\r\na great part. The difference between quarter grades, or even half\r\ngrades, or between a tinge and a stain, are subject to a great\r\nvariety of interpretations. While there is no definite standard,\r\nMiddling must be cream or white, must show no soil evidence, no\r\ngin-cuts or naps, may have a few pieces of leaf (not powdered), and\r\na few motes, (immature seeds). As the grades go up the cotton must\r\nbe freer of impurities until the top grades have to show practically\r\na perfect lustrous, silky, white, and clear fibre. On the lower side\r\nthe impurities increase, until, in the Ordinaries, we find large and\r\nsmall leaf particles, sticks, hulls, dirt, sand naps, gin-cuts, and\r\nspots, together with a dingy color.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Some Cottons not Sold on Middling Basis_]\r\n\r\nIt is this classification that governs the trading on all the\r\nexchanges, and upon which the planter originally sells his crop. The\r\nexceptions are those varieties of cotton which are distinct from the\r\ncrop as a whole. Sea Islands are sold as Fancy, Choice, Fine, Medium,\r\nand Common. Bolly or immature cotton is sold by separate agreements;\r\nand Linters, the fibres regained by the seed mills from reginning the\r\nseed, are not sold on this basis. Neither is what is known as the\r\n“City Crop” of loose cotton accumulated from taking samples, sold in\r\nthis way.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Staple Length_]\r\n\r\nAside from grade there are two other qualifications which are of\r\nequal importance to the manufacturer: length, and strength. Lengths\r\nare quoted in eights of an inch, and cotton under 1⅛” is termed\r\nshort, while that over 1⅛” is long. The normal lengths run from ¾”\r\nto 1⅞”, and it is noteworthy that, where a normal difference between\r\ngrades would be 25 points, the difference of ⅛” would be about 250\r\npoints. “Pulling” for staple is another art where the individual’s\r\njudgment plays an important part.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Elasticity_]\r\n\r\nStrength,—elasticity and tensile strength,—is again one of the mill’s\r\nprerequisites. The usual buyer’s test for fibre vitality is to\r\ncompress a sample in the hand to see if it will return to its former\r\nshape. The importance of length is that it governs the fineness of\r\nthe yarn to be spun, while grades affect the finish of the cloth.\r\nWe shall see later that mills cannot buy mixed lots, but must have\r\neven-running grades of fixed staple.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. BUYERS OF RAW COTTON\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Storekeepers as Local Buyers_]\r\n\r\nThe small planters of the South are usually unable to finance\r\nthemselves independently through the growing and picking seasons.\r\nConsequently the local store-keeper, from whom the planters buy their\r\nsupplies, usually extends credit in the form of an open account and\r\nso becomes the first middleman. Not infrequently the store-keeper\r\nwill accept cotton rather than money in settlement of his accounts,\r\nand where he follows this practice he becomes what is known as a\r\nlocal buyer. When he has accumulated sufficient cotton he sells\r\neither to an intermediate buyer, or to the buyer for some merchant or\r\nmill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Large Growers_]\r\n\r\nIn the case of the larger grower, or the syndicate of growers, the\r\nlocal buyer is usually eliminated. These planters obtain their credit\r\nfrom the large merchant buyers, who in turn are carried by their\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Intermediate Buyers_]\r\n\r\nVery frequently the local buyers are scattered so thickly through\r\na neighborhood, and each accumulate such small and heterogeneous\r\nlots of cotton that an intermediate buyer finds his way into the\r\nnatural order. Sometimes the intermediate is merely a “scalper” who\r\nbuys from the local dealer and sells to merchant buyers. In other\r\ncases, notably in Texas, he acts as a concentrating agent, buying at\r\nlocal points from growers and selling, usually at compress points,\r\nto representatives of merchants or mills. In the latter case he is\r\nreferred to as a “street buyer.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Financing Early Stages_]\r\n\r\nWhere the grower surrenders his cotton to the local dealer the latter\r\nusually has it ginned, but in cases where the planter is able to\r\nfinance himself he takes his cotton to the gin himself, pays for the\r\nginning, and either sells in so-called gin bales, (before they are\r\ncompressed) or, if a warehouse is available at the gin or compress\r\npoint, holds his cotton until he can obtain a satisfactory price\r\nfor it. The local banks perform a very important part of the crop\r\nfinancing at this stage, for, since the grower sells for cash, the\r\nbuyers require advances. These are made by the Southern banks against\r\nbuyers’ tickets, showing cotton purchased, against gin receipts,\r\nwarehouse receipts, compress receipts, and finally when the cotton is\r\nshipped, against bills of lading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Square Bale_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Merchant Buyer’s Importance_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Take-up Man_]\r\n\r\nThe large cotton merchants fulfill a very essential function in\r\nthat they are responsible for the concentration of the raw material\r\nand for its redistribution into the proper channels of manufacture.\r\nThey maintain branches and representatives throughout the entire\r\ncotton growing areas and are directly connected by wire with all the\r\nimportant exchanges. By far the bulk of their buying is done after\r\nthe close of the New York Exchange from local and intermediate buyers\r\nwho during the day have been acquiring mixed lots of all sorts.\r\nThe merchant’s representative, known as the take-up man, goes over\r\nand classifies the cotton accumulated by the local buyers, takes a\r\nsample from each bale which he tags with a duplicate of the shipping\r\ntag he places on the bale itself, and then ships the cotton to the\r\nconcentration point and the samples to the office at that place. He\r\npays the local buyer by draft or check.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Even-running Lots from Compress Point_]\r\n\r\nThe office at the concentration point, usually where there is a\r\ncompress, has in the meantime received instructions from the head\r\noffice as to how to make up the various lots. As the bales are\r\ncompressed they are collected into even-running lots of certain\r\ngrades for which the head office has received inquiries from\r\nmills, and are shipped out in this way. The branch office will\r\nship according to instructions forwarding the bills of lading with\r\ninvoices and sight drafts to the head office or to some bank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cooperative Marketing_]\r\n\r\nSince the war, and particularly in the last three years, the\r\nco-operative movement has in some sections developed to such an\r\nextent as to supplant in large part the old system of marketing.\r\nIn Texas, Georgia, and other States, a large part of the crop\r\nis now concentrated, financed, and sold through these extensive\r\norganizations of growers either direct to mills, or to large\r\nmerchants and exporters.\r\n\r\nAlmost all cotton is bought on Middling Basis, but some is taken\r\non sample with guarantees, (often a dangerous practice for both\r\nparties), and some is taken at a fixed price per bale.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Direct Buying_]\r\n\r\nA few Southern mills buy direct from nearby growers, but the\r\npreponderant majority and practically all the Northern mills obtain\r\ntheir cotton through merchants, or through brokers representing\r\nSouthern merchants.\r\n\r\nWe have seen briefly how the cotton is grown and brought to market,\r\nbut we have still to consider the all important question of what\r\ndetermines the price at which it changes hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. THE COTTON EXCHANGES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _“Spot” and “Futures”_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Great Markets_]\r\n\r\nCotton trading falls roughly into two categories: trading in cotton\r\nfor immediate delivery, or spot cotton; and buying or selling for\r\ndelivery at some future time. Purchases or sales of spot cotton mean\r\nthat cotton actually will be delivered from vendor to purchaser, but,\r\nas we shall see, trading in futures does not necessarily mean that\r\nthe contract will be fulfilled by delivery. The great cotton markets\r\nare New York, Liverpool, New Orleans, Bremen, and Havre. Of these\r\nNew York is almost entirely a futures market, while New Orleans is\r\nchiefly a spot market. Liverpool, Bremen, and Havre trade in both\r\nspot and futures, but Liverpool is the European centre for trading in\r\nfuture contracts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The New York Cotton Exchange_]\r\n\r\nOnly about 2% of the annual crop is sold spot in New York, and yet\r\nit is the prices on the New York Cotton Exchange which govern very\r\nlargely the price paid to the grower in the South by the various\r\nbuyers. The New York Exchange is the barometer of the American, and\r\nto a large extent, of the world’s cotton trade, because its mechanism\r\nworks out the equilibrium between demand and supply; and as this\r\nmechanism consists chiefly of the trading device called the “Hedge”,\r\nwe shall digress for a moment to consider its operation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The “Hedge”_]\r\n\r\nWe might say that hedging is an insurance against fluctuations in\r\ncotton prices by purchase or sale of future contracts for cotton\r\nagainst sale or purchase made for actual delivery. It consists of\r\nnothing more than of neutralizing the gain or loss which will result\r\nfrom existing delivery contracts if the price rises or falls before\r\ndelivery date, by creating an off-setting loss or gain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _As Used by the Merchant_]\r\n\r\nAssume, for instance, that a merchant makes a contract with a mill in\r\nJuly for 100 bales October delivery. He sells at the current price of\r\nlet us say 30 cents per pound plus his overhead and profit. In due\r\ncourse he will obtain his cotton from the South, but in the meantime\r\nhe covers, or hedges his contract by buying 100 bales of October\r\nfutures on the Exchange. If he has to pay the grower 31 cents for the\r\ncotton which he has sold to the mill for 30 cents, he will on the\r\nother hand, be able to sell his future contract which he bought at\r\n30 cents for 31 cents, so that the loss on one is neutralized by the\r\ngain on the other. Vice versa, he will lose whatever _extra_ profit\r\nhe might have made from a falling price.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _By the Manufacturer_]\r\n\r\nIn the same way a manufacturer may buy futures against orders he\r\nhas accepted for goods, based on the price he expects to pay for\r\nhis cotton. Or he may sell futures to protect himself on cotton he\r\nhas bought but has not yet covered by cloth contracts. Hedging by\r\nmanufacturers, however, particularly in the North, is not a common\r\npractice, because the cloth market is not elastic enough to follow\r\naccurately in the wake of cotton prices, and also because the mill\r\ntreasurer rarely wants to hedge cotton in his warehouse, preferring\r\nto rely on his own judgment in matters of purchase.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _By the Grower_]\r\n\r\nOccasionally a grower may find it to his advantage to hedge his crop.\r\nIf, for example, he is satisfied in August that the present price\r\nfor December is likely to be higher than he will obtain later, he\r\nmay sell December futures for a conservative percentage of his crop,\r\nthereby guaranteeing himself against a drop.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Speculation_]\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest part of the future trading, however, is done\r\nby merchants, because they are actually engaged in the business\r\nof selling cotton which they have not yet acquired or of carrying\r\ncotton for which they have no contracts. Speculation, of course,\r\nenters into the dealings on the exchanges as an important economic\r\nfactor, in normal times tending to stabilize by discounting future\r\ntrends, but in periods of extraordinary demand or supply frequently\r\ncausing violent fluctuations in prices. At such times there is\r\nalways a good deal of agitation for preventive legislation, but it is\r\nunlikely that dealing in futures will ever be prohibited by law. The\r\npresent regulations of the large exchanges eliminate abuse as far as\r\npossible, and the futures markets are really a factor of safety for\r\nthe entire industry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Dissemination of Quotations_]\r\n\r\nAll the large merchants, as we have seen, have branch offices in the\r\nSouth, and all these offices have wire connections with the chief\r\nmarkets. On the basis of the Liverpool quotations and the New York\r\nopening prices the head offices will send out to their branches and\r\nrepresentatives their daily limits, above which they are instructed\r\nnot to buy. Inasmuch as most of the small growers are dependent for\r\ntheir news of the markets upon the buyers, they are at somewhat\r\nof a disadvantage, but the keenness of competition prevents their\r\nexploitation by unscrupulous buyers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _New York Cotton Contract_]\r\n\r\nA contract on the New York Cotton Exchange calling for the delivery\r\nof 100 bales specifies Middling grade, but the seller may deliver\r\nany grades which are tenderable by the Exchange regulations. These\r\ngrades are from Strict Low Middling to Middling Fair, but if tinged,\r\nnot below Middling Tinged. Stains are not tenderable. The grades are\r\ndetermined and settlement made on the basis of so many points on or\r\noff Middling, which, as we have seen, is the basis for all quotations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Buying Season_]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that mills, which require certain even-running grades,\r\ncould of course never buy their cotton on the Middling basis. For\r\nthis reason, except in the few cases where they buy direct from\r\nthe growers, mills purchase their requirements from dealers on the\r\nbasis of samples. Selling to mills, as opposed to selling M/B, is\r\nknown as selling on merit. Mills usually begin to buy in September\r\nand fill about 60% of their year’s requirements by January. Those\r\nmanufacturers who use the high grades usually buy earliest because of\r\nthe limited crop from which they must obtain their share. Cotton is\r\nordinarily shipped soon after purchase and stored not by the merchant\r\nbut at the mill. The recent growth of Southern warehouse companies,\r\nhowever, has caused mills to carry less cotton than formerly. Mills\r\nordinarily pay for their cotton in three days.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced rapidly how the cotton is grown and marketed,\r\nand our next concern will be to follow what happens to it during\r\nthe process of making it into goods. Deferring for the moment\r\nconsideration of cotton export from the United States, we shall\r\nproceed in Chapter Two, to glance at the various aspects of Cotton\r\nManufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF COTTON\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HISTORY IN THE U. S.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on the subject of the textile industry and\r\nperhaps even more still remains to be said. It is not the object of\r\nthis brief survey to present a complete picture of all the stages\r\nof manufacture, but rather to place briefly before the reader a\r\nnecessarily kaleidoscopic view of the various processes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Slater’s Mills_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Whitney’s Gin_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Stimulus of War of 1812_]\r\n\r\nAlthough the first cotton mill in the United States was founded in\r\nRhode Island by Samuel Slater in 1790, Whitney’s invention of the\r\ncotton gin in 1793 marked the real beginning of the cotton growing\r\nand manufacturing industries in this country, because it solved the\r\nhitherto vexatious problem of separating the fibre from the seed.\r\nNevertheless, until the war of 1812, this country exported almost all\r\nof its cotton to Great Britain, and imported from there its cotton\r\ngoods. The war stimulated the textile industry for two reasons:\r\nfirst, because no British goods were available; and second, because\r\nit brought about the transference of New England capital from ships\r\nand commerce to home manufacturing industries. The census figures for\r\n1805 show 4,500 spindles in the country; in 1825 there were 800,000.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Growth to 1860_]\r\n\r\nVarious inventions, notably Lowell’s power loom in 1814, and\r\nJenck’s ring spindle in 1830, made it possible for the New England\r\nmanufacturer to compete with the skilled labor of England, and up\r\nto the time of the Civil War the industry made rapid strides. In\r\n1831 795 establishments with 1,200,000 spindles used 77,800,000\r\npounds of cotton and manufactured $32,000,000 worth of goods. Thirty\r\nyears later there were 1091 mills with 5,200,000 spindles using\r\n422,700,000 pounds of cotton and making a product worth $115,700,000.\r\nAt this time 570 of the mills were in New England, 340 in the Middle\r\nAtlantic States, 159 in the South, and 22 in the Western States. The\r\nNew England mills, however, averaged twice as many spindles as the\r\nothers, and Massachusetts and Rhode Island alone contained 48% of the\r\ntotal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Civil War_]\r\n\r\nHome industries at this time supplied most of the coarse drills and\r\nsheetings, while the fine goods were imported from England. There was\r\na small export trade of coarse goods to Asia. The Civil War cut off\r\nthe industrial centers from their raw material so that for five years\r\nno progress was made, and when normal life was resumed a new tendency\r\ntowards concentration became manifest. From then on the number of\r\nplants decreased and the individual establishment grew larger, so\r\nthat in 1880 there were fewer mills and four and one-half times as\r\nmany spindles as twenty years before.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Rapid Industrial Rise of the South_]\r\n\r\nWhile we shall discuss the geographical distribution of the industry\r\nin a later chapter, it is worthy of note here that the feature of\r\nthe period beginning about 1880 and extending to the present time,\r\nwas the gradual growth of the spinning and weaving industry in the\r\nSouth. The social and economic system in the Southern states before\r\nthe abolition of slavery made those states entirely agrarian, but\r\nas soon as a recovery from the war was accomplished, manufacturing,\r\nand particularly cotton manufacturing, grew up surprisingly fast.\r\nA glance at the growth in spindlage in the United States from 1880\r\nto 1923 will suffice to illustrate. Sixty per cent. of the increase\r\nsince 1880 was in the South. The units represent millions of spindles.\r\n\r\n           1880   1890   1900   1910   1923   Inc. 43 yrs.\r\n  North    10.1   12.6   14.5   17.4   19.9     9.8\r\n  South      .5    1.7    4.5   11.2   16.3    15.8\r\n\r\n\r\n2. MAKING COTTON YARN\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Bale_]\r\n\r\nAlmost all cotton comes to the mill in standard compress bales of\r\nfive hundred pounds gross. The cotton is condensed to about 22 pounds\r\nper cubic foot at the compress, wrapped in coarse jute bagging, and\r\ncircled with iron hoops. For some time there has been a movement to\r\nimprove the so-called square bale, or to replace it with a different\r\nform of packing. Sea Island cotton is frequently packed in a smaller\r\nround bale, and there is much to be said for this practice. What\r\nwe are concerned with here, however, is that the mill receives the\r\ncotton in a compressed form which must be loosened before anything\r\ncan be done with it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE BALE-BREAKER]\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the first thing that happens is that the hoops are\r\ncut, the bagging removed, and the cotton thrown by hand into the\r\nfeed-apron of the bale-breaker. This machine does nothing more than\r\nto pick the compressed cotton apart and deliver it in tufts about the\r\nsize of a handfull on a belt conveyor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Opener_]\r\n\r\nThe travelling belt or feeder delivers these bunches of cotton into\r\nmachines called Openers, which simply repeat the operation of the\r\nbale-breaker on a more thorough scale, reducing the large tufts into\r\nmany smaller ones. These small pieces are dropped into an air chute\r\nand drawn along parallel rods up to the picker room. During transit\r\nin the trunk much of the heavier dirt falls between the rods and is\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent installations larger bale-breakers are used which\r\nreduce the cotton to small tufts and deliver through an air pipe to\r\na condenser in the picker-room. The condenser either empties into\r\nbins or else on to the automatic feed of the breaker-pickers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bale Breakers_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Pickers Remove Coarse Dirt_]\r\n\r\nAs the tufts come out of the chute they fall into the first of three\r\nmachines known as Pickers, whose function is to beat out the coarser\r\nimpurities and deliver the cotton in rolls of batting called laps.\r\nIn the first, or breaker-picker the tufts are thoroughly whirled\r\nand pounded over grid-bars by rollers armed with short flail-like\r\nprojections, and then compressed into a continuous sheet or lap of a\r\ngiven weight per yard, which is wound on a large spool and delivered\r\nto the second, or intermediate picker. This machine practically\r\nrepeats the operation only that it combines four laps from the first\r\npicker into one which it hands over to the last, or finisher picker.\r\nThe latter again takes four intermediate laps and forms them into\r\none sheet of fairly clean cotton, containing very little dirt or\r\nseed, but still fairly filled with small particles of leaf. In these\r\npreliminary operations the cotton has lost about five per cent. of\r\nits weight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Picker Room_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Function of the Card_]\r\n\r\nBefore anything else can be done it is now necessary to remove the\r\nleaf particles, and to separate the individual fibres from their\r\nmatted position. Both these functions are performed by the machine\r\nknown as the Card, the principle of which is that of two surfaces\r\narmed with fine wire teeth revolving not quite tangent to each\r\nother. Originally carding was performed by hand, but the Wellman\r\ncarding machine was one of the earliest textile inventions. This\r\nwas considerably improved by the revolving flat card in 1857, the\r\noperation of which is somewhat as follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCIPLE OF THE FLAT CARD]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Its Operation_]\r\n\r\nThe lap from the finisher picker is fed over a plate on to a\r\nrevolving cylinder bearing wire teeth, which combs it over a set of\r\nknives, thereby removing coarse dirt, and passes it on to a large\r\ncylinder armed with millions of fine wire teeth. The latter carries\r\nthe cotton past a slowly revolving endless chain of flats which\r\nremove the neps and fine dirt. The clean, separated fibres are then\r\npicked off the cylinder by a smaller rapidly revolving roller called\r\nthe doffer, which carries them in a filmy sheet to be in turn removed\r\nby the doffing comb. The latter, working so rapidly that the eye\r\nfails to see it, lifts the sheet of fibres clear so that it may be\r\npassed through a funnel and condensed into a single untwisted rope a\r\nlittle under an inch in diameter. This rope is called a sliver, and\r\nis automatically coiled into a can like an umbrella-stand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Counts of Yarn_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Two Processes_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Feed End of Card. Lap Entering_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Delivery of Sliver_]\r\n\r\nWe have now for the first time reduced the raw material to a\r\ncontinuous strand, comparatively free from impurities. Up to this\r\npoint, no matter what kind of yarn is to be spun, the operations\r\nare practically identical, but from here on the processes vary\r\naccording to the product desired. A hank of yarn is 840 yards (not\r\nto be confused with the worsted hank of 560 yards) and the number\r\nof hanks it takes to make a pound is the basis upon which yarn is\r\nclassified. Thus a coarse yarn which weighs only twenty hanks to the\r\npound, would be called 20s, while 80s would be a very fine yarn.\r\nVarious fabrics require different grades of yarn, just as different\r\nfinenesses of yarn must be spun from varying grades of cotton. The\r\nprocesses preparatory to spinning vary, not only with the counts to\r\nbe spun, but with the use to which the yarn is to be put. Ordinary\r\ncoarse and medium yarns for weaving usually follow one process, while\r\nfine counts for weaving, or knitting yarn, or coarse yarn made from\r\nlong-staple cotton such as that used for tire-duck, go through a\r\ndifferent preparation. The former are simply drawn and reduced, while\r\nthe latter are in addition combed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _First Process_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Drawing_]\r\n\r\nIn the ordinary process, which is by far the most commonly used, the\r\nsliver from the card is put through successive similar operations,\r\nknown as drawing, the object of which is to draw out the fibres\r\nand cause them to lie parallel to each other. Six card slivers are\r\nfed together between two pairs of rollers, the second of which is\r\nrevolving faster than the first. The obvious result of this is the\r\nstretching of that portion of the slivers which is between the two\r\nsets of rollers. The operation is usually performed two or three\r\ntimes, in each case combining six strands into one. The sliver\r\ndelivered by the third drawing machine will be of the same diameter\r\nas the original card sliver, but will contain more or less parallel\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Roving Frame_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Roving Operations_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Slubber_]\r\n\r\nThere remains now only one series of operations before the yarn\r\nis ready to be spun. The sliver must be reduced in size and given\r\na certain amount of twist; these objects are accomplished by the\r\nroving frames, of which there are either three or four. The first, or\r\nslubber, passes the drawn sliver through rollers without combining,\r\nand winds it up on bobbins set in spindles. The sliver is twisted\r\nby being fed onto the bobbin by an arm, or flyer, which revolves a\r\nlittle more slowly than the spindle, being drawn around after it. The\r\nresult is a slightly twisted sliver, now called a roving, about the\r\ndiameter of a clothes-line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Four Stages of Roving_]\r\n\r\nThe intermediate, fine frame, and jack frame,—or, if there are only\r\nthree roving boxes, the intermediate and fine frames,—combine two\r\nrovings into one of smaller size and more twist. The mechanism is\r\nmuch the same, except that in each successive frame the spindles are\r\nsmaller and revolve faster, until finally the thread is small enough\r\nto spin.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Second Process_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lapper_]\r\n\r\nWhere it is desired to spin special kinds or very fine yarns twenty\r\ncard slivers are usually combined in a machine similar to a drawing\r\nframe and known as a sliver-lapper. The twenty ends are drawn between\r\nrollers and delivered not as we should expect in one strand, but in\r\na narrow band or lap, which is wound on spools. Four of these laps\r\nare again combined and drawn over a spiral surface in the ribbon\r\nlapper which delivers its product to the comb. The cotton is now in\r\na band less than a foot wide, with fibres more or less parallel and\r\npractically clean. Since it is desired to spin a yarn which demands\r\nnot only parallel but uniform fibres, the short fibres must be\r\neliminated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Comb_]\r\n\r\nThere are a considerable number of combing machines in use at the\r\npresent time, but their differences are mechanical rather than in the\r\nfunction they perform. The Heilmann principle is the most commonly\r\nused in this country. Eight rolls from the ribbon-lapper are placed\r\nin separate rests, or heads, end to end, and each lap is fed through\r\nrollers between teeth of a very fine and rapidly oscillating steel\r\ncomb. Every back and forth motion, known as a nip, delivers about\r\nhalf an inch of filmy sheet from which the short fibres have been\r\ncombed out. The eight combed sheets are then once more condensed into\r\na single sliver and coiled into a cylindrical can.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Drawing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Doublings_]\r\n\r\nFollowing the comb there are usually two drawing frames, each\r\ncombining six slivers into one, and these are followed by the three\r\nor four roving frames as in the other process. In the ordinary\r\nprocess the last roving as it leaves the jack frame has been doubled\r\n27,648 times; in the combed yarn there are 2,959,120 doublings before\r\nspinning begins.\r\n\r\nSpinning proper is done either on the mule or the ring spindle. Very\r\nlittle cotton is spun on mules in this country, although mules are\r\nextensively used in Europe. We shall concern ourselves here only with\r\nthe ring spindle, and that in bare outline. (See also Part Two, Page\r\n83).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Ring Frame_]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the ring frame is very similar to that of the roving\r\noperations which immediately precede it. The thread is again drawn\r\nthrough two or three sets of rollers running at successively higher\r\nrates of speed, and then passes as shown on the accompanying sketch\r\nthrough a guide to a small metal loop, called the traveller, which\r\nruns around on a metal track or ring within which the spindle with\r\nits bobbin is revolving. Since the spindle pulls the traveller around\r\nafter it, the yarn is twisted or spun as it is wound on the bobbin.\r\nSometimes two spools of roving are spun into a single thread, but\r\nmore frequently there is no combination. All the rings on one frame,\r\nusually about 256, are moved up and down together on their spindles,\r\nso that yarn will be wound evenly on the bobbin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ring Twister_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RING FRAME PRINCIPLE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Yarn of Filling Bobbin, Warp Bobbin, and Spool_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Warp and Filling Bobbins_]\r\n\r\nNot only is a different bobbin used for spinning warp and filling\r\nyarns, but they are also wound differently on the bobbin. Warp yarn\r\nis wound evenly up and down the whole length of the bobbin, while the\r\nfilling bobbins, which go straight from the spindle into the shuttle\r\nof the loom, are wound on in sections to facilitate rapid unwinding.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Twisting_]\r\n\r\nWe have now proceeded as far as the finished yarn. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, when a particularly strong thread is desired, or in case\r\nof fancy designs, it is desirable to twist two or more threads\r\nof yarn together, this being known as two-ply, three-ply, etc.\r\nVarious effects are obtained by twisting different yarns together,\r\nand sometimes worsted and cotton strands are twisted together. The\r\noperation is done on a frame similar to the spinning frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Barber Knotter_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Barber Knotter_]\r\n\r\nIn these and subsequent operations the Barber Knotter, a little\r\ndevice worn on the hand of the operative, has enormously increased\r\nefficiency. By a single motion an entirely unskilled girl can knot\r\nand cut off evenly the ends of two threads.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. WEAVING GRAY GOODS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Principle of Weaving_]\r\n\r\nThe modern power loom represents one of the most remarkable\r\nachievements of industrial development. Into its perfection have gone\r\nthe inventions and improvements of centuries, and volumes could, and\r\nhave been written on the subject of modern weaving. Nevertheless, the\r\nold-fashioned hand-loom has not yet gone out of existence, and still\r\nfinds its use in the development of new designs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Spooling_]\r\n\r\nWeaving is, of course, the process whereby yarn is made into cloth,\r\nand its fundamental principle is that of the warp and weft structure.\r\nIn its simplest form this means that a series of threads are\r\nstretched parallel to each other, thereby forming a warp. A second\r\nthread, called the weft, is then passed over the odd and under the\r\neven warp threads, and back again under the odd and over the even.\r\nIn this way a cloth fabric will gradually be built up. In most cases\r\nthe process has become considerably more complicated than this, but\r\nthere are even now certain materials, such as calico, which retain\r\nthe elementary weave. The actual weaving, that is, the passing of the\r\nshuttle carrying the weft thread over and under the warp threads, has\r\nnow been reduced to an entirely automatic process, even with the most\r\ncomplicated designs, but the preparatory work still entails a large\r\nproportion of hand labor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Creels_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spooling_]\r\n\r\nThe first operation consists of winding the yarn from the bobbin on\r\nto spools, each containing the same length of yarn. This must be done\r\nwith care or considerable waste will result.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Creel_]\r\n\r\nThe next step is to place these spools in a rack or creel where they\r\nfit on glass bearings so that they may be arranged in the proper\r\norder and run through the warper on to the section beam. The latter\r\nis a large roller several of which are combined to form a beam. The\r\nbeam is the name given to the roller which is placed in the loom to\r\ndeliver the warp threads.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sizing_]\r\n\r\nIn order both to strengthen the warp threads and to make them\r\nsmoother for weaving it is usual to apply some starchy or glutinous\r\nsubstance to them. This operation, which is performed in a machine\r\ncalled the Slasher, is termed yarn sizing, and consists of running\r\nthe threads through a bath of preparation and then drying them\r\nquickly on a large steam-filled drum or can. One slasher will do\r\nenough work for 200 to 500 looms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Slasher_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Healding_]\r\n\r\nSince it is necessary that the warp threads may be lowered or raised\r\nin various combinations to allow the passage of the shuttle, each\r\nwarp thread must be passed through an eye in the centre of a harness\r\nwire. Where, for instance, the warp is to be raised and depressed in\r\nthree even sections there will be three harness frames, each fitted\r\nwith enough heald-wires to accommodate one-third of the number of\r\nthreads in the entire warp. In the Jacquard loom, used for intricate\r\npatterns, each warp-thread is separately controlled. The passing of\r\nthe ends of the warp through their proper harness wires is a delicate\r\nand skilfull operation known as healding, or drawing-in. At the same\r\ntime that this is done the threads are passed through individual\r\nstop-motion wires, relaxed tension on any one of which will bring the\r\nloom to a stop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawing In_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Reeding_]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with drawing-in, is the final step in the\r\npreparation of the warp, and this is called reeding or sleying. In\r\norder to keep the warp threads in proper position during weaving\r\nthey are passed through the wires of what looks like a comb with a\r\nstrip across the open ends. This, the sley or reed, is attached to\r\nthe batten on the loom and serves in addition to drive home each weft\r\nthread after the shuttle has passed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Warp Tieing_]\r\n\r\nWhen the loom has devoured all the warp threads contained on one\r\nbeam, all that is necessary, if the pattern is to be continued, is\r\nto tie the ends of the old warp to the ends of the new, and this is\r\naccomplished with marvelous accuracy by a little machine built on the\r\nsame principle as the Barber Knotter. This avoids drawing-in a second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Weaving Shed of Power Looms_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Power Loom_]\r\n\r\nWhen the preparatory processes have been completed the actual weaving\r\nis done, practically without human agency. The shuttle flies back\r\nand forth at the rate of from one to two hundred picks per minute,\r\nand when its thread is exhausted it drops out and, in the automatic\r\nloom, is immediately supplanted by a fresh one. The harness frames\r\njerk up and down, forming and reforming the V shaped shed through\r\nwhich the shuttle passes; and after each pick the batten drives home\r\nthe new thread into the ever-growing stretch of cloth. Like the film\r\nin a kodak, where a roller at one end gives out plain paper which is\r\nrolled up at the other end as a magic sheet of pictures, so in the\r\nloom the homely warp threads are rolled out at one end, while the\r\nroller at the other extreme winds up smooth gray cloth.\r\n\r\nWe have now made yarn out of cotton, and unbleached cotton cloth, or\r\ngray goods, out of our yarn. All that remains before the fabric goes\r\nto the finisher is an inspection for imperfections and their removal\r\nwhere possible, usually by hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. CONVERTING AND FINISHING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Old-Fashioned Bleaching_]\r\n\r\nCotton cloth as it comes from the loom has a gray or yellowish\r\nappearance due to the impurities it contains. The old-fashioned\r\nmethod of removing these consists in simply spreading the cloth in\r\nthe sun for a few days until it is bleached white. Most cloth mills\r\ndispose of their goods in the gray and allow the finishing to be done\r\nby a separate establishment, although the large manufacturers of\r\n“fancies” sometimes do their own finishing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sewing Together_]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the finishing plant is to inspect the cloth and\r\nthen to sew the ends of many pieces together into long strips. This\r\ngreatly facilitates subsequent operations, because the cloth can now\r\nbe run through various processes as a single unit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Brushing_]\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a smooth surface for later processes, the cloth\r\nis first run through a machine which brushes up the fibres and loose\r\nends, much as a carpet-sweeper picks up the fibres of a carpet.\r\nSometimes a bladed roller like a lawn-mower is used.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Singeing_]\r\n\r\nRemoving the raised lint is a dangerous operation because it might\r\neasily damage the cloth, and this is usually done by the process of\r\nsingeing. The cloth is run rapidly through gas flames or over hot\r\nplates and is quickly cooled. In this way the fuzz is burned off\r\nwithout injuring the cloth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Napping_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Inspecting_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sewing Ends Together_]\r\n\r\nThe next step is usually the bleaching process, except where the\r\ncloth is to be finished as a corduroy, velvet, or flannel. In the\r\nlatter case it is first run through the napper, a machine which\r\nbrushes up the fibre with wire teeth in such a way as to leave a\r\nraised face or nap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Singeing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bleaching Process_]\r\n\r\nBleaching is accomplished by boiling the cloth for several hours in\r\nlarge iron tanks known as kiers, which contain a solution of caustic\r\nsoda. Next it is washed and scoured in dilute acid for several hours\r\nwith the object of removing iron stains. Then it is again washed,\r\nboiled a second time, washed, run through a chemical solution of\r\nbleaching powder, and allowed to steep. After a last washing the\r\ncloth is dried by running over copper drums filled with steam, and is\r\nthen rolled up in bundles about the size of a barrel.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _White Goods_]\r\n\r\nIf the cloth is to be finished as plain white goods it is next\r\nstarched and ironed (calendared), inspected, and put up in bolts for\r\nshipment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mercerization_]\r\n\r\nIf, however, it is desired either to dye or print the cloth with\r\nvarious colors and designs, it still has several treatments to pass\r\nthrough. White goods are sometimes mercerized, but more commonly this\r\nprocess is employed with cloth that is to be dyed. Mercerization is\r\nthe treating of cotton yarn or cloth to the action of caustic soda\r\ndissolved in water, the remaining soda being removed by a wash of\r\ndilute sulphuric acid. The result is an increased strength of fibre,\r\nloss of elasticity, silky appearance, and an affinity for certain\r\ndyes and mordants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Napping_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dyeing_]\r\n\r\nThe subject of dyeing is one of intense interest and wide scope, but\r\nit is unfortunately beyond the field of this brief survey. Suffice\r\nit to say that various chemical processes and mechanical devices are\r\nemployed to give a permanent color to the cloth. (Yarn and raw stock\r\ndyeing are less commonly employed in the cotton than in the woolen\r\nand worsted industries.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Resist and Discharge Printing_]\r\n\r\nSome cotton cloth is simply dyed with a solid color and finished,\r\nbut frequently it is first dyed with one color and then printed with\r\nothers, or with a chemical which will discharge the dye and leave\r\nwhite figures wherever it touches the cloth. In contrast to this\r\ndischarge method, where it is desired to obtain white figures on a\r\ncolored back-ground, it is also possible first to print the figures\r\nwith a chemical that will resist the subsequent action of the\r\ndye-stuff. Where a white ground is used and it is not essential that\r\nthe colors and design appear on both sides of the cloth it is not\r\nnecessary to dye at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bleaching Kiers_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Printing Process_]\r\n\r\nThe printing process is a very old one, and was employed centuries\r\nago in China and India, where natives used to impregnate cloth with\r\ncolored designs by pounding small wooden blocks carved and filled\r\nwith color on its surface. The modern printing machine has a series\r\nof copper rollers in which the design to be printed is etched or\r\nsunk. Under each roller where it is fixed in the printing press is a\r\ntrough filled with the particular coloring matter which that roller\r\nis to print on the cloth. As the mechanism revolves the roller is\r\nconstantly supplied with new color, which is scraped off its surface\r\nexcept where the sunken design holds it, by a knife, called the\r\ndoctor. If the design calls for six colors there will be six rollers\r\nat work, and so on up to fourteen colors at a single run through the\r\npress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Engraving_]\r\n\r\nAn infinite number of designs are printed, and the method of getting\r\nthem etched on the copper roller is a fascinating one. A zinc plate\r\nis carved by hand on a greatly enlarged scale from the original\r\nsketch, and from this plate the girls who operate the pantograph\r\nmachines transfer the outlines of each color on to the copper rollers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Printing Machine_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Pantograph_]\r\n\r\nWhen the roller is placed in the pantograph it is coated with\r\nvarnish. As the girl traces the outlines of the design on her zinc\r\nplate with a little pointer, she presses a treddle which brings a\r\nnumber of little diamond points in contact with the roller. Each one\r\nof these points cuts through the varnish, reproducing the design in\r\nits original size. There will be as many points as the number of\r\ntimes the design is repeated across the roller. When the roller is\r\nfinished it is given a bath in nitric acid which will eat into the\r\ncopper where the varnish has been cut away, thus sinking the design\r\nso that it will hold color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Battery of Forty-eight_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Aging and Washing_]\r\n\r\nThere remain now only the finishing operations before the cloth is\r\nready to be packed for the market. Usually, after printing, the cloth\r\nis steamed, or aged, to make the colors fast. Then it is fixed and\r\nsoaped thoroughly, after which it is run through the drier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Starching_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Tenter_]\r\n\r\nIn order to give the cloth the proper “feel” an operation is next\r\nperformed which closely resembles warp sizing. A certain amount of\r\nhot starch is pressed into the cloth, after which it is drawn through\r\nthe tenter frames and not only dried but stretched back to its normal\r\nwidth. The tenter frame is about one hundred feet long and contains\r\nlong lines of steam pipes. On each side an endless chain with clips\r\ngrips the cloth and moving gradually further apart, these chains\r\nstretch the cloth, delivering it dry and of even width. (Some goods,\r\nnotably those made for Asiatic consumption in England, are not only\r\nstarched but filled with China clay, which adds over 100% to their\r\nweight.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Engraving Plate_]\r\n\r\nAs it comes off the tenter the cloth goes through steel rollers and\r\nis pressed smooth, after which it is automatically folded and made\r\nready for ticketing and packing.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. THE KNITTING INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _History_]\r\n\r\nWe have just seen by what processes cotton yarn becomes first gray\r\ncloth, and then finished goods. There is of course a tremendous\r\nvariety of woven fabric, ranging all the way from the coarsest sail\r\ncloth to the finest organdie. And there are certain finishes such as\r\nvelveteen and corduroy which, for want of space, we have not even\r\ntouched upon. There is, however, a whole class of cotton fabric which\r\nis not woven but knit; and since most of our hosiery and underwear\r\nare made in this way, it behooves us to take at least a brief glance\r\nat the knitting industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Transferring Design to Copper Roller_]\r\n\r\nThe principle of knitting is so familiar to every one who is or has\r\na mother or wife that no description of it is necessary. Curiously\r\nenough, although the original stocking frame was invented as far back\r\nas 1589, power was applied to the industry for the first time at\r\nCohoes, N. Y., in 1832. This city is still the centre of underwear\r\nmanufacture in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cloth in Tenter-frame_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Two Types of Machines_]\r\n\r\nKnitting is now done on two general types of machines: the flat bed\r\nknitter, and the circular knitting machine. In the former the garment\r\nis knit in one flat piece and seamed afterwards. Underwear made in\r\nthis way is described as full-fashioned. On the circular machine a\r\nseam is not necessary, for the complete cylinder of fabric is made\r\nat once. While it is possible to manufacture underwear on a circular\r\nframe, its use is far better adapted to the knitting of hosiery, and\r\na very large industry for the manufacture of this product has grown\r\nup in and near Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Flat Bed Knitter_]\r\n\r\nThe Cotton Knitting Frame, invented in 1864, is still the basis of\r\nthe modern flat-bed knitter. The product is a flat web which can be\r\nwidened or narrowed by transferring the loops from the edge needles\r\nto a separate instrument, and then replacing them. In knitting\r\nstockings, the shaped legs are made on one machine, then transferred\r\nto a heeler, and then to a third machine which knits the feet. The\r\nstockings then must be seamed up the back. The largest machines are\r\ncapable of knitting twenty-four garments at one time. The advantage\r\nof this type is that it produces more elastic fabric, but it\r\nrequires more operatives and more highly skilled labor than the\r\ncircular machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Calendar_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Circular Machine_]\r\n\r\nA series of inventions made in Philadelphia from 1867 to 1889\r\nperfected the completely automatic circular machine of which there\r\nare now more than seven times as many in use in this country than\r\nthere are full-fashioned knitters. The seamless machine goes on\r\ncontinuously and manufactures the entire garment at once. Narrowing\r\nis done by shortening the loops, and this accounts for the loss of\r\nelasticity.\r\n\r\nThe finishing operations consist of seaming, where necessary, and\r\nremoving imperfections.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Growth_]\r\n\r\nThe growth and importance of the industry is perhaps best realized\r\nfrom the fact that in 1870 there were 5,625 machines in the country,\r\nin 1905, 88,374, and now well over one hundred thousand. In 1850 men\r\nwore hand-knitted socks and flannel underwear. From 1860 to 1910 the\r\nproduct of the country’s knitting machines rose from $7,300,000 to\r\n$200,100,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Folding_]\r\n\r\nCotton yarn is used more than woolen because it spins more cheaply\r\nand is less difficult to knit.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. OTHER COTTON PRODUCTS\r\n\r\nBefore concluding this part of our survey which deals with the\r\nmanufacture of cotton into finished goods, we must at least enumerate\r\nsome of the by-products and minor fruits of the industry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Seed Oil_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Linters_]\r\n\r\nTo begin with, at the time that the cotton is ginned the seeds are\r\nsold to the manufacturers of cotton oil. Without going into detail as\r\nto the process, we have here an annual product for this country worth\r\n$384,000,000. Seed mills regin the seed before they crush it and\r\nremove the short fibres which have hitherto adhered to the seed. This\r\nregained cotton is known as linters and amounts annually to about\r\n800,000 bales.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Felt and Surgical Dressings_]\r\n\r\nBeing of very short staple this reginned cotton is adapted for the\r\nmanufacture of felts and surgical dressings, both of which are\r\nimportant by-products.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lace_]\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of small-wares and lace curtains is another minor\r\nbranch of cotton manufacture. Here, however, domestic production\r\nis comparatively small, and the bulk of the lace used is imported.\r\nNevertheless probably over 75,000,000 yards[3] of the lace are made\r\nannually in this country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Gun Cotton_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Collodion_]\r\n\r\nGun-cotton, a highly explosive substance, is obtained by soaking\r\ncotton (usually linters) in nitric and sulphuric acids and then\r\nleaving it to dry. And again, gun-cotton dissolved in ether and\r\nalcohol yields the much used surgical adhesive known as collodion.\r\n\r\nThe stems and leaves of the cotton plant are used for fodder, the\r\nseed hulls for fertilizer, and there is in fact no part of the plant\r\nfrom which man has not learned to derive some useful product.\r\n\r\n[3] This figure is only roughly approximated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFROM MILL TO CONSUMER\r\n\r\n\r\n1. INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\nBefore we proceed to discuss the various ways in which cotton goods\r\nare marketed we shall first take a cursory glance at the way in which\r\nthe industry is subdivided.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Mill Treasurer_]\r\n\r\nThe president of a cotton mill is usually not the active head of the\r\nbusiness; his position corresponds to that of the chairman of the\r\nboard of directors in the usual banking or mercantile corporation.\r\nThe mill treasurer is, on the other hand, the chief directive force,\r\nand he performs the two all-important functions of buying the mill’s\r\nraw cotton and selling its product, either direct or through other\r\nchannels. In the mills of New Bedford and Fall River, which make\r\nchiefly gray goods, the treasurer usually has his office at the mill.\r\nIn most other New England mills the treasurer is usually a member of\r\na selling house and is frequently the treasurer for more than one\r\nmill.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Agent or Supt._]\r\n\r\nWhere the treasurer has his office in the mill the man who has\r\ncharge of the actual operation is known as the mill superintendent.\r\nHis functions include the general management of the plant and the\r\npurchasing of supplies other than cotton. Where the treasurer\r\nmaintains his office in a selling house, the operating head is\r\nknown as an Agent and enjoys a greater degree of responsibility and\r\nindependence. There are of course a varying number of minor operating\r\nchiefs in charge of sundry departments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spinning and Weaving in Same Plant_]\r\n\r\nThe average New England cotton mill contains about fifty thousand\r\nspindles, while the Southern mill runs about twenty-five thousand.\r\nThe vast majority of mills do both spinning and weaving, although\r\nsome Southern mills sell yarn and some Pennsylvania establishments\r\ndo nothing but weave. Of the entire number of spindles in the\r\ncountry, 83%, and of the looms 97%, are in mills which do both\r\nspinning and weaving.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Segregation of the Converter_]\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the tendency towards unification in spinning and\r\nweaving is the ever-increasing segregation of the converting plants.\r\nThe rise of the merchant-converter, the growing demand for a great\r\nvariety of finishes, and the fact that converting is very much\r\ncheaper on a large scale, have all brought about an increasing\r\ntendency on the part of the mill to sell its cloth in the gray, or to\r\nhave it finished on commission.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Knitting_]\r\n\r\nWhile a few large knitting mills spin their own yarn, this is the\r\nexception rather than the rule. On the other hand the knitting mills\r\nfinish their product for the market themselves, and sell either\r\ndirect or through a selling house.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS\r\n\r\nThere are four general ways in which a cotton mill may dispose of\r\nits products: a. by selling direct, b. through a selling house, c.\r\nthrough a broker, d. through a converter.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _a._\r\n\r\n_Selling Direct_]\r\n\r\nA few very large mills maintain selling offices of their own in the\r\nlarge centers of distribution through which they market their goods\r\ndirect to the jobbers and retailers. In most cases where direct\r\nselling is done, however, the goods are sold in the gray by the mill\r\ntreasurer at the mill. This practice is common with those mills which\r\nmake staple gray goods and which, when not sold ahead, are able to\r\nmanufacture for stock against spot sales. A few Southern yarn mills\r\nalso sell direct.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _b._\r\n\r\n_Growth of the Selling House_]\r\n\r\nThe relation between the manufacturer and commercial banker or\r\ncommission house is as old as the industry itself. Slater’s first\r\nmill in 1790 was financed by Almy & Brown of Boston, who undertook to\r\nmarket his goods and also to furnish him the credit he needed to buy\r\ncotton and supplies. In the early days the cloth was sold at auction\r\nby the selling house and the proceeds less commission credited to the\r\nmill. Later on the factors developed extensive selling organizations\r\nthroughout the country by means of which they were able to market the\r\nproducts of a good many mills.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_Fancies_”]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Finances_]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of fancy goods requires a great deal of skill. The\r\nFall and Spring lines to be manufactured by the mills are sent out\r\nto the trade by the selling house about six months ahead, and orders\r\nare taken before manufacture begins so as to be sure that the line\r\nwill “take”. Of course there is always the danger of cancellations\r\neven then, for which the selling house must bear most of the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nIn addition to distributing the goods and guaranteeing the accounts,\r\nthe commission house renders financial assistance either by advancing\r\non the mill’s product, or by indorsing its notes. In return it\r\nreceives the sole agency for the mill’s products, interest on the\r\nmoney advanced and a commission. The latter varies with the amount of\r\nfinancial assistance required by the mill and the desirability of the\r\nrisk.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule the Southern mills, because of their distance\r\nfrom the chief markets in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia, are\r\nmore dependent upon their selling agents than the New England\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nIn New England a great number of manufacturers are amply able to\r\nfinance themselves, and could if necessary sell their own products.\r\nStock ownership, however, and old ties have frequently kept up the\r\nrelationship with the selling houses after its usefulness was partly\r\noutworn. Nevertheless in the selling of fancy goods, even where\r\nthe mill is supplied with plenty of capital, the commission house\r\nfulfills a very necessary function.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _c._\r\n\r\n_The Broker_]\r\n\r\nGray goods are very often sold either by a mill or a selling house\r\nthrough the medium of a cloth broker. The latter is strictly a middle\r\nman in that he does nothing but bring together prospective purchaser\r\nand seller. In the event of sale he gets a commission of ½%, which he\r\noften more than earns by his efforts. These brokers are in touch with\r\nall the mills, converters, and consumers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _d._\r\n\r\n_Merchant Converters_]\r\n\r\nWhile there are some independent finishing establishments, most of\r\nthem operate on a commission basis for merchant converters. The\r\nlatter are a class of merchants of comparatively recent origin,\r\nhaving appeared first about 1880, since which time they have\r\npractically taken control of the finishing industry. They buy gray\r\ngoods either direct from the mill, or through a broker or selling\r\nhouse, and have them finished according to whatever they think the\r\nrequirements of the market are. Inasmuch as they pay on short credit\r\nand carry the goods during conversion, frequently selling on several\r\nmonths’ credit to jobbers and retailers, they perform an important\r\npart of the financing of the cloth. Their recent rapid rise has been\r\ndue largely to the growing demand for a multiplicity of seasonal\r\ndesigns.\r\n\r\nSome large cutters-up, and a few big mail-order houses do their own\r\nfinishing or have it done. As a rule they buy from converters and\r\nsell to the jobber, retailer, or consumer.\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the cotton from the seed through the various\r\nprocesses of manufacture and finishing, and followed the finished\r\ngoods through the channels of distribution to the consumer. It\r\nremains only for us to compare briefly the position of the United\r\nStates with that of other countries, and the position of the various\r\nsections within the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE POSITION OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n\r\n1. COTTON PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION\r\n\r\nEver since the Civil War the United States has produced more than\r\nhalf of the world’s cotton crop. From 1860 to 1900 about one-third\r\nof the annual crop was consumed by the domestic industries, and from\r\nthat time domestic takings have increased, except for 1921, to an\r\naverage of about 50% in the last few years. During the same period\r\nthe actual size of the annual crops increased enormously. If we take\r\nthe figures from the present back to 1790 it will give a rough idea\r\nof the progress since that time.\r\n\r\n  Year          Crop in bales          Exports     % of dom. takings\r\n                (of 500 lbs.)\r\n  1790                   3                  1              66\r\n  1850               2,136              1,854              13\r\n  1860               3,841                615              84\r\n  1870               4,024              2,922              28\r\n  1880               6,356              4,453              30\r\n  1890               8,562              5,850              32\r\n  1900              10,266              6,806              33\r\n  1910              12,005              8,205              32\r\n  1915              12,122              6,405              47\r\n  1917              12,428              4,587              64\r\n  1919              12,028              6,760              44\r\n  1921               8,351              6,479              23\r\n  1922              10,369              5,049              52\r\n                  (Expressed in thousands of bales)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORLD’S COTTON PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n1908]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORLD’S COTTON PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n1922-3]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORLD’S COTTON CONSUMPTION\r\n\r\n1908]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORLD’S COTTON CONSUMPTION\r\n\r\n1922-3]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE BANK, INC.

SHEEP RAISING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Early History_]\r\n\r\nThe raising of sheep goes so far back into primitive times that\r\nhistorians have been compelled to draw a veil over its origin.\r\nWhether sheep antedate man, or man existed before sheep, is a\r\nquestion that has never been authoritatively answered. For our\r\npurposes very little history will suffice. We know that sheep were\r\nraised in Biblical times, but we do not know much about them. We do\r\nknow, however, that the old Romans practised sheep-breeding with\r\ngreat care and even went so far as to cover their animals with cloth\r\nin order to preserve the clean quality of the fleece. During the\r\nreign of the Roman Emperor, Claudius (A. D., 50), an Italian named\r\nColumella, took several Italian sheep to Spain and crossed them with\r\nthe native Spanish Merino breed. It is said that the resulting type\r\nis the progenitor of all the Merino breeds which now form the basis\r\nof sheep-breeding. Under the rule of the Saracens, Spain became\r\nnot only a great sheep-raising country, but a woolen manufacturing\r\ncountry as well. In the thirteenth century there were no less than\r\nsixteen thousand looms in the town of Seville alone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spain_]\r\n\r\nWhen the Saracens were driven out by Philip III. the textile industry\r\ndisappeared from Spain, but sheep husbandry, which did not require\r\nskilled labor, remained, and Spanish wool continued to be the finest\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Europe_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spread of Merino_]\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century various European countries began\r\nto import merinos and cross them with their native breeds. This,\r\nbecause of the sturdy quality of some of the native types, frequently\r\nproduced excellent results. In France we thus have the origin of the\r\nRambouillet merino, in Germany and Austria of the Saxony and Silesian\r\nbreeds. In 1810 merinos were first introduced into Australia with\r\nastonishing results both as to grade of wool and increase of flocks.\r\nAbout the same time South America, South Africa, and the United\r\nStates imported Spanish sheep. Of all the highly civilized countries,\r\nEngland is the only one where merino breeding was not successful.\r\nThis was due in part to the climate, but the chief cause was the fact\r\nthat British sheep-raising was primarily for mutton purposes, and\r\nonly secondarily for wool. The merino types are smaller, and hence do\r\nnot yield as good mutton carcasses as some of the native “Down” and\r\n“Mountain” breeds. In many cases, however, the native English breeds,\r\nnotably the Lincolns, have been imported to other countries and there\r\ncrossed with merinos with very good success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Native Breeds_]\r\n\r\nIt would not be possible to give in detail the various breeds of\r\nsheep existing in different countries. Merino sheep are now bred in\r\nmany parts of the world, and, together with the high crossbreds,\r\nare the source of all the fine wools known as merino, half-blood,\r\nand three-eighths wools. Long wools are derived from various native\r\nbreeds, chiefly English, and from the lower crossbreds of merinos,\r\nsuch as quarter and low quarter bloods. Chinese, Siberian, and\r\nTurkish wools, as well as many other uncivilized types, are usually\r\nvery long and coarse, and are known as carpet and braid wools.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sources_]\r\n\r\nMost of the best merino wools come from Australia, the next best\r\nfrom South Africa, and from South America. The latter have one\r\nfault in that they contain many spiral burrs which are difficult to\r\nremove, and which frequently get through the machines and show up as\r\nimperfections in the cloth. Europe grows some very fine short wools,\r\nbut these hardly ever leave the countries they are grown in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _U. S. Domestic_]\r\n\r\nUnited States wools are known as “domestic” and “territory.” Domestic\r\nwools are those grown in the eastern and middle western states,\r\nnotably in the Ohio valley. These contain the highest grades of\r\nmerino wools grown in this country. It must be remembered that\r\nsheep raising began in the East, and as civilization expanded, was\r\ngradually crowded further and further westward. The opening of the\r\nErie Canal in 1825 made available the fertile pasture lands of the\r\nOhio valley. The Ohio Canal eight years later opened up still more\r\nterritory, and in 1849 during the famous gold rush, sheep were first\r\ntaken to California.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Territory_]\r\n\r\nThe territory wools are those grown in the Rocky Mountain Plateau\r\nstates. Recently, with improved methods and greater care in breeding,\r\nsome very fine wools have been derived from Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada,\r\nand Montana, and from a few other states. The Texas and California\r\nwools are usually classed separately, because they are in most cases\r\nclipped twice a year. A little later we shall discuss the various\r\ngrades and sorts of wool obtained from the different breeds, but as\r\nthe wool is shorn or pulled before it is graded, we shall take up\r\nthese processes first.\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE WEIGHTS OF DIFFERENT BREEDS OF SHEEP WITH WEIGHTS OF FLEECES\r\n\r\n    Breed              Ewes      Rams     Fleece\r\n                      Pounds    Pounds    Pounds\r\n  Leicester            185       235        10\r\n  Cotswold             200       285        12\r\n  Lincoln              250       300        15\r\n  Southdown            145       200         6  English Breeds (Mutton)\r\n  Shropshire           165       215         9\r\n  Oxford               220       275        11\r\n  Hampshire            200       275         8\r\n  Rambouillet Mer.     155       235        18\r\n  Amer.

SHEARING AND MARKETING OF FLEECE WOOL\r\n\r\nWool is obtained from the sheep in two ways; it is either shorn from\r\nthe live animal, or pulled from the skin of the slaughtered carcass.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Shearing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Australian System_]\r\n\r\nShearing was formerly done by hand. An expert was able to clip as\r\nmany as one hundred head per day, but the average was less than\r\nhalf of that amount. The introduction of machine shearing has made\r\nit possible for one man to shear from 175 to 200 sheep in a day,\r\nand the fleece is very much more evenly clipped than formerly. Some\r\nmerino breeds, known as type A, have so many folds of loose skin that\r\nmachine shearing is not feasible, but except for these animals, and\r\nsome of the type B or Rambouillet Merinos, almost all sheep are now\r\nshorn by machine, that is, where they are raised in numbers. Sheep\r\nraising in this country is not pursued with nearly so much care as,\r\nfor instance, in Australia. There they have huge shearing sheds where\r\nthe animals are first sweated and then carefully shorn. Whereas here\r\nthe entire fleece is left in one piece, in Australia the belly is\r\nshorn separately and each fleece is carefully skirted, that is, the\r\ninferior parts such as the britch are torn off. Then each fleece is\r\nfolded and tied up and the fleeces are put up in bales. Moreover, a\r\nbale usually contains fleeces of the same grade, so that practically\r\nnothing but sorting remains to be done by the purchaser. Here, on\r\nthe other hand, fleeces are shorn in one piece and are folded up\r\ncarelessly, without skirting. The tying up is frequently done in a\r\nslovenly manner, and a bag will very often contain all grades of wool\r\nfrom the finest to the coarsest. Of late years some attempt has been\r\nmade to install the Australian system, but without much success.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Seasons_]\r\n\r\nThe shearing season in the northern hemisphere is in the spring, in\r\ncountries below the equator, except Australia, it is, of course,\r\nin our fall. In Texas and California, as well as in some other\r\nlocalities, shearing is frequently done twice a year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Marketing_]\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, there are seven ways in which the wool grower may\r\ndispose of his fleece wool:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Merchant Buyers_]\r\n\r\n1. He may sell it to buyers representing merchants. The merchant,\r\nwhile he is a middle man and therefore incurs the usual anathema,\r\nperforms a variety of very essential services. At the time of the\r\nclip he sends his buyers to the wool producing centers and buys the\r\nclip for cash, then he ships it to his warehouse, grades it, and\r\nsells to the mills on credit. Obviously he finances a very important\r\npart of the production, and is furthermore essential, because he\r\nknows the demand, which the wool-grower does not, and the supply—of\r\nwhich the mill is usually ignorant.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mill Buyers_]\r\n\r\n2. The wool grower may also sell to buyers representing mills. He\r\nlikes to do this because he eliminates the merchant’s profit, but, as\r\na matter of fact, there are only very few mills large enough to stand\r\nthe buying expense, and even fewer that can afford to buy their\r\nwhole season’s supply of raw material at one time and for cash. Also,\r\nmills can usually employ only certain grades of wool, and cannot\r\ntherefore as a rule buy a whole clip.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Consignment_]\r\n\r\n3. If the grower thinks that he is not receiving fair offers from the\r\nvisiting buyers, he will frequently consign his wool to a merchant\r\nto be sold on commission for his account. In this case he may or may\r\nnot get a better price, but it costs him his carrying charges plus\r\ncommission. There are some wool houses that make it a specialty to\r\nexecute commission sales of this nature.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Local Mills_]\r\n\r\n4. Some wool is sold direct to nearby mills. This is done\r\nparticularly in Ohio, where many of the smaller mills obtain their\r\nentire requirements in this manner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Local Dealers_]\r\n\r\n5. Wool growers sometimes sell to local dealers. This is particularly\r\nprevalent in regions where the individual grower’s production is\r\nsmall. In most eastern states there are a great number of small\r\nfarmers who grow a certain amount of wool. The local dealers are in\r\nmany cases also the general store-keepers, and, since they are the\r\nfarmer’s creditor on other merchandise, and since the average farmer\r\nknows very little about the grades of wool, these individuals very\r\nfrequently turn a handsome profit when they in turn sell to the\r\nvisiting buyers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Coop. Sales_]\r\n\r\n6. Some wool is sold through farmers’ co-operative sales agencies,\r\nbut these organizations have in the past been so poorly administered,\r\nthat, as a general rule they have not been successful. The movement\r\nis, however, gaining ground and has shown great progress during\r\nrecent years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Auctions_]\r\n\r\n7. Finally, there remains the method whereby almost all the British\r\nand colonial wools are sold, namely, by auction. Auction sales have\r\nbeen established for almost a century in London, Liverpool, Antwerp,\r\nBremen, Hamburg, Marseilles, and recently in Australia. This method\r\nof disposing of their raw product does not, however, appeal to the\r\nAmerican growers, because of the inherent American trading instinct.\r\nIt is also not very feasible in this country, because the wool is\r\nnot graded in the shearing sheds and because sheep-raising in not\r\nstandardized.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Markets_]\r\n\r\nThe chief markets for wool in this country are Boston, Philadelphia,\r\nChicago, New York and St. Louis.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. PULLED WOOL\r\n\r\nWe have above discussed the shearing and marketing of wool obtained\r\nfrom the living animal. There remains a large quantity of wool which\r\nis taken from the pelts of slaughtered sheep. In 1919 there were\r\nproduced 48,300,000 pounds of pulled wool in the U. S. as against\r\n265,939,000 pounds of sheared wool.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Use_]\r\n\r\nSkin wool, or tanner’s wool, as it is sometimes known, is used\r\nextensively for soft twist yarns, bed blankets, flannels, felts, etc.\r\nIt is also used as an admixture in blends for top-making, as we shall\r\nsee later.\r\n\r\nThere are three methods whereby pulled wool is obtained.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sweating_]\r\n\r\nThe oldest and simplest process is known as sweating, and consists\r\nsimply in sweating the hides until the wool is loosened and can\r\neasily be pulled out. The disadvantage of this method is that it\r\ninjures the hides.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Lime_]\r\n\r\nThe lime process consists in loosening the wool by painting the flesh\r\nside of the hide with lime. This also injures the hides somewhat and\r\nhas a bad effect on the dyeing qualities of the wool.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Depilatory_]\r\n\r\nThe depilatory process is the best, and varies from the lime process\r\nonly in that a solution is used instead of lime. This mixture\r\nconsists of sodium sulphate, sulphuric acid, and oyster shells.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest pullery in the world is situated at Mazamet,\r\nFrance, where the industry has assumed gigantic proportions. The\r\nlarge packers in this country all operate their own pulleries, and\r\nthe pulled wool is marketed largely by them. Most mills buy their\r\npulled wool direct from the pulleries, but some is handled by\r\nmerchants.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. WHAT IS WOOL\r\n\r\nWe have now traced the wool from the sheep’s back as far as the bag,\r\nand may assume that the bag has travelled from the shearing shed\r\nto the merchant’s or mill’s warehouse. Some foreign wools, notably\r\nAustralian and South American, are, as we have seen, skirted and\r\nroughly graded in the shearing shed, so that, when the bag is opened,\r\nthere remains only the sorting to do. Grading is the separation\r\nof fleeces into classified groups. Skirting is the removal from\r\neach fleece of the worst parts, namely, the britch wool, manure\r\nlocks (known as tags), and matted or kempy portions. Sorting is the\r\ndividing of the individual fleece into various classifications.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Wool as Against Hair_]\r\n\r\nBefore we take up the grades and sorts in detail, it will be well\r\nfor us to inquire briefly into the nature of the wool fibre. In the\r\nfirst place, wool differs from hair in that its fibre consists of a\r\ncore (medulla), a pulp (cortex), and an epidermis. A hair follicle\r\nconsists of a medulla and an epidermis. Moreover, the epidermis\r\nof a hair is closely and evenly scaled, which makes it smooth and\r\nlustrous. The surface of a wool fibre is not evenly serrated, which\r\naccounts for the felting, or interlocking, quality. Wool in which\r\nthere is insufficient moisture and natural grease (yolk) frequently\r\nbecomes felted at the ends. Such wool is variously referred to as\r\ncotted, cotty, or brashy. The tensile strength of a wool fibre is\r\nlow, its elasticity high. The length of the fibre varies from one\r\nto over ten inches, and the diameter from .0018 to .004 inches. The\r\nbetter a wool the less like it is to a hair. Generally speaking,\r\nthe finer the wool, the shorter the fibre, but length alone would\r\nnot indicate the grade. Pure merino and high cross-bred wools have\r\na close wave, known as crimp, which increases the elasticity and is\r\ntherefore desirable from a spinning standpoint.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of wool is: carbon 50%, hydrogen 7%,\r\nnitrogen 18%, oxygen 22%, and sulphur 3%. It is soluble in alkalies,\r\nand at a temperature of 130° C. will reduce to powder.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Shrinkage_]\r\n\r\nWool before it is scoured contains a large quantity of yolk, or\r\nnatural grease, and also, besides dust and vegetable matter, a\r\nconsiderable amount of dried perspiration, or suint. The amount of\r\nweight lost through the removal of these substances when the wool\r\nis scoured is termed shrinkage. It will be readily appreciated that\r\nthis is a very important factor in connection with the purchase of\r\ngrease wool. The percentage of shrinkage varies from 20% to 80%.\r\nNevertheless a good buyer will often be able to estimate within one\r\nor two per cent. The factors to be considered in this connection are\r\nthe breed, the soil, the climate, and the care with which the sheep\r\nare raised, as well as the diligence with which the fleeces are put\r\nup. Fine wools always shrink more heavily than coarse; and pulled\r\nwools, since they are washed and brushed during the process, show a\r\nvery much lower shrinkage than fleece wools. The average shrinkage of\r\nUnited States wools is about 55%. Fine domestics shrink about 60%.\r\nLower grades about 45%. Fine territory wools about 65%; lower grades\r\nabout 55%. Pulled wool averages about 27%. Fine Australian wools\r\naverage 49%, for, although they are the finest, the fleeces contain\r\nless dirt. Cape wools about 62%, and South American about 51%.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Qualities Desired_]\r\n\r\nThe qualities looked for in wool are roughly six, and they vary\r\naccording to the purpose for which the wool is to be used.\r\n\r\n1. It must be fine enough to spin the required number of counts.\r\n\r\n2. It must be strong enough to withstand strain of manufacture.\r\n\r\n3. It must have the proper staple (length).\r\n\r\n4. It must be of a certain softness or hardness.\r\n\r\n5. It must have the proper felting qualities if the material is to be\r\nfulled.\r\n\r\n6. It must either scour white, or else have sufficient lustre to take\r\ndyes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Clothing and Combing_]\r\n\r\nAs we take up the manufacture of worsted and woolen yarns we shall\r\nsee how these qualifications play a different part in the two\r\nprocesses. At the outset the only important difference we are\r\nconcerned with is staple length. Generally speaking, wools under two\r\ninches are too short to be combed and are classed as clothing wools.\r\n_Clothing wools are used for woolens, combing wools for worsteds._\r\nThis applies only to wools of fine fibre. The mere fact that a wool\r\nhas long staple length does not make it a combing wool. As a rule,\r\nthe coarser the wool the longer its staple, and the longest wools are\r\nthe exceedingly coarse “common” or “braid” wools, which can only be\r\nused for carpet manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Sorting Wool_]\r\n\r\nIn grading and sorting, practically the only guide is the fineness of\r\nthe individual fibre. The other qualifications just enumerated have\r\na very important bearing on what the wool can be used for, but they\r\nhave very little to do with its classification by grades.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Classifications_]\r\n\r\nFleece wools are graded by two systems, one by bloods, the other by\r\ncounts spun. (This means the number of hanks of 560 yards each to\r\na pound of yarn.) Domestic and foreign wools are usually graded by\r\nbloods. U. S. Territory wools are graded a little differently, as\r\nper second column below, and pulled wool is only roughly graded into\r\nfour classes (third column). The blood classifications originated\r\nfrom the breeding of the sheep, but, as a matter of fact they have\r\nbecome arbitrary terms denoting a certain degree of fineness. The\r\nsame fleece may, and frequently does, contain ½, ⅜, and ¼ blood wool.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE GRADES\r\n\r\n  U. S.           U. S.      Pulled  U. S.

The grader simply decides what the majority of the fleece\r\nis and puts it into that class. When he has filled a basket with,\r\nlet us say, half-blood fleeces, this basket is given to a sorter.\r\nHe takes each fleece, shakes it out, and, first of all, skirts it.\r\nThen he separates it into the various sorts it contains. Fleeces\r\ngraded as half-blood will probably sort into mostly half, some fine\r\n(full-blood), and a considerable quantity of three-eighths blood. The\r\nbest wool comes off the shoulders, then the sides, then the back,\r\nthen the thighs, and finally the britch and belly. Usually a fleece\r\nwill not contain more than three sorts.\r\n\r\nIf this were a bag of Australian, South American, or Cape wool,\r\nthe fleeces would in all probability have been bagged according to\r\ngrades, so that only the sorting operation would have to be performed\r\nby the merchant or the mill.\r\n\r\nWhen the wool has been sorted it is put into bins, and may now be\r\nsaid to be ready for the first of the manufacturing processes for\r\nwhich it is destined. Sorting is sometimes done by the merchants, but\r\nmore frequently by the manufacturers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Off-sorts_]\r\n\r\nKempy or cotted pieces, tags, stained or painty wool, etc., are\r\ncalled off-sorts, and these are put through a number of processes for\r\nthe purpose of reclaiming as much of the wool as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scouring Machine_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWORSTED MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n1. SCOURING\r\n\r\nWhen the wool has been graded it is sold either to worsted\r\nmanufacturers or to makers of woolen goods. The two industries are\r\nentirely distinct and separate.\r\n\r\nThe first cog in the worsted machine is the wool comber, or\r\ntop-maker. Sometimes he buys assorted grades, known as matchings,\r\nfrom a wool merchant; sometimes he buys and sorts his own wool; but\r\nmost frequently he sorts and combs the wool on a commission basis.\r\nMany of the big worsted mills do their own sorting and combing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Blending_]\r\n\r\nTops are usually made from blends of various kinds of wool, and this\r\nblending is done after sorting, before the wool is scoured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scouring_]\r\n\r\nScouring is nothing more or less than a glorified washing. A machine\r\nclosely akin to a gigantic laundry machine removes first the yolk\r\nor grease in an alkaline solution, and then rinses out the dirt and\r\nsuint in a series of soap and water baths. The last bath is pure\r\nwater, and from this the wool is taken on a belt through the drier.\r\nFrom the drier it is usually blown through tubes to the carding room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Worsted carding Machine_]\r\n\r\nApproximately 20% of the moisture is allowed to remain in the wool in\r\norder to facilitate subsequent processes. If the wool is still warm\r\nit is easier to card.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CARDING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Opens Fibres_]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the carding operation is to open out the fibres in the\r\nwool. Originally, carding was done by hand with two leather surfaces,\r\nmuch like butter pats, the inner faces of which were studded with\r\nwire nails. Between these two surfaces the wool was rubbed until\r\nall the fibres were opened out. In woolen manufacture carding is\r\nmore violent and seeks to lay the fibres in all directions. Worsted\r\ncarding aims to separate the fibres, but also to keep them as closely\r\nparallel as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Woolen card. Feed end_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Woolen card. Condenser end_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Back Washing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Card_]\r\n\r\nThe carding machine is somewhat similar to that used for cotton (see\r\npage 22). The wool is automatically fed between the feed rollers,\r\nwhich revolve in opposite directions and are armed with heavy teeth.\r\nFrom the feed a roller known as the licker-in starts the wool on its\r\ncourse over a number of cylinders, each of which is surrounded by\r\nseveral toothed rollers known as workers. Each worker has a smaller\r\ncompanion roller, revolving at a higher speed, which derives its\r\nname of stripper from the fact that its function is to take the wool\r\noff the worker and deliver it to the next worker. The last roller,\r\nknown as the fancy, raises the wool off the cylinder to be caught\r\nby the doffer. The doffing-comb lifts the wool in a filmy sheet of\r\nfibres, which is condensed into a thick untwisted rope by passing\r\nthrough a funnel on to the balling-head. This rope, which is about an\r\ninch and a half in diameter, is known as a sliver. A certain length\r\nof it is automatically rolled into balls and these are taken into\r\nthe back-wash room. From a loose unrelated mass the wool has now\r\nbeen transformed into a continuous strand of more or less uniform\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gilling before combing_]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. BACKWASHING AND GILLING\r\n\r\nA back-wash machine takes several of the carded slivers and combines\r\nthem into one. The slivers pass through several baths which rinse\r\nthem thoroughly and are then slowly drawn through a drier. The\r\nprocess is quite similar to scouring, except that it is very much\r\nless violent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Combining and Drawing Slivers_]\r\n\r\nAs the slivers come out of the drier they are fed through a number\r\nof gill boxes. The gill box is the first of a long series of drawing\r\noperations. In this, and all the following stages of open drawing,\r\nthere are always several slivers being combined into one and drawn\r\nout until the resulting sliver has about the same or a smaller\r\ndiameter than the ones fed into the machine. The principle of the\r\ngill box is quite simple. Several slivers are fed in between rollers\r\nrevolving at a comparatively low rate of speed. As they pass through\r\nthey are flattened out over what is known as a faller. This is armed\r\nwith very fine close wire teeth which come up through the fibres\r\nand the draft is imparted when the wool is taken off the faller by\r\na final pair of rollers which are revolving considerably faster.\r\nThe sheet of wool which emerges from these rollers is again passed\r\nthrough a funnel and thereby condensed once more into a sliver.\r\nThis operation is repeated from two to four times, according to\r\nthe quality of the top desired, and the methods employed by the\r\nparticular mill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gilling the top_]\r\n\r\nWhere very coarse long fibred wool is to be worked there is no\r\ncarding, and the wool is prepared by straightening the fibres into a\r\nsliver through a series of gill-boxes.\r\n\r\nAt some point during the gilling process a slight amount of oil is\r\nusually dropped onto the sliver, as this facilitates combing.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. COMBING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Removes Short Fibres_]\r\n\r\nThe next operation, namely that of combing, is again simple when\r\nviewed as the primitive manufacturing process. The old comber would\r\ntake a short length of sliver, hang it on a nail by tying one end\r\ntogether and then proceed to comb out the short fibres much as one\r\nmay comb out the dead short hairs from a dog’s coat. Combing is\r\nsimply the removal from the sliver of the short fibres which would\r\nnot spin properly. These short fibres are known as noils and are the\r\nwaste product of top-making. The top is a continuous untwisted strand\r\nof long wool fibres made parallel by the comb. (By long fibres we\r\nmean fibres which are relatively long. Some tops consist of fibres\r\nless than an inch and a half in length. In this case, which is very\r\ninfrequent, the noil would be even shorter.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Noble Comb_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Noils_]\r\n\r\nNoils are sold either to woolen or knitting mills direct by the\r\ntop-maker, or else to a merchant who disposes of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Noble Comb_]\r\n\r\nThe Noble circular comb is the most generally used combing machine.\r\nOther types are the Lister, the Holden, and the Heilmann. The Noble\r\ncomb is a compact circular structure standing at a height of about\r\nthree feet from the floor, with a steam box underneath it. (Heat\r\ngreatly facilitates the process.) There are two smaller circles\r\ninside the main circumference which are tangent to the outer circle\r\nat opposite points of its diameter. All rotate in the same direction.\r\nSeventy-two slivers are rolled up in creels on the outside of the\r\nmain circle and are automatically fed on to the tangental points.\r\nA dabbing brush pushes the slivers down between the points of the\r\ntwo circles. As the circles draw apart the long fibres are left\r\nprotruding from the inner edge of the outer circle and the outer\r\nedge of the inner circles. They travel thus until they are gripped\r\nby vertical rollers set to catch them. After passing the rollers\r\nthe wool is lifted off the pins of the circles by knives. The four\r\nribbons of combed fibres (two from the outer and one from each of the\r\ninner circles) are condensed into a single beautiful even band which\r\ncoils itself softly into a revolving can. What remains is the waste\r\nor noil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Gilling the Top_]\r\n\r\nThe top, as it comes from the comb, is again put through a series of\r\nseveral gill boxes with the object of further drawing it out. Once\r\nagain several slivers are combined into one in each process. At the\r\nend of this gilling the top is coiled in balls and allowed to rest.\r\n\r\nWe have now reduced the wool to its real worsted basis. The noils\r\nhave been taken out, and the balls of top are ready to be sent to the\r\nspinner to be spun into worsted yarn.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. SPINNING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Drawing_]\r\n\r\nThe first processes in a spinning mill very closely approximate\r\nthe last operations in the combing plant. The tops are usually\r\ngilled several times before weighing, and then are put through\r\nseveral drawing machines in which, as heretofore, several slivers\r\nare condensed into one. In the last of these machines there are\r\nno fallers, the entire process consisting of two sets of rollers\r\nrevolving at different speed. Each operation results in a slightly\r\nfiner sliver, and the number of machines through which the material\r\nis drawn is determined by the fineness of the yarn desired.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _French_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _English_]\r\n\r\nThe last of the drawing processes is the so-called roving box, which,\r\nin most cases is a cone-drawing process. There is a difference here\r\nbetween French spinning and English spinning. According to the French\r\nsystem, which is employed in this country only for very soft fine\r\nyarns, no twist is given to the sliver until the actual spinning\r\nbegins; and the spinning is then usually done on mules, which in this\r\ncountry are rarely used in the manufacture of worsted yarn. We shall\r\ndiscuss these machines when we come to woolens. According to the most\r\ncommon procedure in this country, the roving box not only draws,\r\nbut imparts a certain amount of twist to the yarn. This is done by\r\nwinding the yarn from horizontal spools on to vertical spindles.\r\nThese spindles are set on long frames, similar to spinning frames,\r\none frame containing about 200 spindles. The yarn is guided on the\r\nbobbin by an arm, known as the flyer, which draws the bobbin around\r\nafter it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spinning_]\r\n\r\nThere is very little difference between this last drawing operation\r\nand the actual spinning which immediately succeeds it. In both cases\r\nthe yarn is unwound from horizontal spools placed at the top of the\r\nframe through the inevitable two rollers going at different speeds,\r\nand guided on to the revolving spindle. Since the spindle revolves\r\nvertically the yarn is twisted. The amount of twist is regulated,\r\nas is also the amount of tension, and these two factors, together\r\nwith the quality of the material, determine the quality of the yarn.\r\nWorsted yarn is graded according to the number of counts, which, as\r\nwe have seen, is the number of hanks of 560 yards that make a pound\r\navoirdupois.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Flyer_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cap_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Ring_]\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, there are three modern methods of spinning,\r\nnamely, the flyer, cap, and ring frames. All of them are derived\r\nfrom Arkwright’s original water throstle, and, if we want to go\r\nfurther back, from the old-fashioned spinning wheel. The chief\r\ndifference between the three types lies in the method of driving\r\nthe spindle and guiding the yarn on to the bobbin. The flyer arm we\r\nhave described briefly above. In the cap system, the bobbin is moved\r\nup and down in a fixed metal cap, something like the front end of a\r\ntwo-inch shell-casing, and this method of guiding the yarn has the\r\nadvantage that, because of its lower vibration, the spindles may be\r\ndriven faster. It also causes considerably more friction on the yarn.\r\nFor worsted spinning it is probably the most commonly employed. Ring\r\nspinning, the most frequently used for cotton, and described briefly\r\non page 28, is very similar (to the layman) except that the spindle\r\nrevolves in a metal sleeve, and that the yarn is guided by a metal\r\nring with a traveller, instead of by the end of the cap.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Reducing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Twisting_]\r\n\r\nWhat follows now is merely an auxiliary process of spinning. The\r\nyarn has been completed, but it is rarely used for weaving, as it\r\ncomes off the spindle. Several strands are usually twisted together,\r\nboth to make it stronger and to give various effects of body and\r\ncolor. The number of strands in a yarn are designated as plys. Yarn\r\nconsisting of two strands is called two-ply, three strands are\r\nthree-ply, and so on. Yarns of two or more colors, or yarns of\r\nvarying counts, are frequently twisted together. It is possible also\r\nto twist worsted and cotton yarns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cap spinning_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spindlage_]\r\n\r\nTwisting is done in a manner similar to spinning. A worsted spinning\r\nmill usually has about a third as many twisting spindles as spinning\r\nspindles, but it is important to remember that when speaking of\r\na mill’s capacity in terms of spindles, it is only the spinning\r\nspindles that are counted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Winding or Skeining_]\r\n\r\nAfter the twisting is completed the finished yarn is wound on small\r\nspools, known as cheesers, to be weighed. Next it is wound on large\r\nspools in such a way that the large spool holds the contents of from\r\nten to twenty cheesers, each wound in an adjacent space at the same\r\ntime. Some of the yarn is shipped to weaving mills on these large\r\nspools; and some of it is taken off them and skeined.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Waste_]\r\n\r\nWe are now ready to weave the cloth, but there are a considerable\r\nnumber of very interesting details which we have been forced to\r\nomit. All the processes we have discussed produce a certain amount\r\nof waste material. The combing waste, known as noils, is the largest\r\nby-product of the worsted industry, but there is also a considerable\r\namount of yarn waste produced in the various drawing and spinning\r\noperations. Practically all of this material finds its way back,\r\nin one form or another, into the woolen industry. The subject of\r\nreclaiming waste is in itself so comprehensive that we can do no more\r\nthan touch upon it here.\r\n\r\n\r\n6. DYEING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Wool and Piece and Double Dyeing_]\r\n\r\nSome yarns are dyed after they have been spun. In most cases,\r\nhowever, woolen yarns receive their color after the wool is scoured\r\nand before it goes into the carding machine. In worsted manufacture\r\nthe common procedure is to dye the top after it has been combed.\r\nIn this way a uniform color is obtained, whereas it is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to obtain the same color from two vats in piece-dyeing.\r\nSome materials are both wool and piece-dyed, the second dye being\r\ngiven to the cloth. This is done in cases where a peculiarly fast\r\ncolor is desired, or where the cloth contains separate materials such\r\nas wool and cotton.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the loom has already been described in connection\r\nwith the manufacture of cotton, but the preparatory processes,\r\nalthough somewhat similar, vary considerably because of the\r\ndifference in the nature of the materials. In worsted manufacture the\r\nwork which has to be done before the loom can begin to operate is\r\nusually referred to as loom-mounting, and consists of five stages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Warping_]\r\n\r\n1. Warping is the arranging of the warp threads in the order\r\nnecessary to produce the desired cloth. This was formerly, and still\r\nis to a great extent, done entirely by hand on a sort of rack known\r\nas the woof. In the larger mills, however, warping is now done either\r\non a sectional warping machine or on the warping mill. Both these\r\ndevices are only partly automatic, and require highly-skilled labor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sizing_]\r\n\r\n2. The mechanical structure of woolen or worsted yarns necessitates\r\nthe application of some glutinous substance to their surfaces before\r\nsubjecting them to the weaving process. No matter how even the\r\nworsted yarn, a microscopic examination would show certain fibres\r\nprotruding from the surface. Sizing has the effect of smoothing\r\nthe surface of the yarn, and at the same time distributing more\r\nevenly the strain of weaving. The sizing machine is rather like the\r\nback-washer used in the manufacturing of worsted yarn. The warp is\r\nrun through the sizing bath and then compressed between rollers,\r\nafter which it is dried by steam or fan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Beaming_]\r\n\r\n3. Beaming is the term applied to winding the warp upon the beam of\r\nthe loom. (The beam is the roller from which the warp threads are\r\nunwound as the weaving progresses.) In order to keep the threads in\r\ntheir proper position an instrument known as a raddle is employed,\r\nand the raddling process is one which requires considerable care.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Drawing in the warp threads_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Healding_]\r\n\r\n4. The next step, healding, is the same as that described on page 34\r\nand enables the warp threads to be lifted in sections in order that\r\nthe shuttle may pass under some and over others. From the original\r\nweave of lifting alternate threads, a great many complicated designs\r\nhave been evolved, which necessitate the lifting of the warp threads\r\nin many small series. In the elementary weave where there are only\r\ntwo groups, this work is done by heald-wires which raise the odd\r\nand depress the even threads, thus forming a V, known as the shed,\r\nthrough which the shuttle may pass. As the design becomes more\r\nintricate the healding process becomes more complicated, and the\r\nnumber of heald shafts increases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sleying_]\r\n\r\n5. Sleying, or reeding, is the final preparatory process, and has\r\nthe object of keeping the warp threads the proper distance apart\r\nduring weaving. The sley is really nothing more than a fine comb with\r\na strip across the ends of the teeth. The warp threads are passed\r\nbetween the wires (reeds) of the sley and are so compelled to keep\r\ntheir proper position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Weaving_]\r\n\r\nThe sley is attached to the batten, or fly, and as in the cotton loom\r\nperforms the additional function of driving home each weft thread\r\nafter the shuttle has passed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Power Loom_]\r\n\r\nOnce these processes have been completed the remainder is almost\r\nentirely automatic. The shuttle flies back and forth without aid. The\r\nproper warp threads are raised and lowered to let it pass, and after\r\neach traverse, or pick, the batten automatically drives home the weft\r\nthread, into the growing stretch of cloth that is winding itself up\r\non to the beam at one end, while the beam at the other end delivers\r\nthe parallel warp threads. The average worsted loom makes about 100\r\npicks per minute, which is only about half as fast as the calico\r\nloom, the reason being the lower tensile strength of the yarn.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. WORSTED FINISHING\r\n\r\nWhile, as we shall see, finishing in the woolen industry is a very\r\nimportant stage of manufacture, worsted materials are practically\r\nunchanged after they come out of the loom. There is sometimes a\r\ncertain amount of fulling and raising and cropping, but the net\r\nresult does not in any way alter the cloth, except perhaps to impart\r\na little smoother finish. We shall discuss finishing in a little more\r\ndetail when we come to the last stage of woolen manufacture.\r\n\r\nOur worsted cloth is now finished, and we have traced its origin,\r\nsomewhat sketchily, from the back of the sheep up to the point where\r\nit takes only a tailor to put it on the back of a man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWOOLEN MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THE MANUFACTURE OF WOOLEN YARN\r\n\r\nWe have taken the worsted industry first, not because it is\r\nnecessarily any more important than woolen manufacture, but because\r\nits processes are more complicated, and therefor, if we have gained\r\na certain amount of familiarity with them, we are able to take up\r\nthe sister industry in a more abbreviated manner. Although, at the\r\npresent time, the demand for worsted materials is a great deal\r\nheavier than the demand for woolens, the woolen industry is by far\r\nthe older of the two, and may rightfully claim that the worsted\r\nbranch is really an off-shoot of its tree. Moreover, while broadcloth\r\nand similar material no longer enjoy their erstwhile popularity,\r\nthere is still a tremendous demand for other products of the woolen\r\nindustry such as blankets, flannels, overcoatings, etc. And we must\r\nbear in mind that most of the cheaper clothing materials are woolens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Raw Material_]\r\n\r\nIn the sorting of wool we saw that the shorter staples were classed\r\nas clothing wools. To these must be added the noils from worsted\r\ncombing, yarn waste, and wool reclaimed from off-sorts, as well as\r\nwool extract made from rags, before we have the raw material for the\r\nwoolen industry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Scouring_]\r\n\r\nWhereas we found that combing wool had to be left in the grease until\r\nit could be carded immediately after scouring, the maker of woolen\r\nyarn will buy wool that has been scoured months before. Most of the\r\nwool that is scoured by or near the growers finds its way into the\r\nwoolen industry for this reason. The scouring given to clothing wool\r\nvaries only in that it is more violent than that given to combing\r\nwool, and in that it is frequently augmented by carbonization to\r\nremove vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Mule Spinning_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Blending_]\r\n\r\nThe first process after scouring is blending. When the desired\r\nmixture of various grades, kinds, and colors of wool, wool extract,\r\nor cotton has been effected, the resulting heterogeneous mass is put\r\nthrough the first of several carding processes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fibres not parallel as in Worsted_]\r\n\r\nFrom now on the desire of the woolen yarn manufacturer is\r\ndiametrically opposed to that of the worsted comber. He wants to\r\nopen out the fibres, but he wants them to lie in all directions. He\r\ndoes not want uniformity. He wants just the opposite. His yarn must\r\nhave a certain amount of strength, but it must have, first of all,\r\nfelting properties, so that when the cloth is finished the various\r\nthreads will merge and interlock. As might be expected, therefore,\r\nthe carding process is very much more violent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Carding_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Condenser_]\r\n\r\nThe blend is first put through a fearnought which might be described\r\nbriefly as the most pitiless member of the card family. It is also\r\nknown as a tenter-hook-willy, from the reversed position of its\r\nteeth. From this machine the wool goes through the card proper, which\r\nis similar to the worsted card except that the rollers go in opposite\r\ndirections, instead of in the same directions. Here, again, the\r\ndoffer lifts the wool off in a continuous filmy sheet and delivers\r\nit to the condenser. The sheet is not simply drawn through a funnel\r\ninto a single thick sliver, but is forced between rollers into two\r\nleather rubbing aprons which by pressure and friction reduce it to a\r\nseries of small soft flabby slivers, having just enough adhesiveness\r\nto permit of mule spinning.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Burling and mending_]\r\n\r\nThe fibres in these slivers may be of all lengths and degrees of\r\nfineness, and they lie in all directions.\r\n\r\nThere are now no elaborate drawing or combing processes. All that\r\nremains to be done before we have a weavable woolen yarn is a certain\r\namount of twisting and attenuation. Both these results are obtained\r\nat once in the mule.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mule Spinning_]\r\n\r\nIn a woolen mule the spools of sliver are placed in a fixed frame,\r\nand the sliver passes between a pair of rollers to the spindles.\r\nThese stand, slightly inclined backwards, in a long row upon the\r\nmovable carriage. At first the spindle tips are close to the rollers.\r\nThe sliver is paid out, and at the same time the carriage bearing\r\nthe revolving spindles retreats. During this time no yarn is wound\r\non the bobbins, but the slivers are being twisted. Then the rollers\r\ncease to pay out sliver, the carriage moves out a little further,\r\nand the spindles rotate faster, so that the yarn is being twisted\r\nand stretched. When sufficient twist has been imparted the carriage\r\nmoves back again and the spindles wind up the twisted yarn on to the\r\nbobbins. This, briefly, is the operation of the mule. There are a\r\ngreat many intricate devices in this machine which deserve attention,\r\nbut which hardly fall within our scope. All that remains now is to\r\nwind the yarn on spools, or skein it, before it is ready for the\r\nweaver.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE MANUFACTURE OF WOOLEN CLOTH\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Weaving_]\r\n\r\nThere are many differences between weaving worsteds and woolens,\r\nbut for our purposes we may consider the process the same, as in\r\na general way it is. Some cloths are woven with a cotton warp and\r\na woolen yarn filling, the warp being carefully concealed. Woolen\r\ncloths are more frequently woven with a backing than worsteds. This\r\nmeans that either there is a double warp, a double weft, or both.\r\nThe object of backing is usually to add strength and warmth to the\r\nmaterial, and the lower side is therefore often woven of coarser\r\nyarn. In some cases, however, notably in travelling rugs, the backing\r\nmay be just as elaborate as the face, and this necessitates a rather\r\nintricate mounting process.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Carpets_]\r\n\r\nCarpet weaving is one of the large branches of the woolen industry,\r\nand for this purpose the coarsest and longest fibred wools (common,\r\nbraid, and carpet wools) are usually employed. These wools readily\r\nlend themselves to the manufacture of a coarse thick yarn, which in\r\nturn produces a thick, durable material. The thickness of a carpet is\r\nknown as the pile.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Finishing Important in Woolens_]\r\n\r\nWhereas we saw that the worsted cloth was practically finished when\r\nit left the loom, this is not the case with woolens. Oftentimes it\r\nwould tax an expert to identify the finished goods with the loose\r\nand altogether different material produced by the weaver. Some fine\r\nwoolens, it is true, are scarcely altered more than worsteds, but\r\nin most cases the finishing operations are in this industry a major\r\nrather than a subsidiary stage of manufacture. The reader may have\r\nbeen puzzled at the divergent lines along which woolen and worsted\r\nyarns are manufactured, and at a loss to account for the reasons.\r\nThe cause is precisely this, that the worsted manufacturer aims to\r\nproduce a cloth that is completed when woven, while the woolen maker\r\nwants his loom to turn out a material that will readily adopt a great\r\nvariety of finishes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Burling_]\r\n\r\nThe first finishing operation, which applies also to worsteds, is the\r\nexamination of the piece for imperfections and the removing of them\r\nby hand. The piece is then scoured to get rid of dirt, and, where\r\nthe finish is complicated, this may be repeated several times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fulling_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Fulling_]\r\n\r\nFulling, the next and very important process, consists in passing the\r\nmaterial through closed or partially enclosed boxes, in which the\r\ncloth is run through soap solutions and then forced through rollers.\r\nThe result of fulling is to shrink the material and give more body to\r\nit. It is chiefly in order to be able to do this that the maker of\r\nwoolens wants the fibres in his yarn to lie criss-cross, so that in\r\nthe fulling mill their serrated edges will felt and interlock with\r\neach other. The amount of fulling done depends upon the shrinkage\r\ndesired. It is possible to reduce the size of the cloth by half in\r\nthis process. Some worsteds are slightly fulled, but in their case\r\nit simply serves to add a little body to the cloth, without in any\r\nway sacrificing the design of the weaving. Long before the invention\r\nof even the earliest automatic textile machinery there were great\r\nnumbers of water-driven fulling mills, in which the woolen cloth was\r\npounded in fuller’s earth by wooden hammers. In those days the cloth\r\nwas felted into a stiff thick mass which would resist wear almost\r\nindefinitely, but which would hardly adapt itself to the requirements\r\nof modern tailoring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Steaming_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Raising_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cropping_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Pressing_]\r\n\r\nThe fulled piece is next made to revolve on a large drum set with\r\nteazle-heads. The object of this procedure is to open out the fibres,\r\nand the process is known as raising. In worsteds and fancy woolens,\r\nsuch as trouserings, raising is really nothing more than the brushing\r\nup of the loose fibres so that they may be cropped off, much as grass\r\nis cut on a lawn. This will of course have the effect of showing\r\nup the weave very plainly. In most woolens, however, the cloth is\r\nraised wet, and the teazle motion is more violent, so that the entire\r\nsurface is covered with a thick nap of brushed up fibres which\r\nentirely conceal the weave. This is often very desirable where coarse\r\nbacking threads are to be hidden, or where, for other reasons, a\r\nthick nap is desired, as for instance in rough overcoatings. There\r\nmay be several raisings and croppings, between which the material is\r\nboiled and pressed, all depending on the character of the face that\r\nis desired. In some cloths the finishing processes are exceedingly\r\ncomplicated, particularly where a smooth finish such as doeskin\r\nis sought. The variety of finishes is infinite and new ones are\r\nconstantly being invented, many of which are closely guarded trade\r\nsecrets. In most cases pressing completes the process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cropping_]\r\n\r\nWe have now followed both the combing and the clothing wools through\r\nthe process of manufacture into worsted and woolen yarns and cloths.\r\nAgain, let us emphasize that the relative amount of space devoted\r\nhere to the two industries is governed, not by their comparative\r\nimportance, but by what appeared to be the most concise method of\r\napproach. Many details, which loom up as tremendous problems to the\r\nmanufacturer, have necessarily been treated here with scant respect,\r\nand others have not even been mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. MOHAIR AND ALPACA\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mohair_]\r\n\r\nThere are two materials upon which we have not touched at all,\r\nalthough they are generally included in wool manufacture. Mohair is\r\nthe hair of the Angora goat, and has many characteristics of both\r\nhair and Mohair wool. These animals are native to Asia Minor, but are\r\nnow extensively raised in other parts of the world, notably in Africa\r\nand in this country. The hair averages about four inches in length,\r\nalthough it frequently grows much longer, is very smooth and fine,\r\nhas considerable tensile strength, low elasticity, and practically\r\nno felting property. It is used primarily in the manufacture of\r\nplush, such as is used in railroad carriages, and makes very durable\r\nmaterial. It is also woven into Palm Beach cloth, or mixed with\r\nworsted or cotton yarns in such fabrics as automobile tops.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Alpaca_]\r\n\r\nAlpaca is a similar fibre, obtained from an animal native to Bolivia\r\nand Peru. The fibre is finer than mohair, and a little more like\r\nwool. It comes in three natural colors; white, brown, and black,\r\nall of which are found on the same fleece. Alpaca is both light and\r\nsoft, and therefore lends itself admirably to the manufacture of thin\r\nlinings.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. KNITTING AND FELT MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Stockinette Frame_]\r\n\r\nWhereas most wool yarn is woven into cloth, there is also the\r\nknitting process, in which the individual threads are interlaced\r\ninto a regular fabric without warp and weft structure. The work is\r\nperformed on a sort of loom, called the stockinette frame, upon\r\nwhich the yarns are arranged in parallel order and uniform distances\r\napart. The actual knitting closely resembles hand knitting, and is\r\ndone entirely by automatic mechanism. A machine of this sort is\r\ncapable of turning out a great length of material in a short time,\r\nand the fabric has the fine ribbed character seen in ordinary knitted\r\ngoods. The article is soft, full, and elastic, but lacks the strength\r\nand firmness of woven fabrics. Stockinette cloths, sweaters, some\r\nunderwear, and hosiery are products of the knitting machine, and the\r\nknitting mills are important consumers of noils and low-grade wools.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Felt_]\r\n\r\nBesides being made into yarn, and woven or knit into goods, wool is\r\nalso compressed into felts of various kinds. Space unfortunately\r\nis lacking for the consideration of this subject here, although a\r\nconsiderable quantity of wool goes into felt manufacture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE ECONOMIC ASPECT\r\n\r\n\r\n1. FINANCIAL RISKS\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the industrial structure we have just outlined, it\r\nmight be well for us to glance briefly at its financial scaffolding.\r\nFrom the banker’s point of view there are many features which are\r\ndistinctive of the wool trade, and which exercise an important\r\nbearing upon the judgment of a credit risk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sheep Banks_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sheep Risks_]\r\n\r\nTo begin with the grower, we find here that in many instances the\r\nlarge raisers of sheep have built up their own banks. In Texas,\r\nfor instance, there are a considerable number of banks whose chief\r\nbusiness consists in financing the wool clips of their sections.\r\nOn the other extreme we have the small grower of the East, who is\r\nfrequently at the mercy of the local store-keeper. Where wool growing\r\nis practised on a large scale in this country the tendency is more\r\nand more to reduce the business to a scientifically standardized\r\nscale, in such a manner as is prevalent in Australia. The more this\r\nis done the more independent the grower becomes, and the easier it\r\nis for a bank to determine the strength of the individual risk. The\r\nsheep raiser has of course one primary asset, his flocks; and if he\r\nis compelled to borrow, the security behind his note rests upon his\r\nsheep. In making a loan to a sheep man a bank has to consider not\r\nonly the market value of the animals, but the conditions under which\r\nthey are being raised. Sheep are affected by droughts, for instance,\r\nand many flocks have been ravaged by predatory animals, or decimated\r\nby disease. Any one of these contingencies may at any moment destroy\r\nor depreciate the bank’s collateral, and for this reason borrowing of\r\nthis sort is confined very largely to banks situated in sheep-growing\r\nsections which specialize in this form of loan.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Grower’s Cost_]\r\n\r\nIt would be of great interest to figure the average cost of\r\nproduction per pound of wool to the grower, but, with the varying\r\nconditions encountered in different parts of the country and with\r\nsundry breeds, an accurate estimate can hardly be arrived at. Even\r\nthe cost of shearing is variously figured from ten to nearly thirty\r\ncents. Generally speaking, however, the grower needs very little\r\nfinancial assistance, because he is able to sell his entire clip for\r\ncash. The buyers representing merchants—or in a few cases, mills—are\r\nprepared to pay cash for their wool, and in some cases where they\r\nfeel sure of a rising market, often go so far as to buy the wool\r\non the sheep’s back before it is shorn. Provided the grower knows\r\nsomething about wool, and the existing demand, there is no reason\r\nwhy, from the proceeds of one clip, he should not be able to meet his\r\ncosts up to the time of the next shearing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Merchant_]\r\n\r\nThe merchant is up against a very different proposition. As we have\r\nseen, he buys for cash, and not only sells on credit, but carries a\r\nlarge proportion of what he buys for several months, before he can\r\ndispose of it. There are so many kinds of wool merchants that it is\r\nalmost impossible to make any general observations. One merchant,\r\nfor example, may specialize entirely in domestic wools; in that case\r\nhe would do all his buying in the spring months and would gradually\r\ndispose of his material, having first graded it, during the remainder\r\nof the year. Another house might do the bulk of its business in\r\nSouth American wools, which would mean a fall purchasing season.\r\nStill another would handle both domestic and South American, and\r\na fourth might import from all parts of the world, so that buying\r\nand selling would be going on continuously and at the same time\r\nthroughout the year. The credit requirements of the first two houses\r\nwould be an easier demand upon the bank than those of the latter,\r\nbut in all cases the judging of the risk involves certain primary\r\nconsiderations, each of which really necessitates the close study of\r\nthe individual case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Credit Risks_]\r\n\r\nA wool merchant’s business is largely based on his estimate of the\r\nfuture. There are no “future” markets for wool as there are for\r\ncotton and silk, and the wool dealer cannot therefore protect himself\r\nby hedging. Were it not for the fact that he assumes a risk which\r\nneither the grower nor, in most cases, the manufacturer is able\r\nto take, he could not maintain his position as the middleman. The\r\nmerchant’s buyer must, as we have seen, be able to judge the amount\r\nof shrinkage within a very small fraction, he must know the demand\r\nfor each quality of wool so that he may be sure not to pay more than\r\nhe can sell for, and, what is more, he must be able to forecast the\r\nfuture with a certain amount of accuracy in order to make his profit.\r\nFurthermore, the merchant must be constantly on his guard against\r\ndoing more business than his capital warrants, while at the same\r\ntime, unless he makes every dollar work, his business will in normal\r\ntimes fail to show him a profit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Merchant Manufacturers_]\r\n\r\nSome wool dealers have become considerably more than middlemen, and\r\nhave gone quite extensively into the first stages of manufacture.\r\nThis is particularly true of some of the large houses which of recent\r\nyears have established top manufacturing departments, and which\r\ntherefore sell a large proportion of their goods not as raw wool but\r\nas tops and noil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Brokers_]\r\n\r\nAlthough the dealers do the bulk of the commission work in\r\nconsignment sales, there are a great number of brokers whose function\r\nis primarily the buying and selling for account of others. These\r\nhouses usually operate with a limited capital, and are not extensive\r\nseekers of credit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mills_]\r\n\r\nSo far as the manufacturers, or mills of various sorts, are\r\nconcerned, there is one striking difference about the paper of woolen\r\nand worsted mills as against cotton mill notes which appear in the\r\nopen market; cotton mill paper, except in the case of the strongest\r\nmills, usually bears the endorsement of the commission house which\r\nsells the mill’s product, but this is not as a rule the case with\r\nwoolen and worsted mill paper. The reason is that a large number of\r\nthe wool manufacturing establishments sell direct to wholesalers and\r\njobbers, and have no close affiliation with a selling-house.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Trade Terms_]\r\n\r\nTrade terms vary a good deal. Raw wool is almost invariably sold for\r\ncash by the grower. Dealers make various terms to mills, the most\r\nusual being 1% ten days, sixty days net. The terms on which mills\r\nsell to jobbers also have a wide range; some sell thirty days net,\r\nsome 10% thirty days, others 7% four months.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. DEMAND AND SUPPLY\r\n\r\nSheep raising is, as we have seen, chiefly carried on on the\r\nborderlines of civilization. As civilized life encroaches upon the\r\npasture lands the flocks are driven gradually further and further\r\ninto hitherto uninhabited regions. The population of the world is\r\nsteadily increasing, and the available grazing acres are constantly\r\nbeing reduced as the world becomes more thickly populated. Also, as\r\nthe population increases, the demand for clothing and food increases,\r\nso that, on the face of it, it would seem that the production of wool\r\nwould decrease while the demand grew constantly larger. In a measure\r\nthis is true; but there are several factors which tend to arrest\r\nthis Malthusian spectre. In the first place, there are still vast\r\nareas of desert land which can be reclaimed for grazing purposes.\r\nIn the second place the growing of wool in most countries is as yet\r\npracticed on a very crude and consequently uneconomical scale. And,\r\nfinally, the use of shoddy and wool regained from rags, has only\r\nbegun to be developed. Nor is it true that sheep must necessarily be\r\nraised in uncultivated regions; England, with her closely settled\r\nsoil, supports about three-fifths as many sheep as the United States,\r\non an area of only 121,377 square miles, as against the 3,026,789\r\nsquare miles in this country.\r\n\r\nThe world’s total output of wool in 1921 is estimated at three\r\nbillion, three million pounds, as against two billion, eight hundred\r\nand ninety-four million pounds in 1918. The production of the 1921\r\ncrop was divided as follows: Europe 899 million pounds, Australia 718\r\nmillion pounds, South America 592 million pounds, Asia 327 million\r\npounds, North America 298 million pounds, Africa 169 million pounds.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the amount of wool produced and\r\nimported in the United States between the years of 1897 and 1922:\r\n\r\n\r\nWOOL PRODUCT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _U.

HISTORY\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Early Sericulture_]\r\n\r\nSilk owes its position as one of the three leading textiles to its\r\nqualities of strength, elasticity and beauty—in which respects it\r\nsurpasses all other fabrics. Its production dates far into antiquity;\r\nfor centuries China was the seat of the industry, guarding the secret\r\nmethods and processes with the utmost care. During the sixth and\r\nseventh centuries A. D. the secret began to leak out and sericulture\r\ngradually found root in the Near East and the Levant, whence it\r\nspread to Greece, Italy, France and Spain. Japan also took it up and\r\ndeveloped it to a very high point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Industry in America_]\r\n\r\nAttempts to establish the industry in America have been generally\r\nunsuccessful, high costs precluding the possibility of competing\r\nwith foreign conditions. In addition, the raising of raw silk has\r\nbeen built up principally in countries where there is a system of\r\nhome industry—a social and industrial system never developed in the\r\nUnited States. However, although America has never been a factor\r\nin the producing of the raw material, it has risen to a place of\r\nutmost importance in the manufacture of the finished textile. Immense\r\nquantities of raw silk are imported from abroad—principally Japan,\r\nItaly, and China—and its conversion into the finished products\r\nconstitutes a most important part of our industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. THE SILK WORM\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Names and Types of Silk Worms_]\r\n\r\nThe textile fibre known as silk is a filament secreted by one of two\r\ngeneral types of moth larvæ—the cultivated and the wild. The largest\r\nproportion is, of course, made up of the former, produced by the worm\r\nknown as the _Bombyx mori_, while the most common type of wild silk\r\nworm is called the Tussah. The name _Bombyx mori_ comes from the\r\nname of the family to which the silk worm belongs: the _Bombycidoe_\r\n(spinners), and _mori_, from the _morus multicaulis_ or mulberry\r\ntree, on the leaves of which it feeds. The species _Sericaria mori_,\r\nor silk worm of the mulberry, belongs to the generic class of\r\n_Lepidoptera_ or scaly-winged insects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bombyx Mori_]\r\n\r\nThe _Bombyx mori_, with which we are chiefly concerned, is divided\r\ninto other groups according to the cycle of reproduction. The annuals\r\nreproduce once a year, and sixty per cent of the silk worms belong\r\nto this class. The bivoltines reproduce twice a year, and the\r\npolyvoltines, several times during the year, the first crop being the\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Full Grown Worms_]\r\n\r\nThe study and development of the various phases through which\r\nthe silk worm passes, leading up to its production of the actual\r\nfilament, have been a subject of intense research in many parts of\r\nthe world for a great number of centuries. The present silk worm is\r\nnothing more than a highly specialized product of a long train of\r\nartificial cultivation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Stages of Growth_]\r\n\r\nThe cultivated silk worm passes through four changes in its life\r\nof two months, i.e., egg, larva, chrysalis (or pupa), and adult—a\r\ncream-white moth which is about one inch in length. The moths live\r\nonly a few days, during which mating takes place, and the female\r\nlays several hundred eggs; after about six months these eggs hatch\r\ninto worms. The latter pass through what are known as four “molts,”\r\nor shedding of the skin, before the worm matures, spins its cocoon,\r\nbecomes a chrysalis, and finally emerges as a moth. This, very\r\nbriefly, is the life history of the silk worm.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. MODERN SERICULTURE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Countries Producing Raw Silk_]\r\n\r\nSilk raising, or sericulture, has been a leading industry in\r\nJapan and China for a great many years, while the Near East and\r\nsuch countries as France and Italy have also played a part in\r\nthe industry—but to a lesser degree. A great deal of this work,\r\nparticularly in Japan and China, has been carried on as a home\r\nindustry, but with the growth of modern business methods more and\r\nmore of the silk raising has come into the hands of companies\r\noperating on a highly scientific basis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cocoonery_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Japanese Supervision_]\r\n\r\nAfter many years of experience and experimentation the breeding and\r\ncare of the silk worm has been put on a very technical and closely\r\nregulated schedule that minimizes the chances of loss by waste or\r\nthe spread of disease. In Japan the industry has been encouraged and\r\nfostered by the Government; a special division of the administration\r\nis devoted to its attention, and numerous organizations and\r\nassociations conduct experimental stations for research and study.\r\nIn fact since about the middle of the 19th century everything\r\npossible has been done to foster this highly profitable branch of the\r\ncountry’s industry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Modern Methods of Cultivation_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Hatching the Eggs_]\r\n\r\nThe merest outline of the modern methods of cultivation will show\r\nhow highly they have been developed. To begin with, the eggs are\r\nplaced on sheets of paper or muslin directly after they are laid.\r\nThese sheets are hung for a few days in a damp atmosphere, and then\r\nplaced in cold storage for about six months, the period of cold being\r\nadvantageous for later hatching, which is done by heat.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Growth of the Worms_]\r\n\r\nAfter hatching, the worm sheds its skin four times. The periods\r\nbetween the “molts,” or ages, vary with different silk worms, but the\r\ntotal process takes about a month. Worms of different ages are always\r\nkept separate, being held on large cloth trays which are carried in\r\ntiers along the walls of the rearing rooms. The cocooneries where\r\nbest results are obtained are quiet, spacious, well-ventilated rooms\r\nwhere an even temperature can be maintained. Each worm is kept\r\nabsolutely clean and has plenty of room, as overcrowding brings\r\ndisease. As a precaution mild fumigation is resorted to from time to\r\ntime. Heavy odors or smoke of any sort are not allowed, as these are\r\ndisturbing to the worms.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Feeding the Worms_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _The Mulberry Tree_]\r\n\r\nNourishment is, of course, a very important item for the growing\r\nworms, and the best form of food for the _Bombyx mori_ is the leaf\r\nof the white mulberry, which must be young, fresh and dry, but\r\nnever withered. For this purpose mulberry tree raising has become\r\nan important by-industry in itself. Three varieties are found,\r\nclassified according to the time of budding—early, medium and late.\r\nThe leaves, therefore, can be found in the correct condition for the\r\nvarious stages in the growth of the worm. The late budding trees\r\nare cultivated in more abundance, as the worms are larger at that\r\ntime and consume more leaves. The soil in which the trees grow is\r\nimportant, as it has been found that one which is rich in certain\r\nminerals provides leaves that keep the worms in better physical\r\ncondition. A cold winter followed by a warm spring develops the\r\nleaves well, and the condition of the leaves is one of the most\r\nimportant factors in the whole process.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Early Development_]\r\n\r\nCareful selection of the eggs is another matter of prime importance.\r\nWhen the leaves are almost ready, the eggs are brought out of cold\r\nstorage and subjected to heat for about a month before they hatch\r\nout. When the worm hatches it is about the diameter of a hair and\r\nless than three-fourths of an inch long. It gnaws a hole through the\r\nend of the egg from which it issues. Nourishment at first is taken by\r\nsucking the sap of the leaves, which are at this stage chopped into\r\nfine pieces; later the leaves are consumed without the necessity of\r\ntheir being chopped up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spinning the Cocoon_]\r\n\r\nThe development is very rapid, the worms consuming their own weight\r\ndaily. During this period, as has been stated, they shed their\r\nskins four times, and after the fourth molt—about one month after\r\nhatching—they have assumed their full size. From then on hunger\r\nlessens, restlessness grows, and the lifting of the fore part of\r\nthe body indicates the desire to climb and spin cocoons. For this\r\npurpose brush and twigs are provided in the trays, to which the worms\r\nattach themselves and begin the spinning process. The silk thread\r\nis expelled in a semi-liquid form from two openings underneath the\r\nmouth, hardening as it comes in contact with the air. The first\r\nthreads issued are coarse and rough, having the necessary strength\r\nto serve as supports and guys for the cocoon. Gradually the worm\r\nis enclosed in the cocoon after three days of continuous spinning,\r\nduring one of which it is visible and then slowly disappears, though\r\nit can be heard working inside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Worms Feeding_]\r\n\r\nThe worm wastes away as its silk glands are exhausted, and becomes a\r\nchrysalis, from which the moth escapes after fifteen to twenty days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Nest of Cocoons_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Cocoons for Breeding_]\r\n\r\nCocoons to be used for silk manufacture must be submitted to heat\r\nsoon after they are completed, in order to kill the chrysalis and\r\nprevent it from forcing its way out, thus breaking the fibres. A\r\ncertain proportion of the cocoons of each crop, however, is allowed\r\nto go through the natural process, for reproductive purposes. There\r\nis an active market in these breeding cocoons, particularly in Japan\r\nand China, and a large quantity are exported annually to Europe and\r\nthe Near East.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Construction of the Silk Thread_]\r\n\r\nThe female cocoon is oval and the male cocoon is peanut shaped. The\r\nsilk itself consists of two parts: fibroin (the silk fibre) and\r\nsericin (the gum). The thread is made up of two strands of fibre held\r\ntogether by the gum, and the length of thread in a single cocoon\r\nvaries from three hundred to fourteen hundred yards. The cocoons are\r\nwhite, yellowish, or greenish, but after the boiling process the\r\ncolor of the _Bombyx mori_ silk is pure white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Japanese Cocoon Market_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tussah and Wild Silk_]\r\n\r\nThe preceding description is concerned more particularly with the\r\nlatter type, from which the largest proportion of the world’s silk\r\nsupply is derived, but in a general way it applies to the other\r\ntypes also. The most important of these are the Tussah silk of India\r\nand China and the Japanese wild silk. The products are coarser and\r\nharsher than those of the _Bombyx mori_, and the natural color is\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A Japanese Filature_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nREELING\r\n\r\n\r\n1. HISTORY OF THE FILATURE\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Early Reeling and Twisting_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Vaucanson’s Filature_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Silk Manufacture in Europe_]\r\n\r\nThe next step in the production of silk is called reeling, and for\r\nthis purpose the modern filature has been developed. The actual\r\nexistence of reeling machines is by no means modern, however, for it\r\nis a well-known fact that the Chinese knew how to use raw silk as\r\nfar back as 5000 years ago. Old prints dating back 3000 years show\r\nthat the hand “reelers” then in use differed little in principle from\r\nthe highly developed filatures of today. Although China knew how to\r\nreel and twist silk for several thousand years, it was only in the\r\nthird, fourth, and fifth centuries A. D. that other countries, such\r\nas Japan and Eastern Europe, took it up. The first filatures were,\r\nof course, extremely simple, operated entirely by hand, and produced\r\na very coarse thread. Although a little progress was made during\r\nthe Middle Ages, the turning point came in 1750 when Vaucanson, a\r\nFrench engineer, invented the first real filature—which combined\r\nseveral reelers, giving the whole process more speed and turning out\r\na product of considerably better quality. This marked the beginning\r\nof Europe’s interest in what had so long been an exclusively\r\nOriental industry, and from then on the French, Italians and Spanish\r\nin particular took up the study of sericulture and the reeling and\r\nmanufacturing process. The result was to put the industry on a\r\nscientific basis which it had never reached in the East.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Reeling Basins_]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. PREPARING TO REEL\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_Stoving_”]\r\n\r\nThe reeling process is the first step in which machinery plays\r\nan important part. When the cocoons are ready they must first be\r\nsubmitted to the “stoving” process, or stifling, in which they are\r\nexposed to heat sufficient to kill the chrysalis inside. This is\r\nfollowed by further drying, after which the cocoons are shipped in\r\nbags to the filatures and may be kept indefinitely without injuring\r\nthe filament.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_Beating_”]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Waste Material_]\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary to reeling, the cocoons are immersed in boiling\r\nwater to soften the gum that holds the fibre together. While in\r\nthe water they are brushed with a coarse brush to remove the heavy\r\nouter strands of the cocoon—a process called “beating.” These outer\r\nstrands are usually too harsh and broken to be reeled, but are\r\nafterwards utilized as so-called waste which is used for spun-silk\r\nmanufacture.[4] This applies also to the innermost layers of the\r\ncocoon. About one-half of the thread on a cocoon actually finds its\r\nway into thrown silk. The remainder is “waste.” When, by brushing,\r\nthe true threads are reached it is possible to start reeling, and\r\nbarring occasional breaks these threads are continuous all the way\r\ndown to the chrysalis.\r\n\r\n[4] See Chapter IV. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. MODERN REELING METHODS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Reeling Basins_]\r\n\r\nWhile being reeled the cocoons are floated in basins of very hot\r\nwater, each basin feeding a reeling machine. A single cocoon strand\r\nis too fine to use commercially, so several are taken at a time,\r\nvarying from three to seven or eight according to the size of thread\r\ndesired. The size used in this country most extensively is known as\r\n13/15 deniers and is reeled from six or seven cocoons. During the\r\nreeling the water is kept at about 60° C., but if the cocoons are\r\nvery dry a higher temperature is required. A heavy smoke issues from\r\nthe basins and not only humidifies the room but also penetrates the\r\nsilk, rendering it very gummy and hard. This is overcome by the use\r\nof steam-heated tubes running over and around the machines.\r\n\r\nEach reeling machine and basin is in charge of a girl who is\r\nresponsible for its operation and for the reeling of thread of\r\ncorrect size. She must keep careful watch that the filament comes off\r\nthe cocoons steadily and that all breaks are immediately taken care\r\nof, exhausted cocoons being replaced by new ones at the proper time.\r\nIn many filatures each girl is charged with so many cocoons and must\r\nturn in a proportionate amount of reeled silk at the end of the day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Twisting_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Human Element_]\r\n\r\nThe twisting operation is an important part of the reeling process,\r\nfor the raw silk threads, being composed of parallel cocoon\r\nfilaments, cohering only by their natural gum, would, unless twisted,\r\nmat up and become unworkable. Various methods are used to obtain\r\nthis torque, the general idea in each case being to run the separate\r\ncocoon threads through small rings or eyes and then unite them in one\r\nthread large enough to reel. In spite of the many mechanical devices\r\nand improvements brought out in the last few years, the success\r\nof the reeling operation still is dependent on the reeling girl’s\r\nability and care. It is particularly important that she be able to\r\njudge the number of cocoons of a certain size and texture needed to\r\nmake a thread of the required denier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rereeling Room_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Testing the Skeins_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Color of Raw Silk_]\r\n\r\nThe raw silk is reeled on travellers in hanks known as skeins and\r\nvarying from 50 to 100 grams in weight, which are taken off by the\r\nreeling girl and the ends of the thread tied up to facilitate the\r\nwork at the mill. Before leaving the filature it is also subjected\r\nto critical tests and examinations for size, winding, cleanliness,\r\nirregularities, etc. The color of raw silk as it comes off the\r\ncocoon and is reeled into skeins is either white or yellow, though\r\nsome sorts have a brownish or greenish tinge. Tussah silks have a\r\nbrownish-yellow color. The coloring matter in the cultivated silks is\r\nonly in the gum and boils out with it, but the color in the tussah is\r\nin the fibre, rendering it very difficult to bleach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _“Books” of Raw Silk Skeins_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Reeling Wild Silk_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Waste Silk_]\r\n\r\nTussah, or wild silk, is not generally reeled by the wet reel\r\nprocess, as the cocoons are apt to be closed up at each end by gum.\r\nIn China this gum is softened by burying the cocoons in manure\r\ninstead of immersing them in hot water. This is known as dry\r\nreeling. It very often happens that the tussah cocoons are unfit for\r\nreeling, due to being pierced or tangled. Silk from these imperfect\r\ncocoons is again classed as “waste,” along with the frisons, or\r\noutside and inmost layers of the cultivated cocoons, which, as has\r\nbeen stated, are used to make spun silk. In this country waste silk\r\nis often called schappe, although strictly speaking this name should\r\nonly be applied to waste silk degummed by the French process of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Baling_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Picul Bale_]\r\n\r\nThe raw silk, having been reeled and twisted into skeins, is next\r\nmarked and tied together in bundles of skeins known as “books” each\r\nbearing the mark or “chop” of its grade. These are packed in bales\r\nfor shipment, the weight of the bales varying in different countries.\r\nIn Japan and China they are called picul bales and weigh 133⅓ pounds.\r\nItalian silks, on the other hand, are packed in shipping bales of\r\nabout 200 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. SOURCES OF RAW SILK\r\n\r\nOf the countries producing raw silk, Japan and China occupy the\r\nleading positions by a large margin, the former contributing roughly\r\none half of the world’s supply, and the latter about one third. Italy\r\nranks a poor third with about one tenth, and France, the Near East,\r\nIndia, Spain and the Balkans contribute the balance.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Japan_]\r\n\r\nAlthough the greater part of the raw silk produced in the various\r\ncountries is exported for manufacture abroad, a certain percentage is\r\nretained for home spinning and weaving. It is estimated that about\r\n65 per cent of the Japanese output is exported, approximately 90 per\r\ncent. of which goes to the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _China_]\r\n\r\nIn China over one half of the output is held for domestic\r\nconsumption, the remainder being divided about equally between Europe\r\nand America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Italy_]\r\n\r\nThe Italian raw silk—a very high quality product—finds its largest\r\nmarket in France, principally in the city of Lyons, the silk center\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMARKETING RAW SILK\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

The speculative\r\nelement is very active and its influence is often felt extensively\r\nthroughout all phases of the industry. On several occasions it has\r\nbeen necessary to close the exchange to avert real disaster after\r\nthe quotations have been manipulated to an unbelievable extent.\r\nDuring the last few years the Japanese Government and various silk\r\norganizations have, by law and regulation, succeeded in improving\r\nthis situation to a very great degree, and the benefit has been felt\r\nthroughout the industry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Conditioned Weight_]\r\n\r\nRaw silk is sold by weight—in Yokohama, by net weight, that is,\r\nless wrappings, etc. Of recent years in most countries it has\r\nbeen the custom to deal by conditioned weight, and as a result\r\nthe conditioning process has become an important side line in the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. CONDITIONING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Invoice Weight_]\r\n\r\nConditioning is desirable principally on account of the fact that raw\r\nsilk absorbs considerable moisture. A careless buyer may find after\r\ndelivery that he has purchased more water than he has silk. To avoid\r\nthis possibility, Asiatic and European markets in particular have\r\nadopted the conditioned weight basis—absolute dry weight plus 11 per\r\ncent moisture. Quotations are often given on invoice weight, which is\r\nconditioned weight plus a 2% margin for variation.\r\n\r\nA conditioning house, besides examining for weight, also conducts\r\nnumerous other tests necessary to conditioned silk. The main\r\nfactors taken into consideration, besides weight, are size, color,\r\ncleanliness, boil-off, winding strength, elasticity, and general\r\nuniformity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Weight_]\r\n\r\nAs regards size, the unit is the denier, an ancient French weight\r\nequal to .05 gram; the size is measured by the weight in deniers of\r\n450 meters of the thread. As previously stated, the 13/15 denier\r\nsize is the standard used in the United States, although the larger\r\nand smaller grades are dealt in to some extent for special types of\r\nproducts. Size is always given as averaging between certain deniers\r\n(such as 13 to 15) as it is impossible to attain absolute accuracy in\r\nreeling, and slight variations cannot be avoided, either within the\r\nbales or within the skeins themselves.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Color_]\r\n\r\nThe color test is concerned merely with uniformity in shade, which\r\nmakes accurate dyeing possible. The cultivated silks are either pure\r\nwhite or yellow, according to the variety of cocoon from which they\r\nare derived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_Boil off_”]\r\n\r\nThe term “boil off” refers to the amount or percentage of gum on the\r\nfilament. As explained before, the individual strands of fibre adhere\r\ntogether through a gummy substance secreted by the worm. The amount\r\nfound in the reeled silk varies with different kinds from 10 to 25\r\nper cent by weight—which is brought down to a minimum by the boiling\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Winding Strength_]\r\n\r\nWinding strength is measured by the breaks that occur in winding. In\r\nthis country the test is based on the number of breaks occurring in\r\n30 or more skeins wound at the rate of about 120 yards per minute.\r\nThis test is extremely important since a weak thread can do much to\r\nhinder an efficient re-reeling process, inasmuch as each break stops\r\nthe machine and must be tied by the operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. GRADING AND QUOTATIONS\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Classification_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Difficulties in Grading_]\r\n\r\nThe question of classification of raw silk for market and the\r\nvarious terms used for its purchase and sale is a complicated one.\r\nStandardization has been sought after for a good many years and\r\ncommittees both here and abroad have studied the problem on various\r\noccasions—but without entirely satisfactory results. The chief source\r\nof trouble appears to lie the many types of variation that may occur,\r\nnot only on account of the great number of qualities required in the\r\nproduct, but also due to the varying conditions under which the silk\r\nis produced. In the early days of the industry, when farm production\r\nwas the chief source of supply, particularly in Japan and China,\r\nsatisfactory grading was almost an impossibility. However, now that\r\nsericulture and reeling has come more and more into the hands of the\r\nlarge companies and filatures, a greater degree of standardization\r\ncan be reached.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Quotations_]\r\n\r\nThe following is an actual example of a recent quotation list in the\r\nNew York market as it appeared in a commercial paper:—\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPAN\r\n\r\n(Ninety Days’ Basis, 13-15 Denies)\r\n\r\n  Kansai    Double Extra Cracks     $6.15 @ $6.20\r\n  Kansai    Double Extra “A”         6.05 @  6.10\r\n  Kansai    Double Extra “B”         6.00 @  6.07\r\n  Kansai    Best Extra               5.95 @  6.02\r\n  Kansai    Extra                    5.90 @  5.97\r\n  Kansai    Best No. 1 to Extra      5.87 @  5.95\r\n  Kansai    Best No. 1               5.85 @  5.92\r\n  Kansai    No. 1                    5.82 @  5.90\r\n  Sinshiu   No. 1                    5.77 @  5.85\r\n\r\n\r\nCANTON\r\n\r\n(Ninety Days’ Basis)\r\n\r\n  King Seng gr. 14-16            $6.40\r\n  Favorite—Double Extra 20-22     6.00\r\n  Favorite—Double Extra 22-26     5.90\r\n\r\n\r\nSHANGHAI\r\n\r\n(Ninety Days’ Basis)\r\n\r\n  CHINA STEAM FILATURE\r\n  Gold Double Deer, new crop              $7.50\r\n  Geranium, new crop                       7.25\r\n  Comet                                    6.60\r\n  Tsatless Blue Dragon and Flying Horse    5.60\r\n      Black Lion, No. 1-2                  5.10\r\n  Tussah—Best chops                        3.90\r\n\r\n\r\nITALIAN\r\n\r\n  Grand Extra Classical    $7.00\r\n  Extra Classical           6.80\r\n  Best Classical            6.70\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RAW SILK PRICES\r\n  NEW YORK MARKET\r\n  1913-1923\r\n\r\n  Courtesy of The Silk Association of America\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Kansai and Sinshiu_]\r\n\r\nIn the Japanese classification, Kansai and Sinshiu originally\r\nindicated the section of Japan where the silk originated, but of\r\nrecent years they have come to mean hard or soft natured silks\r\nrespectively.

We now come to the\r\nmechanical phases of the industry, by which raw silk is made first\r\ninto yarn and then into fabric. Whereas, in the case of cotton and\r\nwool, we have seen that yarn is manufactured by various modifications\r\nof the spinning process, this is not true in the case of silk.\r\nThe spinning process is here supplanted by an operation known as\r\n“throwing,” and is resorted to only in the manufacture of yarn from\r\nthe various kinds of silk waste.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. THROWN SILK\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Necessity for Throwing_]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary raw silk, as it comes from the filature and is sold\r\nin the market, is composed of from two to eight filaments adhering\r\ntogether by virtue of the natural gum secreted by the worm.\r\nThis thread is too thin and delicate for many uses and so must\r\nbe submitted to further twisting and doubling—a process called\r\n“throwing.” It must be borne in mind, however, that there are several\r\ntypes of fabrics in which raw silk is used without going through the\r\nthrowing operation. This is usually the case, for example, with the\r\nwarp threads for crepes, charmeuse, and messaline.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_Throwsters_”]\r\n\r\nAlthough some of the larger silk mills have their own departments for\r\nthis process, as a general rule it is done by independent concerns\r\nknown as “throwsters”—who specialize in this particular operation.\r\nMachinery of a very complicated and accurate type is necessary,\r\ncapable of operating at very high speed. It has been found that the\r\ninvestment called for to equip such a mill is too large in most cases\r\nto allow the manufacturers to incorporate this operation in their\r\nfactories, particularly if it happens that the spindles are not\r\nfully employed during the whole of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Throwing Machines_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Organzine and Tram_]\r\n\r\nThere are two main classes of thrown silk—organzine and tram—the\r\nformer has a heavy twist and is used for the warp; while the latter\r\nis given only a light twist and is used for filling. Within these two\r\ngeneral types there are many special grades, according to the type\r\nof material for which they are to be used, such as crepe, chiffon,\r\nsewing thread, floss silk, embroidery silk, etc.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Soaking the Raw Silk_]\r\n\r\nThe raw silk as it comes to the throwing mill is done up in books\r\nof skeins and packed in bales, as described in a previous chapter.\r\nThe skeins, after being weighed and examined, are first soaked for\r\nabout twelve hours in warm soapy water, which softens the natural\r\ngum, after which they are thoroughly dried. This, of course, reduces\r\nthe moisture content below the customary 11 per cent, which is later\r\nrestored by natural absorption.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Winding_]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the actual throwing is the winding of the thread on\r\nbobbins. The skeins are put on swifts—a light type of reel—and wound\r\nat a very high rate of speed on the proper size of bobbin. It is here\r\nthat the winding strength of the silk meets its severest test, for\r\nconstant breaks during the winding involve considerable expense when\r\nspeed is such an important factor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Twisting_]\r\n\r\nThe bobbins of silk are next taken to the twister, which combines\r\ntwo or more strands and gives the thread the necessary amount of\r\ntwist for the special type that is desired. In the case of tram a\r\nvery light twist is given, about two or three turns to the inch. For\r\norganzine the single threads are first given sixteen turns to an inch\r\nin one direction, then doubled and twisted fourteen turns in the\r\nother direction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Crepe_]\r\n\r\nTwisting is the basis of the manufacture of the various kinds of\r\ncrepe. The filling or tram used is given a very hard twist, about\r\nsixty-five turns to the inch—either in right or left-hand direction.\r\nThese threads are later woven alternately and so produce the crinkled\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThrown silk is classified in a similar way to raw silk, except that\r\nusually market quotations on thrown silks mention not only the\r\nclassification but also the purpose for which it is to be used (tram\r\nor organzine), the size in deniers, the number of threads and twists\r\nto the inch.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. SPUN SILK\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Spinning Waste Silk_]\r\n\r\nThe above processes refer only to throwing of raw silk. In the case\r\nof waste, schappe, frisons, etc., an entirely different method must\r\nbe used, comprising a series of operations very similar to the\r\ncarding, combing and spinning of wool.[8] The gum, of which silk\r\nwaste contains a very large proportion, must first be boiled off in\r\na hot soapy bath or allowed to ferment in vats, the latter method\r\nbeing used more generally in Europe. After degumming, the waste\r\nsilk is next washed and dried and allowed to absorb the 11 per cent\r\nmoisture content, as in the case of the thrown silk. This is followed\r\nby picking, combing, and dressing to remove any dirt or other foreign\r\nmatter and to separate the fibres and arrange them in parallel order.\r\n\r\nThe silk is next separated into short laps, then drawn out into thin\r\nslivers by means of drawing frames, and thoroughly combed to make the\r\nfibres smooth and uniform. These slivers are finally made suitable\r\nfor winding on bobbins by being passed through roving frames. Then\r\nfollows the actual spinning process, which twists the roving into\r\nyarn. Different types of yarn are produced by varying the amount of\r\ntwist and the number of strands used. Single yarn is made by twisting\r\na single strand on itself, while for 2-ply, two yarns are twisted\r\ntogether, and so forth, as in the case of cotton or wool.\r\n\r\nAfter being cleaned and examined, the yarn is wound into skeins of\r\nabout 5 ounces.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Uses of Spun Silk_]\r\n\r\nThe principal use of spun silk is in mixed fabrics, in conjunction\r\nwith wool, cotton, or raw silk, the spun silk thread generally being\r\nused as filling rather than warp. The better grades are made into\r\nvelvet and plush and various types of knit goods. Although high\r\nquality spun silk often has the strength and wearing quality of\r\nthrown silk, it never can compete with the latter in regard to lustre.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Sizing_]\r\n\r\nSpun silk is described as to size in one of two general ways. In the\r\nEnglish system the number of the yarn is the number of hanks of 840\r\nyards weighing a pound, with a second number indicating the ply.\r\nThus, size “20-2” would designate a 2-ply yarn, a pound of which\r\ncontained 16,800 yards. The French system is more or less on the same\r\nprinciple, the main difference being that the number of the yarn\r\nindicates the thousands of metres weighing a kilogram.\r\n\r\n[8] See Part Two, Page 74 to Page 78 for details of spinning.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. MARKETING THROWN AND SPUN SILK\r\n\r\nThrown and spun silk are bought and sold in very much the same way\r\nas is raw silk, although the market is not as extensive nor is the\r\nvolume of trading as large. The following tables of quotations are\r\nfrom a recent silk journal. A comparison with the quotations given\r\nin Chapter III will show the appreciation in value of the various\r\ngradings through the throwing and spinning processes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROWN SILK\r\n\r\n  ORGANZINE\r\n    Double Extra Crack                               $7.30\r\n    Double Extra                                      7.20\r\n    Extra                                             7.10\r\n  TRAM\r\n    Extra                                            $6.85\r\n    Best No. 1                                        6.75\r\n    Kansai No. 1                                      6.70\r\n    Japan Crepe Twist, 2 thread, 75 turns             7.80\r\n    Japan Crepe Twist, 3 and 4 thread, 60-65 turns    7.25\r\n    Canton Crepe Twist, 3 and 4 thread, 60-65 turns   7.20\r\n    Hosiery Tram                                      6.75\r\n\r\n\r\nSPUN SILK\r\n\r\n          2% net 30 days\r\n   6/2        $4.25\r\n  10/2         4.35\r\n  20/2         4.75\r\n  30/2         5.15\r\n  40/2         5.35\r\n  50/2         5.50\r\n  60/1         4.45\r\n  60/2         5.60\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Twisting on New Warp Threads_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Modern British Loom_\r\n\r\nShown at the British Empire Exposition\r\n\r\nWembley, 1924]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Imports_]\r\n\r\nAlthough far from approaching raw silk, the importations of silk\r\nwaste to this country reach quite substantial figures, as the\r\nfollowing table shows:\r\n\r\n          Raw Silk      Waste Silk\r\n  1920   30,058,374      9,400,985\r\n  1921   45,355,095      6,849,369\r\n  1922   50,711,826      7,638,317\r\n  1923   49,505,581     12,101,420\r\n\r\n  (Courtesy of Silk Association of America)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nWEAVING AND FINISHING\r\n\r\n\r\n1. WEAVING\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of thrown and spun silk into the finished material,\r\nwhether by weaving or knitting, varies with the different types of\r\nfabric desired. But the several processes are based on the same\r\ngeneral principle and are very similar to those used for cotton\r\nand wool. To avoid repetition we would refer to Pages twenty-six\r\nto twenty-nine and Pages thirty-one to thirty-five, where full\r\ndescriptions will be found.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. FINISHING\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Boiling Off_]\r\n\r\nThe first step in the finishing of fabrics is dyeing—unless it has\r\nalready been done before weaving. A considerable proportion of silk\r\nis dyed in skein or yarn form before weaving, but in either case the\r\nmethods of dyeing are practically the same. Preparatory to dyeing it\r\nis necessary to boil off the natural gum by means of hot soap baths.\r\nIf the silk is to be dyed in dark colors a considerable amount of the\r\ngum is allowed to remain. Such silk is known as souple silk and is\r\nused principally for filling. If all the gum has been removed, it is\r\ncalled bright silk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Bleaching_]\r\n\r\nAll silk, after boiling off, should be nearly pure white. Raw silk,\r\nas mentioned in a previous chapter, is often bright yellow, but as\r\nthis color is entirely in the gum, it is lost by boiling off. In the\r\ncase of uneven coloration in the raw silk, it is necessary to resort\r\nto bleaching before dyeing in order to get uniformity in the finished\r\nproduct. This applies particularly to wild silks, such as Tussah,\r\nwhich are bleached by being placed in an air-tight room filled with\r\na chemical preparation, such as sulphur gas or sodium or hydrogen\r\nperoxide. A further washing and drying is then necessary before the\r\nskeins or goods can be dyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Jacquard Loom_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Dyeing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Mordant Dyes_]\r\n\r\nThere is no standard dye used for silk, some manufacturers preferring\r\none type and others, another. It may be said, however, that as a\r\ngeneral rule silk is dyed by the direct method, without the use of\r\nan intermediate or mordant agent as in the case of cotton. This is\r\nmade possible through the natural absorptive powers of silk fibre.\r\nMordant dyes are sometimes used, it is true, salts of tin or iron\r\nbeing employed as the agent; but this method is useful principally\r\nwhen it is desired to weight the silk and restore what was lost in\r\nboiling off. As this loss generally amounts to about 20 or 25 per\r\ncent and as raw silk is sold by weight, it is easy to see that this,\r\nunless recovered in some way, would reduce the manufacturer’s profit\r\nconsiderably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Winding Thrown Silk into Skeins for Dyeing_]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Weighting Silk_]\r\n\r\nThe process of weighting silk has been greatly abused, as it is\r\ncomparatively simple to adulterate it, without discovery, to such\r\nan extent that the properties of the fibre are seriously impaired.\r\nWeighted silk never has the strength or wearing quality of the\r\nunadulterated product. However, a certain amount of weighting—to\r\nrestore a part of the degumming loss—is generally recognized as\r\nlegitimate, although the percentage permissible is often a matter for\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nBoth skein and piece silk are dyed by being immersed in vats\r\ncontaining the hot dye solution. The silk is run over rollers\r\nwhich insure even coloration throughout. After dyeing it is dried,\r\nstretched on a tenter frame and then submitted to dry heat which\r\nsets the dye and adds luster to the silk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Printing_]\r\n\r\nPrinting is also used for coloring and pattern effects in very much\r\nthe same way as for cotton goods. After printing the goods are\r\nsubmitted to a dry steam heat which sets the colors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Finishing_]\r\n\r\nBeyond dyeing or printing, silk goods require very little finishing\r\nother than calendaring by passing through rollers. Some types of\r\nfabric require softening and others, hardening—accomplished in a\r\nvariety of ways too numerous to describe. Many of these are secret\r\nprocesses perfected and patented by individual companies. A multitude\r\nof different effects can be obtained by these various treatments of\r\nthe surface of the goods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL SILK\r\n\r\n\r\n1. EARLY DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Chardonnet_]\r\n\r\nThe discovery of what is known as “artificial silk” is generally\r\nattributed to a Frenchman, Count Hilaire de Chardonnet, who after\r\nmany years of research and experimentation, between 1840 and 1890,\r\nfinally perfected a fibre that possessed the necessary qualities for\r\npractical weaving. He introduced his discovery to the public in 1891\r\nat the Paris Exposition, and in addition to winning the “Grand Prix”\r\nwas also made a knight of the Legion of Honor in recognition of his\r\ncontribution to science and industry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Further Development_]\r\n\r\nSince that time others have contributed to the development of the new\r\nfibre and discovered other methods of production—all, however, based\r\non the same general principle as the Chardonnet process. Despaisses\r\nand Panly, two Frenchmen, and Stearn, Cross and Bevan, Englishmen,\r\nare the outstanding names in this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. VARIOUS PROCESSES\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Use of Cellulose_]\r\n\r\nAll the processes that have met with any success are based on the use\r\nof cellulose in some form, as a foundation. The two sources that have\r\nproved most successful are wood-pulp and cotton and it may be said\r\nthat the bulk of the artificial silk on the market comes from one or\r\nthe other of these two raw materials.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Chardonnet Process_]\r\n\r\nThe Chardonnet process uses cotton as its base. It is first bleached,\r\nthen by chemical treatment is changed to nitro-cellulose, which is\r\ndissolved in alcohol and ether and thus made ready for “spinning.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Viscose Process_]\r\n\r\nThe Viscose process, which has made great strides in recent years,\r\nmakes use of a pure grade of sulphite wood-pulp. This pulp is in\r\nsheet form and is first treated with a solution of caustic soda, then\r\nshredded very fine and put through several more chemical treatments,\r\nfinally being dissolved in water preparatory to the “spinning.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_Spinning_”]\r\n\r\nIn both of the above methods the production of the thread is the\r\nsame. The solution, whether it be based on cotton or wood-pulp, is\r\nforced through minute holes and comes out in a thread-like stream,\r\nwhich solidifies when subjected to a setting bath. It is then washed,\r\ndried, and put through processes, such as twisting, reeling, etc.,\r\nvery similar to those which natural silks undergo.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. USES OF ARTIFICIAL SILK\r\n\r\nThe uses of artificial silk are many and are not entirely confined to\r\ncombinations with other textiles. Of recent years the knitting trade\r\nhas adopted it extensively, particularly in hosiery, sweater and\r\nunderwear manufacture. In weaving, it has proven very successful in\r\ncombination with silk or cotton. Large quantities are used in ribbon,\r\nelectric cord covering, yarns, threads, etc. It is generally felt\r\nthat the new fibre does not directly compete with or replace natural\r\nsilk, but rather occupies its own place in the trade on the same\r\nbasis as the other textiles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Growth of the Industry_]\r\n\r\nIt has only been during the last fifteen years that artificial silk\r\nhas been a very important factor commercially, although for a few\r\nyears before that time, small quantities were produced in Europe.\r\nSince about 1910 its use has been steadily growing in this country,\r\nthe importations from Europe increasing in 1912 from about one and\r\none-half million pounds to nearly three million pounds in 1914. Since\r\n1910 domestic production has also become a factor in the market\r\nand numerous factories have been established, the figures for 1923\r\nshowing about 33,000,000 pounds output. It is estimated that in 1922\r\nthe combined importations and domestic production amounted to around\r\n20,000,000 pounds, about 50% of the total consumption of natural silk\r\nfor that year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _U. S. Production_]\r\n\r\nThe following figures show the production of artificial silk in the\r\nUnited States in 1913 and between 1920 and 1923:\r\n\r\n  1913    1,566,000 pounds\r\n  1920    8,000,000   ”\r\n  1921   15,000,000   ”\r\n  1922   24,000,000   ”\r\n  1923   33,000,000   ”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPORTS OF RAW SILK\r\n\r\nINTO THE\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA\r\n\r\nCALENDAR YEAR 1914-1923\r\n\r\nCourtesy of The Silk Association of America]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE BANK, INC.
