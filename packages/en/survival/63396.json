Trimble\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Plains! The words alone create a sense of space and a feeling\r\nof destiny—a challenge. But what exactly is this special part of Western\r\nAmerica that contains so much of our history? How did it come to be? Why\r\nis it different?\r\n\r\nGeographically, the Great Plains is an immense sweep of country; it\r\nreaches from Mexico far north into Canada and spreads out east of the\r\nRocky Mountains like a huge welcome mat. So often maligned as a drab,\r\nfeatureless area, the Great Plains is in fact a land of marked contrasts\r\nand limitless variety: canyons carved into solid rock of an arid land by\r\nthe waters of the Pecos and the Rio Grande; the seemingly endless\r\ngrainfields of Kansas; the desolation of the Badlands; the beauty of the\r\nBlack Hills.\r\n\r\nBefore it was broken by the plow, most of the Great Plains from the\r\nTexas panhandle northward was treeless grassland. Trees grew only along\r\nthe floodplains of streams and on the few mountain masses of the\r\nnorthern Great Plains. These lush prairies once were the grazing ground\r\nfor immense herds of bison, and the land provided a bountiful life for\r\nthose Indians who followed the herds. South of the grasslands, in Texas,\r\nshrubs mixed with the grasses: creosote bush along the valley of the\r\nPecos River; mesquite, oak, and juniper to the east.\r\n\r\nThe general lack of trees suggests that this is a land of little\r\nmoisture, as indeed it is. Nearly all of the Great Plains receives less\r\nthan 24 inches of rainfall a year, and most of it receives less than 16\r\ninches. This dryness and the strength of sunshine in this area, which\r\nlies mostly between 2,000 and 6,000 feet above sea level, create the\r\nsemiarid environment that typifies the Great Plains. But it was not\r\nalways so. When the last continental glacier stood near its maximum\r\nextent, some 12,000-14,000 years ago, spruce forest reached southward as\r\nfar as Kansas, and the Great Plains farther south was covered by\r\ndeciduous forest. The trees retreated northward as the ice front\r\nreceded, and the Great Plains has been a treeless grassland for the last\r\n8,000-10,000 years.\r\n\r\nFor more than half a century after Lewis and Clark crossed the country\r\nin 1805-6, the Great Plains was the testing ground of frontier\r\nAmerica—here America grew to maturity (fig. 1). In 1805-7, explorer\r\nZebulon Pike crossed the south-central Great Plains, following the\r\nArkansas River from near Great Bend, Kans., to the Rocky Mountains. In\r\nlater years, Santa Fe traders, lured by the wealth of New Mexican trade,\r\nfollowed Pike’s path as far as Bents Fort, Colo., where they turned\r\nsouthwestward away from the river route. Those pioneers who later\r\ncrossed the plains on the Oregon Trail reached the Platte River near the\r\nplace that would become Kearney, Nebr., by a nearly direct route from\r\nIndependence, Mo., and followed the Platte across the central part of\r\nthe Great Plains.\r\n\r\nAlthough these routes may have seemed long and tedious to those dusty\r\ntravelers, they provided relatively easy access to the Rocky Mountains\r\nand had a continuous supply of fresh water, an absolute necessity in\r\nthese plains. The minds of those frontiersmen surely were occupied with\r\nthe dangers and demands of the moment—and with dreams—but the time\r\nafforded by the slow pace of travel also gave them ample opportunity for\r\nthought about the origins of their surroundings.\r\n\r\nToday’s traveler, who has less time for contemplation, races past a\r\nchanging kaleidoscope of landscape. The increased awareness created by\r\nthis rapidity of change perhaps is even more likely to stimulate\r\nquestions about the origin of this landscape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 1.—Index map of the Great Plains showing route of\r\nLewis and Clark and the Santa Fe and Oregon Trails._]\r\n\r\nFor instance, the westbound traveler on Interstate Highway 70 traverses\r\nnearly a thousand miles of low, rounded hills after leaving the\r\nAppalachians; the rolling landscape is broken only by a few flat areas\r\nwhere glacial ice or small lakes once stood. Suddenly, near Salina,\r\nKans., the observant traveler senses a difference in the landscape.\r\nInstead of rounded hills, widely or closely spaced, he sees on the\r\nskyline flat surfaces, or remnants of flat surfaces. As he climbs gently\r\nwestward these broken horizontal lines stand etched against the sky.\r\nAbout 35 miles west of Salina he finds himself on a broad, flat plateau,\r\nwhere seemingly he can see forever. True, in places he descends into\r\nstream valleys, but only briefly, for he soon climbs back onto the flat\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThis plateau surface continues for 300 miles to the west—to within 100\r\nmiles of the abrupt front of the Rocky Mountains. East-flowing streams,\r\nsuch as the Smoky Hill, the Saline, the Solomon, and the Republican\r\nRivers and their tributary branches, have cut their valleys into this\r\nsurface, but these valleys become increasingly shallow and disappear\r\nentirely near the western rim of the plateau in eastern Colorado.\r\n\r\nThe distant peaks of the Rockies are seen for the first time as the\r\ntraveler approaches the escarpment that forms the western edge of this\r\ngreat plateau. After crossing the escarpment near Limon, Colo., he\r\nbegins the long gentle descent to Denver, on the South Platte River near\r\nthe foot of the mountains that loom so awesomely ahead. He has crossed\r\nthe Great Plains. The distances have been great, but the contrasts have\r\nbeen marked.\r\n\r\nHad our traveler selected a different route, either to the north or\r\nsouth, he would have found even greater contrasts, for the Great Plains\r\nhas many parts, each with its own distinctive aspect. Why should such\r\ndiverse landscapes be considered parts of the Great Plains? What are\r\ntheir unifying features? And what created this landscape? Has it always\r\nbeen this way? If not, when was it formed? How was it formed?\r\n\r\nWe will look here at some of the answers to those questions. The history\r\nof events that produced the landscape of the Great Plains is interpreted\r\nboth from the materials that compose the landforms and from the\r\nlandforms themselves. As we will see, all landforms are the result of\r\ngeologic processes in action. These processes determine not only the\r\nsize and shape of the landforms, but also the materials of which they\r\nare made. These geologic processes, which form and shape our Earth’s\r\nsurface, are simply the inevitable actions of the restless interior of\r\nthe Earth and of the air, water, and carbon dioxide of the atmosphere,\r\naided by gravity and solar heating (or lack of it). They all have helped\r\nsculpture the fascinating diversity of the part of our land we call the\r\nGreat Plains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       WHAT IS THE GREAT PLAINS?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States has been subdivided into physiographic regions that,\r\nalthough they have great diversity within themselves, are distinctly\r\ndifferent from each other (fig. 2).\r\n\r\nFrom the Rocky Mountains on the west to the Appalachians on the east,\r\nthe interior of our country is a vast lowland (see cover) known as the\r\nInterior Plains. These plains are bounded on the south by a region of\r\nInterior Highlands, consisting of the Ozark Plateaus and the Ouachita\r\nprovince, and by the Coastal Plain. In the Great Lakes region, the\r\nInterior Plains laps onto the most ancient part of the continent, the\r\nSuperior Upland. West of the Great Lakes it extends far to the north\r\ninto Canada. Certainly the Rocky Mountains are distinctly different from\r\nthe region to the east, which is the Great Plains. The Great Plains,\r\nthen, is the western part of the great Interior Plains. The Rocky\r\nMountains form its western margin. But what determines its eastern\r\nmargin?\r\n\r\nDuring the Pleistocene Epoch or Great Ice Age, huge glaciers formed in\r\nCanada and advanced southward into the great, central, low-lying\r\nInterior Plains of the United States. (See figure 2.) These glaciers and\r\ntheir deposits modified the surface of the land they covered, mostly\r\nbetween the Missouri and the Ohio Rivers; they smoothed the contours and\r\ngave the land a more subdued aspect than it had before they came. This\r\nglacially smoothed and modified land is called the Central Lowland.\r\nAlthough the ice sheets lapped onto the northern part, the Great Plains\r\nis the largely unglaciated region that extends from the Gulf Coastal\r\nPlain in Texas northward into Canada between the Central Lowland and the\r\nfoot of the Rocky Mountains. Its eastern margin in Texas and Oklahoma is\r\nmarked by a prominent escarpment, the Caprock escarpment. Its southern\r\nmargin, where it abuts the Coastal Plain in Texas, is at another abrupt\r\nrise or scarp along the Balcones fault zone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 2.—Physical divisions of the United States and\r\nmaximum extent of the continental ice sheets during the Great Ice Age._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       THE GREAT PLAINS—ITS PARTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the Great Plains are many large areas that differ greatly from\r\nadjoining areas (fig. 3). The Black Hills stands out distinctively from\r\nthe surrounding lower land, and its dark, forested prominence can be\r\nseen for scores of miles from any direction. At the southern end of the\r\nGreat Plains is another, less imposing, forested prominence—the Central\r\nTexas Uplift. Most impressive, perhaps, is the huge, nearly flat plateau\r\nknown as the High Plains, which extends southward from the northern\r\nborder of Nebraska through the Panhandle of Texas, and which forms the\r\ncentral part of the Great Plains. The east and west rims of the southern\r\nHigh Plains are at high, cliffed, erosional escarpments—the Caprock\r\nescarpment on the east and the Mescalero escarpment on the west. The\r\nnorth edge of the High Plains is defined by another escarpment, the Pine\r\nRidge escarpment, which separates the High Plains from a region that has\r\nbeen greatly dissected by the Missouri River and its tributaries. There,\r\nseveral levels of rolling upland are surmounted by small mountainous\r\nmasses and flat-topped buttes and are entrenched by streams. This region\r\nis the Missouri Plateau. The continental glacier lapped onto the\r\nnortheastern part of the Missouri Plateau and altered its surface.\r\n\r\nThe South Platte and Arkansas Rivers and their tributaries have\r\nsimilarly dissected an area along the mountain front that is called the\r\nColorado Piedmont, and the Pecos River has excavated a broad valley\r\ntrending southward from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in New Mexico\r\ninto Texas. The Mescalero escarpment separates the Pecos Valley from the\r\nsouthern High Plains (fig. 4). South and east of the Pecos Valley,\r\nextending to the Rio Grande and the Coastal Plain, is a broad plateau of\r\nbare, stripped, flat-lying limestone layers bearing little but cactus\r\nthat is called the Edwards Plateau. Green, crop-filled valleys with\r\ngently sloping valley walls and rounded stream divides trend eastward\r\nfrom the High Plains of western Kansas and characterize a Plains Border\r\nsection. And finally, between the Colorado Piedmont on the north and the\r\nPecos Valley on the south, volcanic vents, cinder cones, and lava fields\r\nform another distinctive terrain in the part of the Great Plains called\r\nthe Raton section.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 3.—The Great Plains province and its sections._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 4.—Mescalero escarpment and the southern High\r\nPlains (Llano Estacado) south of Tucumcari, N. Mex., Photograph by C. D.\r\nMiller, U. S. Geological Survey._]\r\n\r\nCan such diverse parts of our land have a sufficiently common origin to\r\njustify their being considered part of one unified whole—the Great\r\nPlains? Probably so, but to understand why, we must examine some of the\r\nearlier geologic history of the Great Plains as well as subsequent\r\nevents revealed in the present landforms. We will find that all parts of\r\nthis region we call the Great Plains have a similar early history, and\r\nthat the differences we see are the results of local dominance of\r\ncertain processes in the ultimate shaping of the landscape, mostly\r\nduring the last few million years. The distinctive character of the\r\nlandscape in each section is determined in part by both the early events\r\nand the later shaping processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EARLY HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Interior Plains, of which the Great Plains is the western, mostly\r\nunglaciated part (fig. 2), is the least complicated part of our\r\ncontinent geologically except for the Coastal Plain. For most of the\r\nhalf billion years from 570 million (fig. 5) until about 70 million\r\nyears ago, shallow seas lay across the interior of our continent (fig. 6\r\n). A thick sequence of layered sediments, mostly between 5,000 and\r\n10,000 feet thick, but more in places, was deposited onto the subsiding\r\nfloor of the interior ocean (table 1). These sediments, now consolidated\r\ninto rock, rest on a floor of very old rocks that are much like the\r\nancient rocks of the Superior Upland.\r\n\r\nAbout 70 million years ago the seas were displaced from the continental\r\ninterior by slow uplift of the continent, and the landscape that\r\nappeared was simply the extensive, nearly flat floor of the former sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     WARPING AND STREAM DEPOSITION\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of these rocks of marine origin lie at considerable depth beneath\r\nthe land surface, concealed by an overlying thick, layered sequence of\r\nrocks laid down by streams, wind, and glaciers. Nevertheless, their\r\ngeologic character, position, and form are exceptionally well known from\r\ninformation gained from thousands of wells that have been drilled for\r\noil. The initial, nearly horizontal position of the layers of rock\r\nbeneath the Interior Plains has been little disturbed except where\r\nmountains like the Black Hills were uplifted about 70 million years ago.\r\nAt those places, which are all in the northern and southern parts of the\r\nGreat Plains, the sedimentary layers have been warped up and locally\r\nbroken by the rise of hot molten rock from depth. Elsewhere in the\r\nInterior Plains, however, earth forces of about the same period caused\r\nonly a reemphasis of gentle undulations in the Earth’s crust.\r\n\r\nThese undulations affected both the older basement rocks and the\r\noverlying sedimentary rocks, and they take the form of gentle basins and\r\narches that in some places span several States. (See sketch map, figure\r\n7.) A series of narrow basins lies along the mountain front on the west\r\nside of the Great Plains. A broad, discontinuous arch extends southwest\r\nfrom the Superior Upland to the Rocky Mountain front to form a buried\r\ndivide that separates the large Williston basin on the north from the\r\nAnadarko basin to the south.\r\n\r\nWhile the flat-lying layers of the Interior Plains were being only\r\ngently warped, vastly different earth movements were taking place\r\nfarther west, in the area of the present Rocky Mountains. Along a\r\nrelatively narrow north-trending belt, extending from Mexico to Alaska,\r\nthe land was being uplifted at a great rate. The layers of sedimentary\r\nrock deposited in the inland sea were stripped from the crest of the\r\nrising mountainous belt by erosion and transported to its flanks as the\r\ngravel, sand, and mud of streams and rivers. This transported sediment\r\nwas deposited on the plains to form the rocks of the Cretaceous Hell\r\nCreek, Lance, Laramie, Vermejo, and Raton Formations. Vegetation thrived\r\non this alluvial plain, and thick accumulations of woody debris were\r\nburied to ultimately become coal. This lush vegetation provided ample\r\nfood for the hordes of three-horned dinosaurs (_Triceratops_) that\r\nroamed these plains. Their fossilized remains are found from Canada to\r\nNew Mexico.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 5.—Geologic time chart and the progression of\r\nlife forms. Note Cretaceous_ Triceratops, _Oligocene_ Titanotheres, _and\r\nMiocene_ Moropus.]\r\n\r\n                                 GEOLOGIC TIME\r\n                            The Age of the Earth\r\n\r\n  The Earth is very old—4.5 billion years or more according to recent\r\n  estimates. Most of the evidence for an ancient Earth is contained in\r\n  the rocks that form the Earth’s crust. The rock layers themselves—like\r\n  pages in a long and complicated history—record the surface-shaping\r\n  events of the past, and buried within them are traces of life—the\r\n  plants and animals that evolved from organic structures that existed\r\n  perhaps 3 billion years ago.\r\n\r\n  Also contained in rocks once molten are radioactive elements whose\r\n  isotopes provide Earth scientists with an atomic clock. Within these\r\n  rocks, “parent” isotopes decay at a predictable rate to form\r\n  “daughter” isotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent and\r\n  daughter isotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated.\r\n\r\n  Thus, the results of studies of rock layers (stratigraphy), and of\r\n  fossils (paleontology), coupled with the ages of certain rocks as\r\n  measured by atomic clocks (geochronology), attest to a very old Earth!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 6.—Generalized paleogeographic map of the United\r\nStates in Late Cretaceous time (65 to 80 million years ago), when most\r\nof the Great Plains was beneath the sea._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 7.—Structural setting of the Great Plains.\r\nWilliston basin and Anadarko basin are separated by a midcontinental\r\narch._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table 1.—Generalized chart of rocks of the Great Plains]\r\n\r\n   Geologic age        Missouri        High Plains—Plains         Pecos\r\n    Millions of       Plateau—Black      Border—Colorado      Valley—Edwards\r\n     years ago            Hills              Piedmont         Plateau—Central\r\n                                                                   Texas\r\n\r\n  Quaternary\r\n     Pleistocene  Glacial deposits,   Alluvium, sand       Piedmont, terrace,\r\n                    alluvium, and       dunes, and loess     and bolson\r\n                    terrace deposits                         deposits\r\n                2 erosional surface\r\n  Tertiary\r\n     Pliocene     EROSION\r\n                5 Flaxville Gravel    Ogallala formation\r\n                    and Ogallala\r\n                    Formation\r\n     Miocene      Arikaree Formation  Arikaree Formation\r\n            22-24 erosional surface\r\n     Oligocene    White River Group   White River Group    Mostly missing\r\n                                                             because of\r\n                                                             erosion or\r\n                                                             nondeposition\r\n            37-38 erosional surface\r\n     Eocene       Wasatch and Golden\r\n                    Valley Formations\r\n            53-54                     Dawson Arkose\r\n     Paleocene    Fort Union          Denver, Poison\r\n                    Formation           Canyon, and Raton\r\n                                        Formations\r\n               65\r\n  Cretaceous      Hell Creek and      Vermejo and Laramie\r\n                    Lance Formations    Formations\r\n                  Fox Hills Sandstone Trinidad and Fox\r\n                                        Hills Sandstones\r\n                  Shales, sandstones, and limestones\r\n                    deposited in Late Cretaceous sea\r\n                  Dakota Sandstone    Dakota Sandstone\r\n                    and Lakota\r\n                    Formation\r\n                                      Glen Rose and\r\n                                        Edwards Limestones\r\n              136\r\n  Jurassic        Sundance            Morrison Formation   Jurassic rocks not\r\n                    Formation, Ellis                         present\r\n                    Group, and\r\n                    Unkpapa Sandstone\r\n          190-195\r\n  Triassic        Dominantly red rocks\r\n              225\r\n  PALEOZOIC       Paleozoic rocks, undivided\r\n              570\r\n  PRECAMBRIAN     Precambrian rocks, undivided\r\n\r\nAs the mountains continued to rise, the eroding streams cut into the old\r\ncore rocks of the mountains, and that debris too was carried to the\r\nflanks and onto the adjoining plains. The mountainous belt continued to\r\nrise intermittently, and volcanoes began to appear about 50 million\r\nyears ago. Together, the mountains and volcanoes provided huge\r\nquantities of sediment, which the streams transported to the plains and\r\ndeposited. The areas nearest the mountains were covered by sediments of\r\nLate Cretaceous and Paleocene age (table 1)—the Poison Canyon Formation\r\nto the south, the Dawson and Denver Formations in the Denver area, and\r\nthe Fort Union Formation to the north (fig. 8). Vegetation continued to\r\nflourish, especially in the northern part of the Great Plains, and was\r\nburied to form the thick lignite and subbituminous coal beds of the Fort\r\nUnion Formation (fig. 9). The earliest mammals, most of whose remains\r\ncome from the Paleocene Fort Union Formation, have few modern survivors.\r\n\r\nBeginning about 45 million years ago, in Eocene time, there was a long\r\nperiod of stability lasting perhaps 10 million years, when there was\r\nlittle uplift of the mountains and, therefore, little deposition on the\r\nplains. A widespread and strongly developed soil formed over much of the\r\nGreat Plains during this period of stability. With renewed uplift and\r\nvolcanism in the mountains at the end of this period, great quantities\r\nof sediment again were carried to the plains by streams and spread over\r\nthe northern Great Plains and southeastward to the arch or divide\r\nseparating the Williston and Anadarko basins (fig. 8). Those sediments\r\nform the White River Group, in which the South Dakota Badlands are\r\ncarved. In addition to the _Titanotheres_, huge beasts with large, long\r\nhorns on their snouts who lived only during the Oligocene (37 to 22\r\nmillion years ago), vast herds of camels, rhinoceroses, horses, and\r\ntapirs—animals now found native only on other continents—grazed those\r\nOligocene semiarid grassland plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 8.—Progressive southeastward expansion of areas\r\ncovered by Paleocene, Oligocene, and Miocene-Pliocene sedimentary\r\ndeposits._]\r\n\r\n  Powder River basin\r\n  Denver basin\r\n  Raton basin\r\n  PLAINS\r\n    Margin of Oligocene deposition\r\n    Margin of Miocene-Pliocene deposition\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 9.—Big Horn coal strip mine in Fort Union\r\nFormation at Acme, Wyo. Photograph by F. W. Osterwald, U.S. Geological\r\nSurvey._]\r\n\r\nSometime between 20 and 30 million years ago the streams began\r\ndepositing sand and gravel beyond the divide, and, for another 10\r\nmillion years or more, stream sediments of the Arikaree and Ogallala\r\nFormations spread over the entire Great Plains from Canada to Texas,\r\nexcept where mountainous areas such as the Black Hills stood above the\r\nplains. Between 5 and 10 million years ago, then, the entire Great\r\nPlains was an eastward-sloping depositional plain surmounted only by a\r\nfew mountain masses. Horses, camels, rhinoceroses, and a strange\r\nhorselike creature with clawed feet (called _Moropus_) lived on this\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SCULPTURING THE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nSometime between 5 and 10 million years ago, however, a great change\r\ntook place, apparently as a result of regional uplift of the entire\r\nwestern part of the continent. While before, the streams had been\r\ndepositing sediment on the plains for more than 60 million years,\r\nbuilding up a huge thickness of sedimentary rock layers, now the streams\r\nwere forced to cut down into and excavate the sediments they had\r\nformerly deposited. As uplift continued—and it may still be\r\ncontinuing—the streams cut deeper and deeper into the layered stack and\r\ndeveloped tributary systems that excavated broad areas. High divides\r\nwere left between streams in some places, and broad plateaus were formed\r\nand remain in other places. The great central area was essentially\r\nuntouched by erosion and remained standing above the dissected areas\r\nsurrounding it as the escarpment-rimmed plateau that is the High Plains.\r\n\r\nThis downcutting and excavation by streams, then, which began between 5\r\nand 10 million years ago, roughed out the landscape of the Great Plains\r\nand created the sections we call the Missouri Plateau, the Colorado\r\nPiedmont, the Pecos Valley, the Edwards Plateau, and the Plains Border\r\nSection. Nearly all the individual landforms that now attract the eye\r\nhave been created by geologic processes during the last 2 million years.\r\nIt truly is a young landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      LANDFORMS OF TODAY—The surface features of the Great Plains\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountainous sections of the Great Plains were formed long before the\r\nremaining areas were outlined by erosion. Uplift of the Black Hills and\r\nthe Central Texas Uplift began as the continental interior was raised\r\nand the last Cretaceous sea was displaced, 65 to 70 million years ago.\r\nThey stood well above the surrounding plains long before any sediments\r\nfrom the distant Rocky Mountains began to accumulate at their bases. In\r\nsouthern Colorado and northern New Mexico, molten rock invaded the\r\nsedimentary layers between 22 and 26 million years ago. The Spanish\r\nPeaks were formed at this time from hot magma that domed up the surface\r\nlayers but did not break through; the magma has since cooled and\r\nsolidified and has been exposed by erosion. Elsewhere the magma reached\r\nthe surface, forming volcanoes, fissures, and basalt flows. A great\r\nthickness of basalt flows accumulated at Raton Mesa and Mesa de Maya\r\nbetween 8 and 2 million years ago. Volcanism has continued\r\nintermittently, and the huge cinder cone of Capulin Mountain was created\r\nby explosive eruption only 10,000 to 4,000 years ago. Most of these\r\nvolcanic masses were formed before major downcutting by the streams\r\nbegan. Other igneous intrusions and volcanic areas in the northern Great\r\nPlains similarly were formed before the streams were incised.\r\n\r\nTo examine the origin of the present landscape and of the landforms\r\ntypical of the various sections of the Great Plains, it is convenient to\r\nbegin with the Black Hills, the Central Texas Uplift, and the Raton\r\nsection simply because they were formed first—they existed before the\r\nother sections were outlined.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BLACK HILLS\r\n\r\nThe Black Hills is a huge, elliptically domed area in northwestern South\r\nDakota and northeastern Wyoming, about 125 miles long and 65 miles wide\r\n(fig. 10). Rapid City, S. Dak., is on the Missouri Plateau at the east\r\nedge of the Black Hills. Uplift caused erosion to remove the overlying\r\ncover of marine sedimentary rocks and expose the granite and metamorphic\r\nrocks that form the core of the dome. The peaks of the central part of\r\nthe Black Hills presently are 3,000 to 4,000 feet above the surrounding\r\nplains. Harney Peak, with an altitude of 7,242 feet, is the highest\r\npoint in South Dakota. These central spires and peaks all are carved\r\nfrom granite and other igneous and metamorphic rocks that form the core\r\nof the uplift. The heads of four of our great Presidents are sculpted\r\nfrom this granite at Mount Rushmore National Memorial. Joints in the\r\nrocks have controlled weathering processes that influenced the final\r\nshaping of many of these landforms. Closely spaced joints have produced\r\nthe spires of the Needles area, and widely spaced joints have produced\r\nthe rounded forms of granite that are seen near Sylvan Lake (fig. 11).\r\n\r\nMarine sedimentary rocks surrounding the old core rocks form\r\nwell-defined belts. Lying against the old core rocks and completely\r\nsurrounding them are Paleozoic limestones that form the Limestone\r\nPlateau (fig. 10). These tilted layers have steep erosional scarps\r\nfacing the central part of the Black Hills. Wind Cave and Jewel Cave\r\nwere produced by ground water dissolving these limestones along joints.\r\nThese caves are sufficiently impressive to be designated as a national\r\npark and a national monument, respectively. Encircling the Limestone\r\nPlateau is a continuous valley cut in soft Triassic shale. This valley\r\nhas been called “the Racetrack,” because of its continuity, and the Red\r\nValley, because of its color. Surrounding the Red Valley is an outer\r\nhogback ridge formed by the tilted layers of the Dakota Sandstone, which\r\nare quite hard and resistant to erosion. Streams that flow from the\r\ncentral part of the Black Hills pass through the Dakota hogback in\r\nnarrow gaps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 10.—Diagram of the Black Hills uplift by A.

Dak._]\r\n\r\nThe Black Hills, then, is an uplifted area that has been carved deeply\r\nbut differentially by streams to produce its major outlines. Those\r\noutlines have been modified mainly by weathering of the ancient core\r\nrocks and solution of the limestone of the Limestone Plateau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CENTRAL TEXAS UPLIFT\r\n\r\nThe domed rocks of the Central Texas Uplift form a topography different\r\nfrom that of the Black Hills. Erosion of a broad, uplifted dome here has\r\nexposed a core of old granites, gneisses, and schists, as in the Black\r\nHills, but in the Central Texas Uplift, erosion has produced a\r\ntopographic basin, rather than high peaks and spires, on the old rocks\r\nof the central area. A low plateau surface dissected into rounded ridges\r\nand narrow valleys slopes gently eastward from the edge of the central\r\narea to an escarpment at the Balcones fault zone, which determines the\r\neastern edge of the Great Plains here. Northwest of the central basin\r\nthe Colorado River flows in a broad lowland about 100 miles long, but\r\nthe northern edge of the uplift, forming a divide between the Brazos and\r\nthe Colorado Rivers, is a series of mesas formed of more resistant\r\nsandstone and limestone.\r\n\r\nThe cutting action of streams, modified or controlled in part by\r\ndifferences in hardness of the rock layers, has been responsible for the\r\nlandforms of the Central Texas Uplift. Weathering of the old core rocks\r\nhas softened them sufficiently to permit deeper erosion of the central\r\narea, and solution of limestone by ground water has formed such features\r\nas Longhorn Caverns, 11 miles southwest of Burnet, Tex.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             RATON SECTION\r\n\r\nVolcanism characterizes the Raton section. The volcanic rocks, which\r\nform peaks, mesas, and cones, have armored the older sedimentary rocks\r\nand protected them from the erosion that has cut deeply into the\r\nadjoining Colorado Piedmont to the north and Pecos Valley to the south.\r\nThe south edge of the Raton section is marked by a spectacular\r\nsouth-facing escarpment cut on the nearly flat-lying Dakota Sandstone.\r\nThis escarpment is the Canadian escarpment, north of the Canadian River.\r\nNorthward for about 100 miles, the landscape is that of a nearly flat\r\nplateau cut on Cretaceous rock surmounted here and there by young\r\nvolcanic vents, cones, and lava fields. Capulin Mountain is a cinder\r\ncone only 10,000 to 4,000 years old (fig. 12). Near the New\r\nMexico-Colorado border, huge piles of lava were erupted 8 to 2 million\r\nyears ago onto an older, higher surface on top of either the Ogallala\r\nFormation of Miocene age or the Poison Canyon Formation of Paleocene\r\nage. (See table 1.) These lava flows formed a resistant cap, which\r\nprotected the underlying rock from erosion while all the surrounding\r\nrock washed away. The result is the high, flat-topped mesas, such as\r\nRaton Mesa and Mesa de Maya (fig. 13), that now form the divide between\r\nthe Arkansas and Canadian Rivers. At Fishers Peak, on the west end of\r\nRaton Mesa, about 800 feet of basalt flows rest on the Poison Canyon\r\nFormation at about 8,800 feet in altitude. Farther east, on Mesa de\r\nMaya, about 400 feet of basalt flows overlie the Ogallala Formation at\r\naltitudes ranging from about 6,500 feet at the west end to about 5,200\r\nfeet at the east end, some 35 miles to the east. The Ogallala here rests\r\non Cretaceous Dakota Sandstone and Purgatoire Formation, for the Poison\r\nCanyon Formation was removed by erosion along the crest of a local\r\nuplift before the Ogallala was deposited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 12.—Capulin Mountain National Monument in\r\nnortheastern New Mexico. This huge cinder cone, which erupted between\r\n4,000 and 10,000 years ago, rises more than 1,000 feet above its base.\r\nPhotograph by R. D. Miller, U.S. Geological Survey._]\r\n\r\nEast of the belt of upturned sedimentary layers that form the hogback\r\nridges at the front of the Rocky Mountains, the layered rocks in the\r\nRaton Basin have been intruded in many places by igneous bodies, the two\r\nlargest of which form the Spanish Peaks (fig. 14), southwest of\r\nWalsenburg, Colo. These two peaks are formed by igneous bodies that were\r\nintruded 26 to 22 million years ago and have since been exposed by\r\nremoval of the overlying sedimentary rock layers by erosion. Radiating\r\nfrom the Spanish Peaks are hundreds of dikes, nearly vertical slabs of\r\nigneous rock that filled fractures radiating from the centers of\r\nintrusion. Erosion of the sedimentary layers has left many of these\r\ndikes as conspicuous vertical walls of igneous rock that project high\r\nabove the surrounding land surface. Some of these dikes north of\r\nTrinidad, Colo. extend eastward for about 25 miles, almost to the\r\nPurgatoire River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 13.—Lava-capped Mesa de Maya, east of Trinidad,\r\nColo. Spanish Peaks in left distance. Mesa rises about 1,000 feet above\r\nsurrounding area. Photograph by R. B. Taylor, U.S. Geological Survey._]\r\n\r\nThe northern boundary of the Raton section is placed somewhat\r\nindefinitely at the northern limit of the area injected by igneous\r\ndikes. The eastern boundary of the Raton section is at the eastern\r\nmargin of the lavas of Mesa de Maya and adjoining mesas, where\r\nlava-capped outliers of Ogallala Formation are separated from the\r\nOgallala of the High Plains only by the canyon of Carrizo Creek.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              HIGH PLAINS\r\n\r\nAt the end of Ogallala deposition, some 5 million years ago, the Great\r\nPlains, with the exception of the uplifted and the volcanic areas, was a\r\nvast, gently sloping plain that extended from the mountain front\r\neastward to beyond the present Missouri River in some places. Regional\r\nuplift of the western part of the continent forced the streams to cut\r\ndownward; land near the mountains was stripped away by the Missouri, the\r\nPlatte, the Arkansas, and the Pecos Rivers, and the eastern border of\r\nthe plains was gnawed away by lesser streams. A large central area of\r\nthe plain is preserved, however, essentially untouched and unaffected by\r\nthe streams, as a little-modified remnant of the depositional surface of\r\n5 million years ago. This Ogallala-capped preserved remnant of that\r\nupraised surface is the High Plains. In only one place does that old\r\nsurface still extend to the mountains—at the so-called “Gangplank” west\r\nof Cheyenne, Wyo. (fig. 15). In places, as at Scotts Bluff National\r\nMonument, Nebr. (fig. 16), small fragments of this surface have been\r\nisolated from the High Plains by erosion and now stand above the\r\nsurrounding area as buttes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 14.—Spanish Peaks, southwest of Walsenburg, Colo.\r\nIgneous rocks and many radiating dikes exposed by erosion.

Buttes on the south side of the valley of the North\r\nPlatte River isolated by erosion from High Plains in the background.\r\nHighest butte stands about 800 feet above valley floor._]\r\n\r\nThe High Plains extends southward from the Pine Ridge escarpment, near\r\nthe South Dakota-Nebraska border (fig. 3), to the Edwards Plateau in\r\nTexas. The Platte, the Arkansas, and the Canadian Rivers have cut\r\nthrough the High Plains. That part of the High Plains south of the\r\nCanadian River is called the Southern High Plains, or the Llano Estacado\r\n(staked plain). The origin of this name is uncertain, but it has been\r\nsuggested that the term Llano Estacado was applied by early travelers\r\nbecause this part of the High Plains is so nearly flat and devoid of\r\nlandmarks that it was necessary for those pioneers to set lines of\r\nstakes to permit them to retrace their routes.\r\n\r\nThe Llano Estacado is bounded on the west by the Mescalero escarpment\r\n(fig. 4) and on the east by the Caprock escarpment. The southern margin\r\nwith the Edwards Plateau is less well defined, but King Mountain, north\r\nof McCamey, Tex., is a scarp-bounded southern promontory of the High\r\nPlains. The remarkably flat surface of the Llano Estacado is abundantly\r\npitted by sinks and depressions in the surface of the Ogallala\r\nFormation; these were formed by solution of the limestone by rainwater\r\nand blowing away or deflation by wind of the remaining insoluble\r\nparticles. Many of these solution-deflation depressions are aligned like\r\nstrings of beads, suggesting that their location is controlled by some\r\nkind of underlying structure, such as intersections of joints in the\r\nOgallala Formation.\r\n\r\nThe solution-deflation depressions are less abundant north of the\r\nCanadian River, but occur on the High Plains surface northward to the\r\nArkansas River and along the eastern part of the High Plains north of\r\nthe Arkansas to the South Fork of the Republican River.\r\n\r\nCovering much of the northern High Plains, however, are sand dunes and\r\nwindblown silt deposits (loess) that mantle the Ogallala Formation and\r\nconceal any solution-deflation depressions that might have formed. The\r\nNebraska Sand Hills (fig. 17), the largest area of sand dunes in the\r\nwestern hemisphere, is a huge area of stabilized sand dunes that extends\r\nfrom the White River in South Dakota southward beyond the Platte River\r\nalmost to the Republican River in western Nebraska but only to the Loup\r\nRiver in the northeast part of the High Plains (fig. 18). Loess covers\r\nthe western High Plains southward from the sand dunes almost to the\r\nArkansas River, and to the South Fork of the Republican in the eastern\r\npart. This extensive cover of loess has created a fertile land that\r\nmakes it an important part of America’s wheatlands (fig. 19).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 17.—Aerial view, looking northwest, of the\r\nNebraska Sand Hills west of Ashby, Nebr._]\r\n\r\nOther, smaller areas of sand dunes lie south of the Arkansas River\r\nvalley. The only large areas of sand dunes on the Llano Estacado, or\r\nSouthern High Plains, are along the southwestern margin near Monahans,\r\nsouthwest of Odessa, Tex.\r\n\r\nOil and gas are present in the Paleozoic rocks that underlie the High\r\nPlains at depth. Gas fields are ubiquitous in much of the eastern part\r\nof the High Plains between the Arkansas and Canadian Rivers. Just south\r\nof the Canadian River, at the northeast corner of the Southern High\r\nPlains, a huge oil and gas field has been developed near Pampa, Tex. Oil\r\nand gas fields also are abundant in the southwestern part of the\r\nSouthern High Plains, south of Littlefield, Tex.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 18.—The Sand Hills region of Nebraska.

Photograph by Judy Miller._]\r\n\r\nThe surface of the High Plains, then, has been little modified by\r\nstreams since the end of Ogallala deposition. It has been raised by\r\nregional uplift and pitted by solution and deflation, and large parts of\r\nit have been covered by wind-blown sand and silt. It has been drilled\r\nfor oil and gas and extensively farmed, but it is still a geological\r\nrarity—a preserved land surface that is 5 million years old.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            MISSOURI PLATEAU\r\n\r\nBeginning about 5 million years ago, regional uplift of the western part\r\nof the continent forced streams, which for 30 million years had been\r\ndepositing sediment nearly continuously on the Great Plains, to change\r\ntheir behavior and begin to cut into the layers of sediment they so long\r\nhad been depositing. The predecessor of the Missouri River ate headward\r\ninto the northern Great Plains and developed a tributary system that\r\nexcavated deeply into the accumulated deposits near the mountain front\r\nand carried away huge volumes of sediment from the Great Plains to\r\nHudson Bay. By 2 million years ago, the streams had cut downward to\r\nwithin a few hundred feet of their present level. This region that has\r\nbeen so thoroughly dissected by the Missouri River and its tributaries\r\nis called the Missouri Plateau.\r\n\r\nAbout 2 million years ago, after much downcutting had already taken\r\nplace and river channels had been firmly established, great ice sheets\r\nadvanced southward from Canada into the United States. (See figure 2.)\r\nThese continental glaciers formed, advanced, and retreated several times\r\nduring the last 2 million years. At the north and east margins of the\r\nMissouri Plateau they lapped onto a high area, leaving a mantle of\r\nglacial deposits covering the bedrock surface and forcing streams to\r\nadopt new courses along the margin of ice. The part of the Missouri\r\nPlateau covered by the continental glaciers now is referred to as the\r\nGlaciated Missouri Plateau. South of the part once covered by ice is the\r\nUnglaciated Missouri Plateau.\r\n\r\n    Preglacial Drainage\r\n\r\nBefore the initial advance of the continental ice sheets, the Missouri\r\nRiver flowed northeastward into Canada and to Hudson Bay. Its major\r\ntributaries, the Yellowstone and the Little Missouri joined the Missouri\r\nin northwestern North Dakota. The east-flowing Knife, Heart, and\r\nCannonball Rivers in North Dakota also joined a stream that flowed\r\nnorthward to Hudson Bay.\r\n\r\n    Glaciated Missouri Plateau\r\n\r\nWhen the continental ice sheets spread southward into northern Montana\r\nand the Dakotas, a few isolated areas in Montana stood above the\r\nsurrounding plain. These are mostly areas that were uplifted by the\r\nintrusion of igneous bodies long before the streams began downcutting\r\nand carving the land. The northernmost of these isolated mountains, the\r\nSweetgrass Hills, were surrounded by ice and became nunataks, or islands\r\nof land, in the sea of advancing ice, which pushed southward up against\r\nthe Highwood Mountains, near Great Falls, the Bearpaws south of Havre,\r\nand the Little Rockies to the east.\r\n\r\nMuch of the northern part of Montana is a plain of little relief that is\r\nthe surface of a nearly continuous cover of glacial deposits, generally\r\nless than 50 feet thick. This plain has been incised by the east-flowing\r\npostglacial Teton, Marias, and Milk Rivers.\r\n\r\nIn North Dakota, a high area on the east side of the Williston basin\r\nacted as a barrier to the advance of the ice, most of which was diverted\r\nsoutheastward. The margin of the ice sheet, however, lapped onto the\r\nbedrock high, where it stagnated. Earlier advances moved farthest south;\r\nthe later advances stopped north of the present course of the Missouri\r\nRiver—their maximum position marked by ridges of unsorted, glacially\r\ntransported rock debris (till) called terminal moraines. North of the\r\nterminal moraines is a distinctive landscape characterized by a rolling,\r\nhummocky, or hilly surface with thousands of closed depressions between\r\nthe hills and hummocks, most of them occupied by lakes. This is the\r\ndeposit left by the stagnant or dead ice, and it is called dead-ice\r\nmoraine. The rolling upland in North Dakota that is covered by dead-ice\r\nmoraine and ridges of terminal moraines from the last glacial advances\r\nis called the Coteau du Missouri (fig. 20). A gently sloping scarp,\r\nseveral hundred feet high and mostly covered by glacial deposits\r\n(referred to collectively as drift), separates the Coteau du Missouri\r\nfrom the lower, nearly flat, drift-covered plains of the Central Lowland\r\nto the east. This escarpment, which is called the Missouri escarpment,\r\nis virtually continuous across the State of North Dakota southward into\r\nSouth Dakota. The base of the Missouri escarpment is the eastern\r\nboundary of the Great Plains in these northern states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 20.—Ground moraine on the Coteau du Missouri,\r\nnorthwestern North Dakota. Photograph by R. M. Lindvall, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey._]\r\n\r\nThe advancing ice front blocked one after another of the\r\nnorthward-flowing streams of the region, diverting them eastward along\r\nthe ice front. Shonkin Sag, north of the Highwood Mountains near Great\r\nFalls, Mont., is an abandoned diversion channel of the Missouri River,\r\noccupied when the ice front stood close to the north slopes of the\r\nHighwoods. Much of the present course of the Missouri River from Great\r\nFalls, Mont., to Kansas City, Mo., was established as an ice-marginal\r\nchannel, and the east-flowing part of the Little Missouri River in North\r\nDakota was formed in the same way. These valleys were cut during the\r\nlast 2 million years.\r\n\r\nThe north-flowing part of the Little Missouri River and the east-flowing\r\ncourses of the Knife, Heart, and Cannonball Rivers in North Dakota are\r\nfor the most part older, preglacial courses. The Little Missouri was\r\ndammed by the ice, and its waters impounded to form a huge lake during\r\nthe maximum stand of the ice, but the deposits of this glacial lake are\r\nfew and make no imprint on the landscape.\r\n\r\nThe valley of the east-flowing, glacially diverted part of the Little\r\nMissouri River, however, is markedly different from that of the\r\nnorth-flowing preglacial river. It is much narrower and has steeper\r\nwalls than the old valley. Because it is younger, it is little modified,\r\nexcept by huge landslides that have affected both walls of the valley.\r\nTremendous rotated landslide blocks in the North Unit of Theodore\r\nRoosevelt National Memorial Park are some of the best examples of the\r\nslump type of landslide to be seen anywhere (fig. 21).\r\n\r\nMelting ice at the front of the glaciers provided large volumes of\r\nmeltwater that flowed across the till-mantled surface in front of the\r\nglacier as it melted back toward Canada. This meltwater took many\r\ncourses to join the glacially diverted Missouri River, and these sinuous\r\nmeltwater channels wind across the dead-ice moraine and the older, less\r\nhummocky ground moraine between the Coteau du Missouri and the Missouri\r\nRiver. Locally the sediment carried by the meltwater streams was banked\r\nagainst a wall of ice to form a small hill of stratified drift that is\r\ncalled a kame. Streams flowing in tunnels beneath the ice formed\r\nsinuous, ridgelike deposits called eskers, and in places the meltwater\r\ndeposits form broad flat areas called outwash plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 21.—Rotated slump blocks in huge landslide, North\r\nUnit of Theodore Roosevelt National Memorial Park, N. Dak. Note that\r\nlayering of Fort Union Formation in cliffs on skyline, where landslide\r\noriginated, is horizontal._]\r\n\r\nThis rather limited variety of landforms, then, characterizes the\r\nlandscape of the Glaciated Missouri Plateau. The landforms themselves\r\nare testimony to their glacial origin and to the great advances of the\r\ncontinental ice sheets. This is a stream-carved terrain that has been\r\nmodified by continental glaciers and almost completely covered by a\r\nthick blanket of glacially transported and deposited rock debris,\r\nlocally hundreds of feet thick. Subsequent stream action has not altered\r\nthe landscape greatly.\r\n\r\n    Unglaciated Missouri Plateau\r\n\r\nBeyond the limits reached by the ice of the continental glaciers, the\r\nUnglaciated Missouri Plateau displays the greatest variety of landforms\r\nof any section of the Great Plains. In western Montana, many small\r\nmountain masses rise above the general level of the plateau, including\r\nthe Highwood, Bearpaw, and Little Rocky Mountains near the margin of the\r\nglaciated area, and the Judith, Big Snowy, Big Belt, Little Belt,\r\nCastle, and Crazy Mountains farther south (fig. 22). Many of these, such\r\nas the Crazy, Castle, Judith, and Big Snowy Mountains, are areas\r\nuplifted by large, deeply rooted, intrusive igneous bodies called\r\nstocks, which have been exposed by subsequent erosion of the arched\r\noverlying sedimentary rock layers. Some, such as the Highwood and\r\nBearpaw Mountains, are predominantly piles of lava flows, although in\r\nthe Bearpaws the related intrusive bodies of igneous rock form a part of\r\nthe mountains. The Big and Little Belt Mountains were formed by\r\nmushroom-shaped intrusive igneous bodies called laccoliths, which have\r\nspread out and domed between layers of sedimentary rocks. A number of\r\nigneous bodies also intrude the rocks of the Missouri Plateau around the\r\nperiphery of the Black Hills. Devils Tower, the first feature to be\r\ndesignated a National Monument, is the best known of these igneous rock\r\nfeatures (fig. 23).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 22.—The Highwood Mountains seen from the Little\r\nBelt Mountains, Mont. Photograph by I. J. Witkind, U. S. Geological\r\nSurvey._]\r\n\r\nThe uplift and volcanism that formed these mountains took place before\r\nthe streams began to cut downward and segment the Great Plains. The\r\nmountains had been greatly dissected before the advent of the Great Ice\r\nAge, when alpine glaciers formed on the Castle and the Crazy Mountains\r\nand flowed down some of the stream-cut valleys. Alpine glacial features\r\nsuch as cirques, in the high parts of the mountains, and glacially\r\nmodified U-shaped valleys (fig. 24) are impressive evidence of this\r\nglaciation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 23.—Devils Tower National Monument, Wyo. An\r\nigneous intrusive body exposed by erosion. Photograph by F. W.\r\nOsterwald, U. S. Geological Survey._]\r\n\r\nThe Missouri River and its tributaries—the Sun, Smith, Judith,\r\nMusselshell, and Yellowstone Rivers in Montana and the Little Missouri\r\nRiver in North Dakota—have cut down into the Missouri Plateau, cut broad\r\nupland surfaces at many levels, and established confined valleys with\r\nvalley floors flanked by terrace remnants of older floodplains. Locally,\r\nhigh buttes that are remnants of former interstream divides rise above\r\nthe uplands. Large lakes also were formed in most of these tributary\r\nvalleys because of damming by the continental ice sheets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 24.—U-shaped, glaciated valley of Big Timber\r\nCreek, Crazy Mountains, Mont. Photograph by W. C. Alden, 1921, U. S.\r\nGeological Survey._]\r\n\r\nWest of the Black Hills, in Wyoming, the Tongue River and the Powder\r\nRiver have excavated the Powder River Basin and produced similar\r\nfeatures (fig. 25). The east-flowing tributaries of the Missouri\r\nRiver—the Knife, Heart, and Cannonball Rivers in North Dakota and the\r\nGrand, Moreau, Belle Fourche, Cheyenne, Bad, and White Rivers in South\r\nDakota—similarly have shaped the landscape.\r\n\r\nMost of these rivers flow in broad, old valleys, established more than 2\r\nmillion years ago, before the first advance of the continental ice\r\nsheets. Some of these valleys have been widened by recession of the\r\nvalley walls by badland development. Badlands are formed by the cutting\r\naction of rivulets and rills flowing down over a steeply sloping face of\r\nsoft, fine-grained material composed mainly of clay and silt. The\r\nintricate carving by thousands of small streams of water produces the\r\ndistinctive rounded and gullied terrain we call badlands. Badlands\r\nNational Monument in South Dakota (fig. 26) has been established in the\r\nremarkable badlands terrain cut into the White River Group along the\r\nnorth valley wall of the White River, and the South Unit of Theodore\r\nRoosevelt National Memorial Park is in the colorful badlands of the\r\nLittle Missouri River, formed on the Fort Union Formation (fig. 27).\r\n\r\nThe White River also has cut a steep scarp along its southern wall that\r\nis called the Pine Ridge escarpment. This escarpment defines the\r\nboundary between the Missouri Plateau and the High Plains here.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 25.—View northeast across the Deckers coal mine\r\nand the Tongue River in the Powder River Basin, southeastern Montana.\r\nTypical terrain of unglaciated Missouri Plateau.

Geological Survey._]\r\n\r\nThe landscape of the Unglaciated Missouri Plateau has been determined\r\nlargely by the action of streams, but in some areas igneous intrusions\r\nand volcanoes have produced small mountain masses that interrupt the\r\nplain, and valley glaciers have modified the valleys in some of these\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 26.—Badlands in Badlands National Monument, S.\r\nDak.

The South\r\nPlatte on the north and the Arkansas River on the south, after leaving\r\nthe mountains, have excavated deeply into the Tertiary (65- to\r\n2-million-year-old) sedimentary rock layers of the Great Plains in\r\nColorado and removed great volumes of sediment. At Denver, the South\r\nPlatte River has cut downward 1,500 to 2,000 feet to its present level.\r\nThree well-formed terrace levels flank the river’s floodplain, and\r\nremnants of a number of well-formed higher land surfaces are preserved\r\nbetween the river and the mountains. Along the western margin of the\r\nColorado Piedmont, the layers of older sedimentary rock have been\r\nsharply upturned by the rise of the mountains. The eroded edges of these\r\nupturned layers have been eroded differentially, so that the hard\r\nsandstone and limestone layers form conspicuous and continuous hogback\r\nridges (fig. 28). North of the South Platte River, near the Wyoming\r\nborder, a scarp that has been cut on the rocks of the High Plains marks\r\nthe northern boundary of the Colorado Piedmont. Pawnee Buttes (fig. 29)\r\nare two of many butte outliers of the High Plains rocks near that scarp,\r\nseparated from the High Plains by erosion as is Scotts Bluff, farther\r\nnorth in Nebraska. To the east, about 10 miles northwest of Limon,\r\nColo., Cedar Point forms a west-jutting prow of the High Plains.\r\n\r\nThe Arkansas River similarly has excavated much of the Tertiary piedmont\r\ndeposits and cut deeply into the older Cretaceous marine rocks between\r\nCanon City and the Kansas border. The upturned layers along the mountain\r\nfront, marked by hogback ridges and intervening valleys, continue nearly\r\nuninterrupted around the south end of the Front Range into the embayment\r\nin the mountains at Canon City. Skyline Drive, a scenic drive at Canon\r\nCity, follows the crest of the Dakota hogback for a short distance and\r\nprovides a fine panorama of the Canon City embayment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 28.—Hogback ridges along the Front Range west of\r\nDenver, Colo. South Platte River emerges from the mountains and cuts\r\nthrough hogbacks in middle distance. Photograph courtesy of Eugene\r\nShearer, Intrasearch, Inc._]\r\n\r\nExtending eastward from the mountain front at Palmer Lake, a high divide\r\nseparates the drainage of the South Platte River from that of the\r\nArkansas River. The crest of the divide north of Colorado Springs is\r\ngenerally between 7,400 and 7,600 feet in altitude, but Interstate\r\nHighway 25 crosses it at about 7,350 feet, nearly 1,500 feet higher than\r\nColorado Springs and more than 2,000 feet higher than Denver. From the\r\ncrest of the divide to north of Castle Rock, resistant Oligocene Castle\r\nRock Conglomerate (which is equivalent to part of the White River Group\r\nof the High Plains) is preserved in many places and forms a protective\r\ncaprock on mesas and buttes. This picturesque part of the Colorado\r\nPiedmont looks quite different from the excavated valleys of the South\r\nPlatte and Arkansas Rivers.\r\n\r\nMuch of the terrain in the two river valleys has been smoothed by a\r\nnearly continuous mantle of windblown sand and silt. Northwesterly\r\nwinds, which frequently blow with near-hurricane velocities, have\r\nwhipped fine material from the floodplains of the streams and spread it\r\neastward and southeastward over much of the Colorado Piedmont.\r\nWell-formed dunes are not common, but alined gentle ridges of sand and\r\nsilt and abundant shallow blowout depressions inform us of the windblown\r\norigin of this cover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 29.—Pawnee Buttes in northeastern Colorado.\r\nButtes isolated by erosion from High Plains in the background.

Miller, U. S. Geological Survey._]\r\n\r\nIn the Colorado Piedmont, then, the erosional effects of streams are the\r\nmost conspicuous features of the landscape, but these are enhanced by\r\nthe steep tilting of the layered rocks along the western margin as a\r\nresult of earth movement and modified by the nearly ubiquitous products\r\nof wind action, which have softened the landscape with a widespread\r\ncover of windblown sand and silt.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PECOS VALLEY\r\n\r\nSouth of the land of volcanic rocks that is the Raton section, the Pecos\r\nRiver has cut a broad valley from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, in New\r\nMexico, southward to the Rio Grande, and has removed the piedmont cover\r\nof Ogallala Formation and cut deeply into the underlying rocks. The\r\nOgallala Formation capping the High Plains to the east forms a rimrock\r\nat the top of the sharp Mescalero escarpment, which is the eastern\r\nboundary of the Pecos Valley. (See figure 4.) The western boundary of\r\nthe Pecos Valley is the eastern base of discontinuous mountain ranges.\r\n\r\nThe great thickness of Tertiary deposits that formed on the northern\r\nGreat Plains did not accumulate here, and the Pecos River has cut its\r\nvalley into the older marine sedimentary rocks. The rocks underlying the\r\nsurface of much of the Pecos Valley are upper Paleozoic limestones.\r\n\r\nThe soluble nature of limestone is responsible for some of the most\r\nspectacular features of the landscape in the Pecos Valley. For about 10\r\nmiles north and 50 miles south of Vaughn, N. Mex., collapsed solution\r\ncaverns in upper Paleozoic limestones have produced an unusual type of\r\ntopography called karst. Karst topography is typified by numerous\r\nclosely spaced sinks or closed depressions, some of which are very deep\r\nholes, caused by the collapse of the roof of a cave or solution cavity\r\ninto the underground void, leaving hills, spines, or hummocks at the top\r\nof the intervening walls or ribs separating the depressions.\r\n\r\nAlthough the karst in the vicinity of Vaughn is perhaps the most\r\nconspicuous solution phenomenon, sinks and caves are common throughout\r\nthe Pecos Valley. At Bottomless Lakes State Park east of Roswell, N.\r\nMex., seven lakes occupy large sinkholes caused by the solution of salt\r\nand gypsum in underlying rocks.\r\n\r\nThe most spectacular example of solution of limestone by ground water is\r\nCarlsbad Caverns, N. Mex., one of the most beautiful caves in the world.\r\nThis celebrated solution cavity is preserved in a national park.\r\n\r\nThe Pecos River along much of its present course flows in a\r\nvertical-walled canyon with limestone rims. The Canadian River, flowing\r\neastward from the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, has cut a deep canyon\r\nalong the northern part of the Pecos Valley section. The sharp rims of\r\nthe Dakota Sandstone at the Canadian escarpment, north of the Canadian\r\nRiver, form the northern boundary of the Pecos Valley section.\r\n\r\nThe sharp, northeast-trending broken flexure called the Border Hills\r\nthat is crossed by U. S. Highway 70-380 about 20 miles west of Roswell\r\nis a unique landform of the Pecos Valley. This markedly linear upfolded\r\n(anticlinal) structure forms a ridge more than 30 miles long and about\r\n200 feet high.\r\n\r\nAs in the Colorado Plateau, windblown sand and silt mantle the landscape\r\nin many places, but the greatest accumulations are along the base of the\r\nMescalero escarpment at the northeast and southeast corners of the Pecos\r\nValley section.\r\n\r\nEast of the Pecos River, in the southeast part of the Pecos Valley, the\r\nunderlying rocks have yielded much oil and potash. Oil fields are common\r\neast of Artesia and Carlsbad, and potash is mined east of Carlsbad.\r\n\r\nThe Pecos and Canadian Rivers and their tributaries have created the\r\ngeneral outline of the landscape of the Pecos Valley, but underground\r\nsolution of limestone by ground water and the collapse of roofs of these\r\ncavities have contributed much detail to the surface that characterizes\r\nthe Pecos Valley today.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            EDWARDS PLATEAU\r\n\r\nSouth of the Pecos Valley section, the Pecos River continues its journey\r\nto the Rio Grande in a steep-walled canyon cut 400 to 500 feet below the\r\nlevel of a plateau surface of Cretaceous limestone from which little has\r\nbeen stripped except a thin Tertiary cover of Ogallala Formation (fig.\r\n30). To the east, the plateau has been similarly incised by the Devils\r\nRiver and the West Nueces and Nueces Rivers. East of the Nueces to the\r\nescarpment formed by the Balcones fault zone, the southern part of the\r\nEdwards Plateau has been intricately dissected by the Frio, Sabinal,\r\nMedina, Guadalupe, and Pedernales Rivers and their tributary systems.\r\nSan Antonio and Austin, Tex., are located on the Coastal Plain at the\r\nedge of the Balcones fault zone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 30.—Rio Grande and the flat-lying limestone\r\nlayers of the Edwards Plateau downstream from the mouth of the Pecos\r\nRiver. Mexico on the left side of picture. Photograph by V. L. Freeman,\r\nU. S. Geological Survey._]\r\n\r\nThe Pecos River, and to a lesser extent the Devils and Nueces Rivers,\r\nparticularly in their lower courses, have entrenched themselves deeply\r\nin the plateau in remarkable meandering courses of a type that is\r\nusually found only in broad, low-lying floodplains. These stream courses\r\nreflect the stream environment prior to regional uplift.\r\n\r\nSinkholes pit the relatively undissected limestone plateau surface in\r\nthe northeast part of the Edwards Plateau, and some underground solution\r\ncavities in the limestone are well-known caves, such as the Caverns of\r\nSonora, southwest of Sonora, Tex.\r\n\r\nOil and gas fields are widely developed in the northern part of the\r\nEdwards Plateau, but only cattle ranches are found in the bare southern\r\npart.\r\n\r\nAncient oceans deposited the limestones that now cap the Edwards\r\nPlateau; streams planed off the surface of the flat-lying limestone\r\nlayers and entrenched themselves in steep-walled valleys; and ground\r\nwater dissolved the limestone and created the solution cavities that are\r\nthe caves and sinks of the Edwards Plateau. Water has created this\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PLAINS BORDER SECTION\r\n\r\nThe Missouri Plateau, the Colorado Piedmont, the Pecos Valley, and the\r\nEdwards Plateau all were outlined by streams that flowed from the\r\nmountains. On the eastern border of the Great Plains, however, headward\r\ncutting by streams that have their source areas in the High Plains has\r\ndissected a large area, mainly in Kansas. This Plains Border Section\r\ncomprises a number of east-trending river valleys—of the Republican,\r\nSolomon, Saline, Smoky Hill, Arkansas, Medicine Lodge, Cimarron, and\r\nNorth Canadian Rivers—and interstream divides, most of which are\r\nintricately dissected.\r\n\r\nNorth of the Arkansas River, the east-flowing Republican, Solomon,\r\nSaline, and Smoky Hill Rivers have incised themselves a few hundred feet\r\nbelow the Tertiary High Plains surface and have developed systems of\r\nclosely spaced tributary draws. The interstream divides are narrow, and\r\nthe tributary heads nearly meet at the divides. This intricately\r\ndissected part of the Plains Border section is called the Smoky Hills.\r\nSome isolated buttes of Cretaceous rocks left in the upper valley of the\r\nSmoky Hill River are called the Monument Rocks. A large area of rounded\r\nboulders exposed by erosion south of the Solomon River, southwest of\r\nMinneapolis, Kans., is called “Rock City.” These boulders originated as\r\nresistant nodules (concretions) within the Cretaceous rocks that\r\ncontained them.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Arkansas River is a broad, nearly flat upland sometimes\r\nreferred to as the Great Bend Plains. The Medicine Lodge River has cut\r\nheadward into the southeastern part of the Great Bend Plains and created\r\na thoroughly dissected topography in Triassic red rocks that is locally\r\ncalled the Red Hills. In a few places, badlands have formed in the Red\r\nHills.\r\n\r\nSome large sinks or collapse depressions have formed because of solution\r\nof salt and gypsum at depth by ground water. Big and Little Basins, in\r\nClark County in south-central Kansas, were formed in this way.\r\n\r\nSand dunes have accumulated in places, especially near stream valleys.\r\nDunes are common, for example, along the north side of the North\r\nCanadian River.\r\n\r\nOil and gas fields are widely developed in the southeast part of the\r\nPlains Border section—in the Smoky Hills, the Great Bend Plains, and the\r\nRed Hills.\r\n\r\nThe Plains Border section, like the Missouri Plateau, the Colorado\r\nPiedmont, and the Pecos Valley, is primarily a product of stream\r\ndissection. The differences in the outstanding landforms of the section\r\nare mainly the result of differences in the hardness of the eroded\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EPILOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Great Plains, as we have seen, is many things. It contains thick\r\nlayers of rock that formed in oceans, and younger layers of rocks\r\ndeposited by streams. These rocks have been affected by earth movements\r\nand injected by hot molten rock, some of which reached the surface as\r\nvolcanic rock. The rocks have been carved by streams, dissolved by\r\nground water, partly covered by glaciers, and blown by winds. All of\r\nthese agents have played important roles in determining the landscape\r\nand the landforms of the Great Plains. But the streams were the master\r\nagent. They formed the great depositional plain that was to become the\r\nGreat Plains, and then began to destroy it—leaving only the High Plains\r\nto remind us of what it was. Those long miles we travel across the High\r\nPlains are a journey through history—geologic history.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis narrative history of geologic and biologic events in the Great\r\nPlains had its origin in a study intended to identify potential National\r\nNatural Landmarks in the Great Plains, commissioned by the National Park\r\nService. William A. Cobban, G. Edward Lewis, and Reuben J. Ross of the\r\nU. S. Geological Survey were collaborators in that study, and some of\r\ntheir contributions to the history of life on the Great Plains have been\r\nincorporated into this narrative, which was undertaken at the urging of\r\nWallace R. Hansen.\r\n\r\nThe photographic illustrations, other than those obtained from the film\r\nlibrary of the U. S. Geological Survey, were provided by the interest\r\nand effort of my friends and colleagues of the Geological\r\nSurvey—including C. R. Dunrud, V. L. Freeman, C. D. Miller, R. D.\r\nMiller, F. W.
