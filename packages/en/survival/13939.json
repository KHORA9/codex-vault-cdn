Its length\r\nis 480 ft. 6 in., and the width of the platform is 15 ft., the gauge of\r\nthe railway being 3 ft. 6 in. The central span of the viaduct is an arch\r\nof 220 ft. span between abutments, and about 90 ft. height; the remainder\r\nof the space on each side is divided into two spans by an iron pier at a\r\ndistance of 68 ft. from the retaining wall. These piers are 36 ft. 2 in.\r\nhigh, and carry girders 144 ft. long, balanced each on a pivot in the\r\ncenter. One end of these girders is secured to the retaining walls by\r\nmeans of horizontal and vertical anchorages, while the other end rests in\r\na sliding bearing on the top flange of the arch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE BLAAUW KRANTZ RAVINE, CAPE COLONY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE BLAAUW KRANTZ RAVINE, CAPE COLONY.]\r\n\r\nIn designing the structure the following points had to be considered: (1)\r\nThat, on account of the great height above the ground, and on account of\r\nthe high price of timber at the site, the structure could be easily\r\nerected without the use of scaffolding supporting it as a whole. (2) That,\r\non account of the high freights to Port Alfred, the quantity of iron in\r\nthe structure should be as small as possible. (3) That the single parts of\r\nthe principal span should be easy to lift, and that there should be as few\r\nof them as possible. For this latter reason most of them were made in\r\nlengths of 20 ft. and more. The question of economy of material presented\r\nitself as a comparison between a few standard types, viz., the girder\r\nbridge of small independent spans; the cantilever bridge, or the\r\ncontinuous girder bridge in three large spans; the single girder bridge\r\nwith one large span and several small spans; and the arch with small\r\ngirder spans on each side. The suspension bridge was left out of question\r\nas inadmissible. A girder bridge with small independent spans on rocker\r\npiers would probably have been the most economical, even taking into\r\naccount the great height of the piers near the middle of the ravine, but\r\nthere would have been some difficulty in holding those piers in position\r\nuntil they could be secured to the girders at the top; and, moreover, such\r\na structure would have been strikingly out of harmony with the character\r\nof the site. On the other hand, a cantilever or continuous girder bridge\r\nin three spans--although such structures have been erected in similar\r\nlocalities--could not enter into comparison of simple economy of material,\r\nbecause such a design would entirely disregard the anomaly that the\r\ngreater part of the structure, viz., the side spans, being necessarily\r\nconstructed to carry across a large space, would be too near the ground to\r\njustify the omission of further supports. The question was, therefore,\r\nnarrowed to a comparison between the present arch and a central\r\nindependent girder of the same span, including the piers on which it\r\nrests. The small side spans could obviously be left out in each case. The\r\ncomparison was made with a view not only to arrive at a decision in this\r\nparticular case, but also of answering the question of the economy of the\r\narch more generally. The following table contains the weights of\r\ngeometrically similar structures of three different spans, of which the\r\nsecond is the one here described. The so-called theoretical weight is that\r\nwhich the structure would have if no part required stiffening, leaving out\r\nalso all connections and all wind bracing. The moving load is taken at one\r\nton per foot lineal, and the strain on the iron at an average of four tons\r\nper square inch. The proportion of the girder is taken at 1 in 8.\r\n\r\n--------------+-----------------------+------------------------+\r\n              |  Theoretical Weight.  |      Total Weight.     |\r\nSpan in Feet. +-----------------------+------------------------|\r\n              |  Arch.  |   Girder.   |     Arch.  |   Girder. |\r\n--------------+---------+-------------+------------+-----------|\r\n     100      | 0.0724  |   0.1663    |    0.1866  |   0.2443  |\r\n     220      | 0.1659  |   0.4109    |    0.4476  |   0.7462  |\r\n     300      | 0.2414  |   0.6445    |    0.6464  |   1.2588  |\r\n--------------+---------+-------------+------------+-----------+\r\n              |<------------Tons per foot lineal.------------->|\r\n\r\nIt can be seen from these results that the economical advantage of the\r\narch increases with the span. In small arches this advantage would not be\r\nlarge enough to counterbalance the greater cost of manufacture; but in the\r\narch of 220 ft. span the advantage is already very marked. If the table\r\nwere continued, it would show that the girder, even if the platform were\r\nartificially widened, would become impossible at a point where the arch\r\ncan still be made without difficulty. The calculations leading to the\r\nabove results would occupy too much space to make it desirable on this\r\noccasion to produce them. Our two views are from photographs.--_The\r\nEngineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTORPEDO SHIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommander Gallwey lately delivered an interesting lecture on the use of\r\ntorpedoes in war before the royal U.S. Institution, London, discussed\r\nH.M.S. Polyphemus, and urged as arguments in her favor: 1. That she has\r\nvery high speed, combined with fair maneuvering powers. 2. That she can\r\ndischarge her torpedoes with certainty either ahead or on the beam when\r\nproceeding at full speed. 3. That her crew and weapons of defense are\r\nprotected by the most perfect of all armor possible, namely, 10 ft. of\r\nwater. 4. That she only presents a mark of 4 ft. above the water line.\r\n\r\nThen, he asked, with what weapon is the ironclad going to vanquish these\r\ntorpedo rams? Guns cannot hit her when moving at speed; she is proof\r\nagainst machine guns, and, being smaller, handier, and faster than most\r\nironclads, should have a better chance with her ram, the more especially\r\nas it is provided with a weapon which has been scores of times discharged\r\nwith certainty at 300 yards. The ironclad, he answered, must use\r\ntorpedoes, and then he maintained that the speed and handiness of the\r\nPolyphemus would enable her to place herself in positions where she could\r\nuse her own torpedo to advantage, and be less likely to be hit herself. He\r\nthen called attention to the necessity for well-protected conning towers\r\nin these ships, and prophesied that if a submarine ship, armed with\r\ntorpedoes, be ever built, she will be the most formidable antagonist an\r\nironclad ever had; and the nearer the special torpedo ship approaches this\r\ndesideratum the better she will be.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLUMBING TEST.\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent trial of a smoke rocket for testing drains, described by Mr.\r\nCosmo Jones in the _Journal of the Society of Arts_, is deserving of\r\ninterest. The one fixed upon is 10 in. long, 2½ in. in diameter, and with\r\nthe composition \"charged rather hard,\" so as to burn for ten minutes. This\r\ngives the engineer time to light the fuse, insert the rocket in the drain,\r\ninsert a plug behind it, and walk through the house to see if the smoke\r\nescapes into it at any point, finishing on the roof, where he finds the\r\nsmoke issuing in volumes from the ventilating pipes. The house\r\nexperimented upon had three ventilating pipes, and the smoke issued in\r\ndense masses from each of them, but did not escape anywhere into the\r\nhouse, showing that the pipes were sound. If the engineer wishes to\r\nincrease the severity of the test, he throws a wet cloth over the top of\r\nthe ventilating pipe, and so gets a slight pressure of smoke inside it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GAS ENGINE.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lecture by Mr. Dugald Clerk, before the Literary and\r\nPhilosophical Society, Oldham.]\r\n\r\nBy DUGALD CLERK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn earlier days of mechanics, before the work of the great Scottish\r\nengineer, James Watt, the crude steam engines of the time were known as\r\n\"fire engines,\" not in the sense in which we now apply the term to\r\nmachines for the extinguishing of fires, but as indicating the source from\r\nwhich the power was derived, motive power engines deriving their vitality\r\nand strength from fire. The modern name--steam engine--to some extent is a\r\nmisleading one, distracting the mind from the source of power to the\r\nmedium which conveys the power. Similarly the name \"Gas Engine\" masks the\r\nfact of the motors so called being really fire or heat engines.\r\n\r\nThe gas engine is more emphatically a \"fire engine\" than ever the steam\r\nengine has been. In it the fire is not tamed or diluted by indirect\r\ncontact with water, but it is used direct; the fire, instead of being kept\r\nto the boiler room, is introduced direct into the motor cylinder of the\r\nengine. This at first sight looks very absurd and impracticable;\r\ndifficulties at once become apparent of so overwhelming a nature that the\r\nproblem seems almost an impossible one; yet this is what has been\r\nsuccessfully accomplished in the gas engine. Engineers accustomed to the\r\nconstruction of steam engines would not many years ago have considered any\r\none proposing such a thing as having taken leave of his senses.\r\n\r\nThe late Sir William Siemens worked for many years on combustion engines,\r\nsome of his patents on this subject dating back to 1860. In the course of\r\na conversation I had with him on the subject of his earlier patents, I\r\nasked him why he had entitled one of those patents \"steam engine\r\nimprovements\" when it was wholly concerned with a gas engine using\r\nhydrogen and air in the motive cylinder, the combustion of the hydrogen\r\ntaking place in the motive cylinder. He answered me that in 1860 he did\r\nnot care to entitle his patent gas or combustion engine simply because\r\nengineers at that time would have thought him mad.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this widespread incredulity among engineers, and the\r\napparent novelty of the gas engine idea, fire or combustion engines have\r\nbeen proposed long, long ago. The first Newcomen steam engine ever set to\r\nwork was used by a Mr. Back, of Wolverhampton, in the year 1711.\r\nThirty-one years before this time, in Paris--year 1680--Huyghens presented\r\na memoir to the Academy of Sciences describing a method of utilizing the\r\nexpansive force of gunpowder. This engineer is notable as being the very\r\nfirst to propose the use of a cylinder and piston, as well as the first\r\ncombustion engine of a practical kind.\r\n\r\nThe engine consists of a vertical open topped cylinder, in which works a\r\npiston; the piston is connected by a chain passing over a pulley above it\r\nto a heavy weight; the upstroke is accomplished by the descent of the\r\nweight, which pulls the piston to the top of the cylinder; gunpowder\r\nplaced in a tray at the bottom of the cylinder is now ignited, and expels\r\nthe air with which the cylinder is filled through a shifting valve, and,\r\nafter the products of combustion have cooled, a partial vacuum takes place\r\nand the atmospheric pressure forces down the piston to the bottom of its\r\nstroke, during which work may be obtained.\r\n\r\nOn the board I have made a sketch of this engine. Some years previous to\r\nHuyghens' proposal, the Abbe Hautefeuille (1678) proposed a gunpowder\r\nengine without piston for pumping water. It is similar to Savery's steam\r\nengine, but using the pressure of the explosion instead of the pressure of\r\nsteam. This engine, however, had no piston, and was only applicable as a\r\npump. The Savery principle still survives in the action of the well-known\r\npulsometer steam pump.\r\n\r\nDenys Papin, the pupil and assistant of Huyghens, continued experimenting\r\nupon the production of motive power, and in 1690 published a description\r\nof his attempts at Leipzig, entitled \"A New Method of Securing Cheaply\r\nMotive Power of Considerable Magnitude.\"\r\n\r\nHe mentions the gunpowder engine, and states that \"until now all\r\nexperiments have been unsuccessful; and after the combustion of the\r\nexploded powder there always remains in the cylinder one-fifth of its\r\nvolume of air.\"\r\n\r\nFor the explosion of the gunpowder he substituted the generation and\r\ncondensation of steam, heating the bottom of his cylinder by a fire; a\r\nsmall quantity of water contained in it was vaporized, and then on\r\nremoving the fire the steam condensed and the piston was forced down. This\r\nwas substantially the Newcomen steam engine, but without the separate\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nPapin died about the year 1710, a disappointed man, about the same time as\r\nNewcomen. Thomas Newcomen, ironmonger and blacksmith, of Dartmouth,\r\nEngland, had first succeeded in getting his engine to work. The hard fight\r\nto wrest from nature a manageable motive power and to harness fire for\r\nindustrial use was continued by this clever blacksmith, and he succeeded\r\nwhen the more profound but less constructively skillful philosophers had\r\nfailed.\r\n\r\nThe success of the steam method and the fight necessary to perfect it to\r\nthe utmost absorbed the energy of most able engineers--Beighton, John\r\nSmeaton--accomplishing much in applying and perfecting it before the\r\nappearance of James Watt upon the scene.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that in England alone over 2,000 horse power of\r\nNewcomen engines were at work before Watt commenced his series of\r\nmagnificent inventions; he commenced experimenting on a Newcomen engine\r\nmodel in 1759 at Glasgow University, and in 1774 came to Birmingham,\r\nentered into partnership with Boulton, and 1781 we find his beautiful\r\ndouble acting beam condensing engine in successful work.\r\n\r\nFrom that time until now the steam engine has steadily advanced,\r\nincreasing in economy of fuel from 10 lb. of coal per horse power per hour\r\nto about 1¾ lb. per horse power per hour, which is the best result of\r\nto-day's steam engine practice. This result, according to the highest\r\nauthorities, is so near to the theoretical result possible from a steam\r\nengine that further improvement cannot now be looked for. Simultaneously\r\nwith the development of the steam engine, inventors continued to struggle\r\nwith the direct acting combustion or gas engine, often without any\r\ndefinite understanding of why they should attempt such apparent\r\nimpossibilities, but always by their experiments and repeated failures\r\nincreasing knowledge, and forming a firm road upon which those following\r\nthem traveled to success.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 John Barber obtained a patent for an engine producing inflammable\r\ngas, mixing it with air, igniting it, and allowing the current so produced\r\nto impinge upon a reaction wheel, producing motion similar to the well\r\nknown Aelopile, which I have at work upon the table. About this time,\r\nMurdoch (Jas. Watt's assistant at Birmingham) was busy introducing coal\r\ngas into use for lighting; in 1792 Boulton and Watt's works were lighted\r\nup with coal gas. From this time many gas engines were proposed, and the\r\nmore impracticable combustion of gunpowder received less attention.\r\n\r\nIn 1794 Thomas Mead obtained a patent for an engine using the internal\r\ncombustion of gas; the description is not a clear one, his ideas seem\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\nIn the same year Robert Street obtained a patent for an engine which is\r\nnot unlike some now in use. The bottom of a cylinder, containing a piston,\r\nis heated by a fire, a few drops of spirits of turpentine are introduced\r\nand evaporated by the heat, the piston is drawn up, and air entering mixes\r\nwith the inflammable vapor. A light is applied at a touch hole, and the\r\nexplosion drives up the piston, which, working on a lever, forces down the\r\npiston of a pump for pumping water. Robt. Street adds to his description a\r\nnote: \"The quantity of spirits of tar or turpentine to be made use of is\r\nalways proportional to the confined space, in general about 10 drops to a\r\ncubic foot.\" This engine is quite a workable one, although the\r\narrangements described are very crude.\r\n\r\nThe first gas engine that was actually at work for some years; and was\r\napplied to a variety of purposes, was Samuel Buren's. His patent was\r\ngranted in 1823, and in 1826 he built a locomotive carriage with which he\r\nmade several experimental runs in London; he also propelled a vessel with\r\nit upon the Thames, and fitted up a large engine for pumping purposes. A\r\ncompany was formed to introduce his engine, but it proved too wasteful of\r\nfuel, and the company went into voluntary liquidation. Like almost all\r\nengines of this time, the combustion of gas and air was used to produce a\r\nvacuum, the piston being driven by atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nBuren's locomotive carriage was thus in action three years before the\r\ngreat trial in 1829, from which George Stephenson emerged victorious with\r\nhis wonderful engine \"The Rocket.\" To those curious in the matter, I may\r\nmention that S. Buren's patents are dated 1823, No. 4,874, and 1826, No.\r\n5,350.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on, a continuous series of gas engine patents appear, 20\r\nengines being patented between 1826 and 1860, which is the next date\r\nworthy of particular mention.\r\n\r\nIn this year, 1860, the famous \"Lenoir\" engine appeared. The use of high\r\npressure steam engines had long been common, and Lenoir's engine was\r\nanalogous to the high pressure engine, as Buren's was to the condensing\r\nengine. It created a very general interest, and many engines were\r\nconstructed and used in France, England, and America; it resembled very\r\nmuch in external appearance an ordinary high pressure horizontal steam\r\nengine, and it was double acting.\r\n\r\nDuring the following six years, other 20 British patents were granted, and\r\nthe gas engine passed from the state of a troublesome toy to a practicable\r\nand widely useful machine.\r\n\r\nFrom 1791 to the end of 1866, in all 46 British patents were granted for\r\ngas engines, and in these patents are to be found the principles upon\r\nwhich the gas engines of to-day are constructed, many years elapsing\r\nbefore experience enough was gained to turn the proposals of the older\r\ninventors to practical account.\r\n\r\nThe most important of these patents are:\r\n\r\n                      No.  Year.\r\nRobert Street         1,983 1794  Direct-acting engine.\r\nSamuel Buren          4,874 1823  Vacuum engine.\r\nSamuel Buren          5,350 1826  Vacuum engine.\r\nW.L.

Siemens          2,074 1860  Compression, _constant\r\n                                    pressure_.\r\nHugon                 2,902 1860  Platinum ignition.\r\nMillein               1,840 1861  Compression, both constant vol. and\r\n                                    _pressure_.\r\nF.H.

The reason of departure is very obvious: a gunpowder explosion and a\r\ngaseous explosion differ in very important practical points.\r\n\r\nGunpowder being a solid substance is capable of being packed into a very\r\nsmall space; the gas evolved by its decomposition is so great in volume\r\nthat, even in the absence of any evolution of heat, a very high pressure\r\nwould result. One cubic inch of gunpowder confined in a space of one cubic\r\ninch would cause a pressure by the gas it contains alone of 15,000 lb. per\r\nsquare inch; if the heating effect be allowed for, pressures of four times\r\nthat amount, or 60,000 lb. per square inch, are easily accounted for.\r\nThese pressures are far too high for use in any engine, and the bare\r\npossibility of getting such pressure by accident put gunpowder quite\r\noutside the purpose of the engineer, quite apart from any question of\r\ncomparative cost. In a proper mixture of inflammable gas and air is found\r\nan exceedingly safe explosive, perfectly manageable and quite incapable of\r\nproducing pressures in any sense dangerous to a properly constructed\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nThe pressure produced by the explosion of any mixture of gas and air is\r\nstrictly determined and limited, whereas the pressure produced by the\r\nexplosion of gunpowder depends greatly upon the relation between the\r\nvolume of the gunpowder and the space in which it is confined.\r\n\r\nEngines of the \"Lenoir\" type are the simplest in idea and construction; in\r\nthem a mixture of gas and air is made in the cylinder during the first\r\nhalf of the piston stroke, air being taken from the atmosphere and drawn\r\ninto the cylinder by the forward movement of the piston. At the same time\r\ngas entering by a number of holes, and streaming into the air to form an\r\nexplosive mixture, the movement of a valve cuts off the supply, and brings\r\nthe igniting arrangement into action. The pressure produced by the\r\nexplosion acting upon the piston makes it complete its stroke, when the\r\nexhaust valve opens exactly as in the steam engine. The Lenoir and Hugon\r\nengines, the earlier forms of this type, were double acting, receiving two\r\nimpulses for every revolution of the crank, the impulse differing from\r\nthat in a high pressure steam engine in commencing at half stroke.\r\n\r\nThe Lenoir igniting arrangement was complicated and troublesome. I have it\r\nupon the table; the mixture was ignited at the proper time by the electric\r\nspark produced from a primary battery and Ruhmkorff coil.\r\n\r\nThe Hugon engine was an advance in this respect, using a flame ignited,\r\nand securing greater certainty of action in a comparatively simple manner.\r\n\r\nIt is really a modification of Barnett's lighting cock described in his\r\npatent of 1838.\r\n\r\nOther difficulties were found in using these engines; the pistons became\r\nexceedingly hot. In the case of the Lenoir larger engines, it sometimes\r\nbecame red hot, and caused complete ruin of the cylinder by scoring and\r\ncutting up. Hugon to prevent this injected some water.\r\n\r\nIn the all important question of economy, these engines were found\r\ngrievously wanting, Lenoir consuming 95 cubic feet per I.H.P. per hour;\r\nHugon consuming 85 cubic feet per I.H.P. per hour.\r\n\r\nThe surviving engines of this type are only used for very small powers,\r\nfrom one to four man power, or 1/8 to 1/2 horse, the most widely known of\r\nthis kind being the \"Bischoff,\" which is very largely used; its\r\nconsumption of gas is even greater than the Lenoir, being 110 cubic feet\r\nper horse power per hour, as tested with a half-horse engine at a late\r\nexhibition of gas apparatus at Stockport.\r\n\r\nSo large a consumption of gas prevented these engines coming into extended\r\nuse for engines of moderate power, and led inventors to work to obtain\r\nbetter results. The force generated by the explosion of a mixture of gas\r\nand air is very short lived, and if it is to be fully utilized must be\r\nused quickly; a high pressure is produced, but it very quickly disappears.\r\n\r\nThe quicker the piston moves after the maximum pressure is reached, the\r\nless will be the loss of heat to the sides of the cylinder. The flame\r\nwhich fills the cylinder and causes the increase of pressure rapidly loses\r\nheat, and the pressure falls.\r\n\r\nThe idea of using a free piston was proposed as a remedy; it was thought\r\nthat a piston connected to a crank in the ordinary manner could not move\r\nfast enough to utilize the pressure before it was lost. Many inventors\r\nproposed to perform work upon a piston free from any direct connection\r\nwith the crank or shaft of the engine; the explosion after attaining its\r\nmaximum pressure expends its force in giving velocity to a piston; the\r\nvelocity so acquired carries it on against atmospheric pressure until the\r\nenergy is all absorbed, and a vacuum or deficit of pressure exists in the\r\ncylinder instead of an excess of pressure. The return stroke is\r\naccomplished by the atmospheric pressure, and the work is now done upon\r\nthe engine shaft on the return only. The method of connecting on the\r\nreturn stroke while leaving the piston free on the out stroke varies, but\r\nin many engines the principle was the same.\r\n\r\nBarsante and Matteucci, year 1857, British patent No. 1,625, describe the\r\nfirst engine of this kind, but Messrs. Otto and Langen were the first to\r\nsuccessfully overcome all difficulties and make a marketable engine of it.\r\nTheir patent was dated 1866, No. 434. To distinguish it from Otto's later\r\npatents, it may be called the rack and clutch engine.\r\n\r\nThe economy obtained by this engine was a great advance upon the Lenoir.\r\nAccording to a test by Prof. Tresca, at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, the\r\ngas consumed was 44 cubic feet per indicated horse power per hour.\r\nAccording to tests I have made myself in Manchester with a two horse power\r\nengine, Otto and Langen's free piston engine consumes 40 cubic feet per\r\nI.H.P. per hour. This is less than one-half of the gas used by the Hugon\r\nengine for one horse power.\r\n\r\nThe igniting arrangement is a very good modification of Barnett's lighting\r\ncock, which I have explained already, but a slide valve is used instead of\r\na cock.\r\n\r\nOther engines carried out the same principle in a different manner,\r\nincluding Gilles' engine, but they were not commercially so successful as\r\nthe Otto and Langen. Mr. F.H. Wenham's engine was of this type, and was\r\nworking in England, Mr. Wenham informed me, in 1866, his patent being\r\ntaken out in 1864.\r\n\r\nThe great objection to this kind of engine is the irregularity and great\r\nnoise in working; this was so great as to prevent engines from being made\r\nlarger than three horse power. The engine, however, did good work, and was\r\nlargely used from 1866 until the end of 1876, when Mr. Otto produced his\r\nfamous engine, now known as \"The Otto Silent Gas Engine.\" In this engine\r\ngreat economy is attained without the objectionable free piston by a\r\nmethod proposed first by Burnett, 1838, and also by a Frenchman, Millein,\r\nin 1861; this method is compression before ignition. Other inventors also\r\ndescribed very clearly the advantages to be expected from compression, but\r\nnone were able to make it commercially successful till Mr. Otto. To him\r\nbelongs the great credit of inventing a cycle of operations capable of\r\nrealizing compression in a simple manner.\r\n\r\nStarting from the same point as inventors did to produce the free piston\r\nengine--namely, that the more quickly the explosive force is utilized, the\r\nless will be the loss, and the greater the power produced from a quantity\r\nof burning gas--it is evident that if any method can be discovered to\r\nincrease the pressure upon the piston without increasing the temperature\r\nof the flame causing this pressure, then a great gain will result, and\r\nthe engine will convert more of the heat given to it into work. This is\r\nexactly what is done by compression before ignition. Suppose we take a\r\nmixture of gas and air of such proportions as to cause when exploded, or\r\nrather ignited (because explosion is too strong a term), a pressure of 45\r\nlb. above atmosphere, or 60 lb. per square inch absolute pressure. Then\r\nthis mixture, if compressed to half volume before igniting and kept at\r\nconstant temperature, would give, when ignited, a pressure of 120 lb.\r\ntotal, or 105 lb. above atmosphere, and this without any increase of the\r\ntemperature of the flame.\r\n\r\nThe effect of compression is to make a small piston do the work of a large\r\none, and convert more heat into work by lessening the loss of heat through\r\nthe walls of the cylinder. In addition to this advantage, greater\r\nexpansions are made possible, and therefore greatly increase economy.\r\n\r\nThe Otto engine must be so familiar in appearance to all of you, that I\r\nneed hardly trouble you with details of its external appearance. I shall\r\nbriefly describe its action. Its strong points and its weak points are\r\nalike caused by its cycle. One cylinder and piston suffices to carry out\r\nits whole action. Its cycle is: First outstroke, gas and air sucked into\r\nthe cylinder; first instroke, gas and air compressed into space; second\r\noutstroke, impulse due to ignition; second instroke, discharge of\r\nexhausted gases. When working at full power, it gets one impulse for every\r\ntwo revolutions; this seems to be a retrograde movement, but,\r\nnotwithstanding, the advantages obtained are very great. The igniting\r\narrangement is in the main similar to that used on the rack and clutch\r\nengine. The engine has been exceedingly successful, and is very\r\neconomical. The Otto compression engine consumes 21 cubic feet of gas per\r\nI.H.P. per hour, and runs with great smoothness.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 I commenced my work upon gas engines, and very soon concluded that\r\nthe compression system was the true line to proceed upon. It took me two\r\nyears to produce a workable engine. My efforts have always been directed\r\ntoward producing an engine giving at least one impulse every revolution\r\nand, if possible, to start without hand labor, just as a steam engine\r\ndoes. My first gas engine was running in 1878, and patented and exhibited\r\nin 1879. It was first exhibited at the Kilburn Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety's show.\r\n\r\nThis engine was self-starting, gave an ignition at every revolution, and\r\nignited without external flame. It consisted of two cylinders, a motor,\r\nand a compressing pump, with a small intermediate reservoir. Suitable\r\nvalves introduced the mixture of gas and air into the pump, and passed it\r\nwhen compressed from the reservoir to the motor cylinder. The igniting\r\narrangement consisted of a platinum cage firmly fixed in a valve port;\r\nthis cage was heated in the first instance by a flame of gas and air\r\nmixed; it became white hot in a few seconds, and then the engine was\r\nstarted by opening a valve.\r\n\r\nThe platinum was kept hot by the heat derived from the successive\r\nignitions, and, the engine once started, no further external flame was\r\nrequired. I have here one of these platinum cages which has been in use.\r\nFinding this method not well suited for small engines, I produced the\r\nengine which is at present in the market under my name.\r\n\r\nThe cycle is different, and is designed for greater simplicity and the\r\navoidance of back ignitions. It also consists of two cylinders, motor\r\ncylinder and the displace or charging cylinder. There is no intermediate\r\nreservoir. The displace crank leads the motor by a right angle, and takes\r\ninto it the mixed charge of gas and air, in some cases taking air alone\r\nduring the latter part of its stroke.\r\n\r\nThe motor on the outstroke crosses V-shaped parts about from one-sixth to\r\none-seventh from the out end, the displacer charge now passing into the\r\nmotor cylinder, displacing the exhaust gases by these ports and filling\r\nthe cylinder and the space at the end of it with the explosive mixture.\r\nThe introduction of some air in advance of the charge serves the double\r\npurpose of cooling down the exhaust gases and preventing direct contact of\r\nthe inflammable mixture with flame which may linger in the cylinder from\r\nthe previous stroke. The instroke of the motor compresses the charge into\r\nthe conical space at the end of the cylinder, and, when fully compressed,\r\nignition is effected by means of the slide I have upon the table.\r\n\r\nThis system of ignition has been found very reliable, and capable of\r\nacting as often as 400 times per minute, which the Otto ignite is quite\r\nincapable of doing. By this cycle the advantages of compression are gained\r\nand one step nearer to the steam engine is attained, that is, an impulse\r\nis given for every revolution of the engine.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, I am able with my engine to give a greater amount of\r\npower for a comparatively small weight. In addition to this, I have\r\nintroduced a method of self-starting; in this I believe I was the\r\nfirst--about 100 of my engines are now using self-starting.\r\n\r\nThe largest single engine I have yet made indicates 30 H.P. The\r\nconsumption of gas in Glasgow is: Clerk engine consumes in Glasgow 18\r\ncubic feet per I.H.P. per hour; Clerk engine consumes in Manchester 22\r\ncubic feet per I.H.P. per hour. So far as I know, the Otto engine and my\r\nown are the only compression engines which have as yet made any success in\r\nthe market. Other engines are being continually prepared, gas engine\r\npatents being taken out just now at the rate of 60 per annum, but none of\r\nthem have been able as yet to get beyond the experimental stage. The\r\nreason is simply the great experience necessary to produce these machines,\r\nwhich seem so very simple; but to the inexperienced inventor the subject\r\nfairly bristles with pitfalls.\r\n\r\nI have here sections of some of the earlier engines, including Dr.\r\nSiemens' and Messrs. Simon and Beechy. Although interesting and containing\r\nmany good points, these have not been practically successful.\r\n\r\nThe Simon engine is an adaptation of the well-known American petroleum\r\nmotor, the Brayton, the only difference consisting in the use of steam as\r\nwell as flame.\r\n\r\nDr. Siemens worked for some twenty years on gas engines, but he aimed\r\nrather high at first to attain even moderate success. Had he lived, I\r\ndoubt not but that he would have succeeded in introducing them for large\r\npowers. In 1882 he informed me that he had in hand a set of gas engines of\r\nsome hundreds of horse power for use on board ship, to be supplied with\r\ngas from one of his gas producers modified to suit the altered\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nSummarizing the ground over which we have passed, we find the origin of\r\nthe gas engine in the minds of the same men as were first to propose the\r\nsteam engine, Huyghens and Papin, 1680 and 1690. Greater mechanical\r\ndifficulties and ignorance of the nature of explosives caused the\r\nabandonment of the internal combustion idea, and the mechanical\r\ndifficulties with steam being less, the steam engine became successful,\r\nand triumphed over its rival. The knowledge and skill gained in the\r\nconstruction of steam engines made it possible once again to attack the\r\nmore difficult problem, and simultaneously with the introduction and\r\nperfecting of the steam engine, the gas engine idea became more and more\r\npossible, the practicable stage commencing with Lenoir and continuing with\r\nHugon, Millein, Otto and Langen, F.H. Wenham, then Otto and Clerk. In\r\n1860, 95 cubic feet of gas produced one horse power for an hour; in 1867,\r\n40 cubic feet accomplished the same thing; and now (1885) we can get one\r\nhorse power for an hour for from 15 to 20 cubic feet of gas, depending on\r\nthe size of the engine used.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a heat engine, the gas engine is now twice as efficient as\r\nthe very best modern steam engine. It is true the fuel used at present\r\nis more expensive than coal, and for large powers the steam engine is\r\nthe best because of this. But the way is clearing to change this. Gas\r\nengines as at present, if supplied with producer gas, produced direct\r\nfrom coal without leaving any coke, as is done in the Siemens, the\r\nWilson, and the Dawson producers, will give power at one-half the cost\r\nof steam power. They will use 7/8 of a pound of coal per horse power per\r\nhour, instead of 1-3/4 lb., as is done in the best steam engines. The\r\nonly producer that makes gas for gas engines at present is the Dawson,\r\nand in it anthracite is used, because of the difficulty of getting rid\r\nof the tar coming from the Siemens and Wilson producers, using any\r\nordinary slack.\r\n\r\nWhen this difficulty has been overcome, and that it will be overcome there\r\ncan be no manner of doubt, gas engines will rapidly displace the steam\r\nengine, because a gas engine with a gas producer, producing gas from any\r\nordinary coal with the same ease as steam is produced from a boiler, will\r\nbe much safer, and will use one-half the fuel of the very best steam\r\nengines for equal power. The first cost also will not be greater than that\r\nof steam. The engine itself will be more expensive than a steam engine of\r\nequal power, but the gas producer will be less expensive than the boiler\r\nat present. Perfect as the gas engine now is, considered as a machine for\r\nconverting heat into work, the possibility of great development is not yet\r\nexhausted. Its economy may be increased two or even three fold; in this\r\nlies the brilliant future before it. The steam engine is nearly as perfect\r\nas it can be made; it approaches very nearly the possibility of its\r\ntheory. Its defect does not lie in its mechanism, but in the very\r\nproperties of water and steam itself. The loss of heat which takes place\r\nin converting liquid water into gaseous steam is so great that by far the\r\ngreater portion of the heat given out by the fuel passes away either in\r\nthe condenser or the exhaust of a steam engine; but a small proportion of\r\nthe heat is converted into work.\r\n\r\nThe very best steam engines convert about 11 per cent. of the heat given\r\nthem into useful work, the remaining 89 per cent. being wasted,\r\nprincipally in the exhaust of the engine.\r\n\r\nGas engines now convert 20 per cent. of the heat given to them into work,\r\nand very probably will, in a few years more, convert 60 per cent. into\r\nuseful work. The conclusion, then, is irresistible that, when engineers\r\nhave gained greater experience with gas engines and gas producers, they\r\nwill displace steam engines entirely for every use--mills, locomotives,\r\nand ships.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAPID CONSTRUCTION OF THE CANADIAN PACIFIC RAILWAY.\r\n\r\nBy E.T. ABBOTT, Member of the Engineers' Club of Minnesota. Read December\r\n12, 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1881 and 1882, the contract was let to Messrs.\r\nLangdon, Sheppard & Co., of Minneapolis, to construct during the working\r\nseason of the latter year, or prior to January 1, 1883, 500 miles of\r\nrailroad on the western extension of the above company; the contract being\r\nfor the grading, bridging, track-laying, and surfacing, also including the\r\nlaying of the necessary depot sidings and their grading. The idea that any\r\nsuch amount of road could be built in that country in that time was looked\r\nupon by the writer hereof, as well as by railroad men generally, as a huge\r\njoke, perpetrated to gull the Canadians. At the time the contract was let,\r\nthe Canadian Pacific Railway was in operation to Brandon, the crossing of\r\nthe Assiniboine River, 132 miles west of Winnipeg. The track was laid,\r\nhowever, to a point about 50 miles west of this, and the grading done\r\ngenerally in an unfinished state for thirty miles further. This was the\r\ncondition of things when the contract was entered into to build 500\r\nmiles--the east end of the 500-mile contract being at Station 4,660\r\n(Station being at Brandon) and extending west to a few miles beyond the\r\nSaskatchewan River.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 1882 opened in the most unpromising manner for railroad\r\noperations, being the wettest ever known in that country. Traffic over the\r\nSt. Paul, Minneapolis & Manitoba Railroad, between St. Paul and Winnipeg,\r\nwas entirely suspended from April 15 to the 28th, owing to the floods on\r\nthe Red River at St. Vincent and Emerson, a serious blow to an early\r\nstart, as on this single track depended the transportation of all\r\nsupplies, men, timber, and contractors' plant, together with all track\r\nmaterials (except ties), all of these things having to come from or\r\nthrough St. Paul and Minneapolis. The writer hereof was appointed a\r\ndivision engineer, and reported at Winnipeg the 15th of April, getting\r\nthrough on the last train before the St. Vincent flood. No sooner was the\r\nline open from St. Paul to Winnipeg than the cotillon opened between\r\nWinnipeg and Brandon, with a succession of washouts that defied and\r\ndefeated all efforts to get trains over, so it was not until the fifth day\r\nof May that I left Winnipeg to take charge of the second division of 30\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nBy extremely \"dizzy\" speed I was landed at the end of the track, 180 miles\r\nfrom Winnipeg, on the evening of the 9th (4 days). My outfit consisted of\r\nthree assistant engineers and the necessary paraphernalia for three\r\ncomplete camps, 30 days' provisions (which turned out to be about 20), 11\r\ncarts and ponies, the latter being extremely poor after a winter's diet\r\non buffalo grass and no grain. On the 18th day of May I had my division\r\norganized and camps in running order. The country was literally under\r\nwater, dry ground being the exception, and I look upon the feat of getting\r\nacross the country at all as the engineering triumph of my life.\r\n\r\nOn May 20 a genuine blizzard set in, lasting 24 hours, snowed five inches,\r\nand froze the sloughs over with half an inch of ice, a decidedly\r\ninteresting event to the writer, as he was 18 miles from the nearest wood,\r\ntherefore lay in his blankets and ate hard tack. I stabled my ponies in\r\nthe cook tent, and after they had literally eaten of the sod inside the\r\ntent, I divided my floor with them.\r\n\r\nOn 28th day of May I saw the first contractor, who broke ground at station\r\n7,150. On the 1st of June I was relieved from this division, and ordered\r\nto take the next, 50 miles west. On the 13th day of June ground was broken\r\non this division, at station 8,070, or only about 62 miles west of the\r\neast end of the 500-mile contract. It looked at this time as though they\r\nmight build 150 miles, but not more. But from this time on very rapid\r\nprogress was made. On July 17 the track reached station 7,000, making\r\nhowever up to this time but about 50 miles of track-laying, including that\r\nlaid on the old grade; but large forces were put on to surfacing, and the\r\ntrack already laid was put in excellent condition for getting material to\r\nthe front. The weather from this until the freezing-up was all that could\r\nbe desired. Work ceased about the 1st of January, 1883, for the season,\r\nand the final estimate for the work was as follows: 6,103,986 cubic yards\r\nearth excavation, 2,395,750 feet B.M. timber in bridges and the culverts,\r\n85,708 lineal feet piling, 435 miles of track-laying. This work was all\r\ndone in 182 working days, including stormy ones, when little, if anything,\r\ncould be done, making a daily average of 33,548 yards excavation, 13,150\r\nfeet B.M. timber, 471 feet piling, 2-38/100 miles track-laying. We never\r\nhad an accurate force report made of the whole line, but roughly there\r\nwere employed 5,000 men and 1,700 teams.\r\n\r\nThe admirable organization of the contractors was something wonderful. The\r\ngrading work was practically all done by sub-contractors, Messrs. Langdon,\r\nSheppard & Co. confining themselves to putting in the supplies and doing\r\nthe bridge work, surfacing, and track-laying. The grading forces were\r\nscattered along about 150 miles ahead of the track and supply stores,\r\nestablished about 50 miles apart, and in no case were sub-contractors\r\nexpected to haul supplies over 100 miles. If I remember rightly, there\r\nwere four trains of about forty wagons each, hauling supplies from the end\r\nof track to the stores.\r\n\r\nAs can be readily seen, the vital point of the whole work, and the problem\r\nto solve, was food for men and horses. 1,700 bushels of oats every day and\r\n15,000 pounds of provisions, Sundays and all, for an entire season, which\r\nat the beginning of the work had to come about 170 miles by rail, and then\r\nbe taken from 50 to 150 miles by teams across a wilderness, is on the face\r\nof it considerable of an undertaking, to say nothing about hauling the\r\npile-drivers, piles, and bridge-timber there. To keep from delaying the\r\ntrack, sidings 1,500 feet long were graded, about 7 miles apart. A\r\nside-track crew, together with an engine, four flats, and caboose, were\r\nalways in readiness; and as soon as a siding was reached, in five hours\r\nthe switches would be in, and the next day it would be surfaced and all in\r\nworking order, when the operating department would fill it with track\r\nmaterial and supplies. From the head of the siding to the end of the track\r\nthe ground was in hands of track-laying engine, never going back of the\r\nlast siding for supplies or material, and my recollection is that there\r\nwere but six hours' delay to the track from lack of material the whole\r\nseason, at any rate up to some time in November. The track-laying crew was\r\nequal to 4 miles per day, and in the month of August 92 miles of track\r\nwere laid. The ties were cut on the line of the road about 100 miles east\r\nof Winnipeg, so the shortest distance any ties were hauled was 270 miles;\r\nthe actual daily burden of the single track from Winnipeg west was 24 cars\r\nsteel, 24 cars ties, aside from the transportation of grain and\r\nprovisions, bridge material, and lumber for station houses. The station\r\nbuildings were kept right up by the company itself, and a depot built with\r\nrooms for the agent every 15 miles, or at every second siding. The\r\nimportance of keeping the buildings up with the track was impressed on the\r\nmind of the superintendent of this branch, and, as a satire, he\r\ntelegraphed asking permission to haul his stuff ahead of the track by\r\nteams, he being on the track-layers' heels with his stations and tanks the\r\nwhole season. The telegraph line was also built, and kept right up to the\r\nend of the track, three or four miles being the furthest they were at any\r\ntime behind.\r\n\r\nIt might be supposed that work done so rapidly would not be well done, but\r\nit is the best built prairie road I know of on this continent. It is built\r\nalmost entirely free from cuts, and the work is at least 20 per cent.\r\nheavier than would ordinarily be made across the same country in the\r\nStates, on account of snow. 2,640 ties were laid to the mile, and the\r\ntrack ballasting kept well up with the laying; so well, in fact, and so\r\nwell done, that as 100 mile sections were completed schedule trains were\r\nput on 20 miles an hour, and the operating department had nothing to do\r\nbut make a time table; the road was _built_ by the construction department\r\nbefore the operating department was asked to take it. The engineering was\r\norganized in divisions of 30 miles each, and as each was finished the\r\nparties moved ahead again to the front, the engineers usually finding men\r\nsitting on their shovels waiting for the work to be laid out for them. It\r\nwas as much as the locating parties could do to keep out of the way of the\r\nconstruction. The roadbed was built 14 ft. wide in embankment and 20 in\r\nthe very few cuts there were, there being no cuts of any moment except\r\nthrough the Coteaus and the Saskatchewan crossing, and these have since\r\nbeen widened out on account of snow, so that the road can be operated the\r\nyear round and the bucking-snow account cut no figure in the operating\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nThe country is a virgin desert. From Winnipeg to the Pacific Ocean there\r\nare a few places that might attain to the dignity of an _oasis_--at\r\nBrandon, Portage la Prairie, etc.--but it is generally what I should call\r\nworthless; 100 miles to wood and 100 feet to water was the general\r\nexperience west of the Moose jaw, and the months of June, July, and August\r\nare the only three in the year that it is safe to bet you will not have\r\nsleighing. I burned wood and used stakes that were hauled by carts 85\r\nmiles, and none any nearer. It is a matter of some pride that both the\r\nengineering and the construction were done by what our Canadian neighbors\r\nkindly termed \"Yankee importations.\" However, there was one thing that in\r\nthe building of this road was in marked contrast to any other Pacific road\r\never constructed, that is, there was no lawlessness, no whisky, and not\r\neven a knock-down fight that I ever heard of the whole season, and even in\r\nthe midst of 12,000 Indians, all armed with Winchester rifles and plenty\r\nof ammunition, not one of the locating or construction parties ever had a\r\nmilitary escort, nor were any depredations ever committed, except the\r\nrunning off of a few horses, which were usually recovered; and I think\r\nthere were but two fatal accidents during the season, one man killed on\r\nthe Grand Coule Bridge, and another from being kicked by a horse.\r\n\r\nThe track was all laid from one end, and in no case were rails hauled\r\nahead by teams. Two iron cars were used, the empty returning one being\r\nturned up beside the track to let the loaded one by.\r\n\r\nThe feat in rapid construction accomplished by this company will never be\r\nduplicated, done as it was by a reckless expenditure of money, the orders\r\nto the engineers being to _get there_ regardless of expense and\r\nhorse-flesh; if you killed a horse by hard driving, his harness would fit\r\nanother, and there was no scrutiny bestowed on vouchers when the work was\r\ndone; and I must pay the tribute to the company to say that everything\r\nthat money would buy was sent to make the engineers comfortable. It was\r\nbad enough at best, and the Chief Engineer (J.C. James) rightly considered\r\nthat any expense bestowed on the engineering part of the work was a good\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OSGOOD MAMMOTH EXCAVATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying illustration, we present to our readers a mammoth\r\nexcavator, built by the Osgood Dredge Company of Albany, N.Y., for the\r\nPacific Guano Company of California, for uncovering their phosphate\r\ndeposits on Chisholm Island, South Colombia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OSGOOD MAMMOTH EXCAVATOR.]\r\n\r\nIn order to bring out more clearly the principal problem involved in the\r\nconstruction of this machine, we shall state first the proposed method of\r\nits operation. This is as follows, viz.: The excavator is to dig a trench\r\nthirty feet wide, down to the phosphate rock, and the entire length of the\r\nbed--about one quarter of a mile--dumping the earth of the first cut to\r\none side. The phosphate is taken out behind the excavator. On reaching the\r\nend of the bed, the excavator is reversed and starts back, making a second\r\ncut thirty feet wide, and dumping now into the cut from which the\r\nphosphate has just been removed. In this way the entire bed is traversed,\r\nthe excavator turning over the earth in great furrows thirty feet wide,\r\nand giving an opportunity to simultaneously get out all the phosphate.\r\n\r\nAs will be seen, the main problem presented was to turn the car around at\r\neach end of the cut in a very limited space. To accomplish this, the car\r\nis mounted on a fixed axle at each end and on a truck under its center of\r\ngravity; this is somewhat forward of the geometrical center of the car.\r\nThe frame of the truck is circular, thirteen feet in diameter, made of I\r\nbeams curved to shape. The circle carries a track, on which a ring of\r\nconed rollers revolves, which in turn supports the car. By pulling out the\r\ntrack from under both ends of the car, the whole weight is balanced on\r\nthis central turntable truck, thus admitting of the car being turned, end\r\nfor end, within its own length. This method of turning the car, and the\r\nsize of the machine, are the principal features.\r\n\r\nThe car is 40' × 13', with arched truss sides. The track is seven feet\r\ngauge, the spread between tracks 20 feet, the height of the A frame 38\r\nfeet, length of boom 40 feet, swinging in a circle of 30 feet radius, and\r\nthrough two-thirds of the entire circle. It has a steel dipper of 46 cubic\r\nfeet capacity, 1 inch steel chains, 10\" × 12\" double cylinder hoisting\r\nengine, and 6¼\" × 8\" double cylinder reversible crowding engine. The\r\ndrums are fitted with friction clutches. Owing to the great distance at\r\nwhich the dipper is handled, its size is reduced, and because it swings on\r\nthe arc of so large a circle the capacity of this machine is only one-half\r\nof that of the No. 1 excavator built by the Osgood Dredge Company.\r\nNevertheless it will do the work of from 75 to 100 men, since its capacity\r\nis from 800 to 1,000 cubic yards per day, the amount of rock _uncovered_\r\ndepending, of course, upon the depth of earth overlying it. The excavator\r\nwill dump 30 feet from the center line of the car, and 26 feet above the\r\ntrack, which is laid on the rock. Total weight about fifty tons. The crew\r\nrequired for its operation consists of 1 engineer, 1 fireman, 1 craneman,\r\nand 4 to 5 pit men to tend jacks, move track, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration the boiler connections are omitted, also the housing\r\nfor the protection of the crew. The design is characterized by the evident\r\ncare which has been bestowed upon securing simplicity and\r\ndurability.--_American Engineer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OSGOOD EXCAVATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a recent meeting of the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia, Mr. John C.\r\nTrautwine, Jr., exhibited and described drawings of a large land dredge\r\nbuilt by the Osgood Dredge Co., of Albany, New York, for the Pacific Guano\r\nCo., to be used in removing 8 to 15 feet of material from the phosphate\r\nrock at Bull River, S.C.\r\n\r\nThe more prominent features of the machine are the car-body, the water\r\ntank, boiler and engine, the A frame (so-called from its slight\r\nresemblance to the letter A), the boom, the dipper-handle; and the dipper,\r\ndrawings of which were shown and described in detail.\r\n\r\nBefore the excavation is begun, the forward end of the car (the end\r\nnearest the dipper) is lifted clear of the track by means of 3\r\nscrew-jacks. When the machine has excavated as far in advance of itself as\r\nthe length of the boom and that of the dipper-handle will permit, say\r\nabout 8 feet, the car is again lowered to the track, the screw-jacks\r\nremoved, and the car is moved forward about 8 feet by winding the rope\r\nupon the drum, the other end of the rope being attached to any suitable\r\nfixed object near the line of the track. The forward end of the car is\r\nthen again lifted by means of the 3 screw-jacks, and the digging is\r\nresumed. The machine cuts a channel from 25 to 35 feet wide, and deposits\r\nall the dirt upon one side. If necessary, it can dump earth about 25 feet\r\nabove the track. The miners follow in the wake of the machine, getting out\r\nthe phosphate as fast as it is uncovered. When the machine reaches the end\r\nof the field it is lowered to the track and the screw-jacks are removed.\r\nShoes or skids are then placed upon the track, and the wheels of the\r\nturntable are run up on them. This lifts the end wheels clear of the\r\ntrack, so that the car and machine rest entirely upon the turntable. By\r\nnow blocking the turntable wheels and winding up only _one_ of the ropes,\r\nthe car body and the machine are swung around end for end. The digging is\r\nthen resumed in the opposite direction, the temporary track, upon which\r\nthe machine travels, being shifted to one side, so that the second channel\r\nis made alongside of the first. The earth removed in cutting this second\r\nchannel is dumped into the first channel, the phosphate (as stated above)\r\nhaving been first removed.\r\n\r\nThe dipper is of plate steel, and holds 1¾ cubic yards of earth when even\r\nfull.\r\n\r\nThe machine is manned by an engineer, a fireman, and a dipper-tender,\r\nbesides which from five to ten laborers are required. These look after the\r\ntrack, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAPSTAN NAVIGATION ON THE VOLGA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn several of the large rivers on the Continent, with rapid currents,\r\ncable towage has been introduced in addition to the older methods of\r\ntransporting merchandise by sailing and steam boats or by towage with\r\nscrew or paddle tugs. A chain or wire rope is laid on the bottom of the\r\nriver bed, fixed to anchors at the ends and passed over a chain pulley\r\ndriven by the steam engine and guided by pulleys on the steam tug, the tug\r\nlifting it out of the water at the bow and dropping it over the stern and\r\nwinding itself with the barges attached to it along the chain, the latter\r\nbeing utilized as a rule only for the up journey, while down the river the\r\ntugs are propelled by paddles or screws, and can tow a sufficient number\r\nof barges with the assistance of the current. The system has been found\r\nadvantageous, as, although the power required for drawing the barges and\r\ntugs against the current is of course the same in all cases, the slip and\r\nwaste of power by screws and paddles is avoided. The size of the screws or\r\npaddles is also limited by the nature of the river and its traffic, and\r\nwith cable towage a larger number of barges can be hauled, while the\r\nprogress made is definite and there is no drifting back, as occurs with\r\npaddle or screw tugs when they have temporarily to slow or stop their\r\nengines on account of passing vessels. Several streams, as the Elbe,\r\nRhine, and Rhone, have now such cables laid for long distances in those\r\nparts of the rivers where the traffic is sufficient to warrant the\r\nadoption of the system. While this has been introduced only during the\r\nlast 16 or 18 years, a similar method of transporting merchandise has been\r\nin use in Russia on the river Volga for upward of 40 years. Navigation on\r\nthis river is interrupted for about half the year by the ice, and the\r\ntraffic is of larger amount only during part of the summer, while the\r\nlength of the river itself is very great, so that laying down permanent\r\ncables would not pay; while, on the other hand, the current is so strong\r\nthat towage of some sort must be resorted to for the transport of large\r\nquantities. The problem has been solved by the introduction of the capstan\r\nnavigation or towage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPSTAN NAVIGATION ON THE VOLGA.]\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of capstans in use, one actuated by horse-power and\r\nthe other by steam engines. A horse capstan boat carries according to size\r\n150 to 200 horses, which are stabled in the hold. On deck a number of\r\nhorse gears are arranged at which the horses work. The power of the\r\nseparate gears is transmitted to a main shaft, which is connected to the\r\ndrums that wind on the rope. The horses work under an awning to protect\r\nthem from the burning sunshine, and are changed every three hours. Eight\r\nand sometimes ten horses work at each horse gear. The horses are changed\r\nwithout interruption of the work, the gears being disengaged from the main\r\nshaft in rotation and the horses taken out and put in while the gear is\r\nstanding. The horses are bought at the place of departure in the south of\r\nRussia and resold at the destination, usually Nishny-Novgorod, at a fair\r\nprofit, the capstan boat carrying fodder and provender for the attendants.\r\nThe capstan is accompanied by a steam launch which carries the anchor and\r\nhawser forward in advance of the capstan. The latter has a diameter of as\r\nmuch as 5 in., and is two to three miles in length. The anchor is dropped\r\nby the tug and the hawser carried back to the capstan, where it is\r\nattached to one of the rope drums, and the boat with the barges attached\r\nto it towed along by the horse gears described above winding on the\r\nhawser. The advance continues without interruption day and night, the\r\nlaunch taking a second anchor and hawser forward and dropping the anchor\r\nin advance of the first by a hawser's length, so that when the capstan has\r\nwound up the first hawser it finds a second one ready for attachment to\r\nthe rope drum. The launch receives the first hawser, picks up the anchor,\r\nand passes the capstan to drop it again in advance of the anchor\r\npreviously placed, and carries the hawser back to the capstan, and so on.\r\nA capstan tows twelve or more barges, placed in twos or threes beside and\r\nclose behind each other, with a load of a million pounds, or about 16,000\r\nto 17,000 tons. From Astrachan and the mouth of the Kama the capstans make\r\nduring the season from the beginning of May to the end of July in the most\r\nfavorable case two journeys to the fair of Nishny-Novgorod; after this\r\ntime no more journeys are made, as the freights are wanting. At the end of\r\nthe up-stream journey the horses are sold, as mentioned before, and the\r\ncapstan towed down stream by the steam launch to Astrachan or the Kama\r\nmouth, where meanwhile a fresh lot of barges has been loaded and got\r\nready, a new supply of horses is bought, and the operation repeated.\r\n\r\nBesides these horse capstans there are steam capstans which are less\r\ncomplicated and have condensing steam engines of about 100 horse power,\r\nthe power being transmitted by gearing to the rope drum. The rope drum\r\nshaft projects on both sides beyond the boards of the boat, and for the\r\nreturn journey paddle wheels, are put on to assist the launch in towing\r\nthe clumsy and big capstan boat down the river. The steam capstans tow\r\nconsiderably larger masses of goods than the horse capstans and also\r\ntravel somewhat quicker, so that the launch has scarcely sufficient time\r\nto drop and raise the anchors and also to make double the journey. We do\r\nnot doubt that this system of towage might with suitable modifications be\r\nadvantageously employed on the large rivers in America and elsewhere for\r\nthe slow transport of large quantities of raw materials and other bulky\r\nmerchandise, a low speed being, as is well known, much more economical\r\nthan a high speed, as many of the resistances increase as the square and\r\neven higher powers of the velocity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAMBOAT EQUIPMENT OF WAR VESSELS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe larger ships in the navy, and some of the more recent small ones, such\r\nas the new cruisers of the Phaeton class, are fitted with powerful steam\r\nwinches of a type made by Messrs. Belliss and Co. These are used for\r\nlifting the pinnaces and torpedo boats.\r\n\r\nWe give an illustration of one of these winches. The cylinders are 6 in.\r\nin diameter and 10 in. stroke. The barrel is grooved for wire rope, and is\r\nsafe to raise the second class steel torpedo boats, weighing nearly 12\r\ntons as lifted. The worm gearing is very carefully cut, so that the work\r\ncan be done quietly and safely. With machinery of this kind a boat is soon\r\nput into the water, and as an arrangement is fitted for filling the boat's\r\nboilers with hot water from the ship's boilers, the small craft can be\r\nunder way in a very short time from the order being given.\r\n\r\nMr. White is fitting compound engines with outside condensers to boats as\r\nsmall as 21 ft. long, and we give a view of a pair of compound engines of\r\na new design, which Messrs. Belliss are making for the boats of this\r\nclass. The cylinders are 4 in. and 7 in. in diameter by 5 in. stroke. The\r\ngeneral arrangement is well shown in the engraving. On a trial recently\r\nmade, a 25 ft. cutter with this type of engines reached a speed of 7.4\r\nknots.\r\n\r\nAbout three years ago the late Controller of the Navy, Admiral Sir W.\r\nHouston Stewart, wished to ascertain the relative consumption of fuel in\r\nvarious classes of small vessels. An order was accordingly sent to\r\nPortsmouth, and a series of trials were made. From the official reports of\r\nthese we extract the information contained in tables F and G, and we think\r\nthe details cannot fail to be of interest to our readers. The run around\r\nthe island was made in company with other boats, without stopping, and\r\nobservations were taken every half hour. The power given out by the\r\nengines was fairly constant throughout. The distance covered was 56 knots,\r\nand the total amount of fuel consumed, including that required for raising\r\nsteam, was 1,218 lb. of coal and 84 lb. of wood. The time taken in raising\r\nsteam to 60 lb. pressure was forty-three minutes. The rate of consumption\r\nof fuel is of course not the lowest that could be obtained, as a speed of\r\nover 10 knots is higher than that at which the machinery could be worked\r\nmost economically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STEAM WINCH FOR HOISTING AND LOWERING PINNACLES AND\r\nTORPEDO BOATS.]\r\n\r\nThe trials afterward made to find the best results that could be obtained\r\nin fuel consumption were rather spoiled by the roughness of the weather on\r\nthe day they were made. The same boat was run for 10 miles around the\r\nmeasured mile buoys in Stokes Bay.

Farron, Ashton-under-Lyne. The general appearance of this\r\narrangement is as in Fig. 1 or Fig. 3, the center view, Fig. 2, showing\r\nwhat is the cardinal feature of the trap, viz., that it contains a\r\ncollector for silt, sand, or sediment which is not, as in most other\r\ntraps, carried out through the valve with the efflux of water. The escape\r\nvalve also is made very large, so that while the trap may be made short,\r\nor, in other words, the expansion pipe may not be long, a tolerably large\r\narea of outlet is obtained with the short lift due to the small movement\r\nof the expansion pipe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED STEAM TRAP.]\r\n\r\nThe object of a steam trap is for the removal of water of condensation\r\nwithout allowing the escape of steam from drying apparatus and steam pipes\r\nused for heating, power, or other purposes. One of the plans employed is\r\nby an expansion pipe having a valve fixed to its end, so that when the\r\npipe shortens from being cooler, due to the presence of the water, the\r\nvalve opens and allows the escape of the water until the steam comes to\r\nthe trap, which, being hotter, lengthens the pipe and closes the valve.\r\nNow with this kind of trap, and, in fact, with any variety of trap, we\r\nunderstand that it has been frequently the experience of the user to find\r\nhis contrivance inoperative because the silt or sand that may be present\r\nin the pipes has been carried to the valve and lodged there by the water,\r\ncausing it to stick, and with expansion traps not to close properly or to\r\nwork abnormally some way or other. The putting of these contrivances to\r\nrights involves a certain amount of trouble, which is completely obviated\r\nby the arrangement shown in the annexed engravings, which is certainly a\r\nsimple, strong, and substantial article. The foot of the trap is made of\r\ncast iron, the seat of the valve being of gun metal, let into the\r\ndiaphragm, cast inside the hollow cylinder. The valve, D, is also of gun\r\nmetal, and passing to outside through a stuffing box is connected to the\r\ncentral expansion pipe by a nut at E. The valve is set by two brass nuts\r\nat the top, so as to be just tight when steam hot; if, then, from the\r\npresence of water the trap is cooled, the pipe contracts and the water\r\nescapes. A mud door is provided, by which the mud can be removed as\r\nrequired. The silt or dirt that may be in the pipes is carried to the trap\r\nby the water, and is deposited in the cavity, as shown, the water rises,\r\nand when the valve, D, opens escapes at the pipe, F, and may be allowed to\r\nrun to waste. A pipe is not shown attached to F, but needless to say one\r\nmay be connected and led anywhere, provided the steam pressure is\r\nsufficient. For this purpose the stuffing-box is provided; it is really\r\nnot required if the water runs to waste, as is represented in the\r\nengraving. To give our readers some idea of the dimensions of the valve,\r\nwe may say that the smallest size of trap has 1 in. expansion pipe and a\r\nvalve 3 in. diameter, the next size 1¼ in. expansion pipe and a valve 4½\r\nin. diameter, and the largest size has a pipe 1½ in. and a valve 6 in.\r\ndiameter. Altogether, the contrivance has some important practical\r\nadvantages to recommend it.--_Mech.

BRASHEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our study of the exact methods of measurement in use to-day, in the\r\nvarious branches of scientific investigation, we should not forget that it\r\nhas been a plant of very slow growth, and it is interesting indeed to\r\nglance along the pathway of the past to see how step by step our micron of\r\nto-day has been evolved from the cubit, the hand's breadth, the span, and,\r\nif you please, the barleycorn of our schoolboy days. It would also be a\r\npleasant task to investigate the properties of the gnomon of the Chinese,\r\nEgyptians, and Peruvians, the scarphie of Eratosthenes, the astrolabe of\r\nHipparchus, the parallactic rules of Ptolemy, Regimontanus Purbach, and\r\nWalther, the sextants and quadrants of Tycho Brahe, and the modifications\r\nof these various instruments, the invention and use of which, from century\r\nto century, bringing us at last to the telescopic age, or the days of\r\nLippershay, Jannsen, and Galileo.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIt would also be a most pleasant task to follow the evolution of our\r\nsubject in the new era of investigation ushered in by the invention of\r\nthat marvelous instrument, the telescope, followed closely by the work of\r\nKepler, Scheiner, Cassini, Huyghens, Newton, Digges, Nonius, Vernier,\r\nHall, Dollond, Herschel, Short, Bird, Ramsden, Troughton, Smeaton,\r\nFraunhofer, and a host of others, each of whom has contributed a noble\r\nshare in the elimination of sources of error, until to-day we are\r\nsatisfied only with units of measurement of the most exact and refined\r\nnature. Although it would be pleasant to review the work of these past\r\nmasters, it is beyond the scope of the present paper, and even now I can\r\nonly hope to call your attention to one phase of this important subject.\r\nFor a number of years I have been practically interested in the subject of\r\nthe production of plane and curved surfaces particularly for optical\r\npurposes, _i.e._, in the production of such surfaces free if possible from\r\nall traces of error, and it will be pleasant to me if I shall be able to\r\nadd to the interest of this association by giving you some of my own\r\npractical experience; and may I trust that it will be an incentive to all\r\nengaged in kindred work _to do that work well?_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nIn the production of a perfectly plane surface, there are many\r\ndifficulties to contend with, and it will not be possible in the limits of\r\nthis paper to discuss the methods of eliminating errors when found; but I\r\nmust content myself with giving a description of various methods of\r\ndetecting existing errors in the surfaces that are being worked, whether,\r\nfor instance, it be an error of concavity, convexity, periodic or local\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3]\r\n\r\nA very excellent method was devised by the celebrated Rosse, which is\r\nfrequently used at the present time; and those eminent workers, the Clarks\r\nof Cambridge, use a modification of the Rosse method which in their hands\r\nis productive of the very highest results. The device is very simple,\r\nconsisting of a telescope (_a_, Fig. 1) in which aberrations have been\r\nwell corrected, so that the focal plane of the objective is as sharp as\r\npossible. This telescope is first directed to a distant object, preferably\r\na celestial one, and focused for parallel rays. The surface, _b_, to be\r\ntested is now placed so that the reflected image of the same object,\r\nwhatever it may be, can be observed by the same telescope. It is evident\r\nthat if the surface be a true plane, its action upon the beam of light\r\nthat comes from the object will be simply to change its direction, but not\r\ndisturb or change it any other way, hence the reflected image of the\r\nobject should be seen by the telescope, _a_, without in any way changing\r\nthe original focus. If, however, the supposed plane surface proves to be\r\n_convex_, the image will not be sharply defined in the telescope until the\r\neyepiece is moved _away_ from the object glass; while if the converse is\r\nthe case, and the supposed plane is concave, the eyepiece must now be\r\nmoved _toward_ the objective in order to obtain a sharp image, and the\r\namount of convexity or concavity may be known by the change in the focal\r\nplane. If the surface has periodic or irregular errors, no sharp image can\r\nbe obtained, no matter how much the eyepiece may be moved in or out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4]\r\n\r\nThis test may be made still more delicate by using the observing\r\ntelescope, _a_, at as low an angle as possible, thereby bringing out with\r\nstill greater effect any error that may exist in the surface under\r\nexamination, and is the plan generally used by Alvan Clark & Sons. Another\r\nand very excellent method is that illustrated in Fig. 2, in which a second\r\ntelescope, _b_, is introduced. In place of the eyepiece of this second\r\ntelescope, a diaphragm is introduced in which a number of small holes are\r\ndrilled, as in Fig. 2, _x_, or a slit is cut similar to the slit used in a\r\nspectroscope as shown at _y_, same figure. The telescope, _a_, is now\r\nfocused very accurately on a celestial or other very distant object, and\r\nthe focus marked. The object glass of the telescope, _b_, is now placed\r\nagainst and \"square\" with the object glass of telescope _a_, and on\r\nlooking through telescope a an image of the diaphragm with its holes or\r\nthe slit is seen. This diaphragm must now be moved until a sharp image is\r\nseen in telescope _a_. The two telescopes are now mounted as in Fig. 2,\r\nand the plate to be tested placed in front of the two telescopes as at\r\n_c_. It is evident, as in the former case, that if the surface is a true\r\nplane, the reflected image of the holes or slit thrown upon it by the\r\ntelescope, _b_, will be seen sharply defined in the telescope, _a_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nIf any error of convexity exists in the plate, the focal plane is\r\ndisturbed, and the eyepiece must be moved _out_. If the plate is concave,\r\nit must be moved _in_ to obtain a sharp image. Irregular errors in the\r\nplate or surface will produce a blurred or indistinct image, and, as in\r\nthe first instance, no amount of focusing will help matters. These methods\r\nare both good, but are not satisfactory in the highest degree, and two or\r\nthree important factors bar the way to the very best results. One is that\r\nthe aberrations of the telescopes must be perfectly corrected, a very\r\ndifficult matter of itself, and requiring the highest skill of the\r\noptician. Another, the fact that the human eye will accommodate itself to\r\nsmall distances when setting the focus of the observing telescope. I have\r\nfrequently made experiments to find out how much this accommodation was in\r\nmy own case, and found it to amount to as much as 1/40 of an inch. This is\r\nno doubt partly the fault of the telescopes themselves, but unless the eye\r\nis rigorously educated in this work, it is apt to accommodate itself to a\r\nsmall amount, and will invariably do so if there is a preconceived notion\r\nor bias _in the direction of the accommodation_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\nTalking with Prof. C.A. Young a few months since on this subject, he\r\nremarked that he noticed that the eye grew more exact in its demands as it\r\ngrew older, in regard to the focal point. A third and very serious\r\nobjection to the second method is caused by diffraction from the edges of\r\nthe holes or the slit. Let me explain this briefly. When light falls upon\r\na slit, such as we have here, it is turned out of its course; as the slit\r\nhas two edges, and the light that falls on either side is deflected both\r\nright and left, the rays that cross from the right side of the slit toward\r\nthe left, and from the left side of the slit toward the right, produce\r\ninterference of the wave lengths, and when perfect interference occurs,\r\ndark lines are seen. You can have a very pretty illustration of this by\r\ncutting a fine slit in a card and holding it several inches from the eye,\r\nwhen the dark lines caused by a total extinction of the light by\r\ninterference may be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\nIf now you look toward the edge of a gas or lamp flame; you will see a\r\nseries of colored bands, that bring out the phenomenon of partial\r\ninterference. This experiment shows the difficulty in obtaining a perfect\r\nfocus of the holes or the slit in the diaphragm, as the interference\r\nfringes are always more or less annoying. Notwithstanding these defects of\r\nthe two systems I have mentioned, in the hands of the practical workman\r\nthey are productive of very good results, and very many excellent surfaces\r\nhave been made by their use, and we are not justified in ignoring them,\r\nbecause they are the stepping stones to lead us on to better ones. In my\r\nearly work Dr. Draper suggested a very excellent plan for testing a flat\r\nsurface, which I briefly describe. It is a well known truth that, if an\r\nartificial star is placed in the exact center of curvature of a truly\r\nspherical mirror, and an eyepiece be used to examine the image close\r\nbeside the source of light, the star will be sharply defined, and will\r\nbear very high magnification. If the eyepiece is now drawn toward the\r\nobserver, the star disk begins to expand; and if the mirror be a truly\r\nspherical one, the expanded disk will be equally illuminated, except the\r\nouter edge, which usually shows two or more light and dark rings, due to\r\ndiffraction, as already explained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nNow if we push the eyepiece toward the mirror the same distance on the\r\nopposite side of the true focal plane, precisely the same appearance will\r\nbe noted in the expanded star disk. If we now place our plane surface any\r\nwhere in the path of the rays from the great mirror, we should have\r\nidentically the same phenomena repeated. Of course it is presumed, and is\r\nnecessary, that the plane mirror shall be much less in area than the\r\nspherical mirror, else the beam of light from the artificial star will be\r\nshut off, yet I may here say that any one part of a truly spherical mirror\r\nwill act just as well as the whole surface, there being of course a loss\r\nof light according to the area of the mirror shut off.\r\n\r\nThis principle is illustrated in Fig. 3, where _a_ is the spherical\r\nmirror, _b_ the source of light, _c_ the eyepiece as used when the plane\r\nis not interposed, _d_ the plane introduced into the path at an angle of\r\n45° to the central beam, and _e_ the position of eyepiece when used the\r\nwith the plane. When the plane is not in the way, the converging beam goes\r\nback to the eyepiece, _c_. When the plane, _d_, is introduced, the beam is\r\nturned at a right angle, and if it is a perfect surface, not only does the\r\nfocal plane remain exactly of the same length, but the expanded star\r\ndisks, are similar on either side of the focal plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nI might go on to elaborate this method, to show how it may be made still\r\nmore exact, but as it will come under the discussion of spherical\r\nsurfaces, I will leave it for the present. Unfortunately for this process,\r\nit demands a large truly spherical surface, which is just as difficult of\r\nattainment as any form of regular surface. We come now to an instrument\r\nthat does not depend upon optical means for detecting errors of surface,\r\nnamely, the spherometer, which as the name would indicate means sphere\r\nmeasure, but it is about as well adapted for plane as it is for spherical\r\nwork, and Prof. Harkness has been, using one for some time past in\r\ndetermining the errors of the plane mirrors used in the transit of Venus\r\nphotographic instruments. At the meeting of the American Association of\r\nScience in Philadelphia, there was quite a discussion as to the relative\r\nmerits of the spherometer test and another form which I shall\r\npresently mention, Prof. Harkness claiming that he could, by the\r\nuse of the spherometer, detect errors bordering closely on one\r\nfive-hundred-thousandth of an inch. Some physicists express doubt on this,\r\nbut Prof. Harkness has no doubt worked with very sensitive instruments,\r\nand over very small areas at one time.\r\n\r\nI have not had occasion to use this instrument in my own work, as a more\r\nsimple, delicate, and efficient method was at my command, but for one\r\nmeasurement of convex surfaces I know of nothing that can take its place.\r\nI will briefly describe the method of using it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe usual form of the instrument is shown in Fig. 4; _a_ is a steel screw\r\nworking in the nut of the stout tripod frame, _b_; _c c c_ are three legs\r\nwith carefully prepared points; _d_ is a divided standard to read the\r\nwhole number of revolutions of the screw, _a_, the edge of which also\r\nserves the purpose of a pointer to read off the division on the top of the\r\nmilled head, _e_. Still further refinement may be had by placing a vernier\r\nhere. To measure a plane or curved surface with this instrument, a perfect\r\nplane or perfect spherical surface of known radius must be used to\r\ndetermine the zero point of the division. Taking for granted that we have\r\nthis standard plate, the spherometer is placed upon it, and the readings\r\nof the divided head and indicator, _d_, noted when the point of the screw,\r\n_a_, just touches the surface, _f_. Herein, however, lies the great\r\ndifficulty in using this instrument, _i.e._, to know the exact instant of\r\ncontact of the point of screw, _a_, on the surface, _f_. Many devices have\r\nbeen added to the spherometer to make it as sensitive as possible, such as\r\nthe contact level, the electric contact, and the compound lever contact.\r\nThe latter is probably the best, and is made essentially as in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nI am indebted for this plan to Dr. Alfred Mayer. As in the previous\r\nfigure, _a_ is the screw; this screw is bored out, and a central steel pin\r\nturned to fit resting on a shoulder at _c_. The end of _d_ projects below\r\nthe screw, _a_, and the end, _e_, projects above the milled head, and the\r\nknife edge or pivot point rests against the lever, _f_, which in turn\r\nrests against the long lever, _g_, the point, _h_, of which moves along\r\nthe division at _j_. It is evident that if the point of the pin just\r\ntouches the plate, no movement of the index lever, _g_, will be seen; but\r\nif any pressure be applied, the lever will move through a multiplied arc,\r\nowing to the short fulcri of the two levers. Notwithstanding all these\r\nprecautions, we must also take into account the flexure of the material,\r\nthe elasticity of the points of contact, and other idiosyncrasies, and you\r\ncan readily see that practice alone in an instrument so delicate will\r\nbring about the very best results. Dr. Alfred Mayer's method of getting\r\nover the great difficulty of knowing when all four points are in contact\r\nis quite simple. The standard plate is set on the box, _g_, Fig. 4, which\r\nacts as a resonater. The screw, _a_, is brought down until it touches the\r\nplate. When the pressure of the screw is enough to lift off either or all\r\nof the legs, and the plate is gently tapped with the finger, a _rattle_ is\r\nheard, which is the tell-tale of imperfect contact of all the points. The\r\nscrew is now reversed gently and slowly until the _moment_ the rattle\r\nceases, and then the reading is taken. Here the sense of hearing is\r\nbrought into play. This is also the case when the electric contact is\r\nused. This is so arranged that the instant of touching of the point of\r\nscrew, _a_, completes the electric circuit, in which an electromagnet of\r\nshort thick wire is placed. At the moment of contact, or perhaps a little\r\nbefore contact, the bell rings, and the turning of the screw must be\r\ninstantly stopped. Here are several elements that must be remembered.\r\nFirst, it takes time to set the bell ringing, time for the sound to pass\r\nto the ear, time for the sensation to be carried to the brain, time for\r\nthe brain to send word to the hand to cease turning the screw, and, if you\r\nplease, it takes time for the hand to stop. You may say, of what use are\r\nsuch refinements? I may reply, what use is there in trying to do anything\r\nthe very best it can be done? If our investigation of nature's profound\r\nmysteries can be partially solved with good instrumental means, what is\r\nthe result if we have better ones placed in our hands, and what, we ask,\r\nif the _best_ are given to the physicist? We have only to compare the\r\ntelescope of Galileo, the prism of Newton, the pile of Volta, and what was\r\ndone with them, to the marvelous work of the telescope, spectroscope, and\r\ndynamo of to-day. But I must proceed. It will be recognized that in\r\nworking with the spherometer, only the points in actual contact can be\r\nmeasured at one time, for you may see by Fig. 6 that the four points, _a a\r\na a_, may all be normal to a true plane, and yet errors of depression, as\r\nat _e_, or elevation, as at _b_, exist between them, so that the\r\ninstrument must be used over every available part of the surface if it is\r\nto be tested rigorously. As to how exact this method is I cannot say from\r\nactual experience, as in my work I have had recourse to other methods that\r\nI shall describe. I have already quoted you the words of Prof. Harkness.\r\nDr. Hastings, whose practical as well as theoretical knowledge is of the\r\nmost critical character, tells me that he considers it quite easy to\r\nmeasure to 1/80000 of an inch with the ordinary form of instrument. Here\r\nis a very fine spherometer that Dr. Hastings works with from time to time,\r\nand which he calls his standard spherometer. It is delicately made, its\r\nscrew being 50 to the inch, or more exactly 0.01998 inch, or within\r\n2/100000 of being 1/50 of an inch pitch. The principal screw has a point\r\nwhich is itself an independent screw, that was put in to investigate the\r\nerrors of the main screw, but it was found that the error of this screw\r\nwas not as much as the 0.00001 of an inch. The head is divided into two\r\nhundred parts, and by estimation can be read to 1/100000 of an inch. Its\r\nconstants are known, and it may be understood that it would not do to\r\nhandle it very roughly. I could dwell here longer on this fascinating\r\nsubject, but must haste. I may add that if this spherometer is placed on a\r\nplate of glass and exact contact obtained, and then removed, and the hand\r\nheld over the plate without touching it, the difference in the temperature\r\nof the glass and that of the hand would be sufficient to distort the\r\nsurface enough to be readily recognized by the spherometer when replaced.\r\nAny one desiring to investigate this subject further will find it fully\r\ndiscussed in that splendid series of papers by Dr. Alfred Mayer on the\r\nminute measurements of modern science published in SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\nSUPPLEMENTS, to which I was indebted years ago for most valuable\r\ninformation, as well as to most encouraging words from Prof. Thurston,\r\nwhom you all so well and favorably know. I now invite your attention to\r\nthe method for testing the flat surfaces on which Prof. Rowland rules the\r\nbeautiful diffraction gratings now so well known over the scientific\r\nworld, as also other plane surfaces for heliostats, etc., etc. I am now\r\napproaching the border land of what may be called the abstruse in science,\r\nin which I humbly acknowledge it would take a vast volume to contain all I\r\ndon't know; yet I hope to make plain to you this most beautiful and\r\naccurate method, and for fear I may forget to give due credit, I will say\r\nthat I am indebted to Dr. Hastings for it, with whom it was an original\r\ndiscovery, though he told me he afterward found it had been in use by\r\nSteinheil, the celebrated optician of Munich. The principle was discovered\r\nby the immortal Newton, and it shows how much can be made of the ordinary\r\nphenomena seen in our every-day life when placed in the hands of the\r\ninvestigator. We have all seen the beautiful play of colors on the soap\r\nbubble, or when the drop of oil spreads over the surface of the water.\r\nPlace a lens of long curvature on a piece of plane polished glass, and,\r\nlooking at it obliquely, a black central spot is seen with rings of\r\nvarious width and color surrounding it. If the lens is a true curve, and\r\nthe glass beneath it a true plane, these rings of color will be perfectly\r\nconcentric and arranged in regular decreasing intervals. This apparatus is\r\nknown as Newton's color glass, because he not only measured the phenomena,\r\nbut established the laws of the appearances presented. I will now endeavor\r\nto explain the general principle by which this phenomenon is utilized in\r\nthe testing of plane surfaces. Suppose that we place on the lower plate,\r\nlenses of constantly increasing curvature until that curvature becomes\r\nnil, or in other words a true plane. The rings of color will constantly\r\nincrease in width as the curvature of the lens increases, until at last\r\none color alone is seen over the whole surface, provided, however, the\r\nsame angle of observation be maintained, and provided further that the\r\nfilm of air between the glasses is of absolutely the same relative\r\nthickness throughout. I say the film of air, for I presume that it would\r\nbe utterly impossible to exclude particles of dust so that absolute\r\ncontact could take place. Early physicists maintained that absolute\r\nmolecular contact was impossible, and that the central separation of the\r\nglasses in Newton's experiment was 1/250,000 of an inch, but Sir Wm.\r\nThomson has shown that the separation is caused by shreds or particles of\r\ndust. However, if this separation is equal throughout, we have the\r\nphenomena as described; but if the dust particles are thicker under one\r\nside than the other, our phenomena will change to broad parallel bands as\r\nin Fig. 8, the broader the bands the nearer the absolute parallelism of\r\nthe plates. In Fig. 7 let _a_ and _b_ represent the two plates we are\r\ntesting. Rays of white light, _c_, falling upon the upper surface of plate\r\n_a_, are partially reflected off in the direction of rays _d_, but as\r\nthese rays do not concern us now, I have not sketched them. Part of the\r\nlight passes on through the upper plate, where it is bent out of its\r\ncourse somewhat, and, falling upon the _lower_ surface of the upper plate,\r\nsome of this light is again reflected toward the eye at _d_. As some of\r\nthe light passes through the upper plate, and, passing through the film of\r\nair between the plates, falling on the upper surface of the _lower_ one,\r\nthis in turn is reflected; but as the light that falls on this surface has\r\nhad to traverse the film of air _twice_, it is retarded by a certain\r\nnumber of half or whole wave-lengths, and the beautiful phenomena of\r\ninterference take place, some of the colors of white light being\r\nobliterated, while others come to the eye. When the position of the eye\r\nchanges, the color is seen to change. I have not time to dwell further on\r\nthis part of my subject, which is discussed in most advanced works on\r\nphysics, and especially well described in Dr. Eugene Lommel's work on \"The\r\nNature of Light.\" I remarked that if the two surfaces were perfectly\r\n_plane_, there would be one color seen, or else colors of the first or\r\nsecond order would arrange themselves in broad parallel bands, but this\r\nwould also take place in plates of slight curvature, for the requirement\r\nis, as I said, a film of air of equal thickness throughout. You can see at\r\nonce that this condition could be obtained in a perfect convex surface\r\nfitting a perfect concave of the same radius. Fortunately we have a check\r\nto guard against this error. To produce a perfect plane, _three surfaces\r\nmust_ be worked together, unless we have a true plane to commence with;\r\nbut to make this true plane by this method we _must_ work three together,\r\nand if each one comes up to the demands of this most rigorous test, we may\r\nrest assured that we have attained a degree of accuracy almost beyond\r\nhuman conception. Let me illustrate. Suppose we have plates 1, 2, and 3,\r\nFig. 11. Suppose 1 and 2 to be accurately convex and 3 accurately concave,\r\nof the same radius. Now it is evident that 3 will exactly fit 1 and 2, and\r\nthat 1 and 2 will separately fit No. 3, _but_ when 1 and 2 are placed\r\ntogether, they will only touch in the center, and there is no possible\r\nway to make three plates coincide when they are alternately tested upon\r\none another than to make _perfect planes_ out of them. As it is difficult\r\nto see the colors well on metal surfaces, a one-colored light is used,\r\nsuch as the sodium flame, which gives to the eye in our test, dark and\r\nbright bands instead of colored ones. When these plates are worked and\r\ntested upon one another until they all present the same appearance, one\r\nmay be reserved for a test plate for future use. Here is a small test\r\nplate made by the celebrated Steinheil, and here two made by myself, and I\r\nmay be pardoned in saying that I was much gratified to find the\r\ncoincidence so nearly perfect that the limiting error is much less than\r\n0.00001 of an inch. My assistant, with but a few months' experience, has\r\nmade quite as accurate plates. It is necessary of course to have a glass\r\nplate to test the metal plates, as the upper plate _must_ be transparent.\r\nSo far we have been dealing with perfect surfaces. Let us now see what\r\nshall occur in surfaces that are not plane. Suppose we now have our\r\nperfect test plate, and it is laid on a plate that has a compound error,\r\nsay depressed at center and edge and high between these points. If this\r\nerror is regular, the central bands arrange themselves as in Fig. 9. You\r\nmay now ask, how are we to know what sort of surface we have? A ready\r\nsolution is at hand. The bands _always travel in the direction of the\r\nthickest film of air_, hence on lowering the eye, if the convex edge of\r\nthe bands travel in the direction of the arrow, we are absolutely certain\r\nthat that part of the surface being tested is convex, while if, as in the\r\ncentral part of the bands, the concave edges advance, we know that part is\r\nhollow or too low. Furthermore, any small error will be rigorously\r\ndetected, with astonishing clearness, and one of the grandest qualities of\r\nthis test is the absence of \"personal equation;\" for, given a perfect test\r\nplate, _it won't lie_, neither will it exaggerate. I say, won't lie, but I\r\nmust guard this by saying that the plates must coincide absolutely in\r\ntemperature, and the touch of the finger, the heat of the hand, or any\r\ndisturbance whatever will vitiate the results of this lovely process; but\r\nmore of that at a future time. If our surface is plane to within a short\r\ndistance of the edge, and is there overcorrected, or convex, the test\r\nshows it, as in Fig. 10. If the whole surface is regularly convex, then\r\nconcentric rings of a breadth determined by the approach to a perfect\r\nplane are seen. If concave, a similar phenomenon is exhibited, except in\r\nthe case of the convex, the broader rings are near the center, while in\r\nthe concave they are nearer the edge. In lowering the eye while observing\r\nthe plates, the rings of the convex plate will advance outward, those of\r\nthe concave inward. It may be asked by the mechanician, Can this method be\r\nused for testing our surface plates? I answer that I have found the\r\nscraped surface of iron bright enough to test by sodium light. My\r\nassistant in the machine work scraped three 8 inch plates that were tested\r\nby this method and found to be very excellent, though it must be evident\r\nthat a single cut of the scraper would change the spot over which it\r\npassed so much as to entirely change the appearance there, but I found I\r\ncould use the test to get the general outline of the surface under process\r\nof correction. These iron plates, I would say, are simply used for\r\npreliminary formation of polishers. I may have something to say on the\r\nquestion of surface plates in the future, as I have made some interesting\r\nstudies on the subject. I must now bring this paper to a close, although I\r\nhad intended including some interesting studies of curved surfaces. There\r\nis, however, matter enough in that subject of itself, especially when we\r\nconnect it with the idiosyncrasies of the material we have to deal with, a\r\nvital part of the subject that I have not touched upon in the present\r\npaper. You may now inquire, How critical is this \"color test\"? To answer\r\nthis I fear I shall trench upon forbidden grounds, but I call to my help\r\nthe words of one of our best American physicists, and I quote from a\r\nletter in which he says by combined calculation and experiment I have\r\nfound the limiting error for white light to be 1/50000000 of an inch, and\r\nfor Na or sodium light about fifty times greater, or less than 1/800000 of\r\nan inch. Dr. Alfred Mayer estimated and demonstrated by actual experiment\r\nthat the smallest black spot on a white ground visible to the naked eye is\r\nabout 1/800 of an inch at the distance of normal vision, namely, 10\r\ninches, and that a line, which of course has the element of extension,\r\n1/5000 of an inch in thickness could be seen. In our delicate \"color test\"\r\nwe may decrease the diameter of our black spot a thousand times and still\r\nits perception is possible by the aid of our monochromatic light, and we\r\nmay diminish our line ten thousand times, yet find it just perceivable on\r\nthe border land of our test by white light. Do not presume I am so foolish\r\nas to even think that the human hand, directed by the human brain, can\r\never work the material at his command to such a high standard of\r\nexactness. No; from the very nature of the material we have to work with,\r\nwe are forbidden even to hope for such an achievement; and could it be\r\npossible that, through some stroke of good fortune, we could attain this\r\nhigh ideal, it would be but for a moment, as from the very nature of our\r\nenvironment it would be but an ignis fatuus. There is, however, to the\r\nearnest mind a delight in having a high model of excellence, for as our\r\nmodel is so will our work approximate; and although we may go on\r\napproximating _our_ ideal forever, we can never hope to reach that which\r\nhas been set for us by the great Master Workman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[JOURNAL OF GAS LIGHTING.]\r\n\r\nPHOTOMETRICAL STANDARDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn carrying out a series of photometrical experiments lately, I found that\r\nit was a matter of considerable difficulty to keep the flames of the\r\nstandard candles always at their proper distance from the light to be\r\nmeasured, because the wick was continually changing its position (of\r\ncourse carrying the flame with it), and thus practically lengthening or\r\nshortening the scale of the photometer, according as the flame was carried\r\nnearer to or farther from the light at the other end of the scale. In\r\norder, therefore, to obtain a correct idea of the extent to which this\r\nvariation of the position of the wick might influence the readings of the\r\nphotometer scale, I took a continuous number of photographs of the flame\r\nof a candle while it was burning in a room quite free from draught; no\r\nother person being in it during the experiment except a photographer, who\r\nplaced sensitive dry plates in a firmly fixed camera, and changed them\r\nafter an exposure of 30 seconds. In doing this he was careful to keep\r\nclose to the camera, and disturb the air of the room as little as\r\npossible. In front of the candle a plumb-line was suspended, and remained\r\nimmovable over its center during the whole operation. The candle was\r\nallowed to get itself into a normal state of burning, and then the wick\r\nwas aligned, as shown in the photographs Nos. 1 and 2, after which it was\r\nleft to itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VARIATION IN PHOTOMETRICAL STANDARDS.]\r\n\r\nWith these photographs (represented in the cuts) I beg to hand you\r\nfull-sized drawings of the scales of a 100 inch Evans and a 60 inch\r\nLetheby photometer, in order to give your readers an opportunity of\r\nestimating for themselves the effect which such variations from the true\r\ndistance between the standard light and that to be measured, as shown in\r\nthis series of photographs, must exercise on photometrical observations\r\nmade by the aid of either of the instruments named.\r\n\r\nW.

LAUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe operation of moulding presents numerous advantages over other methods\r\nof shaping porcelain, for by this process we avoid irregularities of form,\r\ntwisting, and visible seams, and can manufacture thin pieces, as well as\r\npieces of large dimensions, of a purity of form that it is impossible to\r\nobtain otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe method of moulding small objects has been described with sufficient\r\ndetail in technical works, but such is not the case with regard to large\r\nones, and for this reason it will be of interest to quote some practical\r\nobservations from a note that has been sent me by Mr. Constantine Renard,\r\nwho, for several years, has had the superintendence of the moulding rooms\r\nof the Sevres works.\r\n\r\nThe process of moulding consists in pouring porcelain paste, thinned with\r\nwater, into very dry plaster moulds. This mixture gradually hardens\r\nagainst the porous sides with which it is in contact, and, when the\r\nthickness of the hardened layer is judged sufficient, the mould is emptied\r\nby inverting it. The excess of the liquid paste is thus eliminated, while\r\nthe thicker parts remain adherent to the plaster. Shortly afterward, the\r\nabsorption of the water continuing, the paste so shrinks in drying as to\r\nallow the object to detach itself from the mould. As may be seen, nothing\r\nis simpler when it concerns pieces of small dimensions; but the same is\r\nnot the case when we have to mould a large one. In this case we cannot get\r\nrid of the liquid paste by turning the mould upside down, because of the\r\nlatter's size, and, on another hand, it is necessary to take special\r\nprecautions against the subsidence of the paste. Recourse is therefore had\r\nto another method. In the first place, an aperture is formed in the lower\r\npart of the mould through which the liquid may flow at the desired moment.\r\nAfterward, in order to prevent the solidified but still slightly soft\r\npaste from settling under its own weight at this moment, it is supported\r\nby directing a current of compressed air into the mould, or, through\r\natmospheric pressure, by forming a vacuum in the metallic jacket in which\r\nthe mould is inclosed.\r\n\r\nThe history and description of these processes have been several times\r\ngiven, and I shall therefore not dwell upon them, but shall at once\r\nproceed to make known the new points that Mr. Renard has communicated to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe first point to which it is well to direct the manufacturer's attention\r\nis the preparation of the plaster moulds. When it concerns an object of\r\nlarge dimensions, of a vase a yard in height, for example, the moulder is\r\nobliged to cut the form or core horizontally into three parts, each of\r\nwhich is moulded separately. To this effect, it is placed upon a core\r\nframe and surrounded with a cylinder of sheet zinc. The workman pours the\r\nplaster into the space between the latter and the core, and, while doing\r\nso, must stir the mass very rapidly with a stick, so that at the moment\r\nthe plaster sets, it shall be as homogeneous as possible. In spite of such\r\nprecautions, it is impossible to prevent the densest parts of the plaster\r\nfrom depositing first, through the action of gravity. These will naturally\r\nprecipitate upon the table or upon the slanting sides of the core, and the\r\nmould will therefore present great inequalities as regards porosity. Since\r\nthis defect exists in each of the pieces that have been prepared in\r\nsuccession, it will be seen that when they come to be superposed for the\r\nmoulding of the piece, the mould as a whole will be formed of zones of\r\ndifferent porosities, which will absorb water from the paste unequally.\r\nFarther along we shall see the inconveniences that result from this, and\r\nthe manner of avoiding them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nThe mould, when finished, is dried in a stove. Under such circumstances it\r\noften happens that there forms upon the surface of the plaster a hard\r\ncrust which, although it is of no importance as regards the outside of the\r\nmould, is prejudicial to the interior because it considerably diminishes\r\nits absorbing power. This trouble may be avoided by coating the surfaces\r\nthat it is necessary to preserve with clear liquid paste; but Mr. Renard\r\nadvises that the mould be closed hermetically, so that the interior shall\r\nbe kept from contact with warm air. In this way it is possible to prevent\r\nthe plaster from hardening, as a result of too quick a desiccation. I now\r\ncome to the operation of moulding. In the very first place, it is\r\nnecessary to examine whether it is well to adopt the arrangement by\r\npressure of air or by vacuum. The form of the objects will determine the\r\nchoice. A very open piece, like a bowl, must be moulded by vacuum, on\r\naccount of the difficulty of holding the closing disk in place if it be of\r\nvery large dimensions. The same is the case with large vases of wood form.\r\nOn the contrary, an elongated piece tapering from above is more easily\r\nmoulded by pressure of the air, as are also ovoid vessels 16 to 20 inches\r\nin height. In any case it must not be forgotten that the operation by\r\nvacuum should be preferred every time the form of the objects is adapted\r\nto it, because this process permits of following and directing the drying,\r\nwhile with pressure it is impossible to see anything when once the\r\napparatus is closed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\n_Moulding by Pressure of the Air._--The plaster mould having been put in\r\nplace upon the mould board, and the liquid paste having been long and\r\nthoroughly stirred in order to make it homogeneous, and get rid of the air\r\nbubbles, we open the cock that puts the paste reservoir in communication\r\nwith the lower part of the mould, care having been taken beforehand to\r\npour a few pints of water into the bottom of the mould. The paste in\r\nascending pushes this water ahead of it, and this slightly wets the\r\nplaster and makes the paste rise regularly. When the mould is entirely\r\nfilled, the paste is still allowed to flow until it slightly exceeds the\r\nupper level, and, spreading out over the entire thickness of the plaster,\r\nforms a sort of thick flange. The absorption of the liquid begins almost\r\nimmediately, and, consequently, the level lowers. A new quantity of paste\r\nis introduced, and we continue thus, in regulating its flow so as to keep\r\nthe mould always full. This operation is prolonged until the layer is\r\njudged to be sufficiently thick, this depending upon the dimensions, form,\r\nor construction of the vessel. The operation may take from one to five\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe desired thickness having been obtained, it becomes a question of\r\nallowing the paste to descend and at the same time to support the piece by\r\nair pressure. The flange spoken of above is quickly cut, and the paste is\r\nmade to rise again for the last time, in order to form a new flange, but\r\none that this time will be extremely thin; then a perforated disk designed\r\nfor forming the top joint, and acting as a conduit for the air, is placed\r\nupon the mould. This disk is fastened down with a screw press, and when\r\nthe apparatus is thus arranged the eduction cock is opened, and the air\r\npump maneuvered.\r\n\r\nIf the flange did not exist, the air would enter between the mould and the\r\npiece at the first strokes of the piston, and the piece would be\r\ninevitably broken. Its object, then, is to form a hermetical joint,\r\nalthough it must at the same time present but a slight resistance, since,\r\nas soon as the liquid paste has flowed out, the piece begins to shrink,\r\nand it is necessary that at the first movement downward it shall be able\r\nto disengage itself, since it would otherwise crack.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the piece begins to detach itself from the mould the air enters\r\nthe apparatus, and the pressure gauge connected with the air pump begins\r\nto lower. It is then necessary, without a moment's loss of time, to remove\r\nthe screw press, the disk, and the upper part of the mould itself, in\r\norder to facilitate as much as possible the contraction of the piece.\r\nFinally, an hour or an hour and a half later, it is necessary to remove\r\nthe lower part of the mould, this being done in supporting the entire\r\naffair by the middle. The piece and what remains of the mould are, in\r\nreality, suspended in the air. All these preparations are designed to\r\nprevent cracking.\r\n\r\n_Moulding by Vacuum._--The operation by vacuum follows the same phases as\r\nthose just described. It is well, in order to have a very even surface,\r\nnot to form a vacuum until about three hours after the paste has been made\r\nto ascend. Without such a precaution the imperfections in the mould will\r\nbe shown on the surface of the object by undulations that are\r\nirremediable.\r\n\r\nThe first flange or vein must be preserved, and it is cut off at the\r\nmoment the piece is detached.\r\n\r\nMoulding by vacuum, aside from the advantages noted above, permits of\r\ngiving the pieces a greater thickness than is obtained in the pressure\r\nprocess. According to Mr. Renard, when it is desired to exceed one inch at\r\nthe base of the piece (the maximum thickness usually obtained), the\r\noperation is as follows: The piece is moulded normally, and it is\r\nsupported by a vacuum; but, at the moment at which, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, it would be detached, the paste is made to ascend a second\r\ntime, when the first layer (already thick and dry) acts as a sort of\r\nsupplementary mould, and permits of increasing the thickness by about 2/5\r\nof an inch. The piece is held, as at first, by vacuum, and the paste is\r\nintroduced again until the desired thickness is obtained.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the care taken, accidents are frequent in both processes. They\r\nare due, in general, to the irregular contraction of the pieces, caused by\r\na want of homogeneousness in the plaster of the moulds. In fact, as the\r\nabsorption of the water does not proceed regularly over the entire surface\r\nof the piece, zones of dry paste are found in contact with others that are\r\nstill soft, and hence the formation of folds, and finally the cracking and\r\nbreaking of the piece. The joints of the moulds are also a cause of\r\nfrequent loss, on account of the marks that they leave, and that injure\r\nthe beauty of the form as well as the purity of the profile.\r\n\r\nMr. Renard has devised a remedy for all such inconveniences. He takes\r\nunglazed muslin, cuts it into strips, and, before beginning operations,\r\nfixes it with a little liquid paste to the interior of the mould. This\r\nlight fabric in no wise prevents the absorption of the water, and so the\r\noperation goes on as usual; but, at the moment of contraction, the piece\r\nof porcelain being, so to speak, supported by the muslin, comes put of the\r\nmould more easily and with extreme regularity. Under such circumstances\r\nall trace of the joint disappears, the imperfections in the mould are\r\nunattended with danger, and the largest pieces are moulded with entire\r\nsafety. In a word, we have here a very important improvement in the\r\nprocess of moulding. The use of muslin is to be recommended, not only in\r\nthe manufacture of vases, but also in the difficult preparation of large\r\nporcelain plates. It is likewise advantageous in the moulding of certain\r\npieces of sculpture that are not very delicate, and, finally, it is very\r\nuseful when we have to do with a damaged mould, which, instead of being\r\nrepaired with plaster, can be fixed with well ground wet sand covered with\r\na strip of muslin.\r\n\r\n_Drying of the Moulded Pieces._--When the moulded pieces become of a\r\nproper consistency in the mould, they are exposed to the air and then\r\ntaken to the drying room. But, as with plaster, the surface of the paste\r\ndries very quickly, and this inconvenience (which amounts to nothing in\r\npieces that are to be polished) is very great in pieces that carry\r\nornaments in relief, since the finishing of these is much more difficult,\r\nthe hardened paste works badly, and frequently flakes off. In order to\r\nremedy this inconvenience, it suffices to dust the places to be preserved\r\nwith powdered dry paste.--_Revue Industrielle._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOTO-TRICYCLE APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHOTO-TRICYCLE APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThis consists of a portable folding camera, with screw focusing\r\narrangement, swing back, and an adapter frame placed in the position of\r\nthe focus screen, allowing the dark slide to be inserted so as to give the\r\nhorizontal or vertical position to the dry plate when in the camera.

Morize, of Rio de Janeiro. The instrument is used to\r\nmeasure the actinic power of sunlight when the sun is at various\r\naltitudes; but the same principle is applicable to other light sources.\r\nThe sensitive part of the apparatus consists of a cylinder formed of 38\r\ndisks of copper, isolated from each other by as many disks of mica. The\r\nlatter being of smaller diameter than the copper disks, the annular spaces\r\nbetween the two are filled with selenium, by the simple process of rubbing\r\na stick of this substance over the edges, and afterward gently warming.\r\nThe selenium then presents a grayish appearance, and is ready for use.\r\nConnection is made by conductors, on opposite sides, with the odd and even\r\nnumbers of the disks, which diminishes the resistance of the selenium. The\r\ncylinder thus formed is insulated by glass supports in the inside of a\r\nvacuum tube, for the purpose of preserving it from the disturbing\r\ninfluence of dark rays. The whole is placed upon a stand, and shielded\r\nfrom reflected light, but fully exposed to that which is to be measured\r\nfor actinic intensity. If now a constant current of electricity is passed\r\nthrough the apparatus, as indicated by a galvanometer, the variations of\r\nthe latter will show the effect produced upon the selenium. A scale must\r\nbe prepared, with the zero point at the greatest possible resistance of\r\nthe selenium, which corresponds with absolute darkness. The greatest\r\neffect of the light would be to annul the resistance of the selenium.\r\nConsequently, the cylinder must be withdrawn from the circuit to represent\r\nthis effect; and the maximum deviation of the galvanometer is then to be\r\nobserved, and marked 100. By dividing the range of the galvanometer thus\r\nobtained into 100 equal parts, the requisite actinometric scale will be\r\nestablished. In practice, the Clamond battery is used to supply the\r\nconstant current required.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASTRONOMICAL PHOTOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years, or rather decades of years, it has become\r\nrather a trite saying that to advance far in any branch of physical\r\nresearch a fair proficiency in no inconsiderable number of the sister\r\nsciences is an absolute necessity. But if this is true in general, none, I\r\nthink, will question the assertion that a proficient in any of the\r\nphysical sciences must be fairly conversant with photography as a science,\r\nor at least as an art. If we take for example a science which has of late\r\nyears made rapid strides both in Europe and America, the science of\r\nastronomy, we shall not have far to go to find convincing proof that a\r\ngreat portion of the best work that is being done by its votaries is\r\neffected by the aid of photography. One eminent astronomer has quite\r\nlately gone so far as to declare that we no longer require observers of\r\nthe heavens, but that their place can be better supplied by the gelatine\r\nplate of the photographer; and his words have been echoed by others not\r\nless able than himself. \"Abolish the observer, and substitute the\r\nsensitive plate,\" is a sensational form of expressing the revolution in\r\nobservational astronomy that is taking place under our eyes; but, although\r\nit suggests a vast amount of truth, it might leave upon the mind an\r\nexaggerated impression inimical to the best interests of science.\r\n\r\nThe award of the highest distinction in astronomy, the gold medal of the\r\nRoyal Astronomical Society, two years in succession, to those who have\r\nbeen most successful in celestial photography is no doubtful sign of the\r\ngreat value attached to such work. Last year it was Mr. Common who\r\nreceived the highest testimony of the merit due to his splendid\r\nphotographs of the nebula of Orion; and this year Dr. Huggins, who has\r\ndrawn much attention to celestial photography, by his successful attempts\r\nto picture the solar corona in full daylight, has received a similar\r\nacknowledgment of his labors in photographing the spectra of stars and\r\ncomets and nebulæ.\r\n\r\nAn adequate idea of the progress astronomy is now making by aid of\r\nphotography can only be formed by a comprehensive view of all that is\r\nbeing at present attempted; but a rapid glance at some of the work may\r\nprepare the way for a more thorough investigation. A few years since, the\r\nastronomers who had advanced their science by aid of photography were few\r\nin number, and their results are soon enumerated. Some good pictures of\r\nthe solar corona taken during solar eclipses, a series or two of sun-spot\r\nphotographs, and a very limited number of successful attempts made upon\r\nthe moon, and planets, and star clusters, were all the fruits of their\r\nlabors. But now each month we learn of some new and efficient laborer in\r\nthis field, which gives promise of so rich a harvest.\r\n\r\nEach day the sun is photographed at Greenwich, at South Kensington, in\r\nIndia, and at the Physical Observatory of Potsdam, and thus a sure record\r\nis obtained of all the spots upon its surface, which may serve for the\r\nstudy of the periodicity of its changes, and for their probable connection\r\nwith the important phenomena of terrestrial magnetism and meteorology. In\r\nFrance the splendid sun-pictures obtained by Dr. Janssen at the Physical\r\nObservatory of Meudon have thrown into the shade all other attempts at a\r\nphotographic study of the most delicate features of the solar surface.\r\n\r\nDr. Huggins has shown that it is possible to obtain a daily photographic\r\nrecord of the solar prominences, and only lately he has secured results\r\nthat justified a special expedition to the Alps to photograph the sun's\r\ncorona, and he has now moved the Admiralty to grant a subsidy to Dr. Gill,\r\nthe government astronomer at the Cape, by aid of which Mr. Woods can carry\r\non the experiments that were so encouraging last summer in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nWe may, then, reasonably hope to obtain before long a daily picture of the\r\nsun and a photographic record of its prominences, and even of a certain\r\nportion of the solar corona; but the precious moments of each solar\r\neclipse will always be invaluable for picturing those wondrous details in\r\nthe corona that are now shown us by photography, and which can be obtained\r\nby photography alone.\r\n\r\nAgain, how very much is to be learnt in solar physics from the marvelous\r\nphotographs of the sun's spectrum exhibited last summer by Professor\r\nRowland; photographs that show as many as one hundred and fifty lines\r\nbetween H and K, and which he is still laboring to improve! The extension,\r\ntoo, of the visible solar spectrum into the ultra-violet by Corun,\r\nMascart, and others, adds much to our knowledge of the sun; while the\r\nphotographs of Abney in the ultrared increase our information in a\r\ndirection less expected and certainly less easy of attainment. Both these\r\nextensions we find most ably utilized in the recent discussion of the very\r\ninteresting photographs of the spectra of the prominences and of the\r\ncorona taken during the total eclipse of May 18, 1882; and the\r\nphotographic results of this eclipse afford ample proof that we can not\r\nonly obtain pictures of the corona by photography that it would be\r\nimpossible otherwise to procure, but also that in a few seconds\r\ninformation concerning the nature of the solar atmosphere may be furnished\r\nby photography that it would otherwise take centuries to accumulate, even\r\nunder the most favorable circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be gained by accurate photographs of the moon and\r\nplanets, that will permit great enlargements, are too obvious to call for\r\nlengthened notice in such a rapid sketch as the present; for it is\r\nprincipally in the observation of details that the eye cannot grasp with\r\nthe required delicacy, or with sufficient rapidity, that photography is so\r\nessential for rapid and sure progress.\r\n\r\nLike the sketches of a solar eclipse, the drawings that are made of\r\ncomets, and still more of nebulæ, even by the most accomplished artists,\r\nare all, to say the least, open to doubt in their delicate details. And\r\nthe truth of this is so obvious, that it is the expressed opinion of an\r\nable astronomer that a single photograph of the nebula of Orion, taken by\r\nMr. Common, would be of more value to posterity than the collective\r\ndrawings of this interesting object so carefully made by Rosse, Bond,\r\nSecchi, and so many others.\r\n\r\nAnother most important branch of astronomy, that is receiving very great\r\nattention at present, is the mapping of the starry heavens; and herein\r\nphotography will perhaps do its best work for the astronomer. The trial\r\nstar map by the brothers Henry, of a portion of the Milky Way, which they\r\nfelt unable to observe satisfactorily by the ordinary methods, is so near\r\nabsolute perfection that it alone proves the immense superiority of the\r\nphotographic method in the formation of star maps. Fortunately this\r\nsubject, which is as vast as it is fundamental, is being taken up\r\nvigorously. The Henries are producing a special lens for the work; Mr.\r\nGrubb is constructing a special Cassgrain reflector for Mr. Roberts of\r\nMaghull; and the Admiralty have instructed Mr. Woods to make this part of\r\nhis work at the Cape Observatory, under the able direction of Dr. Gill.\r\nBesides star maps, clusters, too, and special portions of the heavens are\r\nbeing photographed by the Rev. T.E. Espin, of West Kirby; and such\r\npictures will be of the greatest value, not only in fixing the position at\r\na given date, but also aiding in the determination of magnitude, color,\r\nvariability, proper motion, and even of the orbits of double and multiple\r\nstars, and the possible discovery of new planets and telescopic comets.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the many branches of astronomy that are receiving the\r\nmost valuable aid at present from photography; but the very value of the\r\ngift that is bestowed should make exaggeration an impossibility.\r\nPhotography can well afford to be generous, but it must first be just, in\r\nits estimate of the work that has still to be done in astronomy\r\nindependently of its aid; and although the older science points with just\r\npride to what is being done for her by her younger sister, still she must\r\nnot forget that now, as in the future, she must depend largely for her\r\nprogress, not only on the skill of the photographer and the mathematician,\r\nbut also on the trained eye and ear and hand of her own indefatigable\r\nobservers.--_S.J.

Jeannolle before the Paris Academy of Sciences, in which the author\r\ndescribed a new method for keeping boilers clean. This method is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nThe inside of a steam boiler is placed, by means of piles of a certain\r\npower, in reciprocal communication, the current passing at one end through\r\npositive, and at the other through negative, wires. In incrusted steam\r\nboilers, at a temperature ranging from 212° to 300° Fahr., and a pressure\r\nof from 30 to 90 lb. to the square inch, the current thus engendered\r\ndecomposes the accumulated salts, and precipitates them, from which they\r\nmay easily be removed, either by means of a special siphon or by means of\r\nsome other mechanical process. When boilers are free from fur, and where\r\nit is intended to keep them free from such, a continuous current may be\r\nset up, by means of which the sedimentary salts may be decomposed, and a\r\nprecipitate produced in a pulverized form, which can be removed with equal\r\nfacility.\r\n\r\nFrom a series of minute experiments made by M. Jeannolle, it appears that\r\nin order to render the various actions of electricity, perfect, it is\r\nnecessary to coat either with red lead or with pulverized iron, or with\r\nany other conductor of electricity, an operation which must be repeated\r\nwhenever the boiler is emptied with a view to cleaning out. The above\r\nsystem Is being advantageously applied in Calais for removing the\r\nincrustations of boilers. The two poles of a battery of ten to twelve\r\nBunsen elements are applied to the ends of the boilers, and after thirty\r\nto forty hours the deposits fall from the sides to the bottom. When a\r\nboiler has been thus cleared, the formation of new deposits may be\r\nprevented by applying a much less energetic current under the same\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHABET DESIGNED BY GODFREY SYKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUGGESTIONS IN DECORATIVE ART.--ALPHABET DESIGNED BY\r\nGODFREY SYKES.]\r\n\r\nAmong the many designs which have been issued by the South Kensington\r\nMuseum authorities is the alphabet which we have illustrated here to-day.\r\nThe letters appear frequently among the decorations of the museum\r\nbuildings, especially in the refreshment rooms and the Ceramic gallery,\r\nwhere long inscriptions in glazed terra cotta form ornamental friezes.

Societies_.]\r\n\r\nBy E.W. BOWDITCH, C.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am unable to tell you what is generally considered the best practice,\r\nfor I am not sure there are any definitely established rules; therefore I\r\ncan only explain _my_ ways of doing such work, which, though I try to make\r\nas complete and at the same time as simple as possible, I know to be far\r\nfrom perfect.\r\n\r\nPlumbing and drainage work has grown up unconsciously with my landscape\r\ngardening, and not finding any texts or practice that seemed wholly\r\nsatisfactory, I have been forced to devise new arrangements from time to\r\ntime, according to the requirements of the case in hand.\r\n\r\nTo give all the details of house plumbing this evening, or any _one_\r\nevening, would be impossible, for lack of time, and not worth while even\r\nif there was time, as much of it would prove matter of little or no\r\ninterest. I will confine my remarks, therefore, to certain elements of the\r\nwork where my practice differs, I believe, essentially from that of most\r\nengineers, and where perhaps my experience, if of no assistance to other\r\nmembers of the Society, may excite their friendly criticism in such a way\r\nas to help me.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of country places that I am liable to be called upon\r\nto prescribe for:\r\n\r\n_First._ A new place where nothing has been arranged.\r\n\r\n_Second._ An old place where the occupants have been troubled either by\r\ntheir outside arrangements or by fixtures or pipes within.\r\n\r\nUnder the first head let us suppose a small tract of perhaps two acres of\r\nland in some inland town, where the family intends to live but six months\r\nin the year, though they are liable to reside there the whole twelve.\r\n\r\nThere are no sewers and no public water. The soil is a stiff, retentive\r\nclay, rather wet in spring. The desire is expressed to have plumbing and\r\ndrainage that shall be as inexpensive as possible, but that shall be\r\nentirely safe.\r\n\r\nIn considering the arrangements inside the house, I find myself in the\r\nsame predicament as the French surgeon, a specialist upon setting the\r\nbones of the arm, who, when a patient was brought him with his right arm\r\nbroke, expressed his sorrow at being unable to be of assistance, as his\r\nspecialty was the left arm.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to post myself thoroughly upon house plumbing, but\r\nconfess to only knowing partially about the wastes; the supplies I do not\r\nfeel competent to pass upon.\r\n\r\nOne class of annoyance caused by plumbing, perhaps the principal one, is\r\ndue to the soil pipe or some of its fittings.\r\n\r\nSecond quality of iron, poor hanging, insufficient calking, careless\r\nmechanics, putty, cement, rag, or paper joints--all these and a dozen\r\nother things are liable to be sources of trouble. Subordinate wastes are\r\napt to be annoying, occasionally, too, to a less extent.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical work can always be superintended, and within certain limits\r\nmay be made secure and tight; not so easy, however, with the materials.\r\n\r\nThere is seldom a valid excuse for ever making waste pipes, within a\r\nbuilding, of anything but metal.\r\n\r\nEarthen tile is frequently used; also, to a limited extent, brick, stone,\r\nand wood; twice I have found canvas--all these, however, are inferior, and\r\nshould never be accepted or specified. The writer believes that at the\r\npresent time, hereabouts, lead and iron are more used for wastes than any\r\nother materials, and are found the most satisfactory on the whole.\r\n\r\nOne or two arrangements, relative to the wastes, I have made use of that\r\nare not, so far as known, in general use, and that may not be the best,\r\nthough they have served me many good turns, and I have not succeeded in\r\ndevising any better.\r\n\r\nSoil pipe, as it is usually put in, is apt to be of cast iron, four inches\r\nin diameter, and is known in the market as \"heavy\" or \"extra heavy.\" For\r\nsome years the tar-coated or black enameled pipe has been the favorite, as\r\nbeing the more reliable, the writer in common with others making use of\r\nthe same freely, until one day a cracked elbow, tar coated, was detected.\r\nSince that time plain, untarred pipe has been specified, and subjected to\r\nthe so-called kerosene test, which consists of swabbing out each pipe with\r\nkerosene or oil and then allowing it to stand for a few hours. A moment's\r\nthought will convince any one that when a pipe is asphalted or tar coated\r\nit is very difficult to detect either sand holes or small cracks, and the\r\ndifficulty of proper calking is increased, as lead does not cling so well\r\nto the tar as to plain iron.\r\n\r\nAt present, the kerosene test, so far as the writer is concerned, is a\r\nmisnomer, because raw linseed oil is used exclusively as giving more\r\nsatisfactory results, and being less troublesome to apply.\r\n\r\nI have here a length of the ordinary \"heavy 4\" commercial soil pipe,\r\nplain, and selected at random. Yesterday noon I had it oiled at my office,\r\nin order to be ready for to-night, and you see, by the chalk marks I have\r\nmade, just where the leaks were and their area. I may say here that a\r\nsound pipe of this caliber and standard weight is the exception rather\r\nthan the rule, and it was selected for this experiment merely to try and\r\nshow the reaction a little better than the heavier pipe might.\r\n\r\nExperiments of this nature I have carried along for the past two years,\r\nand I am glad to say that, since I began, the quality of the soil pipe\r\nfurnished by the dealers for my work seems appreciably better than at\r\nfirst. Whether the poorer pipe is still made and sold to other customers I\r\nhave no means of knowing; probably it is, however.\r\n\r\nA large quantity of the pipe is now being tested at my suggestion by the\r\nSuperintendent of Construction of the Johns Hopkins Hospital, at\r\nBaltimore. I have not yet heard the results from him, but doubtless they\r\nwill be interesting. A brief summary of the results may be of some\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nThe different makers of soil pipe generally used by plumbers hereabouts\r\nare:\r\n\r\nMott & Company, Abendroth, Blakslee, Dighton, Phillips & Weeden, and\r\nBartlett, Hayward & Co.\r\n\r\nOn 4\" extra heavy pipe my results have been as follows:\r\n\r\nPercentage passed as good, single hub.  60 per ct. to 70 per ct.\r\nPercentage passed as good, double.      20 per ct. to 80 per ct.\r\nPercentage passed special castings,\r\n   including Y's and T's.               60 per ct.\r\n\r\n5\" pipe extra heavy:\r\n\r\nPercentage passed as good, single hub.  25 per ct. to 35 per ct.\r\nPercentage passed as good, double.      No record.\r\nPercentage special castings,\r\nincluding Y's and T's.                  60 per ct.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated to me by dealers that the tar coating does away with\r\nthe necessity of any such test as the oil; while I am not prepared to\r\nacknowledge or deny the statement, it is well known that much poor pipe is\r\ntar-coated and sold in the market as good, and when coated it is almost\r\nimpossible to detect any but _very_ defective work.\r\n\r\nThe price customers are obliged to pay for soil pipe, either \"heavy\" or\r\n\"extra heavy,\" is very high indeed, even taking off the discounts, and\r\namounts (as I figure it) to $70 per long ton for 4\" pipe. The present rate\r\nfor the best water pipe of the same caliber is about $38 (now $29) per\r\nlong ton, and the additional charge for soil pipe should guarantee the\r\nvery best iron in the market, though it appears to be rarely furnished.\r\n\r\nIt is asserted that all soil pipe is tested to a 50-pound water pressure.\r\nI beg leave to question the absolute truth of this, unless it be\r\nacknowledged that pipe is sold indiscriminately, whether it bears the test\r\nor not, for more than once I have found a single length of soil pipe (5\r\nfeet) that could not bear the pressure of a column of water of its own\r\nheight without leaking.\r\n\r\nHaving obtained a satisfactory lot of soil pipe and fittings, the next\r\ntrouble comes with the lead calking. Unfortunately, it is frequently found\r\nthat very shallow joints are made instead of deep ones, and hard lead used\r\ninstead of soft. My rule is, soft lead, two runnings and two calkings. By\r\nsoft lead I mean pig lead, and by hard lead I mean old pipe and scrap lead\r\nthat may have been melted a dozen times. Incidentally it may be remarked\r\nthat it is quite difficult to calk a tight joint on the heavy pipe; the\r\nprocess will crack the hub.\r\n\r\nThe fixtures used in a house are of minor importance--there are dozens of\r\ngood patterns of every class. If they are carefully put in, and provided\r\nwith suitable traps placed just as close to the fixture as possible, the\r\nresult will usually be satisfactory.\r\n\r\nVery few instances occur where traps are placed as close to the fixtures\r\nthey serve as they might be, and yet a very short length of untrapped\r\npipe, when fouled, will sometimes smell dreadfully. A set bowl with trap\r\ntwo feet away may become in time a great nuisance if not properly used. A\r\ncase in point where the fixture was used both as a bowl and a urinal was\r\nin a few months exceedingly offensive--a fact largely (though not wholly)\r\ndue to its double service.\r\n\r\nI have never met two sanitarians who agreed upon the same water-closets,\r\nbowls, faucets, traps, etc.\r\n\r\nOf course, the soil pipe will be carried, of full size, through the roof,\r\nand sufficiently high to clear all windows.\r\n\r\nAvoid multiplicity of fixtures or pipes; cut off all fixtures not used at\r\nleast twice a week, lest their traps dry out; have all plumbing as simple\r\nas possible, and try and get it all located so that outside air can be got\r\ndirectly into all closets and bath-rooms. As far as possible, set your\r\nfixtures in glass rather than tiles or wood. Carry the lower end of the\r\nmain drain at least five feet beyond the cellar walls of the building, of\r\ncast iron.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at the outside work. The main drain (carrying everything\r\nexcept the kitchen and pantry sinks) goes through a ventilated running\r\ntrap. An indirect fresh air inlet is provided on the house side of the\r\ntrap (example), to prevent annoyance from puffing or pumping, or, better\r\nstill, a pipe corresponding to the soil pipe is carried up on the outside\r\nof the house.\r\n\r\nThe running trap ventilator should be of the same diameter as the main\r\ndrain (4 inch), and serve as a main drain vent also. Carry this pipe on\r\nthe outside of the house as high as the top of the chimney.\r\n\r\nA grease-trap should be provided for the kitchen and pantry sinks.\r\nFormerly my custom was to put in brick receptacles; it is now to put in\r\nPortland cement traps (Henderson pattern), though perhaps I may succeed in\r\ndevising a cast-iron one that will answer better. The brick ones were\r\noccasionally heaved by the frost, and cracked; the Portland cement ones\r\nanswer better, and when thoroughly painted with red lead do not soak an\r\nappreciable quantity of sewage to be offensive, but are too high priced\r\n($28 each). I have made one or two patterns for cast-iron ones, but none\r\nas yet that I feel satisfied with.\r\n\r\nBeyond the running trap an Akron pipe should convey the sewage to a tank\r\nor cesspool.\r\n\r\nOur supposable case is the second most difficult to take care of. The\r\nworst would be ledge. We have to contend with, however, hard, wet,\r\nimpervious clay.\r\n\r\nThe best way undoubtedly is to underdrain the land, and then to distribute\r\nthe sewage on the principle of intermittent downward filtration. This is\r\nrather expensive, and a customer is rarely willing to pay the bills for\r\nthe same. I should always advise it as the best; but where not allowed to\r\ndo so, I have had fair success with shallow French drains connecting with\r\nthe tank or cesspool.\r\n\r\nSiphon tanks, such as are advised by many sanitarians, that were used\r\nfirst in this country, I believe, by Mr. Waring, I have not been very\r\nsuccessful with. Obstructions get into the siphon and stop it up, or it\r\ngets choked with grease. I prefer a tight tank, provided with a tell-tale,\r\nand that is to be opened either by a valve operated by hand, or that is\r\narranged with a standing overflow like a bath tub, and that can be raised\r\nand secured by a hook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANITARY COOKING.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Read before the Indiana State Sanitary Society, Seymour,\r\nMarch 13, 1884.--_The Sanitarian._]\r\n\r\nBy VIRGINIA L. OPPENHEIMER, M.D., Seymour, Ind.\r\n\r\n\r\n    \"We may live without poetry, music, and art,\r\n    We may live without conscience, and live without heart,\r\n    We may live without friends,\r\n    We may live without books,\r\n    But civilized man cannot live without cooks.\r\n\r\n    \"We may live without books--\r\n    What is knowledge but grieving?\r\n    We may live without hope--\r\n    What is hope but deceiving?\r\n    We may live without love--what is passion but pining?\r\n    But where is the man that can live without dining?\"\r\n\r\nThus saith the poet, and forthwith turns the world over into the hands of\r\nthe cook. And into what better hands could you fall? To you, my fat,\r\njolly, four-meals-a-day friend, Mr. Gourmand, but more especially to\r\n_you_, my somber, lean, dyspeptic, two-meals-a-day friend, Mr. Grumbler,\r\nthe cook is indeed a valuable friend. The cook wields a scepter that is\r\nonly second in power to that of love; and even love has become soured\r\nthrough the evil instrumentality of the good-looking or bad-cooking cook.\r\nThis is no jest, it is a very sad fact.\r\n\r\nNow, the question arises, how can the cook preserve the health of her\r\npatrons, maintain happiness in the family, and yet not throw the gourmands\r\ninto bankruptcy? Very simple, I assure you.\r\n\r\n1. You must have _the_ cook. I mean by this, that not every one can occupy\r\nthat important office. The greatest consideration in the qualities of a\r\ncook is, does she like the work? No one can fulfill the duties of any\r\nnoteworthy office unless he labors at them with vim and willingness.\r\n\r\n2. You must have good articles of food originally.\r\n\r\n3. As our honest Iago said, \"You must have change.\"\r\n\r\nWhen one arrives at adult age, he should have learned by experience what\r\narticles of food _do_, and what articles of food do _not_, agree with him,\r\nand to shun the latter, no matter how daintily served or how tempting the\r\ncircumstances. The man who knows that _pates de foie gras_, or the livers\r\nof abnormally fattened geese, disagree with him, and still eats them, is\r\nnot to be pitied when all the horrors of dyspepsia overtake him.\r\n\r\nThe cooking of any article of food has evidently much, very much, to do\r\nwith its digestibility. It is not the purpose of this paper to teach\r\ncooking, but merely to give some general hints as to the best as well as\r\nthe simplest methods of preparing staple articles of food. The same\r\narticles of food can and should be prepared differently on each day of the\r\nweek. Changes of diet are too likely to be underestimated. By constant\r\nchange the digestive organs in the average person are prevented from\r\nhaving that repulsion of food which, to a greater or less extent, is\r\nlikely to result from a sameness of diet continued for a long time.\r\n\r\nWe often hear from our scientific men that this or that article of food is\r\nexcellent for muscle, another for brain, another for bone, etc., etc. Now,\r\nstubborn facts are like stone walls, against which theories often butt out\r\ntheir beauty and their power. It is well known to almost every one\r\nnowadays that _well-cooked_ food, whether it be potatoes, meat and bread,\r\nfish, or anything else worthy the name of food, will well maintain,\r\nindefinitely, either the philosopher or the hodcarrier.\r\n\r\nMany of you know, and all of you ought to know, that the principal\r\ningredients of nearly all our foods are starch and albumen. Starch is the\r\nprincipal nutritive ingredient of vegetables and breadstuffs. Albumen is\r\nthe principal ingredient of meats, eggs, milk, and other animal\r\nderivatives.\r\n\r\nStarch never enters the system as starch, but must first be converted into\r\nsugar either in the body or out of it. The process of this transformation\r\nof starch into sugar is beautifully exemplified in certain plants, such as\r\nthe beet, the so-called sugar cane, and other growths. The young plant is,\r\nto a great extent, composed of starch; as the plant grows older, a\r\nsubstance is produced which is called _diastase_. Through the influence of\r\nthis _diastase_ the starch is converted into a peculiar non-crystallizable\r\nsubstance called _dextrine_, and as the plant matures, this dextrine is\r\ntransformed into crystallizable sugar.\r\n\r\n\"Dextrine is a substance that can be produced from starch by the action of\r\ndilute acids, alkalies, and malt extract, and by roasting it at a\r\ntemperature between 284° and 330° F., till it is of a light brown color,\r\nand has the odor of overbaked bread.\"\r\n\r\nA simple form of dextrine may be found in the brown crust of bread--that\r\nsweetish substance that gives the crust its agreeable flavor. Pure\r\ndextrine is an insipid, odorless, yellowish-white, translucent substance,\r\nwhich dissolves in water almost as readily as sugar. As stated above, it\r\nis easily converted into _dextrose_, or _glucose_, as it is usually named.\r\n\r\nThis _glucose_ is often sold under the name of sugar, and is the same\r\nagainst which so many of the newspapers waged such a war a year or two\r\nago. These critics were evidently, for the most part, persons who knew\r\nlittle about the subject. Glucose, if free from sulphuric acid or other\r\nchemicals, is as harmless as any other form of sugar. Most of our candies\r\ncontain more or less of it, and are in every way as satisfactory as when\r\nmanufactured wholly from other sugars.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, self-evident that, as sugar is a necessary article of\r\nfood, the process which aids the transformation of our starchy foods must\r\nnecessarily aid digestion. Do not understand me to say by this that, if\r\nall our starchy foods were converted into sugar, their digestion would\r\nthereby be completed. As I stated a moment ago, this sweet food, if taken\r\ninto the stomach day after day, would soon cause that particular organ to\r\nrebel against this sameness of diet. In order the more clearly to\r\nillustrate this point, I will briefly show you how some of the every-day\r\narticles of food can be each day differently prepared, and thus be\r\nrendered more palatable, and, as a consequence, more digestible; for it is\r\na demonstrated fact that savory foods are far more easily digested than\r\nthe same foods unsavored.\r\n\r\nThe art of serving and arranging dishes for the table is an accomplishment\r\nin itself. It is very reasonable that all things that go to make up beauty\r\nand harmony at the dinner table should add their full quota to the\r\nappetite, and, I was about to say, \"to the digestion;\" but will qualify\r\nthe statement by saying, to the digestion if the appetite be not porcine.\r\n\r\nOur commonest article of food is the _potato_. Let us see how\r\npotatoes--which contain only twenty per cent. of starch, as against\r\neighty-eight per cent. in rice, and sixty-six per cent. in wheat\r\nflour--can be prepared as just mentioned. We will look for a moment at the\r\nmanner in which they are usually served by the average cook:\r\n\r\n1, boiled with their jackets on; 2, roasted in the embers; 3, roasted with\r\nmeat; 4, fried; 5, mashed; 6, salad.\r\n\r\n1. Potatoes boiled in their jackets are excellent if properly prepared.\r\nBut there's the rub. The trouble is, they are too often allowed to boil\r\nslowly and too long, and thus become water-soaked, soggy, and solid, and\r\nproportionately indigestible. They should be put over a brisk fire, and\r\nkept at a brisk boil till done; then drain off the water, sprinkle a\r\nlittle salt over them, and return to the fire a moment to dry thoroughly,\r\nwhen you will find them bursting with their white, mealy contents.\r\n\r\n2. Roasted potatoes are general favorites, and very digestible. A more\r\nagreeable flavor is imparted to them if roasted in hot embers (wood fire),\r\ncare being used to keep them covered with the hot embers.\r\n\r\n3. Fried potatoes, as they are very generally served, are almost as\r\ndigestible as rocks, but not so tempting in all their grease-dripping\r\nbeauty as the latter. Many of you have doubtless seen the potatoes neatly\r\nsliced and dumped into a frying pan full of hot lard, where they were\r\npermitted to sink or float, and soak and sob for about a half hour or\r\nmore. When served, they presented the picturesque spectacle of miniature\r\npotato islands floating at liberty in a sea of yellow grease. Now, if any\r\nof you can relish and digest such a mess as that, I would advise you to\r\nleave this clime, and eat tallow candles with the Esquimaux.\r\n\r\nIf you are fond of fried potatoes, cook them in this way:\r\n\r\nTake what boiled potatoes are left from breakfast or dinner; when cold,\r\nremove the jackets, and cut into thin slices, season with salt, pepper,\r\nand a little Cayenne; have ready a hot frying pan, with enough meat\r\ndrippings or sweet lard to cover the bottom; put in the potatoes and fry a\r\nrich brown, stirring constantly with a knife to prevent burning. Serve\r\nvery hot.\r\n\r\n4. Mashed potatoes will be discussed further on.\r\n\r\n5. Potato salads are appetizing and piquant, because they are usually made\r\nup with strong condiments, onions, etc. They are, therefore, not very\r\ndigestible in themselves. Nevertheless, they are so palatable that we\r\ncannot easily dispense with them; but, after eating them, if you expect to\r\nhave inward peace, either split wood, walk eight and a half miles, or take\r\nsome other light exercise.\r\n\r\nMore palatable, and proportionately digestible, are the following methods\r\nof cooking this useful vegetable:\r\n\r\n1, Saratoga potatoes; 2, a la maitre d'hotel; 3, potato croquettes; 4,\r\npotatoes and cream; 5, a la Lyonnaise.\r\n\r\n1. For _Saratogas_, pare and slice your potatoes as thin as possible,\r\ndropping them into cold water in which is dissolved a tiny piece of alum\r\nto make them crisp. Let them remain in the water for an hour or longer.\r\nDrain, and wipe perfectly dry with a tea towel. Have ready a quantity of\r\nboiling lard. Drop them in, and fry a delicate brown. Drain all grease\r\nfrom them, sprinkle with salt, and serve. Here, in the crisp slices, you\r\nwill have the much desired dextrine. Or, in other words, your potato is\r\nalready half digested. Eat three or four potatoes prepared thus, and you\r\nfeel no inconvenience; but how would you feel did you devour three soggy,\r\nwater-soaked _boiled_ potatoes?\r\n\r\n2. For _a la maitre d'hotel_, pare the potatoes, cut into pieces half an\r\ninch wide, and the length of the potato; drop into cold water until wanted\r\n(an hour or so); then drain, and fry in boiling lard. Just as they begin\r\nto brown take them out with a skimmer; let them slightly cool; then put\r\nback, and fry a rich brown. This makes them puff up, and very attractive.\r\n\r\n3. For _croquettes_, take finely mashed potatoes, and mix with salt,\r\npepper, and butter, and sweet milk or cream enough to moisten thoroughly.\r\nMix with this one well-beaten egg, and form into small balls, taking care\r\nto have them smooth. Have ready one plate with a beaten egg upon it, and\r\nanother with cracker crumbs. Dip each ball into the egg, and then into the\r\ncrumbs, and brown nicely. Lay the croquettes on brown paper first, to get\r\nrid of any superfluous grease, then serve on a napkin.\r\n\r\n4. _Potatoes and cream_ are prepared by mincing cold boiled potatoes fine,\r\nputting them in a spider with a little melted butter in it, and letting\r\nthem fry slightly, keeping them well covered. Add a very small piece of\r\nfresh butter, season with pepper and salt, and pour over them cream or\r\nrich milk. Let them boil up once, and serve. This is a very nice dish, and\r\nmay be safely taken into delicate stomachs.\r\n\r\n5. _A la Lyonnaise_ is prepared as follows: Take five cold potatoes, one\r\nonion, butter, salt, and pepper. Slice the onion finely, and fry it in\r\nbutter until it begins to take color; add the sliced potatoes, salt and\r\npepper to taste, and keep shaking the saucepan until they are somewhat\r\nbrowned. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nA few random remarks about the preparation of albuminous foods. If the\r\nalbumen in food is hardened by prolonged cooking, it is rendered _less_\r\ninstead of more digestible. Therefore, the so-called _well-cooked_ meats\r\nare really _badly-cooked_ meats. Meats should be only half done, or rare.\r\nTo do this properly, it is necessary to cook with a quick fire. Steaks\r\nshould be broiled, not fried. I am in accord with a well-known orator, who\r\nsaid, recently, that \"the person who fries a steak should be arrested for\r\ncruelty to humanity.\" Some few meats should always be well cooked before\r\neating.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: These are the exceptions. Pork, on account of the prevalence\r\nof disease in hogs, should be well done.]\r\n\r\nThe same law holds good with eggs as with meats. A hard-boiled egg is only\r\nfit for the stomach of an ostrich; it was never intended by nature to\r\nadorn the human stomach. There are very many ways of preparing eggs--by\r\nfrying, baking, poaching, shirring, etc. I will only describe briefly a\r\nfew simple methods of making omelets.\r\n\r\nIn making this elegant dish, never use more than three eggs to an\r\n_omelet_. Plain omelet: Separate the whites and yolks; add a teaspoonful\r\nof water to the whites, and beat to a stiff froth; add to the yolks a\r\nteaspoonful of water, and beat until light; then season with salt, and\r\nabout two tablespoonfuls of cream or rich milk. Have your spider very hot;\r\nturn your whites and yolks together, and stir lightly to mix them; place a\r\nbit of butter in the spider, and immediately pour in your eggs. When set\r\n(which takes from ten to twenty seconds, and be careful that it does not\r\nbrown too much), fold together in a half moon, remove it, sprinkle with\r\npowdered sugar, and serve on a hot plate. It should be eaten immediately.\r\n\r\nFruit omelets are made by placing preserved fruits or jellies between the\r\nfolds. Baked omelets are prepared as above, with the addition of placing\r\nin the oven and allowing to brown slightly.\r\n\r\nFrench omelet is prepared in this way: Take a half cup of boiling milk\r\nwith a half teaspoonful of butter melted in it; pour this over one-half\r\ncup of bread crumbs (light bread); add salt, pepper, and the yolks of\r\nthree eggs beaten very light; mix thoroughly; and lastly, add the whites\r\nwhipped to a stiff froth. Stir lightly, and fry in butter. When nearly\r\ndone, fold together in a half moon, and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we might continue _ad infinitum_, but, as was stated before, it\r\nis not my object to instruct you in special cooking, but to illustrate in\r\nthis manner how much easier it is, to both the cook and your stomachs, to\r\nprepare healthful dishes than to do the reverse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME REQUIRED TO DIGEST DIFFERENT FOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Monitor de la Salud_ contains in a recent number the results of some\r\nexperiments lately made by E. Jessen on the time required for the\r\ndigestion of certain kinds of food. The stomach of the person on whom the\r\nexperiments were made was emptied by means of a pump; 100 grammes, equal\r\nto 1,544 grains, or about 2-2/3 ounces, of meat, finely chopped and mixed\r\nwith three times the quantity of water, were introduced. The experiment\r\nwas considered ended when the matter, on removal by the pump, was found to\r\ncontain no muscular fibre.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the gramme weighs nearly 15-1/2 grains, and the\r\ncubic centigramme is equal to 1 gramme. The 2-2/3 ounces of meat were\r\ntherefore mixed with nearly eight ounces of water, before being introduced\r\ninto the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe results were as follows:\r\n\r\n  Beef, raw, and finely chopped.  2  hours.\r\n    \"   half cooked.              2½   \"\r\n    \"   well cooked.              3    \"\r\n    \"   slightly roasted.         3    \"\r\n    \"   well roasted.             4    \"\r\n  Mutton, raw.                    2    \"\r\n  Veal.                           2½   \"\r\n  Pork.                           3    \"\r\n\r\nThe digestibility of milk was examined in the same way. The quantity used\r\nwas regulated so that the nitrogen should be the same as in the 100\r\ngrammes of beef.\r\n\r\n  602 cubic centimeters, nearly sixteen ounces,\r\n      of cow's milk, not boiled, required.        3½ hours\r\n  602 cubic centimeters, boiled.                  4    \"\r\n  602   \"       \"        sour.                    3½   \"\r\n  675   \"       \"        skimmed.                 3½   \"\r\n  656   \"       \"        goat's milk, not boiled. 3½   \"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIZATION AND PLAN OF THE UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Communicated to the National Academy of Sciences at the\r\nOctober meeting in 1884.]\r\n\r\nBy J.W. POWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Scientific institution or bureau operating under government authority\r\ncan be controlled by statute and by superior administrative authority but\r\nto a limited extent. These operations are practically carried on by\r\nspecialists, and they can be controlled only in their financial operations\r\nand in the general purposes for which investigations are made. Their\r\nmethods of investigation are their own--originate with themselves, and are\r\ncarried out by themselves. But in relation to the scientific operations of\r\nsuch a government institution, there is an unofficial authority which,\r\nthough not immediately felt, ultimately steps in to approve or condemn,\r\nviz., the body of scientific men of the country; and though their\r\nauthority is not exercised antecedently and at every stage of the work,\r\nyet it is so potent that no national scientific institution can grow and\r\nprosper without their approval, but must sooner or later fall and perish\r\nunless sustained by their strong influence.\r\n\r\nAs director of the Geological Survey, I deeply realize that I owe\r\nallegiance to the scientific men of the country, and for this reason I\r\ndesire to present to the National Academy of Sciences the organization and\r\nplan of operations of the Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TOPOGRAPHIC MAP OF THE UNITED STATUS.\r\n\r\nSound geologic research is based on geography. Without a good topographic\r\nmap geology cannot even be thoroughly studied, and the publication of the\r\nresults of geologic investigation is very imperfect without a good map;\r\nbut with a good map thorough investigation and simple, intelligible\r\npublication become possible. Impelled by these considerations, the Survey\r\nis making a topographic map of the United States. The geographic basis of\r\nthis map is a trigonometric survey by which datum points are established\r\nthroughout the country; that is, base-lines are measured and a\r\ntriangulation extended therefrom. This trigonometric work is executed on a\r\nscale only sufficiently refined for map-making purposes, and will not be\r\ndirectly useful for geodetic purposes in determining the figure of the\r\nearth. The hypsometric work is based upon the railroad levels of the\r\ncountry. Throughout the greater part of the country, there is a system of\r\nrailroad lines, constituting a net-work. The levels or profiles of these\r\nroads have been established with reasonable accuracy, and as they cross\r\neach other at a multiplicity of points, a system of checks is afforded, so\r\nthat the railroad surface of the country can be determined therefrom with\r\nall the accuracy necessary for the most refined and elaborate topographic\r\nmaps. From such a hypsometric basis the reliefs for the whole country are\r\ndetermined, by running lines of levels, by trigonometric construction, and\r\nin mountainous regions by barometric observation.\r\n\r\nThe primary triangulation having been made, the topography is executed by\r\na variety of methods, adapted to the peculiar conditions found in various\r\nportions of the country. To a large extent the plane-table is used. In the\r\nhands of the topographers of the Geological Survey, the plane-table is not\r\nsimply a portable draughting table for the field; it is practically an\r\ninstrument of triangulation, and all minor positions of the details of\r\ntopography are determined through its use by trigonometric construction.\r\n\r\nThe scale on which the map is made is variable. In some portions of the\r\nprairie region, and in the region of the great plains, the topography and\r\nthe geology alike are simple, and maps on a comparatively small scale are\r\nsufficient for practical purposes. For these districts it is proposed to\r\nconstruct the sheets of the map on a scale of 1-250,000, or about four\r\nmiles to the inch. In the mountain regions of the West the geology is more\r\ncomplex, and the topography more intricate; but to a large extent these\r\nregions are uninhabited, and to a more limited extent uninhabitable. It\r\nwould therefore not be wise to make a topographic or geologic survey of\r\nthe country on an excessively elaborate plan. Over much of this area the\r\nsheets of the map will also be constructed on a scale of 1-250,000, but in\r\nspecial districts that scale will be increased to 1-125,000, and in the\r\ncase of important mining districts charts will be constructed on a much\r\nlarger scale. In the eastern portion of the United States two scales are\r\nadopted. In the less densely populated country a scale of 1-125,000 is\r\nused; in the more densely populated regions a scale of 1-62,500 is\r\nadopted, or about one mile to the inch. But throughout the country a few\r\nspecial districts of great importance, because of complex geologic\r\nstructure, dense population, or other condition, will require charts on\r\nstill larger scales. The area of the United States, exclusive of Alaska,\r\nis about three million square miles, and a map of the United States,\r\nconstructed on the plan set forth above, will require not less than 2,600\r\nsheets. It may ultimately prove to require more than that, from the fact\r\nthat the areas to be surveyed on the larger scale have not been fully\r\ndetermined. Besides the number of sheets in the general map of the United\r\nStates, there will be several hundred special maps on large scales, as\r\nabove described.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief outline of the plan so far as it has been developed at the\r\npresent time. In this connection it should be stated that the map of the\r\nUnited States can be completed, with the present organization of the\r\nGeological Survey, in about 24 years; but it is greatly to be desired that\r\nthe time for its completion may be materially diminished by increasing the\r\ntopographic force of the Geological Survey. We ought to have a good\r\ntopographic map of the United States by the year 1900. About one-fifth of\r\nthe whole area of the United States, exclusive of Alaska, has been\r\ncompleted on the above plan. This includes all geographic work done in the\r\nUnited States under the auspices of the General Government and under the\r\nauspices of State Governments. The map herewith shows those areas that\r\nhave been surveyed by various organizations on such a scale and in such a\r\nmanner that the work has been accepted as sufficient for the purposes of\r\nthe Survey.\r\n\r\nMuch other work has been done, but not with sufficient refinement and\r\naccuracy to be of present value, though such work subserved its purpose in\r\nits time. An examination of the map will show that the triangulation of\r\nthe various organizations is already largely in advance of the topography.\r\nThe map of the United States will be a great atlas divided into sheets as\r\nabove indicated. In all of those areas where the survey is on a scale of\r\n1-250,000, a page of the atlas will present an area of one degree in\r\nlongitude and one degree in latitude. Where the scale is 1-125,000, a page\r\nof the atlas-sheet will represent one-fourth of a degree. Where the scale\r\nis 1-62,500, the atlas-sheet will represent one-sixteenth of a degree. The\r\ndegree sheet will be designated by two numbers--one representing latitude,\r\nthe other longitude. Where the sheets represent fractional degrees, they\r\nwill be labeled with the same numbers, with the addition of the\r\ndescription of the proper fractional part.\r\n\r\nThe organization, as at present established, executing this work, is as\r\nfollows: First, an astronomic and computing division, the officers of\r\nwhich are engaged in determining the geographic coordinates of certain\r\nprimary points. Second, a triangulation corps engaged in extending a\r\nsystem of triangulation over various portions of the country from measured\r\nbase-lines. Third, a topographic corps, organized into twenty-seven\r\nparties, scattered over various portions of the United States. Such, in\r\nbrief outline, is the plan for the map of the United States, and the\r\norganization by which it is to be made. Mr. Henry Gannett is the Chief\r\nGeographer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALEONTOLOGY.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the outline of the plan for the general geologic survey, it\r\nwill be better to explain the accessory plans and organizations. There are\r\nin the Survey, as at present organized, the following paleontologic\r\nlaboratories:\r\n\r\n1. A laboratory of vertebrate paleontology for formations other than the\r\nQuaternary. In connection with this laboratory there is a corps of\r\npaleontologists. Professor O.C. Marsh is in charge.\r\n\r\n2. There is a laboratory of invertebrate paleontology of Quaternary age,\r\nwith a corps of paleontologists, Mr. Wm. H. Dall being in charge.\r\n\r\n3. There is a laboratory of invertebrate paleontology of Cenozoic and\r\nMesozoic age, with a corps of paleontologists. Dr. C.A. White is in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n4. There is a laboratory of invertebrate paleontology of Paleozoic age,\r\nwith a corps of paleontologists. Mr. C.D. Walcott is in charge.\r\n\r\n5. There is a laboratory of fossil botany, with a corps of paleobotanists,\r\nMr. Lester F. Ward being in charge.\r\n\r\nThe paleontologists and paleobotanists connected with the laboratories\r\nabove described, study and discuss in reports the fossils collected by the\r\ngeneral geologists in the field. They also supplement the work of the\r\nfield geologists by making special collections in important districts and\r\nat critical horizons; but the paleontologists are not held responsible for\r\nareal and structural geology on the one hand, and the geologists are not\r\nheld responsible for paleontology on the other hand. In addition to the\r\nlarge number of paleontologists on the regular work of the Geological\r\nSurvey, as above described, several paleontologists are engaged from time\r\nto time to make special studies.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\nThere is a chemic laboratory attached to the Survey, with a large corps of\r\nchemists engaged in a great variety of researches relating to the\r\nconstitution of waters, minerals, ores, and rocks. A part of the work of\r\nthis corps is to study the methods of metamorphism and the paragenesis of\r\nminerals, and in this connection the chemists do work in the field; but to\r\na large extent they are occupied with the study of the materials collected\r\nby the field geologists. Professor F.W. Clarke is in charge of this\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL RESEARCHES.\r\n\r\nThere is a physical laboratory in the Survey, with a small corps of men\r\nengaged in certain physical researches of prime importance to geologic\r\nphilosophy. These researches are experimental, and relate to the effect of\r\ntemperatures, pressures, etc., on rocks. This laboratory is under the\r\ncharge of the chief chemist.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITHOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThere is a lithologic laboratory in the Survey, with a large corps of\r\nlithologists engaged in the microscopic study of rocks. These lithologists\r\nare field geologists, who examine the collections made by themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICS.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Survey a division of mining statistics, with a large corps\r\nof men engaged in statistic work, the results of which are published in an\r\nannual report entitled \"Mineral Resources.\" Mr. Albert Williams, Jr., is\r\nthe Chief Statistician of the Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\nThere is in the Survey a division organized for the purpose of preparing\r\nillustrations for paleontologic and geologic reports. Mr. W.H. Holmes is\r\nin charge of this division. Illustrations will not hereafter be used for\r\nembellishment, but will be strictly confined to the illustration of the\r\ntext and the presentation of such facts as can be best exhibited by\r\nfigures and diagrams. All illustrations will, as far as possible, be\r\nproduced by relief methods, such as wood-engraving, photo-engraving, etc.\r\nAs large numbers of the reports of the Survey are published, this plan is\r\ndemanded for economic reasons; but there is another consideration believed\r\nto be of still greater importance; illustrations made on stone cannot be\r\nused after the first edition, as they deteriorate somewhat by time, and it\r\nis customary to use the same lithographic stone for various purposes from\r\ntime to time. The illustrations made for the reports of the Survey, if on\r\nrelief-plates that can be cheaply electrotyped, can be used again when\r\nneeded. This is especially desirable in paleontology, where previously\r\npublished figures can be introduced for comparative purposes. There are\r\ntwo methods of studying the extinct life of the globe. Fossils are indices\r\nof geological formations, and must be grouped by formations to subserve\r\nthe purpose of geologists. Fossils also have their biologic relations, and\r\nshould be studied and arranged in biologic groups. Under the plan adopted\r\nby the Survey, the illustrations can be used over and over again for such\r\npurposes when needed, as reproduction can be made at the small cost of\r\nelectrotyping. These same illustrations can be used by the public at large\r\nin scientific periodicals, text-books, etc. All the illustrations made by\r\nthe Geological Survey are held for the public to be used in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBRARY.\r\n\r\nThe library of the Survey now contains more than 25,000 volumes, and is\r\nrapidly growing by means of exchanges. It is found necessary to purchase\r\nbut few books. The librarian, Mr. C.C. Darwin, has a corps of assistants\r\nengaged in bibliographic work. It is proposed to prepare a catalogue of\r\nAmerican and foreign publications upon American geology, which is to be a\r\ngeneral authors' catalogue. In addition to this, it is proposed to publish\r\nbibliographies proper of special subjects constituting integral parts of\r\nthe science of geology.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Survey are in three series: Annual Reports,\r\nBulletins, and Monographs. The Annual Report constitutes a part of the\r\nReport of the Secretary of the Interior for each year, but is a distinct\r\nvolume. This contains a brief summary of the purposes, plans, and\r\noperations of the Survey, prepared by the Director, and short\r\nadministrative reports from the chiefs of divisions, the whole followed by\r\nscientific papers. These papers are selected as being those of most\r\ngeneral interest, the object being to make the Annual Report a somewhat\r\npopular account of the doings of the Survey, that it may be widely read by\r\nthe intelligent people of the country. Of this 5,650 copies are published\r\nas a part of the Secretary's report, and are distributed by the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, Senators, and Members of the House of Representatives;\r\nand an extra edition is annually ordered of 15,000 copies, distributed by\r\nthe Survey and members of the Senate and House of Representatives. Four\r\nannual reports have been published; the fifth is now in the hands of the\r\nprinter.\r\n\r\nThe Bulletins of the Survey are short papers, and through them somewhat\r\nspeedy publication is attained. Each bulletin is devoted to some specific\r\ntopic, in order that the material ultimately published in the bulletins\r\ncan be classified in any manner desired by scientific men. Nine bulletins\r\nhave been published, and seven are in press. The bulletins already\r\npublished vary in size from 5 to 325 pages each; they are sold at the cost\r\nof press-work and paper, and vary in price from five to twenty cents each;\r\n4,900 copies of each bulletin are published; 1,900 are distributed by\r\nCongress, 3,000 are held for sale and exchange by the Geological Survey.\r\n\r\nThe Monographs of the Survey are quarto volumes. By this method of\r\npublication the more important and elaborate papers are given to the\r\npublic. Six monographs, with two atlases, have been issued; five\r\nmonographs, with two atlases, are in press; 1,900 copies of each monograph\r\nare distributed by Congress; 3,000 are held for sale and exchange by the\r\nSurvey at the cost of press-work, paper, and binding. They vary in price\r\nfrom $1.05 to $11.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of divisions supervise the publications that originate in their\r\nseveral corps. The general editorial supervision is exercised by the Chief\r\nClerk of the Survey, Mr. James C. Pilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nIn organizing the general geologic work, it became necessary, first, to\r\nconsider what had already been done in various portions of the United\r\nStates; and for this purpose the compilation of a general geologic map of\r\nthe United States was begun, together with a Thesaurus of American\r\nformations. In addition to this the bibliographic work previously\r\ndescribed was initiated, so that the literature relating to American\r\ngeology should be readily accessible to the workers in the Survey. At this\r\npoint it became necessary to consider the best methods of apportioning the\r\nwork; that is, the best methods of dividing the geologic work into parts\r\nto be assigned to the different corps of observers. A strictly geographic\r\napportionment was not deemed wise, from the fact that an unscientific\r\ndivision of labor would result, and the same classes of problems would to\r\na large extent be relegated to the several corps operating in field and in\r\nthe laboratory. It was thought best to divide the work, as far as\r\npossible, by subject-matter rather than by territorial areas; yet to some\r\nextent the two methods of division will coincide. There are in the Survey\r\nat present:\r\n\r\nFirst, a division of glacial geology, and Prof. T.C. Chamberlin, formerly\r\nState Geologist of Wisconsin is at its head, with a strong corps of\r\nassistants. There is an important field for which definite provision has\r\nnot yet been made, namely, the study of the loess that constitutes the\r\nbluff formations of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. But as this\r\nloess proves to be intimately associated with the glacial formations of\r\nthe same region, it is probable that it will eventually be relegated to\r\nthe glacial division. Perhaps the division may eventually grow to such an\r\nextent that its field of operations will include the whole Quaternary\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nSecond, a division of volcanic geology is organized, and Capt. Clarence E.\r\nDutton, of the Ordnance Corps of the Army, is placed in charge, also with\r\na strong corps of assistants.\r\n\r\nThird and fourth, two divisions have been organized to prosecute work on\r\nthe archæan rocks, embracing within their field not only all rocks of\r\narchæan age, but all metamorphic crystalline schists, of whatever age they\r\nmay be found. The first division has for its chief Prof. Raphael Pumpelly,\r\nassisted by a corps of geologists, and the field of his work is the\r\ncrystalline schists of the Appalachian region, or eastern portion of the\r\nUnited States, extending from northern New England to Georgia. He will\r\nalso include in his studies certain paleozoic formations which are\r\nimmediately connected with the crystalline schists and involved in their\r\norographic structure.\r\n\r\nThe second division for the study of this class of rocks is in charge of\r\nProf. Roland D. Irving, with a corps of geologists, and his field of\r\noperation is in the Lake Superior region. It is not proposed at present to\r\nundertake the study of the crystalline schists of the Rocky Mountain\r\nregion.\r\n\r\nFifth, another division has been organized for the study of the areal,\r\nstructural, and historical geology of the Appalachian region, extending\r\nfrom the Atlantic, westward, to the zone which separates the mountain\r\nregion from the great valley of the Mississippi. Mr. G.K. Gilbert has\r\ncharge of this work, and has a large corps of assistants.\r\n\r\nSixth, it seemed desirable, partly for scientific reasons and partly for\r\nadministrative reasons, that a thorough topographic and geologic survey\r\nshould be made of the Yellowstone Park, and Mr. Arnold Hague is in charge\r\nof the work, with a corps of assistants. When it is completed, his field\r\nwill be expanded so as to include a large part of the Rocky Mountain\r\nregion, but the extent of the field is not yet determined.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the general geologic work relating to those\r\nareas where the terranes are composed of fossiliferous formations is very\r\nimperfectly and incompletely organized. The reason for this is twofold:\r\nFirst, the work cannot be performed very successfully until the maps are\r\nmade; second, the Geological Survey is necessarily diverting much of its\r\nforce to the construction of maps, and cannot with present appropriations\r\nexpand the geologic corps so as to extend systematic work in the field\r\nover the entire country.\r\n\r\n\r\nECONOMIC GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nUnder the organic law of the Geological Survey, investigations in economic\r\ngeology are restricted to those States and Territories in which there are\r\npublic lands; the extension of the work into the eastern portion of the\r\nUnited States included only that part relating to general geology. Two\r\nmining divisions are organized. One, in charge of Mr. George F. Becker,\r\nwith headquarters at San Francisco, California, is at the present time\r\nengaged in the study of the quicksilver districts of California. The\r\nother, under charge of Mr. S.F. Emmons, with headquarters at Denver,\r\nColorado, is engaged in studying various mining districts in that State,\r\nincluding silver, gold, iron, and coal areas. Each division has a corps of\r\nassistants. The lignite coals of the upper Missouri, also, are under\r\ninvestigation by Mr. Bailey Willis, with a corps of assistants.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPLOYES.\r\n\r\nThe employes on the Geological Survey at the close of September, 1884,\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\nAppointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the\r\nSenate (Director), 1.\r\n\r\nAppointed by the Secretary of the Interior, on the recommendation of the\r\nDirector of the Survey, 134.\r\n\r\nEmployed by the chiefs of parties in the field, 148.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPOINTMENTS.\r\n\r\nThree classes of appointments are made on the Survey. The statute provides\r\nthat \"the scientific employes of the Geological Survey shall be selected\r\nby the Director, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior,\r\nexclusively for their qualifications as professional experts.\" The\r\nprovisions of this statute apply to all those cases where scientific men\r\nare employed who have established a reputation, and in asking for their\r\nappointment the Director specifically states his reasons, setting forth\r\nthe work in which the person is to be employed, together with his\r\nqualifications, especially enumerating and characterizing his published\r\nworks. On such recommendations appointments are invariably made. Young men\r\nwho have not established a reputation in scientific research are selected\r\nthrough the agency of the Civil Service Commission on special examination,\r\nthe papers for which are prepared in the Geological Survey. About one-half\r\nof the employes, however, are temporary, being engaged for services\r\nlasting for a few days or a few months only, largely in the field, and\r\ncoming under two classes: Skilled laborers and common laborers. Such\r\npersons are employed by the Director or by the heads of divisions, and are\r\ndischarged from the service when no longer needed. It will be seen that\r\nthe Director is responsible for the selection of the employes, directly\r\nfor those whom he recommends for appointment, and indirectly for those\r\nselected by the Civil Service Commission, as he permanently retains in the\r\nwork. If, then, improper persons are employed, it is wholly the Director's\r\nfault.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations made for the Geological Survey for the fiscal year\r\nending June 30, 1885, aggregate the sum of $504,040. This sum does not\r\ninclude the amount appropriated for ethnologic researches--$40,000. Nor\r\nare the expenses for engraving and printing paid for from the above\r\nappropriations, but from appropriations made for the work under the\r\ndirection of the public printer. It is estimated that the amount needed\r\nfor engraving and printing for the same fiscal year will exceed $200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELATION OF THE GOVERNMENT SURVEY TO STATE SURVEYS.\r\n\r\nThe United States Geological Survey is on friendly relations with the\r\nvarious State Surveys. Between the Government Survey and the State Survey\r\nof New York, there is direct co-operation. The State Survey of\r\nPennsylvania has rendered valuable assistance to the Government Survey,\r\nand negotiations have been entered into for closer relations and more\r\nthorough co-operation. The State Surveys of North Carolina, Kentucky, and\r\nAlabama are also co-operating with the Government Survey, and the director\r\nof the Government Survey is doing all within his power to revive State\r\nSurveys. The field for geologic research in the United States is of great\r\nmagnitude, and the best results can be accomplished only by the labors of\r\nmany scientific men engaged for a long term of years. For this reason it\r\nis believed that surveys should be established in all of the States and\r\nTerritories. There is work enough for all, and the establishment of local\r\nsurveys would greatly assist the general work prosecuted under the\r\nauspices of the government, and prevent it from falling into perfunctory\r\nchannels. Its vigor and health will doubtless be promoted by all thorough\r\nlocal research.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to scientific men to know that the Director finds\r\nthat in presenting the general results, interests, and needs of the Survey\r\nto Congress, and to Committees of Congress, a thorough appreciation of the\r\nvalue of scientific research is shown by the statesmen of the country.\r\nQuestions relating to immediately economic values are asked, as they\r\nshould be; but questions relating to sound administration, wise methods of\r\ninvestigation, and important scientific results are vigorously urged, and\r\nthe principle is recognized that all sound scientific research conduces to\r\nthe welfare of the people, not only by increasing knowledge, but\r\nultimately by affecting all the industries of the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[THE GARDEN.]\r\n\r\nTHE SUNFLOWERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOWER OF HELIANTHUS ARGOPHYLLUS.]\r\n\r\nThe genus Helianthus is almost entirely North-American, and for the\r\ndistinction and limitation of its species we are indebted to the labor of\r\nDr. Asa Gray, now universally recognized as the highest authority on North\r\nAmerican plants. In the recently published second part of his \"Synoptical\r\nFlora of North America\" he has described thirty-nine species, six of which\r\nare annual. The synonyms and cross-naming adopted by previous authors have\r\nled to much confusion, which probably will not now be altogether cleared\r\nup, for Dr. Gray warns us that the characters of some of the species are\r\nvariable, especially in cultivation. It may be added that some at least of\r\nthe species readily form hybrids. There is always more or less difficulty\r\nwith a variable genus in making garden plants fit wild specific types, but\r\nin the following notes I have described no kinds which I have not myself\r\ncultivated, selecting the best forms and giving them the names assigned\r\nseverally by Dr. Gray to the species to which our garden plants seem to\r\ncome nearest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELIANTHUS ARGOPHYLLUS, SHOWING HABIT OF GROWTH.]\r\n\r\n_Helianthus multiflorus_, or, according to Asa Gray, speaking botanically,\r\nH. decapetalus hort. var. multiflorus, is mentioned first, because it is\r\nthe subject of the colored illustration. The name multiflorus is\r\nestablished by long usage, and perhaps was originally given in contrast to\r\nthe few-flowered habit of H. annuus, for the type of the species is more\r\nfloriferous than the variety of which Asa Gray says that it is \"known only\r\nin cultivation from early times, must have been derived from\r\ndecapetalus,\" a statement which gardeners would hardly have accepted on\r\nless indisputable authority, as they will all think the habit and\r\nappearance of the two plants widely different. The variety multiflorus has\r\nseveral forms; the commonest form is double, the disk being filled with\r\nligules much shorter than those of the ray flowers, after the form of many\r\ndaisy-like composites. In this double form the day flowers are often\r\nwanting. It is common also on old plants in poor soils to see double and\r\nsingle flowers from the same root. In the single forms the size of the\r\nflowers varies, the difference being due to cultivation as often as to\r\nkind. I have obtained by far the finest flowers by the following\r\ntreatment: In early spring, when the young shoots are about an inch high,\r\ncut some off, each with a portion of young root, and plant them singly in\r\ndeep rich soil, and a sheltered but not shaded situation. By August each\r\nwill have made a large bush, branching out from one stalk at the base,\r\nwith from thirty to forty flowers open at a time, each 5 inches across.\r\nThe same plants if well dressed produce good flowers the second season,\r\nbut after that the stalks become crowded, and the flowers degenerate. The\r\nsame treatment suits most of the perennial sunflowers. The following kinds\r\nare mentioned in the order in which they occur in Asa Gray's book:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELIANTHUS MULTIFLORUS, SHOWING HABIT OF GROWTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUALS.\r\n\r\n_H. argophyllus_ (white-leaved, not argyrophyllus, silver-leaved, as\r\nwritten in some catalogues).--An annual with woolly leaves, neater and\r\nless coarse than H. annuus, with which it is said soon to degenerate in\r\ngardens if grown together with it.\r\n\r\n_H. annuus._--The well known sunflower in endless varieties, one of the\r\nmost elegant having pale lemon-colored flowers; these, too, liable to pass\r\ninto the common type if grown in the same garden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELIANTHUS ORGYALIS, SHOWING HABIT OF GROWTH IN\r\nAUTUMN.]\r\n\r\n_H. debilis var. cucumerifolius._--I have never seen the typical species,\r\nbut the variety was introduced a few years ago by Mr. W. Thompson, of\r\nIpswich, from whose seed I have grown it. It becomes 4 feet or 5 feet\r\nhigh, with irregularly toothed deltoid leaves and spotted stalks, making a\r\nwidely branched bush and bearing well-shaped golden flowers more than 3\r\ninches across, with black disks. It crosses with any perennial sunflower\r\nthat grows near it, simulating their flowers in an annual form. I had a\r\nvery fine cross with it and H. annuus, but the flowers of this produced no\r\ngood seed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE (HELIANTHUS TUBEROSUS).]\r\n\r\n\r\nPERENNIALS.\r\n\r\n_H. orgyalis_ (the fathom-high sunflower).--The name is far within the\r\ntrue measure, which is often 9 feet or 10 feet. A very distinct species,\r\nincreasing very slowly at the root and throwing all its growing efforts\r\nupward. The long linear ribbon leaves, often exceeding a foot, spreading\r\nin wavy masses round the tall stem, which has a palm-like tuft of them at\r\nthe summit, are a more ornamental feature than the flowers, which are\r\nmoderate in size and come late in the axils of the upper leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELIANTHUS ANNUUS GLOBULUS FISTULOSUS.]\r\n\r\n_H. angustifolius._--A neat and elegant species, which I first raised from\r\nseed sent by Mr. W. Thompson, of Ipswich. It has a very branching habit\r\nquite from the base like a well-grown bush of the common wallflower. The\r\nflowers are abundant, about 2½ inches across, with a black disk. The\r\nplant, though a true herb, never comes up in my garden with more than one\r\nstalk each year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELIANTHUS RIGIDUS (SYN. HARPALIUM RIGIDUM).]\r\n\r\n_H. rigidus_ is well known as the best of the perennial sunflowers, and\r\nhas many synonyms, the commonest Harpalium rigidum. It need not be\r\ndescribed, but one or two things about it may be noted. The shoots, which\r\ncome up a yard or more from last year's stalk, may be transplanted as soon\r\nas they appear without injury to the flowering, but if put back to the old\r\ncenter, the soil, which should be deep and light, ought to be enriched.\r\nThe species is variable, and improved forms may be expected, as it\r\nproduces seed in England. The number of ray flowers is often very large. I\r\nhave one form which has several rows of them, nearly hiding the disk. A\r\nvariety is figured in _Botanical Magazine_, tab. 2,668, under the name of\r\nH. atro-rubens. Another comes in the same series, tab. 2,020, as H.\r\ndiffusus. Other synonyms are H. missuricus and H. missouriensis. Its\r\nnative range extends across North America in longitude, and covers many\r\ndegrees of latitude. It likes a dry soil. In wet soil and wet seasons the\r\nflower-stalk is apt to wither in the middle, and the bud falls over and\r\nperishes prematurely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMMON SUNFLOWER (H. ANNUUS) SHOWING HABIT OF GROWTH.]\r\n\r\n_H. Lætiflorus._--Under this name we grow in England a tall,\r\nmuch-branched, late flowering kind, with smooth and very stout and stiff\r\nstalks, sometimes black, sometimes green. It increases at the base of the\r\nstalks; it makes close growth, and shows little disposition to run at the\r\nroot. The flowers are rather small, not more than 9 inches across, but so\r\ndurable and so well displayed by the numerous spreading branches as to\r\nmake the plant very useful for late decoration. I own that I cannot\r\nidentify this plant with the lætiflorus of Asa Gray, which he tells us\r\nresembles tall forms of H. rigidus, with rough stalks, and bears flowers\r\nwith numerous rays 1½ inches long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLOWER OF HELIANTHUS ANNUUS.]\r\n\r\n_H. occidentalis._--Recently introduced by Mr. W. Thompson, of Ipswich,\r\nwho gave me the plant two years ago. It is a neat species, growing about 2\r\nfeet high, well branched, and producing at the end of July abundance of\r\nflowers about 2 inches across. The lower leaves are small and broad, with\r\nlong stalks, ovate in form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HELIANTHUS MULTIFLORUS FL-PL.]\r\n\r\n_H. mollis_, so called from the soft white down with which the leaves are\r\ncovered, grows about 4 feet high. Leaves large, ovate, and sessile; growth\r\nof the plant upright, with hardly any branches; flowers pale yellow, about\r\n3 inches across, not very ornamental. Cultivated at Kew, whence I had it.\r\n\r\n_H. giganteus_ grows 10 feet high; stem much branched and disposed to\r\ncurve. Flowers about 2½ inches across, produced abundantly in August; rays\r\nnarrow and pointed, cupped, with the ends turning outward; leaves\r\nlanceolate and sessile; rootstock creeping, forming tuberous thickenings\r\nat the base of the stems, which Asa Gray tells us were \"the Indian potato\r\nof the Assiniboine tribe,\" mentioned by Douglas, who called the plant H.\r\ntuberosus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FULL SIZED FLOWER OF HELIANTHUS MULTIFLORUS.]\r\n\r\n_H. maximiliani._--Half the height of the last, which it resembles, but\r\nthe stem is stouter, the leaves larger, as are also the flowers, which are\r\nproduced later. It is not so floriferous and ornamental as the last.\r\n\r\n_H. lævigatus._--Smooth stalked, very distinct, does not spread at the\r\nroots, which are composed of finer fibers than those of most of the genus;\r\nstalks slender and black, growing closely together, branched near the\r\nsummit, 5 feet high; leaves narrowly lanceolate and acute; flowers\r\nplentiful and about 2 inches across; rays few, and disk small.\r\n\r\nWe are warned that the following species are \"difficult of extrication,\"\r\neither confluent or mixed by intercrossing.\r\n\r\n_H. doronicoides._--I place this the third in merit among perennial\r\nsunflowers, H. rigidus and H. multiflorus being first and second. It is 6\r\nfeet or 7 feet high, upright in growth, with many stalks. Flowers 3½\r\ninches across, produced from the end of July to the end of September,\r\nbright golden yellow; leaves large, ovate, tapering from the middle to\r\nboth ends; stalk leaves sessile and nearly connate, that is, clasping the\r\nstalk by their opposite base. The plant spreads rapidly by running\r\nrootstocks, and ripens seed in abundance. Figured as H. pubescens in\r\n_Botanical Magazine_, tab. 2,778.\r\n\r\n_H. divaricatus_ resembles the last, but is inferior, being a smaller\r\nplant in all parts, especially in the flowers, which come out a month\r\nlater. The cauline leaves are stalked and diverge widely, which habit\r\ngives its name to the plant. A casual observer would hardly notice the\r\ndifference between this species and the last, but when grown together the\r\nsuperiority of doronicoides as a garden plant is at once evident.\r\n\r\n_H. strumosus._--Fully 6 feet high; growth upright; rootstock less\r\nspreading than the last two; leaves on very short stalks, broadest at the\r\nbase, ovate tapering by a long narrow point; flower disk narrow, but rays\r\nlarge and orange-yellow; flowers showy, 3 inches across; they come out\r\nlate in August. I had this plant from Kew. The shape of the leaves would\r\nhave led me rather to refer it to H. trachelifolius, a closely allied\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_H. decapetalus._--Five feet high; flowers from end of July; makes a dense\r\nforest of weak, slender stalks, much branched at the top; spreads fast;\r\nleaves serrate, oblong-ovate, rather large; flowers abundant, pale yellow,\r\nabout 2 inches across; rays nearly always more than ten, in spite of the\r\nname.\r\n\r\n_H. tuberosus._--The well-known Jerusalem artichoke; not a plant grown for\r\nornament, being too coarse and late in flowering, but several things in\r\nits history may be mentioned, as Dr. Asa Gray has spent labor and study\r\nover it. It is believed to have been cultivated by the natives before the\r\ndiscovery of America, and the edible tubers are thought to be a\r\ndevelopment of cultivation. Forms of it without tuberous roots are found\r\nwild, but whether indigenous to the place or degenerate from cultivation\r\nwas for long uncertain. Several species of Helianthus have a tendency to\r\nproduce similar fleshy tubers at the top of the roots. Dr. Gray used to\r\nrefer the origin of this species to H. doronicoides, but it is now\r\nbelieved by him to be a distinct species, though one of which it is\r\ndifficult to identify with certainty the typical form.\r\n\r\nI omitted to say that the word Helianthus is Greek for sunflower. After\r\nseveral years' careful observation, I believe the notion that the flowers\r\nkeep their face to the sun is quite a delusion.\r\n\r\nEdge Hall. C. WOLLEY DOD.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUICK FILTER.--The _Druggists Circular_ recommends chamois skin, free\r\nfrom thin places; cut it of the desired size; wash it in a weak solution\r\nof sal soda, or any alkali, to remove the grease, and rinse thoroughly in\r\ncold water before using.\r\n\r\nTinctures, elixirs, sirups, and even mucilages are filtered rapidly. A\r\npint of the thickest sirup will run through in four or five minutes. By\r\nwashing thoroughly after each time of using, it will last a long time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLYE'S FUCHSIAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe group of fuchsias shown in our engraving represents a collection of\r\nnine specimens raised and exhibited by that well known cultivator, Mr.\r\nJames Lye, of Clyffe Hall Gardens, Market Lavington, at an exhibition held\r\nin Bath in September last, and which received the first prize in the\r\npremier class for that number of plants. For many years past Mr. Lye has\r\nexhibited fuchsias at exhibitions held at Bath, Trowbridge, Devizes,\r\nCalne, Chippenham, and elsewhere; on all occasions staging specimens of a\r\nhigh order of merit; but the plants appearing in our illustration were\r\nuniversally regarded as the best he had ever placed in an exhibition tent.\r\nSo much were the committee of the Bath show pleased with the specimens\r\nthat they engaged the services of a photographer to make a picture of them\r\non the spot; but after being two hours making the attempt, no satisfactory\r\nresult occurred. After the plants were taken back to Clyffe Hall, they\r\nwere photographed as seen in the illustration. Some idea of their height\r\nand dimensions can be realized by a comparison with the stature of Mr.\r\nLye, who is standing by his plants, and who is of average height. It\r\nshould be mentioned that previous to being photographed they had traveled\r\nby road from Market Lavington to Bath and back, a distance of 52 miles, in\r\naddition to having been exhibited two days. They returned to their home\r\napparently little the worse for wear, which immunity from harm is no doubt\r\nowing to the admirable system of tying adopted by Mr. Lye. It is sometimes\r\nsaid that the act of trying in the flowering shoots in this manner gives\r\nthe plants a somewhat severely formal appearance, but there is an\r\nabundance of healthy foliage and a wonderful profusion of finely developed\r\nflowers, showing the most careful and painstaking cultivation. It is only\r\nthose who are privileged to see these unrivaled plants who can appreciate\r\nthem at their proper worth.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated already that the varieties figured are all of Mr. Lye's\r\nown raising, which facts attests to the value of his seedlings, many of\r\nwhich he has produced. Four of these are dark varieties, viz., Bountiful,\r\nCharming, Elegance, and the Hon. Mrs. Hay--the latter one of the oldest,\r\nbut one of the freest, and scarcely without an equal for its great freedom\r\nof bloom. The remaining five are light varieties, viz., Lye's Favorite,\r\nHarriet Lye, Star of Wilts, Pink Perfection, and Beauty of the West.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. LYE'S FUSCHIAS.]\r\n\r\nThe specimens figured average from two to five years of age. It is really\r\nmarvelous what Mr. Lye can do with a fuchsia in two years; and lest it\r\nmight be supposed that he has plenty of glass accommodation, and can keep\r\nhis plants under glass continuously, it is due to him it should be stated\r\nthat he is very deficient in house accommodation, having but two small\r\nhouses, in one of which (an old house) he winters his plants and brings\r\nthem on until he can place them with safety in the open air in early\r\nsummer. His method of treating the specimens as set forth in his own words\r\nmay prove helpful to some of our readers: \"After the plants have done\r\nflowering, say about the third week in October, I cut them back into the\r\nshape best fitted to form symmetrical specimens, and keep them dry for a\r\nweek or ten days, to check the bleeding of sap which follows; after that I\r\ngive a little water just to start them into growth, so as to make shoots\r\nabout three-quarters of an inch in length, in order to keep the old wood\r\nactive and living. I keep them in a cold house, and give but very little\r\nwater until the first or second week in February, when I shake the old\r\nsoil from the roots, and re-pot them into a fresh compost made up of three\r\nparts good loam, one part well decomposed manure, and one part leaf-mould\r\nand peat, with a good bit of silver or sea sand to keep it open. In order\r\nto make large specimens, they are shifted as soon as the pots are filled\r\nwith roots. About the first week in June I place them out of doors on a\r\nborder somewhat sheltered, and syringe the plants freely every day during\r\nhot weather to keep the foliage clean and healthy. I top them back till\r\nabout seven or eight weeks before I want to show them, according to the\r\nrequirements of the variety, as some of them require it to be done more\r\nfreely than others. I give them liquid manure, using what I get from the\r\ncows, which with some soot is put into a tub, and allowed to stand a week\r\nor ten days before using, and I give them a good dose once a week as they\r\nshow signs of flowering.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve his plants from the effects of hail and very heavy\r\nrains, a rough framework is erected, and over this is stretched some\r\nfloral shading, which can be readily removed when required; it also serves\r\nthe purpose of shading the plants from the sun in very hot and scorching\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nDuring his career as an exhibitor of fuchsias Mr. Lye has taken nearly one\r\nhundred first prizes--a measure of success which fully justifies the\r\nbestowal of the title of being the Champion Fuchsia Grower of his\r\nday.--_R.D. in The Gardeners' Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific papers\r\nheretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this office.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished Weekly.
