I am not sure which gave me the more\r\ntrouble. For I have not been one of those fortunate persons who are able\r\nto regard a popular lecture as a mere _hors d'oeuvre_, unworthy of being\r\nranked among the serious efforts of a philosopher; and who keep their\r\nfame as scientific hierophants unsullied by attempts--at least of the\r\nsuccessful sort--to be understanded of the people.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I found that the task of putting the truths learned in\r\nthe field, the laboratory and the museum, into language which, without\r\nbating a jot of scientific accuracy shall be generally intelligible,\r\ntaxed such scientific and literary faculty as I possessed to the\r\nuttermost; indeed my experience has furnished me with no better\r\ncorrective of the tendency to scholastic pedantry which besets all those\r\nwho are absorbed in pursuits remote from the common ways of men, and\r\nbecome habituated to think and speak in the technical dialect of their\r\nown little world, as if there were no other.\r\n\r\nIf the popular lecture thus, as I believe, finds one moiety of its\r\njustification in the self-discipline of the lecturer, it surely finds the\r\nother half in its effect on the auditory. For though various sadly\r\ncomical experiences of the results of my own efforts have led me to\r\nentertain a very moderate estimate of the purely intellectual value of\r\nlectures; though I venture to doubt if more than one in ten of an average\r\naudience carries away an accurate notion of what the speaker has been\r\ndriving at; yet is that not equally true of the oratory of the hustings,\r\nof the House of Commons, and even of the pulpit?\r\n\r\nYet the children of this world are wise in their generation; and both the\r\npolitician and the priest are justified by results. The living voice has\r\nan influence over human action altogether independent of the intellectual\r\nworth of that which it utters. Many years ago, I was a guest at a great\r\nCity dinner. A famous orator, endowed with a voice of rare flexibility\r\nand power; a born actor, ranging with ease through every part, from\r\nrefined comedy to tragic unction, was called upon to reply to a toast.\r\nThe orator was a very busy man, a charming conversationalist and by no\r\nmeans despised a good dinner; and, I imagine, rose without having given a\r\nthought to what he was going to say. The rhythmic roll of sound was\r\nadmirable, the gestures perfect, the earnestness impressive; nothing was\r\nlacking save sense and, occasionally, grammar. When the speaker sat down\r\nthe applause was terrific and one of my neighbours was especially\r\nenthusiastic. So when he had quieted down, I asked him what the orator\r\nhad said. And he could not tell me.\r\n\r\nThat sagacious person John Wesley, is reported to have replied to some\r\none who questioned the propriety of his adaptation of sacred words to\r\nextremely secular airs, that he did not see why the Devil should be left\r\nin possession of all the best tunes. And I do not see why science should\r\nnot turn to account the peculiarities of human nature thus exploited by\r\nother agencies: all the more because science, by the nature of its being,\r\ncannot desire to stir the passions, or profit by the weaknesses, of human\r\nnature. The most zealous of popular lecturers can aim at nothing more\r\nthan the awakening of a sympathy for abstract truth, in those who do not\r\nreally follow his arguments; and of a desire to know more and better in\r\nthe few who do.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be admitted that the popularization of science,\r\nwhether by lecture or essay, has its drawbacks. Success in this\r\ndepartment has its perils for those who succeed. The \"people who fail\"\r\ntake their revenge, as we have recently had occasion to observe, by\r\nignoring all the rest of a man's work and glibly labelling him a more\r\npopularizer. If the falsehood were not too glaring, they would say the\r\nsame of Faraday and Helmholtz and Kelvin.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, of the affliction caused by persons who think that\r\nwhat they have picked up from popular exposition qualifies them for\r\ndiscussing the great problems of science, it may be said, as the Radical\r\ntoast said of the power of the Crown in bygone days, that it \"has\r\nincreased, is increasing, and ought to be diminished.\" The oddities of\r\n\"English as she is spoke\" might be abundantly paralleled by those of\r\n\"Science as she is misunderstood\" in the sermon, the novel, and the\r\nleading article; and a collection of the grotesque travesties of\r\nscientific conceptions, in the shape of essays on such trifles as \"the\r\nNature of Life\" and the \"Origin of All Things,\" which reach me, from time\r\nto time, might well be bound up with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tenth essay in this volume unfortunately brought me, I will not say\r\ninto collision, but into a position of critical remonstrance with regard\r\nto some charges of physical heterodoxy, brought by my distinguished\r\nfriend Lord Kelvin, against British Geology. As President of the\r\nGeological Society of London at that time (1869), I thought I might\r\nventure to plead that we were not such heretics as we seemed to be; and\r\nthat, even if we were, recantation would not affect the question of\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nI am glad to see that Lord Kelvin has just reprinted his reply to my\r\nplea,[1] and I refer the reader to it. I shall not presume to question\r\nanything, that on such ripe consideration, Lord Kelvin has to say upon\r\nthe physical problems involved. But I may remark that no one can have\r\nasserted more strongly than I have done, the necessity of looking to\r\nphysics and mathematics, for help in regard to the earliest history of\r\nthe globe. (See pp. 108 and 109 of this volume.)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Popular Lectures and Addresses._ II. Macmillan and Co.\r\n1894.]\r\n\r\nAnd I take the opportunity of repeating the opinion, that, whether what\r\nwe call geological time has the lower limit assigned to it by Lord\r\nKelvin, or the higher assumed by other philosophers; whether the germs of\r\nall living things have originated in the globe itself, or whether they\r\nhave been imported on, or in, meteorites from without, the problem of the\r\norigin of those successive Faunae and Florae of the earth, the existence of\r\nwhich is fully demonstrated by paleontology remains exactly where it was.\r\n\r\nFor I think it will be admitted, that the germs brought to us by\r\nmeteorites, if any, were not ova of elephants, nor of crocodiles; not\r\ncocoa-nuts nor acorns; not even eggs of shell-fish and corals; but only\r\nthose of the lowest forms of animal and vegetable life. Therefore, since\r\nit is proved that, from a very remote epoch of geological time, the earth\r\nhas been peopled by a continual succession of the higher forms of animals\r\nand plants, these either must have been created, or they have arisen by\r\nevolution. And in respect of certain groups of animals, the well-\r\nestablished facts of paleontology leave no rational doubt that they arose\r\nby the latter method.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, there are no data whatever, which justify the\r\nbiologist in assigning any, even approximately definite, period of time,\r\neither long or short, to the evolution of one species from another by the\r\nprocess of variation and selection. In the ninth of the following essays,\r\nI have taken pains to prove that the change of animals has gone on at\r\nvery different rates in different groups of living beings; that some\r\ntypes have persisted with little change from the paleozoic epoch till\r\nnow, while others have changed rapidly within the limits of an epoch. In\r\n1862 (see below p. 303, 304) in 1863 (vol. II., p. 461) and again in 1864\r\n(ibid., p. 89-91) I argued, not as a matter of speculation, but, from\r\npaleontological facts, the bearing of which I believe, up to that time,\r\nhad not been shown, that any adequate hypothesis of the causes of\r\nevolution must be consistent with progression, stationariness and\r\nretrogression, of the same type at different epochs; of different types\r\nin the same epoch; and that Darwin's hypothesis fulfilled these\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nAccording to that hypothesis, two factors are at work, variation and\r\nselection. Next to nothing is known of the causes of the former process;\r\nnothing whatever of the time required for the production of a certain\r\namount of deviation from the existing type. And, as respects selection,\r\nwhich operates by extinguishing all but a small minority of variations,\r\nwe have not the slightest means of estimating the rapidity with which it\r\ndoes its work. All that we are justified in saying is that the rate at\r\nwhich it takes place may vary almost indefinitely. If the famous paint-\r\nroot of Florida, which kills white pigs but not black ones, were abundant\r\nand certain in its action, black pigs might be substituted for white in\r\nthe course of two or three years. If, on the other hand, it was rare and\r\nuncertain in action, the white pigs might linger on for centuries.\r\n\r\nT.H.

Northward, the chalk may be\r\nfollowed as far as Yorkshire; on the south coast it appears abruptly in\r\nthe picturesque western bays of Dorset, and breaks into the Needles of\r\nthe Isle of Wight; while on the shores of Kent it supplies that long line\r\nof white cliffs to which England owes her name of Albion.\r\n\r\nWere the thin soil which covers it all washed away, a curved band of\r\nwhite chalk, here broader, and there narrower, might be followed\r\ndiagonally across England from Lulworth in Dorset, to Flamborough Head in\r\nYorkshire--a distance of over 280 miles as the crow flies. From this band\r\nto the North Sea, on the east, and the Channel, on the south, the chalk\r\nis largely hidden by other deposits; but, except in the Weald of Kent and\r\nSussex, it enters into the very foundation of all the south-eastern\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nAttaining, as it does in some places, a thickness of more than a thousand\r\nfeet, the English chalk must be admitted to be a mass of considerable\r\nmagnitude. Nevertheless, it covers but an insignificant portion of the\r\nwhole area occupied by the chalk formation of the globe, much of which\r\nhas the same general characters as ours, and is found in detached\r\npatches, some less, and others more extensive, than the English. Chalk\r\noccurs in north-west Ireland; it stretches over a large part of France,--\r\nthe chalk which underlies Paris being, in fact, a continuation of that of\r\nthe London basin; it runs through Denmark and Central Europe, and extends\r\nsouthward to North Africa; while eastward, it appears in the Crimea and\r\nin Syria, and may be traced as far as the shores of the Sea of Aral, in\r\nCentral Asia. If all the points at which true chalk occurs were\r\ncircumscribed, they would lie within an irregular oval about 3,000 miles\r\nin long diameter--the area of which would be as great as that of Europe,\r\nand would many times exceed that of the largest existing inland sea--the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThus the chalk is no unimportant element in the masonry of the earth's\r\ncrust, and it impresses a peculiar stamp, varying with the conditions to\r\nwhich it is exposed, on the scenery of the districts in which it occurs.\r\nThe undulating downs and rounded coombs, covered with sweet-grassed turf,\r\nof our inland chalk country, have a peacefully domestic and mutton-\r\nsuggesting prettiness, but can hardly be called either grand or\r\nbeautiful. But on our southern coasts, the wall-sided cliffs, many\r\nhundred feet high, with vast needles and pinnacles standing out in the\r\nsea, sharp and solitary enough to serve as perches for the wary\r\ncormorant, confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur upon the chalk\r\nheadlands. And, in the East, chalk has its share in the formation of some\r\nof the most venerable of mountain ranges, such as the Lebanon.\r\n\r\nWhat is this wide-spread component of the surface of the earth? and\r\nwhence did it come?\r\n\r\n\r\nYou may think this no very hopeful inquiry. You may not unnaturally\r\nsuppose that the attempt to solve such problems as these can lead to no\r\nresult, save that of entangling the inquirer in vague speculations,\r\nincapable of refutation and of verification. If such were really the\r\ncase, I should have selected some other subject than a \"piece of chalk\"\r\nfor my discourse. But, in truth, after much deliberation, I have been\r\nunable to think of any topic which would so well enable me to lead you to\r\nsee how solid is the foundation upon which some of the most startling\r\nconclusions of physical science rest.\r\n\r\nA great chapter of the history of the world is written in the chalk. Few\r\npassages in the history of man can be supported by such an overwhelming\r\nmass of direct and indirect evidence as that which testifies to the truth\r\nof the fragment of the history of the globe, which I hope to enable you\r\nto read, with your own eyes, to-night. Let me add, that few chapters of\r\nhuman history have a more profound significance for ourselves. I weigh my\r\nwords well when I assert, that the man who should know the true history\r\nof the bit of chalk which every carpenter carries about in his breeches-\r\npocket, though ignorant of all other history, is likely, if he will think\r\nhis knowledge out to its ultimate results, to have a truer, and therefore\r\na better, conception of this wonderful universe, and of man's relation to\r\nit, than the most learned student who is deep-read in the records of\r\nhumanity and ignorant of those of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe language of the chalk is not hard to learn, not nearly so hard as\r\nLatin, if you only want to get at the broad features of the story it has\r\nto tell; and I propose that we now set to work to spell that story out\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWe all know that if we \"burn\" chalk the result is quicklime. Chalk, in\r\nfact, is a compound of carbonic acid gas, and lime, and when you make it\r\nvery hot the carbonic acid flies away and the lime is left. By this\r\nmethod of procedure we see the lime, but we do not see the carbonic acid.\r\nIf, on the other hand, you were to powder a little chalk and drop it into\r\na good deal of strong vinegar, there would be a great bubbling and\r\nfizzing, and, finally, a clear liquid, in which no sign of chalk would\r\nappear. Here you see the carbonic acid in the bubbles; the lime,\r\ndissolved in the vinegar, vanishes from sight. There are a great many\r\nother ways of showing that chalk is essentially nothing but carbonic acid\r\nand quicklime. Chemists enunciate the result of all the experiments which\r\nprove this, by stating that chalk is almost wholly composed of \"carbonate\r\nof lime.\"\r\n\r\nIt is desirable for us to start from the knowledge of this fact, though\r\nit may not seem to help us very far towards what we seek. For carbonate\r\nof lime is a widely-spread substance, and is met with under very various\r\nconditions. All sorts of limestones are composed of more or less pure\r\ncarbonate of lime. The crust which is often deposited by waters which\r\nhave drained through limestone rocks, in the form of what are called\r\nstalagmites and stalactites, is carbonate of lime. Or, to take a more\r\nfamiliar example, the fur on the inside of a tea-kettle is carbonate of\r\nlime; and, for anything chemistry tells us to the contrary, the chalk\r\nmight be a kind of gigantic fur upon the bottom of the earth-kettle,\r\nwhich is kept pretty hot below.\r\n\r\nLet us try another method of making the chalk tell us its own history. To\r\nthe unassisted eye chalk looks simply like a very loose and open kind of\r\nstone. But it is possible to grind a slice of chalk down so thin that you\r\ncan see through it--until it is thin enough, in fact, to be examined with\r\nany magnifying power that may be thought desirable. A thin slice of the\r\nfur of a kettle might be made in the same way. If it were examined\r\nmicroscopically, it would show itself to be a more or less distinctly\r\nlaminated mineral substance, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nBut the slice of chalk presents a totally different appearance when\r\nplaced under the microscope. The general mass of it is made up of very\r\nminute granules; but, imbedded in this matrix, are innumerable bodies,\r\nsome smaller and some larger, but, on a rough average, not more than a\r\nhundredth of an inch in diameter, having a well-defined shape and\r\nstructure. A cubic inch of some specimens of chalk may contain hundreds\r\nof thousands of these bodies, compacted together with incalculable\r\nmillions of the granules.\r\n\r\nThe examination of a transparent slice gives a good notion of the manner\r\nin which the components of the chalk are arranged, and of their relative\r\nproportions. But, by rubbing up some chalk with a brush in water and then\r\npouring off the milky fluid, so as to obtain sediments of different\r\ndegrees of fineness, the granules and the minute rounded bodies may be\r\npretty well separated from one another, and submitted to microscopic\r\nexamination, either as opaque or as transparent objects. By combining the\r\nviews obtained in these various methods, each of the rounded bodies may\r\nbe proved to be a beautifully-constructed calcareous fabric, made up of a\r\nnumber of chambers, communicating freely with one another. The chambered\r\nbodies are of various forms. One of the commonest is something like a\r\nbadly-grown raspberry, being formed of a number of nearly globular\r\nchambers of different sizes congregated together. It is called\r\n_Globigerina_, and some specimens of chalk consist of little else than\r\n_Globigerinoe_ and granules. Let us fix our attention upon the\r\n_Globigerina_. It is the spoor of the game we are tracking. If we can\r\nlearn what it is and what are the conditions of its existence, we shall\r\nsee our way to the origin and past history of the chalk.\r\n\r\nA suggestion which may naturally enough present itself is, that these\r\ncurious bodies are the result of some process of aggregation which has\r\ntaken place in the carbonate of lime; that, just as in winter, the rime\r\non our windows simulates the most delicate and elegantly arborescent\r\nfoliage--proving that the mere mineral water may, under certain\r\nconditions, assume the outward form of organic bodies--so this mineral\r\nsubstance, carbonate of lime, hidden away in the bowels of the earth, has\r\ntaken the shape of these chambered bodies. I am not raising a merely\r\nfanciful and unreal objection. Very learned men, in former days, have\r\neven entertained the notion that all the formed things found in rocks are\r\nof this nature; and if no such conception is at present held to be\r\nadmissible, it is because long and varied experience has now shown that\r\nmineral matter never does assume the form and structure we find in\r\nfossils. If any one were to try to persuade you that an oyster-shell\r\n(which is also chiefly composed of carbonate of lime) had crystallized\r\nout of sea-water, I suppose you would laugh at the absurdity. Your\r\nlaughter would be justified by the fact that all experience tends to show\r\nthat oyster-shells are formed by the agency of oysters, and in no other\r\nway. And if there were no better reasons, we should be justified, on like\r\ngrounds, in believing that _Globigerina_ is not the product of anything\r\nbut vital activity.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, better evidence in proof of the organic nature of the\r\n_Globigerinoe_ than that of analogy is forthcoming. It so happens that\r\ncalcareous skeletons, exactly similar to the _Globigerinoe_ of the chalk,\r\nare being formed, at the present moment, by minute living creatures,\r\nwhich flourish in multitudes, literally more numerous than the sands of\r\nthe sea-shore, over a large extent of that part of the earth's surface\r\nwhich is covered by the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe history of the discovery of these living _Globigerinoe_, and of the\r\npart which they play in rock building, is singular enough. It is a\r\ndiscovery which, like others of no less scientific importance, has\r\narisen, incidentally, out of work devoted to very different and\r\nexceedingly practical interests. When men first took to the sea, they\r\nspeedily learned to look out for shoals and rocks; and the more the\r\nburthen of their ships increased, the more imperatively necessary it\r\nbecame for sailors to ascertain with precision the depth of the waters\r\nthey traversed. Out of this necessity grew the use of the lead and\r\nsounding line; and, ultimately, marine-surveying, which is the recording\r\nof the form of coasts and of the depth of the sea, as ascertained by the\r\nsounding-lead, upon charts.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it became desirable to ascertain and to indicate the\r\nnature of the sea-bottom, since this circumstance greatly affects its\r\ngoodness as holding ground for anchors. Some ingenious tar, whose name\r\ndeserves a better fate than the oblivion into which it has fallen,\r\nattained this object by \"arming\" the bottom of the lead with a lump of\r\ngrease, to which more or less of the sand or mud, or broken shells, as\r\nthe case might be, adhered, and was brought to the surface. But, however\r\nwell adapted such an apparatus might be for rough nautical purposes,\r\nscientific accuracy could not be expected from the armed lead, and to\r\nremedy its defects (especially when applied to sounding in great depths)\r\nLieut. Brooke, of the American Navy, some years ago invented a most\r\ningenious machine, by which a considerable portion of the superficial\r\nlayer of the sea-bottom can be scooped out and brought up from any depth\r\nto which the lead descends. In 1853, Lieut. Brooke obtained mud from the\r\nbottom of the North Atlantic, between Newfoundland and the Azores, at a\r\ndepth of more than 10,000 feet, or two miles, by the help of this\r\nsounding apparatus. The specimens were sent for examination to Ehrenberg\r\nof Berlin, and to Bailey of West Point, and those able microscopists\r\nfound that this deep-sea mud was almost entirely composed of the\r\nskeletons of living organisms--the greater proportion of these being just\r\nlike the _Globigerinoe_ already known to occur in the chalk.\r\n\r\nThus far, the work had been carried on simply in the interests of\r\nscience, but Lieut. Brooke's method of sounding acquired a high\r\ncommercial value, when the enterprise of laying down the telegraph-cable\r\nbetween this country and the United States was undertaken. For it became\r\na matter of immense importance to know, not only the depth of the sea\r\nover the whole line along which the cable was to be laid, but the exact\r\nnature of the bottom, so as to guard against chances of cutting or\r\nfraying the strands of that costly rope. The Admiralty consequently\r\nordered Captain Dayman, an old friend and shipmate of mine, to ascertain\r\nthe depth over the whole line of the cable, and to bring back specimens\r\nof the bottom. In former days, such a command as this might have sounded\r\nvery much like one of the impossible things which the young Prince in the\r\nFairy Tales is ordered to do before he can obtain the hand of the\r\nPrincess. However, in the months of June and July, 1857, my friend\r\nperformed the task assigned to him with great expedition and precision,\r\nwithout, so far as I know, having met with any reward of that kind. The\r\nspecimens or Atlantic mud which he procured were sent to me to be\r\nexamined and reported upon.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Appendix to Captain Dayman's _Deep-sea Soundings in the\r\nNorth Atlantic Ocean between Ireland and Newfoundland, made in H.M.S.\r\n\"Cyclops_.\" Published by order of the Lords Commissioners of the\r\nAdmiralty, 1858. They have since formed the subject of an elaborate\r\nMemoir by Messrs. Parker and Jones, published in the _Philosophical\r\nTransactions_ for 1865.]\r\n\r\nThe result of all these operations is, that we know the contours and the\r\nnature of the surface-soil covered by the North Atlantic for a distance\r\nof 1,700 miles from east to west, as well as we know that of any part of\r\nthe dry land. It is a prodigious plain--one of the widest and most even\r\nplains in the world. If the sea were drained off, you might drive a\r\nwaggon all the way from Valentia, on the west coast of Ireland, to\r\nTrinity Bay, in Newfoundland. And, except upon one sharp incline about\r\n200 miles from Valentia, I am not quite sure that it would even be\r\nnecessary to put the skid on, so gentle are the ascents and descents upon\r\nthat long route. From Valentia the road would lie down-hill for about 200\r\nmiles to the point at which the bottom is now covered by 1,700 fathoms of\r\nsea-water. Then would come the central plain, more than a thousand miles\r\nwide, the inequalities of the surface of which would be hardly\r\nperceptible, though the depth of water upon it now varies from 10,000 to\r\n15,000 feet; and there are places in which Mont Blanc might be sunk\r\nwithout showing its peak above water. Beyond this, the ascent on the\r\nAmerican side commences, and gradually leads, for about 300 miles, to the\r\nNewfoundland shore.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of the bottom of this central plain (which extends for\r\nmany hundred miles in a north and south direction) is covered by a fine\r\nmud, which, when brought to the surface, dries into a greyish white\r\nfriable substance. You can write with this on a blackboard, if you are so\r\ninclined; and, to the eye, it is quite like very soft, grayish chalk.\r\nExamined chemically, it proves to be composed almost wholly of carbonate\r\nof lime; and if you make a section of it, in the same way as that of the\r\npiece of chalk was made, and view it with the microscope, it presents\r\ninnumerable _Globigerinoe_ embedded in a granular matrix. Thus this deep-\r\nsea mud is substantially chalk. I say substantially, because there are a\r\ngood many minor differences; but as these have no bearing on the question\r\nimmediately before us,--which is the nature of the _Globigerinoe_ of the\r\nchalk,--it is unnecessary to speak of them.\r\n\r\n_Globigerinoe_ of every size, from the smallest to the largest, are\r\nassociated together in the Atlantic mud, and the chambers of many are\r\nfilled by a soft animal matter. This soft substance is, in fact, the\r\nremains of the creature to which the _Globigerinoe_ shell, or rather\r\nskeleton, owes its existence--and which is an animal of the simplest\r\nimaginable description. It is, in fact, a mere particle of living jelly,\r\nwithout defined parts of any kind--without a mouth, nerves, muscles, or\r\ndistinct organs, and only manifesting its vitality to ordinary\r\nobservation by thrusting out and retracting from all parts of its\r\nsurface, long filamentous processes, which serve for arms and legs. Yet\r\nthis amorphous particle, devoid of everything which, in the higher\r\nanimals, we call organs, is capable of feeding, growing, and multiplying;\r\nof separating from the ocean the small proportion of carbonate of lime\r\nwhich is dissolved in sea-water; and of building up that substance into a\r\nskeleton for itself, according to a pattern which can be imitated by no\r\nother known agency.\r\n\r\nThe notion that animals can live and flourish in the sea, at the vast\r\ndepths from which apparently living _Globigerinoe_; have been brought up,\r\ndoes not agree very well with our usual conceptions respecting the\r\nconditions of animal life; and it is not so absolutely impossible as it\r\nmight at first sight appear to be, that the _Globigcrinoe_ of the\r\nAtlantic sea-bottom do not live and die where they are found.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned, the soundings from the great Atlantic plain are\r\nalmost entirely made up of _Globigerinoe_, with the granules which have\r\nbeen mentioned, and some few other calcareous shells; but a small\r\npercentage of the chalky mud--perhaps at most some five per cent. of it--\r\nis of a different nature, and consists of shells and skeletons composed\r\nof silex, or pure flint. These silicious bodies belong partly to the\r\nlowly vegetable organisms which are called _Diatomaceoe_, and partly to\r\nthe minute, and extremely simple, animals, termed _Radiolaria_. It is\r\nquite certain that these creatures do not live at the bottom of the\r\nocean, but at its surface--where they may be obtained in prodigious\r\nnumbers by the use of a properly constructed net. Hence it follows that\r\nthese silicious organisms, though they are not heavier than the lightest\r\ndust, must have fallen, in some cases, through fifteen thousand feet of\r\nwater, before they reached their final resting-place on the ocean floor.\r\nAnd considering how large a surface these bodies expose in proportion to\r\ntheir weight, it is probable that they occupy a great length of time in\r\nmaking their burial journey from the surface of the Atlantic to the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nBut if the _Radiolaria_ and Diatoms are thus rained upon the bottom of\r\nthe sea, from the superficial layer of its waters in which they pass\r\ntheir lives, it is obviously possible that the _Globigerinoe_ may be\r\nsimilarly derived; and if they were so, it would be much more easy to\r\nunderstand how they obtain their supply of food than it is at present.\r\nNevertheless, the positive and negative evidence all points the other\r\nway. The skeletons of the full-grown, deep-sea _Globigerinoe_ are so\r\nremarkably solid and heavy in proportion to their surface as to seem\r\nlittle fitted for floating; and, as a matter of fact, they are not to be\r\nfound along with the Diatoms and _Radiolaria_ in the uppermost stratum of\r\nthe open ocean. It has been observed, again, that the abundance of\r\n_Globigerinoe_, in proportion to other organisms, of like kind, increases\r\nwith the depth of the sea; and that deep-water _Globigerinoe_ are larger\r\nthan those which live in shallower parts of the sea; and such facts\r\nnegative the supposition that these organisms have been swept by currents\r\nfrom the shallows into the deeps of the Atlantic. It therefore seems to\r\nbe hardly doubtful that these wonderful creatures live and die at the\r\ndepths in which they are found.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: During the cruise of H.M.S. _Bulldog_, commanded by Sir\r\nLeopold M'Clintock, in 1860, living star-fish were brought up, clinging\r\nto the lowest part of the sounding-line, from a depth of 1,260 fathoms,\r\nmidway between Cape Farewell, in Greenland, and the Rockall banks. Dr.\r\nWallich ascertained that the sea-bottom at this point consisted of the\r\nordinary _Globigerina_ ooze, and that the stomachs of the star-fishes\r\nwere full of _Globigerinoe_. This discovery removes all objections to the\r\nexistence of living _Globigerinoe_ at great depths, which are based upon\r\nthe supposed difficulty of maintaining animal life under such conditions;\r\nand it throws the burden of proof upon those who object to the\r\nsupposition that the _Globigerinoe_ live and die where they are found.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the important points for us are, that the living _Globigerinoe_\r\nare exclusively marine animals, the skeletons of which abound at the\r\nbottom of deep seas; and that there is not a shadow of reason for\r\nbelieving that the habits of the _Globigerinoe_ of the chalk differed\r\nfrom those of the existing species. But if this be true, there is no\r\nescaping the conclusion that the chalk itself is the dried mud of an\r\nancient deep sea.\r\n\r\nIn working over the soundings collected by Captain Dayman, I was\r\nsurprised to find that many of what I have called the \"granules\" of that\r\nmud were not, as one might have been tempted to think at first, the more\r\npowder and waste of _Globigerinoe_, but that they had a definite form and\r\nsize. I termed these bodies \"_coccoliths_,\" and doubted their organic\r\nnature. Dr. Wallich verified my observation, and added the interesting\r\ndiscovery that, not unfrequently, bodies similar to these \"coccoliths\"\r\nwere aggregated together into spheroids, which lie termed\r\n\"_coccospheres_.\" So far as we knew, these bodies, the nature of which is\r\nextremely puzzling and problematical, were peculiar to the Atlantic\r\nsoundings. But, a few years ago, Mr. Sorby, in making a careful\r\nexamination of the chalk by means of thin sections and otherwise,\r\nobserved, as Ehrenberg had done before him, that much of its granular\r\nbasis possesses a definite form. Comparing these formed particles with\r\nthose in the Atlantic soundings, he found the two to be identical; and\r\nthus proved that the chalk, like the surroundings, contains these\r\nmysterious coccoliths and coccospheres. Here was a further and most\r\ninteresting confirmation, from internal evidence, of the essential\r\nidentity of the chalk with modern deep-sea mud. _Globigerinoe_,\r\ncoccoliths, and coccospheres are found as the chief constituents of both,\r\nand testify to the general similarity of the conditions under which both\r\nhave been formed.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I have recently traced out the development of the\r\n\"coccoliths\" from a diameter of 1/7000th of an inch up to their largest\r\nsize (which is about 1/1000th), and no longer doubt that they are\r\nproduced by independent organisms, which, like the _Globigerinoe_, live\r\nand die at the bottom of the sea.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence furnished by the hewing, facing, and superposition of the\r\nstones of the Pyramids, that these structures were built by men, has no\r\ngreater weight than the evidence that the chalk was built by\r\n_Globigerinoe_; and the belief that those ancient pyramid-builders were\r\nterrestrial and air-breathing creatures like ourselves, is not better\r\nbased than the conviction that the chalk-makers lived in the sea. But as\r\nour belief in the building of the Pyramids by men is not only grounded on\r\nthe internal evidence afforded by these structures, but gathers strength\r\nfrom multitudinous collateral proofs, and is clinched by the total\r\nabsence of any reason for a contrary belief; so the evidence drawn from\r\nthe _Globigerinoe_ that the chalk is an ancient sea-bottom, is fortified\r\nby innumerable independent lines of evidence; and our belief in the truth\r\nof the conclusion to which all positive testimony tends, receives the\r\nlike negative justification from the fact that no other hypothesis has a\r\nshadow of foundation.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while briefly to consider a few of these collateral\r\nproofs that the chalk was deposited at the bottom of the sea. The great\r\nmass of the chalk is composed, as we have seen, of the skeletons of\r\n_Globigerinoe_, and other simple organisms, imbedded in granular matter.\r\nHere and there, however, this hardened mud of the ancient sea reveals the\r\nremains of higher animals which have lived and died, and left their hard\r\nparts in the mud, just as the oysters die and leave their shells behind\r\nthem, in the mud of the present seas.\r\n\r\nThere are, at the present day, certain groups of animals which are never\r\nfound in fresh waters, being unable to live anywhere but in the sea. Such\r\nare the corals; those corallines which are called _Polyzoa_; those\r\ncreatures which fabricate the lamp-shells, and are called _Brachiopoda_;\r\nthe pearly _Nautilus_, and all animals allied to it; and all the forms of\r\nsea-urchins and star-fishes. Not only are all these creatures confined to\r\nsalt water at the present day; but, so far as our records of the past go,\r\nthe conditions of their existence have been the same: hence, their\r\noccurrence in any deposit is as strong evidence as can be obtained, that\r\nthat deposit was formed in the sea. Now the remains of animals of all the\r\nkinds which have been enumerated, occur in the chalk, in greater or less\r\nabundance; while not one of those forms of shell-fish which are\r\ncharacteristic of fresh water has yet been observed in it.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that the remains of more than three thousand distinct\r\nspecies of aquatic animals have been discovered among the fossils of the\r\nchalk, that the great majority of them are of such forms as are now met\r\nwith only in the sea, and that there is no reason to believe that any one\r\nof them inhabited fresh water--the collateral evidence that the chalk\r\nrepresents an ancient sea-bottom acquires as great force as the proof\r\nderived from the nature of the chalk itself. I think you will now allow\r\nthat I did not overstate my case when I asserted that we have as strong\r\ngrounds for believing that all the vast area of dry land, at present\r\noccupied by the chalk, was once at the bottom of the sea, as we have for\r\nany matter of history whatever; while there is no justification for any\r\nother belief.\r\n\r\nNo less certain it is that the time during which the countries we now\r\ncall south-east England, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Egypt, Arabia,\r\nSyria, were more or less completely covered by a deep sea, was of\r\nconsiderable duration. We have already seen that the chalk is, in places,\r\nmore than a thousand feet thick. I think you will agree with me, that it\r\nmust have taken some time for the skeletons of animalcules of a hundredth\r\nof an inch in diameter to heap up such a mass as that. I have said that\r\nthroughout the thickness of the chalk the remains of other animals are\r\nscattered. These remains are often in the most exquisite state of\r\npreservation. The valves of the shell-fishes are commonly adherent; the\r\nlong spines of some of the sea-urchins, which would be detached by the\r\nsmallest jar, often remain in their places. In a word, it is certain that\r\nthese animals have lived and died when the place which they now occupy\r\nwas the surface of as much of the chalk as had then been deposited; and\r\nthat each has been covered up by the layer of _Globigerina_ mud, upon\r\nwhich the creatures imbedded a little higher up have, in like manner,\r\nlived and died. But some of these remains prove the existence of reptiles\r\nof vast size in the chalk sea. These lived their time, and had their\r\nancestors and descendants, which assuredly implies time, reptiles being\r\nof slow growth.\r\n\r\nThere is more curious evidence, again, that the process of covering up,\r\nor, in other words, the deposit of _Globigerina_ skeletons, did not go on\r\nvery fast. It is demonstrable that an animal of the cretaceous sea might\r\ndie, that its skeleton might lie uncovered upon the sea-bottom long\r\nenough to lose all its outward coverings and appendages by putrefaction;\r\nand that, after this had happened, another animal might attach itself to\r\nthe dead and naked skeleton, might grow to maturity, and might itself die\r\nbefore the calcareous mud had buried the whole.\r\n\r\nCases of this kind are admirably described by Sir Charles Lyell. He\r\nspeaks of the frequency with which geologists find in the chalk a\r\nfossilized sea-urchin, to which is attached the lower valve of a\r\n_Crania_. This is a kind of shell-fish, with a shell composed of two\r\npieces, of which, as in the oyster, one is fixed and the other free.\r\n\r\n\"The upper valve is almost invariably wanting, though occasionally found\r\nin a perfect state of preservation in the white chalk at some distance.\r\nIn this case, we see clearly that the sea-urchin first lived from youth\r\nto age, then died and lost its spines, which were carried away. Then the\r\nyoung _Crania_ adhered to the bared shell, grew and perished in its turn;\r\nafter which, the upper valve was separated from the lower, before the\r\nEchinus became enveloped in chalky mud.\"[4]\r\n\r\nA specimen in the Museum of Practical Geology, in London, still further\r\nprolongs the period which must have elapsed between the death of the sea-\r\nurchin, and its burial by the _Globigerinoe_. For the outward face of the\r\nvalve of a _Crania_, which is attached to a sea-urchin, (_Micraster_), is\r\nitself overrun by an incrusting coralline, which spreads thence over more\r\nor less of the surface of the sea-urchin. It follows that, after the\r\nupper valve of the _Crania_ fell off, the surface of the attached valve\r\nmust have remained exposed long enough to allow of the growth of the\r\nwhole coralline, since corallines do not live embedded in mud.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Elements of Geology_, by Sir Charles Lyell, Bart. F.B.S.,\r\np. 23.]\r\n\r\nThe progress of knowledge may, one day, enable us to deduce from such\r\nfacts as these the maximum rate at which the chalk can have accumulated,\r\nand thus to arrive at the minimum duration of the chalk period. Suppose\r\nthat the valve of the _Cronia_ upon which a coralline has fixed itself in\r\nthe way just described, is so attached to the sea-urchin that no part of\r\nit is more than an inch above the face upon which the sea-urchin rests.\r\nThen, as the coralline could not have fixed itself, if the _Crania_ had\r\nbeen covered up with chalk mud, and could not have lived had itself been\r\nso covered, it follows, that an inch of chalk mud could not have\r\naccumulated within the time between the death and decay of the soft parts\r\nof the sea-urchin and the growth of the coralline to the full size which\r\nit has attained. If the decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin; the\r\nattachment, growth to maturity, and decay of the _Crania_; and the\r\nsubsequent attachment and growth of the coralline, took a year (which is\r\na low estimate enough), the accumulation of the inch of chalk must have\r\ntaken more than a year: and the deposit of a thousand feet of chalk must,\r\nconsequently, have taken more than twelve thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of all this calculation is, of course, a knowledge of the\r\nlength of time the _Crania_ and the coralline needed to attain their full\r\nsize; and, on this head, precise knowledge is at present wanting. But\r\nthere are circumstances which tend to show, that nothing like an inch of\r\nchalk has accumulated during the life of a _Crania_; and, on any probable\r\nestimate of the length of that life, the chalk period must have had a\r\nmuch longer duration than that thus roughly assigned to it.\r\n\r\nThus, not only is it certain that the chalk is the mud of an ancient sea-\r\nbottom; but it is no less certain, that the chalk sea existed during an\r\nextremely long period, though we may not be prepared to give a precise\r\nestimate of the length of that period in years. The relative duration is\r\nclear, though the absolute duration may not be definable. The attempt to\r\naffix any precise date to the period at which the chalk sea began, or\r\nended, its existence, is baffled by difficulties of the same kind. But\r\nthe relative age of the cretaceous epoch may be determined with as great\r\nease and certainty as the long duration of that epoch.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard of the interesting discoveries recently made, in\r\nvarious parts of Western Europe, of flint implements, obviously worked\r\ninto shape by human hands, under circumstances which show conclusively\r\nthat man is a very ancient denizen of these regions. It has been proved\r\nthat the whole populations of Europe, whose existence has been revealed\r\nto us in this way, consisted of savages, such as the Esquimaux are now;\r\nthat, in the country which is now France, they hunted the reindeer, and\r\nwere familiar with the ways of the mammoth and the bison. The physical\r\ngeography of France was in those days different from what it is now--the\r\nriver Somme, for instance, having cut its bed a hundred feet deeper\r\nbetween that time and this; and, it is probable, that the climate was\r\nmore like that of Canada or Siberia, than that of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these people is forgotten even in the traditions of the\r\noldest historical nations. The name and fame of them had utterly vanished\r\nuntil a few years back; and the amount of physical change which has been\r\neffected since their day renders it more than probable that, venerable as\r\nare some of the historical nations, the workers of the chipped flints of\r\nHoxne or of Amiens are to them, as they are to us, in point of antiquity.\r\nBut, if we assign to these hoar relics of long-vanished generations of\r\nmen the greatest age that can possibly be claimed for them, they are not\r\nolder than the drift, or boulder clay, which, in comparison with the\r\nchalk, is but a very juvenile deposit. You need go no further than your\r\nown sea-board for evidence of this fact. At one of the most charming\r\nspots on the coast of Norfolk, Cromer, you will see the boulder clay\r\nforming a vast mass, which lies upon the chalk, and must consequently\r\nhave come into existence after it. Huge boulders of chalk are, in fact,\r\nincluded in the clay, and have evidently been brought to the position\r\nthey now occupy by the same agency as that which has planted blocks of\r\nsyenite from Norway side by side with them.\r\n\r\nThe chalk, then, is certainly older than the boulder clay. If you ask how\r\nmuch, I will again take you no further than the same spot upon your own\r\ncoasts for evidence. I have spoken of the boulder clay and drift as\r\nresting upon the chalk. That is not strictly true. Interposed between the\r\nchalk and the drift is a comparatively insignificant layer, containing\r\nvegetable matter. But that layer tells a wonderful history. It is full of\r\nstumps of trees standing as they grew. Fir-trees are there with their\r\ncones, and hazel-bushes with their nuts; there stand the stools of oak\r\nand yew trees, beeches and alders. Hence this stratum is appropriately\r\ncalled the \"forest-bed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the chalk must have been upheaved and converted into\r\ndry land, before the timber trees could grow upon it. As the bolls of\r\nsome of these trees are from two to three feet in diameter, it is no less\r\nclear that the dry land thus formed remained in the same condition for\r\nlong ages. And not only do the remains of stately oaks and well-grown\r\nfirs testify to the duration of this condition of things, but additional\r\nevidence to the same effect is afforded by the abundant remains of\r\nelephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, and other great wild beasts,\r\nwhich it has yielded to the zealous search of such men as the Rev. Mr.\r\nGunn. When you look at such a collection as he has formed, and bethink\r\nyou that these elephantine bones did veritably carry their owners about,\r\nand these great grinders crunch, in the dark woods of which the forest-\r\nbed is now the only trace, it is impossible not to feel that they are as\r\ngood evidence of the lapse of time as the annual rings of the tree\r\nstumps.\r\n\r\nThus there is a writing upon the wall of cliffs at Cromer, and whoso runs\r\nmay read it. It tells us, with an authority which cannot be impeached,\r\nthat the ancient sea-bed of the chalk sea was raised up, and remained dry\r\nland, until it was covered with forest, stocked with the great game the\r\nspoils of which have rejoiced your geologists. How long it remained in\r\nthat condition cannot be said; but \"the whirligig of time brought its\r\nrevenges\" in those days as in these. That dry land, with the bones and\r\nteeth of generations of long-lived elephants, hidden away among the\r\ngnarled roots and dry leaves of its ancient trees, sank gradually to the\r\nbottom of the icy sea, which covered it with huge masses of drift and\r\nboulder clay. Sea-beasts, such as the walrus, now restricted to the\r\nextreme north, paddled about where birds had twittered among the topmost\r\ntwigs of the fir-trees. How long this state of things endured we know\r\nnot, but at length it came to an end. The upheaved glacial mud hardened\r\ninto the soil of modern Norfolk. Forests grew once more, the wolf and the\r\nbeaver replaced the reindeer and the elephant; and at length what we call\r\nthe history of England dawned.\r\n\r\nThus you have, within the limits of your own county, proof that the chalk\r\ncan justly claim a very much greater antiquity than even the oldest\r\nphysical traces of mankind. But we may go further and demonstrate, by\r\nevidence of the same authority as that which testifies to the existence\r\nof the father of men, that the chalk is vastly older than Adam himself.\r\nThe Book of Genesis informs us that Adam, immediately upon his creation,\r\nand before the appearance of Eve, was placed in the Garden of Eden. The\r\nproblem of the geographical position of Eden has greatly vexed the\r\nspirits of the learned in such matters, but there is one point respecting\r\nwhich, so far as I know, no commentator has ever raised a doubt. This is,\r\nthat of the four rivers which are said to run out of it, Euphrates and\r\nHiddekel are identical with the rivers now known by the names of\r\nEuphrates and Tigris. But the whole country in which these mighty rivers\r\ntake their origin, and through which they run, is composed of rocks which\r\nare either of the same age as the chalk, or of later date. So that the\r\nchalk must not only have been formed, but, after its formation, the time\r\nrequired for the deposit of these later rocks, and for their upheaval\r\ninto dry land, must have elapsed, before the smallest brook which feeds\r\nthe swift stream of \"the great river, the river of Babylon,\" began to\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, evidence which cannot be rebutted, and which need not be\r\nstrengthened, though if time permitted I might indefinitely increase its\r\nquantity, compels you to believe that the earth, from the time of the\r\nchalk to the present day, has been the theatre of a series of changes as\r\nvast in their amount, as they were slow in their progress. The area on\r\nwhich we stand has been first sea and then land, for at least four\r\nalternations; and has remained in each of these conditions for a period\r\nof great length.\r\n\r\nNor have these wonderful metamorphoses of sea into land, and of land into\r\nsea, been confined to one corner of England. During the chalk period, or\r\n\"cretaceous epoch,\" not one of the present great physical features of the\r\nglobe was in existence. Our great mountain ranges, Pyrenees, Alps,\r\nHimalayas, Andes, have all been upheaved since the chalk was deposited,\r\nand the cretaceous sea flowed over the sites of Sinai and Ararat. All\r\nthis is certain, because rocks of cretaceous, or still later, date have\r\nshared in the elevatory movements which gave rise to these mountain\r\nchains; and may be found perched up, in some cases, many thousand feet\r\nhigh upon their flanks. And evidence of equal cogency demonstrates that,\r\nthough, in Norfolk, the forest-bed rests directly upon the chalk, yet it\r\ndoes so, not because the period at which the forest grew immediately\r\nfollowed that at which the chalk was formed, but because an immense lapse\r\nof time, represented elsewhere by thousands of feet of rock, is not\r\nindicated at Cromer.\r\n\r\nI must ask you to believe that there is no less conclusive proof that a\r\nstill more prolonged succession of similar changes occurred, before the\r\nchalk was deposited. Nor have we any reason to think that the first term\r\nin the series of these changes is known. The oldest sea-beds preserved to\r\nus are sands, and mud, and pebbles, the wear and tear of rocks which were\r\nformed in still older oceans.\r\n\r\nBut, great as is the magnitude of these physical changes of the world,\r\nthey have been accompanied by a no less striking series of modifications\r\nin its living inhabitants. All the great classes of animals, beasts of\r\nthe field, fowls of the air, creeping things, and things which dwell in\r\nthe waters, flourished upon the globe long ages before the chalk was\r\ndeposited. Very few, however, if any, of these ancient forms of animal\r\nlife were identical with those which now live. Certainly not one of the\r\nhigher animals was of the same species as any of those now in existence.\r\nThe beasts of the field, in the days before the chalk, were not our\r\nbeasts of the field, nor the fowls of the air such as those which the eye\r\nof men has seen flying, unless his antiquity dates infinitely further\r\nback than we at present surmise. If we could be carried back into those\r\ntimes, we should be as one suddenly set down in Australia before it was\r\ncolonized. We should see mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects,\r\nsnails, and the like, clearly recognizable as such, and yet not one of\r\nthem would be just the same as those with which we are familiar, and many\r\nwould be extremely different.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the present, the population of the world has undergone\r\nslow and gradual, but incessant, changes. There has been no grand\r\ncatastrophe--no destroyer has swept away the forms of life of one period,\r\nand replaced them by a totally new creation: but one species has vanished\r\nand another has taken its place; creatures of one type of structure have\r\ndiminished, those of another have increased, as time has passed on. And\r\nthus, while the differences between the living creatures of the time\r\nbefore the chalk and those of the present day appear startling, if placed\r\nside by side, we are led from one to the other by the most gradual\r\nprogress, if we follow the course of Nature through the whole series of\r\nthose relics of her operations which she has left behind. It is by the\r\npopulation of the chalk sea that the ancient and the modern inhabitants\r\nof the world are most completely connected. The groups which are dying\r\nout flourish, side by side, with the groups which are now the dominant\r\nforms of life. Thus the chalk contains remains of those strange flying\r\nand swimming reptiles, the pterodactyl, the ichthyosaurus, and the\r\nplesiosaurus, which are found in no later deposits, but abounded in\r\npreceding ages. The chambered shells called ammonites and belemnites,\r\nwhich are so characteristic of the period preceding the cretaceous, in\r\nlike manner die with it.\r\n\r\nBut, amongst these fading remainders of a previous state of things, are\r\nsome very modern forms of life, looking like Yankee pedlars among a tribe\r\nof Red Indians. Crocodiles of modern type appear; bony fishes, many of\r\nthem very similar to existing species, almost supplant the forms of fish\r\nwhich predominate in more ancient seas; and many kinds of living shell-\r\nfish first become known to us in the chalk. The vegetation acquires a\r\nmodern aspect. A few living animals are not even distinguishable as\r\nspecies, from those which existed at that remote epoch. The _Globigerina_\r\nof the present day, for example, is not different specifically from that\r\nof the chalk; and the same maybe said of many other _Foraminifera_. I\r\nthink it probable that critical and unprejudiced examination will show\r\nthat more than one species of much higher animals have had a similar\r\nlongevity; but the only example which I can at present give confidently\r\nis the snake's-head lampshell (_Terebratulina caput serpentis_), which\r\nlives in our English seas and abounded (as _Terebratulina striata_ of\r\nauthors) in the chalk.\r\n\r\nThe longest line of human ancestry must hide its diminished head before\r\nthe pedigree of this insignificant shell-fish. We Englishmen are proud to\r\nhave an ancestor who was present at the Battle of Hastings. The ancestors\r\nof _Terebratulina caput serpentis_ may have been present at a battle of\r\n_Ichthyosauria_ in that part of the sea which, when the chalk was\r\nforming, flowed over the site of Hastings. While all around has changed,\r\nthis _Terebratulina_ has peacefully propagated its species from\r\ngeneration to generation, and stands to this day, as a living testimony\r\nto the continuity of the present with the past history of the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to this moment I have stated, so far as I know, nothing but well-\r\nauthenticated facts, and the immediate conclusions which they force upon\r\nthe mind. But the mind is so constituted that it does not willingly rest\r\nin facts and immediate causes, but seeks always after a knowledge of the\r\nremoter links in the chain of causation.\r\n\r\nTaking the many changes of any given spot of the earth's surface, from\r\nsea to land and from land to sea, as an established fact, we cannot\r\nrefrain from asking ourselves how these changes have occurred. And when\r\nwe have explained them--as they must be explained--by the alternate slow\r\nmovements of elevation and depression which have affected the crust of\r\nthe earth, we go still further back, and ask, Why these movements?\r\n\r\nI am not certain that any one can give you a satisfactory answer to that\r\nquestion. Assuredly I cannot. All that can be said, for certain, is, that\r\nsuch movements are part of the ordinary course of nature, inasmuch as\r\nthey are going on at the present time. Direct proof may be given, that\r\nsome parts of the land of the northern hemisphere are at this moment\r\ninsensibly rising and others insensibly sinking; and there is indirect,\r\nbut perfectly satisfactory, proof, that an enormous area now covered by\r\nthe Pacific has been deepened thousands of feet, since the present\r\ninhabitants of that sea came into existence. Thus there is not a shadow\r\nof a reason for believing that the physical changes of the globe, in past\r\ntimes, have been effected by other than natural causes. Is there any more\r\nreason for believing that the concomitant modifications in the forms of\r\nthe living inhabitants of the globe have been brought about in other\r\nways?\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to answer this question, let us try to form a distinct\r\nmental picture of what has happened in some special case. The crocodiles\r\nare animals which, as a group, have a very vast antiquity. They abounded\r\nages before the chalk was deposited; they throng the rivers in warm\r\nclimates, at the present day. There is a difference in the form of the\r\njoints of the back-bone, and in some minor particulars, between the\r\ncrocodiles of the present epoch and those which lived before the chalk;\r\nbut, in the cretaceous epoch, as I have already mentioned, the crocodiles\r\nhad assumed the modern type of structure. Notwithstanding this, the\r\ncrocodiles of the chalk are not identically the same as those which lived\r\nin the times called \"older tertiary,\" which succeeded the cretaceous\r\nepoch; and the crocodiles of the older tertiaries are not identical with\r\nthose of the newer tertiaries, nor are these identical with existing\r\nforms. I leave open the question whether particular species may have\r\nlived on from epoch to epoch. But each epoch has had its peculiar\r\ncrocodiles; though all, since the chalk, have belonged to the modern\r\ntype, and differ simply in their proportions, and in such structural\r\nparticulars as are discernible only to trained eyes.\r\n\r\nHow is the existence of this long succession of different species of\r\ncrocodiles to be accounted for? Only two suppositions seem to be open to\r\nus--Either each species of crocodile has been specially created, or it\r\nhas arisen out of some pre-existing form by the operation of natural\r\ncauses. Choose your hypothesis; I have chosen mine. I can find no\r\nwarranty for believing in the distinct creation of a score of successive\r\nspecies of crocodiles in the course of countless ages of time. Science\r\ngives no countenance to such a wild fancy; nor can even the perverse\r\ningenuity of a commentator pretend to discover this sense, in the simple\r\nwords in which the writer of Genesis records the proceedings of the fifth\r\nand six days of the Creation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I see no good reason for doubting the necessary\r\nalternative, that all these varied species have been evolved from pre-\r\nexisting crocodilian forms, by the operation of causes as completely a\r\npart of the common order of nature as those which have effected the\r\nchanges of the inorganic world. Few will venture to affirm that the\r\nreasoning which applies to crocodiles loses its force among other\r\nanimals, or among plants. If one series of species has come into\r\nexistence by the operation of natural causes, it seems folly to deny that\r\nall may have arisen in the same way.\r\n\r\nA small beginning has led us to a great ending. If I were to put the bit\r\nof chalk with which we started into the hot but obscure flame of burning\r\nhydrogen, it would presently shine like the sun. It seems to me that this\r\nphysical metamorphosis is no false image of what has been the result of\r\nour subjecting it to a jet of fervent, though nowise brilliant, thought\r\nto-night. It has become luminous, and its clear rays, penetrating the\r\nabyss of the remote past, have brought within our ken some stages of the\r\nevolution of the earth. And in the shifting \"without haste, but without\r\nrest\" of the land and sea, as in the endless variation of the forms\r\nassumed by living beings, we have observed nothing but the natural\r\nproduct of the forces originally possessed by the substance of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEMS OF THE DEEP SEA\r\n\r\n[1873]\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of December, 1872, H.M.S. _Challenger_, an eighteen gun\r\ncorvette, of 2,000 tons burden, sailed from Portsmouth harbour for a\r\nthree, or perhaps four, years' cruise. No man-of-war ever left that\r\nfamous port before with so singular an equipment. Two of the eighteen\r\nsixty-eight pounders of the _Challenger's_ armament remained to enable\r\nher to speak with effect to sea-rovers, haply devoid of any respect for\r\nscience, in the remote seas for which she is bound; but the main-deck\r\nwas, for the most part, stripped of its war-like gear, and fitted up with\r\nphysical, chemical, and biological laboratories; Photography had its dark\r\ncabin; while apparatus for dredging, trawling, and sounding; for\r\nphotometers and for thermometers, filled the space formerly occupied by\r\nguns and gun-tackle, pistols and cutlasses.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the _Challenger_ match her fittings. Captain Nares, his\r\nofficers and men, are ready to look after the interests of hydrography,\r\nwork the ship, and, if need be, fight her as seamen should; while there\r\nis a staff of scientific civilians, under the general direction of Dr.\r\nWyville Thomson, F.R.S. (Professor of Natural History in Edinburgh\r\nUniversity by rights, but at present detached for duty _in partibus_),\r\nwhose business it is to turn all the wonderfully packed stores of\r\nappliances to account, and to accumulate, before the ship returns to\r\nEngland, such additions to natural knowledge as shall justify the labour\r\nand cost involved in the fitting out and maintenance of the expedition.\r\n\r\nUnder the able and zealous superintendence of the Hydrographer, Admiral\r\nRichards, every precaution which experience and forethought could devise\r\nhas been taken to provide the expedition with the material conditions of\r\nsuccess; and it would seem as if nothing short of wreck or pestilence,\r\nboth most improbable contingencies, could prevent the _Challenger_ from\r\ndoing splendid work, and opening up a new era in the history of\r\nscientific voyages.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch of this expedition is the culmination of a series of such\r\nenterprises, gradually increasing in magnitude and importance, which the\r\nAdmiralty, greatly to its credit, has carried out for some years past;\r\nand the history of which is given by Dr. Wyville Thomson in the\r\nbeautifully illustrated volume entitled \"The Depths of the Sea,\"\r\npublished since his departure.\r\n\r\n\"In the spring of the year 1868, my friend Dr. W.B. Carpenter, at that\r\ntime one of the Vice-Presidents of the Royal Society, was with me in\r\nIreland, where we were working out together the structure and development\r\nof the Crinoids. I had long previously had a profound conviction that the\r\nland of promise for the naturalist, the only remaining region where there\r\nwere endless novelties of extraordinary interest ready to the hand which\r\nhad the means of gathering them, was the bottom of the deep sea. I had\r\neven had a glimpse of some of these treasures, for I had seen, the year\r\nbefore, with Prof. Sars, the forms which I have already mentioned dredged\r\nby his son at a depth of 300 to 400 fathoms off the Loffoten Islands. I\r\npropounded my views to my fellow-labourer, and we discussed the subject\r\nmany times over our microscopes. I strongly urged Dr. Carpenter to use\r\nhis influence at head-quarters to induce the Admiralty, probably through\r\nthe Council of the Royal Society, to give us the use of a vessel properly\r\nfitted with dredging gear and all necessary scientific apparatus, that\r\nmany heavy questions as to the state of things in the depths of the\r\nocean, which were still in a state of uncertainty, might be definitely\r\nsettled. After full consideration, Dr. Carpenter promised his hearty co-\r\noperation, and we agreed that I should write to him on his return to\r\nLondon, indicating generally the results which I anticipated, and\r\nsketching out what I conceived to be a promising line of inquiry. The\r\nCouncil of the Royal Society warmly supported the proposal; and I give\r\nhere in chronological order the short and eminently satisfactory\r\ncorrespondence which led to the Admiralty placing at the disposal of Dr.\r\nCarpenter and myself the gunboat _Lightninq_, under the command of Staff-\r\nCommander May, R.N., in the summer of 1868, for a trial cruise to the\r\nNorth of Scotland, and afterwards to the much wider surveys in H.M.S.\r\n_Porcupine_, Captain Calver, R.N., which were made with the additional\r\nassociation of Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys, in the summers of the years 1869 and\r\n1870.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Depths of the Sea, pp. 49-50.]\r\n\r\nPlain men may be puzzled to understand why Dr. Wyville Thomson, not being\r\na cynic, should relegate the \"Land of Promise\" to the bottom of the deep\r\nsea, they may still more wonder what manner of \"milk and honey\" the\r\n_Challenger_ expects to find; and their perplexity may well rise to its\r\nmaximum, when they seek to divine the manner in which that milk and honey\r\nare to be got out of so inaccessible a Canaan. I will, therefore,\r\nendeavour to give some answer to these questions in an order the reverse\r\nof that in which I have stated them.\r\n\r\nApart from hooks, and lines, and ordinary nets, fishermen have, from time\r\nimmemorial, made use of two kinds of implements for getting at sea-\r\ncreatures which live beyond tide-marks--these are the \"dredge\" and the\r\n\"trawl.\" The dredge is used by oyster-fishermen. Imagine a large bag, the\r\nmouth of which has the shape of an elongated parallelogram, and is\r\nfastened to an iron frame of the same shape, the two long sides of this\r\nrim being fashioned into scrapers. Chains attach the ends of the frame to\r\na stout rope, so that when the bag is dragged along by the rope the edge\r\nof one of the scrapers rests on the ground, and scrapes whatever it\r\ntouches into the bag. The oyster-dredger takes one of these machines in\r\nhis boat, and when he has reached the oyster-bed the dredge is tossed\r\noverboard; as soon as it has sunk to the bottom the rope is paid out\r\nsufficiently to prevent it from pulling the dredge directly upwards, and\r\nis then made fast while the boat goes ahead. The dredge is thus dragged\r\nalong and scrapes oysters and other sea-animals and plants, stones, and\r\nmud into the bag. When the dredger judges it to be full he hauls it up,\r\npicks out the oysters, throws the rest overboard, and begins again.\r\n\r\nDredging in shallow water, say ten to twenty fathoms, is an easy\r\noperation enough; but the deeper the dredger goes, the heavier must be\r\nhis vessel, and the stouter his tackle, while the operation of hauling up\r\nbecomes more and more laborious. Dredging in 150 fathoms is very hard\r\nwork, if it has to be carried on by manual labour; but by the use of the\r\ndonkey-engine to supply power,[2] and of the contrivances known as\r\n\"accumulators,\" to diminish the risk of snapping the dredge rope by the\r\nrolling and pitching of the vessel, the dredge has been worked deeper and\r\ndeeper, until at last, on the 22nd of July, 1869, H.M.S. _Porcupine_\r\nbeing in the Bay of Biscay, Captain Calver, her commander, performed the\r\nunprecedented feat of dredging in 2,435 fathoms, or 14,610 feet, a depth\r\nnearly equal to the height of Mont Blanc. The dredge \"was rapidly hauled\r\non deck at one o'clock in the morning of the 23rd, after an absence of\r\n7-1/4 hours, and a journey of upwards of eight statute miles,\" with a\r\nhundred weight and a half of solid contents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The emotional side of the scientific nature has its\r\nsingularities. Many persons will call to mind a certain philosopher's\r\ntenderness over his watch--\"the little creature\"--which was so singularly\r\nlost and found again. But Dr. Wyville Thomson surpasses the owner of the\r\nwatch in his loving-kindness towards a donkey-engine. \"This little engine\r\nwas the comfort of our lives. Once or twice it was overstrained, and then\r\nwe pitied the willing little thing, panting like an overtaxed horse.\"]\r\n\r\nThe trawl is a sort of net for catching those fish which habitually live\r\nat the bottom of the sea, such as soles, plaice, turbot, and gurnett. The\r\nmouth of the net may be thirty or forty feet wide, and one edge of its\r\nmouth is fastened to a beam of wood of the same length. The two ends of\r\nthe beam are supported by curved pieces of iron, which raise the beam and\r\nthe edge of the net which is fastened to it, for a short distance, while\r\nthe other edge of the mouth of the net trails upon the ground. The closed\r\nend of the net has the form of a great pouch; and, as the beam is dragged\r\nalong, the fish, roused from the bottom by the sweeping of the net,\r\nreadily pass into its mouth and accumulate in the pouch at its end. After\r\ndrifting with the tide for six or seven hours the trawl is hauled up, the\r\nmarketable fish are picked out, the others thrown away, and the trawl\r\nsent overboard for another operation.\r\n\r\nMore than a thousand sail of well-found trawlers are constantly engaged\r\nin sweeping the seas around our coast in this way, and it is to them that\r\nwe owe a very large proportion of our supply of fish. The difficulty of\r\ntrawling, like that of dredging, rapidly increases with the depth at\r\nwhich the operation is performed; and, until the other day, it is\r\nprobable that trawling at so great a depth as 100 fathoms was something\r\nunheard of. But the first news from the _Challenger_ opens up new\r\npossibilities for the trawl.\r\n\r\nDr. Wyville Thomson writes (\"Nature,\" March 20, 1873):--\r\n\r\n\"For the first two or three hauls in very deep water off the coast of\r\nPortugal, the dredge came up filled with the usual 'Atlantic ooze,'\r\ntenacious and uniform throughout, and the work of hours, in sifting, gave\r\nthe very smallest possible result. We were extremely anxious to get some\r\nidea of the general character of the Fauna, and particularly of the\r\ndistribution of the higher groups; and after various suggestions for\r\nmodification of the dredge, it was proposed to try the ordinary trawl. We\r\nhad a compact trawl, with a 15-feet beam, on board, and we sent it down\r\noff Cape St. Vincent at a depth of 600 fathoms. The experiment looked\r\nhazardous, but, to our great satisfaction, the trawl came up all right\r\nand contained, with many of the larger invertebrate, several fishes....\r\nAfter the first attempt we tried the trawl several times at depths of\r\n1090, 1525, and, finally, 2125 fathoms, and always with success.\"\r\n\r\nTo the coral-fishers of the Mediterranean, who seek the precious red\r\ncoral, which grows firmly fixed to rocks at a depth of sixty to eighty\r\nfathoms, both the dredge and the trawl would be useless. They, therefore,\r\nhave recourse to a sort of frame, to which are fastened long bundles of\r\nloosely netted hempen cord, and which is lowered by a rope to the depth\r\nat which the hempen cords can sweep over the surface of the rocks and\r\nbreak off the coral, which is brought up entangled in the cords. A\r\nsimilar contrivance has arisen out of the necessities of deep-sea\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the dredging of the _Porcupine_, it was frequently found\r\nthat, while few objects of interest were brought up within the dredge,\r\nmany living creatures came up sticking to the outside of the dredge-bag,\r\nand even to the first few fathoms of the dredge-rope. The mouth of the\r\ndredge doubtless rapidly filled with mud, and thus the things it should\r\nhave brought up were shut out. To remedy this inconvenience Captain\r\nCalver devised an arrangement not unlike that employed by the coral-\r\nfishers. He fastened half a dozen swabs, such as are used for drying\r\ndecks, to the dredge. A swab is something like what a birch-broom would\r\nbe if its twigs were made of long, coarse, hempen yarns. These dragged\r\nalong after the dredge over the surface of the mud, and entangled the\r\ncreatures living there--multitudes of which, twisted up in the strands of\r\nthe swabs, were brought to the surface with the dredge. A further\r\nimprovement was made by attaching a long iron bar to the bottom of the\r\ndredge bag, and fastening large bunches of teased-out hemp to the end of\r\nthis bar. These \"tangles\" bring up immense quantities of such animals as\r\nhave long arms, or spines, or prominences which readily become caught in\r\nthe hemp, but they are very destructive to the fragile organisms which\r\nthey imprison; and, now that the trawl can be successfully worked at the\r\ngreatest depths, it may be expected to supersede them; at least, wherever\r\nthe ground is soft enough to permit of trawling.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that between the dredge, the trawl, and the tangles, there\r\nis little chance for any organism, except such as are able to burrow\r\nrapidly, to remain safely at the bottom of any part of the sea which the\r\n_Challenger_ undertakes to explore. And, for the first time in the\r\nhistory of scientific exploration, we have a fair chance of learning what\r\nthe population of the depths of the sea is like in the most widely\r\ndifferent parts of the world.\r\n\r\nAnd now arises the next question. The means of exploration being fairly\r\nadequate, what forms of life may be looked for at these vast depths?\r\n\r\nThe systematic study of the Distribution of living beings is the most\r\nmodern branch of Biological Science, and came into existence long after\r\nMorphology and Physiology had attained a considerable development. This\r\nnaturally does not imply that, from the time men began to observe natural\r\nphenomena, they were ignorant of the fact that the animals and plants of\r\none part of the world are different from those in other regions; or that\r\nthose of the hills are different from those of the plains in the same\r\nregion; or finally that some marine creatures are found only in the\r\nshallows, while others inhabit the deeps. Nevertheless, it was only after\r\nthe discovery of America that the attention of naturalists was powerfully\r\ndrawn to the wonderful differences between the animal population of the\r\ncentral and southern parts of the new world and that of those parts of\r\nthe old world which lie under the same parallels of latitude. So far back\r\nas 1667 Abraham Mylius, in his treatise \"De Animalium origine et\r\nmigratione, populorum,\" argues that, since there are innumerable species\r\nof animals in America which do not exist elsewhere, they must have been\r\nmade and placed there by the Deity: Buffon no less forcibly insists upon\r\nthe difference between the Faunae of the old and new world. But the first\r\nattempt to gather facts of this order into a whole, and to coordinate\r\nthem into a series of generalizations, or laws of Geographical\r\nDistribution, is not a century old, and is contained in the \"Specimen\r\nZoologiae Geographicae Quadrupedum Domicilia et Migrationes sistens,\"\r\npublished, in 1777, by the learned Brunswick Professor, Eberhard\r\nZimmermann, who illustrates his work by what he calls a \"Tabula\r\nZoographica,\" which is the oldest distributional map known to me.\r\n\r\nIn regard to matters of fact, Zimmermann's chief aim is to show that\r\namong terrestrial mammals, some occur all over the world, while others\r\nare restricted to particular areas of greater or smaller extent; and that\r\nthe abundance of species follows temperature, being greatest in warm and\r\nleast in cold climates. But marine animals, he thinks, obey no such law.\r\nThe Arctic and Atlantic seas, he says, are as full of fishes and other\r\nanimals as those of the tropics. It is, therefore, clear that cold does\r\nnot affect the dwellers in the sea as it does land animals, and that this\r\nmust be the case follows from the fact that sea water, \"propter varias\r\nquas continet bituminis spiritusque particulas,\" freezes with much more\r\ndifficulty than fresh water. On the other hand, the heat of the\r\nEquatorial sun penetrates but a short distance below the surface of the\r\nocean. Moreover, according to Zimmermann, the incessant disturbance of\r\nthe mass of the sea by winds and tides, so mixes up the warm and the cold\r\nthat life is evenly diffused and abundant throughout the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn 1810, Risso, in his work on the Ichthyology of Nice, laid the\r\nfoundation of what has since been termed \"bathymetrical\" distribution, or\r\ndistribution in depth, by showing that regions of the sea bottom of\r\ndifferent depths could be distinguished by the fishes which inhabit them.\r\nThere was the _littoral region_ between tide marks with its sand-eels,\r\npipe fishes, and blennies: the _seaweed region_, extending from low-\r\nwater-mark to a depth of 450 feet, with its wrasses, rays, and flat fish;\r\nand the _deep-sea region_, from 450 feet to 1500 feet or more, with\r\nits file-fish, sharks, gurnards, cod, and sword-fish.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty years later, M.M. Audouin and Milne Edwards carried out\r\nthe principle of distinguishing the Faunae of different zones of depth\r\nmuch more minutely, in their \"Recherches pour servir à l'Histoire\r\nNaturelle du Littoral de la France,\" published in 1832.\r\n\r\nThey divide the area included between highwater-mark and lowwater-mark of\r\nspring tides (which is very extensive, on account of the great rise and\r\nfall of the tide on the Normandy coast about St. Malo, where their\r\nobservations were made) into four zones, each characterized by its\r\npeculiar invertebrate inhabitants. Beyond the fourth region they\r\ndistinguish a fifth, which is never uncovered, and is inhabited by\r\noysters, scallops, and large starfishes and other animals. Beyond this\r\nthey seem to think that animal life is absent.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"Enfin plus has encore, c'est-à-dire alors loin des côtes,\r\nle fond des eaux ne paraît plus être habité, du moms dans nos mers, par\r\naucun de ces animaux\" (1. c. tom. i. p. 237). The \"ces animaux\" leaves\r\nthe meaning of the authors doubtful.]\r\n\r\nAudouin and Milne Edwards were the first to see the importance of the\r\nbearing of a knowledge of the manner in which marine animals are\r\ndistributed in depth, on geology. They suggest that, by this means, it\r\nwill be possible to judge whether a fossiliferous stratum was formed upon\r\nthe shore of an ancient sea, and even to determine whether it was\r\ndeposited in shallower or deeper water on that shore; the association of\r\nshells of animals which live in different zones of depth will prove that\r\nthe shells have been transported into the position in which they are\r\nfound; while, on the other hand, the absence of shells in a deposit will\r\nnot justify the conclusion that the waters in which it was formed were\r\ndevoid of animal inhabitants, inasmuch as they might have been only too\r\ndeep for habitation.\r\n\r\nThe new line of investigation thus opened by the French naturalists was\r\nfollowed up by the Norwegian, Sars, in 1835, by Edward Forbes, in our own\r\ncountry, in 1840,[4] and by Oersted, in Denmark, a few years later. The\r\ngenius of Forbes, combined with his extensive knowledge of botany,\r\ninvertebrate zoology, and geology, enabled him to do more than any of his\r\ncompeers, in bringing the importance of distribution in depth into\r\nnotice; and his researches in the Aegean Sea, and still more his\r\nremarkable paper \"On the Geological Relations of the existing Fauna and\r\nFlora of the British Isles,\" published in 1846, in the first volume of\r\nthe \"Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain,\" attracted\r\nuniversal attention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In the paper in the _Memoirs of the Survey_ cited further\r\non, Forbes writes:--\r\n\r\n\"In an essay 'On the Association of Mollusca on the British Coasts,\r\nconsidered with reference to Pleistocene Geology,' printed in [the\r\n_Edinburgh Academic Annual_ for] 1840, I described the mollusca, as\r\ndistributed on our shores and seas, in four great zones or regions,\r\nusually denominated 'The Littoral zone,' 'The region of Laminariae,' 'The\r\nregion of Coral-lines,' and 'The region of Corals.' An extensive series\r\nof researches, chiefly conducted by the members of the committee\r\nappointed by the British Association to investigate the marine geology of\r\nBritain by means of the dredge, have not invalidated this classification,\r\nand the researches of Professor Lovén, in the Norwegian and Lapland seas,\r\nhave borne out their correctness The first two of the regions above\r\nmentioned had been previously noticed by Lamoureux, in his account of the\r\ndistribution (vertically) of sea-weeds, by Audouin and Milne Edwards in\r\ntheir _Observations on the Natural History of the coast of France_, and\r\nby Sars in the preface to his _Beskrivelser og Jagttayelser_.\"]\r\n\r\nOn the coasts of the British Islands, Forbes distinguishes four zones or\r\nregions, the Littoral (between tide marks), the Laminarian (between\r\nlowwater-mark and 15 fathoms), the Coralline (from 15 to 50 fathoms), and\r\nthe Deep sea or Coral region (from 50 fathoms to beyond 100 fathoms).\r\nBut, in the deeper waters of the Aegean Sea, between the shore and a depth\r\nof 300 fathoms, Forbes was able to make out no fewer than eight zones of\r\nlife, in the course of which the number and variety of forms gradually\r\ndiminished until, beyond 300 fathoms, life disappeared altogether. Hence\r\nit appeared as if descent in the sea had much the same effect on life, as\r\nascent on land. Recent investigations appear to show that Forbes was\r\nright enough in his classification of the facts of distribution in depth\r\nas they are to be observed in the Aegean; and though, at the time he\r\nwrote, one or two observations were extant which might have warned him\r\nnot to generalize too extensively from his Aegean experience, his own\r\ndredging work was so much more extensive and systematic than that of any\r\nother naturalist, that it is not wonderful he should have felt justified\r\nin building upon it. Nevertheless, so far as the limit of the range of\r\nlife in depth goes, Forbes' conclusion has been completely negatived, and\r\nthe greatest depths yet attained show not even an approach to a \"zero of\r\nlife\":--\r\n\r\n\"During the several cruises of H.M. ships _Lightning_ and _Porcupine_ in\r\nthe years 1868, 1869, and 1870,\" says Dr. Wyville Thomson, \"fifty-seven\r\nhauls of the dredge were taken in the Atlantic at depths beyond 500\r\nfathoms, and sixteen at depths beyond 1,000 fathoms, and, in all cases,\r\nlife was abundant. In 1869, we took two casts in depths greater than\r\n2,000 fathoms. In both of these life was abundant; and with the deepest\r\ncast, 2,435 fathoms, off the month of the Bay of Biscay, we took living,\r\nwell-marked and characteristic examples of all the five invertebrate sub-\r\nkingdoms. And thus the question of the existence of abundant animal life\r\nat the bottom of the sea has been finally settled and for all depths, for\r\nthere is no reason to suppose that the depth anywhere exceeds between\r\nthree and four thousand fathoms; and if there be nothing in the\r\nconditions of a depth of 2,500 fathoms to prevent the full development of\r\na varied Fauna, it is impossible to suppose that even an additional\r\nthousand fathoms would make any great difference.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _The Depths of the Sea_, p. 30. Results of a similar kind,\r\nobtained by previous observers, are stated at length in the sixth\r\nchapter, pp. 267-280. The dredgings carried out by Count Pourtales, under\r\nthe authority of Professor Peirce, the Superintendent of the United\r\nStates Coast Survey, in the years 1867, 1868, and 1869, are particularly\r\nnoteworthy, and it is probably not too much to say, in the words of\r\nProfessor Agassiz, \"that we owe to the coast survey the first broad and\r\ncomprehensive basis for an exploration of the sea bottom on a large\r\nscale, opening a new era in zoological and geological research.\"]\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Wyville Thomson's recent letter, cited above, shows, the use of\r\nthe trawl, at great depths, has brought to light a still greater\r\ndiversity of life. Fishes came up from a depth of 600 to more than 1,000\r\nfathoms, all in a peculiar condition from the expansion of the air\r\ncontained in their bodies. On their relief from the extreme pressure,\r\ntheir eyes, especially, had a singular appearance, protruding like great\r\nglobes from their heads. Bivalve and univalve mollusca seem to be rare at\r\nthe greatest depths; but starfishes, sea urchins and other echinoderms,\r\nzoophytes, sponges, and protozoa abound.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the _Challenger_ has the privilege of opening a new\r\nchapter in the history of the living world. She cannot send down her\r\ndredges and her trawls into these virgin depths of the great ocean\r\nwithout bringing up a discovery. Even though the thing itself may be\r\nneither \"rich nor rare,\" the fact that it came from that depth, in that\r\nparticular latitude and longitude, will be a new fact in distribution,\r\nand, as such, have a certain importance.\r\n\r\nBut it may be confidently assumed that the things brought up will very\r\nfrequently be zoological novelties; or, better still, zoological\r\nantiquities, which, in the tranquil and little-changed depths of the\r\nocean, have escaped the causes of destruction at work in the shallows,\r\nand represent the predominant population of a past age.\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that Audouin and Milne Edwards foresaw the general\r\ninfluence of the study of distribution in depth upon the interpretation\r\nof geological phenomena. Forbes connected the two orders of inquiry still\r\nmore closely; and in the thoughtful essay \"On the connection between the\r\ndistribution of the existing Fauna and Flora of the British Isles, and\r\nthe geological changes which have affected their area, especially during\r\nthe epoch of the Northern drift,\" to which reference has already been\r\nmade, he put forth a most pregnant suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the sea bottom in the immediate vicinity of the\r\nBritish Islands, as in the Clyde district, among the Hebrides, in the\r\nMoray Firth, and in the German Ocean, there are depressed areas, forming a\r\nkind of submarine valleys, the centres of which are from 80 to 100\r\nfathoms, or more, deep. These depressions are inhabited by assemblages of\r\nmarine animals, which differ from those found over the adjacent and\r\nshallower region, and resemble those which are met with much farther\r\nnorth, on the Norwegian coast. Forbes called these Scandinavian\r\ndetachments \"Northern outliers.\"\r\n\r\nHow did these isolated patches of a northern population get into these\r\ndeep places? To explain the mystery, Forbes called to mind the fact that,\r\nin the epoch which immediately preceded the present, the climate was much\r\ncolder (whence the name of \"glacial epoch\" applied to it); and that the\r\nshells which are found fossil, or sub-fossil, in deposits of that age are\r\nprecisely such as are now to be met with only in the Scandinavian, or\r\nstill more Arctic, regions. Undoubtedly, during the glacial epoch, the\r\ngeneral population of our seas had, universally, the northern aspect\r\nwhich is now presented only by the \"northern outliers\"; just as the\r\nvegetation of the land, down to the sea-level, had the northern character\r\nwhich is, at present, exhibited only by the plants which live on the tops\r\nof our mountains. But, as the glacial epoch passed away, and the present\r\nclimatal conditions were developed, the northern plants were able to\r\nmaintain themselves only on the bleak heights, on which southern forms\r\ncould not compete with them. And, in like manner, Forbes suggested that,\r\nafter the glacial epoch, the northern animals then inhabiting the sea\r\nbecame restricted to the deeps in which they could hold their own against\r\ninvaders from the south, better fitted than they to flourish in the\r\nwarmer waters of the shallows. Thus depth in the sea corresponded in its\r\neffect upon distribution to height on the land.\r\n\r\nThe same idea is applied to the explanation of a similar anomaly in the\r\nFauna of the Aegean:--\r\n\r\n\"In the deepest of the regions of depth of the Aegean, the representation\r\nof a Northern Fauna is maintained, partly by identical and partly by\r\nrepresentative forms.... The presence of the latter is essentially due to\r\nthe law (of representation of parallels of latitude by zones of depth),\r\nwhilst that of the former species depended on their transmission from\r\ntheir parent seas during a former epoch, and subsequent isolation. That\r\nepoch was doubtless the newer Pliocene or Glacial Era, when the _Mya\r\ntruncata_ and other northern forms now extinct in the Mediterranean, and\r\nfound fossil in the Sicilian tertiaries, ranged into that sea. The\r\nchanges which there destroyed the _shallow water_ glacial forms, did not\r\naffect those living in the depths, and which still survive.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Memoirs of the Geological Survey of Great Britain_, Vol. i.\r\np. 390.]\r\n\r\nThe conception that the inhabitants of local depressions of the sea\r\nbottom might be a remnant of the ancient population of the area, which\r\nhad held their own in these deep fastnesses against an invading Fauna, as\r\nBritons and Gaels have held out in Wales and in Scotland against\r\nencroaching Teutons, thus broached by Forbes, received a wider\r\napplication than Forbes had dreamed of when the sounding machine first\r\nbrought up specimens of the mud of the deep sea. As I have pointed out\r\nelsewhere,[7] it at once became obvious that the calcareous sticky mud of\r\nthe Atlantic was made up, in the main, of shells of _Globigerina_ and\r\nother _Foraminifera_, identical with those of which the true chalk is\r\ncomposed, and the identity extended even to the presence of those\r\nsingular bodies, the Coccoliths and Coccospheres, the true nature of\r\nwhich is not yet made out. Here then were organisms, as old as the\r\ncretaceous epoch, still alive, and doing their work of rock-making at the\r\nbottom of existing seas. What if _Globigerina_ and the Coccoliths should\r\nnot be the only survivors of a world passed away, which are hidden\r\nbeneath three miles of salt water? The letter which Dr. Wyville Thomson\r\nwrote to Dr. Carpenter in May, 1868, out of which all these expeditions\r\nhave grown, shows that this query had become a practical problem in Dr.\r\nThomson's mind at that time; and the desirableness of solving the problem\r\nis put in the foreground of his reasons for urging the Government to\r\nundertake the work of exploration:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See above, \"On a Piece of Chalk,\" p. 13.]\r\n\r\n\"Two years ago, M. Sars, Swedish Government Inspector of Fisheries, had\r\nan opportunity, in his official capacity, of dredging off the Loffoten\r\nIslands at a depth of 300 fathoms. I visited Norway shortly after his\r\nreturn, and had an opportunity of studying with his father, Professor\r\nSars, some of his results. Animal forms were _abundant_; many of them\r\nwere new to science; and among them was one of surpassing interest, the\r\nsmall crinoid, of which you have a specimen, and which we at once\r\nrecognised as a degraded type of the _Apiocrinidoe_, an order hitherto\r\nregarded as extinct, which attained its maximum in the Pear Encrinites of\r\nthe Jurassic period, and whose latest representative hitherto known was\r\nthe _Bourguettocrinus_ of the chalk. Some years previously, Mr.\r\nAbsjornsen, dredging in 200 fathoms in the Hardangerfjord, procured\r\nseveral examples of a Starfish (_Brisinga_), which seems to find its\r\nnearest ally in the fossil genus _Protaster_. These observations place it\r\nbeyond a doubt that animal life is abundant in the ocean at depths\r\nvarying from 200 to 300 fathoms, that the forms at these great depths\r\ndiffer greatly from those met with in ordinary dredgings, and that, at\r\nall events in some cases, these animals are closely allied to, and would\r\nseem to be directly descended from, the Fauna of the early tertiaries.\r\n\r\n\"I think the latter result might almost have been anticipated; and,\r\nprobably, further investigation will largely add to this class of data,\r\nand will give us an opportunity of testing our determinations of the\r\nzoological position of some fossil types by an examination of the soft\r\nparts of their recent representatives. The main cause of the destruction,\r\nthe migration, and the extreme modification of animal types, appear to be\r\nchange of climate, chiefly depending upon oscillations of the earth's\r\ncrust. These oscillations do not appear to have ranged, in the Northern\r\nportion of the Northern Hemisphere, much beyond 1,000 feet since the\r\ncommencement of the Tertiary Epoch. The temperature of deep waters seems\r\nto be constant for all latitudes at 39°; so that an immense area of the\r\nNorth Atlantic must have had its conditions unaffected by tertiary or\r\npost-tertiary oscillations.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The Depths of the Sea, pp. 51-52.]\r\n\r\nAs we shall see, the assumption that the temperature of the deep sea is\r\neverywhere 39° F. (4° Cent.) is an error, which Dr. Wyville Thomson\r\nadopted from eminent physical writers; but the general justice of the\r\nreasoning is not affected by this circumstance, and Dr. Thomson's\r\nexpectation has been, to some extent, already verified.\r\n\r\nThus besides _Globigerina_, there are eighteen species of deep-sea\r\n_Foraminifera_ identical with species found in the chalk. Imbedded in the\r\nchalky mud of the deep sea, in many localities, are innumerable cup-\r\nshaped sponges, provided with six-rayed silicious spicula, so disposed\r\nthat the wall of the cup is formed of a lacework of flinty thread. Not\r\nless abundant, in some parts of the chalk formation, are the fossils\r\nknown as _Ventriculites_, well described by Dr. Thomson as \"elegant vases\r\nor cups, with branching root-like bases, or groups of regularly or\r\nirregularly spreading tubes delicately fretted on the surface with an\r\nimpressed network like the finest lace\"; and he adds, \"When we compare\r\nsuch recent forms as _Aphrocallistes, Iphiteon, Holtenia_, and\r\n_Askonema_, with certain series of the chalk _Ventriculites_, there\r\ncannot be the slightest doubt that they belong to the same family--in\r\nsome cases to very nearly allied genera.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _The Depths of the Sea_, p. 484.]\r\n\r\nProfessor Duncan finds \"several corals from the coast of Portugal more\r\nnearly allied to chalk forms than to any others.\"\r\n\r\nThe Stalked Crinoids or Feather Stars, so abundant in ancient times, are\r\nnow exclusively confined to the deep sea, and the late explorations have\r\nyielded forms of old affinity, the existence of which has hitherto been\r\nunsuspected. The general character of the group of star fishes imbedded\r\nin the white chalk is almost the same as in the modern Fauna of the deep\r\nAtlantic. The sea urchins of the deep sea, while none of them are\r\nspecifically identical with any chalk form, belong to the same general\r\ngroups, and some closely approach extinct cretaceous genera.\r\n\r\nTaking these facts in conjunction with the positive evidence of the\r\nexistence, during the Cretaceous epoch, of a deep ocean where now lies\r\nthe dry land of central and southern Europe, northern Africa, and western\r\nand southern Asia; and of the gradual diminution of this ocean during the\r\nolder tertiary epoch, until it is represented at the present day by such\r\nteacupfuls as the Caspian, the Black Sea, and the Mediterranean; the\r\nsupposition of Dr. Thomson and Dr. Carpenter that what is now the deep\r\nAtlantic, was the deep Atlantic (though merged in a vast easterly\r\nextension) in the Cretaceous epoch, and that the _Globigerina_ mud has\r\nbeen accumulating there from that time to this, seems to me to have a\r\ngreat degree of probability. And I agree with Dr. Wyville Thomson against\r\nSir Charles Lyell (it takes two of us to have any chance against his\r\nauthority) in demurring to the assertion that \"to talk of chalk having\r\nbeen uninterruptedly formed in the Atlantic is as inadmissible in a\r\ngeographical as in a geological sense.\"\r\n\r\nIf the word \"chalk\" is to be used as a stratigraphical term and\r\nrestricted to _Globigerina_ mud deposited during the Cretaceous epoch, of\r\ncourse it is improper to call the precisely similar mud of more recent\r\ndate, chalk. If, on the other hand, it is to be used as a mineralogical\r\nterm, I do not see how the modern and the ancient chalks are to be\r\nseparated--and, looking at the matter geographically, I see no reason to\r\ndoubt that a boring rod driven from the surface of the mud which forms\r\nthe floor of the mid-Atlantic would pass through one continuous mass of\r\n_Globigerina_ mud, first of modern, then of tertiary, and then of\r\nmesozoic date; the \"chalks\" of different depths and ages being\r\ndistinguished merely by the different forms of other organisms associated\r\nwith the _Globigerinoe_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think it must be admitted that a belief in the\r\ncontinuity of the modern with the ancient chalk has nothing to do with\r\nthe proposition that we can, in any sense whatever, be said to be still\r\nliving in the Cretaceous epoch. When the _Challenger's_ trawl brings up\r\nan _Ichthyosaurus_, along with a few living specimens of _Belemnites_ and\r\n_Turrilites_, it may be admitted that she has come upon a cretaceous\r\n\"outlier.\" A geological period is characterized not only by the presence\r\nof those creatures which lived in it, but by the absence of those which\r\nhave only come into existence later; and, however large a proportion of\r\ntrue cretaceous forms may be discovered in the deep sea, the modern types\r\nassociated with them must be abolished before the Fauna, as a whole,\r\ncould, with any propriety, be termed Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have now indicated some of the chief lines of Biological inquiry, in\r\nwhich the _Challenger_ has special opportunities for doing good service,\r\nand in following which she will be carrying out the work already\r\ncommenced by the _Lightning_ and _Porcupine_ in their cruises of 1868 and\r\nsubsequent years.\r\n\r\nBut biology, in the long run, rests upon physics, and the first condition\r\nfor arriving at a sound theory of distribution in the deep sea, is the\r\nprecise ascertainment of the conditions of life; or, in other words, a\r\nfull knowledge of all those phenomena which are embraced under the head\r\nof the Physical Geography of the Ocean.\r\n\r\nExcellent work has already been done in this direction, chiefly under the\r\nsuperintendence of Dr. Carpenter, by the _Lightning_ and the\r\n_Porcupine_,[10] and some data of fundamental importance to the physical\r\ngeography of the sea have been fixed beyond a doubt.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: _Proceedings of the Royal Society_, 1870 and 1872]\r\n\r\nThus, though it is true that sea-water steadily contracts as it cools\r\ndown to its freezing point, instead of expanding before it reaches its\r\nfreezing point as fresh water does, the truth has been steadily ignored\r\nby even the highest authorities in physical geography, and the erroneous\r\nconclusions deduced from their erroneous premises have been widely\r\naccepted as if they were ascertained facts. Of course, if sea-water, like\r\nfresh water, were heaviest at a temperature of 39° F. and got lighter as\r\nit approached 32° F., the water of the bottom of the deep sea could not\r\nbe colder than 39°. But one of the first results of the careful\r\nascertainment of the temperature at different depths, by means of\r\nthermometers specially contrived for the avoidance of the errors produced\r\nby pressure, was the proof that, below 1000 fathoms in the Atlantic, down\r\nto the greatest depths yet sounded, the water has a temperature always\r\nlower than 38° Fahr., whatever be the temperature of the water at the\r\nsurface. And that this low temperature of the deepest water is probably\r\nthe universal rule for the depths of the open ocean is shown, among\r\nothers, by Captain Chimmo's recent observations in the Indian ocean,\r\nbetween Ceylon and Sumatra, where, the surface water ranging from 85°-81°\r\nFahr., the temperature at the bottom, at a depth of 2270 to 2656 fathoms,\r\nwas only from 34° to 32° Fahr.\r\n\r\nAs the mean temperature of the superficial layer of the crust of the\r\nearth may be taken at about 50° Fahr., it follows that the bottom layer\r\nof the deep sea in temperate and hot latitudes, is, on the average, much\r\ncolder than either of the bodies with which it is in contact; for the\r\ntemperature of the earth is constant, while that of the air rarely falls\r\nso low as that of the bottom water in the latitudes in question; and even\r\nwhen it does, has time to affect only a comparatively thin stratum of the\r\nsurface water before the return of warm weather.\r\n\r\nHow does this apparently anomalous state of things come about? If we\r\nsuppose the globe to be covered with a universal ocean, it can hardly be\r\ndoubted that the cold of the regions towards the poles must tend to cause\r\nthe superficial water of those regions to contract and become\r\nspecifically heavier. Under these circumstances, it would have no\r\nalternative but to descend and spread over the sea bottom, while its\r\nplace would be taken by warmer water drawn from the adjacent regions.\r\nThus, deep, cold, polar-equatorial currents, and superficial, warmer,\r\nequatorial-polar currents, would be set up; and as the former would have\r\na less velocity of rotation from west to east than the regions towards\r\nwhich they travel, they would not be due southerly or northerly currents,\r\nbut south-westerly in the northern hemisphere, and north-westerly in the\r\nsouthern; while, by a parity of reasoning, the equatorial-polar warm\r\ncurrents would be north-easterly in the northern hemisphere, and south-\r\neasterly in the southern. Hence, as a north-easterly current has the same\r\ndirection as a south-westerly wind, the direction of the northern\r\nequatorial-polar current in the extra-tropical part of its course would\r\npretty nearly coincide with that of the anti-trade winds. The freezing of\r\nthe surface of the polar sea would not interfere with the movement thus\r\nset up. For, however bad a conductor of heat ice may be, the unfrozen\r\nsea-water immediately in contact with the undersurface of the ice must\r\nneeds be colder than that further off; and hence will constantly tend to\r\ndescend through the subjacent warmer water.\r\n\r\nIn this way, it would seem inevitable that the surface waters of the\r\nnorthern and southern frigid zones must, sooner or later, find their way\r\nto the bottom of the rest of the ocean; and there accumulate to a\r\nthickness dependent on the rate at which they absorb heat from the crust\r\nof the earth below, and from the surface water above.\r\n\r\nIf this hypothesis be correct, it follows that, if any part of the ocean\r\nin warm latitudes is shut off from the influence of the cold polar\r\nunderflow, the temperature of its deeps should be less cold than the\r\ntemperature of corresponding depths in the open sea. Now, in the\r\nMediterranean, Nature offers a remarkable experimental proof of just the\r\nkind needed. It is a landlocked sea which runs nearly east and west,\r\nbetween the twenty-ninth and forty-fifth parallels of north latitude.\r\nRoughly speaking, the average temperature of the air over it is 75° Fahr.\r\nin July and 48° in January.\r\n\r\nThis great expanse of water is divided by the peninsula of Italy\r\n(including Sicily), continuous with which is a submarine elevation\r\ncarrying less than 1,200 feet of water, which extends from Sicily to Cape\r\nBon in Africa, into two great pools--an eastern and a western. The\r\neastern pool rapidly deepens to more than 12,000 feet, and sends off to\r\nthe north its comparatively shallow branches, the Adriatic and the Aegean\r\nSeas. The western pool is less deep, though it reaches some 10,000 feet.\r\nAnd, just as the western end of the eastern pool communicates by a\r\nshallow passage, not a sixth of its greatest depth, with the western\r\npool, so the western pool is separated from the Atlantic by a ridge which\r\nruns between Capes Trafalgar and Spartel, on which there is hardly 1,000\r\nfeet of water. All the water of the Mediterranean which lies deeper than\r\nabout 150 fathoms, therefore, is shut off from that of the Atlantic, and\r\nthere is no communication between the cold layer of the Atlantic (below\r\n1,000 fathoms) and the Mediterranean. Under these circumstances, what is\r\nthe temperature of the Mediterranean? Everywhere below 600 feet it is\r\nabout 55° Fahr.; and consequently, at its greatest depths, it is some 20°\r\nwarmer than the corresponding depths of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt seems extremely difficult to account for this difference in any other\r\nway, than by adopting the views so strongly and ably advocated by Dr.\r\nCarpenter, that, in the existing distribution of land and water, such a\r\ncirculation of the water of the ocean does actually occur, as\r\ntheoretically must occur, in the universal ocean, with which we started.\r\n\r\nIt is quite another question, however, whether this theoretic\r\ncirculation, true cause as it may be, is competent to give rise to such\r\nmovements of sea-water, in mass, as those currents, which have commonly\r\nbeen regarded as northern extensions of the Gulf-stream. I shall not\r\nventure to touch upon this complicated problem; but I may take occasion\r\nto remark that the cause of a much simpler phenomenon--the stream of\r\nAtlantic water which sets through the Straits of Gibraltar, eastward, at\r\nthe rate of two or three miles an hour or more, does not seem to be so\r\nclearly made out as is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe facts appear to be that the water of the Mediterranean is very\r\nslightly denser than that of the Atlantic (1.0278 to 1.0265), and that\r\nthe deep water of the Mediterranean is slightly denser than that of the\r\nsurface; while the deep water of the Atlantic is, if anything, lighter\r\nthan that of the surface. Moreover, while a rapid superficial current is\r\nsetting in (always, save in exceptionally violent easterly winds) through\r\nthe Straits of Gibraltar, from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean, a deep\r\nundercurrent (together with variable side currents) is setting out\r\nthrough the Straits, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter adopts, without hesitation, the view that the cause of this\r\nindraught of Atlantic water is to be sought in the much more rapid\r\nevaporation which takes place from the surface of the Mediterranean than\r\nfrom that of the Atlantic; and thus, by lowering the level of the former,\r\ngives rise to an indraught from the latter.\r\n\r\nBut is there any sound foundation for the three assumptions involved\r\nhere? Firstly, that the evaporation from the Mediterranean, as a whole,\r\nis much greater than that from the Atlantic under corresponding\r\nparallels; secondly, that the rainfall over the Mediterranean makes up\r\nfor evaporation less than it does over the Atlantic; and thirdly,\r\nsupposing these two questions answered affirmatively: Are not these\r\nsources of loss in the Mediterranean fully covered by the prodigious\r\nquantity of fresh water which is poured into it by great rivers and\r\nsubmarine springs? Consider that the water of the Ebro, the Rhine, the\r\nPo, the Danube, the Don, the Dnieper, and the Nile, all flow directly or\r\nindirectly into the Mediterranean; that the volume of fresh water which\r\nthey pour into it is so enormous that fresh water may sometimes be baled\r\nup from the surface of the sea off the Delta of the Nile, while the land\r\nis not yet in sight; that the water of the Black Sea is half fresh, and\r\nthat a current of three or four miles an hour constantly streams from it\r\nMediterraneanwards through the Bosphorus;--consider, in addition, that no\r\nfewer than ten submarine springs of fresh water are known to burst up in\r\nthe Mediterranean, some of them so large that Admiral Smyth calls them\r\n\"subterranean rivers of amazing volume and force\"; and it would seem, on\r\nthe face of the matter, that the sun must have enough to do to keep the\r\nlevel of the Mediterranean down; and that, possibly, we may have to seek\r\nfor the cause of the small superiority in saline contents of the\r\nMediterranean water in some condition other than solar evaporation.\r\n\r\nAgain, if the Gibraltar indraught is the effect of evaporation, why does\r\nit go on in winter as well as in summer?\r\n\r\nAll these are questions more easily asked than answered; but they must be\r\nanswered before we can accept the Gibraltar stream as an example of a\r\ncurrent produced by indraught with any comfort.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean is not included in the _Challenger's_ route, but she\r\nwill visit one of the most promising and little explored of\r\nhydrographical regions--the North Pacific, between Polynesia and the\r\nAsiatic and American shores; and doubtless the store of observations upon\r\nthe currents of this region, which she will accumulate, when compared\r\nwith what we know of the North Atlantic, will throw a powerful light upon\r\nthe present obscurity of the Gulf-stream problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\n\r\nON SOME OF THE RESULTS OF THE EXPEDITION OF H.M.S. _CHALLLENGER_\r\n\r\n[1875]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1873, I drew attention[1] to the important problems connected\r\nwith the physics and natural history of the sea, to the solution of which\r\nthere was every reason to hope the cruise of H.M.S. _Challenger_ would\r\nfurnish important contributions. The expectation then expressed has not\r\nbeen disappointed. Reports to the Admiralty, papers communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society, and large collections which have already been sent home,\r\nhave shown that the _Challenger's_ staff have made admirable use of their\r\ngreat opportunities; and that, on the return of the expedition in 1874,\r\ntheir performance will be fully up to the level of their promise. Indeed,\r\nI am disposed to go so far as to say, that if nothing more came of the\r\n_Challengers_ expedition than has hitherto been yielded by her\r\nexploration of the nature of the sea bottom at great depths, a full\r\nscientific equivalent of the trouble and expense of her equipment would\r\nhave been obtained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the preceding Essay.]\r\n\r\nIn order to justify this assertion, and yet, at the same time, not to\r\nclaim more for Professor Wyville Thomson and his colleagues than is their\r\ndue, I must give a brief history of the observations which have preceded\r\ntheir exploration of this recondite field of research, and endeavour to\r\nmake clear what was the state of knowledge in December, 1872, and what\r\nnew facts have been added by the scientific staff of the _Challenger_. So\r\nfar as I have been able to discover, the first successful attempt to\r\nbring up from great depths more of the sea bottom than would adhere to a\r\nsounding-lead, was made by Sir John Ross, in the voyage to the Arctic\r\nregions which he undertook in 1818. In the Appendix to the narrative of\r\nthat voyage, there will be found an account of a very ingenious apparatus\r\ncalled \"clams\"--a sort of double scoop--of his own contrivance, which Sir\r\nJohn Ross had made by the ship's armourer; and by which, being in\r\nBaffin's Bay, in 72° 30' N. and 77° 15' W., he succeeded in bringing up\r\nfrom 1,050 fathoms (or 6,300 feet), \"several pounds\" of a \"fine green\r\nmud,\" which formed the bottom of the sea in this region. Captain (now Sir\r\nEdward) Sabine, who accompanied Sir John Ross on this cruise, says of\r\nthis mud that it was \"soft and greenish, and that the lead sunk several\r\nfeet into it.\" A similar \"fine green mud\" was found to compose the sea\r\nbottom in Davis Straits by Goodsir in 1845. Nothing is certainly known of\r\nthe exact nature of the mud thus obtained, but we shall see that the mud\r\nof the bottom of the Antarctic seas is described in curiously similar\r\nterms by Dr. Hooker, and there is no doubt as to the composition of this\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nIn 1850, Captain Penny collected in Assistance Bay, in Kingston Bay, and\r\nin Melville Bay, which lie between 73° 45' and 74° 40' N., specimens of\r\nthe residuum left by melted surface ice, and of the sea bottom in these\r\nlocalities. Dr. Dickie, of Aberdeen, sent these materials to Ehrenberg,\r\nwho made out[2] that the residuum of the melted ice consisted for the\r\nmost part of the silicious cases of diatomaceous plants, and of the\r\nsilicious spicula of sponges; while, mixed with these, were a certain\r\nnumber of the equally silicious skeletons of those low animal organisms,\r\nwhich were termed _Polycistineoe_ by Ehrenberg, but are now known as\r\n_Radiolaria_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ueber neue Anschauungen des kleinsten nördlichen\r\nPolarlebens_.--Monatsberichte d. K. Akad. Berlin, 1853.]\r\n\r\nIn 1856, a very remarkable addition to our knowledge of the nature of the\r\nsea bottom in high northern latitudes was made by Professor Bailey of\r\nWest Point. Lieutenant Brooke, of the United States Navy, who was\r\nemployed in surveying the Sea of Kamschatka, had succeeded in obtaining\r\nspecimens of the sea bottom from greater depths than any hitherto\r\nreached, namely from 2,700 fathoms (16,200 feet) in 56° 46' N., and 168°\r\n18' E.; and from 1,700 fathoms (10,200 feet) in 60° 15' N. and 170° 53'\r\nE. On examining these microscopically, Professor Bailey found, as\r\nEhrenberg had done in the case of mud obtained on the opposite side of\r\nthe Arctic region, that the fine mud was made up of shells of\r\n_Diatomacoe_, of spicula of sponges, and of _Radiolaria_, with a small\r\nadmixture of mineral matters, but without a trace of any calcareous\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nStill more complete information has been obtained concerning the nature\r\nof the sea bottom in the cold zone around the south pole. Between the\r\nyears 1839 and 1843, Sir James Clark Ross executed his famous Antarctic\r\nexpedition, in the course of which he penetrated, at two widely distant\r\npoints of the Antarctic zone, into the high latitudes of the shores of\r\nVictoria Land and of Graham's Land, and reached the parallel of 80° S.\r\nSir James Ross was himself a naturalist of no mean acquirements, and Dr.\r\nHooker,[3] the present President of the Royal Society, accompanied him as\r\nnaturalist to the expedition, so that the observations upon the fauna and\r\nflora of the Antarctic regions made during this cruise were sure to have\r\na peculiar value and importance, even had not the attention of the\r\nvoyagers been particularly directed to the importance of noting the\r\noccurrence of the minutest forms of animal and vegetable life in the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Now Sir Joseph Hooker. 1894.]\r\n\r\nAmong the scientific instructions for the voyage drawn up by a committee\r\nof the Royal Society, however, there is a remarkable letter from Von\r\nHumboldt to Lord Minto, then First Lord of the Admiralty, in which, among\r\nother things, he dwells upon the significance of the researches into the\r\nmicroscopic composition of rocks, and the discovery of the great share\r\nwhich microscopic organisms take in the formation of the crust of the\r\nearth at the present day, made by Ehrenberg in the years 1836-39.\r\nEhrenberg, in fact, had shown that the extensive beds of \"rotten-stone\"\r\nor \"Tripoli\" which occur in various parts of the world, and notably at\r\nBilin in Bohemia, consisted of accumulations of the silicious cases and\r\nskeletons of _Diatomaceoe_, sponges, and _Radiolaria_; he had proved that\r\nsimilar deposits were being formed by _Diatomaceoe_, in the pools of the\r\nThiergarten in Berlin and elsewhere, and had pointed out that, if it were\r\ncommercially worth while, rotten-stone might be manufactured by a process\r\nof diatom-culture. Observations conducted at Cuxhaven in 1839, had\r\nrevealed the existence, at the surface of the waters of the Baltic, of\r\nliving Diatoms and _Radiolaria_ of the same species as those which, in a\r\nfossil state, constitute extensive rocks of tertiary age at Caltanisetta,\r\nZante, and Oran, on the shores of the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in the fresh-water rotten-stone beds of Bilin, Ehrenberg had\r\ntraced out the metamorphosis, effected apparently by the action of\r\npercolating water, of the primitively loose and friable deposit of\r\norganized particles, in which the silex exists in the hydrated or soluble\r\ncondition. The silex, in fact, undergoes solution and slow redeposition,\r\nuntil, in ultimate result, the excessively fine-grained sand, each\r\nparticle of which is a skeleton, becomes converted into a dense opaline\r\nstone, with only here and there an indication of an organism.\r\n\r\nFrom the consideration of these facts, Ehrenberg, as early as the year\r\n1839, had arrived at the conclusion that rocks, altogether similar to\r\nthose which constitute a large part of the crust of the earth, must be\r\nforming, at the present day, at the bottom of the sea; and he threw out\r\nthe suggestion that even where no trace of organic structure is to be\r\nfound in the older rocks, it may have been lost by metamorphosis.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ueber die noch jetzt zahlreich lebende Thierarten der\r\nKreidebildung und den Organismus der Polythalamien. Abhandlungen der Kön.\r\nAkad. der Wissenchaften._ 1839. _Berlin_. 1841. I am afraid that this\r\nremarkable paper has been somewhat overlooked in the recent discussions\r\nof the relation of ancient rocks to modern deposits.]\r\n\r\nThe results of the Antarctic exploration, as stated by Dr. Hooker in the\r\n\"Botany of the Antarctic Voyage,\" and in a paper which he read before\r\nthe British Association in 1847, are of the greatest importance in\r\nconnection with these views, and they are so clearly stated in the former\r\nwork, which is somewhat inaccessible, that I make no apology for quoting\r\nthem at length--\r\n\r\n\"The waters and the ice of the South Polar Ocean were alike found to\r\nabound with microscopic vegetables belonging to the order _Diatomaceoe_.\r\nThough much too small to be discernible by the naked eye, they occurred\r\nin such countless myriads as to stain the berg and the pack ice wherever\r\nthey were washed by the swell of the sea; and, when enclosed in the\r\ncongealing surface of the water, they imparted to the brash and pancake\r\nice a pale ochreous colour. In the open ocean, northward of the frozen\r\nzone, this order, though no doubt almost universally present, generally\r\neludes the search of the naturalist; except when its species are\r\ncongregated amongst that mucous scum which is sometimes seen floating on\r\nthe waves, and of whose real nature we are ignorant; or when the coloured\r\ncontents of the marine animals who feed on these Algae are examined. To\r\nthe south, however, of the belt of ice which encircles the globe, between\r\nthe parallels of 50° and 70° S., and in the waters comprised between that\r\nbelt and the highest latitude ever attained by man, this vegetation is\r\nvery conspicuous, from the contrast between its colour and the white snow\r\nand ice in which it is imbedded. Insomuch, that in the eightieth degree,\r\nall the surface ice carried along by the currents, the sides of every\r\nberg and the base of the great Victoria Barrier itself, within reach of\r\nthe swell, were tinged brown, as if the polar waters were charged with\r\noxide of iron.\r\n\r\n\"As the majority of these plants consist of very simple vegetable cells,\r\nenclosed in indestructible silex (as other Algae are in carbonate of\r\nlime), it is obvious that the death and decomposition of such multitudes\r\nmust form sedimentary deposits, proportionate in their extent to the\r\nlength and exposure of the coast against which they are washed, in\r\nthickness to the power of such agents as the winds, currents, and sea,\r\nwhich sweep them more energetically to certain positions, and in purity,\r\nto the depth of the water and nature of the bottom. Hence we detected\r\ntheir remains along every icebound shore, in the depths of the adjacent\r\nocean, between 80 and 400 fathoms. Off Victoria Barrier (a perpendicular\r\nwall of ice between one and two hundred feet above the level of the sea)\r\nthe bottom of the ocean was covered with a stratum of pure white or green\r\nmud, composed principally of the silicious shells of the _Diatomaceoe_.\r\nThese, on being put into water, rendered it cloudy like milk, and took\r\nmany hours to subside. In the very deep water off Victoria and Graham's\r\nLand, this mud was particularly pure and fine; but towards the shallow\r\nshores there existed a greater or less admixture of disintegrated rock\r\nand sand; so that the organic compounds of the bottom frequently bore but\r\na small proportion to the inorganic.\" ...\r\n\r\n\"The universal existence of such an invisible vegetation as that of the\r\nAntarctic Ocean, is a truly wonderful fact, and the more from its not\r\nbeing accompanied by plants of a high order. During the years we spent\r\nthere, I had been accustomed to regard the phenomena of life as differing\r\ntotally from what obtains throughout all other latitudes, for everything\r\nliving appeared to be of animal origin. The ocean swarmed with\r\n_Mollusca_, and particularly entomostracous _Crustacea_, small whales,\r\nand porpoises; the sea abounded with penguins and seals, and the air with\r\nbirds; the animal kingdom was ever present, the larger creatures preying\r\non the smaller, and these again on smaller still; all seemed carnivorous.\r\nThe herbivorous were not recognised, because feeding on a microscopic\r\nherbage, of whose true nature I had formed an erroneous impression. It\r\nis, therefore, with no little satisfaction that I now class the\r\n_Diatomaceoe_ with plants, probably maintaining in the South Polar Ocean\r\nthat balance between the vegetable and the animal kingdoms which prevails\r\nover the surface of our globe. Nor is the sustenance and nutrition of the\r\nanimal kingdom the only function these minute productions may perform;\r\nthey may also be the purifiers of the vitiated atmosphere, and thus\r\nexecute in the Antarctic latitudes the office of our trees and grass turf\r\nin the temperate regions, and the broad leaves of the palm, &c., in the\r\ntropics.\" ...\r\n\r\nWith respect to the distribution of the _Diatomaceoe_, Dr. Hooker\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n\"There is probably no latitude between that of Spitzbergen and Victoria\r\nLand, where some of the species of either country do not exist: Iceland,\r\nBritain, the Mediterranean Sea, North and South America, and the South\r\nSea Islands, all possess Antarctic _Diatomaceoe_. The silicious coats of\r\nspecies only known living in the waters of the South Polar Ocean, have,\r\nduring past ages, contributed to the formation of rocks; and thus they\r\noutlive several successive creations of organized beings. The phonolite\r\nstones of the Rhine, and the Tripoli stone, contain species identical\r\nwith what are now contributing to form a sedimentary deposit (and\r\nperhaps, at some future period, a bed of rock) extending in one\r\ncontinuous stratum for 400 measured miles. I allude to the shores of the\r\nVictoria Barrier, along whose coast the soundings examined were\r\ninvariably charged with diatomaceous remains, constituting a bank which\r\nstretches 200 miles north from the base of Victoria Barrier, while the\r\naverage depth of water above it is 300 fathoms, or 1,800 feet. Again,\r\nsome of the Antarctic species have been detected floating in the\r\natmosphere which overhangs the wide ocean between Africa and America. The\r\nknowledge of this marvellous fact we owe to Mr. Darwin, who, when he was\r\nat sea off the Cape de Verd Islands, collected an impalpable powder which\r\nfell on Captain Fitzroy's ship. He transmitted this dust to Ehrenberg,\r\nwho ascertained it to consist of the silicious coats, chiefly of American\r\n_Diatomaceoe_, which were being wafted through the upper region of the\r\nair, when some meteorological phenomena checked them in their course and\r\ndeposited them on the ship and surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\n\"The existence of the remains of many species of this order (and amongst\r\nthem some Antarctic ones) in the volcanic ashes, pumice, and scoriae of\r\nactive and extinct volcanoes (those of the Mediterranean Sea and\r\nAscension Island, for instance) is a fact bearing immediately upon the\r\npresent subject. Mount Erebus, a volcano 12,400 feet high, of the first\r\nclass in dimensions and energetic action, rises at once from the ocean in\r\nthe seventy-eighth degree of south latitude, and abreast of the\r\n_Diatomaceoe_ bank, which reposes in part on its base. Hence it may not\r\nappear preposterous to conclude that, as Vesuvius receives the waters of\r\nthe Mediterranean, with its fish, to eject them by its crater, so the\r\nsubterranean and subaqueous forces which maintain Mount Erebus in\r\nactivity may occasionally receive organic matter from the bank, and\r\ndisgorge it, together with those volcanic products, ashes and pumice.\r\n\r\n\"Along the shores of Graham's Land and the South Shetland Islands, we\r\nhave a parallel combination of igneous and aqueous action, accompanied\r\nwith an equally copious supply of _Diatomaceoe_. In the Gulf of Erebus\r\nand Terror, fifteen degrees north of Victoria Land, and placed on the\r\nopposite side of the globe, the soundings were of a similar nature with\r\nthose of the Victoria Land and Barrier, and the sea and ice as full of\r\n_Diatomaceoe_. This was not only proved by the deep sea lead, but by the\r\nexamination of bergs which, once stranded, had floated off and become\r\nreversed, exposing an accumulation of white friable mud frozen to their\r\nbases, which abounded with these vegetable remains.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Challenger_ has explored the Antarctic seas in a region intermediate\r\nbetween those examined by Sir James Ross's expedition; and the\r\nobservations made by Dr. Wyville Thomson and his colleagues in every\r\nrespect confirm those of Dr. Hooker:--\r\n\r\n\"On the 11th of February, lat. 60° 52' S., long. 80° 20' E., and March 3,\r\nlat. 53° 55' S., long. 108° 35' E., the sounding instrument came up\r\nfilled with a very fine cream-coloured paste, which scarcely effervesced\r\nwith acid, and dried into a very light, impalpable, white powder. This,\r\nwhen examined under the microscope, was found to consist almost entirely\r\nof the frustules of Diatoms, some of them wonderfully perfect in all the\r\ndetails of their ornament, and many of them broken up. The species of\r\nDiatoms entering into this deposit have not yet been worked up, but they\r\nappear to be referable chiefly to the genera _Fragillaria, Coscinodiscus,\r\nChoetoceros, Asteromphalus_, and _Dictyocha_, with fragments of the\r\nseparated rods of a singular silicious organism, with which we were\r\nunacquainted, and which made up a large proportion of the finer matter of\r\nthis deposit. Mixed with the Diatoms there were a few small\r\n_Globigerinoe_, some of the tests and spicules of Radiolarians, and some\r\nsand particles; but these foreign bodies were in too small proportion to\r\naffect the formation as consisting practically of Diatoms alone. On the\r\n4th of February, in lat. 52°, 29' S., long., 71° 36\" E., a little to the\r\nnorth of the Heard Islands, the tow-net, dragging a few fathoms below the\r\nsurface, came up nearly filled with a pale yellow gelatinous mass. This\r\nwas found to consist entirely of Diatoms of the same species as those\r\nfound at the bottom. By far the most abundant was the little bundle of\r\nsilicious rods, fastened together loosely at one end, separating from one\r\nanother at the other end, and the whole bundle loosely twisted into a\r\nspindle. The rods are hollow, and contain the characteristic endochrome\r\nof the _Diatomaceoe_. Like the _Globigerina_ ooze, then, which it\r\nsucceeds to the southward in a band apparently of no great width, the\r\nmaterials of this silicious deposit are derived entirely from the surface\r\nand intermediate depths. It is somewhat singular that Diatoms did not\r\nappear to be in such large numbers on the surface over the Diatom ooze as\r\nthey were a little further north. This may perhaps be accounted for by\r\nour not having struck their belt of depth with the tow-net; or it is\r\npossible that when we found it on the 11th of February the bottom deposit\r\nwas really shifted a little to the south by the warm current, the\r\nexcessively fine flocculent _débris_ of the Diatoms taking a certain time\r\nto sink. The belt of Diatom ooze is certainly a little further to the\r\nsouthward in long. 83° E., in the path of the reflux of the Agulhas\r\ncurrent, than in long. 108° E.\r\n\r\n\"All along the edge of the ice-pack--everywhere, in fact, to the south of\r\nthe two stations--on the 11th of February on our southward voyage, and on\r\nthe 3rd of March on our return, we brought up fine sand and grayish mud,\r\nwith small pebbles of quartz and felspar, and small fragments of mica-\r\nslate, chlorite-slate, clay-slate, gneiss, and granite. This deposit, I\r\nhave no doubt, was derived from the surface like the others, but in this\r\ncase by the melting of icebergs and the precipitation of foreign matter\r\ncontained in the ice.\r\n\r\n\"We never saw any trace of gravel or sand, or any material necessarily\r\nderived from land, on an iceberg. Several showed vertical or irregular\r\nfissures filled with discoloured ice or snow; but, when looked at\r\nclosely, the discoloration proved usually to be very slight, and the\r\neffect at a distance was usually due to the foreign material filling the\r\nfissure reflecting light less perfectly than the general surface of the\r\nberg. I conceive that the upper surface of one of these great tabular\r\nsouthern icebergs, including by far the greater part of its bulk, and\r\nculminating in the portion exposed above the surface of the sea, was\r\nformed by the piling up of successive layers of snow during the period,\r\namounting perhaps to several centuries, during which the ice-cap was\r\nslowly forcing itself over the low land and out to sea over a long extent\r\nof gentle slope, until it reached a depth considerably above 200 fathoms,\r\nwhen the lower specific weight of the ice caused an upward strain which\r\nat length overcame the cohesion of the mass, and portions were rent off\r\nand floated away. If this be the true history of the formation of these\r\nicebergs, the absence of all land _débris_ in the portion exposed above\r\nthe surface of the sea is readily understood. If any such exist, it must\r\nbe confined to the lower part of the berg, to that part which has at one\r\ntime or other moved on the floor of the ice-cap.\r\n\r\n\"The icebergs, when they are first dispersed, float in from 200 to 250\r\nfathoms. When, therefore, they have been drifted to latitudes of 65° or\r\n64° S., the bottom of the berg just reaches the layer at which the\r\ntemperature of the water is distinctly rising, and it is rapidly melted,\r\nand the mud and pebbles with which it is more or less charged are\r\nprecipitated. That this precipitation takes place all over the area where\r\nthe icebergs are breaking up, constantly, and to a considerable extent,\r\nis evident from the fact of the soundings being entirely composed of such\r\ndeposits; for the Diatoms, _Globigerinoe_, and radiolarians are present\r\non the surface in large numbers; and unless the deposit from the ice were\r\nabundant it would soon be covered and masked by a layer of the exuvia of\r\nsurface organisms.\"\r\n\r\nThe observations which have been detailed leave no doubt that the\r\nAntarctic sea bottom, from a little to the south of the fiftieth\r\nparallel, as far as 80° S., is being covered by a fine deposit of\r\nsilicious mud, more or less mixed, in some parts, with the ice-borne\r\n_débris_ of polar lands and with the ejections of volcanoes. The\r\nsilicious particles which constitute this mud, are derived, in part, from\r\nthe diatomaceous plants and radiolarian animals which throng the surface,\r\nand, in part, from the spicula of sponges which live at the bottom. The\r\nevidence respecting the corresponding Arctic area is less complete, but\r\nit is sufficient to justify the conclusion that an essentially similar\r\nsilicious cap is being formed around the northern pole.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the constituent particles of this mud may\r\nagglomerate into a dense rock, such as that formed at Oran on the shores\r\nof the Mediterranean, which is made up of similar materials. Moreover, in\r\nthe case of freshwater deposits of this kind it is certain that the\r\naction of percolating water may convert the originally soft and friable,\r\nfine-grained sandstone into a dense, semi-transparent opaline stone, the\r\nsilicious organized skeletons being dissolved, and the silex re-deposited\r\nin an amorphous state. Whether such a metamorphosis as this occurs in\r\nsubmarine deposits, as well as in those formed in fresh water, does not\r\nappear; but there seems no reason to doubt that it may. And hence it may\r\nnot be hazardous to conclude that very ordinary metamorphic agencies may\r\nconvert these polar caps into a form of quartzite.\r\n\r\nIn the great intermediate zone, occupying some 110° of latitude, which\r\nseparates the circumpolar Arctic and Antarctic areas of silicious\r\ndeposit, the Diatoms and _Radiolaria_ of the surface water and the\r\nsponges of the bottom do not die out, and, so far as some forms are\r\nconcerned, do not even appear to diminish in total number; though, on a\r\nrough estimate, it would appear that the proportion of _Radiolaria_ to\r\nDiatoms is much greater than in the colder seas. Nevertheless the\r\ncomposition of the deep-sea mud of this intermediate zone is entirely\r\ndifferent from that of the circumpolar regions.\r\n\r\nThe first exact information respecting the nature of this mud at depths\r\ngreater than 1,000 fathoms was given by Ehrenberg, in the account which\r\nhe published in the \"Monatsberichte\" of the Berlin Academy for the year\r\n1853, of the soundings obtained by Lieut. Berryman, of the United States\r\nNavy, in the North Atlantic, between Newfoundland and the Azores.\r\n\r\nObservations which confirm those of Ehrenberg in all essential respects\r\nhave been made by Professor Bailey, myself, Dr. Wallich, Dr. Carpenter,\r\nand Professor Wyville Thomson, in their earlier cruises; and the\r\ncontinuation of the _Globigerina_ ooze over the South Pacific has been\r\nproved by the recent work of the _Challenger_, by which it is also shown,\r\nfor the first time, that, in passing from the equator to high southern\r\nlatitudes, the number and variety of the _Foraminifera_ diminishes, and\r\neven the _Globigerinoe_ become dwarfed. And this result, it will be\r\nobserved, is in entire accordance with the fact already mentioned that,\r\nin the sea of Kamschatka, the deep-sea mud was found by Bailey to contain\r\nno calcareous organisms.\r\n\r\nThus, in the whole of the \"intermediate zone,\" the silicious deposit\r\nwhich is being formed there, as elsewhere, by the accumulation of sponge-\r\nspicula, _Radiolaria_, and Diatoms, is obscured and overpowered by the\r\nimmensely greater amount of calcareous sediment, which arises from the\r\naggregation of the skeletons of dead _Foraminifera_. The similarity of\r\nthe deposit, thus composed of a large percentage of carbonate of lime,\r\nand a small percentage of silex, to chalk, regarded merely as a kind of\r\nrock, which was first pointed out by Ehrenberg,[5] is now admitted on all\r\nhands; nor can it be reasonably doubted, that ordinary metamorphic\r\nagencies are competent to convert the \"modern chalk\" into hard limestone\r\nor even into crystalline marble.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The following passages in Ehrenberg's memoir on _The\r\nOrganisms in the Chalk which are still living_ (1839), are conclusive:--\r\n\r\n\"7. The dawning period of the existing living organic creation, if such a\r\nperiod is distinguishable (which is doubtful), can only be supposed to\r\nhave existed on the other side of, and below, the chalk formation; and\r\nthus, either the chalk, with its widespread and thick beds, must enter\r\ninto the series of newer formations; or some of the accepted four great\r\ngeological periods, the quaternary, tertiary, and secondary formations,\r\ncontain organisms which still live. It is more probable, in the\r\nproportion of 3 to 1, that the transition or primary period is not\r\ndifferent, but that it is only more difficult to examine and understand,\r\nby reason of the gradual and prolonged chemical decomposition and\r\nmetamorphosis of many of its organic constituents.\"\r\n\r\n\"10. By the mass-forming _Infasoria_ and _Polythalamia_, secondary are\r\nnot distinguishable from tertiary formations; and, from what has been\r\nsaid, it is possible that, at this very day, rock masses are forming in\r\nthe sea, and being raised by volcanic agencies, the constitution of\r\nwhich, on the whole, is altogether similar to that of the chalk. The\r\nchalk remains distinguishable by its organic remains as a formation, but\r\nnot as a kind of rock.\"]\r\n\r\nEhrenberg appears to have taken it for granted that the _Globigerinoe_\r\nand other _Foraminifera_ which are found in the deep-sea mud, live at the\r\ngreat depths in which their remains are found; and he supports this\r\nopinion by producing evidence that the soft parts of these organisms are\r\npreserved, and may be demonstrated by removing the calcareous matter with\r\ndilute acids. In 1857, the evidence for and against this conclusion\r\nappeared to me to be insufficient to warrant a positive conclusion one\r\nway or the other, and I expressed myself in my report to the Admiralty on\r\nCaptain Dayman's soundings in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"When we consider the immense area over which this deposit is spread, the\r\ndepth at which its formation is going on, and its similarity to chalk,\r\nand still more to such rocks as the marls of Caltanisetta, the question,\r\nwhence are all these organisms derived? becomes one of high scientific\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"Three answers have suggested themselves:--\r\n\r\n\"In accordance with the prevalent view of the limitation of life to\r\ncomparatively small depths, it is imagined either: 1, that these\r\norganisms have drifted into their present position from shallower waters;\r\nor 2, that they habitually live at the surface of the ocean, and only\r\nfall down into their present position.\r\n\r\n\"1. I conceive that the first supposition is negatived by the extremely\r\nmarked zoological peculiarity of the deep-sea fauna.\r\n\r\n\"Had the _Globigerinoe_ been drifted into their present position from\r\nshallow water, we should find a very large proportion of the\r\ncharacteristic inhabitants of shallow waters mixed with them, and this\r\nwould the more certainly be the case, as the large _Globigerinoe_, so\r\nabundant in the deep-sea soundings, are, in proportion to their size,\r\nmore solid and massive than almost any other _Foraminifera_. But the fact\r\nis that the proportion of other _Foraminifera_ is exceedingly small, nor\r\nhave I found as yet, in the deep-sea deposits, any such matters as\r\nfragments of molluscous shells, of _Echini_, &c., which abound in shallow\r\nwaters, and are quite as likely to be drifted as the heavy\r\n_Globigerinoe_. Again, the relative proportions of young and fully formed\r\n_Globigerinoe_ seem inconsistent with the notion that they have travelled\r\nfar. And it seems difficult to imagine why, had the deposit been\r\naccumulated in this way, _Coscinodisci_ should so almost entirely\r\nrepresent the _Diatomaceoe_.\r\n\r\n\"2. The second hypothesis is far more feasible, and is strongly supported\r\nby the fact that many _Polycistineoe [Radiolaria]_ and _Coscinodisci_ are\r\nwell known to live at the surface of the ocean. Mr. Macdonald, Assistant-\r\nSurgeon of H.M.S. _Herald_, now in the South-Western Pacific, has lately\r\nsent home some very valuable observations on living forms of this kind,\r\nmet with in the stomachs of oceanic mollusks, and therefore certainly\r\ninhabitants of the superficial layer of the ocean. But it is a singular\r\ncircumstance that only one of the forms figured by Mr. Macdonald is at\r\nall like a _Globigerina_, and there are some peculiarities about even\r\nthis which make me greatly doubt its affinity with that genus. The form,\r\nindeed, is not unlike that of a _Globigerina_, but it is provided with\r\nlong radiating processes, of which I have never seen any trace in\r\n_Globigerina_. Did they exist, they might explain what otherwise is a\r\ngreat objection to this view, viz., how is it conceivable that the heavy\r\n_Globigerina_ should maintain itself at the surface of the water?\r\n\r\n\"If the organic bodies in the deep-sea soundings have neither been\r\ndrifted, nor have fallen from above, there remains but one alternative--\r\nthey must have lived and died where they are.\r\n\r\n\"Important objections, however, at once suggest themselves to this view.\r\nHow can animal life be conceived to exist under such conditions of light,\r\ntemperature, pressure, and aeration as must obtain at these vast depths?\r\n\r\n\"To this one can only reply that we know for a certainty that even very\r\nhighly-organized animals do continue to live at a depth of 300 and 400\r\nfathoms, inasmuch as they have been dredged up thence; and that the\r\ndifference in the amount of light and heat at 400 and at 2,000 fathoms is\r\nprobably, so to speak, very far less than the difference in complexity of\r\norganisation between these animals and the humbler _Protozoa_ and\r\n_Protophyta_ of the deep-sea soundings.\r\n\r\n\"I confess, though as yet far from regarding it proved that the\r\n_Globigerinoe_ live at these depths, the balance of probabilities seems\r\nto me to incline in that direction. And there is one circumstance which\r\nweighs strongly in my mind. It may be taken as a law that any genus of\r\nanimals which is found far back in time is capable of living under a\r\ngreat variety of circumstances as regards light, temperature, and\r\npressure. Now, the genus _Globigerina_ is abundantly represented in the\r\ncretaceous epoch, and perhaps earlier.\r\n\r\n\"I abstain, however, at present from drawing any positive conclusions,\r\npreferring rather to await the result of more extended observations.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Appendix to Report on Deep-sea Soundings in the Atlantic\r\nOcean, by Lieut.-Commander Joseph Dayman. 1857.]\r\n\r\nDr. Wallich, Professor Wyville Thomson, and Dr. Carpenter concluded that\r\nthe _Globigerinoe_ live at the bottom. Dr. Wallich writes in 1862--\"By\r\nsinking very fine gauze nets to considerable depths, I have repeatedly\r\nsatisfied myself that _Globigerina_ does not occur in the superficial\r\nstrata of the ocean.\"[7] Moreover, having obtained certain living star-\r\nfish from a depth of 1,260 fathoms, and found their stomachs full of\r\n\"fresh-looking _Globigerinoe_\" and their _débris_--he adduces this fact\r\nin support of his belief that the _Globigerinoe_ live at the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The _North Atlantic Sea-bed_, p. 137.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Müller, Haeckel, Major Owen, Mr. Gwyn Jeffries, and\r\nother observers, found that _Globigerinoe_, with the allied genera\r\n_Orbulina_ and _Pulvinulina_, sometimes occur abundantly at the surface\r\nof the sea, the shells of these pelagic forms being not unfrequently\r\nprovided with the long spines noticed by Macdonald; and in 1865 and 1866,\r\nMajor Owen more especially insisted on the importance of this fact. The\r\nrecent work of the _Challenger_ fully confirms Major Owen's statement. In\r\nthe paper recently published in the proceedings of the Royal Society,[8]\r\nfrom which a quotation has already been made, Professor Wyville Thomson\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"I had formed and expressed a very strong opinion on the matter. It\r\nseemed to me that the evidence was conclusive that the _Foraminifera_\r\nwhich formed the _Globigerina_ ooze lived on the bottom, and that the\r\noccurrence of individuals on the surface was accidental and exceptional;\r\nbut after going into the thing carefully, and considering the mass of\r\nevidence which has been accumulated by Mr. Murray, I now admit that I was\r\nin error; and I agree with him that it may be taken as proved that all\r\nthe materials of such deposits, with the exception, of course, of the\r\nremains of animals which we now know to live at the bottom at all depths,\r\nwhich occur in the deposit as foreign bodies, are derived from the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: \"Preliminary Notes on the Nature of the Sea-bottom procured\r\nby the soundings of H.M.S. _Challenger_ during her cruise in the Southern\r\nSeas, in the early part of the year 1874.\"--_Proceedings of the Royal\r\nSociety_, Nov. 26, 1874.]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Murray has combined with a careful examination of the soundings a\r\nconstant use of the tow-net, usually at the surface, but also at depths\r\nof from ten to one hundred fathoms; and he finds the closest relation to\r\nexist between the surface fauna of any particular locality and the\r\ndeposit which is taking place at the bottom. In all seas, from the\r\nequator to the polar ice, the tow-net contains _Globigerinoe_. They are\r\nmore abundant and of a larger size in warmer seas; several varieties,\r\nattaining a large size and presenting marked varietal characters, are\r\nfound in the intertropical area of the Atlantic. In the latitude of\r\nKerguelen they are less numerous and smaller, while further south they\r\nare still more dwarfed, and only one variety, the typical _Globigerina\r\nbulloides_, is represented. The living _Globigerinoe_ from the tow-net\r\nare singularly different in appearance from the dead shells we find at\r\nthe bottom. The shell is clear and transparent, and each of the pores\r\nwhich penetrate it is surrounded by a raised crest, the crest round\r\nadjacent pores coalescing into a roughly hexagonal network, so that the\r\npores appear to lie at the bottom of a hexagonal pit. At each angle of\r\nthis hexagon the crest gives off a delicate flexible calcareous spine,\r\nwhich is sometimes four or five times the diameter of the shell in\r\nlength. The spines radiate symmetrically from the direction of the centre\r\nof each chamber of the shell, and the sheaves of long transparent needles\r\ncrossing one another in different directions have a very beautiful\r\neffect. The smaller inner chambers of the shell are entirely filled with\r\nan orange-yellow granular sarcode; and the large terminal chamber usually\r\ncontains only a small irregular mass, or two or three small masses run\r\ntogether, of the same yellow sarcode stuck against one side, the\r\nremainder of the chamber being empty. No definite arrangement and no\r\napproach to structure was observed in the sarcode, and no\r\ndifferentiation, with the exception of round bright-yellow oil-globules,\r\nvery much like those found in some of the radiolarians, which are\r\nscattered, apparently irregularly, in the sarcode. We never have been\r\nable to detect, in any of the large number of _Globigerinoe_ which we\r\nhave examined, the least trace of pseudopodia, or any extension, in any\r\nform, of the sarcode beyond the shell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"In specimens taken with the tow-net the spines are very usually absent;\r\nbut that is probably on account of their extreme tenuity; they are broken\r\noff by the slightest touch. In fresh examples from the surface, the dots\r\nindicating the origin of the lost spines may almost always be made out\r\nwith a high power. There are never spines on the _Globigerinoe_ from the\r\nbottom, even in the shallowest water.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can now be no doubt, therefore, that _Globigerinoe_ live at the top\r\nof the sea; but the question may still be raised whether they do not also\r\nlive at the bottom. In favour of this view, it has been urged that the\r\nshells of the _Globigerinoe_ of the surface never possess such thick\r\nwalls as those which are fouled at the bottom, but I confess that I doubt\r\nthe accuracy of this statement. Again, the occurrence of minute\r\n_Globigerinoe_ in all stages of development, at the greatest depths, is\r\nbrought forward as evidence that they live _in situ_. But considering the\r\nextent to which the surface organisms are devoured, without\r\ndiscrimination of young and old, by _Salpoe_ and the like, it is not\r\nwonderful that shells of all ages should be among the rejectamenta. Nor\r\ncan the presence of the soft parts of the body in the shells which form\r\nthe _Globigerina_ ooze, and the fact, if it be one, that animals living\r\nat the bottom use them as food, be considered as conclusive evidence that\r\nthe _Globigerinoe_ live at the bottom. Such as die at the surface, and\r\neven many of those which are swallowed by other animals, may retain much\r\nof their protoplasmic matter when they reach the depths at which the\r\ntemperature sinks to 34° or 32° Fahrenheit, where decomposition must\r\nbecome exceedingly slow.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration appears to me to be in favour of the view that the\r\n_Globigerinoe_ and their allies are essentially surface animals. This is\r\nthe fact brought out by the _Challenger's_ work, that they have a\r\nsouthern limit of distribution, which can hardly depend upon anything but\r\nthe temperature of the surface water. And it is to be remarked that this\r\nsouthern limit occurs at a lower latitude in the Antarctic seas than it\r\ndoes in the North Atlantic. According to Dr. Wallich (\"The North Atlantic\r\nSea Bed,\" p. 157) _Globigerina_ is the prevailing form in the deposits\r\nbetween the Faroe Islands and Iceland, and between Iceland and East\r\nGreenland--or, in other words, in a region of the sea-bottom which lies\r\naltogether north of the parallel of 60° N.; while in the southern seas,\r\nthe _Globigerinoe_ become dwarfed and almost disappear between 50° and\r\n55° S. On the other hand, in the sea of Kamschatka, the _Globigerinoe_\r\nhave vanished in 56° N., so that the persistence of the _Globigerina_\r\nooze in high latitudes, in the North Atlantic, would seem to depend on\r\nthe northward curve of the isothermals peculiar to this region; and it is\r\ndifficult to understand how the formation of _Globigerina_ ooze can be\r\naffected by this climatal peculiarity unless it be effected by surface\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the mode of life of the _Foraminifera_, to which the\r\ncalcareous element of the deep-sea \"chalk\" owes its existence, the fact\r\nthat it is the chief and most widely spread material of the sea-bottom in\r\nthe intermediate zone, throughout both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,\r\nand the Indian Ocean, at depths from a few hundred to over two thousand\r\nfathoms, is established. But it is not the only extensive deposit which\r\nis now taking place. In 1853, Count Pourtalès, an officer of the United\r\nStates Coast Survey, which has done so much for scientific hydrography,\r\nobserved, that the mud forming the sea-bottom at depths of one hundred\r\nand fifty fathoms, in 31° 32' N., 79° 35' W., off the Coast of Florida,\r\nwas \"a mixture, in about equal proportions, of _Globigerinoe_ and black\r\nsand, probably greensand, as it makes a green mark when crushed on\r\npaper.\" Professor Bailey, examining these grains microscopically, found\r\nthat they were casts of the interior cavities of _Foraminifera_,\r\nconsisting of a mineral known as _Glauconite_, which is a silicate of\r\niron and alumina. In these casts the minutest cavities and finest tubes\r\nin the Foraminifer were sornetilnes reproduced in solid counterparts of\r\nthe glassy mineral, while the calcareous original had been entirely\r\ndissolved away.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with these observations, the indefatigable Ehrenberg\r\nhad discovered that the \"greensands\" of the geologist were largely made\r\nup of casts of a similar character, and proved the existence of\r\n_Foraminifera_ at a very ancient geological epoch, by discovering such\r\ncasts in a greensand of Lower Silurian age, which occurs near St.\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Messrs. Parker and Jones discovered similar casts in\r\nprocess of formation, the original shell not having disappeared, in\r\nspecimens of the sea-bottom of the Australian seas, brought home by the\r\nlate Professor Jukes. And the _Challenger_ has observed a deposit of a\r\nsimilar character in the course of the Agulhas current, near the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, and in some other localities not yet defined.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that this infiltration of _Foraminifera_ shells with\r\n_Glauconite_ does not take place at great depths, but rather in what may\r\nbe termed a sublittoral region, ranging from a hundred to three hundred\r\nfathoms. It cannot be ascribed to any local cause, for it takes place,\r\nnot only over large areas in the Gulf of Mexico and the Coast of Florida,\r\nbut in the South Atlantic and in the Pacific. But what are the conditions\r\nwhich determine its occurrence, and whence the silex, the iron, and the\r\nalumina (with perhaps potash and some other ingredients in small\r\nquantity) of which the _Glauconite_ is composed, proceed, is a point on\r\nwhich no light has yet been thrown. For the present we must be content\r\nwith the fact that, in certain areas of the \"intermediate zone,\"\r\ngreensand is replacing and representing the primitively calcareo-\r\nsilicious ooze.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the deposits which are now being formed in the basin\r\nof the Mediterranean, by the late Professor Edward Forbes, by Professor\r\nWilliamson and more recently by Dr. Carpenter, and a comparison of the\r\nresults thus obtained with what is known of the surface fauna, have\r\nbrought to light the remarkable fact, that while the surface and the\r\nshallows abound with _Foraminifera_ and other calcareous shelled\r\norganisms, the indications of life become scanty at depths beyond 500 or\r\n600 fathoms, while almost all traces of it disappear at greater depths,\r\nand at 1,000 to 2,000 fathoms the bottom is covered with a fine clay.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter has discussed the significance of this remarkable fact, and\r\nhe is disposed to attribute the absence of life at great depths, partly\r\nto the absence of any circulation of the water of the Mediterranean at\r\nsuch depths, and partly to the exhaustion of the oxygen of the water by\r\nthe organic matter contained in the fine clay, which he conceives to be\r\nformed by the finest particles of the mud brought down by the rivers\r\nwhich flow into the Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the explanation thus offered of the presence of the\r\nfine mud, and of the absence of organisms which ordinarily live at the\r\nbottom, does not account for the absence of the skeletons of the\r\norganisms which undoubtedly abound at the surface of the Mediterranean;\r\nand it would seem to have no application to the remarkable fact\r\ndiscovered by the _Challenger_, that in the open Atlantic and Pacific\r\nOceans, in the midst of the great intermediate zone, and thousands of\r\nmiles away from the embouchure of any river, the sea-bottom, at depths\r\napproaching to and beyond 3,000 fathoms, no longer consists of\r\n_Globigerina_ ooze, but of an excessively fine red clay.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thomson gives the following account of this capital\r\ndiscovery:--\r\n\r\n\"According to our present experience, the deposit of _Globigerina_ ooze\r\nis limited to water of a certain depth, the extreme limit of the pure\r\ncharacteristic formation being placed at a depth of somewhere about 2,250\r\nfathoms. Crossing from these shallower regions occupied by the ooze into\r\ndeeper soundings, we find, universally, that the calcareous formation\r\ngradually passes into, and is finally replaced by, an extremely fine pure\r\nclay, which occupies, speaking generally, all depths below 2,500 fathoms,\r\nand consists almost entirely of a silicate of the red oxide of iron and\r\nalumina. The transition is very slow, and extends over several hundred\r\nfathoms of increasing depth; the shells gradually lose their sharpness of\r\noutline, and assume a kind of 'rotten' look and a brownish colour, and\r\nbecome more and more mixed with a fine amorphous red-brown powder, which\r\nincreases steadily in proportion until the lime has almost entirely\r\ndisappeared. This brown matter is in the finest possible state of\r\nsubdivision, so fine that when, after sifting it to separate any\r\norganisms it might contain, we put it into jars to settle, it remained\r\nfor days in suspension, giving the water very much the appearance and\r\ncolour of chocolate.\r\n\r\n\"In indicating the nature of the bottom on the charts, we came, from\r\nexperience and without any theoretical considerations, to use three terms\r\nfor soundings in deep water. Two of these, Gl. oz. and r. cl., were very\r\ndefinite, and indicated strongly-marked formations, with apparently but\r\nfew characters in common; but we frequently got soundings which we could\r\nnot exactly call '_Globigerina_ ooze' or 'red clay,' and before we were\r\nfully aware of the nature of these, we were in the habit of indicating\r\nthem as 'grey ooze' (gr. oz.) We now recognise the 'grey ooze' as an\r\nintermediate stage between the _Globigerina_ ooze and the red clay; we\r\nfind that on one side, as it were, of an ideal line, the red clay\r\ncontains more and more of the material of the calcareous ooze, while on\r\nthe other, the ooze is mixed with an increasing proportion of 'red clay.'\r\n\r\n\"Although we have met with the same phenomenon so frequently, that we\r\nwere at length able to predict the nature of the bottom from the depth of\r\nthe soundings with absolute certainty for the Atlantic and the Southern\r\nSea, we had, perhaps, the best opportunity of observing it in our first\r\nsection across the Atlantic, between Teneriffe and St. Thomas. The first\r\nfour stations on this section, at depths from 1,525 to 2,220 fathoms,\r\nshow _Globigerina_ ooze. From the last of these, which is about 300 miles\r\nfrom Teneriffe, the depth gradually increases to 2,740 fathoms at 500,\r\nand 2,950 fathoms at 750 miles from Teneriffe. The bottom in these two\r\nsoundings might have been called 'grey ooze,' for although its nature has\r\naltered entirely from the _Globigerina_ ooze, the red clay into which it\r\nis rapidly passing still contains a considerable admixture of carbonate\r\nof lime.\r\n\r\n\"The depth goes on increasing to a distance of 1,150 miles from\r\nTeneriffe, when it reaches 3,150 fathoms; there the clay is pure and\r\nsmooth, and contains scarcely a trace of lime. From this great depth the\r\nbottom gradually rises, and, with decreasing depth, the grey colour and\r\nthe calcareous composition of the ooze return. Three soundings in 2,050,\r\n1,900, and 1,950 fathoms on the 'Dolphin Rise' gave highly characteristic\r\nexamples of the _Globigerina_ formation. Passing from the middle plateau\r\nof the Atlantic into the western trough, with depths a little over 3,000\r\nfathoms, the red clay returned in all its purity; and our last sounding,\r\nin 1,420 fathoms, before reaching Sombrero, restored the _Globigerina_\r\nooze with its peculiar associated fauna.\r\n\r\n\"This section shows also the wide extension and the vast geological\r\nimportance of the red clay formation. The total distance from Teneriffe\r\nto Sombrero is about 2,700 miles. Proceeding from east to west, we have--\r\n\r\nAbout     80 miles of volcanic mud and sand,\r\n  \"      350     \"    _Globigerina_ ooze,\r\n  \"    1,050     \"    red clay,\r\n  \"      330     \"    _Globigerina_ ooze,\r\n  \"      850     \"    red clay,\r\n  \"       40     \"    _Globigerina_ ooze;\r\n\r\ngiving a total of 1,900 miles of red clay to 720 miles of _Globigerina_\r\nooze.\r\n\r\n\"The nature and origin of this vast deposit of clay is a question of the\r\nvery greatest interest; and although I think there can be no doubt that\r\nit is in the main solved, yet some matters of detail are still involved\r\nin difficulty. My first impression was that it might be the most minutely\r\ndivided material, the ultimate sediment produced by the disintegration of\r\nthe land, by rivers and by the action of the sea on exposed coasts, and\r\nheld in suspension and distributed by ocean currents, and only making\r\nitself manifest in places unoccupied by the _Globigerina_ ooze. Several\r\ncircumstances seemed, however, to negative this mode of origin. The\r\nformation seemed too uniform: wherever we met with it, it had the same\r\ncharacter, and it only varied in composition in containing less or more\r\ncarbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n\"Again, the were gradually becoming more and more convinced that all the\r\nimportant elements of the _Globigerina_ ooze lived on the surface, and it\r\nseemed evident that, so long as the condition on the surface remained the\r\nsame, no alteration of contour at the bottom could possibly prevent its\r\naccumulation; and the surface conditions in the Mid-Atlantic were very\r\nuniform, a moderate current of a very equal temperature passing\r\ncontinuously over elevations and depressions, and everywhere yielding to\r\nthe tow-net the ooze-forming _Foraminifera_ in the same proportion. The\r\nMid-Atlantic swarms with pelagic _Mollusca_, and, in moderate depths, the\r\nshells of these are constantly mixed with the _Globigerina_ ooze,\r\nsometimes in number sufficient to make up a considerable portion of its\r\nbulk. It is clear that these shells must fall in equal numbers upon the\r\nred clay, but scarcely a trace of one of them is ever brought up by the\r\ndredge on the red clay area. It might be possible to explain the absence\r\nof shell-secreting animals living on the bottom, on the supposition that\r\nthe nature of the deposit was injurious to them; but then the idea of a\r\ncurrent sufficiently strong to sweep them away is negatived by the\r\nextreme fineness of the sediment which is being laid down; the absence of\r\nsurface shells appears to be intelligible only on the supposition that\r\nthey are in some way removed.\r\n\r\n\"We conclude, therefore, that the 'red clay' is not an additional\r\nsubstance introduced from without, and occupying certain depressed\r\nregions on account of some law regulating its deposition, but that it is\r\nproduced by the removal, by some means or other, over these areas, of the\r\ncarbonate of lime, which forms probably about 98 per cent. of the\r\nmaterial of the _Globigerina_ ooze. We can trace, indeed, every\r\nsuccessive stage in the removal of the carbonate of lime in descending\r\nthe slope of the ridge or plateau where the _Globigerina_ ooze is\r\nforming, to the region of the clay. We find, first, that the shells of\r\npteropods and other surface _Mollusca_ which are constantly falling on\r\nthe bottom, are absent, or, if a few remain, they are brittle and yellow,\r\nand evidently decaying rapidly. These shells of _Mollusca_ decompose more\r\neasily and disappear sooner than the smaller, and apparently more\r\ndelicate, shells of rhizopods. The smaller _Foraminifera_ now give way,\r\nand are found in lessening proportion to the larger; the coccoliths first\r\nlose their thin outer border and then disappear; and the clubs of the\r\nrhabdoliths get worn out of shape, and are last seen, under a high power,\r\nas infinitely minute cylinders scattered over the field. The larger\r\n_Foraminifera_ are attacked, and instead of being vividly white and\r\ndelicately sculptured, they become brown and worn, and finally they break\r\nup, each according to its fashion; the chamber-walls of _Globigerina_\r\nfall into wedge-shaped pieces, which quickly disappear, and a thick rough\r\ncrust breaks away from the surface of _Orbulina_, leaving a thin inner\r\nsphere, at first beautifully transparent, but soon becoming opaque and\r\ncrumbling away.\r\n\r\n\"In the meantime the proportion of the amorphous 'red clay' to the\r\ncalcareous elements of all kinds increases, until the latter disappear,\r\nwith the exception of a few scattered shells of the larger\r\n_Foraminifera_, which are still found even in the most characteristic\r\nsamples of the 'red clay.'\r\n\r\n\"There seems to be no room left for doubt that the red clay is\r\nessentially the insoluble residue, the _ash_, as it were, of the\r\ncalcareous organisms which form the _Globigerina_ ooze, after the\r\ncalcareous matter has been by some means removed. An ordinary mixture of\r\ncalcareous _Foraminifera_ with the shells of pteropods, forming a fair\r\nsample of _Globigerina_ ooze from near St. Thomas, was carefully washed,\r\nand subjected by Mr. Buchanan to the action of weak acid; and he found\r\nthat there remained after the carbonate of lime had been removed, about 1\r\nper cent. of a reddish mud, consisting of silica, alumina, and the red\r\noxide of iron. This experiment has been frequently repeated with\r\ndifferent samples of _Globigerina_ ooze, and always with the result that\r\na small proportion of a red sediment remains, which possesses all the\r\ncharacters of the red clay.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It seems evident from the observations here recorded, that _clay_, which\r\nwe have hitherto looked upon as essentially the product of the\r\ndisintegration of older rocks, may be, under certain circumstances, an\r\norganic formation like chalk; that, as a matter of fact, an area on the\r\nsurface of the globe, which we have shown to be of vast extent, although\r\nwe are still far from having ascertained its limits, is being covered by\r\nsuch a deposit at the present day.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible to avoid associating such a formation with the fine,\r\nsmooth, homogeneous clays and schists, poor in fossils, but showing worm-\r\ntubes and tracks, and bunches of doubtful branching things, such as\r\nOldhamia, silicious sponges, and thin-shelled peculiar shrimps. Such\r\nformations, more or less metamorphosed, are very familiar, especially to\r\nthe student of palaeozoic geology, and they often attain a vast thickness.\r\nOne is inclined, from the great resemblance between them in composition\r\nand in the general character of the included fauna, to suspect that these\r\nmay be organic formations, like the modern red clay of the Atlantic and\r\nSouthern Sea, accumulations of the insoluble ashes of shelled creatures.\r\n\r\n\"The dredging in the red clay on the 13th of March was usually rich. The\r\nbag contained examples, those with calcareous shells rather stunted, of\r\nmost of the characteristic deep-water groups of the Southern Sea,\r\nincluding _Umbellularia, Euplectella, Pterocrinus, Brisinga, Ophioglypha,\r\nPourtalesia_, and one or two _Mollusca_. This is, however, very rarely\r\nthe case. Generally the red clay is barren, or contains only a very small\r\nnumber of forms.\"\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that it is very difficult, at present, to frame any\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the mode of origin of this singular deposit\r\nof red clay.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that the theory put forward tentatively, and with much\r\nreservation by Professor Thomson, that the calcareous matter is dissolved\r\nout by the relatively fresh water of the deep currents from the Antarctic\r\nregions, appears satisfactory to me. Nor do I see my way to the\r\nacceptance of the suggestion of Dr. Carpenter, that the red clay is the\r\nresult of the decomposition of previously-formed greensand. At present\r\nthere is no evidence that greensand casts are ever formed at great\r\ndepths; nor has it been proved that _Glauconite_ is decomposable by the\r\nagency of water and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nI think it probable that we shall have to wait some time for a sufficient\r\nexplanation of the origin of the abyssal red clay, no less than for that\r\nof the sublittoral greensand in the intermediate zone. But the importance\r\nof the establishment of the fact that these various deposits are being\r\nformed in the ocean, at the present day, remains the same; whether its\r\n_rationale_ be understood or not.\r\n\r\nFor, suppose the globe to be evenly covered with sea, to a depth say of a\r\nthousand fathoms--then, whatever might be the mineral matter composing\r\nthe sea-bottom, little or no deposit would be formed upon it, the\r\nabrading and denuding action of water, at such a depth, being exceedingly\r\nslight.\r\n\r\nNext, imagine sponges, _Radiolaria, Foraminifera_, and diatomaceous\r\nplants, such as those which now exist in the deep-sea, to be introduced:\r\nthey would be distributed according to the same laws as at present, the\r\nsponges (and possibly some of the _Foraminifera_), covering the bottom,\r\nwhile other _Foraminifera_, with the _Radiolaria_ and _Diatomacea_, would\r\nincrease and multiply in the surface waters. In accordance with the\r\nexisting state of things, the _Radiolaria_ and Diatoms would have a\r\nuniversal distribution, the latter gathering most thickly in the polar\r\nregions, while the _Foraminifera_ would be largely, if not exclusively,\r\nconfined to the intermediate zone; and, as a consequence of this\r\ndistribution, a bed of \"chalk\" would begin to form in the intermediate\r\nzone, while caps of silicious rock would accumulate on the circumpolar\r\nregions.\r\n\r\nSuppose, further, that a part of the intermediate area were raised to\r\nwithin two or three hundred fathoms of the surface--for anything that we\r\nknow to the contrary, the change of level might determine the\r\nsubstitution of greensand for the \"chalk\"; while, on the other hand, if\r\npart of the same area were depressed to three thousand fathoms, that\r\nchange might determine the substitution of a different silicate of\r\nalumina and iron--namely, clay--for the \"chalk\" that would otherwise be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nIf the _Challenger_ hypothesis, that the red clay is the residue left by\r\ndissolved _Foraminiferous_ skeletons, is correct, then all these deposits\r\nalike would be directly, or indirectly, the product of living organisms.\r\nBut just as a silicious deposit may be metamorphosed into opal or\r\nquartzite, and chalk into marble, so known metamorphic agencies may\r\nmetamorphose clay into schist, clay-slate, slate, gneiss, or even\r\ngranite. And thus, by the agency of the lowest and simplest of organisms,\r\nour imaginary globe might be covered with strata, of all the chief kinds\r\nof rock of which the known crust of the earth is composed, of indefinite\r\nthickness and extent.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the conclusions which are now either established, or\r\nhighly probable, respecting the origin of silicious, calcareous, and\r\nclayey rocks, and their metamorphic derivatives, upon the archaeology of\r\nthe earth, the elucidation of which is the ultimate object of the\r\ngeologist, is of no small importance.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago the singular insight of Linnaeus enabled him to say\r\nthat \"fossils are not the children but the parents of rocks,\"[9] and the\r\nwhole effect of the discoveries made since his time has been to compile a\r\nlarger and larger commentary upon this text. It is, at present, a\r\nperfectly tenable hypothesis that all siliceous and calcareous rocks are\r\neither directly, or indirectly, derived from material which has, at one\r\ntime or other, formed part of the organized framework of living\r\norganisms. Whether the same generalization may be extended to aluminous\r\nrocks, depends upon the conclusion to be drawn from the facts respecting\r\nthe red clay areas brought to light by the _Challenger_. If we accept the\r\nview taken by Wyville Thomson and his colleagues--that the red clay is\r\nthe residuum left after the calcareous matter of the _Globigerinoe_ ooze\r\nhas been dissolved away--then clay is as much a product of life as\r\nlimestone, and all known derivatives of clay may have formed part of\r\nanimal bodies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: \"Petrificata montium calcariorum non filii sed parentes\r\nsunt, cum omnis calx oriatur ab animalibus.\"--_Systema Naturae_, Ed. xii.,\r\nt. iii., p. 154. It must be recollected that Linnaeus included silex, as\r\nwell as limestone, under the name of \"calx,\" and that he would probably\r\nhave arranged Diatoms among animals, as part of \"chaos.\" Ehrenberg quotes\r\nanother even more pithy passage, which I have not been able to find in\r\nany edition of the _Systema_ accessible to me: \"Sic lapides ab\r\nanimalibus, nec vice versa. Sic runes saxei non primaevi, sed temporis\r\nfiliae.\"]\r\n\r\nSo long as the _Globigerinoe_;, actually collected at the surface, have\r\nnot been demonstrated to contain the elements of clay, the _Challenger_\r\nhypothesis, as I may term it, must be accepted with reserve and\r\nprovisionally, but, at present, I cannot but think that it is more\r\nprobable than any other suggestion which has been made.\r\n\r\nAccepting it provisionally, we arrive at the remarkable result that all\r\nthe chief known constituents of the crust of the earth may have formed\r\npart of living bodies; that they may be the \"ash\" of protoplasm; that the\r\n\"_rupes saxei_\" are not only _\"temporis,\"_ but \"_vitae filiae_\"; and,\r\nconsequently, that the time during which life has been active on the\r\nglobe may be indefinitely greater than the period, the commencement of\r\nwhich is marked by the oldest known rocks, whether fossiliferous or\r\nunfossiliferous.\r\n\r\nAnd thus we are led to see where the solution of a great problem and\r\napparent paradox of geology may lie. Satisfactory evidence now exists\r\nthat some animals in the existing world have been derived by a process of\r\ngradual modification from pre-existing forms. It is undeniable, for\r\nexample, that the evidence in favour of the derivation of the horse from\r\nthe later tertiary _Hipparion_, and that of the _Hipparion_ from\r\n_Anchitherium_, is as complete and cogent as such evidence can reasonably\r\nbe expected to be; and the further investigations into the history of the\r\ntertiary mammalia are pushed, the greater is the accumulation of evidence\r\nhaving the same tendency. So far from palaeontology lending no support to\r\nthe doctrine of evolution--as one sees constantly asserted--that\r\ndoctrine, if it had no other support, would have been irresistibly forced\r\nupon us by the palaeontological discoveries of the last twenty years.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the diverse forms of life which now exist have been produced\r\nby the modification of previously-existing less divergent forms, the\r\nrecent and extinct species, taken as a whole, must fall into series which\r\nmust converge as we go back in time. Hence, if the period represented by\r\nthe rocks is greater than, or co-extensive with, that during which life\r\nhas existed, we ought, somewhere among the ancient formations, to arrive\r\nat the point to which all these series converge, or from which, in other\r\nwords, they have diverged--the primitive undifferentiated protoplasmic\r\nliving things, whence the two great series of plants and animals have\r\ntaken their departure.\r\n\r\nBut, as a matter of fact, the amount of convergence of series, in\r\nrelation to the time occupied by the deposition of geological formations,\r\nis extraordinarily small. Of all animals the higher _Vertebrata_ are the\r\nmost complex; and among these the carnivores and hoofed animals\r\n(_Ungulata_) are highly differentiated. Nevertheless, although the\r\ndifferent lines of modification of the _Carnivora_ and those of the\r\n_Ungulata_, respectively, approach one another, and, although each group\r\nis represented by less differentiated forms in the older tertiary rocks\r\nthan at the present day, the oldest tertiary rocks do not bring us near\r\nthe primitive form of either. If, in the same way, the convergence of the\r\nvaried forms of reptiles is measured against the time during which their\r\nremains are preserved--which is represented by the whole of the tertiary\r\nand mesozoic formations--the amount of that convergence is far smaller\r\nthan that of the lines of mammals between the present time and the\r\nbeginning of the tertiary epoch. And it is a broad fact that, the lower\r\nwe go in the scale of organization, the fewer signs are there of\r\nconvergence towards the primitive form from whence all must have\r\ndiverged, if evolution be a fact. Nevertheless, that it is a fact in some\r\ncases, is proved, and I, for one, have not the courage to suppose that\r\nthe mode in which some species have taken their origin is different from\r\nthat in which the rest have originated.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, has become of all the marine animals which, on the hypothesis\r\nof evolution, must have existed in myriads in those seas, wherein the\r\nmany thousand feet of Cambrian and Laurentian rocks now devoid, or almost\r\ndevoid, of any trace of life were deposited?\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell long ago suggested that the azoic character of these\r\nancient formations might be due to the fact that they had undergone\r\nextensive metamorphosis; and readers of the \"Principles of Geology\" will\r\nbe familiar with the ingenious manner in which he contrasts the theory of\r\nthe Gnome, who is acquainted only with the interior of the earth, with\r\nthose of ordinary philosophers, who know only its exterior.\r\n\r\nThe metamorphism contemplated by the great modern champion of rational\r\ngeology is, mainly, that brought about by the exposure of rocks to\r\nsubterranean heat; and where no such heat could be shown to have\r\noperated, his opponents assumed that no metamorphosis could have taken\r\nplace. But the formation of greensand, and still more that of the \"red\r\nclay\" (if the _Challenger_ hypothesis be correct) affords an insight into\r\na new kind of metamorphosis--not igneous, but aqueous--by which the\r\nprimitive nature of a deposit may be masked as completely as it can be by\r\nthe agency of heat. And, as Wyville Thomson suggests, in the passage I\r\nhave quoted above (p. 17), it further enables us to assign a new cause\r\nfor the occurrence, so puzzling hitherto, of thousands of feet of\r\nunfossiliferous fine-grained schists and slates, in the midst of\r\nformations deposited in seas which certainly abounded in life. If the\r\ngreat deposit of \"red clay\" now forming in the eastern valley of the\r\nAtlantic were metamorphosed into slate and then upheaved, it would\r\nconstitute an \"azoic\" rock of enormous extent. And yet that rock is now\r\nforming in the midst of a sea which swarms with living beings, the great\r\nmajority of which are provided with calcareous or silicious shells and\r\nskeletons; and, therefore, are such as, up to this time, we should have\r\ntermed eminently preservable.\r\n\r\nThus the discoveries made by the _Challenger_ expedition, like all recent\r\nadvances in our knowledge of the phenomena of biology, or of the changes\r\nnow being effected in the structure of the surface of the earth, are in\r\naccordance with and lend strong support to, that doctrine of\r\nUniformitarianism, which, fifty years ago, was held only by a small\r\nminority of English geologists--Lyell, Scrope, and De la Beche--but now,\r\nthanks to the long-continued labours of the first two, and mainly to\r\nthose of Sir Charles Lyell, has gradually passed from the position of a\r\nheresy to that of catholic doctrine.\r\n\r\nApplied within the limits of the time registered by the known fraction of\r\nthe crust of the earth, I believe that uniformitarianism is unassailable.\r\nThe evidence that, in the enormous lapse of time between the deposition\r\nof the lowest Laurentian strata and the present day, the forces which\r\nhave modified the surface of the crust of the earth were different in\r\nkind, or greater in the intensity of their action, than those which are\r\nnow occupied in the same work, has yet to be produced. Such evidence as\r\nwe possess all tends in the contrary direction, and is in favour of the\r\nsame slow and gradual changes occurring then as now.\r\n\r\nBut this conclusion in nowise conflicts with the deductions of the\r\nphysicist from his no less clear and certain data. It may be certain that\r\nthis globe has cooled down from a condition in which life could not have\r\nexisted; it may be certain that, in so cooling, its contracting crust\r\nmust have undergone sudden convulsions, which were to our earthquakes as\r\nan earthquake is to the vibration caused by the periodical eruption of a\r\nGeyser; but in that case, the earth must, like other respectable parents,\r\nhave sowed her wild oats, and got through her turbulent youth, before we,\r\nher children, have any knowledge of her.\r\n\r\nSo far as the evidence afforded by the superficial crust of the earth\r\ngoes, the modern geologist can, _ex animo_, repeat the saying of Hutton,\r\n\"We find no vestige of a beginning--no prospect of an end.\" However, he\r\nwill add, with Hutton, \"But in thus tracing back the natural operations\r\nwhich have succeeded each other, and mark to us the course of time past,\r\nwe come to a period in which we cannot see any further.\" And if he seek\r\nto peer into the darkness of this period, he will welcome the light\r\nproffered by physics and mathematics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n\r\nYEAST\r\n\r\n[1871]\r\n\r\nIt has been known, from time immemorial, that the sweet liquids which may\r\nbe obtained by expressing the juices of the fruits and stems of various\r\nplants, or by steeping malted barley in hot water, or by mixing honey\r\nwith water--are liable to undergo a series of very singular changes, if\r\nfreely exposed to the air and left to themselves, in warm weather.\r\nHowever clear and pellucid the liquid may have been when first prepared,\r\nhowever carefully it may have been freed, by straining and filtration,\r\nfrom even the finest visible impurities, it will not remain clear. After\r\na time it will become cloudy and turbid; little bubbles will be seen\r\nrising to the surface, and their abundance will increase until the liquid\r\nhisses as if it were simmering on the fire. By degrees, some of the solid\r\nparticles which produce the turbidity of the liquid collect at its\r\nsurface into a scum, which is blown up by the emerging air-bubbles into a\r\nthick, foamy froth. Another moiety sinks to the bottom, and accumulates\r\nas a muddy sediment, or \"lees.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this action has continued, with more or less violence, for a certain\r\ntime, it gradually moderates. The evolution of bubbles slackens, and\r\nfinally comes to an end; scum and lees alike settle at the bottom, and\r\nthe fluid is once more clear and transparent. But it has acquired\r\nproperties of which no trace existed in the original liquid. Instead of\r\nbeing a mere sweet fluid, mainly composed of sugar and water, the sugar\r\nhas more or less completely disappeared; and it has acquired that\r\npeculiar smell and taste which we call \"spirituous.\" Instead of being\r\ndevoid of any obvious effect upon the animal economy, it has become\r\npossessed of a very wonderful influence on the nervous system; so that in\r\nsmall doses it exhilarates, while in larger it stupefies, and may even\r\ndestroy life.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if the original fluid is put into a still, and heated\r\nmoderately, the first and last product of its distillation is simple\r\nwater; while, when the altered fluid is subjected to the same process,\r\nthe matter which is first condensed in the receiver is found to be a\r\nclear, volatile substance, which is lighter than water, has a pungent\r\ntaste and smell, possesses the intoxicating powers of the fluid in an\r\neminent degree, and takes fire the moment it is brought in contact with a\r\nflame. The Alchemists called this volatile liquid, which they obtained\r\nfrom wine, \"spirits of wine,\" just as they called hydrochloric acid\r\n\"spirits of salt,\" and as we, to this day, call refined turpentine\r\n\"spirits of turpentine.\" As the \"spiritus,\" or breath, of a man was\r\nthought to be the most refined and subtle part of him, the intelligent\r\nessence of man was also conceived as a sort of breath, or spirit; and, by\r\nanalogy, the most refined essence of anything was called its \"spirit.\"\r\nAnd thus it has come about that we use the same word for the soul of man\r\nand for a glass of gin.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, however, we even more commonly use another name for\r\nthis peculiar liquid--namely, \"alcohol,\" and its origin is not less\r\nsingular. The Dutch physician, Van Helmont, lived in the latter part of\r\nthe sixteenth and the beginning of the seventeenth century--in the\r\ntransition period between alchemy and chemistry--and was rather more\r\nalchemist than chemist. Appended to his \"Opera Omnia,\" published in 1707,\r\nthere is a very needful \"Clavis ad obscuriorum sensum referendum,\" in\r\nwhich the following passage occurs.--\r\n\r\n\"ALCOHOL.--Chymicis est liquor aut pulvis summé subtilisatus, vocabulo\r\nOrientalibus quoque, cum primis Habessinis, familiari, quibus _cohol_\r\nspeciatim pulverem impalpabilem ex antimonio pro oculis tingendis denotat\r\n... Hodie autem, ob analogiam, quivis pulvis tenerior ut pulvis oculorum\r\ncancri summé subtilisatus _alcohol_ audit, haud aliter ac spiritus\r\nrectificatissimi _alcolisati_ dicuntur.\"\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Robert Boyle speaks of a fine powder as \"alcohol\"; and, so\r\nlate as the middle of the last century, the English lexicographer, Nathan\r\nBailey, defines \"alcohol\" as \"the pure substance of anything separated\r\nfrom the more gross, a very fine and impalpable powder, or a very pure,\r\nwell-rectified spirit.\" But, by the time of the publication of\r\nLavoisier's \"Traité Elémentaire de Chimie,\" in 1789, the term \"alcohol,\"\r\n\"alkohol,\" or \"alkool\" (for it is spelt in all three ways), which Van\r\nHelmont had applied primarily to a fine powder, and only secondarily to\r\nspirits of wine, had lost its primary meaning altogether; and, from the\r\nend of the last century until now, it has, I believe, been used\r\nexclusively as the denotation of spirits of wine, and bodies chemically\r\nallied to that substance.\r\n\r\nThe process which gives rise to alcohol in a saccharine fluid is known\r\ntones as \"fermentation\"; a term based upon the apparent boiling up or\r\n\"effervescence\" of the fermenting liquid, and of Latin origin.\r\n\r\nOur Teutonic cousins call the same process \"gähren,\" \"gäsen,\" \"göschen,\"\r\nand \"gischen\"; but, oddly enough, we do not seem to have retained their\r\nverb or their substantive denoting the action itself, though we do use\r\nnames identical with, or plainly derived from, theirs for the scum and\r\nlees. These are called, in Low German, \"gäscht\" and \"gischt\"; in Anglo-\r\nSaxon, \"gest,\" \"gist,\" and \"yst,\" whence our \"yeast.\" Again, in Low\r\nGerman and in Anglo-Saxon there is another name for yeast, having the\r\nform \"barm,\" or \"beorm\"; and, in the Midland Counties, \"barm\" is the name\r\nby which yeast is still best known. In High German, there is a third name\r\nfor yeast, \"hefe,\" which is not represented in English, so far as I know.\r\n\r\nAll these words are said by philologers to be derived from roots\r\nexpressive of the intestine motion of a fermenting substance. Thus \"hefe\"\r\nis derived from \"heben,\" to raise; \"barm\" from \"beren\" or \"bären,\" to\r\nbear up; \"yeast,\" \"yst,\" and \"gist,\" have all to do with seething and\r\nfoam, with \"yeasty\" waves, and \"gusty\" breezes.\r\n\r\nThe same reference to the swelling up of the fermenting substance is seen\r\nin the Gallo-Latin terms \"levure\" and \"leaven.\"\r\n\r\nIt is highly creditable to the ingenuity of our ancestors that the\r\npeculiar property of fermented liquids, in virtue of which they \"make\r\nglad the heart of man,\" seems to have been known in the remotest periods\r\nof which we have any record. All savages take to alcoholic fluids as if\r\nthey were to the manner born. Our Vedic forefathers intoxicated\r\nthemselves with the juice of the \"soma\"; Noah, by a not unnatural\r\nreaction against a superfluity of water, appears to have taken the\r\nearliest practicable opportunity of qualifying that which he was obliged\r\nto drink; and the ghosts of the ancient Egyptians were solaced by\r\npictures of banquets in which the wine-cup passes round, graven on the\r\nwalls of their tombs. A knowledge of the process of fermentation,\r\ntherefore, was in all probability possessed by the prehistoric\r\npopulations of the globe; and it must have become a matter of great\r\ninterest even to primaeval wine-bibbers to study the methods by which\r\nfermented liquids could be surely manufactured. No doubt it was soon\r\ndiscovered that the most certain, as well as the most expeditious, way of\r\nmaking a sweet juice ferment was to add to it a little of the scum, or\r\nlees, of another fermenting juice. And it can hardly be questioned that\r\nthis singular excitation of fermentation in one fluid, by a sort of\r\ninfection, or inoculation, of a little ferment taken from some other\r\nfluid, together with the strange swelling, foaming, and hissing of the\r\nfermented substance, must have always attracted attention from the more\r\nthoughtful. Nevertheless, the commencement of the scientific analysis of\r\nthe phenomena dates from a period not earlier than the first half of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nAt this time, Van Helmont made a first step, by pointing out that the\r\npeculiar hissing and bubbling of a fermented liquid is due, not to the\r\nevolution of common air (which he, as the inventor of the term \"gas,\"\r\ncalls \"gas ventosum\"), but to that of a peculiar kind of air such as is\r\noccasionally met with in caves, mines, and wells, and which he calls \"gas\r\nsylvestre.\"\r\n\r\nBut a century elapsed before the nature of this \"gas sylvestre,\" or, as\r\nit was afterwards called, \"fixed air,\" was clearly determined, and it was\r\nfound to be identical with that deadly \"choke-damp\" by which the lives of\r\nthose who descend into old wells, or mines, or brewers' vats, are\r\nsometimes suddenly ended; and with the poisonous aëriform fluid which is\r\nproduced by the combustion of charcoal, and now goes by the name of\r\ncarbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\nDuring the same time it gradually became evident that the presence of\r\nsugar was essential to the production of alcohol and the evolution of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, which are the two great and conspicuous products of\r\nfermentation. And finally, in 1787, the Italian chemist, Fabroni, made\r\nthe capital discovery that the yeast ferment, the presence of which is\r\nnecessary to fermentation, is what he termed a \"vegeto-animal\" substance;\r\nthat is, a body which gives of ammoniacal salts when it is burned, and\r\nis, in other ways, similar to the gluten of plants and the albumen and\r\ncasein of animals.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries prepared the way for the illustrious Frenchman,\r\nLavoisier, who first approached the problem of fermentation with a\r\ncomplete conception of the nature of the work to be done. The words in\r\nwhich he expresses this conception, in the treatise on elementary\r\nchemistry to which reference has already been made, mark the year 1789 as\r\nthe commencement of a revolution of not less moment in the world of\r\nscience than that which simultaneously burst over the political world,\r\nand soon engulfed Lavoisier himself in one of its mad eddies.\r\n\r\n\"We may lay it down as an incontestable axiom that, in all the operations\r\nof art and nature, nothing is created; an equal quantity of matter exists\r\nboth before, and after the experiment: the quality and quantity of the\r\nelements remain precisely the same, and nothing takes place beyond\r\nchanges and modifications in the combinations of these elements. Upon\r\nthis principle the whole art of performing chemical experiments depends;\r\nwe must always suppose an exact equality between the elements of the body\r\nexamined and those of the products of its analysis.\r\n\r\n\"Hence, since from must of grapes we procure alcohol and carbonic acid, I\r\nhave an undoubted right to suppose that must consists of carbonic acid\r\nand alcohol. From these premisses we have two modes of ascertaining what\r\npasses during vinous fermentation: either by determining the nature of,\r\nand the elements which compose, the fermentable substances; or by\r\naccurately examining the products resulting from fermentation; and it is\r\nevident that the knowledge of either of these must lead to accurate\r\nconclusions concerning the nature and composition of the other. From\r\nthese considerations it became necessary accurately to determine the\r\nconstituent elements of the fermentable substances; and for this purpose\r\nI did not make use of the compound juices of fruits, the rigorous\r\nanalysis of which is perhaps impossible, but made choice of sugar, which\r\nis easily analysed, and the nature of which I have already explained.\r\nThis substance is a true vegetable oxyd, with two bases, composed of\r\nhydrogen and carbon, brought to the state of an oxyd by means of a\r\ncertain proportion of oxygen; and these three elements are combined in\r\nsuch a way that a very slight force is sufficient to destroy the\r\nequilibrium of their connection.\"\r\n\r\nAfter giving the details of his analysis of sugar and of the products of\r\nfermentation, Lavoisier continues:--\r\n\r\n\"The effect of the vinous fermentation upon sugar is thus reduced to the\r\nmere separation of its elements into two portions; one part is oxygenated\r\nat the expense of the other, so as to form carbonic acid; while the other\r\npart, being disoxygenated in favour of the latter, is converted into the\r\ncombustible substance called alkohol; therefore, if it were possible to\r\nre-unite alkohol and carbonic acid together, we ought to form sugar.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Elements of Chemistry_. By M. Lavoisier. Translated by\r\nRobert Kerr. Second Edition, 1793 (pp. 186-196).]\r\n\r\nThus Lavoisier thought he had demonstrated that the carbonic acid and the\r\nalcohol which are produced by the process of fermentation, are equal in\r\nweight to the sugar which disappears; but the application of the more\r\nrefined methods of modern chemistry to the investigation of the products\r\nof fermentation by Pasteur, in 1860, proved that this is not exactly\r\ntrue, and that there is a deficit of from 5 to 7 per cent of the sugar\r\nwhich is not covered by the alcohol and carbonic acid evolved. The\r\ngreater part of this deficit is accounted for by the discovery of two\r\nsubstances, glycerine and succinic acid, of the existence of which\r\nLavoisier was unaware, in the fermented liquid. But about 1-1/2 per cent.\r\nstill remains to be made good. According to Pasteur, it has been\r\nappropriated by the yeast, but the fact that such appropriation takes\r\nplace cannot be said to be actually proved.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, there can be no doubt that the constituent elements\r\nof fully 98 per cent. of the sugar which has vanished during fermentation\r\nhave simply undergone rearrangement; like the soldiers of a brigade, who\r\nat the word of command divide themselves into the independent regiments\r\nto which they belong. The brigade is sugar, the regiments are carbonic\r\nacid, succinic acid, alcohol, and glycerine.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Fabroni, onwards, it has been admitted that the agent by\r\nwhich this surprising rearrangement of the particles of the sugar is\r\neffected is the yeast. But the first thoroughly conclusive evidence of\r\nthe necessity of yeast for the fermentation of sugar was furnished by\r\nAppert, whose method of preserving perishable articles of food excited so\r\nmuch attention in France at the beginning of this century. Gay-Lussac, in\r\nhis \"Mémoire sur la Fermentation,\"[2] alludes to Appert's method of\r\npreserving beer-wort unfermented for an indefinite time, by simply\r\nboiling the wort and closing the vessel in which the boiling fluid is\r\ncontained, in such a way as thoroughly to exclude air; and he shows that,\r\nif a little yeast be introduced into such wort, after it has cooled, the\r\nwort at once begins to ferment, even though every precaution be taken to\r\nexclude air. And this statement has since received full confirmation from\r\nPasteur.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Annales de Chimie_, 1810.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Schwann, Schroeder and Dutch, and Pasteur, have amply\r\nproved that air may be allowed to have free access to beer-wort, without\r\nexciting fermentation, if only efficient precautions are taken to prevent\r\nthe entry of particles of yeast along with the air.\r\n\r\nThus, the truth that the fermentation of a simple solution of sugar in\r\nwater depends upon the presence of yeast, rests upon an unassailable\r\nfoundation; and the inquiry into the exact nature of the substance which\r\npossesses such a wonderful chemical influence becomes profoundly\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe first step towards the solution of this problem was made two\r\ncenturies ago by the patient and painstaking Dutch naturalist,\r\nLeeuwenhoek, who in the year 1680 wrote thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Saepissime examinavi fermnentum cerevisiae, semperque hoc ex globulis per\r\nmateriam pellucidam fluitantibus, quarm cerevisiam esse censui, constare\r\nobservavi: vidi etiam evidentissime, unumquemque hujus fermenti globulum\r\ndenuo ex sex distinctis globulis constare, accurate eidem quantitate et\r\nformae, cui globulis sanguinis nostri, respondentibus.\r\n\r\n\"Verum talis mihi de horum origine et formatione conceptus formabam;\r\nglobulis nempe ex quibus farina Tritici, Hordei, Avenae, Fagotritici, se\r\nconstat aquae calore dissolvi et aquae commisceri; hac, vero aqua, quam\r\ncerevisiam vocare licet, refrigescente, multos ex minimis particulis in\r\ncerevisia coadunari, et hoc pacto efficere particulam sive globulum, quae\r\nsexta pars est globuli faecis, et iterum sex ex hisce globulis\r\nconjungi.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Leeuwenhoek, _Arcana Naturae Detecta._ Ed. Nov., 1721.]\r\n\r\nThus Leeuwenhoek discovered that yeast consists of globules floating in a\r\nfluid; but he thought that they were merely the starchy particles of the\r\ngrain from which the wort was made, rearranged. He discovered the fact\r\nthat yeast had a definite structure, but not the meaning of the fact. A\r\ncentury and a half elapsed, and the investigation of yeast was\r\nrecommenced almost simultaneously by Cagniard de la Tour in France, and\r\nby Schwann and Kützing in Germany. The French observer was the first to\r\npublish his results; and the subject received at his hands and at those\r\nof his colleague, the botanist Turpin, full and satisfactory\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nThe main conclusions at which they arrived are these. The globular, or\r\noval, corpuscles which float so thickly in the yeast as to make it muddy,\r\nthough the largest are not more than one two-thousandth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, and the smallest may measure less than one seven-thousandth of\r\nan inch, are living organisms. They multiply with great rapidity by\r\ngiving off minute buds, which soon attain the size of their parent, and\r\nthen either become detached or remain united, forming the compound\r\nglobules of which Leeuwenhoek speaks, though the constancy of their\r\narrangement in sixes existed only in the worthy Dutchman's imagination.\r\n\r\nIt was very soon made out that these yeast organisms, to which Turpin\r\ngave the name of _Torula cerevisioe_, were more nearly allied to the\r\nlower Fungi than to anything else. Indeed Turpin, and subsequently\r\nBerkeley and Hoffmann, believed that they had traced the development of\r\nthe _Torula_ into the well-known and very common mould--the _Penicillium\r\nglaucum_. Other observers have not succeeded in verifying these\r\nstatements; and my own observations lead me to believe, that while the\r\nconnection between _Torula_ and the moulds is a very close one, it is of\r\na different nature from that which has been supposed. I have never been\r\nable to trace the development of _Torula_ into a true mould; but it is\r\nquite easy to prove that species of true mould, such as _Penicillium_,\r\nwhen sown in an appropriate nidus, such as a solution of tartrate of\r\nammonia and yeast-ash, in water, with or without sugar, give rise to\r\n_Toruloe_, similar in all respects to _T. cerevisioe_, except that they\r\nare, on the average, smaller. Moreover, Bail has observed the development\r\nof a _Torula_ larger than _T. cerevisioe_, from a _Mucor_, a mould allied\r\nto _Penicillium_.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that the _Toruloe_, or organisms of yeast, are\r\nveritable plants; and conclusive experiments have proved that the power\r\nwhich causes the rearrangement of the molecules of the sugar is\r\nintimately connected with the life and growth of the plant. In fact,\r\nwhatever arrests the vital activity of the plant also prevents it from\r\nexciting fermentation.\r\n\r\nSuch being the facts with regard to the nature of yeast, and the changes\r\nwhich it effects in sugar, how are they to be accounted for? Before\r\nmodern chemistry had come into existence, Stahl, stumbling, with the\r\nstride of genius, upon the conception which lies at the bottom of all\r\nmodern views of the process, put forward the notion that the ferment,\r\nbeing in a state of internal motion, communicated that motion to the\r\nsugar, and thus caused its resolution into new substances. And Lavoisier,\r\nas we have seen, adopts substantially the same view. But Fabroni, full of\r\nthe then novel conception of acids and bases and double decompositions,\r\npropounded the hypothesis that sugar is an oxide with two bases, and the\r\nferment a carbonate with two bases; that the carbon of the ferment unites\r\nwith the oxygen of the sugar, and gives rise to carbonic acid; while the\r\nsugar, uniting with the nitrogen of the ferment, produces a new substance\r\nanalogous to opium. This is decomposed by distillation, and gives rise to\r\nalcohol. Next, in 1803, Thénard propounded a hypothesis which partakes\r\nsomewhat of the nature of both Stahl's and Fabroni's views. \"I do not\r\nbelieve with Lavoisier,\" he says, \"that all the carbonic acid formed\r\nproceeds from the sugar. How, in that case, could we conceive the action\r\nof the ferment on it? I think that the first portions of the acid are due\r\nto a combination of the carbon of the ferment with the oxygen of the\r\nsugar, and that it is by carrying off a portion of oxygen from the last\r\nthat the ferment causes the fermentation to commence--the equilibrium\r\nbetween the principles of the sugar being disturbed, they combine afresh\r\nto form carbonic acid and alcohol.\"\r\n\r\nThe three views here before us may be familiarly exemplified by supposing\r\nthe sugar to be a card-house. According to Stahl, the ferment is somebody\r\nwho knocks the table, and shakes the card-house down; according to\r\nFabroni, the ferment takes out some cards, but puts others in their\r\nplaces; according to Thénard, the ferment simply takes a card out of the\r\nbottom story, the result of which is that all the others fall.\r\n\r\nAs chemistry advanced, facts came to light which put a new face upon\r\nStahl's hypothesis, and gave it a safer foundation than it previously\r\npossessed. The general nature of these phenomena may be thus stated:--A\r\nbody, A, without giving to, or taking from, another body B, any material\r\nparticles, causes B to decompose into other substances, C, D, E, the sum\r\nof the weights of which is equal to the weight of B, which decomposes.\r\nThus, bitter almonds contain two substances, amygdalin and synaptase,\r\nwhich can be extracted, in a separate state, from the bitter almonds. The\r\namygdalin thus obtained, if dissolved in water, undergoes no change; but\r\nif a little synaptase be added to the solution, the amygdalin splits up\r\ninto bitter almond oil, prussic acid, and a kind of sugar.\r\n\r\nA short time after Cagniard de la Tour discovered the yeast plant,\r\nLiebig, struck with the similarity between this and other such processes\r\nand the fermentation of sugar, put forward the hypothesis that yeast\r\ncontains a substance which acts upon sugar, as synaptase acts upon\r\namygdalin. And as the synaptase is certainly neither organized nor alive,\r\nbut a mere chemical substance, Liebig treated Cagniard de la Tour's\r\ndiscovery with no small contempt, and, from that time to the present, has\r\nsteadily repudiated the notion that the decomposition of the sugar is, in\r\nany sense, the result of the vital activity of the _Torula_. But, though\r\nthe notion that the _Torula_ is a creature which eats sugar and excretes\r\ncarbonic acid and alcohol, which is not unjustly ridiculed in the most\r\nsurprising paper that ever made its appearance in a grave scientific\r\njournal,[4] may be untenable, the fact that the _Toruloe_ are alive, and\r\nthat yeast does not excite fermentation unless it contains living\r\n_Toruloe_, stands fast. Moreover, of late years, the essential\r\nparticipation of living organisms in fermentation other than the\r\nalcoholic, has been clearly made out by Pasteur and other chemists.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"Das enträthselte Geheimniss der geistigen Gährung\r\n(Vorlänfige briefliche Mittheilung)\" is the title of an anonymous\r\ncontribution to Wöhler and Liebig's _Annalen der Pharmacie_ for 1839, in\r\nwhich a somewhat Rabelaisian imaginary description of the organisation of\r\nthe \"yeast animals\" and of the manner in which their functions are\r\nperformed, is given with a circumstantiality worthy of the author of\r\n_Gulliver's Travels_. As a specimen of the writer's humour, his account\r\nof what happens when fermentation comes to an end may suffice. \"Sobald\r\nnämlich die Thiere keinen Zucker mehr vorfinden, so fressen sie sich\r\ngegenseitig selbst auf, was durch eine eigene Manipulation geschieht;\r\nalles wird verdant bis auf die Eier, welche unverändert durch den\r\nDarmkanal hineingehen; man hat zuletzt wieder gährungsfähige Hefe,\r\nnämlich den Saamen der Thiere, der übrig bleibt.\"] However, it may be\r\nasked, is there any necessary opposition between the so-called \"vital\"\r\nand the strictly physico-chemical views of fermentation? It is quite\r\npossible that the living _Torula_ may excite fermentation in sugar,\r\nbecause it constantly produces, as an essential part of its vital\r\nmanifestations, some substance which acts upon the sugar, just as the\r\nsynaptase acts upon the amygdalin. Or it may be, that, without the\r\nformation of any such special substance, the physical condition of the\r\nliving tissue of the yeast plant is sufficient to effect that small\r\ndisturbance of the equilibrium of the particles of the sugar, which\r\nLavoisier thought sufficient to effect its decomposition.\r\n\r\nPlatinum in a very fine state of division--known as platinum black, or\r\n_noir de platine_--has the very singular property of causing alcohol to\r\nchange into acetic acid with great rapidity. The vinegar plant, which is\r\nclosely allied to the yeast plant, has a similar effect upon dilute\r\nalcohol, causing it to absorb the oxygen of the air, and become converted\r\ninto vinegar; and Liebig's eminent opponent, Pasteur, who has done so\r\nmuch for the theory and the practice of vinegar-making, himself suggests\r\nthat in this case--\r\n\r\n\"La cause du phénomène physique qui accompagne la vie de la plante réside\r\ndans un état physique propre, analogue à celui du noir de platine. Mais\r\nil est essentiel de remarquer que cet état physique de la plante est\r\nétroitement lié avec la vie de cette plante.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Etudes sur les Mycodermes_, Comptes-Rendus, liv., 1862.]\r\n\r\nNow, if the vinegar plant gives rise to the oxidation of alcohol, on\r\naccount of its merely physical constitution, it is at any rate possible\r\nthat the physical constitution of the yeast plant may exert a decomposing\r\ninfluence on sugar.\r\n\r\nBut, without presuming to discuss a question which leads us into the very\r\narcana of chemistry, the present state of speculation upon the _modus\r\noperandi_ of the yeast plant in producing fermentation is represented, on\r\nthe one hand, by the Stahlian doctrine, supported by Liebig, according to\r\nwhich the atoms of the sugar are shaken into new combinations either\r\ndirectly by the _Toruloe_, or indirectly, by some substance formed by\r\nthem; and, on the other hand, by the Thénardian doctrine, supported by\r\nPasteur, according to which the yeast plant assimilates part of the\r\nsugar, and, in so doing, disturbs the rest, and determines its resolution\r\ninto the products of fermentation. Perhaps the two views are not so much\r\nopposed as they seem at first sight to be.\r\n\r\nBut the interest which attaches to the influence of the yeast plants upon\r\nthe medium in which they live and grow does not arise solely from its\r\nbearing upon the theory of fermentation. So long ago as 1838, Turpin\r\ncompared the _Toruloe_ to the ultimate elements of the tissues of animals\r\nand plants--\"Les organes élémentaires de leurs tissus, comparables aux\r\npetits végétaux des levures ordinaires, sont aussi les décompositeurs des\r\nsubstances qui les environnent.\"\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same time, and, probably, equally guided by his study of\r\nyeast, Schwann was engaged in those remarkable investigations into the\r\nform and development of the ultimate structural elements of the tissues\r\nof animals, which led him to recognise their fundamental identity with\r\nthe ultimate structural elements of vegetable organisms.\r\n\r\nThe yeast plant is a mere sac, or \"cell,\" containing a semi-fluid matter,\r\nand Schwann's microscopic analysis resolved all living organisms, in the\r\nlong run, into an aggregation of such sacs or cells, variously modified;\r\nand tended to show, that all, whatever their ultimate complication, begin\r\ntheir existence in the condition of such simple cells.\r\n\r\nIn his famous \"Mikroskopische Untersuchungen\" Schwann speaks of _Torula_\r\nas a \"cell\"; and, in a remarkable note to the passage in which he refers\r\nto the yeast plant, Schwann says:--\r\n\r\n\"I have been unable to avoid mentioning fermentation, because it is the\r\nmost fully and exactly known operation of cells, and represents, in the\r\nsimplest fashion, the process which is repeated by every cell of the\r\nliving body.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, Schwann conceives that every cell of the living body\r\nexerts an influence on the matter which surrounds and permeates it,\r\nanalogous to that which a _Torula_ exerts on the saccharine solution by\r\nwhich it is bathed. A wonderfully suggestive thought, opening up views of\r\nthe nature of the chemical processes of the living body, which have\r\nhardly yet received all the development of which they are capable.\r\n\r\nKant defined the special peculiarity of the living body to be that the\r\nparts exist for the sake of the whole and the whole for the sake of the\r\nparts. But when Turpin and Schwann resolved the living body into an\r\naggregation of quasi-independent cells, each, like a _Torula_, leading\r\nits own life and having its own laws of growth and development, the\r\naggregation being dominated and kept working towards a definite end only\r\nby a certain harmony among these units, or by the superaddition of a\r\ncontrolling apparatus, such as a nervous system, this conception ceased\r\nto be tenable. The cell lives for its own sake, as well as for the sake\r\nof the whole organism; and the cells which float in the blood, live at\r\nits expense, and profoundly modify it, are almost as much independent\r\norganisms as the _Toruloe_ which float in beer-wort.\r\n\r\nSchwann burdened his enunciation of the \"cell theory\" with two false\r\nsuppositions; the one, that the structures he called \"nucleus\"[6] and\r\n\"cell-wall\" are essential to a cell; the other, that cells are usually\r\nformed independently of other cells; but, in 1839, it was a vast and\r\nclear gain to arrive at the conception, that the vital functions of all\r\nthe higher animals and plants are the resultant of the forces inherent in\r\nthe innumerable minute cells of which they are composed, and that each of\r\nthem is, itself, an equivalent of one of the lowest and simplest of\r\nindependent living beings--the _Torula_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Later investigations have thrown an entirely new light upon\r\nthe structure and the functional importance of the nucleus; and have\r\nproved that Schwann did not over-estimate its importance. 1894.]\r\n\r\nFrom purely morphological investigations, Turpin and Schwann, as we have\r\nseen, arrived at the notion of the fundamental unity of structure of\r\nliving beings. And, before long, the researches of chemists gradually led\r\nup to the conception of the fundamental unity of their composition.\r\n\r\nSo far back as 1803, Thénard pointed out, in most distinct terms, the\r\nimportant fact that yeast contains a nitrogenous \"animal\" substance; and\r\nthat such a substance is contained in all ferments. Before him, Fabroni\r\nand Fourcroy speak of the \"vegeto-animal\" matter of yeast. In 1844 Mulder\r\nendeavoured to demonstrate that a peculiar substance, which he called\r\n\"protein,\" was essentially characteristic of living matter.\r\n\r\nIn 1846, Payen writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Enfin, une loi sans exception me semble apparaître dans les faits\r\nnombreux que j'ai observés et conduire à envisager sous un nouveau jour\r\nla vie végétale; si je ne m'abuse, tout ce que dans les tissus végétaux\r\nla vue directe où amplifiée nous permet de discerner sous la forme de\r\ncellules et de vaisseaux, ne représente autre chose que les enveloppes\r\nprotectrices, les réservoirs et les conduits, à l'aide desquels les corps\r\nanimés qui les secrètent et les façonnent, se logent, puisent et\r\ncharrient leurs aliments, déposent et isolent les matières excrétées.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\r\n\r\n\"Afin de compléter aujourd'hui l'énoncé du fait général, je rappellerai\r\nque les corps, doué des fonctions accomplies dans les tissus des plantes,\r\nsont formés des éléments qui constituent, en proportion peu variable, les\r\norganismes animaux; qu'ainsi l'on est conduit à reconnaître une immense\r\nunité de composition élémentaire dans tous les corps vivants de la\r\nnature.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Mém. sur les Développements des Végétaux, &c.--_Mém.\r\nPrésentées_. ix. 1846.]\r\n\r\nIn the year (1846) in which these remarkable passages were published, the\r\neminent German botanist, Von Mohl invented the word \"protoplasm,\" as a\r\nname for one portion of those nitrogenous contents of the cells of living\r\nplants, the close chemical resemblance of which to the essential\r\nconstituents of living animals is so strongly indicated by Payen. And\r\nthrough the twenty-five years that have passed, since the matter of life\r\nwas first called protoplasm, a host of investigators, among whom Cohn,\r\nMax Schulze, and Kühne must be named as leaders, have accumulated\r\nevidence, morphological, physiological, and chemical, in favour of that\r\n\"immense unité de composition élémentaire dans tous les corps vivants de\r\nla nature,\" into which Payen had, so early, a clear insight.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1850, Cohn wrote, apparently without any knowledge of what\r\nPayen had said before him:--\r\n\r\n\"The protoplasm of the botanist, and the contractile substance and\r\nsarcode of the zoologist, must be, if not identical, yet in a high degree\r\nanalogous substances. Hence, from this point of view, the difference\r\nbetween animals and plants consists in this; that, in the latter, the\r\ncontractile substance, as a primordial utricle, is enclosed within an\r\ninert cellulose membrane, which permits it only to exhibit an internal\r\nmotion, expressed by the phenomena of rotation and circulation, while, in\r\nthe former, it is not so enclosed. The protoplasm in the form of the\r\nprimordial utricle is, as it were, the animal element in the plant, but\r\nwhich is imprisoned, and only becomes free in the animal; or, to strip\r\noff the metaphor which obscures simple thought, the energy of organic\r\nvitality which is manifested in movement is especially exhibited by a\r\nnitrogenous contractile substance, which in plants is limited and\r\nfettered by an inert membrane, in animals not so.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Cohn, \"Ueber Protococcus pluvialis,\" in the _Nova Acta_ for\r\n1850.]\r\n\r\nIn 1868, thinking that an untechnical statement of the views current\r\namong the leaders of biological science might be interesting to the\r\ngeneral public, I gave a lecture embodying them in Edinburgh. Those who\r\nhave not made the mistake of attempting to approach biology, either by\r\nthe high _à priori_ road of mere philosophical speculation, or by the\r\nmere low _à posteriori_ lane offered by the tube of a microscope, but\r\nhave taken the trouble to become acquainted with well-ascertained facts\r\nand with their history, will not need to be told that in what I had to\r\nsay \"as regards protoplasm\" in my lecture \"On the Physical Basis of Life\"\r\n(Vol. I. of these Essays, p. 130), there was nothing new; and, as I hope,\r\nnothing that the present state of knowledge does not justify us in\r\nbelieving to be true. Under these circumstances, my surprise may be\r\nimagined, when I found, that the mere statement of facts and of views,\r\nlong familiar to me as part of the common scientific property of\r\nContinental workers, raised a sort of storm in this country, not only by\r\nexciting the wrath of unscientific persons whose pet prejudices they\r\nseemed to touch, but by giving rise to quite superfluous explosions on\r\nthe part of some who should have been better informed.\r\n\r\nDr. Stirling, for example, made my essay the subject of a special\r\ncritical lecture,[9] which I have read with much interest, though, I\r\nconfess, the meaning of much of it remains as dark to me as does the\r\n\"Secret of Hegel\" after Dr. Stirling's elaborate revelation of it. Dr.\r\nStirling's method of dealing with the subject is peculiar. \"Protoplasm\"\r\nis a question of history, so far as it is a name; of fact, so far as it\r\nis a thing. Dr. Stirling, has not taken the trouble to refer to the\r\noriginal authorities for his history, which is consequently a travesty;\r\nand still less has he concerned himself with looking at the facts, but\r\ncontents himself with taking them also at second-hand. A most amusing\r\nexample of this fashion of dealing with scientific statements is\r\nfurnished by Dr. Stirling's remarks upon my account of the protoplasm of\r\nthe nettle hair. That account was drawn up from careful and often-\r\nrepeated observation of the facts. Dr. Stirling thinks he is offering a\r\nvalid criticism, when he says that my valued friend Professor Stricker\r\ngives a somewhat different statement about protoplasm. But why in the\r\nworld did not this distinguished Hegelian look at a nettle hair for\r\nhimself, before venturing to speak about the matter at all? Why trouble\r\nhimself about what either Stricker or I say, when any tyro can see the\r\nfacts for himself, if he is provided with those not rare articles, a\r\nnettle and a microscope? But I suppose this would have been\r\n\"_Aufklärung_\"--a recurrence to the base common-sense philosophy of the\r\neighteenth century, which liked to see before it believed, and to\r\nunderstand before it criticised Dr. Stirling winds up his paper with the\r\nfollowing paragraph:--\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Subsequently published under the title of \"As regards\r\nProtoplasm.\"]\r\n\r\n\"In short, the whole position of Mr. Huxley, (1) that all organisms\r\nconsist alike of the same life-matter, (2) which life-matter is, for its\r\npart, due only to chemistry, must be pronounced untenable--nor less\r\nuntenable (3) the materialism he would found on it.\"\r\n\r\nThe paragraph contains three distinct assertions concerning my views, and\r\njust the same number of utter misrepresentations of them. That which I\r\nhave numbered (1) turns on the ambiguity of the word \"same,\" for a\r\ndiscussion of which I would refer Dr. Stirling to a great hero of\r\n\"_Aufklärung_\" Archbishop Whately; statement number (2) is, in my\r\njudgment, absurd, and certainly I have never said anything resembling it;\r\nwhile, as to number (3), one great object of my essay was to show that\r\nwhat is called \"materialism\" has no sound philosophical basis!\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the study of yeast has led investigators face to face\r\nwith problems of immense interest in pure chemistry, and in animal and\r\nvegetable morphology. Its physiology is not less rich in subjects for\r\ninquiry. Take, for example, the singular fact that yeast will increase\r\nindefinitely when grown in the dark, in water containing only tartrate of\r\nammonia a small percentage of mineral salts and sugar. Out of these\r\nmaterials the _Toruloe_ will manufacture nitrogenous protoplasm,\r\ncellulose, and fatty matters, in any quantity, although they are wholly\r\ndeprived of those rays of the sun, the influence of which is essential to\r\nthe growth of ordinary plants. There has been a great deal of speculation\r\nlately, as to how the living organisms buried beneath two or three\r\nthousand fathoms of water, and therefore in all probability almost\r\ndeprived of light, live. If any of them possess the same powers as yeast\r\n(and the same capacity for living without light is exhibited by some\r\nother fungi) there would seem to be no difficulty about the matter.\r\n\r\nOf the pathological bearings of the study of yeast, and other such\r\norganisms, I have spoken elsewhere. It is certain that, in some animals,\r\ndevastating epidemics are caused by fungi of low order--similar to those\r\nof which _Torula_ is a sort of offshoot. It is certain that such diseases\r\nare propagated by contagion and infection, in just the same way as\r\nordinary contagious and infectious diseases are propagated. Of course, it\r\ndoes not follow from this, that all contagious and infectious diseases\r\nare caused by organisms of as definite and independent a character as the\r\n_Torula_; but, I think, it does follow that it is prudent and wise to\r\nsatisfy one's self in each particular case, that the \"germ theory\" cannot\r\nand will not explain the facts, before having recourse to hypotheses\r\nwhich have no equal support from analogy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE FORMATION OF COAL\r\n\r\n[1870]\r\n\r\nThe lumps of coal in a coal-scuttle very often have a roughly cubical\r\nform. If one of them be picked out and examined with a little care, it\r\nwill be found that its six sides are not exactly alike. Two opposite\r\nsides are comparatively smooth and shining, while the other four are much\r\nrougher, and are marked by lines which run parallel with the smooth\r\nsides. The coal readily splits along these lines, and the split surfaces\r\nthus formed are parallel with the smooth faces. In other words, there is\r\na sort of rough and incomplete stratification in the lump of coal, as if\r\nit were a book, the leaves of which had stuck together very closely.\r\n\r\nSometimes the faces along which the coal splits are not smooth, but\r\nexhibit a thin layer of dull, charred-looking substance, which is known\r\nas \"mineral charcoal.\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally one of the faces of a lump of coal will present impressions,\r\nwhich are obviously those of the stem, or leaves, of a plant; but though\r\nhard mineral masses of pyrites, and even fine mud, may occur here and\r\nthere, neither sand nor pebbles are met with.\r\n\r\nWhen the coal burns, the chief ultimate products of its combustion are\r\ncarbonic acid, water, and ammoniacal products, which escape up the\r\nchimney; and a greater or less amount of residual earthy salts, which\r\ntake the form of ash. These products are, to a great extent, such as\r\nwould result from the burning of so much wood.\r\n\r\nThese properties of coal may be made out without any very refined\r\nappliances, but the microscope reveals something more. Black and opaque\r\nas ordinary coal is, slices of it become transparent if they are cemented\r\nin Canada balsam, and rubbed down very thin, in the ordinary way of\r\nmaking thin sections of non-transparent bodies. But as the thin slices,\r\nmade in this way, are very apt to crack and break into fragments, it is\r\nbetter to employ marine glue as the cementing material. By the use of\r\nthis substance, slices of considerable size and of extreme thinness and\r\ntransparency may be obtained.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: My assistant in the Museum of Practical Geology, Mr. Newton,\r\ninvented this excellent method of obtaining thin slices of coal.]\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose two such slices to be prepared from our lump of coal--\r\none parallel with the bedding, the other perpendicular to it; and let us\r\ncall the one the horizontal, and the other the vertical, section. The\r\nhorizontal section will present more or less rounded yellow patches and\r\nstreaks, scattered irregularly through the dark brown, or blackish,\r\nground substance; while the vertical section will exhibit mere elongated\r\nbars and granules of the same yellow materials, disposed in lines which\r\ncorrespond, roughly, with the general direction of the bedding of the\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\nThis is the microscopic structure of an ordinary piece of coal. But if a\r\ngreat series of coals, from different localities and seams, or even from\r\ndifferent parts of the same seam, be examined, this structure will be\r\nfound to vary in two directions. In the anthracitic, or stone-coals,\r\nwhich burn like coke, the yellow matter diminishes, and the ground\r\nsubstance becomes more predominant, blacker, and more opaque, until it\r\nbecomes impossible to grind a section thin enough to be translucent;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, in such as the \"Better-Bed\" coal of the\r\nneighbourhood of Bradford, which burns with much flame, the coal is of a\r\nfar lighter, colour and transparent sections are very easily obtained. In\r\nthe browner parts of this coal, sharp eyes will readily detect multitudes\r\nof curious little coin-shaped bodies, of a yellowish brown colour,\r\nembedded in the dark brown ground substance. On the average, these little\r\nbrown bodies may have a diameter of about one-twentieth of an inch. They\r\nlie with their flat surfaces nearly parallel with the two smooth faces of\r\nthe block in which they are contained; and, on one side of each, there\r\nmay be discerned a figure, consisting of three straight linear marks,\r\nwhich radiate from the centre of the disk, but do not quite reach its\r\ncircumference. In the horizontal section these disks are often converted\r\ninto more or less complete rings; while in the vertical sections they\r\nappear like thick hoops, the sides of which have been pressed together.\r\nThe disks are, therefore, flattened bags; and favourable sections show\r\nthat the three-rayed marking is the expression of three clefts, which\r\npenetrate one wall of the bag.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the bags are sometimes closely approximated; but, when the\r\nbags are less flattened, their cavities are, usually, filled with\r\nnumerous, irregularly rounded, hollow bodies, having the same kind of\r\nwall as the large ones, but not more than one seven-hundredth of an inch\r\nin diameter.\r\n\r\nIn favourable specimens, again, almost the whole ground substance appears\r\nto be made up of similar bodies--more or less carbonized or blackened--\r\nand, in these, there can be no doubt that, with the exception of patches\r\nof mineral charcoal, here and there, the whole mass of the coal is made\r\nup of an accumulation of the larger and of the smaller sacs.\r\n\r\nBut, in one and the same slice, every transition can be observed from\r\nthis structure to that which has been described as characteristic of\r\nordinary coal. The latter appears to rise out of the former, by the\r\nbreaking-up and increasing carbonization of the larger and the smaller\r\nsacs. And, in the anthracitic coals, this process appears to have gone to\r\nsuch a length, as to destroy the original structure altogether, and to\r\nreplace it by a completely carbonized substance.\r\n\r\nThus coal may be said, speaking broadly, to be composed of two\r\nconstituents: firstly, mineral charcoal; and, secondly, coal proper. The\r\nnature of the mineral charcoal has long since been determined. Its\r\nstructure shows it to consist of the remains of the stems and leaves of\r\nplants, reduced a little more than their carbon. Again, some of the coal\r\nis made up of the crushed and flattened bark, or outer coat, of the stems\r\nof plants, the inner wood of which has completely decayed away. But what\r\nI may term the \"saccular matter\" of the coal, which, either in its\r\nprimary or in its degraded form constitutes by far the greater part of\r\nall the bituminous coals I have examined, is certainly not mineral\r\ncharcoal; nor is its structure that of any stem or leaf. Hence its real\r\nnature is at first by no means apparent, and has been the subject of much\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nThe first person who threw any light upon the problem, as far as I have\r\nbeen able to discover, was the well-known geologist, Professor Morris. It\r\nis now thirty-four years since he carefully described and figured the\r\ncoin-shaped bodies, or larger sacs, as I have called them, in a note\r\nappended to the famous paper \"On the Coalbrookdale Coal-Field,\" published\r\nat that time, by the present President of the Geological Society, Mr.\r\nPrestwich. With much sagacity, Professor Morris divined the real nature\r\nof these bodies, and boldly affirmed them to be the spore-cases of a\r\nplant allied to the living club-mosses.\r\n\r\nBut discovery sometimes makes a long halt; and it is only a few years\r\nsince Mr. Carruthers determined the plant (or rather one of the plants)\r\nwhich produces these spore-cases, by finding the discoidal sacs still\r\nadherent to the leaves of the fossilized cone which produced them. He\r\ngave the name of _Flemingites gracilis_ to the plant of which the cones\r\nform a part. The branches and stem of this plant are not yet certainly\r\nknown, but there is no sort of doubt that it was closely allied to the\r\n_Lepidodendron_, the remains of which abound in the coal formation. The\r\n_Lepidodendra_ were shrubs and trees which put one more in mind of an\r\n_Araucaria_ than of any other familiar plant; and the ends of the\r\nfruiting branches were terminated by cones, or catkins, somewhat like the\r\nbodies so named in a fir, or a willow. These conical fruits, however, did\r\nnot produce seeds; but the leaves of which they were composed bore upon\r\ntheir surfaces sacs full of spores or sporangia, such as those one sees\r\non the under surface of a bracken leaf. Now, it is these sporangia of the\r\nLepidodendroid plant _Flemingites_ which were identified by Mr.\r\nCarruthers with the free sporangia described by Professor Morris, which\r\nare the same as the large sacs of which I have spoken. And, more than\r\nthis, there is no doubt that the small sacs are the spores, which were\r\noriginally contained in the sporangia.\r\n\r\nThe living club-mosses are, for the most part, insignificant and creeping\r\nherbs, which, superficially, very closely resemble true mosses, and none\r\nof them reach more than two or three feet in height. But, in their\r\nessential structure, they very closely resemble the earliest\r\nLepidodendroid trees of the coal: their stems and leaves are similar; so\r\nare their cones; and no less like are the sporangia and spores; while\r\neven in their size, the spores of the _Lepidodendron_ and those of the\r\nexisting _Lycopodium_, or club-moss, very closely approach one another.\r\n\r\nThus, the singular conclusion is forced upon us, that the greater and the\r\nsmaller sacs of the \"Better-Bed\" and other coals, in which the primitive\r\nstructure is well preserved, are simply the sporangia and spores of\r\ncertain plants, many of which were closely allied to the existing club-\r\nmosses. And if, as I believe, it can be demonstrated that ordinary coal\r\nis nothing but \"saccular\" coal which has undergone a certain amount of\r\nthat alteration which, if continued, would convert it into anthracite;\r\nthen, the conclusion is obvious, that the great mass of the coal we burn\r\nis the result of the accumulation of the spores and spore-cases of\r\nplants, other parts of which have furnished the carbonized stems and the\r\nmineral charcoal, or have left their impressions on the surfaces of the\r\nlayer.\r\n\r\nOf the multitudinous speculations which, at various times, have been\r\nentertained respecting the origin and mode of formation of coal, several\r\nappear to be negatived, and put out of court, by the structural facts the\r\nsignificance of which I have endeavoured to explain. These facts, for\r\nexample, do not permit us to suppose that coal is an accumulation of\r\npeaty matter, as some have held.\r\n\r\nAgain, the late Professor Quekett was one of the first observers who gave\r\na correct description of what I have termed the \"saccular\" structure of\r\ncoal; and, rightly perceiving that this structure was something quite\r\ndifferent from that of any known plant, he imagined that it proceeded\r\nfrom some extinct vegetable organism which was peculiarly abundant\r\namongst the coal-forming plants. But this explanation is at once shown to\r\nbe untenable when the smaller and the larger sacs are proved to be spores\r\nor sporangia.\r\n\r\nSome, once more, have imagined that coal was of submarine origin; and\r\nthough the notion is amply and easily refuted by other considerations, it\r\nmay be worth while to remark, that it is impossible to comprehend how a\r\nmass of light and resinous spores should have reached the bottom of the\r\nsea, or should have stopped in that position if they had got there.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is proper to remark that I do not presume to suggest\r\nthat all coal must needs have the same structure; or that there may not\r\nbe coals in which the proportions of wood and spores, or spore-cases, are\r\nvery different from those which I have examined. All I repeat is, that\r\nnone of the coals which have come under my notice have enabled me to\r\nobserve such a difference. But, according to Principal Dawson, who has so\r\nsedulously examined the fossil remains of plants in North America, it is\r\notherwise with the vast accumulations of coal in that country.\r\n\r\n\"The true coal,\" says Dr. Dawson, \"consists principally of the flattened\r\nbark of Sigillarioid and other trees, intermixed with leaves of Ferns and\r\n_Cordaites_, and other herbaceous _débris_, and with fragments of decayed\r\nwood, constituting 'mineral charcoal,' all these materials having\r\nmanifestly alike grown and accumulated where we find them.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Acadian Geology_, 2nd edition, p. 135.]\r\n\r\nWhen I had the pleasure of seeing Principal Dawson in London last summer,\r\nI showed him my sections of coal, and begged him to re-examine some of\r\nthe American coals on his return to Canada, with an eye to the presence\r\nof spores and sporangia, such as I was able to show him in our English\r\nand Scotch coals. He has been good enough to do so; and in a letter dated\r\nSeptember 26th, 1870, he informs me that--\r\n\r\n\"Indications of spore-cases are rare, except in certain coarse shaly\r\ncoals and portions of coals, and in the roofs of the seams. The most\r\nmarked case I have yet met with is the shaly coal referred to as\r\ncontaining _Sporangites_ in my paper on the conditions of accumulation of\r\ncoal (\"Journal of the Geological Society,\" vol. xxii. pp. 115, 139, and\r\n165). The purer coals certainly consist principally of cubical tissues\r\nwith some true woody matter, and the spore-cases, &c., are chiefly in the\r\ncoarse and shaly layers. This is my old doctrine in my two papers in the\r\n\"Journal of the Geological Society,\" and I see nothing to modify it. Your\r\nobservations, however, make it probable that the frequent _clear spots_\r\nin the cannels are spore-cases.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Dawson's results are the more remarkable, as the numerous specimens\r\nof British coal, from various localities, which I have examined, tell one\r\ntale as to the predominance of the spore and sporangium element in their\r\ncomposition; and as it is exactly in the finest and purest coals, such as\r\nthe \"Better-Bed\" coal of Lowmoor, that the spores and sporangia obviously\r\nconstitute almost the entire mass of the deposit.\r\n\r\nCoal, such as that which has been described, is always found in sheets,\r\nor \"seams,\" varying from a fraction of an inch to many feet in thickness,\r\nenclosed in the substance of the earth at very various depths, between\r\nbeds of rock of different kinds. As a rule, every seam of coal rests upon\r\na thicker, or thinner, bed of clay, which is known as \"under-clay.\" These\r\nalternations of beds of coal, clay, and rock may be repeated many times,\r\nand are known as the \"coal-measures\"; and in some regions, as in South\r\nWales and in Nova Scotia, the coal-measures attain a thickness of twelve\r\nor fourteen thousand feet, and enclose eighty or a hundred seams of coal,\r\neach with its under-clay, and separated from those above and below by\r\nbeds of sandstone and shale.\r\n\r\nThe position of the beds which constitute the coal-measures is infinitely\r\ndiverse. Sometimes they are tilted up vertically, sometimes they are\r\nhorizontal, sometimes curved into great basins; sometimes they come to\r\nthe surface, sometimes they are covered up by thousands of feet of rock.\r\nBut, whatever their present position, there is abundant and conclusive\r\nevidence that every under-clay was once a surface soil. Not only do\r\ncarbonized root-fibres frequently abound in these under-clays; but the\r\nstools of trees, the trunks of which are broken off and confounded with\r\nthe bed of coal, have been repeatedly found passing into radiating roots,\r\nstill embedded in the under-clay. On many parts of the coast of England,\r\nwhat are commonly known as \"submarine forests\" are to be seen at low\r\nwater. They consist, for the most part, of short stools of oak, beech,\r\nand fir-trees, still fixed by their long roots in the bed of blue clay in\r\nwhich they originally grew. If one of these submarine forest beds should\r\nbe gradually depressed and covered up by new deposits, it would present\r\njust the same characters as an under-clay of the coal, if the\r\n_Sigillaria_ and _Lepidodendron_ of the ancient world were substituted\r\nfor the oak, or the beech, of our own times.\r\n\r\nIn a tropical forest, at the present day, the trunks of fallen trees, and\r\nthe stools of such trees as may have been broken by the violence of\r\nstorms, remain entire for but a short time. Contrary to what might be\r\nexpected, the dense wood of the tree decays, and suffers from the ravages\r\nof insects, more swiftly than the bark. And the traveller, setting his\r\nfoot on a prostrate trunk, finds that it is a mere shell, which breaks\r\nunder his weight, and lands his foot amidst the insects, or the reptiles,\r\nwhich have sought food or refuge within.\r\n\r\nThe trees of the coal forests present parallel conditions. When the\r\nfallen trunks which have entered into the composition of the bed of coal\r\nare identifiable, they are mere double shells of bark, flattened together\r\nin consequence of the destruction of the woody core; and Sir Charles\r\nLyell and Principal Dawson discovered, in the hollow stools of coal trees\r\nof Nova Scotia, the remains of snails, millipedes, and salamander-like\r\ncreatures, embedded in a deposit of a different character from that which\r\nsurrounded the exterior of the trees. Thus, in endeavouring to comprehend\r\nthe formation of a seam of coal, we must try to picture to ourselves a\r\nthick forest, formed for the most part of trees like gigantic club-\r\nmosses, mares'-tails, and tree-ferns, with here and there some that had\r\nmore resemblance to our existing yews and fir-trees. We must suppose\r\nthat, as the seasons rolled by, the plants grew and developed their\r\nspores and seeds; that they shed these in enormous quantities, which\r\naccumulated on the ground beneath; and that, every now and then, they\r\nadded a dead frond or leaf; or, at longer intervals, a rotten branch, or\r\na dead trunk, to the mass.\r\n\r\nA certain proportion of the spores and seeds no doubt fulfilled their\r\nobvious function, and, carried by the wind to unoccupied regions,\r\nextended the limits of the forest; many might be washed away by rain into\r\nstreams, and be lost; but a large portion must have remained, to\r\naccumulate like beech-mast, or acorns, beneath the trees of a modern\r\nforest.\r\n\r\nBut, in this case it may be asked, why does not our English coal consist\r\nof stems and leaves to a much greater extent than it does? What is the\r\nreason of the predominance of the spores and spore-cases in it?\r\n\r\nA ready answer to this question is afforded by the study of a living\r\nfull-grown club-moss. Shake it upon a piece of paper, and it emits a\r\ncloud of fine dust, which falls over the paper, and is the well-known\r\nLycopodium powder. Now this powder used to be, and I believe still is,\r\nemployed for two objects which seem, at first sight, to have no\r\nparticular connection with one another. It is, or was, employed in making\r\nlightning, and in making pills. The coats of the spores contain so much\r\nresinous matter, that a pinch of Lycopodium powder, thrown through the\r\nflame of a candle, burns with an instantaneous flash, which has long done\r\nduty for lightning on the stage. And the same character makes it a\r\ncapital coating for pills; for the resinous powder prevents the drug from\r\nbeing wetted by the saliva, and thus bars the nauseous flavour from the\r\nsensitive papilla; of the tongue.\r\n\r\nBut this resinous matter, which lies in the walls of the spores and\r\nsporangia, is a substance not easily altered by air and water, and hence\r\ntends to preserve these bodies, just as the bituminized cerecloth\r\npreserves an Egyptian mummy; while, on the other hand, the merely woody\r\nstem and leaves tend to rot, as fast as the wood of the mummy's coffin\r\nhas rotted. Thus the mixed heap of spores, leaves, and stems in the coal-\r\nforest would be persistently searched by the long-continued action of air\r\nand rain; the leaves and stems would gradually be reduced to little but\r\ntheir carbon, or, in other words, to the condition of mineral charcoal in\r\nwhich we find them; while the spores and sporangia remained as a\r\ncomparatively unaltered and compact residuum.\r\n\r\nThere is, indeed, tolerably clear evidence that the coal must, under some\r\ncircumstances, have been converted into a substance hard enough to be\r\nrolled into pebbles, while it yet lay at the surface of the earth; for in\r\nsome seams of coal, the courses of rivulets, which must have been living\r\nwater, while the stratum in which their remains are found was still at\r\nthe surface, have been observed to contain rolled pebbles of the very\r\ncoal through which the stream has cut its way.\r\n\r\nThe structural facts are such as to leave no alternative but to adopt the\r\nview of the origin of such coal as I have described, which has just been\r\nstated; but, happily, the process is not without analogy at the present\r\nday. I possess a specimen of what is called \"white coal\" from Australia.\r\nIt is an inflammable material, burning with a bright flame and having\r\nmuch the consistence and appearance of oat-cake, which, I am informed\r\ncovers a considerable area. It consists, almost entirely, of a compacted\r\nmass of spores and spore-cases. But the fine particles of blown sand\r\nwhich are scattered through it, show that it must have accumulated,\r\nsubaërially, upon the surface of a soil covered by a forest of\r\ncryptogamous plants, probably tree-ferns.\r\n\r\nAs regards this important point of the subaërial region of coal, I am\r\nglad to find myself in entire accordance with Principal Dawson, who bases\r\nhis conclusions upon other, but no less forcible, considerations. In a\r\npassage, which is the continuation of that already cited, he writes:--\r\n\r\n\"(3) The microscopical structure and chemical composition of the beds of\r\ncannel coal and earthy bitumen, and of the more highly bituminous and\r\ncarbonaceous shale, show them to have been of the nature of the fine\r\nvegetable mud which accumulates in the ponds and shallow lakes of modern\r\nswamps. When such tine vegetable sediment is mixed, as is often the case,\r\nwith clay, it becomes similar to the bituminous limestone and calcareo-\r\nbituminous shales of the coal-measures. (4) A few of the under-clays,\r\nwhich support beds of coal, are of the nature of the vegetable mud above\r\nreferred to; but the greater part are argillo-arenaceous in composition,\r\nwith little vegetable matter, and bleached by the drainage from them of\r\nwater containing the products of vegetable decay. They are, in short,\r\nloamy or clay soils, and must have been sufficiently above water to admit\r\nof drainage. The absence of sulphurets, and the occurrence of carbonate\r\nof iron in connection with them, prove that, when they existed as soils,\r\nrain-water, and not sea-water, percolated them. (5) The coal and the\r\nfossil forests present many evidences of subaërial conditions. Most of\r\nthe erect and prostrate trees had become hollow shells of bark before\r\nthey were finally embedded, and their wood had broken into cubical pieces\r\nof mineral charcoal. Land-snails and galley-worms (_Xylobius_) crept into\r\nthem, and they became dens, or traps, for reptiles. Large quantities of\r\nmineral charcoal occur on the surface of all the large beds of coal. None\r\nof these appearances could have been produced by subaqueous action. (6)\r\nThough the roots of the _Sigillaria_ bear more resemblance to the\r\nrhizomes of certain aquatic plants; yet, structurally, they are\r\nabsolutely identical with the roots of Cycads, which the stems also\r\nresemble. Further, the _Sigillarioe_ grew on the same soils which\r\nsupported Conifers, _Lepidodendra_, _Cordaites_, and Ferns-plants which\r\ncould not have grown in water. Again, with the exception perhaps of some\r\n_Pinnularioe_, and _Asterophyllites_, there is a remarkable absence from\r\nthe coal measures of any form of properly aquatic vegetation. (7) The\r\noccurrence of marine, or brackish-water animals, in the roofs of coal-\r\nbeds, or even in the coal itself, affords no evidence of subaqueous\r\naccumulation, since the same thing occurs in the case of modern submarine\r\nforests. For these and other reasons, some of which are more fully stated\r\nin the papers already referred to, while I admit that the areas of coal\r\naccumulation were frequently submerged, I must maintain that the true\r\ncoal is a subaërial accumulation by vegetable growth on soils, wet and\r\nswampy it is true, but not submerged.\"\r\n\r\nI am almost disposed to doubt whether it is necessary to make the\r\nconcession of \"wet and swampy\"; otherwise, there is nothing that I know\r\nof to be said against this excellent conspectus of the reasons for\r\nbelieving in the subaërial origin of coal.\r\n\r\nBut the coal accumulated upon the area covered by one of the great\r\nforests of the carboniferous epoch would in course of time, have been\r\nwasted away by the small, but constant, wear and tear of rain and streams\r\nhad the land which supported it remained at the same level, or been\r\ngradually raised to a greater elevation. And, no doubt, as much coal as\r\nnow exists has been destroyed, after its formation, in this way. What are\r\nnow known as coal districts owe their importance to the fact that they\r\nwere areas of slow depression, during a greater or less portion of the\r\ncarboniferous epoch; and that, in virtue of this circumstance, Mother\r\nEarth was enabled to cover up her vegetable treasures, and preserve them\r\nfrom destruction.\r\n\r\nWherever a coal-field now exists, there must formerly have been free\r\naccess for a great river, or for a shallow sea, bearing sediment in the\r\nshape of sand and mud. When the coal-forest area became slowly depressed,\r\nthe waters must have spread over it, and have deposited their burden upon\r\nthe surface of the bed of coal, in the form of layers, which are now\r\nconverted into shale, or sandstone. Then followed a period of rest, in\r\nwhich the superincumbent shallow waters became completely filled up, and\r\nfinally replaced, by fine mud, which settled down into a new under-clay,\r\nand furnished the soil for a fresh forest growth. This flourished, and\r\nheaped up its spores and wood into coal, until the stage of slow\r\ndepression recommenced. And, in some localities, as I have mentioned, the\r\nprocess was repeated until the first of the alternating beds had sunk to\r\nnear three miles below its original level at the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn reflecting on the statement, thus briefly made, of the main facts\r\nconnected with the origin of the coal formed during the carboniferous\r\nepoch, two or three considerations suggest themselves.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the great phantom of geological time rises before the\r\nstudent of this, as of all other, fragments of the history of our earth--\r\nspringing irrepressibly out of the facts, like the Djin from the jar\r\nwhich the fishermen so incautiously opened; and like the Djin again,\r\nbeing vaporous, shifting, and indefinable, but unmistakably gigantic.\r\nHowever modest the bases of one's calculation may be, the minimum of time\r\nassignable to the coal period remains something stupendous.\r\n\r\nPrincipal Dawson is the last person likely to be guilty of exaggeration\r\nin this matter, and it will be well to consider what he has to say about\r\nit:--\r\n\r\n\"The rate of accumulation of coal was very slow. The climate of the\r\nperiod, in the northern temperate zone, was of such a character that the\r\ntrue conifers show rings of growth, not larger, nor much less distinct,\r\nthan those of many of their modern congeners. The _Sigillarioe_ and\r\n_Calamites_ were not, as often supposed, composed wholly, or even\r\nprincipally, of lax and soft tissues, or necessarily short-lived. The\r\nformer had, it is true, a very thick inner bark; but their dense woody\r\naxis, their thick and nearly imperishable outer bark, and their scanty\r\nand rigid foliage, would indicate no very rapid growth or decay. In the\r\ncase of the _Sigillarioe_, the variations in the leaf-scars in different\r\nparts of the trunk, the intercalation of new ridges at the surface\r\nrepresenting that of new woody wedges in the axis, the transverse marks\r\nleft by the stages of upward growth, all indicate that several years must\r\nhave been required for the growth of stems of moderate size. The enormous\r\nroots of these trees, and the condition of the coal-swamps, must have\r\nexempted them from the danger of being overthrown by violence. They\r\nprobably fell in successive generations from natural decay; and making\r\nevery allowance for other materials, we may safely assert that every foot\r\nof thickness of pure bituminous coal implies the quiet growth and fall of\r\nat least fifty generations of _Sigillarioe_, and therefore an undisturbed\r\ncondition of forest growth enduring through many centuries. Further,\r\nthere is evidence that an immense amount of loose parenchymatous tissue,\r\nand even of wood, perished by decay, and we do not know to what extent\r\neven the most durable tissues may have disappeared in this way; so that,\r\nin many coal-seams, we may have only a very small part of the vegetable\r\nmatter produced.\"\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly the force of these reflections is not diminished when the\r\nbituminous coal, as in Britain, consists of accumulated spores and spore-\r\ncases, rather than of stems. But, suppose we adopt Principal Dawson's\r\nassumption, that one foot of coal represents fifty generations of coal\r\nplants; and, further, make the moderate supposition that each generation\r\nof coal plants took ten years to come to maturity--then, each foot-\r\nthickness of coal represents five hundred years. The superimposed beds of\r\ncoal in one coal-field may amount to a thickness of fifty or sixty feet,\r\nand therefore the coal alone, in that field, represents 500 x 50 = 25,000\r\nyears. But the actual coal is but an insignificant portion of the total\r\ndeposit, which, as has been seen, may amount to between two and three\r\nmiles of vertical thickness. Suppose it be 12,000 feet--which is 240\r\ntimes the thickness of the actual coal--is there any reason why we should\r\nbelieve it may not have taken 240 times as long to form? I know of none.\r\nBut, in this case, the time which the coal-field represents would be\r\n25,000 x 240 = 6,000,000 years. As affording a definite chronology, of\r\ncourse such calculations as these are of no value; but they have much use\r\nin fixing one's attention upon a possible minimum. A man may be puzzled\r\nif he is asked how long Rome took a-building; but he is proverbially safe\r\nif he affirms it not to have been built in a day; and our geological\r\ncalculations are all, at present, pretty much on that footing.\r\n\r\nA second consideration which the study of the coal brings prominently\r\nbefore the mind of any one who is familiar with palaeontology is, that the\r\ncoal Flora, viewed in relation to the enormous period of time which it\r\nlasted, and to the still vaster period which has elapsed since it\r\nflourished, underwent little change while it endured, and in its peculiar\r\ncharacters, differs strangely little from that which at present exist.\r\n\r\nThe same species of plants are to be met with throughout the whole\r\nthickness of a coal-field, and the youngest are not sensibly different\r\nfrom the oldest. But more than this. Notwithstanding that the\r\ncarboniferous period is separated from us by more than the whole time\r\nrepresented by the secondary and tertiary formations, the great types of\r\nvegetation were as distinct then as now. The structure of the modern\r\nclub-moss furnishes a complete explanation of the fossil remains of the\r\n_Lepidodendra_, and the fronds of some of the ancient ferns are hard to\r\ndistinguish from existing ones. At the same time, it must be remembered,\r\nthat there is nowhere in the world, at present, any _forest_ which bears\r\nmore than a rough analogy with a coal-forest. The types may remain, but\r\nthe details of their form, their relative proportions, their associates,\r\nare all altered. And the tree-fern forest of Tasmania, or New Zealand,\r\ngives one only a faint and remote image of the vegetation of the ancient\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nOnce more, an invariably-recurring lesson of geological history, at\r\nwhatever point its study is taken up: the lesson of the almost infinite\r\nslowness of the modification of living forms. The lines of the pedigrees\r\nof living things break off almost before they begin to converge.\r\n\r\nFinally, yet another curious consideration. Let us suppose that one of\r\nthe stupid, salamander-like Labyrinthodonts, which pottered, with much\r\nbelly and little leg, like Falstaff in his old age, among the coal-\r\nforests, could have had thinking power enough in his small brain to\r\nreflect upon the showers of spores which kept on falling through years\r\nand centuries, while perhaps not one in ten million fulfilled its\r\napparent purpose, and reproduced the organism which gave it birth: surely\r\nhe might have been excused for moralizing upon the thoughtless and wanton\r\nextravagance which Nature displayed in her operations.\r\n\r\nBut we have the advantage over our shovel-headed predecessor--or possibly\r\nancestor--and can perceive that a certain vein of thrift runs through\r\nthis apparent prodigality. Nature is never in a hurry, and seems to have\r\nhad always before her eyes the adage, \"Keep a thing long enough, and you\r\nwill find a use for it.\" She has kept her beds of coal many millions of\r\nyears without being able to find much use for them; she has sent them\r\ndown beneath the sea, and the sea-beasts could make nothing of them; she\r\nhas raised them up into dry land, and laid the black veins bare, and\r\nstill, for ages and ages, there was no living thing on the face of the\r\nearth that could see any sort of value in them; and it was only the other\r\nday, so to speak, that she turned a new creature out of her workshop, who\r\nby degrees acquired sufficient wits to make a fire, and then to discover\r\nthat the black rock would burn.\r\n\r\nI suppose that nineteen hundred years ago, when Julius Caesar was good\r\nenough to deal with Britain as we have dealt with New Zealand, the\r\nprimaeval Briton, blue with cold and woad, may have known that the strange\r\nblack stone, of which he found lumps here and there in his wanderings,\r\nwould burn, and so help to warm his body and cook his food. Saxon, Dane,\r\nand Norman swarmed into the land. The English people grew into a powerful\r\nnation, and Nature still waited for a full return of the capital she had\r\ninvested in the ancient club-mosses. The eighteenth century arrived, and\r\nwith it James Watt. The brain of that man was the spore out of which was\r\ndeveloped the modern steam-engine, and all the prodigious trees and\r\nbranches of modern industry which have grown out of this. But coal is as\r\nmuch an essential condition of this growth and development as carbonic\r\nacid is for that of a club-moss. Wanting coal, we could not have smelted\r\nthe iron needed to make our engines, nor have worked our engines when we\r\nhad got them. But take away the engines, and the great towns of Yorkshire\r\nand Lancashire vanish like a dream. Manufactures give place to\r\nagriculture and pasture, and not ten men can live where now ten thousand\r\nare amply supported.\r\n\r\nThus, all this abundant wealth of money and of vivid life is Nature's\r\ninterest upon her investment in club-mosses, and the like, so long ago.\r\nBut what becomes of the coal which is burnt in yielding this interest?\r\nHeat comes out of it, light comes out of it; and if we could gather\r\ntogether all that goes up the chimney, and all that remains in the grate\r\nof a thoroughly-burnt coal-fire, we should find ourselves in possession\r\nof a quantity of carbonic acid, water, ammonia, and mineral matters,\r\nexactly equal in weight to the coal. But these are the very matters with\r\nwhich Nature supplied the club-mosses which made the coal She is paid\r\nback principal and interest at the same time; and she straightway invests\r\nthe carbonic acid, the water, and the ammonia in new forms of life,\r\nfeeding with them the plants that now live. Thrifty Nature! Surely no\r\nprodigal, but most notable of housekeepers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE BORDER TERRITORY BETWEEN THE ANIMAL AND THE VEGETABLE KINGDOMS\r\n\r\n[1876]\r\n\r\nIn the whole history of science there is nothing more remarkable than the\r\nrapidity of the growth of biological knowledge within the last half-\r\ncentury, and the extent of the modification which has thereby been\r\neffected in some of the fundamental conceptions of the naturalist.\r\n\r\nIn the second edition of the \"Règne Animal,\" published in 1828, Cuvier\r\ndevotes a special section to the \"Division of Organised Beings into\r\nAnimals and Vegetables,\" in which the question is treated with that\r\ncomprehensiveness of knowledge and clear critical judgment which\r\ncharacterise his writings, and justify us in regarding them as\r\nrepresentative expressions of the most extensive, if not the profoundest,\r\nknowledge of his time. He tells us that living beings have been\r\nsubdivided from the earliest times into _animated beings_, which possess\r\nsense and motion, and _inanimated beings_, which are devoid of these\r\nfunctions and simply vegetate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the roots of plants direct themselves towards moisture, and\r\ntheir leaves towards air and light,--although the parts of some plants\r\nexhibit oscillating movements without any perceptible cause, and the\r\nleaves of others retract when touched,--yet none of these movements\r\njustify the ascription to plants of perception or of will. From the\r\nmobility of animals, Cuvier, with his characteristic partiality for\r\nteleological reasoning, deduces the necessity of the existence in them of\r\nan alimentary cavity, or reservoir of food, whence their nutrition may be\r\ndrawn by the vessels, which are a sort of internal roots; and, in the\r\npresence of this alimentary cavity, he naturally sees the primary and the\r\nmost important distinction between animals and plants.\r\n\r\nFollowing out his teleological argument, Cuvier remarks that the\r\norganisation of this cavity and its appurtenances must needs vary\r\naccording to the nature of the aliment, and the operations which it has\r\nto undergo, before it can be converted into substances fitted for\r\nabsorption; while the atmosphere and the earth supply plants with juices\r\nready prepared, and which can be absorbed immediately. As the animal body\r\nrequired to be independent of heat and of the atmosphere, there were no\r\nmeans by which the motion of its fluids could be produced by internal\r\ncauses. Hence arose the second great distinctive character of animals, or\r\nthe circulatory system, which is less important than the digestive, since\r\nit was unnecessary, and therefore is absent, in the more simple animals.\r\n\r\nAnimals further needed muscles for locomotion and nerves for sensibility.\r\nHence, says Cuvier, it was necessary that the chemical composition of the\r\nanimal body should be more complicated than that of the plant; and it is\r\nso, inasmuch as an additional substance, nitrogen, enters into it as an\r\nessential element; while, in plants, nitrogen is only accidentally joined\r\nwith he three other fundamental constituents of organic beings--carbon,\r\nhydrogen, and oxygen. Indeed, he afterwards affirms that nitrogen is\r\npeculiar to animals; and herein he places the third distinction between\r\nthe animal and the plant. The soil and the atmosphere supply plants with\r\nwater, composed of hydrogen and oxygen; air, consisting of nitrogen and\r\noxygen; and carbonic acid, containing carbon and oxygen. They retain the\r\nhydrogen and the carbon, exhale the superfluous oxygen, and absorb little\r\nor no nitrogen. The essential character of vegetable life is the\r\nexhalation of oxygen, which is effected through the agency of light.\r\nAnimals, on the contrary, derive their nourishment either directly or\r\nindirectly from plants. They get rid of the superfluous hydrogen and\r\ncarbon, and accumulate nitrogen. The relations of plants and animals to\r\nthe atmosphere are therefore inverse. The plant withdraws water and\r\ncarbonic acid from the atmosphere, the animal contributes both to it.\r\nRespiration--that is, the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of\r\ncarbonic acid--is the specially animal function of animals, and\r\nconstitutes their fourth distinctive character.\r\n\r\nThus wrote Cuvier in 1828. But, in the fourth and fifth decades of this\r\ncentury, the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science\r\nhas ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern\r\nmicroscope to the investigation of organic structure; by the introduction\r\nof exact and easily manageable methods of conducting the chemical\r\nanalysis of organic compounds; and finally, by the employment of\r\ninstruments of precision for the measurement of the physical forces which\r\nare at work in the living economy.\r\n\r\nThat the semi-fluid contents (which we now term protoplasm) of the cells\r\nof certain plants, such as the _Charoe_ are in constant and regular\r\nmotion, was made out by Bonaventura Corti a century ago; but the fact,\r\nimportant as it was, fell into oblivion, and had to be rediscovered by\r\nTreviranus in 1807. Robert Brown noted the more complex motions of the\r\nprotoplasm in the cells of _Tradescantia_ in 1831; and now such movements\r\nof the living substance of plants are well known to be some of the most\r\nwidely-prevalent phenomena of vegetable life.\r\n\r\nAgardh, and other of the botanists of Cuvier's generation, who occupied\r\nthemselves with the lower plants, had observed that, under particular\r\ncircumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water-weeds were set\r\nfree, and moved about with considerable velocity, and with all the\r\nappearances of spontaneity, as locomotive bodies, which, from their\r\nsimilarity to animals of simple organisation, were called \"zoospores.\"\r\nEven as late as 1845, however, a botanist of Schleiden's eminence dealt\r\nvery sceptically with these statements; and his scepticism was the more\r\njustified, since Ehrenberg, in his elaborate and comprehensive work on\r\nthe _Infusoria_, had declared the greater number of what are now\r\nrecognised as locomotive plants to be animals.\r\n\r\nAt the present day, innumerable plants and free plant cells are known to\r\npass the whole or part of their lives in an actively locomotive\r\ncondition, in no wise distinguishable from that of one of the simpler\r\nanimals; and, while in this condition, their movements are, to all\r\nappearance, as spontaneous--as much the product of volition--as those of\r\nsuch animals.\r\n\r\nHence the teleological argument for Cuvier's first diagnostic character--\r\nthe presence in animals of an alimentary cavity, or internal pocket, in\r\nwhich they can carry about their nutriment--has broken down, so far, at\r\nleast, as his mode of stating it goes. And, with the advance of\r\nmicroscopic anatomy, the universality of the fact itself among animals\r\nhas ceased to be predicable. Many animals of even complex structure,\r\nwhich live parasitically within others, are wholly devoid of an\r\nalimentary cavity. Their food is provided for them, not only ready\r\ncooked, but ready digested, and the alimentary canal, become superfluous,\r\nhas disappeared. Again, the males of most Rotifers have no digestive\r\napparatus; as a German naturalist has remarked, they devote themselves\r\nentirely to the \"Minnedienst,\" and are to be reckoned among the few\r\nrealisations of the Byronic ideal of a lover. Finally, amidst the lowest\r\nforms of animal life, the speck of gelatinous protoplasm, which\r\nconstitutes the whole body, has no permanent digestive cavity or mouth,\r\nbut takes in its food anywhere; and digests, so to speak, all over its\r\nbody. But although Cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the\r\nplant will not stand a strict test, it remains one of the most constant\r\nof the distinctive characters of animals. And, if we substitute for the\r\npossession of an alimentary cavity, the power of taking solid nutriment\r\ninto the body and there digesting it, the definition so changed will\r\ncover all animals except certain parasites, and the few and exceptional\r\ncases of non-parasitic animals which do not feed at all. On the other\r\nhand, the definition thus amended will exclude all ordinary vegetable\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\nCuvier himself practically gives up his second distinctive mark when he\r\nadmits that it is wanting in the simpler animals.\r\n\r\nThe third distinction is based on a completely erroneous conception of\r\nthe chemical differences and resemblances between the constituents of\r\nanimal and vegetable organisms, for which Cuvier is not responsible, as\r\nit was current among contemporary chemists. It is now established that\r\nnitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living\r\nmatter; and that the latter is, chemically speaking, just as complicated\r\nas the former. Starchy substances, cellulose and sugar, once supposed to\r\nbe exclusively confined to plants, are now known to be regular and normal\r\nproducts of animals. Amylaceous and saccharine substances are largely\r\nmanufactured, even by the highest animals; cellulose is widespread as a\r\nconstituent of the skeletons of the lower animals; and it is probable\r\nthat amyloid substances are universally present in the animal organism,\r\nthough not in the precise form of starch.\r\n\r\nMoreover, although it remains true that there is an inverse relation\r\nbetween the green plant in sunshine and the animal, in so far as, under\r\nthese circumstances, the green plant decomposes carbonic acid and exhales\r\noxygen, while the animal absorbs oxygen and exhales carbonic acid; yet,\r\nthe exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the\r\nphysiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy\r\nof attempting to draw any general distinction between animals and\r\nvegetables on this ground. In fact, the difference vanishes with the\r\nsunshine, even in the case of the green plant; which, in the dark,\r\nabsorbs oxygen and gives out carbonic acid like any animal.[1] On the\r\nother hand, those plants, such as the fungi, which contain no chlorophyll\r\nand are not green, are always, so far as respiration is concerned, in the\r\nexact position of animals. They absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is every reason to believe that living plants, like\r\nliving animals, always respire, and, in respiring, absorb oxygen and give\r\noff carbonic acid; but, that in green plants exposed to daylight or to\r\nthe electric light, the quantity of oxygen evolved in consequence of the\r\ndecomposition of carbonic acid by a special apparatus which green plants\r\npossess exceeds that absorbed in the concurrent respiratory process.]\r\n\r\nThus, by the progress of knowledge, Cuvier's fourth distinction between\r\nthe animal and the plant has been as completely invalidated as the third\r\nand second; and even the first can be retained only in a modified form\r\nand subject to exceptions.\r\n\r\nBut has the advance of biology simply tended to break down old\r\ndistinctions, without establishing new ones?\r\n\r\nWith a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this\r\nquestion is undoubtedly in the affirmative. The famous researches of\r\nSchwann and Schleiden in 1837 and the following years, founded the modern\r\nscience of histology, or that branch of anatomy which deals with the\r\nultimate visible structure of organisms, as revealed by the microscope;\r\nand, from that day to this, the rapid improvement of methods of\r\ninvestigation, and the energy of a host of accurate observers, have given\r\ngreater and greater breadth and firmness to Schwann's great\r\ngeneralisation, that a fundamental unity of structure obtains in animals\r\nand plants; and that, however diverse may be the fabrics, or _tissues_,\r\nof which their bodies are composed, all these varied structures result\r\nfrom the metamorphosis of morphological units (termed _cells_, in a more\r\ngeneral sense than that in which the word \"cells\" was at first employed),\r\nwhich are not only similar in animals and in plants respectively, but\r\npresent a close resemblance, when those of animals and those of plants\r\nare compared together.\r\n\r\nThe contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion, has\r\nnot only been discovered to exist far more widely among plants than was\r\nformerly imagined; but, in plants, the act of contraction has been found\r\nto be accompanied, as Dr. Burdon Sanderson's interesting investigations\r\nhave shown, by a disturbance of the electrical state of the contractile\r\nsubstance, comparable to that which was found by Du Bois Reymond to be a\r\nconcomitant of the activity of ordinary muscle in animals.\r\n\r\nAgain, I know of no test by which the reaction of the leaves of the\r\nSundew and of other plants to stimuli, so fully and carefully studied by\r\nMr. Darwin, can be distinguished from those acts of contraction following\r\nupon stimuli, which are called \"reflex\" in animals.\r\n\r\nOn each lobe of the bilobed leaf of Venus's fly-trap (_Dionoea\r\nmuscipula_) are three delicate filaments which stand out at right angle\r\nfrom the surface of the leaf. Touch one of them with the end of a fine\r\nhuman hair and the lobes of the leaf instantly close together[2] in\r\nvirtue of an act of contraction of part of their substance, just as the\r\nbody of a snail contracts into its shell when one of its \"horns\" is\r\nirritated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Darwin, _Insectivorous Plants_, p. 289.]\r\n\r\nThe reflex action of the snail is the result of the presence of a nervous\r\nsystem in the animal. A molecular change takes place in the nerve of the\r\ntentacle, is propagated to the muscles by which the body is retracted,\r\nand causing them to contract, the act of retraction is brought about. Of\r\ncourse the similarity of the acts does not necessarily involve the\r\nconclusion that the mechanism by which they are effected is the same; but\r\nit suggests a suspicion of their identity which needs careful testing.\r\n\r\nThe results of recent inquiries into the structure of the nervous system\r\nof animals converge towards the conclusion that the nerve fibres, which\r\nwe have hitherto regarded as ultimate elements of nervous tissue, are not\r\nsuch, but are simply the visible aggregations of vastly more attenuated\r\nfilaments, the diameter of which dwindles down to the limits of our\r\npresent microscopic vision, greatly as these have been extended by modern\r\nimprovements of the microscope; and that a nerve is, in its essence,\r\nnothing but a linear tract of specially modified protoplasm between two\r\npoints of an organism--one of which is able to affect the other by means\r\nof the communication so established. Hence, it is conceivable that even\r\nthe simplest living being may possess a nervous system. And the question\r\nwhether plants are provided with a nervous system or not, thus acquires a\r\nnew aspect, and presents the histologist and physiologist with a problem\r\nof extreme difficulty, which must be attacked from a new point of view\r\nand by the aid of methods which have yet to be invented.\r\n\r\nThus it must be admitted that plants may be contractile and locomotive;\r\nthat, while locomotive, their movements may have as much appearance of\r\nspontaneity as those of the lowest animals; and that many exhibit\r\nactions, comparable to those which are brought about by the agency of a\r\nnervous system in animals. And it must be allowed to be possible that\r\nfurther research may reveal the existence of something comparable to a\r\nnervous system in plants. So that I know not where we can hope to find\r\nany absolute distinction between animals and plants, unless we return to\r\ntheir mode of nutrition, and inquire whether certain differences of a\r\nmore occult character than those imagined to exist by Cuvier, and which\r\ncertainly hold good for the vast majority of animals and plants, are of\r\nuniversal application.\r\n\r\nA bean may be supplied with water in which salts of ammonia and certain\r\nother mineral salts are dissolved in due proportion; with atmospheric air\r\ncontaining its ordinary minute dose of carbonic acid; and with nothing\r\nelse but sunlight and heat. Under these circumstances, unnatural as they\r\nare, with proper management, the bean will thrust forth its radicle and\r\nits plumule; the former will grow down into roots, the latter grow up\r\ninto the stem and leaves of a vigorous bean-plant; and this plant will,\r\nin due time, flower and produce its crop of beans, just as if it were\r\ngrown in the garden or in the field.\r\n\r\nThe weight of the nitrogenous protein compounds, of the oily, starchy,\r\nsaccharine and woody substances contained in the full-grown plant and its\r\nseeds, will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances\r\ncontained in the bean from which it sprang. But nothing has been supplied\r\nto the bean save water, carbonic acid, ammonia, potash, lime, iron, and\r\nthe like, in combination with phosphoric, sulphuric, and other acids.\r\nNeither protein, nor fat, nor starch, nor sugar, nor any substance in the\r\nslightest degree resembling them, has formed part of the food of the\r\nbean. But the weights of the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nphosphorus, sulphur, and other elementary bodies contained in the bean-\r\nplant, and in the seeds which it produces, are exactly equivalent to the\r\nweights of the same elements which have disappeared from the materials\r\nsupplied to the bean during its growth. Whence it follows that the bean\r\nhas taken in only the raw materials of its fabric, and has manufactured\r\nthem into bean-stuffs.\r\n\r\nThe bean has been able to perform this great chemical feat by the help of\r\nits green colouring matter, or chlorophyll; for it is only the green\r\nparts of the plant which, under the influence of sunlight, have the\r\nmarvellous power of decomposing carbonic acid, setting free the oxygen\r\nand laying hold of the carbon which it contains. In fact, the bean\r\nobtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance\r\nfrom two distinct sources; the watery solution, in which its roots are\r\nplunged, contains nitrogen but no carbon; the air, to which the leaves\r\nare exposed, contains carbon, but its nitrogen is in the state of a free\r\ngas, in which condition the bean can make no use of it;[3] and the\r\nchlorophyll[4] is the apparatus by which the carbon is extracted from the\r\natmospheric carbonic acid--the leaves being the chief laboratories in\r\nwhich this operation is effected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I purposely assume that the air with which the bean is\r\nsupplied in the case stated contains no ammoniacal salts.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The recent researches of Pringsheim have raised a host of\r\nquestions as to the exact share taken by chlorophyll in the chemical\r\noperations which are effected by the green parts of plants. It may be\r\nthat the chlorophyll is only a constant concomitant of the actual\r\ndeoxidising apparatus.]\r\n\r\nThe great majority of conspicuous plants are, as everybody knows, green;\r\nand this arises from the abundance of their chlorophyll. The few which\r\ncontain no chlorophyll and are colourless, are unable to extract the\r\ncarbon which they require from atmospheric carbonic acid, and lead a\r\nparasitic existence upon other plants; but it by no means follows, often\r\nas the statement has been repeated, that the manufacturing power of\r\nplants depends on their chlorophyll, and its interaction with the rays of\r\nthe sun. On the contrary, it is easily demonstrated, as Pasteur first\r\nproved, that the lowest fungi, devoid of chlorophyll, or of any\r\nsubstitute for it, as they are, nevertheless possess the characteristic\r\nmanufacturing powers of plants in a very high degree. Only it is\r\nnecessary that they should be supplied with a different kind of raw\r\nmaterial; as they cannot extract carbon from carbonic acid, they must be\r\nfurnished with something else that contains carbon. Tartaric acid is such\r\na substance; and if a single spore of the commonest and most troublesome\r\nof moulds--_Penicillium_--be sown in a saucerful of water, in which\r\ntartrate of ammonia, with a small percentage of phosphates and sulphates\r\nis contained, and kept warm, whether in the dark or exposed to light, it\r\nwill, in a short time, give rise to a thick crust of mould, which\r\ncontains many million times the weight of the original spore, in protein\r\ncompounds and cellulose. Thus we have a very wide basis of fact for the\r\ngeneralisation that plants are essentially characterised by their\r\nmanufacturing capacity--by their power of working up mere mineral matters\r\ninto complex organic compounds.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, there is a no less wide foundation for the generalisation\r\nthat animals, as Cuvier puts it, depend directly or indirectly upon\r\nplants for the materials of their bodies; that is, either they are\r\nherbivorous, or they eat other animals which are herbivorous.\r\n\r\nBut for what constituents of their bodies are animals thus dependent upon\r\nplants? Certainly not for their horny matter; nor for chondrin, the\r\nproximate chemical element of cartilage; nor for gelatine; nor for\r\nsyntonin, the constituent of muscle; nor for their nervous or biliary\r\nsubstances; nor for their amyloid matters; nor, necessarily, for their\r\nfats.\r\n\r\nIt can be experimentally demonstrated that animals can make these for\r\nthemselves. But that which they cannot make, but must, in all known\r\ncases, obtain directly or indirectly from plants, is the peculiar\r\nnitrogenous matter, protein. Thus the plant is the ideal _prolétaire_ of\r\nthe living world, the worker who produces; the animal, the ideal\r\naristocrat, who mostly occupies himself in consuming, after the manner of\r\nthat noble representative of the line of Zähdarm, whose epitaph is\r\nwritten in \"Sartor Resartus.\"\r\n\r\nHere is our last hope of finding a sharp line of demarcation between\r\nplants and animals; for, as I have already hinted, there is a border\r\nterritory between the two kingdoms, a sort of no-man's-land, the\r\ninhabitants of which certainly cannot be discriminated and brought to\r\ntheir proper allegiance in any other way.\r\n\r\nSome months ago, Professor Tyndall asked me to examine a drop of infusion\r\nof hay, placed under an excellent and powerful microscope, and to tell\r\nhim what I thought some organisms visible in it were. I looked and\r\nobserved, in the first place, multitudes of _Bacteria_ moving about with\r\ntheir ordinary intermittent spasmodic wriggles. As to the vegetable\r\nnature of these there is now no doubt. Not only does the close\r\nresemblance of the _Bacteria_ to unquestionable plants, such as the\r\n_Oscillatorioe_ and the lower forms of _Fungi_, justify this conclusion,\r\nbut the manufacturing test settles the question at once. It is only\r\nneedful to add a minute drop of fluid containing _Bacteria_, to water in\r\nwhich tartrate, phosphate, and sulphate of ammonia are dissolved; and, in\r\na very short space of time, the clear fluid becomes milky by reason of\r\ntheir prodigious multiplication, which, of course, implies the\r\nmanufacture of living Bacterium-stuff out of these merely saline matters.\r\n\r\nBut other active organisms, very much larger than the _Bacteria_,\r\nattaining in fact the comparatively gigantic dimensions of 1/3000 of an\r\ninch or more, incessantly crossed the field of view. Each of these had a\r\nbody shaped like a pear, the small end being slightly incurved and\r\nproduced into a long curved filament, or _cilium_, of extreme tenuity.\r\nBehind this, from the concave side of the incurvation, proceeded another\r\nlong cilium, so delicate as to be discernible only by the use of the\r\nhighest powers and careful management of the light. In the centre of the\r\npear-shaped body a clear round space could occasionally be discerned, but\r\nnot always; and careful watching showed that this clear vacuity appeared\r\ngradually, and then shut up and disappeared suddenly, at regular\r\nintervals. Such a structure is of common occurrence among the lowest\r\nplants and animals, and is known as a _contractile vacuole_.\r\n\r\nThe little creature thus described sometimes propelled itself with great\r\nactivity, with a curious rolling motion, by the lashing of the front\r\ncilium, while the second cilium trailed behind; sometimes it anchored\r\nitself by the hinder cilium and was spun round by the working of the\r\nother, its motions resembling those of an anchor buoy in a heavy sea.\r\nSometimes, when two were in full career towards one another, each would\r\nappear dexterously to get out of the other's way; sometimes a crowd would\r\nassemble and jostle one another, with as much semblance of individual\r\neffort as a spectator on the Grands Mulets might observe with a telescope\r\namong the specks representing men in the valley of Chamounix.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle, though always surprising, was not new to me. So my reply\r\nto the question put to me was, that these organisms were what biologists\r\ncall _Monads_, and though they might be animals, it was also possible\r\nthat they might, like the _Bacteria_, be plants. My friend received my\r\nverdict with an expression which showed a sad want of respect for\r\nauthority. He would as soon believe that a sheep was a plant. Naturally\r\npiqued by this want of faith, I have thought a good deal over the matter;\r\nand, as I still rest in the lame conclusion I originally expressed, and\r\nmust even now confess that I cannot certainly say whether this creature\r\nis an animal or a plant, I think it may be well to state the grounds of\r\nmy hesitation at length. But, in the first place, in order that I may\r\nconveniently distinguish this \"Monad\" from the multitude of other things\r\nwhich go by the same designation, I must give it a name of its own. I\r\nthink (though, for reasons which need not be stated at present, I am not\r\nquite sure) that it is identical with the species _Monas lens_ as defined\r\nby the eminent French microscopist Dujardin, though his magnifying power\r\nwas probably insufficient to enable him to see that it is curiously like\r\na much larger form of monad which he has named _Heteromita_. I shall,\r\ntherefore, call it not _Monas_, but _Heteromita lens_.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to devote to my _Heteromita_ the prolonged study\r\nneedful to work out its whole history, which would involve weeks, or it\r\nmay be months, of unremitting attention. But I the less regret this\r\ncircumstance, as some remarkable observations recently published by\r\nMessrs. Dallinger and Drysdale[5] on certain Monads, relate, in part, to\r\na form so similar to my _Heteromita lens_, that the history of the one\r\nmay be used to illustrate that of the other. These most patient and\r\npainstaking observers, who employed the highest attainable powers of the\r\nmicroscope and, relieving one another, kept watch day and night over the\r\nsame individual monads, have been enabled to trace out the whole history\r\nof their _Heteromita_; which they found in infusions of the heads of\r\nfishes of the Cod tribe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"Researches in the Life-history of a Cercomonad: a Lesson in\r\nBiogenesis\"; and \"Further Researches in the Life-history of the Monads,\"\r\n--_Monthly Microscopical Journal_, 1873.]\r\n\r\nOf the four monads described and figured by these investigators, one, as\r\nI have said, very closely resembles _Heteromita lens_ in every\r\nparticular, except that it has a separately distinguishable central\r\nparticle or \"nucleus,\" which is not certainly to be made out in\r\n_Heteromita lens_; and that nothing is said by Messrs. Dallinger and\r\nDrysdale of the existence of a contractile vacuole in this monad, though\r\nthey describe it in another.\r\n\r\nTheir _Heteromita_, however, multiplied rapidly by fission. Sometimes a\r\ntransverse constriction appeared; the hinder half developed a new cilium,\r\nand the hinder cilium gradually split from its base to its free end,\r\nuntil it was divided into two; a process which, considering the fact that\r\nthis fine filament cannot be much more than 1/100000 of an inch in\r\ndiameter, is wonderful enough. The constriction of the body extended\r\ninwards until the two portions were united by a narrow isthmus; finally,\r\nthey separated and each swam away by itself, a complete _Heteromita_,\r\nprovided with its two cilia. Sometimes the constriction took a\r\nlongitudinal direction, with the same ultimate result. In each case the\r\nprocess occupied not more than six or seven minutes. At this rate, a\r\nsingle _Heteromita_ would give rise to a thousand like itself in the\r\ncourse of an hour, to about a million in two hours, and to a number\r\ngreater than the generally assumed number of human beings now living in\r\nthe world in three hours; or, if we give each _Heteromita_ an hour's\r\nenjoyment of individual existence, the same result will be obtained in\r\nabout a day. The apparent suddenness of the appearance of multitudes of\r\nsuch organisms as these in any nutritive fluid to which one obtains\r\naccess is thus easily explained.\r\n\r\nDuring these processes of multiplication by fission, the _Heteromita_\r\nremains active; but sometimes another mode of fission occurs. The body\r\nbecomes rounded and quiescent, or nearly so; and, while in this resting\r\nstate, divides into two portions, each of which is rapidly converted into\r\nan active _Heteromita_.\r\n\r\nA still more remarkable phenomenon is that kind of multiplication which\r\nis preceded by the union of two monads, by a process which is termed\r\n_conjugation_. Two active _Heteromitoe_ become applied to one another,\r\nand then slowly and gradually coalesce into one body. The two nuclei run\r\ninto one; and the mass resulting from the conjugation of the two\r\n_Heteromitoe_, thus fused together, has a triangular form. The two pairs\r\nof cilia are to be seen, for some time, at two of the angles, which\r\nanswer to the small ends of the conjoined monads; but they ultimately\r\nvanish, and the twin organism, in which all visible traces of\r\norganisation have disappeared, falls into a state of rest. Sudden wave-\r\nlike movements of its substance next occur; and, in a short time, the\r\napices of the triangular mass burst, and give exit to a dense yellowish,\r\nglairy fluid, filled with minute granules. This process, which, it will\r\nbe observed, involves the actual confluence and mixture of the substance\r\nof two distinct organisms, is effected in the space of about two hours.\r\n\r\nThe authors whom I quote say that they \"cannot express\" the excessive\r\nminuteness of the granules in question, and they estimate their diameter\r\nat less than 1/200000 of an inch. Under the highest powers of the\r\nmicroscope, at present applicable, such specks are hardly discernible.\r\nNevertheless, particles of this size are massive when compared to\r\nphysical molecules; whence there is no reason to doubt that each, small\r\nas it is, may have a molecular structure sufficiently complex to give\r\nrise to the phenomena of life. And, as a matter of fact, by patient\r\nwatching of the place at which these infinitesimal living particles were\r\ndischarged, our observers assured themselves of their growth and\r\ndevelopment into new monads. In about four hours from their being set\r\nfree, they had attained a sixth of the length of the parent, with the\r\ncharacteristic cilia, though at first they were quite motionless; and, in\r\nfour hours more, they had attained the dimensions and exhibited all the\r\nactivity of the adult. These inconceivably minute particles are therefore\r\nthe germs of the _Heteromita_; and from the dimensions of these germs it\r\nis easily shown that the body formed by conjugation may, at a low\r\nestimate, have given exit to thirty thousand of them; a result of a\r\nmatrimonial process whereby the contracting parties, without a metaphor,\r\n\"become one flesh,\" enough to make a Malthusian despair of the future of\r\nthe Universe.\r\n\r\nI am not aware that the investigators from whom I have borrowed this\r\nhistory have endeavoured to ascertain whether their monads take solid\r\nnutriment or not; so that though they help us very much to fill up the\r\nblanks in the history of my _Heteromita_, their observations throw no\r\nlight on the problem we are trying to solve--Is it an animal or is it a\r\nplant?\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly it is possible to bring forward very strong arguments in\r\nfavour of regarding _Heteromita_ as a plant.\r\n\r\nFor example, there is a Fungus, an obscure and almost microscopic mould,\r\ntermed _Peronospora infestans_. Like many other Fungi, the _Peronosporoe_\r\nare parasitic upon other plants; and this particular _Peronospora_\r\nhappens to have attained much notoriety and political importance, in a\r\nway not without a parallel in the career of notorious politicians,\r\nnamely, by reason of the frightful mischief it has done to mankind. For\r\nit is this _Fungus_ which is the cause of the potato disease; and,\r\ntherefore, _Peronospora infestans_ (doubtless of exclusively Saxon\r\norigin, though not accurately known to be so) brought about the Irish\r\nfamine. The plants afflicted with the malady are found to be infested by\r\na mould, consisting of fine tubular filaments, termed _hyphoe_, which\r\nburrow through the substance of the potato plant, and appropriate to\r\nthemselves the substance of their host; while, at the same time, directly\r\nor indirectly, they set up chemical changes by which even its woody\r\nframework becomes blackened, sodden, and withered.\r\n\r\nIn structure, however, the _Peronospora_ is as much a mould as the common\r\n_Penicillium_; and just as the _Penicillium_ multiplies by the breaking\r\nup of its hyphoe into separate rounded bodies, the spores; so, in the\r\n_Peronospora_, certain of the hyphoe grow out into the air through the\r\ninterstices of the superficial cells of the potato plant, and develop\r\nspores. Each of these hyphoe usually gives off several branches. The ends\r\nof the branches dilate and become closed sacs, which eventually drop off\r\nas spores. The spores falling on some part of the same potato plant, or\r\ncarried by the wind to another, may at once germinate, throwing out\r\ntubular prolongations which become hyphoe, and burrow into the substance\r\nof the plant attacked. But, more commonly, the contents of the spore\r\ndivide into six or eight separate portions. The coat of the spore gives\r\nway, and each portion then emerges as an independent organism, which has\r\nthe shape of a bean, rather narrower at one end than the other, convex on\r\none side, and depressed or concave on the opposite. From the depression,\r\ntwo long and delicate cilia proceed, one shorter than the other, and\r\ndirected forwards. Close to the origin of these cilia, in the substance\r\nof the body, is a regularly pulsating, contractile vacuole. The shorter\r\ncilium vibrates actively, and effects the locomotion of the organism,\r\nwhile the other trails behind; the whole body rolling on its axis with\r\nits pointed end forwards.\r\n\r\nThe eminent botanist, De Bary, who was not thinking of our problem, tells\r\nus, in describing the movements of these \"Zoospores,\" that, as they swim\r\nabout, \"Foreign bodies are carefully avoided, and the whole movement has\r\na deceptive likeness to the voluntary changes of place which are observed\r\nin microscopic animals.\"\r\n\r\nAfter swarming about in this way in the moisture on the surface of a leaf\r\nor stem (which, film though it may be, is an ocean to such a fish) for\r\nhalf an hour, more or less, the movement of the zoospore becomes slower,\r\nand is limited to a slow turning upon its axis, without change of place.\r\nIt then becomes quite quiet, the cilia disappear, it assumes a spherical\r\nform, and surrounds itself with a distinct, though delicate, membranous\r\ncoat. A protuberance then grows out from one side of the sphere, and\r\nrapidly increasing in length, assumes the character of a hypha. The\r\nlatter penetrates into the substance of the potato plant, either by\r\nentering a stomate, or by boring through the wall of an epidermic cell,\r\nand ramifies, as a mycelium, in the substance of the plant, destroying\r\nthe tissues with which it comes in contact. As these processes of\r\nmultiplication take place very rapidly, millions of spores are soon set\r\nfree from a single infested plant; and, from their minuteness, they are\r\nreadily transported by the gentlest breeze. Since, again, the zoospores\r\nset free from each spore, in virtue of their powers of locomotion,\r\nswiftly disperse themselves over the surface, it is no wonder that the\r\ninfection, once started, soon spreads from field to field, and extends\r\nits ravages over a whole country.\r\n\r\nHowever, it does not enter into my present plan to treat of the potato\r\ndisease, instructively as its history bears upon that of other epidemics;\r\nand I have selected the case of the _Peroganspora_ simply because it\r\naffords an example of an organism, which, in one stage of its existence,\r\nis truly a \"Monad,\" indistinguishable by any important character from our\r\n_Heteromita_, and extraordinarily like it in some respects. And yet this\r\n\"Monad\" can be traced, step by step, through the series of metamorphoses\r\nwhich I have described, until it assumes the features of an organism,\r\nwhich is as much a plant as is an oak or an elm.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would be possible to pursue the analogy farther. Under\r\ncertain circumstances, a process of conjugation takes place in the\r\n_Peronospora_. Two separate portions of its protoplasm become fused\r\ntogether, surround themselves with a thick coat and give rise to a sort\r\nof vegetable egg called an _oospore_. After a period of rest, the\r\ncontents of the oospore break up into a number of zoospores like those\r\nalready described, each of which, after a period of activity, germinates\r\nin the ordinary way. This process obviously corresponds with the\r\nconjugation and subsequent setting free of germs in the _Heteromita_.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said that the _Peronospora_ is, after all, a questionable\r\nsort of plant; that it seems to be wanting in the manufacturing power,\r\nselected as the main distinctive character of vegetable life; or, at any\r\nrate, that there is no proof that it does not get its protein matter\r\nready made from the potato plant.\r\n\r\nLet us, therefore, take a case which is not open to these objections.\r\n\r\nThere are some small plants known to botanists as members of the genus\r\n_Colcochaete_, which, without being truly parasitic, grow upon certain\r\nwater-weeds, as lichens grow upon trees. The little plant has the form of\r\nan elegant green star, the branching arms of which are divided into\r\ncells. Its greenness is due to its chlorophyll, and it undoubtedly has\r\nthe manufacturing power in full degree, decomposing carbonic acid and\r\nsetting oxygen free, under the influence of sunlight. But the\r\nprotoplasmic contents of some of the cells of which the plant is made up\r\noccasionally divide, by a method similar to that which effects the\r\ndivision of the contents of the _Peronospora_ spore; and the severed\r\nportions are then set free as active monad-like zoospores. Each is oval\r\nand is provided at one extremity with two long active cilia. Propelled by\r\nthese, it swims about for a longer or shorter time, but at length comes\r\nto a state of rest and gradually grows into a _Coleochaete_. Moreover, as\r\nin the _Peronospora_, conjugation may take place and result in an\r\noospore; the contents of which divide and are set free as monadiform\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nIf the whole history of the zoospores of _Peronospora_ and of\r\n_Coleochaete_ were unknown, they would undoubtedly be classed among\r\n\"Monads\" with the same right as _Heteromita_; why then may not\r\n_Heteromita_ be a plant, even though the cycle of forms through which it\r\npasses shows no terms quite so complex as those which occur in\r\n_Peronospora_ and _Coleochaete_? And, in fact, there are some green\r\norganisms, in every respect characteristically plants, such as\r\n_Chlamydomonas_, and the common _Volvox_, or so-called \"Globe\r\nanimalcule,\" which run through a cycle of forms of just the same simple\r\ncharacter as those of _Heteromita_.\r\n\r\nThe name of _Chlamydomonas_ is applied to certain microscopic green\r\nbodies, each of which consists of a protoplasmic central substance\r\ninvested by a structureless sac. The latter contains cellulose, as in\r\nordinary plants; and the chlorophyll which gives the green colour enables\r\nthe _Chlamydomonas_ to decompose carbonic acid and fix carbon as they do.\r\nTwo long cilia protrude through the cell-wall, and effect the rapid\r\nlocomotion of this \"monad,\" which, in all respects except its mobility,\r\nis characteristically a plant. Under ordinary circumstances, the\r\n_Chlamydomonas_ multiplies by simple fission, each splitting into two or\r\ninto four parts, which separate and become independent organisms.\r\nSometimes, however, the _Chlamydomonas_ divides into eight parts, each of\r\nwhich is provided with four instead of two cilia. These \"zoospores\"\r\nconjugate in pairs, and give rise to quiescent bodies, which multiply by\r\ndivision, find eventually pass into the active state.\r\n\r\nThus, so far as outward form and the general character of the cycle of\r\nmodifications, through which the organism passes in the course of its\r\nlife, are concerned, the resemblance between _Chlamydomonas_ and\r\n_Heteromita_ is of the closest description. And on the face of the matter\r\nthere is no ground for refusing to admit that _Heteromita_ may be related\r\nto _Chlamydomonas_, as the colourless fungus is to the green alga.\r\n_Volvox_ may be compared to a hollow sphere, the wall of which is made up\r\nof coherent Chlamydomonads; and which progresses with a rotating motion\r\neffected by the paddling of the multitudinous pairs of cilia which\r\nproject from its surface. Each _Volvox_-monad, moreover, possesses a red\r\npigment spot, like the simplest form of eye known among animals. The\r\nmethods of fissive multiplication and of conjugation observed in the\r\nmonads of this locomotive globe are essentially similar to those observed\r\nin _Chlamydomonas_; and, though a hard battle has been fought over it,\r\n_Volvox_ is now finally surrendered to the Botanists.\r\n\r\nThus there is really no reason why _Heteromita_ may not be a plant; and\r\nthis conclusion would be very satisfactory, if it were not equally easy\r\nto show that there is really no reason why it should not be an animal.\r\nFor there are numerous organisms presenting the closest resemblance to\r\n_Heteromita_, and, like it, grouped under the general name of \"Monads,\"\r\nwhich, nevertheless, can be observed to take in solid nutriment, and\r\nwhich, therefore, have a virtual, if not an actual, mouth and digestive\r\ncavity, and thus come under Cuvier's definition of an animal. Numerous\r\nforms of such animals have been described by Ehrenberg, Dujardin, H.\r\nJames Clark, and other writers on the _Infusoria_. Indeed, in another\r\ninfusion of hay in which my _Heteromita lens_ occurred, there were\r\ninnumerable such infusorial animalcules belonging to the well-known\r\nspecies _Colpoda cucullus_.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Excellently described by Stein, almost all of whose\r\nstatements I have verified.]\r\n\r\nFull-sized specimens of this animalcule attain a length of between 1/300\r\nor 1/400 of an inch, so that it may have ten times the length and a\r\nthousand times the mass of a _Heteromita_. In shape, it is not altogether\r\nunlike _Heteromita_. The small end, however, is not produced into one\r\nlong cilium, but the general surface of the body is covered with small\r\nactively vibrating ciliary organs, which are only longest at the small\r\nend. At the point which answers to that from which the two cilia arise in\r\n_Heteromita_, there is a conical depression, the mouth; and, in young\r\nspecimens, a tapering filament, which reminds one of the posterior cilium\r\nof _Heteromita_, projects from this region.\r\n\r\nThe body consists of a soft granular protoplasmic substance, the middle\r\nof which is occupied by a large oval mass called the \"nucleus\"; while, at\r\nits hinder end, is a \"contractile vacuole,\" conspicuous by its regular\r\nrhythmic appearances and disappearances. Obviously, although the\r\n_Colpoda_ is not a monad, it differs from one only in subordinate\r\ndetails. Moreover, under certain conditions, it becomes quiescent,\r\nincloses itself in a delicate case or _cyst_, and then divides into two,\r\nfour, or more portions, which are eventually set free and swim about as\r\nactive _Colpodoe_.\r\n\r\nBut this creature is an unmistakable animal, and full-sized _Colpodoe_\r\nmay be fed as easily as one feeds chickens. It is only needful to diffuse\r\nvery finely ground carmine through the water in which they live, and, in\r\na very short time, the bodies of the _Colpodoe_ are stuffed with the\r\ndeeply-coloured granules of the pigment.\r\n\r\nAnd if this were not sufficient evidence of the animality of _Colpoda_,\r\nthere comes the fact that it is even more similar to another well-known\r\nanimalcule, _Paramoecium_, than it is to a monad. But _Paramoecium_ is so\r\nhuge a creature compared with those hitherto discussed--it reaches 1/120\r\nof an inch or more in length--that there is no difficulty in making out\r\nits organisation in detail; and in proving that it is not only an animal,\r\nbut that it is an animal which possesses a somewhat complicated\r\norganisation. For example, the surface layer of its body is different in\r\nstructure from the deeper parts. There are two contractile vacuoles, from\r\neach of which radiates a system of vessel-like canals; and not only is\r\nthere a conical depression continuous with a tube, which serve as mouth\r\nand gullet, but the food ingested takes a definite course, and refuse is\r\nrejected from a definite region. Nothing is easier than to feed these\r\nanimals, and to watch the particles of indigo or carmine accumulate at\r\nthe lower end of the gullet. From this they gradually project, surrounded\r\nby a ball of water, which at length passes with a jerk, oddly simulating\r\na gulp, into the pulpy central substance of the body, there to circulate\r\nup one side and down the other, until its contents are digested and\r\nassimilated. Nevertheless, this complex animal multiplies by division, as\r\nthe monad does, and, like the monad, undergoes conjugation. It stands in\r\nthe same relation to _Heteromita_ on the animal side, as _Coleochaete_\r\ndoes on the plant side. Start from either, and such an insensible series\r\nof gradations leads to the monad that it is impossible to say at any\r\nstage of the progress where the line between the animal and the plant\r\nmust be drawn.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to think that certain organisms which pass through a\r\nmonad stage of existence, such as the _Myxomycetes_, are, at one time of\r\ntheir lives, dependent upon external sources for their protein matter, or\r\nare animals; and, at another period, manufacture it, or are plants. And\r\nseeing that the whole progress of modern investigation is in favour of\r\nthe doctrine of continuity, it is a fair and probable speculation--though\r\nonly a speculation--that, as there are some plants which can manufacture\r\nprotein out of such apparently intractable mineral matters as carbonic\r\nacid, water, nitrate of ammonia, metallic and earthy salts; while others\r\nneed to be supplied with their carbon and nitrogen in the somewhat less\r\nraw form of tartrate of ammonia and allied compounds; so there may be yet\r\nothers, as is possibly the case with the true parasitic plants, which can\r\nonly manage to put together materials still better prepared--still more\r\nnearly approximated to protein--until we arrive at such organisms as the\r\n_Psorospermioe_ and the _Panhistophyton_, which are as much animal as\r\nvegetable in structure, but are animal in their dependence on other\r\norganisms for their food.\r\n\r\nThe singular circumstance observed by Meyer, that the _Torula_ of yeast,\r\nthough an indubitable plant, still flourishes most vigorously when\r\nsupplied with the complex nitrogenous substance, pepsin; the probability\r\nthat the _Peronospora_ is nourished directly by the protoplasm of the\r\npotato-plant; and the wonderful facts which have recently been brought to\r\nlight respecting insectivorous plants, all favour this view; and tend to\r\nthe conclusion that the difference between animal and plant is one of\r\ndegree rather than of kind, and that the problem whether, in a given\r\ncase, an organism is an animal or a plant, may be essentially insoluble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\n\r\nA LOBSTER; OR, THE STUDY OF ZOOLOGY\r\n\r\n[1861]\r\n\r\nNatural history is the name familiarly applied to the study of the\r\nproperties of such natural bodies as minerals, plants, and animals; the\r\nsciences which embody the knowledge man has acquired upon these subjects\r\nare commonly termed Natural Sciences, in contradistinction to other so-\r\ncalled \"physical\" sciences; and those who devote themselves especially to\r\nthe pursuit of such sciences have been and are commonly termed\r\n\"Naturalists.\"\r\n\r\nLinnaeus was a naturalist in this wide sense, and his \"Systema Naturae\" was\r\na work upon natural history, in the broadest acceptation of the term; in\r\nit, that great methodising spirit embodied all that was known in his time\r\nof the distinctive characters of minerals, animals, and plants. But the\r\nenormous stimulus which Linnaeus gave to the investigation of nature soon\r\nrendered it impossible that any one man should write another \"Systema\r\nNaturae,\" and extremely difficult for any one to become even a naturalist\r\nsuch as Linnaeus was.\r\n\r\nGreat as have been the advances made by all the three branches of\r\nscience, of old included under the title of natural history, there can be\r\nno doubt that zoology and botany have grown in an enormously greater\r\nratio than mineralogy; and hence, as I suppose, the name of \"natural\r\nhistory\" has gradually become more and more definitely attached to these\r\nprominent divisions of the subject, and by \"naturalist\" people have meant\r\nmore and more distinctly to imply a student of the structure and function\r\nof living beings.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, it is certain that the advance of knowledge has\r\ngradually widened the distance between mineralogy and its old associates,\r\nwhile it has drawn zoology and botany closer together; so that of late\r\nyears it has been found convenient (and indeed necessary) to associate\r\nthe sciences which deal with vitality and all its phenomena under the\r\ncommon head of \"biology\"; and the biologists have come to repudiate any\r\nblood-relationship with their foster-brothers, the mineralogists.\r\n\r\nCertain broad laws have a general application throughout both the animal\r\nand the vegetable worlds, but the ground common to these kingdoms of\r\nnature is not of very wide extent, and the multiplicity of details is so\r\ngreat, that the student of living beings finds himself obliged to devote\r\nhis attention exclusively either to the one or the other. If he elects to\r\nstudy plants, under any aspect, we know at once what to call him. He is a\r\nbotanist, and his science is botany. But if the investigation of animal\r\nlife be his choice, the name generally applied to him will vary according\r\nto the kind of animals he studies, or the particular phenomena of animal\r\nlife to which he confines his attention. If the study of man is his\r\nobject, he is called an anatomist, or a physiologist, or an ethnologist;\r\nbut if he dissects animals, or examines into the mode in which their\r\nfunctions are performed, he is a comparative anatomist or comparative\r\nphysiologist. If he turns his attention to fossil animals, he is a\r\npalaeontologist. If his mind is more particularly directed to the specific\r\ndescription, discrimination, classification, and distribution of animals,\r\nhe is termed a zoologist.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the present discourse, however, I shall recognise none\r\nof these titles save the last, which I shall employ as the equivalent of\r\nbotanist, and I shall use the term zoology is denoting the whole doctrine\r\nof animal life, in contradistinction to botany, which signifies the whole\r\ndoctrine of vegetable life.\r\n\r\nEmployed in this sense, zoology, like botany, is divisible into three\r\ngreat but subordinate sciences, morphology, physiology, and distribution,\r\neach of which may, to a very great extent, be studied independently of\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nZoological morphology is the doctrine of animal form or structure.\r\nAnatomy is one of its branches; development is another; while\r\nclassification is the expression of the relations which different animals\r\nbear to one another, in respect of their anatomy and their development.\r\n\r\nZoological distribution is the study of animals in relation to the\r\nterrestrial conditions which obtain now, or have obtained at any previous\r\nepoch of the earth's history.\r\n\r\nZoological physiology, lastly, is the doctrine of the functions or\r\nactions of animals. It regards animal bodies as machines impelled by\r\ncertain forces, and performing an amount of work which can be expressed\r\nin terms of the ordinary forces of nature. The final object of physiology\r\nis to deduce the facts of morphology, on the one hand, and those of\r\ndistribution on the other, from the laws of the molecular forces of\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nSuch is the scope of zoology. But if I were to content myself with the\r\nenunciation of these dry definitions, I should ill exemplify that method\r\nof teaching this branch of physical science, which it is my chief\r\nbusiness to-night to recommend. Let us turn away then from abstract\r\ndefinitions. Let us take some concrete living thing, some animal, the\r\ncommoner the better, and let us see how the application of common sense\r\nand common logic to the obvious facts it presents, inevitably leads us\r\ninto all these branches of zoological science.\r\n\r\nI have before me a lobster. When I examine it, what appears to be the\r\nmost striking character it presents? Why, I observe that this part which\r\nwe call the tail of the lobster, is made up of six distinct hard rings\r\nand a seventh terminal piece. If I separate one of the middle rings, say\r\nthe third, I find it carries upon its under surface a pair of limbs or\r\nappendages, each of which consists of a stalk and two terminal pieces. So\r\nthat I can represent a transverse section of the ring and its appendages\r\nupon the diagram board in this way.\r\n\r\nIf I now take the fourth ring, I find it has the same structure, and so\r\nhave the fifth and the second; so that, in each of these divisions of the\r\ntail, I find parts which correspond with one another, a ring and two\r\nappendages; and in each appendage a stalk and two end pieces. These\r\ncorresponding parts are called, in the technical language of anatomy,\r\n\"homologous parts.\" The ring of the third division is the \"homologue\" of\r\nthe ring of the fifth, the appendage of the former is the homologue of\r\nthe appendage of the latter. And, as each division exhibits corresponding\r\nparts in corresponding places, we say that all the divisions are\r\nconstructed upon the same plan. But now let us consider the sixth\r\ndivision. It is similar to, and yet different from, the others. The ring\r\nis essentially the same as in the other divisions; but the appendages\r\nlook at first as if they were very different; and yet when we regard them\r\nclosely, what do we find? A stalk and two terminal divisions, exactly as\r\nin the others, but the stalk is very short and very thick, the terminal\r\ndivisions are very broad and flat, and one of them is divided into two\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nI may say, therefore, that the sixth segment is like the others in plan,\r\nbut that it is modified in its details.\r\n\r\nThe first segment is like the others, so far as its ring is concerned,\r\nand though its appendages differ from any of those yet examined in the\r\nsimplicity of their structure, parts corresponding with the stem and one\r\nof the divisions of the appendages of the other segments can be readily\r\ndiscerned in them.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the lobster's tail is composed of a series of\r\nsegments which are fundamentally similar, though each presents peculiar\r\nmodifications of the plan common to all. But when I turn to the forepart\r\nof the body I see, at first, nothing but a great shield-like shell,\r\ncalled technically the \"carapace,\" ending in front in a sharp spine, on\r\neither side of which are the curious compound eyes, set upon the ends of\r\nstout movable stalks. Behind these, on the under side of the body, are\r\ntwo pairs of long feelers, or antennae, followed by six pairs of jaws\r\nfolded against one another over the mouth, and five pairs of legs, the\r\nforemost of these being the great pinchers, or claws, of the lobster.\r\n\r\nIt looks, at first, a little hopeless to attempt to find in this complex\r\nmass a series of rings, each with its pair of appendages, such as I have\r\nshown you in the abdomen, and yet it is not difficult to demonstrate\r\ntheir existence. Strip off the legs, and you will find that each pair is\r\nattached to a very definite segment of the under wall of the body; but\r\nthese segments, instead of being the lower parts of free rings, as in the\r\ntail, are such parts of rings which are all solidly united and bound\r\ntogether; and the like is true of the jaws, the feelers, and the eye-\r\nstalks, every pair of which is borne upon its own special segment. Thus\r\nthe conclusion is gradually forced upon us, that the body of the lobster\r\nis composed of as many rings as there are pairs of appendages, namely,\r\ntwenty in all, but that the six hindmost rings remain free and movable,\r\nwhile the fourteen front rings become firmly soldered together, their\r\nbacks forming one continuous shield--the carapace.\r\n\r\nUnity of plan, diversity in execution, is the lesson taught by the study\r\nof the rings of the body, and the same instruction is given still more\r\nemphatically by the appendages. If I examine the outermost jaw I find it\r\nconsists of three distinct portions, an inner, a middle, and an outer,\r\nmounted upon a common stem; and if I compare this jaw with the legs\r\nbehind it, or the jaws in front of it, I find it quite easy to see, that,\r\nin the legs, it is the part of the appendage which corresponds with the\r\ninner division, which becomes modified into what we know familiarly as\r\nthe \"leg,\" while the middle division disappears, and the outer division\r\nis hidden under the carapace. Nor is it more difficult to discern that,\r\nin the appendages of the tail, the middle division appears again and the\r\nouter vanishes; while, on the other hand, in the foremost jaw, the so-\r\ncalled mandible, the inner division only is left; and, in the same way,\r\nthe parts of the feelers and of the eye-stalks can be identified with\r\nthose of the legs and jaws.\r\n\r\nBut whither does all this tend? To the very remarkable conclusion that a\r\nunity of plan, of the same kind as that discoverable in the tail or\r\nabdomen of the lobster, pervades the whole organisation of its skeleton,\r\nso that I can return to the diagram representing any one of the rings of\r\nthe tail, which I drew upon the board, and by adding a third division to\r\neach appendage, I can use it as a sort of scheme or plan of any ring of\r\nthe body. I can give names to all the parts of that figure, and then if I\r\ntake any segment of the body of the lobster, I can point out to you\r\nexactly, what modification the general plan has undergone in that\r\nparticular segment; what part has remained movable, and what has become\r\nfixed to another; what has been excessively developed and metamorphosed\r\nand what has been suppressed.\r\n\r\nBut I imagine I hear the question, How is all this to be tested? No doubt\r\nit is a pretty and ingenious way of looking at the structure of any\r\nanimal; but is it anything more? Does Nature acknowledge, in any deeper\r\nway, this unity of plan we seem to trace?\r\n\r\nThe objection suggested by these questions is a very valid and important\r\none, and morphology was in an unsound state so long as it rested upon the\r\nmere perception of the analogies which obtain between fully formed parts.\r\nThe unchecked ingenuity of speculative anatomists proved itself fully\r\ncompetent to spin any number of contradictory hypotheses out of the same\r\nfacts, and endless morphological dreams threatened to supplant scientific\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, there is a criterion of morphological truth, and a sure\r\ntest of all homologies. Our lobster has not always been what we see it;\r\nit was once an egg, a semifluid mass of yolk, not so big as a pin's head,\r\ncontained in a transparent membrane, and exhibiting not the least trace\r\nof any one of those organs, the multiplicity and complexity of which, in\r\nthe adult, are so surprising. After a time, a delicate patch of cellular\r\nmembrane appeared upon one face of this yolk, and that patch was the\r\nfoundation of the whole creature, the clay out of which it would be\r\nmoulded. Gradually investing the yolk, it became subdivided by transverse\r\nconstrictions into segments, the forerunners of the rings of the body.\r\nUpon the ventral surface of each of the rings thus sketched out, a pair\r\nof bud-like prominences made their appearance--the rudiments of the\r\nappendages of the ring. At first, all the appendages were alike, but, as\r\nthey grew, most of them became distinguished into a stem and two terminal\r\ndivisions, to which, in the middle part of the body, was added a third\r\nouter division; and it was only at a later period, that by the\r\nmodification, or absorption, of certain of these primitive constituents,\r\nthe limbs acquired their perfect form.\r\n\r\nThus the study of development proves that the doctrine of unity of plan\r\nis not merely a fancy, that it is not merely one way of looking at the\r\nmatter, but that it is the expression of deep-seated natural facts. The\r\nlegs and jaws of the lobster may not merely be regarded as modifications\r\nof a common type,--in fact and in nature they are so,--the leg and the\r\njaw of the young animal being, at first, indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nThese are wonderful truths, the more so because the zoologist finds them\r\nto be of universal application. The investigation of a polype, of a\r\nsnail, of a fish, of a horse, or of a man, would have led us, though by a\r\nless easy path, perhaps, to exactly the same point. Unity of plan\r\neverywhere lies hidden under the mask of diversity of structure--the\r\ncomplex is everywhere evolved out of the simple. Every animal has at\r\nfirst the form of an egg, and every animal and every organic part, in\r\nreaching its adult state, passes through conditions common to other\r\nanimals and other adult parts; and this leads me to another point. I have\r\nhitherto spoken as if the lobster were alone in the world, but, as I need\r\nhardly remind you, there are myriads of other animal organisms. Of these,\r\nsome, such as men, horses, birds, fishes, snails, slugs, oysters, corals,\r\nand sponges, are not in the least like the lobster. But other animals,\r\nthough they may differ a good deal from the lobster, are yet either very\r\nlike it, or are like something that is like it. The cray fish, the rock\r\nlobster, and the prawn, and the shrimp, for example, however different,\r\nare yet so like lobsters, that a child would group them as of the lobster\r\nkind, in contradistinction to snails and slugs; and these last again\r\nwould form a kind by themselves, in contradistinction to cows, horses,\r\nand sheep, the cattle kind.\r\n\r\nBut this spontaneous grouping into \"kinds\" is the first essay of the\r\nhuman mind at classification, or the calling by a common name of those\r\nthings that are alike, and the arranging them in such a manner as best to\r\nsuggest the sum of their likenesses and unlikenesses to other things.\r\n\r\nThose kinds which include no other subdivisions than the sexes, or\r\nvarious breeds, are called, in technical language, species. The English\r\nlobster is a species, our cray fish is another, our prawn is another. In\r\nother countries, however, there are lobsters, cray fish, and prawns, very\r\nlike ours, and yet presenting sufficient differences to deserve\r\ndistinction. Naturalists, therefore, express this resemblance and this\r\ndiversity by grouping them as distinct species of the same \"genus.\" But\r\nthe lobster and the cray fish, though belonging to distinct genera, have\r\nmany features in common, and hence are grouped together in an assemblage\r\nwhich is called a family. More distant resemblances connect the lobster\r\nwith the prawn and the crab, which are expressed by putting all these\r\ninto the same order. Again, more remote, but still very definite,\r\nresemblances unite the lobster with the woodlouse, the king crab, the\r\nwater flea, and the barnacle, and separate them from all other animals;\r\nwhence they collectively constitute the larger group, or class,\r\n_Crustacea_. But the _Crustacea_ exhibit many peculiar features in common\r\nwith insects, spiders, and centipedes, so that these are grouped into the\r\nstill larger assemblage or \"province\" _Articulata_; and, finally, the\r\nrelations which these have to worms and other lower animals, are\r\nexpressed by combining the whole vast aggregate into the sub-kingdom of\r\n_Annulosa_.\r\n\r\nIf I had worked my way from a sponge instead of a lobster, I should have\r\nfound it associated, by like ties, with a great number of other animals\r\ninto the sub-kingdom _Protozoa_; if I had selected a fresh-water polype\r\nor a coral, the members of what naturalists term the sub-kingdom\r\n_Coelenterata_, would have grouped themselves around my type; had a snail\r\nbeen chosen, the inhabitants of all univalve and bivalve, land and water,\r\nshells, the lamp shells, the squids, and the sea-mat would have gradually\r\nlinked themselves on to it as members of the same sub-kingdom of\r\n_Mollusca_; and finally, starting from man, I should have been compelled\r\nto admit first, the ape, the rat, the horse, the dog, into the same\r\nclass; and then the bird, the crocodile, the turtle, the frog, and the\r\nfish, into the same sub-kingdom of _Vertebrata_.\r\n\r\nAnd if I had followed out all these various lines of classification\r\nfully, I should discover in the end that there was no animal, either\r\nrecent or fossil, which did not at once fall into one or other of these\r\nsub-kingdoms. In other words, every animal is organised upon one or other\r\nof the five, or more, plans, the existence of which renders our\r\nclassification possible. And so definitely and precisely marked is the\r\nstructure of each animal, that, in the present state of our knowledge,\r\nthere is not the least evidence to prove that a form, in the slightest\r\ndegree transitional between any of the two groups _Vertebrata, Annulosa,\r\nMollusca_, and _Coelenterata_, either exists, or has existed, during that\r\nperiod of the earth's history which is recorded by the geologist.[1]\r\nNevertheless, you must not for a moment suppose, because no such\r\ntransitional forms are known, that the members of the sub-kingdoms are\r\ndisconnected from, or independent of, one another. On the contrary, in\r\ntheir earliest condition they are all similar, and the primordial germs\r\nof a man, a dog, a bird, a fish, a beetle, a snail, and a polype are, in\r\nno essential structural respects, distinguishable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The different grouping necessitated by later knowledge does\r\nnot affect the principle of the argument.--1894.]\r\n\r\nIn this broad sense, it may with truth be said, that all living animals,\r\nand all those dead faunae which geology reveals, are bound together by an\r\nall-pervading unity of organisation, of the same character, though not\r\nequal in degree, to that which enables us to discern one and the same\r\nplan amidst the twenty different segments of a lobster's body. Truly it\r\nhas been said, that to a clear eye the smallest fact is a window through\r\nwhich the Infinite may be seen.\r\n\r\nTurning from these purely morphological considerations, let us now\r\nexamine into the manner in which the attentive study of the lobster\r\nimpels us into other lines of research.\r\n\r\nLobsters are found in all the European seas; but on the opposite shores\r\nof the Atlantic and in the seas of the southern hemisphere they do not\r\nexist. They are, however, represented in these regions by very closely\r\nallied, but distinct forms--the _Homarus Americanus_ and the _Homarus\r\nCapensis:_ so that we may say that the European has one species of\r\n_Homuarus_; the American, another; the African, another; and thus the\r\nremarkable facts of geographical distribution begin to dawn upon us.\r\n\r\nAgain, if we examine the contents of the earth's crust, we shall find in\r\nthe latter of those deposits, which have served as the great burying\r\ngrounds of past ages, numberless lobster-like animals, but none so\r\nsimilar to our living lobster as to make zoologists sure that they\r\nbelonged even to the same genus. If we go still further back in time, we\r\ndiscover, in the oldest rocks of all, the remains of animals, constructed\r\non the same general plan as the lobster, and belonging to the same great\r\ngroup of _Crustacea_; but for the most part totally different from the\r\nlobster, and indeed from any other living form of crustacean; and thus we\r\ngain a notion of that successive change of the animal population of the\r\nglobe, in past ages, which is the most striking fact revealed by geology.\r\n\r\nConsider, now, where our inquiries have led us. We studied our type\r\nmorphologically, when we determined its anatomy and its development, and\r\nwhen comparing it, in these respects, with other animals, we made out its\r\nplace in a system of classification. If we were to examine every animal\r\nin a similar manner, we should establish a complete body of zoological\r\nmorphology.\r\n\r\nAgain, we investigated the distribution of our type in space and in time,\r\nand, if the like had been done with every animal, the sciences of\r\ngeographical and geological distribution would have attained their limit.\r\n\r\nBut you will observe one remarkable circumstance, that, up to this point,\r\nthe question of the life of these organisms has not come under\r\nconsideration. Morphology and distribution might be studied almost as\r\nwell, if animals and plants were a peculiar kind of crystals, and\r\npossessed none of those functions which distinguish living beings so\r\nremarkably. But the facts of morphology and distribution have to be\r\naccounted for, and the science, the aim of which it is to account for\r\nthem, is Physiology.\r\n\r\nLet us return to our lobster once more. If we watched the creature in its\r\nnative element, we should see it climbing actively the submerged rocks,\r\namong which it delights to live, by means of its strong legs; or swimming\r\nby powerful strokes of its great tail, the appendages of the sixth joint\r\nof which are spread out into a broad fan-like Propeller: seize it, and it\r\nwill show you that its great claws are no mean weapons of offence;\r\nsuspend a piece of carrion among its haunts, and it will greedily devour\r\nit, tearing and crushing the flesh by means of its multitudinous jaws.\r\n\r\nSuppose that we had known nothing of the lobster but as an inert mass, an\r\norganic crystal, if I may use the phrase, and that we could suddenly see\r\nit exerting all these powers, what wonderful new ideas and new questions\r\nwould arise in our minds! The great new question would be, \"How does all\r\nthis take place?\" the chief new idea would be, the idea of adaptation to\r\npurpose,--the notion, that the constituents of animal bodies are not mere\r\nunconnected parts, but organs working together to an end. Let us consider\r\nthe tail of the lobster again from this point of view. Morphology has\r\ntaught us that it is a series of segments composed of homologous parts,\r\nwhich undergo various modifications--beneath and through which a common\r\nplan of formation is discernible. But if I look at the same part\r\nphysiologically, I see that it is a most beautifully constructed organ of\r\nlocomotion, by means of which the animal can swiftly propel itself either\r\nbackwards or forwards.\r\n\r\nBut how is this remarkable propulsive machine made to perform its\r\nfunctions? If I were suddenly to kill one of these animals and to take\r\nout all the soft parts, I should find the shell to be perfectly inert, to\r\nhave no more power of moving itself than is possessed by the machinery of\r\na mill when disconnected from its steam-engine or water-wheel. But if I\r\nwere to open it, and take out the viscera only, leaving the white flesh,\r\nI should perceive that the lobster could bend and extend its tail as well\r\nas before. If I were to cut off the tail, I should cease to find any\r\nspontaneous motion in it; but on pinching any portion of the flesh, I\r\nshould observe that it underwent a very curious change--each fibre\r\nbecoming shorter and thicker. By this act of contraction, as it is\r\ntermed, the parts to which the ends of the fibre are attached are, of\r\ncourse, approximated; and according to the relations of their points of\r\nattachment to the centres of motions of the different rings, the bending\r\nor the extension of the tail results. Close observation of the newly-\r\nopened lobster would soon show that all its movements are due to the same\r\ncause--the shortening and thickening of these fleshy fibres, which are\r\ntechnically called muscles.\r\n\r\nHere, then, is a capital fact. The movements of the lobster are due to\r\nmuscular contractility. But why does a muscle contract at one time and\r\nnot at another? Why does one whole group of muscles contract when the\r\nlobster wishes to extend his tail, and another group when he desires to\r\nbend it? What is it originates, directs, and controls the motive power?\r\n\r\nExperiment, the great instrument for the ascertainment of truth in\r\nphysical science, answers this question for us. In the head of the\r\nlobster there lies a small mass of that peculiar tissue which is known as\r\nnervous substance. Cords of similar matter connect his brain of the\r\nlobster, directly or indirectly, with the muscles. Now, if these\r\ncommunicating cords are cut, the brain remaining entire, the power of\r\nexerting what we call voluntary motion in the parts below the section is\r\ndestroyed; and, on the other hand, if, the cords remaining entire, the\r\nbrain mass be destroyed, the same voluntary mobility is equally lost.\r\nWhence the inevitable conclusion is, that the power of originating these\r\nmotions resides in the brain and is propagated along the nervous cords.\r\n\r\nIn the higher animals the phenomena which attend this transmission have\r\nbeen investigated, and the exertion of the peculiar energy which resides\r\nin the nerves has been found to be accompanied by a disturbance of the\r\nelectrical state of their molecules.\r\n\r\nIf we could exactly estimate the signification of this disturbance; if we\r\ncould obtain the value of a given exertion of nerve force by determining\r\nthe quantity of electricity, or of heat, of which it is the equivalent;\r\nif we could ascertain upon what arrangement, or other condition of the\r\nmolecules of matter, the manifestation of the nervous and muscular\r\nenergies depends (and doubtless science will some day or other ascertain\r\nthese points), physiologists would have attained their ultimate goal in\r\nthis direction; they would have determined the relation of the motive\r\nforce of animals to the other forms of force found in nature; and if the\r\nsame process had been successfully performed for all the operations which\r\nare carried on in, and by, the animal frame, physiology would be perfect,\r\nand the facts of morphology and distribution would be deducible from the\r\nlaws which physiologists had established, combined with those determining\r\nthe condition of the surrounding universe.\r\n\r\nThere is not a fragment of the organism of this humble animal whose study\r\nwould not lead us into regions of thought as large as those which I have\r\nbriefly opened up to you; but what I have been saying, I trust, has not\r\nonly enabled you to form a conception of the scope and purport of\r\nzoology, but has given you an imperfect example of the manner in which,\r\nin my opinion, that science, or indeed any physical science, may be best\r\ntaught. The great matter is, to make teaching real and practical, by\r\nfixing the attention of the student on particular facts; but at the same\r\ntime it should be rendered broad and comprehensive, by constant reference\r\nto the generalisations of which all particular facts are illustrations.\r\nThe lobster has served as a type of the whole animal kingdom, and its\r\nanatomy and physiology have illustrated for us some of the greatest\r\ntruths of biology. The student who has once seen for himself the facts\r\nwhich I have described, has had their relations explained to him, and has\r\nclearly comprehended them, has, so far, a knowledge of zoology, which is\r\nreal and genuine, however limited it may be, and which is worth more than\r\nall the mere reading knowledge of the science he could ever acquire. His\r\nzoological information is, so far, knowledge and not mere hearsay.\r\n\r\nAnd if it were nay business to fit you for the certificate in zoological\r\nscience granted by this department, I should pursue a course precisely\r\nsimilar in principle to that which I have taken to-night. I should select\r\na fresh-water sponge, a fresh-water polype or a _Cyanoea_, a fresh-water\r\nmussel, a lobster, a fowl, as types of the five primary divisions of the\r\nanimal kingdom. I should explain their structure very fully, and show how\r\neach illustrated the great principles of zoology. Having gone very\r\ncarefully and fully over this ground, I should feel that you had a safe\r\nfoundation, and I should then take you in the same way, but less\r\nminutely, over similarly selected illustrative types of the classes; and\r\nthen I should direct your attention to the special forms enumerated under\r\nthe head of types, in this syllabus, and to the other facts there\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThat would, speaking generally, be my plan. But I have undertaken to\r\nexplain to you the best mode of acquiring and communicating a knowledge\r\nof zoology, and you may therefore fairly ask me for a more detailed and\r\nprecise account of the manner in which I should propose to furnish you\r\nwith the information I refer to.\r\n\r\nMy own impression is, that the best model for all kinds of training in\r\nphysical science is that afforded by the method of teaching anatomy, in\r\nuse in the medical schools. This method consists of three elements--\r\nlectures, demonstrations, and examinations.\r\n\r\nThe object of lectures is, in the first place, to awaken the attention\r\nand excite the enthusiasm of the student; and this, I am sure, may be\r\neffected to a far greater extent by the oral discourse and by the\r\npersonal influence of a respected teacher than in any other way.\r\nSecondly, lectures have the double use of guiding the student to the\r\nsalient points of a subject, and at the same time forcing him to attend\r\nto the whole of it, and not merely to that part which takes his fancy.\r\nAnd lastly, lectures afford the student the opportunity of seeking\r\nexplanations of those difficulties which will, and indeed ought to, arise\r\nin the course of his studies.\r\n\r\nWhat books shall I read? is a question constantly put by the student to\r\nthe teacher. My reply usually is, \"None: write your notes out carefully\r\nand fully; strive to understand them thoroughly; come to me for the\r\nexplanation of anything you cannot understand; and I would rather you did\r\nnot distract your mind by reading.\" A properly composed course of\r\nlectures ought to contain fully as much matter as a student can\r\nassimilate in the time occupied by its delivery; and the teacher should\r\nalways recollect that his business is to feed, and not to cram the\r\nintellect. Indeed, I believe that a student who gains from a course of\r\nlectures the simple habit of concentrating his attention upon a\r\ndefinitely limited series of facts, until they are thoroughly mastered,\r\nhas made a step of immeasurable importance.\r\n\r\nBut, however good lectures may be, and however extensive the course of\r\nreading by which they are followed up, they are but accessories to the\r\ngreat instrument of scientific teaching--demonstration. If I insist\r\nunweariedly, nay fanatically, upon the importance of physical science as\r\nan educational agent, it is because the study of any branch of science,\r\nif properly conducted, appears to me to fill up a void left by all other\r\nmeans of education. I have the greatest respect and love for literature;\r\nnothing would grieve me more than to see literary training other than a\r\nvery prominent branch of education: indeed, I wish that real literary\r\ndiscipline were far more attended to than it is; but I cannot shut my\r\neyes to the fact, that there is a vast difference between men who have\r\nhad a purely literary, and those who have had a sound scientific,\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nSeeking for the cause of this difference, I imagine I can find it in the\r\nfact that, in the world of letters, learning and knowledge are one, and\r\nbooks are the source of both; whereas in science, as in life, learning\r\nand knowledge are distinct, and the study of things, and not of books, is\r\nthe source of the latter.\r\n\r\nAll that literature has to bestow may be obtained by reading and by\r\npractical exercise in writing and in speaking; but I do not exaggerate\r\nwhen I say, that none of the best gifts of science are to be won by these\r\nmeans. On the contrary, the great benefit which a scientific education\r\nbestows, whether is training or as knowledge, is dependent upon the\r\nextent to which the mind of the student is brought into immediate contact\r\nwith facts--upon the degree to which he learns the habit of appealing\r\ndirectly to Nature, and of acquiring through his senses concrete images\r\nof those properties of things, which are, and always will be, but\r\napproximatively expressed in human language. Our way of looking at\r\nNature, and of speaking about her, varies from year to year; but a fact\r\nonce seen, a relation of cause and effect, once demonstratively\r\napprehended, are possessions which neither change nor pass away, but, on\r\nthe contrary, form fixed centres, about which other truths aggregate by\r\nnatural affinity.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the great business of the scientific teacher is, to imprint\r\nthe fundamental, irrefragable facts of his science, not only by words\r\nupon the mind, but by sensible impressions upon the eye, and ear, and\r\ntouch of the student, in so complete a manner, that every term used, or\r\nlaw enunciated, should afterwards call up vivid images of the particular\r\nstructural, or other, facts which furnished the demonstration of the law,\r\nor the illustration of the term.\r\n\r\nNow this important operation can only be achieved by constant\r\ndemonstration, which may take place to a certain imperfect extent during\r\na lecture, but which ought also to be carried on independently, and which\r\nshould be addressed to each individual student, the teacher endeavouring,\r\nnot so much to show a thing to the learner, as to make him see it for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that there are great practical difficulties in the way of\r\neffectual zoological demonstrations. The dissection of animals is not\r\naltogether pleasant, and requires much time; nor is it easy to secure an\r\nadequate supply of the needful specimens. The botanist has here a great\r\nadvantage; his specimens are easily obtained, are clean and wholesome,\r\nand can be dissected in a private house as well as anywhere else; and\r\nhence, I believe, the fact, that botany is so much more readily and\r\nbetter taught than its sister science. But, be it difficult or be it\r\neasy, if zoological science is to be properly studied, demonstration,\r\nand, consequently, dissection, must be had. Without it, no man can have a\r\nreally sound knowledge of animal organisation.\r\n\r\nA good deal may be done, however, without actual dissection on the\r\nstudent's part, by demonstration upon specimens and preparations; and in\r\nall probability it would not be very difficult, were the demand\r\nsufficient, to organise collections of such objects, sufficient for all\r\nthe purposes of elementary teaching, at a comparatively cheap rate. Even\r\nwithout these, much might be effected, if the zoological collections,\r\nwhich are open to the public, were arranged according to what has been\r\ntermed the \"typical principle\"; that is to say, if the specimens exposed\r\nto public view were so selected that the public could learn something\r\nfrom them, instead of being, as at present, merely confused by their\r\nmultiplicity. For example, the grand ornithological gallery at the\r\nBritish Museum contains between two and three thousand species of birds,\r\nand sometimes five or six specimens of a species. They are very pretty to\r\nlook at, and some of the cases are, indeed, splendid; but I will\r\nundertake to say, that no man but a professed ornithologist has ever\r\ngathered much information from the collection. Certainly, no one of the\r\ntens of thousands of the general public who have walked through that\r\ngallery ever knew more about the essential peculiarities of birds when he\r\nleft the gallery than when he entered it. But if, somewhere in that vast\r\nhall, there were a few preparations, exemplifying the leading structural\r\npeculiarities and the mode of development of a common fowl; if the types\r\nof the genera, the leading modifications in the skeleton, in the plumage\r\nat various ages, in the mode of nidification, and the like, among birds,\r\nwere displayed; and if the other specimens were put away in a place where\r\nthe men of science, to whom they are alone useful, could have free access\r\nto them, I can conceive that this collection might become a great\r\ninstrument of scientific education.\r\n\r\nThe last implement of the teacher to which I have adverted is\r\nexamination--a means of education now so thoroughly understood that I\r\nneed hardly enlarge upon it. I hold that both written and oral\r\nexaminations are indispensable, and, by requiring the description of\r\nspecimens, they may be made to supplement demonstration.\r\n\r\nSuch is the fullest reply the time at my disposal will allow me to give\r\nto the question--how may a knowledge of zoology be best acquired and\r\ncommunicated?\r\n\r\nBut there is a previous question which may be moved, and which, in fact,\r\nI know many are inclined to move. It is the question, why should teachers\r\nbe encouraged to acquire a knowledge of this, or any other branch of\r\nphysical science? What is the use, it is said, of attempting to make\r\nphysical science a branch of primary education? Is it not probable that\r\nteachers, in pursuing such studies, will be led astray from the\r\nacquirement of more important but less attractive knowledge? And, even if\r\nthey can learn something of science without prejudice to their\r\nusefulness, what is the good of their attempting to instil that knowledge\r\ninto boys whose real business is the acquisition of reading, writing, and\r\narithmetic?\r\n\r\nThese questions are, and will be, very commonly asked, for they arise\r\nfrom that profound ignorance of the value and true position of physical\r\nscience, which infests the minds of the most highly educated and\r\nintelligent classes of the community. But if I did not feel well assured\r\nthat they are capable of being easily and satisfactorily answered; that\r\nthey have been answered over and over again; and that the time will come\r\nwhen men of liberal education will blush to raise such questions--I\r\nshould be ashamed of my position here to-night. Without doubt, it is your\r\ngreat and very important function to carry out elementary education;\r\nwithout question, anything that should interfere with the faithful\r\nfulfilment of that duty on your part would be a great evil; and if I\r\nthought that your acquirement of the elements of physical science, and\r\nyour communication of those elements to your pupils, involved any sort of\r\ninterference with your proper duties, I should be the first person to\r\nprotest against your being encouraged to do anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nBut is it true that the acquisition of such a knowledge of science as is\r\nproposed, and the communication of that knowledge, are calculated to\r\nweaken your usefulness? Or may I not rather ask, is it possible for you\r\nto discharge your functions properly without these aids?\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of primary intellectual education? I apprehend that\r\nits first object is to train the young in the use of those tools\r\nwherewith men extract knowledge from the ever-shifting succession of\r\nphenomena which pass before their eyes; and that its second object is to\r\ninform them of the fundamental laws which have been found by experience\r\nto govern the course of things, so that they may not be turned out into\r\nthe world naked, defenceless, and a prey to the events they might\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nA boy is taught to read his own and other languages, in order that he may\r\nhave access to infinitely wider stores of knowledge than could ever be\r\nopened to him by oral intercourse with his fellow men; he learns to\r\nwrite, that his means of communication with the rest of mankind may be\r\nindefinitely enlarged, and that he may record and store up the knowledge\r\nhe acquires. He is taught elementary mathematics, that he may understand\r\nall those relations of number and form, upon which the transactions of\r\nmen, associated in complicated societies, are built, and that he may have\r\nsome practice in deductive reasoning.\r\n\r\nAll these operations of reading, writing, and ciphering, are intellectual\r\ntools, whose use should, before all things, be learned, and learned\r\nthoroughly; so that the youth may be enabled to make his life that which\r\nit ought to be, a continual progress in learning and in wisdom.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition, primary education endeavours to fit a boy out with a\r\ncertain equipment of positive knowledge. He is taught the great laws of\r\nmorality; the religion of his sect; so much history and geography as will\r\ntell him where the great countries of the world are, what they are, and\r\nhow they have become what they are.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt all these are most fitting and excellent things to teach a\r\nboy; I should be very sorry to omit any of them from any scheme of\r\nprimary intellectual education. The system is excellent, so far as it\r\ngoes.\r\n\r\nBut if I regard it closely, a curious reflection arises. I suppose that,\r\nfifteen hundred years ago, the child of any well-to-do Roman citizen was\r\ntaught just these same things; reading and writing in his own, and,\r\nperhaps, the Greek tongue; the elements of mathematics; and the religion,\r\nmorality, history, and geography current in his time. Furthermore, I do\r\nnot think I err in affirming, that, if such a Christian Roman boy, who\r\nhad finished his education, could be transplanted into one of our public\r\nschools, and pass through its course of instruction, he would not meet\r\nwith a single unfamiliar line of thought; amidst all the new facts he\r\nwould have to learn, not one would suggest a different mode of regarding\r\nthe universe from that current in his own time.\r\n\r\nAnd yet surely there is some great difference between the civilisation of\r\nthe fourth century and that of the nineteenth, and still more between the\r\nintellectual habits and tone of thought of that day and this?\r\n\r\nAnd what has made this difference? I answer fearlessly--The prodigious\r\ndevelopment of physical science within the last two centuries.\r\n\r\nModern civilisation rests upon physical science; take away her gifts to\r\nour own country, and our position among the leading nations of the world\r\nis gone to-morrow; for it is physical science only that makes\r\nintelligence and moral energy stronger than brute force.\r\n\r\nThe whole of modern thought is steeped in science; it has made its way\r\ninto the works of our best poets, and even the mere man of letters, who\r\naffects to ignore and despise science, is unconsciously impregnated with\r\nher spirit, and indebted for his best products to her methods. I believe\r\nthat the greatest intellectual revolution mankind has yet seen is now\r\nslowly taking place by her agency. She is teaching the world that the\r\nultimate court of appeal is observation and experiment, and not\r\nauthority; she is teaching it to estimate the value of evidence; she is\r\ncreating a firm and living faith in the existence of immutable moral and\r\nphysical laws, perfect obedience to which is the highest possible aim of\r\nan intelligent being.\r\n\r\nBut of all this your old stereotyped system of education takes no note.\r\nPhysical science, its methods, its problems, and its difficulties, will\r\nmeet the poorest boy at every turn, and yet we educate him in such a\r\nmanner that he shall enter the world as ignorant of the existence of the\r\nmethods and facts of science as the day he was born. The modern world is\r\nfull of artillery; and we turn out our children to do battle in it,\r\nequipped with the shield and sword of an ancient gladiator.\r\n\r\nPosterity will cry shame on us if we do not remedy this deplorable state\r\nof things. Nay, if we live twenty years longer, our own consciences will\r\ncry shame on us.\r\n\r\nIt is my firm conviction that the only way to remedy it is to make the\r\nelements of physical science an integral part of primary education. I\r\nhave endeavoured to show you how that may be done for that branch of\r\nscience which it is my business to pursue; and I can but add, that I\r\nshould look upon the day when every schoolmaster throughout this land was\r\na centre of genuine, however rudimentary, scientific knowledge, as an\r\nepoch in the history of the country.\r\n\r\nBut let me entreat you to remember my last words. Addressing myself to\r\nyou, as teachers, I would say, mere book learning in physical science is\r\na sham and a delusion--what you teach, unless you wish to be impostors,\r\nthat you must first know; and real knowledge in science means personal\r\nacquaintance with the facts, be they few or many.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It has been suggested to me that these words may be taken to\r\nimply a discouragement on my part of any sort of scientific instruction\r\nwhich does not give an acquaintance with the facts at first hand. But\r\nthis is not my meaning. The ideal of scientific teaching is, no doubt, a\r\nsystem by which the scholar sees every fact for himself, and the teacher\r\nsupplies only the explanations. Circumstances, however, do not often\r\nallow of the attainment of that ideal, and we must put up with the next\r\nbest system--one in which the scholar takes a good deal on trust from a\r\nteacher, who, knowing the facts by his own knowledge, can describe them\r\nwith so much vividness as to enable his audience to form competent ideas\r\nconcerning them. The system which I repudiate is that which allows\r\nteachers who have not come into direct contact with the leading facts of\r\na science to pass their second-hand information on. The scientific virus,\r\nlike vaccine lymph, if passed through too long a succession of organisms,\r\nwill lose all its effect in protecting the young against the intellectual\r\nepidemics to which they are exposed.\r\n\r\n[The remarks on p. 222 applied to the Natural History Collection of the\r\nBritish Museum in 1861.

I shall not\r\npresume to attempt a panoramic survey of the world of science, nor even\r\nto give a sketch of what is doing in the one great province of biology,\r\nwith some portions of which my ordinary occupations render me familiar.\r\nBut I shall endeavour to put before you the history of the rise and\r\nprogress of a single biological doctrine; and I shall try to give some\r\nnotion of the fruits, both intellectual and practical, which we owe,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, to the working out, by seven generations of\r\npatient and laborious investigators, of the thought which arose, more\r\nthan two centuries ago, in the mind of a sagacious and observant Italian\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of everyday experience that it is difficult to prevent\r\nmany articles of food from becoming covered with mould; that fruit, sound\r\nenough to all appearance, often contains grubs at the core; that meat,\r\nleft to itself in the air, is apt to putrefy and swarm with maggots. Even\r\nordinary water, if allowed to stand in an open vessel, sooner or later\r\nbecomes turbid and full of living matter.\r\n\r\nThe philosophers of antiquity, interrogated as to the cause of these\r\nphenomena, were provided with a ready and a plausible answer. It did not\r\nenter their minds even to doubt that these low forms of life were\r\ngenerated in the matters in which they made their appearance. Lucretius,\r\nwho had drunk deeper of the scientific spirit than any poet of ancient or\r\nmodern times except Goethe, intends to speak as a philosopher, rather\r\nthan as a poet, when he writes that \"with good reason the earth has\r\ngotten the name of mother, since all things are produced out of the\r\nearth. And many living creatures, even now, spring out of the earth,\r\ntaking form by the rains and the heat of the sun.\"[1] The axiom of\r\nancient science, \"that the corruption of one thing is the birth of\r\nanother,\" had its popular embodiment in the notion that a seed dies\r\nbefore the young plant springs from it; a belief so widespread and so\r\nfixed, that Saint Paul appeals to it in one of the most splendid\r\noutbursts of his fervid eloquence:--\r\n\r\n\"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is thus that Mr. Munro renders\r\n\r\n\"Linquitur, ut merito maternum nomen adepta\r\nTerra sit, e terra quoniam sunt cuncta creata.\r\nMultaque nunc etiam exsistant animalia terris\r\nImbribus et calido solis concreta vapore.\"\r\n\r\n_De Rerum Natura_, lib. v. 793-796.\r\n\r\nBut would not the meaning of the last line be better rendered \"Developed\r\nin rain-water and in the warm vapours raised by the sun\"?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: 1 Corinthians xv. 36.]\r\n\r\nThe proposition that life may, and does, proceed from that which has no\r\nlife, then, was held alike by the philosophers, the poets, and the\r\npeople, of the most enlightened nations, eighteen hundred years ago; and\r\nit remained the accepted doctrine of learned and unlearned Europe,\r\nthrough the Middle Ages, down even to the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly counted among the many merits of our great countryman,\r\nHarvey, that he was the first to declare the opposition of fact to\r\nvenerable authority in this, as in other matters; but I can discover no\r\njustification for this widespread notion. After careful search through\r\nthe \"Exercitationes de Generatione,\" the most that appears clear to me\r\nis, that Harvey believed all animals and plants to spring from what he\r\nterms a \"_primordium vegetale_,\" a phrase which may nowadays be rendered\r\n\"a vegetative germ\"; and this, he says, is _\"oviforme_,\" or \"egg-like\";\r\nnot, he is careful to add, that it necessarily has the shape of an egg,\r\nbut because it has the constitution and nature of one. That this\r\n\"_primordium oviforme_\" must needs, in all cases, proceed from a living\r\nparent is nowhere expressly maintained by Harvey, though such an opinion\r\nmay be thought to be implied in one or two passages; while, on the other\r\nhand, he does, more than once, use language which is consistent only with\r\na full belief in spontaneous or equivocal generation.[3] In fact, the\r\nmain concern of Harvey's wonderful little treatise is not with\r\ngeneration, in the physiological sense, at all, but with development; and\r\nhis great object is the establishment of the doctrine of epigenesis.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See the following passage in Exercitatio I.:--\"Item _sponte\r\nnascentia_ dicuntur; non quod ex _putredine_ oriunda sint, sed quod casu,\r\nnaturae sponte, et aequivocâ (ut aiunt) generatione, a parentibus sui\r\ndissimilibus proveniant.\" Again, in _De Uteri Membranis:_--\"In cunctorum\r\nviventium generatione (sicut diximus) hoc solenne est, ut ortum ducunt a\r\n_primordio_ aliquo, quod tum materiam tum elficiendi potestatem in se\r\nhabet: sitque, adeo id, ex quo et a quo quicquid nascitur, ortum suum\r\nducat. Tale primordium in animalibus (_sive ab aliis generantibus\r\nproveniant, sive sponte, aut ex putredine nascentur_) est humor in\r\ntunicâ, aliquâaut putami ne conclusus.\" Compare also what Redi has to say\r\nrespecting Harvey's opinions, _Esperienze_, p. 11.]\r\n\r\nThe first distinct enunciation of the hypothesis that all living matter\r\nhas sprung from pre-existing living matter, came from a contemporary,\r\nthough a junior, of Harvey, a native of that country, fertile in men\r\ngreat in all departments of human activity, which was to intellectual\r\nEurope, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, what Germany is in\r\nthe nineteenth. It was in Italy, and from Italian teachers, that Harvey\r\nreceived the most important part of his scientific education. And it was\r\na student trained in the same schools, Francesco Redi--a man of the\r\nwidest knowledge and most versatile abilities, distinguished alike as\r\nscholar, poet, physician, and naturalist--who, just two hundred and two\r\nyears ago, published his \"Esperienze intorno alla Generazione degl'\r\nInsetti,\" and gave to the world the idea, the growth of which it is my\r\npurpose to trace. Redi's book went through five editions in twenty years;\r\nand the extreme simplicity of his experiments, and the clearness of his\r\narguments, gained for his views, and for their consequences, almost\r\nuniversal acceptance.\r\n\r\nRedi did not trouble himself much with speculative considerations, but\r\nattacked particular cases of what was supposed to be \"spontaneous\r\ngeneration\" experimentally. Here are dead animals, or pieces of meat,\r\nsays he; I expose them to the air in hot weather, and in a few days they\r\nswarm with maggots. You tell me that these are generated in the dead\r\nflesh; but if I put similar bodies, while quite fresh, into a jar, and\r\ntie some fine gauze over the top of the jar, not a maggot makes its\r\nappearance, while the dead substances, nevertheless, putrefy just in the\r\nsame way as before. It is obvious, therefore, that the maggots are not\r\ngenerated by the corruption of the meat; and that the cause of their\r\nformation must be a something which is kept away by gauze. But gauze will\r\nnot keep away aëriform bodies, or fluids. This something must, therefore,\r\nexist in the form of solid particles too big to get through the gauze.\r\nNor is one long left in doubt what these solid particles are; for the\r\nblowflies, attracted by the odour of the meat, swarm round the vessel,\r\nand, urged by a powerful but in this case misleading instinct, lay eggs\r\nout of which maggots are immediately hatched, upon the gauze. The\r\nconclusion, therefore, is unavoidable; the maggots are not generated by\r\nthe meat, but the eggs which give rise to them are brought through the\r\nair by the flies.\r\n\r\nThese experiments seem almost childishly simple, and one wonders how it\r\nwas that no one ever thought of them before. Simple as they are, however,\r\nthey are worthy of the most careful study, for every piece of\r\nexperimental work since done, in regard to this subject, has been shaped\r\nupon the model furnished by the Italian philosopher. As the results of\r\nhis experiments were the same, however varied the nature of the materials\r\nhe used, it is not wonderful that there arose in Redi's mind a\r\npresumption, that, in all such cases of the seeming production of life\r\nfrom dead matter, the real explanation was the introduction of living\r\ngerms from without into that dead matter.[4] And thus the hypothesis that\r\nliving matter always arises by the agency of pre-existing living matter,\r\ntook definite shape; and had, henceforward, a right to be considered and\r\na claim to be refuted, in each particular case, before the production of\r\nliving matter in any other way could be admitted by careful reasoners. It\r\nwill be necessary for me to refer to this hypothesis so frequently, that,\r\nto save circumlocution, I shall call it the hypothesis of _Biogenesis_;\r\nand I shall term the contrary doctrine--that living matter may be\r\nproduced by not living matter--the hypothesis of _Abiogenesis_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"Pure contentandomi sempre in questa ed in ciascuna altro\r\ncosa, da ciascuno più savio, là dove io difettuosamente parlassi, esser\r\ncorretto; non tacero, che per molte osservazioni molti volti da me fatte,\r\nmi sento inclinato a credere che la terra, da quelle prime piante, e da\r\nquei primi animali in poi, che ella nei primi giorni del mondo produsse\r\nper comandemento del sovrano ed omnipotente Fattore, non abbia mai più\r\nprodotto da se medesima nè erba nè albero, nè animale alcuno perfetto o\r\nimperfetto che ei se fosse; e che tutto quello, che ne' tempi trapassati\r\nè nato e che ora nascere in lei, o da lei veggiamo, venga tutto dalla\r\nsemenza reale e vera delle piante, e degli animali stessi, i quali col\r\nmezzo del proprio seme la loro spezie conservano. E se bene tutto giorno\r\nscorghiamo da' cadaveri degli animali, e da tutte quante le maniere dell'\r\nerbe, e de' fiori, e dei frutti imputriditi, e corrotti nascere vermi\r\ninfiniti--\r\n\r\n'Nonne vides quaecunque mora, fluidoque calore\r\nCorpora tabescunt in parva animalia verti'--\r\n\r\nIo mi sento, dico, inclinato, a credere che tutti quei vermi si generino\r\ndal seme paterno; e che le carni, e l' erbe, e l' altre cose tutte\r\nputrefatte, o putrefattibili non facciano altra parte, nè abbiano altro\r\nufizio nella generazione degl' insetti, se non d'apprestare un luogo o un\r\nnido proporzionato, in cui dagli animali nel tempo della figliatura sieno\r\nportati, e partoriti i vermi, o l' uova o l' altre semenze dei vermi, i\r\nquali tosto che nati sono, trovano in esso nido un sufficiente alimento\r\nabilissimo per nutricarsi: e se in quello non son portate dalle madri\r\nqueste suddette semenze, niente mai, e replicatamente niente, vi s'\r\ningegneri e nasca.\"--REDI, _Esperienze_, pp. 14-16.]\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, as I have said, the latter was the dominant\r\nview, sanctioned alike by antiquity and by authority; and it is\r\ninteresting to observe that Redi did not escape the customary tax upon a\r\ndiscoverer of having to defend himself against the charge of impugning\r\nthe authority of the Scriptures;[5] for his adversaries declared that the\r\ngeneration of bees from the carcase of a dead lion is affirmed, in the\r\nBook of Judges, to have been the origin of the famous riddle with which\r\nSamson perplexed the Philistines:--\r\n\r\nOut of the eater came forth meat,\r\nAnd out of the strong came forth sweetness.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"Molti, e molti altri ancora vi potrei annoverare, se non\r\nfossi chiamato a rispondere alle rampogne di alcuni, che bruscamente mi\r\nrammentano ciò, che si legge nel capitolo quattordicesimo del sacrosanto\r\nLibro de' giudici ... \"--REDI, _loc. cit._ p. 45.]\r\n\r\nAgainst all odds, however, Redi, strong with the strength of demonstrable\r\nfact, did splendid battle for Biogenesis; but it is remarkable that he\r\nheld the doctrine in a sense which, if he lead lived in these times,\r\nwould have infallibly caused him to be classed among the defenders of\r\n\"spontaneous generation.\" \"Omne vivum ex vivo,\" \"no life without\r\nantecedent life,\" aphoristically sums up Redi's doctrine; but he went no\r\nfurther. It is most remarkable evidence of the philosophic caution and\r\nimpartiality of his mind, that although he had speculatively anticipated\r\nthe manner in which grubs really are deposited in fruits and in the galls\r\nof plants, he deliberately admits that the evidence is insufficient to\r\nbear him out; and he therefore prefers the supposition that they are\r\ngenerated by a modification of the living substance of the plants\r\nthemselves. Indeed, he regards these vegetable growths as organs, by\r\nmeans of which the plant gives rise to an animal, and looks upon this\r\nproduction of specific animals as the final cause of the galls and of, at\r\nany rate, some fruits. And he proposes to explain the occurrence of\r\nparasites within the animal body in the same way.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The passage (_Esperienze_, p. 129) is worth quoting in\r\nfull:--\r\n\r\n\"Se dovessi palesarvi il mio sentimento crederei che i frutti, i legumi,\r\ngli alberi e le foglie, in due maniere inverminassero. Una, perchè\r\nvenendo i bachi per dí fuora, e cercando l' alimento, col rodere ci\r\naprono la strada, ed arrivano alla più interna midolla de' frutti e de'\r\nlegni. L'altra maniera si è, che io per me stimerei, che non fosse gran\r\nfatto disdicevole il credere, che quell' anima o quella virtù, la quale\r\ngenera i fiori ed i frutti nelle piante viventi, sia quella stessa che\r\ngeneri ancora i bachi di esse piante. E chi sà, forse, che molti frutti\r\ndegli alberi non sieno prodotti, non per un fine primario e principale,\r\nma bensi per un uffizio secondario e servile, destinato alla generazione\r\ndi que' vermi, servendo a loro in vece di matrice, in cui dimorino un\r\nprefisso e determinato tempo; il quale arrivato escan fuora a godere il\r\nsole.\r\n\r\n\"Io m' immagino, che questo mio pensiero non vi parrà totalmento un\r\nparadosso; mentro farete riflessione a quelle tanto sorte di galle, di\r\ngallozzole, di coccole, di ricci, di calici, di cornetti ed i lappole,\r\nche son produtte dalle quercel, dalle farnie, da' cerri, da' sugheri, da'\r\nleeci e da altri simili alberi de ghianda; imperciocchè in quello\r\ngallozzole, e particolarmente nelle più grosse, che si chiamano coronati,\r\nne' ricci capelluti, che ciuffoli da' nostri contadini son detti; nei\r\nricci legnosi del cerro, ne' ricci stellati della quercia, nelle galluzze\r\ndella foglia del leccio si vede evidentissimamente, che la prima e\r\nprincipale intenzione della natura è formare dentro di quelle un animale\r\nvolante; vedendosi nel centro della gallozzola un uovo, che col crescere\r\ne col maturarsi di essa gallozzola va crescendo e maturando anch' egli, e\r\ncresce altresi a suo tempo quel verme, che nell' uovo si racchiude; il\r\nqual verme, quando la gallozzola è finita di maturare e che è venuto il\r\ntermine destinato al suo nascimento, diventa, di verme che era, una\r\nmosca.... Io vi confesso ingenuamente, che prima d'aver fatte queste mie\r\nesperienze intorno alla generazione degl' insetti mi dava a credere, o\r\nper dir meglio sospettava, che forse la gallozzola nascesse, perchè\r\narrivando la mosca nel tempo della primavera, e facendo una piccolissima\r\nfessura ne' rami più teneri della quercia, in quella fessura nascondesse\r\nuno de suoi semi, il quale fosse cagione che sbocciasse fuora la\r\ngallozzola; e che mai non si vedessero galle o gallozzole o ricci o\r\ncornetti o calici o coccole, se non in que' rami, ne' quali le mosche\r\navessero depositate le loro semenze; e mi dava ad intendere, che le\r\ngallozzole fossero una malattia cagionata nelle querce dalle punture\r\ndelle mosche, in quella giusa stessa che dalle punture d'altri animaletti\r\nsimiglievoli veggiamo crescere de' tumori ne' corpi degli animali.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is of great importance to apprehend Redi's position rightly; for the\r\nlines of thought he laid down for us are those upon which naturalists\r\nhave been working ever since. Clearly, he held _Biogenesis_ as against\r\n_Abiogenesis;_ and I shall immediately proceed, in the first place, to\r\ninquire how far subsequent investigation has borne him out in so doing.\r\n\r\nBut Redi also thought that there were two modes of Biogenesis. By the one\r\nmethod, which is that of common and ordinary occurrence, the living\r\nparent gives rise to offspring which passes through the same cycle of\r\nchanges as itself--like gives rise to like; and this has been termed\r\n_Homogenesis_. By the other mode, the living parent was supposed to give\r\nrise to offspring which passed through a totally different series of\r\nstates from those exhibited by the parent, and did not return into the\r\ncycle of the parent; this is what ought to be called _Heterogenesis_, the\r\noffspring being altogether, and permanently, unlike the parent. The term\r\nHeterogenesis, however, has unfortunately been used in a different sense,\r\nand M. Milne-Edwards has therefore substituted for it _Xenogenesis_,\r\nwhich means the generation of something foreign. After discussing Redi's\r\nhypothesis of universal Biogenesis, then, I shall go on to ask how far\r\nthe growth of science justifies his other hypothesis of Xenogenesis.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the hypothesis of Biogenesis was triumphant and unchecked\r\nfor nearly a century. The application of the microscope to anatomy in the\r\nhands of Grew, Leeuwenhoek, Swammerdam, Lyonnet, Vallisnieri, Réaurnur,\r\nand other illustrious investigators of nature of that day, displayed such\r\na complexity of organisation in the lowest and minutest forms, and\r\neverywhere revealed such a prodigality of provision for their\r\nmultiplication by germs of one sort or another, that the hypothesis of\r\nAbiogenesis began to appear not only untrue, but absurd; and, in the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century, when Needham and Buffon took up the\r\nquestion, it was almost universally discredited.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Needham, writing in 1750, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Les naturalistes modernes s'accordent unaninement à établir, comme une\r\nvérité certaine, que toute plante vient do sa sémence spécifique, tout\r\nanimal d'un oeuf ou de quelque chose d'analogue préexistant dans la\r\nplante, ou dans l'animal de même espèce qui l'a produit.\"--_Nouvelles\r\nObservations_, p. 169.\r\n\r\n\"Les naturalistes out généralemente cru que les animaux microscopiques\r\nétaient engendrés par des oeufs transportés dans l'air, ou déposés dans\r\ndes eaux dormantes par des insectes volans.\"--_Ibid._ p. 176.]\r\n\r\nBut the skill of the microscope makers of the eighteenth century soon\r\nreached its limit. A microscope magnifying 400 diameters was a _chef\r\nd'oeuvre_ of the opticians of that day; and, at the same time, by no\r\nmeans trustworthy. But a magnifying power of 400 diameters, even when\r\ndefinition reaches the exquisite perfection of our modern achromatic\r\nlenses, hardly suffices for the mere discernment of the smallest forms of\r\nlife. A speck, only 1/25th of an inch in diameter, has, at ten inches\r\nfrom the eye, the same apparent size as an object 1/10000th of an inch in\r\ndiameter, when magnified 400 times; but forms of living matter abound,\r\nthe diameter of which is not more than 1/40000th of an inch. A filtered\r\ninfusion of hay, allowed to stand for two days, will swarm with living\r\nthings among which, any which reaches the diameter of a human red blood-\r\ncorpuscle, or about 1/3200th of an inch, is a giant. It is only by\r\nbearing these facts in mind, that we can deal fairly with the remarkable\r\nstatements and speculations put forward by Buffon and Needham in the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nWhen a portion of any animal or vegetable body is infused in water, it\r\ngradually softens and disintegrates; and, as it does so, the water is\r\nfound to swarm with minute active creatures, the so-called Infusorial\r\nAnimalcules, none of which can be seen, except by the aid of the\r\nmicroscope; while a large proportion belong to the category of smallest\r\nthings of which I have spoken, and which must have looked like mere dots\r\nand lines under the ordinary microscopes of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nLed by various theoretical considerations which I cannot now discuss, but\r\nwhich looked promising enough in the lights of their time, Buffon and\r\nNeedham doubted the applicability of Redi's hypothesis to the infusorial\r\nanimalcules, and Needham very properly endeavoured to put the question to\r\nan experimental test. He said to himself, If these infusorial animalcules\r\ncome from germs, their germs must exist either in the substance infused,\r\nor in the water with which the infusion is made, or in the superjacent\r\nair. Now the vitality of all germs is destroyed by heat. Therefore, if I\r\nboil the infusion, cork it up carefully, cementing the cork over with\r\nmastic, and then heat the whole vessel by heaping hot ashes over it, I\r\nmust needs kill whatever germs are present. Consequently, if Redi's\r\nhypothesis hold good, when the infusion is taken away and allowed to\r\ncool, no animalcules ought to be developed in it; whereas, if the\r\nanimalcules are not dependent on pre-existing germs, but are generated\r\nfrom the infused substance, they ought, by and by, to make their\r\nappearance. Needham found that, under the circumstances in which he made\r\nhis experiments, animalcules always did arise in the infusions, when a\r\nsufficient time had elapsed to allow for their development.\r\n\r\nIn much of his work Needham was associated with Buffon, and the results\r\nof their experiments fitted in admirably with the great French\r\nnaturalist's hypothesis of \"organic molecules,\" according to which, life\r\nis the indefeasible property of certain indestructible molecules of\r\nmatter, which exist in all living things, and have inherent activities by\r\nwhich they are distinguished from not living matter. Each individual\r\nliving organism is formed by their temporary combination. They stand to\r\nit in the relation of the particles of water to a cascade, or a\r\nwhirlpool; or to a mould, into which the water is poured. The form of the\r\norganism is thus determined by the reaction between external conditions\r\nand the inherent activities of the organic molecules of which it is\r\ncomposed; and, as the stoppage of a whirlpool destroys nothing but a\r\nform, and leaves the molecules of the water, with all their inherent\r\nactivities intact, so what we call the death and putrefaction of an\r\nanimal, or of a plant, is merely the breaking up of the form, or manner\r\nof association, of its constituent organic molecules, which are then set\r\nfree as infusorial animalcules.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that this doctrine is by no means identical with\r\n_Abiogenesis_, with which it is often confounded. On this hypothesis, a\r\npiece of beef, or a handful of hay, is dead only in a limited sense. The\r\nbeef is dead ox, and the hay is dead grass; but the \"organic molecules\"\r\nof the beef or the hay are not dead, but are ready to manifest their\r\nvitality as soon as the bovine or herbaceous shrouds in which they are\r\nimprisoned are rent by the macerating action of water. The hypothesis\r\ntherefore must be classified under Xenogenesis, rather than under\r\nAbiogenesis. Such as it was, I think it will appear, to those who will be\r\njust enough to remember that it was propounded before the birth of modern\r\nchemistry, and of the modern optical arts, to be a most ingenious and\r\nsuggestive speculation.\r\n\r\nBut the great tragedy of Science--the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis\r\nby an ugly fact--which is so constantly being enacted under the eyes of\r\nphilosophers, was played, almost immediately, for the benefit of Buffon\r\nand Needham.\r\n\r\nOnce more, an Italian, the Abbé Spallanzani, a worthy successor and\r\nrepresentative of Redi in his acuteness, his ingenuity, and his learning,\r\nsubjected the experiments and the conclusions of Needham to a searching\r\ncriticism. It might be true that Needham's experiments yielded results\r\nsuch as he had described, but did they bear out his arguments? Was it not\r\npossible, in the first place, he had not completely excluded the air by\r\nhis corks and mastic? And was it not possible, in the second place, that\r\nhe had not sufficiently heated his infusions and the superjacent air?\r\nSpallanzani joined issue with the English naturalist on both these pleas,\r\nand he showed that if, in the first place, the glass vessels in which the\r\ninfusions were contained were hermetically sealed by fusing their necks,\r\nand if, in the second place, they were exposed to the temperature of\r\nboiling water for three-quarters of an hour,[8] no animalcules ever made\r\ntheir appearance within them. It must be admitted that the experiments\r\nand arguments of Spallanzani furnish a complete and a crushing reply to\r\nthose of Needham. But we all too often forget that it is one thing to\r\nrefute a proposition, and another to prove the truth of a doctrine which,\r\nimplicitly or explicitly, contradicts that proposition; and the advance\r\nof science soon showed that though Needham might be quite wrong, it did\r\nnot follow that Spallanzani was quite right.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See Spallanzani, _Opere_, vi. pp. 42 and 51.]\r\n\r\nModern Chemistry, the birth of the latter half of the eighteenth century,\r\ngrew apace, and soon found herself face to face with the great problems\r\nwhich biology had vainly tried to attack without her help. The discovery\r\nof oxygen led to the laying of the foundations of a scientific theory of\r\nrespiration, and to an examination of the marvellous interactions of\r\norganic substances with oxygen. The presence of free oxygen appeared to\r\nbe one of the conditions of the existence of life, and of those singular\r\nchanges in organic matters which are known as fermentation and\r\nputrefaction. The question of the generation of the infusory animalcules\r\nthus passed into a new phase. For what might not have happened to the\r\norganic matter of the infusions, or to the oxygen of the air, in\r\nSpallanzani's experiments? What security was there that the development\r\nof life which ought to have taken place had not been checked or prevented\r\nby these changes?\r\n\r\nThe battle had to be fought again. It was needful to repeat the\r\nexperiments under conditions which would make sure that neither the\r\noxygen of the air, nor the composition of the organic matter, was altered\r\nin such a manner as to interfere with the existence of life.\r\n\r\nSchulze and Schwann took up the question from this point of view in 1836\r\nand 1837. The passage of air through red-hot glass tubes, or through\r\nstrong sulphuric acid, does not alter the proportion of its oxygen, while\r\nit must needs arrest, or destroy, any organic matter which may be\r\ncontained in the air. These experimenters, therefore, contrived\r\narrangements by which the only air which should come into contact with a\r\nboiled infusion should be such as had either passed through red-hot tubes\r\nor through strong sulphuric acid. The result which they obtained was that\r\nan infusion so treated developed no living things, while, if the same\r\ninfusion was afterwards exposed to the air, such things appeared rapidly\r\nand abundantly. The accuracy of these experiments has been alternately\r\ndenied and affirmed. Supposing then, to be accepted, however, all that\r\nthey really proved was that the treatment to which the air was subjected\r\ndestroyed _something_ that was essential to the development of life in\r\nthe infusion. This \"something\" might be gaseous, fluid, or solid; that it\r\nconsisted of germs remained only an hypothesis of greater or less\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with these investigations a remarkable discovery was\r\nmade by Cagniard de la Tour. He found that common yeast is composed of a\r\nvast accumulation of minute plants. The fermentation of must, or of wort,\r\nin the fabrication of wine and of beer, is always accompanied by the\r\nrapid growth and multiplication of these _Toruloe_. Thus, fermentation,\r\nin so far as it was accompanied by the development of microscopical\r\norganisms in enormous numbers, became assimilated to the decomposition of\r\nan infusion of ordinary animal or vegetable matter; and it was an obvious\r\nsuggestion that the organisms were, in some way or other, the causes both\r\nof fermentation and of putrefaction. The chemists, with Berzelius and\r\nLiebig at their head, at first laughed this idea to scorn; but in 1843, a\r\nman then very young, who has since performed the unexampled feat of\r\nattaining to high eminence alike in Mathematics, Physics, and Physiology--\r\nI speak of the illustrious Helmholtz--reduced the matter to the test of\r\nexperiment by a method alike elegant and conclusive. Helmholtz separated\r\na putrefying or a fermenting liquid from one which was simply putrescible\r\nor fermentable by a membrane which allowed the fluids to pass through and\r\nbecome intermixed, but stopped the passage of solids. The result was,\r\nthat while the putrescible or the fermentable liquids became impregnated\r\nwith the results of the putrescence or fermentation which was going on on\r\nthe other side of the membrane, they neither putrefied (in the ordinary\r\nway) nor fermented; nor were any of the organisms which abounded in the\r\nfermenting or putrefying liquid generated in them. Therefore the cause of\r\nthe development of these organisms must lie in something which cannot\r\npass through membranes; and as Helmholtz's investigations were long\r\nantecedent to Graham's researches upon colloids, his natural conclusion\r\nwas that the agent thus intercepted must be a solid material. In point of\r\nfact, Helmholtz's experiments narrowed the issue to this: that which\r\nexcites fermentation and putrefaction, and at the same time gives rise to\r\nliving forms in a fermentable or putrescible fluid, is not a gas and is\r\nnot a diffusible fluid; therefore it is either a colloid, or it is matter\r\ndivided into very minute solid particles.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Schroeder and Dusch in 1854, and of Schroeder alone, in\r\n1859, cleared up this point by experiments which are simply refinements\r\nupon those of Redi. A lump of cotton-wool is, physically speaking, a pile\r\nof many thicknesses of a very fine gauze, the fineness of the meshes of\r\nwhich depends upon the closeness of the compression of the wool. Now,\r\nSchroeder and Dusch found, that, in the case of all the putrefiable\r\nmaterials which they used (except milk and yolk of egg), an infusion\r\nboiled, and then allowed to come into contact with no air but such as had\r\nbeen filtered through cotton-wool, neither putrefied, nor fermented, nor\r\ndeveloped living forms. It is hard to imagine what the fine sieve formed\r\nby the cotton-wool could have stopped except minute solid particles.\r\nStill the evidence was incomplete until it had been positively shown,\r\nfirst, that ordinary air does contain such particles; and, secondly, that\r\nfiltration through cotton-wool arrests these particles and allows only\r\nphysically pure air to pass. This demonstration has been furnished within\r\nthe last year by the remarkable experiments of Professor Tyndall. It has\r\nbeen a common objection of Abiogenists that, if the doctrine of Biogeny\r\nis true, the air must be thick with germs; and they regard this as the\r\nheight of absurdity. But nature occasionally is exceedingly unreasonable,\r\nand Professor Tyndall has proved that this particular absurdity may\r\nnevertheless be a reality. He has demonstrated that ordinary air is no\r\nbetter than a sort of stirabout of excessively minute solid particles;\r\nthat these particles are almost wholly destructible by heat; and that\r\nthey are strained off, and the air rendered optically pure, by its being\r\npassed through cotton-wool.\r\n\r\nIt remains yet in the order of logic, though not of history, to show that\r\namong these solid destructible particles, there really do exist germs\r\ncapable of giving rise to the development of living forms in suitable\r\nmenstrua. This piece of work was done by M. Pasteur in those beautiful\r\nresearches which will ever render his name famous; and which, in spite of\r\nall attacks upon them, appear to me now, as they did seven years ago,[9]\r\nto be models of accurate experimentation and logical reasoning. He\r\nstrained air through cotton-wool, and found, as Schroeder and Dusch had\r\ndone, that it contained nothing competent to give rise to the development\r\nof life in fluids highly fitted for that purpose. But the important\r\nfurther links in the chain of evidence added by Pasteur are three. In the\r\nfirst place he subjected to microscopic examination the cotton-wool which\r\nhad served as strainer, and found that sundry bodies clearly recognisable\r\nas germs, were among the solid particles strained off. Secondly, he\r\nproved that these germs were competent to give rise to living forms by\r\nsimply sowing them in a solution fitted for their development. And,\r\nthirdly, he showed that the incapacity of air strained through cotton-\r\nwool to give rise to life, was not due to any occult change effected in\r\nthe constituents of the air by the wool, by proving that the cotton-wool\r\nmight be dispensed with altogether, and perfectly free access left\r\nbetween the exterior air and that in the experimental flask. If the neck\r\nof the flask is drawn out into a tube and bent downwards; and if, after\r\nthe contained fluid has been carefully boiled, the tube is heated\r\nsufficiently to destroy any germs which may be present in the air which\r\nenters as the fluid cools, the apparatus may be left to itself for any\r\ntime and no life will appear in the fluid. The reason is plain. Although\r\nthere is free communication between the atmosphere laden with germs and\r\nthe germless air in the flask, contact between the two takes place only\r\nin the tube; and as the germs cannot fall upwards, and there are no\r\ncurrents, they never reach the interior of the flask. But if the tube be\r\nbroken short off where it proceeds from the flask, and free access be\r\nthus given to germs falling vertically out of the air, the fluid, which\r\nhas remained clear and desert for months, becomes, in a few days, turbid\r\nand full of life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Lectures to Working Men on the Causes of the Phenomena of\r\nOrganic Nature_, 1863. (See Vol. II. of these Essays.)]\r\n\r\nThese experiments have been repeated over and over again by independent\r\nobservers with entire success; and there is one very simple mode of\r\nseeing the facts for one's self, which I may as well describe.\r\n\r\nPrepare a solution (much used by M. Pasteur, and often called \"Pasteur's\r\nsolution\") composed of water with tartrate of ammonia, sugar, and yeast-\r\nash dissolved therein.[10] Divide it into three portions in as many\r\nflasks; boil all three for a quarter of an hour; and, while the steam is\r\npassing out, stop the neck of one with a large plug of cotton-wool, so\r\nthat this also may be thoroughly steamed. Now set the flasks aside to\r\ncool, and, when their contents are cold, add to one of the open ones a\r\ndrop of filtered infusion of hay which has stood for twenty-four hours,\r\nand is consequently hill of the active and excessively minute organisms\r\nknown as _Bacteria_. In a couple of days of ordinary warm weather the\r\ncontents of this flask will be milky from the enormous multiplication of\r\n_Bacteria_. The other flask, open and exposed to the air, will, sooner or\r\nlater, become milky with _Bacteria_, and patches of mould may appear in\r\nit; while the liquid in the flask, the neck of which is plugged with\r\ncotton-wool, will remain clear for an indefinite time. I have sought in\r\nvain for any explanation of these facts, except the obvious one, that the\r\nair contains germs competent to give rise to _Bacteria_, such as those\r\nwith which the first solution has been knowingly and purposely\r\ninoculated, and to the mould-_Fungi_. And I have not yet been able to\r\nmeet with any advocate of Abiogenesis who seriously maintains that the\r\natoms of sugar, tartrate of ammonia, yeast-ash, and water, under no\r\ninfluence but that of free access of air and the ordinary temperature,\r\nre-arrange themselves and give rise to the protoplasm of _Bacterium_. But\r\nthe alternative is to admit that these _Bacteria_ arise from germs in the\r\nair; and if they are thus propagated, the burden of proof that other like\r\nforms are generated in a different manner, must rest with the assertor of\r\nthat proposition.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Infusion of hay treated in the same way yields similar\r\nresults; but as it contains organic matter, the argument which follows\r\ncannot be based upon it.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up the effect of this long chain of evidence:--\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrable that a fluid eminently fit for the development of the\r\nlowest forms of life, but which contains neither germs, nor any protein\r\ncompound, gives rise to living things in great abundance if it is exposed\r\nto ordinary air; while no such development takes place, if the air with\r\nwhich it is in contact is mechanically freed from the solid particles\r\nwhich ordinarily float in it, and which may be made visible by\r\nappropriate means.\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrable that the great majority of these particles are\r\ndestructible by heat, and that some of them are germs, or living\r\nparticles, capable of giving rise to the same forms of life as those\r\nwhich appear when the fluid is exposed to unpurified air.\r\n\r\nIt is demonstrable that inoculation of the experimental fluid with a drop\r\nof liquid known to contain living particles gives rise to the same\r\nphenomena as exposure to unpurified air.\r\n\r\nAnd it is further certain that these living particles are so minute that\r\nthe assumption of their suspension in ordinary air presents not the\r\nslightest difficulty. On the contrary, considering their lightness and\r\nthe wide diffusion of the organisms which produce them, it is impossible\r\nto conceive that they should not be suspended in the atmosphere in\r\nmyriads.\r\n\r\nThus the evidence, direct and indirect, in favour of _Biogenesis_ for all\r\nknown forms of life must, I think, be admitted to be of great weight.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, the sole assertions worthy of attention are that\r\nhermetically sealed fluids, which have been exposed to great and long-\r\ncontinued heat, have sometimes exhibited living forms of low organisation\r\nwhen they have been opened.\r\n\r\nThe first reply that suggests itself is the probability that there must\r\nbe some error about these experiments, because they are performed on an\r\nenormous scale every day with quite contrary results. Meat, fruits,\r\nvegetables, the very materials of the most fermentable and putrescible\r\ninfusions, are preserved to the extent, I suppose I may say, of thousands\r\nof tons every year, by a method which is a mere application of\r\nSpallanzani's experiment. The matters to be preserved are well boiled in\r\na tin case provided with a small hole, and this hole is soldered up when\r\nall the air in the case has been replaced by steam. By this method they\r\nmay be kept for years without putrefying, fermenting, or getting mouldy.\r\nNow this is not because oxygen is excluded, inasmuch as it is now proved\r\nthat free oxygen is not necessary for either fermentation or\r\nputrefaction. It is not because the tins are exhausted of air, for\r\n_Vibriones_ and _Bacteria_ live, as Pasteur has shown, without air or\r\nfree oxygen. It is not because the boiled meats or vegetables are not\r\nputrescible or fermentable, as those who have had the misfortune to be in\r\na ship supplied with unskilfully closed tins well know. What is it,\r\ntherefore, but the exclusion of germs? I think that Abiogenists are bound\r\nto answer this question before they ask us to consider new experiments of\r\nprecisely the same order.\r\n\r\nAnd in the next place, if the results of the experiments I refer to are\r\nreally trustworthy, it by no means follows that Abiogenesis has taken\r\nplace. The resistance of living matter to heat is known to vary within\r\nconsiderable limits, and to depend, to some extent, upon the chemical and\r\nphysical qualities of the surrounding medium. But if, in the present\r\nstate of science, the alternative is offered us,--either germs can stand\r\na greater heat than has been supposed, or the molecules of dead matter,\r\nfor no valid or intelligible reason that is assigned, are able to re-\r\narrange themselves into living bodies, exactly such as can be\r\ndemonstrated to be frequently produced in another way,--I cannot\r\nunderstand how choice can be, even for a moment, doubtful.\r\n\r\nBut though I cannot express this conviction of mine too strongly, I must\r\ncarefully guard myself against the supposition that I intend to suggest\r\nthat no such thing as Abiogenesis ever has taken place in the past, or\r\never will take place in the future. With organic chemistry, molecular\r\nphysics, and physiology yet in their infancy, and every day making\r\nprodigious strides, I think it would be the height of presumption for any\r\nman to say that the conditions under which matter assumes the properties\r\nwe call \"vital\" may not, some day, be artificially brought together. All\r\nI feel justified in affirming is, that I see no reason for believing that\r\nthe feat has been performed yet.\r\n\r\nAnd looking back through the prodigious vista of the past, I find no\r\nrecord of the commencement of life, and therefore I am devoid of any\r\nmeans of forming a definite conclusion as to the conditions of its\r\nappearance. Belief, in the scientific sense of the word, is a serious\r\nmatter, and needs strong foundations. To say, therefore, in the admitted\r\nabsence of evidence, that I have any belief as to the mode in which the\r\nexisting forms of life have originated, would be using words in a wrong\r\nsense. But expectation is permissible where belief is not; and if it were\r\ngiven me to look beyond the abyss of geologically recorded time to the\r\nstill more remote period when the earth was passing through physical and\r\nchemical conditions, which it can no more see again than a man can recall\r\nhis infancy, I should expect to be a witness of the evolution of living\r\nprotoplasm from not living matter. I should expect to see it appear under\r\nforms of great simplicity, endowed, like existing fungi, with the power\r\nof determining the formation of new protoplasm from such matters as\r\nammonium carbonates, oxalates and tartrates, alkaline and earthy\r\nphosphates, and water, without the aid of light. That is the expectation\r\nto which analogical reasoning leads me; but I beg you once more to\r\nrecollect that I have no right to call my opinion anything but an act of\r\nphilosophical faith.\r\n\r\nSo much for the history of the progress of Redi's great doctrine of\r\nBiogenesis, which appears to me, with the limitations I have expressed,\r\nto be victorious along the whole line at the present day.\r\n\r\nAs regards the second problem offered to us by Redi, whether Xenogenesis\r\nobtains, side by side with Homogenesis,--whether, that is, there exist\r\nnot only the ordinary living things, giving rise to offspring which run\r\nthrough the same cycle as themselves, but also others, producing\r\noffspring which are of a totally different character from themselves,--\r\nthe researches of two centuries have led to a different result. That the\r\ngrubs found in galls are no product of the plants on which the galls\r\ngrow, but are the result of the introduction of the eggs of insects into\r\nthe substance of these plants, was made out by Vallisnieri, Réaumur, and\r\nothers, before the end of the first half of the eighteenth century. The\r\ntapeworms, bladderworms, and flukes continued to be a stronghold of the\r\nadvocates of Xenogenesis for a much longer period. Indeed, it is only\r\nwithin the last thirty years that the splendid patience of Von Siebold,\r\nVan Beneden, Leuckart, Küchenmeister, and other helminthologists, has\r\nsucceeded in tracing every such parasite, often through the strangest\r\nwanderings and metamorphoses, to an egg derived from a parent, actually\r\nor potentially like itself; and the tendency of inquiries elsewhere has\r\nall been in the same direction. A plant may throw off bulbs, but these,\r\nsooner or later, give rise to seeds or spores, which develop into the\r\noriginal form. A polype may give rise to Medusae, or a pluteus to an\r\nEchinoderm, but the Medusa and the Echinoderm give rise to eggs which\r\nproduce polypes or glutei, and they are therefore only stages in the\r\ncycle of life of the species.\r\n\r\nBut if we turn to pathology, it offers us some remarkable approximations\r\nto true Xenogenesis.\r\n\r\nAs I have already mentioned, it has been known since the time of\r\nVallisnieri and of Réaumur, that galls in plants, and tumours in cattle,\r\nare caused by insects, which lay their eggs in those parts of the animal\r\nor vegetable frame of which these morbid structures are outgrowths.\r\nAgain, it is a matter of familiar experience to everybody that mere\r\npressure on the skin will give rise to a corn. Now the gall, the tumour,\r\nand the corn are parts of the living body, which have become, to a\r\ncertain degree, independent and distinct organisms. Under the influence\r\nof certain external conditions, elements of the body, which should have\r\ndeveloped in due subordination to its general plan, set up for themselves\r\nand apply the nourishment which they receive to their own purposes.\r\n\r\nFrom such innocent productions as corns and warts, there are all\r\ngradations to the serious tumours which, by their mere size and the\r\nmechanical obstruction they cause, destroy the organism out of which they\r\nare developed; while, finally, in those terrible structures known as\r\ncancers, the abnormal growth has acquired powers of reproduction and\r\nmultiplication, and is only morphologically distinguishable from the\r\nparasitic worm, the life of which is neither more nor less closely bound\r\nup with that of the infested organism.\r\n\r\nIf there were a kind of diseased structure, the histological elements of\r\nwhich were capable of maintaining a separate and independent existence\r\nout of the body, it seems to me that the shadowy boundary between morbid\r\ngrowth and Xenogenesis would be effaced. And I am inclined to think that\r\nthe progress of discovery has almost brought us to this point already. I\r\nhave been favoured by Mr. Simon with an early copy of the last published\r\nof the valuable \"Reports on the Public Health,\" which, in his capacity of\r\ntheir medical officer, he annually presents to the Lords of the Privy\r\nCouncil. The appendix to this report contains an introductory essay \"On\r\nthe Intimate Pathology of Contagion,\" by Dr. Burdon-Sanderson, which is\r\none of the clearest, most comprehensive, and well-reasoned discussions of\r\na great question which has come under my notice for a long time. I refer\r\nyou to it for details and for the authorities for the statements I am\r\nabout to make.\r\n\r\nYou are familiar with what happens in vaccination. A minute cut is made\r\nin the skin, and an infinitesimal quantity of vaccine matter is inserted\r\ninto the wound. Within a certain time a vesicle appears in the place of\r\nthe wound, and the fluid which distends this vesicle is vaccine matter,\r\nin quantity a hundred or a thousandfold that which was originally\r\ninserted. Now what has taken place in the course of this operation? Has\r\nthe vaccine matter, by its irritative property, produced a mere blister,\r\nthe fluid of which has the same irritative property? Or does the vaccine\r\nmatter contain living particles, which have grown and multiplied where\r\nthey have been planted? The observations of M. Chauveau, extended and\r\nconfirmed by Dr. Sanderson himself, appear to leave no doubt upon this\r\nhead. Experiments, similar in principle to those of Helmholtz on\r\nfermentation and putrefaction, have proved that the active element in the\r\nvaccine lymph is non-diffusible, and consists of minute particles not\r\nexceeding 1/20000th of an inch in diameter, which are made visible in the\r\nlymph by the microscope. Similar experiments have proved that two of the\r\nmost destructive of epizootic diseases, sheep-pox and glanders, are also\r\ndependent for their existence and their propagation upon extremely small\r\nliving solid particles, to which the title of _microzymes_ is applied. An\r\nanimal suffering under either of these terrible diseases is a source of\r\ninfection and contagion to others, for precisely the same reason as a tub\r\nof fermenting beer is capable of propagating its fermentation by\r\n\"infection,\" or \"contagion,\" to fresh wort. In both cases it is the solid\r\nliving particles which are efficient; the liquid in which they float, and\r\nat the expense of which they live, being altogether passive.\r\n\r\nNow arises the question, are these microzymes the results of\r\n_Homogenesis_, or of _Xenogenesis?_ are they capable, like the\r\n_Toruloe_ of yeast, of arising only by the development of pre-existing\r\ngerms? or may they be, like the constituents of a nut-gall, the results\r\nof a modification and individualisation of the tissues of the body in\r\nwhich they are found, resulting from the operation of certain conditions?\r\nAre they parasites in the zoological sense, or are they merely what\r\nVirchow has called \"heterologous growths\"? It is obvious that this\r\nquestion has the most profound importance, whether we look at it from a\r\npractical or from a theoretical point of view. A parasite may be stamped\r\nout by destroying its germs, but a pathological product can only be\r\nannihilated by removing the conditions which give rise to it.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that this great problem will have to be solved for each\r\nzymotic disease separately, for analogy cuts two ways. I have dwelt upon\r\nthe analogy of pathological modification, which is in favour of the\r\nxenogenetic origin of microzymes; but I must now speak of the equally\r\nstrong analogies in favour of the origin of such pestiferous particles by\r\nthe ordinary process of the generation of like from like.\r\n\r\nIt is, at present, a well-established fact that certain diseases, both of\r\nplants and of animals, which have all the characters of contagious and\r\ninfectious epidemics, are caused by minute organisms. The smut of wheat\r\nis a well-known instance of such a disease, and it cannot be doubted that\r\nthe grape-disease and the potato-disease fall under the same category.\r\nAmong animals, insects are wonderfully liable to the ravages of\r\ncontagious and infectious diseases caused by microscopic _Fungi_.\r\n\r\nIn autumn, it is not uncommon to see flies motionless upon a window-pane,\r\nwith a sort of magic circle, in white, drawn round them. On microscopic\r\nexamination, the magic circle is found to consist of innumerable spores,\r\nwhich have been thrown off in all directions by a minute fungus called\r\n_Empusa muscoe_, the spore-forming filaments of which stand out like a\r\npile of velvet from the body of the fly. These spore-forming filaments\r\nare connected with others which fill the interior of the fly's body like\r\nso much fine wool, having eaten away and destroyed the creature's\r\nviscera. This is the full-grown condition of the _Empusa_. If traced back\r\nto its earliest stages, in flies which are still active, and to all\r\nappearance healthy, it is found to exist in the form of minute corpuscles\r\nwhich float in the blood of the fly. These multiply and lengthen into\r\nfilaments, at the expense of the fly's substance; and when they have at\r\nlast killed the patient, they grow out of its body and give off spores.\r\nHealthy flies shut up with diseased ones catch this mortal disease, and\r\nperish like the others. A most competent observer, M. Cohn, who studied\r\nthe development of the _Empusa_ very carefully, was utterly unable to\r\ndiscover in what manner the smallest germs of the _Empusa_ got into the\r\nfly. The spores could not be made to give rise to such germs by\r\ncultivation; nor were such germs discoverable in the air, or in the food\r\nof the fly. It looked exceedingly like a case of Abiogenesis, or, at any\r\nrate, of Xenogenesis; and it is only quite recently that the real course\r\nof events has been made out. It has been ascertained, that when one of\r\nthe spores falls upon the body of a fly, it begins to germinate, and\r\nsends out a process which bores its way through the fly's skin; this,\r\nhaving reached the interior cavities of its body, gives off the minute\r\nfloating corpuscles which are the earliest stage of the _Empusa_. The\r\ndisease is \"contagious,\" because a healthy fly coming in contact with a\r\ndiseased one, from which the spore-bearing filaments protrude, is pretty\r\nsure to carry off a spore or two. It is \"infectious\" because the spores\r\nbecome scattered about all sorts of matter in the neighbourhood of the\r\nslain flies.\r\n\r\nThe silkworm has long been known to be subject to a very fatal and\r\ninfectious disease called the _Muscardine_. Audouin transmitted it by\r\ninoculation. This disease is entirely due to the development of a fungus,\r\n_Botrytis Bassiana_, in the body of the caterpillar; and its\r\ncontagiousness and infectiousness are accounted for in the same way as\r\nthose of the fly-disease. But, of late years, a still more serious\r\nepizootic has appeared among the silkworms; and I may mention a few facts\r\nwhich will give you some conception of the gravity of the injury which it\r\nhas inflicted on France alone.\r\n\r\nThe production of silk has been for centuries an important branch of\r\nindustry in Southern France, and in the year 1853 it had attained such a\r\nmagnitude that the annual produce of the French sericulture was estimated\r\nto amount to a tenth of that of the whole world, and represented a money-\r\nvalue of 117,000,000 francs, or nearly five millions sterling. What may\r\nbe the sum which would represent the money-value of all the industries\r\nconnected with the working up of the raw silk thus produced, is more than\r\nI can pretend to estimate. Suffice it to say, that the city of Lyons is\r\nbuilt upon French silk as much as Manchester was upon American cotton\r\nbefore the civil war.\r\n\r\nSilkworms are liable to many diseases; and, even before 1853, a peculiar\r\nepizootic, frequently accompanied by the appearance of dark spots upon\r\nthe skin (whence the name of \"Pébrine\" which it has received), had been\r\nnoted for its mortality. But in the years following 1853 this malady\r\nbroke out with such extreme violence, that, in 1858, the silk-crop was\r\nreduced to a third of the amount which it had reached in 1853; and, up\r\ntill within the last year or two, it has never attained half the yield of\r\n1853. This means not only that the great number of people engaged in silk\r\ngrowing are some thirty millions sterling poorer than they might have\r\nbeen; it means not only that high prices have had to be paid for imported\r\nsilkworm eggs, and that, after investing his money in them, in paying for\r\nmulberry-leaves and for attendance, the cultivator has constantly seen\r\nhis silkworms perish and himself plunged in ruin; but it means that the\r\nlooms of Lyons have lacked employment, and that, for years, enforced\r\nidleness and misery have been the portion of a vast population which, in\r\nformer days, was industrious and well-to-do.\r\n\r\nIn 1858 the gravity of the situation caused the French Academy of\r\nSciences to appoint Commissioners, of whom a distinguished naturalist, M.\r\nde Quatrefages, was one, to inquire into the nature of this disease, and,\r\nif possible, to devise some means of staying the plague. In reading the\r\nReport[11] made by M. de Quatrefages in 1859, it is exceedingly\r\ninteresting to observe that his elaborate study of the Pébrine forced the\r\nconviction upon his mind that, in its mode of occurrence and propagation,\r\nthe disease of the silkworm is, in every respect, comparable to the\r\ncholera among mankind. But it differs from the cholera, and so far is a\r\nmore formidable malady, in being hereditary, and in being, under some\r\ncircumstances, contagious as well as infectious.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: _Études sur les Maladies actuelles des Vers à Soie_, p.\r\n53.]\r\n\r\nThe Italian naturalist, Filippi, discovered in the blood of the silkworms\r\naffected by this strange disorder a multitude of cylindrical corpuscles,\r\neach about 1/6000th of an inch long. These have been carefully studied by\r\nLebert, and named by him _Panhistophyton_; for the reason that in\r\nsubjects in which the disease is strongly developed, the corpuscles swarm\r\nin every tissue and organ of the body, and even pass into the undeveloped\r\neggs of the female moth. But are these corpuscles causes, or mere\r\nconcomitants, of the disease? Some naturalists took one view and some\r\nanother; and it was not until the French Government, alarmed by the\r\ncontinued ravages of the malady, and the inefficiency of the remedies\r\nwhich had been suggested, despatched M. Pasteur to study it, that the\r\nquestion received its final settlement; at a great sacrifice, not only of\r\nthe time and peace of mind of that eminent philosopher, but, I regret to\r\nhave to add, of his health.\r\n\r\nBut the sacrifice has not been in vain. It is now certain that this\r\ndevastating, cholera-like, Pébrine, is the effect of the growth and\r\nmultiplication of the _Panhistophyton_ in the silkworm. It is contagious\r\nand infectious, because the corpuscles of the _Panhistophyton_ pass away\r\nfrom the bodies of the diseased caterpillars, directly or indirectly, to\r\nthe alimentary canal of healthy silkworms in their neighbourhood; it is\r\nhereditary because the corpuscles enter into the eggs while they are\r\nbeing formed, and consequently are carried within them when they are\r\nlaid; and for this reason, also, it presents the very singular\r\npeculiarity of being inherited only on the mother's side. There is not a\r\nsingle one of all the apparently capricious and unaccountable phenomena\r\npresented by the Pébrine, but has received its explanation from the fact\r\nthat the disease is the result of the presence of the microscopic\r\norganism, _Panhistophyton_.\r\n\r\nSuch being the facts with respect to the Pébrine, what are the\r\nindications as to the method of preventing it? It is obvious that this\r\ndepends upon the way in which the _Panhistophyton_ is generated. If it\r\nmay be generated by Abiogenesis, or by Xenogenesis, within the silkworm\r\nor its moth, the extirpation of the disease must depend upon the\r\nprevention of the occurrence of the conditions under which this\r\ngeneration takes place. But if, on the other hand, the _Panhistophyton_\r\nis an independent organism, which is no more generated by the silkworm\r\nthan the mistletoe is generated by the apple-tree or the oak on which it\r\ngrows, though it may need the silkworm for its development in the same\r\nway as the mistletoe needs the tree, then the indications are totally\r\ndifferent. The sole thing to be done is to get rid of and keep away the\r\ngerms of the _Panhistophyton_. As might be imagined, from the course of\r\nhis previous investigations, M. Pasteur was led to believe that the\r\nlatter was the right theory; and, guided by that theory, he has devised a\r\nmethod of extirpating the disease, which has proved to be completely\r\nsuccessful wherever it has been properly carried out.\r\n\r\nThere can be no reason, then, for doubting that, among insects,\r\ncontagious and infectious diseases, of great malignity, are caused by\r\nminute organisms which are produced from pre-existing germs, or by\r\nhomogenesis; and there is no reason, that I know of, for believing that\r\nwhat happens in insects may not take place in the highest animals.\r\nIndeed, there is already strong evidence that some diseases of an\r\nextremely malignant and fatal character to which man is subject, are as\r\nmuch the work of minute organisms as is the Pébrine. I refer for this\r\nevidence to the very striking facts adduced by Professor Lister in his\r\nvarious well-known publications on the antiseptic method of treatment. It\r\nappears to me impossible to rise from the perusal of those publications\r\nwithout a strong conviction that the lamentable mortality which so\r\nfrequently dogs the footsteps of the most skilful operator, and those\r\ndeadly consequences of wounds and injuries which seem to haunt the very\r\nwalls of great hospitals, and are, even now, destroying more men than die\r\nof bullet or bayonet, are due to the importation of minute organisms into\r\nwounds, and their increase and multiplication; and that the surgeon who\r\nsaves most lives will be he who best works out the practical consequences\r\nof the hypothesis of Redi.\r\n\r\nI commenced this Address by asking you to follow me in an attempt to\r\ntrace the path which has been followed by a scientific idea, in its long\r\nand slow progress from the position of a probable hypothesis to that of\r\nan established law of nature. Our survey has not taken us into very\r\nattractive regions; it has lain, chiefly, in a land flowing with the\r\nabominable, and peopled with mere grubs and mouldiness. And it may be\r\nimagined with what smiles and shrugs, practical and serious\r\ncontemporaries of Redi and of Spallanzani may have commented on the waste\r\nof their high abilities in toiling at the solution of problems which,\r\nthough curious enough in themselves, could be of no conceivable utility\r\nto mankind.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, you will have observed that before we had travelled very\r\nfar upon our road, there appeared, on the right hand and on the left,\r\nfields laden with a harvest of golden grain, immediately convertible into\r\nthose things which the most solidly practical men will admit to have\r\nvalue--viz., money and life.\r\n\r\nThe direct loss to France caused by the Pébrine in seventeen years cannot\r\nbe estimated at less than fifty millions sterling; and if we add to this\r\nwhat Redi's idea, in Pasteur's hands, has done for the wine-grower and\r\nfor the vinegar-maker, and try to capitalise its value, we shall find\r\nthat it will go a long way towards repairing the money losses caused by\r\nthe frightful and calamitous war of this autumn. And as to the equivalent\r\nof Redi's thought in life, how can we over-estimate the value of that\r\nknowledge of the nature of epidemic and epizootic diseases, and\r\nconsequently of the means of checking, or eradicating them, the dawn of\r\nwhich has assuredly commenced?\r\n\r\nLooking back no further than ten years, it is possible to select three\r\n(1863, 1864, and 1869) in which the total number of deaths from scarlet-\r\nfever alone amounted to ninety thousand. That is the return of killed,\r\nthe maimed and disabled being left out of sight. Why, it is to be hoped\r\nthat the list of killed in the present bloodiest of all wars will not\r\namount to more than this! But the facts which I have placed before you\r\nmust leave the least sanguine without a doubt that the nature and the\r\ncauses of this scourge will, one day, be as well understood as those of\r\nthe Pébrine are now; and that the long-suffered massacre of our innocents\r\nwill come to an end.\r\n\r\nAnd thus mankind will have one more admonition that \"the people perish\r\nfor lack of knowledge\"; and that the alleviation of the miseries, and the\r\npromotion of the welfare, of men must be sought, by those who will not\r\nlose their pains, in that diligent, patient, loving study of all the\r\nmultitudinous aspects of Nature, the results of which constitute exact\r\nknowledge, or Science. It is the justification and the glory of this\r\ngreat meeting that it is gathered together for no other object than the\r\nadvancement of the moiety of science which deals with those phenomena of\r\nnature which we call physical. May its endeavours be crowned with a full\r\nmeasure of success!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL CONTEMPORANEITY AND PERSISTENT TYPES OF LIFE\r\n\r\n[1862]\r\n\r\nMerchants occasionally go through a wholesome, though troublesome and not\r\nalways satisfactory, process which they term \"taking stock.\" After all\r\nthe excitement of speculation, the pleasure of gain, and the pain of\r\nloss, the trader makes up his mind to face facts and to learn the exact\r\nquantity and quality of his solid and reliable possessions.\r\n\r\nThe man of science does well sometimes to imitate this procedure; and,\r\nforgetting for the time the importance of his own small winnings, to re-\r\nexamine the common stock in trade, so that he may make sure how far the\r\nstock of bullion in the cellar--on the faith of whose existence so much\r\npaper has been circulating--is really the solid gold of truth.\r\n\r\nThe Anniversary Meeting of the Geological Society seems to be an occasion\r\nwell suited for an undertaking of this kind--for an inquiry, in fact,\r\ninto the nature and value of the present results of palaeontological\r\ninvestigation; and the more so, as all those who have paid close\r\nattention to the late multitudinous discussions in which palaeontology is\r\nimplicated, must have felt the urgent necessity of some such scrutiny.\r\n\r\nFirst in order, as the most definite and unquestionable of all the\r\nresults of palaeontology, must be mentioned the immense extension and\r\nimpulse given to botany, zoology, and comparative anatomy, by the\r\ninvestigation of fossil remains. Indeed, the mass of biological facts has\r\nbeen so greatly increased, and the range of biological speculation has\r\nbeen so vastly widened, by the researches of the geologist and\r\npalaeontologist, that it is to be feared there are naturalists in\r\nexistence who look upon geology as Brindley regarded rivers. \"Rivers,\"\r\nsaid the great engineer, \"were made to feed canals;\" and geology, some\r\nseem to think, was solely created to advance comparative anatomy.\r\n\r\nWere such a thought justifiable, it could hardly expect to be received\r\nwith favour by this assembly. But it is not justifiable. Your favourite\r\nscience has her own great aims independent of all others; and if,\r\nnotwithstanding her steady devotion to her own progress, she can scatter\r\nsuch rich alms among her sisters, it should be remembered that her\r\ncharity is of the sort that does not impoverish, but \"blesseth him that\r\ngives and him that takes.\"\r\n\r\nRegard the matter as we will, however, the facts remain. Nearly 40,000\r\nspecies of animals and plants have been added to the Systema Naturae by\r\npalaeontological research. This is a living population equivalent to that\r\nof a new continent in mere number; equivalent to that of a new\r\nhemisphere, if we take into account the small population of insects as\r\nyet found fossil, and the large proportion and peculiar organisation of\r\nmany of the Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nBut, beyond this, it is perhaps not too much to say that, except for the\r\nnecessity of interpreting palaeontological facts, the laws of distribution\r\nwould have received less careful study; while few comparative anatomists\r\n(and those not of the first order) would have been induced by mere love\r\nof detail, as such, to study the minutiae of osteology, were it not that\r\nin such minutiae lie the only keys to the most interesting riddles offered\r\nby the extinct animal world.\r\n\r\nThese assuredly are great and solid gains. Surely it is matter for no\r\nsmall congratulation that in half a century (for palaeontology, though it\r\ndawned earlier, came into full day only with Cuvier) a subordinate branch\r\nof biology should have doubled the value and the interest of the whole\r\ngroup of sciences to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. Allied with geology, palaeontology has established\r\ntwo laws of inestimable importance: the first, that one and the same area\r\nof the earth's surface has been successively occupied by very different\r\nkinds of living beings; the second, that the order of succession\r\nestablished in one locality holds good, approximately, in all.\r\n\r\nThe first of these laws is universal and irreversible; the second is an\r\ninduction from a vast number of observations, though it may possibly, and\r\neven probably, have to admit of exceptions. As a consequence of the\r\nsecond law, it follows that a peculiar relation frequently subsists\r\nbetween series of strata containing organic remains, in different\r\nlocalities. The series resemble one another not only in virtue of a\r\ngeneral resemblance of the organic remains in the two, but also in virtue\r\nof a resemblance in the order and character of the serial succession in\r\neach. There is a resemblance of arrangement; so that the separate terms\r\nof each series, as well as the whole series, exhibit a correspondence.\r\n\r\nSuccession implies time; the lower members of an undisturbed series of\r\nsedimentary rocks are certainly older than the upper; and when the notion\r\nof age was once introduced as the equivalent of succession, it was no\r\nwonder that correspondence in succession came to be looked upon as a\r\ncorrespondence in age, or \"contemporaneity.\" And, indeed, so long as\r\nrelative age only is spoken of, correspondence in succession _is_\r\ncorrespondence in age; it is _relative_ contemporaneity.\r\n\r\nBut it would have been very much better for geology if so loose and\r\nambiguous a word as \"contemporaneous\" had been excluded from her\r\nterminology, and if, in its stead, some term expressing similarity of\r\nserial relation, and excluding the notion of time altogether, had been\r\nemployed to denote correspondence in position in two or more series of\r\nstrata.\r\n\r\nIn anatomy, where such correspondence of position has constantly to be\r\nspoken of, it is denoted by the word \"homology\" and its derivatives; and\r\nfor Geology (which after all is only the anatomy and physiology of the\r\nearth) it might be well to invent some single word, such as \"homotaxis\"\r\n(similarity of order), in order to express an essentially similar idea.\r\nThis, however, has not been done, and most probably the inquiry will at\r\nonce be made--To what end burden science with a new and strange term in\r\nplace of one old, familiar, and part of our common language?\r\n\r\nThe reply to this question will become obvious as the inquiry into the\r\nresults of palaeontology is pushed further.\r\n\r\nThose whose business it is to acquaint themselves specially with the\r\nworks of palaeontologists, in fact, will be fully aware that very few, if\r\nany, would rest satisfied with such a statement of the conclusions of\r\ntheir branch of biology as that which has just been given.\r\n\r\nOur standard repertories of palaeontology profess to teach us far higher\r\nthings--to disclose the entire succession of living forms upon the\r\nsurface of the globe; to tell us of a wholly different distribution of\r\nclimatic conditions in ancient times; to reveal the character of the\r\nfirst of all living existences; and to trace out the law of progress from\r\nthem to us.\r\n\r\nIt may not be unprofitable to bestow on these professions a somewhat more\r\ncritical examination than they have hitherto received, in order to\r\nascertain how far they rest on an irrefragable basis; or whether, after\r\nall, it might not be well for palaeontologists to learn a little more\r\ncarefully that scientific \"ars artium,\" the art of saying \"I don't know.\"\r\nAnd to this end let us define somewhat more exactly the extent of these\r\npretensions of palaeontology.\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware that Professor Bronn's \"Untersuchungen\" and Professor\r\nPictet's \"Traité de Paléontologie\" are works of standard authority,\r\nfamiliarly consulted by every working palaeontologist. It is desirable to\r\nspeak of these excellent books, and of their distinguished authors, with\r\nthe utmost respect, and in a tone as far as possible removed from carping\r\ncriticism; indeed, if they are specially cited in this place, it is\r\nmerely in justification of the assertion that the following propositions,\r\nwhich may be found implicitly, or explicitly, in the works in question,\r\nare regarded by the mass of palaeontologists and geologists, not only on\r\nthe Continent but in this country, as expressing some of the best-\r\nestablished results of palaeontology. Thus:--\r\n\r\nAnimals and plants began their existence together, not long after the\r\ncommencement of the deposition of the sedimentary rocks; and then\r\nsucceeded one another, in such a manner, that totally distinct faunae and\r\nflorae occupied the whole surface of the earth, one after the other, and\r\nduring distinct epochs of time.\r\n\r\nA geological formation is the sum of all the strata deposited over the\r\nwhole surface of the earth during one of these epochs: a geological fauna\r\nor flora is the sum of all the species of animals or plants which\r\noccupied the whole surface of the globe, during one of these epochs.\r\n\r\nThe population of the earth's surface was at first very similar in all\r\nparts, and only from the middle of the Tertiary epoch onwards, began to\r\nshow a distinct distribution in zones.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of the original population, as well as the numerical\r\nproportions of its members, indicates a warmer and, on the whole,\r\nsomewhat tropical climate, which remained tolerably equable throughout\r\nthe year. The subsequent distribution of living beings in zones is the\r\nresult of a gradual lowering of the general temperature, which first\r\nbegan to be felt at the poles.\r\n\r\nIt is not now proposed to inquire whether these doctrines are true or\r\nfalse; but to direct your attention to a much simpler though very\r\nessential preliminary question--What is their logical basis? what are the\r\nfundamental assumptions upon which they all logically depend? and what is\r\nthe evidence on which those fundamental propositions demand our assent?\r\n\r\nThese assumptions are two: the first, that the commencement of the\r\ngeological record is coëval with the commencement of life on the globe;\r\nthe second, that geological contemporaneity is the same thing as\r\nchronological synchrony. Without the first of these assumptions there\r\nwould of course be no ground for any statement respecting the\r\ncommencement of life; without the second, all the other statements cited,\r\nevery one of which implies a knowledge of the state of different parts of\r\nthe earth at one and the same time, will be no less devoid of\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nThe first assumption obviously rests entirely on negative evidence. This\r\nis, of course, the only evidence that ever can be available to prove the\r\ncommencement of any series of phenomena; but, at the same time, it must\r\nbe recollected that the value of negative evidence depends entirely on\r\nthe amount of positive corroboration it receives. If A.B. wishes to prove\r\nan _alibi_, it is of no use for him to get a thousand witnesses simply to\r\nswear that they did not see him in such and such a place, unless the\r\nwitnesses are prepared to prove that they must have seen him had he been\r\nthere. But the evidence that animal life commenced with the Lingula-\r\nflags, _e.g._, would seem to be exactly of this unsatisfactory\r\nuncorroborated sort. The Cambrian witnesses simply swear they \"haven't\r\nseen anybody their way\"; upon which the counsel for the other side\r\nimmediately puts in ten or twelve thousand feet of Devonian sandstones to\r\nmake oath they never saw a fish or a mollusk, though all the world knows\r\nthere were plenty in their time.\r\n\r\nBut then it is urged that, though the Devonian rocks in one part of the\r\nworld exhibit no fossils, in another they do, while the lower Cambrian\r\nrocks nowhere exhibit fossils, and hence no living being could have\r\nexisted in their epoch.\r\n\r\nTo this there are two replies: the first that the observational basis of\r\nthe assertion that the lowest rocks are nowhere fossiliferous is an\r\namazingly small one, seeing how very small an area, in comparison to that\r\nof the whole world, has yet been fully searched; the second, that the\r\nargument is good for nothing unless the unfossiliferous rocks in question\r\nwere not only _contemporaneous_ in the geological sense, but\r\n_synchronous_ in the chronological sense. To use the _alibi_ illustration\r\nagain. If a man wishes to prove he was in neither of two places, A and B,\r\non a given day, his witnesses for each place must be prepared to answer\r\nfor the whole day. If they can only prove that he was not at A in the\r\nmorning, and not at B in the afternoon, the evidence of his absence from\r\nboth is nil, because he might have been at B in the morning and at A in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nThus everything depends upon the validity of the second assumption. And\r\nwe must proceed to inquire what is the real meaning of the word\r\n\"contemporaneous\" as employed by geologists. To this end a concrete\r\nexample may be taken.\r\n\r\nThe Lias of England and the Lias of Germany, the Cretaceous rocks of\r\nBritain and the Cretaceous rocks of Southern India, are termed by\r\ngeologists \"contemporaneous\" formations; but whenever any thoughtful\r\ngeologist is asked whether he means to say that they were deposited\r\nsynchronously, he says, \"No,--only within the same great epoch.\" And if,\r\nin pursuing the inquiry, he is asked what may be the approximate value in\r\ntime of a \"great epoch\"--whether it means a hundred years, or a thousand,\r\nor a million, or ten million years--his reply is, \"I cannot tell.\"\r\n\r\nIf the further question be put, whether physical geology is in possession\r\nof any method by which the actual synchrony (or the reverse) of any two\r\ndistant deposits can be ascertained, no such method can be heard of; it\r\nbeing admitted by all the best authorities that neither similarity of\r\nmineral composition, nor of physical character, nor even direct\r\ncontinuity of stratum, are _absolute_ proofs of the synchronism of even\r\napproximated sedimentary strata: while, for distant deposits, there seems\r\nto be no kind of physical evidence attainable of a nature competent to\r\ndecide whether such deposits were formed simultaneously, or whether they\r\npossess any given difference of antiquity. To return to an example\r\nalready given: All competent authorities will probably assent to the\r\nproposition that physical geology does not enable us in any way to reply\r\nto this question--Were the British Cretaceous rocks deposited at the same\r\ntime as those of India, or are they a million of years younger or a\r\nmillion of years older?\r\n\r\nIs palaeontology able to succeed where physical geology fails? Standard\r\nwriters on palaeontology, as has been seen, assume that she can. They take\r\nit for granted, that deposits containing similar organic remains are\r\nsynchronous--at any rate in a broad sense; and yet, those who will study\r\nthe eleventh and twelfth chapters of Sir Henry De La Beche's remarkable\r\n\"Researches in Theoretical Geology,\" published now nearly thirty years\r\nago, and will carry out the arguments there most luminously stated, to\r\ntheir logical consequences, may very easily convince themselves that even\r\nabsolute identity of organic contents is no proof of the synchrony of\r\ndeposits, while absolute diversity is no proof of difference of date. Sir\r\nHenry De La Beche goes even further, and adduces conclusive evidence to\r\nshow that the different parts of one and the same stratum, having a\r\nsimilar composition throughout, containing the same organic remains, and\r\nhaving similar beds above and below it, may yet differ to any conceivable\r\nextent in age.\r\n\r\nEdward Forbes was in the habit of asserting that the similarity of the\r\norganic contents of distant formations was _prima facie_ evidence, not of\r\ntheir similarity, but of their difference of age; and holding as he did\r\nthe doctrine of single specific centres, the conclusion was as legitimate\r\nas any other; for the two districts must have been occupied by migration\r\nfrom one of the two, or from an intermediate spot, and the chances\r\nagainst exact coincidence of migration and of imbedding are infinite.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, however, whether the hypothesis of single or of\r\nmultiple specific centres be adopted, similarity of organic contents\r\ncannot possibly afford any proof of the synchrony of the deposits which\r\ncontain them; on the contrary, it is demonstrably compatible with the\r\nlapse of the most prodigious intervals of time, and with the\r\ninterposition of vast changes in the organic and inorganic worlds,\r\nbetween the epochs in which such deposits were formed.\r\n\r\nOn what amount of similarity of their faunae is the doctrine of the\r\ncontemporaneity of the European and of the North American Silurians\r\nbased? In the last edition of Sir Charles Lyell's \"Elementary Geology\" it\r\nis stated, on the authority of a former President of this Society, the\r\nlate Daniel Sharpe, that between 30 and 40 per cent. of the species of\r\nSilurian Mollusca are common to both sides of the Atlantic. By way of due\r\nallowance for further discovery, let us double the lesser number and\r\nsuppose that 60 per cent. of the species are common to the North American\r\nand the British Silurians. Sixty per cent. of species in common is, then,\r\nproof of contemporaneity.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that, a million or two of years hence, when Britain has made\r\nanother dip beneath the sea and has come up again, some geologist applies\r\nthis doctrine, in comparing the strata laid bare by the upheaval of the\r\nbottom, say, of St. George's Channel with what may then remain of the\r\nSuffolk Crag. Reasoning in the same way, he will at once decide the\r\nSuffolk Crag and the St. George's Channel beds to be contemporaneous;\r\nalthough we happen to know that a vast period (even in the geological\r\nsense) of time, and physical changes of almost unprecedented extent,\r\nseparate the two. But if it be a demonstrable fact that strata\r\ncontaining more than 60 or 70 per cent. of species of Mollusca in common,\r\nand comparatively close together, may yet be separated by an amount of\r\ngeological time sufficient to allow of some of the greatest physical\r\nchanges the world has seen, what becomes of that sort of contemporaneity\r\nthe sole evidence of which is a similarity of facies, or the identity of\r\nhalf a dozen species, or of a good many genera?\r\n\r\nAnd yet there is no better evidence for the contemporaneity assumed by\r\nall who adopt the hypothesis of universal faunae and florae, of a\r\nuniversally uniform climate, and of a sensible cooling of the globe\r\nduring geological time.\r\n\r\nThere seems, then, no escape from the admission that neither physical\r\ngeology, nor palaeontology, possesses any method by which the absolute\r\nsynchronism of two strata can be demonstrated. All that geology can prove\r\nis local order of succession. It is mathematically certain that, in any\r\ngiven vertical linear section of an undisturbed series of sedimentary\r\ndeposits, the bed which lies lowest is the oldest. In many other vertical\r\nlinear sections of the same series, of course, corresponding beds will\r\noccur in a similar order; but, however great may be the probability, no\r\nman can say with absolute certainty that the beds in the two sections\r\nwere synchronously deposited. For areas of moderate extent, it is\r\ndoubtless true that no practical evil is likely to result from assuming\r\nthe corresponding beds to be synchronous or strictly contemporaneous; and\r\nthere are multitudes of accessory circumstances which may fully justify\r\nthe assumption of such synchrony. But the moment the geologist has to\r\ndeal with large areas, or with completely separated deposits, the\r\nmischief of confounding that \"homotaxis\" or \"similarity of arrangement,\"\r\nwhich _can_ be demonstrated, with \"synchrony\" or \"identity of date,\" for\r\nwhich there is not a shadow of proof, under the one common term of\r\n\"contemporaneity\" becomes incalculable, and proves the constant source of\r\ngratuitous speculations.\r\n\r\nFor anything that geology or palaeontology are able to show to the\r\ncontrary, a Devonian fauna and flora in the British Islands may have been\r\ncontemporaneous with Silurian life in North America, and with a\r\nCarboniferous fauna and flora in Africa. Geographical provinces and zones\r\nmay have been as distinctly marked in the Palaeozoic epoch as at present,\r\nand those seemingly sudden appearances of new genera and species, which\r\nwe ascribe to new creation, may be simple results of migration.\r\n\r\nIt may be so; it may be otherwise. In the present condition of our\r\nknowledge and of our methods, one verdict--\"not proven, and not\r\nprovable\"--must be recorded against all the grand hypotheses of the\r\npalaeontologist respecting the general succession of life on the globe.\r\nThe order and nature of terrestrial life, as a whole, are open questions.\r\nGeology at present provides us with most valuable topographical records,\r\nbut she has not the means of working them into a universal history. Is\r\nsuch a universal history, then, to be regarded as unattainable? Are all\r\nthe grandest and most interesting problems which offer themselves to the\r\ngeological student, essentially insoluble? Is he in the position of a\r\nscientific Tantalus--doomed always to thirst for a knowledge which he\r\ncannot obtain? The reverse is to be hoped; nay, it may not be impossible\r\nto indicate the source whence help will come.\r\n\r\nIn commencing these remarks, mention was made of the great obligations\r\nunder which the naturalist lies to the geologist and palaeontologist.\r\nAssuredly the time will come when these obligations will be repaid\r\ntenfold, and when the maze of the world's past history, through which the\r\npure geologist and the pure palaeontologist find no guidance, will be\r\nsecurely threaded by the clue furnished by the naturalist.\r\n\r\nAll who are competent to express an opinion on the subject are, at\r\npresent, agreed that the manifold varieties of animal and vegetable form\r\nhave not either come into existence by chance, nor result from capricious\r\nexertions of creative power; but that they have taken place in a definite\r\norder, the statement of which order is what men of science term a natural\r\nlaw. Whether such a law is to be regarded as an expression of the mode of\r\noperation of natural forces, or whether it is simply a statement of the\r\nmanner in which a supernatural power has thought fit to act, is a\r\nsecondary question, so long as the existence of the law and the\r\npossibility of its discovery by the human intellect are granted. But he\r\nmust be a half-hearted philosopher who, believing in that possibility,\r\nand having watched the gigantic strides of the biological sciences during\r\nthe last twenty years, doubts that science will sooner or later make this\r\nfurther step, so as to become possessed of the law of evolution of\r\norganic forms--of the unvarying order of that great chain of causes and\r\neffects of which all organic forms, ancient and modern, are the links.\r\nAnd then, if ever, we shall be able to begin to discuss, with profit, the\r\nquestions respecting the commencement of life, and the nature of the\r\nsuccessive populations of the globe, which so many seem to think are\r\nalready answered.\r\n\r\nThe preceding arguments make no particular claim to novelty; indeed they\r\nhave been floating more or less distinctly before the minds of geologists\r\nfor the last thirty years; and if, at the present time, it has seemed\r\ndesirable to give them more definite and systematic expression, it is\r\nbecause palaeontology is every day assuming a greater importance, and now\r\nrequires to rest on a basis the firmness of which is thoroughly well\r\nassured. Among its fundamental conceptions, there must be no confusion\r\nbetween what is certain and what is more or less probable.[1] But,\r\npending the construction of a surer foundation than palaeontology now\r\npossesses, it may be instructive, assuming for the nonce the general\r\ncorrectness of the ordinary hypothesis of geological contemporaneity, to\r\nconsider whether the deductions which are ordinarily drawn from the whole\r\nbody of palaeontological facts are justifiable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Le plus grand service qu'on puisse rendre à la science est\r\nd'y faire place nette avant d'y rien construire.\"--CUVIER.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence on which such conclusions are based is of two kinds,\r\nnegative and positive. The value of negative evidence, in connection with\r\nthis inquiry, has been so fully and clearly discussed in an address from\r\nthe chair of this Society,[2] which none of us have forgotten, that\r\nnothing need at present be said about it; the more, as the considerations\r\nwhich have been laid before you have certainly not tended to increase\r\nyour estimation of such evidence. It will be preferable to turn to the\r\npositive facts of palaeontology, and to inquire what they tell us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Anniversary Address for 1851, _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._\r\nvol. vii.]\r\n\r\nWe are all accustomed to speak of the number and the extent of the\r\nchanges in the living population of the globe during geological time as\r\nsomething enormous: and indeed they are so, if we regard only the\r\nnegative differences which separate the older rocks from the more modern,\r\nand if we look upon specific and generic changes as great changes, which\r\nfrom one point of view, they truly are. But leaving the negative\r\ndifferences out of consideration, and looking only at the positive data\r\nfurnished by the fossil world from a broader point of view--from that of\r\nthe comparative anatomist who has made the study of the greater\r\nmodifications of animal form his chief business--a surprise of another\r\nkind dawns upon the mind; and under _this_ aspect the smallness of the\r\ntotal change becomes as astonishing as was its greatness under the other.\r\n\r\nThere are two hundred known orders of plants; of these not one is\r\ncertainly known to exist exclusively in the fossil state. The whole lapse\r\nof geological time has as yet yielded not a single new ordinal type of\r\nvegetable structure.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Hooker's _Introductory Essay to the Flora of Tasmania_,\r\np. xxiii.]\r\n\r\nThe positive change in passing from the recent to the ancient animal\r\nworld is greater, but still singularly small. No fossil animal is so\r\ndistinct from those now living as to require to be arranged even in a\r\nseparate class from those which contain existing forms. It is only when\r\nwe come to the orders, which may be roughly estimated at about a hundred\r\nand thirty, that we meet with fossil animals so distinct from those now\r\nliving as to require orders for themselves; and these do not amount, on\r\nthe most liberal estimate, to more than about 10 per cent. of the whole.\r\n\r\nThere is no certainly known extinct order of Protozoa; there is but one\r\namong the Coelenterata--that of the rugose corals; there is none among\r\nthe Mollusca; there are three, the Cystidea, Blastoidea, and\r\nEdrioasterida, among the Echinoderms; and two, the Trilobita and\r\nEurypterida, among the Crustacea; making altogether five for the great\r\nsub-kingdom of Annulosa. Among Vertebrates there is no ordinally distinct\r\nfossil fish: there is only one extinct order of Amphibia--the\r\nLabyrinthodonts; but there are at least four distinct orders of Reptilia,\r\nviz. the Ichthyosauria, Plesiosauria, Pterosauria, Dinosauria, and\r\nperhaps another or two. There is no known extinct order of Birds, and no\r\ncertainly known extinct order of Mammals, the ordinal distinctness of the\r\n\"Toxodontia\" being doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe objection that broad statements of this kind, after all, rest largely\r\non negative evidence is obvious, but it has less force than may at first\r\nbe supposed; for, as might be expected from the circumstances of the\r\ncase, we possess more abundant positive evidence regarding Fishes and\r\nmarine Mollusks than respecting any other forms of animal life; and yet\r\nthese offer us, through the whole range of geological time, no species\r\nordinally distinct from those now living; while the far less numerous\r\nclass of Echinoderms presents three, and the Crustacea two, such orders,\r\nthough none of these come down later than the Palaeozoic age. Lastly, the\r\nReptilia present the extraordinary and exceptional phenomenon of as many\r\nextinct as existing orders, if not more; the four mentioned maintaining\r\ntheir existence from the Lias to the Chalk inclusive.\r\n\r\nSome years ago one of your Secretaries pointed out another kind of\r\npositive palaeontological evidence tending towards the same conclusion--\r\nafforded by the existence of what he termed \"persistent types\" of\r\nvegetable and of animal life.[4] He stated, on the authority of Dr.\r\nHooker, that there are Carboniferous plants which appear to be\r\ngenerically identical with some now living; that the cone of the Oolitic\r\n_Araucaria_ is hardly distinguishable from that of an existing species;\r\nthat a true _Pinus_ appears in the Purbecks and a _Juglans_ in the Chalk;\r\nwhile, from the Bagshot Sands, a _Banksia_, the wood of which is not\r\ndistinguishable from that of species now living in Australia, had been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See the abstract of a Lecture \"On the Persistent Types of\r\nAnimal Life,\" in the _Notices of the Meetings of the Royal Institution of\r\nGreat Britain_.--June 3, 1859, vol. iii. p. 151.]\r\n\r\nTurning to the animal kingdom, he affirmed the tabulate corals of the\r\nSilurian rocks to be wonderfully like those which now exist; while even\r\nthe families of the Aporosa were all represented in the older Mesozoic\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nAmong the Mollusca similar facts were adduced. Let it be borne in mind\r\nthat _Avicula, Mytilus, Chiton, Natica, Patella, Trochus, Discina,\r\nOrbicula, Lingula, Rhynchonclla_, and _Nautilus_, all of which are\r\nexisting _genera_, are given without a doubt as Silurian in the last\r\nedition of \"Siluria\"; while the highest forms of the highest Cephalopods\r\nare represented in the Lias by a genus _Belemnoteuthis_, which presents\r\nthe closest relation to the existing _Loligo_.\r\n\r\nThe two highest groups of the Annulosa, the Insecta and the Arachnida,\r\nare represented in the Coal, either by existing genera, or by forms\r\ndiffering from existing genera in quite minor peculiarities.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Vertebrata, the only palaeozoic Elasmobranch Fish of which\r\nwe have any complete knowledge is the Devonian and Carboniferous\r\n_Pleuracanthus_, which differs no more from existing Sharks than these do\r\nfrom one another.\r\n\r\nAgain, vast as is the number of undoubtedly Ganoid fossil Fishes, and\r\ngreat as is their range in time, a large mass of evidence has recently\r\nbeen adduced to show that almost all those respecting which we possess\r\nsufficient information, are referable to the same sub-ordinal groups as\r\nthe existing _Lepidosteus, Polypterus_, and Sturgeon; and that a singular\r\nrelation obtains between the older and the younger Fishes; the former,\r\nthe Devonian Ganoids, being almost all members of the same sub-order as\r\n_Polypterus_, while the Mesozoic Ganoids are almost all similarly allied\r\nto _Lepidosteus_.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: \"Memoirs of the Geological Survey of the United Kingdom.--\r\nDecade x. Preliminary Essay upon the Systematic Arrangement of the Fishes\r\nof the Devonian Epoch.\"]\r\n\r\nAgain, what can be more remarkable than the singular constancy of\r\nstructure preserved throughout a vast period of time by the family of the\r\nPycnodonts and by that of the true Coelacanths; the former persisting,\r\nwith but insignificant modifications, from the Carboniferous to the\r\nTertiary rocks, inclusive; the latter existing, with still less change,\r\nfrom the Carboniferous rocks to the Chalk, inclusive?\r\n\r\nAmong Reptiles, the highest living group, that of the Crocodilia, is\r\nrepresented, at the early part of the Mesozoic epoch, by species\r\nidentical in the essential characters of their organisation with those\r\nnow living, and differing from the latter only in such matters as the\r\nform of the articular facets of the vertebral centra, in the extent to\r\nwhich the nasal passages are separated from the cavity of the mouth by\r\nbone, and in the proportions of the limbs.\r\n\r\nAnd even as regards the Mammalia, the scanty remains of Triassic and\r\nOolitic species afford no foundation for the supposition that the\r\norganisation of the oldest forms differed nearly so much from some of\r\nthose which now live as these differ from one another.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to multiply these instances; enough has been said to\r\njustify the statement that, in view of the immense diversity of known\r\nanimal and vegetable forms, and the enormous lapse of time indicated by\r\nthe accumulation of fossiliferous strata, the only circumstance to be\r\nwondered at is, not that the changes of life, as exhibited by positive\r\nevidence, have been so great but that they have been so small.\r\n\r\nBe they great or small, however, it is desirable to attempt to estimate\r\nthem. Let us, therefore, take each great division of the animal world in\r\nsuccession, and, whenever an order or a family can be shown to have had a\r\nprolonged existence, let us endeavour to ascertain how far the later\r\nmembers of the group differ from the earlier ones. If these later\r\nmembers, in all or in many cases, exhibit a certain amount of\r\nmodification, the fact is, so far, evidence in favour of a general law of\r\nchange; and, in a rough way, the rapidity of that change will be measured\r\nby the demonstrable amount of modification. On the other hand, it must be\r\nrecollected that the absence of any modification, while it may leave the\r\ndoctrine of the existence of a law of change without positive support,\r\ncannot possibly disprove all forms of that doctrine, though it may afford\r\na sufficient refutation of many of them.\r\n\r\nThe PROTOZOA.--The Protozoa are represented throughout the whole range of\r\ngeological series, from the Lower Silurian formation to the present day.\r\nThe most ancient forms recently made known by Ehrenberg are exceedingly\r\nlike those which now exist: no one has ever pretended that the difference\r\nbetween any ancient and any modern Foraminifera is of more than generic\r\nvalue, nor are the oldest Foraminifera either simpler, more embryonic, or\r\nless differentiated, than the existing forms.\r\n\r\nThe COELENTERATA.--The Tabulate Corals have existed from the Silurian\r\nepoch to the present day, but I am not aware that the ancient\r\n_Heliolites_ possesses a single mark of a more embryonic or less\r\ndifferentiated character, or less high organisation, than the existing\r\n_Heliopora_. As for the Aporose Corals, in what respect is the Silurian\r\n_Paloeocyclus_ less highly organised or more embryonic than the modern\r\n_Fungia_, or the Liassic Aporosa than the existing members of the same\r\nfamilies?\r\n\r\nThe _Mollusca_--In what sense is the living _Waldheimia_ less embryonic,\r\nor more specialised, than the palaeozoic _Spirifer_; or the existing\r\n_Rhynchonelloe, Cranioe, Discinoe, Linguloe_, than the Silurian species\r\nof the same genera? In what sense can _Loligo_ or _Spirula_ be said to be\r\nmore specialised, or less embryonic, than _Belemnites_; or the modern\r\nspecies of Lamellibranch and Gasteropod genera, than the Silurian species\r\nof the same genera?\r\n\r\nThe ANNULOSA.--The Carboniferous Insecta and Arachnida are neither less\r\nspecialised, nor more embryonic, than these that now live, nor are the\r\nLiassic Cirripedia and Macrura; while several of the Brachyura, which\r\nappear in the Chalk, belong to existing genera; and none exhibit either\r\nan intermediate, or an embryonic, character.\r\n\r\nThe VERTEBRATA.--Among fishes I have referred to the Coelacanthini\r\n(comprising the genera _Coelacanthus, Holophagus, Undina_, and\r\n_Macropoma_) as affording an example of a persistent type; and it is most\r\nremarkable to note the smallness of the differences between any of these\r\nfishes (affecting at most the proportions of the body and fins, and the\r\ncharacter and sculpture of the scales), notwithstanding their enormous\r\nrange in time. In all the essentials of its very peculiar structure, the\r\n_Macropoma_ of the Chalk is identical with the _Coelacanthus_ of the\r\nCoal. Look at the genus _Lepidotus_, again, persisting without a\r\nmodification of importance from the Liassic to the Eocene formations\r\ninclusively.\r\n\r\nOr among the Teleostei--in what respect is the _Beryx_ of the Chalk more\r\nembryonic, or less differentiated, than _Beryx lineatus_ of King George's\r\nSound?\r\n\r\nOr to turn to the higher Vertebrata--in what sense are the Liassic\r\nChelonia inferior to those which now exist? How are the Cretaceous\r\nIchthyosauria, Plesiosauria, or Pterosauria less embryonic, or more\r\ndifferentiated, species than those of the Lias?\r\n\r\nOr lastly, in what circumstance is the _Phascolotherium_ more embryonic,\r\nor of a more generalised type, than the modern Opossum; or a _Lophiodon_,\r\nor a _Paloeotherium_, than a modern _Tapirus_ or _Hyrax_?\r\n\r\nThese examples might be almost indefinitely multiplied, but surely they\r\nare sufficient to prove that the only safe and unquestionable testimony\r\nwe can procure--positive evidence--fails to demonstrate any sort of\r\nprogressive modification towards a less embryonic, or less generalised,\r\ntype in a great many groups of animals of long-continued geological\r\nexistence. In these groups there is abundant evidence of variation--none\r\nof what is ordinarily understood as progression; and, if the known\r\ngeological record is to be regarded as even any considerable fragment of\r\nthe whole, it is inconceivable that any theory of a necessarily\r\nprogressive development can stand, for the numerous orders and families\r\ncited afford no trace of such a process.\r\n\r\nBut it is a most remarkable fact, that, while the groups which have been\r\nmentioned, and many besides, exhibit no sign of progressive modification,\r\nthere are others, co-existing with them, under the same conditions, in\r\nwhich more or less distinct indications of such a process seems to be\r\ntraceable. Among such indications I may remind you of the predominance of\r\nHolostome Gasteropoda in the older rocks as compared with that of\r\nSiphonostone Gasteropoda in the later. A case less open to the objection\r\nof negative evidence, however, is that afforded by the Tetrabranchiate\r\nCephalopoda, the forms of the shells and of the septal sutures exhibiting\r\na certain increase of complexity in the newer genera. Here, however, one\r\nis met at once with the occurrence of _Orthoceras_ and _Baculites_ at the\r\ntwo ends of the series, and of the fact that one of the simplest genera,\r\n_Nautilus_, is that which now exists.\r\n\r\nThe Crinoidea, in the abundance of stalked forms in the ancient\r\nformations as compared with their present rarity, seem to present us with\r\na fair case of modification from a more embryonic towards a less\r\nembryonic condition. But then, on careful consideration of the facts, the\r\nobjection arises that the stalk, calyx, and arms of the palaeozoic Crinoid\r\nare exceedingly different from the corresponding organs of a larval\r\n_Comatula_; and it might with perfect justice be argued that\r\n_Actinocrinus_ and _Eucalyptocrinus_, for example, depart to the full as\r\nwidely, in one direction, from the stalked embryo of _Comatula_, as\r\n_Comatula_ itself does in the other.\r\n\r\nThe Echinidea, again, are frequently quoted as exhibiting a gradual\r\npassage from a more generalised to a more specialised type, seeing that\r\nthe elongated, or oval, Spatangoids appear after the spheroidal\r\nEchinoids. But here it might be argued, on the other hand, that the\r\nspheroidal Echinoids, in reality, depart further from the general plan\r\nand from the embryonic form than the elongated Spatangoids do; and that\r\nthe peculiar dental apparatus and the pedicellariae of the former are\r\nmarks of at least as great differentiation as the petaloid ambulacra and\r\nsemitae of the latter.\r\n\r\nOnce more, the prevalence of Macrurous before Brachyurous Podophthalmia\r\nis, apparently, a fair piece of evidence in favour of progressive\r\nmodification in the same order of Crustacea; and yet the case will not\r\nstand much sifting, seeing that the Macrurous Podophthalmia depart as far\r\nin one direction from the common type of Podophthalmia, or from any\r\nembryonic condition of the Brachyura, as the Brachyura do in the other;\r\nand that the middle terms between Macrura and Brachyura--the Anomura--are\r\nlittle better represented in the older Mesozoic rocks than the Brachyura\r\nare.\r\n\r\nNone of the cases of progressive modification which are cited from among\r\nthe Invertebrata appear to me to have a foundation less open to criticism\r\nthan these; and if this be so, no careful reasoner would, I think, be\r\ninclined to lay very great stress upon them. Among the Vertebrata,\r\nhowever, there are a few examples which appear to be far less open to\r\nobjection.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, true of several groups of Vertebrata which have lived\r\nthrough a considerable range of time, that the endoskeleton (more\r\nparticularly the spinal column) of the older genera presents a less\r\nossified, and, so far, less differentiated, condition than that of the\r\nyounger genera. Thus the Devonian Ganoids, though almost all members of\r\nthe same sub-order as _Polypterus_, and presenting numerous important\r\nresemblances to the existing genus, which possesses biconclave vertebrae,\r\nare, for the most part, wholly devoid of ossified vertebral centra. The\r\nMesozoic Lepidosteidae, again, have, at most, biconcave vertebrae, while\r\nthe existing _Lepidosteus_ has Salamandroid, opisthocoelous, vertebrae.\r\nSo, none of the Palaeozoic Sharks have shown themselves to be possessed of\r\nossified vertebrae, while the majority of modern Sharks possess such\r\nvertebrae. Again, the more ancient Crocodilia and Lacertilia have vertebrae\r\nwith the articular facets of their centra flattened or biconcave, while\r\nthe modern members of the same group have them procoelous. But the most\r\nremarkable examples of progressive modification of the vertebral column,\r\nin correspondence with geological age, are those afforded by the\r\nPycnodonts among fish, and the Labyrinthodonts among Amphibia.\r\n\r\nThe late able ichthyologist Heckel pointed out the fact, that, while the\r\nPycnodonts never possess true vertebral centra, they differ in the degree\r\nof expansion and extension of the ends of the bony arches of the vertebrae\r\nupon the sheath of the notochord; the Carboniferous forms exhibiting\r\nhardly any such expansion, while the Mesozoic genera present a greater\r\nand greater development, until, in the Tertiary forms, the expanded ends\r\nbecome suturally united so as to form a sort of false vertebra. Hermann\r\nvon Meyer, again, to whose luminous researches we are indebted for our\r\npresent large knowledge of the organisation of the older Labyrinthodonts,\r\nhas proved that the Carboniferous _Archegosaurus_ had very imperfectly\r\ndeveloped vertebral centra, while the Triassic _Mastodonsaurus_ had the\r\nsame parts completely ossified.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: As this Address is passing through the press (March 7,\r\n1862), evidence lies before me of the existence of a new Labyrinthodont\r\n(_Pholidogaster_), from the Edinburgh coal-field with well-ossified\r\nvertebral centra.]\r\n\r\nThe regularity and evenness of the dentition of the _Anoplotherium_, as\r\ncontrasted with that of existing Artiodactyles, and the assumed nearer\r\napproach of the dentition of certain ancient Carnivores to the typical\r\narrangement, have also been cited as exemplifications of a law of\r\nprogressive development, but I know of no other cases based on positive\r\nevidence which are worthy of particular notice.\r\n\r\nWhat then does an impartial survey of the positively ascertained truths\r\nof palaeontology testify in relation to the common doctrines of\r\nprogressive modification, which suppose that modification to have taken\r\nplace by a necessary progress from more to less embryonic forms, or from\r\nmore to less generalised types, within the limits of the period\r\nrepresented by the fossiliferous rocks?\r\n\r\nIt negatives those doctrines; for it either shows us no evidence of any\r\nsuch modification, or demonstrates it to have been very slight; and as to\r\nthe nature of that modification, it yields no evidence whatsoever that\r\nthe earlier members of any long-continued group were more generalised in\r\nstructure than the later ones. To a certain extent, indeed, it may be\r\nsaid that imperfect ossification of the vertebral column is an embryonic\r\ncharacter; but, on the other hand, it would be extremely incorrect to\r\nsuppose that the vertebral columns of the older Vertebrata are in any\r\nsense embryonic in their whole structure.\r\n\r\nObviously, if the earliest fossiliferous rocks now known are coëval with\r\nthe commencement of life, and if their contents give us any just\r\nconception of the nature and the extent of the earliest fauna and flora,\r\nthe insignificant amount of modification which can be demonstrated to\r\nhave taken place in any one group of animals, or plants, is quite\r\nincompatible with the hypothesis that all living forms are the results of\r\na necessary process of progressive development, entirely comprised within\r\nthe time represented by the fossiliferous rocks.\r\n\r\nContrariwise, any admissible hypothesis of progressive modification must\r\nbe compatible with persistence without progression, through indefinite\r\nperiods. And should such an hypothesis eventually be proved to be true,\r\nin the only way in which it can be demonstrated, viz. by observation and\r\nexperiment upon the existing forms of life, the conclusion will\r\ninevitably present itself, that the Palaeozoic Mesozoic, and Cainozoic\r\nfaunae and florae, taken together, bear somewhat the same proportion to the\r\nwhole series of living beings which have occupied this globe, as the\r\nexisting fauna and flora do to them.\r\n\r\nSuch are the results of palaeontology as they appear, and have for some\r\nyears appeared, to the mind of an inquirer who regards that study simply\r\nas one of the applications of the great biological sciences, and who\r\ndesires to see it placed upon the same sound basis as other branches of\r\nphysical inquiry. If the arguments which have been brought forward are\r\nvalid, probably no one, in view of the present state of opinion, will be\r\ninclined to think the time wasted which has been spent upon their\r\nelaboration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL REFORM\r\n\r\n[1869]\r\n\r\n\"A great reform in geological speculation seems now to have become\r\nnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite certain that a great mistake has been made--that British\r\npopular geology at the present time is in direct opposition to the\r\nprinciples of Natural Philosophy.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On Geological Time. By Sir W. Thomson, LL.D. _Transactions\r\nof the Geological Society of Glasgow_, vol. iii.]\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the course of geological thought during the past year, for\r\nthe purpose of discovering those matters to which I might most fitly\r\ndirect your attention in the Address which it now becomes my duty to\r\ndeliver from the Presidential Chair, the two somewhat alarming sentences\r\nwhich I have just read, and which occur in an able and interesting essay\r\nby an eminent natural philosopher, rose into such prominence before my\r\nmind that they eclipsed everything else.\r\n\r\nIt surely is a matter of paramount importance for the British geologists\r\n(some of them very popular geologists too) here in solemn annual session\r\nassembled, to inquire whether the severe judgment thus passed upon them\r\nby so high an authority as Sir William Thomson is one to which they must\r\nplead guilty _sans phrase_, or whether they are prepared to say \"not\r\nguilty,\" and appeal for a reversal of the sentence to that higher court\r\nof educated scientific opinion to which we are all amenable.\r\n\r\nAs your attorney-general for the time being, I thought I could not do\r\nbetter than get up the case with a view of advising you. It is true that\r\nthe charges brought forward by the other side involve the consideration\r\nof matters quite foreign to the pursuits with which I am ordinarily\r\noccupied; but, in that respect, I am only in the position which is, nine\r\ntimes out of ten, occupied by counsel, who nevertheless contrive to gain\r\ntheir causes, mainly by force of mother-wit and common-sense, aided by\r\nsome training in other intellectual exercises.\r\n\r\nNerved by such precedents, I proceed to put my pleading before you.\r\n\r\nAnd the first question with which I propose to deal is, What is it to\r\nwhich Sir W. Thomson refers when he speaks of \"geological speculation\"\r\nand \"British popular geology\"?\r\n\r\nI find three, more or less contradictory, systems of geological thought,\r\neach of which might fairly enough claim these appellations, standing side\r\nby side in Britain. I shall call one of them CATASTROPHISM, another\r\nUNIFORMITARIANISM, the third EVOLUTIONISM; and I shall try briefly to\r\nsketch the characters of each, that you may say whether the\r\nclassification is, or is not, exhaustive.\r\n\r\nBy CATASTROPHISM, I mean any form of geological speculation which, in\r\norder to account for the phenomena of geology, supposes the operation of\r\nforces different in their nature, or immeasurably different in power,\r\nfrom those which we at present see in action in the universe.\r\n\r\nThe Mosaic cosmogony is, in this sense, catastrophic, because it assumes\r\nthe operation of extra-natural power. The doctrine of violent upheavals,\r\n_débâcles_, and cataclysms in general, is catastrophic, so far as it\r\nassumes that these were brought about by causes which have now no\r\nparallel. There was a time when catastrophism might, pre-eminently, have\r\nclaimed the title of \"British popular geology\"; and assuredly it has yet\r\nmany adherents, and reckons among its supporters some of the most\r\nhonoured members of this Society.\r\n\r\nBy UNIFORMITARIANISM, I mean especially, the teaching of Hutton and of\r\nLyell.\r\n\r\nThat great though incomplete work, \"The Theory of the Earth,\" seems to me\r\nto be one of the most remarkable contributions to geology which is\r\nrecorded in the annals of the science. So far as the not-living world is\r\nconcerned, uniformitarianism lies there, not only in germ, but in blossom\r\nand fruit.\r\n\r\nIf one asks how it is that Hutton was led to entertain views so far in\r\nadvance of those prevalent in his time, in some respects; while, in\r\nothers, they seem almost curiously limited, the answer appears to me to\r\nbe plain.\r\n\r\nHutton was in advance of the geological speculation of his time, because,\r\nin the first place, he had amassed a vast store of knowledge of the facts\r\nof geology, gathered by personal observation in travels of considerable\r\nextent; and because, in the second place, he was thoroughly trained in\r\nthe physical and chemical science of his day, and thus possessed, as much\r\nas any one in his time could possess it, the knowledge which is requisite\r\nfor the just interpretation of geological phenomena, and the habit of\r\nthought which fits a man for scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is to this thorough scientific training that I ascribe Hutton's steady\r\nand persistent refusal to look to other causes than those now in\r\noperation, for the explanation of geological phenomena.\r\n\r\nThus he writes:--\"I do not pretend, as he [M. de Luc] does in his theory,\r\nto describe the beginning of things. I take things such as I find them at\r\npresent; and from these I reason with regard to that which must have\r\nbeen.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _The Theory of the Earth_, vol. i. p. 173, note.]\r\n\r\nAnd again:--\"A theory of the earth, which has for object truth, can have\r\nno retrospect to that which had preceded the present order of the world;\r\nfor this order alone is what we have to reason upon; and to reason\r\nwithout data is nothing but delusion. A theory, therefore, which is\r\nlimited to the actual constitution of this earth cannot be allowed to\r\nproceed one step beyond the present order of things.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid._, vol. i. p. 281.]\r\n\r\nAnd so clear is he, that no causes beside such as are now in operation\r\nare needed to account for the character and disposition of the components\r\nof the crust of the earth, that he says, broadly and boldly:--\" ... There\r\nis no part of the earth which has not had the same origin, so far as this\r\nconsists in that earth being collected at the bottom of the sea, and\r\nafterwards produced, as land, along with masses of melted substances, by\r\nthe operation of mineral causes.\"[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ibid._. p. 371.]\r\n\r\nBut other influences were at work upon Hutton beside those of a mind\r\nlogical by nature, and scientific by sound training; and the peculiar\r\nturn which his speculations took seems to me to be unintelligible, unless\r\nthese be taken into account. The arguments of the French astronomers and\r\nmathematicians, which, at the end of the last century, were held to\r\ndemonstrate the existence of a compensating arrangement among the\r\ncelestial bodies, whereby all perturbations eventually reduced themselves\r\nto oscillations on each side of a mean position, and the stability of the\r\nsolar system was secured, had evidently taken strong hold of Hutton's\r\nmind.\r\n\r\nIn those oddly constructed periods which seem to have prejudiced many\r\npersons against reading his works, but which are full of that peculiar,\r\nif unattractive, eloquence which flows from mastery of the subject,\r\nHutton says:--\r\n\r\n\"We have now got to the end of our reasoning; we have no data further to\r\nconclude immediately from that which actually is. But we have got enough;\r\nwe have the satisfaction to find, that in Nature there is wisdom, system,\r\nand consistency. For having, in the natural history of this earth, seen a\r\nsuccession of worlds, we may from this conclude that there is a system in\r\nNature; in like manner as, from seeing revolutions of the planets, it is\r\nconcluded, that there is a system by which they are intended to continue\r\nthose revolutions. But if the succession of worlds is established in the\r\nsystem of nature, it is in vain to look for anything higher in the origin\r\nof the earth. The result, therefore, of this physical inquiry is, that we\r\nfind no vestige of a beginning,--no prospect of an end.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Ibid._, vol. i. p. 200.]\r\n\r\nYet another influence worked strongly upon Hutton. Like most philosophers\r\nof his age, he coquetted with those final causes which have been named\r\nbarren virgins, but which might be more fitly termed the _hetairoe_ of\r\nphilosophy, so constantly have they led men astray. The final cause of\r\nthe existence of the world is, for Hutton, the production of life and\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n\"We have now considered the globe of this earth as a machine, constructed\r\nupon chemical as well as mechanical principles, by which its different\r\nparts are all adapted, in form, in quality, and in quantity, to a certain\r\nend; an end attained with certainty or success; and an end from which we\r\nmay perceive wisdom, in contemplating the means employed.\r\n\r\n\"But is this world to be considered thus merely as a machine, to last no\r\nlonger than its parts retain their present position, their proper forms\r\nand qualities? Or may it not be also considered as an organised body?\r\nsuch as has a constitution in which the necessary decay of the machine is\r\nnaturally repaired, in the exertion of those productive powers by which\r\nit had been formed.\r\n\r\n\"This is the view in which we are now to examine the globe; to see if\r\nthere be, in the constitution of this world, a reproductive operation, by\r\nwhich a ruined constitution may be again repaired, and a duration or\r\nstability thus procured to the machine, considered as a world sustaining\r\nplants and animals.\"[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Ibid._, vol. i. pp. 16, 17.]\r\n\r\nKirwan, and the other Philistines of the day, accused Hutton of declaring\r\nthat his theory implied that the world never had a beginning, and never\r\ndiffered in condition from its present state. Nothing could be more\r\ngrossly unjust, as he expressly guards himself against any such\r\nconclusion in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n\"But in thus tracing back the natural operations which have succeeded\r\neach other, and mark to us the course of time past, we come to a period\r\nin which we cannot see any farther. This, however, is not the beginning\r\nof the operations which proceed in time and according to the wise economy\r\nof this world; nor is it the establishing of that which, in the course of\r\ntime, had no beginning; it is only the limit of our retrospective view of\r\nthose operations which have come to pass in time, and have been conducted\r\nby supreme intelligence.\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Ibid._, vol. i. p. 223.]\r\n\r\nI have spoken of Uniformitarianism as the doctrine of Hutton and of\r\nLyell. If I have quoted the older writer rather than the newer, it is\r\nbecause his works are little known, and his claims on our veneration too\r\nfrequently forgotten, not because I desire to dim the fame of his eminent\r\nsuccessor. Few of the present generation of geologists have read\r\nPlayfair's \"Illustrations,\" fewer still the original \"Theory of the\r\nEarth\"; the more is the pity; but which of us has not thumbed every page\r\nof the \"Principles of Geology\"? I think that he who writes fairly the\r\nhistory of his own progress in geological thought, will not be able to\r\nseparate his debt to Hutton from his obligations to Lyell; and the\r\nhistory of the progress of individual geologists is the history of\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one can doubt that the influence of uniformitarian views has been\r\nenormous, and, in the main, most beneficial and favourable to the\r\nprogress of sound geology.\r\n\r\nNor can it be questioned that Uniformitarianism has even a stronger title\r\nthan Catastrophism to call itself the geological speculation of Britain,\r\nor, if you will, British popular geology. For it is eminently a British\r\ndoctrine, and has even now made comparatively little progress on the\r\ncontinent of Europe. Nevertheless, it seems to me to be open to serious\r\ncriticism upon one of its aspects.\r\n\r\nI have shown how unjust was the insinuation that Hutton denied a\r\nbeginning to the world. But it would not be unjust to say that he\r\npersistently in practice, shut his eyes to the existence of that prior\r\nand different state of things which, in theory, he admitted; and, in this\r\naversion to look beyond the veil of stratified rocks, Lyell follows him.\r\n\r\nHutton and Lyell alike agree in their indisposition to carry their\r\nspeculations a step beyond the period recorded in the most ancient strata\r\nnow open to observation in the crust of the earth. This is, for Hutton,\r\n\"the point in which we cannot see any farther\"; while Lyell tells us,--\r\n\r\n\"The astronomer may find good reasons for ascribing the earth's form to\r\nthe original fluidity of the mass, in times long antecedent to the first\r\nintroduction of living beings into the planet; but the geologist must be\r\ncontent to regard the earliest monuments which it is his task to\r\ninterpret, as belonging to a period when the crust had already acquired\r\ngreat solidity and thickness, probably as great as it now possesses, and\r\nwhen volcanic rocks, not essentially differing from those now produced,\r\nwere formed from time to time, the intensity of volcanic heat being\r\nneither greater nor less than it is now.\"[8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: _Principles of Geology_, vol. ii. p. 211.]\r\n\r\nAnd again, \"As geologists, we learn that it is not only the present\r\ncondition of the globe which has been suited to the accommodation of\r\nmyriads of living creatures, but that many former states also have been\r\nadapted to the organisation and habits of prior races of beings. The\r\ndisposition of the seas, continents and islands, and the climates, have\r\nvaried; the species likewise have been changed; and yet they have all\r\nbeen so modelled, on types analogous to those of existing plants and\r\nanimals, as to indicate, throughout, a perfect harmony of design and\r\nunity of purpose. To assume that the evidence of the beginning, or end,\r\nof so vast a scheme lies within the reach of our philosophical inquiries,\r\nor even of our speculations, appears to be inconsistent with a just\r\nestimate of the relations which subsist between the finite powers of man\r\nand the attributes of an infinite and eternal Being.\"[9]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Ibid._, vol. ii. p. 613.]\r\n\r\nThe limitations implied in these passages appear to me to constitute the\r\nweakness and the logical defect of Uniformitarianism. No one will impute\r\nblame to Hutton that, in face of the imperfect condition, in his day, of\r\nthose physical sciences which furnish the keys to the riddles of geology,\r\nhe should have thought it practical wisdom to limit his theory to an\r\nattempt to account for \"the present order of things\"; but I am at a loss\r\nto comprehend why, for all time, the geologist must be content to regard\r\nthe oldest fossiliferous rocks as the _ultima Thule_ of his science; or\r\nwhat there is inconsistent with the relations between the finite and the\r\ninfinite mind, in the assumption, that we may discern somewhat of the\r\nbeginning, or of the end, of this speck in space we call our earth. The\r\nfinite mind is certainly competent to trace out the development of the\r\nfowl within the egg; and I know not on what ground it should find more\r\ndifficulty in unravelling the complexities Of the development of the\r\nearth. In fact, as Kant has well remarked,[10] the cosmical process is\r\nreally simpler than the biological.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: \"Man darf es sich also nicht befremden lassen, wenn ich\r\nmich unterstehe zu sagen, dass eher die Bildung aller Himmelskörper, die\r\nUrsache ihrer Bewegungen, kurz der Ursprung der gantzen gegenwärtigen\r\nVerfassung des Weltbaues werden können eingesehen werden, ehe die\r\nErzeugung eines einzigen Krautes oder einer Raupe aus mechanischen\r\nGründen, deutlich und vollständig kund werden wird.\"--KANT'S _Sämmtliche\r\nWerke_, Bd. i. p. 220.]\r\n\r\nThis attempt to limit, at a particular point, the progress of inductive\r\nand deductive reasoning from the things which are, to those which were--\r\nthis faithlessness to its own logic, seems to me to have cost\r\nUniformitarianism the place, as the permanent form of geological\r\nspeculation, which it might otherwise have held.\r\n\r\nIt remains that I should put before you what I understand to be the third\r\nphase of geological speculation--namely, EVOLUTIONISM.\r\n\r\nI shall not make what I have to say on this head clear, unless I diverge,\r\nor seem to diverge, for a while, from the direct path of my discourse, so\r\nfar as to explain what I take to be the scope of geology itself. I\r\nconceive geology to be the history of the earth, in precisely the same\r\nsense as biology is the history of living beings; and I trust you will\r\nnot think that I am overpowered by the influence of a dominant pursuit if\r\nI say that I trace a close analogy between these two histories.\r\n\r\nIf I study a living being, under what heads does the knowledge I obtain\r\nfall? I can learn its structure, or what we call its ANATOMY; and its\r\nDEVELOPMENT, or the series of changes which it passes through to acquire\r\nits complete structure. Then I find that the living being has certain\r\npowers resulting from its own activities, and the interaction of these\r\nwith the activities of other things--the knowledge of which is\r\nPHYSIOLOGY. Beyond this the living being has a position in space and\r\ntime, which is its DISTRIBUTION. All these form the body of ascertainable\r\nfacts which constitute the _status quo_ of the living creature. But these\r\nfacts have their causes; and the ascertainment of these causes is the\r\ndoctrine of AETIOLOGY.\r\n\r\nIf we consider what is knowable about the earth, we shall find that such\r\nearth-knowledge--if I may so translate the word geology--falls into the\r\nsame categories.\r\n\r\nWhat is termed stratigraphical geology is neither more nor less than the\r\nanatomy of the earth; and the history of the succession of the formations\r\nis the history of a succession of such anatomies, or corresponds with\r\ndevelopment, as distinct from generation.\r\n\r\nThe internal heat of the earth, the elevation and depression of its\r\ncrust, its belchings forth of vapours, ashes, and lava, are its\r\nactivities, in as strict a sense as are warmth and the movements and\r\nproducts of respiration the activities of an animal. The phenomena of the\r\nseasons, of the trade winds, of the Gulf-stream, are as much the results\r\nof the reaction between these inner activities and outward forces, as are\r\nthe budding of the leaves in spring and their falling in autumn the\r\neffects of the interaction between the organisation of a plant and the\r\nsolar light and heat. And, as the study of the activities of the living\r\nbeing is called its physiology, so are these phenomena the subject-matter\r\nof an analogous telluric physiology, to which we sometimes give the name\r\nof meteorology, sometimes that of physical geography, sometimes that of\r\ngeology. Again, the earth has a place in space and in time, and relations\r\nto other bodies in both these respects, which constitute its\r\ndistribution. This subject is usually left to the astronomer; but a\r\nknowledge of its broad outlines seems to me to be an essential\r\nconstituent of the stock of geological ideas.\r\n\r\nAll that can be ascertained concerning the structure, succession of\r\nconditions, actions, and position in space of the earth, is the matter of\r\nfact of its natural history. But, as in biology, there remains the matter\r\nof reasoning from these facts to their causes, which is just as much\r\nscience as the other, and indeed more; and this constitutes geological\r\naetiology.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to this general scheme of geological knowledge and thought,\r\nit is obvious that geological speculation may be, so to speak, anatomical\r\nand developmental speculation, so far as it relates to points of\r\nstratigraphical arrangement which are out of reach of direct observation;\r\nor, it may be physiological speculation so far as it relates to\r\nundetermined problems relative to the activities of the earth; or, it may\r\nbe distributional speculation, if it deals with modifications of the\r\nearth's place in space; or, finally, it will be aetiological speculation\r\nif it attempts to deduce the history of the world, as a whole, from the\r\nknown properties of the matter of the earth, in the conditions in which\r\nthe earth has been placed.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the present discourse I may take this last to be what\r\nis meant by \"geological speculation.\"\r\n\r\nNow Uniformitarianism, as we have seen, tends to ignore geological\r\nspeculation in this sense altogether.\r\n\r\nThe one point the catastrophists and the uniformitarians agreed upon,\r\nwhen this Society was founded, was to ignore it. And you will find, if\r\nyou look back into our records, that our revered fathers in geology\r\nplumed themselves a good deal upon the practical sense and wisdom of this\r\nproceeding. As a temporary measure, I do not presume to challenge its\r\nwisdom; but in all organised bodies temporary changes are apt to produce\r\npermanent effects; and as time has slipped by, altering all the\r\nconditions which may have made such mortification of the scientific flesh\r\ndesirable, I think the effect of the stream of cold water which has\r\nsteadily flowed over geological speculation within these walls has been\r\nof doubtful beneficence.\r\n\r\nThe sort of geological speculation to which I am now referring\r\n(geological aetiology, in short) was created, as a science, by that famous\r\nphilosopher Immanuel Kant, when, in 1775, he wrote his \"General Natural\r\nHistory and Theory of the Celestial Bodies; or an Attempt to account for\r\nthe Constitutional and the Mechanical Origin of the Universe upon\r\nNewtonian principles.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Grant (_History of Physical Astronomy_, p. 574) makes but\r\nthe briefest reference to Kant.]\r\n\r\nIn this very remarkable but seemingly little-known treatise,[12] Kant\r\nexpounds a complete cosmogony, in the shape of a theory of the causes\r\nwhich have led to the development of the universe from diffused atoms of\r\nmatter endowed with simple attractive and repulsive forces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: \"Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels; oder\r\nVersuch von der Verfassung und dem mechanischen Ursprunge des ganzen\r\nWeltgebäudes nach Newton'schen Grundsatzen abgehandelt.\"--KANT'S\r\n_Sämmtliche Werke_, Bd. i. p. 207.]\r\n\r\n\"Give me matter,\" says Kant, \"and I will build the world;\" and he\r\nproceeds to deduce from the simple data from which he starts, a doctrine\r\nin all essential respects similar to the well-known \"Nebular Hypothesis\"\r\nof Laplace.[13] He accounts for the relation of the masses and the\r\ndensities of the planets to their distances from the sun, for the\r\neccentricities of their orbits, for their rotations, for their\r\nsatellites, for the general agreement in the direction of rotation among\r\nthe celestial bodies, for Saturn's ring, and for the zodiacal light. He\r\nfinds in each system of worlds, indications that the attractive force of\r\nthe central mass will eventually destroy its organisation, by\r\nconcentrating upon itself the matter of the whole system; but, as the\r\nresult of this concentration, he argues for the development of an amount\r\nof heat which will dissipate the mass once more into a molecular chaos\r\nsuch as that in which it began.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: _Système du Monde_, tome ii. chap. 6.]\r\n\r\nKant pictures to himself the universe as once an infinite expansion of\r\nformless and diffused matter. At one point of this he supposes a single\r\ncentre of attraction set up; and, by strict deductions from admitted\r\ndynamical principles, shows how this must result in the development of a\r\nprodigious central body, surrounded by systems of solar and planetary\r\nworlds in all stages of development. In vivid language he depicts the\r\ngreat world-maelstrom, widening the margins of its prodigious eddy in the\r\nslow progress of millions of ages, gradually reclaiming more and more of\r\nthe molecular waste, and converting chaos into cosmos. But what is gained\r\nat the margin is lost in the centre; the attractions of the central\r\nsystems bring their constituents together, which then, by the heat\r\nevolved, are converted once more into molecular chaos. Thus the worlds\r\nthat are, lie between the ruins of the worlds that have been, and the\r\nchaotic materials of the worlds that shall be; and in spite of all waste\r\nand destruction, Cosmos is extending his borders at the expense of Chaos.\r\n\r\nKant's further application of his views to the earth itself is to be\r\nfound in his \"Treatise on Physical Geography\"[14] (a term under which the\r\nthen unknown science of geology was included), a subject which he had\r\nstudied with very great care and on which he lectured for many years. The\r\nfourth section of the first part of this Treatise is called \"History of\r\nthe great Changes which the Earth has formerly undergone and is still\r\nundergoing,\" and is, in fact, a brief and pregnant essay upon the\r\nprinciples of geology. Kant gives an account first \"of the gradual\r\nchanges which are now taking place\" under the heads of such as are caused\r\nby earthquakes, such as are brought about by rain and rivers, such as are\r\neffected by the sea, such as are produced by winds and frost; and,\r\nfinally, such as result from the operations of man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Kant's _Sämmtliche Werke_, Bd. viii. p. 145.]\r\n\r\nThe second part is devoted to the \"Memorials of the Changes which the\r\nEarth has undergone in remote Antiquity.\" These are enumerated as:--A.\r\nProofs that the sea formerly covered the whole earth. B. Proofs that the\r\nsea has often been changed into dry land and then again into sea. C. A\r\ndiscussion of the various theories of the earth put forward by\r\nScheuchzer, Moro, Bonnet, Woodward, White, Leibnitz, Linnaeus, and Buffon.\r\n\r\nThe third part contains an \"Attempt to give a sound explanation of the\r\nancient history of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nI suppose that it would be very easy to pick holes in the details of\r\nKant's speculations, whether cosmological, or specially telluric, in\r\ntheir application. But for all that, he seems to me to have been the\r\nfirst person to frame a complete system of geological speculation by\r\nfounding the doctrine of evolution.\r\n\r\nWith as much truth as Hutton, Kant could say, \"I take things just as I\r\nfind them at present, and, from these, I reason with regard to that which\r\nmust have been.\" Like Hutton, he is never tired of pointing out that \"in\r\nNature there is wisdom, system, and consistency.\" And, as in these great\r\nprinciples, so in believing that the cosmos has a reproductive operation\r\n\"by which a ruined constitution may be repaired,\" he forestalls Hutton;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, Kant is true to science. He knows no bounds to\r\ngeological speculation but those of the intellect. He reasons back to a\r\nbeginning of the present state of things; he admits the possibility of an\r\nend.\r\n\r\nI have said that the three schools of geological speculation which I have\r\ntermed Catastrophism, Uniformitarianism, and Evolutionism, are commonly\r\nsupposed to be antagonistic to one another; and I presume it will have\r\nbecome obvious that in my belief, the last is destined to swallow up the\r\nother two. But it is proper to remark that each of the latter has kept\r\nalive the tradition of precious truths.\r\n\r\nCATASTROPHISM has insisted upon the existence of a practically unlimited\r\nbank of force, on which the theorist might draw; and it has cherished the\r\nidea of the development of the earth from a state in which its form, and\r\nthe forces which it exerted, were very different from those we now know.\r\nThat such difference of form and power once existed is a necessary part\r\nof the doctrine of evolution.\r\n\r\nUNIFORMITARIANISM, on the other hand, has with equal justice insisted\r\nupon a practically unlimited bank of time, ready to discount any quantity\r\nof hypothetical paper. It has kept before our eyes the power of the\r\ninfinitely little, time being granted, and has compelled us to exhaust\r\nknown causes, before flying to the unknown.\r\n\r\nTo my mind there appears to be no sort of necessary theoretical\r\nantagonism between Catastrophism and Uniformitarianism. On the contrary,\r\nit is very conceivable that catastrophes may be part and parcel of\r\nuniformity. Let me illustrate my case by analogy. The working of a clock\r\nis a model of uniform action; good time-keeping means uniformity of\r\naction. But the striking of the clock is essentially a catastrophe; the\r\nhammer might be made to blow up a barrel of gunpowder, or turn on a\r\ndeluge of water; and, by proper arrangement, the clock, instead of\r\nmarking the hours, might strike at all sorts of irregular periods, never\r\ntwice alike, in the intervals, force, or number of its blows.\r\nNevertheless, all these irregular, and apparently lawless, catastrophes\r\nwould be the result of an absolutely uniformitarian action; and we might\r\nhave two schools of clock-theorists, one studying the hammer and the\r\nother the pendulum.\r\n\r\nStill less is there any necessary antagonists between either of these\r\ndoctrines and that of Evolution, which embraces all that is sound in both\r\nCatastrophism and Uniformitarianism, while it rejects the arbitrary\r\nassumptions of the one and the, as arbitrary, limitations of the other.\r\nNor is the value of the doctrine of Evolution to the philosophic thinker\r\ndiminished by the fact that it applies the same method to the living and\r\nthe not-living world; and embraces, in one stupendous analogy, the growth\r\nof a solar system from molecular chaos, the shaping of the earth from the\r\nnebulous cub-hood of its youth, through innumerable changes and\r\nimmeasurable ages, to its present form; and the development of a living\r\nbeing from the shapeless mass of protoplasm we term a germ.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Evolutionism can claim that amount of currency\r\nwhich would entitle it to be called British popular geology; but, more or\r\nless vaguely, it is assuredly present in the minds of most geologists.\r\n\r\nSuch being the three phases of geological speculation, we are now in\r\nposition to inquire which of these it is that Sir William Thomson calls\r\nupon us to reform in the passages which I have cited.\r\n\r\nIt is obviously Uniformitarianism which the distinguished physicist takes\r\nto be the representative of geological speculation in general. And thus a\r\nfirst issue is raised, inasmuch as many persons (and those not the least\r\nthoughtful among the younger geologists) do not accept strict\r\nUniformitarianism as the final form of geological speculation. We should\r\nsay, if Hutton and Playfair declare the course of the world to have been\r\nalways the same, point out the fallacy by all means; but, in so doing, do\r\nnot imagine that you are proving modern geology to be in opposition to\r\nnatural philosophy. I do not suppose that, at the present day, any\r\ngeologist would be found to maintain absolute Uniformitarianism, to deny\r\nthat the rapidity of the rotation of the earth _may_ be diminishing, that\r\nthe sun _may_ be waxing dim, or that the earth itself _may_ be cooling.\r\nMost of us, I suspect, are Gallios, \"who care for none of these things,\"\r\nbeing of opinion that, true or fictitious, they have made no practical\r\ndifference to the earth, during the period of which a record is preserved\r\nin stratified deposits.\r\n\r\nThe accusation that we have been running counter to the _principles_ of\r\nnatural philosophy, therefore, is devoid of foundation. The only question\r\nwhich can arise is whether we have, or have not, been tacitly making\r\nassumptions which are in opposition to certain conclusions which may be\r\ndrawn from those principles. And this question subdivides itself into\r\ntwo:--the first, are we really contravening such conclusions? the second,\r\nif we are, are those conclusions so firmly based that we may not\r\ncontravene them? I reply in the negative to both these questions, and I\r\nwill give you my reasons for so doing. Sir William Thomson believes that\r\nhe is able to prove, by physical reasonings, \"that the existing state of\r\nthings on the earth, life on the earth--all geological history showing\r\ncontinuity of life--must be limited within some such period of time as\r\none hundred million years\" (_loc. cit._ p. 25).\r\n\r\nThe first inquiry which arises plainly is, has it ever been denied that\r\nthis period _may_ be enough for the purposes of geology?\r\n\r\nThe discussion of this question is greatly embarrassed by the vagueness\r\nwith which the assumed limit is, I will not say defined, but indicated,--\r\n\"some such period of past time as one hundred million years.\" Now does\r\nthis mean that it may have been two, or three, or four hundred million\r\nyears? Because this really makes all the difference.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Sir William Thomson implies (_loc. cit_. p. 16) that the\r\nprecise time is of no consequence: \"the principle is the same\"; but, as\r\nthe principle is admitted, the whole discussion turns on its practical\r\nresults.]\r\n\r\nI presume that 100,000 feet may be taken as a full allowance for the\r\ntotal thickness of stratified rocks containing traces of life; 100,000\r\ndivided by 100,000,000 = 0.001. Consequently, the deposit of 100,000 feet\r\nof stratified rock in 100,000,000 years means that the deposit has taken\r\nplace at the rate of 1/1000 of a foot, or, say, 1/83 of an inch, per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nWell, I do not know that any one is prepared to maintain that, even\r\nmaking all needful allowances, the stratified rocks may not have been\r\nformed, on the average, at the rate of 1/83 of an inch per annum. I\r\nsuppose that if such could be shown to be the limit of world-growth, we\r\ncould put up with the allowance without feeling that our speculations had\r\nundergone any revolution. And perhaps, after all, the qualifying phrase\r\n\"some such period\" may not necessitate the assumption of more than 1/166\r\nor 1/249 or 1/332 of an inch of deposit per year, which, of course, would\r\ngive us still more ease and comfort.\r\n\r\nBut, it may be said, that it is biology, and not geology, which asks for\r\nso much time--that the succession of life demands vast intervals; but\r\nthis appears to me to be reasoning in a circle. Biology takes her time\r\nfrom geology. The only reason we have for believing in the slow rate of\r\nthe change in living forms is the fact that they persist through a series\r\nof deposits which, geology informs us, have taken a long while to make.\r\nIf the geological clock is wrong, all the naturalist will have to do is\r\nto modify his notions of the rapidity of change accordingly. And I\r\nventure to point out that, when we are told that the limitation of the\r\nperiod during which living beings have inhabited this planet to one, two,\r\nor three hundred million years requires a complete revolution in\r\ngeological speculation, the _onus probandi_ rests on the maker of the\r\nassertion, who brings forward not a shadow of evidence in its support.\r\n\r\nThus, if we accept the limitation of time placed before us by Sir W.\r\nThomson, it is not obvious, on the face of the matter, that we shall have\r\nto alter, or reform, our ways in any appreciable degree; and we may\r\ntherefore proceed with much calmness, and indeed much indifference, as to\r\nthe result, to inquire whether that limitation is justified by the\r\narguments employed in its support.\r\n\r\nThese arguments are three in number.--\r\n\r\nI. The first is based upon the undoubted fact that the tides tend to\r\nretard the rate of the earth's rotation upon its axis. That this must be\r\nso is obvious, if one considers, roughly, that the tides result from the\r\npull which the sun and the moon exert upon the sea, causing it to act as\r\na sort of break upon the rotating solid earth.\r\n\r\nKant, who was by no means a mere \"abstract philosopher,\" but a good\r\nmathematician and well versed in the physical science of his time, not\r\nonly proved this in an essay of exquisite clearness and intelligibility,\r\nnow more than a century old,[16] but deduced from it some of its more\r\nimportant consequences, such as the constant turning of one face of the\r\nmoon towards the earth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: \"Untersuchung der Frage oh die Erde in ihrer Umdrehung um\r\ndie Achse, wodurch sie die Abwechselung des Tages und der Nacht\r\nhervorbringt, einige Veränderung seit den ersten Zeiten ihres Ursprunges\r\nerlitten habe, &c.\"--KANT's _Sämmntliche Werke_, Bd. i. p. 178.]\r\n\r\nBut there is a long step from the demonstration of a tendency to the\r\nestimation of the practical value of that tendency, which is all with\r\nwhich we are at present concerned. The facts bearing on this point appear\r\nto stand as follows:--\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of observation that the moon's mean motion is (and has for\r\nthe last 3,000 years been) undergoing an acceleration, relatively to the\r\nrotation of the earth. Of course this may result from one of two causes:\r\nthe moon may really have been moving more swiftly in its orbit; or the\r\nearth may have been rotating more slowly on its axis.\r\n\r\nLaplace believed he had accounted for this phenomenon by the fact that\r\nthe eccentricity of the earth's orbit has been diminishing throughout\r\nthese 3,000 years. This would produce a diminution of the mean attraction\r\nof the sun on the moon; or, in other words, an increase in the attraction\r\nof the earth on the moon; and, consequently, an increase in the rapidity\r\nof the orbital motion of the latter body. Laplace, therefore, laid the\r\nresponsibility of the acceleration upon the moon, and if his views were\r\ncorrect, the tidal retardation must either be insignificant in amount, or\r\nbe counteracted by some other agency.\r\n\r\nOur great astronomer, Adams, however, appears to have found a flaw in\r\nLaplace's calculation, and to have shown that only half the observed\r\nretardation could be accounted for in the way he had suggested. There\r\nremains, therefore, the other half to be accounted for; and here, in the\r\nabsence of all positive knowledge, three sets of hypotheses have been\r\nsuggested.\r\n\r\n(_a_.) M. Delaunay suggests that the earth is at fault, in consequence of\r\nthe tidal retardation. Messrs. Adams, Thomson, and Tait work out this\r\nsuggestion, and, \"on a certain assumption as to the proportion of\r\nretardations due to the sun and moon,\" find the earth may lose twenty-two\r\nseconds of time in a century from this cause.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Sir W. Thomson, _loc. cit_. p. 14.]\r\n\r\n(_b_.) But M. Dufour suggests that the retardation of the earth (which is\r\nhypothetically assumed to exist) may be due in part, or wholly, to the\r\nincrease of the moment of inertia of the earth by meteors falling upon\r\nits surface. This suggestion also meets with the entire approval of Sir\r\nW. Thomson, who shows that meteor-dust, accumulating at the rate of one\r\nfoot in 4,000 years, would account for the remainder of retardation.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Ibid._ p. 27.]\r\n\r\n(_c_.) Thirdly, Sir W. Thomson brings forward an hypothesis of his own\r\nwith respect to the cause of the hypothetical retardation of the earth's\r\nrotation:--\r\n\r\n\"Let us suppose ice to melt from the polar regions (20° round each pole,\r\nwe may say) to the extent of something more than a foot thick, enough to\r\ngive 1.1 foot of water over those areas, or 0.006 of a foot of water if\r\nspread over the whole globe, which would, in reality, raise the sea-level\r\nby only some such undiscoverable difference as three-fourths of an inch\r\nor an inch. This, or the reverse, which we believe might happen any year,\r\nand could certainly not be detected without far more accurate\r\nobservations and calculations for the mean sea-level than any hitherto\r\nmade, would slacken or quicken the earth's rate as a timekeeper by one-\r\ntenth of a second per year.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Ibid._]\r\n\r\nI do not presume to throw the slightest doubt upon the accuracy of any of\r\nthe calculations made by such distinguished mathematicians as those who\r\nhave made the suggestions I have cited. On the contrary, it is necessary\r\nto my argument to assume that they are all correct. But I desire to point\r\nout that this seems to be one of the many cases in which the admitted\r\naccuracy of mathematical process is allowed to throw a wholly\r\ninadmissible appearance of authority over the results obtained by them.\r\nMathematics may be compared to a mill of exquisite workmanship, which\r\ngrinds you stuff of any degree of fineness; but, nevertheless, what you\r\nget out depends upon what you put in; and as the grandest mill in the\r\nworld will not extract wheat-flour from peascods, so pages of formulae\r\nwill not get a definite result out of loose data.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance it appears to be admitted:--\r\n\r\n1. That it is not absolutely certain, after all, whether the moon's mean\r\nmotion is undergoing acceleration, or the earth's rotation\r\nretardation.[20] And yet this is the key of the whole position.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: It will be understood that I do not wish to deny that the\r\nearth's rotation _may be_ undergoing retardation.]\r\n\r\n2. If the rapidity of the earth's rotation is diminishing, it is not\r\ncertain how much of that retardation is due to tidal friction, how much\r\nto meteors, how much to possible excess of melting over accumulation of\r\npolar ice, during the period covered by observation, which amounts, at\r\nthe outside, to not more than 2,600 years.\r\n\r\n3. The effect of a different distribution of land and water in modifying\r\nthe retardation caused by tidal friction, and of reducing it, under some\r\ncircumstances, to a minimum, does not appear to be taken into account.\r\n\r\n4. During the Miocene epoch the polar ice was certainly many feet thinner\r\nthan it has been during, or since, the Glacial epoch. Sir W. Thomson\r\ntells us that the accumulation of something more than a foot of ice\r\naround the poles (which implies the withdrawal of, say, an inch of water\r\nfrom the general surface of the sea) will cause the earth to rotate\r\nquicker by one-tenth of a second per annum. It would appear, therefore,\r\nthat the earth may have been rotating, throughout the whole period which\r\nhas elapsed from the commencement of the Glacial epoch down to the\r\npresent time, one, or more, seconds per annum quicker than it rotated\r\nduring the Miocene epoch.\r\n\r\nBut, according to Sir W. Thomson's calculation, tidal retardation will\r\nonly account for a retardation of 22\" in a century, or 22/100 (say 1/5)\r\nof a second per annum.\r\n\r\nThus, assuming that the accumulation of polar ice since the Miocene epoch\r\nhas only been sufficient to produce ten times the effect of a coat of ice\r\none foot thick, we shall have an accelerating cause which covers all the\r\nloss from tidal action, and leaves a balance of 4/5 of a second per annum\r\nin the way of acceleration.\r\n\r\nIf tidal retardation can be thus checked and overthrown by other\r\ntemporary conditions, what becomes of the confident assertion, based upon\r\nthe assumed uniformity of tidal retardation, that ten thousand million\r\nyears ago the earth must have been rotating more than twice as fast as at\r\npresent, and, therefore, that we geologists are \"in direct opposition to\r\nthe principles of Natural Philosophy\" if we spread geological history\r\nover that time?\r\n\r\nII. The second argument is thus stated by Sir W. Thomson:--\"An article,\r\nby myself, published in 'Macmillan's Magazine' for March 1862, on the age\r\nof the sun's heat, explains results of investigation into various\r\nquestions as to possibilities regarding the amount of heat that the sun\r\ncould have, dealing with it as you would with a stone, or a piece of\r\nmatter, only taking into account the sun's dimensions, which showed it to\r\nbe possible that the sun may have already illuminated the earth for as\r\nmany as one hundred million years, but at the same time rendered it\r\nalmost certain that he had not illuminated the earth for five hundred\r\nmillions of years. The estimates here are necessarily very vague; but\r\nyet, vague as they are, I do not know that it is possible, upon any\r\nreasonable estimate founded on known properties of matter, to say that we\r\ncan believe the sun has really illuminated the earth for five hundred\r\nmillion years.\"[21]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: _Loc. cit._ p. 20.]\r\n\r\nI do not wish to \"Hansardise\" Sir William Thomson by laying much stress\r\non the fact that, only fifteen years ago he entertained a totally\r\ndifferent view of the origin of the sun's heat, and believed that the\r\nenergy radiated from year to year was supplied from year to year--a\r\ndoctrine which would have suited Hutton perfectly. But the fact that so\r\neminent a physical philosopher has, thus recently, held views opposite to\r\nthose which he now entertains, and that he confesses his own estimates to\r\nbe \"very vague,\" justly entitles us to disregard those estimates, if any\r\ndistinct facts on our side go against them. However, I am not aware that\r\nsuch facts exist. As I have already said, for anything I know, one, two,\r\nor three hundred millions of years may serve the needs of geologists\r\nperfectly well.\r\n\r\nIII. The third line of argument is based upon the temperature of the\r\ninterior of the earth. Sir W. Thomson refers to certain investigations\r\nwhich prove that the present thermal condition of the interior of the\r\nearth implies either a heating of the earth within the last 20,000 years\r\nof as much as 100° F., or a greater heating all over the surface at some\r\ntime further back than 20,000 years, and then proceeds thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Now, are geologists prepared to admit that, at some time within the last\r\n20,000 years, there has been all over the earth so high a temperature as\r\nthat? I presume not; no geologist--no _modern_ geologist--would for a\r\nmoment admit the hypothesis that the present state of underground heat is\r\ndue to a heating of the surface at so late a period as 20,000 years ago.\r\nIf that is not admitted we are driven to a greater heat at some time more\r\nthan 20,000 years ago. A greater heating all over the surface than 100°\r\nFahrenheit would kill nearly all existing plants and animals, I may\r\nsafely say. Are modern geologists prepared to say that all life was\r\nkilled off the earth 50,000, 100,000, or 200,000 years ago? For the\r\nuniformity theory, the further back the time of high surface-temperature\r\nis put the better; but the further back the time of heating, the hotter\r\nit must have been. The best for those who draw most largely on time is\r\nthat which puts it furthest back; and that is the theory that the heating\r\nwas enough to melt the whole. But even if it was enough to melt the\r\nwhole, we must still admit some limit, such as fifty million years, one\r\nhundred million years, or two or three hundred million years ago. Beyond\r\nthat we cannot go.\"[22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: _Loc. cit._ p. 24.]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the \"limit\" is once again of the vaguest,\r\nranging from 50,000,000 years to 300,000,000. And the reply is, once\r\nmore, that, for anything that can be proved to the contrary, one or two\r\nhundred million years might serve the purpose, even of a thoroughgoing\r\nHuttonian uniformitarian, very well.\r\n\r\nBut if, on the other hand, the 100,000,000 or 200,000,000 years appear to\r\nbe insufficient for geological purposes, we must closely criticise the\r\nmethod by which the limit is reached. The argument is simple enough.\r\n_Assuming_ the earth to be nothing but a cooling mass, the quantity of\r\nheat lost per year, _supposing_ the rate of cooling to have been uniform,\r\nmultiplied by any given number of years, will be given the minimum\r\ntemperature that number of years ago.\r\n\r\nBut is the earth nothing but a cooling mass, \"like a hot-water jar such\r\nas is used in carriages,\" or \"a globe of sandstone,\" and has its cooling\r\nbeen uniform? An affirmative answer to both these questions seems to be\r\nnecessary to the validity of the calculations on which Sir W. Thomson\r\nlays so much stress.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it surely may be urged that such affirmative answers are\r\npurely hypothetical, and that other suppositions have an equal right to\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nFor example, is it not possible that, at the prodigious temperature which\r\nwould seem to exist at 100 miles below the surface, all the metallic\r\nbases may behave as mercury does at a red heat, when it refuses to\r\ncombine with oxygen; while, nearer the surface, and therefore at a lower\r\ntemperature, they may enter into combination (as mercury does with oxygen\r\na few degrees below its boiling-point), and so give rise to a heat\r\ntotally distinct from that which they possess as cooling bodies? And has\r\nit not also been proved by recent researches that the quality of the\r\natmosphere may immensely affect its permeability to heat; and,\r\nconsequently, profoundly modify the rate of cooling the globe as a whole?\r\n\r\nI do not think it can be denied that such conditions may exist, and may\r\nso greatly affect the supply, and the loss, of terrestrial heat as to\r\ndestroy the value of any calculations which leave them out of sight.\r\n\r\nMy functions as your advocate are at an end. I speak with more than the\r\nsincerity of a mere advocate when I express the belief that the case\r\nagainst us has entirely broken down. The cry for reform which has been\r\nraised without, is superfluous, inasmuch as we have long been reforming\r\nfrom within, with all needful speed. And the critical examination of the\r\ngrounds upon which the very grave charge of opposition to the principles\r\nof Natural Philosophy has been brought against us, rather shows that we\r\nhave exercised a wise discrimination in declining, for the present, to\r\nmeddle with our foundations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\n\r\nPALAEONTOLOGY AND THE DOCTRINE OF EVOLUTION\r\n\r\n[1870]\r\n\r\nIt is now eight years since, in the absence of the late Mr. Leonard\r\nHorner, who then presided over us, it fell to my lot, as one of the\r\nSecretaries of this Society, to draw up the customary Annual Address. I\r\navailed myself of the opportunity to endeavour to \"take stock\" of that\r\nportion of the science of biology which is commonly called\r\n\"palaeontology,\" as it then existed; and, discussing one after another the\r\ndoctrines held by palaeontologists, I put before you the results of my\r\nattempts to sift the well-established from the hypothetical or the\r\ndoubtful. Permit me briefly to recall to your minds what those results\r\nwere:--\r\n\r\n1. The living population of all parts of the earth's surface which have\r\nyet been examined has undergone a succession of changes which, upon the\r\nwhole, have been of a slow and gradual character.\r\n\r\n2. When the fossil remains which are the evidences of these successive\r\nchanges, as they have occurred in any two more or less distant parts of\r\nthe surface of the earth, are compared, they exhibit a certain broad and\r\ngeneral parallelism. In other words, certain forms of life in one\r\nlocality occur in the same general order of succession as, or are\r\n_homotaxial_ with, similar forms in the other locality.\r\n\r\n3. Homotaxis is not to be held identical with synchronism without\r\nindependent evidence. It is possible that similar, or even identical,\r\nfaunae and florae in two different localities may be of extremely different\r\nages, if the term \"age\" is used in its proper chronological sense. I\r\nstated that \"geographical provinces, or zones, may have been as\r\ndistinctly marked in the Palaeozoic epoch as at present; and those\r\nseemingly sudden appearances of new genera and species which we ascribe\r\nto new creation, may be simple results of migration.\"\r\n\r\n4. The opinion that the oldest known fossils are the earliest forms of\r\nlife has no solid foundation.\r\n\r\n5. If we confine ourselves to positively ascertained facts, the total\r\namount of change in the forms of animal and vegetable life, since the\r\nexistence of such forms is recorded, is small. When compared with the\r\nlapse of time since the first appearance of these forms, the amount of\r\nchange is wonderfully small. Moreover, in each great group of the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdoms, there are certain forms which I termed PERSISTENT\r\nTYPES, which have remained, with but very little apparent change, from\r\ntheir first appearance to the present time.\r\n\r\n6. In answer to the question \"What, then, does an impartial survey of the\r\npositively ascertained truths of palaeontology testify in relation to the\r\ncommon doctrines of progressive modification, which suppose that\r\nmodification to have taken place by a necessary progress from more to\r\nless embryonic forms, from more to less generalised types, within the\r\nlimits of the period represented by the fossiliferous rocks?\" I reply,\r\n\"It negatives these doctrines; for it either shows us no evidence of such\r\nmodification, or demonstrates such modification as has occurred to have\r\nbeen very slight; and, as to the nature of that modification, it yields\r\nno evidence whatsoever that the earlier members of any long-continued\r\ngroup were more generalised in structure than the later ones.\"\r\n\r\nI think that I cannot employ my last opportunity of addressing you,\r\nofficially, more properly--I may say more dutifully--than in revising\r\nthese old judgments with such help as further knowledge and reflection,\r\nand an extreme desire to get at the truth, may afford me.\r\n\r\n1. With respect to the first proposition, I may remark that whatever may\r\nbe the case among the physical geologists, catastrophic palaeontologists\r\nare practically extinct. It is now no part of recognised geological\r\ndoctrine that the species of one formation all died out and were replaced\r\nby a brand-new set in the next formation. On the contrary, it is\r\ngenerally, if not universally, agreed that the succession of life has\r\nbeen the result of a slow and gradual replacement of species by species;\r\nand that all appearances of abruptness of change are due to breaks in the\r\nseries of deposits, or other changes in physical conditions. The\r\ncontinuity of living forms has been unbroken from the earliest times to\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n2, 3. The use of the word \"homotaxis\" instead of \"synchronism\" has not,\r\nso far as I know, found much favour in the eyes of geologists. I hope,\r\ntherefore, that it is a love for scientific caution, and not mere\r\npersonal affection for a bantling of my own, which leads me still to\r\nthink that the change of phrase is of importance, and that the sooner it\r\nis made, the sooner shall we get rid of a number of pitfalls which beset\r\nthe reasoner upon the facts and theories of geology.\r\n\r\nOne of the latest pieces of foreign intelligence which has reached us is\r\nthe information that the Austrian geologists have, at last, succumbed to\r\nthe weighty evidence which M. Barrande has accumulated, and have admitted\r\nthe doctrine of colonies. But the admission of the doctrine of colonies\r\nimplies the further admission that even identity of organic remains is no\r\nproof of the synchronism of the deposits which contain them.\r\n\r\n4. The discussions touching the _Eozoon,_ which commenced in 1864, have\r\nabundantly justified the fourth proposition. In 1862, the oldest record\r\nof life was in the Cambrian rocks; but if the _Eozoon_ be, as Principal\r\nDawson and Dr. Carpenter have shown so much reason for believing, the\r\nremains of a living being, the discovery of its true nature carried life\r\nback to a period which, as Sir William Logan has observed, is as remote\r\nfrom that during which the Cambrian rocks were deposited, as the Cambrian\r\nepoch itself is from the tertiaries. In other words, the ascertained\r\nduration of life upon the globe was nearly doubled at a stroke.\r\n\r\n5. The significance of persistent types, and of the small amount of\r\nchange which has taken place even in those forms which can be shown to\r\nhave been modified, becomes greater and greater in my eyes, the longer I\r\noccupy myself with the biology of the past.\r\n\r\nConsider how long a time has elapsed since the Miocene epoch. Yet, at\r\nthat time there is reason to believe that every important group in every\r\norder of the _Mammalia_ was represented. Even the comparatively scanty\r\nEocene fauna yields examples of the orders _Cheiroptera, Insectivora,\r\nRodentia_, and _Perissodactyla_; of _Artiodactyla_ under both the\r\nRuminant and the Porcine modifications; of _Caranivora, Cetacea_, and\r\n_Marsupialia_.\r\n\r\nOr, if we go back to the older half of the Mesozoic epoch, how truly\r\nsurprising it is to find every order of the _Reptilia_, except the\r\n_Ophidia_, represented; while some groups, such as the _Ornithoseclida_\r\nand the _Pterosauria_, more specialised than any which now exist,\r\nabounded.\r\n\r\nThere is one division of the _Amphibia_ which offers especially important\r\nevidence upon this point, inasmuch as it bridges over the gap between the\r\nMesozoic and the Palaeozoic formations (often supposed to be of such\r\nprodigious magnitude), extending, as it does, from the bottom of the\r\nCarboniferous series to the top of the Trias, if not into the Lias. I\r\nrefer to the Labyrinthodonts. As the Address of 1862 was passing through\r\nthe press, I was able to mention, in a note, the discovery of a large\r\nLabyrinthodont, with well-ossified vertebrae, in the Edinburgh coal-field.\r\nSince that time eight or ten distinct genera of Labyrinthodonts have been\r\ndiscovered in the Carboniferous rocks of England, Scotland, and Ireland,\r\nnot to mention the American forms described by Principal Dawson and\r\nProfessor Cope. So that, at the present time, the Labyrinthodont Fauna of\r\nthe Carboniferous rocks is more extensive and diversified than that of\r\nthe Trias, while its chief types, so far as osteology enables us to\r\njudge, are quite as highly organised. Thus it is certain that a\r\ncomparatively highly organised vertebrate type, such as that of the\r\nLabyrinthodonts, is capable of persisting, with no considerable change,\r\nthrough the period represented by the vast deposits which constitute the\r\nCarboniferous, the Permian, and the Triassic formations.\r\n\r\nThe very remarkable results which have been brought to light by the\r\nsounding and dredging operations, which have been carried on with such\r\nremarkable success by the expeditions sent out by our own, the American,\r\nand the Swedish Governments, under the supervision of able naturalists,\r\nhave a bearing in the same direction. These investigations have\r\ndemonstrated the existence, at great depths in the ocean, of living\r\nanimals in some cases identical with, in others very similar to, those\r\nwhich are found fossilised in the white chalk. The _Globigerinoe_,\r\nCyatholiths, Coccospheres, Discoliths in the one are absolutely identical\r\nwith those in the other; there are identical, or closely analogous,\r\nspecies of Sponges, Echinoderms, and Brachiopods. Off the coast of\r\nPortugal, there now lives a species of _Beryx_, which, doubtless, leaves\r\nits bones and scales here and there in the Atlantic ooze, as its\r\npredecessor left its spoils in the mud of the sea of the Cretaceous\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nMany years ago[1] I ventured to speak of the Atlantic mud as \"modern\r\nchalk,\" and I know of no fact inconsistent with the view which Professor\r\nWyville Thomson has advocated, that the modern chalk is not only the\r\nlineal descendant of the ancient chalk, but that it remains, so to speak,\r\nin the possession of the ancestral estate; and that from the Cretaceous\r\nperiod (if not much earlier) to the present day, the deep sea has covered\r\na large part of what is now the area of the Atlantic. But if\r\n_Globigerina_, and _Terebratula caput-serpentis_ and _Beryx_, not to\r\nmention other forms of animals and of plants, thus bridge over the\r\ninterval between the present and the Mesozoic periods, is it possible\r\nthat the majority of other living things underwent a \"sea-change into\r\nsomething new and strange\" all at once?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See an article in the _Saturday Review_, for 1858, on\r\n\"Chalk, Ancient and Modern.\"]\r\n\r\n6. Thus far I have endeavoured to expand and to enforce by fresh\r\narguments, but not to modify in any important respect, the ideas\r\nsubmitted to you on a former occasion. But when I come to the\r\npropositions touching progressive modification, it appears to me, with\r\nthe help of the new light which has broken from various quarters, that\r\nthere is much ground for softening the somewhat Brutus-like severity with\r\nwhich, in 1862, I dealt with a doctrine, for the truth of which I should\r\nhave been glad enough to be able to find a good foundation. So far,\r\nindeed, as the _Invertebrata_ and the lower _Vertebrata_ are concerned,\r\nthe facts and the conclusions which are to be drawn from them appear to\r\nme to remain what they were. For anything that, as yet, appears to the\r\ncontrary, the earliest known Marsupials may have been as highly organised\r\nas their living congeners; the Permian lizards show no signs of\r\ninferiority to those of the present day; the Labyrinthodonts cannot be\r\nplaced below the living Salamander and Triton; the Devonian Ganoids are\r\nclosely related to _Polypterus_ and to _Lepidosiren_.\r\n\r\nBut when we turn to the higher _Vertebrata_, the results of recent\r\ninvestigations, however we may sift and criticise them, seem to me to\r\nleave a clear balance in favour of the doctrine of the evolution of\r\nliving forms one from another. Nevertheless, in discussing this question,\r\nit is very necessary to discriminate carefully between the different\r\nkinds of evidence from fossil remains which are brought forward in favour\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\nEvery fossil which takes an intermediate place between forms of life\r\nalready known, may be said, so far as it is intermediate, to be evidence\r\nin favour of evolution, inasmuch as it shows a possible road by which\r\nevolution may have taken place. But the mere discovery of such a form\r\ndoes not, in itself, prove that evolution took place by and through it,\r\nnor does it constitute more than presumptive evidence in favour of\r\nevolution in general. Suppose A, B, C to be three forms, while B is\r\nintermediate in structure between A and C. Then the doctrine of evolution\r\noffers four possible alternatives. A may have become C by way of B; or C\r\nmay have become A by way of B; or A and C may be independent\r\nmodifications of B; or A, B, and C may be independent modifications of\r\nsome unknown D. Take the case of the Pigs, the _Anoplothcridoe_, and the\r\nRuminants. The _Anoplothcridoe_ are intermediate between the first and\r\nthe last; but this does not tell us whether the Ruminants have come from\r\nthe Pigs, or the Pigs from Ruminants, or both from _Anoplothcridoe_, or\r\nwhether Pigs, Ruminants, and _Anoplotlicridoe_ alike may not have\r\ndiverged from some common stock.\r\n\r\nBut if it can be shown that A, B, and C exhibit successive stages in the\r\ndegree of modification, or specialisation, of the same type; and if,\r\nfurther, it can be proved that they occur in successively newer deposits,\r\nA being in the oldest and C in the newest, then the intermediate\r\ncharacter of B has quite another importance, and I should accept it,\r\nwithout hesitation, as a link in the genealogy of C. I should consider\r\nthe burden of proof to be thrown upon any one who denied C to have been\r\nderived from A by way of B, or in some closely analogous fashion; for it\r\nis always probable that one may not hit upon the exact line of filiation,\r\nand, in dealing with fossils, may mistake uncles and nephews for fathers\r\nand sons.\r\n\r\nI think it necessary to distinguish between the former and the latter\r\nclasses of intermediate forms, as _intercalary types_ and _linear types_.\r\nWhen I apply the former term, I merely mean to say that as a matter of\r\nfact, the form B, so named, is intermediate between the others, in the\r\nsense in which the _Anoplotherium_ is intermediate between the Pigs and\r\nthe Ruminants--without either affirming, or denying, any direct genetic\r\nrelation between the three forms involved. When I apply the latter term,\r\non the other hand, I mean to express the opinion that the forms A, B, and\r\nC constitute a line of descent, and that B is thus part of the lineage of\r\nC.\r\n\r\nFrom the time when Cuvier's wonderful researches upon the extinct Mammals\r\nof the Paris gypsum first made intercalary types known, and caused them\r\nto be recognised as such, the number of such forms has steadily increased\r\namong the higher _Mammalia_. Not only do we now know numerous intercalary\r\nforins of _Ungulata_, but M. Gaudry's great monograph upon the fossils of\r\nPikermi (which strikes me as one of the most perfect pieces of\r\npalaeontological work I have seen for a long time) shows us, among the\r\nPrimates, _Mesopithecus_ as an intercalary form between the\r\n_Semnopitheci_ and the _Macaci_; and among the _Carnivora_, _Hyoenictis_\r\nand _Ictitherium_ as intercalary, or, perhaps, linear types between the\r\n_Viverridoe_ and the _Hyoenidoe_.\r\n\r\nHardly any order of the higher _Mammalia_ stands so apparently separate\r\nand isolated from the rest as that of the _Cetacea_; though a careful\r\nconsideration of the structure of the pinnipede _Carnivora_, or Seals,\r\nshows, in them, many an approximation towards the still more completely\r\nmarine mammals. The extinct _Zeuglodon_, however, presents us with an\r\nintercalary form between the type of the Seals and that of the Whales.\r\nThe skull of this great Eocene sea-monster, in fact, shows by the narrow\r\nand prolonged interorbital region; the extensive union of the parietal\r\nbones in a sagittal suture; the well-developed nasal bones; the distinct\r\nand large incisors implanted in premaxillary bones, which take a full\r\nshare in bounding the fore part of the gape; the two-fanged molar teeth\r\nwith triangular and serrated crowns, not exceeding five on each side in\r\neach jaw; and the existence of a deciduous dentition--its close relation\r\nwith the Seals. While, on the other hand, the produced rostral form of\r\nthe snout, the long symphysis, and the low coronary process of the\r\nmandible are approximations to the cetacean form of those parts.\r\n\r\nThe scapula resembles that of the cetacean _Hyperoodon_, but the supra-\r\nspinous fossa is larger and more seal-like; as is the humerus, which\r\ndiffers from that of the _Cetacea_ in presenting true articular surfaces\r\nfor the free jointing of the bones of the fore-arm. In the apparently\r\ncomplete absence of hinder limbs, and in the characters of the vertebral\r\ncolumn, the _Zeuglodon_ lies on the cetacean side of the boundary line;\r\nso that upon the whole, the Zeuglodonts, transitional as they are, are\r\nconveniently retained in the cetacean order. And the publication, in\r\n1864, of M. Van Beneden's memoir on the Miocene and Pliocene _Squalodon_,\r\nfurnished much better means than anatomists previously possessed of\r\nfitting in another link of the chain which connects the existing\r\n_Cetacea_ with _Zeuglodon_. The teeth are much more numerous, although\r\nthe molars exhibit the zeuglodont double fang; the nasal bones are very\r\nshort, and the upper surface of the rostrum presents the groove, filled\r\nup during life by the prolongation of the ethmoidal cartilage, which is\r\nso characteristic of the majority of the _Cetacea_.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that, just as among the existing _Carnivora_, the\r\nwalruses and the eared seals are intercalary forms between the fissipede\r\nCarnivora and the ordinary seals, so the Zeuglodonts are intercalary\r\nbetween the _Carnivora_, as a whole, and the _Cetacea_. Whether the\r\nZeuglodonts are also linear types in their relation to these two groups\r\ncannot be ascertained, until we have more definite knowledge than we\r\npossess at present, respecting the relations in time of the _Carnivora_\r\nand _Cetacea_.\r\n\r\nThus far we have been concerned with the intercalary types which occupy\r\nthe intervals between Families or Orders of the same class; but the\r\ninvestigations which have been carried on by Professor Gegenbaur,\r\nProfessor Cope, and myself into the structure and relations of the\r\nextinct reptilian forms of the _Ornithoscelida_ (or _Dinosauria_ and\r\n_Compsognatha_) have brought to light the existence of intercalary forms\r\nbetween what have hitherto been always regarded as very distinct classes\r\nof the vertebrate sub-kingdom, namely _Reptilia_ and _Aves_. Whatever\r\ninferences may, or may not, be drawn from the fact, it is now an\r\nestablished truth that, in many of these _Ornithoscelida_, the hind limbs\r\nand the pelvis are much more similar to those of Birds than they are to\r\nthose of Reptiles, and that these Bird-reptiles, or Reptile-birds, were\r\nmore or less completely bipedal.\r\n\r\nWhen I addressed you in 1862, I should have been bold indeed had I\r\nsuggested that palaeontology would before long show us the possibility of\r\na direct transition from the type of the lizard to that of the ostrich.\r\nAt the present moment, we have, in the _Ornithoscelida_, the intercalary\r\ntype, which proves that transition to be something more than a\r\npossibility; but it is very doubtful whether any of the genera of\r\n_Ornithoscelida_ with which we are at present acquainted are the actual\r\nlinear types by which the transition from the lizard to the bird was\r\neffected. These, very probably, are still hidden from us in the older\r\nformations.\r\n\r\nLet us now endeavour to find some cases of true linear types, or forms\r\nwhich are intermediate between others because they stand in a direct\r\ngenetic relation to them. It is no easy matter to find clear and\r\nunmistakable evidence of filiation among fossil animals; for, in order\r\nthat such evidence should be quite satisfactory, it is necessary that we\r\nshould be acquainted with all the most important features of the\r\norganisation of the animals which are supposed to be thus related, and\r\nnot merely with the fragments upon which the genera and species of the\r\npalaeontologist are so often based. M. Gaudry has arranged the species of\r\n_Hyoenidoe, Proboscidea, Rhinocerotidoe_, and _Equidoe_ in their order of\r\nfiliation from their earliest appearance in the Miocene epoch to the\r\npresent time, and Professor Rütimeyer has drawn up similar schemes for\r\nthe Oxen and other _Ungulata_--with what, I am disposed to think, is a\r\nfair and probable approximation to the order of nature. But, as no one is\r\nbetter aware than these two learned, acute, and philosophical biologists,\r\nall such arrangements must be regarded as provisional, except in those\r\ncases in which, by a fortunate accident, large series of remains are\r\nobtainable from a thick and widespread series of deposits. It is easy to\r\naccumulate probabilities--hard to make out some particular case in such a\r\nway that it will stand rigorous criticism.\r\n\r\nAfter much search, however, I think that such a case is to be made out in\r\nfavour of the pedigree of the Horses.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Equus_ is represented as far back as the latter part of the\r\nMiocene epoch; but in deposits belonging to the middle of that epoch its\r\nplace is taken by two other genera, _Hipparion_ and _Anchitherium_;[2]\r\nand, in the lowest Miocene and upper Eocene, only the last genus occurs.\r\nA species of _Anchitherium_ was referred by Cuvier to the _Paloeotheria_\r\nunder the name of _P. aurelianense_. The grinding-teeth are in fact very\r\nsimilar in shape and in pattern, and in the absence of any thick layer of\r\ncement, to those of some species of _Paloeotherium_, especially Cuvier's\r\n_Paloeotherium minus_, which has been formed into a separate genus,\r\n_Plagiolophus_, by Pomel. But in the fact that there are only six full-\r\nsized grinders in the lower jaw, the first premolar being very small;\r\nthat the anterior grinders are as large as, or rather larger than, the\r\nposterior ones; that the second premolar has an anterior prolongation;\r\nand that the posterior molar of the lower jaw has, as Cuvier pointed out,\r\na posterior lobe of much smaller size and different form, the dentition\r\nof _Anchitherium_ departs from the type of the _Paloeotherium_, and\r\napproaches that of the Horse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Hermann von Meyer gave the name of _Anchitherium_ to _A.\r\nEzquerroe_; and in his paper on the subject he takes great pains to\r\ndistinguish the latter as the type of a new genus, from Cuvier's\r\n_Paloeotherium d'Orléans_. But it is precisely the _Paloeotherium\r\nd'Orléans_ which is the type of Christol's genus _Hipparitherium_; and\r\nthus, though _Hipparitherium_ is of later date than _Anchitherium_, it\r\nseemed to me to have a sort of equitable right to recognition when this\r\nAddress was written. On the whole, however, it seems most convenient to\r\nadopt _Anchitherium_.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the skeleton of _Anchitherium_ is extremely equine. M. Christol\r\ngoes so far as to say that the description of the bones of the horse, or\r\nthe ass, current in veterinary works, would fit those of _Anchitherium_.\r\nAnd, in a general way, this may be true enough; but there are some most\r\nimportant differences, which, indeed, are justly indicated by the same\r\ncareful observer. Thus the ulna is complete throughout, and its shaft is\r\nnot a mere rudiment, fused into one bone with the radius. There are three\r\ntoes, one large in the middle and one small on each side. The femur is\r\nquite like that of a horse, and has the characteristic fossa above the\r\nexternal condyle. In the British Museum there is a most instructive\r\nspecimen of the leg-bones, showing that the fibula was represented by the\r\nexternal malleolus and by a flat tongue of bone, which extends up from it\r\non the outer side of the tibia, and is closely ankylosed with the latter\r\nbone.[3] The hind toes are three, like those of the fore leg; and the\r\nmiddle metatarsal bone is much less compressed from side to side than\r\nthat of the horse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I am indebted to M. Gervais for a specimen which indicates\r\nthat the fibula was complete, at any rate, in some cases; and for a very\r\ninteresting ramps of a mandible, which shows that, as in the\r\n_Paloeotheria_, the hindermost milk-molar of the lower jaw was devoid of\r\nthe posterior lobe which exists in the hindermost true molar.]\r\n\r\nIn the _Hipparion_, the teeth nearly resemble those of the Horses, though\r\nthe crowns of the grinders are not so long; like those of the Horses,\r\nthey are abundantly coated with cement. The shaft of the ulna is reduced\r\nto a mere style, ankylosed throughout nearly its whole length with the\r\nradius, and appearing to be little more than a ridge on the surface of\r\nthe latter bone until it is carefully examined. The front toes are still\r\nthree, but the outer ones are more slender than in _Anchitherium_, and\r\ntheir hoofs smaller in proportion to that of the middle toe; they are, in\r\nfact, reduced to mere dew-claws, and do not touch the ground. In the leg,\r\nthe distal end of the fibula is so completely united with the tibia that\r\nit appears to be a mere process of the latter bone, as in the Horses.\r\n\r\nIn _Equus_, finally, the crowns of the grinding-teeth become longer, and\r\ntheir patterns are slightly modified; the middle of the shaft of the ulna\r\nusually vanishes, and its proximal and distal ends ankylose with the\r\nradius. The phalanges of the two outer toes in each foot disappear, their\r\nmetacarpal and metatarsal bones being left as the \"splints.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Hipparion_ has large depressions on the face in front of the orbits,\r\nlike those for the \"larmiers\" of many ruminants; but traces of these are\r\nto be seen in some of the fossil horses from the Sewalik Hills; and, as\r\nLeidy's recent researches show, they are preserved in _Anchitherium_.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider these facts, and the further circumstance that the\r\nHipparions, the remains of which have been collected in immense numbers,\r\nwere subject, as M. Gaudry and others have pointed out, to a great range\r\nof variation, it appears to me impossible to resist the conclusion that\r\nthe types of the _Anchitherium_, of the _Hipparion_, and of the ancient\r\nHorses constitute the lineage of the modern Horses, the _Hipparion_ being\r\nthe intermediate stage between the other two, and answering to B in my\r\nformer illustration.\r\n\r\nThe process by which the _Anchitherium_ has been converted into _Equus_\r\nis one of specialisation, or of more and more complete deviation from\r\nwhat might be called the average form of an ungulate mammal. In the\r\nHorses, the reduction of some parts of the limbs, together with the\r\nspecial modification of those which are left, is carried to a greater\r\nextent than in any other hoofed mammals. The reduction is less and the\r\nspecialisation is less in the _Hipparion_, and still less in the\r\n_Anchitherium_; but yet, as compared with other mammals, the reduction\r\nand specialisation of parts in the _Anchitherium_ remain great.\r\n\r\nIs it not probable then, that, just as in the Miocene epoch, we find an\r\nancestral equine form less modified than _Equus_, so, if we go back to\r\nthe Eocene epoch, we shall find some quadruped related to the\r\n_Anchitherium_, as _Hipparion_ is related to _Equus_, and consequently\r\ndeparting less from the average form?\r\n\r\nI think that this desideratum is very nearly, if not quite, supplied by\r\n_Plagiolophus_, remains of which occur abundantly in some parts of the\r\nUpper and Middle Eocene formations. The patterns of the grinding-teeth of\r\n_Plagiolophus_ are similar to those of _Anchitherium_, and their crowns\r\nare as thinly covered with cement; but the grinders diminish in size\r\nforwards, and the last lower molar has a large hind lobe, convex outwards\r\nand concave inwards, as in _Palueotherium_. The ulna is complete and much\r\nlarger than in any of the _Equidoe_, while it is more slender than in\r\nmost of the true _Paloeotheria_; it is fixedly united, but not ankylosed,\r\nwith the radius. There are three toes in the fore limb, the outer ones\r\nbeing slender, but less attenuated than in the _Equidoe_. The femur is\r\nmore like that of the _Paloeotheria_ than that of the horse, and has only\r\na small depression above its outer condyle in the place of the great\r\nfossa which is so obvious in the _Equidoe_. The fibula is distinct, but\r\nvery slender, and its distal end is ankylosed with the tibia. There are\r\nthree toes on the hind foot having similar proportions to those on the\r\nfore foot. The principal metacarpal and metatarsal bones are flatter than\r\nthey are in any of the _Equidoe_; and the metacarpal bones are longer\r\nthan the metatarsals, as in the _Paloeotheria_.\r\n\r\nIn its general form, _Plagiolophus_ resembles a very small and slender\r\nhorse,[4] and is totally unlike the reluctant, pig-like creature depicted\r\nin Cuvier's restoration of his _Paloeotherium minus_ in the \"Ossemens\r\nFossiles.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Such, at least, is the conclusion suggested by the\r\nproportions of the skeleton figured by Cuvier and De Blainville; but\r\nperhaps something between a Horse and an Agouti would be nearest the\r\nmark.]\r\n\r\nIt would be hazardous to say that _Plagiolophus_ is the exact radical\r\nform of the Equine quadrupeds; but I do not think there can be any\r\nreasonable doubt that the latter animals have resulted from the\r\nmodification of some quadruped similar to _Plagiolophus_.\r\n\r\nWe have thus arrived at the Middle Eocene formation, and yet have traced\r\nback the Horses only to a three-toed stock; but these three-toed forms,\r\nno less than the Equine quadrupeds themselves, present rudiments of the\r\ntwo other toes which appertain to what I have termed the \"average\"\r\nquadruped. If the expectation raised by the splints of the Horses that,\r\nin some ancestor of the Horses, these splints would be found to be\r\ncomplete digits, has been verified, we are furnished with very strong\r\nreasons for looking for a no less complete verification of the\r\nexpectation that the three-toed _Plagiolophus_-like \"avus\" of the horse\r\nmust have had a five-toed \"atavus\" at some earlier period.\r\n\r\nNo such five-toed \"atavus,\" however, has yet made its appearance among\r\nthe few middle and older Eocene _Mammalia_ which are known.\r\n\r\nAnother series of closely affiliated forms, though the evidence they\r\nafford is perhaps less complete than that of the Equine series, is\r\npresented to us by the _Dichobune_ of the Eocene epoch, the\r\n_Cainotherium_ of the Miocene, and the _Tragulidoe_, or so-called \"Musk-\r\ndeer,\" of the present day.\r\n\r\nThe _Tragulidoe_; have no incisors in the upper jaw, and only six\r\ngrinding-teeth on each side of each jaw; while the canine is moved up to\r\nthe outer incisor, and there is a diastema in the lower jaw. There are\r\nfour complete toes on the hind foot, but the middle metatarsals usually\r\nbecome, sooner or later, ankylosed into a cannon bone. The navicular and\r\nthe cuboid unite, and the distal end of the fibula is ankylosed with the\r\ntibia.\r\n\r\nIn _Cainotherium_ and _Dichobune_ the upper incisors are fully developed.\r\nThere are seven grinders; the teeth form a continuous series without a\r\ndiastema. The metatarsals, the navicular and cuboid, and the distal end\r\nof the fibula, remain free. In the _Cainotherium_, also, the second\r\nmetacarpal is developed, but is much shorter than the third, while the\r\nfifth is absent or rudimentary. In this respect it resembles\r\n_Anoplotherium secundarium_. This circumstance, and the peculiar pattern\r\nof the upper molars in _Cainotherium_, lead me to hesitate in considering\r\nit as the actual ancestor of the modern _Tragulidoe_. If _Dichobune_ has\r\na fore-toed fore foot (though I am inclined to suspect that it resembles\r\n_Cainotherium_), it will be a better representative of the oldest forms\r\nof the Traguline series; but _Dichobune_ occurs in the Middle Eocene, and\r\nis, in fact, the oldest known artiodactyle mammal. Where, then, must we\r\nlook for its five-toed ancestor?\r\n\r\nIf we follow down other lines of recent and tertiary _Ungulata_, the same\r\nquestion presents itself. The Pigs are traceable back through the Miocene\r\nepoch to the Upper Eocene, where they appear in the two well-marked forms\r\nof _Hyopopotamus_ and _Choeropotamus_; but _Hyopotamus_ appears to have\r\nhad only two toes.\r\n\r\nAgain, all the great groups of the Ruminants, the _Bovidoe, Antilopidoe,\r\nCamelopardalidoe_, and _Cervidoe_, are represented in the Miocene epoch,\r\nand so are the Camels. The Upper Eocene _Anoplotherium_, which is\r\nintercalary between the Pigs and the _Tragulidoe_, has only two, or, at\r\nmost, three toes. Among the scanty mammals of the Lower Eocene formation\r\nwe have the perissodactyle _Ungulata_ represented by _Coryphodon,\r\nHyracotherium_, and _Pliolophus_. Suppose for a moment, for the sake of\r\nfollowing out the argument, that _Pliolophus_ represents the primary\r\nstock of the Perissodactyles, and _Dichobune_ that of the Artiodactyles\r\n(though I am far from saying that such is the case), then we find, in the\r\nearliest fauna of the Eocene epoch to which our investigations carry us,\r\nthe two divisions of the _Ungulata_ completely differentiated, and no\r\ntrace of any common stock of both, or of five-toed predecessors to\r\neither. With the case of the Horses before us, justifying a belief in the\r\nproduction of new animal forms by modification of old ones, I see no\r\nescape from the necessity of seeking for these ancestors of the\r\n_Ungulata_ beyond the limits of the Tertiary formations.\r\n\r\nI could as soon admit special creation, at once, as suppose that the\r\nPerissodactyles and Artiodactyles had no five-toed ancestors. And when we\r\nconsider how large a portion of the Tertiary period elapsed before\r\n_Anchitherium_ was converted into _Equus_, it is difficult to escape the\r\nconclusion that a large proportion of time anterior to the Tertiary\r\nperiod must have been expended in converting the common stock of the\r\n_Ungulata_ into Perissodactyles and Artiodactyles.\r\n\r\nThe same moral is inculcated by the study of every other order of\r\nTertiary monodelphous _Mammalia_. Each of these orders is represented in\r\nthe Miocene epoch: the Eocene formation, as I have already said, contains\r\n_Cheiroptera, Insectivora, Rodentia, Ungulata, Carnivora_, and _Cetacea_.\r\nBut the _Cheiroptera_ are extreme modifications of the _Insectivora_,\r\njust as the _Cetacea_ are extreme modifications of the Carnivorous type;\r\nand therefore it is to my mind incredible that monodelphous _Insectivora_\r\nand _Carnivora_ should not have been abundantly developed, along with\r\n_Ungulata_, in the Mesozoic epoch. But if this be the case, how much\r\nfurther back must we go to find the common stock of the monodelphous\r\n_Mammalia_? As to the _Didelphia_, if we may trust the evidence which\r\nseems to be afforded by their very scanty remains, a Hypsiprymnoid form\r\nexisted at the epoch of the Trias, contemporaneously with a Carnivorous\r\nform. At the epoch of the Trias, therefore, the _Marsupialia_ must have\r\nalready existed long enough to have become differentiated into\r\ncarnivorous and herbivorous forms. But the _Monotremata_ are lower forms\r\nthan the _Didelphia_ which last are intercalary between the\r\n_Ornithodelphia_ and the _Monodelphia_. To what point of the Palaeozoic\r\nepoch, then, must we, upon any rational estimate, relegate the origin of\r\nthe _Monotremata?_\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the occurrence of the classes and of the orders of\r\nthe _Sauropsida_ in time points in exactly the same direction. If, as\r\nthere is great reason to believe, true Birds existed in the Triassic\r\nepoch, the ornithoscelidous forms by which Reptiles passed into Birds\r\nmust have preceded them. In fact there is, even at present, considerable\r\nground for suspecting the existence of _Dinosauria_ in the Permian\r\nformations; but, in that case, lizards must be of still earlier date. And\r\nif the very small differences which are observable between the\r\n_Crocodilia_ of the older Mesozoic formations and those of the present\r\nday furnish any sort of approximation towards an estimate of the average\r\nrate of change among the _Sauropsida_, it is almost appalling to reflect\r\nhow far back in Palaeozoic times we must go, before we can hope to arrive\r\nat that common stock from which the _Crocodilia, Lacertilia,\r\nOrnithoscelida_, and _Plesiosauria_, which had attained so great a\r\ndevelopment in the Triassic epoch, must have been derived.\r\n\r\nThe _Amphibia_ and _Pisces_ tell the same story. There is not a single\r\nclass of vertebrated animals which, when it first appears, is represented\r\nby analogues of the lowest known members of the same class. Therefore, if\r\nthere is any truth in the doctrine of evolution, every class must be\r\nvastly older than the first record of its appearance upon the surface of\r\nthe globe. But if considerations of this kind compel us to place the\r\norigin of vertebrated animals at a period sufficiently distant from the\r\nUpper Silurian, in which the first Elasmobranchs and Ganoids occur, to\r\nallow of the evolution of such fishes as these from a Vertebrate as\r\nsimple as the _Amphioxus,_ I can only repeat that it is appalling to\r\nspeculate upon the extent to which that origin must have preceded the\r\nepoch of the first recorded appearance of vertebrate life.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the further commentary which I have to offer upon the statement\r\nof the chief results of palaeontology which I formerly ventured to lay\r\nbefore you.\r\n\r\nBut the growth of knowledge in the interval makes me conscious of an\r\nomission of considerable moment in that statement, inasmuch as it\r\ncontains no reference to the bearings of palaeontology upon the theory of\r\nthe distribution of life; nor takes note of the remarkable manner in\r\nwhich the facts of distribution, in present and past times, accord with\r\nthe doctrine of evolution, especially in regard to land animals.\r\n\r\nThat connection between palaeontology and geology and the present\r\ndistribution of terrestrial animals, which so strikingly impressed Mr.\r\nDarwin, thirty years ago, as to lead him to speak of a \"law of succession\r\nof types,\" and of the wonderful relationship on the same continent\r\nbetween the dead and the living, has recently received much elucidation\r\nfrom the researches of Gaudry, of Rutimeyer, of Leidy, and of Alphonse\r\nMilne-Edwards, taken in connection with the earlier labours of our\r\nlamented colleague Falconer; and it has been instructively discussed in\r\nthe thoughtful and ingenious work of Mr. Andrew Murray \"On the\r\nGeographical Distribution of Mammals.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The paper \"On the Form and Distribution of the Landtracts\r\nduring the Secondary and Tertiary Periods respectively; and on the Effect\r\nupon Animal Life which great Changes in Geographical Configuration have\r\nprobably produced,\" by Mr. Searles V. Wood, jun., which was published in\r\nthe _Philosophical Magazine_, in 1862, was unknown to me when this\r\nAddress was written. It is well worthy of the most careful study.]\r\n\r\nI propose to lay before you, as briefly as I can, the ideas to which a\r\nlong consideration of the subject has given rise in my mind.\r\n\r\nIf the doctrine of evolution is sound, one of its immediate consequences\r\nclearly is, that the present distribution of life upon the globe is the\r\nproduct of two factors, the one being the distribution which obtained in\r\nthe immediately preceding epoch, and the other the character and the\r\nextent of the changes which have taken place in physical geography\r\nbetween the one epoch and the other; or, to put the matter in another\r\nway, the Fauna and Flora of any given area, in any given epoch, can\r\nconsist only of such forms of life as are directly descended from those\r\nwhich constituted the Fauna and Flora of the same area in the immediately\r\npreceding epoch, unless the physical geography (under which I include\r\nclimatal conditions) of the area has been so altered as to give rise to\r\nimmigration of living forms from some other area.\r\n\r\nThe evolutionist, therefore, is bound to grapple with the following\r\nproblem whenever it is clearly put before him:--Here are the Faunae of the\r\nsame area during successive epochs. Show good cause for believing either\r\nthat these Faunae have been derived from one another by gradual\r\nmodification, or that the Faunae have reached the area in question by\r\nmigration from some area in which they have undergone their development.\r\n\r\nI propose to attempt to deal with this problem, so far as it is\r\nexemplified by the distribution of the terrestrial _Vertebrata_, and I\r\nshall endeavour to show you that it is capable of solution in a sense\r\nentirely favourable to the doctrine of evolution.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere[6] stated at length the reasons which lead me to\r\nrecognise four primary distributional provinces for the terrestrial\r\n_Vertebrata_ in the present world, namely,--first, the _Novozelanian_, or\r\nNew-Zealand province; secondly, the _Australian_ province, including\r\nAustralia, Tasmania, and the Negrito Islands; thirdly, _Austro-Columbia_,\r\nor South America _plus_ North America as far as Mexico; and fourthly, the\r\nrest of the world, or _Arctogoea_, in which province America north of\r\nMexico constitutes one sub-province, Africa south of the Sahara a second,\r\nHindostan a third, and the remainder of the Old World a fourth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: \"On the Classification and Distribution of the\r\nAlectoromorphoe;\" _Proceedings of the Zoological Society_, 1868.]\r\n\r\nNow the truth which Mr. Darwin perceived and promulgated as \"the law of\r\nthe succession of types\" is, that, in all these provinces, the animals\r\nfound in Pliocene or later deposits are closely affined to those which\r\nnow inhabit the same provinces; and that, conversely, the forms\r\ncharacteristic of other provinces are absent. North and South America,\r\nperhaps, present one or two exceptions to the last rule, but they are\r\nreadily susceptible of explanation. Thus, in Australia, the later\r\nTertiary mammals are marsupials (possibly with the exception of the Dog\r\nand a Rodent or two, as at present). In Austro-Columbia, the later\r\nTertiary fauna exhibits numerous and varied forms of Platyrrhine Apes,\r\nRodents, Cats, Dogs, Stags, _Edentata_, and Opossums; but, as at present,\r\nno Catarrhine Apes, no Lemurs, no _Insectivora_, Oxen, Antelopes,\r\nRhinoceroses, nor _Didelphia_ other than Opossums. And in the widespread\r\nArctogaeal province, the Pliocene and later mammals belong to the same\r\ngroups as those which now exist in the province. The law of succession of\r\ntypes, therefore, holds good for the present epoch as compared with its\r\npredecessor. Does it equally well apply to the Pliocene fauna when we\r\ncompare it with that of the Miocene epoch? By great good fortune, an\r\nextensive mammalian fauna of the latter epoch has now become known, in\r\nfour very distant portions of the Arctogaeal province which do not differ\r\ngreatly in latitude. Thus Falconer and Cautley have made known the fauna\r\nof the sub-Himalayas and the Perim Islands; Gaudry that of Attica; many\r\nobservers that of Central Europe and France; and Leidy that of Nebraska,\r\non the eastern flank of the Rocky Mountains. The results are very\r\nstriking. The total Miocene fauna comprises many genera and species of\r\nCatarrhine Apes, of Bats, of _Insectivora_; of Arctogaeal types of\r\n_Rodentia_; of _Proboscidea_; of equine, rhinocerotic, and tapirine\r\nquadrupeds; of cameline, bovine, antilopine, cervine, and traguline\r\nRuminants; of Pigs and Hippopotamuses; of _Viverridoe_ and _Hyoenidoe_\r\namong other _Carnivora_; with _Edentata_ allied to the Aretogaeal\r\n_Oryeteropus_ and _Manis_, and not to the Austro-Columbian Edentates. The\r\nonly type present in the Miocene, but absent in the existing, fauna of\r\nEastern Arctogaea, is that of the _Didelphidoe_, which, however, remains\r\nin North America.\r\n\r\nBut it is very remarkable that while the Miocene fauna of the Arctogaeal\r\nprovince, as a whole, is of the same character as the existing fauna of\r\nthe same province, as a whole, the component elements of the fauna were\r\ndifferently associated. In the Miocene epoch, North America possessed\r\nElephants, Horses, Rhinoceroses, and a great number and variety of\r\nRuminants and Pigs, which are absent in the present indigenous fauna;\r\nEurope had its Apes, Elephants, Rhinoceroses, Tapirs, Musk-deer,\r\nGiraffes, Hyaenas, great Cats, Edentates, and Opossum-like Marsupials,\r\nwhich have equally vanished from its present fauna; and in Northern\r\nIndia, the African types of Hippopotamuses, Giraffes, and Elephants were\r\nmixed up with what are now the Asiatic types of the latter, and with\r\nCamels, and Semnopithecine and Pithecine Apes of no less distinctly\r\nAsiatic forms.\r\n\r\nIn fact the Miocene mammalian fauna of Europe and the Himalayan regions\r\ncontains, associated together, the types which are at present separately\r\nlocated in the South-African and Indian sub-provinces of Arctogaea. Now\r\nthere is every reason to believe, on other grounds, that both Hindostan,\r\nsouth of the Ganges, and Africa, south of the Sahara, were separated by a\r\nwide sea from Europe and North Asia during the Middle and Upper Eocene\r\nepochs. Hence it becomes highly probable that the well-known\r\nsimilarities, and no less remarkable differences between the present\r\nFaunae of India and South Africa have arisen in some such fashion as the\r\nfollowing. Some time during the Miocene epoch, possibly when the\r\nHimalayan chain was elevated, the bottom of the nummulitic sea was\r\nupheaved and converted into dry land, in the direction of a line\r\nextending from Abyssinia to the mouth of the Ganges. By this means, the\r\nDekhan on the one hand, and South Africa on the other, became connected\r\nwith the Miocene dry land and with one another. The Miocene mammals\r\nspread gradually over this intermediate dry land; and if the condition of\r\nits eastern and western ends offered as wide contrasts as the valleys of\r\nthe Ganges and Arabia do now, many forms which made their way into Africa\r\nmust have been different from those which reached the Dekhan, while\r\nothers might pass into both these sub-provinces.\r\n\r\nThat there was a continuity of dry land between Europe and North America\r\nduring the Miocene epoch, appears to me to be a necessary consequence of\r\nthe fact that many genera of terrestrial mammals, such as _Castor,\r\nHystrix, Elephas, Mastodon, Equus, Hipparion, Anchitherium, Rhinoceros,\r\nCervus, Amphicyon, Hyoenarctos_, and _Machairodus_, are common to the\r\nMiocene formations of the two areas, and have as yet been found (except\r\nperhaps _Anchitherium_) in no deposit of earlier age. Whether this\r\nconnection took place by the east, or by the west, or by both sides of\r\nthe Old World, there is at present no certain evidence, and the question\r\nis immaterial to the present argument; but, as there are good grounds for\r\nthe belief that the Australian province and the Indian and South-African\r\nsub-provinces were separated by sea from the rest of Arctogaea before the\r\nMiocene epoch, so it has been rendered no less probable, by the\r\ninvestigations of Mr. Carrick Moore and Professor Duncan, that Austro-\r\nColumbia was separated by sea from North America during a large part of\r\nthe Miocene epoch.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that we have no knowledge of the Miocene mammalian\r\nfauna of the Australian and Austro-Columbian provinces; but, seeing that\r\nnot a trace of a Platyrrhine Ape, of a Procyonine Carnivore, of a\r\ncharacteristically South-American Rodent, of a Sloth, an Armadillo, or an\r\nAnt-eater has yet been found in Miocene deposits of Arctogaea, I cannot\r\ndoubt that they already existed in the Miocene Austro-Columbian province.\r\n\r\nNor is it less probable that the characteristic types of Australian\r\nMammalia were already developed in that region in Miocene times.\r\n\r\nBut Austro-Columbia presents difficulties from which Australia is free;\r\n_Cantelidoe_ and _Tapirdoe_ are now indigenous in South America as they\r\nare in Arctogaea; and, among the Pliocene Austro-Columbian mammals, the\r\nArctogaeal genera _Equus, Mastodon,_ and _Machairodus_ are numbered. Are\r\nthese Postmiocene immigrants, or Praemiocene natives?\r\n\r\nStill more perplexing are the strange and interesting forms _Toxodon,\r\nMacrauchenia, Typotherium_, and a new Anoplotherioid mammal\r\n(_Homalodotherhon_) which Dr. Cunningham sent over to me some time ago\r\nfrom Patagonia. I confess I am strongly inclined to surmise that these\r\nlast, at any rate, are remnants of the population of Austro-Columbia\r\nbefore the Miocene epoch, and were not derived from Arctogaea by way of\r\nthe north and east.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this immense fauna of Miocene Arctogaea is now fully and\r\nrichly represented only in India and in South Africa, while it is shrunk\r\nand depauperised in North Asia, Europe, and North America, becomes at\r\nonce intelligible, if we suppose that India and South Africa had but a\r\nscanty mammalian population before the Miocene immigration, while the\r\nconditions were highly favourable to the new comers. It is to be supposed\r\nthat these new regions offered themselves to the Miocene Ungulates, as\r\nSouth America and Australia offered themselves to the cattle, sheep, and\r\nhorses of modern colonists. But, after these great areas were thus\r\npeopled, came the Glacial epoch, during which the excessive cold, to say\r\nnothing of depression and ice-covering, must have almost depopulated all\r\nthe northern parts of Arctogaea, destroying all the higher mammalian\r\nforms, except those which, like the Elephant and Rhinoceros, could adjust\r\ntheir coats to the altered conditions. Even these must have been driven\r\naway from the greater part of the area; only those Miocene mammals which\r\nhad passed into Hindostan and into South Africa would escape decimation\r\nby such changes in the physical geography of Arctogaea. And when the\r\nnorthern hemisphere passed into its present condition, these lost tribes\r\nof the Miocene Fauna were hemmed by the Himalayas, the Sahara, the Red\r\nSea, and the Arabian deserts, within their present boundaries.\r\n\r\nNow, on the hypothesis of evolution, there is no sort of difficulty in\r\nadmitting that the differences between the Miocene forms of the mammalian\r\nFauna and those which exist at present are the results of gradual\r\nmodification; and, since such differences in distribution as obtain are\r\nreadily explained by the changes which have taken place in the physical\r\ngeography of the world since the Miocene epoch, it is clear that the\r\nresult of the comparison of the Miocene and present Faunae is distinctly\r\nin favour of evolution. Indeed I may go further. I may say that the\r\nhypothesis of evolution explains the facts of Miocene, Pliocene, and\r\nRecent distribution, and that no other supposition even pretends to\r\naccount for them. It is, indeed, a conceivable supposition that every\r\nspecies of Rhinoceros and every species of Hyaena, in the long succession\r\nof forms between the Miocene and the present species, was separately\r\nconstructed out of dust, or out of nothing, by supernatural power; but\r\nuntil I receive distinct evidence of the fact, I refuse to run the risk\r\nof insulting any sane man by supposing that he seriously holds such a\r\nnotion.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a step further back in time, and inquire into the\r\nrelations between the Miocene Fauna and its predecessor of the Upper\r\nEocene formation.\r\n\r\nHere it is to be regretted that our materials for forming a judgment are\r\nnothing to be compared in point of extent or variety with those which are\r\nyielded by the Miocene strata. However, what we do know of this Upper\r\nEocene Fauna of Europe gives sufficient positive information to enable us\r\nto draw some tolerably safe inferences. It has yielded representatives of\r\n_Insectivora_, of _Cheiroptera_, of _Rodentia_, of _Carnivora_, of\r\nartiodactyle and perissodactyle _Ungulata_, and of opossum-like\r\nMarsupials. No Australian type of Marsupial has been discovered in the\r\nUpper Eocene strata, nor any Edentate mammal. The genera (except perhaps\r\nin the case of some of the _Insectivora, Cheiroptera_, and _Rodentia_)\r\nare different from those of the Miocene epoch, but present a remarkable\r\ngeneral similarity to the Miocene and recent genera. In several cases, as\r\nI have already shown, it has now been clearly made out that the relation\r\nbetween the Eocene and Miocene forms is such that the Eocene form is the\r\nless specialised; while its Miocene ally is more so, and the\r\nspecialisation reaches its maximum in the recent forms of the same type.\r\n\r\nSo far as the Upper Eocene and the Miocene Mammalian Faunae are\r\ncomparable, their relations are such as in no way to oppose the\r\nhypothesis that the older are the progenitors of the more recent forms,\r\nwhile, in some cases, they distinctly favour that hypothesis. The period\r\nin tine and the changes in physical geography represented by the\r\nnummulitic deposits are undoubtedly very great, while the remains of\r\nMiddle Eocene and Older Eocene Mammals are comparatively few. The general\r\nfacies of the Middle Eocene Fauna, however, is quite that of the Upper.\r\nThe Older Eocene pre-nummulitic mammalian Fauna contains Bats, two genera\r\nof _Carivora_, three genera of _Ungulata_ (probably all perissodactyle),\r\nand a didelphid Marsupial; all these forms, except perhaps the Bat and\r\nthe Opossum, belong to genera which are not known to occur out of the\r\nLower Eocene formation. The _Coryphodon_ appears to have been allied to\r\nthe Miocene and later Tapirs, while _Pliolophus_, in its skull and\r\ndentition, curiously partakes of both artiodactyle and perissodactyle\r\ncharacters; the third trochanter upon its femur, and its three-toed hind\r\nfoot, however, appear definitely to fix its position in the latter\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, then, in what is known of the older Eocene mammals of\r\nthe Arctogaeal province to forbid the supposition that they stood in an\r\nancestral relation to those of the Calcaire Grossier and the Gypsum of\r\nthe Paris basin, and that our present fauna, therefore, is directly\r\nderived from that which already existed in Arctogaea at the commencement\r\nof the Tertiary period. But if we now cross the frontier between the\r\nCainozoic and the Mesozoic faunae, as they are preserved within the\r\nArctogaeal area, we meet with an astounding change, and what appears to be\r\na complete and unmistakable break in the line of biological continuity.\r\n\r\nAmong the twelve or fourteen species of _Mammalia_ which are said to have\r\nbeen found in the Purbecks, not one is a member of the orders\r\n_Cheiroptera, Rodentia, Ungulata_, or _Carnivora_, which are so well\r\nrepresented in the Tertiaries. No _Insectivora_ are certainly known, nor\r\nany opossum-like Marsupials. Thus there is a vast negative difference\r\nbetween the Cainozoic and the Mesozoic mammalian faunae of Europe. But\r\nthere is a still more important positive difference, inasmuch as all\r\nthese Mammalia appear to be Marsupials belonging to Australian groups,\r\nand thus appertaining to a different distributional province from the\r\nEocene and Miocene marsupials, which are Austro-Columbian. So far as the\r\nimperfect materials which exist enable a judgment to be formed, the same\r\nlaw appears to have held good for all the earlier Mesozoic _Mammalia_. Of\r\nthe Stonesfield slate mammals, one, _Amphitherium_, has a definitely\r\nAustralian character; one, _Phascolotherium_, may be either Dasyurid or\r\nDidelphine; of a third, _Stereognathus_, nothing can at present be said.\r\nThe two mammals of the Trias, also, appear to belong to Australian\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nEvery one is aware of the many curious points of resemblance between the\r\nmarine fauna of the European Mesozoic rocks and that which now exists in\r\nAustralia. But if there was this Australian facies about both the\r\nterrestrial and the marine faunae of Mesozoic Europe, and if there is this\r\nunaccountable and immense break between the fauna of Mesozoic and that of\r\nTertiary Europe, is it not a very obvious suggestion that, in the\r\nMesozoic epoch, the Australian province included Europe, and that the\r\nArctogaeal province was contained within other limits? The Arctogaeal\r\nprovince is at present enormous, while the Australian is relatively\r\nsmall. Why should not these proportions have been different during the\r\nMesozoic epoch?\r\n\r\nThus I am led to think that by far the simplest and most rational mode of\r\naccounting for the great change which took place in the living\r\ninhabitants of the European area at the end of the Mesozoic epoch, is the\r\nsupposition that it arose from a vast alteration of the physical\r\ngeography of the globe; whereby an area long tenanted by Cainozoic forms\r\nwas brought into such relations with the European area that migration\r\nfrom the one to the other became possible, and took place on a great\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThis supposition relieves us, at once, from the difficulty in which we\r\nwere left, some time ago, by the arguments which I used to demonstrate\r\nthe necessity of the existence of all the great types of the Eocene epoch\r\nin some antecedent period.\r\n\r\nIt is this Mesozoic continent (which may well have lain in the\r\nneighbourhood of what are now the shores of the North Pacific Ocean)\r\nwhich I suppose to have been occupied by the Mesozoic _Monodelphia_; and\r\nit is in this region that I conceive they must have gone through the long\r\nseries of changes by which they were specialised into the forms which we\r\nrefer to different orders. I think it very probable that what is now\r\nSouth America may have received the characteristic elements of its\r\nmammalian fauna during the Mesozoic epoch; and there can be little doubt\r\nthat the general nature of the change which took place at the end of the\r\nMesozoic epoch in Europe was the upheaval of the eastern and northern\r\nregions of the Mesozoic sea-bottom into a westward extension of the\r\nMesozoic continent, over which the mammalian fauna, by which it was\r\nalready peopled, gradually spread. This invasion of the land was prefaced\r\nby a previous invasion of the Cretaceous sea by modern forms of mollusca\r\nand fish.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine how an analogous change might come about in the\r\nexisting world. There is, at present, a great difference between the\r\nfauna of the Polynesian Islands and that of the west coast of America.\r\nThe animals which are leaving their spoils in the deposits now forming in\r\nthese localities are widely different. Hence, if a gradual shifting of\r\nthe deep sea, which at present bars migration between the easternmost of\r\nthese islands and America, took place to the westward, while the American\r\nside of the sea-bottom was gradually upheaved, the palaeontologist of the\r\nfuture would find, over the Pacific area, exactly such a change as I am\r\nsupposing to have occurred in the North-Atlantic area at the close of the\r\nMesozoic period. An Australian fauna would be found underlying an\r\nAmerican fauna, and the transition from the one to the other would be as\r\nabrupt as that between the Chalk and lower Tertiaries; and as the\r\ndrainage-area of the newly formed extension of the American continent\r\ngave rise to rivers and lakes, the mammals mired in their mud would\r\ndiffer from those of like deposits on the Australian side, just as the\r\nEocene mammals differ from those of the Purbecks.\r\n\r\nHow do similar reasonings apply to the other great change of life--that\r\nwhich took place at the end of the Palaeozoic period?\r\n\r\nIn the Triassic epoch, the distribution of the dry land and of\r\nterrestrial vertebrate life appears to have been, generally, similar to\r\nthat which existed in the Mesozoic epoch; so that the Triassic continents\r\nand their faunae seem to be related to the Mesozoic lands and their faunae,\r\njust as those of the Miocene epoch are related to those of the present\r\nday. In fact, as I have recently endeavoured to prove to the Society,\r\nthere was an Arctogaeal continent and an Arctogaeal province of\r\ndistribution in Triassic times as there is now; and the _Sauropsida_ and\r\n_Marsupialia_ which constituted that fauna were, I doubt not, the\r\nprogenitors of the _Sauropsida_ and _Marsupialia_ of the whole Mesozoic\r\nepoch.\r\n\r\nLooking at the present terrestrial fauna of Australia, it appears to me\r\nto be very probable that it is essentially a remnant of the fauna of the\r\nTriassic, or even of an earlier, age[7] in which case Australia must at\r\nthat time have been in continuity with the Arctogaeal continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Since this Address was read, Mr. Krefft has sent us news of\r\nthe discovery in Australia of a freshwater fish of strangely Palaeozoic\r\naspect, and apparently a Ganoid intermediate between _Dipterus_ and\r\n_Lepidosiren_. [The now well-known _Ceratodus_. 1894.]]\r\n\r\nBut now comes the further inquiry, Where was the highly differentiated\r\nSauropsidan fauna of the Trias in Palaeozoic times? The supposition that\r\nthe Dinosaurian, Crocodilian, Dicynodontian, and to Plesiosaurian types\r\nwere suddenly created at the end of the Permian epoch may be dismissed,\r\nwithout further consideration, as a monstrous and unwarranted assumption.\r\nThe supposition that all these types were rapidly differentiated out of\r\n_Lacertilia_ in the time represented by the passage from the Palaeozoic to\r\nthe Mesozoic formation, appears to me to be hardly more credible, to say\r\nnothing of the indications of the existence of Dinosaurian forms in the\r\nPermian rocks which have already been obtained.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I entertain no sort of doubt that the Reptiles, Birds, and\r\nMammals of the Trias are the direct descendants of Reptiles, Birds, and\r\nMammals which existed in the latter part of the Palaeozoic epoch, but not\r\nin any area of the present dry land which has yet been explored by the\r\ngeologist.\r\n\r\nThis may seem a bold assumption, but it will not appear unwarrantable to\r\nthose who reflect upon the very small extent of the earth's surface which\r\nhas hitherto exhibited the remains of the great Mammalian fauna of the\r\nEocene times. In this respect, the Permian land Vertebrate fauna appears\r\nto me to be related to the Triassic much as the Eocene is to the Miocene.\r\nTerrestrial reptiles have been found in Permian rocks only in three\r\nlocalities; in some spots of France, and recently of England, and over a\r\nmore extensive area in Germany. Who can suppose that the few fossils yet\r\nfound in these regions give any sufficient representation of the Permian\r\nfauna?\r\n\r\nIt may be said that the Carboniferous formations demonstrate the\r\nexistence of a vast extent of dry land in the present dry-land area, and\r\nthat the supposed terrestrial Palaeozoic Vertebrate Fauna ought to have\r\nleft its remains in the Coal-measures, especially as there is now reason\r\nto believe that much of the coal was formed by the accumulation of spores\r\nand sporangia on dry land. But if we consider the matter more closely, I\r\nthink that this apparent objection loses its force. It is clear that,\r\nduring the Carboniferous epoch, the vast area of land which is now\r\ncovered by Coal-measures must have been undergoing a gradual depression.\r\nThe dry land thus depressed must, therefore, have existed, as such,\r\nbefore the Carboniferous epoch--in other words, in Devonian times--and\r\nits terrestrial population may never have been other than such as existed\r\nduring the Devonian, or some previous epoch, although much higher forms\r\nmay have been developed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAgain, let me say that I am making no gratuitous assumption of\r\ninconceivable changes. It is clear that the enormous area of Polynesia\r\nis, on the whole, an area over which depression has taken place to an\r\nimmense extent; consequently a great continent, or assemblage of\r\nsubcontinental masses of land must have existed at some former time, and\r\nthat at a recent period, geologically speaking, in the area of the\r\nPacific. But if that continent had contained Mammals, some of them must\r\nhave remained to tell the tale; and as it is well known that these\r\nislands have no indigenous _Mammalia_, it is safe to assume that none\r\nexisted. Thus, midway between Australia and South America, each of which\r\npossesses an abundant and diversified mammalian fauna, a mass of land,\r\nwhich may have been as large as both put together, must have existed\r\nwithout a mammalian inhabitant. Suppose that the shores of this great\r\nland were fringed, as those of tropical Australia are now, with belts of\r\nmangroves, which would extend landwards on the one side, and be buried\r\nbeneath littoral deposits on the other side, as depression went on; and\r\ngreat beds of mangrove lignite might accumulate over the sinking land.\r\nLet upheaval of the whole now take place, in such a manner as to bring\r\nthe emerging land into continuity with the South-American or Australian\r\ncontinent, and, in course of time, it would be peopled by an extension of\r\nthe fauna of one of these two regions--just as I imagine the European\r\nPermian dry land to have been peopled.\r\n\r\nI see nothing whatever against the supposition that distributional\r\nprovinces of terrestrial life existed in the Devonian epoch, inasmuch as\r\nM. Barrande has proved that they existed much earlier. I am aware of no\r\nreason for doubting that, as regards the grades of terrestrial life\r\ncontained in them, one of these may have been related to another as New\r\nZealand is to Australia, or as Australia is to India, at the present day.\r\nAnalogy seems to me to be rather in favour of, than against, the\r\nsupposition that while only Ganoid fishes inhabited the fresh waters of\r\nour Devonian land, _Amphibia_ and _Reptilia_, or even higher forms, may\r\nhave existed, though we have not yet found them. The earliest\r\nCarboniferous _Amphibia_ now known, such as _Anthracosaurus_, are so\r\nhighly specialised that I can by no means conceive that they have been\r\ndeveloped out of piscine forms in the interval between the Devonian and\r\nthe Carboniferous periods, considerable as that is. And I take refuge in\r\none of two alternatives: either they existed in our own area during the\r\nDevonian epoch and we have simply not yet found them; or they formed part\r\nof the population of some other distributional province of that day, and\r\nonly entered our area by migration at the end of the Devonian epoch.\r\nWhether _Reptilia_ and _Mammalia_ existed along with them is to me, at\r\npresent, a perfectly open question, which is just as likely to receive an\r\naffirmative as a negative answer from future inquirers.\r\n\r\nLet me now gather together the threads of my argumentation into the form\r\nof a connected hypothetical view of the manner in which the distribution\r\nof living and extinct animals has been brought about.\r\n\r\nI conceive that distinct provinces of the distribution of terrestrial\r\nlife have existed since the earliest period at which that life is\r\nrecorded, and possibly much earlier; and I suppose, with Mr. Darwin, that\r\nthe progress of modification of terrestrial forms is more rapid in areas\r\nof elevation than in areas of depression. I take it to be certain that\r\nLabyrinthodont _Amphibia_ existed in the distributional province which\r\nincluded the dry land depressed during the Carboniferous epoch; and I\r\nconceive that, in some other distributional provinces of that day, which\r\nremained in the condition of stationary or of increasing dry land, the\r\nvarious types of the terrestrial _Sauropsida_ and of the _Mammalia_ were\r\ngradually developing.\r\n\r\nThe Permian epoch marks the commencement of a new movement of upheaval in\r\nour area, which dry land existed in North America, Europe, Asia, and\r\nAfrica, as it does now. Into this great new continental area the Mammals,\r\nBirds, and Reptiles developed during the Palaeozoic epoch spread, and\r\nformed the great Triassic Arctogaeal province. But, at the end of the\r\nTriassic period, the movement of depression recommenced in our area,\r\nthough it was doubtless balanced by elevation elsewhere; modification and\r\ndevelopment, checked in the one province, went on in that \"elsewhere\";\r\nand the chief forms of Mammals, Birds and Reptiles, as we know them, were\r\nevolved and peopled the Mesozoic continent. I conceive Australia to have\r\nbecome separated from the continent as early as the end of the Triassic\r\nepoch, or not much later. The Mesozoic continent must, I conceive, have\r\nlain to the east, about the shores of the North Pacific and Indian\r\nOceans; and I am inclined to believe that it continued along the eastern\r\nside of the Pacific area to what is now the province of Austro-Columbia,\r\nthe characteristic fauna of which is probably a remnant of the population\r\nof the latter part of this period.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter part of the Mesozoic period the movement of upheaval\r\naround the shores of the Atlantic once more recommenced, and was very\r\nprobably accompanied by a depression around those of the Pacific. The\r\nVertebrate fauna elaborated in the Mesozoic continent moved westward and\r\ntook possession of the new lands, which gradually increased in extent up\r\nto, and in some directions after, the Miocene epoch.\r\n\r\nIt is in favour of this hypothesis, I think, that it is consistent with\r\nthe persistence of a general uniformity in the positions of the great\r\nmasses of land and water. From the Devonian period, or earlier, to the\r\npresent day, the four great oceans, Atlantic, Pacific, Arctic, and\r\nAntarctic, may have occupied their present positions, and only their\r\ncoasts and channels of communication have undergone an incessant\r\nalteration. And, finally, the hypothesis I have put before you requires\r\nno supposition that the rate of change in organic life has been either\r\ngreater or less in ancient times than it is now; nor any assumption,\r\neither physical or biological, which has not its justification in\r\nanalogous phenomena of existing nature.\r\n\r\nI have now only to discharge the last duty of my office, which is to\r\nthank you, not only for the patient attention with which you have\r\nlistened to me so long to-day, but also for the uniform kindness with\r\nwhich, for the past two years, you have rendered my endeavours to perform\r\nthe important, and often laborious, functions of your President a\r\npleasure instead of a burden.",
