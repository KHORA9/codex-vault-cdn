SEELEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following work was announced several years ago in the preface\r\nto the volume on “The Sidereal Heavens;” since which time numerous\r\nenquiries have been made after it by correspondents in England, the\r\nWest Indies, and America. It was nearly ready for publication three\r\nyears ago; but circumstances over which the Author had no controul,\r\nprevented its appearance at that period. This delay, however, has\r\nenabled him to introduce descriptions of certain instruments and\r\ninventions which were partly unknown at the time to which he refers.\r\n\r\nThe title “Practical Astronomer” has been fixed upon, as the shortest\r\nthat could be selected, although the volume does not comprise a variety\r\nof topics and discussions generally comprehended in this department of\r\nastronomy. The work is intended for the information of general readers,\r\nespecially for those who have acquired a relish for astronomical\r\npursuits, and who wish to become acquainted with the instruments by\r\nwhich celestial observations are made, and to apply their mechanical\r\nskill to the construction of some of those which they may wish to\r\npossess. With this view the Author has entered into a variety of minute\r\ndetails, in reference to the construction and practical application\r\nof all kinds of telescopes, &c. which are not to be found in general\r\ntreatises on Optics and Astronomy.\r\n\r\nAs _Light_ is the foundation of astronomical science, and of all the\r\ninstruments used for celestial observation, a brief description is\r\ngiven of the general properties of light--of the laws by which it is\r\nrefracted and reflected when passing through different mediums--and of\r\nthe effects it produces in the system of nature--in order to prepare\r\nthe way for a clear understanding of the principles on which optical\r\ninstruments are constructed, and the effects they produce.\r\n\r\nAs this, as well as every other physical subject, forms a part of the\r\narrangements of the Creator throughout the material system--the Author\r\nhas occasionally taken an opportunity of directing the attention of\r\nthe reader to the Wisdom and Beneficence of the Great First Cause, and\r\nof introducing those moral reflections which naturally flow from the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThe present is the ninth volume which the Author has presented to\r\nthe public, and he indulges the hope that it will meet with the same\r\nfavourable reception which his former publications have uniformly\r\nexperienced. It was originally intended to conclude the volume with a\r\nfew remarks on the _utility_ of astronomical studies, and their _moral_\r\nand _religious_ tendency, but this has been prevented, for the present,\r\nin consequence of the work having swelled to a greater size than was\r\nanticipated. Should he again appear before the public as an author, the\r\nsubject of discussion and illustration will have a more direct bearing\r\nthan the present on the great objects of religion and a future world.\r\n\r\n_Broughty Ferry, near Dundee, August, 1845._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.\r\n\r\n  ON LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n  Necessity of light to the knowledge

It appears to be distributed\r\nthroughout the immensity of the universe, and is essentially requisite\r\nto the enjoyment of every rank of perceptive existence. It is by\r\nthe agency of this mysterious substance, that we become acquainted\r\nwith the beauties and sublimities of the universe, and the wonderful\r\noperations of the Almighty Creator. Without its universal influence,\r\nan impenetrable veil would be thrown over the distant scenes of\r\ncreation; the sun, the moon, the planets, and the starry orbs, would\r\nbe shrouded in the deepest darkness, and the variegated surface of\r\nthe globe on which we dwell, would be almost unnoticed and unknown.\r\nCreation would disappear, a mysterious gloom would surround the mind\r\nof every intelligence, all around would appear a dismal waste, and an\r\nundistinguished chaos. To whatever quarter we might turn, no form nor\r\ncomeliness would be seen, and scarcely a trace of the perfections and\r\nagency of an All Wise and Almighty Being could be perceived throughout\r\nthe universal gloom. In short, without the influence of light, no world\r\ncould be inhabited, no animated being could subsist in the manner it\r\nnow does, no knowledge could be acquired of the works of God, and\r\nhappiness, even in the lowest degree, could scarcely be enjoyed by any\r\norganized intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe have never yet known what it is to live in a world deprived of this\r\ndelightful visitant; for in the darkest night we enjoy a share of its\r\nbeneficial agency, and even in the deepest dungeon its influence is\r\nnot altogether unfelt.[1] The blind, indeed, do not directly enjoy\r\nthe advantages of light, but its influence is reflected upon them,\r\nand their knowledge is promoted through the medium of those who enjoy\r\nthe use of their visual organs. Were all the inhabitants of the world\r\ndeprived of their eye-sight, neither knowledge nor happiness, such as\r\nwe now possess, could possibly be enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing which so strikingly displays the beneficial and\r\nenlivening effects of light, as the dawn of a mild morning after a\r\nnight of darkness and tempest. All appears gloom and desolation, in\r\nour terrestrial abode, till a faint light begins to whiten the eastern\r\nhorizon. Every succeeding moment brings along with it something new\r\nand enlivening. The crescent of light towards the east, now expands its\r\ndimensions and rises upwards towards the cope of heaven; and objects,\r\nwhich a little before were immersed in the deepest gloom, begin to be\r\nclearly distinguished. At length the sun arises, and all nature is\r\nanimated by his appearance; the magnificent scene of creation, which\r\na little before was involved in obscurity, opens gradually to view,\r\nand every object around excites sentiments of wonder, delight, and\r\nadoration. The radiance which emanates from this luminary, displays\r\nbefore us a world strewed with blessings and embellished with the most\r\nbeautiful attire. It unveils the lofty mountains and the forests with\r\nwhich they are crowned--the fruitful fields with the crops that cover\r\nthem--the meadows, with the rivers which water and refresh them--the\r\nplains adorned with verdure, the placid lake and the expansive ocean.\r\nIt removes the curtain of darkness from the abodes of men, and shows us\r\nthe cities, towns and villages, the lofty domes, the glittering spires,\r\nand the palaces and temples with which the landscape is adorned. The\r\nflowers expand their buds and put forth their colours, the birds awake\r\nto melody, man goes forth to his labour, the sounds of human voices are\r\nheard, and all appears life and activity, as if a new world had emerged\r\nfrom the darkness of Chaos.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this splendid scene, which light produces, may be\r\nconsidered as a new creation, no less grand and beneficent than the\r\nfirst creation, when the command was issued, “Let there be light, and\r\nlight was.” The aurora and the rising sun cause the earth and all\r\nthe objects which adorn its surface, to arise out of that profound\r\ndarkness and apparent desolation which deprived us of the view of them,\r\nas if they had been no more. It may be affirmed, in full accordance\r\nwith truth, that the efflux of light in the dawn of the morning, after\r\na dark and cloudy night, is even more magnificent and exhilarating\r\nthan at the first moment of its creation. At that period, there\r\nwere no spectators on earth to admire its glorious effects; and no\r\nobjects, such as we now behold, to be embellished with its radiance.\r\nThe earth was a shapeless chaos, where no beauty or order could be\r\nperceived; the mountains had not reared their heads; the seas were not\r\ncollected into their channels; no rivers rolled through the valleys, no\r\nverdure adorned the plains; the atmosphere was not raised on high to\r\nreflect the radiance, and no animated beings existed to diversify and\r\nenliven the scene. But now, when the dawning of the morning scatters\r\nthe darkness of the night, it opens to view a scene of beauty and\r\nmagnificence. The heavens are adorned with azure, the clouds are tinged\r\nwith the most lively colours, the mountains and plains are clothed with\r\nverdure, and the whole of this lower creation stands forth arrayed with\r\ndiversified scenes of beneficence and grandeur, while the contemplative\r\neye looks round and wonders.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the important and beneficent effects of that _light_\r\nwhich every moment diffuses its blessings around us. It may justly\r\nbe considered as one of the most essential substances connected with\r\nthe system of the material universe, and which gives efficiency to\r\nall the other principles and arrangements of nature. Hence we are\r\ninformed, in the sacred history, that light was the first production\r\nof the Almighty Creator, and the first born of created beings; for\r\nwithout it the universe would have presented nothing but an immense\r\nblank to all sentient existences. Hence, likewise, the Divine Being\r\nis metaphorically represented under the idea of light, as being the\r\nsource of knowledge and felicity to all subordinate intelligences: “God\r\nis _light_, and in Him is no darkness at all;” and he is exhibited as\r\n“dwelling in light unapproachable and full of glory, whom no man hath\r\nseen or can see.” In allusion to these circumstances, Milton, in his\r\nParadise Lost, introduces the following beautiful apostrophe:--\r\n\r\n    ‘Hail holy light! offspring of heaven first born,\r\n    Or of the eternal co-eternal beam!\r\n    May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,\r\n    And never but in unapproached light\r\n    Dwelt from eternity; dwelt then in thee,\r\n    Bright effluence of bright essence increate.\r\n    ----Before the sun\r\n    Before the heavens thou wert, and at the voice\r\n    Of God, as with a mantle, did’st invest\r\n    The rising world of waters dark and deep\r\n    Won from the void and formless infinite.’\r\n\r\nAs light is an element of so much importance and utility in the\r\nsystem of nature, so we find that arrangements have been made for its\r\nuniversal diffusion throughout all the worlds in the universe. The sun\r\nis one of the principal sources of light to this earth on which we\r\ndwell, and to all the other planetary bodies. And, in order that it may\r\nbe _equally_ distributed over every portion of the surfaces of these\r\nglobes, to suit the exigencies of their inhabitants, they are endowed\r\nwith a motion of rotation, by which every part of their surfaces is\r\nalternately turned towards the source of light; and when one hemisphere\r\nis deprived of the direct influence of the solar rays, its inhabitants\r\nderive a portion of light from luminaries in more distant regions, and\r\nhave their views directed to other suns and systems dispersed, in\r\ncountless numbers, throughout the remote spaces of the universe. Around\r\nseveral of the planets, satellites, or moons, have been arranged for\r\nthe purpose of throwing light on their surfaces in the absence of the\r\nsun, while at the same time the primary planets themselves reflect an\r\neffulgence of light upon their satellites. All the stars which our\r\nunassisted vision can discern in the midnight sky, and the millions\r\nmore which the telescope alone enables us to descry, must be considered\r\nas so many fountains of light, not merely to illuminate the voids of\r\nimmensity, but to irradiate with their beams surrounding worlds with\r\nwhich they are more immediately connected, and to diffuse a general\r\nlustre throughout the amplitudes of infinite space. And, therefore,\r\nwe have every reason to believe, that, could we fly, for thousands of\r\nyears, with the swiftness of a seraph, through the spaces of immensity,\r\nwe should never approach a region of absolute darkness, but should find\r\nourselves, every moment encompassed with the emanations of light, and\r\ncheered with its benign influences. That Almighty Being who inhabiteth\r\nimmensity and “dwells in light inaccessible,” evidently appears to\r\nhave diffused light over the remotest spaces of his creation, and to\r\nhave thrown a radiance upon all the provinces of his wide and eternal\r\nempire, so that every intellectual being, wherever existing, may feel\r\nits beneficent effects, and be enabled, through its agency, to trace\r\nhis wonderful operations, and the glorious attributes with which he is\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nAs the science of astronomy depends solely on the influence of light\r\nupon the organ of vision, which is the most noble and extensive of\r\nall our senses; and as the construction of telescopes and other\r\nastronomical instruments is founded upon our knowledge of the\r\nnature of light and the laws by which it operates--it is essentially\r\nrequisite, before proceeding to a description of such instruments, to\r\ntake a cursory view of its nature and properties, in so far as they\r\nhave been ascertained, and the effects it produces when obstructed by\r\ncertain bodies, or when passing through different mediums.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PROPERTIES OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention to discuss the subject of light in minute\r\ndetail--a subject which is of considerable extent, and which would\r\nrequire a separate treatise to illustrate it in all its aspects and\r\nbearings. All that I propose is to offer a few illustrations of\r\nits general properties, and the laws by which it is refracted and\r\nreflected, so as to prepare the way for explaining the nature and\r\nconstruction of telescopes, and other optical instruments.\r\n\r\nThere is no branch of natural science more deserving of our study and\r\ninvestigation than that which relates to light--whether we consider its\r\nbeautiful and extensive effects--the magnificence and grandeur of the\r\nobjects it unfolds to view--the numerous and diversified phenomena it\r\nexhibits--the optical instruments which a knowledge of its properties\r\nhas enabled us to construct--or the daily advantages we derive, as\r\nsocial beings, from its universal diffusion. If air, which serves as\r\nthe medium of sound, and the vehicle of speech, enables us to carry on\r\nan interchange of thought and affection with our fellow-men; how much\r\nmore extensively is that intercourse increased by light, which presents\r\nthe images of our friends and other objects as it were immediately\r\nbefore us, in all their interesting forms and aspects--the speaking\r\neye--the rosy cheeks--the benevolent smile, and the intellectual\r\nforehead! The eye, more susceptible of multifarious impressions than\r\nthe other senses, ‘takes in at once the landscape of the world,’ and\r\nenables us to distinguish, in a moment, the shapes and forms of all\r\nits objects, their relative positions, the colours that adorn them,\r\ntheir diversified aspect, and the motions by which they are transported\r\nfrom one portion of space to another. Light, through the medium of the\r\neye, not only unfolds to us the persons of others, in all their minute\r\nmodifications and peculiarities, but exhibits us to ourselves. It\r\npresents to our own vision a faithful portrait of our peculiar features\r\nbehind reflecting substances, without which property we should remain\r\nentirely ignorant of those traits of countenance which characterize us\r\nin the eyes of others.\r\n\r\nBut, what is the nature of this substance we call _light_, which thus\r\nunfolds to us the scenes of creation? On this subject two leading\r\nopinions have prevailed in the philosophical world. One of those\r\nopinions is, that the whole sphere of the universe is filled with a\r\nsubtle matter, which receives from luminous bodies an agitation which\r\nis incessantly continued, and which, by its vibratory motion, enables\r\nus to perceive luminous bodies. According to this opinion, light may\r\nbe considered as analogous to sound, which is conveyed to the ear by\r\nthe vibratory motions of the air. This was the hypothesis of Descartes,\r\nwhich was adopted, with some modifications, by the celebrated Euler,\r\nHuygens, Franklin, and other philosophers, and has been admitted by\r\nseveral scientific gentlemen of the present day. The other opinion is,\r\nthat light consists of the emission or emanation of the particles of\r\nluminous bodies, thrown out incessantly on all sides, in consequence\r\nof the continued agitation it experiences. This is the hypothesis of\r\nthe illustrious Newton, and has been most generally adopted by British\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\nTo the first hypothesis, it is objected that, if true, ‘light would\r\nnot only spread itself in a direct line, but its motion would be\r\ntransmitted in every direction like that of sound, and would convey\r\nthe impression of luminous bodies in the regions of space beyond the\r\nobstacles that intervene to stop its progress.’ No wall or other opaque\r\nbody could obstruct its course, if it undulated in every direction like\r\nsound; and it would be a necessary consequence, that we should have no\r\nnight, nor any such phenomena as eclipses of the sun or moon, or of\r\nthe satellites of Jupiter and Saturn. This objection has never been\r\nvery satisfactorily answered. On the other hand, Euler brings forward\r\nthe following objections against the Newtonian doctrine of emanation.\r\n1. That, were the sun emitting continually, and in all directions,\r\nsuch floods of luminous matter with a velocity so prodigious, he must\r\nspeedily be exhausted, or at least, some alteration must, after the\r\nlapse of so many ages, be perceptible. 2. That the sun is not the only\r\nbody that emits rays, but that all the stars have the same quality; and\r\nas every where the rays of the sun must be crossing the rays of the\r\nstars, their collision must be violent in the extreme, and that their\r\ndirection must be changed by such a collision.[2]\r\n\r\nTo the first of these objections it is answered--that so vast is the\r\ntenuity of light, that it utterly exceeds the power of conception:\r\nthe most delicate instrument having never been certainly put in\r\nmotion by the impulse of the accumulated sun-beams. It has been\r\ncalculated that in the space of 385,130,000 Egyptian years, (of 360\r\ndays,) the sun would lose only the 1/1,217,420th of his bulk from the\r\ncontinual efflux of his light. And, therefore, if in 385 _millions_ of\r\nyears the sun’s diminution would be so extremely small, it would be\r\naltogether insensible during the comparatively short period of five\r\nor six thousand years. To the second objection it is replied--that\r\nthe particles of light are so extremely rare that their distance from\r\none another is incomparably greater than their diameters--that all\r\nobjections of this kind vanish when we attend to the continuation of\r\nthe impression upon the retina, and to the small number of luminous\r\nparticles which are on that account necessary for producing constant\r\nvision. For it appears, from the accurate experiments of M. D’Arcy,\r\nthat the impression of light upon the retina continues _eight thirds_,\r\nand as a particle of light would move through 26,000 miles in that\r\ntime, constant vision would be maintained by a succession of luminous\r\nparticles twenty-six thousand miles distant from each other.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to decide on the merits of these two hypotheses, I\r\nshall leave the reader to adopt that opinion which he may judge to be\r\nattended with the fewest difficulties, and proceed to illustrate some\r\nof the _properties of light_:--and in the discussion of this subject, I\r\nshall generally adhere to the terms employed by those who have adopted\r\nthe hypothesis of the _emanation_ of light.\r\n\r\n1. _Light emanates or radiates from luminous bodies in a straight\r\nline._ This property is proved by the impossibility of seeing light\r\nthrough bent tubes, or small holes pierced in metallic plates placed\r\none behind another, except the holes be placed in a straight line.\r\nIf we endeavour to look at the sun or a candle through the bore of a\r\nbended pipe, we cannot perceive the object, nor any light proceeding\r\nfrom it, but through a straight pipe the object may be perceived. This\r\nis likewise evident from the form of the rays of light that penetrate\r\na dark room, which proceed straight forward in lines proceeding from\r\nthe luminous body; and from the form of the _shadows_ which bodies\r\nproject, which are bounded by right lines passing from the luminous\r\nbody, and meeting the lines which terminate the interposing body. This\r\nproperty may be demonstrated to the eye, by causing light to pass\r\nthrough small holes into a dark room filled with smoke or dust. It is\r\nto be understood, however, that in this case, the rays of light are\r\nconsidered as passing through the same medium; for when they pass from\r\nair into water, glass, or other media, they are bent at the point where\r\nthey enter a different medium, as we shall afterwards have occasion to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n2. _Light moves with amazing velocity._ The ancients believed\r\nthat it was propagated from the sun and other luminous bodies\r\n_instantaneously_; but the observations of modern astronomers have\r\ndemonstrated that this is an erroneous hypothesis, and that light, like\r\nother projectiles, occupies a certain time in passing from one part of\r\nspace to another. Its velocity, however, is prodigious, and exceeds\r\nthat of any other body with which we are acquainted. It flies across\r\nthe earth’s orbit--a space 190 millions of miles in extent, in the\r\ncourse of sixteen and a half minutes, which is at the rate of 192,000\r\nmiles every second, and more than a million of times swifter than a\r\ncannon ball flying with its greatest velocity. It appears from the\r\ndiscoveries of Dr. Bradley, respecting the aberration of the stars,\r\nthat light flies from those bodies, with a velocity similar, if not\r\nexactly the same; so that the light of the sun, the planets, the stars,\r\nand every luminous body in the universe is propagated with _uniform_\r\nvelocity.[3] But, if the velocity of light be so very great, it may be\r\nasked, how does it not strike against all objects with a force equal\r\nto its velocity? If the finest sand were thrown against our bodies\r\nwith the hundredth part of this velocity, each grain would pierce us\r\nas certainly as the sharpest and swiftest arrows from a bow. It is a\r\nprinciple in mechanics that the force with which all bodies strike,\r\nis in proportion to the size of these bodies, or the quantity of\r\nmatter they contain, multiplied by the velocity with which they move.\r\nTherefore if the particles of light were not almost infinitely small,\r\nthey would, of necessity prove destructive in the highest degree. If a\r\nparticle of light were equal in size to the twelve hundred thousandth\r\npart of a small grain of sand,--supposing light to be material--we\r\nshould be no more able to withstand its force than we should that of\r\nsand shot point blank from the mouth of a cannon. Every object would\r\nbe battered and perforated by such celestial artillery, till our world\r\nwere laid in ruins, and every living being destroyed. And herein\r\nare the wisdom and benevolence of the Creator displayed in making\r\nthe particles of light so extremely small as to render them in some\r\ndegree proportionate to the greatness of the force with which they are\r\nimpelled; otherwise, all nature would have been thrown into ruin and\r\nconfusion, and the great globes of the universe shattered to atoms.\r\n\r\nWe have many proofs, besides the above, that the particles of light are\r\nnext to infinitely small. We find that they penetrate with facility the\r\nhardest substances, such as crystal, glass, various kinds of precious\r\nstones, and even the diamond itself, though among the hardest of\r\nstones; for such bodies could not be transparent, unless light found\r\nan easy passage through their pores. When a candle is lighted in an\r\nelevated situation, in the space of a second or two, it will fill a\r\ncubical space (if there be no interruption) of two miles around it, in\r\nevery direction, with luminous particles, before the least sensible\r\npart of its substance is lost by the candle:--that is, it will in a\r\nshort instant, fill a sphere four miles in diameter, twelve and a half\r\nmiles in circumference, and containing thirty-three and a half cubical\r\nmiles with particles of light; for an eye placed in any part of this\r\ncubical space would perceive the light emitted by the candle. It has\r\nbeen calculated that the number of particles of light contained in\r\nsuch a space cannot be less than _four hundred septillions_--a number\r\nwhich is _six billions_ of times greater than the number of grains of\r\nsand which could be contained in the whole earth considered as a solid\r\nglobe, and supposing each cubic inch of it to contain ten hundred\r\nthousand grains. Such is the inconceivable tenuity of that substance\r\nwhich emanates from all luminous bodies, and which gives beauty and\r\nsplendour to the universe! This may also be evinced by the following\r\nexperiment. Make a small pin-hole in a piece of black paper, and hold\r\nthe paper upright facing a row of candles placed near each other, and\r\nat a little distance behind the black paper, place a piece of white\r\npasteboard. On this pasteboard the rays which flow from all the candles\r\nthrough the small hole in the black paper, will form as many specks\r\nof light as there are candles, each speck being as clear and distinct\r\nas if there were only one speck from a single candle. This experiment\r\nshows that the streams of light from the different candles pass through\r\nthe small hole without confusion, and consequently, that the particles\r\nof light are exceedingly small. For the same reason we can easily see\r\nthrough a small hole not more than 1/100th of an inch in diameter, the\r\nsky, the trees, houses, and nearly all the objects in an extensive\r\nlandscape, occupying nearly an entire hemisphere, the light of all\r\nwhich may pass through this small aperture.\r\n\r\n3. _Light is sent forth in all directions from every visible point\r\nof luminous bodies._ If we hold a sheet of paper before a candle,\r\nor the sun, or any other source of light, we shall find that the\r\npaper is illuminated in whatever position we hold it, provided the\r\nlight is not obstructed by its edge or by any other body. Hence,\r\nwherever a spectator is placed with regard to a luminous body,\r\nevery point of that part of its surface which is toward him will\r\nbe visible, when no intervening object intercepts the passage of\r\nthe light. Hence, likewise, it follows, that the sun illuminates,\r\nnot only an immense plane extending along the paths of the planets,\r\nfrom the one side of the orbit of Uranus to the other, but the whole\r\nof that sphere, or solid space, of which the distance of Uranus\r\nis the radius. The diameter of this sphere is three thousand six\r\nhundred _millions_ of miles, and it, consequently, contains about\r\n24,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000, or twenty-four thousand\r\n_quartillions_ of cubical miles,--every point of which immense space\r\nis filled with the solar beams. Not only so, but the whole cubical\r\nspace which intervenes between the sun and the nearest fixed stars\r\nis more or less illuminated by his rays. For, at the distance of\r\nSirius, or any other of the nearest stars, the sun would be visible,\r\nthough only as a small twinkling orb; and consequently, his rays\r\nmust be diffused, however faint, throughout the most distant spaces\r\nwhence he is visible. The diameter of this immense sphere of light\r\ncannot be less than _forty billions_ of miles, and its solid contents\r\n33,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 or, thirty-three\r\nthousand, five hundred _sextillions_ of cubical miles. All this\r\nimmense, and incomprehensible space is filled with the radiations of\r\nthe solar orb; for were an eye placed in any one point of it, where\r\nno extraneous body interposed, the sun would be visible either as a\r\nlarge luminous orb, or as a small twinkling star. But he can be visible\r\nonly by the rays he emits, and which enter the organs of vision. How\r\ninconceivably immense, then, must be the quantity of rays which are\r\nthrown off in all directions from that luminary which is the source of\r\nour day! Every star must likewise be considered as emitting innumerable\r\nstreams of radiance over a space equally extensive, so that no point in\r\nthe universe can be conceived where absolute darkness prevails, unless\r\nin the _interior_ regions of planetary bodies.\r\n\r\n4. _The effect of light upon the eye is not instantaneous, but\r\ncontinues for a short space of time._ This may be proved and\r\nillustrated by the following examples:--If a stick--or a ball\r\nconnected with a string--be whirled round in a circle, and a certain\r\ndegree of velocity given it, the object will appear to fill the whole\r\ncircle it describes. If a lighted firebrand be whirled round in the\r\nsame rapid manner, a complete circle of light will be exhibited.\r\nThis experiment obviously shows that the impression made on the\r\neye by the light from the ball or the firebrand--when in any given\r\npoint of the circle--is sufficiently lasting to remain till it has\r\ndescribed the whole circle, and again renews its effect, as often as\r\nthe circular motion is continued. The same is proved by the following\r\nconsiderations:--We are continually shutting our eyes, _or winking_;\r\nand, during the time our eyes are shut, on such occasions, we should\r\nlose the view of surrounding objects, if the impression of light did\r\nnot continue a certain time while the eye-lid covers the pupil; but\r\nexperience proves that during such vibrations of the eye-lids, the\r\nlight from surrounding objects is not sensibly intercepted. If we look\r\nfor some time steadily at the light of a candle, and particularly, if\r\nwe look directly at the sun, without any interposing medium, or if we\r\nlook for any considerable time at this luminary, through a telescope\r\nwith a coloured glass interposed--in all these cases, if we shut our\r\neyes immediately after viewing such objects, we shall still perceive a\r\nfaint image of the object, by the impression which its light has made\r\nupon our eyes.\r\n\r\n‘With respect to the _duration_ of the impression of light, it has been\r\nobserved that the teeth of a cog-wheel in a clock were still visible\r\nin succession, when the velocity of rotation brought 246 teeth through\r\na given fixed point in a second. In this case it is clear that if the\r\nimpression made on the eye by the light reflected from any tooth, had\r\nlasted without sensible diminution for the 246th part of a second, the\r\nteeth would have formed one unbroken line, because a new tooth would\r\nhave continually arrived in the place of the interior one before its\r\nimage could have disappeared. If a live coal be whirled round, it is\r\nobserved that the luminous circle is complete, when the rotation is\r\nperformed in the (8-1/2)/60th of a second. In this instance we see\r\nthat the impression was much more durable than the former. Lastly, if\r\nan observer sitting in a room direct his sight through a window, to\r\nany particular object out of doors, for about half a minute, and then\r\nshut his eyes and cover them with his hands, he will still continue to\r\nsee the window, together with the outline of the terrestrial objects\r\nbordering on the sky. This appearance will remain for near a minute,\r\nthough occasionally vanishing and changing colour in a manner that\r\nbrevity forbids our minutely describing. From these facts we are\r\nauthorized to conclude, that all impressions of light on the eye, last\r\na considerable time, that the brightest objects make the most lasting\r\nimpressions; and that, if the object be very bright, or the eye weak,\r\nthe impression may remain for a time so strong, as to mix with and\r\nconfuse the subsequent impressions made by other objects. In the last\r\ncase the eye is said to be _dazzled_ by the light.’[4]\r\n\r\nThe following experiment has likewise been suggested as a proof of the\r\nimpression which light makes upon the eye. If a card, on both sides of\r\nwhich a figure is drawn, for example, a bird and a cage, be made to\r\nrevolve rapidly on the straight line which divides it symmetrically,\r\nthe eye will perceive both figures at the same time, provided they\r\nreturn successively to the same place. M. D’Arcy found by various\r\nexperiments, that, in general, the impression which light produces on\r\nthe eye, lasts about _the eighth of a second_. M. Plateau, of Brussels,\r\nfound that the impression of different colours lasted the following\r\nperiods; the numbers here stated being the decimal parts of a _second_.\r\n_Flame_, 0.242. or nearly one fourth of a second; _Burning coal_,\r\n0.229; _White_, 0.182, or, a little more than one sixth of a second;\r\n_Blue_, 0.186; _Yellow_, 0.173; _Red_, 0.184.\r\n\r\n5. _Light_, though extremely minute, _is supposed to have a certain\r\ndegree of force or momentum_. In order to prove this, the late\r\ningenious Mr. Mitchell contrived the following experiment. He\r\nconstructed a small vane in the form of a common weather-cock, of a\r\n_very thin_ plate of copper, about an inch square, and attached to\r\none of the finest harpsicord wires, about ten inches long, and nicely\r\nbalanced at the other end of the wire, by a grain of very small shot.\r\nThe instrument had also fixed to it in the middle, at right angles to\r\nthe length of the wire, and in an horizontal direction, a small bit\r\nof a very slender sewing needle, about half an inch long, which was\r\nmade magnetical. In this state the whole instrument might weigh about\r\nten grains. The vane was supported in the manner of the needle in the\r\nmariner’s compass, so that it could turn with the greatest ease; and\r\nto prevent its being affected by the vibrations of the air, it was\r\nenclosed in a glass case or box. The rays of the sun were then thrown\r\nupon the broad part of the vane or copper plate, from a concave mirror\r\nof about two feet diameter, which, passing through the front glass of\r\nthe box, were collected into the focus of the mirror upon the copper\r\nplate. In consequence of this the plate began to move with a slow\r\nmotion of about an inch in a second of time, till it had moved through\r\na space of about two inches and a half, when it struck against the\r\nback of the box. The mirror being removed, the instrument returned to\r\nits former situation, and the rays of the sun being again thrown upon\r\nit, it again began to move, and struck against the back of the box as\r\nbefore. This was repeated three or four times with the same success.\r\n\r\nOn the above experiment, the following calculation has been founded:\r\nIf we impute the motion produced in this experiment to the impulse of\r\nthe rays of light, and suppose that the instrument weighed ten grains,\r\nand acquired a velocity of one inch in a second, we shall find that the\r\nquantity of matter contained in the rays falling upon the instrument in\r\nthat time amounted to no more than one twelve hundred-millionth part\r\nof a grain, the velocity of light exceeding the velocity of one inch\r\nin a second in the proportion of about 12,000,000,000 to 1. The light\r\nin this experiment was collected from a surface of about three square\r\nfeet, which reflecting only about half what falls upon it, the quantity\r\nof matter contained in the rays of the sun incident upon a foot and a\r\nhalf of surface in one second of time, ought to be no more than the\r\ntwelve hundred-millionth part of a grain. But the density of the rays\r\nof light at the surface of the sun is greater than that at the earth\r\nin the proportion of 45,000 to 1; there ought therefore to issue from\r\none square foot of the sun’s surface in one second of time, in order to\r\nsupply the waste by light 1/45,000th part of a grain of matter, that\r\nis, a little more than two grains a day, or about 4,752,000 grains, or\r\n670 pounds avoirdupoise, nearly, in 6,000 years, a quantity which would\r\nhave shortened the sun’s diameter no more than about ten feet, if it\r\nwere formed of the density of water only.\r\n\r\nIf the above experiment be considered as having been accurately\r\nperformed, and if the calculations founded upon it be correct, it\r\nappears that there can be no grounds for apprehension that the sun can\r\never be sensibly diminished by the immense and incessant radiations\r\nproceeding from his body on the supposition that light is a material\r\nemanation. For the diameter of the sun is no less than 880,000 miles;\r\nand, before this diameter could be shortened, by the emission of\r\nlight, one English mile, it would require three millions, one hundred\r\nand sixty-eight thousand years, at the rate now stated; and, before\r\nit could be shortened ten miles, it would require a period of above\r\nthirty-one millions of years. And although the sun were thus actually\r\ndiminished, it would produce no sensible effect or derangement\r\nthroughout the planetary system. We have no reason to believe that\r\nthe system, _in its present state and arrangements_, was intended to\r\nendure for ever, and before that luminary could be so far reduced,\r\nduring the revolutions of eternity, as to produce any irregularities\r\nin the system, new arrangements and modifications might be introduced\r\nby the hand of the All Wise and Omnipotent Creator. Besides, it is not\r\nimprobable that a system of means is established by which the sun and\r\nall the luminaries in the universe receive back again a portion of the\r\nlight which they are continually emitting, either from the planets from\r\nwhose surfaces it is reflected, or from the millions of stars whose\r\nrays are continually traversing the immense spaces of creation, or\r\nfrom some other sources to us unknown.\r\n\r\n6. _The intensity of light is diminished in proportion to the square\r\nof the distance from the luminous body._ Thus, a person at two feet\r\ndistance from a candle, has only the fourth part of the light he would\r\nhave at one foot, at three feet distance the ninth part, at four feet\r\nthe sixteenth part, at five feet the twenty fifth part, and so on for\r\nother distances. Hence the light received by the planets of the Solar\r\nsystem decreases in proportion to the squares of the distances of these\r\nbodies from the sun. This may be illustrated by the following figure,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 1._]\r\n\r\nSuppose the light which flows from a point A, and passes through a\r\nsquare hole B, is received upon a plane C, parallel to the plane of the\r\nhole--or, let the figure C be considered as the shadow of the plane B.\r\nWhen the distance of C is double of B, the length and breadth of the\r\nshadow C will be each double of the length and breadth of the plane B,\r\nand treble when AD is treble of AB, and so on, which may be easily\r\nexamined by the light of a candle placed at A. Therefore the surface of\r\nthe shadow C, at the distance AC--double of AB, is divisible into four\r\nsquares, and at a treble distance, into nine squares, severally equal\r\nto the square B, as represented in the figure. The light, then, which\r\nfalls upon the plane B being suffered to pass to double that distance,\r\nwill be uniformly spread over four times the space, and consequently\r\nwill be four times thinner in every part of that space. And at a treble\r\ndistance it will be nine times thinner, and at a quadruple distance\r\nsixteen times thinner than it was at first. Consequently the quantities\r\nof this rarified light received upon a surface of any given size and\r\nshape when removed successively to these several distances, will be but\r\none-fourth, one-ninth, one-sixteenth, of the whole quantity received by\r\nit at the first distance AB.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with this law, the relative quantities of light on the\r\nsurfaces of the planets may be easily determined, when their distances\r\nfrom the sun are known. Thus, the distance of Uranus from the sun is\r\n1,800,000,000 miles, which is about nineteen times greater than the\r\ndistance of the earth from the same luminary. The square of 19 is 361;\r\nconsequently the earth enjoys 361 times the intensity of light when\r\ncompared with that of Uranus; in other words, this distant planet\r\nenjoys only the 1/361 part of the quantity of light which falls upon\r\nthe earth. This quantity, however, is equivalent to the light we should\r\nenjoy from the combined effulgence of 348 full moons; and if the\r\npupils of the eyes of the inhabitants of this planet be much larger\r\nthan ours, and the _retina_ of the eye be endued with a much greater\r\ndegree of nervous sensibility, they may perceive objects with as great\r\na degree of splendour as we perceive on the objects which surround\r\nus in this world. Following out the same principle, we find that the\r\nquantity of light enjoyed by the planet Mercury is nearly _seven_ times\r\ngreater than that of the Earth, and that of Venus nearly _double_ of\r\nwhat we enjoy--that Mars has less than the one half--Jupiter the _one\r\ntwenty-seventh_ part--and Saturn only the _one ninetieth_ part of the\r\nlight which falls upon the Earth. That the light of these distant\r\nplanets, however, is not so weak as we might at first imagine appears\r\nfrom the brilliancy they exhibit, when viewed in our nocturnal sky,\r\neither with the telescope or with the unassisted eye--and likewise from\r\nthe circumstance that a very small portion of the Sun--such as the one\r\nfortieth or one fiftieth part diffuses a quantity of light sufficient\r\nfor most of the purposes of life, as is found in the case of total\r\neclipses of the Sun, when his western limb begins to be visible, only\r\nlike a fine luminous thread, for his light is then sufficient to render\r\ndistinctly visible all the parts of the surrounding landscape.\r\n\r\n7. _It is by light reflected from opake bodies that most of the objects\r\naround us are rendered visible._ When a lighted candle is brought\r\ninto a dark room, not only the candle but all other bodies in the\r\nroom become visible. Rays of the sun passing into a dark room render\r\nluminous a sheet of paper on which they fall, and this sheet in its\r\nturn enlightens, to a certain extent, the whole apartment, and renders\r\nobjects in it visible, so long as it receives the rays of the sun. In\r\nlike manner, the moon and the planets are opake bodies, but the light\r\nof the sun falling upon them, and being reflected from their surfaces,\r\nrenders them visible. Were no light to fall on them from the sun, or\r\nwere they not endued with a power of reflecting it, they would be\r\naltogether invisible to our sight. When the moon comes between us and\r\nthe sun, as in a total eclipse of that luminary, as no solar light is\r\nreflected from the surface next the earth, she is invisible--only the\r\ncurve or outline of her figure being distinguished by her shadow. In\r\nthis case, however, there is a certain portion of reflected light on\r\nthe lunar hemisphere next the earth, though not distinguishable during\r\na solar eclipse. The earth is enlightened by the sun, and a portion of\r\nthe rays which fall upon it is reflected upon the dark hemisphere of\r\nthe moon which is then towards the earth. This reflected light from the\r\nearth is distinctly perceptible, when the moon appears as a slender\r\ncrescent, two or three days after new moon--when the earth reflects its\r\nlight back on the moon, in the same manner as the full moon reflects\r\nher light on the earth. Hence, even at this period of the moon, her\r\nwhole face becomes visible to us, but its light is not uniform or of\r\nequal intensity. The thin crescent on which the full blaze of the solar\r\nlight falls, is very brilliant and distinctly seen, while the other\r\npart, on which falls only a comparatively feeble light from the earth,\r\nappears very faint, and is little more than visible to the naked eye,\r\nbut with a telescope of moderate power,--if the atmosphere be very\r\nclear--it appears beautifully distinct, so that the relative positions\r\nof many of the lunar spots may be distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of reflected light is very small, when compared with\r\nthat which proceeds directly from luminous bodies. M. Bouguer, a\r\nFrench philosopher, who made a variety of experiments to ascertain the\r\nproportion of light emitted by the heavenly bodies, concluded from\r\nthese experiments, that the light transmitted from the sun to the\r\nearth is at least 300,000 times as great as that which descends to us\r\nfrom the full moon--and that, of 300,000 rays which the moon receives,\r\nfrom 170,000 to 200,000 are absorbed. Hence we find that, however\r\nbrilliant the moon may appear at night--in the day time she appears as\r\nobscure as a small portion of dusky cloud to which she happens to be\r\nadjacent, and reflects no more light than a portion of whitish cloud of\r\nthe same size. And as the full moon fills only the ninety thousandth\r\npart of the sky, it would require at least ninety thousand moons to\r\nproduce as much light as we enjoy in the day-time under a cloudy sky.\r\n\r\nAs the moon and the planets are rendered visible to us only by light\r\nreflected from their surfaces, so it is in the same way that the images\r\nof most of the objects around us are conveyed to our organs of vision.\r\nWe behold all the objects which compose an extensive landscape,--the\r\nhills and vales, the woods and lawns, the lakes and rivers, and the\r\nhabitations of man--in consequence of the capacity with which they\r\nare endued of sending forth reflected rays to the eye, from every\r\npoint of their surfaces and in all directions. In connection with the\r\nreflection of light, the following curious observation may be stated.\r\nBaron Funk, visiting some silver mines in Sweden, observed, that,\r\n‘in a clear day, it was as dark as pitch underground in the eye of a\r\npit, at sixty or seventy fathoms deep; whereas, in a cloudy or rainy\r\nday, he could see to read even at 106 fathoms deep. Enquiring of the\r\nminers, he was informed that this is always the case; and reflecting\r\nupon it, he imagined it arose from this circumstance, that when the\r\natmosphere is full of clouds, light is reflected from them into the\r\npit in all directions, and that thereby a considerable proportion of\r\nthe rays are reflected perpendicularly upon the earth: whereas when the\r\natmosphere is clear, there are no opaque bodies to reflect the light in\r\nthis manner, at least in a sufficient quantity; and rays from the sun\r\nhimself can never fall perpendicularly in that country.’--The reason\r\nhere assigned is, in all probability, the true cause of the phenomenon\r\nnow described.\r\n\r\n8. It is supposed by some philosophers that _light is subject to the\r\nsame laws of attraction that govern all other material substances_--and\r\nthat _it is imbibed and forms a constituent part of certain bodies_.\r\nThis has been inferred from the phenomena of the _Bolognian stone_, and\r\nwhat are generally called the _solar phosphori_. The Bolognian stone\r\nwas first discovered about the year 1680, by Leascariolo, a shoe-maker\r\nof Bologna. Having collected together some stones of a shining\r\nappearance at the bottom of Monte Paterno, and being in quest of some\r\nalchemical secret, he put them into a crucible to calcine them--that\r\nis, to reduce them to the state of cinders. Having taken them out of\r\nthe crucible, and exposed them to the light of the sun, he afterwards\r\nhappened to carry them into a dark place, when to his surprise, he\r\nobserved that they possessed a self-illuminating power, and continued\r\nto emit faint rays of light for some hours afterwards. In consequence\r\nof this discovery, the Bolognian spar came into considerable demand\r\namong natural philosophers and the curious in general; and the best\r\nway of preparing it seems to have been hit upon by the family of\r\nZagoni, who supplied all Europe with Bolognian phosphorus, till the\r\ndiscovery of more powerful phosphoric substances put an end to their\r\nmonopoly.--In the year 1677, Baldwin, a native of Misnia, observed\r\nthat chalk dissolved in aqua-fortis exactly resembled the Bolognian\r\nstone in its property of imbibing light, and emitting it after it was\r\nbrought into the dark ; and hence it has obtained the name of Baldwin’s\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nIn 1730 M. du Fay directed his attention to this subject, and observed\r\nthat all earthy substances susceptible of calcination, either by\r\nmere fire, or when assisted by the previous action of nitrous acid,\r\npossessed the property of becoming more or less luminous, when calcined\r\nand exposed for a short time in the light--that the most perfect of\r\nthese phosphori were limestones, and other kinds of carbonated lime,\r\ngypsum, and particularly the topaz, and that some diamonds were also\r\nobserved to be luminous by simple exposure to the sun’s rays. Sometime\r\nafterwards, Beccaria discovered that a great variety of other bodies\r\nwere convertible into phosphori by exposure to the mere light of the\r\nsun, such as, organic animal remains, most compound salts, nitre and\r\nborax--all the farinaceous and oily seeds of vegetable substances,\r\nall the gums and several of the resins--the white woods and vegetable\r\nfibre, either in the form of paper or linen; also starch and loaf-sugar\r\nproved to be good phosphori, after being made thoroughly dry, and\r\nexposed to the direct rays of the sun. Certain animal substances by\r\na similar treatment were also converted into phosphori; particularly\r\nbone, sinew, glue, hair, horn, hoof, feathers, and fish-shells. The\r\nsame property was communicated to rock crystal and some other of\r\nthe gems, by rubbing them against each other so as to roughen their\r\nsurfaces, and then placing them for some minutes in the focus of a\r\nlens, by which the rays of light were concentrated upon them, at the\r\nsame time that they were also moderately heated.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1768 Mr. Canton contributed some important facts in\r\nrelation to solar phosphori, and communicated a method of preparing\r\na very powerful one, which, after the inventor, is usually called\r\n_Canton’s phosphorus_. He affirms that his phosphorus, enclosed in a\r\nglass flask, and hermetically sealed, retains its property of becoming\r\nluminous for at least four years, without any apparent decrease of\r\nactivity. It has also been found that, if a common box smoothing-iron,\r\nheated in the usual manner, be placed for half a minute on a sheet\r\nof dry, white paper, and the paper be then exposed to the light, and\r\nafterwards examined in a dark closet, it will be found that the whole\r\npaper will be luminous, that part, however, on which the iron had stood\r\nbeing much more shining than the rest.\r\n\r\nFrom the above facts it would seem that certain bodies have the power\r\nof imbibing light and again emitting it, in certain circumstances,\r\nand that this power may remain for a considerable length of time. It\r\nis observed that the light which such bodies emit bears an analogy to\r\nthat which they have imbibed. In general, the illuminated phosphorus is\r\nreddish; but when a weak light only has been admitted to it, or when\r\nit has been received through pieces of white paper, the emitted light\r\nis pale or whitish.--Mr. Morgan, in the seventy-fifth volume of the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, treats the subject of light at considerable\r\nlength; and as a foundation for his reasoning, he assumes the following\r\ndata:--1. That light is a body, and like all others, subject to the\r\nlaws of attraction. 2. That light is a heterogeneous body; and that\r\nthe same attractive power operates with different degrees of force\r\non its different parts. To the principle of attraction, likewise,\r\nSir Isaac Newton has referred the most extraordinary phenomena of\r\nlight, Refraction and Inflection. He has also endeavoured to show that\r\nlight is not only subject to the law of attraction but of repulsion\r\nalso, since it is repelled or reflected from certain bodies. If\r\nsuch principles be admitted, then, it is highly probable that the\r\nphosphorescent bodies to which we have adverted have a power of\r\nattracting or imbibing the substance of light, and of retaining or\r\ngiving it out under certain circumstances, and that the matter of light\r\nis incorporated at least with the surface of such bodies. But on this\r\nsubject, as on many others, there is a difference of opinion among\r\nphilosophers.[5]\r\n\r\n9. _Light is found to produce a remarkable effect on Plants and\r\nFlowers, and other vegetable productions._ Of all the phenomena which\r\nliving vegetables exhibit there are few that appear more extraordinary\r\nthan the energy and constancy with which their stems incline toward the\r\nlight. Most of the discous flowers follow the sun in his course. They\r\nattend him to his evening retreat, and meet his rising lustre in the\r\nmorning with the same unerring law. They unfold their flowers on the\r\napproach of this luminary; they follow his course by turning on their\r\nstems, and close them as soon as he disappears. If a plant, also, is\r\nshut up in a dark room, and a small hole afterwards opened by which the\r\nlight of the sun may enter, the plant will turn towards that hole, and\r\neven alter its own shape in order to get near it; so that though it\r\nwas straight before, it will in time become crooked, that it may get\r\nnear the light. Vegetables placed in rooms where they receive light\r\nonly in one direction, always extend themselves in that direction. If\r\nthey receive light in two directions, they direct their course towards\r\nthat which is strongest. It is not the _heat_ but the _light_ of the\r\nsun which the plant thus covets; for, though a fire be kept in the\r\nroom, capable of giving a much stronger heat than the sun, the plant\r\nwill turn away from the fire in order to enjoy the solar light. Trees\r\ngrowing in thick forests, where they only receive light from above,\r\ndirect their shoots almost invariably upwards, and therefore become\r\nmuch taller and less spreading than such as stand single.\r\n\r\nThe _green_ colour of plants is likewise found to depend on the sun’s\r\nlight being allowed to shine on them; for without the influence of\r\nthe solar light, they are always of a _white_ colour. It is found by\r\nexperiment that, if a plant which has been reared in darkness be\r\nexposed to the light of day, in two or three days it will acquire a\r\ngreen colour perceptibly similar to that of plants which have grown\r\nin open day-light. If we expose to the light one part of the plant,\r\nwhether leaf or branch, this part alone will become green. If we cover\r\nany part of a leaf with an opake substance, this place will remain\r\nwhite, while the rest becomes green. The whiteness of the inner leaves\r\nof cabbages is a partial effect of the same cause, and many other\r\nexamples of the same kind might easily be produced. M. Decandolle,\r\nwho seems to have paid particular attention to this subject, has the\r\nfollowing remarks: ‘It is certain, that between the white state of\r\nplants vegetating in darkness, and complete verdure, every possible\r\nintermediate degree exists, determined by the intensity of the light.\r\nOf this any one may easily satisfy himself by attending to the colour\r\nof a plant exposed to the full day-light; it exhibits in succession\r\nall the degrees of verdure. I had already seen the same phenomenon,\r\nin a particular manner, by exposing plants reared in darkness to the\r\nlight of lamps. In these experiments, I not only saw the colour come on\r\ngradually, according to the continuance of the exposure to light; but\r\nI satisfied myself, that a certain intensity of permanent light never\r\ngives to a plant more than a certain degree of colour. The same fact\r\nreadily shows itself in nature, when we examine the plants that grow\r\nunder shelter or in forests, or when we examine in succession the state\r\nof the leaves that form the heads of cabbages.’[6]\r\n\r\nIt is likewise found that the _perspiration_ of vegetables is increased\r\nor diminished, in a certain measure by the degree of _light_ which\r\nfalls upon them. The experiments of Mr. P. Miller and others, prove\r\nthat plants uniformly perspire most in the forenoon, though the\r\ntemperature of the air in which they are placed should be unvaried.\r\nM. Guettard likewise informs us that a plant exposed to the rays of\r\nthe sun, has its perspiration increased to a much greater degree than\r\nif it had been exposed to the same heat under the shade. Vegetables\r\nare likewise found to be indebted to light for their smell, taste,\r\ncombustibility, maturity, and the resinous principle, which equally\r\ndepend upon this fluid. The aromatic substances, resins, and volatile\r\noil are the productions of southern climates, where the light is more\r\npure, constant, and intense. In fine, another remarkable property of\r\nlight on the vegetable kingdom is that, when vegetables are exposed to\r\nopen day-light, or to the sun’s rays, they emit oxygen gas or vital\r\nair. It has been proved that, in the production of this effect, the\r\nsun does not act as a body that heats. The emission of the gas is\r\ndetermined by the light: pure air is therefore separated by the action\r\nof light, and the operation is stronger as the light is more vivid.\r\nBy this continual emission of vital air, the Almighty incessantly\r\npurifies the atmosphere, and repairs the loss of pure air occasioned by\r\nrespiration, combustion, fermentation, putrefaction, and numerous other\r\nprocesses which have a tendency to contaminate this fluid so essential\r\nto the vigor and comfort of animal life; so that, in this way, by the\r\nagency of light, a due equilibrium is always maintained between the\r\nconstituent parts of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject the following curious phenomenon may\r\nbe stated, as related by M. Haggern, a Lecturer on Natural History in\r\nSweden. One evening he perceived a faint flash of light repeatedly\r\ndart from a marigold. Surprised at such an uncommon appearance, he\r\nresolved to examine it with attention; and, to be assured it was no\r\ndeception of the eye, he placed a man near him, with orders to make\r\na signal at the moment when he observed the light. They both saw\r\nit constantly at the same moment. The light was most brilliant on\r\nmarigolds of an orange or flame colour, but scarcely visible on pale\r\nones. The flash was frequently seen on the same flower two or three\r\ntimes in quick succession; but more commonly at intervals of several\r\nminutes; and when several flowers in the same place emitted their\r\nlight together, it could be observed at a considerable distance. The\r\nphenomenon was remarked in the months of July and August at sun-set,\r\nand for half an hour when the atmosphere was clear; but after a\r\nrainy day, or when the air was loaded with vapours, nothing of it\r\nwas seen. The following flowers emitted flashes more or less vivid,\r\nin this order:--1. The Marigold, 2. Monk’s hood, 3. The Orange Lily,\r\n4. The Indian Pink. As to the _cause_ of this phenomenon, different\r\nopinions may be entertained. From the rapidity of the flash and other\r\ncircumstances, it may be conjectured that electricity is concerned in\r\nproducing this appearance. M. Haggern, after having observed the flash\r\nfrom the orange lily, the antheræ of which are at considerable distance\r\nfrom the petals, found that the light proceeded from the petals only;\r\nwhence he concludes, that this electrical light is caused by the pollen\r\nwhich, in flying off, is scattered on the petals. But, perhaps, the\r\ntrue cause of it still remains to be ascertained.\r\n\r\n10. _Light has been supposed to produce a certain degree of influence\r\non the_ PROPAGATION OF SOUND?--M. Parolette, in a long\r\npaper in the ‘Journal de Physique,’ vol. 68, which is copied into\r\n‘Nicholson’s Philosophical Journal,’ vol. 25, pp. 28-39,--has offered\r\na variety of remarks, and detailed a number of experiments on this\r\nsubject. The author states the following circumstances as having\r\nsuggested the connection between light and sound. ‘In 1803, I lived\r\nin Paris, and being accustomed to rise before day to finish a work on\r\nwhich I had long been employed, I found myself frequently disturbed\r\nby the sound of carriages, as my windows looked into one of the most\r\nfrequented streets in that city. This circumstance which disturbed me\r\nin my studies every morning, led me to remark, that the appearance of\r\nday-break peculiarly affected the propagation of the sound: from dull\r\nand deep, which it was before day, it seemed to me to acquire a more\r\nsonorous sharpness in the period that succeeded the dissipation of\r\ndarkness. The rolling of the wheels seemed to announce the friction\r\nof some substances grown more elastic; and my ear on attending to it\r\nperceived this difference diminish, in proportion as the sound of\r\nwheels was confounded with those excited by the tumult of objects\r\nquitting their nocturnal silence. Struck with this observation, I\r\nattempted to discover whether any particular causes had deceived my\r\nears. I rose several times before day for this purpose alone, and was\r\nevery time confirmed in my suspicion, that light must have a peculiar\r\ninfluence on the propagation of sound. This variation, however, in\r\nthe manner in which the air gave sounds might be the effect of the\r\nagitation of the atmosphere produced by the rarefaction the presence\r\nof the sun occasioned; but the situation of my windows, and the usual\r\ndirection of the morning breeze, militated against this argument.’\r\n\r\nThe author then proceeds to give a description of a very delicate\r\ninstrument, and various apparatus for measuring the propagation and\r\nintensity of sound, and the various experiments both in the dark, and\r\nin day-light, and likewise under different changes of the atmosphere,\r\nwhich were made with his apparatus--all of which tended to prove\r\nthat light had a sensible influence in the propagation of sound. But\r\nthe detail of these experiments and their several results would be\r\ntoo tedious to be here transcribed.--The night has generally been\r\nconsidered as more favourable than the day for the transmission of\r\nsound. ‘That this is the case (says Parolette) with respect to our ears\r\ncannot be doubted; but this argues nothing against my opinion. We hear\r\nfurther by night on account of the silence, and this always contributes\r\nto it, while the noise of a wind favourable to the propagation of a\r\nsound, may prevent the sound from being heard.’ In reference to the\r\ncause which produces the effect now stated, he proposes the following\r\nqueries. ‘Is the atmospheric air more dense on the appearance of light\r\nthan in darkness? Is this greater density of the air or of the elastic\r\nfluid that is subservient to the propagation of sound, the effect of\r\naeriform substances kept in this state through the medium of light?’\r\nHe is disposed, on the whole, to conclude, that the effect in question\r\nis owing to the action of light upon the oxygen of the atmosphere,\r\nsince oxygen gas is found by experiment to be best adapted to the\r\ntransmission of sound.\r\n\r\nOur author concludes his communication with the following\r\nremarks:--‘Light has a velocity 900,000 times as rapid as that of\r\nsound. Whether it emanate from the sun and reach to our earth, or\r\nact by means of vibrations agitating the particles of a fluid of a\r\npeculiar nature--the particles of this fluid must be extremely light,\r\nelastic and active. Nor does it appear to me unreasonable, to ascribe\r\nto the mechanical action of these particles set in motion by the sun,\r\nthe effects its presence occasions in the vibrations that proceed from\r\nsonorous bodies. The more deeply we investigate the theory of light,\r\nthe more we must perceive, that the powers by which the universe is\r\nmoved reside in the imperceptible particles of bodies; and that the\r\ngrand results of nature are but an assemblage of an order of actions\r\nthat take place in its infinitely small parts; consequently, we cannot\r\ninstitute a series of experiments more interesting than those which\r\ntend to develope the properties of light. Our organs of sense are so\r\nimmediately connected with the fluid that enlightens us, that the\r\nnotion of having acquired an idea of the mode of action of this fluid\r\npresents itself to our minds, as the hope of a striking advance in\r\nthe knowledge of what composes the organic mechanism of our life, and\r\nof that of beings which closely follow the rank assigned to the human\r\nspecies.’\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief description of some of the leading properties of light.\r\nOf all the objects that present themselves to the philosophic and\r\ncontemplative mind, light is one of the noblest and most interesting.\r\nThe action it exerts on all the combinations of matter, its extreme\r\ndivisibility, the rapidity of its propagation, the sublime wonders it\r\nreveals, and the office it performs in what constitutes the life of\r\norganic beings, lead us to consider it as a substance acting the first\r\npart in the economy of nature. The magic power which this emanation\r\nfrom the heavens exerts on our organs of vision, in exhibiting to our\r\nview the sublime spectacle of the universe, cannot be sufficiently\r\nadmired. Nor is its power confined to the organs of sight; all our\r\nsenses are, in a greater or less degree, subjected to the action of\r\nlight, and all the objects in this lower creation--whether in the\r\nanimal, the vegetable, or the mineral kingdoms--are, to a certain\r\nextent, susceptible of its influence. Our globe appears to be little\r\nmore than an accumulation of terrestrial materials introduced into the\r\nboundless ocean of the _solar light_, as a theatre on which it may\r\ndisplay its exhaustless power and energy, and give animation, beauty\r\nand sublimity to every surrounding scene--and to regulate all the\r\npowers of nature, and render them subservient to the purposes for which\r\nthey were ordained. This elementary substance appears to be universal\r\nin its movements, and in its influence. It descends to us from the\r\nsolar orb. It wings its way through the voids of space, along a course\r\nof ninety-five millions of miles, till it arrives at the outskirts of\r\nour globe; it passes freely through the surrounding atmosphere, it\r\nstrikes upon the clouds and is reflected by them; it irradiates the\r\nmountains, the vales, the forests, the rivers, the seas, and all the\r\nproductions of the vegetable kingdom, and adorns them with a countless\r\nassemblage of colours. It scatters and disperses its rays from one end\r\nof creation to another, diffusing itself throughout every sphere of the\r\nuniverse. It flies without intermission from star to star, and from\r\nsuns to planets, throughout the boundless sphere of immensity, forming\r\na connecting chain and a medium of communication among all the worlds\r\nand beings within the wide empire of Omnipotence.\r\n\r\nWhen the sun is said “to rule over the day,” it is intimated that he\r\nacts as the vicegerent of the Almighty, who has invested him with a\r\nmechanical power of giving light, life and motion to all the beings\r\nsusceptible of receiving impressions from his radiance. As the servant\r\nof his creator he distributes blessings without number among all the\r\ntribes of sentient and intelligent existence. When his rays illumine\r\nthe eastern sky in the morning, all nature is enlivened with his\r\npresence. When he sinks beneath the western horizon, the flowers droop,\r\nthe birds retire to their nests, and a mantle of darkness is spread\r\nover the landscape of the world. When he approaches the equinox in\r\nspring, the animal and vegetable tribes revive, and nature puts on a\r\nnew and a smiling aspect. When he declines towards the winter solstice,\r\ndreariness and desolation ensue, and a temporary death takes place\r\namong the tribes of the vegetable world.--This splendid luminary,\r\nwhose light embellishes the whole of this lower creation, forms the\r\nmost lively representation of Him who is the source and the centre of\r\nall beauty and perfection. “God is a sun,” the sun of the moral and\r\nspiritual universe, from whom all the emanations of knowledge, love and\r\nfelicity descend. “He covereth himself with light as with a garment.”\r\nand “dwells in light inaccessible and full of glory.” The felicity\r\nand enjoyments of the future world are adumbrated under the ideas of\r\n_light_ and _glory_. “The glory of God enlightens the celestial city,”\r\nits inhabitants are represented as “the saints _in light_,” it is\r\ndeclared that “their _sun_ shall no more go down,” and that “the Lord\r\nGod is their _everlasting light_.” So that light not only cheers and\r\nenlivens all beings throughout the material creation, but is the emblem\r\nof the Eternal Mind, and of all that is delightful and transporting in\r\nthe scenes of a blessed immortality.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of light, and the beneficent effects it produces,\r\nthe wisdom and goodness of the Almighty are conspicuously displayed.\r\nWithout the beams of the sun and the influence of light, what were all\r\nthe realms of this world, but an undistinguished chaos and so many\r\ndungeons of darkness? In vain should we roll our eyes around to behold,\r\namidst the universal gloom, the flowery fields, the verdant plains, the\r\nflowing streams, the expansive ocean, the moon walking in brightness,\r\nthe planets in their courses, or the innumerable host of stars. All\r\nwould be lost to the eye of man, and the “blackness of darkness” would\r\nsurround him for ever. And with how much wisdom has every thing been\r\narranged in relation to the motion and minuteness of light? Were it\r\ncapable of being transformed into a solid substance, and retain its\r\npresent velocity, it would form the most dreadful and appalling element\r\nin nature, and produce universal terror and destruction throughout the\r\nuniverse. That this is not impossible, and could easily be effected by\r\nthe hand of Omnipotence, appears from such substances as _phosphorus_,\r\nwhere light is supposed to be concentrated in a solid state. But in all\r\nits operations and effects, as it is now directed by unerring wisdom\r\nand beneficence, it exhibits itself as the most benign and delightful\r\nelement connected with the constitution of the material system,\r\ndiffusing splendour and felicity wherever its influence extends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nRefraction is the turning or bending of the rays of light out of their\r\nnatural course.\r\n\r\nLight, when proceeding from a luminous body--without being reflected\r\nfrom any opake substance or inflected by passing near one--is\r\ninvariably found to proceed in straight lines without the least\r\ndeviation. But if it happens to pass obliquely from one medium to\r\nanother, it always leaves the direction it had before and assumes a\r\nnew one. This change of direction, or _bending_ of the rays of light,\r\nis what is called _Refraction_--a term which probably had its origin\r\nfrom the broken appearance which a staff or a long pole exhibits, when\r\na portion of it is immersed in water--the word, derived from the Latin\r\n_frango_, literally signifying _breaking_ or bending.\r\n\r\nWhen light is thus refracted, or has taken a new direction, it then\r\nproceeds invariably in a straight line till it meets with a different\r\nmedium,[7] when it is again turned out of its course. It must be\r\nobserved, however, that though we may by this means cause the rays of\r\nlight to make any number of angles in their course, it is impossible\r\nfor us to make them describe a curve, except in one single case,\r\nnamely, where they pass through a medium, the density of which either\r\nuniformly increases or diminishes. This is the case with the light of\r\nthe celestial bodies, which passes downwards through our atmosphere,\r\nand likewise with that which is reflected upwards through it by\r\nterrestrial objects. In both these cases it describes a curve of the\r\nhyperbolic kind; but at all other times, it proceeds in straight lines,\r\nor in what may be taken for straight lines without any sensible error.\r\n\r\nThere are two circumstances essential to refraction. 1. That the rays\r\nof light shall pass out of one medium into another of a different\r\ndensity, or of a greater or less degree of resistance. 2. That they\r\npass in an _oblique_ direction. The denser the refracting medium, or\r\nthat into which the ray enters, the greater will be its refracting\r\npower; and of two refracting mediums of the same density, that which\r\nis of an oily or inflammable nature will have a greater refracting\r\npower than the other. The nature of refraction may be more particularly\r\nexplained and illustrated by the following figure and description.\r\n\r\nLet ADHI fig. 2, be a body of water, AD its surface, C a point in which\r\na ray of light BC enters from the air into the water. This ray, by the\r\ngreater density of the water, instead of passing straight forward in\r\nits first direction to K, will be bent at the point C, and pass along\r\nin the direction CE, which is called the _refracted_ ray. Let the line\r\nFG be drawn perpendicular to the surface of the water in C, then it\r\nis evident that the ray BC, in passing out of air, a _rare_ medium,\r\ninto a _dense_ medium, as water, is refracted into a ray CE which is\r\n_nearer_ to the perpendicular CG than the incident ray BC, and on the\r\ncontrary, the ray EC passing out of a denser medium into a rarer will\r\nbe refracted into CB, which is _farther_ from the perpendicular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 2._]\r\n\r\nThe same thing may be otherwise illustrated as follows:--suppose a hole\r\nmade in one of the sides of the vessel as at _a_, and a lighted candle\r\nplaced within two or three feet of it, when empty, so that its flame\r\nmay be at L, a ray of light proceeding from it will pass through the\r\nhole _a_ in a straight line LBCK till it reach the bottom of the vessel\r\nat K, where it will form a small circle of light. Having put a mark at\r\nthe point K, pour water into the vessel till it rise to the height AD,\r\nand the round spot that was formerly at K, will appear at E; that is,\r\nthe ray which went straight forward, when the vessel was empty, to K,\r\nhas been bent at the point C, where it falls into the the water, into\r\nthe line CE. In this experiment it is necessary that the front of the\r\nvessel should be of glass, in order that the course of the ray may be\r\nseen; and if a little soap be mixed with the water so as to give it a\r\nlittle mistiness, the ray CE will be distinctly perceived. If, in place\r\nof fresh water we pour in salt water, it will be found that the ray BC\r\nis more bent at C. In like manner alcohol will refract the ray BC more\r\nthan salt water, and oil more than alcohol, and a piece of solid glass,\r\nof the shape of the water, would refract the light still more than the\r\noil.\r\n\r\nThe angle of refraction depends on the obliquity of the rays falling on\r\nthe refracting surface being always such, that the sine of the incident\r\nangle is to the sine of the refracted angle, in a given proportion. The\r\n_incident_ angle is the angle made by a ray of light and a line drawn\r\nperpendicular to the refracting surface, at the point where the light\r\nenters the surface. The _refracted_ angle is the angle made by the ray\r\nin the refracting medium with the same perpendicular produced. The\r\n_sine_ of the angle is a line which serves to measure the angle, being\r\ndrawn from a point in one leg perpendicular to the other. The following\r\nfigure (fig. 3.) will tend to illustrate these definitions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 3._]\r\n\r\nIn this figure BC is the incident ray, CE the refracted ray, DG the\r\nperpendicular, AD the sine of the angle of incidence ACD, and HR the\r\nsine of the angle of refraction GCE. Now, it is a proposition in optics\r\nthat,--the sine AD of the angle of incidence BCD is either accurately\r\nor very nearly in a given proportion to the sine HR of the angle of\r\nrefraction GCE. This ratio of the sines is as four to three, when the\r\nrefraction is made out of air into water, that is AD is to HR as four\r\nto three. When the refraction is out of air into glass, the proportion\r\nis about as thirty-one to twenty, or nearly as three to two. If the\r\nrefraction be out of air into diamond it is as five to two, that is\r\nAD : HR :: 5 : 2. The denser the medium is, the less is the angle and\r\nsine of refraction. If a ray of light MC, were to pass from air into\r\nwater, or from empty space into air, in the direction MC perpendicular\r\nto the plane NO which separates the two mediums, it would suffer no\r\nrefraction, because one of the essentials to that effect is wanting,\r\nnamely, the _obliquity_ of the incidence.\r\n\r\nIt may be also proper to remark, that a ray of light cannot pass out\r\nof a denser medium into a rarer, if the angle of incidence exceed a\r\ncertain limit. Thus a ray of light will not pass out of glass into air,\r\nif the angle of incidence exceed 40° 11´; or out of glass into water,\r\nif the angle of incidence exceed 59° 20´. In such cases refraction will\r\nbe changed into reflection.\r\n\r\nThe following common experiments, which are easily performed, will\r\nillustrate the doctrine of refraction. Put a shilling or any other\r\nsmall object which is easily distinguished, into a bason or any other\r\nsimilar vessel, and then retire to such a distance as that the edge\r\nof the vessel shall just hide it from your sight. If then you cause\r\nanother person to fill the vessel with water, you will then find that\r\nthe shilling is rendered perfectly visible, although you have not in\r\nthe slightest degree changed your position. The reason of this is,\r\nthat the rays of light, by which it is rendered visible, _are bent\r\nout of their course_. Thus, suppose the shilling to have been placed\r\nin the bottom of the bason at E, (fig. 2.) the ray of light BC which\r\npasses obliquely from the air into water at C, instead of continuing\r\nits course to K, takes the direction CE, and consequently an object\r\nat E would be rendered visible by rays proceeding in that direction,\r\nwhen they would not have touched it had they proceeded in their direct\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is illustrated by the following experiment. Place\r\na bason or square box on a table, and a candle at a small distance\r\nfrom it; lay a small rod or stick across the sides of the bason, and\r\nmark the place where the extremity of the shadow falls, by placing a\r\nshilling or other object at the point; then let water be poured into\r\nthe bason, and the shadow will then fall much nearer to the side next\r\nthe candle than before. This experiment may likewise be performed by\r\nsimply observing the change produced on the shadow of the side of\r\nthe bason itself. Again, put a long stick obliquely into deep water,\r\nand the stick will seem to be broken at the point where it appears\r\nat the surface of the water--the part which is immersed in the water\r\nappearing to be bent upwards. Hence every one must have observed that,\r\nin rowing a boat, the ends of the oars appear bent or broken every time\r\nthey are immersed in the water, and their appearance at such times is\r\na representation of the course of the refracted rays. Again, fill a\r\npretty deep jar with water, and you will observe the bottom of the jar\r\nconsiderably elevated, so that it appears much shallower than it did\r\nbefore the water was poured in, in the proportion of nearly a third of\r\nits depth, which is owing to the same cause as that which makes the\r\nend of a stick immersed in water appear more elevated than it would do\r\nif there were no refraction. Another experiment may be just mentioned.\r\nPut a sixpence in a wine-glass, and pour upon it a little water.\r\nWhen viewed in a certain position, two sixpences will appear in the\r\nglass--one image of the sixpence from below, which comes directly to\r\nthe eye, and another which appears considerably raised above the other,\r\nin consequence of the rays of light rising through the water, and being\r\nrefracted. In this experiment the wine-glass should not be more than\r\nhalf filled with water.\r\n\r\nThe refraction of light explains the causes of many curious and\r\ninteresting phenomena both in the heavens and on the earth. When we\r\nstand on the banks of a river, and look obliquely through the waters\r\nto its bottom, we are apt to think it is much shallower than it really\r\nis. If it be eight feet deep in reality, it will appear from the bank\r\nto be only six feet; if it be five feet and a half deep, it will appear\r\nonly about four feet. This is owing to the effects of refraction, by\r\nwhich the bottom of the river is apparently raised by the refraction\r\nof the light passing through the water into air, so as to make the\r\nbottom appear higher than it really is, as in the experiment with the\r\njar of water. This is a circumstance of some importance to be known\r\nand attended to in order to personal safety. For many school-boys and\r\nother young persons have lost their lives by attempting to ford a\r\nriver, the bottom of which appeared to be within their reach, when they\r\nviewed it from its banks: and even adult travellers on horseback have\r\nsometimes fallen victims to this optical deception; and this is not\r\nthe only case in which a knowledge of the laws of nature may be useful\r\nin guarding us against dangers and fatal accidents.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise owing to this refractive power in water, that a skilful\r\nmarksman who wishes to shoot fish under water, is obliged to take aim\r\nconsiderably _below_ the fish as it appears, because it seems much\r\nnearer the top of the water than it really is. An acquaintance with\r\nthis property of light is particularly useful to divers, for, in any\r\nof their movements or operations, should they aim directly at the\r\nobject, they would arrive at a point considerably beyond it; whereas,\r\nby having some idea of the depth of the water, and the angle which a\r\nline drawn from the eye to the object makes with its surface, the point\r\nat the bottom of the water, between the eye and the object at which the\r\naim is to be taken, may be easily determined. For the same reason, a\r\nperson below water does not see objects distinctly. For, as the aqueous\r\nhumour of the eye has the same refractive power as water, the rays of\r\nlight from any object under water will undergo no refraction in passing\r\nthrough the cornea, and aqueous humour, and will therefore meet in a\r\npoint far behind the retina. But if any person accustomed to go below\r\nwater should use a pair of spectacles, consisting of two convex lenses,\r\nthe radius of whose surface is three tenths of an inch--which is nearly\r\nthe radius of the convexity of the cornea--he will see objects as\r\ndistinctly below water as above it.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to refraction, that we cannot judge so accurately of\r\nmagnitudes and distances in water as in air. A fish looks considerably\r\nlarger in water than when taken out of it. An object plunged\r\n_vertically_ into water always appears contracted, and the more so as\r\nits upper extremity approaches nearer the surface of the water. Every\r\nthing remaining in the same situation, if we take the object gradually\r\nout of the water, and it be of a slender form, we shall see it become\r\nlarger and larger, by a rapid developement, as it were, of all its\r\nparts. The distortion of objects, seen through a crooked pane of glass\r\nin a window, likewise arises from its unequal refraction of the rays\r\nthat pass through it. It has been calculated that in looking through\r\nthe common glass of a window, objects appear about the one thirtieth of\r\nan inch out of their real place, by means of the refraction.\r\n\r\nRefraction likewise produces an effect upon the _heavenly bodies_, so\r\nthat their apparent positions are generally different from their real.\r\nBy the refractive power of the atmosphere, the sun is seen before he\r\ncomes to the horizon in the morning, and after he sinks beneath it in\r\nthe evening; and hence this luminary is never seen in the place in\r\nwhich it really is, except when it passes the zenith at noon, to places\r\nwithin the torrid zone. The sun is visible, when actually thirty-two\r\nminutes of a degree below the horizon, and when the opake rotundity of\r\nthe earth is interposed between our eye and that orb, just on the same\r\nprinciple as, in the experiment with the shilling and basin of water,\r\nthe shilling was seen when the edge of the basin interposed between it\r\nand the sight. The refractive power of the atmosphere has been found\r\nto be much greater, in certain cases, than what has been now stated.\r\nIn the year 1595 a company of Dutch sailors having been wrecked on\r\nthe shores of Nova Zembla, and having been obliged to remain in that\r\ndesolate region during a night of more than three months--beheld the\r\nsun make his appearance in the horizon about sixteen days before the\r\ntime in which he should have risen according to calculation, and when\r\nhis body was actually more than four degrees below the horizon; which\r\ncircumstance has been attributed to the great refractive power of the\r\natmosphere in those intensely cold regions. This refraction of the\r\natmosphere, which renders the apparent rising and setting of the sun\r\nboth earlier and later than the real, produces at least one important\r\nbeneficial effect. It procures for us the benefit of a much longer day,\r\nat all seasons of the year, than we should enjoy, did not this property\r\nof the atmosphere produce this effect. It is owing to the same cause\r\nthat the disks of the sun and moon appear elliptical or oval, when seen\r\nin the horizon, their horizontal diameters appearing longer than their\r\nvertical--which is caused by the greater refraction of the rays coming\r\nfrom the lower limb, which is immersed in the densest part of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe illumination of the heavens which precedes the rising of the sun,\r\nand continues sometime after he is set--or, what is commonly called\r\nthe morning and evening _twilight_--is likewise produced by the\r\natmospherical refraction--which circumstance forms a very pleasing and\r\nbeneficial arrangement in the system of nature. It not only prolongs\r\nto us the influence of the solar light, and adds nearly two hours to\r\nthe length of our day, but prevents us from being transported all at\r\nonce from the darkness of midnight to the splendour of noon-day, and\r\nfrom the effulgence of day to the gloom and horrors of the night--which\r\nwould bewilder the traveller and navigator in their journeys by sea or\r\nland, and strike the living world with terror and amazement.\r\n\r\nThe following figure will illustrate the position now stated, and\r\nthe manner in which the refraction of the atmosphere produces these\r\neffects. Let A _a_ C, fig. 4, represent one half of our globe, and the\r\ndark space between that curve and B _r_ D, the atmosphere. A person\r\nstanding on the earth’s surface at _a_ would see the sun rise at _b_,\r\nwhen that luminary was in reality only at _c_--more than half a degree\r\nbelow the horizon. When the rays of the sun, after having proceeded\r\nin a straight line through empty space, strike the upper part of the\r\natmosphere at the point _d_, they are bent out of their right-lined\r\ncourse, by the refraction of the atmosphere, into the direction _d a_,\r\nso that the body of the sun, though actually intercepted by the curve\r\nof the earth’s convexity consisting of a dense mass of land or water,\r\nis actually beheld by the spectator at _a_. The refractive power of the\r\natmosphere gradually diminishes from the horizon to the zenith, and\r\nincreases from the zenith to the horizon, in proportion to the density\r\nof its different strata, being densest at its lower extremity next the\r\nearth, and more rare towards its higher regions. If a person at _a_\r\nhad the sun, _e_, in his zenith, he would see him where he really\r\nis; for his rays coming perpendicularly through the atmosphere, would\r\nbe equally attracted in all directions, and would therefore suffer no\r\ninflection. But, about two in the afternoon, he would see the sun at\r\n_i_, though, in reality, he was at _k_, thirty-three seconds lower than\r\nhis apparent situation. At about four in the afternoon he would see him\r\nat _m_, when he is at _n_, one minute and thirty-eight seconds from his\r\napparent situation. But at six o’clock, when we shall suppose he sets,\r\nhe will be seen at _o_, though he is at that time at _p_, more than\r\nthirty-two minutes below the horizon. These phenomena arise from the\r\ndifferent refractive powers of the atmosphere at different elevations,\r\nand from the obliquity with which the rays of light fall upon it; for\r\nwe see every object along that line in which the rays from it are\r\ndirected by the last medium through which they passed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 4._]\r\n\r\nThe same phenomena happen in relation to the moon, the planets, the\r\ncomets, the stars, and every other celestial body, all of which appear\r\nmore elevated, especially when near the horizon, than their true\r\nplaces. The variable and increasing refraction from the zenith to the\r\nhorizon, is a source of considerable trouble and difficulty in making\r\nastronomical observations, and in nautical calculations. For, in order\r\nto determine the real altitudes of the heavenly bodies, the exact\r\ndegree of refraction, at the observed elevation, must be taken into\r\naccount. To the same cause we are to ascribe a phenomenon that has\r\nsometimes occurred--namely, that the moon has been seen rising totally\r\neclipsed, while the sun was still visible in the opposite quarter of\r\nthe horizon. At the middle of a total eclipse of the moon, the sun\r\nand moon are in opposition, or 180 degrees asunder; and, therefore,\r\nwere no atmosphere surrounding the earth, these luminaries, in such a\r\nposition, could never be seen above the horizon at the same time. But,\r\nby the refraction of the atmosphere near the horizon, the bodies of the\r\nsun and moon are raised more than 32 minutes above their true places,\r\nwhich is equal, and sometimes more than equal to the apparent diameters\r\nof these bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extraordinary cases of refraction in relation to terrestrial objects._\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the accidental condensation of certain strata of\r\nthe atmosphere, some very singular effects have been produced in the\r\napparent elevation of terrestrial objects to a position much beyond\r\nthat in which they usually appear. The following instance is worthy of\r\nnotice. It is taken from the Philosophical Transactions of London for\r\n1798, and was communicated by W. Latham, Esq., F.R.S., who observed\r\nthe phenomenon from Hastings, on the south coast of England:--‘On July\r\n26, 1797, about five o’clock in the afternoon, as I was sitting in my\r\ndining-room in this place, which is situated upon the Parade, close\r\nto the sea-shore, nearly fronting the south, my attention was excited\r\nby a number of people running down to the sea-side. Upon inquiring\r\nthe reason, I was informed, that the coast of France was plainly to\r\nbe distinguished by the naked eye. I immediately went down to the\r\nshore, and was surprised to find that, even without the assistance\r\nof a telescope, I could very plainly see the cliffs on the opposite\r\ncoast, which, at the nearest part, are between forty and fifty miles\r\ndistant, and are not to be discerned from that low situation by the\r\naid of the best glasses. They appeared to be only a few miles off,\r\nand seemed to extend for some leagues along the coast. I pursued my\r\nwalk along the shore eastward, close to the water’s edge, conversing\r\nwith the sailors and fishermen upon the subject. They at first would\r\nnot be persuaded of the reality of the appearance; but they soon\r\nbecame so thoroughly convinced by the cliffs gradually appearing more\r\nelevated, and approaching nearer, as it were, that they pointed out and\r\nnamed to me the different places they had been accustomed to visit,\r\nsuch as the Bay, the Old Head, or Man, the Windmill, &c. at Boulogne,\r\nSt. Vallery, and other places on the coast of Picardy, which they\r\nafterwards confirmed, when they viewed them through their telescopes.\r\nTheir observations were, that the places appeared as near as if they\r\nwere sailing, at a small distance, into the harbours. The day on which\r\nthis phenomenon was seen was extremely hot; it was high water at\r\nHastings about two o’clock, P.M., and not a breath of wind was\r\nstirring the whole day.’ From the summit of an adjacent hill, a most\r\nbeautiful scene is said to have presented itself. At one glance the\r\nspectators could see Dungeness, Dover Cliffs, and the French coast, all\r\nalong from Calais to St. Vallery, and, as some affirmed, as far to the\r\nwestward as Dieppe, which could not be much less than eighty or ninety\r\nmiles. By the telescope, the French fishing-boats were plainly seen at\r\nanchor, and the different colours of the land on the heights, with the\r\nbuildings, were perfectly discernible.\r\n\r\nThis singular phenomenon was doubtless occasioned by an extraordinary\r\nrefraction produced either by an unusual expansion, or condensation\r\nof the lower strata of the atmosphere, arising from circumstances\r\nconnected with the extreme heat of the season. The objects seem to\r\nhave been apparently raised far above their natural positions; for,\r\nfrom the beach at Hastings, a straight line drawn across towards the\r\nFrench coast, would have been intercepted by the curve of the waters.\r\nThey seem also to have been magnified by the refraction, and brought\r\napparently four or five times nearer the eye than in the ordinary state\r\nof the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe following are likewise instances of unusual refraction:--When\r\nCaptain Colby was ranging over the coast of Caithness, with the\r\ntelescope of his great Theodolite, on the 21st of June, 1819, at\r\neight o’clock, P.M. from Corryhabbie Hill, near Mortlich, in\r\nBanffshire, he observed a brig over the land of Caithness, sailing to\r\nthe westward in the Pentland Frith, between the Dunnet and Duncansby\r\nheads. Having satisfied himself as to the fact, he requested his\r\nassistants, Lieutenants Robe and Dawson, to look through the telescope,\r\nwhich they immediately did, and observed the brig likewise. It was\r\nvery distinctly visible for several minutes, while the party continued\r\nto look at it, and to satisfy themselves as to its position. The brig\r\ncould not have been less than from ninety to one hundred miles distant;\r\nand, as the station on Corryhabbie is not above 850 yards above the\r\nsea, the phenomenon is interesting. The thermometer was at 44°. The\r\nnight and day preceding the sight of the brig had been continually\r\nrainy and misty, and it was not till 7 o’clock of the evening of the\r\n21st that the clouds cleared off the hill.[8]\r\n\r\nCaptain Scoresby relates a singular phenomenon of this kind, which\r\noccurred while he was traversing the Polar seas. His ship had been\r\nseparated by the ice from that of his father for a considerable time,\r\nand he was looking out for her every day, with great anxiety. At\r\nlength, one evening, to his utter astonishment, he saw her suspended in\r\nthe air, in an inverted position, traced on the horizon in the clearest\r\ncolours, and with the most distinct and perfect representation. He\r\nsailed in the direction in which he saw this visionary phenomenon, and\r\nactually found his father’s vessel by its indication. He was divided\r\nfrom him by immense masses of icebergs, and at such a distance, that\r\nit was quite impossible to have seen the ship in her actual situation,\r\nor to have seen her at all, if her spectrum had not been thus raised\r\nseveral degrees above the horizon into the sky by this extraordinary\r\nrefraction. She was reckoned to be seventeen miles beyond the visible\r\nhorizon, and thirty miles distant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Somerville states, that a friend of her’s, while standing on\r\nthe plains of Hindostan, saw the whole upper chain of the Himalaya\r\nmountains start into view, from a sudden change in the density of the\r\nair, occasioned by a heavy shower, after a long course of dry and hot\r\nweather. In looking at distant objects through a telescope, over the\r\ntop of a ridge of hills, about two miles distant, I have several times\r\nobserved, that some of the more distant objects which are sometimes\r\nhid by the interposition of a ridge of hills, are, at other times,\r\ndistinctly visible above them. I have sometimes observed, that objects\r\nnear the middle of the field of view of a telescope, which was in a\r\nfixed position, have suddenly appeared to descend to the lower part,\r\nor ascend to the upper part of the field, while the telescope remained\r\nunaltered. I have likewise seen, with a powerful telescope, the Bell\r\nRock Lighthouse, at the distance of about twenty miles, to appear as if\r\ncontracted to less than two-thirds of its usual apparent height, while\r\nevery part of it was quite distinct and well-defined, and in the course\r\nof an hour or less, it appeared to shoot up to its usual apparent\r\nelevation--all which phenomena are evidently produced by the same cause\r\nto which we have been adverting.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the striking effects produced by the refraction of\r\nlight. It enables us to see objects in a direction where they are not;\r\nit raises, apparently, the bottoms of lakes and rivers: it magnifies\r\nobjects when their light passes through dense mediums: it makes the\r\nsun appear above the horizon, when he is actually below it, and thus\r\nincreases the length of our day: it produces the Aurora and the evening\r\ntwilight, which forms, in many instances, the most delightful part of a\r\nsummer day: it prevents us from being involved in total darkness, the\r\nmoment after the sun has descended beneath the horizon: it modifies the\r\nappearances of the celestial bodies, and the directions in which they\r\nare beheld: it tinges the sun, moon, and stars, as well as the clouds,\r\nwith a ruddy hue, when near the horizon: it elevates the appearance of\r\nterrestrial objects, and, in certain extraordinary cases, brings them\r\nnearer to our view, and enables us to behold them when beyond the line\r\nof our visible horizon. In combination with the power of reflection,\r\nit creates visionary landscapes, and a variety of grotesque and\r\nextraordinary appearances, which delight and astonish, and sometimes\r\nappal the beholders. In short,--as we shall afterwards see more\r\nparticularly--the refraction of light through glasses of different\r\nfigures, forms the principle on which telescopes and microscopes\r\nare constructed, by which both the remote and the minute wonders of\r\ncreation have been disclosed to view. So that had there been no bodies\r\ncapable of refracting the rays of light, we should have remained for\r\never ignorant of many sublime and august objects in the remote regions\r\nof the universe, and of the admirable mechanism and the countless\r\nvariety of minute objects which lie beyond the range of the unassisted\r\neye in our lower creation, all of which are calculated to direct our\r\nviews, and to enlarge our conceptions of the Almighty Creator.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of the law of refraction in these and numerous other\r\ninstances, we have a specimen of the diversified and beneficent effects\r\nwhich the Almighty can produce by the agency of a single principle in\r\nnature. By the influence of the simple law of gravitation, the planets\r\nare retained in their orbits, the moon directed in her course around\r\nthe earth, and the whole of the bodies connected with the sun preserved\r\nin one harmonious system. By the same law the mountains of our globe\r\nrest on a solid basis, the rivers flow through the plains toward the\r\nseas, the ocean is confined to its prescribed boundaries, and the\r\ninhabitants of the earth are retained to its surface and prevented\r\nfrom flying upwards through the voids of space. In like manner the law\r\nby which light is refracted produces a variety of beneficial effects\r\nessential to the present constitution of our world and the comfort\r\nof its inhabitants. When a ray of light enters obliquely into the\r\natmosphere, instead of passing directly through, it bends a little\r\ndownwards, so that the greater portion of the rays which thus enter the\r\natmospheric mass, descend by inflection to the earth. We then enjoy\r\nthe benefit of that light which would otherwise have been totally\r\nlost. We perceive the light of day an hour before the solar orb makes\r\nits appearance, and a portion of its light is still retained when\r\nit has descended nearly eighteen degrees below our horizon. We thus\r\nenjoy, throughout the year, seven hundred and thirty hours of light\r\nwhich would have been lost, had it not been refracted down upon us\r\nfrom the upper regions of the atmosphere. To the inhabitants of the\r\npolar regions this effect is still more interesting and beneficial.\r\nWere it not for their twilight, they would be involved, for a much\r\nlonger period than they now are, in perpetual darkness; but by the\r\npowerful refraction of light which takes place in the frigid zones, the\r\nday sooner makes its appearance towards spring, and their long winter\r\nnights are, in certain cases, shortened by a period of thirty days.\r\nUnder the poles, where the darkness of night would continue six months\r\nwithout intermission, if there were no refraction, total darkness does\r\nnot prevail during the one half of this period. When the sun sets, at\r\nthe North pole about the 23rd of September, the inhabitants (if any)\r\nenjoy a perpetual aurora, till he has descended 18 degrees below the\r\nhorizon. In his course through the ecliptic the sun is two months\r\nbefore he can reach this point, during which time there is a perpetual\r\ntwilight. In two months more he arrives again at the same point, namely\r\n18 degrees below the horizon, when a new twilight commences, which is\r\ncontinually increasing in brilliancy, for other two months, at the end\r\nof which the body of this luminary is seen rising in all its glory.\r\nSo that, in this region, the light of day is enjoyed, in a greater or\r\nless degree, for ten months without interruption, by the effects of\r\natmospheric refraction; and, during the two months when the influence\r\nof the solar light is entirely withdrawn, the moon is shining above the\r\nhorizon for two half months without intermission; and thus it happens,\r\nthat no more than two separate fortnights are passed in absolute\r\ndarkness; and this darkness is alleviated by the light of the stars and\r\nthe frequent coruscations of the Aurora Borealis. Hence, it appears,\r\nthat there are no portions of our globe that enjoy, throughout the\r\nyear, so large a portion of the solar light, as these northern regions,\r\nwhich is chiefly owing to the refraction of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe refraction of light by the atmosphere, combined with its power\r\nof reflecting it, is likewise the cause of that universal light and\r\nsplendour which appears on all the objects around us. Were the earth\r\ndisrobed of its atmosphere, and exposed naked to the solar beams--in\r\nthis case, we might see the sun without having day, strictly so called.\r\nHis rising would not be preceded by any twilight as it now is. The most\r\nintense darkness would cover us till the very moment of his rising;\r\nhe would then suddenly break out from under the horizon with the same\r\nsplendour he would exhibit at the highest part of his course, and would\r\nnot change his brightness till the very moment of his setting, when\r\nin an instant all would be black as the darkest night. At noon day we\r\nshould see the sun like an intensely brilliant globe shining in a sky\r\nas black as ebony, like a clear fire in the night seen in the midst of\r\nan extensive field, and his rays would show us the adjacent objects\r\nimmediately around us; but the rays which fall on the objects remote\r\nfrom us would be for ever lost in the expanse of the heavens. Instead\r\nof the beautiful azure of the sky, and the colours which distinguish\r\nthe face of nature by day, we should see nothing but an abyss of\r\ndarkness, and the stars shining from a vault as dark as chaos. Thus\r\nthere would be no day, such as we now enjoy, without the atmosphere:\r\nsince it is by the refraction and reflections connected with this\r\naerial fluid that light is so modified and directed, as to produce all\r\nthat beauty, splendour and harmony, which appear on the concave of the\r\nsky, and on the objects which diversify our terrestrial abode.\r\n\r\nThe effect of refraction, in respect to _terrestrial_ objects, is\r\nlikewise of a beneficial nature. The quantity of this refraction\r\nis estimated by Dr. Maskelyne at one-tenth of the distance of the\r\nobject observed, expressed in degrees of a great circle. Hence, if\r\nthe distance be 10,000 fathoms, its tenth part 1000 fathoms, is the\r\nsixtieth part of a degree, or one minute, which is the refraction\r\nin altitude. Le Gendre estimates it at one fourteenth; De Lambre at\r\none eleventh; and others at a twelfth of the distance; but it must\r\nbe supposed to vary at different times and places according to the\r\nvarying state of the atmosphere. This refraction, as it makes objects\r\nappear to be raised higher than they really are, enlarges the extent\r\nof our landscapes, and enables us to perceive distant objects which\r\nwould otherwise have been invisible. It is particularly useful to\r\nthe navigator at sea. It is one important object of the mariner when\r\ntraversing his course, to look out for capes and headlands, rocks and\r\nislands, so as to descry them as soon as they are within the reach\r\nof his eye. Now, by means of refraction, the tops of hills and the\r\nelevated parts of coasts, are apparently raised into the air, so that\r\nthey may be discovered several leagues further off on the sea than\r\nthey would be, did no such refractive power exist. This circumstance\r\nis therefore a considerable benefit to the science of navigation, in\r\nenabling the mariner to steer his course aright, and to give him the\r\nmost early warning of the track he ought to take, or of the dangers to\r\nwhich he may be exposed.\r\n\r\nIn short, the effects produced by the refraction and reflection of\r\nlight on the scenery connected with our globe, teach us that these\r\nprinciples, in the hand of the Almighty, might be so modified and\r\ndirected, as to produce the most picturesque, the most glorious and\r\nwonderful phenomena, such as mortal eyes have never yet seen, and of\r\nwhich human imagination can form no conception; and in other worlds,\r\nmore resplendent and magnificent than ours, such scenes may be fully\r\nrealized, in combination with the operation of physical principles and\r\nagents, with which we are at present unacquainted. From what we already\r\nknow of the effects of the reflection and the refraction of light, it\r\nis not beyond the bounds of probability to suppose, that in certain\r\nregions of the universe, light may be reflected and refracted through\r\ndifferent mediums, in such a manner, as to present to the view of\r\ntheir inhabitants the prominent scenes connected with distant systems\r\nand worlds, and to an extent, as shall infinitely surpass the effects\r\nproduced by our most powerful telescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT THROUGH SPHERICAL TRANSPARENT SUBSTANCES, OR\r\nLENSES.\r\n\r\nIt is to the refraction of light that we are indebted for the use\r\nof lenses or artificial glasses to aid the powers of vision. It\r\nlays the foundation of telescopes, microscopes, camera obscuras,\r\nphantasmagorias, and other optical instruments, by which so many\r\nbeautiful, useful, and wonderful effects have been produced. In order\r\ntherefore to illustrate the principles on which such instruments are\r\nconstructed, it is necessary to explain the manner in which the rays\r\nof light are refracted and modified, when passing through spherical\r\nmediums of different forms. I do not intend however to enter into\r\nthe minutiæ of this subject, nor into any abstract mathematical\r\ndemonstrations, but shall simply offer a few explanations of general\r\nprinciples, and several experimental illustrations, which may enable\r\nthe general reader to understand the construction of the optical\r\ninstruments to be afterwards described.\r\n\r\nA lens is a transparent substance of a different density from the\r\nsurrounding medium, and terminating in two surfaces, either both\r\nspherical, or one spherical and the other plain. It is usually made\r\nof _glass_, but may also be formed of any other transparent substance,\r\nas ice, crystal, diamond, pebbles, or by fluids of different densities\r\nand refractive powers, enclosed between concave glasses. Lenses are\r\nground into various forms, according to the purpose they are intended\r\nto serve. They may be generally distinguished as being either _convex_\r\nor _concave_. A convex glass is thickest in the middle, and thinner\r\ntowards the edges. A concave glass is thin in the middle, and thicker\r\ntowards the extremities. Of these there are various forms, which are\r\nrepresented in fig. 5. A, is a _plano-convex_ lens, which has one side\r\nplane, and the other spherical or convex. B, is a _plano-concave_,\r\nwhich is plane on the one side and concave on the other. C, is a\r\n_double-convex_, or one which is spherical on both sides. D, a\r\n_double-concave_, or concave on both sides. E, is called a _meniscus_,\r\nwhich is convex on one side and concave on the other. F, is a\r\n_concavo-convex_, the convex side of which is of a smaller sphere than\r\nthe concave. In regard to the _degree_ of convexity or concavity in\r\nlenses, it is evident that there may be almost an infinite variety. For\r\nevery convex surface is to be considered as the segment of a circle,\r\nthe diameter and radius of which may vary to almost any extent. Hence,\r\nlenses have been formed by opticians, varying from one-fiftieth of an\r\ninch in radius, to two hundred feet. When we speak of the length of\r\nthe radius of a lens,--as for instance, when we say that a lens is two\r\ninches or forty inches radius, we mean, that the convex surface of the\r\nglass is the part of a circle the radius of which, or half the diameter\r\nis two inches or forty inches; or in other words, were the portion of\r\nthe sphere on which it is ground formed into a globe of corresponding\r\nconvexity, it would be four inches or eighty inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 5._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 6._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 7._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 8._]\r\n\r\nThe _axis_ of a lens is a straight line drawn through the center of its\r\nspherical surface; and as the spherical sides of every lens are arches\r\nof circles the axis of the lens would pass through the centre of that\r\ncircle of which its sides are segments. _Rays_ are those emanations\r\nof light which proceed from a luminous body, or from a body that is\r\nilluminated. The _Radiant_ is that body or object which emits the rays\r\nof light--whether it be a self-luminous body, or one that only reflects\r\nthe rays of light. Rays may proceed from a Radiant in different\r\ndirections. They may be either parallel, converging, or diverging.\r\n_Parallel_ rays are those which proceed _equally distant_ from each\r\nother through their whole course. Rays proceeding from the sun, the\r\nplanets, the stars, and distant terrestrial objects are considered as\r\nparallel, as in fig. 6. _Converging_ rays are such as, proceeding from\r\na body, approach nearer and nearer in their progress, tending to a\r\ncertain point where they all unite. Thus, the rays proceeding from the\r\nobject AB, (fig. 7.) to the point F, are said to converge towards that\r\npoint. All convex glasses cause parallel rays, which fall upon them\r\nto converge in a greater or less degree; and they render converging\r\nrays still more convergent. If AB, fig. 7. represent a convex lens,\r\nand H G I parallel rays falling upon it, they will be refracted and\r\nconverge towards the point F, which is called the _focus_, or burning\r\npoint; because, when the sun’s rays are thus converged to a point by a\r\nlarge lens, they set on fire combustible substances. In this point the\r\nrays meet and intersect each other. _Diverging rays_ are those which,\r\nproceeding from any point as A, fig. 8, continually recede from each\r\nother as they pass along in their course towards BC. All the rays which\r\nproceed from near objects as a window in a room, or an adjacent house\r\nor garden are more or less divergent. The following figures show the\r\neffects of parallel, converging and diverging rays in passing through\r\na double convex lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 11._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 9._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 10._]\r\n\r\nFig. 9, shows the effects of parallel rays, KA, DE, LB, falling on a\r\nconvex glass AB. The rays which fall near the extremities at A and B,\r\nare bent or refracted towards CF, the focus, and centre of convexity.\r\nIt will be observed, that they are less refracted as they approach\r\nthe center of the lens, and the central ray DEC, which is called the\r\n_axis_ of the lens, and which passes through its center, suffers\r\nno refraction. Fig. 10, exhibits the course of _converging_ rays,\r\nwhen passing through a similar lens. In this case the rays converge\r\nto a focus _nearer_ to the lens than the center; for a convex lens\r\nuniformly increases the convergence of converging rays. The converging\r\nrays here represented, may be conceived as having been refracted by\r\nanother convex lens of a longer focus, and, passing on towards a point\r\nof convergence, were intercepted by the lens AB. The point D is the\r\nplace where the rays would have converged to a focus, had they not been\r\nthus intercepted. Fig. 11, represents the course of diverging rays\r\nwhen falling on a double convex glass. In this case the rays D B, D A,\r\n&c., after passing through the lens, converge to a focus at a point\r\nconsiderably farther from the lens than its centre, as at F. Such rays\r\nmust be considered as proceeding from near objects, and the fact may be\r\nillustrated by the following experiment. Take a common reading-glass,\r\nand hold it in the rays of the sun, opposite a sheet of writing-paper\r\nor a white wall, and observe _at what distance_ from the glass the rays\r\non the paper converge to a small distinct white spot. This distance\r\ngives the focal length of the lens by parallel rays. If now, we hold\r\nthe glass within a few feet of a window, or a burning candle, and\r\nreceive its image on the paper, the focal distance of the image from\r\nthe glass will be found to be longer. If, in the former case, the focal\r\ndistance was twelve inches,--in the latter case it will be thirteen,\r\nfifteen, or sixteen inches, according to the distance of the window or\r\nthe candle from the glass.\r\n\r\nIf the lens A B, fig. 9, on which parallel rays are represented as\r\nfalling, were a _plano-convex_, as represented at A, fig, 5, the rays\r\nwould converge to a point P, at double the radius, or the whole\r\ndiameter of the sphere of which it is a segment. If the thickness of a\r\nplano-convex be considered, and if it be exposed on its convex side to\r\nparallel rays, as those of the sun, the focus will be at the distance\r\nof _twice the radius, wanting two-thirds of the thickness of the lens_.\r\nBut if the same lens be exposed with its plane side to parallel rays,\r\nthe focus will then be precisely at the distance of twice the radius\r\nfrom the glass.\r\n\r\nThe effects of _concave_ lenses are directly opposite to those of\r\nconvex. Parallel rays, striking one of those glasses, instead of\r\nconverging towards a point, are made to _diverge_. Rays already\r\ndivergent are rendered more so, and convergent rays are made less\r\nconvergent. Hence objects seen through concave glasses appear\r\nconsiderably smaller and more distant than they really are. The\r\nfollowing diagram, fig. 12, represents the course of parallel rays\r\nthrough a double concave lens, where the parallel rays T A, D E, I B,\r\n&c., when passing through the concave glass A B, diverge into the rays\r\nG L, E C, H P, &c., as if they proceeded from F, a point before the\r\nlens, which is the principal focus of the lens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 12._]\r\n\r\nThe principal focal distance E F, is the same as in convex lenses.\r\nConcave glasses are used to correct the imperfect vision of\r\nshort-sighted persons. As the form of the eye of such persons is too\r\nconvex, the rays are made to converge before they reach the optic\r\nnerve; and therefore a concave glass, causing a little divergency,\r\nassists this defect of vision, by diminishing the effect produced\r\nby the too great convexity of the eye, and lengthening its focus.\r\nThese glasses are seldom used, in modern times, in the construction\r\nof optical instruments, except as eye-glasses for small pocket\r\nperspectives, and opera glasses.\r\n\r\n_To find the focal distance of a concave glass._ Take a piece of\r\npaste-board or card paper, and cut a round hole in it, not larger\r\nthan the diameter of the lens; and, on another piece of paste-board,\r\ndescribe a circle whose diameter is just double the diameter of the\r\nhole. Then apply the piece with the hole in it to the lens, and hold\r\nthem in the sun-beams, with the other piece at such a distance behind,\r\nthat the light proceeding from the hole may spread or diverge so as\r\nprecisely to fill the circle; then the distance of the circle from the\r\nlens is equal to its virtual focus, or to its radius, if it be a double\r\nconcave, and to its diameter, if a plano-concave. Let _d, e_, (fig.\r\n12,) represent the diameter of the hole, and _g, i_, the diameter of\r\nthe circle, then the distance C, I, is the virtual focus of the lens.[9]\r\n\r\nThe _meniscus_ represented at E, fig. 5, is like the crystal of a\r\ncommon watch, and as the convexity is the same as the concavity,\r\nit neither magnifies nor diminishes. Sometimes, however, it is\r\nmade in the form of a crescent, as at F, fig. 5, and is called a\r\n_concavo-convex_ lens; and, when the convexity is greater than the\r\nconcavity, or, when it is thickest in the middle, it acts nearly in the\r\nsame way as a double or plano-convex lens of the same focal distance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the_ IMAGES _formed by convex lenses._\r\n\r\nIt is a remarkable circumstance, and which would naturally excite\r\nadmiration, were it not so common and well known, that _when the rays\r\nof light from any object are refracted through a convex lens, they\r\npaint a distinct and accurate picture of the object before it, in all\r\nits colours, shades, and proportions_. Previous to experience, we\r\ncould have had no conception that light, when passing through such\r\nsubstances, and converging to a point, could have produced so admirable\r\nan effect,--an effect on which the construction and utility of all our\r\noptical instruments depend. The following figure will illustrate this\r\nposition. Let L, N, represent a double convex lens, A, C, _a_, its\r\naxis, and OB, an object perpendicular to it. A ray passing from the\r\nextremity of the object at O, after being refracted by the lens at F,\r\nwill pass on in the direction FI, and form an image of that part of the\r\nobject at I. This ray will be the axis of all the rays which fall on\r\nthe lens from the point O, and I will be the focus where they will all\r\nbe collected. In like manner BCM, is the axis of that parcel of rays\r\nwhich proceed from the extremity of the object B, and their focus will\r\nbe at M; and since all the points in the object between O, and B, must\r\nnecessarily have their foci between I and M, a complete picture of the\r\npoints from which they come will be depicted, and consequently an image\r\nof the whole object OB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 13._]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, from the figure, that the image of the object is\r\nformed in the focus of the lens, in an _inverted position_. It must\r\nnecessarily be in this position, as the rays cross at C, the centre of\r\nthe lens; and as it is impossible that the rays from the upper part\r\nof the object O, can be carried by refraction to the upper end of\r\nthe image at M. This is a universal principle in relation to convex\r\nlenses of every description, and requires to be attended to in the\r\nconstruction and use of all kinds of telescopes and microscopes. It\r\nis easily illustrated by experiment. Take a convex lens of eight,\r\ntwelve, or fifteen inches focal distance, such as a reading glass, or\r\nthe glass belonging to a pair of spectacles, and holding it, at its\r\nfocal distance from a white wall, in a line with a burning candle, the\r\nflame of the candle will be seen depicted on the wall in an inverted\r\nposition, or turned upside down. The same experiment may be performed\r\nwith a window-sash, or any other bright object. But, the most beautiful\r\nexhibition of the images of objects formed by convex lenses, is made\r\nby darkening a room, and placing a convex lens of a long focal distance\r\nin a hole cut out of the window-shutter; when a beautiful inverted\r\nlandscape, or picture of all the objects before the window, will be\r\npainted on a white paper or screen placed in the focus of the glass.\r\nThe image thus formed exhibits not only the proportions and colours,\r\nbut also the motions of all the objects opposite the lens, forming as\r\nit were a living landscape. This property of lenses lays the foundation\r\nof the camera obscura, an instrument to be afterwards described.\r\n\r\nThe following principles in relation to images formed by convex lenses\r\nmay be stated. 1. That _the image subtends the same angle at the centre\r\nof the glass as the object itself does_. Were an eye placed at C, the\r\ncentre of the lens LN, fig. 13, it would see the object OB, and the\r\nimage IM under the same optical angle, or, in other words, they would\r\nappear equally large. For, whenever right lines intersect each other,\r\nas OI and BM, the opposite angles are always equal, that is, the angle\r\nMCI is equal to the angle OCB. 2. _The length of the image formed by\r\na convex lens, is to the length of the object, as the distance of the\r\nimage is to the distance of the object from the lens_: that is, MI is\r\nto OB :: as CA to CA. Suppose the distance of the object CA\r\nfrom the lens, to be forty-eight inches, the length of the object OB\r\n= sixteen inches, and the distance of the image from the lens, six\r\ninches, then the length of the image will be found by the following\r\nproportion, 48 : 16 :: 6 : 2, that is, the length of the image, in such\r\na case, is two inches. 3. _If the object be at an infinite distance,\r\nthe image will be formed exactly in the focus._ 4. _If the object be\r\nat the same distance from the lens as its focus, the image is removed\r\nto an infinite distance on the opposite side_; in other words, the\r\nrays will proceed in a _parallel_ direction. On this principle, lamps\r\non the streets are sometimes directed to throw a bright light along a\r\nfoot-path where it is wanted, when a large convex glass is placed at\r\nits focal distance from the burner; and on the same principle, light\r\nis thrown to a great distance from lighthouses, either by a very large\r\nconvex lens of a short focal distance, or by a concave reflector. 5.\r\n_If the object be at double the distance of the focus from the glass,\r\nthe image will also be at double the distance of the focus from the\r\nglass._ Thus, if a lens of six inches focal distance be held at twelve\r\ninches distance from a candle, the image of the candle will be formed\r\nat twelve inches from the glass on the other side. 6. _If the object\r\nbe a little further from the lens than its focal distance, an image\r\nwill be formed, at a distance from the object, which will be greater\r\nor smaller in proportion to the distance._ For example, if a lens\r\nfive inches focus, be held at a little more than five inches from a\r\ncandle, and a wall or screen at five feet six inches distant, receive\r\nthe image, a large and inverted image of the candle will be depicted,\r\nwhich will be magnified in proportion as the distance of the wall\r\nfrom the candle exceeds the distance of the lens from the candle.\r\nSuppose the distance of the lens to be five and a half inches, then\r\nthe distance of the wall where the image is formed, being twelve times\r\ngreater, the image of the candle will be magnified twelve times. If\r\nMI (fig. 13.) be considered as the object, then OB will represent the\r\nmagnified image on the wall. On this principle the image of the object\r\nis formed by the small object glass of a compound microscope. On the\r\nsame principle the large pictures are formed by the Magic Lantern and\r\nthe Phantasmagoria; and in the same way small objects are represented\r\nin a magnified form, on a sheet or wall by the Solar microscope. 7.\r\n_All convex lenses magnify the objects seen through them, in a greater\r\nor less degree._ The shorter the focal distance of the lens, the\r\ngreater is the magnifying power. A lens four inches focal distance,\r\nwill magnify objects placed in the focus, two times in length and\r\nbreadth; a lens two inches focus will magnify four times, a lens one\r\ninch focus eight times; a lens half an inch focus sixteen times, &c.\r\nsupposing eight inches to be the least distance at which we see near\r\nobjects distinctly. In viewing objects with small lenses, the object\r\nto be magnified should be placed exactly at the focal distance of the\r\nlens, and the eye at about the same distance on the other side of\r\nthe lens. When we speak of magnifying power, as, for example, that a\r\nlens one inch focal distance magnifies objects eight times, it is to\r\nbe understood of the _lineal_ dimensions of the object. But as every\r\nobject at which we look has breadth as well as length, the _surface_\r\nof the object is in reality magnified sixty-four times, or the square\r\nof its lineal dimensions; and for the same reason a lens half an inch\r\nfocal distance magnifies the _surfaces_ of objects 256 times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reflections deduced from the preceding subject._\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the leading principles which require to be recognised\r\nin the construction of refracting telescopes, microscopes, and\r\nother dioptric instruments whose performance chiefly depends on the\r\n_refraction_ of light.--It is worthy of particular notice that all the\r\nphenomena of optical lenses now described, depend upon that peculiar\r\nproperty which the Creator has impressed upon the rays of light, that,\r\n_when they are refracted to a focus by a convex transparent substance,\r\nthey depict an accurate image of the objects whence they proceed_.\r\nThis, however common, and however much overlooked by the bulk of\r\nmankind, is indeed a very wonderful property with which light has been\r\nendued. Previous to experience we could have had no conception that\r\nsuch an effect would be produced; and, in the first instance, we could\r\nnot possibly have traced it to all its consequences. All the objects\r\nin creation might have been illuminated as they now are, for aught\r\nwe know, without sending forth either direct or reflected rays _with\r\nthe property of forming exact representations of the objects whence\r\nthey proceeded_. But this we find to be a universal law in regard to\r\nlight of every description, whether as emanating directly from the\r\nsun, or as reflected from the objects he illuminates, or as proceeding\r\nfrom bodies artificially enlightened. It is a law or a property of\r\nlight not only in our own system, but throughout all the systems of\r\nthe universe to which mortal eyes have yet penetrated. The rays from\r\nthe most distant star which astronomers have descried, are endued\r\nwith this property, otherwise they could never have been perceived by\r\nmeans of our optical instruments; for it is by the pictures or images\r\nformed in these instruments that such distant objects are brought to\r\nview. Without this property of light, therefore, we should have had\r\nno telescopes, and consequently we could not have surveyed, as we can\r\nnow do, the hills and vales, the deep caverns, the extensive plains,\r\nthe circular ranges of mountains, and many other novel scenes which\r\ndiversify the surface of our moon. We should have known nothing of the\r\nstupendous spots which appear on the surface of the sun--of the phases\r\nof Venus--of the satellites and belts of Jupiter--of the majestic rings\r\nof Saturn--of the existence of Uranus and his six moons,--or of the\r\nplanets Vesta, Juno, Ceres, and Pallas, nor could the exact bulks of\r\nany of these bodies have been accurately determined. But, above all,\r\nwe should have been entirely ignorant of the wonderful phenomena of\r\ndouble stars--which demonstrate that suns revolve around suns--of the\r\nthousands and millions of stars which crowd the profundities of the\r\nMilky Way and other regions of the heavens--of the thousands of Nebulæ\r\nor starry systems which are dispersed throughout the immensity of the\r\nfirmament, and many other objects of sublimity and grandeur, which fill\r\nthe contemplative mind with admiration and awe, and raise its faculties\r\nto higher conceptions than it could otherwise have formed of the\r\nomnipotence and grandeur of the Almighty Creator.\r\n\r\nWithout this property of the rays of light we should likewise have\r\nwanted the use of the microscope--an instrument which has disclosed a\r\nworld invisible to common eyes, and has opened to our view the most\r\nastonishing exhibitions of Divine mechanism, and of the wisdom and\r\nintelligence of the Eternal Mind. We should have been ignorant of\r\nthose tribes of living beings, invisible to the unassisted eye, which\r\nare found in water, vinegar, and many other fluids--many of which are\r\ntwenty thousand times smaller than the least visible point, and yet\r\ndisplay the same admirable skill and contrivance in their construction,\r\nas are manifested in the formation of the larger animals. We should\r\nnever have beheld the purple tide of life, and even the globules of the\r\nblood rolling with swiftness through veins and arteries smaller than\r\nthe finest hair; or had the least conception that numberless species\r\nof animated beings, so minute that a million of them are less than\r\na grain of sand, could have been rendered visible to human eyes, or\r\nthat such a number of vessels, fluids, movements, diversified organs\r\nof sensation, and such a profusion of the richest ornaments and the\r\ngayest colours could have been concentrated in a single point. We\r\nshould never have conceived that even the atmosphere is replenished\r\nwith invisible animation, that the waters abound with countless myriads\r\nof sensitive existence, that the whole earth is full of life, and\r\nthat there is scarcely a tree, plant, or flower, but affords food and\r\nshelter to a species of inhabitants peculiar to itself, which enjoy\r\nthe pleasures of existence and share in the bounty of the Creator. We\r\ncould have formed no conception of the beauties and the varieties of\r\nmechanism which are displayed in the scenery of that invisible world\r\nto which the microscope introduces us--beauties and varieties, in\r\npoint of ornament and delicate contrivance, which even surpass what is\r\nbeheld in the visible operations and aspect of nature around us. We\r\nfind joints, muscles, a heart, stomach, entrails, veins, arteries, a\r\nvariety of motions, a diversity of forms, and a multiplicity of parts\r\nand functions--in breathing atoms. We behold in a small fibre of a\r\npeacock’s feather, not more than one-eighth of an inch in length, a\r\nprofusion of beauties no less admirable than is presented by the whole\r\nfeather to the naked eye--a stem sending out multitudes of lateral\r\nbranches, each of which emits numbers of little sprigs, which consist\r\nof a multitude of bright shining globular parts, adorned with a rich\r\nvariety of colours. In the sections of plants, we see thousands and\r\nten thousands of tubes and pores, and other vessels for the conveyance\r\nof air and juices for the sustenance of the plant; in some instances,\r\nmore than ten hundred thousand of these being compressed within the\r\nspace of a quarter of an inch in diameter, and presenting to the eye\r\nthe most beautiful configurations. There is not a weed, nor a moss, nor\r\nthe most insignificant vegetable, which does not show a multiplicity\r\nof vessels disposed in the most curious manner for the circulation of\r\nsap for its nourishment, and which is not adorned with innumerable\r\ngraces for its embellishment. All these and ten thousands of other\r\nwonders which lie beyond the limits of natural vision, in this new and\r\nunexplored region of the universe, would have been for ever concealed\r\nfrom our view, had not the Creator endued the rays of light with the\r\npower of _depicting the images of objects_, when refracted by convex\r\ntransparent substances.\r\n\r\nIn this instance, as well as in many others, we behold a specimen of\r\nthe admirable and diversified effects, which the Creator can produce\r\nfrom the agency of a single principle in nature. By means of optical\r\ninstruments, we are now enabled to take a more minute and expansive\r\nview of the amazing operations of nature, both in heaven and on earth,\r\nthan former generations could have surmised. These views tend to raise\r\nour conceptions of the attributes of that Almighty Being, who presides\r\nover all the arrangements of the material system, and to present them\r\nto our contemplation in a new, a more elevated, and expansive point of\r\nview. There is, therefore, a connection which may be traced between the\r\napparently accidental principle of the rays of light forming images of\r\nobjects, and the comprehensive views we are now enabled to take of the\r\ncharacter and perfections of the Divinity. Without the existence of the\r\nlaw or principle alluded to, we could not, in the present state, have\r\nformed precisely the same conceptions either of the Omnipotence, or of\r\nthe wisdom and intelligence of the Almighty. Had no microscope ever\r\nbeen invented, the idea never could have entered into the mind of man,\r\nthat worlds of living beings exist beyond the range of natural vision,\r\nthat organized beings possessed of animation exist, whose whole bulk\r\nis less than the ten hundred thousandth part of the smallest grain of\r\nsand; that, descending from a visible point to thousands of degrees\r\nbeyond it, an invisible world exists, peopled with tribes of every form\r\nand size, the extent of which, and how far it verges towards infinity\r\ndownwards, mortals have never yet explored, and perhaps will never be\r\nable to comprehend. This circumstance alone presents before us the\r\nperfections of the divinity in a new aspect, and plainly intimates that\r\nit is the will and the intention of the Deity, that we should explore\r\nhis works, and investigate the laws by which the material world is\r\nregulated, that we may acquire more expansive views of his character\r\nand operations. The inventions of man in relation to art and science,\r\nare not therefore to be considered as mere accidental occurrences, but\r\nas special arrangements in the divine government, for the purpose of\r\ncarrying forward the human mind to more clear and ample views of the\r\nscenes of the universe, and of the attributes and the agency of Him\r\n“who is wonderful in counsel and excellent in working.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE REFLECTION OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nThe _reflection_ of the rays of light is that property by which--after\r\napproaching the surfaces of bodies, they are thrown back, or repelled.\r\nIt is in consequence of this property that all the objects around\r\nus, and all the diversified landscapes on our globe, are rendered\r\nvisible. It is by light reflected from their surfaces that we perceive\r\nthe planetary bodies and their satellites, the belts of Jupiter, the\r\nrings of Saturn, the various objects which diversify the surface of\r\nthe Moon, and all the bodies in the universe which have no light of\r\ntheir own. When the rays of light fall upon rough and uneven surfaces,\r\nthey are reflected very irregularly and scattered in all directions,\r\nin consequence of which thousands of eyes, at the same time, may\r\nperceive the same objects, in all their peculiar colours, aspects,\r\nand relations. But, when they fall upon certain smooth and polished\r\nsurfaces, they are reflected with regularity, and according to certain\r\nlaws. Such surfaces, when highly polished, are called _Mirrors_ or\r\n_Speculums_; and it is to the reflection of light from such surfaces,\r\nand the effects it produces, that I am now to direct the attention of\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nMirrors or Specula, may be distinguished into three kinds, _plane_,\r\n_concave_, and _convex_, according as they are bounded by plane or\r\nspherical surfaces. These are made either of _metal_ or of _glass_,\r\nand have their surfaces highly polished for the purpose of reflecting\r\nthe greatest number of rays. Those made of glass are foliated or\r\nquicksilvered on one side; and the metallic specula are generally\r\nformed of a composition of different metallic substances, which,\r\nwhen accurately polished, is found to reflect the greatest quantity\r\nof light. I shall, in the first place, illustrate the phenomena of\r\nreflection produced by _plane-mirrors_.\r\n\r\nWhen light impinges, or falls, upon a polished flat surface,\r\nrather more than the half of it is reflected, or thrown back in a\r\ndirection similar to that of its approach; that is to say, if it fall\r\n_perpendicularly_ on the polished surface, it will be perpendicularly\r\nreflected; but if it fall _obliquely_, it will be reflected with\r\nthe same obliquity. Hence, the following fundamental law, regarding\r\nthe reflection of light, has been deduced both from experiment and\r\nmathematical demonstration, namely, that _the angle of reflection is,\r\nin all cases, exactly equal to the angle of incidence_. This is a law\r\nwhich is universal in all cases of reflection, whether it be from\r\nplane or spherical surfaces, or whether these surfaces be concave or\r\nconvex, and which requires to be recognized in the construction of all\r\ninstruments which depend on the reflection of the rays of light. The\r\nfollowing figure (fig. 14) will illustrate the position now stated.\r\n\r\nLet AB represent a plane mirror, and CD a line or ray of light\r\nperpendicular to it. Let FD represent the _incident_ ray from any\r\nobject, then DE will be the reflected ray, thrown back in the\r\ndirection from D to E, and it will make with the perpendicular CD the\r\nsame angle which the incident ray FD did with the same perpendicular,\r\nthat is, the angle FDC will be equal to the angle EDC, in all cases of\r\nobliquity. The incident ray of light may be considered as rebounding\r\nfrom the mirror, like a tennis ball from a marble pavement, or the wall\r\nof a court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 14._]\r\n\r\nIn viewing objects by reflection we see them in a different direction\r\nfrom that in which they really are, namely, along the line in which the\r\nrays come to us last. Thus, if AB (fig. 15) represent a plane mirror,\r\nthe image of an object C appears to the eye at E behind the mirror, in\r\nthe direction EG, and always in the intersection G of the perpendicular\r\nCG, and the reflected ray EG--and consequently at G as far behind\r\nthe mirror, as the object C is before it. We therefore see the image\r\nin the line EG, the direction in which the reflected rays proceed. A\r\nplane mirror does not alter the figure or size of objects; but the\r\nwhole image is equal and similar to the whole object, and has a like\r\nsituation with respect to one side of the plane, that the object has\r\nwith respect to the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 15._]\r\n\r\nMr. Walker illustrates the manner in which we see our faces in a mirror\r\nby the following figure (16). AB represents a mirror, and\r\nOC, a person looking into it. If we conceive a ray proceeding from\r\nthe forehead CE, it will be sent to the eye at O,\r\nagreeably to the angle of incidence and reflection. But the mind puts\r\nCEO into one line, and the forehead is seen at H,\r\nas if the lines CEO had turned on a hinge at E.--It\r\nseems a wonderful faculty of the mind to put the two oblique lines\r\nCE and OE into one straight line OH, yet\r\nit is seen every time we look at a mirror. For the ray has really\r\ntravelled from C to E, and from E to\r\nO, and it is that journey which determines the distance of the\r\nobject; and hence we see ourselves as far beyond the mirror as we stand\r\nfrom it. Though a ray is here taken only from one part of the face, it\r\nmay be easily conceived that rays from every other part of the face\r\nmust produce a similar effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 16._]\r\n\r\nIn every plain mirror, the image is always equal to the object, at what\r\ndistance soever it may be placed; and as the mirror is only at half\r\nthe distance of the image from the eye, it will completely receive an\r\nimage of _twice_ its own length. Hence a man six feet high may view\r\nhimself completely in a looking glass of three feet in length, and\r\nhalf his own breadth; and this will be the case at whatever distance\r\nhe may stand from the glass. Thus, the man AC (fig. 17) will see the\r\nwhole of his own image in the glass AB, which is but one half\r\nas large as himself. The rays from the head pass to the mirror in the\r\nline AA, perpendicular to the mirror, and are returned to the\r\neye in the same line; consequently, having travelled twice the length\r\nAA, the man must see his head at B. From his feet C rays\r\nwill be sent to the bottom of the mirror at B; these will be\r\nreflected at an equal angle to the eye in the direction BA, as\r\nif they had proceeded in the direction DBA, so that the man\r\nwill see his foot at D, and consequently his whole figure at BD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 17._]\r\n\r\nA person when looking into a mirror, will always see his own image as\r\nfar beyond the mirror as he is before it, and as he moves to or from\r\nit, the image will, at the same time, move towards or from him on the\r\nother side; but apparently with a double velocity, because the two\r\nmotions are equal and contrary. In like manner, if while the spectator\r\nis at rest, an object be in motion, its image behind the mirror will\r\nbe seen to move at the same time. And if the spectator moves, the\r\nimages of objects that are at rest will appear to approach, or recede\r\nfrom him, after the same manner as when he moves towards real objects;\r\nplane mirrors reflecting not only the object, but the distance also,\r\nand that exactly in its natural dimensions--The following principle is\r\nsufficient for explaining most of the phenomena seen in a plane mirror,\r\nnamely;--_That the image of an object seen in a plane mirror, is always\r\nin a perpendicular to the mirror joining the object and the image, and\r\nthat the image is as much on one side the mirror, as the object is on\r\nthe other_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reflection by Convex and Concave Mirrors._\r\n\r\nBoth convex and concave mirrors are formed of portions of a sphere.\r\nA convex speculum is ground and polished in a _concave_ dish or tool\r\nwhich is a portion of a sphere, and a concave speculum is ground upon\r\na convex tool. The inner surface of a sphere brings parallel rays\r\nto a focus at _one fourth_ of its diameter, as represented in the\r\nfollowing figure, where C is the centre of the sphere on which the\r\nconcave speculum AB is formed, and F the focus where parallel rays from\r\na distant object would be united, after reflection, that is, at one\r\nhalf the radius, or one fourth of the diameter from the surface of the\r\nspeculum. Were a speculum of this kind presented to the sun, F would\r\nbe the point where the reflected rays would be converged to a focus,\r\nand set fire to combustible substances if the speculum be of a large\r\ndiameter, and of a short focal distance. Were a candle placed in that\r\nfocus, its light would be reflected parallel as represented in the\r\nfigure. These are properties of concave specula which require to be\r\nparticularly attended to in the construction of reflecting telescopes.\r\nIt follows, from what has been now stated, that if we intend to form\r\na speculum of a certain focal distance,--for example, two feet, it is\r\nnecessary that _it should be ground upon a tool whose radius is double\r\nthat distance_, or four feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 18._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Properties of Convex Mirrors._\r\n\r\nFrom a convex surface, parallel rays when reflected are made to\r\ndiverge; convergent rays are reflected less convergent; and divergent\r\nrays are rendered more divergent. It is the nature of all convex\r\nmirrors and surfaces to scatter or _disperse_ the rays of light, and in\r\nevery instance to impede their convergence. The following figure shows\r\nthe course of parallel rays as reflected from a convex mirror. AEB is\r\nthe convex surface of the mirror; and KA, IE, LB, parallel rays falling\r\nupon it. These rays, when they strike the mirror, are made to diverge\r\nin the direction AG, BH, &c. and both the parallel and divergent rays\r\nare here represented as they appear in a dark chamber, when a convex\r\nmirror is presented to the solar rays. The dotted lines denote only the\r\ncourse or tendency of the reflected rays, towards the _virtual_ focus\r\nF, were they not intercepted by the mirror. This virtual focus is just\r\nequal to half the radius CE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 19._]\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the properties of convex mirrors: 1. The\r\nimage appears always erect, and behind the reflecting surface. 2. _The\r\nimage is always smaller than the object_, and the diminution is greater\r\nin proportion as the object is further from the mirror, but if the\r\nobject touch the mirror, the image at the point of contact is of the\r\nsame size as the object. 3. The image does not appear so far behind the\r\nreflecting surface as in a plain mirror. 4. The image of a straight\r\nobject, placed either parallel or oblique to the mirror is seen\r\n_curved_ in the mirror; because the different points of the object are\r\nnot all at an equal distance from the surface of the mirror. 5. Concave\r\nmirrors have a _real_ focus where an image is actually formed; but\r\nconvex specula have only a _virtual_ focus, and this focus is behind\r\nthe mirror; no image of any object being formed before it.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the purposes to which convex mirrors are\r\napplied. They are frequently employed by painters for reducing the\r\nproportions of the objects they wish to represent, as the images of\r\nobjects diminish in proportion to the smallness of the radius of\r\nconvexity, and to the distances of objects from the surface of the\r\nmirror. They form a fashionable part of modern furniture, as they\r\nexhibit a large company assembled in a room, with all the furniture it\r\ncontains, in a very small compass, so that a large hall with all its\r\nobjects, and even an extensive landscape, being reduced in size, may\r\nbe seen from one point of view. They are likewise used as the small\r\nspecula of those reflecting telescopes which are fitted up on the\r\n_Cassegrainian_ plan, and in the construction of Smith’s Reflecting\r\nMicroscope. But on the whole, they are very little used in the\r\nconstruction of optical instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Properties of Concave speculums._\r\n\r\nConcave specula have properties very different from those which are\r\nconvex; they are of more importance in the construction of reflecting\r\ntelescopes and other optical instruments; and therefore require more\r\nminute description and illustration. Concave mirrors cause parallel\r\nrays to converge; they increase the convergence of rays that are\r\nalready converging; they diminish the divergence of diverging rays;\r\nand, in some cases, render them parallel and even convergent; which\r\neffects are all in proportion to the concavity of the mirror. The\r\nfollowing figures show the course of diverging and parallel rays as\r\nreflected from concave mirrors.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 represents the course of _parallel_ rays, and AB, the concave\r\nmirror on which they fall. In this case, they are reflected so as to\r\nunite at F, which point is distant from its surface _one fourth_ of the\r\ndiameter of the sphere of the mirror. This point is called the focus of\r\nparallel rays, or _the true focus of the mirror_. And, since the sun\r\nbeams are parallel among themselves, if they are received on a concave\r\nmirror, they will all be reflected to that point, and there burn in\r\nproportion to the quantity of rays collected by the mirror. Fig. 21.\r\nshows the direction of _diverging_ rays, or those which proceed from\r\na near object. These rays proceeding from an object further from\r\nthe mirror than the true focal point, as from D to A and to B, are\r\nreflected converging and meet at a point F, _further from the mirror_\r\nthan the focal point of parallel rays. If the distance of the radiant,\r\nor object D, be equal to the radius CE, then will the focal distance\r\nbe likewise equal to the radius: That is, if an object be placed in\r\nthe center of a concave speculum, the image will be reflected upon the\r\nobject, or they will seem to meet and embrace each other in the centre.\r\nIf the distance of the radiant be equal to half the radius, its image\r\nwill be reflected to an infinite distance, for the rays will then be\r\nparallel. If, therefore, a luminous body be placed at half the radius\r\nfrom a concave speculum, it will enlighten places directly before it\r\nat great distances. Hence their use when placed behind a candle in a\r\ncommon lantern; hence their utility in throwing light upon objects in\r\nthe Magic Lantern and Phantasmagoria, and hence the vast importance\r\nof very large mirrors of this description, as now used in most of our\r\nLight Houses, for throwing a brilliant light to great distances at sea\r\nto guide the mariner when directing his course under the cloud of night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 20._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 21._]\r\n\r\nWhen _converging_ rays fall upon a concave mirror, they are reflected\r\nmore converging and unite at a point between the focus of parallel rays\r\nand the mirror; that is, nearer the mirror than one half the radius;\r\nand their precise degree of convergency will be greater than that\r\nwherein they converged before reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the images formed by Concave Mirrors._\r\n\r\nIf rays proceeding from a distant object fall upon a concave speculum,\r\nthey will paint an image or representation of the object on its focus\r\n_before_ the mirror. This image will be inverted, because the rays\r\ncross at the points where the image is formed. We have already seen\r\nthat a convex glass forms an image of an object _behind_ it; the rays\r\nof light from objects _pass through_ the glass, and the picture is\r\nformed on the side farthest from the object. But in concave mirrors\r\nthe images of distant objects--and of all objects that are farther\r\nfrom its surface than its principal focus--are formed _before_ the\r\nmirror, or on the same side as the object. In almost every other\r\nrespect, however, the effect of a concave mirror is the same as that\r\nof a convex lens, in regard to the formation of images, and the course\r\npursued by the rays of light, except that the effect is produced in the\r\none case by refraction, and in the other by reflection. The following\r\nfigure represents the manner in which images are formed by concave\r\nmirrors. GF represents the reflecting surface of the mirror; OAB, the\r\nobject; and IAM, the image formed by the mirror. The rays\r\nproceeding from O, will be carried to the mirror, in the direction OG,\r\nand according to the law that the angle of incidence is equal to the\r\nangle of reflection, will be reflected to I, in the direction GI. In\r\nlike manner the rays from B, will be reflected from F to M, the rays\r\nfrom A, will be reflected to a, and so of all the intermediate rays, so\r\nthat an inverted image of the object OB, will be formed at IM. If the\r\nrays proceeded from objects at a very great distance the image would be\r\nformed in the real focus of the mirror, or at one-fourth the diameter\r\nof the sphere from its surface; but near objects, which send forth\r\ndiverging rays, will have their images formed a little farther from the\r\nsurface of the mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 22._]\r\n\r\nIf we suppose a real object placed at IM, then OB will represent its\r\nmagnified image, which will be larger than the object, in proportion to\r\nits distance from the mirror. This may be experimentally illustrated\r\nby a concave mirror and a candle. Suppose a concave mirror whose focal\r\ndistance is five inches, and that a candle is placed before it, at\r\na little beyond its focus, (as at IM)--suppose at five and a half\r\ninches,--and that a wall or white screen receives the image, at the\r\ndistance of five feet six inches from the mirror, an image of the\r\ncandle will be formed on the wall which will be twelve times longer\r\nand broader than the candle itself. In this way concave mirrors may be\r\nmade to magnify the images of objects to an indefinite extent. This\r\nexperiment is an exact counterpart of what is effected in similar\r\ncircumstances by a convex lens, as described p. 74; the mirror\r\nperforming the same thing by reflection, as the lens did by refraction.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated in relation to concave mirrors it will be\r\neasily understood how they make such powerful burning-glasses. Suppose\r\nthe focal distance of a concave mirror to be twelve inches, and its\r\ndiameter or breadth twelve inches. When the sun’s rays fall on such\r\na mirror, they form an image of the sun at the focal point whose\r\ndiameter is found to be about one-tenth of an inch. All the rays\r\nwhich fall upon the mirror are converged into this small point; and\r\nconsequently their intensity is in proportion as the square of the\r\nsurface of the mirror is to the square of the image. The squares of\r\nthese diameters are as 14,400 to 1; and consequently the density of the\r\nsun’s rays, in the focus, is to their density on the surface of the\r\nmirror as 14,400 to 1. That is, the heat of the solar rays in the focus\r\nof such a mirror will be fourteen thousand four hundred times greater\r\nthan before--a heat which is capable of producing very powerful effects\r\nin melting and setting fire to substances of almost every description.\r\n\r\nWere we desirous of forming an image by a concave speculum which shall\r\nbe exactly equal to the object, the object must be placed exactly in\r\nthe centre; and, by an experiment of this kind, the centre of the\r\nconcavity of a mirror may be found.\r\n\r\nIn the cases now stated, the images of objects are all formed in the\r\nfront of the mirror, or between it and the object. But there is a case\r\nin which the image is formed behind the mirror. This happens when the\r\nobject is placed between the mirror and the focus of parallel rays,\r\nand then the image is larger than the object. In fig. 23, GF is a\r\nconcave mirror, whose focus of parallel rays is at E. If an object OB\r\nbe placed a little within this focus, as at A, a large image IM will\r\nbe seen _behind_ the mirror, somewhat curved and erect, which will be\r\nseen by an eye looking directly into the front of the mirror. Here\r\nthe image appears at a greater distance behind the mirror than the\r\nobject is before it, and the object appears magnified in proportion\r\nto its distance from the focus and the mirror. If the mirror be one\r\ninch focal distance, and the object be placed eight-tenths of an inch\r\nfrom its surface, the image would be five times as large as the object\r\nin length and breadth, and consequently twenty-five times larger in\r\nsurface. In this way small objects may be magnified by reflection, as\r\nsuch objects are magnified by refraction, in the case of deep convex\r\nlenses. When such mirrors are large, for example six inches diameter,\r\nand eight or ten inches focal distance, they exhibit the human face\r\nas of an enormous bulk. This is illustrated by the following figure.\r\nLet C N, Fig. 24, represent the surface of a concave mirror,\r\nand A a human face looking into it, the face will appear magnified\r\nas represented by the image behind the mirror D Q. Suppose\r\na ray A C proceeding from the forehead, and another M\r\nN from the chin; these rays are reflected to the person’s eye\r\nat O, which consequently sees the image in the lines of\r\nreflection O D, O Q, and in the angle D O\r\nQ, and consequently magnified much beyond the natural size, and at\r\na small distance behind the mirror.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 23._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 24._]\r\n\r\nIf we suppose the side T U to represent a _convex_ mirror,\r\nand the figure D Q a head of an ordinary size, then the\r\nfigure A will represent the diminished appearance which a person’s\r\nface exhibits, when viewed in such a mirror. It will not only appear\r\nreduced, but somewhat distorted; because from the form of the mirror,\r\none part of the object is nearer to it than another, and consequently\r\nwill be reflected under a different angle.\r\n\r\nThe effect we have now mentioned as produced by _concave_ mirrors,\r\nwill only take place when the eye is nearer the mirror than its\r\nprincipal focus. If the spectator retire beyond this focus--suppose to\r\nthe distance of five or six feet, he will not see the image _behind_\r\nthe mirror; but he will see his image in a diminished form, hanging\r\nupside down, and suspended in the air, in a line between his eye and\r\nthe mirror. In this case, his image is formed _before_ the mirror as\r\nrepresented at IM fig. 22. In this situation, if you hold out your hand\r\ntowards the mirror, the hand of the image will come out towards your\r\nhand, and, when at the centre of concavity, it will be of an equal size\r\nwith it, and you may shake hands with this aerial image. If you move\r\nyour hand farther, you will find the hand of the image pass by your\r\nhand, and come between it and your body. If you move your hand towards\r\neither side, the hand of the image will move towards the other side;\r\nthe image moving always in a contrary direction to the object. All\r\nthis while the by-standers, if any, see nothing of the image, because\r\nnone of the reflected rays that form it can enter their eyes.--The\r\nfollowing figure represents a phenomenon produced in the same manner.\r\nA B is a concave mirror of a large size; C represents\r\na hand presented before the mirror, at a point farther distant than\r\nits focus. In this case, an inverted image of the hand is formed which\r\nis seen hanging in the air at M. The rays C and\r\nD go diverging from the two opposite points of the object, and\r\nby the action of the mirror, they are again made to converge to points\r\nat O and S where they cross, form an image, and again\r\nproceed divergent to the eye.[10]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 25._]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the properties of concave mirrors, now described,\r\nmany curious experiments and optical deceptions have been exhibited.\r\nThe appearance of images in the air, suspended between the mirror and\r\nthe object, have sometimes been displayed with such dexterity and an\r\nair of mystery, as to have struck with astonishment those who were\r\nignorant of the cause. In this way birds, flying angels, spectres and\r\nother objects have been exhibited, and when the hand attempts to lay\r\nhold on them, it finds them to be nothing, and they seem to vanish\r\ninto air. An apple or a beautiful flower is presented, and when a\r\nspectator attempts to touch it, it instantly vanishes, and a death’s\r\nhead immediately appears, and seems to snap at his fingers. A person\r\nwith a drawn sword appears before him, in an attitude as if about to\r\nrun him through, or one terrific phantom starts up after another, or\r\nsometimes the resemblances of deceased persons are made to appear, as\r\nif, by the art of conjuration, they had been forced to return from the\r\nworld of spirits. In all such exhibitions, a very large concave mirror\r\nis requisite, a brilliant light must be thrown upon the objects, and\r\nevery arrangement is made, by means of partitions, &c., to prevent\r\neither the light, the mirror, or the object from being seen by the\r\nspectators. The following representation (fig. 26.) shows one of the\r\nmethods by which this is effected: A is a large concave\r\nmirror, either of metal or of glass, placed on the back part of a dark\r\nbox, D is the performer, concealed from the spectators by\r\nthe cross partition C; E is a strong light, which\r\nis likewise concealed by the partition I, which is thrown\r\nupon the actor D, or upon any thing he may hold in his hand.\r\nIf he hold a book, as represented in the figure, the light reflected\r\nfrom it will pass between the partitions C and I to\r\nthe mirror, and will be reflected from thence to Z, where\r\nthe image of the book will appear so distinct and tangible, that a\r\nspectator looking through the opening at X, will imagine that it is in\r\nhis power to take hold of it. In like manner, the person situated at\r\nD, may exhibit his own head or body--a portrait, a painting,\r\na spectre, a landscape, or any object or device which he can strongly\r\nilluminate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 26._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 27._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 28._]\r\n\r\nThere is another experiment, made with a concave mirror, which has\r\nsomewhat puzzled philosophers to account for the phenomena. Take a\r\nglass bottle AC, (fig. 27) and fill it with water to the point B;\r\nleave the upper part BC empty, and cork it in the common manner. Place\r\nthis bottle opposite a concave mirror, and beyond its focus, that\r\nit may appear reversed, and, before the mirror place yourself still\r\nfurther distant from the bottle, and it will appear in the situation\r\nA B C. Now, it is remarkable in this apparent bottle, that\r\nthe _water_, which, according to the laws of catoptrics, should\r\nappear at A B, appears on the contrary at B C, and\r\nconsequently, the part A B appears empty. If the bottle be\r\ninverted and placed before the mirror, its image will appear in its\r\nnatural erect position, and the water which is in reality at BC (fig.\r\n28) is seen at A B. If while the bottle is inverted, it be\r\nuncorked, and the water run gently out, it will appear, that, while the\r\npart BC is _emptying_, that of A B in the image is filling,\r\nand, what is remarkable, as soon as the bottle is empty, the illusion\r\nceases, the image also appearing entirely empty.--The remarkable\r\ncircumstances in this experiment are, first, not only to see the object\r\nwhere it is not, but also where its _image_ is not; and secondly, that\r\nof two objects which are really in the same place, as the surface of\r\nthe bottle and the water it contains, the one is seen at one place, and\r\nthe other at another; and to see the bottle in the place of its image,\r\nand the water where neither it nor its image are.\r\n\r\nThe following experiments are stated by Mr. Ferguson in his “Lectures\r\non select Subjects,” &c. “If a fire be made in a large room, and a\r\nsmooth mahogany table be placed at a good distance near the wall,\r\nbefore a large concave mirror, so placed that the light of the fire may\r\nbe reflected from the mirror to its focus upon the table; if a person\r\nstand by the table, he will see nothing upon it but a longish beam of\r\nlight: but if he stand at a distance toward the fire, not directly\r\nbetween the fire and mirror, he will see an image of the fire upon the\r\ntable, large and erect. And if another person who knows nothing of\r\nthe matter beforehand should chance to come into the room, and should\r\nlook from the fire toward the table, he would be startled at the\r\nappearance; for the table would seem to be on fire, and by being near\r\nthe wainscot, to endanger the whole house. In this experiment there\r\nshould be no light in the room but what proceeds from the fire; and the\r\nmirror ought to be at least fifteen inches in diameter. If the fire be\r\ndarkened by a screen, and a large candle be placed at the back of the\r\nscreen, a person standing by the candle will see the appearance of a\r\nvery fine large star, or rather planet, upon the table, as bright as\r\nVenus or Jupiter. And if a small wax taper--whose flame is much less\r\nthan the flame of the candle--be placed near the candle, a satellite to\r\nthe planet will appear on the table; and if the taper be moved round\r\nthe candle, the satellite will go round the planet.”\r\n\r\nMany other illustrations of the effects of concave specula might have\r\nbeen given, but I shall conclude this department by briefly stating\r\nsome of the _general properties of speculums_.\r\n\r\n1. There is a great resemblance between the properties of _convex_\r\nlenses and _concave_ mirrors. They both form an inverted focal image\r\nof any remote object, by the convergence of the pencil of rays. In\r\nthose instruments whose performances are the effects of reflection, as\r\nreflecting telescopes, the concave mirror is substituted in the place\r\nof the convex lens. The whole effect of these instruments, in bringing\r\nto view remote objects in heaven and on earth, entirely depends on the\r\nproperty of a concave mirror in forming _images_ of objects in its\r\nfocus. 2. The image of an object placed beyond the centre, is less\r\nthan the object; if the object be placed between the principal focus\r\nand the centre, the image is greater than the object. In both cases\r\nthe image is inverted. 3. When the object is placed between the focus\r\nand the mirror, the image situated _behind_ the mirror is greater\r\nthan the object, and it has the same direction: in proportion as the\r\nobject approaches the focus, the image becomes larger and more distant.\r\nThese and similar results are proved by placing a lighted candle at\r\ndifferent distances from a concave mirror. 4. An eye cannot see an\r\nimage in the air except it be placed in the diverging rays; but if the\r\nimage be received on a piece of white paper, it may be seen in any\r\nposition of the eye, as the rays are then reflected in every direction.\r\n5. If a picture drawn according to the rules of perspective, be placed\r\nbefore a large concave speculum, a little nearer than its principal\r\nfocus, the image of the picture will appear extremely natural, and\r\nvery nearly like the real objects whence it was taken. Not only are\r\nthe objects considerably magnified, so as to approach to their natural\r\nsize, but they have also different apparent distances, as in nature, so\r\nthat the view of the inside of a church appears very like what it is\r\nin reality, and representations of landscapes appear very nearly, as\r\nthey do from the spot whence they were taken. In this respect a large\r\nconcave speculum may be made to serve nearly the same purpose, as the\r\nOptical Diagonal Machine, in viewing perspective prints. 6. The concave\r\nspeculum is that alone which is used as the great mirror which forms\r\nthe first image in reflecting telescopes; and it is likewise the only\r\nkind of speculum used as the small mirror, in that construction of the\r\ninstrument called the _Gregorian Reflector_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Quantity of light reflected by polished surfaces._\r\n\r\nAs this is a circumstance connected with the construction of reflecting\r\ntelescopes, it may not be improper, in this place, to state some\r\nof the results of the accurate experiments of M. Bonguer on this\r\nsubject. This philosopher ascertained that of the light reflected from\r\nmercury, or quicksilver, more than _one-fourth_ is lost, though it is\r\nprobable that no substances reflect more light than this. The rays\r\nwere received at an angle of eleven and a half degrees of incidence,\r\nmeasured from the surface of the reflecting body, and not from the\r\nperpendicular. The reflection from _water_ was found to be almost\r\nas great as that of quicksilver; so that in very small angles it\r\nreflects nearly three-fourths of the direct light. This is the reason\r\nwhy so strong a reflection appears on water, when one walks, in still\r\nweather, on the brink of a lake opposite to the sun. The direct light\r\nof the sun diminishes gradually as it approaches the horizon, while\r\nthe reflected light at the same time grows stronger; so that there\r\nis a certain elevation of the sun in which the united force of the\r\ndirect and reflected light will be the greatest possible, and this is\r\nwhen he is twelve or thirteen degrees in altitude. On the other hand,\r\nlight reflected from water at _great angles_ of incidence is extremely\r\nsmall. When the light was perpendicular, it reflected no more than the\r\nthirty-seventh part which mercury does in the same circumstances, and\r\nonly the fifty-fifth part of what fell upon it in this case.\r\n\r\nUsing a smooth piece of glass, one line in thickness, he found that,\r\nwhen it was placed at an angle of fifteen degrees with the incident\r\nrays, it reflected 628 parts of 1000 which fell upon it; at the same\r\ntime, a metallic mirror which he tried in the same circumstances,\r\nreflected only 561 of them. At a less angle of incidence much more\r\nlight was reflected; so that at an angle of three degrees, the glass\r\nreflected 700 parts, and the metal something less, as in the former\r\ncase. The most striking observations made by this experimenter relate\r\nto the very great difference in the quantity of light reflected at\r\ndifferent angles of incidence. He found that for 1000 incident rays,\r\nthe reflected rays, at different angles of incidence, were as follows.\r\n\r\n  Angles of           Rays reflected          Rays reflected\r\n  incidence             by water                by glass\r\n\r\n     5°                   501                     549\r\n    10                    333                     412\r\n    15                    211                     299\r\n    30                     65                     112\r\n    50                     22                      34\r\n    70                     18                      25\r\n    90                     18                      25\r\n\r\nWith regard to such mirrors as the specula of reflecting telescopes, it\r\nwill be found, in general, that they reflect little more than the _one\r\nhalf_ of the rays which fall upon them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Uncommon appearances in nature produced by the combined influences of\r\nReflection and Refraction._\r\n\r\nThe reflection and refraction of the rays of light frequently produce\r\nphenomena which astonish the beholders, and which have been regarded\r\nby the ignorant and the superstitious, as the effects of supernatural\r\nagency. Of these phenomena I shall state a few examples.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking appearances of this kind is what has been\r\ntermed the _Fata Morgana_, or optical appearances of figures in the\r\nsea and the air, as seen in the Faro of Messina. The following account\r\nis translated from a work of Minasi, who witnessed the phenomenon, and\r\nwrote a dissertation on the subject. “When the rising sun shines from\r\nthat point whence its incident ray forms an angle of about forty-five\r\ndegrees to the sea of Riggio, and the bright surface of the water\r\nin the bay is not disturbed either by the wind or the current, the\r\nspectator being placed on an eminence of the city, with his back to the\r\nsun and his face to the sea;--on a sudden there appear on the water,\r\nas in a catoptric theatre, various multiplied objects, that is to\r\nsay, numberless series of pilasters, arches, castles well delineated,\r\nregular columns, lofty towers, superb palaces, with balconies and\r\nwindows, extended alleys of trees, delightful plains with herds and\r\nflocks, armies of men on foot and horseback, and many other strange\r\nimages, in their natural colours and proper actions, passing rapidly in\r\nsuccession along the surface of the sea, during the whole of the short\r\nperiod of time, while the above mentioned causes remain.--But, if in\r\naddition to the circumstances now described, the atmosphere be highly\r\nimpregnated with vapour and dense exhalations, not previously dispersed\r\nby the winds or the sun, it then happens that, in this vapour, as in\r\na curtain extended along the channel, at the height of about thirty\r\npalms, and nearly down to the sea, the observer will behold the scene\r\nof the same objects, not only reflected from the surface of the sea,\r\nbut likewise in the air, though not so distant or well defined, as the\r\nformer objects from the sea.--Lastly, if the air be slightly hazy or\r\nopake, and at the same time dewy and adapted to form the iris, the then\r\nabove-mentioned objects will appear only at the surface of the sea, as\r\nin the first case, but all vividly coloured or fringed with red, green,\r\nblue and other prismatic colours.”[11]\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to account for all the appearances here\r\ndescribed; but, in all probability, they are produced by a calm sea,\r\nand one or more strata of superincumbent air differing in refractive\r\nand consequently in reflective power. At any rate reflection and\r\nrefraction are some of the essential causes which operate in the\r\nproduction of the phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe _Mirage_, seen in the deserts of Africa, is a phenomenon, in all\r\nprobability produced by a similar cause. M. Monge, who accompanied\r\nthe French army to Egypt, relates that, when in the desert between\r\nAlexandria and Cairo, the mirage of the blue sky was inverted, and\r\nso mingled with the sand below, as to give to the desolate and arid\r\nwilderness an appearance of the most rich and beautiful country. They\r\nsaw, in all directions, green islands, surrounded with extensive lakes\r\nof pure, transparent water. Nothing could be conceived more lovely and\r\npicturesque than the landscape. In the tranquil surface of the lakes,\r\nthe trees and houses with which the islands were covered, were strongly\r\nreflected with vivid and varied hues, and the party hastened forward to\r\nenjoy the cool refreshments of shade and stream which these populous\r\nvillages proffered to them. When they arrived, the lake on whose bosom\r\nthey floated, the trees among whose foliage they were embowered, and\r\nthe people who stood on the shore inviting their approach, had all\r\nvanished, and nothing remained but an uniform and irksome desert of\r\nsand and sky, with a few naked huts and ragged Arabs. Had they not been\r\nundeceived by their nearer approach, there was not a man in the French\r\narmy who would not have sworn that the visionary trees and lakes had a\r\nreal existence in the midst of the desert.\r\n\r\nDr. Clark observed precisely the same appearances at Rosetta. The city\r\nseemed surrounded with a beautiful sheet of water; and so certain was\r\nhis Greek interpreter--who was unacquainted with the country--of this\r\nfact, that he was quite indignant at an Arab who attempted to explain\r\nto him that it was a mere optical delusion. At length they reached\r\nRosetta in about two hours, without meeting with any water; and on\r\nlooking back on the sand they had just crossed, it seemed to them as if\r\nthey had waded through a vast blue lake.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 29._]\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of August, 1798, Dr. Vince observed at Ramsgate a ship which\r\nappeared as at A, (fig. 29.) the topmast being the only part\r\nof it that was seen above the horizon. An inverted image of it was seen\r\nat B, immediately above the real ship A, and an erect\r\nimage at C, both of them being complete and well defined.\r\nThe sea was distinctly seen between them, as at V W. As the\r\nship rose to the horizon the image C gradually disappeared,\r\nand while this was going on, the image B descended, but the\r\nmainmast of B did not meet the mainmast of A. The\r\ntwo images BC were perfectly visible when the whole ship was\r\nactually below the horizon. Dr. Vince then directed his telescope to\r\nanother ship whose hull was just in the horizon, and he observed a\r\ncomplete inverted image of it, the mainmast of which just touched the\r\nmainmast of the ship itself. He saw at the same time several other\r\nships whose images appeared in nearly a similar manner, in one of\r\nwhich the two images were visible when the whole ship was beneath the\r\nhorizon. These phenomena must have been produced by the same causes\r\nwhich operated in the case formerly mentioned, in relation to Captain\r\nScoresby, when he saw the figure of his father’s ship inverted in the\r\ndistant horizon. Such cases are, perhaps not uncommon, especially in\r\ncalm and sultry weather, but they are seldom observed, except when a\r\nperson’s attention is accidentally directed to the phenomenon, and,\r\nunless he use a telescope, it will not be so distinctly perceived.\r\n\r\nThe following phenomenon, of a description nearly related to the above,\r\nhas been supposed to be chiefly owing to _reflection_. On the 18th\r\nof November, 1804, Dr. Buchan, when watching the rising sun, about\r\na mile to the east of Brighton, just as the solar disk emerged from\r\nthe surface of the water, saw the face of the cliff on which he was\r\nstanding, a windmill, his own figure and the figure of his friend,\r\ndistinctly represented, precisely opposite, at some distance from the\r\nocean. This appearance lasted about ten minutes, till the sun had\r\nrisen nearly his own diameter above the sea. The whole then seemed to\r\nbe elevated into the air and successively disappeared. The surface of\r\nthe sun was covered with a dense fog of many yards in height, which\r\ngradually receded from the rays of the sun as he ascended from the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nThe following appearance most probably arose chiefly from the\r\n_refraction_ of the atmosphere. It was beheld at Ramsgate, by Dr.\r\nVince of Cambridge and another gentleman. It is well known that\r\nthe four turrets of Dover castle are seen at Ramsgate, over a hill\r\nwhich intervenes between a full prospect of the whole. On the 2nd of\r\nAugust, 1806, not only were the four turrets visible, but the castle\r\nitself appeared as though situated on that side of the hill nearest\r\nRamsgate, and so striking was the appearance, that for a long time the\r\nDoctor thought it an illusion; but at last, by accurate observation,\r\nwas convinced that it was an actual image of the castle. He, with\r\nanother individual, observed it attentively for twenty minutes, but\r\nwere prevented by rain from making further observations. Between the\r\nobservers and the land from which the hill rises, there were about six\r\nmiles of sea, and from thence to the top of the hill there was about\r\nthe same distance, their own height above the surface of the water was\r\nabout seventy feet.--The cause of this phenomenon was, undoubtedly,\r\n_unequal refraction_. The air being more dense near the ground and\r\nabove the sea than at greater heights, reached the eye of the observer,\r\nnot in straight but in curvilinear lines. If the rays from the castle\r\nhad in their path struck an eye at a much greater distance than\r\nRamsgate, the probability is, that the image of the castle would have\r\nbeen inverted in the air; but in the present case,the rays from the\r\nturret and the base of the castle had not crossed each other.\r\n\r\nTo similar causes as those now alluded to are to be attributed such\r\nphenomena as the following:\r\n\r\n_The Spectre of the Brocken._ This is a wonderful and, at first sight,\r\na terrific phenomenon, which is sometimes seen from the summit of one\r\nof the Hartz mountains in Hanover, which is about 3,300 feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea, and overlooks all the country fifteen miles round.\r\nFrom this mountain the most gigantic and terrific spectres have been\r\nseen, which have terrified the credulous, and gratified the curious, in\r\na very high degree. M. Hawé who witnessed this phenomenon, says, the\r\nsun rose about four o’clock, after he had ascended to the summit, in a\r\nserene sky, free of clouds; and about a quarter past five, when looking\r\nround to see if the sky continued clear, he suddenly beheld at a little\r\ndistance, a human figure of _a monstrous size_ turned towards him, and\r\nglaring at him. While gazing on this gigantic spectre, with a mixture\r\nof awe and apprehension, a sudden gust of wind nearly carried off his\r\nhat, and he clapt his hand to his head to detain it, when to his great\r\ndelight, the colossal spectre did the same. He changed his body into a\r\nvariety of attitudes,all which the spectre exactly imitated, and then\r\nsuddenly vanished without any apparent cause, and, in a short time as\r\nsuddenly appeared. Being joined by another spectator, after the first\r\nvisions had disappeared, they kept steadily looking for the aërial\r\nspectres, when two gigantic monsters suddenly appeared. These spectres\r\nhad been long considered as preternatural, by the inhabitants of the\r\nadjacent districts, and the whole country had been filled with awe\r\nand terror. Some of the lakes of Ireland are found to be susceptible\r\nof producing illusions, particularly the lake of _Killarney_. This\r\nromantic sheet of water is bounded on one side, by a semicircle of\r\nrugged mountains, and on the other by a flat morass; and the vapours\r\ngenerated in the marsh, and broken by the mountains, continually\r\nrepresent the most fantastic objects. Frequently men riding along\r\nthe shore are seen as if they were moving across the lake, which is\r\nsupposed to have given rise to the legend of O’Donougho, a magician who\r\nis said to be visible on the lake every May morning.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that most of those visionary appearances\r\nwhich have been frequently seen in the sky and in mountainous regions,\r\nare phantoms produced by the cause to which I am adverting, such as\r\narmies of footmen and horsemen, which some have asserted to have been\r\nseen in the air near the horizon. A well authenticated instance of this\r\nkind occurred in the Highlands of Scotland:--Mr. Wren of Wetton Hall,\r\nand D. Stricket his servant, in the year 1744, were sitting at the\r\ndoor of the house in a summer evening, when they were surprised to see\r\nopposite to them on the side of Sonterfell hill--a place so extremely\r\nsteep, that scarce a horse could _walk_ slowly along it--the figure of\r\na man with a dog pursuing several horses, all running at a most rapid\r\npace. Onwards they passed till at last they disappeared at the lower\r\nend of the Fell. In expectation of finding the man dashed to pieces by\r\nso tremendous a fall, they went early next morning and made a search,\r\nbut no trace of man or horse, or the prints of their feet on the turf\r\ncould be found. Sometime afterwards, about seven in the evening, on the\r\nsame spot, they beheld a troop of horsemen advancing in close ranks and\r\nat a brisk pace. The inmates of every cottage for a mile round beheld\r\nthe wondrous scene, though they had formerly ridiculed the story told\r\nby Mr. Wren and his servant, and were struck with surprise and fear.\r\nThe figures were seen for upwards of two hours, till the approach of\r\ndarkness rendered them invisible. The various evolutions and changes\r\nthrough which the troops passed were distinctly visible, and were\r\nmarked by all the observers. It is not improbable that these aërial\r\ntroopers were produced by the same cause which made the castle of Dover\r\nto appear on the side of the hill next to Ramsgate, and it is supposed\r\nthat they were the images of a body of rebels, on the other side of the\r\nhill, exercising themselves previous to the rebellion in 1745.[12]\r\n\r\nI shall mention only another instance of this description which lately\r\noccurred in France, and for a time caused a powerful sensation among\r\nall ranks. On Sunday the 17th of December, 1826, the clergy in the\r\nparish of Migné, in the vicinity of Poictiers, were engaged in the\r\nexercises of the Jubilee which preceded the festival of Christmas,\r\nand a number of persons to the amount of 3000 souls assisted in the\r\nservice. They had planted as part of the ceremony, a large cross,\r\ntwenty-five feet high, and painted red, in the open air beside the\r\nchurch. While one of the preachers, about five in the evening, was\r\naddressing the multitude, he reminded them of the miraculous cross\r\nwhich appeared in the sky to Constantine and his army, and the effect\r\nit produced--when suddenly a similar celestial cross appeared in the\r\nheavens just before the porch of the church about 200 feet above\r\nthe horizon, and 140 feet in length, and its breadth from three to\r\nfour feet, of a bright silver colour tinged with red. The curate\r\nand congregation fixed their wondering gaze upon this extraordinary\r\nphenomenon, and the effect produced on the minds of the assembly\r\nwas strong and solemn: they spontaneously threw themselves on their\r\nknees; and many, who had been remiss in their religious duties, humbly\r\nconfessed their sins, and made vows of penance and reformation. A\r\ncommission was appointed to investigate the truth of this extraordinary\r\nappearance, and a memorial stating the above and other facts was\r\nsubscribed by more than forty persons of rank and intelligence, so\r\nthat no doubt was entertained as to the reality of the phenomenon.\r\nBy many it was considered as strictly miraculous, as having happened\r\nat the time and in the circumstances mentioned. But it is evident,\r\nfrom what we have already stated, that it may be accounted for on\r\nphysical principles. The large cross of wood painted red was doubtless\r\nthe real object which produced the magnified image. The state of the\r\natmosphere, according to the descriptions given in the memorial, must\r\nhave been favourable for the production of such images. The spectrum\r\nof the wooden cross must have been cast on the concave surface of\r\nsome atmospheric mirror, and so reflected back to the eyes of the\r\nspectators, from an opposite place--retaining exactly the same shape\r\nand proportions, but dilated in size; and what is worthy of attention,\r\nit was tinged with red, the very colour of the object of which it was\r\nthe reflected image.\r\n\r\nSuch phenomena as we have now described, and the causes of them which\r\nscience is able to unfold, are worthy of consideration, in order to\r\ndivest the mind of superstitious terrors, and enable it clearly to\r\nperceive the laws by which the Almighty directs the movements of the\r\nmaterial system. When any appearance in nature, exactly the reverse\r\nof every thing we could have previously conceived--presents itself\r\nto view, and when we know of no material cause by which it could be\r\nproduced, the mind must feel a certain degree of awe and terror, and\r\nwill naturally resort to supernatural agency as acting either in\r\nopposition to the established laws of the universe, or beyond the range\r\nto which they are confined. Besides the fears and apprehensions to\r\nwhich such erroneous conceptions give rise, they tend to convey false\r\nand distorted impressions of the attributes of the Deity and of his\r\nmoral government. Science, therefore, performs an invaluable service to\r\nman, by removing the cause of superstitious alarms, by investigating\r\nthe laws and principles which operate in the physical system, and by\r\nassigning reasons for those occasional phenomena, which at first sight\r\nappeared beyond the range of the operation of natural causes.\r\n\r\nThe late ingenious Dr. Wollaston illustrated the causes of some of\r\nthe phenomena we have described, in the following manner. He looked\r\nalong the side of a red hot poker at a word or object ten or twelve\r\nfeet distant; and at a distance less than three eights of an inch from\r\nthe line of the poker, an _inverted_ image was seen, and within and\r\nwithout that image, an _erect_ image, in consequence of the change\r\nproduced, by the heat of the poker, in the density of the air. He also\r\nsuggested the following experiment as another illustration of the\r\nsame principle, namely, viewing an object through a stratum of spirit\r\nof wine lying above water, or a stratum of water laid above one of\r\nsyrup. He poured into a _square_ phial a small quantity of clear syrup,\r\nand above this he poured an equal quantity of _water_ which gradually\r\ncombined with the syrup, as seen at A. fig. 30. The word ‘Syrup,’ on\r\na card held behind the bottle, appeared erect when seen through the\r\npure spirit, but inverted, when seen through the mixture of water and\r\nsyrup. He afterwards put nearly the same quantity of rectified spirits\r\nof wine above the water, as seen at B, and he saw the appearance as\r\nrepresented, namely, the true place of the word ‘Spirit,’ and the\r\ninverted and erect images below. These substances, by their gradual\r\nincorporation, produce refracting power, diminishing from the _spirit\r\nof wine_ to the _water_, or from the _syrup_ to the _water_; so that by\r\nlooking through the mixed stratum, an inverted image of any object is\r\nseen behind the bottle. These experiments show that the _mirage_ and\r\nseveral other atmospherical phenomena may be produced by variations in\r\nthe refractive power of different strata of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 30._]\r\n\r\nIt is not unlikely that phenomena of a new and different description\r\nfrom any we have hitherto observed, may be produced from the same\r\ncauses to which we have adverted. A certain optical writer remarks--‘If\r\nthe variation of the refractive power of the air takes place in a\r\nhorizontal line perpendicular to the line of vision, that is, from\r\nright to left, then we may have a _lateral_ Mirage, that is, an image\r\nof a ship may be seen on the right or left hand of the real ship, or\r\non both, if the variation of refractive power is the same on each side\r\nof the line of vision, and a fact of this kind was once observed on\r\nthe Lake of Geneva. If there should happen at the same time, both a\r\nvertical and a lateral variation of refractive power in the air, and\r\nif the variation should be such as to expand or elongate the object in\r\nboth directions, then the object would be magnified as if seen through\r\na telescope, and might be seen and recognized at a distance at which it\r\nwould not otherwise have been visible. If the refracting power, on the\r\ncontrary, varied, so as to construct the object in both directions, the\r\nimage of it would be diminished as if seen through a concave lens.’\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks and Reflections, in reference to the phenomena described\r\nabove._\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are some of the striking and interesting effects\r\nproduced by the refraction and the reflection of the rays of light.\r\nAs the formation of the _images_ of objects by convex lenses, lays\r\nthe foundation of the construction of refracting telescopes and\r\nmicroscopes, and of all the discoveries they have brought to light, so\r\nthe property of _concave specula_, in forming similar images, is that\r\non which the construction of _Reflecting_ telescopes entirely depends.\r\nTo this circumstance Herschel was indebted for the powerful telescopes\r\nhe was enabled to construct--which were all formed on the principle of\r\nreflection--and for all the discoveries they enabled him to make in\r\nthe planetary system, and in the sidereal heavens. The same principles\r\nwhich operate in optical instruments, under the agency of man, we have\r\nreason to believe, frequently act on a more expansive scale in various\r\nparts of the system of nature. The magnificent _Cross_ which astonished\r\nthe preacher and the immense congregation assembled at Migné, was, in\r\nall probability, formed by a vast atmospherical speculum formed by the\r\nhand of nature, and representing its objects on a scale far superior to\r\nthat of human art; and probably, to the same cause is to be attributed\r\nthe singular phenomenon of the coast of France having been made to\r\nappear within two or three miles of the town of Hastings, as formerly\r\ndescribed, (see p. 53.) Many other phenomena which we have never\r\nwitnessed, and of which we can form no conception, may be produced by\r\nthe same cause operating in an infinity of modes.\r\n\r\nThe facts we have stated above, and the variety of modes by which light\r\nmay be refracted and reflected by different substances in nature,\r\nlead us to form some conceptions of the magnificent and diversified\r\nscenes which light may produce in other systems and worlds, under\r\nthe arrangements of the all-wise and Beneficent Creator. Light, in\r\nall its modifications and varieties of colour and reflection, may be\r\nconsidered as the beauty and glory of the universe, and the source\r\nof unnumbered enjoyments to all its inhabitants. It is a symbol of\r\nthe Divinity himself; for “GOD IS LIGHT, and in Him is no\r\ndarkness at all.” It is a representative of Him who is exhibited in\r\nthe Sacred oracles, as “The SUN of Righteousness,” and “the\r\nLIGHT of the world.” It is an emblem of the glories and\r\nfelicities of that future world, where knowledge shall be perfected,\r\nand happiness complete; for its inhabitants are designated “the saints\r\nin _light_;” and it is declared in Sacred history, to have been the\r\nfirst born of created beings. In our lower world, its effects on the\r\nobjects which surround us, and its influences upon all sensitive\r\nbeings, are multifarious and highly admirable. While passing from\r\ninfinitude to infinitude, it reveals the depth and immensity of\r\nthe heavens, the glory of the sun, the beauty of the stars, the\r\narrangements of the planets, the rainbow encompassing the sky with\r\nits glorious circle, the embroidery of flowers, the rich clothing of\r\nthe meadows, the valleys standing thick with corn, “the cattle on a\r\nthousand hills,” the rivers rolling through the plains, and the wide\r\nexpanse of the ocean. But in other worlds the scenes it creates may\r\nbe far more resplendent and magnificent. This may depend upon the\r\nrefractive and reflective powers with which the Creator has endowed\r\nthe atmospheres of other planets, and the peculiar constitution of the\r\nvarious objects with which they are connected. It is evident, from\r\nwhat we already know of the reflection of light, that very slight\r\nmodifications of certain physical principles, and very slight additions\r\nto the arrangements of our terrestrial system, might produce scenes of\r\nbeauty, magnificence and splendour of which, at present, we can form\r\nno conception. And, it is not unlikely that by such diversities of\r\narrangement, in other worlds, _an infinite variety_ of natural scenery\r\nis produced throughout the universe.\r\n\r\nIn the arrangements connected with the planet Saturn, and the immense\r\nrings with which it is encompassed, and in the various positions which\r\nits satellites daily assume with regard to one another, to the planet\r\nitself, and to these rings--there is, in all probability, a combination\r\nof refractions, reflections, light, and shadows, which produce scenes\r\nwonderfully diversified, and surpassing in grandeur what we can now\r\ndistinctly conceive. In the remote regions of the heavens, there are\r\ncertain bodies composed of immense masses of luminous matter, not yet\r\nformed into any regular system, and which are known by the name of\r\n_Nebulæ_. What should hinder us from supposing that certain exterior\r\nportions of those masses form speculums of enormous size, as some\r\nparts of our atmosphere are sometimes found to do? Such specula may\r\nbe conceived to be hundreds and even thousands of miles in diameter,\r\nand that they may form images of the most distant objects in the\r\nheavens, on a scale of immense magnitude and extent, and which may\r\nbe reflected, in all their grandeur, to the eyes of intelligences at\r\na vast distance. And, if the organs of vision of such beings, be far\r\nsuperior to ours in acuteness and penetrating power, they may thus be\r\nenabled to take a survey of an immense sphere of vision, and to descry\r\nmagnificent objects at distances the most remote from the sphere they\r\noccupy. Whatever grounds there may be for such suppositions, it must be\r\nadmitted, that all the knowledge we have hitherto acquired respecting\r\nthe operation of light, and the splendid effects it is capable of\r\nproducing, is small indeed, and limited to a narrow circle, compared\r\nwith the immensity of its range, the infinite modifications it may\r\nundergo, and the wondrous scenes it may create in regions of creation\r\nto which human eyes have never yet penetrated,--and which may present\r\nto view objects of brilliancy and magnificence such as, “Eye hath not\r\nyet seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to\r\nconceive.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.--ON THE COLOURS OF LIGHT.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered light chiefly as a simple homogeneous\r\nsubstance, as if all its rays were white, and as if they were all\r\nrefracted in the same manner by the different lenses on which they\r\nfall. Investigations however, into the nature of this wonderful\r\nfluid, have demonstrated that this is not the case, and that it is\r\npossessed of certain additional properties, of the utmost importance\r\nin the system of nature. Had every ray of light been a pure white, and\r\nincapable of being separated into any other colours, the scene of the\r\nuniverse would have exhibited a very different aspect from what we\r\nnow behold. One uniform hue would have appeared over the whole face\r\nof nature, and one object could scarcely have been distinguished from\r\nanother. The different shades of verdure which now diversify every\r\nlandscape, the brilliant colouring of the flowery fields, and almost\r\nall the beauties and sublimities which adorn this lower creation would\r\nhave been withdrawn. But it is now ascertained that every ray of white\r\nlight is composed of an assemblage of colours, whence proceed that\r\ninfinite variety of shade and colour with which the whole of our\r\nterrestrial habitation is arrayed. Those colours are found not to be\r\nin the objects themselves, but in the rays of light which fall upon\r\nthem, without which they would either be invisible, or wear an uniform\r\naspect. In reference to this point, Goldsmith has well observed: ‘The\r\nblushing beauties of the rose, the modest blue of the violet, are not\r\nin the flowers themselves, but in the light that adorns them. Odour,\r\nsoftness, and beauty of figure are their own; but it is light alone\r\nthat dresses them up in those robes which shame the monarch’s glory.’\r\n\r\nMany strange opinions and hypotheses were entertained respecting\r\ncolours, by the ancients, and even by many modern writers, prior to\r\nthe time of Sir Isaac Newton. The Pythagoreans called colour the\r\n_superficies_ of bodies; Plato said that it was a flame issuing from\r\nthem. According to Zeno it is the first configuration of matter,\r\nand according to Aristotle, it is that which moves bodies actually\r\ntransparent. Among the moderns, Des Cartes imagined that the difference\r\nof colour proceeds from the prevalence of the direct or rotatory\r\nmotions of the particles of light. Grimaldi, Dechales, and others,\r\nthought the differences of colour depended upon the quick or slow\r\nvibrations of a certain elastic medium filling the whole universe.\r\nRohault imagined that the different colours were made by the rays of\r\nlight entering the eye at different angles with respect to the optic\r\naxis; and Dr. Hook conceived that colour is caused by the sensation\r\nof the oblique or uneven pulse of light; and this being capable of\r\nno more than two varieties, he concluded that there could be no\r\nmore than two primary colours. Such were some of the crude opinions\r\nwhich prevailed before the era of the illustrious Newton, by whose\r\nenlightened investigations the true theory of colours was at last\r\ndiscovered. In the year 1666 this philosopher began to investigate the\r\nsubject; and finding the coloured image of the sun, formed by a glass\r\nprism, to be of an oblong and not of a circular form, as according to\r\nthe laws of refraction it ought to be, he was surprised at the great\r\ndisproportion between its length and breadth, the former being _five_\r\ntimes the length of the latter; and he began to conjecture that light\r\nis not _homogeneal_, but that it consists of rays some of which are\r\nmuch more refrangible than others. Prior to this period, philosophers\r\nsupposed that _all_ light, in passing out of one medium into another\r\nof different density was _equally_ refracted in the same or like\r\ncircumstances; but Newton discovered that this is not the fact; but\r\nthat there are _different species_ of light, and that each species is\r\ndisposed both to suffer a different degree of refrangibility in passing\r\nout of one medium into another,--and to excite in us the idea of a\r\n_different colour_ from the rest; and that bodies appear of that colour\r\nwhich arises from the peculiar rays they are disposed to reflect. It is\r\nnow, therefore, universally acknowledged, that the light of the sun,\r\nwhich to us seems perfectly homogeneal and white, is composed of no\r\nfewer than _seven_ different colours, namely _Red_, _Orange_, _Yellow_,\r\n_Green_, _Blue_, _Indigo and Violet_. A body which appears of a red\r\ncolour has the property of reflecting the red rays more powerfully\r\nthan any of the others; a body of a green colour reflects the green\r\nrays more copiously than rays of any other colour, and so of the\r\norange, yellow, blue, purple and violet. A body which is of a _black_\r\ncolour, instead of reflecting--_absorbs_ all, or the greater part of\r\nthe rays that fall upon it; and, on the contrary, a body that appears\r\n_white_ reflects the greater part of the rays indiscriminately without\r\nseparating the one from the other.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to describe the experiments by which the above\r\nresults were obtained, it may be proper to give some idea of the form\r\nand effects of the _Prism_ by which such experiments are made. This\r\ninstrument is triangular and straight, and generally about three or\r\nfour inches long. It is commonly made of white glass, as free as\r\npossible from veins and bubbles, and other similar defects, and is\r\nsolid throughout. Its lateral faces, or sides, should be perfectly\r\nplane and of a fine polish. The angle formed by the two faces, one\r\nreceiving the ray of light that is refracted in the instrument, and the\r\nother affording it an issue on its returning into the air, is called\r\nthe _refracting angle_ of the prism, as ACB, (fig. 31.) The manner in\r\nwhich Newton performed his experiments, and established the discovery\r\nto which we have alluded, is as follows.\r\n\r\nIn the window-shutter EG, (fig. 31.) of a dark room, a hole F, was\r\nmade, of about one third of an inch diameter, and behind it was\r\nplaced a glass prism ACB, so that the beam of light, SF, proceeding\r\ndirectly from the sun was made to pass through the prism. Before the\r\ninterposition of the prism, the beam proceeded in a straight line\r\ntowards T, where it formed a round white spot; but being now bent\r\nout of its course by the prism, it formed an oblong image OP, upon\r\nthe white pasteboard, or screen LM, containing the seven colours\r\nmarked in the figure--the _red_ being the _least_, and the _violet_\r\nthe _most_ refracted from the original direction of the solar beam,\r\nST. This oblong image is called the _prismatic spectrum_. If the\r\nrefracting angle of the prism ACB, be 64 degrees, and the distance\r\nof the pasteboard from the prism about 18 feet, the length of the\r\nimage OP will be about 10 inches, and the breadth 2 inches. The sides\r\nof the spectrum are right lines distinctly bounded, and the ends are\r\nsemicircular. From this circumstance it is evident that it is still\r\nthe image of the sun, but elongated by the refractive power of the\r\nprism. It is evident from the figure, that since some part of the\r\nbeam, RO, is refracted much further out of its natural course WT, than\r\nsome other part of the beam, as WP, the rays towards RO have a much\r\ngreater disposition to be refracted than those toward WP; and that this\r\ndisposition arises from the naturally different qualities of those\r\nrays, is evident from this consideration, that the refracting angle or\r\npower of the prism is the same in regard to the superior part of the\r\nbeam as to the inferior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 31._]\r\n\r\nBy making a hole in the screen LM opposite any one of the colours of\r\nthe spectrum, so as to allow that colour alone to pass--and by letting\r\nthe colour thus separated fall upon a second prism--Newton found that\r\nthe light of each of the colours was alike refrangible, because the\r\nsecond prism could not separate them into an oblong image, or into\r\nany other colour. Hence he called all the seven colours _simple_\r\nor homogeneous, in opposition to _white_ light, which he called\r\n_compound_ or heterogeneous. With the prism which this philosopher\r\nused he found the lengths of the colours and spaces of the spectrum\r\nto be as follows: Red, 45; Orange, 27; Yellow, 40; Green, 60; Blue,\r\n60; Indigo, 48; Violet, 80: or 360 in all. But these spaces vary a\r\nlittle with prisms formed of different substances, and as they are\r\nnot separated by distinct limits, it is difficult to obtain any thing\r\nlike an accurate measure of their relative extents. Newton examined\r\nthe ratio between the sines of incidence and refraction of these\r\ndecompounded rays (see p. 30,) and found that each of the seven primary\r\ncolour-making rays, had certain limits within which they were confined.\r\nThus let the sine of incidence in glass be divided into 50 equal\r\nparts, the sine of refraction into air of the _least_ refrangible,\r\nand the _most_ refrangible rays will contain respectively 77 and 78\r\nsuch parts. The sines of refraction of all the degrees of _red_ will\r\nhave the intermediate degrees of magnitude, from 77 to 77 one-eighth;\r\n_Orange_ from 77 one-eighth to 77 one-fifth; _Yellow_ from 77 one-fifth\r\nto 77 one-third; _Green_ from 77 one-third to 77 one-half; _Blue_\r\nfrom 77 one-half to 77 two-thirds; _Indigo_ from 77 two-thirds to 77\r\nseven-ninths; and _Violet_ from 77 seven-ninths to 78.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been now stated, it is evident that, in proportion as any\r\npart of an optic glass bears a resemblance to the form of a prism, the\r\ncomponent rays that pass through it must be necessarily separated, and\r\nwill consequently paint or tinge the object with colours. The edges of\r\nevery convex lens approach to this form, and it is on this account that\r\nthe extremities of objects when viewed through them are found to be\r\ntinged with the prismatic colours. In such a glass, therefore, those\r\ndifferent coloured rays will have _different foci_, and will form their\r\nrespective images at different distances from the lens. Thus, suppose\r\nLN (fig. 32.) to represent a double convex-lens, and OB an object at\r\nsome distance from it. If the object OB was of a pure red colour, the\r\nrays proceeding from it would form a red image at RR; if the\r\nobject was of a violet colour, an image of that colour would be formed\r\nat VV, _nearer_ the lens; and if the object was white or any\r\nother combination of the colour-making rays, those rays would have\r\ntheir respective foci at different distances from the lens, and form a\r\nsuccession of images, in the order of the prismatic colours, between\r\nthe space RR and VV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 32._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 33._]\r\n\r\nThis may be illustrated by experiment in the following manner. Take\r\na card or slip of white pasteboard, as ABEF, (fig. 33.) and paint\r\none half ABCD _red_, the other half CF, _violet_ or indigo; and tying\r\nblack threads across it, set it near the flame of a candle G, then\r\ntake a lens HI, and holding a sheet of white paper behind it, move it\r\nbackwards and forwards upon the edge of a graduated ruler, till you\r\nsee the black threads most distinctly in the image, and you will find\r\nthe focus of the violet FE, much nearer than that of the red\r\nAC, which plainly shows that bodies of different colours can\r\nnever be depicted by convex-lenses, without some degree of confusion.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of dispersion of the coloured rays in convex lenses\r\ndepends upon the focal length of the glass; the space which the\r\ncoloured images occupy being about the twenty-eighth part. Thus if\r\nthe lens be twenty-eight inches focal distance, the space between\r\nRR and VV (fig 32) will be about one inch; if it\r\nbe twenty-eight feet focus, the same space will be about one foot,\r\nand so on in proportion. Now, when such a succession of images formed\r\nby the different coloured rays, is viewed through an eye-glass, it\r\nwill seem to form but one image, and consequently very indistinct,\r\nand tinged with various colours, and as the red figure RR is\r\nlargest, or seen under the greatest angle--the extreme parts of this\r\nconfused image will be red, and a succession of the prismatic colours\r\nwill be formed within this red fringe, as is generally found in common\r\nrefracting-telescopes, constructed with a single object-glass. It is\r\nowing to this circumstance that the common refracting telescope cannot\r\nbe much improved without having recourse to lenses of a very long\r\nfocal distance; and hence, about 150 years ago, such telescopes were\r\nconstructed of 80, and 100, and 120 feet in length. But still the image\r\nwas not formed so distinctly as was desired, and the aperture of the\r\nobject-glass was obliged to be limited. This is a defect which was\r\nlong regarded as without a remedy; and even Newton himself despaired\r\nof discovering any means by which the defects of refracting telescopes\r\nmight be removed and their improvement effected. This, however, was\r\naccomplished by Dollond to an extent far surpassing what could have\r\nbeen expected, of which a particular account will be given in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\nIt was originally remarked by Newton, and the fact has since\r\nbeen confirmed by the experiments of Sir W. Herschel, that _the\r\ndifferent-coloured rays have not the same illuminating power_. The\r\nviolet rays appear to have the least illuminating effect; the indigo\r\nmore, and the effect increases in the order of the colours,--the\r\n_green_ being very great; between the green and the yellow the greatest\r\nof all; the yellow the same as the green; but the red less than the\r\nyellow. Herschel also endeavoured to determine whether the power of the\r\ndifferently-coloured rays to _heat_ bodies, varied with their power\r\nto illuminate them. He introduced a beam of light into a dark room,\r\nwhich was decomposed by a prism, and then exposed a very sensible\r\nthermometer to all the rays in succession, and observed the heights\r\nto which it rose in a given time. He found that their heating power\r\nincreased from the violet to the red. The mercury in the thermometer\r\nrose higher when its bulb was placed in the Indigo than when it was\r\nplaced in the violet, still higher in blue, and highest of all at red.\r\nUpon placing the bulb of the thermometer below the red, quite out of\r\nthe spectrum, he was surprised to find that the mercury rose highest\r\nof all; and concluded that _rays proceed from the sun, which have the\r\npower of_ HEATING, _but not of illuminating bodies_. These\r\nrays have been called _invisible_ solar rays. They were about half an\r\ninch from the commencement of the red rays; at a greater distance from\r\nthis point the heat began to diminish, but was very perceptible even\r\nat the distance of 1-1/2 inch. He determined that the heating power of\r\nthe _red_ to that of the _green_ rays, was 2-3/4 to 1, and 3-1/2 to 1,\r\nin red to _violet_. He afterwards made experiments to collect those\r\ninvisible calorific rays, and caused them to act independently of the\r\nlight, from which he concluded that they are sufficient to account\r\nfor all the effects produced by the solar rays in exciting heat; that\r\nthey are capable of passing through glass, and of being refracted and\r\nreflected, after they have been finally detached from the solar beam.\r\n\r\nM. Ritter of Jena, Wollaston, Beckman and others, have found\r\nthat the rays of the spectrum are possessed of certain _chemical\r\nproperties_--that beyond the least brilliant extremity, namely, a\r\nlittle beyond the _violet_ ray, there are _invisible_ rays which\r\nact chemically, while they have neither the power of heating nor\r\nilluminating bodies. Muriate of silver exposed to the action of the red\r\nrays becomes blackish; a greater effect is produced by the yellow: a\r\nstill greater by the violet, and the greatest of all by the _invisible_\r\nrays _beyond_ the violet. When phosphorus is exposed to the action\r\nof the invisible rays beyond the red, it emits white fumes; but the\r\ninvisible rays beyond the violet extinguish them. The influence of\r\nthese rays is daily seen in the change produced upon vegetable colours,\r\nwhich fade, when frequently exposed to the direct influence of the sum.\r\nWhat object they are destined to accomplish in the general economy of\r\nnature, is not yet distinctly known; we cannot however doubt that\r\nthey are essentially requisite to various processes going forward in\r\nthe material system. And we know that, not only the comfort of all\r\nthe tribes of the living world, but the very existence of the animal\r\nand vegetable creation depends upon the unremitting agency of the\r\n_Calorific_ rays.\r\n\r\nIt has likewise been lately discovered that certain rays of the\r\nspectrum, particularly the _violet, possesses the property of\r\ncommunicating the magnetic power_. Dr. _Morichini_, of Rome, appears to\r\nhave been the first who found that the violet rays of the spectrum had\r\nthis property. The result of his experiments, however, was involved in\r\ndoubt, till it was established by a series of experiments instituted by\r\nMrs. _Somerville_, whose name is so well known in the scientific world.\r\nThis lady having covered half of a sewing-needle, about an inch long,\r\nwith paper, she exposed the other half for two hours, to the violet\r\nrays. The needle had then acquired North polarity. The indigo rays\r\nproduced nearly the same effect; and the blue and green rays produced\r\nit in a still less degree. In the yellow, orange, red and invisible\r\nrays, no magnetic influence was exhibited, even though the experiment\r\nwas continued for three successive days. The same effects were produced\r\nby enclosing the needle in blue or green glass, or wrapping it in blue\r\nand green ribbands one half of the needle being always covered with\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious discoveries of modern times, in reference\r\nto the solar spectrum, is that of Fraunhofer of Munich--one of the\r\nmost distinguished artists and opticians on the Continent.[13] He\r\ndiscovered that the spectrum is covered with dark and coloured lines,\r\nparallel to one another, and perpendicular to the length of the\r\nspectrum; and he counted no less than 590 of these lines. In order\r\nto observe these lines, it is necessary to use prisms of the most\r\nperfect construction, of very pure glass, free of veins--to exclude\r\nall extraneous light, and even to stop those rays which form the\r\ncoloured spaces, which we are not examining. It is necessary also to\r\nuse a magnifying instrument, and the light must enter and emerge from\r\nthe prism at equal angles. One of the important practical results of\r\nthis discovery is, that those lines are fixed points in the spectrum,\r\nor rather, that they have always the same position in the coloured\r\nspaces in which they are found. Fraunhofer likewise discovered in the\r\nspectrum produced by the light of Venus, the same streaks, as in the\r\nsolar spectrum; in the spectrum of the light of Sirius, he perceived\r\nthree large streaks which, according to appearance, had no resemblance\r\nto those of the light of the sun; one of them was in the green, two\r\nin the blue. The stars appear to differ from one another in their\r\nstreaks. The electric light differs very much from the light of the sun\r\nand that of a lamp, in regard to the streaks of the spectrum--‘This\r\nexperiment may also be made, though in an imperfect manner, by viewing\r\na narrow slit between two nearly closed window-shutters, through a very\r\nexcellent glass prism held close to the eye, with the refracting angle\r\nparallel to the line of light. When the spectrum is formed by the sun’s\r\nrays, either direct or indirect, as from the sky, clouds, rainbow,\r\nmoon, or planets, the black bands are always found to be in the same\r\nparts of the spectrum, and under all circumstances to maintain the same\r\nrelative position, breadth and intensities.’\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated in reference to the solar spectrum it will\r\nevidently appear, that white light is nothing else than a compound of\r\nall the prismatic colours; and this may be still farther illustrated\r\nby shewing, that the seven primary colours, when again put together,\r\nrecompose white light. This may be rudely proved for the purpose of\r\nillustration, by mixing together seven different powders, having the\r\ncolours and proportion of the spectrum; but the best mode, on the\r\nwhole, is the following. Let two circles be drawn on a smooth round\r\nboard, covered with white paper, as in fig. 34: Let the outermost be\r\ndivided into 360 equal parts; then draw seven right lines as A,B,C,\r\n&c., from the center to the outermost circle, making the lines A and\r\nB include 80 degrees of that circle. The lines B and C, 40 degrees; C\r\nand D, 60; D and E, 60; E and F, 48; F and G, 27; G and A, 45. Then\r\nbetween these two circles paint the space AG red, inclining to orange\r\nnear G; GF orange, inclining to yellow near F; FE yellow, inclining to\r\ngreen near E; ED green, inclining to blue near D; DC blue, inclining to\r\nindigo near C; CB indigo, inclining to violet near B; and BA violet,\r\ninclining to a soft red near A. This done, paint all that part of\r\nthe board black which lies within the inner circle; and putting an\r\naxis through the centre of the board, let it be turned swiftly round\r\nthat axis, so that the rays proceeding from the above colours, may be\r\nall blended and mixed together in coming to the eye. Then the whole\r\ncoloured part will appear like a white ring a little grayish--not\r\nperfectly white, because no art can prepare or lay on perfect colours,\r\nin all their delicate shades, as found in the real spectrum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 34._]\r\n\r\nThat all the colours of light, when blended together in their proper\r\nproportions, produce a pure _white_ is rendered certain by the\r\nfollowing experiment. Take a large convex glass, and place it in the\r\nroom of the paper or screen on which the solar spectrum was depicted\r\n(LM fig. 31), the glass will unite all the rays which come from the\r\nprism, if a paper is placed to receive them, and you will see a\r\ncircular spot of a pure lively white. The rays will cross each other in\r\nthe focus of the glass, and, if the paper be removed a little further\r\nfrom that point, you will see the prismatic colours again displayed,\r\nbut in an inverted order, owing to the crossing of the rays.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 2.--ON THE COLOURS OF NATURAL OBJECTS.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated above we may learn the true cause of those\r\ndiversified hues exhibited by natural and artificial objects, and the\r\nvariegated colouring which appears on the face of nature. It is owing\r\nto the surfaces of bodies being disposed to reflect one colour rather\r\nthan another. When this disposition is such that the body reflects\r\nevery kind of ray, in the mixed state in which it receives them, that\r\nbody appears _white_ to us--which, properly speaking, is no colour,\r\nbut rather the assemblage of all colours. If the body has a fitness\r\nto reflect one sort of rays more abundantly than others, by absorbing\r\nall the others, it will appear of the colour belonging to that species\r\nof rays. Thus, the grass is _green_, because it absorbs all the rays\r\nexcept the green. It is these green rays only which the grass, the\r\ntrees, the shrubs, and all the other verdant parts of the landscape\r\nreflect to our sight, and which make them appear green. In the same\r\nmanner the different flowers reflect their respective colours; the\r\nrose, the red rays; the violet, the blue; the jonquil, the yellow; the\r\nmarigold, the orange, and every object, whether natural or artificial,\r\nappears of that colour which its peculiar texture is fitted to reflect.\r\nA great number of bodies are fitted to reflect at once several kinds\r\nof rays, and of consequence they appear under mixed colours. It may\r\neven happen, that of two bodies which should be green, for example,\r\none may reflect the pure green of light, and the other the mixture of\r\nyellow and blue. This quality, which varies to infinity, occasions the\r\ndifferent kinds of rays to unite in every possible manner, and every\r\npossible proportion; and hence the inexhaustible variety of shades\r\nand hues which nature has diffused over the landscape of the world.\r\nWhen a body absorbs nearly all the light which reaches it, that body\r\nappears _black_. It transmits to the eye so few reflected rays that\r\nit is scarcely perceptible in itself, and its presence and form make\r\nno impression upon us, unless as it interrupts the brightness of the\r\nsurrounding space. Black is, therefore, the absence of all the coloured\r\nrays.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, then, that all the various assemblages of colours which\r\nwe see in the objects around us, _are not in the bodies themselves_,\r\nbut in the light which falls upon them. There is no colour _inherent_\r\nin the grass, the trees, the fruits, and the flowers, nor even in the\r\nmost splendid and variegated dress that adorns a lady. All such objects\r\nare as destitute of colour, in themselves, as bodies which are placed\r\nin the centre of the earth, or as the chaotic materials out of which\r\nour globe was formed, before light was created. For where there is no\r\nlight, there is no colour. Every object is black, or without colour,\r\nin the dark, and it only appears coloured as soon as light renders it\r\nvisible. This is further evident from the following experiment. If we\r\nplace a coloured body in one of the colours of the spectrum which is\r\nformed by the prism, it appears of the colour of the rays in which it\r\nis placed. Take, for example, a red rose, and expose it first to the\r\nred rays, and it will appear of a more brilliant ruddy hue. Hold it\r\nin the blue rays, and it appears no longer red, but of a dingy blue\r\ncolour, and in like manner its colour will appear different, when\r\nplaced in all the other differently coloured rays. This is the reason\r\nwhy the colours of objects are essentially altered by the nature of\r\nthe light in which they are seen. The colours of ribbons and various\r\npieces of silk or woollen stuff are not the same when viewed by\r\ncandle-light as in the day time. In the light of a candle or a lamp,\r\nblue often appears green, and yellow objects assume a whitish aspect.\r\nThe reason is that the light of a candle is not so pure a white as that\r\nof the sun, but has a yellowish tinge, and therefore, when refracted\r\nby the prism, the yellowish rays are found to predominate, and the\r\nsuperabundance of yellow rays gives to blue objects a greenish hue.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine we are now illustrating is one which a great many persons,\r\nespecially among the fair sex, find it difficult to admit. They cannot\r\nconceive it possible that there is no colour really inherent in their\r\nsplendid attire, and no tints of beauty in their countenances. ‘What,’\r\nsaid a certain lady, ‘are there no colours in my shawl, and in the\r\nribbons that adorn my head-dress--and, are we all as black as negroes\r\nin the dark; I should almost shudder to think of it.’ Such persons,\r\nhowever, need be in no alarm at the idea; but may console themselves\r\nwith the reflection, that, when they are stripped of all their coloured\r\nornaments in the dark, they are certain that _they will never be seen\r\nby any one_ in that state; and therefore, there is no reason to regret\r\nthe temporary loss of those beauties which light creates--when they\r\nthemselves and all surrounding objects are _invisible_. But, to give\r\na still more palpable proof of this position, the following popular\r\nexperiments may be stated.\r\n\r\nTake a pint of common spirit, and pour it into a soup dish, and then\r\nset it on fire; as it begins to blaze, throw a handful of salt into the\r\nburning spirit, and keep stirring it with a spoon. Several handfuls\r\nmay thus be successively thrown in, and then the spectators, standing\r\naround the flame, will see each other frightfully changed, their\r\ncolours being altered into a ghastly blackness, in consequence of the\r\nnature of the light which falls upon them--which produces colours very\r\ndifferent from those of the solar light. The following experiment,\r\nas described by Sir D. Brewster, illustrates the same principle.\r\n‘Having obtained the means of illuminating any apartment with _yellow_\r\nlight, let the exhibition be made in a room with furniture of various\r\nbright colours, and with oil or water coloured paintings on the wall.\r\nThe party which is to witness the experiment should be dressed in a\r\ndiversity of the gayest colours; and the brightest coloured flowers,\r\nand highly coloured drawings should be placed on the tables. The room\r\nbeing at first lighted with ordinary lights, the bright and gay colours\r\nof every thing that it contains will be finely displayed. If the white\r\nlights are now suddenly extinguished, and the yellow lamps lighted,\r\nthe most appalling metamorphosis will be exhibited. The astonished\r\nindividuals will no longer be able to recognise each other. All the\r\nfurniture of the room, and all the objects it contains, will exhibit\r\nonly _one_ colour. The flowers will lose their hues; the paintings\r\nand drawings will appear as if they were executed in China ink, and\r\nthe gayest dresses, the brightest scarlets, the purest lilacs, the\r\nrichest blues and the most vivid greens, will all be converted into one\r\nmonotonous yellow. The complexions of the parties, too, will suffer a\r\ncorresponding change. One pallid deathlike yellow, will envelope the\r\nyoung and the old, and the _sallow_ face will alone escape from the\r\nmetamorphosis. Each individual derives merriment from the cadaverous\r\nappearance of his neighbour, without being sensible that he is one of\r\nthe ghastly assemblage.’\r\n\r\n          ----Like the unnatural hue\r\n    Which autumn paints upon the perished leaf,\r\n\r\nFrom such experiments as these we might conclude, that were the solar\r\nrays of a very different description from what they are now found to\r\nbe, the colours which embellish the face of nature, and the whole scene\r\nof our sublunary creation would assume a new aspect, and appear very\r\ndifferent from what we now behold around us in every landscape. We find\r\nthat the stars display great diversity of colour; which is doubtless\r\nowing to the different kinds of light which are emitted from those\r\nbodies; and hence we may conclude, that the colouring thrown upon the\r\nvarious objects of the universe is different in every different system,\r\nand that thus, along with other arrangements, an infinite variety of\r\ncolouring and of scenery is distributed throughout the immensity of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\nThe _atmosphere_, in consequence of its different refractive and\r\nreflective powers, is the source of a variety of colours which\r\nfrequently embellish and diversify the aspect of our sky. The\r\nair _reflects_ the blue rays most plentifully, and must therefore\r\n_transmit_ the red, orange, and yellow, more copiously than the other\r\nrays. When the sun and other heavenly bodies are at a high elevation,\r\ntheir light is transmitted without any perceptible change, but when\r\nthey are near the horizon, their light must pass through a long and\r\ndense track of air, and must therefore be considerably modified before\r\nit reach the eye of the observer. The momentum of the red rays being\r\ngreater than that of the violet, will force their way through the\r\nresisting medium, while the violet rays will be either reflected or\r\nabsorbed. If the light of the setting sun, by thus passing through\r\na long track of air, be divested of the green, blue, indigo, and\r\nviolet rays, the remaining rays which are transmitted through the\r\natmosphere, will illuminate the western clouds, first with an orange\r\ncolour; and then, as the sun gradually sinks into the horizon, the\r\ntrack through which the rays must pass becoming longer, the yellow\r\nand orange are reflected, and the clouds grow more deeply _red_, till\r\nat length the disappearance of the sun leaves them of a leaden hue by\r\nthe reflection of the blue light through the air. Similar changes of\r\ncolour are sometimes seen on the eastern and western fronts of white\r\nbuildings. St. Paul’s Church, in London, is frequently seen at sun-set,\r\ntinged with a very considerable degree of redness; and the same cause\r\noccasions the moon to assume a ruddy colour, by the light transmitted\r\nthrough the atmosphere. From such atmospherical refractions and\r\nreflections are produced those rich and beautiful hues with which our\r\nsky is gilded by the setting sun, and the glowing red which tinges the\r\nmorning and evening clouds, till their ruddy glare is tempered by the\r\npurple of twilight, and the reflected azure of the sky.\r\n\r\nWhen a direct spectrum is thrown on colours darker than itself, it\r\nmixes with them: as the yellow spectrum of the setting sun, thrown on\r\nthe green grass, becomes a greener yellow. But when a direct spectrum\r\nis thrown on colours brighter than itself, it becomes instantly changed\r\ninto the reverse spectrum, which mixes with those brighter colours.\r\nThus the yellow spectrum of the setting sun thrown on the luminous\r\nsky, becomes blue, and changes with the colour or brightness of the\r\nclouds on which it appears. The red part of light being capable of\r\nstruggling through thick and resisting mediums which intercept all\r\nother colours--is likewise the cause why the sun appears red when seen\r\nthrough a fog,--why distant light, though transmitted through blue\r\nor green glass, appears red--why lamps at a distance, seen through\r\nthe smoke of a long street, are red, while those that are near, are\r\nwhite. To the same cause it is owing that a diver at the bottom of the\r\nsea is surrounded with the red light which has pierced through the\r\nsuperincumbent fluid, and that the blue rays are reflected from the\r\n_surface_ of the ocean. Hence, Dr. Halley informs us that, when he was\r\nin a diving bell, at the bottom of the sea, his hand always appeared\r\nred in the water.\r\n\r\nThe _blue_ rays, as already noticed, being unable to resist the\r\nobstructions they meet with in their course through the atmosphere, are\r\neither reflected or absorbed in their passage. It is to this cause,\r\nthat most philosophers ascribe _the blue colour of the sky_, the\r\nfaintness and obscurity of distant objects, and the bright azure which\r\ntinges the mountains of a distant landscape.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 3.--PHENOMENA OF THE RAINBOW.\r\n\r\nSince the rays of light are found to be decomposed by refracting\r\nsurfaces, and reflected in an infinite variety of modes and shades\r\nof colour, we need not be surprised at the changes produced in any\r\nscene or object by the intervention of another, and by the numerous\r\nmodifications of which the primary colours of nature are susceptible.\r\nThe vivid colours which gild the rising and the setting sun, must\r\nnecessarily differ from those which adorn its noon-day splendour.\r\nVariety of atmospheric scenery will thus necessarily be produced,\r\ngreater than the most lively fancy can well imagine. The clouds will\r\nsometimes assume the most fantastic forms, and at other times will be\r\nirradiated with beams of light, or, covered with the darkest hues, will\r\nassume a lowering aspect, prognostive of the thunder’s roar and the\r\nlightning’s flash--all in accordance with the different rays that are\r\nreflected to our eyes, or the quantity absorbed by the vapours which\r\nfloat in the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nLight, which embellishes with so much magnificence a pure and serene\r\nsky, by means of innumerable bright starry orbs which are spread over\r\nit, sometimes, in a dark and cloudy sky, exhibits an ornament which,\r\nby its pomp, splendour and variety of colours, attracts the attention\r\nof every eye that has an opportunity of beholding it. At certain\r\ntimes, when there is a shower either around us, or at a distance from\r\nus in an opposite quarter to that of the sun, a species of arch or\r\nbow is seen in the sky, adorned with all the seven primary colours of\r\nlight. This phenomenon, which is one of the most beautiful meteors in\r\nnature, has obtained the name of the RAINBOW. The rainbow was,\r\nfor ages, considered as an inexplicable mystery, and by some nations\r\nit was adored as a deity. Even after the dawn of true philosophy,\r\nit was a considerable time before any discovery of importance was\r\nmade, as to the true causes which operate in the production of this\r\nphenomenon. About the year 1571, M. Fletcher of Breslau, made a certain\r\napproximation to the discovery of the true cause, by endeavouring to\r\naccount for the colours of the rainbow by means of a double refraction\r\nand one reflection. A nearer approximation was made by Antonio de\r\nDominis, bishop of Spalatro, about 1601. He maintained that the\r\ndouble refraction of Fletcher, _with an intervening reflection_,\r\nwas sufficient to produce the colours of the bow, and also to bring\r\nthe rays that formed them to the eye of the spectator, without any\r\nsubsequent reflection. To verify this hypothesis, he procured a small\r\nglobe of solid glass, and viewing it when it was exposed to the rays\r\nof the sun--with his back to that luminary--in the same manner as he\r\nhad supposed the drops of rain were situated with respect to them, he\r\nobserved the same colours which he had seen in the rainbow, and in\r\nthe same order. But he could give no good reason _why_ the bow should\r\nbe coloured, and much less any satisfactory account of the _order_ in\r\nwhich the colours appear. It was not till Sir I. Newton discovered\r\nthe different refrangibility of the rays of light, that a complete\r\nand satisfactory explanation could be given of all the circumstances\r\nconnected with this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAs the full elucidation of this subject involves a variety of optical\r\nand mathematical investigations, I shall do little more than explain\r\nthe general principle on which the prominent phenomena of the rainbow\r\nmay be accounted for, and some of the facts and results which theory\r\nand observation have deduced.\r\n\r\nWe have just now alluded to an experiment with a glass globe:--If,\r\nthen, we take either a solid glass globe, or a hollow globe filled with\r\nwater, and suspend it so high in the solar rays above the eye, that\r\nthe spectator, with his back to the sun, can see the globe _red_;--if\r\nit be lowered slowly, he will see it orange, then yellow, then green,\r\nthen blue, then indigo, and then violet; so that the drop at different\r\nheights, shall present to the eye the seven primitive colours in\r\nsuccession. In this case, the globe, from its form, will act in some\r\nmeasure like a prism, and the ray will be separated into its component\r\nparts. The following figure will more particularly illustrate this\r\npoint. Suppose A (fig. 35.) to represent a drop of rain--which may be\r\nconsidered as a globe of glass in miniature, and will produce the same\r\neffect on the rays of light--and let SD represent a ray from\r\nthe sun falling upon the upper part of the drop at D. At the\r\npoint of entering the drop, it will suffer a refraction, and instead\r\nof going forward to C, it will be bent to N. From\r\nN a part of the light will be reflected to Q--some\r\npart of it will, of course, pass through the drop. By the obliquity\r\nwith which it falls on the side of the drop at Q, that part\r\nbecomes a kind of prism, and separates the ray into its primitive\r\ncolours. It is found by computation that, after a ray has suffered\r\ntwo refractions and one reflection, as here represented, the least\r\nrefrangible part of it, namely the _red_ ray, will make an angle with\r\nthe incident solar ray of 42° 2´, as SFQ; and the violet, or\r\ngreatest refrangible ray will make with the solar ray, an angle of 40°\r\n17´, as SCQ; and thus all the particles of water within the\r\ndifference of those two angles, namely 1° 45´--(supposing the ray to\r\nproceed merely from the centre of the sun)--will exhibit severally the\r\ncolours of the prism, and constitute the _interior_ bow of the cloud.\r\nThis holds good at whatever height the sun may chance to be in a shower\r\nof rain. If he be at a high altitude, the rainbow will be low; if he be\r\nat a low elevation, the rainbow must be high; and if a shower happen\r\nin a vale, when the spectator is on a mountain, he will sometimes see\r\nthe bow in the form of a _complete circle_ below him. We have at\r\npresent described the phenomena only of a single drop; but it is to be\r\nconsidered that in a shower of rain there are drops at all heights and\r\nat all distances; and therefore the eye situated at G will see all the\r\ndifferent colours. All those drops that are in a certain position with\r\nrespect to the spectator will reflect the red rays, all those in the\r\nnext station the orange, those in the next the green, and so on with\r\nregard to all the other colours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 35._]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the first or primary bow is formed by two\r\nrefractions and one reflection; but there is frequently a second bow,\r\non the outside of the other, which is considerably fainter. This is\r\nproduced by drops of rain above the drop we have supposed at A. If B\r\n(fig. 35.) represent one of these drops, the ray to be sent to the eye\r\nenters the drop near the bottom, and suffers _two refractions_ and _two\r\nreflections_, by which means the colours become reversed, that is, the\r\nviolet is lowest in the _exterior_ bow, and the red is lowest in the\r\n_interior_ one, and the other colours are reversed accordingly. The ray\r\nT is refracted at R: a part of it is reflected from S\r\nto T, and at T it suffers another reflection from\r\nT to U. At the points S and T part\r\nof the ray _passes through_ the drop on account of its transparency,\r\ntowards W and X, and therefore we say that _part_\r\nonly of the ray is reflected. By these losses and reflections the\r\nexterior bow becomes faint and ill-defined in comparison of the\r\ninterior or primary bow. In this case the upper part of the secondary\r\nbow will not be seen when the sun is above 54° 10´ above the horizon;\r\nand the lower part of the bow will not be seen when the sun is 60° 58´\r\nabove the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 36._]\r\n\r\nFor the further illustrations of this subject, we may introduce the\r\nfollowing section of a bow, (fig. 36.) and, in order to prevent\r\nconfusion in attempting to represent all the different colours--let\r\nus suppose only three drops of rain, and three different colours, as\r\nshown in the figure. The spectator O being in the centre of the two\r\nbows, here represented,--the planes of which must be considered as\r\nperpendicular to his view--the drops A,B, and C produce part of the\r\ninterior bow by two refractions and one reflection as stated above,\r\nand the drops D,E,F will produce the exterior bow by two refractions\r\nand two reflections, the sun’s rays being represented by 3,3. It is\r\nevident that the angle COP is less than the angle BOP, and that the\r\nangle AOP is the greatest of the three. The largest angle, then, is\r\nformed by the red rays, the middle one consists of the green, and the\r\nsmallest the purple or violet. All the drops of rain, therefore, that\r\nhappen to be in a certain position with respect to the spectator’s eye,\r\nwill reflect the red rays, and form a band or semicircle of red, and so\r\nof the other colours from drops in other positions. If the spectator\r\nalters his station, he will see a bow, but not the same as before; and\r\nif there be many spectators, they will each see a different bow, though\r\nit appears to be the same.\r\n\r\nThe rainbow assumes a _semicircular_ appearance, because it is only at\r\ncertain angles that the refracted rays are visible to our eyes, as is\r\nevident from the experiment of the glass globe formerly alluded to,\r\nwhich will refract the rays only in a certain position. We have already\r\nstated that the red rays make an angle of 42° 2´, and the violet\r\nan angle of 40° 17´. Now, if a line be drawn horizontally from the\r\nspectator’s eye, it is evident that angles formed with this line, of a\r\ncertain dimension, in every direction, will produce a circle, as will\r\nappear by attaching a cord of a given length to a certain point, round\r\nwhich it may turn as round its axis; and, in every point will describe\r\nan angle with the horizontal line of a certain and determinate extent.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happens that _three_ or more bows are visible, though\r\nwith different degrees of distinctness. I have more than once observed\r\nthis phenomenon, particularly in Edinburgh, in the month of August,\r\n1825, when three rainbows were distinctly seen in the same quarter\r\nof the sky; and, if I recollect right, a fragment of a fourth made\r\nits appearance. This happens when the rays suffer a third or fourth\r\nreflection; but, on account of the light lost by so many reflections,\r\nsuch bows are, for the most part, altogether imperceptible.\r\n\r\nIf there were no ground to intercept the rain and the view of the\r\nobserver, the rainbow would form a _complete circle_, the centre\r\nof which is diametrically opposite to the sun. Such circles are\r\nsometimes seen in the spray of the sea or of a cascade, or from the\r\ntops of lofty mountains, when the showers happen in the vales below.\r\nRainbows of various descriptions are frequently observed rising amidst\r\nthe spray and exhalations of waterfalls, and among the waves of the\r\nsea whose tops are blown by the wind into small drops. There is one\r\nregularly seen, when the sun is shining, and the spectator in a proper\r\nposition, at the fall of Staubbach, in the bosom of the Alps; one near\r\nSchaffhausen; one at the cascade of Lauffen; and one at the cataract of\r\nNiagara in North America. A still more beautiful one is said to be seen\r\nat Terni, where the whole current of the river Velino, rushing from\r\na steep precipice of nearly 200 feet high, presents to the spectator\r\nbelow, a variegated circle, over-arching the fall, and two other bows\r\nsuddenly reflected on the right and left. Don Ulloa, in the account\r\nof his journeys in South America, relates that circular rainbows are\r\nfrequently seen on the mountains above Quito in Peru. It is said that\r\na rainbow was once seen near London, caused by the exhalations of\r\nthat city, after the sun had been below the horizon more than twenty\r\nminutes.[14] A naval friend, says Mr. Bucke, informed me, that, as he\r\nwas one day watching the sun’s effect upon the exhalations near Juan\r\nFernandez, he saw upwards of five-and-twenty _ires marinæ_ animate\r\nthe sea at the same time. In these marine bows the concave sides were\r\nturned upwards, the drops of water rising from below, and not falling\r\nfrom above, as in the instances of the aerial arches. Rainbows are also\r\noccasionally seen on the grass, in the morning dew, and likewise when\r\nthe hoar-frost is descending. Dr. Langwith once saw a bow lying on the\r\nground, the colours of which were almost as lively as those of a common\r\nrainbow. It was not round but oblong, and was extended several hundred\r\nyards. The colours took up less space, and were much more lively in\r\nthose parts of the bow which were near him than in those which were\r\nat a distance. When M. Labillardiere was on Mount Teneriffe, he saw\r\nthe contours of his body traced on the clouds beneath him in all the\r\ncolours of the solar bow. He had previously witnessed this phenomenon\r\non the Kesrouan in Asia Minor. The rainbows of Greenland are said to\r\nbe frequently of a pale white, fringed with a brownish yellow, arising\r\nfrom the rays of the sun being reflected from a frozen cloud.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary view of the principal facts which have been\r\nascertained respecting the rainbow:--1. The rainbow can only be seen\r\nwhen it rains, and in that point of the heavens which is opposite to\r\nthe sun. 2. Both the primary and secondary bows are variegated with all\r\nthe prismatic colours--the red being the highest colour in the primary,\r\nor brightest bow, and the violet the highest in the exterior. 3. The\r\nprimary rainbow can never be a greater arc than a semicircle; and\r\nwhen the sun is set, no bow, in ordinary circumstances, can be seen.\r\n4. The breadth of the inner or primary bow--supposing the sun but a\r\npoint--is 1° 45´; and the breadth of the exterior bow 3° 12´, which is\r\nnearly twice as great as that of the other; and the distance between\r\nthe bows is 8° 55´. But since the body of the sun subtends an angle of\r\nabout half a degree, by so much will each bow be increased, and their\r\ndistance diminished; and therefore the breadth of the interior bow\r\nwill be 2° 15´, and that of the exterior, 3° 42´, and their distance\r\n8° 25´. The greatest semidiameter of the interior bow, on the same\r\ngrounds, will be 42° 17´, and the least of the exterior bow 50° 43´.\r\n5. When the sun is in the horizon, either in the morning or evening,\r\nthe bows will appear complete semicircles. On the other hand, when the\r\nsun’s altitude is equal to 42° 2´ or to 54° 10´, the summits of the\r\nbows will be depressed below the horizon. Hence, during the days of\r\nsummer, within a certain interval each day, no visible rainbows can be\r\nformed, on account of the sun’s high altitude above the horizon. 6.\r\nThe altitude of the bows above the horizon, or surface of the earth,\r\nvaries, according to the elevation of the sun. The altitude, at any\r\ntime, may be taken by a common quadrant, or other angular instrument;\r\nbut, if the sun’s altitude at any particular time be known, the height\r\nof the summit of any of the bows may be found, by subtracting the sun’s\r\naltitude from 42° 2´ for the inner bow, and from 54° 10´, for the\r\nouter. Thus, if the sun’s altitude were 26°, the height of the primary\r\nbow would 16° 2´, and of the secondary, 28° 10´. It follows, that the\r\nheight and the size of the bows diminish as the altitude of the sun\r\nincreases. 7. If the sun’s altitude is more than 42 degrees, and less\r\nthan 54°, the exterior bow may be seen though the interior bow is\r\ninvisible. 8. Sometimes only a portion of an arch will be visible while\r\nall the other parts of the bow are invisible. This happens when the\r\nrain does not occupy a space of sufficient extent to complete the bow;\r\nand the appearance of this position, and even of the bow itself, will\r\nbe various, according to the nature of the situation, and the space\r\noccupied by the rain.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the rainbow may be produced by artificial means, at\r\nany time when the sun is shining and not too highly elevated above the\r\nhorizon. This is effected by means of artificial fountains or _Jet\r\nd’eaus_, which are intended to throw up streams of water to a great\r\nheight. These streams, when they spread very wide, and blend together\r\nin their upper parts, form, when falling, a shower of artificial rain.\r\nIf, then, when the fountain is playing, we move between it and the sun,\r\nat a proper distance from the fountain, till our shadow point directly\r\ntowards it, and look at the shower,--we shall observe the colours of\r\nthe rainbow, strong and vivid; and, what is particularly worthy of\r\nnotice, the bow appears, notwithstanding the nearness of the shower, to\r\nbe as large, and as far off, as the rainbow which we see in a natural\r\nshower of rain. The same experiment may be made by candle-light, and\r\nwith any instrument that will form an artificial shower.\r\n\r\n_Lunar Rainbows._--A lunar bow is sometimes formed at night by the rays\r\nof the moon striking on a rain-cloud, especially when she is about\r\nthe full. But such a phenomenon is very rare. Aristotle is said to\r\nhave considered himself the first who had seen a lunar rainbow. For\r\nmore than a hundred years prior to the middle of the last century, we\r\nfind only two or three instances recorded in which such phenomena are\r\ndescribed with accuracy. In the philosophical transactions for 1783,\r\nhowever, we have an account of three having been seen in one year,\r\nand all in the same place, but they are by no means common phenomena.\r\nI have had an opportunity within the last twenty years of witnessing\r\ntwo phenomena of this description--one of which was seen at Perth, on\r\na sabbath evening, in the autumn of 1825, and the other at Edinburgh,\r\non Wednesday, the 9th of September 1840, about eight o’clock in the\r\nevening--of both which I gave a detailed description in some of the\r\npublic journals. The Moon, in both cases, was within a day or two of\r\nthe full; the arches were seen in the northern quarter of the heavens,\r\nand extended nearly from east to west, the moon being not far from the\r\nsouthern meridian. The bows appeared distinct and well defined, but no\r\ndistinct traces of the prismatic colours could be perceived on any of\r\nthem. That which appeared in 1825 was the most distinctly formed, and\r\ncontinued visible for more than an hour. The other was much fainter,\r\nand lasted little more than half an hour, dark clouds having obscured\r\nthe face of the moon. These bows bore a certain resemblance to some\r\nof the luminous arches which sometimes accompany the Aurora Borealis,\r\nand this latter phenomenon has not unfrequently been mistaken for a\r\nLunar rainbow; but they may be always distinguished by attending to the\r\nphases and position of the moon. If the moon be not visible above the\r\nhorizon, if she be in her first or last quarter, or if any observed\r\nphenomenon be not in a direction opposite to the moon, we may conclude\r\nwith certainty that, whatever appearance is presented, there is no\r\nlunar rainbow.\r\n\r\nThe rainbow is an object which has engaged universal attention, and\r\nits beautiful colours and form have excited universal admiration. The\r\npoets have embellished their writings with many beautiful allusions\r\nto this splendid meteor; and the playful school-boy, while viewing\r\nthe ‘bright enchantment,’ has frequently run ‘to catch the falling\r\nglory.’ When its arch rests on the opposite sides of a narrow valley,\r\nor on the summits of two adjacent mountains, its appearance is both\r\nbeautiful and grand. In all probability, its figure first suggested the\r\nidea of _arches_, which are now found of so much utility in forming\r\naqueducts and bridges, and for adorning the architecture of palaces and\r\ntemples. It is scarcely possible seriously to contemplate this splendid\r\nphenomenon, without feeling admiration and gratitude towards that wise\r\nand beneficent Being, whose hands have bent it into so graceful and\r\nmajestic a form, and decked it with all the pride of colours. “Look\r\nupon the rainbow,” says the son of Sirach,[15] and praise Him that\r\nmade it: very beautiful it is in the brightness thereof. It compasseth\r\nthe heaven about with a glorious circle, and the hands of the Most\r\nHigh have bended it.\" To this grand etherial bow, the inspired writers\r\nfrequently allude as one of the emblems of the majesty and splendour\r\nof the Almighty. In the prophecies of Ezekiel, the throne of Deity is\r\nrepresented as adorned with a brightness “like the appearance of the\r\nbow that is in the cloud in the day of rain--the appearance of the\r\nlikeness of the glory of Jehovah.” And, in the visions recorded in the\r\nBook of the Revelations, where the Most High is represented as sitting\r\nupon a throne; “there was a rainbow round about the throne, in sight\r\nlike unto an emerald,” as an emblem of his propitious character and of\r\nhis faithfulness and mercy. After the deluge, this bow was appointed as\r\na sign and memorial of the covenant which God made with Noah and his\r\nsons, that a flood of waters should never again be permitted to deluge\r\nthe earth and its inhabitants;--and as a pledge of inviolable fidelity\r\nand Divine benignity. When, therefore, we at any time behold “the bow\r\nin the cloud,” we have not only a beautiful and sublime phenomenon\r\npresented to the eye of sense, but also a memorial exhibited to the\r\nmental eye, assuring us, that, “While the earth remaineth, seed-time\r\nand harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and\r\nnight, _shall not cease_.”[16]\r\n\r\n                    ----On the broad sky is seen\r\n    “A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow\r\n    Conspicuous, with seven listed colours gay\r\n    Betokening peace with God and covenant new.--\r\n    He gives a promise never to destroy\r\n    The earth again by flood, nor let the sea\r\n    Surpass his bounds, nor rain to drown the world.”\r\n                          _Milton. Par. Lost, Book XI._\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 4.--REFLECTIONS ON THE BEAUTY AND UTILITY OF COLOURS.\r\n\r\nColour is one of the properties of light which constitutes, chiefly,\r\nthe beauty and sublimity of the universe. It is colour, in all its\r\ndiversified shades, which presents to our view that almost infinite\r\nvariety of aspect which appears on the scene of nature, which gives\r\ndelight to the eye and the imagination, and which adds a fresh pleasure\r\nto every new landscape we behold. Every flower which decks our fields\r\nand gardens is compounded of different hues; every plain is covered\r\nwith shrubs and trees of different degrees of verdure; and almost every\r\nmountain is clothed with herbs and grass of different shade from those\r\nwhich appear on the hills and landscape with which it is surrounded.\r\nIn the country, during summer, nature is every day, and almost every\r\nhour, varying her appearance, by the multitude and variety of her hues\r\nand decorations, so that the eye wanders with pleasure over objects\r\ncontinually diversified, and extending as far as the sight can reach.\r\nIn the flowers with which every landscape is adorned, what a lovely\r\nassemblage of colours, and what a wonderful art in the disposition of\r\ntheir shades! Here, a light pencil seems to have laid on the delicate\r\ntints; there, they are blended according to the nicest rules of art.\r\nAlthough green is the general colour which prevails over the scene\r\nof sublunary nature, yet it is diversified by a thousand different\r\nshades, so that every species of tree, shrub and herb, is clothed\r\nwith its own peculiar verdure. The dark green of the forests is thus\r\neasily distinguished from the lighter shades of cornfields and the\r\nverdure of the lawns. The system of animated nature likewise, displays\r\na diversified assemblage of beautiful colours. The plumage of birds,\r\nthe brilliant feathers of the peacock, the ruby and emerald hues which\r\nadorn the little humming-bird, and the various embellishments of many\r\nspecies of the insect tribe, present to the eye, in every region of\r\nthe globe, a scene of diversified beauty and embellishment. Nor is\r\nthe mineral kingdom destitute of such embellishments. For some of the\r\ndarkest and most unshapely stones and pebbles, when polished by the\r\nhand of art, display a mixture of the most delicate and variegated\r\ncolours. All which beauties and varieties in the scene around us are\r\nentirely owing to that property, in every ray of light, by which it is\r\ncapable of being separated into the primitive colours.\r\n\r\nTo the same cause, likewise, are to be ascribed those beautiful and\r\ndiversified appearances, which frequently adorn the face of the\r\nsky,--the yellow, orange and ruby hues which embellish the firmament\r\nat the rising of the sun, and when he is about to descend below the\r\nwestern horizon; and those aerial landscapes, so frequently beheld in\r\ntropical climes, where rivers, castles and mountains, are depicted\r\nrolling over each other along the circle of the horizon. The clouds,\r\nespecially in some countries, reflect almost every colour in nature.\r\nSometimes they wear the modest blush of the rose; sometimes they appear\r\nlike stripes of deep vermillion, and sometimes as large brilliant\r\nmasses tinged with various hues; now they are white as ivory, and now\r\nas yellow as native gold. In some tropical countries, according to St.\r\nPierre, the clouds roll themselves up into enormous masses as white as\r\nsnow, and are piled upon each other, like the Cordeliers of Peru, and\r\nare moulded into the shape of mountains, of caverns and of rocks. When\r\nthe sun sets behind this magnificent aërial net-work, a multitude of\r\nluminous rays are transmitted through each particular interstice, which\r\nproduce such an effect, that the two sides of the lozenge illuminated\r\nby them, have the appearance of being begirt with a fillet of gold;\r\nand the other two which are in the shade, seem tinged with a superb\r\nruddy orange. Four or five divergent streams of light, emanating from\r\nthe setting sun up to the zenith, clothe with fringes of gold the\r\nundeterminate summits of this celestial barrier, and proceed to strike\r\nwith the reflexes of their fires the pyramids of the collateral aerial\r\nmountains, which then appear to consist of silver and vermilion.--In\r\nshort, colour diversifies every sublunary scene, whether on the earth\r\nor in the atmosphere, it imparts a beauty to the phenomena of falling\r\nstars, of luminous arches, and the coruscations of the Aurora Borealis,\r\nand gives a splendour and sublimity to the spacious vault of heaven.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider for a moment, what would be the aspect of nature,\r\nif, instead of the beautiful variety of embellishments which now\r\nappear on every landscape, and on the concave of the sky,--_one_\r\nuniform colour had been thrown over the scenery of the universe. Let\r\nus conceive the whole of terrestrial nature to be covered with snow,\r\nso that not an object on earth should appear with any other hue, and\r\nthat the vast expanse of the firmament presented precisely the same\r\nuniform aspect. What would be the consequence? The light of the sun\r\nwould be strongly reflected from all the objects within the bounds of\r\nour horizon, and would produce a lustre which would dazzle every eye.\r\nThe day would acquire a greater _brightness_ than it now exhibits,\r\nand our eyes might, after some time, be enabled freely to expatiate\r\nover the surrounding landscape; but every thing, though enlightened,\r\nwould appear _confused_, and particular objects would scarcely be\r\ndistinguishable. A tree, a house or a church, near at hand, might\r\npossibly be distinguished, on account of its elevation above the\r\ngeneral surface of the ground, and the bed of a river by reason of its\r\nbeing depressed below it. But we should be obliged rather to guess,\r\nand to form a conjecture as to the particular object we wished to\r\ndistinguish, than to arrive at any certain conclusion respecting it;\r\nand if it lay at a considerable distance, it would be impossible, with\r\nany degree of probability, to discriminate any one object from another.\r\nNotwithstanding the universal brightness of the scene, the uniformity\r\nof colour thrown on every object, would most certainly prevent us from\r\ndistinguishing a church from a palace, a cottage from a knoll or a\r\nheap of rubbish, a splendid mansion from rugged rocks, the trees from\r\nthe hills on which they grow, or a barren desert from rich and fertile\r\nplains. In such a case, human beings would be confounded, and even\r\nfriends and neighbours be at a loss to recognize one another.\r\n\r\nThe vault of heaven, too, would wear a uniform aspect. Neither planets\r\nnor comets would be visible to any eye, nor those millions of stars\r\nwhich now shine forth with so much brilliancy, and diversify the\r\nnocturnal sky. For, it is by the contrast produced by the deep azure\r\nof the heavens and the white radiance of the stars, that those bodies\r\nare rendered visible. Were they depicted on a pure white ground, they\r\nwould not be distinguished from that ground, and would consequently be\r\ninvisible, unless any of them occasionally assumed a different colour.\r\nOf course, all that beautiful variety of aspect which now appears on\r\nthe face of sublunary nature--the rich verdure of the fields, the\r\nstately port of the forest, the rivers meandering through the valleys,\r\nthe splendid hues that diversify and adorn our gardens and meadows, the\r\ngay colouring of the morning and evening clouds, and all that variety\r\nwhich distinguishes the different seasons, would entirely disappear. As\r\nevery landscape would exhibit nearly the same aspect, there would be no\r\ninducement to the poet and the philosopher to visit distant countries\r\nto investigate the scenes of nature, and journeyings from one region\r\nto another would scarcely be productive of enjoyment. Were any other\r\nsingle colour to prevail, nearly the same results would ensue. Were a\r\ndeep ruddy hue to be uniformly spread over the scene of creation, it\r\nwould not only be offensive to the eye, but would likewise prevent all\r\ndistinction of objects. Were a dark blue or a deep violet to prevail,\r\nit would produce a similar effect, and at the same time, present the\r\nscene of nature as covered with a dismal gloom. Even if creation were\r\narrayed in a robe of _green_, which is a more pleasant colour to the\r\neye--were it not diversified with the different shades it now exhibits,\r\nevery object would be equally undistinguishable.\r\n\r\nSuch would have been the aspect of creation, and the inconveniences\r\nto which we should have been subjected, had the Creator afforded us\r\nlight without that intermixture of colours which now appears over all\r\nnature, and which serves to discriminate one object from another. Even\r\nour very apartments would have been tame and insipid, incapable of\r\nthe least degree of ornament, and the articles with which they are\r\nfurnished, almost undistinguishable, so that in discriminating one\r\nobject from another, we should have been as much indebted to the sense\r\nof touch as to the sense of vision. Our friends and fellow men would\r\nhave presented no objects of interest in our daily associations. The\r\nsparkling eye, the benignant smile, the modest blush, the blended\r\nhues of white and vermillion in the human face, and the beauty of\r\nthe female countenance, would all have vanished, and we should have\r\nappeared to one another as so many moving marble statues cast nearly\r\nin the same mould. But, what would have been worst of all, the\r\nnumerous delays, uncertainties and perplexities to which we should\r\nhave been subjected, had we been under the necessity, every moment, of\r\ndistinguishing objects by trains of reasoning, and by circumstances\r\nof time, place, and relative position? An artist, when commencing his\r\nwork in the morning, with a hundred tools of nearly the same size and\r\nshape around him, would have spent a considerable portion of his time\r\nbefore he could have selected those proper for his purpose, or the\r\nobjects to which they were to be applied; and in every department of\r\nsociety, and in all our excursions from one place to another, similar\r\ndifficulties and perplexities would have occurred. The one half of our\r\ntime must thus have been employed in uncertain guesses, and perplexing\r\nreasonings, respecting the real nature and individuality of objects,\r\nrather than in a regular train of thinking and of employment; and after\r\nall our perplexities and conjectures, we must have remained in the\r\nutmost uncertainty, as to the thousands of scenes and objects, which\r\nare now obvious to us, through the instrumentality of colours, as soon\r\nas we open our eyes.\r\n\r\nIn short, without colour, we could have had no books nor writings:\r\nwe could neither have corresponded with our friends by letters, nor\r\nhave known any thing with certainty, of the events which happened in\r\nformer ages. No written revelation of the will of God, and of his\r\ncharacter, such as we now enjoy, could have been handed down to us\r\nfrom remote periods and generations. The discoveries of science, and\r\nthe improvements of art, would have remained unrecorded. Universal\r\nignorance would have prevailed throughout the world, and the human mind\r\nhave remained in a state of demoralization and debasement. All these,\r\nand many other inconveniences and evils would have inevitably followed,\r\nhad not God painted the rays of light with a diversity of colours,\r\nAnd hence we may learn, that the most important scenes and events in\r\nthe universe, may depend upon the existence of a single principle in\r\nnature, and even upon the most minute circumstances, which we may be\r\napt to overlook, in the arrangements of the material world.\r\n\r\nIn the existing state of things in the visible creation, we cannot but\r\nadmire the Wisdom and Beneficence of the Deity, in thus enabling us\r\nto distinguish objects by so easy and expeditious a mode as _that of\r\ncolour_, which in a moment, discriminates every object and its several\r\nrelations. We rise in the morning to our respective employments,\r\nand our food, our drink, our tools, our books, and whatever is\r\nrequisite for our comfort, are at once discriminated. Without the\r\nleast hesitation or uncertainty, and without any perplexing process\r\nof reasoning, we can lay our hands on whatever articles we require.\r\nColour clothes every object with its peculiar livery, and infallibly\r\ndirects the hand in its movements, and the eye in its surveys and\r\ncontemplations. But, this is not the only end which the Divine\r\nBeing had in view, in impressing on the rays of light a diversity\r\nof colours. It is evident, that he likewise intended to minister to\r\nour _pleasures_, as well as to our wants. To every man of taste, and\r\nalmost to every human being, the combination of colours in flowers, the\r\ndelicate tints with which they are painted, the diversified shades of\r\ngreen with which the hills and dales, the mountains and the vales are\r\narrayed; and that beautiful variety which appears in a bright summer\r\nday, on all the objects of this lower creation--are sources of the\r\npurest enjoyment and delight. It is colour, too, as well as magnitude,\r\nthat adds to the _sublimity_ of objects. Were the canopy of heaven of\r\none uniform hue, it would fail in producing those lofty conceptions,\r\nand those delightful and transporting emotions, which a contemplation\r\nof its august scenery is calculated to inspire. Colours are likewise of\r\nconsiderable utility in the intercourse of general society. They serve\r\nboth for ornaments, and for distinguishing the different ranks and\r\nconditions of the community: they add to the beauty and gracefulness\r\nof our furniture and clothing. At a glance, they enable us at once to\r\ndistinguish the noble from the ignoble, the prince from his subjects,\r\nthe master from his servant, and the widow clothed with sable weeds\r\nfrom the bride adorned with her nuptial ornaments.\r\n\r\nSince colours, then, are of so much value and importance, they may\r\nbe reckoned as holding a rank among the noblest natural gifts of the\r\nCreator. As they are of such essential service to the inhabitants of\r\nour globe, there can be no doubt that they serve similar or analogous\r\npurposes throughout all the worlds in the universe. The colours\r\ndisplayed in the solar beams are common to all the globes which\r\ncompose the planetary system, and must necessarily be reflected, in\r\nall their diversified hues, from objects on their surfaces. The light\r\nwhich radiates from the fixed stars displays a similar diversity of\r\ncolours. Some of the double stars are found to emit light of different\r\nhues;--the larger star exhibiting light of a ruddy or orange hue,\r\nand the smaller one a radiance which approaches to blue or green.\r\nThere is therefore reason to conclude, that the objects connected\r\nwith the planets which revolve round such stars--being occasionally\r\nenlightened by suns of different hues--will display a more variegated\r\nand splendid scenery of colouring than is ever beheld in the world on\r\nwhich we dwell; and that one of the distinguishing characteristics of\r\ndifferent worlds, in regard to their embellishments, may consist in\r\nthe splendour and variety of colours with which the objects on their\r\nsurfaces are adorned. In the metaphorical description of the glories\r\nof the New Jerusalem, recorded in the Book of Revelation, one of the\r\nchief characteristics of that city is said to consist in the splendour\r\nand diversity of hues with which it is adorned. It is represented\r\nas “coming down from heaven, _prepared as a bride adorned for her\r\nhusband_,” and as reflecting all the beautiful and variegated colours\r\nwhich the finest gems on earth can exhibit; evidently indicating, that\r\nsplendour and variety of colouring are some of the grandest features of\r\ncelestial scenery.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the subject of colours, when seriously considered,\r\nis calculated to excite us to the adoration of the goodness and\r\nintelligence of that Almighty Being whose wisdom planned all the\r\narrangements of the universe, and to inspire us with gratitude for the\r\nnumerous conveniences and pleasures we derive from those properties and\r\nlaws he has impressed on the material system. He might have afforded\r\nus light, and even splendid illumination, without the pleasures\r\nand advantages which diversified colours now produce, and man and\r\nother animated beings might have existed in such a state. But, what\r\na very different scene would the world have presented from what it\r\nnow exhibits! Of how many thousands of pleasures should we have been\r\ndeprived! and to what numerous inconveniences and perplexities should\r\nwe have been subjected! The sublimity and glories of the firmament, and\r\nthe endless beauties and varieties which now embellish our terrestrial\r\nsystem, would have been for ever unknown, and man could have had little\r\nor no incitement to study and investigate the works of his Creator.\r\nIn this, as well as in many other arrangements in nature, we have a\r\nsensible proof of the presence and agency of that Almighty Intelligence\r\n“in whom we live, and move, and have our being.” None but an infinitely\r\nWise and Beneficent Being, intimately present in all places, could\r\nthus so regularly create in us by means of colour, those exquisite\r\nsensations which afford so much delight, and which unite us, as it\r\nwere, with every thing around us. In the diversity of hues spread\r\nover the face of creation, we have as real a display of the Divine\r\npresence as Moses enjoyed at the burning bush. The only difference\r\nis, that the one was out of the common order of Divine procedure, and\r\nthe other in accordance with those permanent laws which regulate the\r\neconomy of the universe. In every colour, then, which we contemplate,\r\nwe have a sensible memorial of the presence of that Being “whose\r\nSpirit garnished the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth,”\r\nand whose “merciful visitation” sustains us every moment in existence.\r\nBut the revelation of God to our senses, through the various objects\r\nof the material world, has become so familiar, that we are apt to\r\nforget the Author of all our enjoyments, even at the moment when we\r\nare investigating his works and participating of his benefits. “O that\r\nmen would praise Jehovah for his goodness, and for his wonderful works\r\ntowards the children of men.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nON TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE INVENTION OF TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nThe telescope is an optical instrument for viewing objects at a\r\ndistance. Its name is compounded of two Greek words,--τηλε, which\r\nsignifies, _at a distance_, or _far off_, and σχοπειν, _to view_, or to\r\n_contemplate_. By means of telescopes, remote objects are represented\r\nas if they were near, small apparent magnitudes are enlarged, confused\r\nobjects are rendered distinct, and the invisible and obscure parts of\r\nvery distant scenes are rendered perceptible and clear to the organ\r\nof vision. The telescope is justly considered as a grand and noble\r\ninstrument. It is not a little surprising that it should be in the\r\npower of man to invent and construct an instrument by which objects,\r\ntoo remote for the unassisted eye to distinguish, should be brought\r\nwithin the range of distinct vision, as if they were only a few yards\r\nfrom our eye, and that thousands of august objects in the heavens,\r\nwhich had been concealed from mortals for numerous ages, should be\r\nbrought within the limits of our contemplation, and be as distinctly\r\nperceived, as if we had been transported many millions of miles from\r\nthe space we occupy, through the celestial regions. The celebrated\r\nHuygens remarks, in reference to this instrument, that, in his opinion,\r\n‘the wit and industry of man has not produced any thing so noble and\r\nso worthy of his faculties as this sort of knowledge; (namely of the\r\ntelescope) insomuch that if any particular person had been so diligent\r\nand sagacious as to invent this instrument from the principles of\r\nnature and geometry,--for my part, I should have thought his abilities\r\nwere more than human; but the case is so far from this, that the most\r\nlearned men have not yet been able sufficiently to explain the reason\r\nof the effects of this casual invention.’\r\n\r\nThe persons who constructed the first telescopes, and the exact\r\nperiod when they were first invented, are involved in some degree of\r\nobscurity. It does not certainly appear that such instruments were\r\nknown to the ancients, although we ought not to be perfectly decisive\r\non this point. The cabinets of the curious contain some very ancient\r\ngems, of admirable workmanship, the figures on which are so small,\r\nthat they appear beautiful through a magnifying glass, but altogether\r\nconfused and indistinct to the naked eye: and, therefore, it may\r\nbe asked, if they cannot be _viewed_, how could they _be wrought_,\r\nwithout the assistance of glasses? And as some of the ancients have\r\ndeclared that the moon has a form like that of the earth, and has\r\nplains, hills, and valleys in it,--how could they know this--unless by\r\nmere conjecture, without the use of a telescope? And how could they\r\nhave known that the _Milky Way_ is formed by the combined rays of an\r\ninfinite number of stars? For Ovid states, in reference to this zone,\r\n‘its ground-work is of stars.’ But whatever knowledge the ancients may\r\nhave possessed of the telescope or other optical glasses, it is quite\r\nevident that they never had telescopes of such size and power as those\r\nwhich we now possess; and that no discoveries in the heavens, such as\r\nare now brought to light, were made by any of the ancient astronomers;\r\notherwise some allusions to them must have been found in their writings.\r\n\r\nAmong the moderns, the illustrious Friar Bacon appears to have acquired\r\nsome rude ideas respecting the construction of telescopes. ‘Lenses and\r\nspecula’ says he, ‘may be so figured that one object may be multiplied\r\ninto many, that those which are situated at a great distance may be\r\nmade to appear very near, that those which are small may be made to\r\nappear very large, and those which are obscure very plain; and we can\r\nmake stars to appear wherever we will.’ From these expressions, it\r\nappears highly probable, that this philosopher was acquainted with\r\nthe general principle both of telescopes and microscopes, and that he\r\nmay have constructed telescopes of small magnifying power, for his\r\nown observation and amusement, although they never came into general\r\nuse. He was a man of extensive learning, and made so rapid a progress\r\nin the sciences, when attending the university of Paris, that he\r\nwas esteemed the glory of that seat of learning. He prosecuted his\r\nfavourite study of experimental philosophy with unremitting ardour; and\r\nin this pursuit, in the course of twenty years, he expended no less\r\nthan £2000 in experiments, instruments, and in procuring scarce books.\r\nIn consequence of such extraordinary talents, and such astonishing\r\nprogress in the sciences, in that ignorant age, he was represented,\r\nby the envy of his illiterate fraternity, as having dealings with\r\nthe devil; and, under this pretence, he was restrained from reading\r\nlectures, and at length, in 1278, when sixty-four years of age, he was\r\nimprisoned in his cell, where he remained in confinement for ten years.\r\nHe shone like a single bright star in a dark hemisphere--the glory of\r\nour country--and died at Oxford, in the year 1294, in the eightieth\r\nyear of his age. ‘Friar Bacon,’ says the Rev. Mr. Jones, ‘may be\r\nconsidered as the first of English philosophers; his profound skill in\r\nmechanics, optics, astronomy, and chemistry, would make an honourable\r\nfigure in the present age. But he is entitled to further praise, as\r\nhe made all his studies subservient to theology, and directed all his\r\nwritings, as much as could be, to the glory of God. He had the highest\r\nregard for the sacred scriptures, and was persuaded they contain the\r\nprinciples of all true science.’\r\n\r\nThe next person who is supposed to have acquired a knowledge of\r\ntelescopes, was Joannes Baptista Porta, of Naples, who flourished\r\nin the sixteenth century. He discovered the _Camera Obscura_--the\r\nknowledge of which might naturally have led to the invention of the\r\ntelescope; but it does not appear that he ever constructed such an\r\ninstrument. Des Cartes considers James Metius, a Dutchman, as the\r\nfirst constructor of a telescope, and says, that ‘as he was amusing\r\nhimself with making mirrors and burning-glasses, he casually thought\r\nof looking through two of his lenses at a time, and found that distant\r\nobjects appeared very large and distinct.’ Others say that this great\r\ndiscovery was first made by John Lippersheim, a maker of spectacles at\r\nMiddleburg, or rather by his children, who were diverting themselves\r\nwith looking through two glasses at a time, and placing them at\r\ndifferent distances from each other. But Borellus, who wrote a book ‘on\r\nthe invention of the telescope,’ gives this honour to Zacharias Jansen,\r\nanother spectacle-maker in the same town, who, he says, made the\r\nfirst telescope in 1590. Jansen was a diligent inquirer into nature,\r\nand, being engaged in such pursuits, he was trying what use could be\r\nmade of lenses for those purposes, when he fortunately hit upon the\r\nconstruction. Having found the arrangement of glasses which produced\r\nthe effect desired, he enclosed them in a tube, and ran with his\r\ninstrument to prince Maurice, who, immediately conceiving that it might\r\nbe of use to him in his wars, desired the author to keep it a secret.\r\nSuch are the rude conceptions and selfish views of princely _warriors_,\r\nwho would apply every invention in their power for the destruction\r\nof mankind. But the telescope was soon destined to more noble and\r\nhonourable achievements. Jansen, it is said, directed his instrument\r\ntowards celestial objects, and distinctly saw the spots on the surface\r\nof the moon, and discovered many new stars, particularly seven pretty\r\nconsiderable ones in the Great Bear. His son Joannes is said to have\r\nnoted the lucid circle near the lower limb of the moon, now named\r\n_Tycho_, from whence several bright rays seem to dart in different\r\ndirections. In viewing Jupiter, he perceived two, sometimes three, and\r\nat the most four small stars, a little above or below him, and thought\r\nthat they performed revolutions around him. This was, probably, the\r\nfirst observation of the satellites of Jupiter, though the person who\r\nmade it was not aware of the importance of his discovery.[17]\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable that different persons about Middleburgh hit upon\r\nthe invention, in different modes, about the same time. Lippersheim\r\nseems to have made his first rude telescope by adjusting two glasses\r\non a board, and supporting them on brass circles.[18] Other workmen,\r\nparticularly Metius and Jansen, in emulation of each other, seem to\r\nhave made use of that discovery, and by the new form they gave it, made\r\nall the honour of it their own. One of them, considering the effects\r\nof light as injurious to distinctness, placed the glasses in a tube\r\nblackened within. The other, still more cautious, placed the same\r\nglasses within tubes capable of sliding one in another, both to vary\r\nthe prospects, by lengthening the instrument, according to the pleasure\r\nof the observer, and to render it portable and commodious. Thus, it\r\nis probable that different persons had a share in the invention, and\r\njointly contributed to its improvement. At any rate, it is undoubtedly\r\nto the Dutch that we owe the original invention. The first telescope\r\nmade by Jansen, did not exceed fifteen or sixteen inches in length, and\r\ntherefore its magnifying power could not have been very great.\r\n\r\nThe famous Galileo has frequently been supposed to have been the\r\ninventor of the telescope, but he acknowledges that he had not the\r\nhonour of being the original inventor, having first learned from\r\na German, that such an instrument had already been made; although,\r\nfrom his own account, it appears that he had actually re-invented\r\nthis instrument. The following is the account, in his own words, of\r\nthe circumstances which led him to construct a telescope. ‘Nearly\r\nten months ago (namely in April or May 1609) it was reported that a\r\ncertain Dutchman had made a perspective through which many distant\r\nobjects appeared distinct as if they were near: several effects of\r\nthis wonderful instrument were reported, which some believed and\r\nothers denied: but, having it confirmed to me a few days after by\r\na letter from the noble John Badoverie, at Paris, I applied myself\r\nto consider the reason of it, and by what means I might contrive a\r\nsimilar instrument, which I afterwards attained to by the doctrine of\r\nrefractions. And, first, I prepared a leaden tube, to whose extremities\r\nI fitted two spectacle-glasses, both of them plain on one side, and\r\non the other side, one of them was spherically convex, and the other\r\nconcave. Then applying my eye to the concave, I saw objects appear\r\npretty large and pretty near me. They appeared three times nearer and\r\nnine times larger in surface than to the naked eye: and soon after I\r\nmade another, which represented objects about sixty times larger, and\r\neight times nearer; and, at last, having spared no labour nor expense,\r\nI made an instrument so excellent, as to show things almost a thousand\r\ntimes larger, and above thirty times nearer, than to the naked eye.’\r\nIn another part of his writings, Galileo informs us that ‘he was at\r\nVenice when he heard of Prince Maurice’s instrument, but nothing of\r\nits construction; that the first night, after he returned to Padua,\r\nhe solved the problem, and made his instrument the next day; and soon\r\nafter, presented it to the Doge at Venice, who, to do him honour for\r\nhis grand invention, gave him the ducal letters which settled him for\r\nlife in his lectureship at Padua; and the Republic, on the twenty-fifth\r\nof August in the same year (1610) more than tripled his salary as\r\nprofessor.’\r\n\r\nThe following is the account which this philosopher gives of the\r\nprocess of reasoning, which led him to the construction of a\r\ntelescope:--‘I argued in the following manner. The contrivance consists\r\neither of one glass or more--one is not sufficient, since it must\r\nbe either convex, concave, or plane; the last does not produce any\r\nsensible alteration in objects, the concave diminishes them; it is true\r\nthat the convex magnifies, but it renders them confused and indistinct;\r\nconsequently one glass is insufficient to produce the desired effect.\r\nProceeding to consider two glasses, and bearing in mind that the plane\r\nglass causes no change, I determined that the instrument could not\r\nconsist of the combination of a plane glass with either of the other\r\ntwo. I therefore applied myself to make experiments on combinations of\r\nthe two other kinds; and thus obtained that of which I was in search.’\r\nIf the true inventor is the person who makes the discovery by reasoning\r\nand reflection, by tracing facts and principles to their consequences,\r\nand by applying his invention to important purposes, then, Galileo may\r\nbe considered as the real inventor of the telescope. No sooner had he\r\nconstructed this instrument--before he had seen any similar one--than\r\nhe directed his tube to the celestial regions, and his unwearied\r\ndiligence and ardour were soon rewarded by a series of new and splendid\r\ndiscoveries. He descried the four satellites of Jupiter, and marked the\r\nperiods of their revolutions; he discovered the phases of Venus, and\r\nthus was enabled to adduce a new proof of the Copernican system, and\r\nto remove an objection that had been brought against it. He traced on\r\nthe lunar orb, a resemblance to the structure of the earth, and plainly\r\nperceived the outlines of mountains and vales, casting their shadows\r\nover different parts of its surface. He observed, that when Mars was\r\nin quadrature, his figure varied slightly from a perfect circle;\r\nand that Saturn consisted of a triple body, having a small globe on\r\neach side--which deception was owing to the imperfect power of his\r\ntelescope, which was insufficient to show him that the phenomenon was\r\nin reality a ring. In viewing the sun, he discovered large dark spots\r\non the surface of that luminary, by which he ascertained that that\r\nmighty orb performed a revolution round its axis. He brought to view\r\nmultitudes of stars imperceptible to the naked eye, and ascertained\r\nthat those nebulous appearances in the heavens which constitute the\r\nMilky Way, consist of a vast collection of minute stars, too closely\r\ncompacted together to produce an impression on our unassisted vision.\r\n\r\nThe results of Galileo’s observations were given to the world in\r\na small work, entitled ‘_Nuncius Sidereus_,’ or, ‘News from the\r\nstarry regions,’ which produced an extraordinary sensation among\r\nthe learned. These discoveries soon spread throughout Europe, and\r\nwere incessantly talked of, and were the cause of much speculation\r\nand debate among the circles of philosophers. Many doubted; many\r\npositively refused to believe so novel and unlooked-for announcements,\r\nbecause they ran counter to the philosophy of Aristotle, and all the\r\npreconceived notions which then prevailed in the learned world. It\r\nis curious, and may be instructive, to consider to what a length of\r\nabsurdity, ignorance and prejudice carried many of those who made\r\npretensions to learning and science. Some tried to reason against\r\nthe facts alleged to be discovered, others contented themselves, and\r\nendeavoured to satisfy others, with the simple _assertion_ that such\r\nthings were not, and could not possibly be; and the manner in which\r\nthey supported themselves in their incredulity was truly ridiculous.\r\n‘O my dear Kepler,’ says Galileo in a letter to that astronomer,\r\n‘how I wish we could have one hearty laugh together. Here at Padua\r\nis the principal professor of philosophy, whom I have repeatedly and\r\nurgently requested to look at the moon and planets through my glass,\r\nwhich _he pertinaciously refuses to do_, lest his opinions should be\r\noverturned. Why are you not here? what shouts of laughter we should\r\nhave at this glorious folly! and to hear the professor of philosophy at\r\nPisa labouring with the Grand Duke with logical arguments, as if with\r\nmagical incantations, to charm the new planets out of the sky.’ Another\r\nopponent of Galileo, one Christmann, says in a book he published, ‘We\r\nare not to think that Jupiter has four satellites given him by nature,\r\nin order, by revolving round him, to immortalize the Medici who first\r\nhad notice of the observation. These are the _dreams of idle men_,\r\nwho love ludicrous ideas better than our laborious and industrious\r\ncorrection of the heavens. Nature abhors so horrible a chaos; and\r\nto the truly wise, such vanity is detestable.’ One Martin Horky, a\r\nwould-be philosopher, declared to Kepler, ‘I will never concede his\r\nfour new planets to that Italian from Padua, _though I should die for\r\nit_;’ and he followed up this declaration, by publishing a book against\r\nGalileo, in which he examines four principal questions respecting the\r\nalleged planets; 1. Whether they exist? 2. What they are? 3. What they\r\nare like? 4. Why they are? The first question is soon disposed of by\r\ndeclaring positively that he has examined the heavens with Galileo’s\r\nown glass, and that no such thing as a satellite about Jupiter exists.\r\nTo the second, he declares solemnly that he does not more surely\r\nknow, that he has a soul in his body than that reflected rays are\r\nthe sole cause of Galileo’s erroneous observations. In regard to the\r\nthird question, he says, that these planets are like the smallest fly\r\ncompared to an elephant; and finally, concludes on the fourth, that\r\nthe only use of them is to gratify Galileo’s ‘thirst of gold,’ and to\r\nafford himself a subject of discussion. Kepler, in a letter to Galileo,\r\nwhen alluding to Horky, says, ‘He begged so hard to be forgiven, that I\r\nhave taken him again into favour upon this preliminary condition--that\r\nI am to show him Jupiter’s satellites, AND HE IS TO SEE THEM,\r\nand own that they are there.’\r\n\r\nThe following is a specimen of the reasoning of certain pretended\r\nphilosophers of that age against the discoveries of Galileo. Sizzi, a\r\nFlorentine astronomer, reasons in this strain: ‘There are seven windows\r\ngiven to animals in the domicile of the head, through which the air\r\nis admitted to the rest of the tabernacle of the body to enlighten,\r\nto warm and to nourish it; two nostrils, two eyes, two ears, and a\r\nmouth; so in the heavens, or the great world, there are two favourable\r\nstars, two unpropitious, two luminaries, and Mercury alone undecided\r\nand indifferent. From which and many other similar phenomena in nature,\r\nsuch as the seven metals, &c., we gather that the number of planets\r\nis _necessarily seven_. Moreover, the satellites are invisible to\r\nthe naked eye, and therefore can exert no influence on the earth, and\r\ntherefore would be useless, _and therefore do not exist_. Besides, as\r\nwell the Jews as other ancient nations have adopted the division of\r\nthe week into seven days, and have named them from the seven planets.\r\nNow, if we increase the number of the planets, this whole system\r\nfalls to the ground.’ The opinions which then prevailed in regard to\r\nGalileo’s observations on the moon, were such as the following:--Some\r\nthought that the dark shades on the moon’s surface arose from the\r\ninterposition of opaque bodies floating between her and the sun, which\r\nprevent his light from reaching those parts; others imagined that, on\r\naccount of her vicinity to the earth, she was partly tainted with the\r\nimperfections of our terrestrial and elementary nature, and was not\r\nof that entirely pure and refined substance of which the more remote\r\nheavens consist: and a third party looked on her as a vast mirror, and\r\nmaintained that the dark parts of her surface were the reflected images\r\nof our earthly forests and mountains.\r\n\r\nSuch learned nonsense is a disgrace to our species, and to the\r\nrational faculties with which man is endowed, and exhibits, in a most\r\nludicrous manner, the imbecility and prejudice of those who made bold\r\npretensions to erudition and philosophy. The statement of such facts,\r\nhowever, may be instructive, if they tend to guard us against those\r\nprejudices and pre-conceived opinions, which prevent the mind from the\r\ncordial reception of truth, and from the admission of improvements in\r\nsociety which run counter to long-established customs. For the same\r\nprinciples and prejudices, though in a different form, still operate\r\nin society and retard the improvement of the social state, the march\r\nof science, and the progress of Christianity. How ridiculous is it for\r\na man, calling himself a philosopher, to be afraid to look through a\r\nglass to an existing object in the heavens, lest it should endanger\r\nhis previous opinions! And how foolish is it to resist any improvement\r\nor reformation in society, because it does not exactly accord with\r\nexisting opinions, and with ‘the wisdom of our ancestors.’\r\n\r\nIt is not a little surprising, that Galileo should have first hit on\r\nthat construction of a telescope which goes by his name, and which\r\nwas formed with a _concave_ glass next the eye. This construction of\r\na telescope is more difficult to be understood, in theory, than one\r\nwhich is composed solely of convex glasses; and its field of view is\r\ncomparatively very small, so that it is almost useless when attempted\r\nto be made of a great length. In the present day, we cannot help\r\nwondering that Galileo and other astronomers, should have made such\r\ndiscoveries as they did with such an instrument, the use of which must\r\nhave required a great degree of patience and address. Galileo’s best\r\ntelescope, which he constructed ‘with great trouble and expense,’\r\nmagnified the diameters of objects only thirty-three times; but its\r\nlength is not stated--which would depend upon the focal distance of the\r\nconcave eye-glass. If the eye-glass was two inches focus, the length\r\nof the instrument would be five feet four inches; if it was only one\r\ninch, the length would be two feet eight inches, which is the least we\r\ncan allow to it--the object-glass being thirty-three inches focus, and\r\nthe eye-glass placed an inch within this focus. With this telescope,\r\nGalileo discovered the satellites of Jupiter, the crescent of Venus,\r\nand the other celestial objects to which we have already alluded.\r\nThe telescopes made in Holland, are supposed to have been constructed\r\nsolely of _convex_ glasses, on the principle of the astronomical\r\ntelescope; and, if so, Galileo’s telescope was in reality a new\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nCertain other claimants of the invention of the telescope, have\r\nappeared, besides those already mentioned. Francis Fontana, in his\r\n‘celestial observations,’ says, that he was assured by a Mr. Hardy,\r\nadvocate of the parliament of Paris, a person of great learning and\r\nundoubted integrity, that on the death of his father, there was found\r\namong his things an old tube, by which distant objects were distinctly\r\nseen, and that it was of a date long prior to the telescope lately\r\ninvented, and had been kept by him as a secret. Mr. Leonard Digges,\r\na gentleman who lived near Bristol, in the seventeenth century, and\r\nwas possessed of great and various knowledge, positively asserts in\r\nhis ‘_Stratoticos_,’ and in another work, that his father, a military\r\ngentleman, had an instrument which he used in the field, by which he\r\ncould bring distant objects near, and could know a man at the distance\r\nof three miles. Mr. Thomas Digges, in the preface to his ‘Pantometria,’\r\npublished in 1591, declares, “My father, by his continual painful\r\npractices, assisted by demonstrations mathematical, was able, and\r\nsundry times hath by proportional glasses, duly situate in convenient\r\nangles, not only discovered things far off, read letters, numbered\r\npieces of money, with the very coin and superscription thereof, cast by\r\nsome of his friends of purpose, upon downs in open fields, but also,\r\nseven miles off, declared what hath been done that instant, in private\r\nplaces. He hath also, sundry times, by the sun-beams, fired powder\r\nand discharged ordnance half a mile and more distant, and many other\r\nmatters far more strange and rare, of which there are yet living divers\r\nwitnesses.”\r\n\r\nIt is by no means unlikely, that persons accustomed to reflection,\r\nand imbued with a certain degree of curiosity, when handling\r\nspectacle-glasses, and amusing themselves with their magnifying powers\r\nand other properties, might sometimes hit upon the construction\r\nof a telescope; as it only requires two lenses of different focal\r\ndistances to be held at a certain distance from each other, in order\r\nto show distant objects magnified. Nay, even one lens, of a long\r\nfocal distance, is sufficient to constitute a telescope of a moderate\r\nmagnifying power, as I shall show in the sequel. But such instruments,\r\nwhen they happened to be constructed accidentally, appear to have been\r\nkept as secrets, and confined to the cabinets of the curious, so that\r\nthey never came into general use; and as their magnifying power would\r\nprobably be comparatively small, the appearance of the heavenly bodies\r\nwould not be much enlarged by such instruments--nor is it likely that\r\nthey would be often directed to the heavens. On the whole, therefore,\r\nwe may conclude that the period when instruments of this description\r\ncame into general use, and were applied to useful purposes, was when\r\nGalileo constructed his first telescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE CAMERA OBSCURA.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to a particular description of the different kinds\r\nof telescopes, I shall first give a brief description of the Camera\r\nObscura, as the phenomena exhibited by this instrument tend to\r\nillustrate the principle of a refracting telescope.\r\n\r\nThe term _Camera Obscura_ literally signifies a darkened vault or roof;\r\nand hence it came to denote a chamber, or box, or any other place\r\nmade dark for the purpose of optical experiments. The camera obscura,\r\nthough a simple, is yet a very curious and noble contrivance; as it\r\nnaturally and clearly explains the manner in which vision is performed,\r\nand the principle of the telescope, and entertains the spectator with\r\na most exquisite picture of surrounding objects, painted in the most\r\naccurate proportions and colours by the hand of nature. The manner of\r\nexhibiting the pictures of objects in a dark room is as follows:--In\r\none of the window-shutters of a room which commands a good prospect\r\nof objects not very distant, a circular hole should be cut of four or\r\nfive inches diameter. In this hole an instrument should be placed,\r\ncalled a _Scioptric ball_, which has three parts, a frame, a ball, and\r\na lens. The ball has a circular hole cut through the middle, in which\r\nthe lens is fixed, and its use is, to turn every way so as to take in\r\na view of objects on every side. The chamber should be made perfectly\r\ndark; and a white screen, or a large sheet of elephant paper, should be\r\nplaced opposite to the lens, and in its focus, to receive the image.\r\nIf then, the objects without be strongly enlightened by the sun, there\r\nwill be a beautiful living picture of the scene delineated on the white\r\nscreen, where every object is beheld in its proportions, and with its\r\ncolours even more vivid than life; green objects appear in the picture\r\nmore intensely green, and yellow, blue, red or white flowers appear\r\nmuch more beautiful in the picture than in nature; if the lens be a\r\ngood one, and the room perfectly dark, the perspective is seen in\r\nperfection. The lights and shadows are not only perfectly just, but\r\nalso greatly heightened; and, what is peculiar to this delineation,\r\nand which no other picture or painting can exhibit--the _motions_ of\r\nall the objects are exactly expressed in the picture; the boughs of\r\nthe trees wave, the leaves quiver, the smoke ascends in a waving form,\r\nthe people walk, the children at their sports leap and run, the horse\r\nand cart move along, the ships sail, the clouds soar and shift their\r\naspects, and all as natural as in the real objects; the motions being\r\nsomewhat quicker, as they are performed in a more contracted scene.\r\n\r\nThese are the _inimitable_ perfections of a picture, drawn by the rays\r\nof light as the only pencil in nature’s hand, and which are finished\r\nin a moment; for no sensible interval elapses before the painting is\r\ncompleted, when the ground on which it is painted is prepared and\r\nadjusted. In comparison of such a picture, the finest productions of\r\nthe most celebrated artists, the proportions of Raphael, the natural\r\ntints and colouring of Titian, and the shadowing of the Venetians,\r\nare but coarse and sorry daubings, when set in competition with what\r\nnature can exhibit by the rays of light passing through a single lens.\r\nThe Camera obscura is at the same time the painter’s assistant, and\r\nthe painter’s reproach. From the picture it forms he receives his best\r\ninstructions, and is shown what he should endeavour to attain; and\r\nhence, too, he learns the imperfections of his art, and what it is\r\nimpossible for him to imitate. As a proof of this, the picture formed\r\nin the dark chamber will bear to be magnified to a great extent,\r\nwithout defacing its beauty, or injuring the fineness of its parts; but\r\nthe finest painted landscape, if viewed through a high magnifier will\r\nappear only as a coarse daubing.\r\n\r\nThe following scheme will illustrate what has been now stated\r\nrespecting the dark chamber. EF represents a darkened room, in the side\r\nof which, IK, is made the circular hole V, in which, on the inside,\r\nis fixed the scioptric ball. At some considerable distance from this\r\nhole is exhibited a landscape of houses, trees, and other objects,\r\nABCD, which are opposite to the window. The rays which flow from the\r\ndifferent objects which compose this landscape, to the lens at V, and\r\nwhich pass through it, are converged to their respective foci, on the\r\nopposite wall of the chamber HG or on a white moveable screen placed\r\nin the focus of the lens, where they all combine to paint a lively and\r\nbeautiful picture of the range of objects directly opposite, and on\r\neach side, so far as the lens can take in.\r\n\r\nThough I have said, that a scioptric ball and socket are expedient to\r\nbe used in the above experiment, yet where such an instrument is not\r\nat hand, the lens may be placed in a short tube made of pasteboard or\r\nany other material, and fixed in the hole made in the window shutter.\r\nThe only imperfection attending this method is, that the lens can\r\nexhibit those objects only which lie directly opposite the window.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 37._]\r\n\r\nSome may be disposed to consider it as an imperfection in this picture,\r\nthat all the objects appear in an _inverted_ position; as they must\r\nnecessarily do, according to what we formerly stated respecting the\r\nproperties of convex lenses, (p. 72). There are, however, different\r\nmodes of viewing the picture as if it were erect. For, if we stand\r\nbefore the picture, and hold a common mirror against our breast at\r\nan acute angle with the picture, and look down upon it, we shall see\r\nall the images of the objects as if restored to their erect position;\r\nand by the reflection of the mirror, the picture will receive such a\r\nlustre as will make it still more delightful. Or, if a large concave\r\nmirror were placed before the picture at such a distance, that its\r\nimage may appear before the mirror, it will then appear erect and\r\npendulous in the air in the front of the mirror. Or, if the image be\r\nreceived on a frame of paper, we may stand behind the frame, with our\r\nface towards the window, and look down upon the objects, when they will\r\nappear as if erect.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of the Camera Obscura may serve to explain and\r\nillustrate the nature of a common refracting telescope. Let us suppose,\r\nthat the lens in the window-shutter represents the object-glass of a\r\nrefracting telescope. This glass forms an image in its focus, which\r\nis in every respect an exact picture or representation of the objects\r\nbefore it; and consequently the same idea is formed in the mind, of the\r\nnature, form, magnitude, and colour of the object--whether the eye at\r\nthe centre of the glass views the object itself, or the image formed in\r\nits focus. For, as formerly stated, the object and its image are both\r\nseen under the same angles by the eye placed at the centre of the lens.\r\nWithout such an image as is formed in the camera obscura--depicted\r\neither in the tube of a telescope or in the eye itself--no telescope\r\ncould possibly be formed. If we now suppose that, behind the image\r\nformed in the dark chamber, we apply a convex lens of a short focal\r\ndistance to view that image, then the image will be seen distinctly,\r\nin the same manner as we view common objects, such as a leaf or a\r\nflower, with a magnifying glass; consequently, the object itself will\r\nbe seen distinct and magnified. And, as the same image is nearer to one\r\nlens than the other, it will subtend a larger angle at the nearest\r\nlens, and of course, will appear larger than through the other, and\r\nconsequently the object will be seen magnified in proportion. For\r\nexample, let us suppose the lens in the camera obscura, or the object\r\nlens of a telescope, to be five feet, or sixty inches focal distance,\r\nat this distance from the glass, an image of the distant objects\r\nopposite to it will be formed. If now, we place a small lens two inches\r\nfocal distance beyond this point, or five feet two inches from the\r\nobject-glass, the objects, when viewed through the small lens, will\r\nappear considerably magnified, and apparently much nearer than to the\r\nnaked eye. The degree of magnifying power is in proportion to the\r\nfocal distances of the two glasses; that is, in the present case, in\r\nthe proportion of two inches, the focus of the small lens, to sixty\r\ninches, the focus of the object lens. Divide sixty by two, the quotient\r\nis thirty, which gives the magnifying power of such a telescope, that\r\nis, it represents objects thirty times nearer, or under an angle thirty\r\ntimes larger than to the naked eye. If the eye-glass, instead of being\r\ntwo inches, were only one and a half inch focus, the magnifying power\r\nwould be in the proportion of one and a half to sixty, or forty times.\r\nIf the eye-glass were three inches focus, the magnifying power would\r\nbe twenty times; and so on, with regard to other proportions. In all\r\ncases, where a telescope is composed of only two convex lenses, the\r\nmagnifying power is determined, _by dividing the focal distance of the\r\nobject-glass, by the focal distance of the eye-glass_, and the quotient\r\nexpresses the number of times the object is magnified, in length\r\nand breadth. This and various other particulars, will be more fully\r\nillustrated in the sequel.\r\n\r\nIn performing experiments with the camera obscura in a darkened\r\nchamber, it is requisite that the following particulars be attended\r\nto:--1. That the lens be well figured, and free from any veins or\r\nblemishes that might distort the picture. 2. That it be placed\r\n_directly against_ the object whose image we wish to see distinctly\r\ndelineated. 3. The lens should be of a proper size both as to its\r\nbreadth and focal distance. It should not be less than three or four\r\nfeet focal distance, otherwise the picture will be too small, and the\r\nparts of objects too minute to be distinctly perceived; nor should\r\nit exceed fifteen or eighteen feet, as in this case the picture will\r\nbe faint, and of course not so pleasing. The best medium as to focal\r\ndistance, is from five to eight or ten feet. The aperture, too, or\r\nbreadth of the glass, should not be too small, otherwise the image\r\nwill be obscure, and the minute parts of it invisible for want of a\r\nsufficient quantity of light. A lens of six feet focal distance, for\r\nexample, will require an aperture of at least two inches. Lenses of a\r\nshorter focal distance require less apertures, and those of a longer\r\nfocal distance larger. But if the aperture be too large, the image\r\nwill be confused, and indistinct, by the admission of too much light.\r\n4. We should never attempt to exhibit the images of objects, unless\r\nwhen the sun is shining and strongly illuminating the objects, except\r\nin the case of very near objects placed in a good light. As one of the\r\ngreatest beauties, in the phenomena of the dark chamber, consists in\r\nthe exquisite appearance and contrast of light and shadows, nothing of\r\nthis kind can be perceived but from objects directly illuminated by the\r\nsun. 5. A south window should never be used in the forenoon, as the sun\r\ncannot then enlighten the north side of an object; and besides, his\r\nrays would be apt to shine upon the lens, which would make the picture\r\nappear with a confused lustre. An east window is best in the afternoon,\r\nand a western in the morning; but a north window is in most cases to\r\nbe preferred, especially in the forenoon, when the sun is shining with\r\nhis greatest strength and splendour. In general, that window ought to\r\nbe used which looks to the quarter opposite to that in which the sun is\r\nshining.\r\n\r\nThe picture should be received upon a very white surface, as the finest\r\nand whitest paper, or a painted cloth, bordered with black; as white\r\nbodies reflect most copiously the incident rays, while black surfaces\r\nabsorb them. If the screen could be bent into the concave segment of\r\na sphere, of which the focal distance of the double convex lens which\r\nis used, is the radius, the parts of the picture adjacent to the\r\nextremities would appear most distinct. Sir D. Brewster informs us\r\nthat, having tried a number of white substances of different degrees\r\nof smoothness, and several metallic surfaces, on which to receive the\r\nimage, he happened to receive the picture on the silvered back of a\r\nlooking-glass, and was surprised at the brilliancy and distinctness\r\nwith which external objects were represented. To remove the spherical\r\nprotuberances of the tin foil, he ground the surface very carefully\r\nwith a bed of hones which he had used for working the plane specula of\r\nNewtonian telescopes. By this operation, which may be performed without\r\ninjuring the other side of the mirror, he obtained a surface finely\r\nadapted for the reception of images. The minute parts of the landscape\r\nwere formed with so much precision, and the brilliancy of colouring\r\nwas so uncommonly fine, as to equal, if not exceed the images that are\r\nformed in the air by means of concave specula.\r\n\r\nThe following additional circumstances may be stated respecting the\r\nphenomena exhibited in the dark chamber. A more critical idea may\r\nbe formed of any _movement_ in the picture here presented than from\r\nobserving the motion of the object itself. For instance, a man walking\r\nin a picture appears to have an undulating motion, or to rise up and\r\ndown every step he takes, and the hands seem to move almost exactly\r\nlike a pendulum; whereas scarcely any thing of this kind is observed\r\nin the man himself, as viewed by the naked eye. Again, if an object be\r\nplaced just twice the focal distance from the lens without the room,\r\nthe image will be formed at the same distance from the lens within the\r\nroom, and consequently will be equal in magnitude to the object itself.\r\nThe recognition of this principle may be of use to those concerned in\r\ndrawing, and who may wish, at any time, to form a picture of the exact\r\nsize of the object. If the object be placed further from the lens than\r\ntwice its focal length, the image will be less than the object. If it\r\nbe placed nearer, the image will be greater than the life. In regard to\r\nimmoveable objects, such as houses, gardens, trees, &c., we may form\r\nthe images of so many different sizes, by means of different lenses,\r\nthe shorter focus making the lesser picture, and the longer focal\r\ndistance the largest.\r\n\r\nThe experiments with the camera obscura, may likewise serve to\r\nillustrate the nature of vision, and the functions of the human eye.\r\nThe frame or socket of the scioptric ball may represent the _orbit_\r\nof the natural eye. The ball, which turns every way, resembles the\r\n_globe_ of the eye, moveable in its orbit. The hole in the ball may\r\nrepresent the _pupil_ of the eye; the convex lens corresponds to the\r\n_crystalline humour_, which is shaped like a lens, and contributes\r\nto form the images of objects on the inner part of the eye. The dark\r\nchamber itself, is somewhat similar to the _internal part of the eye_,\r\nwhich is lined all around, and under the retina, with a membrane,\r\nover which is spread a mucous of a very black colour. The white wall\r\nor frame of white paper to receive the picture of objects, is a fair\r\nrepresentation of the _retina_ of the eye, on which all the images of\r\nexternal objects are depicted. Such are some of the general points of\r\nresemblance between the apparatus connected with the dark chamber, and\r\nthe organ of vision; but the human eye is an organ of such exquisite\r\nconstruction, and composed of such a number and variety of delicate\r\nparts, that it cannot be adequately represented by any artificial\r\ncontrivance.\r\n\r\nThe darkened chamber is frequently exhibited in a manner somewhat\r\ndifferent from what we have above described, as in the following\r\nscheme, (fig. 38) which is termed the _revolving camera obscura_. In\r\nthis construction, KH represents a plane mirror or metallic reflector,\r\nplaced at half a right angle to the convex lens HI, by which, rays\r\nproceeding from objects situated in the direction O are reflected to\r\nthe lens, which forms an image of the objects on a round white table\r\nat T, around which several spectators may stand, and view the picture,\r\nas delineated on a horizontal plane. The reflector, along with its\r\ncase, is capable of being turned round, by means of a simple apparatus\r\nconnected with it, so as to take in, in succession, all the objects\r\nwhich compose the surrounding scene. But as the image here is received\r\non a flat surface, the rays _fm_, _en_, will have to diverge farther\r\nthan the central rays _dc_; and hence the representation of the\r\nobject, near the sides, will be somewhat distorted; to remedy which,\r\nthe image should be received on a concave surface, as _ab_ or PS. This\r\nis the general plan of those Camera Obscuras, fitted up in large wooden\r\ntents, which are frequently exhibited in our large cities, and removed\r\noccasionally from one town to another. Were an instrument of this\r\nkind fitted up on a _small scale_, a hole might be made in one of the\r\nsides, as at E, where the eye could be applied to view the picture. The\r\nfocal distances of the lenses used in large instruments of this kind,\r\nare generally from eight to twelve feet, in which case they produce\r\na telescopic effect upon distant objects, so as to make them appear\r\nnearer than when viewed with the naked eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 38._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 39._]\r\n\r\nThe camera obscura is frequently constructed in a _portable form_,\r\nso as to be carried about for the purpose of delineating landscapes.\r\nThe following is a brief description of the instrument in this form.\r\nAC is a convex lens placed near the end of a tube or drawer, which is\r\nmoveable in the side of a square box, within which is a plane mirror\r\nDE, reclining backward in an angle of forty-five degrees from the\r\nperpendicular _pn_. The pencils of rays flowing from the object OB,\r\nand passing through the convex lens--instead of proceeding forward and\r\nforming the image HI, are reflected upward by the mirror, and meet in\r\npoints as FG, at the same distance at which they would have met at H\r\nand I, if they had not been intercepted by the mirror. At FG, the image\r\nof the object OB is received either on a piece of oiled paper, or more\r\nfrequently on a plane _unpolished_ glass, placed in the horizontal\r\nsituation FG, which receives the images of all objects, opposite to the\r\nlens, and on which, or on an oiled paper placed upon it, their outlines\r\nmay be traced by a pencil. The moveable tube on which the lens is\r\nfixed, serves to adjust the focus for near and distant objects, till\r\ntheir images appear distinctly painted on the horizontal glass at FG.\r\nAbove is shown the most common form of the box of this kind of Camera\r\nObscura. A is the position of the lens, BC, the position of the mirror,\r\nD, the plane unpolished glass on which the images are depicted, GH a\r\nmoveable top or screen to prevent the light from injuring the picture,\r\nand EF, the moveable tube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 40._]\r\n\r\n_The Daguerreotype._--An important, and somewhat surprising discovery\r\nhas lately been made, in relation to the picture formed by the Camera\r\nObscura. It is found, that the images formed by this instrument are\r\ncapable of being indelibly fixed on certain surfaces previously\r\nprepared for the purpose, so that the picture is rendered permanent.\r\nWhen a Camera is presented to any object or landscape strongly\r\nilluminated by the sun, and the prepared ground for receiving the\r\nimage is adjusted, and a certain time allowed to elapse till the\r\nrays of light produce their due effect, in a few minutes or even\r\nseconds, a picture of the objects opposite to the lens is indelibly\r\nimpressed upon the prepared plate, in all the accurate proportions\r\nand perspective, which distinguish the images formed in a dark\r\nchamber--which representations may be hung up in apartments, along\r\nwith other paintings and engravings; and will likely retain their\r\nbeauty and lustre for many years. These are pictures of nature’s own\r\nworkmanship finished in an extremely short space of time, and with the\r\nmost exquisite delicacy and accuracy. The effect is evidently owing to\r\ncertain chemical properties in the rays of light; and opens a new field\r\nfor experiment and investigation to the philosopher. The only defect\r\nin the picture is, that it is not coloured; but, in the progress of\r\nexperiments on this subject, it is not unlikely that even this object\r\nmay be accomplished, in which case, we should be able to obtain the\r\nmost accurate landscapes and representations of all objects, which\r\ncan possibly be formed. This art or discovery goes by the name of the\r\n_Daguerreotype_ from M. Daguerre, a Frenchman, who is supposed to have\r\nbeen the first discoverer, and who received a large premium from the\r\nFrench government for disclosing the process, and making the discovery\r\npublic. Several improvements and modifications, in reference to the\r\npreparation of the plates, have been made since the discovery was first\r\nannounced, about the beginning of 1839; and the pictures formed on this\r\nprinciple, are frequently distinguished by the name of _Photogenic_\r\ndrawings; and are now exhibited at most of our public scientific\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThis new science or art, has been distinguished by different names.\r\nIt was first called _Photography_, from two Greek words, signifying\r\n_writing by light_: it was afterwards called the art of _Photogenic\r\nDrawing_, or drawing produced by light. M. Daguerre gave it the name\r\nof _Heliography_, or _writing by the sun_, all which appellatives\r\nare derived from the Greek, and are expressive, in some degree, of\r\nthe nature of the process. We shall, however, make use of the term\r\nDaguerreotype, derived from the name of the inventor.\r\n\r\nAs it does not fall within our plan to give any minute descriptions of\r\nthe Daguerreotype process, we shall just give a few general hints in\r\nreference to it, referring those who wish for particular details, to\r\nthe separate treatises which have been published respecting it. The\r\nfirst thing necessary to be attended to in this art is, the preparation\r\nof the plate on which the drawing is to be made. The plate consists\r\nof a thin leaf of copper, plated with silver; both metals together,\r\nnot being thicker than a card. The object of the copper is simply to\r\nsupport the silver, which must be the purest that can be procured. But\r\nthough the copper should be no thicker than to serve the purpose of\r\nsupport, it is necessary that it should be so thick as to prevent the\r\nplate from being warped, which would produce a distortion of the images\r\ntraced upon it. This plate must be polished;--and for this purpose, the\r\nfollowing articles are required--a phial of olive oil--some very fine\r\ncotton--pumice-powder, ground till it is almost impalpable, and tied up\r\nin a piece of fine muslin, thin enough to let the powder pass through\r\nwithout touching the plate when the bag is shaken. A little nitric acid\r\ndiluted with sixteen times, by measure, its own quantity of water--a\r\nframe of wire on which to place the plate, when being heated--a spirit\r\nlamp to make the plate hot--a small box with inclined sides within, and\r\nhaving a lid to shut it up close--and a square board large enough to\r\nhold the drawing, and having catches at the side to keep it steady.\r\n\r\nTo the above prerequisites, a good _Camera Obscura_ is, of course,\r\nessentially necessary. This instrument should be large enough to admit\r\nthe plate of the largest drawing intended to be taken. The lens which\r\nforms the image of the object, should, if possible, be _achromatic_,\r\nand of a considerable diameter. In an excellent instrument of this\r\ndescription, now before me, the lens is an achromatic, about 3 inches\r\ndiameter, but capable of being contracted to a smaller aperture. Its\r\nfocal distance is about 17 inches; and the box, exclusive of the tube\r\nwhich contains the lens, is 15 inches long, 13-1/2 inches broad, and\r\n11 inches deep. It forms a beautiful and well-defined picture of every\r\nwell-enlightened object to which it is directed.\r\n\r\nBefore the plate is placed in the camera, there are certain operations\r\nto be performed. 1. The surface of the plate should be made perfectly\r\nsmooth, or highly polished. For this purpose, it must be laid flat,\r\nwith the silver side upwards, upon several folds of paper for a\r\nbedding; and having been well polished in the usual way, the surface\r\nmust be powdered equally and carefully with fine pumice enclosed in\r\nthe muslin bag. Then taking a little cotton wool, dipped in olive\r\noil, it must be rubbed over the plate with rounding strokes, and then\r\ncrossing them by others which commence at right angles with the first.\r\nThis process must be repeated frequently, changing the cotton, and\r\nrenewing the pumice powder every time. A small portion of cotton must\r\nnow be moistened with the diluted nitric acid, and applied equally\r\nto the whole surface. The next thing to be done is to make the plate\r\nthoroughly and equally hot, by holding the plate with a pair of\r\npincers, by the corner, over a charcoal fire, and when the plate is\r\nsufficiently hot, a white coating will be observed on the silver, which\r\nindicates that that part of the operation is finished. An even cold\r\nsurface is next wanted, such as a metallic plate cooled almost to the\r\nfreezing point by muriate of soda, and to this the heated plate must be\r\nsuddenly transferred.\r\n\r\n2. The next operation is to give the plate a coating of _Iodine_. This\r\nis accomplished by fixing the plate upon a board, and then putting it\r\ninto a box containing a little dish with iodine divided into small\r\npieces, with its face downward, and supported with small brackets at\r\nthe corners. In this position, the plate must remain till it assume\r\n_a full gold colour_, through the condensation of the iodine on its\r\nsurface--which process should be conducted in a darkened apartment.\r\nThe requisite time for the condensation of the iodine varies from\r\nfive minutes to half an hour. When this process is satisfactorily\r\naccomplished, the plate should be immediately fixed in a frame with\r\ncatches and bands, and placed in the Camera; and the transference from\r\none receptacle to another should be made as quickly as possible, and\r\nwith only so much light as will enable the operator to see what he is\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n3. The next operation is to obtain the drawing. Having placed the\r\nCamera in front of the scene to be represented, and the lens being\r\nadjusted to the proper focus, the ground-glass of the Camera is\r\nwithdrawn, and the prepared plate is substituted for it; and the\r\nwhole is left till the natural images are drawn by the natural light\r\nfrom the object. The time necessary to leave the plate for a complete\r\ndelineation of the objects, depends upon the intensity of the light.\r\nObjects in the shade will require more time for their delineation\r\nthan those in the broad light. The full clear light of the south of\r\nEurope, Spain, Italy, and particularly, the more glowing brilliancy\r\nof tropical countries, will effect the object much more speedily than\r\nthe duller luminosity of a northern clime. Some hours of the day are\r\nlikewise more favourable than others. Daguerre states, that ‘the most\r\nfavourable, is from 7 A.M. to 3 o’clock P.M., and\r\nthat a drawing could be effected in Paris in 3 or 4 minutes, in June\r\nand July, which would require 5 or 6, in May and August, and 7 or 8 in\r\nApril and September.’ In the progress of this art, at the present time,\r\nportraits and other objects are frequently delineated in the course of\r\na few seconds.\r\n\r\n4. Immediately after removing the plate from the Camera, it is next\r\nplaced over the vapour of mercury, which is placed in a cup at the\r\nbottom of a box, and a spirit lamp applied to its bottom, till the\r\ntemperature rise to 140 of Fahrenheit. This process is intended to\r\nbring out the image, which is not visible when withdrawn from the\r\nCamera; but in the course of a few minutes a faint tracery will\r\nbegin to appear, and in a very short time the figure will be clearly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n5. The next operation is _to fix the impression_. In order to this, the\r\ncoating on which the design was impressed must be removed, to preserve\r\nit from being decomposed by the rays of light. For this purpose, the\r\nplate is placed in a trough containing common water, plunging, and\r\nwithdrawing it immediately, and then plunging it into a solution of\r\nsalt and water, till the yellow coating has disappeared.\r\n\r\nSuch is a very brief sketch of the _photogenic_ processes of Daguerre.\r\nOther substances, however, more easily prepared, have been recommended\r\nby Mr. Talbot, F.R.S., who appears, about the same time, to have\r\ninvented a process somewhat similar to that of Daguerre. The following\r\nare his directions for the preparation of _Photogenic Paper_.\r\n\r\nThe paper is to be dipped into a solution of salt in water, in the\r\nproportion of half an ounce of salt to half a pint of water. Let\r\nthe superfluous moisture drain off, and then, laying the paper upon\r\na clean cloth, _dab_ it gently with a napkin, so as to prevent the\r\nsalt collecting in one spot more than another. The paper is then to\r\nbe pinned down by two of its corners on a drawing board, by means\r\nof common pins, and one side washed or wetted with the Photogenic\r\nfluid, using the brush prepared for that purpose, and taking care to\r\ndistribute it equally. Next dry the paper as rapidly as you can at\r\nthe fire, and it will be fit for use for most purposes. If, when the\r\npaper is exposed to the sun’s rays, it should assume an irregular tint,\r\na very thin extra wash of the fluid will render the colour uniform,\r\nand at the same time somewhat darker. Should it be required to make a\r\nmore sensitive description of paper, after the first application of\r\nthe fluid, the solution of salt should be applied, and the paper dried\r\nat the fire. Apply a second wash of the fluid, and dry it at the fire\r\nagain: employ the salt a third time, dry it,--and one application more\r\nof the fluid will, when dried, have made the paper extremely sensitive.\r\nWhen slips of such papers, differently prepared, are exposed to the\r\naction of day light, those which are soonest affected by the light, by\r\nbecoming dark, are the best prepared.\r\n\r\nWhen photogenic drawings are finished in a perfect way, the designs\r\nthen taken on the plate or paper are exceedingly beautiful and\r\ncorrect, and will bear to be inspected with a considerable magnifying\r\npower, so that the most minute portions of the objects delineated may\r\nbe distinctly perceived. We have seen portraits, finished in this way\r\nby a London artist, with an accuracy which the best miniature painter\r\ncould never attempt--every feature being so distinct, as to bear being\r\nviewed with a deep magnifier. And in landscapes and buildings, such\r\nis the delicacy and accuracy of such representations, that the marks\r\nof the chisel and the crevices in the stones may frequently be seen\r\nby applying a magnifying lens to the picture; so that we may justly\r\nexclaim, in the words of the Poet: ‘Who can paint like nature!.’ That\r\nLIGHT--which is the first-born of Deity, which pervades all\r\nspace, and illuminates all worlds--in the twinkling of an eye, and with\r\nan accuracy which no art can imitate, depicts every object in its exact\r\nform and proportions, superior to every thing that human genius can\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nThe Photogenic art, in its progress, will doubtless be productive of\r\nmany highly interesting and beneficial effects. It affords us the power\r\nof representing, by an accurate and rapid process, all the grand and\r\nbeautiful objects connected with our globe--the landscapes peculiar\r\nto every country--the lofty ranges of mountains which distinguish\r\nAlpine regions--the noble edifices which art has reared--the monumental\r\nremains of antiquity--and every other object which it would be\r\ninteresting for human beings to contemplate; so that in the course\r\nof time, the general scenery of our world, in its prominent parts,\r\nmight be exhibited to almost every eye. The commission of the French\r\nChambers, when referring to this art, has the following remark, ‘To\r\ncopy the millions upon millions of hieroglyphics which cover even\r\nthe exterior of the great monuments of Thebes and Memphis, of Carnac,\r\n&c., would require scores of years and legions of designers. By the\r\nassistance of the Daguerreotype, a single man could finish that immense\r\nwork.’--This instrument lays down objects, which the visual organs\r\nof man would overlook, or might be unable to perceive, with the same\r\nminuteness and nicety, that it delineates the most prominent features\r\nof a landscape. The time-stained excrescences on a tree, the blades\r\nof grass, the leaf of a rose, the neglected weed, the moss on the\r\nsummit of a lofty tower, and similar objects, are traced with the same\r\naccuracy as the larger objects in the surrounding scene.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, likewise, that this art (still in its\r\ninfancy) when it approximates to perfection, may enable us to take\r\nrepresentations of the sublime objects in the heavens. The sun affords\r\nsufficient light for this purpose; and there appears no insurmountable\r\nobstacle in taking, in this way, a highly magnified picture of that\r\nluminary, which shall be capable of being again magnified by a powerful\r\nmicroscope. It is by no means improbable, from experiments that have\r\nhitherto been made, that we may obtain an accurate delineation of\r\nthe lunar world from the moon herself. The plated disks prepared by\r\nDaguerre receive impressions from the action of the lunar rays to such\r\nan extent as permits the hope that photographic charts of the moon\r\nmay soon be obtained; and, if so, they will excel in accuracy all the\r\ndelineations of this orb that have hitherto been obtained; and if they\r\nshould bear a microscopic power, objects may be perceived on the lunar\r\nsurface which have hitherto been invisible. Nor is it impossible that\r\nthe planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, may be delineated in\r\nthis way, and objects discovered which cannot be descried by means of\r\nthe telescope. It might perhaps be considered as beyond the bounds of\r\nprobability to expect that even distant _Nebulæ_, might thus be fixed,\r\nand a delineation of their objects produced which shall be capable of\r\nbeing magnified by microscopes. But we ought to consider that the art\r\nis yet only in its infancy--that plates of a more delicate nature than\r\nthose hitherto used, may yet be prepared, and that other properties of\r\nlight may yet be discovered, which shall facilitate such designs. For,\r\nwe ought now to set no boundaries to the discoveries of science, and to\r\nthe practical applications of scientific discovery which genius and art\r\nmay accomplish.\r\n\r\nIn short, this invention leads to the conclusion, that we have\r\nnot yet discovered all the wonderful properties of that Luminous\r\nAgent which pervades the universe, and which unveils to us its\r\nbeauties and sublimities--and that thousands of admirable objects\r\nand agencies may yet be disclosed to our view through the medium of\r\nlight, as philosophical investigators advance in their researches\r\nand discoveries. In the present instance, as well as in many others,\r\nit evidently appears, that the Creator intends, in the course of his\r\nprovidence, by means of scientific researches, gradually to open to the\r\nview of the inhabitants of our world the wonders, the beauties and the\r\nsublimities of his vast creation, to manifest his infinite wisdom, and\r\nhis superabundant goodness, and to raise our souls to the contemplation\r\nand the love of Him who is the original source of all that is glorious\r\nand beneficent in the scene of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE OPTICAL ANGLE, AND THE APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF OBJECTS.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the principle on which telescopes represent\r\ndistant objects as magnified, it may be expedient to explain what is\r\nmeant by the angle of vision, and the apparent magnitudes under which\r\ndifferent objects appear, and the same object, when placed at different\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 40_*.]\r\n\r\nThe optical angle is the angle contained under two right lines drawn\r\nfrom the extreme points of an object to the eye. Thus AEB or CED (fig.\r\n40.) is the optical or visual angle, or the angle under which the\r\nobject AB or CD, appears to the eye at E. These two objects, being at\r\ndifferent distances, are seen under the same angle, although CD is\r\nevidently larger than AB. On the retina of the eye, their images are\r\nexactly of the same size, and so is the still larger object FG.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 41._]\r\n\r\nThe _apparent magnitude_ of objects denotes their magnitude as they\r\nappear to us, in contradistinction from their real or true magnitude,\r\nand it is measured by the visual angle; for whatever objects are seen\r\nunder the same or equal angles _appear_ equal, however different their\r\nreal magnitudes. If a half-crown or half-dollar be placed at about 120\r\nyards from the eye, it is just perceptible as a visible point, and its\r\napparent magnitude, or the angle under which it is seen, is very small.\r\nAt the distance of thirty or forty yards, its bulk appears sensibly\r\nincreased, and we perceive it to be a round body; at the distance\r\nof six or eight yards, we can see the king or queen’s head engraved\r\nupon it; and at the distance of eight or ten inches from the eye it\r\nwill appear so large, that it will seem to cover a large building\r\nplaced within the distance of a quarter of a mile, in other words, the\r\napparent magnitude of the half-crown held at such a distance, will more\r\nthan equal that of such a building, in the picture on the retina, owing\r\nto the increase of the optical angle. If we suppose A (fig. 41.) to\r\nrepresent the apparent size of the half-crown at nine yards distance,\r\nthen we say it is seen under the small angle FED. B will represent its\r\napparent magnitude at 4-1/2 yards distant under the angle HEG, and the\r\ncircle C, its apparent magnitude at 3 yards distant, under the large\r\nangle KEI.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 42._]\r\n\r\nThis may be otherwise illustrated by the following figure. Let AB (fig.\r\n42.) be an object viewed directly by the eye QR. From each extremity A\r\nand B draw the lines AN,BM, intersecting each other in the crystalline\r\nhumour in I: then is AIB the optical angle which is the measure of the\r\napparent magnitude or length of the object AB. From an inspection of\r\nthis figure, it will evidently appear that the apparent magnitudes of\r\nobjects will vary according to their distances. Thus AB, CD, EF, the\r\nreal magnitudes of which are unequal, may be situated at such distances\r\nfrom the eye, as to have their _apparent_ magnitudes all equal, and\r\noccupying the same space on the retina MN, as here represented. In like\r\nmanner, objects of equal magnitude, placed at unequal distances, will\r\nappear unequal. The objects AB and GH which are equal, being situated\r\nat different distances from the eye, GH will appear under the large\r\nangle TIV, or as large as an object TV, situated at the same place as\r\nthe object AB, while AB appears under the smaller angle AIB. Therefore\r\nthe object GH is _apparently_ greater than the object AB, though it is\r\nonly equal to it. Hence it appears that we have no certain standard of\r\nthe _true magnitude_ of objects, by our visual perception abstractly\r\nconsidered, but only of the _proportions_ of magnitude.\r\n\r\nIn reference to apparent magnitudes, we scarcely ever judge any object\r\nto be so great or so small as it appears to be, or that there is so\r\ngreat a disparity in the visible magnitude of two equal bodies at\r\ndifferent distances from the eye. Thus, for example, suppose two men,\r\neach six feet 3 inches high, to stand directly before us, one at the\r\ndistance of a pole, or 5-1/2 yards, and the other at the distance of\r\n100 poles, or 550 yards--we should observe a considerable difference in\r\ntheir apparent size, but we should scarcely suppose, at first sight,\r\nthat the one nearest the eye appeared a hundred times greater than the\r\nother, or that, while the nearest one appeared 6 feet 3 inches high,\r\nthe remote one appeared only about _three fourths of an inch_. Yet\r\nsuch is in reality the case; and not only so, but the visible bulk\r\nor area of the one is to that of the other, as the square of these\r\nnumbers, namely as 10,000 to 1; the man nearest us presenting to the\r\neye a magnitude or surface ten thousand times greater than that of the\r\nother. Again, suppose two chairs standing in a large room, the one\r\n21 feet distance from us, and the other 3 feet--the one nearest us\r\nwill appear 7 times larger both in length and breadth, than the more\r\ndistant one, and consequently, its visible area 49 times greater. If\r\nI hold up my finger at 9 inches distant from my eye, it seems to cover\r\na large town a mile and a half in extent, situated at 3 miles distant;\r\nconsequently, the apparent magnitude of my finger, at 9 inches distant\r\nfrom the organ of vision, is greater than that of the large town at 3\r\nmiles distance, and forms a larger picture on the retina of the eye.\r\nWhen I stand at the distance of a foot from my window, and look through\r\none of the panes to a village less than a quarter of a mile distant,\r\nI see, through that pane, nearly the whole extent of the village,\r\ncomprehending two or three hundred houses; consequently, the apparent\r\nmagnitude of the pane is equal to nearly the extent of the village,\r\nand all the buildings it contains do not appear larger than the pane\r\nof glass in the window, otherwise, the houses and other objects which\r\ncompose the village could not be seen through that single pane. For, if\r\nwe suppose a line drawn from one end of the village, passing through\r\nthe one side of the pane, and another line drawn from the other end,\r\nand passing through the other side of the pane to the eye, these lines\r\nwould form the optical angle under which the pane of glass and the\r\nvillage appears. If the pane of glass be fourteen inches broad, and\r\nthe length of the village 2640 yards, or half a mile--this last lineal\r\nextent is 6,788 times greater than the other, and yet they have the\r\nsame _apparent_ magnitude in the case supposed.\r\n\r\nHence we may learn the absurdity and futility of attempting to\r\ndescribe the extent of spaces in the heavens, by saying, that a\r\ncertain phenomenon was two or three feet or yards distant from\r\nanother, or that the tail of a comet appeared several yards in length.\r\nSuch representations can convey no definite ideas in relation to\r\nsuch magnitudes, unless it be specified at what distance from the\r\neye, the foot or yard is supposed to be placed. If a rod, a yard\r\nin length, be held at nine inches from the eye, it will subtend an\r\nangle, or cover a space in the heavens, equal to more than one fourth\r\nof the circumference of the sky, or about one hundred degrees. If\r\nit be eighteen inches from the eye, it will cover a space equal to\r\nfifty degrees; if at three feet, twenty-five degrees, and so on in\r\nproportion to the distance from the eye; so that we can form no correct\r\nconceptions of apparent spaces or distances in the heavens, when we\r\nare merely told that two stars, for example, appear to be three yards\r\ndistant from each other. The only definite measure we can use, in such\r\ncases, is that of degrees. The sun and moon are about half a degree\r\nin apparent diameter, and the distance between the extreme stars in\r\n_Orion’s belt_, three degrees, which measures being made familiar\r\nto the eye, may be applied to other spaces of the heavens, and an\r\napproximate idea conveyed of the relative distances of objects in the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated above, it is evident that the magnitude\r\nof objects may be considered in different points of view. The true\r\ndimensions of an object, considered in itself, give what is called its\r\n_real_ or _absolute magnitude_; and the opening of the visual angle\r\ndetermines the _apparent magnitude_. The real magnitude, therefore, is\r\na constant quantity; but the apparent magnitude varies continually with\r\nthe distance, real or imaginary; and therefore, if we always judged\r\nof the dimensions of an object from its apparent magnitude, every\r\nthing around us would, in this respect, be undergoing very sensible\r\nvariations, which might lead us into strange and serious mistakes. A\r\nfly, near enough to the eye, might appear under an angle as great as\r\nan elephant at the distance of twenty feet, and the one be mistaken for\r\nthe other. A giant eight feet high, seen at the distance of twenty-four\r\nfeet, would not appear taller than a child two feet in height, at the\r\ndistance of six feet; for both would be seen nearly under the same\r\nangle. But our experience generally prevents us from being deceived by\r\nsuch illusions. By the help of touch, and by making allowance for the\r\ndifferent distances at which we see particular objects, we learn to\r\ncorrect the ideas we might otherwise form from attending to the optical\r\nangle alone, especially in the case of objects that are near us. By the\r\nsense of touch we acquire an impression of the distance of an object;\r\nthis impression combines itself with that of the apparent magnitude,\r\nso that the impression which represents to us the real magnitude is\r\nthe product of these two elements. When the objects, however, are at\r\na great distance, it is more difficult to form a correct estimate\r\nof their true magnitudes. The visual angles are so small, that they\r\nprevent comparison; and the estimated bulks of the objects depend in\r\na great measure upon the _apparent_ magnitudes; and thus an object\r\nsituated at a great distance, appears to us much smaller than it is\r\nin reality. We also estimate objects to be nearer or farther distant\r\naccording as they are more or less clear, and our perception of them\r\nmore or less distinct and well defined; and likewise, when several\r\nobjects intervene between us and the object we are particularly\r\nobserving. We make a sort of addition of all the estimated distances\r\nof intermediate objects, in order to form a total distance of the\r\nremote object, which in this case appears to be farther off than if the\r\nintervening space were unoccupied. It is generally estimated that no\r\nterrestrial object can be distinctly perceived, if the visual angle it\r\nsubtends be less than _one minute of a degree_; and that most objects\r\nbecome indistinct, when the angle they subtend at the pupil of the eye\r\nis less than six minutes.\r\n\r\nWe have deemed it expedient to introduce the above remarks on the\r\napparent magnitude of objects, because the principal use of a telescope\r\nis to increase the angle of vision, or to represent objects under a\r\nlarger angle than that under which they appear to the naked eye, so as\r\nto render the view of distant objects more distinct, and to exhibit to\r\nthe organ of vision those objects which would otherwise be invisible.\r\nA telescope may be said to enlarge an object just as many times as the\r\nangle under which the instrument represents it, is greater than that\r\nunder which it appears to the unassisted eye. Thus the moon appears to\r\nthe naked eye under an angle of about half a degree; consequently a\r\ntelescope magnifies 60 times if it represents that orb under an angle\r\nof 30 degrees; and if it magnified 180 times, it would exhibit the moon\r\nunder an angle of 90 degrees, which would make her appear to fill half\r\nof the visible heavens, or the space which intervenes from the horizon\r\nto the zenith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF REFRACTING TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of telescopes, corresponding to two modes of\r\nvision, namely, those which perform their office by _refraction_\r\nthrough lenses, and those which magnify distant objects by _reflection_\r\nfrom mirrors. The telescope which is constructed with lenses, produces\r\nits effects solely by refracted light, and is called a Dioptric, _or\r\nrefracting telescope_. The other kind of telescope produces its effects\r\npartly by reflection, and partly by refraction, and is composed both\r\nof mirrors and lenses; but the mirrors form the principal part of the\r\ntelescope; and therefore such instruments are denominated _reflecting\r\ntelescopes_. In this chapter I shall describe the various kinds of\r\n_refracting_ telescopes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT 1.--THE GALILEAN TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThis telescope is named after the celebrated Galileo, who first\r\nconstructed, and probably _invented_ it in the year 1609. It consists\r\nof only two glasses, a _convex_ glass next the object, and a _concave_\r\nnext the eye. The convex is called the _object-glass_, and the concave\r\nto which the eye is applied, is called the _eye-glass_. Let C (fig.\r\n43.) represent the convex object-glass, presented to any object in the\r\ndirection DEI, so that the rays fall parallel upon it;--if these rays,\r\nafter passing through it, were not intercepted by the concave lens\r\nK, they would pass on, and cross each other in the focus F, where an\r\ninverted image of the object would be formed. But the concave lens K,\r\nthe virtual focus of which is at F, being interposed, the rays are not\r\nsuffered to converge to that point, but are made less convergent,[19]\r\nand enter the pupil almost parallel, as GH, and are converged by the\r\nhumours of the eye to their proper foci on the retina. The object,\r\nthrough this telescope, is seen upright, or in its natural position,\r\nbecause the rays are not suffered to come to a focus, so as to form an\r\ninverted picture. The concave eye-glass is placed as far within the\r\nfocus of the object-glass, as is equal to its own virtual focus; and\r\nthe magnifying power is as the focal length of the object-glass to\r\nthat of the eye-glass, that is, as CF to BF. Thus, suppose the focus of\r\nthe object-glass to be 10 inches, and the focus of the eye-glass to be\r\n1 inch, the magnifying power will be 10 times--which is always found by\r\ndividing the focal length of the object-glass by that of the eye-glass.\r\nThe interval between the two glasses, in this case, will be 9 inches,\r\nwhich is the length of the telescope, and the objects seen through it\r\nwill appear under an angle ten times greater than they do to the naked\r\neye. These propositions might be proved mathematically; but the process\r\nis somewhat tedious and intricate, and might not fully be understood\r\nby general readers. I shall therefore only mention some of the general\r\nproperties of this telescope, which is now seldom used, except for the\r\npurpose of _opera-glasses_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 43_]\r\n\r\n1. The focal distance of the object-glass must be greater than that of\r\nthe eye-glass, otherwise it would not magnify an object: if the focal\r\ndistance of the eye-glass were greater than that of the object-glass,\r\nit would diminish objects, instead of magnifying them. 2. The visible\r\narea of the object is greater, the nearer the eye is to the glass; and\r\nit depends on the diameter of the pupil of the eye, and on the breadth\r\nof the object-glass; consequently the field of view in this telescope\r\nis very small. 3. The distinctness of vision in this construction\r\nof a telescope exceeds that of almost any other. This arises from\r\nthe rays of light proceeding from the object directly through the\r\nlenses, _without crossing_ or intersecting each other; whereas in the\r\ncombination of convex lenses, they intersect one another to form an\r\nimage in the focus of the object-glass, and this image is magnified by\r\nthe eye-glass with all its imperfections and distortions. The thinness\r\nof the centre of the concave lens also contributes to distinctness.\r\n4. Although the field of view in this telescope is very small, yet\r\nwhere no other telescope can be procured, it might be made of such a\r\nlength as to show the spots on the Sun, the crescent of Venus, the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, and the ring of Saturn; and, requiring only two\r\nglasses, it is the cheapest of all telescopes. It has been found that\r\nan object-lens 5 feet focal distance, will bear a concave eye-glass of\r\nonly 1 inch focal distance, and will consequently magnify the diameters\r\nof the planets 60 times, and their surfaces 3600 times, which is\r\nsufficient to show the phenomena now stated. And, although only a small\r\nportion of the sun and moon can be seen at once, yet Jupiter and all\r\nhis satellites may sometimes be seen at one view; but there is some\r\ndifficulty in finding objects with such telescopes. 5. Opera-glasses,\r\nwhich are always of this construction, have the object-lens generally\r\nabout 6 inches focus and 1 inch diameter, with a concave eye-glass of\r\nabout 2 inches focus. These glasses magnify about 3 times in diameter,\r\nhave a pretty large field, and produce very distinct vision. When\r\nadjusted to the eye, they are about 4 inches in length. To the object\r\nend of an opera-glass there is sometimes attached a plane mirror,\r\nplaced at an angle of 45 degrees, for the purpose of viewing objects on\r\neither side of us. By this means, in a theatre or assembly, we can take\r\na view of any person without his having the least suspicion of it, as\r\nthe glass is directed in quite a different direction. The instrument\r\nwith this appendage is sometimes called a _Polemoscope_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 2.--THE COMMON ASTRONOMICAL REFRACTING TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical telescope is the most simple construction of a\r\ntelescope, composed of convex lenses only, of which there are but\r\ntwo essentially necessary, though a third is sometimes added to\r\nthe eye-piece for the purpose of enlarging the field of view. Its\r\nconstruction will be easily understood from a description of the\r\nfollowing figure. Its two essential parts are, an object-glass AD,\r\nand an eye-glass EY, so combined in a tube that the focus F of the\r\nobject-glass is exactly coincident with the focus of the eye-glass.\r\nLet OB (fig. 44.) represent a distant object, from which rays nearly\r\nparallel proceed to the object-lens AD. The rays passing through this\r\nlens will cross at F, and form an image of the object at IM. This image\r\nforms as it were an object to the eye-glass EY, which is of a short\r\nfocal distance, and the eye is thus enabled to contemplate the object\r\nas if it were brought much nearer than it is in reality. For the rays,\r\nwhich after crossing proceed in a divergent state, fall upon the lens\r\nEY, as if they proceeded from a real object situated at F. All that\r\nis effected therefore, by such a telescope is, to form an image of\r\na distant object by means of the object-lens, and then to give the\r\neye such assistance as is necessary for viewing that image as near as\r\npossible, so that the angle it shall subtend at the eye shall be very\r\nlarge compared with the angle which the object itself would subtend in\r\nthe same situation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 44._]\r\n\r\nHere it may be expedient to explain, 1. how this arrangement of glasses\r\nshows distant objects distinctly, and 2. the reason why objects appear\r\nmagnified when seen through it. As to the first particular, it may be\r\nproved as follows:--The rays OA and BD, which are parallel before they\r\nfall upon the object-glass, are by this glass refracted and united\r\nat its focus: In order, then, to distinct vision, the eye-glass must\r\nre-establish the parallelism of the rays,--which is effected by placing\r\nthe eye-glass so that its focus may be at F, and consequently the rays\r\nwill proceed from it parallel to each other and fall upon the eye in\r\nthat direction. For distinct vision is produced by _parallel_ rays. 2.\r\nThe reason why the object appears magnified will appear, if we consider\r\nthat, if the eye viewed the object from the centre of the object-glass,\r\nit would see it under the angle OCB; let OC and BC then be produced\r\nto the focus of the glass, they will then limit the image IM formed\r\nin the focus. If then, two parallel rays are supposed to proceed to\r\nthe eye-glass EY, they will be converged to its focus H, and the eye\r\nwill see the image under the angle EHY. The apparent magnitude of the\r\nobject, therefore, as seen by the naked eye, is to the magnitude of the\r\nimage as seen through the telescope, as OCB to EHY, or as the distance\r\nCF to the distance FG, in other words, _as the focal length of the\r\nobject-glass to that of the eye-glass_.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from the figure, that, through this telescope, all\r\nobjects will appear _inverted_; since the object OB is depicted by the\r\nobject-glass in an inverted position at IM, and in this position is\r\nviewed by the eye-glass EY; and, therefore this kind of telescope is\r\nnot well adapted for viewing terrestrial objects, since it exhibits\r\nthe tops of trees, houses, and other objects as undermost, and the\r\nheads of people as pointing downwards. But this circumstance is of\r\nno consequence with respect to the heavenly bodies, since they are\r\nround, and it can make little difference to an observer which side\r\nof a globular body appears uppermost or undermost. All astronomical\r\nrefracting telescopes invert objects; but they are preferred to any\r\nother telescopes, because they have few glasses, and consequently more\r\nlight. This telescope however, can be transformed into a common day\r\ntelescope for land objects, by the addition of two other eye-glasses,\r\nas we shall afterwards explain; but in this case a quantity of light is\r\nlost by refraction at each lens; for there is scarcely any transparent\r\nsubstance that transmits all the rays of light that fall upon it.\r\n\r\nThe _magnifying power_ of this telescope is found _by dividing the\r\nfocal distance of the object-glass by the focal distance of the\r\neye-glass_: the quotient gives the magnifying power, or the number of\r\ntimes that the object seen through the telescope, appears larger or\r\nnearer than to the naked eye. Thus, for example, if the focal distance\r\nof the object-glass be 28 inches, and the focal distance of the\r\neye-glass 1 inch, the magnifying power will be 28 times. If we would\r\nenlarge the telescope and select an object-glass 10 feet, or 120 inches\r\nfocus, an eye-glass of 2 inches focal length might be applied, and\r\nthen the diameter of objects would be magnified 60 times, and their\r\nsurfaces 3600 times. If we would use an object-glass of 100 feet, it\r\nwould be necessary to select an eye-glass about 6 inches focus, and\r\nthe magnifying power would be 200 times, equal to 1200 inches divided\r\nby 6. Since, then, the power of magnifying depends on the proportion\r\nof the focal length of the object and eye-glasses, and this proportion\r\nmay be varied to any degree, it may seem strange to some that a short\r\ntelescope of this kind will not answer that purpose as well as a long\r\none. For instance, it may be asked why an object-glass of 10 feet\r\nfocus, may not be made to magnify as much, as one of 100 feet focal\r\nlength, by using an eye-glass of half an inch focus, in which case,\r\nthe magnifying power would be 240 times? But it is to be considered,\r\nthat if the power of magnifying be increased, while the length of the\r\ntelescope remains the same, it is necessary to diminish the focal\r\nlength of the eye-glass in the same proportion, and this cannot be\r\ndone on account of the great distortion and colouring which would then\r\nappear in the image, arising both from the deep convexity of the lens\r\nand the different refrangibility of the rays of light. It is found\r\nthat the length of common refracting telescopes must be increased in\r\nproportion to the square of the increase of their magnifying power; so\r\nthat in order to magnify twice as much as before, with the same light\r\nand distinctness, the telescope must be lengthened four times; to\r\nmagnify 3 times as much, 9 times; and to magnify four times as much,\r\nsixteen times; that is--suppose a telescope of 3 feet to magnify 33\r\ntimes,--in order to procure a power four times as great, or 132 times,\r\nwe must extend the telescope to the length of 48 feet, or 16 times the\r\nlength of the other. Much likewise depends upon the breadth or aperture\r\nof the object-glass. If it be too small, there will not be sufficient\r\nlight to illuminate the object; and if it be too large, the redundance\r\nof light will produce confusion in the image.\r\n\r\nThe following table, constructed originally by Huygens, and which I\r\nhave re-calculated and corrected, shows the linear aperture, the focal\r\ndistance of the eye-glass, and the magnifying power of astronomical\r\ntelescopes of different lengths, which may serve as a guide to those\r\nwho wish to construct telescopes of this description.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+----------------------------------+-----------\r\n  Focal distance | Linear aperture   Focal distance | Magnifying\r\n     of the      |    of the            of the      |   power.\r\n  object-glass.  | object-glass.       eye-glass.   |\r\n  ---------------+-----------------+----------------+-----------\r\n      Feet.      |   Inch.

From this table it appears that, in order\r\nto obtain a magnifying power of 168 times, by this kind of telescope,\r\nit is requisite to have an object-glass of 70 feet focal distance,\r\nand an eye-glass five inches focus, and that the aperture of the\r\nobject-glass ought not to be more than about 4-1/2 inches diameter. To\r\nobtain a power of 220 times requires a length of 120 feet.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary view of the properties of this telescope. 1.\r\nThe object is always inverted. 2. The magnifying power is always in the\r\nproportion of the focal distance of the object-glass to the eye-glass.\r\n3. As the rays emerging from the eye-glass, should be rendered parallel\r\nfor every eye, there is a small sliding tube next the eye, which should\r\nbe pushed out or in till the object appears distinct. When objects\r\nare pretty near, this tube requires to be pulled out a little. These\r\ncircumstances require to be attended to in all telescopes. 4. The\r\napparent magnitude of an object is the same wherever the eye be placed,\r\nbut the visible area, or field of view, is the greatest when the eye\r\nis nearly at the focal distance of the eye-glass. 5. The visual angle\r\ndepends on the breadth of the eye-glass; for it is equal to the angle\r\nwhich the eye-glass subtends at the object-glass; but the breadth of\r\nthe eye-glass cannot be increased beyond a certain limit, without\r\nproducing colouring and distortion.\r\n\r\nIf the general principles on which this telescope is constructed\r\nbe thoroughly understood, it will be quite easy for the reader to\r\nunderstand the construction of all the other kinds of telescopes,\r\nwhether refracting or reflecting. A small astronomical telescope can be\r\nconstructed in a few moments, provided one has at hand the following\r\nlenses:--1. A common reading-glass, eight or ten inches focal distance;\r\n2. A common magnifying lens, such as watchmakers or botanists use, of\r\nabout 1-1/2 or 2 inches focus. Hold the reading-glass--suppose of ten\r\ninches focus--in the left hand opposite any object, and the magnifying\r\nlens of two inches focus, in the right hand near the eye, at twelve\r\ninches distance from the other in a direct line, and a telescope is\r\nformed which magnifies five times. I have frequently used this plan,\r\nwhen travelling, when no other telescope was at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 3.--THE AERIAL TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe Aerial is a refracting telescope of the kind we have now described,\r\nintended to be used without a tube in a dark night; for the use of a\r\ntube is not only to direct the glasses, but to make the place dark\r\nwhere the images are formed. It appears from the preceding table\r\ninserted above, that we cannot obtain a high magnifying power, with\r\nthe common astronomical telescope, without making it of an extreme\r\nlength, in which case the glasses are not manageable in tubes--which\r\nare either too slight and apt to bend, or too heavy and unwieldy if\r\nmade of wood, iron or other strong materials. The astronomers of the\r\nseventeenth century, feeling such inconveniences in making celestial\r\nobservations with long tubes, contrived a method of using the glasses\r\nwithout tubes. Hartsocker, an eminent optician, contrived to fix\r\nthem at the top of a tree, a high wall, or the roof of a house; but\r\nthe celebrated Huygens, who was not only an astronomer, but also an\r\nexcellent mechanic, made considerable improvements in the method of\r\nusing an object-glass without a tube. He placed it at the top of a\r\nvery long pole, having previously enclosed it in a short tube, which\r\nwas made to turn in all directions by means of a ball and socket. The\r\naxis of this tube he could command with a fine silken string, so as\r\nto bring it into a line with the axis of another short tube which he\r\nheld in his hand, and which contained the eye-glass. The following is\r\na more particular description of one of these telescopes. On the top\r\nof a long pole or mast _ab_ (fig. 45), is fixed a board moveable up\r\nand down in the channel _cd_: _e_ is a perpendicular arm fixed to it,\r\nand _ff_ is a transverse board that supports the object glass enclosed\r\nin the tube _i_, which is raised or lowered by means of the silk cord\r\n_rl_; _gg_ is an endless rope with a weight _h_, by which the apparatus\r\nof the object-glass is counterpoised; _kl_ is a stick fastened to the\r\ntube _i_; _m_ the ball and socket, by means of which the object-glass\r\nis moveable every way: and to keep it steady, there is a weight _n_\r\nsuspended by a wire; _l_ is a short wire to which the thread _rl_ is\r\ntied; _o_ is the tube which holds the eye-glass; _q_ the stick fixed\r\nto this tube, _s_ a leaden bullet, and _t_ a spool to wind the thread\r\non; _u_ is pins for the thread to pass through; _x_ the rest for the\r\nobserver to lean upon, and _y_ the lantern. Fig. 46 is an apparatus\r\ncontrived by M. de la Hire for managing the object-glass; but which it\r\nwould be too tedious particularly to describe. To keep off the dew from\r\nthe object-glass, it was sometimes included in a pasteboard tube, made\r\nof spongy paper, to absorb the humidity of the air. And to find an\r\nobject more readily, a broad annulus of white pasteboard was put over\r\nthe tube that carried the eye-glass; upon which the image of the object\r\nbeing painted, an assistant who perceived it, might direct the tube of\r\nthe eye-glass into its place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 45._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig 46._]\r\n\r\nSuch was the construction of the telescopes with which Hevelius,\r\nHuygens, Cassini, and other eminent astronomers of the seventeenth\r\ncentury made their principal discoveries. With such telescopes,\r\nHuygens discovered the fourth satellite of Saturn, and determined\r\nthat this planet was surrounded with a ring; and with the same kind\r\nof instrument Cassini detected the first, second, third, and fifth,\r\nsatellites of Saturn, and made his other discoveries. When the night\r\nwas very dark, they were obliged to make the object-glass visible,\r\nby means of a lantern so constructed as to throw the rays of light\r\nup to it in a parallel direction. In making such observations, they\r\nmust have taken incredible pains, endured much cold and fatigue,\r\nand subjected themselves to very great labour and expense--which\r\nalmost makes us wonder at the discoveries they were instrumental in\r\nbringing to light--and should make modern philosophers sensible of the\r\nobligations they are under to such men as Newton and Dollond, through\r\nwhose inventions such unwieldy instruments are no longer necessary.\r\nTelescopes of the description now stated were made of all sizes,\r\nfrom 30 to above 120 feet in length. Divini at Rome, and Campani at\r\nBologna, were famed as makers of the object-glasses of the long focal\r\ndistance to which we have alluded, who sold them for a great price,\r\nand took every method to keep the art of making them a secret. It was\r\nwith telescopes made by Campani, that Cassini made his discoveries.\r\nThey were made by the express order of Louis XIV, and were of 86, 100,\r\nand 136 Paris feet in focal length. M. Auzout made one object-glass\r\nof 600 feet focus; but he was never able to manage it, so as to make\r\nany practical observations with it. Hartsocker is said to have made\r\nsome of a still greater focal length. The famous aerial telescope of\r\nHuygens was 123 feet in focal length, with six inches of aperture. At\r\nhis death, he bequeathed it to the Royal Society of London, in whose\r\npossession it still remains. It required a pole of more than a hundred\r\nfeet high, on which to place the object-glass for general observations.\r\nIt was with this glass, that Dr. Derham made the observations to which\r\nhe alludes in his preface to his ‘Astro-Theology.’ When this glass\r\nwas in the possession of Mr. Cavendish, it was compared with one of\r\nMr. Dollond’s forty-six inch treble object-glass Achromatics, and the\r\ngentlemen who were present at the trial, said that ‘the Dwarf was\r\nfairly a match for the Giant.’ It magnified 218 times, and the trouble\r\nof managing it, was said to be extremely tiresome and laborious.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 4.--THE COMMON REFRACTING TELESCOPE FOR TERRESTRIAL OBJECTS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 47._]\r\n\r\nThis telescope is constructed on the same principle as the astronomical\r\ntelescope already described, with the addition of two or three glasses.\r\nIn fig. 47, OB represents a distant object, LN, the object glass, which\r\nforms the image IM in its focus, which is, of course, in an inverted\r\nposition, and, if the eye were applied at the lens EE, the object would\r\nappear, exactly as through the astronomical telescope, every object\r\nbeing apparently turned upside down. To remedy this inconvenience,\r\nthere are added two other glasses FF and GG, by which a second image is\r\nformed from the first, in the same position as the object. In order to\r\neffect this, the first of these two glasses, namely FF, is placed at\r\ntwice its focal distance from the former glass EE, and the other lens\r\nGG, next the eye, is placed at the same distance from FF. For all the\r\nthree glasses are supposed to be of the same focal distance. Now, the\r\nlens FF, being placed at twice the focal distance for parallel rays\r\nfrom EE, receives the pencils of parallel rays after they have crossed\r\neach other at X, and forms an image at _i m_ similar to that at IM and\r\nequal to it, but contrary in position, and consequently erect; which\r\nlast image is viewed by the lens GG, in the same manner as the first\r\nimage IM would be viewed by the lens EE. In this case, the image IM is\r\nconsidered as an object to the lens FF of which it forms a picture in\r\nits focus, in a reverse position from that of the first image, and of\r\ncourse, in the same position as the object.\r\n\r\nThe magnifying power of this telescope is determined precisely in\r\nthe same way as that of the astronomical telescope. Suppose the\r\nobject-glass to be thirty inches focal distance, and each of the\r\neye-glasses 1-1/2 inch focal distance, the magnifying power is in the\r\nproportion of 30 to 1-1/2, or 20 times, and the instrument is, of\r\ncourse, considerably longer than an astronomical telescope of the same\r\npower. The distance, in this case, between the object-glass and the\r\nfirst eye-glass EE is 31-1/2 inches; the distance between EE, and the\r\nsecond glass FF, is 3 inches, and the distance between FF and the glass\r\nGG next the eye, 3 inches; in all 37-1/2 inches, the whole length of\r\nthe telescope. Although it is usual to make use of three eye-glasses in\r\nthis telescope, yet two will cause the object to appear erect, and of\r\nthe same magnitude. For suppose the middle lens FF taken away, if the\r\nfirst lens EE be placed at X, which is double its focal distance from\r\nthe image IM, it will at the same distance X _m_, on the other side,\r\nform a secondary image _i m_ equal to the primary image IM, and also in\r\na contrary position. But such a combination of eye-glasses produces a\r\ngreat degree of colouring in the image, and therefore is seldom used.\r\nEven the combination now described, consisting of three lenses of equal\r\nfocal distances, is now almost obsolete, and has given place to a much\r\nbetter arrangement consisting of _four_ glasses, of different focal\r\ndistances--which shall be afterwards described.\r\n\r\nThe following figures, 48, 49, 50 represent the manner in which the\r\nrays of light are refracted through the glasses of the telescopes we\r\nhave now described. Fig. 48 represents the rays of light as they pass\r\nfrom the object to the eye in the Galilean telescope. After passing in\r\na parallel direction to the object-glass, they are refracted by that\r\nglass, and undergo a slight convergence in passing towards the concave\r\neye-glass, where they enter the eye in a parallel direction, but no\r\nimage is formed previous to their entering the eye, till they arrive\r\nat the retina. Fig. 49 represents the rays as they pass through the\r\nglasses of the astronomical telescope. The rays, after entering the\r\nobject-glass, proceed in a converging direction, till they arrive at\r\nits focus, about A, where an image of the object is formed; they then\r\nproceed diverging to the eye-glass, where they are rendered parallel,\r\nand enter the eye in that direction. Fig. 50 represents the rays as\r\nthey converge and diverge in passing through the four glasses of\r\nthe common day-telescope described above. After passing through the\r\nobject-glass, they converge towards B, where the first image is formed.\r\nThey then diverge towards the first eye-glass where they are rendered\r\nparallel; and passing through the second eye-glass, they again converge\r\nand form a second image at C; from which point they again diverge,\r\nand passing through the first eye-glass enter the eye in a parallel\r\ndirection. If the glasses of these telescopes were fixed on long pieces\r\nof wood, at their proper distances from each other, and placed in a\r\ndarkened room, when the sun is shining, the beam of the sun’s light\r\nwould pass through them in the same manner as here represented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 48._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 49._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 50._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 5.--TELESCOPE FORMED BY A SINGLE LENS.\r\n\r\nThis is a species of telescope altogether unnoticed by optical writers,\r\nso far as I know; nor has the property of a single lens in magnifying\r\ndistant objects been generally adverted to or recognised. It may not\r\ntherefore be inexpedient to state a few experiments which I have made\r\nin relation to this point. When we hold a spectacle-glass of a pretty\r\nlong focal distance--say, from 20 to 24 inches--close to the eye, and\r\ndirect it to distant objects, they do not appear sensibly magnified.\r\nBut if we hold the glass about 12 or 16 inches from our eye, we shall\r\nperceive a sensible degree of magnifying power, as if distant objects\r\nwere seen at less than half the distance at which they are placed. This\r\nproperty of a spectacle-glass I happened to notice when a boy, and, on\r\ndifferent occasions since that period have made several experiments on\r\nthe subject, some of which I shall here relate.\r\n\r\nWith the object-glass of a common refracting telescope 4-1/2 feet focal\r\ndistance, and 2-1/2 inches diameter, I looked at distant objects--my\r\neye being at about 3-1/2 feet from the lens, or about 10 or 12 inches\r\nwithin its focus--and it produced nearly the same effect as a telescope\r\nwhich magnifies the diameters of objects 5 or 6 times. With another\r\nlens 11 feet focal distance and 4 inches diameter--standing from it at\r\nthe distance of about 10 feet, I obtain a magnifying power of about 12\r\nor 14 times, which enables me to read the letters on the sign-posts\r\nof a village half a mile distant. Having some time ago procured a\r\nvery large lens 26 feet focal distance, and 11-1/2 inches diameter,\r\nI have tried with it various experiments of this kind upon different\r\nobjects. Standing at the distance of about 25 feet from it, I can see\r\ndistant objects through it magnified about 26 times in diameter, and\r\nconsequently 676 times in surface, and remarkably clear and distinct,\r\nso that I can distinguish the hour and minute hands of a public clock\r\nin a village two miles distant. This single lens, therefore answers the\r\npurpose of an ordinary telescope with a power of 26 times. In making\r\nsuch experiments our eye must always be _within_ the focus of the\r\nlens, at least 8 or 10 inches. The object will, indeed, be seen at any\r\ndistance from the glass within this limit; but the magnifying power is\r\ndiminished in proportion as we approach nearer to the glass. Different\r\neyes, too, will require to place themselves at different distances, so\r\nas to obtain the greatest degree of magnifying power with distinctness,\r\naccording as individuals are long or short-sighted.\r\n\r\nThis kind of telescope stands in no need of a tube, but only of a small\r\npedestal on which it may be placed on a table, nearly at the height\r\nof the eye, and that it be capable of a motion in a perpendicular\r\nor parallel direction, to bring it in a line with the eye and the\r\nobject. The principle on which the magnifying power, in this case, is\r\nproduced, is materially the same as that on which the performance of\r\nthe Galilean telescope depends. The eye of the observer serves instead\r\nof the concave lens in that instrument; and as the concave lens is\r\nplaced as much within the focus of the object-glass, as is equal to\r\nits own focal distance, so the eye, in these experiments, must be\r\nplaced at least its focal distance within the focus of the lens with\r\nwhich we are experimenting; and the magnifying power will be nearly\r\nin the proportion of the focal distance of the lens to the focal\r\ndistance of the eye. If, for example, the focal distance of the eye,\r\nor the distance at which we see to read distinctly, be 10 inches, and\r\nthe focal distance of the lens, 11 feet, the magnifying power will\r\nbe as 11 feet, or 132 inches to 10, that is, about 13 times. Let A\r\n(fig. 51.) represent the lens placed on a pedestal; the rays of light\r\npassing through this lens from distant objects will converge towards a\r\nfocus at F. If a person then, place his eye at E, a certain distance\r\nwithin the focal point, he will see distant objects magnified nearly in\r\nthe proportion of the focal distance of the lens to that of the eye;\r\nand when the lens is very broad--such as the 26 feet lens mentioned\r\nabove--two or three persons may look through it at once, though they\r\nwill not all see the same object. I have alluded above to a lens made\r\nby M. Azout of 600 feet focal distance. Were it possible to use such a\r\nlens for distant objects, it might represent them as magnified 5 or 600\r\ntimes, without the application of any eye-glass. In this way the aerial\r\ntelescope of Huygens would magnify objects above 100 times, which is\r\nabout half the magnifying power it produced with its eye-piece. Suppose\r\nAzout’s lens had been fitted up as a telescope, it would not have\r\nmagnified above 480 times, as it would have required an eye-glass of 14\r\nor 15 inches focal distance, whereas, without an eye-glass, it would\r\nhave magnified objects considerably above 500 times. It is not unlikely\r\nthat the species of telescope to which I have now adverted, constituted\r\none of those instruments for magnifying distant objects which were said\r\nto have been in the possession of certain persons long before their\r\ninvention in Holland, and by Galileo in Italy--to which I have referred\r\nin p. 182. Were this kind of telescope to be applied to the celestial\r\nbodies, it would require to be elevated upon a pole in the manner\r\nrepresented, fig. 45, p. 226.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 51._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 6.--THE ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThis telescope constitutes the most important and useful improvement\r\never made upon telescopic instruments; and, it is probable, it will,\r\nere long, supersede the use of all other telescopes. Its importance and\r\nutility will at once appear when we consider, that a good achromatic\r\ntelescope of only 4 or 5 feet in length will bear a magnifying power\r\nas great, as that of a common astronomical telescope 100 feet long,\r\nand even with a greater degree of distinctness, so that they are now\r\ncome into general use both for terrestrial and celestial observations.\r\nThere are, indeed, certain obstructions which prevent their being made\r\nof a very large size; but from the improvement in the manufacture\r\nof achromatic glass which is now going forward, it is to be hoped\r\nthat the difficulties which have hitherto impeded the progress of\r\nopticians will soon be removed. In order to understand the nature\r\nof this telescope, it will be necessary to advert a little to the\r\n_imperfections_ connected with common refracting telescopes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 52._]\r\n\r\nThe first imperfection to which I allude is this, that _spherical\r\nsurfaces do not refract the rays of light accurately to a point_;\r\nand hence the image formed by a single convex lens is not perfectly\r\naccurate and distinct. The rays which pass near the extremities of such\r\na lens meet in foci nearer to the lens than those which pass nearly\r\nthrough the centre, which may be illustrated by the following figure.\r\nLet PP (fig. 52) be a convex lens and E_e_ an object, the point E of\r\nwhich corresponds with the axis, and sends forth the rays EM, EN, EA,\r\n&c., all of which reach the surface of the glass, but in different\r\nparts. It is manifest that the ray EA which passes through the middle\r\nof the glass, suffers no refraction. The rays EM, EM, likewise, which\r\npass through near to EA, will be converged to a focus at F, which we\r\ngenerally consider as the focus of the lens. But the rays EN, EN, which\r\nare nearer to the edge of the glass will be differently refracted, and\r\nwill meet about G, nearer to the lens, where they will form another\r\nimage G_g_. Hence, it is evident, that the first image F_f_, is formed\r\nonly by the union of those rays which pass very near the centre of the\r\nlens; but as the rays of light proceeding from every point of an object\r\nare very numerous, there is a succession of images formed, according\r\nto the parts of the lens where they penetrate, which necessarily\r\nproduces indistinctness and confusion. This is the imperfection which\r\nis distinguished by the name of _spherical aberration_, or the error\r\narising from the spherical form of lenses.\r\n\r\nThe second and most important imperfection of single lenses, when used\r\nfor the object-glasses of telescopes, is, that the rays of compounded\r\nlight being differently refrangible, come to their respective foci at\r\ndifferent distances from the glass; the more refrangible rays, as the\r\n_violet_, converging sooner than those which are less refrangible, as\r\nthe _red_. I have had occasion to illustrate this circumstance, when\r\ntreating on the colours produced by the prism, (see p. 128, and figures\r\n32 and 33,) and it is confirmed by the experiment of a paper painted\r\nred, throwing its image, by means of a lens, at a greater distance\r\nthan another paper painted blue. From such facts and experiments, it\r\nappears, that the image of a white object consists of an indefinite\r\nnumber of coloured images, the violet being nearest, and the red\r\nfarthest from the lens, and the images of intermediate colours at\r\nintermediate distances. The aggregate, or image itself, must therefore\r\nbe in some degree confused; and this confusion being much increased\r\nby the magnifying power, it is found necessary to use an eye glass of\r\na certain limited convexity to a given object glass. Thus, an object\r\nglass of 34 inches focal length will bear an eye-glass of only 1 inch\r\nfocus, and will magnify the diameters of objects 34 times; one of 50\r\nfeet focal distance will require an eye-glass of 4-1/2 inches focus,\r\nand will magnify only 142 times; whereas, could we apply to it an\r\neye-glass of only 1 inch focus, as in the former case, it would magnify\r\nno less than 600 times. And were we to construct an object-glass of 100\r\nfeet focal length, we should require to apply an eye-glass, not less\r\nthan 6 inches focus, which would produce a power of about 200 times;\r\nso that there is no possibility of producing a great power by single\r\nlenses, without extending the telescope to an immoderate length.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton, after having made his discoveries respecting the\r\ncolours of light, considered the circumstance we have now stated as\r\nan insuperable barrier to the improvement of refracting telescopes;\r\nand therefore turned his attention to the improvement of telescopes\r\nby _reflection_. In the telescopes which he constructed and partly\r\ninvented, the images of objects are formed by reflection from speculums\r\nor mirrors; and being free from the irregular convergency of the\r\nvarious coloured rays of light, will admit of a much larger aperture\r\nand the application of a much greater degree of magnifying power. The\r\nreflector which Newton constructed was only 6 inches long, but it was\r\ncapable of bearing a power equal to that of a 6 feet refractor. It was\r\na long time, however, after the invention of these telescopes before\r\nthey were made of a size fitted for making celestial observations.\r\nAfter reflecting telescopes had been some time in use, Dollond made his\r\nfamous discovery of the principle which led him to the construction\r\nof the _achromatic_ telescope. This invention consists of a compound\r\nobject glass formed of two different kinds of glass, by which both\r\nthe spherical aberration and the errors arising from the different\r\nrefrangibility of the rays of light are, in a great measure corrected.\r\nFor the explanation of the nature of this compound object glass and of\r\nthe effects it produces; it may be expedient to offer the following\r\nremarks respecting the dispersion of light and its refraction by\r\ndifferent substances.\r\n\r\nThe _dispersion_ of light is estimated by the variable angle formed by\r\nthe red and violet rays which bound the solar spectrum;--or rather,\r\nit is the excess of the refraction of the most refrangible ray above\r\nthat of the least refrangible ray. The dispersion is not proportional\r\nto the refraction--that is, the substances which have an equal mean\r\nrefraction, do not _disperse_ light in the same ratio. For example,\r\nif we make a prism with plates of glass, and fill it with oil of\r\nCassia, and adjust its refracting angle ACB, (fig. 31, p. 127,) so\r\nthat the middle of the spectrum which it forms falls exactly at the\r\nsame place where the green rays of a spectrum formed by a glass prism\r\nwould fall--then we shall find that the spectrum formed by the _oil\r\nof Cassia_ prism will be two or three times _longer_ than that of the\r\n_glass_ prism. The oil of Cassia, therefore, is said to _disperse_ the\r\nrays of light more than the glass, that is, to separate the extreme\r\nred and violet rays at O and P more than the mean ray at _green_, and\r\nto have a greater _dispersive power_. Sir I. Newton appears to have\r\nmade use of prisms composed of different substances, yet, strange to\r\ntell, he never observed that they formed spectrums, whose lengths were\r\ndifferent, when the refraction of the green ray was the same; but\r\nthought that the dispersion was proportional to the refraction. This\r\nerror continued to be overlooked by philosophers for a considerable\r\ntime, and was the cause of retarding the invention of the achromatic\r\ntelescope for more than 50 years.\r\n\r\nDollond was among the first who detected this error. By his experiments\r\nit appears, that the different kinds of glass differ extremely with\r\nrespect to the divergency of colours produced by equal refractions.\r\nHe found that two prisms, one of white flint glass, whose refracting\r\nangle was about 25 degrees, and another of crown glass whose refracting\r\nangle was about 29 degrees, refracted the beam of light nearly alike;\r\nbut that the divergency of colour in the white flint was considerably\r\nmore than in the crown glass; so that when they were applied together,\r\nto refract contrary ways, and a beam of light transmitted through\r\nthem, though the emergent continued parallel to the incident part,\r\nit was, notwithstanding, separated into component colours. From this\r\nhe inferred, that, in order to render the emergent beam white, it is\r\nnecessary that the refracting angle of the prism of crown glass should\r\nbe _increased_, and by repeated experiments he discovered the exact\r\nquantity. By these means he obtained a theory in which refraction was\r\nperformed without any separation or divergency of colour; and thus the\r\nway was prepared for applying the principle he had ascertained to the\r\nconstruction of the object glasses of refracting telescopes. For the\r\nedges of a convex and concave lens, when placed in contact with each\r\nother, may be considered as two prisms which refract contrary ways;\r\nand if the excess of refraction in the one be such as precisely to\r\ndestroy the divergency of colour in the other, a colourless image will\r\nbe formed. Thus, if two lenses are made of the same focal length, the\r\none of flint glass and the other of crown, the length or diameter of\r\nthe coloured image in the first will be to that produced by the crown\r\nglass, as 3 to 2 nearly. Now, if we make the focal lengths of the\r\nlenses in this proportion, that is, as 3 to 2, the coloured spectrum\r\nproduced by each will be equal. But if the flint lens be concave, and\r\nthe crown convex--when placed in contact--they will mutually correct\r\neach other, and a pencil of white light refracted by the compound lens\r\nwill remain colourless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 53._]\r\n\r\nThe following figure may perhaps illustrate what has been now stated.\r\nLet LL (fig. 53.) represent a convex lens of _crown glass_, and _ll_\r\na concave lens of _flint glass_. A ray of the sun S, falls at F on\r\nthe convex lens which will refract it exactly as the prism ABC, whose\r\nfaces touch the two surfaces of the lens at the points where the ray\r\nenters and quits it. The solar ray, SF, thus refracted by the lens LL,\r\nor prism ABC, would have formed a spectrum PT on the wall, had there\r\nbeen no other lens, the violet ray F crossing the axis of the lens\r\nat V, and going to the upper end P of the spectrum; and the red ray\r\nFR, going to the lower end T. But as the flint-glass lens _ll_, or the\r\nprism A_a_C which receives the rays FV, FR, at the same points, is\r\ninterposed, these rays will be united at _f_, and form a small circle\r\nof white light; the ray SF of the sun being now refracted without\r\ncolour from its primitive direction SFY into the new direction F_f_.\r\nIn like manner the corresponding ray SM will be refracted to _f_,\r\nand a white and colourless image of the sun will be there formed by\r\nthe two lenses. In this combination of lenses it is obvious that the\r\nspherical aberration of the flint lens corrects to a considerable\r\ndegree that of the crown-glass, and by a proper adjustment of the radii\r\nof the surfaces, it may be almost wholly removed. This error is still\r\nmore completely corrected in the _triple_ achromatic object-glass,\r\nwhich consists of three lenses--a concave flint lens placed between\r\nconvexes of crown glass. Fig. 54 shows the _double_ achromatic lens,\r\nand fig. 55, the _triple_ object-glass, as they are fitted up in their\r\ncells, and placed at the object end of the telescope. In consequence\r\nof their producing a focal image free of colour they will bear a\r\nmuch larger aperture and a much greater magnifying power than common\r\nrefracting telescopes of the same length. While a common telescope\r\nwhose object-glass is 3-1/2 feet focal distance will bear an aperture\r\nof scarcely 1 inch, the 3-1/2 feet Achromatic will bear an aperture\r\nof 3-1/4 inches, and consequently transmits 10-1/2 times the quantity\r\nof light. While the one can bear a magnifying power of only about 36\r\ntimes, the other will bear a magnifying power for celestial objects of\r\nmore than 200 times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 54._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 55._]\r\n\r\nThe theory of the achromatic telescope is somewhat complicated and\r\nabstruse, and would require a more lengthened investigation than my\r\nlimits will permit. But what has been already stated may serve to\r\ngive the reader a general idea of the _principle_ on which it is\r\nconstructed, which is all I intended. The term _achromatic_ by which\r\nsuch instruments are now distinguished was first given to them by Dr.\r\nBevis. It is compounded of two Greek words which signify, ‘free of\r\ncolour.’ And, were it not that even philosophers are not altogether\r\nfree of that pedantry which induces us to select Greek words which\r\nare unintelligible to the mass of mankind, they might have been\r\ncontented with selecting the plain English word _colourless_, which\r\nis as significant and expressive as the Greek word _achromatic_. The\r\n_crown-glass_, of which the convex lenses of this telescope are made,\r\nis the same as good common window-glass; and the _flint-glass_ is that\r\nspecies of glass of which wine-glasses, tumblers, decanters and similar\r\narticles are formed, and is sometimes distinguished by the name of\r\ncrystal-glass. Some opticians have occasionally formed the concave\r\nlens of an achromatic object-glass from the bottom of a broken tumbler.\r\n\r\nThis telescope was invented and constructed by Mr. John Dollond, about\r\nthe year 1758. When he began his researches into this subject, he was\r\na silk weaver in Spitalfields, London. The attempt of the celebrated\r\nEuler to form a colourless telescope, by including water between two\r\nmeniscus glasses, attracted his attention, and, in the year 1753, he\r\naddressed a letter to Mr. Short, the optician, which was published in\r\nthe Philosophical Transactions of London, ‘concerning a mistake in\r\nEuler’s theorem for correcting the aberrations in the object glasses\r\nof refracting telescopes.’ After a great variety of experiments on\r\nthe refractive and dispersive powers of different substances, he\r\nat last constructed a telescope in which an exact balance of the\r\nopposite dispersive powers of the crown and flint lenses made the\r\ncolours disappear, while the predominating refraction of the crown\r\nlens disposed the achromatic rays to meet at a distant focus. In\r\nconstructing such object glasses, however, he had several difficulties\r\nto encounter. In the first place, the focal distance as well as the\r\nparticular surfaces must be very nicely proportioned to the densities\r\nor refractive powers of the glasses, which are very apt to vary in the\r\nsame sort of glass made at different times. In the next place, the\r\ncenters of the two glasses must be placed truly in the common axis of\r\nthe telescope, otherwise the desired effect will be in a great measure\r\ndestroyed. To these difficulties is to be added--that there are four\r\nsurfaces (even in double achromatic object glasses) to be wrought\r\nperfectly spherical; and every person practised in optical operations\r\nwill allow, that there must be the greatest accuracy throughout the\r\nwhole work. But these and other difficulties were at length overcome by\r\nthe judgment and perseverance of this ingenious artist.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that Dollond was not the only person who had\r\nthe merit of making this discovery--a private gentleman, Mr. Chest,\r\nof Chest-hall, a considerable number of years before, having made a\r\nsimilar discovery, and applied it to the same purpose. This fact was\r\nascertained in the course of a process raised against Dollond at the\r\ninstance of Watkins, optician at Charing-cross, when applying for a\r\npatent. But as the other gentleman had kept his invention a secret,\r\nand Dollond had brought it forth for the benefit of the public, the\r\ndecision was given in his favour. There was no evidence that Dollond\r\nborrowed the idea from his competitor, and both were, to a certain\r\nextent, entitled to the merits of the invention.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest obstructions to the construction of large\r\nachromatic telescopes is, the difficulty of procuring large discs of\r\nflint glass of an uniform refractive density--of good colour, and free\r\nfrom veins. It is said that, fortunately for Mr. Dollond, this kind\r\nof glass was procurable when he began to make achromatic telescopes,\r\nthough the attempts of ingenious chemists have since been exerted to\r\nmake it without much success. It is also said, that the glass employed\r\nby Dollond in the fabrication of his best telescopes, was of the same\r\nmelting, or made at the same time, and that, excepting this particular\r\ntreasure, casually obtained, good dense glass for achromatic purposes,\r\nwas always as difficult to be procured as it is now. The dispersion of\r\nthe flint glass, too, is so variable, that, in forming an achromatic\r\nlens, trials on each specimen require to be made before the absolute\r\nproportional dispersion of the substances can be ascertained. It is\r\nowing, in a great measure, to these circumstances, that a large and\r\ngood achromatic telescope cannot be procured unless at a very high\r\nprice. Mr. Tulley of Islington--who has been long distinguished as a\r\nmaker of excellent achromatic instruments--showed me, about six years\r\nago, a rude piece of flint glass about five inches diameter, intended\r\nfor the concave lens of an achromatic object glass, for which he paid\r\neight guineas. This was before the piece of glass was either figured\r\nor polished, and, consequently, he had still to perform the delicate\r\noperation of figuring, polishing, and adjusting this concave to the\r\nconvex lenses with which it was to be combined; and during the process\r\nsome veins or irregularities might be detected in the flint glass which\r\ndid not then appear. Some years before, he procured a disc of glass\r\nfrom the continent about seven or eight inches diameter, for which he\r\npaid about thirty guineas, with which an excellent telescope, twelve\r\nfeet focal length, was constructed for the Astronomical Society of\r\nLondon. It is obvious therefore, that large achromatic telescopes must\r\nbe charged at a pretty high price.\r\n\r\nIn order to stimulate ingenious chemists and opticians to make\r\nexperiments on this subject, the Board of Longitude, more than half\r\na century ago, offered a considerable reward for bringing the art\r\nof making good flint glass for optical purposes to the requisite\r\nperfection. But considerable difficulties arise in attempting\r\nimprovements of this kind; as the experiments must all be tried on a\r\nvery large scale, and are necessarily attended with a heavy expence.\r\nAnd although government has been extremely liberal in voting money for\r\nwarlike purposes, and in bestowing pensions on those who stood in no\r\nneed of them, it has hitherto thrown an obstruction in the way of such\r\nexperiments, by the heavy duty of excise, which is rigorously exacted,\r\nwhether the glass be manufactured into saleable articles or not; and\r\nhas thus been instrumental in retarding the progress of improvement\r\nand discovery. It would appear that experiments of this kind have\r\nbeen attended with more success in France, Germany, and other places\r\non the continent, than in Britain; as several very large achromatic\r\ntelescopes have been constructed in those countries by means of flint\r\nglass which was cast for the purpose in different manufactories, and\r\nto which British artists have been considerably indebted; as the\r\nLondon opticians frequently purchase their largest discs of flint\r\nglass from Parisian agents. Guinaud, a continental experimenter, and\r\nwho was originally a cabinet maker, appears to have had his labours\r\nin this department of art crowned with great success. Many years were\r\nemployed in his experiments, and he too frequently, notwithstanding all\r\nhis attention, discovered his metal to be vitiated by striæ, spects\r\nor grains, with cometic tails. He constructed a furnace capable of\r\nmelting two _cwt_ of glass in one mass, which he sawed vertically,\r\nand polished one of the sections, in order to observe what had taken\r\nplace during the fusion. From time to time, as he obtained blocks,\r\nincluding portions of good glass, his practice was to separate them by\r\nsawing the blocks into horizontal sections, or perpendicular to their\r\naxes. A fortunate accident conducted him to a better process. While\r\nhis men were one day carrying a block of this glass, on a hand-barrow,\r\nto a saw mill which he had erected at the Fall of the Doubs, the\r\nmass slipped from its bearers, and, rolling to the bottom of a steep\r\nand rocky declivity, was broken to pieces. Guinaud having selected\r\nthose fragments which appeared perfectly homogeneous, softened them\r\nin circular moulds, in such a manner, that on cooling, he obtained\r\ndiscs that were afterwards fit for working. To this method he adhered,\r\nand contrived a way for clearing his glass while cooling, so that the\r\nfractures should follow the most faulty parts. When flaws occurred in\r\nthe large masses, they were removed by cleaving the pieces with wedges;\r\nthen smelting them again in moulds, which give them the form of discs.\r\nThe Astronomical Society of London have made trial of discs made by\r\nGuinaud, and have found them entirely homogeneous and free from fault.\r\nOf this ingenious artist’s flint glass, some of the largest achromatic\r\ntelescopes on the continent have been constructed. But, it is more\r\nthan twenty years since this experimenter took his flight from this\r\nterrestrial scene, and it is uncertain whether his process be still\r\ncarried on with equal success.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Notices of some large Achromatic telescopes on the Continent and in\r\nGreat Britain._\r\n\r\n1. _The Dorpat Telescope._--This is one of the largest and most\r\nexpensive Refracting telescopes ever constructed. It was made by\r\nthe celebrated Fraunhofer of Munich for the observatory of the\r\nImperial University of Dorpat, and was received into the observatory\r\nby Professor Struve in the year 1825. The aperture of the object\r\nglass of this telescope is 9-1/2 English inches, and its solar focal\r\nlength about fourteen feet, the main tube being thirteen French feet\r\nexclusive of the tube which holds the eye pieces. The smallest of the\r\nfour magnifying powers it possesses, is 175, and the largest 700,\r\nwhich, in favourable weather, is said to present the object with the\r\nutmost precision. ‘This instrument,’ says Struve, ‘was sold to us by\r\nPrivy-Counsellor VON UTZCHNEIDER, the chief of the optical\r\nestablishment at Munich, for 10,500 florins, (about £950 sterling), a\r\nprice which only covers the expenses which the establishment incurred\r\nin making it.’ The frame work of the stand of this telescope is of oak\r\ninlaid with pieces of mahogany in an ornamental manner, and the tube is\r\nof deal veneered with mahogany and highly polished. The whole weight\r\nof the telescope and its counterpoises is supported at one point, at\r\nthe common center of gravity of all its parts; and though these weigh\r\n3000 Russian pounds, yet, we are told that this enormous telescope may\r\nbe turned in every direction towards the heavens with more ease and\r\ncertainty than any other hitherto in use. When the object end of the\r\ntelescope is elevated to the zenith, it is sixteen feet four inches,\r\nParis measure, above the floor, and its eye end in this position is\r\ntwo feet nine inches high. This instrument is mounted on an Equatorial\r\nstand, and clock work is applied to the Equatorial axis, which gives it\r\na smooth and regular sidereal motion, which, it is said, keeps a star\r\nin the exact center of the field of view, and produces the appearance\r\nof a state of rest in the starry regions, which motion can be made\r\nsolar, or even lunar, by a little change given to the place of a\r\npointer, that is placed as an index on the dial plate. Professor Struve\r\nconsiders the optical powers of this telescope superior to those of\r\nSchröeter’s twenty-five feet reflector, from having observed σ Orionis\r\nwith fifteen companions, though Schröeter observed only twelve, that\r\nhe could count with certainty. Nay, he seems disposed to place it in\r\ncompetition with the late Sir W. Herschel’s forty feet reflector. The\r\n_finder_ of this telescope has a focal distance of 30 French inches,\r\nand 2-42 aperture.\r\n\r\n2. _Sir James South’s Telescope._--About the year 1829, Sir J.\r\nSouth, President of the London Astronomical Society, procured of M.\r\nCauchoix of Paris, an achromatic object glass of 11-2/10 inches, clear\r\naperture, and of 19 feet focal length. The flint glass employed in its\r\nconstruction was the manufacture of the late Guinaud le Pere, and was\r\nfound to be absolutely perfect. The first observation was made with\r\nthis telescope, while on a temporary stand, on Feb. 13, 1830, when Sir\r\nJ. Herschel discovered with it a _sixth_ star in the trapezium in the\r\nnebula of Orion, whose brightness was about one third of that of the\r\nfifth star discovered by Struve, which is as distinctly seen as the\r\ncompanion to Polaris is in a five feet achromatic. Sir James gives the\r\nfollowing notices of the performance of this instrument on the morning\r\nof May 14, 1830. ‘At half past two, placed the 20 feet achromatic on\r\nthe Georgium Sidus, saw it with a power of 346, a beautiful planetary\r\ndisc; not the slightest suspicion of any ring, either perpendicular or\r\nhorizontal; but the planet three hours east of the meridian, and the\r\nmoon within three degrees of the planet.’ At a quarter before three,\r\nviewed _Jupiter_ with 252 and 346, literally covered with belts, and\r\nthe diameters of his satellites might have been as easily measured\r\nas himself. One came from behind the body, and the contrast of the\r\ncolour with that of the planet’s limb was striking. At three o’clock\r\nviewed _Mars_. The contrast of light in the vicinity of the poles very\r\ndecided. Several spots on his body well and strongly marked--that about\r\nthe south pole seems to overtake the body of the planet, and gives an\r\nappearance not unlike that afforded by the new moon, familiarly known\r\nas ‘the old moon in the new moon’s arms.’ _Saturn_ has been repeatedly\r\nseen with powers from 130 to 928 under circumstances the most\r\nfavourable; but not any thing anomalous about the planet or its ring\r\ncould even be suspected. This telescope is erected on an Equatorial\r\nstand at Sir J. South’s observatory, Kensington.\r\n\r\n3. _Captain Smyth’s Telescope in his private observatory at\r\nBedford._--This Achromatic telescope is 8-1/2 feet focal length, with a\r\nclear aperture of 5-9/10 inches worked by the late Mr. Tulley, Senior,\r\nfrom a disk purchased by Sir James South at Paris. It is considered\r\nby Captain Smyth to be the finest specimen of that eminent optician’s\r\nskill, and, it is said, will bear with distinctness, a magnifying\r\npower of 1200. Its distinctness has been proved by the clear vision\r\nit gives of the obscure nebulæ, and of the companions of Polaris,\r\nRigel, α Lyræ, and the most minute double stars---the lunar mountains,\r\ncavities and shadows under all powers--the lucid polar regions of\r\nMars--the sharpness of the double ring of Saturn--the gibbous aspect\r\nof Venus--the shadows of Jupiter’s satellites across his body, and\r\nthe splendid contrast of colours in α Hercules, γ Andromedæ and other\r\nsuperb double stars.\r\n\r\n_Other large Achromatics._--Besides the above, the following, belonging\r\nto public observatories and private individuals, may be mentioned. In\r\nthe Royal observatory at Greenwich, there is an Achromatic of 10 feet\r\nfocal distance, having a double object glass 5 inches diameter, which\r\nwas made by Mr. Peter Dollond, and the only one of that size he ever\r\nconstructed. There is also a 46 inch achromatic, with a triple object\r\nglass 3-3/4 inches aperture, which is said to be the most perfect\r\ninstrument of the kind ever produced. It was the favourite instrument\r\nof Dr. Maskelyne, late Astronomer Royal, who had a small room fitted\r\nup in the observatory for this telescope. The observatory, some years\r\nago erected near Cambridge, is perhaps the most splendid structure of\r\nthe kind in Great Britain. It is furnished with several very large\r\nachromatic telescopes on Equatorial machinery: but the Achromatic\r\ntelescope, lately presented to it by the Duke of Northumberland, is\r\nundoubtedly the largest instrument of this description which is to be\r\nfound in this country. The object glass is said to be 25 feet focal\r\ndistance, and of a corresponding diameter, but as there was no access\r\nto this instrument at the time I visited this observatory, nearly six\r\nyears ago, I am unable to give a particular description of it. In\r\nthe Royal Observatory at Paris, which I visited in 1837, I noticed,\r\namong other instruments, two very large Achromatic telescopes which,\r\nmeasuring them rudely by the eye--I estimated to be from 15 to 18\r\nfeet long, and the aperture at the object end, from 12 to 15 inches\r\ndiameter. They were the largest achromatics I had previously seen; but\r\nI could find no person in the observatory at that time, who could give\r\nme any information as to their history, or to their exact dimensions,\r\nor powers of magnifying.[21]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Pearson, Treasurer to the Astronomical Society of London,\r\nis in possession of the telescope formerly alluded to, made by Mr.\r\nTulley, of twelve feet focal distance and seven inches aperture, which\r\nis said to be a very fine one. The small star which accompanies the\r\npole star, with a power of a 100, appears through this telescope, as\r\ndistinct and steady as one of Jupiter’s satellites. With a single lens\r\nof 6 inches focus, which produced a power of 24 times, according to\r\nthe testimony of an observer who noticed it--the small star appeared\r\nas it does in an achromatic of 3 inches aperture, which shows the\r\ngreat effect of illuminating power in such instruments. Mr. Lawson, a\r\ndiligent astronomical observer in Hereford, possesses a most beautiful\r\nachromatic telescope of about 7 inches aperture, and 12 feet focal\r\ndistance, which was made by one of the Dollonds, who considered it\r\nas his _chief d’oeuvre_. It is said to bear powers as high as 1100\r\nor 1400; and has been fitted up with mechanism devised by Mr. Lawson\r\nhimself, so as to be perfectly easy and manageable to the observer,\r\nand which displays this gentleman’s inventive talent. In several of\r\nhis observations with this instrument, he is said to have had a view\r\nof some of the more minute subdivisions of the ring of Saturn. A very\r\nexcellent achromatic telescope was fitted up some years ago by my\r\nworthy friend William Bridges, Esq., Blackheath. Its object glass is\r\n5-1/2 inches diameter, and about 5-1/2 feet focal length. It is erected\r\nupon Equatorial machinery, and placed in a circular observatory which\r\nmoves round with a slight touch of the hand. The object glass of this\r\ninstrument cost about 200 Guineas, the equatorial machinery on which it\r\nis mounted cost 150 Guineas, and the circular observatory in which it\r\nis placed about 100 Guineas; in all 450 Guineas. Its powers vary from\r\n50 to 300 times.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Achromatic telescopes of a moderate size._\r\n\r\nSuch telescopes as I have alluded to above, are among the largest which\r\nhave yet been made on the achromatic principle; they are, of course,\r\ncomparatively rare, and can be afforded only at a very high price. Few\r\nof the _object glasses_ in the telescopes to which I have referred,\r\nwould be valued at less than 200 Guineas, independently of the tubes,\r\neye pieces and other apparatus with which they are fitted up. It is so\r\ndifficult to procure large discs of flint glass for optical purposes,\r\nto produce the requisite curves of the different lenses, and to combine\r\nthem together with that extreme accuracy which is requisite, that when\r\na good compound lens of this description is found perfectly achromatic,\r\nthe optician must necessarily set a high value upon it; since it may\r\nhappen that he may have finished half a dozen before he has got one\r\nthat is nearly perfect. The more common sizes of achromatic telescopes\r\nfor astronomical purposes, which are regularly sold by the London\r\nopticians, are the following:--\r\n\r\n1. _The 2-1/2 feet Achromatic._--This telescope has an object glass 30\r\ninches in focal length, and 2 inches clear aperture. It is generally\r\nfurnished with two eye pieces, one for terrestrial objects, magnifying\r\nabout 30 or 35 times, and one for celestial objects with a power of 70\r\nor 75 times. It might be furnished with an additional astronomical\r\neye-piece--if the object glass be a good one, so as to produce a power\r\nof 90 or 95 times. With such a telescope, the belts and satellites of\r\nJupiter, the phases of Venus and the ring of Saturn may be perceived;\r\nbut not to so much advantage as with larger telescopes. It is generally\r\nfitted up either with a mahogany or a brass tube, and is placed upon a\r\ntripod brass stand, with a universal joint which produces a horizontal\r\nand vertical motion. It is packed, along with the eye-pieces, and\r\nwhatever else belongs to it, in a neat mahogany box. Its price varies,\r\naccording as it is furnished with an elevating rack or other apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe following are the prices of this instrument as marked in the\r\ncatalogue of Mr. Tulley, Terrett’s Court, Islington, London.\r\n\r\n                                                                £  s. d.\r\n  2-1/2 feet telescopes, brass mounted on plain pillar and claw\r\n  stand, with one eye piece for astronomical purposes, and\r\n  one for land objects, to vary the magnifying power,\r\n  packed in a mahogany box                                       10 10 0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, ditto, brass mounted on pillar and claw stand, with\r\n  elevating rack, 1 eye piece for astronomical purposes, and\r\n  1 for land objects, to vary the magnifying power, packed\r\n  in a mahogany box                                              12 12 0\r\n\r\nThe following prices of the same kind of telescope are from the\r\ncatalogue of Messrs. W. and, S. Jones, 30, Lower Holborn, London.\r\n\r\n                                                                £  s. d.\r\n  The improved 2-1/2 feet achromatic refractor, on a brass\r\n  stand, mahogany tube, with three eye pieces, two magnifying\r\n  about 40 and 50 times for terrestrial objects, and the\r\n  other about 75 times for astronomical purposes, in a\r\n  mahogany case                                                  10 10 0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, ditto, the tube all brass, with three eye pieces        11 11 0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, ditto, with vertical and horizontal rack work\r\n  motions                                                        15 15 0\r\n\r\n2. _The 3-1/2 feet Achromatic Telescope._--The object glass of this\r\ntelescope is from 44 to 46 inches focal length, and 2-3/4 inches\r\ndiameter. It is generally furnished with four eye-pieces, two for\r\nterrestrial and two for celestial objects. The lowest power for land\r\nobjects is generally about 45, which affords a large field of view, and\r\nexhibits the objects with great brilliance. The other terrestrial power\r\nis usually from 65 to 70. The astronomical powers are about 80 and 130;\r\nbut such a telescope should always have another eye-piece, to produce\r\na power of 180 or 200 times, which it will bear with distinctness,\r\nin a serene state of the atmosphere, if the object glass be truly\r\nachromatic. The _illuminating power_ in this telescope is nearly double\r\nthat of the 2-1/2 feet telescope, or in the proportion of 7, 56 to\r\n4; and therefore it will bear about double the magnifying power with\r\nnearly equal distinctness. This telescope is fitted up in a manner\r\nsomewhat similar to the former, with a tripod stand which is placed\r\nupon a table. Sometimes, however, it is mounted on a long mahogany\r\nstand which rests upon the floor, (as in fig. 58.), and is fitted with\r\nan equatorial motion; and has generally a small telescope fixed near\r\nthe eye end of the large tube, called a _finder_, which serves to\r\ndirect the telescope to a particular object in the heavens when the\r\nhigher powers are applied. It is likewise eligible that it should have\r\nan elevating rack and sliding tubes, for supporting the eye end of the\r\ninstrument, to keep it steady during astronomical observations, and it\r\nwould be an advantage, for various purposes which shall be afterwards\r\ndescribed, to have fitted to it a _Diagonal Eye Piece_ magnifying 40\r\ntimes or upwards.\r\n\r\nThe prices of this instrument, as marked in Mr. Tulley’s Catalogue, are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n                                                                £  s. d.\r\n  The 3-1/2 feet achromatic telescope 2-3/4 inches aperture, on\r\n  plain pillar and claw stand, 2 eye pieces for astronomical\r\n  purposes, and 1 for land objects to vary the magnifying\r\n  power, packed in a mahogany box                               21  0  0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, ditto, with elevating rack and achromatic finder,\r\n  2 eye pieces for astronomical purposes, and 1 for day objects\r\n  to vary the magnifying power, packed in a mahogany\r\n  box                                                           26  5  0\r\n\r\nThe following are the prices as marked in Messrs. W. and S. Jones’\r\nCatalogue.\r\n\r\n                                                                £   s.  d.\r\n  The 3-1/2 feet achromatic, plain mahogany tube                 18  18  0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, ditto, brass tube                                       21   0  0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, all in brass, with rack work motions, &c.               26   5  0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, the object glass of the largest aperture, and the\r\n  rack motions on an improved principle      _from_ 37l. 16s. to 42   0  0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, fitted up with Equatorial motion, framed mahogany\r\n  stand, divided altitude, and azimuth arches, or declination\r\n  and right ascension circles, &c. &c.             _from_ 60l to 80   0  0\r\n\r\nThis is the telescope which I would particularly recommend to\r\nastronomical amateurs, whose pecuniary resources do not permit them\r\nto purchase more expensive instruments. When fitted up with the eye\r\npieces and powers already mentioned, and with a finder and elevating\r\nrack,--price 25 guineas--it will serve all the purposes of general\r\nobservation. By this telescope, satisfactory views may be obtained of\r\nmost of the interesting phenomena of the heavens, such as the spots of\r\nthe sun--the mountains, vales, and caverns on the lunar surface--the\r\nphases of Mercury and Venus--the spots on Mars--the satellites and\r\nbelts of Jupiter--the ring of Saturn--many of the more interesting\r\nnebulæ, and most of the double stars of the second and third classes.\r\nWhen the object glass of this telescope is accurately figured and\r\nperfectly achromatic, a power of from 200 to 230 maybe put upon it, by\r\nwhich the division of Saturn’s ring might occasionally be perceived. It\r\nis more easily managed and represents objects considerably brighter\r\nthan reflecting telescopes of the same price and magnifying power,\r\nand it is not so apt to be deranged as reflectors generally are. A\r\ntelescope of a less size would not in general be found satisfactory for\r\nviewing the objects I have now specified, and for general astronomical\r\npurposes. It may not be improper for the information of some readers,\r\nto explain what is meant in Mr. Tulley’s catalogue, when it is stated\r\nthat this instrument has ‘one eye piece for day objects, _to vary the\r\nmagnifying power_.’ The eye piece alluded to is so constructed, that\r\nby drawing out a tube next the eye, you may increase the power at\r\npleasure, and make it to vary, say from 40 to 80 or 100 times; so that\r\nsuch a construction of the terrestrial eye piece (to be afterwards\r\nexplained) serves in a great measure, the purpose of separate\r\neye-pieces. The whole length of the 3-1/2 feet telescope, when the\r\nterrestrial eye piece is applied, is about 4-1/2 feet from the object\r\nglass to the first eye glass.\r\n\r\nWhen the aperture of the object glass of this telescope exceeds 2-3/4\r\ninches its price rapidly advances.\r\n\r\nThe following is Mr. Tulley’s scale of prices, proportionate to the\r\nincrease of aperture:--\r\n\r\n                                                                  £  s. d.\r\n  3-1/2 feet telescopes 3-1/4 inches aperture, with vertical and\r\n  horizontal rack work motions, achromatic finder, 3 eye\r\n  pieces for astronomical purposes, and one for day objects\r\n  to vary the magnifying power, packed in a mahogany box         42  0  0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, ditto, 3-3/4 inches diameter, mounted as above          68  5  0\r\n\r\n  Ditto, with universal Equatorial, instead of pillar and\r\n  claw stand                                                     84  0  0\r\n\r\nHere, in the one case, the increase of half an inch in the diameter\r\nof the object-glass, adds about £16. to the expense; and in the\r\nother case no less than £26. 5s. The proportion of light in those\r\ntwo telescopes, compared with that of 2-3/4 inches aperture, is as\r\nfollows:--The square of the 2-3/4 object-glass is 7.56; that of 3-1/4,\r\n10.56, and that of the 3-3/4, 14.06; so that the light admitted by\r\nthe 3-1/4 compared with the 2-3/4 aperture, is nearly as 10 to 7; and\r\nthe light admitted by the 3-3/4 object-glass is nearly double that of\r\nthe 2-3/4 aperture, and will bear nearly a proportional increase of\r\nmagnifying power.\r\n\r\n3. _The 5 feet Achromatic telescope._ The focal length of the\r\nobject-glass of this telescope is 5 feet 3 inches, and the diameter\r\nof its aperture 3-8/10 inches. The usual magnifying powers applied\r\nto it are, for land objects 65 times; and for celestial objects,\r\n110, 190, 250, and sometimes one or two higher powers. The quantity\r\nof light it possesses is not much larger than that of the 3-1/2 feet\r\ntelescope, with 3-3/4 inches aperture; but the larger focal length of\r\nthis telescope is considered to be an advantage; since the longer the\r\nfocus of the object-glass, the less will be its chromatic and spherical\r\naberrations, and the larger may be the eye-glasses, and the flatter the\r\nfield of view.\r\n\r\nThe following are the prices of these telescopes as marked in Mr.\r\nTulley’s catalogue.\r\n\r\n                                                               £   s. d.\r\n  5 feet telescopes 3-3/4 inches aperture, on an universal\r\n  equatorial stand, with achromatic finder, 4 eye pieces for\r\n  astronomical purposes, and 1 for day objects to vary the\r\n  power, packed in a mahogany box               100 guineas to 157 10  0\r\n\r\n  7 feet ditto, 5 inches aperture, on a newly improved\r\n  universal equatorial stand, 6 eye pieces for astronomical\r\n  purposes, and 1 for day objects to vary the magnifying\r\n  power, with achromatic finder, and Troughton’s Micrometer     207 5  0\r\n\r\nThe above are all the kinds of achromatic telescopes _generally_\r\nmade by the London opticians. Those of the larger kind, as 5 and 7\r\nfeet telescopes, and the 3-1/2 feet with 3-3/4 inches aperture,\r\nare generally made to order, and are not always to be procured. But\r\nthe 2-1/2 and 3-1/2 feet achromatics of 2-3/4 inches aperture, are\r\ngenerally to be found ready-made at most of the optician’s shops in the\r\nmetropolis. The prices of these instruments are nearly the same in most\r\nof the optician’s shops in London. Some of them demand a higher price,\r\nbut few of them are ever sold lower than what has been stated above,\r\nunless in certain cases, where a discount is allowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 57._]\r\n\r\nThe stands for these telescopes, and the manner in which they are\r\nfitted up for observation are represented in figures 57, 58, and 59.\r\nFig. 57 represents either the 2-1/2 or the 3-1/2 feet telescopes\r\nmounted on a plain brass stand, to be placed on a table. A is the long\r\neye-piece for land objects, and B the small eye-piece for astronomical\r\nobservation, which is composed of two lenses, and represents the object\r\nin an inverted position. These eye-pieces are screwed on, as occasion\r\nrequires, at E, the eye-end of the telescope. The shorter of the two\r\nastronomical eye-tubes which accompany this telescope, produces the\r\nhighest magnifying power. For adjusting the telescope to distinct\r\nvision, there is a brass knob or button at _a_, which moves a piece of\r\nrack-work connected with the eye-tube, which must be turned either one\r\nway or the other till the object appears distinctly; and different eyes\r\nfrequently require a different adjustment.\r\n\r\nFig. 58, represents a 5 feet telescope fitted up for astronomical\r\nobservations. It is mounted on a mahogany stand, the three legs of\r\nwhich are made to close up together by means of the brass frame _aaa_,\r\nwhich is composed of three bars, connected with three joints in the\r\ncentre, and three other joints, connected with the three mahogany bars.\r\nIt is furnished with an apparatus for equatorial motions. The brass pin\r\nis made to move round in the brass socket _b_, and may be tightened by\r\nmeans of the finger screw _d_, when the telescope is directed nearly to\r\nthe object intended to be viewed. This socket may be set perpendicular\r\nto the horizon, or to any other required angle; and the quantity of\r\nthe angle is ascertained by the divided arc, and the instrument made\r\nfast in that position by the screw _e_. If this socket be set to the\r\nlatitude of the place of observation, and the plane of this arc be\r\nturned so as to be in the plane of the meridian, the socket _b_ being\r\nfixed to the inclination of the pole of the earth, the telescope\r\nwhen turned in this socket, will have an equatorial motion, so that\r\ncelestial objects may be always kept in view, when this equatorial\r\nmotion is performed. The two handles at _k_ are connected with\r\nrack-work, intended to move the telescope in any required direction.\r\nThe two sets of brass sliding rods _ii_ are intended to render the\r\ntelescope as steady as possible, and to elevate and depress it at\r\npleasure, and are so constructed as to slide into each other with the\r\nutmost ease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 58._]\r\n\r\nThe _Finder_ is placed at AE, either on the top or the left side of\r\nthe tube of the telescope. When high magnifying powers are applied to\r\nany telescope, it is sometimes difficult, on account of the smallness\r\nof the field of view, to direct the main tube of the telescope to the\r\nobject. But the Finder, which is a telescope with a small power, and\r\nconsequently has a large field of view--when directed to any object, it\r\nis easily found, and being brought to the centre of the field, where\r\ntwo cross hairs intersect each other, it will then be seen in the\r\nlarger telescope. B is the eye-tube for terrestrial objects, containing\r\n4 glasses, and C, one of the astronomical eye-pieces. A socket is\r\nrepresented at _g_, containing a stained glass, which is screwed to any\r\nof the eye-pieces, to protect the eye from the glare of light, when\r\nviewing the spots of the sun. The brass nut above _f_, is intended for\r\nthe adjustment of the eye-piece to distinct vision. The 3-1/2 feet\r\ntelescope is sometimes mounted in this form.\r\n\r\nFig. 59, represents a 5 or 6 feet telescope, mounted on a stand of a\r\nnew construction by Dollond. It possesses the advantage of supporting\r\nthe telescope in two places, which renders it extremely steady--a\r\nproperty of great importance when viewing celestial objects with high\r\nmagnifying powers. It possesses likewise, the advantage of enabling the\r\nobserver to continue seated at the same height from the floor, although\r\nthe telescope be raised to any altitude--_the elevation being entirely\r\nat the object end_, although it may be changed from the horizon to\r\nthe zenith. The frame-work is composed of bars of mahogany, and rests\r\non three castors, two of which are made fast to their respective legs\r\nin the usual way, and the third stands under the middle of the lower\r\nhorizontal bar that connects the two opposite legs, so that the frame\r\nhas all the advantages of a tripod. As it becomes very inconvenient to\r\nstoop to the eye end of a telescope, when the altitude of an object is\r\nconsiderable, and the centre of motion at the middle of the tube, this\r\nconstruction of a stand serves to remedy such inconvenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 59._]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Proportions of curvature of the lenses which form an achromatic\r\nobject-glass._\r\n\r\nAs some ingenious mechanics may feel a desire to attempt the\r\nconstruction of a compound achromatic object-glass, I shall here state\r\nsome of the proportions of curvature of the concave and convex lenses,\r\nwhich serve to guide opticians in their construction of achromatic\r\ninstruments. These proportions are various; and even when demonstrated\r\nto be mathematically correct, it is sometimes difficult to reduce them\r\nto practice, on account of the different powers of refraction and\r\ndispersion possessed by different discs of crown and flint-glass, and\r\nof the difficulty of producing by mechanical means, the exact curves\r\nwhich theory requires. The following table shows the radii of curvature\r\nof the different surfaces of the lenses necessary to form _a double\r\nachromatic object-glass_--it being supposed that the sine of refraction\r\nin the crown-glass is as 1.528 to 1, and in the flint as 1.5735 to 1;\r\nthe ratio of their dispersive powers being as 1 to 1.524. It is also\r\nassumed that the curvatures of the concave lens are as 1 to 2, that\r\nis, that the one side of this lens is ground on a tool, the radius\r\nof which is double that of the other. The 1st column expresses the\r\ncompound focus of the object-glass in _inches_; the 2nd column states\r\nthe radius of the _anterior_ surface of the _crown_, and column 3rd,\r\nits _posterior_ side. Column 4th expresses the radius of the anterior\r\nsurface of the _concave_ lens, and column 5th its posterior surface,\r\nwhich, it will be observed, is exactly double that of the other.\r\n\r\n  -------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  Focus  |Radius of  |Radius of  |Radius of  |Radius of\r\n  in     |anterior   |posterior  |anterior   |posterior\r\n  inches.|surface,   |surface.   |surface,   |surface.\r\n         |convex.    |           |concave.   |\r\n  -------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n         |Inc.

It may be proper to observe,\r\nthat in these computations, the radius of the anterior surface of the\r\nconcave is less than the posterior side of the convex, and consequently\r\nadmits of its approach, without touching in the centre--a circumstance\r\nwhich always requires to be guarded against in the combination of\r\nachromatic glasses.

The following are the curves of the lenses of one of\r\nthe best of Dollond’s achromatic telescopes, the focal length of the\r\ncompound object-glass being 46 inches. Reckoning from the surface next\r\nthe object--the radii of the crown-glass were 28 and 40 inches: the\r\nconcave lens 20.9 inches, and the inner crown-glass lens, 28.4 and 28.4\r\ninches. This telescope carried magnifying powers of from 100 to 200\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have inserted the above tables, which might in some measure\r\nguide an ingenious artist, yet on the whole, a private amateur has\r\nlittle chance in succeeding in such attempts. The diversity of glasses,\r\nand the uncertainty of an unpractised workman’s producing the precise\r\ncurvatures he intends, is so great, that the object-glass, for the\r\nmost part, turns out different from his expectations. The great\r\ndifficulty in the construction is to find the exact proportion of the\r\ndispersive powers of the crown and flint glass. The crown is pretty\r\nconstant, but there are hardly two pots of flint glass which have the\r\nsame dispersive power. Even if constant, it is difficult to measure\r\nit accurately; and an error in this greatly affects the instrument;\r\nbecause the focal distances of the lenses must be nearly as their\r\ndispersive powers. In the two preceding tables, the sine of incidence,\r\nin the crown glass, is supposed to be to the sine of refraction as\r\n1.526 to 1; and in the flint glass, as 1.604 to 1. Opticians who make\r\ngreat numbers of lenses both of flint and crown glass, acquire, in\r\ntime, a pretty good guess of the nature of the errors which may remain\r\nafter they have finished an object-glass; and having many lenses\r\nintended to be of the same form, but unavoidably differing a little\r\nfrom it, they try several of the concaves with the two convexes, and\r\nfinding one better than the rest, they make use of it to complete the\r\nset. In this way some of the best achromatic telescopes are frequently\r\nformed. I have sometimes found, when supplying a concave flint glass\r\nto a telescope where it happened to be wanting, that, of four or five\r\nconcave lenses which appeared to be the same as to curvature and other\r\nproperties, only one was found to produce a distinct and colourless\r\nimage. Should any one, however, wish to attempt the construction of\r\nan achromatic lens, the best way for preventing disappointments in\r\nthe result is, to procure a _variety_ of tables of the respective\r\ncurvatures founded on _different conditions_, and which, of course,\r\nrequire the surfaces of the several lenses to be of different curves.\r\nHaving lenses of different radii at his command, and having glass of\r\ndifferent refractive or dispersive powers, when one combination does\r\nnot exactly suit, he may try another, and ultimately may succeed in\r\nconstructing a good achromatic telescope; for, in many cases, it has\r\nbeen found that chance, or a happy combination of lenses by trial, has\r\nled to the formation of an excellent object-glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Achromatic telescopes composed of fluid lenses._\r\n\r\nThe best achromatic telescopes, when minutely examined, are found to be\r\nin some respects defective, on account of that slight degree of colour\r\nwhich, by the aberration of the rays, they give to objects, unless\r\nthe object-glass be of small diameter. When we examine with attention\r\na good achromatic telescope we find that it does not show white or\r\nluminous objects perfectly free from colour, their edges being tinged\r\non one side with a claret-coloured fringe, and on the other with a\r\ngreen fringe. This telescope, therefore, required farther improvement,\r\nto get rid of these secondary colours, and Father Boscovich, to whom\r\nevery branch of optics is much indebted, displayed much ingenuity in\r\nhis attempts to attain this object. But it is to Dr. Blair, professor\r\nof astronomy in Edinburgh, that we are chiefly indebted for the first\r\nsuccessful experiments by which this end was accomplished. By a\r\njudicious set of experiments, he proved that the quality of dispersing\r\nthe rays in a greater degree than crown-glass, is not confined to a few\r\nmediums; but is possessed by a great variety of fluids, and by some of\r\nthese in a most extraordinary degree. Having observed that when the\r\nextreme red and violet rays were perfectly united, the green were left\r\nout, he conceived the idea of making an achromatic concave lens which\r\nshould refract the green less than the united red and violet, and an\r\nachromatic convex lens which should do the same, and as the concave\r\nlens refracted the outstanding green _to_ the axis, while the concave\r\none refracted them _from_ the axis, it followed, that, by a combination\r\nof these two opposite effects, the green would be united with the red\r\nand violet.\r\n\r\nBy means of an ingenious prismatic apparatus, he examined the optical\r\nproperties of a great variety of fluids. The solutions of metals and\r\nsemi-metals proved in all cases more dispersive than crown glass. Some\r\nof the salts, such as sal-ammoniac, greatly increased the dispersive\r\npower of water. The marine acid disperses very considerably, and this\r\nquality increases with its strength. The most dispersive fluids were\r\naccordingly found to be those in which this acid and the metals were\r\ncombined. The chemical preparation called _causticum antimoniale_, or\r\nbutter of antimony, in its most concentrated state, when it has just\r\nattracted sufficient humidity to render it fluid, possesses the quality\r\nof dispersing the rays in an astonishing degree. The great quantity\r\nof the semi-metal retained in solution, and the highly concentrated\r\nstate of the marine acid, are considered as the cause of this striking\r\neffect. Corrosive sublimate of mercury, added to a solution of\r\n_sal-ammoniacum_ in water, possesses the next place to the butter of\r\nantimony among the dispersive fluids, which Dr. Blair examined. The\r\nessential oils were found to hold the next rank to metallic solutions,\r\namong fluids which possess the dispersive quality, particularly those\r\nobtained from bituminous minerals, as native petrolea, pit coal, and\r\namber. The dispersive power of the essential oil of sassafras, and\r\nthe essential oil of lemons, when genuine, were found to be not much\r\ninferior to any of these. But of all the fluids fitted for optical\r\npurposes, Dr. Blair found that _the muriatic acid mixed with a metallic\r\nsolution_, or, in other words, a fluid in which the marine acid and\r\nmetalline particles, hold a due proportion, most accurately suited his\r\npurpose. In a spectrum formed by this fluid the green were among the\r\nmost refrangible rays, and when its dispersion was corrected by that\r\nof glass, there was produced an inverted secondary spectrum, that is,\r\none in which the green was above, when it would have been below with a\r\ncommon medium. He therefore placed a concave lens of muriatic acid with\r\na metallic solution between the two lenses, as in fig. 60, where AB is\r\nthe concave fluid lens, CF a plano-convex lens, with its plane side\r\nnext the object, and ED, a meniscus. With this object-glass the rays of\r\ndifferent colours were bent from their rectilineal course with the same\r\nequality and regularity as in reflection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 60._]\r\n\r\nTelescopes constructed with such object-glasses were examined by the\r\nlate Dr. Robison and professor Playfair. The focal distance of the\r\nobject-glass of one of these did not exceed 17 inches, and yet it\r\nbore an aperture of 3-1/2 inches. They viewed some single and double\r\nstars and some common objects with this telescope; and found, that,\r\nin magnifying power, brightness, and distinctness, it was manifestly\r\nsuperior to one of Mr. Dollond of 42 inches focal length. They had\r\nmost distinct vision of a star, _when using an erecting eye-piece_,\r\nwhich made this telescope magnify more than a 100 times; and they found\r\nthe field of vision as uniformly distinct as with Dollond’s 42 inch\r\ntelescope magnifying 46 times; and were led to admire the nice figuring\r\nand centering of the very deep eye-glasses which were necessary for\r\nthis amplification. They saw double stars with a degree of perfection\r\nwhich astonished them. These telescopes, however, have never yet come\r\ninto general use; and one reason perhaps, is, that they are much more\r\napt to be deranged, than telescopes constructed of object-glasses\r\nwhich are solid. If any species of glass, or other solid transparent\r\nsubstance could be found with the same optical properties, instruments\r\nmight perhaps be constructed of a larger size, and considerably\r\nsuperior to our best achromatic telescopes.[23] It is said that Mr.\r\nBlair, the son of Dr. Blair, some years ago, was engaged in prosecuting\r\nhis father’s views, but I have not heard any thing respecting the\r\nresult of his investigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barlow’s refracting telescope with a fluid concave lens._\r\n\r\nProfessor Barlow, not many years ago, suggested a new fluid telescope,\r\nwhich is deserving of attention; and, about the year 1829 constructed\r\none of pretty large dimensions. The fluid he employs for this purpose\r\nis the _sulphuret of Carbon_, which he found to be a substance which\r\npossessed every requisite he could desire. Its index is nearly the\r\nsame as that of the best flint glass, with a dispersive power more\r\nthan double. It is perfectly colourless, beautifully transparent,\r\nand although very expansible, possesses the same, or very nearly\r\nthe same optical properties under all circumstances to which it is\r\nlikely to be exposed in astronomical observations--except perhaps,\r\ndirect observations on the solar disc, which will probably be found\r\ninadmissible. Mr. Barlow first constructed an object-glass with this\r\nfluid of 3 inches aperture, with which he could see the small star in\r\nPolaris with a power of 46, and with the higher powers several stars\r\nwhich are considered to require a good telescope, for example 70, ρ\r\nOphinchi, 39 Bootis, the quadruple star ε Lyræ, ζ Aquarii, α Herculis,\r\n&c. He next constructed a 6 inch object-glass. With this instrument\r\nthe small star in Polaris is so distinct and brilliant, with a power\r\nof 143, that its transit might be taken with the utmost certainty. As\r\nthe mode of constructing these telescopes is somewhat novel, it may be\r\nexpedient to enter somewhat into detail.\r\n\r\nIn the usual construction of achromatic telescopes, the two or three\r\nlenses composing the object-glass are brought into immediate contact;\r\nand in the fluid telescope of Dr. Blair, the construction was the same,\r\nthe fluid having been enclosed in the object-glass itself. But in Mr.\r\nBarlow’s telescope, the fluid correcting lens is placed at a distance\r\nfrom the plate lens equal to half its focal length; and it might be\r\ncarried still farther back, and yet possess dispersive power to render\r\nthe object-glass achromatic. By this means the fluid lens--which is the\r\nmost difficult part of the construction--is reduced to one half or\r\nto less than one half of the size of the plate lens; consequently, to\r\nconstruct a telescope of 10 or 12 inches aperture involves no greater\r\ndifficulty in the manipulation, than in making a telescope of the usual\r\ndescription of 5 or 6 inches aperture, except in the simple plate lens\r\nitself; and, hence, a telescope of this kind, of 10 or 12 feet length,\r\nwill be equivalent in its focal power to one of 16 or 20 feet. By this\r\nmeans, the tube may be shortened several feet and yet possess a focal\r\npower more considerable than could be conveniently given to it on the\r\nusual principle of construction. This will be better understood from\r\nthe annexed diagram. (fig. 61.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 61._]\r\n\r\nIn this figure ABCD represent the tube of the 6 inch telescope, CD, the\r\nplate object-glass, F the first focus of rays, _de_ the fluid concave\r\nlens, distant from the former 24 inches. The focal length MF being\r\n48, and consequently, as 48 : 6 :: 24 : 3 inches, the diameter of the\r\nfluid lens. The resulting compound focus is 62.5 inches. It is obvious,\r\ntherefore, that the rays _df_, _ef_, arrive at the focus under the same\r\nconvergency, and with the same light as if they proceeded from a lens\r\nof 6 inches diameter, placed at a distance beyond the object-glass\r\nCD (as GH,) determined by producing those rays till they meet the\r\nsides of the tube in GH, namely at 62.5 inches beyond the fluid lens.\r\nHence, it is obvious, the rays will converge as they would do from an\r\nobject-glass GH of the usual kind with a focus of 10 feet 5 inches. We\r\nhave thus, therefore, shortened the tube 38.5 inches, or have at least\r\nthe advantage of a focus 38.5 inches longer than our tube; and the\r\nsame principle may be carried much farther, so as to reduce the usual\r\nlength of refracting telescopes nearly one half without increasing\r\nthe aberration in the first glass beyond the least that can possibly\r\nbelong to a telescope of the usual kind of the whole length. It should\r\nlikewise be observed that the adjustment for focus may be made either\r\nin the usual way, or by a slight movement of the fluid lens, as in the\r\nGregorian Reflectors, by means of the small speculum.\r\n\r\nMr. Barlow afterwards constructed another and a larger telescope on the\r\nsame principle, the clear aperture of which is 7.8 inches. Its tube is\r\n11 feet, which, together with the eye-piece, makes the whole length\r\n12 feet, but its effective focus is on the principle stated above, 18\r\nfeet. It carries a power of 700 on the closest double stars in South’s\r\nand Herschel’s catalogue, and the stars are, with that power, round\r\nand defined, although the field is not then so bright as could be\r\ndesired. The telescope is mounted on a revolving stand, which works\r\nwith considerable accuracy as an azimuth and altitude instrument. To\r\ngive steadiness to the stand it has been made substantial and heavy;\r\nits weight by estimation being 400 pounds, and that of the telescope\r\n130 pounds, yet its motions are so smooth, and the power so arranged,\r\nthat it may be managed by one person with the greatest ease, the star\r\nbeing followed by a slight touch, scarcely exceeding that of the keys\r\nof a piano-forte. The focal length of the plate lens is 78 inches,\r\nand of the fluid lens 59.8 inches--which at the distance of 40 inches\r\nproduce a focal length of 104 inches, a total length of 12 feet, and\r\nan equivalent focus of 18 feet. The curves of the parallel meniscus\r\nchecks for containing the fluid are--30 inches, and 144 inches, the\r\nlatter towards the eye. The curves for the plate lens are 56.4 and\r\n144. There is an interior tube 5 inches diameter, and 3 feet 6 inches\r\nlong, which carries the cell in which the fluid is enclosed, and an\r\napparatus by which it may be moved backwards and forwards, so that\r\nthe proper adjustment may be made for colour, in the first instance,\r\nand afterwards the focus is obtained by the usual rack-work motion.\r\nThe following is the mode by which the fluid was enclosed. After the\r\nbest position has been determined practically for the checks forming\r\nthe fluid lens, these, with the ring between them ground and polished\r\naccurately to the same curves, are applied together, and taken into\r\nan artificial high temperature, exceeding the greatest at which the\r\ntelescope is ever expected to be used. After remaining here with the\r\nfluid some time, the space between the glasses is completely filled,\r\nimmediately closed, cooled down by evaporation, and removed into a\r\nlower temperature. By this means a sudden condensation takes place, an\r\nexternal pressure is brought on the checks, and a bubble formed inside,\r\nwhich is of course filled with the vapour of the fluid; the excess of\r\nthe atmospheric pressure beyond that of the vapour being afterwards\r\nalways acting externally to prevent contact. The extreme edges are then\r\nsealed with the serum of human blood, or by strong fish-glue, and some\r\nthin pliable metal surface. By this process, Mr. Barlow says, ‘I have\r\nevery reason to believe the lens becomes as durable as any lens of\r\nsolid glass. At all events I have the satisfaction of stating, that my\r\nfirst 3 inch telescope has now been completed more than fifteen months,\r\nand that no change whatever has taken place in its performance, nor the\r\nleast perceptible alteration either in the quantity or the quality of\r\nthe fluid.’\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the observations which have been made with\r\nthis telescope, and the tests to which it has been subjected. The very\r\nsmall star which accompanies the pole-star is generally one of the\r\nfirst tests applied to telescopes. This small point of light appeared\r\nbrilliant and distinct; it was best seen with a power of 120, but was\r\nvisible with a power of 700. The small star in Aldebaran was very\r\ndistinct with a power of 120. The small star α Lyræ was distinctly\r\nvisible with the same power. The small star called by Sir J. Herschel\r\n_Debilissima_, between 4 ε and 5 Lyræ, whose existence, he says, could\r\nnot be suspected in either the 5 or 7 feet equatorial, and invisible\r\nalso with the 7 and 10 feet reflectors of six and 9 inches aperture,\r\nbut seen double with the 20 feet reflector, is seen very satisfactorily\r\ndouble with this telescope. η Persei, marked as double in South and\r\nHerschel’s catalogue, at the distance of 28´´, with another small star\r\nat the distance of 3´ 67´´, is seen distinctly sixfold, four of the\r\nsmall stars being within a considerably less distance than the remote\r\none of η marked in the catalogue. And, rejecting the remote star, the\r\nprincipal, and the four other stars, form a miniature representation\r\nof Jupiter and his satellites, three of them being nearly in a line\r\non one side, and the other on the opposite. _Castor_, is distinctly\r\ndouble with 120, and well opened and stars perfectly round with 360\r\nand 700: γ Leonis and α Piscium are seen with the same powers equally\r\nround and distinct. In ε Bootis, the small star is well separated\r\nfrom the larger, and its blue colour well marked with a power of 360.\r\nη Coronæ Borealis is seen double with a power of 360 and 700. 52\r\nOrionis, ζ Orionis, and others of the same class are also well defined\r\nwith the same powers. In regard to the planets which happened to be\r\nvisible--Venus appeared beautifully white and well defined with a power\r\nof 120, but showed some colour with 360. Saturn with the 120 power,\r\nis a very brilliant object, the double ring and belts being well and\r\nsatisfactorily defined, and with the 360 power, it is still very fine.\r\nThe moon also is remarkably beautiful, the edges and the shadows being\r\nwell marked, while the quantity of light is such as to bring to view\r\nevery minute distinction of figure and shade.\r\n\r\nThe principal objections that may be made to this construction of a\r\ntelescope are such as these:--Can the fluid be permanently secured?\r\nWill it preserve its transparency and other optical properties? Will\r\nit not act upon the surface of the glass and partially destroy it? &c.\r\nTo such enquiries Mr. Barlow replies, that experience is the only test\r\nwe have; our spirit levels, spirit thermometers, &c., show that some\r\nfluids at least may be preserved for many years, without experiencing\r\nany change, and without producing any in the appearance of the glass\r\ntubes containing them. But should any of these happen, except the last,\r\nnothing can be more simple than to supply the means of replacing the\r\nfluid at any time, and by any person, without disturbing the adjustment\r\nof the telescope. He expresses his hope that, should these experiments\r\nbe prosecuted, an achromatic telescope may ultimately be produced\r\nwhich shall exceed in aperture and power, any instruments of the kind\r\nhitherto attempted. If the prejudice against the use of fluids could be\r\nremoved, he feels convinced that well-directed practice would soon lead\r\nto the construction of the most perfect instruments, on this principle,\r\nat a comparatively small expense. ‘I am convinced,’ he says, ‘judging\r\nfrom what has been paid for large object-glasses, that my telescope,\r\ntelescope stand, and the building for observation, with every other\r\nrequisite convenience, have been constructed for a less sum than would\r\nbe demanded for the object-glass only, if one could be produced of the\r\nsame diameter of plate and flint-glass; and this is a consideration\r\nwhich should have some weight, and encourage a perseverance in the\r\nprinciple of construction.’[24]\r\n\r\n\r\nROGERS’ ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE ON A NEW PLAN.\r\n\r\nThe object of this construction is to render a small disc of\r\nflint-glass available to perform the office of compensation to a much\r\nlarger one of crown-glass, and thus to render possible the construction\r\nof telescopes of much larger aperture than are now common, without\r\nhindrance from the difficulty at present experienced in procuring large\r\ndiscs of flint-glass. It is well known to those who are acquainted\r\nwith telescopes, that in the construction of an ordinary achromatic\r\nobject-glass, in which a single crown lens is compensated by a single\r\none of flint, the two lenses admit of being separated only by an\r\ninterval too small to afford any material advantage, _in diminishing\r\nthe diameter of the flint lens_, by placing it in a narrower part\r\nof the cone of rays--the actual amount of their difference in point\r\nof dispersive power being such as to render the correction of the\r\nchromatic aberration impossible, when their mutual distance exceeds\r\na certain limit. This inconvenience Mr. Rogers proposes to obviate,\r\nby employing, as a correcting lens--not a single lens of flint, but a\r\ncompound one consisting of a convex crown and concave flint, whose foci\r\nare such as to cause their combination to act as a plain glass on the\r\nmean refrangible rays. Then it is evident, that by means of the greater\r\ndispersive power of flint than of crown glass, this will act as a\r\nconcave on the violet, and as a convex on the red rays, and _that_ the\r\nmore powerfully, according as the lenses separately have greater powers\r\nor curvature. If then, such a compound lens be interposed between the\r\nobject-glass of a telescope--supposed to be a single lens of plate or\r\ncrown-glass--and its focus, it will cause no alteration in the focus\r\nfor mean rays, while it will lengthen the focus for violet, and shorten\r\nit for red rays. Now this is precisely what is wanted to produce an\r\nachromatic union of all the rays in the focus; and as nothing in this\r\nconstruction limits the powers of the individual correcting lenses,\r\nthey may therefore be applied any where that convenience may dictate;\r\nand thus, theoretically speaking, a disc of flint-glass, however small,\r\nmay be made to correct the colour of one of crown however large.\r\n\r\nThis construction, likewise, possesses other and very remarkable\r\nadvantages. For, first, when the correcting lens is approximately\r\nconstructed on a calculation founded on its intended aperture, and on\r\nthe refractive and dispersive indices of its materials, the final and\r\ncomplete dispersion of colour may be effected, not by altering the\r\nlenses by grinding them anew, but by shifting the combination nearer\r\nto, or farther from, the object-glass, as occasion may require, along\r\nthe tube of a telescope, by a screw motion, till the condition of\r\nachromaticity is satisfied in the best manner possible. And secondly,\r\nthe spherical aberration may in like manner be finally corrected, by\r\nslightly separating the lenses of the correcting glass, whose surfaces\r\nshould for this purpose be figured to curvatures previously determined\r\nby calculation, to admit of this mode of correction--a condition which\r\nMr. Rogers finds to be always possible. The following is the rule\r\nhe lays down for the determination of the foci of the lenses of the\r\ncorrecting glass:--‘The focal length of either lens of the correcting\r\nlens is to that of the object-glass, in a ratio compounded of the ratio\r\nof the square of the aperture of the correcting lens to that of the\r\nobject-glass, and of the ratio of the difference of the dispersive\r\nindices of the crown and flint glass, to the dispersive index of\r\ncrown.’ For example, to correct the colour of a lens of crown or plate\r\nglass of 9 inches aperture, and 14 feet focal length (the dimensions\r\nof the telescope of Fraunhofer at Dorpat) by a disc of flint glass 3\r\ninches in diameter, the focus of either lens of the correcting lens\r\nwill require to be about 9 inches. To correct it by a 4 inch disc will\r\nrequire a focus of about 16 inches each.\r\n\r\nMr. Rogers remarks, that it is not indispensable to make the\r\ncorrecting glass act as a plane lens. It is sufficient if it be so\r\nadjusted as to have a shorter focus for red rays than for violet.\r\nIf, preserving this condition, it be made to act as a concave lens,\r\nthe advantage procured by Mr. Barlow’s construction of reducing the\r\nlength of the telescope with the same focal power, is secured, and he\r\nconsiders, moreover, that by a proper adaptation of the distances,\r\nfoci, &c., of the lenses, we might hope to combine with all these\r\nadvantages that of the destruction of the secondary spectrum, and thus\r\nobtain a perfect telescope.\r\n\r\nThe above is an abstract of a paper read to the ‘Astronomical Society\r\nof London’ in April 1828, by A. Rogers, Esq.\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily perceive that the principle on which Mr.\r\nRogers proposes to construct his telescope is very nearly similar\r\nto that of professor Barlow, described above, with this difference,\r\nthat the correcting lens of the Professor’s telescope is composed of\r\na transparent _fluid_, while that of Mr. Rogers is a _solid_ lens\r\nconsisting of a convex crown and concave flint. The general object\r\nintended to be accomplished by both is the same, namely, to make a\r\ncorrecting lens of a comparatively small diameter serve the purpose of\r\na large disc of flint glass, which has hitherto been very expensive,\r\nand very difficult to be procured; and likewise to reduce the length of\r\nthe telescope while the advantage of a long focal power is secured.--A\r\ntelescope, on this principle, was constructed 7 or 8 years ago by\r\nMr. Wilson, lecturer on Philosophy and Chemistry, Glasgow, before he\r\nwas aware that Mr. Rogers had proposed a similar plan. I have had an\r\nopportunity of particularly inspecting Mr. Wilson’s telescope, and\r\ntrying its effects on terrestrial objects with high powers, and was on\r\nthe whole highly pleased with its performance. It appeared to be almost\r\nperfectly achromatic, and produced a distinct and _well-defined_ image\r\nof minute distant objects, such as small letters on sign-posts, at 2,\r\n3 and 4 miles distant. But I had no opportunity of trying its effects\r\non double stars or any other celestial objects. The instrument is above\r\n6 feet long; the object lens is a plano-convex of crown glass 4 feet\r\nfocal distance, and 4 inches diameter, the plain side next the object.\r\n\r\nAt 26 inches distant from the object lens is the compound lens of 2\r\ninches in diameter; and the two lenses of which it is composed are\r\nboth ground to a radius of 3-3/4 inches. That made of crown glass is\r\n_plano-convex_, the other, made of flint glass, is plano-concave, and\r\nare placed close together, the convex side being next the object, and\r\nthe concave side next the eye. The greater refractive power of the\r\nflint glass renders the compound one slightly concave in its effect\r\n(although the radius of curvature is similar in both), and lengthens\r\nthe focus to 6 feet from the object-glass; and this is consequently the\r\nlength of the instrument. The compound corrector so placed intercepts\r\nall those rays which go to form the image in the field of view,\r\nproducing there an achromatic image. The concave power of the corrector\r\nrenders the image larger than if directly produced by a convex lens\r\nof the same focus. The concavity of the corrector is valuable also in\r\nthis respect, that a very slight alteration in its distance from the\r\nobject-glass, changes the focal distance much more than if it were\r\nplain, and enables us to adjust the instrument to perfect achromatism\r\nwith great precision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nON REFLECTING TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nSECT. 1.--HISTORY OF THE INVENTION, AND A GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\nReflecting telescopes are those which represent the images of distant\r\nobjects by reflection, chiefly from concave mirrors.\r\n\r\nBefore the achromatic telescope was invented, there were two glaring\r\nimperfections in refracting telescopes, which the astronomers of\r\nthe 17th century were anxious to correct. The first was its very\r\ngreat length when a high power was to be applied, which rendered it\r\nvery unwieldy and difficult to use. The second imperfection was the\r\nincorrectness of the image as formed by a single lens. Mathematicians\r\nhad demonstrated that a pencil of rays could not be collected in a\r\nsingle point by a spherical lens, and also that the image transmitted\r\nby such a lens would be in some degree incurvated. After several\r\nattempts had been made to correct this imperfection by grinding lenses\r\nto the figure of one of the conic sections, Sir I. Newton happened to\r\ncommence an examination of the colours formed by a prism; and having,\r\nby the means of this simple instrument, discovered the different\r\nrefrangibility of the rays of light--to which we have several times\r\nadverted in the preceding descriptions--he then perceived that the\r\nerrors of telescopes, arising from that cause alone, were some hundred\r\ntimes greater than such as were occasioned by the spherical figure\r\nof lenses; which induced this illustrious philosopher to turn his\r\nattention to the improvement of telescopes by reflection.\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that Mr. James Gregory--a son of the Rev. John\r\nGregory, minister of Drumoak in the county of Aberdeen--was the first\r\nwho suggested the construction of a reflecting telescope. He was a\r\nyoung man of uncommon genius, and an eminent mathematician; and in the\r\nyear 1663, at the age of only 24, he published in London, his treatise\r\nentitled ‘Optica Promota,’ in which he explained the theory of that\r\nspecies of reflecting telescope which still bears his name, and which\r\nhe stated as being his own invention. But as Gregory, according to his\r\nown account, was endowed with no mechanical dexterity, and could find\r\nno workman capable of realizing his invention--after some fruitless\r\nattempts to form proper specula, he was obliged to give up the pursuit;\r\nso that this telescope remained for a considerable time neglected.\r\nIt was several years after Gregory suggested the construction of\r\nreflecting telescopes, till Newton directed his attention fully to the\r\nsubject. In a letter addressed to the secretary of the Royal Society,\r\ndated in February, 1672, he says, ‘Finding reflections to be regular,\r\nso that the angle of reflection of all sorts of rays was equal to\r\nthe angle of incidence, I understood that, by their mediation, optic\r\ninstruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable,\r\nproviding a reflecting substance could be found which would polish as\r\nfinely as glass, and reflect as much light as glass transmits, and the\r\nart of communicating to it a parabolic figure be also obtained. Amidst\r\nthese thoughts I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening plague,\r\nand it was more than two years before I proceeded further.’\r\n\r\nIt was towards the end of 1668, or in the beginning of the following\r\nyear, when Newton, being obliged to have recourse to reflectors, and\r\nnot relying on any artificer for making the specula, set about the work\r\nhimself, and early in the year 1672, completed two small reflecting\r\ntelescopes. In these he ground the great speculum into a spherical\r\nconcave, although he approved of the parabolic form, but found himself\r\nunable to accomplish it. These telescopes were of a construction\r\nsomewhat different from what Gregory had suggested, and though only 6\r\ninches long, were considered as equal to a 6 feet common refracting\r\ntelescope. It is not a little singular, however, that we hear no more\r\nabout the construction of reflectors till more than half a century\r\nafterwards. It was not till the year 1723, that any reflectors were\r\nknown to have been made, adapted to celestial observations. In that\r\nyear, Mr. Hadley, the inventor of the reflecting quadrant, which goes\r\nby his name, published in No. 376 of the Philosophical Transactions, an\r\naccount of a large reflector on Newton’s plan, which he had just then\r\nconstructed, the performance of which left no room to doubt that this\r\ninvention would remain any longer in obscurity. The large speculum of\r\nthis instrument was 62-5/8 inches focal distance and 5 inches diameter,\r\nwas furnished with magnifying powers of from 190 to 230 times, and\r\nequalled in performance the famous aerial telescope of Huygens of 123\r\nfeet in length.[25] Since this period, the reflecting telescope has\r\nbeen in general use among astronomers in most countries of Europe,\r\nand has received numerous improvements, under the direction of Short,\r\nMudge, Edwards and Herschel--the last of whom constructed reflectors\r\nof 7, 10, 20, and even 40 feet in focal length, which far surpassed,\r\nin brightness and magnifying power, all the instruments of this\r\ndescription, which had previously been attempted.\r\n\r\nI shall now proceed to give a brief sketch of the nature of a\r\nreflecting telescope, and the different forms in which they have been\r\nproposed to be constructed.\r\n\r\nFig. 62 represents the reflecting telescope as originally proposed\r\nby Gregory. ABEF represents a tube open at AF towards the object; at\r\nthe other end is placed a concave speculum BE, with a hole CD in its\r\ncentre, the focus of which is at _e_. A little beyond this focus,\r\ntowards the object end of the telescope AF, is placed another small\r\nconcave mirror G, having its polished face turned towards the great\r\nspeculum, and is supported by an arm GH fastened to a slider connected\r\nwith the tube. At the end of the great tube BE is screwed in a small\r\ntube CDKI, containing a small plano-convex lens IK. Such are the\r\nessential parts of this instrument and their relative positions. It\r\nwill be recollected in our description of the properties of concave\r\nmirrors (see page 92), that, when rays proceed from a distant object,\r\nand fall upon a concave-speculum, they paint an image or representation\r\nof the object in its focus before the speculum. Now suppose two\r\nparallel rays _ab_ falling on the speculum BE, in _cd_; they are\r\nreflected to its focus _e_ where an inverted image of the object is\r\nformed. This image is formed at a little more than the focal distance\r\nof the small speculum from its surface, and serves as it were for an\r\nobject on which the small mirror may act. By the action of this mirror\r\nthis first image is reflected to a point about _f_, where a second\r\nimage is formed very large and erect. This image is magnified in the\r\nproportion of _f_G to _e_G, the rays from which are transmitted to the\r\neye glass IK, through which the eye perceives the object clear and\r\ndistinct, after the proper adjustments have been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 62._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 63._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 64._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 65._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 66._]\r\n\r\nSuppose the focal distance of the great mirror was 9 inches, and the\r\nfocal distance of the small mirror 1-1/2 inch--were we to remove the\r\neye piece of this telescope, and look through the hole of the great\r\nmirror, we should see the image of the object depicted upon the face of\r\nthe small speculum, and magnified, in the proportion of 9 to 1-1/2, or,\r\n6 times, on the same principle as a common convex object glass 9 inches\r\nfocal length, with an eye glass whose focus is 1-1/2 inch magnifies 6\r\ntimes. This may be regarded as the first part of the magnifying power.\r\nIf now, we suppose the small speculum placed a little more than 1-1/2\r\ninch from the image formed by the great speculum, a second image is\r\nformed about _f_, as much exceeding the first in its dimensions as it\r\nexceeds it in distance from the small speculum, on the principle on\r\nwhich the object glass of a compound microscope forms a large image\r\nnear the eye glass. Suppose this distance to be 9 times greater, then\r\nthe whole magnifying power will be compounded of 6 multiplied by 9, or\r\n54 times. As a telescope it magnifies 6 times, and in the microscope\r\npart 9 times.--Such is a _general_ idea of the Gregorian telescope, the\r\nminute particulars and structure of which can only be clearly perceived\r\nby a direct inspection of the instrument.\r\n\r\n_The Newtonian Reflector._--This instrument is somewhat different\r\nboth in its form and in its mode of operation from that of Gregory.\r\nIt is represented in fig. 63, where BAEF is the tube, and BE, the\r\nobject concave mirror, which reflects the parallel rays _ab_ to a\r\n_plane_ speculum G, placed 45°, or half a right angle to the axis of\r\nthe concave speculum. This small plane reflector must be of an oval\r\nform, the length of the oval should be to the breadth as 7 to 5, on\r\naccount of the obliquity of its position. It is supported on an arm\r\nfixed to the side of the tube; an eye-glass is placed in a small tube,\r\nmoveable in the larger tube, so as to be perpendicular to the axis of\r\nthe large reflector, the perpendicular line passing through the centre\r\nof the small mirror. The small mirror is situated between the large\r\nmirror and its focus, that its distance from this focal point may be\r\nequal to the distance from the centre of the mirror to the focus of the\r\neye-glass. When the rays _ab_ from a distant object fall upon the large\r\nspeculum at _cd_, they are reflected towards a focus at _h_; but being\r\nintercepted by the plane mirror G, they are reflected perpendicularly\r\nto the eye-glass at I, in the side of the tube, and the image formed\r\nnear that position at _e_ is viewed through a small plano-convex lens.\r\nThe magnifying power of this telescope is in the proportion of the\r\nfocal distance of the speculum to that of the eye-glass. Thus, if the\r\nfocal distance of the speculum be 36 inches, and that of the eye-glass\r\n1/3 of an inch, the magnifying power will be 108 times. It was this\r\nform of the reflecting telescope, that Newton invented, which Sir. W.\r\nHerschel adopted, and with which he made most of his observations and\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n_The Cassegrainian Reflector._--This mode of the reflecting telescope,\r\nsuggested by M. Cassegrain, a Frenchman, is represented in fig. 64. It\r\nis constructed in the same way as the Gregorian, with the exception of\r\na small _convex_ speculum G being substituted in the room of the small\r\nconcave in Gregory’s construction. As the focus of a convex mirror is\r\nnegative, it is placed at a distance from the large speculum equal to\r\nthe difference of their foci, that is, if the focal length of the large\r\nspeculum be 18 inches, and that of the small convex 2 inches, they are\r\nplaced at 16 inches distant from each other, on a principle similar\r\nto that of the Galilean telescope, in which the concave eye-glass is\r\nplaced within the focus of the object-glass by a space equal to the\r\nfocal length of the eye-glass. In this telescope, likewise, instead\r\nof two there is only _one image_ formed, namely that in the focus\r\nof the eye-glass; and, on this account some are of opinion that the\r\ndistinctness is considerably greater than in the Gregorian. Mr. Ramsden\r\nwas of opinion that this construction is preferable to either of the\r\nformer reflectors, because the aberrations of the two metals have a\r\ntendency to correct each other, whereas in the Gregorian both the\r\nmetals being concave, any error in the specula will be doubled. It is\r\nhis opinion that the aberrations in the Cassegrainian construction\r\nto that of the Gregorian is as 3 to 5. The length of this telescope\r\nis shorter than that of a Gregorian of equal focal length, by twice\r\nthe focal length of the small mirror, and it shows every thing in\r\nan _inverted_ position, and consequently is not adapted for viewing\r\nterrestrial objects.\r\n\r\n_Dr. Hook’s Reflector._--Before the reflecting telescope was much\r\nknown, Dr. Hook contrived one, the form of which is represented, fig.\r\n65, which differs in little or nothing from the Gregorian, except that\r\nthe eye-glass I is placed in the hole of the great speculum BE.\r\n\r\n_Martin’s Reflector._--Mr. Bengamin Martin, a distinguished writer on\r\noptical and philosophical science, about a century ago, described a\r\nnew form of the reflecting telescope, approximating to the Newtonian\r\nstructure, which he contrived for his own use. It is represented in\r\nfig. 66. ABEF is the tube, in which there is an opening or aperture OP,\r\nin the upper part. Against this hole within the tube is placed a large\r\nplane speculum GH, at half a right angle with the axis or sides of the\r\ntubes, with a hole CD perforated through its middle. The parallel rays\r\n_a b_ falling on the inclined plane GH are reflected perpendicularly\r\nand parallel on the great speculum BE in the bottom of the tube. From\r\nthence they are reflected converging to a focus _e_ through the hole of\r\nthe plane mirror CD, which being also the focus of the eye-glass IK,\r\nthe eye will perceive the object magnified and distinct.\r\n\r\nIn the figures referred to in the above descriptions, only one\r\neye-glass is represented to avoid complexity; but in most reflecting\r\ntelescopes, the eye-piece consists of a combination of two plano-convex\r\nglasses, as in fig. 67, which produces a more correct and a larger\r\nfield of view than a single lens. This combination is generally known\r\nby the name of the _Huygenian eye-piece_ which shall be described in\r\nthe section on the _eye-pieces_ of telescopes.\r\n\r\nThe following rule has been given for finding the magnifying power of\r\nthe Gregorian telescope:--Multiply the focal distance of the great\r\nmirror by the distance of the small mirror from the image next the\r\neye; and multiply the focal distance of the small mirror by the focal\r\ndistance of the eye-glass; then divide the product of the former\r\nmultiplication by the product of the latter, and the quotient will\r\nexpress the magnifying power. The following are the dimensions of one\r\nof the reflecting telescopes constructed by Mr. Short--who was long\r\ndistinguished as the most eminent maker of such instruments, on a large\r\nscale, and whose large reflectors are still to be found in various\r\nobservatories throughout Europe.\r\n\r\nThe focal distance of the great mirror 9.6 inches; or P _m_, fig. 67,\r\nits breadth FD 2.3; the focal distance of the small mirror L _n_\r\n1.5--or 1-1/2 inch--its breadth _g h_ 0.6--or 6/10 of an inch; the\r\nbreadth of the hole in the great mirror UV, 0.5--or half an inch--the\r\ndistance between the small mirror and the next eye-glass LR, 14.2; the\r\ndistance between the two eye-glasses SR, 2.4; the focal distance of the\r\neye-glass next the metal, 3.8.; and the focal distance of the eye-glass\r\nnext the eye, S _a_ 1.1, or one inch and one tenth. The magnifying\r\npower of this telescope was about 60 times. Taking this telescope as a\r\nstandard, the following table of the dimensions and magnifying powers\r\nof Gregorian reflecting telescopes, as constructed by Mr. Short, has\r\nbeen computed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 67._]\r\n\r\n  A: Focal distance of the great mirror.\r\n  B: Breadth of the great mirror.\r\n  C: Focus of the small speculum.\r\n  D: Breadth of the hole in the great speculum.\r\n  E: Distance between the small speculum and the first eye-glass.\r\n  F: Focal distance of the glass next the metals.\r\n  G: Focal distance of the glass next the eye.\r\n  H: Distance between the plain sides of the two glasses.\r\n  I: Magnifying power.\r\n  J: Distance between the second glass and the small eye-hole.\r\n  --------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n          |        |        |        |\r\n      A.  |   B.   |  C.    |   D.   |   E.\r\n  --------+--------+--------+--------+--------\r\n          |        |        |        |\r\n   P  _m_ | D   F  | L  _n_ | U   V  | L   R\r\n          |        |        |        |\r\n  In.

In\r\n1743, he constructed a reflector for Lord Thomas Spencer, of 12 feet\r\nfocal length, for which he received 600 guineas. He made several other\r\ntelescopes of the same focal distance, with greater improvements and\r\nhigher magnifiers; and in 1752, finished one for the king of Spain, for\r\nwhich, with its whole apparatus, he received £1200. This was considered\r\nthe noblest instrument of its kind that had then been constructed, and\r\nperhaps it was never surpassed, till Herschel constructed his twenty\r\nand forty feet reflectors. High as the prices of large telescopes now\r\nare, Mr. Short charged for his instruments at a much higher rate than\r\nopticians now do, although the price of labour, and every other article\r\nrequired in the construction of a telescope, is now much dearer. But\r\nhe had then scarcely any competitor, and he spared neither trouble nor\r\nexpense to make his telescopes perfect, and put such a price upon them\r\nas properly repaid him. The following table contains a statement of the\r\napertures, powers, and prices of Gregorian telescopes, as constructed\r\nby Mr. James Short.[26]\r\n\r\n  A: Number.\r\n  B: Focal length in inches.\r\n  C: Diameter of aperture in inches.\r\n  D: Prices in guineas.\r\n  -----+---------+------+-----------------------------------+----\r\n       |         |      |                                   |\r\n    A. |    B.   |  C.  |        Magnifying powers.         | D.\r\n  -----+---------+------+-----------------------------------+----\r\n    1  |   3     |  1.1 | 1 Power of               18 times |   3\r\n    2  |   4-1/2 |  1.3 | 1 \"                      25   \"   |   4\r\n    3  |   7     |  1.9 | 1 \"                      40   \"   |   6\r\n    4  |   9-1/2 |  2.5 | 2 Powers       40  and   60   \"   |   8\r\n    5} |  12     |  3.0 | 2 \"            55  and   85   \"   |  10\r\n    6} |  12     |  3.0 | 4 \"  35,  55,  85, and  110   \"   |  14\r\n    7  |  18     |  3.8 | 4 \"  55,  95, 130, and  200   \"   |  20\r\n    8  |  24     |  4.5 | 4 \"  90, 150, 230, and  300   \"   |  35\r\n    9  |  36     |  6.3 | 4 \" 100, 200, 300, and  400   \"   |  75\r\n   10  |  48     |  7.6 | 4 \" 120, 260, 380, and  500   \"   | 100\r\n   11  |  72     | 12.2 | 4 \" 200, 400, 600, and  800   \"   | 300\r\n   12  | 144     | 18.0 | 4 \" 300, 600, 900, and 1200   \"   | 800\r\n\r\nFrom this table, it appears that Mr. Short charged 75 guineas for a 3\r\nfeet reflector, whereas such an instrument is now marked in the London\r\nopticians’ catalogues at £23, when mounted on a common brass stand, and\r\n£39. 18s., when accompanied with rack-work motions and other apparatus.\r\nIt is now generally understood that in the above table, Short always\r\ngreatly _overrated_ the higher powers of his telescopes. By experiment\r\nthey were generally found to magnify _much less_ than here expressed.\r\n\r\n_General remarks on Gregorian Reflectors._--1. In regard to the hole\r\nUV, of the great speculum--its diameter should be equal, or nearly\r\nso, to that of the small speculum L, fig. 67. For if it be less, no\r\nmore parallel rays will be reflected than if it were equal to _g h_,\r\nand it may do harm in contracting the visible area within too narrow\r\nlimits. Nor must it be larger than the mirror L, because some parallel\r\nrays will then be lost, and those of most consequence as being nearest\r\nthe centre. 2. The small hole at _e_ to which the eye is applied,\r\nmust be nicely adjusted to the size of the cone of rays proceeding\r\nfrom the nearest lens S. If it be larger, it will permit the foreign\r\nlight of the sky or other objects to enter the eye, so as to prevent\r\ndistinct vision; for the eye should receive no light, but what comes\r\nfrom the surface of the small mirror L. If the hole be smaller than\r\nthe cylinder of rays at _e_ then some of the necessary light will be\r\nexcluded, and the object rendered more obscure. The diameter of this\r\nhole may be found by dividing the aperture of the telescope in inches\r\nby its magnifying power. Thus, if we divide the diameter of one of\r\nShort’s telescopes, the diameter of whose large speculum is 2.30, by\r\n60, the magnifying power, the quotient will be .0383, which is nearly\r\nthe 1/25 of an inch. Sometimes this hole is made so small as the 1/50\r\nof an inch. When this hole is, by any derangement, shifted from its\r\nproper position, it sometimes requires great nicety to adjust it, and,\r\nbefore it is accurately adjusted, the telescope is unfit for accurate\r\nobservation. 3. It is usual to fix a plate with a hole in it, at _a b_,\r\nthe focus of the eye glass S, of such a diameter as will circumscribe\r\nthe image, so as to exhibit only that part of it which appears\r\ndistinct, and to exclude the superfluous rays. 4. There is an adjusting\r\nscrew on the outside of the great tube, connected with the small\r\nspeculum, by which that speculum may be pushed backwards or forwards to\r\nadjust the instrument to distinct vision. The hand is applied for this\r\npurpose at T.\r\n\r\n_Newtonian Telescopes._--These telescopes are now more frequently\r\nused for celestial observations than during the last century, when\r\nGregorian reflectors were generally preferred. Sir W. Herschel was\r\nchiefly instrumental in introducing this form of the reflecting\r\ntelescope to the more particular attention of astronomers, by the\r\nsplendour and extent of the discoveries which it enabled him to make.\r\nIn this telescope there is no hole required in the middle of the great\r\nspeculum, as in the Gregorian construction, which circumstance secures\r\nthe use of all the rays which flow from the central parts of the mirror.\r\n\r\nThe following table contains a statement of the apertures and\r\nmagnifying powers of Newtonian Telescopes, and the focal distances of\r\ntheir eye-glasses. The first column contains the focal length of the\r\ngreat speculum in feet; the second, its linear aperture in inches;\r\nthe third, the focal distance of the single glass in decimals, or in\r\n1000ths of an inch, and the fourth column, contains the magnifying\r\npower. This portion of the table was constructed by using the\r\ndimensions of Mr. Hadley’s Newtonian Telescope, formerly referred to,\r\nas a standard--the focal distance of the great mirror being 62-1/2\r\ninches, its medium aperture 5 inches, and power 208. The fifth, sixth,\r\nand seventh columns contains the apertures of the concave speculum,\r\nthe focal lengths of the eye-glasses and the magnifying powers, as\r\ncalculated by Sir D. Brewster, from a telescope of Mr. Hauksbee, taken\r\nas a standard; whose focal length was 3 feet 3 inches, its aperture\r\nabout 4 inches, and magnifying power 226 times.\r\n\r\n  A: Focal distance  of concave metal.\r\n  B: Aperture of concave metal.\r\n  C: Focal distance of single eye-glass.\r\n  D: Magnifying power.\r\n  E: Aperture of the concave speculum.\r\n  F: Focal length of the eye-glass.\r\n  G: Magnifying power.\r\n  --------+----------+----------++----------------------------------\r\n          |          |          ||\r\n          |          |          ||    Sir D.

It will\r\nbe perceived from the above table, that the focal length of the eye\r\nglasses is very small, the lowest there stated being only about 1/10\r\nof an inch, and the highest little more than 1/4 of an inch focal\r\ndistance. Sir W. Herschel obtained the high powers which he sometimes\r\nput upon his telescopes, by using small double convex lenses for eye\r\nglasses, some of which did not exceed the _one fiftieth of an inch_ in\r\nfocal length. When the focal length of the concave speculum, and that\r\nof the eye glass are given, the magnifying power is found by dividing\r\nthe former by the latter, after having reduced the focal length of the\r\nconcave speculum to inches. Thus the 6 feet speculum, multiplied by 12,\r\nproduces 72 inches, which, divided by Brewster’s number for the focus\r\nof the eye glass = 200, or 1/5 of an inch, produces a quotient of 360\r\nas the magnifying power. It has been calculated that, if the metals\r\nof a Newtonian telescope be worked as exquisitely as those in Sir W.\r\nHerschel’s 7 feet reflector, the highest power that such a telescope\r\nshould bear with perfect distinctness, will be found by multiplying the\r\ndiameter of the great speculum in inches, by 74, and the focal distance\r\nof the single eye glass may be found by dividing the focal distance of\r\nthe great mirror by the magnifying power. Thus 6.25--the aperture in\r\ninches of Herschel’s 7 feet Newtonian--multiplied by 74 is 462-1/2, the\r\nmagnifying power; and 7 multiplied by 12, and divided by 462.5 is 0.182\r\nof an inch, the focal distance of the single eye glass required. But\r\nit is seldom that more than one half of this power can be applied with\r\neffect to any of the planetary bodies. For general purposes the power\r\nproduced by multiplying the diameter of the speculum by 30, or 40, will\r\nbe found most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe following are the general prices of reflecting telescopes as made\r\nby the London opticians.\r\n\r\n                                                           £ _s._\r\n  A four feet, seven inch aperture, Gregorian Reflector; with\r\n  the vertical motions upon a new invented principle, as well as\r\n  apparatus to render the tube more steady in observation;\r\n  according to the additional apparatus of small speculums,\r\n  eye-pieces, micrometers, &c. from                  80 to 120 0\r\n\r\n  Three feet long, mounted on a plain brass stand         23   2\r\n\r\n  Ditto, with rack-work motions, improved mounting, and\r\n  metals                                                  39  18\r\n\r\n  Two feet long without rack-work, and with 4 magnifying\r\n  powers, improved                                        15  15\r\n\r\n  Ditto with rack-work motion                             22   1\r\n\r\n  Eighteen inch on a plain stand                           9   9\r\n\r\n  Twelve inch Ditto                                        6   6\r\n\r\nThe above are the prices stated in Messrs.

This result,\r\nif correct, must be owing to the small number of rays reflected from\r\na speculum compared with the number transmitted through an achromatic\r\nobject glass.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 2.--THE HERSCHELIAN TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nSoon after Sir William Herschel commenced his astronomical career, he\r\nintroduced a new era in the history of reflecting telescopes. After he\r\nhad cast and polished an immense variety of specula for telescopes of\r\ndifferent sizes-he, at length, in the year 1782, finished a 20 feet\r\nreflector with a large aperture. Being sensible of the vast quantity\r\nof light which is lost by a second reflection from the small speculum,\r\nhe determined to throw it aside altogether, and mounted this 20 feet\r\nreflector on a stand that admitted of being used without a small\r\nspeculum in making _front observations_--that is, in sitting with his\r\nback to the object, and looking directly towards the surface of the\r\nspeculum. Many of his discoveries and measurements of double stars were\r\nmade with this instrument, till, at length, in the year 1785 he put\r\nthe finishing hand to that gigantic speculum, which soon became the\r\nobject of universal astonishment, and which was intended for his _forty\r\nfeet_ reflecting telescope; he had succeeded so well in constructing\r\nreflecting telescopes of comparatively small aperture, that they would\r\nbear higher magnifying powers than had ever previously been applied;\r\nbut he found that a deficiency of light could only be remedied by an\r\nincreased diameter of the large speculum, which therefore was his main\r\nobject, when he undertook to accomplish a work which to a man less\r\nenterprising, would have appeared impracticable. The difficulties he\r\nhad to overcome were numerous; particularly in the operative department\r\nof preparing, melting, annealing, grinding, and polishing a mass of\r\nmetal that was too unwieldly to be moved without the aid of mechanical\r\npowers. At length, however, all difficulties having been overcome,\r\nthis magnificent instrument was completed with all its complicated\r\napparatus, and erected for observation, on the 28th of August, 1789,\r\nand on the same day the sixth satellite of Saturn was detected, as a\r\nprelude of still farther discoveries which were afterwards made by this\r\ninstrument, in the celestial regions.\r\n\r\nIt would be too tedious to attempt a description of all the machinery\r\nand apparatus connected with this noble instrument. The reader\r\nwho wishes to peruse a minute description of the stairs, ladders,\r\nplatform, rollers, and of every circumstance relating to joiner’s work,\r\ncarpenter’s work, smith’s work, and other particulars connected with\r\nthe formation and erection of this telescope, will find the details\r\nrecorded in the 85th volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the\r\nRoyal Society of London, for 1795, in which there are sixty-three pages\r\nof letter press, and eighteen plates illustrative of the subject. I\r\nshall content myself with giving a short outline of the essential parts\r\nbelonging to this instrument.\r\n\r\nThe _tube_ of this telescope is made of rolled or sheet iron, joined\r\ntogether without rivets; the thickness of the sheets is somewhat less\r\nthan 1/36 part of an inch, or 14 pounds weight for a square foot;\r\ngreat care was taken that the cylindrical form should be secured, and\r\nthe whole was coated over three or four times with paint, inside and\r\noutside, to secure it against the damp. This tube was removed from\r\nthe place in which it was formed by twenty-four men, divided into six\r\nsets; so that two men on each side, with a pole of 5 feet long in\r\ntheir hands, to which was affixed a piece of course cloth, 7 feet long\r\ngoing under the tube, and joined to a pole 5 feet long, in the hands\r\nof two other men, assisted in carrying the tube. The _length_ of this\r\ntube is 39 feet 4 inches, the diameter 4 feet 10 inches; and, on a\r\nmoderate computation, it was ascertained, that a wooden tube of proper\r\ndimensions would have exceeded an iron one in weight by at least 3000\r\npounds. Reckoning the circumference of the tube 15 feet, its length\r\n39-1/3 feet, and 14 lib. for the weight of a square foot, it must have\r\ncontained 590 square feet, and weighed 8,260 pounds. Various hoops were\r\nfixed within the tube, and longitudinal bars of iron connecting some of\r\nthem are attached to the two ends of the tube, by way of bracing the\r\nsheets, and preserving the shape perfect, when the pulleys are applied\r\nto give the necessary elevation at the upper end, and that the speculum\r\nmay be kept secure at the lower end. The lower end of the tube is\r\nfirmly supported on rollers that are capable of being moved forwards or\r\nbackwards by a double rack, connected with a set of wheels and pinions.\r\nBy an adjustment at the lower extremity of the tube, the speculum is\r\nturned to a small inclination, so that the line of collimation may not\r\nbe coincident with the longitudinal axis of the tube, but may cross the\r\ntube diagonally, and meet the eye in the air at about two inches from\r\nthe edge of the tube, which is the peculiarity of the construction,\r\nthat supersedes the necessity of applying a second reflector. Hence no\r\npart of the head of the observer intercepts the incident rays, and the\r\nobservation is taken with the face looking at the speculum, the back\r\nbeing turned to the object to be observed.\r\n\r\nThe large speculum is enclosed in a strong iron ring, braced across\r\nwith bars of iron, and an enclosure of iron and ten sheets makes a case\r\nfor it. It is lifted by three handles of iron attached to the sides of\r\nthe ring, and is put into and taken out of its proper place in the tube\r\nby the help of a moveable crane, running on a carriage, which operation\r\nrequires great care. The speculum is made of a metallic composition,\r\nand is 49-1/2 inches in diameter; but the concave polished surface is\r\nonly 48 inches, or 4 feet in diameter. Its thickness is 31 inches; and\r\nwhen it came from the cast its weight was 2118 pounds. The metals for\r\nits formation were procured at a warehouse in Thames Street, London,\r\nwhere they kept ingots of two kinds ready made, one of white, and the\r\nother of bell-metal; and it was composed of two ingots of bell-metal\r\nfor one of white. It was not to be expected that a speculum of such\r\nlarge dimensions, could have a perfect figure imparted to its surface,\r\nnor that the curve, whatever it might be, would remain identically the\r\nsame in changes of temperature; therefore we are not surprised when we\r\nare told, that the magnifying powers used with this telescope seldom\r\nexceeded 200; the quantity of light collected by so large a surface\r\nbeing the principal aim of the maker. The raising of the balcony, on\r\nwhich the observer stands, and the sliding of the lower end of the\r\ntube, in which the speculum rests, are effected by separate tackles,\r\nand require only occasional motions; but the elevation of the telescope\r\nrequires the main tackle to be employed, and the motion usually given\r\nin altitude at once was two degrees; the breadth of the zone in which\r\nthe observations were made, as the motion of the sphere in right\r\nascension brought the objects into view. A star, however, could be\r\nfollowed for about a quarter of an hour. Three persons were employed\r\nin using this telescope, one to work the tackle, another to observe,\r\nand a third to mark down the observations. The elevation was pointed\r\nout by a small quadrant fixed to the main tube, near the lower end, but\r\nthe polar distance was indicated by a piece of machinery, worked by a\r\nstring, which continually indicated the degree and minute on a dial in\r\nthe small house adjoining, while the time was shown by a clock in the\r\nsame place, Miss Herschel performing the office of Registrar.\r\n\r\nAt the upper end the tube is open, and directed to the part of the\r\nheavens intended for observation, and the observer, standing on the\r\nfoot board, looks down the tube, and perceives the object by rays\r\nreflected from the speculum, through the eye glass at the opening\r\nof the tube. When the telescope is directed to any objects near the\r\nzenith, the observer is necessarily at an elevation at least 40 feet\r\nfrom the ground. Near the place of the eye glass is the end of a tin\r\npipe, into which a mouth-piece may be placed, so that, during an\r\nobservation, a person may direct his voice into this pipe, while his\r\neye is at the glass. This pipe, which is 1-1/2 inch in diameter runs\r\ndown to the bottom of the tube, where it goes into a turning joint,\r\nthence into a drawing tube, and out of this into another turning joint,\r\nfrom whence it proceeds, by a set of sliding tubes towards the front of\r\nthe foundation timber. Its use is to convey the voice of the observer\r\nto his assistants, for at the last place, it divides itself into two\r\nbranches, one going into the observatory, the other into the workman’s\r\nroom, ascending in both places through the floor, and terminates in\r\nthe usual shape of speaking trumpets. Though the voice passes in this\r\nmanner through a tube, with many inflections, and through not less than\r\n115 feet, it requires very little exertion to be well understood.\r\n\r\nTo direct so unwieldy a body to any part of the heavens at pleasure,\r\nmany mechanical contrivances were evidently necessary. The whole\r\napparatus rests upon rollers, and care was previously taken of the\r\nfoundation in the ground. This consists of concentrical brick walls,\r\nthe outermost 42 feet, the innermost 21 feet in diameter, 2 feet 6\r\ninches deep under ground, 2 feet 3 inches broad at the bottom, and 1\r\nfoot 2 inches at the top, capped with paving stones 3 inches thick, and\r\n12-3/4 inches broad.\r\n\r\nIn the centre is a large post of oak, framed together with braces under\r\nground, and walled fast to brick-work to make it steady. Round this\r\ncentre the whole frame is moved horizontally by means of 20 rollers,\r\n12 upon the outer, and 8 upon the inner wall. The vertical motion is\r\ngiven to the instrument by means of ropes and pullies, passing over the\r\nmain beam supported by the ladders. These ladders are 49 feet long,\r\nand there is a moveable gallery with 24 rollers to ease its motion.\r\nThere is a stair-case intended for persons who wish to ascend into the\r\ngallery, without being obliged to go up the ladder. The ease with which\r\nthe horizontal and vertical motions may be communicated to the tube\r\nmay be conceived, from a remark of Sir W. Herschel, that, in the year\r\n1789, he several times observed Saturn, two or three hours before and\r\nafter its meridian passage with one single person to continue, at his\r\ndirections, the necessary horizontal and vertical motions.\r\n\r\nBy this telescope the sixth and seventh satellites of Saturn were\r\ndiscovered, only one of which is within the reach of the 20 feet\r\nreflector, or even of a 25 feet instrument. The discovery of the\r\nsatellites of the planet Uranus, however, was made by the 20 feet\r\nreflector, but only after it had been converted from the Newtonian to\r\nthe Herschelian construction--which affords a proof of the superiority\r\nof the latter construction over the former when the same speculum is\r\nused. Never had the heavens before been observed with so extraordinary\r\nan instrument as the forty feet reflector. The nebulosities which\r\nare found among the fixed stars, in various regions of the heavens,\r\nappeared almost all to resolve themselves into an innumerable\r\nmultitude of stars; others, hitherto imperceptible, seemed to have\r\nacquired a distinct light. On the entrance of Sirius into the field\r\nof the telescope, the eye was so violently affected, that stars of\r\nless magnitude could not immediately after be perceived; and it was\r\nnecessary to wait for 20 minutes before these stars could be observed.\r\nThe ring of Saturn had always before ceased to be visible when its\r\nplane was directed towards the earth; but the feeble light which it\r\nreflects in that position was enough for Herschel’s instrument, and the\r\nring, even then, still remained visible to him.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally considered that this telescope was capable of\r\ncarrying a power of 6000 times; and perhaps for the purpose of an\r\nexperiment, and for trying its effect on certain objects, such a power\r\nmay have been applied,--in which case the eye-glass must have been\r\nonly 2/25 of an inch focal distance, or somewhat less than one twelfth\r\nof an inch. But such a power could not be generally applied, with any\r\ngood effect, to the planetary bodies; and I question much whether any\r\npower above 1000 times was ever generally used. For, it is the quantity\r\nof light which the telescope collects, more than the magnifying power,\r\nthat enables us to penetrate, with effect, into the distant spaces of\r\nthe firmament: and hence, as above stated, the power seldom exceeded\r\n200, which on account of the large diameter of the speculum, would\r\nenable the instrument to penetrate into the distant celestial spaces\r\nperhaps further than if a power of as many thousands of times had been\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nSir John Herschel, who inherits all the science, skill, and industry of\r\nhis father, some time ago ground and polished a new speculum for the 20\r\nfeet tube, formerly noticed, which is connected with a stand, pulleys\r\nand other appendages, similar to those above described, though of\r\nsmaller dimensions. This telescope shows the double stars exceedingly\r\nwell defined, and was one of the principal instruments used in forming\r\nhis catalogue of these objects which was presented to the Royal\r\nSociety, in conjunction with that of Sir James South, about the year\r\n1828. I suppose, it is likewise the same telescope with which Sir John\r\nlately made his Sidereal observations at the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 3.--RAMAGE’S LARGE REFLECTING TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThe largest _front view_ reflecting telescope in this country--next\r\nto Herschel’s 40 feet instrument--is that which was erected at the\r\nRoyal Observatory at Greenwich, in the year 1820, by Mr. Ramage of\r\nAberdeen. The diameter of the concave reflector is 15 inches, and its\r\nfocal length 25 feet. It is erected on machinery which bears a certain\r\nresemblance to that of Herschel’s, which we have now described; but the\r\nmechanical arrangements are greatly simplified, so that the instrument\r\nis manageable by an observer without an assistant. The tube is composed\r\nof a twelve-sided prism of deal 5/8 inch thick. At the mouth is a\r\ndouble cylinder of different diameters on the same axis; around this a\r\ncord is wound by a winch, and passes up from the small cylinder, over\r\na pulley, and down through another pulley on to the large cylinder.\r\nWhen the winch, therefore, is turned to raise the telescope, the\r\nendless cord is unwound from the smaller cylinder, and wound on to the\r\nlarger, the difference of the size of the two cylinders will be double\r\nthe quantity raised, and a mechanical force to any extent may thus be\r\nobtained, by duly proportioning the diameters of the two cylinders: by\r\nthis contrivance the necessity of an assistant is superseded. The view\r\nthrough this instrument first astonished those observers who had not\r\nbeen accustomed to examine a heavenly body with a telescope possessing\r\nso much light; and its performance was deemed quite extraordinary. But\r\nwhen the first impression had subsided, and different trials had been\r\nmade in different states of the atmosphere, it was discovered that the\r\ncentral portion of the speculum was more perfectly figured than the\r\nring bordering on the extreme edges. When the aperture was limited to\r\nten or twelve inches, the performance as to the distinctness in its\r\ndefining power, was greatly improved, and the light was so brilliant,\r\nthat the Astronomer Royal was disposed to entertain an opinion, that it\r\nmight equal that of a good achromatic refractor of the same dimensions.\r\nWhen, however, very small and obscure objects are to be observed,\r\nthe whole light of the entire aperture may be used with advantage on\r\nfavourable evenings.\r\n\r\nThe eye-pieces adapted to this telescope have powers which magnify\r\nthe object linearly from 100 to 1500 times, which are competent to\r\nfulfil all the purposes of vision when cleared of aberration. When the\r\ntelescope is placed in the plane of the meridian and elevated together\r\nwith the gallery, into any required altitude, the _meridional sweeps_,\r\nformerly practised by Sir W. Herschel, and continued by Sir John with\r\ngreat success, in the examination of double stars and nebula, may be\r\nmanaged with great ease.\r\n\r\nMr. Ramage had a telescope of about the same size, erected in an open\r\nspace in Aberdeen, which I had an opportunity of inspecting when I\r\npaid a visit to that gentleman in 1833; but cloudy weather prevented\r\nmy obtaining a view of any celestial bodies through it. He showed me\r\nat that time two or three large speculums, from 12 to 18 inches in\r\ndiameter, which he had finished some time before, and which appeared\r\nmost beautifully polished. He told me, too, that he had ground and\r\npolished them simply with his hand, without the aid of any machinery\r\nor mechanical power--a circumstance which, he said, astonished the\r\nopticians of London, when it was stated, and which they considered as\r\nalmost incredible. His experience in casting and polishing metals of\r\nvarious sizes, during a period of 15 or 16 years, qualified him to\r\nprepare specula of great lustre, and with an unusually high polish. It\r\nhas been asserted that a fifty feet telescope by Ramage of 21 inches\r\naperture was intended to be substituted for the 25 feet instrument\r\nerected at Greenwich, and the speculum it is understood, was prepared,\r\nand ready for use, provided the Navy Board was disposed to defray the\r\nexpense of carrying the plan into execution. But, unfortunately, this\r\ningenious artist was unexpectedly cut off in the midst of his career,\r\nabout the year 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 4.--THE AERIAL REFLECTOR--CONSTRUCTED BY THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\nA particular description of this telescope was given in the ‘Edinburgh\r\nNew Philosophical Journal’ for April--July, 1826, conducted by\r\nProfessor Jameson, the greater part of which was copied in the ‘London\r\nEncyclopedia,’ ] under the article _Telescope_. From this description I\r\nshall endeavour to condense a brief account of this instrument with a\r\nfew additional remarks.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1822, an old speculum 27 inches in focal length, very\r\nimperfectly polished happened accidentally to come into my possession;\r\nand feeling no inclination to fit it up in the Gregorian form, I formed\r\nthe resolution of throwing aside the small speculum, and attempting\r\nthe _front view_ notwithstanding the uniform assertion of opticians,\r\nthat such an attempt in instruments of a small size is impracticable.\r\nI had some ground for expecting success in this attempt, from several\r\nexperiments I had previously made, particularly from some modifications\r\nI had made in the construction of astronomical eye-pieces, which have\r\na tendency to correct the aberration of the rays of light, when they\r\nproceed somewhat obliquely from a lens or speculum. In the first\r\ninstance, I placed the speculum at the one end of a tube of the form\r\nof a segment of a cone--the end next the eye being somewhat wider\r\nthan that at which the speculum was fixed, and its length about an\r\ninch shorter than the focal distance of the mirror. A small tube for\r\nreceiving the different eye-pieces was fixed in the inside of the large\r\ntube at the end next the eye, and connected with an apparatus by which\r\nit could occasionally be moved either in a vertical or horizontal\r\ndirection. With the instrument fitted up in this manner, I obtained\r\nsome interesting views of the moon, and of terrestrial objects. But\r\nfinding that one side of the tube intercepted a considerable portion of\r\nlight from the object, I determined to throw aside the tube altogether,\r\nand to fit up the instrument on a different plan.\r\n\r\nA short mahogany tube, about 3 inches long, was prepared, to serve as\r\na socket for holding the speculum. To the side of this tube an arm was\r\nattached, about the length of the focal distance of the mirror, at\r\nthe extremity of which a brass tube for receiving the eye-pieces, was\r\nfixed, connected with screws and sockets, by which it might be raised\r\nor depressed, and turned to the right hand or to the left, and with\r\nadjusting apparatus by which it might be brought nearer to or farther\r\nfrom the speculum. Fig. 69 exhibits a general representation of the\r\ninstrument in profile. AB is the short tube which holds the speculum;\r\nCD the arm which carries the eye-tubes, which consists of two distinct\r\npieces of mahogany; the part D being capable of sliding along the under\r\nside of C, through the brass sockets EF. To the under part of the\r\nsocket F is attached a brass nut with a female screw, in which the male\r\nscrew _ab_ acts by applying the hand to the knob _c_, which serves for\r\nadjusting the instrument to distinct vision. G is the brass tube which\r\nreceives the eye-pieces. It is supported by a strong brass wire _de_,\r\nwhich passes through a nut connected with another strong wire, which\r\npasses through the arm D. By means of the nut _f_ this tube may be\r\nelevated or depressed, and firmly fixed in its proper position; and by\r\nthe nut _d_ it may be brought nearer to or further from, the arm D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 69._]\r\n\r\nBy the same apparatus, it is also rendered capable of being moved\r\neither in a vertical or horizontal direction: but when it is once\r\nadjusted to its proper position, it must be firmly fixed, and requires\r\nno further attention. The eye-piece represented in this figure is the\r\none used for terrestrial objects, which consists of the tubes belonging\r\nto a pocket achromatic telescope. When an astronomical eye-piece is\r\nused, the length of the instrument extends only to the point I. In\r\nlooking through this telescope, the right eye is applied at the point\r\nH, and the observer’s head is understood to be uncovered, or, at\r\nleast, tightly covered with a thin cap. For those who use only the\r\nleft eye, the arm would require to be placed on the opposite side of\r\nthe tube, or the arm, along with the tube, be made to turn round 180\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 70._]\r\n\r\nFig. 70 represents a front, or rather an oblique view of the\r\ninstrument, in which the position of the speculum may be seen. All the\r\nspecula which I fitted up in this form, having been originally intended\r\nfor Gregorian reflectors, have holes in their centres. The eye-piece\r\nis therefore directed to a point nearly equi-distant from the hole to\r\nthe left hand edge of the speculum, that is, to the point _a_. In one\r\nof these instruments fitted up with a four feet speculum, the line\r\nof vision is directed to the point _b_ on the opposite side of the\r\nspeculum, but, in this case, the eye-tube is removed farther from the\r\narm, than in the former case. The hole in the centre of the speculum is\r\nobviously a defect in this construction of a reflecting telescope, as\r\nit prevents us from obtaining the full advantage of the rays which fall\r\nnear the centre of the mirror; yet the performance of the instruments,\r\neven with this disadvantage, is superior to what we should previously\r\nhave been led to expect.\r\n\r\nThe principal nicety in the construction of this instrument, consists\r\nin the adjustment and proper direction of the eye-tube. There is only\r\none position in which vision will be perfectly distinct. It must be\r\nneither too high nor too low,--it must be fixed at a certain distance\r\nfrom the arm,--and must be directed to a certain point of the speculum.\r\nThis position must be ultimately determined by experiment, when viewing\r\nterrestrial objects. A person unacquainted with this construction\r\nof the telescope, would, perhaps, find it difficult, in the first\r\ninstance, to make this adjustment; but were it at any time deranged,\r\nthrough accident or otherwise, I can easily make the adjustment anew,\r\nin the course of a minute or two.\r\n\r\nIn pointing this telescope to the object intended to be viewed, the\r\neye is applied at K, fig, 69, and looking along the arm, towards the\r\neye-piece, till it nearly coincide with the object, it will, in most\r\ncases, be readily found. In this way I can easily point this instrument\r\nto Jupiter or Saturn, or to any of the other planets, visible to the\r\nnaked eye, even when a power of 160 or 170 times is applied. When high\r\nmagnifying powers, however, are used, it may be expedient to fix,\r\non the upper part of the short tube in which the speculum rests, a\r\nFinder, such as that which is used in Newtonian telescopes. When the\r\nmoon is the object intended to be viewed, she may be instantly found by\r\nmoving the instrument till her reflected image be seen from the eye-end\r\nof the telescope on the face of the mirror.\r\n\r\nI have fitted up several instruments of the above description with\r\nspecula of 16, 27, 35, and 49 inches focal distance. One of these\r\nhaving a speculum of 27 inches focal length, and an astronomical\r\neye-piece, producing a magnifying power of about 90 times, serves\r\nas a good astronomical telescope. By this instrument the belts\r\nand satellites of Jupiter, the ring of Saturn, and the mountains\r\nand cavities of the moon, may be contemplated with great ease and\r\ndistinctness. With a magnifying power of 35 or 40 times, terrestrial\r\nobjects appear remarkably bright and well-defined. When compared with\r\na Gregorian, the quantity of light upon the object appears nearly\r\ndoubled, and the image is equally distinct--although the speculum has\r\nseveral blemishes, and its surface is but imperfectly polished. It\r\nrepresents objects in their natural colours, without that dingy and\r\nyellowish tinge which appears when looking through a Gregorian. Another\r\nof these instruments is about four feet long. The speculum which\r\nbelongs to it is a very old one: when it came into my possession, it\r\nwas so completely tarnished, as scarcely to reflect a ray of light.\r\nAfter it was cleaned, it appeared to be scarcely half polished, and\r\nits surface is covered with yellowish stains which cannot be erased.\r\nWere it fitted up upon the Gregorian plan, it would, I presume, be\r\nof very little use, unless when a very small magnifying power was\r\napplied. Yet, in its present form, it bears, with distinctness, a\r\nmagnifying power of 130 times, and is equal in its performance to a\r\n3-1/2 feet achromatic. It exhibits distinct and interesting views of\r\nthe diversities of shade, and of the mountains, vales, cavities, and\r\nother inequalities of the moon’s surface. With a power of about 50\r\ntimes, and a terrestrial eye-piece, it forms an excellent telescope\r\nfor land objects, and exhibits them in a brilliant and novel aspect.\r\nThe smallest instrument I have attempted to construct on this plan,\r\nis only 5-1/2 inches focal distance, and 1-3/4 inch diameter. With a\r\nmagnifying power of about 15 times, it shows terrestrial objects with\r\ndistinctness and brilliancy. But I should deem it inexpedient to fit\r\nup any instrument of this description with specula of a shorter focal\r\ndistance than 20 or 24 inches. The longer the focal distance the more\r\ndistinctness may be expected, although the aperture of the speculum\r\nshould be comparatively small.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the properties and advantages peculiar to\r\nthis construction of the reflecting telescope.\r\n\r\n1. It is _extremely simple_, and may be fitted up at a comparatively\r\n_small expense_. Instead of large and expensive brass tubes, such as\r\nare used in the Gregorian and Newtonian construction, little more is\r\nrequired than a short mahogany tube, two or three inches long, to\r\nserve as a socket for the speculum, with an arm connected with it\r\nabout the focal length of the speculum. The expense of small specula,\r\neither plain or concave, is saved, together with the numerous screws,\r\nsprings, &c., for centering the two specula, and placing the small\r\nmirror parallel to the large one. The only adjustment requisite in this\r\nconstruction, is that of the eye-tube to the speculum; and, by means of\r\nthe simple apparatus above described, it can be effected in the course\r\nof a few minutes. Almost the whole expense of the instrument consists\r\nin the price of the speculum and the eye-pieces. The expense of fitting\r\nup the four feet speculum, alluded to above--_exclusive of speculum and\r\neye-piece_--but including mahogany tube and arm, brass sockets, screws,\r\neye-tube, brass joint, and a cast-iron stand painted and varnished,\r\ndid not amount to £1 : 8_s_. A Gregorian of the same size would have\r\nrequired a brass tube at least 4-1/2 feet in length, which would cost 5\r\nor 6 guineas, besides the apparatus connected with the small speculum,\r\nand the additional expense connected with the fitting up of the joint\r\nand stand requisite for supporting and steadying so unwieldy an\r\ninstrument. While the one instrument would require two persons to carry\r\nit from one room to another, and would occupy a considerable space in\r\nan ordinary apartment, the other can be moved, with the utmost ease,\r\nwith one hand, to any moderate distance, and the space it occupies is\r\nextremely small.\r\n\r\n2. _It is more convenient for viewing celestial objects at a high\r\naltitude, than other telescopes._ When we look through a Gregorian\r\nreflector or an achromatic telescope of 4 or 5 feet in length, to an\r\nobject elevated 50 or 60 degrees above the horizon, the body requires\r\nto be placed in an uneasy and distorted position, and the eye is\r\nsomewhat strained, while the observation is continued. But when\r\nviewing similar objects by the _Aerial Reflector_, we can either stand\r\nperfectly erect, or sit on a chair, with the same ease as we sit at a\r\ndesk when reading a book or writing a letter. In this way, the surface\r\nof the moon or any of the planets, may be contemplated for an hour or\r\ntwo, without the least weariness or fatigue. A delineation of the\r\nlunar surface may be taken with this instrument with more ease and\r\naccuracy than with any other instrument, as the observer can sketch\r\nthe outline of the object by one eye on a tablet placed a little below\r\nthe eye-piece, while the other eye is looking at the object. For the\r\npurpose of accommodating the instrument to a sitting or standing\r\nposture a small table was constructed, capable of being elevated or\r\ndepressed at pleasure, on which the stand of the telescope is placed.\r\nWhen the telescope is 4 or 5 feet long, and the object at a very high\r\nelevation, the instrument may be placed on the floor of the apartment,\r\nand the observer will stand in an erect position.\r\n\r\n3. This instrument is considerably _shorter_ than a Gregorian telescope\r\nwhose mirror is of the same focal length. When an astronomical\r\neye-piece is used, the whole length of the instrument is nothing more\r\nthan the focal length of the speculum. But a Gregorian whose large\r\nspeculum is 4 feet focus, will be nearly 5 feet in length, including\r\nthe eye-piece.\r\n\r\n4. The Aerial Reflector far excels the Gregorian in brightness. The\r\ndeficiency of light in the Gregorians is owing to the second reflection\r\nfrom the small mirror; for it has been proved by experiment that nearly\r\nthe one half of the rays of light which fall upon a reflecting surface\r\nis lost by a second reflection. The image of the object may also be\r\npresumed to be more correct, as it is not liable to any distortion by\r\nbeing reflected from another speculum.\r\n\r\n5. There is _less tremor_ in these telescopes than in Gregorian\r\nReflectors. One cause, among others, of the tremors complained of in\r\nGregorians is, I presume, the formation of a second image at a great\r\ndistance from the first, besides that which arises from the elastic\r\ntremor of the small speculum, when carried by an arm supported only\r\nat one end. But as the image formed by the speculum in the aerial\r\ntelescope is viewed _directly_, without being exposed to any subsequent\r\nreflection, it is not so liable to the tremors which are so frequently\r\nexperienced in other reflectors. Notwithstanding the length of the arm\r\nof the 4 feet telescope above mentioned, a celestial object appears\r\nremarkably steady, when passing across the field of view, especially\r\nwhen it is at a moderate degree of altitude; and it is easily kept in\r\nthe field by a gentle motion applied to the arm of the instrument.\r\n\r\nIn prosecuting my experiments in relation to these instruments, I\r\nwished to ascertain what effect might be produced by using a _part of\r\na speculum_ instead of the whole. For this purpose, I cut a speculum,\r\nthree feet in focal length, through the centre, so as to divide it\r\ninto two equal parts, and fitted up each part as a distinct telescope;\r\nso that I obtained two telescopes from one speculum. In this case I\r\nfound that each half of the speculum performed nearly as well as the\r\nwhole speculum had done before, at least there appeared to be _no\r\nvery sensible_ diminution in the _brightness_ of the object, when\r\nviewed with a moderate power, and the image was equally accurate and\r\ndistinct; so that if _economy_ were a particular object aimed at in\r\nthe construction of these instruments, two good telescopes might be\r\nobtained from one speculum; or if a speculum happened to be broken\r\naccidentally into large fragments, one or more of the fragments might\r\nbe fitted up on this principle to serve as a tolerably good telescope.\r\n\r\nFrom the experiments I have made in reference to these instruments, it\r\nis demonstrable, that _a tube is not necessary_ in the construction of\r\na reflecting telescope--at least on the principle now stated--whether\r\nit be used by day or by night for terrestrial or celestial objects;\r\nfor I have frequently used these telescopes in the open air in the day\r\ntime, without any inconvenience from extraneous light. Therefore, were\r\na reflecting telescope of 50 or 60 feet in length to be constructed, it\r\nmight be fitted up at a comparatively small expence, after the expense\r\nof the metallic substances, and of casting, grinding, and polishing\r\nthe speculum is defrayed. The largest instrument of this description\r\nwhich has hitherto been constructed is the 40 feet reflector of Sir\r\nW. Herschel. This complicated and most unwieldy instrument had a tube\r\nof rolled or sheet iron 39 feet 4 inches in length, about 15 feet in\r\ncircumference, and weighed about 8000 pounds. Now, I conceive that\r\nsuch enormous tubes, in instruments of such dimensions, are altogether\r\nunnecessary. Nothing more is requisite than a short tube for holding\r\nthe speculum. Connected with one side of this tube (or with both sides\r\nwere it found necessary), two strong bars of wood, projecting a few\r\nfeet beyond the speculum end, and extending in front as far as the\r\nfocal length of the mirror, and connected by cross bars of wood, iron\r\nor brass--would be quite sufficient for a support to the eye-piece, and\r\nfor directing the motion of the instrument. A telescope of 40 or 50\r\nfeet in length, constructed on this plan, would not require one fifth\r\nof the expense, nor one fourth of the apparatus and mechanical power\r\nfor moving it to any required position, which were found necessary\r\nin the construction of Sir W. Herschel’s large reflecting telescope.\r\nThe idea here suggested will perhaps be more readily appreciated by\r\nan inspection of fig. 71, where A is the short tube, BC and DE the\r\ntwo large bars or arms, connected with cross bars, for the purpose of\r\nsecuring strength and steadiness. At I and K, behind the speculum,\r\nweights might be applied, if necessary, for counterbalancing the lever\r\npower of the long arm. F represents the position of the eye-piece,\r\nand GH the joint and part of the pedestal on which the instrument is\r\nplaced. With regard to telescopes of smaller dimensions, as from 5\r\nto 15 feet in focal length--with the exception of the expense of the\r\nspecula and eye-pieces--they might be fitted up for a sum not greater\r\nthan from 3 to 10 or 15 guineas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 71._]\r\n\r\nWere any person to attempt the construction of those telescopes, it\r\nis possible he might not succeed in his first attempts without more\r\nminute directions than I have yet given. The following directions\r\nmay perhaps tend to guide the experimenter in adjusting the eye-tube\r\nto the speculum, which is a point that requires to be particularly\r\nattended to, and on which depends the accurate performance of the\r\ninstrument. After having fixed the eye-piece nearly in the position\r\nit should occupy, and directed the instrument to a particular object,\r\nlook along the arm of the telescope, from K (fig. 69.) to the extremity\r\nof the eye-piece at H, and observe, whether it nearly coincides with\r\nthe object. If the object appear lower than this line of vision, the\r\neye-piece must be lowered, and if higher, it must be raised, by means\r\nof the nuts and screws at _gd_ and _fe_, till the object and the line\r\nof vision now stated nearly coincide. The eye-piece should be directed\r\nas nearly perpendicular to the front of the speculum as possible, but\r\nso that the reflected image of one’s head from the mirror shall not\r\ninterfere to obstruct the rays from the object. An object may be seen\r\nwith an approximate degree of distinctness, but not accurately, unless\r\nthis adjustment be pretty accurately made. The astronomical eye-pieces\r\nused for these telescopes are fitted with a brass cap which slides on\r\nthe end next the eye, and is capable of being brought nearer to or\r\nfarther from the first eye-glass. In the centre of this cap, next the\r\neye, is a small hole, about the 1/40th or 1/50th of an inch diameter,\r\nor about as wide as to admit the point of a pin or a moderate-sized\r\nneedle. The distance of this hole from the lens next the eye must be\r\nadjusted by trial, till the whole field of view appear distinct. A\r\ncommon astronomical eye-piece, without this addition, does not answer\r\nwell. I find by experience, that terrestrial eye-pieces, such as those\r\nused in good achromatic telescopes, are, on the whole, best adapted to\r\nthis construction of a reflecting telescope.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes used these instruments for the purpose of viewing\r\nperspective prints, which they exhibit in a beautiful and interesting\r\nmanner. If a coloured perspective be placed at one end of a large\r\nroom or gallery, and strongly illuminated either by the sun or by two\r\ncandles, and one of the reflectors furnished with a _small magnifying\r\npower_, placed at the opposite end of the room--the representation of\r\na street or a landscape will be seen in its true perspective, and will\r\nappear even more pleasant and interesting than when viewed through\r\nthe common _optical diagonal machine_. If an inverting eye-piece be\r\nused--which is most eligible in this experiment--the print, of course,\r\nmust be placed in an inverted position.\r\n\r\nThat reflecting telescopes of the descriptions now stated are original\r\nin their construction, appears from the uniform language of optical\r\nwriters, some of whom have pronounced such attempts to be altogether\r\nimpracticable. Sir David Brewster, one of the latest and most\r\nrespectable writers on this subject, in the ‘Edinburgh Encyclopedia’\r\nart _optics_, and in the last edition of his _appendix_ to ‘Ferguson’s\r\nLectures,’ has the following remarks:--‘If we could dispense with\r\nthe use of the small specula in telescopes of moderate length, by\r\ninclining the great speculum, and using an oblique, and consequently\r\na _distorted_ reflection, as proposed first by La Maire, we should\r\nconsider the Newtonian telescope as perfect; and on a large scale, or\r\nwhen the instrument exceeds 20 feet, it has undoubtedly this character,\r\nas nothing can be more simple than to magnify, by a single eye-glass,\r\nthe image formed by a single speculum. As the _front view is quite\r\nimpracticable_, and indeed _has never been attempted_ in instruments\r\nof a small size, it becomes of great practicable consequence to remove\r\nas much as possible, the evils which arise from the use of a small\r\nspeculum,’ &c.\r\n\r\nThe instruments now described have effectuated, in some degree, the\r\ndesirable object alluded to by this distinguished philosopher, and\r\nthe mode of construction is neither that of Sir W. Herschel’s front\r\nview, nor does it coincide with that proposed by La Maire, which\r\nappears to have been a mere hint that was never realized in the\r\nconstruction of reflecting telescopes of a small size. The simplicity\r\nof the construction of these instruments, and the excellence of their\r\nperformance, have been much admired by several scientific gentlemen and\r\nothers to whom they have been exhibited. Prior to the description of\r\nthem in the Edin. Philos. Journal, they were exhibited in the Calton\r\nHill Observatory, Edinburgh, in the presence of Professor Wallace,\r\nand another gentleman, who compared their performance with that of an\r\nexcellent Gregorian. As this instrument is distinguished from every\r\nother telescope, in being used without a tube, it has been denominated\r\n‘_The aerial reflector_.’\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 4.--EARL OF ROSSE’S REFLECTING TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nThis nobleman, unlike many of his compeers, has, for a considerable\r\nnumber of years past, devoted his attention to the pursuits of science,\r\nand particularly to the improvement of reflecting telescopes. He is\r\nevidently possessed of high mathematical attainments, combined with\r\nan uncommon degree of mechanical ingenuity. About 14 or 15 years ago,\r\nhe engaged in various experiments with the view of counteracting the\r\neffects of the spherical aberration of the specula of reflecting\r\ntelescopes--which imperfection, if it could be completely remedied,\r\nwould render the reflecting telescope almost a perfect instrument,\r\nas it is not affected by the different refrangibility of the rays of\r\nlight. His method, we believe, consisted in forming a large speculum of\r\ntwo or three separate pieces of metal, which were afterwards accurately\r\ncombined into one--a central part which was surrounded by one or two\r\nrings ground on the same tool. When the images formed by the separate\r\npieces, were made exactly to coincide, the image of the object towards\r\nwhich the whole speculum was directed, was then found to be as distinct\r\nas either image had been when separate. But at the period referred to,\r\na sufficient number of experiments had not been made to determine that\r\nhis lordship had completely accomplished the object he intended.\r\n\r\nGreat interest, however, has of late been excited by the improvements\r\nwhich his lordship has made in the formation of specula. Sir W.\r\nHerschel never made public the means by which he succeeded in giving\r\nsuch gigantic developement to the reflecting telescope: and therefore\r\nthe construction of a _large_ reflector has been considered as a\r\nperilous adventure. But, according to a report of Dr. Robinson of\r\nArmagh, to the Irish academy, the Earl of Rosse has overcome the\r\ndifficulties which have hitherto been met with, and carried to an\r\nextent which even Herschel himself did not venture to contemplate,\r\nthe illuminating power of this telescope, along with a sharpness\r\nof definition little inferior to that of the achromatic; and it is\r\nscarcely possible, he observes, to preserve the necessary sobriety of\r\nlanguage in speaking of the moon’s appearance with this instrument,\r\nwhich Dr. Robinson believes to be the most powerful ever constructed.\r\nThe difficulty of constructing large specula, and of imparting to them\r\nthe requisite degree of polish, has hitherto been considered so great,\r\nthat from 8 to 12 inches diameter has been in general their utmost\r\nsize. Indeed, except with the greatest reluctance, London opticians\r\nwould not accept of orders for specula of more than 9 inches in\r\ndiameter. It appears, however, that the Earl of Rosse has succeeded,\r\nby a peculiar method of moulding, in casting object-mirrors of true\r\n_speculum metal of three feet in diameter, and of a weight exceeding\r\n17 cwt_. He is about to construct a telescope, the speculum of which\r\nis _six feet_ in diameter, _fifty feet focal distance_, and of the\r\nweight of _four tons_; and from what he has already accomplished, it\r\nis not doubted that he possesses the power to carry his design into\r\neffect. These great masses of metal, which, in the hands of all other\r\nmakers of specula would have been as untractable as so much unannealed\r\nflint-glass, the Earl of Rosse has further succeeded in bringing to\r\nthe highest degree of polish, and the utmost perfection of curvature\r\nby means of machinery. The process is conducted under water, by which\r\nmeans those variations of temperature, so fatal to the finest specula\r\nhitherto attempted, are effectually guarded against. To convince Dr.\r\nRobinson of the efficacy of this machinery, the earl took the three\r\nfeet speculum out of its telescope, destroyed its polished surface,\r\nand placed it under the mechanical polisher. In six hours it was\r\ntaken out with a perfect new surface as bright as the original. Under\r\nthe old system of hand-polishing, it might have required months,\r\nand even years, to effect this restoration. Even before achieving\r\nthese extraordinary triumphs on the solid substance, his lordship\r\nhad constructed a six feet reflector by covering a curved surface of\r\nbrass with squares of the true _speculum metal_, which gave an immense\r\nquantity of light, though subject to some irregularities, arising\r\nfrom the number of joinings necessary in such a mosaic work. Of the\r\nperformance of his lordship’s great telescope, mounted with this\r\nreflector, those who have seen it speak in terms of high admiration;\r\nbut in reference to the smaller and more perfect instrument, furnished\r\nwith the solid three feet speculum, the language of the Armagh\r\nastronomer assumes a tone of enthusiasm and even of sublimity. By means\r\nof this exquisite instrument, Dr. Robinson and Sir J. South, in the\r\nintervals of a rather unfavourable night, saw several new stars, and\r\ncorrected numerous errors of other observers. For example, the planet\r\nUranus, supposed to possess a ring similar to that of Saturn, was found\r\nnot to have any such appendage; and those nebulæ, hitherto regarded,\r\nfrom their apparently circular outline, as ‘coalescing systems,’\r\nappeared, when tested by the three feet speculum, to be very far\r\nindeed from presenting a globular appearance; numerous off-shoots and\r\nappendages, invisible by other telescopes, appearing in all directions\r\nradiating from their edges. Such discoveries, which reflect great\r\nhonour on the Earl of Rosse, will doubtless have great effect on the\r\ninterests of astronomical science.[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 5.--REFLECTING TELESCOPES WITH GLASS SPECULA.\r\n\r\nAfter making a variety of experiments with aerial telescopes\r\nconstructed of metallic specula of different focal lengths, I\r\nconstructed a telescope on the same plan, with a concave glass mirror.\r\nHaving obtained a fragment of a very large convex mirror which happened\r\naccidentally to have been broken, I caused the convex side to be\r\nfoliated, or silverised, and found its focal length to be about 27\r\ninches. This mirror, which was about 5 inches diameter, I placed in one\r\nof the aerial reflectors, instead of the metallic speculum, and tried\r\nits effects with different terrestrial eye-pieces. With a power of\r\nabout 35 or 40 times, it gave a beautiful and splendid view of distant\r\nterrestrial objects--the quantity of light reflected from them, being\r\nconsiderably greater than when a metallic speculum was used, and they\r\nappeared on the whole well-defined. The only imperfection--as I had\r\nforeseen--consisted in a double image being formed of objects which\r\nwere remarkably bright and white, such as a light-house whitened on\r\nthe outside, and strongly illuminated by the sun. One of the images\r\nwas bright and the other faint. This was obviously owing to the two\r\nreflections from the two surfaces of the mirror--one from the convex\r\nsilverised side, and the other from the concave side next the eye,\r\nwhich produced the faint image--which circumstance has been generally\r\nconsidered as a sufficient reason for rejecting the use of glass\r\nspecula in telescopes. But although very bright objects exhibited\r\na double image, almost all the other objects in the terrestrial\r\nlandscape appeared quite distinct and without any secondary image, so\r\nthat a common observer could scarcely have noticed any imperfection.\r\nWhen the instrument, however, was directed to celestial objects, the\r\nsecondary image was somewhat vivid, so that every object appeared\r\ndouble. Jupiter appeared with two bodies, at a little distance from\r\neach other, and his four satellites appeared increased to eight.\r\nThe moon likewise appeared as a double orb, but the principal image\r\nwas distinct and well-defined. Such a telescope, therefore, was not\r\nwell-adapted for celestial observations, but might answer well enough\r\nfor viewing terrestrial objects.\r\n\r\nConsidering that the injurious effects of the secondary image arose\r\nfrom the images reflected from the two surfaces being formed near the\r\nsame point, and at nearly the same focal distance, I formed a plan for\r\ndestroying the secondary image, or at least counteracting its effects,\r\nby forming the concavity of the mirror next the eye of a portion of a\r\nsphere _different_ from that of the convex side which was silverised,\r\nand from which the principal image is formed. But, for a long time, I\r\ncould find no opticians possessed of tools of a sufficient length of\r\nradii for accomplishing my design. At length a London working optician\r\nundertook to finish a glass speculum, according to my directions,\r\nwhich were, that the convex surface of the mirror should be ground on\r\na tool which would produce a focal distance by reflection of about 4\r\nfeet; and that the concave surface should have its focal distance at\r\nabout 3 feet 3 inches, so that the secondary image might be formed\r\nat about 9 inches, within the focal distance of the silverised side,\r\nand not interfere to disturb the principal image. But, either from\r\nignorance or inattention, the artist mistook the radius for the half\r\nradius of concavity, and the speculum turned out to be only 23 inches\r\nfocal distance by reflection. This mirror was fitted up as a telescope,\r\non the aerial plan, and I found, as I expected, the secondary image\r\ncompletely destroyed. It produced a very beautiful and brilliant view\r\nof land objects, and even the brightest objects exhibited no double\r\nimage. The mirror was nearly 5 inches in diameter, but the image was\r\nmost accurately defined when the aperture was contracted to about 3\r\ninches. It was fitted with a terrestrial eye-piece which produced a\r\nmagnifying power of about 25 times. When directed to the moon, it\r\ngave a very distinct and luminous view of that orb, without the least\r\nappearance of a secondary image. But as the focal distance of the\r\nspeculum was scarcely half the length I had prescribed, I did not\r\napply to it any high astronomical powers; as I find, that these can\r\nonly be applied with effect, in this construction, to a speculum of a\r\nconsiderable focal length. Happening to have at hand a convex lens 10\r\nfeet focal length, and 4 inches in diameter--the one side of which had\r\nbeen ground to a certain degree of concavity--I caused the convex side\r\nto be foliated, which produced a focus by reflection, at 13-1/2 inches\r\ndistant. To this mirror I applied terrestrial powers of 15 and 24, with\r\nconsiderable distinctness. The power of 15 produced a very brilliant\r\nand distinct view of land objects. Had the mirror been at least 3 times\r\nthe focal length, it would have formed an excellent telescope, with the\r\nsame aperture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 6.--A REFLECTING TELESCOPE, WITH A SINGLE MIRROR AND NO EYE-PIECE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 72._]\r\n\r\nOn the same principle as that by which a refracting telescope may be\r\nconstructed by means of a single lens--as represented fig. 51, (page\r\n234) we may form a telescope by reflection with a single mirror, and\r\nwithout an eye-piece. Let AB, fig. 72, represent a large concave\r\nspeculum, and C its focus--if an eye be placed at D, about 8 or 10\r\ninches within the focal point C, all the objects in the direction of C,\r\nor behind the spectator, will be seen magnified by reflection on the\r\nface of the mirror, and strongly illuminated. The magnifying power, in\r\nthis case, will be nearly in the proportion of the focal length of the\r\nmirror to the focal length of the eye for near objects. If for example,\r\nthe focal distance of the mirror be 8 feet, and the distance from the\r\neye at which we see near objects most distinctly, be 8 inches--the\r\nmagnifying power will be in the ratio of 8 to 96, or 12 times. I have\r\na glass mirror of this description, whose focal length is 4 feet 8\r\ninches, and diameter 6 inches, which magnifies distant objects about 7\r\ntimes, takes in a large field of view, and exhibits objects with great\r\nbrilliancy. It presents a very distinct picture of the moon, showing\r\nthe different streaks of light and shade upon her surface; and, in some\r\ncases, shows the larger spots which traverse the solar disc. This mode\r\nof viewing objects is extremely easy and pleasant, especially when the\r\nmirror is of a large diameter; and the observer is at first struck and\r\ngratified with the novel aspect in which the objects appear.\r\n\r\nWere a concave mirror of this description--whether of glass or of\r\nspeculum metal--to be formed to a very long focus, the magnifying\r\npower would be considerable. One of 50 feet focal length, and of a\r\ncorresponding diameter, might produce a magnifying power, to certain\r\neyes, of about 75 times; and, from the quantity of light with which the\r\nobject would be seen, its effect would be much greater than the same\r\npower applied to a common telescope. Sir W. Herschel states, that, on\r\none occasion, by looking with his naked eye on the speculum of his 40\r\nfeet Reflector, without the interposition of any lens or mirror, he\r\nperceived distinctly one of the satellites of Saturn, which requires\r\nthe application of a considerable power to be seen by an ordinary\r\ntelescope. Such an instrument is one of the most simple forms of a\r\ntelescope, and would exhibit a brilliant and interesting view of the\r\nmoon, or of terrestrial objects.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES OF REFLECTING TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\n1.

The different kinds of eye-pieces may be\r\narranged into two general divisions--_Astronomical_ and _terrestrial_.\r\n\r\n1. _Astronomical eye-pieces._--The most simple astronomical eye-piece\r\nis that which consists of a single convex lens; and when the focal\r\ndistance of this lens, and that of the object-glass of the instrument\r\nis accurately ascertained, the magnifying power may be nicely\r\ndetermined, by dividing the focal length of the object-lens by that\r\nof the eye-glass. But, as the pencil of white light transmitted by\r\nthe object-glass, will be divided by the eye-glass into its component\r\ncolours, the object will appear bordered with coloured fringes, and the\r\ndistinctness of vision consequently injured. Besides, the spherical\r\naberration, when a single lens is used, is much greater than when two\r\nor more glasses are employed. Hence astronomical eye-pieces are now\r\nformed by a combination of at least two lenses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 73._]\r\n\r\nThe combination of lenses now generally used for astronomical purposes,\r\nis that which is usually denominated the _Huygenian eye-piece_, having\r\nbeen first proposed by the celebrated Huygens, as a great improvement\r\non the single lens eye-piece. The following figure (73) represents a\r\nsection of this eye-piece. Let AB be a compounded pencil of white light\r\nproceeding from the object-glass; BF a plano-convex field-glass, with\r\nits plane side next the eye-glass E. The red rays of the pencil AB,\r\nafter refraction would cross the axis in R, and the violet rays in V,\r\nbut meeting the eye-glass E, the red rays will be refracted to O, and\r\nthe violet nearly in the same direction, when they will cross each\r\nother about the point O, in the axis, and unite. The distance of the\r\ntwo glasses FE, to produce this correction, when made of crown glass,\r\nmust be equal to half the sum of their focal distances nearly. For\r\nexample, suppose the focal distance of the largest, or field lens, to\r\nbe 3 inches, and the focal distance of the lens next the eye, 1 inch,\r\nthe two lenses should be placed exactly at the distance of 2 inches;\r\nthe sum of their focal length being 4, the half of which is 2. In other\r\nwords, the glass next the eye should be placed as much _within_ the\r\nfocus of the field-glass as is equal to its own focal distance. The\r\nfocal length of a single lens, that has the same magnifying power as\r\nthis compound eye-piece--is equal to twice the product of the focal\r\nlengths of the two lenses, divided by the sum of the same numbers.\r\nOr, it is equal to half the focal length of the field-glass. Thus, in\r\nreference to the preceding example, twice the product of the focal\r\nlength of the two lenses--is equal to 6, and their sum is 4. The former\r\nnumber divided by the latter, produces a quotient of 1-1/2, which\r\nis the focal length of a single lens, which would produce the same\r\nmagnifying power as the eye-piece; and 1½ is just half the focal length\r\nof the field-glass. The proportion of the focal lengths of the two\r\nlenses to each other, according to Huygens, should be as 3 to 1; that\r\nis, if the field-glass be 4-1/2 inches, the eye-glass should be 1-1/2;\r\nand this is the proportion most generally adopted. But some opticians\r\nhave recommended that the proportions should be as 3 to 2. Boscovich\r\nrecommended two similar lenses; and in this case the distance between\r\nthem was equal to half the sum of their focal distances, as in the\r\nHuygenian eye-piece.\r\n\r\nThe image is formed at IM, at the focal distance of the lens next the\r\neye, and at the same distance from the field-glass. When distinct\r\nvision is the principal object of an achromatic telescope, the two\r\nlenses are usually both plano-convex, and fixed with their curved\r\nfaces towards the object glass, as in the figure. Sometimes, however,\r\nthey consist of what is called _crossed_ lenses, that is lenses ground\r\non one side to a short focus, and on the other side to a pretty\r\nlong focus, the sides with the deepest curves being turned towards\r\nthe object glass. A diaphragm, or aperture of a proper diameter, is\r\nplaced at the focus of the eye lens, where the image formed by the\r\nobject-glass falls, for the purpose of cutting off the extreme rays of\r\nthe field lens, and rendering every part of the field of view equally\r\ndistinct. This is likewise the form of the eye-piece generally applied\r\nto Gregorian reflectors. In short, when accurately constructed, it is\r\napplicable to telescopes of every description. This eye-piece, having\r\nthe image viewed, by the eye behind the inner lens, is generally called\r\nthe _negative_ eye-piece, and is that which the optical-instrument\r\nmakers usually supply, of three or four different sizes, for so many\r\nmagnifying powers, to be applied to different celestial objects,\r\naccording to their nature or the state of the atmosphere in which they\r\nare used.\r\n\r\n_Ramsden’s eye-piece._--There is another modification of lenses,\r\nknown by the name of the _Positive_, or Ramsden’s eye-piece, which is\r\nmuch used in Transit instruments, and telescopes which are furnished\r\nwith micrometers, and which affords equally good vision as the other\r\neye-piece. In this construction the lenses are plano-convex, and\r\nnearly of the same focus, but are placed at a distance from each other\r\nless than the focal distance of the glass next the eye, so that the\r\nimage of the object viewed is beyond both the lenses, when measuring\r\nfrom the eye. The flat faces of the two lenses are turned into\r\ncontrary directions in this eye-piece--one facing the object-glass,\r\nand the other the eye of the observer; and as the image formed at\r\nthe focus of the object-glass, lies parallel to the flat face of the\r\ncontiguous lens, every part of the field of view is distinct at the\r\nsame adjustment, or, as opticians say, there is a _flat field_, which,\r\nwithout a diaphragm, prevents distortion of the object. This eye-piece\r\nis represented in fig. 74, where AB and CD are two plano-convex\r\nlenses, with their convex sides inwards. They have nearly the same\r\nfocal length, and are placed at a distance from each other, equal to\r\nabout two thirds of the focal length of either. The focal length of\r\nan equivalent single lens is equal to three fourths the focal length\r\nof either lens, supposing them to have equal focal distances. This\r\neye-piece is generally applied, when wires of spider’s lines are used\r\nin the common focus; as the piece containing the lenses can be taken\r\nout without disturbing the lines, and is adjustable for distinct\r\nvision; and whatever may be the measure of any object given by the\r\nwire micrometer, at the solar focus, it is not altered by a change of\r\nthe magnifying power, when a second eye-piece of this construction is\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 74._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 75._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 76._]\r\n\r\n_Aberration of lenses._--In connection with the above descriptions,\r\nthe following statements respecting the spherical aberration of lenses\r\nmay not be inappropriate. Mr. John Dollond, in a letter to Mr. Short,\r\nremarks, that ‘the aberration in a single lens is as the cube of the\r\nrefracted angle; but if the refraction be caused by two lenses, the sum\r\nof the cubes of each half will be 1/4 of the refracted angle, twice\r\nthe cube of 1 being 1/4 the cube of 2. So three times the cube of 1 is\r\nonly _one ninth_ of the cube of 3.’ &c. Hence the indistinctness of the\r\nborders of the field of view of a telescope is diminished by increasing\r\nthe number of lenses in an eye piece. Sir J. Herschel has shown that if\r\ntwo plano-convex lenses are put together as in fig. 75, the aberration\r\nwill be only 0.2481, or _one fourth_ of that of a single lens in its\r\nbest form. The focal length of the first of these lenses, must be to\r\nthat of the second as 1 to 2.3. If their focal lengths are equal, the\r\naberration will be 0.603, or nearly one half. The spherical aberration,\r\nhowever, may be _entirely_ destroyed by combining a meniscus and double\r\nconvex lens, as shown in fig. 76, the convex sides being turned to the\r\neye when they are used as lenses, and to parallel rays, when they are\r\nused as burning glasses. Sir J. Herschel has computed the following\r\ncurvatures for such lenses.\r\n\r\n  _Focal length of the convex lens_    +10.000\r\n  Radius of its first surface           +5.833\r\n  Radius of its second surface         -35.000\r\n  _Focal length of the meniscus_       +17.829\r\n  Radius of its first surface           +3.688\r\n  Radius of its second surface          +6.294\r\n  Focal length of the compound lens     +6.407\r\n\r\nOn the general principles above stated, a good astronomical eye-piece\r\nmay be easily constructed with two proper lenses, either according to\r\nthe plan of Huygens or that of Ramsden; and, from what has been now\r\nstated it is demonstrably certain, that, in all cases where two glasses\r\nare properly combined, such an eye-piece is superior to a single lens,\r\nboth in point of distinctness, and of the enlargement of the field of\r\nview. I lately fitted up an eye-piece, on Ramsden’s principle, with\r\ntwo lenses, each about 3 inches focal length, and 1-3/8 inch diameter,\r\nplaced at half an inch distant, with their convex surfaces facing\r\neach other as in fig. 74, which forms an excellent eye-piece for an\r\nachromatic telescope, 6 feet 8 inches focal distance, and 4 inches\r\naperture, particularly for viewing clusters of stars, the Milky Way,\r\nand the large nebulæ. The field of view is large, the magnifying power\r\nis only between 50 and 60 times, and the quantity of light being so\r\ngreat, every celestial object appears with great brilliancy, and it is\r\nin general much preferable, when applied to the stars than any of the\r\nhigher powers. When applied to _Presepe_ in Cancer, it exhibits that\r\ngroup at one view, as consisting of nearly a 100 stars which exhibit a\r\nbeautiful and most striking appearance.\r\n\r\nIt may appear a curious circumstance that any eye-piece which is good\r\nwith a short telescope, is also good with a long one, but that the\r\nreverse is not true; for it is found to be more difficult to make\r\na good eye-piece for a short than for a long focal distance of the\r\nobject-glass.\r\n\r\nCelestial eye-pieces are sometimes constructed so as to produce\r\n_variable powers_. This is effected by giving a motion to the lens next\r\nthe eye, so as to remove it nearer to or farther from the field lens;\r\nfor at every different distance at which it is placed from the other\r\nlens, the magnifying power will either be increased or diminished. The\r\ngreatest power is when the two lenses are nearly in contact, and the\r\npower diminishes in proportion to the distance at which the glass next\r\nthe eye is removed from the other. The scale of distance, however,\r\nbetween the two lenses, cannot be greater than the focal distance of\r\nthe field, or inner glass; for if it were, the lenses would no longer\r\nform an eye-piece, but would be changed into an inverting opera-glass.\r\nFor effecting the purpose now stated, the eye-glass is fixed in a\r\ntube which slides upon an interior tube on which is marked a scale of\r\ndistances, corresponding to certain magnifying powers; and, in this way\r\nan eye-piece may be made to magnify about double the number of times,\r\nwhen the lenses are in one position than when they are in another--as,\r\nfor example, all the powers from 36 to 72 times may be thus applied,\r\nmerely by regulating the distance between the two lenses. When the\r\nglasses are varied in this manner the eye-piece becomes sometimes a\r\n_positive_ eye-piece, like Ramsden’s, and sometimes a negative one like\r\nthat of Huygens.\r\n\r\n_Diagonal eye-pieces._ The eye-pieces to which we have now adverted,\r\nwhen adapted to refracting telescopes, both reverse and invert the\r\nobject, and therefore are not calculated for showing terrestrial\r\nobjects in their natural position. But as the heavenly bodies are of a\r\nspherical form, this circumstance detracts nothing from their utility.\r\nWhen the celestial object, however, is at a high altitude, the observer\r\nis obliged to place his head in a very inconvenient position, and to\r\ndirect his eye nearly upwards; in which position he cannot remain long\r\nat ease, or observe with a steady eye. To remedy this inconvenience,\r\nthe diagonal eye-piece has been invented, which admits of the eye\r\nbeing applied at the side--or at the upper part of the eye-piece,\r\ninstead of the end; and when such an eye-piece is used, it is of no\r\nimportance in what direction the telescope is elevated, as the observer\r\ncan then either sit or stand erect, and look down upon the object with\r\nthe utmost ease. This object is effected by placing a flat piece of\r\npolished speculum-metal at an angle of 45 degrees in respect to the two\r\nlenses of the eye-piece, which alters the direction of the converging\r\nrays, and forms an image which becomes erect with respect to altitude,\r\nbut is reversed with respect to azimuth;--that is, in other words,\r\nwhen we look down upon the objects in the field of view, they appear\r\nerect; but that part of an object which is in reality on our right hand\r\nappears on our left; and if it be in motion, its _apparent_ is opposite\r\nto its _real_ motion; if it be moving towards the west, it will seem to\r\nmove towards the east.\r\n\r\nThere are three situations in which the diagonal reflector in this\r\neye-piece may be placed. It may be placed either 1. before the\r\neye-piece,--or 2. behind it,--or 3. between the two lenses of which\r\nthe eye-piece consists. The most common position of the reflector is\r\nbetween the lenses; and this may be done both in the negative and the\r\npositive eye-pieces; but as the distance between the two lenses is\r\nnecessarily considerable, to make room for the diagonal position of the\r\nreflector, the magnifying power cannot be great; otherwise, a diagonal\r\neye-piece of this construction remains always in adjustment, and is\r\nuseful in all cases where a high power is not required. The following\r\nis a description and representation of a diagonal eye-piece of this\r\nkind in my possession.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 77._]\r\n\r\nIn fig. 77, AB represents the plano-convex lens next the object, which\r\nis about 2 inches in focal length, and 3/4 inch in diameter; CD, a\r\nplain metallic speculum of an oval form, well polished, and placed at\r\nhalf a right angle to the axis of the tube; and EF another plano-convex\r\nlens, about 1-1/2 inch focal distance. The centre of the speculum is\r\nabout 1-1/4 inch from the lens AB, and about 1/2 or 1/3 inch from EF;\r\nso that this eye-piece is a _positive_ one, on the principle proposed\r\nby Ramsden. The rays proceeding from the lens AB, and falling upon the\r\nspeculum, are reflected in a perpendicular direction to the lens EF,\r\nwhere they enter the eye at G, which looks down upon the object through\r\nthe side of the tube. The real size of this eye-piece is much about the\r\nsame as that represented in the figure. When applied to an achromatic\r\ntelescope of 44-1/2 inches focal distance it produces a magnifying\r\npower of 36 times, and exhibits a very beautiful view of the whole\r\nof the full moon. It likewise presents a very pleasing prospect of\r\nterrestrial objects, which appear as if situated immediately below us.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 78._]\r\n\r\nAnother plan of the diagonal eye-piece is represented in fig. 78, where\r\nthe speculum is fixed _within_ the sliding tube which receives the\r\neye-piece, or immediately below it. The part of the tube at AB slides\r\ninto the tube of the telescope, CD is the speculum placed at half a\r\nright angle to the axis of the tube, and EF, the tube containing the\r\nlenses, which stands at right angles to the position of the telescope,\r\nand slides into an exterior tube, and the eye is applied at G. This\r\nconstruction of the diagonal eye-piece may be used with any eye-piece\r\nwhatever, whether the Huygenian or that of Ramsden. It will admit of\r\nany magnifying power, and if several different eye-pieces be fitted\r\nto the sliding tube, they may be changed at pleasure. This form of\r\nthe diagonal eye-piece, I therefore consider as the best and the\r\nmost convenient construction, although it is not commonly adopted by\r\nopticians.\r\n\r\nWhen any of these eye-pieces are applied to a telescope, with the lens\r\nE on the upper part of it, we look down upon the object, if it be a\r\nterrestrial one, as if it were under our feet. If we turn the eye-piece\r\nround in its socket a quarter of a circle towards the left, an object\r\ndirectly before us in the south, will appear as if it were in the\r\n_west_ and turned upside down. If, from this position, it is turned\r\nround a semicircle towards the right, and the eye applied, the same\r\nobject will appear as if it were situated in the east, and inverted;\r\nand if it be turned round another quadrant, till it be directly\r\nopposite to its first position, and the eye applied from below, the\r\nobject or landscape will appear as if suspended in the atmosphere above\r\nus. This eye-piece, therefore, is capable of exhibiting objects in a\r\ngreat variety of aspects, and the use of it is both pleasant and easy\r\nfor the observer. But there is a considerable loss of light, occasioned\r\nby the reflection from the speculum, which is sensibly felt when very\r\nhigh powers are applied; and therefore when very small stars are to be\r\nobserved, such as some of those connected with double or triple stars,\r\nthe observer should not study his own ease so much as the quantity of\r\nlight he can retain with a high power, which object is best attained\r\nwith an ordinary eye-piece and a telescope of large aperture.\r\n\r\nWe have said that a diagonal eye-piece may be constructed with a\r\nreflector _before_ the eye-piece. In this case, the speculum is\r\nsometimes made to slide before the eye at the requisite angle of\r\nreclination, in which application each eye-piece must necessarily have\r\na groove to receive it, and the eye must be applied without a hole\r\nto direct it, but it may be put on and taken off without disturbing\r\nthe adjustment for distinct vision, and is very simple in its\r\napplication. But, on the whole, the form represented in fig. 78, is\r\nthe most convenient, and should generally be preferred, as any common\r\nastronomical eye-piece can be applied to it. I have used a diagonal\r\neye-piece of this kind, with good effect, when a power of 180 has been\r\napplied to the sun and other celestial objects.\r\n\r\nInstead of a metallic speculum, a _rectangular prism of glass_\r\nis sometimes substituted; for the rays of light are then bent by\r\nreflection from the second polished surface, which ought to be _dry_,\r\nand undergo two refractions which achromatise them; and the same effect\r\nis thus produced as by polished metal. Ramsden sometimes gave one of\r\nthe polished faces of a right angled prism a curve, which prism served\r\ninstead of a lens in an eye-piece, and also performed the office of a\r\nreflector. A semi-globe, or what has been called a Bull’s eye, has also\r\nbeen used as a diagonal eye-piece, and when the curve is well-formed,\r\nand the glass good, it is achromatic, and is said to perform pretty\r\nwell, but it is not superior to the forms already described.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 2.--TERRESTRIAL EYE-PIECES.\r\n\r\nWhen describing the common refracting telescope, (p. 228.) I have\r\nnoticed that three eye-glasses, placed at double their focal distances\r\nfrom each other, formerly constituted the terrestrial eye-piece,\r\nas represented in fig. 47. But this construction, especially for\r\nachromatic instruments, has now become obsolete, and is never used,\r\nexcept in small pocket spy-glasses formed with a single object lens. In\r\nits place a four glassed eye-piece has been substituted, which is now\r\nuniversally used in all good telescopes, and which, besides improving\r\nthe vision and producing an erect position of the images of objects,\r\npresents a considerably larger field of view. During the progressive\r\nstages of improvement made in the construction of erect eye-pieces by\r\nDollond and Ramsden, three, four, and five lenses were successively\r\nintroduced; and hence, in some of the old telescopes constructed by\r\nthese artists, we frequently find five lenses of different descriptions\r\ncomposing the eye-piece. But four lenses, arranged in the manner I\r\nam now about to describe, have ultimately obtained the preference.\r\nIn a telescope having a celestial eye-piece of the Huygenian form,\r\nthe image that is formed in the focus of the object glass, is that\r\nwhich is seen magnified, and in an inverted position; but when a four\r\nglassed eye-piece is used, which produces an erect view of the object,\r\nthe image is repeated, and the _second_ image, which is formed by\r\nthe inner pair of lenses AB on an enlarged scale, is that which the\r\npair of lenses CD at the eye-end render visible on a scale still more\r\nenlarged. The modern terrestrial eye-piece, represented in fig. 79,\r\nis, in fact, nothing else than a compound microscope, consisting of an\r\nobject lens, an amplifying lens, and an eye-piece composed of a pair\r\nof lenses on the principle of the Huygenian eye-piece. Its properties\r\nwill be best understood by considering the first image of an object,\r\nwhich is formed in the focus of the object glass, as a small luminous\r\nobject to be rendered visible, in a magnified state, by a compound\r\nmicroscope. The object to be magnified may be considered as placed near\r\nthe point A, and the magnified image at _i_, which is viewed by the\r\nlens D. Hence, if we look through such an eye-piece at a small object\r\nplaced very near the lens A, we shall find that it acts as a compound\r\nmicroscope of a moderate magnifying power increasing, in some cases,\r\nthe diameter of the object about 10 times, and 100 times in surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 79._]\r\n\r\nIn order to distinguish the different lenses in this eye-piece, we may\r\ncall the lens A, which is next to the first image, the _object-lens_,\r\nthe next to it B, the _amplifying-lens_, the third, or C, the\r\n_field-lens_, and the one next the eye, D, the _eye-lens_. The first\r\nimage formed a little before A, may be denominated the _radiant_, or\r\nthe object from which the rays proceed. Now, it is well known as a\r\nprinciple in optics, that if the radiant be brought nearer to the lens\r\nthan its principal focus, the emerging rays will _diverge_, and, on\r\nthe contrary, if the radiant be put farther from the lens than its\r\nprincipal focal distance, the emerging rays will _converge_ to a point\r\nat a distance beyond the lens, which will depend on the distance of the\r\nradiant from the first face of the lens. In this place an image of the\r\nradiant will be formed by the concurrence of the converging rays, but\r\nin a contrary position; and the length of the image will exceed the\r\nlength of the radiant in the same proportion, as the distance of the\r\nimage from the radiant exceeds that of the radiant from the lens. This\r\nsecondary image of the radiant at _i_, is not well-defined, when only\r\none lens, as A, is used, owing to the great spherical aberrations, and\r\ntherefore the amplifying lens is placed at the distance of the shorter\r\nconjugate focus, with an intervening diaphragm of a small diameter at\r\nthe place of the principal focus; the uses of which lens and diaphragm\r\nare, first to cut off the coloured rays that are occasioned by the\r\ndispersive property of the object lens,--and secondly, to bring the\r\nrays to a shorter conjugate focus for the place of the image, than\r\nwould have taken place with a single lens having only one refraction.\r\nAs the secondary image is in this way much better defined and free from\r\ncolouration, the addition of this second lens is a great improvement to\r\nvision. For this reason I am clearly of opinion, that the object glass\r\nof a compound microscope, instead of consisting of a small single lens,\r\nshould be formed of two lenses on the principle now stated, which would\r\nunquestionably add to the distinctness of vision.\r\n\r\nWith respect to _the proportions of the focal lengths of the lenses_\r\nin this four glass eye-piece, Mr. Coddington states, that if the focal\r\nlengths, reckoning from A to D, fig. 79, be as the numbers 3, 4, 4 and\r\n3, and the distances between them on the same scale, 4, 6, and 5, 2,\r\nthe radii, reckoning from the outer surface of A, should be thus:--\r\n\r\n  A {First surface  27 }nearly plano-convex.\r\n    {Second surface  1 }\r\n\r\n  B {First surface   9 }a miniscus.\r\n    {Second surface  4 }\r\n\r\n  C {First surface    1 }nearly plano-convex.\r\n    {Second surface  21 }\r\n\r\n  D {First surface    1 }double convex.\r\n    {Second surface  24 }\r\n\r\nSir D. Brewster states, that a good achromatic eye-piece may be made of\r\n4 lenses, if their focal lengths, reckoning from that next the object,\r\nbe as the numbers 14, 21, 27, 32; their distances 23, 44, 40; their\r\napertures 5.6; 3.4; 13.5; 2.6; and the aperture of the diaphragm placed\r\nin the interior focus of the fourth eye-glass, 7. Another proportion\r\nmay be stated:--Suppose the lens next the object A, to be 1-7/8 inch\r\nfocal length, then B may be 2-1/2 inches, C 2 inches, and D 1-1/2; and\r\ntheir distances AB 2-1/2; BC 3-5/8; and CD 2-3/8. In one of Ramsden’s\r\nsmall telescopes, whose object glass was 8-1/2 inches in focal length,\r\nand its magnifying power 15.4, the focal lengths of the eye glasses\r\nwere A 0.775 of an inch, B 1.025, C 1.01, D 0.79;--the distances AB\r\n1.18, BC 1.83, and CD 1.105. In the excellent achromatic telescope\r\nof Dollond’s construction which belonged to the Duc de Chaulnes, the\r\nfocal lengths of the eye glasses, beginning with that next the object,\r\nwere 14-1/4 lines, 19, 22-3/4, 14; their distances 22.48 lines, 46.17,\r\n21.45, and their thickness at the centre, 1.23 lines, 1.25, 1.47. The\r\nfourth lens was plano-convex, with the plane side to the eye, and the\r\nrest were double convex lenses. This telescope was in focal length 3\r\nfeet 5-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nThe magnifying power of this eye-piece, as usually made, differs only\r\nin a small degree from what would be produced by using the first or\r\nthe fourth glass alone, in which case the magnifying power would be\r\nsomewhat greater, but the vision less distinct, and were the lens next\r\nthe eye used alone without the field glass, the field of view would\r\nbe much contracted. Stops should be placed between the lenses A and B,\r\nnear to B, and a larger one between C and D, to prevent any false light\r\nfrom passing through the lenses to the eye. The more stops that are\r\nintroduced into a telescope--which should all be blackened--provided\r\nthey do not hinder the pencils of light proceeding from the object, the\r\nbetter will the instrument perform.\r\n\r\nFor the information of amateur constructors of telescopes, I shall\r\nhere state the dimensions of two or three four glassed eye-pieces in\r\nmy possession, which perform with great distinctness, and present a\r\npretty large field of view. In one of these, adapted to a 44-1/2 inch\r\nachromatic, the lens A, next the object, is 1-7/8 inch, focal length,\r\nand about 1 inch diameter, with the plane side, next the object. The\r\nfocal length of the lens B 2-1/10 inches, diameter 7/10 inch, with its\r\nplane side next A; distance of these lenses from each other 2-4/10\r\ninches. Distance of the field lens C from the lens B 5-1/2 inches. The\r\nsmall hole or diaphragm between A and B is at the focus of A, and is\r\nabout 1/6 inch diameter, and about 3/8 of an inch from the lens B. The\r\nfield lens C is 2 inches focal length, and 1-1/4 inch diameter, with\r\nits plane side next the eye. The lens next the eye D is 1 inch focal\r\ndistance, 1/2 inch diameter, and is distant from the field glass 1-3/4\r\ninch, with its plane side next the eye. The magnifying power of this\r\neye-piece is equivalent to that of a single lens whose focal length is\r\nhalf an inch, and with the 44-1/2 inch object glass produces a power of\r\nabout 90 times. The lens next the eye can be changed for another 1-3/8\r\ninch focal length, which produces a power of 65; and the two glasses\r\nCD can be changed for another set, of a longer focal distance which\r\nproduces a power of 45 times. The whole length of this eye-piece is\r\n11-1/2 inches.\r\n\r\nIn another eye-piece, adapted to a pocket achromatic, whose object\r\nglass is 9 inches focal length, the lens A is 1 inch focal length,\r\nand 1/2 inch diameter; the lens B 1-1/4 inch, and 1/2 inch diameter,\r\ntheir distance 1-1/2 inch, the lens C 1-1/10 inch focal length, and\r\n5/8 inch diameter; the eye-lens D 5/8 inch focal length, and 3/8 inch\r\ndiameter; distance between C and D 1-1/8 inch. The distance between B\r\nand C 1-3/4 inch. The whole length of this eye-piece is 4-1/2 inches,\r\nand its power is nearly equal to that of a single lens of 1/2 or 6/10\r\nof an inch focal length, the magnifying power of the telescope being\r\nabout 16 times. Another eye-piece of much larger dimensions, has the\r\nlens A of 2-1/2 inches focal length, and 3/4 inch diameter: the lens\r\nB 2-3/4 inches focus and 5/8 inch diameter; and their distance 2-3/4\r\ninches; the lens C 2-5/8 inches focus and 1-1/8 inch diameter; the lens\r\nD 1-3/4 inch focus and 3/4 inch diameter; distance from each other\r\n2-3/4 inches. The distance between the lenses B and C is 4 inches. The\r\nmagnifying power is equal to that of a single lens 1-1/8 inch focal\r\ndistance. When applied to an achromatic object glass 6 feet 7 inches\r\nfocal length, it produces a power of about 70 times. This eye-piece has\r\na moveable tube 9 inches in length in which the two lenses next the\r\neye are contained, by pulling out which, and consequently increasing\r\nthe distance between the lenses B and C, the magnifying power may be\r\nincreased to 100, 120 or 140, according to the distance to which this\r\nmoveable tube is drawn out. It has also a second and third set of\r\nlenses, corresponding to C and D of a shorter focal distance, which\r\nproduce higher magnifying powers on a principle to be afterwards\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of an eye-piece, &c. of an old Dutch Achromatic Telescope._\r\n\r\nAbout twenty or thirty years ago, I purchased, in an optician’s shop\r\nin Edinburgh, a small achromatic telescope, made in Amsterdam, which\r\nwas supposed, by the optician, to have been constructed prior to the\r\ninvention of achromatic telescopes by Mr. Dollond. It is mounted wholly\r\nof brass, and in all its parts is a piece of beautiful and exquisite\r\nworkmanship, and the utmost care seems to have been taken to have all\r\nthe glasses and diaphragms accurately adjusted. The object glass is a\r\ndouble achromatic, 6-1/2 inches focal distance and 1 inch diameter,\r\nbut the clear aperture is only 7/8 inch diameter. It is perfectly\r\nachromatic, and would bear a power of 50 times, if it had a sufficient\r\nquantity of light. The following inscription is engraved on the tube\r\nadjacent to the object glass:--“_Jan van Deyl en Zoon Invenit et\r\nFecit, Amsterdam, Ao. 1769_.” Although Dollond exhibited the principle\r\nof an achromatic telescope, eight or ten years before the date here\r\nspecified, yet it is not improbable that the artist whose name is\r\nhere stated, may not have heard of Dollond’s invention; and that he\r\nwas really, as he assumes, one of the inventors of the achromatic\r\ntelescope. For, the invention of this telescope by Dollond was not very\r\ngenerally known, except among philosophers and the London opticians,\r\ntill a number of years after the date above stated. Euler, in his\r\n“Letters to a German Princess”--in which telescopes are particularly\r\ndescribed, makes no mention of, nor the least allusion to the invention\r\nof Dollond, though this was a subject which particularly engaged his\r\nattention. Now, these letters were written in 1762, but were not\r\npublished till 1770. When alluding to the defects in telescopes arising\r\nfrom the different refrangibility of the rays of light, in Letter\r\n43, and that they might possibly be rectified by means of different\r\ntransparent substances, he says, ‘But neither theory nor practice have\r\nhitherto been carried to the degree of perfection necessary to the\r\nexecution of a structure which should remedy these defects.’ Mr. B.\r\nMartin, in his ‘Gentleman and Lady’s Philosophy,’ published in 1781,\r\nalludes to the achromatic telescope, but speaks of it as it were but\r\nvery little, if at all superior to the common refracting telescope. And\r\ntherefore, I think it highly probable that Jan van Deyl, was really an\r\ninventor of an achromatic telescope, before he had any notice of what\r\nDollond and others had done in this way some short time before.\r\n\r\nBut my principal object in adverting to this telescope, is to describe\r\nthe structure of the eye-piece, which is a very fine one, and which\r\nis somewhat different from the achromatic eye-piece above described.\r\nIt consists of four glasses, two combined next the eye, and two next\r\nthe object. Each of these combinations forms an astronomical eye-piece\r\nnearly similar to the Huygenian. The lens A, next the object, fig. 80,\r\nis 5/8 inch focal distance, and 4/10 inch diameter; the lens B 3/8 inch\r\nfocus, and 1/5 inch diameter, and the distance between them somewhat\r\nless than 5/8 inch; the diameter of the aperture _e_ about 1/15 of an\r\ninch. This combination forms an excellent astronomical eye-piece, with\r\na large flat field, and its magnifying power is equivalent to that of\r\na single lens 5/8 or 6/8 focal length. The lens C is 1/2 inch focal\r\nlength, and 4/10 inch diameter; the lens D 1/4 inch focus, and about\r\n1/5 inch diameter; their distance about 1/2 inch, or a small fraction\r\nmore. The hole at _d_ is about 1/20 or 1/25 of an inch diameter, and\r\nthe distance between the lenses B and C about 1-1/2 inch. The whole\r\nlength of the eye-piece is 3-1/4 inches--exactly the same size as\r\nrepresented in the engraving. Its magnifying power is equal to that of\r\na single lens 1/4 inch focal length; and consequently the telescope,\r\nthough only 9-1/2 inches long, magnifies 26 times, with great\r\ndistinctness, though there is a little deficiency of light when viewing\r\nland objects, which are not well illuminated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 80._]\r\n\r\nThe glasses of this telescope are all plano-convex, with their\r\nconvex-sides towards the object--except the lens D, which is double\r\nconvex, but flattest on the side next the eye, and they are all very\r\naccurately finished. The two lenses C and D form an astronomical\r\neye-piece nearly similar to that formed by the lenses A and B. The\r\nfocus of the telescope is adjusted by a screw, the threads of which are\r\nformed upon the outside of a tube into which the eye-piece slides. The\r\neye-piece and apparatus connected with it, is screwed into the inside\r\nof the main tube, when not in use, when the instrument forms a compact\r\nbrass cylinder 6 inches long, which is enclosed in a fish-skin case,\r\nlined with silk velvet, which opens with hinges.\r\n\r\nThe lenses in the eye-pieces formerly described, though stated to be\r\nplano-convexes, are for the most part _crossed glasses_, that is\r\nground on tools of a long focus on the one side, and to a short focus\r\non the other. The construction of the eye-piece of the Dutch telescope\r\nabove described, is one which might be adopted with a good effect\r\nin most of our achromatic telescopes; and I am persuaded, from the\r\napplication I have made of it to various telescopes, that it is even\r\nsuperior, in distinctness and accuracy, and in the _flatness of field_\r\nwhich it produces to the eye-piece in common use. The two astronomical\r\neye-pieces of which it consists, when applied to large achromatic\r\ntelescopes, perform with great accuracy, and are excellently adapted\r\nfor celestial observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. 3.--DESCRIPTION OF THE PANCRATIC EYE-TUBE.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have stated, when describing the common terrestrial\r\neye-piece now applied to achromatic instruments, (p. 349, fig. 79.), it\r\nappears obvious, that any variety of magnifying powers, within certain\r\nlimits, may be obtained by removing the set of lenses CD, fig. 79,\r\nnearer to or farther from the tube which contains the lenses A and B,\r\non the same principle as the magnifying power of a compound microscope\r\nis increased by removing the eye-glasses to a greater distance from\r\nthe object-lens. If then, the pair of eye-lenses CD be attached to an\r\ninner tube that will draw out and increase their distance from the\r\ninner pair of lenses, as the tube _a b c d_, the magnifying power may\r\nbe indefinitely increased or diminished, by pushing in or drawing out\r\nthe sliding tube, and a scale might be placed on this tube, which, if\r\ndivided into equal intervals, will be a scale of magnifying powers, by\r\nwhich the power of the telescope will be seen at every division, when\r\nthe lowest power is once determined.\r\n\r\nSir David Brewster, in his ‘Treatise on New Philosophical instruments,’\r\nBook i. chap. vii. page 59, published in 1813, has adverted to this\r\ncircumstance, in his description of an ‘Eye-piece wire micrometer,’ and\r\ncomplains of Mr. Ezekiel Walker, having in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’\r\nfor August, 1811, described such an instrument as an invention of his\r\nown. Dr. Kitchener some years afterwards, described what he called a\r\nPancratic or omnipotent eye-piece, and got one made by Dollond, with a\r\nfew modifications different from that suggested by Brewster and Walker,\r\nwhich were little else than cutting the single tube into several parts,\r\nand giving it the _appearance_ of a new invention. In fact, none of\r\nthese gentlemen had a right to claim it as his peculiar invention, as\r\nthe principle was known and recognised long before. I had increased the\r\nmagnifying powers of telescopes, on the same principle, several years\r\nbefore any of these gentlemen communicated their views on the subject,\r\nalthough I never formally constructed a scale of powers. Mr. B. Martin,\r\nwho died in 1782, proposed many years before, such a moveable interior\r\ntube as that alluded to, for varying the magnifying power.\r\n\r\nIn order to give the reader a more specific idea of this contrivance,\r\nI shall present him with a figure and description of one of Dr.\r\nKitchener’s Pancratic eye-pieces, copied from one lately in my\r\npossession. The following are the exact dimensions of this instrument,\r\nwith the focal distances, &c. of the glasses, &c. of which it is\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _fig. 81._]\r\n\r\n                                                      In.  Tenths.\r\n  Length of the whole eye-piece, consisting of\r\n  four tubes, when fully drawn out, or the distance\r\n  from A to B. fig. 81.                                14       4\r\n\r\n  Length of the three tubes on which the\r\n  scale is engraved, from the commencement of\r\n  the divisions at B to their termination at C.         9      15\r\n\r\n  Each division into tens is equal to 3-10ths of an inch.\r\n\r\n  When the three inner tubes are shut up to\r\n  C, the length of the eye-piece is exactly             5       5\r\n\r\n  When these tubes are thus shut up, the magnifying\r\n  power for a 3-1/2 feet achromatic is 100\r\n  times, which is the smallest power. When the\r\n  inner tube is drawn out 1/3 of an inch, or to\r\n  the first division, the power is 110, &c.\r\n\r\n  Focal distance of the lens next the object            1       0\r\n\r\n  Breadth of Ditto.                                     0      65\r\n\r\n  The plane side of this glass is next the object.\r\n\r\n  Focal distance of the second glass from the\r\n  object                                                1       5\r\n\r\n  This glass is double and equally convex,\r\n  Breadth                                               0       5\r\n\r\n  Distance between these two glasses                    1       7\r\n\r\n  Focal distance of the third or field lens,\r\n  which is plane on the side next the eye               1       1\r\n\r\n  Breadth of Ditto.                                     0      55\r\n\r\n  Focal distance of the lens next the eye               0       6\r\n\r\n  Breadth                                               0      43\r\n\r\n  This glass is plane on the side next the eye.\r\n\r\n  Distance between the third and fourth glasses.        1       1\r\n\r\nFrom the figure and description, the reader will be at no loss to\r\nperceive how the magnifying power is ascertained by this eye-piece.\r\nIf the lowest power for a 44 inch telescope be found to be 100, when\r\nthe three sliding tubes are shut into the larger one, then by drawing\r\nout the tube next the eye 4 divisions, a power of 140 is produced; by\r\ndrawing out the tube next the eye its whole length, and the second\r\ntube to the division marked 220, a power of 220 times is produced, and\r\ndrawing out all the tubes to their utmost extent, as represented in\r\nthe figure, a power of 400 is obtained. These powers are by far too\r\nhigh for such a telescope, as the powers between 300 and 400 can seldom\r\nor never be used. Were the scale to begin at 50, and terminate at\r\n200, it would be much better adapted to a 3-1/2 feet telescope. Each\r\nalteration of the magnifying power requires a new adjustment of the\r\neye-piece for distinct vision. As the magnifying power is increased,\r\nthe distance between the eye-glass and the object-glass must be\r\ndiminished. Dr. Kitchener says, that ‘the pancratic eye tube gives a\r\nbetter defined image of a fixed star, and shows double stars decidedly\r\nmore distinct and perfectly separated than any other eye tube, and\r\nthat such tubes will probably enable us to determine the distances\r\nof these objects from each other, in a more perfect manner than has\r\nbeen possible heretofore.’ These tubes are made by Dollond, London,\r\nand are sold for two guineas each. But I do not think they excel, in\r\ndistinctness, those which are occasionally made by Mr. Tulley and other\r\nopticians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS REMARKS IN RELATION TO TELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nThe following remarks, chiefly in regard to the manner of using\r\ntelescopes, may perhaps be useful to young observers, who are not much\r\naccustomed to the mode of managing these instruments.\r\n\r\n1. _Adjustments requisite to be attended to in the use of telescopes._\r\nWhen near objects are viewed with a considerable magnifying power, the\r\neye-tube requires to be removed farther from the object-glass than\r\nwhen very distant objects are contemplated. When the telescope is\r\nadjusted for an object, 6, 8, or 10 miles distant, a very considerable\r\nalteration in the adjustment is requisite in order to see distinctly\r\nan object at the distance of two or three hundred yards, especially if\r\nthe instrument is furnished with a high magnifying power. In this last\r\ncase, the eye-tube requires to be drawn out to a considerable distance\r\nbeyond the focus for parallel rays. I have found that, in a telescope\r\nwhich magnifies 70 times, when adjusted for an object at the distance\r\nof two miles, the adjustment requires to be altered fully one inch in\r\norder to perceive distinctly an object at the distance of two or three\r\nhundred yards; that is, the tube must be drawn, in this case, an inch\r\nfarther from the object-glass, and pushed in the same extent, when we\r\nwish to view an object at the distance of two or three miles. These\r\nadjustments are made, in pocket perspectives, by gently sliding the\r\neye-tube in or out, by giving it a gentle circular or spiral motion\r\ntill the object appear distinct. In using telescopes which are held\r\nin the hand, the best plan is to draw all the tubes out to their full\r\nlength, and then, looking at the object, with the left hand supporting\r\nthe main tube near the object-glass, and the right supporting the\r\neye-tube--gently and gradually push in the eye-piece till distinct\r\nvision be obtained. In Gregorian reflecting telescopes this adjustment\r\nis made by means of a screw connected with the small speculum; and in\r\nlarge achromatics, by means of a rack and pinion connected with the\r\neye-tube. When the magnifying power of a telescope is comparatively\r\nsmall, the eye-tube requires to be altered only a very little.\r\n\r\nThere is another adjustment requisite to be attended to, in order to\r\nadapt the telescope to the eyes of different persons. Those whose eyes\r\nare too convex, or who are short-sighted, require the eye-tube to be\r\npushed in, and those whose eyes are somewhat flattened, as old people,\r\nrequire the tube to be drawn out. Indeed there are scarcely two persons\r\nwhose eyes do not require different adjustments in a slight degree.\r\nIn some cases I have found that the difference of adjustment for two\r\nindividuals, in order to produce distinct vision in each, amounted\r\nto nearly half an inch. Hence the difficulty of exhibiting the sun,\r\nmoon, and planets through telescopes, and even terrestrial objects,\r\nto a company of persons who are unacquainted with the mode of using\r\nor adjusting such instruments--not one half of whom generally see\r\nthe object distinctly--for, upon the proper adjustment of a telescope\r\nto the eye, the accuracy of vision, in all cases, depends; and no one\r\nexcept the individual actually looking through the instrument, can\r\nbe certain that it is accurately adjusted to his eye, and even the\r\nindividual himself, from not being accustomed to the view of certain\r\nobjects, may be uncertain whether or not the adjustment be correct. I\r\nhave found by experience that when the magnifying powers are high, as\r\n150 or 200, the difference of adjustment required for different eyes\r\nis very slight; but when low powers are used, as 20, 30, or 40, the\r\ndifference of the requisite adjustments is sometimes very considerable,\r\namounting to 1/4 or 1/2 of an inch.\r\n\r\n2. _State of the Atmosphere most proper for observing terrestrial\r\nand celestial objects._ The atmosphere which is thrown around the\r\nglobe--while it is essentially requisite to the physical constitution\r\nof our world, and the comfort of its inhabitants--is found in\r\nmany instances a serious obstruction to the accurate performance\r\nof telescopes. Sometimes it is obscured by mists and exhalations,\r\nsometimes it is thrown into violent undulations by the heat of the\r\nsun and the process of evaporation, and even, in certain cases, where\r\nthere appears a pure unclouded azure, there is an agitation among its\r\nparticles and the substances incorporated with them, which prevents\r\nthe telescope from producing distinct vision either of terrestrial or\r\ncelestial objects. For viewing distant terrestrial objects, especially\r\nwith high powers, the best time is early in the morning, a little\r\nafter sun-rise, and, from that period till about 9 o’clock A.M., in\r\nsummer; and, in the evening about two or three hours before sun-set.\r\nFrom about 10 o’clock A.M. till 4 or 5 in the afternoon, in\r\nsummer, if the sky be clear and the sun shining, there is generally\r\na considerable undulation in the atmosphere, occasioned by the solar\r\nrays and the rapid evaporation, which prevents high powers from being\r\nused with distinctness on any telescope, however excellent. The objects\r\nat such times, when powers of 50, 70, or 100 are applied, appear to\r\nundulate like the waves of the sea, and, notwithstanding every effort\r\nto adjust the telescope, they appear confused and indistinct. Even\r\nwith very moderate magnifying powers this imperfection is perceptible.\r\nIn such circumstances, I have sometimes used a power of 200 times\r\non distant land objects, with good effect, a little before sun-set,\r\nwhen, in the forenoon of the same day, I could not have applied a\r\npower of 50 with any degree of distinctness. On days when the air is\r\nclear, and the atmosphere covered with clouds, terrestrial objects\r\nmay be viewed with considerably high powers. When there has been a\r\nlong-continued drought, the atmosphere is then in a very unfit state\r\nfor enjoying distinct vision with high magnifying powers, on account of\r\nthe quantity of vapours with which the atmosphere is then surcharged,\r\nand the undulations they produce. But, after copious showers of rain,\r\nespecially if accompanied with high winds, the air is purified, and\r\ndistant objects appear with greater brilliancy and distinctness than at\r\nany other seasons. In using telescopes, the objects at which we look\r\nshould, if possible, be nearly in a direction opposite to that of the\r\nsun. When they are viewed nearly in the direction of the sun, their\r\nshadows are turned towards us, and they consequently appear dim and\r\nobscure. By not attending to this circumstance, some persons, in trying\r\ntelescopes, have pronounced a good instrument to be imperfect, which,\r\nhad it been tried on objects properly illuminated, would have been\r\nfound to be excellent. In our variable northerly climate the atmosphere\r\nis not so clear and serene for telescopic observation as in Italy,\r\nthe South of France, and in many of the countries which lie within\r\nthe tropics. The undulations of the air, owing to the causes alluded\r\nto above, constitute one of the principal reasons why a telescope\r\nmagnifying above a hundred times can seldom be used with any good\r\neffect in viewing terrestrial objects--though I have sometimes used a\r\npower of nearly 200 with considerable distinctness, in the stillness\r\nof a summer or autumnal evening, when the rays of the declining sun\r\nstrongly illuminated distant objects.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is likewise frequently a great obstruction to the\r\ndistinct perception of _celestial_ objects. It is scarcely possible for\r\none who has not been accustomed to astronomical observations, to form\r\na conception of the very great difference there is in the appearance\r\nof some of the heavenly bodies in different states of the atmosphere.\r\nThere are certain conditions of the atmosphere essentially requisite\r\nfor making accurate observations with powerful telescopes, and it\r\nis but seldom, especially in our climate, that all the favourable\r\ncircumstances concur. The nights must be very clear and serene--the\r\nmoon absent--no twilight--no haziness--no violent wind--no sudden\r\nchange of temperature, as from thaw to frost--and no surcharge of the\r\natmosphere with aqueous vapour. I have frequently found that, on the\r\nfirst and second nights after a thaw, when a strong frost had set in,\r\nand when the heavens appeared very brilliant, and the stars vivid\r\nand sparkling--the planets, when viewed with high powers, appeared\r\nremarkably undefined and indistinct; their margins appeared waving and\r\njagged, and the belts of Jupiter, which at other times were remarkably\r\ndistinct, were so obscured and ill-defined, that they could with\r\ndifficulty be traced. This is probably owing to the quantity of aqueous\r\nvapour, and perhaps icy particles, then floating in the air, and to\r\nthe undulations thereby produced. When a hard frost has continued a\r\nconsiderable time, this impediment to distinct observation is in a\r\ngreat measure removed. But I have never enjoyed more accurate and\r\ndistinct views of the heavenly bodies than in fresh serene evenings,\r\nwhen there was no frost and no wind, and only a few fleecy clouds\r\noccasionally hovering around. On such evenings, and on such alone, the\r\nhighest powers may be applied. I have used magnifying powers on such\r\noccasions with good effect, which could not have been applied, so as to\r\nensure distinct vision, more frequently than two or three days in the\r\ncourse of a year.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel has observed, in reference to this point, ‘In\r\nbeautiful nights, when the outside of our telescopes is dropping with\r\nmoisture, discharged from the atmosphere, there are now and then\r\nfavourable _hours_ in which it is hardly possible to put a limit to\r\nthe magnifying powers. But such valuable opportunities are extremely\r\nscarce, and with large instruments it will always be lost labour to\r\nobserve at other times. In order therefore, to calculate how long a\r\ntime it must take to sweep the heavens, as far as they are within\r\nthe reach of my forty-feet telescope, charged with a magnifying\r\npower of 1000, I have had recourse to my journals to find how many\r\nfavourable hours we may annually hope for in this climate. And, under\r\nall favourable circumstances, it appears, that a year which will\r\nafford ninety, or at most, one hundred _hours_ is to be called very\r\nproductive.’ ‘In the equator, with my twenty feet telescope, I have\r\nswept over zones of two degrees with a power of 157, but an allowance\r\nof ten minutes in Polar distance must be made for lapping the sweeps\r\nover one another where they join. As the breadth of the zones may be\r\nincreased towards the poles, the northern hemisphere may be swept in\r\nabout 40 zones; to these we must add 19 southern zones; then 59 zones\r\nwhich, on account of the sweeps lapping over one another, about 5\r\nminutes of time in right ascension, we must reckon of 25 hours each,\r\nwill give 1475 hours. And allowing 100 hours per year, we find that\r\nwith the 20 feet telescope, the heavens may be swept in about 14 years\r\nand three quarters. Now the time of sweeping with different magnifying\r\npowers will be as the squares of the powers; and putting _p_ and _t_\r\nfor the power and time in the 20 feet telescope, and P = 1000 for\r\nthe power in the 40 feet instrument, we shall have p^2 : t :: P^2 :\r\n^{tP2}/_{p^2} = 59840. Then making the same allowance for 100 hours per\r\nyear, it appears that it will require not less than 598 years, to look\r\nwith the 40 feet reflector, charged with the above-mentioned power,\r\nonly one single moment into each point of space; and even then, so much\r\nof the southern hemisphere will remain unexplored, as will take up 213\r\nyears more to examine.’[28]\r\n\r\nFrom the above remarks of so eminent an observer, the reader will\r\nperceive how difficult it is to explore the heavens with minuteness and\r\naccuracy, and with how many disappointments, arising from the state\r\nof the atmosphere, the astronomer must lay his account, when employed\r\nin planetary or sidereal investigation. Besides the circumstances now\r\nstated, it ought to be noticed that a star or a planet is only in\r\na situation for a high magnifying power, about half the time it is\r\nabove the horizon. The density of the atmosphere, and the quantity of\r\nvapours with which it is charged near the horizon, prevent distinct\r\nvision of celestial objects with high powers, till they have risen to\r\nat least 15 or 20 degrees in altitude, and the highest magnifiers can\r\nscarcely be applied with good effect, unless the object is near the\r\nmeridian, and at a considerable elevation above the horizon. If the\r\nmoon be viewed a little after her rising, and afterwards when she comes\r\nto her highest elevation in autumn, the difference in her appearance\r\nand distinctness will be strikingly perceptible. It is impossible to\r\nguess whether a night be well adapted for celestial observations,\r\ntill we actually make the experiment, and instruments are frequently\r\ncondemned, when tried at improper seasons, when the atmosphere only is\r\nin fault. A certain observer remarks,--‘I have never seen the face of\r\nSaturn more distinctly than in a night when the air has been so hazy,\r\nthat with my naked eye, I could hardly discern a star of less than the\r\nthird magnitude.’ The degree of the transparency of the air is likewise\r\nvarying almost in the course of every minute, so that even in the\r\ncourse of the same half hour, planets and stars will appear perfectly\r\ndefined, and the reverse. The vapours moving and undulating the\r\natmosphere, even when the sky appears clear to the naked eye, will in a\r\nfew instants destroy the distinctness of vision, and in a few seconds\r\nmore, the object will resume its clear and well-defined aspect.[29]\r\n\r\n3. _On the magnifying powers requisite for observing the phenomena of\r\nthe different planets--comets--double stars, &c._\r\n\r\nThere are some objects connected with astronomy which cannot be\r\nperceived without having recourse to instruments and to powers of\r\ngreat magnitude. But it is a vulgar error to imagine that very large\r\nand very expensive telescopes are absolutely necessary for viewing\r\nthe greater part of the more interesting scenery of the heavens. Most\r\nof the phenomena of the planets, comets and double stars and other\r\nobjects, are visible with instruments of moderate dimensions, so that\r\nevery one who has a relish for celestial investigations, may, at a\r\ncomparatively small expense, procure a telescope, for occasional\r\nobservations, which will show the principal objects and phenomena\r\ndescribed in books on astronomy. Many persons have been misled by some\r\noccasional remarks which Sir W. Herschel made, in reference to certain\r\nvery high powers which he sometimes put, by way of experiment, on some\r\nof his telescopes, as if these were the powers requisite for viewing\r\nthe objects to which he refers. For example, it is stated that he once\r\nput a power of 6450 times on his 7 feet Newtonian telescope of 6-3/10\r\ninches aperture; but this was only for the purpose of an experiment,\r\nand could be of no use whatever when applied to the moon, the planets\r\nand most objects in the heavens. Herschel, through the whole course of\r\nhis writings, mentions his only having used it _twice_, namely on the\r\nstars α Lyræ, and γ Leonis, which stars can be seen more distinctly and\r\nsharply defined with a power of 420. To produce a power of 6450 on such\r\na telescope, would require a lens of only 1/77th of an inch in focal\r\ndistance, and it is questioned by some whether Herschel had lenses of\r\nso small a size in his possession, or whether it is possible to form\r\nthem with accuracy.\r\n\r\n_Powers requisite for observing the phenomena of the planets._--The\r\nplanet Mercury requires a considerable magnifying power, in order to\r\nperceive its phases with distinctness. I have seldom viewed this planet\r\nwith a less power than 100 and 150, with which powers its half moon,\r\nits gibbous, and its crescent phase, may be distinctly perceived. With\r\na power of 40, 50, or even 60 times, these phases can with difficulty\r\nbe seen, especially as it is generally at a low altitude, when such\r\nobservations are made. The phases of _Venus_ are much more easily\r\ndistinguished, especially the _crescent_ phase, which is seen to\r\nthe greatest advantage about a month before and after the inferior\r\nconjunction. With a power not exceeding 25 or 30 times, this phase,\r\nat such periods, may be easily perceived. It requires, however, much\r\nhigher powers to perceive distinctly the variations of the gibbous\r\nphase; and if this planet be not viewed at a considerably high altitude\r\nwhen in a half-moon or gibbous phase, the obscurity and undulations\r\nof the atmosphere near the horizon, prevent such phases from being\r\naccurately distinguished, even when high powers are applied. Although\r\ncertain phenomena of the planets may be seen with such low powers as\r\nI have now stated, yet, in every instance, the highest magnifying\r\npowers, consistent with distinctness, should be preferred, as the eye\r\nis not then strained, and the object appears with a greater degree of\r\nmagnitude and splendour. The planet _Mars_ requires a considerable\r\ndegree of magnifying power, even when at its nearest distance from the\r\nearth, in order to discern its spots and its gibbous phase. I have\r\nnever obtained a satisfactory view of the spots which mark the surface,\r\nand their relative position, with a less power than 130, 160, or 200\r\ntimes; and even with such powers, persons not much accustomed to look\r\nthrough telescopes, find a difficulty in distinguishing them.\r\n\r\nThe strongest and most prominent _belts of Jupiter_, may be seen with\r\na power of about 45; which power may be put upon a 20-inch achromatic,\r\nor a 1 foot reflector. But a satisfactory view of all the belts, and\r\nthe relative positions they occupy, cannot be obtained with much\r\nlower powers than 80, 100, or 140. The most common positions of these\r\nbelts are--one dark and well-defined belt to the south of Jupiter’s\r\nequator; another of nearly the same description to the north of it,\r\nand one about his north and his south polar circles. These polar belts\r\nare much more faint, and consequently not so easily distinguished as\r\nthe equatorial belts. The _moons_ of this planet, in a very clear\r\nnight, may sometimes be seen with a pocket 1 foot achromatic glass,\r\nmagnifying about 15 or 16 times. Some people have pretended that they\r\ncould see some of these satellites with their naked eye; but this is\r\nvery doubtful, and it is probable that such persons mistook certain\r\nfixed stars which happened to be near Jupiter for his satellites. But,\r\nin order to have a clear and interesting view of these, powers of at\r\nleast 80 or 100 times should be used. In order to perceive their\r\nimmersions into the shadow of Jupiter, and the exact moment of their\r\nemersions from it, a telescope not less than a 44 inch achromatic, with\r\na power of 150 should be employed. When these satellites are viewed\r\nthrough large telescopes with high magnifying powers, they appear\r\nwith well defined disks, like small planets. The planet Jupiter has\r\ngenerally been considered as a good test by which to try telescopes\r\nfor celestial purposes. When it is near the meridian and at a high\r\naltitude, if its general surface, its belts, and its margin appear\r\ndistinct and well-defined, it forms a strong presumptive evidence that\r\nthe instrument is a good one.\r\n\r\nThe planet _Saturn_ forms one of the most interesting objects for\r\ntelescopic observation. The _ring_ of Saturn may be _seen_ with a power\r\nof 45; but it can only be contemplated with advantage when powers\r\nof 100, 150, and 200 are applied to a 3 or a 5 feet achromatic. The\r\n_belts of Saturn_ are not to be seen distinctly with an achromatic\r\nof less than 2-3/4 inches aperture, or a Gregorian reflector of less\r\nthan 4 inches aperture, nor with a less magnifying power than 100\r\ntimes. Sir W. Herschel has drawn this planet with five belts across\r\nits disk; but it is seldom that above one or two of them can be seen\r\nby moderate-sized telescopes and common observers. The _division_\r\nof the double ring, when the planet is in a favorable position for\r\nobservation, and in a high altitude, may sometimes be perceived with\r\na 44-inch achromatic, with an aperture of 2-3/4 inches, and with\r\npowers of 150 or 180, but higher powers and larger instruments are\r\ngenerally requisite to perceive this phenomenon distinctly; and even\r\nwhen a portion of it is seen at the extremities of the _ansæ_, the\r\ndivision cannot, in every case, be traced along the whole of the\r\nhalf-circumference of the ring which is presented to our eye. Mr.\r\nHadley’s engraving of Saturn, in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’\r\nfor 1723, though taken with a Newtonian reflector with a power of\r\n228, represents the division of the ring as seen only on the ansæ or\r\nextremities of the elliptic figure in which the ring appears. The\r\nbest period for observing this division is when the ring appears at\r\nits utmost width. In this position it was seen in 1840, and it will\r\nappear nearly in the same position in 1855. When the ring appears like\r\na very narrow ellipse, a short time previous to its disappearance, the\r\ndivision, or dark space between the rings, cannot be seen by ordinary\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\nSir W. Herschel very properly observes, ‘There is not perhaps another\r\nobject in the heavens that presents us with such a variety of\r\nextraordinary phenomena as the planet Saturn; a magnificent globe,\r\nencompassed by a stupendous double ring; attended by seven satellites;\r\nornamented with equatorial belts; compressed at the poles; turning upon\r\nits axis; mutually eclipsing its ring and satellites, and eclipsed by\r\nthem; the most distant of the rings also turning upon its axis, and the\r\nsame taking place with the farthest of the satellites; all the parts\r\nof the system of Saturn occasionally reflecting light on each other;\r\nthe rings and moons illuminating the nights of the Saturnian, the globe\r\nand satellites enlightening the dark parts of the ring; and the planet\r\nand rings throwing back the sun’s beams upon the moons, when they are\r\ndeprived of them at the time of their conjunctions.’ This illustrious\r\nastronomer states, that with a new 7 feet mirror of extraordinary\r\ndistinctness he examined this planet, and found that the ring reflects\r\nmore light than the body, and with a power of 570 the colour of the\r\nbody becomes yellowish, while that of the ring remains more white. On\r\nMarch 11, 1780, he tried the powers of 222, 332, and 440 successively,\r\nand found the light of Saturn less intense than that of the ring; the\r\ncolour of the body turning, with the high powers, to a kind of yellow\r\nwhite, while that of the ring still remained white.\r\n\r\nMost of the _satellites_ of Saturn are difficult to be perceived\r\nwith ordinary telescopes, excepting the 4th, which may be seen with\r\npowers of from 60 to 100 times. It was discovered by Huygens in 1655,\r\nby means of a common refracting telescope 12 feet long, which might\r\nmagnify about 70 times. The next in brightness to this is the 5th\r\nsatellite, which Cassini discovered in 1671, by means of a 17 feet\r\nrefractor, which might carry a power of above 80 times. The 3rd was\r\ndiscovered by the same astronomer in 1672, by a longer telescope; and\r\nthe 1st and 2nd, in 1684, by means of two excellent object-glasses of\r\n100 and 136 feet, which might have magnified from 200 to 230 times.\r\nThey were afterwards seen by two other glasses of 70 and 90 feet, made\r\nby Campani, and sent from Rome to the Royal Observatory at Paris, by\r\nthe King’s order, after the discovery of the 3rd and 5th satellites.\r\nIt is asserted, however, that all those 5 satellites were afterwards\r\nseen with a telescope of 34 feet, with an aperture of 3-3/10 inches,\r\nwhich would magnify about 120 times. These satellites, on the whole,\r\nexcept the 4th and 5th, are not easily detected. Dr. Derham, who\r\nfrequently viewed Saturn through Huygens’ glass of 126 feet focal\r\nlength, declares, in the preface to his ‘Astro-Theology,’ that he could\r\nnever perceive above 3 of the satellites. Sir W. Herschel observes,\r\nthat the visibility of these minute and extremely faint objects,\r\ndepends more on the _penetrating_ than upon the _magnifying_ power\r\nof our telescopes; and that with a 10 feet Newtonian, charged with\r\na magnifying power of only 60, he saw all the 5 old satellites; but\r\nthe 6th and 7th, which were discovered and were easily seen with his\r\n40-feet telescope, and were also visible in his 20-feet instrument,\r\nwere not discernible in the 7 or the 10-feet telescopes, though all\r\nthat _magnifying power_ can do may be done as well with the 7-feet as\r\nwith any larger instrument. Speaking of the 7th satellite, he says,\r\n‘Even in my 40-feet reflector it appears no bigger than a very small\r\nlucid point. I see it, however, very well in the 20-feet reflector; to\r\nwhich the exquisite figure of the speculum not a little contributes.’\r\nA late observer asserts, that in 1825, with a 12-feet achromatic, of 7\r\ninches aperture, made by Tulley, with a power of 150, the 7 satellites\r\nwere easily visible, but not so easily with a power of 200; and that\r\nthe planet appeared as bright as brilliantly burnished silver, and the\r\ndivision in the ring and a belt were very plainly distinguished, with a\r\npower of 200.\r\n\r\nThe planet _Uranus_, being generally invisible to the naked eye, is\r\nseldom an object of attention to common observers. A considerable\r\nmagnifying power is requisite to make it appear in a planetary form\r\nwith a well-defined disk. The best periods for detecting it are, when\r\nit is near its opposition to the sun, or when it happens to approximate\r\nto any of the other planets, or to a well-known fixed star. When none\r\nof these circumstances occur, its position requires to be pointed out\r\nby an Equatorial Telescope. On the morning of the 25th January, 1841,\r\nthis planet happened to be in conjunction with Venus, at which time\r\nit was only 4 minutes north of that planet. Several days before this\r\nconjunction, I made observations on Uranus. On the evening of the\r\n24th, about 8 hours before the conjunction, the two planets appeared\r\nin the same field of the telescope, the one exceedingly splendid, and\r\nthe other more obscure, but distinct and well-defined. Uranus could\r\nnot be perceived, either with the naked eye, or with an opera glass;\r\nbut could be distinguished as a very small star by means of a pocket\r\nachromatic telescope magnifying about 14 times. It is questionable\r\nwhether, under the most favourable circumstances, this planet can ever\r\nbe distinguished by the naked eye. With magnifying powers of 30 and 70,\r\nit appeared as a moderately large star with a steady light, but without\r\nany sensible disk. With powers of 120, 180, and 250, it presented a\r\nround and pretty well-defined disk, but not so luminous and distinct as\r\nit would have done in a higher altitude.\r\n\r\nThe _Double Stars_ require a great _variety_ of powers, in order to\r\ndistinguish the small stars that accompany the larger. Some of them\r\nare distinguished with moderate powers, while others require pretty\r\nlarge instruments, furnished with high magnifying eye-pieces. I shall\r\ntherefore select only a few as a specimen. The star _Castor_, or α\r\nGeminorum, may be easily seen to be double with powers of from 70 to\r\n100. I have sometimes seen these stars, which are nearly equal in size\r\nand colour, with a terrestrial power of 44 on a 44-inch achromatic. The\r\nappearance of this star with such powers is somewhat similar to that\r\nof η Coronæ in a 7 feet achromatic, of 5 inches aperture, with a power\r\nof 500. γ Andromedæ may be seen with a moderate power. In a 30-inch\r\nachromatic of 2 inches aperture, and a power of 80, it appears like\r\nε Bootis, when seen in a 5-feet achromatic, with a power of 460. This\r\nstar is said to be visible even in a 1-foot achromatic with a power of\r\n35. ε _Lyræ_, which is a quintuple star, but appears to the naked eye\r\nas a single star,--may be seen to be double with a power of from 6 to\r\n12 time. γ _Leonis_ is visible in a 44-inch achromatic, with a power of\r\n180 or 200. _Rigel_ in a 3-1/2-feet achromatic, may be seen with powers\r\nvarying from 130 to 200. The small star, however, which accompanies\r\nRigel, is sometimes difficult to be perceived, even with such powers.\r\nε _Bootis_ is seldom distinctly defined with an achromatic of less\r\naperture than 3-1/4 inches, or a reflector of less than 5 inches, with\r\na power of at least 250.\r\n\r\nThese and similar stars are not to be expected to be seen equally well\r\nat all times, even when the magnifying and illuminating powers are\r\nproperly proportioned; as much depends upon the state of the weather,\r\nand the pureness of the atmosphere. In order to perceive the closest\r\nof the double stars, Sir W. Herschel recommends, that the power of the\r\ntelescope should be adjusted upon a star known to be single, of nearly\r\nthe same altitude, magnitude, and colour with the double star which\r\nis to be observed, or upon one star above and another below it. Thus,\r\nthe late Mr. Aubert, the astronomer, could not see the two stars of γ\r\nLeonis, when the focus was adjusted upon that star itself; but he soon\r\nobserved the small star, after he had adjusted the focus upon Regulus.\r\nAn exact adjustment of the focus of the instrument is indispensably\r\nrequisite, in order to perceive such minute objects.\r\n\r\nIn viewing the _Nebulæ_, and the very small and immensely distant\r\nfixed stars, which require much light to render them visible, a large\r\naperture of the object-glass or speculum, which admits of a great\r\nquantity of light, is of more importance than high magnifying powers.\r\nIt is light chiefly, accompanied with a moderate magnifying power,\r\nthat enables us to _penetrate_ into the distant regions of space. Sir\r\nW. Herschel, when sweeping the profundities of the Milky way, and the\r\nHand and Club of Orion, used a telescope of the Newtonian form, 20-feet\r\nfocal length, and 18-7/10 inches diameter, with a power of only 157.\r\nOn applying this telescope and power to a part of the _Via Lactea_, he\r\nfound that it completely resolved the whole whitish appearance into\r\nstars, which his former telescopes had not light enough to effect; and\r\nwhich smaller instruments with much higher magnifying powers would\r\nnot have effected. He tells us, that with this power, ‘the glorious\r\nmultitude of stars,’ in the vicinity of Orion, ‘of all possible sizes,\r\nthat presented themselves to view, was truly astonishing, and that\r\nhe had fields which contained 70, 90 and 110 stars, so that a belt\r\nof 15 degrees long, and 2 degrees broad, which passed through the\r\nfield of the telescope in an hour, could not contain less than fifty\r\nthousand stars that were large enough to be distinctly numbered.’ In\r\nviewing the Milky way, the Nebulæ, and small clusters of stars, such\r\nas _Præsepe_ in Cancer, I generally use a power of 55 times, on an\r\nachromatic telescope 6 feet 6 inches in focal length, and 4 inches\r\ndiameter. The eye-piece, which produces this power--which I formed\r\nfor the purpose--consists of two convex lenses, the one next the eye\r\n3 inches focal length, and 1-2/10 inch diameter, and that next the\r\nobject 3-1/2 inches focus, and 1-4/10 inch diameter, the deepest convex\r\nsurfaces being next each other, and their distance 1/4 inch. With this\r\neye-piece a very large and brilliant field of view is obtained; and I\r\nfind it preferable to any higher powers in viewing the nebulosities,\r\nand clusters of stars. In certain spaces of the heavens, it sometimes\r\npresents in one field, nearly a hundred stars. It likewise serves to\r\nexhibit a very clear and interesting view of the full moon.\r\n\r\nIn observing _Comets_, a very small power should generally be used,\r\neven on large instruments. These bodies possess so small a quantity\r\nof light, and they are so frequently enveloped in a veil of dense\r\natmosphere, that _magnifying_ power sometimes renders them more\r\nobscure; and therefore the _illuminating_ power of a large telescope,\r\nwith a small power, is in all cases to be preferred. A comet eye-piece\r\nshould be constructed with a very large and uniformly distinct field,\r\nand should magnify only from 15 to 30 or 40 times, and the lenses of\r\nsuch an eye-tube should be nearly two inches in diameter. The late\r\nRev. F. Wollaston recommended for observing comets, ‘a telescope with\r\nan achromatic object-glass of 16 inches focal length, and 2 inches\r\naperture, with a Ramsden’s eye-glass magnifying about 25 times, mounted\r\non a very firm equatorial stand, the field of view taking in 2 degrees\r\nof a great circle.’\r\n\r\nIn viewing the _moon_, various powers may be applied according to\r\ncircumstances. The best periods of the moon for inspecting the\r\ninequalities on its surface, are either when it assumes a crescent or\r\na half-moon phase, or two or three days after the period of half-moon.\r\nSeveral days after full-moon, and particularly about the third quarter,\r\nwhen this orb is waning, and when the shadows of its mountains and\r\nvales are thrown in a different direction from what they are when\r\non the increase,--the most prominent and interesting views may be\r\nobtained. The most convenient season for obtaining such views is during\r\nthe autumnal months, when the moon, about the third quarter, sometimes\r\nrises as early as 8 o’clock P.M., and may be viewed at a\r\nconsiderably high altitude by ten or eleven. When in the positions now\r\nalluded to, and at a high altitude, very high magnifying powers may\r\nsometimes be applied with good effect, especially if the atmosphere be\r\nclear and serene. I have sometimes applied a power, in such cases, of\r\n350 times, on a 46-inch achromatic, with considerable distinctness;\r\nbut it is only two or three times in a year, and when the atmosphere\r\nis remarkably favourable, that such a power can be used. The autumnal\r\nevenings are generally best fitted for such observations. The _full\r\nmoon_ is an object which is never seen to advantage with high powers,\r\nas no shadows or inequalities on its surface can then be perceived.\r\nIt forms, however, a very beautiful object, when magnifying powers\r\nnot higher than 40, 50, or 60 times are used. A power of 45 times, if\r\nproperly constructed, will show the _whole of the moon_ with a margin\r\naround it, when the darker and brighter parts of its surface will\r\npresent a variegated aspect, and appear somewhat like a map to the eye\r\nof the observer.\r\n\r\n4. _Mode of exhibiting the Solar spots._\r\n\r\nThe solar spots may be contemplated with advantage by magnifying powers\r\nvarying from 60 to 180 times; about 90 times is a good medium power,\r\nthough they may sometimes be distinguished with very low powers, such\r\nas those usually adapted to a one-foot telescope, or even by means of a\r\ncommon opera-glass. The common astronomical eye-pieces given along with\r\nachromatic telescopes, and the sun-glasses connected with them, are\r\ngenerally ill-adapted for taking a pleasant and comprehensive view of\r\nthe solar spots. In the higher magnifying powers, the first eye-glass\r\nis generally at too great a distance from the eye, and the sun-glass\r\nwhich is screwed over it, removes it to a still greater distance from\r\nthe point to which the eye is applied, so that not above one third\r\nof the field of view can be taken in. This circumstance renders it\r\ndifficult to point the instrument to any particular small spot on the\r\nsolar disk which we wish minutely to inspect; and besides, it prevents\r\nus from taking a comprehensive view of the _relative positions_ of\r\nall the spots that may at any time be traversing the disk. To obviate\r\nthis inconvenience, the sun-glass would require to be placed so near\r\nto the glass next the eye as almost to touch it. But this is sometimes\r\ndifficult to be attained, and, in high powers, even the thickness of\r\nthe sun-glass itself is sufficient to prevent the eye from taking in\r\nthe whole field of view. For preventing the inconveniences to which\r\nI now allude, I generally make use of a _terrestrial_ eye-piece of a\r\nconsiderable power, with a large field, the sun-glass is fixed at the\r\nend of a short tube which slides on the eye-piece, and permits the\r\ncoloured glass to approach within a line or two of the lens next the\r\neye, so that the whole field of the telescope is completely secured.\r\nThe eye-piece alluded to carries a magnifying power of 95 times for\r\na 46-inch telescope, and takes in about three fourths of the surface\r\nof the sun, so that the relative positions of all the spots may\r\ngenerally be perceived at one view. Such a power is, in most cases,\r\nquite sufficient for ordinary observations; and I have seldom found any\r\ngood effect to arise from attempting very high powers, when minutely\r\nexamining the solar spots.\r\n\r\nBut, the most pleasant mode of viewing the solar spots--especially when\r\nwe wish to exhibit them to others--is to throw the image of the sun\r\nupon a white screen, placed in a room which is considerably darkened.\r\nIt is difficult, however, when the sun is at a high altitude, to put\r\nthis method into practice, on account of the great obliquity with\r\nwhich his rays then fall, which prevents a screen from being placed\r\nat any considerable distance from the eye-end of the telescope. The\r\nfollowing plan, therefore, is that which I uniformly adopt as being\r\nboth the easiest and the most satisfactory. A telescope is placed in a\r\nconvenient position, so as to be directed to the sun. This telescope\r\nis furnished with a _diagonal eye-piece_, such as that represented,\r\nfig. 77, (p. 344.) The window-shutters of the apartment are all closed,\r\nexcepting a space sufficient to admit the solar rays; and, when the\r\ntelescope is properly adjusted, a beautiful image of the sun, with\r\nall the spots which then happen to diversify his surface, is thrown\r\nupon the _ceiling_ of the room. This image may be from 12 to 20, or 30\r\ninches or more in diameter, according to the distance of the ceiling\r\nfrom the diagonal eye-piece. The greater this distance is, the larger\r\nthe image. If the sun is at a very high altitude, the image will be\r\nelliptical; if he be at no great distance from the horizon, the image\r\nwill appear circular or nearly so; but in either case the spots will be\r\ndistinctly depicted, provided the focus of the telescope be accurately\r\nadjusted. In this exhibition, the apparent motion of the sun, produced\r\nby the rotation of the earth, and the passage of thin fleeces of clouds\r\nacross the solar disk, exhibit a very pleasing appearance.\r\n\r\nBy this mode of viewing the solar spots we may easily ascertain their\r\ndiameter and magnitude, at least to a near approximation. We have only\r\nto take a scale of inches, and measure the diameter of any well-defined\r\nand remarkable spot, and then the diameter of the solar image; and,\r\ncomparing the one with the other, we can ascertain the number of miles\r\neither lineal or square, comprehended in the dimensions of the spot.\r\nFor example, suppose a spot to measure one half-inch in diameter,\r\nand the whole image of the sun 25 inches, the proportion between\r\nthe diameter of the spot and that of the sun will be as 1 to 50, in\r\nother words, the _one fiftieth_ part of the sun’s diameter. Now, this\r\ndiameter being 880,000 miles, this number, divided by 50, produces a\r\nquotient of 17,600 = the number of miles which its diameter measures.\r\nSuch a spot will therefore contain an area of 243,285,504, or more\r\nthan two hundred and forty-three millions of square miles, which is 46\r\nmillions of miles more than the whole superficies of the terraquous\r\nglobe. Again, suppose the diameter of a spot measures 3/10 inch, and\r\nthe solar image 23 inches, the proportion of the diameter of the spot\r\nto that of the sun is as 3 to 230 = the number of tenths in 23 inches.\r\nThe number of miles in the spot’s diameter will therefore be found\r\nby the following proportion: 230 : 880,000 :: 3 : 11,478; that is,\r\nthe diameter of such a spot measures eleven thousand four hundred and\r\nseventy-eight miles. Spots of such sizes are not unfrequently seen to\r\ntransit the solar disk.\r\n\r\nBy this mode of viewing the image of the sun, his spots may be\r\nexhibited to twenty or thirty individuals at once without the least\r\nstraining or injury to the eyes; and as no separate screen is\r\nrequisite, and as the ceilings of rooms are generally white, the\r\nexperiment may be performed in half a minute without any previous\r\npreparation, except screwing on and adjusting the eye-piece. The manner\r\nof exhibiting the solar spots, in this way, is represented in fig. 82.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 82._]\r\n\r\n5. _On the space-penetrating power of telescopes._--The power of\r\ntelescopes to penetrate into the profundity of space is the result of\r\nthe quantity of light they collect and send to the eye in a state fit\r\nfor vision. This property of telescopes is sometimes designated by the\r\nexpression _Illuminating Power_.\r\n\r\nSir W. Herschel appears to have been the first who made a distinction\r\nbetween the _magnifying_ power, and the _space-penetrating_ power\r\nof a telescope; and there are many examples which prove that such\r\na distinction ought to be made, especially in the case of large\r\ninstruments. For example, the small star, or speck of light, which\r\naccompanies the pole-star, may be seen through a telescope of large\r\naperture, with a smaller magnifying power than with a telescope of a\r\nsmall aperture furnished with a much higher power. If the magnifying\r\npower is sufficient to show the small star completely separated from\r\nthe rays which surround the large one, this is sufficient in one point\r\nof view; but in order that this effect may be produced, so as to render\r\nthe small star perfectly distinguishable, a certain quantity of light\r\nmust be admitted into the pupil of the eye--which quantity depends\r\nupon the area of the object-glass or speculum of the instrument, or,\r\nin other words, on the illuminating power. If we compare a telescope\r\nof 2-3/4 inches aperture with one of 5 inches aperture, when the\r\nmagnifying power of each does not exceed 50 times for terrestrial\r\nobjects, the effect of illuminating power is not so evident; but\r\nif we use a power of 100 for day objects, and 180 for the heavenly\r\nbodies, the effects of illuminating power is so clearly perceptible,\r\nthat objects not only appear brighter, and more clearly visible, in\r\nthe larger telescope, but with the same magnifying power, they also\r\n_appear_ larger, particularly when the satellites of Jupiter and small\r\nstars are the objects we are viewing.\r\n\r\nSir W. Herschel remarks, that ‘objects are viewed in their greatest\r\nperfection, when, in penetrating space, the magnifying power is so\r\nlow as only to be sufficient to show the object well--and when,\r\nin magnifying objects, by way of examining them minutely, the\r\nspace-penetrating power is no higher than what will suffice for the\r\npurpose; for in the use of either power, the injudicious overcharge\r\nof the other will prove hurtful to vision.’ When illuminating power is\r\nin too high a degree, the eye is offended by the extreme brightness of\r\nthe object. When it is in too low a degree, the eye is distressed by\r\nits endeavours to see what is beyond its reach; and therefore it is\r\ndesirable, when we wish to give the eye all the assistance possible, to\r\nhave the illuminating and the magnifying powers in due proportion. What\r\nthis proportion is, depends, in a certain degree, upon the brightness\r\nof the object. In proportion to its brightness or luminosity, the\r\nmagnifying power may, to a certain extent, be increased. Sir W.\r\nHerschel remarks, in reference to α Lyræ, ‘This star, I surmise, has\r\nlight enough to bear being magnified, at least a hundred thousand\r\ntimes, with no more than six inches of aperture.’ However beautifully\r\nperfect any telescopes may appear, and however sharp their _defining_\r\npower, their performance is limited by their illuminating powers--which\r\nare as the squares of the diameters of the apertures of the respective\r\ninstruments. Thus, a telescope whose object-glass is 4 inches diameter\r\nwill have four times the quantity of light, or illuminating power,\r\npossessed by a telescope whose aperture is only 2 inches, or in the\r\nproportion of 16 to 4,--the square of 4 being 16, and the square of 2\r\nbeing 4.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the _space-penetrating power_, to which we are\r\nadverting, and the distinction between it, and magnifying power,\r\nmay be illustrated from a few examples taken from Sir W. Herschel’s\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nThe first observation which I shall notice refers to the _nebula_\r\nbetween η and ζ Ophiuchi, discovered by Messier in 1764. The\r\nobservation was made with a 10 feet reflector, having a magnifying\r\npower of 250, and a space-penetrating power of 28.67. His note is dated\r\nMay 3, 1783. ‘I see several stars in it, and make no doubt a higher\r\npower and more light will resolve it all into stars. This seems to me\r\na good nebula for the purpose of establishing the connection between\r\nnebulæ and clusters of stars in general.’--‘June 18, 1784. The same\r\nnebula viewed with a Newtonian 20 feet reflector; penetrating power 61,\r\nand a magnifying power of 157; a very large and a very bright cluster\r\nof excessively compressed stars. The stars are but just visible, and\r\nare of unequal magnitudes. The large stars are red, the cluster is a\r\nminiature of that near Flamstead’s forty-second Comæ Berenices; Right\r\nascension 17^h 6^m 32^s Polar distance 108° 18´´’ In this case, a\r\npenetrating power of about 28, with a magnifying power of 250, barely\r\nshewed a few stars; when in the second instrument the illuminating\r\npower of 60 with the magnifying power of only 157 showed them\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nSubsequently to the date of the latter observation, the 20 feet\r\nNewtonian telescope was converted into an Herschelian instrument, by\r\ntaking away the small speculum, and giving the large one the proper\r\ninclination for obtaining the front view; by which alteration the\r\nilluminating power was increased from 61 to 75, and the advantage\r\nderived from the alteration was evident in the discovery of the\r\nsatellites of Uranus by the altered telescope, which before was\r\nincompetent in the point of penetration, or illuminating power. ‘March\r\n14, 1798, I viewed the Georgian planet (or Uranus) with a new 25 feet\r\nreflector. Its penetrating power is 95.85, and having just before\r\nalso viewed it with my 20 feet instrument, I found that with an equal\r\nmagnifying power of 300, the 25 feet telescope had considerably the\r\nadvantage of the former.’ The aperture of the 20 feet instrument was\r\n18.8 inches, and that of the 25 feet telescope, 24 inches, so that\r\nthe superior effect of the latter instrument must have been owing\r\nto its greater illuminating power. The following observations show\r\nthe superior power of the 40 feet telescope as compared with the 20\r\nfeet.--‘Feb. 24, 1786, I viewed the nebula near Flamstead’s fifth\r\nSerpentis, with my 20 feet reflector, magnifying power 157. The most\r\nbeautiful extremely compressed cluster of small stars; the greatest\r\npart of them gathered together into one brilliant nucleus, evidently\r\nconsisting of stars, surrounded with many detached gathering stars of\r\nthe same size and colour. R.A. 15^h 7^m 12^s. P.D. 87° 8´´’--‘May 27,\r\n1791, I viewed the same object with my 40 feet telescope, penetrating\r\npower 191.69, magnifying power 370. A beautiful cluster of stars. I\r\ncounted about 200 of them. The middle of it is so compressed, that\r\nit is impossible to distinguish the stars.’--‘Nov. 5, 1791, I viewed\r\nSaturn with the 20 and 40 feet telescopes. _Twenty feet._ The fifth\r\nsatellite of Saturn is very small. The first, second, third, fourth and\r\nfifth, and the new sixth satellites are in their calculated places.\r\n_Forty feet._ I see the new sixth satellite much better with this\r\ninstrument than with the 20 feet. The fifth is also much larger here\r\nthan in the 20 feet, in which it was nearly the same size as a small\r\nfixed star, but here it is considerably larger than that star.’\r\n\r\nThese examples, and many others of a similar kind, explain sufficiently\r\nthe nature and extent of that species of power that one telescope\r\npossesses over another, in consequence of its enlarged aperture; but\r\nthe exact quantity of this power is in some degree uncertain. To\r\nascertain practically the illuminating power of telescopes, we must\r\ntry them with equal powers on such objects as the following,--the\r\nsmall stars near the pole-star, and near Rigel and ε Bootis--the\r\ndivision in the ring of Saturn--and distant objects in the twilight or\r\ntowards the evening. These objects are distinctly seen with a 5 feet\r\nachromatic of 3-8/10 inches aperture, and an illuminating power of\r\n144, while they are scarcely visible in a 3-1/2 feet with an aperture\r\nof 2-3/4 inches, and an illuminating power of 72, supposing the same\r\nmagnifying power to be applied. The illuminating power of a telescope\r\nis best estimated, in regard to land objects, when it is tried on\r\nminute objects, and such as are badly lighted up; and the advantage\r\nof a telescope with a large aperture will be most obvious, when it is\r\ncompared with another of inferior size in the close of the evening,\r\nwhen looking at a printed bill composed of letters of various sizes. As\r\ndarkness comes on, the use of illuminating power becomes more evident.\r\nIn a 5 feet telescope some small letters will be legible, which are\r\nhardly discernible in the 3-1/2 feet, and in the 2-1/2 feet are quite\r\nundefinable, though the magnifying powers be equal. Sir W. Herschel\r\ninforms us, that in the year 1776, when he had erected a telescope of\r\n20 feet focal length of the Newtonian construction, one of its effects\r\nby trial was, that when towards evening, on account of darkness, the\r\nnatural eye could not penetrate far into space, the telescope possessed\r\nthat power sufficiently to show, by the dial of a distant church\r\nsteeple, what o’clock it was, notwithstanding the naked eye could no\r\nlonger see the steeple itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to convey an idea of the _numbers_ by which the degree of\r\nspace-penetrating power is expressed, and the general grounds on which\r\nthey rest, the following statements may be made. The depth to which the\r\nnaked eye can penetrate into the spaces of the heavens, is considered\r\nas extending to the twelfth order of distances--in other words, it can\r\nperceive a star at a distance 12 times farther than those luminaries,\r\nsuch as Sirius, Arcturus or Capella, which, from their vivid light, we\r\npresume to be nearest to us. It has been stated above, that Herschel\r\ncalculated his 10 feet telescope to have a space-penetrating power of\r\n28.67, that is, it could enable us to descry a star 28 times farther\r\ndistant than the naked eye can reach. His 20 feet Newtonian was\r\nconsidered as having a similar power of 61; his 25 feet, nearly 96, and\r\nhis 40 feet instrument, a power of 191.69. If each of these numbers\r\nbe multiplied by 12, the product will indicate how much farther these\r\ntelescopes will penetrate into space than the nearest range of the\r\nfixed stars, such as those of the first magnitude. For instance, the\r\npenetrating power of the 40 feet reflector being 191.69, this number\r\nmultiplied by 12, gives a product of 2,300, which shows, that were\r\nthere a series of two thousand three hundred stars extended in a line\r\nbeyond Sirius, Capella and similar stars--each star separated from the\r\none beyond it, by a space equal to the distance of Sirius from the\r\nearth--they might be all seen through the 40 feet telescope. In short,\r\nthe penetrating power of telescopes is a circumstance which requires\r\nto be particularly attended to in our observations of celestial\r\nphenomena, and in many cases, is of more importance than _magnifying_\r\npower. It is the effect produced by illuminating power that renders\r\ntelescopes, furnished with comparatively small magnifying powers, much\r\nmore efficient in observing comets and certain nebulæ and clusters of\r\nstars, than when high powers are attempted. Every telescope may be so\r\nadjusted, as to produce different space-penetrating powers. If we wish\r\nto diminish such a power, we have only to contract the object-glass or\r\nspeculum, by placing circular rims, or apertures of different degrees\r\nof breadth, across the mouth of the great tube of the instrument. But\r\nwe cannot increase this illuminating power beyond a certain extent,\r\nwhich is limited by the diameter of the object-glass. When we wish\r\nilluminating power beyond this limit, we must be furnished with an\r\nobject-glass or speculum of a larger size; and hence, the rapid advance\r\nin price of instruments which have large apertures, and consequently\r\nhigh illuminating powers. Mr. Tulley’s 3-1/2 feet achromatics of 2-3/4\r\ninches aperture, sell at £26 5s. When the aperture is 3-1/4 inches, the\r\nprice is £42. When 3-3/4 inches, £68 5s.

The following directions may perhaps be\r\nuseful to the reader in directing him in the choice of an achromatic\r\nrefracting telescope.\r\n\r\nSupposing that an achromatic telescope of 3-1/2 feet focal length, and\r\n3-1/4 inches aperture were offered for sale, and that it were required\r\nto ascertain whether the object-glass, on which its excellence chiefly\r\ndepends--is a good one and duly adjusted;--some opinion may be formed\r\nby laying the tube of the telescope in a horizontal position, on a\r\nfirm support, about the height of the eye,--and by placing a printed\r\ncard or a watch glass vertically, but in an inverted position, against\r\nsome wall or pillar, at 40 or 50 yards distant, so as to be exposed\r\nto a clear sky. When the telescope is directed to this object, and\r\naccurately adjusted to the eye--should the letters on the card, or the\r\nstrokes and dots on the watch-glass appear clearly and sharply defined,\r\nwithout any mistiness or coloration, and if very small points appear\r\nwell defined--great hopes may be entertained that the glass will turn\r\nout a good one. But a telescope may appear a good one, when viewing\r\ncommon terrestrial objects, to eyes unaccustomed to discriminate\r\ndeviations from perfect vision, while it may turn out to be an\r\nindifferent one, when directed to certain celestial objects. Instead\r\ntherefore of a printed card, fix a black board, or one half of a sheet\r\nof black paper, in a vertical position at the same distance, and a\r\ncircular disk of white writing paper, about 1/4 of an inch in diameter,\r\non the centre of the black ground. Then having directed the telescope\r\nto this object, and adjusted for the place of distinct vision, mark\r\nwith a black-lead pencil the sliding eye-tube, at the end of the main\r\ntube, so that this position can always be known; and if this sliding\r\ntube be gradually drawn out, or pushed in, while the eye beholds the\r\ndisk, it will gradually enlarge and lose its colour, till its edges\r\ncease to be well-defined. Now, if the enlarged misty circle is observed\r\nto be concentric with the disk itself, the object-glass is properly\r\ncentered, as it has reference to the tube; but if the misty circle goes\r\nto one side of the disk, the cell of the object-glass is not at right\r\nangles to the tube, and must have its screws removed and its holes\r\nelongated, by a rattailed file, small enough to enter the holes. When\r\nthis has been done, the cell may be replaced, and the disk examined a\r\nsecond time, and a slight stroke on one edge of the cell, by a wooden\r\nmallet, will show by the alteration made in the position of the misty\r\nportion of the disk, how the adjustment is to be effected, which is\r\nknown to be right when a motion in the sliding tube will make the\r\ndiluted disk enlarge in a circle concentric with the disk itself. When\r\nthe disk will enlarge so as to make a ring of diluted white light round\r\nits circumference, as the sliding tube holding the eye-piece is pushed\r\nin or drawn out, the cell may be finally fixed by the screws passing\r\nthrough its elongated holes.\r\n\r\nWhen the object-glass is thus adjusted, it may then be ascertained\r\nwhether the curves of the respective lenses composing the object-glass\r\nare well-formed and suitable for each other. If a small motion of the\r\nsliding tube of about 1/10th of an inch in a 3-1/2 feet telescope, from\r\nthe point of distinct vision, will dilute the light of the disk and\r\nrender the appearance confused, the figure of the object-glass is good;\r\nparticularly if the same effect will take place at equal distances\r\nfrom the point of distinct vision, when the tube is alternately drawn\r\nout and pushed in. A telescope that will admit of much motion in the\r\nsliding tube without sensibly affecting the distinctness of vision,\r\nwill not define an object well at any point of adjustment, and must\r\nbe considered as having an imperfect object-glass, inasmuch as the\r\nspherical aberration of the transmitted rays is not duly corrected. The\r\ndue adjustment of the convex lens, or lenses, to the concave one, will\r\nbe judged of by the absence of coloration round the enlarged disk, and\r\nis a property distinct from the spherical aberration; the achromatism\r\ndepending on the relative focal distances of the convex and concave\r\nlenses, is regulated by the relative dispersive powers of the pieces\r\nof glass made use of; but the distinctness of vision depends on a good\r\nfigure of the computed curves that limit the focal distances. When an\r\nobject-glass is free from imperfection in both these respects, it may\r\nbe called a good glass for terrestrial purposes.\r\n\r\nIt still, however, remains to be determined how far such an\r\nobject-glass may be good for viewing a star or a planet, and can only\r\nbe known by actual observations on the heavenly bodies. When a good\r\ntelescope is directed to the moon or to Jupiter, the achromatism\r\nmay be judged of, by alternately pushing in, and drawing out the\r\neye-piece, from the place of distinct vision. In the former case, a\r\nring of purple will be formed round the edge; and in the latter, a\r\nring of light green, which is the central colour of the prismatic\r\nspectrum; for these appearances show, that the extreme colours red\r\nand violet are corrected. Again, if one part of a lens employed have\r\na different refractive power from another part of it, that is, if the\r\nflint-glass particularly is not homogeneous, a star of the first and\r\neven of the second magnitude will point out the natural defect by the\r\nexhibition of an irradiation, or what is called _a wing_, at one side,\r\nwhich no perfection of figure or of adjustment will banish, and the\r\ngreater the aperture the more liable is the evil to happen. Hence caps\r\nwith different apertures are usually supplied with large telescopes,\r\nthat the extreme parts of the glass may be cut off, in observations\r\nrequiring a round and well-defined image of the body observed.\r\n\r\nAnother method of determining the figure and quality of an object-glass\r\nis by first covering its centre by a circular piece of paper, as much\r\nas one half of its diameter, and adjusting it for distinct vision of a\r\ngiven object, such as the disk above mentioned, when the central rays\r\nare intercepted--and then trying if the focal length remains unaltered\r\nwhen the paper is taken away, and an aperture of the same size applied,\r\nso that the extreme rays may in their turn be cut off. If the vision\r\nremains equally distinct in both cases, without any new adjustment\r\nfor focal distance, the figure is good, and the spherical aberration\r\ncured, and it may be seen by viewing a star of the first magnitude\r\nsuccessively in both cases, whether the irradiation is produced more\r\nby the extreme or by the central parts of the glass. Or, in case the\r\none half be faulty and the other good, a semicircular aperture, by\r\nbeing turned gradually round in trial, will detect what semicircle\r\ncontains the defective portion of the glass; and if such portion should\r\nbe covered, the only inconvenience that would ensue, would be the loss\r\nof so much light as is thus excluded. When an object-glass produces\r\nradiations in a large star, it is unfit for the nicer observations of\r\nastronomy, such as viewing double stars of the first class. The smaller\r\na large star appears in any telescope, the better is the figure of the\r\nobject-glass, but if the image of the star be free from wings, the size\r\nof its disk is not an objection in practical observations.[30]\r\n\r\nSome opticians are in the habit of inserting a diaphragm into the\r\nbody of the large tube, to cut off the extreme rays coming from the\r\nobject-glass when the figure is not good, instead of lessening the\r\naperture by a cap. When this is the case, a deficiency of light will\r\nbe the consequence beyond what the apparent aperture warrants. It\r\nis therefore proper to examine that the diaphragm be not placed too\r\nnear the object-glass, so as to intercept any of the useful rays.\r\nSometimes a portion of the object-glass is cut off by the stop in\r\nthe eye-tube. To ascertain this, adjust the telescope to distinct\r\nvision, then take out the eye-glasses, and put your finger on some\r\nother object on the edge of the outside of the object-glass, and look\r\ndown the tube; if you can see the tip of your finger, or any object\r\nin its place, just peeping over the edge of the object-glass, no part\r\nis cut off. I once had a 3-1/2 feet telescope whose object-glass\r\nmeasured 3 inches diameter, which was neither so bright, nor did it\r\nperform in other respects nearly so well as another of the same length\r\nwhose object-glass was only 2-3/4 inches diameter; but I found that a\r\ndiaphragm was placed about a foot within the end of the large tube,\r\nwhich reduced the aperture of the object-glass to less than 2-1/2\r\ninches; and when it was removed the telescope was less distinct than\r\nbefore. The powers given along with this instrument were much lower\r\nthan usual--none of them exceeding 100 times. This is a trick not\r\nuncommon with some opticians.\r\n\r\nDr. Pearson mentions that an old Dollond’s telescope of 63 inches focal\r\nlength, and 3-3/4 inches aperture, supposed to be an excellent one,\r\nwas brought to Mr. Tulley, when he was present, and the result of the\r\nexamination was that its achromatism was not perfect. The imperfection\r\nwas thus determined by experiment. A small glass globe was placed at 40\r\nyards distance from the object-end of the telescope when the sun was\r\nshining, and the speck of light seen reflected from this globe formed a\r\ngood substitute for a large star, as an object to be viewed. When the\r\nfocal length of the object-glass was adjusted to this luminous object,\r\nno judgment could be formed of its prismatic aberrations, till the\r\neye-piece had been pushed in beyond the place of correct vision; but\r\nwhen the telescope was shortened a little, the luminous disk occasioned\r\nby such shortening was strongly tinged with _red_ rays at its\r\ncircumference. On the contrary, when the eye-piece was drawn out, so as\r\nto lengthen the telescope too much, the disk thus produced was tinged\r\nwith a small circle of _red_ at its _centre_, thereby denoting that\r\nthe convex lens had too short a focal length; and Mr. Tulley observed,\r\nthat if one or both of the curves of the convex lens were flattened\r\ntill the total focal length should be about 4 inches increased, it\r\nwould render the telescope quite achromatic, provided in doing this the\r\naberration should not be increased.\r\n\r\nThe following general remarks may be added. 1. To make anything\r\nlike an accurate comparison of telescopes, they must be tried not\r\nonly at the same place, but as nearly as possible at the same time,\r\nand, if the instruments are of the same length and construction,\r\nif possible, with the same eye-piece. 2. A difference of 8 or 10\r\ntimes in the magnifying power, will sometimes, on certain objects,\r\ngive quite a different character to a telescope. It has been found\r\nby various experiments that object-glasses of two or three inches\r\nlonger focus will produce different vision with the same eye-piece.\r\n3. Care must be taken to ascertain that the eye-glasses are perfectly\r\nclean and free from defects. The defects of glass are either from\r\nveins--specks--scratches--colour, or an incorrect figure. To discover\r\nveins in an eye or an object-glass, place a candle at the distance of\r\n4 or 5 yards; then look through the glass, and move it from your eye\r\ntill it appear full of light--you will then see every vein, or other\r\nimperfection in it which may distort the objects and render vision\r\nimperfect. Specks or scratches, especially in object-glasses, are not\r\nso injurious as veins, for they do not distort the object, but only\r\nintercept a portion of the light. 4. We cannot judge accurately of the\r\nexcellence of any telescope by observing objects with which we are\r\nnot familiarly acquainted. Opticians generally try an instrument at\r\ntheir own marks, such as the dial-plate of a watch, a finely engraved\r\ncard, a weather-cock, or the moon and the planet Jupiter, when near\r\nthe meridian. Of several telescopes of the same length, aperture and\r\nmagnifying power, that one is generally considered the best with which\r\nwe can read a given print at the greatest distance, especially if the\r\nprint consists of _figures_, such as a table of logarithms, where the\r\neye is not apt to be deceived by the imagination, in _guessing_ at the\r\nsense of a passage, when two or three words are distinguished.\r\n\r\nThere is a circumstance which I have frequently noticed, in reference\r\nto achromatic telescopes, particularly those of a small size, and which\r\nI have never seen noticed by any optical writer. It is this,--if the\r\ntelescope, when we are viewing objects, be gradually turned round its\r\naxis, there is a certain position in which the objects will appear\r\ndistinct and accurately defined; and if it be turned round exactly\r\na semicircle from this point, the same degree of distinctness is\r\nperceived; but in all other positions, there is an evident want of\r\nclearness and defining power. This I find to be the case in more than\r\nten 1 foot and 2 feet telescopes now in my possession; and therefore\r\nI have put marks upon the object-end of each of them, to indicate the\r\npositions in which they should be used for distinct observation.--This\r\nis a circumstance which requires, in many cases, to be attended to\r\nin the choice and the use of telescopical instruments, and in fixing\r\nand adjusting them on their pedestals. In some telescopes this defect\r\nis very striking, but it is in some measure perceptible in the great\r\nmajority of instruments which I have had occasion to inspect. Even in\r\nlarge and expensive achromatic telescopes this defect is sometimes\r\nobservable. I have an achromatic whose object-glass is 4-1/10 inches\r\ndiameter, which was much improved in its defining power, by being\r\nunscrewed from its original position, or turned round its axis--about\r\none-eighth part of its circumference. This defect is best detected by\r\nlooking at a large printed bill, or a sign-post at a distance, when, on\r\nturning round the telescope or object-glass, the letters will appear\r\nmuch better defined in one position than in another. The position in\r\nwhich the object appears least distinct is when the upper part of the\r\ntelescope is a quadrant of a circle different from the two positions\r\nabove-stated, or at an equal distance from each of them.\r\n\r\n7. _On the mode of determining the magnifying power of Telescopes._\r\n\r\nIn regard to refracting telescopes, we have already shown that, when a\r\nsingle eye-glass is used, the magnifying power may be found by dividing\r\nthe focal distance of the object-glass by that of the eye-glass. But\r\nwhen a Huygenian eye-piece, or a four-glass terrestrial eye-piece such\r\nas is now common in achromatic telescopes, is used, the magnifying\r\npower cannot be ascertained in this manner; and in some of the delicate\r\nobservations of practical astronomy, it is of the utmost importance\r\nto know the exact magnifying power of the instrument with which the\r\nobservations are made, particularly when micrometrical measurements\r\nare employed to obtain the desired results.--The following is a\r\ngeneral method of finding the magnifying powers of telescopes when the\r\ninstrument called a _dynameter_ is not employed; and it answers for\r\nrefracting and reflecting telescopes of every description.\r\n\r\nHaving put up a small circle of paper, an inch or two in diameter, at\r\nthe distance of about 100 yards, draw upon a card 2 black parallel\r\nlines, whose distance from each other is equal to the diameter of the\r\npaper circle. Then view through the telescope the paper circle with one\r\neye, and the parallel lines with the other; and let the parallel lines\r\nbe moved nearer to or further from, the eye, till they seem exactly\r\nto cover the small circle viewed through the telescope. The quotient\r\nobtained by dividing the distance of the paper circle by the distance\r\nof the parallel lines from the eye, will be the magnifying power of the\r\ntelescope. It requires a little practice before this experiment can\r\nbe performed with accuracy. The one eye must be accustomed to look at\r\nan object near at hand, while the other is looking at a more distant\r\nobject through the telescope. Both eyes must be open at the same time,\r\nand the image of the object seen through the telescope must be brought\r\ninto apparent contact with the real object near at hand. But a little\r\npractice will soon enable any observer to perform the experiment with\r\nease and correctness, if the telescope be mounted on a firm stand, and\r\nits elevation or depression produced by rack-work.\r\n\r\nThe following is another method, founded on the same\r\nprinciple:--Measure the space occupied by a number of the courses, or\r\nrows of bricks in a modern building--which, upon an average, is found\r\nto have 8 courses in 2 feet, so that each course or row, is 3 inches.\r\nThen cut a piece of paper 3 inches in height, and of the length of a\r\nbrick--which is about 9 inches--so that it may represent a brick, and\r\nfixing the paper against the brick wall, place the telescope to be\r\nexamined at the distance of about 80 or 100 yards from it. Now, looking\r\nthrough the telescope at the paper with one eye, and at the same time,\r\nwith the other eye, looking past the telescope, observe what extent of\r\nwall the magnified image of the paper appears to cover, then count the\r\ncourses of bricks in that extent, and it will give the magnifying power\r\nof the telescope. It is to be observed, however, that the magnifying\r\npower determined in this way, will be a fraction greater than for very\r\ndistant objects, as the focal distance of the telescope is necessarily\r\nlengthened in order to obtain distinct vision of near objects.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the magnifying powers of two telescopes, or of the same\r\ntelescope, when different magnifying powers are employed, I generally\r\nuse the following simple method. The telescopes are placed at 8 or 10\r\nfeet distant from a window, with their eye-ends parallel to each other,\r\nor at the same distance from the window. Looking at a distant object,\r\nI fix upon a portion of it whose magnified image will appear to fill\r\nexactly two or three panes of the window. Then putting on a different\r\npower, or looking through another telescope, I observe the same\r\nobject, and mark exactly the extent of its image on the window-panes,\r\nand compare the extent of the one image with the other. Suppose for\r\nexample, that the one telescope has been previously found to magnify\r\n90 times, and that the image of the object fixed upon exactly fills\r\nthree panes of the window, and that with the other power or the other\r\ntelescope, the image fills exactly two panes, then the magnifying power\r\nis equal to two thirds of the former, or 60 times; and were it to\r\nfill only one pane, the power would be about 30 times. A more correct\r\nmethod is to place at one side of the window, a narrow board, two or\r\nthree feet long, divided into 15 or 20 equal parts, and observe how\r\nmany of these parts appear to be covered by the respective images, of\r\nthe different telescopes. Suppose, in the one case, 10 divisions to be\r\ncovered by the image, in a telescope magnifying 90 times, and that the\r\nimage of the same object in another telescope, measures 6 divisions,\r\nthen its power is found by the following proportion, 10 : 90 : 6 : 54 :\r\nthat is, this telescope magnifies 54 times.\r\n\r\nAnother mode which I have used for determining, to a near\r\napproximation, the powers of telescopes, is as follows:--Endeavour\r\nto find the focus of a single lens which is exactly equivalent to\r\nthe magnifying power of the eye-piece, whether the Huygenian or the\r\ncommon terrestrial eye-piece. This may be done by taking a small lens,\r\nand using it as an object-glass to the eye-piece. Looking through\r\nthe eye-piece to a window and holding the lens at a proper distance,\r\nobserve whether the image of one of the panes exactly coincides with\r\nthe pane, as seen by the naked eye; if it does, then the magnifying\r\npower of the eye-piece is equal to that of the lens. If the lens be\r\n1/2 inch focal length, the eye-piece will produce the same magnifying\r\npower, as a single lens when used as an eye-glass to the telescope, and\r\nthe magnifying power will then be found by dividing the focal distance\r\nof the object-glass by that of the eye-glass. But if the image of\r\nthe pane of glass does not exactly coincide with the pane as seen by\r\nthe other eye, then proportional parts may be taken by observing the\r\ndivisions of such a board as described above, or we may try lenses of\r\ndifferent focal distances. Suppose, for example, that a lens 2 inches\r\nfocal length had been used, and that the image of a pane covered\r\nexactly the space of two panes, the power of the eye-piece is then\r\nequal to that of a single lens 1 inch focal distance.\r\n\r\nThe following is another mode depending on the same general principle.\r\nIf a slip of writing-paper one inch long, or a disk of the same\r\nmaterial of one inch diameter, be placed on a black ground at from\r\n30 to 50 yards distance from the object-end of the telescope, and a\r\nstaff painted white, and divided into inches and parts by strong black\r\nlines, be placed vertically near the said paper or disk; the eye that\r\nis directed through the telescope when adjusted for vision, will see\r\nthe magnified disk, and the other eye, looking along the outside of\r\nthe telescope, will observe the number of inches and parts that the\r\ndisk projected on it will just cover, and as many inches as are thus\r\ncovered will indicate the magnifying power of the telescope--at the\r\ndistance for which it is adjusted for distinct vision. The solar power,\r\nor powers for very distant objects, may be obtained by the following\r\nproportion:--As the terrestrial focal length, at the given distance:\r\nis to the solar focal length :: so is the terrestrial power, to the\r\nsolar power. For example, a disk of white paper one inch in diameter,\r\nwas placed on a black board, and suspended on a wall contiguous to a\r\nvertical black staff that was graduated into inches by strong white\r\nlines, at a distance of 33 yards 2-1/2 feet, and when the adjustment\r\nfor vision was made with a 42 inch telescope, the left eye of the\r\nobserver viewed the disk projected on the staff, while the right eye\r\nobserved that the enlarged image of the disk covered just 58-1/2 inches\r\non the staff, which number was the measure of the magnifying power,\r\nat the distance answering to 33 yards 2-1/2 feet--which in this case\r\nexceeded the solar focus by an inch and a half. Then according to the\r\nabove analogy, we have, as 43.5 : 42 :: 58.5 : 56.5 nearly. Hence the\r\nmagnifying power due to the solar focal length of the telescope in\r\nquestion is 56.5, and the distance 33 yards 2-1/2 feet, is that which\r\ncorresponds to an elongation of the solar focal distance an inch and a\r\nhalf.[31] If we multiply the terrestrial and the solar focal distances\r\ntogether, and divide the product by their difference, we shall again\r\nobtain the distance of the terrestrial object from the telescope. Thus,\r\n(43.5 + 42)/1.5 = 1218 inches = 101.5 feet, or 33 yards 2-1/2 feet.\r\n\r\nThe magnifying power of a telescope is also determined, by measuring\r\nthe image which the object-glass or the large speculum of a telescope\r\nforms at its solar focus. This is accomplished by means of an\r\ninstrument called a _Dynameter_. This apparatus consists of a strip of\r\nmother-of-pearl, marked with equal divisions, from the 1/100th to the\r\n1/1000th of an inch apart, according to the accuracy required. This\r\nmeasure is attached to a magnifying lens in its focus, in order to\r\nmake the small divisions more apparent. When the power of a telescope\r\nis required, the person must measure the clear aperture of the\r\nobject-glass, then holding the pearl _dynameter_ next the eye-glass,\r\nlet him observe how many divisions the small circle of light occupies,\r\nwhen the instrument is directed to a bright object. Then by dividing\r\nthe diameter of the object-glass by the diameter of this circle of\r\nlight, the power will be obtained.[32] The most accurate instrument\r\nof this kind is the _Double Image Dynameter_ invented by Ramsden,\r\nand another on the same principle now made by Dollond, a particular\r\ndescription of which may be found in Dr. Pearson’s ‘Introduction to\r\nPractical Astronomy.’ The advantage attending these dynameters is that\r\nthey do not require any knowledge of the thickness and focal lengths\r\nof any of the lenses employed in a telescope, nor yet of their number\r\nor relative positions; neither does it make any difference whether\r\nthe construction be refracting or reflecting, direct or inverting.\r\nOne operation includes the result arising from the most complicated\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nI shall only mention farther the following method of discovering the\r\nmagnifying power, which is founded on the same general principle as\r\nalluded to above. Let the telescope be placed in such a position\r\nopposite the sun, that the rays of light may fall perpendicularly on\r\nthe object-glass; and the pencil of rays may be received on a piece of\r\npaper, and its diameter measured. Then, as the diameter of the pencil\r\nof rays is to that of the object-glass, so is the magnifying power of\r\nthe telescope.\r\n\r\n8.--_On cleaning the lenses of telescopes._--\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, in order to distinct vision, that the glasses,\r\nparticularly the eye-glasses of telescopes be kept perfectly clean,\r\nfree of damp, dust, or whatever may impede the transmission of the\r\nrays of light. But great caution ought to be exercised in the wiping\r\nof them, as they are apt to be scratched, or otherwise injured by\r\na rough and incautious mode of cleaning them. They should never be\r\nattempted to be wiped unless they really require it; and, in this\r\ncase, they should be wiped carefully and gently with a piece of new\r\nand soft lamb’s-skin leather. If this be not at hand, a piece of fine\r\nsilk paper, or fine clean linen may be used as a substitute. The lens\r\nwhich requires to be most particularly attended to is the second glass\r\nfrom the eye, or the field-glass; for if any dust or other impediment\r\nbe found upon this glass, it is always distinctly seen, being magnified\r\nby the glass next the eye. The next glass which requires attention is\r\nthe fourth from the eye, or that which is next the object. Unless the\r\nglass next the eye be very dusty, a few small spots or grains of dust\r\nare seldom perceptible. The object-glass of an achromatic should seldom\r\nbe touched, unless damp adheres to it. Care should be taken never to\r\nuse pocket handkerchiefs or dirty rags for wiping lenses. From the\r\nfrequent use of such articles, the glasses of seaman’s telescopes get\r\ndimmed and scratched in in the course of a few years. If the glasses be\r\nexceedingly dirty, and if greasy substances are attached to them, they\r\nmay be soaked in spirits and water, and afterwards carefully wiped.\r\nIn replacing the glasses in their socket, care should be taken not\r\nto touch the surfaces with the fingers, as they would be dimmed with\r\nthe perspiration: they should be taken hold of by the edges only, and\r\ncarefully screwed into the same cells from which they were taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nON MEGALASCOPES, OR TELESCOPES FOR VIEWING VERY NEAR OBJECTS.\r\n\r\nIt appears to have been almost overlooked by opticians and others, that\r\ntelescopes may be constructed so as to exhibit a beautiful and minute\r\nview of very near objects, and to produce even a microscopic effect,\r\nwithout the least alteration in the _arrangement_ of the lenses of\r\nwhich they are composed. This object is effected simply by making the\r\neye-tube of a telescope of such a length as to be capable of being\r\ndrawn out 12 or 13 inches beyond the point of distinct vision for\r\ndistant objects. The telescope is then rendered capable of exhibiting\r\nwith distinctness all kinds of objects, from the most distant to those\r\nwhich are placed within 3 or 4 feet of the instrument--or not nearer\r\nthan double the focal distance of the object-glass. Our telescopes,\r\nhowever, are seldom or never fitted with tubes that slide farther than\r\nan inch or two beyond the point of distinct vision for distant objects,\r\nalthough a tube of a longer size than usual, or an additional tube\r\nwould cost but a very trifling expence.\r\n\r\nThe following, among many others, are some of the objects on which I\r\nhave tried many amusing experiments with telescopes fitted up with\r\nthe long tubes to which I allude. The telescope to which I shall\r\nmore particularly advert is an achromatic, mounted on a pedestal,\r\nhaving an object-glass about 19 inches focal length, and 1-5/8 inch\r\ndiameter, with magnifying powers for distant objects of 13 and 20\r\ntimes. When this instrument is directed to a miniature portrait,\r\n3-1/2 inches in length, placed in a good light, at the distance of\r\nabout 8 or 10 feet, it appears as large as an oil-painting four or\r\nfive feet long, and represents the individual as large as life. The\r\nfeatures of the face appear to stand out in bold relief: and perhaps\r\nthere is no representation of the human figure that more resembles\r\nthe living prototype, than in this exhibition, provided the miniature\r\nis finely executed. In this case the tube requires to be pulled out\r\nfour or five inches from the point of distinct vision for distant\r\nobjects, and consequently the magnifying power is proportionally\r\nincreased. Another class of objects to which such a telescope may be\r\napplied is _Perspective prints_, either of public buildings, streets\r\nor landscapes. When viewed in this way they present a panoramic\r\nappearance, and seem nearly as natural as life--just in the same manner\r\nas they appear in the Optical Diagonal Machine, or when reflected in\r\na large concave mirror--with this advantage, that, while in these\r\ninstruments the left hand side of the print appears where the right\r\nshould be,--the objects seen through the telescope appear exactly in\r\ntheir natural position. In this case, however, the telescope should\r\nhave a small magnifying power, not exceeding 5 or 6 times, so as to\r\ntake in the whole of the landscape. If an astronomical eye-piece be\r\nused, the print will require to be inverted.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of objects which may be viewed with this instrument, are\r\ntrees, flowers, and other objects in gardens immediately adjacent to\r\nthe apartment in which we make our observations. In this way we may\r\nobtain a distinct view of a variety of rural objects, which we cannot\r\neasily approach, such as the buds and blossoms on the tops of trees,\r\nand the insects with which they may be infested. There are certain\r\nobjects on which the telescope may be made to produce a powerful\r\nmicroscopical effect, such as the more delicate and beautiful kinds\r\nof flowers, the leaves of trees, and similar objects. In viewing\r\nsuch objects, the telescope may be brought within little more than\r\ndouble the focal distance of the object-glass from the objects to be\r\nviewed, and then the magnifying power is very considerably increased.\r\nA nosegay composed of a variety of delicate flowers, and even a\r\nsingle flower, such as the sea-pink, makes a splendid appearance in\r\nthis way. A peacock’s feather, or even the fibres on a common quill,\r\nappear very beautiful, when placed in a proper light. The leaves of\r\ntrees, particularly the leaf of the plane-tree, when placed against a\r\nwindow-pane, so that the light may shine through them--appear, in all\r\ntheir internal ramifications, more distinct, beautiful and interesting,\r\nthan when viewed in any other way; and in such views a large portion\r\nof the object is at once exhibited to the eye. In this case, the\r\neye-piece of such a telescope as that alluded to requires to be drawn\r\nout 12 or 14 inches beyond the point of distinct vision for objects\r\nat a distance--and the distance between these near objects and the\r\nobject-end of the telescope, is only about 3-1/2 feet.\r\n\r\nA telescope having a diagonal eye-piece presents a very pleasant view\r\nof near objects in this manner. With an instrument of this kind, I have\r\nfrequently viewed the larger kind of small objects alluded to above,\r\nsuch as the leaves of shrubs and trees, flowers consisting of a variety\r\nof parts, the fibres of a peacock’s feather and similar objects. In\r\nthis case the object-glass of the instrument, which is 10-1/2 inches\r\nfocal length, was brought within 22 inches of the object, and the eye\r\nlooked down upon it, in the same manner, as when we view objects in\r\na compound microscope. A common pocket achromatic telescope may be\r\nused for the purposes now stated, provided the tube in the eye-piece\r\ncontaining the two lenses next the object, be taken out, in which case\r\nthe two glasses next the eye form an astronomical eye-piece, and the\r\ntubes may be drawn out 5 or 6 inches beyond the focal point for distant\r\nobjects, and will produce distinct vision for objects not farther\r\ndistant than about 20 or 24 inches. But, in this case, the objects to\r\nbe viewed must be inverted, in order that they may be seen in their\r\nnatural positions when viewed through the instrument. Telescopes of\r\na large size and high magnifying powers may likewise be used with\r\nadvantage for viewing very near objects in gardens adjacent to the room\r\nin which the instruments are placed, provided the sliding-tube next the\r\neye has a range of two or three inches beyond the point of vision for\r\ndistant objects. In this case, a magnifying power of 100 times on a\r\n3-1/2 or a 5 feet achromatic produces a very pleasant effect. In making\r\nthe observations to which I have now alluded, it is requisite in order\r\nto distinct vision, and to obtain a pleasing view of the objects, that\r\nthe instrument should be placed on a pedestal, and capable of a motion\r\nin every direction. The adjustment for distinct vision may be made\r\neither by the sliding-tube, or by removing the telescope nearer to or\r\nfarther from the object.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFLECTIONS ON LIGHT AND VISION--AND ON THE NATURE AND UTILITY OF\r\nTELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nLight is one of the most wonderful and beneficial, and at the same time\r\none of the most mysterious agents in the material creation. Though the\r\nsun from which it flows to this part of our system is nearly a hundred\r\nmillions of miles from our globe, yet we perceive it as evidently, and\r\nfeel its influence as powerfully, as if it emanated from no higher a\r\nregion than the clouds. It supplies life and comfort to our physical\r\nsystem, and without its influence and operations on the various objects\r\naround us, we could scarcely subsist and participate of enjoyment for a\r\nsingle hour. It is diffused around us on every hand from its fountain\r\nthe sun; and even the stars, though at a distance hundreds of thousands\r\nof times greater than that of the solar orb, transmit to our distant\r\nregion a portion of this element. It gives beauty and fertility to the\r\nearth, it supports the vegetable and animal tribes, and is connected\r\nwith the various motions which are going forward throughout the\r\nsystem of the universe. It unfolds to us the whole scenery of external\r\nnature--the lofty mountains and the expansive plains, the majestic\r\nrivers and the mighty ocean; the trees, the flowers, the crystal\r\nstreams, and the vast canopy of the sky adorned with ten thousands of\r\nshining orbs. In short there is scarcely an object within the range of\r\nour contemplation, but what is exhibited to our understanding through\r\nthe medium of light, or at least bears a certain relation to this\r\nenlivening and universal agent. When we consider the extreme minuteness\r\nof the rays of light, their inconceivable velocity, the invariable laws\r\nby which they act upon all bodies, the multifarious phenomena produced\r\nby their inflections, refractions and reflections, while their original\r\nproperties remain the same; the endless variety of colours they\r\nproduce on every part of our terrestrial creation, and the facility\r\nwith which millions of rays pass through the smallest apertures, and\r\npervade substances of great density, while every ray passes forward in\r\nthe crowd without disturbing another, and produces its own specific\r\nimpression--we cannot but regard this element as the most wonderful,\r\nastonishing and delightful part of the material creation. When we\r\nconsider the admirable beauties and the exquisite pleasures of which\r\nlight is the essential source, and how much its nature is still\r\ninvolved in mystery, notwithstanding the profound investigations of\r\nmodern philosophers, we may well exclaim with the Poet:--\r\n\r\n    “How then shall I attempt to sing of HIM\r\n    Who, light himself, in uncreated light\r\n    Invested deep, dwells awfully retired\r\n    From mortal eye or angel’s purer ken;\r\n    Whose single smile has, from the first of time,\r\n    Filled, overflowing, all yon lamps of heaven,\r\n    That beam for ever through the boundless sky.”--THOMSON.\r\n\r\nThe eye is the instrument by which we perceive the beautiful and\r\nmultifarious effects of this universal agent. Its delicate and\r\ncomplicated structure, its diversified muscles, its coats and\r\nmembranes, its different humours possessed of different refractive\r\npowers, and the various contrivances for performing and regulating\r\nits external and internal motions, so as to accomplish the ends\r\nintended--clearly demonstrate this organ to be a master-piece of\r\nDivine mechanism--the workmanship of Him whose intelligence surpasses\r\nconception, and whose Wisdom is unsearchable. ‘Our sight (says Addison)\r\nis the most perfect and delightful of all our senses. It fills the\r\nmind with the largest variety of ideas, converses with its objects at\r\nthe greatest distance, and continues the longest in action, without\r\nbeing tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments. The sense of\r\nfeeling can indeed give us a notion of extension, shape, and all other\r\nideas that enter the eye, except colours; but at the same time it is\r\nvery much strained, and confined in its operation to the number, bulk\r\nand distance of its particular objects. Our sight seems designed to\r\nsupply all these defects, and may be considered as a more delicate and\r\ndiffusive kind of touch that spreads itself over an infinite multitude\r\nof bodies, comprehends the largest figures, and brings into our reach\r\nsome of the more remote parts of the universe.’\r\n\r\nCould we suppose an order of beings endued with every human faculty but\r\nthat of sight, it would appear incredible to such beings--accustomed\r\nonly to the slow information of touch--that by the addition of an\r\norgan consisting of a ball and socket, of an inch diameter, they might\r\nbe enabled, in an instant of time, without changing their place, to\r\nperceive the disposition of a whole army, the order of a battle, the\r\nfigure of a magnificent palace, or all the variety of a landscape. If\r\na man were by feeling to find out the figure of the Peak of Teneriffe,\r\nor even of St. Peter’s church at Rome, it would be the work of a\r\nlifetime. It would appear still more incredible to such beings as we\r\nhave supposed, if they were informed of the discoveries which may\r\nbe made by this little organ in things far beyond the reach of any\r\nother sense--that, by means of it we can find our way in the pathless\r\nocean--that we can traverse the globe of the earth, determine its\r\nfigure and dimensions, and delineate every region of it--yea, that we\r\ncan measure the planetary orbs, and make discoveries in the sphere of\r\nthe fixed stars. And, if they were farther informed that, by means of\r\nthis same organ, we can perceive the tempers and dispositions, the\r\npassions and affections of our fellow-creatures, even when they want\r\nmost to conceal them--that when the tongue is taught most artfully to\r\nlie and dissemble, the hypocrisy should appear in the countenance to a\r\ndiscerning eye--and that by this organ we can often perceive what is\r\nstraight and what is crooked in the mind as well as in the body--would\r\nit not appear still more astonishing to beings such as we have now\r\nsupposed?[33]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these wonderful properties of the organ of vision, the\r\neye, when unassisted by art, is comparatively limited in the range\r\nof its powers. It cannot ascertain the existence of certain objects\r\nat the distance of three or four miles, nor perceive what is going\r\nforward in nature or art beyond such a limit. By its natural powers\r\nwe perceive the moon to be a globe about half a degree in diameter,\r\nand diversified with two or three dusky spots, and that the sun is\r\na luminous body of apparently the same size--that the planets are\r\nluminous points, and that about a thousand stars exist in the visible\r\ncanopy of the sky. But the ten thousandth part of those luminaries,\r\nwhich are within the reach of human vision, can never be seen by the\r\nunassisted eye. Here the TELESCOPE interposes, and adds a new\r\npower to the organ of vision, by which it is enabled to extend its\r\nviews to regions of space immeasurably distant, and to objects, the\r\nnumber and magnitude of which could never otherwise have been surmised\r\nby the human imagination. By its aid we obtain a sensible demonstration\r\nthat space is boundless--that the universe is replenished with\r\ninnumerable suns and worlds--that the remotest regions of immensity,\r\nimmeasurably beyond the limits of unassisted vision, display the\r\nenergies of Creating Power, and that the Empire of the Creator extends\r\nfar beyond what eye hath seen or the human imagination can conceive.\r\n\r\nThe telescope is an instrument of a much more wonderful nature than\r\nwhat most people are apt to imagine. However popular such instruments\r\nnow are, and however common a circumstance it is to contemplate objects\r\nat a great distance which the naked eye cannot discern, yet, prior\r\nto their invention and improvement, it would have appeared a thing\r\nmost mysterious, if not impossible, that objects at the distance of\r\nten miles could be made to appear as if within a few yards of us, and\r\nthat some of the heavenly bodies could be seen as distinctly as if we\r\nhad been transported by some superior power, hundreds of millions of\r\nmiles beyond the bounds of our terrestrial habitation. Who could ever\r\nhave imagined--reasoning _a priori_--that the refraction of light in\r\nglass--the same power by which a straight rod appears crooked in water,\r\nby which vision is variously distorted, and by which we are liable to\r\ninnumerable deceptions--that that same power, or law of nature, by the\r\noperation of which the objects in a landscape appear distorted when\r\nseen through certain panes of glass in our windows, that that power\r\nshould ever be so modified and directed as to extend the boundaries\r\nof vision, and enable us clearly to distinguish scenes and objects at\r\na distance a thousand times beyond the natural limits of our visual\r\norgans? Yet such are the discoveries which science has achieved,\r\nsuch the powers it has brought to light, that by glasses ground into\r\ndifferent forms, and properly adapted to each other, we are enabled as\r\nit were to contract the boundaries of space, to penetrate into the most\r\ndistant regions, and to bring within the reach of our knowledge the\r\nmost sublime objects in the universe.\r\n\r\nWhen Pliny declared in reference to Hipparchus, the ancient astronomer,\r\n‘_Ausus rem Deo improbam annumerare posteris stellas_,’--that ‘he dared\r\nto enumerate the stars for posterity, an undertaking forbidden by God,’\r\nwhat would that natural historian have said, had it been foretold that\r\nin less than 1600 years afterwards, a man would arise who should enable\r\nposterity to perceive, and to enumerate ten times more new stars than\r\nHipparchus ever beheld--who should point out higher mountains on the\r\nmoon than on the earth, who should discover dark spots, as large as our\r\nglobe, in the sun, the fountain of light--who should descry four moons\r\nrevolving in different periods of time around the planet Jupiter, and\r\ncould show to surrounding senators the varying phases of Venus? and\r\nthat another would soon after arise who should point out a double ring\r\nof six hundred thousand miles in circumference, revolving around the\r\nplanet Saturn, and ten hundreds of thousands of stars which neither\r\nHipparchus nor any of the ancient astronomers could ever descry? Yet\r\nthese are only a small portion of the discoveries made by Galileo\r\nand Herschel, by means of the telescope. Had any one prophetically\r\ninformed Archimedes, the celebrated geometrician of Syracuse, that\r\nvision would, in after ages, be thus wonderfully assisted by art--and\r\nfurther, that one manner of improving vision would be to place a dark\r\n_opake_ body directly between the object and the eye--and that another\r\nmethod would be, not to look at the object, but to keep the eye quite\r\nin a different, and even in an _opposite_ direction, or to stand with\r\nthe back directly opposed to it, and to behold all the parts of it,\r\ninvisible to the naked eye, most distinctly in this way--he would,\r\ndoubtless have considered the prophet as an enthusiastic fool or a\r\nraving madman. Yet these things have been realized in modern times in\r\nthe fullest extent. In the Gregorian reflecting telescope an opake\r\nbody, namely the small speculum near the end of the tube, interposes\r\n_directly_ between the eye and the object. In the Newtonian Reflector,\r\nand in the diagonal eye-pieces formerly described, the eye is directed\r\nin a line at right angles to the object, or a deviation of 90 degrees\r\nfrom the direct line of vision. In Herschel’s’ large telescopes, and in\r\nthe _Aerial Reflector_ formerly described (in pp. 311-325) the back is\r\nturned to the object, and the eye in an opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances should teach us humility and a becoming diffidence\r\nin our own powers; and they should admonish us not to be too dogmatical\r\nor peremptory in affirming what is possible or impossible in regard\r\neither to nature or art, or to the operations of the Divine Being.\r\nArt has accomplished, in modern times, achievements, in regard to\r\nlocomotion, marine and aërial navigation, the improvement of vision,\r\nthe separation and combinations of invisible gases, and numerous\r\nother objects, of which the men of former ages could not have formed\r\nthe least conception. And even yet, we can set no boundaries to the\r\nfuture discoveries of science and the improvements of art; but have\r\nevery reason to indulge the hope that, in the ages to come, scenes of\r\nDivine mechanism in the system of nature will be unfolded, and the\r\neffects of chemical and mechanical powers displayed, of which the human\r\nmind, in its present state of progress, cannot form the most imperfect\r\nidea. Such circumstances likewise should teach us not to reject any\r\nintimations which have been made to us in relation to the character,\r\nattributes, and dispensations of the Divine Being, and the moral\r\nrevelations of his will given in the Sacred Records, because we are\r\nunable to comprehend every truth and to remove every difficulty, which\r\nrelates to the moral government of the Great Ruler of the universe.\r\nFor, if we meet with many circumstances in secular science, and even in\r\nthe common operations of nature, which are difficult to comprehend--if\r\neven the construction of such telescopes as we now use, would have\r\nappeared an incomprehensible mystery to ancient philosophers--we must\r\nexpect to find difficulties almost insurmountable to such limited\r\nminds as ours, in the eternal plans and moral arrangements of the\r\n“King Immortal and Invisible,” as delineated only in their outlines,\r\nin the Sacred Oracles--particularly those which relate to the origin\r\nof physical and moral evil, the ultimate destiny of man, and the\r\ninvisible realities of a future world.\r\n\r\nThe UTILITY of the telescope may be considered in relation to\r\nthe following circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it may be considered as an instrument or machine\r\nwhich virtually transports us to the distant regions of space. When\r\nwe look at the moon through a telescope which magnifies 200 times,\r\nand survey its extensive plains, its lofty peaks, its circular ranges\r\nof mountains, throwing their deep shadows over the vales, its deep\r\nand rugged caverns, and all the other varieties which appear on the\r\nLunar surface, we behold such objects in the same manner as if we were\r\nstanding at a point 238,800 miles from the earth in the direction of\r\nthe moon, or only twelve hundred miles from that orb, reckoning its\r\ndistance to be 240,000 miles. When we view the planet Saturn with a\r\nsimilar instrument, and obtain a view of its belts, and satellites, and\r\nits magnificent rings, we are transported, as it were, through regions\r\nof space, to a point in the heavens more than _nine hundred millions\r\nof miles_ from the surface of our globe, and contemplate those august\r\nobjects, as if we were placed within five millions of miles of the\r\nsurface of that planet.[34] Although a supernatural power, sufficient\r\nto carry us in such a celestial journey, a thousand miles every day,\r\nwere exerted--it would require more than two thousand four hundred and\r\nsixty years, before we could arrive at such a distant position; yet\r\nthe telescope, in a few moments, transports our visual powers to that\r\nfar distant point of space. When we view, with such an instrument, the\r\nminute and very distant clusters of stars in the Milky Way, we are\r\ncarried in effect through the regions of space to the distance of _five\r\nhundred thousand millions of miles_ from the earth; for we behold those\r\nluminaries through the telescope nearly as if they were actually viewed\r\nfrom such a distant point in the spaces of the firmament. These stars\r\ncannot be conceived as less than _a hundred billions_ of miles from\r\nour globe, and the instrument we have supposed brings them within the\r\ntwo hundredth part of this distance. Suppose we were carried forward\r\nby a rapid motion towards this point, at the rate of a thousand miles\r\n_every hour_, it would require more than _fifty-seven thousand years_,\r\nbefore we could reach that very distant station in space to which the\r\ntelescope, _in effect_, transports us. So that this instrument is far\r\nmore efficient in opening to our view the scenes of the universe than\r\nif we were invested with powers of locomotion to carry us through the\r\nregions of space, with the rapidity of a cannon ball at its utmost\r\nvelocity; and all the while we may sit at ease in our terrestrial\r\napartments.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the telescope has been _the means of enlarging\r\nour views of the sublime scenes of creation_, more than any other\r\ninstrument which art has contrived. Before the invention of this\r\ninstrument the universe was generally conceived as circumscribed within\r\nvery narrow limits. The earth was considered as among the largest\r\nbodies in creation; the planets were viewed as bodies of a far less\r\nsize than what they are now found to be; no bodies similar to our moon\r\nwere suspected as revolving around any of them; and the stars were\r\nsupposed to be little more than a number of brilliant lamps hung up\r\nto emit a few glimmering rays, and to adorn the canopy of our earthly\r\nhabitation. Such a wonderful phenomenon as the Ring of Saturn was\r\nnever once suspected, and the sun was considered as only a large ball\r\nof fire. It was suspected, indeed, that the moon was diversified with\r\nmountains and vales, and that it might possibly be a habitable world;\r\nbut nothing certainly could be determined on this point, on account of\r\nthe limited nature of unassisted vision. But the telescope has been\r\nthe means of expanding our views of the august scenes of creation to\r\nan almost unlimited extent. It has withdrawn the veil which formerly\r\ninterposed to intercept our view of the distant glories of the sky.\r\nIt has brought to light five new planetary bodies, unknown to former\r\nastronomers, one of which is more than eighty times larger than the\r\nearth--and seventeen _secondary_ planets which revolve around the\r\nprimary. It has expanded the dimensions of the solar system to double\r\nthe extent which was formerly supposed. It has enabled us to descry\r\nhundreds of comets which would otherwise have escaped our unassisted\r\nvision, and to determine some of their trajectories and periods of\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nIt has explored the profundities of the Milky Way, and enabled us to\r\nperceive hundreds of thousands of those splendid orbs, where scarcely\r\none is visible to the naked eye. It has laid open to our view thousands\r\nof _Nebulæ_, of various descriptions, dispersed through different\r\nregions of the firmament--many of them containing thousands of separate\r\nstars. It has directed our investigations to thousands of double,\r\ntreble and multiple stars--suns revolving around suns, and systems\r\naround systems, and has enabled us to determine some of the periods of\r\ntheir revolutions. It has demonstrated the immense distances of the\r\nstarry orbs from our globe, and their consequent magnitudes; since\r\nit shows us that, having brought them nearer to our view by several\r\nhundreds or thousands of times, they still appear only as so many\r\nshining _points_. It has enabled us to perceive that mighty changes are\r\ngoing forward throughout the regions of immensity--new stars appearing,\r\nand others removed from our view, and motions of incomprehensible\r\nvelocity carrying forward those magnificent orbs through the spaces of\r\nthe firmament. In short, it has opened a vista to regions of space so\r\nimmeasurably distant, that a cannon ball impelled with its greatest\r\nvelocity, would not reach tracts of creation so remote in two thousand\r\nmillions of years, and even light itself, the swiftest body in nature,\r\nwould require more than a thousand years before it could traverse this\r\nmighty interval. It has thus laid a foundation for our acquiring an\r\napproximate idea of the infinity of space, and for obtaining a glimpse\r\nof the far distant scenes of creation, and the immense extent of the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nAgain, the telescope, in consequence of the discoveries it has enabled\r\nus to make, has tended _to amplify our conceptions of the attributes\r\nand the Empire of the Deity_. The amplitude of our conceptions of\r\nthe Divine Being bears a certain proportion to the expansion of our\r\nviews in regard to his works of creation, and the operations he is\r\nincessantly carrying forward throughout the universe. If our views of\r\nthe works of God, and of the manifestations he has given of himself to\r\nhis intelligent creatures, be circumscribed to a narrow sphere, as to\r\na parish, a province, a kingdom, or a single world, our conceptions of\r\nthat Great Being, will be proportionably limited. For it is chiefly\r\nfrom the manifestation of God in the material creation that our\r\nideas of his Power, his Wisdom, and his other natural attributes,\r\nare derived. But in proportion to the ample range of prospect we\r\nare enabled to take of the operations of the Most High, will be\r\nour conceptions of his character, attributes, and agency. Now, the\r\ntelescope--more than any other invention of man--has tended to open to\r\nour view the most magnificent and extensive prospects of the works of\r\nGod. It has led us to ascertain that, within the limits of the solar\r\nsystem, there are bodies which, taken together, comprise a mass of\r\nmatter nearly two thousand five hundred times greater than that of the\r\nearth--that these bodies are all constituted and arranged in such a\r\nmanner as to fit them for being habitable worlds--and that the sun, the\r\ncentre of this system, is five hundred times larger than the whole.\r\nBut, far beyond the limits of this system, it has presented to our view\r\na universe beyond the grasp of finite intelligences, and to which human\r\nimagination can assign no boundaries. It has enabled us to descry suns\r\nclustering behind suns, rising to view in boundless perspective, in\r\nproportion to the extent of its magnifying and illuminating powers--the\r\nnumbers of which are to be estimated, not merely by thousands, and\r\ntens of thousands, and hundreds of thousands, but by scores of\r\n_millions_--leaving us no room to doubt that hundreds of millions more,\r\nbeyond the utmost limits of human vision, even when assisted by art,\r\nlie hid from mortal view’s in the unexplored and unexplorable regions\r\nof immensity.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we are presented with a scene which gives us a display\r\nof _Omnipotent Power_ which no other objects can unfold, and which,\r\nwithout the aid of the telescope, we should never have beheld--a\r\nscene which expands our conceptions of the Divine Being, to an extent\r\nwhich the men of former generations could never have anticipated--a\r\nscene which enables us to form an approximate idea of Him who is the\r\n“King Eternal, Immortal, and Invisible,” who “created all worlds, and\r\nfor whose pleasure they are, and were created.” Here we behold the\r\noperations of a Being whose power is illimitable and uncontrollable,\r\nand which far transcends the comprehension of the highest created\r\nintelligences--a power, displayed not only in the vast extension of\r\nmaterial existence, and the countless number of mighty globes which\r\nthe universe contains--but in the astonishingly _rapid motions_ with\r\nwhich myriads of them are carried along through the immeasurable spaces\r\nof creation,--some of those magnificent orbs moving with a velocity\r\nof one hundred and seventy thousand miles an hour. Here, likewise, we\r\nhave a display of the infinite _Wisdom_ and Intelligence of the Divine\r\nMind, in the harmony and order with which all the mighty movements of\r\nthe universe are conducted--in proportionating the magnitudes, motions\r\nand distances of the planetary worlds--in the nice adjustment of the\r\nprojectile velocity to the attractive power--in the constant proportion\r\nbetween the times of the periodical revolution of the planets and\r\nthe cubes of their mean distances--in the _distances_ of the several\r\nplanets from the central body of the system, compared with their\r\nrespective _densities_--and in the constancy and regularity of their\r\nmotions, and the exactness with which they accomplish their destined\r\nrounds--all which circumstances evidently show that He who contrived\r\nthe universe is “the only Wise God,” who is “wonderful in counsel\r\nand excellent in working.” Here, in fine, is a display of _boundless\r\nbenevolence_. For we cannot suppose, for a moment, that so many myriads\r\nof magnificent globes, fitted to be the centres of a countless number\r\nof mighty worlds, should be nothing else than barren wastes, without\r\nthe least relation to intelligent existence. And if they are peopled\r\nwith intellectual beings of various orders--how vast must be their\r\nnumbers, and how overflowing that Divine Beneficence which has provided\r\nfor them all, every thing requisite to their existence and happiness!\r\n\r\nIn these discoveries of the telescope, we obtain a glimpse of the\r\ngrandeur and the unlimited extent of God’s universal empire. To this\r\nempire no boundaries can be perceived. The larger, and the more\r\npowerful our telescopes are, the further are we enabled to penetrate\r\ninto those distant and unknown regions; and however far we penetrate\r\ninto the abyss of space, new objects of wonder and magnificence still\r\ncontinue rising to our view--affording the strongest presumption,\r\nthat were we to penetrate ten thousand times farther into those\r\nremote spaces of immensity, new suns, and systems, and worlds would\r\nbe disclosed to our view. Over all this vast assemblage of material\r\nexistence, and over all the sensitive and intellectual beings it\r\ncontains, God eternally and unchangably presides; and the minutest\r\nmovements, either of the physical or the intelligent system, throughout\r\nevery department of those vast dominions, are at every moment “naked\r\nand open” to his Omniscient eye. What _boundless Intelligence_ is\r\nimplied in the _Superintendence_ and _arrangement_ of the affairs of\r\nsuch an unlimited empire! and what a lofty and expansive idea does it\r\nconvey of Him who sits on the throne of Universal Nature, and whose\r\ngreatness is unsearchable! But without the aids of the telescopic tube,\r\nwe could not have formed such ample conceptions of the greatness,\r\neither of the Eternal Creator himself, or of the universe which he hath\r\nbrought into existence.\r\n\r\nBesides the above, the following uses of the telescope, in relation to\r\nscience and common life, may be shortly noticed:--\r\n\r\nIn the business of astronomy, scarcely any thing can be done with\r\naccuracy without the assistance of the telescope. 1. It enables the\r\nastronomer to determine with precision _the transits of the planets\r\nand stars_, across the meridian; and on the accuracy with which\r\nthese transits are obtained, a variety of important conclusions and\r\ncalculations depend. The computation of astronomical and nautical\r\ntables for aiding the navigator in his voyages round the globe, and\r\nfacilitating his calculations of latitude and longitude, is derived\r\nfrom observations made by the telescope, without the use of which\r\ninstrument, they cannot be made with precision. 2. The _apparent\r\ndiameters of the planets_ can only be measured by means of this\r\ninstrument, furnished with a micrometer. By the naked eye no accurate\r\nmeasurements of the diameters of these bodies can be taken; and\r\nwithout knowing their apparent diameters, in minutes or seconds, their\r\nreal bulk cannot be determined, even although their exact distances\r\nbe known. The differences, too, between their polar and equatorial\r\ndiameters cannot be ascertained without observations made by powerful\r\ntelescopes. For example, the equatorial diameter of Jupiter is found\r\nto be in proportion to the polar as 14 to 13, that is, the equatorial\r\nis more than 6000 miles longer than the polar diameter, which could\r\nnever have been determined by observations made by the naked eye.\r\n3. The _parallaxes_ of the heavenly bodies can only be accurately\r\nascertained by the telescope; and it is only from the knowledge of\r\ntheir parallaxes, that their distances from the earth or from the\r\nsun can be determined. In the case of the fixed stars, nothing of\r\nthe nature of a parallax could ever be expected to be found without\r\nthe aid of a telescope. It was by searching for the parallax of a\r\ncertain fixed star, that the important fact of the _Aberration of\r\nlight_ was discovered. The observations, for this purpose, were made\r\nby means of a telescope 24 feet long, fixed in a certain position. 4.\r\nThe motions and revolutionary periods of _Sidereal systems_, can only\r\nbe determined by observations made by telescopes of great magnifying\r\nand illuminating powers. Without a telescope the small stars which\r\naccompany double or treble stars cannot be perceived, and much less\r\ntheir motions or variation of their relative positions. Before the\r\ninvention of the telescope such phenomena--now deemed so wonderful\r\nand interesting--could never have been surmised. 5. The accurate\r\ndetermination of the longitude of places on the earth’s surface is\r\nascertained by the telescope, by observing with this instrument the\r\nimmersions and emersions of the satellites of Jupiter. From such\r\nobservations, with the aid of a chronometer, and having the time at any\r\nknown place, the situation of any unknown place is easily determined.\r\nBut the eclipses of Jupiter’s moons can be perceived only by telescopic\r\ninstruments of considerable power. 6. By means of a telescope, with\r\ncross hairs in the focus of the eye-glass, and attached to a Quadrant,\r\nthe altitude of the sun or of a star, particularly the pole-star, may\r\nbe most accurately taken; and, from such observations, the _latitude_\r\nof the place may be readily and accurately deduced.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the _Surveying of land_, the telescope is particularly\r\nuseful; and for this purpose it is mounted on a stand with a horizontal\r\nand vertical motion, pointing out by divisions the degrees and minutes\r\nof inclination of the instrument. For the more accurate reading\r\nof these divisions, the two limbs are furnished with a Nonius, or\r\n_Vernier’s scale_. The object here is to take the angular distances\r\nbetween distant objects on a plane truly horizontal; or else the\r\nangular elevation or depression of objects above or below the plane\r\nof the horizon. In order to obtain either of those kinds of angles to\r\na requisite degree of exactness, it is necessary that the surveyor\r\nshould have as clear and distinct a view as possible of the objects,\r\nor station-staves, which he fixes up for his purpose, that he may\r\nwith the greater certainty determine the point of the object which\r\nexactly corresponds with the line he is taking. Now, as such objects\r\nare generally at too great a distance for the surveyor to be able\r\nto distinguish with the naked eye, he takes the assistance of the\r\ntelescope, by which he obtains, 1. A distinct view of the object to\r\nwhich his attention is directed, and 2. he is enabled to determine the\r\nprecise point of the object aimed at, by means of the cross hairs in\r\nthe focus of the eye-glass. A telescope mounted for this purpose is\r\ncalled a _Theodolite_, which is derived from two Greek words θεομαι _to\r\nsee_, and οδος, _the way_ or _distance_.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the telescope is an instrument of special\r\nimportance, in the conducting of _Telegraphs_, and in the conveyance\r\nof _signals_ of all descriptions. Without its assistance telegraphic\r\ndispatches could not be conveyed with accuracy to any considerable\r\ndistance, nor in quadruple the time in which they are now communicated,\r\nand the different stations would need to be exceedingly numerous. But\r\nby the assistance of the telescope information may be communicated, by\r\na series of telegraphs, with great rapidity. Twenty-seven telegraphs\r\nconvey information from Paris to Calais--a distance of 160 miles--in 3\r\nminutes; twenty-two from Paris to Lisle in 2 minutes; forty-six from\r\nStrasburg to Paris in 4-1/2 minutes; and eighty from Paris to Brest\r\nin 10 minutes. In many other cases which occur both on land and on\r\nsea, the telescope is essentially requisite for descrying signals.\r\nThe _Bell-Rock Light House_, for example, is situated 12 miles from\r\nArbroath, and from every other portion of land, so that the naked eye\r\ncould not discern any signal which the keepers of that light could have\r\nit in their power to make; but by means of a large telescope in the\r\nstation-house in Arbroath, the hoisting of a ball every morning at 9\r\nA.M.--which indicates that ‘All is well’--may be distinctly\r\nrecognised.\r\n\r\nMany other uses of this instrument, in the ordinary transactions of\r\nlife, will readily occur to the reader; and therefore I shall only\r\nmention the following purpose to which it may be applied, namely,--\r\n\r\n_To measure the distance of an object from one station._ This depends\r\nupon the increase of the focal distance of the telescope in the case\r\nof near objects. Look through a telescope at the object whose distance\r\nis required, and adjust the focus till it appear quite distinct;\r\nthen slide in the drawer, till the object begins to be obscure, and\r\nmark that place of the tube precisely. Next draw out the tube till\r\nthe object begins to be again obscured, and then make another mark\r\nas before. Then take the middle point between these two marks, and\r\nthat will be the point where the image of the object is formed most\r\ndistinctly; which is to be nicely measured from the object lens, and\r\ncompared with the solar focus of the lens or telescope, so as to\r\nascertain their difference. And the rule for finding the distance\r\nis,--‘As the difference between the focal distance of the object, and\r\nthe solar focal distance : Is to the solar focal distance :: So is the\r\nfocal distance of the object : To its true distance from the object\r\nlens.’ An example will render this matter more perspicuous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 84._]\r\n\r\nLet AB (fig. 84.) be the object lens, EY the eye-glass, FC the radius,\r\nor focus of the lens AB, and C_f_ the focal distance of the object OB,\r\nwhose distance is to be measured. Now suppose CF = 48 inches, or 4\r\nfeet, and that we find by the above method that C_f_ is 50 inches, then\r\nF_f_ is 2 inches; and the analogy is:--As F_f_ = 2, is to CF = 48, so\r\nis C_f_ = 50, to CQ = 1200 inches, or 100 feet. Again, suppose C_f_ =\r\n49 inches, then will F_f_ = 1 inch; and the proportion is, 1 : 48 :: 49\r\n: 2352 = QC, or 196 feet. A telescope of this focal length, however,\r\nwill measure only small distances. But, suppose AB a lens whose solar\r\nfocus is 12 feet, or 144 inches; and that we find, by the above method,\r\nthat C_f_, or the focal distance of the object, is 146 inches; then\r\nwill F_f_ be 2 inches, and the proportion will be, as 2 : 144 :: 146\r\n: 21024 inches, or 1752 feet = the distance QC. If with such a large\r\ntelescope, we view an object OB, and find F_f_ but 1/10th of an inch,\r\nthis will give the distance of the object as 17292 feet or nearly 3-1/3\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nSince the difference between the radius of the object lens and the\r\nfocal distance of the object is so considerable as 2 inches in a tube\r\nof 4 feet, and more than 12 inches in one of 12 feet, a method might\r\nbe contrived for determining the distance of near objects by the\r\nformer, and more distant objects by the latter, by inspection only.\r\nThis may be done by adjusting or drawing a spiral line round the drawer\r\nor tube, through the _two inch space_ in the small telescope, and by\r\ncalculation, graduate it for every 100 feet, and the intermediate\r\ninches, and then, at the same time we view an object, we may see its\r\ndistance on the tube. In making such experiments, a common object-glass\r\nof a long focal length, and a single eye-glass, are all that is\r\nrequisite; since the inverted appearance of the object can cause no\r\ngreat inconveniency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE METHOD OF GRINDING AND POLISHING OPTICAL LENSES AND SPECULA.\r\n\r\nI originally intended to enter into particular details on this subject,\r\nfor the purpose of gratifying those mechanics and others who wish\r\nto amuse themselves by constructing telescopes and other optical\r\ninstruments for their own use; but, having dwelt so long on the subject\r\nof telescopes, in the preceding pages, I am constrained to confine\r\nmyself to a very general sketch.\r\n\r\n1. _To grind and polish lenses for eye-glasses, microscopes, &c._\r\n\r\nFirst provide an upright spindle, at the bottom of which a pulley is\r\nfixed, which must be turned by a wheel by means of a cord and handle.\r\nAt the top of the spindle make a screw the same as a lathe-spindle, on\r\nwhich you may screw chocks of different sizes, to which the brass tool\r\nin which the lens is to be ground, may be fixed. Having fixed upon the\r\nbreadth and focal length of the lens, and whether it is to be a plano,\r\nor a double convex--take a piece of tin-plate or sheet copper, and,\r\nwith a pair of compasses, draw an arch upon its surface, near one of\r\nits extremities, with a radius equal to the focal distance of the lens,\r\nif intended to be double convex, or with half that distance, if it is\r\nto be plano-convex. Remove with a file that part of the copper which\r\nis without the circular arch, and then a _convex_ gage is formed. With\r\nthe same radius strike another arch, and having removed that part of\r\nthe copper which is _within_ it, a _concave_ gage will be obtained. The\r\nbrass tool, in which the glass is to be ground, is then to be fixed\r\nupon a turning-lathe, and turned into a portion of a concave sphere,\r\nso as to correspond to the convex gage. In order to obtain an accurate\r\nfigure to the concave tool, a convex tool of exactly the same radius\r\nis generally formed, and they are ground one upon another with flour\r\nemery; and when they exactly coincide, they are fit for use. The convex\r\ntool will serve for grinding _concave_ glasses of the same radius--and\r\nit should be occasionally ground in the concave tool to prevent it from\r\naltering its figure.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be attended to is, to prepare the piece of glass\r\nwhich is to be ground, by chipping it in a circular shape, by means\r\nof a large pair of scissors, and removing the roughness from its\r\nedges by a common grind-stone. The faces of the glass near the edges\r\nshould likewise be ground on the grind-stone, till they nearly fit\r\nthe concave gage, by which the labour of grinding in the tool will be\r\nconsiderably saved. The next thing required is to prepare the emery for\r\ngrinding, which is done in the following manner. Provide four or five\r\nclean earthen vessels; fill one of them with water, and put into it a\r\npound or half a pound of fine emery, and stir it about with a stick;\r\nafter which let it stand 3 or 4 seconds, and then pour it into another\r\nvessel, which may stand about 10 seconds; then pour it off again into\r\nthe several vessels till the water is quite clear; and by this means,\r\nemery of different degrees of fineness is obtained, which must be kept\r\nseparate from each other, and worked in their proper order, beginning\r\nat the first, and working off all the marks of the grind-stone; then\r\ntake of the second, next of the third, &c.,--holding the glass upon\r\nthe pan or tool with a light hand, when it comes to be nearly fit\r\nfor polishing. The glass in this operation should be cemented to a\r\nwooden handle, by means of pitch or other strong cement. After the\r\nfinest emery has been used, the roughness which remains may be taken\r\naway, and a slight polish given by grinding the glass with pounded\r\npumice-stone. Before proceeding to the polishing, the glass should be\r\nground as smooth as possible, and all the scratches erased, otherwise\r\nthe polishing will become a tedious process. The polishing is performed\r\nas follows: Tie a piece of linen rag or of fine cloth about the tool,\r\nand with fine putty, (calcined tin), or colcothar of vitriol (a very\r\nfine powder, sometimes called the red oxide of iron) moistened with\r\nwater, continue the grinding motion, and in a short time there will be\r\nan excellent polish.\r\n\r\nIn order to grind lenses very accurately for the finest optical\r\npurposes, particularly object-glasses for telescopes--the concave tool\r\nis firmly fixed to a table or bench, and the glass wrought upon it by\r\nthe hand with circular strokes so that its centre may never go beyond\r\nthe edges of the tool. For every 6 or 7 circular strokes, the glass\r\nshould receive 2 or 3 cross ones along the diameter of the tool, and in\r\ndifferent directions; and while the operation is going on, the convex\r\ntool should, at the end of five minutes, be wrought upon the concave\r\none for a few seconds, in order to preserve the same curvature to the\r\ntools and to the glass. The finest polish is generally given in the\r\nfollowing way. Cover the concave tool with a layer of pitch hardened\r\nby the addition of a little rosin, to the thickness of 1/15th of an\r\ninch. Then, having taken a piece of thin writing paper, press it upon\r\nthe surface of the pitch with the convex tool, and pull the paper\r\nquickly from the pitch before it has adhered to it; and if the surface\r\nof the pitch is marked every where with the lines of the paper, it\r\nwill be truly spherical. If any paper remains on the surface of the\r\npitch, it may be rubbed off by soap and water, and if the marks of\r\nthe paper should not appear on any part of it, the operation must be\r\nrepeated, till the polisher or bed of pitch is accurately spherical.\r\nThe glass is then to be wrought on the polisher by circular and cross\r\nstrokes with the putty or colcothar, till it has received a complete\r\npolish. When one side is finished, the glass must be separated from its\r\nhandle, by inserting the point of a knife between it and the pitch,\r\nand giving it a gentle stroke. The pitch which remains upon the glass\r\nmay be removed by rubbing it with a little oil or spirits of wine. The\r\noperation of polishing on cloth is slower, and the polish less perfect\r\nthan on pitch; but it is a mode best fitted for those who have little\r\nexperience, and who would be apt, in the first instance, to injure the\r\nfigure of the lens by polishing it on a bed of pitch.\r\n\r\n2. _On the method of casting and grinding the Specula of Reflecting\r\nTelescopes._\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be considered in the formation of reflecting\r\ntelescopes, is the _composition_ of the metal of which the specula\r\nare made. The qualities required are--a sound uniform metal, free\r\nfrom all microscopic pores--not liable to tarnish by absorption of\r\nmoisture from the atmosphere--not so hard as to be incapable of taking\r\na good figure and polish--nor so soft as to be easily scratched, and\r\npossessing a high reflecting power. Various compositions have been\r\nused for this purpose, of which the following are specimens:--Take\r\ngood Swedish copper 32 ounces, and when melted, add 14-1/2 ounces of\r\ngrain tin to it; then, having taken off the scoria, cast it into an\r\ningot. This metal must be a second time melted to cast a speculum; but\r\nit will fuse in this compound state with a small heat, and therefore\r\nwill not calcine the tin to putty. It should be poured off as soon as\r\nit is melted, giving it no more heat than is absolutely necessary. The\r\nbest method for giving the melted metal a good surface is this: the\r\nmoment before it is poured off, throw into the crucible a spoonful of\r\ncharcoal-dust; immediately after which the metal must be stirred with\r\na wooden spatula and poured into the moulds.--The following is another\r\ncomposition somewhat similar. Take 2 parts copper as pure as it is\r\npossible to procure; this must be melted in a crucible by itself. Then\r\nput, in another crucible, 1 part of pure grain tin. When they are both\r\nmelted, mix and stir them with a wooden spatula, keeping a good flux\r\non the melted surface to prevent oxidation, and then pour the metal\r\nquickly into the moulds, which may be made of founder’s loam.\r\n\r\nThe composition suggested, more than half a century ago, by the Rev.\r\nMr. Edwards, has often been referred to with peculiar approbation. This\r\ngentleman took a great deal of pains to discover the best composition,\r\nand to give his metals a fine polish and the true parabolical figure.\r\nHis telescopes were tried by Dr. Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, who\r\nfound them greatly to excel in brightness, and to equal in other\r\nrespects those made by the best artists. They showed a white object\r\nperfectly white, and all objects of their proper colour. He found,\r\nafter trying various combinations, the following to be the best: namely\r\n32 ounces of copper, with 15 or 16 ounces of grain tin, (according to\r\nthe purity of the copper) with the addition of one ounce of brass,\r\none of silver, and one ounce of arsenic. This, he affirms, will form\r\na metal capable, when polished in a proper manner, of reflecting more\r\nlight than any other metal yet made public.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. J. Little, in his observations on this subject in the ‘Irish\r\nTransactions,’ proposes the following composition, which he found to\r\nanswer the purpose better than any he had tried, namely--32 parts\r\nof best bar copper, previously fluxed with the black flux, of two\r\nparts tartar and one of nitre, 4 parts brass, 16 parts tin, and 1-1/4\r\narsenic. If the metal be granulated, by pouring it, when first melted,\r\ninto water, and then fused a second time, it will be less porous than\r\nat first. In this process, the chief object is, to hit on the exact\r\npoint of the saturation of the copper, &c., by the tin. For, if the\r\nlatter be added in too great quantity, the metal will be dull coloured\r\nand soft; if too little, it will not attain the most perfect whiteness,\r\nand will certainly tarnish.[35]\r\n\r\nWhen the metal is cast, and prepared by the common grind-stone for\r\nreceiving its proper figure--the gages and grinding-tools are to be\r\nformed in the same manner as formerly described for lenses, with this\r\ndifference, that the radius of the gages must always be _double_\r\nthe focal length of the speculum, as the focus of parallel rays by\r\nreflection is at one half the radius of concavity. In addition to the\r\nconcave and convex tools--which should be only a little broader than\r\nthe metal itself--a convex elliptical tool of lead and tin should\r\nbe formed with the same radius, so that its transverse should be to\r\nits conjugate diameter as 10 to 9, the latter being exactly equal to\r\nthe diameter of the metal. The grinding of the speculum is then to\r\nbe commenced, on this tool, with coarse emery powder and water, when\r\nthe roughness is taken off, by moving the speculum across the tool,\r\nin different directions, walking round the post on which the tool\r\nis fixed, holding the speculum by the wooden handle to which it is\r\ncemented. It is then to be wrought with great care on the convex brass\r\ntool, with circular and cross strokes, and with emery of different\r\ndegrees--the concave tool being sometimes ground upon the convex one,\r\nto keep them all of the same radius, and when every scratch is removed\r\nfrom its surface, it will be fit for receiving the final polish.\r\n\r\nWhen the metal is ready for polishing, the elliptical tool is to\r\nbe covered with black pitch about 1/20th of an inch thick, and the\r\npolisher formed in the same way as in the case of lenses, either with\r\nthe concave brass tool or with the metal itself. The colcothar of\r\nvitriol should then be triturated between two surfaces of glass, and\r\na considerable quantity of it applied at first to the surface of the\r\npolisher. The speculum is then to be wrought, in the usual way, upon\r\nthe polishing tool, till it has received a brilliant lustre, taking\r\ncare to use no more of the colcothar, if it can be avoided, and only a\r\nsmall quantity of it, if it should be found necessary. When the metal\r\nmoves stiffly on the polisher, and the colcothar assumes a dark muddy\r\nhue, the polish advances with great rapidity. The tool will then grow\r\nwarm, and would probably stick to the speculum, if its motion were\r\ndiscontinued for a moment. At this stage of the process, therefore, we\r\nmust proceed with great caution, breathing continually on the polisher,\r\ntill the friction is so great, as to retard the motion of the speculum.\r\nWhen this happens, the metal is to be slipped off the tool at one side,\r\ncleaned with soft leather, and placed in a tube for the purpose of\r\ntrying its performance; and if the polishing has been conducted with\r\ncare, it will be found to have a true _parabolic_ figure.[36]\r\n\r\nIt was formerly the practice, before the speculum was brought to the\r\npolisher, to smooth it on a _bed of hones_, or a convex tool made of\r\nthe best blue stone, such as clockmakers use in polishing their work,\r\nwhich was made one fourth part larger than the metal which was to be\r\nground upon it, and turned as true as possible to a gage. But this tool\r\nis not generally considered as absolutely necessary, except when silver\r\nand brass enter into the composition of the metal, in order to remove\r\nthe roughness which remains after grinding with the emery.\r\n\r\n_To try the figure of the metal._--In order to this, the speculum must\r\nbe placed in the tube of the telescope for which it is intended; and,\r\nat about 20 or 30 yards distant, there should be put up a watch-paper,\r\nor similar object, on which there are some very fine strokes of an\r\nengraver. An annular kind of diagram should be made with card-paper,\r\nso as to cover a circular portion of the middle part of the speculum,\r\nbetween the hole and the circumference, equal in breadth to about\r\n1/8 of its diameter. This paper ring should be fixed in the mouth\r\nof the telescope, and remain so during the whole experiment. There\r\nmust likewise be two other circular pieces of card-paper cut out, of\r\nsuch sizes, that one may cover the centre of the metal, by completely\r\nfilling the hole in the annular piece now described: and the other such\r\na round piece as shall exactly fill the tube, and so broad as that\r\nthe inner edge just touches the outward circumference of the middle\r\nannular piece. All these pieces together will completely shut up the\r\nmouth of the telescope. Let the round piece which covers the centre of\r\nthe metal be removed, and adjust the instrument so that the image may\r\nbe as sharp and distinct as possible. Then replace the central piece,\r\nand remove the outside annular one, by which means the circumference\r\nonly of the speculum will be exposed; and the image now formed will be\r\nfrom the rays reflected from the exterior side of the metal. If the two\r\nimages formed by these two portions of the metal be perfectly sharp and\r\nequally distinct, the speculum is perfect and of the true parabolic\r\ncurve. If, on the contrary, the image from the outside of the metal\r\nshould not be distinct and that it should be necessary to bring the\r\nlittle speculum _nearer_ by the screw, the metal is not yet brought to\r\nthe parabolic figure; but if, in order to procure distinctness, we be\r\nobliged to move the small speculum farther off, then the figure of the\r\ngreat speculum has been carried beyond the parabolic, and has assumed\r\nthe hyperbolic form.\r\n\r\n_To adjust the eye-hole of Gregorian Reflectors._--If there is only\r\none eye-glass, then the distance of the small hole should be as nearly\r\nas possible equal to its focal length. But in the compound Huygenian\r\neye-piece, the distance of the eye-hole may be thus found:--Multiply\r\nthe difference between the focal distance of the glass next to the\r\nspeculum, and the distance of the two eye-glasses, by the focal\r\ndistance of the glass nearest the eye; divide the product by the sum\r\nof the focal distances of the two lenses, lessened by their distance,\r\nand the quotient will be the compound focal distance required. Thus,\r\nif the focal distance of the lens next the speculum be 3 inches, that\r\nof the lens next the eye 1 inch, and their distance 2 inches, then the\r\ncompound focal distance from the eye-glass will be (3 - 2 × 1)/(3 × 1\r\n- 2) = 1/2 inch.--The _diameter_ of the eye-hole is always equal to\r\nthe quotient obtained by dividing the diameter of the great speculum\r\nby the magnifying power of the telescope. It is generally from 1/25th\r\nto 1/50th of an inch in diameter. It is necessary, in many cases, to\r\nobtain, _from direct experiment_, an accurate determination of the\r\nplace and size of the eye-hole, as on this circumstance depends, in a\r\ncertain degree, the accurate performance of the instrument.\r\n\r\n_To center the two specula of Gregorian Reflectors._--Extend two fine\r\nthreads or wires across the aperture of the tube at right angles, so as\r\nto intersect each other, exactly in the axis of the telescope. Before\r\nthe arm is finally fastened to the slider, place it in the tube, and\r\nthrough the eye-piece (without glasses) the intersection of the cross\r\nwires must be seen exactly in the centre of the hole of the arm. When\r\nthis exactness is obtained, let the arm be firmly riveted and soldered\r\nto the slider.\r\n\r\n_To centre lenses._--The centering of lenses is of great importance,\r\nmore especially for the object-glasses of achromatic instruments. The\r\nfollowing is reckoned a good method:--Let the lens to be centered be\r\ncemented on a brass chuck, having the middle turned away so as not to\r\ntouch the lens, but near the edge, which will be hid when mounted. This\r\nrim is very accurately turned flat where it is to touch the glass. When\r\nthe chuck and cement is warm it is made to revolve rapidly: while in\r\nmotion a lighted candle is brought before it, and its reflected image\r\nattentively watched. If this image has any motion, the lens is not\r\nflat or central; a piece of soft wood must therefore be applied to it\r\nin the manner of a turning tool, till such time as the light becomes\r\nstationary. When the whole has cooled, the edges of the lens must be\r\nturned by a diamond, or ground with emery.\r\n\r\nFor more particular details in reference to grinding and polishing\r\nspecula and lenses, the reader is referred to Smith’s ‘Complete system\r\nof Optics’--Imison’s ‘School of Arts’--_Huygenii Opera_--Brewster’s\r\nAppendix to ‘Ferguson’s Lectures’--‘Irish Transactions,’ vol.

XVI., Nos. 65, 66, for January and\r\nFebruary, 1807.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nON VARIOUS ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nON MICROMETERS.\r\n\r\nA micrometer is an instrument attached to a telescope, in order to\r\nmeasure small spaces in the heavens, such as the spaces between two\r\nstars, and the diameters of the sun, moon and planets--and by the\r\nhelp of which the _apparent magnitude_ of all objects viewed through\r\ntelescopes may be measured with great exactness.\r\n\r\nThere are various descriptions of these instruments, constructed with\r\ndifferent substances, and in various forms, of which the following\r\nconstitute the principal variety. The _Wire_ micrometer--the _Spider’s\r\nline_ micrometer--the Polymetric reticle--Divided _object glass_\r\nmicrometer--Divided _eye-glass_ micrometer--Ramsden’s _Catoptric_\r\nmicrometer--Rochon’s _crystal_ micrometer--Maskelyne’s _Prismatic_\r\nmicrometer--Brewster’s _micrometrical telescope_--Sir W. Herschel’s\r\n_Lamp_ micrometer--Cavallo’s _Mother of Pearl_ micrometer, and several\r\nothers. But, instead of attempting even a general description of\r\nthese instruments, I shall confine myself merely to a very brief\r\ndescription of _Cavallo’s Micrometer_, as its construction will be\r\neasily understood by the general reader, as it is one of the most\r\nsimple of these instruments, and is so cheap as to be procured for\r\na few shillings; while some of the instruments now mentioned are so\r\nexpensive, as to cost nearly as much as a tolerably good telescope.[37]\r\n\r\nThis micrometer consists of a thin and narrow slip of mother of pearl\r\nfinely divided, which is placed in the focus of the eye-glass of a\r\ntelescope, just where the image of the object is formed; and it may be\r\napplied either to a reflecting or a refracting telescope, provided the\r\neye-glass be a convex lens. It is about the 20th part of an inch broad,\r\nand of the thickness of common writing paper, divided into equal parts\r\nby parallel lines, every fifth and tenth of which is a little longer\r\nthan the rest. The simplest way of fixing it is to stick it upon the\r\ndiaphragm which generally stands within the tube, and in the focus of\r\nthe eye-glass. When thus fixed, if you look through the eye-glass, the\r\ndivisions of the micrometrical scale will appear very distinct, unless\r\nthe diaphragm is not exactly in the focus of the eye-glass, in which\r\ncase it must be moved to the proper place;--or, the micrometer may be\r\nplaced exactly in the focus of the eye-lens by the interposition of a\r\ncircular piece of paper, card, or by means of wax. If a person should\r\nnot like to see always the micrometer in the field of the telescope,\r\nthen the micrometrical scale, instead of being fixed to the diaphragm,\r\nmay be fitted to a circular perforated plate of brass, of wood, or even\r\nof paper, which may be occasionally placed upon the said diaphragm. One\r\nof these micrometers, in my possession, which contains 600 divisions in\r\nan inch, is fitted up in a separate eye-tube, with a glass peculiar to\r\nitself, which slides into the eye-piece of the telescope, when its own\r\nproper glass is taken out.\r\n\r\n_To ascertain the value of the divisions of this micrometer._--Direct\r\nthe telescope to the sun, and observe how many divisions of the\r\nmicrometer measure its diameter exactly. Then take out of the Nautical\r\nAlmanack the diameter of the sun for the day on which the observation\r\nis made. Divide it by the above-mentioned number of divisions, and the\r\nquotient is the value of one division of the micrometer. Thus, suppose\r\nthat 26-1/2 divisions of the micrometer measure the diameter of the\r\nsun, and that the Nautical Almanack gives for the measure of the same\r\ndiameter 31´: 22´´, or 1882´´. Divide 1882 by 26.5, and the quotient is\r\n71´´ or 1´: 11´´, which is the value of one division of the micrometer;\r\nthe double of which is the value of two divisions, and so on. The value\r\nof the divisions may likewise be ascertained by the passage of an\r\nequatorial star over a certain number of divisions in a certain time.\r\nThe stars best situated for this purpose are such as the following--δ\r\nin the Whale, R. A. 37°: 3-1/3´, Dec. 37´: 50´´ S; δ in Orion, R. A.\r\n80°: 11´: 42´´, Dec. 28´: 40´´ S; υ in the Lion, R. A. 171°: 25´: 21´´,\r\nDec. 23´: 22´´ N.; η in Virgo R. A. 182°: 10´, Dec. 33´: 27´´ N. But\r\nthe following is the most easy and accurate method of determining the\r\nvalue of the divisions:--\r\n\r\nMark upon a wall or other place the length of _six inches_, which may\r\nbe done by making two dots or lines six inches asunder, or by fixing\r\na six inch ruler upon a stand. Then place the telescope before it,\r\nso that the ruler or six-inch length may be at right angles with the\r\ndirection of the telescope, and just 57 feet 3-1/2 inches distant\r\nfrom the object-glass of the telescope; this done, look through the\r\ntelescope at the ruler, or other extension of six inches, and observe\r\nhow many divisions of the micrometer are equal to it, and that same\r\nnumber of divisions is equal to half a degree, or 30´; and this is all\r\nthat is necessary for the required determination. The reason of which\r\nis, because an extension of six inches subtends an angle of 30´, at the\r\ndistance of 57 feet, 3-1/2 inches, as may be easily calculated from the\r\nrules of plane Trigonometry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 85._]\r\n\r\nFig. 85, exhibits this micrometer scale, but shows it four times larger\r\nthan the real size of one which was adapted to a 3 feet achromatic\r\ntelescope magnifying 84 times. The divisions upon it are the 200ths of\r\nan inch, which reach from one edge of the scale to about the middle of\r\nit, excepting every fifth and tenth division, which are longer. Two\r\ndivisions of this scale are very nearly equal to one minute; and as a\r\nquarter of one of these divisions may be distinguished by estimation,\r\ntherefore an angle of 1/8 of a minute, or of 7-1/2´´ may be measured\r\nwith it. When a telescope magnifies more, the divisions of the\r\nmicrometer must be more minute. When the focus of the eye-glass of the\r\ntelescope is shorter than half an inch, the micrometer may be divided\r\nwith the 500ths of an inch; by means of which, and the telescope\r\nmagnifying about 200 times, one may easily and accurately measure an\r\nangle smaller than half a second. On the other hand, when the telescope\r\ndoes not magnify above 30 times, the divisions need not be so minute.\r\nIn one of Dollond’s pocket telescopes, which, when drawn out for use\r\nis only 14 inches long, a micrometer with the hundredths of an inch\r\nis quite sufficient, and one of its divisions is equal to little less\r\nthan 3 minutes, so that an angle of a minute may be measured by it.\r\nSupposing 11-1/2 of those divisions equal to 30´ or 23 to a degree--any\r\nother angle measured by any other number of divisions, is determined\r\nby proportion. Thus, suppose the diameter of the sun, seen through the\r\nsame telescope, be found equal to 12 divisions, say As 11-1/2 divisions\r\n: are to 30 minutes :: so are 12 divisions : to ((12 × 30)/11.5) 31.3,\r\nwhich is the required diameter of the sun.\r\n\r\n_Practical uses of this Micrometer._--This micrometer may be applied\r\nto the following purposes:--1. For measuring the apparent diameters of\r\nthe sun, moon, and planets. 2. For measuring the apparent distances of\r\nthe satellites from their primaries. 3. For measuring the cusps of the\r\nmoon in eclipses. 4. For measuring the apparent distances between two\r\ncontiguous stars--between a star and a planet--between a star and the\r\nmoon--or between a comet and the contiguous stars, so as to determine\r\nits path. 5. For finding the difference of declination of contiguous\r\nstars, when they have nearly the same R. Ascension. 6. For measuring\r\nthe small elevations or depressions of objects above and below the\r\nhorizon. 7. For measuring the proportional parts of buildings, and\r\nother objects in perspective drawing. 8. For ascertaining whether a\r\nship at sea, or any moving object is coming nearer or going farther\r\noff; for if the angle subtended by the object appears to increase,\r\nit shows that the object is coming nearer, and if the angle appears\r\nto decrease, it indicates that the object is receding from us. 9.\r\nFor ascertaining the real distances of objects of known extension,\r\nand hence to measure heights, depths, and horizontal distances. 10.\r\nFor measuring the real extensions of objects when their distances\r\nare known. 11. For measuring the distance and size of an object when\r\nneither of them is known.\r\n\r\nWhen the micrometer is adapted to those telescopes which have four\r\nglasses in the eye-tube--and _when the eye-tube only is used_, it\r\nmay be applied to the following purposes:--1. For measuring the\r\nreal or lineal dimensions of small objects, instead of the angles.\r\nFor if the tube be unscrewed from the rest of the telescope, and\r\napplied to small objects, it will serve for a microscope, having a\r\nconsiderable magnifying power, as we have already shown, (p. 348);\r\nand the micrometer, in that case, will measure the lineal dimensions\r\nof the object, as the diameter of a hair, the length of a flea, or\r\nthe limbs of an insect. In order to find the value of the divisions\r\nfor this purpose, we need only apply a ruler, divided into tenths\r\nof an inch, to the end of the tube, and, looking through the tube,\r\nobserve how many divisions of the micrometer measure one tenth of an\r\ninch on the ruler, which will give the required value. Thus, if 30\r\ndivisions are equal to 1/10th of an inch, 300 of them must be equal\r\nto 1 inch, and one division is equal to the 300dth part of an inch.\r\n2. For measuring the magnifying power of other telescopes. This is\r\ndone by measuring the diameter of the pencil of light at the eye-end\r\nof the telescope in question. For, if we divide the diameter of the\r\nobject lens by the diameter of this pencil of light, the quotient will\r\nexpress how many times that telescope magnifies in diameter. Thus,\r\nsuppose that 300 divisions of the micrometer are equal to the apparent\r\nextension of 1 inch--that the pencil of light is measured by 4 of these\r\ndivisions--and that the diameter of the object lens measures 1 inch\r\nand 2 tenths:--Multiply 1.2 by 300, and the product 360, divided by 4,\r\ngives 90 for the magnifying power of the telescope.\r\n\r\n_Problems which may be solved by this micrometer._ I. The angle--not\r\nexceeding one degree--which is subtended by an extension of 1 foot,\r\nbeing given, to find its distance from the place of observation:--Rule\r\n1. If the angle be expressed in minutes, say, as the given angle :\r\nis to 60 :: so is 687.55 : to a fourth proportional, which gives the\r\nanswer in inches. 2. If the angle be expressed in seconds, say, As the\r\ngiven angle : is to 3600 :: so is 687.55 to a fourth proportional,\r\nwhich expresses the answer in inches. 3. If the angle be expressed in\r\nminutes and seconds, turn it all into seconds, and proceed as above.\r\nExample, at what distance is a globe of 1 foot in diameter, when it\r\nsubtends an angle of 2 seconds? 2 : 3600 :: 687.55 : (3600 × 687.55)/2\r\n= 1237596 inches, or 103132-1/2 feet = the answer required. II. The\r\nangle which is subtended by any known extension being given, to find\r\nits distance from the place of observation. Rule, Proceed as if the\r\nextension were of one foot, by Problem I, and call the answer B; then\r\nif the extension in question be expressed in inches, say, as 12 inches\r\n: are to that extension :: so is B : to a fourth proportional, which\r\nis the answer in inches. But if the extension in question be expressed\r\nin feet, then we need only multiply it by B, and the product is the\r\nanswer in inches.--Example, At what distance is a man 6 feet high, when\r\nhe appears to subtend an angle of 30´´? By Problem I, if the man were\r\n1 foot high, the distance would be 82506 inches; but as he is 6 feet\r\nhigh, therefore multiply 82506 by 6, and the product is the required\r\ndistance, namely 495036 inches, or 41253 feet.\r\n\r\nFor greater conveniency, especially in travelling, when one has not\r\nthe opportunity of making such calculations, the following two tables\r\nhave been calculated; the first of which shows the distance answering\r\nto any angle from one minute to one degree, which is subtended by a\r\nman whose height is considered an extension of 6 feet, because at a\r\nmean, such is the height of a man when dressed with hat and shoes on.\r\nThese tables may be transcribed on a card, and may be kept always ready\r\nwith a pocket telescope furnished with a micrometer. Their use is to\r\nascertain distances without any calculations; and they are calculated\r\nonly to minutes, because with a pocket telescope and micrometer, it\r\nis not possible to measure an angle more accurately than to a minute.\r\nThus, if we want to measure the extension of a street, let a foot ruler\r\nbe placed at the end of the street; measure the angular appearance of\r\nit, which suppose to be 36´, and in the table we have the required\r\ndistance against 36´, which is 95-1/2 feet. Thus also a man who appears\r\nto be 49´ high, is at the distance of 421 feet. Again, Suppose the\r\ntrunk of a tree which is known to be 3 feet in diameter be observed to\r\nsubtend an angle of 9´-1/2. Take the number answering to 9´ out of the\r\ntable, namely 382, and subtract from it a proportional part for the\r\nhalf minute, namely 19.1, which subtracted from 382, leaves 362.9. This\r\nmultiplied by 3, the diameter of the tree, produces 1087.7 feet = the\r\ndistance from the object end of the telescope.\r\n\r\n  +-----------------------------------++-----------------------------------+\r\n  |       Angles subtended by an      ||       Angles subtended by an      |\r\n  |     extension of _one foot_ at    ||     extension of _six feet_ at    |\r\n  |        different distances.       ||        different distances.       |\r\n  +-------+---------+-------+---------++-------+---------+-------+---------+\r\n  |Angles |Distances|Angles |Distances||Angles |Distances|Angles |Distances|\r\n  |Minutes|in feet. |Minutes|in feet. ||Minutes|in feet. |Minutes|in feet. |\r\n  +-------+---------+-------+---------++-------+---------+-------+---------+\r\n  |   1   |  3438   |   31  |  110.9  ||   1   | 20626.8 |   31  |  665.4  |\r\n  |   2   |  1719   |   32  |  107.4  ||   2   | 10313.  |   32  |  644.5  |\r\n  |   3   |  1146   |   33  |  104.2  ||   3   |  6875.4 |   33  |  625.   |\r\n  |   4   |   859.4 |   34  |  101.1  ||   4   |  5156.5 |   34  |  606.6  |\r\n  |   5   |   687.5 |   35  |  98.2   ||   5   |  4125.2 |   35  |  589.3  |\r\n  |   6   |   572.9 |   36  |  95.5   ||   6   |  3437.7 |   36  |  572.9  |\r\n  |   7   |   491.1 |   37  |  92.9   ||   7   |  2946.6 |   37  |  557.5  |\r\n  |   8   |   429.7 |   38  |  90.4   ||   8   |  2578.2 |   38  |  542.8  |\r\n  |   9   |   382   |   39  |  88.1   ||   9   |  2291.8 |   39  |  528.9  |\r\n  |  10   |   343.7 |   40  |  85.9   ||  10   |  2062.6 |   40  |  515.6  |\r\n  |  11   |   312.5 |   41  |  83.8   ||  11   |  1875.2 |   41  |  503.1  |\r\n  |  12   |   286.5 |   42  |  81.8   ||  12   |  1718.8 |   42  |  491.1  |\r\n  |  13   |   264.4 |   43  |  79.9   ||  13   |  1586.7 |   43  |  479.7  |\r\n  |  14   |   245.5 |   44  |  78.1   ||  14   |  1473.3 |   44  |  468.8  |\r\n  |  15   |   229.2 |   45  |  76.4   ||  15   |  1375.  |   45  |  458.4  |\r\n  |  16   |   214.8 |   46  |  74.7   ||  16   |  1298.1 |   46  |  448.4  |\r\n  |  17   |   202.2 |   47  |  73.1   ||  17   |  1213.3 |   47  |  438.9  |\r\n  |  18   |   191   |   48  |  71.6   ||  18   |  1145.9 |   48  |  429.7  |\r\n  |  19   |   181   |   49  |  70.1   ||  19   |  1085.6 |   49  |  421.   |\r\n  |  20   |   171.8 |   50  |  68.7   ||  20   |  1031.4 |   50  |  412.5  |\r\n  |  21   |   162.7 |   51  |  67.4   ||  21   |   982.2 |   51  |  404.4  |\r\n  |  22   |   156.2 |   52  |  66.1   ||  22   |   937.6 |   52  |  396.7  |\r\n  |  23   |   149.4 |   53  |  64.8   ||  23   |   896.8 |   53  |  389.2  |\r\n  |  24   |   143.2 |   54  |  63.6   ||  24   |   859.4 |   54  |  381.9  |\r\n  |  25   |   137.5 |   55  |  62.5   ||  25   |   825.  |   55  |  375.   |\r\n  |  26   |   132.2 |   56  |  61.4   ||  26   |   793.3 |   56  |  368.3  |\r\n  |  27   |   127.3 |   57  |  60.3   ||  27   |   763.9 |   57  |  361.9  |\r\n  |  28   |   122.7 |   58  |  59.1   ||  28   |   736.6 |   58  |  355.6  |\r\n  |  29   |   118.5 |   59  |  58.2   ||  29   |   711.3 |   59  |  349.6  |\r\n  |  30   |   114.6 |   60  |  57.3   ||  30   |   687.5 |   60  |  343.7  |\r\n  +-------+---------+-------+---------++-------+---------+-------+---------+\r\n\r\nIn this way the distance of a considerably remote object, as a town\r\nor building at 10 or 12 miles distant, may be very nearly determined;\r\nprovided we have the lineal dimensions of a house or other object that\r\nstands at right angles to the line of vision. The breadth of a river,\r\nof an arm of the sea, or the distance of a light house, whose elevation\r\nabove the sea or any other point, is known, may likewise in this manner\r\nbe easily determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE EQUATORIAL TELESCOPE, OR PORTABLE OBSERVATORY.\r\n\r\nThe equatorial instrument is intended to answer a number of useful\r\npurposes in Practical Astronomy, independently of any particular\r\nobservatory. Besides answering the general purpose of a Quadrant, a\r\nTransit instrument, a Theodolite, and an Azimuth instrument--it is\r\nalmost the only instrument adapted for viewing the stars and planets\r\n_in the day-time_, and for following them in their apparent diurnal\r\nmotions. It may be made use of in any steady room or place, and\r\nperforms most of the useful problems in astronomical science.\r\n\r\nThe basis of all equatorial instruments is a revolving axis, placed\r\nparallel to the axis of the earth, by which an attached telescope is\r\nmade to follow a star or other celestial body in the arc of its diurnal\r\nrevolution, without the trouble of repeated adjustments for changes of\r\nelevation, which quadrants and circles with vertical and horizontal\r\naxes require. Such an instrument is not only convenient for many useful\r\nand interesting purposes in celestial observations, but is essentially\r\nrequisite in certain cases, particularly in examining and measuring the\r\nrelative positions of two contiguous bodies, or in determining the\r\ndiameters of the planets, when the spider’s-line micrometer is used.\r\n\r\nChristopher Scheiner is supposed to have been the first astronomer who,\r\nin the year 1620, made use of a polar axis, but without any appendage\r\nof graduated circles. It was not, however, till the middle of the\r\nlast century, that any instruments of this description, worthy of the\r\nname, were attempted to be constructed. In 1741, Mr. Henry Hindley, a\r\nclock-maker in York, added to the polar axis, an equatorial plate, a\r\nquadrant of altitude, and declination semicircle; but when this piece\r\nof mechanism was sent to London for sale in 1748, it remained unsold\r\nfor the space of 13 years. Mr. Short, the optician, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, for 1750, a ‘description of an equatorial\r\ntelescope,’ which was of the reflecting kind, and was mounted over a\r\ncombination of circles and semicircles, which were strong enough to\r\nsupport a tube, and a speculum of the Gregorian construction 18 inches\r\nin focal length. This instrument consisted of a somewhat cumbersome\r\nand expensive piece of machinery--a representation of which may be\r\nseen in volume III of Martin’s ‘_Philosophia Britannica_, or system of\r\nthe Newtonian philosophy.’ Various modifications of this instrument\r\nhave since been made by Nairne, Dollond, Ramsden, Troughton, and\r\nother artists; but even at the present period, it has never come into\r\nvery general use, though it is one of the most pleasant and useful\r\ninstruments connected with astronomical observations.\r\n\r\nAs many of these instruments are somewhat complicated, and very\r\nexpensive, I shall direct the attention of the reader solely to\r\none which I consider as the most simple--which may be purchased\r\nat a moderate expence, and is sufficiently accurate for _general_\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 86._]\r\n\r\nThis instrument consists of the following parts: A _horizontal circle_\r\nEF (fig. 86.) divided into four quadrants of 90 degrees each. There is\r\na fixed nonius at N; and the circle is capable of being turned round\r\non an axis. In the centre of the horizontal circle is fixed a strong\r\nupright pillar, which supports the centre of a vertical semicircle\r\nAB, divided into two quadrants of 90 degrees each. This is called the\r\n_semicircle of altitude_, and may, at any time, serve the purpose of\r\na quadrant in measuring either altitudes or depressions. It has a\r\nnonius plate at K. At right angles to the plane of this semicircle, the\r\n_equatorial circle_ MN is firmly fixed. It represents the equator, and\r\nis divided into twice 12 hours, every hour being divided into 12 parts\r\nof 5 minutes each. Upon the equatorial circle moves another circle,\r\nwith a chamfered edge, carrying a nonius by which the divisions on\r\nthe equatorial may be read off to single minutes; and at right angles\r\nto this moveable circle is fixed the _semicircle of declination_ D,\r\ndivided into two quadrants of 90 degrees each. The telescope PO, is\r\nsurmounted above this circle, and is fixed to an index moveable on the\r\nsemicircle of declination, and carries a nonius opposite to Q. The\r\ntelescope is furnished with 2 or 3 Huygenian eye-pieces, and likewise\r\nwith a diagonal eye-piece for viewing objects near the zenith. Lastly,\r\nthere are 2 spirit levels fixed on the horizontal circle, at right\r\nangles to each other, by means of which this circle is made perfectly\r\nlevel when observations are to be made.\r\n\r\n_To adjust the equatorial for observation._ Set the instrument\r\non a firm support. Then _to adjust the levels and the horizontal\r\ncircle_:--Turn the horizontal circle till the beginning O of the\r\ndivisions coincides with the middle stroke of the nonius, or near it.\r\nIn this situation one of the levels will be found to lie either in a\r\nright line joining the 2 foot screws which are nearest the nonius, or\r\nelse parallel to such a right line. By means of the 2 last screws,\r\ncause the bubble in the level to become stationary in the middle of\r\nthe glass; then turn the horizontal circle half round, by bringing\r\nthe other O to the nonius; and if the bubble remains in the middle,\r\nas before, the level is well-adjusted; if it does not, correct the\r\nposition of the level, by turning one or both of the screws which\r\npass through its ends, till the bubble has moved half the distance it\r\nought to come to reach the middle, and cause it to move the other half\r\nby turning the foot-screws already mentioned. Return the horizontal\r\ncircle to its first position, and if the adjustments have been well\r\nmade, the bubble will remain in the middle: if otherwise, the process\r\nmust be repeated till it bears this proof of its accuracy. Then turn\r\nthe horizontal circle till 90° stands opposite to the nonius; and by\r\nthe foot-screw,immediately opposite the other 90°, cause the bubble of\r\nthe same level to stand in the middle of the glass. Lastly, by its own\r\nproper screws set the other level so that its bubble may occupy the\r\nmiddle of its glass.\r\n\r\n_To adjust the line of sight._ Set the nonius on the _declination_\r\nsemicircle at O, the nonius on the horary circle at VI, and the nonius\r\non the semicircle of altitude at 90. Look through the telescope towards\r\nsome part of the horizon, where there is a diversity of remote objects.\r\nLevel the horizontal circle, and then observe what object appears in\r\nthe centre of the cross-wires, or in the centre of the field of view,\r\nif there be no wires. Reverse the semicircle of altitude, so that the\r\nother 90° may apply to the nonius; taking care, at the same time, that\r\nthe other three noniuses continue at the same parts of their respective\r\ngraduations as before. If the remote object continues to be seen on the\r\ncentre of the cross-wires, the line of sight is truly adjusted.\r\n\r\n_To find the correction to be applied to observations by the\r\nsemicircle of altitude._ Set the nonius on the declination-semicircle\r\nto 0, and the nonius on the horary circle to XII; direct the telescope\r\nto any fixed and distant object, by moving the horizontal circle and\r\nsemicircle of altitude, and nothing else; note the degree and minute\r\nof altitude or depression; reverse the declination-semicircle, by\r\ndirecting the nonius on the horary circle to the opposite XII; direct\r\nthe telescope again to the same object, by means of the horizontal\r\ncircle and semicircle of altitude, as before. If its altitude or\r\ndepression be the same as was observed in the other position, no\r\ncorrection will be required; but, if otherwise, half the difference of\r\nthe two angles is the correction to be added to all observations made\r\nwith that quadrant, or half of the semicircle which shows the least\r\nangle, or to be subtracted from all the observations made with the\r\nother quadrant, or half of the semicircle. When the levels and other\r\nadjustments are once truly made, they will be preserved in order for a\r\nlength of time, if not deranged by violence; and the correction to be\r\napplied to the semicircle of altitude is a constant quantity.\r\n\r\n_Description of the nonius._ The nonius--sometimes called the\r\n_vernier_--is a name given to a device for subdividing the arcs of\r\nquadrants and other astronomical instruments. It depends on the\r\nsimple circumstance, that if any line be divided into equal parts,\r\nthe length of each part will be greater, the fewer the divisions; and\r\ncontrariwise, it will be less in proportion as those divisions are\r\nmore numerous. Thus, in the equatorial now described, the distance\r\nbetween the two extreme strokes on the nonius is exactly equal to 11\r\ndegrees on the limb, but that it is divided into 12 equal parts. Each\r\nof these last parts will therefore be shorter than the _degree_ on the\r\nlimb in the proportion of 11 to 12, that is to say, it will be 1/12th\r\npart, or 5 minutes shorter. Consequently, if the middle stroke be set\r\nprecisely opposite to any degree, the relative positions of the nonius\r\nand the limb must be altered 5 minutes of a degree, before either of\r\nthe two adjacent strokes next the middle on the nonius, can be brought\r\nto coincide with the nearest stroke of a degree; and so likewise the\r\nsecond stroke on the nonius will require a change of 10 minutes, the\r\nthird of 15, and so on to 30, when the middle line of the nonius will\r\nbe seen to be equi-distant between 2 of the strokes on the limb; after\r\nwhich the lines on the opposite side of the nonius will coincide in\r\nsuccession with the strokes on the limb. It is clear from this, that\r\nwhenever the middle stroke of the nonius does not stand precisely\r\nopposite to any degree, the odd minutes--or distance between it and\r\nthe degree immediately preceding--may be known by the _number_ of the\r\nstroke marked on the nonius, which coincides with any of the strokes on\r\nthe limb.[38] In some instruments the nonius-plate has its divisions\r\nfewer than the number of parts on the limb to which it is equal; but\r\nwhen once a clear idea of the principle of any nonius is obtained, it\r\nwill be easy to transfer it to any other mode in which this instrument\r\nis contrived.\r\n\r\n_To find by this equatorial the_ MERIDIAN LINE, and the time,\r\nFROM ONE OBSERVATION OF THE SUN. In order to this it is\r\nrequisite that the sun’s declination, and the latitude of the place\r\nbe known. The declination of the sun may be found, for every day,\r\nin the Nautical Almanack, or any other astronomical Ephemeris; and\r\nthe latitude of the place may be found by means of the semicircle of\r\naltitude, when the telescope is directed to the sun or a known fixed\r\nstar. It is likewise requisite to make the observation when the azimuth\r\nand altitude of the sun alter quickly; and this is generally the case,\r\nthe farther that luminary is from the meridian:--Therefore, at the\r\ndistance of 3 or 4 hours, either before or after noon, (in summer)\r\nadjust the horizontal circle; set the semicircle of altitude, so that\r\nits nonius may stand at the co-latitude of the place; lay the plane\r\nof the last-mentioned semicircle in the meridian, by estimation, its\r\n0 being directed towards the depressed pole; place the nonius of the\r\ndeclination semicircle to the declination, whether north or south. Then\r\ndirect the telescope towards the sun, partly by moving the declination\r\nsemicircle on the axis of the equatorial circle, and partly by moving\r\nthe horizontal circle on its own axis. There is but one position of\r\nthese which will admit of the sun being seen exactly in the middle\r\nof the field of view. When this position is obtained, the nonius on\r\nthe equatorial circle shows _the apparent time_, and _the circle of\r\naltitude is in the plane of the meridian_. When this position is\r\nascertained, the meridian may be settled by a land-mark at a distance.\r\n\r\nWith an equatorial instrument, nearly similar to that now described, I\r\nformerly made a series of ‘_day observations_ on the celestial bodies,’\r\nwhich were originally published in vol. 36 of ‘Nicholson’s Journal of\r\nNatural Philosophy,’ and which occupy twenty pages of that journal.\r\nSome of these observations I shall lay before the reader, after having\r\nexplained the manner in which they are made.\r\n\r\nThe instrument was made by Messrs. W. and S. Jones, opticians,\r\nHolborn, London. The telescope which originally accompanied the\r\ninstrument was an achromatic refractor, its object-glass being 8-1/2\r\ninches focal distance, and one inch diameter. This telescope, not\r\nadmitting sufficiently high magnifying powers for the observations\r\nintended, was afterwards thrown aside for another telescope, having an\r\nobject-glass 20 inches focal length, and 1-3/4 inch diameter, which was\r\nattached to the equatorial machinery in place of the small telescope.\r\nIt was furnished with magnifying powers of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 100\r\ntimes. The instrument was placed on a firm pedestal about three feet\r\nhigh. The feet of this pedestal had short iron pikes, which slipped\r\ninto corresponding holes in the floor of the apartment adjacent to a\r\nsouth window, so that when the direction of the meridian was found, and\r\nthe circles properly adjusted, the instrument was in no danger of being\r\nshifted from this position. Though this instrument generally stood\r\nfronting the southern part of the heavens, yet the equatorial part,\r\nalong with the telescope, could occasionally be removed to another\r\nposition fronting the north and north-west, for observing the stars in\r\nthose quarters.\r\n\r\n_Manner of observing stars and planets in the day-time by the\r\nequatorial._ Before such observations can be made, the semicircle of\r\naltitude must be placed in the meridian, and the degree and minute\r\npointed out by the nonius on the horizontal circle, when in this\r\nposition, noted down in a book, so that it may be placed again in the\r\nsame position, should any derangement afterwards happen. The semicircle\r\nof altitude must be set to the co-latitude of the place; that is, to\r\nwhat the latitude wants of 90°. Suppose the latitude of the place\r\nof observation be 52° 30´ north, this latitude subtracted from 90°,\r\nleaves 37° 30´ for the co-latitude; and therefore, the semicircle of\r\naltitude--on which the equatorial circle is fixed--must be elevated to\r\n37° 30´, and then the equatorial circle on the instrument coincides\r\nwith the equator in the heavens. Lastly, the telescope must be adjusted\r\non the declination semicircle, so as exactly to correspond with the\r\ndeclination of the heavenly body to be viewed. If the body is in the\r\nequator, the telescope is set by the index at 0 on the semicircle of\r\ndeclination, or at the middle point between the two quadrants, and\r\nthen when the telescope, along with the semicircle of declination, is\r\nmoved from right to left, or the contrary, it describes an arc of the\r\nequator. If the declination of the body be north, the telescope is\r\nelevated to the northern division of the semicircle; if south, to the\r\nsouthern part of it.\r\n\r\nThese adjustments being made, take the difference between the Right\r\nAscension of the sun and the body to be observed; and if the Right\r\nAscension of the body be greater than that of the sun, subtract the\r\ndifference from the time of observation; if not, add to the time of\r\nobservation.[39] The remainder in one case, or the sum in the other,\r\nwill be the hour and minute to which the nonius on the equatorial\r\ncircle is to be set; which being done, the telescope will point to the\r\nstar or planet to whose declination the instrument is adjusted. When\r\nthe heavenly body is thus found, it may be followed, in its diurnal\r\ncourse, for hours, or as long as it remains above the horizon. For as\r\nthe diurnal motion of a star is parallel to the equator, the motion of\r\nthe telescope on the equatorial circle, will always be in the star’s\r\ndiurnal arc; and should it have left the field of the telescope for any\r\nconsiderable time, it may be again recovered, by moving the telescope\r\nonward according to the time which elapsed since it was visible in the\r\nfield of view. We may illustrate what has been now stated by an example\r\nor two. Suppose on the 30th April, 1841, at 1 o’clock, P.M. we\r\nwished to see the star _Aldebaran_. The Right Ascension of this star\r\nis 4^h 27^m; and the sun’s Right Ascension for that day at noon, as\r\nfound in ‘White’s Ephemeris,’ or the ‘Nautical Almanack,’ is 2^h 30^m.\r\nSubtract this last number from 4^h 27^m, and the remainder 1^h 57^m,\r\nshows that the star comes to the meridian on that day at 57 minutes\r\npast 1 o’clock, P.M. And as the time of observation is 1\r\nP.M., the nonius which moves on the equatorial circle must be\r\nset to 3 minutes past XI, as the star is at that hour 57 minutes from\r\nthe meridian. The declination of Aldebaran is 16° 11´ north, to which\r\npoint on the semicircle of declination, the telescope must be adjusted,\r\nand then the star will be visible in the field of view. Again, suppose\r\nwe wished to observe the planet Venus on the 1st January, 1842, at\r\n12 o’clock noon. The sun’s Right Ascension on that day is 18^h 46^m,\r\nand that of Venus 17^h 41^m, from which the sun’s Right Ascension\r\nbeing subtracted, the remainder is 22^h 55^m, or 55 minutes past 10,\r\nA.M. Here, as the Right Ascension of Venus is too small to\r\nhave the sun’s Right Ascension taken from it, we borrow 24 hours, and\r\nreckon the remainder from XII at noon. As the planet at 12 noon, is 1\r\nhour 5 minutes past the meridian, the nonius on the equatorial circle\r\nmust be set to that point, and the telescope adjusted to 23° 6´ of\r\nsouth declination, which is the declination of Venus for that day, when\r\nthis planet will appear in the field of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Observations on the fixed stars and planets, made in the day-time by\r\nthe Equatorial._\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of illustrating the descriptions now given, and for\r\naffording some information respecting celestial day observations,\r\nI shall select a few of the observations above alluded to, which I\r\nformerly published in Nicholson’s Journal, along with a few others\r\nwhich have been since made. These observations were made with a view to\r\ndetermine the following particulars:--1. What stars and planets may be\r\nconveniently seen in the day-time, when the sun is above the horizon?\r\n2. What degrees of magnifying power are requisite for distinguishing\r\nthem? 3. How near their conjunction with the sun they may be seen?\r\nand 4. Whether the diminution of the aperture of the object-glass of\r\nthe telescope, or the increase of magnifying power, conduces most to\r\nrender a star or a planet visible in day-light. Having never seen such\r\nobservations recorded in books of astronomy or in scientific journals,\r\nI was induced to continue them, almost every clear day for nearly a\r\nyear, in order to determine the points now specified. Some of the\r\nresults are stated in the following pages.\r\n\r\n_Observations on fixed stars of the first magnitude._ April 23, 1813,\r\nat 10^h 15^m, A.M., the sun being 5-1/2 hours above the\r\nhorizon. Saw the star _Vega_, or α Lyræ, very distinctly with a power\r\nof 30 times. Having contracted the aperture of the object-glass to\r\n9/10 of an inch, saw it on a darker ground, but not more plainly than\r\nbefore. Having contracted the aperture still farther, to half an inch,\r\nI perceived the star, but not so distinctly as before. The sky being\r\nvery clear, and the star in a quarter of the heavens nearly opposite\r\nto the sun, I diminished the magnifying power to 15, and could still\r\nperceive the star, but indistinctly; it was just perceptible. August\r\n23, at 0^h 12^m, P.M., saw the star _Capella_, or α _Aurigæ_,\r\nwith a power of 60, and immediately afterwards with a power of 30;\r\nthe aperture undiminished. With this last power it appeared extremely\r\ndistinct, but not so brilliant and splendid as with the former power.\r\nHaving diminished the aperture to 9/10 of an inch, it appeared on a\r\ndarker ground, though in the former case, it was equally perceptible.\r\nA few minutes afterwards, could distinguish it with a power of 15, the\r\naperture being contracted to half an inch. It appeared very small;\r\nit was with difficulty the eye could fix upon it in the field of the\r\ntelescope; but when it was once perceived, its motion across the field\r\nof view could be readily followed. It could not be perceived, when the\r\ndiminished aperture was removed. The sun was then shining in meridian\r\nsplendour.\r\n\r\nAugust 10th, 9^h 30^m, A.M. Saw the star Sirius with a power\r\nof 60, the aperture contracted to 9/10 inch. Saw it likewise when\r\nthe aperture was diminished to half an inch, but not so distinctly\r\nas through the aperture of inch. Having put on a power of 30, could\r\ndistinguish it distinctly enough through each of the former apertures,\r\nand likewise when they were removed; but somewhat more distinctly\r\nwith the apertures of nine-tenths and half an inch than without them.\r\nAt this time the star was 2^h 42^m in time of Right Ascension west\r\nof the sun, having an elevation above the horizon of about 17° 10’;\r\nthe sun shining bright, and the sky very much enlightened in that\r\nquarter of the heavens where the star appeared. There was also a\r\nconsiderable undulation of the air, which is generally the case in\r\nthe hot mornings of summer--which renders a star more difficult to\r\nbe perceived than in the afternoon, especially when it is viewed at\r\na low altitude. June 4th, 1^h 30^m, P.M., saw Sirius with a\r\npower of 30 with great distinctness, the aperture not contracted. The\r\nstar was then within 1^h 50^m, in time of Right Ascension east from\r\nthe sun. August 24th, 9^h 5^m, A.M., saw the star _Procyon_,\r\nor α _Canis-Minoris_ distinctly with a power of 60, the aperture not\r\ncontracted. When diminished to 9/10 inch, it appeared rather more\r\ndistinct, as the ground on which it was seen was darker. With a power\r\nof 30, and the aperture contracted to 9/10 inch, could perceive it, but\r\nsomewhat indistinctly. When the equatorial motion was performed, in\r\norder to keep it in the field of view, it was sometime before the eye\r\ncould again fix upon it. When the aperture was diminished to half an\r\ninch, it could not be perceived. Saw it when both the apertures were\r\nremoved, but rather more distinctly with the aperture of 9/10 inch. The\r\ndifference in the result of this observation, from that of Capella,\r\nabove stated, was owing to the star’s proximity to the sun, and the\r\nconsequent illumination of the sky in that quarter where it appeared.\r\nIts difference in Right Ascension from that of the sun was then about\r\n2^h 5^m of time, and its difference of declination about 4° 50´.[40]\r\nThis star may be considered as one of those which rank between the\r\nfirst and second magnitudes.\r\n\r\nSimilar observations to the above were made and frequently repeated\r\non the stars Rigel, Aldebaran, Betelguese Cor-Leonis and other stars\r\nof the first magnitude, which gave nearly the same results. The stars\r\nAltares and Fomalhaut are not so easily distinguished, on account of\r\ntheir great southern declination, and consequent low elevation above\r\nthe horizon. The following observation on _Arcturus_ may be added.\r\nJune 3rd, observed Arcturus very distinctly, a little before 7 in the\r\nevening, the sun being about 1^h 40^m above the horizon, and shining\r\nbright--with a power of 15; the aperture not contracted. It appeared\r\nvery small but distinct. This star is easily distinguishable at any\r\ntime of the day with a power of 30.\r\n\r\n_Observations on stars of the second magnitude._ May 5, 1813, at 6^h,\r\nP.M.; the sun being an hour and three quarters above the\r\nhorizon. Saw _Alphard_, or α Hydræ, a star of the second magnitude,\r\nwith a power of 60; the aperture diminished to 9/10 inch. A few minutes\r\nafterwards could perceive it, but indistinctly, with a power of 30,\r\nthe aperture contracted as above. It could not be seen very distinctly\r\nwith this power, till about half an hour before sun-set. It was then\r\nseen rather more distinctly when the aperture was contracted than\r\nwithout the contraction. May 7th. Saw the star _Deneb_, or β _Leonis_,\r\ndistinctly with a power of 60, about an hour and a half before sun-set.\r\nAugust 20th. Saw Ras Alkague, or α _Ophiuchi_, at 4^h 40^m, _P.M._,\r\nwith a power of 100, the sun being nearly 3 hours above the horizon,\r\nand shining bright. Perceived it about an hour afterwards, with a\r\npower of 60--with the aperture contracted to 9/10 inch, and also when\r\nthis contraction was removed. The star was seen nearly as distinctly\r\nin the last case as in the first. August 27, 5^h, _P.M._, the same\r\nstar appeared quite distinct with a power of 60, the aperture not\r\ncontracted. It did not appear more distinct when the aperture was\r\ncontracted to 9/10 inch. The sun was then more than 2 hours above the\r\nhorizon. August 28th. Saw the star _Pollux_, or β _Gemini_, 2 hours\r\nafter sun-rise with a power of 60, aperture undiminished. November\r\n12th, 1_{h} 30´, _P.M._ Saw the star _Altair_, or α _Aquilæ_, with an\r\n8-1/2 inch telescope, 1 inch aperture, carrying a power of 45, the\r\naperture not contracted. Having contracted the aperture a little, it\r\nappeared somewhat less distinct. This star is reckoned by some to\r\nbelong to the class of stars of the first magnitude; but in White’s\r\n‘Ephemeris’ and other Almanacks, it is generally marked as being of the\r\nsecond magnitude. It forms a kind of medium between stars of the 1st\r\nand of the 2nd magnitude.\r\n\r\nSimilar observations, giving the same results, were made on the stars\r\nBellatrix, Orion’s Girdle, α Andromedæ, α Pegasi, Alioth, Benetnasch,\r\nNorth Crown, or α Coronæ Borealis, and various other stars of the same\r\nmagnitude.\r\n\r\nFrom the above and several hundreds of similar observations, _the\r\nfollowing conclusions_ are deduced.\r\n\r\n1. That a magnifying power of 30 times is sufficient for distinguishing\r\na fixed star of the first magnitude, even at noon-day, at any season\r\nof the year; provided it have a moderate degree of elevation above the\r\nhorizon, and be not within 30° or 40° of the sun’s body. Also, that, by\r\na magnifying power of 15, a star of this class may be distinguished,\r\nwhen the sun is not above an hour and a half above the horizon. But,\r\nin every case, higher powers are to be preferred. Powers of 45 or 60,\r\nparticularly the last, were found to answer best in most cases, as with\r\nsuch powers the eye could fix on the star with ease, as soon as it\r\nentered the field of the telescope.\r\n\r\n2. That most of the stars of the 2nd magnitude may be seen with a power\r\nof 60, when the sun is not much more than 2 hours above the horizon;\r\nand, at any time of the day, the brightest stars of this class may be\r\nseen with a power of 100, when the sky is serene, and the star not too\r\nnear the quarter in which the sun appears.\r\n\r\n3. That, in every instance, an increase of magnifying power has\r\nthe principal effect in rendering a star easily perceptible. That\r\ndiminution of aperture, in most cases, produces a very slight effect;\r\nin some cases, none at all; and, when the aperture is contracted beyond\r\na certain limit, it produces a hurtful effect. The cases in which a\r\nmoderate contraction is useful, are the two following:--1. When the\r\nstar appears in a bright part of the sky, not far from that quarter in\r\nwhich the sun appears. 2. When an object-glass of a large aperture, and\r\na small degree of magnifying power, is used. In almost every instance\r\nthe contraction of the object-glass of the 8-1/2-inch telescope with\r\na power of 45, had a hurtful effect. But when the 20-inch telescope\r\ncarried a power of only 15, the contraction served to render the object\r\nmore perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Observations on the Planets made in the day-time._\r\n\r\nSome of the planets are not so easily distinguished in the day-time as\r\nthe fixed stars of the first magnitude. The one which is most easily\r\ndistinguished at all times, is the planet Venus.\r\n\r\n1. _Observations on Venus._ My observations on this planet commenced\r\nabout the end of August, 1812, about three or four weeks after its\r\ninferior conjunction. About that period, between ten and eleven in the\r\nforenoon, with a power of 45, it appeared as a beautiful crescent,\r\nquite distinct and well-defined, with a lustre similar to that of the\r\nmoon about sun-set, but of a whiter colour. The view of its surface and\r\nphase was fully more distinct and satisfactory than what is obtained\r\nin the evening after sun-set; for, being at a high elevation, the\r\nundulation near the horizon did not affect the distinctness of vision.\r\nThe planet was then very distinctly seen with a power of 7 times, when\r\nit appeared like a star of the first or second magnitude. I traced the\r\nvariation of its phases, almost every clear day, till the month of May,\r\n1813. As at that time, it was not far from its superior conjunction\r\nwith the sun, I wished to ascertain how near its conjunction with that\r\nluminary it might be seen; and particularly whether it might not be\r\npossible, in certain cases, to see it at the moment of its conjunction.\r\n\r\nThe expressions of all astronomical writers previous to this period,\r\nwhen describing the phases of Venus, either directly assert, or,\r\nat least imply, that it is _impossible_ to see that planet, in any\r\ninstance, at the time of its superior conjunction. This is the language\r\nof Dr. Long, Dr. Gregory, Dr. Brewster, Ferguson, Adams, B. Martin, and\r\nmost other writers on the science of astronomy. How far such language\r\nis correct will appear from the following observations and remarks.\r\n\r\nApril 24, 1813, 10^h 50´ A.M. Observed Venus with a power of\r\n30, the aperture not contracted. She was then about 31 minutes, in\r\ntime, of right ascension, distant from the sun. Their difference of\r\ndeclination 3° 59´. She appeared distinct and well-defined. With a\r\npower of 100, could distinguish her gibbous phase. May 1st, 10^h 20^m,\r\nA.M. Viewed this planet with a power of 60; the aperture not\r\ncontracted. It appeared distinct. Saw it about the same time with\r\na power of 15, the aperture being contracted to 9/10 inch. Having\r\ncontracted the aperture to 1/2 inch, saw it more distinctly. When the\r\ncontracted apertures were removed, the planet could with difficulty be\r\ndistinguished, on account of the direct rays of the sun striking on\r\nthe inside of the tube of the telescope. The sun was shining bright,\r\nand the planet about 25´ of time in R.A. west of his centre, their\r\ndifference of declination being 3° 7´. May 7th, 10^h, A.M.\r\nSaw Venus distinctly with a power of 60, the sun shining bright. It\r\nwas then about 19´ in time of R.A. and 4° 27´ in longitude west of the\r\nsun; their difference of declination being 2° 18´. I found a diminution\r\nof aperture particularly useful when viewing the planet at this time,\r\neven when the higher powers were applied. This was the last observation\r\nI had an opportunity of making prior to the conjunction of Venus with\r\nthe sun, which happened on May 25th, at 9^h 30^m, A.M. Its\r\ngeocentric latitude at that time being about 16´ south, the planet must\r\nhave passed almost close by the sun’s southern limb. Cloudy weather for\r\nnearly a month after the last observation, prevented any further views\r\nof the planet, when it was in that part of the heavens which was within\r\nthe range of the instrument. The first day that proved favourable after\r\nit had passed the superior conjunction, was June 5th. The following is\r\nthe memorandum of the observation then taken.\r\n\r\nJune 5th, 9^h, A.M. Adjusted the Equatorial Telescope for\r\nviewing the planet Venus, but it could not be perceived, on account\r\nof the direct rays of the sun entering the tube of the telescope.\r\nI contrived an apparatus for screening his rays, but could not get\r\nit conveniently to move along with the telescope; and therefore\r\ndetermined to wait till past eleven, when the top of the window of the\r\nplace of observation would intercept the solar rays. At 11^h 20^m,\r\nA.M., just as the sun had passed the line of sight from the\r\neye to the top of the window, and his body was eclipsed by it, I was\r\ngratified with a tolerably distinct view of the planet, with a power\r\nof 60. The aperture being contracted to 9/10 inch. The distinctness\r\nincreased as the sun retired, till, in two or three minutes, the planet\r\nappeared perfectly well-defined. Saw it immediately afterwards, with\r\na power of 30, the aperture contracted as before. Saw it also quite\r\ndistinctly with a power of 15; but it could not be distinguished with\r\nthis power, when the contracted aperture was removed. At this time\r\nVenus was just 3° in longitude, or about 13´ in time of R.A. east of\r\nthe sun’s centre, and of course only about 2-3/4 degrees from his\r\neastern limb; the difference of their declination being 27´, and the\r\nplanet’s latitude 11´ north.\r\n\r\nSeveral years afterwards, I obtained views of this planet, when\r\nconsiderably nearer the sun’s margin than as stated in the above\r\nobservation, particularly on the 16th October, 1819, when Venus was\r\nseen when only 6 days and 19 hours past the time of the superior\r\nconjunction. At that time its distance from the sun’s eastern limb\r\nwas only 1° 28´ 42´´. A subsequent observation proved that Venus can\r\nbe seen when only 1° 27´, from the sun’s margin--which I consider as\r\napproximating to the nearest distance from the sun at which this\r\nplanet is distinctly visible.--I shall only state farther the two or\r\nthree following observations.\r\n\r\nJune 7th, 1813, 10^h, A.M. Saw Venus with a power of 60, the\r\naperture being contracted to 9/10 inch--the direct rays of the sun\r\n_not being intercepted by the top of the window_. The aperture having\r\nbeing further contracted to 1/2 inch, could perceive her, but not quite\r\nso distinctly. When the contractions were removed, she could scarcely\r\nbe seen. She was then 3° 33´ in longitude, and nearly 15 minutes in\r\ntime of R.A. distant from the sun’s centre. Some fleeces of clouds\r\nhaving moved across the field of view, she was seen remarkably distinct\r\nin the interstices--the sun at the same time, being partly obscured\r\nby them.--August 19th, 1^h 10´, P.M. Viewed Venus with a\r\nmagnifying power of 100. Could perceive her surface and gibbous phase\r\nalmost as distinctly as when the sun is below the horizon. She appeared\r\nbright, steady in her light, and well defined, without that glare and\r\ntremulous appearance she exhibits in the evening when near the horizon.\r\nShe was then nearly on the meridian. On the whole, such a view of this\r\nplanet is as satisfactory, if not preferable, to those views we obtain\r\nwith an ordinary telescope in the evening, when it is visible to the\r\nnaked eye.\r\n\r\nAll the particulars above stated have been confirmed by many subsequent\r\nobservations continued throughout a series of years. I shall state only\r\ntwo recent observations which show that Venus may be seen somewhat\r\nnearer the sun than what is deduced from the preceding observations,\r\nand at the point of its superior conjunction. March 10th, 1842,\r\nobserved the planet Venus, then very near the sun, at 19 minutes past\r\n11, A.M. It had passed the point of its superior conjunction\r\nwith the sun, on the 5th March, at 1^h 19^m, P.M. The\r\ndifference of right ascension between the sun and the planet was then\r\nabout 6-1/2 minutes of time, or about 1° 37-1/2´, and it was only about\r\n1° 21´ distant from the sun’s eastern limb. It appeared quite distinct\r\nand well-defined, and might perhaps have been seen on the preceding\r\nday, had the observation been then made.--The following observation\r\nshows that Venus may be seen still nearer the sun than in the preceding\r\nobservations, and even _at the moment of its superior_ conjunction. On\r\nthe 2nd of October, 1843, this planet passed the point of its superior\r\nconjunction with the sun, at 4^h 15^m, P.M. At two o’clock,\r\nP.M.--only two hours before the conjunction, I perceived the\r\nplanet distinctly, and kept it in view for nearly ten minutes, till\r\nsome dense clouds intercepted the view. It appeared tolerably distinct\r\nand well-defined, though not brilliant, and with a round full face,\r\nand its apparent path was distinctly traced several times across the\r\nfield of view of the telescope. I perceived it afterwards, about half\r\npast four, P.M., only a few minutes after it had passed the\r\npoint of conjunction, on which occasion it appeared less distinct than\r\nin the preceding observation, owing to the low altitude of the planet,\r\nbeing then only a few degrees above the horizon. The observations,\r\nin this instance, were made not with an equatorial instrument, which\r\nI generally use in such observations, but with a good achromatic\r\ntelescope 44-1/2 inches focal distance, mounted on a common tripod,\r\nwith a terrestrial power of 95 times. A conical tube about ten inches\r\nlong was fixed on the object-end of the telescope, at the extremity of\r\nwhich an aperture, 1-1/2 inch diameter was placed, so as to intercept,\r\nas much as possible, the direct ingress of the solar rays. The top of\r\nthe upper sash of the window of the place of observation was likewise\r\nso adjusted as to intercept the greater part of the sun’s rays from\r\nentering the tube of the telescope. The sun’s declination at that time\r\nwas 3° 26´ south, and that of Venus 2° 12´ south; consequently, the\r\ndifference of declination was 1° 14´ = the distance of Venus from the\r\nsun’s centre; and as the sun’s diameter was about 16´, Venus was then\r\nonly 58´ from the sun’s northern limb, or 6´ less than two diameters of\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThis is the nearest approximation to the sun at which I have ever\r\nbeheld this planet, and it demonstrates that Venus may be seen even\r\nwhen within a degree of the sun’s margin; and it is perhaps the nearest\r\nposition to that luminary in which this planet can be distinctly\r\nperceived. It shows that the light reflected from the surface of Venus\r\nis far more brilliant than that reflected from the surface of our moon;\r\nfor no trace of this nocturnal luminary can be perceived, even when at\r\na much greater distance from the sun, nor is there any other celestial\r\nbody that can be seen within the limit now stated. This is the first\r\nobservation, so far as my information extends, of Venus having been\r\nseen at the time of her superior conjunction.[41]\r\n\r\nThe practical conclusion from this observation is, that, at the\r\nsuperior conjunction of this planet, when its distance from the sun’s\r\nmargin is not less than 58´, _its polar and equatorial diameter may be\r\nmeasured_ by a micrometer, when it will be determined whether or not\r\nVenus be of a _spheroidal_ figure. The Earth, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn\r\nare found to be not spheres but _spheroids_, having their polar shorter\r\nthan their equatorial diameters. But the true figure of Venus has never\r\nyet been ascertained, because it is only at the superior conjunction\r\nthat she presents a full enlightened hemisphere, and when both\r\ndiameters can be measured, except at the time when she transits the\r\nsun’s disk, which happens only twice in the course of 120 years.[42]\r\n\r\nThe following conclusions are deduced from the observations made on\r\nVenus.\r\n\r\n1. That this planet may be seen distinctly, with a moderate degree of\r\nmagnifying power, _at the moment of its superior conjunction with the\r\nsun_, when its geocentric latitude, either north or south, at the\r\ntime of conjunction, is not less than 1° 14´, or, when the planet is\r\nabout 58´ from the sun’s limb. This conclusion is deduced from the\r\nobservation of Oct. 2, 1843,[45] stated above.\r\n\r\n2. Another conclusion is--that during the space of 583 days, or about\r\n19 months--the time this planet takes in moving from one conjunction\r\nwith the sun to a like conjunction again--when its latitude at the\r\ntime of its superior conjunction exceeds 1° 14´, it may be seen\r\nwith an equatorial telescope every clear day without interruption,\r\nexcept about the period of its _inferior_ conjunction, when its dark\r\nhemisphere is turned towards the earth, and a short time before and\r\nafter it. When its geocentric latitude is less than 1° 14´, it will be\r\nhid only about four days before, and the same time after its superior\r\nconjunction. During the same period it will be invisible to the naked\r\neye, and consequently no observations can be made upon it with a common\r\ntelescope, for nearly six months, and sometimes more, according as its\r\ndeclination is north or south, namely about two or three months before,\r\nand the same time after its superior conjunction, except where there\r\nis a very free and unconfined horizon. In regard to the time in which\r\nthis planet can be hid about the period of its _inferior_ conjunction,\r\nI have ascertained from observation, that it can never be hid longer\r\nthan during a space of 2 days 22 hours; having seen Venus, about noon,\r\nlike a fine slender crescent, only 35 hours after she had passed the\r\npoint of her inferior conjunction; and in a late instance she was seen\r\nwhen little more than a day from the period of conjunction. The longest\r\ntime, therefore, that this planet can be hid from view during a period\r\nof 583 days, is only about 10 days; and when its latitude at the time\r\nof the superior conjunction, equals or exceeds 1° 14´, it can be hid\r\nlittle more than two days. This is a circumstance which cannot be\r\naffirmed of any other celestial body, the sun only excepted.\r\n\r\n3. That every variation of the phases of this planet--from a slender\r\ncrescent to a full enlightened hemisphere--may, on every clear day,\r\nbe conveniently exhibited by means of the equatorial telescope.\r\nThis circumstance renders this instrument peculiarly useful in the\r\ninstruction of the young in the principles of astronomy. For, if the\r\nphase which Venus should exhibit at any particular time be known, the\r\nequatorial telescope may be directed to the planet, and its actual\r\nphase in the heavens be immediately exhibited to the astronomical pupil.\r\n\r\n4. Since it is only at the period of the superior conjunction that\r\nthis planet presents a full enlightened hemisphere, and since it is\r\nonly when this phase is presented that both its diameters can be\r\nmeasured--it is of some importance that observations be made on it at\r\nthe moment of conjunction, by means of powerful telescopes furnished\r\nwith micrometers, so as to determine the difference (if any) between\r\nits polar and equatorial diameters.\r\n\r\n5. Another conclusion from the observations on Venus, is, that a\r\nmoderate diminution of the aperture of the object-glass of the\r\ntelescope is useful, and even necessary in viewing this planet when\r\nnear the sun. Its effect is owing in part to the direct solar rays\r\nbeing thereby more effectually excluded; for when these rays enter\r\ndirectly into the tube of the telescope, it is very difficult, and\r\nalmost impossible to perceive this planet, or any other celestial body\r\nwhen in the vicinity of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Observations on Jupiter and other planets._\r\n\r\nThis planet is very easily distinguished in the day-time with a very\r\nmoderate magnifying power, when it is not within 30° or 35° of the sun.\r\nThe following extract from my memorandums may serve as a specimen. May\r\n12, 1813, 1^h 40^m, P.M. Saw Jupiter with a power of 15 times,\r\nthe aperture not contracted. The planet appeared so distinct with this\r\npower, that I have reason to believe, it would have been perceived with\r\na power of 6 or 7 times. When the aperture was contracted 9/10 inch,\r\nand afterwards to half an inch, there was little perceptible difference\r\nin its appearance. It was then about 58° in longitude, east of the sun.\r\n\r\nThough Jupiter when at a considerable distance from the sun, and near\r\nhis opposition, appears to the naked eye with a brilliancy nearly equal\r\nto that of Venus, yet there is a very striking difference between them,\r\nin respect of lustre, when viewed in day-light. Jupiter, when viewed\r\nwith a high magnifying power, in the day-time, always exhibits a very\r\ndull cloudy appearance; whereas Venus appears with a moderate degree of\r\nsplendour. About the end of June 1813, between 5 and 6 in the evening,\r\nhaving viewed the planet Venus, then within 20° of the sun, and which\r\nappeared with a moderate degree of lustre, I directed the telescope to\r\nJupiter, at that time more than 32° from the sun, when the contrast\r\nbetween the two planets was very striking, Jupiter appearing so faint\r\nas to be just discernible, though his apparent magnitude was nearly\r\ndouble that of Venus. In this observation a power of 65 was used.\r\nIn his approach towards the sun, about the end of July, I could not\r\nperceive him when he was within 16° or 17° of his conjunction with that\r\nluminary.--_These circumstances furnish a sensible and popular proof_,\r\nindependently of astronomical calculations, _that the planet Jupiter\r\nis placed at a much greater distance from the sun than Venus_; since\r\nits light is so faint as to be scarcely perceptible when more than 20\r\ndegrees from the sun, while that of Venus is distinctly seen amidst\r\nthe full splendour of the solar rays, when only about a degree from\r\nthe margin of that luminary. With a power of 65 I have been enabled\r\nto distinguish the _belts_ of Jupiter before sun-set, but could never\r\nperceive any of his satellites till the sun was below the horizon.\r\nThere are no observations which so sensibly and strikingly indicate\r\nthe different degrees of light emitted by the different planets as\r\nthose which are made in the day-time. To a common observer, during\r\nnight, Jupiter and Venus appear, in a clear sky, nearly with equal\r\nbrilliancy, and even Mars, when about the point of his _opposition_ to\r\nthe sun, appears with a lustre somewhat similar, though tinged with a\r\nruddy hue; but when seen in day-light their aspect is very dissimilar.\r\nThis circumstance evidently indicates, 1. that these planets are\r\nplaced at different distances from the sun, and consequently are\r\nfurnished with different degrees of light proportional to the square\r\nof their distances from that luminary;--and 2. that there are certain\r\ncircumstances connected with the surfaces and atmospheres of the\r\nplanetary bodies, which render the light they emit more or less\r\nintense, independently of their different distances from the central\r\nluminary. For Mars, though much nearer to the sun than Jupiter, is not\r\nso easily distinguished in the day-time, and, even in the night-time,\r\nappears with a less degree of lustre.\r\n\r\nMy observations on _Saturn_ in day-light, have not been so frequent as\r\nthose on Jupiter. I have been enabled to distinguish his ring several\r\ntimes before sun-set, with a power of 65; but his great southern\r\ndeclination, and consequent low altitude, at the periods when these\r\nobservations were made, were unfavourable for determining the degree\r\nof his visibility in day-light; for a planet or a star is always more\r\ndistinctly perceptible in a _high_ than in a low altitude, on account\r\nof the superior purity of the atmosphere through which a celestial\r\nobject is seen when at a high elevation above the horizon. This planet,\r\nhowever, is not nearly so distinctly visible in day-light as Jupiter,\r\nand I have chiefly seen it, when the sun was not more than an hour or\r\ntwo above the horizon, but never at noon-day; although it is probable\r\nthat with powerful instruments it may be seen even at that period\r\nof the day. The planet _Mars_ is seldom distinctly visible in the\r\nday-time, except when at no great distance from its opposition to the\r\nsun. The following is a memorandum of an observation on Mars, when in a\r\nfavourable position. October 24, 1836. Saw the planet Mars distinctly\r\nwith a power of about 60, at 40 minutes past 9 A.M., the\r\nsun having been above the horizon nearly three hours. It appeared\r\ntolerably distinct, but scarcely so brilliant as a fixed star of the\r\nfirst magnitude, but with apparently as much light as Jupiter generally\r\nexhibits when viewed in day-light. It could not be traced longer at the\r\ntime, so as to ascertain if it could be seen at mid-day; on account\r\nof the interposition of the western side of the window of the place\r\nof observation. The ruddy aspect of this planet--doubtless caused by\r\na dense atmosphere with which it is environed--is one of the causes\r\nwhich prevents its appearing with brilliancy in the day-time. With\r\nrespect to the planet _Mercury_, I have had opportunities of observing\r\nit several times after sun-rise, and before sun-set, about 10 or 12\r\ndays before and after its greatest elongation from the sun, with a\r\npower of 45. I have several times searched for this planet about noon,\r\nbut could not perceive it. The air, however, at the times alluded to,\r\nwas not very clear, and I was not certain that it was within the field\r\nof the telescope; and therefore, I am not convinced but that, with a\r\nmoderately high power, it may be seen even at noon-day.\r\n\r\nSuch are some specimens of the observations I have made on the heavenly\r\nbodies in the day-time, and the conclusions which may be deduced from\r\nthem. I have been induced to communicate them, from the consideration,\r\nthat the most minute facts, in relation to any science, are worthy of\r\nbeing known, and may possibly be useful. They may at least gratify the\r\nastronomical tyro with some information which he will not find in the\r\ncommon treatises on astronomy, and may perhaps excite him to prosecute\r\na train of similar observations for confirming or correcting those\r\nwhich have been noted above.\r\n\r\nBesides the deductions already stated, the following general\r\nconclusions may be noted.--1. That a celestial body may be as easily\r\ndistinguished at noon-day, as at any time between the hours of nine in\r\nthe morning and three in the afternoon, except during the short days\r\nin winter. 2. They are more easily distinguished at a high than at\r\na low altitude--in the afternoon than in the morning, especially if\r\ntheir altitudes be low--and in the northern region of the heavens than\r\nin the southern. The difficulty of perceiving them at a low altitude\r\nis obviously owing to the thick vapours near the horizon. Their being\r\nless easily distinguished in the morning than in the afternoon is owing\r\nto the undulations of the atmosphere, which are generally greater in\r\nthe morning than in the afternoon. This may be evidently perceived\r\nby looking at distant land-objects at those times, in a hot day,\r\nthrough a telescope which magnifies about 40 or 50 times, when they\r\nwill be found to appear tremulous and distorted in consequence of these\r\nundulations, especially if the sun be shining bright. In consequence\r\nof this circumstance, we can seldom use a high terrestrial power with\r\neffect on land objects, except early in the morning, and a short\r\ntime before sun-set. Their being more easily distinguished in the\r\nnorthern region of the heavens is owing to that part of the sky being\r\nof a deeper azure, on account of its being less enlightened than the\r\nsouthern with the splendour of the solar rays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Utility of Celestial Day Observations._\r\n\r\nThe observations on the heavenly bodies in the day-time, to which I\r\nhave now directed the attention of the reader, are not to be considered\r\nas merely gratifications of a rational curiosity, but may be rendered\r\nsubservient to the promotion of astronomical science. As to the planet\r\nVenus--when I consider the degree of brilliancy it exhibits, even in\r\nday-light, I am convinced that useful observations might frequently\r\nbe made on its surface in the day-time, to determine some of its\r\nphysical peculiarities and phenomena. Such observations might set\r\nat rest any disputes which may still exist respecting the period of\r\nrotation of this planet. Cassini, from observations on a bright spot,\r\nwhich advanced 20° in 24^h 34^m determined the time of its rotation to\r\nbe 23 hours, 20 minutes. On the other hand, Bianchini, from similar\r\nobservations, concluded that its diurnal period was 24 days and 8\r\nhours. The difficulty of deciding between these two opinions, arises\r\nfrom the short time in which observations can be made on this planet,\r\neither before sun-rise, or after sun-set, which prevents us from\r\ntracing, with accuracy, the progressive motion of its spots for a\r\nsufficient length of time. And, although an observer should mark the\r\nmotion of the spots at the same hour, on two succeeding evenings, and\r\nfind they had moved forward about 15° in 24 hours, he would still be\r\nat a loss to determine, whether they had moved only 15°, in all, since\r\nthe preceding observation, or had finished a revolution and 15° more.\r\nIf, therefore, any spots could be perceived on the surface of Venus\r\nin the day-time, their motion might be traced, when she is in north\r\ndeclination, for 12 hours or more, which would completely settle the\r\nperiod of rotation. That it is not improbable that spots, fitted for\r\nthis purpose, may be discovered on her disk in the day-time, appears\r\nfrom some of the observations of Cassini, who saw one of her spots when\r\nthe sun was more than eight degrees above the horizon.[46] The most\r\ndistinct and satisfactory views I have ever had of this planet were\r\nthose which I obtained in the day-time, in summer, when it was viewed\r\nat a high altitude, with a 44-1/2 inch achromatic telescope, carrying a\r\npower of 150. I have at such times distinctly perceived the distinction\r\nbetween the shade and colour of its margin, and the superior lustre of\r\nits central parts, and some spots have occasionally been seen, though\r\nnot so distinctly marked as to determine its rotation. Such distinct\r\nviews are seldom to be obtained in the evening after sun-set, on\r\naccount of the undulations of the atmosphere, and the dense mass of\r\nvapours through which the celestial bodies are viewed when near the\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\nNor do I consider it altogether improbable that its _satellite_ (if\r\nit have one, as some have supposed) may be detected in the day time,\r\nwhen this planet is in a favourable position for such an observation;\r\nparticularly when a pretty large portion of its enlightened surface\r\nis turned towards the earth, and when its satellite, of course, must\r\npresent a similar phase. About the period of its greatest elongation\r\nfrom the sun, and soon after it assumes a crescent phase, in its\r\napproach to the inferior conjunction, may be considered as the most\r\neligible times for prosecuting such observations. If this supposed\r\nsatellite be about one third or one fourth of the diameter of its\r\nPrimary, as Cassini, Short, Baudouin, Montbarron, Montaigne, and other\r\nastronomers supposed, it must be nearly as large as Mercury, which has\r\nbeen frequently seen in day-light. If such a satellite have a real\r\nexistence, and yet undistinguishable in day-light, its surface must be\r\nof a very different quality for reflecting the rays of light from that\r\nof its primary; for it is obvious to every one who has seen Venus with\r\na high power, in the day-time, that a body of equal brilliancy--though\r\nfour times less in diameter--would be quite perceptible, and exhibit a\r\nvisible disk. Such observations, however, would be made, with a much\r\ngreater effect in Italy and other Southern countries, and particularly\r\nin Tropical climates, such as the southern parts of Asia and America,\r\nand in the West India Islands, where the sky is more clear and serene,\r\nand where the planet may be viewed at higher altitudes, and for a\r\ngreater length of time, without the interruption of clouds, than in our\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nAgain, the apparent magnitudes of the fixed stars--the quantity of\r\nlight they respectively emit--and the precise class of magnitude which\r\nshould be assigned to them--might be more accurately determined by\r\nday observations, than by their appearance in the nocturnal sky. All\r\nthe stars which are reckoned to belong to the _first magnitude_ are\r\nnot equally distinguishable in day-light. For example, the stars\r\n_Aldebaran_ and _Procyon_ are not so easily distinguished, nor do they\r\nappear with the same degree of lustre by day, as the stars α _Lyræ_\r\nand _Capella_. In like manner the stars _Altair_, _Alphard_, _Deneb\r\nRas Alkague_, considered as belonging to the _second_ magnitude,\r\nare not equally distinguishable by the same aperture and magnifying\r\npower--which seems to indicate, that a different quantity of light\r\nis emitted by these stars, arising from a difference either in their\r\nmagnitude, their distance, or the quality of the light with which they\r\nare irradiated.\r\n\r\nThe following are likewise practical purposes to which celestial day\r\nobservations may be applied. In accurately adjusting Circular and\r\nTransit instruments, it is useful, and even necessary, for determining\r\nthe exact position of the meridian, to take observations of certain\r\nstars, which differ greatly in zenith distance, and which transit the\r\nmeridian nearly at the same time. But as the stars best situated for\r\nthis purpose, cannot, at every season, be seen in the evenings, we\r\nmust, in certain cases, wait for several months till such observations\r\ncan be made, unless we make them in the day-time, which can very easily\r\nbe done, if the instrument have a telescope adapted to it, furnished\r\nwith such powers as those above stated, or higher powers if required. I\r\nhave likewise made use of observations on the stars in the day time for\r\nadjusting a clock or watch to meantime, when the sun was in a situation\r\nbeyond the range of the instrument, or obscured by clouds, and when\r\nI did not choose to wait till the evening. This may, at first view,\r\nappear to some as paradoxical; since the finding of a star in day-light\r\ndepends on our knowing its right Ascension from the sun, and this last\r\ncircumstance depends, in some measure, on our knowing the true time.\r\nBut if a watch or clock is known not to have varied above seven or\r\neight minutes from the time, a star of the first magnitude may easily\r\nbe found, by moving the telescope a little backwards or forwards, till\r\nthe star appear; and when it is once found, the exact variation of the\r\nmovement is then ascertained, by comparing the calculations which were\r\npreviously necessary, with the time pointed out by the nonius on the\r\nEquatorial circle--or, in other words, by ascertaining the difference\r\nbetween the time assumed, and the time indicated by the instrument,\r\nwhen the star appears in the centre of the field of view. All this may\r\nbe accomplished in five or six minutes.\r\n\r\nBesides the practical purposes now stated, the Equatorial telescope is\r\nperhaps the best instrument for instructing a learner in the various\r\noperations of practical astronomy, and particularly for enabling him\r\nto distinguish the names and positions of the principal stars. For,\r\nwhen the right Ascension and Declination of any star is known, from\r\nastronomical tables, the telescope may be immediately adjusted to\r\npoint to it, which will infallibly prevent his mistaking one star for\r\nanother. In this way, likewise, the precise position of the planet\r\n_Mercury_, _Uranus_, _Vesta_, _Juno_, _Ceres_, _Pallas_--a small\r\ncomet, a nebula, a double star, or any other celestial body not easily\r\ndistinguishable by the naked eye, may be readily pointed out, when its\r\nright Ascension and Declination are known to a near approximation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I cannot but express my surprise, that the Equatorial\r\ntelescope is so little known, even by many of the lovers of\r\nastronomical science. In several respectable academies in this part of\r\nBritain, and, if I am not misinformed, in most of our universities,\r\nthis instrument is entirely unknown. This is the more unaccountable,\r\nas a small equatorial may be purchased for a moderate sum; and as\r\nthere is no single instrument so well adapted for illustrating all the\r\noperations of Practical Astronomy. Where very great accuracy is not\r\nrequired, it may occasionally be made to serve the general purposes\r\nof a _transit instrument_ for observing the passages of the sun and\r\nstars across the meridian. It may likewise be made to serve as a\r\n_theodolite_ for surveying land and taking horizontal angles--as a\r\n_Quadrant_ for taking angles of altitude--as a _level_--as an _equal\r\naltitude instrument_--an _azimuth instrument_ for ascertaining the\r\nsun’s distance from the north or south points of the horizon--and\r\nas an accurate Universal Sun Dial, for finding the exact _mean_ or\r\n_true_ time, on any occasion when the sun is visible. The manner of\r\napplying it to these different purposes will be obvious to every one\r\nwho is in the least acquainted with the nature and construction of this\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThe price of a small Equatorial instrument, such as that described\r\np. 454, is about 16 guineas, exclusive of some of the eye-pieces,\r\nwhich were afterwards added for the purpose of making particular\r\nobservations. Instruments of a larger size, and with more complicated\r\nmachinery, sell from 50 to 100 guineas and upwards. Messrs. W. and S.\r\nJones, Holborn, London, construct such instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE QUADRANT.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 87._]\r\n\r\nEvery circle being supposed to be divided into 360 equal parts, or\r\ndegrees,--it is evident, that 90 degrees, or the fourth part of a\r\ncircle, will be sufficient to measure all angles, between the horizon\r\nof any place and the line perpendicular to it which goes up to the\r\nzenith. Thus, in fig. 87, the line CB represents the plane of the\r\nhorizon. ACBH, the quadrant, AC the perpendicular to the horizon,\r\nand A the zenith point. If the lines BC and CA represent a pair of\r\ncompasses with the legs standing perpendicular to each other, and\r\nthe curved lines AB, DE and FG, the quarter of as many circles of\r\ndifferent sizes--it is evident that although each of these differs\r\nfrom the others in size, yet that each contains the same portion of a\r\ncircle, namely a quadrant or fourth part; and thus it would be from the\r\nsmallest to the largest quadrant that could be formed,--they would all\r\ncontain exactly 90 degrees each. By the application of this principle\r\nthe comparative measure of angles may be extended to an indefinite\r\ndistance. By means of an instrument constructed in the form of a\r\nquadrant of a circle, with its curved edge divided into 90 equal parts,\r\nthe altitude of any object in the heavens can at any time be determined.\r\n\r\nThere are various constructions of this instrument, some of them\r\nextremely simple, and others considerably complex and expensive,\r\naccording to the degree of accuracy which the observations require. The\r\nfollowing is a description of the _Pillar Quadrant_, as it was made by\r\nMr. Bird, for the observatory of Greenwich, and several continental\r\nobservatories.\r\n\r\nThis instrument consists of a quadrant E E H G L (fig. 88.) mounted on\r\na pillar B, which is supported by a tripod AA, resting on three foot\r\nscrews. The quadrant, the pillar, and the horizontal circle all revolve\r\nround a vertical axis. A telescope H is placed on the horizontal\r\nradius, and is directed to a meridian mark previously made on some\r\ndistant object for placing the plane of the instrument in the meridian,\r\nand also for setting the zero, or beginning of the scale truly\r\nhorizontal. This is sometimes done by a level instead of a telescope,\r\nand sometimes by a plumb-line G, suspended from near the centre, and\r\nbrought to bisect a fine dot made on the limb, where a microscope is\r\nplaced to examine the bisection. The weight or plummet at the end of\r\nthe plumb-line is suspended in the cistern of water _b_, which keeps it\r\nfrom being agitated by the air. A similar dot is made for the upper end\r\nof the plumb-line upon a piece of brass, adjustable by a screw _d_, in\r\norder that the line may be exactly at right angles to the telescope,\r\nwhen it is placed at O. The quadrant is screwed by the centre\r\nof its frame, against a piece of brass _e_ with three screws, and this\r\npiece is screwed to the top of the pillar B with other three screws.\r\nBy means of the first three screws, the plane of the quadrant can be\r\nplaced exactly parallel to the vertical axis, and by the other screws\r\nthe telescope H can be placed exactly perpendicular to it. The nut of\r\nthe delicate screw L is attached to the end of the telescope F, by a\r\nuniversal joint. The collar for the other end is jointed in the same\r\nmanner to a clamp which can be fastened to any part of the limb.\r\nA similar clamp-screw and slow motion is seen at _n_ for the lower\r\ncircle, which is intended to hold the circle fast, and adjust its\r\nmotion. The divisions of the lower, or horizontal circle, are read by\r\nverniers, or noniuses, fixed to the arms of the tripod at _l_ and _m_,\r\nand, in some cases three are used to obtain greater accuracy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 88._]\r\n\r\nIn using this quadrant, the axis of the telescope H is adjusted to a\r\nhorizontal line, and the plane of the quadrant to a vertical line, by\r\nthe means already stated. The screw of the champ L is then loosened,\r\nand the telescope directed to the star, or other object, whose altitude\r\nis required. The clamp screw being fixed, the observer looks through\r\nthe telescope, and with the nut of the screw L he brings the telescope\r\ninto a position where the star is bisected by the intersection of the\r\nwires in the field of the telescope. The divisions are then to be read\r\noff upon the vernier, and the altitude of the star will be obtained.\r\nBy means of the horizontal circle D, all angles in the plane of the\r\nhorizon may be accurately measured--such as the amplitudes and azimuths\r\nof the celestial bodies.\r\n\r\nQuadrants of a more simple construction than the above, may be\r\noccasionally used, such as Gunter’s, Cole’s, Sutton’s and others; but\r\nnone of these are furnished with telescopes, or telescopic sights, and\r\ntherefore an altitude cannot be obtained by them with the same degree\r\nof accuracy as with that which has been now described.\r\n\r\nBy means of the Quadrant, not only the altitudes of the heavenly bodies\r\nmay be determined, but also the distances of objects on the earth by\r\nobservations made at two stations--the altitude of fireballs and other\r\nmeteors in the atmosphere--the height of a cloud, by observation on\r\nits altitude and velocity--and numerous other problems, the solution of\r\nwhich depends upon angular measurements. A _Mural Quadrant_ is the name\r\ngiven to this instrument when it is fixed upon a wall of stone, and in\r\nthe plane of the meridian, such as the quadrant which was erected by\r\nFlamstead in the Observatory at Greenwich. Although the quadrant was\r\nformerly much used in astronomical observations, yet it may be proper\r\nto state, that its use has now been almost completely superseded by\r\nthe recent introduction of _Astronomical Circles_, of which we shall\r\nnow give the reader a very short description, chiefly taken from\r\nTroughton’s account of the instrument he constructed, as found in Sir\r\nD. Brewster’s Supplement to Ferguson’s Astronomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASTRONOMICAL CIRCLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 89._]\r\n\r\nAn astronomical circle is a _complete circle_ substituted in place\r\nof the quadrant, and differs from it only in the superior accuracy\r\nwith which it enables the astronomer to make his observations. The\r\nlarge vertical or declination circle CC (fig. 89.) is composed of two\r\ncomplete circles strengthened by an edge bar on their inside, and\r\nfirmly united at their extreme borders by a number of short braces or\r\nbars which stand perpendicular between them, and which keep them at\r\nsuch a distance as to admit the achromatic telescope TT. This double\r\ncircle is supported by 16 conical bars, firmly united along with the\r\ntelescope, to a horizontal axis. The exterior limb of each circle is\r\ndivided into degrees and parts of a degree, and these divisions are\r\ndivided into seconds by means of the micrometer microscopes _mm_,\r\nwhich read off the angle on opposite sides of each circle. The cross\r\nwires in each microscope may be moved over the limb till they coincide\r\nwith the nearest division of the limb, by means of the micrometer\r\nscrews _cc_, and the space moved through is ascertained by the\r\ndivisions on the graduated head above _c_, assisted by a scale within\r\nthe microscope. The microscopes are supported by two arms proceeding\r\nfrom a small circle concentric with the horizontal axis, and fixed\r\nto the vertical columns. This circle is the centre upon which they\r\ncan turn round nearly a quadrant for the purpose of employing a new\r\nportion of the divisions of the circle, when it is reckoned prudent to\r\nrepeat any delicate observations upon any part of the limb. At _h_ is\r\nrepresented a level for placing the axis in a true horizontal line, and\r\nat _k_ is fixed another level parallel to the telescope, for bringing\r\nthe zero of the divisions to a horizontal position. The horizontal axis\r\nto which the vertical circle and the telescope are fixed, is equal in\r\nlength to the distance between the vertical pillars, and its pivots are\r\nsupported by semicircular bearings, placed at the top of each pillar.\r\nThese two vertical pillars are firmly united at their bases to a cross\r\nbar _f_. To this cross bar is also fixed a vertical axis about three\r\nfeet long, the lower end of which terminating in an obtuse point, rests\r\nin a brass conical socket firmly fastened at the bottom of the hollow\r\nin the stone pedestal D, which receives the vertical axis. This socket\r\nsupports the whole weight of the moveable part of the instrument. The\r\nupper part of the vertical axis is supported by two pieces of brass,\r\none of which is seen at _e_, screwed to the ring _i_, and containing\r\na right angle, or Y. At each side of the ring, opposite to the points\r\nof contact, is placed a tube containing a heliacal spring, which, by\r\na constant pressure on the axis, keeps it against its bearings, and\r\npermits it to turn, in these four points of contact, with an easy and\r\nsteady motion. The two bearings are fixed upon two rings capable of\r\na lateral adjustment; the lower one by the screw _d_ to incline the\r\naxis to the east or west, while the screw _b_ gives the upper one _i_\r\na motion in the plane of the meridian. By this means the axis may be\r\nadjusted to a perpendicular position as exactly as by the usual method\r\nof the tripod with feet screws. These rings are attached to the centre\r\npiece _s_, which is firmly connected with the upper surface of the\r\nstone by six conical Tubes A, A, A, &c., and brass standards at every\r\nangle of the pedestal. Below this frame lies the azimuth circle EE\r\nconsisting of a circular limb, strengthened by ten hollow cones firmly\r\nunited with the vertical axis, and consequently turning freely along\r\nwith it. The azimuth circle EE is divided and read off in the same\r\nmanner as the vertical circle. The arms of the microscopes BB project\r\nfrom the ring _i_, and the microscopes themselves are adjustable by\r\nscrews, to bring them to zero and to the diameter of the circle. A\r\nlittle above the ring _i_ is fixed an arm L which embraces and holds\r\nfast the vertical axis with the aid of a champ screw. The arm L is\r\nconnected at the extremity with one of the arms A, by means of the\r\nscrew _a_, so that by turning this screw, a slow motion is communicated\r\nto the vertical axis and the azimuth circle.\r\n\r\nIn order to place the instrument in a true vertical position, a\r\nplumb-line, made of fine silver wire, is suspended from a small hook\r\nat the top of the vertical tube _n_, connected by braces with one of\r\nthe large pillars. The plumb-line passes through an angle in which it\r\nrests, and by means of a screw may be brought into the axis of the\r\ntube. The plummet at the lower end of the line is immersed in a cistern\r\nof water _t_, in order to check its oscillations, and is supported on\r\na shelf proceeding from one of the pillars. At the lower end of the\r\ntube _n_ are fixed two microscopes _o_ and _p_, at right angles to\r\none another, and opposite to each is placed a small tube containing a\r\nlucid point. The plumb-line is then brought into such a position by\r\nthe screws _d_, _b_, and by altering the suspension of the plumb-line\r\nitself, that the image of the luminous point, like the disk of a\r\nplanet, is formed on the plumb-line, and accurately bisected by it. The\r\nvertical axis is then turned round, and the plumb-line examined in some\r\nother position. If it still bisects the luminous point, the instrument\r\nis truly vertical; but if it does not, one half of the deviation must\r\nbe corrected by the screws _d_ _b_, and the other half by altering the\r\nsuspension of the line till the bisection of the circular image is\r\nperfect in every position of the instrument.\r\n\r\nIt is not many years since Circular Repeating instruments came into\r\ngeneral use. The principle on which the construction of a repeating\r\ncircle is founded appears to have been first suggested by Professor\r\nMayer of Gottingen, in 1758; but the first person who applied this\r\nprinciple to measure round the limb of a divided instrument, was Borda,\r\nwho about the year 1789, caused a repeating circle to be constructed\r\nthat would measure with equal facility horizontal and vertical angles.\r\nAfterwards, Mr. Troughton greatly improved the construction of Borda’s\r\ninstrument by the introduction of several contrivances which ensure,\r\nat the same time, its superior accuracy and convenience in use; and\r\nhis instruments have been introduced into numerous observatories.\r\nCircular instruments, on a large scale, have been placed in the Royal\r\nObservatory of Greenwich, and in most of the principal observatories\r\non the continent of Europe. Although it is agreed on all hands that\r\ngreater accuracy may be obtained by a repeating circle, than by any\r\nother having the same radius, yet there are some objections to its use\r\nwhich do not apply to the altitude and azimuth circle. The following\r\nare the principal objections, as stated in Vol. I., of the ‘Memoirs of\r\nthe Astronomical Society of London.’ 1. The origin of the repeating\r\ncircle is due to _bad dividing_, which ought not to be tolerated in any\r\ninstrument in the present state of the art. 2. There are three sources\r\nof fixed error which cannot be exterminated, as they depend more on the\r\nmaterials than on the workmanship; first, the zero of the level changes\r\nwith variations of temperature; secondly, the resistance of the centre\r\nwork to the action of the tangent screws; and thirdly, the imperfection\r\nof the screws in producing motion, and in securing permanent positions.\r\n3. The instrument is applied with most advantage to slowly moving or\r\ncircumpolar stars; but in low altitudes these stars are seen near the\r\nhorizon, where refraction interferes. 4. Much time and labour are\r\nexpended, first in making the observations, and again in reducing them.\r\n5. When any one step in a series of observations is bad, the whole time\r\nand labour are absolutely lost. 6. When the instrument has a telescope\r\nof small power, the observations are charged with errors of vision,\r\nwhich the repeating circle will not cure. 7. This instrument cannot be\r\nused as a transit instrument, nor for finding the exact meridian of a\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA great variety of directions is necessary in order to enable the\r\nstudent of practical astronomy thoroughly to understand and to apply\r\nthis instrument to practice, which the limited nature of the present\r\nwork prevents us from detailing.--As this instrument consists of a\r\nvariety of complicated pieces of machinery, it is necessarily somewhat\r\nexpensive. A six inch brass astronomical circle for altitudes, zenith\r\nor polar distances, azimuths, with achromatic telescope, &c., is marked\r\nin Messrs. W. and S. Jones’ catalogue of astronomical instruments, at\r\n£27 6s. A circle 12 inches diameter, from £36 15s. to £68 5s. An 18\r\ninch ditto, of the best construction, £105. The larger astronomical\r\ncircles for public observatories, from 100 to a 1000 guineas and\r\nupwards, according to their size, and the peculiarity of their\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSIT INSTRUMENT.\r\n\r\nA Transit instrument is intended for observing celestial objects as\r\nthey pass across the meridian. It consists of a telescope fixed at\r\nright angles to a horizontal axis--which axis must be so supported that\r\nwhat is called _the line of collimation_, or the line of sight of the\r\ntelescope, may move in the plane of the meridian. This instrument was\r\nfirst invented by Romer in the year 1689, but has since received great\r\nimprovements by Troughton, Jones and other modern artists. Transit\r\ninstruments may be divided into two classes, _Portable_, and _Fixed_.\r\nThe portable instrument, when placed truly in the meridian, and well\r\nadjusted, may be advantageously used as a stationary instrument in an\r\nobservatory, if its dimensions be such as to admit of a telescope of\r\n3-1/2 feet focal length; but when the main tube is only from 20 to\r\n30 inches long, with a proportional aperture, it is more suited for\r\na travelling instrument to give the exact time; and, when carried on\r\nboard a ship in a voyage of discovery, may be taken on shore at any\r\nconvenient place, for determining the solar time of that place, and for\r\ncorrecting the daily rate of the Chronometer giving the time at the\r\nfirst meridian, so that the longitude of the place of observation may\r\nbe obtained from the difference of the observed and indicated times,\r\nafter the proper corrections have been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 90._]\r\n\r\nThe following is a brief description of one of Mr. Troughton’s Portable\r\nTransit Instruments. In fig. 90. PP is an achromatic telescope firmly\r\nfixed, by the middle to a double conical and horizontal axis HH, the\r\npivots of which rest on angular bearings called Ys, at the top of\r\nthe standards B, B, rendered steady by oblique braces DD, fastened\r\nto the central part of the circle, AA. In large fixed instruments,\r\nthe pivots and angular bearings are supported on two massive stone\r\npillars, sunk several feet into the ground, and are sometimes supported\r\nby mason-work, to secure perfect stability. The axis HH has two\r\nadjustments, one for making it exactly level, and the other for placing\r\nthe telescope in the meridian. A graduated circle L is fixed to the\r\nextremity of the pivot which extends beyond one of the Ys, and the two\r\nradii that carry the verniers _aa_, are fitted to the extremities of\r\nthe pivot in such a way as to turn round independent of the axis. The\r\ndouble verniers have a small level attached to them, and a third arm\r\n_b_, which is connected with the standard B by means of a screw _s_.\r\nIf the verniers are placed by means of the level, in a true horizontal\r\nposition, when the axis of the telescope is horizontal, and the arm _b_\r\nscrewed by the screw _s_ to the standard B, the verniers will always\r\nread off the inclination of the telescope, and will enable the observer\r\nto point it to any star, by means of its meridian altitude. The whole\r\ninstrument rests on three foot screws entered into the circle AA. In\r\nthe field of view of the telescope, there are several parallel vertical\r\nwires, crossed at right angles with a horizontal one, and the telescope\r\nis sometimes furnished with a diagonal eye-piece, for observing stars\r\nnear the zenith. A level likewise generally accompanies the instrument,\r\nin order to place it horizontal, by being applied to the pivots of the\r\naxis.\r\n\r\nIn order to fix the transit instrument exactly in the meridian, a good\r\nclock regulated to sidereal time is necessary. This regulation may be\r\neffected by taking equal altitudes of the sun or a star before and\r\nafter they pass the meridian, which may be done by small quadrants,\r\nor by a good sextant. The axis H of the instrument is then to be\r\nplaced horizontal by a spirit level, which accompanies the transit,\r\nand the greatest care must be taken that the axis of vision describes\r\nin the heavens a great circle of the sphere. To ascertain whether the\r\ntelescope be in the plane of the meridian, observe by the clock when\r\na circumpolar star seen through the telescope transits both above and\r\nbelow the pole; and if the times of describing the eastern and western\r\nparts of its circuit be equal, the telescope is then in the plane of\r\nthe meridian; otherwise, certain adjustments must be made. When the\r\ntelescope is at length perfectly adjusted, a land-mark must be fixed\r\nupon, at a considerable distance--the greater the better. This mark\r\nmust be in the horizontal direction of the intersection of the cross\r\nwires, and in a place where it can be illuminated, if possible, in the\r\nnight time, by a lantern hanging near it; which mark being on a fixed\r\nobject, will serve at all times afterwards for examining the position\r\nof the telescope.\r\n\r\nVarious observations and adjustments are requisite in order to fixing a\r\ntransit instrument exactly in the plane of the meridian. There is the\r\nadjustment of the _level_--the horizontal adjustment of the axis of\r\nthe telescope--the placing of the parallel lines in the focus of the\r\neye-glass, so as to be truly vertical, and to determine the equatorial\r\nvalue of their intervals--the collimation in _azimuth_, so that a\r\nline passing from the middle vertical line to the optical centre of\r\nthe object-glass, is at right angles with the axis of the telescope’s\r\nmotion--the collimation in _altitude_, so that the horizontal line\r\nshould cross the parallel vertical lines, not only at right angles, but\r\nalso in the optical centre of the field of view--with various other\r\nparticulars; but of which our limited space will not permit us to enter\r\ninto details. Those who wish to enter into all the minute details in\r\nreference to the construction and practical application of this and the\r\nother instruments above described, as well as all the other instruments\r\nused by the Practical Astronomer, will find ample satisfaction in\r\nperusing the Rev. Dr. Pearson’s Introduction to Practical Astronomy,\r\n4to., Vol. II.\r\n\r\nA portable Transit instrument, with a cast-iron stand, the axis 12\r\ninches in length, and the achromatic telescope about 20 inches, packed\r\nin a case, sells at about 16 guineas: with a brass-framed stand and\r\nother additions, at about 20 guineas. Transit instruments of larger\r\ndimensions are higher in proportion to their size, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nON OBSERVATORIES.\r\n\r\nIn order to make observations, with convenience and effect, on the\r\nheavenly bodies, it is expedient that an _observatory_, or place for\r\nmaking the requisite observations, be erected in a proper situation.\r\nThe following are some of the leading features of a spot adapted for\r\nmaking celestial observations: 1. It should command an extensive\r\nvisible horizon all around, particularly towards the south and the\r\nnorth. 2. It should be a little elevated above surrounding objects.\r\n3. It should be, if possible, at a considerable distance from\r\nmanufactories, and other objects which emit much smoke or vapour,\r\nand even from chimney-tops where no sensible smoke is emitted, as\r\nthe heated air from the top of funnels causes undulations in the\r\natmosphere. 4. It should be at a distance from swampy ground or valleys\r\nthat are liable to be covered with fogs and exhalations. 5. It should\r\nnot, if possible, be too near public roads, particularly if paved with\r\nstones, and frequented by heavy carriages, as in such situations,\r\nundulations and tremulous motions may be produced, injurious to the\r\nmaking of accurate observations with graduated instruments. 6. It is\r\nexpedient that the astronomical observer should have access to some\r\ndistant field within a mile of the observatory, on which a meridian\r\nmark may be fixed, after his graduated instruments are properly\r\nadjusted. The distance at which a meridian mark should be erected will\r\ndepend in part on the focal length of the telescope generally used\r\nfor making observations on the Right Ascensions and declinations of\r\nthe stars. It should be fixed at such a distance that the mark may\r\nbe distinctly seen without altering the focus of the telescope when\r\nadjusted to the sun or stars, which, in most cases, will require to be\r\nat least half a mile from the place of observation, and more if it can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nObservatories may be distinguished into public and private. A _private_\r\nobservatory may be comprehended in a comparatively small building, or\r\nin the wing of a building of ordinary dimensions for a family, provided\r\nthe situation is adapted to it. Most of our densely-peopled towns\r\nand cities, which abound in narrow streets and lanes, are generally\r\nunfit for good observatories, unless at an elevated position at their\r\nextremities. Public observatories, where a great variety of instruments\r\nis used, and where different observers are employed, require buildings\r\nof larger dimensions, divided into a considerable number of apartments.\r\nThe observatory of _Greenwich_ is composed principally of two separate\r\nbuildings--one of which is the observatory properly so called, where\r\nthe assistant lives and makes all his observations; the other is the\r\ndwelling-house in which the astronomer-royal resides. The former\r\nconsists of three rooms on the ground-floor, the middle of which is\r\nthe assistant’s sitting and calculating room, furnished with a small\r\nlibrary of such books only as are necessary for his computations, and\r\nan accurate clock made by the celebrated Graham, which once served Dr.\r\nHalley as a transit-clock. Immediately over this is the assistant’s\r\nbed-room, with an alarum to awake him to make his observations at\r\nthe proper time. The room on the eastern side of this is called the\r\n_transit_-room, in which is an 8 feet transit instrument, with an\r\naxis of 3 feet, resting on 2 pieces of stone, made by Mr. Bird, but\r\nsuccessively improved by Messrs. Dollond, Troughton and others. Here\r\nis also a chair to observe with, the back of which lets down to any\r\ndegree of elevation that convenience may require. On the western side\r\nis the _quadrant room_, with a stone pier in the middle running north\r\nand south, having on its eastern face a mural quadrant of 8 feet\r\nradius, by which observations are made on the southern quarter of the\r\nmeridian, through an opening in the roof, of 3 feet wide, produced by\r\nmeans of two sliding shutters. On the western face is another mural\r\nquadrant of 8 feet radius, the frame of which is of iron, and the arch\r\nof brass, which is occasionally applied to the north quarter of the\r\nmeridian. In the same room is the famous zenith sector, 12 feet long,\r\nwith which Dr. Bradley made the observations which led to the discovery\r\nof the nutation of the earth’s axis and the aberration of the light\r\nof the fixed stars. Here are also Dr. Hooke’s reflecting quadrant and\r\nthree time-keepers by Harrison. On the south side of this room a small\r\nwooden building is erected for the purpose of observing the eclipses\r\nof Jupiter’s satellites, occultations of stars by the moon, and other\r\nphenomena which require merely the use of a telescope, and the true\r\nor mean time. It is furnished with sliding shutters on the roof and\r\nsides to view any part of the hemisphere from the Prime Vertical down\r\nto the southern horizon. It contains a 40-inch achromatic, with a\r\ntriple object-glass; and also a 5 feet achromatic by Messrs. John and\r\nPeter Dollond--a 2 feet reflecting telescope by Edwards, and a 6 feet\r\nreflector by Herschel. Above the dwelling-house is a large octagonal\r\nroom, which is made the repository for certain old instruments, and for\r\nthose which are too large to be used in the other apartments. Among\r\nmany other instruments, it contains an excellent 10 feet achromatic by\r\nDollond, and a 6 feet reflector by Short. Upon a platform, in an open\r\nspace, is erected the great reflecting telescope constructed by Mr.\r\nRamage of Aberdeen, on the Herschelian principle, which has a speculum\r\nof 15 inches diameter, and 25 feet focal length, remarkable for the\r\ngreat accuracy and brilliancy with which it exhibits celestial objects.\r\nVarious other instruments of a large size, and of modern construction,\r\nhave of late years been introduced into this observatory, such as the\r\nlarge and splendid transit instrument constructed by Troughton, in\r\n1816--the two large _mural circles_ by Troughton and Jones--the transit\r\nclock, by Mr. Hardy, and several other instruments and apparatus which\r\nit would be too tedious to enumerate and describe.\r\n\r\nEvery observatory, whether public or private, should be furnished with\r\nthe following instruments. 1. A transit instrument for observing the\r\nmeridian passage of the sun, planets and stars. 2. A good clock whose\r\naccuracy may be depended upon. 3. An achromatic telescope, at least\r\n44 inches focal distance, with powers of from 45 to 180 for viewing\r\nplanetary and other phenomena--or, a good reflecting telescope at least\r\n3 feet long, and the speculum 5 inches diameter. 4. An equatorial\r\ninstrument, for viewing the stars and planets in the day-time, and for\r\nfinding the Right Ascension and declination of a comet, or any other\r\ncelestial phenomenon. Where this instrument is possessed, and in cases\r\nwhere no great degree of accuracy is required, the equatorial may be\r\nmade to serve the general purposes of a transit instrument.\r\n\r\nA private observatory might be constructed in any house which has a\r\ncommanding view of the heavens, provided there is an apartment in it,\r\nin which windows may be placed, or openings cut out fronting the north,\r\nthe south, the east and the west. The author of this work has a small\r\nobservatory erected on the top of his house, which commands a view of\r\n20 miles towards the east, 30 miles towards the west, and north-west,\r\nand about 20 miles towards the south, at an elevation of above 200 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, and the banks of the Tay, which are about\r\nhalf a mile distant. The apartment is 12-1/2 feet long by 8-1/2 wide,\r\nand 8-1/2 feet between the floor and the roof. It has an opening on\r\nthe north by which observations can be made on the pole-star; a window\r\non the south by which the meridian-passages of the heavenly bodies may\r\nbe observed; another opening towards the east, and a fourth opening,\r\nconsisting of a door, towards the west. There is a pavement of lead\r\non the outside, all around the observatory-room, enclosed by a stone\r\nparapet 3-1/2 feet high, the upper part of which is coped with broad\r\nflat stones, in certain parts of which groves or indentations are made\r\nfor receiving the feet of the pedestal of an achromatic telescope,\r\nwhich form a steady support for the telescope in the open air, when\r\nthe weather is calm and serene, and when observations are intended\r\nto be made on any region of the heavens. By placing an instrument\r\non this parapet, it may be directed to any point of the celestial\r\ncanopy, except a small portion near the northern horizon, which is\r\npartly intercepted by a small hill. In the following ground-plan, fig.\r\n91. AAA, is the parapet surrounding the observatory-room; BBB, a walk\r\naround it nearly 3 feet broad, covered with lead. O is the apartment\r\nfor the observatory, having an opening C to the north, another opening\r\nD to the east, E is a window which fronts the south, and F is a door\r\nfronting the west, by which an access is obtained to the open area on\r\nthe outside. GHI is an area on the outside towards the south, covered\r\nwith lead, 15 feet long from G to H, and 6-1/2 feet from E to I, from\r\nwhich a commanding view of the southern, eastern and western portions\r\nof the heavens may be obtained: _eeee_ are positions on the top of the\r\nparapet where a telescope may be conveniently placed, when observations\r\nare intended to be made in the open air. The top of this parapet is\r\nelevated about 30 feet from the level of the ground. On the roof of\r\nthe observatory, about 12 feet above its floor, on the outside is a\r\nplatform of lead, surrounded by a railing, 6 feet by 5, with a seat,\r\non which observations either on celestial or terrestrial objects may\r\noccasionally be made. K is a door or hatchway, which forms an entrance\r\ninto the observatory from the apartments below, which folds down, and\r\nforms a portion of the floor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 91._]\r\n\r\nIn the perspective view of the building fronting the title-page, the\r\nposition and general aspect of the observatory-part of the building may\r\nbe more distinctly perceived.\r\n\r\nIn public observatories, where zenith or polar distances require to be\r\nmeasured, it is necessary that there should be a dome, with an opening\r\nacross the roof and down the north and south walls. Should an altitude\r\nor azimuth circle, or an equatorial instrument be used, they will\r\nrequire a revolving roof with openings and doors on two opposite sides,\r\nto enable an observer to follow a heavenly body across all the cardinal\r\npoints. The openings may be about 15 inches wide, and the roof needs\r\nnot be larger than what is requisite for giving room to the observer\r\nand the instrument, lest its bulk and weight should impede its easy\r\nmotion. There have been various plans adopted for revolving domes.\r\nFig. 92 represents a section of the rotatory dome constructed at East\r\nSheen by the Rev. Dr. Pearson. This dome turns round on three detached\r\nspheres of lignum vitæ, in a circular bed, formed partly by the dome,\r\nand partly by the cylindrical frame-work, which surrounds the circular\r\nroom of 9 feet diameter. A section of this bed forms a square which the\r\nsphere just fills, so as to have a small play to allow for shrinking;\r\nand, when the dome is carried round, the spheres, having exactly\r\nequal diameters of 4-1/4 inches each, when placed at equal distances\r\nfrom one another, keep their relative places, and move together in a\r\nbeautifully smooth manner. These spheres act as friction rollers in\r\ntwo directions at the four points of contact, in case any obstacle is\r\nopposed to their progressive motion by the admission of dirt, or by\r\nany change of figure of the wood that composes the rings of the dome,\r\nand of the gang-way. No groove is here made, but what the weight of\r\nthe roof resting on the hard sphere occasions. The dome itself moves\r\ntwice round for the balls once, and has, in this way, its friction\r\ndiminished. The wood of this dome is covered by Wyatt’s patent copper,\r\none square foot of which weighs upwards of a pound; and the copper is\r\nso turned over the nails that fix it at the parts of junction, that not\r\na single nail is seen in the whole dome. This covering is intended to\r\nrender the dome more permanent than if it had been made of wood alone.\r\nAt the observatory at Cambridge the dome is made chiefly of iron. In\r\nthe figure _a_, _a_ represents one of the two oblong doors that meet\r\nat the apex of the cone, and a piece of sheet-copper bent over the\r\nupper end of the door which shuts last, keeps the rain from entering at\r\nthe place of junction. The two halves of the dome are united by brass\r\nrods passing through the door-cheeks of wainscot at _a_ and _a_ by\r\nmeans of nuts that screw upon their ends, which union allows the dome\r\nto be separated into two parts when there may be occasion to displace\r\nit. The wooden plate _bb_, which appears in a straight line, is a\r\ncircular broad ring to which the covering wainscot boards are made fast\r\nabove the eaves, and _cc_ is a similar ring forming the wall-plate or\r\ngang-way on which the dome rests and revolves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 92._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 92_*.]\r\n\r\nFig. 92* shows a small door that lies over the summit of the dome, and\r\nmay be separately opened for zenith observations; the rod of metal with\r\na ring at the lower end passing through it, serves to open and shut\r\nthis door, and at the same time carries upon its upper end a large ball\r\nthat falls back on the roof when the door is open, and keeps the door\r\nin a situation to be acted upon by the hook of a handle that is used\r\nfor this purpose. The doors _aa_ being curved, are made to open in two\r\nhalves, the upper one being opened first, on account of its covering\r\nthe end of the other; and the observer may open one or two doors as may\r\nbest suit his purpose. The weight of this dome is such that a couple of\r\nwedges, inserted by a gentle blow between the rings _bb_ and _cc_, will\r\nkeep it in its situation under the influence of the strongest wind.\r\n\r\nIt may not be improper to remark, that in all observatories, and in\r\nevery apartment where celestial observations are made, there should,\r\nif possible, be a uniform temperature; and consequently a fire should\r\nnever be kept in such places, particularly when observations are\r\nintended to be made, as it would cause currents of air through the\r\ndoors and other openings, which would be injurious to the accuracy of\r\nobservations. When a window is opened in an ordinary apartment where a\r\nfire is kept, there is a current of heated air which rushes out at the\r\ntop, and a current of cold air which rushes in from below, producing\r\nagitations and undulations, which prevent even a good telescope from\r\nshowing celestial objects distinct and well defined; and, I have no\r\ndoubt, that many young observers have been disappointed in their\r\nviews of celestial phenomena, from this circumstance, when viewing\r\nthe heavenly bodies from heated rooms in cold winter evenings; as the\r\naërial undulations before the telescope prevent distinct vision of such\r\nobjects as the belts of Jupiter, the spots of Mars, and the rings of\r\nSaturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nON ORRERIES OR PLANETARIUMS.\r\n\r\nAn orrery is a machine for representing the order, the motions, the\r\nphases, and other phenomena of the planets. Although orreries and\r\nplanetariums are not so much in use as they were half a century ago,\r\nyet as they tend to assist the conceptions of the astronomical tyro in\r\nregard to the motions, order, and positions of the bodies which compose\r\nthe solar system, it may not be inexpedient shortly to describe the\r\nprinciples and construction of some of these machines.\r\n\r\nThe reason why the name _Orrery_ was at first given to such machines,\r\nis said to have been owing to the following circumstance. Mr. Rowley,\r\na mathematical-instrument-maker, having got one from Mr. George\r\nGraham, the original inventor, to be sent abroad with some of his own\r\ninstruments, he copied it and made the first for the Earl of Orrery.\r\nSir R. Steele, who knew nothing of Mr. Graham’s machine--thinking to\r\ndo justice to the first encourager, as well as to the inventor of such\r\na curious instrument, called it an _Orrery_, and gave Mr. Rowley the\r\npraise due to Mr. Graham. The construction of such machines is not\r\na modern invention. The hollow sphere of Archimedes was a piece of\r\nmechanism of this kind, having been intended to exhibit the motions\r\nof the sun, the moon, and the five planets, according to the Ptolemaic\r\nsystem. The next orrery of which we have any account was that of\r\nPosidonius, who lived about 80 years before the Christian era, of which\r\nCicero says, ‘If any man should carry the sphere of Posidonius into\r\nScythia or Britain, in every revolution of which the motions of the\r\nsun, moon and five planets, were the same as in the heavens, each day\r\nand night, who in those barbarous countries could doubt of its being\r\nfinished--not to say actuated--by perfect reason?’ The next machine of\r\nthis kind, which history records, was constructed by the celebrated\r\nBoethius, the Christian Philosopher, about the year of Christ 510--of\r\nwhich it was said ‘that it was a machine pregnant with the universe--a\r\nportable heaven--a compendium of all things.’ After this period, we\r\nfind no instances of such mechanism of any note till the 16th century,\r\nwhen science began to revive, and the arts to flourish. About this time\r\nthe curious clock in Hampton Court Palace was constructed, which shows\r\nnot only the hours of the day, but the motions of the sun and moon\r\nthrough all the signs of the zodiac, and other celestial phenomena.\r\nAnother piece of mechanism of a similar kind is the clock in the\r\ncathedral of Strasburg, in which besides the clock part, is a celestial\r\nglobe or sphere with the motions of the sun, moon, planets and the\r\nfirmament of the fixed stars, which was finished in 1574.\r\n\r\nAmong the largest and most useful pieces of machinery of this kind, is\r\nthe great sphere erected by Dr. Long in Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.\r\nThis machine, which he called the _Uranium_, consists of a planetarium\r\nwhich exhibits the motion of the earth and the primary planets, the\r\nsun, and the motion of the moon round the earth, all enclosed within a\r\nsphere. Upon the sphere, besides the principal circles of the celestial\r\nglobe, the Zodiac is placed, of a breadth sufficient to contain the\r\napparent path of the moon, with all the stars over which the moon\r\ncan pass, also the ecliptic, and the heliocentric orbits of all the\r\nplanets. The Earth in the planetarium has a moveable horizon, to which\r\na large moveable brass circle within the sphere may be set coincident,\r\nrepresenting the plane of the horizon continued to the starry heavens.\r\nThe horizons being turned round sink below the stars on the east side,\r\nand make them appear to rise, and rise above the stars on the west\r\nside, and make them appear to set. On the other hand, the earth and the\r\nhorizon being at rest, the sphere may be turned round to represent the\r\napparent diurnal motion of the heavens. In order to complete his idea\r\non a large scale, the Doctor erected a sphere of 18 feet diameter, in\r\nwhich above 30 persons might sit conveniently, the entrance to which is\r\nover the South Pole, by six steps. The frame of the sphere consists of\r\na number of iron meridians, the northern ends of which are screwed to\r\na large round plate of brass with a hole in the centre of it; through\r\nthis hole, from a beam in the ceiling, comes the north pole, a round\r\niron rod about three inches long, and which supports the upper part of\r\nthe sphere, to its proper elevation for the latitude of Cambridge, so\r\nmuch of it as is invisible in England being cut off, and the lower or\r\nsouthern ends of the meridians terminate on, and are screwed down to a\r\nstrong circle of oak 13 feet diameter, which, when the sphere is put in\r\nmotion, runs upon large rollers of lignum vitæ, in the manner that the\r\ntops of some wind-mills turn round. Upon the iron meridians is fixed\r\na zodiac of tin painted blue, on which the ecliptic and heliocentric\r\norbits of the planets are drawn and the stars and constellations\r\ntraced. The whole is turned round with a small winch, with as little\r\nlabour as it takes to wind up a Jack, although the weight of the iron,\r\ntin, and the wooden circle is above a thousand pounds. This machine,\r\nthough now somewhat neglected, may still be seen in Pembroke Hall,\r\nCambridge, where I had an opportunity of inspecting it in November,\r\n1839. The essential parts of the machine still remain nearly in the\r\nsame state as when originally constructed in 1758.\r\n\r\nThe machine which I shall now describe is of a much smaller and less\r\ncomplex description than that which has been noticed above, and may\r\nbe made for a comparatively small expense, while it exhibits, with\r\nsufficient accuracy, the motions, phases, and positions of all the\r\nprimary planets, with the exception of the new planets, which cannot be\r\naccurately represented on account of their orbits crossing each other.\r\nIn order to the construction of the Planetarium to which I allude, we\r\nmust compare the proportion which the annual revolutions of the primary\r\nplanets bear to that of the Earth. This proportion is expressed in the\r\nfollowing table, in which the first column is the time of the Earth’s\r\nperiod in days; the second, that of the planets; and the third and\r\nfourth are numbers very nearly in the same proportion to each other.\r\n\r\n  365-1/4  :     88      ::    83  :   20 for Mercury.\r\n  365-1/4  :    224-2/3  ::    52  :   32 for Venus.\r\n  365-1/4  :    687      ::    40  :   75 for Mars.\r\n  365-1/4  :   4332-1/2  ::     7  :   83 for Jupiter.\r\n  365-1/4  :  10759-1/3  ::     5  :  148 for Saturn.\r\n  365-1/4  :  30686      ::     3  :  253 for Uranus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 93._]\r\n\r\nOn account of the number of teeth required for the wheel which moves\r\nUranus, it is frequently omitted in Planetariums, or the planet is\r\nplaced upon the arbor which supports Saturn. If we now suppose a\r\nspindle or arbor with six wheels _fixed_ upon it in an horizontal\r\nposition, having the number of teeth in each corresponding to the\r\nnumbers in the third column, namely the wheel AM (fig. 93.) of 83\r\nteeth, BL of 52, CK of 50, for the earth, DI of 40, EH of 7, and FG\r\nof 5; and another set of wheels moving freely about an arbor having\r\nthe number of teeth in the fourth column, namely AN of 20, BO of 32,\r\nCP of 50--for the earth; DQ of 75, ER of 83, and FS of 148. Then, if\r\nthese two arbors of fixed and moveable wheels be made of the size,\r\nand fixed at the distance here represented, the teeth of the former\r\nwill take hold of those of the latter, and turn them freely when the\r\nmachine is in motion. These arbors, with their wheels, are to be placed\r\nin a box of a proper size, in a perpendicular position; the arbor of\r\nfixed wheels to move in pivots at the top and bottom of the box, and\r\nthe arbor of the moveable wheels to go through the top of the box,\r\nand having on the top a wire fixed, and bent at a proper distance\r\ninto a right angle upwards, bearing on the top a small round ball,\r\nrepresenting its proper planet. If then, on the lower part of the arbor\r\nof fixed wheels, be placed a pinion of screw-teeth, a winch turning a\r\nspindle with an endless screw, playing in the teeth of the arbor, will\r\nturn it with all its wheels, and these wheels will turn the others\r\nabout with their planets, in their proper and respective periods of\r\ntime. For, while the fixed wheel CK moves its equal CP once round, the\r\nwheel AM will move AN a little more than four times round, and will\r\nconsequently exhibit the motion of Mercury; the wheel EH will turn the\r\nwheel ER about 1/12 round, representing the proportional motion of\r\nJupiter; and the wheel FG will turn the wheel FS, about 1/29.5 round,\r\nand represent the motion of Saturn, and so of all the rest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 94._]\r\n\r\nThe following figure (fig. 94.) represents the appearance of the\r\ninstrument when completed. Upon the upper part of the circular box\r\nis pasted a Zodiac circle divided into 12 signs, and each sign into\r\n30 degrees, with the corresponding days of the month. The wheel-work\r\nis understood to be within the box, which may either be supported by\r\na tripod, or with four feet, as here represented. The moon, and the\r\nsatellites of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, are moveable only by the\r\nhand. When the winch W is turned, then all the primary planets are\r\nmade to move in their respective velocities. The ball in the centre\r\nrepresents the Sun, which is either made of brass or of wood gilded\r\nwith gold.\r\n\r\nBy this Planetarium, simple as its construction may appear, a variety\r\nof interesting exhibitions may be made and problems performed, which\r\nmay be conducive to the instruction of young students of astronomy. I\r\nshall mention only a few of those as specimens.\r\n\r\n1. When the planets are placed in their respective positions by means\r\nof an Ephemeris or the Nautical Almanack, the relative positions of\r\nthose bodies in respect to each other, the quarters of the heavens\r\nwhere they may be observed, and whether they are to be seen in the\r\nmorning before sun-rise or in the evening after sun-set, may be at\r\nonce determined. For example, on the 19th of December, 1844, the\r\n_heliocentric_ places of the planets are as follows:--Uranus 2° Aries;\r\nSaturn 8° 27´ of Aquarius; Jupiter 7° 4´ Aries; Mars 12° 45´ Libra;\r\nthe Earth 27° 46´ Gemini; Venus 29° 48´ Virgo; Mercury 7° 53´ Pisces.\r\nWhen the planets are placed on the planetarium in these positions, and\r\nthe eye placed in a line with the balls representing the Earth and the\r\nSun, all those situated to the left of the sun are to the east of\r\nhim, and are to be seen in the evening, and those on the right, in the\r\nmorning. In the present case, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury are\r\nevening stars, and Mars and Venus can only be seen in the morning.\r\nJupiter is in an aspect nearly _quartile_, or 3 signs distant from the\r\nsun, and Uranus is nearly in the same aspect. Saturn is much nearer the\r\nsun, and Mercury is not far from the period of its greatest _eastern_\r\nelongation. Mars is not far from being in a quartile aspect, _west_ of\r\nthe sun, and Venus is near the same point of the heavens, approaching\r\nto the period of its greatest _western_ elongation, and consequently\r\nwill be seen before sun-rise as a beautiful morning star. Jupiter and\r\nUranus, to the east of the sun, appear nearly directly opposite to\r\nVenus and Mars, which are to the west of the sun. The phase[47] of\r\nVenus is nearly that of a half-moon, and Mercury is somewhat gibbous,\r\napproaching to a half-moon phase. If, now, we turn the machine by the\r\nwinch till the Index of the earth point at the 8th of August, 1845, we\r\nshall find the planets in the following positions:--Mars and Saturn are\r\nnearly in opposition to the sun; Venus and Mercury are evening stars at\r\nno great distance from each other, and Jupiter is a morning star. In\r\nlike manner if we turn the machine till the Index point to any future\r\nmonths, or even succeeding years, the various aspects and positions of\r\nthe planets may be plainly perceived. When the planets are moved by the\r\nwinch, in this machine, we see them all _at once_ in motion around the\r\nsun, with the same respective velocities and periods of revolution\r\nwhich they have in the heavens. As the planets are represented in the\r\npreceding positions, Mercury, Jupiter and Mars, are evening stars,\r\nand Venus, Saturn, and Uranus, morning stars, if we suppose the earth\r\nplaced in a line with our eye and the sun.\r\n\r\n2. By this instrument, the truth of the Copernican or Solar system is\r\nclearly represented. When the planets are in motion, we perceive the\r\nplanets Venus and Mercury to pass both before and behind the sun, and\r\nto have two conjunctions. We observe Mercury to be never more than\r\na certain angular distance from the sun, as viewed from the earth,\r\nnamely 27°; and Venus 47°. We perceive that the superior planets,\r\nparticularly Mars, will be sometimes much nearer to the earth than at\r\nothers, and therefore must appear larger at one time than at another,\r\nas they actually appear in the heavens. We see that the planets cannot\r\nappear from the earth to move with uniform velocity; for when nearest\r\nthey appear to move faster, and slower when most remote. We likewise\r\nobserve that the planets appear from the earth to move sometimes\r\n_direct_, or from west to east, then become retrograde, or from east\r\nto west, and between both to be _stationary_. All which particulars\r\nexactly correspond with celestial observations. For illustrating these\r\nparticulars there is a simple apparatus represented by fig. 95, which\r\nconsists of a hollow wire with a slit at top which is placed over the\r\narm of Mercury or Venus at E. The arm DG represents a ray of light\r\ncoming from the planet at D to the earth at F. The planets being then\r\nin motion, the planet D, as seen in the heavens from the earth at F,\r\nwill undergo the several changes of position, which we have described\r\nabove, sometimes appearing to go backwards and at other times forwards.\r\nThe wire prop, now supposed to be placed over Mercury at E, may\r\nlikewise be placed over any of the other planets, particularly Mars,\r\nand similar phenomena will be exhibited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 95._]\r\n\r\nThis machine may likewise be used to exhibit the falsity of the\r\nPtolemaic system, which places the Earth in the centre, and supposes\r\nthe sun and all the planets to revolve around it. For this purpose, the\r\nball representing the Sun is removed, and placed on the wire or pillar\r\nwhich supports the Earth, and the ball representing the Earth is placed\r\nin the centre. It will then be observed, that the planets Mercury and\r\nVenus, being both within the orbit of the sun, cannot at any time be\r\nseen to go behind it, whereas, in the heavens we as often see them go\r\nbehind as before the sun. Again, it shows that as the planets move in\r\ncircular orbits about the central earth, they ought at all times to\r\nappear of the same magnitude; while, on the contrary, we observe their\r\napparent magnitudes in the heavens to be very variable; Mars, for\r\nexample, appearing sometimes nearly as large as Jupiter, and at other\r\ntimes only like a small fixed star. Again, it is here shown that the\r\nplanets may be seen at all distances from the sun; for example, when\r\nthe sun is setting, Mercury and Venus, according to this arrangement,\r\nmight be seen, not only in the south but even in the eastern quarter\r\nof the heavens--a phenomenon which was never yet observed in any age;\r\nMercury never appearing beyond 27° of the Sun, nor Venus beyond 48°.\r\nIn short, according to the system thus represented, it is seen, that\r\nthe motions of the planets should all be regular, and uniformly the\r\nsame in every part of their orbits, and that they should all move the\r\nsame way, namely from west to east; whereas, in the heavens, they are\r\nseen to move with variable velocities, sometimes appearing stationary,\r\nand sometimes moving from east to west, and from west to east. All\r\nwhich circumstances plainly prove that the Ptolemaic cannot be the true\r\nsystem of the universe.\r\n\r\n    A Planetarium, such as that now described, might be constructed\r\n    with brass wheel-work, for about 5 guineas. The brass\r\n    wheel-work of one which I long since constructed cost about 3\r\n    guineas, and the other parts of the apparatus about 2 guineas\r\n    more. The following are the prices of some instruments of this\r\n    kind as made by Messrs. Jones, 30, Lower Holborn, London. ‘An\r\n    Orrery, showing the motions of the Earth, Moon, and inferior\r\n    planets, Mercury and Venus, by wheel-work, the board on which\r\n    the instrument moves being 13 inches diameter, £4: 14s. 6d.’ ‘A\r\n    Planetarium showing the motions of all the primary planets by\r\n    wheel-work with 1-1/2 inch or 3 inch papered globes,--according\r\n    to the wheel-work and the neatness of the stands, from £7:\r\n    17s. 6d. to £10: 10s.’ ‘Ditto, with wheel-work to show the\r\n    parallelism of the Earth’s axis, the motions of the Moon, her\r\n    phases, &c., £18: 18s.’ ‘Ditto, with wheel-work, to show the\r\n    earth’s diurnal motion, on a brass stand in mahogany case, £22:\r\n    1s.’ ‘A small _Tellurian_, showing the motion of the Earth and\r\n    Moon, &c., £1: 8s.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHENDERSON’S PLANETARIUM.\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of the most complete and accurate\r\nplanetarium I have yet seen. The calculations occupied more than eight\r\nmonths. For this article I am indebted to my learned and ingenious\r\nfriend Dr. Henderson, F.R.A.S., who is known to many of my readers by\r\nhis excellent astronomical writings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 96._]\r\n\r\nSection of the wheel-work of a Planetarium for shewing with the utmost\r\ndegree of accuracy the mean tropical revolutions of the planets round\r\nthe sun, calculated by E. Henderson, LL.D. &c.\r\n\r\nIn the above section the dark horizontal lines represent the wheel-work\r\nof the Planetarium, and the annexed numerals, the numbers of teeth in\r\nthe given wheel. The machine has three axes or arbors, indicated by\r\nthe letters A, B, C.--Axis ‘C,’ the ‘Yearly axis,’ is assumed to make\r\none revolution in 365.242,236 days, or, in 365 days 5^h 48^m 49.19^s\r\nand is furnished with wheels 17, 44, 54, 36, 140, 96, 127, 86, which\r\nwheels are all firmly riveted to said axis, and consequently they turn\r\nround with it in the same time. Axle ‘B’ is a fixture; it consists\r\nof a steel rod, on which a system of pairs of wheels revolve; thus\r\nwheels 40 and 77 are made fast together by being riveted on the same\r\ncollet represented by the thick dark space between them, as also of\r\nthe rest: the several wheels on this axis may be written down thus;\r\n40/77, 49/129, 20/94, 79/81, 30, 27/50, 41/65, 59/65, 96, 77/47, 67/42.\r\nOn axis A a system of wheels, furnished with tubes revolve, and these\r\ntubes carry horizontal arms, supporting perpendicular stems with the\r\nplanets. The wheels on this axis are 173, 117/190, 111, 119, 122/130,\r\n123/127, 83, 239, 96, 128, 72. From the following short description\r\nthe nature of their several actions will, it is presumed, be readily\r\nunderstood--viz.,\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MERCURY’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nOn the axis ‘C’ at the bottom is wheel 86, which turns round in 365\r\ndays 5^h 48^m 49.19^s, this wheel impels a small wheel of 22 teeth, to\r\nwhich is made fast to wheel 67, both revolving together at the foot\r\nof axis B; wheel 67 drives a wheel of 72 once round in the period of\r\n87 days, 23^h 14^m 36.1^s: this last mentioned wheel has a long tube,\r\nwhich turns on the steel axis A, and carries a horizontal arm with the\r\nplanet Mercury round the sun in the time above noted.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: VENUS’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nOn axis ‘C’ is wheel 127, which drives wheel 47, to which is riveted a\r\nwheel of 77 teeth, which impels a wheel of 128 teeth on axis A, and\r\ncauses it to make a revolution in 224 days, 16^h 41^m 31.1^s, and is\r\nfurnished with a tube, which revolves over that of Mercury and ascends\r\nthrough the cover of the machine, and bears an arm on which is placed a\r\nsmall ball representing this planet in the time stated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: THE EARTH’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe motion of the earth round the sun is simply effected as\r\nfollows--the assumed value of axis ‘C;’ the ‘Yearly axis’ is 365 days\r\n5^h 48^m 49.19^s; hence a system of wheels having the same numbers of\r\nteeth, or at all events, the first mover, and last wheel impelled must\r\nbe equal in their numbers of teeth; in this machine three wheels are\r\nemployed, thus; a wheel having 96 teeth is made fast to the Yearly\r\naxis C and of course moves round with it in a mean solar year, as\r\nabove noted, this wheel impels another wheel of 96 teeth, on axis B,\r\nand this in its turns drives a third wheel of 96 teeth on axis A, and\r\nis furnished with a long tube which revolves over that of Venus, and\r\nascends above the cover-plate of the machine, and bears a horizontal\r\narm which supports a small terrestrial globe, which revolves by virtue\r\nof said wheels once round the sun in 365 days 5^h 48^m 49.19^s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: MARS’ PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe revolution of this planet is effected as follows--a wheel of 140\r\nteeth is made fast to the yearly axis C, and drives on axis B a wheel\r\nof 65 teeth, to which is fixed a wheel of 59 teeth, which impels a\r\nlarge wheel of 239 teeth on axis A once round the sun in 686 days\r\n22^h 18^m 33.6^s, this last-mentioned wheel is also furnished with a\r\ntube which revolves over that of the earth, and carries a horizontal\r\narm bearing the ball representing Mars, and causes it to complete a\r\nrevolution round the sun in the period named.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ASTEROIDS._ VESTA’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe period of Vesta is accomplished thus, viz. On the Yearly axis C,\r\nis made fast a wheel of 36 teeth, which drives a wheel of 65 teeth on\r\naxis B, to which is fixed a wheel of 41 teeth, which impels a wheel of\r\n83 teeth on axis A, once round in 1336 days 0^h 21^m 19.8^s: The tube\r\nof which last wheel ascends on that of Mars, and like the rest bears an\r\narm supporting a ball representing this planet.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JUNO’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nFor the revolution of Juno, the yearly axis C is furnished with a wheel\r\nof 54 teeth, which impels a wheel of 50 teeth on axis B, to which is\r\nmade fast a wheel of 27 teeth which turns a wheel of 127 teeth on axis\r\nA, once round in 1590 days 17^h 35^m 2.7^s, and the tube of which\r\nascends on that of Vesta, and supports a horizontal arm which carries a\r\nsmall ball representing this planet in the period named.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: CERES’ PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe revolution of Ceres is derived from the period of Juno, because\r\nwheel-work taken from the unit of a solar year was not sufficiently\r\naccurate for the purpose, therefore on Juno’s wheel of 127 teeth is\r\nfixed a wheel of 123 teeth, which drives a thick little bevel sort\r\nof wheel of 30 teeth on axis B: the reason of this small wheel being\r\nbevelled is to allow its teeth to suit both wheels 123/130; wheel 30\r\ndrives wheel 130, on axis A once round in 1681 days, 6^h 17^m 22.4^s\r\nand the tube of wheel 130 turns on the tube of Juno, and ascends in a\r\nsimilar manner with the rest and carries an horizontal arm supporting a\r\nsmall ball representing this planet, and is caused to revolve round the\r\nSun in the above mentioned period (the period of Ceres to that of Juno\r\nis as 130 is to 123; hence the wheels used.)\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: PALLAS’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe Period of Pallas could not be derived from the solar year with\r\nsufficient accuracy, and recourse was had to an engrafted fraction on\r\nthe period of Ceres, thus. On wheel 130 of Ceres is made fast a wheel\r\nof 122 teeth, which drives a wheel of 81 teeth on axis B, to which is\r\nfixed a wheel 79 which impels a wheel of 119 teeth on axis A, and is\r\nfurnished with a tube which ascends, and turns on that of Ceres, and\r\nsupports a horizontal arm, which bears a small ball representing this\r\nplanet, which by virtue of the above train of wheels is caused to\r\ncomplete a revolution round the Sun in 1681^d 10^h 28^m 25.1^s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: JUPITER’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe motion of this planet is derived from the period of a solar year;\r\nfrom the ‘yearly axis’ thus, on this axis is made fast a wheel of 44\r\nteeth which turns a wheel of 94 teeth on axis B, to which is riveted\r\na small wheel of 20 teeth, which impels a wheel on axis A having 111\r\nteeth, which is furnished with an ascending tube which revolves over\r\nthat of Pallas, and bears an horizontal arm which supports a ball\r\nrepresenting this planet, which by the said train of wheels is caused\r\nto revolve round the Sun in 4330^d 14^h 39^m 35.7^s.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: SATURN’S PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe periodic revolution of Saturn is also taken from the solar\r\nyear--viz., a small wheel of 17 teeth is fixed to the ‘yearly axis’\r\nnear its top, and drives a wheel of 129 teeth on axis B, to which is\r\nmade fast a wheel of 49 teeth, which turns a wheel of 190 teeth on\r\naxis A, whose tube ascends and revolves on that of Jupiter’s tube, and\r\nsupports an arm, having a ball representing Saturn and its rings, and\r\nwhich by the train of wheels is caused to perform a revolution round\r\nthe sun in the period of 10746^d 19^h 16^m 50.9^s.\r\n\r\nURANUS’S PERIOD.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of this planet could not be attained with sufficient\r\naccuracy from the period of a solar year--the period is engrafted on\r\nthat of Saturn’s, thus, a wheel of 117 teeth is made fast to wheel 190\r\nof Saturn, and consequently revolves in Saturn’s period. This wheel\r\nof 117 teeth drives a wheel on axis B, having 77 teeth, to which is\r\nfixed a wheel of 40 teeth, which turns on axis A, a large wheel of 173\r\nteeth, whose tube ascends and revolves over that of Saturn, and carries\r\na horizontal arm which supports a ball representing this planet, which\r\nis caused to complete its revolution by such a train of wheels in the\r\nperiod of 30589^d 8^h 26^m 58.4^s. Such is a brief description of the\r\nmotions of this comprehensive and very accurate machine.\r\n\r\nThe axis A, on which the planetary tubular wheels revolve, performs\r\na rotation in 25 days 10 hours, by virtue of the following train of\r\nwheels, 61/14 + 70/12 of 24 hours, that is, a pinion of 14 is assumed\r\nto revolve in 24 hours, and to drive a wheel of 61 teeth, to which is\r\nfixed a pinion of 12, which turns the wheel 70 in the period noted; to\r\nthis wheel-axis, it is made fast, and by revolving with it, exhibits\r\nthe Sun’s rotation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: DIURNAL HAND.]\r\n\r\nThe machine is turned by a handle or winch, which is assumed to turn\r\nround in 24 hours, and from this rotation of 24 hours a train of\r\nwheel-work is required to cause the ‘yearly axis’ C, to turn once\r\nround in 365^d 5^h 48^m 49.19^s, which is effected in the following\r\nmanner--viz, the train found by the process of the reduction of\r\ncontinuous fractions is 61/14 + 144/18 + 211/23 that is, in the train\r\nfor turning the sun, the same pinion 14 turns the same wheel 61,\r\nand turns a pinion of 18 leaves, to which is fixed a wheel of 144\r\nteeth, having a pinion of 23 leaves, which impels a large wheel of\r\n241 teeth once round in 365.242236^d or 365^d 5^h 48^m 49.19^s, this\r\nlast-mentioned wheel of 241 teeth is made fast to the under part of\r\nthe ‘yearly axis’ C at D, the handle having a pinion of 14 leaves\r\ntherefore, and transmitting its motion through the above train, causes\r\nthe yearly axis to revolve in the same period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: REGISTRATING DATES.]\r\n\r\nThe planetarium is also furnished with a system of wheels for\r\nregistrating dates for either 10,000 years past or to come, the\r\narrangement is not shewn in the engraving (to prevent confusion) but\r\nit might be shortly described thus:--Near the top of the yearly axis\r\nis a hooked piece _e_, which causes the tooth of a wheel of 100 teeth\r\nto start forward yearly, consequently 100 starts of said wheel will\r\ncause it to revolve in 100 solar years, and it has a hand which points\r\non a dial on the cover of the machine the years; thus for the present\r\nyear this hand will be over the number 45. This last-named wheel of\r\n100 teeth has a pin which causes a tooth of another wheel of 100 teeth\r\nto start once in 100 years, hence this last wheel will complete one\r\nrevolution in 10,000 years, and it is for this purpose the former index\r\nor hand moves over a number yearly. The second index will pass over a\r\nnumber every 100 years--for the present year the second hand or index\r\nwill be over the number 18, and will continue over it until the first\r\nindex moves forward to 99, then both indexes will move at one time,\r\nviz., the first index to 00 on the first concentric circle of the\r\ndial, and the second index to 19, denoting the year 1900, and so of\r\nthe rest. By the ecliptic being divided in a series of four spirals,\r\nthe machine makes a distinction between common and leap years, and\r\nindicates the common year as containing 365 days, and the leap-year 366\r\ndays, by taking in a day in February every fourth year; thus for any\r\ngiven period for 10,000 years past or to come, the various situations\r\nand aspects of the planets may be ascertained by operating with this\r\nmachine, and this for thousands of years without producing a sensible\r\nerror either in space or time. This planetarium wheel-work is enclosed\r\nin an elegant mahogany box of twelve sides--is about 5 feet in diameter\r\nby 10 inches in depth; at each of the twelve angles, or sides, small\r\nbrass pillars rise and support a large Ecliptic circle on which are\r\nengraven the signs, degrees and minutes of the Ecliptic--the days of\r\nthe month, &c. This mahogany box with the wheel-work is supported by a\r\ntripod stand three feet in height, and motion is communicated to the\r\nseveral balls representing the planets by turning the handle as before\r\ndescribed. A Planetarium of this complicated sort, costs sixty guineas.\r\n\r\nThe following is a tabular view of the wheel-work, periods, &c.\r\n\r\n  ----------+-----------------------------+---------------------+------------------\r\n  Planets’  |        Wheel-work.          | Tropical periods    |True mean Tropical\r\n  Names.    |                             | produced by the     | Periods of\r\n            |                             | wheel-work.         | the Planets.\r\n  ----------+-----------------------------+---------------------+------------------\r\n            |                             |    da. ho.  m.  s.  |   da. ho. m.  s.\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Mercury   |     22/85 + 67/72 of a Year |    87. 23. 14. 36.1 |   87. 23. 14. 36\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Venus     |          47/127 + 128/77 \"  |   224. 16. 41. 31.1 |  224. 16. 41. 36\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  The Earth |  Prime mover 96 + 96 + 96 \" |   365.  5. 48. 49.19|  365.  5. 48. 49\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Mars      |           65/140 + 239/59 \" |   686. 22. 18. 33.6 |  686. 22. 18. 34\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Vesta     |            65/36 + 83/41 \"  |  1335.  0. 21. 19.8 | 1335.  0. 21. 20\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Juno      |           50/54 + 127/27 \"  |  1590. 17. 35.  2.7 | 1590. 17. 35.  1\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Ceres     |       130/123 + 30 of Juno  |  1681.  6. 17. 22.4 | 1681.  6. 17. 29\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Pallas    |    81/122 + 119/79 of Ceres |  1681. 10. 28. 25.1 | 1681. 10. 28. 42\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Jupiter   |    94/44 + 111/20 of a Year |  4330. 14. 39. 35.7 | 4330. 14. 39. 32\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Saturn    |   129/17 + 190/49 \"         | 10746. 19. 16. 50.9 |10746. 19. 16. 52\r\n            |                             |                     |\r\n  Uranus    |   77/117 + 173/40 of Saturn | 30589.  8. 26. 58.4 |30589.  8. 26. 59\r\n  ----------+-----------------------------+---------------------+------------------\r\n  The Sun’s      61/14 + 70/12 of 24 ho.  |    25. 10.  0.  0   |   25. 10.  0.  1\r\n  Rotation                                |                     |\r\n  The tropical}  61/14 + 144/18 + 241/23 \"|   365.  5. 48. 49.19|  365.  5. 48. 49\r\n   period of  }                           |                     |\r\n  the Earth   }                           |                     |\r\n  roundthe    }                           |                     |\r\n  Sun.        }                           |                     |\r\n  ----------------------------------------+---------------------+------------------\r\n\r\nIn the month of October last year, Dr. Henderson made a series of\r\ncalculations for a new Planetarium for the use of schools. It shows\r\nwith considerable accuracy for 700 days, the mean tropical revolutions\r\nof the Planets round the sun--the machine consists of a system of brass\r\nwheels peculiarly arranged, and is enclosed in a circular case three\r\nfeet in diameter, the top of which has the signs and degrees of the\r\necliptic laid down on it, as also the days of the months, &c. This\r\nPlanetarium costs only 45s. or on a tripod stand, table-high, 55s.; the\r\nmachine is put in motion by a handle on the outside. To the teachers\r\nand others connected with education this Planetarium must be of great\r\nimportance, for without a proper elucidation of the principles of\r\nastronomy, that of Geography must be but confusedly understood. This\r\nPlanetarium is at present made by Mr. Dollond, 9, White Conduit Grove,\r\nIslington, London.\r\n\r\nThe _Tellurian_ is a small instrument which should be used in\r\nconnection with the Planetarium formerly described. This instrument is\r\nintended to show the annual motion of the earth, and the revolution\r\nof the moon around it. It also illustrates the moon’s phases, and the\r\nmotion of her nodes, the inclination of the Earth’s axis, the causes\r\nof eclipses, the variety of seams, and other phenomena. It consists of\r\nabout eight wheels, pinions and circles. A small instrument of this\r\ndescription may be purchased for about one pound eight shillings, as\r\nstated in the note, page 527.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE VARIOUS OPINIONS WHICH WERE ORIGINALLY FORMED OF SATURN’S RING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 97._]\r\n\r\nThe striking and singular phenomenon connected with the planet\r\nSaturn--though now ascertained beyond dispute to be a Ring, or Rings,\r\nsurrounding its body at a certain distance--was a subject of great\r\nmystery, and gave rise to numerous conjectures and controversies, for\r\na considerable time after the invention of the telescope by which it\r\nwas discovered. Though it was first discovered in the year 1610, it\r\nwas nearly 50 years afterwards, before its true form and nature were\r\ndetermined. Galileo was the first who discovered anything uncommon\r\nconnected with Saturn: through his telescope he thought he saw that\r\nplanet appear like two smaller globes on each side of a larger one; and\r\nafter viewing the planet in this form for two years, he was surprised\r\nto see it becoming quite round, without its adjoining globes, and\r\nsome time afterwards to appear in the triple form. This appearance\r\nis represented in fig. 1 of the above engraving. In the year 1614,\r\nScheiner, a German astronomer, published a representation of Saturn,\r\nin which this planet is exhibited as a large central globe, with two\r\nsmaller bodies, one on each side, partly of a conical form, attached to\r\nthe planet and forming a part of it, as shown fig. 2. In the year 1640\r\nand 1643, Ricciolus, an Italian mathematician and astronomer, imagined\r\nhe saw Saturn as represented in fig. 3. consisting of a central\r\nglobe, and two conical shaped bodies completely detached from it, and\r\npublished an account of it corresponding to this view. Hevelius, the\r\ncelebrated astronomer of Dantzig, author of the _Selenographia_ and\r\nother works, made many observations on this planet about the years\r\n1643, 1649 and 1650, in which he appears to have obtained different\r\nviews of the planet and its appendages, gradually approximating to the\r\ntruth, but still incorrect. These views are represented in figures\r\n4, 5, 6, and 7. Fig. 4 nearly resembles two hemispheres, one on each\r\nside of the globe of Saturn. The other figures very nearly resemble\r\nthe extreme parts of the ring as seen through a good telescope, but\r\nhe still seems to have considered them as detached from each other as\r\nwell as from Saturn. Figures 8 and 9 are views given by Ricciolus at a\r\nperiod posterior to that in which he supposed Saturn and his appendages\r\nin the form delineated in fig. 3. In these last delineations the\r\nplanet was supposed to be enclosed in an elliptical ring, but this ring\r\nwas supposed to be _fixed_ to its two opposite sides.\r\n\r\nFig. 10, is a representation by Eustachius Divini, a celebrated\r\nItalian optician at Bologna. The shades represented on Saturn and the\r\nelliptical curve are incorrect, as this planet presents no such shadowy\r\nform. The general appearance here presented is not much unlike that\r\nwhich the ring of Saturn exhibits, excepting that at the upper side the\r\nring should appear covering a portion of the orb of Saturn. But Divini\r\nseems to have conceived that the curve on each side was attached to the\r\nbody of Saturn. For when Huygens published his discovery of the ring\r\nof Saturn in 1659, Divini contested its truth, because he could not\r\nperceive the ring through his own telescopes; and he wrote a treatise\r\non the subject in opposition to Huygens, in 1660, entitled ‘Brevis\r\nAnnotatio in Systema Saturninum.’ Huygens immediately replied to him,\r\nand Divini wrote a rejoinder in 1661.--Fig. 11 is the representation\r\ngiven by Francis Fontana, a Neapolitan astronomer. This figure\r\nrepresents Saturn as having two crescents, one on each side, attached\r\nto its body, with intervals between the planet and the crescents. Fig.\r\n12 is a view delineated by Gassendus, a celebrated French philosopher.\r\nIt represents the planet as a large ellipsoid, having a large circular\r\nopening near each end, and, if this representation were the true one,\r\neach opening would be at least 30,000 miles in diameter. Fig. 13,\r\nwhich is perhaps the most singular of the whole, is said to be one\r\nof the view’s of this planet given by Ricciolus. It represents two\r\nglobes--each of which, in the proportion they here bear to Saturn, must\r\nbe more than thirty thousand miles in diameter. These globes, were\r\nconceived as being attached to the body of Saturn by curves or bands,\r\neach of which, in the proportion represented, must have been at least\r\n7000 miles in breadth, and nearly 40,000 miles long. This would have\r\nexhibited the planet Saturn as a still more singular body than what\r\nwe have found it to be; but no such construction of a planet has yet\r\nbeen found in the universe, nor is it probable that such a form of a\r\nplanetary body exists.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that only two general opinions should have been\r\nformed respecting the construction of Saturn--as appears from these\r\nrepresentations--either that this planet was composed of three distinct\r\nparts, separate from each other,--or that the appendage on each side\r\nwas _fixed_ to the body of the planet. The idea of a ring surrounding\r\nthe body of the planet, at a certain distance from every part of it,\r\nseems never to have been thought of till the celebrated Huygens, in\r\n1655, 1656 and 1657, by numerous observations made on this planet,\r\ncompletely demonstrated that it is surrounded by a solid and permanent\r\nring, which never changes its situation, and, without touching the\r\nbody of the planet, accompanies it in its revolution around the sun.\r\nAs the cause of all the erroneous opinions above stated was owing to\r\nthe imperfection of the telescopes which were then in use, and their\r\ndeficiency in magnifying power,--this ingenious astronomer set himself\r\nto work in order to improve telescopes for celestial observations. He\r\nimproved the art of grinding and polishing object-glasses, which he\r\nfinished with his own hands, and produced lenses of a more correct\r\nfigure, and of a longer focal distance than what had previously been\r\naccomplished. He first constructed a telescope 12 feet long, and\r\nafterwards one 23 feet long, which magnified about 95 times; whereas\r\nGalileo’s best telescope magnified only about 33 times. He afterwards\r\nconstructed one 123 feet long, which magnified about 220 times. It was\r\nused without a tube, the object-glass being placed upon the top of a\r\npole and connected by a cord with the eye-piece. With such telescopes\r\nthis ingenious artist and mathematician discovered the fourth satellite\r\nof Saturn, and demonstrated that the phenomenon, which had been so\r\negregiously misrepresented by preceding astronomers, consisted of an\r\nimmense ring surrounding the body, and completely detached from it. His\r\nnumerous observations and reasonings on this subject were published\r\nin Latin, in 1659, in a quarto volume of nearly 100 pages, entitled\r\n‘_Systema Saturnium, sive de causis mirandorum Saturni Phenomenôn, et\r\nComite ejus Planeta Nova_,’ from which work the figures and some of the\r\nfacts stated above have been extracted.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE SUPPOSED DIVISIONS OF THE EXTERIOR RING OF SATURN.\r\n\r\nFrom the period in which Huygens lived till the time when Herschel\r\napplied his large telescopes to the heavens, few discoveries were made\r\nin relation to Saturn. Cassini, in 1671, discovered the fifth satellite\r\nof this planet; in 1672, the third; and the first and second in March,\r\n1684. In 1675, Cassini saw the broad side of its ring bisected quite\r\nround by a dark elliptical line, of which the inner part appeared\r\nbrighter than the outer. In 1722, Mr. Hadley, with his 5 feet Newtonian\r\nReflector observed the same phenomenon, and perceived that the dark\r\nline was stronger next the body, and fainter towards the upper edge\r\nof the ring. Within the ring he also discovered two belts across the\r\ndisk of Saturn. But it does not appear that they had any idea that this\r\ndark line was empty space separating the ring into two parts. This\r\ndiscovery was reserved for the late Sir W. Herschel, who made numerous\r\nobservations on this planet, and likewise ascertained that the ring\r\nperforms a revolution round the planet in ten hours and thirty minutes.\r\n\r\nOf late years, some observers have supposed that the exterior ring\r\nof Saturn is divided into several parts, or, in other words, that it\r\nconsists of two or more concentric rings. The following are some of\r\nthe observations on which this opinion is founded. They are chiefly\r\nextracted from Captain Kater’s Paper on this subject, which was read\r\nbefore the Astronomical Society of London.\r\n\r\nThe observations, we are told, were made in the years 1825 and 1826,\r\nand remained unpublished, from a wish on the part of the observer\r\nto witness the appearances again. The planet Saturn has been much\r\nobserved by Captain Kater, for the purpose of trying the light, &c.,\r\nfor which the ring and satellites are good tests. The instruments\r\nwhich were employed in the present investigations were two Newtonian\r\nReflectors--one by Watson, of 40 inches focus and 6-1/4 aperture; and\r\nanother by Dollond, of 68 inches focus, and 6-3/4 aperture. The first,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, gave a most excellent image, the latter\r\nis a very good instrument. The following are extracts from the author’s\r\njournal.\r\n\r\n_Nov. 25, 1825._--The double ring beautifully defined, perfectly\r\ndistinct all around, and the principal belts well seen. I tried many\r\nconcave glasses, and found that the image was much sharper than with\r\nconvex eye-glasses, and the light apparently much greater. Dollond,\r\n259, the best power, 480, a single lens, very distinct. _Nov. 30_, the\r\nnight very favourable, but not equal to the 25th. The exterior ring\r\nof Saturn is not so bright as the interior, and the interior is less\r\nbright close to the edge next the planet. The inner edge appears more\r\nyellow than the rest of the ring, and nearer in colour to the body\r\nof the planet. _Dec. 17_.--The evening extremely fine. With Dollond,\r\nI perceived the outer ring of Saturn to be darker than the inner,\r\nand the division of the ring all around with perfect distinctness;\r\nbut with Watson I fancied that I saw _the outer ring separated by\r\nnumerous dark divisions extremely close, one stronger than the rest,\r\ndividing the ring about equally_. This was seen with my most perfect\r\nsingle eye-glass power. A careful examination of some hours confirmed\r\nthis opinion.--_Jan. 16_ and 17, 1826.--Captain Kater believed that\r\nhe saw the divisions with the Dollond, but was not positive. Concave\r\neye-glasses found to be superior to convex. _Feb. 26, 1826_.--The\r\ndivision of the outer ring not seen with Dollond. On the 17th Dec.,\r\nwhen the divisions were most distinctly seen, Captain Kater made a\r\ndrawing of the appearance of Saturn and his rings. The phenomena\r\nwere witnessed by two other persons on the same evening, one of whom\r\nsaw several divisions in the outer ring, while the other saw one\r\nmiddle division only; but the latter person was short-sighted, and\r\nunaccustomed to telescopic observations. It may be remarked, however,\r\nthat these divisions were not seen on other evenings, which yet were\r\nconsidered very favourable for distinct vision.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the same appearances were seen by Mr. Short, but the\r\noriginal record of his observations cannot be found. In Lalande’s\r\n_Astronomy_ (3rd edition, article 3351,) it is said, ‘Cassini remarked\r\nthat the breadth of the ring was divided into two equal parts by a\r\ndark line having the same curvature as the ring, and the _exterior_\r\nportion was the less bright. Short _told_ me that he observed still\r\nmore singular phenomena with his large telescope of 12 feet. The\r\nbreadth of the ansæ, or extremities of the ring; was, according to him,\r\ndivided into two parts,--an inner portion without any break in the\r\nillumination, and an outer divided by several lines concentric with the\r\ncircumference; which would lead to a belief, _that there are several\r\nrings in the same plane_.’ De Lambre and Birt severally state that\r\nShort saw the outer ring divided, probably on the authority of Lalande.\r\nIn Brewster’s _Ferguson’s Astronomy_, vol. ii, p. 125, 2nd edition,\r\nthere is the following note on this subject. ‘Mr. Short assures us,\r\nthat with an excellent telescope, he observed the surface of the ring\r\ndivided by several dark concentric lines, which seem to indicate a\r\nnumber of rings proportional to the number of dark lines which he\r\nperceived.’\r\n\r\nIn Dec. 1813, at Paris, Professor Quetelet saw the outer ring divided\r\nwith the achromatic telescope of 10 inches aperture, which was\r\nexhibited at the exposition. He mentioned this the following day to M.\r\nde la Place, who observed, that ‘those or even more divisions, were\r\nconformable to the system of the world.’ On the other hand the division\r\nof the outer ring was not seen by Sir W. Herschel in 1792, nor by Sir\r\nJ. Herschel in 1826, nor by Struve in the same year; and on several\r\noccasions when the atmospheric conditions were most favourable, it\r\nhas not been seen by Captain Kater. It has been remarked by Sir W.\r\nHerschel, Struve and others, that the exterior ring is much less\r\nbrilliant than the interior. And it is asked, may not this want of\r\nlight in the outer ring arise from its having a very dense atmosphere?\r\nand may not this atmosphere in certain states admit of the divisions\r\nof the exterior ring being seen, though, under other circumstances,\r\nthey remain invisible? The above observations are said to have been\r\nconfirmed by some recent observations by Decuppis at Rome, who\r\nannounced, some years ago, that Saturn’s outer ring is divided into two\r\nor three concentric rings.\r\n\r\nSome of the observations stated above, were they perfectly correct,\r\nwould lead to the conclusion that Saturn is encompassed with a number\r\nof rings, concentric with and parallel to each other. But while such\r\nphenomena as described above are so seldom seen, even by the most\r\npowerful telescopes and the most accurate observers, a certain degree\r\nof doubt must still hang over the subject; and we must suspend our\r\nopinion on this point, till future observations shall either confirm\r\nor render doubtful those to which we have referred. Should the Earl\r\nof Rosse’s great telescope, when finished for observation, be found\r\nto perform according to the expectations now entertained, and in\r\nproportion to its size and quantity of light, we shall expect that our\r\ndoubts will be resolved in regard to the supposed divisions of the ring\r\nof Saturn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EARL OF ROSSE’S TELESCOPE.\r\n\r\nThis telescope, the largest and most magnificent that ever was\r\nattempted, reflects the greatest honour on the genius, the inventive\r\npowers, and the scientific acquirements of its noble contriver, as\r\nwell as on the elevated station in which he is placed. With rank and\r\nfortune, and every circumstance that usually unfit men for scientific\r\npursuit, he has set a bright example to his compeers of the dignity and\r\nutility of philosophical studies and investigations, and of the aids\r\nthey might render to the progress of science, were their wealth and\r\npursuits directed in a proper channel.\r\n\r\nPreviously to his Lordship’s attempting the construction of his\r\nlargest--or ‘Monster Telescope,’ he had constructed one with a speculum\r\nof 3 feet in diameter, which was considered one of the most accurate\r\nand powerful instruments that had ever been made, not excepting even\r\nSir W. Herschel’s forty-feet Reflector. In the account of this\r\ntelescope, published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1840,\r\nhis Lordship speaks of the possibility of a speculum of six feet in\r\ndiameter being cast. At that time, it was considered by some as little\r\nshort of a chimera to attempt the construction of such a monstrous\r\ninstrument. But the idea no sooner occurred to this ingenious and\r\npersevering nobleman than he determined to put it to the test, and the\r\nresult has been attended with complete success. The materials of which\r\nthis speculum is composed are _copper_ and _tin_, united very nearly\r\nin their atomic proportions, namely, copper 126.4 parts, to tin 58.9\r\nparts. This compound has a specific gravity of 8.8, and it is found to\r\npreserve its lustre with more splendor, and to be more free from pores\r\nthan any other. A foundry was constructed expressly for the purpose of\r\ncasting the speculum. Its chimney built from the ground was 18 feet\r\nhigh, and 16-1/2 square at the base, tapering to four at the top. At\r\neach of its sides, communicating with it by flue, was sunk a furnace\r\n8 feet deep, and 5-1/2 square, with a circular opening 4 feet in\r\ndiameter. About seven feet from the chimney was erected a large crane,\r\nwith the necessary tackle for elevating and carrying the crucibles from\r\nthe furnace to the mould, which was placed in a line with the chimney\r\nand crane, and had three iron baskets supported on pivots hung round\r\nit; and four feet farther on was the annealing oven. The crucibles\r\nwhich contained the metal were each 2 feet in diameter, 2-1/2 deep,\r\nand together weighed one ton and a half; they were of cast iron and\r\nmade to fit the baskets at the side of the mould. These baskets were\r\nhung on wooden uprights or pivots, to one of these on each side was\r\nattached a lever, by depressing which it might be turned over, and\r\nthe contents of the crucible poured into the mould. The bottom of the\r\nmould was made by binding together tightly layers of hoop-iron, and\r\nturning the required shape on them edgewise. This mould conducted the\r\nheat away through the bottom, and cooled the metal towards the top in\r\ninfinitely small layers, while the interstices, though close enough to\r\nprevent the metal from escaping, were sufficiently open to allow the\r\nair to penetrate. This bottom was six feet in diameter and 5-1/2 inches\r\nthick, and was made perfectly horizontal by means of spirit levels, and\r\nwas surrounded by a wooden frame; a wooden pattern, the exact size of\r\nthe speculum, being placed on the iron; sand was well packed between\r\nit and the frame, and the pattern was removed. Each of the crucibles\r\ncontaining the melted metal was then placed in its basket, and every\r\nthing being ready for discharging their contents, they were at the same\r\ninstant turned over, and the mould being filled, the metal in a short\r\ntime safely set into the required figure. Whilst it was red hot, and\r\nscarcely solid, the frame-work was removed, and an iron ring connected\r\nwith a bar which passed through the oven, being placed round it, it\r\nwas drawn in by means of a capstan at the other side, on a railroad,\r\nwhen charcoal being lighted in the oven, and turf fires underneath\r\nit, all the openings were built up, and it was left for sixteen weeks\r\nto anneal. It was cast on the 13th of April, 1842, at 9 o’clock in\r\nthe evening. The crucibles were ten hours heating in the furnaces\r\nbefore the metal was introduced, which in about ten hours more was\r\nsufficiently fluid to be poured. When the oven was opened the speculum\r\nwas found as perfect as when it entered it. It was then removed to the\r\ngrinding machine, where it underwent that process, and afterwards was\r\npolished, without any accident having occurred.\r\n\r\nThis speculum weighed _three tons_, and lost about one eighth of\r\nan inch in grinding. Lord Rosse has since cast another speculum of\r\nthe same diameter four tons in weight. He can now, with perfect\r\nconfidence, undertake any casting, so great an improvement has the\r\nform of mould which he has invented proved. The speculum was placed\r\non an equilibrium bed, composed of nine pieces resting on points at\r\ntheir centres of gravity; the pieces were lined with pitch and felt,\r\nbefore the speculum was placed on them. The speculum box is also lined\r\nwith felt and pitched; this prevents any sudden change of temperature\r\naffecting the speculum by means of the bad conducting power of the\r\nsubstances employed. A vessel of lime is kept in connection with the\r\nspeculum-box to absorb the moisture, which otherwise might injure the\r\nmirror. The process of grinding was conducted under water, and the\r\nmoving power employed was a steam-engine of three-horse power. The\r\nPolisher is connected with the machinery by means of a large ring of\r\niron, which loosely encircles it; and instead of either the speculum\r\nor the polisher being stationary, both move with a regulated speed;\r\nthe ring of the polisher, and therefore the polisher itself, has a\r\ntransverse and a longitudinal motion; it makes 80 strokes in the\r\nminute, and 24-1/2 strokes backward and forward for every revolution\r\nof the mirror, and at the same time 1-72/100 strokes in the transverse\r\ndirection. The extent of the latter is 27/100 of the diameter of the\r\nspeculum. The substance made use of to wear down the surface was emery\r\nand water, a constant supply of these was kept between the grinder\r\nand the speculum. The Grinder is made of cast iron, with grooves\r\ncut lengthways, across and circularly on its face. The polisher and\r\nspeculum have a mutual action upon each other; in a few hours, by the\r\nhelp of the emery and water, they are both ground truly circular,\r\nwhatever may have been their previous defects. The grinding is\r\ncontinued till the required form of surface is produced; and this is\r\nascertained in the following manner. There is a high tower over the\r\nhouse in which the speculum is ground, on the top of which is fixed a\r\npole, to which is attached the dial of a watch; there are trap doors\r\nwhich open, and by means of a temporary eye-piece, allow the figure\r\nof the dial to be seen in the speculum brought to a slight polish. If\r\nthe dots on the dial are not sufficiently well-defined, the grinding\r\nis continued; but if they appear satisfactorily, the polishing is\r\ncommenced. It required six weeks to grind it to a fair surface. The\r\npolisher was cut into grooves, to prevent the abraded matter from\r\naccumulating in some places more than in others--a thin layer of pitch\r\nwas spread over it, it was smeared over with rouge and water, and a\r\nsupply of it kept up till the machinery brought it to a fine black\r\npolish. The length of time employed for polishing the 3 feet speculum\r\nwas six hours.[48]\r\n\r\nThis large telescope is now completed, or nearly so. The tube is 56\r\nfeet long, including the speculum box, and is made of deal, one inch\r\nthick, hooped with iron. On the inside, at intervals of 8 feet, there\r\nare rings of iron 3 inches in depth and 1 inch broad, for the purpose\r\nof strengthening the sides. The diameter of the tube is 7 feet. It is\r\nfixed to mason-work, in the ground, to a large universal hinge which\r\nallows it to turn in all directions. At 12 feet distance, on each side,\r\na wall is built, 72 feet long, 48 high on the outer side, and 56 on\r\nthe inner--the walls being 24 feet distant from each other, and lying\r\nexactly in the meridional line. When directed to the south, the tube\r\nmay be lowered till it become almost horizontal; but when pointed to\r\nthe north, it only falls till it is parallel with the earth’s axis,\r\npointing then to the pole of the heavens. Its lateral movements take\r\nplace only from wall to wall, and this commands a view for half an hour\r\non each side of the meridian--that is, the whole of its motion from\r\neast to west is limited to 15 degrees. At present it is fitted up in a\r\ntemporary way to be used as a Transit instrument; but it is ultimately\r\nintended to connect with the tube-end galleries, machinery which shall\r\ngive an automaton movement, so that the telescope shall be used as an\r\nEquatorial Instrument. All the works connected with this instrument\r\nare of the strongest and safest kind; all the iron-work was cast in\r\nhis Lordship’s laboratory by men instructed by himself, and every part\r\nof the machinery was made under his own eye, by the artizans in his\r\nown neighbourhood, and not a single accident worth mentioning happened\r\nduring the whole proceeding.\r\n\r\nThe expence incurred by his Lordship in the erection of this noble\r\ninstrument was not less than _twelve thousand pounds_! besides the\r\nmoney expended in the construction of the telescope of three feet\r\ndiameter. Sufficient time has not yet been afforded for making\r\nparticular observations with this telescope; but from slight trials\r\nwhich have been made, even under unfavourable circumstances, it\r\npromises important results. Its great superiority over every telescope\r\npreviously constructed consists in the great quantity of light it\r\nreflects, and the brilliancy with which it exhibits objects even when\r\nhigh powers are applied. It has a reflecting surface of 4,071 square\r\ninches, while that of Herschel’s 40-feet telescope had only 1811 square\r\ninches on its polished surface, so that the quantity of light reflected\r\nfrom the speculum is considerably more than double that of Herschel’s\r\nlargest reflector. This instrument has already exceeded his Lordship’s\r\nexpectations. Many appearances before invisible in the Moon, have been\r\nperceived, and there is every reason to expect that new discoveries\r\nwill be made by it in the _Nebulæ_, double and triple stars, and other\r\ncelestial objects. The following is an extract of a communication\r\nfrom Sir James South, on this subject, addressed to the Editor of the\r\n‘_Times_.’ ‘The leviathan telescope on which the Earl of Rosse has\r\nbeen toiling upwards of two years, although not absolutely finished,\r\nwas on Wednesday last directed to the Sidereal Heavens. The letter\r\nwhich I have this morning received from its noble maker, in his usual\r\nunassuming stile, merely states, that the metal only just polished,\r\nwas of a pretty good figure, and that with a power of 500, the nebula\r\nknown as No. 2., of Messier’s catalogue, was even more magnificent than\r\nthe nebula, No. 13 of Messier, when seen with his Lordship’s telescope\r\nof 3 feet diameter, and 27 feet focus. Cloudy weather prevented him\r\nfrom turning the leviathan on any other nebulous object. Thus, then,\r\nwe have all danger of the metal breaking before it could be polished,\r\novercome. Little more, however, will be done with it for some time, as\r\nthe Earl is on the eve of quitting Ireland for England to resign his\r\npost at York as President of the British Association. I look forward\r\nwith intense anxiety to witness its first severe trial, when all its\r\nvarious appointments shall be completed, in the confidence that those\r\nwho may then be present, will see with it what man has never seen\r\nbefore. The diameter of the large metal is 6-feet, and its focus 54\r\nfeet; yet the immense mass is manageable by one man. Compared with\r\nit, the working telescopes of Sir William Herschel, which in his\r\nhands conferred on astronomy such inestimable service, and on himself\r\nastronomical immortality, were but playthings.’\r\n\r\nThe following is a more recent account of observations made by this\r\ntelescope, chiefly extracted from Sir James South’s description of\r\nthis telescope, inserted in the _Times_ of April 16th, 1845, and the\r\n‘_Illustrated London News_’ of April 19.\r\n\r\n‘The night of the 5th of March, 1845, was the finest I ever saw in\r\nIreland. Many nebulæ were observed by Lord Rosse, Dr. Robinson and\r\nmyself. Most of them were for the first time since their creation,\r\nseen by us as groups or clusters of stars; while some, at least to\r\nmy eyes, showed no such resolution. Never, however, in my life did\r\nI see such glorious sidereal pictures as this instrument afforded\r\nus. Most of the nebulæ we saw I certainly have observed with my own\r\nlarge achromatic; but although that instrument, as far as relates to\r\nmagnifying power, is probably inferior to no one in existence, yet to\r\ncompare these nebulæ, as seen with it and the 6-feet telescope, is like\r\ncomparing, as seen with the naked eye, the dinginess of the planet\r\nSaturn to the brilliancy of Venus. The most popularly-known nebulæ\r\nobserved this night were the ring nebulæ in the _Canes Venatici_, or\r\nthe 51st of Messier’s catalogue, which was resolved into stars with a\r\nmagnifying power of 548, and the 94th of Messier, which is in the same\r\nconstellation, and which was resolved into a large globular cluster of\r\nstars, not much unlike the well-known cluster in Hercules, called also\r\n13th Messier.’ Perfection of figure, however, of a telescope, must be\r\ntested, not by nebulæ, but by its performance on a star of the first\r\nmagnitude. If it will, under high power, show the star round and free\r\nfrom optical appendages, we may safely take it for granted it will not\r\nonly show nebulæ well, but any other celestial object as it ought.\r\nTo determine this point, the telescope was directed to _Regulus_,\r\nwith the entire aperture, and a power of 800, and ‘I saw’ says Sir\r\nJames, ‘with inexpressible delight, the star free from wings, tails or\r\noptical appendages; not indeed like a planetary disk, as in my large\r\nachromatic, but as a round image resembling voltaic light between\r\ncharcoal points; and so little aberration had this brilliant image,\r\nthat I could have measured its distance from, and position with any of\r\nthe stars in the field with a spider’s line micrometer, and a power of\r\n1,000, without the slightest difficulty; for, not only was the large\r\nstar round, but the telescope, although in the open air, and the wind\r\nblowing rather fresh, was as steady as a rock.’\r\n\r\n‘On subsequent nights, observations of other nebulæ, amounting to some\r\n30 or more, removed most of them from the list of nebulæ, where they\r\nhad long figured, to that of clusters; while some of these latter, more\r\nespecially 5 Messier, exhibited a sidereal picture in the telescope\r\nsuch as man before had never seen, and which for its magnificence\r\nbaffles all description. Several double stars were seen with various\r\napertures of the telescope, and with powers between 360 and 800; and\r\nas the Earl had told us before we should,--before the speculum was\r\ninserted in the tube, in consequence of his having been obliged to quit\r\nthe superintendence of the polishing at the most critical part of the\r\nprocess,--we found that a ring of about 6 inches broad, reckoning from\r\nthe circumference of the speculum, was not perfectly polished, and to\r\n_that_ the little irradiation seen about Regulus was unquestionably\r\nreferable. The only double stars of the 1st class which the weather\r\npermitted us to examine with it were Xi Ursæ Majoris, and Gamma\r\nVirginis, which I could have measured with the greatest confidence.\r\nD’Arrest’s comet we observed on the 12th of March, with a power of\r\n400, but nothing worthy of notice was detected. Of the Moon, a few\r\nwords must suffice. Its appearance in my large achromatic of 12 inches\r\naperture is known to hundreds of readers; let them then imagine that\r\nwith it they look _at_ the moon, whilst with Lord Rosse’s 6 feet they\r\nlook _into it_, and they will not form a very erroneous opinion of\r\nthe performance of the Leviathan. On the 15th of March, when the moon\r\nwas 7 days old, I never saw her unilluminated disk so beautifully,\r\nnor her mountains so temptingly measurable. On my first looking into\r\nthe telescope, a star of about the 7th magnitude was some minutes of\r\na degree from the moon’s dark limb, and its occultation by the moon\r\nappeared inevitable. The star, however, instead of disappearing the\r\nmoment the moon’s edge came in contact with it, apparently glided on\r\nthe moon’s dark face, as if it had been seen through a transparent\r\nmoon, or as if the star were between me and the moon. It remained on\r\nthe moon’s disk nearly two seconds of time, and then disappeared. I\r\nhave seen this apparent projection of a star on the moon’s face several\r\ntimes, but from the great brilliancy of the star, this was the most\r\nbeautiful I ever saw. The cause of this phenomenon is involved in\r\nimpenetrable mystery.’\r\n\r\nThe following is a representation of the Great Rosse Telescope, along\r\nwith part of the buildings with which it is connected. In the interior\r\nface of the eastern wall a very strong iron arc of about 43 feet radius\r\nis firmly fixed, provided with adjustments, whereby its surface facing\r\nthe telescope may be set very accurately in the plane of the meridian.\r\nOn this bar, lines are drawn, the interval between any adjoining two of\r\nwhich, corresponds to one minute of time on the Equator. The tube and\r\nspeculum, including the bed on which the speculum rests, weigh about\r\n15 tons. The telescope rests on an universal joint placed on masonry\r\nabout 6 feet below the ground, and is elevated or depressed by a chain\r\nand windlass; and although it weighs about 15 tons, the instrument is\r\nraised by two men with great facility. Of course, it is counterpoised\r\nin every direction. The observer when at work, stands in one of four\r\ngalleries, the three highest of which are drawn out from the western\r\nwall, while the fourth or lowest has for its base an elevating\r\nplatform, along the horizontal surface of which a gallery slides from\r\nwall to wall by a machinery within the observer’s reach, but which\r\na child may work. When the telescope is about half an hour east of\r\nthe meridian, the galleries, hanging over the gap between the walls,\r\npresent to a spectator below an appearance somewhat dangerous; yet the\r\nobserver, with common prudence, is as safe as on the ground, and each\r\nof the galleries can be drawn from the wall to the telescope’s side so\r\nreadily, that the observer needs no one else to move it for him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 98._]\r\n\r\nThe above figure represents only the upper part of the tube of the\r\ntelescope, at which the observer stands when making his observations.\r\nThe telescope is at present of the Newtonian construction, and\r\nconsequently, the observer looks into the side of the tube at the upper\r\nend of the telescope, but it is proposed to throw aside the plane\r\nspeculum, and to adapt it to the _Front view_, on the plan already\r\ndescribed (see pp. 306, 313, &c.) so that the observer will sit or\r\nstand with his back towards the object, and his face looking down upon\r\nthe speculum; and, in this position, he will sometimes be elevated\r\nbetween 50 and 60 feet above the ground. As yet, the telescope has no\r\nequatorial motion, but it very shortly will; and at no very distant\r\nday, clock-work will be connected with it, when the observer will,\r\nwhile observing, be almost as comfortable, as if he were reading at a\r\ndesk by his fire-side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _figure 99._]\r\n\r\nThe following figure shews a section of the machinery connected with\r\nthis telescope. It exhibits a view of the inside of the eastern wall,\r\nwith all the machinery as seen in section. A is the mason-work on the\r\nground, B the universal joint, which allows the tube to turn in all\r\ndirections; C the speculum in its tube; D the box; E the eye-piece; F\r\nthe moveable pulley; G the fixed one; H the chain from the side of the\r\ntube; I the chain from the beam; K the counterpoise; L the lever; M\r\nthe chain connecting it with the tube; Z the chain which passes from\r\nthe tube to the windlass over a pulley on a truss-beam which runs from\r\nW to the same situation on the opposite wall--the pulley is not seen.\r\nX is a railroad on which the speculum is drawn either to or from its\r\nbox; part is cut away to show the counterpoise. The dotted line _a_\r\nrepresents the course of the weight R as the tube rises or falls; it\r\nis a segment of a circle of which the chain I is the radius. The tube\r\nis moved from wall to wall by the ratchet and wheel at R; the wheel is\r\nturned by the handle O, and the ratchet is fixed to the circle on the\r\nwall. The ladders in front, as shown in the preceding sketch, enable\r\nthe observer to follow the tube in its ascent to where the galleries on\r\nthe side wall commence; these side galleries are three in number, and\r\neach can be moved from wall to wall by the observer, after the tube,\r\nthe motion of which he also accomplishes by means of the handle O.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude the description of this wonderful instrument in the\r\nwords of Sir James South.\r\n\r\n‘What will be the power of this telescope when it has its Le Mairean\r\nform’ [that is, when it is fitted up with the front view] ‘it is not\r\neasy to divine;--what nebulæ will it resolve into stars; in what nebulæ\r\nwill it not find stars;--how many satellites of Saturn will it show\r\nus;--how many will it indicate as appertaining to Uranus;--how many\r\nnebulæ never yet seen by mortal eye, will it present to us;--what spots\r\nwill it show us on the various planets; will it tell us what causes\r\nthe variable brightness of many of the fixed stars;--will it give us\r\nany information as to the constitution of the planetary nebulæ;--will\r\nit exhibit to us any satellites encircling them; will it tell us\r\nwhy the satellites of Jupiter, which generally pass over Jupiter’s\r\nface as disks nearly of white light, sometimes traverse it as black\r\npatches;--will it add to our knowledge of the physical construction of\r\nnebulous stars;--of that mysterious class of bodies which surround\r\nsome stars, called, for want of a better name, ‘photospheres;’--will\r\nit show the annular nebulæ of Lyra, merely as a brilliant luminous\r\nring, or will it exhibit it as thousands of stars arranged in all the\r\nsymmetry of an ellipse; will it enable us to comprehend the hitherto\r\nincomprehensible nature and origin of the light of the great nebulæ\r\nof Orion;--will it give us, in easily appreciable quantity, the\r\nparallax of some of the fixed stars, or will it make sensible to us\r\nthe parallax of the nebulae themselves;--finally, having presented to\r\nus original portraits of the moon and of the sidereal heavens, such as\r\nman has never dared even to anticipate--will it, by Daguerreotype aid,\r\nadminister to us copies founded upon truth, and enable astronomers of\r\nfuture ages to compare the moon and heavens as they then may be, with\r\nthe moon and heavens as they were? Some of these questions will be\r\nanswered affirmatively, others negatively, and that, too, very shortly;\r\nfor the noble maker of the noblest instrument ever formed by man, “has\r\ncast his bread upon the waters, and will, with God’s blessing, find it\r\nbefore many days.”’\r\n\r\n\r\nHINTS TO AMATEURS IN ASTRONOMY RESPECTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF\r\nTELESCOPES.\r\n\r\nAs there are many among the lower ranks of the community who have a\r\ndesire to be possessed of a telescope, which will show them some of the\r\nprominent features of celestial scenery, but who are unable to purchase\r\na finished instrument at the prices usually charged by Opticians, the\r\nfollowing hints may perhaps be acceptable to those who are possessed of\r\na mechanical genius.\r\n\r\nThe lenses of an Achromatic telescope may be purchased separately\r\nfrom glass-grinders or Opticians, and tubes of a cheap material may\r\nbe prepared by the individual himself for receiving the glasses.\r\nThe following are the prices at which achromatic object-glasses for\r\nastronomical telescopes are generally sold. Focal length 30 inches,\r\ndiameter 2-1/4 inches, from 2 to 3-1/2 guineas. Focal length 42 inches,\r\ndiameter 2-3/4 inches, from 5 to 8 guineas. Focal length 42 inches,\r\ndiameter 3-1/4 inches, from 12 to 20 guineas. Focal length 42 inches,\r\ndiameter 3-3/4 inches, from 25 to 30 guineas. Eye-pieces, from 10s. 6d.\r\nto 18 shillings. The smallest of these lenses, namely that of 2-1/4\r\ninches diameter, if truly achromatic, may be made to bear a power of\r\nfrom 80 to 100 times, in clear weather, for celestial objects, which\r\nwill show Jupiter’s moons and belts, Saturn’s ring and other celestial\r\nphenomena. The tubes may be made either of tin plates, _papier maché_,\r\nor wood. Wood, however, is rather a clumsy article, and it is sometimes\r\nliable to warp, yet excellent tubes have sometimes been made of it.\r\nPerhaps the cheapest and most convenient of all tubes when properly\r\nmade, are those formed of paper. In forming these a wooden roller of\r\nthe proper diameter should be procured, and paper of a proper size,\r\nalong with book-binder’s paste. About three or four layers only of the\r\npaper should be pasted at one time, and, when sufficiently dry, it\r\nshould be smoothed by rubbing it with a smooth stick or ruler; after\r\nwhich another series of layers should be pasted on, and allowed to dry\r\nas before, and so on till the tube has acquired a sufficient degree\r\nof strength and firmness. In this way, I have, by means of a few old\r\nNewspapers, and similar materials, formed tubes as strong as if they\r\nhad been made of wood. If several tubes be intended to slide into each\r\nother, the smallest tube should be made first, and it will serve as a\r\nroller for forming the tube into which it is to slide.\r\n\r\nAn achromatic object glass of a shorter focal distance, and a smaller\r\ndiameter than any of those stated above, may be fitted up as a useful\r\nastronomical telescope, when a better instrument cannot be procured. In\r\nthe Pawn-broker’s shops in London, and other places, an old achromatic\r\ntelescope, with an object-glass 20 inches focal distance and about\r\n1-1/2 inch diameter, may be purchased at a price varying from 15 to 20\r\nshillings. By applying an astronomical eye-piece to such a lens, if\r\na good one, it may bear a power, for celestial objects, of 50 or 60\r\ntimes. If two plano-convex glasses, 3/4 inch focal distance, be placed\r\nwith their convex sides near to each other, they will form an eye-piece\r\nwhich will produce a power on such an object-glass, of above 50 times,\r\nwhich will show Jupiter’s belts and satellites, Saturn’s ring, the\r\nsolar spots, and the mountains and cavities of the moon. I have an\r\nobject-glass of this description which belonged to an old telescope,\r\nwhich cost me only 12 shillings, and with which I formerly made some\r\nuseful astronomical observations. It was afterwards used as the\r\ntelescope of a small Equatorial instrument, and, with it, I was enabled\r\nto perceive stars of the first and second magnitude, and the planets\r\nVenus, Jupiter, and Mars, in _the day-time_.\r\n\r\nBut, should such a glass be still beyond the reach of the astronomical\r\namateur, let him not altogether despair. He may purchase a single lens,\r\n3 feet focal distance, for about a couple of shillings, and by applying\r\nan eye-glass of 1 inch focus, which may be procured for a shilling, he\r\nwill obtain a power of 36 times, which is a higher power than Galileo\r\nwas able to apply to his best telescope; and consequently, with such an\r\ninstrument, he will be enabled to perceive all the celestial objects\r\nwhich that celebrated astronomer first described, and which excited so\r\nmuch wonder, at that period, in the learned world. But, whatever kind\r\nof telescope may be used, it is essentially requisite that it be placed\r\non a firm stand in all celestial observations: and any common mechanic\r\ncan easily form such a stand at a trifling expence.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain optical illusion to which most persons are subject,\r\nin the first use of telescopes, especially when applied to the\r\ncelestial bodies, on which it may not be improper to make a remark.\r\nThe illusion to which I allude is this--that they are apt to imagine,\r\nthe telescope does not magnify nearly so much as it really does. They\r\nare apt to complain of the small appearance which Jupiter and Saturn,\r\nfor example, present when magnified 160 or 200 times. With such powers\r\nthey are apt to imagine, that these bodies do not appear so large as\r\nthe moon to the naked eye. Yet it can be proved that Jupiter, when\r\nnearest the earth, viewed with such a power, appears about 5 times\r\nthe diameter of the full moon, and 25 times larger in surface. This\r\nappears from the following calculation. Jupiter, when in opposition,\r\nor nearest the Earth, presents a diameter of 47´´: the mean apparent\r\ndiameter of the moon is about 31´. Multiply the diameter of Jupiter by\r\nthe magnifying power, 200, the product is 9400´´ or 156´ or 2° 36´,\r\nwhich, divided by 31´, the moon’s diameter, produces a quotient of 5,\r\nshowing that this planet with such a power appears five times larger in\r\ndiameter than the full moon to the naked eye, and consequently 25 times\r\nlarger in surface. Were a power of only 50 times applied to Jupiter,\r\nwhen nearest the earth, that planet would appear somewhat larger than\r\nthe full moon. For 47´´ multiplied by 50 gives 2350´´ or 39´, which\r\nis 8´ more than the diameter of the moon. Yet with such a power most\r\npersons would imagine that the planet does not appear one third of the\r\nsize of the full moon.\r\n\r\nThe principal mode by which a person may be experimentally convinced\r\nof the fallacy to which I allude is the following:--At a time when\r\nJupiter happens to be within a few degrees of the moon, let the planet\r\nbe viewed through the telescope with the one eye, and the magnified\r\nimage of the planet be brought into contact with the moon as seen with\r\nthe other eye--the one eye looking at the moon, and the other viewing\r\nthe magnified image of Jupiter through the telescope when brought into\r\napparent contact with the moon--then it will be perceived, that with\r\na magnifying power of 50 the image of Jupiter will completely cover\r\nthe moon as seen by the naked eye;--and with a power of 200--when the\r\nmoon is made to appear in the centre of the magnified image of the\r\nplanet--it will be seen that Jupiter forms a large and broad circle\r\naround the moon, appearing at least 5 times greater than the diameter\r\nof the moon. This experiment may be varied as follows: Suppose a person\r\nto view the moon through a small telescope or opera-glass, magnifying\r\nthree times, he will be apt to imagine, at first sight, that she is not\r\nin the least magnified, but rather somewhat diminished. But let him\r\nbring the image as seen in the telescope in contact with the moon as\r\nseen with the naked eye, and he will plainly perceive the magnifying\r\npower, by the size of the image. It may be difficult in the first\r\ninstance to look, at the same time, at the magnified image and the real\r\nobject, but a few trials will render it easy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nL.

We learn from Fabricius,\r\nan Italian, that three young men, residing at Padua, having bought a\r\nlamb, and eaten part of it on Easter Day, 1592, several pieces of the\r\nremainder which they kept till the following day, shone like so many\r\ncandles when they were casually viewed in the dark. The astonishment of\r\nthe whole city was excited by this phenomenon, and a part of the flesh\r\nwas sent to Fabricius, who was Professor of anatomy, to be examined by\r\nhim. He observed, that those parts which were soft to the touch and\r\ntransparent in candle-light, were the most resplendent: and also that\r\nsome pieces of kid’s flesh which had happened to have lain in contact\r\nwith them were luminous, as well as the fingers and other parts of the\r\nbodies of those persons who touched them. Bartholin gives an account\r\nof a similar phenomenon, which happened at Montpelier in 1641. A poor\r\nwoman had bought a piece of flesh in the market, intending to make use\r\nof it the following day, but happening not to be able to sleep well\r\nthat night, and her bed and pantry being in the same room, she observed\r\nso much light come from the flesh as to illuminate all the place where\r\nit hung. We may judge of the terror and astonishment of the woman\r\nherself, when we find that a part of this luminous flesh was carried as\r\na very extraordinary curiosity to Henry, Duke of Conde, the Governor of\r\nthe place, who viewed it several hours with the greatest astonishment.\r\nThe light was as if gems had been scattered over the surface, and\r\ncontinued till the flesh began to putrify, when it vanished, which\r\nit was believed to do in the form of a cross. Hence the propriety of\r\ninstructing the mass of the community in the knowledge of the facts\r\nconnected with the material system, and the physical causes of the\r\nvarious phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\n[6] Memoires de la Soc. d’Aroncil, vol. ii.\r\n\r\n[7] By a _medium_, in optics, is meant the space in which a ray of\r\nlight moves, whether pure space, air, water, glass, diamond, or any\r\nother transparent substance through which the rays of light can pass in\r\nstraight lines.\r\n\r\n[8] Edinburgh Philosophical Journal for October 1819, p. 411.\r\n\r\n[9] This mode of finding the focus of a concave lens may be varied as\r\nfollows:--let the lens be covered with paper, having two small circular\r\nholes; and on the paper for receiving the light, describe also two\r\nsmall circles, but with their centres at twice the distance from each\r\nother of the centres of the circles. Then move the paper to and from,\r\ntill the middle of the sun’s light, coming through the holes, falls\r\nexactly on the middle of the circles; that distance of the paper from\r\nthe lens will be the focal length required.\r\n\r\n[10] Small glass mirrors for performing some of the experiments, and\r\nillustrating some of the principles above alluded to,--may be made of\r\nthe flattest kind of common watch glasses, by foliating or covering\r\nwith tin leaf and quicksilver the convex surfaces of such glasses.\r\nTheir focal distances will generally be from one to two inches. Such\r\nmirrors afford a very large and beautiful view of the eye, when held\r\nwithin their focal distance of that organ. Such mirrors will also serve\r\nthe purpose of reflecting light on the objects viewed by microscopes.\r\nLarger mirrors, of from four to eight inches diameter, may be had of\r\nthe optician at different prices varying from five to ten or fifteen\r\nshillings.\r\n\r\n[11] Nicholson’s Journal of Natural Philosophy, &c. 4to. series, p. 225.\r\n\r\n[12] There can be little doubt that some of the facts ascribed, in the\r\nwestern highlands of Scotland, to _second sight_, have been owing to\r\nthe unusual refraction of the atmosphere; as one of the peculiarities\r\nattributed to those who possessed this faculty was, that they were\r\nenabled to descry boats and snips, before they appeared in the horizon.\r\n\r\n[13] Fraunhofer was in the highest sense of the word, an _Optician_,\r\nan original discoverer in the most abstruse and delicate departments\r\nof this science--a competent mathematician, an admirable mechanist,\r\nand a man of a truly philosophical turn of mind. By his extraordinary\r\ntalents, he was soon raised from the lowest station in a manufacturing\r\nestablishment to the direction of the _optical_ department of the\r\nbusiness, in which he originally laboured as an ordinary workman.\r\nHe then applied the whole power of his mind to the perfection of\r\nthe achromatic telescope, the defects of which in reference to the\r\noptical properties of the materials used--he attempted to remedy; and\r\nby a series of admirable experiments, succeeded in giving to optical\r\ndeterminations, the precision of astronomical observations, surpassing,\r\nin this respect all who had gone before him, except perhaps, the\r\nillustrious Newton. It was in the course of these researches, that he\r\nwas led to the important discovery of the dark lines which occur in the\r\nsolar spectrum. His achromatic telescopes are scattered over Europe,\r\nand are the largest and best that have hitherto been constructed. He\r\ndied at Munich, at a premature age, in 1826; his death, it is said\r\nbeing accelerated by the unwholesome nature of the processes employed\r\nin his glass-house; leaving behind him a reputation rarely attained\r\nby one so young. His Memoir “On the refractive and dispersive power\r\nof different species of glass, in reference to the improvement of\r\nAchromatic telescopes, and an account of the lines on the spectrum,”\r\nwill be found in the “Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,” Vol. ix. pp.\r\n288-299, and Vol. x. pp. 26-40, for 1823-4.\r\n\r\n[14] Philosophical Transactions. Vol. 50. p. 294.\r\n\r\n[15] Ecclesiasticus xliii. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n[16] It is a question which has been frequently started--Whether there\r\nwas any rainbow before the flood? Some have conceived that the rainbow\r\nwas something of a _miraculous_ production, and that it was never\r\nseen before the flood. The equivocal sense of the word ‘set’ in our\r\ntranslation, has occasioned a mistaken impression of this kind. The\r\nHebrew word thus translated, signifies more properly ‘I do give,’ or\r\n‘I _appoint_.’ The whole passage in reference to this circumstance,\r\nliterally translated, runs thus;--“I appoint my bow which is in the\r\ncloud, that it may be for a sign or token of a covenant between me and\r\nthe earth; and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the\r\nearth, and the bow shall be seen in the cloud, that I will remember my\r\ncovenant that is between me and you,” &c. As the rainbow is produced\r\nby the immutable laws of refraction and reflection, as applied to the\r\nrays of the sun striking on drops of falling rain, the phenomenon must\r\nhave been occasionally exhibited from the beginning of the world:\r\nunless we suppose that there was no rain before the flood, and that the\r\nconstitution of things in the physical system was very different from\r\nwhat it is now. The passage affirms no more than that the rainbow was\r\n_then appointed_ to be a _symbol_ of the covenant between God and man,\r\nand although it may have been frequently seen before, it would serve\r\nthe purpose of a sign equally well, as if it had been miraculously\r\nformed for this purpose, and even better, as its frequent appearance,\r\naccording to natural laws, is a perpetual memorial to man of the divine\r\nfaithfulness and mercy.\r\n\r\n[17] Though Borellus mentions this circumstance, yet there is some\r\nreason to doubt the accuracy of this statement, as young Jansen appears\r\nto have been at that period, not more than six years old; so that it\r\nis more probable that Galileo was the first discoverer of Jupiter’s\r\nsatellites.\r\n\r\n[18] The reader may see an engraving of this instrument in the author’s\r\nwork entitled ‘the _Improvement of Society_.’--p. 209.\r\n\r\n[19] It is one of the properties of concave lenses to render convergent\r\nrays less convergent, and when placed as here supposed, to render them\r\nparallel; and it is parallel rays that produce distinct vision.\r\n\r\n[20] The word _aperture_ as applied to object-glasses, signifies the\r\nopening to let in the light, or that part of the object-glass which is\r\nleft uncovered. An object-glass may be 3 inches in diameter, but if one\r\ninch of this diameter be covered, its aperture is said to be only 2\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[21] An achromatic telescope is said to be in possession of Mr. Cooper,\r\nM.P. for Sligo, which is 26 feet long, and the diameter of the object\r\nglass 14 inches.\r\n\r\n[22] This telescope, which was made by Dollond, with a power of 240\r\ntimes, gives a beautiful view of the belts of Jupiter and the double\r\nring of Saturn, and with a power of 50, the stars in the milky way and\r\nsome of the nebulæ appear very numerous and brilliant. Its owner is a\r\ngentleman who unites science with Christianity.\r\n\r\n[23] For a more particular account of Dr. Blair’s instruments and\r\nexperiments, the reader is referred to his Dissertation on this subject\r\nin Vol. II. of the ‘Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,’\r\nwhich occupies 76 pages--or to Nicholson’s ‘Journal of Natural\r\nPhilosophy,’ &c. Quarto Series, Vol. I., April, September, 1797.\r\n\r\n[24] A more detailed account of the processes connected with the\r\nconstruction of this telescope, will be found in a paper presented\r\nto the Royal Society, in 1827, and published in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions of that Society, for 1828, and likewise another paper,\r\npublished in the Transactions for 1829.

She is in possession of a large Gregorian reflector, about 12\r\nfeet long, made by Mr. Short, and mounted on an Equatorial axis. It was\r\noriginally placed in a small observatory erected on the Calton hill,\r\nabout the year 1776, but for many years past it has been little used.\r\n\r\n[27] A particular account of the Earl of Rosse’s fifty-feet Reflector,\r\nwhich is now finished, is given in the _Appendix_.\r\n\r\n[28] Philosophical Transactions for 1800, Vol. XC. p. 80, &c.\r\n\r\n[29] In using telescopes within doors, care should generally be taken,\r\nthat there be no fires in the apartment where they are placed for\r\nobservation, and that the air within be nearly of the same temperature\r\nas the air of the surrounding atmosphere; for if the room be filled\r\nwith heated air, when the windows are opened, there will be a current\r\nof cold air rushing in, and of heated air rushing out, which will\r\nproduce such an undulation and tremulous motion, as will prevent any\r\ncelestial object from being distinctly seen.\r\n\r\n[30] The above directions and remarks are abridged with some\r\nalterations from Dr. Pearson’s “Introduction to Practical\r\nAstronomy.”--Vol. II.\r\n\r\n[31] Pearson’s “Practical Astronomy.”--Vol. II.\r\n\r\n[32] The mother-of-pearl dynameter may be purchased for about twelve\r\nshillings.

If this number be divided by 200, the supposed magnifying\r\npower of the telescope, the quotient is 4,530,000, which expresses\r\nthe distance in miles at which it enables us to contemplate this\r\nplanet. If this number be subtracted from 906,000,000, the remainder\r\nis 901,470,000, which expresses the number of miles from the earth at\r\nwhich we are supposed to view Saturn with such an instrument.\r\n\r\n[35] _Irish Transactions_, Vol. X. and Nicholson’s Philosophical\r\nJournal, Vol. XVI.\r\n\r\n[36] Brewster’s Appendix to ‘Ferguson’s Lectures.’\r\n\r\n[37] A particular description of the micrometers here enumerated,\r\nand several others, will be found in Dr. Pearson’s ‘Introduction to\r\nPractical Astronomy,’ Vol. II.\r\n\r\n[38] Adams’ Introduction to Practical Astronomy.\r\n\r\n[39] Or find the sun’s right ascension for the given day; substract\r\nthis from the star or planet’s right ascension, and the remainder\r\nis the approximate time of the star’s coming to the meridian. The\r\ndifference between this time and the time of observation, will then\r\ndetermine the point to which the telescope is to be directed.\r\n\r\n[40] The right ascensions, declinations, longitudes, &c., stated in\r\nthese memoranda--which were noted at the time of observation--are only\r\napproximations to the truth; perfect accuracy in these respects being\r\nof no importance in such observations. They are, however, in general,\r\nwithin a minute or two of the truth. The _times_ of the observations,\r\ntoo, are noted in reference--not to the _astronomical_, but to the\r\n_civil_ day. The astronomical day commences at 12 noon, and the hours\r\nare reckoned, without interruption, to the following noon. The civil\r\nday commences at 12 midnight.\r\n\r\n[41] This observation is inserted in the ‘Edinburgh Philosophical\r\nJournal’ for January, 1844.\r\n\r\n[42] The late Mr. Benjamin Martin, when describing the nature of the\r\nsolar telescope, in his ‘_Philosophia Britannica_,’ Vol. iii. p. 85,\r\ngives the following relation:--‘I cannot here omit to mention a very\r\n_unusual phenomenon_ that I observed about ten years ago in my darkened\r\nroom. The window looked towards the west, and the spire of Chichester\r\nCathedral was before it at the distance of 50 or 60 yards. I used very\r\noften to divert myself by observing the pleasant manner in which the\r\nsun passed behind the spire, and was eclipsed by it for sometime; for\r\nthe image of the sun and of the spire were very large, being made by a\r\nlens of 12 feet focal distance. And once as I observed the occultation\r\nof the sun behind the spire, just as the disk disappeared, I saw\r\nseveral small, bright, round bodies or balls running toward the sun\r\nfrom the dark part of the room, even to the distance of 20 inches.\r\nI observed their motion was a little irregular, but rectilinear,\r\nand seemed accelerated as they approached the sun. These luminous\r\nglobules appeared also on the other side of the spire, and preceded\r\nthe sun, running out into the dark room, sometimes more, sometimes\r\nless, together in the same manner as they followed the sun at its\r\noccultation. They appeared to be in general one-twentieth of an inch\r\nin diameter, and therefore, must be very large luminous globes in some\r\npart of the heavens, whose light was extinguished by that of the sun,\r\nso that they appeared not in open day light; but whether of the meteor\r\nkind, or what sort of bodies they might be, I could not conjecture.’\r\nProfessor Hansteen mentions, that when employed in measuring the zenith\r\ndistances of the pole star, he observed a somewhat similar phenomenon,\r\nwhich he described as ‘a luminous body which passed over the field of\r\nthe universal telescope--that its motion was neither perfectly equal\r\nnor rectilinear, but resembled very much the unequal and somewhat\r\nserpentine motion of an ascending rocket;’ and he concluded that it\r\nmust have been ‘a meteor’ or ‘shooting star’ descending from the higher\r\nregions of the atmosphere.[43]\r\n\r\nIn my frequent observations on Venus, to determine the nearest\r\npositions to the sun in which that planet could be seen, I had several\r\ntimes an opportunity of witnessing similar phenomena. I was not a\r\nlittle surprised, when searching for the planet, frequently to perceive\r\na body pass across the field of the telescope, apparently of the same\r\nsize as Venus, though sometimes larger and sometimes smaller, so that\r\nI frequently mistook that body for the planet, till its rapid motion\r\nundeceived me. In several instances _four_ or _five_ of these bodies\r\nappeared to cross the field of view, sometimes in a perpendicular, and,\r\nat other times in a horizontal direction. They appeared to be luminous\r\nbodies, somewhat resembling the appearance of a planet when viewed in\r\nthe day-time with a moderate magnifying power. Their motion was nearly\r\nrectilinear, but sometimes inclined to a waving or serpentine form, and\r\nthey appeared to move with considerable rapidity--the telescope being\r\nfurnished with a power of about 70 times. I was for a considerable\r\ntime at a loss what opinion to form of the nature of these bodies;\r\nbut having occasion to continue these observations almost every clear\r\nday for nearly a twelvemonth, I had frequent opportunities of viewing\r\nthis phenomenon in different aspects; and was at length enabled to\r\nform an opinion as to the cause of at least _some_ of the appearances\r\nwhich presented themselves. In several instances, the bodies alluded\r\nto appeared much larger than usual, and to move with a more rapid\r\nvelocity; in which case I could plainly perceive that they were nothing\r\nelse than _birds_ of different sizes, and apparently at different\r\ndistances, the convex surfaces of whose bodies, in certain positions,\r\nstrongly reflected the solar rays. In other instances, when they\r\nappeared smaller, their true shape was undistinguishable by reason of\r\ntheir motion and their distance.\r\n\r\nHaving inserted a few remarks on this subject, in No. XXV. of the\r\nEdinburgh Philosophical Journal for July, 1825, particularly in\r\nreference to Professor Hansteen’s opinion, that article came under the\r\nreview of M. Serres, Sub-Prefect of Embrun, in a paper inserted in the\r\n_Annales de Chemie_, for October, 1825, entitled, ‘Notices regarding\r\nfiery meteors seen during the day.’[44] In the discussion of this\r\nsubject, M. Serres admits that the light reflected very obliquely from\r\nthe feathers of a bird is capable of producing an effect similar to\r\nthat which I have now described; but that ‘the explanation ought not\r\nto be _generalized_.’ He remarks, that, while observing the sun at the\r\nrepeating circle, he frequently perceived, even through the coloured\r\nglass adapted to the eye-piece, large luminous points which traversed\r\nthe field of the telescope, and which appeared too well defined not to\r\nadmit them to be distant, and subtended too large angles to imagine\r\nthem birds. In illustration of this subject he states the following\r\nfacts. On the 7th September, 1820, after having observed for some time\r\nthe eclipse of the sun which happened on that day, he intended to take\r\na walk in the fields, and on crossing the town, he saw a numerous group\r\nof individuals of every age and sex, who had their eyes fixed in the\r\ndirection of the sun. Further on, he perceived another group having\r\ntheir eyes in like manner turned towards the sun. He questioned an\r\nintelligent artist who was among them to learn the object that fixed\r\nhis attention. He replied, ‘We are looking at the stars which are\r\ndetaching themselves from the sun.’ ‘You may look yourself; that will\r\nbe the shortest way to learn the fact.’ He looked, and saw, in fact,\r\nnot stars, but balls of fire of a diameter equal to the largest stars,\r\nwhich were projected in various directions from the upper hemisphere\r\nof the sun, with an incalculable velocity, and although this velocity\r\nof projection appeared the same in all, yet they did not all attain\r\nthe same distance. These globes were projected at unequal and pretty\r\nshort intervals. Several were often projected at once, but always\r\ndiverging from one another. Some of them described a right line, and\r\nwere extinguished in the distance; some described a parabolic line, and\r\nwere in like manner extinguished; others again, after having removed\r\nto a certain distance in a right line, retrograded upon the same line,\r\nand seemed to enter, still luminous, into the sun’s disk. The ground of\r\nthis magnificent picture was a sky blue, somewhat tinged with brown.\r\nSuch was his astonishment at the sight of so majestic a spectacle, that\r\nit was impossible for him to keep his eyes off it till it ceased, which\r\nhappened gradually as the eclipse wore off and the solar rays resumed\r\ntheir ordinary lustre. It was remarked by one of the crowd that ‘the\r\nsun projected most stars at the time when it was palest;’ and that the\r\ncircumstance which first excited attention to this phenomenon was that\r\nof a woman who cried out ‘Come here!--come and see the flames that are\r\nissuing from the sun!’\r\n\r\nI have stated the above facts because they may afterwards tend to throw\r\nlight upon certain objects or phenomena with which we are at present\r\nunacquainted. The phenomenon of ‘falling stars’ has of late years\r\nexcited considerable attention, and it seems now to be admitted, that,\r\nat least, certain species of these bodies descend from regions far\r\nbeyond the limits of our atmosphere. This may be pronounced as certain\r\nwith regard to the ‘November Meteors.’ May not some of the phenomena\r\ndescribed above, be connected with the fall of meteoric stones--the\r\nshowers of falling stars seen on the 12th and 13th of November, or\r\nother meteoric phenomena whose causes we have hitherto been unable to\r\nexplain? Or, may we conceive that certain celestial bodies, with whose\r\nnature and destination we are as yet unacquainted, may be revolving in\r\ndifferent courses in the regions around us--some of them opaque and\r\nothers luminous, and whose light is undistinguishable by reason of the\r\nsolar effulgence?\r\n\r\n[43] See Edinburgh Philosophical Journal, for April, 1825.
