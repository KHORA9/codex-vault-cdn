New materials, new\r\nprocesses, new commodities have followed the train of advancing\r\ncivilization and the ensuing multiplication and alteration of man’s\r\neconomic needs. Even where the demand for a certain material to\r\nfulfill a particular function has continued through the centuries,\r\nwidening knowledge of natural resources coupled with modern invention\r\nhas usually found some substitute cheaper, more efficient, and better\r\nadapted for the purpose in question. Not so with cork. Recognized by\r\nthe ancients as peculiarly suited for certain uses, time has vindicated\r\ntheir verdict; nothing has yet been discovered to supplant it in its\r\nwide sphere of usefulness.\r\n\r\nTheophrastus, Greek philosopher and writer on botany, who flourished\r\nin the fourth century before Christ, was evidently familiar with the\r\nmaterial, for he mentions the cork tree as being a native of the\r\nPyrenees. For decades before the time of Horace cork was used for\r\nstoppers for wine vessels. In fact, the poet tells one of his friends,\r\nabout 25 B. C., that on the occasion of a coming anniversary banquet\r\nhe expects to “remove the cork sealed with pitch” from a jar of the\r\nrare vintage of forty-six years previous, the first but not the last\r\nproceeding of this character of which history makes record.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nGnarled Trunk of an Old Cork Oak]\r\n\r\nIt remained for the elder Pliny, however, in his wonderful work on\r\nnatural history, written in the first century of the Christian era,\r\nto make the most remarkable reference to cork to be found in ancient\r\nliterature: “The cork oak is but a very small tree and its acorns of\r\nthe very worst quality * * *; the bark is its only useful product,\r\nbeing remarkably thick, and if removed will grow again * * *. This\r\nsubstance is employed more particularly attached as a buoy to the ropes\r\nof ships’ anchors and the drag-nets of fishermen; it is used also for\r\nthe bungs of casks and as a material for the winter shoes of women.”\r\nCork jackets--life-preservers--are mentioned by Plutarch. Thus five\r\nof the principal functions which cork fills in the world to-day were\r\nrecognized two thousand years ago. In the fifteenth century glass\r\nbottles were introduced, which gave such great impetus to its general\r\nuse that the real beginning of the cork industry may properly be said\r\nto date from that period. Some conception of its importance to-day may\r\nbe gathered from the fact that the importations of the United States of\r\ncrude and manufactured cork now aggregate almost $5,000,000 in value\r\nannually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Strippers’ Camp]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stripping the Trees]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nGathering the Bark]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Tree’s Foliage]\r\n\r\nThe word _cork_ is derived from the Latin _cortex_, meaning bark,\r\nand the study of its origin and manufacture leads at once to those\r\nromantic countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. Spain and Portugal\r\ndivide honors among the nations of the world so far as yield of raw\r\nmaterial is concerned, with perhaps the advantage leaning slightly to\r\nthe latter. The cork-producing territory covers practically the whole\r\nof Portugal, sweeps toward the east through the southern districts of\r\nSpain known as Andalusia and Estremadura, thence northeast, embracing\r\nthousands of acres of forests in Catalonia. Algeria, with Tunis,\r\nranks next in importance in yearly tribute of bark, southern France,\r\nincluding Corsica, following closely after. Italy, too, with the help\r\nof Sardinia and Sicily, continues to be quite a factor in meeting the\r\ndemand for the crude material, while across the Strait of Gibraltar\r\nthe sun-scorched forests of Morocco are as yet undeveloped. The\r\ntotal area covered by cork forests is estimated at from four to five\r\nmillion acres, while the annual production of bark is declared to be\r\nnot far from fifty thousand tons. Although no official statistics\r\nare obtainable, these figures approximate the truth. In Portugal and\r\nSpain, particularly in Catalonia, which is probably the greatest cork\r\nmanufacturing district in the world, a large portion of the corkwood\r\nproduced goes to supply domestic factories, where more and more\r\nmachinery is being introduced every year. With these exceptions,\r\nhowever, the major part of the yield is exported to the United States,\r\nEngland, France, Germany, Austria, Russia, Denmark, or Sweden, to be\r\nturned into finished form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPile of Bark in the Forest]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nWeighing Bark in the Forest]\r\n\r\nThe cork oak, known botanically as _Quercus suber_, attains a height of\r\nfrom twenty to sixty feet and measures sometimes as much as four feet\r\nin diameter. Its wide-spreading branches are rather closely covered\r\nwith small evergreen leaves, thick, glossy, slightly serrated, and\r\ndowny underneath. In April or May flowers of a yellowish color appear,\r\nsucceeded by acorns which ripen and fall to the ground in the late\r\nfall. Pliny evidently knew whereof he wrote, for the cork oak’s acorns\r\nare bitter and not at all pleasant to the taste. They form, however,\r\none of the forests’ chief sources of revenue, since, fed to swine, they\r\ngive a peculiarly piquant flavor to the meat, Spanish mountain hams\r\nbeing noted for their excellence. Unfortunately, the herds in foraging\r\nfor food destroy the young trees and thus do serious and permanent\r\ninjury by preventing new growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nVirgin Cork and Second Stripping Bark]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Bark, “Back” and “Belly”]\r\n\r\nThe “corkwood,” or cork of commerce, is the outer bark of the cork\r\noak. When it has attained a diameter of approximately five inches,\r\nor, to be more exact, measures forty centimeters in circumference\r\naccording to the Spanish governmental regulations, which the tree\r\ndoes usually by the time it is twenty years old, the virgin cork, as\r\nthe first stripping of bark is called, is removed. This virgin cork\r\nis so rough, coarse, and dense in texture that it is of very little\r\ncommercial value. Fortunately its removal does not kill the tree,\r\nbut, on the other hand, seems to promote further development, for the\r\ninner bark--the seat of the growing processes--undertakes at once the\r\nformation of a new covering of finer texture. Each year this, the\r\nreal skin, with its life-giving sap, forms two layers of cells--one\r\nwithin, increasing the diameter of the trunk; the other without, adding\r\nthickness to the sheathing of bark. After eight or ten years this is\r\nalso removed, and, while more valuable than the virgin cork, it is not\r\nas fine in quality as that of the third and subsequent strippings,\r\nwhich follow at regular intervals of about nine years. At the age of\r\nabout forty years the oak begins to yield its best bark, continuing\r\nproductive as a rule for almost a century, although cork trees several\r\nhundred years old are not unknown. Flourishing as it does in a hot,\r\nsemi-arid climate, there seems to be no reason why this valuable tree\r\nshould not be successfully introduced in the southern and southwestern\r\nsections of the United States; in fact, in the year 1858 the United\r\nStates Government took certain steps in this direction, and even went\r\nso far as to distribute seedlings to interested persons in several\r\nstates. The Civil War interfered, however, and the experiments were\r\nnever fully carried out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPreparing Bark for Carriage to the Boiling Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork under the Microscope]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBark arriving at a Boiling Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nThe Common Carrier]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nA Boiling Station]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nA Wagon Load of Bark]\r\n\r\nThe stripping generally takes place during July and August, and is a\r\nprocess which demands skill and care if injury to the tree is to be\r\navoided. In Algeria, the French strippers sometimes use crescent-shaped\r\nsaws; but under the usual Spanish method a hatchet with a long handle,\r\nwedge-shaped at the end, is the only implement employed. The bark is\r\ncut clear through around the base of the tree and a similar incision\r\nis made around the trunk just below the spring of the main branches;\r\nthe two incisions are then connected by one or two longitudinal cuts,\r\nfollowing so far as possible the deepest of the natural cracks in\r\nthe bark. Inserting the wedge-shaped handle, the tree’s covering is\r\nthen pried off, care being taken not to injure the inner skin at any\r\nstage of the process, for the life of the tree depends on its proper\r\npreservation; and if it is injured at any point, growth there ceases\r\nand the spot remains forever afterward scarred and uncovered. The\r\nlarger branches are stripped in the same manner, yielding thinner\r\nbut generally a finer grade of cork than that from the trunk. The\r\nthickness of the bark is anywhere from one-half to two and a half\r\ninches, while the yield also varies greatly--from forty-five to five\r\nhundred pounds--depending on the size and age of the tree. As the\r\nbark is removed it is gathered up in piles and left for a few days to\r\ndry. Having been weighed, it is next carried either in wagons or on\r\nthe backs of burros to the boiling stations, where it is stacked and\r\nallowed to season for a few weeks. It is then ready for the boiling\r\nprocess, which at times is postponed until the crude material reaches\r\nSeville or some other shipping point. But if the forest is distant, the\r\nwater supply adequate, and the quantity of bark ample to justify such\r\nprocedure, the vats are erected at a convenient spot and this operation\r\ncarried out on the ground. The outside of the bark in its natural\r\nstate is, as may well be imagined, rough and woody, owing to exposure\r\nto the weather. After boiling, this useless outer coating is readily\r\nscraped off, thereby reducing the weight of the material almost twenty\r\nper cent. The boiling process also serves to remove the tannic acid,\r\nincreases the volume and elasticity of the bark, renders it soft and\r\npliable, and flattens it out for convenient packing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nFactory at Seville, covering Twenty Acres]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTrimming the Sheets of Bark at Seville]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCorner of One of the Sorting Rooms at Seville]\r\n\r\nAfter being roughly sorted as to quality and thickness the bark is then\r\nready for its first long journey, and, as the forests are generally\r\nlocated in hilly or even mountainous country, the faithful burro must\r\nagain be called into service. Truly the Spaniard’s best friend, though\r\nthe worst treated of all, these patient little animals present a most\r\ngrotesque appearance when loaded from head to hind quarters with a\r\nhuge mass of the light bark. Down from the hills they go in trains of\r\nthirty, forty, or even a hundred, threading the rocky bridle paths in\r\nsingle file and wending their way through the narrow streets of quaint\r\nvillages, where traces of Moorish occupancy may still be seen, to the\r\nnearest railway station, or even to Seville itself. Of course, if\r\nconditions permit, wagons are used, but since Spain is not a country\r\nfamous for its good roads, it is probable that for many years to come\r\nthe burro will play his part in supplying the cork markets of the\r\nworld. [Illustration:\r\n\r\nBaling Corkwood at Seville]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nOne of the Corkwood Warehouses, Seville Plant]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nThe Giralda, Seville]\r\n\r\nAlthough large supplies of raw material are drawn from Portugal, the\r\nprincipal foreign warehouse and Spanish factory of the Armstrong Cork\r\nCompany are situated in Seville; hence it is to that historic city\r\non the banks of the Guadalquivir that the bark from many hills and\r\nvalleys finds its way during the summer months. There the bales as\r\nthey come from the country are opened, the bark boiled and scraped, if\r\nthis has not already been done, and then, after the edges have been\r\ntrimmed, is sorted into a dozen or more grades of different quality and\r\nthickness. The importance of this last mentioned operation cannot be\r\noveremphasized, as the whole problem of the successful and economical\r\nmanufacture of cork centers about it. The expert Spanish sorters having\r\nfinished their work, the bark is ready to be rebaled for shipment to\r\nAmerica. Broad sheets are placed in a baling box to form the bottom of\r\nthe bale, and above them are laid smaller pieces, which are covered in\r\nturn with larger sections; then the whole mass is subjected to pressure\r\nto render it compact, afterward being bound up securely with steel\r\nhoops or wire. Each bale is carefully stenciled with marks indicating\r\ngrade or quality. Loaded directly into ocean-going steamers alongside\r\nthe Seville docks, not infrequently a whole ship’s cargo of cork at a\r\ntime is transported to Philadelphia, New York, or Baltimore, and thence\r\nfreighted to the Pittsburgh factory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nThe Wharf at Seville. Loading Bales of Corkwood for America]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBale of Corkwood]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSpaniards cutting Bark into Strips and Squares]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCutting Corks by Hand]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nThe Factory at Pittsburgh]\r\n\r\nFrom the mountain of cork unloaded at its doors a host of different\r\narticles are produced by means of wonderfully ingenious machinery\r\ncoupled with hundreds of keen brains, for the human element must always\r\nplay a large part in cork manufacture. Among them corks rank first in\r\nimportance; hence the greater part of the floor space of this factory,\r\nthe largest of its kind in the world, is given over to their production.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSlicing into Strips]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBales of Cork being unloaded at Pittsburgh]\r\n\r\nFor whatever purpose it is to be used, all bark removed from the\r\nimmense storage rooms is taken first to the sorting department, where,\r\nunder skilled eyes, the twenty-five or more foreign grades are resorted\r\ninto approximately one hundred and fifty different classes, according\r\nto quality and thickness. The speed and skill with which this work is\r\ndone is astounding. So slight is the difference between some of the\r\ngrades that to the inexperienced eye none can be seen whatever, and yet\r\nsuccess hinges on the care and skill exercised in this and the other\r\nsortings that follow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCorks punched from Strips]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nOne of the Fourteen Storage Rooms, Pittsburgh Factory]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Punchings]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nOne of the Corkwood Sorting Rooms at Pittsburgh]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCutting into Squares]\r\n\r\nIn manufacturing corks it must be understood in the first place\r\nthat the thickness of a given piece of bark determines the maximum\r\ndiameter of the stopper which can be made from it, as the cutting\r\nis done across and not with the grain. Leaving the sorting room the\r\ncorkwood is softened by placing it in a warm vapor bath. This process\r\nincreases its flexibility greatly, its bulk slightly, and prepares it\r\nto undergo the various mechanical operations which follow in rapid\r\nsuccession. The keen edge of the slicer first confronts the sheets of\r\nbark, and it is at this point that the first mechanical obstacle in\r\ncork manufacture has to be overcome, for the soft, light, elastic\r\nmaterial is, withal, very difficult to cut, as may be determined by\r\nsimple personal experiment. But before the onslaught of a circular\r\nsteel knife, revolving hundreds of revolutions every minute and kept\r\nat razor-like sharpness, even this difficulty disappears, and the\r\nsheets are readily cut into strips whose width is determined by the\r\nlength of the cork desired. From the slicer the strips pass to the\r\nblocking machines, where, by means of a rapidly rotating tubular punch,\r\ncylindrical pieces are bored out and released with almost incredible\r\nspeed. The operative, of course, must use care to avoid defective spots\r\nin the bark, and also to cut the corks out as closely together as\r\npossible so as to reduce waste to a minimum. The stoppers which come\r\nfrom these machines are round with parallel sides. If tapered corks are\r\ndesired, larger at the upper end than at the lower, the cylindrical\r\nor “straight” pieces must be passed through another machine, which\r\nhandles them deftly, holding them against the edge of another circular\r\nknife. Seemingly motionless, the only outward indication of the speed\r\nwith which the keen blade is revolving is the delicate shaving which\r\ncurls upward for an instant, only to be drawn away through pipes by\r\npowerful air-suction to the mill building a hundred yards distant,\r\nwhere all such waste is ground up, to be disposed of in the form of\r\nvarious by-products. Both “straights” and “tapers” next journey to the\r\nwashing rooms. There dumped in great vats, thousands at a time, they\r\nare carefully washed and then dried by being whirled about dizzily in\r\ngreat revolving cylinders of wire net located in heated chambers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBlocking Department at Pittsburgh]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Insoles]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMaking Tapered Corks at Pittsburgh]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nWashers and Gaskets]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nA Glimpse of Another Department, Pittsburgh Factory]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Balls]\r\n\r\nNot all of the bark, however, that is destined to be turned into corks\r\nfollows the course that has just been described; for certain varieties\r\na different process of manufacture, approximating in many respects the\r\noriginal Spanish method, is found more practicable. The crude bark,\r\nafter being sorted, is cut into strips on the slicing machines, the\r\nwidth as before depending on the length of the stopper to be made. To\r\nremove the rest of the hard back, or outer crust, much of which still\r\nremains despite the scraping before shipment to America, the pieces\r\nare then passed beneath a revolving knife which shaves off the rough,\r\nuneven portion. Free now from objectionable matter, the strips are cut\r\ninto small rectangular blocks of the dimensions of the cork desired. In\r\nthis process, just as in blocking, care must be taken to avoid defects\r\nin the bark, and at the same time to prevent waste. Passing to another\r\ndepartment the rectangular pieces are rounded into proper shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSorting Tapered Corks at Pittsburgh Factory]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Polishing Wheels]\r\n\r\nIn Spain, before the days of large cork factories employing labor\r\nsaving machinery, and even to a great extent at the present time,\r\nall of these operations are carried out by hand. Whole families\r\nparticipate, slicing the bark into strips, then into squares,\r\nand finally cutting the corks from the square blocks slowly and\r\nlaboriously. This hand method of manufacture is gradually disappearing\r\nas more and more machinery comes into general use. What are known as\r\nhand cut corks are stoppers which are not exactly round, but of a shape\r\nwhich might be appropriately described as a “square circle.” In the\r\njudgment of some, they are better suited for certain purposes than\r\nstraights or tapers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPacking Department at Pittsburgh]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Paper]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPutting Final Touches on Life-Preservers]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nSeine and Gill Corks]\r\n\r\nFrom the driers all corks are taken to the sorting rooms, where they\r\nare subjected to the last of the actual manufacturing processes, and,\r\nfrom many standpoints, the most interesting of all. Here, again, the\r\nimportance of proper grading is paramount, and when one considers that\r\nalmost five million corks pour into this department every working day,\r\nthe magnitude of the task can be partly grasped. When the further\r\nfact is known that this enormous output is to be sorted into about\r\ntwenty regular besides numerous special grades, one can still further\r\nappreciate what the problem involves. The work itself calls for such\r\na peculiar combination of faculties that only one out of every five\r\noperatives who are given preliminary training in this department is\r\nfound satisfactory; but so highly skilled do the regular workers become\r\nthat the sorting of thirty-five thousand corks may be considered an\r\naverage day’s labor. Experts exercise careful supervision and actually\r\ntest each lot of corks as they come from the operatives in order that\r\nuniform standards may be maintained from day to day and month to month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCircle A Corks]\r\n\r\nWhen past the keen eye of the tester, the cork, after its long journey\r\nthrough the factory, passes either direct to the packing department or\r\nto the warehouses. This last point involves a problem which is often\r\nvery puzzling and difficult of solution. Thousands of dollars’ worth\r\nof corks are placed in the warehouses every year to remain there\r\nindefinitely. An order for a quantity of corks of a certain size and\r\nquality also involves, of necessity, the manufacture of a great many\r\ncorks of other grades. The reason for this is, of course, found in\r\nthe fact that the raw material, no matter how carefully sorted at the\r\noutset, will not produce a finished product of uniform quality. Thus\r\nfrequently it becomes necessary to work over a given lot of corks for\r\nwhich there is no demand into a smaller size for which orders are\r\npouring in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCircle B Corks]\r\n\r\nInto the packing department streams a bewildering array of corks of\r\nevery conceivable shape, grade, and size. The tapers appear in a dozen\r\nqualities, at the head of which stand the peerless “Circle A” and\r\n“Circle B,” prescription corks found in every first-class pharmacy in\r\nthe land. The straights have been separated into various classes,\r\nrunning from the fine champagne corks down to the common soda water\r\ncorks. Besides, there are keg corks, hand cut corks, mustard and jar\r\ncorks of large diameter, shell corks, perforated through the center,\r\nand glued corks made up of several layers, all of which must be put up\r\nin packages of suitable size, ready to be delivered to the shipping\r\ndepartment for transportation to the consumer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nTapered Corks, X Grade]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nBobbers for Fishing Lines]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nLarge Tapered Corks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nInstrument and Fishing Rod Handles]\r\n\r\nA host of other useful articles also find their way from the many\r\nmanufacturing departments to the shipping rooms. Of insoles thousands\r\nof pairs are produced annually. Discs and washers by the million\r\nare punched out for use in metal caps for bottles and jars, and as\r\ngaskets in lubricator cups. Life-preservers, ring buoys, yacht fenders,\r\nmooring and anchoring buoys are the specialties of one department,\r\nwhile another pays particular attention to the manufacture of seine\r\nand gill corks, and bobbers for fishing lines. So varied, in fact,\r\nare the forms which cork assumes that the complete cataloguing of\r\nthe functions which it fills in the world to-day would be well-nigh\r\nimpossible. For instance, cork shapes may be found in animal heads on\r\nrugs and fur garments, and, covered with suitable material, are used\r\nas buttons on fur coats. Cork balls play their part in exhibiting\r\ncutlery and in various games; the automobilist finds cork carburetor\r\nfloats indispensable; churn lids are made tight with cork gaskets;\r\npen holders have cork tips; hats are lined with thin sheets of cork;\r\nfriction clutches of cork are steadily growing in favor; the optician\r\nemploys small cork strips in connection with eyeglasses; the plasterer\r\nuses cork floats; while the glass manufacturer knows no better medium\r\nfor polishing his wares than cork wheels. The finest pieces of bark\r\nare made into cork paper, so thin that five hundred sheets measure but\r\none inch in thickness. Sorted into several different grades, this\r\nbeautiful, velvety material is practically all used in making cigarette\r\ntips. Fishing rod, whip, bicycle, trowel, and pyrographic instrument\r\nhandles of cork are, of course, familiar to every one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nStraight Wine Corks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nStraight Soda Corks, D Grade]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nGranulated Cork]\r\n\r\nBut the manufacture of corks and of all these other articles involves\r\nwaste, and waste to an extent little dreamed of. In producing corks,\r\nfor instance, fully sixty-five per cent of the raw material which\r\nstarted out on its journey through the factory may be found later in\r\nthe form of scrap at the blocking and tapering machines; but even in\r\nthis mutilated state the bark is still valuable, and after proper\r\ntreatment in the Pittsburgh plant, or one of the other factories of\r\nthe Company, appears in the form of numerous by-products of great\r\nvalue and importance. As a matter of fact, nothing is wasted; even the\r\nsmallest particles are utilized. Large quantities of scrap are ground\r\nup, sifted, and made into composition cork with the aid of suitable\r\nbinders. From “Suberit,” as the finest variety of this material is\r\ntermed--light, close grained, and tough, without the large pores of the\r\nnatural cork--table mats to be placed under hot dishes, pin cushions,\r\nfishing line floats, polishing wheels, and instrument handles are\r\nmanufactured; while from “Acme,” a somewhat coarser grade, are made\r\ninsoles, bath mats, washers, gaskets, and entomological cork--thin\r\nsheets for mounting insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nKeg Corks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nPlasterer’s Float]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nHand Cut Corks, A Grade]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Carburetor Floats]\r\n\r\nPart of the waste is reduced to the form of cork shavings and used\r\nto stuff mattresses and boat cushions, for packing eggs and other\r\nfragile articles, and in making cork floor tiling. This material is\r\nmanufactured in three shades of brown, and its warmth of tone and\r\ndelicately mottled and veined appearance give it a distinctive charm\r\npeculiarly its own. Smooth and soft as velvet to the touch, cork\r\ntiling is nevertheless firm and resilient and able to stand years of\r\nhard service. Thousands of square feet have been installed in hotels,\r\nlibraries, museums, clubs, and private residences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nHand Cut Corks, C Grade]\r\n\r\nCork flour is another by-product, and is manufactured from the waste\r\nbark by much the same method as that employed in grinding wheat. This\r\nbeautiful light brown dust is one of the chief constituents of high\r\ngrade linoleum. In the Company’s plant at Lancaster, Pennsylvania,\r\nthousands of yards of this material are produced every day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMooring and Anchoring Buoys]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nJar, Mustard, and Shell Corks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nRing Buoy]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nLife-Preserver]\r\n\r\nThe many different grades of granulated cork, made by grinding up\r\ncork waste, find a wide sphere of usefulness for packing and heat\r\ninsulating purposes. In this last mentioned field, in fact, cork now\r\nranks preeminent. Its peculiar structure, which may be seen under\r\nthe microscope--myriads of sealed air cells, impervious to air and\r\nwater--renders it not only a splendid nonconductor of heat, but also\r\nnonabsorbent of moisture. For loose filling between the walls of ice\r\nboxes, water coolers, and cold storage rooms, and about the sides of\r\nfreezing tanks in ice factories, hundreds of tons of granulated cork\r\nare employed every year. Comparatively recently, however, an insulating\r\nmaterial possessing permanency of form has been found desirable for\r\nmany reasons. To meet this demand granulated cork is transformed into\r\ncorkboard at the Company’s plants at Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, and\r\nCamden, New Jersey. Using the pure cork, either with or without an\r\nasphaltic binder, three grades of this material are made, known as\r\nNonpareil, Impregnated, and Acme Corkboard, respectively. The sheets\r\nmeasure twelve by thirty-six inches, of various thicknesses, and, as\r\nthey possess ample structural strength, may be nailed into place in\r\nbuildings or rooms of frame construction, or put up with Portland\r\ncement against brick, stone, or concrete walls and ceilings. A plaster\r\nfinish is readily applied. Owing to its freedom from progressive\r\ndeterioration, its constant efficiency, its slow burning and fire\r\nretarding properties, and its sanitary qualities, corkboard insulation\r\nis now recognized as the standard throughout the land, and may be\r\nfound installed almost everywhere refrigeration is employed. Hundreds\r\nof cold storage warehouses, abattoirs, fur storage vaults, breweries,\r\nice plants, dairies, creameries, candy factories, and bakeries are\r\ninsulated with it, not to mention refrigerated rooms in hotels, clubs,\r\nprivate residences, and aboard the ships of the United States, British,\r\nand Italian navies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Floor Tiling]\r\n\r\nAnother by-product, and the last one of importance, is cork pipe\r\ncovering for insulating cold pipe lines. Made of pure granulated cork,\r\nslightly compressed and molded in sectional form to fit the many\r\ndifferent sizes of pipe and kinds of fittings, it is a thoroughly\r\ndurable covering for brine and ammonia piping in refrigerating plants,\r\nand for ice water lines in office buildings, hotels, and industrial\r\nestablishments. In this rôle the cork bark, after its devious career\r\nin American factories, performs a service similar to that of its early\r\ndays in Spain, when, sheathing trunk and branches, it prevented the\r\nsun’s rays and the parching winds from heating and drying up the cool,\r\nlife-giving sap of its parent tree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nNonpareil Corkboard]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCork Pipe Covering]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Rogers & Company\r\n  Chicago and New York\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note\r\n\r\n  Minor punctuation errors have been changed without notice.
