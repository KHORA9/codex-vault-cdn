While the work may be of little service to\r\nthe profession, it is hoped those connected with water-works and the\r\ngeneral reader will find sufficient compensation for the time lost in\r\nits perusal.\r\n\r\nThe authorities quoted are the highest, and the general facts are\r\nfrom the most reliable sources. Considerable space is given to\r\npollution of water, believing it to be the most important question\r\nthat bears on the subject before us. Water-works officials will find\r\nuseful information in the work, which is so frequently desired and\r\nsometimes difficult to obtain.\r\n\r\nDue acknowledgments are made for information derived from the\r\nfollowing works: Rivers Pollution Commission, (London,) 1874;\r\nHumber’s Water Supply of Cities and Towns; Fanning’s Water Supply\r\nEngineering, (New York,) 1876; History and Statistics of American\r\nWater-Works, by J.

B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an historical fact that the water supply of Rome, during\r\nthe first century of our era, was so abundant “that whole rivers\r\nflowed through the streets of Rome.” The quantity was estimated at\r\n375 million gallons per day, an equivalent to 375 gallons for each\r\ninhabitant. This supply was conducted to the city through nine costly\r\nand marvelous conduits of brick and stone, that tunneled hills and\r\ncrossed rivers and ravines in the boldest manner, presenting most\r\nskillful engineering ability. The number was afterwards increased\r\nto fourteen. The principal aqueducts were: Aqua Martia, erected B.\r\nC. 431, was 38 miles in length, part of which was composed of 7,000\r\narches. Aqua Claudia, a subterranean channel for 36¼ miles; 10¾ miles\r\na surface conduit, 3 miles a vaulted tunnel, and 7 miles on lofty\r\narcades, had a capacity for delivering 96 million gallons daily. New\r\nAnio was 43 miles in length. Some of these aqueducts were made of\r\nthree distinct arches, one above the other, that conveyed waters from\r\nsources of different elevations.\r\n\r\nConstantinople presents remains of the skill possessed by the Romans\r\nin the numerous subterraneous reservoirs, covered with stone arcades\r\nsupported by pillars. Pont du Gard is another relict that supplied\r\nthe town of Nismes, France. “It consists of 3 tiers of arches, the\r\nlowest of 6 arches, supporting 11 of equal span in the center tier,\r\nsurmounted by 35 of smaller size. Its height is 180 feet, the channel\r\nway being 5 feet high by 10 feet wide; the capacity was estimated at\r\n14 million gallons per day.”\r\n\r\nIn Mexico and Peru are found water channels of marvelous length,\r\nwhile India is noted for the numerous impounding reservoirs of\r\nwonderful dimensions,--the Poniary reservoir, having an area of\r\n50,000 acres, and banks 50 miles in extent.\r\n\r\nWhile the ancients have left monuments of their skill in gathering\r\nand conducting waters, modern science has been, and is, endeavoring\r\nto leave a reputation for its devotion to the knowledge of pollution\r\nin, and purification of waters required for mankind.\r\n\r\nThe vast amount of literature devoted to this subject, containing a\r\nvaried scope of discussions, arguments and analyses, has a tendency\r\nto lead one to the conclusion that wholesome water scarcely exists.\r\nIn fact, the theory advanced by the Massachusetts State Board of\r\nHealth, in their Fifth Annual Report, is not so premature. They say:\r\n\r\n  “The time may come when it will be necessary to supply our drinking\r\n  water from sedulously guarded but limited sources of supply, and to\r\n  furnish for manufacturing and other uses less pure water. This plan\r\n  is partly carried out in Paris, and it is the purpose to enlarge\r\n  it, although much of the water is unfit to drink.\r\n\r\n  “The injurious character of a water, impregnated with sewage\r\n  matter, might not be discovered for years. You might go on using\r\n  it for years and might not be discovered, and you might have some\r\n  outbreak of disease in the place, which nevertheless might be\r\n  connected with the use of that sewage water.”\r\n\r\nThe Rivers Pollution Commission of Great Britain struggled with\r\nthis subject for six years, and at last resolved upon the following\r\nclassification of potable waters:\r\n\r\n              { 1. Spring water.         }\r\n  Wholesome,  { 2. Deep well water.      } very palatable.\r\n              { 3. Upland surface water. }\r\n\r\n              { 4. Stored rain water.                   } moderately\r\n  Suspicious, { 5. Surface water from cultivated lands. }  palatable.\r\n\r\n              { 6. River water to which sewage gains }\r\n  Dangerous,  {      access.                         } palatable.\r\n              { 7. Shallow well water.               }\r\n\r\nThe constituent parts of pure water, in volumes, are two parts of\r\nhydrogen and one of oxygen, and by weight one part hydrogen and eight\r\nparts oxygen. When pure it is transparent, tasteless, inodorous,\r\nand colorless, except when seen in considerable depths. But having\r\nsuch high solvent powers and affinity for almost every substance in\r\nnature, one can account for suspicions that science places on all\r\nwaters, for it is never free from impurities. And well it may not, if\r\ndoctors are to be believed, for they tell us, that chemically pure\r\nwater is not best for man; that good potable waters have from one to\r\neight grains weight in each gallon of certain impurities diffused\r\nthrough them. Impurities are arranged under the following general\r\nheads:\r\n\r\nRain Water--Atmospheric influences.\r\n\r\nSpring and Well Water--Mineral properties.\r\n\r\nRivers, Lakes--Vegetable and animal organisms.\r\n\r\nBut what can we consider good drinking water? Dr. Frankland, of\r\nEngland, has given the following as a minimum limit of mechanical and\r\nchemical impurities held in suspension or solution, to be considered\r\nbad or polluted liquid:\r\n\r\n  _A._ Every liquid which has not been submitted to precipitation,\r\n  produced by a perfect repose in reservoirs of sufficient\r\n  dimensions, during a period of at least six hours; or which, having\r\n  been submitted to precipitation, contains in suspension more\r\n  than one part by weight of dry organic matter in 100,000 parts\r\n  of liquid; or which, not having been submitted to precipitation,\r\n  contains in suspension more than three parts by weight of dry\r\n  mineral matter, or one part by weight of dry organic matter in\r\n  100,000 parts of liquid.\r\n\r\n  _B._ Every liquid containing in solution more than two parts by\r\n  weight of organic carbon, or three parts of organic nitrogen, in\r\n  100,000 parts of liquid.\r\n\r\n  _C._ Every liquid which, when placed in a white porcelain vessel to\r\n  the depth of one inch, exhibits under daylight distinct color.\r\n\r\n  _D._ Every liquid which contains in solution, in every 100,000\r\n  parts by weight, more than two parts of any metal, except calcium,\r\n  magnesium, potassium and sodium.\r\n\r\n  _E._ Every liquid which in every 100,000 parts by weight contains\r\n  in solution, suspension, chemical combination or otherwise, more\r\n  than 0.5 metallic arsenic.\r\n\r\n  _F._ Every liquid which, after the addition of sulphuric acid,\r\n  contains in every 100,000 parts by weight more than one part of\r\n  free chlorine.\r\n\r\n  _G._ Every liquid which in every 100,000 parts by weight contains\r\n  more than one part of sulphur, in the state of sulphuretted\r\n  hydrogen or of a soluble sulphuret.\r\n\r\n  _H._ Every liquid having an acidity superior to that produced by\r\n  adding two parts by weight of hydrochloric acid to 1000 parts of\r\n  distilled water.\r\n\r\n  _I._ Every liquid having an alkalinity greater than that produced\r\n  by adding one part by weight of caustic soda to 1000 parts of\r\n  distilled water.\r\n\r\n  _J._ Every liquid exhibiting on its surface a film of petroleum, or\r\n  hydrocarbon, or containing in suspension, in 100,000 parts, more\r\n  than 0.5 of such oils.\r\n\r\nBut to arrive at a fair and impartial conclusion, authorities now\r\nagree that analyses and investigations must be often, and for a\r\nprolonged period of not less than one year. The aim of modern\r\nscientists, in their analyses, is to detect the amount of organic\r\n(especially sewage) contamination. Dr. Frankland’s method is by the\r\nestimation of organic carbon and nitrogen, while Wanklyn, Chapman,\r\nand Smith reach their conclusions by estimation of nitrogenous\r\norganic matter, by breaking up the organic bodies and separating\r\ntheir nitrogen in the form of albuminoid ammonia. Ammonia is the\r\nmeasure of that portion of organic matter not decomposed but in state\r\nof or capable of undergoing putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe maximum amount of free ammonia permissible in good drinking water\r\nis .5 of a grain per 1000 gallons, and of albuminoid ammonia .9 of a\r\ngrain per 1000 gallons.\r\n\r\nUpon the above basis the relative merits of the following waters may\r\nbe formed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  NUMBER OF GRAINS OF SEWAGE IN EACH THOUSAND GALLONS.\r\n\r\n  ============+=============+=====+=======+========+========+================\r\n              |             |     |       |        |Albumi- |\r\n              |             |     |       | Free   |  noid  |\r\n    Cities.   |  Source.    |Date.|Author-|Ammonia.|Ammonia.|  Remarks.\r\n              |             |     |  ity. |Grains. |Grains. |\r\n  ------------+-------------+-----+-------+--------+--------+----------------\r\n  Philadelphia|Schuylkill   |1874 |Booth &|  1.17  |   1.76 |Fairmount.\r\n              |             |     |Garrett|        |        |\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  5.85  |   5.11 |Belmont.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  7.31  |   5.12 |Flat Rock.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  1.46  |   7.31 |Perkiomen.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  | 17.50  |   8.75 |Spring Garden.\r\n       “      |Delaware     | “   |    “  | 25.74  |  11.70 |\r\n  London      |Artesian Well| “   |    “  |  none  |   1.75 |Bryn Maws.\r\n       “      |Thames       | “   |    “  |  1.00  |   5.31 |\r\n  Detroit     |Detroit      |1879 |Stearns|  3.09  |   7.29 |Hydrant.\r\n  Hoboken     |Passaic      |1880 |Leeds  |  1.72  |  19.22 |Hydrant water.\r\n  Jersey City |Passaic      | “   |    “  |  2.96  |  22.28 |      “\r\n  Patterson   |Passaic      | “   |    “  |  1.50  |  30.90 |      “\r\n  New York    |Croton       | “   |    “  |  1.60  |  15.70 |      “\r\n  Brooklyn    |Long Island  | “   |    “  |   .50  |   4.80 |      “\r\n  Boston      |Lake         | “   |    “  |  7.60  |  35.60 |      “\r\n              |  Cochituate |     |       |        |        |\r\n  Rochester   |Hemlock Lake | “   |    “  |   .90  |  13.00 |      “\r\n  Philadelphia|Schuylkill   | “   |    “  |   .60  |  10.50 |      “\r\n  Wilmington  |Delaware     | “   |    “  |  2.00  |  17.50 |      “\r\n  Baltimore   |             | “   |    “  |  2.90  |  11.70 |      “\r\n  Washington  |Potomac      | “   |    “  |  3.50  |  15.70 |      “\r\n  Oswego      |             | “   |    “  |  2.00  |  15.20 |      “\r\n       “      |Well         | “   |    “  |  4.90  |  12.30 |      “\r\n  Cincinnati  |Ohio River   | “   |    “  |  6.70  |  14.00 |      “\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |Stuntz |   .87  |   1.40 |Markley Farm,\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |best condition.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  2.45  |  36.42 |Markley Farm,\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |worst condition.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  3.15  |   4.37 |Dayton Sand B’ch\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |best condition.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  2.33  |  14.24 |Dayton Sand B’ch\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |worst condition.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  | 13.48  |  11.67 |Eden Reservoir,\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |best condition.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  | 12.20  |  42.50 |Eden Reservoir,\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |worst condition.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  2.92  |   9.10 |Pump House,\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |best condition.\r\n       “      |    “        | “   |    “  |  4.43  |  79.73 |Pump House,\r\n              |             |     |       |        |        |worst condition.\r\n  ------------+-------------+-----+-------+--------+--------+----------------\r\n\r\nThe Rivers Pollution Commission value the quality of water by the\r\nprevious sewage or animal contamination, as they term it. This\r\nexpression is obtained by taking, as a standard of comparison, the\r\namount of total combined nitrogen (which is assumed as 10 parts),\r\nin solution, in 100,000 parts of average London sewage. The parts of\r\nnitrogen obtained, in the form of nitrates, nitrites, and ammonia,\r\nless .032 part of 100,000 for that portion in rain, is that nitrogen\r\nderived from animal matter. Animal matters dissolved in water, such\r\nas those contained in sewage, the contents of privies and cess-pools,\r\nor farm-yard manure, undergo oxidation in lakes, rivers and streams\r\nvery slowly, but, in the pores of an open soil, very rapidly. When\r\nthis oxidation is complete, they are resolved into mineral compounds;\r\ntheir carbon is converted into carbonic acid; and their hydrogen\r\ninto water; but their nitrogen is transformed partly into ammonia\r\nand chiefly into nitrous and nitric acids.

Suspicious or doubtful water is, first,\r\nriver or flowing water which exhibits any proportion, however small,\r\nof previous sewage; and, second, well or spring water containing\r\n10,000 to 20,000 parts. Dangerous water is, first, river or flowing\r\nwater which exhibits more than 20,000 parts of previous animal\r\ncontamination; second, river or flow water containing less than\r\n20,000 parts of previous contamination, coming from sewage discharged\r\ninto it directly, or mingling with it as surface drainage; third,\r\nwell or deep-seated springs containing more than 20,000 parts,\r\nbecause previous contamination is in direct proportion to the amount\r\nof such contamination.\r\n\r\nThe value of an analysis, sanitarily considered, is questioned. Mr.\r\nSimon, medical officer of Her Majesty’s Privy Council, testified,\r\nbefore the Royal Commission on Water Supply, on this point, as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  “There are dangerous qualities of water supply with regard to\r\n  which, so far as I know, chemists are totally unable to measure,\r\n  even to demonstrate the fatal influences that a water may have.\r\n  A water may be, for instance, capable of spreading the cholera,\r\n  but chemists be unable to identify the particular contamination\r\n  which produces that effect. It is, I think, a matter of absolute\r\n  demonstration that, in the old epidemics, when the south side of\r\n  London suffered so dreadfully from cholera, the great cause of the\r\n  immense mortality there was a badness of the water supply then\r\n  distributed in those districts of London.”\r\n\r\nProf. Frankland says:\r\n\r\n  “That we have no reason to believe that the injurious character of\r\n  either sewage or of the gases from a drain depends fundamentally\r\n  upon the quality of that sewage or of that gas. In all probability\r\n  it far more depends upon the quality of the sewage, namely, what\r\n  it consists of. Now, what is the nature of the poisonous matter\r\n  in the atmosphere or in the sewage? We do not know that, at all;\r\n  therefore you can not possibly say when that poisonous matter is\r\n  got rid of from the water or from the air. Chemical analysis can\r\n  not do it, for its limit is by the power of weighing and measuring.\r\n  It is not sufficiently advanced, and is one of the poorest things\r\n  possible to reach those delicate points.”\r\n\r\nVital statistics are sources of reliable information; and from them\r\nwe can learn more of the propagation or dissemination of certain\r\ndiseases through the water supply, and the relation of water to\r\nhealth. The cholera epidemics of Great Britain exhibit striking\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\nThe following are tabulations from the Rivers Pollution Commission\r\nReport, 1874:\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON.\r\n\r\n  YEAR.

Have you any complaint to make of the water supply? No. The\r\n  water that we have in Paisley is of a very superior character,\r\n  and there is an unlimited supply to the whole of the inhabitants.\r\n  The supply is constant, and I regard that as one of the greatest\r\n  blessings the people ever received.\r\n\r\n  “2. Is there any water used which is obtained from wells? None.\r\n  During the last epidemic of cholera the wells were ordered to be\r\n  entirely shut up.\r\n\r\n  “3. When did the last epidemic of cholera occur? Four years ago.\r\n  But I should say it was not epidemic in Paisley then. It was\r\n  threatened in 1866.\r\n\r\n  “4. Had you any cases of cholera then? No. There was a danger felt\r\n  about it, but I had no fear of it; and I expressed that opinion\r\n  before the Sanitary Committee, that we should have no attack of\r\n  cholera, and that the city of Glasgow would not have it.\r\n\r\n  “5. On what did you found that opinion? Upon the unlimited supply\r\n  of pure water that we had, and on the supply of pure water that\r\n  Glasgow had obtained from Loch Katrine.\r\n\r\n  “6. Was your prediction fulfilled in both cases? Yes.\r\n\r\n  “7. When had you cholera last in Paisley? Was it in 1854? In 1854.\r\n\r\n  “8. Had you an attack of cholera in 1849? Yes. A very sharp attack.\r\n\r\n  “9. What was the state of the water supply in 1849? In 1848 and\r\n  1849 the town was but partially supplied with water, and some of\r\n  the large suburbs, such as Charleston, were not supplied with the\r\n  town’s water. Charleston was supplied with water from wells. There\r\n  was one well that belonged to Baille Smith, which supplied a large\r\n  quadrangle of buildings; that well was at the bottom of an incline,\r\n  surmounted by buildings on all sides except one. Those wells took\r\n  a supply from the surface. They were surrounded by dung-pits, and\r\n  the wells imbibed the impurities of the dung-pits. I took occasion\r\n  to warn the people of the district not to use water from the wells,\r\n  but to get the town’s water. I recommended the authorities to open\r\n  pipes connected with the town’s water, and to supply Charleston\r\n  with pure water; and very soon after that was done the cholera\r\n  disappeared from that district. At the last threatened visitation\r\n  of cholera, in 1866, the Sanitary Committee took the precaution to\r\n  remove all the handles from the pumps, and they had the wells shut\r\n  up.\r\n\r\n  “10. Do you think there is a direct connection between the water\r\n  supplied to a town and the propagation of cholera? I believe that\r\n  there is a very intimate connection between the use of impure water\r\n  and the propagation of cholera; and the proper antidote to that is\r\n  a free and unrestricted supply of pure water.”\r\n\r\nIn Calcutta the yearly death rates from cholera averaged nearly 4,000\r\nfrom 1841 to 1870. When water-works were introduced the rate of\r\ndeaths were:\r\n\r\n  1870     1,560\r\n  1871       790\r\n  1872     1,068\r\n  1873     1,134\r\n\r\nThe famous Broad Street pump, in London, in 1848, killed 500 persons\r\nin a single week.\r\n\r\nIn 1866 many deaths occurred from the use of water from a famous\r\npump in Brooklyn. All trouble was brought to an end when the health\r\nofficers removed the handle.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever and diarrhea are universally traced to impure water,\r\nand numerous examples can be given that were directly due to this\r\ncause. The enterprising town of Rugby, on the Cincinnati Southern\r\nRailroad, furnished us with a case of this nature. In Millbank\r\nPrison, England, typhoid fever was especially fatal until the year\r\n1854, when the supply was taken from an artesian well in Trafalgar\r\nSquare, instead of the Thames; and immediately thereafter, and up to\r\nApril, 1872, a period of eighteen years, there have been only three\r\ndeaths from typhoid fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nRIVER POLLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject is possibly most interesting to Cincinnati, because of\r\nits direct application to our source. River water is next to the most\r\nsuspicious of waters, and the character is the bone of contention\r\namong scientists. Just how far and how much sewage may be admitted,\r\nand what influences are exerted to destroy it, are interesting\r\ndiscussions, part of which we have quoted.\r\n\r\nThe Rivers Pollution Commission of Great Britain arrived at the\r\nconclusion “that there is no river in the United Kingdom long enough\r\nto effect the destruction of sewage by oxidation.” And a direct\r\ncontradiction of the statement by the eminent physician, Dr. Letheby,\r\nmedical officer to corporation of London, “that if sewage matter be\r\nmixed with twenty times its bulk of ordinary river water, and flow a\r\ndozen miles, there is not a particle of that sewage to be discovered\r\nby chemical means.”\r\n\r\nThe experiments of this commission show “that scarcely two-thirds of\r\nthe sewage was destroyed in a flow of 168 miles, at the rate of one\r\nmile per hour, or after the lapse of a week.”\r\n\r\nInvestigations of the Rivers Pollution Commission on Sewage Pollution\r\nare as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  REDUCTION BY OXIDATION IN RUNNING WATER.\r\n\r\n  --------+--------------+-----------+---------------------------------\r\n          |              |           |   PERCENTAGE OF REDUCTION OF\r\n  NAME OF |LENGTH OF FLOW|TEMPERATURE|        ORGANIC ELEMENT.\r\n  RIVER.  |  IN MILES.   |CENTIGRADE.+---------------+-----------------\r\n          |              |           |IN ORG.

After agitation and freely exposed to the air and light\r\nevery day, and being syphoned, in a slender stream, from one vessel\r\nto another, the result, after 96 hours, was .250 organic carbon, and\r\n.058 organic nitrogen; and, after 196 hours’ test, was .2 organic\r\ncarbon, and .054 organic nitrogen.

To destroy organic matter the\r\nmost powerful oxidizing agents are required. We must boil it with\r\nnitric acid and chloric acid and the most perfect chemical agents. To\r\nthink to get rid of organic matter by exposure to the air for a short\r\ntime is absurd.”\r\n\r\nProf. Frankland, one of the Rivers Pollution Commission of 1874,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  “That I should rely upon dilution quite as much and more than upon\r\n  the destruction of injurious matter; that the flow of a river has\r\n  a most natural influence in the removal of subsidence of a large\r\n  proportion of the suspended impurities both organic and mineral,\r\n  _especially if the flow be sluggish in places_.”\r\n\r\nProf. Brodie stated:\r\n\r\n  “There are causes operating, as we all know, to destroy the sewage\r\n  which, to a certain extent, will effect that end; but the question,\r\n  as I understand it, is, whether those causes are really adequate\r\n  to destroy the sewage, not partially but absolutely and entirely,\r\n  during a given course of the river? _I do not think, in the present\r\n  state of our knowledge, to pronounce an absolute opinion upon that\r\n  point._ But if you ask whether it is wise to drink water into which\r\n  you have put sewage, knowing that you have no means of getting that\r\n  sewage out of it, that is a question which any one can answer for\r\n  himself, assuming always the injurious character of sewage.”\r\n\r\nThe fifth annual report of the Board of Health of Massachusetts\r\n(1875), contains the following, on the effects of oxidation,\r\ndilution, and deposition:\r\n\r\n  “_Oxidation._--Although it is not practical, in the case of a\r\n  running stream like the Merrimack, to trace the progress of the\r\n  destruction of the organic material by oxidation, yet there is\r\n  no doubt that a certain amount is so destroyed. The presence of\r\n  nitrogen in the form of nitrites and nitrates is mainly due to the\r\n  oxidation of nitrogenous organic material. In the last report of\r\n  the Board, the reasons are given which lead to the belief that the\r\n  effects of oxidation have been overrated, although they are not, on\r\n  the other hand, to be depreciated.\r\n\r\n  “_Deposition._--Much waste material, thrown into rivers, is made up\r\n  wholly or in part of substances insoluble in water. A portion, and\r\n  a very considerable portion, even in a running stream is deposited\r\n  upon the bottom or stranded upon the banks. At the time of spring\r\n  freshets much that during the summer may have been deposited at\r\n  one part of the stream, in the bed or on the banks, is washed up\r\n  again, and mingling with the earthy materials, held in suspension,\r\n  is swept onward to the sea or enveloped in the earthy matter,\r\n  especially if this be of a clayey nature, is deposited lower down\r\n  the stream. These spring freshets are relied upon for cleansing\r\n  banks used for infiltration.\r\n\r\n  “_Dilution._--By far the most important reason of the apparent\r\n  disappearance of sewage and other waste material, is the fact that\r\n  the amount of solid matter is so small compared with the volume of\r\n  water into which it is thrown, that it is disseminated through the\r\n  mass and thus lost to observation, and in many cases to chemical\r\n  test.\r\n\r\n  “Analyses of water, below and above Lawrence and Lowell, showed no\r\n  increase in chlorine. The substance can not escape from the water\r\n  in gaseous form, nor does it deposit in insoluble combination, yet\r\n  first inspection would lead to a conclusion that no real increase\r\n  existed. The facts are that the reduction was due to dilution, and\r\n  not to any destruction or decomposition. Much depends of course\r\n  upon the size of the stream into which the refuse is thrown. Thus,\r\n  while into the Merrimack at Lowell, even during the minimum summer\r\n  flow of 2,100 cubic feet per second, it would be necessary to throw\r\n  more than 100 tons of solid matter daily in order to increase the\r\n  amount in the water by one grain to the gallon; another and smaller\r\n  stream might be hopelessly fouled by a single factory.”\r\n\r\nThe effects of dilution are shown in the analysis of the Schuylkill\r\nRiver--there being less sewage at Fairmount Dam, the nearest to\r\nthe outlet, than any point above. It is estimated that 300,000\r\ninhabitants, exclusive of those in Philadelphia, live within the\r\nwater-shed of this river, less than 150 miles above Philadelphia,\r\nthe undiluted sewage from these persons amounting annually to\r\n150,000 tons. In addition to this pollution 15,000,000 gallons daily\r\nflow from 115 establishments located on the banks, not considering\r\nthe 57 collieries and 76 anthracite furnaces. Yet with all this\r\ncontamination the water at Fairmount, chemically considered, is as\r\npure as most sources. The chemists in their report say: “Having now\r\nshown that the Schuylkill water is about as good a water as we might\r\nwish to find for a large city in its mineral and organic content.\r\n\r\n“Since the present water is good enough, we may keep it so, and even\r\nimprove it by a system of sewage gradually extended up both sides of\r\nthe river, especially the left bank, above the influence of Monayunk,\r\nand by procuring sufficient legislative power to control the escape\r\nof sewage or possibly injurious manufacturing residue. The long line\r\nof many miles would tend greatly to the purification of the water by\r\naeration, deposition, or abstraction of possibly injurious substances\r\nfrom the water by the time it reached within using distance of the\r\ncity.”\r\n\r\nThe increase of solid matter in the Schuylkill has been as follows:\r\n\r\n  1842, 4,421 grains in 1,000 gallons.\r\n  1854, 6,109 grains in 1,000 gallons.\r\n  1862, 7,040 grains in 1,000 gallons.\r\n  1875, 8,139 grains in 1,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe recent analysis by Prof. Stuntz of the Ohio River, also shows the\r\neffects of dilution. (The results express the number of pounds of\r\nsewage in one million gallons.)\r\n\r\n                                     GENERAL      WORST     GENERAL\r\n                                    CONDITION   CONDITION   AVERAGE\r\n                                       LBS.

There are one million persons above the intakes of\r\npumping works. The whole river and its principal tributaries are\r\nunder strictest sanitary regulation, which the government is able to\r\nenforce, notwithstanding a great mass of sewage is poured into the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nThe Rivers Pollution Commission, of 1874, sum up their investigation\r\nof the Thames and Lea Rivers as follows:\r\n\r\n  “1st. That the river receives the sewage from a large number\r\n  of towns and other inhabited places, the washings of a large\r\n  cultivated land, and the filthy discharge from many industrial\r\n  processes and manufactures.\r\n\r\n  “2d. That the water is used for bathing, washing of sheep and\r\n  cattle, and dirty linen and putrid carcasses of animals float upon\r\n  its surface.\r\n\r\n  “3d. That it is the common water way for a large amount of\r\n  dangerous polluting matter, etc.\r\n\r\n  “4th. That in time of flood a large proportion, both of the\r\n  suspended and dissolved filth, is conveyed down to the intakes, and\r\n  in ordinary weather considerable portion of soluble organic matter\r\n  makes its way to the pumping works, and is still present in the\r\n  water distributed _to the consumers_.\r\n\r\n  “5th. That the water is, nevertheless, when efficiently filtered,\r\n  free from any offensive taste or odor.\r\n\r\n  “6th. That, notwithstanding the application of partial remedies,\r\n  for sewage pollution, at Banbury, Eton, and Windsor, and the\r\n  great care exercised by most of the companies in the storage and\r\n  filtration of the water, the organic pollution contained in the\r\n  Thames water delivered in London, though subject to fluctuations\r\n  from the greater or less prevalence of floods, does not diminish.\r\n  The proportion of organic impurity present in Thames water, as\r\n  delivered in London, was:\r\n\r\n  “In 1868,   1,000\r\n   In 1869,   1,016\r\n   In 1870,     795\r\n   In 1871,     928\r\n   In 1872,   1,243\r\n   In 1873,     917\r\n\r\n  “7th. That there is no hope of this disgusting state of the river\r\n  being so far remedied as to preclude the presence of animal and\r\n  other offensive matters, even in the filtered Thames water as\r\n  delivered in the metropolis.\r\n\r\n  “8th. That the Thames should, therefore, as early as possible, be\r\n  abandoned as a source of water for domestic use.\r\n\r\n  “9th. That the temperature of the water drawn from the company’s\r\n  mains is liable to excessive fluctuations, being near the\r\n  freezing point in winter and so warm in summer as to be vapid and\r\n  unpalatable.”\r\n\r\nThe Lea River is also condemned as a source of water supply.\r\n\r\nProf. Chandler, of New York, quotes the authority of eminent\r\nscientists, who say the Thames, a short distance above London, is\r\nwholesome, palatable, and agreeable, and safe for domestic use,\r\nnotwithstanding the large amount of sewage (the number of grains per\r\ngallon being three times that of the Schuylkill), although controlled\r\nby strict governmental laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALITY OF POLLUTION.\r\n\r\nScientists tell us that it is not so much the quantity as the quality\r\nof the sewage:\r\n\r\n  “It is true a large amount of refuse material is of such character\r\n  as to be, except in excessive quantities, of no appreciable\r\n  influence on the human system; the addition of the inorganic\r\n  compounds of lime, soda, potash, etc., would have no deleterious\r\n  effect; in fact, although the lime compounds increase the hardness\r\n  of water, and make it less desirable for washing, the presence of a\r\n  moderate amount of mineral substance makes the water more palatable\r\n  and very probably more wholesome.\r\n\r\n  “Then, in case of many waste liquors, which appear to be\r\n  very offensive, the matter which really could be regarded as\r\n  injurious is comparatively small in amount. If we consider the\r\n  character of the substances discharged by different manufacturing\r\n  establishments, we shall find them very different. Some of them are\r\n  such as to be universally regarded as unfit to admit to any stream;\r\n  those, for instance, containing lead, arsenic, etc.; others, such\r\n  as salts of iron, are scarcely regarded as injurious; thus, the\r\n  discharge of sulphate of iron (copperas) into a stream already\r\n  polluted with sewage matter, might, within certain limits, be of\r\n  positive advantage. Again, in the case of some of the vegetable\r\n  dye-stuffs, the weak-spent dye liquors, although they communicate a\r\n  very foul appearance to the water for some distance, yet contain a\r\n  comparatively small amount of solid matter, and, if discharged into\r\n  a stream of considerable size, as soon as disseminated through it,\r\n  are diluted to a very great extent.\r\n\r\n  “Different in character, however, from much of the refuse of\r\n  manufacturing establishments is the sewage coming from dwellings,\r\n  or the sewage (in its more restricted sense of excremental matter\r\n  from animal sources) which comes from our manufactories. In fact,\r\n  this foul material, coming from establishments employing a large\r\n  number of operators, is likely, in many cases, to have a more\r\n  injurious effect upon the stream into which it is thrown than\r\n  refuse from the manufacturing operations. There are, however, some\r\n  branches of industry which discharge refuse material offensive and\r\n  dangerous to health. Such material is discharged from tanneries,\r\n  wool-pulling and hide-dressing establishments, slaughter-houses\r\n  and rendering-houses. ‘Too much stress can not be laid upon the\r\n  importance of preventing the discharge of such refuse.’”--(Prof.\r\n  Nichols, in Fifth Annual Report of Massachusetts State Board of\r\n  Health.)\r\n\r\n  “The discharge of gas works is known to kill fish and destroy lower\r\n  forms of animal life, which are important agents in preserving the\r\n  purity of fresh water.\r\n\r\n  “One would not assert that the drainage of a single house would\r\n  contaminate the water of a large river like the Merrimack so\r\n  as to make it unfit for domestic use, yet we must beware how\r\n  we depreciate the effect of sewage matter, even in a large\r\n  stream.”--(Prof. Nichols, in Fifth Annual Report of Massachusetts\r\n  State Board of Health, 1875.)\r\n\r\n  “With small amount of sewage the chances are favorable for the\r\n  action of atmospheric influences, and particles of undecomposed\r\n  material-propagating disease are rendered proportionally small,\r\n  owing to the great dilution.\r\n\r\n  “A minute quantity may do much harm, because it is now generally\r\n  believed, that it may hold the specific thing that propagates\r\n  specific diseases.\r\n\r\n  “Rice water evacuations, of a cholera patient, however much\r\n  diluted, still remains in liquid, although chemical test fails to\r\n  detect it.\r\n\r\n  “The carcass of a dead animal, thrown into a river or pond, and\r\n  confined there, so as not to be borne off bodily, gradually wastes\r\n  away, and, in a longer or shorter time, the main part of the\r\n  carcass has disappeared. What has become of it? A part has been\r\n  converted into gaseous products of decomposition, as the offensive\r\n  odors observed during the decay will testify; but another portion\r\n  has been carried off by the stream as soluble nitrogenous organic\r\n  matter. This nitrogenous matter would be detected a short distance\r\n  away, with greater or less ease, according to the volume of water\r\n  present; but in a stream of large size, or in a lake at no very\r\n  great distance from the source of contamination, it would be\r\n  impossible to discover any offensive matter. There is a limit to\r\n  the delicacy of our tests: there is a point beyond which, at the\r\n  present, we are not able to go. At the present time, a chemical\r\n  analysis alone is not sufficient to determine the desirability of\r\n  a given water-supply.”--(Rivers Pollution Commission, 1874.)\r\n\r\n  “The action of a float, upon or near the surface of the water, is\r\n  no indication of the movement, back and forth, of the sewage in\r\n  suspension. Portions of fresh sewage, it is true, will float, but\r\n  after maceration the sewage has a specific gravity of about 1.325,\r\n  and will sink, in still water, or very slow currents, at the rate\r\n  of one foot per minute; but in a current of 170 feet a minute, it\r\n  will not sink, but remain in suspension.”--(J. W. Adams, C. E.,\r\n  Water Supply Commission of Philadelphia, 1874.)\r\n\r\n  “This evidence, taken in connection with our own investigations,\r\n  appear to us, conclusively, to prove:\r\n\r\n  “1st. That there is, at certain times, in human excreta, some\r\n  material capable of producing disease, of a very fatal character,\r\n  in human subjects.\r\n\r\n  “2d. That this morbific matter can be detected only by its specific\r\n  action upon human subject, and can not be distinguished, either\r\n  by chemical or microscopical analysis, even in the concentrated\r\n  excreta, much less in water mixed with the excreta.\r\n\r\n  “3d. That, inasmuch as the organic matters of sewage are oxidized\r\n  and destroyed with extreme slowness in running water, there is\r\n  great probability that morbific matter will escape destruction and\r\n  be conveyed to great distances in rivers and streams.”--(Rivers\r\n  Pollution Commission, 1874.)\r\n\r\n  “Carbonates of calcium and lime produce temporary hardness; while\r\n  sulphate of lime and calcium and salts of magnesium produce\r\n  permanent hardness.\r\n\r\n  “Temporary hardness is objectionable for culinary and manufacturing\r\n  purposes, and excessive hardness is productive of disease known as\r\n  gravel. Magnesium salts are especially objectionable, because they\r\n  cause diarrhœa and dyspepsia. Goitre, or swelling of the glands and\r\n  cretinism, a kind of insanity, are charged to this impurity.\r\n\r\n  “Frequently, the water happens to be a little off color, especially\r\n  after a heavy storm, and the consumers get an idea that the water\r\n  is poisoned, and no amount of re-assuring will prove the reverse.\r\n  Such cases occurred in New York City, once or twice, during the\r\n  late war with the South. A little investigation will show the\r\n  absurdity of such a thing.\r\n\r\n  “One-sixteenth of a grain of strychnine is necessary to poison\r\n  a person. It would, therefore, require three and one-half tons\r\n  of strychnine to have poisoned the Croton water effectually--a\r\n  quantity not to be had in the world, and to procure it would take\r\n  about three years.\r\n\r\n  “If arsenic was desirable, two grains for each person would be\r\n  required, or 114 tons for the whole population of the city at that\r\n  time. Living animals, when seen under the microscope, are very\r\n  formidable in appearance and frightful in motion, yet they are not\r\n  objectionable. They only inhabit very pure water. It sometimes\r\n  happens, owing, perhaps, to some peculiarity of the season, that\r\n  these little animals multiply to such an extent as to produce\r\n  serious annoyance.\r\n\r\n  “It is stated that one-sixth of the deaths in Iceland are caused\r\n  by little animals being taken into the system. Young leeches,\r\n  contained in drinking water, sometimes fix themselves on the\r\n  pharynx. In Algiers, 400 French soldiers were sick at one time from\r\n  this cause.”--(From Prof. Foote’s lecture.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAMINATION OF WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nBoston water has become quite offensive from vegetable fermentation,\r\nsome say, although others attribute it to dead fish, eels, and animal\r\norganisms, and, later, to a green moss. The water tastes, at times,\r\nlike cucumbers. The present trouble is traced to the new “Sudbury”\r\nsupply. The older source, Lake Cochituate, is, however, contaminated\r\nby drainage from the town of Natick, through Pegan Pond.\r\n\r\nCroton water (New York supply) has, at times, suffered from dead fish\r\nand decayed leaves.\r\n\r\nHartford, Yonkers, Poughkeepsie, and Albany report the presence of\r\nmicroscopic plants and animals in their water, and these organisms\r\nindicate stagnation. “Any undue preponderance of animal or vegetable\r\nlife lead to the propagation of new forms of life dangerous to\r\nhealth.”\r\n\r\nSpringfield (Massachusetts) water tastes, at times, like green corn;\r\nwhile Cambridge is contaminated by the drainage of meadows.\r\n\r\nMr. G. W. Carpenter, Superintendent of Albany Water-Works, reports:\r\n\r\n  “There are two distinct causes (each imparting to the water an odor\r\n  and taste peculiar to itself) that have affected our reservoirs, at\r\n  different periods, during the last few years: the one giving to the\r\n  water the odor and taste of fish, the other imparting to it a musty\r\n  odor and taste sometimes detected in dead wood. In the former, it\r\n  is extremely difficult to satisfy consumers that the impurities\r\n  are not due solely to fish in the reservoir, while in the latter\r\n  they are equally confident that the reservoirs are little less than\r\n  stagnant ponds.”\r\n\r\nThe latter is sometimes exceedingly offensive and similar to\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen gas. In 1875 he again reports: “That all\r\nimpounded waters in this section of the country are liable to become\r\nimpure; that while the impurities have been traced to lower forms\r\nof animal organisms, little is known of the condition that favor\r\ntheir growth; that the germs of the organism probably come from the\r\natmosphere.”\r\n\r\nChicago will be compelled to move her crib further into the lake, now\r\ntwo miles from shore, to get beyond the limits of the Chicago River\r\nsewage.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, like Cincinnati, has outgrown its water system\r\n(established in 1872 at a cost of five millions,) and is obliged to\r\ndrink muddy water.\r\n\r\nCleveland extended its aqueduct in 1872, 1¼ miles into the lake in\r\norder to escape shore water.\r\n\r\nDetroit, after considerable discussion, removed their source of\r\nsupply three miles above the city, and constructed new works in\r\npreference to expending more money on the old works.\r\n\r\nRochester, N. Y., expended 4½ millions for bringing the water of\r\nHemlock Lake thirty miles to the city.\r\n\r\nBaltimore celebrated only last October the opening of their new\r\naqueduct, conveying the waters of Gunpowder River 7 miles in\r\ndistance, at a cost of over four millions.\r\n\r\nIndianapolis has been compelled to erect new works owing to the\r\ncontamination of the present source.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPURIFICATION OF WATERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rivers Pollution Commission of 1874, says, as regards filtration:\r\n“No process has yet been devised for cleaning surface water once\r\ncontaminated with sewage, so as to make it fit for drinking.” Others\r\nsay it is not safe to trust to dilution, storage, agitation, or\r\nfiltration for periods of time, for the complete removal from water\r\nof disease-producing elements whatever they may be.\r\n\r\nDr. Frankland states:\r\n\r\n  “I believe the noxious parts in sewage is that which is held in\r\n  mechanical suspension, not held in solution. I would not say it is\r\n  impossible to remove it, but no system of filtration will secure\r\n  its removal. There are only two processes by which it can be\r\n  effectually removed--one by boiling for a long time, and the other\r\n  by distillation.”\r\n\r\nThe methods adopted for filtration of water are:\r\n\r\n  “1. Infiltration--by intercepting underground currents through\r\n  natural formations of beds or banks of water-courses.\r\n\r\n  “2. Filtration--mechanically by artificial beds of sand, gravel,\r\n  etc., chemically by charcoal, iron, etc.\r\n\r\n  “3. Subsidence--clarification by deposition; storage reservoirs.\r\n\r\n  “4. Aeration--spontaneous purification by oxidation.\r\n\r\n  “5. Covered reservoirs--to prevent atmospheric influences.\r\n\r\n  “6. Precipitation of carbonates--Clark’s System.”\r\n\r\nThe infiltration system is resorted to where natural means for\r\npermeation are found; the galleries for intercepting the water being\r\nconstructed in the sand or gravel banks or bed.\r\n\r\nThe clarification, however, is necessarily restricted, owing to the\r\ngeneral high rate of filtration.\r\n\r\nLowell, Mass., has a gallery in the gravel banks of the Merrimack\r\nRiver, 1,300 feet in length, 8 feet by 8 feet, the bottom 8 feet\r\nbelow the river bed. The capacity is six million gallons, and rate of\r\nflow 150 gallons per square foot in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nLawrence, Mass., has a similar gallery.\r\n\r\nBrookline’s (Mass.) gallery is 762 feet in length; 6 feet below the\r\nriver bed. Rate of flow is 490 feet per square foot.\r\n\r\nNewark, N. J., tried the experiment of driven wells. They drove\r\nsixty-three-inch tubes 28 feet apart, 40 feet deep, into the bank of\r\nthe Passaic, three hundred feet from the shore line. The tubes were\r\nattached to three lines of suction pipes, and the latter united in\r\none twenty-four-inch main for the supply of their five million pump.\r\nAs their expectations as to the quality and quantity of water were\r\nnot realized, a well was substituted.\r\n\r\nColumbus, O., has a gallery under the Scioto River, 600 feet in\r\nlength, with a capacity of eight millions daily.\r\n\r\nToronto, Canada, has a basin excavated in an island of Lake Huron,\r\nopposite the city, 13½ feet below low water, and 3,090 feet in\r\nlength; the rate of flow is 52 imperial gallons per square foot for\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nLyons, France, has two covered galleries along the banks of the\r\nRhone; the area of bottoms 17,200 square feet; capacity six millions,\r\nand rate of flow at lowest stage 100 gallons per square foot.\r\n\r\nToulouse, France, has three covered galleries along the banks of\r\nthe Garonne River. The last gallery constructed is 1,180 feet long;\r\ncapacity, two and a half millions; rate of flow, 228 gallons per\r\nsquare foot of bottom area.\r\n\r\nPerth, Scotland, has a gallery in an island of the River Tay, 300\r\nfeet long, 4 feet wide by 8 feet high, 2½ feet below the surface of\r\nthe river; rate of flow, 182 gallons per square foot per diem.\r\n\r\nGenoa, Italy, has a gallery in the valley of the northern slope\r\nof the Mantine Alps, 1,181 feet above the sea level. It is 1,780\r\nfeet long, 5 feet wide and 7 to 8 feet high, and extends, in part,\r\nbeneath the bed of the river Scrivia, transversely from side to side,\r\nand in part along the bank. It has a delivery of 6,412 gallons for\r\ntwenty-four hours per lineal foot.\r\n\r\nThe city of Glasgow made two failures in attempting to furnish a\r\nsupply by this system. The first experiment was the construction of\r\na reservoir on the northern bank of the Clyde, below the level of\r\nthe river. Beneath the bottom of the reservoir was thirty-two-feet\r\ncylindrical tunnels made of wedged-shape bricks without mortar. The\r\nfailure was due to the inability to keep the interstices free from\r\nthe deposit of impurities. In the second plan, they excavated shallow\r\nwells, 10 feet in diameter, 6 feet deep, and 20 feet apart, in the\r\nstratum of sand adjacent to the river. The wells were connected by\r\npipes. The scheme was a worse failure than the first one.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, as in the case of Waltham, Massachusetts, in\r\nlocating these galleries, that spring water is intercepted in place\r\nof the desired water of the flowing stream. The difference in\r\ntemperature and increased hardness of the spring water, determine the\r\nclass of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILTRATION\r\n\r\nis the artificial method of clarification by mechanical and chemical\r\nmeans. By the mechanical system heavier impurities are held in\r\nsuspense by percolation of water through carefully prepared beds of\r\nsand, gravel, coke, shells, and like substances.\r\n\r\nThe total area of the London filter beds in 1874 was 68 acres, and\r\nrate of filtration per hour in inches and depth of water, or head on\r\nbeds, were:\r\n\r\n                            RATE.      DEPTH.\r\n\r\n  Lambeth Works           10 inches.   7 feet.\r\n  Southwark & Vauxhall     4   “       4   “\r\n  Grand Junction           3   “       4   “\r\n  West Middlesex           4   “       3   “\r\n  Chelsea                  6   “       5   “\r\n  New River                4½  “       5   “\r\n  East London              3   “       5   “\r\n\r\nThe efficiency of filtration is inversely to rate of flow. Humber\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n  “It is now generally admitted that filtration through sand, to be\r\n  effective, should not proceed at a higher rate than 6 inches of\r\n  descent per hour; or, in other words, there should be at least 1½\r\n  square yards of filtering area for each 1,000 gallons per day. This\r\n  is, of course, exclusive of reserve area, which will be necessary\r\n  to permit of at least one bed being cleansed while sufficient area\r\n  remains in operation in the other beds.”\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of these beds enhance the cost of supplying water,\r\nbecause they must be cleansed frequently--in some cases once a week.\r\nThe regulation and control of the water consumption is an important\r\nconsideration, that the rate of increase will be proportioned to the\r\ngrowth of the city; and not, as in this country, an unaccountable\r\nrapid increase due to the profligate use of water that makes\r\nfiltration impossible. Over eleven-twelfths of the water supplied to\r\nLondon is filtered with the following efficiency:\r\n\r\n  =======================+=======================+=======================\r\n                         |  BEFORE FILTRATION.   |   AFTER FILTRATION.\r\n                         +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n                         |  ORGANIC  |  ORGANIC  |  ORGANIC  |  ORGANIC\r\n                         |  CARBON.  | NITROGEN. |  CARBON.  | NITROGEN.\r\n                         +-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n                         |In parts of|In parts of|In parts of|In parts of\r\n                         | 100,000.  | 100,000.  | 100,000.  | 100,000.\r\n  -----------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n  West Middlesex Works   |   .209    |   .071    |   .198    |   .043\r\n  Grand Junction Works   |   .262    |   .042    |   .231    |   .032\r\n  Southwark & Vauxhall,  |           |           |           |\r\n         Hampton Works   |   .321    |   .063    |   .273    |   .042\r\n         Battersea “     |   .239    |   .047    |   .226    |   .035\r\n  Lambeth Works          |   .273    |   .067    |   .258    |   .038\r\n  Chelsea Works          |   .325    |   .076    |   .258    |   .032\r\n  New River, Lea River   |   .287    |   .067    |     --    |     --\r\n      “      New River   |   .375    |   .059    |   .227    |   .043\r\n      “          “       |   .350    |   .084    |   .246    |   .042\r\n  East London Co.,       |           |           |           |\r\n         Lea Water       |   .363    |   .082    |     --    |     --\r\n         Waltham St. Res |   .481    |   .092    |   .305    |   .041\r\n         Thames Water    |     --    |     --    |   .159    |   .030\r\n  -----------------------+-----------+-----------+-----------+-----------\r\n\r\nDimensions of filter beds for given volumes (from Fanning):\r\n\r\n  For  1  million gallons per diem 3 beds  60 feet × 100 feet.\r\n  For  2     “       “       “     3  “    80  “   × 150   “\r\n  For  3     “       “       “     3  “   100  “   × 180   “\r\n  For  4½    “       “       “     4  “   100  “   × 180   “\r\n  For  6     “       “       “     4  “   100  “   × 240   “\r\n  For  8     “       “       “     4  “   120  “   × 270   “\r\n  For 10     “       “       “     5  “   120  “   × 270   “\r\n\r\nAnalysis of sand from filter beds (in 100,000 parts)\r\n\r\n                                        ORGANIC   ORGANIC   ORGANIC\r\n                                        MATTER.

Dr. Gunning’s experiment of the waters of the River Maas, by\r\n  reducing the turbidity with .032 gramme of perchloride of iron into\r\n  one litre of water.\r\n\r\n  3. Dr. Bischoff’s (Jr.) process of removing organic matter by\r\n  spongy iron, prepared by heating hydrated oxide of iron with carbon.\r\n\r\n  4. Spencer’s process of sand filtration with crushed grains of\r\n  a carbide of iron. The carbide, it is claimed, does not require\r\n  frequent removal.\r\n\r\n  5. Sheet-iron strips placed in water decomposes organic matter\r\n  rapidly. It is recommended by eminent authority.\r\n\r\n  6.

In the case of a\r\n  large reservoir, holding many days’ supply, it is quite different.\r\n  Time is then afforded for the heavier impurities to settle to\r\n  the bottom; and, if the water is admitted at one end and taken\r\n  out at the other end of the reservoir, very little, if any, of\r\n  the heavier particles can pass into the circulation; and we can\r\n  see no reason why any of the superficial impurities, such as\r\n  remain on or near the surface, should ever be allowed to enter\r\n  the circulation.”--(From Water Supply Commission of Engineers,\r\n  Philadelphia, 1875.)\r\n\r\nFanning says:\r\n\r\n  “Subsidence does not completely clarify the water even in a\r\n  fortnight or three weeks’ time.”\r\n\r\nLondon has 262 acres of subsiding reservoirs for removing the\r\nturbidity of the Thames and Lea Rivers, and used as storage at times\r\nof sudden freshets.\r\n\r\nMere exposure to the air, even if accompanied by violent agitation,\r\nis comparatively powerless for the removal of polluting organic\r\nmatter from water. Although, however, the flow of a river has thus\r\nbut little effect in purifying the water by the oxidation of the\r\ndissolved organic matters, it has a most material influence in\r\nthe removal by subsidence of a large proportion of the suspended\r\nimpurities both organic and mineral, especially if the flow be\r\nsluggish in places.\r\n\r\nIn passing through still pools, the turbid streams let fall its\r\nload of grosser mechanically suspended particles, and thus the water\r\nbecomes clearer, although the dissolved impurity remains nearly as\r\ngreat as ever. It is, doubtless, this clarification by subsidence\r\nwhich has led to the very general but erroneous belief in the rapid\r\nself-purifying power of running water.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF SUBSIDENCE.\r\n\r\n  ===============================+===============================\r\n                                 | SUBSIDENCE FROM 100,000 PARTS.\r\n              RIVERS             +----------+----------+---------\r\n                                 |  MINERAL |  ORGANIC |  TOTAL\r\n                                 |  MATTER. |  MATTER. |  SOLIDS.\r\n  -------------------------------+----------+----------+---------\r\n  Irwell, after flow of 11 miles |    .88   |    .48   |    1.36\r\n  Irwell, after flow of 11 miles |    .38   |    .84   |    1.22\r\n  Mersey, after flow of 13 miles |    .10   |    .04   |     .14\r\n  Darwin, after flow of 13 miles |    .54   |   1.42   |    1.96\r\n  -------------------------------+----------+----------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF SUBSIDENCE.\r\n\r\n  ===============================+===============================\r\n                                 |     PER CENT OF REDUCTION\r\n                                 |    OF MATTER IN SUSPENSION.\r\n              RIVERS             +----------+----------+---------\r\n                                 |  MINERAL |  ORGANIC |  TOTAL\r\n                                 |  MATTER. |  MATTER. |  SOLIDS.\r\n  -------------------------------+----------+----------+---------\r\n  Irwell, after flow of 11 miles |   47.8   |   50.    |   48.6\r\n  Irwell, after flow of 11 miles |   14.3   |   30.9   |   22.7\r\n  Mersey, after flow of 13 miles |   10.6   |   13.3   |   11.3\r\n  Darwin, after flow of 13 miles |   30.3   |   79.8   |   55.1\r\n  -------------------------------+----------+----------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\nAERATION\r\n\r\nis the destruction of animate life by oxidation, and is best\r\naccomplished by placing weirs across streams, sheet flashing, or\r\nspreading of water in thin sheets, or by roughness of beds or banks\r\nof running waters. The benefits may be ascertained, chemically, by\r\nthe presence of nitrates and nitrites. The Water Supply Commission of\r\nEngineers, for the investigation of the water system of Philadelphia,\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n  “This is one of nature’s processes for purifying water, not only\r\n  of the land, but of the ocean, and bodies of water deprived of it,\r\n  other processes are apt to set in. It is, therefore, desirable\r\n  that nothing should be done to obstruct this beneficial action.\r\n  We have been informed that the cutting of ice, which was formerly\r\n  allowed on the Fairmount pool, has been prohibited or discontinued.\r\n  We would especially recommend that the cutting of ice on the pool\r\n  be resumed, as an important sanitary measure, on account of the\r\n  aeration it will afford. If this were done systematically, it\r\n  might remedy, at least to some extent, the disagreeable odor which\r\n  we learn is sometimes noticed during the winter.”\r\n\r\nThe aeration adopted by Mr. Moore, Supt. of Cincinnati Water Works,\r\nat Eden reservoir, improved the purity of the water twenty per cent.,\r\nas shown by the analysis of Prof. Stuntz, who recommends the adoption\r\nof the process on a larger scale.\r\n\r\n_Covered Reservoirs_, although used by the ancients, are now being\r\nrecommended as highly beneficial to the purity of the water, by\r\ndepriving the organic germs of their propagation elements of light\r\nand heat of the sun, preventing freezing of water, and reducing\r\nevaporation to a minimum. Paris has two such structures. Chelsea\r\n(London) Water-Works has one of ten million capacity that cost\r\n$110,000.00.\r\n\r\nThe temporary hardness of water is produced by absorption of\r\ncarbonates, and may be reduced to softness by:\r\n\r\n  Distillation,\r\n  Carbonate of soda,\r\n  Boiling,\r\n  Caustic lime.\r\n\r\nPermanent hardness is produced by sulphates, chlorides and nitrates\r\nof lime, and magnesia, and can not be dissipated by boiling.\r\n\r\nAn imperial gallon of pure water can take up but about two grains of\r\ncarbonate of lime, but the presence of carbonic acid in the water\r\nwill enable the same 70,000 grains (an imperial gallon) to take up\r\ntwelve, sixteen, twenty, or more grains of the carbonate, and for\r\neach grain so taken up is one degree of hardness by the Clarke scale.\r\n\r\nThe system patented by Dr. Clarke, of England, in 1856, is the most\r\npractical method for the precipitation of lime, effected by means\r\nof a dilution of water with slaked lime, in the proportion of one\r\nof lime-water to ten of hard water. The system is in use in several\r\nsmall places in England, notably Canterbury, where 100,000 gallons\r\nare reduced, daily, at a cost of twenty-seven shillings per million\r\ngallons, with the following results:\r\n\r\n           TOTAL SOLID IMPURITIES.

The new owners, however, abandoned it.\r\n\r\nFrom the testimony of a number of reputable physicians, before the\r\nRivers Pollution Commission, of 1874, hard water, to a limited\r\nextent, ten degrees, was not considered injurious, and, by some,\r\nabsolutely beneficial to health, although soft water, for a general\r\nwater supply, was preferable.\r\n\r\nMr. Homersham, C. E., the designer of several of these works,\r\ntestified, before this commission, that it cost £1, 7s. for\r\nprecipitating 1,000,000 gallons. To introduce this system into\r\nLondon, with a consumption of 100,000,000 daily, the cost, he says,\r\nwould be $3,000,000 for plant, and requiring over thirty-three acres\r\nof ground for basins, etc.\r\n\r\nThe relative sanitary condition of cities, in the United Kingdom,\r\nusing hard and soft water, is shown in the following table:\r\n\r\n                    AVERAGE          CHARACTER          AVERAGE RATE\r\n  NO.

They say that one ounce of\r\nlime, when added to thirty-six gallons of water, make it superior,\r\nfor washing purposes, to the rain-water usually obtained from the\r\ncistern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSYSTEM OF SUPPLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe systems of supply may be arranged under three general heads, viz:\r\n\r\n  1st. By springs and wells.\r\n  2d.  By gravitation.\r\n  3d.  By pumping.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRINGS AND WELLS.\r\n\r\nWe have, under this name, nature’s resources for supplying our wants,\r\nwhose facilities for furnishing the requisite supply depend upon\r\nthe local rain-fall, configuration of the land, and the nature, or\r\ngeological formation, of surface and subsoils.\r\n\r\nLand springs are fed by rain-water, gravitating through loose\r\npermeable soils. The waters are very readily affected by infiltration\r\nof surrounding soils, and their course so easily changed in any\r\ndirection that the permanence of such a source can not be relied upon.\r\n\r\nDeep springs are fed by the waters falling upon and soaking down to\r\ngreat depths, and find their way to the surface through some fault,\r\nupheaval or other great geological disturbance, or between some\r\nimpermeable strata. The most copious springs are in the tertiary\r\nstrata, and the law, as regards their abundance, is “the rarer the\r\nvisible springs may be, the more copious they would be found.” The\r\npermanence of the springs can only be relied upon after careful\r\ngauging, extending over several years.\r\n\r\nWells may be separated under the following divisions:\r\n\r\n  Shallow, or dug wells.\r\n  Ordinary deep, or pump wells.\r\n  Artesian wells.\r\n\r\n  “Shallow and deep wells are those which are sunk through a\r\n  permeable stratum, and form, as it were, reservoirs, into which\r\n  the land springs may filter and accumulate; whilst artesian wells\r\n  are those which are sunk through an impervious upper stratum, to\r\n  reach a subterranean water-bearing stratum lying, in its turn, upon\r\n  an impervious upholding bed. In the former cases, the quantity of\r\n  water obtainable is simply that which can filter through the sides\r\n  of the well to replace the water removed, or which may accumulate\r\n  in any reservoir formed below; whilst, in the latter case, the\r\n  quantity obtainable will depend simply upon the power of the\r\n  water-bearing stratum to transmit water.\r\n\r\n  “In the case of deep-seated wells, the probable yield of water\r\n  must depend, primarily, upon the area of permeable strata likely\r\n  to affect the supply, and upon the facilities those strata may\r\n  offer for the passage of water; and, secondly, upon the rate of\r\n  consumption which takes place in the neighborhood, for the quantity\r\n  of water which any particular stratum can supply is only a limited\r\n  quantity; so that, evidently, if the water be taken at one point,\r\n  no more will remain for the other.”--(Hydraulic Engineering,\r\n  Weale’s Series.)\r\n\r\nThe above fact is illustrated, practically, in London, where the\r\nwater line of the chalk formation has been permanently lowered to\r\nthe extent of fifty or sixty feet below Trinity high-water mark;\r\nand it is even stated that the level of the water in the wells,\r\nnear the summit of this formation, rises, on the Monday morning, in\r\nconsequence of the cessation of pumping in London during the Sundays.\r\nThe experience of Liverpool corroborates this fact: that the Windsor\r\nwell, having a depth of 210 feet, affected the surrounding wells\r\nto a maximum distance of a mile and three quarters. The celebrated\r\nengineer and originator of the well system of Liverpool, Robert\r\nStephenson, from long experience and careful observation, offered the\r\nfollowing conclusions (from Hughes water-works):\r\n\r\n  “That an abundance of water is stored up in the new red sandstone,\r\n  and may be obtained, by sinking shafts and driving tunnels, about\r\n  the level of low water.\r\n\r\n  “That the sandstone is generally very pervious, admitting of deep\r\n  wells drawing their supply from distances exceeding one mile.\r\n\r\n  “That the permeability of the sandstone is occasionally interfered\r\n  with by faults or fissures filled with argillaceous matter,\r\n  sometimes rendering them partially, or wholly, water-tight.\r\n\r\n  “That neither by sinking, tunneling, nor boring, can the yield of\r\n  any well be very materially and permanently increased, except so\r\n  far as the contributing area may be thereby enlarged.\r\n\r\n  “That the contributing area to any given well is limited by the\r\n  amount of friction experienced by the movement of the water through\r\n  the fissures and pores of the sandstone; and\r\n\r\n  “That there is little or no probability of obtaining, permanently,\r\n  more than about 1,000,000 or 1,200,000 gallons a day from each\r\n  well, and this only when not interfered with by other deep wells.”\r\n\r\nStatistics of the flow of the Windsor well show that the yield, in\r\n1843, was 1,152,000 gallons per day; in May, 1848, 807,061 gallons;\r\nin January, 1850, from 705,667 to 634,752 gallons. The observations\r\nof the Green Lane well, in the same city, give the decrease in flow,\r\nper annum, at 4.7 to 6 per cent.\r\n\r\nA plan has been proposed, by Mr. Bailey Denton, that, in order to\r\nincrease the water-bearing stratum under London, sufficiently for\r\na water supply, and also secure the well-known benefits of the\r\nfiltration powers of the chalk, to let the Thames water pass down to\r\nthe chalk, through the London clay, by means of wells sunk or bored.\r\nThe objections raised against this plan is the possibility of the\r\nwells becoming choked by accumulation of impurities.\r\n\r\nMr. J. T. Fanning in his valuable “Treatise on Water Supply\r\nEngineering,” says:\r\n\r\n  “The success of wells, penetrating deep into large subterranean\r\n  basins, upon the first completion, has usually led to their\r\n  duplication at other points within the same basin, and the flow of\r\n  the first has often been materially checked upon the commencement\r\n  of flow in the second, and both again upon the commencement of\r\n  flow in a third, though neither was within one mile of either of\r\n  the others. The flow of the famous well at Grenelle was seriously\r\n  checked by the opening of another well at more than three thousand\r\n  yards, or nearly two miles distant.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLLUTION OF WELL WATER.\r\n\r\nIt is stated that about fifteen millions of the British population\r\nlive in towns and urban districts. Even if we assume, which is not\r\nyet the case, that all these people are supplied by water-works, the\r\nremaining twelve millions of county population derive their water\r\nalmost exclusively from shallow wells, and these are, so far as our\r\nexperience extends, almost always horribly polluted by sewage and by\r\nanimal matter of the most disgusting origin.\r\n\r\nAs the contents of the water-hole or well are pumped out, they are\r\nimmediately replenished from the surrounding disgusting mixture, and\r\nit is not therefore very surprising to be assured that such wells\r\ndo not become dry even in summer. Unfortunately, excrementitious\r\nliquids, especially after they have soaked through a few feet of\r\nporous soil, do not impair the palatability of water; and this\r\npolluted liquid is consumed from year to year without a suspicion of\r\nits character.\r\n\r\nOur acquaintance with a very large portion of this class of potable\r\nwaters, has been in consequence of the occurrence of severe outbreaks\r\nof typhoid fever amongst consumers of this character of water.\r\n\r\n  “The samples of water from deep unpolluted wells were obtained\r\n  from wells or bore-holes of a depth rarely less than 100 feet,\r\n  and reaching in one case 1,285 feet. In many cases these wells\r\n  were partly or wholly supplied by surface-polluted water. Such\r\n  water, when it penetrates only to shallow wells still retains a\r\n  considerable proportion of its polluting organic matter in an\r\n  unoxidized condition: but when it descends through one hundred\r\n  feet or upwards of porous soil or rock, the exhausted filtration\r\n  to which it has been subjected in passing downwards through so\r\n  great a thickness of material, and the rapid oxidation of the\r\n  dissolved organic matters in a porous and aerated medium, afford\r\n  a considerable guarantee that all noxious constituents have been\r\n  removed.”--(Rivers Pollution Commission, 1874.)\r\n\r\n  “Deep wells may become polluted, either by admission of soakage\r\n  from the superficial strata into the shaft of the well, or by\r\n  access of polluted water through open fissures in the rock in which\r\n  the well is sunk.”--(Rivers Pollution Commission, 1874.)\r\n\r\n  “Even where wells are sunk to great distance (one was sunk at\r\n  Bondy, near Paris, to a depth of 247 feet), the surrounding soil is\r\n  not free from danger of pollution by the soaking of the foul liquid\r\n  into the side of the well.”--(Fifth report Massachusetts State\r\n  Board of Health.)\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the average analysis of ten worst examples\r\nof well water (parts in 100,000 parts):\r\n\r\n                          AV.

It was first practiced in 1100, in\r\nprovince of Artois, France, whence it derives its name.\r\n\r\n  “The second and tertiary geological formations, such as those\r\n  underneath London and Paris, often present the appearance of\r\n  immense basins; the boundary or rim of the basin having been formed\r\n  by an upheaval of the subjacent strata. In these formations it\r\n  often happens that a porous stratum, consisting of sand, sandstone,\r\n  chalk, and other calcareous matter, is included between two\r\n  impermeable layers of clay, so as to form a flat, porous ‘U’ tube,\r\n  continuous from side to side of the valley, the outcrop on the\r\n  surrounding hills forming the mouth of the tube. The rain filtering\r\n  down the porous layer to the bottom of the basin, forms there a\r\n  subterranean pore, which, with the liquid or semi-liquid column\r\n  pressing upon it, constitutes a sort of huge natural hydrostatic\r\n  bellows; sometimes the pressure on the superincumbent crust is so\r\n  great as to cause an upheaval or disturbance of the valley, and\r\n  there can be little doubt that many earthquakes that are manifestly\r\n  not of volcanic origin, are due to this simple cause.”--(Ninth\r\n  edition Encyclopedia Britannica.)\r\n\r\n  “An overflow results only when the surface that supplies the\r\n  water-bearing stratum is at an elevation superior to the surface\r\n  of the ground where the well is located, and the water-bearing\r\n  stratum is confined between impervious strata. In such cases the\r\n  hydrostatic pressure from the higher source forces the water up to\r\n  the mouth of the bore.”--(Fanning Water Supply.)\r\n\r\n  “In the tertiary formations the porous layers are not so thick as\r\n  in the secondary, and, consequently, the occurrence of underground\r\n  lakes is not on so grand a scale; but there being more frequent\r\n  attenuation of these sandy beds, we find a greater number of them,\r\n  and often a series of natural fountains may be obtained in the same\r\n  valley preceding from water-bearing strata at different depths, and\r\n  rising to different heights.\r\n\r\n  “It does not follow that all the essentials for an Artesian well\r\n  are present, though two impermeable strata, with a porous one\r\n  between, may crop out around a basin. There must be, in the first\r\n  place, continuity of the permeable bed for the uninterrupted\r\n  passage of the water, and there must be, on the other hand, no flaw\r\n  or breach in either of the confining layers by which the water\r\n  might escape. To one or the other of the causes is due the failure\r\n  of many attempts to find Artesian wells, where, from appearances,\r\n  they might be expected. It has occasionally happened that on\r\n  deepening the bore, with the hope of increasing the flow of water,\r\n  it has ceased altogether, doubtless from the lower confining layer\r\n  being pierced, and the water allowed to escape by another outlet.\r\n\r\n  “The subterranean bore is frequently of small extent, and of the\r\n  nature of a channel rather than of a broad sheet of water; and the\r\n  existence of one spring is no guarantee that another will be found\r\n  by merely boring to the same depth in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n  “The preliminary theoretical determination of the existence of\r\n  these Artesian conditions is in itself a difficult matter, and can\r\n  be arrived at only by a thorough acquaintance with the geological\r\n  disposition of the district.”--(Ninth edition Encyclopedia\r\n  Britannica.)\r\n\r\n  “The question of a supply of water from deep wells, made by\r\n  boring, and commonly called artesian, has been somewhat discussed\r\n  in Philadelphia, but there is no probability that an adequate\r\n  supply, for the general use of the city could be obtained in that\r\n  manner; and the quality of the water obtained from such wells\r\n  varies very much in different localities, depending upon the\r\n  nature of the strata from which the water is procured, and this\r\n  Commission can not recommend any dependence upon such plans for\r\n  the general city supply, attended, as they are, with great expense\r\n  and extreme uncertainty, and being, in every case, more or less\r\n  experimental.”--(Philadelphia Water Supply Commission of Engineers,\r\n  1875.)\r\n\r\nThe flowing water of the Kissingen spring, Bavaria, is produced by\r\ncarbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE OF WELLS.\r\n\r\nInvariably the temperature of water from great depths is higher than\r\nat the surface, this being due to some unknown source of heat in the\r\ninterior of the globe.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland, the rate of increase of temperature, after permanent\r\ndegree has been attained, is about one degree Fahrenheit for every\r\nforty-eight feet of descent.\r\n\r\nAt Grenelle, the temperature was found to be 1.8 degrees for every\r\n106 feet of descent below the point of constant temperature.\r\n\r\nThe average rate of increase of temperature is one degree for a\r\ndescent of from forty to fifty feet.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the boring at Columbus increased, below the\r\npermanent line, one degree in every seventy-one feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF ARTESIAN WELLS.\r\n\r\nThe famous well at Grenelle, France, was commenced, by the\r\ngovernment, in 1834, and after repeated failures and discouragements\r\nalmost to abandonment, notwithstanding the urgent representations\r\nof the scientist Arago, that water would be found, the end was\r\naccomplished at the depth of 1,798 feet, in the year 1843. The\r\ndiameter of the bore is 3½ inches; capacity, 600 gallons per minute;\r\ntemperature of water, 82 degrees; height of flow, 128 feet. The\r\nexpense attending this boring was 300,000 francs. The Passy well,\r\nnear Paris, supplied from the same water-bearing stratum of the\r\nGrenelle, is 1,923 feet deep; 2′ 4″ inches bore at bottom; capacity,\r\n5,582,000 gallons per day; height of flow, 54 feet. The La Chapelle\r\nwell was started in 1866, with a gigantic bore of five feet seven\r\ninches, and by November, 1869, had reached a depth of 1,811 feet,\r\nthe intention of the engineer being to extend it to a depth of 2,950\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nAt the part of Paris named Butte-aux-Caelles, a well was started, in\r\n1866, of six and a half feet diameter, to be carried down to a depth\r\nof 2,600 to 2,900 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Kent Water-Works, of London, is supplied by wells in the chalk\r\nformation, yielding 9,000,000 gallons daily. This great flow is due\r\nto what is known as a fault in the London basin strata.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis has a well 3,147 feet deep.\r\n\r\nLouisville has a three-inch well, 2,086 feet deep, with a capacity\r\nsame as the Grenelle well.\r\n\r\nThere have been nine artesian wells successfully bored in Cincinnati,\r\na description of which will be found on page 107.\r\n\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, has an artesian well 1,970 feet deep,\r\nfrom which pure soft water, of 90° temperature, flows ninety feet\r\nabove the surface. It has five inch tubing on top and two and\r\nthree-fourths inch diameter at bottom. The cost was $2,500.00, and\r\nthe time required in sinking was a little more than a year. There\r\nis also an artesian well, in the same city, 1,250 feet deep, which\r\ndischarges 25,000 gallons a day, of water, at a temperature of\r\neighty-eight degrees, strongly impregnated with sodium and magnesium.\r\n\r\nThe desert of Sahara has a number of well borings, some yielding as\r\nhigh as 1,500,000 gallons daily. The depth varies from 130 to 400\r\nfeet, and temperature 70 to 77 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio State authorities undertook to supply the capital by an\r\nartesian well. After two failures, in attempting to tube out the\r\nquicksand, they succeeded (in November, 1857) in piercing through\r\nthe rock, and at a depth of 149 feet a vein of water was struck that\r\ncontinued to wash away the borings for nearly 100 feet below. On\r\nthe 1st of October, 1870, a depth of 2,775 feet was reached, but no\r\nflowing water obtained, when the undertaking was abandoned for want\r\nof an appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe record of the boring is tabulated as follows:\r\n\r\n  ---+-------------+------------+------------------------------+----------\r\n     |  SYSTEM.    |   GROUP.   |          STRATA.             |THICKNESS.\r\n  ---+-------------+------------+------------------------------+----------\r\n     |             |            |                              |  FEET.\r\n   1 | Drift.      |  Alluvial  | Clay, sand, and gravel.      |   123\r\n     |             |   drift.   |                              |\r\n     |             |            |                              |\r\n     |           { |  Base of   |                              |\r\n   2 | Devonian. { | Hamilton.  | Dark bituminous shale.       |    15\r\n     |           { | Helderberg.| Dark and gray limestone with |\r\n     |             |            |   bands of chert.            |\r\n     |             |            |                              |\r\n     |           { |  Niagara.  | Sandy above, darker and      |   626\r\n   3 |  Upper    { |            |   argillaceous below.        |\r\n   4 | Silurian. { |  Clinton.  | Red, brown, and gray shales  |   162\r\n     |           { |            |     and marls.               |\r\n     |             |            |                              |\r\n     |           { |   Hudson   |                              |\r\n   5 |Lower      { |  Trenton.  | Greenish calcareous shale.   |  1058\r\n   6 |Silurian.  { |Calciferous.| Light drab sandy magnesian   |   475\r\n   7 |           { |            |   limestones.                |\r\n     |           { |  Potsdam.  | White sand-rock, calcareous. |   316\r\n  ---+-------------+------------+------------------------------+----------\r\n\r\nTemperature of well at bottom, 88 degrees, being uniform for 90\r\nfeet, at 53 degrees, will make an increase of one degree for every\r\nadditional 71 feet. It was the opinion of Prof. Newberry, that, if\r\nwater was successfully struck, it would be of a saline character.\r\n\r\nDubuque, Iowa, is supplied by a spring accidentally struck while\r\ntunneling in a neighboring drift.\r\n\r\nAt the upper basin of the Thames River there are seven springs, whose\r\ncapacity is estimated at 32,000,000 gallons daily.\r\n\r\nLiverpool, England, has four wells, with a combined capacity of\r\n6,000,000 gallons daily.\r\n\r\nBirmingham, England, has four wells, from which the water company\r\nderives 8,000,000 gallons daily.\r\n\r\nWashington has over 400 wells, and Cincinnati about 300, nine of\r\nwhich are artesian, that were bored by private enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe deepest well in the world is near Berlin--4194 feet deep without\r\npiercing the salt formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWELL BORING.\r\n\r\nThe art of boring into the earth was practiced by the Chinese 2,000\r\nyears ago, the feature of their system being the percussive action of\r\na tool suspended by a flexible rope.\r\n\r\nThe system now practiced in Great Britain, and on the Continent,\r\nis that in which the tools are attached to rods, consisting of a\r\nnumber of lengths, from ten to thirty feet long, joined by a separate\r\ncollar, with a combined vertical and definite rotary motion, produced\r\nby a swivel joint in the upper length, or by suspending the rod to a\r\n“dog.” An ordinary well is first sunk to such a depth that the water\r\nbelow will rise, through the boring, into it. The object is to partly\r\nfacilitate the object of boring, but chiefly to enable the pumps\r\nto be fixed without too great a length of suction. In deep wells,\r\nwindlasses, driven by steam power, are used for operating the tool;\r\nthe size of rod being, usually, 1¼ inch square; but for an eight\r\nfoot boring, a 4½ inch square rod was used. To reduce the jarring\r\nand vibration, where borings are of considerable depth, the rods are\r\nhollow, in order to give same rigidity and resistance to torsion with\r\nless weight, and made buoyant, when working in water, by filling\r\nthe rod with cork or light wood. A sliding joint, known as the\r\n“Oëuyenhausen joint,” is frequently used to bring the jarring only\r\non that portion of the boring rod below. A shell pump is employed,\r\nin combination with the boring tool, for gathering the detritus,\r\nwhich obviates frequent raising of rod. Free-falling tools, guided by\r\nsliding joint, with catch or pall to raise same, are largely used.\r\nThe weight of tool depends upon the depth and character of boring,\r\nthat of the La Chapelle well being four tons.\r\n\r\nIn the oil-well boring of Pennsylvania, the rope (with about 50 feet\r\nof iron bar, sliding jaws, sinking bar, flat drill and sand pump\r\nattached) are exclusively preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL EXAMPLES OF WELLS AS SOURCES OF SUPPLY ONLY.\r\n\r\nWhere the surface soil and underlying drift possess sufficient\r\nporous qualities for absorption of a large portion of the rain-fall,\r\ntogether with the natural benefits of the impervious stratum beneath,\r\nhaving a proper axis of inclination favorable for conducting the\r\ninfiltration of adjoining water-sheds, a large supply of water may\r\nbe secured by the construction of dug wells for intercepting the\r\nsubterraneous water.\r\n\r\nFanning has computed the following available quantities, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, for percolation, from one square mile of\r\nporous gathering area (the mean annual rain being assumed at forty\r\ninches depth).\r\n\r\n           RATIO OF 1-12 OF   VOLUME OF PERCOLATION   NO.

The\r\nsource is the southern slope of Long Island, with a drainage area\r\nof 60.25 square miles. The plain is composed of fine sand, which is\r\nsaturated with excellent water, the surface of which rises twelve\r\nfeet per mile from the tide level at the shore, and which appears at\r\nthe surface of the ground in springs and streams, where depressions\r\noccur in the ground level. The minimum observed flow occurred in\r\n1880, and was equal to 9.4 inches on the water-shed. The available\r\nsupply is, at times, quite small.\r\n\r\nThe city of Lynn uses a driven well partly, of which they say, in\r\ntheir annual report for 1880:\r\n\r\n  “The doubtful character of any underground supply of water,\r\n  especially when it is drawn from beneath a territory occupied by\r\n  a densely settled community, makes frequent examination of its\r\n  quality a duty not to be disregarded. We invite attention, however,\r\n  to the fact that the chemical examination of the well water has\r\n  shown an increasing quantity of foreign matter mingling with it as\r\n  pumping proceeded, and that this increase suggests an inflow of\r\n  water to the wells from some other source than that from which it\r\n  was at first drawn.”\r\n\r\nThis method of securing water, however, is largely resorted to in the\r\norigin of water-works for small cities.\r\n\r\nThe Sanitary Engineer (Vol. v, No. 5) refers to a proposed well for\r\nLincoln, Nebraska, a town of 15,000 inhabitants, that the contractor\r\nproposed to dig for the sum of $10,000. The estimated capacity will\r\nbe ten million gallons a day, and the editor of the paper observes:\r\n\r\n  “If a large well is sunk in a very saturated and porous soil, it\r\n  will probably furnish the amount required for the city (one million\r\n  gallons) at first, possibly a great deal more. But in five years’\r\n  time it is not hazardous to predict that such a well will not yield\r\n  enough water for Lincoln. As for furnishing ten million gallons a\r\n  day for any length of time, there is no well in the world, which\r\n  we know of, of such a capacity, and all experience is against the\r\n  probability of such an one being discovered.”\r\n\r\n\r\nGRAVITATION\r\n\r\nis that system of supply where the rain-water drainage of elevated\r\nwater-sheds is gathered in natural or artificial storage basins, and\r\nconveyed through conduits by gravitation to the point of supply. The\r\nimportant points entering into the consideration of this method are:\r\n\r\n  1. Character of water; present and future contamination.\r\n\r\n  2. Water-shed; present and future requirements for quantity\r\n  and availability, with proper knowledge of the geology of the\r\n  surrounding country.\r\n\r\n  3. Rain-fall, absorption and evaporation.\r\n\r\n  4. Elevation and distance of source.\r\n\r\n  5. Route of conduit.\r\n\r\n  6. Cost of construction.\r\n\r\nThe practical objections to the system are:\r\n\r\n  1. Contamination of source by surface drainage of cultivated lands;\r\n  pollution of feeding streams, or growth of vegetation.\r\n\r\n  2. Necessity for large impounding reservoirs for storage of water\r\n  during rainy seasons, requiring immense puddled walls, whose\r\n  stability is questioned.\r\n\r\n  3. The uncertainty of dependence on the requisite rain-fall, and\r\n  liability of short supply, or a possibility of water-famine.\r\n\r\n  4. The large expenditure at the outstart for construction of supply\r\n  that must be ample for future demands.\r\n\r\nSurface waters from calcareous cultivated lands are polluted with but\r\na moderate amount of organic matter; but, as some of this matter is\r\nalmost always of animal origin, they are always undesirable, and may\r\nat any time become dangerous for domestic use.\r\n\r\nIf necessity compels their use, great care ought to be taken to\r\nsecure their efficient filtration before they are delivered to\r\nconsumers. This affords some, though by no means complete, protection\r\nfrom the propagation of zymotic disease through the agency of such\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nThey are generally very hard, and, unless artificially softened,\r\noccasion a great waste of soap when used for washing. Of all the\r\nwaters of this description, those which flow from the surface, or\r\nfrom the drains of sewage farms, are generally most impure, because\r\nthe time during which the foul sewage is exposed to the purifying\r\naction of plant and soil is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nSurface water from non-calcareous soil is generally soft but usually\r\nturbid and subject to animal contamination. Such water should always\r\nbe carefully filtered.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF LAND DRAINAGE WATER FROM SEWAGE FARMS (PARTS BY WEIGHT OF\r\n100,000 PARTS).\r\n\r\n  ================+=======+=======+=======+=========+=========+=========\r\n                  |       |       |       |         |PREVIOUS |\r\n                  | TOTAL |ORGANIC|ORGANIC|CHLORINE.| SEWAGE  |HARDNESS.\r\n                  |IMPURI-|CARBON.| NITRO-|         |OR ANIMAL|\r\n                  | TIES. |       |  GEN. |         |CONTAMIN-|\r\n                  |       |       |       |         |  ATION. |\r\n  ----------------+-------+-------+-------+---------+---------+---------\r\n  Worst Condition.| 94.   | 2.160 | .274  |  13.10  |  10.090 |  35.58\r\n  Best      “     | 24.60 |  .108 | .055  |   4.05  |  17.920 |   9.20\r\n  Average   “     | 64.02 |  .982 | .191  |   6.36  |  10.443 |  33.09\r\n  ================+=======+=======+=======+=========+=========+=========\r\n\r\nMuch depends upon the knowledge of the climatic influences and\r\nrain-fall, extended, as it should be, through years of observation\r\nin determining the available quantity of water. Engineers, however,\r\nare liable to be too sanguine of the resources from water-sheds, by\r\nassuming, as a general rule, the average, rather than the minimum,\r\nrain-fall.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 nearly all the cities and towns of England, supplied by\r\ngravitation, suffered a water-famine, because of the overestimate of\r\nthe available rain-fall, and in an insufficient provision of storage\r\nfor an unusually long drought. Although the rain-fall for the year\r\nwas above the average, yet it was unequally distributed.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Manchester were obliged to publish official\r\nnotices cautioning the inhabitants against waste, and, on the 3d\r\nof August, limited the supply to the city to twelve hours of the\r\nday, stopped the street watering, and diminished the trade supplies\r\nby one-half. In the middle of September the general supply of the\r\ntown was further limited to eight hours per day. Many persons were\r\nprosecuted for waste or undue use of water.\r\n\r\nLiverpool, Sheffield, Bristol, and several other large cities were\r\nobliged to resort to like severe methods enforced at Manchester. New\r\nYork has been using every gallon that the aqueduct is capable of\r\nsupplying; and, during the drought of last summer, when the head of\r\nwater at Croton Lake was diminished, the capacity of the aqueduct\r\nwas so reduced that the flow of water to the city was reduced, and a\r\nwater-famine averted only by a Providential rain-fall.\r\n\r\nThe rule observed among engineers, in Great Britain, in determining\r\nthe calculated rain-fall, is the deduction of one-sixth from the\r\naverage rain-fall of twenty years for an average annual rain-fall\r\nof the three driest consecutive years in that period. But, as Mr.\r\nHomersham, C. E., observes, the axiom in mechanics, that the strength\r\nof a beam is the strength only of its weakest parts, applies also to\r\ngravitation water-works, their real strength or power of supply being\r\nonly the minimum quantity they may be reduced to.\r\n\r\nAllowance for absorption depends upon the geological formation and\r\nstratification, and for evaporation, upon local influences.\r\n\r\nThe following is taken from Hughes’ Water-Works:\r\n\r\n  “A flat, low-lying country is seldom well adapted for the\r\n  impounding of water by embanking across the valleys. In such a\r\n  district, long and shallow embankments would be required, and\r\n  these would cause the water to spread out over a great area with a\r\n  very shallow depth. Under these circumstances, the water is apt to\r\n  vegetate and become highly impure. Again, in low-lying districts of\r\n  flat countries the rain-fall is seldom nearly so great as in upland\r\n  districts, so that much larger drainage areas must be sought.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the general configuration of the valleys, which ought\r\nto be deep and with precipitous sides, flanked by lofty hills, there\r\nare several other points which require attentive examination in\r\nprojects for collecting water from drainage areas:\r\n\r\n  1. The area of water-shed.\r\n\r\n  2. The geological character of the soil as affecting its capacity\r\n  to absorb rain, and to allow the infiltration of water through it.\r\n\r\n  3. The character of the surface soil as affording soluble\r\n  ingredients which may be taken up by the water and serve to\r\n  contaminate its quality. In this point of view, districts of\r\n  decomposing peat, districts of arable agricultural land richly\r\n  manured, and places thickly covered with population, are often\r\n  highly objectionable.\r\n\r\n  4. The rain-fall of the district, and especially the minimum fall\r\n  in any one year.\r\n\r\n  5. The nature of the surface-soil as affording facilities for\r\n  procuring puddle and constructing retentive reservoirs.\r\n\r\n  6. The consideration of compensation to mill-owners and possibly to\r\n  land-owners where the water is used for irrigation.\r\n\r\nThe geological structure is extremely important in estimating the\r\ncapacity of a drainage area. It is not alone the rain which falls on\r\nthe sloping surface of the hills, and finds its way by gravitation\r\nto the lower levels; but the effect of springs is also very great\r\nin augmenting the quantity of water. Many drainage areas are also\r\nvalleys of elevation, in which the strata dip in opposite or\r\nanticlinal directions on opposite sides of the valley. In this case\r\nit is evident that much of the rain falling on a porous surface will\r\ninsinuate itself between the partings of the strata, and flow off in\r\na direction contrary to that of the surface drainage.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Beardmore’s work we take the following, as the proportion or\r\npercentage of rain-fall which flows off the surface:\r\n\r\n  “From twenty examples we have 89 as the largest per centage, the\r\n  lowest 29 per cent., and the average 64 per cent.\r\n\r\n  “The Eaton Brook water-shed, in Madison County, New York, of\r\n  6,800 acres, with steep slope and compact soil, underlaid by hard\r\n  greywacke rock, elevated 1,350 feet above the sea, availed 66 per\r\n  cent. of the rain-fall as surface flow.\r\n\r\n  “A similar water-shed, Madison Brook, gave 50 per cent. Experiments\r\n  by Wm. McAlpine, for Albany water-works, shows that from a\r\n  water-shed of 2,600 acres, 41½ per cent. of the rain-fall was\r\n  carried off by the streams from May till October, inclusive, while\r\n  from November till April, 77.6 per cent. was so carried off.”\r\n\r\nIn England the allowance for absorption and evaporation ranges from\r\nnine to nineteen inches per annum. In this country it is from 75 to\r\n100 per cent. greater.\r\n\r\nWe produce from “Fanning’s Water Supply” the following table of\r\nexperiments on evaporation from surfaces of shallow tanks:\r\n\r\n  Cambridge--Length of trial, one year; evaporation in inches,     56.00\r\n  Salem               “           “           “        “           56.00\r\n  Syracuse            “           “           “        “           50.20\r\n  Ogdensburgh         “           “           “        “           49.37\r\n  Dorset, England     “      three years      “        “           25.92\r\n  Oxford     “        “      five    “        “        “           31.04\r\n  Bombay              “      five    “        “        “           82.28\r\n  Croton            average, six,    “   mean evap. equal 81     } 39.21\r\n                                         per cent. of rain-fall. }\r\n  Lea Bridge, London  “      seven   “   average rain-fall         27.7\r\n                                         annual evap. min.         12.067\r\n                                           “      “   max.         25.141\r\n\r\nThe following from the same author of the minimum flow of streams in\r\ncubic feet per second, per each square mile of water-shed:\r\n\r\n  From     1 square mile  .083\r\n  From    10 square miles .1\r\n  From    25 square miles .11\r\n  From    50 square miles .14\r\n  From   100 square miles .18\r\n  From   250 square miles .25\r\n  From   500 square miles .40\r\n  From 1,000 square miles .35\r\n  From 1,500 square miles .38\r\n  From 2,000 square miles .41\r\n\r\nFrom the different surfaces, its ratio of the annual rain, including\r\nfloods and flow of springs, is approximately as follows:\r\n\r\n                                             PER CENT.\r\n  From mountain slopes or steep rocky hills, 80 to 90\r\n  From wooded swamp lands,                   60 to 80\r\n  From undulating pasture and woodland,      50 to 70\r\n  From flat cultivated land and prairie,     45 to 60\r\n\r\n\r\nMONTHLY EVAPORATION FROM RESERVOIR.\r\n\r\n(_From Fanning._)\r\n\r\n  ------------------+----+----+----+----+----+-----+\r\n                    |JAN.|FEB.|MAR.|APR.|MAY.|JUNE.|\r\n  ------------------+----+----+----+----+----+-----+\r\n  Mean ratio--inches|.30 |.35 |.50 |.80 |1.45|1.70 |\r\n  ==================+====+====+====+====+====+=====+\r\n\r\n    ------------------+-----+----+-----+----+----+----\r\n                      |JULY.|AUG.|SEPT.|OCT.|NOV.|DEC.\r\n    ------------------+-----+----+-----+----+----+----\r\n    Mean ratio--inches|1.85 |2.00|1.45 |.75 |.50 |.35\r\n    ==================+=====+====+=====+====+====+====\r\n\r\n\r\nAVERAGE AVAILABLE RAIN-FALL FOR STORAGE PURPOSES.\r\n\r\n(_From Fanning._)\r\n\r\n  ------------------------+----+----+----+------+----+-----+\r\n                          |JAN.|FEB.|MAR.|APRIL.|MAY.|JUNE.|\r\n                          +----+----+----+------+----+-----+\r\n  Gain by rain--inches    |2.00|2.21|2.40| 2.93 |3.47|2.88 |\r\n  Loss by evaporation--in.| .60| .70|1.00| 1.60 |2.90|3.40 |\r\n                          +----+----+----+------+----+-----+\r\n  Difference--Gain inches |1.40|1.51|1.40| 1.33 | .57|  -- |\r\n  Difference--Loss inches | -- | -- | -- |  --  | -- | .52 |\r\n  ========================+====+====+====+======+====+=====+\r\n\r\n    ------------------------+-----+----+-----+----+----+----+------\r\n                            |JULY.|AUG.|SEPT.|OCT.|NOV.|DEC.|TOTAL.\r\n                            +-----+----+-----+----+----+----+------\r\n    Gain by rain--inches    |2.99 |3.00|2.67 |2.53|2.48|2.24| 32.\r\n    Loss by evaporation--in.|3.70 |4.00|2.90 |1.50|1.00| .70| 24.\r\n                            +-----+----+-----+----+----+----+------\r\n    Difference--Gain inches |  -- | -- |  -- |1.03|1.48|1.54|  8.\r\n    Difference--Loss inches | .71 | .80| .23 | -- | -- | -- |  --\r\n    ========================+=====+====+=====+====+====+====+======\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF FLOW OF RAIN-FALL IN CU.

And there is no longer any excuse for incurring the outlay\r\nwhich must attend the erection of monumental structures, such as were\r\nnecessary in the times of the ancient Romans.\r\n\r\nThe engineer of Marseilles Conduit adopted the “Pont du Gard” plan\r\nfor conducting the waters of the Durance, in preference to iron\r\npipes, and constructed the splendid folly, “as Humber terms it,” of\r\nthe aqueduct “Roquefavour.” The dimensions are:\r\n\r\n  Length, 1,289 feet.\r\n  Height, 266 feet.\r\n  1st tier of 12 arches each 49½ feet span.\r\n  2d tier of 15 arches each 52½ feet span.\r\n  Upper tier of 54 arches each 16½ feet span.\r\n\r\nThe cost was $750,000, while inverted syphon pipes could have been\r\nlaid for one-third of this sum.\r\n\r\n_The aqueduct for Glasgow_ is thirteen miles in tunnels, 3¾ miles of\r\niron-piping across valleys, and nine miles of opening cutting and\r\nbridges. There are eighty distinct tunnels, and twenty-five important\r\niron and masonry aqueducts. On the line is the Drymen bridge on\r\nmasonry piers, eighteen feet apart, with two pipes surrounded by wood\r\nlagging, a forty-eight-inch syphon at Aberfoyle Road, and a lofty\r\nbridge at Ballewan, seventy feet in height.\r\n\r\n_The Aberdeen water-works_ has a thirty-six-inch syphon, 1,200 feet\r\nin length, across Cullen Burn, supported by granite piers.\r\n\r\nThe Croton aqueduct is a masonry channel lined with brick. The bottom\r\nis an inverted arch with cord 6.75 feet, and versed sine 0.75 feet;\r\nside walls are 4 feet high, and battered so that at the top they are\r\n7′ 4″ apart, and surmounted with a semi-circular arch. The interior\r\nis 8.64 feet high, and area 53.34 square feet.\r\n\r\nThe grade is 0.021 feet per 100 feet, total length 38 miles. It\r\ncrosses the Manhattan Valley 2 miles in extent, with two 36-inch,\r\none 48, and one 60-inch cast-iron pipes, and over the Harlem River\r\nby granite bridge, known as High bridge, 100 feet above high water,\r\ncomposed of seven 50-feet and eight 80-feet spans. The conduit over\r\nthe bridge consists of two 36-inch cast-iron pipes, and a wrought\r\npipe 7 feet 6½ inches in diameter, resting upon saddles, supported by\r\ncast-iron standards placed 12 feet apart between the 36-inch pipes.\r\n\r\n_The aqueduct over Cabin John Creek_, of Washington, D. C., water\r\nsupply, consists of a single arch of masonry 220 feet span, is the\r\nlargest masonry arch in the world. The rise is 57 feet 7 inches,\r\nthickness of crown 4 feet 2 inches, and at spring 6 feet 2 inches.\r\nWater is conveyed in an iron pipe 9 feet in diameter, built in solid\r\nmasonry.\r\n\r\nThe bridge over Georgetown Creek, on line of Washington Conduit,\r\nis 200 feet span with two cords of iron pipe 4 feet in diameter,\r\n1½ inches thickness, used as water conductors. The pipes were\r\nfirst lined with staves of resinous pine 3 inches thick to prevent\r\nfreezing, but have been taken out. No allowance is made for expansion\r\nor contraction. A similar plan is in use at Philadelphia, over the\r\nvalley of Wissahikon, consisting of two 20 inch cast-iron flange\r\npipes serving as top members of a series of inverted bow-string\r\ntrusses. There are four spans, each 169 feet 9 inches. Center span\r\n100 feet above ordinary level of the water.\r\n\r\nThe Boston aqueduct crosses the Charles River by syphon pipes--two,\r\n30 inches, and the other 36 inches in diameter. Starting from a pipe\r\nchamber on the western side of the valley, the pipe descends 52.11\r\nfeet below the level of conduit, and rests on a masonry bridge of\r\nthree arches.\r\n\r\nOne of the syphons for supplying Madrid, Spain, crosses a valley\r\n4,560 feet in length, consisting of four lines of cast-iron pipes\r\nthree feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nDublin is supplied through 30,336 yards of 33-inch and 8,272 yards\r\nof two lines of 27-inch cast-iron pipes--20,000 yards laid through\r\nprivate property. The average fall is 20 feet per mile. There are\r\nthree relief-tanks on line of 33-inch pipe. The capacity of this pipe\r\nwas calculated at sixteen millions per day, while the actual delivery\r\nexceeded twenty millions.\r\n\r\nToronto is supplied by a 4-foot wooden pipe, 7,000 feet in length,\r\nunder pressure.\r\n\r\nManchester, N. H., has a wooden penstock, six feet in diameter, 600\r\nfeet in length, that conveys supply to water wheels, under a head of\r\ntwelve feet at entrance and thirty-eight feet at outlet.\r\n\r\nThe new conduit for water supply of Baltimore is a continuous\r\ntunnel, seven miles long, running from the dam to the receiving\r\nreservoir--“Lake Montebello.” In its construction no open cuts were\r\nmade; all work being done by drifting. Its depth below the surface\r\nof ground varies from 65 to 360 feet. The internal diameter is 12\r\nfeet; the fall is one foot per mile; capacity 170 millions daily.\r\nFifteen shafts were sunk during the constructive work. Two miles of\r\nthe tunnel were through material that required to be arched with\r\nbrick; the remaining distance was through very hard rock that did not\r\nrequire arching. The cost of this structure was about two millions of\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nChicago has two tunnels under Lake Michigan, parallel with each\r\nother, 46 feet apart, extending to a crib, located in the lake, two\r\nmiles from the shore. The first one was started, in 1864, under\r\nadverse criticism, and successfully completed in 1867. The cost, with\r\nthe crib, was $457,800. It is five feet horizontal diameter, and 5′\r\n2″ vertical diameter, and made of brick. The second one was built in\r\n1872-’74; is five feet in diameter, lined with brick. It extends from\r\nthe North Side Works, a further distance of 20,000 feet, under the\r\ncity and Chicago River to West Side Works. The cost of this tunnel,\r\nunder the river, was $414,000, and under the city $543,000. The\r\nnature of the excavation was generally through stiff blue clay with\r\noccasionally pockets of quicksand.\r\n\r\nThe Sudbury conduit, of Boston Water-Works, is sixteen miles long,\r\nwith a grade of 1.056 feet per mile. The top is a semicircle of nine\r\nfeet diameter, and the bottom is an arc of 13.22 feet radius, struck\r\nfrom a center 5.53 feet above the crown of the arch.

There the material used is\r\nwell puddled; then a drove of cattle is turned loose on the fill, to\r\nstamp the earth thoroughly. This method is repeated in layers until\r\nthe required height is reached. Often the Sepoys do the stamping.\r\n\r\nThe Veranun reservoir dam is twelve miles in length; and the amount\r\nof earth, of which it is composed, will encircle the globe with a\r\nbelt six feet in thickness.\r\n\r\nThere is a dam on the island of Ceylon made of huge stone blocks\r\nstrongly cemented together and covered over with turf, making a solid\r\nbarrier of fifteen miles in length, one hundred feet wide at the\r\nbase, sloping at top to forty feet, and extending across the lower\r\nend of a spacious valley.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS OR RESERVOIR DAMS.--(_From C.

In the Holly Plan, a reserve power is used for fire purposes,\r\nbesides mechanical device for regulating and controlling the variable\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIn either the stand pipe or direct system, a reserve power should be\r\nprovided equal to the largest daily consumption.\r\n\r\nFrom a compilation of general information concerning water-works of\r\nthe United States and Canada, published by the Holly Manufacturing\r\nCompany in 1878, we arrange the following:\r\n\r\n  188 cities and towns         use steam-power         for water supply.\r\n  104         “              have gravity works                “\r\n   32         “                 use water-power                “\r\n   10         “         have gravity and steam works           “\r\n   27         “           use steam and water-works            “\r\n    2         “     have gravity, steam, and water-powers      “\r\n\r\nOf the above number of pumping works--\r\n\r\n  139 have reservoir system.\r\n   98 have direct system.\r\n   16 have stand-pipe system.\r\n    4 have direct and reservoir combined.\r\n    1 has the three systems combined.\r\n    1 has stand-pipe and direct combined.\r\n\r\nThe expense of pumping water by steam and water-powers, also the\r\npractical yearly duties of various pumping engines, are given in the\r\ntables on pages 61 and 64, compiled from annual reports for 1880:\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL DUTIES (WITHOUT DEDUCTIONS) OF PUMPING ENGINES (YEARLY\r\nAVERAGE).\r\n\r\n(_From Annual Reports of 1880._)\r\n\r\n  ---------------------+-----------------+----------------------------+\r\n                       |  NON ROTATIVE.  |         ROTATIVE.          |\r\n                       +--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+\r\n                       | WORTH- |CORNISH.| HOLLY. |  LOW    |  HIGH   |\r\n                       | INGTON.|        |        |PRESSURE.|PRESSURE.|\r\n  ---------------------+--------+--------+--------+---------+---------+\r\n  Louisville, Ky.    { |   --   |44189515|   --   |   --    |   --    |\r\n                     { |   --   |45544384|   --   |   --    |   --    |\r\n                       |        |        |        |         |         |\r\n                     { |   --   |   --   |   --   |59550000 |   --    |\r\n  Brooklyn, N.

Auburn High Service at Cincinnati is supplied by two\r\nwrought-iron tanks (which answer the same purpose of stand pipes),\r\neach 60 feet in diameter and 38 feet high, and made of wrought-iron\r\nsheets 50″ by 140″, ¼″ to 7-16″ in thickness. The water surface is\r\n483 feet above low water. The cost of each tank was $15,000.\r\n\r\nThe water-tower at Toledo consists of a wrought-iron stand pipe,\r\naround which is built a masonry structure of solid stonework 36\r\nfeet square, commencing 16 feet below the natural surface, with a\r\nvertical thickness, under base of stand-pipe, of 7 feet; thence, with\r\noctagonal opening around the pipe, to a point near 3 feet above the\r\nsurface of the ground, at which point its inner diameter is 16 feet,\r\nand outer dimensions 30 feet square. From this point, to a further\r\nheight of four feet, the wall is composed of ashlar-face and brick\r\nbacking; thence to a point 70 feet above the foundation of solid\r\nbrick-work with octagon interior and exterior squares, the corners\r\nterminating in buttress walls; the top to be octagonal battering to\r\nan external diameter at the top of 14 feet. The total height is 224\r\nfeet, and the cost about $25,000.\r\n\r\nA steel plate stand-pipe designed by J. D. Cook, civil engineer\r\nfor Springfield, Ohio, is in course of erection by the Stacey\r\nManufacturing Company of Cincinnati, which will be 112 feet high, 30\r\nfeet in diameter, thickness of lower ring being 25-32″, and upper\r\nring 3-16″. The estimated cost is $35,000.\r\n\r\nThe stand-pipe of Southwark and Vauxhall Water-Works, London, is 178\r\nfeet high, made of three columns of cast-iron pipe, the center one\r\nextending 50 feet higher than the other columns. The side pipes are\r\n30 inch, and center 48 inch in diameter. The Grand Junction works,\r\nLondon, has a similar structure of two columns 153 feet high, incased\r\nin a brick structure.\r\n\r\nThe stand-pipe of East London Co. is 240 feet high and 3 feet in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUSBAND’S PATENT BALANCE VALVE.\r\n\r\nThis patent is designed to supersede the costly stand-pipe. Fixed\r\nvertically, as near to the engine as practicable, is a strong casting\r\nprovided with two short-flanged branches, the lower one being\r\nconnected with the discharge outlet from the pumps, and the upper\r\none with the delivery main. Between these branches a gun-metal valve\r\nof the double-seat description is placed, and is connected to an\r\nadditional water-tight hat working on the top of the valve-seating.\r\nThe seating is firmly held down by bolts passing through it and\r\nfastened to the casing. A ram lined with gun-metal, and of the\r\nsame diameter as the upper valve, is secured water-tight into it\r\nby a colter, and works vertically up and down, passing through a\r\nstuffing-box packed with cup leather, bolted to the upper portion of\r\nthe casing. The head of the ram works in a cross-guide lashed with\r\ngun-metal, and supported by four strong vertical pillars. The ram is\r\nloaded with weights nearly equal to the minimum load of the engine;\r\nthe lowest weight is provided with lugs working loosely over the\r\nvertical pillars, which are provided with adjusting nuts and leather\r\nwashers, for the purpose of preventing the valve from falling heavily\r\nand injuring its seating. The action of the apparatus is as follows:\r\nThe water, on entering the casing from the pumps, acts upon the under\r\nside of the upper valve. The area of the valve is the same as that of\r\nthe ram, which, being loaded somewhat under the working load of the\r\nengine, is immediately lifted, raising the valve with it, and thus\r\ngiving the water free access to the delivery main.\r\n\r\nIn the event of the main being fractured at any point beyond the\r\nvalve, the pressure within the main is suddenly reduced on account of\r\nthe great escape of water, and is, consequently, unable to support\r\nthe loaded valve, which immediately closes; thus the working load\r\nof the engine is retained, and the possibility of accident by racing\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUEL EXPENSE FOR PUMPING COMPARED ON DUTY BASES.--(_Fanning._)\r\n\r\n  ========+==============================================================\r\n  DUTY IN | NUMBER MILLION GALLONS PUMPED DAILY, ONE HUNDRED FEET HIGH.\r\n  MILLION |                COAL IN FURNACE AT $8 PER TON.\r\n    FOOT  +---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------\r\n   POUNDS.|    1    |   2    |   3    |   4    |   6    |   8    |  10\r\n  --------+---------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+-------\r\n    100   |$1,277.86| $2,556 | $3,834 | $5,111 | $7,667 |$10,223 |$12,779\r\n     90   | 1,419.85|  2,840 |  4,260 |  5,679 |  8,519 | 11,359 | 14,198\r\n     80   | 1,597.32|  3,195 |  4,792 |  6,389 |  9,584 | 12,778 | 15,973\r\n     70   | 1,825.51|  3,651 |  5,477 |  7,302 | 10,953 | 14,604 | 18,255\r\n     60   | 2,129.76|  4,260 |  6,389 |  8,519 | 12,779 | 17,038 | 21,298\r\n     50   | 2,555.72|  5,111 |  7,667 | 10,223 | 15,334 | 20,446 | 25,557\r\n     40   | 3,194.65|  6,384 |  9,584 | 12,769 | 19,168 | 25,537 | 31,946\r\n     30   | 4,259.53|  8,519 | 12,779 | 17,038 | 25,557 | 34,076 | 42,595\r\n     20   | 6,389.30| 12,768 | 19,168 | 25,537 | 39,336 | 51,174 | 63,893\r\n  ========+==============================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMENSIONS AND COST OF CONSTRUCTING PUMPING ENGINES.\r\n\r\n  ==========+======+=================================+=========+===========+\r\n            | WHEN |                                 |MAX.

The storage capacity nine billion gallons. The capacity\r\nof the aqueduct is ninety-two millions of gallons per day.\r\n\r\nThere are three distributing reservoirs:\r\n\r\n  One of  150   million.\r\n  One of 1200      “     in Central Park.\r\n  One of   24      “\r\n  One of   10¾     “     for high service.\r\n\r\nThe population is 1,206,500; miles of water-pipe, 500--the largest\r\nbeing seventy-two inches in diameter; the average daily consumption\r\nof water ninety-five millions; number of taps, 77,000. All buildings\r\nare assessed by frontage-tax besides usual water rates. The meter\r\nrate is 7½ cents per thousand gallons.\r\n\r\nThe original cost of the gravitation works was about nine millions;\r\npresent water-works valuation is thirty-two millions.\r\n\r\nAn additional supply from Bronx River is now in course of\r\nconstruction. The water will be conducted through an aqueduct, of\r\nforty-eight inch cast-iron pipe, twenty miles in length. During last\r\nsummer a water-famine was prevented by a Providential rain-fall.\r\n\r\n_Philadelphia_ was supplied with water, systematically, in 1801;\r\npreviously, wells were the only source.\r\n\r\nThe system of supply is pumping by steam and water-power,\r\nthirty-seven per cent. being done by the water-wheels in 1880.\r\n\r\nThe available capacity of water-wheels is 36,000,000 gallons daily.\r\nDuring summer there is a deficiency of power. Capacity of all the\r\npumps 71.8 million gallons. There are 16 reservoirs, with a total\r\ncapacity of 200 millions. The distribution of water is divided\r\namong the various works in relation to respective elevation. The\r\npopulation, in 1880, was 846,984. Miles of pipe, 746. Daily average\r\nconsumption, in 1880, 57.7 millions. Largest daily consumption 80½\r\nmillions. Number of meters 30. Total receipts, in 1880, were nearly\r\n1½ millions of dollars; and expenditures nearly $400,000. Laying of\r\nwater-pipes assessed on abutting property. Total profits, since 1855,\r\nover twelve millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe pumping stations and performance for 1880 are:\r\n\r\n  ========================+=================+========+=================+\r\n         STATIONS.        |PER CENT OF WATER|  LIFT  |  SOURCE OF      |\r\n                          | PUMPED IN 1880. |IN FEET.|    SUPPLY.      |\r\n  ------------------------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+\r\n  Fairmount, water-power. |     37.35       |    90  |Schuylkill River |\r\n  Schuylkill, steam-power.|     25.96       |   120  |    “        “   |\r\n  Belmont,       “    “   |     16.78       |   207  |    “        “   |\r\n  Delaware,      “    “   |      9.45       |   133  |Delaware     “   |\r\n  Roxborough,    “    “   |      5.52       |   346  |Schuylkill   “   |\r\n  Chestnut Hill, “    “   |       .02       |   125  |    “        “   |\r\n  Frankford,     “    “   |       4.50      |   203  |Delaware     “   |\r\n  ========================+=================+========+=================+\r\n\r\n    ========================+=======================================\r\n           STATIONS.        |           POWER.\r\n                            |\r\n    ------------------------+---------------------------------------\r\n    Fairmount, water-power. | 7 Turbine water-wheels.\r\n    Schuylkill, steam-power.| 2 Cornish and 2 Compound Engines.\r\n    Belmont,       “    “   | 5 Worthingtons.\r\n    Delaware,      “    “   | 1 Worthington, 1 low, 1 high pressure.\r\n    Roxborough,    “    “   | 1 Cornish, 1 Worth., and 1 Knowles.\r\n    Chestnut Hill, “    “   | 1 horizontal high pressure.\r\n    Frankford,     “    “   | 1 compound and 1 Worthington.\r\n    ========================+=======================================\r\n\r\n_Brooklyn._--Water-works introduced in 1859. The system is by\r\npumping, with reservoir distribution. The source is the southern\r\nslope of Long Island Sound, ten to twenty-two miles from East River.\r\nThe water is gathered from a drainage area of 60½ square miles by\r\nintercepting ponds, and conducted, through masonry conduit, to the\r\npump well, seven miles from East River. The natural flow, from these\r\nponds, into the conduit being insufficient during summer time,\r\npumping engines were erected, 1874, at Watts’ and Smith’s ponds to\r\nmeet the deficiency.\r\n\r\nThe storage reservoir, built in 1873-’76, has a water surface of\r\n250 acres, and a capacity of one billion gallons. There are three\r\nlow-pressure beam-engines, with a combined capacity of 44 millions\r\ndaily. The distributing reservoir is 3,400 feet from pumping wells,\r\nat 163 feet elevation and with a capacity of 160 millions.\r\n\r\nPopulation, in 1880, was 566,689. Miles of pipe, 351. Daily average\r\nconsumption of water, in 1880, 30¾ millions. Largest daily\r\nconsumption 48 millions; number of taps, 60,000; meters, 859;\r\noriginal cost of works, $5,200,000.\r\n\r\n_Chicago._--The first works were constructed by the Chicago City\r\nHydraulic Company in 1840, Lake Michigan being the source. The\r\nsuperiority of this water, as compared with well water, so manifested\r\nitself during the cholera of 1849-’50 that the works became a public\r\ninstitution, under whose control they were enlarged, in 1854, after\r\nplans of Wm. J. McAlpine, C. E. The system is constant pumping\r\nthrough stand-pipe distribution, 120 feet above city datum. There are\r\ntwo pumping stations--North Side and West Side--the latter being the\r\nnew works, erected in 1874. The source is Lake Michigan. Previous to\r\n1867 the intakes were near the shore; and, in order to secure pure\r\nwater, a brick tunnel, five feet wide by five feet two inches in\r\ndepth, was built under the lake, a length of two miles, to a crib\r\nlocated in the lake. A second tunnel, 5 ft. in diameter, parallel to\r\nthe first, and forty-six feet apart, was constructed to the North\r\nSide Works, thence continuing under the city, a distance of 20,000\r\nfeet, to the West Side Works. The North Side Works has four engines,\r\nwith a combined capacity of 64 millions; and the West Side Works two\r\nengines, with a capacity of 46 millions.\r\n\r\nIn 1856 a twenty-four inch wrought main was laid in the Chicago\r\nRiver; but, before brought into use, was injured by pile-driving, and\r\nhad to be relaid. In 1869 all the submerged mains were abandoned,\r\nbecause of frequent accidents, and brick tunnels, six feet in\r\ndiameter, were built under the river. The statistics for 1880 were:\r\nPopulation, 503,304; miles of pipe, 450; daily average consumption,\r\n57.4 million gallons; number of meters, 2,000. Cost of West Side\r\nWorks, with new tunnel, $1,600,000. Total cost of works, $8,644,000.\r\n\r\n_Boston._--In 1835 there were 2,767 wells in use, thirty-three of\r\nwhich were artesian, besides a water-works under the control of “The\r\nAqueduct Corporation.” Out of the whole number of wells only seven\r\nfurnished water soft enough to use for washing. In 1840 there was\r\ngreat complaint of the deficiency of wells, and in one case it was\r\nstated that a well from which many drew their water, was kept locked\r\nexcept at certain hours. During this time there were 56 reservoirs,\r\neach holding 300 to 400 hogsheads. In 1848 water was first introduced\r\nfrom Lake Cochituate, through a brick conduit (except the cast-iron\r\nsyphon over Charles River), oviform in shape, large end down, 6.33\r\nfeet high and 5 feet wide. Its length is 14.627 miles, with a total\r\nfall of 4.26 feet. It has a capacity of delivering 16 million gallons\r\ndaily, with a velocity of one foot per second. The area of water\r\nsurface, at full water, of Lake Cochituate is 800 acres; when drawn\r\ndown 10 feet or level of the flow line of conduit, the area is 489\r\nacres. Elevation is 134.36 feet, and bottom of conduit at dam 121\r\nfeet above tide level. There are two granite dams 500 feet apart.\r\nThe first dam was built on quicksand, and after filling of the lake,\r\nsprings boiled up and washed away the sand.\r\n\r\nThe new supply from Sudbury River was inaugurated in 1878. The\r\ndrainage is 78.24 square miles. The conduit is 16 miles long, with\r\na grade of 1.056 feet per mile. It is built of concrete and rubble\r\nmasonry, lined with brick. It crosses the Charles River by granite\r\nbridge 475 feet long and 75 feet high. Its sectional area is 56.75\r\nsquare feet, and capacity 70 millions daily.\r\n\r\nThere are two earth embankment reservoirs, one of 120 millions and\r\nthe other of 550 millions capacity, besides four stone masonry\r\nstructures of 22 millions capacity combined. One of the latter is\r\nused for high service, is 219 feet above tide, and has a capacity\r\nof 7 millions. The Roxbury High Service is supplied by two 20″ by\r\n36″ pumps, through a stand-pipe 5 feet in diameter and 80 feet high.\r\nThere is also a couple of temporary high service works. There are\r\nseveral cast-iron syphons of 20 and 24-inch pipes, with ball and\r\nsocket points, submerged in the rivers. A crack in one of these\r\n20-inch pipes was stopped by pine wedges, and then covered with\r\nan india-rubber band, secured by iron clamps. The work was done\r\nby a diver, and occupied three weeks. The Mystic Water-Works, of\r\nCharleston, became a part of the Boston Water System in 1873, by\r\nannexation.\r\n\r\nThe population is 412,000; miles of pipe, 500; daily average\r\nconsumption, 36 millions; number of water takers is 68,334. There are\r\n1,313 meters in use. The value of the works to December, 1880, was\r\n$18,354,716.17.\r\n\r\n_St. Louis._--The first water-works was built at foot of Bates\r\nStreet in 1830, eight years after it became an incorporated city.\r\nThe old works were entirely abandoned in 1872, when the new works,\r\nbuilt after the design of Jas. P. Kirkwood, civil engineer, were\r\nput in operation. The new pumping stations is at Bissell’s Point at\r\nthe northern city limit. The water is taken from Mississippi River,\r\nthrough a cast-iron tower (arranged to take water at any level) sunk\r\nin the river to the bed rock, and conducted by a 66-inch iron pipe to\r\nthe first or low service pumps, which raises the water from 15 to 50\r\nfeet, according to the stage of the river, into settling basins (four\r\nin number, each 25 millions capacity); from thence it flows through a\r\nbrick conduit 1,100 feet long, to the clear well of the high service\r\nor main works. The clear water is pumped through a stand pipe into a\r\nreservoir on Compton Hill, 870 feet by 540 feet, and 22 feet deep,\r\nand 176 feet above city directrix. The low service works has two\r\nCornish bull and one rotative engine, and the main works has three\r\ncombination beam engines with a combined capacity of 40 millions of\r\ngallons daily. The sediment in the water amounts, at times, to 1.8\r\nper cent. of the total bulk. Nine hundred and forty-four parts in\r\none thousand of the sediment is deposited within twenty-four hours\r\nin still water. One of the old reservoirs was abandoned entirely for\r\ntwelve years, on account of the accumulation of deposit, being 30\r\nfeet in depth. It was cleaned by hydraulic mining, after a method\r\ndesigned by Henry Flad, civil engineer.\r\n\r\nThe population by last census is 350,522; miles of pipe, 200; daily\r\nconsumption, 25 millions; number of taps, 20,000.\r\n\r\nThe cost of the new works was about five millions of dollars.\r\n\r\n_Baltimore._--In 1814 an association was formed for the purpose\r\nof introducing a copious supply of wholesome water into the city\r\nfrom Jones’ Falls. The works were purchased by the city in 1854 for\r\n$1,350,000, and enlarged in 1857-’62. The river water is diverted\r\ninto Lake Roland, an artificial lake of 116 acres water surface.\r\nFrom this reservoir it is brought through an elliptical conduit,\r\n3.62 miles, and discharged into Hampden Reservoir. This reservoir\r\nis semicircle in form, 1,000 feet diameter, with a water surface of\r\n8 acres. It is 217 feet above tide. From this point the water flows\r\nthrough three lines of 30-inch cast-iron pipe, 7,100 feet in length,\r\ninto Mt. Royal Reservoir, which is a circular structure 550 feet in\r\ndiameter with a water surface of 5 acres, and 150 feet above tide.\r\nThis reservoir supplies that portion of the city below 112 feet\r\nelevation. The Hampden Reservoir supplies the districts between 112\r\nfeet and 188 feet above tide, and the high service reservoir the\r\ndistrict between 188 feet and 320 feet above tide. In 1867 the Druid\r\nLake was constructed with a view of storing clear water, to be used\r\nwhen Lake Roland was muddy. It is made by building an earthen dam\r\n(across a natural valley in Druid Hill Park), 119 feet high in the\r\nmiddle with a puddled wall in the center 36 feet wide at the bottom.\r\nThe greatest depth of water is 63 feet. Seven lines of cast-iron\r\npipe were originally laid under the embankment, but broke within two\r\nyears. Five lines of 30-inch pipe were then laid through a cut-in\r\nrock. Its capacity is 493,000,000 gallons, with water surface of 53\r\nacres. The high service reservoir is circular, 500 feet diameter, 20\r\nfeet deep, and 350 feet above tide, and supplied by two Worthington\r\npumps.\r\n\r\nThe new supply from Gunpowder River is brought through a 12-foot\r\nconduit 7 miles in length, having a capacity of 170 million gallons,\r\nto Montebello Reservoir, of 80 acres water surface, and 163 feet\r\nabove tide. From here it is conveyed partly in tunnel and in open cut\r\n5,391 feet to Lake Clifton, which has a water surface of 30¼ acres\r\nand elevation 163 feet above tide, and 31 feet deep. Provisions are\r\nmade for six 40-inch mains; two now being used. The new system cost\r\n$4,704,260.83, and was formerly inaugurated in October, 1881. The\r\nstatistics for 1880 are: population, 332,190; miles of pipe, 277;\r\nwater takers, 49,000; meters, 524; outstanding bonds amounting to 9\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\n_Buffalo_ takes its supply from a pier in Niagara River, and is\r\nconducted through a tunnel 22½ feet below the river bottom. The\r\nsystem is pumping and reservoir distribution with Holly plan for fire\r\npurposes and supply of higher levels. At the pumping station there\r\nare two Worthingtons--one of 10 million and the other of 15 million\r\ncapacity--and a condensing beam engine of 8 million capacity. A third\r\nWorthington is now in course of erection. There are three Holly\r\npumps, one of 1½ millions; one of 2½ millions; and one of 6 millions\r\ncapacity, which take their supply from the face main 20 feet below\r\nthe reservoir, and pump directly into the mains. The statistics for\r\n1880 are: population, 155,137; miles of pipe, 102; daily consumption,\r\n16½ million gallons; water-takers, 9,099. The original cost of the\r\nworks was $400,000. Present value 3 million dollars, outstanding\r\nbonds $2,950,000.\r\n\r\n_Washington_ is supplied from the Potomac River by diverting the\r\nwaters at Great Falls 17 miles above the city, by a dam of cut\r\nmasonry with rip-rap backing. Its top is 148 feet above tide level at\r\nWashington. The water is conducted through a brick aqueduct 9 feet in\r\ndiameter, with a grade of 0.75 feet per mile. The reservoir at Powder\r\nMill Branch (made by damming the stream), has a water surface of 50\r\nacres, with a capacity of 176 million gallons. The expectation that\r\nthe Potomac water, which is frequently very muddy, would have time to\r\nsettle in this reservoir before being drawn from its outlet was not\r\nrealized in consequence of the turbidity of drainage water collected\r\nby the reservoir itself; a connecting conduit was therefore built in\r\n1864 to supply direct from Potomac River, during freshets, in Powder\r\nMill Branch.\r\n\r\nThe high levels of Georgetown or those more than 90 feet above tide\r\nlevel, are supplied by pumping and reservoir distribution. The\r\nreservoir is a hemispherical brick structure, 120 feet in diameter,\r\nand 220 feet above tide.\r\n\r\nThe statistics for 1880 are: population, 147,307; miles of pipe,\r\n175; daily consumption of water, 26 million gallons; number of taps,\r\n17,000. Cost of aqueduct and its maintenance to June 30, 1880, was\r\n3.8 million dollars, and for water mains, 1.7 millions.\r\n\r\n_Louisville._--The Louisville Water Company was chartered in 1854,\r\nand in 1856 the city subscribed to the capital stock to the amount\r\nof $550,000. The supply is taken from the Ohio River, 1½ miles above\r\nthe city limits. The intake is 300 feet from shore, 50 feet in\r\ndiameter, made of a crib of timber filled in with stone, the mouth\r\nof the inlet being 5 by 12 feet, and set 1 foot below lowest stage\r\nof water. By 1865 the inlet pipe was half full of silt; in order to\r\nclean it a well was sunk over the pipe, 105 feet from its end, the\r\npipe cut, and then cleaned out. In 1877 the pipe was again cleansed.\r\nAnchor ice has given them much trouble. There are two Cornish beam\r\nengines which deliver the water through a wrought-iron stand pipe,\r\n48 inches in diameter and 132 feet high, into a reservoir of earth\r\nembankments, 141 feet above low water, and 3,650 feet from the works.\r\nThe water surface of this reservoir is 178 by 374 feet. The new\r\nreservoir on Crescent Hill is 175 feet above low water, and 2½ miles\r\nfrom stand-pipe. It has a capacity of 100 millions. Notwithstanding\r\nextraordinary care having been taken in the foundations of this\r\nreservoir, leaks and slips occurred soon after it was filled.\r\n\r\nThe statistics for 1880 are: Population, 123,645; miles of pipe, 110;\r\ndaily consumption of water, 5½ million gallons; number of meters,\r\n201; hydraulic elevators. 50; value of the works--construction,\r\n$800,000; enlargements, $2,400,000; total, 3.2 million dollars.\r\n\r\n_San Francisco_ is supplied by the Spring Valley Water Company from\r\nthree sources. One from Lobos Creek, 4 miles from the city, where the\r\nwater is gathered after slow percolation through sand, and conducted\r\nthrough 23,700 feet of wood and masonry aqueduct to the pumping-works\r\n(at zero datum of city level) at Point Black. These engines raise\r\nthe water into two reservoirs on Russian Hill, respectively 396 feet\r\nand 139 feet above city datum. The ordinary yield of the source is\r\n2¼ millions daily. Another source is from the mountains of San Mateo\r\nCounty, 15 miles from San Francisco, where a dam was built in 1864,\r\n640 feet long, 26 feet wide on top, 95 feet high, with slopes 2¾\r\nand 2½ to 1 foot. A puddle-trench is sunk 26 feet below the natural\r\nsurface to the rock. After the reservoir was full, a leak appeared\r\nat one end of the dam caused by an unsound rock. While the reservoir\r\nwas full a shaft was sunk 80 feet deep to the point, and the rock\r\nremoved and replaced with puddle. This reservoir is 46 feet deep, and\r\nhas a capacity of 1,083 million gallons, with a water surface of 692\r\nfeet above the sea. The water is conducted 13 miles, through a flume\r\npartly of 30-inch wrought-iron pipe, to Lagunda Honda Reservoir, 377\r\nfeet above the sea, with a capacity of 33 million gallons.\r\n\r\nThe third supply is brought from the water-shed of Lock’s Creek, 2.75\r\nsquare miles in area, and 505 feet above tide. This water is conveyed\r\n17.42 miles to St. Andres Reservoir through wrought-iron pipes and\r\ntunnels lined with solid masonry.\r\n\r\nThe St. Andres Reservoir has a capacity of 7,000 million gallons, and\r\nis formed by an earth dam 640 feet long, 25 feet wide on the top, and\r\n93 feet high, with a puddle-trench 47 feet more to the rock. The cost\r\nof the works to 1875 was $8,746,928.12. Amount paid on dividends to\r\nstockholders $4,701,562.18.\r\n\r\nThe population in 1880 was 233,956, and daily consumption of water 17\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\n_Cleveland._--The water-works were constructed in 1853 after the\r\nplans of T. R. Scowden, civil engineer. The system is pumping through\r\nstand pipe with reservoir distribution. The source is Lake Erie,\r\nwhere the water is taken through a crib located in lake, 1¼ miles\r\nfrom shore, and conducted through tunnel under lake to the pump\r\nwells. The pumping stations contains two Cornish, a “Henderson”\r\ncompound duplex, and a 10 million Worthington. The combined capacity\r\nis 28 million gallons. Another Worthington engine is being added\r\nto the service. The stand pipe is 148 feet high and 36 inches in\r\ndiameter. The reservoir is made of earth embankments, 21 feet deep,\r\nwith a capacity of 8 million gallons.\r\n\r\nThe population for 1880 was 160,142; miles of pipe, 125½; daily\r\nconsumption of water, 10.18 million gallons.\r\n\r\nTotal cost of works to January 1, 1878, was $2,402,000. Bonded\r\nindebtedness, $1,725,000. Cost of original works, $523,000.\r\n\r\n_Portland, Maine_, is supplied with water from Lake Sebago, which has\r\nstorage capacity sufficient to supply the largest city of the world.\r\nThe total area of water-shed is 520 square miles. The annual receipt\r\nof moisture, including rain and snow, is 51 billion cubic feet,\r\nwhile the discharge is 20½ billion cubic feet. The water is conveyed\r\npartly through a box conduit, 3′ 9″ by 3′ 6½″, an oval brick conduit\r\n5,440 feet long, 2½′ by 3½′, to a gate-house, whence two wrought-iron\r\nmains, lined inside and covered outside with best quality Rosendale\r\ncement, each 16 miles long, distribute the water to the city. One of\r\nthe mains is 20 inches in diameter for the whole length, the other 26\r\nand 24 inches, and respectively 4 and 12 miles long. The water system\r\nis owned by the Portland Water Company.\r\n\r\n_Cincinnati._--The permanent system of water supply was commenced\r\nin 1817, when city council granted to the Cincinnati Manufacturing\r\nCompany the privilege of supplying the city with water for\r\nninety-nine years at an annual consideration of $100--the water to\r\nflow three feet above the first floor of James Ferguson’s kitchen, on\r\nwest side of Vine, between Sixth and Seventh Streets, by 1820.\r\n\r\nThe first water was drawn from a wooden penstock at Sycamore Street\r\nand Lower Market, July, 1821, being raised by horse-power from Ohio\r\nRiver at the present site of pumping works, and forced into a wooden\r\nreservoir, and from thence delivered through wooden pipes to water\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati Manufacturing Company transferred its privileges, in\r\n1820, to Samuel W. Davis, and by him sold to Cincinnati Water Company\r\nin 1825. The entire works were purchased by the city in 1839, for the\r\nsum of $300,000, and consisted of 19 miles of wooden pipes, 3½ miles\r\nof iron pipe, reservoir in three compartments of 1,700,000 gallons\r\ncapacity, two high pressure pumping engines with a capacity of\r\n4,200,000 gallons per twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe management of the water department was vested first with a board\r\nof directors composed of one councilman from each ward. In 1847 this\r\npower was given, by act of legislature, to a board of three trustees\r\nelected by the people, and in 1876 the Board of Public Works was\r\nestablished, which assumed entire control of all the public works,\r\nincluding the water-works.\r\n\r\nThe city is supplied by pumping and reservoir system, with a main\r\nand two auxiliary pumping works, and four distinct reservoir or\r\ndistributing services.\r\n\r\nThe main work is located on the bank of the Ohio River, and takes\r\nits supply through two stone aqueducts, each 100 feet in length. The\r\nwestern one is extended 60 feet further into the channel of the river\r\nby two 40-inch wrought-iron pipes.\r\n\r\nThe pumping engines at these works are--three double and three single\r\nengines with a combined theoretical capacity of 49 millions, with\r\npresent available capacity of 32 millions. The oldest reservoir,\r\nbuilt in 1850-’53, is a stone structure, entirely above the surface\r\nground, made in two divisions 23 feet in depth; the eastern part\r\nbeing 163 by 116 feet, and western 180 by 116 feet. Its capacity is\r\n5½ million gallons. The cost was $50,000; its elevation, 176 feet\r\nabove low-water mark in the Ohio River. The largest reservoir is\r\nbuilt in a ravine, where a masonry structure was erected 1,251 feet\r\nlong, 120 feet high, 48½ feet in width at the bottom, and 25 feet on\r\ntop. There are two compartments formed by a masonry wall 307 feet in\r\nlength, 30 feet at the base, 10 feet on top, and 67½ feet extreme\r\nheight. The upper part contains 57 millions, and the lower 43 million\r\ngallons, at 30 feet depth. The elevation of flow line is 235 feet\r\nabove low water in the Ohio River. The cost was $1,660,000. The high\r\nservice No. 1 supplies nearly two millions daily to the hill-tops,\r\npumping into two iron tanks, each 60 feet diameter by 38 feet high,\r\n310 feet above the pumping station level, through 2,700 feet of\r\n20-inch and 4,501 feet of 16-inch cast-iron pipe. The cost of this\r\nservice to 1881, with forty miles of pipe, two pumping engines of\r\nsix million capacity, tanks, etc., was nearly half a million dollars.\r\n\r\nNo. 2, high service, was started in June, 1881. About 15,000 gallons\r\nare pumped daily into an iron tank, thirty feet in diameter by\r\nsixteen feet high, temporarily erected on wooden supports sixteen\r\nfeet high. The elevation of flow line of tank is 354 feet above the\r\npump station.\r\n\r\n  Number of miles of pipe in use (1880)                  189\r\n  Number of valves in use                              2,334\r\n  Number of branches or taps                          23,627\r\n  Number of meters                                       545\r\n  Number of hydraulic elevators                          318\r\n  Daily average consumption of water for 1880     19,476,739\r\n  Population                                         260,000\r\n  Gallons of water per inhabitant per 24 hours            75\r\n  Largest consumption of water for one day, 1880  27,951,391\r\n\r\nThe present value of works is $6,778,847.55, distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Hunt Street Pumping Works                 $  184,475.98\r\n  Front  “       “      “                    1,696,356.33\r\n  Third Street Reservoir and property          400,000.00\r\n  Mt.

Cook, C. E. The water is taken from the Maumee River, through\r\na hexagonal crib, made of two rows of piling, with the space\r\nfilled with broken stone and coarse gravel, and conveyed, through\r\nwrought-iron pipe and five foot brick conduit five hundred feet long,\r\nto filter gallery of 19,000 square feet. The filtering material is\r\n24 inches of broken stone, 6 inches of 2-inch gravel, 6 inches of\r\n1-inch gravel, 6 inches of ½-inch gravel, 6 inches of ¼-inch gravel,\r\nand 24 inches of fine sand. Maximum depth of water is four feet. The\r\nfiltered water is discharged into a clear-water reservoir by means of\r\ngathering drains and an effluent pipe, and thence to the pump well.\r\nThere are two Worthington engines, each of five million capacity,\r\npumping against a 260-foot lift, into a stand-pipe. The cost of the\r\nworks to December 31, 1880, including interest, was $1,145,476.62;\r\npopulation, 50,143; miles of pipe, 46.87; meters, 40; taps, 1,616;\r\ndaily consumption, 3,262,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n_London_ is supplied with water by the following companies:\r\n\r\n  ==================+===============+=============+==========+===========+\r\n      NAME OF       |  SOURCE OF    |AVERAGE DAILY|NO.

It also takes its supply partly from the Lea River.\r\n\r\nThe West Middlesex Company is above Hampton, and two miles below the\r\nEast London Company’s works. The water is drawn from the river every\r\nday, whatever its state may be; but, in times of exceptionally foul\r\nwater, the intake is reduced as much as possible.\r\n\r\nClose to the West Middlesex Company is the Grand Junction works. Near\r\nthe latter are the works of the Southwark & Vauxhall Company. And at\r\nThames Ditton, two miles further down, are the Lambeth and Chelsea\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe Kent Water Company takes its supply, exclusively, from deep wells\r\nin the chalk. The New River Company takes its supply chiefly from\r\nthe Lea River. It has supplied a large portion of London, for two\r\nhundred and seventy years, through a conduit originally forty miles\r\nin length, which has been shortened by various cuts.\r\n\r\nThe statistics, as per monthly report for July, 1875, were:\r\nPopulation, 3,713,108; miles of pipe, 3,074; daily average\r\nconsumption from Thames, 64,791,000 gallons; daily average\r\nconsumption from other sources, 57,528,000 gallons. Total daily\r\naverage, 122,319,000 gallons.\r\n\r\nThe Capital invested in the supply of water by these eight companies\r\nrepresents a total sum of $51,900,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest pumping engines in use, in 1875, were:\r\n\r\n                                               STEAM CYLINDER.

The cost was estimated at\r\n$51,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe plan proposed by Messrs. Hemans and Hassard is to gather the\r\nwater from the mountains in Cumberland, where a supply equal to 250\r\nmillion gallons daily can be secured for the sum of $61,000,000. The\r\nRivers Pollution Commission were of the opinion, that an ample supply\r\nof wholesome water could be secured from the chalk wells and springs,\r\nwithin a radius not exceeding fifty miles of London.\r\n\r\n_Liverpool_ had in 1874, 493,405 inhabitants. It is supplied with\r\nwater partly by gravitation and partly by pumping from deep wells\r\nin and near the city. The gravitation-works are situated on the\r\nslopes of Rivington Pike, a distance about 33 miles. One-third of\r\nthe storage water is required for compensation purposes. The area of\r\nwater-shed is 10,000 acres; that of the impounding reservoirs and\r\nfilter-beds 549 acres, with a storage capacity of 3¼ billion gallons.\r\nThe ordinary work of the six filter-beds is 14 million gallons daily.\r\n\r\nThe materials used for filtration are: 2½ feet sharp river sand,\r\nclean gravel of the following depths and sizes: 6 inches ⅛-inch\r\ndiameter, 6 inches ¼-inch diameter, 6 inches ½-inch diameter, 6\r\ninches 1-inch diameter, and 6 inches 2-inch diameter; 6 inches of\r\nbroken stone 4-inch diameter, and 12 inches broken stone 6-inch\r\ndiameter. The cost of filtration is $1.37 per million gallons. The\r\nwater, after filtration, flows from the clear water tank through a\r\nmain, 44 inches diameter and 18 miles in length, to the service\r\nreservoir at Prescott, 102 feet lower than the clear water tank; to\r\nbreak the pressure in this length there are two small reservoirs.\r\nFrom Prescott the line is continued by two pipes, one 44 inches and\r\nthe other 36 inches in diameter, a distance of five miles to the\r\nservice reservoirs, which are seven in number, with a water surface\r\narea of 37⅓ acres, and 114 million gallons capacity. They are partly\r\nabove ground and covered. The quantity delivered through the conduit,\r\nis 10⅓ million gallons daily.\r\n\r\nThere are four pumping stations located at the respective wells, with\r\nfive Cornish and five Bolton and Watts’ condensing engines. Four\r\npumping stations have been abandoned on account of the pollution in\r\nwell water. Part of the town is supplied directly from mains and\r\npartly from cisterns. It is now compulsory for all new property to\r\nbe provided with cisterns, and that the overflow-pipe be carried\r\noutside the premises instead of being connected to soil-pipe or\r\nsewer. A special staff of men is employed to make house-to-house\r\ninspection of all water fittings and appliances. The cost of the\r\nwater-works was about 10 million dollars, and is inadequate. They are\r\nnow constructing an artificial lake, 1 mile wide by 5 miles long, for\r\nimpounding the waters of the Vyrnwy River in North Wales, 780 feet\r\nabove the sea level, and 67 miles distant from the city. The area\r\nof water-shed is 22,000 acres. The dam will be a masonry structure,\r\n120 feet extreme depth, and 100 feet wide at base; storage capacity,\r\n1,900 million gallons. The cost is estimated at $15,000,000, and\r\ndaily capacity 52 million gallons.\r\n\r\n_Glasgow._--The present water system was commenced in 1856, and\r\ncompleted in 1859, after the designs of Mr. J. F. Bateman, civil\r\nengineer. The supply is taken from Loch Katrine, including Lochs\r\nDrunkie and Vennachar, with a drainage area of 47,800 acres, and a\r\nstorage capacity of 1,455 million cubic feet. The total length of\r\naqueduct is 25¾ miles, of which 13 are tunneled, 3¾ of iron pipe\r\nacross valleys, and remaining 9 miles of open cuttings and bridges.\r\nThere are 80 distinct tunnels. The capacity of aqueduct is 50 million\r\ngallons per twenty-four hours. The amount required for compensation\r\npurposes is fixed at 40½ million gallons daily, to be discharged\r\ninto the River Teith. The cost of the works was 6 million dollars.\r\nThe water is exceptionally soft, being less than one degree.\r\n\r\n_Manchester._--The new supply was commenced in 1848, designed by Mr.\r\nJ. F. Bateman, civil engineer. The source is in the counties of Derby\r\nand Chester, 777 feet above city datum. There are thirteen storage\r\nand distributing reservoirs, with a water surface of 975½ acres, and\r\ncapacity of 6,458 million gallons. The greatest depth of reservoirs\r\nis 84 feet. The conduit is 18 miles in length. The drainage area is\r\n19,300 acres. Available daily supply is 33 million gallons, of which\r\n13 millions are required for mill-owners. The average rain-fall is\r\n50 inches, and mean available resource of 33 inches. The cost of the\r\nworks was 4 million dollars. The population in 1874 was 750,000;\r\ndaily average consumption 16 million gallons, and 550 miles of pipe.\r\n\r\n_Edinburgh_ derives its supply from springs and brooks flowing from\r\nthe northern slope of the Pentland Mountains. The water is collected\r\nin storage reservoirs, with a capacity of 280 million cubic feet,\r\nthree of which are compensating reservoirs for mill-owners. The\r\nconduit is 8 miles in length, and varies from 20 to 15 inches in\r\ndiameter. The water is distributed directly into mains with an\r\nequalizing cistern on the Castle Hill, 225 feet below the source of\r\nsupply, and 332 feet above tide. The capacity of pipe is 253 cubic\r\nfeet per minute. There were three filter-beds (in 1868) a short\r\ndistance below the reservoir embankment. The sand surface of each\r\nis 90 by 90 feet. The superficial area of the three filters, 24,300\r\nsquare feet; maximum rate of filtration, 85½ U. S. gallons per square\r\nfoot per diem. The spring water is not filtered. The additional works\r\nwere completed in 1868, which increased the supply to 992 cubic feet\r\nper minute, or 10,685,770 U. S. gallons per day.\r\n\r\n_Dublin_ secures its water supply from the Vartry River, 24½ miles\r\ndistant from city, and 692 feet above low water at Dublin. The area\r\nof water-shed is 14,084 acres; the storage capacity, 2,400 million\r\ngallons. The water is conveyed through a 33-inch cast-iron pipe\r\n(with an average fall of 20 feet to the mile) to the Stillogram\r\ndistributing reservoir. There are three receiving tanks on the\r\nline, with self-acting valves to shut off the water in case of pipe\r\nbursting. The distributing reservoirs contain 86 million gallons--are\r\n230 feet above the average head of the city, and 4½ miles distant.\r\nTwo 27-inch pipes distribute the water to the city from this point.\r\nThere were seven filter-beds in 1875, each 215 feet and 115 feet at\r\nthe top and 187 feet by 89 feet at the bottom, and 10 feet deep. The\r\nfiltering material is 6½ feet deep, composed of 2½ feet 4-inch stone,\r\n2 feet gravel, and 2½ feet washed sand. The head on filter-bed was\r\nincreased from 2 to 3 feet to secure larger supply. The total cost\r\nof this new supply was 3 million dollars. The water-rate taxation is\r\n26½d. per pound. The population in 1875 was 330,000; daily average\r\nconsumption, 14 million gallons. All plumber fittings must be\r\ninspected and stamped, for which a fee of two cents is charged. This\r\nconsumption, by careful inspection, was reduced from 19 millions. The\r\nlargest annual rain-fall from 1861 to 1874 was 69.34 inches; minimum,\r\n40.08 inches. Fifteen inches is allowed for evaporation, leaving 25\r\ninches for available supply for the dryest year during this period.\r\n\r\n_Berlin._--The water department is owned by an English company,\r\ncalled the Berlin Water Company, who have had the exclusive privilege\r\nof supplying filtered water as required by the contracts since 1856.\r\nAfter 1881 the Government has the option of taking stock, and should\r\nthe dividends exceed 10 per cent., one-half of the surplus is to go\r\nto the sewerage fund for the proposed sewers.\r\n\r\nThe water is derived mainly from the River Spree, through a canal\r\nreaching to the middle of the river. The pumping station is one\r\nmile outside of the city, in which are located eight double pumping\r\nengines, each pair having two beams, two pumps, and one fly-wheel.\r\nThe first four engines erected have pump-barrels of unequal diameter\r\nand stroke, being respectively, 38 and 21½ inches diameter and 32\r\nand 36 inches stroke. The large barrel was originally used for the\r\ndelivery of the river water to the filter-beds under a pressure not\r\nexceeding 20 feet; the small barrel delivered the filtered water\r\ninto the city under a varying pressure of 90 to 120 feet. As now\r\noperated, the four oldest engines pump the river water into the\r\nsettling or storage basin before filtration; while the other four\r\ndeliver the filtered water directly into the city mains, but the\r\npressure is regulated by a reservoir and stand-pipe along-side of\r\nit. The stand-pipe is double-legged, connected at four points, each\r\nconnection having a valve, except the highest. The highest connection\r\nis 200 feet above the pump-house, the lowest about 115, with others\r\nintermediate. The water of the small reservoir, when full, stands\r\nat about 110 feet above the pump well. There were eleven filters in\r\n1875, with an area of 400,000 square feet. During the summer only\r\neight of the beds are used effectually. They are cleaned in winter\r\nevery month, and every week in summer. One-half of the old sand is\r\nreplaced each time of cleansing with new sand. The average rate\r\nof filtration is 90 gallons per square foot, and maximum rate 120\r\ngallons per square foot per twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe filtering materials consist of 24 inches sharp sand, 3 inches of\r\ncoarse sand, three courses, each 6 inches in depth, of gravel, of the\r\nsize of a pea, hazelnut, and walnut, and 9 inches of granite pieces.\r\nThe head of water on filter is 39 inches.\r\n\r\nFrequently the river water is pumped directly into the filter-beds\r\nwithout subsidence. The stream is very sluggish in its velocity,\r\nbeing held back by locks for the purpose of navigation, the water\r\ndoes not carry sufficient sediment to render subsidence a necessity.\r\nThere are, besides, certain lakes not far above the works through\r\nwhich the river flows, that are effective settling basins. They,\r\nhowever, communicate to the water a dark vegetable tinge.\r\n\r\nThe statistics for 1875 were: Population, 969,000; daily average\r\nconsumption, 12¼ million gallons; number of meters, 6,916. Water-rent\r\nreceipts, for 1875, were $600,000 or 13½ cents per thousand gallons,\r\nand expenses were $376,000, or 8 cents per thousand gallons.\r\n\r\nThe water rents are assessed upon the valuation of the property, with\r\nextra rates for additional water privileges.\r\n\r\nNew works were erected in 1875-’77, with a daily maximum capacity\r\nof 12 million gallons. The source is the “_Tegeler See_.” The water\r\nis collected, by infiltration, in twenty-three cisterns, each having\r\na separate connection to a suction-pipe, 36 inches diameter, 4,000\r\nfeet long, which leads to the pump wells, stationed midway on the\r\nsuction line. The cisterns are circular in form, with two concentric\r\nwalls, the first of stone, the second of brick, with an intervening\r\nspace filled with gravel through which the water percolates. The\r\ninterstices of the stone are small, to prevent the washing in of\r\nsand, in which the wells are made. The water is pumped, by six\r\ncompound engines, into a reservoir of two compartments, whence it\r\nflows into a second pumping station at Charlottenburgh, where four\r\ncompound engines raise the water a second time, with a lift of 125\r\nfeet, into two reservoirs of six million capacity. The water is then\r\ndistributed into the city by two lines, one for the north side, the\r\nother for the south side of the city. The first pumping station is\r\nfour miles from the second works, and the latter six miles from the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n_Vienna_ had a population, in 1875, of 1,007,365. Previous to the\r\napplication of the new supply, in 1873, the city was supplied by\r\nten thousand wells; ten gravitation works, for suburbs, public and\r\nprivate buildings, palaces, etc.; four pumping works--one for large\r\nabattoir, one for the parks, a special supply for the main street,\r\ncalled Ring Strasse, which cost $75,000, besides several small\r\nprivate works, and sixty-six public wells for street sprinkling, etc.\r\nThe first pumping works was erected in 1843, by Emperor Ferdinand\r\nI., and given by him to the city. The total cost, to 1871, of this\r\nservice, was nearly $1,200,000, consisting of three pumping engines,\r\nof Watts’ & Wolf’s designs, with a gross horse-power of 220; three\r\nreservoirs, and a suction and filter canal 27,000 feet long. The\r\nwater is taken from a canal of the Danube, and raised forty-seven\r\nfeet high. The daily delivery was 2,600,000 gallons. In 1864, fifteen\r\nprojects for supplying the city with water were submitted, and the\r\nplan of securing the spring water from the foot of the Alps was\r\nadopted. Work was commenced in 1870, and completed in 1873. The cost\r\nwas nearly $11,000,000. The mean quantity secured daily from the\r\nsprings was originally 37 millions, the maximum 45 millions, and\r\nminimum 5½ millions. The water is collected in three reservoirs,\r\nlocated on mountain ridges, with a capacity of one million gallons.\r\nThe conduit is fifty miles long, and has sixteen tunnels, 5.2 miles\r\nlong, drifted through rock and cemented, and nine and one-half\r\nmiles of masonry bridges. The water is delivered into a reservoir,\r\narched and covered with ground; from this it is led into three other\r\ncovered reservoirs, with a combined capacity of seven millions. The\r\nquantity realized from the springs was not as large as expected,\r\nand additional springs were added to the source at an expense of\r\n$250,000. It is now the intention to increase the main pumping works\r\nfor manufacturing purposes, so as to reduce the supply of spring\r\nwater for domestic use.\r\n\r\n_Hamburg_ had a population, in 1875, of 337,602. The water-works were\r\nerected in 1849. The water is taken from the River Elbe, through an\r\narched canal, to four pump wells (for subsidence of the water) with\r\na combined capacity of 53 million gallons. The water is slightly\r\nturbid, except in floods. The pumping station is two miles above the\r\ncity, and contains four Cornwall and one Wolf engine, with a total\r\nhorse-power of 850. The water is forced through a stand-pipe 240 feet\r\nhigh, under a variable pressure, according to the demand, into the\r\npipes. There are three reservoirs for equalizing the pressure, also\r\nstorage of water. Two of them are stone structures; the other is a\r\ncovered iron tank on a stone foundation 39⅓ feet high. The maximum\r\nconsumption was 19 millions daily; and daily average, for 1875, was\r\n15¼ millions, or 45 gallons per inhabitant. The cost of pumping one\r\nmillion gallons is $20, or $8.33 for one million gallons raised 100\r\nfeet high.\r\n\r\n_Frankfort-on-the-Main_ was supplied by well water. In 1872, a supply\r\nwas brought into the city from the Spessart Mountains, where the\r\nwater from 139 springs were gathered together, and conveyed through\r\nan aqueduct 41 miles long, two miles of which is made of cement 9½\r\nto 18 inches in diameter, 38½ miles of 14½-inch cast-iron pipe,\r\nand ½ mile of canal. The water flows through a syphon tower. There\r\nare two reservoirs--one of 3½ millions, and the other of .8 of a\r\nmillion capacity. The population, in 1875, was 103,136. Daily average\r\nconsumption, 1¾ million gallons; miles of pipe, 64½.\r\n\r\n_Leipsic._--The water-works was built, by the city, in 1866, at a\r\ncost of $900,000. The water is taken from the Pleisse River, through\r\nan arched aqueduct, 656 feet long, to subsiding reservoirs or wells,\r\ntwo miles in diameter, and thirteen feet below the lowest stage in\r\nthe river. The water is pumped into a reservoir, 140 feet lift, by\r\ntwo Wolf engines, with a power of 120 horse-power. The maximum daily\r\nconsumption of water, in 1876, was 2.6 millions, and the minimum was\r\n1.8 million gallons.\r\n\r\n_Stuttgart_ had a population, in 1875, of 107,575. It has two kinds\r\nof supply--one for drinking, that of spring water, and the other\r\nfor manufacturing and general use. For the latter demands, the\r\nsupply is taken partly from the Neckar River, and pumped through\r\nthree artificial filter beds; and partly from lakes, whose water is\r\nconducted, through cast-iron pipes 15,000 feet in length, to five\r\nfilter-beds, and thence into two reservoirs, 145 feet below the lake.\r\nThe reservoir, for the filtered water from the river, is three miles\r\nfrom the pumping station, and 180 feet elevation. Seven million\r\ngallons are used daily.\r\n\r\nThe spring water is conducted through 23.6 miles of pipe, into a\r\nreservoir of 132,010 gallons capacity. The maximum daily consumption\r\nof spring water, in 1875, was 580,800 gallons, and minimum\r\nconsumption 369,600 gallons.\r\n\r\n_Dresden._--The water-works were erected, in 1875, at a cost of\r\n$2,000,000. The available maximum delivery was 11.88 million\r\ngallons per day. The water is taken from the Elbe River, through\r\ntwo cast-iron pipes, 9.8 feet below low water, and conveyed to two\r\nwells, 23 feet in diameter, dug along-side of the river. The water is\r\npumped, by six double engines, with 720 horse-power, through 3,608\r\nfeet of pipe, into a reservoir 197 feet above the pumping station.\r\nThe maximum daily consumption of water, in 1875, was 3.7 million\r\ngallons, and minimum .7 of a million; population, 197,000. In 1876\r\nthere were 2,047 meters in use.\r\n\r\n_Marseilles_ obtains its water supply from the Durance River, at a\r\npoint sixty-two miles from the city. The water is conveyed through\r\nan open canal (excepting the numerous tunnels) with a fall of six\r\ninches per mile. Thirty-four millions, of the 159¾ millions total\r\ndaily ordinary flow of the canal, is considered sufficient for the\r\ncity, the balance being available for irrigation and water-power,\r\nwhile the waste flows into the sea. About one-seventh of the water,\r\nas estimated, is lost by evaporation and filtration. There were five\r\nsettling basins, with a water surface of 220 acres, constructed along\r\nthe line of the canal, designed to increase the deposition of the\r\nheavier particles of sediment by diminishing the velocity of the\r\nwater. Only one of these basins was serviceable in 1868. The largest\r\none was used for a short period only, because of a defect in the\r\nconstruction of the dam; the others were abandoned because of the\r\nneglect in or difficulty of withdrawing the sediment. A costly filter\r\ngallery was built at Longchamp, consisting of two apartments, with\r\na series of arches in the center, forming the bed for the filtering\r\nmaterial and the cover for the collecting reservoir for the filtered\r\nwater. The plan was abandoned in 1866, because of the unusual amount\r\nof sediment carried down by the Durance River, which is estimated at\r\none thousandth part of its volume. In 1868, there were from three to\r\nfour inches of compact mud on the sand beds, and the gallery used for\r\na reservoir only. Subsiding basins have since been constructed. The\r\nrate of filtration, when the gallery was in operation, was 90 cubic\r\nfeet to the square foot, equal to 8,312,940 U. S. gallons per day for\r\nboth filter-beds, or 36 gallons per inhabitant for a population of\r\n230,000.\r\n\r\n_Paris._--Previous to the introduction of the Vanne supply, in 1865,\r\nthe city was supplied from the following sources:\r\n\r\n                                                            CUBIC FEET.\r\n  1.

The Vanne\r\nsupply has, as its source, the rivers Dhuys and Vanne. The conduit is\r\n83 miles long; its capacity 20 millions daily.\r\n\r\nThere are projected works (1876) to secure the waters of the Mame\r\nthat will increase the daily supply 25 millions.\r\n\r\nThe waters are generally very impure, chiefly obtained from navigable\r\nstreams. None of the water is filtered. There are two covered\r\nreservoirs--Ménilmontant and Montrouge--of vaulted arches, after\r\nthe Roman style. The pumping works are located in the city. The\r\ndaily average consumption, in 1868, was 55,861,472 gallons, or 33\r\ngallons per head. Water is distributed throughout Paris, but not\r\nmore than one-fifth of the houses have water connection. The others\r\nare supplied in carts and buckets, carried by men to the door. About\r\n7,000 men, principally natives of Auvergne, are employed thusly. It\r\nis a custom to let the water run for three hours, from the public\r\nfountains, in the morning to cleanse the streets.\r\n\r\n_Bombay._--The water-works were commenced in 1856. The source is in\r\nthe valley of the Goper, where the Vehar impounding reservoir, with\r\na storage capacity of 12,900 million gallons is located. The maximum\r\ndepth of the reservoir is 80 feet, with an area of 1,394 acres. There\r\nare three dams--one 835, one 555, and the other 936 feet long. The\r\nextreme height of first dam is 84 feet, inner slope 3 to 1, and the\r\nouter 2½ to 1. The embankments were made in layers of six inches.\r\nThe top width of this dam, which carries a roadway, is 24 feet. The\r\npuddle walls are 10 feet wide at the top, and have a batter of 1 in 8\r\non each side. The trenches, for the foundations, were excavated into\r\nthe solid basalt below the surface rock. The slopes and tops of all\r\nthe embankments are covered with stone pitching 12 inches in depth,\r\nwith another 12 inches of broken stone underneath. The waste weir is\r\n358 feet long, with a top width of 20 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe succeeding articles, viz.:\r\n\r\n  1. The Geology of Hamilton County;\r\n  2.

It is computed that this group of strata\r\nattains a thickness of 47,000 feet in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Potsdam sandstone, the first member of the Silurian system, rests\r\nunconformably on the Eozoic rocks wherever the two are found in\r\ncontact. This, as its name implies, is a sandstone, and is the first\r\nproduct of the invasion of the Eozoic continent by the ancient ocean,\r\nand the action of the shore waves upon the cliffs and surface.\r\n\r\nIt has been reached in the deep borings made at Columbus, Louisville,\r\nand St. Louis. Neither the Eozoic or Potsdam stones are exposed in\r\nany part of Ohio. Resting on the Potsdam stone, is a formation called\r\ncalciferous sand-rock, so named in New York because there it consists\r\nof a mixture of lime and sand. This formation holds the lead of\r\ncentral and eastern Missouri.\r\n\r\nTrenton limestone, with its underlying strata of chazy, Black River,\r\nand bird’s-eye limestones, rests on the calciferous sand-rock, and\r\nforms a calcareous mass of 300 to 600 feet in thickness. It is\r\nexposed in New York, Canada, Lake Superior, and Upper Mississippi,\r\nwhere one of its members, the Galena limestone, claims special notice\r\nas being the repository of all that rupture.\r\n\r\nUpon the Trenton rests the Hudson group, consisting of the Hudson\r\nRiver and Utica slates, and composed of mixed calcareous and\r\nargillaceous sediments. This group is regarded as an equivalent\r\nto the blue limestones, or Cincinnati group, which are of special\r\ninterest to the inhabitants of Ohio, inasmuch as they are the lowest\r\nrocks exposed within our territory.\r\n\r\nThese older rocks are brought to the surface by an axis of upheaval,\r\nreaching from Nashville to Lake Erie. They have been still further\r\nexposed by the cutting down of the valley of the Ohio, near\r\nCincinnati, where 800 feet of the series are exposed to view. The\r\nwells on the upper Cumberland, in Kentucky, were sunk in rocks of the\r\nHudson age. The earthy limestones of the Hudson period indicate a\r\nshallow and retreating sea, an approach to land conditions, and the\r\ncompletion of one circle of deposition.\r\n\r\nThe rocks next in order are:\r\n\r\n  The Oneida conglomerate marks a period of land subsidence, or water\r\n  elevation. It is composed of coarse materials torn from the coast\r\n  by shore waves. The system is found in central New York.\r\n\r\n  The Medina sandstone.--A period of mechanical sediments. In New\r\n  York it is 300 to 400 feet in thickness. It has been struck in\r\n  borings for oil in northern Ohio, but not well marked.\r\n\r\n  Clinton Group, in Ohio, is represented by a limestone 15 to 20 feet\r\n  thick, an outcrop following the line of junction of the Lower and\r\n  Upper Silurian.\r\n\r\n  Niagara Group is above the Clinton and occupies a wide-spread and\r\n  more important formation, composed of equal masses of limestone and\r\n  shale. This is the rock that underlies Chicago. The Niagara and\r\n  Clinton overlie the Cincinnati Group.\r\n\r\n  Salina is the formation from which the salt is obtained at\r\n  Syracuse. In northern Ohio it overlies the Niagara, and contains\r\n  the gypsum of Sandusky. This deposition marks the era of a retiring\r\n  sea, which left a series of shallow basins that became great\r\n  evaporating pans.\r\n\r\n  Helderburg group is the surface rock of a large area in Ohio, and\r\n  forms a summit of the Upper Silurian, and completes a circle of\r\n  sedimentary formation corresponding, in a way, with that of the\r\n  Lower Silurian.\r\n\r\n  The Trenton groups are nearly pure carbonate of lime, while those\r\n  of the Niagara series--Clinton, Niagara, and Waterlime--are highly\r\n  magnesian.\r\n\r\nThe Devonian age contains many strange forms of ancient life. In the\r\nMississippi Valley, the Devonian strata are mostly calcareous, and\r\nmuch thinner than in New York and Pennsylvania, showing plainly that\r\nhere, as in eastern Canada, open sea prevailed during this age, and\r\nthat the Cincinnati Arch formed a land surface probably throughout\r\nall the Devonian ages. The Devonian system comprise:\r\n\r\n  Oriskany sandstones.\r\n\r\n  Corniferous limestone.--An open sea deposit. The average thickness\r\n  in Ohio is 100 feet, and forms two belts of outcrop on opposite\r\n  sides of the Cincinnati arch. The rock contains 20 per cent. of\r\n  magnesia. Fragments of land plants and limbs of trees are found in\r\n  this group.\r\n\r\n  Hamilton group.--A soft, blue limestone in Ohio.\r\n\r\n  Huron shale--exhibits a prevailing black color, and contains 10 per\r\n  cent. of combustible matter. The line of its outcrop is marked by\r\n  oil and gas springs. It is exposed in Kentucky and Tennessee, on\r\n  both sides of Cincinnati anticlinal. It contains a large amount of\r\n  carbon, derived from sea-weeds.\r\n\r\n  Erie shales is the name given to the Huron shale in northern Ohio\r\n  and Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nThe carboniferous system is the highest group of rocks found in Ohio,\r\nand holds nearly all the beds of coal. As this period is not relative\r\nto Hamilton County, we shall only briefly refer to it.\r\n\r\nAt the period of the formation of the lowest bed of coal, the\r\nlevel of the carboniferous continent would seem to have been the\r\nhighest; for when the stratum of bituminous matter had accumulated\r\nto the depth of a few feet, it was submerged by water, that brought\r\nshales and sandstone, and spread them in layers of many feet in\r\nthickness above it, before the requisite conditions were reached\r\nfor the formation of another stratum. The intervals of repose, when\r\nthe surface of the land was nearly at a level with the sea, were\r\nmarked by the carbonaceous matter, and the thickness of each stratum\r\nmeasures the length of time during which this state of quiescence\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nThe changes of level were apparently all in one direction, that of\r\nsubmergence. During the epoch of the coal measure, the surface of\r\nthe land and at the sea level, while the first stratum of coal was\r\nforming, was depressed until there had been deposited upon it a\r\nseries of strata, which measured in Ohio, before being eroded, fully\r\n2,000 feet in thickness, and included at least twelve workable seams\r\nof coal, with a great number of thinner ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Works Weather Chart for 1880\r\n\r\nFrom Signal Service Records]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the formation of the highest coal-beds, the Alleghany\r\nMountain system was elevated, and an area including most of the\r\nStates of our Union was raised above the ocean, never again,\r\nto the present time, submerged. The anthracite coal basins of\r\nPennsylvania were once a part of the Alleghany coal-field, but were\r\nisolated by the upheaval and erosion of the mountain ridges; and by\r\nthis disturbance, all the rocks were more or less metamorphosed, and\r\nmost of the volatile ingredients of the coal driven off, leaving it\r\nin the condition of anthracite.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEPOSITS OF DRIFT.\r\n\r\nThe period immediately following the Tertiary age [but separated from\r\nit by we know not how many years] presents a complete change in the\r\nphysical condition, that during this time the pervading warmth of the\r\nTertiary was changed to an Arctic cold. While, in the former age,\r\nthe climate of our Southern States was carried to Greenland; in the\r\nlatter, or drift period, the present Greenland was brought as far\r\nsouth as the Ohio. This was when we had our icebergs or glacial age.\r\nThe gravel, the bowlders, and an unstratified clay thickly studded\r\nwith small fragments of rock, are the glacial surface-covering.\r\nMingled with these are found many pebbles and bowlders of crystalline\r\nrock, such as are found north of the great lakes.\r\n\r\nThe finding of large bowlders in fields are the deposit of icebergs\r\nthat once floated over our country. The glaziers reached as far as\r\nCincinnati, planing, grinding down, smoothing all rock surfaces, and\r\nexcavating the basins of our great lakes. The retreat of the glaciers\r\nleft clay and bowlders and a great inland sea of fresh water, filling\r\nbasins, before occupied by ice, 500 feet above the present surface of\r\nLake Erie. At a later period, by continental elevation or the removal\r\nof barriers to drainage, the water level was gradually depressed\r\nuntil the inland sea was reduced to the comparative insignificance of\r\nour great lakes.\r\n\r\nThe descent of the water by motion of the waves, cut the well-marked\r\nterraces and edges.\r\n\r\n\r\nCINCINNATI ANTICLINAL.\r\n\r\nThe term, Cincinnati Group, is now applied to the blue limestone\r\nseries, and is an equivalent, in the geological nomenclature, to the\r\nHudson Group of New York.\r\n\r\nIts thickness is estimated at 1,000 feet. The line of upheaval passes\r\nfrom the south line of Tennessee, with a direction a little east of\r\nnorth, through Cincinnati to Lake Erie. Throughout its whole length\r\nthe strata are raised in a distinct arch, from which they dip away,\r\non the one side under the Alleghany coal-field, on the other beneath\r\nthe coal basin of Indiana and Illinois.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of this axis of elevation is nearly parallel with that\r\nof the folds of the Alleghanies; that the date of its upheaval was\r\nsubsequent to the carboniferous, and anterior to the Triassic period.\r\nThe line, north of Cincinnati, extends from the Ohio River in a\r\ndirection a little east of north to the lake shore, between Sandusky\r\nand Toledo. In consequence of the erosion, which all the region\r\nbordering the Cincinnati Arch has suffered, the line of the axis\r\npresents no conspicuous topographical features. About Cincinnati the\r\nsummit of the arch has been much more deeply and extensively removed\r\nthan farther north, yet this is still higher than its northern\r\nprolongation.\r\n\r\nThere is every reason to believe, therefore, that this was originally\r\nthe highest part of that portion of the arch within Ohio, and, in\r\ncommon with the Blue Grass district of Kentucky, the blue limestone\r\narea about Cincinnati is the most elevated portion of the ridge; that\r\nwhich has been the longest above the sea level and suffered most from\r\nsurface erosion. We find here a line or tract from which the strata\r\ndipped on both sides in opposite directions.\r\n\r\nThe strata, that are found in the tops of the Cincinnati hills, can\r\nbe followed to the eastern side of Brown County, where they seem to\r\ndisappear beneath the river with a marked easterly dip; while below\r\nCincinnati, near Madison, Indiana, the same beds are carried beneath\r\nthe river by a strong westerly dip. The Cincinnati anticlinal, unlike\r\nthe folds of the Appalachian system, generally has its longer slope\r\nto the westward, and its steeper descent towards the east, estimated\r\nat 35 feet per mile. In the western half of the State, and especially\r\nalong the summit of the Cincinnati Arch, the dip of the strata is\r\nstrongly northward, amounting to about 1,000 feet between the Ohio\r\nand the lake. The surface of the Cincinnati Group is in Highland\r\nCounty, about 500 feet above Lake Erie, while on the lake shore it is\r\nnearly 400 feet below the lake. These figures do not represent the\r\nentire dip, inasmuch as the crown of the arch is extensively eroded\r\nwhere it crosses the Ohio in Clermont County. The Cincinnati section\r\nwas originally crowned, there is little reason to doubt, with the\r\nLebanon beds [the highest rocks of the Cincinnati group] in whole or\r\nin part, which suffered by erosion, forming our valleys of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the blue limestone, near Lebanon, is 441 feet above\r\nLake Erie, while the same rocks were found in the Columbus well to be\r\n721 feet below Lake Erie, a dip of 1,167 feet in a distance of about\r\n70 miles by an air line, or 16.6 feet per mile.\r\n\r\nToward the northern extremity of the arch the dip is north-west and\r\nmore rapid, the strata descending under the Michigan coal-field.\r\nNear the lake-shore the minimum dip is 20 feet to the mile, while on\r\nthe Ohio it is 40 feet. The easterly dip is a succession of steps or\r\nwaves beneath the trough of the Alleghany coal-field, the axis of\r\nwhich passes near or beyond our eastern border. This dip is so great\r\nthat the lowest stratum exposed on the crown of the Cincinnati arch\r\nis on the eastern side of the State, buried about 2,000 feet beneath\r\nthe surface. East of the Ohio all the rocks rise again, and not\r\nonly the lowest exposed in our State, but even those which underlie\r\nthem, crop out on the flanks and summits of the Alleghany Mountains.\r\nAlong the Kentucky River from Frankfort to Nicholasville, and at\r\nMurfreesboro, Tennessee, the basal portion of the blue limestone\r\nseries is exposed to view; and if it was originally as thick at these\r\npoints as elsewhere, not less than 800 to 1,000 feet of the upper\r\npart have been removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAMILTON COUNTY.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking there are no hills in Hamilton County, the surface\r\nbeing all referable to the tablelands and to the valleys worn in\r\nthem. The elevated lands, called hills, are merely isolated remnants\r\nof the old plateau, which have, thus far, escaped the long continued\r\ninundation. This isolation is effected by the Little Miami, the Ohio,\r\nthe Millcreek Valleys, and the abandoned channel of the Great Miami.\r\n\r\nThe bedded rocks of the Cincinnati section are as follows:\r\n\r\n  Lebanon beds,            293 feet  { Hill quarry beds,   125 feet\r\n  Cincinnati beds proper,  425 feet--{ Eden shales,        250 feet\r\n  Mt. Pleasant beds,        50 feet  { River quarry,        50 feet\r\n                           ---\r\n              Total,       768 feet\r\n\r\nThe Mt. Pleasant beds are so named because, at the Ohio River bed at\r\nthis point, they are the lowest of the exposed beds, and underlie the\r\nlowest beds at Cincinnati by 50 feet. The Cincinnati beds have their\r\ninferior limit at low water of the Ohio, and for an upper boundary\r\nthe highest stratum found in the Cincinnati hills. Their greatest\r\nelevation, above low water-mark, is 450 feet. The Eden, or middle\r\nshale, is so named because of its prominence in Eden Park hills. It\r\nhas no economical value, indeed its relation to economical interests\r\nare mainly in the way of disadvantages to be overcome, because of\r\nits instable character. Of the 250 feet not more than one foot in\r\nten is limestone, the remainder being shales, clay, or soapstones.\r\nThese shales have scarcely tenacity enough to hold their place in\r\nsteep descents, still less, when they have been removed from their\r\noriginal beds, can they be made to cohere, and they form treacherous\r\nfoundations for buildings erected, or for roadways constructed upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe strata of river quarry-beds are comparatively but little exposed.\r\nA moderate amount of building-stone of superior quality is taken from\r\nthe Covington quarries. But little can be burned into lime, but the\r\nconcretions constitute a hydraulic lime of great energy.\r\n\r\nThe Lebanon beds, in contrast to the Mt. Pleasant beds, are the\r\nhighest of the Cincinnati group, and the location determine their\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe drift formations are divided into--\r\n\r\n1. Drift deposits of the highlands and slopes.\r\n\r\n2. Drift deposits of the lowlands and valley drift-beds.\r\n\r\nThe upland drift has no uniformity in the order of formations aside\r\nfrom the monotonous deposits of yellow clay, which, when filled\r\nwith water, becomes quicksand. But little clean gravel occurs in\r\nthe upland, and bowlders also are unfrequent. The drift clays\r\ncome largely from the waste of blue limestone effected by glacial\r\nattrition, while the natural soil has the same origin, except the\r\nwork of disintegration has been done by the slow action of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe lowland drift consists of the following terraces, in a descending\r\norder:\r\n\r\n                                          FEET.\r\n  Soil                                    2 to 5\r\n  Gravel and sand with seams of loam,    40 to 60\r\n  Brick clay with sand and loam,         20 to 30\r\n  Buried soil with trees, leaves, etc.,   5 to 10\r\n  Gravel and clay,                        5 to 10\r\n                                         --   ---\r\n                       Total,            72   115\r\n\r\nThe gravel of the Ohio differs from the Miami in being largely\r\ncomposed of sandstone pebbles instead of limestone.\r\n\r\nA formation of local occurrences, known as the blue or Springfield\r\nclay, is found in a few places, but in limited, vertical and\r\nhorizontal, extent. The greatest thickness, of more than 30 feet, is\r\nfound on north Pearl Street, above Pike.\r\n\r\nThe broad valley, now occupied in part by Millcreek, extending from\r\nthe present valley of the Great Miami at Hamilton to the Clifton\r\nhills, just north of Cincinnati, separates into two branches, one\r\npassing to the north and east of the city, and entering the valley\r\nof the Little Miami between Red Bank station and Plainville, while\r\nthe other branch is the present valley of the Millcreek. There are no\r\nrocky barriers (nothing, in fact, but the same drift terraces that\r\nmake the walls of its present course) to shut out the Great Miami\r\nfrom entering the Ohio valley at the same points where the Little\r\nMiami and Millcreek enter. There is every reason to believe that this\r\nwas once its course.\r\n\r\nAnother of the earlier courses of the Great Miami, is now occupied by\r\nthe Dry Fork of the White Water; still a third of the old channels\r\nis found near Cleves, Miami Township, where the Miami approaches\r\nwithin one-half mile of the Ohio, but is blocked from entering it by\r\na ridge 150 to 175 feet, composed of glacial drift, and instead makes\r\na circuitous route of 10 miles for an outlet.\r\n\r\nThe well of Timothy Kirby, in Cumminsville, developed the following\r\nborings:\r\n\r\n                                                       FEET.\r\n  Soil and brick clay,                                   12\r\n  Sand,                                                   4\r\n  Blue clay with gravel,                                 30\r\n  Gravel,                                                19\r\n  Coarse sand,                                            3\r\n  Sand, with fragments of bituminous coal,               11\r\n  Blue clay with gravel.

The lowest limit of this mass of stone is at low water of\r\nthe Ohio River, at Cincinnati, from which point it anticlines in all\r\ndirections. There are crevices or pockets, however, in which water\r\nhas been accidentally found. The following are examples:\r\n\r\n  ===================+==============+=====================+======+\r\n                     |              |                     |      |\r\n    NAME OF OWNER.   |  LOCATION.   |     FORMATION.      | DEPTH|\r\n                     |              |                     |  IN  |\r\n                     |              |                     | FEET.|\r\n  -------------------+--------------+---------------------+------+\r\n  John Kaufman.      |Vine Street.  |Blue clay.           |  25  |\r\n                     |              |Sand and quicksand.  |  73  |\r\n                     |              |Blue clay.           |  55  |\r\n                     |              |Quicksand and gravel.|  35  |\r\n                     |              |Limestone.           |  25  |\r\n                     |              |                     |      |\r\n                     |              |Soil and quicksand.  |  75  |\r\n  Holder’s Tannery.  |Colerain Pike.|Clay.                |  90  |\r\n                     |              |Limestone.           |  50  |\r\n                     |              |                     |      |\r\n                     |              |Alluvial and gravel. |  80  |\r\n  Freiburg & Workum. |Main Street.  |Limestone.           | 170  |\r\n  ===================+==============+=====================+======+\r\n\r\n    ===================+======+========+==========+===========\r\n                       |      | TOTAL  | DIAMETER |\r\n      NAME OF OWNER.   | DEPTH| DEPTH  |    OF    |WHERE WATER\r\n                       |  IN  |OF WELL |  BORING  | WAS FOUND.\r\n                       | FEET.|IN FEET.|IN INCHES.|\r\n    -------------------+------+--------+----------+-----------\r\n    John Kaufman.      |  25  |        |          |\r\n                       |  73  |        |          |\r\n                       |  55  |        |          |\r\n                       |  35  |        |          |\r\n                       |  25  |   215  |    3½    |In crevice.\r\n                       |      |        |          |\r\n                       |  75  |        |          |\r\n    Holder’s Tannery.  |  90  |        |          |\r\n                       |  50  |   215  |    3½    |\r\n                       |      |        |          |\r\n                       |  80  |        |          |\r\n    Freiburg & Workum. | 170  |   250  |    --    |In crevice.\r\n    ===================+======+========+==========+===========\r\n\r\nThe waters of the above wells are necessarily hard, although that\r\nat Holder’s tannery is used for all purposes. The water at John\r\nKaufman’s is very turbid. The Freiburg & Workum well was originally\r\na dug one, forty feet deep, but the quantity was insufficient. When\r\nthey struck the present source, they destroyed the adjoining surface\r\nwells of Hoffheimer Bros.\r\n\r\nA number of failures to secure water in this limestone formation is\r\non record, but we can notice only a few.\r\n\r\nAt Rasche Bros., tannery, on Plum Street, opposite Bank Street, they\r\ndrove a 6 inch well through, respectively, 16 feet of clay, 4 feet\r\nquicksand, 15 feet blue clay, 70 feet yellow clay, and solid quarry\r\nrock. A pump was then inserted but was inoperative on account of the\r\nlarge amount of sand. They continued the boring to 185 feet, striking\r\nclay and soapstone, but found no water, and abandoned the undertaking.\r\n\r\nWm. Kirkup & Son, Pearl and Ludlow, bored 60 feet into rock, for\r\nwater, without success. At Maddox, Hobart & Co.’s rectifying\r\nestablishment, they have pierced the rock 150 feet, but found no\r\nwater up to this date. At Weber’s brewery, on McMicken Avenue, an\r\nattempt was made to get water in the rock, and abandoned, after\r\nboring to a depth of 458 feet.\r\n\r\nThe Cincinnati group is about 1,000 feet in thickness of blue\r\nlimestone, forming, almost exclusively, the rocks of Hamilton County,\r\nalthough an outcrop of the oil stratum has been struck in the wells\r\nof the Cincinnati Coffin Company and White Mills Distillery. At the\r\nformer establishment, flowing gas was found at a depth of 82 feet.\r\nAnother well was started, and at the same depth gas was discovered.\r\nThe boring of the latter was then continued into the rock to the\r\ndepth of 168 feet, when water was found. The water was analyzed by\r\nProf. Wayne with the following result:\r\n\r\n                          GRAINS IN EACH GALLON.\r\n\r\n  Chloride of Sodium              33.21\r\n  Chloride of Calcium              4.20\r\n  Chloride of Magnesia             1.17\r\n  Sulphate of Lime                10.64\r\n  Carbonate of Lime               26.64\r\n  Carbonate of Magnesia            3.15\r\n  Oxide of Iron                      12\r\n\r\nThe gas burnt out in a few days.\r\n\r\nWhite Mills Distillery has four wells, from 4 to 6 inches in\r\ndiameter, and 220 to 235 feet in depth, bored through, respectively,\r\n50 feet of clay, 40 feet clay and quicksand, and balance _soapstone_\r\nor shale and limestone, where water was found in a crevice, highly\r\ncharged with gas and very brackish.\r\n\r\nThe following wells secure their water from drift terraces:\r\n\r\n  =================+=============+===================+========+\r\n                   |             |                   |        |\r\n        OWNER.     |  LOCATION.  |    FORMATION.     | DEPTH  |\r\n                   |             |                   |IN FEET.|\r\n  -----------------+-------------+-------------------+--------+\r\n                   |             |Fill.              |    30  |\r\n  Hulsman          |W.

The porous nature of this formation, with the\r\nassistance of a level surface plain, absorbs a very large percentage\r\nof the rain-fall, and produces a fertile subterranean water supply,\r\nwhose depth varies from 30 to 200 feet.\r\n\r\nThere are in this vicinity about 250 wells that secure the water\r\nfrom this source. The water is strongly impregnated with iron and\r\nmagnesia--a ferruginous decomposition from the fossil drift-wood\r\nfound in this formation. The availability of these wells is in\r\nproportion to the capacity of the respective pumps attached to them,\r\nbut their combined requirements have had no apparent effect, at\r\npresent, on the source. Yet the fact can not be disputed, that this\r\ndrift supply of water is a very limited one.\r\n\r\nThe practical experience in London and Liverpool substantiate the\r\nabove fact, for there the underground sources have been materially\r\nlessened by the demands made upon them, notwithstanding they are the\r\nrichest resources of this nature, and vastly superior to ours.\r\n\r\nProf. Orton, of the Ohio Agricultural College, in a valuable paper\r\non the “Relations of Geology to the Water Supply of the Country,”\r\nrefers to the purity of the drift water in the south-western part\r\nof the State. He says: “The broad and fertile terraces of the river\r\nvalleys constitute, especially in the south-western corner of the\r\nState (Ohio), the most attractive and most valuable portion of its\r\narea. They consist of sand and gravel in large measures, and to this\r\nstructure they owe their chief attraction. _But this same structure\r\nrenders them unfit to be used for the water supply of the towns\r\nbuilt upon them_; for, although an abundance of clear and sparkling\r\nwater can easily be reached, it must not only be looked upon with\r\nsuspicion, but must be positively condemned as unsafe.\r\n\r\n“These gravel-beds are as porous as a sieve, and there is\r\nindisputable proof of the free communication of the water sheet\r\nand all the receptacles of impurity that the surface of the ground\r\ncontains. The only relief is found in the fact that the water sheet\r\nis also in free communication with the rivers, rising and falling\r\nwith them; _but_ even _this_ does not free the wells from the\r\npoisonous effects of the filth soakage from above. Geology turns over\r\nto sanitary science the conclusion, that the drift wells of central\r\nand south-western Ohio are, in all densely populated districts, small\r\ncities, towns, villages, and hamlets--even in those containing no\r\nmore than a dozen houses--_utterly unfit for human use_.”\r\n\r\nThe above facts are applicable to all the drift formation, including\r\nthat portion protected from immediate filth soakage of blue clay\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nA recent examination of our sewerage system, by the U. S. Census\r\nBureau, developed the fact that Cincinnati is polluting its\r\nsubterraneous soil, to an alarming degree, by the vault system. That\r\nno city has so neglected the sanitary necessity of tapping the sewers\r\nfor house drainage than Cincinnati; that this nature of carelessness\r\nwas the cause of Memphis’ sad fate, which we have escaped because\r\nour soil is of sand and gravel, and susceptible of natural drainage.\r\nYet through this same soil passes the water that is used by some 250\r\nwell-owners, still the use of this water is increasing.\r\n\r\nLondon was originally supplied by shallow wells in gravel-beds of 10\r\nto 20 feet in depth, and the direction of its growth was controlled\r\nby this water-bearing strata, until the establishment of the New\r\nRiver Water Company in 1600. The Public Health Act of 1872 gives the\r\nsanitary authorities power to close these wells.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTESIAN WELLS.\r\n\r\nBeneath the Cincinnati group are the calciferous sand-rock and\r\nPotsdam sandstone, which are porous and water bearing, but they rise\r\nto the surface nowhere in our State. They have been reached, however,\r\nat this point in several of the deep well-borings, and flowing water\r\nof sulpho-saline nature was found, at the following locations:\r\n\r\n  =========================+====================+==========+=============+\r\n                           |                    |          |             |\r\n       NAME OF OWNER.      |     LOCATION.      |  DEPTH   | SIZE OF BORE|\r\n                           |                    | IN FEET. |  IN INCHES. |\r\n  -------------------------+--------------------+----------+-------------+\r\n  Rabe’s Distillery        | Cumminsville.      |   1,400  |    4½       |\r\n  Millcreek   “            | West of Millcreek. |   1,440  |    4½       |\r\n  Cincinnati Gas Co        | West Front Street. |   1,360  |    4½       |\r\n       “      “            |  “     “     “     |   1,360  |    4½       |\r\n       “      “            | Eastern Avenue.    |   1,475  |    6        |\r\n  Moerlein’s Brewery       | North Elm Street.  |   2,408  |    4        |\r\n  Keck’s Fertilizing Works | Cumminsville.      |   1,380  |    --       |\r\n  =========================+====================+==========+=============+\r\n\r\n    =========================+==========+==========+========+============\r\n                             |          |          |        |  CAPACITY\r\n         NAME OF OWNER.      |  DEPTH   | PRESSURE | TEMPER-|  PER HOUR\r\n                             | IN FEET. |  IN LBS. | ATURE. | IN GALLONS.\r\n    -------------------------+----------+----------+--------+------------\r\n    Rabe’s Distillery        |   1,400  |    35    |   --   |    6,000\r\n    Millcreek   “            |   1,440  |    45    |   --   |   16,000\r\n    Cincinnati Gas Co        |   1,360  |    41    |   60   |    8,300\r\n         “      “            |   1,360  |    40    |   60   |    8,300\r\n         “      “            |   1,475  |    52    |   61   |   30,000\r\n    Moerlein’s Brewery       |   2,408  |    --    |   62   |   24,000\r\n    Keck’s Fertilizing Works |   1,380  |    --    |   60   |\r\n    =========================+==========+==========+========+============\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Gen.

Pfeffer, drove a 6-inch\r\n  iron tube with a heavy sinker, a few feet at a time, through 123\r\n  feet of drift, into limestone. A sand-pump was used to remove the\r\n  loose formation. This portion was completed August 2d, 11 A. M.\r\n\r\n  August 2.--Commenced drilling a 4½-inch hole through the stone\r\n  formation at an average rate of 33 feet per 24 hours, and continued\r\n  to a depth of 425 feet, when the diameter of the hole was reduced\r\n  to 4⅜ inches. The drilling was then continued, at the rate of 29\r\n  feet per 24 hours, until the 28th of August, when the socket pulled\r\n  out of pole attached to sinker at bottom of well, and at the same\r\n  moment the top pole, attached to chain on drilling beam, broke\r\n  and fell into the well along-side of the sinker. This accident was\r\n  repaired September 7th, and drilling resumed, at rate of 20 feet\r\n  per 24 hours, until a depth of 1,025 feet was reached, October 11,\r\n  1880, when the drill broke. Resumed work, at rate of 12 feet per\r\n  24 hours, until November 5, 1880, when a depth of 1,265 feet was\r\n  reached. At the depth of 1,225 feet, the well was tested by sinking\r\n  a 4-inch pipe into the well with a bag at lower end to fit tightly\r\n  into the 4½-inch bore. When the pipe reached a depth of 15 feet\r\n  below the 6-inch tubing, the water flowed over the top of the pipe\r\n  at surface, showing a leak around the bottom of the pipe where it\r\n  was bedded in the rock.\r\n\r\n  November 8th.--Tested well, and found a pressure of 30 lbs. per\r\n  square inch, and a flow of 90 gallons of water per minute.\r\n\r\n  February 17, 1881.--When testing well No. 2, the gauge was placed\r\n  on this one, which showed only 15 lbs. The bore was then increased\r\n  to 4½ inches, and drilling continued to a depth of 1,360 feet, the\r\n  last 40 feet being only 3½ inches in diameter. The additional 125\r\n  feet was through alternate formations of sand and limestone; the\r\n  last 10 feet through a hard flinty formation. Boring into this\r\n  last formation increased the pressure to 41 lbs., and the flow to\r\n  200,000 gallons per day. The outlay of the two wells is placed at\r\n  $8,000.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the Moerlein artesian well, by Prof. Wayne, gave the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n                                GRAINS IN ONE\r\n                                U.

This water-shed forms a\r\nrange of highlands that slope by long and easy descent to the Ohio in\r\nthe south, more rapidly to the lake in the north. _This water-shed\r\nin its relief is almost insignificant_, its average altitude being\r\nonly 500 feet above the lake, its highest point rising perhaps 1,000\r\nfeet above the bottom valley of the Ohio. Our topographical features\r\nmay therefore be described of a plain, slightly raised along a line\r\ntraversing it from north-east to south-west.\r\n\r\nThe following altitudes will show the topography of the northern\r\ndivide.

The water-sheds, with which we\r\nare particularly interested, are found in the counties of Shelby,\r\nMercer, and Auglaize, where we have the water-gap of the head-waters\r\nof the St. Marys and Auglaize, as feeders of the Maumee River with\r\nthe Wabash and Big Beaver Rivers on one side, and the Great Miami\r\non this side; with another gap, between the Miami and Mad Rivers,\r\nand the Scioto River, found in Logan and Hardin Counties, in which\r\nthe highest points of the State are found viz., 1,000 feet above low\r\nwater in the Ohio River. These streams descend very rapidly to the\r\nlevel plateau (500 feet above the Ohio River) passing over lime and\r\nmagnesia rocks, through swampy lands and “cat-head prairies,” the\r\nlatter composed largely of vegetable accumulations. The population,\r\nthrough which the Great Miami and Mad rivers flow, is approximately\r\n360,000.\r\n\r\nThe available resources of the Big Beaver, Wabash, and St. Mary’s\r\nwater-sheds are collected in St. Mary’s Reservoir, a lake of 47,000\r\nacres, for feeding the Miami Canal north; while Lake Laramie in\r\nShelby County, and Lewistown Reservoir in Logan County gather the\r\nwaters of the Miami, and being at the summit level, feed the canal\r\nboth north and south. This level is 519 feet above low water in Ohio\r\nRiver, St. Mary’s 424 feet, Eden Park Reservoir at Cincinnati 235\r\nfeet, and Third Street Reservoir 173 feet. The distance in air line\r\nfrom Cincinnati to St. Mary’s is about 95 miles, to Lewistown over\r\n100 miles.\r\n\r\nThe waters of all the streams named present those features that\r\nexperience considers most objectionable for a gravity supply, namely:\r\n\r\n  “1st. In the calcareous nature of the soil, producing hardness of\r\n  water.\r\n\r\n  “2d. In the low and level plateau of water-sheds from which a\r\n  minimum surface flow can be realized, requiring storage reservoirs\r\n  of large surface area, that are objectionable, because; 1. The loss\r\n  of water by evaporation: and 2. The liability to stagnation of\r\n  water and propagation of vegetation.\r\n\r\n  “3d. The streams are fed by the drainage from richly manured farms,\r\n  and the water polluted by vegetation of the swampy lands, and\r\n  the sewage of a large and growing population. This condition is\r\n  intensified, when we consider the proportional size of the streams\r\n  to the amount of pollution, and the fact that the most perfect\r\n  means of filtration would not suffice to make the water wholesome.\r\n\r\n  “4th. The available resources of these water-sheds are now used\r\n  for feeding the Miami Canal, from which a number of mill-owners\r\n  secure their power, whose rights must be protected.\r\n\r\n  “5th. The insufficient elevation of the sources for securing a fair\r\n  hydrostatic water pressure, and their extreme distance, causing\r\n  loss of head by long conduit, and enormous cost for construction,\r\n  for conveying unwholesome water.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRIPARIAN RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nThe compensation to millers by the Manchester and Liverpool\r\nWater-Works was fixed by Parliament at one third of the available\r\nrain-fall. Nearly one-half of the present capacity of the Glasgow\r\nsupply is used by mill-owners.\r\n\r\nOn this subject John W. Erwin, resident engineer of the Ohio State\r\nBoard of Public Works, says:\r\n\r\n  “The riparian right of water-users are great, and could not be\r\n  purchased for $2,000,000. The water for this purpose can not be\r\n  spared. The canal is fed as far as Middletown, by a feeder from Mad\r\n  River. At Middletown we feed it from the Miami, which furnishes its\r\n  supply of water to Cincinnati, a distance of forty-four miles. The\r\n  Middletown Hydraulic Company have owned their rights since 1808,\r\n  long before the canal was constructed; and when the canal was built\r\n  there was no surrender of such right, merely common consent to the\r\n  use of the water, but since that time more than double the amount\r\n  of water is used than was contemplated.\r\n\r\n  “By taking water to Cincinnati from the river, you injure the\r\n  power supplied by the river at all points between Middletown and\r\n  Cincinnati, and you would find great objections raised by users\r\n  of power along the canal. The power derived from the canal is the\r\n  life-blood of the town of Middletown, and of the mills along its\r\n  banks--at Excello, Woodsdale, Rockdale, Hamilton, Rialto, Port\r\n  Union, Crescentville, Lockland, and other places. The mills have\r\n  large interests, and would not surrender their rights without a\r\n  struggle.\r\n\r\n  “A large portion of the water of the Miami, and at the present\r\n  time we might say half the volume of the water of the river is\r\n  carried into Cincinnati by the canal. This is more than was ever\r\n  contemplated, and is destined to injure the water-power of the\r\n  river itself.”\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of the canal in the city, will no doubt be\r\naccomplished within a short time, when provisions should be made to\r\nprovide a better use for this surplus water than turning it into\r\nMillcreek.\r\n\r\nMonthly and annual quantity of water from rain and snow reduced to\r\nwater, in inches and hundredths, at Cincinnati, Ohio.

The committee consisted of L. A.\r\nHarris, mayor; Thos. H. Weasner, president of council; D. T. Woodrow,\r\nHenry Pearce, and Henry Kessler, trustees of water-works, Geo. F.\r\nDavis, Wm. P. Wiltsee, and Chas. Brown, who succeeded R. B. Moore,\r\nmembers of council; and A. W. Gilbert, city engineer. They secured\r\nthe services of the most eminent of engineers, John P. Kirkwood, of\r\nNew York. His instructions were to ascertain the most economical and\r\npractical mode of supplying pure water, either from the gathering\r\ngrounds by gravity, or by pumping from the Ohio River. No scheme was\r\nto be considered that would not provide at least thirty millions\r\ndaily, with resources for future necessities.

The hardness; 2. The\r\ncontamination of richly manured farms; 3. The uncertainty of the\r\navailability of the water-sheds. To produce the thirty millions it\r\nrequired the combined area of Clear and Gregory creeks, besides large\r\nstorage reservoirs for dry seasons. The distance of latter creek is\r\n38 miles from the city, and 15 feet below flow-line of Eden Reservoir.\r\n\r\nHe considered the waters of the Ohio most preferable _providing the\r\nwater was taken above the city limits_. The plan embraced a pumping\r\nservice with two lifts, to be located in Pendleton, with storage and\r\nsettling reservoirs and filter-beds. The elevation of reservoir was\r\n200 feet above low water, and would not supply elevations above 175\r\nfeet. The estimates were:\r\n\r\n  Three settling reservoirs,                                  $381,436.02\r\n  Two filter-beds,                                             514,220.50\r\n  Storage reservoir of 39 acres,                               635,386.50\r\n  Pumping house and foundations for low service works,         194,822.80\r\n  Pumping house and foundations for high service works,         77,285.75\r\n  Pumping engines--two for low service and two for high\r\n      service, 30 millions capacity,                           402,500.00\r\n  Force-main, with river inlets,                               119,979.50\r\n  Forty-two-inch supply main to Third Street Reservoir,        457,355.00\r\n  Lands and damages, etc.,                                     105,225.00\r\n  Auxiliary pumping engine and reservoir for Walnut Hills,     150,000.00\r\n                                                            -------------\r\n                             Total,                         $3,038,214.07\r\n\r\nThe majority of the committee in recommending the plan stated; “that\r\nthey regarded the question, as to the source of supply, as definitely\r\nsettled for all time, that the Ohio River is the only means from\r\nwhence this city should derive her supply of water. The site is as\r\nhigh up the river as can well be obtained without crossing the Little\r\nMiami.” This latter consideration they thought would be demanded\r\nfifty or one hundred years hence. The minority report recommended\r\nthe retaining of the present system, and the construction of a new\r\nreservoir in Eden Park,--the minority report was adopted. Had the\r\nEden Reservoir been completed within a reasonable period it would\r\nhave served the purpose intended, at least for a few years, but\r\nbefore it was ready for use the consumption of water increased from\r\nfive, to seventeen millions daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 5.\r\n\r\nOHIO RIVER.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio River above Cincinnati has a water-shed area, estimated by\r\nU. S. Census Bureau, of 100,000 square miles, one-tenth of which\r\nis of limestone formation. The hardness of the water varies in\r\nproportion to the contribution from this formation. The water, at\r\nthe mouth of the Big Sandy, is .8 of a degree hardness; at Markley\r\nFarm, 4½ to 8; at Dayton sand-beach, 7 to 8; at pump-works, 6 to 8;\r\nEden reservoir, 7 to 9; Eggleston Avenue sewer, 7 to 13; wells in\r\nthe banks of the river at Dayton sand-beach, 32 to 39; and those at\r\nSedamsville 50 to 60 degrees. The well water is upland surface water.\r\nIn fact, all borings in the banks of the river secure, in more or\r\nless degree, this nature of water.\r\n\r\nIn the south-western part of this State, the river flows over\r\nthe bedded rocks of the Cincinnati group, its waters alternately\r\nimpinging on one side of its banks, and depositing its earthy\r\nmatters, through the influence of sluggish currents and eddies, on\r\nthe opposite side, and forming what might be termed accidental beds,\r\nas in the case of the Dayton sand-beach. The material deposited is an\r\nargillaceous substance; and, with the friction and influence of the\r\nwater, is partly transformed into quicksand. The beds do not form a\r\npart of the river in low water, as depicted by the sketch in the last\r\nreport of the Board of Health.\r\n\r\nThe sediment in the Mississippi water, at St. Louis, is nearly two\r\nper cent. of the bulk of the water; the largest portion (944 in\r\n1,000) depositing itself within 24 hours. The Ohio River water,\r\nat this point, is, at times, almost as bad. The sediment forms a\r\ntenacious and impervious clay, so susceptible of solidification that\r\nconductors of river water are only kept open by a constant flow of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe volume of water passing down the Ohio River is an extremely\r\nvariable one. No special gauging, however, has ever been made to\r\nascertain the quality; but from the surface velocities, measured by\r\nthe Chief Engineer of the Southern Railway, we can approximately\r\narrive at the figures\r\n\r\n  At 3-foot stage, by Water-Works mark, the velocity was .97 miles per hour.\r\n  “  6   “    “    “    “     “    “     “     “      “ 1.125  “    “   “\r\n  “ 18   “    “    “    “     “    “     “     “      “ 3.51   “    “   “\r\n  “ 21   “    “    “    “     “    “     “     “      “ 3.20   “    “   “\r\n  “ 27   “    “    “    “     “    “     “     “      “ 4.70   “    “   “\r\n  “ 31   “    “    “    “     “    “     “     “      “ 4.30   “    “   “\r\n  “ 41   “    “    “    “     “    “     “     “      “ 5.002  “    “   “\r\n\r\nThe slope of water surface, from water-works to bridge, was .367 of a\r\nfoot for low stage; for average stage, .403 of a foot; and .415 of a\r\nfoot per mile for high stage. The approximate flow of water in cubic\r\nfeet per second at the Southern Railway Bridge is 5,000 feet for\r\nminimum stage, 100,000 feet for mean stage, and 400,000 for maximum\r\nstage. The minimum flow of the Schuylkill is 378 cubic feet per\r\nsecond; the Delaware, 2,000 cubic feet; the Merrimack, 2,100 cubic\r\nfeet; and the Thames River, 700 cubic feet.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of the influence on our climate, by the removal of the\r\nforests, develop the fact that streams, utilized for water-power,\r\nhave become less constant in their flow than formerly. The Ohio River\r\nhas of late years exhibited greater fluctuations of levels than ever\r\nknown, and has lost its prestige as a reliable channel of navigation.\r\nProf. Newburg, in Vol. I of the Geological Survey of Ohio, records an\r\ninstant where a large rock, at Smith’s Ferry, has recently become so\r\nfully exposed that on its surface inscriptions were found, that are\r\nascribed to a race which once populated this country anterior to the\r\nnomadic Indians.\r\n\r\nThere are about 78 villages and towns and 13 cities on the Ohio\r\nRiver between Cincinnati and Pittsburgh, a distance of 460 miles.\r\nThe population on this portion of the river, and its contributing\r\nstreams, is over 3½ millions. The average population, per square mile\r\nof drainage area, on the Ohio River is 47; above Cincinnati, 35;\r\non the Great Miami, 109; on the Delaware, 176; on the Hudson, 172;\r\non the Merrimack, 92½; on the Susquehanna, 62; on the Connecticut,\r\n78; on the Potomac, 54; on the Schuylkill, 45; on the Thames, above\r\nwater-works, 300.\r\n\r\nConsiderable space has been devoted to River Pollution, to which\r\nattention is directed. The following remarks, however, afford\r\ncomparative results for the Ohio River.\r\n\r\nThe comparative merits of river waters, as expressed in analytic\r\nresults of pounds of sewage in each million gallons, are, for the\r\nOhio water at Dayton sand-beach, .82; at Markley Farm, 1.00; at\r\nthe pumping works, 1.81; at Eden reservoir, 1.78; at Eggleston\r\nAvenue sewer, 4.41; the Croton water, New York, .98; Glasgow,\r\nScotland, water, .65; Thames River, 4.91; London supply, 1.33; Fresh\r\npond, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1.50; Mystic River, Boston, 1.87;\r\nSchuylkill River, Philadelphia, 1.58; Merrimack, above Lowell, .93;\r\nabove Lawrence, .90; below Lawrence, 1.03.\r\n\r\nThe Thames and Lea Rivers have been condemned by the Rivers Pollution\r\nCommission because, as they say, there is no hope of remedying their\r\ndisgusting condition, notwithstanding the parliamentary laws for\r\ntheir protection against pollution.\r\n\r\nThe Schuylkill River is the principal source of supply for\r\nPhiladelphia, but its water is very suspicious. Above Reading, it is\r\nunfit for manufacturing and culinary purposes, owing to the large\r\namount of sulphuric acid. This acid is, however, neutralized and\r\nconsiderably reduced before the water reaches Philadelphia. The\r\nFairmount pool is polluted by cess-pool and slaughter-house drainage.\r\nThe following means to restore and maintain the purity of the\r\nSchuylkill water has been suggested by Dr. Cresson:\r\n\r\n  1. The diversion of all sewage, now flowing into the pool of\r\n  Fairmount dam, into another channel.\r\n\r\n  2. The diversion of all sewage, containing fœcal and animal matter,\r\n  flowing into the river below Flat Rock.\r\n\r\n  3. The filtration of the sewage from all mills, to exclude solid\r\n  matter, animal or vegetable.\r\n\r\n  4. The exclusion of ammonia waste and surface wash from gas-works,\r\n  cemeteries, etc.\r\n\r\n  5. The cultivation of fish and of suitable plant life in and upon\r\n  the waters of the river.\r\n\r\n  6. The erection of suitable cascades over the reservoirs, so as to\r\n  secure the benefits of aeration to as great extent as possible.\r\n\r\n  7. The employment of proper prophylactic and curative agents as\r\n  occasion may require.\r\n\r\nBoston obtained legislative power to protect Pegan Brook from sewage\r\npollution. Test cases, to compel manufacturers to provide some\r\nother means of disposing of their drainage, were carried to the\r\nSupreme Court, and decided in favor of the city. Similar cases will\r\nbe brought against other offenders. In the meantime the pollution\r\ncontinues. The same authorities procured a law to protect Mystic\r\nLake, and provide other channels for sewage. The provisions of the\r\nact were held to be impracticable, and the law is now a dead letter.\r\n\r\nThe self-purification of river water is not recognized by some\r\nauthorities, but equally good authorities value its merits. The\r\nfollowing observations on this subject are particularly applicable to\r\nCincinnati:\r\n\r\n  “The most efficacious means to get rid of the sewage is not to put\r\n  it into the river at all.\r\n\r\n  “A chemist can tell you the amount of organic matter contained in\r\n  the water, but that covers an infinite variety of matters. He has\r\n  no means of discrimination as to what is really the ferment--the\r\n  infectious material--of cholera from a great number of other\r\n  organic matters.\r\n\r\n  “The question is, not whether the chemist would find out the\r\n  organic matter, so much as it is, whether the germs that\r\n  disseminate the disease still have their property further down\r\n  the river. This can only be solved by the effects. _You might\r\n  go on using the water for years, and it might not be discovered\r\n  until some outbreak of disease occurs directly attributable to the\r\n  water._”\r\n\r\nThe practical sanitary experiment would then be solved, but at the\r\nexpense of a number of lives.\r\n\r\nDr. Klob, of Vienna, has discovered, in the evacuations of cholera\r\npatients, millions and millions of microscopic fungi similar in form\r\nto a mushroom.\r\n\r\nThere are, above the Cincinnati pumping works, six sewers discharging\r\ntheir filth into the Ohio River, besides the fœcal drainage of no\r\nless than five thousand privies, all within a radius of less than\r\nthree miles. Now, the quality of such water is readily established,\r\nfor we are putting the sewage into the water knowing there are no\r\nmeans to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOHIO RIVER STATEMENT, SHOWING THE HIGHEST, LOWEST, AND AVERAGE STAGES\r\nFOR EACH YEAR AT CINCINNATI WATER-WORKS.\r\n\r\n  =====+========================++=========================+===========\r\n       |                        ||                         |AVERAGE FOR\r\n  YEAR.|    HIGHEST STAGE.      ||    LOWEST STAGE.        | THE YEAR.\r\n       +-------------+-----+----++--------------+-----+----+-----+----\r\n       |    DATE.    |FEET.| IN.||    DATE.     |FEET.| IN.|FEET.| IN.\r\n  -----+-------------+-----+----++--------------+-----+----+-----+----\r\n  1832 |February 18  | 62  | 11½||              |     |    |     |\r\n  1847 |December 17  | 62  |  3½||              |     |    |     |\r\n  1858 |June 16      | 43  | 10 ||October 3d    |  2  |  5 | 12  | 10\r\n  1859 |February 22d | 55  |  5 ||September 19th|  3  |  3 | 17  |  7\r\n  1860 |April 16th   | 49  |  2 ||October 3d    |  5  |  4 | 16  | --\r\n  1861 |April 19th   | 49  |  5 ||July 13th     |  5  |  1 | 19  |  1\r\n  1862 |January 24th | 57  |  4 ||October 31st  |  2  |  4 | 17  |  5\r\n  1863 |March 12th   | 42  |  9 ||October 6th   |  2  |  6 | 15  | --\r\n  1864 |December 23d | 45  |  1 ||August 6th    |  3  |  1 | 16  |  8\r\n  1865 |March 7th    | 56  |  3 ||October 19th  |  5  |  8 | 21  | 10\r\n  1866 |September 26 | 42  |  6 ||August 17th   |  4  |  9 | 19  |  2\r\n  1867 |March 14     | 55  |  8 ||October 19th  |  3  | -- | 17  | --\r\n  1868 |March 30th   | 48  |  3 ||July 21st     |  5  |  1 | 18  |  8\r\n  1869 |April 2d     | 48  |  9 ||August 21st   |  5  |  4 | 19  |  8\r\n  1870 |January 19th | 55  |  3 ||October 4th   |  3  | 10 | 17  | 10\r\n  1871 |May 13th     | 40  |  6 ||October 12th  |  2  |  8 | 11  | 10\r\n  1872 |April 13th   | 41  |  9 ||October 14th  |  3  | -- | 11  |  8\r\n  1873 |December 18th| 44  |  5 ||October 1?th  |  3  |  8 | 18  |  5\r\n  1874 |January 11th | 47  | 11 ||September 22d |  2  |  4 | 15  |  8\r\n  1875 |August 6th   | 55  |  4 ||September 19th|  4  |  3 | 18  |  9\r\n  1876 |January 29th | 51  |  9 ||September 4th |  6  |  2 | 18  |  2\r\n  1877 |January 20th | 53  |  9 ||October 9th   |  3  |  3 | 15  | --\r\n  1878 |December 15th| 41  |  4 ||October 24th  |  4  |  4 | 16  |  9\r\n  1879 |December 27th| 42  |  9 ||October 23d   |  2  |  6 | 14  |  6\r\n  1880 |February 17th| 53  |  2 ||October 28th  |  3  |  9 | 17  | --\r\n  1881 |February 16th| 50  |  7 ||September 18th|  1  | 11 | 16  | 11\r\n  =====+========================++=========================+===========\r\n\r\nA recent examination of the currents of the river passing the inlets\r\nwas conclusive that the Eggleston Avenue sewer, 1,000 feet below,\r\ncould have no effect on our water supply. Be this as it may, its\r\nproximity taxes our delicate tastes. The location of the inlet of\r\nthe Shield aqueduct is not a desirable one, being at the revetment\r\nwall, past which all the shore water flows. The small aqueduct\r\ncertainly can not be improved, its inlet being sixty feet beyond the\r\nwall, where the currents produce the best water obtainable.\r\n\r\nThe value of changing the location of the intakes can be illustrated\r\nto a good advantage by the experience of London during the cholera\r\nepidemic of 1854. After the epidemic of 1849, the Lambeth Water\r\nCompany moved their intakes to Teddington, beyond the range of London\r\nsewage; while their competitor, the Southwark Company, continued\r\nto take its water close to one of the sewers. Their respective\r\nwater-pipes interlaced each other; and of the 26,000 houses supplied\r\nby the Lambeth Company, there were only 294 deaths in 1854, while in\r\n40,000 houses, supplied by the other company, there were 2,284 deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOWDEN’S SURVEY OF MARKLEY FARM.\r\n\r\nOn the 29th of April, 1871, the Trustees of Water-Works, in response\r\nto the Council, submitted a report to them upon the necessity of a\r\nnew water supply. On the ensuing 9th of June, the Council ordered\r\nthat a competent engineer be employed to examine sites, and report\r\nupon the most suitable location for water-works, with plans,\r\nestimates of cost, etc. Mr. T. R. Scowden was accordingly appointed;\r\nand, on the 9th of September of the same year, he submitted a\r\nsupplemental report, recommending, in the highest terms, the “Markley\r\nFarm” site. Upon his recommendation, the property was purchased for\r\nthe sum of $22,321.50, consisting of 146 acres, with a river frontage\r\nof 2,000 feet. The principal points upon which the recommendation was\r\nbased were:\r\n\r\n  “The site known as Markley Farm is a point where the water of the\r\n  Ohio River is deep and free from drainage or any other vitiating\r\n  influence to affect its quality, perhaps for a century to come,\r\n  if ever. The shore is bold, and, with the bed of the river, is\r\n  of gravel and rock formation, washed clean by an active current\r\n  at all seasons of the year. Pumping works may be located at this\r\n  point without any objectionable and expensive inlet-pipe; while the\r\n  adjacent hills afford an excellent site for a storage reservoir,\r\n  307 feet above extreme low water, and 75 feet above the Garden of\r\n  Eden Reservoir. On the lower level there is a fine plateau for\r\n  locating, not only the pumping house, but subsiding reservoirs and\r\n  filtering basins.\r\n\r\n  “The force-main extending from the pump house to the storage\r\n  reservoir will be short, or about 1,450 feet long, whereas, works\r\n  located on the second site, or any other sites examined, would\r\n  require force mains several thousand feet in length. By the first\r\n  site, water from the river would be lifted by the pumps and\r\n  forced to the reservoir with the least amount of power, friction,\r\n  and expense of fuel to do the work. This site also commands an\r\n  excellent and safe landing for boats supplying the works with coal.\r\n\r\n  “The analyses of waters lately taken at the Water-Works and at the\r\n  Markley Farm clearly indicate the superior quality, purity, and\r\n  healthfulness of the latter.\r\n\r\n  “It has been suggested that the offal from one or more\r\n  distilleries, said to be in operation at New Richmond, some ten\r\n  miles above the Markley Farm, would leave its taint in the water\r\n  reaching the latter point. My answer is, that in this case the\r\n  river, so slightly affected at New Richmond, and flowing ten miles\r\n  to reach the Markley Farm, would, from agitation and dilution, and\r\n  from the well-known self-purifying property of water, become pure.”\r\n\r\nRegarding the other sites surveyed he said:\r\n\r\n  “The second, but objectionable, site for water-works was found some\r\n  three miles above the Garden of Eden reservoir, and about the same\r\n  distance below the mouth and offensive discharge of the Little\r\n  Miami River. This location, although favorable in many respects,\r\n  intercepts the drainage of the upper portion of the city, and all\r\n  of that from the Miami Valley emptied into the Ohio River, which\r\n  renders that site wholly inadmissible for water-works purposes.\r\n\r\n  “The valley of the Miami forms a water-shed of several hundred\r\n  square miles in area. Upon the surface of this vast plain is\r\n  deposited the dead carcasses of animals, and the droppings\r\n  from cattle of all kinds. The ground is covered with decayed\r\n  vegetable matter, and the soaking of stable-yards, hog-pens,\r\n  slaughter-houses, distilleries, stagnant pools, etc. The refuse\r\n  is washed off by rain storms into the Miami, which is the common\r\n  receptacle, and thence into the Ohio River.\r\n\r\n  “It is only necessary, first, to disease the water, then disease\r\n  the man; and it is clear, therefore, that water-works located\r\n  below the Miami would, by wholesale pollution, disease the whole\r\n  community.\r\n\r\n  “There is no city in the civilized world so regardless of the\r\n  cleanliness and health of its citizens as to adopt a plan of water\r\n  supply to foist upon them the concentrated filth from sewerage and\r\n  the impurities of a stream, the water of which is only fit for\r\n  mill-power, manufacturing purposes, and for cattle to drink; and I\r\n  did not think that Cincinnati was emulous of setting the example.\r\n\r\n  “With regard to intermediate points between the county line and\r\n  the mouth of the Little Miami River, I found the Ohio River lined\r\n  with sand-bars, some of which projected from the shore nearly to\r\n  the middle of the river, miles in length; while the bottom or bed\r\n  of the river was, for the most part, covered with logs and craggy\r\n  stones.”\r\n\r\nHis plan embraced the construction of pumping works for raising the\r\nwater, first, from the river into subsiding and filter reservoirs,\r\nand then pumping it a second time into storage reservoirs. The water\r\nwas to flow, through 10⅓ miles of 42-inch supply mains, into Eden\r\nReservoir. The capacity of the pumps was estimated at 60 millions\r\ndaily. The recapitulation of cost was:\r\n\r\n  For Engine-House and Grounds             $  312,790.00\r\n  For Pumping Engines                         750,000.00\r\n  For Force Mains                              92,130.00\r\n  For Storage Reservoirs                      521,529.45\r\n  For Subsiding Reservoirs                    560,252.00\r\n  For Clear-Water Well                         14,669.60\r\n  For principal Supply Main, two lines      1,811,078.00\r\n  Miscellaneous expenses                       60,500.00\r\n                                            ------------  4,131,949.05\r\n              Add ten per cent                              413,194.90\r\n                                                         -------------\r\n              Total cost                                 $4,545,143.95\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, he said:\r\n\r\n  “I, therefore, regard the first and best site, known as the Markley\r\n  Farm, as one commanding all the advantages sought, where works may\r\n  be erected combining greater simplicity of construction, economy of\r\n  cost, and maintenance when put in operation, than could be built at\r\n  any of the other points mentioned.”\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. 7.\r\n\r\nMOORE’S SURVEY.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of January, 1882, Mr. A. G. Moore, Superintendent of the\r\nCincinnati Water-Works, submitted a communication to the Board of\r\nPublic Works relative to the present condition of the pumping works\r\nand its future requirements. From it we arrange the following:\r\n\r\n  “The present pumps are deficient; that during the summer of 1881\r\n  the daily demands exceeded, at times, their capacity; and on one\r\n  particular day there was a deficiency of over six million gallons.\r\n  The engines are generally of light construction, and not sufficient\r\n  for any increased loads. They are expensive in operation and\r\n  maintenance. First-class engines of to-day would save two-thirds of\r\n  the fuel used. The principal reliance, during the summer, is the\r\n  large “Shield” engine, which is most extravagant on fuel, and has\r\n  a wrought-iron force-main, of weak material, intrenched 35 feet\r\n  below the surface of the street. Some of the boilers are of an age\r\n  that require them to be treated with the greatest care, and should\r\n  be condemned. The principal buildings do not afford protection or\r\n  access to the pumps in case of derangement during average high\r\n  water. The hill-top service is inadequate, and a larger and more\r\n  comprehensive system should be adopted for the supply of the\r\n  increasing territory.\r\n\r\n  “The subject of increasing capacity requires immediate attention;\r\n  and should the removal of the works be deemed inadvisable, it will\r\n  become essential to at once proceed with the erection of machinery,\r\n  buildings, aqueduct, and aqua-fort at the old works. The cost of\r\n  these improvements is placed at $1,394,000; reserve engine for\r\n  1884, $618,000; and sewer in Front Street, to carry the sewage\r\n  below the works, $1,600,000. Total, $3,612,000.”\r\n\r\nHis plan for Markley Farm provides for one lift of 305 feet, with\r\nthree compound pumping engines of 100 million capacity, subsiding and\r\nstorage reservoirs, and one effluent-main 62 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe estimate is condensed as follows:\r\n\r\n  Aqua-fort and buildings                                   $ 410,000.00\r\n  Engines and boilers for 100 million capacity              1,255,000.00\r\n\r\n  Three subsiding reservoirs of earth and masonry        }\r\n      embankments, with 90 acres of water surface        }  1,836,500.00\r\n\r\n  Effluent-main, including 55,000 feet of 62-inch pipe,  }\r\n      from the Farm to Eden Reservoir, and 18,000 feet   }  1,804,000.00\r\n      of 48-inch, from Eden Reservoir to Harrison Avenue }\r\n  Contingencies                                               460,000.00\r\n                                                           -------------\r\n      Total                                                $5,725,000.00\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important question is presented by him, which the public must\r\ndecide, namely, whether it is a prudent policy to expend four\r\nmillions of dollars to improve the old works, and retain all the\r\nexpensive and unreliable machinery, and still supply an impure and\r\nturbid water; or to expend an additional two millions for an entire\r\nnew system, from a source where a supply of pure and clear water can\r\nbe secured, commensurate with the growing city.\r\n\r\nHe also embodies, by way of comparison, the following estimate for\r\nlocating the works on the Kentucky side of the river:\r\n\r\n  For right of way and property, State and municipal         500,000\r\n  Aqua-fort and buildings                                    410,000\r\n  Three engines, with boilers complete                     1,255,000\r\n  Subsiding Reservoirs                                     1,836,000\r\n  Effluent-mains, 23,000 feet                                533,000\r\n  Tunnel for pumping main                                    270,000\r\n  Tunnel under the Ohio River, 3,000 feet                    825,000\r\n   Thirty-inch main to Eastern Avenue, 22,500 feet           201,000\r\n  Contingencies                                              550,000\r\n                                                          ----------\r\n      Total for Newport plan                              $6,381,000\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCOST OF CONSTRUCTING WATER-WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cost of constructing water-works varies very much, according\r\nto local features, geological structure, and kind of scheme most\r\nsuitable to the place. In Great Britain, gravitation schemes cost\r\nfrom $10 to $13, and pumping schemes from $7 to $10, per inhabitant.\r\nThe average cost per head, for London, was $20; for Liverpool, $20;\r\nfor Bradford, England, $35; for Halifax, England, $25; for Dundee,\r\nScotland, $30; for Glasgow, $15; for Manchester and Sheffield (each)\r\n$12 per head.\r\n\r\nThe average cost for a supply of 20 imperial gallons per day, per\r\nhead, for 66 towns of Great Britain having gravitation supplies,\r\nwas $8; for 48 towns, with pumping system, $5.80; and for 11 towns,\r\nhaving both systems, $7. From the annual report of Chicago, for 1880,\r\nwe take the following cost, per capita, for water-works construction:\r\nDetroit, $23.11; Newark, N. J., $19.08; Wilmington, Del., $20.73;\r\nBuffalo, $18.29; Cincinnati, $26.20; Milwaukee, $19.25; Columbus, O.,\r\n$18.14; Louisville, Ky., $25.04; Cleveland, O., $16.84; Providence,\r\nR. I., $52.74; Boston (gravity supply), $44.46; Manchester, N. H.\r\n(water pumping power), $24.24; Hartford, Conn. (gravity), $35.60; New\r\nYork (gravity), $34.38, St. Louis, $26.07; Chicago, $17.49.\r\n\r\nThe _Engineering News_, of New York, Vol. IX, No. 4, contains\r\nvaluable tables on construction, and other valuable water-works\r\nstatistics, from which the following is compiled:\r\n\r\n  Average cost of construction, per capita, for American cities\r\n  having stand-pipe system, with 50,000 population, $20.70; for\r\n  30,000, $12; for 15,000, $16; for 10,000, $13.30.\r\n\r\n  Average cost of construction, per capita, for direct pumping\r\n  system, for 75,000, $16; for 40,000, $13.40; for 25,000, $13.80;\r\n  for 15,000, $21.70; for 10,000, $16.40; for 5,000, from $8 to $12.\r\n\r\n  Average cost of construction, per capita, for reservoir pumping\r\n  system, for 100,000 population, $22.50; for 75,000, $21.50; for\r\n  50,000, $15.25; for 35,000, $22.50; for 25,000, $33.20; for 15,000,\r\n  $22.40; for 10,000, from $10 to $32; for 5,000, from $8 to $40.\r\n\r\n  Average cost of construction, per capita, for gravitation works,\r\n  for 50,000 population, $26; for 30,000, from $17 to $40; for\r\n  20,000, from $16 to $30; for 10,000, from $10 to $30; for 5,000,\r\n  from $5 to $25; for 3,000, from $17 to $40.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVENUE AND EXPENSE.\r\n\r\nThe average water-rent receipts, for 1880, per mile of water pipe\r\nin use, was $2,022 for Chicago, $3,200 for New York, $1,932 for\r\nPhiladelphia, $2,730 for Boston, $3,307 for Brooklyn, $2,183 for\r\nBaltimore, $3,112 for St. Louis, $2,647 for Cincinnati, $1,600 for\r\nLouisville, $1,611 for Cleveland, $1,821 for Detroit, $2,060 for\r\nBuffalo, $1,500 for Milwaukee, $1,746 for Indianapolis; $1,128 for\r\nColumbus, Ohio, $3,556 for Pittsburgh, $397 for Washington, and $618\r\nfor Toledo, Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe cost of maintenance, for stand-pipe system, varies from 10 to 90\r\nper cent. of revenue; for direct pumping, from 30 to 140 per cent.\r\nof revenue; for reservoir pumping, for large cities, from 12 to 37\r\nper cent. of revenue; for small cities, from 12 to 120 per cent.\r\nof revenue; and new works, from 12 to 60 per cent. of revenue; for\r\ngravitation works, from 13 to 120 per cent. of revenue.\r\n\r\nThe revenue and the cost of maintenance (exclusive of interest), for\r\neach 1,000 gallons of water pumped, are respectively: Philadelphia,\r\n5.77 and 1.28 cents; St. Louis, 6.91 and 2.55 cents; Chicago, 4.12\r\nand 1.18 cents; Detroit, 4.09 and 82 cents; Buffalo, 3.50 and 1.00\r\ncents; New York, 4.7 and one cent; Cleveland, 5.43 and 1.5 cents;\r\nCincinnati, 7.01 and 2.6 cents.\r\n\r\nThe revenue received, for each 1,000 gallons delivered, is 15.52\r\ncents at Liverpool, England; 14.35 cents at Berlin, Germany; 8.13\r\ncents at Dresden, and 4 cents at Hamburg.\r\n\r\nThe comparative annual water-rent charges for a large house, in\r\ndifferent cities, are as follows: Columbus, Ohio, $23.50; Lawrence,\r\nMass., $20; Providence, R. I., $31; Brooklyn, $29.25; Buffalo,\r\n$43.50; Detroit, $23.25; Cincinnati, $28.73; Cleveland, $21.50;\r\nChicago, $34; Philadelphia, $27.75; Pittsburgh, $71.50; Milwaukee,\r\n$34.50; Louisville, $51.50.\r\n\r\nThe meter rate charges, per 1,000 gallons, are 10 to 40 cents at\r\nBoston; 10 cents at Chicago; 10.2 at Cincinnati; 7 to 20 at Columbus,\r\nOhio; 15 cents at Brooklyn; 13½ at Baltimore; 6 to 12 at Cleveland;\r\n20 to 30 at Buffalo; 15 cents at Philadelphia; 7½ cents at New York;\r\nand 30 cents at Providence, Rhode Island.\r\n\r\nThe meter rates, per 1,000 U. S. gallons, at Stuttgart, Germany,\r\nare 11 cents for filtered river water, 5½ cents for lake water, and\r\n15 cents for spring water. The rates, at Frankfort-on-the-Main, are\r\n3.7 to 5 cents; at Hamburg, Germany, 8½ cents; at Leipsic, 7½ to 9¼\r\ncents; at Berlin, Germany, 6½ to 25½ cents; at Dublin, Ireland, 6½ to\r\n11 cents; and at Glasgow, Scotland, 15 cents per 1,000 U. S. gallons.\r\n\r\nThe average dividend paid by the water companies of Great Britain, in\r\n1870, was 7 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER PIPES.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of water pipes in use are made of wood,\r\ncast-iron, wrought-iron, and glass. For adapting wrought pipe to\r\npractical use, various methods have been resorted to, that of coating\r\nwith asphaltum, enameling, galvanizing, and lining inside and\r\ncovering outside with cement. The latter method has been adopted by a\r\nnumber of water-works; but the liability to corrosion, from imperfect\r\nwork and material, has caused its abandonment in a number of places.\r\nThe Spring Valley Water Company, of San Francisco, have in use a\r\nnumber of wrought-iron riveted pipes, coated with asphaltum, of 20 to\r\n42 inches in diameter. They are made of No. 12 to 14 iron (Birmingham\r\nwire gauge), and have a hydrostatic pressure upon them of from 200\r\nto 400 feet. Virginia City (Nevada) water-works laid two lines of\r\nwrought-iron pipe across the Washoe Valley, 7½ miles wide--one of\r\n12-inch riveted pipe, and the other of 10-inch enameled, lap-welded\r\ntubes. The pressure on the pipe at the bottom of the valley is 750\r\npounds. The enormous pressure has caused a number of rivets to give\r\nout. On the test for the respective capacities, the 10-inch pipe\r\ndelivered 2½ millions per day, against two millions for the 12-inch\r\npipe.\r\n\r\nHard water has but little effect on cast-iron pipe, due to the\r\ncarbonates; but soft water attacks it so vigorously, that it not only\r\ngives a turbid appearance to the water, but seriously weakens the\r\npipe by corrosion, and the consequent formation of concretions that\r\nreduce the capacity of the pipe. Hard water also causes the formation\r\nof lime deposits, that offer great impediments to the flow of water.\r\nThese obstructions are now removed by boring tools forced through the\r\npipe by the hydrostatic pressure. The Superintendent of the Halifax\r\n(N. S.) Water-Works records the cleansing of a 12-inch main, 32,000\r\nfeet long, in three-fourths of an hour. The preservation of cast-iron\r\npipes, and the prevention of these concretions, are now accomplished\r\nby carefully dipping the pipe, previously heated to a temperature\r\nof 300 degrees, in a bath of distilled coal tar, mixed, to a proper\r\nconsistency, with linseed oil, or an oil of the tar.\r\n\r\nThe Rivers Pollution Commission condemned the common practice of\r\nusing hemp in pipe joints, because it affords a nidus for the\r\nbreeding, development, and decay of animalculæ. Turned joints were\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nThe results of the observations of this commission prove conclusively\r\nthan the commonly received opinion, that soft water necessarily\r\nacts upon lead pipes, is erroneous. The Loch Katrine water, which\r\nis notorious for dissolving lead in water exposed to the open air,\r\nyet no symptoms of lead poisoning have been discovered since its\r\nintroduction, eighteen years ago. The water will act upon the lead\r\nat first, but will ultimately coat the inside of the pipe with a\r\nvegetable deposit that prevents further deterioration.\r\n\r\nThe frictional head, for a given diameter, is as the square of the\r\nvelocity nearly; and, for different diameters, inversely as the\r\ndiameters. Thus the loss of head, for each 100 feet of clean cast\r\npipe, the velocity being three feet per second, is 1.35 feet for a\r\n3-inch pipe; 1.02 for a 4-inch; .679 of a foot for a 6-inch; .407 of\r\na foot for a 10-inch; .255 for a 16-inch, and .204 of a foot for a 20\r\ninch pipe. The mean coefficient of friction, for cast-iron pipes of\r\nsmall size, with velocities of three feet, is .00644 for clean pipe;\r\n.0082 for slightly tuberculated pipes, and .012 for foul pipes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHTS OF CAST-IRON PIPE, WITH ALLOWANCE ADDED FOR BOWL AND SPIGOT\r\nENDS.\r\n\r\n_Weights in columns per foot lineal.
